Statutory  Authority.  This  instruction  cites  specific  references  to  Titles  5  and  10,  United States Code (USC) and other parts of law in chapters where they apply.  Laws that apply to both Regular  and  Reserve  military  members  are  carried  out  without  discrimination  among  Regular members,  among  Reserve  members,  and  between  Regular  and  Reserve  members  (10  USC §10209).  In general, this instruction covers two categories of retirement: 1.1.1.  RegAF or Active Duty Retirement under 10 USC  Chapter 867, based on qualifying years  of  active  duty  service,  or  Chapter  63,  based  on  age.    (DoD  regulations  call  this  a “regular  retirement.”)    Both  active  component  and  ARC  members  may  be  eligible  for  an active  component  retirement  based  on  qualifying  years  of  active  duty  service.    With  some exceptions,  entitlement  to  active  component  retired  pay  and  benefits  generally  start  upon effective date of retirement from active duty service. 1.1.2.  Reserve  Retirement  under  10  USC  Chapter  1223,  based  on  qualifying  years  of creditable  service  toward  reserve  retirement  (DoD  regulations  call  this  a  “non-regular retirement”).    Both  active  component  and  ARC  members  may  be  eligible  for  a  reserve retirement  based  on  qualifying  years  of  creditable  service.    An  eligible  member  who  elects reserve retirement is considered “retired” upon approval of his/her request for transfer to the retired reserve.  Entitlement to certain retired benefits begins upon effective date of transfer to  the  retired  reserve.    However,  entitlement  to  reserve  retired  pay  does  not  begin  until  the member reaches the statutory age of eligibility. 1.1.3.  2011, H.R. 2433 and Executive Order 13518 pertaining to the Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) Act of 2011 1.2.  Department of Defense (DoD) Guidance. 1.2.1.  Retired  pay.  DoD  Financial  Management  Regulation  (DoD  7000.14-R,  Volume  7B) provides overall DoD guidance on retired pay matters. 1.2.2.  Member  and  dependent  travel  and  household  good  (HHG)  storage  and  shipment.  Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) provides overall DoD guidance on travel entitlements. 1.2.3.  Retirement.    DoD  guidance  distinguishes  active  duty  (10  USC  Chapter  867)  from Reserve  (10 USC  Chapter  1223) retirement  as  “regular” versus “non-regular,” and defines categories  of  the  retired  reserve.    See  DoDI  1215.06,  Uniform  Reserve,  Training,  and Retirement Categories, and DoDI 1215.07, Service Credit for Non-Regular Retirement. 1.2.4.  DTM  12-007,  “Implementation  of  Mandatory  Transition  Assistance  Program Participation for Eligible Service Members”   8 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 1.3.  The  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SecAF).  The  SecAF  can  make  exceptions  to  the requirements  in  this  instruction,  unless  specifically  prohibited  by  law  or  DoD  regulation.    The SecAF maintains full discretion as to whether a member’s service has been honorable, whether a member has performed satisfactorily, and whether or not to approve a member’s application for retirement or transfer to the retired reserve in lieu of pending administrative, non-judicial and/or judicial actions.  The SecAF may order retired AF members to active duty at any time (10 USC §688). 1.4.  Retirement  Effective  Date.  The  AF  can  approve  a  non-disability  active  duty  retirement effective  date  no  earlier  than  the  first  day  of  the  month  after  the  month  in  which  the  member attains basic eligibility as defined in 10 USC, Chapter 867.  RC members can be transferred to the retired reserve upon qualifying per 10 USC §12731 per paragraph  2.1.2.1. 1.5.  Retirement  Approval  Authority  (RAA).  The  SecAF  is  the  RAA  for  applications  for retirement and transfer to the retired reserve.  He/she has delegated authority in certain cases to the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (Manpower  and  Reserve  Affairs)  (SAF/MR),  with  re-delegations  within  the  Air  Force  Review  Boards  Agency  (SAF/MR)  and  to  the  Director,  SAF Personnel Council (SAF/MRB).  The Director, SAF Personnel Council has further re-delegated authority  to  designated  Special  Assistants  assigned  to  the  retirement  order  issuing  authorities listed below. 1.5.1.  The  appropriate  agency  manages  retirement  applications  and  publishes  retirement orders.  Computer-generated  orders  do  not  require  a  seal  or  signature  although  the  word “official”  must  appear  above  the  signature  element.    The  appropriate  agency  must  process any application signed by an eligible member unless prohibited by Table 2.1 or restricted by Table  2.2.  If  prohibitions  or  restrictions  apply,  the  appropriate  agency  complies  with applicable processing requirements from the respective table and Section 2C. 1.5.1.1.  AF  General  Officer  Management  Office  (AF/DPG)  manages  applications  for General Officers (GOs) and GO-selects who qualify for an active component  retirement or  apply  for  an  active  or  reserve  component  retirement  while  on  active  duty.    AF/DPG has  responsibility  for  verifying  eligibility  for  requested  retirement  dates  and  waiver-request processing. AF/DPG forwards actions to the appropriate reviewing and approval authorities.  (See also Tables 8.1 and  8.4 which cover reserve component GOs and GO selects whose retirement applications are managed by AF/REG and NGB/GO.) 1.5.1.2.  AF Colonels Management Office (AF/DPO) manages applications by active component  colonels  and  colonel-selects  who  apply  and  qualify  for  an  active component  retirement  under  10  USC  Chapter  867  or  Chapter  63.    AF/DPO  also manages applications by ARC colonels and colonel-selects that are assigned on active duty to HQ level positions, who apply and qualify for an active component retirement under 10 USC Chapter 867 (see paragraph  2.1.1.4.).  AF/DPO has responsibility for verifying  eligibility  for  requested  retirement  dates  and  waiver-request  processing.  The  SAF  Personnel  Council  has  re-delegated  authority  to  designated  Special Assistants to act as the RAA for certain retirement requests.  AF/DPO forwards those requests outside the delegated authority to the appropriate agency for approval.  AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 9 1.5.1.3.  AF  CMSgt  Management  Office  (AF/DPE)  and  AFPC  Airmen  Sustainment and  Transition  Branch  (AFPC/DP3SA)  oversee  processing  of  applications  by  active component  Chief  Master  Sergeants  (CMSgts)  and  CMSgt-selects  who  apply  and qualify  for  an  active  duty  retirement  under  10  USC  Chapter  867  or  Chapter  63. AF/DPE  and  AFPC  also  manage  applications  by  ARC  CMSgts  and  CMSgt-selects that are assigned on active duty to HQ level positions, who apply and qualify for an active component  retirement under 10 USC  Chapter  867  (see paragraph    2.1.1.4.).  AFPC  has  responsibility  for  verifying  eligibility  for  requested  retirement  dates  and processing of applications involving no waivers or retirement at HYT.  AF/DPE has responsibility  for  waiver  request  processing.    The  SAF  Personnel  Council  has  re-delegated  authority  to  designated  Special  Assistants  to  act  as  the  RAA  for  certain retirement requests.  AF/DPE forwards those requests outside the delegated authority to the appropriate agency for approval. 1.5.1.4.  AFPC Airmen Sustainment and Transition Branch (AFPC/DP3SA) oversees application processing for active component officers in the grade of lieutenant colonel (Lt  Col)  and  below  and  active  component  enlisted  personnel  in  the  grade  of  Senior Master  Sergeant  (SMSgt)  and  below  who  apply  and  qualify  for  an  active  duty retirement  under  10  USC  Chapter  867  or  Chapter  63.  AFPC  also  manages applications by ARC officers (Lt Col and below) and ARC enlisted members (SMSgt and  below)  that  are  assigned  on  active  duty  to  HQ  level  positions,  who  apply  and qualify  for  an  active  component  retirement  under  10  USC  Chapter  867.    (see paragraph    2.1.1.4.).    AFPC  has  responsibility  for  verifying  eligibility  for  requested retirement  dates  and  waiver-request  processing.  The  SAF  Personnel  Council  has  re-delegated  authority  to  designated  Special  Assistants  to  act  as  the  RAA  for  certain retirement requests.  AFPC forwards those requests outside the delegated authority to the appropriate agency for approval. 1.5.1.5.  HQ  ARPC  Retirements  Branch  (ARPC/DPTTR)  manages  applications  for  all ARC members with responsibility for verifying eligibility for requested retirement dates.  All  waiver  requests  are  processed  at  unit  level.    For  ARC  General  Officer  retirements, applications must go through AF/REG and ANG/GO prior to submission to ARPC. 1.6.  Publishing, Rescinding, and Amending Orders.  A retirement order, if regular and valid, is  final  on  the  effective  date  of  retirement.    The  RAA,  or  agency  that  manages  the  member’s retirement application or orders, will publish orders as soon as the retirement is approved.  The RAA and Military Personnel Sections (MPS) will not furnish a retiring member a letter in lieu of a retirement order to authorize a move to a Home of Selection (HOS) or Home of Record (HOR) in  conjunction  with  retirement.    The  retirement  order  or  a  message  from  the  orders issuing/publishing authority  approving the retirement with  the retirement order number  and the retirement order date serve as the only documents that authorize the entitlement (JTR, paragraph 5208.E. and Comptroller General  Decision 52 Comp  Gen 769  - 1973). The appropriate agency may  only  revoke,  rescind,  or  amend  the  order  if  fraud,  manifest  error,  mathematical  error, mistake of law, or substantial  new  evidence renders the order invalid.   The appropriate  agency may amend or rescind retirement orders when, in rare circumstances such as medical hold, civil confinement,  or  prohibiting  conditions  listed  in  Table  2.1  or  restrictions  listed  in  Table  2.2,  a member cannot complete retirement processing before the effective retirement date. 10 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 1.7.  Commander’s  Responsibilities  .    The  AF  assigns  commanders  the  responsibility  to identify  restrictions  to  retirement  that  may  apply  until  midnight  on  the  member’s  final  day  on active  duty,  Date  of  Separation  (DOS),  Expiration  Term  of  Service  (ETS),  or  Mandatory Separation Date (MSD).  If the commander knows of any restrictions applicable to the member’s application  for  active  component  retirement  or  transfer  to  the  retired  reserve  prior  to  the member’s  retirement  effective  date  (Table  2.1  and/or  Table  2.2.),  the  commander  must immediately contact the appropriate agency to request the AF suspend the retirement (T-0). 1.7.1.  The member’s commander or base Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) immediately  notifies the  RAA  and  sends  documents  to  justify  an  amendment  to  or  rescission  of  the  retirement order (T-0).   If the appropriate office is  not  notified promptly  and the member’s retirement consummates, the commander or base SJA must notify the RAA to determine if a manifest error has occurred.  See the Retirements PSD guide for this process.  If no manifest error has occurred, the member must apply to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) for corrective action.  A computer-generated order is used to amend or rescind the retirement. 1.7.2.  The AF authorizes the member’s commander, civilian equivalent, or person delegated the  authority  by  the  commander  or  civilian  equivalent  to  coordinate  on  a  member’s retirement application.  The designated authority identifies restrictions listed in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2, both upon submission of the application and until the member’s retirement date.  If restrictions apply after a retirement is approved, immediately notify the RAA. 1.8.  Requesting  Retirement  .  The Retirements  Personnel  Services Delivery  Guide is  located in  myPers  on  the  AFPC  website  and  contains  specific  procedures  for  submitting  active component  retirement  applications.    Applications  for  reserve  component  Colonels  and  below retirements  are  submitted  via  the  vPC.    For  AFR  General  Officers,  contact  AF/REG  to  initiate retirement applications.  For ANG General Officers, submit applications for retirement through ANG/GO. 1.9.  Transition  Assistance  Program  (TAP).  AFPC  Airman  and  Family  Sustainment  Branch (AFPC/DPFFF)  provides  operational  oversight  for  the  Transition  Assistance  Program  (TAP).  TAP  participation  is  mandatory  for  all  eligible  separating  Service  members  with  180  days  of active  duty  or  more.    Members  are  required  to  contact  the  installation  Airman  &  Family Readiness Centers (A&FRC) to be scheduled for the TAP.  AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 11 ELIGIBILITY, PLACE OF RETIREMENTAND RESTRICTIONS ON RETIREMENTS Chapter 2 Section 2A—Eligibility 2.1.  Retirement Eligibility. 2.1.1.  Active Duty Retirement Eligibility. Unless granted a waiver under some provision of law, to be eligible for a non-disability active duty retirement, officers and enlisted members of  the  active  or  Reserve  Component  (ANG/AFR),  must  complete  20  years  of  Total  Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS).  Likewise, an officer must have 10 years of Total Active Federal  Commissioned  Service  (TAFCS)  to  receive  an  active  duty  retirement  as  an  officer (10 USC §8911) unless granted a waiver under some provision of law.  Except as specified below,  all  members  must  submit  retirement  applications  for  a  retirement  date  effective  not later than the first day of the month following MSD or HYT. 2.1.1.1.  Officer Eligibility.  Title 10 USC, Chapter 36 or 63 establishes that the AF will retire officers of the Regular Air Force on their MSD if they have 20 years TAFMS and 10  years  TAFCS.    An  officer  who  wishes  to  voluntarily  retire  on  a  date  earlier  than his/her  MSD,  if  eligible,  or  the  first  day  of  the  month  following  his/her  MSD,  must submit a request for retirement. 2.1.1.1.1.  An enlisted member who was subsequently commissioned as an officer at any time and completed 10 years TAFCS is not eligible to retire in that commissioned grade if the member resigned his/her Reserve or Regular commission.   If the member resigned their commission, they will retire in their highest enlisted grade held.  Under the provision of 10 USC §8964, they may be advanced to their highest commissioned grade  held  when  their  active  service  plus  their  service  on  the  retired  list  totals  30 years (see paragraph  7.5). 2.1.1.1.2.  To  voluntarily  retire  in  a  grade  above  major,  a  commissioned  officer generally must have served satisfactorily on active duty  in  that higher  grade with  at least three years’ time in grade (TIG); otherwise the AF will authorize the retirement in  the  next  lower  grade  as  directed  by  10  USC  §1370,  unless  a  waiver  is  granted under some provision of law.  To voluntarily retire in the grade of major or below, a commissioned  officer  must  have  served  on  active  duty  satisfactorily  in  the  higher grade  with  at  least  6  months  TIG.  See  10  USC  §1370(a)  and  Chapter  7  for  a complete explanation. 2.1.1.1.3.  For officers who are subject to mandatory retirement, required under Title 10,  USC,  Chapters  36  or  63,  the  retirement  must  take  place  on  the  date  set  by  the statute  that  applies  (see  Chapter  4).    Officers  who  have  an  MSD  established  must retire  no  later  than  that  date  even  if  previously  approved  for  a  voluntary  retirement effective  after the MSD, unless through  a SecAF  selective continuation process,  the AF  assigns  him/her  a  later  MSD  (see  Chapter  4  for  further  discussion  concerning mandatory retirement dates). 2.1.1.1.4.  Officers may  be involuntarily  extended beyond MSD only with  a view to court-martial (10 USC §639) or for physical disability evaluation (10 USC §640). 12 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 2.1.1.2.  Enlisted  Eligibility.  10  USC  §8914  allows  an  enlisted  member  who  meets  the basic eligibility criteria for retirement, 20 years TAFMS, to request retirement.  Enlisted members who are retirement eligible must apply for retirement, even if they have reached High  Year  of  Tenure  (HYT),  or  else  they  will  be  separated  on  their  Date  of  Separation (DOS) if they have not requested and received approval for a voluntary retirement. 2.1.1.2.1.  If an active component enlisted member desires retirement on the first day of  the  month  following  his/her  HYT  date,  the  member  must  submit  a  retirement application (may not apply to ARC members who qualify for active duty retirement).  The  member’s  DOS  must  fall  on  or  after  the  last  day  of  the  month  prior  to  the requested retirement date. 2.1.1.3.  Sanctuary.    Per  10  USC  §12686(a)  and  §12646(e),  traditional  Air  National Guard  (ANG)  or  Air  Force  Reserve  (AFR)  members,  including  IMAs,  called  to  active duty who have accumulated 18 years of TAFMS may be eligible to continue to 20 years on active duty status unless they waive sanctuary.  If sanctuary is not waived, the member is  accessed  to  active  duty  until  they  reach  20  years  of  TAFMS.  Per  AFI  36-2131, Administration of Sanctuary in the Air Reserve Component, paragraph  4.2.2., sanctuary members  count  against  active  component  end  strength.    A  DOS  will  be  established  to allow  the  member  to  complete  20  years  of  TAFMS.    Members  must  submit  an application for active duty retirement upon completion of 20 years of TAFMS. 2.1.1.4.  Active/Guard  Reserve  (AGR).    Headquarters-assigned  (contract)  ANG  or  AFR (Functional  Category  X)  members  who  qualify  for  and  desire  an  active  duty  retirement upon AGR contract  expiration must submit a retirement application to AFPC or will be returned  to  the  Selected  Reserve.    If  the  AGR  desires  to  retire  earlier  than  contract expiration, the active component orders issuing/publishing authority must approve a tour curtailment  (AFR  reference  AFI  36-2110v2  and  ANGI  36-6  for  ANG).    If  the  member desires  a  retirement  date  later  than  the  contract  expiration,  the  active  component  orders issuing authority may extend the tour to meet the requested retirement date, but approval is  not  guaranteed.    Unit  level  AGRs  who  qualify  for  active  retirement  must  submit applications for retirement to ARPC for approval. 2.1.2.  Reserve Retirement Eligibility.    Title 10 USC §12731 establishes that ANG  or AFR  members must have at least 20 years of creditable years to qualify for a Reserve retirement.  Members  serving  on  active  duty  who  have  completed  20  years  of  creditable  years  through combination  of  active  duty  and  reserve  service  also  qualify  for  a  reserve  retirement  even though they may not have enough Total Active Military Service to qualify for an active duty retirement.  Members must apply for reserve retired pay if they have attained the eligibility age  of  60  and  have  performed  at  least  20  creditable  years.    A  creditable  year  is  defined  as earning 50 points within an individual’s established Retention and Retirement year per AFI 36-2254v1, Reserve Personnel Participation. 2.1.2.1.  A member may start receiving reserve retired pay before age 60 if the member performed  qualifying  active  duty  service  after  January  28,  2008.    The  member  may reduce  the  age  by  three  months  for  each  aggregate  of  90  days  on  which  the  member performs  qualifying  duty  in  any  fiscal  year.    Qualifying  duty  includes  members  who serve on an order to active duty pursuant to 10 USC §12301(d) but does not include AGR AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 13 duty under 10 USC §12310 only.  The minimum age a member may reduce the time to receive pay will not fall below age 50. 2.1.2.2.  Officer Eligibility.  For a voluntary reserve retirement in a grade above major, a commissioned  officer  must  have  served  satisfactorily  in  the  higher  grade  with  at  least three  creditable  years  TIG;  otherwise  the  member  will  retire  in  the  next  lower  grade unless granted a waiver under some provision of law.  For a voluntary reserve retirement in grade of Major or below, a commissioned officer must have served satisfactorily in the higher grade with at least 6 creditable months TIG.  See 10 USC §1370(d) and Chapters 7  and  8  for  a  complete  explanation.    NOTE:    There  is  no  10-year  minimum  TAFCS requirement  for  a  Reserve  non-AGR/active  component  officer  to  receive  a  reserve retirement; only the TIG requirements outlined above apply. 2.1.2.3.  Enlisted  Eligibility.    Participating  Reserve  enlisted  members  that  reach  their HYT date at age 60 and don’t apply for reserve retired pay will automatically be placed in the retired Reserve under the provision of  Title 10 USC, §12108.  Participating ANG enlisted members that reach age 60 can be discharged at their ETS if they don’t apply for reserve retired pay. 2.1.3.  Disability  Retirement  Eligibility.  In  general,  this  applies  to  active  component,  AFR and  ANG  members  on  active  duty  for  more  than  30  days.    Specific  requirements  for eligibility  are  addressed  at  10  USC.  Chapter  61  and  implementing  DoD  and  Air  Force regulations.    For  more  information  on  disability  retirement,  refer  to  AFI  36-3212,  Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation.   2.1.4.  Active Duty Retirement Application Deadlines. 2.1.4.1.  If  no  restrictions  apply  for  active  duty  retirements,  the  application  may  be submitted  up  to  12  months  in  advance  of  the  desired  retirement  date.    Applications submitted  less  than  120  days  in  advance  of  the  desired  retirement  date  must  include justification  for  a  waiver,  as  outlined  in  Table  2.2  and  paragraph  2.8.    NOTE:  Applications  may  be  submitted  outside  this  window  under  the  7-day/3-day  option  or when allowed by the SAF under an approved Force Management program. 2.1.4.2.  If  no  restrictions  apply  for  reserve  component  (AFR/ANG)  retirements,  the application may be submitted up to 12 months, but no less than 180 days, in advance of the desired retirement date. Section 2B—Active Component Members Place of Retirement 2.2.  General Rules. 2.2.1.  A member may retire in: 2.2.1.1.  The  United  States  (US).    This  includes  Alaska,  Hawaii,  or  a  US  territory possession.  Members assigned to a duty station in the US retire at that duty station. 2.2.1.2.  Overseas.    Members  serving  overseas  retire  at  the  overseas  duty  station  (see paragraph    2.3.)  or,  if  approved,  at  a  separation  processing  base  (SPB)  (see  paragraph  2.4.). 14 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 2.2.2.  Do not change the unit of assignment or permanent duty station of members who are within 8 months of retirement without first notifying the RAA.  EXCEPTION:  Assignment approval authority may move members because of unit deactivation, change of unit, or duty station for those who receive notice to start processing for mandatory retirement. 2.3.  Overseas  Duty  Station  . Members serving at an overseas duty station at the time of their retirement may retire at that overseas base to: 2.3.1.  Live permanently in that country.  Prior to the date of retirement, member and family members must obtain the necessary residency permission from the host government. 2.3.2.  Live  temporarily  in  that  country  and  later  move  to  a  final  overseas  or  US  home  of selection  (HOS)  within  the  1-year  time  limit  (JTR,  5068).    Member  and  family  members must  obtain  the  necessary  residency  permission  from  the  host  government  before  the effective date of retirement. 2.3.3.  Move immediately to another overseas site as a final Home of Selection (HOS) by the most  direct  route,  as  determined  by  the  Traffic  Management  Flight  (TMF).    Members  and family  members  must  obtain  the  necessary  residency  permission  from  the  host  government before the effective date of retirement. 2.3.4.  Move directly from the overseas duty station to the final HOS in US.  Member must take  at  least  5  days  of  Permissive  Temporary  Duty  (PTDY)  or  terminal  leave  to  use  this option. 2.3.5.  The  RAA  will  not  issue  “Permanent  Change  of  Station  (PCS)  without  Permanent Change  of  Assignment  (PCA)”  orders  for  members  who  designate  a  home  of  selection elsewhere overseas. 2.3.6.  Travel of Retired Personnel to Overseas HOS.  The RAA will prepare administrative orders for retiring members eligible to establish an overseas HOS. 2.4.  Separation Processing Base (SPB).  Unless the appropriate RAA grants travel to a SPB, a member  assigned  overseas  will  complete  processing  at  the  overseas  location.    The  AF  defines SPB as the Air Force base in the US with a MPS and Financial Services Office (FSO) nearest to the member’s projected HOS or terminal leave address. 2.4.1.  The RAA assigns the member “PCS without PCA” to the unit of the host MPS. 2.4.2.  Members retiring  at  the SPB have one  year from  the retirement date to  make a final HOS move from the area of the SPB to anywhere in the US. 2.4.3.  Members  not  authorized  HOS  allowances  may  receive  travel  and  transportation allowances  from  their last  base to  the place they actually travel,  with  reimbursement not  to exceed the cost of returning to their Home of Record (HOR) or the Place they Last Entered into Active Duty (PLEAD). 2.4.4.  Specific  procedures  relating  to  SPB  are  found  in  the  on-line  SPB  guide.    See  AFPC website for more information. 2.5.  Travel  and  Transportation  Entitlements  for  Overseas  Retirees  .    The  JTR  outlines separate travel pay entitlements for the member and for family members.  The TMF helps clarify which travel entitlements pertain to the member and which pertain to his/her family members. AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 15 2.6.  Leave in Conjunction with Retirement  .  The member must obtain approval from his/her commander for PTDY and terminal leave (T-3).  Members may not depart on terminal leave or PTDY  until  receipt  of  retirement  orders  (see  AFI  36-3003,  Military  Leave  Program,  for  more information on PTDY and terminal leave). 2.6.1.  Personnel  granted  terminal  leave  or  PTDY  in  connection  with  retirement  remain assigned to their units.  The inclusive dates of terminal leave and PTDY do not require a tour curtailment.    When  a  commander  authorizes  PTDY  and  terminal  leave  dates  prior  to  a member’s  DEROS,  he/she  cannot  use  the  departure  as  basis  for  an  earlier  assignment  of  a replacement. Section 2C—Retirement Prohibitions and Waiverable Restrictions 2.7.  General  Information  on  Retirement  Prohibitions  and  Restrictions  .    A  number  of conditions  can  temporarily  prohibit/suspend  or  otherwise  restrict  processing  of  applications  for active  duty  retirement  and  applications  for  transfer  to  the  retired  reserve  (hereafter  Section  2C will use “retirement application” to generally refer to both applications for active duty retirement and transfer to the retired reserve, unless otherwise specified).  Table 2.1 lists conditions which prohibit initial  submission  or  suspend  processing  of  previously  submitted  retirement applications.    The  table  explains  how  the  condition  prohibits  or  suspends  processing  of  the retirement  action.    If  the  condition  in  Table  2.1  ceases  to  apply,  normal  processing  generally resumes.    Table  2.2  contains  waiverable  restrictions  on  retirement.    When  such  a  restriction applies,  the  retirement  application  is  processed  IAW  Table  2.2  to  the  RAA  with  delegated authority  to  approve  or  deny  the  retirement  application  while  under  that  restriction.    Certain restrictions, as identified in  Table  2.2, require consideration by the SAF Personnel  Council for recommendation  to  the  appropriate  RAA  at  the  Secretariat-level.    When  applicable  eligibility requirements  (see  Chapter  3)  are  met,  retirement  applications  may  only  be  denied  by  RAAs outside  the  Secretariat  when  done  so  in  accordance  with  a  regulatory  prohibition/restriction  on retirement. 2.8.  Waiver  of  Restrictions  .    Members  must  request  a  waiver  if  they  have  retirement restrictions listed in Table 2.2.  If members need waivers of Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC), Reserve Service Commitment (RSC) or any other restrictions, they must attach written justification/documentation to their retirement applications.  Prohibitions in Table 2.1 will not be waived. 2.8.1.  If  the  member  requests  a  waiver  of  a  retirement  restriction,  the  commander  or Program  Manager,  if  applicable  to  IMAs,  must  make  a  recommendation  for  approval  or disapproval  of  the  retirement  application  (T-2).    The  commander’s/Program  Manager’s recommendation  does  not  by  itself,  constitute  justification.  Absent  a  written  delegation  of Secretarial  authority  to  approve  the  restricted  retirement,  commanders/Program  Managers generally do not have the authority to waive restrictions on retirement, including ADSCs or RSCs. 2.8.2.  The  member  may  request  a  waiver  of  the  restrictions  listed  in  Table  2.2  under hardship  or  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Air  Force  as  specified  in  the  pertinent  rule.    If  the member  believes  the  Air  Force  assigned  an  ADSC  or  RSC  in  error,  the  RAA  or  agency managing  the  member’s  retirement  application  reports  the  discrepancy  to  the  proper  office and  ensures  the  POC  corrects  the  service  commitment,  if  applicable.    Members  must  not 16 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 make  any  irrevocable  financial  commitments  on  the  assumption  that  their  waiver  requests will  be  approved.    Members  cannot  later  use  problems  resulting  from  premature commitments as a basis for hardship waiver requests. 2.8.2.1.  Waiver  Requests  Based  on  Hardship  (see  Attachment  1,  Terms).  Applicants must explain, in writing, and provide detailed documentation to show the hardship, how retirement  will  ease  or  eliminate  the  hardship,  and  how  the  hardship  condition  arose  or worsened after the service commitment or restriction occurred and what other efforts the member  took  to  remedy  the  situation,  other  than  requesting  a  change  to  the  retirement date  (such  as  a  request  for  humanitarian  reassignment,  join  spouse,  etc.).    A  hardship situation cannot be common to other military members in the course of a military career.  The  Air  Force  recognizes  timing  of  civilian  employment,  business  opportunities,  plans for  higher  education  or  training,  ownership  of  property,  family  separation,  and  other inconveniences  as  common  situations  and  will  not  approve  waiver  requests  for  these reasons alone. 2.8.2.2.  Waiver  Requests  Based  on  Best  Interest  of  the  Air  Force  (see  Attachment 1). An application citing “best interest of the Air Force” as a basis for a waiver must clearly  show  how  retirement  would  serve  Air  Force  interests.    Members  and commanders  should  not  use  “best  interest  of  the  Air  Force”  as  a  basis  for  a  waiver when  an  administrative  or  punitive  action  may  be  warranted  or  more  appropriate. Further,  waivers  submitted  for  common  situations  such  as  those  mentioned  in paragraph   2.8.2.1, or based solely on manning or to save the Air Force money will not be considered. 2.8.2.3.  Waiver Not Required in Certain Cases. The appropriate RAA may approve some applications  without  waivers.    When  a  member’s  record  indicates  the  member’s retirement date coincides with an involuntary DOS or ETS, or upon an enlisted member reaching HYT the RAA can disregard the unfulfilled service commitment. 2.8.3.  (AF Reserve Only)  Voluntary retirement applications for Traditional Reservists and IMAs  must  be  submitted  to  ARPC  6  months  prior  to  the  requested  retirement  date.    The authority to approve waivers of the 6-month requirement is ARPC but must be recommended for  approval  by  the  Wing  Commander  or  equivalent  for  the  unit  program  and  Program Manager for the IMA program. 2.8.4.  (ANG  Only)  .    Voluntary  retirement  applications  must  be  submitted  to  ARPC  6 months  prior  to  the  requested  retirement  date.    The  authority  to  approve  waivers  of  the  6-month  requirement  is  ARPC  but  must  be  recommended  for  approval  by  the  Wing Commander or equivalent. 2.9.  Assignment/365-day  Extended  Deployment  Declination  or  7-Day/3-Day  Option (7DO/3DO)  .  The  member  must  submit  a  request  for  retirement  eligibility  review  within  the 7DO/3DO period, as appropriate, to be considered for retirement under these programs.  Refer to AFI  36-2110,  Assignments,  for  guidance  on  the  7DO/3DO  program.    Refer  to  paragraph  3.1.1.1.4 for declining to obtain required retainability if selected for a contingency deployment.   AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 17 2.10.   Retirement  in  Conjunction  with  High-Year-Tenure  (HYT)  Date  (Does  not  apply  to ANG).  Members must request voluntary retirements to be effective no later than the first day of the month following the HYT date.  In accordance with law (10 USC §8914 and §8917), enlisted members  must  voluntarily  request  retirement.    If  an  enlisted  member  does  not  submit  a retirement application before his/her DOS, that member will separate.  If the separation occurs, the  enlisted  member  must  submit  a  request  to  the  Board  of  Correction  to  Military  Records (BCMR)  to  request  a  change  from  separation  to  retirement,  which  will  significantly  delay entitlements.    An  ADSC  expiring  after  an  enlisted  member’s  established  HYT  month  will  be automatically waived when the member requests to retire the month following HYT.  The HYT is set at the following service points: Senior Airmen (SrA) at 8 years of service; Staff Sergeant (SSgt) at 15 years of service; Technical Sergeant (TSgt) at 20 years of service; Master Sergeant (MSgt) at 24 years of service; Senior Master Sergeant (SMSgt) at 26 years of service; and Chief Master  Sergeant  (CMSgt)  at  30  years  of  service  (for  CMSgt,  see  paragraph  2.10.1.5.).  EXCEPTIONS:    Enlisted  members  who  are  approved  for  HYT  extension  for  hardship  or  best interest of the Air Force reason(s) may serve until completion of their approved extension period.  Members  who  accept  a  Critical  Skills  Retention  Bonus  (CSRB)  will  have  their  HYT  adjusted IAW CSRB program guidance.  2.10.1.  HYT  Extensions.    The  Air  Force  rarely  extends  HYT  dates,  and  a  member  should submit requests only when experiencing an extreme hardship not common to contemporaries or when an extension serves the best interest of the Air Force.  The Air Force designed the HYT policy to manage the size of the career force and to induce a reasonable promotion flow to all grades.  The HYT for SrA through CMSgt establishes a balance between the need for experience  and  youth  in  the  enlisted  force.    The  Retirements  Personnel  Services  Delivery Guide  is  located  in  myPers  on  the  AFPC  website  and  contains  specific  procedures  for submitting HYT extension requests. 2.10.1.1.  Justification  for  a  waiver  to  extend  HYT  must  clearly  show  how  the extension  serves  the  best  interest  of  the  Air  Force  or  how  the  applicant  is experiencing an extreme hardship not normally incurred by contemporaries. Members will  submit  HYT  waivers  to  the  RAA  using  the  procedures  outlined  in  the  on-line guide.  Members who receive approval for an extension of their HYT must be able to obtain the necessary retainability associated with the promotion in order to be eligible for  promotion  consideration;  however,  HYT  extensions  are  not  approved  simply  to provide additional opportunities for promotion consideration or to await the outcome of  applications  for  corrections  of  record  or  supplemental/special  promotion  board consideration. 2.10.1.2.  Extension  of  HYT  Based  on  Hardship.    The  same  conditions  found  in paragraph    2.8.2.1  regarding  hardship  waivers  apply  to  requests  for  extension  of  a HYT  based  on  extreme  hardship  not  common  to  contemporaries.    Members  submit the  fully  justified  request  to  AFPC  containing  unit  and  wing  commander  (or equivalent) recommendation with wet or digital signatures.  The maximum extension period is  1  year.  Multiple extension approvals  or requests to  extend for  a period of more than 1 year will not normally be entertained. 18 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 2.10.1.3.  Extension of HYT Based on Best  Interest of the Air Force (BIOAF).  The same  conditions  found  in  paragraph    2.8.2.2  regarding  BIOAF  waivers  apply  to requests for HYT  extensions  based on the best  interest  of the Air Force.  Normally, members make these requests when a commander finds a uniquely qualified Airman, filling  a  critical  position,  essential  to  the  success  of  a  vital  mission  and  AFPC  can provide no suitable replacement.  Members submit the fully justified request to AFPC (containing unit and wing commander recommendation with wet or digital signatures) no earlier than 1 year and not later than 6 months before the individual’s HYT.  The maximum  extension  period  is  1  year.    Multiple  extension  approvals  or  requests  to extend for a period of more than 1 year will not normally be entertained. 2.10.1.4.  Extension  to  a  HYT  Date  Due  to  Temporary  Suspension  of  Retirement Processing.  If the AFPC Medical Standards Branch places a member approaching a HYT  on  medical  hold,  or  an  authorized  agency  notified  the  RAA  to  temporarily suspend  a  retirement  due  to  a  restriction  identified  in  Table  2.1  or  Table  2.2,  the RAA  will  adjust  the  HYT  in  order  for  the  member  to  voluntarily  extend  his/her enlistment.  The member’s unit commander or the wing’s Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) will  notify  the  RAA  to  extend  a  HYT  for  completion  of  a  disciplinary  action, allowing  the  member  to  voluntarily  extend  to  await  outcome  of  disciplinary  actions (T-0).    Enlisted  members  who  refuse  to  remain  on  active  duty  for  MEB/PEB processing  must  provide  documentation  of  their  waiver  of  Disability  Evaluation processing when applying for voluntary retirement.   The member’s unit commander or the wing’s SJA may involuntarily retain an enlisted member on active duty in view of trial by court-martial. 2.10.1.5.  The  Chief’s  Group  (AF/DPE)  will  field  inquiries  specifically  pertaining  to CMSgt  HYTs and HYT  extension requests.  Members may initiate and submit  requests for  HYT  extensions,  based  on  hardship  or  when  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Air  Force.  Normally  a  commander  only  supports  a  request  for  a  uniquely  qualified  Chief  Master Sergeant, filling a critical position, essential to the success of a vital mission and AFPC can  provide  no  suitable  replacement.    The  Wing  or  comparable  level  commander  must support  the  request  and  show  that  member’s  retention  is  essential  to  the  success  of  the mission  (T-2).  Members  submit  the  fully  justified  request  to  AF/DPE  (containing  unit and wing commander recommendation) no earlier than 1 year and not later than 6 months before the individual’s HYT.  NOTE:  Requests for HYT extension based on a hardship may be submitted within 12 months of the individual’s HYT.  The maximum extension period is 1 year. Multiple extension approvals or requests to extend for a period of more than 1 year will not normally be entertained 2.10.2.  HYT  of  Demoted  Members  (Not  applicable  to  AFR).    Individuals  demoted  to  a lower grade are subject to the HYT of the lower grade (see paragraph  2.10). 2.10.2.1.  After a member is promoted to TSgt (E-6), their HYT is established at 20 years of  service.    If  a  demoted  member  has  16  or  more  years  TAFMS,  the  AF  considers him/her as length-of-service qualified so his/her HYT will remain or be set at 20 years of service.  If a TSgt or higher subsequently experiences a reduction in rank to E-5 or below and  has  less  than  16  years  TAFMS,  the  HYT  will  be  established  IAW  AFI  36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen. AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 19 2.10.2.2.  The AF will allow those demoted members who have not yet reached the HYT for their lower grade to remain in the active component until they reach the HYT for their lower grade.  If a member’s DOS/ETS exceeds the newly established HYT, the AF will adjust the DOS/ETS to coincide with the new HYT point.  2.10.2.3.  The AF will set the HYT for demoted members who exceed the HYT for their lower grade and are otherwise retirement eligible as the last day of the 6th month after the date  of  demotion  in  order  to  retire  no  later  than  the  first  day  of  the  7th  month  after  the effective date of demotion.  Members must request retirement or they will be separated. 2.10.2.4.  Individuals  assigned  overseas  who  are  otherwise  eligible  to  retire,  and  are demoted  and  exceed  the  HYT  for  their  lower  grade,  will  be  required  to  serve  until reaching their Date Eligible to Return from Overseas (DEROS). 2.10.2.5.  A  member  under  the  High-36  retired  pay  plan  (or  REDUX)  who  is  demoted within  3  years  of  the  retirement  date  and  doesn’t  regain  the  highest  grade  held  will receive retired pay under the Final Basic Pay retired pay plan at the lower grade (10 USC §1407(f)).  A member demoted to a lower grade more than 3 years prior to retirement and doesn’t  regain  the  highest  grade  held  will  receive  retired  pay  under  the  High-36  retired pay plan at the lower grade. 2.11.  Request for Withdrawal or Change of Month.  When a member completes and submits a  retirement  application,  the  member  cannot  withdraw  the  application  or  change  the  approved retirement  date  unless  he/she  provides  strong  justification  under  the  following  reasons:  severe hardship  not  common  to  Air  Force  members;  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Air  Force;  accept continuation; or to accept an active component promotion that requires the member to serve past the  requested  or  approved  retirement  date.    The  SAF  Personnel  Council  has  re-delegated authority to designated Special Assistants, as outlined in paragraph  1.5, to approve requests for withdrawal  or  change.    The  RAA  usually  will  not  approve  a  withdrawal  or  adjustment  if  the member volunteered to retire under the 7DO/3DO program. 2.11.1.  Requests  for  Withdrawal  or  Change  of  Retirement  Date  Based  on  Hardship.    The same conditions found in paragraph  2.8.2.1 regarding hardship waivers apply to waivers for withdrawal or change of retirement.  The commander or other senior official in the member’s chain  of command must recommend  approval  of the request  (T-2). Unless the member and his/her leadership adequately document the above reasons, they should not expect approval. 2.11.2.  Request  for  Withdrawal  or  Change  Based  on  BIOAF.    The  same  conditions found in paragraph  2.8.2.2 regarding waivers for BIOAF apply to waivers for withdrawal or  change  of  retirement.    The  member  and  commander  or  other  senior  official  in  the member’s chain of command must provide evidence that clearly shows the withdrawal or change  serves  Air  Force  interests  (T-2).    If  the  commander  recommends  disapproval, reasons must be given to support that recommendation. 2.11.3.  Request for Withdrawal or Change Based on Promotion. The RAA may approve this request  if  the  AF  selected  the  member  after  he/she  applied  for  retirement.    Members  must submit  requests  for  withdrawal  within  10  duty  days  of  promotion  notification.  Enlisted Airmen  who  elect  retirement  under  7DO/3DO  provisions  are  not  eligible  for  promotion.  20 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 Enlisted  Airmen  selected  for  promotion  before  they  submit  a  retirement  application  under 7DO/3DO may not withdraw the retirement to accept promotion. 2.11.3.1.  For  members  selected  for  promotion  to  MSgt,  SMSgt,  or  CMSgt.    Upon accepting the promotion, the member must sign a Promotion Statement of Understanding (PSU)  and  agree  to  obtain  retainability  for  the  promotion  ADSC.        The  member  must also submit an application to request approval to withdraw the retirement. 2.11.3.2.  Members  selected  for  promotion  to  SSgt  or  TSgt  do  not  incur  an  ADSC  for promotion.    The  member  submits  a  request  to  withdraw  or  change  the  effective  date  of retirement based on promotion. 2.11.4.  Request for Withdrawal or Date Change for Medical Reasons.   A member may not request withdrawal or date change to stay on active duty solely to resolve a medical problem or  receive  medical  treatment.    If  the  local  medical  facility  deems  the  member’s  medical problems  severe  enough  to  warrant  a  change  of  retirement  date,  the  facility  POC  uses  the medical hold procedures detailed in the PSD Guide. 2.12.  Request  for  Extension  Beyond  a  Date  of  Separation  (DOS),  Expiration  Term  of Service  (ETS;  enlisted  only),  or  Mandatory  Separation  Date  (MSD;  officers  only).  With direction from the unit commander or SJA, the RAA may hold an enlisted member past his/her DOS/ETS  in  view  of  trial  by  court-martial.    Enlisted  members  must  agree  to  hold  actions initiated  by  the  AFPC  Medical  Standards  Branch  for  medical  treatment,  and  must  voluntarily extend  their  enlistment  to  be  retained  for  medical  evaluation  and  treatment.    The  SecAF  or designee  may  delay  an  officer’s  retirement  to  complete  actions  with  a  view  to  trial  by  court-martial  (10  USC  §639)  or  to  complete  a  medical  evaluation  (10  USC  §640  and  paragraph  4.2.3.). 2.13.  Application  of  Medal  of  Honor  Recipient  .  Even when conditions or restrictions exist under  Tables  2.1  or  Table  2.2,  which  normally  prohibit  or  restrict  processing,  the  RAA  will process  a  retirement  application  submitted  by  a  member  awarded  the  Medal  of  Honor.    Final action will be taken by the RAA at the appropriate level if any prohibitions or restrictions apply. 2.14.  Retired  Members  Ordered  to  Active  Duty  .  The  SecAF  may  determine  a  valid  Air Force requirement exists and order retired members of the Active Component or of the Retired Reserve  (retired  under  10  USC  §1293,  §3911,  §3914,  §6323,  §8911  or  §8914),  back  to  active duty (under 10 USC §688) at any time.  The period of recall may not exceed 12 months within the  first  24  months  following  date  of  recall.    EXCEPTION:  Chaplains,  health  professionals, officers  serving  with  the  American  Battle  Monuments  Commission,  and  Defense  or  Service Attachés may serve for periods longer than 12 months.  The SecAF will not recall officers retired by  selective  early  retirement  board  (SERB)  under  10  USC  §638  or  Enhanced  Selective  Early Retirement Board (ESERB) under 10 USC §638a.  Additionally, SecAF will not recall officers who  requested  retirement  after  notification  that  the  Air  Force  would  consider  them  for  early retirement under 10 USC §638 or 10 USC §638a but before that board considered their records.  Congress or the President during a time of war or national emergency (10 USC §688) can choose to recall these two categories of officers.   AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 21 Table 2.1.  Conditions Prohibiting Initial Submission or Suspending Processing of Previously Submitted Retirement Applications. RULE  A  If member  B  then  1.a.  Is under civil or military investigation (See Note 1) 1.b. 1.c. Is under civil or military charges that, in case of conviction, may result in initiation of an administrative discharge action (See Note 1) Has been offered Nonjudicial Punishment under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)  The member is not eligible to apply for voluntary retirement.  If an application has already been submitted or a retirement has been approved prior to initiation of an investigation, the member’s commander (or Program Manager for ARC) or the wing’s SJA will immediately direct the RAA to place the retirement in suspension.  Commanders or SJAs will follow verbal notification with a written request to place an administrative hold flag on the member’s retirement under this regulation (T-0).  The RAA will place the member on administrative hold which, if applicable, rescinds the previously published retirement order until the Air Force completes the investigation and the Air Force completes all actions resulting from the investigation (Table 2.2).  After completing all investigations and all actions resulting from the investigations, the member’s commander or the wing’s SJA notifies the RAA that all actions are complete and the RAA will return to normal application processing (see Note 4).  If, after completing all investigations, the member’s commander decides not to take any further actions, the member’s commander or the wing’s SJA notifies the RAA of the commander’s decision and the RAA will return to normal application processing (see Note 4) (T-0).  Apply guidance from 1.a., above, when the nature of the charges may warrant action resulting in a restriction under Table 2.2. The RAA does not process the application until the Article 15, UCMJ action has been found legally sufficient. When a member requests a retirement date earlier than punishment completion date, the RAA must inform the commander that, if the commander signs the 22 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 application and does not recommend retirement at a later date to coincide with completion of punishment, the earlier retirement date will probably be approved and, if so, any remaining punishment will be remitted. If the commander recommending retirement is not a commander authorized to remit the Article 15 punishment, the recommendation of the commander who imposed punishment must indicate that punishment was or will be remitted by the requested retirement date. The RAA does not process the application until action has been taken on the sentence by the court-martial convening authority.  When requested retirement date is earlier than punishment completion date, the retirement date may be delayed.  An approved retirement does not preclude completion of a sentence to confinement.  If the court-martial convening authority removes the prohibition by commuting or remitting the sentence, normal processing of the retirement application resumes.  If the convening authority suspends the sentence, see Table 2.2, Rule 14. The RAA will place the application or retirement in suspension until SAF PC completes review of the OGD and the appropriate authority has made the final grade determination.  The RAA will process the OGD following procedures in Chapter 7, paragraph 7.6 (see Note 2).  Members not eligible to apply for retirement under the 7DO/3DO programs must proceed on the PCS or deployment. If a hardship condition exists prior to departure, member may apply for waiver of the 7DO/3DO program to SAFPC.  After arrival at the new duty station, members become subject to any other restrictions existing at that time, but may submit an application for retirement once eligible (see Note 3).   enlisted and has retainability for the deployment plus 30 days, or if an officer and has remaining service commitment that would allow them to complete the deployment plus 30 days.  If a hardship condition exists, member may apply for retirement or transfer to the retired reserve (see Is subject to an Officer Grade Determination (OGD) initiated by any commander or other authorized official  Applies for retirement on or after assignment selection date (ASD) or notification of 365-day extended deployment and is not eligible to apply under  the 7-day option/3-day option (7DO/3DO) program or applies under 7DO/3DO for an unauthorized date  Is officially tasked to deploy   Member is ineligible to apply for retirement if 1.d.

Members who are found fit for continued service may then apply for retirement.  (See Notes 5 and 6) *NOTES:   *1.  The SecAF or designee may suspend retirement of Active Component officers and certain Reserve officers projected to retire on their MSD (see Chapter 4, Table 4.1.) in accordance with procedures  shown  in  10  USC  §639  (action  in  view  to  court-martial),  10  USC  §640  (medical action in view to disability retirement), or 10 USC §123 or §12305 (Stop Loss).  The conditions in this table will not  prohibit or suspend mandatory  retirements  beyond  MSD unless statutory conditions are met.  See paragraph 2.10 for guidance on enlisted members who have requested to retire based on HYT.  2.    In  the  case  of  an  officer’s  mandatory  retirement,  any  person  in  the  member’s  chain  of command may initiate an OGD no earlier than 12 months prior to the mandatory retirement or any day thereafter.  Processing of an OGD will not, however, suspend the mandatory retirement date of an Active Component officer or of certain Reserve officers.  3.  Paragraph 2.8 shows how to apply for retirement under hardship conditions.  *4.    If  the  retirement  was  suspended,  contact  the  commander  and  member  for  a  desired retirement date upon release from administrative hold.  If the original retirement date passed, or doesn’t  allow  use  of  PTDY/terminal  leave,  retirement  should  be  effective  as  soon  as  possible after release from administrative hold; however, the RAA may adjust the date further provided the commander is authorizing use of PTDY/terminal leave.  5.  Enlisted members with insufficient service retainability for MEB/PEB processing must voluntarily extend their enlistments for medical hold.  Medical hold is a method of retaining a service member beyond an established retirement or separation date for reason of disability processing IAW AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force and AFI 41-210, TRICARE Operations and Patient Administration Functions. Enlisted members who are within 6 months of their Date of Separation and refuse to remain on active duty for MEB/PEB processing must provide documentation of their waiver of Disability Evaluation processing when applying for voluntary retirement   6.  Officers remain on active duty until the determination of service fitness is finalized.  Those officers with a Mandatory Separation Date will be retained for MEB/PEB processing IAW 10 USC §640 and paragraph 4.2.3. 24 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 Table 2.2.

A  member  who  cannot  serve  as  specified  by  reason  of  a  mandatory  DOS  must  request  a retirement date effective the first day of DOS month, or if the mandatory DOS is the last day of the month, the member must request  a retirement effective date the first day of the month following the mandatory DOS.  28 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 2.  The RAA will not approve a retirement effective date extension to allow the member to take PTDY or terminal leave.   3.  Officers in grades above major wishing to voluntarily retire in their officer grade must serve three years TIG or retire in the next lower grade as directed by 10 USC §1370(a) for active duty retirements and  10  USC  §1370(d)  for  reserve  retirements.    (The  three  year  TIG  requirement  does  not  apply  to involuntary  active  duty  retirements  IAW  10  USC  §1370(a)(3);  see  paragraph  7.2  and  the  statute  for other  possible  exceptions.)    The  AF  rarely  waives  TIG.  An  officer  who  cannot  justify  waiver  of  the TIG  requirement,  or  whose  waiver  request  the  AF  disapproves,  may  ask  to  retire  in  the  next  lower grade held satisfactorily for at least 6 months TIG. See Chapters 7 and 8.  4.  An officer assigned to a Critical Acquisition Position (CAP) requires a waiver for service obligation (10 USC §1734). Only SAF/AQ or the designated representative has approval authority to waive a CAP ADSC.  CAP officers do not use Table 2.2.  To request a waiver, the officer completes a DD Form 2588, Acquisition Corps Waiver Request, Department of Defense, obtains the supervisor’s or commander’s signature, then submits it to SAF/AQ or designated representative for processing.  Once SAF/AQ or designated representative approves the officer’s waiver request, the officer may apply for retirement.   5.  Waiver of an ADSC or RSC for AAD, ARP, JACP, CSRB, other continuation pays or bonuses, tuition assistance or any other ADSC for which a member receives a special pay incentive does not waive recoupment for those pays, assistance or bonuses.  Recoupment for certain pays, assistance and bonuses may be waived by SecAF under an existing Force Management program.   6.  See the applicable AFI for allowable retirement date and specific processing procedures.  In certain circumstances, members may make discretionary requests to retire in lieu of an adverse action—such a  request  is  treated  as  a  request  to  waive  the  applicable  restriction  on  retirement.  With  respect  to demotion  actions:  members  applying  for  retirement  in  lieu  of  demotion  (AFI  36-2502  action)  will either be approved for retirement in grade or disapproved for retirement in lieu of demotion (at which time,  demotion  action  may  take  place).    With  respect  to  discharge  actions,  in  some  circumstances, active duty and reserve officers and enlisted members are entitled to retirement or retired pay in spite of a discharge action.  See 10 USC §1186 (active duty officer) and 10 USC §14905 (reserve officer) and Chapter 8 provisions regarding Former Members entitled to reserve retired pay.  See also Note 18 regarding separation and drop from the rolls actions based on civilian convictions.  *7.  An enlisted member pending discharge action who has at least 16 but less than 20 years TAFMS may  request  retention  on  active  duty  to  reach  retirement  eligibility.    If  approved,  the  Secretary  or designated authority may defer discharge action to allow the enlisted member to retire on the first day of  the  month  after  the  month  in  which  the  member  completes  20  years  TAFMS.    The  AF  calls  this procedure “length-of-service consideration.”  See AFI 36-3208 for further guidance.    8.  If a member has applied for retirement and a restriction applies at time of application, the member’s commander or local SJA officer immediately notifies the RAA to suspend retirement processing (T-0).  If a member has an approved retirement and, prior to the effective date of retirement, a restriction applies, member’s commander or local SJA officer immediately notifies the RAA to suspend the retirement and follows with a written request for an administrative hold under this AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 29 instruction (T-0).  In these instances, the RAA will suspend the retirement. In either case, the instructions under the applicable rule in this table then apply.   9.  In the absence of a waiver request, a restriction ends upon termination of administrative action not resulting in discharge.  *10.  At the time of application, members must be retirement-eligible, i.e., have completed at least 20 years Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS) and, for officers, at least 10 years Total Active Federal  Commissioned Service (TAFCS).  Officers with  20  years TAFMS who have completed less than 10 years TAFCS may apply for separation for the purpose of enlisting and retiring in an enlisted grade.  See paragraph 3.6.    11.    The  discharge  board  convening  authority  will  review  the  request  and  may  elect  to  suspend discharge processing to allow SAF review.  If the convening authority elects to complete the discharge board  prior  to  SAF  review,  the  discharge  will  not  be  finalized  until  the  SAF  makes  a  decision regarding the retirement request.  Note: The administrative discharge of any member who is otherwise eligible for retirement under any provision of law requires approval of SecAF or his designee.  12.  Refer to the Retirements PSD guide for specific processing instructions.  *13.    The  General  Courts-Martial  convening  authority  (GCMCA)  will  review  the  request  for retirement  before  trial.    When  the  GCMCA  recommends  retirement  before  trial,  the  request  will  be sent to SAF for review and action.   If the GCMCA does not recommend retirement before trial, and the member is enlisted, the application is held in abeyance until the trial is completed.  If the member is  an  officer,  the  GCMCA  may  deny  the  application  if  charges  have  not  been  referred.    Officer applications submitted after referral  of charges shall be sent  to SAF for review and action.  Officers may later re-submit applications that were previously denied by the GCMCA before referral.    If the charges  are  withdrawn  or  dismissed,  or  the  accused  is  acquitted,  normal  retirement  processing continues.  If the member is sentenced, application is processed under Rule 5.  See also AFI 36-3208, AFI 36-3206 and AFI 51-201 for further guidance.    14.  Application may be submitted once the appellate review process is finalized and the decision is made to uphold the discharge or dismissal action.   15.  Officers requesting retirement in lieu of adverse action are subject to an Officer Grade Determination (OGD).  See paragraph 7.6 for more information on the OGD process.   16.  Pertains to members who apply for retirement before ASD.  AFI 36-2110 provides guidance on 7DO/3DO rules and requesting extensions and curtailments of stabilized tours and DEROS. This does not apply to members of the ARC.   17.  Members completing a CONUS maximum stabilized tour, within 12 months of reaching retirement eligibility, refer to AFI 36-2110.  This does not apply to members of the ARC.     30 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 18.    AFI  36-3206  and  AFI  36-3208  provide  guidance  on  involuntary  separation  based  on  civilian conviction,  to  include  criteria  for  drop  from  the  rolls  actions  based  on  lengthy  confinement.  Commanders should seek legal advice on whether a specific drop from the rolls action affects active duty  or  reserve  retired  pay.    Note  that  espionage-type  convictions  covered  by  the  Hiss  Act,  5  USC Chapter 83, may cause an automatic forfeiture of retired pay.  19.  When Rule 1.a. and 1.b. TIG waivers are employed by the Air Force as a force management tool, eligibility and processing criteria will be in accordance with the applicable force management guidance administered by AF/A1 or AF/RE, respectively.  In the absence of force management guidance, Rule 1.a. and 1.b. TIG waivers shall be processed for SAF Personnel Council consideration, under a “best interest of the Air Force” standard. AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 31 Chapter 3 VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT IN OFFICER OR ENLISTED STATUS 3.1.  Voluntary  Authority  .  Table  3.1  shows  the  section  of  law,  as  well  as  the  conditions  of eligibility  and  approval,  relating  to  application  for  voluntary  active  and  reserve  component retirement.    To  meet  these  eligibility  conditions  for  voluntary  active  component  retirement,  a member, active or RC, must have completed at least 20 years of active military service as of the effective date of the request.  To retire in an officer grade, the active component member must serve  at  least  10  of  the  minimum  20  years  of  active  service  as  active  commissioned  service. When allowed by law, the SecAF may elect to waive TAFCS to 8 years under an existing Force Management  program.  Unless  a  member  receives  a  waiver  or  the  RAA  authorizes  him/her  to retire in  a higher  grade  (paragraphs    7.2. and   7.3.), the member must meet  the applicable TIG requirements  shown  in  Table  2.2  and  Chapter  7.    To  meet  these  eligibility  conditions  for voluntary  reserve  component  retirement,  a  member  must  have  completed  at  least  20  years  of creditable  military  service  as  of  the  effective  date  of  the  request.    Reserve  component  officers must also meet time in grade requirements or retire in the next highest grade held satisfactorily. 3.1.1.  Absent a special law or agreement, an officer has no legal right to retire whenever he or she wishes.  Establishment of an ADSC does not create a right or entitlement to retire from the  Air  Force  upon  completion  of  the  ADSC.    RegAF  officers  usually  serve  on  indefinite active-duty tours by appointment of the President and must request release from active duty or discharge in order to separate.  Consideration of an officer’s request for retirement is based on the needs of the Air Force, which may require the officer’s continued service beyond the completion of an ADSC. 3.1.1.1.  For active component members, the requested DOS must be: 3.1.1.1.1.  If assigned to the Continental United States (CONUS) (not on a stabilized or maximum tour), on or after the latest ADSC and no earlier than 4 months from the date of the application, and no later than MSD/last day of HYT month.  The member may request a waiver (with justification) to obtain a DOS earlier than 4 months from the date of application. 3.1.1.1.2.  If  serving  overseas  and  otherwise  eligible,  on  completion  of  the  latest ADSC  date.    If  the  ADSC  ends  within  12  months  after  the  date  eligible  for  return from overseas (DEROS), the DOS must fall no earlier than 12 months after DEROS. 3.1.1.1.3.  If  serving  on  CONUS  maximum  stabilized  tour,  on  or  before  the  tour completion date. 3.1.1.1.4.  If  selected  for  a  contingency  (AEF)  deployment  (Note:    for  365-day extended deployments, see Table 2.1, rule 3, and AFI 36-2110): 3.1.1.1.4.1.  If  an  officer  is  selected  for  contingency  deployment  and  has  a service commitment that expires at least 30 days after the deployment return date, the officer is required to complete the deployment; however, the officer may  request  retirement  if  a  hardship  condition  exists  (see  paragraph    2.8).  Although members may request a SecAF waiver, a retirement request for the sole purpose of avoiding deployment will not usually be considered. 32 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 3.1.1.1.4.2.  If an enlisted member is selected for contingency deployment and has sufficient retainability to deploy with 30 days upon return from their deployment prior  to  their  DOS,  they  will  be  required  to  deploy.    Although  members  may request  a  SecAF  waiver,  a  retirement  request  for  the  sole  purpose  of  avoiding deployment will not usually be considered. the  necessary  retainability 3.1.1.1.4.3.  If  an  enlisted  member  is  selected  for  contingency  deployment  but does  not  have the  deployment, commanders  will  determine  the  individual’s  intent  to  obtain service  retainability for  the  contingency  deployment  (T-2).    For  Airmen  who  do  not  have  the retainability  to  deploy  and  do  not  want  to  obtain  it,  refer  to  AFI  36-2110, Assignments,  and  AFI  36-2606,  Reenlistment  in  the  United  States  Air  Force. Retainability intentions must be documented on AF Form 964 no later than 3 duty days  after  official  deployment  notification.  Upon required documentation, the Installation Personnel Readiness office will update assignment availability  code  09  and  reenlistment  eligibility  code  “3D”  into  MilPDS  and forward  the  AF  Form  964  to  AFPC  for  filing  in  the  members  master  personnel record. to  complete receiving 3.2.  Active  Component  General  Procedures  .    Subject  to  prohibitions  in  Table  2.1  and restrictions  in  Table  2.2,  eligible  active  component  members  may  apply  for  an  active  duty retirement no earlier than 1  year and no later than 120 days before the desired retirement date.  Procedures  are  outlined  in  the  Personnel  Service  Delivery  Guide.    EXCEPTION:  When  the member  submits  the  application  under  the  assignment  declination  or  7DO/3DO  program,  see AFI  36-2110.    Enlisted  members  must  ask  for  a  retirement  date  that  falls  within  their  current enlistment or extension of enlistment. 3.2.1.  The  SecAF  may  prescribe,  for  specific  categories  of  members,  either  a  longer  or shorter application period. 3.2.2.  5 USC §8301 sets the effective date of all non-disability service retirements as the first day of the month after the month in which retirement otherwise would be effective. 3.2.3.  Commander or designated representative must make a recommendation on member’s application  and  identify  any  prohibitions  or  restrictions  outlined  in  Table  2.1  or  Table  2.2 (T-0). 3.2.3.1.  Commander  or  designated representative  must  determine determination is required for officer applicants (see paragraph  7.5) (T-0). if  a  grade 3.2.3.2.  A  member  approved  for  voluntary  retirement  remains  liable  for  assignment  or training  within  the  limits  of  the  retirement  date.    These  members  may  not  incur  a voluntary  service  commitment  later  than  the  retirement  date  without  the  option  to withdraw  the  application  or  to  negotiate  an  approved  change  in  the  retirement  month.  Members who receive approval to change a retirement month under this paragraph may become ineligible for promotion and may become ineligible to reenlist.    AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 33 3.3.  General Officer Procedures  . 3.3.1.  Active  component  General  Officers  apply  for  retirement  by  sending  a  personal, handwritten  letter  to  the  Air  Force  Chief  of  Staff  at  least  4  months  before  the  desired effective date.  For RC applications, see paragraph  3.3.4. 3.3.2.  Approval authority for retirement is as follows: 3.3.2.1.  In the case of voluntary retirements for Brigadier and Major Generals involving no adverse action or time-in-grade waivers, the Secretary of the Air Force has approval authority  for active component  officers  and the  RC Chiefs approves reserve  component officers. 3.3.2.2.  In  the  case  of  voluntary  retirements  for  Lieutenant  Generals  or  Generals involving no adverse action or time-in-grade waivers, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has approval authority. 3.3.2.3.  In the case of voluntary retirements for Brigadier and Major Generals involving time-in-grade waivers with or without adverse action, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has approval authority. 3.3.2.4.  In  the  case  of  voluntary  retirements  for  Lieutenant  Generals  or  Generals involving adverse action or time-in-grade waivers, the Secretary of Defense has approval authority. 3.3.2.5.  The SecDef grants the approval authority to the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and  Readiness  and  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force.    They  may  not  further delegate this authority. 3.3.3.  Unless granted a waiver under some provision of law, General Officers must serve on active duty or in an active status (RC officers) in the grade from which they retire for not less than 3 years. 3.3.3.1.  In the case of voluntary retirements for Brigadier and Major Generals, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness  has the  authority to  approve time-in-grade waivers. 3.3.3.1.1.  The SecDef grants the authority to the Under Secretary and to the Principal Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Personnel  and  Readiness.    They  may  not further delegate this authority. 3.3.3.2.  In  the  case  of  voluntary  retirements  for  Lieutenant  Generals  or  Generals,  the SecDef approves time-in-grade waivers. 3.3.3.3.  Officers who do not meet their TIG requirements retire in the next lower grade in which they served on active duty satisfactorily, as determined by the SecDef or for at least 6 months of creditable service TIG for RC members. 3.3.4.  For Reserve and ANG, General Officers must use the AF IMT Form 131, Application for  Transfer  to  the  Retired  Reserve,  if  applying  for  transfer  to  the  Retired  Reserve  or reserve  retired  pay  and  AF  IMT  Form  1160,  Military  Retirements  Actions,  to  apply  for active  duty  retirement.    Reserve  General  Officers  submit  their  applications  to  AF/REG  and ANG General Officers submit applications to ANG/GO (see Table 8.4). 34 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 3.4.  Application  by  Members  of  Reserve  Components  Not  on  Extended  Active Duty.  Eligible Reserve and ANG members may apply for a reserve retirement no earlier than 1 year  and  no  later  than  180  days  before  the  desired  retirement  date.    Most  Reserve  and  ANG members will utilize the Virtual  Retirement Application found on the Virtual  Personnel  Center website  (vPC).    Online  instructions  covering  application  procedures  and  routing  are  provided when applying. 3.4.1.  The online retirement application will apply to the following categories of personnel: 3.4.1.1.  ARC members who meet retirement eligibility requirements of 10 USC §12731 except for attainment of age 60.  For age 60 members, see paragraph  3.4.2.4. 3.4.2.  This  online  retirement  application  does  not  apply  to  the  following  categories  of personnel: 3.4.2.1.  ARC members whose Selective Early Removal from the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) has been directed  by SecAF (see paragraph  2.7). 3.4.2.2.  Retirement  in  lieu  of  administrative  discharge  action.    Members  who  are requesting retirement in lieu of administrative discharge and applying for transfer to the retired reserve while under a prohibition or restriction on retirement identified in Tables 2.1  and  2.2,  must  use  AF  IMT  Form  131  hard  copy  forms  as  part  of  the  administrative package. 3.4.2.3.  Personnel  medically  disqualified  for  continued  service  and  have  completed  15 years or more of creditable service. 3.4.2.4.  Officers separated due to non-selection for promotion (twice deferred) who have completed the years of service required for retired pay under 10 USC  Chapter 1223, or who must be separated for MSD, will be automatically transferred to the Retired Reserve, if qualified, unless the member applies to be discharged.  All enlisted members who must be separated due to maximum age or service based on high year tenure (HYT) will also be automatically transferred to the Retired Reserve, if qualified, or discharged. 3.4.2.5.  Officers who are removed from the active status under 10 USC §14903 (Board of  Inquiry),  and  are  eligible  for  transfer  to  the  Retired  Reserve  and  have  completed  the years  of  service  required  for  retired  pay  under  10  USC  Chapter  1223  (Per  10,  USC §14905).  Note:   These cases are processed for SAF action  IAW Table  2.2, Rule 3; see Note 6.  Officer Grade Determinations are required IAW Chapters 7 and 8. 3.4.2.6.  Former  members  who  elected  not  to  transfer  to  the  Retired  Reserve  and  were discharged for physical disqualification, misconduct, upon expiration of their contract, or who resigned their commission. 3.4.3.  Reserve Age and Service Requirements (10  USC  §12731).   This section pertains to Reserve members who attain eligibility for reserve retired pay. 3.4.3.1.  Upon  verification  of  retirement  eligibility,  HQ  ARPC  Retirements  will  send  a Notification  of  Eligibility  for  Retired  Pay  Letter to  each member within 1  year  after the member becomes eligible (10 USC §12731). This notification is commonly known as the “20-year letter.”  Additionally, “the 20-year letter” is available by self-service at the Virtual  Personnel  Center  (vPC)–ANG/AFR  dashboard.    Once  the  member  receives  the notification of eligibility letter, this eligibility may not be denied or revoked on the basis AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 35 of any error, miscalculation, misinformation, or administrative determination of years of service performed, unless it resulted directly from  the fraud or misrepresentation  by the member concerned (Title 10 USC §12738).  Members serving on active duty who accrue 20 creditable years of service also qualify for a reserve retirement and therefore will also receive “20-year letter” from HQ ARPC Retirements. 3.4.3.2.  AFPC  will  update  a  mandatory  date  of  separation  (DOS)  in  MilPDS  for  ARC  personnel  on  EAD  (i.e.,  AGRs)  who  will  reach  the  maximum  age  of  60.  When  the member reaches age 60, the member will separate from EAD to the ARC then HQ ARPC will retire the member from the ARC. The member’s final travel and movement of HHG will be shown on the separation order. 3.5.  Retired  Recall,  Release  from  Active  Duty  to  Revert  to  Retired  List.    When  the  AF recalls a member back to active duty from retired status for a specific period, the RAA releases him/her on the last day of that active duty period and reverts his/her record back to retired status on the next day.  The member’s original retirement date will never change;  rather, the member will now also have a “revert to retired status” effective date. 3.5.1.  Active Duty for Members in the Retired Reserve.  The AF may keep on AD or order to AD a member transferred or assigned to the Retired Reserve any time there is a valid need for  the  member’s  service.    The  AF  may  order  a  member  of  the  Retired  Reserve  to  AD involuntarily, if the Secretary of Defense decides that not enough qualified Reservists in an active status are readily available (10 USC §12301(a), 12301(d), 12307, or 688). 3.5.2.  Voluntary  Assignment  of  Members  from  the  Retired  Reserve.    Refer  to  paragraph  8.11.2.1 for assigning member on the USAF Reserve Retired List (Awaiting Pay) at age 60 (PAS  Code  ZA).    Reassignments  for  officers  require  approval  from  SecAF,  based  on member’s indispensability. 3.6.  Officers Desiring Active Duty Retirement in Enlisted Status  .  Only when documented hardship situations exist, when the SecAF or designee establishes a mandatory DOS, or when the SecAF  or  designee  approves  retirement  or  transfer  to  the  retired  reserve  in  lieu  of  involuntary separation, court-martial, or a court-martial sentence (See Table 2.2), can officers with 20 years TAFMS  request  to  retire  before  completing  10  years  of  TAFCS.    (NOTE:    When  allowed  by law,  the  SAF  may  elect  to  waive  TAFCS  to  8  years  under  an  existing  Force  Management program.)    The  officer  must  first  request  the  delegated  authority’s  approval  of  resignation  or release  from  active  duty  according  to  AFI  36-3206,  Administrative  Discharge  Procedures  for Commissioned  Officers.    The  appropriate  authority  must  authorize  enlistment  in  the  Active Component for the purpose of retirement. 3.6.1.  For  commissioned  officers  to  be  eligible  for  retirement  under  10  USC  §8911  they must  not  only  have  20  years  of  active  service  but  also  a  minimum  of  10  years  of  active commissioned  service  to  retire  as  an  officer  (10  years  commissioned  service  is  not  a requirement  for  officers  retiring  under  10  USC  §12731).  Without  meeting  both  of  these requirements,  they  are  ineligible  for  retirement  as  an  officer  regardless  of  TAFMS.  When allowed  by  law,  the  SecAF  may  elect  to  waive  TAFCS  to  8  years  under  an  existing  Force Management  program.    Title  10  USC  §8914  allows  for  enlisted  members  to  retire,  but specifically  requires  an  eligible  member  to  be  an  enlisted  member.    Because  there  are  no actual  provisions  of  law  that  would  allow  an  officer  to  retire  as  an  enlisted  member,  the following  procedure  has  been  developed.    This  strict  procedure  involves  a  number  of 36 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 AFPC/ARPC offices to process a retirement of an officer in enlisted status.  To retire as an enlisted  member,  the  officer  must  first  apply  for  separation.    After  applying  for  separation, the officer must then apply to be enlisted and accessed back as an enlisted member. 3.6.1.1.  If  the  member  is  allowed  to  enlist,  they  must  then  apply  for  retirement  in  that enlisted  status.  To  effect  an  enlisted  retirement,  officers  will  not  fill  enlisted  accession billets; rather, they will typically only hold their enlisted status for one day and then retire the  next.  Officers  desiring  to  retire  as  enlisted  members  are  required  to  be  in  enlisted status  upon  retirement  to  meet  the  requirements  of  10  USC  §8914  as  stated  above,  but they  may  not  fill  a  slot  or  remain  on  active  duty  in  this  status  for  any  longer  than required. A Regular officer may not apply for retirement in enlisted status until they first attain  enlisted  status  on  active  duty  prior  to  completing/submitting  a  retirement application in their new enlisted grade. To accomplish this type of retirement, the officer will  not  be  able  to  take  PTDY  or  terminal  leave  in  enlisted  status  in  conjunction  with retirement.  Approval of the retirement request and inability to use either permissive TDY or terminal leave may not be construed as a denial of entitlement(s). 3.6.1.2.  Refer to the Retirements PSD Guide on retirement processing procedures. 3.6.2.  Accrued  leave:  If  an  officer  separated  for  the  purpose  of  reentering  active  duty  in enlisted status, then 37 USC §501 and DoDFMR, Vol 7A, Chapter 35, Table 35-2, Rule 2 prohibits payment of accrued leave.  If the AF separates an officer for failure of selection to a higher grade and he/she immediately reenters the active component in an enlisted status, then finance  regulations  allow  payment  of  accrued  leave.    Officers  who,  after  notification  of  an impending  discharge,  resign  for  the  purpose  of  continuing  a  military  career  cannot  receive payment  for  accrued  leave  (37  USC  §501  and  DoDFMR  7000.14-R,  Vol  7A,  Chapter  35, Table 35-2, Rule 4 and Note 1). 3.6.2.1.  The  officer  is  not  able  to  take  terminal  leave,  but  may,  as  an  exception  to policy,  request  PTDY  and  ordinary  leave  in  their  officer  status.    If  approved,  they may  take  the  PTDY  and  ordinary  leave  prior  to  their  separation  as  an  officer.  Members must have retirement orders in hand before they can out-process and retire. Because orders under paragraph  3.6 are not published before the date of enlistment, it is imperative that officers return to their unit following PTDY and ordinary leave for final out-processing. 3.6.3.  When  the  member  in  paragraph    3.6.2.1  accumulates  30  years  of  active  duty  plus service  on  the  retired  list,  the  member  will  be  advanced  to  the  highest  grade  held satisfactorily on active duty as determined by the SecAF, see paragraph  7.5.  If there is doubt the officer serves satisfactorily in the officer grade, the RAA must initiate an Officer Grade Determination  for  the  SecAF  to  consider  when  deciding  whether  or  not  to  advance  the member at 30 years see paragraph  7.6. 3.6.4.  In  rare  cases,  the  officer’s  advanced  grade  may  equate  to  a  lower  rate  of  retired  pay than the enlisted retired pay.  Title 10 USC §8965 allows the member 3 months to turn down the  advancement.  Example:  a  MSgt  advanced  to  2Lt  may  receive  lower  retired  pay  when advanced to  2Lt.   To turn down the advancement, the member should contact  the RAA for instructions.  AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 37 3.6.5.  Member is entitled to ID card showing the advancement grade on advancement date. 3.7.  Immediate Retirement of Members Removed From the Temporary Disability Retired List  (TDRL).  If  the  USAF  Physical  Evaluation  Board  (PEB)  finds  a  member  fit  for  duty  and removes the member’s name from the TDRL, and the action renders the member eligible to retire for years of service or age, the member may ask to be retired upon removal from the TDRL. (See AFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation). 3.7.1.  The  Air  Force  Disability  Division  (AFPC/DPFD)  notifies  the  TDRL  member  when the PEB finds the member fit for duty. 3.7.2.  If the TDRL member does not  concur with the finding of fitness,  AFPC submits the case  for  Secretarial  determination.    If  the  SecAF  finds  the  member  fit  for  duty,  AFPC informs the member of the decision. 3.7.3.  Upon  notification  of  the  fitness  determination,  if  eligible,  a  member  can  initiate  a request  for  retirement  or  transfer  to  the  retired  reserve.    AFPC  returns  the  application  for retirement or transfer to the retired reserve to the RAA for completion of processing. 3.8.  Suspension or Curtailment of Voluntary Retirement Due to National Emergency (Stop Loss).  The President may suspend voluntary retirements under conditions prescribed in 10 USC §123 and §12305. 3.8.1.  When  notified  by  the  Officer  or  Enlisted  Policy  Divisions  (HQ  USAF/A1P)  to suspend active component losses, AFPC announces suspension of retirements. 3.8.2.  The RegAF, Reserve and the ANG components determine to what extent the AF will suspend active, reserve and guard losses.   38 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 Table 3.1.  Voluntary Retirement.

Applicability.  This  section  outlines  mandatory  retirement  policies  for  the  Active  and Reserve components. 4.2.  Mandatory Separation Date (MSD) for Retirement. 4.2.1.  Active Component. 4.2.1.1.  For  Active  Component  Officers,  Table  4.1  lists  the  dates  set  by  law  and  the conditions  for  approving  Regular  officers’  retirement  requests  based  on  MSD,  years  of service, age, promotion deferral, board, or other actions approved by the SecAF. 4.2.1.2.  Active Component enlisted members must voluntarily request retirement (10 USC  §8914  and  §8917).    If  an  enlisted  member  does  not  submit  a  retirement application  before  his/her  DOS,  that  member  will  be  separated.    An  active  duty service commitment expiring after an enlisted member’s established HYT month will be  automatically  waived  when  the  member  requests  to  retire  the  month  following HYT.  Refer to the PSD Guide on retirement processing procedures. 4.2.2.  Air Reserve Component (ARC) (Air Force Reserve/Air National Guard). 4.2.2.1.  Effective  1  July  2002,  all  ARC  officers  who  are  separated  for  MSD  or  twice deferred for promotion will be transferred to the Retired Reserve, if qualified, unless the member applies to be discharged.  Table 4.2 lists the dates set by law and the conditions for approving Reserve officers’ retirement requests based on MSD, years of service, age, promotion deferral, board, or other actions approved by the SecAF. 4.2.2.2.  All  ARC  enlisted  members  who  are  separated  due  to  maximum  age  or  service due  to  HYT  will  also  be  transferred  to  the  Retired  Reserve,  if  qualified,  or  discharged.  HYT does not apply to ANG enlisted members. 4.2.3.  SecAF Authority to Delay Retirement. 4.2.3.1.  For all components, the SecAF or designee may delay an officer’s retirement as necessary  to  allow  completion  of  disciplinary  action  with  a  view  toward  court-martial  (10 USC §639) or medical evaluation (10 USC §640). 4.2.3.2.  To delay a MSD for continuation on active duty to complete court martial action (10  USC  §639),  the  commander  or  base  SJA  notifies  the  appropriate  RAA  of  the circumstances  (T-0).    The  RAA  forwards  the  request  to  the  SecAF  or  designee  for determination. 4.2.3.3.  If the SecAF or designee approves the delay, the appropriate RAA rescinds the officer’s  retirement  order  and  extends  the  MSD  in  three  month  increments  until completion of the action. 4.2.3.4.  When  the  court-martial  authority  (CMA)  notifies  the  officer  that  he/she  has initiated  court-martial  charges  and  provides  the  notice  within  60  days  of  the  MSD,  the commander or base SJA requests in  writing that the RAA delay the  retirement to  allow the  CMA  to  consider/complete  disciplinary  action  (T-0).    If  the  CMA  subsequently 40 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 decides  not  to  pursue  court-martial  charges  and  permits  the  member  to  retire,  but  the original retirement date has passed, the member must retire on the first day of the month following the month the CMA made the decision not to pursue court-martial charges. 4.2.4.  If  the  AF  cannot  complete  a  medical  evaluation,  observation,  or  treatment  to determine entitlement to disability retirement on or before the MSD, the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) sends a request for medical hold to the AFPC Medical Standards Branch.  If the  officer’s  MSD  will  occur  within  60  days  of  being  placed  on  medical  hold  by  AFPC, procedures in the Retirements PSD guide apply. 4.2.5.  Retention  of  AFR  and  ANG  members  beyond  qualification  for  retired  pay  requires consent  of  the  individual  and  approval  by  the  SecAF  (10  USC  §12308).    Requests  for continuation will be submitted by the member’s unit to HQ AFRC and AF/REP for the AFR and  the  servicing  FSS  through  the  State  Adjutant  General  (TAG)  to  NGB/A1PP  for  the ANG. 4.2.5.1.  Submit  via  Case  Management  System  (CMS)  to  “Guard-NGB  Force  Mgt (A1POE) ANG [MAJCOM OPR].” 4.2.5.2.  Refer  to  ANG  FSS  Guidance  for  specific  continuation  in  service  package requirements. 4.3.  Service  for  Mandatory  Retirement.  Law  establishes  MSDs  for  Regular  officers  (Table 4.1). 4.4.  Uniform  Retirement  Date.  5  USC  §8301  sets  the  effective  date  of  all  active  component service  members  and  AGR  retirements  as  the  first  day  of  the  month  after  the  month  in  which retirement otherwise would be effective.  AFR and ANG retirements can take effect any day of the month unless dictated by MSD, HYT or other mandatory retirement date requirements. 4.5.  Notification of Mandatory Retirement. 4.5.1.  At  approximately  12  months  before  the  active  component  officer’s  MSD,  the  RAA will notify the member to start retirement processing. 4.5.2.  Active  component  enlisted  members  may  reenlist  or  extend  to  serve  to  HYT  as outlined  in  AFI  36-2606,  Reenlistment  in  the  United  States  Air  Force,  and  any  active  duty service  commitment  expiring  after  an  enlisted  member’s  established  HYT  date  will  be automatically waived.  As mentioned in paragraph  4.2.1.2., enlisted members are required to apply for retirement (10 USC §8914 and §8917) or will be separated on his/her DOS. 4.5.3.  For ARC officers only, HQ ARPC Separations Branch will send a written notification to  all  ARC  officers  who  are  approaching  their  MSD  or  have  been  twice  deferred  for promotion.  The notification will inform the member they will be transferred to the Retired Reserve, if eligible.  Those members who do not wish to retire must submit a written tender of  resignation  or  request  for  discharge.    Notification  will  be  forwarded  to  the  member’s servicing  MPF/Program  Manager.    The  MSD  or  twice-deferred  notification  will  be  used  to transfer the member to the Retired Reserve. 4.5.3.1.  For  AFRC  Unit  Program  enlisted  members,  the  servicing  MPS  will  notify members 14 months before their HYT that they  will be automatically transferred to  the Retired  Reserve,  if  qualified,  unless  they  apply  for  separation  or  are  approved  for extension of HYT.  HYT does not apply to ANG enlisted members. AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 41 4.6.  Actions  Following  Notification  of  Non-Selection  for  Promotion  .  Officers  notified  of non-selection for promotion and an established MSD must indicate whether they plan to retire on the MSD or voluntarily retire on an earlier date, if eligible. 4.7.  Voluntary  Retirement  on  the  Mandatory  Retirement  Date  .  Officers  may  request voluntary retirement dates to coincide with their MSDs, if they meet voluntary eligibility under any other provision of law. 4.8.  Tenure  and  Retirement  of  Permanent  Academy  Professors  .  The  SecAF  or  designee may retire a permanent professor with more than 30 years of service as a commissioned officer with  satisfactory  performance  or  keep  him/her  as  a  permanent  professor  to  age  64  (10  USC §8920). Satisfactory performance as a permanent professor, in  most cases, justifies retention  to age 64. 4.8.1.  The Secretary may make exceptions to this policy. 4.8.2.  The Superintendent of the United States Air Force Academy may recommend that the  President  retire  a  permanent  professor  who  has  long  and  distinguished  service  as  a permanent professor and holds a grade below brigadier general at retirement, in the grade of brigadier general (see paragraph  7.4.). 4.9.  Recall  or  Retention  of  Active  Duty  and  Reserve  Officers  Beyond  Mandatory Retirement Date.  4.9.1.  The  AF  may  order  any  retired  officer  of  the  Regular  or  Air  Force  Reserve  to  active duty  after  mandatory  retirement  by  recall  under  10  USC  §688,  §12301(b)  or  §12307.  However,  the  AF  cannot  recall  officers  retired  by  SERB  or  ESERB  action  except  during  a time of war or national emergency declared by Congress or the President.  Similarly, the AF cannot  recall  to  active  duty  retired  officers  who,  after  receiving  notification  that  the  AF would consider them for early retirement under 10 USC §638 or 638a, requested retirement before consideration by that board. 4.9.2.  A  selection  board  acting  under  10  USC  §637  may  defer  only  the  MSD  of  Regular officers who are serving in or selected for promotion to the Regular grades shown in  Table 4.1. See AFI 36-2501, Officer Promotions and Selective Continuation, for instructions on the AF’s continuation process for twice non-selected officers. 4.10.  Selective Early  Retirement.  Under the provisions of 10 USC §638, §638a, and §14704, an Air  Force selection board may  consider officers for involuntary  retirement earlier than their MSDs (as shown in Table 4.1, Rules 5 through 24).  The SecAF will use this authority to select officers for early retirement sparingly in order to manage an officer grade imbalance or strength overage  within  a  competitive  category  (DoD  Directive  (DoDD)  1332.32,  Selective  Early Retirement  of  Officers  on  an  Active  Duty  List  and  the  Reserve  Active  Status  List  and  Selective Early  Removal  of  Officers  from  the  Reserve  Active  Status  List).    The  AF  may  not  use  this authority  for  the  sole  purpose  of  enhancing  promotion  opportunity,  nor  substitute  it  for disposition of officers the AF should separate for cause. 4.10.1.  Officers  selected  for  early  retirement  may  be  retained  on  active  duty  beyond  the statutorily-prescribed  time  limit  in  10  USC  §638  and  §638a  for  no  more  than  90  days  if approved  by  SecAF.    Procedures  will  be  outlined  in  the  Personnel  Services  Delivery Memorandum approved by the SecAF. 42 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 4.11.  Retirement  for  Age  .    Officers  who  reach  the  mandatory  age  requirement  outlined  in table  4.1  are  retired  due  to  age  rather  than  length  of  service,  under  10  USC  §1251.    Officers retired for age are not required to have the minimum TAFMS or TAFCS required for retirement under other provisions of law. 4.12.  Suspension of Mandatory Retirement of Regular and Reserve Officers Due to War or National Emergency (Stop Loss).  In times of war or national emergency declared by Congress or  the  President,  the  President  may  suspend  the  operation  of  laws  relating  to  mandatory retirement of Regular and Reserve officers (10 USC §123 and §12305).  The SecAF or his/her designated  representative  exercises  this  authority  sparingly,  depending  on  AF  needs  and  the nature of the emergency, and will consider each case on its own merits.  Officers retained beyond their MSD will stay on active duty until the Secretary determines the AF no longer needs their services to support the present emergency.  After the AF terminates Stop Loss, officers serving after their MSDs will have up to 90 days before they must retire. 4.12.1.  HQ  USAF/A1  provides  instructions  and  notifies  AFPC  when  to  announce  the suspension of mandatory retirements.   AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 43 Table 4.1.

Under 10 USC § 1253(b), the President may defer the retirement age to a date not beyond the first  day  of  the  month  following  the  month  in  which  the  officer  becomes  68  years  of  age;  or  the Secretary of Defense may defer the retirement age to a date not beyond the first day of the month following the month in which the officer becomes 66 years of age.  This note only applies to those officers in the rank of Lieutenant General (O-9) and General (O-10).  *2.  Under 10  USC §1251, the Air Force may defer Regular medical  officers, dental officers, and nurses from retirement until age 68 if, during the period of deferment, the officers perform duties  consisting  primarily  of  providing  patient  care  or  performing  other  clinical  duties,  or duties necessary to meet the needs of the Air Force. The Air Force may also defer the retirement of an officer, who the AF appointed or designated as a chaplain, until age 68 if it is determined that such a deferral serves the best interest of the Air Force.  See PSD guide for instructions on submitting requests for deferral.  *3.    Before  SecAF  can  consider  an  officer  for  the  position  of  Superintendent  of  the  United States Air Force Academy (USAFA), the officer will enter into an agreement with the SecAF to signify  that  the  officer  will  accept  retirement  upon  termination  of  the  detail  unless  SecAF waives such retirement under 10 USC § 8921(b).       48 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 Table 4.2.  Mandatory Retirement for All Reserve Officers. Officers are required to retire upon attaining retirement eligibility.  Under conditions listed below, a request to be retained beyond retirement eligibility may be submitted. Maximum continuation is established in law as the Mandatory Separation Date (MSD) indicated.  Continuation beyond retirement eligibility for any period up to a maximum of the MSD requires SecAF approval.

The maximum length of retention is two years.  Members who require retainability to meet an O-6 board may submit additional retention requests provided they remain within limitations of the maximum age provision  50 NOTES: AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 1.  Service credit: Any person who has qualified for retired pay under 10 USC Chapter 1223 may be retained in service in a Reserve Component by order of the Secretary concerned, be retained on active duty, or in service in a Reserve Component other than service listed in 10 USC §12732(b). A member so retained shall be automatically credited with that service for all purposes (to include points) in accordance with 10 USC §12308.  2.  The retirement of a Reserve officer of the Air Force in the grade of Lieutenant General or General may be deferred (1) by the President, but such a deferment may not extend beyond the first day of the month following the month in which the officer becomes 68 years of age; or (2) by the Secretary of Defense, but such a deferment may not extend beyond the first day of the month following the month in which the officer reaches 66 years of age.  3.  Retention beyond qualification for retired pay requires consent of the individual and approval by the SecAF.  Refer to paragraph 4.2.5 for SecAF approval procedures. 4.  ANG officers who are employed as a Military Technician (MT) and whose separation is required due to length of service may be retained beyond the MSD until the officer qualifies for an immediate, unreduced civil service annuity (CSRS or FERS), or age 55, whichever is earlier. The State Adjutant General (TAG) may approve such retention.  A copy of the written approval signed by TAG will be sent to ANGRC/A1PP for Colonels and below and NGB-GO/AF for General Officers. Requests for retention beyond age 55 must be forwarded through NGB-GO/AF to the Chief, NGB or ANGRC/A1PP for approval.  Extensions will only be approved until an officer qualifies for an immediate reduced annuity. 5.  Retention of Health Professionals and Chaplains under 10 USC 14703. SecAF may, with the officer’s consent, retain in active status medical and dental officers, Air Force nurses, chaplains, or individuals designated as biomedical sciences officers or medical service corps officers until age 68. The officer must initiate the request for retention and forward it through command channels to NGB/A1, Directorate of Manpower, Personnel and Services (for ANG officers) or HQ AFRC/A1 (for USAFR Officers). The request must be submitted at least 6 months prior to the officer becoming eligible for retirement. Refer to paragraph 4.2.5 for submission requirements. AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 51 Chapter 5 RETIREMENT MEDICAL EXAMINATION 5.1.  Standard Medical Examination for RegAF, AFR  and ANG  . All retiring members must take  a  comprehensive  Separation  History  and  Physical  Examination  (SHPE)  unless  they  are separating or retiring after being found unfit for continued military service through the disability evaluation process and have completed the exams in that process. 5.1.1.  The  member  may  elect  to  have  the  SHPE  accomplished  through  a  DoD  medical treatment facility (MTF) or through the Veterans Administration (VA). 5.1.2.  The  SHPE  must  be  accomplished  at  least  30  days  prior  to  the  scheduled  departure date, but no more than 180 days prior to the approved retirement date. 5.1.3.  The  MTF  uses  the  applicable  guidance  to  determine  the  scope  of  the  medical examination and, if necessary, coordinates with the VA to ensure all required documentation is recorded in the member’s record prior to departure.  Note:  The SHPE must be recorded in the member’s record before the MTF will clear the member for departure. 5.1.4.  The  Military  Personnel  Section  (MPS)  ensures  the  member  is  cleared  by  the  MTF prior to outprocessing. 5.2.  Waiver of SHPE.  If a previously completed qualifying examination is documented in the member’s  record,  the  Service  Member  may  complete  a  DD  Form  2697,  Report  of  Medical Assessment, in lieu of the entire SHPE.  Waiver of the SHPE requires the consent of the member and  concurrence  of  the  unit  commander.    The  waiver  will  be  processed  through  the  member’s MTF prior to the MTF clearing the member for departure. 5.3.  Medical  Service  Officers  (Other  Than  General  Officers).  Officers  of  the  Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC), Dental Corps (DC), Medical Corps (MC), Medical Service Corps (MSC), Nurse  Corps  (NC),  and  Veterinary  Corps  (VC),  who  require  an  examination  according  to paragraph    5.1  may  use  their  own  facility.  If  the  examination  results  in  MEB  and  PEB  action, AFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation, applies. 5.4.  Procedures  for  Initiating  a  Medical  Hold.  Procedures  are  outlined  in  the  Retirements PSD guide.    Officers may not waive the medical hold because they serve at the direction of the President.  Enlisted  members  with  insufficient  service  retainability  for  MEB/PEB  processing must  agree  to  and  voluntarily  extend  their  enlistment  for  the  hold  period.    Medical  hold  is  a method  of  retaining  a  service  member  beyond  an  established  retirement  or  separation  date  for reason of disability processing  IAW AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force and AFI 41-210, TRICARE Operations and Patient Administration Functions.  Enlisted members who  are  within  6  months  of  their  Date  of  Separation  and  refuse  to  remain  on  active  duty  for MEB/PEB  processing  must  provide  documentation  of  their  waiver  of  Disability  Evaluation processing when applying for voluntary retirement. 52 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 Chapter 6 RECOGNITION ON RETIREMENT 6.1.  Recognition of RegAF, AFR and ANG Members Being Retired. 6.1.1.  Tradition. One of the oldest traditions of military service is to recognize members who are retiring from a career of long and honorable service.  Military members should retire with a tangible expression of appreciation for their contributions to the Air Force and our mission.  They should retire with the assurance that the AF continues to view them as members of the Air Force family in retirement. 6.1.2.  Responsibility.  Commanders  must  evaluate  and  recognize  the  contributions  of  their retiring members (T-3). Commanders will ensure a retirement ceremony is conducted for all retiring members unless the member specifically requests not to have a ceremony (T-3). 6.1.3.  Ceremony.  In keeping with the customs and traditions of the service, all members are  entitled  to  a  ceremony  (T-3);  however,  the  member  may  choose  to  not  have  a ceremony at all. 6.1.3.1.  If  the  member  chooses  to  do  a  ceremony,  the  commander  may  include  the ceremony as part of a formal military formation, such as a retreat or parade, use the Honor  Guard,  Band,  Chaplain,  and  other  federal  resources  as  mission  permits.    The immediate commander will ensure the retirement ceremony meets the basic intent and traditions  of  a  military  function,  as  spelled  out  in  AFI  1-1,  Air  Force  Culture,  Air Force  Standards.    However,  the  member  has  the  added  flexibility  in  tailoring  the ceremony  to  meet  their  individual  desires  consistent  with  AFI  1-1.

At  the  retirement ceremony, present the certificate along with other documents (see paragraph  6.1.).  Airmen who are placed on the TDRL, whose status changes to a permanent retirement, whether for  years of service or disability, are issued a Certificate of Appreciation for Service. 6.5.1.  Airmen will receive a DD Form 2542 with the name of the President in office at the time of the Airman’s  retirement.  Each new President must authorize an updated DD  Form 2542 when he/she takes office.  If the effective date of retirement occurs on or after the new President’s inauguration, use certificates with the new President’s signature. 6.5.2.  Instructions  for  completion  of  the  certificate  for  active  and  AFR/ANG  members  are found in the Retirements PSD Guide.  The certificate is completed by ARPC for Reserve and Guard members not serving on EAD. 6.6.  Letter of Appreciation from the President of the United States  .

The commander makes sure members have every award and decoration to which they are entitled before retirement (T-3). 6.8.2.  Retiring members who are not receiving an award may choose to have their ceremony separate from those who are. AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 57 Chapter 7 DETERMINING RETIRED GRADE AND PAY 7.1.  General Information.  This chapter provides general information about determining active and  ARC  retired  grade  and  pay,  advancement  on  the  retired  list,  and  computation  of  service under  laws  now  in  effect,  including  those  implemented  by  the  Defense  Officer  Personnel Management  Act  (DOPMA)  effective  15  September  1981  (Public  Law  96-513).  NOTE:  This chapter is not intended to be a complete and authoritative source of reference on these subjects and  does  not  imply  any  right,  benefit  or  privilege  with  respect  to  retirements.  Retired  pay estimates for disability retirees are in AFI 36-3212. 7.2.  General Rules on Retired Grade. 7.2.1.  A commissioned officer retiring for other than disability and other than age or service requirements is retired in the highest grade held satisfactorily, as determined by the SecAF or SecAF delegee, with at least 6 months’ time in grade (TIG) on active duty for an active duty retirement  or  for  service  creditable  towards  a  reserve  retirement  under  10  USC  §12371  for ARC members.  As discussed below, there are additional TIG requirements for “voluntary” retirement in any grade higher than Major (10 USC §1370). 7.2.2.  TIG is calculated from the effective date of promotion. 7.2.3.  Officers who do not meet satisfactory service and the minimum TIG requirements for the highest grade held, and who do not gain TIG waivers from the AF, can retire in the next lower grade held satisfactorily, as determined by the SecAF or delegee, for at least 6 months (10 USC §1370(b)). 7.2.4.  Once TIG requirements are established or waived, the SecAF or delegee determines if the  service  was  satisfactorily  held  in  that  grade  while  on  active  duty  for  active  duty retirements  or  during  creditable  service  for  ARC  members  retiring  under  10  USC  §12371, IAW procedures at paragraph  7.6. 7.2.5.  Three-year TIG requirement for retirement above the grade of Major.  To voluntarily retire  in  any  grade  higher  than  Major,  an  officer  must  have  satisfactorily  served,  as determined by the SecAF or SecAF delegee, a minimum of 3 years TIG while on active duty for active duty retirements or  during creditable service for ARC members retiring under 10 USC §12371, unless granted a SecAF TIG waiver. 7.2.5.1.  Waiver of 3-year TIG requirement for retirement above the grade of Major. (See corresponding Rules and Notes at Table 2.2) 7.2.5.1.1.  When  authorized  by  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  the  SecAF  or  SecAF delegee may approve retirement of an officer above the grade of Major who does not meet the 3-year TIG criteria if the officer has satisfactorily served, as determined by the  SecAF  or  SecAF  delegee,  a  minimum  of  2  years  TIG  while  on  active  duty  for active duty retirements or during creditable service for ARC members retiring under 10  USC  §12371.    Requests  must  include  strong  justification  and  documentation  to support that the waiver would satisfy the best interests of the Air Force.  See Section 2C. 58 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 7.2.5.1.2.  In very rare cases, the President may approve an active duty retirement of an officer above the grade of Major who has less than 2 years TIG if the officer has at least  6  months  of  creditable  active  duty  service  in  that  grade.    This  Presidential authority is used only in cases involving extreme hardship or exceptional or unusual circumstances (10 USC §1370(a)(2)(D)). This Presidential waiver authority cannot be delegated.  Requests  must  include  strong  justification  and  documentation  to  support statutory criteria of “extreme hardship” or “exceptional or unusual circumstances.” 7.2.5.2.  There  are  statutory  exceptions  to  3-year  TIG  requirement  for  retirement  above the grade of Major. 7.2.5.2.1.  Officers who  apply  for active duty retirement under 10  USC §8911, after being told they will be released from the active component involuntarily, retire in the highest  grade  held  on  active  duty  satisfactorily,  as  determined  by  the  SecAF  or designee, for at least 6 months TIG (10 USC §1370 (a)(3)). 7.2.5.2.2.  Officers who apply for reserve retirement under 10 USC §12371 may retire in the highest grade held satisfactorily, as determined by the SecAF or designee, for at least 6 months TIG during creditable reserve service if their inability to obtain three years TIG is based on nondiscretionary or position-specific criteria as specified at 10 USC §1370d(3)(B) - (F). 7.2.6.  If enlisted members of the Regular force retire for other than disability, they retire in the Regular grade held on the date of retirement unless entitled to a higher grade under some other provision of law. Reserve enlisted members of the Air Force who retire under 10 USC §8914  after  September  30,  1996  may  be  entitled  to  a  higher  grade  held  satisfactorily  on active duty as a Reserve/Guard member (10 USC §8963). The SecAF or designee determines the retired grade, provided there is no evidence of record to indicate unsatisfactory service in the higher grade. Specifically, this provision applies to Reserve enlisted members serving on active duty who have been reduced in grade not as a result of the member’s misconduct, but rather as an administrative reduction. 7.3.  Reserve  Age  and  Service  Requirements  (10    USC    §12731).  This  section  pertains  to Reserve members who attain eligibility for reserve retired pay. 7.3.1.  Upon  verification  of  retirement  eligibility,  HQ  ARPC  Retirements  will  send  a Notification  of  Eligibility  for  Retired  Pay  Letter to  each member within 1  year after the member  becomes  eligible  (10  USC  §12731).  This  notification  is  commonly  known  as  the “20-year letter.”  Additionally, “the 20-year letter” is available by self-service at the Virtual Personnel Center (vPC)–ANG/AFR dashboard. Once the member receives the notification of eligibility  letter,  this  eligibility  may  not  be  denied  or  revoked  on  the  basis  of  any  error, miscalculation,  misinformation,  or  administrative  determination  of  years  of  service performed,  unless  it  resulted  directly  from  the  fraud  or  misrepresentation  by  the  member concerned (Title 10 USC §12738).  As referenced in paragraph  3.4.3.1 members serving on active duty who accrue 20 creditable years of service also qualify for a reserve retirement and therefore will also receive “20-year letter” from HQ ARPC Retirements. 7.3.2.  AFPC  will  update  a  mandatory  date  of  separation  (DOS)  in  MilPDS  for  ARC  personnel  in  full  time  support  status  (i.e.,  AGRs)  who  will  reach  the  maximum  age  of  60. When the member reaches age 60, the member will separate from EAD to the ARC then HQ AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 59 ARPC  will  retire  the  member  from  the  ARC.  The  member’s  final  travel  and  movement  of HHG will be shown on the separation order. 7.4.  Higher  Retired  Grade  for  Regular  Commissioned  Officers  in  Special  Positions.  A permanent professor of USAFA who is in a grade below Brigadier General and whose service as such professor has been long and distinguished may, at the discretion of the President, retire in the grade of brigadier general (10 USC §8962 and §1370, and paragraph  4.8 of this AFI). Use the  rates  for  the  grade  held  on  the  last  day  of  active  duty  to  compute  retired  pay.  Air  Staff agencies  preparing  retirement  orders  should  address  the  member  as  “Colonel”  and  indicate “Colonel” in the “Highest Grade Held on Active Duty” space under the “Pay Grade” portion of the order.  The “Retired  In”  space  of  the  “Pay  Grade”  portion  should  reflect  “Brigadier  General.”    The  following  statement  should  be  placed  in  the  “Remarks”  portion  of  the  order: “Retired  in  the  grade  of  Brigadier  General  under  the  provision  of  10  USC  §8962.”  These remarks will indicate to DFAS that this retired grade is a title change and does not result in a pay change. 7.5.  Advancing Enlisted Members to a Higher Grade After 30 Years of Service. 7.5.1.  When Regular enlisted members’ and certain reserve enlisted members’ active service plus service on the retired list totals 30 years, they may be advanced on the retired list to the highest  grade  served  on  active  duty  satisfactorily  and  receive  retired  pay  in  that  grade,  as determined  by  the  SecAF  or  designee  under  10  USC  §8964  (see  PSD Guide on AFPC MyPers website for processing procedures). See paragraph  7.7 for re-computation of retired pay after advancement. 7.5.2.  Indicators that  service was not satisfactory: 7.5.2.1.  The member held the highest grade for less than 6 months 7.5.2.2.  The highest grade held was terminated for cause 7.5.2.3.  Retirement was in lieu of or a result of a demotion action and the retired grade is not the highest grade held, or 7.5.2.4.  New evidence exists about misconduct during past service. 7.5.3.  If a member’s retired grade is two or more grades lower than the highest grade  held, SECAF  or  designee  may  advance  the  member  to  whichever  grade  is  the  highest  served  on active duty satisfactorily. 7.5.4.  If  the  member’s  highest  grade  held  was  attained  after  retirement,  the  member  must send  copies  of  documents  verifying  each  period  of  active  service  while  holding  the  higher grade to AFPC or to other appropriate order-issuing authority. 7.5.5.  Restoration of Former Grade. Retired enlisted members who have been advanced on the  retired  list  to  a  higher  commissioned  grade  may  be  restored  to  their  former  retired enlisted status if approved by the SecAF or designee (refer to paragraph  3.6.4.). 7.5.5.1.  Within  3  months  after  being  advanced,  members  send  requests  to  AFPC  or  to other appropriate orders issuing authority. 7.5.5.2.  An election to return to a former grade is not reversible (29 Comptroller General 179; 10 USC §8965). 60 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 7.6.  Officer Grade Determination (OGD) in Conjunction with Retirement (10 USC §1370 and 10 USC §12771).  An officer is not automatically entitled to retire in the highest grade held.  Instead, an officer is retired in the highest grade served on active duty satisfactorily or creditable service for ARC members retiring under §12731, as determined by the SecAF or delegee.  The SecAF or delegee may seek the review and recommendation of the SAF Personnel Council prior to  making  a  determination  of  satisfactory  service  for  an  OGD  in  the  case  of  any  officer  in  the grade of 0-6 or below who is seeking to retire. 7.6.1.  OGDs will result in either a decision to retain the officer’s current grade as the retired grade or change the retired grade to a grade lower than that currently held.  Except as noted below,  officer  grade  determinations  must  be  completed  prior  to  retirement  or  disability separation, and the officer’s retired grade is fixed at that time. 7.6.1.1.  If  the  separation  and/or  accompanying  grade  determination  was  procured  by fraud. 7.6.1.2.  If  substantial  new  evidence  is  discovered  following  separation  which  could have resulted in a lower grade determination had it been known or reasonably could have  been  known  by  competent  authority  at  the  time  of  separation,  a  new  grade determination  may  be  completed.    For  example,  if  an  officer  is  later  discovered  to have  engaged  in  misconduct  which  occurred  prior  to  the  effective  retirement  or disability separation date that was not discoverable through due diligence prior to the effective retirement or disability separation date, and such misconduct is  of a nature to warrant reconsideration of the appropriateness of the approved retirement grade, a new grade determination may be completed. 7.6.1.3.  If a mistake of law or mathematical miscalculation led to an improper separation or grade determination. 7.6.2.  The  determination  of  “satisfactory  or  creditable  service”  in  a  particular  grade  is  a matter of Secretarial discretion. 7.6.2.1.  Consideration  of  satisfactory  or  creditable  service  is  not  limited  to  the  TIG required  for  the  higher  grade;  rather,  it  includes  the  officer’s  entire  period  of  service  in grade. 7.6.2.2.  In considering whether an officer has provided satisfactory or creditable service, the SAF Personnel Council may consider the nature and length of the officer’s improper conduct,  the impact  the conduct  had on military  effectiveness, the quality and length  of the officer’s service in each grade at issue, past cases involving similar conduct, and the recommendations of the officer’s command chain.  A single incident of misconduct can render  service  in  a  grade  unsatisfactory  despite  a  substantial  period  of  otherwise exemplary service. 7.6.2.3.  An  OGD  resulting  in  retirement  in  a  lower  grade  is  not  punishment.    It  is  an administrative  action  that  determines  the  highest  grade  in  which  an  officer  served satisfactorily. 7.6.3.  Initiating an OGD.  The unit commander or other appropriate authority (including an authority designated for this purpose by the SecAF or designee) will initiate an OGD when (T-0): AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 61 7.6.3.1.  The  officer  has  applied  for  retirement  in  lieu  of  judicial  or  administrative separation action (Table 2.2, Rules 3 thru 5).  In this case, the SecAF makes an OGD in conjunction  with  his/her  decision  to  permit  the  officer  to  retire  or  not.    See  paragraph  7.6.6 below. 7.6.3.2.  The officer has a court-martial conviction. 7.6.3.3.  The  officer  has  a  civil  court  conviction  for  misconduct  which,  did  (or  would) result  in  a  mandatory  comment  and  referral  in  the  member’s  next  OPR,  training  report, PRF, in accordance with AFI 36-2406. 7.6.3.4.  The officer received nonjudicial punishment pursuant to Article 15, Uniform Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ),  a  reprimand  or  an  admonition,  since  the  officer’s last promotion; 7.6.3.5.  The officer, in the grade of Major (O-4) or above, since their last promotion, has been the subject of any substantiated adverse finding(s) or conclusion(s) from an officially  documented  investigation,  proceeding,  or  inquiry  conducted  by  competent military or civilian authorities (exception minor traffic infractions), regardless of the command action taken against the officer (if any). 7.6.3.6.  In  any  other  case  in  which  the  commander  or  other  appropriate  authority believes an OGD appropriate. 7.6.4.  If  any  of  the  above  listed  circumstances  exist,  the  commander  must  initiate  an ODG (T-0).  To determine whether such adverse information exists, commanders should send  a  formal  request  for  a  records  review  to  the  following  offices/personnel:    IG,  JA, and  MPF.    Additionally,  commanders  should  review  the  member’s  PIF  (if  any)  and contact  previous commanders.  When  an OGD is initiated under paragraph 7.6.3.6., the wing  commander  may  terminate  the  OGD,  if  appropriate.    He  or  she  must  address  a memorandum  to  the  RAA  and  in  a  signed  statement  explain  the  basis  recommending against an OGD (T-1).  The subject officer must be notified of the reason(s) for initiating the  OGD  and  afforded  an  opportunity  to  respond  in  accordance  with  the  timelines  and rights  identified  in  the  notification  memo  (Figure  7.1).    All  information  relevant  and material  to  the  determination  of  “satisfactory  service”  in  each  grade  at  issue  must  be provided  to  the  subject  officer  with  the  opportunity  to  respond.    Procedures  for processing the ODG are outlined in the PSD guide. 7.6.5.  If an officer has applied for retirement and the member’s leadership later determines that the officer’s conduct  requires an  OGD, the  commander immediately notifies the RAA, who will suspend the retirement whenever possible (T-1). 7.6.5.1.  If  information  not  included  in  the  original  notification  (other  than  that  in  the officer's personnel records) is considered or added at any stage that was not included in the  original  notification,  the  officer  must  be  provided  notice  and  a  copy  of  relevant information together with an opportunity to respond. 7.6.5.2.  Processing  of  an  OGD  will  not  suspend  a  Regular  officer’s  mandatory retirement.    In  any  case  where  the  mandatory  retirement  date  comes  to  pass  before  the completion of a mandated OGD, the officer shall be retired in the next grade lower than their current grade on the mandatory retirement date and their final retirement grade shall 62 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 be determined by the SECAF or Delegee (or OSD, as required, for General Officers), but not later than 12 months after the mandatory retirement date. 7.6.6.  If an officer submits a request  to  retire in  lieu of an administrative or judicial action which placed a restriction on his  retirement  IAW  Table  2.2, Rules 3-5, the officer shall be considered on notice that he/she is subject to an OGD based on that administrative or judicial action. 7.6.6.1.  The officer is required to submit with the retirement request a signed and dated statement  acknowledging  the  administrative  or  judicial  action  placing  a  restriction  on their  retirement,  including  the  date  they  were  notified  of  the  administrative  or  judicial action.    It  shall  also  include  the  officer’s  acknowledgement  of  understanding  that  by submitting their retirement request, they are subject to an OGD based on the underlying administrative  or  judicial  action;  that  they  have  a  right  to  consult  counsel  and  submit written  matters;  and  whether  or  not  they  attached  written  matters  relevant  to  the  grade determination. 7.6.6.2.  The  officer’s  commander  is  not  required  to  separately  notify  the  officer  of  the OGD unless he/she intends to add or consider evidence that was not already provided to the  officer  during  the  underlying  administrative  or  judicial  action.    If  any  commander finds that additional evidence should be considered in  the OGD action, the officer shall be appropriately notified.  See paragraph 7.6.5.1. 7.6.6.3.  After  the  officer  submits  their  acknowledgement  and  matters,  if  any,  the commander  provides  a  written  recommendation  for  the  appropriate  retirement  grade, using  the  sample  memo  in  the  PSD  Guide  (T-1).    The  commander  should  state  the matters  considered  in  making  the  grade  recommendation,  which  shall  be  based  on relevant  information  previously  provided  to  the  officer  or  otherwise  available  to  the officer in their official personnel record. 7.6.6.4.  Subsequent legal reviews and command recommendations shall be provided by the offices reviewing the request to retire in lieu of the administrative or judicial action.  OGD  legal  reviews  and  recommendations  may  be  included  within  the  reviews  and recommendations of the officer’s request to retire in lieu of the administrative or judicial action. 7.6.7.  AF/DPG  serves  as  focal  point  for  all  General  Officer  OGDs  for  active  duty retirements.    Contact  AF/DPG,  Sustainment  Division,  for  specific  processing  procedures. AF/REG  or  NGB-GO  processes  General  Officer  OGDs  associated  with  applications  for transfer to the retired reserve. 7.6.7.1.  In  all  GO  cases  in  which  a  GO  requesting  retirement  would  be  subject  to  an OGD  in  accordance  with  paragraph  7.6.3,  the  officer’s  MAJCOM/CC  (or  equivalent) shall  notify  the  GO  that  his  case  will  result  in  the  SECAF’s  determination  of  the member’s highest grade satisfactorily held for purposes of retirement.  The member will be  notified  that  the  SecAF,  before  making  the  final  determination,  may  direct  a  formal OGD Board, or consider his case without referring it to a formal OGD Board, based on the specific incidents which mandate an OGD.  The notification shall inform the member of  the  specific  reason  for  the  OGD  and  that  the  member  may  submit  any  matters  they wish for the SecAF and/or OGD Board (if directed) to consider before the SecAF’s final AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 63 grade  determination  is  made.    After  the  officer  submits  their  acknowledgement  and matters, if any, the MAJCOM/CC (or equivalent) shall provide a written recommendation to  SecAF  as  to  the  retirement  grade.    In  all  cases  where  the  recommended  retirement grade is the current grade, the MAJCOM/CC (or equivalent) shall also recommend  that the  SecAF  either  retire  with  or  without  referral  to  a  formal  OGD  Board.    In  all  cases where  the  recommended  retirement  grade  is  in  a  lower  grade,  the  MAJCOM/CC  (or equivalent) shall also recommend that the SecAF either retire with or without referral to a formal OGD Board.  The MAJCOM/CC should use the sample memo in the PSD Guide to process the OGD recommendation in these cases and forward the case to AF/DPG for final processing. 7.6.7.2.  The  SecAF  reviews  each  General  Officer  retirement  application  to  determine whether he/she will retire the officer with or without referral to a formal OGD Board. 7.6.7.3.  The  SecAF  maintains  sole  discretion  for  determining  the  disposition  of  a General Officer OGD, with or without the advice and recommendation of SAF PC. 7.6.8.  AFPC (or AF/DPO for Colonels and Colonel-selects) serves as focal point for all other OGDs for active duty retirements.  See the PSD guide for specific processing procedures for Lt  Colonels  and  below.    Contact  AF/DPO  for  specific  processing  procedures  for  Colonels and Colonel-selects.  AF/REG or NGB/A1 processes OGDs associated with applications for transfer to the retired reserve. 7.7.    General  Information  on  Retired  Pay  Computation.  The  Defense  Finance  Accounting Service  (DFAS)  computes  retired  pay  under  the  provisions  of  the  DoD  Financial  Management Regulation  (FMR)  Volume  7B,  Military  Retired  Pay  Manual.  Questions  or  concerns  regarding retired  pay  computation  can  be  sent  to  DFAS,  US  Military  Retired  Pay,  8899  E.  56th  Street, Indianapolis, IN 46249-1200.  Table 7.1 and Table 7.2 provide some general rules for estimating retired pay of members.  7.7.1.  Reserve  (AFR/ANG)  Retired  Pay  Normally  Begins  at  Age  60.  The  entitlement  to reserve  retired  pay  begins  on  the  member’s  60th  birthday  if  the  requirements  of  10  USC §12731 are met. Retirement age may be reduced below the age of 60 by 3 months for each aggregate of 90 days of qualifying active service in a fiscal  year specified in Title 10, USC §12731(f)(2)(B).  Eligibility age may not be reduced below the age of 50. Qualifying active service must be performed after 28 January 2008.  NOTE:  By law (Title 31 USC §3702(b), commonly referred to as the Barring Act), there is a 6-year statute of limitations on receipt of reserve retired pay.  If the member does not apply by the 6th anniversary of eligibility, 1 day of reserve retired pay will be lost for each day of delay.  EXAMPLE:  If a member reached eligibility  on    January  9,  1998  and  did  not  file  the  application  for  reserve  retired  pay  until  April 1, 2004, the member is due pay only from  April 1, 1998 forward. 7.7.2.  Refer to the myPers website for active duty retired pay calculators.  Refer to the vPC website for AFR and ANG component retired pay calculators. 7.7.3.  Converting  AD  Retired  Pay  to  Reserve  Retired  Pay.      Retired  active  component members  who  complete  2  years  of  ARC    creditable  service  (minus  active  duty  days)  after completion  of  20  years  of  TAFMS    may  convert  their  AD  retired  pay  to  ARC    retired  pay 64 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 (normally at age 60) (Title 10 USC §12741). Eligible members may apply by contacting HQ ARPC Retirements. 7.7.4.  ARC officer retention beyond eligibility to receive retirement pay. 7.7.4.1.  ARC officers must apply for reserve retired pay provided they have attained the eligibility age of 60 and performed at least 20 creditable years. 7.7.4.2.  ARC  officers  cannot  be  credited  with  service  and  points  after  age  60  or completion of eligibility for reserve retired pay after age 60 without an approved waiver from SecAF or designee (Title 10 USC §12308). 7.7.4.3.  ARC officers who are not continued beyond retirement shall be transferred to the Retired Reserve (if eligible) or discharged from the officer's reserve appointment. 7.7.4.4.  Officers  may  request  SecAF  approval  for  continuance  in  service  beyond retirement eligibility up to a maximum period that does not extend beyond the Mandatory Separation Date contained in law (refer to Table 4.2). 7.7.4.5.  If an officer is approved for continuation by SecAF beyond retirement eligibility, service credit (to include points) will be awarded in accordance with 10 USC §12308. 7.7.4.6.  Unless  retired,  transferred  to  the  Retired  Reserve,  or  discharged  at  an  earlier date, an officer who received SecAF approval for retention beyond retirement eligibility will  be  separated  from  service  under  10  USC  §14515  on  the  last  day  of  the  month  in which the officer was approved for continuance. 7.8.  Re-computation  of  Retired  Pay  To  Show  Advancement  on  the  Retired  List.  An enlisted member of the Air Force who is advanced to a higher grade according to paragraph 7.4 is entitled to have retired pay re-computed on that advancement (10 USC §8992). 7.9.  Re-computation  of  Retired  Pay  To  Show  Later  Active  Duty.  If a retired member later serves on active duty (other than for training), the member is entitled to have the retired pay re- computed  to  include  the  recall  period  upon  release  from  that  duty  (see  10  USC  §1402  and §1402a.) 7.10.  Active Duty Pay Increase.  If a member voluntarily retires on the date an active duty pay increase goes into effect, they are entitled to the new rates for their retired pay (10 USC §8991 and DoD Financial Management Regulation). The only exceptions to this provision are: 7.10.1.  Officers  meeting  retirement  eligibility  (20  years  TAFMS)  anytime  during  the preceding month of the effective date of retirement may use the new rates in computing their retired pay; and 7.10.2.  Officers  who  apply  for  and  are  approved  for  a  voluntary  retirement  on  their  post-DOPMA mandatory retirement date that falls on the date of an active duty pay increase may use the new rates to estimate their retired pay. 7.11.  Retired  Pay  Increase  Due  to  Extraordinary  Heroism  (Enlisted  Only).  Active component  enlisted  members  who  had  Deeds  of  Extraordinary  Heroism  may  be  entitled  to receive  10  percent  additional  retired  pay  if  member  retires  under  10  USC  §8914  (10  USC §8991).  For Reserve Component enlisted members, payments for acts or deeds begin October 1, 2002 (10 USC §12739) although the act or deed may have occurred prior to this date. AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 65 7.11.1.  Since  regulations  require  extraordinary  heroism  as  the  criterion  for  award  of  the Medal  of  Honor  (MH),  Air  Force  Cross  (AFC),  or  equivalent  Army  or  Navy  decorations, these awards provide automatic entitlement to the additional 10 percent retirement pay (not to exceed 75 percent) for enlisted members.  If heroism is involved in the award of any other medal  to  an  enlisted  member,  SecAF  will  determine,  coincident  to  awarding  the  medal, whether or not the additional 10 percent retirement pay will be authorized. 7.11.2.  Because  the  law  is  not  restrictive  with  regard  to  the  types  of  decorations  that  may qualify an individual for this increase in retired pay, the SecAF has the authority to evaluate the  heroic  actions  that  have  earned  the  Silver  Star,  Distinguished  Flying  Cross  (DFC) (noncombat),  and  the  Airman’s  Medal  to  determine  if  extraordinary  heroism  was  involved which would entitle the recipient to the increase in retired pay. 7.11.3.  Since 1979, enlisted members who have been awarded the Silver Star, the DFC for heroism  in  a noncombat action, or the Airman's  Medal  have been  automatically  considered for the additional 10 percent retired pay increase.  If they were approved for the additional 10 percent increase in retirement pay, their special order approving the decoration will include a statement to that fact.  If an enlisted member believes consideration was not made at the time the  medal  was  awarded,  the  member  may  ask  for  a  Secretarial  decision  through  the AFBCMR process. 7.11.4.  Even  though  the  enlisted  member  qualifies  for  the  10  percent  increase,  Finance Regulations limit the total amount of retired pay to no more than 75 percent of the member's active duty basic pay at the time of retirement.   66 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 Figure 7.1.  Sample OGD Notification Memorandum to Officer. MEMORANDUM FOR MEMBER  Date   FROM: COMMANDER   ADDRESS   SUBJECT: Officer Grade Determination Notification   This memo is to inform you that the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF), or designee, will decide the grade in which you will be retired based upon determination of your satisfactory service (10 USC §1370). As indicated in AFI 36-3203, paragraph 7.2., if a commissioned officer is retiring for other than disability or non-regular service, the SAF will determine if the officer will retire in the highest grade held on active duty satisfactorily for not less than six months.   Your (misconduct) (substandard performance) (other) resulting in (see note 1) has prompted this action. The SAF, or designee, will base the decision on a review of your record of service in your current grade as well as any previously held grade in which misconduct or substandard performance is alleged (see note 2). The SAF, or designee, will also consider recommendations made through your chain of command and any comments you wish to provide.   You may seek the advice of military counsel before responding to this letter. You may make appropriate, written comments relevant to your grade determination. Your response must be returned to my office for review and endorsement within 10 calendar days from receipt of this notification memorandum.   Should you or your counsel have any questions regarding this matter, you may contact me at extension _____.   Commander's Signature/Signature Block  Attachments:   (Supporting Documentation)   1st Ind   I acknowledge receipt of notice on this date, and acknowledge that an officer grade determination is being conducted to decide in what grade I will retire. I (do) (do not) intend to consult counsel. I (do) (do not) intend to submit matters for consideration.   NOTES:  1. In this paragraph, the commander should indicate the reason for initiating the OGD, e.g., court-martial, Article 15, substandard performance, etc. Officer's Signature/Signature Block  AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 67  2. Use information from an officer’s record of service in a previously held grade if the misconduct or substandard performance began or occurred prior to promotion to the current grade but was not discovered until after promotion.     68 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 Table 7.1.  General Rules for Estimating Retired Pay of Members. Cost of Living (COLA) Full inflation protection based on Consumer Price Index (CPI)  High-3: Full inflation protection based on CPI. CSB/REDUX option: Annual COLAs of CPI minus 1% are given based upon the CPI of the High-3. Retired pay is recomputed at age 62 so that REDUX and High-3 retirement salaries are equal but REDUX COLAs for later years will continue to be CPI minus 1%    Retirement Plan Final Basic Pay High-3 High-3 or $30K Career Status Bonus (CSB)/ REDUX*  Instead of retiring under High-3, these members may choose to receive a $30K Service Bonus at 15 years of service in exchange for agreeing to serve a minimum of another 5 years and then retiring under the less generous REDUX plan    Eligible (Note 1) Entered Service prior to 8 Sep 80 Pay Formula (Notes 2, 3, and 4) 2.5% times the years of service times basic pay (see Note 5) Entered service between 8 Sep 80 and 31 Jul 86  Entered the service between 1 Aug 86 and 31 December 2017   2.5% times the years of service times the average of the highest 36 months of base pay (see Notes 6, 7 and 8)  2.5% times the years of service times the average of the highest 36 months of base pay  CSB/REDUX option: Each of the first 20 years of service is worth 2% toward the retirement multiplier. Each year after the 20th is worth 3.5%. A 30-year career is computed by 2% times 3.5% for the 10 years beyond 20, resulting in a maximum of 75%. The multiplier is applied to the average of the member’s highest 36 months of basic pay (see Notes 6, 7 and 8) Blended Retirement System (BRS) Entered the service on or after 1 Jan 18 (See Notes 9, 10, 11, and 12) 2.0% times the years of service times the average of the highest 36 months of base pay (see Notes 6, 7 and 8)   Full inflation protection based on CPI. *NOTES:  1.  “Date entered service” means the date the person is enlisted, inducted, or appointed with the AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 69 Armed Forces.  This includes persons in the Delayed Entry Program (DEP), cadets at Service Academies, officer candidates in Officer Training School (OTS), students enrolled in aReserve component in senior Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs or other financial assistance programs, students in the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and persons in the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship program.  By using “date entered service,” active component members have been “grandfathered” under the plan in effect at the time when they initially entered the service.   2.  The maximum multiplier for 30 years TAFMS is 75% times the retired pay base; however, members who serve beyond 30 years earn an additional 2.5% each additional year and can max out at 100%.   3.  The Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act allows state courts to consider retired pay as divisible property in divorce settlements.  The law does not direct state courts to divide retired pay; it simply permits them to do so.   4.  Retired pay stops upon the death of the retiree.   5.  Officers who retire and do not meet the requirements to retire in their highest grade (10 USC §1370) will be paid based on the retired grade (10 USC 1407f).  Officers retiring in an enlisted grade will have their pay calculated as determined by DFAS.   6.  Officers who retire and do not meet the requirements to retire in their highest grade (10 USC §1370) will be paid based on the last 36-month average of the time served in the higher grade and the time served in the lower grade.  EXCEPTION:  Does not apply to officers who did not serve satisfactorily in the highest grade and such determination is the result of conduct occurring after October 30, 2000 (See Note 5).   7.  Enlisted members demoted to a lower grade within 3 years and retired in that grade will not be paid based on high 36-month average in the higher grades.  Their retired pay will be based on “final basic pay” instead of either the high 36-month average or REDUX formulas.  When an enlisted member’s active service added to retired list service totals 30 years, the member may be advanced (on the retired list) and receive retired pay in the highest grade satisfactorily held on active duty, as determined by the SecAF or designee (10 USC §8964).   8.  Officers who resigned their commissions  and retire in  enlisted status  will have their  retired pay calculated IAW 10 USC §1407e.  DFAS will calculate the High-36 month average as if the member held the retired grade the last 36 months of active service.  *9.    Members  entering  the  service  prior  to  1  January  2018,  who  have  less  than  12  years  of service  (calculated  from  the  pay  date)  or  less  than  4,320  retirement  points  (for  reserve component members) as of 31 December 2017, may enroll in the BRS.    *10.    Members  in  the  Delayed  Entry  Program  (DEP),  cadets  at  Service  Academies,  officer candidates  in  Officer  Training  School  (OTS),  students  enrolled  in  a  Reserve  component  in senior Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs, entering the service prior to 1 January 70 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 2018,  may  enroll  in  the  BRS  following  commissioning/accession  into  active  duty.    Members commissioned  or  accessed  into  active  duty  after  2  December  2018  have  30  days  from commissioning/entry into active duty to enroll in the BRS.    *11.  Members with breaks in service reentering active duty or the Selected Reserve on or after 1 January 2019, who originally entered the service prior to 1 January 2018, and have less than 12 years  of  service  (calculated  from  the  pay  date)  or  less  than  4,320  retirement  points  for  reserve component members as of reentry, may enroll in the BRS within 30 days of reentry.   *12.  Members enrolled in the BRS will have a Thrift Savings Plan established that includes automatic and matching government contributions.  DoD begins an automatic contribution of one percent of base pay after 60 days of service (calculated from pay date).  DoD begins matching contributions up to an additional four percent of base pay after 2 years of service (calculated from pay date).  Automatic and matching contributions continue until the member separates, retires or completes 26 years of service (calculated from pay date).  For members enrolling in BRS as outlined in notes 9 through 11, government contributions begin the pay period following enrollment.    AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 71 Table 7.2.  Computing Years of Service and Retired Pay of Reserve Members Retiring Under 10 USC §12731.  S T  E P  1  A   To compute  Years of service and any fraction of a year  B     Take these steps  Add each day of active duty, including active duty for training prior to  July 1, 1949  Add each year before July 1, 1949 at the rate of 50 calendar days per year and proportionately for each fraction of a year. Exclude active duty credited in step 1.  Credit service in a Reserve component of an armed force, in the Army, or the Air Force without component, or in any other category covered in 10 USC §12732(a)(1), (3), and (4).  (To obtain proportionate year point totals, add the periods, day for day, and divide the product by 7.3.)  After 1 Jul 1949, add active duty points, points for inactive duty training and membership points according to Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 36-8001.  Credit inactive duty points up to a maximum of 60 points in any year including membership.  For Retention/Retirement (R/R) years closing out on or after September 23, 1996 but before October 30, 2000, credit up to a maximum of 75 inactive duty points which includes membership points, and credit up to a maximum of 90 inactive duty points which includes membership points for R/R years closing on or after October 30, 2000, but before October 30, 2007. Credit up to a maximum of 130 points for R/R years closing on or after  October 30, 2007  Divide the sum of steps 1, 2, and 3 above by 360; carry the quotient to three decimal places; and round off to two decimal places.  EXAMPLE:  4734 divided by 360 = 13.150 or 13.15  Multiply the result of step 4 by 2.5% (.025); round off the product to four decimal places.  EXAMPLE: 13.15 x .025 = .32875 or .3288  2  3  4  5  Retired pay 72  6 AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015  For members who have a DIEMS/DIEUS date prior to 8 Sep 1980, use current active duty basic pay charts at the time granted such pay, determine the monthly active duty basic pay in effect that the member would receive if serving in the active component in their highest temporary or permanent grade satisfactorily held during the entire period of service.    Multiply by the product of step 5 to determine monthly retired pay.  EXAMPLE: Basic pay $885.00 x .3288 = $290.99, rounded down to $290. (All gross pay is rounded down to the nearest dollar amount)  AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 73 Chapter 8 TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT OF RESERVE COMPONENT MEMBERS TO THE RETIRED RESERVE 8.1.  Retired  Reserve.  The  Retired  Reserve  consists  of  members  who  have  completed  the service  required  for  a  non-regular  retirement  and  is  transferred  or  assigned  under  10  USC §10154,  Retired  Reserve  and  DoD  Instruction  (DoDI)  1200.15,  Assignment  to  and  Transfer Between  Reserve  Categories,  Discharge  from  Reserve  Status,  Transfer  to  the  Retired  Reserve and Notification of Eligibility for Retired Pay.  These members may also be commonly referred to  as  “grey  area  retirees”  or  “reserve  retirees  awaiting  reserve  retired  pay  normally  at  age  60.”  This chapter applies primarily to members who qualify for a reserve retirement only.  Also refer to Chapter 5. 8.2.  Ordering to Active Duty Members in the Retired Reserve.  Anytime the AF finds a valid requirement  for  the  member’s  service,  the  AF  may  order  to  AD  (with  member’s  consent)  a member transferred or assigned to the Retired Reserve, or retain a member on Active Duty (AD).  The SecAF, with the approval of the Secretary of Defense, may order a member to involuntary AD service who has completed 20 years active military service and retired under 10 USC §8911 or §8914 if leadership decides that insufficient reservists remain available in an active status with the needed skills (10 USC §12301, §12302, §12305, §12306, §688). 8.3.  Former  Members.  A  former  member  is  an  individual  who  qualified  for  retirement  but elected  not  to  transfer  to  the  Retired  Reserve  and  was  subsequently  discharged  for  physical disqualification,  misconduct,  upon  expiration  of  their  contract,  or  resigned  their  commission.  These  members  have  no  military  status  but  are  authorized  certain  entitlements  and  benefits according to AFI 36-3026 (I). 8.4.  Categories of Personnel Who Are Eligible for Transfer to the Retired Reserve. 8.4.1.  Transfer to the Retired Reserve is automatic for: 8.4.1.1.  ARC officers who are retired for service under 10 USC §8911, 20 years or more Regular or Reserve commissioned officers. 8.4.1.2.  ARC  members  retired  for  disability  under  10  USC  Chapter  61,  Retirement  or Separation for Physical Disability. 8.4.1.3.

Grade  in  the  Retired  Reserve  .  Officers  Promoted  under  ROPMA  must  meet  specific Time-in-Grade Requirements (TIG). 8.9.1.  Time  in  Grade  at  Age  60.    If  a  member  has  a  MSD  that is  established  at  age  62  (or later) and decides not to remain until their MSD and applies for reserve retired pay at age 60, it  is  considered  a  voluntary  retirement  and  the  TIG  for  Lt  Col  and  Col  is  three  years creditable service in grade. 8.9.2.

Time in grade requirement is reduced to 6 months if the officer is involuntarily separated from  active status  due to  age or  years of service.

The commander must notify the officer in writing when an OGD is being initiated and why  (refer  to  Section  I  of  the  PSD  Guide  for  conditions  that  warrant  an  OGD)  (T-0).    The AFI36-3203  18 SEPTEMBER 2015 77 officer  is  normally  given  10-calendar  days  to  submit  comments  on  his  or  her  behalf.  Upon receipt of officer’s comments (if provided), the commander will make a recommendation in writing regarding the officer’s retirement  grade (T-1).  The retirement  application, officer’s comments  (if  provided),  commander’s  retirement  grade  recommendation,  and  supporting documentation  (i.e.,  court-martial  package,  civil  court  conviction  package,  Article  15,  etc.) are  processed  through  command  channels  to  SecAF  for  retirement  grade  decision.    After making the OGD, SecAF will send a decision memorandum to HQ ARPC Retirements. 8.9.6.  Enlisted Retired Grades. Enlisted members who retire with a Reserve retirement, other than  for  physical  disability,  retire  in  their  current  grade.  If  a  member  at  retirement  holds  a grade lower than one previously held, a determination of highest grade held satisfactorily is required  unless  the  member  satisfactorily  held  a  higher  grade  than  the  current  retirement. SecAF  has  delegated  this  authority  to  HQ  ARPC.  The  SecAF  is  required  to  approve  any grade lower than the highest grade held. 8.10.  Entitlements and Benefits. 8.10.1.

duty  in  the  active  military  service  of  the  United  States,  and  includes full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance, while in the active military service,  at  a  school  designated  as  a  service  school  by  law  or  by  the  Secretary  of  the  military department  concerned.    Such  term  does  not  include  full-time  National  Guard  duty  (10  USC §101(d)(1)). Active  Duty  for  Training  (ADT)—A  tour  of  active  duty  used  for  training  members  of  the Reserve Components to provide trained units and qualified persons to fill the needs of the Armed Forces in time of war or national emergency and other such times as national security requires.  The  AF  places  the  member  on  orders,  which  provide  for  return  to  inactive  status  when  the member  completes  the  period  of  active  duty  for  training.    It  includes  annual  training,  special tours of active duty for training, school tours, and the initial duty for training performed by non-prior service enlistees. Active  Military  Service—A general term that includes Regular officers on the active duty list, Regular Airmen, and Reserve Component members serving on extended active duty. Active  Status—Means  the  status  of  a  member  of  a  reserve  component,  not  serving  in  the inactive Army National Guard or inactive Air National Guard, on an inactive status list, or in the Retired Reserve (10 USC §101(d)(4)).

For ARC tours, strength accountability for persons on extended active duty changes from the ARC to the active force.  The AF does not count ADT and active duty in a service academy or armed forces preparatory school as creditable extended active duty service. Hardship—A  fully-documented  situation  or  circumstance  that  imposes  undue  privation  or suffering  on  the  member,  household,  or  immediate  family  and  has  occurred  since  the  member applied for retirement. The AF does not consider circumstances common among retirement-eligible members, such as employment prospects or school year considerations, as hardship.  This term does not relate to humanitarian deferment policies in AFI 36-2110, Assignments.  The AF uses this definition of hardship when considering waiving the retirement restrictions identified in Table 2.2, allowing members to withdraw or extend retirements, or extending members’ HYT dates.
