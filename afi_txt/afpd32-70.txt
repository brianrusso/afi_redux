BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE Template modified:27 May 1997 14:30 3.3. Conservation. The Air Force will conserve natural and cultural resources through effectiveenvironmental planning.  The environmental consequences of proposed actions and reasonable alter-natives will be integrated into all levels of decision making.  The environmental resources under AirForce stewardship will be protected and managed in the public interest.  Environmental opportunitiesand constraints will be the foundation of comprehensive plans for installation development.3.4. Pollution Prevention. The Air Force will prevent future pollution by reducing use of hazardousmaterials and releases of pollutants into the environment to as near zero as feasible.  This will be donefirst through source reduction, e.g. chemical substitution, process change and other techniques.Where environmentally damaging materials must  be  used,  their use will be minimized. When theuse of hazardous materials cannot be avoided, the spent material and waste will be reused or recycledwhenever possible.  When spent material and waste cannot be reused or recycled, dispose of the spentmaterial and waste as a last resort in an environmentally safe manner, consistent with the requirementsof all applicable laws.  Environmental costs will be accounted for in computing hazardous materiallife-cycle costs.4. The Air Force will seek sufficient funding to carry out all environmental activities needed to meet itslegal obligations.  All funds appropriated by the Congress for these activities will be administered respon-sibly.5. This directive establishes the following authorities and responsibilities:5.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations and Envi-ronment (SAF/MI) is responsible for environmental protection policy matters as described in AFPD90-1, Strategic Planning and Policy Formulation, 5.2.paragraph 1.5.2.5.2. The Civil Engineer (HQ USAF/CE) formulates policy, oversees its execution, and issues essen-tial guidance.5.3. The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence and the Air Force Civil Engineering SupportAgency provide technical and contracting support to implement these policies.5.4. The National Guard Bureau and Headquarters Air Force Reserve advocate and oversee theirenvironmental protection program, reporting to HQ USAF/CE or SAF/MI as appropriate.5.5. Commanders of major commands (MAJCOM) and lower echelons develop and execute pro-grams to comply with these policies.6. See Attachment 1 for the measures of compliance.7. See Attachment 2 for terms used in this directive.8. See Attachment 3 for the directives and laws associated with this directive.29. See Attachment 4 for publications that interface with this directive.JAMES E. McCARTHY,  Maj General, USAFThe Civil Engineer3Attachment 1MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS POLICYA1.1. Compliance with this policy will be measured at each base and reported through the MAJCOM tothe Headquarters US Air Force Civil Engineer Directorate of Environmental Quality on the Work Infor-mation Management System--Environmental Subsystem as prescribed in AFI 32-7002, EnvironmentalInformation Management System and AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program in Foreign Countries.A1.2. Cleanup. For locations in the United States, its territories, and possessions, adherence to thecleanup policy will be assessed by measuring the percentage of sites in the high risk, medium risk, lowrisk, or no further action planned categories ( Figure A1.1.).A1.3. Environmental Compliance. Adherence to the environmental compliance policy will be assessedby measuring the current total number of open enforcement actions ( Figure A1.2.).A1.4. Conservation. Adherence to the conservation policy will be assessed by measuring the percentageof installations that have updated complete comprehensive plans ( Figure A1.3.).  A complete compre-hensive plan includes (1) environmental constraints such as natural and cultural resource areas and instal-lation restoration program sites, (2) existing infrastructure such as mainline utilities, roads, and facilities,(3) a land use plan for future development, and (4) a capital improvements plan.A1.5. Pollution Prevention. Adherence to the pollution prevention policy will be assessed by measuringthe amount of hazardous wastes ( Figure A1.4.) and solid wastes ( Figure A1.5.) sent off installation todisposal, and those numbers compared to the respective values for the baseline year ( CY 92).4Figure A1.1.

This includes warning letters as determined by theRegional Compliance Office.  In foreign countries, an enforcement action is a written notice from a hostnation regulatory authority; however, the cited conditions must also be out of compliance with the DoDFinal Governing Standards (or Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document), or identifycontamination posing an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and safety.Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document.—Implementation guidance, procedures andcriteria for environmental compliance at DoD installations in foreign countries.  This document is used todevelop Final Governing Standards and, in the case where no Final Governing Standards exist, providesthe compliance criteria for use by the Air Force.9Attachment 3DIRECTIVES AND LAWS IMPLEMENTED BY THIS POLICYA3.1.
