Air Force Civilian Mobility Program. A mobility program allows management to readily identify and move employees to meet critical needs and to provide assignments designed to give them the breadth and depth of experience needed for placement in positions to enhance career progression, improve mission effectiveness, or otherwise meet the needs of the AF.  Mobility may be organizational or geographic.  Organizational mobility occurs within or among organizations or organizational levels within the local area of consideration and requires a Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) but may or may not require a mobility agreement.  Geographic mobility occurs when a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) is necessary, and a mobility agreement may be required.    (Add): 1.1. Career Mobility.  Effective force development depends upon filling high-level positions with highly qualified employees who have a variety of work experiences.  This experience may be acquired at various geographic locations throughout the AF or at organizations or organizational levels in the same geographic area.  These varied experiences provide employees a range of challenges and demands that may not be experienced in a single type of position or at only one installation or organizational level.  The career-minded employee should seek such work experiences in more than one organization or location in a lifetime career.  This depth and breadth of experience may be the factor that makes an employee the best qualified for advancement.  (Add): 1.1.1.  De-emphasis on Geographic Mobility.  Breadth and depth of experience are among the most relevant criteria for selections in civilian hiring and promotions. Therefore, instead of hiring based on the employee’s record of geographic mobility, selecting officials will evaluate employee history based on the positions held and expertise developed in each position, regardless of the position’s geographic location.  Prior geographic mobility will not be a selection factor for hiring and promotions.   (Add) 1.1.2. Mobility Following Development Programs.  A willingness to be geographically mobile in the future may be a prerequisite for selection to developmental programs.  (Replace): 2. Applicability. The Air Force expects the following employees to be mobile:  • Selected employees as determined by:    • The Civilian Force Development Panel (CFDP) for positions included in Air Force-wide career programs, or       • The Air Force- or Secretariat-level functional chief for other occupations or career fields,   or       • Other employees as explained in paragraph 3.1. below.    AFI36-202_AFGM2017-01  AFI 36-202_AFGM2016-01 Attachment  3 3. Management Responsibilities.  (Replace): 3.1. Assignments requiring organizational or geographic relocation, except for those done at employee request and those resulting from reduction-in-force or transfer of function, are subject to this instruction if a mobility agreement is required.  (Replace): 3.2. HQ USAF or Secretariat organizations, major commands (MAJCOMs), Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC), field operating agencies (FOA), or civilian career fields may create mobility programs (initiating organizations) as part of intern or formal career development programs, to improve mission effectiveness, or to meet specific mission needs. The Air Force Director of Civilian Force Management (AF/A1C) and the initiating organization develop and implement mobility program procedures.  (Add): 3.3. Positions covered are to be clearly identified by type and level in the mobility program’s enabling document. Civilian mobility programs shall generally be confined to administrative, professional, technical, and managerial positions.  (Replace): 3.4. Management officials must keep employees fully informed of the contents of this instruction, mobility programs and coverage, and of the benefits to the Air Force and its employees of planned assignment changes.  4. Program Requirements:  (Replace): 4.1. Initiating organizations must clearly inform candidates for positions of the details and operations of a program before assignment, including whether mobility may be a condition of employment or selection and if a mobility agreement is required. They must also ensure that the position's job announcement includes a statement regarding any mobility requirement. Refer to the attached sample Mobility Agreement and to AFMAN 36-606, Civilian Career Field Management and Development.  (Replace): 4.2. The initiating organization decides if mobility agreements must be signed as a condition of employment for a position. Mobility agreements are in effect for the length of an assignment or internship or other temporary circumstance as determined by the initiating organization. The requirement for a mobility agreement for other than intern or developmental positions must be justified by mission requirements.  (Add): 4.2.1. Civilian mobility programs that are part of career development programs shall not normally require more than two relocations of an employee between initial assignment and completion of the formal training for placement at the target or full performance level in the career field.  Other civilian mobility programs, e.g., those requiring periodic rotation of employees, shall not require relocations of covered employees more frequently than once every two years unless deviation is required by contract expiration or otherwise established limitations on the duration of tours of duty for an area.  However, temporary duty assignments, i.e., for formal training or for meeting emergency or other mission essential needs, may be required.     AFI 36-202_AFGM2016-01 Attachment   AFI36-202_AFGM2017-01  24 APROL 2017 4  (Add): 4.3. If employees occupy positions subsequently identified for mobility, they need not sign a mobility agreement to keep their jobs. These employees continue to be considered for reassignments or promotions to vacancies at their present location.  (Replace): 6. Involuntary Mobility Assignment without a Mobility Agreement. The Secretary of the Air Force delegates the authority to approve or direct involuntary assignments to the career program policy council chair (Auditor General co-chair in the case of the Air Force Audit Agency) for those occupations managed by the career fields or to the Air Force or Secretariat-level functional chief for those occupations not managed by career fields.

It applies to certain administrative, professional, technical, and managerial positions.  Itdoes not apply to movement of Senior Executive Service members, employees assigned to U.S. Air ForceReserve, or Air National Guard technician positions.SUMMARY OF REVISIONSThis is the first publication of AFI 36-202, substantially revising AFR 40-303.  This revision aligns theinstruction with AFPD 36-2.1. Air Force Civilian Mobility Program. A mobility program allows management to readily identifyand move employees to meet critical needs and to provide assignments designed to give them the breadthand depth of experience needed for placement in key managerial positions.2. Applicability. The Air Force expects the following employees to be mobile:• All GS/GM-15s.• All, or selected, GS/GM-14s as determined by:• The  career  program  policy  council  for  occupations  included  in  Air  Force-wide  career  pro-grams, or• The Air Force or Secretariat-level functional chief for other occupations or career fields.• Other employees as explained in paragraph 3.1. below.2.1. These senior civilian employees are managed either by the civilian career programs or the AirForce-level functional chiefs.3. Management Responsibilities. The Secretary of the Air Force manages all Air Force resources and,as such, has the authority to require mobility and to establish civilian mobility programs.3.1. Assignments involving geographic relocation, except for those done at employee request andthose resulting from reduction-in-force or transfer of function, are subject to this instruction.3.2. HQ USAF or Secretariat organizations, major commands (MAJCOM), field operating agencies(FOA), or civilian career program policy councils may create mobility programs (initiating organiza-tions) as part of intern or formal career development programs, to improve mission effectiveness, or tomeet specific mission needs.  The Air Force Director of Civilian Personnel and Personnel Plans (HQUSAF/DPC) and the initiating organization develop and implement mobility program procedures.3.3. Management officials must keep employees fully informed of the contents of this instruction,mobility programs and coverage, and of the benefits to the Air Force and its employees of plannedassignment changes.4. Program Requirements:4.1. Initiating organizations must inform candidates for positions of the details and operations of aprogram before assignment, including whether mobility may be a condition of employment or selec-tion and if a mobility agreement is required.  (See Attachment 1 for a sample agreement.)4.2. The initiating organization decides if mobility agreements must be signed as a condition of selec-tion for a position. Mobility agreements are in effect for the employee’s entire Air Force career, thelength of an assignment or internship, or other temporary circumstance as determined by the initiatingorganization.4.3. If employees occupy positions subsequently identified for mobility, they need not sign a mobilityagreement to keep their jobs.  These employees continue to be considered for promotions to vacanciesat their present location.4.4. Management officials should consider an employee’s career objectives and geographic prefer-ences in determining assignments requiring relocation, however, an employee’s personal preference isnot binding upon management.4.5. Mobility programs enhance career progression or mission effectiveness.  They are not a form ofdisciplinary action.5. Assignment with a Mobility Agreement. Individuals with a  mobility agreement may request releasefrom the mobility requirement only for hardship.  The career program policy chair, Air Force or Secretar-iat-level functional manager, commander, or individual responsible for the mobility program decideswhether to release the individual from the mobility agreement.  If a hardship exemption is not approved,management’s options are to reassign the employee to a position not requiring mobility, remove theemployee from the program, or separate the employee from Federal service.  (Employees who havesigned a mobility agreement or have their position description annotated to identify a mobility require-ment before assignment into the position are ineligible for discontinued service retirement).26. Involuntary Mobility Assignment without a Mobility Agreement. The Secretary of the Air Forcedelegates the authority to approve or direct involuntary assignments to the career program policy councilchair (Auditor General co-chair in the case of the Air Force Audit Agency) for those occupations man-aged by the career programs or to the Air Force or Secretariat-level functional chief for those occupationsnot managed by career programs.6.1. Approval requires that such action is in the best interest of the Air Force and warrants overridingthe personal consideration of the employee.  Examples of actions in the best interest of the Air Forceinclude mission essentiality or the unique qualifications of the individual.6.2. Send requests for an involuntary assignment with a geographic move through the MAJCOM andHQ USAF/DPC.  Include the following supporting documentation:6.2.1. Position description and organization chart.6.2.2. Employee’s statement of inability or reluctance to move voluntarily with validating com-ments by supervisors.6.2.3. Statement from Air Force or Secretariat-level functional chief, career program policy coun-cil chair, or other managers describing the special qualifications of the employee, the reasonswhich make the assignment imperative, and the effects on the mission.7. Documentation. The gaining organization initiates the SF-52, Request for Personnel Action, effect-ing the mobility assignment.  The Civilian Personnel Flight of the gaining organization retains all support-ing documentation.8. Appeals and Grievances. Employees may request review of the decision under the appropriateagency dispute resolution and grievance procedure or negotiated grievance procedure.BILLY J. BOLES,  Lt General, USAFDCS/Personnel3Attachment 1MOBILITY AGREEMENT FOR GS/GM-14/15A1.1. The Air Force often needs to reassign the best qualified senior civilian employees to meet criticalneeds or to provide employees opportunities for continued career progression.  Selection for a GS/GM-14or 15 position requiring mobility recognizes an individual’s skill, capability, and potential for senior levelpositions.A1.2. I agree for the duration of my employment with the Air Force to accept positions at the same orhigher grade, including an assignment to different geographic locations, to satisfy my obligation underthis agreement.A1.3. I understand my personal career goals and geographic and assignment preferences will be consid-ered but are not guaranteed.  Management will consider compelling personal reasons for not accepting anassignment, but the Air Force may still require me to relocate to meet Air Force needs.A1.4. If I do not accept a mobility assignment, even if relocation is not required, I may be reassigned toanother position not requiring mobility, lose consideration for career development or enhancementassignments or key managerial positions, or may face adverse action such as change to lower grade orseparation.Employee’s Signature and DateCivilian Personnel Flight Representative’sSignature and Date4
