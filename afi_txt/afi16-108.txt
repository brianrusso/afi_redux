Countries  nominated  to  receive  ALP  scholarships  are  prioritized  by  a board chaired by SAF/IAPX in accordance with SAF/IA Operating Instruction 16-2. 7.2.  Key Considerations. 7.2.1.  Combatant  Command  prioritized  nominations  (resulting  from  SAF/IAPX  annual call for nominations). 7.2.2.  Board  inputs  and  recommendations  (i.e.,  SAF/IA  regional  divisions,  AF/A5XX, CSAF Political Advisor). 7.2.3.  Supporting considerations and rationale.  Amongst eligible countries with similar engagement priorities, consider the following factors: 7.2.3.1.  Foreign air force capability to effectively use ALP candidate (i.e., likelihood of appropriate follow on assignment in country’s air force). 7.2.3.2.  Foreign air force budget.  A country with sufficient cash to purchase modern aircraft systems and flying training should not be considered as a high priority for this USAF program. 7.2.3.3.  Existing  grant  programs.    A  country  receiving  small  US  grant  programs should have priority over larger US grant recipients. 7.2.3.4.  Existing  security  cooperation  programs.    A  country  with  which  the  USAF has  few  people-to-people  programs  or  initiatives  (i.e.,  training  programs,  Personnel Exchange Program, military-to-military contacts) should have priority over countries with which the USAF has many programs. 7.2.3.5.  History of attendance.  Every effort should be made to ensure distribution of ALP scholarships to maximize the engagement potential of the ALP. 7.2.3.6.  Number  of  quotas.    Unless  supporting  rationale  and  justification  warrants additional quotas, only one ALP quota is allocated per country.  CSAF must approve multiple  quotas,  and  the  justification  provided  must  meet  security  cooperation objectives.  AFI16-108  17 AUGUST, 2015   5  8.  ALP  Candidate  Criteria.  To  achieve  program  goals,  the  USAF  encourages  use  of  the following criteria to choose ALP candidates: 8.1.  An  ALP  candidate  should  be  a  top  graduate  of  the  participating  country’s  air  force academy or other young officer with potential to achieve top leadership positions in their air force. 8.2.  The USAF will accept second or third-year cadets on a case-by-case basis, provided the cadet is considered a member of the country’s air force and has a service commitment upon graduation from the academy. 8.3.  The  USAF  considers  participation  of  foreign  graduates  of  the  USAF  Academy  on  a case-by-case basis. 9.  Program Administration.  ALP students are administered the same as International Military Education  and  Training  (IMET)  students  IAW  AFI  16-105,  except  that  costs  for  ALP  students are charged to USAF appropriations. 9.1.  Medical Standards.  Medical standards for flying in USAF aircraft are to be IAW AFI 16-105  with  further  guidance  as  outlined  in  AFI  48-123,  Medical  Examinations  and Standards. 9.2.  Language  Training.  As stated in  para 5.1  above, the ALP includes English language training.    ALP  candidates  must  meet  established  language  capability  requirements  before beginning aviation training.  Language pre-requisites established by AETC are currently 85 English Comprehension Level and Oral Proficiency Interview score of 2+/2+. 9.3.  Per  Diem,  Billeting,  Food,  and  Health  Services.  Benefits  and  allowances  are  IAW AFI 16-105 for IMET students; however, all charges are to USAF appropriated funds. 9.4.  Dependents.  As  stated  in  AFI  16-105  and  ALP  agreements,  international  military students are encouraged not to bring dependents to the US during their training period.  ALP student dependents are considered unauthorized dependents IAW AFI 16-105.  HEIDI H.
