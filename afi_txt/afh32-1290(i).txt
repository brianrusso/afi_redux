1OPERATION OF CATHODICPROTECTION SYSTEMS1.1.   Maintaining  Cathodic  Protection  Systems  requires  periodic  (recurring)maintenance to ensure proper operation.  The required surveys and intervalsare identified in MIL HDBK 1136, Operation and Maintenance of CathodicProtection Systems.1.2.    The  Close  Interval  Corrosion  Survey  is  conducted  to  ensure  that  theentire structure has adequate cathodic protection.1.2.1.  Preferred  equipment:  Data  Logger,  Current (orSyncronizable  Current  Interrupters  for  impressed  current  systems  withmultiple  rectifiers),  low  frequency  pipe  locator  (120-cps  for  impressedcurrent systems), motorized wire  wheel  or  wire  dispenser  (backpack  or hippack) and data probe with copper/copper sulfate electrode (figure 1.1).Interrupters Figure 1.1.  Using Data Logger for Close Interval Survey.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199961.2.1.1.  Other  equipment  which  may  be  used  includes  waveform  analyzerswith  pulse  generators  (for  impressed  current  systems  with  one  to  11rectifiers),  or  high  input  resistant  DC  voltmeter  (10  megaohms  or  higher),wire  reels,  intermediate  electrode  extension,  and  copper/copper  sulfateelectrode.1.2.2.  Check  serviceability  of  reference  electrode  (half-cell),  meters,  meterleads, wire reels, and other equipment.1.2.3.  A  systematic approach  should  be  taken  to  cover  the  entire  structurewith high accuracy for recording locations of potential measurements taken(table 1.1).1.2.4.  Take required potential measurements.1.2.4.1.  "On"  and  "instant  off"  potential  measurements  must  be  taken  atintervals not to exceed the depth of the pipeline or structure being tested.1.2.4.2.  Normally, the interval used is kept uniform over the entire structure.1.2.4.2.1.  Take accurate notes to record location information.1.2.4.2.2.  Use  pipe locator to  ensure measurements  are  taken  directly  overpipelines (figure 1.2).1.2.5.  Locations of all physical structures should be noted, especially whenpotential  readings  can’t  be  taken  due  to  asphalt  or  other  physicalobstructions.1.2.5.1.  Note  exact  length  of  the  structure  where  potential  measurementswere not taken.1.2.5.2.  Locations  to  be  noted  may  include  roads,  sidewalks,  railroads,valves,  pits,  buildings,  ditches,  retaining  walls,  foreign  pipeline  crossings,AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 19997test  stations,  fences,  parking  lots,  waterways,  or  other  significant  location,such as where the structure comes out of the ground for any reason.Table 1.1.

Using  Pipe  Locator  to  Make  Measurements  Directly  OverPipeline.1.2.6.  Note location of structure connection for all potential measurements.1.2.6.1.  When  the  structure  connection  location  is  changed,  it  must  berecorded in the data, and a portion of previous readings should be duplicatedto ensure consistency of data (and continuity of the structure).1.2.6.2.  If  instant  off  potential  measurements  are  exactly  the  same  aftermoving the structure connection, this may not be required.1.2.6.3.  If  instant  off  potential  measurements  change  significantly  whenmoving the structure connection, more potentials may need to be taken.1.2.6.4.  This condition should be noted in the data, so that the location canbe re-visited for future testing and troubleshooting.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199991.2.7.  Potentials should also be taken on foreign metallic structures, whichcross or are located near the protected structure, especially when a gradient isobserved on the protected structure.1.2.8.  Data  should  be  entered  into  a  computer  database  and  checked  forerroneous readings.1.2.8.1.  Erroneous readings can result from not making good contact to earthwith the reference cell, lifting the reference cell too early or by pressing thetrigger too early.1.2.8.2.  All  data  should  be  reviewed  for  errors  when  entered  into  thedatabase.1.2.9.  Graphing  Data:  After  verification  of  the  data,  the  data  should  begraphed  by  data  base  software  or  by  copying  the  data  into  a  spreadsheetapplication.  This graphical presentation of the data allows for easy analysis.1.2.10.  Analyzing  Data:    Presenting  the  data  graphically  allows  overlay  ofcriteria lines or  curves,  which  easily  identifies  areas  which do not  meet thecriteria for protection.1.2.10.1.  Other anomalies in the data are also easily recognized.1.2.10.2.  Trends,  which  may  not  have  been  apparent  when  looking  at  thepotential measurements, will be readily seen on the graphs.1.2.10.3.  Looking at the graph of the data may uncover areas of the structurewhere further testing or troubleshooting is required.1.2.10.4.  The data may also be overlaid with previous survey data or futuresurvey data to allow easy recognition of changes or other anomalies.1.2.11.  Other tests required include anode and rectifier checks shown in table1.2 (these requirements are detailed in MIL HDBK 1136).AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199910Table 1.2.

The Corrosion Survey is conducted to reasonably ensure that the entirestructure still has adequate cathodic protection.1.3.1.  Preferred  Equipment:  Data  Logger,  Current (orSyncronizable  Current  Interrupters  for  impressed  current  systems  withmultiple rectifiers), motorized wire wheel or wire dispenser (backpack or hippack) and data probe with copper/copper sulfate electrode (figure 1.3).  Otherequipment  which  may  be  used  includes  waveform  analyzers  with  pulsegenerators (for impressed current systems with one to 11 rectifiers), or highinput  resistant  DC  voltmeter  (10  megaohms  or  higher),  wire  reels,intermediate electrode extension, and copper/ copper sulfate electrode.Interrupters Figure 1.3.  Synchronizing Current Interrupters.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999111.3.2.  Check  serviceability  of  reference  electrode  (half-cell),  meters,  meterleads, wire reels, and other equipment.1.3.3.  Take required potential measurements.1.3.3.1.  Data from the close interval corrosion survey should be analyzed todetermine the best locations for data collection during the corrosion survey.1.3.3.2.  This  is  normally  the  low  and/or  the  high  potential  locations,according to the trends in that data.1.3.3.3.  If a close interval survey has never been  done,  it  would  be  wise  toperform the close interval survey in lieu of the corrosion survey.1.3.3.4.  "On" and "instant off" potential measurements must be taken.  If datafrom  a  close  interval  corrosion  survey  is  not  available,  sufficient  testlocations should be selected to ensure that the entire structure is protected.1.3.3.5.  See table 1.3 for general recommendations of potential locations.1.3.4.  Take accurate notes to record location information.1.3.5.  Examine all data collected to ensure erroneous potential measurementsare not included in the database.1.3.6.  Compare measurements to previously recorded data.1.3.7.  Other tests required include anode and rectifier checks shown in table1.4.  These requirements are detailed in MIL HDBK 1136.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199912Table 1.3.

Ensure submersible adapter, or that it is a water tank reference electrode.that  reference  electrode  connection  is  made  with  a1.4.2.2.  Exposure  of  the  copper  connection  to  the  water  will  result  inerroneous measurements.1.4.3.  Take required potential measurements.1.4.3.1.  "On"  and  "instant  off"  potential  measurements  should  be  taken  ofthe  tank  wall,  at  the  surface,  midway  down  the  tank,  and  at  the  bottom,adjacent to and between all anode strings.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999141.4.3.2.  The tank bottom should have potential measurements taken directlybelow  tank  wall  anode  strings,  stub  anode  strings,  and  between  the  anodestrings.1.4.3.3.  For elevated towers with "wet"  risers,  close  interval  measurementsshould be taken near the riser wall for the entire length of the riser (normallyevery 2 to 5 feet).1.4.4.  Take accurate notes to record location information.1.5.  The rectifier operational checkout is used to ascertain the serviceabilityof  all  the  components  necessary  to  impress  current  to  the  anodes  of  theimpressed current system.1.5.1.  It  should  be  a thorough  checkout  to  ensure  dependable  current  untilthe next inspection.1.5.2.  This checkout should be  accomplished in  conjunction  with  the  closeinterval corrosion survey, the corrosion survey, the water tank calibration, orwhen any inspection or survey indicates that problems with the rectifier mayexist.1.5.3.  Preferred Equipment: Handheld multimeter with AC, DC, ohms, anddiode circuits and suitable test leads.1.5.4.  The  rectifier  operational  checkout  should  include  the  following:Visual  check  of  all  rectifier  components,  shunt  box  components,  safetyswitches, circuit breakers and other system power components.1.5.4.1.

In galvanic systems, troubleshooting from the test stations (anddielectrics on isolated systems) will identify the component that has failed.2.1.5.  Impressed  current  systems  have  a  large  number  of  components  thatmay fail.2.1.6.  Galvanic systems are normally trouble free, until anode life has beenreached.2.2.    Troubleshooting  Impressed  Current  CP  Systems  begins  at  the  powersource, normally a rectifier.  For automatic rectifiers, see paragraph 2.2.20.2.2.1.  Visually check rectifier for abnormal conditions.2.2.2.  Measure the DC voltage output (Negative to Positive terminals).AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999242.2.3.  Measure  the  DC  current  output  of  the  rectifier  using  one  of  thefollowing methods (in order of accuracy):2.2.3.1.  Using a clamp-on direct current milliammeter.2.2.3.2.  Measuring  MV  drop across  a  calibrated  shunt  with  multimeter  seton mV and multiplying by the proper multiplier (see table 2.1).Table 2.1.

Disconnect positive (anode) lead and using an ammeter in series.2.2.5.  Compare  those  measurements  to  previous  readings  taken  duringnormal operation.2.2.6.  Categorize the readings as high, normal, half of normal, low, or at ornear zero.2.2.7.  Use  table  2.2  to  determine  possible  problems  and  take  the  actionsrequired to isolate the problem.2.2.8.  Loss  of  structure  isolation  is  the  most  common  reason  of  lowpotentials with normal or high rectifier output.2.2.8.1.  Check  potentials  on  both  sides  of  dielectrics.  Higher  than  normalpotentials on the house side of the dielectrics indicate a short somewhere inthe system.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199925Table 2.2.

If all dielectrics check good, look for new services,  shorts arounddielectrics, current pickup on foreign structures,  and/or underground shortsby conducting over-the-line survey using Audio Frequency (or 120-Cps) pipelocator or cell-to-cell procedures.2.2.8.1.3.  Low  potentials  on  house  side  of  the  dielectrics  indicates  otherproblems.2.2.9.    For  systems  that  are  not  isolated,  the  most  common  reason  of  lowpotentials with normal rectifier output, is a change in the amount of structureprotected.  This may also occur on isolated structures.2.2.9.1.  Check  for  changes  to  the  structure  (additions  or  changes  to  theutility system).2.2.9.2.

Drying of anodes raises circuit resistance, and lowers current.2.2.12.1.  Compare soil conditions to those during previous readings.2.2.12.1.1.  If  potentials  do  not  meet  criteria  because  the  soil  around  theanodes has dried out, do not adjust rectifier.2.2.12.1.2.  Anodes  are  normally  deeper  than  the  structure.    If  anodes  aredried out, then the structure is also dried out, lowering the corrosion rate.2.2.12.1.3.  Subsequent  wetting  of  soil  could  damage  system  or  causeexcessive output.2.2.12.1.4.  If  potentials  still  meet  criteria,  annotate  reading,  do  not  adjustrectifier.2.2.13.    Before  a  great  deal  of  time  is  expended  troubleshooting  an  anodebed, it should be determined from records if there is sufficient anode materialto attempt locating and repairing the fault.2.2.13.1.  If a gradual failure occurred, deterioration of one  or  more anodescan be expected.  If the failure was sudden, a cable break or loss of one ormore  anodes  can  be  expected.    If  no  anodes  are  operating,  see  paragraph2.2.14.2.2.13.2.  If system permits, measure current output of individual anodes.2.2.13.3.  Perform an anode bed plot.2.2.13.3.1.

Troubleshooting  Galvanic  (Sacrificial)  CP  Systems.    The  mostcommon  problem  encountered  in  galvanic  anode  systems  is  the  loss  ofstructure isolation.2.4.1.  Check potentials on both sides of dielectrics.2.4.1.2.  Higher than normal potentials on the house (unprotected) side of thedielectrics indicate a short somewhere in the system.2.4.1.2.1.  Check  all  installed  dielectrics  using  a  suitable  isolation  tester(such as the gas electronics model 601) (figure 2.5).2.4.1.2.2.  If all dielectrics check good, look for new services, shorts arounddielectrics,  current  pickup  on  foreign  structures,  and/or  underground  shortsby conducting over-the-line survey using 120-cps pipe locator or cell-to-cellprocedures.Figure 2.5.  Checking Potentials on Installed Dielectrics.2.4.1.2.3.  Low potentials on the house  side  of  all  dielectrics is normal  andindicates good isolation.  Other problems are causing the loss of protection.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999362.4.2.  Before  a  great  deal  of  time  is  expended  troubleshooting  galvanicanode  systems,  it  should  be  determined  from  records  if  there  is  sufficientanode material to attempt locating and repairing the fault(s).2.4.2.1.  When  galvanic  anodes  begin  to  fail  due  to  normal  consumption,replacement of the CP system should be programmed.2.4.2.2.  Usually,  the  most  cost-effective  method  of  replacing  an  entiregalvanic anode system is by installation of an impressed current system.2.4.3.  If a gradual failure occurred, deterioration of one or more anodes canbe expected.2.4.4.  If the failure was sudden, a cable break can be expected.  This is mostcommon  when  anodes  are  installed  on  a  continuous  header  cable,  andconnected to the structure at a test station.2.4.4.1.  Perform an anode bed survey.2.4.4.1.1.

CP  Test  Procedures.  Potential  measurement  is  the  fundamental  testprocedure used in CP testing.3.2.  Potential Measurement.3.2.1.  The  theory  is  to  measure  an  unknown  potential  by  relating  it  to  aknown reference electrode.3.2.1.1.  In soil and fresh water conditions the copper/copper sulfate referenceelectrode should be used.3.2.1.2.  In salt water conditions the silver/silver chloride reference electrodemust be used.3.2.2.  A high input impedance voltmeter must be used to prevent erroneousreadings.3.2.2.1.  The  voltmeter  must  have  a  minimum  of  10  megohms  inputresistance under normal conditions.3.2.2.2.

Do not use a currentcarrying conductor for meter connection.3.2.3.3.3.  Note that connections must be made backwards to prevent damageto the meter.  Interpret the positive deflection as a negative reading.3.2.4.  Five sources of error.3.2.4.1.  The  accuracy  of  the  reference  electrode  used  can  be  a  source  oferroneous readings.3.2.4.1.1.  Check  the  accuracy  of  the  reference  electrode  (half-cell)  used  totake  potential  measurements.    To  determine  the  accuracy  of  a  referenceelectrode  multiple  reference  electrodes  must  be  used.    Use  one  referenceelectrode,  which  is  not  used  in  the  field,  to  check  against  other  referenceelectrodes.3.2.4.1.2.  A  valid  reference  electrode  must  be  used  to  take  all  potentialmeasurements.   Temperature also  effects  the  potential  of  the  reference  cell.Direct sunlight also effects the potential of the reference cell.3.2.4.1.3.  For  the  full  procedures  on  initiation  of  a  reference  electrode,cleaning of the electrode, preparing the electrolyte solution, and testing of thereference electrode, see MIL HDBK 1136.3.2.4.2.  IR is error present when current is flowing.  Recognize that all "ON"readings contain this error.3.2.4.3.  Anode gradient field is present when current is flowing.  Recognizethat all  "ON" readings  taken  in  the  gradient  field  of  an  anode,  contain  thiserror.3.2.4.4.  Contact resistance error.  When the reference electrode is not in goodcontact with the electrolyte this error will result in a low reading.  Use waterto lower contact resistance (figure 3.2) or select higher input impedance.  Ifreading  changes,  select  even  higher  input  impedance.    Continue  until  noAFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199941change  in reading  occurs.    Use  formula  to  calculate  approximate  reading  ifrequired.Figure 3.2.  Using Water to Lower Contact Resistance.3.2.4.5.  Potential  measurement  being  influenced  by  foreign  structures  ordifferent parts of the same structure (mixed potentials).3.2.4.5.1.

This occurs on all non-isolated structures, where in the influence ofpotential  gradients  from  other  structures.    Recognize  this  error  when  nearother  structures.    For  example,  copper,  cast  iron,  or  galvanized  piping  orgrounds.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999423.2.4.6.  For full details about these five errors, see MIL HDBK 1136.3.3.    Practical  Measurement  of  CP  Potentials.    The  method  used  forpotential  testing  varies  widely  for  different  types  of  structures  and  for  thedifferent  criteria  used  for  evaluation  of  the  potentials  taken.    Sometimesdifferent criteria may be used for different areas on the same structure.3.3.1.  The test method used depends first on the criteria which is being usedto  evaluate  the  adequacy  of  the  CP  applied  to  the  structure.    The  criteriaselected depends mostly on  the type  of  the  structure;  isolation/non-isolationof the structure; structure coating type and efficiency; the type of CP system;the soil resistivity; the amount of current supplied by the CP system, and theinstrumentation available for testing.3.3.2.  Galvanic  CP  System  Criteria  Selection:    Generally,  the  criterianormally used is the -0.85 on criteria.  Galvanic systems are normally used inlow  soil  resistivities,  with  a  low  current  requirement,  very  small  drivingvoltage, and have a very small amount of current flow.3.3.2.1.  Consideration of the IR error must be made.3.3.2.1.1.  This  is  usually  accomplished  by  placement  of  the  referenceelectrode  as  near  to  the  structure  as  possible  (directly  over  the  pipeline  ortank) and as remote as possible from any galvanic anode.3.3.2.1.2.  This,  combined  with  knowledge  of  the  structure  coating,  soilresistivity, the size and spacing of the anodes and the anode current, is usuallysufficient in determining the adequacy of the CP applied to the structure.3.3.2.1.3.  If  doubt  exists,  or  for  questionable  potential  readings,  use  othercriteria or excavate to allow the reference electrode to be placed as close aspractical to the structure to further minimize IR error.3.3.2.2.  Use alternative criteria if3.3.2.2.1.  The dielectric strength of the structure coating is not good.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999433.3.2.2.2.  The soil resistivity is relatively high.3.3.2.2.3.  The  location  or  spacing  of  the  anodes  makes  it  impossible  tomeasure the structure potential remote from the anodes.3.3.2.3.  For  very  small  and  well  coated  structures  (such  as  valves,  elbows,tie-downs, etc.), the 100 mV polarization criteria should be used.3.3.2.4.  If  the  system  is  designed  to  allow  interrupting  the  current  from  allanodes simultaneously, the 100 mV polarization criteria should be used.3.3.2.5.  The -0.85 instant off criteria is not attainable in many soil conditionswith galvanic anodes.3.3.2.5.1.  Unless the native potential of the structure is very high and/or thesoil resistivity is very low.3.3.2.5.2.  The  -0.85 instant  off  criteria  should not  be  used  for  galvanic  CPsystems  except  in  rare  cases.    The  100  mV  shift  criteria  or  the  -0.85  oncriteria (considering IR) should be used.3.3.3.  Impressed Current CP System Criteria Selection.3.3.3.1.  For distributed anode impressed current systems:3.3.3.1.1.  The 100 mV polarization criteria may be the easiest to use.3.3.3.1.2.  The -0.85 instant off may be used.3.3.3.1.3.  The -0.85 on criteria (considering IR) should not be used.3.3.3.2.  For remote anode impressed current systems:3.3.3.2.1.  Any criteria, or a mixture of criteria may be used.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999443.3.3.2.2.  For  structures  with  a  high  dielectric  strength  coating,  the  -0.85instant off criteria may be the easiest to use; the 100 mV polarization criteriamay be used.  The -0.85 on criteria (considering IR) should not be used.3.3.3.2.3.  For structures which are bare, poorly coated, or have a deterioratedcoating, the 100 mV polarization criteria may be the easiest to use; the -0.85instant off criteria may be used.  The -0.85 on criteria (considering IR) shouldnot be used.3.3.3.2.4.  If  the  electrolyte  resistivity  is  low,  the  dielectric  strength  of  thecoating is high, and the circuit resistance of the CP system is low.  The -0.85on criteria (considering IR error) is sufficient.  Consideration of the IR errormust be made.  This is usually accomplished by placement  of  the referenceelectrode  as  near  to  the  structure  as  possible  (directly  over  the  pipeline  ortank).    This,  combined  with  knowledge  of  the  structure  coating,  soilresistivity, the size and location of the anodes, and amount of anode current,is sufficient in determining the adequacy of the CP applied to the structure.  Ifdoubt  exists,  or  for  questionable  potential  readings,  use  other  criteria  orexcavate to allow the reference electrode to be placed as close as practical tothe structure to further minimize IR error.3.3.4.  Test Methods for the -0.85 on criteria:3.3.4.1.  A  single  electrode  potential  survey  is  conducted  using  any  highimpedance or high input resistant voltmeter (10 megaohms or higher) or datalogger.3.3.4.1.1.  Connect meter as previously described.3.3.4.1.2.  Use proper reference electrode as previously described.3.3.4.1.3.  See  paragraph  3.4  for  information  and  potential  measurementlimits.3.3.4.2.  Since these potential readings are taken with the CP current on, thereare  errors  in  the  measurement  which  must  be  considered  to  obtain  a  validconclusion that adequate CP.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999453.3.4.3.  Consideration  is  understood  to  mean  the  application  of  soundengineering  practice  in  determining  the  significance  of  voltage  drops  bymethods such as:3.3.4.3.1.  Measuring or calculating the voltage drop(s).3.3.4.3.2.  Reviewing the historical performance of the CP system.3.3.4.3.3.  Evaluating  the  physical  and  electrical  characteristics  of  the  pipeand its environment.3.3.4.3.4.  Determining  whether  or  not  there  is  physical  evidence  ofcorrosion.3.3.4.4.  Also,  consideration  of  all  five  errors  (previously  listed)  must  bemade.3.3.4.5.  Interruption of the CP current does not fall under this criteria, sincethat would pertain to the -0.85 instant off or the 100 mV polarization criteria.3.3.4.6.  Measuring  or  calculating the  voltage  drop(s)  include  measuring  allthe factors which affect the magnitude of the voltage errors present in the onreading such as:3.3.4.6.1.  The anode output (rectifier current output).3.3.4.6.2.  The structure coating efficiency.3.3.4.6.3.  The location of the reference cell in relation to the anodes and thestructure.3.3.4.6.4.  The electrolyte resistivity.3.3.4.6.5.  Comparison to previous potentials (native, on, and/or instant off).AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999463.3.4.7.  Implementation  of  this  criteria  is  only  possible  when  these  factorscan  be  quantitatively  verified  by  measurement  or  historical  evidence  thatthese factors have been considered.3.3.4.8.  Factors  which  decrease  magnitude  of  the  voltage  drop  errors  orotherwise reduce the corrosion rate:3.3.4.8.1.  High dielectric strength coating.3.3.4.8.2.  Low electrolyte resistivity.3.3.4.8.3.  High pH (7 to 13), (except lead or aluminum structures).3.3.4.8.4.  Low temperatures lower the corrosion rate.3.3.4.8.5.  Low current density.3.3.4.8.6.  Non-existence of bimetallic connections (isolated structures).3.3.4.8.7.  Non-existence of interference corrosion.3.3.4.8.8.  Shallow and uniform pipe depth.3.3.5.  Test Methods for the -0.85 instant off criteria:3.3.5.1.  This criteria requires the measurement of the potentials when there isno CP current flowing.3.3.5.2.  For  various  methods  used  to  measure  the  instant  off  potential  seeMIL HDBK 1136 section 7.2.5, Instant Off Test Methods which include:3.3.5.2.1.  Simultaneous  interruption  of  all  anode  current  (normally  at  therectifier)  and  use  of  a  meter  which  records  hi/low  readings  (or  recordingsecond flash of a digital meter) and manually recording measurements.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999473.3.5.2.2.  Simultaneous  interruption  of  all  anode  current  (normally  at  therectifier) and use of a data logger and extracting measurement manually fromthe database or by use of appropriate software.3.3.5.2.3.  Use of pulse generators and a waveform analyzer.3.3.5.2.4.  Simultaneous  use  of  a  high  speed  data  logger  and  filteredoscilloscope to record the potential when the current is at zero.3.3.5.2.5.  If  the  instant  off  potential  measurement  meets  or  exceeds  -0.85Volts DC (using a copper/copper sulfate reference electrode), this criteria hasbeen met.    Other reference  electrodes  must  be  corrected  to  the  factor  for  acopper/copper sulfate reference to be valid under this criterion.3.3.6.  Test Methods for the 100 mV polarization criteria:3.3.6.1.  The test method for this criteria is similar to the negative 0.85 instantoff  criterion,  with  the  additional  requirement  of  comparing  the  instant  offreading to a native or depolarized reading.3.3.6.2.  For unprotected isolated structures:3.3.6.2.1.  Perform a thorough native survey and identify the most anodic area(highest negative) reading.3.3.6.2.2.  Determine  the  instant  off  reading  required  to  meet  the  100  mVshift criterion at that point (example, if the most negative reading was -0.625Volts DC, the instant off would have to be -0.725 Volts DC).3.3.6.2.3.  Apply that instant off criterion to the entire structure.3.3.6.3.  For unprotected structures that are not isolated:3.3.6.3.1.  Perform  a  thorough  native  survey  and  identify  the  most  anodicareas (highest negative) readings.  If  those  readings are unusually high (overAFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199948-0.700  volts  DC),  annotate  those  exact  locations;  add  100  mV  to  thosereadings; or compare future instant off readings to those specific readings atthose specific locations.  If a significant percentage of the pipeline is over -0.700  Volts  DC,  consider  using the  -0.85  instant  off  criterion  for  the  entirepipeline.3.3.6.3.2.  Determine  the  instant  off  reading  required  to  meet  the  100  mVshift  criterion  for  the  rest  of  the  structure  (example,  if  the  most  negativereading for the rest of the structure was -0.603 Volts DC, the 100 mV instantoff would have to be -0.703 Volts DC).3.3.6.3.3.  Apply that instant off criteria to the rest of the structure.3.3.6.4.  For protected structures:3.3.6.4.1.  If native survey data is available, analyze data and use proceduresas above for unprotected isolated or non-isolated structures, as appropriate.3.3.6.4.2.  If  native  survey  data  is  not  available,  is  incomplete  or  otherwisenot useful, consider using the other criteria.3.3.6.4.3.  To  use the  100 mV  shift  criterion after CP has  been applied,  thestructure  must  be  depolarized,  to  obtain  an  approximation  of  the  nativepotential,  and  use  procedures  as  above  for  unprotected  isolated  or  non-isolated  structures,  as  appropriate.    After  current  interruption,  considerabletime may be required before the potential returns to an approximation of thenative potential value:60 to 90 days for typical well-coated buried structures.2 to 30 days for buried structures with poor or no coating.90 to 150 days for water tank interiors with good coatings and little orno water circulation.3.3.6.4.4.  Certain  soil  conditions  may  slow  or  speed  depolarization,generally, the higher the corrosion rate, the quicker the depolarization occurs.Some  factors,  such  as high levels  of  oxygen,  movement  or  agitation  of  theelectrolyte (flowing water) will speed depolarization.  Some factors, such asAFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199949structure coatings, high resistivity soil, low levels of oxygen, and soils whichseal  the  structure  from  water  and  oxygen  will  slow  depolarization.Considerably  more  current  is  required  to  polarize  the  structure  to  a  levelwhere the 100 mV depolarization will occur in a relatively short time period(seconds or minutes).3.3.6.4.5.  If the instant off potential is 100 mV more negative than the nativepotential (or depolarized) potential, this criterion has been met.3.4.  Structure-to-Soil Potential Limits.3.4.1.  Excessive CP current produces hydrogen gas evolution at the surfaceof the cathode:3.4.1.1.  If  the  gas  is  produced  faster  than  it  can  permeate  out  through  thecoating, bubbling of the coating will occur.3.4.1.2.  The  amount  of  coating  damage is  dependent  on the  amount  of  gasgenerated and the type of coating.3.4.1.3.  The  "on"  potentials  have  many  errors  in  the  measurement  (fivesources of errors previously discussed).3.4.2.  All  potentials  discussed  in  this  section  are  in  reference  to  acopper/copper  sulfate  reference  electrode.    For  other  reference  electrodes,make proper correction to interpret the measurement.3.4.3.  For water storage tanks:3.4.3.1.  Coatings  used  in  water  tanks  disbond  very  easily  as  compared  tocoatings used on underground structures.3.4.3.2.  Note  that  silver/silver  chloride reference  electrodes  potential  variesas the chloride content of the electrolyte changes (reference).3.4.3.3.  "On"  potential  measurements  over  -1.10  volts  DC  could  causecoating damage and "instant off" potentials should be taken (according to themagnitude of errors in the reading).AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999503.4.3.4.  "On"  potential  measurements  over  -1.50  volts  DC  should  beexpected to cause coating damage and "instant off" potentials must be taken.3.4.3.5.  The instant off potentials must never exceed -1.10 volts DC.3.4.4.  For underground structures:3.4.4.1.  Coatings for underground  structures  are  generally  more resistant  todamage from excessive CP current.3.4.4.2.  The only true way to measure the possibility for coating damage iswith an error free measurement (see paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3).3.4.4.3.  Instant off measurements should be used whenever possible:3.4.4.3.1.  Instant off measurements over -1.22 volts DC are not theoreticallypossible.  Look for other DC current sources.3.4.4.3.2.  Synchronous accomplished.interruption  of  all  current  sources  must  be3.4.4.4.  For  fusion  bonded  coatings  the  instant  off  potentials  should  notexceed -1.07 volts DC and must never exceed -1.12 volts DC.3.4.4.5.  For  Coal   Tar   coatings   the  instant  off  potentials   should  not   exceed-1.12 volts DC and must never exceed -1.20 volts DC.3.4.4.6.  For  Plastic  Tape  coatings  the  instant  off  potentials  should  not  exceed -1.02 volts DC and must never exceed -1.07 volts DC.3.4.4.7.  For  other  coatings refer to  specifications  for  cathodic  disbondmentproperties compared to above coatings.3.4.4.8.  For uncoated structures there is theoretically no potential limit.Instant off readings over -1.00 generally waste power and anode material.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999513.4.4.9.  Table  3.1  assumes  an  IR  drop  error  and  is  given  for  informationonly.3.4.4.9.1.  "On" potential should be suspected of coating damage if over thepotentials  listed  in  table  3.1,  "SUSPECTED  column",  and  "instant  off"potentials should be taken.3.4.4.9.2.  Coating  damage  should  be  expected  when the  potentialmeasurement is over the potential listed in table 3.1, "EXPECTED column",and "instant off" potentials must be taken.Table 3.1.

Cell to Cell Potential Testing Procedures.3.5.1.  Cell to cell potential testing is performed to determine the direction ofcurrent flow in the earth:3.5.1.1.  This  is  especially  useful  on  unprotected  pipelines  to  locate  anodicareas on the pipeline.  These procedures are not normally used on protectedstructures.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999523.5.1.2.  On  unprotected  pipelines  when  CP  of  the  complete  line  is  notfeasible  or  economical,  “hot  spot  protection”  is  sometimes  used.    This  testprocedure is used to identify the anodic areas of the pipeline for applicationof CP to those locations.3.5.1.3.  The  polarity  of  the  voltage  difference  between  the  two  referencecells indicates the direction of current flow.3.5.2.  The accuracy of the reference electrodes (half cells) used to take cell tocell measurements must be determined:3.5.2.1.  The  accuracy  of  the  two  half  cells is  determined  by  measuring  thedifference in potential between the two half cells being used for the test.  Usea suitable high input resistance voltmeter on the millivolt scale, place the twocells  cone  to  cone,  and  measure  the  potential  difference.    The  potentialdifference should not be in excess of 5 mV.3.5.2.2.  Perfect  matching  of  the  two  reference  cells  is  desirable.    If  perfectmatching is not possible, the error must be accounted for in all measurementstaken.3.5.2.3.  Equal spacing between the reference cells must be made to evaluateany magnitude differences in measurements.3.5.2.4.  Polarity of the measurements is critical.  Notes should be made of allchanges in polarity.3.6.  Rectifier Efficiency Testing Procedures.3.6.1.  The efficiency of a rectifier is determined by:3.6.1.1.  Measuring the output voltage.3.6.1.2.  Measuring output current.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999533.6.1.3.  Calculating  the  input  in  watts  (revolutions  per  hour  of  the  KWHmeter disc X PF (Power Factor) shown on the face of the KWH meter).3.6.1.4.  And using the following formula:Rectifier Efficiency =Output Current X Output VoltageInput Watts3.6.2.  An alternate procedure to determine the rectifier efficiency if there isno KWH meter or known Power Factor:3.6.2.1.  Measuring the output voltage.3.6.2.2.  Measuring output current.3.6.2.3.  Obtain the input watts is by:3.6.2.3.1.  Measure the AC input voltage.3.6.2.3.2.  Measure  the  AC  input  current  by  using  an  accurate  clamp-onammeter  (preferred)  or  disconnecting  and  measuring  with  an  ammeter.Assume a PF of 90% and use the following formula:Rectifier Efficiency = Output Current X Output VoltageInput Current X Input Voltage X .93.6.2.4.  This  method  assumes  the  power  factor  (usually  between  85%  and95%):3.6.2.4.1.  Will not be truly accurate.3.6.2.4.2.  Will give a reasonable approximation.3.6.2.4.3.  If  this  method  is  used,  subsequent  efficiency  testing  should  bedone in the same manner to obtain comparable results.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999543.6.2.5.  The expected efficiency of a rectifier depends on:3.6.2.5.1.  The type of AC power (Single or Three Phase).  Three phase unitsare much more efficient.3.6.2.5.2.  The  type  of  rectifying  elements  (Selenium  or  Silicon).    Siliconunits are more efficient.3.6.2.5.3.  The type of rectifier (Bridge or Center tap).3.6.2.5.4.  The  percent  of  load  of  the  unit.    Units  are  most  efficient  at  fullrated output.3.6.3.  A  change  in  rectifier  efficiency  indicates  problems  with  the  rectifierunit.3.7.  Dielectric Testing Procedures.3.7.1.  Do  not  use  an  ohmmeter  to  measure  resistance  of  an  installeddielectric:3.7.1.1.  An  ohmmeter  should  never  be  used  on  a  live  circuit.    A  gooddielectric may have a significant voltage present, and should be considered alive circuit.3.7.1.2.  If the dielectric is good, and the two sides have a voltage difference,current will flow through the ohmmeter and could damage the ohmmeter:3.7.1.2.1.  The  measurement  would  not  indicate  a  resistance  value  becausethe voltage difference would be added or subtracted from the internal batteryvoltage measured (according to polarity).3.7.1.2.2.  A totally erroneous (or even negative) measurement would result.3.7.1.3.  If the dielectric is good, and the two sides have no significant voltagedifference, there would be little or no current flow through the ohmmeter:AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999553.7.1.3.1.  The measurement would indicate a sum of  the resistance to  earthof the structures on both sides of the dielectric.3.7.1.3.2.  According  to  the  size and  coating  of  the  structures  involved, thiscould be from less than 1 ohm to several thousand ohms, and does not giveany indication of the resistance across the dielectric.3.7.2.  Testing an installed dielectric presents several problems:3.7.2.1.  Since  typical installations normally  include  many  dielectrics,  all  ofwhich are in a parallel circuit, failure  of  one  dielectric  can  effectively  shortthe entire system.3.7.2.2.  There  are  indications  of  the  shorted  condition  of  one  dielectric  atmany, or all, other dielectrics installed.3.7.2.3.  Some  methods  for testing  a  dielectric look  for  a  voltage  differenceacross the two sides, which is an indication of that dielectrics condition:3.7.2.3.1.  If voltage is detected, the dielectric is not shorted.3.7.2.3.2.  If  voltage  is not  detected, the  dielectric may  be  shorted.    Furthertesting is required to verify the condition.3.7.2.3.3.  Use  of  the  headset  type  of  insulation  tester  (similar  to  Tinker  &Rasor model  "IT").   If  tone is heard,  voltage  is  present  the  dielectric  is notshorted.  If tone is not heard, voltage is not detected (see above).3.7.2.3.4.  Use of a multimeter to measure a mV difference.  Range should beon  Auto  (mV  range  is  typically  300mV,  which  could  easily  be  exceededacross a good dielectric).  If meter is not auto-ranging, select high range forinitial measurement  and  change ranges  until  best resolution is achieved.    Ameasurement  over  10  mV  indicates  the  dielectric  is  not  shorted.    Ameasurement under 10 mV is inconclusive (see above).AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999563.7.2.3.5.  Compass:    Place  a  magnetic  type  compass  on  the  dielectric.    Ifcompass  aligns  with  the  direction  of  the  pipe,  voltage  is  present  and  thedielectric is shorted.  If compass does not align, voltage is not detected (seeabove).    Sometimes  a  6  or  12  volt  battery  is  connected  to  the  circuit  as  anadditional voltage difference, and the test repeated.3.7.2.3.6.  Use  a  clamp-on  DC  milliammeter  with  properly  sized  clamp  forpipeline  being  tested.    Place  clamp  next  to  pipe,  zero  meter,  and  clamparound pipe at the dielectric.  If measurement is over 10 milliamps, dielectricis  shorted.    If  measurement  is  under  10  milliamps,  dielectric  may  not  beshorted.3.7.2.4.  Only  one  method  gives  a  totally  reliable  indication  of  an  installeddielectric (figure 3.3):Figure 3.3.  Using a Radio Frequency Tester.3.7.2.4.1.  The  insulated  flange  tester  (radio  frequency  tester)  gives  anaccurate indication of the specific dielectric being tested because of its wavelength,  the  strength  of  the  signal  and  use  of  the  "skin  effect"  (most  of  thesignal travels on the surface of the dielectric).AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999573.7.2.4.2.  This method will not read through other parallel paths, even whenthese paths are in the immediate vicinity.  Therefore, this method should beused for testing when any other method is not conclusive.3.7.3.  The preferred method to determine if a dielectric may be shorted is bystructure to earth potential testing:3.7.3.1.  This method will provide an immediate indication if the dielectric isnot  shorted.    At  the  same  time  it  will  provide  valuable  potential  data.Determine if there may be another dielectric in the area which is shorted.3.7.3.2.  Take a potential measurement of both sides of the installed dielectric(figure  3.4).    Change  only  the  structure  connection.    Do  not  move  thereference electrode.Figure 3.4  Taking Potentials to Test Installed Dielectric.3.7.3.3.  If the two potential measurements are significantly different (over 10mV), the dielectric is good:AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999583.7.3.3.1.  The street (protected) side of the dielectric should be at a potentialmore negative than -0.85 Volts DC.3.7.3.3.2.  The house  (unprotected)  side  of  the  dielectric  should  be  betweenapproximately -0.15 Volts DC and -0.55 Volts DC .3.7.3.3.3.  If the dielectric is good and the house side of the dielectric has apotential  more  negative  than  expected  (for  example,  if  the  house  sidepotential  reading  is  over  -0.65,  with  a  street  side  potential  more  negative),another  shorted  dielectric  in  the  area  should  be  suspected.    Furtherinvestigation is required.3.7.3.4.  If  the  two  potential  measurements  are  not  significantly  different(under  10  mV),  the  dielectric  may  be  shorted.    The  insulated  flange  testershould be used.3.7.4.  Using insulated flange tester, there are two different type units:  AboveGround Insulator Tester (can also be used to test individual bolts on isolatedflanges)  and  Buried  Insulator  Tester.    Use  each  type  only  for  it’s  intendedapplication.3.7.4.1.  There  are  two  different  models  of  each  type  of  insulated  flangetester.3.7.4.1.1.  Tester with "zero"/"test" switch and control knob.  Turn InsulatedFlange Tester  "zero"/"test" switch to "zero".  Turn control knob on.  Usingcontrol  knob,  zero  needle  indicator  to  full  scale  (100).    Turn  “zero”/”test”switch to “test”.  Without adjusting control knob,  test  dielectric.   You  mustmake  good  contact  to  metal  on  both  sides  of  the  dielectric.    No  needlemovement indicates  good  dielectric  (stays  at  full  scale).    Needle movementindicates bad dielectric.3.7.4.1.2.  Tester without switch or control knob.  To test dielectric, you mustmake  good  contact  to  metal  on  both  sides  of  dielectric.    For  undergroundmodel, hold contact for at least 20 seconds.  An audible signal is heard whentest cycle is completed.  No change in LCD display and no change in audiblesignal indicates good dielectric.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999593.7.4.2.  Using a long wave length signal (low frequency) pipe locator:3.7.4.2.1.  Install signal transmitter on pipeline.3.7.4.2.2.  Ensure low resistance isolated ground for transmitter.3.7.4.2.3.  Use  pipe  locator  and  attempt  to  follow  signal  past  dielectric.    Ifsignal  stops  at  dielectric,  dielectric  may  not  be  shorted.    If  signal  can  befollowed past dielectric, dielectric is shorted.3.7.4.3.  Using  a  fault  detector  and  the  signal  from  an  impressed  currentsystem  (DC  output  has  a  120-cps  component,  sometimes  called  "pulsatingDC").3.7.4.3.1.  This method can only be used with impressed current systems witha  single  phase  rectifier,  and  works  best  with  no  output  choke  or  filter(stronger signal).3.7.4.3.2.  Must use a fault detector (such as the Pipe Horn Model 200FDAC)or a pipe locator (with built in fault detector) capability of following a 120-cps signal.3.7.4.3.3.  Installation of a current interrupter on the rectifier will ensure thatfault  detector  is  following  the  impressed  current  signal.    Electrical  linesproduce a 120-cps harmonic which can also be followed with a fault detector.3.7.4.3.4.  Use fault detector to follow signal on pipeline to the dielectric.3.7.4.3.5.  Use fault detector and attempt to follow  signal past  dielectric.   Ifsignal  stops  at  dielectric,  dielectric  may  not  be  shorted.    If  signal  can  befollowed past dielectric, dielectric is shorted.3.7.4.4.  Other methods to make dielectric testing easier:AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999603.7.4.4.1.  If  possible,  merely  increase  the  current  level  of  the  existing  CPsystem.    This  will  serve  to  increase  the  difference  across  good  dielectrics,making it easier to test.  This will also increase the signal available for mostother methods of dielectric testing.  Repeat the dielectric testing.3.7.4.4.2.  Installation  of  a  temporary  local  CP  system  (or  battery  acrossdielectric).    This  may  greatly  increase  the  current  to  the  street  side  of  thedielectric, making it easier to test.  The temporary system should be installedso  that  the  current  will  be  applied  to the  location  being  tested.    Repeat  thedielectric testing.3.7.4.4.3.  Use a multi-combination meter, continuity check circuit.  Connecttest  leads  to  the  meter  left  terminals.    Temporarily  short  test  lead  endstogether,  turn  contact  check  circuit  on,  zero  needle  to  full  scale,  anddisconnect  test  leads.    Connect  one  test  lead  to  street  (protected)  side  ofdielectric.  Connect one test lead to house (unprotected) side of dielectric.  Afull scale deflection indicates shorted dielectric.  Use insulated flange tester toverify specific dielectric.A  deflection  of  75%  to  almost  full  scale  deflection,  or  deflection  past100% (or pegged) is inconclusive.  Reverse test lead connections:  samereading  indicates  there  may  be  a  bad  dielectric  in  the  area  or  that  thedielectric is partially shorted.  Use insulated flange tester to verify specificdielectric.  Opposite side of full scale reading indicates dielectric is good,for  example,  90%  reading,  when  leads  are  reversed  pegs,  or  peggedreading reversed, reads 90%.  Use other test procedure to verify dielectriccondition.Deflection from 30% to 75% is inconclusive.  Could be bad dielectric inthe area.  Use other test procedure to verify dielectric condition.Deflection  under  30%  indicates  all  dielectrics  in  the  area  are  good(structures are isolated).3.8.  Casing Test Procedures.3.8.1.  Testing casings is very similar to testing dielectrics:AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999613.8.1.1.  Do not use an ohmmeter to measure between a casing and the carrierpipeline:3.8.1.1.1.  An  ohmmeter  should  never  be  used  on  a  live  circuit.    A  goodcasing  isolation  may  have  a  significant  voltage  present,  and  should  beconsidered  a  live  circuit.    If  the  casing  isolation  is  good,  current  will  flowthrough the meter and could damage the meter.3.8.1.1.2.  The  measurement  would  not  indicate  a  resistance  value.    Thevoltage difference  would  be  interpreted  as  coming  from  the internal  batteryinstead of the external electrical circuit being measured.  A totally erroneous(or even negative) measurement would result.3.8.1.2.  Shorted casings present serious problems to the application of CP tothe carrier pipe.3.8.1.2.1.  They  totally  shield  the  carrier  pipeline  inside  the  casing  fromreceiving any CP.3.8.1.2.2.  They “steal” current which would otherwise protect a large area ofthe pipeline outside the casing.  Casings are normally  not  coated  (or  poorlycoated).    Have  a  relatively  low  resistance  to  earth  (than  the  coated  carrierpipeline).  Provide a lower resistant path for CP current.3.8.2.  Casing test stations normally have four wires:  two to the casing; twoto  the  carrier  pipeline.    If  there  is  not  a  test  station  already  installed,  oneshould be installed prior to testing.  At a minimum, there must be a metallicconnection made to the carrier pipeline and a vent pipe which is connected tothe casing.  If there is no vent pipe or carrier pipe test point in the vicinity ofthe casing, excavation must be made to the carrier pipeline or the casing, asrequired, and test connections made.3.8.3.  Use  a  suitable  insulated  flange  tester  (for  testing  undergroundisolations).    Follow  the  same  procedures  listed  previously  for  testing  adielectric.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999623.8.4.  Testing a casing with CP on the carrier pipeline:3.8.4.1.  Take a potential measurement of the carrier pipeline.3.8.4.2.  Take  a  potential  measurement  of  the  casing.    Do  not  change  thelocation of the reference electrode.3.8.4.3.  If the two potential measurements are significantly different (over 10mV), the casing is not shorted to the pipeline.  Under normal conditions thecarrier pipeline should be at a potential more negative than -0.85 Volts DC.The casing should be between  approximately  -0.35 and  -0.65  Volts  DC.   Ifcasing is galvanized, it could be as high as -1.1 Volts DC.3.8.4.4.  If  the  two  potential  measurements  are  not  significantly  different(under  10  mV),  the  casing  may  be  shorted  to  the  pipeline.    One  of  thefollowing additional tests may be made:3.8.4.4.1.  If  possible,  increase  the  current  level  of  the  existing  system  orinstall  a  temporary  local  CP  system  to  increase  the  current  to  the  carrierpipeline.  The temporary CP system must be installed on the opposite side ofthe  crossing  from  the  location  of  the  potential  testing.    The  potential  shiftwhich occurs when the CP system is interrupted may also aid in determiningif the casing is isolated.3.8.4.4.2.  Repeat  potential  measurement  of  the  carrier  pipeline  and  thecasing.    If  the  potential  of  the  casing  shifts  positive  when  the  currentincreases  or  turns  on,  the  insulation  is  good.    If  the  potential  of  the  casingshifts  negative  when  the  current  increases  or  turns  on,  the  casing  may  beshorted.3.8.4.4.3.  Use a suitable insulated flange tester (see above).3.8.5.  Testing a casing without CP on the carrier pipeline.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999633.8.5.1.  Use  an  insulated  flange  tester  suitable  for  testing  undergrounddielectrics.    Follow  the  same  procedures  listed  previously  for  testing  adielectric.3.8.5.2.  Install a  temporary  local  CP  system  to  apply  current  to  the  carrierpipeline.  Test the same as the casing with CP on carrier pipeline (see above).3.8.5.3.  Use a multi-combination meter, continuity check circuit.3.8.5.3.1.  Connect test leads to  the meter  left  terminals.   Temporarily  shorttest lead ends together; turn contact check circuit on; zero needle to full scale,and disconnect test leads.3.8.5.3.2.  Connect one test lead to casing.3.8.5.3.3.  Connect  one  test  lead  to  carrier  pipeline.    Full  scale  deflectionindicates the casing is shorted to the carrier pipeline.Deflection  of  75%  to  almost  full  scale  deflection,  or  deflection  past100% (or pegged) is inconclusive.  Reverse test lead connections.  Samereading  indicates  there  may  be  a  partial  short.    Use  undergroundinsulated  flange  tester  to  verify.    Opposite  side  of  full  scale  readingindicates casing isolation is good.  For example, a 90% reading, whenleads  are  reversed,  reads  over  100%  (pegs),  or  a  reading  over  100%(pegged) when leads are reversed. reads under full scale.Deflection  from  30%  to  75%  is  inconclusive:    could  be  partial  short.Reverse  leads  and  test  as  above.    Use  other  test  procedure  to  verifycasing condition.Deflection under 30% indicates good isolation.3.9.  Testing for a Short Between Two Structures.3.9.1.  Testing for a short is similar to dielectric and casing testing.3.9.1.1.  Do not use an ohmmeter to measure between two structures.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999643.9.1.1.1.  An  ohmmeter  should  never  be  used  on  a  live  circuit.    Twostructures which are isolated may  have  a  significant  voltage  difference, andshould be considered a live circuit.  If the structures are isolated, current willflow through the meter and could damage the meter.3.9.1.1.2.  The  measurement  would  not  indicate  a  resistance  value.    Thevoltage would be interpreted by the meter as coming from the internal batteryinstead of the external electrical circuit being measured.  A totally erroneous(or even negative) measurement would result.3.9.1.2.  Use a multi-combination meter, continuity check circuit:3.9.1.2.1.  Connect test leads to  the meter  left  terminals.   Temporarily  shorttest lead ends together; turn contact check circuit on; zero needle to full scale,and disconnect test leads.3.9.1.2.2.  Connect one test lead to casing.3.9.1.2.3.  Connect  one  test  lead  to  carrier  pipeline.    Full  scale  deflectionindicates the two structures are connected.Deflection  of  75%  to  almost  full  scale  deflection,  or  deflection  past100% (or pegged) is inconclusive.  Reverse test lead connections.  Samereading  indicates  there  may  be  a  partial  short  between  the  structures.Other testing should be conducted to verify.  Opposite side of full scalereading indicates structures  are  isolated.   For  example  a  90%  reading,when  leads  are  reversed,  reads  over  100%  (pegs),  or  a  reading  over100% (pegged) when leads are reversed. reads under full scale.Deflection from 30% to 75% is inconclusive.  Could be a partial short inthe area.  Reverse leads and test as above.  Use other test procedure toverify.Deflection under 30% indicates the structures are isolated.3.9.2.  Testing for a short between two structures with CP on one structure:AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999653.9.2.1.  Take a potential measurement of both structures.  Do not move thereference electrode.3.9.2.2.  If the two potential measurements are significantly different (over 10mV), the two structures are not shorted.3.9.2.2.1.  Under  normal  conditions  the  structure  with  CP  should  be  at  apotential more negative than -0.85 Volts DC.3.9.2.2.2.  A  steel  structure  without  CP  should  be  between  approximately  -0.35 Volts DC and -0.65 Volts DC.3.9.2.2.3.  Copper  or  steel  in  concrete  structures  should  have  a  potentialbetween approximately -0.20 Volts DC and -0.30 Volts DC.3.9.2.2.4.  Galvanized  steel  structures  which  are  isolated,  could  have  apotential as high as -1.10 Volts DC.3.9.2.2.5.  Galvanized  steel  structures  can  be  shorted  to  cast  iron,  brass,copper  or  steel  structures, resulting in  a  mixed  potential  (-.40  to  -1.0  VoltsDC).3.9.2.3.  If the two potential readings are not significantly different (under 10mV):3.9.2.3.1.  The two structures may be shorted.  Additional testing is required.Install a  temporary  local  CP  system  to  increase the  current  to  the  protectedstructure  or,  if  possible,  merely  increase  the  current  level  of  the  existingsystem.3.9.2.3.2.  Install  the  temporary  system  to  distribute  current  to  just  onestructure.3.9.2.3.3.  Repeat  the  potential  measurement  of  both  structures.    If  thepotential  of  the  unprotected  structure  remains  approximately  the  same  orchanges  in  a  positive  direction  (less  negative),  when  the  potential  of  theAFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199966protected structure changes in a negative  direction,  they  are not  shorted.   Ifboth  potential  measurements  change  more  negative  as  current  is  increased,the two structures are shorted together.3.9.2.3.4.  Interruption of the CP current may make it easier to test continuity.If the potential of the unprotected structure shifts positive when the rectifier isinterrupted,  they  are  isolated.    If  the  potential  of  the  unprotected  structureshifts negative when the rectifier is interrupted, they may be shorted.3.9.3.  Testing for a short between two structures with CP on both structures.3.9.3.1.  Take a potential measurement of both structures.  Do not move thereference electrode.3.9.3.2.  If the two potential measurements are significantly different (over 10mV), the two structures are not shorted in the area.  Under normal conditionsboth structures should be at a potential more negative than -0.85 Volts DC.3.9.3.3.  If  the  two  potential  measurements  are  not  significantly  different(under 10 mV).3.9.3.3.1.  The two structures may be shorted.  Additional testing is required.3.9.3.3.2.  If  one  or  both  of  the  protected  structures  have  impressed  currentsystems, turn off the rectifier on one system or install a current interrupter onone system.3.9.3.3.3.  Repeat the potential measurement of both structures.  If structuresare isolated, the structure with the CP current off changes significantly in thepositive direction (less negative).  The structure with the CP current still onremains the same.  If structures are shorted, the structure with the CP currentoff  changes  slightly  in  the  positive  direction.    The  structure  with  the  CPcurrent still on changes slightly in the positive direction.3.9.3.3.4.  If  both  systems  have  impressed  current  systems  and  a  clearindication  of  the  shorted  condition  has  still  not  been  identified.    RepeatAFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199967previous  test  procedure  leaving  the  other  systems  rectifier  on  and  repeattesting.  Turn off  both rectifiers and use radio frequency insulation tester ormulti-combination meter continuity check circuit (see procedures above).3.9.4.  Testing  for  a  short  between  two  structures  without  CP  on  eitherstructure.3.9.4.1.  Use radio frequency insulation tester (see procedures above).3.9.4.2.  Use  multi-combination  meter  continuity  check  circuit procedures above).(see3.9.4.3.  Take a potential measurement of both structures.  Do not move thereference electrode.3.9.4.4.  If the two potential measurements are significantly different (over 10mV),  the  two  structures  are  not  shorted.    Under  normal  conditions  bothstructures should be at a potential between approximately -0.35 Volts DC and-0.65 Volts DC.3.9.4.5.  If  the  two  potential  measurements  are  not  significantly  different(under 10 mV).3.9.4.5.1.  The two structures may be shorted.  Additional testing is required.3.9.4.5.2.  Install  a  temporary  local  CP  system  to  apply  current  to  the  onestructure.  Repeat the potential measurement of both structures.  If structuresare isolated, the structure with the CP current will change significantly in thenegative direction.  The structure with no CP current remains approximatelythe  same.    If  structures  are  shorted,  both  structures  change  in  the  negativedirection.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999683.10.  Current Requirement Testing Procedures.3.10.1.  Current  requirement  testing  is  used  when  planning  a  CP  systeminstallation.  This testing will determine the type and size of  the  CP  systemrequired.3.10.2.  If the system design requires isolation of the structure to be protected,that isolation must be accomplished prior to the current requirement test.  Thecurrent requirement for a non-isolated structure does not give any indicationof what the current requirement would be if the structure were isolated.3.10.3.  Temporary  systems  are  used  to  determine  the  effect  of  currentapplied on the potential of the structure being tested.3.10.4.  Actual protection need not be accomplished to estimate the amount ofcurrent required.3.10.4.1.  Portable  rectifiers  should  be  used  in  conjunction  with  temporaryanodes (usually ground rods) or existing metallic structures to impress a testcurrent to the structure.3.10.4.2.  Vehicle  batteries  can  be  used,  as  well  as  spare  rectifiers,  DCgenerators,  DC  welding  units,  or  rectifiers  from  other  systems  can  betemporarily removed for use.3.10.5.  Temporary  local  CP  systems  should  be  located  in  areas  where  theintended installation is to be located, if known:3.10.5.1.  If not known, they should be located as remote as possible from thestructure to be protected.3.10.5.1.1.  Without any foreign structures in the area of the temporary anodebed.3.10.5.1.2.  Without any foreign  structure  between  the  temporary  anode  bedand the structure under test.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999693.10.5.2.  The  area  of  the  temporary  installation  should  be  well  scouted  todetermine if any possible temporary anodes exist or if any foreign structuresare in the area:3.10.5.2.1.  Existing  metallic  structures,  such  as  metal  fences,  culverts,abandoned pipelines, or abandoned wells can be used as temporary anodes orto supplement installed temporary anodes.3.10.5.2.2.  Do not use any metallic structure for a temporary anode which isshorted to the structure being tested.  Large current surges  which  can  causeinjury to personnel and damage to equipment would result.   Test  temporaryanode for continuity to structure under test (see testing for continuity betweentwo structures).3.10.5.2.3.  Do  not  use  active  pipelines  or  tanks  for  temporary  anodes.Corrosion may occur that could cause leaks.3.10.5.3.  The number of temporary anodes required depends on:3.10.5.3.1.  The available voltage source.3.10.5.3.2.  Availability and size of existing metallic structures which may beused.3.10.5.3.3.  The size of the structure being tested.3.10.5.3.4.  The coating efficiency of the structure being tested.3.10.5.3.5.  The amount of current desired.3.10.5.3.6.  The resistivity of the soil.3.10.5.3.7.  Generally, temporary anodes should be spaced from 15 to 25 feetapart.  If temporary anodes are close  together (0 to  8  feet),  will  be  reducedbenefit from adding additional anodes.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999703.10.5.3.8.  If the number of anodes is doubled, the amount of current will beapproximately doubled (with adequate spacing).3.10.5.3.9.  If the soil resistivity is doubled, the number of temporary anodesrequired  is  doubled.    In  very  low  resistivity  soil,  two  or  three  temporaryanodes  may  be  sufficient.    In  very  high  resistivity  soil,  a  high  number  oftemporary anodes may be required.3.10.5.3.10.  The better the coating of the structure being tested, the smallerthe number of temporary anodes required.  Very  well  coated  structures  willexhibit a noticeable potential change with a small amount of current (1 or 2amps).  Poorly coated structures will not exhibit a noticeable potential changeexcept with a larger amount of current (10 to 20 amps).3.10.5.3.11.  If  the  voltage  is  doubled,  the  number  of  temporary  anodesrequired will be approximately cut in half.  If the voltage source is low (6 - 12volts), more temporary anodes will be required.  If the voltage source is high(60 to 120 volts), fewer temporary anodes are required.3.10.5.3.12.  In  dry  soil  conditions  (under  20%  moisture),  watering  theanodes will lower the resistance (provide more current).3.10.5.3.13.  Streams,  ponds,  rivers,  lakes,  bays,  oceans  or  other  standingwater make an  ideal location  for  temporary  anodes.   The  temporary  anodescan be simply laid in the water.3.10.5.3.14.  To make temporary anodes, cut 8 or 10 foot ground rods in half.Sharpen one end.  Use a ground rod driver to install into the ground.  Use aground rod puller to remove from the ground (see MIL HDBK 1136).3.10.5.3.15.  Metallic pipe or conduit may also be used.3.10.5.3.16.  In  extreme  cases,  excavate  6  to  10  foot  hole.    Push  smalldiameter steel pipe into the earth with a backhoe or bulldozer.  This methodcan also be used to attempt to simulate a deeper installation.  It is possible toAFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199971install  temporary  anodes  30  to  60  feet  deep  in  this  manner,  if  no  rockformations are encountered.3.10.5.4.  The  temporary  anodes  must  all  be  connected  to  the  positiveterminal of the power source.3.10.5.5.  The  structure  being  tested  must  be  connected  to  the  negativeterminal of the power source.3.10.5.6.  For physical strength and low resistance, #6 AWG copper cable orlarger must be used.  No. 2 AWG or greater is desired, especially if long runsin either the structure or anode cable is required.  Connections can be madewith  pipe  clamps,  ground  rod  connectors,  test  clamps,  split  bolts,  andexothermic  welding. toaccommodate the voltage and current required for the testing.  All  wire  and  connections  must  be  made 3.10.5.7.  Before any power  is applied,  it is  essential  to  obtain  the as  foundpotential  data  of  the  structure.    The  native  potential  must  be  tested  for  alllocations  to  be  tested  during  the  current  requirement  test,  to  obtain  thepotential shift accomplished by the test current.3.10.5.8.  Beginning  at  a  low  voltage  setting,  turn  power  on.    Ensure  thepotential shift of the structure is in the negative direction.  Gradually increasevoltage and current to desired output.  Periodically check potential to ensure acorresponding  negative  shift  occurs  as  current  is  increased.      If  maximumvoltage  is  reached  and  more  current  is  still  required,  turn  system  off.Supplement  the  temporary  anode  bed.    Consider  using  multiple  powersources and/or multiple temporary anode beds.3.10.5.9.  Sufficient  current  is  applied  when  a  substantial  section  of  thestructure  to  be  tested has  achieved  a  noticeable  potential  shift  or  when  fullprotection is achieved.3.10.5.10.  If full protection is achieved, the current requirement is the sameas the test current.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999723.10.5.11.  If full protection is not achieved, further calculations are required:3.10.5.12.  Once the potential shift is ascertained, and the current to get thatshift  is  known,  approximation  of  the  actual  current  requirement  can  becalculated.3.10.5.13.  If  the  current  is  doubled,  the  potential  shift  can  be  expected  toapproximately double.3.10.5.14.  Current  distribution  should  be  considered.    If  good  currentdistribution  is  achieved,  a  simple  mathematical  formula  would  produce  thecurrent requirement.    If  proper  current distribution  is not achieved  with  thetemporary  system,  proper  current  distribution  must  be  considered  in  thedesign.3.10.5.15.  If  a  current  requirement  test  includes  more  than  one  anode  bedlocation, all current sources should be interrupted simultaneously to measurethe potential shift of the structure:3.10.5.15.1.  The  total  current  requirement  is  found  by  adding  the  currentfrom all power sources together.3.10.5.15.2.  Always  consider  proper  current  distribution  and  estimate  therequired current requirement for each individual system.3.10.5.16.  Upon completion of testing, turn all power sources off; disconnectall cables, and remove temporary anodes.  For ease of removal of ground rodsor  small  diameter  pipes  and  conduit,  use  three  flat  metal  bars  as  shown  inMIL HDBK 1136.3.11.  Electrolyte Resistivity Measurement.3.11.1.  The most common unit of resistivity is Ohm-centimeters.3.11.2.  Many  factors in the  operation  of  CP  systems are  dependent  upon  theresistivity of the electrolyte:AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999733.11.2.1.  Resistance to earth of anodes is directly proportional to the resistivityof the electrolyte.3.11.2.2.  The  corrosivity  of  the  environment is  higher  when  the  resistivity  islower.3.11.2.3.  The output of both galvanic anodes and impressed current anodes isdependent upon the resistivity of the electrolyte.3.11.3.  Four Pin Method:  The most commonly used means of measuring soilresistivity is by the four pin method.3.11.3.1.  In this method, a current is passed through two outer electrodes and adrop in potential through the soil due to the passage of the current is measuredwith a second pair of inner electrodes.3.11.3.2.  A  specialized instrument is  used to  supply  the  current  and  measurethe potential drop (figure 3.5).3.11.3.3.  In order to reduce the influence of any stray currents in the area, theinstrument uses a unique 90 cycle square wave.3.11.3.4.  The  electrodes  should  be  arranged  in  a  straight  line,  with  equalspacing between all electrodes (figure 3.6).3.11.3.5.  The electrodes should be inserted into the ground at an equal depth,normally 4 inches.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199974Figure  3.5.

Using Four Pin Method to Measure Soil Resistivity.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999753.11.3.6.  The soil resistivity is calculated from the indicated reading by usingthe following formula:Resistivity (Ohm-cm) = 191.5 x pin spacing (in feet) x meter reading.3.11.3.7.  In  this  method,  the  average  resistivity  of  the  soil  between  the  twocenter electrodes to a depth equal to the pin spacing is measured.  Readings arenormally  taken  at  approximately  2.5’,  5’  and  10’  (see  chart  below  for  usingcommon multipliers).

If  the  average  soil  resistivity  decreases  at  greater  depths  then  theactual soil resistivity at that depth is lower than indicated.3.11.3.10.  To  calculate  approximate  resistivities  at  depth  use  the  BarnesMethod formula (table 3.3).  The Barnes method gives an approximation  ofthe average resistivity for a specific depth range.  The change in the reciprocalof the resistivity of two layers is used to estimate the lower level.Table 3.3.

Two  Pin  Method.    In  the  two  pin  method  the  potential  drop  ismeasured between the same pair of electrodes used to supply the current.  Theequipment used to make this type of measurement is often called the "ShepardCanes" after its inventory.  The probes are placed one foot apart.  If the soil istoo hard for the probes to penetrate the reading is taken at the  bottom  of twoaugured holes.  The instrument is calibrated for a probe spacing of one foot andgives a reading directly in Ohm-cm.  This method  is:3.11.4.1.  Less accurate than the four pin method.3.11.4.2.  Measures the resistivity of the soil only near the surface.3.11.4.3.  Often used for preliminary surveys.3.11.4.4.  Quicker than using the four pin method.3.11.5.  Other Methods (Soil Rod, Soil Box).  A soil rod is essentially a two pinresistivity measuring device where the electrodes are both mounted on a singlerod.  Like the other two pin method, the resistivity of the soil to a very shallowdepth is measured.  Also, the soil must be soft enough to allow penetration ofthe rod.  Measurements using the soil rod can, however, be made quickly whenmaking measurements in soft soil.3.11.5.1.  Soil  samples  can  be  taken  and  the  resistivity  of  the  sample  can  bedetermined by the use of a soil box.3.11.5.2.  The measurement made on the soil sample is essentially the four pinmethod.3.11.5.3.  Metal contacts in each end of the box are used to pass current throughthe sample.3.11.5.4.  Potential drop is measured across probes inserted into the soil.3.11.5.5.  The  resistivity  is  calculated  using  constants  furnished  with  theparticular size of soil box being used.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999783.11.5.6.  Soil boxes are commonly designed with a multiplier of 1.3.11.5.7.  Soil box problems.3.11.5.7.1.  Due to the disturbance of the soil compaction will be different.3.11.5.7.2.  The sample may dry out during shipment.3.11.5.7.3.  To minimize drying out of samples they should be placed in plasticbags and sealed prior to shipment.3.11.5.7.4.  Less likely  to represent true in place soil resistivity than an actualfield test.3.12.  pH Testing Procedures.  The pH of an electrolyte is a measure of theacidity or alkalinity of the electrolytic solution.3.12.1.  pH ranges from 0 to 14:  0-7 being acidic; 7  being neutral., and 7-14being alkaline.3.12.2.  pH can be measured using several methods.3.12.2.1.  Antimony  electrode  test  method.    Antimony  is  a  unique  metalwhich has  a  direct  relationship  between  the  pH  and  its  measured  potential.The  potential  difference  or  voltage  developed  between  antimony  and  acopper/copper sulfate reference electrode varies from approximately 0.1 voltsDC to 0.7 volts DC due to variations in the pH.  Consequently it can be usedto  determine  the  pH  of  the  electrolyte  when  used  in  conjunction  with  thisreference electrode.3.12.2.2.  The antimony electrode must be cleaned prior to each use.  Specialcleaning  procedures  must  be  used.    Clean  the  antimony  electrode  as  perinstructions  in  MIL  HDBK  1136,  Cleaning  of  the  Electrode.    Antimony  isvery brittle, treat it carefully.  The antimony tip must be kept smooth, theremust be no rough surface or pits.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999793.12.2.3.  Place the antimony electrode and the copper/copper sulfate half cellin  contact  with  the  electrolyte  and measure  the  potential  difference  using  ahigh input resistance voltmeter.3.12.2.4.  The  measurement stabilization is much slower in acid solutions than in alkaline solutions.takes  several  seconds to  stabilize; this3.12.2.5.  Avoid taking these measurements with CP current on.  Current flowin the electrolyte will affect the accuracy.  If current flow cannot be stopped,place  the  two  electrodes  close  together,  perpendicular  to  the  direction  ofcurrent  flow.    To  measure  for  the  presence  of  any  current  flow  in  theelectrolyte.  Place one copper/copper sulfate half cell in the electrolyte.  Placea second copper/copper sulfate half cell a few inches from the other referencecell.  Measure the potential difference using a high input resistance voltmeter.Take  measurements  in  several  directions.    If  no  current  is  present,  themeasurements  will  read  the  same.    If  current  is  present,  the  lowestmeasurement will be where the least amount of current is flowing.3.12.3.  Chemical  test  method:    Chemical  test  methods  are  normallyassociated with liquid electrolyte samples.3.12.3.1.  Chemical  methods  of  measuring  pH  involve  either  the  use  of  pHmeasuring electrodes or indicators whose colors are dependent on pH.3.12.3.2.  A  pH  meter  measures  the  difference  in  potential  between  a  pHinsensitive reference electrode and an electrode whose potential is sensitive topH.3.12.3.3.  Colored indicators are normally used in the form of pH papers.3.12.3.4.  The  paper  is  wetted  with  the  solution  being  measured  and  theresulting color is compared with color standards to determine the pH.3.12.3.5.  When  chemical meters  or indicators are used to measure the  pH  ofsoil  the  following  procedure  is  used.    A  small  amount  of  soil  (one  or  twoAFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199980tablespoons)  is  placed  in  a  clean  container.    If  the  sample  has  a  moisturecontent  under  20%,  a  very  small  amount  of  distilled  water  is  added.    Afterstirring, the mixture is allowed to settle.  The pH of the liquid is measured.3.13.  Calibration of IR Drop Test Span.  The IR drop test span is a type ofCP test station which is vital for determination of the direction and magnitudeof DC current flowing through a pipeline.3.13.1.  In protected pipelines, this information can be used to verify currentdistribution  and  look  for  stray  or  interference  current  and  the  area  ofinfluence of installed rectifiers.3.13.2.  In unprotected pipelines, this information can be used to find anodicareas and discharge or pickup areas of stray or interference currents.3.13.3.  This method uses the metallic pipeline  or  cable  as a  shunt  which  isthen  calibrated and  used  to measure  a  Millivolt  "IR  Drop",  from  which  thecurrent can be calculated.3.13.3.1.  A  known  amount  of  DC  current  is  applied  to  the  pipeline.    Thevoltage drop across the length is measured.3.13.3.2.  The resistance can be calculated if the length and wall thickness ofthe  pipeline  test  span  is  accurately  known.    See  table  3.4  to  estimate  theresistance of the test span.3.13.3.3.  The line current can be calculated using ohms law, E = I * R, whereE is the measured voltage drop, R is the Resistance of the test span.3.13.4.  One other method for determining the direction and magnitude of DCcurrent flowing through a pipeline is to use a clamp-on milliammeter.  Thismethod requires a very specialized piece of equipment, sized to the pipeline,and an excavation or access to the pipeline, for placement of the probe aroundthe pipeline.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999813.13.5.  Do not use an ohmmeter to measure the resistance of the pipeline orcable.3.13.5.1.  The  current  flowing  on  pipeline  or  cable  will  flow  through  themeter and damage could result.3.13.5.2.  If that current does not damage the meter, the measurement wouldnot indicate a true resistance value.  The voltage would be interpreted by themeter  as  coming  from  the  internal  battery  instead  of  the  external  electricalcircuit being measured.3.13.6.  The preferred method is to measure the actual resistance of the pipeusing test current.  This method:3.13.6.1.  Does not require knowledge of the pipeline size.3.13.6.2.  Does not require knowledge of the pipeline wall thickness.3.13.6.3.  Is  not  affected  by  variations  in  the  metal  due  to  composition  orcorrosion.3.13.6.4.  Is not affected by variations of resistance due to temperature.3.13.6.5.  Is not affected by inaccurate lengths of the test span.3.13.6.6.  The amount of test current required depends on the diameter of thepipeline and the distance of the test span.3.13.6.7.  The larger the pipeline, the larger the amount of current required.3.13.6.8.  The shorter the distance of the test  span,  the larger  the amount  ofcurrent required.3.13.7.  Calibration  of  an  IR  Drop  test  span  consists  of  two  measurementcircuits.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999823.13.7.1.  The outside circuit consists of:3.13.7.1.1.  An Ammeter to measure the current.3.13.7.1.2.  A DC power supply.3.13.7.1.3.  An on/off switch.3.13.7.1.4.  Some means of adjustment.3.13.7.1.5.  A portable rectifier may be used as the current source, switch andthe means of adjustment.3.13.7.2.  The  inside  circuit  consists  of  a  Millivolt  Meter,  connected  acrossthe test span.3.13.8.  Pipelines and cables inherently will have current flowing at all times.Therefore, a change in voltage drop measurement is compared to the amountof test current applied.3.13.9.  Following  all  polarities,  connect  all  circuit  components.    Polarity  isimportant for correct determination of the direction of the current flow in thepipeline or cable during subsequent test procedures.3.13.10.  With Outside Circuit switch off, record the mV measurement of theinside circuit.  Starting at a low current level:3.13.10.1.  Turn the outside circuit switch on.3.13.10.2.  Adjust current up to the desired test current.3.13.10.3.  Record the measurement of the test current.3.13.11.  With Outside Circuit remaining on, record the mV measurement ofthe inside circuit.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999833.13.12. Apply this data to the following formulas:Resistance =Factor =Voltage On – Voltage Off*Test Current appliedTest Current appliedVoltage Change*3.13.13.  Voltage Change must consider polarity.3.13.13.1.  For example, 4.1 mV on, minus 1.3 mV off, is a voltage change of2.8 mV.3.13.13.2.  Whereas, 4.1 mV on, minus  -1.3 mV  off,  is  a  voltage  change  of5.4 mV.3.13.13.3.  (+ mV ON - -mV OFF = +mV ON + mV OFF = Voltage Change).3.13.14.  Record  the  resistance  of  the  test  span  and  the  calibration  factorestablished.  If the temperature of the pipeline or cable remains constant, thiscalibration factor can be stenciled on the IR Drop Test Station and used forfuture  measurements.    If  doubt  exists  or  temperatures  change,  perform  thecalibration steps each time measurements are taken.3.13.15.  Direction  of  current  flow  is  determined  by  the  polarity  of  the  mVreading  taken  on  the  inside  circuit,  with meter  positive  on left, negative  onright.    A  positive  IR  Drop  indicates  current  flow  from  left  to  right.    Anegative IR Drop would indicate current flow from right to left.3.13.16.  The resistance of the pipeline can be calculated if the distance of thetest  span  is  known  and  the  size  of  the  pipeline  is  accurately  known.Resistance  joints  or  insulators  cannot  be  present  on  the  pipeline  in  the  testspan.    Variations in  temperature  will adversely  affect  the  accuracy  of  thesecalculations.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999843.13.17.  The mV IR Drop is measured by using a Voltmeter on the mV scale.Following all polarities, connect the meter to the inside circuit and record themeasurement.  Polarity is important for correct determination of the directionof the current flow in the pipeline or cable during subsequent test procedures.3.13.18.  The resistance is estimated using table 3.4.Table 3.4.

The resistance  is  given  in  millionths  of  an  ohm  (.000001  ohms)per linear foot of pipeline.3.13.18.2.  This resistance value must be multiplied by the number of feet inthe test span (distance in feet  of  the  pipeline  between  the  actual  connectionpoints of the test station leads to the pipeline).3.13.19. This data is then applied to the following formula:Current =mV IR DropResistance3.13.20.  The direction of the current flow is determined from the polarity ofthe  mV  IR  Drop  reading  measured.    For  example,  a  positive  IR  Dropindicates  current  flow  from  right  to  left,  while  a  negative  IR  Drop  wouldindicate current flow from left to right.3.13.21.  The  Multi-Combination  meter  has  the  capability  of  measuringcurrent by the "Null Ammeter Method".  This meter can safely measure linecurrents under  2  amps.   Do not  use  this  method  in  areas  which  has  over  2amps  of  line  current.    Stray  current  variations  or  other  fluctuations  in  themeasurement may make keeping the meter nulled to obtain  an accurate andreliable  measurement  too  difficult.    This  method  does  not  require  anyinformation  on  the  length  of  the  test  span,  diameter  of  the  structure,  or  thetype of metal being tested.3.14.    Interference  Testing  Procedures.    When  current  flows  through  anelectrolyte, it follows the path of least electrical resistance.  If a metal structureis  immersed  in  the  current  carrying  electrolyte,  it  is  likely  to  present  a  lowresistance path for the flow of current.  At the point where electrons enter thestructure  from the  electrolyte  corrosion  will  be  accelerated.    Where  electronsleave the structure, corrosion will be reduced.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999863.14.1.  This  phenomenon  is  called  Cathodic  Interference.   Cathodicinterference  is  commonly  encountered  on  buried  structures  and  can  bedetected by electrical measurements and can be controlled.3.14.2.  CP sometimes causes undesirable effects on structures not connectedto the protection system.  This occurs because some current is picked up bythese  "foreign"  structures  at  one  point,  and  in  attempting  to  return  to  thesource and complete the circuit, is discharged at another point.3.14.3.  Corrosion  occurs at  the  current  discharge  point.    Current  can  causecorrosion damage by passing between two structures or across high-resistancejoints in the same structure.3.14.4.  Sources  of  Interference  Currents  may  be  constant  or  fluctuating.Constant current sources have essentially constant direct current output, suchas CP rectifiers and thermoelectric generators.3.14.5.  Fluctuating  current  sources  have  a  fluctuating  direct  current  outputsuch as direct current electrified railway systems, coal mine haulage systemsand  pumps,  welding  machines,  direct  current  power  systems,  and  telluriccurrents.3.14.6.  See MIL HDBK 1136, section 2.2.4 for explanations and sources ofinterference current.3.14.7.  Mitigation  can  usually  be  accomplished  by  installing  an  electricalbond  between  the  unprotected  structure  (at  the  location  of  maximumdischarge) and the protected structure.3.14.8.  Other  mitigation  methods  include  breaking  the  continuity  of  theforeign  pipeline,  coating  the  foreign  pipeline  pickup  area,  coating  theprotected  pipeline  in  the  discharge  area  of  the  foreign  pipeline,  and  use  ofgalvanic anodes to apply current to the discharge area of the foreign pipeline(and an alternate current discharge point).AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999873.14.9.  See  section  MIL  HDBK  1136,  section  5.6  for  information  onInterference Corrosion Control.3.14.10.  Interference from CP rectifiers:3.14.10.1.  CPs  systems are a  major  source  of  stray  current  on  other  metallicstructures.3.14.10.2.  Structures not electrically connected to the protected structures areconsidered to be "foreign" structures.3.14.10.3.  A foreign structure may provide an alternate path  for the  currentflowing from the impressed current anodes to a protected structure.3.14.10.4.  If  this  path  is  of  sufficiently  low  resistance,  significant  currentflow will occur.3.14.10.5.  Since  there  is no  metallic return  path,  the  current  will  dischargefrom the surface of the foreign structure to the electrolyte in order to return toits source, resulting in severe corrosion.3.14.10.6.  Testing  requires  cooperation  by  the  owners  of  the  structuresinvolved.3.14.10.6.1.  Such  cooperation  is  best  effected  by  a  corrosion  coordinatingcommittee;  all  companies  operating  underground  or  underwater  structures,and particularly those under CP, should be members of such a committee.3.14.10.6.2.  A  list  of  most  existing  committees  may  be  obtained  from  theNational Association of Corrosion Engineers, P.O. Box 218340 Houston, TX,77218-8340.3.14.10.7.  Interference testing is usually performed when new CP systems arefirst installed but is sometimes detected through routine field measurements.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999883.14.10.8.  Good  record  keeping  is  very  useful  in  preventing  cathodicinterference  problems  as  any  system  changes,  particularly  additions  of  newburied structures, can be more easily determined when proper records are kept.3.14.10.9.  Interference tests must be made on all structures adjacent to a CPsystem  to  determine  effects  and  to  allow  design  of  mitigation  measures.Cathodic  interference  can  be  detected  by  measuring  structure-to-soilpotentials, potential gradients and current flow (IR drop) with CP current orresistance  bonds  on  and/or  cycled  on  and  off.    Structure-to-soil  potentialsgive  indications  of  interference  only  when  measured  in  an  area  of  currentdischarge or pick-up on the foreign structure.3.14.10.10.  Abnormal or unusual current distribution on a protected structureindicates possible interference on a foreign structure.3.14.10.11.  Current  flow  (IR  drop)  readings  show  the  relationship  betweenpick-up and discharge areas on a foreign structure.3.14.10.12.  A  CP  rectifier  output  contains  a  waveform,  which  results  in  apulsating DC signal.3.14.10.13.  Presence  of  this  pulsating  DC  on  foreign  structures  indicatesinterference from a rectifier.3.14.10.14.  When conducting current requirement tests or initially energizingimpressed current CP systems, all companies owning underground structuresin  the  area  should  be  notified  and  coordination  tests  made  with  thoseinterested.3.14.10.15.  Current  drainage  requirements  for  each  structure,  from  tests  atvarious anode locations, can be determined.3.14.11.  The best  method  to  locate  interference  is to  perform  a pipe-to-soilpotential  survey  of  the  foreign  pipeline  with  the  source  of  the  interferencecycled on and off at specific intervals.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999893.14.11.1.  The  algebraic  difference  between  the  "on"  and  "off"  reading(potential shift) gives the interference effect on the foreign structure.3.14.11.2.  The location showing greatest pipe-to-soil potential change in thepositive ("unprotected") direction is called the "critical" or "control" point.3.14.11.3.  This  is  often  at  the  point  where  protected  and  unprotectedpipelines  cross.    The  areas  showing  pipe-to-soil  potential  change  in  thenegative ("protected") direction are called "pickup" areas.3.14.11.4.  Presence  of  a  pickup  area  on  a  foreign  structure  indicates  thatinterference  is  present,  and  a  discharge  area  exists  somewhere  on  thatstructure.3.14.11.5.  If metallic continuity exists between the foreign structure and thenegative terminal of the rectifier, this is not interference, it is protection, andno  discharge  area  exists  (and  therefore,  by  definition  is  not  a  foreignstructure).3.14.12.  If  the  source  of  the  cathodic  interference  is  not  known,  it  can  bedetected  by  measuring  structure-to-soil  potentials  with  CP  current  on  andpotential gradients.3.14.13.  Structure-to-soil  potentials  give  indications  of  interference  onlywhen  measured  in  an  area  of  current  discharge  or  pick-up  on  the  foreignstructure. Potential gradients are measured by the cell-to-cell test proceduresin paragraph 3.5.3.14.14.  Taking  these  measurements  along  the  foreign  pipeline  may  locatethe discharge point and pickup areas.3.14.14.1.  The  polarity  must  be  ascertained  to  determine  the  direction  ofcurrent  flow  and  magnitude.    Current  will  flow  in  the  direction  of  thedischarge point.  The magnitude will increase as you near the discharge point.3.14.14.2.  The  direction  will  reverse  upon  passing  a  discharge  point.    Thereversal with the highest magnitude is the "control" or "critical" point.  TheAFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199990discharge  point  is  normally  near  the  structure,  which  is  causing  theinterference.3.14.14.3.  The  pickup  area  is  normally  near  the  anode  system,  which  iscausing the interference.  Locating the pickup area is important in locating thesource  of  the  interference,  since  it  shows  the  direction  that  the  current  iscoming from.3.14.15.  Measurement of the current flow (IR drop) on a foreign pipeline canbe accomplished if other methods are inconclusive.3.14.15.1.  Current  flow  (IR  drop)  readings  show  the  relationship  betweenpick-up and discharge areas on a foreign structure.3.14.15.2.  By measuring the current flow on a foreign structure, the directionof the discharge point and pickup areas can be determined.3.14.15.3.  Magnitude indicates seriousness, and increases as  the  distance  tothe discharge point decreases.3.14.15.4.  These  measurements  can  be  easily  accomplished  if  IR  drop  teststations already exist or if the pipeline is accessible (comes aboveground orpasses through pits).3.14.15.5.  Current is measured at  an  IR  drop test  station  by  the  proceduresdetailed in paragraph 3.13.3.14.15.6.  Current is measured where access to the pipeline is possible usinga clamp-on milliammeter (such as the Swain CP AmpClip).  The correct sizeclamp  must  be  used  for  the  pipeline  under  test.    Note:    Typical  clamp-onmeters do not work in this application, it must be capable of measuring DCamps, with a range capable of accurate measurement of under 30 milliamps.3.14.16.  Abnormal  or  unusual  current  distribution  on  a  protected  structureindicates possible interference on a foreign structure.  Normally the potentialof  a  protected  structure  decreases  slightly  as  distance  from  the  anodesAFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 199991increases.    At  defects  in  coatings  the  potential  of  a  protected  structuredecreases.  An increase in potential normally indicates current pickup.  If thepotential of a protected pipeline increases when  crossing  a  foreign  pipeline,interference  is  likely  on  that  structure.    Potential  survey  of  that  structure,while  interrupting  the  source  of  current  will  indicate  the  presence  andmagnitude of that interference.3.14.17.  A  CP  rectifier  output  contains  a  waveform,  which  results  in  apulsating DC signal.3.14.17.1.  This  signal  can  be  located  using  a  pipe  locator  capable  offollowing a 120 cycles per second (cps) signal (such as the Pipe Horn, Model200 FDAC, in rectifier mode).3.14.17.2.  Presence  of  this  signal  indicates  presence  of  interference  on  theforeign structure.3.14.17.3.  Combining  this  method  with  a  current  interrupter  on  suspectedsources  of  the  interference  will  expeditiously  locate  the  source  of  theinterference.3.14.17.4.  Signal strength can sometimes be used to indicate the direction ofthe discharge and pickup areas.3.14.17.5.  Normally  signal  strength  will  increase  in  the  direction  of  thedischarge point.  This may not occur with multiple discharge areas.3.14.18.  Another  method  of  interference  testing  is  to  use  an  experimentaldrainage bond between structures.3.14.18.1.  Proper  drainage  can  be  determined  by  trial-and-error,  using  avariable resistor to alter drainage current.3.14.18.2.  Required drainage current can also be computed from test data.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999923.14.18.3.  When  the  same  owner  maintains  the  protected  structure  and  theforeign structure, this method may be easily used.3.14.18.4.  The source of interference is cycled on and off at specific intervalsand  the  bond  resistance  is  adjusted  until  no  potential  shift  occurs  on  theforeign structure.3.14.18.5.  When  site  conditions  warrant,  the  bond  may  be  sized  to  applypartial or full protection to the foreign structure.3.14.18.6.  If the foreign structure is small or well coated, and  the protectedstructure  is  poorly  coated,  this  option  may  be  taken  when  sufficient  CPcurrent is still available to maintain protection on the protected structure.3.14.19.  Interference from variable (fluctuating) sources.  While interferencetesting  determines  effects  of  steady  stray  currents,  another  type  of  straycurrent  survey  analyzes  fluctuating  stray  currents.    Fluctuating  or  periodicchanges in structure-to-electrolyte voltage values  and  unusual  or  fluctuatingcurrents are indicative of stray currents.3.14.19.1.  Stray  currents may  affect  structures  just  as  CP  does.    Structuresmay  be  protected  or  damaged  by  stray  DC  currents,  depending  on  whethercurrent is flowing to or from the structure.3.14.19.2.  Such  analysis  is  specialized  and  requires  study  to  master  alltechniques.3.14.19.3.  The basic principles are the  same  as  in  the  previous  section  (seeabove).  The difference is that the stray DC current is not present at the samelocation all the time.  DC current pick-up and discharge areas are constantlychanging.3.14.19.4.  The use of data loggers or recording devices at many points on theforeign  structure,  simultaneously,  will  indicate  the  same  information  asabove.3.14.19.5.  Locating the discharge point(s) and pickup areas are still crucial.AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999933.14.19.6.  In  this  case,  determining  the  time  of  the  interference  is  alsocrucial.3.14.20.  All the basic measurements can be used in studying fluctuating straycurrents.    Perhaps  the  most  informative  are  measurements  similar  to  thoseused  in  interference  testing;  structure-to-electrolyte  potentials  and  IR  dropsalong  structure  or  electrolyte.    Methods  of  analysis,  however,  are  differentand specialized equipment is used.  The major concern in performing a straycurrent survey is to find out the degree of damage and determine the sourceof the stray DC current.3.14.21.  Measurement of the foreign pipeline potentials is commonly used todetermine the pickup and discharge areas.3.14.21.1.  Using  data  loggers  or  recording  devices,  many  locations  on  theforeign structure are monitored simultaneously.3.14.21.2.  This  data  is  then  charted  to  analyze  for  the  presence  ofinterference.3.14.21.3.  When  the  exact  moment  of  interference  is  determined,  allpotential  readings  taken  at  that  instant  are  used  to  determine  the  dischargeand pickup points.3.14.21.4.  Data taken is used to locate areas for taking additional data.3.14.21.5.  Once gathered, this data is used exactly like the data for cathodicinterference detailed previously.3.14.21.6.  Abnormal  potentials  on  other  structures  may  also  be  used  forfurther analysis.3.14.21.7.  Once  the  pickup  area  and  time  is  determined,  the  source  of  thecurrent  may  be  located  (see  MIL  HDBK  1136,  section  2.2.4  for  sources  offluctuating stray currents).AFH 32-1290(I)/MIL-HDBK-1136/1  1 February 1999943.14.22.  Another  method  of  finding  these  points  is measurements.through  current3.14.22.1.  In  order  to  determine  the  pick-up  and  discharge  points  influctuating stray current areas, data from several test points are plotted over aperiod of time.3.14.22.2.  Current  values  on  the  several  locations  on  the  foreign  structure(recorded  from  IR  drop  test  spans  or  a  clamp-on  milliammeter)  are  plottedover a period of time.3.14.22.3.  The  current  must  be  measured  at  several  points  simultaneously,sufficient readings being made to cover the range of variation of the current(usually at least 24 hours) using recording voltmeters and or data loggers.3.14.22.4.  By analyzing the current direction and magnitude at the time theinterference  is  occurring,  the  relationship  and  direction  of  the  pickup  areasand discharge areas can be determined.3.14.22.5.  Once the time of interference is known, the area of pickup can besearched  for  possible  sources  of  the  current  pickup  (see  MIL  HDBK  1136,section 2.2.4 for sources of fluctuating stray currents).3.14.22.6.  Outside  of  the  necessity  of  taking  simultaneous  readings  due  tothe fluctuating current, this method is the same  as  conventional  line  currentmeasurement.WILLIAM P.
