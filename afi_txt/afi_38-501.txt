The  following  guidelines  are  provided  to  assist  survey  requestors  in developing survey projects. 3.2.  Pre-Development. 3.2.1.  Survey  requestors  should  discuss  survey  plans  with  the  AF  Survey  Office  before developing a survey to avoid expenditure of monies and duplication of survey projects and to coordinate timelines/ schedules between survey efforts. 3.2.2.  All  survey collection tools administered via the commercial internet  (.net,  .com,  etc) must be in accordance with AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet Use, Section 3.7.4.1.  To maintain the security, integrity, and accountability of Air Force information on the Web, most  public  web  sites  are  managed  through  the  Air  Force  Public  Information  Management System and private Air Force Web sites through the Air Force portal.  Any Air Force Web site hosted on a commercial server (outside the .mil community) requires SAF/XC approval. 3.3.  Survey Utility.  To ensure effective survey research, surveys should: 3.3.1.  Contribute significantly to the study of relevant Air Force policy or program issues. 3.3.2.  Not merely gather information to meet requirements for award of an academic degree or serve as a springboard for future research. 3.3.3.  Result  in  expected  benefits  to  the  Air  Force  clearly  outweighing  the  potential  costs (e.g., negative publicity, damage to morale or readiness, time burden on respondents). 3.3.4.  Contain  questions  and  issues  of  an  appropriate  length  to  avoid  survey  fatigue.    In addition, certain populations (e.g., deployed members) tend to be surveyed more; therefore, surveys of those populations may be disapproved for that reason. 3.4.  Respondent  Anonymity  and  Confidentiality.  Use administrative procedures that protect participant’s responses and identity IAW AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program. 3.5.  Target  Population.  Identify  demographics  of  the  targeted  population  and  calculate  the appropriate sample size from which to capture survey responses (i.e., military, civilian, skill sets, rank, grade, etc.) 3.5.1.  Determine  if  survey-sampling  techniques  can  be  used  to  provide  valid  and  reliable information at greatly reduced costs and time burdens on Air Force personnel.  Surveys that include all members of a target population are discouraged. 3.5.1.1.  Select an appropriate sample size to ensure survey results represent the attitudes and opinions of the target population. 3.5.1.2.  Sample the minimum number of respondents necessary to reasonably achieve a satisfactory confidence interval. 3.5.2.  Exclude participation of contract employees, which is not authorized for government-sponsored surveys.   6  AFI38-501  12 MAY 2010 3.5.3.  Notify the Civilian Personnel Office at each participating Civilian Personnel Element, Manpower  &  Personnel  Flight,  for  labor  union  notification  prior  to  releasing  an  approved survey  to  civilian  employees.    For  surveys  of  civilians  at  more  than  one  base,  HQ AFPC/DPIECC, Air Force Program Management and Evaluation, must be notified. 3.6.  Survey Questions. 3.6.1.  Should not be of a sensitive nature, objectionable, or in bad taste. 3.6.2.  Should not require a lot of time and effort to respond. 3.6.3.  Should be grammatically correct and easily understood by the respondents. 3.6.4.  Do  not  include  survey  questions  not  intended  for  public  release.    Treat  each  survey question  as  though  results  will  be  released  to  the  public.    Consider  the  potential  impact  of public  release  on  the  following  groups:    Active  duty  personnel  and  their  families;  Air National  Guard  and  Air  Force  Reserve  members;  Civilian  employees;  Service  academy members;  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps  (ROTC)  cadets  and  auxiliary;  Retired  military personnel  and  their  families;  Community  organizations  (including  civic,  trade,  industrial, veterans,  youth,  ethnic,  women,  religious,  environmental,  and  educational  groups);  The Congress;  Local,  state,  and  Federal  Government  officials;  Professional  organizations  (e.g., partnerships,  associations,  corporations,  business  trusts,  legal  representatives,  organized groups of individuals); and Civic leaders. 3.7.  Questionnaire Package, Format, and Structure. 3.7.1.  Cover  letter  or  instructions  should  contain  a  statement  that  the  survey  is  anonymous and  that  individual  responses  will  be  kept  confidential,  but  summarized  responses  may  be released to the public. 3.7.2.  If  copyrighted  scales,  subscales,  or  questions  are  used,  the  requester  must  have permission from the author(s) (if required) and cite the author(s) in any subsequent report or summary. Questions concerning copyright issues can be directed to AFLOA/JACQ, Rosslyn, Virginia. 3.7.3.  Each topic area should be covered adequately. 3.7.4.  Questions should be in a logical sequence. 3.7.5.  Questionnaire should present a neat, professional appearance. 3.7.6.  Obtain  approval  and  endorsement  on  all  survey  requests  from  HQ  USAF  functional authority (minimum three-letter office).  This ensures effective research is conducted across the  Air  Force  while  reducing  duplication  of  similar  efforts.    Survey  requests  will  not  be approved without this endorsement. 3.8.  Response Scales 3.8.1.  When using response scales, they must be balanced (e.g., when positive and negative responses  are  called  for,  there  should  be  equal  numbers  of  responses  on  both  sides  of  the neutral point, whether the neutral point is explicit or implied). 3.8.2.  Response scales should be complete, covering the full range of possible answers.  An "I don’t know," "None of the above," "N/A," or "Neither/Nor" response may be necessary. AFI38-501  12 MAY 2010   7  3.8.3.  Responses  should  be  mutually  exclusive  and  when  covering  a  continuous  variable such as time, weight, etc., they should be all-inclusive as well. 3.9.  Prohibited Survey Topics.  Surveys that might prove harmful to mission accomplishment if the results are disclosed to the public, or surveys covering areas of possible intelligence value are prohibited. 3.10.  Inappropriate  Survey  Topics.  Surveys  on  the  following  topics  are  normally  prohibited and will only be approved on a case-by-case basis. 3.10.1.  Political views. 3.10.2.  Knowledge or skill assessments. 3.10.3.  Opinions about specific individuals or their job performance. 3.11.  Survey Projects Exempt or Not Supported. 3.11.1.  Occupational  surveys  which  are  assigned  an  Air  Force  Personnel  Test  number  and controlled according to AFI 36-2623, Occupational Analysis. 3.11.2.  Internal reporting requirements, including statistical, summary, or status information which  must  be  licensed  and  approved  with  a  Reports  Control  Symbol  (RCS)  number  in accordance  with  AFI  33-324,  Management  and  Control  of  Information  Reports Requirements. 3.11.3.  Surveys of course graduates, administered on-site, if the sole purpose is to ask about the course.  Surveys administered after completion of course, and mailed to graduates or their supervisors, are subject to requirements outlined in Chapter 4. 3.11.4.

Surveys  requiring  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  approval.    Surveys directed to the general public (non-Federal Government employees) require OMB approval.  OMB at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/omb/inforeg/statpolicy/standards_stat_surveys.pdf and http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/pmc_survey_guidance_2006.pdf. guidance is located 3.11.6.  Inspector  General  organizations  completing  surveys  under  the  purview  of  United States Code Title 10, Sec 8020,  Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Inspector General and its implementing AF instructions are exempt from the control measures of this AFI but may utilize the AF Survey Program when appropriate. 3.11.7.  Single-base  surveys  initiated  by  the  installation  or  unit  commander  only  on  issues under his or her control (see paragraph 2.5.). 3.11.8.  All surveys submitted by non-Federal employees and that have no Federal funding or other support will be returned without action. 3.11.9.  Surveys  administered  on  non-dot  mil  web  sites  without  SAF/XC  approval  in accordance with AFI 33-129, Section 3.7.4.1 will not be supported.   8  AFI38-501  12 MAY 2010 Chapter 4 SURVEY REQUESTS 4.1.

Survey not developed requiring partial or full-phased survey support. 4.1.2.1.  AF  Survey  Office  will  periodically  announce  a  data  call  for  survey  projects requiring full-phased support.
