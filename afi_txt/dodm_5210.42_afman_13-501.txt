Original DoD text appears in regular font and added Air Force text appears in bold.  It implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 13-5, Air Force Nuclear Enterprise, for PRP form usage.  No supplemental guidance to this manual is authorized.    It establishes Air Force requirements and policy for the implementation of the PRP to select and maintain reliable individuals to perform duties associated with nuclear weapons.  The PRP applies to active duty, Reserve, and National Guard units possessing nuclear weapons or Nuclear Command and Control systems and equipment, and any activity certified by a Service inspection activity as “nuclear capable.”  Unless otherwise noted, Headquarters Air Force Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration, Functional Authority Division (AF/A10F) is the waiver authority to policies contained in this supplement and the coordination office for any recommended waivers from the AF to DoDM 5210.42.         DoDM 5210.42, January 13, 2015 The PRP is not intended to act as a quality control tool to decertify/disqualify individuals solely for assignment purposes or risk avoidance.  The denial of eligibility or the revocation of certification for assignment to PRP positions is neither a punitive measure nor the basis for disciplinary action (Reference [c]).  The failure of an individual to be certified for assignment to PRP duties does not necessarily reflect unfavorably on the individual’s suitability for assignment to other duties (Reference [c]).  This Supplement requires the collection of information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 and Health Information and Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA).  The authority to collect this information is in Title 10, United States Code, Section 8013.  System of Records Notice F036 AF PC Q, Personnel Data System (PDS), also applies.

PRP is the commander’s program.  The commander is exclusively accountable for determining the fitness for duty of individuals subject to PRP.  DoD Components and subordinate organizations may establish procedures for implementation of this manual but will not establish additional PRP requirements.   security investigations (PSIs), and the PRP continuous evaluation requirement are designed to mitigate risks and protect the nuclear deterrent from insider threats.  As such, PRP-supporting DoD Component heads and supervisors must aid reviewing and certifying officials in their initial and continuing evaluation duties by ensuring they are provided all relevant information on those trusted with PRP duties.   b.  Only those individuals who demonstrate the highest levels of integrity and dependability will be chosen for PRP duties.  PRP ensures that each person trusted with U.S. nuclear weapons, NC2 systems and equipment, PCM, and SNM, in accordance with DoD Directive S-5210.81 (Reference (j)) and Reference (d), meets the highest levels of reliability.  Those trusted with PRP duties have an obligation to report any behavior or circumstance about themselves or others in PRP that may affect reliability or result in an unsafe or insecure condition.     c.  Only certified personnel will be assigned to designated PRP positions.  All PRP positions will be formally designated as either critical or controlled and restricted to the minimum number required to accomplish the mission.  Unless required by other PRP duties, the reviewing official need not be designated as a PRP position.  Examples of typical PRP positions are shown in Appendix 3 to this enclosure.    (Added)(AF)  Administratively qualified members and/or members who are pending certification (PRP Status Code B) should be assigned to designated PRP positions (at gaining assignment).  (T-1)  This is administrative in nature and is not directly related to nuclear surety.   2.  EVALUATION GUIDELINES.  Certifying officials are responsible for ensuring that all military, civilian, and contractor personnel under the terms of their contracts assigned to PRP positions meet all of the requirements of the continuing evaluation process.  Certifying officials must observe the behavior and performance of members certified under PRP on a frequent and consistent basis.  The primary consideration for certifying officials should be that the sum of all observations, including personal and peer observation and reporting, is sufficiently detailed to allow for thorough evaluation of the individual.     equivalent level of confidence in the reliability of personnel whose normal duties do not provide for routine observation, excluding periods of administrative absence (leave, pass, temporary duty, or temporary additional duty).  Individuals certified under PRP must agree that certifying a.  Personnel Not Under Routine Observation.  Certifying officials must maintain an Change 1, 06/27/2016  18     ENCLOSURE 3   (1)  DoD Components will develop procedures and approval authority for personnel not officials and CMAs can review certain information and materials concerning their on- and off-duty activities (medical, mental health, police, employment records, credit reports, etc.). (Added)(AF)  In most cases, individuals will remain certified under their current CO if performing PRP duties while TDY.   under routine observation.  The approval authority may be delegated in writing to a single official of at least O-7 military grade/Senior Executive Service member on the staff.  All exceptions to routine observation will be submitted for review on an annual basis to the DASD(NM).  The certifying official will submit a specific plan outlining the application of the tools outlined in paragraph 2a(2) of this enclosure, tailored to the circumstances of the individual being considered, that provides for the equivalent level of confidence mentioned in paragraphs 1a,b, and c of this enclosure.  (Added)(AF) The AF appointed approval authority is AF/A10.   evaluation, the certifying official must ensure that the individual’s reliability during these times meets PRP requirements.  The certifying official will employ additional means and methods sufficient to assist in that determination, e.g., an additional personal interview, periodic medical records review, additional drug screening, contact with civilian employer of Reserve and National Guard personnel or previous supervisor, service or personnel records review, periodic criminal records and history checks, and credit checks.   (2)  For periods in which a PRP-certified individual was not subject to continuing (a).  (Added)(AF) Guard and Reserve individuals (with the exception of AF AEAOs) who exceed 75 calendar days without performing official duty/training will be removed from PRP duties (Table 2, PDS Code G) and entry control authorities will be notified.  (T-1)  Upon return, the individual’s personnel and medical records will be screened for factors that may affect their suitability for PRP (back to date of the G code) and the CO will conduct an interview.  (T-1)   (b).  (Added)(AF)  PRP-certified individuals who are K-coded for              deployment/TDY/leave for over 30 days are not required to contact their certifying official prior to medical care.  Upon return, the individuals’ records will be screened for factors that may affect suitability for PRP (back to date of K code) and the CO will conduct an interview; this screening and interview will be documented.  (T-1)  Individuals are responsible for informing their CO of any situation that may affect their reliability under PRP.  (T-1)  Recertification is not required.  b.  Medical Care.  When an individual’s performance may be impaired by medical care or the  use of prescribed medication or short-term stress, the certifying official will be notified to decide if the individual needs to be removed from PRP duties for the period of medical care, stress, or use of medication, as determined by the CMA.  (Added)(AF)  Each installation/GSU will establish a MAJCOM approved process to review external healthcare information submitted by members or external provider(s) and/or agencies.  (T-1)  The MTF Referral Management office will provide the PRP-related documents to the CMA in a timely manner.  (T-1)  Change 1, 06/27/2016  19     ENCLOSURE 3   (1)  The CMA is responsible for determining what information qualifies as medical  factors that may affect an individual’s suitability for PRP, and will convey these factors to the certifying official.  DoD Components may establish protocols that may be applied by independent duty medical technicians (IDMTs) at munitions support squadrons and independent duty corpsmen (IDCs) not designated as CMAs. (Added)(AF)  Independent Duty Medical Technicians (IDMTs) may not be CMAs.  (T-1)  (a).  (Added)(AF)  The Lead or Alternate Lead CMA will provide quality control for the medical PRP, and review local MTF PRP processes to include:  training, timeliness and quality of PRP notifications, and communications with other agencies.  (T-1)   (b).  (Added)(AF)  At GSUs without a CMA, the IDMT will consult with the CMA at the servicing MTF to discuss suitability factors that could impact PRP.  (T-1)  The CMA will determine what factors are impacting and the IDMT will convey these factors to the CO.  (T-1)  The IDMT will document the name of the CMA contacted in the medical record.  (T-1)  (2)  A sexual assault victim certified under PRP is eligible for both the Restricted and   Unrestricted reporting options in accordance with DoD Instruction 6495.02 (Reference (k)).  If electing restricted reporting, the victim is required to advise the CMA of any factors that could have an adverse impact on the victim’s performance, reliability, or safety while performing PRP duties.  If necessary, the CMA will inform the certifying official that the person in question should be suspended from PRP status, without revealing the individual is a victim of sexual assault, thus preserving the Restricted Report.  c.  Contractor PRP Continuing Evaluation.  Contractor employees who, under the terms of  the contracts, have been determined eligible by the contract monitor and have been assigned to PRP positions will be annotated in the DoD designated personnel security information system of record (currently Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS)).  Any file documentation that can’t be submitted through JPAS should be submitted to the DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) Division A, 600 10th Street, Suite 160, Ft.

(1)  Conditions that the certifying official should carefully consider include: a.  Personal Conduct.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,   1.  GENERAL.  The following guidelines are established to assist certifying officials in determining the suitability of all personnel subject to PRP.  The ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue an individual’s enrollment in PRP is based on an overall common sense judgment by the certifying official.  Each case must be judged on its own merits, and above all, be consistent with the interests of U.S. national security.  Sexual orientation or preference may not be used as a basis for or a disqualifying factor in determining a person’s eligibility for PRP.  In evaluating the relevance of an individual’s conduct, certifying officials are encouraged to carefully weigh a number of variables in consideration of the whole person concept of determining suitability.  These variables include:   unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not be suitable for enrollment in PRP.           vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duties, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail.           judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.   being confronted with the facts.

(a)  The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of (e)  Known or witting association with persons involved in criminal activity. (b)  Deliberate provision of false or misleading information. (d)  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.

These disorders present suitability concerns for individuals subject to PRP because they may indicate a defect in reliability.  The certifying official will take the necessary actions to ensure that the individual is properly screened both medically and psychologically.  As with all potentially disqualifying medical conditions, the certifying official must decide each case on the specific medical and other pertinent evaluations of the individual involved.  Any suspected suicidal behavior will result in the individual’s suspension from PRP duties pending the results of a mental health assessment.     condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability, or stability.   medical advice relating to treatment of a condition, e.g., failure to take prescribed medication.   unstable behavior.   in his or her judgment or reliability.   impact reliability because he or she has witnessed or experienced personal trauma in the course of his or her duties, including but not limited to such events as family illness or death and violent crime.  When individuals affected by personal trauma seek treatment, the CMA will assess potential impact upon reliability and advise the certifying official accordingly.  The CMA will not disclose the personal circumstance that resulted in trauma, but is required to inform the certifying official of the specific medical or psychological diagnosis and treatment that may potentially impact reliability.  (d)  Information that suggests that the individual’s current behavior indicates a defect (a)  An opinion by a credentialed mental health professional that the individual has a (e)  Information that suggests the individual displays psychological symptoms that (b)  Information that suggests that an individual has failed to follow appropriate (c)  A pattern of high-risk, irresponsible, aggressive, anti-social, or emotionally (1)  Conditions that the certifying official should carefully consider include:           Change 1, 06/27/2016  45     APPENDIX 4 TO ENCLOSURE 3                   (f)  Poor attitude or lack of motivation.

Financial Considerations. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.

Substance use disorder may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an individual’s inability to ensure the safety, security, control, and effectiveness of nuclear weapons.  Pre-Service use of marijuana, hashish, or other cannabis-based product does not necessarily render an individual ineligible for consideration for or retention in a PRP position.  It is incumbent on the certifying official, with CMA consultation, to determine the degree that pre-service use impacts the individual’s reliability.     e.

Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol-related Incidents.  Excessive alcohol consumption  often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of an individual inability to meet their PRP responsibilities to ensure the safety, security, control, and effectiveness of nuclear weapons.  Individuals diagnosed with mild, moderate, or severe alcohol use disorder, or who have been involved in an alcohol related incident will be, at a minimum, suspended from PRP duties.  The certifying official, after consultation with the CMA or conducting an investigation of the circumstances of an incident, will determine the degree to which the diagnosis affects the reliability of the individual being considered for or who is currently under PRP assignment.  Those individuals may be returned to PRP duties after successfully completing a prescribed rehabilitation program or treatment regimen, when they have displayed positive changes in job reliability and lifestyle, and receive a favorable medical prognosis by the CMA.
