Input  and  maintain wastewater NPDES permits in the WET system. (T-0) 4.3.8.1.  Permit Applications.  All permit applications shall be signed IAW 40 CFR Part 122.22  or  applicable  state  or  local  regulation.  For  military  facilities,  the  authorized signatory  authority  is  the  senior  executive  officer;  typically,  this  is  the  Air  Force installation commander having responsibility for the overall operations of the installation. Reports required by permits and other information must be signed and/or certified by the installation commander  except  to  the extent delegations are authorized under applicable Federal or state regulations. (T-0) 4.3.8.2.  Enforcement  Action (HNEA) Process.  Refer to AFI 32-7047 for coordination, processing, and reporting EAs/HNEAs. (T-1) (EA)  and  HN  Enforcement  Action 4.3.8.3.  Pretreatment  Requirements.  Installation  BCEs  shall  develop  pretreatment programs, if required, for wastewater discharges to satisfy pretreatment requirements. See 40 CFR Parts 403 through 471. (T-0) 4.3.8.4.  Discharges  to  POTW  Treatment  Facilities.  Installations  that  discharge  to POTWs are considered as indirect dischargers and are regulated by the POTW authority. Installations  must  comply  with  applicable  POTW  regulations,  permits,  and  contractual agreements.  (T-0) 4.3.8.5.  Discharges  from  FOTW.  Wastewater  point  source  discharges  into  waters  of the U.S. require NPDES permits. (T-0) 4.3.8.6.  Septic  Systems.  The  BCE  ensures  compliance    with  applicable  state  or  local regulations  regarding  septic  systems.  Connect  septic  systems  to  POTWs  or  domestic AFI32-1067  4 FEBRUARY 2015   21  wastewater  systems  to  maintain  compliance.  Industrial  wastewater  shall  not  be discharged to septic systems. (T-0) 4.3.9.  Other Water Discharge Permits. 4.3.9.1.  Dredge  or  Fill  Permits.  CWA  Section  404  requires  a  permit  from  the  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (or authorized state) to discharge dredged or fill material into navigable waters (waters of the U.S., including jurisdictional wetlands that are waters of the U.S.). (T-0) Examples of such activities include depositing of dredged or fill material, site development fill, and construction activities.  4.3.9.2.  Pesticides.  The  CWA  general  NPDES  permit  covers  application  of  biological pesticides or chemical pesticides that leave a residue “on or near” waters of the U.S. Due to the permit differences from state to state, care must be taken to determine applicability. (T-0)   22  AFI32-1067  4 FEBRUARY 2015 Chapter 5 STORM WATER SYSTEMS LOCATED IN THE U.S. 5.1.  Storm  Water  System  Design.  The  BCE  designs  surface  drainage,  underground  drainage systems,  storm  water  management  facilities,  and  erosion  and  sediment  control  in  accordance with UFC 3-201-01, 1 Jun 2013 and  applicable requirements of the local regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the Installation; UFC 3-210-10; applicable LEED credits; and the criteria noted in this UFC; whichever is more stringent. (T-0) 5.2.  Storm  Water  Systems  O&M  and  Compliance.  The  BCE  operates  and  maintains  storm water facilities within applicable permit limits and according to  relevant  guidance in ETL 14-1 Construction and Operations and Maintenance Standards for Storm Water Systems. (T-0) 5.2.1.  Storm Water NPDES Permit. Storm water discharges to the waters of the US must be covered under either a General or an  Individual permit. When possible, installations should strive to operate under a General Storm Water permit. Industrial activities coverage under an NPDES permit is required for discharge of certain storm water categories associated with for example runway and aircraft deicing, landfill runoff, wash racks, etc. into waters of the U.S.  Installations  are  automatically  regulated  as  small  MS4s  (Municipal  Separate  Storm  Sewer System) if they are located within an Urbanized Area (UA), designated by the Bureau of the Census. Input and maintain storm water NPDES permits in the WET system.    (T-0) 5.2.2.  For CONUS installations, NPDES storm water discharge permit holders must develop and implement a SWPPP meeting Federal and state regulatory requirements (40 CFR 122.26 and  123.25).  For  overseas  installations,  the  FGS  or  OEBGD  also  require  the  development and  implementation  of  a  SWPPP.  Develop  and  implement  BMPs  to  eliminate/minimize pollutants.  Pursue  non-structural  BMPs  before  considering  structural  BMPs.  Ensure  BMPs are achievable and cost effective. (T-0) 5.2.3.  Municipal  Separate  Storm  Sewer  System  (MS4).  Installations  are  automatically regulated as small MS4s if they  are located within an Urbanized Area  (UA), designated by the  Bureau  of  the  Census.  Installations  should  consult  with  JA  to  determine  whether  the installation  is  required  to  comply  with  MS4  requirements.  Under  some  conditions,  the regulatory agency may designate installations not located in a UA for MS4 permit coverage. (T-0). 5.3.  Special Considerations 5.3.1.  Regulated Construction Activities. Construction activities disturbing one  (1) or more acres  in  aggregate  require  a  site  specific  SWPPP  and  the  timely  submission  of  a  Notice  of Intent  (NOI)  to  be  sent  to  the  appropriate  permitting  agency.  The  Installation  Management Flight (IMF) will review proposed construction activities to determine whether exemptions to submitting  an  NOI  are  available.  Attention  should  be  given  to  permitting  authority-specific requirements such as: parties submitting an NOI, signatory authority, preparing and keeping a  copy  of  the  SWPPP  on-site,  and  statutory  waiting  period  after  submission  of  the  NOI before  construction  can  begin.  For  overseas  installations,  refer  to  water  discharge  permits issued by recognized HN governments or authorities. (T-0) AFI32-1067  4 FEBRUARY 2015   23  5.3.1.1.  EISA  2007  Section  438  Compliance.    Federal  projects  that  construct  facilities with a footprint greater than 5,000 gross square feet, or projects that expand the footprint of  existing  facilities  by  more  than  5,000  gross  square  feet  shall  use  planning,  design, construction,  and  maintenance  strategies  for  the  property  to  maintain  or  restore,  to  the maximum extent technically feasible, the predevelopment hydrology of the property with regard  to  the  temperature,  rate,  volume,  and  duration  of  flow.    DoD  defines 'predevelopment  hydrology'  as  the  pre-project  hydrologic  conditions.    Storm  water systems shall be designed in accordance with Energy Independence Security Act (EISA) of 2007, Section 438. Although the performance requirements of EISA Section 438 apply only to the project footprint, the flexibility exists to utilize the entire federal property in implementing the storm water strategies for the project.  EISA 438 compliance should be addressed at the watershed level wherever possible for multiple applicable projects, rather than  separately  for  individual  single  construction  projects.    Any  construction  of  the permanent  retention  or  detention  ponds  is  strongly  discouraged.    If  retention/detention option is selected, written documentation for options considered and justification for the choice  should  be  included  in  the  design  analysis.  (See  DUSD  (I&E)  19  January  2010 policy memorandum, subject: DoD Implementation of Storm Water Requirements under Section 438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act). See also UFC 3-210-10, Low Impact  Development,  15  November  2010  for  DoD  implementing  guidance.  For  EISA 438  applicable  projects  (MILCON,  O&M,  NAF,  etc.)  CEN  updates  ACES-PM MAJCOM  unique  by  selecting  "EISA  438"  and  input  in  the  value  field  'Yes'  or  'No'  to indicate  whether  EISA  438  has  been  addressed  for  the  project.    Estimated  design  and construction costs for implementing EISA Section 438 shall be documented in the project cost estimate as a separate line item.  (T-0) 5.4.  Storm  Water  Fees.  Section  313(c)  of  the  CWA  was  amended  4  January  2011  through Public  Law  111-378  to  require  Federal  entities  to  pay  “reasonable  service  charges”  for  storm water  discharge  or  runoff  from  Federal  property  or  a  Federal  facility,  to  include  reasonable nondiscriminatory fees, charges, or assessments. (T-0) 5.4.1.  Installations that receive a storm water fee assessment shall coordinate with their local JA prior to any payments. The BCE seeks technical assistance from the IST as required and legal  support  from  AFLOA/JACE.  Payments  are  made  after  appropriate  legal  approvals. Input storm water fees paid pursuant to Public Law 111-378 in the WET system. (T-0) 5.5.  Wastewater Discharges from Aircraft Hangars.  Aircraft or vehicles shall not be washed or  rinsed  off  in  non-  corrosion  control  facilities,  corrosion  control  facilities  or  other  aircraft hangars unless this specific effluent has been addressed within an NPDES permit application and approved  by  NPDES  authority.    Wastewater  from  aircraft  hangars  containing  non-petroleum materials  or  products  will  not  be  discharged  to  pretreatment  gravity  OWSs.    If  wastewater characterization  is  hazardous  follow  hazardous  waste  disposal  requirements  per  AFI  32-7042, Waste Managemen.t (T-0) 5.6.  Accidental Releases of Fire Fighting Foam Solutions.  Unless permitted, do not discharge substances  that  contain  pentadecafluorooctanoic  acid,  perfluorooctanoic  acid,  perfluorocaprylic acid or perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) or perfluorooctanyl sulfonate, perfluoronoanoic acid (PFOS).  Release  of  firefighting  solutions  from  fire  systems  test  activation  and  fire  vehicle  chemical discharges will be captured, contained and disposed to meet applicable regulatory requirements.  Prior to  discharge to  the sanitary sewer; obtain approval  of the receiving  POTW or FOTW.   If   24  AFI32-1067  4 FEBRUARY 2015 metered  firefighting  foam  release  to  the  sanitary  sewer  is  not  approved,  then  containerize  and dispose  following  regulatory  standards.    Firefighting  foam  of  all  types  will  not  be  released  to storm water conveyance structures.  Overseas installations shall refer to water discharge permits issued  by  recognized  HN  governments  or  authorities.    See  AFI  32-7047  on  release  reporting requirements. (T-0) 5.7.  Other Wastewater and Storm water discharges:  Wastewater and storm water discharges associated  with  the  industrial  activities  (such  as  aircraft  birdbaths,  aircraft  deicing  operations, firefighting  training  operations,  etc…)  must  be  permitted  as  required  by  applicable  NPDES regulations. (T-0) AFI32-1067  4 FEBRUARY 2015   25  Chapter 6 LIQUID FUELS SYSTEMS 6.1.  Liquid Fuels  System Design.  Liquid fuel systems shall be designed IAW UFC 3-460-01, Design: Petroleum Fuel Facilities. (T-0) 6.2.  Liquid Fuels System O&M.

Special  Considerations.  Storage  tank  environmental  compliance  is  directed  by  AFI  32-7044, Storage Tank Environmental Compliance.   26  AFI32-1067  4 FEBRUARY 2015 Chapter 7 NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS LOCATED IN THE U.S. 7.1.  Natural  Gas  System  Design.  Natural  gas and LPG systems shall be designed IAW DOT PHMSA;  49  CFR  Part  192;  UFC  3-430-09,  Exterior  Mechanical  Utility  Distribution;  and Unified  Facilities  Guide  Specification  (UFGS)  33-51-15,  Natural  Gas/Liquid  Petroleum Distribution.  LPG  distribution  systems  shall  also  comply  with  National  Fire  Protection Association  (NFPA)  58,  Liquefied  Petroleum  Gas  Code,  and  natural  gas  distribution  systems shall comply with NFPA 54, National Fuel Gas Code. (T-0) 7.1.1.  All buried nonmetallic piping shall have an electrically conductive wire or tape buried within  12  inches  (305  millimeters)  above  the  pipe  as  a  means  for  locating  the  pipe.  High-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  pipe  specifically  manufactured  for  natural  gas  or  LPG  is  the only acceptable nonmetallic material for buried systems.  (T-1) 7.1.2.  LPG containers shall comply with NFPA 58. All containers shall have pressure relief devices.  Verify  that  LPG  containers  or  pressure  vessels  meet  the  American  Society  of Mechanical  Engineers  (ASME)  Boiler  and  Pressure  Vessel  Code  and  American  Petroleum Institute  (API)  minimum  requirements,  and  are  marked  to  show  compliance  with  these requirements.  Markings  show  designed  working  pressure  and  capacity.  Identify  container content according to Military Standard (MIL-STD)-101C, Color Code for Pipelines and for Compressed Gas Cylinders. Testing dates shall be shown on all LPG pressure vessels. (T-0) 7.1.3.  Design of LPG Propane-Air Mix Plants (PAMP).  Propane air mix is also known as synthetic  natural  gas.  Design  of  PAMP  shall  comply  with  NFPA  58  and  NFPA  59,  Utility LP-Gas Plant Code. (T-0) 7.1.3.1.  PAMPs  supplied  by  LPG  may  be  installed  when  economically  justified  or  as standby  for  systems  with  interruptible  natural  gas  supply  contracts.  Follow  the  original PAMP manufacturer’s instructions for the operation, maintenance, and inspection of this equipment. (T-1) CAUTION:  COMPRESSED  NATURAL  GAS  (CNG)  VEHICLE  FUELING  STATIONS MUST  NOT  BE  CONNECTED  TO  DISTRIBUTION  PIPING  THAT  COULD  AT  ANY TIME CONTAIN SUBSTANCES OTHER THAN NATURAL GAS. DOING SO COULD RESULT IN AN EXPLOSION. 7.1.3.2.  The  LPG  in  the  propane-air  mix  will  separate  from  the  air  and  liquefy  when compressed  by  the  CNG  system,  which  operates  at  a  much  higher  pressure  than  LPG systems.  This  may  damage  the  CNG  system  as  well  as  vehicles  or  equipment  designed strictly to operate on CNG. Additionally, this creates a potential explosive safety hazard. 7.2.  Gas Systems O&M.  Operate fuel gas systems and perform maintenance on the systems to comply  with  the  O&M  plan  developed  using  the  DOT  PHMSA.  (T-0)  Coordinate  with engineering to prepare and update system maps. Maintain cathodic protection on metallic piping systems. Use DOT PHMSA for shop reference. (T-0) 7.2.1.  Verify  that  system-critical  (key)  valves  and  other  critical  components  have  been maintained and operated as required in the O&M plan. Key valves must be checked at least once every year to ensure they are operable. (T-0) AFI32-1067  4 FEBRUARY 2015   27  7.2.2.  Gas leak surveys shall be accomplished annually, using leak-detection equipment, not to exceed 15 months between surveys. (T-0) Gas leak surveys shall be documented on forms similar to those under Appendix B to DOT PHMSA. (T-1) The frequency of inspections may be lengthened to two years for systems where underground piping is entirely constructed of HDPE pipe and when no leaks were discovered  in  the test immediately  prior to  the current test  cycle.  Gas  lines  in  highly  populated  areas  of  the  base  should  be  tested  annually regardless of pipe materials used. 7.2.3.  All gas on Air Force installations shall have a distinct odor to allow easy detection in the  atmosphere  at  all  gas  concentrations  from  one-fifth  of  the  lower  explosive  limit  and above.  (T-0)  When  such  gases  are  not  otherwise  available,  in-house  technicians  or  the  gas supplier will add the odorant. 7.3.  Gas Distribution System Map.  The BCE will prepare and maintain a general layout map of the base gas distribution system in the "G" series of the Base Comprehensive Plan. The BCE must distribute a complete map to the fire chief and all base activities involved in operating and maintaining  the  gas  distribution  system.  Copies  will  be  updated  annually;  show  dates  of revisions. (T-1) The map will be large enough to show (if applicable): 7.3.1.  Regulator locations. (T-1) 7.3.2.  Flow quantities and pressures. (T-1) 7.3.3.  All connected loads. (T-1) 7.3.4.

General  Permit—An  NPDES  permit  that  covers  several  facilities  that  have  the  same  type  of discharge  and  are  located  in  a  specific  geographic  area.  A  general  permit  applies  the  same  or similar conditions to all dischargers covered under the general permit. Using a general permit to cover  numerous  facilities  reduces  paperwork  for  permitting  authorities  and  permit  holders  and ensures consistency of permit conditions for similar facilities. Host Nation—A nation other than the United States that which receives the force or supplies of allied nations or North Atlantic Treaty Organization organizations, the former force or supplies to be located on, to operate in, or to transit through its territories. Individual  Permit—An NPDES permit specifically tailored to the types of discharges from an individual facility. Once a facility submits the appropriate application(s), the permitting authority develops  a  permit  for  that  particular  facility  based  on  the  information  contained  in  the  permit application  (e.g.,  type  of  activity,  nature  of  discharge,  receiving  water  quality).  Note:  For individual  permits,  WWTPs  can  be  found  in  the  EPA’s  Electric,  Gas,  and  Sanitary  Services category. Industrial Sewer—A conveyance system for collecting industrial wastewater.

Implementation.  Implementation  requires  all  installations  to  complete  the  following three actions required by paragraph 2.3.1: A2.1.1.  Systematically  locate  and  retain  existing  water  rights  documentation  and  data  as described in paragraph A2.4; A2.1.2.  Create an index listing each record located, where it is being retained, and the point of contact (POC) for each record (Table A2.1); A2.1.3.  Maintain this index in the installation CE real property office, with copies provided to  the  installation  legal  office.  This  index  will  serve  as  the  official  record  of  water  rights information for the base. (T-1) Table A2.1.  Index of Retained Water Rights Documentation and Data. Installation: Date: Document (including Location on Base Where Document is year) Retained POC, Organization, Contact Information File Title Table and Rule # e.g., Public Land Order No. XX-XX, 1939 Bldg 100, Room C John Public, A4C Real Estate, DSN:555-1234 Reports of Soil and Water Consolidated Reports T 32 - 38 R 04.00                                                                                                                         A2.2.  Points of Contact (POC). A2.2.1.  Form an informal or formal working group with members who will maintain water rights  records  (e.g., CEO, CEI, CES  engineering flight,  BE, historian, contracting, legal) to set out the course for this effort and assist with completing their portions of the index.   40  AFI32-1067  4 FEBRUARY 2015 A2.2.2.  The index is designed to be maintained as a spreadsheet but the installation can use whatever  suits  their  purpose  as  long  as  equivalent  information  is  maintained.  (Future  data management systems will allow inclusion of water rights information.) A2.3.  Process. A2.3.1.  Use  the  organization’s  file  plan  to  label  water  rights  records,  making  sure  it  is designated  for  permanent  retention  (Retire  as  permanent).  Follow  the  procedures  for establishing permanent records as explained in AFI 33-322, Records Management Program, AFMAN 33-363, and AFI 33-364. A2.3.2.  Include  a  statement  in  the  file  plan  and  on  the  file  equivalent  to,  “This  data  is indexed as Water Rights Records. All activities and inquiries related to the disposition or use of this data must be referred to the base legal office.” (T-1) A2.3.3.  The POC should maintain a working copy of the index for updating. A2.4.  Retention of Water Rights Documentation and Data. A2.4.1.  The  BCE  or  appointee  should  locate  and  retain  the  following  documentation  and data  for  each  Air  Force  installation.  While  intended  to  be  comprehensive,  collecting  the information below may not cover all necessary records. It is expected that data collection will not  just  be  limited  to  the  data  described  below  but  will  involve  the  collection  of  additional data. A2.4.2.  Whenever  possible,  the  original  documents  should  be  preserved.  If  original documents  are  not  available  or  are  in  poor  condition,  clean  copies  are  acceptable. Organizations  should  also  locate  and  retain  documentation  and  data  from  the  earliest available  date  or  timeframe,  from  the  time  the  Air  Force  installation  was  established  as  a military facility up to the present, or as far back as historical records are available. To help assist installations to locate these documents, the base CE organization(s) likely to have the information  are shown below, italicized in  brackets.  In some cases, the documentation may be located in organizations outside the CE organization, such as the base history office, legal office, and/or BE office. Questions from CE offices about specific documentation and data to locate and retain should be directed to the installation legal office. A2.4.2.1.
