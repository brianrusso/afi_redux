SUMMARY OF CHANGES This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.    2  HOI33-18  30 September 2014 1. Overview/Background:          1.1.  The  FOIA  is  an  access  statute  that  opens  the  business  of  government  to  the  general      public.    The  FOIA  allows  anyone,  regardless  of  citizenship,  to  request  copies  of  existing     government records without giving a reason for their request.      1.2. Generally, all government information is subject to the FOIA.  This information includes     all paper and electronic materials (not just records maintained in the organization's official     filing system), including information maintained in Privacy Act (PA) systems of records.  It     also  includes  e-mail,  word  processing  files,  agency  working  files,  etc.    The  public  may     inspect or obtain copies of all public filings (public records) maintained by an agency through     public reference facilities or public web pages.  However, requests for access to non-public     agency records must be submitted in writing under the provisions of the FOIA.      1.3. The FOIA requires all federal agency records to be released to the public upon written     request.    EXCEPTIONS:  There  are  nine  specific  exemptions  and  two  specific  law     enforcement record exclusions that may require and/or allow an agency to deny access by the     requester.  For more information on these exemptions and exclusions, refer to AFMAN 33     302, Chapter 3.       1.4. The FOIA, as implemented in AFMAN 33-302, requires the government to respond to     written  requests  (including  facsimile  or  e-mail)  for  information  within  20  workdays  after     receipt of the request.  Therefore, when an office receives a written FOIA request for agency     records  from  anyone  outside  the  organization  the  request  must  be  forwarded  to  the  HAF     FOIA  Requester  Service  Center  (SAF/AAII  (FOIA))  for  log  in  and  staffing.    The  request     must be forwarded by either email to usaf.pentagon.saf-aa.mbx.haf-foia-workflow@mail.mil     or by fax to (703) 703-693-5728.  In addition to emailing or faxing, the original (hardcopy)     request  letter  must  be  forwarded  to  SAF/AAII  (FOIA),  1000  Air  Force  Pentagon,     Washington, DC 20330-1000.      1.5. Once a request has been received by a designated FOIA monitor or OPR, all responsive     information must be reviewed for release by the office receiving the request; no information     may be created or destroyed.  If the organization's Initial Denial Authority (IDA) determines     that some or all of the responsive documents should not be released to the public, the letter to     SAF/AAII  (FOIA)  must  cite  the  rationale  and  the  applicable  FOIA  exemption(s)  or     exclusion(s).      1.6. Accurate recordkeeping is a must! Without authorization from SAF/AAII (FOIA) or as     provided in this HOI, a copy of all records, legal reviews, and any other applicable     correspondence related to the request must be forwarded to SAF/AAII (FOIA) for filing and     final processing.  2. Air Force Program Guidance (see AFMAN 33-302).       2.1. All HAF organizations must implement both the FOIA and Privacy Act (PA) to comply     with this HOI and protect the rights of the U.S. Government and persons directly affected by     Air Force actions.         3              3.1.2.7. Send extension notices.           3.1.2.1. Control and process FOIA requests.  3.1.2. Ensure administrative correctness of all FOIA actions processed. 3.1.1. Manage the HAF FOIA program exercising the same procedural and staff             3.1.1.2. Help Two-Letter FOIA Monitors and OPRs with requests as required.           3.1.1.1. Where SAF/AAII (FOIA) can support FOIA management requirements HOI33-18  30 September 2014        2.2. This HOI applies to contractors performing FOIA/PA management support and those      contractors performing duties/services/functions in place of, or in support of, U.S.      Government employees.  Performance work statements must include FOIA/PA requirements.  3. HAF Responsibilities       3.1. HAF FOIA Requester Service Center (SAF/AAII (FOIA)) shall:                  responsibilities as specified in AFMAN 33-302.                                for DRUs, FOAs, or other tenant organizations, that support will be delineated in                        a support agreement.                                                   requesters, as required.                                                and tracking system, to the Two-Letter FOIA Monitor and a notification to the                        Two-Letter workflow via Task Management Tool (TMT).                                                      in the requested documents, consultation with that organization is required.                                                 contains another federal agency‘s or DOD component‘s equities can be                                    found in AFMAN 33-302, Chapter 5.1.5.                                                        the time limits may be extended by written notice to the requester setting           3.1.2.6.

With respect to a request for which a written notice under                                    forth the unusual circumstances for such extension and the date on which a                                    determination is expected to be dispatched.  No such notice shall specify a                                    date that would result in an extension for more than ten workdays, except                                    as provided in paragraph 3.1.2.6.2.                                                paragraph                                                           3.1.2.7.3. extends the time limits, SAF/AAII (FOIA) shall notify the                                    requester the request cannot be processed within the time limit specified,                                    and shall provide the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of the                                    request, so that it may be processed within that time limit, or an                                    opportunity to arrange an alternative time frame for processing the request                                    or a modified request.  Refusal by the requester to modify the request                                    reasonably or arrange such an alternative time frame shall be considered as                                    a factor in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist as                                    discussed in 5 U.S.C. § 552(6)(C).                       3.1.2.8.

Some FOIA requests, especially at the HAF level, are broad and                                              complex, and may involve multiple AF, DOD and other federal agencies.                                    In such cases, the FOIA works best when all involved parties (SAF/AAII                                    (FOIA), FOIA Monitors, OPRs, and requesters) work together.

See Chapter 5, paragraph 2.6                       (C5.2.6.) for more details concerning extension requests.  Failure to meet extension                       suspense will result in notification of the staff   principal (Secretariat Office, Air                       Staff Deputy Chief of Staff or equivalent).               3.3.9.

Send FOIA responses to usaf.pentagon.saf-aa.mbx.haf-foia-workflow@mail.mil.         3.4. Offices of Primary Responsibility shall:               3.4.1. Review the FOIA request and provide SAF/AAII (FOIA) an estimate of fees, if              cost will exceed $15 or the amount the requester has agreed to pay, whichever is higher.              Also, notify the FOIA Office if additional information is needed to conduct a reasonable              search for records.  Provide SAF/AAII (FOIA) a fee estimate and request for additional              information not later than 5 duty days from receipt. The FOIA Office will notify your              office to resume processing the request upon receipt of the requester’s commitment to              pay the fees or clarification.               3.4.2. Conduct a thorough review for requested records.               3.4.3. Complete the “no records” statement if the office is the OPR for the record and no              responsive record found.  Also, include the records management disposition governing              the requested documents.               3.4.4.

These requests are submitted to the agency            whose equity, or "ownership", is invested in the document. Once an MDR request has            been submitted to an agency for the review of a particular document, the agency must            respond within one year from date of receipt of the request, either with an approval, a            denial, or the inability to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of the requested            document.
