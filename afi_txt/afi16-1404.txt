There are three types of classification: Original, Tentative, and Derivative. DoDM 5200.01, Volume 1, Enclosure 4 is the foundational guidance for Original, Tentative, and Derivative Classification. 3.2.  Original Classification.  The SECAF delegates Top Secret original classification authority (OCA) to Air Force officials. SAF/AA may delegate Secret and Confidential OCA. 3.2.1.  No other Air Force OCA has delegation or designation authority. 3.2.2.  SAF/AAZ maintains the Air Force list of all OCA delegations by position and level of authority. 3.2.3.  Prior to submitting a request for OCA the MAJCOM/DRU SPE or SAF/HAF Director considers: 3.2.3.1.  Can  the  need  be  met  through  issuance  of  security  classification  guides  by  an existing OCA in the chain of command? 3.2.3.2.  Is  referral  of  the  decision  impractical  for  reasons  such  as  geographical separation? 3.2.3.3.  Is there sufficient expertise and information available to the prospective OCA to permit effective classification decision-making? 3.2.4.  Submit  request  for  OCA  through  established  Information  Protection  channels  to SAF/AAZ. (T-1) Include in the request: 3.2.4.1.  Position title. (T-1) 3.2.4.2.

(T-0) 3.2.4.3.2.  The position will exercise their authority at least twice a year. (T-0) 3.2.5.  Before exercising OCA duties and annually thereafter the OCA: 3.2.5.1.  Receive training from the Wing Information Protection Office. (T-1) 3.2.5.2.  Certify  in  writing  that  they  have  received  training  in  the  areas  specified  in DoDM 5200.01, Volume 1, Enclosure 4. 3.2.6.  The  Wing  Information  Protection  Office  will  maintain  OCA  delegation  letters  and training  certifications  of  assigned  OCAs  and  will  submit  the  delegation  letters  and  training certifications when requested through Information Protection channels to SAF/AAZ. (T-1) 3.2.7.  OCAs  issue  security  classification  and  declassification  guidance,  use  approved methods  for  protecting  classified  and  CUI,  review  security  incidents  for  compromise,  and conduct damage assessments when information is considered compromised. AFI16-1404  29 MAY 2015   19  3.2.7.1.  Issue classification and declassification guidance as soon as practical in the life cycle  of  the  system,  plan,  program,  or  project  to  ensure  only  information  requiring protected  is  identified.  OCAs  may  use  memoranda  and  other  communication  media  to issue  classification  guidance,  but  the  preferred  method  is  a  security  classification  guide (SCG).  Coordinate  all  classification  guidance  through  the  Wing  Information  Protection Office. This does not apply to SAP or SCI guides. Wing Information Protection Offices review the guides for proper formatting and ensure all classification marking are present. Regardless  of  the  medium  used,  OCAs  review  their  guidance  once  every  5  years  IAW DoDM 5200.01, Volume 1, Enclosure 6. When making declassification decisions use: 3.2.7.1.1.  A date less than 10 years. If not, can it be declassified at the 10 year mark? Mark the Declassify On line with the date using YYYYMMDD format. 3.2.7.1.2.  A  date  between  10  years,  but  less  than  25  years.  If  not,  can  it  be declassified  at  25  years?  Mark  the  Declassify  On  line  with  the  date  using YYYYMMDD format. 3.2.7.1.3.  An  event  (e.g.,  upon  completion  of  tests)  used  in  conjunction  with  either 3.2.7.4.1. or 3.2.7.4.2. Mark the Declassify On line as: YYYYMMDD, Completion of Test, Whichever is later.” 3.2.7.1.4.  An exemption approved by the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel  (ISCAP).  The  Air  Force  Declassification  Office  (AFDO)  publishes  and maintains  the  Air  Force  Declassification  Guide  for  Historical  Records  approved exemption categories. If an exemption is not listed in this guide then a formal request to the ISCAP must be submitted through the AFDO following the guidance in DoDM 5200.01, Volume 1, Enclosure 5. 3.2.7.2.  Use DoDM 5200.45, Instructions for Developing Security Classification Guides for  completing  the  guide.  Attachment  2,  Security  Classification  and  Declassification Guide  Formatting,  is  the  standard  format  for  the  Air  Force.  Ensure  the  guides  are processed in accordance with DoDM 5200.01, Volume 1, Enclosure 6, and if distributing the guide ensure a copy is sent to SAF/AAI. See Attachment 3 for instructions on how to complete the DD Form 2024, DoD Security Classification Guide Data Elements. 3.2.7.3.  Do  not  publish  declassification  guidance  in  Air  Force  publications.  If  an  Air Force publication has already been issued to disseminate original classification guidance ensure: 3.2.7.3.1.  It contains declassification instructions. 3.2.7.3.2.  Has  OCA  classification  authority  block  (see  DoDM  5200.01,  Volume  2, Figure 3. Example of Originally Classified Document) and is signed by the OCA or a supervisor within the OCAs chain of command with OCA at the appropriate level of classification. 3.2.7.4.  Alternative compensatory control measures (ACCM) are not  authorized for use in the Air Force. 3.2.7.5.  When notified of a compromise of  classified information take actions  to  verify the  classification  and  duration  of  classification  initially  assigned  to  the  information  in accordance with DoDM 5200.01, Volume 3, Enclosure 6.   20  AFI16-1404  29 MAY 2015 3.2.7.6.  Conduct  damage  assessments  in  accordance  with  DoDM  5200.01,  Volume  3, Enclosure  6.  Damage  assessments  are  undertaken  to  determine  the  effect  of  a compromise following a security incident that could lead to compromise when it cannot be determined if a compromised occurred. 3.2.8.  OCAs provide data to support the Senior Agency Official (SAF/AA) annual reporting requirements to  the  Information Security Oversight  Office identified in  Chapters 10 and 11 of this AFI. 3.3.  Tentative  Classification.  A  process  used  by  individuals  who  submit  information  to  an OCA for making  classification decisions. Tentative classification answers the statements in  the original classification process. Follow the guidance in the DoDM 5200.01, Volume 1, Enclosure 4, for instructions on tentative classification. 3.4.  Derivative  Classification.  All  Air  Force  personnel  (military,  civilian,  and  on-site contractors)  with  access  to  classified  information  systems  are  considered  derivative  classifiers and  any  other  person  designated  by  the  commander  or  director.  Derivative  classifiers  are responsible  for  all  markings  associated  with  the  documents  they  create  and  may  be  subject  to sanctions identified in DoDM 5200.01, Volume 1, Enclosure 3. (T-1) Derivative classifiers must: 3.4.1.  Receive initial training and refresher training every 2 years. (T-0) Refer to Chapter 6 of  this  AFI  for  requirements.  Maintain  copies  of  training  records  and  provide  them  to  the security manager, information protection office, or inspector general upon request. (T-1) 3.4.2.  Follow the instructions in the security classification guide if there is a conflict between a SCG and other source document. (T-0) 3.4.3.  Consult  with  an  OCA,  originator  of  the  source  document,  or  notify  the  Security Manager/Wing Information Protection Office when required markings are missing or omitted from a source document. (T-0) 3.5.  Declassification  and  Changes  in  Classification.  Declassification  does  not  authorize release  of  information  to  the  public.  Refer  DoDM  5200.01,  Volume  1,  Enclosure  5,  prior  to releasing any previously classified document or any of its pages to the public. 3.5.1.  Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential information may be declassified or downgraded by an OCA with classification, program, or functional responsibility; supervisory officials of the OCA if appointed as an OCA, or by the AFDO. 3.5.2.

Classified Information.  The proper marking of a classified document, to include e-mail, is the  specific  responsibility  of  the  author  (original  or  derivative  classifier).  Classified  markings alert the holder to the presence of classified information, reasons for classification, identity of the person that classified the document in the event of a classification challenge or questions arise, and provide guidance on downgrading and declassification. The marking standards for classified information are published in DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2 and this AFI. The marking standard for SAP Material is in accordance with DoDM 5205.07, Volume 4, Special Access Program (SAP) Security  Manual:  Marking.  Refer  all  marking  questions  to  the  servicing  Wing  Information Protection  Office.  All  original  and  derivative  classified  documents  will  contain  the  overall classification  in  the  banner  lines,  portion  markings,  and  a  classification  authority  block,  unless specifically prohibited by rule. (T-0) 4.1.1.  Do  not  re-mark  documents  marked  in  accordance  with  the  Information  Security Oversight Office Marking guide and any previous Executive Order guidance. 4.1.2.  Process  waivers involving marking of  collateral  classified information in  accordance with  DoDM  5200.01,  Volume  2,  Enclosure  1,  through  Information  Protection  channels  to SAF/AAZ.

Classified  Message  Incidents  (CMI)— A higher classification level of data is transferred to a lower classification level system/device via messaging systems, e.g., e-mail, instant messaging, etc. Data  Spillage—  Occurs  whenever  classified  information  or  CUI  is  transferred  onto  an information  system  not  authorized  for  the  appropriate  security  level  or  not  having  the  required CUI  protection  or  access  controls.  For  example,  when  a  user  takes  a  file  such  as  a  word document and copies it to removable media (e.g., DVD or CD) from SIPRNET and then the user takes  that  media  and  loads  the  data  onto  a  NIPRNET  computer.  A  classified  data  spillage  is  a security violation. A data spillage is not necessarily a CMI. Derivative  Classification—  Incorporating,  paraphrasing,  restating,  or  generating  in  new  form information that is already classified, and marking the newly developed material consistent with the  classification  markings  that  apply  to  the  source  information.  Includes  the  classification  of information  based  on  classification  guidance.  The  duplication  or  reproduction  of  existing classified information is not derivative classification. Inadvertent Spillage or Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified Information on Information Systems— An incident where a person did not know, and had no reasonable basis to know, that the  security  violation  or  unauthorized  disclosure  was  occurring  while  using  an  information system (e.g., a person reasonably relied on improper markings). Information  Protection—  Information  Protection  is  a  subset  of  the  Air  Force  Security Enterprise  and  consists  of  the  core  security  disciplines  (Personnel,  Industrial,  and  Information Security)  used  to  determine  military,  civilian,  and  contractor  personnel’s  eligibility  to  access classified  information,  ensure  the  protection  of  classified  information  released  or  disclosed  to industry in connection with classified contracts, and protect classified information and CUI that, if subject to unauthorized disclosure, could reasonably be expected to cause damage to  national security. Need—To-Know  -  A  determination  that  a  prospective  recipient  requires  access  to  specific classified  information  in  order  to  perform  or  assist  in  a  lawful  and  authorized  governmental function.  For contractors their need-to-know is their requirements of the contract and DD Form 254. Negligent  Discharge  of  Classified  Information—  term  based  on  the  familiar  firearms  term “Negligent  Discharge”  to  connote  the  seriousness  of  a  spillage  or  unauthorized  disclosure  of classified information while using an information system.   64  AFI16-1404  29 MAY 2015 Negligent  Spillage  or  Unauthorized  Disclosure  of  Classified  Information  on  Information Systems— An incident where a person acted unreasonably in causing a spillage or unauthorized disclosure  while  using  an  information  system  (e.g.,  a  careless  lack  of  attention  to  detail,  or reckless disregard for proper procedures). Nuclear  Weapon  Data  (NWD)—  RD  and  FRD  concerning  the  design,  manufacture,  or utilization (including theory, development, storage, characteristics, performance, and effects) of nuclear  weapons  or  nuclear  weapon  components,  including  information  incorporated  in  or related to nuclear explosive devices. Original Classification— Initial determination information requires, in the interests of national security, protection against unauthorized disclosure. Senior  Agency  Official—  The  SECAF  designated  position  for  directing,  administering,  and overseeing  the  Air  Force  Information  Security  Program  in  accordance  with  DoDM  5200.01, Volume 1, DoD Information Security Program: Overview, Classification, and Declassification, Enclosure  2,  SAF/AA  is  the  Air  Force  Senior  Agency  Official.  There  are  no  other  Senior Agency Officials within the Air Force. Security-in-Depth—  Determinations  by  the  senior  agency  official  that  a  facility’s  security program consists of layered and complimentary security controls sufficient to deter, detect, and document  unauthorized  entry  and  movement  within  the  facility.  Air  Force  facilities  located  on installations with a perimeter fence or other type of legal boundary, perimeter access controls for employees  and  visitors,  law  enforcement  and  security  patrols,  and  have  locking  doors  and  or another  type  of  access  controls  have  security-in-depth.  All  other  determinations  are  made  the SPE or Wing Commander for storage of Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential information. Sigma  14— The category  of sensitive information (including bypass  scenarios) concerning the vulnerability of nuclear weapons to a deliberate unauthorized nuclear detonation. Sigma 15— The category of sensitive information concerning the design and function of nuclear weapons  use  control  systems,  features,  and  components.  This  includes  use  control  for  passive and active systems. It may include weapon design features not specifically part of a use control system. Not all nuclear weapons use control design information is Sigma 15. Sigma  18—  Nuclear  weapons  data  that  includes  information  that  would  allow  or  significantly facilitate a proliferate nation or entity to fabricate a credible nuclear weapon or nuclear explosive based on a proven, certified, or endorsed US nuclear weapon or device.  This information would enable  the  establishment  or  improvement  of  nuclear  capability  without  nuclear  testing  or  with minimal research and development. Sigma 20— The category of nuclear weapons data that pertains to sensitive improvised nuclear device information. Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI)— relates to physical protection of DoD special  nuclear  material  (SNM),  SNM  equipment,  and  SNM  facilities,  including  unclassified information  on  the  physical  protection  of  nuclear  weapons  containing  SNM  in  the  custody  of DoD. Willful  Spillage  or  Unauthorized  Disclosure  of  Classified  Information  on  Information Systems—    An  incident  where  a  person  purposefully  disregards  DoD  or  Air  Force  Security  or AFI16-1404  29 MAY 2015   65  information safeguarding policies or requirements (e.g., intentionally bypassing a known security control).    66  AFI16-1404  29 MAY 2015 AIR FORCE SECURITY CLASSIFICATION GUIDE TEMPLATE Attachment 2 A2.1.  This  template  is  the  Air  Force  standard  for  security  classification  guides  (SCG).  It  can also be used for development of security declassification guides.

SCG Template Section 1  [CLASSIFICATION] – See Figure A2.1 for proper marking requirements  [TITLE] SECURITY CLASSIFICATION AND DECLASSIFICATION GUIDE  SECTION 1 – GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS  1. Purpose. To provide instructions and guidance on the classification of information involved in (name of  system, plan, program,  project,  or mission) using an unclassified identification of the effort. (If it is necessary to classify the guide, modify this paragraph as necessary to acknowledge the classified content.)  2.  Authority.  This  guide  is  issued  under  authority  of  Executive  Order  13526,  DoDM  5200.01, and AFI 16-1404.  Classification of information involved in (identify the effort) is governed by, and is in accordance with, (cite any applicable classification guidance or guides under which this guide is issued). This guide constitutes authority and may be cited as the basis for classification, regarding,  or  declassification  of  information  and  material  involved  in  (identify  the  effort). Changes  in  classification  required  by  application  of  this  guide  shall  be  made  immediately. Information  identified  in  this  guide  for  protection  as  classified  information  is  classified  by (complete title or position of classifying authority).  3. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR): This guide is issued by, and all inquiries concerning content and interpretation, as well as any recommendations for changes, should be addressed to:    (Include name, office symbol, mailing address, organizational NIPRNET email address, and  DSN  and  commercial  phone  numbers.  Also  specify  secure  data  and  voice  contact information to receive classified or sensitive communications.)  4. Classification Challenges. If at any time, any of the security classification guidance contained herein is challenged, the items of information involved shall continue to be protected at the level prescribed by this guide until such time as a final decision is made on the challenge by the OCA.  Classification challenges should be addressed to the OPR.  5.  Reproduction,  Extraction,  and  Dissemination.  Authorized  recipients  of  this  guide  may reproduce,  extract,  and  disseminate  the  contents  of  this  guide,  as  necessary,  for  application  by specified groups involved in [identification of the effort], including industrial activities.  Copies of separate  guides issued to  operating activities  in  application of this guide shall be sent  to  the OPR. (If it is necessary to classify the guide, modify this paragraph as necessary to express any required limitations.)  6. Public Release. The fact that this guide shows certain details of information to be unclassified, including controlled unclassified information, does not allow automatic public   [CLASSIFICATION] – See Figure A2.1 for proper marking requirements   72  AFI16-1404  29 MAY 2015  [CLASSIFICATION]  –  See  Figure  A2.1  for  proper  marking  requirements  release  of  this information. DoD information requested by the media or members of the public or proposed for release  to  the  public  by  DoD  civilians,  military  personnel,  or  contractors  shall  be  processed  in accordance  with  DoD  Manual  5200.01,  DoD  Information  Security  Program,  DoD  Directive 5230.09, Clearance of DoD Information for Public Release,  DoD Instruction 5230.29, Security Policy Review of DoD Information for Public Release, AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act  Program,  and  AFI  35-102,  Security  and  Policy  Review  Process,  as  applicable.  Proposed public  disclosures  of  unclassified  information  regarding  (identification  of  effort)  shall  be processed  through  (identify  office  to  which  requests  for  public  disclosure  are  to  be  sent  and provide  contact  information  (information,  where  the  specific  office  cannot  be  identified,  state that requests should be processed through “appropriate channels for approval”).  7. Foreign Disclosure. Any disclosure to foreign officials of information classified by this guide shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in  applicable issuances implementing DoD foreign  disclosure  policy,  e.g.,  DoD  Directive  5230.11,  Disclosure  of  Classified  Military Information  to  Foreign  Governments  and  International  Organizations,  and  AFI  16-201,  Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program]. If a country with which the DoD has entered into a reciprocal procurement memorandum of understanding or offset arrangement, expresses  an  interest  in  this  effort,  a  foreign  disclosure  review  should  be  conducted  prior  to issuance of a solicitation. (If it is known that foreign participation cannot be permitted because of the sensitivity of the effort, this fact should be stated. Add other guidance as appropriate.)  8.  Release  of  Program  Data  on  the  Internet.  Extreme  care  must  be  taken  when  considering information  for  release  onto  publicly  accessible  or  unprotected  Internet  sites.  In  addition  to satisfying all of the aforementioned approval provisions, owners and/or releasers of information proposed  for  such  release  must  ensure  that  it  is  not  susceptible  to  compilation  with  other information  to  render  sensitive  or  even  classified  data  in  the  aggregate.  Internet  technology search  and  data  mining  capabilities  must  be  assessed  from  a  risk-management  perspective. Information intended for publication on publicly accessible or unprotected Internet sites must be cleared  for  public  release  prior  to  publication  according  to  AFI  35-102,  Security  and  Policy Review Process. Also refer to AFI 35-107, Public Web Communications.  If there are any doubts, do not release the information.  9.  Definitions.  (Include  in  this  paragraph  the  definitions  of  any  items  for  which  there  may  be various meanings to ensure common understanding of the details of information that are covered by the guide.)    [CLASSIFICATION] – See Figure A2.1 for proper marking requirements   AFI16-1404  29 MAY 2015   73   Figure A2.4.  SCG Template Section 2  [CLASSIFICATION] – See Figure A2.1 for proper marking requirements in this  paragraph  any  necessary  statements  explaining  SECTION 2 – OVERALL EFFORT   the 1.  Identification.  (Include classifications,  if  any,  to  be  assigned  to  various  statements  identifying  the  effort.  These statements should be consistent with other program documentation.)   2.  Goal,  Mission,  Purpose.  (Include  in  this  paragraph  any  necessary  statements  identifying information  concerning  the  purpose  of  the  effort  that  can  be  released  as  unclassified  and  that which must be classified. Take care to ensure that unclassified statements do not reveal classified information.)   3. End Item. (Include in this paragraph statements of the classification to be assigned to the end products  of  the  effort,  whether  paperwork  or  hardware.    In  this  connection  it  is  important  to distinguish between classification required to protect the fact of the existence of a completed end item,  and  classification  required  because  of  what  the  end  item  contains  or  reveals.    In  some instances  classified  information  pertaining  to  performance,  manufacture,  or  composition  of incorporated parts or materials is not ascertainable from mere use of or access to the end item. In others,  the  classifiable  information  is  that  which  concerns  total  performance,  capabilities, vulnerabilities, or weaknesses of the end item itself, rather than any of the parts or materials.)

SCG Template Section 3  [CLASSIFICATION] – See Figure A2.1 for proper marking requirements  SECTION 3 – (SAMPLE) PERFORMANCE AND CAPABILITIES   (This  section  includes  characteristics  of  performance  and  capability  of  an  end  item,  or  an  end item’s  components,  parts,  or  materials,  the  performance  or  capabilities  of  which  require classification.  In  this  section  also  provide,  in  sequentially  numbered  items,  statements  that express details of performance and capabilities planned and actual. Include both those elements that warrant classification and those that are unclassified. These statements normally would not set  forth  the  numeric  values  that  indicate  degree  of  performance  or  capability,  planned  or attained,  but  merely  should  identify  the  specific  elements  of  performance  or  capability  that  are covered.  When  it  is  necessary  to  state  certain  limiting  figures  above  or  below  which classification is required, the statement itself may warrant classification. For clarity, continuity, or ease of reference it may be desirable to include performance classification data in the sections dealing with the end item or the components or parts to which the performance data apply. Use a “Remarks” column for explanations, limitations, special conditions, associations, etc.)                       [CLASSIFICATION] – See Figure A2.1 for proper marking requirements   AFI16-1404  29 MAY 2015   75   Figure A2.6.

Inclusion  in  this  section  is  required because  the  items  require  classification  because  they  contribute  to  the  national  security advantage  resulting  from  this  effort,  or  because  they  frequently  require  classification  but  are unclassified  in  (identification  of  this  effort).  Classification  of  specifications  pertaining  to performance and capability are covered in section 3 of the guide. (Actual figures do not need to be  given,  merely  statements  identifying  clearly  the  specific  items  of  information  involved.  If figures  are  necessary  to  establish  classification  levels,  it  may  be  necessary  to  classify  the statements themselves. When necessary for clarity, continuity or ease of reference, specification classification  data  may  be  included  in  sections  on  the  end  product  or  components  or  parts  to which the data apply.

When  issued  from  a  headquarters  level,  the  classification  is  most likely to be applied to the hardware end item itself, rather than its individual components. b. The channels or hands through which the guidance will travel to the ultimate user. The closer the issuer is to the user, the more detailed the guidance may become. When the issuer is removed from the  user,  intermediate  levels  of  guidance  may  be  required  to  expand  or  elaborate  on  the  guidance provided  by  the  basic  classification  guide  and  to  cover  more  details  concerning  materials,  parts, components, assemblies, and subassemblies,  and  the classification, if any, to  be assigned.  Any such expansion or elaboration should be fully coordinated with the headquarters issuing the basic guide. c.  The  ease  of  determining  when  classified  information  could  be  revealed  by  a  particular  hardware item.  Obscure  connections  and  associations  that could  reveal  classified  information  may  require  the issuer of the guide to state classification for certain hardware items. In such cases it probably would be advisable to explain why classification is necessary.  d. Whether there are factors that require consideration and action at a headquarters level.  National or DoD policy, intelligence data, broad operational requirements, extraneous factors, or other matters not ordinarily  available  below  headquarters,  or  that  require  high  level  consideration  may  result  in decisions to classify certain hardware items.)
