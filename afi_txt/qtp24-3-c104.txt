Knowledge Overview (Lecture).  5.1.1.  Past and present, recovery vehicles have been called wrecker, tow truck, tow car, tow ambulance,  etc.    For  this  training  we  will  use  the  term  “wrecker”  during  our  discussion.  Because of the varying Air Force (AF) missions and types of vehicles used, the AF has a variety of different wreckers to accomplish its vehicle recovery mission.  5.1.2.  Like any other vehicle, training and licensing is a requirement to ensure the trainee can operate a wrecker safely and proficiently.  Not only will he/she be challenged by recovering vehicles, but they will also be faced with dealing with accidents that involve vehicle overturns and cargo shifts and spills out on the roadways.  5.1.3.  While  the  end  objective  is  retrieving  a  vehicle,  each  type  wrecker  has  its  own characteristics for safely retrieving a vehicle.  The following material will only provide a basic knowledge for wrecker operations, so it is imperative to review the operator’s manual for the wrecker being operated.  5.2. Overview of Training and Requirements.  5.2.1.  Training objectives:   5.2.1.1.  Given lectures, demonstrations, hands-on driving session, trainees will be able to perform  operator’s  inspection  and  complete  the  performance  test  with  zero  instructor assists.  5.2.1.2.  Train and qualify each trainee in safe operation and preventive maintenance of the various wreckers.  5.2.1.3.  This training will ensure the trainee becomes a qualified wrecker operator—an operator who has the knowledge and skills to operate a wrecker in a safe and professional manner. 5.2.2.  Desired learning outcomes:  5.2.2.1.  Understand  the  safety  precautions  to  be  followed  before-,  during-,  and  after-operation of the wrecker.  5.2.2.2.  Understand the purpose of the wrecker and its role in the mission.  5.2.2.2.1.   Role in the mission (Unit/Base/Community (during natural disasters)/Air Force).  5.2.2.2.2.   Know the proper operator maintenance procedures of the wrecker, in IAW applicable technical orders and use of AF Form 1800.  5.2.2.2.3.   Be able to safely and proficiently operate the wrecker.  5.2.2.2.4.   Why is it important to safely and proficiently operate the wrecker?  5.2.2.2.4.1.  Meet mission requirements.  5.2.2.2.4.2.  Demonstrates a qualified trained professional operator   5.2.3.  Wrecker Design.  A wrecker is a truck that has a permanently affixed hoist, towing apparatus, or self-loading flatbed, or any combination of these items, used to transport vehicle.  There are three basic types of wreckers.  See Figure 5.1., Figure 5.2., and Figure 5.3.  5.2.3.1.  Basic wrecker types: 5.2.3.1.1.   Rollback:  Rollback wreckers are ideal for most modern vehicles.  They prevent damage to the underside of the vehicle and they are also ideal for vehicles that are totaled.  5.2.3.1.2.   Hook:  Special purpose and heavy vehicles (tractor-trailers) usually require a hook wrecker.  5.2.3.1.3.   Wheel-lift:  Medium duty wreckers have wheel-lifts for use with cars and small trucks.  5.2.3.1.4.   Some wrecker designs allow the vehicle to serve a dual purpose of retrieving vehicles either by the wheel-lift or hook method.  5.2.3.1.5.   Some flatbed wreckers are designed to tow an additional vehicle with an attached wheel-lift or hook attachment.  Figure 5.1.  Flatbed Wrecker.    Figure 5.2.  Wheel-Lift Wrecker.   Figure 5.3.  Hook Wrecker.     5.2.3.2.  Wrecker  information  found  in  the  Manufacturer’s  Operator’s  Manual,  the appropriate TO or on data plate.  Information concerning the safe load capacity of a wrecker can be found on its data plate.  The wrecker’s data plate specifications are generally boom ratings,  winch  ratings,  specification  of  the  wire  rope,  and  under  lift  ratings  (rated loads/capabilities).  5.2.3.2.1.   Boom rating.  5.2.3.2.2.   Winch rating.   5.2.3.2.3.   Specification of wire rope. 5.2.3.2.4.   Under lift rating (rated loads/capabilities).  5.2.3.3.  Components of the wrecker:  5.2.3.3.1.   Truck  (engine/chassis  and  cab).    The  towing  portion  of  a  wrecker  is manufactured by a company different than the manufacturer of the truck.  Common components found on the truck portion of the wrecker are air brakes and power take-off (PTO).            5.2.3.3.1.1.  Air brakes (will be covered in detail later). See Section 8. 5.2.3.3.1.2.  Power take-Off (PTO):  The PTO control is located in the cab of the truck, either on the dashboard or on the floor.  5.2.3.3.1.2.1.  When engaged, it supplies power to operate a hydraulic pump that powers the hoist cables or hydraulics used to raise and lower the tow bar assembly (hook) or to raise and extend the bed on flatbed wreckers.  5.2.3.3.1.2.2.  The PTO operates on the power from the engine; during recovery operations engine speed can be controlled by a throttle control lever located in the cab of the vehicle and/or on the bed of the wrecker. 5.2.3.3.1.2.3.  Supplies power to wrecker components. 5.2.3.3.1.2.4.  Powered by truck engine. 5.2.3.3.1.2.5.  Throttle control lever. 5.2.3.3.2.   Towing assembly. 5.2.3.3.2.1.  Common components. 5.2.3.3.2.1.1.  Hoist  control  levers.    The  hoist-control  levers  are  the  control point for raising, lowering, and/or extending the tow bar, wheel-lift, flatbed and cable hoists.  Figure 5.4. shows an example of hoist control levels on a wrecker. 5.2.3.3.2.1.2.  Throttle control lever.  It controls the engine idle speed from the rear of the wrecker.  Remember, the heavier the vehicle, the faster the wrecker idle speed. Note:  CAUTION – Ensure the PTO is disengaged while traveling. Note:  CAUTION – Never operate the wrecker with the throttle control lever engaged.  5.2.3.3.2.1.3.  Hoist cables and cable spools.  The cables operate various raising and  lifting  components,  to  pull  vehicles  on  flatbeds,  and  for  snatch  block operations (explained later).    5.2.3.3.2.2.  Warning lights.  5.2.3.3.2.2.1.1.  Other  than  the  four-way  emergency  flashers,  wreckers have additional beacon type lights mounted on the upper most part of the wrecker.  5.2.3.3.2.2.1.2.  During  recovery  operations,  these  additional  warning lights help to warn/caution other motorist to slow down.  They serve as a safety device to the operator as well as warning to passing and oncoming traffic. Figure 5.4.  Hoist Control Levels.   5.2.3.3.3.   Flatbed wrecker.  There are two main components; the bed that raises and extends out to allow a vehicle to be pulled onto the bed and the cable spool that is used to retrieve the disabled vehicle onto the bed of the wrecker.  5.2.3.3.4.   Wheel-lift  wrecker,  main  component  is  the  wheel-lift.    Has  one  main component, the wheel-lift mechanism (see Figure 5.5.), which is usually driven by hydraulics.  It extends out and under the vehicle and then picks up the vehicle by either the front or rear wheels.  5.2.3.3.5.   Hook wrecker.    Figure 5.5.  Wheel-Lift Component.     5.2.3.3.5.1.  Tow  bar  assembly  (sling  and  regular  tow  bar,  usually  padded  with rubber).  See Figure 5.6.  5.2.3.3.5.1.1.  Sling tow bar assembly.  The spacer maintains a positive space between the towed vehicle and the wrecker.  The chain hooks are hooked to the rear axle of the tow vehicle and then hooked onto the tow bar of the wrecker.  The hoist cables then lift up the vehicle. Figure 5.6.  Sling Tow Bar Assembly.    5.2.3.3.5.2.  Boom.   5.2.3.3.5.2.1.  The boom supports the weight of the vehicle being towed.  The hoist cables run through the boom.  5.2.3.3.5.2.2.  The boom is adjustable, the heavier the load, the higher the boom should be raised (usually no more than 30-45 degrees).  Heavier loads will put more weight on the rear of the vehicle, causing the front wheels to leave the ground.  5.2.3.3.5.2.3.  Raising the boom will place more weight on the front wheels.  Some booms split in the middle and swing out to the side of the wrecker for recovery type operations.     Note:  CAUTION – Never raise or lower the boom when a vehicle is attached to the tow bar assembly.  Doing so could cause injury to the operator and/or others, and it could damage the wrecker.  5.2.3.3.6.   Outriggers.  5.2.3.3.6.1.  Some wreckers are equipped with two outriggers, located on both sides of the vehicle just behind the cab of the truck.  They are used to stabilize the wrecker during recovery operations when the boom is swung to the side of the wrecker.  Figure 5.7.  Scotch Blocks.   5.2.4.  Equipment, equipment use and physics application.   5.2.4.1.  Scotch  blocks  (rear  wheel  chocks).    Hook  wreckers  come  equipped  with  rear scotch blocks for use in snatch block recovery operations.  They are used in conjunction with parking brakes.  5.2.4.2.  Weights/Formulas.  The following formula is used to indicate the towing capacity of any given tow truck.  The alpha characters in Table 5.1. below correspond with the alpha characters in Figure 5.8.  The most immediate source of information concerning load capacity of a wrecker can be found in its data plate.  Weight of towed vehicles can be found on the data plate or commercial capacity label on the driver’s door.  Table 5.1.  Weights/Formulas.  Variable  Description A B C D Weigh the truck, driver, fuel, and all equipment on any conventional weight scale.  (In pounds, record as #1) Measure the distance between the centers of the front axle and the rear axle.  (In inches, record as #2) Measure the distance from the center of the rear axle  to  the  towing  position  of  the  tow  bar  or cross arm.  (In inches, record as #3) Divide front axle weight (#1) by 2; multiply that number with wheel base (#2).  Sum is known as inch pounds.  Divide inch pounds by overhang (#3).  Sum is the tow capacity of truck.  Note:  Always tow within the three basic ratings (Gross Axle Weight Rating [GAWR], Gross Combination Weight Rating [GCWR], and Gross Vehicle Weight Rating [GVWR]).    Figure 5.8.  Towing Capacity Determination Formula.  5.2.4.3.  Survey the scene.  Other than recovering the disabled vehicle, the trainee will be required to ensure the work area is safe and conducting a preliminary analysis of the scene.  5.2.4.4.  Emergency  warning  devices.    Follow  these  guidelines  when  placing  warning devices (warning triangles or flares).  Use extreme caution due to moving traffic.  5.2.4.4.1.   Two-lane road.  Traffic side of vehicle, 10ft front and 10ft/100ft rear.  See Figure 5.9.  5.2.4.4.2.   Curves/hills.  10ft and 300ft to the rear.  See Figure 5.9.  5.2.4.4.3.   Divided highway.  10ft, 100ft, and 200ft to the rear.  See Figure 5.9.    Figure 5.9.  Tow-Lane (Left) and Curves and Hills (Right).      5.2.4.5.  Hazardous materials.  Survey the scene prior to any recovery operations.  A few examples  of  hazards  are  leaking  fluids  (especially  dangerous  are  explosive  types)  and hazardous chemical spills.  Immediately clear the scene if hazardous materials are present and proceed only when give authorization from appropriate authorities.  5.2.4.6.  Check the weight of disabled vehicle.  5.2.4.7.  Some  locations  may  ask  the  operator  to  take  pictures  of  the  disabled/wrecked vehicle at the accident scene.  5.2.4.8.  Determine points of pickup on the disabled vehicle.  5.2.4.9.  Hoist cables and cable spools.  The following are safe practices for the use of cables and cable spools:  5.2.4.9.1.   Crossover.    Uneven  winding  of  the  cable  across  the  drum  will  cause excessive abuse of the cable, ensure the cable is rewound correctly, do not allow the cable to crossover; keep it uniform on the drum.  Note:  To wind the cable correctly and prevent crossover, place a weight on the end of the cable (on the hook) and wind cable.  5.2.4.9.2.   Freewheeling.  When necessary to let out large amount of cable, release the freewheeling cable device on the drum and pull out manually.  Failure to follow these procedures may result in crossover.    5.2.4.10.   Chains, hooks and snatch blocks.  5.2.4.10.1.  Chains.    Not  all  chains  are  suitable  for  towing/recovery.    Use  the  table below for the recommended chain types for towing/recovery.  Figure 5.10.  Recommended Towing/Recovery Chain Types.  Grade 7 Transport Chain (Towing) Grade 8 Alloy Chain (Recovery) Chain Size (in.) 1/4 5/16 3/8 7/16 1/2   Weight per 10 ft. (lbs.) Working Load Limit (lbs.) Weight per 10 ft. (lbs.) Working Load Limit (lbs.) 3,500 5,400 7,100 12,000 18,100 28,300 34,200 5/8 Grade 8 – Heavy recovery ~ 1/2 Grade 8 – Medium recovery ~ 3/8 Grade 8 – Light 3,150 4,700 6,600 8,750 11,300 7.2 11.4 14.8 24.3 35.1 58.4 70.5 8.1 9.8 14.1 21.6 24.6     Chain Size (in.) 9/32 (1/4) 5/16 3/8 1/2 5/8 3/4 7/8 recovery. Note:  CAUTION – Working Load Limit:  This is the maximum load in pounds, which should ever be applied to the chain, when the chain is in new or like new condition.  This rating applies when the load is uniformly applied, in direct tension, to a straight length of chain.  The operator puts themselves and others at risk of injury or death anytime they exceed limits.  Ensure he/she inspect chains before each use. 5.2.4.10.2.  Hooks.  There are many  types of hooks; the eye grab hook is the most popular used by wrecker manufacturers.  The clevis grab hook is also another option (see Figure 5.11.).  Figure 5.11.  Hook Types.      5.2.4.10.3.  Snatch blocks.  A snatch block is a pulley with a hook on one end.  Properly used a snatch block will increase the winching capability during recovery operations.  Note:    WARNING  –  Misused  or  poorly  maintained  blocks  are  killers  of  wrecker  personnel.  Always ensure the hook is in the correct winching position.   5.2.4.10.3.1. If the hook fails, it will move in the direction of the back of the hook.  Therefore, always place the hooks so their back is facing the ground or away from the operator.  Because there are different types of snatch blocks, the operator may want to consider having an instruction book that will show the maintenance and operation of the snatch block.  5.2.4.10.3.2. Do not winch two snatch blocks closer together than 36 inches.  5.2.4.10.4.  Inspection.  Check points to consider:  5.2.4.10.4.1. Check wear and deformities on pins, side plates, bushings or bearing. 5.2.4.10.4.2. Look for misalignment or wobble in the sheaves. 5.2.4.10.4.3. Inspect security of nuts, bolts, pins, and other locking methods. 5.2.4.10.4.4. Lubricate frequently depending on use and environmental conditions.     Figure 5.12.  Snatch Block Configurations.     5.2.4.11.   General Tow Procedures.  Do not tow a vehicle on its drive wheels unless steps have been taken to protect its transmission and differential.  This may require the drive shaft removal (only on rear wheel drive vehicles) to prevent damage to the transmission or the use of a tow dolly on the trailing wheels.  5.2.4.11.1.  The best option is to use the tow dolly due to the complexity and tools required to remove the drive shaft.  If the drive shaft has to be removed, recommend a vehicle mechanic remove it.   5.2.4.11.2.  When towing a vehicle from the rear, ensure the steering wheel is secured with the front wheels straight.  Most wreckers are equipped with a strap/hook device for securing the steering wheel.  If a strap/hook device is not available, then use a rope, strap, or chain to secure the steering wheel.  5.2.4.11.3.  Always use two safety chains on a tow. (N/A for wheel-lift wreckers)     5.3. Vehicle Inspection.  5.3.1.  Types of vehicle inspection.  If discrepancies are found they must be reported to Vehicle Control Officer/Vehicle Control Non Commissioned Officer (VCO/VCNCO), the supervisor, and/or vehicle maintenance:  5.3.1.1.  Pre-trip inspection – find items/problems that could cause accident or breakdown.  5.3.1.1.1.   Approaching the vehicle.  5.3.1.1.1.1.  Notice general condition. 5.3.1.1.1.2.

Winch cables (also called wire ropes).  Immediately have damaged cables replaced, failure to do so can  result in cable backlash,  which may  cause injury or death.   The following are items to look for:  5.3.1.1.14.3.1.  Properly lubricated.  5.3.1.1.14.3.2.  No frays or cuts in cable. 5.3.1.1.14.3.3.  Has not been crushed. 5.3.1.1.14.3.4.  No kinks. 5.3.1.1.14.3.5.  No bird caging.  The twisting of the wire rope in an isolated area in the opposite direction of the rope lay, causing it to take on a bird cage appearance. 5.3.1.1.14.3.6.  Properly wrap around on cable spool. 5.3.1.1.14.3.7.  Loose cable fastening devices.  Need to ensure they are properly installed and securely fastened.  These devices are located at a hanging point, for the wrecker, this is going to be where the hook attaches to the cable.  Two most  common  types  of  fasteners  are  the  U-bolt  wire  clip  and  compression sleeve (see Figure 5.14.).  The U-bolt wire clips have a correct and incorrect way of being fastened to the cable (see Figure 5.15.).  The saddle of the clip rests against the ``live'' portion of the wire rope while the U-bolt rests on the short end of the cable (also called the “dead” portion of the cable).  Using clips improperly severely weakens the connection, making it unsafe.  A good way to remember if fastened correctly is “never saddle a dead horse”.       Note:  Report any type of cable damage found to the VCO/VCNCO or the supervisor immediately.  Figure 5.14.  Cable Frays and Cuts (Left) and Cable U-bolt Wire Clip and Compression Sleeve (Right).      Figure 5.15.  Correct and Incorrect Methods for U-Bolt Wire Clips.    5.3.1.1.15.  Pulleys.  5.3.1.1.16.  Tow bar and/or tow bar sling.  5.3.1.1.17.  Outriggers.  5.3.1.1.18.  Pintle hook is equipped.  5.3.1.1.19.  Exposed gears, check for condition/damage and proper lubrication.  5.3.1.2.  Emergency equipment (mandatory items):  5.3.1.2.1.   Fire extinguisher(s) (properly charged, inspection is current, and secured).  5.3.1.2.2.   Warning devices for parked vehicles (warning triangles and/or flares).    5.3.1.2.3.   First aid kit (ensure restocked and not expired). 5.3.1.2.4.   Towed vehicle light attachments. 5.3.1.3.  Inspections during operations:  5.3.1.3.1.   All gauges and warning lights for proper operations:  Warning lights, gauges and indicators.  5.3.1.3.1.1.  Most warning lights will show when the ignition is in the start position to show proper operation of the bulb.  Some gauges will “peg” to one side showing operation.    Once  the  engine  has  started  these  warning  lights  should  go  out  and gauges will go to appropriate readings.  5.3.1.3.1.2.  It is important to become familiar with the proper operating readings of  gauges;  specific  meaning  of  warning  and  indicator  lights  and  what  to  do  if indications are warning of a malfunction on the wrecker being operated.  5.3.1.3.1.3.  Some  wreckers  will  have  all  these  items  and  some  will  be  limited.  Along with indicators and gauges; warning lights may service the same function.  5.3.1.3.1.4.  Warning  lights  provide  notification  to  situations  that  require immediate attention.  5.3.1.3.1.4.1.  Low  air  pressure  light  –  wait  for  pressure  to  build  up  before moving wrecker.  5.3.1.3.1.4.2.  Low engine oil light – check engine oil level.  5.3.1.3.1.4.3.  Parking light is engaged – will remain on until parking brake is released.  5.3.1.3.1.5.  Gauges:  Gauges let the operator monitor wrecker systems.    Table 5.2.  Gauges.  Display       Description Hour Meter - operates when the key switch is ON and the engine is running.  Ammeter - actuates once the ignition switch is ON, shows the amount of AMPS the alternator is putting out. Transmission Oil Temperature - actuates once the ignition switch is ON, shows reading of transmission fluid temperature. Coolant System Temperature - actuates once the ignition switch is ON, shows reading of engine coolant temperature. Engine Oil Pressure - actuates once the ignition switch is ON and the engine is running, shows reading of engine oil pressure System Air Pressure - actuates once the ignition switch is ON, shows reading of system air pressure. Response Periodic maintenance and vehicle rotations are based on these hours. Normal ammeters indicate red or green.  If the gauge shows red check for alternator belt tension first. During heavy movement or driving on inclines the transmission temperature will increase.  If it shows over heating discontinue use and let the vehicle cool.  Check fluid level. During heavy movement or driving on inclines the transmission temperature will increase.  If it shows over heating discontinue use and let the vehicle cool.  Check coolant level. When the engine is cold and oil viscosity is less, the gauge should read a high oil pressure.  If oil pressure drops below required level, discontinue use; check engine oil level. To release the parking brake, system air pressure normally requires 60 psi.  Some systems are split and the gauge will have two indicators.  If air pressure drops below required level the parking brakes will apply.   5.3.1.3.2.   Wrecker  controls.    Refer  to  Manufacturer’s  Operator’s  Manual  for  more information regarding controls on specific wrecker type.   5.3.1.3.3.   Unusual noises.  Listen for any unusual, irregular motions, or vibrations.  Use the senses to check for problems (look, listen, smell, feel).  If encountered, the operator  should  stop  the  wrecker  and  investigate  the  cause,  if  cause  cannot  be determined, then report to the Squadron VCO/VCNCO, the supervisor, and/or vehicle maintenance.  5.3.1.3.4.   Listen for exhaust and air leaks.  Exhaust leaks are often confused with other sounds.  Exhaust systems can leak from anywhere, though the mating flanges at the cylinders; silencer and tailpipe extensions are the usual spots.  Another typical exhaust sound is a whistle as the engine is accelerated.  For air leaks, there may be escaping air, a continuous hissing noise.  Also, low air pressure may be an indicator there may be an air leak.  5.3.1.4.  After operation inspection:  5.3.1.4.1.   All gear is properly stowed (i.e. chains, hooks, dolly, etc.).  5.3.1.4.2.   Cables are properly aligned on spool.  5.3.1.4.3.   Ensure the wrecker is cleaned.  5.3.1.4.4.   Refueled.  5.3.1.4.5.   Perform a walk around inspection.  5.3.1.4.6.   Drain air tanks if applicable.  5.3.1.5.  Pre-trip vehicle inspection test.  Use Attachment 2 as a walk around guide along with AF Form 1800.  5.3.2.  A Seven-Step Inspection Method will help ensure the inspection is the same each time it is conducted, and that nothing is left out.  See Attachment 4 for the Seven-Step Inspection Method.  Note:    Report  any  safety  type  discrepancy  to  the  VCO/VCNCO  or  the  supervisor  for  action.  Remove vehicle from service immediately.  5.4. Vehicle Safety and Equipment.  5.4.1.  Hazards and human factors:  5.4.1.1.  Traffic while retrieving a disabled vehicle.  5.4.1.2.  Crush  points  when  backing  the  wrecker  to  the  disabled  vehicle.    Never  allow anyone to stand between the disabled vehicle and wrecker.  5.4.1.3.  Cables.  Under tension they present the greatest danger.  Always stay outside of the danger zone.  5.4.1.4.  Common operator mishaps:  5.4.1.4.1.   Lifting a towed vehicle beyond the wrecker’s capability.    5.4.1.4.2.   Jerky starts and stops. 5.4.1.4.3.   Traveling too fast.  5.4.1.4.4.   Turning too sharply.  5.4.1.4.5.   Cutting corners too sharply.  5.4.1.4.6.   Not properly securing the towed vehicle. 5.4.2.  Safety clothing and equipment:  5.4.2.1.  Safety steel-toed boots must be worn.  5.4.2.2.  Gloves will be worn during recovery operations unloading (take off rings/jewelry first.  5.4.2.3.  Reflective vest will be worn during recovery operations.  The vest will make the operator more visible to the traffic.  5.4.2.4.  First aid kit.  5.4.2.5.  Warning triangles or flares.  5.4.2.6.  Fire extinguisher.  5.4.2.7.  Coveralls.  5.4.2.8.  Raingear, cold weather gear, etc.  5.4.2.9.  Eye protection.  5.4.2.10.  Hearing protection.  5.4.2.11.   Driving Safely in addition to Standardized Government Motor Vehicle Lesson Plan.  5.4.2.12.   AF Form 1800.  5.5. Driving Safety and Precautions.  5.5.1.  Overview Safety and Precautions.  The following are safety items and procedures to be followed during wrecker operations.  The Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual will also provide safe  operating  procedures  and  the  vehicle  itself  may  have  warning,  cautions,  and  danger stickers that the Vehicle Operator should be aware of.  5.5.1.1.  General Safety and Precautions.  5.5.1.1.1.   Operator  and  passengers  shall  wear  seat  belts  and  shoulder  harnesses  as provided. 5.5.1.1.2.   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment consistent with the hazard. 5.5.1.1.3.   No personnel shall be allowed to ride anywhere, except in the cab of the wrecker and never to exceed the number of seatbelt equipped.  Never let anyone ride in the towed vehicle.  5.5.1.1.4.   Plan ahead to minimize or eliminate the need for backing.  See AFMAN 24-306 for additional guidance on safe backing procedures.  5.5.1.1.5.   Choose safest location possible to park equipment.  Avoid parking in other equipment's blind spot. 5.5.1.1.6.   When  mounting  or  dismounting  equipment,  use  steps  and  handholds provided.  Do not jump from vehicle.  5.5.1.1.7.   Truck speed should be adjusted for load, traffic, and weather.  Tire chains should be utilized as dictated by weather conditions.  5.5.1.1.8.   Operators should be aware of personnel in the work zone.  5.5.1.1.9.   Do  not  leave  equipment  unattended  with  the  engine  running.    Shut  off engine and set the parking brake when equipment is not in use.        5.5.1.2.  General wrecker operations safety.  5.5.1.2.1.   Always turn-on four-way and warning (beacons) lights when arriving at the recovery scene and in traffic when towing a vehicle. 5.5.1.2.2.   Do hook-ups from curb side to the maximum extent possible. 5.5.1.2.3.   Do not operate, walk, or stand beneath boom or a suspended load to lift load. 5.5.1.2.4.   Do not overload truck and always use proper engine speed and gear ratio to lift the load.                 5.5.1.2.5.   Never  exceed  load  limit  and/or  boom  rating  (know  the  load  and  weight limits). 5.5.1.2.6.   Never travel with the PTO control engaged. 5.5.1.2.7.   Do not move wrecker with booms split or outriggers extended. 5.5.1.2.8.   Do not use entire cable length. 5.5.1.2.9.   Do not continue to wind the winch cable after the hook is against the boom end. 5.5.1.2.10.  When the boom is raised, never put the selector in the down position and let go of the crank. A runaway crank could result in injury or death.  Never use the crank when the boom has a load on it. 5.5.1.2.11.  Never disengage the wrecker service drum engagement control when the cable is loaded. 5.5.1.2.12.  Never apply lubricant or perform any kind of maintenance while wrecker equipment is operating. 5.5.1.2.13.  Always unlatch the hood of the disabled vehicle when lifting its front end.  Leave the safety catch engaged. 5.5.1.2.14.  Stay clear of all moving parts, cables, shafts, belts, flywheels, etc. 5.5.1.2.15.  Do not move wrecker with an unsecured load hanging from boom. 5.5.1.2.16.  Never get under a disabled vehicle that is raised by the wrecker.  If the operator needs to  get under a raised vehicle, it should have  adequate safety  blocks and/or jack stands in place. 5.5.1.2.17.  Use  two  safety  chains  on  all  tows  (not  applicable  (N/A)  for  wheel-lift wreckers). 5.5.1.2.18.  Do not tow a vehicle at night without proper signal lights on the towed vehicle and the wrecker. 5.5.1.2.19.  Keep the towed load within one foot of the ground whenever possible. 5.5.1.2.20.  Check boom before each use for cracks, deformities, oil leaks or loose pins, nuts and bolts.  5.5.1.2.21.  When  possible  during  dangerous  and  complicated  vehicle  recoveries, ensure other qualified wreckers operators assist in recovery.  5.5.2.  Tire changing safety.  If a tire is changed incorrectly, it can cause serious injury to the operator, surrounding personnel  5.5.2.1.  Consider the vehicle location.  Avoid changing a tire on a bridge, curve, road with no shoulder, etc.  5.5.2.2.  Find a firm and level surface for the jack.  5.5.2.3.  Turn-on four-way flashers.  5.5.2.4.  Place warning triangles or flares prior to changing the tire.  5.5.2.5.  Block the wheels - if changing a front tire, block the rear wheels, visa-versa if changing a rear tire.  5.5.2.6.  Place the vehicle in “Park” if an automatic transmission and low gear if a standard shift.  Apply the parking brake.  5.5.2.7.  Ensure the jack is rated for the weight of the vehicle.  5.5.2.8.  Ensure proper placement of jack (check for manufacturer’s recommendation).  If available, use jack stands after lifting the vehicle.  5.5.2.9.  Once vehicle is lifted, NEVER at any time get under the vehicle.  5.5.2.10.   Before removing lug nuts, ensure lug wedges are loose (double check).  5.5.2.11.   After changing the tire, it is important to return the jack and lug wrench to the location recommended by the manufacturer.  This prevents these tools from becoming a projectile, and makes them available for the next tire changing event.  5.5.2.12.   Secure the removed tire and once it is repaired return the spare tire back to its proper location.  5.6. Wrecker Vehicle Operation.  5.6.1.  Operating a wrecker with a vehicle attached is difficult.  Extra attention should be taken due to the added weight and length added to the wrecker during recovery operations.  5.6.2.  Accelerating.  Gradually accelerate so the vehicle does not jerk.  Rapid acceleration can cause  mechanical  failure  and  is  considered  vehicle  abuse.    During  inclement  weather,  and towing operations speed should be gradually increased to prevent drive wheels from spinning.  5.6.3.  Steering.  Aim high in steering, which means always looking ahead at the vehicle in front.  Watching for brake lights, turn signals, possible fog, etc.  5.6.3.1.  Holding the steering wheel.  Two hands are necessary during operation. Refer to AFMAN 24-306 for more information.  5.6.3.2.  Right/left turns.  When rounding a corner or making any sharp turns, use the hand-over-hand steering method.  While completing the turn and release pressure on the steering wheel, it will slide through the hands because the front wheels tend to return to their normal straight forward position.  Keep in mind the longer turning radius due to vehicle being towed with the hook and wheel-lift wreckers. 5.6.4.  Shifting gears. 5.6.4.1.  Using engine speed, revolutions per minute (rpm).  Study the owner’s manual for proper procedures for the vehicle being operated.  5.6.4.2.  Use road speed, miles per hour (mph).  Learn what speed each gear is designed for.  5.6.4.2.1.   Knowing where/why to shift.     5.6.4.2.1.1.  Steep  grades.    Make  sure  the  vehicle  is  in  a  low  enough  gear  to maintain a safe speed and to prevent the engine from stalling.  On declines, the gear selected should be one lower than the gear used to climb the same hill.  This will help prevent brake failure. 5.6.4.2.1.2.  Curves.  Downshift to help maintain control through the curve and to ensure proper gear selection when accelerating out of the curve.  5.6.5.  Braking.  Reference AFMAN 24-306.  Maintain a space cushion; try to keep space around the vehicle at all times.  Watch the following distance; due to the size and weight (more if towing a vehicle) use the three-second rule when following other vehicles.  5.6.5.1.  Controlling speed.  Adjust the speed depending on driving conditions.  5.6.5.2.  Normal stopping.  The following factors affect the ability to stop.  5.6.5.2.1.   Speed.  5.6.5.2.2.   Towing capacity.  5.6.5.2.3.   Inclement weather.  5.6.5.2.4.   Condition of tires and brakes.  5.6.5.2.5.   Type and condition of road surface.  5.6.5.2.6.   Weight of the wrecker.  Increase when towing a vehicle.  5.6.5.3.  Emergency stopping.  For any speed, the distance required to stop a vehicle in an emergency depends on three things:  5.6.5.3.1.   Perception distance.  This is the distance the vehicle travels from the time the eyes see a hazard until the brain recognizes it.  5.6.5.3.2.   Reaction distance.  This is the distance traveled by the vehicle during which the driver determines the preventive action to be taken and actually sets the controls in motion.  5.6.5.3.3.   Braking distance.  The distance it takes to stop once the brakes are applied.  5.6.6.  Backing.  Many injuries and deaths have occurred from improper use of spotters.  The majority of incidents and accidents can be avoided by using a spotter.  Backing without a spotter should only be accomplished as a last resort.  Exhaust every effort to locate a spotter.  The following guidelines will be used during backing operations:  5.6.6.1.  Operator and spotter should use spotting signals found in AFMAN 24-306 before backing.  5.6.6.2.  The operator should always maintain visual contact with the spotter(s).  5.6.6.3.  The operator must stop immediately if spotter moves out of the view or it is hard to understand the hand signals being.  5.6.6.4.  Check clearance/surroundings.  5.6.6.5.  Sound horn.  5.6.6.6.  Use mirrors.    5.6.6.7.  Pull forward to reposition. 5.6.6.8.  Back slowly.  5.6.7.  Additional items. 5.6.6.9.  Avoid  backing  with  an  attached  towed  vehicle  (hook  wrecker).    There  is  a potential to cause damage to the grill with the hoist cables.  5.6.7.1.  Flightline rules and regulations (when applicable).  Refer to AFMAN 24-306, AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving, and local flightline procedures.  5.6.7.2.  Fire  extinguisher training.    Wreckers are  equipped with fire extinguishers and training is required annually.  The supervisor or Squadron VCO will schedule training with the local Fire Department.  The fire extinguisher itself must be inspected to ensure current inspection date, ensure needle is positioned in the green and ensure it is securely mounted.  5.6.7.3.  Workplace policies and procedures.  Understand local policies and procedures in regards to wrecker operations.  If at a temporary duty location, take the time to learn the policies and procedures for the current location.  Section 6—EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION  6.1. Instructor’s Preparation.  6.1.1.  Establish a training location.  6.1.2.  Obtain appropriate vehicle operator’s manual.  6.1.3.  Schedule/reserve a wrecker.  6.1.4.

Do not jump from vehicle, use handholds provided.  6.2.1.7.5.   Do hook-ups from curb side to the maximum extent possible.  6.2.1.7.6.   Minimize or eliminate the need for backing.  6.2.1.3.7.   Reflective vest.  6.2.1.3.8.   Hearing protection.  6.2.1.3.9.   Eye protection.  6.2.1.7.6.1.  Use a spotter.  (When a spotter is not available, exit wrecker and check clearances).  6.2.1.7.6.2.  Operator and spotter agree on hand signals before backing.  Refer to AFMAN 24-306 for standardized hand signals to use.  6.2.1.7.6.3.  Always check to the rear before backing.  6.2.1.7.6.4.  Stop immediately if the spotter moves out of the view of the mirror.  6.2.1.7.6.5.  Ensure back-up alarms are working properly.  6.2.1.7.7.   Do not operate, walk, or stand beneath boom or a suspended load.  6.2.1.7.8.   Never travel with the PTO control engaged.  6.2.1.7.9.   Do not move wrecker with booms split or outriggers extended.  6.2.1.7.10.  Do not use entire cable length.  6.2.1.7.11.  Do not continue to wind the winch cable when hook is against boom end.  6.2.1.7.12.  Never put the selector in the down position and let go of the crank.  Could result in injury or death.  Never use the crank when the boom has a load on it.  6.2.1.7.13.  Never disengage the wrecker service drum engagement control when the cable is loaded.  6.2.1.7.14.

Have  trainee  re-perform  until  they  show  proficiency  in  operating,  critique weaknesses as observed.        8.1.1.  Safe operation of a CMV with an air brake system, requires knowledge of:  Air Brake System  nomenclature;  the  dangers  of  contaminated  air  supply;  implications  of  severed  or disconnected  air  lines  between  the  power  unit  and  the  wrecker(s);  implications  of  low  air pressure readings; procedures to conduct safe and accurate pre-trip inspections; procedures for conducting en-route and post-trip inspections of air actuated brake systems (ability to detect defects, which may cause the system to fail). 8.1.2.  Air brakes are really three different braking systems: 8.1.2.1.1.   Service brake.  Applies and releases the brakes when using the brake to pedal during normal driving. 8.1.2.1.2.   Parking  brake.    Applies  and  releases  the  parking  brakes  when  using  the parking brake control. 8.1.2.1.3.   Emergency brake.  Uses part of the service and parking brake systems to stop the vehicle in the event of a brake system failure.  8.1.3.  Parts of an Air Brake System:   Figure 8.1.  Air Brake System Components.    8.1.3.1.  Air  compressor.    Pumps  air  into  the  air  storage  tanks  (reservoirs).    The  air compressor is connected to the engine through gears or a v-belt.  The compressor may be air cooled or may be cooled by the engine cooling system.  It may have its own oil supply, or be lubricated by engine oil.  If the compressor has its own oil supply, check the oil level before driving.  8.1.3.2.  Air compressor governor.  The governor controls when the air compressor will pump air into the air storage tanks.  When air tank pressure rises to the “cut-out’ level (around  125  pounds  per  square  inch  or  psi),  the  governor  stops  the  compressor  from pumping air.  When the tank pressure falls to the “cut-in” pressure (around 100 psi), the governor allows the compressor to start pumping again.  8.1.3.3.  Air storage tanks.  Air storage tanks are used to hold compressed air.  The number and size of air tanks varies among vehicles.  The tanks will hold enough air to allow the brakes to be used several times, even if the compressor stops working.  8.1.3.4.  Air tank drains.  Compressed air usually has some water and some compressor oil in it which is bad for the air brake system.  The water can freeze in cold weather and cause brake failure.  Drain the air tanks completely.  Each air tank is equipped with a drain valve in the bottom.  There are two types:  8.1.3.4.1.   Manually  operated.    Turn  a  quarter  turn  or  pull  a  cable  to  operate.    See Figure 8.2.  Manually drain the tank at the end of each day of driving.  8.1.3.4.2.   Automatic.    The  water  and  oil  is  automatically  expelled.    They  may  be equipped for manual draining as well.  Automatic air tanks are available with electric heating devices to help prevent freezing of the automatic drain cold weather.  Figure 8.2.  Manual Drain Valve.    8.1.3.5.  Alcohol evaporator.  Some air brake systems have an alcohol evaporator to put alcohol into the air system.  This helps to reduce the risk of ice in air brake valves and other parts during cold weather which can make the brakes stop working.  Check and fill the alcohol container as necessary, every day during cold weather.  8.1.3.6.  Safety valve.  A safety relief valve is installed in the first tank the air compressor pumps air to.  The safety valve protects the tank and the rest of the system from too much pressure.  The valve is usually set to open at 150 psi.   If the safety valve releases  air, something is wrong.  8.1.3.7.  The brake pedal.  Put on the brakes by pushing down the brake pedal.  (It is also called the foot valve or treadle valve.)  8.1.3.7.1.   Pushing the pedal down harder applies more air pressure.  Letting up on the brake pedal reduces the air pressure and releases the brakes.  Releasing the brakes lets some compressed air go out of the system, so the air pressure in the tanks is reduced.  8.1.3.7.2.   It must be made up by the air compressor.  Pressing and releasing the pedal unnecessarily can let air out faster than the compressor can replace it.  If the pressure gets too low, the brakes won't work. 8.1.4.  Foundation brakes.  Used at each wheel.  The most common type is the s-cam drum brake, shown in Figure 8.3.  Its parts include:  8.1.4.1.  Brake drums, shoes, and linings.  Located on each end of the vehicle's axles.  The wheels are bolted to the drums.  The braking mechanism is inside the drum.  To stop, the brake shoes and linings are pushed against the inside of the drum.  This causes friction, which slows the vehicle (and creates heat).  The heat a drum can take without damage depends on how hard and how long the brakes are used.  Too much heat can make the brakes stop working.   8.1.4.2.  S-cam brakes.  When pushing the brake pedal, air is let into each brake chamber Air  pressure  pushes  the  rod  out,  moving  the  slack  adjuster,  thus  twisting  the  brake camshaft.  This turns the s-cam (so called because it is shaped like the letter "S").  The s-cam forces the brake shoes away from one another and presses them against the inside of the brake drum.  When releasing the brake pedal, the s-cam rotates back and a spring pulls the brake shoes away from the drum, letting the wheels roll freely again.  Figure 8.3.  S-cam Air Brakes.    8.1.4.3.  Wedge brakes.  The brake chamber push rod pushes a wedge directly between the ends of two brake shoes.  This shoves them apart and against the inside of the brake drum.  Wedge brakes may have a single brake chamber, or two brake chambers, pushing wedges in at both ends of the brake shoes.  Wedge type brakes may be self-adjusting or may require manual adjustment.  8.1.4.4.  Disc brakes.  In air-operated disc brakes, air pressure acts on a brake chamber and slack adjuster, like s-cam brakes.  But instead of the s-cam, a "power screw" is used.  The pressure of the brake chamber on the slack adjuster turns the power screw.  The power screw clamps the disc or rotor between the brake lining pads of a caliper, similar to a large c-clamp.  8.1.5.  Supply pressure gauges.  All air-braked vehicles have a pressure gauge connected to the air tank.  If the vehicle has a dual air brake system, there will be a gauge for each half of the system.  (Or a single gauge with two needles.)  Dual systems will be discussed later.  These gauges tell how much pressure is in the air tanks.  8.1.6.  Application pressure gauge.  This gauge shows how much air pressure is being applied   to the brakes.  (This gauge is not on all vehicles.)  Increasing application pressure to hold the same speed means the brakes are fading.  The operator should slow down and use a lower gear.  The need for increased pressure can also be caused by brakes out of adjustment, air leaks, or mechanical problems.   8.1.7.  Low air pressure warning.  A low air pressure warning signal is required on vehicles with air brakes.  A warning signal that can be seen must come on before the air pressure in the tanks  falls  below  60  psi.    (Or  one  half  the  compressor  governor  cutout  pressure  on  older vehicles.)  The warning is usually a red light.  A buzzer may also come on.  8.1.7.1.  Another type of warning is the "wig wag."  This device drops a mechanical arm into the view when the pressure in the system drops below 60 psi.  An automatic wig wag will rise out of the view when the pressure in the system goes above 60 psi.  The manual reset type must be placed in the "out of view" position manually.  It will not stay in place until the pressure in the system is above 60 psi. 8.1.8.  Stop light switch.  Warns drivers behind the vehicle, who must be warned when the brakes are put on.  The air brake system does this with an electric switch that works by air pressure.  The switch turns on the brake lights when the air brakes are put on.      8.1.9.  Front brake limiting valve.  Some older vehicles (made before 1975) have a front brake limiting valve and a control in the cab.  The control is usually marked "normal" and "slippery."  When control is put in the "slippery" position, the limiting valve cuts the "normal" air pressure to the front brakes by half.  8.1.9.1.  Limiting valves were used to reduce the chance of the front wheels skidding on slippery surfaces.  However, they actually reduce the stopping power of the vehicle.  8.1.9.2.  Front wheel braking is good under all conditions.  Tests have shown front wheel skids from braking are not likely, even on ice.  Make sure the control is in the "normal" position to have normal stopping power. 8.1.9.3.  Many vehicles have automatic front wheel limiting valves.  They reduce the air to the front brakes except when the brakes are put on very hard (60 psi or more application pressure).  These valves cannot be controlled by the driver.  8.1.10.  Spring brakes.  Tractor and straight truck spring brakes will come fully on when air pressure drops to a range of 20 to 45 psi (typically 20 to 30 psi).  Do not wait for the brakes to come on automatically.  When the low air pressure warning light and buzzer first come on, bring the vehicle to a safe stop right away, while the brakes can be controlled.  Brakes must be properly adjusted to work correctly and to prevent the braking power from being affected. 8.1.11.  Parking brake controls.  In newer vehicles with air brakes, put on the parking brakes using a diamond-shaped, yellow, push-pull control knob.  Pull the knob out to put the parking brakes (spring brakes) on, and push it in to release them.  On older vehicles, the parking brakes may be controlled by a lever.  Use the parking brakes whenever the vehicle is being parked.  Note:  Never push the brake pedal down when the spring brakes are on.  The brakes could be damaged by the combined forces of the springs and the pressure.   8.1.11.1.   Modulating control valves.  A control handle on the dash board found in some vehicles that may be used to apply the spring brakes gradually.  It is spring loaded, so there is feel for the braking action.  The more the operator moves the control lever, the harder the spring brakes come on, so that the operator can control the spring brakes if the service brakes fail.  When parking a vehicle with a modulating control valve, move the lever as far as it will go and hold it in place with the locking device.  8.1.11.2.   Dual parking control valves.  A dual valve is used when main air pressure is lost to release the spring brakes, so the operator can move the vehicle in an emergency.  A push-pull type valve used to put the spring brakes for parking, and a spring loaded valve in the “out” position.  When the operator pushes the control in, air from the separate air tank releases the spring brakes so the vehicle can move.  When the operator releases the button, the spring brakes come on again.  There is only enough air in the separate tank to do this a few times. The operator needs to plan carefully when moving, or he/she may be stopped in a dangerous location when the separate air supply runs out.  8.1.11.3.   Antilock Braking System (ABS).  Truck tractors with air brakes built on or after March 1, 1997, and other air brakes vehicles, (trucks, buses, trailers, and converter dollies) built on or after March 1, 1998, are required to be equipped with antilock brakes.  ABS is a  computerized  system  that  keeps  the  wheels  from  locking  up  during  hard  brake applications.  .  8.1.11.3.1.  On newer vehicles, the malfunction lamp comes on at start-up for a bulb check, and then goes out quickly.  On an older system, the lamp could stay on until the vehicle is driving over 5 mph.  8.1.11.3.2.  If the lamp stays on after the bulb check, or goes on once the vehicle is under way, it may have lost ABS control at one or more wheels.  8.1.11.3.3.  ABS is in addition to the normal brakes.  It does not decrease or increase the normal braking capability.  It only activates when wheels are about to lock up. 8.1.12.  Dual  air  brakes.    Two  separate  air  brake  systems  which  use  a  single  set  of  brake controls.  Each system has its own air tanks, hoses, lines, etc.  Both systems supply air to the wrecker (if there is one).  8.1.12.1.   One system (the “Primary”) typically operates regular brakes on rear axle or axles.  8.1.12.2.   The other system (the “Secondary”) operates regular brakes on front axle (and possibly one rear axle).  8.1.12.3.   Before  driving  a  vehicle,  allow  time  for  the  air  compressor  to  build  up  a minimum  of  100  psi  pressure  in  both  the  primary  and  secondary  systems,  or  to  the recommended psi in the Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual.   Note:  Pay attention to the low air pressure warning light and buzzer.  Never operate if the warning light or buzzer is on (typically when the air pressure drops below 60 psi).  Bring the vehicle to a stop right away and safely park the vehicle if this happens while driving.  8.1.13.  Inspecting air brakes, the following are added items to be included in Step 2 “Engine Compartment Checks”, Step 5 “Walk-Around Inspecting”, and Step 7 “Final Air Brake Check” of the Seven-Step Inspection Process.  See Attachment 4.  Note:  If any of the below tests fail, they must reported to VCO/VCNCO, the supervisor, and or vehicle maintenance:  8.2. Using Air Brakes.  8.2.1.  Normal stops.  Push the brake pedal down.  Control the pressure so the vehicle comes to a smooth, safe stop.  If the vehicle has a manual transmission, do not push the clutch in until the engine rpm is down close to idle.  When stopped, select a starting gear.  8.2.2.  Emergency stops.  When stopping in an emergency situation, brake in a way that will keep the vehicle in a straight line and allow to turn if it becomes necessary.  Controlled or stab braking methods can be used.  Note:  If driving a vehicle with anti-lock brakes, read and follow the directions found in the owner’s manual for stopping quickly:  8.2.2.1.  Controlled braking:  8.2.2.1.1.   Apply the brakes as hard as can be done without locking the wheels.  8.2.2.1.2.   Keep steering wheel movements very small while doing this.  8.2.2.1.3.   Release the brakes if needed to make a larger steering adjustment or if the wheels lock, and reapply the brakes as soon as possible.  8.2.2.2.  Stab braking:  8.2.2.2.1.   Apply the brakes all the way.  8.2.2.2.2.   Release brakes when wheels lock up.  8.2.2.2.3.   As soon as the wheels start rolling, apply the brakes fully again.  8.2.3.  Stopping distance.  The total stopping distance for vehicles with air brake systems is made up of four different factors:  Perception Distance + Reaction Distance + Brake Lag Distance + Effective Braking Distance = Total Stopping Distance  8.2.4.  Brake fading or failure:  8.2.4.1.  Brakes can fade or fail from excessive heat caused by using them too much and not relying on the engine braking effect.  Excessive heat causes chemical changes in the brake lining which reduces friction and causes expansion of the brake drums. 8.2.4.2.  Brake fade is also affected by adjustment.  Brakes out of adjustment will not be able to share the workload with brakes that are properly adjusted, causing the other brakes to overheat and fade from overuse.  8.2.5.  Proper Braking Technique.  Once the vehicle is in the proper low gear, follow the proper braking  technique:    Note:    The  use  of  brakes  on  along  and/or  steep  downgrade  is  only  a supplement to the braking effect of the engine.   8.2.5.1.  Apply the brakes just hard enough to feel a definite slowdown.  8.2.5.2.  When the speed has been reduced to approximately 5 mph below the "safe" speed, release the brakes (for appx. 3 seconds).  8.2.5.3.  When the speed has increased to the "safe" speed, repeat the above.  8.2.6.  Low Air Pressure:  8.2.6.1.  If the low air pressure warning comes on, stop and safely park the vehicle as soon as possible.  8.2.6.2.  Spring brakes will come on when the air pressure drops into the range of 20 to 45 psi.  8.2.7.  Parking Brakes.  To use the parking brake, pull the parking brake control knob out.  The control will be a yellow, diamond shaped knob labeled “parking brakes” on newer vehicles.  On older vehicles, it may be a round blue knob or some other shape (including a lever that swings from side to side or up and down).  Note:  Never leave the vehicle unattended without applying the parking brakes or chock the wheels.  The vehicle might roll away and cause injury and damage.  8.2.7.1.  Do not use the parking brakes if the brakes are very hot or they can be damaged (e.g. from just coming down a steep grade).  Let hot brakes cool before using the parking brakes.  8.2.7.2.  Do not use the parking brakes if the brakes are very wet in freezing temperatures (vehicle will not be able to move if they freeze).  Use wheel chocks to hold the vehicle.  If brakes are wet, use the brakes lightly while driving in a low gear to heat and dry them.  8.2.7.3.  If the vehicle does not have automatic air tank drains, drain air tanks to remove the moisture and oil.  8.2.8.  Safety Reminders.  8.2.8.1.  ABS will not prevent power or turning skids.  8.2.8.2.  ABS will not increase or decrease ultimate stopping power.  8.2.8.3.  ABS will not necessarily shorten stopping distance.  8.2.8.4.  ABS will not change the way the vehicle normally brakes.   Attachment 1   GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION References AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving, 1 June 2011 AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, 5 May 2016 AFMAN 24-306, Operation of Air Force Government Motor Vehicles, 9 December 2016  Adopted Forms AF Form 171, Request for Driver’s Training and Addition to U.S. Government Drivers, 15 March 2011 AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, 22 September 2009 AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report, 1 April 2010  Abbreviations and Acronyms ABS—Antilock Brake System AF—Air Force AFI—Air Force Instruction AFIMSC—Air Force Installation Mission Support Center AFMAN—Air Force Manual AFQTP—Air Force Qualification Training Package GAWR—Gross Axle Weight Rating GCWR—Gross Combination Weight Rating GMV—Government Motor Vehicle GVWR—Gross Vehicle Weight Rating GVW—Gross Vehicle Weight IAW—In Accordance With MPH—Miles per Hour PTO—Power Take-off RM—Risk Management RPM—Revolutions per Minute TO—Technical Order VCNCO—Vehicle Control Non Commissioned Officer VCO—Vehicle Control Officer  GENERAL  STEP 1.

Test for hydraulic leaks. If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move.  If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. Set parking brake (power unit only). Place vehicle into a low gear. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. o o • o o o o o o o • o • Any unusual brake pedal "feel" or delayed stopping action can mean trouble. If the trainee finds anything unsafe during the Vehicle inspection, get it fixed. Federal and state laws forbid operating an unsafe vehicle. Check vehicle operation regularly: Instruments. Air pressure gauge (if the vehicle has air brakes). Temperature gauges. Pressure gauges. Ammeter/voltmeter. Mirrors. Tires. Cargo, cargo covers. Lights, etc. If the trainee sees, hears, smells, or feels anything that might mean trouble, he/she should check it out. Safety inspection. Drivers of trucks and truck tractors when transporting cargo must inspect the securement of the cargo within the first 50 miles of a trip and every 150 miles or every 3 hours (whichever comes first) after. Document any discrepancy on AF Form 1800.  Sign-off AF Form 1800 to signify accomplishment of inspection.  Figure A4.2.  Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes System.  Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes Step 2.  Engine Compartment Checks 5.  Walk-Around Inspecting • • o o o Procedure Check air compressor drive belt condition and tightness (if compressor is belt driven). Check manual slack adjusters on S-cam brakes.  Note:  Vehicles with automatic slack adjustors still must be checked. Park on level ground and chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes so the operator can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that it can be reached. 7.  Final Air Brake Check o • • o o o o • o o o o o • o o Check slack adjuster, more than 1-inch indicates adjustments required (vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time. If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate. • o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 o o o o • psi). Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. o o • o o o o o o   • • • • After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure. Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Compressor should cut-in at manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure. Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. Wait for normal air pressure. Release the parking brake. Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action.
