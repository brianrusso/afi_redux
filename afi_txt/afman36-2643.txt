Responsibilities. 1.1.  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Manpower,  Personnel  and  Services  (HQ  USAF/A1)  is  the OPR and establishes mentoring guidance as reflected in this Air Force Manual. 1.2.  MAJCOMs and local units facilitate the mentoring process to provide Airmen with the ability to develop to their full potential. 1.3.  Air Force leaders are expected to ensure Airmen are provided mentoring opportunities as described in this Manual. 1.4.  Airmen are expected to follow the process outlined in this Manual and become an active partner in their career development and management. 2.  Definition. 2.1.  Mentorship  is  a  type  of  professional  relationship  in  which  a  person  with  greater experience and wisdom guides another person to develop both personally and professionally.  This relationship helps achieve mission success and motivates Airmen to achieve their goals. 2.2.  Mentoring promotes a climate of inclusion that can help foster and develop the diverse strengths, perspectives, and capabilities of all Airmen.  Air Force capabilities and warfighting competencies  are  enhanced  by  diversity  among  its  personnel;  reference  Air  Force  Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-70, Diversity. 2.3.  Mentoring  in  the  Air  Force  is  voluntary  and  uses  formal  mentoring  combined  with informal mentoring to professionally develop Airmen based on the needs of the mentee. 3.  Guiding Principles. 3.1.  Mentoring  is  an  essential  ingredient  in  developing  well-rounded,  professional,  and competent future leaders.  The overall goal of mentoring is to help Airmen (civilian, enlisted, and officer) maximize their full potential (reference AFPD 36-26, Total Force Development and Management).  Mentors should focus on mentee development with a goal of giving the mentee the ability to manage their own development and learning. 3.1.1.  To effectively mentor Airmen and lift them to a higher level, mentors should have the ability to create positive interactions with mentees. 3.1.2.  Mentoring  is  meant  to  be  learning  focused  so  that  mentees  can  increase  their capacity to accomplish individual and professional goals. 3.2.  The Air Force fosters a mentoring culture by encouraging and expecting Airmen to be mentors  and  mentees.    This  culture  enhances  morale  and  discipline  and  improves  the operational environment while maintaining respect for authority. 3.3.  Mentoring is  an inherent responsibility of leadership.  Key to the mentoring process is the  direct  involvement  of  commanders,  directors,  and  supervisors  in  the  professional development  of  their  people  (reference  AFI  1-2,  Commander’s  Responsibilities).    They should  continually  challenge  their  Airmen  to  achieve  their  individual  and/or  professional goals.  4 AFMAN36-2643  4 MAY 2017 3.4.  Mentoring promotes professional development at every echelon and activity.  Mentoring is  an  ongoing  process  for  building  a  professional  relationship  that  fosters  communication concerning careers, competencies, behavior, and organizational missions.   Doctrine Volume II,  Leadership;  AFI  36-2909,  Professional  and  Unprofessional  Relationships;  AFI  36-703, Civilian  Conduct  and  Responsibility;  Strategic  Roadmap:    United  States  Air  Force Profession of Arms (Profession of Arms Center of Excellence/PACE website); and America’s Air  Force:    A  Profession  of  Arms  “The  Little  Blue  Book,”  (PACE  website)  set  forth guidelines regarding professionalism. 3.5.  Mentors and mentees should be aware of the Air Force definition of diversity, inclusion, and the benefits of a diverse and inclusive approach to leadership and mentorship (reference AFI 36-7001, Diversity). 3.6.  Airmen  have  the  option  of  selecting  or  being  paired  with  mentors  by  using MyVECTOR, Attachment 2, A2.2.1. 4.  Organizational Benefits. 4.1.  Professional  mentoring  helps  prepare  Airmen  for  increased  responsibilities  and  is  not designed to ensure the mentee is selected for a promotion. 4.2.  Some specific benefits are: 4.2.1.  Improved morale and unit cohesion. 4.2.2.  Enhanced professional and individual development. 4.2.3.  Increased  mastery  of  the  institutional  and  occupational  competencies  (reference AFMAN 36-2647, Institutional Competency Development and Management). 4.2.4.  Enhanced capacity to translate core values and strategies into productive actions. 4.2.5.  Greater engagement  and  retention  of Airmen with  the right  competencies needed in support of Air Force requirements. 5.  Organizational Goals. 5.1.  Create a positive environment promoting professional and individual growth through the Air  Force  Continuum  of  Learning  (CoL)  to  enhance  institutional  and  occupational competencies (Doctrine Annex 1-1, Force Development). 5.2.  Expand familiarization with the organization’s mission through increased understanding of history, heritage, leadership expectations, and the political environment. 5.3.  Provide  a  catalyst  for  leaders  and  subordinates  to  leverage  tactical,  operational,  and strategic knowledge. 5.4.  Establish  lines  of  communication  to  enable  timely  information  sharing  and  assistance when needed. 6.  Mentor Guidelines. 6.1.  Mentors  are  advisors  and  guides  who  share  knowledge,  experiences,  and  advice  in helping mentees achieve their career goals. 6.2.  Airmen should be diligent in their role as mentors understanding the time requirement to ensure effective mentoring is ongoing. AFMAN36-2643  4 MAY 2017 5 6.3.  Effective mentoring creates a balanced relationship that focuses on the unique needs of the mentee. 6.4.  Mentors  assist  mentees  in  discovering  career  direction  by  providing  for  individual growth and maturity. 6.5.  Mentors  are  not  sponsors  and  generally  perform  the  following  distinct  roles  that  add value to the lives of Airmen: 6.5.1.  Mentors  serve  as  an  advisor  in  providing  specific  information  or  insight  for  a given situation based on experience and knowledge. 6.5.1.1.  Mentors  may  initiate  communication  with  mentees  and  help  mentees formulate  short-term  and  long-term  goals  that  will  become  part  of  the  roadmap  for career development. 6.5.1.2.  Mentors focus on bringing out the best in mentees without personal agendas and biases complicating the mentoring relationship.  Mentors ask many questions and spend time hearing the response of mentees to use in future career vectors. 6.5.1.3.  Mentors  are  available  for  their  mentees,  keep  an  open  mind,  balance listening  and  sharing,  act  as  a  bridge  for  referring  mentees  to  others  who  can  help, and provide constructive feedback. 6.5.1.4.  Mentors help mentees navigate the Air Force “corporate” landscape. 6.5.2.  Mentors  may  serve  as  coaches  if  they  possess  the  desired  technical  competence because coaching is task oriented. 6.5.2.1.  Coaches  help  mentees  by  recommending imparting skills and behaviors. training  opportunities  and 6.5.2.2.  Coaches  encourage  exploring  different  approaches  to  a  problem  and strategically assess progress by giving advice for effective technical change. 6.5.2.3.  Coaches are involved with mentees for a short period of time with just a few coaching sessions to help mentees achieve their objectives. 6.5.3.  Mentors serve as facilitators by identifying resources and opportunities for closing competency gaps that lead to career progression. 6.5.4.  Mentors  advocate  for  mentees  by  recommending  mentees  participate  in  high-visibility activities. 6.6.  Mentors support the Air Force mission by helping mentees recognize the importance of defined  and  attainable  individual  goals  and  assisting  them  in  developing  a  sense  of accountability in achieving their goals. 6.7.  Mentors  help  mentees  understand  the  value  of  continuous  self-development  to  them personally and to the Air Force.  They assist mentees in taking advantage of all opportunities to improve their competencies.  Reference Figure A2.1. Mentee Checklist.   6 AFMAN36-2643  4 MAY 2017 6.8.  Mentors  use  the  Mentoring  Toolkit  in  Attachment  2  and  other  mentoring  resources  to ensure  their  mentees  receive  every  benefit  the  mentoring  relationship  can  provide.    They assist  mentees  in  identifying  strengths  and  areas  for  improvement  and  encourage  them  to seek  guidance  from  other  mentors  who  can  provide  support  for  specific  mentoring  needs outside their expertise (reference Table A2.1. Mentoring Relationship Types). 6.9.  Mentors  ensure  their  Airmen  are  aware  of  mentoring  options  offered  within  their organization.    It  is  important  for  mentors  to  communicate  with  their  mentees,  even  if  they work  at  a  different  duty  location  or  in  a  different  career  field,  to  provide  mentees  an opportunity to participate in mentoring relationships. 6.10.  One  area  mentors  clearly  can  address  is  learning.    To  this  end,  mentors  should  be familiar  with  the  CoL  for  officers,  enlisted  members,  and  civilian  employees  in  order  to adequately  discuss  the  learning  opportunities  with  their  mentees.    Additional  topics mentoring can encompass are listed in paragraph 13. 6.11.  Mentors recommend developmental tools, such as MyVECTOR, for mentees to assess their  capabilities,  encourage  mentees  to  provide  assessment  results  to  assist  in  building mentoring  plans,  and  aid  mentees  in  reaching  their  goals.    These  web-based  tools  provide direction on how Air Force requirements may be met through education and training. 6.12.  Mentors  should  enhance  their  mentoring  skills  by  reviewing  the  mentoring  resources located in Attachment 2, A2.2, and resources on MyVECTOR. 6.13.  Mentors  should  not  manage  mentees  as  their  supervisors  or  do  mentees’  work  for them.    Mentors  should  be  engaged  in  the  mentor/mentee  relationship  without  being domineering. 6.14.  Mentors  should  endeavor  to  mentor  not  just  those  Airmen  who  come  from  the  same demographics as themselves. 7.  Mentor Expectations. 7.1.  Exemplify Air Force Core Values (reference Doctrine Volume II). 7.2.  Provide practical counsel by offering guidance, providing feedback, and acknowledging accomplishment. 7.3.  Support mentees’ career planning and goal setting by using a developmental plan, such as  the  Mentoring  Plan  (reference  Table  A2.2.),  to  capture  career  planning  requirements.  Mentors  should  also  refer  mentees  to  Career  Field  Managers  (CFMs)  for  discussion  of  the career path tools that have been developed for their occupations. 7.4.  Advise  mentees  to  cultivate  their  leadership  and  functional  capabilities  by  completing the  online  institutional  and  occupational  competency  assessments  as  discussed  in  Figure A2.1, Figure A2.2 (vital for identifying both strengths and areas for improvement). 7.5.  Share relevant knowledge, experience, and resources with mentees. 7.6.  Identify and help mentees resolve potential issues they face in development. 7.7.  Facilitate opportunities for mentees to gain new experiences and build skills.  AFMAN36-2643  4 MAY 2017 7 8.  Mentee Guidelines. 8.1.  Mentees should be actively involved in their personal education and development.  They are  to  develop  a  mentoring  plan  that  clearly  identifies  their  educational  and  professional goals as discussed in paragraph 13.4.2. 8.2.  Mentees  should  create  an  appropriate  environment  that  allows  for  professional development, appropriate mentoring discussions, and regular meetings as schedules permit. 8.3.  Mentees  should  work  with  their  mentors  in  creating  their  personal  plans.    The  plans should be challenging but within the mentees’ capabilities. 8.4.  Mentees  should  request  assistance  when  needed,  be  fully  engaged,  and  be  active listeners. 8.5.  Mentees  should  possess  a  learning  attitude,  be  open  to  feedback,  and  be  willing  to accept new challenges. 8.6.  Mentees  should  be  familiar  with  information  in  the  Mentoring  Toolkit,  Attachment  2, and MyVECTOR.  They should use the resources for further development. 9.  Mentee Expectations. 9.1.  Mentees  manage  the  mentoring  relationship  by  scheduling  the  sessions,  creating  an agenda,  executing  developmental  activities  suggested  by  mentors,  and  following  up  and briefing the mentors. 9.2.  Mentees  work  with  mentors  in  developing  a  career  roadmap  by  identifying  and clarifying current and future career goals. 9.3.  Mentees demonstrate commitment and are able to communicate needs and concerns. 9.4.  Mentees  gain  in-depth  understanding  of  the  mission,  goals,  and  structure  of  the  Air Force. 9.5.

Mentees leverage opportunities for career advancement. 9.8.  Mentees expand leadership abilities. 9.9.  Mentees are receptive to feedback. 10.  Finding A Mentor.  To find a mentor, Airmen should: 10.1.  Pursue more than one mentor at the same time based on goals/needs. 10.2.  Think about work-related personal and professional areas where they want to improve. 10.3.  Look  strategically  for  mentors  (alumni  associations,  professional  associations,  peer recommendations, etc.). 10.4.  Decide on expectations for mentors to help in enhancing developmental needs. 10.5.  Review resources on MyVECTOR and in this Manual.   8 AFMAN36-2643  4 MAY 2017 10.6.  Make  a  list  of  possible  mentors  according  to  personal  criteria  and  desires  for  the relationship.  These should be specific to the mentoring relationship. 10.7.  Network.  Communicate to others you're looking for a mentor. 10.8.  Use matching capability of MyVECTOR to be paired with a mentor. 10.9.  Use MyVECTOR to send email inviting individual to be a mentor. 10.10.  Use MyVECTOR to communicate with a mentor. 11.  Successful Mentoring Mindset and Relationships. 11.1.  Mentors  must  willingly  enter  a  mentoring  relationship  without  the  expectation  of receiving anything in return. 11.2.  Mentor  and  mentee  should  practice  active accountability. listening  and  maintain  mutual 11.3.  Mentor  and  mentee  should  develop  mutual  respect,  maintain  trust  and  honest expressions, and establish a collaborative partnership. 11.3.1.  Mentors  and  mentees  should  establish  boundaries  and  expectations  for  the professional mentoring relationship (reference A2.1. Mentoring Discussion Topics). 11.3.1.1.  Mentorship  discussions  should  be  kept  professional  and  care  should  be taken  to  ensure  they  do  not  cross  over  into  non-work  related  personal  advising  or counseling. 11.3.1.1.1.  This  should  not  preclude  discussion  of  matters  relating  to  work-life balance. 11.3.1.2.  Mentors  and  mentees  should  discuss  confidentiality  expectations.  Confidentiality in a mentoring relationship is critical to establishing trust.  They need to understand discussions between them are to remain confidential. 11.3.1.2.1.  This  confidentiality  does  not  extend  to  revelations  of  unlawful actions. 11.3.1.3.  Trust is built in a mentoring relationship by being open, honest, respectful, and accountable; aligning expectations; and having integrity. 11.3.2.  Mentor  and  mentee  should  discuss  and  agree  on  meeting  logistics  including meeting frequency, type, duration, and times (reference Table A2.2.) 11.4.  Mentee should possess a learning attitude, remain open to feedback, and have a desire to develop by investing time in the relationship. 11.5.  Critical  for  a  successful  mentoring  relationship  are  respect,  responsiveness,  and accountability. 11.6.  Positive relationships involve training of mentor and mentee. 11.7.  Effective feedback on the mentoring relationship should be provided by the mentor in communicating a clear purpose for the feedback.  AFMAN36-2643  4 MAY 2017 9 11.7.1.  Feedback  by  the  mentor  is  specific  by  providing  information  on  observed behavior and not on perceived attitudes or judgment.  Mentor should discuss aspects that are most important, ask questions to help the mentee find their own solutions and to take ownership, comment on strengths as well as areas for improvement. 11.7.2.  Before  providing  feedback,  consider  if  the  feedback  would  be  of  value  to  the mentee. 11.8.  Mentors  set  the  proper  climate  for  the  feedback  session,  plan  carefully  what  is  to  be communicated, set the appropriate context for the sessions, and allow mentees opportunities to  listen  and  respond.    Mentors  and  mentees  should  work  together  in  planning  steps  in  the mentoring relationship. 12.  Preparing A Mentoring Plan. 12.1.  Mentees should create a career development vision statement, which is a future state of achievement. 12.2.  Mentees should understand the different mentoring relationships, purpose of mentoring sessions, current personal and professional conditions and environment. 12.3.  Mentees and mentors should review web-based training resources on MyVECTOR. 12.4.  Mentees  formulate  solid  and  achievable  short-  and  long-term  goals  in  the  Mentoring Plan on MyVECTOR and are fully committed to achieving each goal. 12.5.  Goals should be realistic and bring a level of excitement. 12.6.  Mentees identify milestones for each goal to indicate achievement. 12.7.  Mentors provide feedback throughout the mentee’s goal achievement process. 12.8.  Mentors and mentees track progress, evaluate status of overall plan, and revise the plan as necessary. 13.  Mentoring Discussion Topics 13.1.  Professional  Development.    Every  Airman  benefits  by  being  a  self-directed,  life-long learner.  Air Force Professional development resources are abundant. 13.1.1.  Air  Force  Doctrine,  Operational  Capabilities,  History,  and  Heritage.    Mentors should  encourage  mentees  to  be  familiar  with  Air  Force  doctrine,  history  and  heritage; air,  space,  and  cyberspace  capabilities;  and  operational  warfighting  topics.    The  LeMay Center  for  Doctrine  Development  and  Education  and  PACE  have  many  valuable resources in this area. 13.1.2.  Air  Force  Core  Values.  Air  Force  Core  Values  include  Integrity  First,  Service Before  Self,  and  Excellence  In  All  We  Do.    Engage  in  discussion  on  how  personal  core values  align  with  Air  Force  Core  Values.    Applicable  references  include:    Doctrine Volume  II,  the  Strategic  Roadmap:    United  States  Air  Force  Profession  of  Arms;  and America’s Air Force:  A Profession of Arms “The Little Blue Book”.   10 AFMAN36-2643  4 MAY 2017 13.1.3.  Diversity  and  Inclusion.    Air  Force  professional  capabilities  and  war  fighting skills are enhanced by diversity among its personnel.  Airmen working in a diverse and inclusive  environment  learn  to  maximize  individual  strengths  and  combine  individual abilities  and  perspectives  for  better  performance  by  teams  and  the  organization.  Reference AFPD 36-70 and AFI 36-7001). 13.1.4.  Air  Force  Institutional  Competencies.    Institutional  competencies  are  the professional  building  blocks  to  develop  Air  Force  leaders  across  all  occupations  and organizational  levels.    Institutional  competency  assessment  identifies  professional leadership strengths and areas for improvement.  Applicable references include: Doctrine Volume II, Doctrine Annex 1-1, AFPD 36-26, AFMAN 36-2647, and information on the Force Development link of the Air Force Portal. 13.2.  Professional Reading. 13.2.1.  Air Force Topics.  The CSAF Professional Reading List, Air University, and Air Force  Institute  of  Technology  are  all  good  sources  for  professional  readings.    The  Air Force Portal offers access to all these plus more. 13.2.2.  Leadership,  management,  and  business  topics.    A  mentoring  session  is  a  good time to discuss authors, leaders, and speakers who have had a positive influence on your career or life.  The Air Force Portal offers access to the AF e-Learning collection, which includes  books,  videos,  and  courses  as  well  as  other  no-cost  learning  opportunities.  Another  great  resource  is  the  virtual  Development  Resource  Center  available  to  all  Air Force members. 13.3.  Functional Development. 13.3.1.  Occupational  Competencies.    Occupational  competencies  are  specific  to  career field  duties  that  focus  on  building  depth  of  functional  experience  and  specific  technical areas of expertise that enable individuals to successfully perform their unique duties. 13.3.2.  Occupational  competency  assessment improvement. identifies  strengths  and  areas  for 13.4.  Career Planning. 13.4.1.  Aspiration.    It  is  important  for  mentors  to  distinguish  between  individual  goals, career  aspirations,  and  realistic  expectations.    Each  Airman  defines  a  successful  career differently,  and  there  are  numerous  paths  to  meet  individual  career  and  success  goals.  Foremost, however, individuals should focus on AF strategic needs.  Air Force leadership develops  members  who  are  skilled  in  the  employment  and  support  of  air,  space,  and cyberspace power and how they meet the security needs of the Nation. 13.4.2.  Mentoring Plan.  In discussing the Mentoring Plan, mentors should pay particular attention to assignment and job levels as mentees move from junior grade to mid-grade to senior  grade.    Applicable  resources  include  the  Air  Force  Continuum  of  Learning (officer,  enlisted,  and  civilian)  found  on  the  Force  Development  link  of  the  Air  Force Portal.    Mentors  of  enlisted  personnel  refer  to  the  Career  Field  Education  and  Training Plan  (CFETP)  in  the  training  record  and  AFI  36-2618,  The  Enlisted  Force  Structure.  Mentors  of  civilian  personnel  may  refer  to  AFI  36-401,  Employee  Training  and AFMAN36-2643  4 MAY 2017 11 Development,  and  AFMAN  36-606,  Civilian  Career  Field  Management  and Development. 13.4.3.  The Airman Handbook 1, AFH 1.  Information in the AF Handbook 1 (located on the  PACE  website)  should  be  discussed  with  enlisted  members  for  career  development and  promotional  opportunities.    This  information  is  based  on  knowledge  requirements from the Military Knowledge and Testing System. 13.4.4.  Development  Teams  (DTs).    DTs  provide  assignment  vectors  that  enhance professional development while meeting Air Force needs, without necessarily keying on a  specific  position  or  location.    When  mentees  become  eligible  for  DT  vectoring,  they should address career goals with their mentors.  Applicable reference include: AFPD 36-26; AFI 36-2110, Assignments; and AFI 36-2640. 13.4.5.  Promotion.  Mentors should understand the promotion systems for their mentees. Applicable references for Airmen include: 13.4.5.1.  AFPD  36-25,  Military  Promotion  and  Demotion,  explains  the  promotion system for officers, enlisted, and support components. 13.4.5.2.
