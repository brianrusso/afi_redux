This  publication  describes  policy  and  procedures  for  the  Depot  Source  of  Repair (DSOR) process.  DSOR process is broken into two sub-processes that provide definition to the  materiel  sustainment  process  for  depot-level  maintenance.  The  sub-processes  are  the Source  of  Repair  Assignment  (SORA)  and  Depot  Maintenance  Inter-Service  (DMI).  Supporting  DSOR  activities  include  DSOR  Periodic  Review  (PR),  Depot  Activation  (DA), Workload  Approval  Document  (WAD)  and  if  applicable,  Depot  Maintenance  Interservice Support Agreement (DMISA), as shown in Figure 1.1 below. Figure 1.1.  DSOR Overview.  1.1.2.  Depot  Source  of  Repair.    AFI  63-101/20-101  requires  all  systems  with  depot-level maintenance, determined through Level of Repair Analysis (LORA) or equivalent data, have approved  DSOR  decision(s)  by  Milestone  (MS)-B  (or  MS-C  if  there  is  no  MS-B).    The DSOR  process  applies  to  all  depot-level  maintenance  (hardware  and  software)  for  new acquisitions  and  fielded  systems  (including  the  unique  AF  portion  of  joint  programs  not covered  in  a  Joint  DoD  DSOR  decision).    As  defined  by  Title  10  US  Code  (USC)  Section §2460, depot-level maintenance or repair is  the overhaul,  upgrading, or rebuilding of parts, assemblies,  or  subassemblies,  and  the  testing  and  reclamation  of  equipment  as  necessary, regardless  of the source  of funds for the maintenance or repair or the location at  which the maintenance  or  repair  is  performed.    Depot-level  maintenance  is  an  activity  and  is  not location specific so it may be performed at organic and contract locations. AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 5 1.1.3.  The  DSOR  process  provides  a  structured  approach  for  making  and  implementing depot  maintenance  support  decisions.  The  DSOR  process  informs  contract  methodologies, supply chain management constructs, Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), and other aspects of product support management.  The SORA includes a recommended location for performing depot maintenance and a Core Logistics Analysis (CLA) with a percentage of the workload to be organic. 1.1.4.  The  DSOR  has  two-parts.    Part  I  is  the  SORA  which  includes  the  CLA,  Candidate Depot  (CD)  assignment  using  the  Technology  Repair  Center  (TRC)  construct,  a  workload analysis,  and  a  statutory  compliance  impact  assessment  (addressing  10  USC  §2464,  Core Logistics  Capabilities,  and  10  USC  §2466,  Limitations  on  the  Performance  of  Depot-level Maintenance  of  Materiel).    Part  II  is  the  DMI  review  which  identifies  existing  capabilities within  the  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  to  reduce  duplication  or  justify  additional capabilities.  Work will be assigned to other services only if the capability already exists in that  Service  and  no  similar  capability  exists  within  the  AF  sustainment  community.  If  the new  capability  exceeds  peacetime  requirements,  additional  capabilities  can  be  justified through  the  DSOR  process.    The  results  of  the  DSOR  process  are  documented  in  a  DSOR Decision Memorandum IAW Chapter 3 of this Manual. 1.1.5.  DSOR  Periodic  Review  (PR).    The  DSOR  PR  is  the  process  used  to  periodically review DSOR decisions for continuing validity.  The PR will be performed IAW Chapter 4 of this Manual. 1.1.6.  Depot  Activation (DA).  The DA process  implements  DSOR decisions in  support of statutory  depot  maintenance  requirements,  and  it  also  establishes  depot-repair  capability  in either public or private sectors to meet warfighter requirements. 1.1.7.  Depot Maintenance Interservice Support Agreements.  DMISAs define the agreement between  the  Air  Force  and  other  DoD  entities  to  provide  depot  maintenance  and  related support  functions  for  weapon  systems,  equipment  end  items,  systems,  sub-systems, components,  or  commodity  groups  (to  include  software  maintenance).    DMISAS  are  the required method to implement DSOR decisions between the AF Force and other DoD entities unless a Non-consumable Item Materiel Support Code 5 is utilized. 1.2.  DSOR Automated Management System (AMS). 1.2.1.  The  DSOR  AMS  is  the  authoritative  source  for  all  DSOR  activities  and  assists  the Product  Support  Manager (PSM) in  completion of the associated processes including depot activations,  periodic  reviews,  workload  approval  documents,  and  depot  maintenance  inter-service  agreements.  The  DSOR  AMS  is  an  automated  tool  that  provides  both  the  steps  for each  process  and  a  repository  for  the  historical  documentation  of  the  DSOR  process  by program.    The  tool  is  located  at:  https://usaf.deps.mil/DSOR/prod/1  with  templates available  under  DSOR  Library.    Note:    Classified  program  DSORs  are  jointly  developed between AFMC/A4 and AFMC/A5/8/9 in an appropriate secure environment. 6 AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Introduction. 3.1.1.  The DSOR process postures depot-level maintenance workloads based upon the TRC construct,  including  activation  of  prioritized  workloads.    The  DSOR  ensures  a  life  cycle perspective is utilized when planning and programming for depot-level maintenance, ensures compliance with statutory and regulatory guidance, and provides an audit trail for the life of the system.  A DSOR decision is required before investment dollars are obligated to establish a depot-level capability at a specific site (e.g., facilities, support equipment). Funds may be obligated without a DSOR for non-site specific items. The CLA must be complete by MS-A, and the DSOR must be complete prior to MS-B (or MS-C if there is no MS-B).  The PSM will ensure the required depot-level maintenance repair intellectual property rights and data deliverable  elements,  required  for  DA,  are  included  in  all  contract  actions.    As  the authoritative  source  for  all  DSOR  activities,  the  DSOR  AMS  includes  all  process instructions, templates, and resulting documentation for the CLA, SORA, DMI, DA, PR, and DMISA activities. DSORs can be accomplished at multiple levels (e.g., System, Sub-System, LRU/SRU). If a DSOR is completed at a higher level than all lower sub-indenture depot level reparables,  then  all  depot  level  reparables  will  assume  the  same  DSOR  designation  unless specifically  identified  in  the  DSOR  Decision  Memorandum.  Detailed  DSOR  guidance  is provided Library https://usaf.deps.mil/DSOR/prod/1/SitePages/Home.aspx. DSOR II in the 3.2.  Technology Repair Center Construct. 3.2.1.  The AF uses the TRC construct  of grouped technology descriptions to  posture depot maintenance  workloads.    The  TRC  construct  applies  to  all  materiel  subject  to  depot maintenance, properly categorizing workloads in groups based on unique skills,  equipment, and  the  facilities  required  to  perform  depot-level  maintenance.    Adherence  to  the  TRC construct  applies  to  all  depot-level  maintenance.    For  software  workloads,  the  Software Decision  Tree  Analysis  (documented  in  the  DSOR  AMS)  will  be  utilized.    The  current version of the TRC construct, as well as the TRC/FSC tables are located in the DSOR AMS. 3.2.2.  The  TRC  table  may  help  determine  the  potential  AF  CD  based  on  the  technology description.    The  TRC/FSC  table  is  an  updated  listing  of  items  repaired,  or  planned  to  be repaired, at each depot. 3.2.3.  TRC designations/documents are updated on an as needed basis 3.3.  Waivers. 3.3.1.  There  are  no  waivers  for  the  DSOR  requirement,  however,  there  are  exclusions (reference Paragraph 3.8). 3.4.  Partnerships. 3.4.1.  The  PSM  must  obtain  the  DSOR  decision  prior  to  finalizing  a  PPP.    PPPs  are  one method  to  implement  DSOR  decision  and  are  employed  through  detailed  Implementation Agreements (IA).  PPP opportunities for depot  maintenance requirements are considered as AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 11 early  as  possible  within  the  life  cycle.    When  a  product  support  strategy  includes  depot maintenance  PPPs,  the  PSM  must  analyze  and  incorporate  the  following  elements  into  the DSOR  and  DMAWG  documentation:  structure,  costs,  benefits,  opportunities,  risks, investments,  resources,  constraints,  impacts  to  statutory  requirements,  and  the  best  use  of public and private sector capabilities. 3.5.  Warranties. 3.5.1.  Warranties do not replace the DSOR process, and are not to be considered a long-term depot maintenance strategy.  The PSM must obtain the DSOR decision before committing to a long-term, depot-level repair posture, including warranties or extended service contracts. 3.6.  DSOR Triggers. 3.6.1.  A DSOR is required for all depot-level maintenance, including but not limited to new acquisition, new work, modification installation, modification follow-on, overseas workload, and workload shifts. 3.6.2.  New  Acquisition.    A  new  acquisition  includes  any  system,  item,  component,  sub-system,  or  software  that  will  result  in  a  new  requirement  for  depot-level  maintenance.  DSORs for new acquisitions shall be on the total anticipated inventory to be acquired.  For new  acquisitions,  the  DSOR  requirements  shall  be  initiated  no  later  than  the  Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase and within sufficient time to obtain a DSOR decision for inclusion into the Acquisition Strategy. 3.6.3.  New  Work.    As  related  to  requiring  a  DSOR,  new  work  is  a  change  to  a  previously postured system, sub-system, end item, or component that will result in at least a 20% change to the depot maintenance workload hours or cost. 3.6.4.  Modification  Installation.    This  is  a  one-time  effort.    Modifications  are  installed  by government  personnel  either  in  a  depot  or  by  a  depot  field  team,  or  by  contractors  in  a contractor  facility  or  by  contract  field  teams,  or  by  any  combination  of  these  methods  of implementation.  This is not a long-term sustainment decision.  However, the DSOR must be accomplished  to  determine  the  Source  of  Repair  (SOR)  for  the  modification,  to  facilitate accurate reporting for Title 10 USC §2466, and ensure compliance with 10 USC §2460 for installation of modifications. 3.6.5.  Modification  Follow-on.    When  a  modification  introduces  one  or  more  of  these components  requiring  depot-level  maintenance,  it  is  necessary  to  complete  the  DSOR  to determine where the follow-on depot maintenance will be performed.  The DSOR applies to modifications (a change  to  form,  fit,  function, or integration) to existing  systems  for which the  depot-level  SOR  has  been  approved.  This  may  be  combined  with  the  modification installation DSOR. 3.6.6.  Overseas Workload.  DSORs are required for any SOR that involves the potential of depot-level  maintenance  by a source outside of the United States.  DSOR packages will be prepared and submitted in the same manner as new acquisition packages. 3.6.7.  Workload  Shift.    A  permanent  change  in  the  officially-designated  SOR  or  source  of modification.  A DSOR is required for a workload shift when there is a proposed change in the  SOR  that  results  in  one  of  the  following  types  of  SOR  shifts:    from  assigned  organic depot to another organic depot; from assigned organic depot to a contract; or from contract 12 AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 SOR  to  an  organic  depot.    Changes  from  one  contract  repair  source  to  another,  or consolidating several contract workloads, do not require a DSOR.  For a workload shift, the DSOR process must be used to ensure compliance with Title 10 USC 2469. 3.7.  Depot Maintenance Software Workloads. 3.7.1.  Software  maintenance  is  to  correct  faults  (corrective  maintenance)  after  IOC  of  a software product, improve software performance or other attributes (perfective maintenance), or  to  adapt  a  weapon  system  to  a  changed  environment  within  the  bounds  of  existing  top-level  system  specifications  (adaptive  maintenance).    The  software  maintenance  process includes  problem/change  identification  and  classification,  analysis,  design,  implementation, regression/system  testing,  acceptance  testing,  and  delivery.    Software  maintenance  is performed  on  military  materiel  (e.g.,  weapon  systems  and  their  components,  space  control systems  and  their  components,  Automated  Test  Equipment  (ATE)  and  Test  Program  Sets (TPS),  and  systems  integration  laboratories).    Depot-level  software  maintenance  does  not include maintenance of business data systems.  There are four types of software maintenance workloads requiring a DSOR. 3.7.2.  Operational  Software  (including  Operational  Flight  Programs,  Mission  Planning, Training Systems and Weapon System Simulators).  This software pertains to both airborne and  ground  weapon  systems.    Weapon  system’s  software  also  includes  programs  or applications that are not directly tied to a specific system such as mission planning software that  is  provided  for  the  management  of  the  battle  space.    Implementing  typical  operational software involves using one or more computers, controllers, sensors, and/or indicators, etc. to collect  data  related  to  the  weapon  system  environment,  and  provides  the  functionality  to perform the weapon system mission.  Software supporting space system ground segments is included in this section. DSOR Part 1 - SORA is required, and no DMI is necessary. 3.7.3.  Test  Software  (ATE/TPS).    ATE  software  is  the  operating  software  resident  in  test equipment.    TPS  software  tests  item  serviceability.    Test  software  includes  software associated  with  an  end  item  being  tested  (TPS  software)  and  the  software  residing  in  test equipment (ATE software).  This includes user equipment software supporting space system ground segments. DSOR Part 1 - SORA is required, and no DMI is necessary. 3.7.4.  Industrial  Plant  and  Equipment  Software.    This  software  includes  automated  depot operations equipment including robotic, cleaning/plating, and other industrial processes.  No DSOR is required for this type of software. 3.7.5.  Software  Modifications.  Modifications  include  software  changes,  upgrades,  tech refresh, and updates. Modifications include but are not limited to incorporation of additional, new or improved capability.  DSOR Part 1 – SORA is required only; no DMI necessary. 3.8.  Exclusions to the DSOR Process.  3.8.1.  The  PSM  verifies  a  specific  workload  meets  the  exclusion  criteria  and  provides data/justification to AF DSOR Executive Manager.  AF DSOR Executive Manager reviews the  information  and  generates  a  DSOR  non-applicability  memorandum  for  items  meeting criteria  below.    For  space  programs,  AFSPC  must  concur  with  all  requests  to  exclude workloads from the DSOR process.  Workloads meeting the exclusion criteria include: AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 13 3.8.2.  Workloads  generated  by  Industrial  Plant  Equipment  located  exclusively  within  the depot maintenance complex and funded through the industrial fund. 3.8.3.  Modifications to components that do not change the form, fit, function, or integration of the component modified and do not change the basic part number; only the version (dash number change); as long as the SOR of the end item does not change. 3.8.4.  Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs. 3.8.5.  United  States  Special  Operations  Command  (USSOCOM)  workloads  that  are  Major Force  Program  (MFP)-11  funded.    However,  all  sustainment  workloads  transferring  to  AF will require a DSOR at time of official transfer. 3.8.6.  Automated  Data  Processing  Equipment  workloads  that  are  not  for  national  security systems (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications). 3.8.7.  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  special  design  military  spares.    Examples  include,  but are not limited to, nuclear weapon trainers, nuclear weapons test and evaluation or handling equipment, and use control equipment. 3.8.8.  Medical Equipment.  Management and sustainment for medical materiel for peacetime and  wartime  support  is  established  under  the  Air  Force  Medical  Support  Agency  as prescribed in AFI 41-201, Managing Clinical Engineering Programs.  Examples of medical equipment  exclusions  include  field  intravenous  fluid  reconstitution  and  deployable  oxygen systems. 3.8.9.  TPS  software  when  the  cost,  capability,  and  hours  are  included  in  the  DSOR  for  its associated hardware (unit under test). 3.9.  Core Exclusion. 3.9.1.  Commercial  items  are  not  exempt  from  the  DSOR  process.    However,  workload applicability  to  the  Title  10  USC  §2464  Core  exclusion  clause  is  captured  and  approved during  the  SORA  process  via  Congressional  Notification  Core  Exclusion.  The  Core exclusion  does  not  alleviate  the  requirement  to  complete  the  DSOR.  The  template  format, instructions  and  process  for  submission  are  located  in  the  DSOR  AMS.      The  process  for Core exclusion is: 3.9.2.  PSM  completes  the  Congressional  Notification  Core  Exclusion  template  in  DSOR AMS. 3.9.3.  PSM obtains coordination from AF DSOR Executive Manager and AFSPC if a space system. 3.9.4.  PSM submits template to their PEO for coordination. 3.9.5.  PEO coordinates with SAF/AQ. 3.9.6.  SAF/AQ  processes  notification  documentation  to  OSD  for  submission  to  Congress.  The notification to Congress constitutes Core exclusion approval. 14 AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 3.10.  Space Programs. 3.10.1.  Space programs, systems, sub-systems, and end items are routed through AFSPC in DSOR  AMS  before  submitting  to  AF  DSOR  Executive  Manager.    Space  PSMs  utilize  the DSOR AMS for the DSOR process to include the PR, DA, and DMISA activities. 3.11.  Execution of the DSOR Process. 3.11.1.  The  DSOR  process  includes  (1)  SORA  and  (2)  DMI,  constituting  the  DSOR decision.  Additional DSOR activities include decision implementation and review activities (i.e.,  DAs,  PRs)  which  are  addressed  in  their  individual  chapters.  The  DSOR  addresses  all impacts to statutory compliance, including 10 USC §2464 and 10 USC §2466. 3.11.2.  SORA  Process.    The  PSM  initiates  the  SORA  process  by  requesting  a  CLA determination  using  the  DSOR  AMS.    PSM  provides  data,  prepared  at  the  appropriate system/sub-system-level  for  data  obtainment  and  execution,  in  the  following  areas:  System Capability,  Functional  Description  of  System/Sub-system,  Final  Application,  Technology Assessment,  Cryptologic  Description,  Workload  Description,  Acquisition  Category,  and Joint  Service  Program  information.    For  new  acquisition  programs,  the  PSM  may  use  data based  on  similar  existing  systems/sub-systems.    AF  DSOR  Executive  Manger  performs  the CLA  and  assigns  a  Candidate  Depot  based  upon  the  TRC  construct.    AF  DSOR  Executive Manger issues a Core /Candidate Depot (CCD) Memorandum, including organic depot POCs and Core shortfall data, to the PSM.  CLA determination is required by MS-A IAW 10 USC §2366a and is included in the CLA Annex to the LCSP.3.11.3.  Upon receipt of the CLA and CCD memorandum, the PSM in collaboration with the candidate  organic  depot(s),  completes  the  SORA  templates  including  rationale  for  DSOR recommendations (reference  Figure 3.1).  The rationale includes projected depot peacetime repair  hours,  estimated  recurring  and  non-recurring  repair  costs,  depot  support  equipment, facilities information,  and a cost comparison between organic and  contract  SORs.   Organic and  contract  depot  repair  data  can  be  extracted  from  existing  analysis  or,  if  such  analysis does not  exist, then the SORA Cost Analysis Tool (CAT) template in  DSOR AMS may be used for the cost comparison. 3.11.4.  The PSM submits the completed SORA recommendations for approval coordination via  the  DSOR  AMS.    AF  DSOR  Executive  Manger  conducts  analysis  on  AF  statutory compliance  impacts  from  DSOR  recommendation  and  resolves  all  issues  with  the recommendation prior to issuing the SORA approval memorandum to the PSM. AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 15 Figure 3.1.  SORA Approval Process. 3.12.  DMI Process. 3.12.1.  The  PSM  submits  the  completed  DMI  templates  in  DSOR  AMS  (reference  Figure 3.2).  Subsequently, AF DSOR Executive Manager forwards the DMI packages to the other Services for identification of existing capability and capacity.  Work will be assigned to other Services  only  if  the  capability  already  exists,  no  similar  capability  exists  within  the  AF sustainment community, and when the recurring cost of sustainment is less than the AF.  If there is no existing or similar capability identified by the other Services within 45 days from the  DMI  request  issuance,  the  AF  shall  complete  and  issue  the  DSOR  Decision Memorandum. 3.12.2.  Upon receiving the Services’ input on the DMI, AF DSOR Executive Manager issues the  DSOR  Decision  Memorandum  for  each  DSOR  to  the  PSM  and  all  appropriate stakeholders.  This issuance completes the DSOR process. 3.12.3.  If  the  Service’s  reply  identifies  existing  capability,  AF  DSOR  Executive  Manger forms and leads an inter-service cost study team including the PSM, AF depot, and the other Service-nominated  SOR(s).    The  team  will  assess  the  nominated  SOR  capabilities  and  if equal  will  determine  the  best  value,  using  the  content  and  format  described  within Department  of  Defense  Manual  (DoDM)  4151.23,  DoD  Organic  Depot  Maintenance  Cost Comparability.    If  analysis  results  in  a  tie,  the  AF  depot  will  be  awarded  the  workload.  Based  upon  the  assessment  rationale,  AF  DSOR  Executive  Manger  issues  the  DSOR Decision  Memorandum  to  the  PSM  and  all  appropriate  stakeholders.    This  issuance completes the DSOR process. 16 AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 Figure 3.2.  DMI Review. AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 17 Chapter 4 DEPOT SOURCE OF REPAIR PERIODIC REVIEW 4.1.  Periodic Review Overview. 4.1.1.  DSOR  PRs  are  required  to  ensure  the  continued  validity  of  DSOR  decisions  and  to assess  if  an  updated  DSOR  decision  is  required  to  enable  more  affordable  or  effective support  for  a  program.    DSOR  PRs  are  conducted  throughout  the  life  cycle  of  a  weapon system/program.   Detailed  PR  process  is  contained  in  the  AMS  DSOR  Library https://usaf.deps.mil/DSOR/prod/1/SitePages/Home.aspx.  The  AF  DSOR  Executive Manager,  AFSPC/CC  (for  space  systems)  or  PEO  may  direct  a  PR  at  any  time;  however, PSMs are required to initiate PRs at the following times: 4.1.2.  Critical Design Review (CDR) + 90 days 4.1.3.  MS-C Decision 4.1.4.  Full Rate Production/Full Deployment Decision 4.1.5.  Every 5 years after issuance of the Final DSOR Decision Memorandum 4.2.  Periodic Review Execution. 4.2.1.  When executing a DSOR PR, the PSM: 4.2.1.1.  Determines  if  the  workload  has  changed  by  at  least  20%,  either  in  cost  or  in labor hours, as compared to the data used when making the most recent DSOR decision. 4.2.1.2.  Determines  if  additional  capabilities  or  sustainment  requirements  have  been added since the original DSOR decision. 4.2.2.  Enters the DSOR PR data in the DSOR AMS and execute direction accordingly. 4.3.  Periodic Review Approval. 4.3.1.  The AF DSOR Executive Manager approves the DSOR PR recommendation and may require the PSM to initiate a new DSOR.  The approval process is as follows: 4.3.2.  The AF DSOR Executive Manager evaluates the recommendation to determine if any changes  (size,  workload,  cost,  performance,  etc.)  occurring  since  the  initial/last  DSOR Decision warrant  a new  DSOR.  The AF  DSOR Executive Manager  reviews these changes with AFSPC/A4 prior to approval as applicable. 4.3.3.  If  the  program  has  changed  workload  or  cost  by  at  least  20%  or  incorporated  new capabilities, the AF DSOR Executive Manager will direct the PSM to initiate a new DSOR via DSOR AMS, within 30 days. The DSOR will follow the process described in Chapter 3. 18 AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 Chapter 5 DEPOT ACTIVATION (DA) 5.1.  Introduction. 5.1.1.  DA  process  identifies  and  assembles  all  required  facilities,  equipment,  materials, processes,  technologies,  training,  and  certified  personnel  to  perform  depot  maintenance  for weapon  systems  and  military  equipment.    DA  planning  begins  during  DSOR  development and ends when all depot maintenance capability is available for use (reference  Figure 5.1).  PSM uses the DA process to execute the DSOR decision, regardless of the outcome, and to inform  Request  for  Proposal  (RFP)  development  for  either  contract  depot  maintenance  or enlisting  Original  Equipment  Manufacturer  (OEM)  assistance  for  organic  depot  activation.  The detailed process to follow for DA can be found in DSOR Library located on the DSOR AMS https://usaf.deps.mil/DSOR/prod/1/SitePages/Home.aspx. Figure 5.1.  Depot Activation (DA) in the Acquisition Cycle. 5.1.2.  Funding.  The PSM plans and programs sufficient funding to support DA and includes all  associated  costs  in  program  life  cycle  cost  estimates.  PSMs  ensure  depot  funding requirements  are  included  in  CCaRs  in  order  to  enable  oversight  of  the  obligation  and execution of DA funding.  The Lead Command will be the DA funding advocate as detailed in  AFI  63-101/20-101.    For  additional  detail  on  funding  DA,  refer  to  DoD  7000.14-r, Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation, Volume 2A, Chapter 1, and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, paragraph 8.1.1.12. AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 19 5.1.3.  Schedule.    The  PSM  will  ensure  that  a  depot  activation  schedule  is  developed  and published, along with the Depot Maintenance Activation Plan (DMAP), in the DSOR AMS.  The PSM ensures that the AF DSOR Executive Manager is notified immediately if the depot activation  falls  behind  schedule.    The  notification  includes  appropriate  rationale  if  special circumstances are identified during system acquisition and/or deployment to warrant delay in activation.  The PSM ensures the DA funding requirements are modified to support the new schedule and updates the IMS, DMAP and DA reporting tabs in the DSOR AMS, in addition to updating CCaRs appropriately. 5.1.4.  Common  Reparable  Item  (CRI).    CRI  depot  repair  capabilities  will  be  explored  and documented throughout the logistics life cycle.  DA activities, to include repair capabilities, will be consolidated to the fullest extent possible to provide best value to the government. 5.1.4.1.  The  PSM  will  review  deliverables  received  under  DI-PSSS-81970  with DMAWG members and develop DA consolidation recommendations where possible. 5.2.  DA Process for DSORs with Organic Designated Workloads. 5.2.1.  The PSM develops a DMAP, which includes at least the depot maintenance activities and  the  deliverables  incorporated  into  all  contract  actions.    PSM  will  integrate  CDRLs required for statutory and regulatory reporting requirements, monitor all progress until depot-level repair capabilities are available, and resolve any impacts to the production line(s). 5.3.  Depot  Maintenance  Activation  Working  Groups  (DMAWGs)  and  Maintenance Activation Planning Teams (MAPTs). 5.3.1.  The PSM develops and submits a DMAP using DSOR AMS to AF DSOR Executive Manager for approval, IAW the Final DSOR Decision Memorandum. 5.3.1.1.  The PSM populates the DAPM located in DSOR AMS with DSOR data and AF DSOR Executive Manager runs an initial  set  of DAPM results to  help  focus the PSM’s DMAWG/DA resource utilization. 5.3.1.2.  The PSM revises the DA plan and funding requirements based upon the DAPM results and initiates DMAWG activities. 5.3.2.  The  PSM  establishes  a  DMAWG  to  facilitate  implementation  of  DA  requirements, facilitate  involvement  from  all  stakeholders,  and  ensure  timely  activation  of  depot  repair capability.  The PSM and a representative from AFMC co-chair the DMAWG. 5.3.2.1.  The PSM initiates the DMAWG no later than 90 days after receiving the Final DSOR  Decision  Memorandum  and  continues  the  DMAWG  until  all  repair  capabilities are available for use. 5.3.2.2.  AFMC ensures that SMEs are assigned to support the DMAWG and subordinate MAPTs. 5.3.3.  The  DMAWG  is  supported  by  MAPTs.    MAPTs  are  subgroups  with  SMEs  from  all applicable Integrated Product Support Element disciplines. 5.3.3.1.  A  single  MAPT  is  assigned  to  support  implementation  of  specific  DSOR decision(s). 20 AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 5.3.3.2.  MAPTs  develop  and  brief  detailed  DA  plans  to  DMAWG  for  DMAP  input.  DMAWG co-chairs will determine if the plan is ready and route for PSM approval. 5.4.  DA Process for DSORs with Organic Designated Workloads. 5.4.1.  The DMAWG develops a Charter no later than 90 days post initial DMAWG. 5.4.1.1.  At  a  minimum,  the  Charter  must  address  the  DA  objective,  membership  roles and responsibilities, MAPTs structure, team duration, references, and meeting cadence. 5.4.1.2.  The DMAWG co-chairs approve the Charter and load it into DSOR AMS. 5.4.1.3.  The DA tabs in DSOR AMS will be updated during each DMAWG meeting to reflect current status. 5.4.2.  The DMAWG develops a DMAP no later than 90 days after initial DMAWG meeting.  DMAP  will  serve  as  a  living  document  to  be  updated  as  a  function  of  the  DMAWG activities.  All updates to the DMAP must be maintained on the DSOR AMS. 5.4.2.1.  The  DMAP  addresses  all  Integrated  Product  Support  Element  planning  factors and  describes  DA  events,  resources,  and  schedules  to  implement  all  DSOR  decisions within DMAWG portfolio. 5.4.2.2.  The  DMAP  is  a  living  document  and  as  such  the  PSM  continually  updates  as significant programmatic, engineering, and/or funding changes occur. 5.4.3.  MAPT develops a detailed roadmap for implementation of specific DSOR decisions.  The roadmap includes the results of depot capability gap analysis.  This gap analysis, which is  funded  by  the  PSM,  evaluates  current  depot  capabilities  including  recurring  and  non-recurring  DA  requirements  and  processes  associated  with  all  applicable  Integrated  Product Support  Elements procedures, validation/verification  procedures,  quality  assurance).    The  analysis  forms  a  basis  for  a recommended  DA  action  plan  with  required  resources,  cost  and  timelines.    MAPT  Leads provide the final recommendation to DMAWG and executes as directed by the PSM. support supply (e.g., repair process flow, 5.4.4.  The  PSM  updates  DAPM  with  detailed  DA  data,  and  the  AF  DSOR  Executive Manager  provides  priority  adjustments  per  DAPM  execution.    The  PSM  will  make  all required adjustments to the funding profile or DMAP. 5.4.5.  AFMC  ensures  the  completion  of  the  DA  process  is  documented  by  receiving  an Organic Depot Capability Memorandum from the PSM.  The PSM will upload the Organic Depot Capability Memorandum into DSOR AMS. 5.4.6.

The WAD is the process for documenting approval of a short term shift of work from the organic repair depot to another organic facility or to contract support. 6.1.2.  Workloads  include  interim  contract  support  (ICS),  interim  organic  support,  organic workload  performed  by  Depot  On-site  Contract  Augmentee  Teams  (DOCAT),  and  depot-level  maintenance  workloads  funded  by  Bridge,  Contingency,  or  Emergency  contracts.  WAD approval is required to ensure statutory compliance. 6.1.3.  Short term is not to exceed one year without approval of AFMC/CC. The AF DSOR Executive  Manager  includes  all  approved  WAD  dollar  amounts  in  the  AF  10  USC  §2466 report. 6.1.4.  The  WAD  guidance,  template,  and  approval  process  is  provided  in  the  DSOR  II Library at https://usaf.deps.mil/DSOR/prod/1/SitePages/Home.aspx. 22 AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 Chapter 7 DEPOT MAINTENANCE INTERSERVICE SUPPORT AGREEMENTS 7.1.  Applicability. 7.1.1.  Applies  to  all  Air  Force  DMISAs,  regardless  of  the  method  by  which  the  DSOR decision  was  reached  (e.g.,  DMI  study  or  Directed  DSOR).    Note:  Inter-Service  Depot maintenance  workload  not  accomplished  under  the  credit  exchange  process  will  be  via  a DMISA. 7.2.  Scope of DMISAs. 7.2.1.  DMISAs  are  established  to  document  the  requirements  of  depot  maintenance  and related  support  functions  for  weapon  systems,  equipment  end  items,  systems,  subsystems, components,  or  commodity  groups  (to  include  software  maintenance).    DMISAs  are normally  used  between  the  Military  Services;  however,  they  may  also  be  used  between  a Military  Service  and  another  DoD  Component  or  Federal  Agency  receiving  organic  depot maintenance support. 7.2.2.  DMISAs are only used to assign workload and shall not be used to document transfer of  responsibility  for  a  function  or  mission  from  one  Military  Service  or  DoD  Agency  to another.   All DMISAs will have an expiration not to exceed 9 years from the date they are signed. 7.2.3.  Detailed DMISA guidance, templates and policy is provided in the DSOR II Library at https://usaf.deps.mil/DSOR/prod/1/SitePages/Home.aspx. 7.2.4.

Candidate Depot—The AF prospective or “candidate” organic depot being considered for long-term,  depot-level  repair  of a system/sub-system/end item.   It  is  not  a final  depot  selection until the DSOR process is complete.  The TRC construct is used to select AF “candidate” depots. Core—Refers  to  Title  10  USC  §2464,  which  states  the  DoD  must  maintain  a  Core  logistics capability that is government-owned and government-operated (including government personnel and government-owned and operated equipment and facilities) to ensure a ready and controlled source of technical competence and resources necessary to ensure effective and timely response to mobilization, national defense contingency situations, and other emergency requirements. Core  Capability—An integral part of a depot  maintenance skill and resource base that will be maintained  within  depot  activities  to  meet  contingency  requirements.    Core  comprises  a minimum level of mission-essential capability within DoD. Depot  Level  Maintenance—Materiel maintenance or repair requiring the inspection, overhaul, upgrading, or rebuilding of parts, assemblies, or subassemblies, and the testing and reclamation of equipment as necessary, regardless of the source of funds for the maintenance or repair or the location at  which the maintenance or  repair is  performed.   The term includes (1) all aspects  of software maintenance classified by the Department of Defense as of July 1, 1995, as depot-level maintenance and repair, and (2) interim contractor support or contractor logistics support (or any similar  contractor  support),  to  the  extent  that  such  support  is  for  the  performance  of  services described  in  the  preceding  sentence.    The  term  does  not  include  the  procurement  of  major modifications or upgrades of weapon systems that are designed to improve program performance or the nuclear refueling or defueling of an aircraft carrier and any concurrent complex overhaul.  A major upgrade program covered by this exception could continue to be performed by private or  public  sector  activities.    The  term  also  does  not  include  the  procurement  of  parts  for  safety modifications.  However, the term does include the installation of parts for that purpose. Depot Maintenance Activation Plan—A plan, developed by the PSM, showing the events and schedules required to achieve a depot maintenance capability for specified systems, equipment, and  resources.    This  plan  will  consider  organic,  inter-service,  and  contractor  support requirements IAW with DSOR decision. Depot  Maintenance  Activation  Working  Group—A  group  of  representatives  from  the stakeholders  involved  in  activating  a  depot  maintenance  capability  for  individual  systems  and equipment. Depot  Maintenance  Interservice—The  interservice  process  to  select  site  specific  depots  to perform  maintenance  support.    Reviews  are  accomplished  by  a  Joint  Service  forum  to  ensure consideration of all Services' depot capabilities. AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 27 Depot Maintenance Interservice Support Agreement—A formalized agreement whereby one Service/Agency  (the  Agent)  obligates  itself  to  provide  depot  maintenance  support  for  another Service/Agency (the Principal).  DMISAs may be used when a Military Service is the Agent, and another Federal Government department or agency, or element thereof, is the Principal. Depot  Source  of  Repair—The  authorized  organic,  contract,  or  combination  of  organic  and contract activity(s) or facility(s) that performs, or is planned to perform, depot-level repair on a system/sub-system/end item. End  Item—Final  combination  of  systems,  sub-systems,  components,  parts,  and  other  materiel ready for its intended use. Fit—Involves the manner in which an asset physically attaches to, or integrates with, an adjacent component or higher level assembly.  For hardware assets, fit involves such things as mechanical and electrical attachment points and methods (e.g., connectors, mounting trays, equipment racks, etc.).    For  firmware  and  software  assets,  fit  involves  the  manner  in  which  computer  code  is installed into its host platform, system, or sub-system. Form—Involves  the  physical  properties  and  manufacturing  characteristics  of  an  asset.    For hardware  assets,  form  includes  size,  shape,  weight,  and  appearance,  as  well  as  materiel properties,  treatments,  finishes,  and  production  tolerances.    For  firmware  and  software  assets, form includes items such as computer language and the media that the application is hosted on. Function—Involves  the  manner  in  which  the  asset  operates,  performs  an  intended  action,  or provides a designated capability. Integrated  Process  Team—A  multi-disciplinary  group  of  individuals,  who  are  collectively responsible  for  delivering  a  defined  process.    The  team  is  composed  of  personnel  who  plan, execute,  and  implement  life  cycle  decisions  for  the  system  being  acquired.    It  includes empowered  representatives  (stakeholders)  from  all  of  the  functional  areas  involved  with  the process (i.e., design, manufacturing, test and evaluation, logistics personnel, and especially, the customer).   Because the  activities relative to  a system’s acquisition change and evolve over its life cycle, the roles of various process teams and its members evolve. Level  of  Repair  Analysis—A  prescribed  procedure  for  defense  logistics  planning.    It  is conducted to determine the best, most efficient and effective echelon to perform maintenance on systems/sub-systems/end items. Maintenance  Activation  Planning  Team—A  group  of  SMEs,  who  support  the  DMAWGs  in activating  organic  depots  for  new  workloads.    The  team  is  established  using  the  integrated product development philosophy. Modification—Change  to  the  form,  fit,  function,  or  interface  of  an  in-service  AF  hardware  or software configuration item. Modification  Follow-on—New  components  or  altered  components  that  will  require  long-term follow-on depot maintenance. Modification  Installation—The  act  of  installing  modifications  of  a  weapon  system,  item, component, system, or sub-system. New  Acquisition—Any  system,  sub-system,  component,  item,  or  software  that  will  result  in  a new requirement for depot-level maintenance. 28 AFMAN 63-122  30 MAY 2017 New  Work—As  related  to  requiring  a  DSOR,  new  work  is  a  change  to  a  previously  postured system, sub-system, end-item, or component that will result in a change greater than 20% to the depot maintenance workload hours or cost. Organic—Depot-level maintenance performed by a Military Department under military control utilizing  government-owned  or  government-controlled  facilities,  tools,  test  equipment,  spares, repair  parts,  and  military  or  civil  service  personnel  regardless  of  location  or  type  of  funds supporting  the  workload.    Depot-level  maintenance  support  by  one  Service  for  another  is considered organic within the DoD. Overseas Workload Program—DSORs are required for any SOR that involves the potential for accomplishment of depot-level maintenance by a source outside of the United States. Principal—The  military  service,  federal  department,  or  agency  receiving  depot-level maintenance support from an Agent. Product  Support  Manager—The  individual  responsible  for  managing  the  package  of  support functions required to field and maintain the readiness and operational capability of major weapon systems, sub-systems, and components. Program  Manager—The individual responsible for, and has authority to, accomplish program objectives for development, production, and sustainment in order to meet the user's operational needs.   Individual  is  also  accountable for credible cost,  schedule, and performance reporting  to the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA). Source  of  Repair  Assignment—An  iterative  process  used  to  address  AF  depot-level maintenance requirements and the locations to provide the maintenance.  The process complies with the requirements contained in Title 10 USC §2366a & b, §2464, and §2466, and applies to new acquisition and fielded systems.  It begins at program initiation with a determination of the requirement  for  Core  depot-level  maintenance  and  repair  capabilities,  and  the  identification  of candidate depot(s).  The process continues throughout the life cycle for sustainment planning and best value analysis.  It culminates with a sustainment strategy determination and applicable SOR locations.  The results are coordinated across the DoD Services and are documented as a DSOR.  The coordinated DSOR document is submitted to the acquisition office for action and inclusion in the LCSP. Sub-system—A  combination  of  equipment,  groups,  etc.,  performing  operational  functions within a system.  Sub-systems form the major subdivisions within a system. System—A functionally, physically, and/or behaviorally-related group of regularly interacting or interdependent elements, for which the group of elements form a unified whole. Technology  Maturation  and  Risk  Reduction—The  second  phase  of  the  Defense  Acquisition Management  framework  as  defined  and  established  by  DoDI  5000.02.    It  is  initiated  by  a successful  MS-A  decision,  and  its  purpose  is  to  reduce  technology  risk  and  to  determine  the appropriate  set  of  technologies  to  be  integrated  into  the  full  system.    This  effort  is  normally funded  only  for  advanced  development  work  and  does  not  mean  a  new  acquisition  program  is initiated. Workload  Shift—A  permanent  change  in  the  officially-designated  SOR  or  source  of modification,  and  can  only  be  accomplished  through  the  DSOR  process  when  such  change involves an organic depot.
