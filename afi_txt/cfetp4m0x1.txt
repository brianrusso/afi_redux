This CFETP provides information necessary for the AFCFM, MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct effective career field training program.  The CFETP is certified and managed by the AFCFM.  An annual review of the CFETP is conducted to ensure currency and accuracy.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  For our career field, this training is provided by Air Force Mobility Command through the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  Upgrade Training (UGT) identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for 3-, 5-, and 7-skill levels.  Qualification Training (QT) is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify and Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the UGT process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.   Advanced Training (AT) is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen.  Proficiency Training (PT) is additional training, either in-residence or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade training.  The CFETP also serves the following purposes:   1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  It is also used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career.   1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.   1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training and the training delivery method.   1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training program.   2.  Uses.  This plan will be used at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available and instituted for each individual in the specialty.  2.1.  USAFSAM training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, and field training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.   2.2.  MAJCOMs must ensure that no training is developed, when such training can be satisfied by existing courses.  The MFMs will ensure MAJCOM training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial skill, UGT, and proficiency requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident, or contract training courses.  2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.    3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  The AFCFM and MFMs will identify and coordinate through proper channels all initial subsequent changes to the CFETP.  The  8  AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

Skill and Career Progression. Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level plays an important role in the AF’s ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at the appropriate points in their career.  5.1.  Apprentice (3) Skill Level.  Initial skills training in this specialty consists of the tasks and knowledge training provided in the 3-skill level residence course located at Wright Patterson AFB, OH.  Individuals must complete the initial skills course to be awarded AFSC 4M031.  5.2.  Journeyman (5) Skill Level.  Upon arrival to their first duty station, individuals will be enrolled in 5-skill level Upgrade Training (UGT).  Individuals must complete the five volume mandatory Career Inspects and evaluates aerospace and operational physiology equipment and procedural activities.  10 Development Course (CDC) and applicable core tasks identified in the CFETP.  Award of the 5-skill level also requires completion of a minimum of 12 months in upgrade training (UGT) and individuals must be recommended by their supervisor and approved by their commander.  Individuals in retraining status, Training Status Code (TSC) ‘F’, are subject to the same training requirements and must complete a minimum of 9 months in upgrade training (UGT).  Note: Supervisors may identify and standardize local tasks for upgrade with the AFCFM approval.  5.2.1  As a 5-skill level, you may have the opportunity to work in one of the several different special functions of the Aerospace and Operational Physiology career field.  These special functions are:  5.2.2.  High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support (HAAMS):  This is normally an additional tasking assigned to specific units which involves flying on various aircraft platforms as a physiological observer for the aircrew, High Altitude Parachutists (HAP), and additional passengers.  In this capacity, you perform duties very similar to that performed as an inside observer on altitude chamber flights but with additional responsibility for monitoring and operating the specialized oxygen systems used for such missions.  Training for this mission consists of aircraft life-support training for the specific aircraft you will fly in and either hands-on training on specialized oxygen systems or formal training conducted by the manufacturer of such equipment.  Training for HAAMS is IAW AFI 11-409, High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support.  5.2.3.  High Altitude Reconnaissance Mission Support (HARMS):  This support mission will assign you to the Physiological Support Squadron (PSPTS), Beale AFB, CA.  Airmen are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of all USAF pressure suit assemblies.  This includes minor repair, pre/post-flight, periodic, annual, and overhaul inspections.  After a Full Pressure Suit Assembly (FPSA) is ready for flight, PSPTS technicians integrate the pilot into the FPSA, checking for correct inflation and leak parameters, and then integrate the pilot into a U-2 aircraft.  Other duties include parachute/survival kit upload/download into and out of the aircraft.  Specialized technicians are assigned to the oxygen equipment section where helmet regulators and suit controllers are maintained using altitude simulating test stands to ensure their utmost reliability.  Training for HARMS is IAW ACCI 11-459, High-Altitude Reconnaissance Mission Support Program.  5.2.4.  Research:  This includes participation in various research protocols conducted with volunteer subjects.  This may include centrifuge operations, high altitude protection research, cockpit and equipment integration, and thermal protection.    5.2.5.  Centrifuge:  This duty consists of a training program for aircrew who are either currently flying or are selected to fly sustained high-G aircraft (SHGA).  Academic topics include: the physiological effects of acceleration forces, characteristics of G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC), techniques of an effective Anti-G Straining Maneuver (AGSM), mishap lessons learned, and protection offered by anti-G systems.  Students will also complete centrifuge profiles prescribed by AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew.  5.2.6.  Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device (ROBD):  The ROBD is a training system that provides hypoxia recognition and emergency procedures training using normobaric reduced gas mixtures.  This system is designed to be used in conjunction with aircraft flight simulators or Hypoxia Familiarization Trainers (HFT) so that the MDS-specific oxygen systems emergency procedures are concurrent to that of the crewmembers aircraft.  The ROBD should be used for all refresher aircrew whose aircraft oxygen systems and emergency procedures are not adequately represented in the altitude chamber.  Examples include: CV-22, B-2, B-1, F-22A, and the F-35.  Operating instructions for aircrew training with this device is outlined in AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiology Training Program.   11 5.2.7.  United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine:  This special duty assignment allows selected individuals to perform instructor duties as technical training instructors “T” prefix position.  For selection to this job, the individual should possess an Associate degree or higher or be within one year of obtaining their degree.  Once selected technicians will attend Basic Instructor Course or Initial Instructor Methodology Course.  Duties performed are primarily supporting AFSC awarding courses such as the 4M031 apprentice course.  Craftsman (7) Skill Level.  In order to progress beyond the 5-skill level there are Professional 5.3. Military Education (PME) requirements that must be met.  Members must graduate Airman Leadership School (ALS) before being promoted to Staff Sergeant (SSgt).  ALS is approximately five weeks long and usually requires in-residence completion.  The curriculum is designed to develop a mindset and associated skills to meet four graduate attributes: (1) expeditionary Airmen, (2) supervisor of Airmen, (3) military professional, and (4) supervisory communicator.  ALS graduates earn 10 semester hours of college credit with CCAF.  5.3.1.  Once selected for promotion to SSgt, individuals must complete a minimum of 12 months in UGT and applicable mandatory core tasks identified in the CFETP.  Award of the 7-skill level also requires completion of an advanced distance learning course B6ACW4M071 0SAA (Craftsman course) which is managed by USAFSAM/FEPE, Physiology Education Branch, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  Individuals in retraining status (TSC “G”) are subject to the same training requirements and must complete a minimum of 6 months in UGT.  5.3.2.  Career progression beyond the SSgt rank consists primarily of increasing supervision and management responsibilities within the Aerospace and Operational Physiology flight while still performing many of the core tasks of a 5-skill level.  As a Technical Sergeant (TSgt), the member is most likely in charge of an element with supervisory responsibilities for two or more subsections.  Prior to promotion to Master Sergeant (MSgt), the member must complete an in-residence course at the Noncommissioned Officers Academy.  This six-week course emphasizes leadership training and human resource management that prepares the member to perform at the superintendent level.    5.3.3.  As a 7-skill level, you may have the opportunity to work in an additional special function of the Aerospace and Operational Physiology career field.  This special function is known as:  5.3.4.  Aerospace and Operational Physiology Team (AOPT):  Personnel stationed at Human Performance locations must have their 7-skill level and have a minimum of 4 years of experience in the career field.  Eager individuals at operational bases that possess their 5-skill level may provide assistance.  Due to diverse and unique wing missions, AOPT responsibilities may vary.  Those assigned to an AOPT may provide local life-support and wing safety consultation on theater specific human performance issues.  Additionally, they may also develop human performance related threat briefs specific to the theater of operation, based on local intelligence analysis, weather, and other operational/environmental conditions to increase mission effectiveness.  Personnel stationed at Human Performance locations that have completed all 7-skill level UGT requirements are not required to have/develop a MTP.    5.4.  Superintendent (9) Level.  Must be at least a Senior Master Sergeant (SMSgt) and be recommended by their supervisor and approved by their commander for award of the 9-skill level.  SMSgt selects will attend the Senior NCO Academy (SNCOA).  A SMSgt may have both the responsibility of Superintendent and the additional duty of MAJCOM Functional Manager.  5.4.1.   In order to be promoted to the grade of CMSgt, a SMSgt must have completed in resident SNCOA.  Once selected a CMSgt will attend the Chief Master Sergeant Orientation within their MAJCOMs.  No advanced technical training is required for the 9-skill level.  12  6.  Training Decisions.   The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Aerospace and Operational Physiology Specialty career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  This CFETP was revised and updated based on the outcome of the 17-21 March 2014 Occupational Survey Report and recommendations from the Air Force Career Field Manager and Subject Matter Expertise representatives.   6.1.  Initial Skills Training.  The initial skills course (Aerospace and Operational Physiology Apprentice Course) was revised to provide trainees with a broad spectrum of the career field and to meet new training requirements set by the 17-21 March 2014 U&TW.  There were minor changes to the STS to eliminate skills training redundancies to recapture training hours during the course.  6.2.  Five Level Upgrade Training Requirements.  Aerospace and Operational Physiology technicians must complete both CDC and OJT requirements as outlined in the CFETP.  6.3.  Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements.  The advanced skills course requirements provide trainees the skills and knowledge necessary to become a craftsman.  To obtain 7-skill level requirements, individual must have a minimum 12 months in upgrade training.  Following the 17-21 March 2014 U&TW, significant changes were made to the 7-skill level UGT requirements, to include the format of the STS.  Tasks listed under 7-skill level are now separated into two distinct columns: 7-skill level course and 7-skill level OJT.  This two column format was established to designate which tasks are fulfilled upon completion of the distance learning Craftsman course and which will require unit level OJT.  Additionally, proficiency codes for many tasks have been modified to align with the capabilities of a distance learning environment.

This section identifies known resource constraints which preclude optimal/desired training from being developed or conducted, including information such as cost and manpower.  Narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included.  Also included in this section are actions required, office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates.  Resource constraints will be, as a minimum, reviewed and updated annually.  12.  Reporting Job Proficiency Training Constraints - Units/MAJCOMS.   12.1.  Supervisors should report known resource constraints that prevent personnel from completing the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan, to their unit-level enlisted specialty training  manager.  The authority for requesting waivers is AFI 36-2101.   12.2.  In the report, provide a brief description of the resource constraints which adversely affect the training program and include the impact this constraint has or will have on training. Identify the  22 specific STS line item and task code(s) affected. Also, provide a brief description of the resource needs to resolve the problem, including expenses, the corrective actions taken or to be taken, and the estimated completion date.   12.3.  If the constraint may be resolved at the local level, the report will be coordinated with the senior 4M0X1, and if the impact affects unit war skill requirements, the group CC. If the constraint needs MAJCOM support, forward the report through your MDG/CC to the 4M0X1 MFM. Constraints that cannot be resolved at the unit or MAJCOM level, or have a long term estimated completion date, must be forwarded to the 4M0X1 AFCFM as a request for waiver or deferment of CFETP requirements.  13.  Apprentice Level Training Constraints.  Currently, apprentice level students are unable to complete parachute landing familiarization to include: hanging harness, lateral descent training, and parachute landing falls.  Because of this, students who are not able to complete the above items will be considered to have training deficiencies due to lack of equipment necessary for proper hands-on training.  A course resource estimate for equipment has been submitted and is awaiting approval.  If approved, a lateral descent trainer, to include a 2- and 4-foot platform will be constructed at Wright Patterson AFB, OH. (OPR: USAFSAM/OM with a targeted completion date of FY 17)    14.  Five Level Training Constraints.  There are currently no resource constraints at the 5-skill level.  15.  Seven Level Training Constraints.  There are currently no resource constraints at the 7-skill level.  Section E - Transitional Training Guide  There are currently no transitional training requirements.  This area is reserved.  PART II  Section A – Specialty Training Standard  1.  Implementation.  The STS provided by USAFSAM will be used for technical training starting 1 Oct 14.  Training documentation will be accomplished in the web-based AFTR, accessible from the AF Portal (via the Advanced Distributed Learning System link).    2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS includes:  2.1.  Column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference).  The most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-and 7-skill level.   2.2.  Column 2 (Core task/wartime task).  Identifies those tasks determined to be “Core Tasks” for both 5-, and 7-skill levels.  Wartime task requirements are identified by a (R).  Wartime task requirements apply to personnel assigned to Unit Type Code FFQBB and/or in HAAMS upgrade training.  Personnel in UGT to the 5-skill level must be trained and certified on all tasks with a “5”.  Personnel in UGT to the 7-skill level must be trained and certified on all tasks annotated with a “7”.    2.3.  Column 3 (Formal training and correspondence course requirements).  This area shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.  The Air Force Career Development  23 Academy AFCDA (AFCDA) listing may be accessed via SharePoint at    AFCDA.WAPS@MAXWELL.AF.MIL for current CDC volume content.  2.4.  Column 4 (Certification for OJT).  Is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use automated training management systems to document technician qualifications, if available.  Task certification must show a certification or completion date.  Note: (As a minimum for all core tasks, use the following column designators:  Training Complete, Trainee, Trainer Initials, and Certifier Initials.)  2.5.  Qualitative Requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and the CDCs.  2.6.  Job Qualification Standard.  The STS becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. "Go" means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct procedures. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  2.6.1.  Documentation of initial training.  Within AFTR ensure to complete the following:  Training Start, Training Complete, Trainee Initials, Trainer Initials, and Certifier Initials.   2.6.2.  Decertification and Recertification.  When a supervisor determines an Airman is disqualified on a task previously certified for their duty position, the supervisor deletes certification in AFTR.  Appropriate remarks pertaining to the reason for decertification are entered on the AF Form 623a, On-The-Job Training Record-Continuation Sheet.    2.6.3.  Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the “go” or “no go” level.  Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures.  2.7.  Specialty Training Standard.  Guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System.  Specialty Knowledge Tests are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by SNCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog.  3.  Recommendations.

Measurement.  Each proficiency code STS task or knowledge item taught in the technical school is measured through the use of an objective.  An objective is a written instruction for the student so he/she knows what is expected of him/her to successfully complete training on each task.  Each objective is composed of a condition, behavior, and standard which state what is expected of the student for each task.  The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (i.e. TOs, type of equipment, etc). The behavior is the observable portion of the objective (i.e. perform an operational check).  The standard is the level of performance that is measured to ensure the STS proficiency code level is attained.  Each objective uses a letter code to identify how it is measured.  All objectives use proficiency codes, which indicate a progress check is used to measure subject or task knowledge.  “W” indicates a comprehensive written test and is used to measure the subject or task knowledge at the end of a block of instruction.  “PC/W” indicates a subject or task knowledge progress check and a separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test.    5.  Standard.  The minimum standard for written examinations is 70%.  Standards for performance objectives are indicated in the objective and are also indicated on the individual progress check checklist.  The checklist is used by the instructor to document each student’s progress in each task.  Instructor assistance is provided as directed during the project check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  Students must satisfactorily complete all progress checks prior to taking the written exam.    6.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level, which means students can do most parts of the task and needs help only on the hardest parts (PARTIALLY PROFICIENT).  The student can also name step-by-step procedures for completing the task.  7.  Course Objective List.  Detailed objectives for all Aerospace and Operational Physiology courses can be obtained from the Plan of Instruction (POI) specific to the course.  The POI for the course contains the measurement, standard, and proficiency level for each course objective.  This information is available at USAFSAM/ED, Academic Affairs Branch at Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio.    Section C – Support Materials 8.

Work Center Training Plan.  The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines and examples of proper documentation for the many electronic forms used in training of all enlisted medical personnel.  Training documentation helps to assess readiness capability, individual strengths, and weaknesses.  It also aids compliance with all Health Services Inspections (HSI) regulatory requirements.  The Enlisted Training documentation has migrated from the hard copy to electronic Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  AFTR is accessible from the Advanced Distributed Learning System via the Air Force Portal.  Refer to your unit training manager for most current policies and guidance on training documentation.  14.1.  Master Training Plan (MTP)  14.1.1.  A Master Training Plan is a reference guide developed for each section that includes all facets of training for individuals assigned.  It is used as a reference source for the type of training and training documentation that occurs with each assigned member.  The MTP is used to standardize training and to give trainers, trainees, supervisors, and NCOICs an overview of the training process for the duty section.  Training managers will implement into AFTR.  14.1.2.  The Master Training Plan is an overview of training for the duty section; it should include all information involved in the training process for the duty section.  Training will vary from section to section and person to person.  Certain documents will be a standard requirement for all MTPs.  They are listed below:  14.1.2.1.  Master Task List (MTL).  The MTL identifies all day-to-day mission (duty position) requirements, core tasks, local and contingency tasks, and additional duties performed by work center personnel.  14.1.2.2.  Current CFETP or AFJQS (if available).  14.1.2.3.  Locally developed AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard (JQS) Continuation Sheet (if applicable), which is now assessable in AFTR.  42  14.1.2.4.  Milestones for tasks and CDC completion (identify the projected time frame the trainee will complete their core tasks and each set of CDCs as required).  Recommendation: Each MTP should have an official memorandum from the work-center supervisor addressing key issues peculiar to the work-center and implementation of the MTP.  14.1.2.5.  Aerospace and Operational Physiology Training Teams are not required to develop a MTP.      43
