General.  This  instruction  establishes  basic  cargo  compartment  configurations,  standard equipment,  and  location  of  such  equipment  aboard  the  C-17A  aircraft.    Personnel  using  this instruction  should  be  aware  of  the  infinite  number  of  available  variations.    The  cargo compartment  limitations  listed  here  are  the  most  typical  for  day-to-day  operations.    For operational planning purposes, each configuration is annotated with minimum time and number of personnel to configure the aircraft.  The times quoted are approximate and are configuration times only; times do not include time needed to de-configure.  For example, to de-configure from a P-1 configuration (full side seats and center seats) and configure for C-2 (clean floor) requires significantly more than 20 minutes, which is the time allocated to configure a C-2 configuration.  All C-17A aircraft are normally configured with standard quantities of life support equipment in accordance with this instruction.  TO 1C-17A-5-2, Loading Data, USAF Series, C-17A Aircraft, Job  guide  TO  1C-17A-2-10JG-70-1,  Ground  Handling  Mission  Reconfiguration  –  Cargo Compartment,  and  this  instruction  will  be  used  by  maintenance  personnel  to  configure  the aircraft. 1.2.  Responsibilities.  Mobility  units  performing  services  on  the  C-17  aircraft,  e.g.  aircraft maintenance  unit,  terminal  services,  support  equipment  branch,  and  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment are responsible for configurations and inventory of the aircraft with the equipment listed in this instruction, TO 1C-17A-5-2, Job guide TO 1C-17A-2-10JG-70-1, or as outlined in  the mission directives.    (T-2)    This  includes  the  installation/removal/stowage  of  the  equipment  IAW  the configurations  and  equipment  tables  outlined  here.    Personnel  engaged  in  planning  operations must consider the most appropriate configurations to satisfy mission requirements and minimize variations. 1.3.  Standard  Cargo  Compartment  Configuration  Codes.  Use  the  standard  configuration letter  codes  in  Table  1.1  when  referring  to  C-17A  cargo  compartment  configurations.    Follow the letter code by the number which identifies the configuration capability tables outlined here.  Indicate each configuration code in the mission directive. Table 1.1.  Standard Cargo Compartment Configuration Letter Codes. Letter Code  Definition AE AEC C CP P SP ADP ADC CDS DV SD SLC Aeromedical Evacuation Aeromedical Evacuation and Cargo Cargo Cargo and Passengers Passengers Seat Pallet (Cargo and Passengers) Airdrop Personnel Airdrop Cargo Container Delivery System Distinguished Visitor  (VIP Support Flights) Static Display Senior Leader In-transit Conference Capsule 1.4.  Deviations.  The configurations established by this instruction may require deviations for a specific mission.  Each deviation will be carefully evaluated prior to mission operation to ensure AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-A  10 july 2014   5  flight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment.  Each mission directive will identify the cargo compartment configuration by code and the deviation, if necessary, to satisfy the mission requirement.    For  example,  an  aeromedical  evacuation  mission  may  require  more  litters  than available  in  configuration  AE-1.    Consult  the  appropriate  configuration  charts  to  determine  at what location the desired additional litters can be installed.  Indicate in the mission directive by position,  the  litter  tier  provisions  to  be  installed,  i.e.,  configuration  AE-1,  install  litter  tier provisions  J  and  L.    In  any  case  of  deviation,  consideration  must  be  given  to  corresponding changes in required equipment, including weight and balance revisions.  Aircraft supporting JCS OPORD-007  will  be  configured  In  Accordance  With  (IAW)  OPORD-007.    Any  deviations  to OPORD-007 aircraft will be coordinated through HQ AMC/XOOS. 1.5.  Weight and Balance.  Configurations, equipment, and necessary supply changes to conduct airlift missions affect the weight and balance of the aircraft.  To standardize equipment and the location of the equipment, include items shown in Table 2.1 in the basic weight of the aircraft.  Add equipment listed in Table  2.2 as necessary, and enter in references 5, 6, or 7 of DD Form 365-4,  Weight  and  Balance  Clearance  Form  F.    For  simplicity,  the  loadmaster  will  enter  the weight  and  moment  data  contained  in  the  required  equipment  table  for  the  applicable configuration.  Adjustments will be made when the actual on board weight of these items (due to deviations)  vary  from  the  data  shown.    When  aircraft  equipment  is  moved  from  its  stowage location, aircraft moment changes are not required on the DD Form 365-4.  Electronic computer data sheets may be used in lieu of the DD Form 365-4 provided these sheets contain essentially the same data listed on DD Form 365-4. 1.6.  Distribution.  The  following  agencies  should  have  direct  access  to  this  AFI:    Staff Operations,  Aircrew  Stan/Eval,  Command  Posts/Operations  centers,  Air  Terminal  Operations Centers,  Squadron/Port  Operations  officers,  Air  Freight  Management,  Fleet  Service,  Aircraft Maintenance units, alternate mission equipment sections, Quality Assurance, and Aircrew Flight Equipment  sections.    One  paper  copy  will  be  maintained  in  each  supplemental  weight  and balance handbook aboard each aircraft.

This  chapter contains basic cargo  compartment  configurations in  tabular  and floor plan format, including weight, location, and moment data for associated standard equipment. 3.2.  General.  Although  deviations  to  the  basic  configurations  are  authorized  to  meet  special requirements, consider the following factors when planning such changes: 3.2.1.  Drawings  in  this  chapter  are  not  to  scale  with  respect  to  aircraft  and  equipment location. 3.2.2.  When the ATGL  is  installed for use, the centroid will be positioned at  FS 391in  the Aerial Delivery System (ADS) rail system.  ATGLs may be transported as cargo (not for use) in either rail system.  ATGLs loaded on the aircraft ramp will be drained of all fluids. 3.2.3.  When an ATGL is onboard, eight palletized seat assemblies may be installed.  In this configuration,  the  pallet  immediately  aft  of  the  ATGL  shall  have  the  first  row  of  seats removed  from  the  pallet  assembly.    When  an  ATGL  is  not  onboard,  nine  sets  of  palletized seats may be installed. 3.2.4.  Equipment  for  ATGLs  will  be  determined  by  local  base  operating  policy.    Each lavatory should contain at a minimum of one roll of toilet paper, 1 pack of paper towels, and soap. 3.2.5.  When  carrying  more  than  40  passengers  in  any  configuration,  maximum  seating capacity must be reduced by one to accommodate the additional crewmember required to be in  the  cargo  compartment  for  takeoff  and  landing.    This  restriction  does  not  apply  to personnel airdrop missions with no planned airland mission legs. 3.2.6.  When  the  payload  consists  of  palletized  netted  cargo  or  cargo  that  is  secured  with straps,  a  30-inch  space  will  be  maintained  between  the  cargo  and  the  nearest  forward occupied seat,  litter,  or nuclear cargo.  (T-2)  When the cargo (palletized or non-palletized) is secured with chains, or when a plywood barrier and chain bridle(s) are installed to attain all  forward  restraint  on  netted  cargo,  the  30-inch  spacing  is  not  required.    Exception:  For patient access, the 30-inch spacing is always required when carrying litter patients regardless of  type  of  tiedown  used.    Sidewall  seats  directly  adjacent  to  pallets  loaded  in  the  Logistics Rail System will not be occupied during takeoff or landing regardless of pallet construction. (T-2) 3.2.7.  Palletized  seats  are  not  intended  for  prolonged  flights,  and  require  additional emergency  oxygen  sources  and  life  preservers  (overwater  flights)  to  be  added.    Palletized seats will only be occupied when loaded facing forward in the aircraft.  (T-2)  When loaded as  cargo  (not  occupied),  palletized  seats  may  be  loaded  in  any  orientation  in  either  rail system. 3.2.8.  EPOS  is  the  primary  emergency  oxygen  source  for  palletized  seats.    When  used  for that  purpose,  do  not  exceed  FL  410.    (T-2)    Oxygen  provisions  must  be  sufficient  to accomplish  the  planned  flight  from  the  equal  time  point  to  a  suitable  recovery  base.    (T-2)    10  AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-A  10 july 2014 Calculate EPOS oxygen  supply  at  60 minutes  for seated passengers.   Extended  flights  may require more than one EPOS per passenger. 3.3.  Standard  Equipment.  Equipment  in  Table  3.1  will  be  used  to  complete  the  DD  Form 365-4.  Items will be place on the aircraft as required to meet mission requirements.  Items added to or subtracted from the basic configurations will be adjusted on the DD Form 365-4.  Planning agencies  will  ensure  specific  items  needed,  above  quantities  in  the  basic  configuration,  are annotated  on  the  mission  directive.    For  example,  three  5-gallon  water  containers  are  provided for  a  P-1  configuration.    If  two  additional  5-gallon  water  containers  are  required;  annotate  the mission description as; “P-1Mod: add two 5-gallon water containers.” 3.4.  Legend  of  Configurations.

Several factors must be considered during planning of cargo airdrop operations. 4.2.1.  No overhang of load permitted on platform unless specified in the rigging TO/FM. 4.2.2.  Weight and balance will be considered at all times.  When multiple passes of airdrop loads  are  planned,  calculations  will  be  made,  prior  to  takeoff,  to  determine  the  aircraft  CG after each load has exited.  This is accomplished to assure CG flight limits are not exceeded.  This  calculation  is  required  only  for  those  loads  remaining  on  the  aircraft  following  each pass.  For sequential airdrop, calculations will be made to assure CG limits are not exceeded in the event of a malfunction resulting in platforms remaining on the aircraft. 4.3.  Personnel limitations.  The Personnel Limitations Chart (Table 4.3) reflects the number of personnel  (crews  and  passengers/troops)  that  the  crew  lavatory  and  aircraft  urinals  can accommodate.  Table 4.3 will be considered when determining number of passengers/troops that can be airlifted without an ATGL. 4.4.  Miscellaneous Data.

Aircraft-Installed  AFE  Procedures.  Handle  AFE  with  care to  avoid  damage.  Prepositioning equipment in accordance with this publication allows flexibility while the aircraft is  away  from  home-station  and  standardizes  AFE  configurations  Air  Force-wide.    For  AETC flying units where AMC is the lead command, units are authorized to load aircraft with only the mission  required  AFE.    AETC  Operations  Group  Commanders  (or  equivalent)  will  ensure  an Operational Risk Management assessment (ORM) is accomplished regarding utilization of AFE to safely support mission requirements.  (T-3)  In the event installed AFE inspection comes due while aircraft is on alert status of away from home station, follow guidance provided in TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures. 5.2.  Aircraft  Configuration.  Configure  aircraft  IAW  TO  1C-17A-1,  Flight  Manual,  USAF Series,  C-17A  Aircraft  and  TO  1C-17A-5-2.    AFE  equipment  that  is  not  being  utilized  will  be stored  in  the  survival  equipment  locker  or  in  its  designated  storage  location  as  depicted  in  TO 1C-17A-5-2.    Crewmembers  will  return  all  AFE  to  the  designated  storage  locations  after  use.  Aircraft  Commanders  may  request  additional  equipment  be  positioned  aboard  aircraft  to accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required. Table 5.1.
