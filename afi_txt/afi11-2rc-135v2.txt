"May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication.  Recommendations  for  improvements  to this  volume  will  be  submitted  on  AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication, IAW  AFI  11-215,  Flight  Manuals  Program,  to  HQ  ACC/A3TV.    Approved  recommendations will be collated into interim or formal change notices, and forwarded to HQ USAF/A3O-AT for HQ USAF/A3 approval. 1.4.  Waivers.  IAW AFI 11-202V2 and the ACC Sup, waiver requests must be routed through the  Numbered  Air  Force  (NAF)  for  comment.    Waiver  approval  authority  for  RC/OC/WC/TC-135-specific  aircrew  requirements  is  HQ  MAJCOM/A3  (ANG:  NGB/A3),  unless  otherwise specified  in  this  volume.    (ANG:    170  OSS/CC  will  be  notified  when  situations  require  an OG/CC  or  SQ/CC  approval/waiver.)    All  waiver  requests  must  include  the  following,  as applicable: 1.4.1.  Name,  rank,  crew  position,  type  aircraft,  type  of  evaluation,  expiration  date  and applicable paragraph. 1.4.2.  Justification for waiver 1.4.3.  Unit plan of action 1.5.  Evaluation Procedures:  (T-2). 1.5.1.  Flight Examiners (FEs) will use the grading policies contained in AFI 11-202V2 and the  evaluation  criteria  in  this  instruction  for  conducting  all  ACC  and  ACC-oversight  units RC/OC/WC/TC-135  Flight,  Aircrew  Training  Device  (ATD),  and  Emergency  Procedures AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015   7  Evaluations  (EPE).    All  evaluations  assume  smooth  air,  a  stable  platform,  and  normal operating conditions.  Compound emergency procedures will not be used. 1.5.2.  All  evaluations  fall  under  the  Qualification  (QUAL),  Instrument  (INSTM),  Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR) or SPOT categories listed in AFI 11-202V2.  Each squadron may design and maintain evaluation profiles for each Mission Design Series (MDS) that include information  on  each  crew  position.    These  profiles  will  be  approved  by  OGV  and  will incorporate  requirements  set  in  the  applicable  grading  criteria  and  reflect  the  primary  unit tasking. 1.5.3.  Schedule all evaluation activity on one sortie and an operational aircraft to the greatest extent possible.  All flight phase requirements should be accomplished in-flight.  If a required event  is  not  accomplished  in-flight,  OG/CC  is  the  waiver  authority  for  the  event  to  be completed  in  the  ATD  (must  be  SIMCERT  1  (Simulator  Certification  Level  1)  or  TVC  1 (Training  Value  Code  1).    This  authority  may  be  delegated  no  lower  than  SQ/CC  unless otherwise authorized in position specific chapters of this AFI. 1.5.4.  During all evaluations, any grading areas observed by the evaluator may be evaluated.  If additional training is required for areas outside of the scheduled evaluation, document the training  required  under  the  appropriate  area  on  the  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew Qualification. 1.5.5.  Each chapter in this AFI contains a table of requirements for various evaluations.  The NOTES column of each table may include an “X” which refers to a general note found in the individual grading criteria, and/or a number which refers to a note shown below the table.  To complete an evaluation, all areas annotated with an “R” must be successfully completed. 1.5.6.  Unit  flight  examiners  may  give  evaluations  outside  of  their  organization  to  include administering evaluations between ACC and ANG. 1.5.7.  Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in the grading, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective  action and such deviations do not  jeopardize flying safety.    Cumulative  deviations  will  be  considered  when  determining  the  overall  grade.  Deviations  incurred  while  employing  the  “See  and  Avoid”  concept  will  be  considered momentary deviations.  The FE will state the examinee’s overall rating, thoroughly critique specific deviations, area grades assigned and assign any required additional training. 1.5.8.  FEs  will  not  evaluate  students  with  whom  they  have  flown  50%  or  more  of  the qualification/upgrade  training  or  those  they  recommend  for  qualification/upgrade  flight evaluation without a waiver IAW AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP. 1.6.  General Evaluation Guidance (T-2) 1.6.1.  Mission  Evaluation.    IAW  AFI  11-202V2  the  requirement  for  a  separate  mission (MSN)  evaluation  is  waived.    All  QUAL  evaluations  will  contain  a  mission  scenario.    The scenario  should  be  incorporated  through  the  flight  portion  of  the  evaluation  as  much  as possible. 1.6.1.1.  For  aircrew  qualified  in  multiple  missions,  recurring  evaluations  need  only evaluate  the  primary  mission  events  as  long  as  currency  is  maintained  in  all  other required training events.   8  AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015 1.6.2.  Instrument Evaluations.  Instrument evaluations apply to pilots.  See Chapter 4 of this volume for specific requirements.  General instrument procedures should be evaluated in the ATD in conjunction with the EPE. 1.6.3.  Qualification  Evaluations.    These  evaluations  should  be  combined  with  Instrument evaluations, as applicable for the crew position. 1.6.4.  No-Notice  Evaluations. procedures/goals.   OG/CC  will determine no-notice evaluation 1.6.5.  Difference Evaluations.  Difference evaluations that do not update an eligibility zone will  be  listed  as  “SPOT”  on  the  front  of  the  AF  Form  8  and  explained  as  a  difference evaluation  under  “Mission  Description”.    These  evaluations  may  be  used  to  qualify crewmembers in a different system/tactic (e.g. baseline or avionic upgrades) within the same aircraft.  In addition they may be used to qualify mission crew personnel already qualified in one crew position in a subsequent crew position within the same MDS and crew specialty. 1.6.5.1.  The  OG/CC  will  determine  whether  a  difference  evaluation  or  certification  is required after difference training.  Specific instances requiring a difference evaluation is in  each  position  specific  evaluation  criteria  chapter  and  AFI  11-2RC-135  Volume  1, RC/OC/WC/TC-135—Aircrew Training. 1.6.6.  Qualification  in  more  than  one  RC/OC/WC/TC–135  aircraft  does  not  require MAJCOM/A3 authorization.  All –135s are considered the same MDS for basic qualification purposes.  However, crewmembers flying multiple models (i.e. RC-135 V/W, RC-135S, and RC-135U or WC-135 and OC-135, etc) may need to obtain qualification or certifications in the various models depending on the requirements listed in this AFI and AFI 11-2RC-135V1. 1.6.7.  Instructor Evaluations. 1.6.7.1.  Initial Instructor flight evaluations should be conducted with a student occupying the applicable aircrew position whenever possible. 1.6.7.2.  The instructor examinee will monitor all phases of flight from an advantageous position and be prepared to demonstrate or explain any area or procedure.  The FE will particularly  note  the  instructor's  ability  to  recognize  student  difficulties  and  provide effective, timely corrective action. 1.6.7.3.  The  FE  should  also  evaluate  the  grade  assigned  and  TAPR  (Training Accomplishment Report) completed for the student on all initial instructor checks. 1.6.7.4.  The student will perform those duties prescribed by the instructor for the sortie being  accomplished.    If  an  actual  student  is  not  available,  the  FE  will  identify  to  the examinee  (prior  to  the  mission)  the  level  of  performance  to  be  expected  from  the  FE acting  as  the  student.    If  this  option  is  utilized,  at  least  one  event  or  briefing  must  be instructed. 1.6.7.5.  Periodic instructor evaluations will be administered in conjunction with required qualification and instrument flight  evaluations.  The examinee must occupy the primary duty  position  for  an  adequate  period  of  time  to  demonstrate  proficiency  in  the  crew position with required qualification and instrument flight evaluations. 1.6.7.6.  All instructor evaluations will include a pre-flight and post-flight briefing. AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015   9  1.6.8.  Senior Staff Officer (SSO) Evaluations 1.6.8.1.  For  evaluations  of  members  in  the  SSO  training  program,  annotate  the  crew position on the AF Form 8 as either FP (pilot), FN (navigator), FE (EWO), or FA (IIO) IAW AFI 11-401_ACCSUP_I, Aviation Management. 1.6.8.2.  Add  the  following  restriction  in  the  remarks  section  of  the  AF  Form  8:  “RESTRICTION:  This  evaluation permits operating the aircraft from the primary crew position only under direct supervision of an instructor (fill in appropriate crew position).” 1.6.8.3.  Check  the  crew  position  tables  in  subsequent  chapters  for  areas  exempt  from evaluation.   10  AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015 Chapter 2 GROUND REQUISITES 2.1.  General.  Ground  requirements  for  instrument,  qualification  and  mission  evaluations  are listed in this chapter.  Flight requirements are in position specific chapters. 2.2.  Ground Phase Requisites (T-2).  Requirements listed in Table 2.1 are common to all crew positions  and  will  be  accomplished  IAW  AFI  11-202V2,  as  supplemented,  and  unit  directives.  These should be accomplished prior to the flight phase. 2.2.1.  Publications  Check.    The  publications  check  is  a  requisite  to  all  qualification evaluations,  and  will  be  annotated  in  the  Comments  block  of  the  AF  Form  8  only  if unsatisfactory.    Annual  and  Change  LEP  checks  in  individually  issued  flight  manuals  must be  accomplished,  documented,  and  current.    Unit  OGV  will  list  the  required  flight publications  each  aircrew  member  is  responsible  for  in  the  local  supplement  to  AFI  11-202V2. Table 2.1.  Crew Position Specific Requisites.

This exam consists of 25-50 questions derived from applicable flight manuals and governing directives. OG/OGV will determine the necessary number of questions to be included for each MDS and crew position. 2.2.2.  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluations  (EPE).    Every  Qualification  evaluation  which updates an expiration date will include an EPE.  For pilots, the FE will administer the EPE in the ATD when available.  Document the method of EPE accomplishment in the Comments block  of  the  AF  Form  8.    For  all  other  crewmembers,  an  EPE  will  be  accomplished  orally and  Emergency  Procedures  grading  criteria  will  be  used  to  evaluate  this  event.    Units  will determine  scenarios  for  EPEs.    The  FE  will  assign  an  overall  EPE  grade  (1  or  3)  in  the qualification ground phase block of the AF Form 8. AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015   11  Chapter 3 GENERAL GRADING INSTRUCTIONS AND AREAS 3.1.  Grading  Instructions  and  General  Grading  Criteria  (T-2).  Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-202V2 and this instruction.  A three-level grading system (Q, Q-,  and  U)  is  used  for  most  areas;  however  a  "Q-"  grade  will  not  be  indicated  under  critical areas. 3.1.1.  Critical Areas.  Critical areas are events that require adequate accomplishment by the examinee in order to successfully achieve the sortie objectives and complete the evaluation.  If an examinee receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be "Q-3."  Critical  areas are identified by "(CRITICAL)" following the applicable area title. 3.1.2.  Non-critical Areas.  If an examinee receives a "U" grade in a non-critical area then the overall grade awarded will be no higher than "Q-2."  An examinee receiving a "Q-" grade in a non-critical area or areas may still receive a "Q-1" overall grade at evaluator discretion.  An overall "Q-3" can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas. 3.1.3.  The  FE  must  exercise  judgment  when  the  wording  of  areas  is  subjective  and  when specific situations are not covered. 3.1.4.  Evaluator  judgment  will  be  the  final  determining  factor  in  deciding  the  overall qualification level. 3.2.  General  Grading  Criteria  (T-2).  Table  3.1  lists  general  areas  to  be  evaluated  for  all applicable  evaluations.    The  following  general  qualification  criteria  are  common  to  all  crew positions and will be used for all applicable evaluations: Table 3.1.  General Grading Areas (All Crew Positions).

Written parameters  must  be task accomplishment in the determination of overall aircrew performance.  Specific requirements for each evaluation are as follows: tempered  with  sortie  objectives,  evaluator judgment,  and 4.2.  Qualification Evaluations (T-2): 4.2.1.  Ground Requisites: See Table 2.1 4.2.2.  Flight  Phase:  All  areas  required  in  Table  4.1  under  AC  (Aircraft  Commander qualification)  or  PQ  (Pilot  qualification)  will  be  evaluated,  unless  not  applicable  to  the specific aircraft as noted.  During recurring evaluations for aircraft commanders, a right seat approach and landing is required.  Any approach work (exceptions: Areas 26 Landing and 29 Simulated  Engine  Out  Pattern/Landing)  not  completed  on  the  scheduled  sortie  may  be completed in the ATD (if available) with OG/CC approval. 4.2.3.  Copilots initially upgrading to aircraft commander will have a qualified IP (desired) or FE (secondary) in the copilot’s position during critical phases of flight. 4.3.  Mission Certifications (T-2).  Mission Certifications ensure that individuals are capable of performing  duties  essential  to  the  effective  employment  of  the  aircraft.    Mission  Certifications are  accomplished  IAW  local  training  requirements  and/or  SQ/CC  directions.    Mission certification  flight  events  are  normally  performed  during  Qualification  evaluations,  but  may  be performed on any flight with an instructor certified in that mission. 4.3.1.  Multiple  Mission  Certifications.    When  authorized  by  the  OG/CC  IAW  11-2RC-135V1, to establish or maintain mission certifications in more than one -135 model, use the following  guidance.    To  add  an  additional  -135  model  (RC/OC/WC),  a  separate  mission certification  for  that  model  will  be  accomplished.    Some  model  transitions  may  require  a difference evaluation, see paragraph 4.5 for further guidance.  To initially mission certify in more  than  one  -135  model,  or  for  recurring  evaluations  of  pilots  mission  certified  in  more than one -135 model, complete flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2.  Ensure Qualification Examination(s) and Emergency Procedures Examination(s) cover all applicable models and mission requirements.  For aircraft commanders mission certifying in a model with reversers, reverse  thrust  landing  must  be  evaluated  in  a  reverse  thrust  equipped  aircraft  for  initial Qualification evaluations. 4.3.2.  Qualification in either F108 or TF-33 aircraft will be initiated by initial qualification in  one  engine  type,  followed  by  a  difference  qualification  in  the  other.    Subsequent  annual qualification evaluation in one engine type will satisfy requirements for both types of aircraft, provided ground testing encompasses both aircraft types and the individual is current in both engine types. 4.4.  Instrument Evaluations (T-2): 4.4.1.  Ground Requisites. Instrument Examination. 4.4.2.  Flight Phase. All areas required in Table 4.1 under "INSTM" will be evaluated. AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015   17  4.5.  Difference Evaluations (T-2): 4.5.1.  Ground Requisites: Closed Book exam with Boldface. 4.5.1.1.  Pilots  transitioning  from  the  KC-135  or  707  series  aircraft  models  to  an RC/OC/WC/TC-135, require an Open Book, Closed Book, Boldface, and EPE.  The EPE should emphasize the difference between models. 4.5.2.  Flight  Phase:  Required  transitions  will  be  IAW  AFI  11-2RC-135V1.    The  following transitions also require a flight evaluation. Evaluate applicable items in Table 4.2 4.5.2.1.  Transition  from  non-reverser  equipped  aircraft  to  an  aircraft  model  with  thrust reversers.    Flight  Phase  for  Thrust  Reverser  Engines  transition  consists  of  Landing (reverse thrust) and Simulated Engine Out Pattern/Landing (reverse thrust) (AC/IP only). 4.5.2.2.  Pilots  not  qualified in  receiver  air  refueling who seek qualification for receiver air refueling.  Flight Phase for air refueling transition consists of AR/Receiver. 4.6.  Instructor  Evaluations  (T-2).  Pilots  receiving  initial  instructor  evaluations  must  occupy the  right  seat  for  evaluation  of  takeoff,  air  refueling,  initial  buffet  (ATD  only),  and  all  traffic pattern  activity.    An  IP  or  FE  must  occupy  the  left  seat.    On  recurring  checks,  instructors  may occupy either seat to accomplish required items in Table 4.1.  A student, pilot, copilot, IP, or FE may occupy the opposite pilot position.  All "INSTR" areas must be evaluated.  In all cases, the examinee  will  occupy  the  position  normally  required  to  instruct,  and  will  perform  all  tasks  as demonstration items. 4.6.1.  Instructor examinees will accomplish the following demonstrations: 4.6.1.1.  Air refueling envelope demonstration. 4.6.1.2.  Approach to initial buffet (Initial C-135 Instructor Check; accomplish only in the ATD). 4.6.1.3.  30 Flap landing. 4.6.1.4.  Touch and Go landing. 4.6.2.  Grade  demos  using  the  criteria  for  Area  38,  Demonstration  and  Performance.    To receive  a  Q  grade  for  the  air  refueling  envelope  demo  the  examinee  must  satisfy  Area  19 criteria.  To receive a Q grade for the 30 Flap landing/Touch and Go landing, the examinee must  satisfy  the  criteria  for  Area  26,  Landing,  and  Area  27,  Touch  and  Go  landings.  Unsatisfactory performance may result in U grades for both areas depending on the nature of the discrepancy. 4.6.3.  Instructor Requalification Evaluations.  Will be IAW AFI 11-2RC-135V1 and AFI 11-202V2.  Follow guidance for Recurring Instructor Evaluations. 4.7.  Emergency Procedures Evaluations (T-2), additional guidance: 4.7.1.

Refers to a general note found in the individual grading criteria 5.8.  General Grading Criteria:  For grading general areas, see Chapter 3. 5.9.  Specific Grading Criteria (T-2): 5.9.1.  AREA 9, Flight Plan/Charts. 5.9.1.1.  Q.  Selected current  navigation charts of proper scale  and type for the mission.  Charts and flight plan were prepared in accordance with the flight manual and governing directives.  Chart was annotated with required information.  Route was plotted with errors not  to  exceed  5  NM.    Flight  plan  was  complete  with  no  more  than  minor  errors/ omissions; no error exceeded 5 degrees of heading and/or 2 minutes of time. 5.9.1.2.  Q-.  Route  plotting  errors  did  not  exceed  10  NM.    No  more  than  four  errors exceeded Q tolerances and no error exceeded 10 degrees of heading and/or 4 minutes of time. AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015   35  5.9.1.3.  U.  Flight  plan  or  chart  was  not  completed,  or  contained  major  errors  or omissions  which  would  affect  mission  accomplishment.    Selected  improper  or  obsolete charts.    Exceeded  Q-  criteria.                        NOTES        1.    Computer-generated  products  are authorized for all mission planning. When used, the navigator is responsible for the data’s accuracy.        2.    Errors  that  occur  as  a  result  of  a  previous  error  will  not  be  considered when applying the grading criteria. 5.9.2.  AREA 10, General Navigation and Inflight Information. 5.9.2.1.  Q.  Maintained  course,  any  deviations  were  momentary  and  did  not  exceed  5 NM  (2  NM  or  as  specified  for  operations  below  Flight  Level  (FL)  180)  from  ARTCC-cleared  course.    System  crosschecks  using  all  available  resources  were  accomplished during the flight.  Significant errors were resolved prior to the next crosscheck. 5.9.2.2.  Q-.  Did  not  allow  the  airplane  to  deviate  more  than  10  NM  (4  NM  or  as specified  for  operations  below  FL  180)  from  the  course.    System  crosschecks  using  all available resources were accomplished during the flight. 5.9.2.3.  U.  Exceeded Q- tolerances.         NOTE:  The navigator is always responsible for position awareness.  Navigator’s primary responsibility for navigation commences at level  off  and  ceases  when  the  pilot  or  air  traffic  controller  assumes  responsibility  for navigation to the terminal facility. 5.9.3.  AREA 11, Pacing. 5.9.3.1.  Q.  Held  an  even  workflow  achieving  maximum  use  of  available  time.    Stayed ahead  of  flight  progress.    Ensured  accurate  and  timely  position  reports,  alter  headings, and/or control times.  Expeditiously dealt with deviations from original flight plan. 5.9.3.2.  Q-.  Pacing  was  adequate  but  occasionally  worked  behind  aircraft.    Position reports  not  over  5  minutes  late  and  turning  points  not  over  flown  by  more  than  two minutes. 5.9.3.3.  U.  Overall pacing was unsatisfactory.  Worked behind aircraft throughout most of  flight.    Position  reports  were  late  by  more  than  5  minutes  and  turn  points  were  over flown by more than two minutes. 5.9.4.  AREA 12, Communication Device Loading Procedures. 5.9.4.1.  Q.  Examinee will load Mode 4 Codes and load secure voice in the UHF or VHF radio IAW prescribed procedures and within limitations. 5.9.4.2.  Q-.  Codes  required  for  the  sortie  were  improperly  set/loaded  due  to  minor deviations  and  equipment  was  not  operated  completely  IAW  prescribed  procedures  but equipment limitations were not exceeded and sortie success was not jeopardized. 5.9.4.3.  U.  Examinee was unable to set/load required codes, equipment was not operated IAW  prescribed  procedures,  equipment  limitations  would  have  been  exceeded  without evaluator intervention and sortie success was affected.         NOTE:  Examinee will not be  held  responsible  for  equipment  malfunctions  as  long  as  procedures  were  correct.    If codes  cannot  be  loaded  due  to  equipment  malfunction  or  timing,  an  oral  evaluation  of these procedures will fulfill the requirement in this area. 5.9.5.  AREA 13, Equipment Operation.   36  AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015 5.9.5.1.  Q.  Navigation  equipment  was  operated  IAW  prescribed  procedures  with  no more  than  minor  deviations  or  omissions  that  could  not  cause  damage  to  equipment  or significantly  degrade  system  performance.    Equipment  malfunctions  were  correctly analyzed  and  corrected  when  possible  for  satisfactory  equipment  capability.    The coordinates in the navigation system were never more than 5 NM in error provided there were no equipment malfunctions. 5.9.5.2.  Q-.  Navigation  equipment  was  not  operated  IAW  prescribed  procedures.  Equipment malfunctions were incorrectly analyzed or corrective actions were incomplete or incorrect.  Variations or omissions in prescribed procedures, erroneous data insertion, or faulty techniques caused a significant degradation of equipment performance.  In any case actions could not have damaged equipment or jeopardized mission objectives.  The coordinates in the navigation system were never more than 10 NM in error provided there were no equipment malfunctions. 5.9.5.3.  U.  Exceeded  Q-  criteria.                          NOTE:    The  extent  of  in-flight  corrective action required of the navigator to alleviate a search radar malfunction will be determined by the mission requirements. 5.9.6.  AREA 14, Air Refueling. 5.9.6.1.  Q.  Rendezvous  and  air  refueling  procedures  were  IAW  prescribed  procedures and  all  checklists  were  accomplished  with  no  more  than  minor  discrepancies.    Met planned air refueling timing +/- 1.5 minutes using all reasonable effort.  If unable to make the  scheduled  air  refueling  rendezvous  time  after  using  speed  control  and  route adjustment techniques, coordinated a revised RVCT.  No training was lost by the tanker or receiver which could be attributed to the navigator’s error.  Directed closure to within 1 NM of tanker. 5.9.6.2.  Q-.  Displayed  lack  of  knowledge  and  familiarity  with  the  checklists  and/or rendezvous  and  air  refueling  procedures,  however,  knowledge  was  sufficient  to accomplish  rendezvous  and  air  refueling  with  minimal  loss  of  training  time/activity.  Ineffective  timing  control  resulted  in  unnecessarily  delaying  the  rendezvous.    Poor planning  or  inattention  on  the  navigator’s  part  caused  the  examinee  to  overlook  timing control  until  it  was  too  late  to  make  the  rendezvous  using  speed  control  and  route adjustment techniques (greater than 1.5 minutes but less than 2.5 minutes of briefed time of  the  RVCT)  but  a  revised  RVCT  was  then  coordinated  prior  to  the  IP.    Receiver navigator directed closure to  within 1 NM of tanker.  No significant  amount  of training was lost by the tanker or receiver. 5.9.6.3.  U.  Displayed  lack  of  knowledge  and  familiarity  with  the  checklists  and/or rendezvous and air refueling procedures to the extent that the rendezvous or air refueling was jeopardized or precluded or significant training time/activity was lost.  Poor planning or  inattention  on  the  navigator’s  part  caused  the  examinee  to  overlook  timing  control until  it  was  too  late  to  make  the  rendezvous  using  speed  control  and  route  adjustment techniques,  and  no  revision  was  made  to  the  RVCT.    Timing  exceeded  Q-  tolerances.  Significant  training  was  lost  by  tanker  or  receiver.    Receiver  navigator  was  unable  to direct  closure  to  within  1  NM  of  tanker.    Rendezvous  radio  calls  were  incorrect, extremely non-standard or late to a degree that caused confusion and compromised safety of flight.          NOTES:      1.  Navigators must demonstrate proficiency in ATP-56(B) AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015   37  and  established  flight  manual  procedures.                2.    Air  refueling  includes  rendezvous (Point  Parallel/RV  Delta  or  Enroute/RV  Golf),  orbit,  interplane  communications, breakaway,  and  post  air  refueling.                3.    Examinee  will  not  be  penalized  for  radio malfunctions or limitations (e.g., unable to contact a command post) that prevent revising the rendezvous time or accomplishing required radio calls on time. 5.9.7.  AREA 15, Landing Gear Alternate Extension. 5.9.7.1.  Q.  Landing  gear  alternate  extension  procedures  were  performed  with  no deviations or with minor deviations or omissions that did not affect the safe outcome of the procedure and crew coordination was satisfactory. 5.9.7.2.  Q-.  Landing  gear  alternate  extension  procedures  were  performed  with  several minor  deviations  or  omissions  that  could  have  affected  the  outcome  of  the  procedure.  Crew coordination was satisfactory with minor errors. 5.9.7.3.  U.  Landing  gear  alternate  extension  procedures  were  performed  with  major deviations  or  omissions  that  affected  the  safe  outcome  of  the  procedure.    Crew coordination  was  unsatisfactory  and/or  safety  was  compromised.                NOTE:  Emergency  extension  of  landing  gear  will  be  accomplished  by  navigators  on  initial qualification and initial instructor evaluations only.  Need not be re-accomplished when qualifying in other series aircraft equipped with identical emergency extension systems. 5.9.8.  AREA 16, Descent/Approach/Landing. 5.9.8.1.  Q.  Monitored aircraft position and approach instructions.  Configured FMS for appropriate approaches and verified correct landing data was loaded (N/A OC/WC-135).  Furnished  the  pilot  with  headings,  ETAs,  and  other  information  when  required.  Thoroughly  understood  approach  and/or  missed  approach  instructions/procedures.  Monitored  appropriate  FLIP  terminal  approach  plate.    Made  all  required  calls,  and ensured terrain clearance. 5.9.8.2.  Q-.  Monitored  aircraft  position  but  did  not  monitor  or  understand  approach and/or missed approach instructions/procedures.  Slow in providing headings, ETAs, and other information when required. 5.9.8.3.  U.  Failed  to  monitor  aircraft  position.    Did  not  ensure  terrain  clearance  during approach.    Incorrectly  loaded  FMS  landing  data  and  approach  was  delayed,  or  wrong approach was loaded into FMS. 5.9.9.  AREA 22, Data Track (RC-135S/U). 5.9.9.1.  Q.  Present position counters were no more than 5 NM in error throughout data run provided there were no significant equipment malfunctions.  Roll out at top of track (TOT) was made good within 1 minute of planned/announced timing and collection was not  degraded  by  the  aircraft  position.    The  navigator  forwarded  the  maximum  time-on-track  and  current  true  heading  to  the  TC  within  2  minutes  after  initial  rollout  and  all subsequent  rollouts during the data run.  The aircraft heading was corrected to  within 2 degrees  of  desired  data  run  heading  not  later  than  3  minutes  after  rollout  on  the  data track. 5.9.9.2.  Q-.  Present  position  counters  were  no  more  than  10  NM  in  error  throughout data  run  provided  there  were  no  significant  equipment  malfunctions.    Roll  out  at  TOT   38  AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015 was  made  good  within  90  seconds  of  planned/announced  timing  and  collection  was degraded  but  still  accomplished.    The  navigator  forwarded  the  maximum  time-on-track and current true heading to the TC within 3 minutes after initial rollout and all subsequent rollouts  during  the  data  run.    The  aircraft  heading  was  corrected  to  within  3  degrees  of desired data run heading not later than 5 minutes after rollout on the data track. 5.9.9.3.  U.  Exceeded  Q-  criteria.                    NOTES:                1.    RC-135S  navigators  must demonstrate data track procedures by planning and flying a data track leg. Data track is that portion of navigation that starts at rollout on data run until return to orbit or roll out on  heading  when  departing  the  data  track.  Any  enroute  navigation  exercises  or procedures will terminate at roll in point (RIP) at TOT and may resume within 5 minutes of the end of data track or receipt of the RTB message.          2.  During orbit and data track, aircraft position will be monitored at  all times. Recording of aircraft positions on data  run  paperwork  fulfills  the  requirements  of  aircraft  position/crosscheck.          3.    In-flight information will be recorded IAW mission directives/AFI 11-2RC-135 Volume 3.        4.    Evaluatees  will  be  able  to  identify  and  discuss  differences  between  COBRA  BALL and COMBAT SENT navigation procedures. 5.9.10.  AREA 23, Reconnaissance Orbit Area Procedures (RC-135V/W). 5.9.10.1.  Q.  Orbit  area  procedures  were  in  accordance  with  prescribed  directives  and were accomplished with no more than minor discrepancies.  Every reasonable effort was made to make exit timing within +/- 1.5 minutes of briefed control time with no degrade to  collection  activity.    Repositioned  aircraft  as  required  to  cover  tactical  mission requirements and no collection was lost due to aircraft positioning. 5.9.10.2.  Q-.  Displayed a lack of knowledge and familiarity with orbit area procedures.  However,  knowledge  was  sufficient  to  ensure  orbit  area  procedures  were  accomplished with  minimal  loss  of  training  or  collection  activity.    Exit  timing  was  greater  than  1.5 minutes but less than 2.5 minutes of briefed time. 5.9.10.3.  U.  Displayed a lack of knowledge and familiarity with orbit area procedures to the  extent  that  the  orbit  area  procedures  were  jeopardized  or  training  time/collection activity was lost.  Failed to position the aircraft over the exit point within 2.5 minutes of the briefed control time.  If aircraft was covering friendly assets, collection capability was degraded  due  to  aircraft  positioning                  NOTE:  If  the  reconnaissance  orbit  area procedures  must  be  terminated  or  abbreviated  for  weather,  equipment  malfunction, emergency,  or  mission  profile  change,  the  evaluator  may  give  credit  for  this  event provided all "Q" requirements are met.  Grade orbit area procedures IAW AFI 11-2RC-135V1. 5.9.11.  AREA 24, OPEN SKIES Operations 5.9.11.1.  Q.  Maintained  course,  any  deviations  were  momentary  and  did  not  affect mission  accomplishment.    System  crosschecks  using  all  available  resources  were accomplished  every  30  minutes  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  navigation  equipment,  and significant  errors were resolved prior to  the next crosscheck.  A minimum  of two Open Skies turns and three sensor legs were flown with no adverse effect on sensor operations. 5.9.11.2.  Q-.  Deviations from course were minor and would have had a minimal effect on  mission  accomplishment.    System  crosschecks  using  all  available  resources  were AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015   39  accomplished  during  the  flight  but  exceeded  30  minutes,  or  significant  errors  were  not addressed in a timely manner.  Improper execution of Open Skies turns would have led to a minor loss of sensor operations. 5.9.11.3.  U.  Exceeded Q- criteria. 5.9.12.  AREA 25, OPEN SKIES Navigation Leg Communications. 5.9.12.1.  Q.  Made  90  percent  or  more  of  the  required  sensor  call  actions.    Timely  and effective communication with the pilots and mission crew did not prevent successful data collection. 5.9.12.2.  Q-.  Made 80 percent or more of the required sensor call actions.  Deviations or omissions in communications resulted in significant degradation of data collection. 5.9.12.3.  U.  Exceeded Q- criteria.          NOTES:   1.  The required sensor action calls are:  one  minute  to  sensor  on;  30  seconds  to  sensor  on;  countdown  to  sensor  on;  30 seconds to sensor off; countdown to sensor off.       2.  Sensor calls will not be considered missed if they conflict with other call/actions that are critical to flight safety and/or data collection. 5.9.13.  AREA 26, CONSTANT PHOENIX Operations. 5.9.13.1.  Q.  Adequately  monitored  position  and  ensured  placement  of  aircraft  to optimize collection IAW WC-135 orbit and re-intercept procedures.  System crosschecks using all available resources were accomplished every 30 minutes to verify the accuracy of  navigation  equipment,  and  significant  errors  were  resolved  prior  to  the  next crosscheck.  Kept aircraft within bounds of operating area at all times. 5.9.13.2.  Q-.  Deviations from course were minor and would have had a minimal effect on mission accomplishment.  Displayed a lack of familiarity with WC-135 orbit and re-intercept  procedures.   System  crosschecks  using  all  available  resources  were accomplished  during  the  flight  but  exceeded  30  minutes,  or  significant  errors  were  not addressed in a timely manner.  Aircraft strayed outside the operating area boundary. 5.9.13.3.  U.  Exceeded Q- criteria.   40  AFI11-2RC-135V2  23 MARCH 2015 Chapter 6 ELECTRONIC WARFARE OFFICER (EWO) EVALUATIONS 6.1.  General.
