Section A – General Information 1. Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program. The plan outlines the training individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop 3                 and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training. Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9- skill level. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airman. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes. Some are: 1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate career field training programs. It’s also used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in this AFS and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual's career. 1.3. Lists training courses available in this AFS, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method. 1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process. 2. Uses. This plan will be used by MFMs, superintendents and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive  and  cohesive  training  programs  are  available  for  each  individual  in  the  specialty. Each enlisted financial manager should have a copy of this plan for his or her personal reference. 2.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP. They also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements. Identified training requirements can be satisfied through OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses. MAJCOM developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into this training plan. 2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority.  The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. 4. Interim CFETP Changes. The AFCFM can approve CFETP changes at any time. Messages, e-mails, or other documentation that identifies AFCFM approved changes will serve as the official 4            CFETP supplement until the next formal CFETP revision.

Career Skill Progression. Adequate training and timely progression from the helper to the superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission. In this career field, all Career Development Courses (CDCs) for upgrade training will be completed within 12 months of enrollment in the first course. Trainees are required to complete at least one volume every 30 days. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel, also must complete all CDCs within 12 months of enrollment in the first course; however, they will not be required to complete one volume every 30 days. This ensures adequate progression towards attainment of the higher skill level. An effective training program requires a team effort. It is essential that individuals involved in training must do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career. 6.1. Apprentice (3) Level. Financial Management and Comptroller AFSC 6F031: Initial skills training in this specialty consist of the tasks and knowledge training provided in the 3-skill level in-resident course. Individuals must complete the basic financial management course to be awarded the 6F031 AFSC. As a 6F031, you may be assigned to any functional area within a base level comptroller organization. 6.2. Journeyman (5) Level. Financial Management and Comptroller, AFSC 6F051: The financial management journeyman is a leader in the making. All STS core tasks, tasks listed on the XFFA1 and XFFA7 Unit Type Code (UTC) task listings (based on the UTC the member is assigned), job qualification training, and completion of the 5-skill level CDC are required for upgrade.  Job qualification consists of completion of duty position task and knowledge areas. The Core Task OJT Guides will be used to train and sign-off core tasks and are available on the AF Portal website.  To access the guides select the following: SAF/FM/Enlisted Matters/Enlisted OJT training/Core Training Files. Senior Airmen will attend Airman Leadership School before promotion to Staff Sergeant. Additional knowledge and use of automated systems is also desirable during this phase of an Airman's career. Active pursuit of an Associate’s Degree in Financial Management through the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) is highly encouraged.      8  6.3. Craftsman (7) Level. Financial Management and Comptroller, AFSC 6F071: Further broadening of our financial warrior and leader continues with the requirements set forth to obtain this skill level. The breadth of experience widens and the increase in responsibilities grows upon attainment of our financial management 7-skill level. To be upgraded to the 7-skill level in this specialty, individuals must be re-trained and signed-off on all core tasks, complete qualification training, the 7-level CDC, and the 7-level craftsman course in-residence. In addition to this training, individuals must be signed off on all tasks listed on the XFFA2 Unit Type Code (UTC) task listing.  Craftsman personnel may be assigned to any financial management functional area at base level or a MAJCOM/FOA staff (preferably as a MSgt). TSgt or TSgt selectees will complete the Non-Commissioned Officer Academy by correspondence. MSgt or MSgt selects should complete Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Academy (SNCOA) by correspondence or in-residence. MSgts and TSgts (by exception) may attend the Financial Management Staff Officer Course (FMSOC); Completion of the SNCOA in-residence or by correspondence and Associates in Applied Sciences degree through CCAF are requirements for enlisted attendance at the FMSOC. Completion of an Associate’s Degree in Financial Management through CCAF is highly recommended for all FM Craftsmen. Obtaining a professional certification such as Certified Defense Financial Manager (CDFM), Certified Government Financial Manager (CGFM), etc. is encouraged.  Additional certifications can be located through the AF Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (AF COOL) website.  Individuals should pursue a Baccalaureate Degree in a related field. 6.4. Superintendent (9) Level. Financial Management and Comptroller, AFSC 6F091:  By obtaining this skill level, you are achieving a significant step towards the pinnacle of the enlisted career ladder. For upgrade to the 9-skill level in this specialty, you must be a SMSgt. Superintendent personnel work as the wing/base level Financial Management and Comptroller (FM) superintendent.  MSgts and SMSgt selectees should attend the USAF Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy in-residence and will attend the Superintendent Workshop (only MSgts filling Superintendent billet are permitted to attend). Completion of the Defense Financial Management Course (DFMC) will further enhance this financial management leader’s skills (completion of the SNCOA in-residence and an Associate’s degree through CCAF are requirements for enlisted attendance).  Obtaining a professional certification such as Certified Defense Financial Manager (CDFM), Certified Government Financial Manager (CGFM), etc. is encouraged.  Additional certifications can be located on the AF Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (AF COOL) website.  Individuals should pursue a Baccalaureate Degree in a related field and certification under the SAF/FM Professional Development Program.  6.5. Job rotations.  Allowing members to rotate sections can be used as a learning tool and is pivotal to the enhancement and professional development of each individual.  This will promote a greater scope of knowledge and technical expertise.  Enlisted members below the rank of SMSgt must rotate to a different section at a minimum of every 36 months.  This does not preclude moving an individual to a different section prior to the 36th month and does not reset due to permanent change of station (PCS) or permanent change of assignment (PCA).  Sections include Financial Analysis, Financial Services, Quality Assurance, Resource Advisor, and Major Command (MAJCOM) staff positions.  Base level Superintendents are authorized to postpone assignment to a different section due to mission requirements, upcoming separations, PCS, or deployments for up to one year.  Extensions beyond one year must be approved by the MFM.  Base level Superintendents and MFMs will work together to ensure individuals assigned to one-deep positions are afforded the opportunity for job rotation when feasible.  This may require transferring a person from one MAJCOM to another.  Job rotations are not applicable to members of the Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard or Active Duty MSgts permanently assigned to a Superintendent billet at a Comptroller Squadron or Flight.  6.6 FM Certification.  The FY12 National Defense Authorization Act authorized the Secretary of 9   Defense to establish a financial management professional certification program that requires all who perform financial management functions to attain and maintain a DoD FM Certification.  Achieving  this certification serves as a guide towards professional development, helps identify training when  seeking new responsibilities, and improves financial management and leadership skills.  Additional  guidance can be found in Air Force Supplemental 65-117, Administration of Air Force Financial Management Certification Program (pending release).  Certification will be attained based on the following levels:   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Airman Basic – Staff Sergeant Technical Sergeant – Master Sergeant Senior Master Sergeant – Chief Master Sergeant   7. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to complete training requirements for the Financial Management and Comptroller career field. It includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. A Specialty Training Requirement Team (STRT) was held in April 2014 followed by the Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) in January 2015 to review and discuss STS tasks related to the Financial Management and Comptroller career field. These U&TW decisions form the basis of the STS items found in Part II, Section A of this CFETP and are considered necessary training requirements, both during initial skills training and beyond, to support this AFSC in the future.  The STS used for technical training will be provided by AETC for 3-skill level classes beginning 24 August 2015.  The 7-skill level in-residence class will be effective on or after 17 August 2015.  The 5-skill level CDC will be activated on 11 January 2016 and the 7-skill level CDC will be activated on 15 January 2016. 7.1.  Initial  Skills  Training.  The  initial  skills  course  is  designed  to  prepare  the  graduate  to  begin working in any base-level Financial Management and Comptroller organization. An outcome of the U&TW in  decision  support,  Defense  Enterprise  Accounting Management Systems (DEAMS), and additional systems training.  increased includes training 7.2. 5-Level Upgrade Requirements. Financial Management and Comptroller, AFSC 6F051: Successful completion of the 5-skill level CDC is required for upgrade. The CDC incorporates tasks related to all the functional areas within the Financial Management and Comptroller career field. Completion of all core tasks, job qualification training, and all tasks listed for the UTC the member is assigned are required for upgrade.  Once members have completed the tasks for their assigned UTC, they must complete the tasks for the corresponding 5-level UTC within 12 months after 5-skill level award (Ex. Member assigned to XFFA1 UTC completes XFFA1 UTC tasks, receives 5-skill level award, given all requirements are met, and then completes XFFA7 UTC tasks within 12 months). 7.3. 7-Level Upgrade Requirements. Financial Management and Comptroller, AFSC 6F071: The CDC includes tasks related to the Financial Management and Comptroller career field and successful completion is required for upgrade. The 7-level in-residence course provides financial managers an understanding of decision support and skills necessary for deployment to a contingency operation.  Completion of the course, all core tasks, job qualification training, and tasks listed on the XFFA2 Unit Type Code (UTC) task listing are required for upgrade. 7.4. Proficiency Training. Additional knowledge and skill requirements not taught through initial skills or upgrade training are available through supplemental training courses. Personnel should take 10      an active interest in obtaining additional training at every opportunity.  8. Community College of the Air Force. Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of Basic Military training. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate of Applied Sciences Degree.  Additional off-duty education is a personal choice that is encouraged for all.  Individuals desiring to become an AETC Instructor must possess as a minimum and associate degree or should be actively pursuing an associate degree.

Implementation.  This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for 3-skill level classes beginning 24 August 2015.  The 7-skill level in-residence class will be effective on 17 August 2015. 2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, this STS: 2.1. Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks,  knowledge, and Technical References (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. Number task statements sequentially i.e., 1.1, 1.2, and 2.1 Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements. 2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document technician qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a certification or completed date. (As a minimum, use the following column designators: Training Complete, Certifier Initials)  2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task and knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course  2.4. Qualitative Requirements. STS contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and CDC courses. 2.5. Used to document task when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201. 2.6. Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply: 2.6.1. Documentation. Consult AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, for documentation questions and issues. Note:  The Financial Management Functional Community mandated use of Air Force Training Record (AFTR) effective 29 August 2008.  Guidance and training material can be found on the SAF/FM AFTR Community of Practice: https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AF-FM-XH-04 2.6.2. Training Standard. For On-the-Job Training, tasks are trained and qualified to the “go/no go” level. Do not use the proficiency codes for OJT. These codes are used strictly for the in residence 3-skill level and 7-skill level courses and the 5-skill level CDCs. “Go” means the individual is capable and competent to perform tasks without assistance and meets local demands for performance, accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. 2.7. The STS is a guide to develop promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields develop Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most 21            appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve. 3. Recommendations. Comments and recommendations concerning the quality of AETC training are welcomed. Information or questions regarding changes to training outlined in this CFETP should be addressed to: 81 TRG/TGET, 106 Phantom Dr, Suite 232, Keesler AFB, MS 39534-2037.   Additionally, a customer service information line (CSIL) has been installed for the supervisor’s convenience. The CSIL may be used to identify graduates who may have potential training deficiencies or who may have received training beyond the STS requirement.  For a quick response to problems, call the CSIL at DSN 597-4566, or e-mail the request to 81trgtget@keesler.af.mil at Keesler AFB.
