The  causes  for  suspension  and  debarment  delineated  in  Federal  Acquisition Regulation Subpart 9.4 are not exclusive to procurement fraud.  Thus, some matters may be referred  to  the  Suspending  and  Debarring  Official  that  have  no  connection  with  a procurement fraud investigation. 2.3.4.  Referrals  in  connection  with  a  significant  procurement  fraud  investigation  shall  be accompanied  by  a  remedies  plan  that  addresses  the  requested  administrative  remedy  (i.e., suspension or debarment).  Substantive resources regarding suspension and debarment,    AFI51-1101  19 OCTOBER 2017 9 including the Air Force Suspension and Debarment Case Law Compendium, can be found at the  SAF/GCR  intranet  site  on  the  Air  Force  Portal  at  https://www.my.af.mil.
