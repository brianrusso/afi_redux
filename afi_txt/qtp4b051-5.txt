Evaluate that the work area/shop’s written HAZCOM program has been prepared.1 2. Assess worker knowledge of basic HAZCOM concepts.2 3. Verify all elements of the HAZCOM program as outline in Chapter 3, AFI 90-821, have been implemented.3 4. Document training validation on AF 55, Employee Safety and Health Record.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: None  NOTES:  1.  Applies to only work area/shops which produce or use hazardous chemicals. Be sure to include the following in the evaluation: •  How SDSs are accessible to employees. •  Container labeling procedures and requirements. •  Training requirements and procedures. •  Chemical inventory requirements. •  Procedures for informing employees regarding hazards of non-routine tasks and unlabeled pipes. •  Procedures for determining the hazard of a chemical, if applicable1.   2.  Per AFI 90-821:  HAZCOM is a performance-based program and successful implementation can only be measured by evaluating worker awareness of work area/shop hazards. Assess the workers’ knowledge by asking them about the following: •  What processes and chemicals present hazards in their work area and the nature of the hazard(s). •  How to access SDSs for any chemical they use. •  How to find information on an SDS. •  How to interpret the hazard symbols/wording on hazard labels and what precautions (e.g., engineering controls, PPE, etc.) they must use when working with hazardous chemicals.   3.   Verification of implementation of all elements of the HAZCOM program include each of the following:  •  Validate that there is a current SDS for each potentially hazardous chemical in use and/or on hand in the shop. •  Validate all containers of hazardous chemicals are properly labeled. •  Confirm all elements of training are conducted as outlined in AFI 90-821, paragraphs 3.1.6 •  Confirm the shop’s chemical inventory lists every chemical in the shop. •  Confirm non-routine tasks are adequately documented.         2 AFQTP 4B051-5                                                                   Journeyman Training Guide:  Hazard Communication  TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS  STS Line Item 4.4.3:  Evaluate shop hazard communication (HAZCOM) programs 1.

What materials are exempt from HAZCOM? ANSWERS  A:  RCRA and CERCLA wastes, Tobacco, Wood, Articles, Food/beverages/cosmetics, drugs in final form, consumer products used in a consumer fashion,  Nuisance particulates,  radiation, Biological hazards, Munitions, Laboratories  (Source:  Career Development Course 4B051) 2.  What are the components of a written HAZCOM program? Inventory of hazardous chemicals. • •  Obtaining and maintaining Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). •  Labeling requirements for hazardous chemicals. •  Procedures for informing/protecting employees conducting non-routine tasks/jobs involving potentially  A:  A:   hazardous chemicals. •  Employee training. (Source:  Career Development Course 4B051)  3.  What must be included in worker training? • Identification of operations or processes (including non-routine processes) in the work area where hazardous chemicals are present or used. •  Location and details of the written hazard communication program, including the required list(s) of hazardous chemicals, and SDSs/MSDSs required by this section. •  Methods and observations that may be used to detect the presence or release of a hazardous chemical in the work area (such as monitoring conducted by the employer, continuous monitoring devices, visual appearance or odor of hazardous chemicals when being released, etc.) •  Physical and health hazards of the chemicals in the work area. •  Measures workers must take to protect themselves to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazardous chemicals, such as appropriate work practices, emergency procedures, and PPE to be used. •  Explanation of the labeling and SDS/MSDS systems, and how workers can obtain and use the appropriate chemical hazard information. •  Additional training on expanded standards (e.g., asbestos, benzene, lead, etc.) as required by OSHA.
