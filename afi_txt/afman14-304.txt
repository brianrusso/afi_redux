Host  base  SSO  responsibilities  are  not  to  cross  command  lines  of  authority  with respect  to  management  of  resources  (i.e.  manpower  and  funding).    Host  base  SSOs  will assess the condition and security of systems supplied to the tenant (i.e. Cyber security, IDS, Access  control)  (T-1).    MOAs  are  established  to  ensure  host  responsibilities  (i.e.  JWICS security controls) are met. 2.7.  Contractor  Special  Security  Officer  (CSSO).

(Exception:    For  overseas  locations,  the  appointed  SSR/CSSR  requires  18 months  remaining  on  station  (except  remote/deployed  locations)).    The  SSR/CSSR  will physically occupy the SCIF when operationally feasible (T-1). Figure 2.2.  SSR Appointment Letter. SAMPLE SSR APPOINTMENT LETTER MEMORANDUM FOR MAJCOM SSO  FROM:  SSR’s UNIT  SUBJECT:  Appointment of Special Security Representative (SSR)  1.  The below named individual(s) is/are appointed the SSR(s) for unit.  The SSR will be responsible for complying with the duties and responsibilities as described in DoDM 5105.21-V1 and as designated by the MAJCOM Special Security Office.  Primary: Rank/Name (Last, First MI)                                                            Duty Phone:  Alternate: Rank/Name (Last, First MI)                                                            Duty Phone:  2.  This memorandum supersedes any previous appointment letter.  3.  If you have any questions please contact POC.  SIO Signature Block  Note:  For contractor SSRs add a paragraph specifying if the appointed contractor SSR has been authorized to access/secure the SCIF. 14 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 2.8.1.  If  a  single  SSR  is  appointed  to  multiple  SCIFs,  the  commander/responsible  SIO submits a request to the supporting SSO, outlining the rationale for a single SSR supporting more than one SCIF.  All requests must: 2.8.1.1.  Justify the need for the SSR to serve as the appointed security official for more than one SCIF (T-1). 2.8.1.2.  Include cost and mission impacts if the waiver request is denied (T-1). 2.8.1.3.  Indicate  risk  management  measures  that  are  established  for  handling  SCI security management duties for multiple SCIFs on a daily basis (T-1). 2.8.1.4.  Identify the SCIFs involved and their proximity to one another within  the same building (T-1).  Requests are only considered for SCIFs in the same building. 2.8.1.5.  Staff  the  request  through  the  supporting  SSO  and  MAJCOM  SSO,  MAJCOM SIO is  the final  approval authority  (T-1).  MAJCOM SIO has discretion to  delegate the approval authority to the MAJCOM SSO. 2.8.2.  The appointed SSR does not perform SCI security duties for multiple SCIFs without the final approval of the MAJCOM SIO or delegated authority. 2.8.3.  A  single  SSR  supporting  multiple  SCIFs  is  considered  a  risk  and  requires  annual review  to  ensure  adherence  to  the  SCI  security  program  guidelines.    During  the  annual review,  if  the  program  functions  normally  without  incident,  then  the  approval  remains  in effect  until  the  next  annual  review.    However,  if  security  deviations  are  observed  and determined  to  be  a  result  of  this  management  style,  the  MAJCOM  SIO,  through  the MAJCOM  SSO,  makes  a  policy  revocation  determination  regarding  the  continuation  of approval.  If required, revocations are issued in writing to the cognizant SIO/SSO and SSR.  The  MAJCOM  SIO  may  withdraw  their  approval  granting  permission  for  a  single  SSR  to support multiple SCIFs at any time. 2.8.4.  SSRs  maintain  training  documentation  which  reflects  SCI  security  management training was completed.  Documentation includes the SSRs certification showing contractors are qualified to perform SCI security functions within the SCIF. 2.9.  Director,  Base  Medical  Service  .    In  the  event  an  SCI-indoctrinated  individual  require, physical  or  psychological  treatment  potentially  impacting  their  ability  to  perform  sensitive duties, the Director of Base Medical Service formally notifies the unit commander of proposed treatment(s).  Commanders coordinate with the SIO and SSO and make a determination whether to allow the person’s continued access to sensitive information). 2.10.  Defense Force Commander.  The Defense Force Commander will: 2.10.1.  Provide physical protection support for approved SCIFs IAW AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense,  Intelligence  Community  Technical  Specification  (IC  Tech  Spec)  Technical Specifications  for  Construction  and  Management  of  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information Facilities,  Version  1.3  Intelligence  Community  Standard  (ICS)  705-1,  Physical  and Technical  Security  Standards for  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facilities, Intelligence  Community  Standard  (ICS)  705-2,  Standards  for  the  Accreditation  and Reciprocal Use of Sensitive Compartmented Information, and this publication (T-0). AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 15 2.10.2.  Coordinate  with  unit  commanders  and  establish  procedures  for  security  teams  to respond  to  point  of  alarm  to  determine  if  it  is  hostile  or  non-hostile.    If  hostile  take appropriate actions to neutralize threats.  If non-hostile then establish cordon and protect until the  arrival  of  appropriately  SCI  cleared  responder  who  assess  the  situation  and  provide guidance (T-1). 2.10.3.  Allow  the  SIO,  SSO,  or  designated  representative  access  to  the  daily  blotter  to determine  which  entries  may  affect  the  continued  eligibility  of  SCI-indoctrinated  personnel or may affect the security of any SCIF area (T-1). 2.10.4.  Assists  owner/users  in  developing  Protection  Level  Designation  Matrix  (PLDM) recommendations to the Installation Commander to assign appropriate protection levels and ensure it is protected IAW AFI 31-101 (T-1). 2.11.  Base Civil Engineer.  The Base Civil Engineer will: 2.11.1.  Ensure all SCIF construction and/or modifications are coordinated with local CE and MAJCOM  SSO  prior  to  design  requests;  construction  or  modifications  to  facilities designated as SCIFs be IAW ICD 705 standards (T-0). 2.11.2.  Handle  requests  for  assistance  on  security-related  problems  in  SCIFs  on  a  priority basis (T-1). 2.11.3.  Ensure the request for SCI-level shielded enclosure includes the following (T-0): 2.11.3.1.  The  Committee  on  National  Security  Systems  Instruction  (CNSSI)  7000, TEMPEST Countermeasures for Facilities (C) analysis. 2.11.3.2.  The DIA/SEC Certified TEMPEST Technical Authority (CTTA) analysis. 2.11.3.3.  A letter or message from local SIO or SCI security official stating the shielded enclosure is necessary to maintain security of the proposed SCIF. 2.12.  Supporting Communications Element  .  The Supporting Communications Element will: 2.12.1.  Operate  and  maintain  dedicated  intelligence  communications  systems  to  provide timely intelligence communications support (T-1). 2.12.2.  Provide  Communications-Electronics communications according to the supported unit’s validated requirements (T-1). and  COMSEC programming for 2.12.3.  Appoint COMSEC officers and custodians (T-1). 2.12.4.  Provide resources, on a rapid response basis, to meet the needs for communications service during peak activities, catastrophes, or fluctuations in the intelligence mission (T-1)  These  resources  are  established  in  the  circuit  restoration  priority  list  or  other  authoritative source, such as a MAJCOM operations plan or local directive. 2.13.  Contractor  Personnel  Assigned  to  SSO.  Contractor  personnel  perform  SCI  personnel security  support  functions  (preparing  documents,  scheduling,  verifying  information,  giving  the indoctrination/debriefing  presentations,  etc.)  within  a  DoD  SCIF  only  under  the  direct supervision of a government employee or military person.  Contractor personnel in a SSO may perform  all  security  duties  as  assigned  by  the  SSO  and  outlined  in  the  Performance  of  Work Statement (PWS).  Contract personnel will NOT perform the following actions: 16 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 2.13.1.  Approve  an  indoctrination,  suspension,  debriefing,  nor  sign  as  a  person  accepting same on behalf the U. S. Government (T-1). 2.13.2.  Act  in  any  capacity  as  the  chief  of  personnel  security  or  perform  any  industrial security  functions  within  an  SSO.    Act  in  any  capacity  as  the  chief  or  primary  physical security manager for the SCIF to include decisions for building standards or funding issues (T-1). 2.13.3.  Accept  a  nondisclosure  agreement  (NdA)  or  nondisclosure  statement  (NdS)  for  the United States (US) Government (T-1). 2.13.4.  Conduct SCI screening interviews (T-1). 2.14.  Contract Personnel (not assigned to the  SSO).  Contract Personnel will: 2.14.1.  Conduct SCI security functions within their assigned SCIF (T-1). 2.14.2.  Satisfy  their  contractual  requirements  and  failure  to  resolve  disputes  over duties/responsibilities  will  result  in  removal  from  SCI  security  responsibilities  (T-1).  Contractual obligations normally take precedence unless they conflict with security or safety rules.    Conflicts  are  immediately  resolved  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  SSR,  CSSR,  SSO,  SIO and the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR). AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 17 CHAPTER 3 PERSONNEL SECURITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT 3.1.  Chapter  Overview.  This  chapter  details  processes  for  granting,  managing,  and  revoking individual access to SCI material. 3.2.  Joint  Personnel  Adjudication  System  (JPAS).  JPAS  is  the  DoD  personnel  security clearance  and  access  database.    MAJCOM  SSOs  follow  the  Parent  and  Affiliated  user  roles established  by  the  AF  CSA.    MAJCOM  SSO  manages  the  organizational  SCI  access  program through  JPAS  or  successor  systems  of  records  (example:  DISS)  and  as  well  as  any  locally created databases. 3.3.  Scattered Castles.  Due to special access requirements, not all IC Agencies use JPAS.  The IC implemented a secure method to validate and certify the security clearances and accesses of its  affiliated  personnel.    This  method  is  necessary  for  providing  additional  secure  and authenticated  clearance  verification  for  “Communities  of  Interest”  (COI).    A  COI  is  a  way  to protect  the  need-to-know  for  specific  information  by  limiting  it  to  those  individuals  who  have been previously approved to receive it.  The result of this program is the establishment of the IC Security  Clearance  Repository  (ICSCR),  or  more  commonly  referred  to  as  Scattered  Castles.  The  AF  CSA  is  the  Scattered  Castles  access  manager,  approving  authority,  and  serves  as  the Scattered Castles Executive Steering Group (SCESG) representative for the AF. 3.3.1.  MAJCOM SSOs or equivalent: 3.3.1.1.  Nominate  their  subordinates  for  Scattered  Castles  access  via  JWICS  e-mail  to A2ZS.workflow@af.ic.gov. 3.3.1.2.  Maintain  a  list  of  their  designated  Scattered  Castles  users  and  notify  AF  CSA when a designated user no longer requires Scattered Castles access or is  debriefed from SCI access. 3.3.2.  The  AF  CSA  starts  the  access  approval  process  and  contacts  the  nominee  with  the required information to complete the Scattered Castles access registration. 3.4.  Department  of  Defense  (DD)  Form  1847-1,  SCI  Nondisclosure  Statements  (NDS).  During a member's initial SCI indoctrination the SSO uses the most current DD Form 1847-1 in addition to the federal statutes memorandum.  As a condition of access to SCI, all AF personnel must sign DD Form 1847-1, SCI Nondisclosure Statement (NdS) that has a provision conforming to  two  Federal  statutes:    the  Financial  Services  and  General  Government  Appropriations  Act (Public Law 112-74); and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act (WPEA) (Public Law 112-199) (T-1). 3.4.1.  The AF/A2 is responsible for retaining in a retrievable manner the original NdS for at least  70  years  or  until  the  death  of  the  individual.    The  AF  retains  NdS  records  on  AF military, civilians and contractor personnel. 3.4.2.  It  is  AF  and  DoD  policy  to  use  the  most  current  DD    Form  1847-1  (NDS)  attached with  the  Federal  statutes  for  AF  personnel  the  first  time  an  individual  is  indoctrinated  into SCI.  The SSO completes the DD Form 1847-1 and updates JPAS.  If JPAS reflects an NDS date there is no need to re-accomplish the NDS or enter a new date into JPAS. 18 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 3.4.2.1.  All  newly  completed    DD  Form  1847-1  are  scanned  and  maintained  as  the official  AF  record.   Only  new indoctrinations without an NdS  on  file (check JPAS) are sent to the servicing SSO’s MAJCOM.  The following steps are taken: 3.4.2.1.1.  Scan both sides of DD Form 1847-1 (keep each record separate). 3.4.2.1.2.  Use NDS_MAJCOM_YEAR_LAST  NAME_FIRST  NAME_MIDDLE (example: nds_haf_2014_eason_marcus_a. pdf). following the file naming convention:  INTIAL 3.4.2.2.  MAJCOM  SSOs  will  send  command’s  electronic  NdS  to  the  AF  CSA  for retention  and  nominate  command’s  points  of  contact  to  AF  CSA  for  access  to  the  NdS SharePoint site (T-1). 3.4.2.3.  The  IC  Form  4414  is  used  for  the  indoctrination  into  the  HUMINT  Control System  (HCS)  and  available  on  the  ODNI  National  Counter  Intelligence  Executive (NCIX)  Security  Executive  Agent’s (SECEA)  website  on  NIPR  Net  at http://www.ncix.gov/sea/index.php (all lower case). 3.5.  Standard  Form  (SF)  312,  Nondisclosure  Agreements  (NdA).    All  AF  SCI  security officials  review  collateral  clearance  levels,  and  NdA  date  in  JPAS  prior  to  performing  SCI indoctrinations or requesting indoctrination assistance from other security officials.  Individuals whose  JPAS  records  do  not  reflect  the  required  information  are  not  indoctrinated  until  the collateral  portion of their JPAS  record is  updated.  JPAS is updated by the unit conducting the briefings.  Refer to AFI 16-1404, Air Force Information Security Program, for NdA disposition instructions. 3.6.  Indoctrination  to SCI  .  Prior to SCI indoctrination the individual’s eligibility is verified and a SCI Screening Interview, if required, is accomplished.  Use a DD Form 1847 or IC Form 4414 to document SCI indoctrination. 3.6.1.  Eligibility.  SCI Security Officials use JPAS and/or Scattered Castles to determine if an individual is eligible for SCI indoctrination.  The SIO may authorize indoctrination only after  verification  of  eligibility  and  the  need-to-know  is  established.    Refer  to  ICD  704, Personnel  Security  Standards  and  Procedures  Governing  Eligibility  for  Access  to  SCI,  for detailed requirements regarding SCI eligibility. 3.6.1.1.  SSOs  accept  SSBIs,  SSBI  Periodic  Reinvestigations  (SSBI-PR)  and  Phased Periodic Reinvestigations (PPR) less than five years old as being “in-scope” and the basis for  initial  or  continued  access  to  SCI  for  visiting  personnel.    Upon  reviewing  an investigation  more  than  five  years  old  but  less  than  seven  years  old,  the  receiving  SSO will check JPAS to ensure an investigation is initiated and annotated in the record for the individual to remain “In-Scope.”  When the investigation is not annotated, the receiving SSO  ensures  that  a  periodic  review  is  initiated  by  the  owning  organization.    If  an investigation  has  NOT  been  initiated  the  “in-scope”  status  does  not  apply  and  access  is not granted. 3.6.1.2.  An  investigations  over  the  seven  year  anniversary  date  are  considered  out  of scope  regardless  of  investigation  status  and  access  is  not  be  granted.    AF  CSA  may extend  past  the  7  year  mark  "in-scope"  for  instances  where  the  open  SSBI/PR  has  not AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 19 closed.    The  MAJCOM SSO  justify  the  continued  access  to  SCI  in  writing.    AF  CSA's approval memo will not exceed one year for visits. 3.6.1.3.  MAJCOM  SSOs  have  the  authority  to  accept  the  current  SCI  status  (read-in caveats) pending the start of an overdue investigation with the acceptance of risk after the review of a current SF86. 3.6.2.  SCI  Pre-Screening  Interview.    The  nominated  individual  completes  a  private  pre-screening interview covering the period since the completion of the last investigation (Single Scope  Background  Investigation  (SSBI)  or  Periodic  Reinvestigation  (PR))  to  assure  they continued to meet the ICD 704 standards.  SCI pre-screening interviews are accomplished in a private face-to-face setting and require the completion of the SCI pre-screening interview (Attachment  2).    Interviewee  provides  a  narrative  explanation  for  all  "yes"  answers  in  the additional  comments  section  of  Attachment  2.    If  an  interviewee  declines  to  provide  such information,  interviewer  documents  this  in  the  additional  comments  section.    Failure  to explain  “yes”  answers  slow  the  adjudicative  process,  delay  access,  and  could  lead  to  the denial of access. 3.6.2.1.  When the SCI screening results disclose information potentially disqualifying an individual  from  receiving  access  to  SCI,  at  the  commander’s  discretion  a  Security Information File (SIF) may be established IAW AFI 31-501. 3.6.2.2.  Applicants have the option to withdraw from the screening process at any time but are not indoctrinated for SCI prior to adjudication. 3.6.3.  Post-Government  employment  reporting.    Post-Government  employment  reporting applies to individuals who occupy AF covered positions to report employment with foreign government  entities  (hereafter  referred  to  as  “covered  employment”)  for  two  years  after separation from the DAF. 3.6.3.1.  Post-Government  employment  reporting  requirements  apply to  positions associated to SCI accesses and implements Title 50 U.S.C. Section 3073a.  SSOs provide Attachment  3,  Post-Government  Employment  by  Holders  of  SCI  Access,  to  the appropriate  employee  during  SCI  in-brief  and  debrief.    (Note:    For  purposes  of  this requirement all personnel assigned to 25th AF and its subordinate units, to include AFR units associated with 25th AF are assigned to an ISR organization.)  AF Element of the IC ; consist of those Active Duty, AFR, ANG, and DAF Civilians employees who fit one or more of the following categories: 3.6.3.1.1.  Awarded a 14N or 1N Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) (military); 3.6.3.1.2.  Assigned to a 0132 - job series (civilians); 3.6.3.1.3.  Assigned  to  a  Defense  Civilian  Intelligence  Professional  System  (GG), Defense  Intelligence  Senior  Executive  Service  (DISES),  or  Defense  Intelligence Senior Leader (DISL) billet (civilians); 3.6.3.1.4.  Assigned  to  an  AF  ISR  organization,  including  appointees  from  other agencies (excluding Contractors); 3.6.3.1.5.  Assigned to AFOSI. 20 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 3.6.3.2.  The  AF/A2  CSA  consults  with  appropriate  security  and  counterintelligence authorities to conduct a risk assessment and recommend mitigation upon receiving notice from any employee involving employment with a foreign government entity. 3.6.3.3.  SSOs retain  the signed form   in  the employee’s Personnel  Security  Folder, and dispose  of  them  IAW  rule  applying  to  the  in-brief  and  debrief  form.    SSO  provides  a copy of the form to employee completing them on request. 3.6.3.4.  An  employee  currently  indoctrinated  into  SCI  and  in  the  position  listed  above, SSOs ensure the employee completes the form letter within 180 days (T-1). 3.7.  Access to HCS, with Interim SCI Eligibility.  All the SCI access requirements in ICD 704 and  Intelligence  Community  Policy  Guidance  (ICPG)  704.1,  Personnel  Security  Investigative Standards  and  Procedures  Governing  Eligibility  for  Access  to  Sensitive  Compartmented Information and Other Controlled Access Program Information, apply to HCS access. 3.7.1.  Before  an  individual  with  interim  SCI  access  is  considered  for  indoctrination  into HCS Programs the SSO ensures: 3.7.1.1.  An open Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) 3.7.1.2.  A favorable SCI Screening Interview; and be granted interim SCI access by the DoD CAF.  Exception:  Technical training students with interim SCI eligibility exempt from submission of the formal waiver requirement to access HCS. 3.7.1.3.  When  all  conditions  are  met,  the  responsible  security  official  through  their MAJCOM SSO requests indoctrination approval from the AF CSA by email through the AF/A2ZS (usaf.pentagon.af.a2.mbx.af-A2ZS-workflow@mail.mil).    Access  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum,  pending  final  clearance adjudication. workflow email address 3.7.2.  Indoctrinating  interim  SCI  individuals  into  HCS  may  not  automatically  grant  the individual access to all the IC databases needed.  Certain IC database accesses are controlled by  Scattered  Castles  and  do  not  recognize  interim  SCI  eligibility  as  a  proper  clearance.    In this  case,  the  SSO  needs  to  contact  the  database  point  of  contact  (POC)  to  develop  a workaround for individual access. 3.7.3.  Document  HCS  indoctrination  using  forms  DD  Form  1847  or  IC  Form  4414.  (Exception:    When  an  owning  organization  requests  indoctrination  assist  the  accepting organization should follow the requesting organizations policies and use the form identified in the request.) 3.8.  KLONDIKE  Control  Systems  (KCS).  All requests for KCS access, indoctrinations, and debriefings are channeled through the MAJCOM SSO.  The MAJCOM SSO contacts  AF CSA for detail instructions.  KCS security incidents must be reported to AF CSA (T-0). 3.9.  Special Circumstances 3.9.1.  Temporary/Interim  Eligibility  for  Access  to  SCI.    Temporary  eligibility  is  needed when a commander has determined there is a justified requirement for access to SCI and an individual  does  not  have  the  required  investigation  (SSBI)  completed  and  favorably adjudicated.    Temporary  eligibility  may  be  considered  when  the  individual  has  a  favorable National Agency Check/National Agency Check plus Written Inquiries and credit check plus AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 21 Single Scope Background Investigation Requested along with an open SSBI that is  running favorably (NACS).  If unfavorable information is discovered, temporary access is withdrawn.  Individuals granted temporary eligibility is advised during the indoctrination their continued access is contingent upon favorable adjudication of the background investigation.  A request for the temporary  eligibility is  forwarded through the MAJCOM SSO to the DoD CAF via JPAS.    MAJCOM  SSOs  may  delegate  authority  to  their  subordinates  as  necessary.    The request indicates the individual’s SF 86 was favorably reviewed by the requester.  Conduct a pre-screening  interview  when  temporary  eligibility  to  SCI  is  required  pending  completion and  adjudication  of  the  SSBI.    Attachment  2  contains  an  example  of  an  SCI  pre-screening interview.    Temporary  eligibility  requests  should  be  unclassified.    Interim  SCI  requests  are submitted through JPAS and the Clearance Adjudication Tracking System (CATS). 3.9.2.  SCI Eligibility for Training Attendance. 3.9.2.1.  Airmen  selected  for  career/AFSC  follow-on  training  or  retraining  into  a  new AFSC  may  require  SCI  eligibility  as  a  prerequisite  when  applying  for  or  prior  to  being assigned a class date.  The Airman’s current or losing local SSO and/or MAJCOM SSO processes  the  SCI  eligibility  request  when  this  pre-requisite  exists,  regardless  of  the current AFSC, duty assignment or associated clearance requirements.  When processing the request to the DoD CAF, the SSO and/or SIO cite the future training course or AFSC retraining selection as the justification criteria. 3.9.2.2.  Airmen should not depart for training until JPAS reflects the required interim or final  SCI  eligibility  by  the  DoD  CAF.    SCI  indoctrination  is  not  necessary  prior  to  the individual’s departure for the training location unless an indoctrination assist is requested by the training site SSO. 3.9.3.  Access  by  Retired  General/Flag  Officers  and  Former  Senior  DoD  Officials.    The Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SecAF),  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Air  Force  (CSAF),  MAJCOM commanders  (MAJCOM/CC)  or  Headquarters  AF  two  letter  Directors  may  request  the Administrative  Assistant  to  the  SecAF  (SAF/AA)  approve  sponsorship  for  access  to classified information  for a retired general officer, Senior Executive Service (SES) member or former Presidential appointees to support a specific AF program or mission.  Refer to AFI 31-501,  for  procedures  to  get  clearance  eligibility.    After  SAF/AA  approves  sponsorship, AF/A2  may  grant  SCI  access  to  retired  General/Flag  Officers  and  former  senior  DoD officials in DoD-sponsored events when their expertise is vital. 3.9.3.1.  Request  is  sent  to  the  AF  CSA  and  they  approve  the  access  unless  there  is disqualifying  information.    If  there  is  disqualifying  information,  the  AF  CSA  forwards the package to the AF/A2 for approval/disapproval. 3.9.3.2.  The request includes the following information: 3.9.3.2.1.  Visitor’s Name. 3.9.3.2.2.  Social Security Account Number (SSAN). 3.9.3.2.3.  Sponsor’s Name (General Officer or SES). 3.9.3.2.4.  Date Access Required (maximum of one year). 3.9.3.2.5.  Verification  of  ICD  704  standards  (include  any  information  potentially disqualifying). 22 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 3.9.3.2.6.  Justification of “Need-to-Know”. 3.9.3.2.7.  Statement stating visitor is not afforded any competitive advantage through material released to him/her. 3.9.3.2.8.  Statement stating SAF/AA granted clearance eligibility on “DATE”. 3.9.4.  Special  Purpose  Access  (SPA).    Individuals  occasionally  require  access  to  SCI  to perform  a  specific  task.    The  local  SIO  may  grant  access,  for  consecutive  periods  of  180 days, not to exceed one year.  The SPA is approved based on the criticality of the need-to-know  and  a  favorable  ICD  704  eligibility  determination  from  the  DoD  CAF  as  entered  in JPAS and/or Scattered Castles.  Conduct a SCI screening interview (Attachment 2) to ensure no  disqualifying  information  is  present.    Upon  approval,  the  individual  is  be  given  an indoctrination briefing which includes the basic information to protect SCI.  The individual signs an NdS and be indoctrinated for the appropriate SCI access. Records of indoctrination for  SPA  include  specific  date  of  automatic  debrief  from  SCI  access.    Extensions  are requested and approved before automatic debrief date. 3.9.5.  Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Employees.  IPA employees are typically non-federal organization employees on temporary loan to the Federal Government for a specified period of time.  IPAs requiring SCI access follow the same procedures for obtaining access as  government  employees.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  IPA  supervisor  to  initiate  the security  clearance/access  process  when  an  IPA  requires  SCI  access  for  performing  their duties outlined in the IPA Agreement. 3.9.5.1.  The  IPA  Agreement.    The  IPA  Agreement  typically  consists  of  an  Optional Form  (OF)  69,  Assignment  Agreement,  with  addendums  addressing  legal  issues,  costs, and other documentation required as part of the  hiring process.    If an  IPA requires SCI access,  the  OF  69,  (Part  7,  Paragraph  22)  states  TS/SCI  access  is  required  for accomplishment  of  IPA  duties.    When  requesting  SCI  access  for  an  IPA,  the  following documents will be included with the IPA agreement (T-1): 3.9.5.1.1.  The IPA SCI Addendum. 3.9.5.1.2.  Justification for “SI/TK” access. 3.9.5.1.3.  Justification for “G” access (if needed). 3.9.5.1.4.  Justification for “HCS” access (if needed). 3.9.5.2.  “Detailed” IPAs are the most common type employed by the AF within an SCI environment.  Detailed IPAs are not government employees nor are they considered to be defense  contractors.    They  are  merely  considered  “IPAs”  when  described  with  that designation. 3.9.6.  Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) SCI Access. 3.9.6.1.  The SAB is a group of the nation’s top civilian scientists from industry, national labs,  Federally  Funded  Research  and  Development  Centers  (FFRDCs),  academia  and government brought together to perform AF related studies at the behest of the Secretary of  the  Air  Force  (SecAF).    All  members  are  nominated  by  the  SecAF,  approved  by  the White  House  Liaison  Office  and  appointed  by  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (SecDef)  as AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 23 Special Government Employees (SGE).  The SAB secretariat creates a civilian category in JPAS for all approved members. 3.9.6.2.  Once  sworn  in  as  a  SAB  member  SSO  AFDW  (AF  District  of  Washington) receives  SCI  indoctrination  request  from  the  SAB  secretariat  for  all  members  requiring SCI access.  SSO AFDW: 3.9.6.2.1.  Takes an owning relationship in JPAS with their SCI SMO (SSOAFDW2) under  member’s  civilian  category  (if  possible)  and  review  JPAS  and  or  scattered castles for eligibility determination. 3.9.6.2.2.  If  eligibility  determination  cannot  be  made  (i.e.,  upgrade  eligibility required) SSO AFDW requests a Request to Research/Upgrade (RRU) through JPAS to  upgrade members eligibility level.   Once eligibility is  granted SSO AFDW either indoctrinates  member  or  request  indoctrination  assistance  to  have  members indoctrinated  at  location  closest  to  where  member  resides.    Once  SSO  AFDW receives indoctrination package JPAS civilian category is updated. 3.9.6.2.3.  If a member already meets eligibility requirements, SSO AFDW approves the  member  for  SCI  indoctrination  and,  if  required,  submit  indoctrination  assistance to have the member indoctrinated at a location closest to where they reside. 3.9.6.2.4.  If member is already indoctrinated into SCI access with another SSO as a civilian  or  contractor  SSO  AFDW  makes  every  attempt  to  obtain  a  copy  of indoctrination  paperwork  to  hold  in  order  to  support  SAB  efforts.    If  currently indoctrinated  as  a  civilian  SSO  AFDW  takes  a  servicing  relationship  with  member and  pass  SCI  in  support  of  SAB  business  only.    If  currently  indoctrinated  as  a contractor, SCI accesses and JPAS ownership is to be placed in civilian category. 3.9.6.3.  All  regular  component  officers  or  reserve  officers  not  permanently  assigned  to SAB  secretariat  but  have  been  identified  by  the  SAB  as  filling  a  temporary  executive officers or technical writer’s role are processed through SSO AFDW.  SSO AFDW: 3.9.6.3.1.  Verifies current eligibility status using JPAS or Scattered Castles. 3.9.6.3.2.  Takes a servicing role in JPAS and permanently certify those accesses for support  to  SAB,  if  the  regular  component  officers  or  reserve  officer  is  already indoctrinated.    If  additional  accesses  are  required,  SSO  AFDW  contacts  the  owning SSO for permission to indoctrinate into additional accesses. 3.9.6.3.3.  Receives  a  special  purpose  access  request  from  the  SAB  secretariat  on  a regular  component  officer  or  reserve  officer  that  are  not  already  indoctrinated  into SCI.  Once DOD CAF approval is granted for SCI indoctrination, SSO AFDW either indoctrinates  the  member  or  process  an  indoctrination  assistance  to  have  member briefed at the local SSO.  Once SSO AFDW receives the indoctrination package, the appropriate JPAS category is updated. 3.9.6.3.4.  Administratively  debriefs,  no  later  than  15  Oct  of  each  year,  all  regular component officer or reserve officers temporarily supporting the SAB.  This applies only members owned by SSO AFDW.  If ownership exists with another government SSO, SSO AFDW does not administratively debrief. 24 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 3.9.6.4.  When contractors participate in  the SAB as Subject  Matter Experts (SME), the SSO  holding  their  access  permanently  certifies  the  accesses  to  SSO  AFDW  with  a request to recertify as required, not to exceed one year. 3.10.  Reporting Derogatory Information. 3.10.1.  In  addition  to  requiring  self-reporting  of  information  affecting  SCI  eligibility, SSOs/CSSOs  maintain  effective  liaison  with  supervisory  personnel,  local  police  agencies, and,  consistent  with  applicable  health  care  laws  and  regulations,  medical  authorities  to identify  as  early  as  possible  potential  security  problems  involving  SCI-indoctrinated personnel.    The  DoD  CAF  retains  authority  to  suspend  an  individual’s  eligibility  based  on information gained during adjudication or information reported by the field. 3.10.2.  Security  Information  File  (SIF).    A  SIF  is  a  collection  of  documents  established when  derogatory  information  becomes  known  and  may  impact  an  individual’s  continued eligibility  to  hold  SCI  access  and/or  a  security  clearance.    A  SIF  is  established  by  a commander, a civilian equivalent, or the DoD CAF.  Formal notification to the individual (in writing)  is  mandatory;  once  notification  is  complete  the  individual  formally  acknowledges (in writing) the SIF has been established.  Once formally established, only the DoD CAF has closure authority.  Refer to AFI 31-501, for SIF contents. 3.10.2.1.  Military and Government Employees.  If the SIF is locally established, the SSO notifies the DoD CAF, via approved channels; and the subject’s parent MAJCOM SSO.  If the SIF is DoD CAF established, the SSO notifies the subject’s parent MAJCOM SSO. 3.10.2.2.  Contractors/Consultants.  If the SIF is locally established, the SSO notifies the DoD CAF, via approved channels; the MAJCOM SSO with security cognizance for the contract, the COR and the company Facility Security Officer (FSO).  If the SIF is DoD CAF  established,  the  SSO  notifies  the  MAJCOM  SSO  with  security  cognizance  for  the contract,  the  COR  and  the  company  Facility  Security  Officer  (FSO).  (Note:  Due  to privacy  restrictions,  the  FSO  is  informed  only  of  the  establishment  of  the  SIF  and,  if applicable,  suspension  of  access  to  classified  information.)    The  FSO  is  advised  to contact their employee for details regarding the incident. 3.11.  Unauthorized Absences. 3.11.1.  Military Members.  If a military member is not present for duty and currently has or has  had  access  to  TOP  SECRET,  SCI,  or  special  access  information  then  refer  to  AFI  36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence, for member disposition.  If the military member is  classified  as  a  deserter  IAW  AFI  36-2911  immediately:    establish  a  SIF;  suspend  the member’s  access  to  all  classified  information;  and  if  the  member  had  access  to  Special Access  Programs  (SAP)  or  programs  utilizing  Alternative  or  Compensatory  Control Measures  (ACCM)  notify  the  appropriate  program  security  official  within  24  hours  of  the suspension. 3.11.2.  Civilian  and  Contractor  Personnel.  For  personnel  with  SCI  access  who  are  absence without authorization and lack of accountability of civilian or contractor personnel with SCI access  for a 24-hour period (1 day); or have  gone to/stayed in  a foreign country, and while there, has asked for, or taken any type of asylum, or resident permit from that country, or its governmental agencies, should accomplish the following.  Establish a SIF, suspend access to all  classified  information,  and  if  the  individual  had  access  to  SAPs  or  programs  utilizing AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 25 ACCMs, notify the appropriate program security official within 24 hours of the suspension.  For  contractor  personnel,  notify  both  the  COR  and  the  company  Facility  Security  Officer (FSO) of SIF establishment and all suspensions. 3.12.  Missing Personnel. 3.12.1.  For  all  indoctrinated  personnel  killed,  captured/missing  in  action,  absent  without leave, or considered a deserter the MAJCOM SSO will report to the AF CSA within 24 hours if personnel currently have or had SCI access within the last three years (T-1). 3.12.2.  If an individual is reported missing, unit commanders notify their SSR to begin the process to check if that individual had SCI access within the last three years. 3.12.2.1.  The unit Security Manager (SM) checks in JPAS to see if the subject is eligible for SCI access and if eligible, up-channel to the responsible SSO. 3.12.2.2.  The responsible SSO verify SCI access, i.e., checking JPAS, Scattered Castles, calling prior unit, etc.  If SCI access is verified, report the incident to the AF CSA within 24 hours.  The report includes a summary of information the individual had access to and their full name, rank and SSN. 3.13.  Incident  Reports.  Incident  reports  are  completed  and  submitted  via  JPAS  and  Case Adjudication  Tracking  System  (CATS).    Submitting  an  incident  report  via  JPAS  and  CATS automatically  initiate  a  SIF  if  one  was  not  already  established.    The  DoD  CAF  is  the  only organization authorized to close a SIF or remove it from JPAS/CATS. 3.14.  Appeals  Process/Due  Process.  Procedures  are  contained  in  AFI  31-501.    Due  process packages  for  a  contractor  is  be  handled  by  the  servicing  SSO  who  coordinates  with  the  COR before  presenting  the  information  to  the  individual  and  informing  the  FSO.    Note:    Due  to privacy  restrictions,  the  FSO  is  informed  only  that  an  appeal  or  due-process-action  is  initiated.  The  FSO  is  advised  to  contact  their  employee  for  details  on  these  matters.    The  SSO  consults with  their servicing Staff Judge Advocate on the matter for additional  guidance on minimizing AF  or  DoD  liability.    The  subject  forwards  any  rebuttal  or  appeal  to  the  servicing  SSO  for forwarding to  the DoD  CAF.  When a member  elects  to  appeal  DoD CAF clearance  eligibility revocation,  the  SSO  tracks  the  status  of  the  appeal  package.    Thirty  days  after  package  is returned to  the DoD CAF, SSO, thru the MAJCOM SSO and AF/A2ZS, requests confirmation that the package is in the possession of Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  The SSO  advises  the  member  and  the  respective  commander  once  confirmation  is  received.  PSAB/DOHA process may take 7 - 9 months for complete, depending on DOHA's workload and complexity of the individual cases.  DOHA's decision is provided to the DoD CAF and placed in JPAS as the system of record. 3.15.  Personal  Status  Changes  .    Administrative  changes  in  status  (e.g.,  name  change, relocation, etc.) are not reported to the DoD CAF.  SCI indoctrinated personnel will: 3.15.1.  Provide advance written notification within 5 duty days to the servicing SSO when they who decided to marry or to cohabitate with a foreign national and those who intend to enter into a relationship potentially creating a heightened risk of manipulation, blackmail, or coercion (T-1). 3.15.2.  Provide written notification to the servicing SSO when they: 3.15.2.1.  Change Marital Status or Cohabitation other than previously stated. (T-1). 26 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 3.15.2.2.  Significantly change their financial status such as sudden affluence (receipt of $10,000  or  more  from  a  source  other  than  a  pay  raise/promotion)  or  financial  distress (foreclosure  or  short  sale  of  real  estate,  accounts  sent  to  collection,  repossessions,  etc.). Note:  A Personal Financial Statement (PFS) is completed in cases of financial distress.  Refer to Figure 3.1, Personal Financial Statement.  A commander or SSO may require a PFS if they have reason to believe an individual is experiencing financial problems to the extent eligibility for access to classified information may be called into question (T-0). 3.15.2.3.  Experience other significant changes.  Significant changes include, but are not limited to; arrest by any law enforcement agency; imposition of a restraining order or a “no contact” order by any  civilian court; traffic violations which carry a fine/penalty  of $300 or more (not including court costs) or in which alcohol or drugs are involved even if not yet adjudicated.  The commander may establish a SIF IAW AFI 31-501, when results disclose  information  potentially  disqualifying  an  individual  from  receiving  SCI  access eligibility (T-1). Figure 3.1.

PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT FOR THE PERSONAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT AUTHORITY:  Executive Order numbers 9397, 10450, 11905, 12065; Intelligence Community Directive 704.  PURPOSE:  To enable member to submit a personal financial statement for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access adjudication.  Used only by the SCI approval authority to assist in determining the member’s eligibility for access to SCI.  ROUTINE USES:  None  DISCLOSURE IS VOLUNTARY:  Failure to provide the necessary information will result in the denial of SCI access eligibility Note:  If the commander makes a determination that a SIF is established due to financial consideration, the PFS should be part of the SIF package provided to the DoD CAF.  (The SSO ensures a statement is added at the end of the PFS to indicate the individual has reviewed the PFS and certifies the data is correct prior to sending). 3.15.3.  All  written  statements  collected  are  forwarded  by  the  SSO  to  the  member’s  parent MAJCOM  SSO/SIO  to  determine  if  the  situation  is  likely  to  pose  an  unacceptable  risk  to national  security.    This  determination  is  based  on  the  value  afforded  to  US  Government national  security  interests  by  the  individual  having  continued  access  to  SCI  exceeding  the associated  risks  of  the  relationship.    A  record  of  the  evaluation  is  kept  locally.    The evaluation includes such factors as: 28 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 3.15.3.1.  The  potential  for  a  foreign  power  to  exert  influence  over  the  intended spouse/cohabitant/roommate or immediate family members. 3.15.3.2.  The possibility that ties to any foreign government exist. 3.15.3.3.  Involvement in criminal activity. 3.15.3.4.  Support for the overthrow of the US Government. 3.15.4.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  evaluation  the  local  commander  and  SIO  determine  if access suspension is warranted or if a Standard Form (SF) 86C, Special Agreement Check, is required. 3.15.5.  Failure  to  provide  proper  notification  requires  initiation  of  a  Security  Information File  including,  but  not  limited  to,  all  information  shown  in  Figure  3.2,  Intent  to  Marry  or Cohabitate with a Non-US Citizen. Figure 3.2.  Intent to Marry or Cohabitate with a Non-US Citizen. INTENT TO MARRY OR COHABITATE WITH A NON-US CITIZEN NOTIFICATION CLASSIFICATION (as required, but a minimum of UNCLAS//FOUO)  FROM:  LOCAL SSO  TO:  MAJCOM/SSO  SUBJECT:  (Rank, Name, SSAN) Intent to Marry/Cohabitate with a Foreign National  1.  Statement of intent to marry/cohabitate: a.  Name, address, citizenship and vocation of intended spouse/co-habitant and his or her immediate family members. b.

Note:  May be via Message or JWICS E-mail. 3.15.6.  If required, the SSO has the member complete the Single Agency Check (SAC) and then route it through appropriate channels. 3.16.  Travel.  JPAS is the repository for unofficial foreign travel and SSOs ensure all unofficial foreign travel is added into JPAS.  Each MAJCOM SSO establishes procedures for documenting official foreign travel for their MAJCOM, unless Intelligence Community Policy Memorandum 2007-700-3,  Director  of  National  Intelligence  Foreign  Travel  Reporting  Form,  Paragraph  D.3, applies.  Any unusual incidents occurring during official or unofficial travel is reported to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) through the local SSO within 72 hours of return. AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 29 3.17.  Transfer-In-Status  (TIS).  TIS  actions are authorized for operational  necessities.  It  may be  requested  by  either  a  losing  or  gaining  SSO,  however,  the  gaining  SSO  ultimately  approve and accept the TIS action.  Exception:  Students attending Air Command and Staff College and Air War College automatically are TIS'd to SSO AU.  All paperwork associated to the original indoctrination is made available to the gaining organization. 3.17.1.  If  requested,  the  losing  SSO  scans  and  electronically  send  the  signed  NdS  to  the gaining SSO. 3.17.2.  Once  the  TIS  is  completed,  the  individual  in-processes  with  the  gaining  SSO  to receive the security awareness training. 30 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SECURITY 4.1.  Chapter  Overview.  This  chapter  covers  methods  used  to  ensure  access  to  Intelligence Community  (IC)  classification  management  and  control  markings  system,  which  provides  the framework  for  accessing,  classifying,  disseminating,  and  declassifying  intelligence  and intelligence-related  information  to  protect  sources,  methods,  activities.    Refer  to  ICD  710, Classification  Management  and  Control  Markings  System,  for  further  guidance.    For  IC classification  management  and  control  markings  system  AF  personnel  follow  the  latest Intelligence Community Markings System Register and Manual. 4.2.  HUMINT  Control  System  (HCS)  Information.  HCS  marking  is  marked  HCS-P (Product)  and  HCS-O  (Operations).    In  cases  where  the  SIO  determines  mission  requirements cannot be met using mail groups for dissemination of HCS, HCS e-mails may be sent desktop-to-desktop  over  appropriately  authorized  networks  between  HCS  indoctrinated  individuals  within the AF and under the security cognizance of the AF HICE.  It remains the sender’s responsibility to  verify  the  recipient  of  HCS  information  has  been  indoctrinated  for  HCS  and  has  a  need-to-know.    E-mails  containing  HCS  information  is  appropriately  marked  and  the  subject  line indicates the e-mail contains HCS materials. (ORCON) Information.  ORCON to  subordinate  units  without  advanced  permission  from 4.3.  Originator  Controlled designated  material disseminated  to  an  AF  headquarters  may  be  released  within  the  headquarters  and  further disseminated the  originating organization.  This includes release to the recipient organization’s contractors operating within a government  facility.    AF  headquarters  with  staff  elements  and  subordinate  units  with  recurring requirements for ORCON information should notify the originating agency so these elements can be  included  as  direct  recipients  of  ORCON  intelligence  information.    Refer  to  ICPG  710.1, Application  of  Dissemination  Controls:  Originator  Control  (ORCON),  for  further  guidance.  ICPG  710.1,  Sections  D.9  and  F.1.c.(1)  is  the  standard  criteria  for  IC  ORCON  Training.  ORCON training addresses the proper use, application, safeguarding, process for dissemination, and derivative use of the ORCON marking. 4.4.  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization JWICS Systems.  SSO/Information  System  Security  Manager  (ISSM)  ensures  the  following  IAW  DIA Installation  Guide,  Approval  Process  For  Handling  NATO  Classified  on  JWICS  Subnets,”  and AFI 16-1404. (NATO)  Classified on 4.4.1.  As  a  minimum  all  JWICS  users  are  briefed  with  the  AF  NATO  Security  Awareness Briefing    and  sign  the  AF  NATO  Security  Awareness  Acknowledgement  prior  to    access onto JWICS.  The NATO security awareness briefing and acknowledgement letter is used for individuals  that  require  access  to  a  classified  system,  but  do  not  require  daily  access  to NATO information.  Acknowledgement letters are kept in the individuals Personnel Security File as long as the individual has access to JWICS.  Both the briefing and acknowledgement letter can be found on the AF Portal: SAF/AAZ, AF NATO Security Awareness page. 4.4.2.  JWICS systems and subnets required to handle NATO classified are authorized by the AO to process NATO classified information.  The authorization memo states NATO Secret is approved to be processed on the system/network. AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 31 4.4.3.  All  JWICS  systems  authorized  to  process  NATO  classified  information  are  properly marked.    Consult  the  DIA  Instruction  Guide,  “Approval  Process  for  Handling  NATO Classified Information on JWICS Subnets, Paragraph 2 or the local SSO for proper marking. 4.4.4.  Refer  to  AFI  31-406  for  storage,  protection  and  transmission  and  report  incidents involving NATO classified information on JWICS. 4.4.5.  Information  Protection  Offices  are  the  primary  office  of  responsibility  for  NATO briefings.    SSOs  only  brief  personnel  into  NATO  information  awareness  for  JWICS  users when the local IP requests the assistance. 4.4.6.  Contractor access to NATO information is permitted.  All contractors that have access to JWICS are briefed with the AF NATO Security Awareness Briefing and sign the security awareness  acknowledgement.    Granting  NATO  access  does  not  require  changes  to  the Statement  of  Work  (SOW)  due  to  access  being  in  the  interest  of  the  US  Government.    DD Form 254 is completed to reflect access to NATO information. 4.5.  Security  Review  Process  (Pre-Publication  Review).  All military, civilian and contractor SCI-indoctrinated  personnel  submit  for  a  pre-publication.    (Note:    This  includes  any  material intended for disclosure that potentially contains SCI or SCI-derived information; proposed public statements on information derived from SCI or concerning SCI operations, sources, or methods; and;  resumes  or  applications  for  employment  which  detail  technical  expertise  gained  through government employment in classified or sensitive programs.)  Submit pre-publication requests to the  supporting  SSO  for  initial  review  and  disposition.    Additionally,  the  requirement  for  pre-publication review is part of an annual security education program.  If the MAJCOM SSO has a question  whether  SCI  material  is  included  or  not,  the  draft  is  forwarded,  by  secure  means,  to 25AF/SO  for  final  review  and  disposition.    25AF/SO  provides  a  classification  decision,  and returns the decision to the MAJCOM SSO within calendar 30 days.  If the material is proposed for  public  release,  formal  Public  Affairs  approval  is  required  IAW  AFI  35-102,  Security  and Policy Review Process.  The member initiates this process with the appropriate first-level Public Affairs office. 4.6.  Marking Classified Documents. 4.6.1.  All  intelligence  products,  classified  documents,  and  presentations  (hard  copy  and electronic)  is  properly  marked  IAW  Executive  Order  13526,  Classified  National  Security Information,  ICD 710,  Classification and Control Markings  System,  and as indicated in  the Intelligence  Community  Authorized  Classification  and  Control  Markings  Register  and Manual.  For additional information on marking requirements refer to the Security Markings Program (SMP) located on the ODNI Intelink resources page. 4.6.2.  Derivative classifiers receive training reinforcing the importance of accountability and accuracy  of  their  work  at  least  once  every  two  years.    The  MAJCOM  SIO  includes  this requirement in the command's training for intelligence personnel.  Derivative classifiers who do  not  receive  training  shall  have  their  derivative  classifier  authority  suspended  until  they receive training.  To assist, CAPCO has an IC marking system web-based training (WBT) at http://www.ncix.gov/training/wbt.php.  Go to Classification Management WBT. 4.6.3.  Derivative classifiers performing derivative classification include an IC element POC and  contact  instructions  at  the  end  of  all  intelligence  products  to  expedite  decisions  on information sharing. 32 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 4.7.  Classified  Coversheets.  Coversheets  prevent  unauthorized  viewing  of  classified documents and should be used whenever necessary. 4.7.1.  Coversheets for all security classifications and SCI compartments may be downloaded from the DIA SCI JWICS webpage at http://www.dia.ic.gov/homepage/security.html. 4.7.2.  To allow additional control markings/program identification, units may utilize locally reproduced/created classified coversheets provided they follow the format and color scheme of the DIA coversheets. 4.8.  DIA  CAB.  DoDM  5105.21,  V-1  requires  organizations  with  a  requirement  for  SCI intelligence  to  be  listed  in  the  DIA  CAB.    Each  SSO  with  a  CAB  account  validates  their information contained in the CAB annually, and locally maintain documentation of that review. AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 33 CHAPTER 5 SECURITY INCIDENTS 5.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  covers  the  reporting  procedures  for  SCI  Security  infractions, violations  or  inadvertent  disclosures.    Note:    Security  incidents  involving  NATO  classified information  is  handled  IAW  AFI  31-406  Chapter  8.    The  POC  for  NATO  related  security incidents is SAF/AAZI. 5.1.1.  Commanders,  suspend  access  to  SCI  when    information  exists  raising  a  serious question as to the individual's ability or intent to protect classified information, provided that the commander follows procedures in DoD 5200.2-R, paragraph C 8.1.3. 5.1.2.  Commanders consult with your servicing legal office for advice on disciplinary issues for  military  member,  labor  law  issues  for  civilian  employees,  and  contract  issues  for contractors. 5.2.  Initial Reporting. 5.2.1.  Persons  who  discover  an  SCI-related  security  incident  will  protect  any  SCI  present and notify an SCI security official immediately (T-0). the  next  duty  day. 5.2.1.1.  SCI  security  officials  report  all  SCI  security  incidents  via  secure  means  within 24  hours  or   The  standard  for  reporting  all  security violations/infractions and ensuring correspondence by email or message to their servicing SSO,  MAJCOM SSO,  and  AF  CSA  (A2ZS.workflow@actnet.ic.gov).    The  MAJCOM SSO will assign an incident number and forward the report to AF CSA via email (T-1).  For  security  incidents  occurring  within  the  HQ  MAJCOM  SSO,  the  MAJCOM  SSO reports the incident to the AF CSA who assigns an incident number.  Refer to Figure 5.1, Initial Report of Security Incidents. Figure 5.1.  Initial Report of Security Incidents. SAMPLE INITIAL REPORTING OF SECURITY INFRACTION/VIOLATION (CLASSIFICATION depends on content) FROM:   Reporting SSO TO:  MAJCOM SSO         SSO USAF//A2RS-CSA SUBJ:  Initial Notification of SCI Security Infraction/Violation and Request for Case Number 1.  Unit name and geographical location of infraction/violation. 2.  Date and time of infraction/violation. 3.  Summary of infraction/violation and initial compromise determination if there is one suspected.  Determination can be changed when final report is submitted. 4.  Inquiry or investigative official appointed? 5.  Point of contact, phone number and JWICS E-mail address. Note:  May be sent via message or JWICS E-mail. 5.2.1.2.  For all security incidents determined to be a security violation; SSOs provide a preliminary  assessment  of initial  report.  Compromise determinations are: the  compromise  determination in the 34 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 5.2.1.2.1.  Compromise  Certain.    SCI  has  irretrievably  left  SCI  control  channels; uncontrolled dissemination can be confirmed.  Examples include a violation in which SCI appears in a newspaper or other public media, or SCI is known to have been seen by a foreign national or non-SCI accessed US citizen, who there is reason to believe shall  not  protect  the  information.    When  a  SCI  eligible  non-indoctrinated  person views SCI, the security violation shall not be considered a certain compromise if there is reason to believe the information shall be protected. 5.2.1.2.2.  Compromise  Probable.    SCI  has  left  SCI  control  channels;  uncontrolled dissemination  may  reasonably  be  expected  to  occur,  but  a  specific  threat  cannot  be identified.   For example, an SCI document  found lying on a busy street  would be  a probable  compromise  because  there  is  no  way  of  knowing  if  anyone  saw  the document.    Cases  in  which  the  investigator  suspects  SCI  has  been  exposed  to unauthorized personnel, but believe that further inquiry draws undue attention to the information,  is  also  a  probable  compromise.    An  example  of  this  situation  is  the discussion  of  SCI  information  in  the  presence  of  non-SCI-indoctrinated  individuals.  In  this  instance,  the  administration  of  inadvertent  disclosure  agreement  would  be appropriate.    The  transmission  of  SCI  in  an  unclassified  Record  Massage  Traffic (RMT),  on  information  technology  (IT)  systems  or  other  electronic  media  devices given worldwide distribution could also fall into this category. 5.2.1.2.3.  Compromise  Possible.    The  possibility  of  uncontrolled  dissemination  of SCI cannot be ruled out, but with no specific indication to believe such dissemination takes place.  A lost document containing SCI or SCI materials found in a non-secure location  may  represent  a  possible  compromise.    Transmission  of  SCI  in  a  RMT message might also fall into this category if distribution was limited, if the message were  classified  either  SECRET  or  CONFIDENTIAL,  if  SCI  were  placed  on  an internal, non-Internet connected IT system, or if the SCI is unlikely to be recognized. 5.2.1.2.4.  Compromise  Improbable.    These  are  cases  in  which  uncontrolled  SCI dissemination is unlikely, but cannot be positively ruled out.  This category includes exposure of SCI to unauthorized persons where an inadvertent disclosure agreement has  been  executed,  or  where  the  personnel  exposed  are  SCI  eligible,  but  not indoctrinated for the material.  Compromise improbable also includes cases in which the investigator is satisfied that an unauthorized person is not aware of exposure or is unlikely  to  remember  the  SCI  material;  where  SCI  material  is  sent  through  the  US Postal  System  but  the  material  is  double  wrapped,  the  packaging  shows  no  sign  of tampering, and the material is delivered without undue delay.  Another example is a case  where  it  is  improbable,  but  not  certain,  that  the  material  ever  left  SCI  control channels. 5.2.1.2.5.  Compromise  None.    It  is  certain  that  SCI  did  not  leave  SCI  control channels and was not exposed to unauthorized personnel.  SCI found unsecured in a SCIF not authorized open storage may fall into this category.  Compromise none also applies to individuals who have a valid TOP SECRET clearance, are indoctrinated for a  category  of  SCI,  and  are  inadvertently  exposed  to  one  or  more  SCI  categories  for which they are not indoctrinated. AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 35 5.2.1.3.  AF CSA reports security violations and unauthorized disclosures determined to be compromises certain to DIA/SEC and SAF/AAZ respectively. 5.2.1.4.  The SSOs will notify the appropriate Facility Security Officer and/or CSSO and the COR of any incident which involves a contractor/consultant (T-1). 5.2.1.5.  Each  MAJCOM  will  develop  a  unique  numbering  system  identifying  the command, calendar year and case number for example, ACC-SV-2013-001 (T-1). the  procedures to 5.2.1.6.  Use initiate/conduct  preliminary inquiries/investigations.  Note:  For SCI incidents, the SIO, or designee, is the appointing official of the inquiry/investigating official and all reports are delivered to the SIO via the SSO. in  AFI  16-1404, 5.2.1.7.  SSOs  will  provide  inquiry/investigation  updates  at  least  every  30  days  to  the MAJCOM SSO and AF CSA via email (T-1). 5.2.2.  Reporting non-SCI incidents.  Collateral intelligence information infraction/violations, occurring within the SCIF, is reported to the SSO.  The MAJCOM SSO responds back to the notifying  SSO  assigning  a  case  number  to  the  security  infraction/violation.    Collateral violations that are determined not to contain intelligence data are turned over to the IP office. Figure 5.2.  Assignment of Security Incident Number.

The MAJCOM SSO adjudicates all security infraction/violations initiated within their command.  The AF CSA adjudicates security infractions/violations that directly involve the MAJCOM  SSO.    The  adjudication  is  based  on  the  information  in  the  final  report.    If  the report contains insufficient, unintelligible, or conflicting information, the MAJCOM SSO or AF CSA requests additional/clarifying information from the submitting agency. 36 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 5.3.2.  Following satisfactory adjudication of a case, the MAJCOM SSO will concur with or revise  the  incident  compromise  determination  and  close  the  case  (T-1).    The  AF  CSA reserves  the  right  to  make  a  final  ruling  on  case  closure  and  infraction/violation categorization or compromise determination. 5.3.3.  SCI incidents cannot be closed by the local commander.  All cases are to be reviewed and closed by the MAJCOM SSO and forwarded to the AF CSA for review. Figure 5.3.  Final Security Incident Report.

This chapter covers the physical security and protection of facilities for storing, processing, and discussing SCI. 6.2.  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facilities  (SCIFs).  Physical  security  standards for  the  construction  and  protection  of  SCIFs  are  prescribed  in  ICD  705  and  associated Intelligence Community Standards (ICS), from here forward referred to as ICD 705.  DoD SCIFs are established according to ICD 705 and this manual. 6.2.1.  SCIFs  are  designated  as  a  Restricted  Area  or  Controlled  Area  according  to  AFI  31-101.    The  SSO/CSSO  lists  the  SCIF  within  the  post  or  installation  directive  which  defines and  designates  all  local  controlled  areas  and  post  outside  the  SCIF  the  proper  English  and foreign (overseas areas only) language Restricted Area/Controlled Area signs as appropriate.  If a SCIF is physically located within a restricted area, it does not need to be designated as a controlled area. 6.2.2.  Restricted and Controlled Areas.  SCIFs designated as USAF Protection Level (PL) 1, 2 or 3 resources are located in restricted areas and SCIFS designated as PL 4 are located in controlled areas.  All SCIFs are protected and secured according to DoDM 5105.21, Volume 1-3 and AFI 31-101. 6.3.  Co-Utilization  of  SCIFs.  MAJCOM SSOs are the approving authorities for co-utilization of  subordinate  AF  SCIFs.    Use  the  format  in  DoDM  5105.21,  Volume  2,  to  request  SCIF  co-utilization approval.  Submit request through the local or supporting SSO to the MAJCOM SSO.  Include  the  proposed  Co-Utilization  Agreement  (CUA)  with  approval  request.    Request proposals and approval documentation will be maintained in the co-utilized SCIF for duration of the agreement (T-1). 6.4.  Special Access Programs (SAPs) Within DIA Accredited SCIFs. 6.4.1.  The  approval  authority  for  SAPs  in  SCIFs  is  the  MAJCOM  SIO.    This  authority cannot be delegated.  AF CSA approves CUAs that occupy multiple AF SCIFs.  MAJCOM SSO negotiate the CUA with their MAJCOM SAP security counterpart. AF CSA negotiates the  CUA,  as  needed,  with  the  appropriate  service  level  SAP  Controlling  Office.  Approvals for  SAPs  within  AF  SCIFs  are  secured  before  introduction  of  the  SAP  into  the  SCIF.    AF CSA  ensures  the  CUA  includes  language  that  allows  the  CUA  to  be  amended  by  the  local SSO and SAP security officer to local security conditions. 6.4.2.  Use the format below to request approval for introduction of SAP material within an AF SCIF.  Ensure subject and content of approval request is appropriately worded to specify it is a request for co-utilization of a SAP. Figure 6.1.  SAP CUA Request.

Specific location of a SCIF associated with accreditation level is classified as a minimum at “CONFIDENTIAL.” Note 3.  May be message or JWICS E-mail 6.5.  SCIF Entry and Exit Inspections. 6.5.1.  SCI  security  officials  for  AF  SCIFs  establish  procedures  for  random  inspections  of hand-carried items entering or exiting SCIFs during operational hours. These procedures are to  be  part  of  the  written  Standard  Operating  Procedure  (SOP)  or  Standard  Practices  and Procedures  (SPP)  for  contractors.    Note:    SSOs/SSRs  coordinate  random  inspection procedures with their local or MAJCOM legal office. 6.5.2.  Outgoing  Equipment  Inspections.    SSO/SSR/ISSO  assigned  to  a  SCIF  physically inspect  all  outgoing  equipment,  furniture,  and  related  items  to  prevent  the  unauthorized removal of classified information or accountable equipment.  Inspections shall be performed by  two  persons  and  documented  in  writing  (T-1).    Retain  documentation  for  one  year  after inspection.    AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 39 Figure 6.2.

Note:  In the following format sample “(*) is the prompt to add the appropriate classification within the text of the document. 6.6.5.  SCIF Inspections. 6.6.5.1.  MAJCOM  SSOs  nominate  to  AF  CSA  at  least  two  MAJCOM  personnel  for certification as SCIF inspectors.  Nominees possess the requisite knowledge to carry out SCIF  inspections,  gained  through  on-the-job  experience  and  formal  training  (i.e.  DIA’s SCI  Security  Official’s  Course,  or  equivalent,  and  Director  of  National  Intelligence [DNI] ICD 705 course, or equivalent).  In instances where an otherwise-qualified person has not  attended one of  the formal courses, MAJCOM SSOs may  coordinate a solution with  AF  CSA  to  obtain  training  and  enable  certification.    DIA/SEC  issue  individual certificates of completion and DIA/SEC and AF CSA maintains a master list of certified SCIF inspectors. 6.6.5.2.  When  an  inspection  result  in  recommendations  that  require  alteration  of  the physical  or  technical  configuration  of  the  SCIF,  then  prior  to  implementation,  such recommendations are up-channeled and approved through the MAJCOM SSO, AF CSA, and DIA/SEC (T-0). 6.6.5.3.

DIA/SEC  has  delegated  to  the  AF/A2  or  designees  the  authority  to  accredit  TSWAs and  T-SCIFs.    AF/A2  has  designated  MAJCOM  SSOs  as  the  accrediting  authority  for  T-SCIFs  and  TSWAs  in  their  areas  of  responsibility.    MAJCOM  SSO  personnel  are  granted this authority in writing by the MAJCOM SIO.  Additionally, those personnel appointed with this  authority  need  to  have  a  working  knowledge  of  ICD  705  and  the  policies  contained  in DoDM 5105.21 and this manual. 6.7.2.  A  TSWA  is  a  facility,  room,  or  area  used  on  a  temporary  or  intermittent  basis  for handling, discussing, or processing SCI, but where SCI is not stored.  The owning MAJCOM SSO  is  the  TSWA  approval  authority  (T-1).    The  AF  SCI  Authorizing  Official  and/or cognizant Delegated Authorizing Official is the approval authority for electronic processing of SCI within an approved TSWA. 6.7.2.1.  When  required  all  MAJCOM  SSOs  with  TSWA  designation  authority  will request  a  waiver  of  the  12  month  restriction  through  DIA  for  designated  Senior  Leader offices.  The waiver if granted is immediately terminated if the room no longer requires TSWA  designation.    TSWAs  with  waivers  will  be  provided  to  the  AF  CSA  within  30 days  of  approval,  a  complete  list  will  be  provided  on  a  yearly  basis  thereafter  when requested by the AF CSA (T-1).

TSWA Standalone Computer SOP. TEMPORARY SECURE WORKING AREA (TSWA) STANDALONE COMPUTER STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)  l.  This document outlines the security procedures employed for use of a standalone computer within a Temporary Secure Working Area ('ISWA).  It applies to all personnel using the SCI computer within the TSWA.  The computer is considered a Department of Defense (DoD) asset and national security interest computer system.  Use of a DoD computer system is restricted to authorized users only.  DoD computer systems will be monitored to ensure information security system integrity and the limitation of use to official purposes.  The use of DoD computer systems constitutes consent to monitoring as an integral part of systems management.  Information derived from system monitoring may be used as a basis for administrative, disciplinary or criminal proceedings.  Use of a computer within the TSWA constitutes the staff member's understanding of all rules and procedures for use of the equipment as outlined below:  2.  Any computer designated and approved use for within the TSWA (laptop or desktop) must be appropriately accredited and labeled (i.e., unclassified for NIPRNET, secret SIPRNET, and/or SCI for JWICS).  3.  The computer configuration shall be checked to determine if:      a.  All wireless capabilities has been disabled,      b.  Network ports have been disabled (e.g., connections that would enable NIPRNET or SIPRNET connectivity),      c.  The computer has had all current system updates/security patches/virus updates installed and completed,      d.  Only approved, licensed software is installed.  4.  The SCI computer shall receive system updates/security patches/virus updates via a JWICS connection only and within an accredited SCIF when not in use.  5.  The computer will be stored within an accredited SCIF when not in use.  6.  All media must be properly labeled and controlled by the media owner.  Removable information storage media will have external labels clearly indicating the classification of the information and applicable associated markings (e.g., digraphs, tri-graphs).  Examples include magnetic tape reels, cartridges, cassettes; removable media discs, disc cartridges, disc packs, diskettes, magnetic cards and electro-optical (e.g., CD) media.  Labels will be affixed to all media in a manner that does not adversely affect operation of the equipment in which the media is used.  Labels may be trimmed to fit the media.  Labels for compact disks (CD) must not be placed on the CD itself, but on the CD container or envelope.  Record the accounting number in the "control" block of the SF 71 1 and write the same number on the CD with a paint-pen, CD label maker or permanent marker.  The number should not interfere with the operation of the CD.  Note:  Do not use pens that contain toluene.  7.  The computer will be under constant escort/attendance by SCI indoctrinated individuals once taken from the host SCIF to the TSWA and returned.  The computer shall never be left 56 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 unattended by SCI indoctrinated personnel.  8.  A usage log for the SCI computer used within a TSWA shall be maintained.  The log must reflect the dates the computer was taken/returned between the host SCIF (include the SCIF ID number) and a TSWA, the TSWA location, names of staff members performing the escorting of the equipment, their telephone numbers, and the TSWA points of contact/telephone numbers.  9.  All classified media shall remain classified and controlled until explicitly declassified and/or destroyed I AW SCI destruction rules.  6.7.2.4.  One-time  use  TSWA  approval.    The  host  MAJCOM  SSO  is  the  approval authority  for  a  one-time  use  TSWA.    TSWA  approval  of  a  conference  room  of  similar location  for  one-time  use  does  not  require  secret  level  control  prior  to  the  TSWA approval or after the TSWA termination.  However, the facility is appropriately sanitized prior to and after the event.  One-time use is classified as eight hours or less. 6.7.3.  Temporary SCIFs (T-SCIFs).  MAJCOM SSOs are the accreditation authority for T-SCIFs.    When  a  T-SCIF  is  deployed  in  support  of  operations,  the  MAJCOM  SSO  may transfer the accreditation to the theater SSO and provide MAJCOM SSOs with information required by ICD 705 (T-1).  All computer and network systems that process SCI is assessed and authorized for operation by AO/DAO.  All T-SCIFs will be designated as controlled or restricted area (T-1). 6.7.4.  MAJCOM  SSOs  will  annually  submit  to  AF  CSA  via  email  the  following designations and delegations by 31 August (T-1).  AF CSA submits to DIA/SEC in writing by 30 September annually. 6.7.4.1.  Primary and Alternate MAJCOM SSO and MAJCOM SIO. 6.7.4.2.  Accrediting Authority for T-SCIFs. 6.7.4.3.  Accrediting Authority for TSWAs. 6.8.  Changes  to  Security  Posture.  Within  24  hours,  the  MAJCOM  SSO/CISO  will  report  to AF/A2ZS (AF CSA) all changes affecting the security posture of any SCIF (T-1). 6.9.  Transfer  of  Security  Cognizance.  When  transferring  the  SCIF  Physical  and  TEMPEST accreditations  from  one  agency  or  MAJCOM  to  another,  a  minimum  of  90  days  before  the transfer, all physical security standards will be maintained and accreditation records furnished to the gaining agency or MAJCOM for review (T-0).  Upon review; gaining agency/MAJCOM may request waivers/exceptions for existing facility as deemed appropriate when submitting required updated accreditation package to DIA. 6.10.  Alarm  System/Penetration/Security  Response  Testing.  SSOs  and/or  SSRs  conduct alarm system, security response tests, and exercises semiannually; penetration exercises annually and will provide copies of the results to the local security forces per AFI 31-101.  Note:  Ensure advance  coordination  with  a  trusted  agent  at  the  security  force  prior  to  a  scheduled  test. SSOs/SSRs maintain a copy of the alarm system/security response force test record as prescribed by ICD 705 (T-0). AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 57 Figure 6.11.

Unclassified  Speakerphones  in  a  DIA  Accredited  SCIF.  The  AF/A2  has  delegated  to MAJCOM SSOs the limited approval authority to activate unclassified speakerphones in SCIFs.  MAJCOM  SSOs  may  approve  this  activation  only  in  DIA/SEC  accredited  SCIFs  under  their cognizance.    MAJCOM  SSOs  are  not  authorized  to  delegate  this  approval  any  lower.    The following security requirements apply. 6.11.1.  Telephone  will  meet  the  technical  security  safeguards  outlined  in  ICD  705  and  be listed on the CNSSI 5006 (T-0). 6.11.2.  Speakerphone approval is in support of a government requirement rather than out of convenience. 6.11.3.  Telephone is located in a sole-use office or isolated area within a SCIF.  All walls of the sole-use office or isolated area should meet sound transmission class (STC-50) to prevent the transmission of classified discussions taking place outside the office or isolated area.  If the office or isolate area does not meet STC-50, procedures are implemented to ensure SCI discussions taking place in external areas adjacent to the sole-use office or isolated area are suspended  to  prevent  the  potential  compromise  of  classified  discussions  via  an  active speakerphone. 6.11.4.  If  the  approval  is  temporary  (less  than  24  hours)  the  related  documentation  is maintained as part of the permanent SCIF file. 6.11.5.  Long-term  or  permanent  approval  of  speakerphones  are  annotated  in  the  fixed facility  checklist  (FFC).    A  copy  of  the  FFC  is  forwarded  to  DIA/SEC  for  inclusion  in  the appropriate SCIF record and courtesy copied to AF CSA. 6.11.6.  Telephones connected to classified networks are not included in this authorization. 6.12.  Cellular Telephone Detectors. 6.12.1.  MAJCOM A2s are required to acquire cellular telephone detector devices for SCIFs that  house  more  than  7  people  and  receive  frequent  (more  than  twice  per  week)  visitors.  These devices are placed at the entrance of all existing SCIFs meeting the above criteria by the  end  of  FY  2017.    Organizations  will  factor  the  cost  of  this  device  into  all  new construction, renovation, maintenance and sustainment of their Command’s SCIFs (T-1). 6.12.2.  MAJCOM A2s through the organization with a requirement may acquire any system that  detects  the  most  common  cellular  telephone  signals  in  the  698  to  2690  MHz  UHF frequency  band.    Two  examples  of  such  products  are  Cellbusters’  Zone  Protector™  and Berkley  Varitronics  Systems’  Watchhound™  Cell  Phone  Security  Monitor.    These  are provided as examples only and do not constitute endorsement or direction to purchase these two products. 58 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 6.12.3.  SCI  security  officials  emphasize  the  cellular  phone  security  threat  during  regular security awareness, training, and education sessions and/or during recurring PED training (T-0). 6.12.4.  SSO/SSR personnel will ensure that prescribed prohibited electronic items signage is prominently displayed outside of each SCIF (T-1). 6.13.  VTC Systems. 6.13.1.  MAJCOM SSOs may approve the installation of VTC systems meeting the following configurations without seeking prior approval by DIA. 6.13.1.1.  System operating at a single level. 6.13.1.2.  Systems  operating  at  multiple  classifications  levels  that  employ  an  approved keyboard, video and monitor (KVM) switch. 6.13.2.  VTC systems with prior approval, while not requiring prior approval by DIA; will be identify on the fixed facility checklist for the affected SCIF (T-0). 6.13.3.  VTC system that operate  at  multiple classification levels  and does NOT employ an approved  KVM  switch  or  switching  devise,  i.e.,  audio–video  (AV)  mixers,  AV  system control  units  or  AV  extenders;  will  be  approved  by  DIA  certified  TEMPEST  technical authority (CTTA) prior to installation (T-0). 6.13.4.  Installation  of  any  VTC  is  IAW  the  TEMPEST  accreditation  for  the  SCIF  and Red/Black separation requirements. 6.13.5.  The  SSO,  in  collaboration  with  the  supporting  site  Information  Assurance  Security Manager,  develops  procedures  to  ensure  potential  vulnerabilities  inherent  with  operating  a VTC are  addressed.  Procedures  will be incorporated into existing SCIF  standard operating procedures (SOP) (T-0). 6.13.6.  VTC rooms are constructed to achieve sound transmission standard (STC) 50. 6.14.  Badging  Programs.  MAJCOM  SSOs  review  the  use  of  badging  system(s)  for  spaces owned exclusively under their authority.  AF CSA reviews all local badging system(s) that cross organizational  lines  of  authority.    AF  CSA  is  the  approval  authority  for  the  Intelligence Community Badge System (ICBS) whenever it is presented to the AF for use and access into AF owned SCIFs (T-1). 6.14.1.  Authorizations  for  Special  Access  badging  beyond  the  TS/SI/TK  level  needs  to  be validated  by  traditional  clearance  verification  procedures  in  advance  of  the  event  or  by validating clearances in JPAS or Scattered Castles, as defined by each IC element. 6.14.2.  IC and local access badges are US Government property and shall be returned to the security  office  or  issuing  badge  office  upon  transfer,  separation,  resignation,  firing, termination  of  contract,  and  affiliation  with  the  IC  or  no  longer  has  a  foreseeable  need  for access; the badge is retrieved and cancelled by the issuing IC element. 6.14.3.  ICS 704-01 establishes requirements, processes, procedures, and responsibilities for the  administration  of  the  ICBS  and  the  Intelligence  Community  Badge  Interoperability Program (ICBIP).  The ICBIP provides common badges that allow access to participating IC facilities and ensure positive identity verification with access audit capabilities. AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 59 6.14.3.1.  AF  communities  who  wish  to  participate  in  the  ICBP  submit  a  request  to  the AF  CSA.    The  submittal  includes  organizational  policies  and  procedures  to  implement the ICBS within their element.  The request includes as a minimum: 6.14.3.1.1.  Policies, SOP, EAP. 6.14.3.1.2.  Procedures reviewed and approved through the MAJCOM SSO. 6.14.3.1.3.  Availability  of  organization  funds,  to  include  equipment  cost  and installation. 6.14.3.1.4.  Local computer element approvals. 6.14.3.2.  IC  badges  do  not  display  or  include  any  insignia,  other  than  the  IC  seal,  to include a flag  behind or within the individual’s photo or any location on the front of the badge.  The badge cannot display any element identifiers or contain any security overlays (SCI caveats) or smart chips. 6.15.  Control  of  Compromising  Emanations  (TEMPEST).  The  TEMPEST  accreditation message  is  the  authoritative  document  identifying  the  requirements  to  contain  compromising emanations  within  the  inspectable  space  and  is  one  of  the  three  accreditations  required  for  a SCIF  to  become  operational  with  the  other  two  being  physical  and  information  system accreditations.    TEMPEST  standards  such  as  CNSSAM  TEMPEST/1-13  and  AFSSI  7702 reflects a risk management based approach to security.  TEMPEST requirements are assessed on the threat, amount of inspectable space, equipment type, physical control, etc. 6.15.1.  In  addition  to  TEMPEST  standards,  there  may  be  other  installation  standards  to consider such as the National Electrical Code, local construction standards, and in particular NSA at http://it.org.nsa.ic.gov/procmgmt/standards.    Failure  to  follow  these  standards  can  result in significant delays, additional costs, and possible denial of services. installation standards, which can be found 6.15.1.1.  TEMPEST  accreditation  documentation  is  processed  through  the  MAJCOM SSO to the respective accrediting authority with a copy sent to AF/A2-CSA (T-1). 6.15.1.2.  For  SCI  facilities,  the  accrediting  authority  (typically  DIA  or  NSA)  provides the organization a TEMPEST accreditation message or letter identifying their inspectable space  and  TEMPEST  countermeasure including  any  applicable RED/BLACK separation as described in CNSSAM TEMPEST/1-13.  Information on the SCIF accreditation process can be found in ICD 705, 705-1, ICS 705-2.  Information on the DIA accreditation process can be found in DoD Manual 5105.21, Volumes 1 through 3  or  by  calling  DIA/SEC-1B.    Information  on  the  NSA  process  is  available  through NSA/I3332. requirements 6.15.2.  Request  a  TEMPEST  reaccreditation  when  a  major  modification  of  the  facility occurs or the TEMPEST profile of the facility changes as described in DoD Manual 5105.21, Vol  2.    A  major  modification  is  anything  that  changes  or  negates  a  TEMPEST countermeasure.    A  change  in  the  TEMPEST  profile  is  anything  that  alters  the  inspectable space,  the  level  of  TEMPEST  threat,  or  the  technology  used  to  electronically  process  the SCI.  Requests are documented on the TEMPEST Checklist (ICD/ICS 705) and submitted to the accrediting authority through SSO channels. 60 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 6.15.3.  The  RED/BLACK  facility  design  philosophy  is  to  provide  sufficient  attenuation  or isolation  between  RED  equipment/lines  and  BLACK  equipment/lines  that  leave  the inspectable  space.    The  level  of  attenuation  or  isolation  is  dependent  on  the  size  of  the inspectable space.  The CNSSAM TEMPEST/1-13 RED/BLACK requirement levels (e.g., I, II,  III)  correspond  to  the  level  of  protection  needed  to  contain  compromising  emanations within the inspectable space.  The levels are based upon the installation of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment within a standard commercially built office building.  As a part of risk management, the requirement level is less stringent for lower classification levels of information processed within the US and is more stringent for higher classification levels of information processed outside the US. 6.15.4.  Facility  Shielding  and  Shielded  Enclosures.    The  use  of  shielded  enclosures  and alternative shielding materials is based on the results of an evaluation performed according to CNSSI 7000.  The evaluation is conducted or validated by the cognizant CTTA. 6.15.5.  Windows  are  one  of  the  most  vulnerable  aspects  of  a  facility.    Numerous  window treatment products have been developed to provide differing degrees of attenuation to various forms  of  wireless  transmissions  such  as  radio  frequency  and  infrared.    The  TEMPEST accreditation provided by the cognizant CTTA identities if window treatments are required.  The  installation  of  window  blast  protection  measures  provides  an  excellent  opportunity  to also add wireless attenuation measures with minimal additional cost. 6.15.6.  Wireless, especially Radio Frequency (RF), devices and systems pose a particularly significant TEMPEST hazard if not installed using good engineering practices.  Devices that fall  under  this  category  are  radio  transmitters,  receivers,  land  mobile  radios,  receive  and transmit pagers, cellular telephones, wireless microphones, cordless telephones, portable data assistants,  wireless  local  area  networks,  etc.    These  devices  are  generally  prohibited  in  a SCIF. 6.15.6.1.  IC Tech Spec for ICD and ICS 705 places wireless devices into high, medium, and low vulnerability categories and provides initial guidance for their use. Receive-only pagers and infrared devices that convey no intelligence data (text, audio, video, etc.) such as  mice,  remote  controls  and  pointing  devices  pose  no  TEMPEST  risk  and  require  no TEMPEST mitigation to be introduced into SCIFs. 6.15.6.2.  The installation of wireless devices and RF transmitters in spaces that process NSI  presents  other  information  assurance  vulnerabilities  and  will  require  additional approval from the AF CSA (T-1).  Coordination with local security officials and approval through the MAJCOM SSO is required prior to introducing wireless devices into a SCIF. 6.15.7.  TEMPEST  in  the  Airborne  Environment  (Tactical  Equipment).    See  CNSSAM TEMPEST/1-13 and IC Tech Spec for ICD and ICS 705, for unique aircraft operations and installation.    Based  on  AFSSI  7702,  all  aircraft  carrying  classified  processing  systems  are tested  according  to  CNSSAM  TEMPEST/01-02  during  airborne  system  procurements  and modifications unless otherwise specified by a CTTA.  This includes remotely piloted aircraft. AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 61 CHAPTER 7 VISITOR CONTROL 7.1.  Overview.  The  SSO  and  the  CSSO  are  the  official  channels  and  points  of  contact  for verification of SCI accesses through JPAS and Scattered Castle.  The AF clearance verification is a “pulled” not “pushed” process using the information in JPAS or Scattered Castles. 7.1.1.  JPAS is the primary DoD clearance verification system. 7.1.2.  Scattered Castle is the secondary system through the IC Security Clearance Repository for verification of clearances and accesses. 7.1.3.  Local listing(s) though highly discouraged can be used for access control by the SSO or  CSSO  and  will  be  approved  by  the  local  SIO  (T-1).    Procedures  will  include  100% verification by the SSO or designated authorities using the DoD primary source JPAS. 7.2.  JPAS  or  Scattered  Control.  JPAS  and  Scattered  Castles  when  used  to  verify  personnel security  clearances  does  eliminate  the  need  for  visit  and  permanent  certification  (Perm-Cert) except for special circumstances, i.e. large scale exercises.  However, special circumstances will require the approval of the AF CSA (T-1). (Note:  If the local procedures of the visited agency require a visitor or permanent certification prior to access, send the requested information.  Accomplishing the mission is the number one priority.) 7.2.1.  SSOs accept, from other AF units and IC agencies, all “in-scope”, security clearance, or access determinations unless there are waivers, conditions, or deviations.  Individuals with records where there are waivers, conditions, or deviations; SSOs contact the owning SSO and request additional information before allowing access (T-0). 7.2.2.  The  organization  disclosing  the  classified  information  has  the  responsibility  to establish the positive identification of all individuals before determining the need-to-know or need-for-access;  prior  to  disclosing  any  classified  information  or  granting  access.    The government sponsor (military or civilian) within the visited organization coordinates with the security  office  prior  to  the  visit  to  ensure  the  visitor  has  the  appropriate  clearance  prior  to access (T-2). 7.2.3.  In  the  case  of  contractors,  the  COR  for  the  specific  contract  provides  a  list  of contractor personnel, copies of the DD Form 254 with attachments, and the exercised period of performance dates of the contract being worked within the visited SCIF to the unit sponsor and/or SSO per local procedures (T-2). 7.2.4.  Visitors  are  still  required  to  coordinate  with  the  sponsoring  organization  to  ensure access and badging requirements are completed. 7.2.4.1.  For visits longer than 15 calendar days, the SSO with security cognizance over the visited unit will in-processes the visitor and claim “servicing” responsibility in JPAS (T-1).  This  ensures notifications regarding the visitor’s security  clearance are  received.  Visits less than 15 calendar days, the SSO with security cognizance over the visited unit may  claim  “servicing”  responsibility  in  JPAS  after  prior  coordination  with  the  visitor's SSO. 62 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 7.2.4.2.  When  reviewing  JPAS  for  SCI  access  for  visiting  personnel,  the  lack  of  a government  SCI  Security  Management  Office  (SMO)  code,  or  “US”  access  could  be considered  errors  in  the  currency  of  JPAS  data.    When  encountering  these  situations, security officials notifies the sponsor and inform the visitors to have their SSO update the relationship status and/or US accesses in JPAS (T-2). 7.2.5.  SSO access certification via JPAS, message or facsimile is still authorized if: 7.2.5.1.  JPAS  and/or  Scattered  Castles  record  does  not  validate  the  level  of  access required. 7.2.5.2.

Name and Telephone number of FSO/CSSO. 12.  Visits.  The contractor will submit the written request for SCI visit certifications through the COR for approval of the visit.  The certification must arrive at their servicing (SSO name) at least three working days prior to the visit. 13.  Information assurance and electronic processing; information security (computer) and network connectivity require accreditation of the equipment connectivity. 14.  Reference Block 15.  This contract requires access to SCI.  If the contractor has established a SCIF, DIA and its designees are responsible for all inspections of the contractor SCIF and SCI security management program for ensuring compliance with all SCI security regulations and policies.  If a new SCIF must be established in accordance with this contracting effort, permission to build/accredit a SCIF must be requested through the COR and forwarded to the SSO.  Special Security Officers reserve the right to conduct program reviews of AF SCI materials and SCI program management to ensure the protection of AF equities.  15.  Contract estimated completion date:  (DATE) (Note:  Section “F” of the contract usually provides the Period of Performance.  Option years are not to be included as an option is not valid until exercised by the government.  Minor modification are authorized.) 8.3.3.  The local unit is listed as a performance location on the DD Form 254 (Block 8). 8.3.4.  The  local  COR  endorses  the  requirement.    If  the  COR  is  not  located  on  the  base  a local government representative is appointed (Names are annotated in block 13).  The COR must be indoctrinated for SCI access in  order to  verify the SCI contract  deliverables  (T-1).  The  COR  is  also  read  into  any  program  material  to  hold  accountability  of  released intelligence.  CORs not verifying SCI deliverables are not to be granted SCI access. 8.3.5.  The individual’s ICD 704 eligibility is favorably adjudicated.  If not adjudicated, the SSO  annotates  SCI  SMO  ownership  of  the  individual  in  JPAS,  requests  an  upgrade  of eligibility through the DoD CAF and waits for the case to be adjudicated. 8.3.6.  The individual has signed a NdS. 8.3.7.  A SCI security indoctrination has been completed. 8.4.  DD  Form  254  Preparation.  MAJCOM  SSOs  are  responsible  for  SCI  security  on  any contract requiring access to SCI in a facility under their cognizance.  MAJCOM SSO, may give approval  (in  writing)  for  specific  instances  where  the  Supporting/Servicing  SSO/SSR  signs  the DD Form 254.  When the Supporting/Servicing SSO/SSR has cognizance over a contract a copy of the final DD Form 254 is sent to the MAJCOM SSO (T-1). AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 65 8.4.1.  MAJCOM  SSOs  identify  supporting  security  officials  who  shall  provide  minimum SCI requirements to the COR as a DD Form 254 addendum when a contract or solicitation is being  prepared.    Refer  to  Figure  8.1  for  minimum  requirements.    MAJCOMs  may supplement as needed (T-2). 8.4.2.  Access to SCI will be fully justified in the SOW or PWS to include the specific types of information needed, whether access to JWICS is needed, why sanitized intelligence cannot be  utilized,  and  the  impact  if  access  is  not  approved  (T-1).    Granting  SCI  access  for  the purpose  of  allowing  a  contractor  to  transit  an  SCI  area  in  route  to  a  work  site  or  for convenience of assigned personnel is not sufficient justification for approving access. 8.4.3.  Local SSO/SSR forward the DD form 254 and associated SCI Addendum to the SIO or  designated  representative  for  the  final  review  for  contractor  access  before  MAJCOM approval (T-1). 8.5.  Subcontractors. 8.5.1.  The  prime  contractor  is  responsible  for  preparing  DD  Form  254s  for  SCI  access  of their subcontractors.  Completed subcontractor DD 254’s are provided to the supporting SSO for  their  review  and  validation.    Supporting  SSO  submit  the  reviewed  and  validated  DD Form 254 to the MAJCOM SSO (listed on the Prime Contract) for approval (T-1). 8.5.2.  Subcontractor employees will meet all security requirements prior to access (T-1). 8.6.  Contracts Affecting other MAJCOMs/Bases. 8.6.1.  When a contract  requires work  at  a base,  for more than 30 days, other than where it was let, the SSO responsible for the work location receive a copy of the DD Form 254 and associated  addendums prepared by the COR responsible for the contract.   A DD Form 254 which  affects  other  MAJCOMs/bases  should  include  a  requirement  stating  the  contractor complies with all local security requirements at the work location (T-1). 8.6.2.  The  SSO  with  security  cognizance  at  the  work  location  is  authorized  to  issue  a supplemental SCI addendum covering local situations/requirements. 8.7.  Contractor Visit Authorizations. 8.7.1.  A  contractor  is  not  authorized  access  to  classified  information  at  any  level  unless authorized by a DD Form 254 for their contract. 8.7.2.  If a contractor needs to visit an AF installation or activity, the visit is coordinated in advance with  the host installation and host agency.  The installation commander is  the sole authority  responsible  for  granting  contractors  access  to  the  installation,  regardless  of  which DOD agency, military service component, or activity awarded the contract.  The installation commander designates contractors who require access to the installation in the performance of  a  government  contract  as  intermittent  visitors,  integrated  visitor  groups,  or  cleared facilities (T-1). 8.7.3.  If a contractor’s visit requires access to SCI, the visited location verifies the visitor’s security  clearance  and  SCI  access  levels.    Verification  of  a  visitor’s  clearance  may  be accomplished by a review of JPAS or Scattered Castles databases.  Verification that the visit is  in  support  of  performance  under  a  valid  classified  contract  is  also  required  and  may  be accomplished  by  a  review  of  the  relevant  DD  Form  254  or  certification  from  the  COR 66 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 responsible for the contract.  The COR provides certification, contractor's name, address, and telephone number, assigned Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, if applicable, and certification of the level of the facility security clearance is required (T-1). 8.8.  SSO  Record  Keeping  Requirements  for  Contractors.  SSOs maintain current DD Form 254s,  COR  appointment  letters  from  the  contracting  office,  COR  duties  letter,  and  a  list  of contractors working the specific contract (validated by COR on an annual basis or when changes are made).   Records are  maintained for two  years after the contract  is  terminated, performance has ended or the contract is closed out (T-2). 8.9.  Release of Intelligence to US Contractors. 8.9.1.  AF/A2  implements  and  carries  out  the  DNI’s  policies  and  procedures  for  using, protecting  and  disseminating  intelligence.    AF/A2  is  the  AF’s  final  authority  for  approving the release of intelligence to contractors.  Only AF/A2 can release information to contractors from  the  National  Intelligence  Analytical  Memoranda  without  identifying  it  as  national intelligence. 8.9.2.  The  MAJCOM  SIO  and  their  field  command  designees  can  release  intelligence  to their  command  contractors  without  specific  approval  from  the  AF/A2  if  the  intelligence meets the criteria listed in, ICD 703,Protection of Classified National Intelligence, Including Sensitive  Compartmented  Information,  intelligence  is  not  marked  with  restricted  control markings,  and  the  intelligence  is  not  restricted  to  the  executive  branch  of  the  US Government.  For access the SIO or designee will perform the following functions: 8.9.2.1.  Evaluate the sponsor’s request for intelligence by examining the DD Form 254, and SOW or PWS to determine if the specific intelligence is appropriate for the contract.  Ensure network access provided to contractor(s) (e.g. access to Secure Internet Protocol Network  [SIPRNET],  JWICS,  and/or  any  other  classified  network)  for  the  purpose  of contract  execution is  documented on the DD  Form 254 in  Block 11.  The finalized DD Form  254  is  used  by  the  SIO  or  designee  appointee  to  document  the  release  of intelligence information to the contractor (T-1). 8.9.2.2.  Ensure  the  COR  accounts  for  all  intelligence  information  released  to  the contractor (T-1). 8.9.2.3.  Ensure  electronic  access  to  classified  information  is  documented  via  the  DD Form 254 and is accounted for by using government oversight (T-1). 8.9.2.4.  Ensure Air Staff activities, MAJCOMs, and FOAs without an SIO refer requests to the AF CSA for release approval. 8.9.3.  Intelligence  that  carries  the  PROPIN  markings  requires  written  permission  of  the originating  agency  before  release  to  contractors  within  or  outside  of  government  owned  or controlled facilities. 8.9.4.  Intelligence  that  carries  the  ORCON  marking  requires  written  permission  of  the originating agency before release to a contractor outside of government owned or controlled facilities.  Sponsoring agencies delete any reference to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) phrase “Directorate of Operations” and any of its components, place acquired, field number, source  description,  and  field  dissemination  from  all  CIA  Directorate  of  Operations  reports passed to contractors, unless prior approval to do otherwise is obtained from CIA.  (T-0) AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 67 8.9.5.  If you cannot sanitize the documents, you can request release for intelligence bearing these  markings  through  the  originator.    Provide  a  courtesy  copy  of  the  request  to  your MAJCOM SSO (T-1). 8.9.6.  All  inquiries  concerning  source,  acquisition,  use,  control  or  restrictions  pertaining  to Intelligence Information are directed to the releasing agency (T-1). 8.9.7.  Classified  foreign  intelligence  materials  must  not  be  released  to  foreign  nationals  or immigrant  aliens  whether or not  they  are also  consultants, US  contractors, or  employees of the  contractor,  regardless  of  the  level  of  their  security  clearance,  except  with  advanced written permission from the originator (T-1). 8.9.8.  The  contractor  will  be  trained  and  authorized  by  the  SIO/SSO  to  courier  SCI documents, material, or equipment if required by the DD Form 254 (T-1). 8.10.  Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI).  A US company is considered to be under  FOCI  whenever  a  foreign  interest  has  the  power,  direct  or  indirect  (whether  or  not exercised and whether or not exercisable through the ownership of the US company’s securities, by  contractual  arrangements  or  other  means),  to  direct  or  decide  matters  affecting  the management or operations of the company in a manner that may result in unauthorized access to classified information or may adversely affect the performance of classified contracts. 8.10.1.  If  a  government  contracting  activity  (GCA)  requires  a  company  cleared  under  a Special Security Agreement (SSA) to have access to SCI, the GCA is required to complete a National Interest Determination (NID) to confirm that disclosure of such information will not harm the national security interests of the US (T-0). 8.10.2.  All  NIDs  for  SCI  access  is  processed  by  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National Intelligence (ODNI) or the Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive (ONCIX), Special  Security  Directorate  (SSD).    ONCIX/SSD  should  complete  the  SCI  NID  process within five to thirty calendar days (T-1). 8.10.3.  The requirement for NIDs applies equally to new contracts to be issued to companies already cleared under SSAs or proxy agreements as well as existing contracts when cleared companies are acquired by foreign interests and an SSA or proxy agreement is the proposed mitigation.  NIDs may be program, project or contract-specific. 8.10.4.  If  foreign  interests  can  or  may  be  able  to  control  or  influence  the  operations  or management  of  a  contractor  organization,  that  contractor  organization  is  under  FOCI.  Contractor  organizations  under  FOCI  are  generally  ineligible  for  access  to  SCI  and  SCI activities. 8.10.5.  Waivers to Ineligibility.  The ODNI may support a NID to waive the ineligibility for access  of  a  contractor  organization  if  a  review  of  the  circumstances  shows  a  need  to  grant access, and it can be determined that: 8.10.5.1.  The FOCI does not involve communist countries or countries overtly hostile to the US. 8.10.5.2.  Indebtedness  to  foreign  interests  does  not  exceed  five  percent  of  the organization’s current assets. 68 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 8.10.5.3.  Information  disclosed  regarding  securities  held  in  “nominee  shares”  or  “street names” reveals no indication of adverse FOCI. 8.10.5.4.  Foreign  interest  does  not  have  the  right  to  control  or  influence  the  election, appointment, or tenure of an organization’s managing officials. 8.10.6.  The  ODNI  approves  waivers  based  on  an  approved  SSA  or  proxy  agreement.    The waiver  is  contingent  on  an  annual  review  of  the  company’s  eligibility  for  continued  SCI access  to  ensure the organization continues to  have measures in  place that  preclude foreign interests from gaining access to SCI. 8.10.6.1.  The  annual  facility  program  review,  including  a  review  of  the  SSA  or  proxy agreement, performed by the Defense Security Service (DSS) can fulfill this requirement.  DSS certifies a favorable review to the appropriate COR and servicing SSO. 8.10.6.2.  More frequent reviews of an organization’s eligibility for continued SCI access may  be  required  if  changes  occur  that  could  enable  foreign  interests  to  control  or influence  the  management  of  operations  of  the  organization  to  the  extent  that  it  would endanger the security of SCI or SCI activities. 8.10.6.3.  When  there  is  doubt  about  an  organization’s  eligibility  and  willingness  to safeguard  SCI  against  foreign  access;  in  the  interest  of  national  security,  access authorization will be revoked. 8.10.7.  Email  correspondence  is  the  only  accepted  means  of  submitting  a  National  Interest Determination  (NID)  request  to  the  ODNI.    The  request  will  not  be  processed  unless  it includes the following information: (T-0). Figure 8.2.  National Interest Determination Request. NID REQUEST 1.  A copy of the SSA or reasons why SSA cannot be released. 2.  Proposed contractor and/or subcontractor to include:      Contractor’s Name and Address      Cage Code      Description of its Foreign Ownership      Prime Contract Number, Subcontract Number and Solicitation Number      Whether the proposed contract is part of an existing program or project 3.  General description of the procurement and performance requirements that include the following:      Why the foreign company needs access to SCI      Who will have access to the material 4.  List the national security interests involved and the ways in which the release of information is consistent with those national interests 5.  Existing internal agency threat assessments regarding the contractor or subcontractor.  If threat assessment does not exist, DSS completes the requirement during the DSS review process within their organization. 6.  A copy of the last DSS annual Facility Program Review (conducted within the last year). AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 69 8.10.8.  If  the  MAJCOM  SSO  receives  the  NID,  the  MAJCOM  SSO  forwards  the  SCI portion  of  the  NID  request  to  the  AF  CSA  electronically  to  usaf.pentagon.af.a2.mbx.af-A2ZS-workflow@mail.mil. 8.10.9.  Organization Eligibility and Changes.  Notify AF CSA immediately of any changes to  the  organization’s  security  posture  that  could  affect  the  organization’s  eligibility  and willingness to safeguard SCI against foreign access, or if DSS revokes the FCL (T-1). 70 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 CHAPTER 9 SECURITY EDUCATION TRAINING AND AWARENESS PROGRAM (SETA) 9.1.  Overview.  How  well  an  employee  understands  their  responsibilities  should  be  the  focal point  of  any  security  program  when  it  comes  to  protecting  our  nation’s  secrets.    Employees  at every level, are educated in and frequently reminded of sound security practices and procedures.  SETA  is  the  process  through  which  employees  are  made  aware  of  the  threats  to,  and  critical safeguarding  procedures  of  National  Security  Information,  including  SCI.    Upon  appointment, designated  SCI  Security  Officials,  SSO,  SSRs,  CSSOs  and  specified  support  personnel  should attend  a  SCI  Security  Officials  Course  provided  by  ODNI  or  DoD,  (a  similar  course  may  be substituted)  within  6  months  upon  assumption  of  these  duties.    If  the  appointees  cannot  attend training  within 6 months SSO, SSR or SIO conducts  training locally designed to/for the duties assigned (T-2). 9.2.  SCI  Security  Education  Program.  Each  SSO/CSSO  ensures  all  SCI  indoctrinated personnel  under his  or her security  cognizance receives security  awareness information  at  least annually (T-2).  Security training must be of sufficient frequency and visibility to identify SCI as requiring special and unique protection. It is highly suggested to develop quarterly training with in person classes. 9.2.1.  Identify the roles and responsibilities of the SIO, SSO, and other appropriate officials, emphasizing  individual  responsibilities  regarding  the  protection,  use,  and  dissemination  of SCI and need to adhere to SCI eligibility standards. 9.2.2.  Place  special  emphasis  on  recent  or  recurring  SCI  security  incidents  or  problems  as well  as  local  SCI  security  policies  and  procedures.    The  SSO  may  use  a  variety  of transmission  means  (newsletters,  security  bulletins,  pamphlets,  seminars,  and  posters),  at appropriate classification levels (T-2). 9.2.3.  The Security Education Program follows training outlined in DoDM 5105.21-V3, and DNI required training on Unauthorized Disclosures and ORCON. 9.2.4.  Specialized  Education  and  Training.    SIO/SSOs  ensure  SCI  courier  policies, procedures, and responsibilities are given to individuals designated by the SIO/SSO to act as an SCI courier (T-1). 9.2.5.  In  developing  local  SCI  security  educational  and  training  programs,  use  any applicable  regulation,  current  security  trends  and  lessons  learned  from  security  incidents investigations. 9.2.5.1.  Maintain SETA records of SCI education and training for 2 years (T-1). 9.2.5.2.  Derivative  security  classification  training  must  be  completed  within  30  days  of arrival at a new duty station/assignment and once every two years thereafter.  Individuals that  fail  to  complete  either  the  initial  training  within  30  days  or  fail  to  complete  the biennial training at least once every two years are considered “non-current” and no longer have authority to prepare classified documents to include classified emails regardless of system.

Compelling Need—Requirement to grant a particular individual access to SCI when that person does  not  possess  the  required  security  clearance  or  meet  personnel  security  standards.    The justification for access shows that the benefits to be gained clearly and substantially outweigh the risks involved, explain why another cleared person cannot perform the task, and explain why the individual  cannot  be  processed  normally  for  SCI  access.    A  compelling  need  exists  when denying access would result in mission failure or serious mission degradation. Compromise of SCI—Loss of control over any SCI resulting in a reasonable assumption that it could have, or confirmation of the fact that it has, become known to unauthorized persons.

CUA  clearly  specify  SCIF  security  requirements  and  the  operational responsibilities to be fulfilled by the parties to the agreement.  Organizations that petition to co-utilize  a  SCIF  need  to  have  a  clearly  defined  intelligence  mission  requiring  ongoing  handling, review,  and  dissemination  of  SCI  or  similar  highly  sensitive  material  for  which  the  protective environment of a SCIF is essential. Covered  Employment—Direct  employment  by,  representation  of,  or  the  provision  of  advice relating  to  national  security  to  the  government  of  a  foreign  country  or  any  person  whose AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 81 activities  are  directly  or  indirectly  supervised,  directed,  controlled,  financed,  or  subsidized,  in whole or in major part, by any government of a foreign country.

It  is  the  primary  means  of  transferring  bulky  or  large  SCI  documents/material (Formerly Defense Courier Service). Disclosure—Showing or revealing classified intelligence, whether orally, in writing or any other medium, without providing the recipient with a copy of such information for retention. DoDIIS  Site—The  DoDIIS  Site-Based  Authorization  Process  uses  management  techniques  to assess risk by establishing a security domain called a “DoDIIS Site”.  This concept incorporates Site  Security  Management  as  a  function  of  the  DoDIIS  Site’s  CM  process.    A  DoDIIS  Site Security Baseline defining the systems infrastructure is required and any changes to the baseline is documented in a timely manner.  Before a DoDIIS site can establish a Site Security Baseline and  be  accredited,  all  system(s)  go  through  the  security  A&A  process.    The  Site  Security Baseline begins with the evaluation and authorization of all individual ISs at the site.  All ISs are then  consolidated  into  this  single  management  entity  and  evaluated  as  part  of  the  security environment  in  which  they  operate.    Site-Based  Authorization  ex  The  maturity  of  site  security policies,  procedures,  configuration  management,  system  integration  management,  and  risk management determines the site’s ability to successfully establish and control a secure baseline." Due  Process—Due  process  has  three  elements,  all  of  which  apply  when  adverse  actions  with respect to SCI access determination are proposed.

Technical  Surveillance  Countermeasures  (TSCM)  Survey—Thorough  physical,  electronic, and visual examination by special agents from AFOSI or similar DoD agencies in and about an area  to  detect  technical  surveillance  devices,  technical  security  hazards,  and  attempts  at clandestine  penetration  of  the  facility  for  hostile  technical  collection  of  classified  and  sensitive  information.    TSCM  surveys  differ  from  TEMPEST  surveys  in  that  the  latter  are  limited  to investigation and studies of compromising emanations whereas the TSCM surveys are basically designated to prevent the technical penetration efforts of a hostile intelligence service. Telecommunications—For  the  purpose  of  this  manual,  a  general  term  expressing  data transmission between computing systems and remotely located devices via a unit that performs the necessary format conversion and controls the rate of transmission. Telecommunications  Center  (TCC)—Communications  center  may  be  a  dedicated  DSSCS, DSSCS/GENSER, or GENSER only communications center. Temporary  Eligibility—When  access  to  SCI  is  justified  by  the  Commander/Director  prior  to completion of requisite investigation.  Eligibility is based on favorable screening interview and 86 AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 AF CAF approval.    Continuing access  is  contingent  upon favorable adjudication of completed background investigation. Temporary  Secure  Working  Area  (TSWA)—Area,  room,  or  group  of  rooms  (for  example, briefing  rooms,  conference  rooms,  ADP  areas)  which  have  been  properly  secured  against physical and audio  penetration for the temporary  (not to  exceed an average total  of 40 hours a month within a 12-month period) use of SCI.  No storage of SCI is permitted in a TSWA. TK Control Officer (TCO)—On behalf of the commander, the TCO inspects local TK facilities and for the security control, use and dissemination of TK material and related security education programs.  Tenant units will also be inspected when requested by those commanders. Transfer-in-Status  (TIS)—TIS  allows  an  SCI-indoctrinated  person  to  transfer  from  one assignment to another with no interruption in their SCI-indoctrination.  It is the responsibility of the gaining SSO to request a TIS from the losing SSO.  AFMAN14-304  23 DECEMBER 2016 87 Attachment 2 SCI SCREENING INTERVIEW (FOUO when filled-in) ___________________________________________________ (Name, Grade and SSN of Interviewee) 1.
