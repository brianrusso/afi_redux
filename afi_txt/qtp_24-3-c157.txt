Training objectives:    5.1.1.1.  Given lectures, demonstrations, hands-on driving session, and a performance test, trainees will be able to perform operator’s inspection and complete the performance test with zero instructor assists.  5.1.1.2.  Train and qualify each trainee in safe operation and preventive maintenance of the various telephone maintenance hydraulic derrick trucks.  5.1.1.3.  This training will ensure the trainee becomes a qualified digger derrick operator—an operator who has the knowledge and skills to operate a telephone maintenance hydraulic digger derrick truck in a safe and professional manner. 5.1.2.  Desired learning outcomes:  5.1.2.1.  Understand  the  safety  precautions  to  be  followed  before,  during,  and  after operation of the telephone maintenance hydraulic derrick trucks.  5.1.2.2.  Be completely familiar with the safety features of the derrick truck.  5.1.2.3.  Safely and proficiently operate the telephone maintenance hydraulic derrick truck.  5.1.2.4.  Understand the purpose of the telephone maintenance hydraulic derrick truck and its role in the mission.  5.1.2.4.1.   The  purpose  of  the  telephone  maintenance  hydraulic  derrick  truck  is  to accomplish lifting and digging jobs through the use of hydraulic power.  5.1.2.4.2.   Role in the mission (Unit/Base/Community (during natural disasters)/Air Force). 5.1.3.  Telephone  maintenance  hydraulic  derrick  truck  design.    The  design  of  a  telephone maintenance hydraulic derrick truck varies depending on the vehicle manufacturer.  Refer to the  manufacturer’s  operator’s  manual  for  additional  information  on  the  specific  telephone maintenance hydraulic derrick truck being operated.  5.1.4.  The  digger  derrick  is  a  truck-mounted,  hydraulically  operated  piece  of  equipment designed to do two jobs:  lifts heavy loads and digs with an auger.  The trainee should be able to identify the following components of the telephone maintenance hydraulic derrick truck:  5.1.4.1.  Air brakes.  5.1.5.  The Derrick.  The derrick is the part of a digger derrick that is used to accomplish the lifting function.  The derrick consists of a pedestal/turntable assembly (the pedestal) and an extendable boom.  5.1.5.1.  Pedestal.  The pedestal is mounted on the truck body.  The pedestal supports the boom and houses the motor that rotates the boom.  Digger derricks are often classified according to where on the truck body the pedestal is mounted.  5.1.5.1.1.   Rearmount.  A digger derrick with the pedestal mounted at the back of the truck and the boom stored over the truck cab.  5.1.5.1.2.   Centermount.  A digger derrick with the pedestal mounted directly behind the truck cab and the boom stored over the back of the truck. 5.1.4.2.  Front wench control lever.  5.1.4.3.  Boom control lever.  5.1.4.4.  Control lever for rotation, lowering, raising the boom.  5.1.4.5.  Auger release switch.  5.1.4.6.  Hydraulic tamper lever.  5.1.4.7.  Tamper.  5.1.4.8.  Pole puller and hoses.   5.1.5.1.3.   Cornermount.  A digger derrick with the pedestal mounted at the rear of the truck, similar to a rearmount but off-center over one corner of the truck.  5.1.5.2.  Extendable Boom.  The extendable boom is attached to the pedestal.  The boom is typically made in several sections, which allow it to be extended or retracted.  It can be raised,  lowered  and  swung  around  in  a  circle.    This  allows  the  tip  of  the  boom  to  be positioned anywhere within a wide area around the truck.  5.1.5.3.  Pole grabbers.  Mounted at the tip of the boom.  Pole grabbers are hydraulically operated jaws, which can be used to guide a pole and stabilize it in position as it is being set.  They can be opened and closed and, on some vehicles, tilted up and down.  5.1.5.4.  Winch.  A powered reel device used with a winch line for lifting.  The winch can be mounted on the pedestal, or it can be mounted at the tip of the boom.  If the winch is pedestal-mounted, a boom tip sheave is used at the tip of the boom to guide the winch line.  5.1.6.  The Digger.  The digger is the part of a digger derrick that does the actual digging.  The digger mechanism is a hydraulically operated motor that drives the auger.  It is attached to the boom by the digger hanger bracket.  5.1.6.1.  Auger.  The auger resembles a large drill bit.  It is the hole-boring tool of the digger.  It is connected to the shaft of the digger mechanism with a large pin.  They are made  in  various  sizes  for  different  types  of  jobs  (utility  pole  installation,  anchor installation, etc.).  Augers are changed by removing the pin and slipping the auger off the shaft of the digger mechanism.  5.1.6.2.  Auger Stowage Basket.  When the auger is not in use, it is stowed on the auger stowage bracket.  5.1.6.3.  Auger Hoist Line.  The hoist line is attached to a hook on the upper end of the auger.  When the auger is rotated slowly, it winds up into its stowed position.  The digger is held in place on the stowage bracket by a hydraulically operated stow lock pin.  Some digger derricks also have a mechanical pin, which is manually inserted to further safeguard the assembly.  5.1.7.  Digger Derrick Controls.  5.1.7.1.  Multi-purpose boom control.  The multi-purpose boom control can be moved in several different directions to move the boom up or down, extend or retract the boom, or rotate the pedestal to the left or right.  The farther any control is moved from the central, or neutral, position, the faster the function it controls is performed.  5.1.7.2.  Throttle pedal.  Located on the pedestal, the throttle pedal controls the speed of the truck’s engine which powers the hydraulic system.  When the speed of the engine is increased, the power to the hydraulic system is increased.  5.1.7.3.  Stow lock release.  Hydraulically locks and releases the stow lock pin, allowing the auger to be held in place on the auger stowage bracket or lowered for use. 5.1.7.4.  Dump valve.  Located within reach of the operator.   If one of the controls  sticks, the  operator  can  use  the  dump  valve  to  temporarily  stop  hydraulic  action.    When  the problem causing the stuck control is corrected, the operator returns the dump valve to its original position to restore hydraulic power.  5.1.7.5.  Outrigger controls.  Outrigger controls are located at the back of the truck.  They control the operation of the outriggers, which are a pair of hydraulically operated arms that can be extended out from the sides of the truck to the ground to help stabilize the unit.    5.2. Vehicle Inspection.  5.2.1.  Pre-trip vehicle inspection test.  Use Attachment 2 as a walk-around guide along with AF Form 1800.  5.2.2.  A Seven-Step Inspection Method will help ensure the inspection is the same each time it is conducted, and that nothing is left out.  See Attachment 3 for the Seven-Step Inspection Method.  5.2.3.  Types of Vehicle Inspection.  If discrepancies are found the operator must report them to Vehicle Control Officer/Vehicle Control Non Commissioned Officer (VCO/VCNCO), the supervisor, and/or vehicle maintenance:  5.2.3.1.

Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) = Truck Weight + Digger Derrick and Body Weight + Tools + Cargo Weight.  5.3.1.2.  Overhead clearance.  Check the clearance height of the vehicle relative to the overhead obstructions such as power lines and bridges.  Warning – Clearance distance requirements  around  electrical  liens/powerlines  vary.    Know  the  minimum  clearance distance based on voltage  IAW OSHA 1925.1408, Power line safety  (up to 350 kV) – equipment operations.  5.3.1.3.  Fall protection.  Fall protection should be provide IAW AFI 91-203, Chapter 13.  5.3.2.  Safety Clothing and Equipment:  5.3.2.1.  Safety steel-toed boots must be worn.  5.3.2.2.  First aid kit.  5.3.2.3.  Cones.  5.3.2.4.  Raingear, cold weather gear, etc.  5.3.2.5.  Reflective belt during hours of reduced visibility and on flightline.  5.3.2.6.  Hearing protection, if required.  5.3.2.7.  Fall protection, if required.  5.3.2.8.  Tire gauge.  5.3.2.9.  Fire extinguisher.  5.3.2.10. AF Form 1800.  5.4. Driving Safety and Precautions.  5.4.1.  Lift Capacity.  5.4.1.1.  Maximum Lift Capacity.    5.4.1.1.1.   Stability of the truck and the surface it is on. 5.4.1.1.2.   Structural strength of the derrick. 5.4.1.1.3.   Power of the hydraulic system.  5.4.1.2.  Actual Lift Capacity.  If the sheave height does not change, increasing the hook radius decreases the lifting ability of the derrick.  However, if the hook radius does not change, increasing the sheave height can increase the derrick’s lifting ability.  See the lift capacity chart for the specific digger derrick being operated.  5.4.1.2.1.   Hook radius.  The distance from the center of the pedestal to the boom tip sheave, measured in a line parallel to the ground.  The hook radius can change when the boom is extended, retracted, raised or lowered.  5.4.1.2.2.   Sheave height.  The distance from the boom tip sheave straight down to the ground.  As with the hook radius, the sheave height can change when the boom is extended, retracted, raised, or lowered.  5.4.1.3.  Boom Angle Indicator.  A boom angle indicator is a free-swinging device that indicates the angle to which the boom has been raised.  5.4.2.  When handling material never attach the load to the fall protection anchor.  5.4.3.  Never  lay  conductors  on  platforms  to  lift  them  into  position.    And  do  not  allow conductors or other objects to drag across the boom as this may cause gouges in the boom, compromising its strength, durability and insulating properties.  5.4.4.  Never overload the side load protection system, if equipped.  5.4.5.  Always stand firmly on the floor of the platform.  Never sit or climb on the edge of the platform.  Use fall protection, as required.  5.4.6.  Do not leave the controls unattended while a load is suspended.  5.4.7.  Operating on Slopes.  Digger Derricks are limited to their rated capacity with the unit set up on a maximum of a five degree slope.  Never operate a digger derrick on a slope of over five  degrees  without  the  appropriate  measures  to  level  the  unit.    If  the  slope  exceeds  five degrees, appropriate cribbing and blocking of outriggers may be required.  5.4.8.  Electrical Continuity.  Aerial devices and digger derricks with insulated booms can only isolate the operator from grounding throught the boom and the vehicle.  They cannot provide protection  against  phase-to-phase  or  phase-to-ground  contacts  occurring  at  the  boom-tip, above the insulated boom sections.  5.4.8.1.  Boom tips of aerial devices and digger derricks, of necessity, must contain metal components.  Metal conducts electricity.  Moreover, under certain circumstances, and to varying  degrees,  electricity  will  track  across  or  through  non-metallic  components (fiberglass covers and structures, hoses, etc.).  Electricity can even arc across the air.  Thus, the boom tip of an aerial dvevice or a digger derrick must be considered conductive.  5.4.8.2.  If any part of the boom-tip contacts an energized conductor, the entire boom-tip, including the control handle, must be considered energized.  5.4.8.3.  If  any  part  of  the  boom-tip  contacts  a  grounded  object,  the  entire  boom-tip, including the control handle, must be considered grounded.  5.4.8.4.  Hydraulic Fluid.  Hydraulic fluid is flammable.  If electricity flows through the boom-tip, it can cause the hydraulic fluid to burn or to explode.  Contact by any part of the boom-tip with an energized conductor while the boom tip is also in contact with another energized source or a grounded object can cause the hydraulic fluid at the boom-tip to burn or explode.  5.4.8.5.  Do not rely on the boom-tip to protect the vehicle from an energized conductor or a  ground.    Always  wear  insulated  protective  equipment,  use  conductor  cover-ups,  and maintain clearances when in the vicinity of energized conductors.  5.4.9.  Digging Safety.  5.4.9.1.  Corkscrewing.  The auger should not be allowed to catch in the ground and pull the boom down.  If this occurs, the digger rotation will need to be reversed.  Once the boom is moved up, it will free the auger.  5.4.9.2.  Personnel should never be allowed in the digger path when the digger mechanism is being lowered or stowed.  5.4.9.3.  Personnel should stay out from under the boom.  5.4.9.4.  Underground utilities.  Underground utilities should always be located according before breaking ground with a digger derrick.  5.4.10.1.   Use a spotter and hand signals.  See Section 5.4. and AFMAN 24-306.  5.4.10.2.   Back slowly and keep the spotter in view at all times.  5.4.10.  Backing.  5.4.11.  Parking.     5.4.11.1.   Apply the parking brake.  Chock the wheels. 5.4.11.2.   Set cones when parked.  5.4.12.  Boom Operation.  5.4.12.1.   Set truck on flat solid ground when operating the boom. 5.4.12.2.   Always face away from elbow when operating the boom. 5.4.12.3.   Beware where the elbow of the boom is in relation to other lines and objects.  5.4.13.  Boom Tip Electrical Continuity.  5.4.13.1.   When operating a digger derrick from a boom tip platform, all components at the boom tip including the controls must be considered to be electronically connected.  Use fall protection, as required.  5.4.13.2.   If an energized conductor object touches any part of the boom tip, treat the entire boom tip as grounded.  5.4.13.3.   The insulated portion of the boom can only isolate the operator from grounding through the boom and vehicle.  5.4.13.4.   The pole, cross arm, and other hardware must be considered by the operator as grounded.  5.4.13.5.   The unit cannot protect a person from current between an energized conductor and any other conductor, ground, or grounded equipment on or in contact with the pole including the neutral wire.  5.4.14.  Boom Hand Signals.  See Figure 5.1.  When it is necessary to communicate to an operator of a digger derrick, use the following hand signals.  Figure 5.1.  Boom Hand Signals.   5.4.15.

Operation Guidance Procedures.  5.5.3.1.  Always face in the direction that the boom is moving towards.  5.5.3.2.  Be aware of buildings, wires, and other objects in the path of the boom.  5.5.3.3.  When extending the boom, lower the wench at the same time.  5.5.3.4.  Pull the poles with a pole puller.  5.5.3.5.  Carry the poles using the pole trailer.  5.5.3.6.  When pulling the poles with the pole puller, center the truck on the pole.  5.5.3.7.  Rotate the turntable about three paces away from the pole.  5.5.3.8.  When lifting objects, follow the lifting specifications for the angle of the boom.  5.5.3.9.  When  lifting  the  transformer,  the  operator  should  adhere  to  the  lineman’s instructions from the bucket.  5.5.3.10.   When lifting the poles, the operator should be aware of where the butt of the pole is in relation to the truck and the head (top) of the pole in relation to the wires or the object in the path of the pole.  5.5.3.11.   When lifting poles near energized circuits, insulating protective equipment, such as line hoses, will be used.  5.5.3.12.   Ground man should be aware where the boom is in relation to the energized circuits.  5.5.3.13.   Ground man should be aware of objects in the path of the boom and the object being lifted.  5.5.5.  Lowering the auger.  The first step in beginning a dig is to lower the auger.  5.5.5.1.  Before unstowing the auger, fully retract the boom. 5.5.4.  Engine Operation.  5.5.4.1.  Use the lowest gear to get started and up-shift when engine speed is enough to handle the load in the next gear.  5.5.4.2.  Continue to up-shift until desired speed is reached.  5.5.4.3.  Operate at highest possible gear.  5.5.4.4.  Going uphill, down shift as required until engine can match demands of the grade.  Going downhill, use service brakes and gears in combination to keep vehicle speed under control.   5.5.5.2.  Raise the boom to about a 45̊ angle.  5.5.5.3.  Rotate the pedestal until the boom extends over the side of the truck so that the auger will clear the truck body, personnel and obstructions as it is lowered.  5.5.5.4.  If the winch is mounted on the pedestal, make sure that the winch line has enough slack so that it will not be a restriction when the boom is extended.  5.5.5.5.  Make sure that the boom is fully retracted so that the digger will engage properly with the extendable section of the boom when it is lowered.  5.5.5.6.  Remove the manual locking pin from the auger stowage bracket, if applicable.  5.5.5.7.  After making sure that all ground personnel are out of the way, rotate the digger counter clockwise just enough to take the strain off the digger stow lock.  5.5.5.8.  Open the stow lock.  5.5.5.9.  Slowly rotate the digger clockwise to lower the auger by unwinding it on its hoist line.  5.5.5.10.   Slip the auger hoist rope off the auger hook.  5.5.5.11.   After the auger has been lowered, the boom controls are used to position the auger over the location of the hole.  A spotter will guide the digger derrick operator.  The spotter will make sure that the auger is straight up and down.  5.5.5.12.   When releasing the auger, be careful not to put too much pressure on the sling.  Raise the boom to the size of the hole being dug at an angle.  5.5.5.13.   At the same time, flip the release switch and the dig switch.  Remember when the extension is out to keep aware of where the hook is.    5.5.6.  Digging the Hole.  5.5.6.1.  To dig the hole, the digger will be rotated clockwise with slight down-pressure is applied by the boom.  5.5.6.2.  Dig the hole down a few feet, raise and clean the auger.  5.5.6.3.  Repeat until the necessary depth has been reached.  Extend the boom as necessary in order to keep the auger straight up and down.  5.5.6.4.  Stow the auger. 5.5.7.  Stowing the auger.  5.5.7.1.  Attach the wind up sling.  5.5.7.2.  Rotate the boom so that it extends over the side of the truck.  5.5.7.3.  Make sure that the boom is fully retracted.  5.5.7.4.  Hook the auger hoist rope to the auger hook.  5.5.7.5.  Slowly rotate the digger counterclockwise to wind the auger up on the hoist rope.  It may be necessary to raise the boom slightly to keep the rope in place as it winds up.  5.5.7.6.  When the digger is in position on the stowage bracket, lock it in place with the stow lock.  5.5.7.7.  Replace the manual locking pin into the auger stowage bracket, if applicable.  5.5.8.  Setting the pole.  Setting the pole requires lifting it at or near its balance point.  If the procedure begins with the pole on the trailer, lifting can be done with the pole part-way off the trailer.  If the pole was delivered to the site and left on the ground, the pole must be moved close to the hole before it can be lifted properly by the derrick.  5.5.8.1.  Position the boom so that the winch line is aligned with the pole.  Attach tongs or other holding devices to the pole about 5 or 6 feet from the butt large) end of the pole.  Attach the winch line to the tongs.  5.5.8.2.  Raise the winch line to lift the pole 2 or 3 feet off the trailer.  5.5.8.3.  Swing the boom towards the hole, being careful not to take the pole completely off the trailer, so that the pole does not accidentally fall to the ground.  5.5.8.4.  Slowly lower the butt ends of the pole to the ground by lowering the winch line.  (The top end of the pole should still be on the trailer).  5.5.8.5.  Once the balance point is found and marked, the pole can be set by:  5.5.8.5.1.   Lift the pole at the balance point using the winch line.  5.5.8.5.2.   Rotate the boom until the balance point of the pole is over the hole. 5.5.8.5.3.   Position the steel choker just above the balance point. 5.5.8.5.4.   Lower the pole to the ground; remove the winch line from the tongs; and attach the winch line to the choker.  Then, remove the tongs from the pole.        5.5.8.5.5.   Open the pole grabber jaws. 5.5.8.5.6.   Slowly raise the pole with the winch line, and maneuver the pole to a vertical position.  When the pole is vertical, the bottom of the pole should be directly over the hole.  The pole grabbers are used to stabilize and maintain control of the pole. 5.5.8.5.7.   Slowly lower the winch line, and guide the butt end of the pole into the hole. 5.5.8.5.8.   After making sure the pole is straight up and down, replace the dirt and tamp it down. 5.5.8.5.9.   Remove the choker and detach the winch line.  Section 6—EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION.  6.1. Instructor’s Preparation.  6.1.1.  Establish a training location.  6.1.2.
