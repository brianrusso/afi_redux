Overview. 1.1.1.  This  manual,  in  conjunction  with  AFI  91-204  and  the  Air  Force  Safety  Automated System (AFSAS), directs procedures and provides guidance specific to the investigation and reporting  of  USAF  ground  mishaps  and  events  in  support  of  the  Air  Force  Chief  of  Staff (CSAF)  Safety  Program.  Commanders  are  responsible  for  developing  and  implementing  a safety  investigation  and  reporting  program  within  the  framework  of  the  Air  Force  Safety Management  System  (AFSMS).  Safety  staffs  assist  commanders  with  implementation  and integration of risk management into on-duty operations and missions, and off-duty activities. 1.2.  Waiver Authority. 1.2.1.  The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier ("T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3") number following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for a description of the authorities associated with the  Tier  numbers.  Submit  requests  for  waivers  through  the  chain  of  command  to  the appropriate  Tier  waiver  approval  authority,  or  alternately,  to  the  Publication  OPR  for  non-tiered compliance items. 1.2.2.  See paragraph 6.5 for formal report waiver procedures. 1.3.  Exceptions to Mandatory Reporting. 1.3.1.  Exceptions to mandatory reporting requirements are outlined in AFI  91-204, Chapter 1. 1.4.  Accounting for Losses. 1.4.1.  In addition to the guidance provided in AFI 91-204, the following shall be used. 1.4.2.  Record a military or civilian injury/loss to the command the individual is assigned to at  the  time  of  a  mishap.  Use  military  personnel  data records  and  civilian  payroll  records  to make determinations. Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel are accounted to their parent unit regardless  of status. Note:  Ensure mishaps are properly accounted for in AFSAS. The accounting base will not always be the base an asset (personnel or property) is assigned to. (T-1) 1.4.3.  Record a mishap occurring to an individual in any permanent change of station (PCS) status  to  the  losing  command  until  the  individual  signs  in  at  the  new  duty  station.  The “transfer effective date” is not criteria for determining the unit of assignment. (T-1) 1.4.4.  Record a mishap involving an individual in PCS status with temporary duty pending further orders to the organization originating the initial orders until the individual signs in at the next permanent duty station. (T-1) 1.4.5.  Mishaps  involving  Air  Force  personnel  assigned  to  non-Air  Force  organizations, Combatant Commands (CCMDs), other entities outside the Air Force and military members in  non-pay status  while  awaiting  an  appellate  review  (appellate leave)  or  court  martial  etc., are recorded to the Air Force at Large (AFAL). The Convening Authority (CA) will be the   6  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 MAJCOM, DRU, FOA or Wing investigating the mishap. The accounting organization will be AFAL. Note:  AFAL mishaps will be rate-producing at the Air Force level only. (T-1) 1.4.5.1.  Mishaps  involving  Air  Force  personnel  assigned to  Unified  Commands  will  be investigated and reported in AFSAS. Safety personnel responsible for reporting Unified Command  level  mishaps  must  have  a  secondary  AFSAS  account  in  order  to  input mishaps.  AFSEC  is  the  administrator  of  Unified  Command  level  mishaps.  The  host installation  (or  reporting  safety  office)  will  be  the  CA  for  those  mishaps  unless  the Unified  Command  has  safety  professionals  assigned  and  are  responsible  for  conducting ground safety mishap investigations. (T-1). 1.4.5.2.  Mishaps  involving  non-Air  Force  exchange  students  assigned  to  Air  Force organizations  are  recorded  to  the  AFAL,  however  will  not  be  a  rate-producing  mishap (ensure the Non-USAF radio button is selected when creating the mishap in AFSAS). (T-1) 1.4.5.3.  For  mishap  reporting  purposes,  personnel  in  a  non-pay  status  are  returned  to active duty when notified (written or verbal) to return to an Air Force installation. (T-1) 1.4.6.  When a unit makes an Air Force Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) or Government Vehicle,  Other  (GVO)  available  to  another  unit  on  a  recurring  or  permanent  dispatch,  the using organization is the owning command. Note:  Vehicles on receipt to, and operated by, non-DoD persons or agencies and activities such as the U.S. Postal Service or the American Red Cross are not GMVs. (T-1) 1.4.7.  For  all  mishaps  and  incidents,  ensure the unit’s/member’s  home  station  safety office (and  deployed  safety  representative,  if  applicable)  is  notified  and  receives  all  pertinent information as soon as possible. (T-1) 1.4.8.  Notify the nearest OSHA area or regional office within 8 hours of an on-duty mishap when  the  mishap  results  in  an  Air  Force  civilian  employee  fatality,  to  include  heart  attack victims.  For  any  in-patient  hospitalization,  amputation,  or  eye  loss  involving  an  Air  Force civilian  employee  that  occurs  within  24  hours  of  a  work-related  incident,  report  the  event within 24 hours of notification. If unable to contact the nearest OSHA area office or regional office within the required 8-hour time frame, contact the OSHA 24-hour toll free hotline (1-800-321-OSHA [6742]). (T-0) 1.5.  Determining Duty Status. 1.5.1.  Ground mishaps may occur in many different environments and duty status which are used as part of the determination for categorizing ground mishaps. The definitions in AFI 91-204  are  for  mishap  reporting  purposes  only  and  are  not  related  to  compensation  or  line-of-duty determination. 1.6.  Mishaps and Events Requiring Safety Investigations and Reports. 1.6.1.  Class A-D mishaps as directed by AFI 91-204. In cases where the mishap initial cost estimate is within 10 percent of the next higher mishap class for property damage, consider using  the  higher  class  and  issuing  a  status  message  reflecting  the  class  change  should  the mishap subsequently downgrade. This process will ensure the appropriate level of oversight and SIB composition is properly resourced. AFI 91-204, Chapter 1, provides the guidance for mishap and event classifications used to classify mishaps. (T-1) AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   7  1.6.2.  Class  E  Events.  Property  damage,  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration (OSHA)  recordables  but  not  Air  Force  reportable  (i.e.,  workplace  violence,  terrorist  acts, minimal stress and strain, etc.), High Accident Potential and near misses are the only events reported and/or recorded for ground safety and input into AFSAS. These events are deemed important to investigate and are used for trend analysis for mishap prevention. (T-1) 1.7.  Determining Injury Severity and Mishap Costs to Non-DoD Personnel and Property. 1.7.1.  Determine injury severity in accordance with AFI 91-204. (T-1) Air Force operations can  contribute to  or  cause  on-duty mishaps when Air  Force personnel are not  present. This determination  is  based  on  whether  an  Air  Force  action  or  inaction  is  totally  or  partially responsible  for  a  non-Air  Force  injury  or  property  damage.  The  loss  of  non-Air  Force property in an Air Force-owned house fire caused by faulty electrical wiring is an example of an Air Force operation that causes or results in damage to non-Air Force property (resident’s personal property). An example of the Air Force causing or contributing to injuries to non-Air Force personnel could occur when an Air Force member allows non-Air Force personnel to visit an industrial work area containing powered equipment and the visitor is injured on an unguarded piece of equipment. 1.7.2.  When determining injury severity or disability (i.e., fatality, permanent total disability and  permanent  partial  disability)  for  non-DoD  personnel,  the  investigator’s  best  judgment may be used if accurate information  from civilian  medical authorities is not  available. Lost time  for  injured  children  and  unemployed  adults  is  determined  by  assessing  the  degree  of injury  and  an  estimate  of  when  the  individual  may  have  been  able  to  return  to  normal activities.   8  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

While  expeditionary  SEG  will  often  perform  initial  investigation  and  courtesy reporting functions called for in Chapter 4 of this manual, mishap accountability is retained by the asset owner. (T-1) 2.9.3.  On-duty  Class  A  and  select  on-duty  Class  B  mishaps  requiring  a  SIB  will  be investigated by the owning MAJCOM IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 4. Close coordination with the theater safety office is crucial to ensuring all required traveling SIB members are properly vetted for theater entry. (T-1) 2.10.  Acquisition Program Office. 2.10.1.  For  system-related  Class  A  and  B  Ground  Mishaps,  the  Program  Office  with engineering  authority  for  the  system  will  support  the  mishap  investigation  by  providing analyses  of  hazards  that  contributed  to  the  mishap  and  recommendations  for  materiel  risk mitigation measures, especially those that minimize human errors. (T-1)   12  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 Chapter 3 INTERIM SAFETY BOARD (ISB) REQUIREMENTS 3.1.  General Information. 3.1.1.  The  ISB  is  convened  by  installation  commanders  to  provide  an  organized  evidence preservation response to mishaps within their area of responsibility before the arrival of the SIB. The ISB members are selected based upon their respective expertise within their normal professional  specialty.  It  is  not  within  the  ISB’s  charter  to  conduct  analysis  or  “solve”  the mishap. The ISB lays the groundwork necessary to ensure a successful investigation process is  accomplished  by  the  SIB.    For  further  information  on  ISB  duties  and  responsibilities review the following paragraphs and AFI 91-204, Chapter 2. 3.2.  ISB Interaction with the Disaster Response Force (DRF). 3.2.1.  The DRF is the Air Force structure that responds to disasters or accidents, establishing command  and  control  and  supporting  disaster  operations.  See  AFI  10-2501,  Air  Force Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations and AFMAN 10-2504, Air Force Incident  Management  Guidance  for  Major  Accidents  and  Natural  Disasters,  for  more information on the DRF, members of the DRF, and the roles of the Incident Commander (IC) and Recovery Operations Chief (ROC). 3.2.2.  Initial  Response.  The  IC  is  the  individual  responsible  for  all  incident  activities, including  the  development  of  strategies,  tactics,  and  the  ordering  and  release  of  resources. The  IC  has  overall  authority  and  responsibility  for  conducting  incident  operations  and  is responsible for the management of all incident operations at the incident site. 3.2.3.  The  safety  member  of  the  DRF  may  also  be  a  member  of  the  ISB.  Regardless  of additional  roles,  such  as  ISB  membership, the safety  member  of  the  DRF  should  act  in  the interest of the ensuing safety investigation, but not at the expense of their disaster response duties. 3.2.3.1.  DRF  Safety  members  must  understand  the  priorities  of  the  IC  immediately following a mishap are to rescue the injured, to prevent or minimize fire damage to the wreckage,  to  remove  wreckage  obstructing  essential  air  or  ground  traffic  or  rescue  and firefighting services, and to make the site safe. Access to the site for safety investigation purposes will be subordinate to those priorities. (T-1) 3.2.3.2.  Once  site  access  is  approved  and  coordinated  with  the  IC,  the  DRF  safety member  should  always  keep  two  goals  in  mind,  both  directly  relating  to  preserving evidence: site preservation and identification of witnesses for the ISB. 3.2.3.3.  The  safety  member  of  the  DRF  must  ensure  the  mishap  site  is  preserved  and documented by working with the IC to keep the mishap site as undisturbed as possible. (T-1) 3.2.3.3.1.  Unnecessary  vehicle  and  personnel  movements  must  be  curtailed,  since they can obliterate vital ground scar evidence. Single routes into and out of the area, enforced with cordons, should be established as quickly as possible. (T-1) AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   13  3.2.3.3.2.  Evidence must be left undisturbed if they pose neither a threat to survivors nor a hazard to the DRF; otherwise, it may not be possible to characterize damage as pre- or post-impact. (T-1) 3.2.3.3.3.  If  the  site  is  constantly  changing  or  subject  to  significant  changes  in conjunction  with  survivor  recovery  actions,  photograph  or  video  every  change  as  it happens. 3.2.3.3.4.  Be cognizant of changing weather conditions which can alter or obliterate evidence, such as ground scars. Document conditions and place protective coverings as needed. (T-3) 3.2.3.3.5.  When it is necessary to disturb the site to reduce site hazards, document the conditions prior to their disturbance whenever possible. (T-3) 3.2.3.3.6.  Consult  with  a  bioenvironmental  engineer  to  ensure  proper  personal protective  equipment  (PPE)  is  worn  to  protect  against  blood-borne  pathogens, composite materials and other potentially hazardous materials at the mishap site. (T-3) 3.2.4.  Recovery  Phase.  The  recovery  phase  begins  when  first  responders  have  completed emergency response and lifesaving actions. Once the emergency is over and recovery starts, control of the site is transferred from the IC to the ROC, who is a subject matter expert in the hazards or activities within the incident site. The ROC will likely be the person in charge of the mishap site when the ISB/SIB begins their evidence collection and investigation. The ISB BP will not assume the role of IC or ROC. (T-1) 3.3.  Preserving and Gathering Evidence. 3.3.1.  The ISB is not responsible for determining mishap cause. The sole purpose of the ISB is  to  gather,  preserve  and  protect  evidence.  The  ISB  investigation  is  normally  limited  to determining what evidence exists. The ISB only analyzes evidence when it will perish prior to  arrival  of  the  permanent  SIB  and  with  SIB’s  CA  or  SIB's  permission.  The  ISB  is responsible for: 3.3.2.  Notifying  the  owning  installation  of  the  need  to  collect  maintenance  and  personnel records. (T-1) 3.3.3.  Impounding  all  equipment  which  may  be  related  to  the  mishap  event.  The  items  of interest  to  be  impounded  are  typically  found  in  the  installation’s  MRP.  See  AFI  21-101, Aircraft  and  Equipment  Maintenance  Management,  and  AFI  91-204,  Chapter  5,  for  further guidance. (T-1) 3.3.4.  Collecting perishable fluids and photographing the mishap site. (T-1) 3.3.5.  Preserving  integrity  of  the  evidence;  ensure  only  ISB  members  have  access  to  the evidence pending turn over to the SIB. (T-1) 3.3.6.  Identifying  possible  witnesses  and  gathering  preliminary  statements  as  appropriate. (T-1) 3.4.  ISB Membership.   14  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 3.4.1.  ISBs  consist  of  multiple  members  to  perform  mishap  investigations.  Contractor representatives will not be primary members of the ISB. They provide technical expertise to the SIB. 3.4.2.  ISB Board President (BP). The ISB BP should be an O-6 or a GS-15 and a graduate of the AFSEC BPC. This individual will ensure all ISB members are briefed on restrictions in AFI 91-204, Chapter 3. (T-1) 3.4.3.  ISB Investigating Officer (IO). The IO is responsible for the daily management of ISB activities, investigation and preparation of preliminary/status messages. (T-1) 3.4.3.1.  Must be a fully qualified ground safety professional GS-9 (018 or 803) or higher, or 7-skill level (1S0X1) or higher. (T-1) 3.4.3.2.  Should  be  a  graduate  of  the  MINA,  Aircraft  Mishap  Investigation  Course (AMIC) or other formal civilian investigation training. 3.4.4.  The CA may appoint other technical experts for the ISB as needed to meet the needs of a specific mishap investigation, such as: 3.4.4.1.  ISB Maintenance Member (MM). It is preferred to select a maintenance officer or  Senior  Non-commissioned  officer  who  has  graduated  from  either  the  MINA,  AMIC courses  or  other  formal  civilian  investigation  training.  The  MM’s  chief  function  is  to assemble  as  much  information  as  possible  regarding  the  history  of  the  mishap,  this includes  but  is  not  limited  to,  automated  maintenance  records,  training  records  of maintainers, impound equipment, etc. 3.4.4.2.  ISB Medical Officer (MO) when medical/human factors are involved. 3.4.4.3.  ISB Vehicle Maintenance Officer/NCO when a motor vehicle is involved. 3.4.4.4.  ISB Security Forces Law Enforcement Officer when a motor vehicle is involved. 3.4.4.5.  ISB Fire Protection and Prevention Representative GS-9 (0081) or higher, or 7-skill level (3E7X1 or higher) when a mishap is fire-related. 3.4.4.6.  Program  Office  representative  for  system-related  Class  A  and  B  mishaps.  The Program  Office  will  provide  an  analysis  of  hazards  that  contributed  to  the  mishap  and recommendations  for  materiel  risk  mitigation  measures,  especially  those  that  minimize human errors. (T-1) 3.4.4.7.  ISB  Recorder.  This  individual,  normally  a  junior  officer  or  NCO  familiar  with administrative  duties,  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  administrative  and  logistical  needs of  the  ISB  are  met.  Extensive  experience  in  information  technology  and  computers  is extremely valuable for this individual. A recorder facilitates a timely and orderly process of evidence collection and transfer. The ISB recorder may be retained as the SIB recorder with CA and local unit agreement. (T-1) 3.5.  The ISB will ensure the following actions are accomplished. 3.5.1.  The ISB will not allow any piece of evidence to be reviewed, copied, tampered with, removed  or  modified  (e.g.,  vehicle,  equipment  or  training  records,  personnel  files, maintenance logs, etc.). All mishap participants will be kept separated to preclude collective reconstruction of mishap events. Interviews or witness statement collection will be conducted AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   15  on an individual basis. The integrity of each piece of evidence is crucial to the success of the investigation and the Air Force’s mishap prevention program. (T-1) 3.5.2.  Record  the  name,  office  symbol,  address,  e-mail  address  and  phone  number  of  each person  who  provides  records  or  evidence  (e.g.,  photos,  videos,  training  records,  etc.). Document source information for any photographs or videos provided including the date of the photograph or video. (T-1) 3.5.3.  Promise of Confidentiality. Only AF/SE or AFSEC/CD is authorized to grant promise of confidentiality. (T-1) 3.6.  Written and Verbal Witness Statements. 3.6.1.  The  intent  of  an  ISB  witness  statement  is  to  capture  witness  recollection  as  soon  as possible  after  the  mishap.  Promises  of  confidentiality  are  not  authorized  for  afloat,  motor vehicle,  off-duty  military  and  all  ground  mishaps  (see  the  exception  for  complex  systems, military-unique items, or military-unique operations or exercises in AFI 91-204, Chapter 3.). When this appears to be the case, contact AFSEC/SEG or AFSEC/JA who will forward your request to AF/SE or AFSEC/CD for approval to grant confidentiality to those witnesses. (T-1) 3.6.2.  Collect witness contact information (name, address, phone number and e-mail) for all individuals who provide a statement or are potential witnesses. All potential witnesses must be  identified,  logged  and  given  an  opportunity  to  provide  at  least  a  written  statement  as quickly as possible after the mishap. (T-1) 3.6.3.  If  witnesses  provide  statements  (written  or  verbal),  it  must  be  documented  by  using the Non-Privileged Witness Statement(s) (AFI 91-204, Figures A3.3 or A3.4). Read, record and transcribe the statement in AFI 91-204, Figure A3.2 for recorded interviews of witnesses. (T-1) 3.6.4.  When witness statements are solicited, it is  vital the ISB member  does not influence the witness’ recollection. The member conducting the interview must not lead the witness but rather  allow  the  witness  to  simply  recount  the  details  surrounding  the  mishap  as  he  or  she observed or experienced the events. (T-1) 3.7.  Evidence and Wreckage. 3.7.1.  Ensure all equipment associated with the mishap is impounded IAW AFI 21-101, if a DoD aircraft is involved, and AFI 91-204 and turned over to the SIB. The ISB should create an  inventory  list  and  transfer  it  to  the  SIB.  Coordinate  with  the  Maintenance  Group Commander  or  designated  impoundment  authority  to  ensure  vehicle  and  equipment impoundment  is  properly  accomplished.  Immediately  notify  other  bases  with  equipment  or items related to the mishap for impoundment, if required. (T-1) 3.7.2.  Coordinate  with  Incident  Commander  (IC)  to  ensure  access  to  the  mishap  site  is closely controlled. Only those with a legitimate need to be at the mishap site will be included on  the  Entry  Access  List  (EAL).  Additionally,  on  military  property,  and  when  possible  on civil  property,  photography  at  the  site  will  be  closely  controlled  to  ensure  no  inadvertent release  of  potentially  sensitive  photographs,  photographs  of  human  remains,  etc.  Non-ISB/SIB members who are granted temporary access to the mishap site will be escorted by an   16  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 ISB/SIB member who will ensure evidence is not contaminated and will collect all copies of the photos taken. The ISB BP will coordinate these requirements directly with the IC. (T-1) 3.7.3.  Photographic and Video Evidence. Digital and video images can be effectively used as evidence.  Keep  a  list  and  description  of  photos  taken.  This  listing  should  include,  as  a minimum, the location of the part(s) being photographed and what was photographed. Ensure all  images  are  properly  protected  from  release  to  the  public.  To  ensure  no  potentially privileged  or  inappropriate  photographs  (staged/diagrammed  photos,  human  remains,  etc.) are  inadvertently  disclosed  to  the  public,  all  mishap-related  photographs/videos  taken  by individuals who have  authorized access to  the mishap site must be approved by the BP via the CA prior to being considered for public release by the public affairs office. IC, ROC and investigators should ensure no unauthorized photographs/videos are taken within the mishap site. The host installation will provide digital photography support. Personal cameras and cell phone  photography  is  forbidden  unless  used  for  official  photos  with  BP  authorization.  For release authority of electronic images refer to guidance in AFI 91-204, Chapter 5. (T-2) 3.7.4.  If  wreckage  or  evidence  must  be  moved  due  to  operational  necessity  or  other circumstances  prior  to  the  SIB’s  arrival,  the  ISB  will  document  the  scene  as  thoroughly  as possible  using  mapping,  still  photographs  and  video  as  necessary.    Ensure  photo  or  video documentation  of  both  the  wreckage,  as  discovered,  and  the  removal  process  is accomplished.  (T-2) 3.8.  Medical Evidence Preservation. 3.8.1.  Ensure  toxicology  testing  is  immediately  accomplished  following  a  mishap,  if required or deemed necessary. (T-1) 3.8.2.  Ensure  to  obtain  initial  statements  and  information  such  as  the  72-hour  and  medical histories.  Great  care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  a  positive  chain  of  custody  for  all  human remains. If any chain of custody issues arise, contact the CA immediately. (T-1) 3.8.3.  Ensure evidence not associated with human remains is left undisturbed at the mishap site until the evidence is turned over to the SIB or when directed by the SIB President. (T-1) 3.8.4.  Ensure  medical,  mental  health,  family  advocacy,  pharmacy  and  dental  records  are collected and shipped to the SIB (as needed) for all involved personnel. (T-1) 3.9.  ISB President Hand-off Briefing. 3.9.1.  ISB President will conduct a hand-off briefing to the SIB. This briefing will provide a full  accounting  of  all  evidence,  both  on  and  off-station,  or  in  transit.  All  members  of  both ISB  and    SIB  will  be  present  during  the  briefing  unless  approved  by  the  SIB  BP.  Briefing should  also  include  ISB  actions  accomplished  to  date,  site  hazards,  etc.,  as  well  as  a  local area  safety brief. This should  be accomplished  prior to the joint ISB/SIB site visit  if one is conducted. (T-1) 3.9.2.  The  hand-off  briefing  should  contain,  as  a  minimum,  the  following  information  as applicable: 3.9.2.1.  Location/condition of the accident scene, including collateral property damage. 3.9.2.2.  Actions taken by first responders that affected the scene or wreckage. AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   17  3.9.2.3.  Location/condition  of  participants/survivors,  including  any  bystanders  killed/ injured. 3.9.2.4.  Status of toxicological testing, autopsies, etc. 3.9.2.5.  Next-of-kin notification status. 3.9.2.6.  Location/condition/status of wreckage, including all classified equipment. 3.9.2.7.  Presence  of  munitions,  composites  or  other  hazardous  materials  at  scene (including potential for blood borne pathogens based on presence of human remains). 3.9.2.8.  Civil authorities involved in managing scene/casualties. 3.9.2.9.  Status  of  records  impoundment  actions  (refer  to  individual  ISB  member guidelines below). 3.9.2.10.

Coordinate with the IC/ROC to update the mishap site EAL with the members of the SIB. This will expedite a joint site visit by the ISB and the SIB. Following the hand-off, all ISB members’ names will be removed from the EAL. (T-1) 3.9.4.  Once  the  hand-off  is  complete,  the  ISB  will  discontinue  any  involvement  in  the investigation or discussion of the mishap except when the SIB seeks further clarification. (T-1)   18  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 Chapter 4 DETERMINING INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSIBILITY 4.1.  General Information. 4.1.1.  As outlined in AFI 91-204 and in addition to the requirements outlined in this manual, the  installation  nearest  the  mishap  will  complete  the  following  actions  for  ground  mishaps. (T-1) 4.1.2.  Convening authorities, host and tenant organizations, in conjunction with safety staffs, determine investigative responsibility for tenant ground mishaps. In instances where the host is  not  the  asset-owning  commander,  the  investigating  safety  office  will  provide  a  courtesy report  from  the  safety  investigation  to  the  asset-owning  organization’s  safety  staff,  which will  in  turn provide  it  to  their  commander.  (T-1).  Ensure  commander  has  privilege  training before providing courtesy report IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 3. (T-1) 4.1.2.1.  Tenant units with an assigned safety staff will investigate and report that unit’s (tenant) internal mishaps. Note:  HAF, MAJCOM, AFOTEC and NAF safety offices are not configured as a traditional safety office IAW AFMS 106A and are, therefore, treated as a tenant unit without an assigned safety staff. (T-1) 4.1.2.2.  ARC tenants ensure host/tenant support agreements account for host support to the  tenant  when  requested  for  mishap  investigations  at  units  without  a  full-time  safety position. 4.1.2.3.  Fire investigators/personnel will investigate all fire losses to real property, wild land  fires  and  personal property (excluding  military  aircraft  flight-related  operations)  to determine point of origin and cause of the fire in conjunction with the safety investigation but  before  initiating  a  legal  investigation.  Point  of  origin  and  fire  source  determination shall be provided to the SIB/IO. (T-1) 4.2.  Safety Investigations Involving Air Force and Other Services. 4.2.1.  If  a  mishap  involves  materiel,  facilities  or  personnel  from  the  USAF  and  another Service  or  the  Coast  Guard,  the  investigation  will  be  convened  under  a  single  service’s procedures but conducted jointly and with joint membership in accordance with the current Inter-Service Memorandum of Understanding and DoDI 6055.07. (T-0) the  right 4.2.2.  Each  Service  reserves independent,  concurrent  safety investigations;  however,  the  joint  investigation  takes  precedence  with  regards  to  access  to evidence  and  witnesses.  The  involved  DoD  components  shall  determine  which  DoD Component  has  primary  responsibility  for  investigating  and  reporting  each  multiple  DoD Component mishap. (T-0) to  conduct 4.2.3.  The  CA  for  the  investigation  will  be  the  DoD  Component  experiencing  the  greater loss, although other factors such as operational roles and degree of involvement will also be considered. The convening DoD Component’s safety investigation directives shall be used in investigating and reporting the mishap. (T-0) 4.2.4.  Due to the unique deployed environment, the closest installation may not be the best suited  mishap  support  installation  to  comply  with  AFI  91-204,  Chapter  2  requirements.  In AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   19  these  cases,  AFFOR/SE  will  determine  the  best  suited  installation.  For  Class  A  and  B mishaps, AFFOR/SE will coordinate with the CA for release of involved assets. (T-1) 4.2.4.1.  Determinations  regarding  recovery  operations  and  mishap  site  visits  will  be made  by  the  battle  space  owner,  and  the  Air  Expeditionary  Wing  Installation  Control Center  (AEW/ICC).  During  this  phase,  images  of  the  site  made  by  intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets should be captured and preserved. (T-1) 4.3.  DoD Component Ownership. 4.3.1.  The DoD Component that is determined to have ownership of the mishap will account for all fatalities, injuries and property damage in that DoD Component’s statistics. (T-0)   20  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 Chapter 5 SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS 5.1.  General Information. 5.1.1.  Follow  guidance  in  AFI  91-204,  Chapter  5  as  well  as  this  manual  when  conducting investigations to determine reportability and the cause of ground mishaps. When a mishap is on-duty Class A or B or off-duty Class A, immediate telephonic notification will be made to the  owning  MAJCOM,  DRU  or  FOA  safety  staff  who  will  in-turn  notify  AFSEC/SEG. Regardless  of  mishap  class,  contact  AFSEC/SEG  through  MAJCOM,  if  it  is  suspected  the mishap involves classified information. (T-1) 5.1.2.  A  SIB  or  tailored  SIB  is  required  for  on-duty  Class  A  and  select  on-duty  Class  B mishaps.  The  SIB  is  the  primary  vehicle  for  conducting  a  safety  investigation  for  the purposes of mishap prevention. SIBs may be tailored as appropriate by the CA. The CA may request a waiver to these requirements by contacting AFSEC/SEG. (T-1) 5.1.3.  The SIB BP will ensure the SIB receives a hand-off briefing from the ISB to include an  updated  site  hazard  briefing  from  either  the  ISB  or  IC  prior  to  the  initial  site  visit.  The hand-off between boards marks the end of the ISB’s involvement in the investigation. Upon completion of the hand-off briefing, the SIB IO will remove ISB members from the mishap investigation in AFSAS. (T-1) 5.2.  Investigation Timeline. 5.2.1.  The  reporting  time  will  begin  upon  notification  to  the  safety  office.  The  safety investigation should be completed within 30 days of the mishap (See AFI 91-204, Table 6.1 for  reporting  time  lines  and  exceptions).  Table  5.1  is  a  typical  SIB  timeline.  If  the investigation  cannot  be  completed  within  this  30  day  period,  the  SIB,  tailored  SIB  or  SIO will submit a request for an extension in AFSAS to the CA for coordination and, if endorsed, to AFSEC/SEG for approval. (T-1) 5.2.2.  If the investigating command is different than the command that suffered the loss, the CA or their delegated agent, will coordinate prior to releasing messages in AFSAS. (T-1) Table 5.1.  Typical SIB Timeline. Day 1 +3 +10 +30 +40-50  Mishap, ISB Actions, Preliminary Message Release SIB Arrival 10 Day Status Message Finish SIB (Formal Report, Message, Tabs in AFSAS, etc.) Brief Convening Authority 5.2.3.  Investigation should be separated into three (3) 10 day periods. 5.2.3.1.  Days 1 – 10. The ISB/SIB preserves and gathers evidence, factual data related to the  mishap,  identifies  witnesses,  conducts  interviews,  and  accepts  custody  of  the AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   21  wreckage  and/or  evidence  as  applicable.  Upon  arrival,  the  SIB  BP  ensures  the  SIB receives a hand-off briefing from the ISB. (T-1) 5.2.3.2.  Days 11 – 20. Analyze evidence, factors and witness statements to determine the root cause of the mishap. Continue initial and follow up interviews and review of records (e.g.,  Maintenance  Records,  Medical  Records,  HFACS,  etc.)  as  necessary.  Begin  to deliberate and gather information together. (T-1) 5.2.3.3.  Days 21 – 30. Prepares the report which includes the development of a mishap synopsis,  narrative  and  investigation  and  analysis  outlining  the  areas  of  investigation, factors  accepted  with  rational  and  potentially  relevant  factors  considered  and  rejected with  rationale.  Investigators  may  use  illustrations  to  clarify  the  mishap  sequence  and events as necessary. Findings are the SIB’s conclusions after analyzing and deliberating on the facts; they represent the major events in the mishap. Causes are those findings that, singularly or in combination with other causes, resulted in damage or injury. (T-1) 5.2.4.  Once the SIB completes the investigation and finalizes the formal report and the final message,  the  SIB  will  provide  briefings  at  the  discretion  of  the  CA.  Refer  to  AFI  91-204, Para 6.5 for additional guidance. (T-1) 5.2.5.  The  CA  for  any  category  or  classification  of  ground  mishap/event  may  send  out  an immediate message to facilitate one-time inspections, groundings, time compliance technical orders (TCTOs), etc., if these are needed before the investigation and report are finalized. 5.3.  General Guidelines, SIB Composition and Qualifications. 5.3.1.  For all on-duty Class A and select on-duty Class B ground mishaps the CA normally convenes  a  full  SIB.  The  CA  may  convene  a  tailored  SIB  by  designating  a  specific  SIB composition. (T-1) 5.3.2.  The SIB member or SIO duties prescribed by this instruction take precedence over all other duties while the SIB is convened. SIB members will be relieved of all non-SIB duties while supporting the investigation. Table 5.2 establishes the minimum requirements. (T-1) 5.3.3.  Board  Presidents  may  request  additional  board  members  from  the  CA.  If  the  CA concurs with the request, the CA will source these members. The CA will identify additional members  as  necessary  to  thoroughly  investigate  and  document  a  mishap.  The  CA  may request a waiver to the minimum SIB composition requirements by contacting AFSEC/SEG to request an AF/SE waiver.  Note:  A CA may choose to convene a SIB for other than on-duty  Class A  or  B  mishaps.  If  so, the  CA,  in  consult  with  their  safety staff,  determines  the report format within AFSAS and the out-brief venue. (T-1) Table 5.2.

AFSEC will fund the representative. (T-1) 3. Specialized technical experts such as Human Factors, System Safety, Structural Engineer, etc., should augment the board, as needed, to provide technical insights as dictated by the mishap circumstances.   5.3.4.  Primary  SIB  Members.  “Primary”  SIB  members  determine  findings,  causes, recommendations,  and  are  authorized  to  submit  a  minority  report  if  they  do  not  agree  with the  BP  in  the  outcome  of  the  investigation.  Minority  reports  must  include  reasons  for disagreeing  and  will  include  suggested  findings,  causes  and  recommendations  if  different from those included in the report. Note:  Personnel deployed to combat billets in support of combat  operations  should  not  be  tasked  to  perform  Class  A  or  B  SIB  duties.  SIB responsibilities lie with the CA. Deployed safety personnel will perform ISB duties for Class A and B  mishaps requiring formal  boards until the arrival of the MAJCOM-convened SIB. (T-1) 5.3.4.1.

(T-1) 5.3.6.  Secondary  SIB  Members.  “Secondary”  SIB  members  assist  with  and/or  observe  the investigation, but are not authorized to submit a minority report. 5.3.6.1.  SIB  Recorder:  Should  be  a  junior  officer,  NCO  or  civilian  familiar  with administrative procedures. 5.3.6.2.  Add other experts as appropriate for mishap areas not included in this list. The BP or SIO will ensure a memorandum of acknowledgment for the protection of all data, including  privileged  data  is  prepared  and  endorsed  by  all  contractor  personnel  provided access  to  privileged  information.  (See  Memorandum  example  in  AFI  91-204,  Figure A3.9,  Memorandum  For  Contractor  Representatives  Serving  As  Technical  Experts  To Safety Investigations.)  Note:  When using expert consultants to assist the SIB or SIO in the  mishap  investigation  when  possible,  do  not  contract  with  representatives  of   24  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 contractors or companies who design, manufacture or maintain equipment involved in the mishap. (T-1) 5.3.7.  For all other mishaps: 5.3.7.1.  A ground or system safety member  GS-09 (0018 or 0803) or higher, or 7-skill level (1S0X1) or higher, may serve as the SIO for all ground mishaps other than on-duty Class  A  mishaps.  Member  will  be  a  graduate  of  the  MINA,  AMIC  course(s)  or  other formal civilian investigation training. Note:  A task certified 5-skill level (1S0X1) may be selected to investigate Class C and D mishaps and Class E events. (T-1) 5.3.7.2.  A SIO normally investigates Class C and D ground mishaps and Class E events. (T-1) 5.4.  Deficiency Reporting Procedures. 5.4.1.  If a SIO or SIB suspects that a component may be deficient, submit a deficiency report (DR) IAW T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System. Do not attempt field disassembly of the exhibit. (T-1) 5.4.2.  Category I DRs are normally submitted for Class A mishaps and Category II DRs are normally  submitted for Class  B and C  mishaps. See T.O.  00-35D-54 for  more information. Consider initiating a Category I DR for Class B or C mishaps and Class E events items, if a potential  exists  for  the  item  to  cause  a  future  Class  A  mishap.  If  required,  verbally  request priority  teardown  of  suspect  components  by  coordinating  with  the  Program  Office,  with engineering control of the component. 5.4.3.  If  assistance  is  required  to  determine  where  to  send  a  DR  exhibit,  contact AFSEC/SEG. In most cases, teardown and analysis will be conducted by a DoD facility. Do not  directly  contact  contractors  or  vendors  for  teardown  and  analysis  without  first coordinating with the Program Office or AFSEC/SEG. (T-1) 5.4.4.  Handle  and  ship  exhibits  according  to  T.O.  00-35D-54.  Use  T.O.  2J-1-18,  Engine Shipping Instructions, which explains how to mark engines for teardown. Ensure the mishap event  number  is  referenced  in  block  11  of  the  DD  Form  2332,  Product  Quality  Deficiency Report  Exhibit.  Enter  the  Deficiency  Report  Control  Number  into  the  mishap  narrative  in AFSAS. Include exhibit disposition instructions in all DRs (e.g., return exhibit to originator, convening  MAJCOM,  etc.).  Do  not  dispose  of  exhibits  sent  from  Class  A  mishaps  or mishaps  involving  potential  litigation  until  authorized  by  the  Air  Force  Legal  Operations Agency,  Claims  and  Tort  Litigation  Division  (JACC)  pursuant  to  AFI  51-507.  Store  these exhibits at either the facility that performed the analysis, or return the exhibit to the SIB or the  host  installation  commander,  as  appropriate.  Take  follow-up  actions  to  ensure  exhibits were received and teardowns are progressing in a timely manner. (T-1) 5.4.5.  Place  a  copy  of  all  teardown  reports,  including  all  supporting  documents  (e.g., metallurgical  analyses,  photographs,  test  reports,  etc.),  provided  in  response  to  DRs  in  the formal report. (T-1) 5.4.6.  The CA safety office takes follow-up action if the final safety report was sent before receipts  of  all  DR  responses  are  received.  If  final  exhibit  disposition  instructions  were  not included in the original DR, the CA  safety  office will provide them to  the Program  Office. (T-1) AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   25  5.5.  Ground Mishap Investigative Process. 5.5.1.  Once appointed, the SIB will relieve the ISB or IC as soon as possible, take control of the investigation and accept custody of all impounded evidence, lists of potential witnesses, etc. (T-1) 5.5.2.  The  SIB  or  SIO  will  provide  timely,  factual  information  to  the  CA  for  incremental release to the public through the Public Affairs office or designated official. (T-1) 5.5.3.  For investigations that involve fire, ensure fire personnel are engaged, either as a SIB member or as a technical advisor to the SIO, to determine the point of origin and cause of the fire. (T-1) 5.5.4.  The  SIB  or  SIO  must  maintain  a  working  relationship  with  the  IO  of  a  Commander Directed  Investigation  (CDI),  Ground  Accident  Investigation  Board  (GAIB),  Office  of Special Investigations, Security Forces, etc., to facilitate a thorough safety investigation. (T-1) 5.5.4.1.  On  some  rare  occasions  a  GAIB  and  SIB  will  be  working  concurrently  (high visibility  mishaps,  mishaps  with  fatalities,  etc.).  In  those  situations  IAW  AFI  91-204, Chapter  1,  SIBs  take  priority  over  any  corresponding  GAIB  investigations  and  the  SIB has "exclusive first rights" to witnesses and all physical evidence. If possible, the BP or SIO  should  formally  meet  with  the  legal  advisor  on  the  GAIB  at  the  beginning  of  the investigation  to  establish  a  working  relationship.  Review  AFI  51-507  prior  to  meeting with legal investigators for release information procedures. (T-1) 5.5.4.2.  Review privileged information criteria but do not discuss privileged information with the legal investigator(s). (T-1) 5.5.4.3.  Determine a debris recovery strategy, if required. (T-1) 5.5.4.4.  Review  the  process  for  planning,  coordinating,  approving  and  executing  tests that may alter or destroy evidence. (T-1) 5.5.4.5.  Review the processes for control of information in order to: 5.5.4.5.1.  Protect  information  from  unauthorized  release.  For  requests  to  release information  prior  to  the  release  of  the  GAIB  report,  consult  the  CA's  Staff  Judge Advocate's office in accordance with AFI 51-507, Chapter 7. (T-1) 5.5.4.5.2.  Maintain separation of factual and privileged information. (T-1) 5.5.5.  Control  information  access to  those  with approved access and  a  valid  need  to  know. (T-1) 5.5.6.  Only  release  impounded  information  and  evidence  when  no  longer  needed  for investigation purposes and the requirements of AFI 51-507 have been complied with. (T-1) 5.5.7.  The process ends with the completion of a final message report and, for on-duty Class A and B mishaps, a formal report (unless AFSEC grants a waiver). Once accepted by the CA, AFSEC reviews the report, issues a Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE) for on-duty Class A and select on-duty Class B reports and tracks open recommendations until closure. (T-1)   26  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 Chapter 6 REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS 6.1.  General Information. 6.1.1.  Reports  include  messages  (preliminary,  10-day,  status  and  final),  formal  and  non-formal. Prepare and submit reports IAW AFI 91-204, Chapter 6, this manual and Air Force Safety  Automated  System  (AFSAS).  For  continuity  purposes,  Table  6.1  establishes abbreviations to be used in all ground safety reports. (T-1) Table 6.1.  Standardized Abbreviations for Ground Safety Reports.

Preparing Messages. WX WIT W 6.2.1.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  AFSAS  is  the  primary  means  for  documenting  and distributing  all  messages.  In  the  event  AFSAS  is  not  available,  mishap  reporting  may  be delayed  until  it  is  accessible.  If  at  all  possible,  safety  reports  should  be  written  as unclassified. However, if classified information is relevant to the mishap, contact the CA for assistance  in  properly  marking  documents.  The  classified  appendices  must  use  the  same formatting  as  the  unclassified  tab.  Ensure  the  non-classified  tabs  reference  the  classified appendices.    Report  classified  mishap  information  via  Secret  Internet  Protocol  Router Network (SIPRnet). (T-1) 6.2.2.  Upon completion of the investigation, the SIB or SIO forwards the final message of all on/off duty Class A and on-duty Class B mishaps to the CA for approval and release.  For all other mishaps, the CA may delegate release authority. (T-1) 6.2.3.  Messages  are  sometimes  required  to  be  distributed  outside  safety  channels,  both within and external to the Air Force. When this is the case see AFI 91-204 paragraph 3.7.2 and 3.7.3, respectively. 6.3.  AFSAS Mishap Number. 6.3.1.  The  AFSAS  mishap  number  is  a  randomly  generated  six  digit  number  assigned  to  a mishap report upon initiation in the AFSAS database. The AFSAS mishap number is vital to tracking  safety  reports.  The  AFSAS  number  should  be  referenced  on  all  correspondence relating to a specific mishap (endorsements, classification changes, etc.). 6.4.  Framework of Reports. 6.4.1.  The  framework  of  a  report  contains  six  areas,  the  first  three  make  up  the  narrative: (Refer to Attachment 4 for additional guidance). (T-3) 6.4.1.1.  Brief  Synopsis.  The  brief  synopsis  is  a  condensed  statement  giving  a  general overview  of  the  mishap  to  include  the  outcome  of  the  mishap.  This  is  where  the individuals involved in the mishap will start to be identified as well as potential objects. 6.4.1.2.  Sequence  of  Events.  The  Sequence  of  Events  is  a  factual  description  of  the mishap sequence. It must be detailed enough for the reader to grasp significant events in the  sequence.  It  is  not  necessary  to  describe  every  detail.  Significant  events  may  occur months  or  years  prior  to  the  mishap.  Findings  will  come  from  the  sequence  of  events; ensure enough information is provided to support them. (T-3) 6.4.1.3.  Investigation  and  Analysis  (I&A).  The  I&A  is  broken  into  the  following  parts: Causal Factors, Contributing Factors, Non-factors, Non-factors worthy of discussion and an  optional  Conclusion.  The  I&A  must  clearly  explain  in  detail:    Areas  investigated, factors considered and accepted with rationale as to why they are considered and factors considered  and  rejected  with  rationale.  There  should  also  be  some  explanation  of  the logic  behind  recommendations  offered.  Factors  are  defined  as  any  unusual,  out-of-the   28  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 ordinary  or  deficient action  or  condition  discovered  during the  investigation  that,  in  the opinion of the investigator(s), contributed to the outcome or is indicative of a pattern of less than adequate decisions or conditions which recurs throughout the investigation. See Table 6.2 for a list of factors investigators should consider when investigating a mishap; the  list  is  not  all  inclusive.  Causal  and  contributing  factors  will  have  a  DoD  HFACS nano-code assigned, IAW AFI 91-204; (e.g., OP1’s BAC was .27%, [PC302 - Substance Effects]  or  W1  purposefully  ignored  a  caution  in  a  TO,  [AV003  -  Extreme  Violation  - Lack  of  Discipline].  This  provides  a  direct  tie-in  to  the  findings,  causes  and recommendations.  See  AFI  91-204,  Figure  A6.3,  DOD  HFACS,  for  a  complete  listing. (T-3) 6.4.1.4.  Findings. Findings are a summary of evidence  from the investigation. Findings list  essential  elements  in  the  mishap.  There  is  no  minimum  or  maximum  number  of findings. Findings are conclusions of the investigator based upon the weight of evidence, professional knowledge and good judgment.  Each is a single statement of one significant event or condition leading to the mishap.  Findings are arranged in chronological order; however,  there  can  be  time  gaps  for  non-relevant  periods.    The  objective  is  to  identify correctable events in sequence.  The chain of events leading to a mishap may start much earlier  with  design  deficiencies  or  improperly  written  directives.  The  findings  tell  the story of a mishap through the point where all damage or injuries have been accounted for.  Each finding is a single event or condition and should not contain more information than is  necessary  to  briefly  explain  that  event  occurrence.  Each  finding  must  have  a  logical connection to the preceding finding.  If there is a break in that logic chain the investigator has not correctly described the mishap sequence. Apply the “Finding Test” for validation IAW AFI 91-204, paragraph 5.10.13. (T-3) 6.4.1.5.  Causes. The cause of a mishap is the focus for prevention and leads directly to recommendations.  A  cause  is  a  finding  that  singularly  or  in  combination  with  other causes resulted in the damage or injury that occurred. All causes must be findings, but not all  findings  are  causes.  Findings  which  sustain  the  mishap  sequence  that  are  logical, normal,  or  expected  results  of  previous  causes,  are  not  causal.  For  example,  failure  to wear a seatbelt is causal but subsequent impact with the windshield in a crash is a result, not  another  cause.  Apply  the  “Reasonable  Person”  concept  to  all  possible  causes.  If  a person  could  be  reasonably  expected  to  react  as  they  did  in  a  situation,  given  what information  they  had  at  the  time,  that  person’s  actions  are  not  causal.  If  a  person  is trained in a certain way and they react to that training even if it is incorrect, the cause is the  training  not  the  individual’s  error.  Causal  findings  should  identify  the  causal  agent (who), the action taken (what), and (why) the reason for the deficiency. Why the action (or  lack  of  action)  occurred  should  be  fully  explained  in  the  narrative  and  may  be included  in  the  causal  finding.  For  example  “Due  to  organizational  training  issues,  W1 failed  to  properly  secure  OBJ1  to  V1.”  There  is  no  minimum  or  maximum  number  of causal findings. (T-3) 6.4.1.6.  Recommendations.  The  purpose  of  investigation  is  to  find  causes  and  develop corrective  actions  for  those  causes.   Therefore, recommendations  are  the  critical  part  of the  report.    For  this  reason,  all  causes  should  have  recommendations.    This  may sometimes be difficult but the investigator must make every effort to seek out reasonable corrective  actions.    Recommendations  may  also  apply  to  non-causal  findings.    This  is AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   29  particularly appropriate where a finding is the result of a previous cause but some action could be taken to mitigate the effects.  When developing recommendations consider who and  at  what  level  the  action  agency  should  be.    Always  structure  a  recommendation  to permit positive closing action.   Statements such  as  “Brief all personnel on this mishap” are  not  appropriate.  Recommendations  are  feasible  and  effective  solutions  to  eliminate identified hazards, or if the hazard cannot be eliminated, to mitigate the hazard’s potential consequences. If no recommendations are made in an on-duty Class A or B investigation, investigators will explain their rationale in the report narrative. Ensure the investigation supports  the  recommendations.  Do  not  make  recommendations  for  the  sole  purpose  of having recommendations. (T-1) 6.4.2.  Some conventions to follow: 6.4.2.1.  The  One-Liner three  parts:  What  happened?  What  was damaged/broken/injured?  What  was  the  outcome?  Note:    Do  not  include  privileged information. (T-1) includes 6.4.2.2.  Do  not  identify  involved  personnel  by  name.  Use  terms  like  Participant  1 (PAR1), Operator 2 (OP2) or Worker 1 (W1). The specific prohibition in AFI 91-204 is for  “involved  personnel”.  This  is  anyone  who  had  an  active  role  in  the  mishap,  was injured or whose action or inaction started or sustained the mishap sequence. (T-1) 6.4.2.3.  Persons  and  Objects  will  be  spelled  out  the  first  time  identified;  e.g.  Worker  1 (W1, AFSAS Person 1), 2014 Suzuki Hayabusa 1340cc, Vehicle 1 (V1, AFSAS Object 1) or utility pole, Object 2 (OBJ2, AFSAS Object 2). (T-3) 6.4.2.3.1.  It is acceptable to identify Persons in “plain language” after they have been identified (e.g. Person 1 as W1 throughout the report). The person may be written as W1 or Worker 1.  Reference Table 6.1 Standardized Abbreviations for Ground Safety Reports. 6.4.2.3.2.  It  is  acceptable  to  identify  Objects  in  “plain  language”  after  they    have been  identified  (e.g.  Object  1  as  OBJ1  throughout  the  report).  The  object  may  be written as  OBJ2 or  utility pole Reference Table 6.1, Standardized Abbreviations for Ground Safety Reports 6.4.3.  Do  not  include  information  identifying  the  specific  location  of  the  mishap  (e.g., Interstate 90 at exit 37 or at the intersection of Scott Drive and West Winters Street) as this has no value to the reader.  Instead include a clear and concise description of the location to include  anything  unique  so  the  reader  can  apply  the  lessons  learned  to  their  locations  for mishap prevention purposes. (T-1) 6.4.4.  Other  Findings  of  Significance  (OFS)  and  Other  Recommendations  of  Significance (ORS):    Significant  events  or  issues  discovered  during  the  investigation  that  have  safety implications but do not relate directly to the mishap sequence are OFS. These are placed after the findings, causes and recommendations as a separate category in the message or Tab T in the formal report. The recommendations  for other findings  follow the same rules  as  for the mishap sequence. (T-3)   30  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 Table 6.2.

Follow  guidance  in  AFI  91-204,  Chapter  6,  AFSAS  (including  AFSAS  User  Guide) and  this  chapter  to  prepare  and  distribute  ground  formal  reports.  For  exceptions  to  formal reports contact AFSEC/SEG through the MAJCOM. (T-1) 6.5.1.1.  Formal Report and Tab Waivers. 6.5.1.2.  On-duty  Class  A  and  B  mishaps  require  a  formal  report  unless  waived  by AF/SE. (T-1) 6.5.1.3.  AF/SE  will  normally  only  consider  waivers  for  mishaps  involving  known materiel deficiencies for which corrective actions have been established. (T-1) 6.5.1.4.  Waivers  will  not  normally  be  granted  for  mishaps  involving  personnel  factors (such as human performance failures or inadequate supervision). (T-1) 6.5.1.5.  Waivers  for  formal  reporting  are  processed  through  AFSAS.  Waiver  requests validated  by  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  Director  of  Safety  or  designated  authority  will  be forwarded  to  AFSEC/SEG  or  designated  representative  for  approval/disapproval  of  the request. (T-1) 6.5.1.6.  AF/SE  evaluates  each  waiver  request  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  considering  all completed  message  reports,  supporting  material  and  other  factors.  When  requesting  a waiver,  the  request  must  be  accompanied  by  a  STATUS  Message  entered  into  AFSAS that the PRELIMINARY/STATUS  MESSAGE  block  clearly  showing  the  mishap  sequence  of events, causal findings and proposed recommendations. (T-1) information  with sufficient all available includes detail in 6.5.1.7.  AFSAS.  SIBs  must  continue  preparation  of  a  formal  report  until  receipt  of AFSEC/SEG approved waiver. (T-1) 6.5.2.  Assembling the Formal Report. AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   31  6.5.2.1.  Formal  report  composition  and  format  are  detailed  in  Attachment  2  of  this manual and AFSAS. 6.5.2.2.  Safety  investigators  will  use  Tabs  as  necessary  based  on  the  category, complexity and other factors involved in the mishap. (T-1) 6.5.2.3.

and  Training  Mishap—An  afloat  mishap  associated  with  a  non-combat  military  exercise  or  training  activity  designed  to  develop  a  military  member's  physical ability, maintain or increase individual or collective combat and peacekeeping skills, and is due to either a mishap or the result of natural causes when the medical event occurs during or within 1  hour  after  any  training  activity  where  the  exercise  or  activity  could  be  a  contributing  factor.  This includes all training activities, including command-directed or compulsory physical fitness training, that do not meet the definition or are not included as values in sports, recreations, and individual fitness. Afloat  Industrial  and  Occupational—An  afloat  mishap  occurring  on  a  vessel  involving operations similar to those performed in private industry (such as boiler maintenance). Includes, but is not limited to, equipment maintenance, facility construction and maintenance, health care provision,  laboratory  research,  and  administrative  and  clerical  tasks.  A  mishap  that  occurs  on board  that  results  from  shipyard,  repair  facility,  or  private  contractor  operations  are  ground (industrial) mishaps. Afloat Miscellaneous—An afloat mishap not assigned to another subcategory. AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   39  Afloat  Mishap—An  Air  Force  mishap  occurring  on  board  or  resulting  from  or  during  the operation  of  a  DoD  vessel,  including  mishaps  during  DoD  diving  or  swimmer  operations; mishaps  occurring  while  loading,  off-loading,  or  receiving  services  at  dockside;  and  mishaps occurring up to the high water mark during amphibious or inshore warfare training operations. It applies to all injuries to DoD personnel occurring on board, whether or not job related. A mishap occurring on board which results from shipyard, repair facility, or private contractor operations is a ground (industrial) mishap, not an afloat mishap. Afloat Sports, Recreation and Individual Fitness Mishap—An afloat mishap associated with an activity that: Requires physical exertion and skill that is governed by a set of rules or customs and is often undertaken competitively; refreshes one’s mind or body through activity that amuses or  stimulates;  involves  the  activity  of  exerting  muscles  in  various  ways  to  keep  fit  through  the performance  of  exercise.  This  includes  all  fitness  activities  that  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for command-directed or organized fitness programs. Air  Force  At  Large—Used  to  record  and  account  for  losses.  Mishaps  involving  exchange students, military members in a non-pay status while waiting for appellate review if they have no written  or  verbal  orders  to  return  to  an  Air  Force  installation,  prior  service  personnel  on  leave before reporting to initial permanent duty assignment, Air Force personnel assigned to non-Air Force organizations, etc., are recorded to the Air Force at Large. Also, used for recording losses of  non-accepted  Air  Force  aerospace  vehicles  (AFI  91-204,  para.  4.9.2),  engine-confined  non-FOD  mishaps  (AFI  91-204,  para.  1.7.1)  and  aerospace  vehicles  leased  to  a  non-DOD organization  for  modification,  maintenance,  repair,  test,  contract  training,  experimental  ground mishaps and includes non-Air Force personnel when Air Force property or equipment fires cause injury. Air  Reserve  Components  (ARC)—All  units,  organizations,  and  members  of  the  ANG  and AFRC  on  active  duty,  on  active  duty  for  training,  or  in  drill  status,  and  ANG  and  AFRC technicians;  include  ANG  and  AFRC  property  and  equipment.  Military  status  starts  upon beginning duty for military pay and ends when duty stops. All references to Air Force military personnel and property also apply to ARC military personnel and property. Causal  Finding—Causal findings are those, which, singly or in combination with other causal findings, logically result in damage or injury. They are identified with the word "Causal" at the start of the text of the finding and supported by factors within the analysis. Cause—A  cause  is  a  deficiency,  which  if  corrected,  eliminated,  or  avoided,  would  likely  have prevented or mitigated the mishap damage or significant injury. Class  A  Mishap—The resulting total cost of damages to Government and other property is $2 million or more, a DoD aircraft is destroyed (excluding UAS Groups 1, 2 or 3), or an injury or occupational illness results in a fatality or permanent total disability. Class  B  Mishap—The  resulting  total  cost  of  damages  to  Government  and  other  property  is $500,000 or more, but less than $2 million. An injury or occupational illness results in permanent partial disability, or when three or more personnel are hospitalized for inpatient care (which, for mishap reporting purposes only, does not include just observation or diagnostic care) as a result of a single mishap.   40  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 Class  C  Mishap—The  resulting  total  cost  of  property  damages  to  Government  and  other property is $50,000 or more, but less than $500,000; or a nonfatal injury or illness that results in 1 or more days away from work, not including the day of the injury. Class D Mishap—The resulting total cost of property damage is $20,000 or more, but less than $50,000; or a recordable injury or illness not otherwise classified as a Class A, B or C mishap. A Class D mishap is any nonfatal injury or occupational illness that does not meet the definition of Lost Time. These are cases where, because of injury or occupational illness, the employee only works  partial  days,  has  restricted  duties  or  was  transferred  to  another  job,  required  medical treatment  greater  than  first  aid.  Loss  of  consciousness  (not  including  G-induced  loss  of consciousness,  which  are  considered  Class  E)  is  considered  a  Class  D  Mishap  when  they  are direct result of a nonfatal injury or occupational illness. Combat  Support  and  Training—A mishap associated with a non-combat military exercise or training  activity  designed  to  develop  a  military  member's  physical  ability,  maintain  or  increase individual  or  collective  combat  and  peacekeeping  skills,  and  is  due  to  either  a  mishap  or  the result  of  natural  causes  when  the  medical  event  occurs  during  or  within  one  hour  after  any training  activity  where  the  exercise  or  activity  could  be  a  contributing  factor.  This  includes  all training  activities  that  do  not  meet  the  definition  or  are  not  included  as  values  in  sports, recreation, and individual fitness. Note: The cause of death must be attributed to the mandatory physical exercise as determined by a competent medical authority. Convening Authority—The individual who has the authority to order a safety investigation. Courtesy  Report—A  mishap  investigation  report  entered  into  AFSAS,  in  part  or  whole,  by  a safety  staff  other  than  the  organizational  safety  staff  responsible  for  the  mishap  asset  (human, materiel  or property).   Any courtesy report will be finalized by the responsible safety  office of the  CA  and  the  accountability  will  be  adjusted  accordingly  before  the  report  is  deemed  final.  These  type  courtesy  investigations  and  reports  are  often  needed  for,  but  not  limited  to,  TDY, deployment, Joint Bases and off duty mishaps. Department Of Defense Civilian Personnel—DoD Civil Service System employees (including Reserve component military technicians (dual status), unless in a military duty status), non-dual status technicians, and non-appropriated fund employees. To avoid dual reporting this excludes military  personnel  working  part-time;  Corps  of  Engineers  Civil  Works  employees;  Youth  or Student  Assistance  Program  employees;  foreign  nationals  employed  by  the  DoD  Components; and  Army-Air  Force  Exchange  Service  employees.  Foreign  national  employees  fall  into  two categories:  1) Direct Hire – Under the direct hire system, the U.S. Forces are the legal employer of  the  foreign  national  and  assumes  responsibility  for  all  administrative  and  management functions with foreign national employment. 2)  Indirect  Hire— The host government serves as the legal employer of U. S. Forces’ foreign nationals.  Although  the  host  government  is  the  official  employer  for  the  foreign  national personnel,  it  grants  operational  control  to  the  U.  S.  Forces  for  the  day-to-day  management  of such personnel. See DoD 1400.25-M, Sub-Chapter 1231 for additional information. Department  of  Defense  Military  Personnel—All  US  military  personnel  on  active  duty  or Reserve  status  under  the  provisions  of  10  U.S.C.  (reference  (m)).

Fatal Injury (Class A)—Injuries resulting in death. Findings—Findings  are  the  conclusions  of  the  safety  investigator.  They  are  statements,  in chronological order, of each significant event or condition sustaining the sequence leading to the mishap. First Aid Case—Any initial one-time treatment and any follow-up visit for observation of minor scratches, cuts, burns, and splinters, etc., that does not ordinarily require medical care. Such one-time treatment and follow-up visit for observation is considered first aid, even though provided by  a  physician  or  medical  professional.  The  following  information  describes  those  cases  that would be considered first aid. Treatment outside this finite list is  considered medical treatment greater than first aid: -- Using a non-prescription medication at nonprescription strength (for medications available in both prescription and non-prescription form, a recommendation by a physician or other licensed health care professional to use a non-prescription medication at prescription strength is considered medical treatment for recordkeeping purposes); -- Administering tetanus immunizations (other immunizations, such as Hepatitis B vaccine or rabies vaccine, are considered medical treatment). -- Cleaning, flushing or soaking wounds on the surface of the skin. -- Using wound coverings such as bandages, Band-Aids™, gauze pads, etc.; or using butterfly bandages or Steri-Strips™ (Other wound-closing devices, such as sutures, staples, tapes, or glues are considered medical treatment). -- Using oxygen per protocol for suspected conditions or events (chemical exposure, smoke in a cockpit, decompression sickness, etc.). Note: Oxygen prescribed by a physician or medical professional for confirmed conditions constitutes more than first aid. -- Using politzer bag or comparable device for ear and sinus block.   42  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 -- Using hot or cold therapy. -- Using any non-rigid means of support, such as elastic bandages, wraps, non-rigid back belts, etc. (devices with rigid stays or other systems designed to immobilize parts of the body are considered medical treatment for recordkeeping purposes). -- Using temporary immobilization devices while transporting an accident victim (e.g., splints, slings, neck collars, back boards, etc.). -- Drilling of a fingernail or toenail to relieve pressure, or draining fluid from a blister. -- Using eye patches. -- Removing foreign bodies from the eye using only irrigation or a cotton swab. -- Removing splinters or foreign material from areas other than the eye by irrigation, tweezers, cotton swabs or other simple means. -- Using finger guards. -- Using massages (physical therapy or chiropractic treatment are considered medical treatment for recordkeeping purposes), -- Drinking fluids for relief of heat stress.

Government Motor Vehicle (GMV)—A motor vehicle that is owned, leased, or rented by a DOD Component (not individuals) primarily designed for over-the-road operations; and whose general purpose is the transportation of cargo or personnel. Examples of GMVs are passenger cars, station wagons, sport utility vehicles, vans, ambulances, buses, motorcycles, trucks, tractor-trailers, rental vehicles authorized by official travel orders, and General Service Administration (GSA) vehicles leased on a long- or short-term basis. Vehicles on receipt to, and operated by, non-DOD persons or agencies and activities such as the US Postal Service or the American Red Cross are not GMVs.  Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) Mishap—A motor vehicle mishap involving the operation of a GMV as defined in this instruction.  Government Vehicle Other (GVO)—Vehicles designed primarily for off-the-highway operation such as construction-tracked vehicles, forklifts, road graders, agricultural-type wheeled tractors and aircraft tugs.

Significant injuries or illnesses include those that do not result in death, days away from work, restricted work or job transfer, medical treatment greater than first aid, or loss of consciousness. Do not count the day of the injury/illness or the day the individual returns to work (these do not meet the definition of Lost Time). Note:  While 29 CFR 1904.5(b)(2)(iii) and 1904.5(b)(2)(iv) exempts reporting of certain occurrences that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting to an employee eating, drinking, or preparing food for personnel consumption, the Air Force requires reporting of these occurrences.  Observation or Diagnostic Care—Inpatient hospitalization or restriction from assigned work activities for observation or diagnosis provided no treatment or medication is given for the suspected injury or occupational illness, and a competent medical authority determines the AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   45  individual could have returned to his or her normal job without impairment or disability, or where an individual is temporarily restricted from regularly assigned duties to prevent exceeding time-weighted exposure limits. This care does not create a “lost-time case,” “no lost-time case,” or “first-aid case.  Occupational Illness—Any reported condition that does not meet the definition of injury. Any abnormal physical condition or disorder, other than one resulting from an occupational injury, resulting in adverse consequences and caused by occupational factors associated with employment.

Reserve and National Guard personnel performing inactive duty training will be considered off-duty: when traveling to or from the place at which such duty is performed; or while remaining overnight, immediately before the commencement of inactive-duty training; or while remaining overnight between successive periods of inactive-duty training, at or in the vicinity of the site of the inactive-duty training, if the site of the inactive-duty training is outside reasonable commuting distance of the member's residence. This definition is for mishap reporting purposes only and has no relation to compensability or line-of-duty determination. Personnel driving their private motor vehicle prior to or after their duty day are considered off-duty for mishap reporting purposes. Note:  A mishap involving both on- and off-duty military personnel in the same mishap will be categorized as an on-duty mishap.  On-Duty—DoD personnel are on-duty when: Physically present at any location where they are to perform their officially assigned work. Officially assigned work includes organization-sponsored events an employee is permitted to attend, regardless of location. This includes those activities incidental to normal work activities that occur on DoD installations, such as lunch, coffee, or rest breaks, and all activities aboard military vessels. Note:  Personnel walking to and from work place parking areas at the start and end of the duty day are in an on-duty status. Personnel who eat lunch and then deviate from normal lunch activities (example shopping) are considered off-duty. Being transported by DoD or commercial conveyance to perform officially assigned work. (This includes travel in PMVs or commercial conveyances while performing official duty, but not routine travel to and from work).  - On temporary duty, personnel on assignment away from the regular place of employment are covered 24 hours a day for any injury or occupational illness that results from activities essential or incidental to the temporary assignment. Essential or incidental activities include travel between places of business or lodging and eating establishments, drugstores, barbershops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, bowling centers, officer and enlisted clubs, gymnasiums, and similar on-base non-appropriated fund (NAF) facilities and similar places required for the health or comfort of the member, are considered on-duty. However, when personnel deviate from the normal incidents of the trip and become involved in activities, personal or otherwise, that are not reasonably incidental to the duties of the temporary assignment contemplated by the employer, the person ceases to be considered on-duty for investigation and reporting purposes of injuries or occupational illnesses. Injuries or occupational illnesses to personnel resulting from   46  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 activities unrelated to the temporary duty assignment or non-commander directed sports and recreation activities (e.g., jogging, golfing, basketball) will be reported as off-duty mishaps. Military members are working in part-time Non-appropriated Fund (NAF) positions. Note:  Use the NAF position series (instead of the military Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) for safety reporting. - Taking part in compulsory physical fitness training, sporting events, and physical fitness evaluation activities (including cycle ergo-metric testing when permitted). On-duty compulsory fitness training and activities include directed sports activities at professional military education (PME) and formal training courses such as Basic Military Training, Technical Training Schools, Airman Leadership School, Squadron Officer School and the Air Force Academy. These activities are considered on-duty when a superior directs participation at a specific location and time. This includes supervision-directed physical conditioning activities when a mandatory location and time are designated. Air Force civilian employees authorized to participate in physical fitness activities during normal duty hours are also on-duty. Note:  The definitions above are for mishap reporting purposes only and have no relation to compensability or line-of-duty determination.  Permanent Partial Disability (Class B)—Any injury or occupational illness that does not result in death or permanent total disability, but in the opinion of competent medical authority, results in permanent impairment through loss or loss of use of any part of the body.

Use them  to  show  damage,  impact  areas,  metal  fractures,  vehicle  travel,  etc.  Only  include photographs  aiding  in  understanding  the  mishap,  and  reference  them  in  the  analysis  in Part 2, Tab T. (T-2) A2.3.19.1.1.  Photographs  of  deceased  personnel  or  injuries  are  not  placed  in  Tab  S due  to  their  sensitivity.  They  will  be  placed  in  Tab  Y  if  they  support  findings  or recommendations. Medical pictures may be given to the GAIB. (T-2) A2.3.19.1.2.  Do not refer to privileged safety information on the page captions or in comments on the index. Photographs are privileged if they are staged for the board’s analysis.  Staged  photographs  are  placed  at  Tab  T  near  the  related  narrative. Assembling or reconstructing damaged parts or aligning parts to show failure patterns or impact marks are examples of staged photographs. Pointing with a finger or other device at a portion of wreckage does not make the photograph staged. (T-2) A2.3.19.1.3.  Hold all photographs and videos taken by the SIB, except those staged for analysis, for use by the GAIB. Every photograph and video needs to be labeled by   54  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 the  photographer.  If  a  DoD  photographer  is  used,  they  should  label  the  photo  with name, office symbol and office phone number. If a civilian photographer is used, then the investigator should label the photo with name, address and phone number (if the person will provide this information). (T-2) A2.3.19.2.  S2.  Civil  Engineering  Diagrams.  (Fallout,  Impact  Area,  etc.).  Ensure diagrams are self-explanatory. Include only those diagrams that add to the report such as wreckage  patterns,  impact  areas  or  route-of-travel.  Indicate  direction  with  a  northward pointing arrow on each diagram. If practical, indicate scale. (T-2) A2.3.19.2.1.  Ensure the diagrams do not depict the location of human remains. Such diagrams should be placed in Part 2, Tab X, of the formal report to protect the privacy interests of the decedent’s family. (T-2) A2.3.19.3.  The IO completes this Tab. (T-2) A2.4.  Part 2. Tabs T – Z, Board Conclusions and Non-Releasable Material. A2.4.1.  (Mandatory)  TAB  T.  Investigation,  Analysis  and  Conclusions.  Building  this  Tab creates the foundation  of analysis for the Formal  Report and a shortened version  should  be transferred to the final message to include sufficient analysis to support the investigation. All members of the SIB contribute to this Tab as applicable. The IO is responsible to complete this Tab. (T-1) A2.4.1.1.  DoD  HFACS  nano-codes  will  be  cited  in  Tab  T  and/or  the  mishap  narrative within the I&A. An example of how they will be reported is: "P1 was walking down the stairs  not  paying  attention  to  his/her  surroundings  and  tripped/fell  injuring  his/her  right leg  [PC101  –  Not  Paying  Attention,  Causal]."  Identify  causal  factors  and  contributory factors  using  DoD  HFACS  nano-codes  listed  AFI  91-204,  Attachment  6.  The  MO/HF member, if applicable, will contribute to the SIB’s efforts in writing the factors in Tab T and/or Mishap Narrative. Do not include names or identifying information in the table of contents;  however  it  is  acceptable  to  leave  the  name  of  the  individual  in  scanned documents. (T-2) A2.4.1.2.  Tab T Outline: Below is a recommended outline to help incorporate the SIB or SIO's  analysis  in  specific  areas  of  investigation:    (Note:    Tab  T  will  be  tailored  to  the specific mishap.)

OTHER FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF SIGNIFICANCE  T11.  AUTHENTICATION PAGE:  Include an authentication page after the last page of Tab T. Include each primary SIB member’s name, grade, position and date on this page. Have each concurring member, including primary members from other services on Joint Investigations, sign above their name for authentication of the report or for any changes to the report. If a final SIB or SIO message report needs to be changed after it is completed the authentication page must be updated and inserted in front of the original. (T-1)  T12. MINORITY REPORTS:  The primary members determine findings, causes and recommendations. Primary members who disagree with the results may submit a separate minority report. Minority reports will include reasons for disagreement, in a narrative format, and \list suggested findings, causes and recommendations if different from those contained in the original report. If a SIB member submits a minority report, their signature block still appears on the Tab T authentication page but they do not sign above it. Instead, they sign the minority report. (T-1) A2.4.2.  (Optional)  TAB  U.  Witness  Testimony  Provided  Under  a  Promise  of Confidentiality.  This  Tab  can  only  be  used  when  AF/SE  grants  approval  to  give  witnesses promises  of  confidentiality  in  a  ground  mishap  investigation.    When  confidential  witness statements  are  taken,  include  a  list  of  witnesses  interviewed  in  this  Tab.  Also,  include statements the SIB or SIO believe are pertinent. A2.4.2.1.  Transcripts of complete interviews must contain the agreements in AFI 91-204 for  written  or  recorded  statement  as  appropriate.  In  cases  where  witness  testimony  is summarized  by  the  interviewer,  it  must  be  clear  that  the  witness  was  advised  and understood the agreements. AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   57  A2.4.2.2.  Include  only  meaningful  statements  and  testimonies  in  this  Tab.  Place  the statements  and  testimonies  of  each  individual  together  in  chronological  order  with  the earliest  on  top  to  make  it  easier  to  compare  the  individual’s  impressions.  Consider  all statements and testimonies included in this tab in the analysis section of Tab T. A2.4.2.3.  The IO completes this Tab. A2.4.3.  (Optional)  TAB  V.  Other  Supporting  Privileged  Products.  Whenever  findings  or recommendations  involve  deficiencies  in  or  changes  to  T.O.,  checklists,  local  operating procedures  or  directives,  include  the  applicable  portions  of  the  original  publications  in  this Tab. The SIB’s/SIOs conclusion that a particular paragraph of a document was or was not a mishap  factor  is  privileged.  Place  highlighted  pages  or  publication  extracts  revealing  the deliberative process of the board in this Tab.  Include copies of submitted AFTO Forms 22, Technical Manual Change Recommendation and Reply, or AF Forms 847, Recommendation for  Change  of  Publication,  in  this  Tab.  Additionally,  statements  made  by  persons  found causal to the mishap should be filed in this Tab. The IO completes this Tab. A2.4.4.  Tab X. Privileged Photographs, Videos, Diagrams, and Animations. A2.4.4.1.  X1.  Privileged  Photographs.  Well-defined  photos  help  in  mishap  analysis. These typically include photos showing deliberative SIB analysis of the mishap damage, impact  area,  etc.  Ensure  diagrams  are  self-explanatory,  indicating  mishap  locations  in association with structures, facilities, etc. (T-2) A2.4.4.2.  X2.  Privileged  Videos.  Only  upload  videos  relevant  to  the  investigation  and make a reference in the Tab X .pdf document. (T-2) A2.4.4.3.  X3. Privileged Diagrams. Attach appropriate copies to all reports, if applicable. A2.4.4.4.  X4.  Privileged  Animations.  If  applicable,  include  the  final  version  of  the privileged animation and make a reference in the Tab X .pdf document. A2.4.4.5.  The IO completes this tab. (T-2) A2.4.5.  (Mandatory)  TAB Y. Summary of Injuries and Sensitive Medical Information. A2.4.5.1.  Summary  of  Injuries.  This  section  is  a  brief  narrative  describing  the  type  of injuries and mechanism of injuries. A2.4.5.1.1.  If photos of human remains are included in the report, they are placed in this  Tab  due  to  the  sensitive  nature  of  such  photos.  In  very  rare  instances  and  with HQ AFSEC/SEH approval, they may be included in Tabs other than Tab Y if deemed absolutely  necessary  to  define  injuries.  Otherwise,  use  injury  pattern  diagrams  to define injuries. (T-2) A2.4.5.2.  Sensitive Medical Information. Sensitive Medical Information  is usually non-privileged  information  and  can  be  provided  to  the  GAIB.  If  provided,  only  give unmarked  factual  documents;  do  not  give  sections,  pages  deemed  appropriate  to  the mishap or marked-up records as those would be considered the workings of the board and privileged.  Provide  the  GAIB  with  original  hard  copies  of  the  information.  Non-safety privileged  medical  documents  are  protected  by  other  laws  and  regulations  (HIPAA, Privacy  Act,  etc.).  Limit  sensitive  medical  information  in  Tab  T  and/or  the  mishap narrative  to  the  minimum  required  to  adequately  describe  the  role  of  a  diagnosis  or   58  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015 medication  in  the  mishap  sequence.  For  example,  a  mishap  member  is  found  to  have  a previously  undisclosed  irregular  heartbeat  being  treated  by  a  civilian  doctor  with amlodipine  (Norvasc).  If  this  condition  did  not  contribute  to  the  mishap,  this  might  be mentioned as an OFS in Tab T and/or the mishap narrative, but shall be summarized as “member  found  to  have  a  previously  undisclosed  heart  condition  being  treated  with  a medication  that  may  reduce  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure.”  This  Tab  may  spell  out  the diagnosis and exact medication in detail. However, if this condition directly contributed to  the  mishap,  then  the  details  may  be  needed  to  more  explicitly  explain  the  mishap sequence. For questions on where sensitive medical information may be placed, contact AFSEC/SEH. (T-2) A2.4.5.2.1.  Toxicology reports. Relevant toxicology test material will be included in this Tab. (T-2) A2.4.5.2.2.  Pre-Mishap  Medical  Information.  Include  scanned  copies  of  Armed Forces  Health  Longitudinal  Technology  Application  (AHLTA)  print-outs  of  all physical exams, most recent Physical Health Assessment (PHA), DD Form 2766, any active  waivers,  current  medications/supplements  and  the  person’s  current  serial profile. (T-2) A2.4.5.2.3.  Post Mishap Medical Information and/or Autopsy Report. If there are no injuries  sustained  in  the  mishap,  this  section  will  include  the  statement  “No  post-mishap injuries sustained.” Factual post-mishap physicals and/or autopsy reports must be  included  here.  Photos  of  human  remains  highlighting  fatal  injuries  may  be included  as  an  attachment  to  the  autopsy  report.  Also  include  factual  radiology reports and statements of prognosis. (T-2) A2.4.5.3.  The MO and/or HF member usually completes this tab or assists the SIB. A2.4.7.  (Mandatory)  TAB Z. SIB Proceedings and BP comments. A2.4.7.1.  Use this Tab to provide reviewing agencies about investigation difficulties and make recommendations for improving reporting and investigating procedures. Comments on technical assistance coordinated through AFSEC are also appropriate. (T-2) A2.4.7.2.  The BP and IO complete this Tab. (T-2) A2.5.  Part 3. Other Material. Part 3 is provided to upload the SIO/SIB Final Briefing in AFSAS.  AFMAN91-224  24 MARCH 2015   59  Attachment 3 MISHAP RESPONSE/INVESTIGATION KIT Table A3.1.  MISHAP Response/Investigation Kit.
