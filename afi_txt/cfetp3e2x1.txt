The CFETP will provide our people with a clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of our career field training. Note:    Civilian  occupying  associated  positions  may  use  Part  II  as  a  guide  to  support  duty  position qualification training.  The CFETP consists of two parts used by the supervisor to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. •  Section A provides general information about how the CFETP will be used. •  Section  B  identifies  career  field  progression  information,  duties  and  responsibilities, training strategies, and the career field path. •  Section C associates each skill-level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, and training). •  Section D indicates ressource contraints. •  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. Part II includes the following: •  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) to include duties, tasks, and technical references to support Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, and correspondence course requirements. •  Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if an Airman has satisfied training requirements. •  Section C identifies available support materials.   •  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses, and exportable courseware. •  Section  E  identifies  MAJCOM-unique  training  requirements  supervisors  can  use  to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. •  Section F identifies home station training references and courses material required for this specialty in support of contingency/wartime training. Note: At unit level, supervisors and trainers must use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this guide. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers.  This plan will enable us to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.

AFRC CMSgt selects must attend the Reserve component Chief Orientation Course (COC) prior to assuming the higher grade.  B3.  Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass  the  entire  spectrum  of  training  requirements  for  the  Pavements  and  Construction Equipment Operator career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  The following decisions were made by a career field STRT held at Fort Leonard Wood, MO on the 31st of August through the 3rd of September 2015.  B3.1.  Initials  Skills Training.    The  initial  skill  course  was  reviewed  for  content.    Additions, deletions, and modifications were made to the course.  Wartime training tasks were identified and validated.  B3.2. Five Level Upgrade Training Requirements.  Existing CDCs were reviewed and updated to ensure only current material remained and new technology information was added.  B3.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements.  Seven-level training requirements were reviewed and validated.   15 PART I CFETP 3E2X1, 12 October 2016  B3.4. Proficiency Training.  Any additional knowledge and skill requirements that were not taught through initial skills or upgrade training are assigned as continuation training.  Purpose of continuation training is to provide training exceeding minimum upgrade training requirements with emphasis on present  and  future  duty  positions.    MAJCOMs  must  develop  a  continuation-training  program  that ensures personnel in the Pavements and Construction Equipment Operator career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their careers. The training program will identify both mandatory and optional training requirements.  B3.5.  Supplemental  Training.    Subject  Matter  Experts  (SMEs)  and  the  Training  Committee reviewed supplemental training courses for technical accuracy and identified training that was no longer  required.    They  revalidated  the  remaining  courses  as  necessary  to  fully  support  career progression in the AFS.  B4.  Community  College  of  the  Air  Force  (CCAF)  Academic  Programs.    Airmen  are automatically  enrolled  in  CCAF  upon  completion  of  basic  military  training.  CCAF  is  one  of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it’s the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel. The college is regionally accredited through Air University  by  the  Southern  Association  of  Colleges  and  Schools  Commission  on  Colleges (SACSCOC)  to  award  Associate  of  Applied  Science  (AAS)  degrees  designed  for  specific  Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest multi-campus community college in the world. Upon  completion  of  basic  military  training  and  assignment  to  an  AF  career  field,  all  enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an AAS degree. In order to be awarded, degree requirements must be successfully completed before the Airman separates/retires from the Air Force or is commissioned as an officer. See the CCAF website: http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/ for details regarding the AAS degree programs: In addition to its Associates degree program, CCAF offers the following programs. Complete details can be found at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/certifications.asp. In addition to its degree program, CCAF offers the following:  B4.1. CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC) Program.  The CIC is a professional credential that recognizes  the  instructor’s  extensive  faculty  development  training,  education  and  qualification required to teach a CCAF course, and formally acknowledges the instructors practical teaching experience. Qualified officer, enlisted, civilian and other service instructors are eligible for this certification.  Complete  details  for  the  instructor  certification  program  can  be  found  at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/certifications.asp.  B4.2. The Professional Manager Certification (PMC).  This professional credential is awarded by CCAF and formally recognizes an individual’s advanced level of education and experience in leadership and management, as well as professional accomplishments.   The PMC is primarily designed  for  Air  Force  SNCO’s.    However,  any  enlisted  Airmen  who  meet  all  program requirements may be nominated and awarded the PMC.  Once an individual retires, separates or is commissioned,  they  are  no  longer  eligible  for  the  PMC.    Complete  details  can  be  found  at https://augateway.maxwell.af.mil/ccaf/certifications/pmc/.   16 PART I CFETP 3E2X1, 12 October 2016 faculty  and  professional  development.

AF COOL replaced the CCAF Credentialing and Education Research Tool (CERT). The AF COOL Program can be accessed at https://afvec.langley.af.mil/afvec/Public/COOL/Default.aspx. The site provides a research tool designed to increase an Airman’s awareness of national professional credentialing and CCAF education opportunities available for all Air Force occupational specialties. The AF COOL Program also provides information on specific occupational specialties, civilian occupational equivalencies, CCAF degree programs, and AFSC-related national professional credentials available to enlisted members through credentialing agencies and professional organizations. The AF COOL Program contains a variety of information about credentialing and licensing and can be used to:   B4.4.1. Get background information about civilian licensure and certification in general and specific information on individual credentials including eligibility requirements and resources to prepare for an examination.   B4.4.2. Identify licenses and certifications relevant to an AFSC.   B4.4.3. Learn how to fill gaps between Air Force training and experience and civilian credentialing requirements.   B4.4.4. Get information on Tuition Assistance and GI Bill eligible funding opportunities to pay for credentialing examinations and associated fees.   B4.4.5. Learn about resources available to you that can help gain civilian job credentials.  B4.5.  Trade  Skill  Certification.    When  a  CCAF  student  separates  or  retires,  a  trade  skill certification is awarded for the primary occupational specialty.  The College uses a competency-based assessment process for trade skill certification at one of three proficiency levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman/Supervisor.  All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.  B.4.6. Air University Associate to Baccalaureate Cooperative (AU-ABC).  AU-ABC directs Airmen with associate in applied science degrees from the CCAF to a collection of accredited “military friendly” colleges and universities to consider when completing a four-year degree. The program  maximizes  the  application  of  military  career  education  and  training,  and  provides  a multitude of online academic and support services for the enlisted member.    17 PART I CFETP 3E2X1, 12 October 2016 B5.

This section is reserved.”   32 PART II CFETP 3E2X1, 12 October 2016  SECTION A - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD  A1.  Implementation.  This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC Army ITRO Pavements and Equipment Apprentice and Air Force Unique Training courses with class beginning 19 October 2016 and graduating on or after 24 January 2017.   A2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS, Air Force Training Program, and in collaboration with the Civil Engineer, Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), it is mandatory for all civil engineers, regardless of duty assignment, to use an automated training record.  The automated training record currently being utilized to document upgrade and qualification training is an application located on the CE-VLC.  A2.1.  Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References). Lists the most common tasks, knowledge, and supporting technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  A2.2.  Column 2 (Core Tasks). Identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements) by an asterisk (*) in the appropriate skill level sub-column.  As a minimum, trainees must complete hands-on certification on all core, critical and diamond tasks for skill level upgrade.  A2.2.1.  Wartime Tasks.  All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks.  In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment.  A2.2.2.  Diamond Tasks.  Tasks identified by a diamond (♦) are considered contingency/war task and are critical to the career field.  Equipment shortfalls at most locations have created problems with actual hands-on certification of these tasks.  In instances where required equipment is not available for instruction, completion of the corresponding task AFQTP is all that is required for upgrade/qualification training.  A2.3.  Column 3 (Certification for OJT).  Used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training  requirements.    Use  the  automated  training  record  application  to  document  individual qualifications.    Task  certification  of  core,  critical  and  diamond  tasks  require  a  training completion date and initials of the trainee, trainer, and certifier.  All non-core tasks require training completion date and initials of the trainee and trainer only.  A2.4.    Column  4  (Proficiency  Codes  Used  to  Indicate  Training/Information  Provided).  Indicates formal training and correspondence course requirements.  It shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task, knowledge and the career  knowledge  provided  by  formal  courses,  web-based  training  (WBT)  and  AFQTPs.    See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit education and training manager for current CDC listings.  33 PART II CFETP 3E2X1, 12 October 2016  A2.5.  Qualitative Requirements.  Contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by WBT, resident training and career development courses.  A2.6.  Job Qualification Standard (JQS).  The STS becomes the JQS for OJT when placed in automated training application and used according to AFI 36-2201.  For OJT, the tasks in Column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  “Go” means the individual can perform the task without  assistance  and  meets  local  requirements  for  accuracy,  timeliness,  and  correct  use  of procedures.  AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  A2.6.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training.  A2.6.1.1.  Duty position.  Duty position requirements will be developed and identified by the workcenter supervisor and loaded into the automated training application.  Completion of core, critical and diamond tasks are mandatory for all duty positions.  Ensure the correct duty position title is listed under Profile 1 section of the trainee’s automated training record.    A2.6.1.2.  AFQTP Training and Documentation.  AFQTP or AFQTP assessments have been created for all core (*) and diamond (♦) tasks.  Completion is mandatory to fulfill task knowledge requirements for upgrade/qualification training.  Each AFQTP provides step-by-step procedures for the trainee, trainer, and certifier in completing each core or diamond task and instructions how to document the training in the automated training record.  A2.6.1.2.1.  Training.  Documentation of the start and completion of the AFQTP in the QTP section located in the automated training record is required for all core and diamond tasks.  The automated training record will not allow you to sign off any tasks in the JQS until the completion date has been entered.  Diamond tasks require the completion of the web-based course (with the review and post-test located in the program) or completion of the AFQTP assessment located on the CE-VLC to determine if the trainee has attained the knowledge level required.  Once the trainee has completed the web-based course or AFQTP assessment, the course completion certificate must be provided to the trainer/supervisor for documentation of the completion in the automated training record and completion of hands-on training, if the equipment is available.  A2.6.1.2.2.  Hands-On Training.  DO NOT sign off the tasks in the JQS until the trainee has completed hands-on/certification training.  For diamond tasks, if the equipment is not available at home station, the completion of the AFQTP or AFQTP assessment is the ONLY requirement for upgrade.  When the equipment becomes available either at home station or at a TDY location, the trainee can be signed off within the JQS section of the automated training record.  A2.6.2.  Transcribing from previous versions to the new CFETP.  Most items should transcribe automatically during the update of the new CFETP.  The UTM and supervisor must conduct a review of the new STS to identify any new core, diamond, or non-core tasks and add those tasks to their duty positions.  34 PART II CFETP 3E2X1, 12 October 2016  A2.6.2.1.  Previous training certification not listed  If previous training certification is not listed in the individual record, select the parent task to be transcribed, check the task title(s) block, and click on the transcribe button.  Enter the date of the original certification and sign off the task(s).  The  trainee  will  then  sign  off  the  task(s)  to  finalize  the  transcription  of  previous  training certification.  The automated application will place an entry into the trainee 623a and must be acknowledged by the transcriber and trainee.  A2.6.2.2.  Transcribing external training certification.  If a trainee attended a formal training course and received appropriate accreditation, select the 623 III section of the user automated training record and locate the course title in the master task list, then enter the completion date.  If the course title is not listed, contact the UTM to have it loaded from the master catalog.  If it is not listed in the master catalog contact the Force Development Manager at AFCEC to have it loaded in the master catalog.  A2.6.3.    Documenting  Career  Knowledge.    When  a  CDC  is  not  available,  the  supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all mandatory items specified in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).  For two-time CDC exam failures, the unit commander will take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201. Note: Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.  A2.6.4.  Decertification.  When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task, the supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title.  The supervisor shall select the Decertify button on the screen menu and enter a 623a comment explaining why the task was decertified, and then enter the Airman into qualification training.  The individual is recertified using the normal certification process.  A2.6.5.  Recertification.  When an Airman is required to be recertified on a previous task due to annual or bi-annual requirements.  The supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title and select the Recertify button on the screen and entry the dates the recertification was completed.    A2.6.6.  Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and certified to the “go” level. Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets the local requirements for accuracy, timeliness,  and  correct  use  of  procedures.  This  equates  to  a  3c  in  the  proficiency  code  key. AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures.  A2.7.  Specialty Training Standard.  The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests are developed at the USAF Airman Advancement Division by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based  upon  study  references  listed  in  the  Enlisted  Promotions  References  and  Requirements Catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, AF Military Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces. 35 PART II CFETP 3E2X1, 12 October 2016  A3.

Measurement.  Measurement of each objective is indicated as follows:  B1.1.  Written Test (W) indicates task or subject knowledge that is measured using a written test.  B.1.2.    Performance  Test  (P)  indicates  required  task  performance  that  is  measured  with  a performance progress check.  B1.3.  Progress Check (PC) indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check.  B2.    Standard.    The  standard  is  70%  on  written  examinations.    Standards  for  performance measurement are indicated in the objectives and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check or performance test, and students may be required to repeat all or parts of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  B3.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level, which means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.  B4.  Course Objective List.  These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by Blocks of Instruction.  A detailed listing of the initial skills course objectives may be obtained by written request to 364 TRS/DO, 727 Missile Road, Sheppard AFB TX 76311-2254.   37 PART II CFETP 3E2X1, 12 October 2016  SECTION C - SUPPORT MATERIAL  C1.

This area is reserved.”    41 PART II CFETP 3E2X1, 12 October 2016 SECTION F - HOME STATION TRAINING  F1.  Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to identify the tasks, training references, and training sources available in support of contingency/wartime training.  Civil Engineer forces will train to meet  the  full  range  of  tasks  expected  in  the  contingency  environment.    Training  ranges  from knowledge-type training conducted in a classroom, to task-oriented hands-on training conducted in the field.  These training requirements, frequencies, and sources are listed in AFI 10-209, RED HORSE Program and AFI 10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force (BEEF) Program.  F2.    Home  Station  Training  (HST).   HST is  knowledge-based  and  hands-on  training  that  is conducted  at  the  individual’s  home  station  for  contingency  operations.    The  CE  Commander ensures training is provided and documented and arranges for subject matter experts to conduct training as required. AFI 10-209, Attachments 2-6 and AFI 10-210, Attachments 2-6, identifies the personnel to be trained by specialty and frequencies.    F3.  Combat Skills Training (CST).  CST must be institutionalized as an integral part of any HST program.  Lessons learned from operations, such as IRAQI FREEDOM, have taught us the importance of maintaining a higher level of combat readiness.  Although the inclusion of combat skills-focused training into HST does not fully prepare CE personnel to work in a high threat combat environment, the steps taken to enhance training will help elevate units to a readiness level capable of supporting safe and effective operations in low to medium risk combat environments.  F4.  Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEET).  Wartime or contingency environments often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-essential equipment that civil engineers do  not  use  in  their  day-to-day  operations.    Due  to  the  cost  and  complexity,  mission  essential contingency equipment and trainer expertise are not commonly found at CONUS installations.  Personnel must be hands-on certified and the certification documented in their CFETP.  AFI 10-210, Attachment 4, identifies minimum number of personnel to be trained, positions by specialty, frequencies and Chapter 2 identifies the locations of training sites.  Inadequate training on these key equipment items can negatively impact Air Force contingency operations.  F5.  AF  Expeditionary  (ES)  Training  Requirement.    AETC,  as  lead  MAJCOM  for  AF  ES training, revamped ancillary home-station and advanced (mission specific) expeditionary skills training plans to standardize and synchronize training across the force.  Detailed requirements for AF ES training is available in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, Chapter 8.   F6. Training References.  F6.1.  AFI  10-209,  RED  HORSE  Program,  Chapter  3  and  Attachments  2-6  identify  the  RED HORSE recurring training requirements.   F6.2.  AFI  10-210,  Prime  Base  Engineer  Emergency  Force  (BEEF)  Program,  Chapter  4  and Attachments 2-6 identify the Prime BEEF recurring training requirements.   F6.3.  AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, Chapter 8 identify ES training requirements.   42 PART II CFETP 3E2X1, 12 October 2016 F6.4. Web-based Products.  Web-based products are available on the CE Virtual Learning Center (VLC) website at https://afcec.adls.af.mil.  Personnel completing these courses can receive credit for HST.  CBT products can be used in a classroom setting to train as many personnel as possible.  Attendance must be documented on a sign-in roster.  The sign-in roster must be maintained IAW AFI 10-210.       BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE OFFICIAL               JOHN B.

(Example:  b and 1b)   ** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.  − This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.   X - This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.   Note 1: BLK #4: Columns (1) & (2) can be relabeled to meet CF Requirements; i.e., 2 phase 3-skill level course, 5 level QTP  Note 2: One item, Grader, located in column 4 of the STS are not taught as part of this course.  The supporting knowledge/tasks and the associated behaviors found in the Army ITRO course will meet the needs of training for Air Force personnel.  This STS item will not include a proficiency code on this document but will be trained in the resident J9AQA3E231 04RA.  Pavements and Equipment initial ITRO course taught by the Army at Fort Leonard Wood, MO to a level that meets the requirements of the Air Force.  Note 2 is referenced as 2b/I in the STS in place of a proficiency code.

AFQTP Documentation Record.   A3.1.  To ensure each Pavements and Construction Equipment Operator trainee is trained to the correct standard a AFQTP has been developed for each core and diamond tasks identified in their STS.  These AFQTPs are mandated to be used by the trainee, trainer, and certifier in their on-the-job-training program for upgrade to the 5- or 7-level.  A3.2.  These AFQTPs ensures all aspects of the task is covered sufficiently and provide additional task knowledge in preparation for hands-on training.  AFQTPs summarize procedures on a task performance checklist for use by trainers, certifiers, and trainees.    A3.2.1.  The UTM or supervisor can download AFQTP's from the AFCEC – Air Force Civil Engineer Center Force Development (COF) portal page.    A3.2.2.  In additional to the paper-based AFQTPs there are web-based courses or assessments developed for certain tasks that are available on the CE-VLC under the specialty topic area.    A3.3.  Documentation.  Before a core or diamond task can be signed off in the JQS section of the individual automated training record the task must be signed off in the QTP section first.   A3.3.1.  Core/Diamond Tasks.  To document the completion the supervisor or trainer opens the individual automated training record, navigates to the QTP section, enter the start, and completed date with signatures.    A3.3.2.  Diamond (♦) Tasks.  Supervisors/Trainers DO NOT sign off the corresponding JQS task until the trainee has completed hands-on training.  If the required equipment is not available at your location, completion of the task’s AFQTP web-based course or assessment with a passing score  of  80%  is  all  that  is  required  for  upgrade  training.    Hands-on  certification  shall  be accomplished at the first opportunity when equipment is available and then can be signed off on the JQS.    61 3E2X1 Air Force Qualification Package (AFQTP) Documentation Record Attachment 3  CFETP 3E2X1, 12 October 2016  A3.4. 3E2X1 AFQTPs for Core and Diamond Tasks Requirements.
