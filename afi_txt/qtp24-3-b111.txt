Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. 5.4.2.2.4.6.6.  After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in one minute 5.4.2.2.5.   Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures:  5.4.2.2.5.1.  Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi.  5.4.2.2.5.2.  Run the engine at a fast idle.   16 5.4.2.2.5.3.  Air  governor  should  cut-out  the  air  compressor  at  about  the manufacturer's specified pressure.  5.4.2.2.5.4.  Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure.  5.4.2.2.5.5.  Compressor should cut-in at manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure.  5.4.2.2.6.   Test parking brake.  5.4.2.2.6.1.  Stop the vehicle.  5.4.2.2.6.2.  Put the parking brake on.  5.4.2.2.6.3.  Gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold.  5.4.2.2.7.  Test service brakes.  5.4.2.2.7.1.  Wait for normal air pressure.  5.4.2.2.7.2.  Release the parking brake.  5.4.2.2.7.3.  Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 miles per hour (mph)).  5.4.2.2.7.4.  Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal.  5.4.2.2.7.5.  Note  any  vehicle  "pulling"  to  one  side,  unusual  feel,  or  delayed stopping action. 5.4.3.

Types of hazards include:  Traffic during passenger loading/unloading operations and danger zone around bus (blind spots).  5.5.1.2.  Common operator mishaps:  Jerky starts and stops, traveling too fast, and cutting corners too sharply.  5.5.2.  Safety clothing and personal protective equipment (PPE):  5.5.2.1.  Safety steel-toed boots must be worn.  5.5.2.2.  First aid kit.  5.5.2.3.  Hearing protection, if required.  5.5.2.4.  Reflective belt, if required.  5.5.2.5.  Body fluid cleanup kit, if required.  5.5.2.6.  Warning triangles or flares.  5.5.2.7.  Inclement weather gear.  5.5.2.8.  AF Form 1800.  Note:  For day-to-day operations and normal use, the AF Form 1800 will be used to document any discrepancies found during the vehicle pre-inspection, during-use inspection and post-operation inspection.  As a part of the certification process, during the performance test, the trainee will not use the AF Form 1800 when accomplishing the walk-around inspection.  The trainee will only be allowed to reference the vehicle inspection guide (Attachment 2).     20 5.6. Driving Safety and Precautions.  5.6.1.  Bus operating principles.  5.6.1.1.  Must be aware of federal, state, and local laws.  5.6.1.2.  Provide safe transportation for passengers.  5.6.2.  Prohibited practices:  5.6.2.1.  Avoid fueling with passenger(s) on board.  5.6.2.2.  Never refuel in a closed building with passengers.  5.6.2.3.  Do not allow bus to be towed with passengers on board.  5.6.3.  Prepare to take control:  5.6.3.1.  Adjust the operator’s seat before operating the vehicle.  5.6.3.2.  Check/adjust all mirrors for maximum visibility before operating vehicle.  5.6.3.3.  Know the reference point (discussed later).  5.6.3.4.  Noise levels on the bus must be controlled:  5.6.3.4.1.   Wearing any headset receiver is prohibited.  5.6.3.4.2.   Radio at reasonable level.  5.6.3.5.  Must be in control of the vehicle at all times.  5.6.3.6.  Parking brake to be set whenever stopped for prolonged period of time.  5.6.4.  Reference-point driving, steps to determining reference points:  5.6.4.1.  Position comfortably in the operator’s seat.  5.6.4.2.  Pick an easily observable point on the hood or windshield of the bus.  5.6.4.3.  With the help of someone outside the bus (if possible).  5.6.4.4.  Conventional style bus - find point on ground where edge of hood lines up with point on the ground directly in front of it.   21 5.6.4.5.  Transit style bus - use some point on the windshield to mark the point on the ground in front of bus.  5.6.4.5.1.   Note that point for future reference.  Remember this point may change on different makes and models. 5.6.4.5.2.   This point will help determining proper distance to any fixed point:  5.6.4.6.  For determining reference points to the side or rear of the bus.  5.6.4.6.1.   Mark points on various outside rear view mirrors on either side of bus.  5.6.4.7.  To determine the point directly below the rear bumper:  5.6.4.7.1.   Use a point in left (or right) rear view mirror that lines up directly over bottom of left rear wheel well and rear bumper. 5.6.4.7.2.   Measure distance from this point on ground to edge of rear bumper. 5.6.4.7.3.   Remember to allow extra distance at any railroad grade crossing since trains overlap the track by about 3 feet.     5.6.5.  Overhead clearance.  5.6.5.1.  Common error by operators in not keeping overhead clearance in mind.  5.6.5.2.  Especially  when  getting  off  major  routes  (i.e.  parking  garages,  entrances  to motels/hotels, etc.).  5.6.5.3.  Loaded bus, overhead height is less then when bus empty.  5.6.6.  Tire changing safety:  5.6.6.1.  Consider  the  location  of  the  vehicle.    If  on  a  bridge,  curve  or  road  without  a shoulder, etc.; move the vehicle on a flat tire to a safe location.  5.6.6.2.  Ensure that there is a firm and level surface for the jack.  5.6.6.3.  Turn-on the four-way flashers, place warning triangles or flares prior to changing the tire.  5.6.6.4.  Block the front tires if changing a rear tire, or rear wheels if changing a front tire.  5.6.6.5.  Place the vehicle in “Park” if an automatic transmission, or low gear if a standard shift.  Apply the parking brake.   22 5.6.6.6.  Ensure  the  jack  is  rated  for  the  weight  of  the  vehicle,  and  ensure  the  proper placement of the jack (see manufacturer’s operator’s manual).  5.6.6.7.  If available, use jack stands after lifting the vehicle.  Once vehicle is lifted, never (at any time) get under the vehicle.  5.6.6.8.  Before removing lug nuts, ensure lug wedges are lose (double-check).  5.6.6.9.  After  changing  the  tire,  return  the  jack  and  lug  wrench  to  the  manufacturer’s operator’s manual recommended location.  Secure the damaged tire, and once the damaged tire is repaired, return the spare tire to the proper location.  5.7. Bus Operation.  5.7.1.  Start the engine:  5.7.1.1.  Do not pump the accelerator prior to starting a diesel engine.  5.7.1.2.  While engaging the starter, the trainee may use the accelerator pedal sparingly.  5.7.1.3.  Do not race the motor to warm up the vehicle.  5.7.1.4.  Check the instrument panel.  5.7.1.5.  Ensure that the vehicle is seen:  5.7.1.6.  Excellent safety practice is to turn-on the headlights when operating bus.  5.7.1.7.  If the bus is equipped with a strobe light, it will only be lighted when bus is being used as school bus.  5.7.1.8.  Use the hazard lights.  5.7.1.8.1.   When stopping at railroad crossings.  5.7.1.8.2.   Presence of a road hazard.  5.7.1.8.3.   When backing up the bus.     5.7.1.8.4.   Approaching a stop, touch brake pedal lightly before actually making stop.  23 5.7.2.  Warning lights:  5.7.2.1.  At passenger pick-up and drop-off stops.  5.7.2.2.  At railroad crossings.  5.7.3.  Shifting gears.  5.7.3.1.  Using engine speed.  5.7.3.2.  Use road speed.  5.7.3.3.  Knowing where/why to shift:  Steep grades/curves.  5.7.4.  Steering.  5.7.5.  Turning.  5.7.4.1.  Proper hand position or steering wheel.  5.7.4.2.  Wider turning radius due to length of vehicle.  5.7.5.1.  Check traffic to the front, rear, and sides.  5.7.5.2.  Check all mirrors, especially on the side next to the lane that the vehicle is moving into.  Note:  Check any blind spots for vehicles and/or pedestrians.  5.7.5.3.  Activate the proper turn signal at least 100 feet before the turn in an urban area and 200 feet before the turn in all other areas.  5.7.5.4.  Reduce the vehicle’s speed and downshift before beginning to turn.  5.7.5.5.  Never shift gears while making a turn.  5.7.5.6.  Always yield the right of way to pedestrians and other vehicles.  5.7.5.7.  When children are in the area, always use extreme caution.  5.7.6.  Right turns.  5.7.6.1.  Keep an eye on the right mirror while turning.  5.7.6.2.  Enter the right-most lane available:   24 5.7.6.2.1.   Leave enough room to make the turn.  5.7.6.2.2.   If the trainee must cross into another lane in order to make the turn, he/she should make lane crossover into the road that he/she is entering. 5.7.6.2.3.   Ensure that the turn signal is canceled. 5.7.6.2.4.   Steer the vehicle back into position.    5.7.7.  Left turns.  5.7.7.1.  Follow the same safety precautions as right turns.  5.7.7.2.  Refer to the left mirror while turning.  5.7.7.3.  Enter the left-most lane available.  5.7.7.4.  If multiple left-turn lanes exist, be mindful of proper lane usage.  5.7.7.5.  Ensure the turn signal is canceled.  Note:  Rear of the bus will swing out when turning.  5.7.8.  Braking.  5.7.8.1.  Controlling speed.  5.7.8.2.  Normal stopping effected by:  5.7.8.2.1.   Reaction time.  5.7.8.2.2.   Speed.        5.7.8.2.3.   Inclement weather. 5.7.8.2.4.   Condition of tires and brakes. 5.7.8.2.5.   Type and condition of road surface. 5.7.8.2.6.   Weight of bus.  25 5.7.9.  Backing.   5.7.9.1.  Minimize or eliminate the need for backing. 5.7.9.2.  Backing of any bus is strongly discouraged; however, if a vehicle must be backed, use a spotter.  5.7.9.3.  Stop immediately if the spotter moves out of the view of the mirror.  5.7.9.4.  Ensure back-up alarms are working properly.  5.7.9.5.  See AFMAN 24-306 for standard AF spotter hand signals and additional guidance on spotter safety.  5.7.10.  Speed limit.  Adjust speed based on time of day, size and passenger load, weather and road conditions.  Never exceed the posted speed limit.  5.7.11.  Do not leave equipment unattended with the engine running.  Shut-off the engine and set the parking brake.  5.7.12.  Transporting passengers. Note:    The  trainee  will  not  be  required  to  perform  a  passenger/student  discharge  during  the Performance Test, however, the trainee should demonstrate he is knowledgeable and competent in performing a passenger student discharge to unload/load passengers.  See Section 7.  5.7.12.1.   Overview loading/unloading passengers: 5.7.12.1.1.  Load/ unload passengers from curb side to the maximum extent possible. 5.7.12.1.2.  Be aware of personnel in the loading/unloading zone. 5.7.12.1.3.  Never exceed load/passenger limit.  Passengers should only be seated in the cab of the bus. 5.7.12.1.4.  Do not travel with the door(s) open.  5.7.12.2.   The bus must be in safe working condition, especially the following:        5.7.12.2.1.  Each handhold and railing.  5.7.12.2.2.

Approaching the stop to load passengers:  5.7.13.1.   Approach cautiously at a slow rate of speed.  5.7.13.2.   Look for pedestrians, traffic, or other objects before-, during-, and after-coming to a stop.  5.7.13.3.   Continuously check all mirrors.  5.7.13.4.   If the bus is so equipped, activate alternating flashing amber warning lights at least 200 feet or approximately 5-10 seconds before the school bus stop or in accordance with state law.  5.7.13.5.   Turn  on  right  turn  signal  indicator  about  100-300  feet  or  approximately  3-5 seconds before pulling over.  5.7.13.6.   Continuously check mirrors to monitor the danger zones for students, traffic, and other objects.  5.7.13.7.   Move as far as possible to the right on the traveled portion of the roadway.  5.7.14.1.   Approach passengers with extreme care.  5.7.14.2.   Bring  bus  to  a  full  stop  with  the  front  bumper  at  least  10  feet  away  from passengers at the designated stop.  This forces the passengers to walk to the bus so that there is a better view of their movements.  5.7.14.3.   Stop the bus parallel to and within 12 inches of the curb, if one exists.  5.7.14.4.   Place transmission in Park, or if there is no Park shift point, in Neutral and set the parking brake at each stop.  5.7.14.5.   If equipped, when transporting school children, activate alternating red lights when traffic is a safe distance from the school bus and ensure stop arm is extended.  Use hazard lights, if not equipped with alternating red lights.  5.7.14.6.   Make a final check to see that all traffic has stopped before completely opening the door and signaling passengers to approach.  5.7.14.  When stopping:  5.7.15.  Loading procedures:   27 5.7.15.1.   Check the position of all passengers and others in the area traffic.  5.7.15.2.   Passenger should not move until bus is at a complete stop.  5.7.15.3.   Do not allow passengers to cross a two-lane roadway until confident that all traffic is stopped.  5.7.15.3.1.  He/she should be aware that other motorists might not stop.       5.7.15.3.2.  Check vehicles behind the first vehicle stopped. 5.7.15.3.3.  Direct waiting passengers (or trainees). 5.7.15.3.4.  Ensure that the directions are clear. 5.7.15.3.5.  Take a mental inventory of passengers as they cross the roadway. 5.7.15.3.6.  Passengers are to use the handrail when boarding. 5.7.15.3.7.  Close service door to deactivate stop signal system as soon as possible.  Note:  Automatic/electric side doors can be misleading (fast and powerful compared to manual types).  Ensure all passengers clear of doors when shutting to prevent injuries.  5.7.15.4.   Check all mirrors:  Pay particular attention to areas close to the bus.  Ensure other pedestrians are out of the “danger zones.”  5.7.15.5.   All passengers must be properly seated.  5.7.15.6.   Account for all passengers.  5.7.15.7.   Never exceed the legal passenger capacity of the vehicle.  5.7.15.8.   Passengers load from back to front to help reduce accident and injury risks.  5.7.16.  Unloading passengers.  5.7.16.1.   Perform a safe stop as described above.  5.7.16.2.   Have passengers remain seated until told to exit.  5.7.16.3.   Check all mirrors.  5.7.16.4.   Account for all passengers while unloading.   28 5.7.16.5.   When  the  trainee  is  at  the  destination  the  following  should  be  told  to  the passengers:  5.7.16.5.1.  The location.  5.7.16.5.2.  Reason for stopping.  5.7.16.5.3.  Next departure time.  5.7.16.5.4.  Bus number.  5.7.16.5.5.  Remind riders to take carry-ons and trash with them.  5.7.16.5.6.  Remind riders of the step-down.  5.7.16.6.   At stops:  5.7.16.6.1.  Ensure the rider's safety as well as that of others.  5.7.16.6.2.  Activate amber lamps of the eight-lamp flashing signal system.  5.7.16.6.3.  Activate turn signals only to indicate a lane change.  5.7.16.6.4.  Come to complete stop before cracking the service door enough to activate stop arm and flashing red signal lamps.  Note:  Never open the service door fully to allow passengers off the bus until certain that motorists from  all  directions  have  stopped.    Check  the  right  rear  view  mirrors  to  ensure  no  vehicle  is attempting to pass the stopped bus on the right side.  5.7.16.7.   Check traffic again.  5.7.16.7.1.  When sure situation is safe, allow passengers to cross roadway.  5.7.16.7.2.  Instruct the passengers to constantly check for themselves.  5.7.16.7.3.  Determine where all passengers have moved once they leave the bus.  5.7.16.7.4.  Ensure that no person has moved back in front, or to the side of bus.  5.7.16.8.   Prepare  to  move  by:    Closing  the  door,  engaging  transmission,  releasing  the parking  brake,  turning  off  alternating  flashing  red  lights  or  hazards,  turning  on  signal, checking all mirrors, and allowing congested traffic to disperse.  Note:  Ensure no passenger’s backpack, drawstring, loose clothing, etc. has become hooked on the handrail or in the door.  Do NOT move the bus until all passengers are safe.  29 5.7.17.  Passenger supervision.  5.7.17.1.   Explain rules to the passengers prior to operation, once passengers are seated to avoid trouble later on.  5.7.17.2.   While driving, scan the interior of the bus.  5.7.17.3.   The trainee may have to remind riders about rules.  5.7.17.4.   If passengers become unruly:  5.7.17.4.1.  Ask for assistance from senior ranking passenger. 5.7.17.4.2.  Contact VOCC/VCNCO for assistance. 5.7.17.4.3.  As a last resort, contact the nearest security forces personnel. 5.7.18.  Force Protection Condition (FPCON).  5.7.18.1.   May be required to check identification cards as treat level increases.  5.7.18.2.   May be required to conduct a check of the bus to ensure it is secure.  5.7.18.3.   If the trainee finds any suspect items, do not touch or remove, notify the proper authorities.  5.7.19.  Cargo baggage guidelines:  5.7.19.1.   Watch for cargo or baggage containing hazardous material:  5.7.19.1.1.  Most hazardous materials cannot be carried on a bus. 5.7.19.1.2.  These items are NEVER to be transported on a bus:        5.7.19.1.2.1. Class A poison, liquid Class B poison, tear gas, or irritating materials.  5.7.19.1.2.2. More than 100 pounds of solid Class B poisons.  5.7.19.1.2.3. Explosives  in  the  space  occupied  by  people,  except  small  arms ammunition. 5.7.19.1.2.4. Radioactive materials. 5.7.19.1.2.5.

Emergency hospital supplies and drugs. 5.7.19.2.   Additional guidelines to follow:  5.7.19.2.1.  No items or personnel in a doorway or aisle.  5.7.19.2.2.  Secure baggage and freight in ways that avoid damage. 5.7.19.2.3.  Allow the operator to move freely and easily. 5.7.19.2.4.  Protect riders from injury if carry-ons fall or shift. Note:  Bags should not be stacked over backs of seats to prevent forward movement during hard stops or stacked so high they obstruct the view.  5.7.19.3.   Spare tire, jack and lug wrench.  If located in interior of bus must be securely fastened down.  This eliminates any possible projectiles.  5.7.20.  Railroad crossings.  5.7.20.1.   Trains always have the right of way.  5.7.20.2.   Stop  at  all  railroad  crossings.    Stop  the  bus  between  15  and  50  feet  before unmarked railroad crossings.  Note:  All buses MUST STOP at highway/rail grade crossing—whether carrying passengers or not. 5.7.20.2.1.  Open  the  forward  door  if  it  improves  the  ability  to  see  or  hear  an approaching train.  5.7.20.2.2.  Ensure another train is not coming in other direction on other tracks. 5.7.20.2.3.  Manual transmission - never change gears while crossing the tracks. 5.7.20.2.4.  First and foremost, know the height, length, width and overall size of the bus in relation to any railroad crossing encountered.  5.7.20.2.5.  Look for the following situation indicating railroad crossings. 5.7.20.2.5.1. A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device.  5.7.20.2.5.2. A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman.         31  5.7.20.2.5.3. A  railroad  train  approaching  a  highway  crossing  emits  a  warning signal.  5.7.20.2.5.4. An approaching railroad train is plainly visible.  5.7.20.2.6.  Operator  procedures  when  approaching  a  highway/rail  grade  crossing.  Know specific state laws concerning railroad crossings.  5.7.20.2.6.1. Slow down.  5.7.20.2.6.2. Require silence when approaching a highway/rail grade crossing.  5.7.20.2.6.3. All radios, tape players, etc. must be turned off.  5.7.20.2.6.4. Turn-off/down heaters and fans to hear adequately.  5.7.20.2.6.5.  Activate the hazard lights prior to the tracks:  5.7.20.2.6.6. 100 feet in an urban area.  5.7.20.2.6.7. 200 feet in a rural area.  5.7.20.2.7.  Scanning surroundings.

Engine Compartment Checks Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes Procedure 5.  Walk-Around Inspecting 7.  Final Air Brake Check • • o o o o • • o o Check air compressor drive belt condition and tightness (if compressor is belt driven). Check manual slack adjusters on S-cam brakes.  Note:  Vehicles with automatic slack adjustors still must be checked. Park on level ground and chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes in order to move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that can be reached. Check slack adjuster, more than 1-inch indicates adjustments required (vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on.  35 o o • o o o o o • o o o o • o o o Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time. If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate. • o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 o o o o • psi). Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure.  36  Section 6—TRAINER EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION  6.1. Trainer’s Preparation.  6.1.1.

Each encroachment will count as an error.    7.6.2.3.2.2.  Pull-ups.    When  an  operator  stops  and  pulls  forward  to  clear  an encroachment or to get a better position, it is scored as a pull-up.  Stopping without changing directions does not count as a pull-up.  The trainee will not be penalized for initial pull-ups.  However, an excessive number of pull-ups, will count as errors.  7.6.2.3.2.3.  Outside vehicle observations (Looks).  The trainee may be permitted to  safely  stop  and  exit  the  vehicle  to  check  the  external  position  of  the vehicle (look).  When doing so, the trainee must place the vehicle in neutral and set the parking brake(s).  The trainee is permitted to perform the “Look” inside the vehicle.  If  exiting  the  vehicle,  the  trainee  must  do  so  safely  by  facing  the  vehicle  and maintaining three points of contact with the vehicle at all times (when exiting a bus, maintain a firm grasp on the handrail at all times).  If the trainee does not safely secure the vehicle or safely exit the vehicle may result in an automatic failure of the basic control skills test.  7.6.2.3.2.3.1.  The maximum number of times that the trainee may look to check the  position  of  the  vehicle  is  two  (2)  except  for  the  Straight  Line  Backing exercise, which allows one look.  Each time the operator opens the door, moves from a seated position where in physical control of the vehicle; or on a bus walks to the back of the bus to get a better view, it is scored as a “look”.  7.6.2.3.2.4.  Final Position/inside parallel.   It is important that the trainee finish each  exercise  exactly  as  the  examiner  has  instructed.    If  the  trainee  does  not maneuver the vehicle into its final position as described by the examiner, the trainee will be penalized and could fail the basic skills test. 7.6.2.3.3.   Automatic  failures.    Automatic  failures  will  result  in  the  immediate termination  of  the  Air  Force  Performance  Test.    See  Attachment  4  for  a  list  of automatic failures applicable to the Basic Control Skills Test.  If a trainee fails any    48 component of the Air Force Performance Test, he/she will be required to retake the Air Force Performance Test, in its entirety.  7.6.2.4.  Road Test.  The trainee will be tested on his/her skill to safely operate the vehicle in  a  variety  of  traffic  situations.    The  situations  will  include  left  and  right  turns, intersections, railroad crossings, curves, up and down grades, single and multi-lane roads, streets and highways.  The examiner will tell the trainee where to drive. 7.6.2.4.1.   The following maneuvers will be demonstrated on the on the road test (See the Section 13 of the AAMVA CDL Manual and Attachment 4 of this AFQTP for additional guidance and detailed descriptions of each maneuver.):   7.6.2.4.1.1.  Turns (Left/Right).  7.6.2.4.1.2.  Intersections.  7.6.2.4.1.3.  Urban/rural straight.  7.6.2.4.1.4.  Expressway.  7.6.2.4.1.5.  Start/stop.  7.6.2.4.1.6.  Curves (Left/Right).  7.6.2.4.1.7.  Upgrades.  7.6.2.4.1.8.  Downgrades.  7.6.2.4.1.9.  Railroad crossing/simulated.  7.6.2.4.1.10.  Bridge/overpass.   7.6.2.4.2.   Road Test scoring.  For detailed descriptions and scoring expectations of each maneuver, see the Section 13 of the AAMVA CDL Manual and Attachment 4 of this lesson plan. 7.6.2.4.3.   Automatic  failures.    Automatic  failures  will  result  in  the  immediate termination  of  the  Air  Force  Performance  Test.    See  Attachment  4  for  a  list  of automatic failures applicable to the Road Test.  If a trainee fails any component of the Performance Test, he/she will be required to retake the Performance Test, in its entirety.  49  7.6.3.  During the performance test, the examiner will:  7.6.3.1.  Ensure safety at all times.  Note:  Stop training when safety items are violated.  Proceed  only  when  the  trainee  fully  understands  how  to  avoid  repeating  the  safety infraction(s).   7.6.3.1.1.   Chock wheel (if required) when bus is parked.  7.6.3.1.2.   Remove all jewelry and identification tags.  7.6.3.1.3.   Personal protective equipment and safety equipment. 7.6.3.1.4.   First aid kit.  7.6.3.1.5.   Warning triangles.  7.6.3.1.6.

Desired Learning Outcome.  A3.1.1.   Understand the safety precautions to be followed pre-, during-, and post-operation of the bus.  A3.1.2.   Understand the purpose of the bus and their role in the mission.  A3.1.3.   Know  the  proper  operator  maintenance  procedures  of  the  bus,  IAW  applicable technical orders and use of AF Form 1800.  A3.1.4.   Safely and proficiently operate the bus. Note:    The  performance  test  (in  addition  to  the  required  written  test(s))  is  the  only  official evaluation used to license the individual on the bus.  This checklist provides the minimum required items that will be tested during the performance test for installations that have not transitioned to the AAMVA model.  This checklist also is a training tool intended to assist the trainer in preparing the trainee for being evaluated and licensed to operate the bus through the Air Force Performance Test administered by the TVO Examiner.   A3.2.   Instructions.  Before the examiner begins the bus performance test, the examiner will brief the trainee on the scenario the trainee will need to accomplish.  The trainee will be given additional directions and instructions as needed as the trainee proceeds through the scenario.  A3.3.   Scoring.  A3.3.1.   The examiner will be scoring the trainee on bus operations and also the general safe driving  practices.    The  examiner  will  give  directions  and  instructions  to  the  trainee  in sufficient time for the trainee to execute a driving maneuver.  The trainee will not be asked to drive in an unsafe manner.  A3.3.2.   The examiner will be making various marks on the bus performance test checklist.  This does not necessarily mean that the trainee has done anything wrong.  It is in the trainee’s best  interest  to  concentrate  on  the  operation  of  the  bus.    The  examiner  will  explain  the evaluation results to the trainee at the conclusion of the bus performance test.  A3.3.3.   Tasks being evaluated are listed on the following page.  A3.3.4.   The examiner will stop the performance test at any time safe bus operations are not being followed or as deemed necessary for safety concerns.   54 Figure A3.1.

Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes Step 2.  Engine Compartment Checks 5.  Walk-Around Inspecting 7.  Final Air Brake Check Procedure Check air compressor drive belt condition and tightness (if compressor is belt driven). Check manual slack adjusters on S-cam brakes.  Note:  Vehicles with automatic slack adjustors still must be checked. Park on level ground and chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes so the operator can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that it can be reached. Check slack adjuster, more than 1-inch indicates adjustments required (vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. • • o o o o • • o o o o • o o o  80 o o • o o o o • o o o o o o   • Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time. If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate. • o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 o o o o • psi). Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure. Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Compressor should cut-in at manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure. Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. Wait for normal air pressure. Release the parking brake.  81 • • • Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action. 82
