Purpose.  This instruction provides Air Force guidance and procedures for purchases using MIPRs, DD Form 448 and Acceptance of MIPR, DD Form 448-2. This instruction supersedes all Air Force MIPR guidance and applies to all Air Force organizations including Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard. 1.2.  Air Force MIPR Policy.  The policies, procedures, reviews, and approvals put forth in this instruction  apply  to  all  DD  Forms  448  and  MIPR  requirements  packages  regardless  of  dollar value, purpose, and operating/contingency locations. 1.2.1.  Acquisition  planning  includes  developing  the  overall  strategy  for  managing  the acquisition.  Therefore,  before  requesting  the  assistance  of  a  servicing  agency  to  perform acquisition  activities,  the  Air  Force  requesting  agency  shall  determine  that  an  assisted acquisition is needed (e.g., expertise or acquisition resources are not readily available within the agency) and a servicing agency can provide the assistance required.  (T-1). The decision to  use  an  interagency  agreement  is  supported  by  a  best  interest  determination.  Refer  to Attachment 7, Interagency Acquisition Determination and Findings. 1.2.2.  MIPRs are supported by  a written  and signed agreement between  the requesting and the performing agencies.  The MIPR and Acceptance attached in  FMSuite Open Document Analysis (ODA) Module and attached to the MIPR when processed in DEAMS until Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) or G-Invoicing is fully deployed. 1.2.3.  MIPRs may not be used to violate provisions of law or to circumvent conditions and limitations imposed on the use of funds. For example, MIPRs may not be used to extend the period of availability of the cited funds. 1.2.4.  MIPRs  cannot  be  written  based  on  another  MIPR  funding  (‘MIPR-on-MIPR’).    A MIPR  is  a  request  for  a  service  or  item.    If  your  office  has  been  designated  as  a  primary office  for  a  specific  product,  then  the  actual  funding  MIPR  should  go  through  your designated  office.    The  key  is  having  the  requesting  organization  directly  linked  to  the providing agency. If your office receives a MIPR and it is determined that your organization cannot perform or provide the requested goods or services, reject it via a DD 448-2. 1.2.5.  Air Force funds that expire in a given fiscal year must be awarded to a contract or task order within 90 days of acceptance of the MIPR or by 30 September of the given fiscal year, whichever  occurs  first.  If  a  contract  or  task  order  is  not  awarded  by  September  15th,  for funds that expire in the given year, the requiring activity should reevaluate their requirements and deobligate funds as appropriate, to allow use of the funds prior to expiration. For goods, delivery may not  be specified to  occur in  the  year subsequent  to  funds availability unless a lead-time or stock-level exception applies. 1.2.6.  The  requiring  activity  program  manager  (PM)  must  ensure  that  purchases  ordered using  a  DD  Form  448/448-2,  comply  with  all  DoD  acquisition  and  financial  regulations  as well as DFAS and Air Force policies. (T-0). 6 AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 1.2.7.  The requiring activity PM must include DoD-unique clauses and comply with all DoD regulations, directives, and other OMB and public law requirements for all interagency (non-DoD) purchase agreements. (T-0). 1.2.8.  The requiring activity PM must use the Automated Business Services System (ABSS), another automated system that interfaces with ABSS, or Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management  System  (DEAMS)  to  create  the  DD  Form  448.  (T-0).    Once  created,  the  DD Form 448 flows through ABSS or DEAMS for the required policy coordination and reviews implemented in this instruction. 1.2.9.  Funds  certifiers  will  not  certify  nor  will  contracting  officials  perform  reviews  on manually  created  MIPRs.  (T-0).    Manual  preparations  of  MIPRs  are  only  authorized  when the  use  of  ABSS  or  DEAMS  are  unavailable  to  produce  a  compliant  requirement  or disconnected environment 1.2.10.  An Air Force financial analyst must review and certify funds for every MIPR before the  requiring  activity  program  manager  releases  it  to  a  DoD  or  non-DoD  agency  for acceptance. (T-1). 1.2.11.  All  MIPRs leaving the installation will be reviewed by the local  contracting office. (T-1). 1.2.11.1.  For  any  MIPR  that  will  result  in  a  contracting  action,  including  unfunded planning MIPRs, the supporting Air Force contracting office must review the MIPR and the  attached  requirements  package  before  the  requiring  activity  program  or  program manager  releases  it  to  a  DOD  or  non-DoD  agency  for  acceptance.  (T-1).    Specifically, warranted contracting officers are required to review all MIPR packages for compliance on requirements greater than $500,000 that will result in a contracting action (DoD FMR, Volume  11A,  Chapter  18).  Contracting  specialists  are  authorized  to  review  MIPR packages below that threshold. 1.2.11.2.  For  those  MIPRs  that  do  not  result  in  a  new  contracting  action  or  additional contracting actions, review by the contracting office is optional. 1.2.11.3.  Contracting  review  for  Air  National  Guard  MIPRs  will  be  conducted  by  their applicable (Air Force, Army, etc.) contracting office. 1.2.12.  For  MIPRs  that  do  not  leave  the  installation  and  do  not  result  in  a  contract  action (e.g.,  host-tenant  support  reimbursements),  contracting  review  is  not  required.  If  a contracting specialist receives these types of MIPRs they should select the appropriate button in  ABSS  or  DEAMS  to  flow  the  MIPR  to  FMA  (Budget  Office)  for  review  and  funds certification. 1.2.13.  The requiring activity PM is  responsible for managing the MIPR order process,  for managing all goods and services procured by the MIPR or resulting contract, and for tracking funding through all stages of accounting until the order is complete and remaining funds are deobligated. 1.2.14.  The requiring activity PM will not approve advance payments or advance billings for goods or services orders unless explicitly required to do so by an appropriation or other law. (T-0).  The  specific  appropriation  or  law  authorizing  the  advance  must  be  cited  on  the AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 7 obligation  and  interagency  agreement  documents  for  those  few  exceptions  where  advances are authorized. 1.2.15.  The  requiring  activity  PM  with  responsibility  for  the  MIPR  funds  and  mission requirement must date and sign the DD Form 448 hard copy before sending the package to the performing agency. (T-1). 1.2.16.  The  requiring  activity  program  manager,  or  designated  resource  manager  is responsible  for  providing  the  MIPR  package  from  ABSS  or  other  automated  system  to  the performing agency. 1.2.17.  Air Force MIPRs must adhere to the government-wide business rules set forth by the Office  of  Management  and  Budget.  (T-0).  The  specific  business  rule  requirements  are incorporated in the requirements of this instruction at Attachment 5. 1.2.18.  Air Force will not issue or accept a MIPR from North Atlantic Treaty Organization or any foreign country. 1.2.19.  Air  Force  will  not  issue  or  accept  a  MIPR  from  any  organization  unless  that organization receives appropriated funds from the US Congress. 8 AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 Chapter 2 GENERAL GUIDANCE 2.1.  Purchase  Options.  There  are  various  contract  vehicles  utilized  to  purchase  goods  and services.  MIPRs are not the only purchase option. 2.1.1.  Local  Purchases  Using  the  Government  Purchase  Card  (GPC).    Organizational  GPC cardholders  may  purchase  authorized  supplies,  equipment  up  to  the  current  micro-purchase limit,  non-personal  services  up  to  $3,000  and  construction  up  $2,000.    Purchases  up  to $25,000 are also allowed in limited circumstances.  Program managers (PMs) should see the requiring  activity  Agency/Organization  Program  Coordinator  (A/OPC)  for  assistance.  Organizations should look to GPC first as this is our most efficient and economical means for making small purchases. 2.1.2.  Purchase  Using  an  AF  Form  9,  Request  for  Purchase.    The  supporting  Air  Force contracting office can purchase authorized supplies, equipment, and non-personal services at any  dollar  amount.    Always  discuss,  your  procurement  needs  with  contracting  office personnel before beginning the MIPR process.  The contracting office personnel can provide in-person assistance throughout the award and performance of your requirement. 2.1.3.  Intra-Air  Force  Acquisition  Using  a  DD  Form  448,  AF  Form  185,  Project  Order  or AF  Form  9.    Other  Air  Force  organizations  may  be  able  to  provide  available  supplies  and services or can procure supplies and services on a contract.  When intra-Air Force support is available,  Financial  Management  Analysis  (FMA)  or  your  Resource  Advisor/Resource Manager (RA/RM) can provide assistance/guidance on using a DD Form 448, AF Form 185, or  AF  Form  9.    The  preferred  method  for  an  Air  Force  to  Air  Force  purchase request/customer order is the DD Form 448 or AF Form 9. 2.1.4.  MORDs and AF Forms 616. 2.1.4.1.  MORDs.  The requesting entity will no longer send MORDs off the installation to fund direct cite or reimbursable customer orders, nor will the performing organization accept MORDs as a valid customer order. (T-1). 2.1.4.2.  AF  Forms  616.    The  requesting  entity  will  no  longer  use  616s  to  fund reimbursable customer orders nor will the performing organization accept 616s as a valid reimbursable customer order. (T-1). 2.1.4.3.  Acceptance of Reimbursable Customer Orders.  All off installation reimbursable customer  orders  from  an  Air  Force,  Air  National  Guard,  or  Air  Force  Reserve  unit  to another will be made on a DD Form 448 or AF Form 185 and accepted on a DD Form 448-2 or AF Form 185, respectively. (T-1). 2.1.5.  Assisting Agencies.  There are two categories of assisting agencies, intra-agency and interagency. Both are key purchase options using DD Form 448. 2.1.5.1.  Intra-Agency  Acquisition  Using  a  DD  Form  448.  Requirements  are  obtained from  an  agency/organization  outside  of  the  Air  Force  but  within  DoD.    These agencies/organizations  may  be  able  to  provide  military-related  supplies  and  services  or can procure supplies and services on behalf of the Air Force. For example, an Air Force AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 9 unit  sends  a  MIPR  to  the  Army  and  an  order  is  placed  for  supplies/services  for  the  Air Force from an existing contract. The Army is the intra-agency performing agency. 2.1.5.2.  Interagency  (Non-DoD)  Acquisition  using  a  DD  Form  448.    Requirements  are obtained from an agency outside DoD, a Federal  agency.  Interagency acquisitions may be  used  only  when  an  interagency  acquisition  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Air  Force.  Interagency  Acquisition  on  a  DD  448  may  be  accepted  on  a  DD  448-2  or  on  other documented evidence of acceptance. 2.2.  MIPR Categories.  There are two categories of MIPRs, reimbursable and direct cite.  Both categories  can  be  used  on  one  MIPR.    Generally  the  performing  agency  and  the  PM  negotiate whether the order will be reimbursable or direct cite. (T-0). 2.2.1.  Reimbursable  Order  (Category  I):    The  performing  agency  uses  the  additional spending  authority  created  by  the  Unfilled  Customer  Order  (UFCO)  recorded  in  the accounting  system  to  fill  the  order  or  perform  the  service.    The  Defense  Finance  and Accounting Service (DFAS) will process billings to reimburse the assisting/servicing agency using  the  requiring  activity’s  funds  cited  on  the  MIPR.    The  MIPR  number  is  the  source document number throughout the life of the acquisition. 2.2.2.  Direct Cite Order (Category II):  The performing agency directly cites the PM’s fund cite  on  the  resulting  contract,  travel  order,  etc.    DFAS  pays  the  performing  contractors directly from the requiring activity’s fund cite.  The contract number is the source document number throughout the life of the acquisition. 2.3.  MIPR Review.  See Paragraphs 1.2.11., 1.2.12., and 1.2.13. (T-0). 2.4.  MIPR Acceptance.  Once a performing agency receives a MIPR, it must formally accept or reject the order represented by the MIPR.  (T-0).  The performing agencies will accept the order by completing the DD Form 448-2 and returning it to the PM within 30 days.  The performing agency  and  PM  may  use  the  30  day  period  to  correct  any  weaknesses  in  the  MIPR  package before accepting the order. (T-0). 2.4.1.  Air  Force  performing  activity  accepting  a  MIPR  will  complete  the  DD  Form  448-2 using the requesting activities document number  for CAT  I MIPRs, include  the performing organization’s line of accounting (LOA), sign and forward to the local FMA for review. (T-0). 2.4.2.  The local FMA will verify the performing organizations LOA and forward on to their servicing DFAS site to record the unfilled customer order in accounting system. (T-0). 2.5.  Document  Retention.  Organizations  must  comply  with  Air  Force  Manual  33-363, Management of Records, and Disposition Schedule (RDS) regarding the retention of MIPRs and all supporting documentation. (T-1).  Per DoD FMR, Volume 1, Chapter 9, Financial Records Retention, retention is  to  be ten  years  after the  final  invoice or  Intra-Government  Payment  and Collection or other similar documentation. This is an increase over the NARA six year minimum retention standards for these record types. 2.6.  Training.  With the constant flux of personnel, whether civilian or military, training is the key to keeping the accounting business processes current within the organizations.  FMA offices will  provide  training  to  units  supported  by  their  office.  (T-1).  This  would  include  tenant  and medical  units.  Training should include but  not  limited to local  business  process  and document 10 AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 retention requirements.  Keeping abreast of current policies and procedure has become an even bigger issue as Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) continue to drive change in our long standing accounting policies and processes. Trading Partner is Partner Information.  A the 2.7.  Trading customer/requiring/requesting  organization  or  the  providing/performing  organization  of  a support agreement for goods or services. This information is crucial to assist in data mining and intragovernmental elimination processes and is needed when trading occurs with a federal entity, to  include  transactions  through  service  contracts.    At  a  minimum,  trading  partner  information should include (1) Treasury Account Symbol (TAS), (2) Business Partner Number (BPN) and (3) Agency  Location  Code  (ALC).    If  your  trading  partner  does  not  provide  this  necessary  and critical  information,  recommend  elevation  up  the  chain  of  command  which  could  include MAJCOM or SAF/FMFC assistance. either AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 11 Chapter 3 SERVICE CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS 3.1.  Planning  and  Research.  It  is  critical  for  the  PM  to  contact  the  supporting  Air  Force contracting office for advice on management and oversight requirements for service contracts. 3.2.  Performance-Based  Acquisition.  In  accordance  with  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) Part 37, Services Contracting, service acquisitions are performance-based. The PM must ensure  the  Performance  Work  Statement  (PWS)  is  written  in  performance-based  terms  and  is approved by the Services Designated Official (SDO) in accordance with Air Force Management and  Oversight  of  Acquisition  of  Services  Process.  See  your  supporting  Air  Force  contracting office for assistance. (T-0). 3.3.  Services  Designated Official  Approval.  The supporting Air Force contracting office will assist in processing the request for SDO approval.  (T-0).  For interagency acquisitions, the PM will need to obtain one or two approvals from the SDO: 3.3.1.  Approval  to  acquire  services  by  a  contract  or  task  order  awarded  by  a  non-DoD agency. (T-0). 3.3.2.  Approval  to  use  a  non-performance  based  Performance  Work  Statement  (very  rare). (T-0). 3.4.  Quality  Assurance.  MIPRs  for  services  above  $2,500  must  address  quality  assurance requirements  (FAR  46.102,  Quality  Assurance  Policy  and  46.202,  Types  of  Contract  Quality Requirements) to ensure the services rendered meet contract requirements. (T-0).  The PM must develop  a  plan  outlining  how  he/she  is  going  to  assess  contractor  performance  based  on  the particular acquisition. The outline should contain details on what standards the contractor will be held to, as well as detailed plans for oversight and management of the contract. The supporting Air Force contracting office can provide advice for quality assurance planning. 3.5.  Severable  Services.  Severable  services  are  those  that  are  continuing  and  recurring  in nature  and  provide  the  Department  a  benefit  each  time  the  service  is  performed  (e.g., maintenance and repair services, scientific, engineering, and technical services). (T-0). 3.5.1.  Title 10 U.S.C. 2410a permits the performance of severable services to  begin  in  one fiscal year and end in the next provided the period of performance does not exceed one year. Thus the performance of severable services may begin during funds period of availability and may not exceed one year. Therefore, annual appropriations provided to a performing agency that have expired shall be deobligated unless the performance of the services requested began during  the  funds  period  of  availability  and  the  period  of  performance  does  not  exceed  one year. (T-0). 3.5.2.  The  annual  appropriation  from  the  earlier  fiscal  year  may  be  used  to  fund  the  entire cost  of  the  one-year  period  of  performance;  however,  an  annual  appropriation  may  not  be used  to  enter  into  a  severable  services  agreement  where  the  period  of  performance  for services  requested  is  entirely  in  the  following  fiscal  year.  In  no  instance  may  the  period  of performance  extend  beyond  September  30  of  the  subsequent  year  for  services  funded  with annual appropriations. (T-0). 12 AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 3.6.  Non-Severable  Services.  Non-severable services are funded with appropriations available for new obligations at the time the contract is awarded. The period  of performance may extend across fiscal  years. Funds provided to a performing agency that become excess are deobligated when  identified.  Refer  to  Attachment  11,  Example—Initial  Request  for  DD  Form  448-2  for Deobligation of Remaining Funds. (T-0). AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 13 Chapter 4 AUTHORITIES 4.1.  Overview.  The Economy Act authorizes federal agencies to assist each other under certain circumstances,  when  the  performing  agency  does  not  have  a  specific  authority  but  agrees  to accept your order. Assisting agencies are authorized to provide support services either under the Economy  Act  or  under  a  more  specific  statutory  authority.  Some  agencies  outside  of  DoD  are authorized by statute to provide acquisition support or other services to Federal agencies.  This specific authority allows the performing agency to accept your MIPR and to provide the support you  need.    Your  first  choice  for  contract  support  should  always  be  your  supporting  Air  Force contracting office.  Some other agencies charge a fee-for-service.  For example, some agencies fulfill  customer  orders  by  ordering  off  GSA  schedule  contracts.  When  this  happens,  the  Air Force pays a fee-for-service to both the performing agency and GSA. 4.2.  Statutory Authority.  Some agencies have a specific authority to assist other agencies. The PM  must  call  the  performing  agency  to  determine  if  the  agency  has  a  statutory  authority  to accept  the  order.  (T-1).    The  Non-Economy  Act  authorities  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the following. 4.2.1.  Acquisition  Services  Fund.  The  Acquisition  Service  Fund  was  established  by  the General  Service  Administration  Modernization  Act  that  merged  the  General  Supply  Fund and  the  Information  Technology  Fund  to  carry  out  functions  related  to  the  use  of  the Acquisition  Services  Fund  including  any  functions  previously  carried  out  by  the  Federal Supply  Service  and  the  Federal  Technology  Service  managed  by  General  Service Administration. 4.2.2.  Franchise  Fund.  Franchise  Funds  were  first  established  by  P.L.  103-356,  Title  IV, Section  403  to  provide  common  administrative  support  services  on  a  competitive  and  fee basis.  Franchise  fund  programs  originated  within  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency (EPA),  Department  of  Commerce,  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  Department  of Health  and  Human  Services  (HHS),  Department  of  Interior,  and  Department  of  Treasury. The current authority to cite Treasury Franchise Fund is 31 U.S.C. 322, Note. 4.2.3.  Authority of Administrator of General  Services, Services for executive agencies, (40 U.S.C. § 501).  In general the Administrator of General Services shall take action under this subchapter for an executive agency to the extent that the Administrator of General Services determines that the action is advantageous to the Federal Government in terms of economy, efficiency,  or  service;  and  with  due  regard  to  the  program  activities  of  the  agency.    The Secretary  of  Defense  may  exempt  the  Department  of  Defense  from  an  action  taken  by  the Administrator  of  General  Services  under  this  subchapter,  unless  the  President  directs otherwise,  whenever  the  Secretary  determines  that  an  exemption  is  in  the  best  interests  of national security. 4.2.4.

No  agreement  is  necessary  for provision of intragovernmental sales specifically directed or authorized by law. 4.3.2.  Determinations and Findings (D&F) Requirement. Economy Act orders sent to a non-DoD  agency  require  written  approval  in  the  form  of  a  D&F  signed  by  a  Senior  Executive Service (SES) or General Officer (DoD FMR, Volume 11A, Chapter 3, paragraph 030304). A D&F is always required for Economy Act MIPRs going outside of the DoD (FAR 17.502-2, “The Economy Act”). (T-0).  This authority may be delegated, although designees may not be lower than a SES, Flag, or General  Officer. The supporting Air Force contracting office can  advise  the  PM  on  the  proper  staffing  of  the  D&F.    See  Attachment  8,  Example—Economy Act Determinations and Findings for Use with Footnote 9, for a sample Economy Act D&F.

Advance  payments  are  a  transfer  of  funds  to  the  performing agency  from  the  requiring  activity  prior  to  service  being  rendered,  and  must  be  authorized  by specific  statutory  authority  (reference  general  prohibition  of  advance  payments  per  31  U.S.C. Section 3324, and as explained further in DoD FMR Volume 4, Chapter 5).  When authorized, the  performing  agency  can  request  advance  payment  for  services  from  the  requiring  agency.  Advance payments to non-DoD agencies must be approved by the PM prior to acceptance of the MIPR  by  the  performing  agency.  (T-0).    Upon  receipt  of  the  MIPR  acceptance,  Block  13  is reviewed  to  ensure  any  statements  inserted  by  the  assisting  activity  are  accurate  to  include verifying any advance payment/billing information and money amount is authorized. 6.1.1.  Advance  Payment  Approved.   The  requiring  activity  will  submit  required documentation  to  DFAS  for  an  advance  payment.  (T-1).    For  legacy  process  the  advance payment is recorded in the accounting system as a negative Undelivered Order Outstanding (UOO) and a positive Accrued Expenditure Paid (AEP) transaction under a type vendor “2” Program  Summary  Record/Funds  Summary  Record  (PSR/FSR)  and  a  Budget  Program Activity  Code  (BPAC)  of  "9910"  or  "9940".    Specific  processing  and  coding  requirements are  provided  in  DFAS-DE  7077.2-M,  USAF  Standard  Base-Level  General  Accounting  and Finance System: H069/BQ Software User Manual, Section 19, paragraphs 19.20 and 19.21. (T-0). 6.1.2.  Accounting for the Advance Payment.  For legacy Processing, as performance occurs, receiving reports and invoices must be forwarded to the applicable DFAS operating location for processing to draw down the advance amount from the type vendor “2” Detail Summary Record  (DSR)/PSR  and  charge  the  type  vendor  “4”  or  "5"  DSR/PSR  in  the  accounting system. (T-0).  When the action procured by the MIPR is complete and/or the entire advance has been settled by performance, there should be no remaining UOO and AEP balances in the type vendor  "2" DSR/PSR.   Note:  Upon  contract  award or obligation of  the MIPR  action, the entire amount of the obligation must be established in the accounting system as a positive UOO balance under a type vendor “4” or "5" PSR/FSR, as applicable. 6.2.  Partial Advance of MIPR.  If a partial advance payment/billing is authorized, the requiring activity  will  forward  a  copy  of  the  DD  Form  448-2  to  the  DFAS  operating  location  for processing. (T-0). 6.2.1.  Accounting  for  the  Partial  Advance  Payment.    For  Legacy  processing  the  DFAS operating  location  will  process  the  DD  Form  448-2  advance  as  a  negative  UOO  and  a positive AEP transaction using a type vendor “2” PSR/FSR and BPAC of "9910" or "9940". The  UOO  balance  set  up  for  the  contract  award  or  obligation  of  the  MIPR  action  is  not adjusted based on the advance payment.  The entire amount of this obligation is reflected in the accounting system as a positive UOO balance under a type vendor “4” or "5" PSR/FSR, as applicable.  These transactions show up as separate line items on the Open Document List; the  advance  under  a  type  vendor  “2”  DSR/PSR and  a  BPAC  of  "9910"  or  "9940",  and  the contract  award  or  obligation  of  the  MIPR  under  a  type  vendor  “4"  or  "5"  DSR/PSR,  as applicable, without the BPAC of "9910" or "9940". AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 23 6.2.2.  Actions  during  Contract  Performance.    Trading  Partners  will  establish  a  process  on validating performance and invoice accuracy.  As performance occurs, the requiring activity forwards  receiving  reports  and  invoices  to  the  applicable  DFAS  operating  location  for processing to draw down the advance amount from the type vendor “2” DSR/PSR and charge the type vendor “4” or "5" DSR/PSR in the accounting system. 6.2.3.  Entire Advance is settled.  When the partial advance has been settled by performance, there should be no remaining UOO and AEP balances in the type vendor "2" DSR/PSR, and the  AEP  balance  should  now  be  reflected  in  the  type  vendor  “4”  or  "5"  DSR/PSR.  The remaining  unexpended  UOO  balance  in  the  type  vendor  “4”  or  "5"  DSR/PSR  is  to  support the additional payment(s) required to complete the MIPR action.  DFAS operating locations process the payment(s) against the “4” or "5" DSR/PSR through the final invoice. 6.2.4.  Final Invoice.  Once payment for the final invoice has been processed against the type vendor “4” or "5" DSR/PSR, any remaining balance on the MIPR must be deobligated from the type vendor “4” or "5" DSR/PSR upon receipt of an amended DD Form 448-2 from the performing agency. When the action procured by the MIPR is complete, and any remaining balance on the MIPR deobligated, there should be no remaining UOO and AEP balances in the type vendor "2" DSR/PSR and only an AEP balance in the "4" or "5" PSR/FSR. 6.3.  Full  Advance  of  MIPR.  If  a  full  advance  payment/billing  is  authorized,  the  requiring activity  will  forward  a  copy  of  the  DD  Form  448-2  to  the  DFAS  operating  location  for processing. (T-0).  The DFAS operating location will process the DD Form 448-2 advance as a negative UOO and a positive AEP transaction using a type vendor “2” PSR/FSR and BPAC of "9910"  or  "9940".  The  UOO  balance  set  up  for  the  contract  award  or  obligation  of  the  MIPR action  is  not  adjusted  based  on  the  advance  payment.    The  entire  amount  of  this  obligation  is reflected  in  the  accounting  system  as  a  positive  UOO  balance  under  a  type  vendor  “4”  or  "5" PSR/FSR,  as  applicable.  These  transactions  show  up  as  separate  line  items  on  the  Open Document  List;  the  advance  under  a  type  vendor  “2”  DSR/PSR  and  a  BPAC  of  "9910"  or "9940",  and  the  contract  award  or  obligation  of  the  MIPR  under  a  type  vendor  “4"  or  "5" DSR/PSR, as applicable, without the BPAC of "9910" or "9940". 6.3.1.  Actions  during  Contract  Performance.    As  performance  occurs  through  the  final invoice,  the  requiring  activity  forwards  receiving  reports  and  invoices  to  the  applicable DFAS  operating  location  for  processing  to  draw  down  the  advance  amount  from  the  type vendor  “2”  DSR/PSR  and  charge  the  type  vendor  “4”  or  "5"  DSR/PSR  in  the  accounting system. 6.3.2.  Final  Invoice.  Once the final  invoice has been processed, any remaining balance on the  advance  must  be  collected  back  from  the  performing  agency  and  then  any  remaining balance on the MIPR must be deobligated from the type vendor “4” or "5" DSR/PSR upon receipt  of  an  amended  DD  Form  448-2  from  the  performing  agency.  When  the  action procured  by  the  MIPR  is  complete,  and  any  excess  advance  collected  back  from  the performing agency and any remaining balance on the MIPR deobligated, there should be no remaining  UOO  and  AEP  balances  in  the  type  vendor  "2"  DSR/PSR  and  only  an  AEP balance in the "4" or "5" PSR/FSR. 6.4.  Recording of Contract Award for Direct Cite MIPR.  The FMA office sends the contract award  document  for  Category  II  direct  cite  MIPRs,  to  the  applicable  DFAS  operating  location 24 AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 for  processing  the  obligation  in  the  requiring  activity's  accounting  records.  The  funds  are obligated in the accounting system using the document ID of the contract award document. 6.5.  Recording  of  Obligation  for  Reimbursable  MIPRs.  The  funds  are  obligated  in  the accounting system using DD Form 448-2, MIPR Acceptance. The document ID must utilize the Standard  Document  Number  (SDN)  format  for  reimbursable  MIPRs.    For  Legacy  the  entire amount is established in the accounting system as a positive UOO balance under a type vendor “4” PSR/FSR, as applicable, without the BPAC of "9910" or "9940". 6.6.  Monthly Validation Process.  The PM or RA/RM must validate all outstanding MIPRs on a monthly basis to ensure timely processing of invoices and timely deobligation of excess funds. (T-0).    Where  available,  this  validation  should  be  annotated  in  the  applicable  system  via  note areas or attachments.   The PM or RA/RM should run a query at the end of each month using the Commander’s Resource Information System (CRIS) and/or DEAMS.  (Contact your base FMA on procedures to acquire access to CRIS and/or DEAMS).  The CRIS and/or DEAMS query for an ODL should include at a minimum the following “data elements” and “account balances” to ensure all outstanding MIPRs are retrieved: 6.6.1.  For  advances:  Type  Vendor  Code  “2”,  Commitment  Balance  “COM”,  Undelivered Orders  Outstanding  “UOO”  (obligation),  Accrued  Expenditure  Unpaid  “AEU”,  Accrued Expenditure Paid “AEP”. 6.6.2.  For Category  I MIPRs. Utilize the SDN  which should contain a  “G” in  position 11. Commitment  Balance  “COM”,  Undelivered  Orders  Outstanding  “UOO”  (obligation), Accrued Expenditure Unpaid “AEU”, Accrued Expenditure Paid “AEP”. 6.6.3.  For  Category  II  MIPRs  (recorded  under  the  contract  number):  Type  Vendor  Code “4”ictector  "5",  Commitment  Balance  “COM”,  Undelivered  Orders  Outstanding  “UOO” (obligation),  Accrued  Expenditure  Unpaid  “AEU”,  Accrued  Expenditure  Paid  “AEP”,  but consult  assisting  DFAS  operating  location  for  criteria  to  narrow  scope  of  CRIS  query,  if required. 6.6.4.  Monthly Validation.  When performing the monthly outstanding MIPR validation, it is important  for  the  PM  or  RA/RM  to  work  with  their  base  FMA  office  to  confirm  their balances and work any discrepancies with the DFAS operating location.  Also work with the performing  agency  to  correct  any  billing  discrepancies  or  adjustments  that  require  an amended DD Form 448-2. This ensures invoices are processed in a timely manner and also allow for the timely obligation/deobligation of funds.   Note:    Data elements  “Type  Vendor Code”  (2)  should  only  be  used  in  the  CRIS  query  when  an  advance  payment  has  been authorized for the MIPR. 6.7.  Stages of Accounting for Requesting Activity. 6.7.1.  Commitment Balance (COM) - Initial reservation of funds prior to MIPR acceptance. 6.7.2.  Undelivered Orders Outstanding  (UOO)  –  Funds are obligated via MIPR acceptance or awarded contract. 6.7.3.

A non-severable service is one that goes toward a defined end result. For example, a contract to re-carpet or paint an office is non-severable—the  customer  needs  the  whole  thing  done,  i.e.,  the  end  result  of  the  service.  Also, performance of a research study with a final report would be a non-severable service. Non-severable  Work  and  Services—Must be delivered whole or to  completion to  realize any benefit and fulfill the requirement. A simple example would be a contract for the construction of a bridge across a river that would start on January 1, 2013 and complete on December 31, 2013. If  the  contract  was  terminated,  prior  to  completion,  (June  30,  20013),  no  benefit  would  be realized because only half a bridge would exist and it would not fulfill the original requirement to move traffic from one side of the river to the other. In general, services tend to be severable while the construction and/or delivery of goods tend to be non-severable. Obligation—(related to MIPRs)—A legal liability to pay for the cost of goods and services to be delivered under a purchase order or contract.  The DD Form 448-2 or other documented evidence of acceptance is the obligating document for Category I, Reimbursable MIPRs and the contract award document is the obligating document for Category II, Direct Cite MIPRs. Open  Document  Listing  (ODL)—A  computerized  list  of  open  commitments  (COM), obligations  (UOO),  and  accrued  expenditures  unpaid  (AEU)  extracted  from  the  General Accounting and Finance System.  The RA/RM can request a list at any time. The list enables the PM to monitor and manage open commitments and obligations. The ODL is a useful tool to help you successfully manage your funds. Performance-Based  Services  Acquisition  (PBSA)—An  acquisition  for  services  that  is structured around the results to be achieved as opposed to the manner by which the work is to be performed.  A  PBSA  must  state  measurable  performance  standards  (i.e.,  in  terms  of  quality, timeliness,  quantity,  etc.)  and  state  the  method  of  assessing  contractor  performance  against performance standards and may have performance incentives where appropriate. Performing  Agency/Activity—Agency  or  activity  authorized  to  award  contracts  or  orders  for DoD  federal  agencies/activities.  Also  referred  to  as  a  assisting,  supporting,  or  supplying agency/activity.    Examples  are  GSA,  GovWorks,  FedSource,  Veteran’s  Administration,  and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Period  of  Availability—The  period  the  funds  are  available  for  commitment,  obligation,  and execution before they expire and are unusable. Also see Bona Fide Need Rule. Performance  Work  Statement  (PWS)—Describes  the  required  performance  results  in  clear, specific  and  objective  terms  with  measurable  outcomes  for  a  performance-based  services acquisition (PBSA). Project Order—An order issued under the authority contained in 41 U.S.C. 6307. Project orders are issued by and accepted for performance in a DoD owned and operated establishment. When placed  with,  and  accepted  by  a  DoD  establishment,  the  project  order  serves  to  obligate 34 AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 appropriations  in  the  same  manner  as  orders  or  contracts  placed  with  commercial  enterprises. The activity receiving a project order must be capable of manufacturing the goods or supplying the  services  requested  on  the  order  and  not  simply  a  conduit  or  middleman  for  funds  used  to procure the goods or services. Reimbursement—Funding  received  by  a  performing  agency  for  the  cost  of  goods  or  services furnished  to  others,  for  credit  to  the  performing  agency’s  own  appropriation  or  other  fund account. Reimbursable  Order—The  performing  agency  finances  an  Air  Force  purchase  of  goods  and services and bills the Air Force for reimbursement. Also known as a Category I MIPRs. Requiring  Activity—The  unit/activity  requiring  goods  or  services,  provides  funding  to  fulfill the  requirement,  and  requests  assistance  from  a  performing  agency.  Also  referred  to  as  the requiring, receiving, or requesting agency/activity. Sales  Code  (SC)—A  3-character  alphanumeric  field  to  identify  sources  for  appropriation reimbursement. Services  Designated  Official  (SDO)—The  individual  authorized  IAW  the  FY02  National Defense  Authorization  Act  (NDAA),  Section  2330(a)(2)(A)  to  exercise  responsibility  for  the management and oversight of the acquisition of services. These responsibilities include ensuring services  acquisitions  are  performance-based;  approving,  in  advance,  any  acquisition  that  is  not performance-based;  and  approving  the  acquisition  of  services  procured  through  the  use  of  a contract or task order being awarded by an agency other than DoD. Severable—A deliverable item that has an end product or undertaking that if ended suddenly the government has received the full value of the service up to the time it ended. For example, 24-hour computer help desk support is severable because complete service is received at the end of each day. Severable work and services can be stopped prior to  the originally planned term  and the  requiring  activity  still  received  benefit.  A  simple  example  would  be  a  contract  for  weekly garbage removal from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013. If the contract was terminated in mid-term, (June 30, 2013), the benefit of having the garbage removed from January to June 2013 would still be realized. Statement  of  Work  (SOW)—A detailed description of the services a contractor is  required to perform,  written  by  the  PM  or  designee,  that  describes  the  desired  results,  performance measures,  and  other  instructions  as  necessary.  The  SOW  establishes  the  bona-fide  need  of  the government. For assistance in drafting a SOW, see the assisting contracting office. Studies,  analyses  and  evaluations—contracted  services  that  provide  organized,  analytical assessments/evaluations  in  support  of  policy  development,  decision-making,  management,  or administration. Included are studies in support of R&D activities. Also included are acquisitions of models, methodologies, and related software supporting studies, analyses or evaluations. Support  Agreement—A  written  agreement  that  establishes  the  roles  and  responsibilities  for recurring support between the requiring activity and the performing agency. Support agreements may  be  intra-agency  (between  DoD  federal  agencies)  or  interagency  (between  DoD  and  non-DoD federal agencies). Also may be referred to as a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).   AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 35 Task Order—A task order is an order for services placed against an established contract. Type  Vendor—A  1-position  numeric  code  that  identifies  obligations,  refunds,  and  advances received/paid. Type vendor codes 1 through 6 identify obligations by vendor class, type vendors 8 and 9, identify refunds receivable as being due from the Federal Government or the public.  36 AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 Attachment 2 PROCESS FLOWCHART FOR REQUESTING ACTIVITY  AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 37  Table A2.1.  Flowchart Explanations. Step  Title 1 PM Identifies validated  Requirement (Market Research) 2 3 Obtain RA/RM or FMA Business Advice PM Obtains Contracting Business Advice Description Identify needed support, supplies, or services to be purchased and conduct market research to determine potential sources.  Contact the supporting Air Force contracting office for assistance.  Document your market research. The PM should contact the RA/RM or FMA who will confirm funding availability and if funding is appropriate for the acquisition (purpose, time, and amount). Contracting business advice is essential.  When the requirement is identified, the PM should contact the supporting Air Force contracting office to discuss the 38 AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 requirement.  Contracting can advise whether the desired goods or services can be best purchased by the contracting office or by another agency using a MIPR.   The contracting office will recommend a sourcing strategy that considers such factors as satisfying customer requirements, cost effectiveness and price, delivery schedule, availability of a suitable existing contract (within or outside DoD), contract administration, small business opportunities, compliance with DoD acquisition regulations and acquisition lead time.  If a MIPR is determined to be the appropriate purchase request vehicle, the contracting office will help to confirm with a contracting officer from the performing agency that the supplies or services to be provided are within scope of the performing agency contract and any unique Air Force or DoD contract terms and conditions are incorporated into the resultant order to comply with applicable statutes, regulations and directives (e.g., requirement of DFAR 225.7002-1, Authorization Acts, Appropriations Acts, and Other Statutory Restrictions on Foreign Acquisition – Restrictions, that certain items procured with DoD funds be of domestic origin).  In addition, the contracting office will advise the requiring activity of other required supporting documentation, such as certification of proper use of non-DoD contracts.  See Attachment 2, DD Form 448 and Requirements Package Review Checklist.  Contact the performing agency to determine if the order is authorized by a specific statutory authority or if it must be approved under the Economy Act Authority.  When a specific statutory authority applies, the performing agency must cite the applicable statute on the DD Form 448-2 or other documented evidence of acceptance.  See Paragraph B of Attachment 5. Cite Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) on DD Form 448 using footnote 8 or 9 of Attachment 3.  Refer to Chapter 5, Paragraph 5.1.2 regarding the additional requirements for Economy Act orders. ABSS and DEAMS are an automated system for creating and routing financial documents through required reviews and approvals and then provides financial document information to accounting and procurement systems.  Users may create MIPRs in either ABSS, other automated system that interfaces with ABSS, or DEAMS.  FMA will provide ABSS and DEAMS training to new users.  FMA will also establish the proper document flow for your organization.  Anyone with the need to create MIPRs can 4 Determine Applicable Authority 4A Specific Authority 4B Economy Act 5 Generate DD Form 448 in ABSS, Other Automated System that Interfaces with ABSS, or DEAMS AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 39 6 Add Attachments to DD Form 448 in ABSS or DEAMS as applicable use either ABSS or DEAMS after completing training.  Regardless of who creates the MIPR, the PM retains responsibility for procuring the requirement and tracking the funds spent. . (Note: for separation of duties the MIPR initiator, MIPR approver and fund certifier will be three separate people) Once the MIPR has been created and approved in the requiring activity, the ABSS or DEAMS flow will send the MIPR and attachments to the supporting Air Force contracting office.  See Attachments 3 for required footnotes and Attachment 5 for the required interagency agreement. Required attachments:   Performance Work Statement (PWS) or description of goods required   Independent Government Estimate   Market Research   Appointment of Contracting Officer Representative (COR) who will oversee contract performance   DoD Unique Terms and Conditions (includes Berry Amendment, Buy American Act, electronic payment, etc.)   Interagency Agreement (See Attachment 5) The following documents may be needed as attachments to the MIPR:   Use of Non-DoD contract D&F (see Attachment 6)   Economy Act D&F (see Attachment 7)   SDO Approval   Justification and Approvals for sole source (see FAR 6.303)    Justification for Brand Name (see FAR 11.105) 7 Route to Contracting for Coordination The supporting AF contracting office will determine if the action results in a contract action.  Air Force contracting official must review the MIPR and the attached requirements package before the requiring activity program or program manager releases it to a DoD or non-DoD agency for acceptance.  Warranted contracting officers are required to review all MIPR packages for compliance on requirements greater than $500,000 (DoD FMR, Volume 11A, Chapter 18).  The contracting official may offer advice to improve or complete the MIPR package.  The contracting official does not approve/disapprove the package.  The contracting officer will not forward the MIPR package if not all documents are attached.  Rather, the PM retains the responsibility for completeness and compliance.  See Attachment 2 for a review checklist.  For MIPRs that do not result in a contracting action, a contracting office will flow the 40 AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 8 Route to FMA for Review and Funds Certification  9 10 11 12 13 PM or designated personnel Fax or E-mail DD Form 448 to Performing Agency Performing Agency Requests Advance Payment or Advance Billing (When Applicable) PM Receives  MIPR Acceptance DD FORM 448-2 or other documented evidence of acceptance PM or RA/RM Delivers DD Form 448-2 or other documented evidence of acceptance or Contract to FMA PM Participates in Technical Evaluation of Offers (optional) 14 PM Receives Contract MIPR through ABSS or DEAMS to the next reviewing office. Once a contracting office has completed their action for the MIPR, the document is forwarded in ABSS or DEAMS to the FMA.  A financial advisor in the FMA will review the document to ensure it meets all financial rules (purpose, time, and amount).  If requirements are met and funds are available, FMA will certify the MIPR to record the commitment in the accounting system.  After the MIPR is certified, the PM enters ABSS or DEAMS and prints a copy of the DD Form 448 and attachments.  The PM signs the DD Form 448 in Block 9b, Footnote 1, and sends the entire package to the performing agency’s point of contact. Non-DoD federal agency sends a memorandum requesting advance payment or advance billing to the PM.  The memorandum must include the specific appropriation or law authorizing the advance payment/advance billing.  The PM approves/disapproves the request for advance payment/advance billing and returns the memorandum indicating approval/disapproval. If approved, the performing agency puts the following information in Block 13 of the DD Form 448-2, or on other documented evidence of acceptance “advance payment or advance billing is approved, specific amount, name of PM approving the advance, and the specific appropriation or law authorizing the advance payment or advance billing”. Once the performing agency agrees to accept the terms and conditions on the MIPR, they will prepare a DD Form 448-2 and send it to the PM.  In addition to the DD Form 448-2, Direct Cite MIPRs (Category II) require a copy of a contract award.  PMs must follow-up on DD Form 448-2 if not received within 30 days. For reimbursable (Category I) MIPRs, the PM or RA/RM must provide a copy of the DD Form 448-2, MIPR acceptance, to FMA.  FMA forwards to DFAS for input of obligation.  Retain direct cite (Category II) DD Form 448-2 with MIPR files. For complex acquisitions such as services or studies, the PM should work together with the performing agency contracting officer to review all offers received.  The PM should help determine which offer provides the best value based on the evaluation criteria. PM receives the contract award document and delivers it to FMA for direct cite (Category II) MIPRs.  If a Direct Cite MIPR, use the contract number for all future AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 41 accounting transactions in lieu of the MIPR number.  FMA forwards a copy of the awarded contract (Category II MIPR) to DFAS for input of obligation.  Follow-up on contract award if not received within 90 days of receipt of the DD Form 448-2 or other documented evidence of acceptance. The RA/RM and PM must take actions, in coordination and assistance of DFAS, to correct improperly recorded accounting transactions, i.e., changing an expensed transaction to an advance, ensuring proper aging and liquidation, and return of funds for erroneously disbursed payments.  For direct cite MIPRs ensure the contract number rather than the MIPR number is recorded in the accounting system.  See Chapter 6. The PM is responsible for follow-up/reconciliation of MIPRs until all supplies and/or services are received and bills/invoices are posted in the accounting system.  Reviews may also be done via local requirements or in accordance with the AF Triannual review program.  15 RA/RM And PM Validates Transactions Posted to Accounting System PM and RA/RM Provide Receiving Reports as Required per Contract Throughout Life of MIPR.  Follow-up on MIPR Until Closed 16  42 AFI65-118  4 OCTOBER 2016 Attachment 3 CHECKLIST FOR DD FORM 448 AND REQUIREMENTS PACKAGE REVIEW A3.1.
