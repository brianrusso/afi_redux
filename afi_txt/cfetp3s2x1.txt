This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education  and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements,  training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty. The  CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all  aspects of career field training.  NOTE: Civilians and additional duty training managers  occupying associated positions may use Part II to support duty position qualification  training.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts.  Supervisors plan, manage, and control training  within the specialty using both parts of the plan.  2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan.  Section B identifies career field  progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field  path. Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other). Section D indicates resource constraints (i.e.  funds, manpower, equipment, facilities). Section E identifies transition training plans for  the 3S2X1 career field.  2.2.  Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, and technical references to support training, Air  Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, core task and  correspondence course requirements.  Section B. This area is reserved.  Section C  identifies available support materials. Section D identifies a training course index  supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here  are both mandatory and optional courses. Section E identifies Major Command  (MAJCOM) unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional  training required for the associated qualification needs.  At unit level, supervisors and  trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the  overall goals of this plan.  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career.  This plan  will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.    1 ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) – ADL is an evolution of distributive learning (distance learning) that emphasizes collaboration on standards-based versions of reusable  objects, networks, and learning management systems, yet may include some legacy  methods and media.

(3) FTTs are teams of FTD instructors who conduct training at operational bases without an AETC presence using that base’s facilities. Mobile training sets may be used to support training and usually consist of trainers, training aids, and select operational equipment.  Type 5, Training by Other U. S. Government Agencies (Excludes Interservice Training Review Organizations [ITRO]) – Formal training conducted by the Army, Navy, an Air Force agency or unit other than AETC, or other government agencies/organizations inside or outside of the Department of Defense (DoD). Type 5 training does not include ITRO consolidated or collocated training (see AFI 36-2230(I), Interservice Training) or DoD executive agent courses (see DoDD 5101.1, DoD Executive Agent).  Type 6, DL – Formal training designed for export to students at bases of assignment and for students to complete without AETC course-qualified instructor on-site expertise.   Type 7, Mobile Training Team (MTT) – AETC instructors from organizations that typically provide Types 2, 3 and 7 training, who conduct training at an operational base using that base’s facilities. Mobile training sets may be used to support training and usually consist of trainers, training aids, and select operational equipment.   Type 8, ITRO – A consolidated formal training course with the Air Force as lead service. Course faculty includes fair share instructor representation from participating services and the host service. Usually, a mixture of service personnel teach the course.  Type 9, ITRO – A consolidated formal training course with another service as lead. Course faculty includes fair share instructor representation from participating services and the host service. Usually, a mixture of service personnel teach the course.  Upgrade Training (UGT) – Mandatory training which leads to attainment of a higher  level of proficiency.  Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) – A forum of the AFCFM, FMs, SMEs  and AETC training personnel to determines career ladder training requirements.  Wartime Course – Comprised of those tasks that must be taught when courses are accelerated in a wartime environment.  Wartime Tasks – Tasks to be taught in the 3-skill level awarding course when the wartime courses have  been activated. In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will  be taught in the 3-skill level awarding course in a streamlined training environment. These tasks are only for those career fields that require them to be applied to their  technical training center tasks.   6 Section A - General Information  1.  Purpose.  This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM  FMs, commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage,  and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines  the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies  initial skills, upgrade, qualification,  advanced and proficiency training.  IST is the AFS specific training an individual receives  upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-  skill level. Normally, this  training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training  centers. Upgrade training  identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-,5-, 7-, 9-skill level. QT is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify  an airman in a  specific duty position.  This training occurs both during and after the  upgrade  training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge  required to do the job.  AT is formal specialty training used for selected airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced  training courses, or OJT provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge  beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes--some are:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program. It is also used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate  point in an individual’s career.  1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.  1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and  the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Usage.  The plan will be used by MAJCOM FMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in  the specialty.  2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field  and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and  documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop  acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide identified training.  2.2.  MAJCOM FMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP  mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training,  contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOM-  developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into this  CFETP.  2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this CFETP.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 7 3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  The  AFCFM  will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on  the career field training requirements.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will  eliminate duplicate training.  Section B - Career Progression and Information  4.  Specialty Description.  4.1.  Specialty Summary.
