Background.  The  procedures  in  this  instruction  are  essential  to  develop,  implement  and maintain  a  compatible  land  use  program  in  compliance  with  all  federal,  state,  and  local requirements. 1.1.1.  The  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  Federal  Management  Circular  (FMC)  75-2 Compatible  Land  Uses  at  Federal  Airfields  requires  federal  agencies  operating  airfields  to work with local,  regional, state and other federal officials on compatible land use planning.  It requires other federal agencies to ensure their programs foster compatible use according to plans (such as AICUZ) developed by the federal agency operating the airfield. 1.1.2.  DoDI 4165.57, May 2, 2011, with change 1, 12 March 2015, and requires the military departments  to  develop,  implement,  and  maintain  an  AICUZ  program  for  each  installation, and  requires  military  departments  to  develop  and  update,  as  necessary,  AICUZ  studies  that contain an analysis of land use compatibility problems and potential solutions.  The DODI: 1.1.2.1.  Establishes  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  policy  for  achieving  compatible  use of  lands  in  the  vicinity  of  military  airfields  to  protect  public  health,  safety  and  welfare without degrading flight safety and mission requirements including: 1.1.2.1.1.  Promoting long-term compatible land use in the vicinity of air installations through  State  and  local  government  adoption  of  compatible  land  use  regulations  in local  land  use  planning  and  control  processes  or,  when  necessary,  acquisition  of development  rights  or  conservation  easements  using  existing  acquisition  authorities or through partnering with communities or other eligible entities. 1.1.2.1.2.  Limiting  acquisition  of  real  property  interests  to  the  minimum  necessary and 1.1.2.1.3.  Promoting  education  and  engagement  with  communities  affected  by military operations. 1.1.2.2.  Defines  the  procedures  DoD  Components  shall  take  to  address  land  use compatibility where: 1.1.2.2.1.  Aircraft operations may affect public health, safety, and/or welfare 1.1.2.2.2.  Certain  uses  or  structures  may  obstruct  the  airspace,  attract  birds,  create electromagnetic  or  thermal  interference,  or  produce  dust,  smoke,  steam,  or  light emissions  that  could  impact  a  pilot’s  vision,  or  otherwise  be  hazardous  to  or incompatible with aircraft operations. 1.1.2.3.  Defines areas of higher risk from aircraft accidents and high noise exposure and provides recommended land uses 1.2.  Concept. 1.2.1.  The  concept  of  compatible  use  applies  to  both  land  and  water  bodies  within  the installation complex and is evaluated from two perspectives. The first is evaluating how AF activities could affect the use proposed for the land or water areas, and the second is whether   6  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 the  use  of  land  or  water  areas  could  either  directly  or  indirectly  affect  Air  Force  activities.  The  program  emphasizes  the  development  of  long-term  solutions  to  achieve  compatibility rather than achieving it on a case by case basis.  This instruction and the associated handbook (AFH  32-7063,  AICUZ  Program  Managers  Guide)  provide  a  foundation  for  engaging  with the local land use planning processes and evaluating compatible land uses. 1.2.2.  This instruction is not intended to duplicate federal, state, or local requirements, but is intended  to  provide  MAJCOMs  and  installations  guidance  for  achieving  compatible development in accordance with AFPD 90-20. 1.2.3.  MAJCOMs  may  provide  additional  implementing  guidance  in  their  supplemental publication(s) to this instruction. 1.2.4.  The AICUZ program objectives are to: 1.2.4.1.  Assist  local,  regional,  state and federal  officials  in  protecting the  public health, safety, and welfare by promoting long-term land use compatible with military operations. 1.2.4.2.  Protect  AF  operational  capability from the effects  of land and water use which are incompatible with AF operations. 1.2.5.  Key  elements  of  this  program  include  proactive  engagement  and  establishing  strong long-lasting  relationships  with  local  communities  and  governments  and  other  agencies  to foster  a  better  understanding  of  installation  operations  and  procedures,  and  of  local community needs and concerns. 1.3.  Applicability of AICUZ program to Joint Use Airfields. 1.3.1.  Civilian Flight Operations at Military Airfields.  AICUZ program requirements apply to  Air  Force-owned  runways,  taxiways,  and  other  necessary  facilities  where  non-military aircraft operations are conducted.  The AICUZ program manager will include both military and  non-military  operations  in  the  AICUZ  study  (T-1).    At  locations  where  the  Air  Force owns a runway(s) and a civil authority either owns, or has leased a runway(s) from the Air Force,  the  Air  Force  will  prepare  an  AICUZ  study  that  includes  both  civilian  and  military aircraft operations. 1.3.2.  Military Flight Operations at Civil Airfields.  At Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve  installations  located  on  civilian  airfields  that  do  not  participate  in  the  FAA’s  Part 150 program, the Base Civil Engineer will provide data on military aircraft operations to the airfield operator with a request that they prepare an AICUZ study or equivalent (T-2).  If the airfield operator does not agree, the installation turns over all AICUZ related materials to the airfield operator and refers all land use compatibility matters to the airfield operator. 1.3.2.1.  At  Air  National  Guard  or  Air  Force  Reserve  installations  located  on  civilian airfields that do participate in the FAA’s Part 150 program, the Base Civil Engineer will provide the airport authority the necessary operational data to allow the airport to update their Noise Exposure Map as needed (T-2). 1.3.2.2.  When  an  active  duty  Air  Force  base  conducts  a  significant  number  of  flight operations at a civil airport, but does not base the aircraft at that location, such as a site serving  as  an  auxiliary  airfield,  the  host  base  of  the  flying  units  using  the  airport  will prepare  an  AICUZ  study  and  provide  it  to  the  airfield  operator  for  release  (T-2).    The AICUZ program manager at the installation that is using the civilian airfield should assist AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   7  the  airport  authority  on  all  land  use  compatibility  issues  that  may  impact  military operations at that airfield. 1.4.  Relationship  of  the  AICUZ  program  and  the  Air  Force  Encroachment  Management (AFEM)  Program.  The  AICUZ  program  is  one  of  the  foundation  programs  that  the  AFEM program builds upon.  The AICUZ program focuses on compatible development issues near the airfield  and  provides  land  use  recommendations  for  communities  to  incorporate  into  their planning  regulations  in  order  to  prevent  encroachment.    Building  on  programs  such  as  AICUZ and other existing AF programs, the AFEM program framework allows the integration of issues spanning thirteen encroachment and sustainment challenges (including compatible development) into  an  integrated  action  plan  for  the  installation  to  implement.    The  AFEM  program  does  not replace the AICUZ program.   8  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

General.  The  majority  of  the  compatibility  zones  are  for  air  installations,  however,  Air Force  supported  Joint  Bases  with  an  Army  component  with  ground  training  activities  have additional  compatibility  zones  centered  on  ground  training  noise.    This  chapter  describes  the technical  criteria used to  define both  the physical extent of the zones as well as any  associated land use compatibility guidelines.  The compatibility zones at an air installation consist of: 3.1.1.  Land  areas  within  Clear  Zone  and  Accident  Potential  Zones  (APZs)  of  an  AF  base with active runways. 3.1.2.  Land areas exposed to high levels of noise from aircraft operations, defined as being within the A-weighted Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL) 65 dB (or Community Noise Equivalent  Level  (CNEL)  60  dB  in  California)  and  higher,  noise  zones.    At  Air  Force  led Joint  Bases  with  an  Army  component  there  may  be  additional  major  noise  sources  such  as small arms ranges and artillery/explosives training.  The noise zones for small arms noise are defined  as  the  area  within  87  dB  Peak  and  higher.   The  noise  zones  and  for artillery/explosives  training  noise  are  the  areas  within  the  62  dB  CDNL  (or  C  weighted CNEL in California) and higher. 3.1.3.  Land areas surrounding the airfield on which certain uses may obstruct the airspace or pose hazards to flight safety. 3.1.4.  Line of sight/radar look angles, if appropriate. 3.2.  Fixed Wing Clear Zones and Accident Potential Zones.  Clear Zones and APZs are areas off the end of DOD runways that were developed based on past Air Force aircraft accidents and reflect land areas at greater risk of an aircraft accident.  The Clear Zone and the APZs represent areas  where  an  accident  is  most  likely  to  occur,  if  one  would  occur,  however  they  are  not predictors of accidents. 3.2.1.  The  Clear  Zone  begins  at  the  end  of  the  runway  and  is  the  area  of  highest  accident potential; it has few uses that are compatible. APZ I lies beyond the Clear Zone is in area of lower  but  still  considerable  accident  potential.  APZ  II  is  beyond  APZ  I  and  possesses  less accident  potential  than  APZ  I  but  still  high  enough  to  warrant  land  use  restriction recommendations. 3.2.2.  DoD Instruction 4165.57 is the basis for runway Clear Zones and APZs for fixed-wing aircraft.    Chapter  7  of  Unified  Facilities  Criteria  (UFC)  3-260-01,  Airfield  and  Heliport Planning and Design defines the dimensions for Clear Zones and APZs for C-130 and C-17 landing zones.  The type of aircraft that use them determines runway classifications.  Class B runways are used by large aircraft such as refueling and airlift aircraft as well as high-speed tactical aircraft.  Class A runways are designed to be used by smaller and lighter aircraft such as  propeller  driven  aircraft,  some  of  the  smaller  training  jet  aircraft,  gliders,  and  some remotely piloted vehicles.   Air Force airfield Clear Zones begin at the end of the runway for airfields operated by the Air Force and are rectangles that run along the extended centerline of the runway.  Installations previously granted permission for reduced size Clear Zones for their Class B runways will now reflect the standard 3000 foot x 3000 foot Clear Zones in all AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   17  AICUZ  studies.    Figure  3.1  is  a  graphical  depiction  of  the  fixed  wing  aircraft  Clear  Zones and APZs, and the dimensions are in Table 3.1. Figure 3.1.  Clear Zones and Accident Potential Zones. Table 3.1.  Clear Zone and Accident Potential Zone Dimensions.

The Clear Zones and APZs at  Joint Bases with  airfields operated by another Service will  be  determined  by  the  Component  operating  the  airfield(s)  (T-0).    The  operating   18  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 Component  will  identify  dimensions  for  Clear  Zones  and  APZs  per  existing  Component guidance to be used to implement the AICUZ program in accordance with DOD 4165.57 (T-0).  More stringent or other specified Service criterion Clear Zones and APZs may be used if the supporting and supported Components agree. 3.2.4.  MAJCOMs  with  permanent  overseas  installations  will  determine  whether  Air  Force AICUZ Clear Zones and APZs or International Civil Aviation Organization/North American Treaty  Organization  (ICAO/NATO)  Clear  Zones  will  be  used  for  on-base  planning  and development  purposes.    Both  the MAJCOM and the base will retain documentation of the determination of which guidelines are being applied (T-2). 3.2.5.  Air Force Clear Zones and APZ and the associated land use compatibility criteria do not apply to runways at Joint Use airfields where the Air Force does not own or control the runways.    The  Air  Force  should  engage  with  the  airport  authority  and  encourage  them  to acquire ownership of the runway protection zones as discussed in the FAA Advisory Circular 150/5300-13A, Airport Design, Section 310. 3.3.  Modifications  to  Fixed  Wing  APZs.  Installations proposing modifications to  their APZs should be aware that the Air Force’s accident analysis has been conducted independent of flight tracks and does not support anything other than straight APZs bounding the runway centerline.  However,  modifications  to  Air  Force  APZs  may  be  considered  based  on  the  conditions  listed below. 3.3.1.  All active runways will retain the traditional APZs aligned with the runway centerline.  However, if more than 80% of the total runway  departures or arrivals are on a single flight track that turns before the end of APZ  II, the installation  may propose  adding a new set  of APZS  that  follow  the  curved  line  of  flight.    Proposals  for  new  APZs  are  sent  to AFCEC/CPPR and AFLOA/JACE for review and approval. 3.3.2.  Local accident history indicates consideration of a different area. 3.3.3.  Proposals  for  including  curved  APZs  should  be  forwarded,  with  appropriate justification,  to  AFCEC/CPPR  and  then  to  MAJCOM  AICUZ  program  managers  for MAJCOM  EMT  and  AFLOA  JA  liaisons’  review  and  discussion  and  final  A4CI  or equivalent approval. 3.4.  Rotary  Wing  Aircraft  Clear  Zones  and  Accident  Potential  Zones.  Clear  Zones  for rotary wing runways and helipads for visual and standard instrument flight rules (IFR) operations are 400 feet long with varying widths.  The Clear Zone length for Army and Air Force IFR same direction  ingress  and  egress  is  825  ft.    The  single  APZ  length  for  a  rotary  wing  runway  and helipad  is  800  feet  long.    More  detailed  discussion  on  rotary  wing  APZs  and  Clear  Zones  for rotary wing aircraft can be found in UFC 3-260-01 Chapter 4. 3.5.  Noise.  Although  there  are  a  number  of  noise  sources  on  an  air  installation,  the  dominant source  is  typically  aircraft  operations.    AICUZ  studies  for  a  typical  air  installation  do  not typically  reflect  noise  from  military  or  civilian  vehicles,  generators  or  Aerospace  Ground Equipment (AGE).  Joint Bases are likely to have military noise sources other than aircraft that need to be included in the Joint Base AICUZ study.  The metrics and the depiction of noise level contours in an AICUZ study are as follows: AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   19  3.5.1.  Aircraft Noise.  Use the DNL noise descriptor to describe aviation noise environment in  the  AICUZ  study,  except  in  California,  where  the  CNEL  noise  descriptor  is  used.  However  for  purposes  of  on-base  planning  and  land  use  compatibility,  DNL  is  used  in  the Installation Development Plan.  If State law requires some other descriptor, it may be used in addition to DNL/CNEL.   DNL represents the sound level for a 24-hour period with a 10 dB weighting  imposed  on  aircraft  operations  during  the  nighttime  hours  of  10  p.m.  to  7  a.m.  CNEL  is  the  same  as  DNL  except  for  an  additional  5  dB  weighting  imposed  on  aircraft operations during the evening hours of 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.  Use DNL at overseas bases for on-base planning and land use compatibility purposes.  Noise contours for the off-base aviation noise environment at overseas bases are prepared only in consultation with HQ PACAF and HQ  USAFE  and  are  based  on  the  host-nation  noise  descriptors.    Note:  Neither  DNL  nor CNEL represent the actual sound level experienced at any point in time. 3.5.1.1.  A-weighted  DNL/CNEL  noise  zones  reflecting  the  current  mission  operations are developed by using an installation’s aircraft operation and maintenance data and the latest DOD approved version of the NOISEMAP noise model (or in combination with the Advanced Acoustic noise model as appropriate).  The DNL/CNEL noise zones are based on Average Annual Day (AAD) in accordance with DODI 4165.57, and copies of noise model input and output files are to be provided to AFCEC/CPPR. 3.5.1.2.  DNL  noise  contours  of  65,  70,  75,  80,  and  85  dB  are  be  plotted  and  used  to analyze land use compatibility in the AICUZ study, and plot CNEL levels of 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 dB for California installations.  Noise contours below DNL 65 dB are not required but may be provided if local conditions warrant discussion of lower noise levels, such  as  in  rural  and  desert  areas,  or  where  significant  noise  complaints  have  been received from areas outside DNL 65 dB. 3.5.2.  Non-Aircraft  Noise.  At  Joint  Bases  where  both  aircraft  operations  and  ground training  activities  (small  arms,  large  caliber  weapons  or  explosives)  occur,  do  not  combine the aircraft A-weighted  DNL/CNEL, C-weighted large caliber  DNL,  and  Peak Noise zones for small arms into a single set of noise zones for the AICUZ study. 3.5.2.1.  Small  Arms  Ranges.    The  un-weighted  peak  sound  pressure  level  noise descriptor  is  used  to  describe  the  noise  environment  for  small  arms  (.50  caliber  and below)  ranges,  and  are  generated  by  the  Small  Arms  Range  Noise  Assessment  Model (SARNM).  Because the noise zones for small arms are based on the loudest weapon and not the number of annual operations conducted at the range, if there are multiple weapon types being fired at one or multiple locations, the peak contours reflect the loudest level that occurs at each receiver location.  For small arms ranges, plot two noise zones, 87-104 dB Peak, and >104 dB Peak, for analyzing land use compatibility. 3.5.2.1.1.  Since  the  sound  of  small  arms  is  relatively  localized  when  compared  to other weapon systems, noise is typically only a concern up to 1000 meters behind the firing  point.    However  since  the  direction  of  fire  may  not  always  be  directly  away from the boundary, noise modeling should be used when the range footprint is within 3000  meters  of  the  boundary.    NOTE:    Ground  ranges  are  defined  using  metric measures therefore US measurement system is not used for distances associated with ground training ranges.   20  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 3.5.2.1.2.  Small arms range noise zones are to be included in an AICUZ study under the following circumstances: 3.5.2.1.2.1.  At  Joint  Bases  where  their  small  arms  training  is  a  major  noise source. 3.5.2.1.2.2.  There  is  a  history  of  community  noise  concerns  related  to  the  small arms range. 3.5.2.1.2.3.  The  noise  zones  from  the  small  arms  range  extends  off  the installation. 3.5.2.1.3.  Although small arms range noise can be included in an AICUZ study as a way  to  provide  information  to  local  communities  about  small  arms  range  noise, installations  that  use  their  small  arms  ranges  infrequently  should  consider  whether asking  local  communities  to  incorporate  land  use  controls  for  small  arms  noise  is warranted.  Other  considerations  may  include  if  aircraft  noise  is  the  dominate  noise source, or if the noise from small arms training tempo has the possibility of increasing in the future. 3.5.2.2.  Artillery/Explosives.  Use C-weighted Day-Night Average Noise Level (CDNL) noise  descriptor  to  describe  the  noise  environment  for  ground  training  ranges  involving the live fire of large caliber (greater than 20 mm) munitions and detonation of explosives.  Contours developed using the Blast Noise Model, (BNOISE), are averaged over 250 days for Joint Bases with ground training activities.   CDNL noise contours of 57, 62 and 70, are plotted for purposes of land use compatibility. 3.5.3.  Planning contours.  Long-range planning by local land use authorities involves long-range strategies to influence present and future uses of land.  Frequent  AICUZ updates and changes  to  land  use  recommendations  by  the  Air  Force  can  undermine  a  community’s willingness  to  adopt  AICUZ  land  use  recommendations  into  their  comprehensive  plan  or enact land use controls over the AICUZ footprint.  Therefore, in addition to current mission contours,  updated  AICUZ  studies  will  include  a  description  of  the  long-term  (5-10  year) aircraft  noise  environment  for  projected  aircraft  operations  that  is  consistent  with  the planning horizon used by State, tribal, regional and local planning bodies (T-2). 3.5.3.1.  Base  these  projections  on  the  best  available,  realistic  long-range  projections  of unclassified estimates of future mission requirements, including reasonable projections of future operations based on trends in operational tempo, retirement of legacy aircraft, new aircraft entering the inventory, etc. 3.5.3.2.  These  long-range  projections  are  not  commitments  of  future  operations,  nor should they be portrayed that way in the AICUZ study.  Inclusion of planning contours in the  AICUZ  study  does  not  eliminate  the  need  to  conduct  appropriate  environmental analysis  if  an  assumption  used  in  the  development  of  the  planning  contours  becomes  a proposed Air Force action. 3.5.3.3.  In situations where reasonable estimates of projected aircraft operations are not available, the local land use authorities are not open to long-range projections, or where little  or  no  change  to  aircraft  operations  is  expected  in  the  next  five  to  10  years,  the AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   21  current  contours  may  be  used  to  represent  the  long-range  future  instead  of  a  separate planning contour. 3.6.  Hazard  to  Aircraft  Flight  Zone  (HAFZ).  Certain  land  uses  and  activities  can  pose potential hazards to flight.  The zone is defined as the area within the “Imaginary Surfaces” that are described in the UFC 3-260-01, and in Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 77, Objects Affecting  Navigable  Airspace,  Subpart  C,  Obstruction  Standards.    Land  uses  proposed  in  this area should be evaluated for compatibility.  More information on this zone can be found in AFH 32-7084. 3.6.1.  Height.  Tall objects can pose significant hazards to flight operations or interfere with navigational equipment (including radar).   City/County agencies involved with approvals of permits  for  construction  should  require  developers  to  submit  calculations  which  show  that projects meet the height restriction criteria of FAA Part 77, for the specific airfield described in the AICUZ study. 3.6.2.  Visual Interference.  Activities that result in smoke, dust, or steam or may otherwise cause  interference  with  flight  activities  are  not  compatible  with  air  operations.  Smoke generated by nearby businesses, industry, or field-burning operations can create severe visual interference during air operations. Dust and smoke can be created  by fire (controlled burns, agricultural  burning),  ground  disturbance  (agricultural  operations,  grading),  industrial activities, or similar processes. 3.6.3.  Light  Emissions.  Sources  of  direct  or  indirect  light  emissions  become  a  land  use compatibility  issue  when  the  following  conditions  occur.    Aircrews,  maintainers,  air  traffic controllers or airfield operations personnel are unable to obtain necessary distance of view, or distinguish airfield surfaces, markings, or lighting; cannot see other air traffic or obstructions; or cannot properly train  due to artificial light sources affecting nighttime training activities.  Light sources can include spotlights, streetlights, laser light shows, fireworks, buildings with reflective glass surfaces, and some solar energy technologies. 3.6.3.1.  Glint/Glare potential from Photovoltaic (PV) Panels.  The potential for glint and glare from PV panels is extremely rare.  However, depending on materials or the siting of the panels,  there may be the potential for  glint  and  glare impacts  to  Air  Traffic Control (ATC)  cabs  and  or  pilots  on  approach  to  airfields.    Use  the  Department  of  Energy’s Sandia National  Laboratory Solar Glare Hazard Analysis Tool (SGHAT), in accordance with DODI 4165.57, to  determine whether PV arrays could create a glint/glare problem within HAFZ. 3.6.3.1.1.  Standards  for Objection. 3.6.3.1.1.1.  Due  to  the  fixed  location  of  air  traffic  control  facilities,  prolonged exposure  to  glare  has  the  potential  to  affect  safety  of  operations;  therefore  zero glare from PV panels is the compatibility standard at the ATC cab. 3.6.3.1.1.2.  The  standard  for  glint/glare  on  approach  or  during  other  tactical maneuvers  near  the  airfield  is:  no  potential  for  glint/glare  or  low  potential  for after-image along the final approach path or future landing thresholds.  SGHAT is configured  to  automatically  evaluate  straight  in  approaches  using  a  three-degree glide path.  At installations where military aircraft execute tactical approaches or overhead patterns, to include closed patterns, or have glide slopes other than three   22  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 degrees,  supplement  the  standard  SGHAT  analysis  to  ensure  there  are  no operational impacts from proposed PV arrays.  Plot a series of observation points along the alternate final approach paths and conduct an SGAHT analysis for each point. 3.6.3.1.2.  Mitigating  circumstances  may  be  present  which  would  warrant  a determination  that  notwithstanding  the  results  of  an  SGHAT  or  other  glint/glare analysis,  the  potential  mission  impact  associated  with  a  proposed  solar  PV  array  is within  an  acceptable  range.    Use  Air  Force  Risk  Management  principles  and procedures,  defined  in  AFI  90-802,  Risk  Management  and  AF  Pamphlet  (AFPAM) 90-803,  Risk  Management  (RM)  Guidelines  and  Tools  to  further  assess  risks determined  by  the  glint/glare  evaluation.    The  risk  assessment  should  consider  the following: 3.6.3.1.2.1.  Recorded Weather Conditions-Does the incidence of glint/glare occur during  a  calendar  period  where  local  climatic  conditions  result  in  regular occurrences of overcast conditions. 3.6.3.1.2.2.  Frequency  of  operations  on  affected  runways/flight  tracks  during glint periods. 3.6.3.1.2.3.  Frequency and duration of “after image” risk periods. 3.6.3.1.2.4.  Runway use practices.  Is it a main runway critical to accomplish the mission or one that is used infrequently? 3.6.3.1.2.5.  Planned  or  potential  change  in  use  due  to  airfield  improvements  or mission changes. 3.6.3.1.2.6.  Other  existing  glint/glare  sources  (i.e.  flat  (lake)  water  bodies, structures).  Are there existing conditions that have greater potential for glint/glare than the proposed PV panel array? 3.6.3.1.2.7.  Other installation specific operational considerations. 3.6.4.  Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH).  Assess the development of potential bird attractants, such as storm water management ponds, landfills, and waste transfer stations, wildlife refuges and agricultural uses against BASH criteria. 3.6.5.  Radio  Frequency/Electromagnetic  Interference  (RF/EMI).  Location  of  land  uses that  create  radio  frequency  or  electromagnetic  interference  can  directly  affect  signal  and electronic testing mission. In addition to mission disruptions, these uses can create HERP or HERO as ordnance is transported.  Identify and map safe travel corridors for ordnance, both on and off base. These maps can be used during engagement with local and regional planning organizations to minimize incompatible development. 3.7.  Areas of Critical Concern Beyond the AICUZ Footprint.  The Air Force Encroachment Management program has identified areas where there may be additional land use compatibility concerns  in  areas  beyond  the  traditional  AICUZ  footprint,  based  on  encroachment  challenges defined in AFI 90-2001. 3.7.1.  Line  of  Sight/Look  Angle  Zones.    Because  signals  being  transmitted  from  radars, radar/radio relay sites, telemetry equipment, radio antennas, etc. can be diffracted, refracted, AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   23  reflected and attenuated, installations will develop line of sight zones to help ensure that the height  and  location  of  manmade  structures  or  equipment  within  that  corridor  is  compatible with mission activities/equipment that require uninterrupted line of sight or look angles. (T-2). 3.7.1.1.  These  zones  must  consider  the  location,  longitude,  latitude  and  height  above ground level, of both the signal source and receiver, the radar look angles, and in addition to  a  clear  field  of  view  for  antennas,  the  Fresnel  Zone  of  signal  travel.    Compatibility recommendations  for  these  zones  may  more  likely  be  built  around  height  and  location restrictions  rather  than  specific  land  uses  as  used  for  other  compatibility  zones.    More information on developing compatibility recommendations for these zones can be found in  AFH  32-7084.    The  Communication  squadron  and  MAJCOM  spectrum  managers should assist in defining these zones. 3.7.1.2.  AFCEC/CPPR,  AFLOA/JA  and  MAJCOM  Encroachment  Management  Teams will  review  proposed  line  of  sight/look  angle  zones  and  compatibility  criteria  (T-1).   MAJCOM  EMTs  will  provide  final  approval  of  the  proposed  line  of  sight/look  angle /zone for inclusion in the installation’s AICUZ study as an additional compatibility zone. 3.7.1.3.  MAJCOM  EMTs  will  ensure  the  installation  spectrum  manager  is  included  in the  review  of  any  proposed  development  that  either  would  or  could  violate  the recommended height restrictions in these zones.  MAJCOM EMTs will ensure the review is incorporated into the AF Spectrum Interference Resolution (AFSIR) Program, which is governed by AFI 10-707 Spectrum Interference Resolution Program. 3.7.1.4.  If  the  installation  determines  that  there  is  little  to  no  chance  that  development that  would  interfere  with  the  line  of  sight  or  look  angles  necessary  for  the  operation  of this the  AICUZ  program implementation and maintenance plan, and no line of site zone needs to be developed. type  of  equipment  would  occur,  document this in 3.8.  Land Use Compatibility Guidelines.  The Air Force recommended land use compatibility guidelines for Clear Zones, APZs and aircraft noise can be found in Attachments 2 (Table A2.1) and  3  (Table  A3.1).    Land  use  compatibility  guidelines  for  noise  zones  from  small  arms,  large caliber munitions and explosives training conducted at Joint Bases can be found in Tables A3.2 and A3.3. 3.8.1.  The  land  use  recommendations  in  these  tables  are  based  on  the  Federal  Highway Administration’s  Standard  Land  Use  Coding  Manual  (SLUCM).    The  SLUCM  standards, including  their  codes  and  sub-codes,  provide  planners  with  detailed  information  describing specific land use categories.  Additions to some land use categories have been incorporated, subsequent to the issuance of the SLUCM, into the tables in Attachments 2 and 3 to reflect additional land uses and to clarify the categorization of certain land uses for the purposes of the  AICUZ  study.    The  Clear  Zones  and  APZs  and  noise  guidelines  were  developed specifically  for  airfield  operations.    NOTE:  SLUCM  standards  only  group  similar  types  of land  use  and  do  not  reflect  noise  sensitivity  or  population  density  that  may  influence  a particular land use is compatible or incompatible. 3.8.2.  To  ensure  accurate  review  of  land  use  plans,  zoning  ordinances  or  development proposals,  it  is  critical  that  the  AICUZ  program  manager  is  aware  which  land  use classification/coding  system  the  community/county  is  using:  SLUCM  or  the  Land  Based   24  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 Classification  System  (LBCS).    If  the  community  is  using  LBCS,  the  AICUZ  program manager may need to cross-walk the communities land use classifications with the two digit SLCUM codes used in the AICUZ land use recommendation tables in order to make it easier for  local  planning  authorities  to  identify  possible  incompatible  land  uses.    Additionally, AICUZ  program  managers  should  be  familiar  with  the  more  detailed  three  and  four  digit SLUCM  break out  to  get  a better understanding  of the  full range of land use  activities that fall under the broader two digit categories used in the AICUZ tables.  A copy of the SLCUM is posted on the AFCEC SharePoint site. 3.9.  Clear Zone Land Use Compatibility.  The Clear Zone is the area that has the greatest risk of accidents after the runway itself based on analysis of historic aircraft accident locations near military  airfields.    Because  of  this  high  risk,  the  Clear  Zone  warrants  special  attention.    The potential  for  accidents  is  so  high  that  that  the  land  use  restrictions  necessary  to  ensure compatibility would prohibit reasonable economic use of the land.  Therefore, it is DOD and AF policy  to  own  the  land  within  the  Clear  Zone,  or  control  the  land  through  restrictive  use easements.  Although primarily designed to protect people on the ground from accident potential, the  area  should  remain  as  clear  as  possible  to  minimize  objects  that  could  increase  damage should an aircraft accident occur. 3.10.  Accident  Potential  Zone  Land  Use  Compatibility.  The  percentage  of  accidents  that have occurred within the two APZs is such that purchase of the property within the APZs by the Air Force is  not  necessary;  however, some type  of land use control is  essential.  The DoD and Air Force recommendation is limiting the number of people exposed through land use planning.  The land use guidelines for APZs are founded on the concept of minimizing density of land use in the vicinity of the installations.  In addition to limiting density, certain types of land use such as  residential,  educational  facilities,  and  medical  facilities  are  considered  incompatible  and  are strongly discouraged in APZs.  To assist local governments in implementing land use controls in APZs,  recommended  floor  area  ratios  (FARs)  are  provided  for  select  commercial  uses.    The following sections provide a general characterization of the recommended types of land use for each APZ. 3.10.1.  The  accident  potential  in  APZ  I  is  less  than  the  Clear  Zone,  but  still  possesses  a significant  risk  factor.    This  area  has  land  use  compatibility  guidelines  that  are  sufficiently flexible  to  allow  reasonable  economic  use  of  the  land,  such  as  industrial/manufacturing, transportation,  communication/utilities,  wholesale  trade,  open  space,  recreation,  and agriculture. However, uses that give rise to high concentrations of people in small areas are not appropriate. 3.10.2.  The accident potential in APZ II is less than APZ I, but still possesses a significant potential for accidents.  Within APZ II, acceptable uses include those compatible within APZ I,  as  well  as  low-density  single  family  residential  and  those  personal  and  business  services and  commercial/retail  trade  uses  of  low  intensity  or  low  scale  of  operation.  High-density functions  such  as  multi-story  buildings,  places  of  assembly  (theaters,  churches,  schools, restaurants, etc.), and high-density office uses are not considered compatible. 3.11.  Land  Use  Compatibility  for  Noise.  Long-term  land  use  compatibility  with  noise resulting from the operation of military aircraft should minimize the effects on people, animals (domestic and wild), and structures on or in proximity to the installation.  Nearly all studies on residential aircraft noise compatibility recommend no residential uses in noise zones above DNL AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   25  75 dB DNL.  Usually, no restrictions are recommended below noise zone DNL 65 dB DNL.  The area between 65-75 dB DNL noise contours may not qualify for Federal mortgage insurance in residential  categories according to  the Department  of Housing and Urban  Development  (HUD) Regulation  24  CFR  51,  Environmental  Criteria  and  Standards,  Part  B  Noise  Abatement  and Control.    In  many  cases,  HUD  approval  requires  noise  attenuation  measures,  the  Regional Administrator’s  concurrence,  and  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement.      The  Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA) also has airfield noise and accident restrictions that apply to its home loan guarantee  program.    Whenever  possible,  residential  land  use  should  be  located  below  DNL  65 dB DNL. 3.11.1.  Although  Table  A3.1  states  that  residential  land  uses  can  be  made  compatible  by adding adequate noise attenuation to reduce the interior noise level to 45 dB DNL with the windows closed, the exterior noise levels cannot be reduced.  DOD and Air Force guidelines recommend that local communities evaluate whether or not there is a demonstrated need for residential use that would not be met if residential development were prohibited in high noise zones before considering allowing residential development in high noise zones. 3.11.2.  Most  industrial/manufacturing  uses  are  compatible  in  the  airfield  environs.  Exceptions  are  uses  such  as  research  or  scientific  activities  that  require  lower  noise  levels and/or may be affected by vibration.  It is recommended that noise attenuation measures be added  to  those  areas  of  buildings  devoted  to  office  use,  receiving  the  public,  or  where  the normal background noise level is low. 3.11.3.  The  transportation,  communications  and  utilities  categories  have  a  high  noise  level compatibility  because  they  generally  are  not  people-intensive.    When  people  use  land  for these  purposes,  the  use  is  generally  very  short  in  duration.    Additional  evaluation  is warranted when buildings are required for these uses, additional. 3.11.4.  The  commercial/retail  trade,  and  personal  and  business  services  categories  are compatible without restriction  up to  70 dB DNL; however, they are  generally incompatible above  80  dB  DNL.    Between  70-80  dB  DNL,  noise  level  reduction  measures  should  be included in the design and construction of buildings. 3.11.5.  The nature of most  uses in  the public  and quasi-public services category  requires a quieter environment, and attempts should be made to locate these uses below 65 dB DNL or else provide adequate noise level reduction. 3.11.6.  Although  recreational  use  has  often  been  recommended  as  compatible  with  high noise  levels,  in  areas  above  75  dB  DNL,  noise  becomes  a  factor  that  limits  the  ability  to enjoy  such  uses.    Where  the  requirement  to  hear  is  a  function  of  the  use  (i.e.,  music  shell, etc.), compatibility is limited.  Buildings associated with golf courses and similar uses should be  noise  attenuated.    People  who  are  outdoors  in  areas  above  80  dB  DNL  should  consider wearing hearing protection when aircraft noise is present. 3.11.7.  With  the  exception  of  forestry  activities  and  livestock  farming,  most  uses  in  the resources  production,  extraction,  and  open  space  category  are  compatible  without restrictions. 3.12.  Energy Related Land Uses.  Because of the changing needs of military test and training, the  broad  array  of  energy  related  land  uses,  and  the  continual  emergence  of  new  energy technologies, there are no pre-defined or generic “energy development zones” for airfields nor is   26  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 there  a  definitive  yes/no  answer  when  it  comes  to  energy  compatibility.    Typically,  energy related  land  uses  are  not  identified  on  land  use  plans  or  on  zoning  maps  so  AICUZ  program managers  and  others  involved  in  encroachment  management  to  be  actively  watching  for  these kinds of development proposals. 3.12.1.  Land uses related to energy development, including  support infrastructure, fall under a range of SLUCM codes.  The more traditional energy related land uses are identified under several  SLUCM  codes.    Electrical  transmission  rights  of  way  (and  for  AICUZ  purposes transmission  lines),  electric  generation  plants  and  substations  fall  under  two  digit  SLUCM code 48 and more specifically code 481.  Gas pipeline rights of way, gas production plants, natural/manufactured gas storage and distribution fall under the three-digit SLUCM code 482 and  petroleum  pipeline  right  of  ways  and  other  types  of  pipeline  rights  of  way  are  under SLCUM code 491.  Coal mining, crude oil and natural gas drilling/mining fall under SLUCM code 85.  The newer forms of renewable energy development is not included in the SLUCM but for purposes of AICUZ, large scale (i.e. commercial sized) energy development projects such  as  nuclear,  solar,  wind  and  geothermal,  and  biomass  should  be  considered  a  form  of electrical generation and classified under SLUCM code 48. 3.12.2.  Typically  utility  related  land  uses  may  not  be  identified  on  a  local  land  use  map, AICUZ  program  managers  may  learn  about  local  incentives  to  attract  renewable  energy development  to  the  area  or  local  or  state  permits  for  energy  development.    Like  any  other type  of  land  development  proposal,  evaluate  proposed  energy  projects  for  mission compatibility issues.  There are no specific land use compatibility criteria for energy related land  uses  outside  the  APZs;  however,  energy  projects  proposed  to  be  located  within  the HAFZ  can  be  evaluated  using  the  potential  effects  identified  in  Paragraph  3.6  as  a  starting point. 3.12.3.  The AICUZ program managers and IEMTs must consider the following three factors when  evaluating  the  compatibility  or  potential  for  mission  impacts  of  proposed  energy development  or  transmission  line  projects:    the  technology  (solar,  wind,  geo-thermal, biomass);  the  location  of  the  proposed  development  and  the  mission  requirements  (T-1).  Consider  the  following  mission  compatibility  concerns  for  various  types  of  energy  projects when evaluating the compatibility of a proposed development: 3.12.3.1.  The AICUZ program managers and IEMTs will evaluate wind turbine projects for  possible  radar  interference  to  airfield  and  weather  radars,  long-range  radars  and aircraft-borne radar and for hazards to flight (T-1). 3.12.3.2.  Geothermal projects should be evaluated to determine whether the height of the steam  towers  would  create  hazards  to  flight,  and  if  the  steam  could  create  visual interference.  Depending on the type of geothermal technology and location of the plant, evaluate the  potential for ice fog. 3.12.3.3.  Solar  energy  technologies  such  as  PV  panel  arrays  or  concentrating  solar power,  which  use  reflective  materials  like  mirrors  and  lenses  to  concentrate  sunlight  to generate thermal energy, need to be evaluated for glint and glare issues for pilots and/or the air traffic control cab.  Evaluate the potential for thermal updrafts from solar towers.  Note:  Such  updrafts  typically  dissipate  at  distances  beyond  50  feet,  so  standard separation  distances  between  aircraft  and  objects  on  the  ground  may  mitigate  this concern. AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   27  3.12.3.4.  The  AICUZ  program  managers  and  IEMTs  will  evaluate  biomass  power generating  plant  designs  and  locations  to  determine  if  the  emissions  stacks  create  an obstruction.  (T-1).    Evaluate  whether  or  not  the  emissions  (dust/smoke/steam)  will obscure  pilot  or  ATC  vision;  and  whether  the  design  of  the  biomass  feedstock  storage area  could  attract  birds,  wildlife  or  their  prey  and  therefore  contribute  to  increased potential for BASH. 3.12.3.5.  All  electricity  producing  energy  projects  need  to  be  linked  to  transmission lines.    The  project  evaluation  should  also  evaluate  the  compatibility  of  any  new  above ground  transmission  lines  that  would  be  required  to  connect  the  source  to  the  electrical grid. Table A2.1 includes compatibility criteria for transmission lines in the APZs. 3.12.3.6.  Installations can engage with energy developers if they find out about proposed energy  development  projects  that  may  have  the  potential  to  impact  their  mission; however  there  are  limits  on  what  installation  personnel  can  tell  the  developer.    Should installation  personnel  find  out  about  a  proposed  energy  development  prior  to  it  coming through  the  OSD  Clearinghouse  process,  it  is  highly  recommended  that  the  issue  be elevated  to  the  MAJCOM  EMT  lead  for  further  guidance.    The  DoD  Siting Clearinghouse  of  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Undersecretary  of  Defense,  Installations  and Environment,  coordinates  the  DoD  assessment  of  all  renewable  energy  projects  to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts on military operations, in accordance with 32 CFR, Part 211. Additional information on this process can also be found in Attachment 15 of AFI 13-201. 3.13.  Applicability of AICUZ to Air Force Land and Facilities. 3.13.1.  General  Information.    New  Air  Force  facility  sitings,  construction  and  land  use designations  within  the  IDP  must  be  consistent  with  the  land  use  compatibility recommendations  in  Tables  A2.1  and  A3.1,  and  height  restrictions  for  that  installation  (see Attachment  5,  AICUZ  Study,  Appendix  D,  AFH  32-7084)  and  Tables  A3.2  and  A3.3  for Joint Bases (T-1).  Any land uses proposed for Air Force lands within the AICUZ footprint that  are  not  consistent  with land  use  recommendations  will  require documentation justifying the proposed incompatible development and appropriate approvals prior  to  planning  and  programming  the  project.    The  specific  documentation  and  approvals are detailed in the following paragraphs. the  AICUZ 3.13.2.  Land  Use  in  the  Clear  Zone.  Existing  Air  Force  facilities  and  land  uses  may continue; however the Base Civil Engineer will program replacement facilities as part of the normal  planning  and  programming  process  and  site  such  replacement  facilities  outside  the Clear  Zone  (T-2).    People  intensive  facilities  and  facilities  not  related  to  flight  operations should be relocated outside the Clear Zones where possible.  Navigational aids and essential operational  requirements  are  exceptions,  which,  because  of  their  functions  may  need  to  be located in the Clear Zone for optimum performance. 3.13.2.1.  The  Air  Force  (or  others  under  Air  Force  permit)  will  not  plan,  site,  or construct  a  new  use  or  facility  within  the  boundaries  of  the  Clear  Zone  except  for  the following allowed land uses consistent with DODI 4165.57 (T-0): 3.13.2.1.1.  Agriculture, with the exception of orchards (trees), grains, or other crops or vegetation that unnecessarily attract birds or wildlife.   28  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 3.13.2.1.2.  Livestock grazing (excluding feed and dairy lots). 3.13.2.1.3.  Permanent open space. 3.13.2.1.4.  Existing  water  areas  provided  they  do  not  create  bird  or  wildlife  strike hazards. 3.13.2.1.5.  Rights-of-way  for  single  track  railroads,  and  fenced,  two-lane  roads without  sidewalks  or  bicycle  trails,  provided  that  they  do  not  violate  obstacle clearance criteria or the graded portion of the Clear Zone. 3.13.2.1.6.  Rights of way for communications and utilities provided all facilities and equipment are at grade level or underground. 3.13.2.1.7.  Essential navigation aids and operational facilities, provided there are no feasible alternative locations (MAJCOM approval is required). 3.13.2.2.  The following uses are specifically prohibited within the Clear Zone: 3.13.2.2.1.  A use that releases any substance into the air that would impair visibility or otherwise interfere with operating aircraft, such as, but not limited to steam, dust, and smoke. 3.13.2.2.2.  A  use  that  produces  electrical  emissions  which  would  interfere  with aircraft  and  Air  Force  communications  equipment,  navigational  aid  systems,  radar, weapons systems, or aircraft navigational equipment. 3.13.2.2.3.  A use that produces light  emissions, either direct or indirect (reflections, glare,  etc.),  which  might  interfere  with  a  pilot’s  or  air  traffic  control  personnel’s vision. 3.13.2.2.4.  A use that would unnecessarily attract birds, waterfowl, or other animals, such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  operation  of  sanitary  landfills,  maintenance  of  feeding stations, or growing certain types of crops or vegetation. 3.13.2.2.5.  Explosives  facilities  or  activities  as  described  in  AFMAN  91-201, Explosive Safety Standards. 3.13.2.3.  Consistent  with  applicable  historic  preservation  requirements,  the  Base  Civil Engineer must demolish or relocate buildings on newly acquired fee land within the Clear Zone and must ensure the rubble is removed (T-1).  Easement acquisitions must conform to  the  real  estate  acquired.    Through  programing  avenues,  the  Base  Civil  Engineer  is responsible for any further relocation of above ground utilities, fencing, and any grading or seeding.  In addition, the Base Civil Engineer determines what is done with roads and sidewalks that terminate in the acquired area. 3.13.2.4.  Installations are required to have a MAJCOM approved Safety Zone Variance prior  to  planning  and  programming  any  construction  of  new  facilities  or  installation  of equipment, including above ground infrastructure such as lights, pumps, etc, (other than as noted above) in the Clear Zone (T-2).  The AICUZ program manager or base planner coordinates the installation’s Safety Zone Variance package (Attach 4) through the IEMT prior to submitting the package to the MAJCOM EMT for final MAJCOM CV approval. AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   29  3.13.2.4.1.  Project managers will file a copy of the variance package and approval in the project  file, and the AICUZ program manager will include the variance package in the development project information called for in paragraph 2.18.3.7 (T-3). 3.13.2.4.2.  Copies of variance package paperwork should accompany any paperwork for projects that require higher headquarters approval. 3.13.2.5.  Project  managers  ensure  that  alterations,  minor  additions,  or  improvements  to facilities currently in the Clear Zone have a completed safety zone variance package that explains why the functions in those facilities have to remain in the Clear Zone instead of being  relocated  outside  the  Clear  Zone  in  accordance  with  paragraph  3.13.2.    The MAJCOM  EMT  must  approve  the  variance,  with  explicit  concurrence  from  the MAJCOM/A3, and Safety offices. 3.13.3.  Development in the APZs.  Prior to planning and programming any facility/land use on  Air  Force  land  in  an  APZ  that  is  not  consistent  with  AICUZ  guidelines,  the  Base  Civil Engineer  obtains an IEMT approved Safety Zone Variance.  The AICUZ program manager will keep a copy on file of the completed variance package as part of the development project information called for in paragraph 2.18.3.7 (T-3). 3.13.4.  Development  in  the  Noise  Zones.  Proposals  that  locate  land  uses/facilities  in  the noise zones that are not consistent with the guidelines require a written justification as to why they  have  to  be  located  in  the  noise  zones  and  what  mitigations  have  been  considered  to minimize the incompatibility.  The AICUZ program manager will ensure this documentation is included in the development project information and the project file, and included in any package that must be sent forward to the MAJCOM EMT for approval (T-2). 3.13.5.  On-Base Renewable Energy Projects.  The Base Civil Engineer ensures all on-base proposed renewable energy projects and associated support infrastructure (transmission lines, etc.)  are  consistent  with  the  compatible  land  use  recommendations  in  Table  A2.1  for  Clear Zone and APZs and evaluated for compatibility with the mission if they are proposed to be located in areas of the HAFZ.  SGHAT is used to evaluate the compatibility of small or large commercial  size  PV  arrays  during  the  siting  process  in  accordance  with  DODI  4165.57.  More information on glint/glare is in in section 3.6.3.   30  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 4 AICUZ STUDY AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION 4.1.  General.  While  the  most  obvious  component  of  the  program  is  the  AICUZ  study,  a successful program requires continuous awareness of local planning and development activities and  active  external  engagement  with  local  communities.    Six  phases  of  the  AICUZ  program reoccur on a continuous basis.  The first five focus on the study itself and cover data collection, validation, preparation of maps, study preparation and the public release of the study. The sixth phase  centers  on  the  installation’s  implementation  and  maintenance  responsibilities  and activities.  This section summarizes the first five phases, additional detail on all six phases is in AFH 32-7084. 4.2.  The  AICUZ  Study.  The  AICUZ  study  is  the  backbone  of  the  program  and  provides  the necessary  information  communities  need  to  pursue  compatible  development.    The  study describes  air  operations  and  depicts  the  compatibility  zones  for  accident  potential,  noise  and other  installation  specific  areas  of  critical  concern  along  with  land  use  compatibility recommendations  for  the  zones.    The  compatibility  recommendations  are  based  on  the relationships between the existing and future military mission, existing land use and zoning and planned or anticipated development, as well as the strategies the Air Force has taken to manage and implement the AICUZ program.  Phases I-V are described in more detail in Attachment 5.  The outline and template for the AICUZ study is in AFH 32-7084. 4.3.  Joint Base AICUZ Studies.  Where the Component installations were contiguous and both airfields have fixed and/or rotary wing aircraft operations, the supporting Component will be the lead  to  develop  a  single  AICUZ  study  that  covers  all  airfields.    For  Joint  Bases  that  have geographically  separate  airfields,  (and  each  Component  conducts  fixed  and  or  rotary  wing aircraft operations on their respective airfields) the supporting Component is the lead to develop a separate AICUZ study for each airfield in accordance with DODI 4165.57  (T-0).  If the Joint Base has a geographically separate site where the supported component conducts ground training but no airfield operations, create a separate Installation Compatible Use Zones (ICUZ) Study for that site of the Joint Base in accordance with AICUZ DODI 4165.57. 4.4.  Exemptions from preparing and releasing an AICUZ Study. 4.4.1.  An  installation  may  be  exempt  from  publishing  an  AICUZ  study  if  the  following conditions exist: 4.4.1.1.  If  an  installation’s  AICUZ  footprint  does  not  extend  beyond  the  installation boundary.  Review current mission and planning noise contours, as well as APZs, HAFZ and  any  identified  areas  of  critical  concern  to  determine  the  full  geographical  extent  of the AICUZ footprint. 4.4.1.2.  There are less than 10 jet or 25 propeller-driven aircraft operations on an average annual day. 4.4.1.3.  There are less than 250 helicopter operations on an average annual day. 4.4.1.4.  The  installation  is  located  on  a  Joint  Use  Airfield  as  described  in  paragraphs 1.3.2 and 1.3.3. AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   31  4.4.2.  Installations  exempt  from  publishing  an  AICUZ  study  are  not  exempt  from  the biennial  review  of  airfield  operations  (or  ground  training  operations  for  Joint  Bases)  to determine  if  changes  in  their  operations  have  caused  noise  contours  to  extend  off  the installation. 4.4.3.  Installations will forward requests for exemptions to AFCEC/CPPR AICUZ staff. (T-1).  AFCEC/CPPR will then conduct a review of the installation’s AICUZ and forward their the  respective  MAJCOMs  for  EMT  review  and assessment  and  conclusions approval/disapproval  of  a  requested  exemption inform AFCEC/CPPR and A4CI regarding the rational for any approved exemptions.   MAJCOMS  will to (T-2). 4.5.  Updating  the  AICUZ  Study.  As  noted  in  Section  3.5.6,  frequent  updating  of  AICUZ studies can result in local communities not adopting AICUZ land use recommendations.  Ideally, the planning contours should result in less frequent updating; however, at some point an update will likely be required due to mission changes and subsequent changes in noise contours or the addition of areas of critical concern.  Details on when and how to update an AICUZ study are in Attachment 5. 4.6.  AICUZ  Program  Implementation  and  Maintenance.  This  is  one  of  the  most  critical phases of the program.  During this phase, the installation must play an active role in local and area-wide  planning  and  participates  in  the  review  of  local  and  state  plans  and  programs  in accordance  with  DODI  4165.57  (T-0).    The  success  of  the  AICUZ  program  depends  on  local government  acceptance  as  well  as  actions  by  private  individuals  and  other  agency  officials.  Local  officials  need  to  understand  the  AICUZ  program  to  effectively  implement  the  AICUZ recommendations.  The Air Force’s role then becomes one of insuring that private and/or public organizations and interested citizens have the necessary information on which to base a decision, not  engaging  in  a  high-pressure  “selling”  exercise  in  the  community  or  pressuring  local authorities  to  enact  zoning  or  adopt  the  AICUZ  recommendation.    The  Air  Force  encourages increased  public  understanding  through  a  continuous  flow  of  public  information  from  the installation  and  by  the  installation’s  participation  in  interagency  and  intergovernmental coordination and planning processes  at  the local,  area-wide,  and federal  regional levels.   Phase six  AICUZ  implementation  and  maintenance  responsibilities  are  delineated  in  Paragraphs 2.18.3.1 through 2.18.3.25.  Additional  detail  on these  responsibilities can be found in  in  AFH 32-7084. 4.6.1.  Joint  Land  Use  Study  Program.  Often  local  communities  need  assistance  to determine what steps they need to take to incorporate the AICUZ land use recommendations into their land use and comprehensive plans, and zoning.  Congress has authorized DOD to provide  planning  assistance  to  local  communities  to  address  encroachment  issues.    The Office  of  Economic  Adjustment’s  (OEA)  Compatible  Use  Program  provides  direct  federal assistance  to  help  states  and  communities  work  with  the  Military  Services  to  prevent  and mitigate impacts where encroachment of the civilian community impairs the use of military installations.  Technical and financial assistance is available through a Joint Land Use Study (JLUS)  to  partner  with  the  local  military  to  plan  and  carry  out  strategies  promoting compatible civilian use adjacent to an installation complex, including related ranges, special use airspace  and associated military training  routes and military operations areas.  Through the community-driven JLUS  planning process,  adjacent  communities and often the state, in partnership  with  the  installation,  identify  and  evaluate  a  wide  range  of  both  existing  and potential future encroachment challenges that may impair the continued operational utility of   32  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 the military installation complex.  The affected communities then develop a strategic action plan to  identify specific actions, responsible parties, and a proposed timeline to  address  the encroachment  challenges.    The  JLUS  is  a  partnership  between  OEA  and  the  local communities.    The  installation’s  role  in  the  JLUS  process  is  advisory,  providing  technical information  on  noise,  safety  and  installation’s  flight  and/or  ground  training  activities  in  the case of Joint Bases. 4.6.2.  Joint  Land  Use  Study  Nominations.  JLUS  Nominations  are  submitted  by  the MAJCOMS  in  response  to  an  annual  A4CI  call  letter.    MAJCOMS  should  consider nominating an installation or range if civilian development has impaired or is likely to impair the continued operational utility of the installation complex.  To assist OEA to understand the encroachment challenges, all nominations need to include the following information: 4.6.2.1.  A description of the nature and extent of the incompatible civilian development, or the potential for such incompatible civilian development. 4.6.2.2.  A  statement  affirming  the  installation  leadership’s  commitment  to  support  a JLUS. 4.6.2.3.  A  statement  regarding  the  status  of  the  AICUZ  study  and  any  encroachment study  (external  or  internal  ICEMAP),  or  Comprehensive  Range  Plan.      Installations should  indicate  whether  the  AICUZ  noise  contours  represent  the  current  mission  or  if they  are  planning  contours.    If  an  installation’s  AICUZ  study  is  being  updated,  include information on when it is expected to be completed and released. 4.6.2.4.  Points of contact at the Major Command and nominated installation or range. 4.6.2.5.  A  statement  of  the  reasonable  expectation  that  the  affected  local  government would likely participate in a JLUS. 4.6.3.  Coordinated  Air  Force  Planning.  Any  installation  or  range  planning  activity  that may  affect  or  be  affected  by  or  may  involve  off-base  activities  (e.g.  AICUZ,  Installation Development  Plan  or  other  activities,  such  as  actions  taken  under  the  authority  granted  in Title 10 USC, Section 2684a, the ICEMAP, etc.) and any ongoing or pending JLUS efforts should be done in  coordination  with  each other.   Establishing effective communication and coordination  of  interrelated  efforts  is  instrumental  in  developing  integrated  strategies  to achieve  mutual  goals  and  objectives  to  sustain  an  installation  complex’s  future  ability  to support mission changes. AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   33  Chapter 5 ACQUISITION OF REAL PROPERTY INTERESTS 5.1.  General.  Although  noise  generated  by  military  aircraft  is  an  integral  element  of  land  use compatibility efforts, the acquisition of property interests on the basis of noise by the Air Force may not be in the best interests of the United States because noise contours change based on the type of aircraft and number and type of operations.  Therefore, the following priorities apply to any program to acquire real estate interests to ensure land use compatibility: 5.2.  Priorities. 5.2.1.  Clear  Zone.    The  first  priority  area  is  the  acquisition  of  the  Clear  Zone  in  fee  or appropriate restrictive easements of land whenever practicable. 5.2.2.  The  next  highest  priority  is  the  APZs  followed  by  the  HAFZ,  Line  of  Sight/Look Angle  Zones  followed  by  the  high  noise  zones.    Acquisition  of  interests  should  only  be considered when all possibilities of achieving compatible zoning, or similar protection, have been exhausted (or the area is not subject to zoning) and the operational integrity of the air installation  or  mission  is  manifestly  threatened.    If  acquisition  is  considered  necessary, complete  records  documenting  all  discussions,  negotiations,  testimony  with  or  before  all local  officials,  boards,  or  commissions,  should  be  maintained.    This  ensures  that documentation  is  available  to  indicate  that  all  reasonable  and  prudent  efforts  were  made  to preclude incompatible land use through cooperation with local government officials and that all recourse to such action has been exhausted. 5.2.3.  Guidelines. 5.2.3.1.  This Instruction cannot be used as sole justification for either the acquisition or the  retention  of  owned  interests  beyond  the  minimum  required  to  protect  the Government. 5.2.3.2.  If fee title is currently held or subsequently acquired in an area where compatible uses  could  be  developed,  and  there  is  no  requirement  for  fee  interest  except  to  prevent incompatible use, disposal actions should be considered in the following situations:  the parcel  can  be  easily  severed,  the  disposal  generates  no  additional  cost  or  disposal proceeds or maintenance cost avoidance are more advantageous to the Air Force. 5.2.3.3.  Retain  only  those  rights  and  interests  necessary  to  establish  and  maintain compatible  uses.    Where  proceeds  from  disposal  and  costs  of  retaining  title  would  be inconsequential, consideration may be given to retaining title. 5.3.  Authorities and Methods. 5.3.1.  The  necessary  rights  to  real  property  within  the  defined  compatible  use  zone  or mission critical area may be obtained by purchase, exchange, or donation, in accordance with all  applicable  laws  and  regulations.    In  addition  to  traditional  land  acquisition  methods  for acquiring  real  property  interests,  such  as  negotiated  purchase  through  military  construction authorization or minor land acquisition authority, there are other options available. 5.3.2.  10  USC,  Section  2684a.  This  statute  authorizes  the  Air  Force  to  enter  into agreements  with  eligible  entities  such  as  States,  political  subdivisions  of  the  state,  or  other   34  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 qualified  private  entities  with  conservation  or  land  restoration  goals  to  address  the  use  or development  of  real  property  in  the  vicinity  of,  or  ecologically  related  to,  a  military installation or military airspace. 5.3.2.1.  The  purpose  of  such  an  agreement  is  to  limit  incompatible  development  or preserve  habitat  in  a  manner  that  may  eliminate  or  relieve  current  environmental restrictions  that  might  restrict  or  interfere  directly  or  indirectly  with  military  training, testing or operations on an installation.  The agreement shall provide for the acquisition of  real  property  interests  in  the  property  as  may  be  appropriate.    The  cost  of  the acquisition of real property interests is to be shared by both the Air Force and the eligible entity.  Opportunities exist when there are shared interests that can be achieved through a transaction.    To  use  this  authority,  there  must  be  a  “partner,”  (i.e.  authorized  eligible entity) and a landowner who is a willing seller. 5.3.2.2.  To  assist  the  Services  with  projects  under  this  authority,    OSD  established  the Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) Buffer Program as a source of  funding.    Air  Force  guidance  for  the  REPI  Buffer  Program  states  that  the  projects should enhance Air Force operational requirements for current and future mission needs.  In regards to the AICUZ program, REPI Buffer Program funds cannot be used to acquire interests in the Clear Zone.  Any REPI projects should be part of a larger comprehensive compatible land use strategy. 5.3.3.  10 USC Section 2663(c) and (e)(2) allows the Air Force to acquire minor interests in land  needed  for  national  defense  by  gift,  purchase,  or  exchange.    Whether  the  land acquisition is considered a minor interest  acquisition is determined by the upper dollar cost thresholds  described  in  Section  2663(c).    10  USC  Section  2664  defines  limitations  on  real property acquisition. 5.3.4.  10  USC  Section  2869  allows  the  Air  Force  to  enter  into  an  agreement  to  convey closure,  realignment,  or  excess  Air  Force  real  property  to  any  person  who  agrees,  in exchange  for  the  real  property,  to  transfer  to  the  United  States  all  ownership  rights  of  the person to  a parcel  of real  property, or who  agrees to  carry out  a land acquisition, including the  fee  acquisition  or  acquisition  of  a  lesser  interest  in  real  property  under  an  agreement entered  into  under  10  USC  Section  2684a  to  limit  encroachments  and  other  constraints  on military training, testing, and operations. 5.3.5.  Federal, State, and/or local agencies and private conservation organizations may work together to acquire or provide funding for land and water conservation projects that also can contribute to protecting the installation mission from incompatible development. 5.3.6.  Local  communities  or  counties  have  purchased  land  or  easements  to  support  AF missions.    Communities  might  choose  to  acquire  land  to  achieve  long-term  planning  goals and may be willing to work with the installation to identify parcels that meet both their and the installation’s needs for open space. 5.3.7.  Exchanging  land  between  the  Air  Force  and  a  state  or  Federal  agency,  a  landowner,  local  government,  or  other  legal  entities  is  another  strategy  to  prevent  incompatible development that may be executed using appropriate authorities. AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   35  5.4.  Real Estate Interests in the Clear Zones. 5.4.1.  The  Base  Civil  Engineer  should  initiate  the  process  of  acquiring  a  real  property interest  in  fee  or  through  appropriate  restrictive  easements  over  all  land  within  the  Clear Zones whenever practicable.  In the event adjacent land is owned by another federal agency, obtain formal agreements to restrict land use.  HQ USAF/A4C, in coordination with SAF/IEI will determine exceptions to  Clear  Zone boundary  (as set  forth  in Section 3.2) and the  real property interest to be acquired on a case-by-case basis.  The only real property interests to be  acquired  are  those  necessary  to  prevent  incompatible  land  use,  or  to  prohibit  uses generating increased incompatibility (e.g.  increased density, increased structure height, etc.) in the Clear Zone (except at certain Joint Use airfields that are exempt from the Clear Zone acquisition program, as discussed in section 1.3). 5.4.2.  The  Installation  is  responsible  for  identifying  private  lands  within  the  Clear  Zone, determining  the  real  property  interest  to  be  acquired,  and  funding  the  acquisitions  through programming  avenues.    The  Base  Civil  Engineer  initiates  the  process  of  acquiring  real property interests IAW AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property).  The MAJCOM should inform  HQ  USAF/A4CI,  AFCEC/CI,  and  AFCEC/CPPR  concerning  proposed  acquisition actions under this chapter. 5.4.2.1.  Real estate interests to be considered for acquisition include: 5.4.2.1.1.  The right to  make low and frequent flights over said land and to generate noises associated with: 5.4.2.1.1.1.  Aircraft in flight, whether or not directly over said land. 5.4.2.1.1.2.  Aircraft and aircraft engines operating on the ground. 5.4.2.1.1.3.  Aircraft engine test stand/cell, and hush-house operations. 5.4.2.1.2.  The  right  to  regulate  or  prohibit  the  release  into  the  air  of  any  substance that would impair the visibility or otherwise interfere with the operations of aircraft, such as, but not limited to steam, dust and smoke. 5.4.2.1.3.  The  right  to  limit  or  prohibit  light  emissions,  either  direct  or  indirect (reflective), visible or invisible, including lasers, that might interfere with pilot vision, performance of instruments equipment, weapon systems or airfield operations. 5.4.2.1.4.  The  right  to  prohibit  electromagnetic  emissions  that  would  interfere  with aircraft and aircraft sensors, aircraft  communications  systems,  weapons systems,  or aircraft navigational equipment. 5.4.2.1.5.  The  right  to  prohibit  any  use  of  the  land  that  would  unnecessarily  attract birds  or  other  animals,  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  operation  or  sanitary  landfills, maintenance  of  feeding  stations  or  the  growing  of  certain  types  of  vegetation attractive to birds or other animals. 5.4.2.1.6.  The  right  to  prohibit  and  remove  any  buildings  or  other  non-frangible structures. 5.4.2.1.7.  The right to top, cut to ground level, and to remove trees, shrubs, brush or other forms of obstruction that the installation commander determines might interfere with the operation of aircraft, including emergency landings.   36  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 5.4.2.1.8.  The  right  of  ingress  and  egress  upon,  over  and  across  said  land  for  the purpose of exercising the rights set forth herein. 5.4.2.1.9.  The right to post signs on said land indicating the nature and extent of the Government’s control over said land. 5.4.2.1.10.  The right to prohibit land uses other than the following: 5.4.2.1.10.1.  Agriculture (except such uses that would attract birds). 5.4.2.1.10.2.  Livestock  grazing (except  managed intensive grazing, concentrated animal feeding operations, feedlots, dairy herds, and intensive animal husbandry). 5.4.2.1.10.3.  Permanent  open  space  (open  space  recreational  use,  is  authorized only if it  conforms to the compatibility guidelines in Attachment 2). 5.4.2.1.10.4.  Existing water areas. 5.4.2.1.10.5.  Rights-of-ways for fenced two-lane highways without sidewalks or bicycle trails provided that they do not violate obstacle clearance criteria or cross the graded portion of the clear zone. 5.4.2.1.10.6.  Rights-of-way  for  single-track  railroads  without  terminals,  or platforms so long as rail traffic does not extend into the flight path. 5.4.2.1.10.7.  Communications  and  utilities  right-of-way,  provided  all  facilities are at or below grade. 5.4.2.1.11.  The right to prohibit entry of persons onto the land except in connection with activities otherwise authorized. 5.4.2.1.12.  The  right  to  disapprove  land  uses  not  in  accordance  with  Table  2.1, Attachment 2. 5.4.2.1.13.

Documentation  of  Real  Property  Interests  Acquired  in  Support  of  the  AICUZ Program.  In  addition  to  recording  the  easements  in  the  real  property  inventory,  maintain readable  copies  (paper  copies  or  digital  copies)  of  the  restrictive  use  easements,  aviation easements or other less than fee simple interests at the installation to ensure they are available for review by installation personnel working encroachment issues.  The location of the land areas for which the Air Force has acquired an interest are included on a data layer in accordance with the latest  appropriate  Real  Property  geospatial  data  layers  (parcels,  installation  area,  etc.)  as maintained by Air Force GeoBase Program and AFCEC/CPPR. 5.6.  Monitoring  Terms  of  Easements.  The  installation  AICUZ  program  manager  and installation RPO monitor the real property interests acquired through restrictive use easements to ensure that any restrictive use easements remain enforceable over time. AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   37  Chapter 6 GEOSPATIAL DATA 6.1.  General.  The  AICUZ  program  is  heavily  reliant  on  geospatial  data  when  it  comes  to analyzing  the  compatibility  of  land  uses  and  mission  activities.    Most  of  the  AICUZ  area  of influence lies outside the installation and requires the acquisition and use of geospatial data that comes from external sources, as well as Air Force generated geospatial data layers.  Ensure all geospatial  data  used  in  support  of  the  AICUZ  program  adheres  to  the  latest  AICUZ  geospatial model as maintained by Air Force GeoBase Program and AFCEC/CPPR. 6.2.  AICUZ geospatial data layers created by the Air Force or its contractors may consist of: 6.2.1.  Historic  DNL/CNEL  noise  contours-plotted  in  5  dB  increments  starting  with  65  dB DNL and going to 80 dB. May start at 60 dB in some locations. 6.2.2.  Current DNL/CNEL noise contours-plotted in 5 dB increments starting with 65+ and going to 80.  May start at 60 dB in some locations. 6.2.3.  Planning DNL/CNEL contours (if used)- plotted in 5 dB increments starting with 65+ and going to 80.  May start at 60 dB in some locations. 6.2.4.  Current Peak Noise Contours for Small Arms Ranges: two contours, 87-104 dB Peak, and >104 dB Peak. 6.2.5.  Historic Peak Noise Contours for Small Arms Ranges: two contours, 87-104 dB Peak, and >104 dB Peak. 6.2.6.

number  of  daily airfield operations  that would occur during a 24—hour period based on 365 flying days per year.  Calculate Average Annual Day operations by dividing the total annual airfield operations by 365. Attenuation−—A  decrease  in  a  property,  as  energy,  per  unit  area  of  a  wave  or  a  beam  of particles, occurring as the distance from the source increases as a result of absorption, scattering, spreading in three dimensions. Avigation Easement−A perpetual and assignable, non—exclusive easement and right-of-way, appurtenant  to  a  specified  installation  or  training  area,  for  the  free  and  unobstructed  use  and passage  of  all  types  of  aircraft  together  with  the  right  to  create  or  cause  in  the  airspace  such noise,  vibrations,  odors,  vapors,  exhaust,  smoke,  dust,  light,  fuel  particles  or  other  effects  that may be inherent in the lawful operation of aircraft in the process of landing at or taking off from or operating at, on, over, or in the vicinity of the installation or training area, notwithstanding the AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   43  extent  of  interference  that  such  activities  may  have  upon  the  use  or  value  of  the  underlying landowner's remaining estate. C—weighted  Day-Night  Average  Sound  Level  (CDNL  or  symbol  LCdn)−C-weighting  is applied  to  the  DNL  metric  for  low-frequency  impulsive  sounds,  such  as  sonic  booms,  heavy weapons,  and  other  explosions  because  they  are  perceived  by  humans  not  only  by  the  ear,  but also by the whole body  as pressure or vibration.  When experienced indoors, impulsive sounds can create secondary noise from rattling and vibrations of the building.  See DNL for additional discussion. Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL [symbol L—den])−CNEL is similar to DNL but adds an evening penalty of 5 dB to all operations occurring between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., in addition to the night penalty of 10 dB from 10:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m.  CNEL is used  for  land  use  planning  and  environmental  analysis  for  all  installations  in  the  State  of California.    (See  also  DNL.)    NOTE:  The  symbol  Lden  should  not  be  confused  with  the  noise descriptor  used  in  Japan,  Day,  Night,  Evening  Level,  abbreviated  Lden.    Although  CNEL  and Lden  are  similar,  in  that  each  has  an  evening  penalty,  CNEL  defines  evening  as  a  three  hour period and Japan defines evening as a four hour period. Diffraction−—The  phenomenon  exhibited  by  wave  fronts  that,  passing  the  edge  of  an  opaque body are modulated, thereby causing a redistribution of energy within the front. Day Night Average Sound Level  (DNL  [symbol: Ldn]−The equivalent sound level from all noise events occurring during a 24—hour period with an additional 10 dB penalty imposed on operations occurring during the nighttime hours (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.), and then averaged together with  moments  of  quiet.    DNL  is  the  primary  noise  metric  used  for  describing  long-term  noise impacts  for  sub-sonic  aircraft  operations  and  is  the  primary  metric  used  to  describe  the  noise environment in the airfield vicinity. Fresnel Zone−The area around the visual line of—sight that radio waves spread out into after they leave the antenna. This area must be clear or else signal strength will weaken. Hazards to Aircraft Flight Zone−This zone is defined as the area on the ground within the “Imaginary  Surfaces”  that  are  described  in  the  UFC  3—260-01,  and  in  Federal  Aviation Regulation  (FAR)  Part  77,  Objects  Affecting  Navigable  Airspace,  Subpart  C:  Obstruction Standards.  This is the area that will be evaluated for the compatibility related to height, visual interference, glint/glare, bird/wildlife aircraft strike hazard, and radio frequency/electromagnetic interference. Installation  Complex−—The  land,  facilities,  airspace  and  ranges  providing  direct  mission support  to  and/or  are  managed  by  the  installation.  This  includes  a  combination  of  land  and facilities comprised of a main installation and its noncontiguous properties (auxiliary air fields, annexes,  and  missile  fields)  that  provide  direct  support  to  or  are  supported  by  that  installation. Installation complexes may comprise two or more properties, e.g., a major installation, a minor installation, or a support site, each with its associated annex(es) or support property(ies). Installation Complex Encroachment Management Action Plan (ICEMAP)−—The ICEMAP document documents the results of a comprehensive encroachment study addressing current and future encroachment and sustainment challenges facing the installation complex and surrounding communities.   44  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 team Installation  Encroachment  Management  Team established  in  accordance  with  section  3.3.2.3  of  AFI  90-2001,  designed  to  address encroachment issues within the installation complex. (IEMT)−A  cross—functional Land Based Classification System−—The Land Based Classification Standards (LBCS) model extends  the  notion  of  classifying  land  uses  by  refining  traditional  categories  into  multiple dimensions,  such  as  activities,  functions,  building  types,  site  development  character,  and ownership constraints. Each dimension has its own set of categories and subcategories. Noise contour line−—Lines on a map connecting points of equal noise levels. Noise Zone− A range of noise levels generally bounded by two noise contours, e.g. 66—70 dB DNL. Operational  Data−—Operational  data  covers  multiple  types  of  data  associated  with  aircraft operations. Peak  Sound  Pressure—(PK  [Symbol  Lpk])−Measured  in  decibels  (dB)  is  the  highest instantaneous sound pressure that occurs during a given time period.  Lpk is used to describe a single noise event such as a sonic boom or blast and relate it to human and animal response. Peak sound levels are not weighted. Reflection−—The act of casting back (light, heat, sound, etc) from a surface. Refraction−—The  change  of  direction  of  a  ray  of  light,  sound,  heat,  or  the  like,  in  passing obliquely from one medium into another in which the speed of propagation differs.  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   45  LAND USE COMPATIBILITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR APZS Attachment 2 A2.1.

A “Yes” or a “No” designation for compatible land use is to be used only for general comparison.  Within each, uses exist where further evaluation may be needed in each category as to whether it is clearly compatible, normally compatible, or not compatible due to the variation of densities of people and structures.  In order to assist air installations and local governments, general suggestions as to FARs are provided as a guide to density in some categories.  In general, land use restrictions that limit occupants, including employees, of commercial, service, or industrial buildings or structures to 25 an acre in APZ I and 50 an acre in APZ II are considered to be low density.  Outside events should normally be limited to assemblies of not more than 25 people an acre in APZ I, and maximum assemblies of 50 people an acre in APZ II.  Recommended FARs are calculated using standard parking generation rates for various land uses, vehicle occupancy rates, and desired density in APZ I and II.  For APZ I, the formula is FAR = 25 people an acre/ (Average Vehicle Occupancy x Average Parking Rate x (43560/1000)).  The formula for APZ II is FAR = 50/ (Average Vehicle Occupancy x Average Parking Rate x (43560/1000)).  2.  The suggested maximum density for detached single-family housing is two Du/Ac.  In a planned unit development (PUD) of single family detached units, where clustered housing development results in large open areas, this density could possibly be increased slightly provided the amount of surface area covered by structures does not exceed 20 percent of the PUD total area.  PUD encourages clustered development that leaves large open areas.  3.  Other factors to be considered:  Labor intensity, structural coverage, explosive characteristics, air-pollution, electronic interference with aircraft, height of structures, and potential glare to pilots.  4.  No structures (except airfield lighting and navigational aids necessary for the safe operation of the airfield when there are no other siting options), buildings, or above-ground utility and communications lines should normally be located in Clear Zone areas on or off the air installation.  The Clear Zone is subject to the most severe restrictions.    5.  Roads within the graded portion of the Clear Zone are prohibited.  All roads within the Clear Zone are discouraged, but if required, they should not be wider than two lanes and the rights-of-way should be fenced (frangible) and not include sidewalks or bicycle trails.  Nothing associated with these roads should violate obstacle clearance criteria.  6.  No above ground passenger terminals and no above ground power transmission or distribution lines.  Prohibited power lines include high-voltage transmission lines and distribution lines that provide power to cities, towns, or regional power for unincorporated areas.  7.  Development of renewable energy resources, including solar and geothermal facilities and wind turbines, may impact military operations through hazards to flight or electromagnetic interference.  Each new development should to be analyzed for compatibility issues on a case-by-case basis that considers both the proposal and potentially affected mission.    50  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015  8.  Within SLUCM Code 52, maximum FARs for lumberyards (SLUCM Code 521) are 0.20 in APZ-I and 0.40 in APZ-11;  the maximum FARs for hardware, paint, and farm equipment stores, (SLUCM Code 525), are 0.12 in APZ I and 0.24 in APZ II.  9.  A shopping center is an integrated group of commercial establishments that is planned, developed, owned, or managed as a unit.  Shopping center types include strip, neighborhood, community, regional, and super-regional facilities anchored by small businesses, a supermarket or drug store, discount retailer, department store, or several department stores, respectively.    10.  Ancillary uses such as meeting places, auditoriums, etc. are not recommended.  11.  No chapels or houses of worship are allowed within APZ I or APZ II.  12.  Big box home improvement stores are not included as part of this category.  13.  Facilities must be low intensity, and provide no playgrounds, etc.  Facilities such as club houses, meeting places, auditoriums, large classes, etc., are not recommended.    14.  Activities that attract concentrations of birds creating a hazard to aircraft operations should be excluded.  15.  Factors to be considered: labor intensity, structural coverage, explosive characteristics, and air pollution.  16.  Lumber and timber products removed due to establishment, expansion, or maintenance of Clear Zone lands owned in fee will be disposed of in accordance with applicable DoD guidance.  17.  Controlled hunting and fishing may be permitted for the purpose of wildlife management.  18.  Surface mining operations that could create retention ponds that may attract waterfowl and present bird/wildlife aircraft strike hazards (BASH), or operations that produce dust or light emissions that could affect pilot vision are not compatible.  19.  Naturally occurring water features (e.g., rivers, lakes, streams, wetlands) are pre-existing, nonconforming land uses.  Naturally occurring water features that attract waterfowl present a potential BASH.  Actions to expand naturally occurring water features or construction of new water features should not be encouraged.  If construction of new features is necessary for storm water retention, such features should be designed so that they do not attract waterfowl.  20.  Amusement centers, family entertainment centers or amusement parks designed or operated at a scale that could attract or result in concentrations of people, including employees and visitors, greater than 50 people per acre at any given time are incompatible in APZ II.    AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   51  RECOMMENDED LAND USE COMPATIBILITY FOR NOISE ZONES Attachment 3 A3.1.  Suggested land use compatibility guidelines for noise zones are shown in Table A3  1.  Additions  to  some  land  use  categories  have  been  incorporated  into  Table  A3.1  subsequent  to issuance of the SLUCM to reflect additional land uses and to clarify the categorization of certain uses.

NLR (outdoor to indoor) is achieved through the incorporation of noise attenuation into the design and construction of a structure.  Land use and related structures are generally compatible; however, measures to achieve NLR of 25, 30, or 35 must be incorporated into design and construction of structures.  However, measures to achieve an overall noise reduction do not necessarily solve noise difficulties outside the structure and additional evaluation is warranted.  Also, see notes indicated by superscripts where they appear with one of these numbers.  DNL – Day-Night Average Sound Level.  CNEL – Community Noise Equivalent Level (normally within a very small decibel difference of DNL)  Ldn – Mathematical symbol for DNL.  NOTES:    1.  General       a. Although local conditions regarding the need for housing may require residential use in these zones, residential use is discouraged in DNL 65-69 and strongly discouraged in DNL 70-74.  The absence of viable alternative development options should be determined and an evaluation should be conducted locally prior to local approvals indicating that a demonstrated community need for the residential use AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   55  would not be met if development were prohibited in these zones.  Existing residential development is considered as pre-existing, non-conforming land uses.       b. Where the community determines that these uses must be allowed, measures to achieve outdoor to indoor NLR of at least 25 decibels (dB) in DNL 65-69 and 30 dB in DNL 70-74 should be incorporated into building codes and be considered in individual approvals; for transient housing, an NLR of at least 35 dB should be incorporated in DNL 75-79.         c. Normal permanent construction can be expected to provide an NLR of 20 dB, thus the reduction requirements are often stated as 5, 10, or 15 dB over standard construction and normally assume mechanical ventilation, upgraded sound transmission class ratings in windows and doors, and closed windows year round.  Additional consideration should be given to modifying NLR levels based on peak noise levels or vibrations.       d. NLR criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems.  However, building location, site planning, design, and use of berms and barriers can help mitigate outdoor noise exposure particularly from ground level sources.  Measures that reduce noise at a site should be used wherever practical in preference to measures that only protect interior spaces.  2.  Measures to achieve NLR of 25 must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or where the normal noise level is low.  3.  Measures to achieve NLR of 30 must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or where the normal noise level is low.  4.  Measures to achieve NLR of 35 must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or where the normal noise level is low.  5.  If project or proposed development is noise sensitive, use indicated NLR; if not, land use is compatible without NLR.  6.  Buildings are not permitted.  6.  Buildings are not permitted.  7.  Land use is compatible provided special sound reinforcement systems are installed.  8.  Residential buildings require an NLR of 25  9.  Residential buildings require an NLR of 30.  10.  Residential buildings are not permitted.  11.  Land use that involves outdoor activities is not recommended, but if the community allows such activities, hearing protection devices should be worn when noise sources are present. Long-term exposure (multiple hours per day over many years) to high noise levels can cause hearing loss in some unprotected individuals.     56  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 Table A3.2.

Communities  and  individuals  often  have  different  views  regarding  acceptable  or desirable levels of noise. To address this, some local governments have implemented land use planning measures  beyond  Noise  Zone  II  limits.    In  addition  to  mitigating  current  noise  impacts,  implementing such controls within the LUPZ can create a buffer to prevent the possibility of future noise conflicts.  Note  2:   Although  local requirements for  on-  or  off-base housing  may  require  noise-sensitive  land  uses within  Noise  Zone  II,  such  land  use  is  generally  not  compatible  within  Noise  Zone  II.    Measures  to achieve overall noise level reduction inside structures do not solve noise difficulties outside the structure.  Barriers are not effective reducing the noise from artillery and armor, the detonation of either large caliber military munitions or a large quantity of explosives.  Additionally, noise level reduction inside structures does not mitigate the vibration generated by the low-frequency energy of large caliber weapons firing and detonations. AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   63  Note  3:    Within  Zones,  existing  “noise  sensitive  land  uses  are  considered  as  pre-existing  incompatible land uses.  In most cases these uses are not a risk to either mission sustainment or a community’s quality of  life.    Most  long-term  members  near  Army  installations  or  activities  acknowledge  hearing  military operations and activities but they are usually not alarmed or bothered by the noise.  Note 4:  Although noise levels may be compatible, caution should be exercised in siting any activity which may be sensitive to vibration.    64  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 Attachment 4 CLEAR ZONE AND ACCIDENT POTENTIAL ZONE VARIANCE PACKAGE A4.1.  Variance  from  Compatibility  Criteria.  Installations  that  propose  to  deviate  from compatible land use criteria for on base structures/facilities are required to request a variance for deviation from criteria prior to construction, justifying the requirement and reason for deviation (T-1). A4.1.1.  A request for a variance to site a facility or non-airfield related equipment within the CZs and APZs is submitted by the base to the MAJCOM for approval.  Submit requests for variances prior to initiating any programming documents. A4.1.2.  Prior to submittal to the MAJCOM, the request for the variance has been presented to  the  IEMT  for  their  review,  comment,  and  coordination.    The  IEMT  Chair  and  the  Wing Commander coordinates with the airfield/airspace management and flight safety offices and develops  an  installation  position.    Documentation  of  the  IEMT  review  and  necessary coordination is be included as part of the package. A4.1.3.  The  IEMT submits  the package to  the  MAJCOM EMT for their review, comment, and coordination.  The MAJCOM EMT forwards the package to the MAJCOM CV for final decision on the variance. A4.1.4.  Existing incompatible AF facilities and land uses may continue in the CZs without a request  for  variance,  but  their  presence  is    documented  and  mapped  within  the  appropriate Real  Property  Geospatial  data  layer  as  maintained  by  the  AFCEC  Geospatial  Integration Office  (AFCEC/GIO)  and  AFCEC/CPPR.    The  Base  Civil  Engineer’s  office  programs replacement  facilities  as  part  of  the  normal  planning  and  programming  process,  including documenting  all  plans  for  replacement  of  nonconforming  facilities.    Site  all  replacement facilities  outside  the  CZs.    People-intensive  facilities  and  facilities  for  other  than  flight-operations  are  to  be  sited  outside  the  CZ  when  possible.  Navigational  aids  and  essential operational  requirements  are  exceptions,  which,  because  of  their  functions,  are  located  for optimum performance. A4.2.  Package Content.  The package includes, as a minimum, the following information: A4.2.1.  Narrative data. A4.2.1.1.  Installation name. A4.2.1.2.  Project Title and Land Use. A4.2.1.3.  Facility user/operator. A4.2.1.4.  Average number of people expected to occupy the facility. A4.2.1.5.  Noise contour and aircraft Sound Exposure Levels at the site. A4.2.1.6.  Provide  a  description  of  proposed  project,  and  compelling  reasons  why  the project  is  proposed to  be sited in the CZs or APZ.   Identify the siting requirements and factors  applied  in  the  site  selection  process  and  how  these  were  used  in  making  the decision.    Provide  any  proposed  design  considerations  being  proposed  to  minimize  the footprint  of  the  facility/equipment.  Provide  analysis  of  all  candidate  sites  outside  the safety zones and explain why they are not suitable. AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   65  A4.2.2.  Site Plan.  Show the proposed location of the project on the site plan along with and its  perpendicular  distance  from  the  extended  runway  centerline  along  with  alternative  sites outside the CZs and APZs which were considered but determined unacceptable. A4.2.3.  Risk Assessment for Siting in the Clear Zone. A4.2.3.1.  The  operational  risk  assessments  prepared  as  part  of  the  variance  request package  should  look  at  risk  from  two  aspects:  safety  risk  from  the  flight  operations (accident/noise) to the facility/equipment and any people occupying or using or servicing the  facility/equipment  and  the  safety  risk  to  the  aircraft  and  aircrew  from  the  proposed facility/equipment. A4.2.3.2.  The  risk  assessment  team  should  include  staff  from  Base  Civil  Engineering, Safety-(both  ground  and  flight  safety),  Bio-Environmental  office,  Operations  Squadron (airfield/airspace managers). A4.3.  Evaluation of Variance Package.  Consider and evaluate the following additional factors before approving a variance to site a facility or equipment in the CZs or APZs: A4.3.1.  Safety.    The  obvious  concern  within  the  safety  zones  is  an  aircraft  accident.  Therefore  siting  people-intensive  facilities  or  uses  within  the  safety  zones  that  are  not essential  to  flight  operations  and  not  consistent  with  land  use  recommendations  is contradictory  to  DOD  and  Air  Force  policies  which  recommend  against  uses  which  locate personnel  within  this  potentially  hazardous  area.  There  is  also  concern  for  air  crew  safety since buildings, structures, and irregular land forms can adversely affect aircraft recovery in the  event  of  take-offs  and  landing  problems.    Dropped  objects  and  navigational  aid interference are also safety concerns which should be considered.  Flying safety and airfield and  airspace  management  offices  should  provide  one  of  the  risk  assessments  as  well  as provide input regarding safety issue during the variance review process. A4.3.2.  The  following  uses  are  specifically  prohibited  within  the  CZs  and  are  not waiverable: A4.3.2.1.  Uses  that  release  into  the  air  any  substance  which  would  impair  visibility  or otherwise interfere with the operation of aircraft, e.g. steam, dust, and smoke. A4.3.2.2.  Uses  that  produce  light  emissions,  either  direct  or  indirect  (reflective),  which would interfere with pilot vision. A4.3.2.3.  Uses  that  would  attract  birds  or  waterfowl,  such  as  the  operation  of  sanitary landfills, maintenance of feeding stations, or growing of certain vegetation. A4.3.2.4.  Uses  that  produce  electromagnetic  emissions  which  would  interfere  with aircraft computer/communication systems or navigational equipment. A4.3.2.5.  Explosives  facilities  or  activities  as  described  in  AFMAN  91-201,  Explosive Safety Standards. A4.3.3.  Noise.  The CZs and some portions of the APZs are typically a high noise area with noise levels often exceeding 80 DNL.  The single event noise level, which takes into account not  only  the  actual  measured  noise  level,  but  the  length  of  the  exposure,  can  be  8-10  dB higher than the DNL level.  Because of the potential damage to hearing many land uses are incompatible  with  these  extremely  high  noise  levels.    The  installation  AICUZ  study  noise   66  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 contour  map  along  with  the  land  use  compatibility  table  (found  inAFI  32-7063)  for  noise provides a list  of suitable land uses for the noise levels  in the installation’s CZs and APZs.  AFOSH Standard 48-20 contains guidance on human exposure limits to noise and should be referred  to  in  the  variance  request.    The  bio-environmental  engineer  should  provide  input concerning the health effects of placing people in the CZ or APZs as related to noise levels as part in thevariance review package. A4.3.4.  Public  Perception.  Constructing  facilities  in  the  CZ  which  are  contradictory  to AICUZ land use guidelines sends a message to the public saying “Do as we say, not as we do” even though there might be a legitimate reason for placing a facility in the Clear Zone.  AICUZ guidance states that the overall risk is so high that the necessary land use restrictions would  prohibit  reasonable  economic  use  of  the  land.    If  an  installation  proposes  to  site residential, commercial, industrial, or recreational-type facilities on AF property in the Clear Zone,  however,  it  is  easy  to  understand  how  the  public  could  receive  a  mixed  message  on compliance  with  AICUZ  land  use  policies.    Constructing  such  facilities  in  the  Clear  Zone weakens the AF position opposing private development in APZs I or II that potentially could degrade flying missions and jeopardizes our credibility with Federal agencies such as HUD and VA, who support AICUZ through related program actions.  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   67  Attachment 5 PREPARING AND UPDATNG AN AICUZ STUDY  A5.1.  General.  The following sections discuss each of the Phases of the AICUZ program.  The first  five  phases  focus  on  the  study;  the  sixth  phase  focuses  on  the  day  implementation  and maintenance  responsibilities  of  the  installation  after  the  public  release  of  the  AICUZ  study.  A more detailed discussion on each phase can be found in AFH 32-7084. A5.1.1.  Phase I:  Data Collection.  There are two types of data collected in this phase: A5.1.1.1.  Operational  data  from  aircraft  flying  and  maintenance  activities,  as  well  as ground  testing  and  training  activities  for  Joint  bases  that  conduct  ground  training activities (small arms, artillery, etc.). A5.1.1.2.  Data  on  local  land  use  (existing  and  future),  zoning,  economic  development goals, population changes, planned developments, etc.  This phase also includes analysis of the land use data collected. A5.1.2.  Phase II−Operational Data Review and Validation.  This phase e provides quality assurance and quality control for operational data collected in phase I.  Because this data is the  basis  of  the  noise  contours,  accuracy  is  critically  important.    The  best  way  to  ensure accuracy is to have the operational data reviewed by the same people who were interviewed during  the  phase  I  data  collection.    AFCEC/CPP  AICUZ  staff  is  also  available  to  review operational data collected by contractors to determine whether all the necessary data has been collected.    AFCEC  review  of  the  data  is  not  a  substitute  for  the  review  and  validation  by installation personnel. A5.1.3.  Phase  III−Development  of  Noise  Contour  Map.  The  noise  contours  are developed either by AFCEC/CPPR AICUZ staff or a contractor.  The IEMT and MAJCOM staff  do  the  technical  review  of  the  noise  contours.    AFCEC/CPPR  AICUZ  staff  is  also available  to  review  contractor  prepared  noise  contours  after  being  provided  all  of  the  data collected  by  the  contractor.      After  making  all  the  corrections,  the  contractor  or  AFCEC prepares the final noise contour, and then it the contours are evaluated to determine whether the amount of change in the contours drives the need to update the AICUZ study. A5.1.4.  Phase  IV−Preparing  an  AICUZ  Study.  This  phase  includes  the  preparing  an AICUZ  study  updates  or  amendment.    These  updates  or  amendments  can  be  prepared  by contractors  or  with  in-house  staff.    The  community  brochure  and  implementation  and maintenance plan are also developed in Phase IV. A5.1.5.  Phase  V−Public  Release  of  AICUZ  Study  or  Amendment.  Once  the  AICUZ study  or  amendment  is  drafted,  copies  are  to  be  provided  to  AFCEC/CPPR  and  the MAJCOM EMT for review and comment to ensure legal adequacy and consistency with Air Force and MAJCOM policies.  Once the MAJCOM approves the release of the AICUZ study or  amendment,  five  copies  are  sent  up  to  A4CI  for  distribution  to  the  Congressional delegation.  Copies are to be received at least 10 days prior to the public release. A5.1.5.1.  The  release  of  the  study  to  the  general  public  and  local  and  area-wide government  officials  is  generally  done  by  the  Installation  Commander  at  a  public meeting, unless the MAJCOM has waived the requirement.   AFCEC/CPPR coordinates   68  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 the study with federal regional offices after public release.  After the public release, the installation ensures coordination of the study with state single points of contact. A5.1.5.2.  An amendment to an AICUZ study may be employed in place of a full AICUZ study if changes are few and minor in nature, if little explanation is needed, or no known controversy exists. A5.1.5.2.1.  An  amendment  consists  of  a  transmittal  letter  dated  and  signed  by  the Installation Commander, and the corrected pages for insertion into the latest AICUZ study.  Release an amendment as follows: A5.1.5.2.2.  Public  notification  of  the  release  is  accomplished  through  newspapers and other media two weeks in advance of the mail out of the release. A5.1.5.2.3.  Copies  of  the  amendment  are  mailed  simultaneously  to  all  recipients  of the last public release of the AICUZ study. A5.1.5.2.4.  Copies  are  sent  simultaneously  to  local  libraries,  agencies,  local governments, organizations, and individuals known to have an interest. A5.2.  Updating AICUZ Studies. A5.2.1.  General.  A full update of the AICUZ study is prepared if changes in current aircraft operations or a new mission results in an increase or decrease in the noise contours of two dB or  greater  in  a  residential  area  when  compared  to  the  noise  contours  in  the  previously published AICUZ study.   The two dB change in noise zones does not apply to ground-based training activities.  AFCEC/CPPR in consultation with the U.S. Army Public Health Center (MCHP-IP-EON) determines the need to update the noise zones for these activities. A5.2.2.  Biennial  Review  of  Operational  Data.  Biennial  validation  of  operational  data  is necessary to  determine the need for an  AICUZ update unless  an environmental  analysis on operational  activities  has  occurred  during  the  two-year  period.    If  the  biennial  review identifies  changes  to  operations  may  be  enough  to  cause  changes  to  the  noise  contours, follow Phases III-V. A5.2.2.1.  If small arms range noise zones are included in the AICUZ study, determine if there  have  been  any  changes  in  the  weapons  used  at  the  range,  or  the  types  of ammunition used.  If there are new arms or changes in ammunition used at the range, the installation  provides  the  information  on  any  changes  to  AFCEC/CPPR  who  in consultation  consult  with  the  U.S.  Army  Public  Health  Center  determines  if  the  noise zones need updating. A5.2.2.2.  The type of changes to large ordnance/explosive range operations which could drive an update include:  new mission, new training techniques, changes in firing points, changes in types of munitions or explosives, closing existing and/or opening new ground training ranges.  Because establishing a new range or firing points requires environmental analysis, the results from the environmental analysis since the last biennial review can be used  to  determine  the  need  for  an  update  of  the  noise  zones.    Provide  any  changes  in operational  data  to  AFCEC/CPPR,  who  in  consultation  with  U.S.  Army  Public  Health Command, Army  Institute of Public Health, MCHP-IP-EON, determines if an update to the noise zones is needed. AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015   69  A5.2.3.  Updates as a result of Environmental Analysis.  The noise contours developed for an  environmental  analysis  can  be  used  in  an  AICUZ  study  update  when  the  changes  in  the noise  levels  are  the  result  of  simple  modifications  of  existing  aircraft  operations.    Such changes  include  slight  increases  or  decreases  in  numbers  of  aircraft  and  associated  aircraft operations, or modifications to flight tracks or the way the aircraft are flown (e.g. changes in flight  profiles  or  use  of  after-burners).      The  AICUZ  study  update  should  be  accomplished within 180 days of implementation of the proposed action. A5.2.3.1.  If the proposed action analyzed is the beddown of aircraft new to the Air Force inventory,  a  formal  update  of  the  AICUZ  study  should  not  occur  until  the  aircraft  have arrived at the beddown location and the operational procedures, flight profiles and flight patterns are finalized and stable enough to allow for the review of flight operations. A5.2.3.2.  When  the  aircraft  operations  for  new  aircraft  beddown  are  well  defined, provide the noise contours and the compatibility analysis from the environmental analysis document and any other relative data to the local planning agencies to serve as in interim update  to  the  AICUZ  study  within  120  days  of  the  beddown  decision.    Disclose  the timeframe for a full update of the AICUZ study, in the transmittal letter.  Initiate the full update  of  the  AICUZ  after  the  aircraft  have  arrived,  operational  procedures  are established  and  flight  patterns  are  stable  enough  to  allow  for  the  production  of  more accurate noise contours. A5.2.3.3.  In  those  situations  where  the  operational  requirements  of  the  aircraft  are  not well  defined  or  is  still  undergoing  development,  transmittal  letters  should  disclose  the timeframe  for  a  full  update  and  discourage  local  communities  from  adopting  land  use changes  and  regulations  based  solely  on  the  noise  contours  generated  in  the environmental analysis. A5.2.4.  Updates  due  to  changes  other  than  Aircraft  Operations.  Although  AICUZ program  managers may  be monitoring specific land use  changes  and changes in  plans on a real time basis, it often means it is easy to overlook the larger overall trends.  To assist both the installation and the local communities in understanding the larger picture, it may benefit all  the  stakeholders  if  the  land  use  analysis  portion  of  the  AICUZ  study  is  updated periodically  to  reflect  the  current  land  use  environment.  Such  updates  can  be  the  basis  for renewed engagement with local  communities/counties regarding compatibility issues or can assist members of the IEMT or others to understand how incremental changes may result in large-scale  shifts  in  development  patterns.    Another  catalyst  for  updating  AICUZ  study would  be  to  include  newly  identified  areas  of  critical  concern  and  associated  compatibility criteria for those areas. A5.3.  Exemptions to AICUZ Study Updates. A5.3.1.  If the biennial review of the operational data and subsequent contour map indicates that  the  AICUZ  study  should  be  updated,  there  are  certain  circumstances  where  the preparation and release of an fully updated study may not be required or appropriate. A5.3.1.1.  An AICUZ study update is not required if the local community has adopted the AICUZ  study  and  the  applicable  zoning  ordinances  in  effect  meet  the  recommended compatible land uses for the reduced or expanded AICUZ footprint.  The lead planning   70  AFI32-7063  18 DECEMBER 2015 agency  should  have  a  written  request  on  file  with  the  Base  Civil  Engineer’s  office  for maintaining the existing AICUZ study. A5.3.1.2.  The local government acceptance of the AICUZ study recommendations must be  clearly  documented,  with  an  Airport  comprehensive  land  use  plan,  general  land  use plan, zoning ordinance and map or airport overlay zone, or a defined Military Influence Area. A5.3.1.3.  The IEMT reviews requests for exemptions for updating the AICUZ study and forwards  the  request    to  the  MAJCOM  EMT  who  either  approves  or  disapproves  the exemption  to  the  AICUZ  study  update.  The  MAJCOM  informs  AFCEC/CPPR  of  the decision and supplies the related documentation. A5.3.2.  In cases where exemptions to the release of an AICUZ study are granted, the current noise zone map is provided to the local governments to be attached  to the existing AICUZ study. A5.3.3.  Installations  with  an  exemption  for  updating  the  AICUZ  study  forward  the  most current AICUZ map to the lead planning agency and specific federal agencies (FAA, HUD, VA, and Farmers Home Administration). A5.3.4.  An  exemption  from  updating  the  AICUZ  study  should  not  be  interpreted  to  mean that the installation no longer has to participate in local planning efforts  or are exempt from other  AICUZ  program  requirements.    The  biennially  evaluation  of  aircraft  operations  and monitoring  of  other  changes  to  mission  operations  that  could  create  non-noise  related compatibility  issues  needs  to  continue.    Monitoring  local  community  land  use  planning activities  and  to  identify  proposed  changes  that  would  essentially  reverse  the  previous adoption of AICUZ recommendations in  local  zoning  and land use controls  remains vitally important.
