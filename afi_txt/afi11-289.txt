This instruction applies to all organizations and aircrews who are responsible for the  operation  and  support  of  airlift  aircraft  flying  missions  in  support  of  presidential requirements. Commanders at all levels must ensure their units are fully aware of the importance and  sensitivity  of  these  missions.  The  guidance  in  this  publication  takes  precedence  over  any conflicting guidance issued by field units. (T-1) 1.2.  Deviations and Waivers.  The HQ AMC Operations Management Division (AMC/A3O) is OPR  for  this  instruction.  Unless  otherwise  specified  in  cited  source  references,  HQ  AMC Director  of  Operations  (AMC/A3)  is  waiver  authority.  Submit  requests  to  deviate  from  the guidance in this instruction, or for specific waivers to operational procedures, to HQ AMC/A3O for  disposition.  HQ  AMC  Standardization/Evaluation  Division  (AMC/A3V)  is  the  point  of contact  (POC)  for  waivers  to  operational  procedures.  Aircrews  should  contact  618th  Air  and Space  Operations,  Tanker  Airlift  Control  Center,  Current  Operations  Directorate  (618  AOC [TACC]/XOO)  through  the  Global  Operations  Division  (618  AOC  [TACC]/XOCG)  to  request deviations.  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOO  will  forward  such  requests  to  AMC/A3O.  Non-AMC aircrews will request authorization to deviate from this instruction through their normal chains of command  to  their  controlling  MAJCOM  Mobility  Airlift  command  and  control  (C2)  Facility (Para. 1.6.9) which, in turn, will forward the requests to 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG. Requests for waivers to aircraft operating procedures will be through normal methods established IAW MDS guidance.  When  extraordinary  conditions  arise  with  such  short  notice  as  to  preclude  prior approval  for  deviations  or  waivers,  the  aircraft  commander  (A/C)  may  exercise  command authority  to  deviate  from  this  instruction.  In  all  such  cases,  aircraft  commanders  will  furnish  a written explanation to their commanders within 24 hours, providing copies through channels to 618 AOC (TACC)/XOO and HQ AMC/A3O. 1.3.  Distribution.  MAJCOMs will establish a control system for distributing this regulation and changes.  Unit  commanders  will  provide  copies  of  this  instruction  for  all  aircrew  members  and associated support personnel.  (T-3) 1.3.1.  One copy of this instruction will be maintained in each C-130, C-5, C-17 and KC-10 Electronic Flight Bag (EFB).  (T-3) 1.3.2.

Forward  a  copy  of  all  published  supplements  or  chapters  to  the OPR,  AMC/A3O,  and  to  WHMO.  Supplements  and  local  procedures  will  not  duplicate,  alter, amend,  or  be  less  restrictive  than  the  provisions  of  this  basic  AFI  or  of  flight  manual publications. 1.5.  Operations Security (OPSEC).  The responsibility for OPSEC associated with PHOENIX BANNER,  SILVER,  and  COPPER  missions  rests  with  all  personnel  involved.  Limit  the dissemination  of  pertinent  information  to  those  having  operational  and  or  leadership responsibilities.  In  reference  to  these  missions,  and  particularly  to  the  travel  of  Distinguished Visitor (DV)s on these missions, do not use the terminology “Phoenix Banner,” “Phoenix Silver” or “Phoenix Copper” when using non-secure transmission modes (radio, telephone, e-mail, FAX, fiber optics, etc.);  rather, use the Global  Decision Support  System (GDSS) mission numbers to identify  these  missions.    Do  not  associate  the  names,  duty  titles  or  ranks  of  the  DVs  traveling with any mission details unless using secure communications. Ensure all actions relevant to this regulation comply with the guidance in AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC). 1.6.  Terminology. 1.6.1.  Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM). A SAAM is operated (other than by the 89th  Airlift  Wing)  to  satisfy  a  requirement  to  pick  up  or  deliver  cargo  and/or  personnel  at locations  other  than  those  established  within  the  normal  channel  structure.  It  is  a  mission needing special consideration because of the number of passengers, weight of the cargo, size of the cargo, urgency, sensitivity of movement, or other special factors. 1.6.2.  PHOENIX BANNER.  A SAAM supporting the President of the United States. 1.6.3.  PHOENIX SILVER.  A SAAM supporting the Vice President of the United States. 1.6.4.  PHOENIX COPPER.

Aircraft and aircrew capable of entering crew rest within 2 hours after notification and becoming legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. C-130  aircraft  and  aircrew  will  be  capable  of  departing  a  maximum  of  17+15  hours  after entering crew rest. C-17 aircraft and aircrew will be capable of departing a maximum of 17+45 hours after entering crew rest.  KC-10 and C-5 aircraft and aircrew will be capable of departing a maximum of 18+15 hours after entering crew rest. Aircrews may then be placed in ALFA, BRAVO, or tasked to fly. 1.6.6.  Load  Time.  The  time  established  by  WHMO  Airlift  Operations  and  PHOENIX BANNER,  SILVER  and  COPPER  users  as  the  time  aircraft  doors  are  open  and  aircrew  is   6  AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015 ready  to  load  cargo  or  equipment.  All  servicing  activities  should  be  accomplished  prior  to this time.  EXCEPTION:  When loading a HMX-1 VH-3D helicopter on a C-17, accomplish aircraft refueling  after loading due to  possible  clearance issues with  less  than full stabilizer strut extension. 1.6.7.  Common Users of This  Mission. The single POC for each of these users on  a  given flight is referred to as the troop commander. 1.6.7.1.  United States Secret Service (USSS). 1.6.7.2.  White House Communications Agency (WHCA). 1.6.7.3.  Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1). 1.6.7.4.  White House Support Missions (WHSM). 1.6.7.5.  Presidential Airlift Group (PAG). 1.6.8.  Banner  Express.  This  expression  refers  to  the  deployment  of  aircraft,  aircrews, maintenance  personnel,  support  equipment,  and  a  command  element  to  sustain  the anticipated  high  operations  tempo  of  PHOENIX  BANNER/SILVER  operations  within  the continental United States (CONUS) during an election season. 1.6.9.  MAJCOM Mobility Airlift C2 Facility. This generic expression identifies C2 facilities or  organizations  within  an  AOC  which  provide  command  and  control  over  mobility  airlift missions.  The  following  organizations  are  examples:  Force  Projection  Operations  Center (FPOC) within United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Air Mobility Division (AMD) within  Pacific  Air  Forces  (PACAF)  or  US  Air  Forces  Central  Command  (AFCENT),  618 AOC (TACC) within AMC. 1.7.  Airlift Priority.  Department of Defense (DoD) Transportation Movement Priority System (DTMPS). 1.7.1.  DTMPS  priority  1A1  applies  to  PHOENIX  BANNER  and  PHOENIX  SILVER missions. 1.7.2.  DTMPS priority 1B1 applies to PHOENIX COPPER missions. 1.8.  Mission  Tasking  Authority.  WHMO  Airlift  Operations  validates  PHOENIX  BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER missions and assigns SAAM numbers. 1.8.1.  C-130, C-5, C-17 and KC-10 Tasking: 1.8.1.1.  During  Normal  Duty  Hours. WHMO Airlift Operations validates SAAM  airlift requests  to  United  States  Transportation  Command  (USTRANSCOM)  Operations Directorate  (TCJ3).  The  TCJ3  forwards  validated  requests through  618  AOC (TACC)/XOO  to  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOB  Mobility  Management  Directorate,  who  will task the appropriate airlift wing via telephone, facsimile or other electronic means. 1.8.1.2.  Other  Than  Normal  Duty  Hours.  WHMO  Airlift  Operations  validates  SAAM airlift requests to TCJ3 through 618 AOC (TACC). TCJ3 passes validated requests to 618 AOC  (TACC)/XOB  through  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOO  and  informs  the  618  AOC (TACC)/XOZ,  Director  of  Operations,  and  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOC,  Command  and Control  Directorate,  of  the  new  taskings.  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOB,  through  618  AOC AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015   7  (TACC)/XOC,  then  tasks  the  appropriate  airlift  wing/group  through  the  Operations Support Squadron (OSS) or command post. to  TCJ3,  who  passes  validated  requests 1.8.2.  Tasking Non-AMC Assets (PACAF / USAFE / AFCENT). WHMO Airlift Operations validates  SAAM  requests to  618  AOC (TACC)/XOO.  For  US  Pacific  Command  (PACOM),  US  European  Command  (EUCOM) and  US  Central  Command  (CENTCOM)  theaters,  the  TCJ3  should  contact  the  respective Joint  Movement  Center  (JMC).  The  JMC  then  directs  the  appropriate  theater  or  MAJCOM Mobility Airlift C2 Facility to contact 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOO, Special Assignment Airlift Mission Division, to coordinate mission details.   8  AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 AIRCREW PROCEDURES 2.1.  Aircrew  Mission  Procedures.  GDSS  provides  detailed  mission  tasking  information. Unless GDSS calls for an augmented aircrew, units will plan on using a basic aircrew with three loadmasters  on  C-5  aircraft,  two  loadmasters  on  C-17  aircraft,  and  one  loadmaster  on  C-130 aircraft (two loadmasters or one loadmaster and another qualified aircrew member are required if more  than  40  passengers  are  carried  on  a  C-130).  On  KC-10  aircraft,  the  basic  aircrew  will include  an  extra  boom  operator  if  cargo  operations  are  required,  or  an  extra  boom  operator qualified  to  handle  passengers  (or  an  extra  aircrew  member  knowledgeable  in  passenger procedures) when more than 40 total people are on board. Outside the continental United States (OCONUS) missions will normally be tasked as an augmented aircrew. (T-2) 2.1.1.  HHQ  evaluations  on  PHOENIX  support  missions  are  authorized.    Evaluators  should contact 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD, Executive Airlift Mission Branch prior to evaluation for any  mission  related  details.    Evaluators  should  use  discretion,  and  consider  the  sensitive nature  and  logistical  ramifications,  if  necessary,  to  conduct  evaluations  on  PHOENIX support  missions  IAW  AFI  11-202V2_AMCSUP_1,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation Program,  paragraph  4.3.7.1.      Evaluators  must  be  fully  current  and  qualified  within  their weapons system/aircrew specialty.  If warranted, the evaluator will be prepared to assume the duties of the evaluated crew member for the remainder of the mission leg.  The evaluator will be prepared to continue follow-on missions if directed by the execution authority. (T-1) 2.1.2.  Aircrew  Selection.  Squadron  commanders  and  operations  officers  will  ensure  that aircrew members chosen for these missions are certified IAW para 2.1.3., and highly capable. Selection  should  be  based  on  qualification,  proficiency,  experience,  maturity,  and  mission complexity.  As  a  minimum,  the  aircrew  must  be  qualified  and  current  to  fly  the  aircraft’s lowest  certified  instrument  approach  minimums  capability  (i.e.,  AFI  11-2C-17,  V3,  C-17 Operations Procedures, Para 6.42.6.1). (T-1) 2.1.2.1.  Aircraft  Commanders.  Squadron  commanders  will  select the  aircraft commanders  to  command  PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER,  or  COPPER  missions  from among  their most qualified aircraft commanders.  Selection is  a judgment  call, based on the overall performance of candidate A/Cs and on their experience level since upgrade to A/C.    The  aircraft  commander  must  have  logged  at  least  100  hours  in  command  since A/C  certification.  (T-1)  Note:    Aircraft  commanders  will  review  the  mission  CONOPS prior to mission execution. (T-2) 2.1.3.  Aircrew  Certification.  All  aircrew  members  will  complete  the  following  training program  and be  certified prior to  flying unsupervised on a PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER, or COPPER mission. Training will focus on the unique circumstances that differentiate this mission  from  other  missions.  Aircrew  members  may  enter  PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER, or  COPPER  mission  training  once  they  begin  mission  qualification  training  (airland  only). Wings  will  establish  and  maintain  PHOENIX  BANNER  training  programs.  (T-2)  As  a minimum, the training program will consist of: 2.1.3.1.  An  in-depth  instructor-led  review  of  this  instruction,  including  a  discussion  of tasking  and  execution agencies  for PHOENIX BANNER missions and how the  aircrew AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015   9  will  interface  with  these  agencies.  It  must  also  include  a  discussion  of  POCs  that  the aircrew will have to coordinate with in case of diversion or delay, including the Air Force Advance Agent and the troop commander from the USSS, WHCA, HMX-1, and WHSM. The  goal  is  to  educate  aircrew  members  on  the  interface  required  between  aircrew members and the users.  (T-2) 2.1.3.2.  An open book examination of material covered in AFI 11-289, minimum passing score of 80 percent, corrected to 100 percent.  (T-2) 2.1.3.3.  A memorandum of certification signed by the squadron commander.  For AMC, annotate  certification  on  AF  FORM  4324,  Aircraft  Assignment/Aircrew  Qualification Worksheet and on the unit's Letter of "X"s.  The Operations Group commander (OG/CC) must the Standardization/Evaluation  (STAN/EVAL)  Board.  For  other  MAJCOMs,  annotate  on training letter of transmittal, Aviation Resource Management System, or AF Information Management Tools (IMT) 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training and file IAW MAJCOM directives.  (T-2) mission-series certifications at review the PHOENIX 2.1.4.  Briefings. The operating wing’s OSS will brief the aircraft commander on all aspects of  the  mission.  The  aircraft  commander  will  then  brief  the  remainder  of  the  aircrew.  The aircraft commander or a designated aircrew member will then discuss these aspects with the designated troop commander. The troop commander is the single POC representing the user. The aircraft commander will ascertain the identity of the troop commander prior to departure. The briefing will include the following: (T-2) 2.1.4.1.  Mission number and priority. 2.1.4.2.  Airfields to be transited. 2.1.4.3.  Parking locations. 2.1.4.4.  Remain  overnight  (RON)  restrictions.  Fly  mission  as  planned.  To  RON  at  an unplanned stop is problematic and normally will not be approved. 2.1.4.5.  Servicing at civilian airfields. 2.1.4.6.  Load, takeoff and landing times. 2.1.4.7.  Names and telephone numbers of contacts. 2.1.4.8.  Load information, to include cargo description, number of passengers, and name of  highest-ranking  passenger  (DV  code  6  and  Senior  Executive  Service,  level  I  or higher). 2.1.4.9.  Meal requirements. 2.1.4.10.  Security procedures. 2.1.4.11.  Command  and  Control  (C2)  Procedures.  If  the  aircrew  enters  crew  rest,  the aircraft commander will ensure the troop commander is aware of the existing C2 at that location  (local  command  post,  Tanker  Airlift  Control  Element  [TALCE],  618  AOC [TACC],  Passenger  Service,  etc.).  This  is  especially  important  if  there  is  a  chance  that another aircrew will assume the mission. 2.1.4.12.  Overseas intelligence briefing and customs procedures, if applicable.   10  AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015 2.1.4.13.  Diplomatic clearance information. 2.1.4.14.  Aircrew  member  passports,  visa  requirements  (emphasizing  expiration  dates and single-entry verses multiple-entry visas), international certificates of vaccinations and any  other  unique  host  nation  specific  requirements  as  stated  in  the  Foreign  Clearance Guide (FCG). Immediately notify 618 AOC (TACC)/XOB if aircrew member passports or visas will expire during the duration of the trip including up to 14 days afterwards. 2.1.4.15.  Any additional items deemed appropriate. 2.1.4.16.  Mission  directives  (aircraft  commander  should  check  mission  information  in GDSS and other messages pertaining to the mission, when available). 2.1.4.17.  Take-off, en route, and destination weather. 2.1.5.  Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP). 2.1.5.1.  Both  CDT  and  FDP  are  in  accordance  with  the  appropriate  AFI  11-2  MDS-Specific, Volume 3 series. 2.1.5.2.  Normally CDT and FDP begin one hour after alert. EXCEPTIONS: Any time an aircrew member is required to show before the standard aircrew show time, the CDT and FDP start when the aircrew member arrives to perform duties. For ALFA standby, CDT and FDP begin at alert. 2.1.6.  Aircrew  Apparel.  The  aircrew  uniform  is  the  only  uniform  normally  required  on PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER,  or  COPPER  missions.  Civilian  attire  may  be  required  at some  overseas  locations  when  directed  by  the  FCG  or  as  directed  in  other  mission-specific directives. 2.2.  Mission Trip Kits.  The trip kit will include, as a minimum, the following: (T-2) 2.2.1.  A copy of this instruction, unless a copy is available through the aircraft commander’s EFB. 2.2.2.  Sufficient copies of AF IMT 15, United States Air Force Invoice. 2.2.3.  Sufficient copies of Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher. 2.2.4.  Appropriate customs clearance forms for the aircrew and passengers. 2.2.5.  A copy of the unclassified sections of the DoD FCG for missions transiting overseas locations, if not already located with the Flight Information Publications. 2.3.  Aircrew  Command  and  Control  (C2).  Aircrews  and  controllers  will  follow  C2 procedures  as  outlined  in  para  4.2.  For  aircrews  on  AMC-tasked  missions,  “C2”  refers  to  618 AOC (TACC). For aircrews on missions tasked by USAFE, C2 refers to FPOC. For PACAF- or AFCENT-tasked  missions,  C2  refers  to  AMD.  Aircrews  will  forward  mission  problems  to  618 AOC (TACC), the FPOC or AMD, as appropriate. (T-2) 2.4.  Contacts.  The  primary  POC  for  PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER,  or  COPPER  mission planning  is  WHMO  Airlift  Operations.  The  primary  POC  for  aircrews  is  618  AOC (TACC)/XOCG,  the  theater  FPOC  or  AMD,  as  appropriate.  The  89th  Aerial  Port  Squadron (APS) is  the single POC for aerial  port issues on PHOENIX  BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER missions  which  originate  or  transit  Joint  Base  Andrews.  Normally,  at  all  offload  stations  for AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015   11  PHOENIX  BANNER  missions;  an  Air  Force  Advance  Agent  represents  WHMO.  If  time permits,  WHMO  provides  the  name  of  its  POC  and  Advance  Agent  to  618  AOC (TACC)/XOOO,  who  sends  the  information  in  the  GDSS.  If  present,  the  Air  Force  Advance Agent  will  meet  the  aircraft  upon  arrival.  The  aircraft  commander  will  provide  the  Air  Force Advance  Agent  with  instructions  for  reaching  the  aircrew  during  overnight  stays  (to  include  a telephone  number);  in  turn,  the  Advance  Agent  provides  a  telephone  number  to  the  aircraft commander  where  the  agent  can  be  reached.  The  Advance  Agent  will  not  violate  the  aircraft commander’s crew rest. The aircraft commander will inform the Advance Agent and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG (or the appropriate theater FPOC or AMD) of any maintenance problems, load problems, or schedule changes. 2.5.  Ground  Times,  Early  Arrivals  and  Departures.  At  on  load  and  offload  stations,  the planned ground times for PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER missions are 2+15 hours for the C-130 aircraft, 2+45 hours for the C-17, and 3+45 hours for the C-5 and the KC-10. At en route  stations  without  cargo  on  load  or  offload,  planned  ground  times  for  these  missions  are 2+00  hours  for  the  C-130,  1+45  hours  for  the  C-17,  and  2+45  hours  for  the  C-5  and  KC-10. WHMO  may  request  shorter  ground  times  consistent  with  mission  requirements  and  safety considerations.  Aircrews  may  request  early  departure  if  all  cargo  and  passengers  are  loaded. With C2 concurrence, WHMO must authorize all early arrivals and early departures greater than 1+15.   The 618 AOC (TACC)/XOC SAAM Duty Officer can approve early departures less than 1+15.  For  OCONUS,  diplomatic  clearance  validity  must  be  considered  prior  to  requesting  or authorizing early departures and arrivals (many diplomatic clearances do not allow early arrival). 2.6.  Diplomatic  Clearances.  Required  clearances  normally  will  be  obtained  before  home station departure. In some instances, this may not be possible and special assistance by the State Department may be required. Aircraft commanders will become familiar with the provisions of Section III of the DoD FCG and their in-flight responsibilities for all countries to be over flown or  transited.  Aircraft  commanders  must  ensure  proper  clearances  have  been  received  before entering  foreign  airspace.  When  in-flight  deviations  are  required  due  to  emergencies  or  other contingencies,  contact  the  appropriate  C2  for  assistance.  Aircraft  commanders  will  keep  the appropriate C2 informed of all actions taken or any assistance required. (T-1) 2.7.  Aircraft  Configuration.  Configure  PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER,  and  COPPER missions  according  to  the  GDSS.  Chocks  and  ground  wires  will  be  on  board.  C-130  missions will have a cargo ramp support (milk stool) and operational cargo winch on board. 89 APS will coordinate the exact quantities of 463L equipment needed. (T-1) 2.8.  Passenger Requirements. 2.8.1.  In-flight Feeding. 2.8.1.1.  MAJCOM/A3  may  authorize  the  dispensing  of  alcoholic  beverages  on PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER,  or  COPPER  missions  according  to  AFI  34-219, Alcoholic Beverage Program. 2.8.1.2.  Hot  meals  will  not  be  available  unless  USAF  In-flight  Passenger  Service Specialists (Flight Attendants) are onboard and meal service has been pre-coordinated. 2.8.1.3.  WHMO  Airlift  Operations  coordinates  the  number  and  type  of  meals  with USTRANSCOM.  The  meal  request  is  added  to  the  GDSS.  Meals  are  requested  for departures  from  Regular  Air  Force  (RegAF)  Installations  when  legs  are  four  hours  or   12  AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015 more.  At  stations  other  than  RegAF  Installations,  users  are  responsible  for  in-flight meals. 2.8.1.3.1.  89 APS will deliver meals to the aircraft for missions departing Joint Base Andrews. 2.8.1.3.2.  Do not over pack frozen or boxed meals. Meals Ready to Eat (MRE) may be over packed, if requested by the user through WHMO. 2.8.1.3.3.  IAW  AFMAN  34-240,  Food  Service  Program  Management,  in-flight kitchens  issue  meals  on  a  credit  basis.  The  senior  passenger  representative(s)  will collect meal money from all passengers and will turn the money over to the aircraft loadmaster for turn-in at the next station's in-flight kitchen or to their home station in-flight kitchen office upon mission termination. 2.8.1.4.  IAW AFMAN 34-240, the in-flight kitchen will provide snacks, free of charge to passengers, using the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) for departures from RegAF  Installations. 2.8.2.  Ground Requirements. 2.8.2.1.  At  en  route  stops,  the  aircrew  is  not  responsible  for  special  requests  of passengers  unless  directly  related  to  the  operation  of  the  aircraft  or  the  mission  (as determined by the aircraft commander). 2.8.2.2.  Individual  passengers  are  responsible  for  ensuring  their  baggage  is  on  the aircraft. 2.8.2.3.  Staircase Truck Operations for Presidential Aircraft. 2.8.2.3.1.  The  Presidential  Airlift  Group  Commander  (PAG/CC),  as  the  Mission Execution Authority, will direct staircase truck operations when supporting Air Force One and associated Presidential Aircraft.  This unique direction will include specific instructions  on  the  use  of  staircase  truck  outriggers,  chocking  procedures,  and  the movement  of  the  staircase  truck  to  and  away  from  Air  Force  One,  its  back-up  and any/all  other  designated  Presidential  Aircraft.    Staircase  truck  operators  and  ground personnel will comply with all Presidential Advance Agent procedures and directions. (T-2) 2.8.2.3.2.  This policy only applies to Presidential Airlift Group operations, regardless of type aircraft used. 2.8.3.  Aircraft  Manifesting.  WHMO  is  the  manifesting  authority  for  all  PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER missions. 2.8.3.1.  Space Available and unrelated duty passengers are not authorized on active legs except by very specific exception and approval. Do not manifest, load, or airlift unrelated passengers  or  cargo  unless  specifically  approved  by  the  user  and  618  AOC (TACC)/XOOO (or the MAJCOM Mobility Airlift C2 Facility), who will coordinate with WHMO. Space Available passengers are allowed on positioning and depositioning legs. EXCEPTION: Space Available passengers are not allowed on aircraft positioning from or depositioning to Marine Corps Base Quantico (KNYG). 2.8.4.  Passenger Access and Seating. AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015   13  2.8.4.1.  C-5  Courier  Compartment  Access.  WHMO  will  coordinate  through  618  AOC (TACC)/XOOO  and  the  requirements  will  be  published  in  the  GDSS.  Aircrews  should anticipate the use of the Courier Compartment on all PHOENIX BANNER or PHOENIX SILVER missions. The following restrictions apply: 2.8.4.1.1.  Courier  Compartment  seating  is  limited  to  six  seats.  One  of  the  six  seats will  be  reserved  for  the  HMX-1  Security  Guard  who  will  accompany  all  USAF aircrew members who require access to the cargo area when HMX-1 helicopters are carried. 2.8.4.1.2.  Normal  access  to  areas  other  than  Courier  Compartment  and  lavatory requires approval of the aircraft commander. 2.8.4.2.  HMX-1 Passengers in the Cargo Area. During the movement of HMX-1 assets, personnel  (including  aircrew)  requiring  access  to  the  cargo  compartment  must  be accompanied  by  HMX-1  security  or  HMX-1  maintenance  personnel.  EXCEPTION: During  emergencies,  aircrew  members  will  be  allowed  access  to  the  C-5  cargo compartment  without  escort.  If  a  problem  exists  with  a  HMX-1  helicopter  or  with  the cargo,  HMX-1  security  or  maintenance  personnel  shall  be  granted  access  to  the  cargo area  accompanied  by  an  aircrew  member.  HMX-1  security  and  maintenance  personnel will  be  briefed  by  an  aircrew  member  on  the  use  of  emergency  equipment  prior  to accompanying aircrew members during in-flight checks in the C-5 cargo compartment. 2.8.4.3.  When a military working dog is carried, the dog handler requires frequent access to the canine to monitor its health and welfare. If the canine is in a non-passenger area, an aircrew member will escort the dog handler. 2.9.  Waivers.  The  following  standing  waivers  are  applicable  to  PHOENIX  BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER missions only. 2.9.1.  USSS,  and  HMX-1/Senior  Executive  Service  (SENEX)  security  personnel  are authorized to carry weapons and ammunition on active legs of SAAMs,   IAW paragraph 5, of  the  Defense  Transportation  Regulation  (DTR),  Part  III,  Appendix  BB,  Procedures  for Transporting  Weapons,  Ammunition,  and  Hazardous  Materials  (HAZMAT)  Aboard Commercial  Aircraft  in  Scheduled  Service  and  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)-Owned  or Controlled Aircraft.  Additionally, these personnel may place unloaded weapons in vehicles or  cargo  onboard  the  aircraft  when  escorting  their  equipment  on  PHOENIX  BANNER, SILVER and COPPER missions. 2.9.1.1.  USSS  agents'  badges  and  photo  identification  serve  as  their  authorization  to carry  weapons  onboard  DoD-owned  and/or  controlled  aircraft.    HMX-1/SENEX personnel must have a statement in their trip roster, manifest, or orders authorizing them to be armed while in the performance of their duties. 2.9.1.2.  These  authorized  individuals  may  carry  up  to  three  (3)  clips  of  ammunition  on their person and up to three (3) additional clips of ammunition in their checked baggage and do not require HAZMAT packaging and certification. 2.9.2.  Helicopters, vehicles and support equipment under direct control and escort of USSS, WHCA, HMX-1, WHSM and PAG may be transported without hazardous materials shipper   14  AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015 certification, packing lists, load lists, placards and markings (Center of Balance (C/B), Front Axle Weight (FAW), etc.). 2.9.2.1.  All helicopters, vehicles and support equipment will be prepared for air shipment according  to  AFMAN  24-204,  Preparing  Hazardous  Materials  for  Military  Air Shipments. Aircrew will inspect  the cargo to  verify proper preparation for air shipment. The user will correct deficiencies before loading cargo. (T-1) 2.9.2.2.  The standing waivers of para 2.9. do not apply to personnel and equipment (e.g., TALCE,  Mission  Support  Team,  Maintenance  Recovery  Team)  deploying  to  support PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER and COPPER missions. 2.9.2.3.  Users  will  validate  the  weights  and  dimensions  of  cargo  on  their  load  plans  to ensure  aircrews  have  accurate  data  for  computing  the  aircraft  weight  and  balance.    All cargo  will  be  weighed  prior  to  upload  and  the  data  provided  to  the  aircrew.    For  initial departure,  an  accurate  load  plan  from  the  89  APS  will  suffice  for  valid  weight  and dimension  data.    En  route,  users  will  weigh  all  cargo  prior  to  upload  and  the  new  data will be provided to the aircrew. 2.9.3.  Escorts will brief the aircraft commander or designated representative on all hazardous material being transported.  The briefing will include all items required by AFMAN 24-204 IP, Attachment 21. The aircraft commander will ensure escorts or their designee has received the necessary briefing before departure.  (T-1) AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015   15  Chapter 3 AREA STANDBY FORCE AND BACKUP AIRCRAFT POLICIES 3.1.  Area Standby Force. 3.1.1.  General: 3.1.1.1.  To support short-notice PHOENIX BANNER and PHOENIX SILVER missions, AMC  maintains  one  C-17  aircraft  and  one  C-17  augmented  aircrew  in  continuous BRAVO alert at a CONUS location determined by 618 AOC (TACC)/XOB. Changes to the  aircrew  complement  or  alert  status,  regardless  of  duration,  must  be  approved  by WHMO. (T-0) 3.1.1.2.  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOB,  the  MAJCOM  Mobility  Airlift  C2  Facility,  as appropriate,  will  task  specific  BRAVO  or  ALFA  area  standby  aircraft  and  crews  to support scheduled PHOENIX BANNER and PHOENIX SILVER missions. Authority to release the area standby resides with 618 AOC (TACC)/XOZ or the MAJCOM Mobility Airlift C2 Facility, as appropriate. Coordination with the 618 AOC (TACC)/XOB Barrel is strongly encouraged. 3.1.1.3.  Unplanned  changes  to  the  PHOENIX  BANNER  and  PHOENIX  SILVER  alert posture  must  be  coordinated  with  WHMO.  WHMO  area  standby  requirements  are  in addition  to  other  AMC  requirements.  Non-AMC  controlled  area  standby  requirements will be tasked by the MAJCOM Mobility Airlift C2 Facility, as appropriate. 3.1.2.  Aircraft  configuration.  Chocks,  ground  wires,  milk  stool  and  operational  winch  (as applicable) are required for all standby aircraft. 3.1.2.1.  Standby  C-130  aircraft  will  be  configured  C-1  according  to  AFI  11-2C-130, Volume  3,  C-130  Operations  Procedures,  ADDENDA  A,  unless  otherwise  directed  by WHMO through TACC Combat Delivery Division (618 AOC (TACC)/XOBC). 3.1.2.2.  Standby C-5 aircraft will be configured CP-2 according to AFI 11-2C-5, Volume 3,  C-5  Operations  Procedures,  ADDENDA  A,  unless  otherwise  directed  by  WHMO through TACC Airlift Allocation Division (618 AOC (TACC)/XOBA). 3.1.2.3.  Standby  C-17  aircraft  will  be  configured  C-2  according  to  AFI  11-2C-17, Volume  3,  C-17  Operations  Procedures,  ADDENDA  A,  unless  otherwise  directed  by WHMO through 618 AOC (TACC)/XOBA. 3.1.2.4.  Standby KC-10 aircraft will be prepared with a “B” configuration IAW AFI 11-2KC-10,  Volume  3,  KC-10  Operations  Procedures,  ADDENDA  A,  unless  otherwise directed by WHMO through the Tanker Allocation Division (618 AOC (TACC)/XOBK). 3.1.3.  Status. Area standby forces are normally in BRAVO status. This may be upgraded to ALFA  alert  status  by  618  AOC  (TACC)  on  a  case-by-case  basis  after  consultation  with WHMO.  618 AOC (TACC) may direct an additional augmented aircrew in CHARLIE status to facilitate area standby force reconstitution. Area standby aircraft in BRAVO status may be used for local training sorties so long as they remain in radio contact with local C2 and are capable  of  being  on  the  ground  at  the  alert  location  within  one  hour  of  being  recalled.  If  a maintenance discrepancy is  discovered that  would prevent  the  aircraft from  being  launched   16  AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015 on  a  mission,  terminate  the  local  training  and  have  the  necessary  maintenance  performed before accomplishing further training. 3.1.4.  Mission  Validation.  Validated  WHMO  requirements  will  normally  be  filled  using home station launches. If there is insufficient lead time, the area standby alert force will be used with WHMO Airlift Operations approval. The area standby force will be reconstituted IAW  para  3.1.5.  WHMO  will  confirm  the  tasking  and  launch  approval  with  618  AOC (TACC)/XOZ (EXCEPTION: Banner Express). 3.1.5.  Reconstitution. Area standby force reconstitution process begins when notification is received that the area standby force will be launched. Reconstituted area standby forces must be legal for alert NLT 14 hours from the time of notification.  618 AOC (TACC)/XOB will notify WHMO through normal channels when the reconstituted forces will be legal for alert. Area standby forces may be used to support other short-notice requirements with concurrence of WHMO. They will be launched from BRAVO alert to support the new mission. 3.1.6.  Alternate  Standby  Force  Tasking.  When  adverse  weather  conditions  are  forecast  to impact the primary standby alert force, 618 AOC (TACC) will establish an alternate standby force  at  a  location  with  more  favorable  weather  to  ensure  uninterrupted  coverage.  WHMO will be advised of the standby force alternate location and when the standby force has been reconstituted at the original location. 3.2.  Backup Aircraft Policies. 3.2.1.  Backup  Aircraft.  All  missions  requiring  backup  IAW  paras  3.2.1.1,  3.2.1.2,  and 3.2.1.3  will  be  backed  up  with  like  MDS,  or  larger  aircraft,  if  required  by  the  individual dimensions  or  weights  of  the  cargo.  If  the  load  can  be  moved  on  a  combination  of  aircraft smaller  than  the  primary  aircraft,  the  backup  can  be  accommodated  with  one  or  more dissimilar  aircraft  with  the  approval  of  WHMO.  Backup  aircraft,  or  substitute,  will  be configured to support the load requirements. 3.2.1.1.  PHOENIX  BANNER  Backup.  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOB  will  establish  at  least one aircraft and aircrew in BRAVO status to cover PHOENIX BANNER active mission segments (CONUS and OCONUS). The aircrew complement (basic vs. augmented) will be sufficient to operate the mission if the primary aircrew cannot. This may be upgraded to  ALFA  status  by  618  AOC  (TACC)  on  a  case-by-case  basis  after  consultation  with WHMO. The BRAVO alert aircraft and aircrew will be legal for alert no later than one hour  prior  to  the  scheduled  departure  time  for  active  mission  segments.  The  MAJCOM Mobility  Airlift  C2  Facility  will  establish  at  least  one  aircraft  and  aircrew  in  BRAVO status  when  a  theater-tasked  PHOENIX  BANNER  or  SILVER  mission  is  on  active mission segments. 3.2.1.2.  PHOENIX  SILVER  Backup.  CONUS  PHOENIX  SILVER  missions  do  not normally  require  a  backup  aircraft.  PHOENIX  SILVER  missions  tasked  to  OCONUS locations  require  backup  aircraft  to  include  the  departure  from  the  CONUS  on  load locations. Backup procedures to OCONUS PHOENIX SILVER are the same as those for PHOENIX BANNER missions in para 3.2.1.1, above. 3.2.1.3.  PHOENIX  COPPER  Backup.  PHOENIX  COPPER  missions  do  not  require  a backup aircraft unless specifically tasked by WHMO and 618 AOC  (TACC) (or theater FPOC or AMD, as appropriate). AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015   17  3.2.2.  Home  Station  Departures.  No  AMC-directed  requirement  exists  for  dedicated  spare aircraft for PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER missions departing home station. BRAVO alert or in-system-select aircraft will fulfill backup requirements. Unit commanders may dedicate a mission spare from their Wing Aircraft Allocation at their discretion. 3.3.  En Route “In-System Select” Aircrew and Aircraft Requirements. 3.3.1.  For an aircrew to be considered qualified to operate a PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or  COPPER  mission,  only  the  aircraft  commander  and  one  loadmaster/boom  operator  must meet  the  selection  and  certification  criteria  in  paras  2.1.1  and  2.1.2  of  this  regulation.  In-system  select  aircraft  may  be  Partially  Mission  Capable  (PMC)  as  long  as  the  selected aircraft can meet the requirements of the mission being operated.   18  AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015 Chapter 4 SECURITY AND COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) 4.1.  Aircraft  Security.  Security  procedures  prescribed  in  appropriate  MAJCOM  security regulations apply to PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER missions. 4.1.1.  For  PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER,  or  COPPER  missions  operating  into  foreign airfields,  618  AOC  (TACC)/XOO  will  inform  HQ  AMC  Installation  &  Mission  Support Directorate, Security Forces Division (AMC/A7S) as far in advance as practical. AMC/A7S will conduct the airfield security assessments, to include host nation security capability, and apprise  HQ  AMC  Threat  Working  Group  (AMC/TWG)  of  assessment  results.  If  security vulnerabilities  exist  and  host  nation  support  is  inadequate,  or  unavailable,  AMC/A7S  will assign  available  PHOENIX  RAVEN  personnel  to  the  mission  and  advise  both  HQ  AMC TWG and WHMO of the requirement. 4.1.2.  For  PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER,  or  COPPER  missions  operating  into  foreign locations, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOO will inform HQ AMC Intelligence Directorate (AMC/A2) as  far  in  advance  as  practical,  providing  the  planned  flight  itineraries.  HQ  AMC  Force Protection Intelligence Analysis &  Integration Division (AMC/A2A) will assess the current threat  of  such  operations,  apprising  HQ  AMC  TWG  of  results.  HQ  AMC  Force  Protection Intelligence Operations & Applications Division (AMC/A2O) will use the planned itineraries to provide “24/7” intelligence flight following for the 618 AOC (TACC). 4.1.3.  The  aircraft  commander  will  ensure  all  security  force  personnel  tasked  to  support  a PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER mission receive the applicable briefings. (T-2) 4.2.  Command and Control (C2). 4.2.1.  PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER missions are of high level interest and must get special attention in accordance with established CLOSE WATCH procedures. Any problems  that  affect  the  mission  will  be  immediately  brought  to  the  attention  of  618  AOC (TACC)  for  AMC-controlled  assets  or  theater  FPOC  or  AMD,  as  appropriate,  for  theater-controlled  assets.  The  senior  controller/director  will  take  the  necessary  action  to  ensure  the mission operates on schedule. 4.2.2.  Command: 4.2.2.1.  AMC  tasked  missions.  The  Commander,  AMC,  retains  operational  control  of PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER aircraft and aircrews. Control is exercised through 618 AOC (TACC) and the en route FPOC or AMD, as appropriate. For theater-tasked missions, the theater MAJCOM commander retains  operational  control, which is exercised through the FPOC or AMD.  618 AOC (TACC), or the theater FPOC or AMD, will  update  all  applicable  MAJCOMs  on  the  status,  changes,  or  requirements.  For missions  when  cargo  transitions  from  the  TACC  to  theater  FPOC  or  AMD-controlled assets,  618  AOC  (TACC)  will  fully  coordinate  all  mission  details  with  the  appropriate FPOC  or  AMD  to  ensure  precise  details  are  passed,  agreed  upon,  and  coordinated.  For missions where cargo transitions from the theater FPOC or AMD to 618 AOC (TACC), the theater FPOC or AMD, as appropriate, will initiate the communication for the above compliance. AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015   19  4.2.2.2.  AMC tasked crews will use mobility air forces C2 to contact 618 AOC (TACC) to  the  maximum  extent  possible.  Theater  tasked  crews  will  use  the  FPOC  or  AMD  C2 system to the maximum extent possible. Aircrews will forward mission problems to 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG or to the theater FPOC or AMD, as appropriate. (T-2) 4.2.2.3.  When AMC bases are transited, normal C2 reporting procedures apply. At non-AMC  stations,  aircraft  commanders  will  report  all  arrivals  and  departures  to  618  AOC (TACC)/XOCG  by  any  means  necessary,  including  high  frequency  radio,  High Frequency-Automatic Link Establishment, L-Band Satellite Communication, commercial telephone  or  through  Flight  Service  Stations.  Non-AMC  controlled  units  should  ensure their report is received by their theater FPOC or AMD, as appropriate. 4.2.2.4.  When  an  aircraft  departs  during  non-duty  hours,  the  C2  agency  updates  the GDSS database and notifies all concerned stations. 4.2.2.5.  The  appropriate  C2  agency  (618  AOC  (TACC)/XOCG  or  theater  FPOC  or AMD)  must  relay  to  WHMO  Airlift  Operations  any  mission  delays  and  problems  that will affect any active legs. Aircrews should not normally contact WHMO directly. 4.2.2.6.  WHMO  Airlift  Operations  is  the  sole  validation  authority  for  changes  to PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER,  or  COPPER  missions.  Air  Force  Advance  Agents  and the  user  (USSS,  WHCA,  and  HMX-1)  do  not  have  the  authority  to  alter  scheduled missions. If the aircraft commander is approached with a proposed change, the A/C will refer the requesting party to their operations section or to WHMO Airlift Operations. (T-0) 4.2.3.  Communications: 4.2.3.1.  Along  with  normal  airborne  reporting,  remarks  should  include  any  special requirements, such as fuel, transportation, parking, security and in-flight meals. 4.2.3.2.  Aircrews  have  limited  access  to  WHCA  facilities  and  will  use  existing commercial, DSN and radio equipment for routine communications. As a last alternative, an  aircrew  requiring  WHCA  assistance  should  contact  the  WHCA  Trip  Officer  or  Air Force Advance Agent. 4.2.3.3.  For  C-130  support  to  HMX-1  on  CONUS  cross-country  helicopter  ferry missions,  contact  the  HMX-1  Operations  Duty  Officer  for  a  briefing  upon  arrival  at Marine  Corps  Base  Quantico.  This  briefing  will  include  primary  point  of  contact, helicopter call sign, planned route of flight (to include diverts) and frequencies. The call sign  and  frequencies  are  necessary  for  in-flight  communication  with  the  ferrying helicopter. Planners will ensure that the  airfields are at  least  suitable for  C-130 aircraft. HMX-1  Operations  phone  number  is  DSN  278-2760/2209  or  Commercial  (703)  784-2760/2209.   20  AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015 Chapter 5 LOGISTICS PROCEDURES 5.1.  General.  This  chapter  provides  guidelines  for  aircraft  selection  and  preparation  for PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER missions. It applies to all maintenance personnel who  support  or  conduct  these  support  airlift  missions.  The  most  highly  qualified  technicians available should do all inspections, repairs, and verifications. 5.2.  Aircraft  Selection  and  Preparation.  Aircraft  are  selected  like  all  high  priority  SAAM missions to meet the highest standards of reliability and must not have an uncorrected history of repeat or recurring malfunctions. PMC aircraft may be used as long as the selected aircraft can meet the requirements of the mission being flown. 5.3.  Flying Crew Chiefs.  Units with Flying Crew Chiefs (FCC) will assign them to PHOENIX BANNER,  SILVER,  and  COPPER  missions.  For  OCONUS  PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER, and  COPPER  missions,  one  FCC  and  one  additional  maintenance  mission  essential  personnel (MEP)  are  required  due  to  the  possibility  of  operating  in  unique/austere  locations.    618  AOC (TACC)/XOO in coordination with AMC/A4 may determine a need for additional FCCs.  This requirement will be annotated in GDSS.  The FCC will be responsible for all aircraft inspections, maintenance  and  servicing  after  home  station  departure.  At  en  route  locations,  the  FCC  will normally coordinate, direct, and participate in all maintenance support activities due to mission security  requirements.  The  FCC  will  be  responsible  to  report  all  grounding  conditions  to  the aircraft  commander  and  the  618  AOC  (TACC),  or  the  theater  FPOC  or  AMD,  as  appropriate. PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER,  and  COPPER  aircraft  logistics  recovery  will  be  accomplished as prescribed in MAJCOM directives. 5.4.  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear (CBRN),  Passive  Defense Operations.  Aircrew  will  be  issued  appropriate  Individual  Protective  Equipment  (IPE)  when theater  commanders  determine  there  is  a  credible  CBRN  threat  or  actual  use  of  CBRN  during PHOENIX  BANNER,  SILVER,  and  COPPER  missions.  AMC  units  will  ensure  their  aircrews are issued IPE IAW AFI 11-301, Volume 1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program, and AFI 10-2501,  Air  Force  Emergency  Management  (EM)  Program,  Planning  and  Operations,  for ground crew IPE requirements. (T-1) AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015   21  Chapter 6 AIRCRAFT LOADING 6.1.  Helicopter  and  Vehicle  Loading.  Secure  vehicles  and  helicopters  using  1C-XXX-9 restraint criteria and this paragraph. 6.1.1.  Users  will  ensure  that  loadmasters/boom  operators  are  aware  of  all  additional unplanned  cargo  placed  in  vehicles  or  helicopters.  This  will  ensure  the  loadmaster/boom operator can calculate the proper weight and balance. 6.1.2.  USSS vehicles will be driven on the C-17 and C-130 facing forward, rather than being backed on. Normally USSS vehicles will be driven on the C-5 through the forward doors in the drive-in mode. Aft doors may be used at the discretion of the loadmaster. As a minimum, use  four  tie-down  chains  on  each  end  of  the  vehicle  (total  of  eight).  When  possible  for forward restraint, use at least two, 25,000-pound tie-down chains as part of the total tie-down requirement. 6.1.2.1.  C-130  aircraft  vehicle-loading  ramps.  89  APS  maintains  vehicle-loading  ramps for the C-130. Ramps will remain with vehicles for use on the return trip. After 89 APS vehicle loading ramps are properly positioned for loading or off loading, secure them to aircraft  auxiliary  loading  ramps  with  two  5,000-pound  cargo  straps.  Attach  the  ratchet end of the strap to tie-down rings of the sides of vehicle loading ramps and the hook end to  a  cross  member  of  the  aircraft  auxiliary  ramp.  89  APS  will  retrieve  ramps  on termination  of  the  mission.  This  procedure  should  only  be  used  when  vehicles  have  no other type of approach shoring. 6.1.3.  HMX-1 Support Missions. Loadmasters will load the aircraft IAW user-provided load plans. Loadmasters may adjust or deviate from the load plan only when the load plan exceeds an aircraft limitation, jeopardizes safety of flight, or conflicts with command guidance. 6.1.3.1.  When  loading  an  HMX-1  VH-3D  helicopter  on  a  C-17,  accomplish  aircraft refueling after loading due to possible clearance issues with less than full stabilizer strut extension. 6.1.3.2.  VH-60  helicopters  are  restrained  by  members  of  HMX-1  using  standard  tie-down  patterns.  For  ease  of  on  and  offload,  the  helicopter  should  be  loaded  down  the centerline of the transporting aircraft. Normally the tie-down consists of two 25,000 and six 10,000 pound chains for forward restraint, two 25,000 and two 10,000 pound chains for aft restraint, two 10,000 pound chains solely for lateral restraint and one 5,000 pound strap securing the tail wheel. The remaining lateral and vertical restraint requirements are normally met by the combination of all chains. Loadmasters will not change the tie-down of helicopters to meet personal preference. The overall responsibility to ensure the cargo is restrained adequately still rests with the aircraft loadmaster. 6.1.4.  User cargo preparation. See section 2.9 for waivers concerning cargo preparation. 6.1.5.  User  provided  cargo  documentation.  See  section  2.9  for  waiver  of  user-provided documentation.   22  AFI11-289  8 APRIL 2015 6.1.6.  Users will validate the weights and dimensions of cargo on their load plans to ensure aircrews have accurate data for computing the aircraft weight and balance.   All cargo will be weighed  prior  to  upload  and  the  data  provided  to  the  aircrew.    For  initial  departure,  an accurate  load  plan  from  the  89  APS  will  suffice  for  valid  weight  and  dimension  data.    En route  users  will  weigh  all  cargo  prior  to  upload  and  the  new  data  will  be  provided  to  the aircrew.  TOD D.
