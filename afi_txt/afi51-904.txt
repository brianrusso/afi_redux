Major changes were made to clarify procedures for processing initial applications for redress under Article 138, UCMJ,  and  subsequent  formal  complaints  under  Article  138,  UCMJ.    The  time  for  submitting the initial application for redress has been reduced from 180 days after discovery of an alleged wrong  to  90  days.    The  immediate  commander’s  time  for  responding  to  the  member’s  initial application  for  redress  has  been  reduced  from  60  days  to  30  days.    The  revised  instruction clarifies the scope of Article 138, UCMJ, providing clear criteria for determining how to process the initial application for redress and any subsequent formal complaint under Article 138, UCMJ.  It  explains  that  general  court-martial  convening  authorities  (GCMCAs)  may  rely  on  their  staff for  assistance;  however,  GCMCAs  may  not  delegate  their  responsibility  to  act  on  formal complaints filed pursuant  to  Article 138, UCMJ, or to  respond to  complainants.   Attachment  1 provides  references,  acronyms,  and  terms.    Attachments  2  and  3  provide  sample  formats  for preparing the initial application for redress under Article 138, UCMJ, and the subsequent formal complaint  under  Article  138,  UCMJ.    The  revision  clarifies  that  e-mail  submissions  will  be accepted; however, hard-copy submissions are preferred.  1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.

Purpose.  This  instruction  implements  Article  138,  UCMJ,  which  states:    “Any  member  of the armed forces who believes himself wronged by his commanding officer, and who, upon due application  to  that  commanding  officer,  is  refused  redress,  may  complain  to  any  superior commissioned  officer,  who  shall  forward  the  complaint  to  the  officer  exercising  general  court-martial  jurisdiction  over  the  officer  against  whom  it  is  made.    The  officer  exercising  general AFI51-904  28 JULY 2015   3  court-martial  jurisdiction  shall  examine  into  the  complaint  and  take  proper  measures  for redressing  the  wrong  complained  of;  and  he  shall,  as  soon  as  possible,  send  to  the  Secretary concerned a true statement of that complaint, with the proceedings had thereon.” 2.  Policy. 2.1.  A  member  of  the  armed  forces  (see  Attachment  1)  has  a  statutory  right  to  submit  a formal complaint under Article 138, UCMJ, to the appropriate GCMCA after: 2.1.1.  The member has first submitted an initial application for redress under Article 138, UCMJ,  requesting  relief  from  the  commander  who  has  allegedly  committed  the  wrong against the member; and 2.1.2.  The commander has wholly or partially denied the member’s initial application for redress under Article 138, UCMJ, or has failed to respond in the required timeframe. 2.2.  Commanders must act on initial applications for redress under Article 138, UCMJ, and GCMCAs must act on any subsequent formal complaints under Article 138, UCMJ. 2.3.  Commanders  will  not  restrict  the  submission  of  initial  applications  for  redress  under Article  138,  UCMJ,  or  subsequent  formal  complaints  under  Article  138,  UCMJ.  Commanders  will  not  take  action  in  retaliation  or  reprisal  against  members  for  submitting initial applications for redress or any subsequent formal complaints. 2.4.  The member may voluntarily withdraw his or her submission under Article 138, UCMJ, at  any  time  before  either  the  commander  complained  against  takes  final  action  or  the GCMCA  takes  final  action,  by  making  a  written  request  to  the  officer  in  possession  of  the submission. 2.5.  The Article 138, UCMJ, complaint resolution process  is  administrative in  nature.  The standard of proof that applies is proof by a preponderance of the evidence. 3.  Subject Matter. 3.1.  Submissions within the Scope of Article 138, UCMJ.  Matters reviewed under Article 138, UCMJ, include discretionary acts or omissions by a commander that adversely affect the member personally and allegedly are: 3.1.1.  A violation of law or regulation; 3.1.2.  Beyond the legitimate authority of that commander; 3.1.3.  Arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; or 3.1.4.  Clearly unfair or unjust. 3.2.  Submissions outside the Scope of Article 138, UCMJ.  Matters that are not reviewed under Article 138, UCMJ, include, but are not limited to: 3.2.1.  Submissions  related  to  acts  or  omissions  that  were  not  initiated,  carried  out,  or approved by the member’s commander; 3.2.2.  Submissions  seeking  reversal  or  modification  of  non-discretionary  command actions.    For  example,  mandatory  filings  of  adverse  information  in  an  unfavorable information file (UIF) are not reviewed under Article 138, UCMJ;   4  AFI51-904  28 JULY 2015 3.2.3.  Submissions challenging the actions of the commander complained against which addressed an Article 138 application for redress, or actions by the GCMCA on an Article 138 complaint; 3.2.3.1.  However, a submission alleging that the commander or GCMCA failed to act on or forward a formal complaint, will be considered under Article 138, UCMJ, as a new application for redress against the commander or GCMCA, as appropriate. 3.2.4.  Submissions filed on behalf of another person; and 3.2.5.  Submissions requesting disciplinary action against another person. 3.3.  Submissions  within  the  Scope  of  Article  138,  UCMJ,  but  more  appropriately addressed by alternative review processes which have the authority necessary to grant or recommend to proper authorities, the requested relief. 3.3.1.  Submissions  requesting  relief  which  the  commander  and  the  GCMCA  lack authority to grant.  For example, actions initiated against the member when the governing directive requires final action by the Secretary of the Air Force. 3.3.2.  Submissions related to disciplinary action under the UCMJ, including nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ.  However, unlawful pre-trial confinement, deferral of  post-trial  confinement,  and  administrative  actions  taken  in  lieu  of  court-martial  or nonjudicial punishment under the UCMJ are reviewed under Article 138, UCMJ. 3.4.  Submissions More Appropriately Referred to Alternate Channels.  In many matters complained  of,  there  already  exist  by  law  or  regulation,  specific  alternative  established channels  to  accomplish  the  objective  of  the  complainant.    These  include,  for  example,  the Board  for  Correction  of  Military  Records,  the  Air  Force  Discharge  Review  Board,  the Evaluation  Reports  and  Appeals  Board.    The  commander  or  GCMCA  may  resolve  the complaint by notifying the member of the alternate channel. 3.4.1.  Complaints that may be resolved by alternate channels include, but are not limited to, complaints concerning: 3.4.1.1.  Challenges  to  any  evaluation  report  required  by  AFI,  which  affects  a member’s  military  career  (e.g.,  OPRs,  EPRs,  RRFs,  PRFs,  etc.,)  addressed  by  the Evaluation Reports and Appeals Board (ERAB); 3.4.1.2.  Relief from an assessment for pecuniary liability (Secretary of the Air Force Remissions Board (SAFRB)); 3.4.1.3.  A suspension from flying status (Flying Evaluation Board (FEB)); and 3.4.1.4.  Set aside of Non-Judicial Punishment actions (Art 15, UCMJ) 3.4.2.  Upon receipt of a complaint for which more specific channels and procedures are available, the commander or GCMCA may act on it as prescribed in paragraphs 5.4.4 and 8.6.4. 4.  Member’s Submission of the Initial Application for Redress under Article 138, UCMJ. 4.1.  To begin the Article 138, UCMJ, process, an Air Force member must submit his or her initial application for redress to the commander who allegedly wronged the member. AFI51-904  28 JULY 2015   5  4.1.1.  If the commander who allegedly wronged the member is no longer in command of the  member,  the  member  must  still  submit  the  initial  application  for  redress  to  the commander who allegedly wronged the member, regardless of that commander’s current position or duty location, or the member’s current position or duty location. 4.1.2.  If the commander who allegedly wronged the member is no longer in the service, e.g., separated or retired, then the member must submit the initial application for redress to the successor commander occupying the complained of command billet at the time the initial application for redress is submitted. 4.2.  When  submitting  the  initial  application  for  redress,  the  member  must  state  the application  for  redress  is  being  submitted  pursuant  to  Article  138,  UCMJ.    For  guidance, Attachment  2  contains  a  sample  format  for  the  initial  application  for  redress.    The  initial application for redress must be submitted in writing.  Hard-copy submissions are preferred, however e-mail submissions will also be accepted.  Submissions must contain the following information: 4.2.1.  The member’s current military unit and the member’s military unit at the time of the alleged wrong, if different; 4.2.1.1.  If the application for redress is from a member of the Air National Guard or Air  Force  Reserve,  include  information  to  establish  the  alleged  wrong  was  done  in connection  with  a  period  of  the  member’s  federal  service  on  active  duty  or  federal service on inactive-duty training. 4.2.2.  The member’s current mailing address.  The member shall notify the commander or  GCMCA,  as  appropriate,  of  any  changes  in  his  unit  of  assignment  or  home  mailing address while the application or complaint are pending; 4.2.3.  The name of the commander against whom the complaint is made; 4.2.4.  A description of the facts and circumstances of the alleged wrong; 4.2.5.  A statement of the relief sought; and 4.2.6.  All supporting evidence available to the member. 4.3.  The member must submit the initial application for redress to the commander within 90 days of the member’s discovery of the alleged wrong.  Untimely applications for redress will be denied without a determination on the merits of the submission and will be returned to the member  in  accordance  with  paragraph  5.4.3.3,  unless  the  commander  waives  the  time requirements for good cause. 4.4.  At the outset, the burden of persuasion is on the member.  If evidence provided by the member does not  establish a valid basis for a complaint, the commander against whom the complaint  was  made  is  presumed  to  have  acted  properly,  and  the  application  for  redress  or complaint may be denied. 4.5.  The  member  may  consult  a  military  defense  counsel  for  advice  and  assistance  in drafting submissions under Article 138, UCMJ.  The member may also consult civilian legal counsel at no expense to the Government. 5.  Commander’s Review of an Initial Application for Redress under Article 138, UCMJ.   6  AFI51-904  28 JULY 2015 5.1.  The  commander  must  consult  with  the  servicing  SJA  before  taking  action  on  the member’s  initial  application  for  redress.    However,  a  formal  legal  review  of  an  initial application for redress is not required. (T-1). 5.2.  The  commander  may  initiate  any  proceedings  or  inquiries  that  he  or  she  considers necessary  to  respond  to  an  initial  application  for  redress.    The  member  may  be  asked  to provide  a  statement,  furnish  additional  information,  or  otherwise  assist  in  resolving  the matter.  Neither the member nor his or her counsel has a right to participate in proceedings or inquiries convened to resolve the complaint.  However, the member and counsel may attend proceedings or inquiries that are also open to the public. 5.3.  The  commander  may  consider  evidence  in  addition  to  matters  attached  to  the  initial application  for  redress  before  responding  to  the  member.    If  the  commander  considers additional evidence, it will be attached to the file so the GCMCA and the member can review all of the evidence. 5.4.  Not later than 30 days after receipt of the initial application for redress, the commander must notify the member in writing that (T-1): 5.4.1.  A  decision  regarding  the  requested  relief  has  been  deferred  to  allow  for  the completion  of  further  fact  gathering.    Such  notice  of  a  deferral  shall  be  sent  every  30 days  until  such  fact  gathering  proceeding  is  completed.    Such  notice  prohibits  the member  from  requesting  GCMCA  review,  as  provided  in  paragraph  6.3,  until  90  days have elapsed from the initial application for redress; or 5.4.2.  The requested relief is granted; or 5.4.3.  The requested relief is wholly or partially denied because: 5.4.3.1.  The requested relief is not warranted; 5.4.3.2.  The  submission  is  outside  the  scope  of  Article  138,  UCMJ  (see  paragraph 3.2); 5.4.3.3.  The submission is untimely (see paragraph 4.3); or 5.4.3.4.  There  is  a  more  appropriate  channel  for  reviewing  the  complaint  (see paragraph 3.4). 5.4.4.  If the commander denies the requested relief because there is  a more appropriate channel  for  reviewing  the  complaint  or  the  commander  lacks  authority  to  grant  the requested relief, the commander must (T-1): 5.4.4.1.  Forward  the  submission  (including  any  supporting  evidence)  to  the appropriate processing office or officer, if any, with authority to  grant the requested relief; or 5.4.4.2.  Return  the  submission  (including  any  supporting  evidence)  to  the  member and  direct  the  member  to  the  appropriate  office  or  officer,  if  any,  with  authority  to grant the requested relief; and 5.4.4.3.  If  appropriate,  inform  the  member  of  his  or  her  right  to  file  an  application with the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records, in accordance with Air Force  Instruction  (AFI)  36-2603,  Air  Force  Board  for  Correction  of  Military AFI51-904  28 JULY 2015   7  Records,  and  Air  Force  Pamphlet  (AFPAM)  36-2607,  Applicants’  Guide  to  the  Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR). 5.5.  If  the  commander  to  whom  the  initial  application  for  redress  was  submitted  is  a MAJCOM,  DRU,  or  FOA  commander,  that  commander’s  response  to  the  member’s  initial application  for  redress  shall  identify  for  the  member  the  appropriate  GCMCA  over  the commander. (T-1). 5.6.  The commander must ensure that any information released outside of official channels complies  with  the  provisions  of  AFI  33-332,  The  Air  Force  Privacy  and  Civil  Liberties Program. (T-0). 5.7.  In all cases, the commander shall retain a copy of the initial application for redress, the supporting evidence, and the commander’s response to the member for two years. (T-1). 5.8  If a commander who receives an initial application for redress is not the commander who allegedly wronged the member, the commander in receipt of the initial application for redress will forward the member’s matters to the commander complained against; and the member will be notified in writing that the initial application for redress has been forwarded to the commander who allegedly wronged the member.  The member may be asked to furnish additional information to assist in identifying the commander who allegedly wronged the member. 6.  Member’s Submission of the Formal Complaint under Article 138, UCMJ. 6.1.  If the member’s commander wholly or partially denies an initial application for redress under  Article  138,  UCMJ,  the  member  must  request  GCMCA  review  within  30  days  after receiving  the  commander’s  written  response  denying,  in  whole  or  in  part,  the  initial application for redress. 6.2.  If after  30  days from  the submission  of the initial  application for redress,  the member has  received  no  response  from  the  commander  who  allegedly  wronged  the  member,  the member must request GCMCA review within 60 days from the date the initial application for redress was submitted. 6.3.  If  the  member’s  commander  has  notified  the  member  that  a  decision  regarding  the requested  relief  has  been  deferred  (in  accordance  with  paragraph  5.4.1),  the  member  may only request GCMCA review after 90 days from the initial application for redress. 6.4.  The  member  may  submit  the  formal  Article  138  complaint  directly  to  the  GCMCA exercising jurisdiction  over the commander  against  whom the initial  application for  redress was made, or through any superior commissioned officer. 6.5.  Untimely  formal  complaints  under  Article  138,  UCMJ,  will  be  denied  without  a determination on the merits of the submission and returned to the member in accordance with paragraph 8.6.3.3, unless the GCMCA waives the time requirement for good cause. 6.6.  NOTE:    The  member’s  submission  constitutes  the  filing  of  a  formal  complaint  under Article  138,  UCMJ,  even  if  the  format  and  content  have  not  changed  from  the  initial application for redress under Article 138, UCMJ. 6.7.  When submitting a formal complaint, the member must state that the formal complaint is  being  submitted pursuant  to  Article 138, UCMJ.  For  guidance,  Attachment 3 contains  a   8  AFI51-904  28 JULY 2015 sample format for a formal complaint under Article 138, UCMJ.  The formal complaint must be submitted in writing.  Hard-copy submissions are preferred, however e-mail submissions will also be accepted.  Submissions must contain the following information: 6.7.1.  The member’s current military unit and the member’s military unit at the  time of the alleged wrong, if different; 6.7.1.1.  If  the  complaint  is  from  a  member  of  the  Air  National  Guard  or  Air  Force Reserve, include information to  establish the alleged wrong was done in connection with  a  period  of  the  member’s  federal  service  on  active  duty  or  federal  service  on inactive-duty training. 6.7.2.  The member’s current home mailing address; 6.7.3.  The name of the commander who committed the alleged wrong; 6.7.4.  A description of the facts and circumstances of the alleged wrong; 6.7.5.  A statement of the relief sought; 6.7.6.  The date on which the initial application for redress under Article 138, UCMJ, was submitted to the member’s commander; 6.7.7.  The date on which the requested relief was denied, in whole or part, or a statement that the commander failed to respond within the required timeframe; and 6.7.8.  All  supporting  evidence  available  to  the  member,  to  include  a  copy  of  the  initial application for redress, with its attachments, and the commander’s written response. 6.7.9.  NOTE:    The  member  may  not  add  new  allegations  of  wrongdoing  or  submit additional  evidence  without  first  submitting  the  allegation(s)  or  evidence  to  the commander who allegedly wronged the member. 6.8.  If  the  immediate  commander  to  whom  the  initial  application  was  submitted  is  a GCMCA,  the  member  must  submit  the  subsequent  formal  complaint  to  the  GCMCA exercising jurisdiction over the GCMCA commander. 7.  Forwarding the Member’s Formal Complaint under Article 138, UCMJ. 7.1.  If  an  intermediate  commander  or  superior  commissioned  officer  receives  a  formal complaint,  where  the  requested  relief  has  been  denied  in  whole  or  in  part,  he  or  she  must forward the submission to the GCMCA who currently exercises GCMCA jurisdiction over the commander against whom the initial application for redress was made. (T-1). 7.2.  If  an  intermediate  commander  or  superior  commissioned  officer  receives  a  formal complaint, but determines the member has not submitted an initial application for redress to the commander who allegedly wronged the member, the intermediate commander or superior commissioned  officer  will  forward  the  member’s  matters  to  the  commander  complained against;  and  the  member  will  be  notified  in  writing  that  his  or  her  complaint  under  Article 138, UCMJ, has been forwarded to the commander who allegedly wronged the member.  The member  may  be  asked  to  furnish  additional  information  to  assist  in  identifying  the commander who allegedly wronged the member. 7.3.  The  appropriate  GCMCA  may  be  determined  by  consulting  the  servicing  Air  Force legal  office,  or  referring  to  AFI  51-201,  Administration  of  Military  Justice,  Section  2A.    If AFI51-904  28 JULY 2015   9  the commander who allegedly wronged the member is assigned to a unit commanded by an officer  senior  in  grade  to  the  GCMCA  for  the  installation,  then  the  complaint  should  be forwarded to the next senior GCMCA in the chain of command. 8.  GCMCA’s Review of a Formal Complaint under Article 138, UCMJ. 8.1.  A  GCMCA  who  receives  a  written  application  to  correct  an  alleged  wrong  committed by a subordinate commander may rely on his or her staff for assistance to investigate and/or document findings, but shall not delegate authority to act on formal complaints filed pursuant to Article 138, UCMJ, or to respond to complainants. 8.2.  If  the  member  submits  a  formal  complaint  under  Article  138,  UCMJ,  to  the  GCMCA without  first  submitting  an  initial  application  for  redress  to  the  commander  who  allegedly wronged  the  member,  the  GCMCA  will  forward  the  submission  to  the  subordinate commander,  and  notify  the  member  that  the  submission  was  forwarded  to  the  commander who  allegedly  wronged  the  member.    In  addition,  if  the  member  submitted  an  initial application  for  redress  to  the  commander  complained  against,  but  adds  new  allegations  of wrongdoing or new evidence (which has not been submitted to the subordinate commander) in their formal complaint to the GCMCA, those new allegations or evidence will be returned to  the  commander  complained  against  for  initial  review  and  appropriate  action.    The GCMCA may defer final action on the complaint until all allegations have been dealt with by the commander complained against. 8.3.  The GCMCA may conduct or direct an investigation that he or she considers necessary to  respond  to  the  submission.    The  member  may  be  asked  to  provide  a  statement,  furnish additional information, or otherwise assist in resolving the matter.  Neither the member nor his or her counsel have the right to participate in an investigation or proceedings convened to resolve  the  complaint.    However,  the  member  and  counsel  may  attend  proceedings  or inquiries that are also open to the public. 8.4.  The  GCMCA  must  obtain  a  written  legal  review  from  the  servicing  SJA  before responding  to  the  member’s  formal  complaint.    (T-1).    The  legal  review  will  include  a summary  of  the  relevant  facts,  a  determination  of  the  legal  sufficiency  of  the  proceedings, and  a  recommended  action.    The  servicing  SJA  will  ensure  that  all  underlying  evidence relevant to the complaint is attached to the file.  (Note:  The SJA legal review is privileged attorney  work  product  and  is  not  releasable  to  the  member  or  other  individuals  under  the Freedom of Information Act.) 8.5.  If a matter collateral to the formal complaint has been reviewed or is pending review by another authority (for example, Inspector General or Military Equal Opportunity programs), the GCMCA may consider that authority’s findings and action to determine whether overlap exists  with  the  Article  138,  UCMJ,  process  before  taking  action.    If  overlap  does  exist,  the GCMCA  may  defer  action  on  the  formal  complaint  under  Article  138,  UCMJ,  until  the related  collateral  inquiry  has  been  resolved  to  avoid  duplicative  processing.

If  the  GCMCA  believes  the  requested  relief  should  be  granted  and  the authority  to  grant  the  relief  requested  resides  with  another  GCMCA,  MAJCOM,  or the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  the  GCMCA  should  include  the  recommendation  in the final action. 8.7.

An application for redress under Article 138, UCMJ, begins the Article 138, UCMJ, process.  Before submitting a formal complaint under Article 138, UCMJ, the member must submit the initial application for redress to the commander who allegedly committed the wrong. Arbitrary and Capricious.—The absence of a rational connection between the facts found and the decision made, constituting a clear error of judgment.  The action does not appear to be based on  consideration  of  relevant  factors  or  is  taken  without  observance  of  procedure  required  by regulation or law. Commander  or  Commanding  Officer.    A  commissioned  officer  occupying  a  command billet.    Officers  occupying  “command—like”  staff  positions  are  not  commanders.    Civilian directors and leaders of Air Force organizations are not commanders. Formal Complaint under Article 138, UCMJ—.  A member’s written formal complaint under Article 138, UCMJ, which can be submitted to the GCMCA only after the commander wholly or partially denies the member’s initial application for redress under Article 138, UCMJ, or fails to respond within 30 days. General  Court—Martial  Convening  Authority  (GCMCA).  The officer currently  exercising general court-martial convening authority over the commander against whom a formal complaint under Article 138, UCMJ, is made. Member  of  the  Armed  Forces.    A  member  of  the  United  States  Army,  Navy,  Air  Force, Marine  Corps,  or  Coast  Guard,  as  defined  in  10  U.S.C.  §  101(a)(4).    The  Air  Force  is further defined in 10 U.S.C. § 8062 as members of the Regular Air Force, the Air National Guard of the United States,  the Air National  Guard while in service of the United States, and the Air Force Reserve.  Complaints from members of the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve are limited to allegations arising from a discretionary act or omission by a commander that was done in connection with a period of the member’s federal service on active duty as well as the period of federal service on inactive—duty training. Preponderance  of  the  Evidence.—The  standard  of  proof  used  in  Article  138,  UCMJ, complaints.   14  AFI51-904  28 JULY 2015 A  preponderance  of  evidence  is  that  evidence  which,  when  fairly  considered,  produces  the stronger impression, has the greater weight, and is more convincing as to its truth when weighed against any evidence in opposition to it.  Redress.    Any  lawful  action  which  restores  to  the  member  any  rights,  privileges,  property,  or status to which the member would have been entitled had the alleged wrong not occurred, unless the member requests less than full restoration.  Superior Commissioned Officer.  Any commissioned officer who is senior, by grade or rank, to the commander who allegedly wronged the member.  A superior commissioned officer does not have to be a commander, but he or she cannot be a civilian.   Wrong.    A  discretionary  act  or  omission  by  a  commander  that  adversely  affects  the  member personally,  and  that,  for  example  is:    (1)  in  violation  of  law  or  regulation;  (2)  beyond  the legitimate authority of that commander; (3) arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; or (4) clearly unfair or unjust.  AFI51-904  28 JULY 2015   15  SAMPLE INITIAL APPLICATION FOR REDRESS UNDER ARTICLE 138, UCMJ Attachment 2           (Date)   (Current Mailing Address)   MEMORANDUM FOR  123 ABW/CC  FROM:  1st Lt John Doe   SUBJECT:  Application for Redress under Article 138, UCMJ  1.
