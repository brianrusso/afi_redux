Knowledge Overview (Lecture).  5.1.1.  The  AF  uses  a  variety  of  different  forklifts  (also  referred  to  as  “powered  industrial trucks”) to accomplish its mission, they range from small to large, from simple hand lifts to complex powered forklifts.  Like any other vehicle, training and licensing is a requirement to ensure an operator can operate a forklift safely and proficiently.  Forklift training, as required by OSHA, includes:  5.1.1.1.  A combination of formal instruction and practical demonstrations and exercises.  5.1.1.2.  A wide range of subjects and skills specified in the regulation.  5.1.1.3.  Refresher training must be given under a variety of specific circumstances.  5.1.1.4.  Operators shall be evaluated at least once every 3 years.  5.1.1.5.  Required training shall be certified in writing.      7 5.2.  Overview of Training and Requirements.  5.2.1.  Training objectives:  5.2.1.1.  Given lectures, demonstrations, review questions, hands-on driving session, and a performance and written test, trainees will be able to perform operator’s inspection and complete the performance test (go/no-go checklist) with zero instructor assists.  5.2.1.2.  Train and qualify each trainee in safe operation and preventive maintenance of the various forklifts.  5.2.1.3.  This training will ensure the trainee becomes a  qualified forklift operator—an operator who has the knowledge and skills to operate a forklift in a safe and professional manner.     5.2.2.  Desired learning outcomes:  5.2.2.1.  Understand  the  safety  precautions  to  be  followed  before-,  during-,  and  after-operation of the forklift.  5.2.2.2.  Understand the purpose of the forklift and its role in the mission.  5.2.2.2.1.   Purpose is for cargo movement.  5.2.2.2.2.   Role in the mission (Unit/Base/Community (during natural disasters)/Air Force).  5.2.2.2.3.   Know  the  proper  operator  maintenance  procedures  of  the  forklift,  IAW applicable technical orders and use of AF Form 1800.  5.2.2.2.4.   Be able to safely and proficiently operate the forklift.  5.2.2.2.4.1.  Meet mission requirements.  5.2.2.2.4.2.  Demonstrates a qualified trained professional operator. 5.2.3.  Forklift Design.  Forklifts vary in size, shape and specifications, determined by make and model; it is imperative to know the specifications and rated loads of the forklift that will be operated before use.  Specifications and rated load information should be used together to determine the proper use and area in which the forklift will be used.  This information is best found in the appropriate TO or for quick reference, the information may be found on the vehicle data plate located on the forklift, see Figure 5.1. for an example of a forklift data plate.  5.2.4.  While  the  discussion  following  will  explain  the  general  design  of  a  forklift,  it  is recommended that the operator studies the manufacturer’s operator manual for the specifics of the forklift. 8  Figure 5.1.  Forklift Data Plate Example.   5.2.5.  Specifications.  Specifications generally described are equipment dimensions/weight; engine/drive  train  information;  turning  radius;  and  engine/drive  train  fluid  types.    Forklift specifications can be found on the vehicle’s data plate, and the Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual or appropriate TO for the vehicle.  5.2.6.  Rated Load/Capabilities.  Rated loads and capabilities generally described are lifting capacity; load center; maximum reach; and maximum stacking height.       Note:  Specifications given are for a centered and balanced load.  Lifting the maximum amount of the forklift capacity when the load is not properly balanced could cause tipping of the forklift.  5.2.7.  Forklift  Parts.    The  make-up  of  a  forklift  differs  by  make  and  model,  however  all forklifts will have a counterweight, lifting mast, or device and overhead guard.  5.2.7.1.  Counterweights.    The  counterweight  on  a  forklift  does  exactly  what  its  name implies; it counters, or opposes the forces of the load put on the forklift.  5.2.7.1.1.   Counterweights come in many shapes and sizes.  Some are removable or can be stacked/un-stacked to eliminate weight when small loads are being handled over soft terrain or for shipping purposes.  5.2.7.1.2.   Most counterweights are rested into place and require little hardware to keep them in place.  Therefore, it is in the best interest to ensure the counterweight is securely fastened  to  the  forklift  before  operation.    Figure  5.2.  illustrates  different  styles  of counterweights.  9 Figure 5.2.  Forklift Counterweight Styles.    5.2.7.2.  Lifting  mast  or  device.    Lifting  devices  on  forklifts  can  be  complicated  or extremely simple.  Lifting devices differ by make, model and function for which they are used.  5.2.7.2.1.   Some forklifts in the AF inventory are equipped to rotate loads; some masts swing in and out, while other masts are boom style.  There are many different models; therefore it is imperative the trainee becomes fully trained on the model that the trainee is about to operate.  One of the big differences in lifting devices is “reach”.  5.2.7.2.2.   Standard forklifts lift loads straight up and down, while all terrain (AT) and other models of forklifts lift their masts at an angle and “reach” when raised.  Figure 5.3. shows the difference in lifting device reach.  Figure 5.3.  Lifting Device Reach.   5.2.7.3.  Overhead guards.  Overhead guards are put in place to protect the operator in case of falling objects and should the forklift tip over.  5.2.7.3.1.   In the case of forklifts with cabs, the overhead guard is built into the cab itself.  These also provide protection from the outside elements of the environment.  5.2.7.3.2.   Some of these cabs are removable for shipping purposes, after shipment, these  cabs  should  be  put  back  in  place  before  operation  continues.    Figure  5.4. illustrates different styles of overhead guards.  10     Figure 5.4.  Overhead Guards.   5.2.8.  Forklift Steering and Speed Control.   5.2.8.1.  Steering.    The  majority  of  forklifts  utilize  rear  wheel  steering  or  articulated steering.  The ability of using rear wheel steering gives the operator more maneuverability for placing loads in the correct position and moving through tight warehouse locations.  5.2.8.1.1.   Articulated steering is used mainly on all terrain forklifts, this function is best for all wheel drive equipment, as it requires less differential slipping.  Of course these steering systems can take some time to get used to.  5.2.8.1.2.   Having the rear wheel steering adds more areas that the operator needs to have good visibility.  While turning the forklift, not only does the front of the equipment move, but the rear as well, adding to more possibilities of striking something.  5.2.8.1.3.   Articulated steering gives the view of all moving parts in the same direction, as long as the equipment’s operator station is high enough with unrestricted visibility this is a benefit to the operator.  Figure 5.5. illustrates different steering systems used on most forklifts, and the difference of front wheel steering. Figure 5.5.  Forklift Steering Systems.    5.2.8.2.  Speed Control.  Speed not only makes accidents more likely, but also makes death in accidents more likely.  Never operate a vehicle at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the existing conditions.     11 5.2.8.2.1.   Speed  affects  the  ability  to  turn,  pass,  slow  down  and  stop.    The  most important safety factor in any vehicle is the control the driver has over the machine.  5.2.8.2.2.   The faster the vehicle goes and the more of that control the driver gives up, the less chance the driver has of avoiding an accident and the more deadly the accident will be.  5.2.8.2.3.   Accelerating.  Gradually accelerate a forklift to minimize jerking.  Rapid acceleration can cause mechanical failure and is considered vehicle misuse.  Jerking and  rapid  acceleration  also  contributes  to  loads  falling  off  the  forks  and  adding unnecessary hazards to pedestrians around the vehicle.  5.2.8.2.4.   Steering.  5.2.8.2.4.1.  Normally, both hands are kept on the steering wheel while operating the forklift.  During loading and unloading the left hand is used to steer while the right hand operates the hydraulic controls. 5.2.8.2.4.2.  Remember  to  turn  slowly;  a  forklift  is  unstable  when  the  forks  are elevated, with or without a load.  Tip-over can occur when the forklift is empty.  Avoid turning on an incline.  Watch tail swing when making turns observing rear clearances.  5.2.8.2.5.   Stopping.  Stop the forklift as gradually as possible.  Hard braking and wheel sliding are unnecessary and may cause the load to fall off the forks, possibly damaging the load and/or hurting someone.  The following factors affect the ability to bring the forklift to a stop:   5.2.8.2.5.1.  Type  and  condition  of  road  surface,  such  as  concrete,  asphalt,  or gravel.  5.2.8.2.5.2.  Foreign material on the road, such as ice, snow, leaves, water, or mud.  5.2.8.2.5.3.  Road configuration, such as inclines, curves, high crowns.  5.2.8.2.5.4.  Tire conditions, such as type, tire inflation, and condition of tread.  5.2.8.2.5.5.  Brakes, such as type and state of repair and adjustment.  5.2.8.2.5.6.  Load on forklift, an unloaded forklift will stop sooner and smoother than a loaded one.      12  5.3.  Vehicle Inspection.  5.3.1.  Types of Vehicle Inspection.  Note:  If discrepancies are found the operator must report them to Vehicle Control Officer/Vehicle Control Non Commissioned Officer (VCO/VCNCO), the supervisor, and/or vehicle maintenance:  5.3.1.1.  Pre-trip inspection – find items/problems that could cause accident or breakdown.  5.3.1.1.1.   Vehicle maintenance to authorize continued use for all other maintenance discrepancies.  5.3.1.1.2.   Cleanliness/damage/missing items. 5.2.8.2.6.   Stopping Distance.  For any speed, the distance required to stop a forklift in an emergency depends on three things; driver perception time, driver reaction time, and forklift  stopping  time.    During  driver  perception  time  and  driver  reaction  time,  the forklift slows down very little because the brakes have not yet been applied.  Forklifts equipped with air brakes take additional time because it takes the air time to travel through the system to engage the brakes.  This is called brake lag.               5.3.1.1.3.   Leaks (fuel/oil/coolant/hydraulic/air). 5.3.1.1.4.   Fluid levels; ensure level is within limits: 5.3.1.1.4.1.  Engine oil. 5.3.1.1.4.2.  Brake fluid.  5.3.1.1.4.3.  Transmission fluid. 5.3.1.1.4.4.

Driving Safety and Precautions.  5.5.1.  Forklift Safety and Operator Maintenance.  Ensure trainee understands the importance of these safety items and procedures.  The following safety operations are directly from OSHA regulations, by abiding in these regulations and following RM processes operating a forklift can be accomplished without mishaps.  5.5.1.1.  Do NOT drive a forklift up to anyone standing in front of a bench or other fixed object.  5.5.1.2.  Do NOT stand, work, or pass under the elevated portion of any forklift, whether loaded or empty.  5.5.1.3.  Personnel shall NOT be permitted to ride on powered forklifts.  5.5.1.4.  Never place arms or legs between the uprights of the mast or outside the running lines of the forklift.  5.5.1.5.  When a forklift is left unattended:  fully lower forks, neutralize controls, shut-off power, and set brakes.  Block wheels if the forklift is parked on an incline.    19 5.5.1.6.  A forklift is unattended when the operator is 25 feet or more away from the vehicle which remains in his view or whenever the operator leaves the vehicle and it is not in his view.  5.5.1.7.  When the operator of a forklift is dismounted and within 25 feet of the truck still in view:  lower the load engaging means, neutralize controls, and set the brakes to prevent movement.  5.5.1.8.  Maintain  a  safe  distance  from  the  edge  of  ramps  or  platforms  while  on  any elevated dock, or platform or freight car.  5.5.1.9.  Do NOT use forklifts for opening or closing freight doors.  5.5.1.10.   Ensure sufficient headroom under overhead installations, lights, pipes, sprinkler system, etc.  5.5.1.11.   Ensure an overhead guard is in place as protection against falling objects.  An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load.  5.5.1.12.   Use a load backrest extension whenever necessary to minimize the possibility of the load or part of it from falling rearward.  5.5.1.13.   Only approved forklifts shall be used in hazardous locations.  5.5.1.14. Keep fire aisles, access to stairways, and fire equipment clear.  5.5.1.15.   Observe all traffic regulations.  Maintain a safe distance of approximately three forklift lengths from the vehicle ahead, and keep the forklift under control at all times.  5.5.1.16.   Yield the right of way to ambulances, fire trucks, or other vehicles in emergency situations.  5.5.1.17.   Do NOT pass other forklifts traveling in the same direction at intersections, blind spots, or other dangerous locations.  5.5.1.18.   The driver shall be required to slow down and sound the horn at cross aisles and other locations where vision is obstructed.  If the load being carried obstructs forward view, the driver shall be required to travel with the load trailing.  5.5.1.19.   Cross railroad tracks diagonally wherever possible.  Do NOT park closer than 8 feet from the center of railroad tracks.  5.5.1.20.   Look in the direction of, and keep a clear view of the path of travel.    20 5.5.1.21.   Ascend/descend grades slowly.  5.5.1.22.   When ascending or descending grades in excess of 10%, drive loaded trucks with the load upgrade.  5.5.1.23.   On all grades, tilt back the load and load engaging means, if applicable, and raise the load only as far as necessary to clear the road surface.  Drive forward up a ramp and back down a ramp.  5.5.1.24.   Operate the forklift under all travel conditions at a speed that will permit it to be brought to a stop in a safe manner.  5.5.1.25.   Stunt driving and horseplay will NOT be permitted.  5.5.1.26.   Slow down for wet and slippery floors.  5.5.1.27.   Properly  secure  board  or  bridge  plates  before  they  are  slowly  and  carefully driven over. Ensure their rated capacity never exceeded.  Remove snow or ice.  5.5.1.28.   Approach  elevators  slowly,  and  then  enter  squarely  after  the  elevator  car  is properly leveled.  Once on the elevator, neutralize controls, shut-off power and set brakes.  5.5.1.29.   Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward.  5.5.1.30.   Avoid running over loose objects on the roadway surface. 5.5.1.31.   While negotiating turns, reduce speed (braking) and steer in a smooth, sweeping motion.  Except when maneuvering at a very low speed, turn the hand steering wheel at a moderate, even rate.   Note:  Secure loads to the forklift when carrying bulky loads or traveling long distances.  5.6.  Forklift Load Composition and Stability.  5.6.1.  Definitions.  The following definitions help to explain the principle of stability.  5.6.1.1.  Center of gravity.  The point on an object at which all of the object's weight is concentrated.  For symmetrical loads, the center of gravity is at the middle of the load.  5.6.1.2.  Counterweight.  The weight that is built into the forklift’s basic structure and is used to offset the load's weight and to maximize the vehicle's resistance to tipping over.  5.6.1.3.  Fulcrum Point.  The point on the truck between which balances the weight of the truck and the weight of the load being carried.  The forklift’s axis of rotation when it tips over is called the fulcrum.   21  5.6.1.4.  Grade.  The slope of a surface, which is usually measured as the number of feet of rise or fall over a hundred foot horizontal distance (the slope is expressed as a percent).  5.6.1.5.  Lateral stability.  A forklift’s resistance to overturning sideways.  5.6.1.6.  Line of action.  An imaginary vertical line through an object's center of gravity.  5.6.1.7.  Load center.  The horizontal distance from the load's edge (or the fork's or other attachment's vertical face) to the line of action through the load's center of gravity.  5.6.1.8.  Longitudinal  stability.    The  forklift's  resistance  to  overturning  forward  or rearward.  5.6.1.9.  Moment.  The product of the object's weight times the distance from a fixed point (usually the fulcrum point).  In the case of a powered forklift, the distance is measured from the point at which the forklift will tip over to the object's line of action.  The distance is always measured perpendicular to the line of action.  5.6.1.10.   Track.  The distance between the wheels on the same axle of the forklift.  5.6.1.11.   Wheelbase.  The distance between the centerline of the vehicle's front and rear wheels.       22 5.6.2.  General.  Determining the stability of a forklift is simple once a few basic principles are understood.    There  are  many  factors  that  contribute  to  a  vehicle's  stability:    the  vehicle's wheelbase, track, and height; the load's weight distribution; and the vehicle's counterweight location  (if  the  vehicle  is  so  equipped).    The  "stability  triangle,"  used  in  most  stability discussions, demonstrates stability simply.  5.6.2.1.  Basic Principles.  Whether an object is stable depends on the object's moment at one end of a system being greater than, equal to, or smaller than the object's moment at the system's other end.  5.6.2.1.1.   This principle can be seen in the way a see-saw or teeter-totter works:  that is, if the product of the load and distance from the fulcrum point (moment) is equal to the moment at the device's other end, the device is balanced and it will  not move.  However, if there is a greater moment at one end of the device, the device will try to move downward at the end with the greater moment. 5.6.2.1.2.   The  longitudinal  stability  of  a  counterbalanced  powered  industrial  truck depends  on  the  vehicle's  moment  and  the  load's  moment.    In  other  words,  if  the mathematic  product  of  the  load  moment  (the  distance  from  the  front  wheels,  the approximate point at which the vehicle would tip forward) to the load's center of gravity times the load's weight is less than the vehicle's moment, the system is balanced and will  not  tip  forward.    However,  if  the  load's  moment  is  greater  than  the  vehicle's moment, the greater load-moment will force the truck to tip forward.  5.6.3.  Physics/Stability.  In order to safely operate a forklift one must understand the physical aspects of carrying a load.  5.6.3.1.  If a load is not properly balanced on the forks, tipping of the forklift or dropping of  the  cargo  can  result.    Loads  will  be  of  different  shapes,  weights  and  balance,  it  is imperative that correct load balancing is learned and practiced.  5.6.3.2.  To better the understanding of how a load will carry it is also important to know where the Center of Gravity of the forklift is and the parts of the forklift that add to this.  5.6.4.  Stability.  Stability is the resistance to sudden change, dislodgement or overthrow.  As one can guess the stability of the forklift is extremely important during operation.  5.6.4.1.  The center of gravity, dictated by the forklift, load size and weight on the forklift are  all  contributing  factors.    Forklift  stability  is  a  function  of  three-point  suspension (stability triangle), as indicated by Figure 5.6.  Figure 5.6. Center of Gravity.    5.6.4.2.  This stability triangle is formed by the drive axle tread of the forklift and the center point mount on the steering axle.  Each vehicle has an imaginary stability triangle, an area of the vehicle in which the center of gravity must remain.  5.6.4.3.  If the center of gravity shifts out of this triangle, handling characteristics diminish and tipping can follow.  Refer to Figure 5.6. for the remainder of this paragraph.   23    5.6.4.4.  Point D is the center of gravity of an empty forklift at rest on level ground.  Point F is the center of gravity of the load, and point E is the combined center of gravity of the forklift and load.  The combined center of gravity (point E) is with the triangle formed by points A, B, and C when the mast is vertical.  Stability depends upon how close point E comes to the edge of the triangle.  As this point approaches, or exceeds, the triangle’s boundary, the truck will tip.  5.6.4.5.  Remember that stability is not only a forward and backward concern.  As the center of gravity of the load is moved from left and right, the stability of the forklift is also.  5.6.4.5.1.   The concern here is that forklifts are longer than they are wide; the same goes for the stability triangle.  Tipping to the front is not as common as tipping to the side.  5.6.4.5.2.   This can happen due to poor handling practices (turning too hard and fast) and poor load planning (placing heavier object to the right or left).  At all times the center of gravity of the load and forklift must remain in the stability triangle.  Note:  Forward tipping can be caused by, loads that exceed the rated capacity, excessive forward tilt with the load elevated, or by abrupt stopping while the load is elevated.    5.6.5.  Load Handling.  The capacity of a forklift is given by weight and distance to the load center.  This information is listed on the forklift data plate.  5.6.5.1.  Before attempting to lift a load, make sure the weight is within the capacity of the forklift at the load center involved.  Also, the rated capacity presumes that the center of the load is no further from the top of the forks than it is from the face of the carriage.  5.6.5.2.  If these conditions do not exist, the operator may have to reduce the load weight since  the  center  of  gravity  may  be  out  of  the  stability  triangle.    See  Figure  5.7.  for illustration of load center and example.    24 Figure 5.7.  Forklift Load Center.   5.7.  Forklift Loading and Unloading.  5.7.1.  Loading and Unloading Safety.  The following are safe practices to be observed when loading and unloading include:  5.7.1.1.  Only handle stable and safely arranged loads.  Exercise caution when handling off-center loads which cannot be centered.  5.7.1.2.  Only handle loads within the rated capacity of the forklift.  5.7.1.3.  Adjust  the  long  or  high  (including  multiple-tiered)  loads  which  may  affect capacity.  5.7.1.4.  Operate forklifts equipped with attachments as partially loaded forklifts when not handling a load.  Use only attachments issued with the forklift or approved by the forklift manufacturer.  5.7.1.5.  Place the forks a load engaging means under the load as far as possible so that the load is up against the mast; the mast shall be carefully tilted backward to stabilize the load.    5.7.1.6.  Use extreme care when tilting the load forward or backward, particularly when high tiering.  Tilting forward with load engaging means elevation is prohibited except to pick up a load.  An elevated load will not be tilted forward except when the load is in a deposit position over a rack or stack.  When stacking or tiering, only use enough backward tilt to stabilize the load. 25  5.7.2.  Preparing Loads.  The operator may be tasked to prepare the load or transport it.  Either way as an operator moving the load, once the operator receives the load, the load becomes their responsibility.  It is therefore imperative to know if the load is ready for transport or not.  5.7.2.1.  Cargo  comes  in  all  shapes  and  sizes,  however  there  are  requirements  for  all.  Whenever possible, place cargo on pallets for stability.  5.7.2.2.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of different types of pallets and containers, however, in the AF most cargo will be packaged on skids, 463L pallets or self-contained (KITS pallet). These self-contained loads  will vary  as per the packaging requirements.  Self-contained loads require less prepping as long as they have been properly assembled and loaded.  See Figure 5.8. for different styles of loads.  Figure 5.8.  Forklift Load Styles.    5.7.2.3.  Loads will always be tightly packed to reduce shifting and secured to the pallet before transport.  Utilize  cargo nets, cargo straps, chains, or multiple layers of plastic wrap/straps for lighter loads to secure the load to the pallet.  5.7.2.3.1.   When  the  load  must  be  placed  outside  during  inclement  weather,  loads should be covered with tarpaulin for protection    5.7.2.3.2.   Loads traveling over-the-road require different load preparation than loads traveling on military airlift.  Contact Traffic Management Office (TMO) for further details and instructions.  26    Figure 5.9.  Properly/Improperly Loaded Pallet.    5.7.2.4.  Spotter.  Generally, standard forklifts have a diminished view of the working area in front of the operator.  Utilization of a spotter during loading and unloading of cargo is necessary to ensure the ability to see where the vehicle is going.  5.7.2.4.1.   If  visual  contact  with  the  spotter  is  lost,  the  spotter  is  dangerously positioned, or the operator is in doubt, the operator must immediately stop the vehicle.  5.7.2.4.2.   Hand signals are often used to communicate between the spotter and the operator, if ever in doubt on what the spotter is trying to communicate, the operator should stop immediately and clarify with the spotter the meaning of the hand signal(s).  Standard AF forklift-specific hand signals are pictured below.  See Figures 5.10. – 5.19.  Refer to AFMAN 24-306 for additional standard AF spotter hand signals.  Figure 5.10.

When approaching a load to pick it up; move in slowly, ensure the forklift is square and centered with the load and the forks are at the proper height for engaging the load.  Move slowly until the forks are entirely under the load.  5.7.2.5.1.   Forks  should  be  spread  according  to  the  load  width  for  the  maximum stability on the forks.  Ensure to not over extend the forks and damage a load behind the one being approached.  Forks should be longer than the load, after picking up the load, inch back, lower the load and fully rest the load against the carriage.  Raise the load from the surface and tilt back just enough to safely carry it.  5.7.2.5.2.   If the load is stacked, slowly back the forklift clear of the stack and lower the forks to a safe traveling height.  During loading of cargo it is the best practice to utilize a spotter in tight or low visibility areas.  The forklift mast blocking the operator’s view of the forks and load can cause low visibility.  5.7.2.6.  Transporting Loads.  5.7.2.6.1.   To transport a load, tilt the mast back just enough to travel safely.  Do not raise the load higher than what is necessary for adequate floor clearance.  5.7.2.6.2.   Travel in reverse in standard forklifts at all times with or without a load.  5.7.2.6.3.   Travel  forward  in  all  terrain  forklifts,  unless  visibility  is  impaired.    If visibility is impaired, travel in reverse.  5.7.2.6.4.   Avoid any sudden starts, stops and turns.  5.7.2.6.5.   Ensure  the  load  does  not  exceed  the  limitation of  the  forklift,  and  when starting to transport the load keep in mind the load may exceed the height and width of the forklift.  5.7.2.6.6.   Forklifts  should  not  be  used  to  transport  cargo  over  long  distances  or through heavy traffic areas.  It is better to load the cargo on a tractor/trailer, pickup, stake & platform truck, etc. for transport and then use a forklift at the distant end to download the cargo.  Pallets should be secured to the forklift when this is not possible.  5.7.2.7.  Unloading.  To unload on the floor, level the load with the floor and lower into place.  It may be necessary to tilt the forks forward to remove the load smoothly.  5.7.2.7.1.   Back out of the load.  When backing out of the load, ensure the back portion of the forks are not in contact with the floor; this can damage the carriage keepers, eventually causing them to break.     31 5.7.2.7.2.   To place the load on a stack, raise the load as the vehicle is inching into position.  Be careful not to collide with adjacent loads.  Once the load is square with the stack, level the load and lower the forks just enough to free them from the pallet, be careful not to drag the forks.  Back away from the load and lower the forks as soon as the vehicle has cleared the stack.  5.7.2.7.3.   When unloading 463L or KITS type pallets place load on shoring (dunnage).  Shoring  (dunnage)  provides  a  space  for  the  forks  to  easily  move  in  and  out  from underneath the load and keeps the pallets clean and dry.  Utilize at least three pieces of shoring (dunnage) for each pallet to prevent warping of the pallet.  5.8.  Forklift Operation.  5.8.1.  Operating  Inside  and  Outside  of  Warehouses.    Observe  the  following  items  when operating in and out of warehouses:  5.8.1.1.  Speed limit inside a warehouse is 5 miles per hour (mph).  5.8.1.2.  Stop  between  5  and  10  ft.,  sound  horn  prior  to  entering  all  warehouse openings/adjacent rooms  5.8.1.3.  Warehouse  ramps/Loading  docks:    Ensure  gear  selection  is  correct  for  safe operation in and out of buildings and prior to exiting ramps.  Forklifts will be downshifted to “L” or low prior to descending or ascending ramps.  5.8.1.4.  Only approved forklifts may be operated in warehouses with hazardous material.  5.8.1.5.  Operate fuel (gas, diesel, propane, compressed natural gas) powered forklifts in approved ventilated warehouses  5.8.2.  Forklift Attachments Use.  5.8.2.1.  Two of the most common attachments that can be encountered on a forklift are rollerized times and a personnel lift platform.  5.8.2.2.  Rollerized Tines.  Rollerized tines are used to unload rollerized trailers, rollerized docks, and aircraft during contingency operations.  This accessory simplifies some tasks but at the same time adds to hazards.  5.8.2.2.1.   When rollerized tines are issued with the forklift, these will be added to pre-inspections and preventive maintenance procedures.  Rollerized tines will be turned in to transportation with the forklift for scheduled maintenance.  5.8.2.2.2.   Rollerized tines will only be utilized on forks of the same size and capability as  the  forklift  they  are  issued  with.    Rollerized  tines  will  not  be  utilized  as  fork extensions at any time.   32  5.8.2.2.3.   Do not utilize rollerized tines for SKID type pallets.  5.8.2.2.4.   Lay the tines on a level floor and slowly drive into them.  Do not lift the tines onto the forks.  5.8.2.2.5.   Ensure rollerized tines are mechanically secured to the forks.  5.8.2.2.6.   Whenever a load is placed on the rollerized tines, the load must be secured to the forklift.  5.8.2.2.7.   Use  rollerized  tines  only  when  necessary  and  for  the  shortest  distance needed.  5.8.2.2.8.   When stored, rollerized tines will be kept in the work area and not present a tripping hazard.  5.8.2.3.  Personnel Lift Platform.  Whenever a forklift is equipped with vertical controls only, or vertical or horizontal, the following additional precautions shall be taken for the protection of personnel being elevated:  5.8.2.3.1.   Use of safety platform firmly secured to the lifting carriage and/or forks.  5.8.2.3.2.   Means shall be provided whereby personnel on the platform can shut off power to the forklift.  5.8.2.3.3.   Protection  from  falling  objects  as  indicated  necessary  by  the  operating conditions shall be provided.  5.8.2.4.  Parking.  Parking of a forklift has a few more added requirements than parking a vehicle.  Never leave the forklift in a condition that can cause damage and injury.  Do not park a forklift so that it limits access to fire aisles, stairways and fire equipment.  To park a forklift:  5.8.2.4.1.   Find a level area to park the forklift.  5.8.2.4.2.   Stop the forklift, place transmission control in neutral and apply the parking brake.  5.8.2.4.3.   Lower the carriage completely; tilt the mast forward until the fork tips touch the ground.  5.8.2.4.4.   On a forklift with a turbo-charged engine, let the engine idle for 5 minutes.  5.8.2.4.5.   On a forklift without a turbo, let the engine idle according to manufacturer’s recommendation.   33  5.8.2.4.6.   Turn-off all lights and accessories.  5.8.2.4.7.   Turn ignition switch to the OFF position.  5.8.2.4.8.   If applicable turn the master switch to the OFF position.  5.8.2.4.9.   If the forklift must be parked on an incline or flightline, chock the drive wheels.  5.8.2.4.10.  Drain air tanks if applicable.  5.8.2.4.11.  Perform a walk around inspection of the forklift.  5.8.2.5.  Flightline  Rules  and  Regulations.    Refer  to  AFI  13-213,  Airfield  Driving  and AFMAN 24-306.  5.8.2.5.1.

Desired Learning Outcome.  A2.1.1. Understand the safety precautions to be followed before, during, and after operation of the forklift.  A2.1.2. Understand the purpose of the forklift and their role in the mission.  A2.2.   Inspection  During-Operations.    The  operator  must  ensure  the  following  items  are checked after starting the forklift and during operations.  A2.2.1. Gauges and Warning Lights.  Most warning lights will show when the ignition is in the start position to show proper operation of the bulb.  Some gauges will “peg” to one side showing operation.  A2.2.2. Once the engine has started these warning lights should go out and gauges will go to appropriate readings.  It is important the operator becomes familiar with the proper operating readings  of  gauges;  specific  meaning  of  warning  and  indicator  lights  and  what  to  do  if indications are warning of a malfunction on the forklift the operator will be operating.  A2.2.3. Some  forklifts  will  have  all  these  items  and  some  will  be  limited.    Along  with indicators and gauges; warning lights may service the same function, however placed on the forklift  as  an  added  precaution  from  operator  error.    Some  generic  forklift  warning  lights, indicators and gauges are shown as follows:     47 Figure A2.1.  Forklift Warning Lights.  Display:              Response: Wait for pressure to build up before moving forklift. Check engine oil level, fill to required level. Discontinue use and contact VCO/VCNCO for support. Will remain on until parking brake is released. Discontinue use and contact VCO/VCNCO for support. Discontinue use and contact VCO/VCNCO for support. Discontinue use and contact VCO/VCNCO for support. Remove and shake out air filter if dry type. Indicates: Indicates low brake pressure. Indicates low engine oil pressure Indicates machine requires servicing soon.   Indicates parking brake is engaged. Indicates an electrical malfunction. Indicates the transmission filter restriction. Indicates the hydraulic oil filter restriction. Indicates the air filter is restricted. Indicates intake air restricted. Indicates transmission overheating. Indicates alternator malfunction. Indicates coolant level is low. Indicates seatbelt not in use.  Fasten seat belt. Remove and shake out air filter if dry type. Stop use of forklift and let transmission cool down. Check drive belt tension.  Check coolant level and fill.  Figure A2.2.  Forklift System Gauges.  Display: Gauge: Description:   Hour Meter Ammeter  Operates when the key switch is ON and the engine is running.  Actuates once the ignition switch is ON, shows the amount of AMPS the alternator is putting out. Reading Evaluation: Periodic maintenance and vehicle rotations are based on these hours. Normal ammeters indicate red or green.  If the gauge shows red check for alternator belt tension first. 48    Transmission Oil Temperature Coolant System Temperature Actuates once the ignition switch is ON, shows reading of transmission fluid temperature. Actuates once the ignition switch is ON, shows reading of engine coolant temperature. Engine Oil Pressure Actuates once the ignition switch is ON and the engine is running, shows reading of engine oil pressure System Air Pressure Actuates once the ignition switch is ON, shows reading of system air pressure.     Hydraulic Filter Restriction  Actuates once hydraulic fluid flow has started, normally once the engine is running. Air Filter Restriction  This indicator holds the highest restriction reading until manually reset. During heavy movement or driving on inclines the transmission temperature will increase.  If it shows over heating discontinue use and let the vehicle cool.  Check fluid level. During heavy movement or driving on inclines the coolant temperature will increase.  If it shows over heating discontinue use and let the vehicle cool.  Check coolant level. When the engine is cold and oil viscosity is less, the gauge should read a high oil pressure.  40 to 60 psi is a normal operating range.  If oil pressure drops below required level, discontinue use; check engine oil level. To release the parking brake, system air pressure normally requires 60 psi.  Some systems are split and the gauge will have two indicators.  If air pressure drops below required level the parking brakes will apply. Sometimes placed in the cab and other times on the hydraulic system by the hydraulic filter.  If the gauge shows in the red, discontinue use and contact the VCO/VCNCO. Placed in the cab or on the engine air intake system.  If the gauge shows red, remove and shake out air filter if dry type.  Reset the indicator by pushing the button on the top.  49     Figure A2.3.  Forklift System Indicators.  Display: Gauge: Description: Glow Plug Light  Actuates when the glow plug system is in use. Reading Evaluation: Depending on the system, glow plugs actuate automatically or when manually applied.  On diesel engines, for initial start utilize the glow plugs.  A2.3.   Pre-Inspection.    The  following  are  items  to  be  inspected  for  proper  operation  before operating  a  forklift.    Numbers  correlate  with  Figure  A2.4.,  which  can  be  used  as  a  forklift inspection guide for the trainee.  A2.3.1. Cleanliness/Damage/Missing Items.  A2.3.2. Leaks (fuel/oil/coolant/hydraulic/air).  A2.3.3. Fluid Levels; ensure level is within limits:  A2.3.3.1.  Engine oil.  (1)    A2.3.3.2.  Brake fluid.  (3) A2.3.3.3.  Transmission fluid.  (4) A2.3.3.4.  Hydraulic fluid.  (8)  A2.3.4. Battery; security, fluid damage and corrosion.  (2)  A2.3.5. All wheel rims (bents/dents/cracks, etc.); check for loose lug nuts.  (6)  A2.3.6. Drive belts; tension and fraying.  (7)  A2.3.7. Air restriction gauge.  (9)  A2.3.8. All tires; check for proper inflation and tread.  (11)  A2.3.9. Carriage.  (12)  A2.3.10.

Forklift Inspection Guide (1/2).       52 Figure A2.5.  Forklift Inspection Guide (2/2).     53  A2.4.   Forklift Controls.  (See) Figure A2.6. illustrates the controls the operator might find on a forklift, the numbers in the figure correspond with the discussion that follows.  Numbers align with the diagram.  Figure A2.6.  Forklift Controls.   A2.4.1. Steering Wheel, controls position of steering wheels.  (1)  A2.4.2. Steering Wheel Tilt Control, allows operator to adjust tilt of steering wheel.  (2)  A2.4.3. Direction Control Lever.  Forklifts can have from one gear in forward and reverse to four gears in each direction.  It is always best to start off in the lowest gear selection and work the gears as needed.  Always bring the forklift to a complete stop with the brakes before shifting transmission direction.  Utilize lower gears to drive down an incline, this slows the forklift down using the engine and transmission and takes less effort when braking.  (3)  A2.4.4. Parking Brake Control, engage the parking brake any time the forklift is parked or waiting.  If the park brake does not hold when parking, adjustment is necessary.  Parking brakes should hold when the forklift is sitting level and the transmission is in reverse with engine at idle  speed.    Most  hand  lever  park  brakes  can  be  adjusted  by  turning  the  end  cap  handle clockwise to tighten and counterclockwise to loosen.  For proper adjustment, apply the service brake and place the forklift in reverse, adjust the park brake until forklift is held in place solely by the parking brake.  Do not over tighten the parking brake adjustment.  When adjustment is at the maximum capacity and the forklift still does not move, contact the VCO/VCNCO, the supervisor, and/or vehicle maintenance for repairs.  (4)  54     Figure A2.7.  Parking Brake Control.   A2.4.5. Hydraulic Control Levers.  These controls can be either lever type or joystick actuated.  By manipulating these controls the hydraulics will move the load-carrying device.  Normal functions are lift, lower, and tilt.  Additional functions can be fork spread, side shift, rotate, swing, and extend.  Standard forklifts normally utilize single acting hydraulic cylinders with the lift function; meaning gravity lowers the forks.  Dual acting cylinders are used on all-terrain forklifts, these cylinders use hydraulic pressure to lower the forks, be careful not to dig into the driving surface by lowering too far.  The following are the most common hydraulic controls on  a  forklift  (it  is  recommended  the  operator  refers  to  the  operator’s  manual  for  proper operation of the controls).  (5-8)  A2.4.5.1.  Lift/Lower Control Lever (5):  Push the lever forward in order to lower the forks. The lever will return to the HOLD position when released. Pull the lever backward in order to raise the forks.  HOLD   A2.4.5.2.  Tilt Control Lever (6):   HOLD   A2.4.5.3.  Side Shift (7): HOLD      Move the lever forward in order to tilt the forks down. The lever will return to the HOLD position when released. Move the lever backward in order to tilt the forks back. Move the lever forward to shift the carriage to the left. The lever will return to the HOLD position when released. Move the lever backwards to shift the carriage to the right. 55     Move the lever to the right and forward to spread the forks. The lever will return to the HOLD position when released. Move the lever to the right and backward to close the forks.  HOLD   A2.4.5.5.  Off/On/Enrich Knob.  (9)  A2.4.5.6.  Battery  Disconnect Switch, for  routine and emergency use.   Disconnects the battery and removes power from all electrical circuits for non-use times and emergency electrical situations.  (10)  A2.4.5.7.  Accelerator Control Pedal, controls engine rpm.  (11)  A2.4.5.8.  Ignition  Switch.    Controls  electrical  current  to  forklift  functions  and  starter motor.  (12)  A2.4.5.9.  Service  Brakes/Inching  Pedal,  many  forklifts  utilize  a  clutch/inching  pedal.  During operation this foot control disengages the transmission from the engine for the first few inches of depression of the pedal and applies the brake thereafter.  This function allows the operator to maintain high engine rpm for fast operation of the load mechanism while traveling at slow speed.  This function saves wear and tear on the transmission during load movement.  Some forklifts have three pedals; the pedal to the far left is the inching pedal, the center pedal is the standard brake and the right pedal is the accelerator.  Other forklifts have just one inching/brake pedal combined.  (13)  A2.4.5.10.  Selector Switch.  Selects Gas or LPG for Bi-Fuel engines.  (14)  A2.4.5.11.  Unusual  noises.    Listen  for  any  unusual  sounds,  noises,  erratic  motions,  or vibrations.    Use  the  five  senses  to  check  for  problems  (look,  listen,  smell,  feel).    If encountered, the operator should stop the forklift and investigate the cause, if cause cannot be determined, then report to the Squadron VCO/VCNCO and/or the supervisor.  A2.4.5.12.  Listen for exhaust and air leaks.  Exhaust leaks are often confused with other sounds.    Exhaust  systems  can  leak  from  anywhere,  though  the  mating  flanges  at  the cylinders; silencer and tailpipe extensions are the usual spots.  Another typical exhaust sound is a whistle as the engine is accelerated.  For air leaks, the operator may hear the escaping of air, a continuous hissing noise.  Also, low air pressure may be an indicator there may be an air leak.  A2.4.5.4.  Fork Positioning Lever (8):     56 Attachment 3 PERFORMANCE TEST   A3.1.   Desired Learning Outcome.  A3.1.1.
