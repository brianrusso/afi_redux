Moving officers from the original attached unit or changing positions require HQAFPC/DPAJC coordination and approval.  No restrictions apply to a change in position within the sameunit of attachment, nor is coordination required.4. Using Exchange Officers During Hostilities.   During general hostilities exchange officers remainwith their unit of attachment and comply with orders received from their unit when the parent servicerecalls them.4.1. Exchange officers in units deployed on temporary active duty in support of limited hostilitiesremain with their deployed unit and comply with the operational commander’s orders until the parentservice recalls them.4.2. Operational commanders of units with exchange officers notify HQ AFPC/DPAJC by messagewhen duty location changes occur as a result of 4.1.5. Tour Lengths and Adjustments:5.1. The normal tour of duty with the USAF is 24 months, exclusive of travel and training time, withthe option of extending the tour length to 36 months if the USAF and the parent service agree.5.2. The officer submits, in writing through the attached USAF operational commander, requests fortour length adjustments.  The commander provides a recommenda-tion and forwards the request toHQ AFPC/DPAJC, 550 C Street West, Ste 32, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4734, who coordinates therequest with the appropriate service.  A tour adjustment must be completed and approved through theparent service before submitting a request for a replacement officer.6. Financial Responsibilities:6.1. Charge pay and allowances to the parent service’s appropriations.6.2. Travel costs:6.2.1. Permanent change of station (PCS) to and from the Air Force Duty Station.  The parent ser-vice publishes orders and funds the cost of travel in moving an exchange office to and from the AirForce duty station.6.2.2. PCS Moves During Tour.  The parent service publishes orders and funds a PCS move(including movement of dependents and household goods) during the time an officer is attached tothe Air Force.  HQ AFPC/DPAJC will be an information addressee on all correspondence.6.2.3. Temporary Active Duty (TDY).

Submitting Reports:27.1. Routine Personnel Reports.   Parent services usually require exchange officers to submit rou-tine personnel reports to their parent commander.  USAF commanders and supervisors normallycooperate and provide assistance in helping exchange officers prepare and submit reports.7.2. Activity Reports.   When directed, exchange officers submit activity reports to their parent com-mander through directed channels.  If channels do not include the USAF commander, the exchangeofficer provides an information copy at time of submission.Once received, the USAF commander forwards the reports through USAF channels for Air Forcereview and comment if applicable.7.3. Station Report.   A station report is a document that outlines station demographics, facilities,etc.  The in-cumbent exchange officer prepares or updates this report, and it accompanies requests forreplacement (see 22. and Attachment 1).8. Personnel Record Maintenance:8.1. The parent service has primary responsibility for maintaining attached exchange officer person-nel records.  The attached Air Force unit communicates directly with the exchange officer’s parent ser-vice unit for routine personnel information or when requiring parent service forms.8.2. As a minimum the USAF commander should maintain the following personnel records onattached exchange officers:8.2.1. DD Form 93, Record of Emergency Data.8.2.2. Health and dental treatment records.8.2.3. Individual flight records for exchange officers assigned to flying positions and who arerequired to fly or whose parent service requires flying proficiency.  The host USAF commanderassists the exchange officer in maintaining these records according to AFI 11-401, Flight Manage-ment.9. Casualty Reporting.   Follow procedures in AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services, should an exchangeofficer become a casualty.10. Fitness and Effectiveness Reports.   On receipt from the parent service, the USAF supervisor will:10.1. Using the current NAVPERS Form 1611/1, Report on the Fitness Officers, evaluate the per-formance of an attached naval exchange officer.  Before the supervisor sends the report to the Com-mander, Naval Military Personnel Command (NMPC-323), Washington DC 20350-2000, anappropriate naval officer will review it as a matter of standard procedure.  Write proof of the com-pleted review on the record copy by entering reviewed (signature, grade and title).10.2. Using the current NAVMC Form 10835, USMC Fitness Report, evaluate performance of anattached  Marine Corps exchange officer, and the next senior USAF officer in the exchange officer’sattached chain of command reviews it.  Send the report to the Performance Evaluation Branch, CodeMMPE-2, Headquarters, US Marine Corps, Washington DC 20380-0001, for administrative review.If the USAF command of attachment or chain of command does not include a US Navy or MarineCorps officer who could complete the review, then request a review from the major Naval commandfrom which the exchange officer is detached in order to complete the evaluation.310.3. Evaluate an attached Army officer’s performance on the current Department of the Army (DA)Form 67-8, Officer Evaluation Report.  The evaluation is according to the rating chain that the divi-sion to which the officer is assigned establishes in agreement with the USAF.  The division fromwhich the officer is detached completes the initial preparation of the evaluation form and then sends itto the Air Force supervisor.  For administrative review, return the form to the Army division for final-ization according to Army Regulation 623-105, Officer Evaluation Reporting System.10.4. Evaluate an attached Coast Guard (CG) officer’s performance on the current CG Form 5312(level I or level II), Officer Evaluation Report, and the next senior USAF officer in the exchangeofficer’s attached chain of command reviews it.  Use the Level I Form for grades 0-1 through 0-4.  Usethe Level II Form for grade 0-5.  Then send the report to Headquarters, US Coast Guard (G-PIM-3),2100 Second Street, SW, Washington DC 20593-0001, for administrative review.10.5. Submit problems or questions that resubmission or revision cannot resolve to the reviewingofficer with an attached memo outlining the disagreement or misunder-standing.11. Disciplining Exchange Officers.   Usually, the parent service takes disciplinary action on in the caseof exchange officers attached to Air Force units.  When nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ,is required, the parent service must administer it.  Except in narrow circumstances set forth in Rule forCourt-Martial 201 (e), an exchange officer should not be tried by a court-martial convened by an AirForce officer.  The parent service must process any exchange officer for involuntary separation from theservice.  If the exchange officer is to undergo disciplinary action, the USAF commander submits supportdocuments and a recommendation on whether or not the exchange officer should be relieved from dutieswith the USAF.  The USAF commander may use nonpunitive measures such as reprimands or admoni-tions as needed.12. Leave and Passes.   The exchange officer’s com-mander grants exchange officers leave and passesaccording to their legal entitlements and parent service directives.  The USAF commander has the author-ity to grant leave and passes and publish leave orders.  On the officer’s  return from leave, the USAF com-mander or his or her designated representative provides a copy of the leave order with departure andreturn information to the parent service administrative commander for processing and leave accounting.13. Wearing the Uniform.   Exchange officers comply with parent service directives when wearing theuniform.  In combat areas or in areas where the parent service uni-form is not appropriate for wear, theexchange officer may wear the appropriate USAF functional, organiza-tional, or special purpose uniformprovided there is no expense to the officer. Individuals wear the appropriate grade insignia of their parentservice when wearing the USAF uniform.  Exchange officers comply with USAF personal appearancestandards during their exchange tour of duty.14. Awards and Decorations.   USAF commanders may recommend interservice exchange officers foran award or decoration according to AFI 36-2803, The Air Force Awards and Decorations Program, ortheir parent service directives. Coordination between the services is essential in order to prevent duplicat-ing of the award or decoration.15. Supply Items and Issue.

Government Quarters.   The USAF provides family type or single quarters, if available, toexchange officers on the same basis it provides for its own officers as outlined in AFI 32-6001, FamilyHousing Management, and AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing Management and Operations.17. Flying Status and Facility Use.   If the parent service’s directives require an attached officer tomaintain flying proficiency, the Air Force operational commander will provide access to flying facilitiesand opportunity to fly.  The nearest USAF flight records management officer will assist the officer inmaintaining an individual flight record and information.18. Establishing Interservice Programs or Positions:18.1. New Programs.   Send new program proposals for exchanges with the USAF to HQ AFPC/DPA, 550 C Street West, Ste 32, Randolph AFB TX  78150-4734 with complete justification and thesuggested use of the USAF officer for the offset position.18.2. New Positions in an Existing Program.   Send new position proposals to HQ AFPC/DPAJC,550 C Street West, Ste 32, for coordination.  Proposals must include a proposed position descriptionAttachment 2 and a station report Attachment 1 and the interservice program contact point forexchange matters.19. Requesting Replacement Officers.   The interservice exchange officer’s USAF commander or des-ignated representative is responsible for requesting replacement exchange officers.  The Air Force unitforwards replacement requests and position descriptions through  its respective major command (MAJ-COM) to HQ AFPC/DPAJC, 550 C Street West, Ste 32, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4732.  Requests mustarrive at AFPC 180 calendar days before the 1st day of the month in which the incumbent completes theexchange tour.  Use attachment 2 when requesting replacement officers.20. Notifying Inbound Exchange Officers.    HQ AFPC/DPAJC receives the name, grade, and servicenumber of each inbound officer from the appropriate interservice program contact point along with acareer brief or resume of the inbound officer’s qualifications and duty history.  Once obtained, the infor-mation is sent to the attached officer’s gaining Air Force MAJCOM and unit.  The unit uses this informa-tion to make appropriate arrangements for the officer’s impending arrival.  Make every effort to get theofficer quickly settled into his or her new environment and exchange officer duties.21. Detaching Exchange Officers.   When the exchange officer completes his or her tour, the parent ser-vice publishes orders reassigning or detaching the exchange officer from the USAF.22. Station Reports.   The incumbent exchange officer prepares a station report (see attachment 1) andsubmits it in two copies to the attached USAF commander or designated representative as part of thereplacement exchange officer request.  Base or post brochures are not acceptable substitutes for the  sta-tion  report  require-ment.  Forward a copy of the station report to the parent service for its use.EUGENE E. HABIGER,  Lt General, USAFDCS/Personnel5Attachment 1SAMPLE STATION REPORTA1.1. Attach two copies of the station report to the requisition for a replacement officer.
