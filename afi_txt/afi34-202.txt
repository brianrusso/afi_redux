Introduction.  AFPD  65-2,  Managers’  Internal  Control  Program,  and  AFI  65-201, Managers’  Internal  Control  Program  Procedures,  require  all  Air  Force  (AF)  organizations establish a cost-effective Internal ManagementControl (IMC) Program to protect resources.  This instruction  explains  the  controlling  process  and  outlines  procedures  for  the  control,  protection, and  loss  prevention  of  cash  and  other  NAF  assets  according  to  AFPD  34-2,  Managing Nonappropriated Funds.  AF NAFIs described in AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds, must  establish  and  adhere  to  the  internal  control  procedures  in  this  instruction.    Additional guidelines for Services programs  and procedures  can be found under Financial Management  in the  Financial  Training  Aids the  AF  Services  website:  https://www.usafservices.com  (T-0) located section on 1.2.  Custodian  Responsibilities.  The  custodian  provides  direction  and  assistance  for  the protection of NAFI assets.  This instruction refers to the custodian as the resource manager (RM) unless  otherwise  specified.    At  installation-level,  the  RM  is  the  single  custodian  for  all  NAF assets, unless another individual is appointed in accordance with  AFI 34-201. 1.2.1.  Obligation  of  funds.    Although  RMs  may  delegate  certain  responsibilities  such  as obligating NAFs, they remain responsible for the propriety and accountability of each action.  The  RM  or  designee  must  ensure  present  and  future  revenues  will  cover  all  financial obligations  before  authorizing  funds.    The  AF  may  hold  RMs  liable  and  accountable  for NAFI  losses  or  unauthorized  obligations,  and  for  all  delegated  responsibilities  and  actions.  (T-0) 1.2.2.  Accounting  Systems  and  Procedures.    The  RM  verifies  accounting  procedures  are according to AFI 34-209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting. 1.2.3.  Internal  Control  Procedures.    The  RM  ensures  managers  implement  internal  control procedures for protection of NAFI assets. 1.3.  Forms.  Air  Force  Installation  and  Mission  Support  Center,  Air  Force  Services  Activity, Financial  Management  and  Comptroller  Directorate  (AFSVA/FM),  Financial  Services  Branch (AFSVA/FMNF),  approves  requests  for  changes  to  AF  forms  defined  in  this  instruction.    The Force  Support  Squadron  (FSS)  may  automate  AF  and  NAF  forms  if  the  form  content  and requirements are not changed.  If any application/system has a validated Common Access Card (CAC)  enabled  electronic  signature  which the application/system    may  be  deemed  a  system  of  record.    The  system  is  then  used  to  store  the electronic and paper copies until no longer required. the  place  of  a  wet  signature, takes 1.4.  Disposition  of  Records.  Ensure  all  records  created  as  a  result  of  processes  prescribed  in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located  in  the  Air  Force  Records  Information  Management  System  (AFRIMS).  Dispose  of Privacy  Act  records  promptly  according  to  AFI  33-332,  Air  Force  Privacy  and  Civil  Liberties Program. 8 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 1.5.  Supplements.  AFSVA/FM  reviews  and  approves/disapproves  proposed  installation-level supplements. 1.6.  Technical  Assistance.  Send  requests  for  clarification  or  interpretation  of  this  manual  to AFSVA/FM. 1.7.  Waivers.  Activity and functional managers may request waivers to the procedures required by this instruction.  Substantial justification must accompany all requests for waivers.  There are two types of waivers: 1.7.1.  Local  Waivers.  Local  waivers  are  submitted  through  the  fund  custodian  to  the installation commander for approval as described in this publication. 1.7.2.  The FSS commander or director reviews all waivers annually and when circumstances change, determine if the waiver is still required.  The FSS commander or director documents waiver  review  and  briefs  NAF  Council  on  results.    It  is  not  necessary  to  seek  approval  for waivers deemed valid in the annual review.  1.7.3.  Other  Waivers.  The  custodian  or  FSS  commander  or  director  submits  waiver requests  to  AFSVA/FM  for  circumstances  that  do  not  permit  local  waivers.    Approved waivers may be valid for a period up to 3 years. 1.7.4.  Each waiver request, whether granted locally or requiring submission to AFSVA/FM must: 1.7.4.1.  Outline the issue/problem. 1.7.4.2.  Identify the specific policy requiring a waiver. 1.7.4.3.  Identify how the waiver provides a solution, and 1.7.4.4.  Provide justification why the waiver should be approved. 1.7.5.  Waivers  to  this  instruction  are  not  valid  without  a  control  number  assigned  by  the approving authority.  1.7.6.  The  RM  maintains  documentation  on  waivers,  including  reviews  of  waivers,  in  the life-of-the-fund (LOF) file.  Requests to extend waivers may be submitted to AFSVA/FM for review via email.  The approved extension must be attached to the original waiver in the life-of-the-fund file.  AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 9 Chapter 2 THE CONTROLLING PROCESS 2.1.  Definition of Internal Control.  All AF organizations must use a cost-effective Managers’ Internal  Control  (MIC)  program  to  protect  resources.    Internal  control  procedures  apply  to  all operation and mission responsibilities and are not limited to financial matters.  See AFPD 65-2, Managers’  Internal  Control  Program,  and  AFI  65-201,  Managers’  Internal  Control  Program Procedures.  Internal control is a plan of organization and all the methods and measures used to: 2.1.1.  Safeguard resources. 2.1.2.  Assure accuracy and reliability of information. 2.1.3.  Assure adherence to applicable laws, regulations and policies, instructions, and 2.1.4.  Promote operational economy and efficiency. 2.2.  Organizational  Structure.  Controls apply to all aspects contributing to the existence and well-being  of  an  organization.    An  effective  internal  control  plan  requires  each  NAFI's organizational  structure  provide  clear  lines  of  authority  and  responsibility  to  ensure  no  single individual controls a transaction from beginning to end.  This separation of duties protects assets and  provides  a  cross-check  promoting  accuracy  without  duplication.    By  comparing  recorded accountability to actual existing assets, variances can be readily identified and resolved.  (In this example  an  asset  refers  to  something  of  value  to  the  NAFI,  not  simply  a  fixed  asset).    A separation of duties provides a division among: 2.2.1.  The initiation and authorization of a transaction. 2.2.2.  The recording of a transaction. 2.2.3.  The custody of the asset. 2.3.  The  Controlling  Process.  To achieve effective internal control requires an understanding of the controlling process.  The controlling process includes two steps; the degree of control and internal control standards. 2.3.1.  The  Degree  of  Control.  The  first  step  of  the  controlling  process  is  determining  the amount  or  degree  of  control  required  for  adequate  protection  of  assets.    This  step  involves several factors: 2.3.1.1.  The  first  factor  is  motivating  and  controlling  people.    People  are  the  key  to  an effective  internal  control  system.    Activity  and  functional  managers  hire  and  retain competent  personnel,  and  train  and  motivate  them  to  understand  what  they  have  to  do, appreciate why they must do it, and agree it must be done. 2.3.1.2.  The  second  factor  involves  determining  risk,  error,  or  irregularity.    One  must determine risk before it can be controlled.  "Control risk" is the risk of having too little or too much control as it relates to management's responsibilities to safeguard assets.  Once the activity or functional manager identifies a risk, he or she determines whether it should or can be controlled.  For example, cash and items readily converted into cash are more at risk and need more controls than equipment. 10 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 2.3.1.3.  The  third  factor  involves  determining  the  probability  of  error  or  irregularity.  Determining  risk  also  considers  the  probability  of  loss  rather  than  the  possibility.  Controls  can  reduce  the  probability,  but  rarely  eliminate  the  possibility.    A  manager's responsibility  to  safeguard  assets  requires  they  be  adequately  protected  and  controlled.  However,  the  manager  must  also  weigh  the  controls  to  ensure  they  do  not  hamper  the productivity by the controls implemented for any asset.  Contact the Security Forces (SF) crime prevention section for a survey of physical security risks. 2.3.1.4.  The fourth factor is achieving reasonable assurance of prevention or detection of errors  or  irregularities.    The  cost  of  control  should  not  exceed  the  anticipated  benefits.  Activity and functional managers can usually estimate the direct cost of a specific control as  it  usually  involves  known  factors  such  as  extra  equipment  or  additional  personnel.  Effectiveness is more difficult to determine.  If an error or risk situation arises, managers must  determine  if  the  control  being  considered  will  actually  prevent  or  detect  the occurrence.    Weighing  the  indirect  costs  and  benefits  is  the  most  difficult.    Before implementing  the  control,  managers  must  determine  if  the  new  control  restricts operations to  the extent losses are  greater than the assets at  risk.  Reasonable assurance recognizes  determining  these  factors  require  estimates  and  judgments  on  the  part  of management. 2.3.1.5.  The  fifth  factor  recognizes  inherent  limitations.    To  fully  consider  the effectiveness  of  internal  controls,  managers  must  recognize  the  following  inherent limitations:  2.3.1.5.1.  People.    People  operate  the  system  and  represent  the  major  limitation  in any  control  system   Faulty  personal  performance  may  result  from  a misunderstanding of instructions, mistake in judgment, distraction, fatigue, or simple carelessness. . 2.3.1.5.2.  Circumvention or Collusion.  Whenever internal control relies on the work of  one  person  being  checked  by  another,  there  is  always  a  risk  of  circumvention  or collusion which can reduce or destroy the effectiveness of those procedures. 2.3.1.5.3.  Control Override.  Procedures can be overridden in certain circumstances.  The most notable are bypasses by higher level managers or subordinates under their orders, of controls implemented to monitor the occurrence of errors or irregularities. 2.3.1.5.4.  Changing  Circumstances.    Factors  external  to  the  organization  such  as commercial  and  political  forces  are  always  changing,  and  internal  factors  such  as changes  in  operations,  systems,  or  people  involved  can  occur  without  conscious  or complete  planning.    Accordingly,  the  effectiveness  of  controls  may  be  constantly changing and future periods are subject to the risks arising from these changes. 2.3.2.  Internal  Control  Standards.    The  second  step  in  the  controlling  process  requires activity  and  functional  managers  implement  internal  control  standards  in  AF  directives.  These  standards  define  the  minimum  level  of  quality  acceptable  for  an  internal  control system  and  comprise  the  criteria  against  which  all  systems  are  to  be  evaluated.    There  are three  types  of  internal  control  standards;  general,  specific,  and  resolution  standards.    The following are general standards: AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 11 2.3.2.1.  Reasonable  Assurance.    This  standard  recognizes  the  objectives  of  the  systems are  accomplished,  and  the  cost  of  internal  control  and  security  does  not  exceed  the benefits derived. 2.3.2.2.  Supportive Attitude.  Attitude affects the quality of internal controls.  Managers must demonstrate commitment to achieving strong internal controls through their actions concerning  organization,  personnel  practices,  communication,  protection,  and  use  of resources  through  systematic  accountability,  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  general leadership.    Adequate  supervision,  training,  and  motivation  of  employees  in  the  area  of internal  controls  are  vital  to  maintaining  and  demonstrating  a  positive  and  supportive attitude toward internal controls at all times. 2.3.2.3.  Competent  Personnel.    Managers  and  employees  must  possess  personal  and professional  integrity  and  maintain  a  level  of  competence  allowing  them  to  accomplish their  assigned  duties  and  understand  the  importance  of  developing  and  implementing good internal controls. 2.3.2.4.  Control  Objectives.    Internal  control  objectives  (desired  outcomes)  should  be logical,  applicable,  and  reasonably  complete.    This  standard  requires  managers  tailor objectives to operations.  Complying with this standard requires the manager to identify functions  within  the  activity,  or  program,  and  analyze  each  in  detail  to  ensure  control objectives are met. 2.3.2.5.  Control Techniques.  These are used to accomplish control objectives and should be  effective  and  efficient  to  continually  provide  a  high  degree  of  assurance  the  internal control  objectives  are  being  achieved.    Examples  are  specific  policies,  procedures, organization plans such as separation of duties, and physical arrangements such as locks and alarms. 2.3.3.  The following are specific standards: 2.3.3.1.  Documentation.  Internal control procedures and all transactions must be clearly documented and fully support the transaction.  Documentation must be readily available and accessible for examination. 2.3.3.2.  Recording  Transactions  and  Events.    Accounting  for  NAFIs  ensures  all transactions and other significant events are promptly recorded and properly classified to maintain  pertinent,  relevant,  and  valuable  information  used  to  control  operations  and make decisions. 2.3.3.3.  Execution of Transactions and Events.  Managers ensure transactions and other significant events are authorized and executed only by persons acting within the scope of their authority. 2.3.3.4.  Separation of  Duties.  To reduce the risk of non-detection, managers ensure no one  individual  controls  all  key  aspects  of  a  transaction  or  event.    Separate  among individuals,  key  duties  and  responsibilities  in  authorizing,  processing,  recording,  and reviewing transactions to ensure effective checks and balances. 2.3.3.5.  Supervision.  Supervision requires supervisors continuously review and approve their  staffs'  assigned  work  to  assure  achievement  of  internal  control  objectives;  and 12 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 provide  guidance  and training to  their staffs to  minimize errors, waste, and/or wrongful acts. 2.3.3.6.  Access to and Accountability for Resources.  Managers limit access to resources and records to  authorized individuals.  Managers assign and maintain accountability for the custody and use of resources to reduce the risk of unauthorized use or loss. 2.3.4.  The  resolution  standard  requires  activity  and  functional  managers  take  prompt, responsive  action  on  all  identified  internal  control  findings  and  recommendations.  Activity and  functional  managers  must  correct  deficiencies,  produce  improvements,  demonstrate  the findings and recommendations are either invalid, or do not warrant further action. 2.3.4.1.  Evaluate  and  test  performance  against  standards.    Activity  and  functional managers perform and document a self-inspection/assessment of their activity or function at  least  annually  to  determine  if  required  internal  control  procedures  have  been implemented  and  are  functioning  effectively.    This  review  consists  of  two  parts:  evaluation and testing. 2.3.4.1.1.  Evaluation determines whether a control exists, what established it, if it is adequate,  and  if  any  controls  are  excessive  and  uneconomical  for  the  function's inherent risk exposure. 2.3.4.1.2.  Testing  determines  whether  the  control  is  functioning  as  intended  and ensures it is effective in minimizing the risk exposure it was designed to control. 2.3.4.2.  Activity and functional managers document the results of the managers’ internal control  reviews  (MICR).    This  documentation  contains  information  which  includes whether  the  internal  control  standards  are  met,  identifies  any  weaknesses,  identifies excessive  controls  contributing  to  a  lack  of  economy  or  efficiency,  and  states  the corrective  action  taken  or  pending  to  resolve  any  discovered  internal  control  weakness.  Following an MICR, inspection, or audit report, activity and functional managers: 2.3.4.2.1.  Immediately correct any regulatory compliance deficiencies and resolve all noted internal control deficiencies identified. 2.3.4.2.2.  Provide  appropriate  feedback.    Advise  the  MICR  program  focal  point (refer to paragraph 2.6), RM, FSS commander or director, and any other installation NAFI  activities  of  the  results  of  the  self-inspection/assessment;  include  common findings,  weaknesses  and  any  unfavorable  trends.   As  appropriate,  provide information to the applicable NAF oversight office. 2.4.  Internal  Control  Objectives.  Internal  controls  must  provide  reasonable  assurance  the following internal control objectives are achieved: 2.4.1.  Obligations and costs comply with applicable directives. 2.4.2.  All assets are safeguarded against mismanagement, waste, loss, unauthorized use, and misappropriation. 2.4.3.  Revenues and expenditures of operations  are recorded and accounted for properly to prepare reliable financial and statistical reports, and maintain accountability of assets. 2.4.4.  Resources are effectively and efficiently managed. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 13 2.5.  Internal  Control  Training.  The  RM  ensures  managers  implement  internal  control procedures for protection of NAFI assets.  training  module 2.5.1.  Activity  managers  must  include  the  web-based  NAF  Internal  Controls  Training requirement  in  their  self-inspection  checklist  and  local  operating  instructions.    The  web-based the  Force  Support  Knowledge  Center, https://fskc.csd.disa.mil  for  all  military  and  civilian  employees  directly  involved  in  the handling of NAF funds  or control of specific NAF assets, and those who have oversight  of these employees.  They must complete the web-based NAF Internal Controls Training within 30 days of hire or assignment and subsequent annual refresher training.  (T-0) is  available  via 2.5.2.  FSS unit training managers will document the training, and ensure the training module is  available  to  employees  not  able  to  access  the  Force  Support  Knowledge  Center  on-line training. 2.5.3.  Activity  managers  include  the  training  requirement  in  the  activity  self-inspection checklist and local operating instructions. 2.6.  Managers’ Internal Control Review (MICR) Program.  The FSS commander or director appoints  a  focal  point  to  administer  the  MICR  Program.    Commanders  and  managers  at  every level of the AF must establish, evaluate, improve, and report on internal controls.  The AFSVA Commander,  installation  commander,  FSS  commander  or  director  may  direct  a  local  internal control review in any NAF area  (T-0). 2.6.1.  The FSS commander or director  also  ensures managers  and NAF  Accounting Office (NAF  AO)  personnel  are  familiar  with  the  conduct  and  ethical  standards  prescribed  by  the Joint Ethics Regulation (JER) DOD 5500.7-R.   Activity  and 2.6.2.  Activity  and  functional  managers  implement  internal  controls  specified  in  Air  Force directives. functional  managers  perform  and  document  a  self-inspection/assessment  of their activity or function at  least annually to  determine if  required internal  control  procedures  have  been  implemented  and  are  functioning  effectively.    If required,  implement  additional  internal  controls.    Activity  and  functional  managers immediately  correct  any  regulatory  compliance  deficiencies  identified  in  internal  review reports (MICRs, inspections and audits, etc.). 2.6.3.  The  focal  point  ensures  all  activity  managers  and  functional  managers  of  unit-level NAFI  operations  and  functions  conducts  MICRs  of  their  assessable  units  and  functions.  Manager MICRs are in  addition to any AF directed MICRs or any other MICRs conducted by the NAF Financial Analyst (NAFFA).  Each assessable unit uses these MICRs, audits, and inspections as the basis for preparing the Annual Statement of Assurance for their activity or function. 2.6.4.  The  RM  as  custodian  (and  as  MICR  Program  focal  point,  if  appointed)  prepares, directs, and reviews MICRs. 2.6.5.  The FSS focal point reviews all MICRs, including those conducted by the NAFFA in accordance  with  AFI  65-107,  Nonappropriated  Funds  Financial  Management  Oversight Responsibilities. 2.6.6.  The FSS focal point reviews other AF directed agency audits and reviews. 14 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 2.6.7.  The FSS focal point evaluates internal control programs to ensure they provide for an effective organization, operation, and protection against fraud by: 2.6.7.1.  Allocating  responsibility  so  no  single  individual  has  exclusive  control  over  all phases of a transaction.  2.6.7.2.  The RM may permit small operations (an activity with total revenue of less than $12,000 a year and relatively few personnel) to operate under these circumstances.  The RM identifies these activities in writing and retains the appropriate documentation in the NAFI LOF file.  The RM conducts a review, at least annually, to determine if conditions have changed and the authorization is no longer required. 2.6.7.3.  Documenting the review. 2.6.7.4.  Providing continuous managerial review at all echelons of responsibility. 2.6.7.5.  Establishing a clear functional line of responsibility and authority. 2.6.7.6.  Ensuring a clearly defined position descriptions exist for all NAFI employees. 2.7.  MICR  Program  Responsibilities.  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  Financial Management  for  Financial  Operations  (SAF/FMF)  is  the  focal  point  for  the  AF  Internal Management  Program.    SAF/FMF  designates  primary  reporting  elements  and  internal  control officials according to AFI 65-201, Managers’ Internal Control Program Procedures.  Annually, SAF/FMF  tasks  all  MAJCOM,  Field  Operating  Agency  (FOA),  and  Direct  Reporting  Unit (DRU) Commanders to prepare and submit the Annual Statement of Assurance. 2.7.1.  MAJCOM/Commanders  (CCs)  identify  the  assessable  units  within  their  command (i.e.,  MAJCOM  divisions  and  installations)  to  evaluate  for  the  Annual  Statement  of Assurance, and appoint a focal point to administer the MICR Program.  The MAJCOM/CCs, through  the  focal  points,  ensure  all  MAJCOM-level  division  chiefs  and  field  installation commanders, including FSS operations, implement the AF MICR Program. 2.7.2.  If the annual report identifies an FSS related weakness, the MAJCOM/CC forwards a copy  to  AFSVA/SV  and  Headquarters  United  States  Air  Force,  Director  of  Services  (HQ USAF/A1S). 2.7.3.  Installation commanders identify the assessable units within their command (normally squadrons), and appoint an installation focal point (normally the Financial Manager (FM)) to administer the MICR Program.    Installation commanders, through their focal  point, comply with all requirements of AFI 65-201 and MAJCOM MICR Program initiatives. 2.7.4.  The  installation  focal  point  tasks  assessable  units  including  the  FSS/CC  or  Civilian Leader  (CL)  to  identify  their  assessable  units  (e.g.,  flight,  unit,  branch,  activity,  etc.)  and appoint  a  focal  point  (this  may  be  the  RM)  to  administer  the  MICR  Program.    The  FSS commander also ensures managers and NAF AO personnel are familiar with the conduct and ethical standards prescribed in DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER). 2.7.5.  The  FSS  focal  point  ensures  all  activity  managers  and  functional  managers  of  unit-level NAFI operations and functions conduct MICRs of their assessable units and functions. 2.7.6.  Quarterly,  the  FSS  focal  point  evaluates  the  number  and  type  (directed,  special,  and recurring)  of  evaluations  and  reviews  performed  for  the  assessable  units  according  to  the MICR Program plan. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 15 2.7.7.  Each assessable unit uses these MICRs, audits, inspections, and other reviews as the basis  for  preparing  the  Annual  Statement  of  Assurance  for  their  activity  or  function.  Managers may use a comprehensive self-inspection/assessment checklist as an alternative to MICRs if not Air Force directed.  See AFI 65-201. 2.8.  Internal Management Control Reviews of Off-Base NAF Operations.  The RM obtains appropriated funds Temporary Duty (TDY) support for the FSS focal point to conduct reviews of off-base NAF operations the local FSS supports under a host-tenant agreement.  The reviewing team normally includes the FSS focal point and any other personnel from within FSS operations or the NAF AO to augment the team.  Authorized IAW AFI 65-106 as part of Executive Control and Command Supervision (ECCS). 16 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 3 PHYSICAL SAFEGUARDS 3.1.  Protection  of  Cash.  Everyone  responsible  for  or  directly  concerned  with  the  security  of NAF  resources  must  use  instruction,  AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense  ,  and  the  installation Integrated  Defense  Plan  (IDP).    The  Defense  Force  Commander  (DFC)  may  provide  guidance for  funds  storage  limits  and  general  resource  protection  information.    The  Integrated  Defense Council (IDC), SF and other responsible agencies may provide staff and operational assistance if the  funds  stored  in  applicable  activities  meet  current  thresholds  for  their  coordination.    The current  threshold  for  an  annual  site  survey  by  the  installation  SF,  SF  Resource  Protection Program  (RPP),  RPP  Manager  is  $100,000.    For  funds  facilities  storing  $100,000  or  more,  the owning  unit  will  conduct  surveys  annually.    Funds  facilities  storing  or  maintaining  less  than $100,000 are exempt from  survey requirements.   Survey reports may be  completed on a single building, facility, room, site, Geographically Separated Unit (GSU), or an entire installation.  As a  minimum,  survey  reports  must  include  compliance  with  physical  security  standards, administrative records  (e.g., inventories key and lock custodians), assessment  of non-duty hour and/or  nighttime  security  standards,  circulation  control  assessment,  operating  instructions, personnel initial and re-occurring training.  For facilities maintaining less than $100,000, while not  subject  to  an  annual  survey  by  AFI  31-101,  care  and  consideration  needs  to  be  given  to proper funds storage.  Contact  your local SF squadron or DFC to obtain the pertinent guidance  (T-0). 3.1.1.  The RM approves adequate safeguards for the protection of cash and ensures: 3.1.1.1.  There are written operating instructions (OI) used for handling and safeguarding cash.    OIs  must  also  include  procedures  to  follow  when  installed  duress  alarm  systems fail. 3.1.1.2.  Only  authorized  personnel  are  permitted  access  to  cash  or  cash  equivalents, including those in locked containers or stored in safes. 3.1.1.3.  Individuals  sign  receipts  to  establish  accountability  for  cash  and  property transferred to their custody. 3.1.1.4.  Individuals  do  not  store  or  commingle  personal  funds  with  NAF  cash,  even  if separate containers are used. 3.1.1.5.  Cash is not stored in a safe designated for classified material. 3.2.  Funds Storage Limits.  The installation commander approves fund storage limits based on the  advice  and  guidance  of  the  DFC  and  local  IDP  guidelines.    Facilities  storing  $100,000  or more will comply with AFI 31-101.  The NAF AO and activity keep a record of all fund storage limits in the LOF. 3.3.  Funds  Containers.  Activities use General  Services Administration (GSA) approved safes for temporary unattended storage of cash assets awaiting bank deposit, or for overnight storage of  change  funds  for  the  next  day's  activities.    Funds  custodians  must  ensure  containers  used  to store  government  funds  are  certified  as  to  their  capability  to  protect  funds.    These  containers must  be  GSA  approved  for  funds  storage.    If  the  container  does  not  meet  GSA  specifications, ensure  it  has  an  Underwriters  Laboratory  (UL)  label  (or  foreign  equivalent)  designating  it  as  a AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 17 burglar-resistant  safe.    If  necessary,  seek  advice  from  the  local  SF  squadron.    The  activity manager  or  designee  must  be  present,  in  a  position  of  effective  safeguard,  when  a  safe  is  left open for temporary access to cash assets. (T-0) 3.3.1.  Standard  Form  702,  Security  Container  Check  sheet    is  available  on-line  via http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/115582  to  document  access  of  the  safe.  Record  access  (opening/closure)  each  time  the  safe  is  accessed  or  locked  throughout  the business day, and not just at start and end of shift or business day.  The form is secured to the exterior of the safe.  3.3.2.  Funds  Container  and  Safe  Combinations.    Control  the  funds’  container  combination and restrict it to the minimum number of persons.  As a minimum, change the combination at least  annually,  when  transferring,  discharging,  separating,  or  reassigning  an  individual  who has access to the container, and when directed by the installation’s IDC. 3.3.2.1.  Use a locally devised form, in two parts to store the safe combination, document the combination change, and list the individuals with access to the safe.  Prepare a new form each time the combination is changed.  Attach one part of the form to the inside of the container.  Maintain a sealed envelope with the other part in a locked container in a different secure location (usually the NAF AO, but it doesn’t have to be). 3.4.  Funds Storage Rooms.  A funds storage room is a space specially selected for containing a funds storage container during non-operating hours.  For dollar thresholds see paragraph 3.1.  Per AFI  31-101,  paragraph  8.4.4.9,  the  following  criteria  are  considered  minimum  requirements:  Doors will be constructed of 1 ¾ inch solid or laminated wood with U.S. 12-gauge steel plate on the outside face; or standard 1 ¾ inch hollow metal, industrial type construction with minimum U.S.  14-gauge  skin  plate  thickness,  internally  reinforced  vertically  with  continuous  steel stiffeners spaced 6 inches maximum on center.  Door bucks, frames, and keepers will be rigidly anchored  and provided  with  anti-spread space filler reinforcement to  prevent  disengagement of the lock bolt by prying or jacking the door frame.  Also, the frames and locks for both interior and exterior doors will be designed and installed to prevent removal of the frame which faces the built-in  locking  mechanism.  Frames  must  also  be  designed  to  prevent  spreading  sufficiently  to disengage  the  lock  bolt  from  outside  the  protected  room  when  the  door  is  closed  and  locked.  Construction requirements for doorframes and thresholds must be exacting as those for the door.  For example, where metal doors are used, the frame and thresholds must also be metal.  A Class 5 steel vault door with a changeable combination may be used instead of other doors and locks.  When choosing the proper type of hinge for secure area doors, apply the following criteria:  The hinge must be strong enough to  withstand the rigors of constant  use and the unusual  weight  of the  door.    Hinges  will  have  fixed  pins.    Exposed  hinges  will  be  peened,  or  spot  welded,  or otherwise protected to prevent removal. 3.5.  Funds  Escort  Procedures.  Funds  escort  procedures  are  determined  by  the  IDC  and published  in  the  IDP.    When  needed,  FSS  facilities  are  encouraged  to  contract  with  security escort providers, when it is cost effective and warranted by the risk presented. 3.6.  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).  Refer to paragraph 3.1. 3.7.  Cashier  Area.  The  cashier  area  serves  two  purposes:    identification  and  security.    It  is designed to tell customers where to get service, protect funds and related documents and forms while in the care of the general cashier, and reduce interference by other personnel.  To ensure 18 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 the  area  is  secure  and  unauthorized  individuals  do  not  have  access  to  the  activity’s  general cashier  and  other  cashier  check-cashing  areas  (for  example,  club  cashier  cages),  the  activity manager: 3.7.1.  Posts signs outside of the area reading, "Authorized Personnel Only."  3.7.2.  Posts a list  of individuals authorized access  to  the area inside the  cashier area.   This requirement is in addition to signs required by AFI 31-101, for controlled areas in facilities maintaining $100,000 or more, or other controlled areas as designated by the IDC. 3.7.3.  Ensures the entrance is locked at all times using a key or an electronically controlled lock entry. 3.7.4.  Ensures  the  cashier’s  area  contains  one  or  more  locking  cash  drawers  with  one  or more authorized safes. 3.7.5.  Ensures the cashier area has at least one cashier window. 3.7.6.  Ensures use of the work area exclusively for cashier activities.  Ensures the work area is large enough to segregate general cashier funds from check-cashing cashier funds. 3.7.7.  Equips cashier work areas with emergency lighting. 3.7.8.  Ensures  a  secure  place  is  available  where  other  cashiers  pick  up  their  change  funds, turn in their receipts, and complete AF Form 1875, NAF Individual Cashier's Report. 3.7.9.  Conducts a security  check of the cashier area upon closing and ensures all funds are properly deposited or stored and all documents and forms are properly secured.  The manager may designate another individual to perform this function. 3.8.  Cashiers' Responsibilities.  Before leaving the work area, cashiers: 3.8.1.  Secure documents and forms in a locked safe or drawer and secure the entrance to the cashier's cage if leaving the general cashier area.  If the cashier is being relieved or departing the  area,  he  or  she  must  pass  on  or  secure  the  funds,  documents,  forms,  and  cashier's  cage according  to  local  cash  control  OIs.    The  transfer  (pass  on)  of  funds  must  be  documented with the amount being transferred and written signatures from the transferring and receiving individuals  (T-0). 3.9.  Cash Registers.  Use cash registers in activities where the volume of regular cash receipts is $1,000 or more per month.  Activities with cash receipts less than $1,000 per month may use a locking cashbox.  Do not use cash registers to store cash during non-operating hours.  Store cash during  non-operating  hours  in  a  locked  safe  or  other  secure  storage  area  according  to  AFI  31-101.  (T-0) 3.9.1.  Managers  must  observe  cash  registers  and  cashboxes  to  be  sure  they  are  secure  and unauthorized people cannot gain access to them when they contain cash. 3.9.2.  Cash register drawers will be left open and empty when the register is not in use.  This is to prevent unnecessary damage in the event of attempted theft or burglary. 3.9.3.  Managers ensure cashiers receive training on required internal control procedures and perform their duties according to established OIs. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 19 3.9.3.1.  All  cashiers  as  well  as  all  oversight  and  supervisory  individuals  complete  the mandatory initial  and annual  refresher internal  control training module through the  FSS training manager.  (See Chapter 2.) 3.9.4.  Cashiers  ring  up  each  sale  in  view  of  the  customer  and  give  the  customer  a  register receipt.  The receipt may be a register "kick-out" tape, guest check, or other customer receipt media. 3.9.4.1.  The requirement to  provide the customer with  a  receipt (kick-out tape) may be waived  locally  according  to  AFI  34-201.    Before  requesting  a  local  waiver,  managers must consider the following factors: 3.9.4.1.1.  Location  of  the  cash  register;  it  must  permit  a  visual  display  to  the customer. 3.9.4.1.2.  Descriptive or visual display features of the equipment. 3.9.4.1.3.  Provide an alternate means of satisfying customers’ receipt requests. 3.9.4.1.4.  Opportunity for cash register manipulation; over, short and no sale rings. 3.9.4.2.  No receipt at point-of-sale for credit card sales $25 or less.  Activities interested in  speeding  up  check-out  and  facilitating  customer  service  should  consider  this  option.  Ensure  customers  are  asked  whether  they  would  like  a  receipt  or  not.    Remember  to contact  AFSVA/FM  for  the  proper  re-programming  of  your  swipe  terminal  before beginning this procedure. 3.9.5.  Cashiers  must  not  adjust  an  incorrectly  rung  sale  on  a  subsequent  sale.    Managers instruct cashiers to account for an error using AF Form 645, NAF Cash Register Adjustment; annotate  the  cash  register  tape  to  flag  the  error;  and  attach  the  AF  Form  645  to  AF  Form 1875. 3.9.5.1.  Point-of-Sale  (POS)  systems  require  managers  or  designees  use  a  restricted passcode  to  authorize  system  voids  for  completed  sales  transactions  (or  over  rings).  Cashiers must complete AF Form 645 for POS voids and over rings in the absence of a manager or designee assigned the restricted pass code.  The RM ensures void procedures are clearly stated in local operating instructions. 3.9.6.  In  most  instances,  no  more  than  one  cashier  must  work  out  of  a  single  cash  register drawer.  However, this is permitted in small activities (total annual revenue under $12,000, with  relatively  few  personnel),  or  on  an  exceptional  case-by-case  basis  in  larger  activities when necessary in the interest of customer service.  Blanket designations are not authorized.  (T-3) 3.9.6.1.  The RM designates, in writing, those activities authorized to operate with more than  one  cashier  per  drawer  with  adequate  controls  to  safeguard  funds  and  provide  a satisfactory audit trail of accountability. 3.9.6.2.  The RM approves an activity-specific OI to ensure internal control of cash when more than one cashier operates from a single drawer.  Keep written authorization at the activity and file a copy in the NAF AO maintained LOF file. 20 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 3.9.6.3.  Conduct  a  review,  at  least  annually,  in  each  authorized  activity  to  determine  if conditions  have  changed  and  the  authorization  is  no  longer  required.    Document  the review. 3.9.7.  The activity manager controls cash register reset and read keys. 3.9.7.1.  The  activity  manager  ensures  operators  do  not  reset  registers.    Resetting  of period  cumulative  totals  (e.g.,  daily,  weekly)  is  permitted  if  the  register  is  so  equipped and if the cumulative journal register is not reset. 3.9.7.2.  The  activity  manager  limits  access  to  reset  ("Z")  keys  or  reset  function  (e.g., passcodes  used  with  password-protected  software  for  Point-of-Sale  systems)  to supervisory personnel responsible for preparing registers for the next day's business. 3.9.7.3.  The activity manager tags reset keys not needed to read or lock the register, and then forwards to the custodian for safekeeping. 3.9.7.4.  The manager or designee controls the read keys or passcodes and limits access to read ("X") keys and passcodes to  supervisors, head cashiers, and other staff performing cashier shift changes during a business day. 3.9.7.5.  The  activity  manager  or  designee  ensures  cashiers,  including  window  or specially  designated  cashiers,  never  possess  read  keys  or  passcodes  unless  necessary  to operate the register.  Operations in which management is not always available (e.g., 24-hour  lodging  operations)  may  want  to  apply  for  a  local  waiver  to  permit  the  incoming cashier use of the read key to ring out the outgoing cashier and subsequently pass the key to  each  succeeding  incoming  cashier.    Before  requesting  a  local  waiver,  be  sure  to consider the following important factors: 3.9.7.5.1.  The size of the operation and volume of business receipts involved. 3.9.7.5.2.  Potential  risks  involved  in  permitting  cashiers  to  verify  receipts  and determine cash over or short before turn-in. 3.9.7.5.3.  Other duties of cashiers. 3.9.7.5.4.  Requirement for an alternative internal control procedure. 3.9.8.  At the end of each shift, the activity manager or designee reads cash registers, writes the register identification and date on the tape, records the register readings, and removes the tape.  For POS systems, the activity manager or designee runs the appropriate shift closeout or  summary  reports.    Cashiers  complete  AF  Form  1875,  (or  systems  generated  form providing individual cashier accountability), and turn-in or deposit receipts.  If impractical to turn-in  or  deposit  cash  receipts  (e.g.,  24-hour  lodging  operation),  receipts  may  be  stored overnight in an approved storage area and container. 3.10.  Use  of  Marked  Money.  AFI 31-101, outlines the specific procedures for using “marked money” when storing $100,000 or more.  For facilities storing less than $100,000, the following procedures apply: 3.10.1.  If more than $7,500 cash is stored in a container, safe or vault, or used at a cashier cage or register: AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 21 3.10.1.1.  Include  at  least  three  $20  bills  in  an  unmarked  packet.    This  also  applies  to foreign currency, where applicable. 3.10.1.2.  Record  the  denomination,  serial  number,  and  series  year  (including  letter suffix) of each bill. 3.10.1.3.  Store the information in a locked container separate from the funds. 3.10.2.  The manager ensures cashiers place marked money in cash drawers and safes in such a  way  as  to  avoid  suspicion  or  alert  unauthorized  persons  of  its  presence.    Never  staple marked money together, paperclip, or store separately from other funds. 3.10.3.  Cashiers may inadvertently use marked money during the normal course of business to  make  change.    If  used,  the  cashier  marks  different  currency  repeating  the  procedures above. 3.11.  Using  AF  Form  2555,  NAF  Cash  Collection  Record.  Activities  or  functions  without cash  registers  use  AF  Form  2555  to  record  sales  and  services.    Customers  sign  the  form  after each  transaction.    The  form  is  not  required  if  using  a  cash  register.    However,  managers  may elect its use for additional control.  Use in conjunction with a cash register does not require the customer's  signature.    EXCEPTION:    Some  concessionaire  operations  require  customer signatures to record and verify sales.  Attach the completed AF Form 2555 to the AF Form 1875 as  supporting  documentation.    In  concessionaire  operations  using  NAFI-owned  Point-of-Sale (POS) registers with kick-out tapes, AF Form 2555 is not required. 3.12.  Controls for Special Events.  When AF Form 2555 or a cash register is not practical for special  events  such  as  carnivals,  ball  games,  installation  open  house  days,  etc.,  use  AF  Form 2045,  Bingo  Perpetual  Inventory.  The  activity  manager,  RM,  FSS  commander  or  director instructs  the  individual  or  individuals  they  designate  as  responsible  for  controlling  sales  and merchandise to use AF Form 2045 (Requires original and two copies for both issue and return).  The  designated  individual  ensures  all  items  are  issued  and  turned  in  at  their  retail  price,  and enters the total retail price for each item on the AF Form 2045 on issue and turn-in. 3.12.1.  On  issue,  the  designated  individual  gives  the  original  to  the  person  receiving  the merchandise; retains a copy, and sends a copy to the NAF AO. 3.12.2.  On  turn-in,  the  designated  individual  gives  the  original  to  the  person  returning  the merchandise; retains a copy for the cashier, and sends the other copy to the NAF AO. 3.12.3.  The cashier computes the cash accountability; compares the retail value of the issues less  the  retail  values  of  the  returns,  and  attaches  copies  of  all  AF  Forms  2045  to  AF  Form 1875.    The  cashier  reports  all  overages  and  shortages  to  the  activity  manager  who  takes appropriate action according to Chapter 8. 3.13.  Employee  Conduct  During  and  After  a  Robbery.  The primary  consideration during a robbery  is  always  the  safeguarding  of  human  life.    Managers  provide  employees  training  on procedures to follow in the event of a robbery, including avoiding any actions potentially posing increase  danger  to  customers  or  employees.    The  RPP  Manager  will  conduct  an  anti-robbery exercise  in  all  facilities  storing  over  $100,000  at  least  annually.    All  funds  storage  facilities, regardless of amount, conduct anti-robbery training for their personnel as determined by the IDC  (See AFI 31-101.). Train employees to: 22 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 3.13.1.  Activate  the  robbery  alarm  system  and  surveillance  system  during  the  robbery  if  it can be accomplished safely for locations with an alarm and/or surveillance system. 3.13.2.  Follow the robber's special instructions or note. 3.13.3.  Give the robber the amount demanded and if possible, include marked money. 3.13.4.  Observe  the  robber's  physical  features,  voice,  accent,  mannerisms,  dress,  and  if applicable,  identify  the  type  of  weapon  displayed,  and  any  other  characteristics  useful  for identification purposes. 3.13.5.  Observe  the  direction  of  the  robber's  escape,  and  description,  license  plate  number and state of issue of the escape vehicle used. 3.13.6.  Telephone SF when it is safe, and inform them a robbery has been committed. 3.13.7.  Secure  the  scene  of  the  robbery  to  avoid  disturbing  any  fingerprints  left  by  the robber;  avoid  unnecessary  handling  of  any  evidence;  and  safeguard  evidence  for  SF personnel. 3.13.8.  Designate an individual, when safe, to wait outside the office for SF personnel. 3.13.9.  Determine and record the names and addresses of persons witnessing the robbery or escape. 3.13.10.  Avoid discussing details of the robbery with others before reporting observations to the SF personnel. 3.13.11.  Notify the activity manager, RM, and FSS commander or director and comply with additional instructions as locally determined. 3.14.  Fire Prevention.  Activity managers must support the Air Force Fire Emergency Services (FES) Program and comply with procedures outlined in AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services Program.  (T-0) 3.15.  General  Building  Security.  Activity  managers  must  perform  regular  inspections  of facilities under their control.  3.16.  Forms  and  Records.  The  NAF  AO  and  operating  activities  must  provide  adequate storage facilities to secure pre-numbered and controlled forms, automated inventories, accounts receivable  records  (where  authorized),  membership  applications,  and  all  Privacy  Act  protected information.    A  locked  room  with  limited  access  satisfies  this  requirement.    See  Chapter  4  for pre-numbered forms controls.  (T-0) AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 23 Chapter 4 CONTROLLING CASH & CASH EQUIVALENTS 4.1.  Definition  of  Cash.  Cash  refers  to  coin,  currency,  traveler's  checks,  and  all  other negotiable  instruments  such  as  blank  checks,  money  orders,  and  gift  certificates.    Properly endorsed checks (refer to paragraph  4.18) are not considered negotiable instruments.  Minimum physical  safeguards  and  other  cash  protection  requirements  are  specified  in  Chapter  3  and  AFI 31-101. 4.1.1.  Document  and  control  checks  at  all  times.    Store  blank  check  stock  (if  used  at  your location), coupons,  gift certificates, and any other items easily converted to cash in a locked room,  locked  container,  or  safe.    For  normal  minimum  physical  safeguards  and  other  cash protection requirements (see AFI 31-101). 4.1.2.  The USAF NAF Property and Liability program provides coverage for losses caused by  dishonest  acts  involving  NAF  assets  for  all  NAFIs.    See  AFI  34-208,  Nonappropriated Fund Property and Liability Program, for coverage limits for money, securities, inventories, furniture, fixtures, and equipment. 4.2.  Controlling  Cash.  Managers  ensure  cashiers  have  no  accounting  duties  other  than preparing  reports  and  data  associated  with  cash  handling  functions.    Cashiers  may  not  have access  to  accounts  receivable  records  or  other  data  used  to  update  the  general  ledger  or subsidiaries.  The activity manager submits a formal request to the RM for approval to operate under  varying  conditions  on  a  case-by-case  basis  when  compliance  is  not  cost  effective, operationally  practical,  or  physically  possible.    If  approved,  the  RM  instructs  the  activity manager  to  review  the  cash  handling  requirement  once  a  year.    All  requesting  and  review documentation  is  maintained  in  the  LOF  file.  EXCEPTION:    Activities  using  a  POS  system enabled to update accounts receivable may permit cashiers access to these records. 4.3.  Bank Deposits.  The FSS commander or director and RM ensure operating managers avoid accumulating  cash  in  excess  of  operating  needs.    Activity  managers  keep  cash  on  hand  to  a minimum by making daily deposits to the central cashier or financial institution. 4.4.  Central  Cashier  Depository.  Each  installation  establishes  a  central  cashier  operation,  to include  a  night  depository  as  required  designed  to  provide  a  one-stop  service  for  installation activities  to  make  deposits,  turn  in  deposit  forms,  and  obtain  change  funds,  unless  local circumstances justify a waiver of this requirement. Submit waiver requests to AFSVA/FM   (T-0). 4.5.  Central  Cashier  Responsibilities.  The  RM  designates  central  cashier  responsibilities, including  receipting  for  funds  and  AF  Form  1878,  Central  Cashier  Deposit  Receipt,  from  all NAF revenue producing activities.  The central cashier consolidates all activity receipts into one deposit for all NAFIs, and makes one daily cash and/or check deposit to the financial institution.  Installations  using  the  electronic  over  the  counter  check  processing  function  will  continue  to process  checks  daily  through  the  Treasury  Department  for  electronic  check  deposits.    (T-0)  Daily, the central cashier will: 4.5.1.  Counts  all  cash  and  negotiable  instruments  physically  present  in  the  central  cashier depository using AF Form 2556, NAF Surprise of General Cashier's Cash Count. 24 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 4.5.2.  Records  receipts  turned  in  by  activities,  change  funds  issued  or  turned  in,  and  the amount  of  transfers  to  NAFIs  to  AF  Form  1877,  NAF  Central  Cashier  Control  Log.    The approved  AF  Form  1877  is  electronically  transmitted  to  the  Shared  Service  Center  (SSC) Cash  Reconciliation  Branch  for  processing  and  posting  to  the  general  ledger.    NOTE:  Internal control requires the presence of two individuals in the central cashier depository to open locked activity deposit bags containing receipts left in a designated night depository or with another activity overnight for turn in to the central cashier. 4.5.3.  Consolidates  all  funds  received,  and  prepares  a  bank  deposit  slip  in  triplicate  for  all checks and excess cash.  Retains one copy of the deposit slip and sends the original and one copy  to  the  servicing  financial  institution  with  the  deposit.    An  authorized  individual  may hand-carry daily deposits or they may be picked up by an armored car service, if warranted.  If funds are hand-carried, advise the security forces control center prior to leaving the secure area and follow the guidance of AFI 31-101. 4.5.4.  Reconciles  AF  Form  1877,  establishing  accountability  for  the  central  cashier  funds and submits to the RM or designee for approval. 4.6.  Functions  of  the  Central  Cashier.  Each  installation  establishes  a  central  cashier  unless local  circumstances  justify  a  waiver  of  this  requirement.    AFSVA/FM  approves  waivers.    The RM ensures the central cashier operation provides banking services for installation activities and NAFIs to make deposits, obtain change funds, and a separate location to turn in daily paperwork  (T-3). 4.6.1.  Use the central cashier operation to: 4.6.1.1.  Centralize control to increase efficiency. 4.6.1.2.  Save valuable time. 4.6.1.3.  Decrease the amount of banking transactions. 4.6.1.4.  Increase internal control by ensuring receipts from all activities are deposited in a timely manner. 4.6.1.5.  Consolidate  receipts  into  one  deposit  for  each  NAFI  for  deposit  at  the  banking facility.  4.6.1.6.  Supply foreign currency for activities authorized accommodation sales. 4.6.2.  The central cashier is not a check cashing facility for individuals. 4.6.3.  The RM notifies AFSVA/FM prior to implementing a central cashier operation. 4.6.4.  The  RM  prepares  operating  instructions  to  establish  internal  control  procedures ensuring  required  separation  of  duties  and  responsibilities  according  to  generally  accepted accounting principles. 4.6.5.  With  the  cooperation  of  the  IDC  and  security  forces,  develops  anti-robbery  training procedures. 4.6.6.  The RM, with the activity managers, establishes a schedule of activity central cashier deposits.  The schedule should consider the work load of the activity and NAF AO, and the hours of operation of the local financial institution. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 25 4.6.7.  Ensures central cashier hours correspond to the normal work hours for the installation, and are responsive to the needs of the activities. 4.6.8.  Gives consideration to re-circulating cash when establishing a schedule. For example, FSS cash producing activities should turn  in their receipts first; clubs, as cash users, should turn in their receipts last. 4.6.9.  The RM, or designee, conducts quarterly surprise cash counts and periodic reviews of the central cashier operations. 4.6.10.  The RM, or designee, ensures the level of funds the central cashier maintains meets the  needs  of  the  activities  and  at  the  same  time  retains  a  minimum  balance  in  the  central cashier fund. 4.6.11.  The  RM  or  designee  approves  purchases  of  cash  from  outside  sources  to  replenish the central cashier. 4.6.12.  NAF Accounting Office (personnel other than the central cashier) verifies the deposit and change fund amount daily and attaches the bank validated copy of the deposit slip to the original AF Form 1877.  Performs various reconciliation and validation functions associated with revenue processing. 4.7.  Activity  or  General  Change  Fund  Cashier  Responsibilities.  The  activity  or  general change fund cashier balances daily receipts on AF Form 1875 or POS generated cashier reports. 4.7.1.  Prepare AF Form1876, NAF Consolidated Cost Center Report.  The activity manager or designee approves and submits completed AF Form 1876 electronically to the SSC along with  documentation  required  to  support  the  deposit.    Print  two  copies  keeping  original signature with original supporting documents and turn into the NAF AO.  Retain a copy in the activity. 4.7.2.  If any application/system has a validated CAC enabled electronic signature taking the place of a wet signature, it may be deemed a system of record.  The system is then used to store the electronic and paper copies until no longer required. 4.7.3.  Prepare  AF  Form  1878,  Central  Cashier  Deposit  Receipt.    Turn  in  all  cash  receipts and  AF  Form  1878  to  the  central  cashier  or  designated  night  depository  according  to  the established schedule. 4.7.3.1.  The central cashier returns the original AF Form 1878 and a second copy to the activity, and retains a third copy to use in preparing the daily consolidated deposit.  The activity manager or designee forwards the original AF Form 1878 to the NAF AO with AF Form 1876. 4.7.3.2.  The  activity  or  general  change  fund  cashier  also  maintains  and  balances  the activity  change  funds.    The  activity  cashier  may  request  change  fund  replenishment  or increase  from  the  central  cashier  to  meet  activity  check  cashing  requirements.    This  is done  by  exchanging  customer's  checks  for  cash  at  the  central  cashier  depository.    This exchange  of  funds  requires  no  accounting  entry;  the  cashier  completes  AF  Form  1878 indicating the total amount of checks turned in less the cash received. 4.7.3.3.  Temporary increases to  activity change  funds for paydays, weekends, holidays, and  special  events  are  approved  by  the  RM.    Temporary  increases  must  be  within 26 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 approved fund storage limitations as stated in the  LOF.  The activity manager gives the central  cashier  a  minimum  of  two  business  days  advance  notice  for  the  temporary  fund increase to ensure availability of funds.  (T-3) 4.7.3.3.1.  The  activity  completes  an  AF  Form  2539,  NAF  Disbursement  Request, receives  RM  approval  prior  to  obtaining  the  funds  from  the  central  cashier.    This transaction  does  not  require  a  check  or  processing  through  accounts  payable.    The NAF AO prepares and processes an AF Form 1876 to record the change fund increase entered  on  AF  Form  1877  with  supporting  documentation.    The  activity  manager signs  for  the  temporary  increase  using  AF  Form  2557,  NAF  Cash  Receipt  Voucher.  Attach the AF Form 2557 with the original receipt and file in the LOF file in the NAF AO. 4.7.3.3.2.  The activity cashier includes turn-in of any temporary increases to change funds in  the normal  deposit  of cash receipts on AF Form 1876 on the first  workday after  completion  of  the  special  event.    Point-of-Sale  systems  which  process  the individual cashier reports and consolidated cashier reports will need to be printed out and  filed.    If  the  system  cannot  properly  retain/store  the  report,  then  reproduce  the form in a readable format as needed for accounting and audit work. 4.8.  Night Depositories.  Use night depositories when your cash supply at closing time exceeds the overnight fund storage limits. 4.8.1.  The FSS commander, director, or RM requests installation banking facilities install a night  depository  when  required.    Do  not  use  NAFs  to  establish  a  depository  within  the installation banking facility. 4.8.2.  The RM may prescribe a consolidated change fund storage depository to supplement the bank’s night depository.  The RM may require some activities to deposit receipts in the night  depository  while  placing  change  funds  in  a  consolidated  depository  (for  example,  a club or bowling center) when the activity does not have adequate security available. 4.8.3.  The  RMs  on  installations  without  night  depositories  must  provide  activities  with  a suitable  safe  and  all  other  required  security  measures  for  storing  cash  during  non-banking hours.  4.9.  Cashiers' Deposits.  Most activities deposit all cash receipts daily, including checks cashed from  the  check-cashing  change  fund.    With  approval  of  the  RM,  small  activities  which  take  in minimal amounts of cash (i.e., fitness centers and libraries) may make deposits weekly, monthly, or when receipts exceed $200.  Individual cashiers maintain daily cash and receipt accountability using AF Form 1875.  Report credit card charges daily using AF Form 1876. 4.9.1.  The RM designates, in writing, activities authorized to operate under this policy.  The RM  establishes  a  regular  deposit  schedule  for  these  activities,  reviews  their  fund  storage authorizations,  and  verifies  overnight  storage  authorization  for  an  amount  equal  to  the amount  of  their  change  funds  plus  $200.    These  activities  must  deposit  all  receipts  by  the close  of  business  on  the last  day  of  each  month.   The  central  cashier  monitors  the  deposits and reports missing deposits to the RM (T-3). 4.9.2.  If the FSS commander or director or site commander, upon the recommendation of the RM, determines the distance to the depository, or other circumstances preclude making daily AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 27 deposits, they may permit activities to hold receipts until the last banking day of the month if fund  storage  limits  are  not  exceeded.    Do  not  carry  receipts  from  one  accounting  period  to another. 4.9.3.  The activity cashier prepares a bank deposit slip in an original and two copies when a central  cashier  operation  does  not  exist  and  for  night  deposits  to  the  installation  banking facility.    The  cashier  submits  the  original  and  one  copy  to  the  bank  for  validation  and attaches one copy to the AF Form 1876 submitted to the NAF AO. 4.9.3.1.  The NAF AO receives the validated deposit slip from the bank and compares it to the suspense copy of the deposit slip for accuracy.  The NAF AO advises the RM and activity manager if differences exist, or if there is an unreasonable delay in receiving the validated  copy.    The  RM  and  activity  manager  immediately  resolve  any  problems identified. 4.9.3.2.  If  the  distance  to  the  depository  is  too  great  to  permit  making  cash  deposits  in person, they may be mailed using postal money orders.  Do not deduct the cost of money orders from receipts to be deposited.  Use petty cash funds to purchase money orders. 4.9.3.3.  Overseas  remote  locations  may  exchange  daily  cash  receipts  or  excess  cash  at the  local  Financial  Services  Office  (FSO),  when  permitted,  for  a  United  States  (U.S.) Treasury check. 4.9.3.4.  The NAF AO maintains a list of all checks or postal money orders mailed to off station  depositories  until  deposit  validations  are  received.    Make  the  list  in  sufficient detail to aid in recovering of funds in the event checks are lost, stolen, or destroyed. 4.9.4.  Overseas  areas  should  exchange  cash  for  U.S.  Treasury  checks  when  transmitting funds  to  the  U.S.    Use  the  same  procedures  for  deposits  mailed  to  an  overseas  military banking  facility  or  financial  institution  designated  as  an  authorized  depository  by  the  US Treasury.  The US Treasury Department authorizes all overseas military banking facilities to charge a fee for all uncollectible checks deposited.  The RM and NAF AO ensure this charge is passed on to the maker or endorser of the check when collection is made. 4.10.  Surprise  Cash  Counts.  All  FSS  activities  and  functions  are  subject  to  surprise  cash counts. 4.10.1.  The activity manager, or designated representative, who has no involvement with the cash function, makes a surprise cash count of all change funds, imprest funds, and receipts on hand in the activity at least quarterly.  In small activities where the activity manager usually performs  cashier  duties,  the  flight  chief  appoints  an  individual  to  conduct  the  surprise  cash count.  The cash count of the funds controlled by a general change fund cashier includes all "banks"  which  have  not  been  issued  to  other  cashiers.    The  individual  performing  the  cash count  determines  whether  to  count  banks  already  issued  (in  operation).    While  it  is  not necessary to count these banks each time when performing a surprise cash count, they must be counted at  least  annually.  When these banks  are not  counted, the individual conducting the cash count verifies the general change fund contains a receipt for each bank issued from the fund (T-0). 4.10.2.  The RM, or designee, performs a quarterly surprise cash count of the central cashier at least quarterly. 28 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 4.10.3.  At  least  once  during  the  fiscal  year,  the  NAFFA  or  designated  representative, conducts  a  surprise  cash  count  of  all  change  and  imprest  funds  at  each  activity  within  a NAFI. 4.10.4.  When  it  is  not  practical  or  economical  to  travel  to  satellite  or  off-base  activities  to conduct  surprise  cash  counts,  the  NAFFA  requests  the  Financial  Manager  (FM)  or  site commander (as appropriate) appoint an independent individual on site to conduct the surprise cash  count  at  least  once  during  the  fiscal  year  at  each  off-base  activity.    File  the  AF  Form 2556, or locally devised form documenting the annual cash count in the activity, and forward a copy to the NAFFA requesting the count. 4.11.  Performing Surprise Cash Counts.  All activities use AF Form 2556 (or similar locally devised  form)  for  surprise  cash  counts.    The  individual  performing  the  surprise  cash  count reviews  the  source  document  and  verifies  the  amount  of  the  change  or  imprest  fund  being counted, and the name of the person who signed for the funds.  Change funds are subject to fund storage  limitations.    Report  any  funds  identified  exceeding  established  limits  to  the  activity manager or RM.  The individual conducting the cash count: 4.11.1.  Counts  like  items  or  denominations  of  currency  and  coins  together  and  enters individually on AF Form 2556, or similar form.  When counting funds for a general cashier, consider the change funds transferred out to cashiers and deposits transferred in from a shift's receipts. 4.11.2.  Reviews  expenditures  and  advances  from  petty  cash  to  ensure  they  were  approved and  are  supported  by  AF  Form  2557  or  AF  Form  1401,  NAF  Petty  Cash/Refund  Voucher.  Ensure, when added to the cash on hand, the balance equals the amount of funds signed for and recorded in general ledger account code (GLAC) 105XXXX. 4.11.3.  Determines  accountability  of  cashiers'  banks  including  payments  for  dues,  fees, charges,  and  accounts  receivable,  by  reconciling  beginning  cash,  receipts,  and  accountable forms including ringing out the cash register.  Consider any difference between cash on hand and the computed cash accountability a cash overage or shortage..  4.11.4.  Counts the cash in the presence of the individual who signed for the funds.  Ensure the individual does not leave the area while the count is in progress.  In a large activity with more  than  one  cash  handling  area,  count  funds  simultaneously.    This  may  require  a  cash count team augmented with additional personnel.  Counts a variety of funds located adjacent to one another one at a time, or, if enough personnel are available, simultaneously, to prevent transfer of moneys between locations to cover a shortage. 4.11.5.  Carefully  examines  the  cash  counting  area  and  containers  and  ensures  all  cash  is counted.  Immediately reports any IOUs, post-dated checks, personal or payroll checks from the cashier, or the withholding of deposits by cashiers, to the activity manager and RM. 4.11.6.  Discusses the results of the cash count and observations made during the count with individuals involved, (e.g., cashiers, activity manager, and RM).  When the activity manager or representative, designated in writing, performs the cash count, retain AF Form 2556 in the activity, and provide FM a copy for the NAFFA's review.  AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 29 4.12.  Cash Refunds.  The RM may authorize activity managers to approve cash refunds not to exceed $500.  The RM ensures adequate supporting documentation and internal controls exist to substantiate  cash  refunds.  Record  refunds  on  AF  Form  1401  or  use  refund  vouchers programmatically produced by the automated lodging billing or Point of Sale System.  Activity managers  do  not  approve  refunds  for  special  order  merchandise  that  cannot  readily  be  sold  to another customer or returned to the vendor.  Activity managers only approve refunds including complete customer identification, (name, address, and telephone number) and signature.  Indicate the  amount,  item  or  service,  and  reason  for  the  refund  on  the  refund  authorization.    When authorized  by  the  RM,  refunds  may  be  paid  from  the  day's  receipts  or  from  a  petty  cash  fund.  Consider  refunds  paid  from  receipts  when  preparing  the  AF  Form  1876.  Attach  the  original refund voucher with the original sales slip (when available) to the AF Form 1875. 4.12.1.  Do  not  process  a  credit  transaction  except  as  a  correction  or  valid  refund  for  a previously processed credit card charge transaction; credit a customer's account for refunded charge sales.  This refund must be using the same credit card as the original purchase.  Never give a cash refund for a sale made on a credit card.  (T-0) 4.12.2.  Credit card refunds or adjustments shall not exceed the original transaction amount.  The  RM  ensures  adequate  supporting  documentation  and  internal  controls  exist  to substantiate refunds. 4.12.3.  Refunds  or  adjustments  shall  not  be  combined  for  multiple  receipts.    Individual refunds or adjustments shall be processed for each individual original receipt. 4.12.4.  Credit  card  refunds  shall  not  be  processed  more  than  90  days  after  the  original transaction date.  If a transaction was conducted with a credit card no longer valid, (expired, account closed), or a prepaid card that has been discarded (Visa or MasterCard gift card) and the cardholder is returning items, an exchange of merchandise, in-store credit, or re-issue of a gift  card  may  be  authorized  by  the  activity  manager  or  supervisor.    A  cash  refund  is unauthorized in these situations. 4.13.  Controlling  Checks  and  Other  Negotiable  Instruments.  Since  checks  are  highly susceptible to being converted to cash, document and control their receipt, issue, and return at all times.  Store blank check stock, coupons, money orders, gift certificates, and related items used as cash or as a cash substitute in a locked container, locked room, or safe.  Gift Cards are not a cash equivalent until they are activated.  It is encouraged to display inactivated gift cards so our customer can see and purchase easily. 4.14.  Cashing  Checks.  The  activity  manager  ensures  information  is  readily  available  to customers  on  the  Privacy  Act  provisions  according  to  AFI  33-332,  The  Air  Force  Privacy Program, and the activity’s check cashing policy.  The activity manager or designee should post a  sign  at  the  cashiers'  area  stating  the  check  cashing  policies  and  penalties  incurred  on  all returned checks.  The sign: 4.14.1.  Lists authorized types of negotiable instruments accepted for cashing and the limits for each. 4.14.2.  Requires customers to show an identification (ID) card to cash a check. 4.14.3.  Specifies the amount of the returned check service charge. 4.14.4.  Prohibits the requirement to provide Social Security Numbers (SSNs). 30 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 4.14.5.  Specifies the endorser is responsible to the FSS if the check is returned. 4.14.6.  States checks initially declined will be re-presented electronically. 4.14.7.  Activities cash checks for authorized members or customers only.  Cashiers cash two party  checks  only  with  the  approval  of  the  activity  manager  or  designee.    When  accepting two  party  checks,  cashiers  verify  the  first  party  placed  their  endorsement  in  the  proper location on the back of the check. 4.14.8.  Cashiers initial checks verifying the check bears the member's name, grade, last eight digits of the club membership card number (for club members), organization or assignment (branch  of  service  for  retirees),  and  mailing  address.    This  information  facilitates  timely follow-up and collection actions on returned checks. 4.14.9.  In  most  cases,  the  activity  will  have  the  SSN  for  patrons  in  another  database,  e.g., Club  Works.    Do  not  create  a  list  of  SSNs  outside  of  an  approved  non-Services  database.  Collection and storage of SSNs is prohibited. 4.14.10.  Activities do not cash their employees' NAF payroll checks unless the employee has a  membership  in  the  employing  activity.    Justification  for  approval  of  local  waivers  to  this requirement must consider the following conditions: 4.14.10.1.  Isolation of the activity. 4.14.10.2.  Distance  and  availability  of  a  banking  facility  for  employees  to  cash  their checks. 4.14.10.3.  Volume  of  the  check  cashing  activity  and  its  impact  on  the  activity's capability to serve its patrons. 4.14.10.4.  Cash on hand limits. 4.14.10.5.  Impact on cash flow. 4.14.10.6.  Local environmental conditions and related risk. 4.14.10.7.  Need for a comprehensive OI to prevent compromise of internal controls. 4.14.10.8.  The potential for collusion or compromise of internal controls, or both. 4.14.11.  Cashiers do not cash their own checks (personal or payroll) from a change fund or cash receipts for which they are currently responsible.  This includes initiating a credit card transaction to refund their credit card. 4.14.12.  The  FSS  commander  or  director  may  authorize  individual  activities  to  accept checks  for  up  to  $20  over  the  amount  of  a  completed  transaction.    Do  not  grant  blanket approval  for  all  activities  to  cash  checks  over  the  amount  of  purchase.    The  NAF  AO maintains  the  approval  in  the  LOF  file.    Activity  managers  submit  requests  with  adequate justification  to  the  FSS  commander  or  director.    As  a  minimum,  justification  for  approval must consider the following factors:  (T-3) 4.14.12.1.  Isolation of the activity. 4.14.12.2.  Local environmental conditions and related risk. 4.14.12.3.  Funds storage limitation. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 31 4.14.12.4.  Volume  of  the  check  cashing  activity  and  its  impact  on  the  activity's capability to serve its patrons. 4.14.12.5.  A  review  of  the  activity's  returned  check  history  and  the  adverse  effect  of  a possible increase in returned checks from patrons. 4.14.13.  The FSS commander or director, with  the installation commander's approval,  may increase installation check cashing controls and follow-up actions when conditions warrant. 4.15.  NAF Service Charge for Returned Checks.  The service charge for all returned checks is $25.00, payable to and automatically pulled to the SSC.  The NAF service charge is in addition to any bank charge on returned checks.  4.16.  Checks  and  Cash  Received  By  Mail.  All  activity  and  functional  managers  ensure  no employee  has  immediate  access  to  cash  funds  while  opening  incoming  mail  and  removing checks and cash.  The activity manager designates an employee within the activity other than the general  cashier  or  accounts  receivable  clerk  to  open  the  incoming  mail  and  remove  all  checks and cash (T-0). 4.16.1.  The  designated  employee  lists  checks  daily,  indicating  the  number  and  date  of  the check,  the  account  number  and  credit  amount,  and  name  of  the  maker.    Checks  processed through the electronic check deposit function are not endorsed.  Checks included in the daily cash  receipts,  deposited  to  a  local  financial  institution,  and  must  be  endorsed  using  the endorsement stamp supplied by AFSVA Budget Branch (FMB).  Once all checks are entered, the designated employee totals and signs the list and gives the checks and list to the general cashier. 4.16.2.  The  general  cashier  verifies  and  initials  the  total  on  the  list  certifying  it  is  correct, deposits the checks, and prepares a single receipt for the total amount and attaches the list of checks as backup. 4.16.3.  The  activity  manager  includes  cash  payments  received  by  mail  in  the  activity  cash handling  instructions,  including  making  random  reviews  by  initialing  the  list  on  a  monthly basis to ensure all checks received become part of each day's receipts and are included in the general cashier's report. 4.17.  Endorsing  Checks.  Checks  processed  through  the  electronic  check  deposit  function  are not  endorsed.      Checks  included  in  the  daily  cash  receipts,  deposited  to  a  local  financial institution,  and  must  be  endorsed  using  the  endorsement  stamp  supplied  by  AFSVA/FMNTB.  The endorsement stamp is printed as follows:  (T-0) 4.17.1.  Line 1:  For Deposit Only 4.17.2.  Line 2:  Name of Bank or Credit Union (only if required by the local bank) 4.17.3.  Line 3:  Local Bank Account Number 4.17.4.  Line 4:  Dept of AF, Air Force Financial Management Fund (AFFMF) 4.17.5.  (“Return check to bank name/account number” is included in the bank stamp) 4.18.  Returned  Checks.  All  returned  checks  are  consolidated  and  processed  by  the  U.S. Treasury or the concentration bank.  Checks returned by the check writer’s financial institution are  re-presented  electronically  for  collection  on  the  1st  and  15th of  the  month  if  returned  upon 32 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 initial  presentation.    The  SSC  is  responsible  for  the  redemption  of  all  returned  checks,  proper accountability for the checks, and follow-up collection actions.  In the event a returned check is returned to the NAF AO, forward to the SSC for debt collection. 4.18.1.  The  SSC  notifies  the  NAF  AO  of  the  write-off  amount  when  a  check  fails  re-presentment is deemed uncollectible.  The SSC approves write off amounts up to $2,500 for uncollectible returned checks.  Write off of returned checks over $2,500 must receive NAF Council approval.  After the NAF AO notifies the SSC the NAFs Council’s approval of the write-off,  the  SSC  processes  all  eligible  debts  for  collection  via  the  TOP.    All  payments received from the TOP are sent directly back to the installation where the debt originated via Cash Management Investment Program (CMIP)  (T-0). 4.18.2.  A due process letter is forwarded by the SSC to the debtor, informing the debtor of the  AF  debt  including  applicable  bank  and  processing  fees.    Returned  check  expenses  are charged to the activity where the check was cashed. 4.19.  Redemption  of  Returned  Checks.  If  an  individual  approaches  a  Services  activity wishing  to  redeem  a  returned  check  based  on  a  notification  from  his/her  financial  institution, activity  employees  should  advise  the  individual  two  attempts  will  be  made  to  re-present  the check.  The NAF AO is the redemption point for debtors who have received SSC notification in writing of the debt and want to make a payment for returned checks at the installation.  The NAF AO  must  contact  the  SSC  Credit  &  Collections  Branch  to  determine  the  status  of  the  debtor’s account  before  accepting  payment.    Do  not  accept  a  check  to  cover  a  returned  check.    Accept only cash or money orders unless the individual provides documentation they were not at fault, such  as  a  letter  from  a  banking  facility  acknowledging  a  bank  error  caused  the  check  to  be returned (T-0). 4.19.1.  Installations  may  establish  an  for  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  and  accrue  for these  write-offs.    Installations  should  only  do  so  if  the  amounts  are  consistent  and  large enough  to  warrant  an  accrual.    Installations  will  maintain  these  accounts,  and  adjust  the allowance accounts when notified by SSC of a write-off.  Otherwise, treat these write-offs as a normal period expense in the applicable activity cost center. 4.19.2.  If payment is received at the installation, the NAF AO processes an adjustment form to  reverse  the  write-off.    Otherwise,  SSC  reverses  the  write-off  when  payment  is  received from the TOP and sent back to the installation via cash transfer. 4.20.  Suspension  of  Check  Cashing  Privileges.  Activities  must  obtain  the  weekly  check writers  report  (suspension  list)  for  cashier  validation  prior  to  accepting  customer  checks.    This list is provided and maintained by the SSC.  Persons who have issued returned checks, (except those  acknowledged  in  writing  as  bank  errors)  are  placed  on  a  check  suspension  list.    Credit Cards are not an acceptable form of payment for returned checks.  (T-0)  Mandatory suspension periods are: 4.20.1.  First returned check:  3 month suspension. 4.20.2.  Two checks within 6 months:  6 month suspension. 4.20.3.  More than two checks within 6 months:  1year suspension. 4.20.4.  Two or more 1 year suspensions:  permanent suspension. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 33 4.20.5.  Cashiers do not accept checks from individuals on the returned check or suspension list, and will not accept checks from individuals without proper identification. 4.20.6.  The  activity  manager  or  designee  posts  a  sign  at  the  cashiers'  area  stating  the activity's check cashing policies and the penalties incurred on all returned checks. 4.21.  Disbursements.  The  proper  office  prepares  and  the  RM  or  designee  approves  a disbursement  request  (DR)  and  submits  to  the  SSC  with  proper  documentation.    The  SSC Accounts  Payable  (AP)  Section  will  process  the  disbursement  request  and  send  the  check payment or EFT to the appropriate payee.  EFT is the preferred method of payment even when using the DR process. 4.21.1.  Overseas  locations  requiring  use  of  check  stock  should  refer  to  AFI  34-209  for documentation supporting payments, protection of check signing equipment, control of blank checks,  and  check  writing  requirements.    (AP  uses  bottom  line  to  print  checks).    NAF  AO use  of  facsimile  signatures  when  using  check  signing  equipment  is  authorized.    Data imprinted  into  the  check  MICR  band  (located  at  the  bottom  of  the  check)  impedes  check processing  procedures  and  causes  rejects.    Adjust  the  placement  or  replace  signature  plates imprint  within  the  check  MICR  band.    Refer  to  AFMAN  34-215,  Procedures  for  the  Cash Management and Investment Program, for additional signature requirements. 4.21.2.  The  RM  or  an  alternate  representative  signs  checks.    See  AFMAN  34-215  for signature card requirements. 4.21.3.  Do not make checks payable to cash. 4.22.  Services  (SV)  Coupon  Controls.  The  FSS  commander  or  director  approves  the  use  of, and  sets  the  value  for  all  SV  coupons.    Each  coupon  issued  must  have  an  expiration  date  and clearly  state  its  value  and  when,  where,  how,  and  who  may  use  the  coupons.    Activities  use coupons only as a promotional sales devise and not as a credit system.  To avoid abuse, control coupons  for  free  play,  not  redeemed  in  conjunction  with  a  sale,  (e.g.,  free  line  of  bowling,  or round  of  golf).    EXCEPTION:    These  guidelines  do  not  apply  to  coupons  in  national  or  local coupon redemption programs available to the general public  (T-0). 4.22.1.  Color code coupons issued on a recurring basis by series. 4.22.2.  The activity manager or designee maintains a list of the quantity of coupons printed and  issued,  and  advises  the  NAF  AO  of  the  quantity,  series,  type,  and  expiration  date  of coupons issued. 4.22.3.  Activities  do  not  redeem  coupons  for  cash,  or  accept  coupons  for  tips,  gratuities, payment of dues, or the purchase of concessionaire merchandise or services. 4.22.4.  Cashiers void or deface coupons upon receipt.  Cashiers account for coupons on the cashier's report, and attach them to the AF Form 1876 sent to the NAF AO. 4.23.  National  and  Local  Coupons.  With  the  approval  of  the  FSS  commander  or  director, activities  within  those  states  which  permit  coupon  use  in  the  private  sector  civilian  stores  may participate  in  national  or  local  coupon  redemption  programs.    The  FSS  commander  or  director approves on a case-by-case basis those activities who may participate (refer to AFI 34-201). 4.23.1.  The  RM  issues  an  OI  for  coupons  including  procedures  and  controls  for  the participating activities and the NAF AO.  The RM ensures the administrative and accounting 34 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 costs  associated  with  the  redemption  program  does  not  exceed  benefits  to  the  customers  or the activity. 4.23.2.  The  NAF  AO  submits  coupons  for  redemption  according  to  manufacturer's  and distributor's requirements. 4.23.3.  Activities  with  POS  systems  may  program  their  registers  to  account  for  coupons.  Activities without POS account for coupons on a separate key.  The total register sale reflects the  gross  sale  (before  coupon  reduction).    The  cashier  lists  national  or  local  coupons separately from SV coupons on the cashier's report, and attaches them to the AF Form 1876 sent to the NAF AO.  Refer to AFI 34-209 for detailed accounting instructions for coupons. 4.24.  Gift  Certificates.  Customers purchase gift certificates to redeem for goods and services.  Gift certificates are not coupons.  Distribute and redeem for purchase value, not to exceed face value.  The activity numbers gift certificates for control purposes (pre-numbering by the printer is recommended) and specifies an expiration date.  The activity manager or designee reports gift certificate  issues  and  redemptions  on  AF  Form  1875  and  maintains  a  list  of  gift  certificates printed, issued, and redeemed by number.  The list provides an audit trail for the other payables subsidiary  and  the  applicable  general  ledger  account.    To  prevent  any  possible  reuse,  cashiers deface gift certificates at the time of redemption by writing or stamping void across the front of the certificate.  At the end of the accounting period, the activity manager or designee forwards a list of expired gift certificates and their amounts to the NAF AO. 4.25.  FSS  Gift  Cards.  FSS gift cards are pre-numbered to control issuance by maintaining an accurate inventory of unused cards available for new activation (“sale”).  In activities using the VeriFone  Vx-570  swipe  terminal,  the  swipe  transaction  is  processed  independent  of  the  cash register/POS.  The potential exists to load funds on the card through the swipe without recording a transaction into the cash register.  Use of the swipe terminal must always be accompanied by an entry in the cash register/POS to avoid any shortages for the business day between the activity AF Form 1876 and Gift Card Report.  The FSS gift card may not be redeemed for cash and will not be replaced if lost or stolen  (T-0). 4.25.1.  Air  Force  Services  Strategic  Marketing  (AFSVA/SVK)  issues  gift  cards.    The process  for  ordering  cards  is  through  an  “annual  call”  to  the  installations  conducted  by AFSVA/SV.    Consider  redistribution  from  other  activities  before  requesting  additional  gift cards  from  AFSVA/SVK  if  additional  cards  are  required  prior  to  the  annual  call.    Contact AFSVA/SVK (Strategic Marketing Office) to request additional cards.  Upon receipt of new cards, the NAF AO logs all gift cards using the sequential numbers on the back of the card. 4.25.2.  The  NAF  AO  controls  the  unloaded  gift  cards,  but  not  yet  issued  to  an  activity.  Maintain the cards in a secure, locked storage container.  Use a locally devised form to log in and issue cards to activity managers or authorized designee. 4.25.3.  The NAF AO determines how many gift cards each activity receives; issues them in sequential order; and the activity manager or authorized designee signs for the gift cards. 4.25.4.  Cashiers sign for receipt of ‘unsold’ gift cards.  Cashiers record the gift card numbers on  the  Controlled  Documents  Log  (page  2  of  the  AF  Form  1875)  at  the  beginning  of  their shift.    At  the  end  of  their  shift,  cashiers  annotate  the  cards  activated  and  any  un-activated cards may remain on display.  The number of cards sold are recorded on the AF Form 1875 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 35 and verified at the end of shift.  The next cashier logs in the remaining un-activated cards on their AF Form 1875.  The AF Form 1876 will reflect the total activated cards for the day. 4.25.5.  Managers ensure all employees complete the sale transaction before activating a new card  and  loading/reloading  the  purchased  amount  on  the  gift  card.    Gift  cards  will  not  be issued to  patrons without  the amount being  “purchased” and loaded on the card.   This  also applies to amounts added to a previously purchased card. 4.25.6.  Activities  using  the  AF  Form  1875  to  record  cashier  accountability,  record  card redemptions on AF Form 1875 in Section V, Cashier Accountability, as a separate line item from commercial charges, coupons, etc. 4.25.7.  In addition to controlling the unsold/unused cards, managers must diligently monitor daily cash shortages generated through automated merchant processing to ensure cards have not been loaded without the corresponding sale amount rung in the cash register/point of sale (POS) (T-0). 4.25.8.  When  performing  the  activity  managers’  quarterly  surprise/unannounced  cash counts, ensure the gift cards issued to cashiers are accounted for  as either sold or on-hand. 4.25.9.  After recording activated and loaded with the initial purchased amount cards “sold”  on the FSS Gift Card Activity Control Log, the activity no longer is required to track the use of the cards.  Redemptions are tracked using merchant process reporting with the Air Force Central Funds. 4.25.10.  Cards presented by patrons for “re-loading” (purchasing an additional amount to be added to the card balance) are not tracked in the activity as a controlled form. 4.25.11.  Record  FSS  Gift  Cards  “sold,”  both  new  activations  and  card  re-loads,  as  well  as cards redeemed, on  AF  Form  1876.  Activities use AF  Form  1878 for credit card charges, issuances, and redemptions.  Each charge must be a separate line item. 4.26.  Promotional Gift Cards.  The FSS commander shall establish a written policy on the use of FSS gift cards for activity use, e.g., promotional events, to include establishing procedures for approving dollar limitations, either recurring or on a case-by-case basis. 4.26.1.  When  an  authorized  activity,  without  the  ability  to  process  gift  cards  (e.g.,  Fund Administration,  Marketing,  etc.),  issues  approved  promotional  gift  cards,  the  cards  must  be activated or swiped in another NAF resale activity  (T-0). 4.26.2.  FSS gift cards will not be used for employee on-the-spot awards, or other employee incentives.    NAFs  may  not  be  used  to  award  Appropriated  Funds  (APFs)  or  active  duty military employees, except where specifically allowed in AFI 34-201. 4.27.  Pre-numbered Forms.  The activity manager develops and the RM or designee approves OIs for controlling pre-numbered forms issued to the activity. 4.27.1.  The  NAF  AO  or  designated  personnel  (separate  from  the  user  operation)  pre-numbers and issues the following forms when used in lieu of cash register readings for cash accountability: 4.27.1.1.  AF Form 1182, NAF Child Care Center Register 4.27.1.2.  AF Form 1400, NAF Vending/Amusement Machine Collection Report 36 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 4.27.1.3.  AF  Form  2555,  NAF  Collection  Record,  (also  used  for  concessionaire operations) 4.27.1.4.  AF Form 2557, NAF Cash Receipt Voucher 4.27.2.  After  issue  by  the  NAF  AO  or  designated  personnel,  the  activity  manager  controls the above forms and accounts for them on the back of AF Form 1875.  The cashier attaches forms used to the corresponding AF Form 1875 filed in the activity. 4.27.3.  Activities  use  AF  Forms  1182  and  1376,  NAF  Supply  Loan  Receipt,  in  addition  to cash registers to  provide other types of accountability.  The activity manager controls  them according to the appropriate operational instruction. 4.27.4.  Theme  park  tickets,  advance  green  fee  cards,  rounds  played  cards,  and  similar instruments  are  also  controlled  forms.    The  RM  and  activity  manager  develop  local procedures for protecting unused stocks and maintaining accountability for sales.  The NAF AO issues pre-numbered advance green-fee cards to the activity manager, who controls and protects them at the activity. 4.27.5.  For  activities  unable  to  support  the  use  of  the  standard  AF  Catering  software (mandatory  for  club  operations)  to  account  for  unique  events  such  as  wedding  receptions, special events, and parties, forms may be locally devised and pre-numbered to record receipts or establish accountability.  AFSVA/FM approves locally devised forms. 4.27.5.1.  The  RM  approves  procedures  for  numbering  and  controlling  all  special  forms ensuring there is a connecting link between the document outlining the requirements for the event and the special form used to establish the receivable. 4.27.5.2.  The  activity  manager  purchases  and  controls  special  forms  and  pre-numbers them  prior  to  issue.  Recommend  the  forms  be  pre-numbered  at  the  printer.    Activity personnel  advise  the  activity  manager  and  RM  of  any  missing  documents  immediately upon  discovery.    The  activity  manager  provides  the  RM  with  written  disposition  on  all missing pre-numbered documents. 4.27.5.3.  Upon  completion  of  an  event,  if  a  payment  is  not  made,  forward  the  special form to the NAF AO to establish the appropriate receivable. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 37 Chapter 5 ESTABLISHING AND CONTROLLING CHANGE AND IMPREST FUNDS 5.1.  Establishing Change Funds.  The RM or site commander (at isolated or remote locations) authorizes the establishment and amount of all change funds subject to fund storage limitations established in AFI 31-101. See Chapter 3 of this AFI. 5.1.1.  Activities  use  change  funds  only  for  making  change,  cashing  checks,  and  with  RM approval,  for  making  petty  cash  purchases  and  other  imprest  fund  requirements  (refer  to paragraph  5.2). 5.1.2.  Excessive change funds present  a potential  for cash losses  from  theft and reduce the amount  of  cash  available  for  investment  and  other  purposes.    For  these  reasons,  activities keep change funds to a minimum. The RM reviews all change fund requirements and reduces change  funds  to  the  minimum  required  for  operations.    The  RM  determines  change  fund requirements based on actual requirements computed from 12 months of historical data, and revalidates each change fund annually. 5.1.3.  The  RM  writes  a  squadron  OI  establishing  procedures  for  the  use,  control,  and protection  of  all  change  and  imprest  funds  in  NAFI  activities.    Supplemental  OIs  may  be written for activities requiring specific cash handling procedures.  Activity managers ensure all cash handling employees perform their duties according to the procedures specified in the OIs. 5.1.3.1.  All  change  and  imprest  cashiers/custodians,  as  well  as  all  oversight  and supervisory individuals, must complete the mandatory initial and annual internal control training module through the FSS training manager.  (See Chapter 2)  (T-0). 5.1.4.  Special  Change  Fund.    The  RM  may  authorize  a  special  change  fund  for  weekends, paydays, and special events.  These special change funds are usually issued to the activity the day before the weekend, payday, or event.  The activity must deposit the special change fund the first business day following the occasion. 5.1.5.  Slot  Machine  Change  Fund. AFSVA/SVP/FM according to AFI 34-148, Air Force Gaming Program.   Change  funds  are  authorized  and  issued  by 5.2.  Establishing  Imprest  Funds.  Activities  may  use  imprest  funds  for  a  designated  purpose with  special  controls  and limitations.  Subject  to  the limitations of this chapter, the RM or site commander approves the establishment and dollar amount of all imprest funds. Authorized types of imprest funds are: 5.2.1.  Petty cash fund (maintain funds for U.S. and foreign currency separately). 5.2.2.  Special activity prize fund, used for special activities such as bingo, colorama, etc., as approved by the RM or site commander and FSS commander or director, and, 5.2.3.  Vending and amusement machine imprest fund. 5.3.  Use  of  Change  Funds  and  Receipts  in  Lieu  of  Imprest  Funds.  At the discretion of the RM,  activities  and  NAFIs  not  having  an  imprest  fund  (e.g.,  petty  cash  or  special  activity  prize fund) may use change funds and receipts for petty cash-type purchases and special activity prize 38 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 fund requirements.  Blanket approval for all activities to make payments from change funds and receipts is unauthorized. 5.3.1.  The RM approves requests on a case-by-case basis considering factors such as the size and mission of the requesting activity, and the amount of the existing change fund.  Refer to paragraph 5.10. on establishing imprest funds. 5.3.2.  The  central  cashier  or  activity  cashier  reimburses  these  change  funds  from  daily receipts after receipt of completed AF Form 1401s, with receipts attached.  Change funds are not  reimbursed  for  advances  made  to  individuals.    Use  AF  Form  2557,  to  document  all advances made from the change fund. 5.3.3.  When the RM approves payment from change funds and receipts, the activity manager designates,  in  writing,  each  cashier  authorized  to  process  petty  cash-type  purchases  and special activity prize fund requirements.  The activity manager provides cashiers with a list of  activity  personnel  authorized  to  approve  transactions  reimbursed  by  change  funds  and receipts.  The activity manager files a copy of the written designations in the activity. 5.3.4.  The  RM,  in  conjunction  with  the  activity  manager,  prepares  an  OI  establishing  cash control procedures and internal controls to reimburse change funds from receipts. 5.3.4.1.  Provide detailed instructions for designated cashiers to follow. 5.3.4.2.  Include  the  requirement  stating  cashiers  accept  only  properly  completed  AF Forms 1401. 5.3.4.3.  Include  guidelines  for  purchasing  resale  items  using  change  funds,  providing receipts and updating the resale inventory. 5.3.5.  Activity  cashiers  include  on  their  AF  Form  1875,  purchases  made  from  the  change fund.    Cashiers  attach  completed  AF  Forms  1401,  with  receipts  attached  to  the  AF  Form 1875, as backup.  The activity manager or designee consolidates all AF Forms1875, on AF Form  1876,  for  submission  to  the  SSC.    Forward  hard  copy  AF  Form  1876,  including attached AF Forms 1401 and receipts to the NAF AO as the office of record. 5.3.6.  All other controls, procedures, and limitations for imprest and/or change funds in AFI 34-209,  remain  in  effect  and  apply  to  petty  cash-type  purchases  and  special  activity  prize fund requirements made from change funds and receipts. 5.4.  Change  Fund  Accountability.  The RM establishes and maintains cash accountability for change funds at all times, using AF Form 2557. 5.4.1.  The  activity  manager  signs  for  all  change  funds  using  AF  Form  2557.    File  the original receipt in the activity LOF file in the NAF AO. 5.4.2.  The  activity  manager,  in  turn,  obtains  a  signed  AF  Form  2557,  from  designated  or general change fund cashiers upon receipt of the funds. 5.4.3.  Designated  or  general  change  fund  cashiers,  in  turn,  get  receipts  from  other  cashiers issued funds. 5.4.4.  Cashiers  signs  for  cash  and  accountable  documents  using  AF  Form  1875.    Cashiers turn in their daily change fund and receipt at the close of business, obtaining a signed receipt (bottom of AF Form 1875) for total funds turned in. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 39 5.4.5.  Signed AF Forms 1875, remain in the issuing change fund until turn-in occurs. 5.4.6.  The  activity  manager  may  employ  a  general  change  fund  cashier  (head  cashier) responsible  for  all  activity  receipts  and  ensuring  all  personnel  handling  funds  follow established cash control procedures. This cashier counts the general change fund daily using AF Form 2556, and attaches the original to the AF Form 1876, submitted to the NAF AO. 5.4.7.  Store change funds overnight at the activity in an approved storage container or locked safe  (refer  to  AFI  31-101)  so  they  are  available  to  start  the  following  day's  activities.  Activities not equipped to store change funds overnight deposit them in a central depository, designated by the RM, which provides the required safeguards  (See Chapter 3.). 5.5.  Replenishment  of  Change  Funds.  Activities  replenish  change  funds  using  the  following options: 5.5.1.  Exchanging customer's checks for cash from  cash receipts;  bringing the change fund up to the authorized level. 5.5.2.  Exchanging  customer's  checks  for  cash  at  the  central  cashier  depository  (refer  to paragraph 4.7.3.). 5.5.3.  Exchanging  completed  AF  Forms  1401,  with  receipts  attached  for  cash  from  daily receipts. 5.6.  Change  Fund/Receipts  Turn-In.  Activities  use  the  following  procedures  whenever  a cashier turns in their change fund and receipts: 5.6.1.  The activity manager or designee produces end of shift  report  from  the POS  or cash register.  End of shift  report is  used to validate submission of daily receipts after receipt of funds from the individual cashiers. 5.6.2.  The cashier counts all cash (less reimbursements to the change fund for completed AF Form  1401s),  checks,  credit  card  charges,  coupons,  and  charge  slips  and  records  the information on AF Form 1875, or applicable POS report. 5.6.3.  The cashier also documents the accountability of all pre-numbered forms on page 2 of the AF Form 1875. 5.6.4.  The cashier transfers all cash and documentation to the activity manager or designee who  verifies  the  count,  computes  cash  accountability,  and  records  the  information  on  AF Form 1875. 5.6.5.  Both individuals sign AF Form 1875, and the cashier keeps the receipt portion. 5.6.6.  The  activity  manager  or  designee  attaches  supporting  documents  to  the  AF  Form 1875, and secures the funds. 5.6.7.  Cashiers  are  not  permitted  to  retain  overages  nor  are  they  permitted  or  required  to make up shortages. Shortages are treated as cash losses and resolved according to Chapter 8.  Record overages or shortages to the activity cost center where incurred.  Activity manager or designee establishes method to track individual cashier overages and shortages. 5.6.8.  The activity manager or designee closely monitors excessive no sale rings and refund vouchers as they represent potentials for cash manipulation. 40 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 5.7.  Petty  Cash  Imprest  Fund.  The  primary  function  of  this  imprest  fund  is  for  small purchases.    The  dollar  amount  of  this  fund  should  be  minimal.    Do  not  circumvent  NAF purchasing  policies  and  procedures.    The  RM  delegates  purchasing  authority  to  the  petty  cash fund  custodians  (refer  to  AFMAN  64-302,  Nonappropriated  Fund  (NAF)  Contracting Procedures). 5.7.1.  The activity manager or designee ensures individuals advanced petty cash funds return invoices  for  items  purchased,  and  all  unused  cash  within  two  working  days.    Include  this procedure in OIs.  EXCEPTION: Individuals advanced petty cash funds in conjunction with out-of-town conferences, workshops,  etc., must return invoices and unused cash within two workdays of returning to the home installation.  (T-3) 5.7.2.  The  RM  sets  petty  cash  fund  levels  of  not  more  than  $3,000  per  activity.    Maintain authorized  limits  in  the  LOF  file  in  the  NAF  AO  and  a  copy  in  the  activity.    The  RM, working  with  the  activity  manager,  sets  the  required  petty  cash  fund  level.    Levels  should vary between activities.  Consider the following factors in establishing petty cash fund levels: 5.7.2.1.  The solvency of the fund. 5.7.2.2.  Established fund storage limitations (refer to AFI 31-101). 5.7.2.3.  Type of storage container and facility available to the activity. 5.7.2.4.  Volume  of  transactions;  average  number  and  dollar  value  of  monthly disbursements based on historical review. 5.7.2.5.  The activity's mission. 5.7.2.6.  Impact on cash flow. 5.7.2.7.  Isolation of the activity. 5.7.3.  NAFIs  do  not  use  petty  cash  funds  to  pay  employees  except  as  written  below, entertainers, or individual services contractors.  EXCEPTION:  NAFIs located at remote or isolated  sites  may  pay  for  entertainment  or  individual  services  using  petty  cash.    Payments for entertainment and individual services requires a contract (refer to AFMAN 64-302).  On occasion,  offline  employee  pay  may  also  be  paid  from  either  general  change  or  petty  cash fund when conditions  warrant  such payment, upon approval  of RM or designee.  However, this practice must be minimized as much as possible. 5.7.4.  If  authorized  by  the  RM,  petty  cash  custodians  can  make  refunds  from  petty  cash funds.  The activity manager or designee approves all refunds. 5.7.5.  Payment for any single purchase, repair, or refund, as authorized above, from a US or foreign  currency  petty  cash  imprest  fund  may  not  exceed  $500.    Do  not  split  expenditures from petty cash funds to circumvent the limitations. 5.8.  Government  Purchase  Card  (PCard)  for  NAF  Purchases.  The  PCard  is  the  preferred method  of  payment  for  NAF  purchases.    Using  the  PCard  streamlines  purchasing  and  reduces high  administrative  costs  associated  with  the  processing  of  purchase  orders  and  vendor payments.  This is the only authorized credit card for NAF purchases.  To implement the Use of the  NAF  Government  Purchase  Card  for  NAF  small  purchases  within  FSS  NAF  activities,  the RM  follows  AFI  34-275.    In  the  case  of  credit  card  abuse,  the  RM  takes  appropriate  action according to Chapter 9. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 41 5.9.  Special  Activity  Prize  Imprest  Fund.  NAFIs  use  the  special  activity  prize  imprest  fund for the purpose of awarding cash prizes for business activity special events such as bingo. 5.9.1.  The  RM  ensures  the  established  level  of  cash  for  the  prize  fund  will  not  exceed  the total cash for the total sessions of play. 5.9.2.  Activities  are  authorized  to  make  payment  of  cash  prizes  from  the  cash  receipts  or change fund. 5.9.3.  The activity pays  all individual prizes by cash.  The activity issues  IRS Form W-2G from the Services Information System (SIS)(formally called SAIS) for cash prizes of $1,200 or more for one game, at the time of the win. 5.9.3.1.  Unless  the  customer  requests  taxes  be  withheld,  taxes  are  not  required  to  be withheld on bingo winnings  (T-0). 5.9.4.  If the winner elects  to  receive a check or  EFT, the activity prepares and submits AF Form  2539  with  a  copy  of  AF  Form  2046,  NAFI  Bingo  Activity  Report,  (or  similar  locally developed  form  for  other  special  activities)  to  the  SSC  through  the  NAF  AO  the  first business day after the day of the win. 5.9.5.  Forward a copy of the W-2G to the NAF AO the next business day with the activity reimbursement request.  The activity manager ensures either replenishment or deposit of the special  activity  prize  fund  on  the  first  workday  after  completion  of  a  session  of  play.    The activity manager specifies in an OI if the funds are replenished or deposited.  NOTE:  If there is only one or two special activity sessions per month, it may be advantageous to deposit the funds to reduce the amount of idle cash on hand. 5.9.6.  AFSVA/FM  centrally  reports  the  data  electronically  to  the  IRS  at  the  end  of  the calendar  year.    Although  the  information  will  be  centrally  reported,  installations  are responsible for depositing and reporting withholding taxes and completing IRS Form 945 by 31 January each calendar year.  A 1099-M is not issued for bingo winnings  (T-0). 5.10.  Vending  and  Amusement  Machine  Imprest  Fund.  Activities  use  this  fund  for  the reimbursement of vending and amusement machine malfunctions and maintenance testing. 5.10.1.  A  designated  cashier  may  advance  the  fund  to  other  individuals  such  as  the  game room attendant, or maintenance worker, etc., to conduct maintenance operations or customer refunds using AF Form 1401. 5.10.2.  The  RM  and  activity  manager  ensures  the  size  of  the  imprest  fund  is  sufficient  for conducting a month's business without replenishment. 5.11.  Replenishment  of  Imprest  Funds.  Activities  replenish  imprest  funds  as  many  times  as necessary,  but  always  as  of  the  last  workday  of  the  month.    The  activity  manager  or  designee approves AF Form 1401 supporting requests for replenishment. 42 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 6 CONTROL GAMING, AMUSEMENT, MUSIC, AND VENDING MACHINES 6.1.  Gaming Operations Controls and Procedures.  The Air Force Gaming Program is an Air Force centrally managed and operated program.  All activities with slot machine operations must implement  and  strictly  follow  AFSVA  developed  internal  control  procedures  to  protect  the integrity  of  the  slot  machine  program.    AFI  34-148  contains  specific  policies,  procedures,  and responsibilities for the operation of the slot machine program  (T-0). 6.1.1.  Waivers.    Air  Force  Services  Activity,  Programs  Directorate  (AFSVA/SVP)  and AFSVA/FM  approve,  in  writing,  all  waivers  to  established  policy  and  internal  control procedures for the slot machine program. 6.1.2.  Slot Machine Change Fund.  AFSVA/SVP/FM provides and establishes the kiosk fill-level  and  activity  change  fund  requirements  to  enable  proper  machine  operation  between harvest dates, and maintains sufficient cash levels for customer use.  The RM issues the slot machine change fund for use by the central cashier and activity for slot machine operations. 6.2.  Amusement  Machine  Operations.  The  installation  commander  approves  operation  of vending  and  amusement  machines  in  activities  which  are  not  part  of  the  Army  and  Air  Force Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  and  are  not  in  direct  competition  with  them  (refer  to  34-101,  Air Force  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR)  Programs  and  Use  Eligibility).    Within  the continental United States (CONUS), District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, establishment and operation of vending facilities/programs are subject to AFI  34-206,  Vending  Facility  Program  For  The  Blind  on  Air  Force  Property.    Vending  and amusement  machines may  be NAFI- or concessionaire-owned.  Specific controls  apply to  each type of machine. 6.3.  NAFI-Owned  Machines.  All  NAFI-owned  machines  should  have  meter  capability  and must  have  a  2-lock  system  (one  lock  for  the  machine  and  a  separate  lock  for  the  cashbox).  Control  procedures  require  the  activity  manager  keeps  the  machine  keys  and  the  NAF  AO controls the cashbox keys.  The RM develops a comprehensive OI to cover the removal of cash and the stocking of machines, including the internal controls specified below (T-3). 6.4.  Cash  Collection  of  NAFI-Owned  Machines.  To  remove  cash  from  a  machine,  an individual appointed by the FSS commander or director, obtains the cashbox key from the NAF AO.  6.4.1.  EXCEPTION:   When it is  not  practical  or economical  for the NAF AO to  safeguard the  cashbox  keys  for  machines  located  at  SV  activities,  the  FSS  commander  or  director appoints  the  individuals  who  will  keep  the  cashbox  keys  and  who  must  be  present  during cash  collection.    The  activity  manager  or  designee  counts  and  verifies  the  cash  amount collected, and returns the keys immediately to the NAF AO, (or to the individuals appointed to keep the keys)  (T-3). 6.4.2.  When a collection or exchange is made, the activity manager or designee verifies the amount of all cash removed, records the meter readings (when applicable), and signs the pre-numbered AF Form1400 with the individual appointed to make the collection.  The activity cashier completes an AF Form 1875 for vending and amusement machine receipts, attaches AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 43 the  original  AF  Form  1400,  and  files  with  all  other  AF  Forms  1875  for  the  day's  business.  Use the remaining two copies of AF Form 1400 as needed. 6.4.3.  When metering devices are available, the individual making the collection records the meter readings on AF Form 1400 and the activity manager or designee compares the number of plays to the cash collected. Several factors can cause an apparent cash variance, such as; defective  meters,  errors  in  recording  meter  readings,  and  counting  of  cash,  etc.    The following general guidelines apply: 6.4.3.1.  The  activity  manager  or  designee  flags  any  machine  having  a  cash  collection difference  in  excess  of  $5.00  and  checks  it  on  a  subsequent  report.    If  continuing variances exist, the activity manager notifies the RM or maintenance technician to correct or repair the problem. 6.4.3.2.  If willful misconduct is observed or suspected, the activity manager documents the  observation  and  notifies  the  RM  and  FSS  commander  or  director  who  takes  action according to Chapter 8. 6.4.4.  If the internal  control requirement for two individuals to make cash collections from NAFI-owned  vending  machines  is  deemed  impractical  or  uneconomical,  activity  managers may  request  approval  of  a  local  waiver  according  to  AFI  34-201.    The  RM  and  FSS commander  or  director  considers  these  factors  before  recommending  the  installation commander approve a waiver: 6.4.4.1.  Location  of  vending  machines  and  availability  of  two  individuals  to  empty  the machines 6.4.4.2.  Implementation of alternate control procedures to verify cash collected 6.4.4.3.  Existing manufacturer designed internal control devices, such as counters 6.5.  Restocking  Vending  Machines.  Activities  restock  machines  and  collect  cash  on  a scheduled  basis.  Make  the  last  collection  as  close  to  the  end  of  the  month  as  possible.    To restock,  use  AF  Form  1735,  NAF  Interfund  Purchase  Order,  or  AF  Form  2533,  Transfer Between Cost Centers, as appropriate, to record the transaction when supplying merchandise to vending machines from a NAF storeroom or from another activity. 6.6.  Customer Refunds.  Activity cashiers use AF Form 1401 to reimburse customers for cash lost because of inoperative machines.  The activity manager or designee approves all refunds. 6.7.  Concessionaire-Owned  Machines.  The  RM  specifies  the  merchandise,  key  and  cash controls,  and  cash  collection  procedures  for  all  concessionaire-owned  machines.    All  machines require written contracts which specify the number and type of machines covered, percentage of income accruing to the NAFI, and contain the following provisions: 6.7.1.  Amusement, music, and vending machines require meter capability and at least 2-lock system (one lock for the machine and one lock for the cashbox).  The concessionaire keeps the  machine  keys  and  the  NAF  AO  maintains  the  cashbox  keys  using  the  same  procedures specified for NAFI-owned machines (refer to paragraph  6.3). 6.7.2.  If a concessionaire cannot supply machines with a 2-lock system at a price comparable to  a  1-lock  machine,  the  RM  applies  the  following  controls  for  a  1-lock  machine  and specifies them in the contract: 44 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 6.7.2.1.  The NAF AO retains the one key to the machine in a locked pouch. 6.7.2.2.  The activity manager retains the key to the locked pouch. 6.7.2.3.  Coin  collection  and  maintenance  of  the  machines  requires  the  presence  of  an independent  observer  (IO)  from  the  NAF  AO  or  the  activity,  and  the  concessionaire's representative  (unless  the  concessionaire  provides  a  written  waiver  to  the  right  to  be present). 6.7.2.4.  Restock machines and collect cash on a scheduled basis, but not less than once each month.  If making more than one collection, make the last collection as close to the end of the month as possible. 6.8.  Cash  Collection  of  Concessionaire-Owned  Machines.  When  making  collections  or exchanges  from  concessionaire-owned  machines,  the  activity  manager  or  designee  verifies  the amount of all cash removed, records the meter readings, and with  the concessionaire, signs the pre-numbered  AF  Form  1400,  and  gives  a  copy  immediately  to  the  concessionaire.    When metering devices are available, the procedures in paragraph 6.4.3. apply. 6.8.1.  The activity cashier completes an AF Form 1875 for vending and amusement machine receipts, attaches a copy of the AF Form 1400, and files with the other AF Forms 1875 for the  day's  business.    The  cashier  attaches  the  original  AF  Form  1400  to  the  AF  Form  1876 forwarded to the NAF AO. 6.8.2.  The  NAF  AO  maintains  a  cumulative  record  of  receipts  and  other  records  necessary for ensuring receipt of all proceeds due the activity when concessionaire agreements do not provide for a sharing of the proceeds upon emptying machines.  The NAF AO general ledger entry  reflects  only  the  income  accruing  to  the  NAFI.    The  NAF  AO  uses  the  original  AF Form 1400 to support payment to the concessionaire of proceeds not shared upon emptying machines. 6.8.3.  The  RM  may  recommend  the  installation  commander  waive  the  procedural requirements  in  this  instruction  for  collecting  cash  from  concessionaire-owned  amusement, music, and vending machines on a case-by-case basis considering the number of and distance between machines. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 45 Chapter 7 CONTROL OF MERCHANDISE AND PROPERTY 7.1.  Merchandise  and  Property.  All  FSS  personnel  protect  NAF  assets  under  their  control.  The RM, or other authorized custodian, security  forces, and other responsible agencies provide staff and operational assistance as required. 7.1.1.  The  RM  prepares  OIs  providing  guidance  for  storing,  transporting,  and  utilizing  all property and monitoring compliance. 7.1.2.  Activity managers coordinate with  the security forces to  establish periodic patrols  of areas  storing  NAF  property,  particularly  during  night  hours.    Activity  managers  prepare  an OI outlining methods of surveillance for detecting and preventing misappropriation or misuse of property. 7.1.3.  Certain  kinds  of  NAF  assets,  such  as  aircraft,  firearms,  and  boats,  require  special protection  and  control  not  specifically  related  to  conservation,  but  to  safety.    Activity managers ensure protection of these assets meets the safety and control requirements in AFIs 31-101, 34-204, 34-208, 34-209, and individual activity operations procedures AFIs. 7.2.  Protecting  Resale  Merchandise.  The  degree  of  security  resale  merchandise  requires generally depends upon the size of the inventory, value of individual items, accessibility of the merchandise  to  patrons,  limitations  of  visual  surveillance,  sensitivity  of  resale  items  (firearms, liquor, etc.) and the physical characteristics of the facility  (T-0). 7.2.1.  Activity  personnel  do  not  leave  merchandise  unattended  during  resale  activity operating hours. 7.2.2.  Activity personnel secure the facility when the resale activity closes. 7.2.3.  Activity  managers  establish  a  single  entry  and  exit  control  point  for  surveillance  of walk-in type sales locations such as arts and crafts facilities and golf pro shops. 7.2.4.  Activity  personnel  need  to  take  care  and  consider  the  value  and  vulnerability  of location of items displayed to encourage sales. 7.2.5.  Activity managers use secure inside storage areas whenever possible.  Lock all outside storage  areas  unless  one  or  more  authorized  individuals  are  present,  and  use  lighting  and fencing for additional security. 7.3.  Central  Storeroom  Facilities.  The  FSS  commander  or  director  may  establish  a  central storeroom for receiving and distributing common supplies and merchandise to various activities.  Ensure  the  central  storeroom  is  a  secure  facility.    Where  possible,  the  facility  should  be  large enough to house all supplies and merchandise under a single roof, and: 7.3.1.  Provide adequate temperature controls in the facility to avoid damage to foodstuffs. 7.3.2.  Provide a loading dock convenient to the storeroom, if possible. 7.3.3.  Provide  secure  exterior  doors  and  windows  protecting  assets  and  minimize  the possibility  of  forced  entry,  (e.g.,  solid  doors  and  windows  and  strong  locks,  not  easily forced).  The use of window bars is recommended. 46 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 7.4.  Ticket  and  Tour  Operations.  These operations often maintain a substantial  inventory of tickets,  either  on  consignment  or  purchased  with  NAFs  which  must  be  protected.    NAF purchased  tickets  for  resale  are    assets  of  the  activity  included  in  the  definition  of  resalable inventory.  Activity personnel ensure protection of all tickets.  The activity manager issues an OI to control and protect all tickets  (T-0). 7.5.  Control and Use of Free or Donated Items.  Activities may accept free or donated items of nominal value to give away to FSS customers as a sales promotion according to AFI 34-201 and  AFI  34-108,  Commercial  Sponsorship  and  Sale  of  Advertising.    The  FSS  commander  or director approves procedures for controlling and utilizing free or donated items according to AFI 34-209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting. 7.6.  Consignment Inventory.  Consigned merchandise is not NAF property.  Activities account for  these  items  as  resale  merchandise  inventory  and  protect  them  accordingly.    The  activity manager issues an OI for control and protection of all consignment items.  Refer to Training Aid NA-5, Tickets Purchased or Consigned for Resale. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 47 Chapter 8 LOSSES AND COLLECTION ACTIONS 8.1.  Definition  of  Loss.  A  loss  occurs  when  NAF  assets  (including  cash  or  cash  equivalents, fixed  assets,  resale  merchandise,  consumable  supplies,  and  securities)  are  lost,  destroyed, damaged,  or  have  to  be  paid  out  as  a  result  of  a  natural  disaster,  accident,  unexplained disappearance, or  acts  of individuals, firms  or groups.   In addition,  the following situations are considered losses for the purposes of this chapter. 8.1.1.  Consider  any  unreconciled  asset,  liability,  or  equity  account  to  be  a  loss  if  the adjustment  is  required  to  bring  the  general  ledger  and  related  subsidiary  accounts  into balance, results in a decrease to fund equity.  For example, an unreconciled balance between the cash-in-bank and CMIP reports at the end of any given accounting period is a loss if the correcting entry reduces cash-in-bank for the NAFI. 8.1.2.  Claims submitted under the following NAF insurance programs are considered losses: 8.1.2.1.  Asset 8.1.2.2.  Liability  8.1.2.3.  Aero club hull 8.1.2.4.  Aero club liability. 8.2.  Basis for Loss.  A loss may be the result of simple negligence, gross negligence, or willful misconduct on the part of individuals or groups. 8.2.1.  Simple  Negligence  is  the  failure  to  act  as  a  reasonably  prudent  person  would  have acted under the same or similar circumstances. 8.2.2.  Gross Negligence is the failure to exercise even a slight degree of care, or an extreme departure  from  the  course  of  action  expected  of  a  reasonable  person,  all  circumstances considered. 8.2.3.  Willful  Misconduct  is    an  intentional  or  knowing  violation  of  rules  or  regulations including fraud and dishonesty. 8.2.4.  Joint  and  Several  Liability  is  the  combined  negligence,  gross  or  simple,  or  willful misconduct  of  two  or  more  persons  which  results  in  a  loss.    They  may  be  held  jointly  and severally  liable  for  the  full  amount  of  any  loss.    If  the  loss  resulted  from  the  willful misconduct of one or more persons and the negligence of another or others, all may be held jointly and severally liable.  In all other cases, assess liability on an individual basis. 8.2.5.  Proximate  Cause.    Proximate  Cause  is  the  cause  which,  in  a  natural  and  continuous sequence, unbroken by any new cause, produces the loss, and without it the loss would not have  occurred.    To  support  an  assessment  of  pecuniary  liability,  the  negligence  or  willful misconduct involved must constitute the proximate, rather than a remote, cause of the loss. 8.3.  Reporting Losses.  All AF military and civilian personnel have an individual responsibility for  preventing  losses,  and,  when  a  loss  occurs,  promptly  notifying  the  proper  authorities.  Commanders  are  responsible  for  prompt  detection,  proper  investigation,  and  appropriate corrective action.  Individuals reporting NAF losses are protected from reprisal  (T-0). 48 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 8.3.1.  Notify the security forces, the RM, and FSS commander or director of any type of loss resulting from forceful entry, or malicious damage to NAF property, as soon as discovered.  The security  forces may investigate such incidents  or refer them to  the Air Force Office of Special  Investigations  (AFOSI)  according  to  AFI  71-101V1,  Criminal  Investigations Program. 8.3.2.  Notify the AFOSI of incidents appearing to involve criminal activities. cash 8.3.3.  Notify  AFSVA/FMNTB  of overages/shortages between cash-in-bank and the CMIP at the end of any given accounting period. any  unreconciled  balances including 8.3.4.  Provide  notification  of  losses  resulting  in  claims  under  the  insurance  program according to AFI 34-208. 8.4.  Determining  Value.  AFSVA/FM  pays  a  claim  when  it  receives  reasonable  evidence indicating  the  installation  suffered  a  covered  loss  and  the  RM  has  accurately  determined  the value of the loss.  Where more than one item is involved, use the collective (total) amount of the loss as the basis for action under this chapter.  See AFI 34-208 to value insurance claims. 8.4.1.  Use the actual cash value to determine the amount of a loss. 8.4.2.  The value of a NAF property loss is the original cost less depreciation - the book value of the asset. Zero value or fully depreciated assets are not reimbursed. 8.4.3.  Compute the value of resalable inventories and supplies at cost or replacement value, whichever is less. 8.5.  Documenting  Losses.  Document each loss, even those caused by  acts  of nature.   Include sufficient information to show what happened, who was responsible, what should be done about it,  and  how  to  prevent  similar  losses  in  the  future.    It  is  not  necessary  to  duplicate  the investigative work of the security forces, AFOSI, or other federal  and local  agencies.  Security forces  reports  may  become  part  of  the  Services  case  file.    Do  not  include  AFOSI  reports  of investigation in the case file; use extracts and summaries according to AFI 71-101V1.  Comply with all restrictions and instructions placed on the investigative reports of other federal and local agencies.    Since  the  investigative  reports  will  focus  on  criminal  allegations,  conduct  other inquiries as necessary to determine the administrative actions needed to reduce the potential for future losses (T-0). 8.6.  Resolving Losses.  Resolve losses based on the dollar amount and type of loss. 8.6.1.  For losses up to and including $50, the activity manager conducts an informal review, documents the results, and with  the written approval  of the RM, files the documentation in the activity.   If the review indicates negligence (simple or gross) or willful misconduct, the activity manager notifies the RM and the FSS commander or director immediately so further action may be taken.  The RM reviews activity records periodically, documents the review, and  determines  if  appropriate  action  was  taken.    The  RM  refers  the  matter  to  the  FSS commander or director for further action if appropriate action was not taken. 8.6.2.  For  losses  over  $50  up  to  and  including  $250,  use  a  memorandum  attached  to  the cashier's report for cash shortages.  The activity  manager conducts  a review and provides a brief written explanation to  the RM. If the review indicates negligence (simple or gross) or AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 49 willful misconduct, the activity manager notifies the FSS commander or director immediately to take further action. 8.6.3.  For losses over $250 up to and including $2,500, and for losses of $250 or less which appear to involve negligence or willful misconduct, the FSS commander or director appoints an  individual  to  conduct  an  inquiry.    Inquiries  are  less  formal,  minimal  time  consumption, and less costly than investigations.  The individual conducting the inquiry examines available reports and documents pertinent to the loss, and interviews individuals having knowledge of the  circumstances  surrounding  the  loss.    Affidavits  are  not  required.    The  RM  reviews  the report  of  inquiry  for  completeness  and  submits  it  to  the  FSS  commander  or  director  for action.    Refer  reports  of  losses  appearing  to  involve  simple  or  gross  negligence  or  willful misconduct  through  the  FM  and  the  legal  office  to  the  installation  commander  for  action.  The report of inquiry must specifically address the following (T-0): 8.6.3.1.  The nature and amount of loss. 8.6.3.2.  The date and place where the loss was discovered. 8.6.3.3.  The circumstances under which the loss occurred. 8.6.3.4.  The  adequacy  of  corrective  actions  taken  or  recommendations  for  appropriate corrective actions to be taken. 8.6.3.5.  Any indications of negligence (simple or gross) or willful misconduct, and 8.6.3.6.  The name, grade, and SSN of the person or persons who caused or contributed to the  loss,  if  known,  and  an  appropriate  recommendation  to  assess  or  not  to  assess pecuniary liability.  If employed by the Federal Government, indicate if paid by APFs or NAFs. 8.6.4.  Instead  of,  or  in  addition  to  an  inquiry,  the  installation  commander  may  require  an investigation whenever he or she deems such action necessary to protect the interests of the Air Force, or to determine more accurately whether pecuniary liability is properly assessable or claims action is warranted. 8.6.5.  For losses which exceed $2,500, the installation commander appoints an investigating officer,  independent  of  any  NAFI  under  the  purview  of  the  NAFs  Council  to  conduct  an investigation.  AFOSI agents will not be tasked to conduct an investigation pursuant to AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.  The investigating officer complies with  the  investigative  guidance  provided  in  AFI  90-301,  Inspector  General  Complaints Resolution.  Conduct investigations as expeditiously as possible to  allow the commander to act  on  the  completed  report  within  60  days  after  discovery  of  the  loss.    If  extenuating circumstances make it impossible to meet this deadline, the investigating officer submits an interim  status  report  to  the  commander  not  less  than  5  days  before  the  end  of  the  60-day period.    Provide  a  copy  of  the  interim  report  to  the  RM.    The  report  of  investigation  must specifically  address  the  elements  in  paragraph  8.6.3.    The  RM  reviews  the  report  of investigation  for  completeness,  and  submits  the  report  through  the  FSS  commander  or director, the FM, and the legal office, to the installation commander for action  (T-0). 8.7.  Assessing  Pecuniary  Liability.  Reports of inquiry and investigation must identify, to  the extent  practical,  those  whose  actions  caused  or  contributed  to  a  loss,  and  make  specific recommendation  as to  whether or not  the commander should hold  them financially responsible 50 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 for the loss and damages.  The investigating officer prepares recommendations to the installation commander for assessing pecuniary liability according to the instructions and the definitions of simple negligence, gross negligence, and willful misconduct (T-0). 8.7.1.  Recommendations to Assess Pecuniary Liability.  Reports of inquiry and investigation must  identify,  to  the  extent  practical,  those  whose  actions  caused  or  contributed  to  the  loss and  make  specific  recommendation  as  to  whether  or  not  the  commander  should  hold  them financially  responsible  for  the  loss  and  damages.    Prepare  recommendations  within  these guidelines. 8.7.1.1.  A  military  member  of  the  uniformed  services  or  a  civilian  employee  of  the Federal Government (APF or NAF), may be held pecuniary liable for a loss caused by his or her gross negligence or willful misconduct.  In cases where gross negligence or willful misconduct is found, involuntary collection from pay cannot exceed total liability. 8.7.2.  In  addition  to  the  above,  NAFI-assigned  or  employed  personnel  on  duty  (including military assigned, and APF and NAF employees) may be held pecuniary liable for any loss caused  by  their  simple  negligence.  In  cases  where  simple  negligence  is  found,  limit involuntary collection from pay to one month's base pay. 8.7.3.  Aero  club  members  may  also  be  held  pecuniary  liable  for  any  loss  caused  by  their simple negligence.  Limit liability for aero club members, based on their simple negligence to $500. 8.7.4.  When  a  loss  is  caused  by  individuals,  firms,  or  groups  other  than  those  identified above, the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) uses gross or simple negligence, willful misconduct, or any other conduct  creating liability recognized by the civil  jurisdiction in  which the loss occurred  as  the  basis  for  claims  action  under  AFI  51-502,    Personnel  and  Government Recovery Claims. 8.7.5.  Government  employees  (including  assigned  military  personnel,  APF  civilians,  and NAF civilians) cannot be assessed pecuniary liability for NAFs paid out to satisfy third-party claims resulting from  their conduct  while acting within the scope of their federal  offices or employment (28 USC 2679 (b)). 8.7.6.  Limit assessments of joint and several pecuniary liability cases where the loss resulted from the combined action or inaction of two or more persons. 8.7.7.  When  the  investigating  or  inquiring  officer  intends  to  recommend  assessment  of pecuniary liability, he or she advises each named person of the basis on which he or she may be held  pecuniary liable.  Each person is  also  advised he or she may submit  any matters in mitigation  or  defense.    The  investigating  or  inquiring  officer  reviews  all  facts  and circumstances,  including  any  matters  in  mitigation  or  defense,  and  includes  them  in  the report  of  investigation  with  appropriate  recommendations  for  action  by  the  installation commander. 8.7.8.  Action by the Commander.  Submit completed reports through the FM and SJA to the installation commander for action.  The installation commander carefully reviews and acts on each report, takes proper action with respect to those who caused or contributed to the loss, and implements corrective measures to reduce the potential for recurrence. AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 51 8.7.9.  Commanders  have  a  wide  range  of  options  in  dealing  with  such  matters.    Do  not overlook the normal range of administrative and disciplinary actions described in personnel policy  directives  and  instructions.  Additional  training  and  more  clearly  defined  procedures may also be of value in reducing the potential for recurrence. 8.7.10.  Where appropriate, the installation commander assesses pecuniary liability.  Advises the person held pecuniary liable of his or her appeal rights as prescribed in 8.8.  Notifies all persons  held  jointly  and  severally  liable  each  remain  individually  liable  for  the  total uncollected  amount  until  the  entire  amount  of  the  loss  is  paid.    In  the  interest  of  fairness, those responsible for collections should generally attempt to collect an equal part from each person  held  liable.    When  such  attempts  fail,  collection  in  full  is  made  from  the  person  or those persons who are liable and from whom collection can be made. 8.7.11.  When the loss results from negligence or willful misconduct of a military member of the  uniformed  services,  or  a  civilian  employee  of  the  Federal  Government,  the  installation commander refers the file to the RM.  The RM takes collection action, where appropriate. 8.7.12.  When the loss was caused by  any  other  person's negligence, willful misconduct,  or any  other  conduct  creating  liability  recognized  by  the  civil  jurisdiction  in  which  the  loss occurred,  the  installation  commander  refers  the  file  to  the  servicing  SJA  for  appropriate claims action under AFI 51-502. 8.8.  Appeals.  Appeals  of  Assessments  of  Pecuniary  Liability.    Military  members  or  civilian employees  of  the  Federal  Government  (APF  or  NAF)  may  appeal  the  assessment  of  pecuniary liability. 8.8.1.  Submit appeals within 3 months of the assessment to the installation commander who assessed pecuniary liability, or his  or her successor.  State specifically the alleged errors or irregularities relied upon by the appellant. 8.8.2.  The  installation  commander  furnishes  one  copy  of  the  appeal  file  to  the  appellant's paying office responsible for processing the indebtedness.  The paying office files the copy of  the  appeal  file  with  the  indebtedness  notice  and  suspends  collection  action  until  a  final decision on the appeal has been made. 8.8.3.  Upon  receiving  an  appeal,  the  installation  commander  verifies  the  facts  contained  in the  appeal  to  the  extent  possible,  secures  a  legal  review  and  opinion  on  the  appeal,  and reconsiders  the  assessment  action  giving  full  consideration  to  the  matters  presented  in  the appeal.    The  installation  commander  then  revokes  or  sustains  the  assessment  action,  or requires further inquiry or investigation, and resubmission of the report. 8.8.4.  If  further  inquiry  or  investigation  is  required,  the  installation  commander  secures  a legal review and opinion on the revised report and appeal, reconsiders the assessment action, again  giving full consideration to  the matters presented in  the appeal,  and either revokes or sustains the assessment action. 8.8.4.1.  If the installation commander  revokes the assessment  action, he  or she informs the appellant, and notifies the paying office to refund all previous collections. 8.8.4.2.  If the installation commander sustains the assessment action, he or she forwards the  appeal  to  the  AF  Services  Law  Division,  AFSVA/JA  ,  2261  Hughes  Ave,  Ste.  156, Lackland AFB TX,  78235-9852 with a local legal review and opinion on the appeal file; 52 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 and  prepares  a  memorandum  recommending  approval  or  disapproval  of  the  appeal  for submission to AF JAA-S.  The appeal file must contain the following: 8.8.4.2.1.  The memorandum 8.8.4.2.2.  The appeal 8.8.4.2.3.  The installation-level JA review 8.8.4.2.4.  The assessment of pecuniary liability 8.8.4.2.5.  The report of inquiry or investigation 8.8.4.2.6.  Any  other  documentation  considered  pertinent  to  the  assessment  and appeal. 8.8.4.3.  After  review  of  the  appeal  file,  AFSVA/JA    forwards  it  to  the  AFSVA Commander for action. 8.8.4.4.  The  decision  of  the  AFSVA  Commander  on  the  appeal  is  final.    The  AFSVA Commander may approve, disapprove, or modify the assessment action, or return the file for  further  inquiry  or  investigation  or  analysis.    The  AFSVA  Commander  notifies  the appellant  of  the  decision  on  the  appeal  through  command  channels,  and  instructs  the appellant's paying office to refund previous collections or to resume collection action as appropriate. 8.9.  Collection  Actions.  The  RM  immediately  initiates  collection  actions  on  all  losses  where the  installation  commander  assesses  pecuniary  liability.    The  RM  actively  pursues  restitution from  individuals’  assessed  pecuniary  liability  for  all  losses  including  those  covered  by  the  Air Force Insurance Fund.  The NAF AO establishes a claim against the responsible person, sets up a file for all pertinent documents, and: 8.9.1.  Notifies  AFSVA/SVXHI  2261  Hughes  Ave,  Suite  156,  Lackland  AFB  TX  78236-9854, the responsible individual for the claim intends to make restitution. 8.9.1.1.  Forwards all payments to offset the payment made from the Air Force Insurance Fund  immediately  upon  receipt  to  AFSVA/SVXHI,  2261  Hughes  Avenue,  Suite  #156, Lackland AFB TX  78236-9854. the  claim, 8.9.2.  Upon  notification  from  AFSVA/SVXHI AFSVA/FM  establishes  a  receivable  in  the  accounting  system  for  the  amount  owed,  and keeps AFSVA/SVXHI advised of the payment status. to  expect  restitution  of 8.9.3.  The  servicing  staff  judge  advocate  pursues  claims  action  against  parties  other  than members  of  the  uniformed  services  and  employees  of  the  Federal  Government.    The  RM establishes a claim file and tracks restitution in these cases. 8.9.3.1.  The FSS must give the debtor the opportunity to voluntarily pay the debt (T-0). 8.9.3.2.  If the debtor does not  voluntarily pay the debt,  the RM personally  reviews and verifies the accuracy and validity of the debt from an administrative viewpoint, and takes collection action on the indebtedness as instructed in this chapter. 8.9.3.3.  If  the  debtor  disputes  the  validity  of  the  debt,  he  or  she  may  submit  an  appeal through  the  RM  and  the  FSS  commander  or  director  to  the  installation  commander.  AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 53 When  a  debtor  submits  an  appeal,  the  RM  suspends  collection  until  the  installation commander  determines  the  outcome  of  the  appeal.    Follow  the  appeal  procedures  in paragraph  8.8.    EXCEPTION:    This  limitation  does  not  apply  when  the  individual involved is an employee who the commander expects to terminate his or her employment (voluntarily  or  involuntarily).  In  any  such  case,  follow  the  collection  procedures  in paragraph 8.11. 8.9.3.4.  The  installation  commander  has  the  authority  to  render  final  decisions  on appeals involving claims of $5,000 or less.  Retain copies of all decisions in the LOF file of the NAFI involved.  The installation commander has 15 calendar days from receipt of the  appeal  to  render  a  decision.    Forward  all  appeals  of  claims  over  $5,000  through command  channels  to  AFSVA/JA  (Services  Legal  Office)  for  further  review  and recommendation to the AFSVA Commander. 8.9.3.5.  Claims Covered by Commercial Insurance.  Claims asserted against a person for any conduct causing a loss covered by commercial insurance, require the RM to: 8.9.3.6.  Furnish  the  insurance  company  a  preliminary  notification  of  the  loss  involved.  Furnish proof of the loss under the terms of the insurance contract. 8.9.3.7.  Notify  the  insurance  company  of  any  collections  made  reducing  the  final company’s liability. 8.10.  Claims  Involving  Losses  or  Indebtedness.  When  initiating  collection  action  for  other losses  or  indebtedness,  excluding  returned  checks  and  recourse  accounts,  caused  by  a  member (or  family  member)  of  the  uniformed  services  or  an  employee  of  the  Federal  Government,  the RM  forwards  a  statement  of  account  with  a  request  for  payment  to  the  person  held  pecuniary liable.  Certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal delivery is used for accountability, to ensure the availability of proof of collection efforts.  If the individual responsible for the loss or indebtedness does not settle the claim outright, the RM takes the following action: 8.10.1.  NAF employee indebtedness.  The RM authorizes payroll deductions, not to exceed one-fourth  of  gross  pay  due  or  to  become  due  to  the  employee  from  the  NAFI.    Refer  to AFMAN 34-310, NAF Personnel Program Management and Administration Procedures, for determining  whether  a  disciplinary  action  against  the  NAF  employee  is  appropriate.  EXCEPTION:  Payroll deductions may be increased or all payouts withheld if the employee terminates or leadership becomes aware of impending employee termination of employment. 8.10.2.  Civil  service  employee  indebtedness.  The RM forwards a claim, if a civil service employee  responsible  for  the  loss  or  indebtedness  does  not  settle  the  loss  or  indebtedness outright to the SSC for submission to the Treasury Offset Program. 8.10.3.  Collecting  from  FSS  customers  for  debts  incurred  by  family  members  or guests.  The RM may not involuntarily withhold money from an FSS customer for amounts due NAFIs resulting from debts incurred, or returned checks negotiated by family members or guests of the customer.  This is true even for a returned check drawn on a joint checking account of the customer.  However, a deduction from pay, or other monies due the customer can be made when he or she provides an appropriately worded consent agreement. The SSC requires consent agreements only when the debt is incurred by a family member or guest of the military member.  Attach a copy of the consent agreement to the SSC Account Placement 54 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 Form.    This  form  is  a  word  document  and  the  collection  account  number  will  be  assigned once received by the SSC. 8.10.3.1.  Following  is  an  example  of  an  acceptable  consent  agreement  covering  debts and  returned  checks  of  the  customer,  and  his  or  her  family  members  and  guests:    "In consideration of the (NAFI involved) accepting payment by check for goods or services, cashing personal checks, and accepting credit sales for myself, my family members, and guests,    I  hereby  authorize  a  deduction  from  my  appropriated  fund  or  nonappropriated fund  pay  or  other  moneys  due  me  for  any  debt  (including  any  associated  processing charge) or charge that is not timely paid." 8.10.3.2.  Activities can also obtain consent agreements in advance.  The customer signs a deduction authorization to pay any unpaid debt to be incurred and redeem any unpaid returned check to be negotiated by the customer, or his or her family members or guests.  Activities should include consent agreements in the format of the membership application to be modified to apply to any NAFI.  (Reference membership application format in AFI 34-272, Air Force Club Program.) 8.10.3.3.  The  activity  and  NAF  AO  can  also  obtain  consent  agreements  during  normal debt  collection  processing.    Consent  agreements  obtained  after  the  indebtedness  occurs must  include  the  amount  of  the  debt,  the  date  of  the  debt,  the  customer’s  SSN,  and  the customer's signature.  8.10.3.4.  A  customer  may  withdraw  a  consent  agreement  at  any  time,  in  writing; however,  deductions  are  authorized  for  any  indebtedness  incurred  under  the  agreement before the date the NAFI receives the written withdrawal. 8.10.3.5.  Other  military  services  will  not  accept  consent  agreements  pertaining  to  Air Force NAFI debts signed by their civilian employees.  Activities must consider this when accepting checks from these individuals.  8.10.4.  Collecting from FSS Customers.  The SSC Debt Collection Branch is responsible for processing  Military  Pay  Orders  (MPO)  and  TOP  debt  collections  procedures  for  losses  or indebtedness,  including  returned  checks,  caused  by  a  member  (or  family  member)  of  the uniformed  services  or  an  employee  of  the  Federal  Government.    For  collections  other  than returned checks and recourse accounts, the RM pursues collection of the customer debt until it is determined uncollectible.  Once the debt is determined uncollectible, it is forwarded to the SSC for MPO or TOP collection.  For losses or debts remaining with the installation for collection until deemed uncollectible, the RM: 8.10.4.1.  Forwards a statement of account with a request for payment to the person held pecuniary liable. Certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal delivery is used for accountability to ensure the availability of proof of collection efforts. 8.10.4.2.  Offset  as much of the claim  as possible.  If a NAF employee was responsible for  the  loss  or  indebtedness  and  does  not  settle  the  claim  outright,  the  RM  authorizes payroll  deductions  not  to  exceed  one-fourth  of  gross  pay  due  or  to  become  due  the employee  from  the  NAFI.    EXCEPTION:    Payroll  deductions  may  be  increased  or  all payouts  withheld  if  the  employee  terminates  employment.    See  8.11  for  indebtedness collection procedures, and AFMAN 34-310, NAF Personnel Program Management and AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 55 Administration  Procedures,  to  determine  whether  disciplinary  action  against  a  NAF employee is appropriate. 8.10.4.3.  Forwards  the  claim,  if  a  civil  service  employee  responsible  for  the  loss  or indebtedness does not settle the loss or indebtedness outright or grant written consent for a  deduction  from  his  or  her  pay,  to  the  Civilian  Personnel  Flight  (CPF)  servicing  the employee for action under AFI 36-703, Civilian Conduct and Responsibility.  8.10.4.4.  Contacts the individual by telephone (when practical) and by a written demand for  payment  if  a  member  of  any  military  service  was  responsible  for  the  loss  or indebtedness.  If the individual does not settle the loss or indebtedness outright, or grant written consent  to  a deduction from  his  or her active or retired pay, the  RM forwards a claim  for  the  loss  or  indebtedness  to  the  SSC  for  submission  to  the  Treasury  Offset Program. 8.11.  Collection  of  Overpayments  from  NAF  Employees.  Deductions from  the pay of NAF employees without their consent are permitted to satisfy debts to their employing NAFIs arising out  of  erroneous  or  excessive  payments  of  wages,  allowances,  differentials,  or  benefits.    This also includes the value of annual and sick leave advanced under AFMAN 34-310, but not earned or otherwise repaid, when the employee retires, resigns, or is otherwise separated.  FSS uses the following  procedures  for  collection  of  overpayments  resulting  from  payroll  and  entitlement errors  made  within  the  activity  or  NAF  AO,  administrative  or  managerial  error,  or  erroneous employee provided information. 8.11.1.  The  NAF-Human  Resources  Section  (NAF-HR)  prepares  AF  Form  2545,  NAFI Notification of Personnel Action, correcting the action which caused the overpayment.  (This is not required when the error is made within the activity or NAF AO.) 8.11.2.  The SSC computes the amount of debt owed and notifies the servicing NAF AO who then notifies the employee, in writing, of the overpayment, the amount of overpayment, the conditions that caused the overpayment, that repayment is required, and the options available for making repayment.  The NAF AO advises the employee they have 15 days from receipt of  the  letter  advising  of  the  overpayment  to  request  a  review  to  waive  the  indebtedness  or negotiate a grievance. 8.11.3.  The  NAF  AO  also  advises  the  employee  of  the  failure  to  agree  to  reasonable repayment procedures or waiver approval will result in an automatic payroll deduction of an established amount from each pay period not to exceed one-fourth of gross pay. 8.11.4.  Activity  management,  representatives  of  the  NAF  AO,  and  the  employee  should jointly  come  to  an  agreement  as  to  the  method  of  repayment  ensuring  full  reimbursement without  creating  undue  hardship  on  the  employee,  but  ensures  full  reimbursement  to  the employing NAFI as soon as possible.  The following methods are available: 8.11.4.1.  The NAF AO accepts cash payment if the employee chooses to pay cash. 8.11.4.2.  Adjust  future  earnings  if  agreed  upon  by  all  parties  (for  example,  decreasing the  appropriate  items  of  pay  on  subsequent  payrolls).    The  rate  of  deduction  cannot exceed  two-thirds  (for  a  one  time  reimbursement)  of  the  employee's  gross  pay  after mandatory deductions. 56 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 8.11.4.3.  If  collection  cannot  be  made  as  stated  above,  deduct  an  established  amount from  each  succeeding  paycheck.    This  amount  cannot  exceed  one-fourth  of  gross  pay.  EXCEPTION:    This  limitation  on  the  amount  deducted  does  not  apply  when  the employee  involved  is  expected  to  terminate  his  or  her  employment  (voluntarily  or involuntarily).  In any such case, effect deduction at levels ensuring full collection when possible,  and  maximum  collection  if  full  collection  is  not  possible.    If  full  collection  is not  effected  before  termination  and  from  termination  entitlements,  a  valid  indebtedness remains in force for the uncollected amount. 8.11.4.4.  Notify SSC when debt is satisfied to stop deductions. 8.11.5.  If  the  employee  doubts  the  validity  of  the  indebtedness,  or  believes  the  amount  or method of collection creates an unreasonable hardship, the employee may within 15 calendar days  of  receipt  of  the  letter  advising  of  the  overpayment,  exercise  one  of  the  following options: 8.11.5.1.  Request a review of the debt or the collection method. 8.11.5.2.  Use any negotiated grievance procedure available. 8.11.5.3.  The  employee  submits  a  request  for  review  through  the  RM  and  the  FSS commander or director to the installation commander.  Include details of the case and any appropriate background documents.  The installation commander evaluates each request in a manner which assures the application of equity and good conscience.  Upon receipt of  a  request  for  review  or  a  negotiated  grievance,  the  RM  suspends  collection  of  the overpayment until notified of the installation commander's decision.  EXCEPTION:  This suspension of payment does not apply when the employee is expected to terminate his or her employment (voluntarily or involuntarily). 8.11.5.4.  The installation commander has authority to render final decisions on requests for review.  The RM retains copies of all decisions in the LOF file of the NAFI.  Except in  unusual  circumstances  (documented  in  the  file),  the  installation  commander  should render a decision within 15 calendar days from receipt of the review request. 8.11.5.5.  A  valid  NAFI  claim  resulting  from  an  erroneous  payment  of  wages, allowances, differentials, or benefits may be waived or compromised when the erroneous payment was made through administrative error, and: 8.11.5.6.  There  is  no  indication  of  fraud,  misrepresentation,  fault,  or  lack  of  good  faith on the part of the requesting employee, and 8.11.5.7.  The debtor is incapable of paying both now and in the foreseeable future, or 8.11.5.8.  The debtor cannot be located, or 8.11.5.9.  The cost of recovery will exceed the expected recovery, or 8.11.5.10.  The claim is not legally supportable, or 8.11.5.11.  Available evidence does not substantiate the claim. 8.11.6.  The  installation  commander  approves  waivers  for  claims  involving  $2,500  or  less.  The installation commander must carefully consider all of the information available and each element  of  the  waiver  criteria.  For  example,  even  though  a  waiver  seems  justified  for  an AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 57 erroneous  payment  due  to  an  administrative  error  when  there  is  no  indication  of  fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the NAF employee, the criterion involving the debtor's ability to pay now or in the foreseeable future is a factor of importance. 8.11.6.1.  Overpayments  represent  assets  rightfully  belong  to  a  NAFI.    Unless  the requesting employee provides sufficient information or evidence to support a reasonable conclusion he or she is incapable of repaying both currently and in the foreseeable future, his or her request should be denied. 8.11.6.2.  Accordingly, encourage employees to provide as much pertinent information as possible  to  ensure  their  requests  have  a  fair  chance  of  approval.    Do  not  impose  undue financial hardships in requiring repayment of funds.  However, bear in mind recipients of overpayment  have  received  NAF  assets  to  which  they  are  not  entitled.    The  effect  is  a negative impact on the availability of NAFs for their intended purposes. 8.11.6.3.  The  installation  commander  forwards  requests  for  waiver  of  claims  involving more review  and recommendation to the AFSVA Commander for final decision. through  channels than  $2,500 to  AFSVA/JA for further 8.12.  Uncollected  Losses  or  Indebtedness  (other  than  returned  checks  and  recourse accounts).  When it is reasonably certain losses or indebtedness cannot be collected through the above  procedures  within  120  days,  (except  when  an  appeal  is  pending),  the  RM  notifies  the NAFI activity manager the claim is uncollectible and writes it off.  The RM approves write-offs of  $2,500  or  less.    The  installation  commander  approves  write  offs  of  more  than  $2,500.    The RM documents write offs of losses and indebtedness according to AFI 34-209, and forwards to the SSC to process through the TOP. 8.12.1.  If none of the above procedures results in collection of the loss or indebtedness, the RM seeks counsel from the servicing SJA on uncollected losses or indebtedness of more than $100 but less than $600, and determines whether to pursue further administrative action. 8.12.2.  Prior  to  transfer  of  accounts,  the  NAF  AO  sends  a  final  debt  notice  to  the  debtor's last  known  address.  Ensure  the  debt  notice  letter  informs  the  debtor  unless  the  NAF  AO receives full payment of the entire outstanding balance within 15 days of the date of the final notice,  their  delinquent  account  will  be  referred  for  TOP  collection.    The  RM  forwards  all pertinent facts and documents and evidence of collectability, as follows: 8.12.2.1.  Send all eligible accounts to AFSVA/SVTR for submission to the TOP.  Send accounts  no  more  than  180  days  delinquent,  as  experience  indicates  collection  of  older accounts is less successful. 8.12.2.2.  Send  claims  exceeding  $600  arising  in  the  United  States,  its  territories  and possessions, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, other than those of AAFES, to the servicing SJA for further collection assistance or further forwarding to AFSVA/JA. 8.12.3.  For claims of $600 or more other than those stated above: 8.12.3.1.  If  the  RM  does  not  expect  the  debtor  to  return  to  the  United  States,  its territories and possessions,  the District  of Columbia, or Puerto Rico, he or she provides the  case  file  to  the  servicing  SJA.    The  SJA  forwards  it  to  the  MAJCOM  SJA  of  the overseas  command  in  which  the  debt  arose  to  review  and  determine  whether  to  pursue further  administrative  collection  action.    The  MAJCOM  SJA  takes  any  further 58 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 administrative  collection  action.    If  such  action  fails,  or  if  the  MAJCOM  SJA  deems further administrative collection action is inappropriate, he or she forwards the case file to AFSVA/JA along with recommendations for disposition. 8.12.3.2.  If the debtor has returned to the United States, its territories or possessions, the District  of  Columbia,  or  Puerto  Rico,  or  is  expected  to  do  so  shortly,  the  RM  sends  all pertinent facts and the case file to the servicing SJA for forwarding to AFSVA/JA. 8.12.4.  Consolidate  debts  for  individual(s)  with  other  government  agencies.    Under  the provisions of AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation,  AFSVA/JA may submit aggregate totals of $600 or more to the United States Attorney for collection.  The RM submits request for collection through the servicing SJA to AFSVA/JA. 8.13.  Uncollected  Losses  or  Indebtedness for  Returned  Checks  and  Recourse Accounts.  The  SSC  Debt  Collection  Branch  is  responsible  for  processing  debt  collection  of returned checks and recourse accounts.  The SSC may write off accounts up to $2,500.  Write-off amounts over $2,500 must be presented to the applicable installation NAFs Council for approval.  After  the  NAF  AO  notifies  the  SSC  of  the  installation  commander’s  approval  of  the  write-off, the SSC processes all eligible debts for collection via the TOP.  All payments received from TOP are sent directly back to the installation where the debt originated via CMIP  (T-0). 8.14.  Withholding  of  Pay  and  Allowances.  When  a  consent  statement  is  available  and  all collection attempts have failed, pay and allowances may be withheld from civilian employees as prescribed  in  AFMAN  34-310.    The  RM  submits  all  available  paperwork  to  the  SSC  for submission to the TOP. 8.15.  Garnishment  of  Pay.  Federal  pay  (including  pay  of  NAF  employees)  is  subject  to garnishment under Public Law 93-647, as amended by Public Law 95-30, and under Public Law 103-94.  Implementing regulations are in 5 C.F.R. 581 and 582. 8.15.1.  .  Effective 3 February 1994, pay of federal employees can be garnished the same as pay of any non-federal individual. 8.15.2.  Legal  processes  involve  the  garnishment  of  pay  of  AF  NAF  employees  must  be served on AFSVA/JA.  Accomplish service only by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service  (T-0). 8.15.3.  Any  federal  employee  receiving  such  process  in  the  course  of  his  or  her  duties pertaining  to  a  NAF  employee,  was  served  by  certified  or  registered  mail,  return  receipt requested,  or  by  personal  service,  must  immediately  forward  it  to  AFSVA/JA.    Ensure  the forwarding correspondence identifies the named employee's employing NAFI (e.g., the Joint Base  San  Antonio-Randolph  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  Fund),  and  forward  all documentation received and the envelope in which it was received.  Service of process is not considered accomplished until AFSVA/JA receives it  (T-0). 8.15.4.  If  a  NAF  employee  questions  the  validity  of  a  legal  process,  the  employee  must challenge it in the appropriate court.  The AF will not litigate or otherwise judge the validity of any such challenge  (T-0). 8.15.5.  Any legal process must contain the name of the employee and the employee's SSN.  Deliver  any process  received without sufficient information  to  identify the employee to  the AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 59 servicing SJA for return directly to the issuing authority with an explanation of the deficiency  (T-0). 8.15.6.  Upon  receipt  of  a  properly  served,  valid  legal  process,    AFSVA/JA  advises  the employee's  NAF  payroll  office  of  the  amount  to  be  garnished  and  provides    a  copy  of  the legal  process.    The  employee's  NAF  payroll  office  complies  with  AFSVA/JA’s  pay withholding instructions upon receipt  (T-0). 8.16.  Administrative  Garnishments  for  NAFIs.  Under  31  U.S.C.  3720D,  the  Chief  Legal Counsel, AFSVA/JA, or designee, may garnish the disposable pay of any individual indebted to an AF NAFI.  This authority does not extend to the pay of Federal personnel. 8.16.1.  The amount garnished during any pay period may not  exceed fifteen percent  of the individual’s disposable pay. 8.16.2.  Procedures are prescribed in 31 CFR Part 285.  Claim files will be processed through the  AFSVA/JA  for  action  under  this  paragraph.    Follow  the  same  procedures  for  file submission as outlined in paragraph 8.12 above. 8.16.3.  Amounts  collected  will  be  distributed  to  the  appropriate  NAFIs  through  the  Air Force Central NAF CMIP. 8.17.  Claims  Arising  Out  of  Contract  Arrangements.  The  RM  refers  all  claims  to  the contracting  officer  for  appropriate  action.    Adjudicate  and  settle  claims  arising  out  of  contract arrangements (e.g., contracts, leases or purchase orders), either for or against a NAFI, using the procedures  provided  by  the  disputes  clauses  in  the  contracts.    EXCEPTION:      In  cases  where established procedures do not apply to certain types of claims arising out of NAFI operations, the contracting officer submits the case through channels to the AFSVA Commander for resolution. 8.18.  NAF  Asset  Insurance  Program.  For  a  loss  of  an  asset  covered  by  the  asset  insurance program, file claims according to AFI 34-208. 60 AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 9 CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS 9.1.  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Suspended Operations.  In areas subject to recurring  weather,  geographic,  or  climate  events,  the  FSS  commander  or  director  ensures  the installation  has  a  MOU  with  another  location,  which  provides  a  contingency  plan  to  guarantee continuous  operation  and  protection  of  NAF  assets  in  the  aftermath  of  a  natural  disaster  or conflict.   The MOU is  essential to  guarantee  continuous operation and must be all inclusive to provide  (T-0). 9.1.1.  Computer support 9.1.2.  Software availability and protection 9.1.3.  Hard copy storage and recovery 9.1.4.  Asset protection 9.1.5.  Lines of responsibility/accountability 9.2.  Following  a  Natural  Disaster.  The  RM,  FSS  commander  or  director,  and  installation commander assess overall damage.  While determining the feasibility of continuing operations, they  ensure  continued  protection  of  all  remaining  NAF  assets  and  property  by  the  following means: 9.2.1.  Conduct all salvage, recovery, and reconstruction efforts with the utmost attention to safety. 9.2.2.  Empty safes and secure all cash and cash equivalents. 9.2.3.  Safeguard highly pilferable items. 9.2.4.  Ensure items dangerous to one's health are destroyed or confiscated. 9.2.5.  Assess damage to the NAF AO  and determine requirements for recovery. 9.2.6.  Determine if off-site processing is necessary.  If so, arrange for transport of only those records necessary to conduct business. 9.3.  Continuing  Operations.  When  total  destruction  of  the  NAF  AO  has  occurred,  after securing the processing site and workplace, avoid or minimize future losses by: 9.3.1.  Securing  as  many  fixed  assets  as  reasonably  possible.    Use  tents  or  trucks  to  store property,  depending  upon  the  condition  of  the  facilities.    Destroy  or  use  all  perishable inventories.  Maintain an inventory of disposed items.  Request additional vehicle support if needed, from nearby installations. 9.3.2.  Securing as many resale items and other highly pilferable items as possible and store them in a secure location.    AFI34-202  22 DECEMBER 2015 61  9.4.  Contingency  Operations.  Contingency  operations  will  follow  all  applicable  AF  NAF guidelines  for  protection  of  NAFs.    In  addition,  contingency  operations  will  work  with  the assigned supporting location to ensure all requirements are met.  GINA M.
