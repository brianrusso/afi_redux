Organization  and  Role.  NOTE:  For  the  purpose  of  this  handbook,  all  references  to battlespace  refer  to  the  Base  Security  Zone  (BSZ)  and  areas  within  the  BSZ.  Additionally,  the terms “information” and “data” are used interchangeably within this document. 1.1.1.  In  accordance  with  AFPD  31-1,  Integrated  Defense,  “It is  an  Installation Commander’s  inherent  responsibility  to  identify  risks  and  develop  risk  management strategies to produce effects-based, integrated defense plans to ensure unhindered Air Force, Joint  and Coalition missions.”  ID incorporates multidisciplinary  active  and passive, offense and defense capabilities, employed to mitigate potential risks and defeat adversary threats to Air Force operations. Per AFI 31-101 one of the key tasks of creating flexible, responsive ID operations  within  varying  threat  environments  is  to  operationalize  force  protection intelligence  (FPI).  This  can  be  accomplished  for  the  Defense  Force  Commander  (DFC) through  the  development  of  a  robust  intelligence/information  collaboration,  analysis  and fusion capability. 1.1.1.1.  It  is  important  to  note  DODD  5200.27,  Acquisition  of  Information  Concerning Persons  and  Organizations  Not  Affiliated  with  the  Department  of  Defense,  prescribes how  DoD  Criminal  Intelligence  (CRIMINT)  collection,  maintenance,  use,  and dissemination  of  personally  identifiable  information  and  law  enforcement  information will occur. Additionally, in accordance with DoDD 5200.27 the gathering of CRIMINT and  predictive  intelligence  (PI)  regarding  persons  without  a  connection  to  DoD  or reasonable  expectation  of  threat  or  direction  of  interest  toward  DoD  personnel  or facilities  is  prohibited.  Additional  policies  and  guidance  regarding  DoD  CRIMINT activities  are  outlined  in  DoDI  5525.18,  Law  Enforcement  Criminal  Intelligence (CRIMINT) in DoD. 1.1.1.2.  Further,  due  diligence  should  be  given  to  intelligence  oversight  issues  when carrying  out  the  FPI  process.  The  duties  and  obligations  placed  on  DOD  intelligence organizations  to  protect  the  rights  of  individuals  stem  from  the  U.S.  Constitution, Presidential  Executive  Order  12333,  and  DOD  Regulation  5240.1-R,  Procedures Governing  the  Activities  of  DOD  Intelligence  Components  that  Affect  United  States Persons,  which  spells  out  how  the  Presidential  Executive  Order  applies  to  Defense intelligence activities. 1.1.2.  The  Security  Forces  S2  is  responsible  for  coordinating  with  Air  Force  Office  of Special  Investigation  (AFOSI)  and  the  appropriate  level  intelligence  FPI  representative  to facilitate Threat Information Integration. The goal of this coordination is to provide the DFC the information required to conduct ID operations. 1.1.2.1.  The  S2  contributes  law  enforcement  data  within  Security  Forces  purview,  to include data in the Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) and from debriefings of security/law enforcement patrols within the installation’s Area of  Interest (AOI). 1.1.2.2.  AFOSI  is  responsible  for  contributing  information/intelligence  derived  from independent  criminal  investigations,  counterintelligence  activities,  and  specialized   4  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 investigative  and  force  protection  support  as  well  as  information  gleaned  from  liaison with  federal,  state,  local  and  foreign  nation  law  enforcement,  counterintelligence  and security agencies. Per AFI 71-101, Volume 1, Criminal Investigations Program, AFOSI is  the  AF  interface  between  the  JTTFs,  FBI  and  local  law  enforcement  for  suspicious activity reporting. 1.1.2.3.  The FPI representative is responsible for coordination of force protection-related products  (i.e.  daily  intelligence  summaries,  terrorist  handbooks,  threat  documents  and briefings,  etc.)  and  services  with  AFOSI  to  de-conflict  responsibilities  and  ensure  S2 requirements  are  satisfied.  The  FPI  representative  is  also  responsible  for  providing Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB).  The S2 will use information generated by the TII process to keep the DFC (and through the DFC, the Installation Commander) aware of the circumstances, patterns, trends, or incidents regarding criminal intelligence related to SF operations. 1.1.3.  The DFC is the approval authority for all products generated by the S2 released within the security forces squadron. Material produced collaboratively by the TII or expected to be released  outside  of  security  forces  should  be  coordinated  with  all  TII  functional  areas  (i.e., DFC,  AFOSI  Detachment  Commander  (DetCo),  Senior  Intelligence  Officer)  prior  to dissemination  outside  their  agencies  or  their  respective  chains  of  command.  Products generated by the collaborative agencies and the S2 are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. 1.2.  Training.  To  provide  effective  situational  awareness  to  the  DFC,  the  S2  must  be  able  to contextualize  all-source  information  for  the  purpose  of  supporting  ID  operations.  This  requires skills  similar  to  many  civilian  law  enforcement  criminal  intelligence  analysis  functions.  This type of training is  readily  available through multiple venues and it is  the responsibility of each DFC to assess the skill level of their S2 personnel. The DFC is also responsible for determining which type of training would best suit the S2. DoDI 5525.18 requires analysis of CRIMINT to be accomplished by analysts that possess professional training and practical experiences consistent with  the  professional  standards  articulated  by  the  International  Association  of  LE  Intelligence Analysts.  Other  courses  may  take  an  IC  approach  and  train  in  accordance  with  Intelligence Community  Directive  (ICD)  203,  Analytic  Standards.  Regardless  of  which  venue,  the  goal  of this training is to facilitate more effective communication between TII contributors by teaching the S2 how analysts perform their mission and allow the S2 to “speak the same language” as OSI and intelligence representatives rather than turn the S2 into an intelligence analyst. Additionally, this type of training will teach the S2 what their agencies bring to the fight which will help them better shape their requests for information when needed. The following are venues where these skills can be acquired. 1.2.1.  The Air Mobility Command’s Force Protection Intelligence Formal Training Unit (FP IFTU)  course.  This  course  provides  basic  FPI  skills  necessary  to  conduct  intelligence preparation  of  the  operating  environment  (IPOE)  and  intelligence  preparation  of  the battlefield (IPB) as well as an introduction to the intelligence community (IC) and the basics of analytical tools and processes. 1.2.2.  Another  venue  is  the  Army  Intelligence  Analyst  Course.  Additionally,  S2s  should consider  pursuing  courses  taught  or  administered  by/through  Army  Knowledge  Online (AKO), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   5  Defense  Security  Service  (DSS),  and Environment (AGILE)(https://www.agile.mil). the  Advanced  Global  Intelligence  Learning 1.2.3.  Certification is not required to perform S2 duties within the Security Forces purview. Certification  through  national-level  agencies  can,  however,  enhance  relationships  through establishing credibility recognized across the Criminal  Intelligence Analysis enterprise. The Foundations  of  Intelligence  Analysis  Training  Program  taught  through  the  Association  of Law Enforcement Intelligence Units and the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C) is widely  used  and  can  greatly  contribute  toward  establishing  the  communication  skills necessary for the S2. 1.2.4.  Many  low-cost  or  no-cost  training  options  are  available.  These  options  should  be considered and exploited to the greatest extent possible. Training can be requested/conducted through  organic  installation  training  venues  per  AFI  14-119,  Intelligence  Support  to  Force Protection. 1.2.4.1.  Awareness. The broadest, most diverse types of intelligence training could best be described as “awareness” training. These programs, which vary in length from 2 hours to  4  days,  tend  to  include  information  about  the intelligence  discipline  (i.e.,  definitions, methods,  processes,  etc.)  as  integrated  with  a  specific  subject  matter  (e.g.,  drugs, terrorism,  auto  theft).  The  Bureau  of  Justice  Assistance  State  and  Local  Antiterrorism Training  (SLATT),  Federal  Law  Enforcement  Training  Center  (FLETC),  and  other groups offer this training throughout the country. 1.2.4.2.  Intelligence  Analyst.  Intelligence  analysts  training  programs  have  a  reasonable degree of consistency in the subject matter topics; however, the hours of training on each topic  have  more  variance.  In  some  cases,  the  curricula  include  substantive  modules  on subject matter. For example, the FBI Center for Intelligence Training program integrates intelligence  methods  specifically  with  crimes  within  FBI  jurisdiction.  Similarly,  DEA curricula integrates intelligence methods with material on drug trafficking. 1.2.4.3.  Specialized  Training.  This  training  focuses  on  a  narrow  aspect  of  the  entire intelligence  process  and/or  specific  tools  available  to  intelligence  analysts.  Courses  that fall  into  this  category  are  generally  software  courses  such  as  classes  on  how  to  use  a particular type of intelligence software (typically either analytic software or databases). 1.3.  Equipment. 1.3.1.  In order to effectively perform their duties in support of the  Integrated Defense Risk Management  Process  (IDRMP),  the  S2  should,  at  a  minimum,  be  provided  the  following equipment/resources: 1.3.1.1.  Computer workstation with Non-classified Internet Protocol Network (NIPRNet) and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) connectivity. 1.3.1.2.  Microsoft  Office®  for  word-processing,  document  publication,  and  spreadsheet support. 1.3.1.3.  Adobe Pro® for product development and protection. 1.3.1.4.  Access  to  authoritative  databases  and  systems  such  as  eGuardian  (Law Enforcement  Online  (LEO)),  State/National  Crime  Information  Center  systems  (NCIC),   6  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 Regional  Information  Sharing  Systems  (RISS),  and  the  Homeland  Security  Information Network. 1.3.1.5.  Google Earth Client® 1.3.1.6.  Tools  for  data  consolidation  and/or  collaboration  (e.g.,  analysis  software  (as necessary), i2 COPLINK®). AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   7  Chapter 2 THREAT INFORMATION INTEGRATION OVERVIEW 2.1.  Information  Sharing.  The  need  to  develop  and  share  information  has  significantly changed  in  recent threat  mitigation  is  contingent  upon  the  ability  to  gather,  evaluate  and  share  information  and intelligence  regarding  those  who  intend  to  attack  Air  Force  assets;  the  tactics,  techniques,  and procedures they use; and the targets they intend to select. Information sharing procedures ensure data and analysis are placed in the hands of the appropriate entities in a timely manner. Whether the aggressor is a trained operative from an international terrorist organization, a self-radicalized lone offender, or a disgruntled individual, risk mitigation is contingent upon an environment that facilitates  the  continual  and  rapid  exchange  of  information.  Information  sharing  also  fosters  an environment  in  which  individuals  possess  a  common  baseline  of  familiarity  with  threat information.  That  framework  permits  faster  identification  and  contextualization  of  new  or changing  threats,  minimizing  the  time  it  takes  to  start  mitigation  procedures  for  legitimate concerns,  and  decreasing  time  wasted  on  items  of  negligible  concern.  The  following  sections contextualize  the  information  sharing  environment  and  provide  the  foundation  for  information sharing at the installation level. 2.1.1.  Guiding  Principles  for  Information  Sharing.  Entities  responsible  for  combating  and responding to malevolent threats along the threat continuum must have access to timely and accurate  information  regarding  potential  threat  actors.  That  information  guides  combined efforts to: 2.1.1.1.  Identify immediate and long-term threats. 2.1.1.2.  Identify persons and/or groups involved in threat-related activities. 2.1.1.3.  Identify tactics and capabilities of known persons and/or groups. 2.1.1.4.  Identify potential targets. 2.1.1.5.  Facilitate efforts to conduct Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB). 2.1.1.6.  Implement  information-driven  and  risk-based  detection,  prevention,  deterrence, response, protection, and emergency management efforts that yield effects which support mission assurance. 2.1.2.  Information  Sources.  Criminal  and  terrorism-related  intelligence  is  best  derived  by collecting,  blending,  analyzing,  and  evaluating  relevant  information  from  a  broad  array  of sources on a continual basis. There is no single source for threat-related information.  It can materialize  through  the  efforts  of  the  intelligence  community,  law  enforcement  authorities (both military and civilian), other government agencies, public and private sector sources, as well as open sources. 2.1.2.1.  Since  the  events  of  September  11,  2001,  the  focus  of  information  sharing  has pertained  to  terrorism;  however,  the  need  for  collaboration  extends  beyond  terrorism-related issues to encompass all aspects of Force Protection Information as defined in AFI 14-119,  Intelligence  Support  to  Force  Protection.  Force  Protection  is  defined  in  Joint Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, as   8  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 preventive measures taken to mitigate hostile actions against DoD personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information. 2.1.2.2.  Information does not typically come neatly packaged and labeled to indicate its subject matter or domain of interest. Information from one domain may prove valuable in another, often at a different time and in another form. 2.1.3.  Information  Sharing  Foundations.  The  following  core  principles  and  understandings, adopted  from  the  National  Strategy  for  Information  Sharing:    Successes  and  Challenges  in Improving  Terrorism  Related  Information  Sharing  (2007),  serve  as  a  foundation  for implementing an effective information sharing program: 2.1.3.1.  Strong  Partnerships.  Effective  information  sharing  comes  through  strong partnerships  among  key  principals  and  stakeholders  (e.g.,  AFOSI,  Security  Forces, Intelligence,  Operations,  Emergency  Management,  etc.).  Strong  partnerships  build investments  in  cross-organizational  interaction  that  outlast  mission  stressors  and personnel turnover. 2.1.3.2.  Collaboration.  To  maximize  information  sharing,  key  principals/stakeholders must communicate and collaborate. The objective is to leverage resources and expertise while improving the ability to detect and prevent threat activity. Fostering a collaborative environment  builds  trust  among  participating  entities,  strengthens  partnerships,  and creates  individual  and  collective  ownership  in  the  overall  force  protection  mission.  The purpose of collaboration is to increase capacity, communication and continuity of service while decreasing duplication. Collaboration also provides key principals access to bodies of information not normally accessible within their purview, permitting a comprehensive view  of  threat  data.  All  units  on  an  installation  support  the  installation  commander. Ultimately, the  goal  of information integration is to  provide the installation commander the information needed to protect his/her installation, resources, and personnel. 2.1.3.3.  Functional Awareness. Information acquired for one purpose, or under one set of authorities, might provide unique insights when combined, in accordance with applicable law,  to  information  from  other  sources.  Successful  information  sharing  relationships endure because key principals are aware of the requirements and challenges, background and worldview of all other members. 2.1.3.4.  Information Sharing Culture. Information sharing must be woven into all aspects of  TII,  including  preventive  and  protective  actions,  actionable  responses,  criminal  and counterterrorism  investigative  activities,  incident  preparedness,  and  response  to  and recovery from catastrophic incidents. 2.1.3.4.1.  Interconnectivity.  Key  force  protection  principals  must  communicate effectively. The ultimate goal is to  eliminate barriers to communications, close gaps in  mission  essential  information  cross  flow,  and  develop  and  exchange  information vital to protecting installation personnel and resources. 2.1.3.4.2.  Multidisciplinary  Awareness  and  Education.  All  personnel  should  be trained  to  identify  suspicious  activities  or  threats  and  provide  information  to appropriate  personnel.  Specific  training  should  pertain  to  the  identification  and reporting  of  suspicious  anomalies  or  behavioral  indicators  that  may  be  indicative  of potential criminal or terrorist activity. AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   9  2.1.3.4.3.  Reporting  Mechanisms.  Personnel  must  be  familiar  with  local  reporting requirements  and  have  the  ability  to  utilize  the  variety  of  different  resources  to exchange  information.  Reporting  mechanisms  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  911 systems,  installation  Eagle  Eyes  program,  Crime  Stop  lines,  eGuardian,  and  routine numbers  for  on-  and  off-installation  law  enforcement  agencies.  Intelligence community  reports  include  SITREPS,  Spot  Reports  and  a  host  of  different  vehicles pertaining  to  diverse  domestic  and  global  developments  or  impending  incidents. These reporting mechanisms provide the preponderance of tactical-level information that ultimately form the foundation for risk mitigation planning efforts. 2.1.3.5.  Intelligent  Integration  and  Mutual  Respect.  The  procedures,  processes  and systems that support information sharing must draw upon and integrate existing technical capabilities and must respect established functional authorities and responsibilities. 2.1.3.5.1.  To  the  greatest  extent  possible,  agencies  participating  in  information sharing  endeavors  should initiatives. Leveraging the databases and systems already available via participating entities will help maximize information sharing and eliminate redundancy. information  sharing leverage  existing 2.1.3.5.2.  The  core  contributors  of  the  TII  process  should  be  comprised  of  SFS/S2, AFOSI,  and  appropriate  level  FPI  representatives.  Additional  members,  such  as medical  intelligence,  civil  engineers,  etc.  may  be  added  at  the  Installation Commander’s direction. 2.1.3.5.2.1.  It  is  important  to  note that no single  functional  area owns the threat information  integration  process.  The  process,  as  well  as  the  members  present, support the installation commander. 2.1.3.5.2.2.  At its core, threat information integration is simply sharing data with other functional areas with the overall goal of increasing the analytic capability of installations  to  identify  and  process  what  is  known  and  unknown  regarding threats.  The  TII  functional  areas  must  work  together  to  achieve  a  systematic, mutually-supportive,  and  collaborative  information-sharing  environment  that serves  the  information  needs  of  all  force  protection  entities  on  the  installation. Each TII collaborator represents a conduit of information and/or intelligence from his  or  her  agency  that  can  infuse  agency-specific  information  into  the  collective body of information for analysis. While TII is designed to be a collaborative effort between  intelligence  and  information  hubs,  Operational  Control  (OPCON), Tactical  Control  (TACON)  and  Administrative  Control  (ADCON)  of  the contributing  members  remain  with  the  owning  commander  of  each  of  these functional areas. 2.1.3.5.3.  Clearly  defining  the  TII  roles  of  participating  agencies  in  the  Integrated Defense  Plan  (IDP)  is  necessary  to  define  the  terms,  responsibilities,  relationships, intentions,  and  commitments  of  each  participating  entity.  The  IDP  should  also provide  an  outline  of  the  “who,  what,  where,  when,  why,  and  how”  of  TII. Participating  agencies  will  become  greater  stakeholders  to  the  process  and  be  more inclined  to  hold  to  the  policies  defined  within  this  installation  plan.  Information sharing can be, and often is, facilitated in a virtual environment.   10  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 2.1.3.6.  Outreach  and  Partnerships.  Higher  Headquarters  (e.g.,  MAJCOM,  NAF) information sharing organizations and agencies represent a valuable information sharing resource  and  should  be  incorporated  into  information  sharing  frameworks  as  much  as possible.  Official  liaison  relationships  should  be  established  at  the  appropriate  levels  in accordance with existing policy. 2.2.  Information  Integration.  The  concept  of  information  integration  has  emerged  as  the fundamental  process  to  facilitate  the  sharing  of  threat  information.  The  ultimate  goal  of integration from the perspective of the S2 is to ensure that intelligence and/or information shared under  the  guidelines  above  is  of  the  best  possible  quality  and  enables  Integrated  Defense  (ID) forces  to  achieve  the  desired  effect  of  Anticipation.  For  the  purpose  of  this  guide,  integration refers  to  the  overarching  process  of    assimilating  information  and/or  intelligence  from contributing agencies identified by the installation commander to achieve the desired FP effects of  detect,  deter,  preempt,  negate,  and  mitigate. It  goes  beyond  establishing  an information/intelligence  center  or  creating  a  computer  network.  TII  members  need  to minimize/delete  redundancy  by  being  knowledgeable  and  respecting  each  agency’s  primary role(s)  in  TII  and  avoiding  overlap.  The  information  integration  process  supports  the  planning and implementation of the IDRMP as outlined in AFI 31-101. 2.2.1.  Data  integration  is  the  process  of  gathering  and  evaluating  information  from  all available sources and intelligence disciplines to derive as complete an assessment as possible of  detected  enemy,  hostile  or  potentially  hostile  activity.  It  draws  on  the  complementary strengths  of  all  intelligence  disciplines,  and  relies  on  an  all-source  approach  to  intelligence collection and analysis. Data integration is an on-going process involving the delineation of roles and responsibilities; creating requirements; and collecting, integrating, evaluating, and disseminating critical information-not all of which tasks are conducted by S2 personnel. 2.2.1.1.  Data  integration  also  involves  the  exchange  of  information  from  different sources  including  law  enforcement,  public  safety,  and  the  private  sector,  with  analysis and synthesis resulting in meaningful and credible intelligence while adhering to existing policy  and  law.  Integration  also  allows  for  continual  reevaluation  of  existing  data  in context  with  new  data  in  order  to  provide  constant  updates  and  more  comprehensive situational awareness of the local operating environment. 2.2.1.2.  Data  integration  relies  on  collection  and  analysis  efforts  that  optimize  the strengths of the different sources. Information is sought from the widest possible range of sources to  avoid  any bias that can result from  relying on a single source  of information and  to  improve  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  intelligence.  The  collection  of information  from  multiple  sources  is  essential  to  countering  the  adversary’s  operations security and deception operations. 2.3.  Threat Information Integration.  The purpose of the functional communities participating in  threat  information  integration  is  to  proactively  seek  out,  evaluate  and  share  information  in order  to  identify  threats  to  the  installation  and  its  resources.  The  role  of  the  SF/S2  in  TII  is  to liaise  with  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs)  from  AFOSI  and  intelligence  communities  to  ensure the  most  complete  and  credible  threat  picture  is  provided  to  the  installation  commander.  A primary  focus  of  TII  is  the  intelligence  and  information  integration  process,  through  which information  is  collected,  evaluated,  and  disseminated.  Nontraditional  providers  of  this  type  of information, such as Security Forces, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, the general population, and AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   11  private  sector  organizations,  possess  important  information  (e.g.,  crimestop  and  suspicious activity  reports)  that  can  be  “integrated”  with  other  data,  IAW  established  policy  and  law,  to provide  meaningful  information  and  intelligence  about  potential  terrorist  threats  and  criminal activity in a timely manner. 2.3.1.  Interagency  intelligence  collaboration  should  be  encouraged  whenever  possible consistent with applicable National, Joint, Departmental, and USAF policy, or organizational procedures  and  classification  guidelines.  Successful  interagency  intelligence  collaboration depends upon many factors, to include: strong relationship networks, trust and respect among colleagues,  sharing  a  common  vision,  minimizing issues,  continuous communication, and commitment from the leadership of collaborating organizations. Liaison personnel  are  instrumental  in  bridging  gaps  and  working  through  barriers  that  may  arise between organizations. An aggressive liaison effort is critical to developing and maintaining unity  of  effort  from  initial  planning  through  execution.  However,  analysts  must  base  their collaboration  on  classification,  need-to-know,  need-to-share,  applicable  law,  and  national, DoD, service, agency or organizational guidelines. Regardless of the basis for collaboration, all TII is conducted IAW Intelligence Oversight rules. territorial 2.3.2.  The following principles for interagency information/intelligence collaboration should be adhered to during TII: 2.3.2.1.  Establish  Strong  Relationship  Networks.  Collaboration  is  built  upon  the relationships  and  networks  of  colleagues  developed  throughout  their  careers.  Without knowledge  of  who  one’s  subject  matter  experts  are  in  intelligence  organizations, collaboration  on  assessing  the  threat  is  nearly  impossible.  Techniques  for  building relationship  networks  include  attending  or  hosting  conferences,  visiting  counterparts  in other  organizations  and  exchanges  of  personnel  through  inter-organizational  rotational assignments. 2.3.2.2.  Build  Mutual  Trust  and  Respect  among  Colleagues.  As  evaluators  work intelligence  problems,  they  count  on  one  another  to  share  all  relevant  data  from  within their  particular  field  of  expertise.  Trust  and  respect  is  facilitated  by  proactively communicating  information  to  colleagues  and  counterparts  and  by  ensuring  they  are recognized by their organizations for their expertise and contributions. 2.3.2.3.  Share  a  Common  Vision.  This  shared  common  vision  starts  with  the commander’s intent.  A shared common vision should include the goal of providing the most comprehensive, accurate Local Threat Assessment (LTA) possible to the customer (i.e., Installation Commander and functional chains of command). It should be noted that AFOSI  also  produces  an  annual  Criminal  Threat  Assessment  (CTA)  that  is  provided  to the  Installation  Commander  and  the  Security  Forces.  The  combination  of  both assessments  should  provide  the  necessary  awareness  to  execute  FP  activities.  Sharing  a common  goal  among  collaborators  is  facilitated  by  taking  the  initiative  to  alert  others when  new  information  becomes  available,  working  together  instead  of  competing  and tipping off the target of information/intelligence collection. By synchronizing efforts, the strengths of each community can be maximized for the benefit of all collaborators. 2.3.2.4.  Minimize  Territorial  Issues.  Reducing  the  potential  for  inter-organizational conflicts is vital to successful intelligence collaboration. It is important an S2 embarking on a collaborative effort recognize that turf issues are likely to  occur and should not  be   12  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 ignored.  These  issues  may  be  minimized  by  anticipating  their  occurrence,  developing  a plan for addressing them as they emerge and stressing the mutually beneficial aspects of collaboration  such  as  sharing  organizational  credit  for  the  final  product(s).  AF participants  in  threat  information  integration  should  have  a  clear  understanding  of standing  installation  FP  information/intelligence  requirements,  the  capabilities  and limitations  of  their  respective  organization’s  mission  as  it  relates  to  intelligence, counterintelligence,  threat  collections,  investigations  and  law  enforcement  liaison.  A clear understanding of these lanes in the road will help to minimize territorial issues. 2.3.2.5.  Encourage Continuous Communication. Continuous communication among data sharing  colleagues  and  counterparts  is  critical  to  overcoming  barriers  to  collaboration. Communication  may  be  enhanced  through  frequent  meetings,  teleconferences,  phone calls,  e-mail,  and  other  sources  of  dialogue,  as  well  as  less  formal  methods  such  as periodic working lunches. AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   13  Chapter 3 OPERATIONAL PROCESSES 3.1.  Scope of Effort. 3.1.1.  The focus of the S2 is to enhance effects-based security operations at the installation level by conscientiously  and continuously monitoring current and developing threats within the BSZ and the AOI, maintaining ever vigilant situational awareness, and providing accurate and timely assessments to Security Forces decision makers with the goal of achieving the ID effect of Anticipation. 3.1.2.  Information  requirements  are  primarily  based  upon  the  installation  LTA  and  CTA. Additionally,  reports,  assessments,  observations,  and  tactical-level  information  (e.g.,  field interviews, patrol reports, etc.) collected locally will be considered and/or utilized to ensure the  S2  has  both  a  “macro”  and  “micro”  view  of  the  potential  threat  environment.  This continuous integration of information  from multiple levels  will assist  the S2 in  maintaining situational  awareness  of  threats  to  the  installation.  The  S2  must  guard  against  simply forwarding information; intelligence and data obtained from other sources must be evaluated for pertinence and forwarded as appropriate. 3.1.2.1.  Information  and  Intelligence  Requirements.  S2s  should  leverage  installation Threat  Working  Groups  (TWG)  that  are  required  to  develop  and  refine  terrorism  threat assessments.  TWGs  should  develop  a  threat  matrix  from  the  analysis  of  the  LTA.  If properly completed, the threat matrix will identify the Design Basis Threat (DBT) for all identified threats. If gaps in information exist, the TII process should be leveraged to fill threat  information  gaps  to  meet  the  Installation  Commander’s  Critical  Information Requirements (CCIR) in order to  facilitate the COA development process. The S2 must know  where  to  submit  requests  for  information  in  order  to  close  remaining  information gaps. For this very reason it is imperative that the S2 be an integral part of ID planning and  risk  analysis  processes.  If,  during  ID  planning,  it  is  determined  that  insufficient information  is  available  to  make  an  informed  decision  (i.e.,  during  enemy  course  of action (COA) or friendly COA development), the S2 should identify the information gap and initiate contact  with (or through) AFOSI, local law enforcement agencies (IAW the AFOSI and SF investigative matrix) and/or the FPI representative, as applicable, to gain additional  information  in  order  to  better  formulate  recommendations  for  risk  decision-makers.  Every  effort  should  be  made  to  seek  out  already  published  products  and assessments that may fill information gaps prior to initiating a Requests for Information (RFIs) to meet Commander Critical Information Requirements (CCIR), based on unfilled Priority Intelligence Requirement (PIR) and/or Friendly Forces Information Requirement (FFIR). 3.1.2.2.  If, after exhausting all other means and methods, information gaps still exist, the S2 should submit an RFI (See Attachment 2) to the appropriate agency, normally through the AFOSI or FPI representative. Good RFIs have three things in common: they ask only one  question  (e.g.,  inquire  about  enemy  status  or  action);  they  focus  on  a  specific  fact, incident,  or  activity;  and  they  provide  the  intelligence  required  to  support  a  single decision  (e.g.,  if  the  enemy  does  this,  then  I  have  to  decide  what  to  do). AFOSI  and/or   14  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 FPI  representatives  can  assist  the  S2  in  drafting  the  RFI  by  focusing  on  the  correct questions to ask. 3.2.  Data Integration Process.  The TII process leverages all-source intelligence to identify and evaluate  threats  that  may  affect  installation  personnel,  assets,  infrastructure,  information  and resources.  This  includes  threats  to  the  installation  from  foreign  actors,  domestic  terrorists, sophisticated  and  unsophisticated  criminals,  vandals,  protestors,  narcotics  trafficking,  or  hate groups; suspicious or possible pre-operational activity reporting; and correlation with incidents, intelligence, and law enforcement products related to the protection of installation resources. 3.2.1.  Step  1  –  Identify  the  incident.  The  first  step  in  this  process  is  initiated  when  an incident occurs or information is received that either directly affects the installation or is of such  significance  it  must  be  monitored  for  aggressor  tactic,  technique,  or  procedure  (TTP) value  and/or  situational  awareness.  A  TWG  may  be  convened  and  leverage  TII  to  gather information  about  the  incident  from  a  variety  of  sources  to  include  open  source  media reporting;  however,  the  most  likely  (and  preferred)  sources  will  be  information-sharing networks like the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) or LEO. 3.2.2.  Step 2 – Threat Categorization. The second step is to evaluate the information that has been  received  and  determine  the  threat  posed  to  installation  assets.  The  S2  shares  this information  with  other  TII  stakeholders  and  the  S2’s  chain  of  command  IAW  established policy and law. Subsequently, the threat posed is categorized by the Installation Commander. Classification will determine subsequent TII actions and fall into one of three categories: 3.2.2.1.  Threat: If the S2 believes the data reveals a threat to the installation or its assets, the  S2  will  immediately  report  this  information  to  the  DFC.  This  may  initiate  a  Threat Working  Group  (TWG)  and  S2  and  other  TII  participants  should  attempt  to  develop  as much information as possible about the threat. 3.2.2.2.  Unknown:  If  the  nature  of  the  information  and  its  potential  threat  is  unknown, the  S2  will  continue  to  monitor/evaluate  and  seek  further  information  until  termination. The  S2  should  utilize  their  best  judgment  or  a  pre-coordinated  notification  matrix  to determine  whether  this  situation  warrants  immediate  notification  to  their  chain  of command. 3.2.2.3.  No Threat:  If the information  does not  represent  a threat  to  the installation, the S2 will continue to monitor the situation for potential TTP identification and situational awareness. 3.2.3.  Step  3  –  Information  Evaluation.  In  the  third  step,  the  S2  evaluates  data  through  a structured  process  to  determine  its  value  and  relevance.  During  this  processing/exploitation step,  the  S2  sifts  out  the  useless,  non-relevant  and/or  incorrect  information  and  then arranges/evaluates  the  remaining  information  to  establish  relationships  between  seemingly disparate data. The process is designed to scrutinize the source, quality, and legitimacy of the information prior to the analytical phase and consists of three primary decision points. 3.2.3.1.  Determination  of  relevance  to  the  installation.  Some  questions  to  consider include: 3.2.3.1.1.  Is the information meaningful to the installation? AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   15  3.2.3.1.2.  Does the information have merit? (Both on its own or when combined with other information.) 3.2.3.2.  Determination of information  reliability  based on confidence levels reflected in the source document. Some questions to consider include: 3.2.3.3.  Determination  of information  plausibility/validity.  Consider  key  source information  used  in  the  product,  addressing  factors  such  as  potential  strengths  and limitations  of  available  information,  notable  inconsistencies  in  reporting,  important information gaps, or other factors that the producing organization deems relevant. 3.2.3.4.  Source reliability and information validity are assessed using the ordinal scale in Figure  3.1.  This  method,  although  not  foolproof,  serves  as  the  baseline  procedure  for assigning  a  level  of  credibility  to  the  information  received  by  the  TII  contributors.  It  is important to note that this system is not perfect. A credible source can provide erroneous information  and  a  non-credible  source  can  provide  valid  information.  The  credibility  of the  source  and  the  validity  of  the  information  should  be  assessed  individually.  NOTE: This  information  is  for  informational  purposes  only  as  the  S2  will  not  usually  be  in  a position to determine the reliability or validity of a source. Figure 3.1.  Source Reliability/Information Validity Matrix. 3.2.4.  Step 4 – Analysis: Turning Information into Intelligence (Analysis/Production).  3.2.4.1.  The  end  goal  of  TII  is  the  collection,  assessment  and  analysis  of  threat information  relating  to  installation  personnel  and  resources  and  the  subsequent dissemination of information that is actionable to installation leadership. Analysis is the fundamental process where raw data is processed using a scientific approach to problem solving,  logical  reasoning,  and  the  objective  interpretation  of  data.  Analysis  establishes connections between the different data, cause and effect, and correlations of activities and behaviors. The new knowledge derived from analysis can provide insights into imminent and emerging threats, as well as potential interdiction methods. TII contributors should: 3.2.4.1.1.  Blend data, information, and intelligence received from multiple sources.   16  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 3.2.4.1.2.  Reconcile, de-conflict, and validate the credibility of data, information, and intelligence received from collection sources. 3.2.4.1.3.  Evaluate and examine data and information using SMEs. 3.2.4.1.4.  Identify and prioritize the risks facing the installation and tenant units. 3.2.4.1.5.  Produce  value-added the development of performance-driven, risk-based prevention, response, and emergency management programs. intelligence  products that  can  support 3.2.4.1.6.  Coordinate  specific  protective  measures  to  identify  and  disrupt  potential terrorist attacks during the planning and early operational stages. 3.2.4.2.  Analytic Standards. The process used by TII contributors should meet applicable IC  and/or  LE  analytical  standards  (articulated  by  the  International  Association  of  LE Intelligence Analysts).  The following standards are listed in ICD 203: 3.2.4.2.1.  Objectivity. S2s need to be able to perform their analytic and informational functions from an unbiased perspective. Analysis should be free of emotional content, give due regard to  alternative perspectives  and contrary reporting, and acknowledge developments that necessitate adjustment to analytic judgments. 3.2.4.2.2.  Independent of Political Consideration. S2s provide objective assessments informed by available information that are not distorted or altered with the intent of supporting or advocating a particular policy, political viewpoint, or audience. 3.2.4.2.3.  Timeliness. S2s will strive to deliver their products in time for them to be actionable by customers. 3.2.4.2.4.  Based  upon  all  available  sources  of  data/intelligence.  The  S2’s  analysis will  be  based  upon  all  available  relevant  information.  Where  critical  gaps  exist,  the S2  will  work  with  collectors  (AFOSI  and  FPI)  to  develop  appropriate  collection, dissemination, and access strategies. 3.2.4.2.5.  Exhibits Proper Standard of Analytic Tradecraft, specifically: 3.2.4.2.5.1.  Properly  describes quality  and  reliability of underlying sources. The S2’s  products  will  accurately  characterize  the  information  in  the  underlying sources  and  explain  which  information  proved  key  to  analytic  judgments  and why. 3.2.4.2.5.2.  Properly caveats and expresses uncertainties or confidence in analytic judgments.  S2  products  should  indicate  both  the  level  of  confidence  in  analytic judgment and explain the basis for ascribing it. Sources of uncertainty, including information gaps and significant contrary reporting, are noted and linked logically and consistently to confidence levels in judgments. As appropriate, products will also  identify  indicators  that  would  enhance  or  reduce  confidence  or  prompt revision or existing judgments. 3.2.4.2.5.3.  Properly distinguishes between underlying intelligence and analysts’ assumptions  and the  critical assumptions  upon  which  analysis  is  based  and  explain  the  implications  for judgments if those assumptions are incorrect. As appropriate, analytical products judgments.  S2  products  explicitly identify AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   17  should identify indicators that would signal whether assumptions or judgments are more or less likely to be correct. 3.2.4.2.5.4.  Incorporates  alternative  analysis  where  appropriate.  S2  products identify  and  explain  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  alternative  hypotheses, viewpoints,  or  outcomes  in  light  of  both  available  information  and  information gaps. 3.2.4.2.5.5.  Demonstrates relevance to US national security. S2 products provide information  and  insight  on  issues  relevant  to  the  products’  intended  consumers and/or provide useful context, warning, or opportunity analysis. 3.2.4.2.5.6.  Uses  logical  argumentation.  S2  analytical  presentations  should facilitate  clear  understanding  of  the  information  and  reasoning  underlying analytical judgments. 3.2.4.2.5.7.  Exhibits  consistency of analysis over time, or highlights  change and explains rationale. S2 analytic products should deliver a key message that is either consistent with previous production on the topic from the same analytic element or, if the key analytic message has changed, highlights the change and explains its rationale and implications. 3.2.4.2.5.8.  Makes  accurate  judgments  and  assessments.  Analytic  elements should  apply  expertise  and  logic  to  make  the  most  accurate  judgments  and assessments possible given the information available to the analytic element and known information gaps. 3.2.4.3.  Critical Thinking. 3.2.4.3.1.  Identify  and  clarify  the  question/situation.  Recognize  and  clearly  identify the true nature of the question/situation. In this regard, S2s will ensure that analysis is based  upon  clearly  defined  and  logical  questions.  The  questions  may  come  from outside  agencies,  or  they  may  be  analytical  starting  points  established  by  the  S2s themselves.  In  either  case,  the  intent  will  be  the  same  –  to  ensure  the question/situation is clearly understood before the analytical process is initiated. 3.2.4.3.2.  Gather  information.  Learn  more  about  the  question/situation.  Look  for possible causes and solutions. Review facts, data, evidence, or previous experiences. Reference existing analysis, bulletins, summaries, other agency products, etc. Ensure collected data supports multiple scenarios and not just the scenario one would expect (be objective). 3.2.4.3.3.  Evaluate  the  evidence.  Where  did  the  information  come  from?  Does  it represent  various points of view? What  biases could  be expected from  each source? How accurate is the information gathered? Is it fact or opinion? Can the evidence be corroborated? 3.2.4.3.4.  Consider  alternatives  and  implications.  Draw  conclusions  from  the gathered evidence and pose solutions. Weigh the particulars of each alternative. What is  the  most  likely  scenario?  Does  the  evidence  suggest  a  threat?  Is  the  scenario consistent with the threat environment?   18  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 3.2.4.3.5.  Choose  the  best  action  and  implement.  Select  an  alternative  that  is appropriate  for  the  situation  (i.e.,  discard  the  information,  notify  the  TWG,  forward the  information  for  situational  awareness,  notify  an  outside  agency,  etc.)  and  take action. 3.2.4.4.  Analytical  Tools.  A  number  of  analytic  tools  are  available  to  S2s.  “Tools” essentially  refers  to  methodological  techniques  that  help  organize,  integrate,  compare, correlate,  and  illustrate  a  body  of  raw  information.  None  of  the  tools  will  produce actionable intelligence alone; each adds a component of new knowledge – or at least new insight – about the data which, collectively, contributes to the analysis and/or leads to the definition  of  new  intelligence  requirements.  The  list  below  identifies  some  of  the  tools that should be used by the S2s in its day-to-day operations. 3.2.4.4.1.  Pattern  Analysis  (See  Attachment  3).  A  generic  term  for  a  number  of related disciplines such as crime or incident series identification, crime trend analysis, hot spot analysis and can include mapping. 3.2.4.4.2.  Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH). The S2 will explicitly identify all  the  reasonable  alternatives  for  a  particular  situation  and  have  them  “compete” against each other to determine the most plausible option. 3.2.4.4.3.  Activity  flow.  Activity  flow  shows  the  steps  a  criminal  or  terrorist enterprise  uses,  indicating  exact  incidents,  dates,  and  a  description  of  the  activities that  occurred.  The  incidents  are  linked  in  a  flow  chart  to  help  understand  the progression  of  the  enterprise.  The  activity  flow  pieces  together  a  complex organization  and  may  be  used  for  intervention  in  the  enterprise  as  well  as  to determine where gaps exist. If gaps are identified, intelligence requirements are used to  fill  the  gaps  so  that  the  activity  of  the  enterprise  can  be  fully  mapped  to  aid  in prevention and prosecution. 3.2.4.5.  An Explanation of Estimative Language. 3.2.4.5.1.  Estimative language is designed to convey judgments rather than certainty. Additionally, estimative language often conveys: 1) assessed likelihood or probability of an incident; and 2) the level of confidence ascribed to the judgment. 3.2.4.5.1.1.  Estimates  of  Likelihood.  Because  analytical  judgments  are  not certain, we use probabilistic language to reflect the S2’s estimate of the likelihood of developments or incidents. Terms such as probably, likely, very likely or almost certainly  indicate  a  greater  than  even  chance.  The  terms  unlikely  and  remote indicate a less than even chance that an incident will occur; they do not imply that an incident will not occur. Terms such as might or may reflect situations in which we are unable to  assess the likelihood, generally because relevant  information is unavailable, sketchy, or fragmented. Terms such as we cannot dismiss, we cannot rule out, or we cannot discount reflect an unlikely, improbable, or remote incident whose consequences are such that it warrants mentioning. 3.2.4.5.1.2.  Level  of  Confidence  in  Assessments.  The  S2’s  assessments  and estimates are supported by information that varies in scope, quality, and sourcing. Consequently, ascribe high, moderate, or low levels of confidence to assessments, as follows: AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   19  3.2.4.5.1.2.1.  High  confidence  generally  indicates  that  judgments  are  based upon  high-quality  information,  and/or  that  the  nature  of  the  issue  makes  it possible  to  render  a  solid  judgment.  A  “high  confidence”  judgment  is  not  a fact  or  a  certainty,  however,  and  such  judgments  still  carry  a  risk  of  being wrong. 3.2.4.5.1.2.2.  Moderate  confidence  generally  means  that  the  information  is credibly  sourced  and  plausible  but  not  of  sufficient  quality  or  corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence. Sufficient corroboration is an  analytical  judgment  that  is  dependent  upon  a  composite  of  source reliability, credibility, and number of sources. 3.2.4.5.1.2.3.  Low  confidence  generally  means information’s credibility  and/or  plausibility  is  questionable,  or  the  information  is  too fragmented  or  poorly  corroborated  to  make  solid  analytic  inferences,  or  that we have significant concerns or problems with the sources. that the 3.2.5.  Step  5  –  Dissemination/Reporting  .  The  S2  will  provide  credible  information  to  the Installation Commander  through their  respective  chain  of command when such information reflects a credible threat to installation resources. Depending upon the level of threat activity, the  Installation Commander may  convene  a TWG to  develop  and refine  threat  information, coordinate  and  disseminate  threat  warnings,  reports,  and  summaries.  Once  convened  the TWG  is  responsible  for  developing  and  recommending  appropriate  COAs  and  briefing installation  key  leadership  based  on  information  received  through  the  TII  process.  The reporting format will be determined by the criticality of the information, its time sensitivity, and the length of additional analysis required to make it most useful. No matter the format, the  overall  quality  of  the  respective  product  is  crucial  to  ensure  maximum  usability  and  to ensure credibility. 3.2.5.1.  The  characteristics  described  below  represent  the  standard  against  which  S2’s products should be continuously evaluated. 3.2.5.1.1.  Timely.  Integrated  data  must  be  available  when  the  recipient  (e.g., Installation  Commander,  DFC,  Antiterrorism  Staff,  etc.)  requires  it.  Timely intelligence/information/data  enables  the  recipient  to  anticipate  incidents  and  take proactive measures to mitigate threats. 3.2.5.1.2.  Accurate. Intelligence must be factually correct, convey an appreciation for facts and the situation as it actually exists, and provide the best possible estimate of the threat environment and possible enemy COAs based upon sound judgment of all information available. 3.2.5.1.3.  Usable. Intelligence must be tailored to the specific needs of the recipient, and must be provided in forms suitable for immediate comprehension. The recipient must  be  able  to  quickly  apply  intelligence  to  the  task  at  hand.  Providing  useful intelligence requires the producers to understand the circumstances under which their products are used. For example, commanders operate under mission, operational, and time  constraints  that  will  shape  their  intelligence  requirements  and  determine  how much  time  they  will  have  to  study  the  intelligence  they  are  provided.  Commanders may  not  have  sufficient  time  to  analyze  intelligence  reports  that  are  excessively   20  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 complex and difficult to comprehend. The “bottom line” must be up front and easily understandable. Oral presentations should be simple and to the point. 3.2.5.1.4.  Relevant.  Intelligence  must  be  relevant  to  the  mission.  It  must  aid  the recipient in the accomplishment of their respective tasks. Intelligence must contribute to the recipient’s understanding of the threat environment, but not burden them with intelligence that is of minimal or no importance to the current mission. 3.2.5.1.5.  Objective.  For  intelligence  to  be  objective,  it  should  be  unbiased, undistorted,  and  free  of  prejudicial  judgments.  The  objective  analyst  must  remain open-minded  to  all  hypotheses  and  should  never  attempt  to  make  the  facts  fit preconceptions  of  a  situation  or  an  adversary.  In  particular,  intelligence  should recognize each adversary as unique, and should avoid mirror imaging. Red teams can be  used  to  check  analytical  judgments  by  ensuring  assumptions  about  the  aggressor are valid and intelligence assessments are free from mirror imaging and cultural bias. 3.2.5.1.6.  Available.  Intelligence  must  be  readily  accessible  to  the  commander. Availability  is  a  function  of  not  only  timeliness  and  usability,  but  also  appropriate security classification, interoperability, and connectivity. Intelligence producers must strive  to  provide  data  at  the  lowest  level  of  classification  with  the  least  restrictive releasability caveats, thereby maximizing the consumers’ access, while ensuring that sources of information and methods of collection are fully protected. 3.2.5.2.  S2 authored products containing outside agency information, other than general awareness bulletins, intended for distribution outside of SF channels are coordinated with the local AFOSI and FPI representative prior to release. The most frequently used report formats are detailed below. 3.2.5.2.1.  Situational  Awareness  Bulletins/Alerts  (see  Attachment  3).  Situational awareness  bulletins/alerts  are  the  most  concise  and  frequently  used  format  and  are simply  a  concise  update  typically  forwarded  via  e-mail  regarding  a  developing situation. 3.2.5.2.1.1.  Situational  Awareness  alerts  can  be  distributed  as  directed  by  the installation  commander,  the  DFC  or  designee.  These  alerts  are  for  notification purposes  and  are  not  considered  directive  in  nature.  Specific  details  such  as sources  and  operational  security  information  will  usually  be  omitted  from  these alerts.  The  distribution  list  for  situational  awareness  notifications  will  be determined by the same authority used to direct the alert. It is advisable to share Situational  Awareness  alerts  with  other  local  DoD  installations  as  well  as local/state law enforcement agencies.  Additionally, the type of information being released  (e.g.,  For  Official  Use  Only,  Law  Enforcement  Sensitive,  etc.)  will determine  the  distribution  list.  Situational  awareness  alerts  will  be  distributed  as soon  as  possible  in  order  to  ensure  the  information  is  distributed  prior  to  the subject of the alert. 3.2.5.2.1.2.  Local  policy  and  procedures  should  be  established  that  directs whether  pre-coordination  with  key  leadership  or  peer  review  is  required, particularly  if  the  material  in  question  is  time  sensitive.  In  cases  where information  is  time  sensitive,  commanders  should  focus  on  the  need  to AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   21  disseminate information in a timely manner rather than the need to review. 3.2.5.2.2.  Incident Bulletins. Event bulletins are more comprehensive than situational awareness emails and may consist of a one- or two-page document. 3.2.5.2.2.1.  Incident  bulletins  are  distributed  due  to  threat  information  or  recent significant incidents of interest or potential impact to the installation. This kind of bulletin  will  often  be  published  following  a  physical  or  telephonic  TWG.  The bulletin  may  be  issued  in  conjunction  with  or  in  addition  to  official  force protection measure recommendations from the DFC or installation commander. 3.2.5.2.2.2.  May  include  original  assessment  or  comments  made  by  the  TII collaborators, extracts from source documents, and references with  hyperlinks or attachments. 3.2.5.2.2.3.  Distribution of incident bulletins by the S2 will be determined by the directing  authority  and  may  be  limited  based  upon  whether  or  not  direct instructions are included. 3.2.5.2.2.4.  These  alerts  will  be  distributed  as  rapidly  as  possible  allowing  for appropriate development of analytical comments. 3.2.5.2.3.  Information Bulletins. Informational summaries can be produced in various formats. The intent of the bulletin is to distill the most significant reporting available during  a  given  time  period.  The  bulletins  are  designed  to  provide  situational awareness to customers who have minimal time to devote to filtering threat reporting or  significant  intelligence  on  a  regular  basis  and  therefore  do  not  necessarily  target individuals  who  work  in  a  full  time  analytical  capacity.  Articles  in  an  information summary  may  be  sorted  by  criticality  of  the  information,  topic,  geographic  area  of interest addressed, or other headings. 3.2.5.2.3.1.  May include  brief  summaries  of  relevant  reporting,  original comments on the importance of the topic, hyperlinks to original source documents and source document, and publication date information. for include  headings these  bulletins  may 3.2.5.2.3.2.  Topics for  TTP development, suspicious activity (eGuardian reporting), and homeland or external terrorist  planning.  Note:  Per  AFI  71-101,  Volume  1,  Criminal  Investigation Program, eGuardian reporting is cleared with the installation AFOSI Detachment Commander or designee prior to dissemination. 3.2.5.2.3.3.  For  general  situational  awareness  bulletins,  widest  possible dissemination  is  encouraged;  however,  the  situation  and  classification  of  the information will dictate the distribution list. 3.2.5.2.3.4.  There is no specific time frame for these types of bulletins; however, these bulletins should be completed and distributed as soon as possible to detect or delay possible future incidents. 3.2.5.2.4.  Storyboards  (See  Attachment  5).  These  products  assist  the  S2  in establishing  a  timeline  of  incidents  and  capturing  pertinent  information  about  an incident. The incidents are captured in chronological order similar to a blotter entry.   22  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 3.2.5.2.4.1.  Following  the  description  of  the  incident,  the  S2  documents  their assessment of the incident and what possible impacts or significance the incident could have. 3.2.5.2.5.  Threat Briefings/Working Groups. 3.2.5.2.5.1.  The  S2  may  occasionally  be  asked  to  provide  topic  or  information briefs  to  specialized  gatherings  within  their  unit  such  as  guardmount  briefings, Security  Forces  Staff  Meetings,  etc  .  These  briefs  may  consist  of  general  threat information or awareness of how to contact the TII members and the support the TII  can  provide.  Threat  briefings  are  conducted  by  AFOSI  and  FPI representatives. 3.2.5.2.5.2.  May  include  formal  standup  briefings,  informal  tabletop  briefings, other  forms  of  presentation  as  required,  as  well  as  question  and  answer  periods. Formal standup briefing  slide presentations should use a  consistent slide format. Great  care  must  be  paid  to  the  highest  classification  that  can  be  discussed  in  a particular  facility  and  whether  the  audiovisual  equipment  in  the  assigned  room will support a visual presentation at that classification. 3.2.5.2.5.3.  Example  topics  may  include:  general  terrorist  threat  trends;  case studies of interest; developments in enemy attempts to bypass security measures; TII structure, capabilities, and contact information. 3.2.5.2.5.4.  Peer review and input from each TII member is highly desired. 3.3.  Ground Tasking Order Process.  Ground Tasking Orders (GTO) should be considered at the  installation  level  in  order  to  synergize  IPB  efforts  with  the  DFC’s  risk-based  security operations. While the previous sections of this document provide the framework for information-sharing,  and  the  S2’s  collaboration  within  TII,  as  well  as  the  Organizing/Training/Equipping (OT&E)  for  the  S2,  the  GTO  process  outlined  here  provides  a  framework  for  how  the  S2  can conduct daily operations in support of the DFC’s ID efforts. This process takes the outputs from previously  described  processes  and  focuses  the  scope  of  effort  towards  achieving  specific  ID effects. 3.3.1.  The  GTO  process  is  a  7-step,  7-day  continuous  cycle  that  enables  the  DFC  to  tailor forces  and  resources  according  to  the  local  threat  environment.  Figure  3.2.  depicts  this process. 3.3.1.1.  Step 1 – Information/Intelligence received from sources. This step is facilitated through normal information sharing processes outlined in paragraph 3.2. 3.3.1.2.  Step  2  –  Relevant  trend  data  evaluated.  This  step  is  facilitated  through  normal information sharing processes outlined in paragraph 3.2. AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   23  Figure 3.2.  Ground Tasking Order Process.  3.3.1.3.  Step 3 – Threat evaluated and Information fused. This step is facilitated through normal information-sharing processes outlined in paragraph 3.2. 3.3.1.4.  Step 4 – GTO is created and approved (see Attachment 6). The GTO should be created using a standardized template that will be user-friendly for flight operations and easily repeatable. A standardized database that uses canned GTO entries could facilitate this process; however, caution should be used to avoid stagnation and/or watering down the  GTO  process.  Once  the  appropriate  GTO  template  is  selected  for  use,  it  should  be approved  by  the  Security  Forces  Staff  Function  S3  prior  to  implementation.  For  this process to be effective, it must be done on a near real-time basis without undue delay due to coordination and staffing processes. 3.3.1.5.  Step 5 – GTO executed in support of DFC’s ID operations. Upon approval of the GTO by the DFC, the S3 implements the order in daily operations. As part of the GTO execution  process,  patrols  should  be  provided  with  a  list  of  information  that  can contribute to the S2’s overall situational awareness. Examples of this information include changes in terrain, disposition of the local populace, etc. 3.3.1.6.  Step  6  –  Patrol  After  Action  Report  (PAAR)  (See  Attachment  7).  Upon completion  of  each  GTO  (per  shift/cycle),  the  responsible  patrol  should  complete  a   24  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 PAAR  capturing  the  relevant  data.  The  PAAR  is  sent  directly  from  the  on-duty Operations Flight to the S2 for analysis. The on-duty Operations Flight should capture the date/time/title of the GTO in the blotter. 3.3.1.6.1.  Completion of PAARs are not  necessary for every scenario.  For instance, patrols conducted in/around combat areas of operation should produce a PAAR after every  patrol;  however,  patrols  conducted  by  CONUS-based  law  enforcement  units can  document  incidents  during  their  shift  utilizing  the  standard  AF  Form  3545, Incident  Report  or  AF  Form  3907,  Field  Interview  Card  rather  than  a  PAAR.  S2 personnel should review the Incident Reports, Field Interview Cards and daily blotter to assess whether additional information is needed from the patrol. 3.3.1.7.  Step 7 – GTO effects assessed. Upon receipt of the PAAR, the S2 will evaluate the  results  and  provide  analysis,  as  appropriate.  This  final  step  results  in  new  raw intelligence to be combined with existing information to begin the cycle over again. AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   25  Chapter 4 INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE BATTLESPACE 4.1.  Introduction.  Intelligence  Preparation  of  the  Operating  Environment  (IPOE)  is  generally performed  at  the  operational  and  strategic  levels  (macro  approach),  while  IPB  is  performed  to support the component commands (micro approach) at the tactical level. IPOE and IPB products generally differ only in terms of their relative purpose, focus, and level of detail. The purpose of IPOE  is  to  support  the  Joint  Force  Commander  by  determining  the  adversary's  probable  intent and  most  likely  COA  for  countering  the  overall  friendly  joint  mission,  whereas  IPB  is specifically  designed  to  support  the  individual  operations  of  the  component  commands.  This handbook will use the most appropriate term of IPB. 4.1.1.  Throughout the spectrum of operations, IPB is a process interwoven into all levels of the  military  decisions  making  process,  the  IDRMP  and  contingency  planning.  The  process itself  involves  thought,  knowledge  of  the  threat,  and  visual  techniques  to  create  and communicate the necessary information to the commander regarding the battlespace and the unit’s  mission  within  the  integrated  battlespace.  It  is  a  continuous  process,  enabling  the commander  to  visualize  the  spectrum  of  friendly  and  adversarial  capabilities/tactics  and weaknesses  within  the  operational  environment;  how  they  are  affected  by  a  variety  of environmental  factors  (e.g.,  weather,  light,  terrain,  political  and  social  conditions);  and  the logical  predictions  of  the  most  likely  and  most  dangerous  enemy  COAs  toward  an installation or an installation’s operations. In turn, these predictions are fed to the DFC’s staff to shape and support ID plans designed to obtain information superiority while mitigating the threat. 4.1.2.  Time permitting, the IPB process is refined to include the analysis of the branches and sequels to an operation and for each individual threat COA. This analytical process builds an extensive database for each potential area in which a unit may be required to operate. This is performed to determine the impact of the threat, environment, and terrain on operations. It is ultimately presented in a graphic format. 4.1.3.  The IPB process consists of four steps. Step 1 is to define the battlespace environment. In  Step  2,  you  will  describe  the  battlespace’s  effects.  You  evaluate  the  threat  in  Step  3. Finally, in Step 4, you will determine threat COAs. 4.2.  Step  1  –  Define  The  Battlespace  Environment.  Identify  for  further  analysis  specific features of the environment or activities within it, and the physical space the mission will occupy within a particular operation.  IAW AFPD 31-1, Integrated Defense, IPB will focus on the BSZ as  this  is  the  area  from  which  the  base  may  be  vulnerable  to  standoff  threats.  This  area  is controlled either directly or  indirectly by security forces, in  a manner consistent with legal  and jurisdictional limitations. 4.2.1.  Identify  significant  characteristics  of  the  environment.  The  focus  of  this  step  is  to identify what aspects of the environment will have a clear impact on enemy and/or friendly COAs.  Initial  requirements  for  this  step  include  available  map  sheets,  city  studies,  and detailed specialized products. Physical characteristics include mountains, rivers, forest, high speed  avenues  of  approach,  etc.  Additional  documents  may  include  history  of  the   26  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 environment,  demographics  of  area  surrounding  the  installation,  ethnic  issues,  economics, religion, and operation-specific information. 4.2.1.1.  Consider threat forces and all other aspects of the environment that may have an effect  on  accomplishing  the  unit’s  mission  such  as:  weather,  infrastructure  (including transportation,  electricity  and  telecommunications),  as  well  as  threat  forces  and  their capabilities.  The  focus  of  the  S2  during  this  phase  will  be  the  aspects  that  affect  the installation’s mission. 4.2.2.  Identify  the  limits  of  the  installation’s  AOI  and  BSZ.  Usually,  the  limits  of  an installation’s BSZ are determined by the maximum capabilities of the enemy to engage and disrupt the installation’s operations. Research during this phase includes the BSZ and should include the AOI, as the AOI may be used to stage operations prior to entering the BSZ (See Attachment  8).  It  may  be  useful  during  this  phase  to  create  maps  or  overlays  of  an installation map that identifies the physical and legal boundaries of the installation, the BSZ and  the  AOI.  The  format  or  type  of  product  is  determined  by  the  S2,  the  DFC,  or  the installation commander. S2s are encouraged to use any/all technology at their disposal (e.g., SIPRNet, Google Earth) in order to produce requested products). 4.2.3.  Establish the limits of the AOI. The AOI for an installation extends beyond the BSZ as enemies can move into the BSZ from surrounding areas without being detected. The area of  interest  encompasses  areas  about  which  the  installation  needs  to  maintain  situational awareness.  The  AOI  around  an  installation  may  encompass  surrounding  major  cities.  The extent  to  which  an  AOI  extends  is  determined  by  the  DFC.  Coordination  with  local  law enforcement  agencies  should  include  information  from  locations  within  your  AOI  in accordance with applicable policy and law. 4.2.4.  Identify the amount of detail required and feasible within the time available for IPB.  The  time  available  for  completion  of  the  IPB  process  may  not  permit  the  luxury  of conducting  each  step  in  detail.  You  can  overcome  this  by  focusing  on  the  parts  of  the  IPB that  are  most  important  to  the  commander  in  planning  and  executing  the  mission.  For example,  the  situation  may  not  require  an  in-depth  analysis  of  all  threat  forces  within  the AOI.  Perhaps  only  certain  threats  (e.g.,  terrorist  threats  rather  than  criminal  threats)  may require  a  complete  evaluation  rather  than  a  summary  of  their  effects  or  capabilities.  Allow the  commander  to  prioritize  your  efforts  in  order  to  produce  the  amount  of  detail  required within  the  available  time.  To  assist  in  this  task,  create  a  visible  timeline  with  major milestones and expectations identified. 4.2.5.  Evaluate existing databases and identify intelligence gaps. Not all the intelligence and information required to evaluate the effects of each characteristic of the battlespace and each threat  will  be  in  the  current  database  or  available  to  you.  Identify  the  gaps  for  the  current operation and submit requests for information (RFIs) for the specific intelligence required to fill  them.  In  order  to  ensure  the  request  meets  the  format  and/or  requirements  of  the MAJCOM,  consider  coordinating  creation/drafting  of  the  RFIs  with  AF  Intelligence  and/or AFOSI personnel. Once the intelligence gaps have been identified, prioritize the information requests using the DFC’s intent to prioritize. 4.2.6.  Collect the information and intelligence required to conduct the remainder of IPB. S-2 personnel  do  not  collect  intelligence;  however,  this  does  not  stop  you  from  tapping  into sources/products  which  are  already  deployed/published  such  as  Air  Force  Intelligence, AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   27  AFOSI, local law enforcement, etc. Identify sources of information that can assist you while conducting  IPB.  Additionally,  submit  RFIs  to  fill  intelligence  gaps.  Ideally,  intelligence operations  enable  one  to  develop  the  perception  of  the  battlespace  and  the  threat  to completely  match  the  actual  situation  on  the  battlespace.  In  reality,  intelligence  will  never eliminate all the unknown aspects that concern a commander and his/her staff. Be prepared to fill gaps with reasonable assumptions and continually send out RFIs to update information on unknown  criteria.  The  references the  HQ  AFSFC  SmartNet  website https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/ can be useful sources of information. located  at 4.3.  Step  2  –  Describe  The  Battlespace’s  Effects.  The  definition  for  describing  the battlespace’s effects is the determination of how the battlespace environment affects both threat and friendly operations. Evaluate and integrate the various factors of the battlespace environment that  affect  both  threat  and  friendly  operations.  Begin  the  evaluation  with  an  analysis  of  the existing and projected conditions of the battlespace environment, and then determine their effects on both friendly and threat operations. 4.3.1.  The  goal  of this step is  to  describe how the factors affect  operations, equipment  and personnel.  Whenever  possible,  it  is  recommended  to  use  color-coded  “stoplight  charts”  to describe aspects of operations or effects on personnel and equipment. Use Mission Capable (green),  Partially  Mission  Capable  (yellow),  or  Non-Mission  Capable  (red)  to  denote capabilities.  For  example,  vehicle  movement  through  a  swamp  would  most  likely  be identified  as  red  (denoting  non-mission  capable)  while  personnel  movement  through  a swamp would be yellow, identifying slowed movement. 4.3.2.  Evaluate the battlespace environment, to include terrain and weather analysis. Certain areas,  or  sectors  of  the  installation,  will  affect  various  types  of  operations  in  differing degrees. During the evaluation,  identify the areas that favor each type of  operation. Terrain analysis within an urban area may focus on high-speed avenues of approach for vehicles to the installation perimeter; whereas, rural or desert areas may not have high-speed avenues of approach.  Instead  you  may  focus  on  portions  of  the  installation  perimeter  fence  that  can easily be climbed or cut without detection or identifying likely locations where surface-to-air missiles may be employed against friendly aircraft. Additional evaluation may focus on low-lying areas of an installation that are prone to flooding or critical assets near the installation perimeter. 4.3.2.1.  Terrain and weather analysis are inseparable. You should have already included the weather’s effects on terrain during terrain analysis. In this sub step, weather analysis evaluates the weather’s direct effects on operations, such as making certain  areas of the installation  inaccessible  or  creating  unsafe  driving  conditions.  If  time  and  resources permit, obtain climatology-based overlays for planning purposes through your supporting Air Force weather unit. 4.3.2.2.  Take the time to coordinate with trained Air Force weather personnel in order to analyze  the  military  aspects  of  weather.  For  instance,  low  visibility  hinders  defensive operations  because  cohesion  and  control  becomes  difficult  to  maintain  and  detection efforts become impeded. The variability of weather can also have a major impact on your operations  if  the  installation  is  potentially  in  the  downwind  range  of  nearby  toxic industrial  chemical/toxic  industrial  chemical  (TIC/TIM)  locations.   Under  some circumstances a hazard plume from a release would affect the installation while in other   28  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 situations  it  would  not.  These  weather  conditions  can  change  frequently  throughout  the response effort. Because of this, it is important to integrate your supporting weather unit into the planning process for weather data, forecasts and weather effects. 4.3.3.  Analyze  other  characteristics  of  the  battlespace.  Other  characteristics  include  all aspects  of  the  battlespace  environment  that  affect  threat  or  friendly  COAs  not  already incorporated into the terrain and weather analysis. These may include: 4.3.3.1.  The presence of criminal involvement around the installation. 4.3.3.2.  Demographics of the local population. 4.3.3.3.  Influence of gangs or other unofficial political elements. 4.3.3.4.  Logistical  or  network  infrastructure  on  or  off  the  installation  which  contributes to the installation’s mission. 4.3.3.5.  Once  you  have  identified  the  other  characteristics  of  the  battlespace,  you  must express it in terms of how it affects friendly and enemy COAs. For this task you may use a  Modified  Combined  Obstacle  Overlay  (MCOO)  which  will  help  you  depict  the battlespace’s  effects  on  operations.  This  will  identify  such  key  items  as  objectives, defensible terrain, likely engagement areas and key terrain (see Attachment 9). 4.3.4.  Describe the battlespace’s effects on threat and friendly capabilities and broad COAs. Accomplish this step by combining the evaluation of the effects of terrain, weather and other characteristics  of  the  battlespace  into  one  integrated  product.  Address  the  battlespace’s effects  on  threat  as  well  as  friendly  COAs.  A  good  technique  for  accomplishing  this  is  to completely  place  yourself  in  the  perspective  of  the  threat’s  S2  position  who  must  also recommend  a  set  of  COAs  to  his/her  commander.  Evaluate  the  effects  of  the  battlespace environment  on  threat  COAs  considering  the  specific  threat  your  installation  is  facing. Following are some examples to consider: 4.3.4.1.  Weather  may  affect  threat  equipment  differently  than  US  equipment.  For example, an AK-47 is more resistant to moisture than an M-16. Likewise, fog will affect US thermal sights less than it will affect vehicles with optical sights only. 4.3.4.2.  Engagement  areas  and  ambush  sites.  Using  the  results  of  evaluating  cover  and concealment,  identify  areas  where  maneuvering  forces  are  vulnerable  to  fires.  Consider weapon ranges, missile flight  times and the likely  speed of maneuvering forces.  If  your command is attacking, these are areas where it will be vulnerable to enemy fires. If your command is defending, these are potential engagement areas. 4.4.  Step 3 – Evaluate The Threat.  The third step in the IPB process is to evaluate the threat in terms of the commander’s requirements. In this step, the threat is determined, information gaps are  identified,  and  additional  RFIs  are  forwarded  to  attempt  to  fill  the  gaps.  The  end  result produces a threat model that describes threat actors and their associated capabilities and tactics. See  DOD  ATO  Guide  for  information  regarding  compiling  the  threat  matrix  and  utilizing  that information to formulate the most likely and most dangerous COAs. This information should be used  in  the  IDRMP  in  order  to  determine  the  amount  of  risk  posed  to  installation assets/operations. Unanswered questions and gaps in intelligence greatly hinder future planning and analysis. AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   29  4.4.1.  You may begin this step by obtaining DIA country reports or the AFOSI installation LTA  of  the  operating  environment,  or  other  reports  about  the  adversaries  capable  of operating in your AOI. However, it should not stop with these reports. You must utilize the elements  of  these  reports  to  guide  you  when  seeking  additional  information  in  order  to determine the on-the-ground possibility of the enemy’s presence and intentions. Often this is dependent upon the operational environment (CONUS, OCONUS and expeditionary) and is normally  provided  through  your  local  AFOSI  detachment.  Consider  the  capabilities  and weaknesses  of  each  specific  group  without  assuming  that  all  enemy  forces  collaborate. Consider  and  evaluate  the  effects  of  the  operating  environment  (gathered  in  Part  1  and evaluated in Part 2) on each individual adversary. 4.4.2.  The desired end result is to know the threat and to determine their capabilities, given the current situation. Develop threat models which accurately portray aggressor TTPs under normal conditions. All threat actors can be evaluated through doctrine, patterns of behavior, historical references, and reactions to similar situations. 4.4.3.  Identify  the  threat.  First,  identify  and  evaluate  threat  databases  for  complete  and accurate  threat  compositions,  strengths,  and  dispositions.  Intelligence  gaps  should  be identified  immediately,  allowing  time  to  develop  and  submit  requests  for  information  to outside  agencies.  This  step  involves  in-depth  and  continuous  coordination  with  outside agencies and normally accomplished through AFOSI and AF Intelligence for the information needed. Sources of information can include, but are not limited to: 4.4.3.1.  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Intelligence 4.4.3.2.  DIA 4.4.3.3.  National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency (NGA) 4.4.3.4.  National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) 4.4.3.5.  INTELINK 4.4.3.6.  USNORTHCOM 4.4.3.7.  AFNORTH 4.4.3.8.  AFSOUTH 4.4.3.9.  Global Terrorism Database 4.4.3.10.  National Counterterrorism Center 4.4.3.11.  Defense Counterterrorism Center 4.4.3.12.  CJCS/J2 4.4.3.13.  USSTRATCOM SkiWeb 4.4.3.14.  Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) 4.4.3.15.  National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) *NOTE:  Sources referenced in 4.2.6 may also be helpful during this step. 4.4.4.  Update  and  create  threat  models.  Threat  models  depict  how  threat  actors  prefer  to conduct operations under ideal conditions. They are based upon the identified threat’s normal   30  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 organization, equipment,  doctrine,  and TTPs. Threat  models result from  a detailed study of the  aggressor.    Ideally,  threat  models  are  constructed  and  evaluated  prior  to  deployment. After  deployment,  continuous  evaluation  of  the  threat  and  updating  the  threat  models  are required. 4.4.4.1.  The  threat  model  should  include  preferred  tactics  and  targets  of  threats  to  the installation, i.e., local threat actors that are present and have the capability and intent to negatively  impact  installation  mission,  personnel  and  resources.  Any/all  historical information should be included so as to  contribute to the most accurate prediction. This information should be constantly updated to reflect any changes and can/should include: 4.4.4.1.1.  Composition.  What  is  the  make-up  of  the  enemy  force?  Does  it  include active cadre, recruiters, supporters, etc.? 4.4.4.1.2.  Disposition. What  are the tendencies of the enemy force? Do they have a history of targeting US interests? 4.4.4.1.3.  Strength. How many members belong to the enemy force? 4.4.4.1.4.  Tactics. What type of tactics does the enemy force employ? 4.4.4.1.5.  Training  Status.  Does  the  enemy  force  have  an  active  training  program? Do they have the capability to train new recruits in order to replenish their numbers? 4.4.4.1.6.  Logistics.  Does  the  enemy  force  have  the  capability  to  procure,  maintain, and transport equipment and personnel in order to facilitate an attack? 4.4.4.1.7.  Effectiveness.  Can  the  enemy  force  produce  the  intended  results  of  their mission? 4.4.5.  Identify  threat  capabilities.  At  the  installation  level,  concern  regarding  threat capabilities  is  usually  focused  down  to  what  tactics  an  aggressor  is  capable  of  employing (e.g.,  sniping,  Vehicle  Borne  Improvised  Explosive  Device  (VBIED),  drive-by  shooting, etc.). 4.4.5.1.  Threat capabilities are the broad COAs and support operations which aggressors take  to  influence  the  accomplishment  of  friendly  operations.  They  take  the  form  of statements, such as: 4.4.5.1.1.  The  threat  has  the  capability  to  launch  Surface-to-air-missiles  (SAM) attacks. 4.4.5.1.2.  The threat has access to CBRN weapons. 4.4.5.1.3.  The protestors can effectively block traffic at no more than seven different intersections. 4.4.5.2.  Begin with the full set of tactics and consider the threat’s ability to conduct each operation  based  upon  the  current  situation.  Example:  A  terrorist  group's  normal  TTPs may  call  for  the  use  of  car  bombs  or  similar  devices  to  tie  down  emergency  services while  they  conduct  raids  in  other  parts  of  town.  Your  evaluation  of  the  threat's  current logistics status, however, might indicate a critical shortage of explosive materials. 4.4.5.3.  Disseminate the results of evaluating the threat as widely as possible. At the very least,  this  information  should  be  shared  with  S-3  personnel,  and  TII  contributors  (as AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   31  applicable).  This  allows  other  staff  sections  and  units  to  include  them  in  their  own assessments. 4.5.  Step  4  –  Determine  Threat  COAs.  The final step of the IPB process is to determine the various threat COAs that will influence the accomplishment of friendly operations. The goal of this entire exercise is to replicate the set of COAs that the aggressors are considering based upon the friendly situation. The majority of your focus during this step should be applied to the most likely  and  most  dangerous  enemy  COAs.  Utilize  the  resulting  threat  COAs,  along  with  other facts and assumptions about the battlespace environment, to drive the wargaming process and to develop friendly COAs. 4.5.1.  Identify  the  threat’s  likely  objectives  and  desired  end  state.  Begin  this  step  by attempting to identify what the goal of the enemy is (desired end state). The next step is to consider the threat COAs that could significantly influence the installation’s mission, even if the threat’s doctrine considers them infeasible or sub-optimum under current conditions. 4.5.1.1.  Consider any indirect or "wildcard" COAs that the threat is capable of executing. 4.5.1.2.  Consider the threat COAs indicated by recent activities and incidents. 4.5.1.3.  Consider  all  possible  explanations  for  the  threat's  activity  in  terms  of  possible COAs to avoid surprise from an unanticipated COA. 4.5.1.4.  Consider  each  subset  of  COAs  independently  to  avoid  forming  biases  that restrict  the  analysis  and  evaluation.  Once  each  subset  is  evaluated  separately,  combine them to eliminate redundancy and minor variations. 4.5.1.5.  Compare  the  consolidated  list  of  threat  capabilities  identified  in  Step  3  of  the IPB process and eliminate any COA the threat is incapable of executing. 4.5.1.6.  Once you have identified all of the COAs above, consider the suitability of each COA to the desired end states of the threat.  If the COA is successfully executed, will it accomplish the threat’s objectives? 4.5.1.7.  Consider the feasibility of each threat COA to determine if the COA is feasible. Does the threat possess the capability, time, and resources to carry out the COA? 4.5.2.  Once  you  have  identified  all  probable  COAs,  the  next  step  is  to  mold  intelligence collection  requests  in  order  to  answer  specific  questions  that,  when  observed,  reveal  which COAs the aggressor has chosen. These activities are called indicators. 4.5.3.  Once  persistent  threat  information  has  been  developed  it  should  be  applied  to  the commander’s  IDRMP  to  identify  any  changes  to  risk.    IAW  AFI  31-101  and  AFI  10-245, Antiterrorism,  the  commander’s  ForcePRO  tool  should  also  be  updated  to  reflect  current threat information. 4.5.4.  The  SIO  will  be  able  to  provide  the  S2  with  many  of  the  documents/information required for the S2 to accomplish their mission. This may include the following: 4.5.5.  Indications and warnings (emerging crisis situations). 4.5.6.  Current intelligence (adversary intentions and/or courses of action). 4.5.7.  General  military  intelligence  (adversary  Order  of  Battle  (OB),  cultural  awareness information).   32  AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015 4.5.8.  Adversary  capabilities,  TTPs,  terrorist  group  historical  background  and  intent, finished  intelligence,  terrain  analysis,  route  analysis,  man-portable  air  defense  system (MANPADS)/stand-off weapons footprints, cyber threat, etc. 4.6.  Tips for Success. 4.6.1.  Work ahead. The best solution is to complete as much work ahead of time as possible.  Establish  a  series  of  base  products,  particularly  those  that  deal  with  the  battlespace environment's  effects  on  operations.  Keep  them  updated  by  periodic  review  instead  of waiting until receipt of a new mission or threat. 4.6.2.  Become  familiar  with  the  support  available  to  you  from  intelligence  systems  and support  agencies.  Know  how  to  get  what  you  need  before  you  need  it  by  networking  and educating yourself with the support available. Think through methods to get support before, during, and after an incident. 4.6.3.  Focus on essentials. Decide which products will be developed and to what degree of detail. Focus on the products most important to the mission. Rather than fully developing one threat COA at the expense of others, identify the full range of available COAs. Determine the degree of detail required and then develop all COAs to that level of detail. 4.6.4.  Ensure your information is vetted. Never assume data provided or gleaned from open sources is factual. Always try to vet information through second and third sources wherever possible. Use classified sources and information to validate information whenever available; however, reference unclassified sources as often as possible to allow for wider distribution of information.  Use  validation  (i.e.,  possible,  probable,  actual)  so  as  not  to  compromise  your assessments and COAs. 4.6.5.  Know  what  you  know,  what  you  don’t,  and  what  you  need  to  fill  in  the  intelligence gaps.  Keep  in  mind  that  the  first  and  foremost  source  for  building  your  product  and assessment  is  the  intelligence  community.  The  majority  of  the  time,  the  intelligence community has already built IPOE or IPB for every AOI around the globe. Work smarter, not harder.  Try  to  never  “recreate  the  wheel”  and  attempt  to  build  your  products  from  scratch. The relationship developed between the TII partners is essential to building factual, concise, and  relevant  products  for  the  decision  makers.  It  is  essential  to  know  available  sources  of information and how to gain vital information from stakeholders via RFIs. 4.6.6.  When  developing  the  IPB,  AOI,  and/or  COAs,  focus  on  the  operating  environment, terrain,  demographics,  and  known  and  suspected  adversarial  TTPs.  Once  developed, continuously  evaluate and update, as some factors (e.g., TTPs) will  change and some  (e.g., terrain) will mostly remain constant, but the operating environment itself constantly evolves. AFH31-115V1  29 APRIL 2015   33  4.6.7.  Your  most  critical  asset  in  the  process  will  be  your  battle  partners  within  the  TII community. They will aid, assist, and oftentimes author the initial product along with updates if asked. If you don’t ask, you are severely hampering your assessment and COAs, and likely endangering friendly forces. The more information, the better. If all else fails, get operations and intelligence experts together to help you develop your product.  JUDITH A.
