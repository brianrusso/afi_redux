Have a wingman go up the stairs to check for all lights, anti-skid paper, safety rails and side rail levers.  Side rails should lock into place.  Safety rails should slide smoothly, be secure and undamaged.  Note:  Warning.  Do NOT check if wind conditions are over 35 knots.    5.3.1.3.7.5.  After the wingman is off of the steps, raise the outriggers/stabilizers, lower the stairs and set the A Frame into the position.  Turn off the step lights.  5.3.1.3.7.6.  With the parking brake set, put the vehicle into gear and ensure it does not move. 5.3.1.3.7.7.  Put the vehicle into park and take-off the parking brake.

Driving Safety and Precautions.  5.5.1.  Overhead clearance.  Staircase trucks have a very high profile and extra care must be taken to ensure overhead clearances.  The operator is responsible for knowing the height of the vehicle and ensuring overhead clearance.  5.5.2.  The staircase truck is not designed for highway use.  The front suspension is practically solid and care must be taken when driving on rough roads.  Do not drive off hard surfaces.  5.5.3.  Staircase trucks cannot be used in high winds.  Base Operations will close the flightline when required.  5.5.4.  Never start the engine from any place other than the operator’s position.  5.5.5.  Never drive the staircase truck up to any individual standing in front of an object. 5.5.6.  Always use spotters.  See AFMAN 24-306. 5.5.7.  Always  keep  fingers  and  other  body  parts  away  from  cables  and  stair  extending mechanisms, when in operation. 5.5.8.  Never allow anyone to stand directly behind the staircase truck when the staircase is being raised. 5.5.9.  Never allow anyone to stand on the staircase when it is being raised or extended. 5.5.10.  Never  allow  anyone  to  stand  on  the  staircase  or  platform  unless  outriggers  are extended to the ground. 5.5.11.  Ensure the platform side guardrails are forward before stairs are used. 5.5.12.  Never stand between the truck frame and the stabilizer arms when the stabilizer arms are in the stowed position.  Stabilizer retaining pins must be installed by reaching over the stabilizer arm. 5.5.13.  Ensure all treads in staircase have non-skid tape applied. 5.5.14.  No recap tires on the front.  5.5.15.  Tire changing procedures.  In the event that the vehicle has a flat or damaged tire, the trainee must know how to safely change the tire.  5.5.15.1.   Ensure the following tools/equipment are used while changing the damaged flat tire:  Vehicle jack with jack handle, lug wrench, jack stand, wheel chocks, hand/eye/hearing protection and steel-toed boots.  5.5.15.2.   Ensure the vehicle is seated on a level surface.  5.5.15.3.   Chock the adjacent drive wheel.  5.5.15.4.   Locate the solid part of the vehicle’s frame.  5.5.15.5.   Place the vehicle jack under the vehicle’s frame, as close as possible without impeding tire removal and replacement.  5.5.15.6.   Raise the vehicle with the jack until the vehicle’s weight is supported on the jack but the tire is still in contact with the ground.  5.5.15.7.   Loosen, do NOT remove, the lug nuts.  5.5.15.8.   Jack the vehicle up an extra inch to allow the replacement of the tire.  5.5.15.9.   Place the jack stand under the frame of the vehicle to support the vehicle in case the jack’s hydraulics should leak and/or fail.  5.5.15.10.  Remove the vehicle’s lug nuts.         Note:  If the inside of the dual tire is flat and/or damaged, the separation ring must be removed and the inside wheel studs (if equipped) must be removed to remove the damaged/flat tire.  5.5.15.11.  Remove the vehicle’s flat/damaged tire.  5.5.15.12.  Place the replacement tire into the vehicle’s axle.  5.5.15.13.  Replace the vehicle’s lug nuts (to hand tightness).  5.5.15.14.  Jack the vehicle up and remove the jack stand.  5.5.15.15.  Lower the vehicle until it makes contact with the ground.  5.5.15.16.  Tighten the vehicle’s lug nuts.  Note:  As soon as possible, take the vehicle to the Vehicle Maintenance tire shop and have the vehicle’s wheel torqued to manufacturer’s specifications.  5.6. Staircase Truck Operation.  5.6.1.  Operators  must  be  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  safety  precautions,  principles  of operation,  location  and  use  of  controls  and  accessories  and  handling  characteristics  of  the vehicle before attempting any operation or service procedure.  Refer to the specific vehicle’s Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual or applicable TO for more detailed information.  5.6.2.  Principals of operation.  5.6.2.1.  The operator must know the mission and capabilities that the vehicle will provide.  The specific weight and height ratings for the vehicle can be found in the manufacturer’s operator’s manual.  This will vary from vehicle to vehicle.  The trainee will be taught the following operating procedures:  5.6.3.  Starting procedures.  5.6.4.  Observing gauges and performing an operations check.  5.6.5.  Procedures for approaching the aircraft.  5.6.6.  Positioning the staircase truck at the aircraft, adjusting the stairs to the desired height, positioning the chock on the ground at the aircraft and extending the outriggers (if applicable).  Note:  Extending the outriggers out is only applicable to specific C5 staircase truck models.  For all other models, do not extend until the staircase truck is in the final position at the aircraft. CAUTION - Do not proceed closer than 10 feet to the aircraft until all of these steps have been accomplished.     5.6.7.  Use of spotters.  5.6.8.  Final adjustments to the aircraft:  5.6.8.1.

Place vehicle into a low gear. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. Repeat the same steps for the trailer with trailer parking brake set and power unit parking brakes released (if applicable). If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. 7.  Start the Engine and Check Test for Hydraulic Leaks  o o • o o o o o o • • Any unusual brake pedal "feel" or delayed stopping action can mean trouble. If the trainee finds anything unsafe during the Vehicle inspection, get it fixed. Federal and state laws forbid operating an unsafe vehicle. Check vehicle operation regularly: Instruments. Air pressure gauge (if the vehicle has air brakes). Temperature gauges. Pressure gauges. Ammeter/voltmeter. Mirrors. Tires. If the trainee sees, hears, smells, or feels anything that might mean trouble, he/she should check it out. Safety inspection. Document any discrepancy on AF Form 1800.
