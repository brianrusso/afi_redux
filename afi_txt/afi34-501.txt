Scope.  This  instruction establishes guidance and assigns responsibilities for the Air Force Mortuary  Affairs  program.    The  Mortuary  Affairs  program  provides  for  the  recovery, segregation,  identification,  care,  and  disposition  of  the  decedent’s  remains  prescribed  in  this instruction  in  peacetime  and  wartime  across  the  range  of  military  operations.    It  also  provides guidance  for  the  provision  of  entitlements  and  communication  with  the  Person  Authorized  to Direct Disposition (PADD) of the remains. 1.1.1.  Training.    Due  to  the  highly  sensitive  nature  of  this  program,  commanders  and supervisors at all levels must ensure all personnel involved in the Mortuary Affairs program are properly trained and proficient in the execution of their Mortuary Affairs duties.  (T-0) 1.1.2.  Installation  Mortuary  Plan.    Current  installation  mortuary  plans  are  essential  to  the proper execution of the mortuary affairs program and must be reviewed and amended as new information becomes available and resources change.  Since no two situations are alike and the number of fatalities can never be predicted, plans should be able to be adjusted to meet unanticipated  situations.    Installation  mortuary  plans  will  include  provisions  for  individual deaths, mass casualties, and contamination. (T-1) 1.2.  Overview  of  the  Mortuary  Affairs  Program.  Provides  support  across  the  full  range  of military operations and is  divided into three distinct  programs  the Current  Death  Sub-Program, the Graves Registration Sub-Program and the Concurrent Return Sub-Program.  Components of these programs include search and recovery (S&R); determining Believed To Be (BTB) status, if possible;  transportation  of  remains;  management  of  DoD  mortuary  facilities;  and  mortuary services. (T-0) 1.2.1.  The  Current  Death  Sub-Program.    Eligible  personnel  are  provided  with  professional mortuary  services  (removal,  identification,  preparation,  and  disposition  of  remains)  and supplies (clothing, casket, etc.) incident to care and disposition of remains of persons who are eligible  for  these  services  by  specific  statute.    The  sub-program  is  operational  worldwide during peacetime.  It will continue outside areas of conflict during major military operations.  The  sub-program  also  may  continue  in  areas  of  conflict  depending  on  the  logistical  and tactical situation.  (T-0) 1.2.2.  The  Graves  Registration  Sub-Program.    Provides  for  search,  recovery,  determining BTB  status,  if  possible,  and  evacuation  of  remains  to  a  theater  mortuary  affairs  activity (MACP  or  TMEP)  or  temporary  burial  site.    Temporary  burial  is  performed  only  when authorized  by  the  responsible  geographic  combatant  commander  during  major  military operations.    Remains  buried  temporarily  will  be  disinterred  and  evacuated  under  the Concurrent Return Sub-Program as conditions and capabilities permit. (T-0) 1.2.3.  The  Concurrent  Return  Sub-Program.    Is  a  combination  of  the  Current  Death  Sub-Program  and  the  Graves  Registration  Sub-Program.    This  sub-program  may  be  activated during  emergencies  or  major  military  operations  when  conditions  and  capabilities  permit.  The sub- program begins with the initial phase of the Graves Registration Sub-Program, and   18  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 provides  for  search,  recovery,  and  evacuation  of  remains.    The  sub-program  ends  with  the Current  Death  Program,  which  provides  for  identification  and  preparation  of  remains  in  a mortuary or central  identification laboratory and  shipment  to  destination, as directed by the PADD.  The Concurrent Return Sub-Program  may  be phased into either  the Current Death Sub-Program or the Graves Registration Sub-Program, as the situation dictates. (T-0) 1.2.4.  CONUS/OCONUS Defined.  For mortuary purposes, CONUS includes the contiguous states,  Alaska,  Hawaii,  Guam,  Puerto  Rico,  and  US  Virgin  Islands.    All  other  geographic areas are considered OCONUS. 1.3.  Related Programs. 1.3.1.  The  Personal  Property  and  Effects  Program.    Provides  for  disposition  of  personal effects (PE) and property of missing, captured and deceased Air Force military and civilian personnel, which is addressed in detail in AFI 34-511, Disposition of Personal Property and Effects. (T-0) 1.3.2.  The  Installation  Honor  Guard  Program.    Provides  for  the  rendering  of  ceremonial honors and military funeral honors.  All guidance provided in Chapter 8 must be followed in the execution of the Installation Honor Guard Program. (T-0) Section 1B—Mortuary Affairs Program Roles and Responsibilities 1.4.

Once  a  physician  pronounces  death  at  the  location  of  death  or  the  Medical Treatment  Facility  (MTF),  he/she  prepares  the  death  certificate,  and  gains  a  decision regarding  an  autopsy.    The  MTF  or  Medical  Group  must  notify  the  local  coroner  or medical examiner to ensure a burial, removal, or transit permit is issued allowing for the forward  movement  of  remains.    The  Installation  Commander  and/or  Medical  Group Commander,  in  consultation  with  the  AFMES,  will  determine  if  an  autopsy  is  to  be performed.    If  an  autopsy  is  to  be  performed  at  the  MTF,  the  Medical  Group  provides transportation of the deceased from the site of death (or presumed death).  If an autopsy will  not  be  performed  at  the  MTF,  then  mortuary  affairs  is  responsible  for  arranging transportation of remains.

This chapter addresses the planning actions required for establishing a competent, trained  S&R  team  and  the  actions  that  must  be  taken  during  an  actual  mishap  involving  Air Force assets and/or Air Force personnel. 6.2.  National  Incident  Management  System  (NIMS).  The  Air  Force  is  aligning  its  S&R capability  within  the  NIMS.    The  NIMS  represents  a  core  set  of  doctrine,  concepts,  principles, terminology,  and  organizational  processes  to  enable  effective,  efficient,  and  collaborative incident  management  at  all  levels.    For  ease  of  ordering  and  tracking,  response  assets  are categorized via resource typing. 6.3.  S&R  Team.  S&R  operations  are  conducted  by  installation  S&R  teams  and  may  be accompanied by member(s) of AFMAO based upon consultation between the Mortuary Officer and the AFMAO/CC and with approval by the Emergency Operations Center Director.  (T-1) 6.3.1.  Installation  S&R.    Have  11  members  trained  and  equipped  to  handle  basic  S&R operations.    The  specific  manning,  training,  and  equipment  requirements  are  detailed  in Tables 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4  (T-1) 6.4.  Installation Requirement for a S&R Team. 6.4.1.  Installations  with  military  assigned  to  FSS.    Will  have  an  installation  S&R  team properly  trained,  manned,  and  equipped  to  respond  to  mishaps  when  required.

The Safety Investigation Board (SIB).  Investigates mishaps when there has been loss of  life.  The  board  is  usually  on  scene  within  72  hours  following  a  mishap.    The  Incident Commander assumes control of the scene.  The SIB President assumes control of the safety investigation  under  the  provisions  of  AFI  91-204,  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports.    The SIB Medical Officer trained in life support systems will be responsible for  the life sciences aspect of the investigation and will supervise the identification process.  (T-1) 6.11.6.  The  Interim  Safety  Investigation  Board  (ISIB)  Medical  Officer.    The  ISIB  Medical Officer and the Mortuary Officer assigned by the commander of the  Air Force base nearest the  mishap  will  initially  collect  life  sciences  evidence  in  an  aircraft  mishap.    This  will  be done before the permanent SIB Medical Officer arrives.  Together they will accomplish the following: 6.11.6.1.  Preserve  perishable  evidence,  to  include  video  and  still  photography  at  the mishap site, collecting laboratory samples, completing radiological studies and obtaining initial witness statements.  (T-1) 6.11.6.2.  Ensure  nonperishable  evidence  associated  with  human  remains  (life  support equipment, aircraft egress systems, etc.) is left undisturbed at the mishap site.  (T-1) 6.11.6.3.

Facilitate access of the AFMES medical examiner to the dead and injured.  (T-1) 6.11.6.5.  Obtain health and dental records of the decedents. (T-1) 6.11.7.  CE will provide GPS and/or optical survey equipment and trained personnel  to plot remains, personal effects, and aircraft wreckage.  Daily maps will be produced and archived to reflect S&R progress.  (T-1) 6.11.8.  PA will provide photographer support.  (T-1) 6.12.  Search  Tactics  and  Techniques.  Refer  to  AFH  10-247,  Volume  4,  Guide  to  Services Contingency Planning: Mortuary Affairs Search and Recovery, for detailed instructions. 6.13.  Recovery  Operations  Instructions.  Recovery  is  the  most  important  and  demanding phase  of  the  field  operation  and  is  time  sensitive.    Valuable  investigative  information, identification of remains and mishap clues can easily be destroyed by hasty/incomplete recovery actions.  The Mortuary Officer will work closely with the medical officer to ensure remains are properly examined, staked, tagged, photographed and plotted using GPS before removal.  When GPS (CE) is not available, hand-drawn maps/sketches will be produced and used.  (T-1) 6.13.1.  Recovery operations must be carefully coordinated, since the tagging and designation of remains and portions of remains is vitally important in later examination of these remains.  NOTE:  Recovery team may be the same as the S&R team, or could be the augmentees.  (T-1) AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   101  6.13.2.  The recovery team will consist of approximately nine members (1 – team leader and 8 persons recovering remains), a Public Affairs photographer/videographer, and CE member with GPS.  This selection provides efficient use of manpower as well as an available source of replacements.  (T-1) 6.13.3.  Remains are usually dismembered and/or burned.   In many mishaps, there may not be 100% recovery.  Unit members must handle remains and personal effects with the utmost care to ensure against loss or destruction of valuable identification media or evidence.  (T-1). NOTE:  No remains will be moved or disturbed without the consent of the ISB/SIB Medical Officer or Incident Commander. 6.13.4.  Use helicopters, if available, to visually survey the terrain and assist in determining the overall area to be searched. 6.14.  The Recovery Process. 6.14.1.  Each  stake  will  be  marked  with  the  appropriate  letter  designation:    "R"  for  intact remains, "P" for partial or fragmented remains and "E" for personal effects. An “R” number will be assigned to any item found that constitutes more than 50 percent of a human body and includes  a  majority  of  the  torso.  The  team  leader  will  make  this  determination.  Items  not representing more than 50 percent are classified as a portion and will receive a sequential “P” number. A torso will be marked as human remains. Body regions such as an isolated head or legs, even if attached at the pelvis, will be marked as portions.  Each letter will be followed by  sequential  numbering  (example,  R-1,  P-1,  P-2)  using  consecutive  recovery  numbers  for each stake.  (T-1) 6.14.2.  When a GPS is available, the location of each stake will be plotted to  include “R”, “P” or “E” numbers.  (T-3) 6.14.3.  Three  tags  will  be  used  for  each  remains  (or  portion  thereof)  found.    The  R-  or  P-number must be written on each tag.  One tag will be attached to the stake.  The second tag will  be  attached  to  the  remains  themselves.    The  third  tag  will  be  attached  to  the  human remains pouch (HRP) or Ziploc-type bag the remains, or effects, are placed in.  (T-1) 6.14.4.  A color photograph must be taken of each remains with the tag’s “R- or P-number” showing.  The  photograph  or  videotape  must  include  a  close-up  shot  of  the  remains  and  an image  depicting  the  remains  in  relationship  to  the  majority  of  the  wreckage  or  the  mishap scene.    If  there  are  a  large  number  of  fragmented  portions,  a  master  tag  will  be  affixed  to humans remains pouch (HRP).  (T-1) 6.14.5.  The remains will be carefully placed in a human remains pouch (HRP) or plastic bag.  Handling  will  be  minimized  to  prevent  undue  damage.    If  there  are  a  large  number  of fragmented portions, a master tag will be affixed to the HRP.  (T-1) 6.14.6.  The ground beneath the remains and the immediate area will be carefully examined to assure all portions are recovered.  (T-1) 6.14.7.  Once a photo or video has been taken of the remains, the third tag, marked with the same R- or P-number, must be securely attached to the outside of the pouch or plastic bag.  (T-1) 6.14.8.  The remains must  be iced or refrigerated as soon as possible to  reduce degradation and transported by mortuary personnel to the temporary collection point or morgue.  (T-1)   102  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 6.14.9.  Additional information required on each tag is as follows:  Recovery mission number (assigned  by  AFMAO),  Recovery  Organization,  Branch  of  Service,  Date,  Believed  to  Be (BTB) name if available or appropriate (place the BTB information on the tag reverse side).  Exceptions  to  this  policy  will  be  considered  when  there  are  large  numbers  of  small fragmented portions.  A master tag will be affixed to the HRP with the info above to include the sequential P-numbers contained inside the HRP (i.e., P1-P300).  All fragmented portions will be individually bagged and tagged with the appropriate P-number.  (T-1) 6.14.10.  On-scene  Mortuary  Officer/AFMAO  will  provide  guidance  and  request  the Accident Investigation Board (AIB) and or SIB President to retain either recovered remains on scene, or at a central holding location until S&R is terminated.  (T-1) 6.14.11.  Building  Searches.   A  floor-by-floor  and  room-by-room  search  will  be accomplished  when  conducting  S&R  operations  in  buildings  that  have  been  damaged  or destroyed  by  explosions,  fire,  aircraft,  or  weather.    Buildings  should  be  determined  to  be structurally  safe  before  S&R  team  enters  it.    Numbering  system  for  remains  and  personal effects  will  reflect  floor  and  room  number  (i.e.,  F1R320R-1  would  represent  a  remains recovered  on  first  floor,  room  320).    S&R  operations  may  be  under  the  control  of  civil authorities (i.e., location is  a federal  crime scene).   In  cases  where remains are in  damaged structures close  coordination with  the fire department and structural  safety  representative is essential.    If  the  structure  is  not  sound,  remains  will  be  recovered  as  debris  is  removed.  Advance  coordination  with  your  base  fire  department  is  needed  to  ensure  the  assistance  of the Urban S&R team is available.  S&R teams are not trained to perform recovery operations in confined spaces or collapsed structures.  (T-1) 6.15.  Termination of S&R.  AFMAO and the MAJCOM/A1 will be notified telephonically and through email when S&R operations are terminated.  Frequently, portions of remains are found adhered to or under aircraft parts.  Leave the team leader and at least five S&R team members at the  scene  to  be  present  during  salvage  operations  should  there  be  subsequent  recovery.    (T-1). NOTE:    Because  of  the  possibility  of  subsequent  recovery  when  remains  are  not  intact,  the Mortuary Officer must not request disposition instructions prior to termination of aircraft salvage operations  without  the  approval  of  AFMAO.    The  MAJCOM/A1  and  AFMAO  will  be  kept advised of salvage operation status changes by telephone and e-mail.  (T-1) 6.16.  Recovered Personal Property and Effects. 6.16.1.  Personal  property  and effects  will not  be removed  from  remains  at  the mishap site.  This  will  include  official  cards  (line  badge,  ID  card,  etc.)  and  papers,  nametags  and accoutrements from remains at the mishap site.  These items will be left with the remains, to preserve supportive identification evidence.  (T-1) 6.16.2.  Personal  effects  (PE)  found  loose  at  the  site  will  be  annotated  on  the  site  map  and placed  in  plastic  bags  secured  with  wire  tie  shipping  tags.    The  letter  "E"  will  be  indicated (denoting personal effects) on each tag followed by the consecutive recovery number E-1, E-2, etc.  The items must be safeguarded and delivered to the identification processing facility.  The  Mortuary  Officer  will  be  directly  responsible  for  loose  personal  effects.    PE  will  be inventoried  and  annotated  on  DD  Form  1076,  Record  of  Personal  Effects  of  Deceased Personnel.  (T-1) AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   103  6.16.3.  There should not  be any attempt to  re-associate personal  property  or accoutrements found  loose  at  the  mishap  site  until  the  remains are  processed  and  identified.    If  an  item  is believed  to  be  associated  with  remains,  note  on  the  reverse  side  BTB  associated  with  R-number or P-number.  (T-1) 6.17.  Handling  Recovered  Remains.  Since  medical  and  life  support  clues  are  time  sensitive and fragile, it is imperative that no remains be disturbed after recovery until the Medical Officer conducts the investigation.  It is especially important that clothing and equipment remain intact.  Usually,  the  Medical  Officer  has  the  medical  records  at  the  time  of  examination  and  autopsy.  The ISB/SIB Medical Officer will supervise the identification process.  If positive identification cannot  be  established,  AFMAO  personnel  responding  to  the  mishap  will  assist  the  Medical Officer from the agency that has jurisdiction (local coroner, medical examiner or AFMES) with identification.    The  Medical  Officer  will  release  the  remains  to  the  Mortuary  Officer  for processing following completion of all medical actions.  (T-1). NOTE:  Clothing and equipment removed from remains will not be destroyed without Medical Officer coordination. 6.17.1.  Preservation of Remains.  The remains must be refrigerated at a temperature of 34 to 40  degrees  Fahrenheit  or  3.3  to  4.4  degrees  Centigrade.    If  refrigeration  equipment  is  not readily available nor leasable, pack bagged remains in ice or ice packs in insulated chests or in  a  transfer  case,  depending  on  size  of  the  remains.    Ice  will  not  be  placed  directly  on remains.  (T-1) 6.17.2.  Facilities for Processing Remains (Temporary Morgue).  Ensure that the facility used for  identification  processing  of  remains  can  be  secured,  has  proper  ventilation  and  good lighting, has hot and cold running water, sufficient floor space for simultaneous processing of remains, and loading/unloading areas that can be screened from public view.  Aircraft hangar or  warehouses  are  suitable  structures.    Gymnasiums  and  other  FSS  facilities  used  to  serve customers  will  be  used  as  a  last  resort.    Installations  will  identify  facilities  to  be  used  as  a temporary morgue in their installation mortuary plans.  (T-1) 6.17.3.  Forensic Pathology  Investigations.   The  AFMES may  conduct a  forensic pathology investigation  to  determine  the  cause  of  death  of  a  deceased  person  IAW  DoDI  5154.30, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Operations.  (T-1) 6.18.  After  Action  Comments.  NLT  30  days  after  completion  of  S&R  operations,  the Mortuary  Officer  will  submit  after  action  comments  to  AFMAO  through  their  MAJCOM.  Include  the  location  of  the  incident,  the  start  and  end  date  of  S&R  operations,  the  number  of fatalities, lessons learned or limiting factors and recommendations for improvement.  (T-1)   104  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 7 IDENTIFICATION OF REMAINS Section 7A—General Identification (ID) Policy. 7.1.  Overview.  It is the policy of the Air Force to individually segregate and identify remains of all deceased personnel to the fullest extent possible and to use all available means and scientific resources  to  accomplish  this.    No  information  concerning  identification  will  be  released  until final conclusions are established on all remains.  (T-1) 7.2.  The  ID  Process  When  Remains  Are  Recognizable.  If  the  remains  are  recognizable, presumptive identification will be established using DD Form 565,  Statement of Recognition of Deceased.    Identification  based  on  circumstantial  evidence,  such  as  wallet  contents  or  car registration  is  not  acceptable.    The  Mortuary  Officer  will  not  brief  the  PADD  on  mortuary entitlements until the remains have been positively identified.  (T-1) 7.3.  The ID Process When Remains Are Not Recognizable.  If remains are not recognizable, scientific means must be used to establish a positive ID.  Scientific identification will include the use  of  dental,  finger  or  footprint,  deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA),  or  other  scientific  means  as directed by AFMES or the agency with local jurisdiction.  If local ID support is not available, the Mortuary  Officer  will  contact  AFMAO/MA  for  ID  assistance.    The  Mortuary  Officer  will  not brief the PADD on mortuary entitlements until  the remains have been positively identified.   In the  interim,  the  PADD,  sponsor,  or  PNOK  should  be  kept  informed  daily  on  the  status  of identification.  (T-1) 7.3.1.  Remains will be officially designated as individually identified when it is concluded, with medical certainty using all identification media available, that the identification findings are in scientific agreement with an individual by name.  (T-1) 7.3.2.  Remains  will  be  officially  designated  as  unidentified  when  it  is  concluded  the scientific  identification  process  does  not  associate  those  remains  with  any  individual  by name.    NOTE:    No  remains  are  officially  designated  as  unidentified  or  unknown  unless determined by AFMES or the agency with local jurisdiction or until an Air Force mortuary specialist  makes  a  complete  review  of  the  case.    NOTE:    Unidentifiable  classification  is determined by medical examiner.  When classified as unidentifiable, the mortuary specialist will generate an AF Form 697, Identification Findings and Conclusions.  (T-1) 7.3.3.  Commingled remains that cannot be identified will never be apportioned to the known number of individuals who die in a common accident for release to the PADD.  Comingled remains that come from  a common incident, that includes 1 or more Airmen that cannot be individually  identified  will  be  buried/interred  as  a  group  in  a  common  grave  in  a  national cemetery.  (T-1) 7.3.4.  When  remains  of  United  States  armed  forces  personnel  and  remains  of  foreign personnel  are  involved  in  the  same  accident  outside  CONUS  and  identification  cannot  be promptly established, AFMES will be contacted for identification assistance. (T-1) 7.4.  ID Documentation Requirements.  Identification conclusions will be documented on: 7.4.1.  AF Form 697, Identification Findings and Conclusions.

In the event of a mass fatality incident (defined as five or more fatalities involved in a common incident): 7.5.1.  In  CONUS.    For  all  CONUS  mass  fatality  incidents,  the  Medical  Officer  from  the responding installation will notify the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP)/AFMES.  .    The  location  to  perform  the  identification  and  pathological  examinations  will  be determined jointly by AFMES in consultation with AFMAO.  (T-1) 7.5.2.  OCONUS.    Once  S&R  operations  have  been  terminated,  remains  will  be  moved promptly  to  the  Port  Mortuary,  Dover  AFB,  DE  facility  for  identification  and  pathological examinations.  Remains must not be moved before termination of S&R occurs.  The AFMES must  be  notified  of  death(s)  to  determine  death  investigation  and  autopsy  requirements.  When remains are being shipped to Port Mortuary, Dover AFB, DE each BTB remains will be  placed  in  a  transfer  case  with  sufficient  wet  ice  or  chemical  gel  packs  to  retard decomposition  during  transit.    AFMAO  Ops  Center  and  the  applicable  MAJCOM  will  be notified  of  shipment,  using  the  movement  of  remains  message  format  at  Table  3.3  Applicable records listed in Table 7.1 and all other documents generated in the processing of the remains will be shipped with the remains.

(T-1) Section 7C—The Identification Process. 7.10.  Obtaining  Records  for  Identification.  For  mishaps  requiring  investigation  (IAW  AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports), records will be collected by and are available from the  SIB.    When  deaths  do  not  require  investigation  by  the  SIB,  the  Mortuary  Officer  at  the installation responsible for recovery of the remains will: 7.10.1.  (CONUS,  including  Alaska,  Hawaii,  Guam,  Puerto  Rico,  and  US  Virgin Islands)  Obtain  necessary  records  from  the  deceased  person’s  organization  or  installation. (Table 7.1  for the list of records).  (T-1) 7.10.2.  (OCONUS)  Obtain  necessary  records  from  the  deceased  person’s  organization  or installation  for  deaths  that  do  not  require  investigation  (AFI  91-204,  Safety  Investigations and  Reports),  if  the  installation  is  in  the  same  overseas  geographical  location  where  the remains are located.  The records will be sent with the remains to the Port Mortuary, Dover AFB,  DE  for  identification  examination.    If  the  decedent’s  organization  or  installation  of assignment is in the CONUS and records cannot be readily obtained, advise AFMAO and the owning  MAJCOM  by  e-mail  when  notifying  of  shipment  of  the  unidentified  remains. AFMAO/MA  will  take  the  necessary  action  to  obtain  the  records.    The  original  applicable records,  which  include  those  listed  in  Table  7.1    and  all  other  documents  generated  in  the processing of remains, must be shipped separate from the human remains via Federal Express or  other  overnight  shipping  service  to  expedite  delivery  and  ensure  tracking  capability.  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   107  However,  one  copy  of  the  same  records  must  be  shipped  with  the  human  remains  in  a waterproof, sealed package to be placed outside the HRP, but inside the transfer case.

Military  Funeral  Honors  (MFH)  Mission.  The  Honor  Guard  is  an  installation commander or senior Air Force officer under a joint base construct program administered by the Installation Honor Guard Management  Office.  Providing dignified arrivals at destination airports  for  Air  Force  active  duty  deaths  and  military  funeral  honors  honoring  the  service  and sacrifice of our fallen Airmen is the primary mission of the base honor guard program.  The Air Force installation honor guard closest to the arrival airport receiving a fallen Airman and escort, will,  upon  receipt  of  a  supplemental  death  report  including  a  shipping  schedule,  arrange  for  a seven  (7)  person  HG  detail  to  meet  the  arrival  aircraft.    Six  (6)  of  the  personnel  will  serve  as casket  bearers  to  transfer  the  casket  from  the  aircraft  to  the  hearse  or  other  mode  of  transport, while  the  additional  person  renders  a  salute,  along  with  the  escort.    The  Air  Force  will  ensure that,  upon  request,  a  funeral  honors  detail  is  provided  for  all  eligible  recipients.    Base  honor guards  will  support  protocol  and  ceremonial  functions  for  military  and  civilians,  time  and resources  permitting.    The  military  funeral  honors  mission  takes  precedence  over  all  other ceremonial  functions.    NOTE:  At  no  time  will  an  Honor  Guard  program  manager  or  member suggest a gift is required or accept a gift for his/her support in rendering MFHs. 8.2.  MFH Entitlement.  The Air Force will provide funeral honors and a flyover (if the member is eligible) at the place of final disposition, or at a memorial service for eligible persons.  Funeral honors will  not be provided more than once.  The Honor Guard OIC or NCOIC, if performing MFH  at  a  memorial  service,  must  ensure  no  other  honors  are  going  to  be  provided  elsewhere.  The  only  authorized  support  for  an  installation  memorial  service  is  the  posting  of  the  colors.  Eligible personnel are only entitled to MFH once.  Honor Guard OICs must ensure that honors are  always  furnished  to  all  that  are  eligible.  Refer  to  Section  8C,  Military  Funeral  Honors Eligibility and Entitlements. 8.3.  Performance of MFH.  MFH will be performed either prior to or following a service held.  Ensure coordination with the Funeral Director and Cemetery Representative as to the timing of MFH  presentation.    Additionally,  ensure  the  family  has  been  consulted  and  if  they  are  not  in agreement  as  to  when  MFH  are  to  be  rendered,  every  effort  will  be  made  to  meet  the  family request. 8.4.  Composition  of  the  Funeral  Honors  Detail  Required  by  Law.  Title  10,  Section  1491, USC  stipulates  that  MFH  will  consist  of  two  (2)  or  more  persons;  this  is  also  cited  in  DODI 1300.15, Military Funeral Support.  At least two (2) members of the funeral honors detail will be members of the armed services (other than members in a retired status) at least one (1) of whom will be a member of the military service of which the decedent was a member.  The remainder of the detail  will consist  of members of the armed  forces or members of trained Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs).  VSOs support must be requested by the OIC/NCOIC of the installation honor  guard,  with  responsibility  for  performance  of  the  honors,  for  the  VSO  members  to  be entitled to the daily stipend.  Military members of the detail will wear their Ceremonial uniform while serving in the detail. AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   111  8.5.  MFH  Ceremonial  Requirements.  Title  10,  Section  1491,  USC  stipulates  a  MFH  detail will, at a minimum, include the folding and presentation of the American flag to the decedent’s family  and  the  playing  of  Taps.    Every  effort  will  be  made  to  provide  Taps  via  a  professional bugler,  military  or  civilian,  voluntary  or  contracted.    If  a  professional  bugler  is  not  available, Taps  will  be  provided  using  the  ceremonial  bugle.    If  neither  professional  musician  nor  the ceremonial  bugle  is  available,  a  high  quality  recorded  version  of  Taps  will  be  played,  if  the family has been advised.  The detail will provide the audio equipment if not otherwise available for  use  at  the  cemetery.    It  is  the  Air  Force’s  policy  to  provide  additional  honors  elements  to certain categories of personnel, as specified in Section 8C, Military Funeral Honors Eligibility and Entitlements.  Deviation from the standard honors detail sizes will only be authorized when it  is  deemed  to  be  mission  essential.  NOTE:    MFH  must  be  provided  unless  circumstances  as outlined in paragraph 8.6 Waiver of Funeral Honors or MFH have been denied in accordance with  law  and  published  Air  Force  policy  as  outlined  in  paragraph  8.8  Denial  of  Military Funeral Honors. 8.6.  Waiver  of  Funeral  Honors.  The  requirement  to  provide  honors  may  be  waived  by  the Secretary of Defense (this can be delegated to the Secretary of the Air Force) if they consider it necessary  due  to  requirements  of  war,  national  emergency  or  a  contingency  operation  or  other military requirements.  No other person or office may waive this requirement. 8.7.  Unsupported  Funeral  Honors  Requests.  It  is  not  an  option  to  not  support  a  request  for MFH, nor is it appropriate to request a funeral home or family to change the service in order to accommodate the request.  If an honor guard cannot support a detail request, they must contact other agencies for support in accordance with the MOA or in the following order if a MOA does not exist:  Local Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve units, other local active duty Air Force base  honor  guards,  other  DOD  Services  who  can  perform  MFH  (i.e.,  Army,  Navy,  Marine Corps) and their MAJCOM/A1 office to ensure the requested is supported.  An AF Form 1946, Honor Guard Checklist, must be completed indicating the circumstances and justification for the inability to support the request and submitted to AFSVA/SVORA and AFMAO/MA within five workdays.    This  information  must  also  be  recorded  in  the  Tribute  Assistance  Planning  System (TAPS, Database), https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/fhdb/owa/fhdb_main.login  within 30 days. formerly Funeral Honors known as the 8.8.

A  person  who  is  found  to  have  committed  a  Federal  capital  crime  or  a  State  capital crime, but has not been convicted of such crime by reason of such person not being available for trial due to death or flight to avoid prosecution.   112  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 8.8.4.  A  person  who  is  a  veteran,  or  who  died  while  on  active  duty  or  as  a  member  of  a Reserve component, when the circumstances surrounding the person’s death are such that to provide honors at the funeral or burial of the person would bring discredit upon the person’s Service  (or  former  Service).    If  the  Air  Force  denies  military  funeral  honors  based  on  this provision, the following actions are required: 8.8.4.1.  The  decision  to  deny  funeral  honors  rests  with  the  Secretary  of  the  Military  Department  concerned  or  their  designee  responsible  for  funeral  honors  within  each Military Service at the flag rank or Senior Executive Service level. 8.8.4.2.  The requesting family member of the deceased veteran or deceased active duty member will be provided a written explanation detailing the decision to deny honors. 8.8.4.3.  A copy of the funeral honors denial letter issued by the Military Service will be forwarded  to  the  Principal  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Personnel  and Readiness  (PDUSD(P&R)),  Attention:    Military  Funeral  Honors.  NOTE:    It  is appropriate  for  the  Mortuary  Officer  to  advise  the  PADD  of  an  active  duty  Air  Force member  or  PNOK  of  an  Air  Force  retiree/veteran,  whose  death  falls  into  any  of  the circumstances, outlined 8.8.1. – 8.8.4., of the requirement to process a package for denial of MFH, should they request MFH be rendered.  If PNOK decides not to request MFH, the AF Form 970, Statement on Disposition of Remains, will be appropriately annotated.  If the PNOK of a retiree/veteran decides not to request MFH, a memo for record will be accomplished and filed with the monthly AF Form 1946, Honor Guard Checklist. 8.8.5.  Secretary of the Air Force has delegated denial of military funeral honors authority to AF/A1. 8.8.5.1.  The  Mortuary  Officer  at  the  installation  with  cognizance  over  the  death  is responsible to: 8.8.5.1.1.

Each  calendar  year,  the  Air  Force  along  with  the  other Services,  must  submit  funeral  honors  data  for  inclusion  in  an  annual  report  to  Congress prescribed  by  law.    For  the  Air  Force  to  meet  this  requirement,  it  is  imperative  that  each  base honor  guard  team  provides  AFMAO/HG  data  on  the  number  and  cost  of  MFH  supported  for their  installation,  in  a  timely  manner.    During  the  year,  this  information  must  be  entered  into  TAPS  no  later  than  30  days  after  the  date  of  the  detail.    Timely  entry  provides  higher headquarters with information they need to respond to high level inquires on funeral honors.  It must be entered into the system no later than 15 days after the end of the calendar year. 8.10.  Responding to Funeral Honors Requests. 8.10.1.  Areas of Responsibility (AORs).  Each installation will be responsible for providing requested MFH support within the base’s AOR, identified on AFMAO Sharepoint. 8.10.2.  Communicating  With  Funeral  Director  in  their  AOR  (Program  Outreach).    Honor Guard  personnel  will  educate  funeral  directors  in  their  AOR  of  the  MFH  request  process.  Funeral directors must be made aware that: 8.10.2.1.  They  will  contact  the  base  directly  or  use  the  toll  free  number  at  1-877-MIL-HONR/ 1-877-645-4667 to request honors.  Families will not call the bases directly. 8.10.2.2.  There is a MFH CoP located at  https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/mfh/ for their use as well as the source for the most recent MFH Directory. 8.10.2.3.  Requests should typically be made as soon as possible, to prepare for the detail, with a minimum lead-time of 48 hours.  A base honor guard unit will make every effort to  prevent  non-support  of  the  request.    If  base  honor  guard  unit  cannot  support  detail, refer to paragraph 8.7   114  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 8.10.3.  Dignified  Arrival  and  Funeral  Honors  Request  Outside  the  AOR  of  the  installation where  the  death  occurred.    If  the  burial  location  is  not  within  the  AOR  of  the  installation responsible  for  providing  care  for  the  deceased,  the  Mortuary  Officer  arranging  the disposition  will  call  the Mortuary  Officer  at  the  installation  with  AOR  responsibility  at  the location  for  interment  and  notify  them  of  the  requirement  for  Dignified  Arrival  and  MFH.  The phone call will be followed-up with a Supplemental Death Message (delivery-confirmed e-mail).    When  a  military  member  dies  overseas  and  the  remains  are  returned  through AFMAO  Port  Mortuary,  Dover  AFB,  DE,  AFMAO/MA  will  notify  the  responsible installation of the requirement to provide a Dignified Arrival and MFH. 8.10.4.  Funeral Honors Requests Overseas.  Even though US law does not govern overseas locations outside the US and its territories, Air Force honor guard units overseas will attempt to respond to all requests for honors that do not impact the mission. 8.10.5.  Communications  Capabilities.    Bases  must  be  set  up  to  receive  funeral  honors requests  24  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a  week.    Bases  are  highly  encouraged  to  have  an individual answer the phone, especially after duty hours, instead of having the calls go into voicemail.  If a voicemail system is utilized, it must be monitored every 8 hours and funeral directors  must  be  contacted  as  soon  as  possible,  but  not  more  than  eight  hours  after  the request is submitted.  An on-call Honor Guard representative letter will be filed with the base command post, which will prevent loss of time to adequately schedule, task and prepare the team especially for short notice requests.

MAJCOM/A3  will  locate  and  identify  the  resource  for  the  flyover.    If  the resource is under the direction of another MAJCOM, the two MAJCOM/A3 offices will coordinate the resource(s). 8.46.1.3.  Once  the  assets  are  identified,  the  MAJCOM/A1  will  pass  the  information  to the  Mortuary  Officer  designated  to  provide  the  military  honors.    The  Mortuary  Officer will  coordinate  the  date,  time  and  place  of  the  service  with  the  flying  organization providing the resources(s). 8.46.1.4.  MAJCOM/A1  will  immediately  follow-up  with  a  notification  e-mail  to  HQ USAF/A3OO, AFMAO, the MAJCOM and unit that are providing military honors. 8.46.2.  The Mortuary Officer responsible for performing honors will submit the request for an off-base flyover through AFMAO to AF/A3OO, per guidance in paragraph 8.4.4   126  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 8.46.3.  Limitation:  Although a funeral/memorial flyover may be authorized by meeting the above criteria, it may not always be appropriate.  A funeral or memorial flyover is part of the honors bestowed on the deceased.  If the lifestyle of an individual during or following his or her military service is not within the standards normally expected of a military professional or  if  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  death  reflect  negatively  on  the  Air  Force,  a  funeral flyover may not be approved in all cases.  HQ USAF/A3O-O will make the determination in these cases. 8.47.  Memorial  Flyovers.  Procedures and approval levels  for memorial flyovers are the same as for funeral flyovers.  Memorial flyovers commemorate or recognize an individual, group, or historically significant event.   MAJCOMs may approve on-base flyovers in this category (may be delegated to Wing/CC).  For deceased members authorized a flyover per paragraphs 8.45.1 – 8.45.8    and  when  the  funeral  service  is  held  off-base,  MAJCOMs  may  authorize  an  additional memorial flyover at the base to which the individual was assigned (inform HQ USAF/A3O-O). 8.48.  Flyovers  in  the  National  Capital  Region  (NCR).  Flyovers in  the Washington  DC area are  limited  but  may  be  approved  with  certain  restrictions.    HQ  USAF/A3O-O  Aerial  Events coordinator  will  take  necessary  action  to  obtain  an  aerial  control  team  for  the  ceremony, coordinating  with  HQ  ACC/A3TA  (DSN  574-7854).    AFMAO/MA  will  make  the  appropriate arrangements for flyovers being performed in conjunction with interments in Arlington National Cemetery for eligible Airmen. 8.49.  Exceptions  to  Policy.  All requests for exceptions to policy for a flyover, for individuals not  eligible  IAW  AFI  11-209  and  paragraph  8.45  of  this  instruction,  will  be  directed  to AF/A3OO Aerial Events and processed for AF/CVA approval. Section 8F—Resource Management. 8.50.  Sources of Funeral Honors Manpower.  Performance of military funeral honors is a total force mission.  Active-duty personnel, Reserve/National Guard, and military retirees qualified by active or Reserve units honor guard personnel may also perform this mission.  However, every effort will be made to obtain volunteers for the honor guard program from active host and tenant organizations.    If  there  are  insufficient  volunteers  to  support  the  installation  honor  guard program, an organizational quota system will be required.  The Authorized Provider Partnership (AP3).      https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/mfh/ap3Links.do?tab=AP3  provides  another  source  of personnel to support the honors mission. 8.50.1.  ARC  Augmentation.    The  active  duty  installation  responsible  for  military  honors, will determine honor guard manpower requirements based on historical data collected from the AF Form 1946 and data in the TAPS for their AOR.  If there are not enough volunteers and  the  quota  system  does  not  provide  the  required  number  of  personnel  to  meet requirements,  then  ARC  augmentation  may  be  needed  to  support  the  requirement.    Further manpower information requests shall be staffed to the MAJCOM/A1 office. 8.50.2.  Authorized  Provider  Partnership  Program  (AP3).    It  allows  the  Services  to  provide more  than  the  two-person  detail  to  fold  and  present  the  flag  and  play  Taps.    Authorized providers  include  members  of  veterans’  service  organizations  (VSOs),  retirees,  Reserve Officer  Training  Corps  (ROTC)  members,  members  of  State  Military  Funeral  Honors organizations  and  other  organizations  authorized  to  participate  in  MFH.    The  AP3CoP  at AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   127  https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/mfh/ap3Links.do?tab=AP3  provides  extensive  information  on the AP3 program. 8.50.2.1.  Reimbursement.    AP3  volunteers  may  be  reimbursed  for  their  expenses  with the daily stipend.  This stipend has been annually designated by the Secretary of Defense to  defray  the  costs  for  transportation  and  other  expenses  incurred  by  the  participant  in connection  with  participation  in  the  funeral  honors  detail.    Refer  to  the  AFMAO Sharepoint  http://www.mortuary.af.mil/library/honorguard/index.asp  for  the  current memo  and  stipend  rate.    Reimbursement  for  expenses  for  members  will  come  from  the base honor guard’s O&M account.  Base honor guard units will forecast this requirement for funding. 8.50.3.  Additional elements the AP3 may provide.  AP3 can be a source of personnel for a firing detail, pallbearers, a bugler, and a color guard and may participate in the folding of the flag in veteran funeral details.  However, authorized providers cannot be a substitute for the legislated  minimum,  two-person  uniformed  member  detail  one  of  which  must  be  from  the deceased member’s branch of service to present the flag. 8.50.4.  Full-time  honor  guard  manpower  authorizations.    Authorized  full-time  honor  guard manpower authorizations may be funded through the MAJCOM POM/budget process, based on  full-time  honor  guard  workload  and  the  8G  Special  Duty  Identifier  (SDI).    Funded positions are coded under special duty identifier 8G000.  Bases have an option of converting current funded manpower authorizations into the 8G SDI for a three-year period.  After their three-year  period,  the  member  will  return  to  their  unit.    Please  consult  with  your  base Military  Personnel  Section  (MPS)  or  see  AFI  36-2101,  Classifying  Military  Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), for further instruction. 8.51.  Funding.  Authorized  funeral  honors  expenditures  are  supported  with  installation  O&M funds.  The active duty unit will budget for and provide funds for their own honors program and to cover cost of ARC and the AP3who support them.  Reimbursable expenses include: 8.51.1.  Travel  and  per  diem.    Team  members  will  be  placed  on  appropriate  travel  orders when funeral honors involve TDY. 8.51.2.  Supplies, equipment, weapons and ammunition. 8.51.3.  Procurement and cleaning of uniforms. NOTE:  ARC units fund their uniforms and if not located near an active duty installation, the ARC unit will fund uniform cleaning. 8.51.4.  Miscellaneous expenses such as hiring a bugler. 8.51.5.  In  those  instances  where  an  Installation  Honor  Guard  request  support  from  trained AP3personnel, the MFH stipend will be used for reimbursement.  The Standard Form 1164, Claim  for  Reimbursement  for  Expenditures  on  Official  Business,  will  be  used  to  request reimbursement.    The  Honor  Guard  OIC/NCOIC  of  the  supported  installation  is  responsible for processing and payment of claims.  NOTE:  Occasionally AP3 may participate in a MFH detail that requires TDY travel and/or per diem allowance.  Invitational travel orders may be issued  for  the  AP3  for  reimbursement  of  fares  or  POC  mileage,  as  well  as  actual  cost  of lodging and meals up to the per diem rate. 8.52.  Base  Honor  Guard  Uniforms.  The  USAF  Honor  Guard  establishes  base  level  honor guard  uniform  standards.    Honor  guard  uniforms  must  be  worn  and  maintained  IAW  AFI  36-  128  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 2903,  Dress  and  Personal  Appearance  of  Air  Force  Personnel,  and  the  USAF  Honor  Guard Training Manual.

Mortuary Officers or  Mortuary  Technician  cannot  direct  remains  be  moved  to  a  funeral  home  unless  the  PADD  has authorized  the  Air  Force  to  assume  custody  of  remains  for  preparation  and  movement  to  the destination designated by the PADD and there is a contact or blanket purchase agreement (BPA) established  with  the  funeral  home  stipulating  the  requirements  of  the  standards  included  in  the DoD PWS to be followed.  (T-0) 9.16.1.  For  Air  Force  activities  in  CONUS  the  Mortuary  Officer  will  arrange  for  contract mortuary  services  through  the  contracting  officer  IAW  the  Defense  Federal  Acquisition Regulation  Supplement  (DFARS)  subpart  237.70,  (48  Code  of  Federal  Regulation  (CFR) 237.7000-7004).  Contract mortuary services will be provided via an annual contract, BPA, a purchase  order  for  individual  cases  or  piggy  back  on  a  contract  awarded  to  another  service (Army or Navy).  (T-0) 9.16.2.  Every two years the mortuary office should purchase commercially published funeral home  directory  as  a  resource  to  assist  the  PADD  for  final  arrangements  of  a  fallen   136  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 airman.9.16.3.    When  selecting  a  contract  funeral  home,  ensure  potential  contract  funeral home(s) have the ability to accept GPC for payment.  (T-2) 9.17.  Annual  Mortuary  Services  Contracts  or  Blanket  Purchase  Agreement  (BPA).  Each year,  the  Mortuary  Officer  will  submit  requirements  for  mortuary  services  to  the  contracting officer in sufficient time to permit issuance of a solicitation and contract or BPA award prior to the  beginning  of  the  fiscal  year.    The  Base  Contracting  Officer  will  use  the  DoD  PWS  as  the basis for requirements for services and merchandise.   NOTE:  The GPC will be the prescribed method of payment for the services, merchandise and remains transportation expenses incurred under the BPA.  (T-1) 9.17.1.  Mortuary Offices considering the award of a contract will coordinate this action with other Air Force installations in the vicinity as well as nearby installations and activities of the other armed services, prior to issuing a solicitation.  Only one contract for mortuary services will  be  awarded  in  a  given  area  to  handle  the  remains  of  all  deceased  military  personnel, unless the local circumstances dictate the need for more than one contract.  The installation with  the  largest  potential  need  will  execute  the  contract/BPA  for  use  by  all  nearby installations  (within  an  agreed  area  of  performance).    Ensure  that  the  contract  or  BPA includes  a  clause  (CLIN  or  Letter  of  authorization  )  permitting  sister  services’  utilization.  (T-1) 9.17.2.  The  contract/BPA  will  specify  the  area  in  which  the  funeral  home  is  required  to provide mortuary services.  (T-1) 9.17.3.  Activities  having  no  contracting  authority  will  arrange  for  mortuary  services,  as required, through the nearest activity holding such authority. (Activity with contract or BPA must assume the Mortuary Officer duties.  Legally, another activity cannot use a contracting vehicle unless specifically identified in that vehicle).  (T-1) 9.17.4.  A  team  consisting  of  a  contracting  officer  as  chairperson,  Mortuary  Officer  and  a third officer designated by the Mission Support Group Commander will conduct a Pre Award Survey (PAS) to evaluate the capability and responsibility of any contractor being considered for award.  (T-1) 9.18.  One Time Purchase Order.  If an annual contract is not in effect at the place of death, a purchase order will be cut to handle the individual case.  If the contracting officer or authorized representative  cannot  immediately  go  to  the  place  where  death  occurred,  he  or  she  must telephone  (contact)  a  funeral  director  at  or  near  the  place  of  death  and  make  interim arrangements for mortuary services under this provision.  However, the contracting officer will exercise  caution  to  ensure  that  the  necessary  services  and  supplies  are  obtained  at  a  fair  and reasonable cost and performed IAW the DoD PWS.  (T-1) 9.18.1.  Where there are no contracts and the preparing funeral home will not accept the GPC or the cost is in excess of the GPC micro purchase threshold; a Form 9 must be accomplished with payment made through contracting.  (T-1) 9.18.2.  The GPC or electronic funds transfer will be used to pay primary preparation costs, using local purchase procedures.  (T-1) 9.19.  Non-Contract  Services.  In  some  cases,  recovery  and  preparation  is  accomplished  by  a non-contract funeral home before the Air Force activity is notified or learns of the death.  If the AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   137  PADD subsequently request the Air Force to assume custody of the remains and are then moved to a contract funeral home for reprocessing, dressing, casketing and shipment or delivery to final destination,  the  Mortuary  Officer  who  handles  disposition  of  the  remains  will  advise  the  non-contract funeral home to submit a claim for services rendered.  The claim, if reasonable, is paid by  that  activity.    When  you  cannot  determine  the  amount  due  the  claimant,  the  claim  will  be forwarded to AFMAO/MA for review and payment recommendation.  (T-1) Section 9E—Payment of Mortuary Supplies and Services. 9.20.  Use  of  the  Government  Purchase  Card  (GPC).  GPC will be used to pay for mortuary supplies,  equipment  and  non-personal  services  under  the  micro  purchase  threshold  ,  whenever possible.    When  there  is  a  mortuary  services  contract  or  BPA  in  effect,  with  a  pre-negotiated price of over $3,000.00, the GPC is authorized for use (AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-wide Purchase Card Program) when specified as method of payment within the contract.  (T-1) 9.20.1.  Each installation will establish a mortuary GPC account through their MAJCOM or base and coordinate with the base budget office.  GPC account is authorized for government to  vendor  purchases  for  primary  mortuary  expenses  through  a  contract  mortuary  and  as outlined in paragraphs 2.8-2.13; 2.17-2.18; and 2.21  It is prohibited to use the GPC to pay for secondary funeral expenses as listed in Table 2.1.  (T-1) 9.20.2.  Use of the GPC implies accepted financial pecuniary liability by the user.  GPC user will ensure  regulatory  specifications  (PWS) are  met (i.e., for  caskets, urns and preparation) before payment is made.  Payment will be withheld for deficiencies.  (T-1) 9.20.3.  Installations must be prompt with receipts and properly itemized invoices; misuse of the  GPC  can  lead  to  military  or  civilian  disciplinary  actions  to  include  prosecution  and removal.  (T-1) 9.21.  Payment of Mortuary Expenses. 9.21.1.  Primary Expenses - Payment made to a funeral home under contract or BPA with the Air Force.  After an initial death message has been sent, AFMAO/MA will verify the death, assign  an  authorization  number  and  send  an  authorization  letter  describing  the  entitlements specific to each case and a Cost Data Worksheet.  The Mortuary Officer will ensure correct fund citation and ESP coding for reimbursement by your MAJCOM for authorized expenses.  (T-1) 9.21.2.  Secondary and Transportation Expenses - Payment made to a receiving funeral home which is not  under contract or BPA with the Air Force.  The Mortuary Officer will ensure authorized  secondary  and  remains  transportation  expenses  are  processed  for  reimbursement upon  receipt  of  the  DD  Form  1375,  Request  for  Payment  of  Funeral  and/or  Interment Expenses,  with  an  itemized  Statement  of  Funeral  Goods  and  Services  Selected/Funeral Purchase Agreement, signed by the PADD.  A SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services  Other  than  Personal,    will  be  completed,  and  the  signed  DD  1375  and  receiving funeral home invoice will all be submitted to the FSS/RA.  The FSS/RA will process the SF 1034 against an accounting MORD or FCA (as applies IAW local guidelines) established to cover  the  mortuary  expenses.    Once  accomplished,  the  FSS/RA  will  route  the  payment package  to the local accounting and finance  office for processing and payment distribution   138  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 through  the  servicing  DFAS  office.    All  actions  will  be  accomplished  IAW  the  timelines established in paragraph 1.8.12.  (T-1) 9.21.3.  Once all purchases are complete and all reimbursement vouchers are paid, mortuary affairs  personnel  will  fax  vouchers,  GPC  expenses,  and  the  finalized/completed  cost  data worksheets to AFMAO/MA,  (302) 677-2767.  (T-1) 9.22.  Payment  of  Reimbursable  Services  and  Supplies.  The  Mortuary  Officer  at  the installation  or  mortuary  arranging  for  care  and  disposition  of  the  remains  will  accomplish  DD Form 2065, Disposition of Remains-Reimbursable Basis, and obtain supplies and transportation.  He  or  she  will  coordinate  with  the  mortuary  where  the  remains  are  prepared  to  determine  the proper amount of reimbursement to collect.  Item 14 of DD Form 2065 will be completed with the appropriate Air Force funding classification.  (T-1). NOTE:  DoD mortuary facility mortuary and embalming supplies cost list is located on AFMAO Sharepoint. 9.22.1.  Cash,  cashiers’  checks,  bank  drafts,  certified  checks  and  personal  checks  are acceptable  types  of  payment  for  mortuary  services  and  supplies.    Personal  checks  will  be annotated with the printed name, grade and organization or home address of the writer.  (T-1) 9.22.2.  In  some  instances,  there  is  no  sponsor  or  PNOK  in  the  area  to  complete  DD  Form 2065, Disposition of Remains-Reimbursable Basis.  For example, a sponsor or PNOK and his or her dependent are killed in a common accident or disaster, or the sponsor or PNOK is not in the same geographical area where the dependent died.  Make every effort locally to obtain reimbursement  even  though  a  DD  Form  2065  cannot  be  accomplished.  Promptly  advise AFMAO/MA of a case that cannot be resolved locally.  Do not hold remains outside CONUS pending resolution of reimbursement problems.  (T-1) 9.23.  Depositing  Proceeds  from  Reimbursement.  Reimbursements  collected  for  cost  of mortuary services and supplies will be immediately deposited with the servicing Accounting and Finance Office (AFO).  (T-1) 9.23.1.  The  DD  Form  1131,  Cash  Collection  Voucher,  will  be  used  to  credit  the appropriation  and  project  under  which  these  costs  were  financed  (i.e.,  D059  for  port  costs, D046 for transportation).  A copy of this form will be sent with the remains to Port Mortuary, Dover AFB, DE.  (T-1) 9.23.2.  When  the  sponsor  or  PNOK  elects  the  Port  Mortuary,  Dover  AFB,  DE  to  furnish services  and  supplies,  the  Port  Mortuary  charges  will  be  deposited  to  the  credit  of  the  Port Mortuary, Dover AFB, DE account through HQ USAF/A1S in the same manner.  (T-1) 9.24.  Establishing  Accounting  Procedures.  The  Mortuary  Officer  will  establish  accounts receivable  files,  implement  methods  of  requesting  payment  and  process  delinquent  accounts  as prescribed in DFAS-DER 177-102.  Generally, the retained copy of DD Form 2065, Disposition of Remains-Reimbursable Basis, constitutes the basis for an accounts receivable file.  AF Form 819,  Invoice/Claim,  is  used  as  a  billing  document  by  the  Air  Force  and  is  used  to  request reimbursement for mortuary services.  However, a form is very impersonal, so a transit letter will accompany  the  AF  Form  819,  Invoice/Claim.    Attach  a  copy  of  the  reimbursement  request document to DD Form 2065 in the file.  Three requests for payment are made at 30-day intervals with the second and third request sent certified mail, return-receipt requested.  Accounts not paid within  90  days  of  the  original  billing  are  sent  to  the  servicing  AFO  according  to  DFAS-DER AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   139  177.2R.

Every effort  will  be  made  to  restore  the  remains  to  a  viewable  status.    A  licensed  embalmer  will provide  a  recommended  level  of  viewability  to  the  Service  liaison  or  Air  Force  Mortuary Affairs  Specialist  that  is  assisting  the  family.    It  is  incumbent  upon  the  Service Casualty/Mortuary  Affairs  liaison  of  the  deceased,  to  ensure  the  AFMAO  viewability recommendation  is  conveyed  to  the  PADD,  PNOK,  or  sponsor.    AFMAO  will  advise  the receiving funeral home of viewability recommendation.  Every effort will be made to attain the  highest  level  of  recommended  viewability  possible.    In  the  event  of  a  discrepancy  in regards  to  the  recommended  level  of  viewability,  AFMAO  Deputy  Commander  will  make the final determination.

(T-1)   146  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 11 MASS FATALITY MANAGEMENT Section 11A—General Mass Fatality Policy 11.1.  Purpose.  This  chapter  assigns  responsibilities  and  prescribes  policy  responding  to  Mass Fatality  Incidents  (MFI).    This  chapter  will  comply  with  Air  Force  Emergency  Management publications  AFPD  10-25,  Emergency  Management;  and  AFI  10-2501,  Air  Force  Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations.  Additionally, S&R operations may be required in a MFI, refer to Chapter 6 of this publication for S&R guidance. 11.2.  Mass Fatality Incident (MFI) Defined.  A MFI is the occurrence of five or more deaths in a common incident. 11.2.1.  Mass  fatality  incidents  can  easily  cross  military  Service  boundaries  and  involve military, dependents, Department of Defense (DoD) civilians, US civilians, foreign nationals and/or non-DoD affiliated persons. 11.2.2.  Potential  scenarios  include  aircraft  mishaps,  large  vehicle  mishaps,  explosions, natural disasters, terrorist activity and armed conflict. 11.2.3.  The Force Support  Squadron Commander or  Director of the installation nearest  the incident,  or  the  commander  in  the  overseas  command  responsible  for  the  area  where  the incident occurs, will be responsible for S&R operations.  (T-1) 11.3.  Mass Fatality Operating Locations.  Depending upon the incident, mass fatality remains processing operations could be conducted in the field, a civilian facility or at the Port Mortuary, Dover  AFB,  DE.    AFMAO  has  the  capability  to  expand  for  processing  human  remains  during mass fatalities and is the preferred location for conducting mass fatality support.  If the incident occurs  outside  an  Air  Force  installation  and  local  authorities  will  not  relinquish  jurisdiction,  a plan for processing remains locally must be developed.  Mass Fatality operating locations will be managed much like the Air Force S&R capability, refer to  Chapter  6, paragraph  6.2  and 6.3  (T-1) 11.4.  Funding.  Installations  will  use  their  own  O&M  funds  to  fund  immediate  requirements and request reimbursement through their MAJCOM.  (T-1) 11.5.  Mass Fatality Management Plans.  Installations and Air Force mortuaries will develop a contingency  plan  to  support  peacetime  mass  fatality  incidents.    Installation  Mortuary  Officers will refer to Section 11E for the key elements to include in their mass fatality management plans.

Air Force and Other Services Augmentation. 11.12.1.  The  AFMAO/CC  or  Deputy  may  request  manpower  augmentation  when  the workload  justifies  additional  requirements  in  accordance  with  the  AFMAO  Mass  Fatality Plan. AFMAO will continuously evaluate manpower requirements taking into consideration 24/7 operations, projected length of operation (days, weeks), condition of remains, etc. 11.12.2.  The U.S.  Army, U.S.  Marine Corps and U.S.  Navy may provide deployed service representatives  to  support  sustained  operations  at  the  Port  Mortuary,  Dover  AFB,  DE.  AFMAO/CC or Deputy will be consulted prior to any other Service members deployment to ensure members are accounted for  appropriately.  The Services should establish MOUs with AFMAO,  as  appropriate,  to  detail  the  purpose  and  support  requirements  of  liaisons.    The liaisons  may  be  rotated  on  a  recurring  basis  as  determined  by  the  Service.    Lead  Service liaisons  may  request  augmentation  with  whatever  grade  military  or  civilian  their  respective Service deems appropriate. Section 11C—Disposition of Personal Effects. 11.13.  Handling  and  Disposition  of  Personal  Effects  (PE).  In  a  mass  fatality  incident  Air Force decedent’s PE will be recovered, identified, and disposed of per AFI 34-511. The volume of  and  commingling  of  PE  in  a  mass  fatality  incident  makes  collection  and  determination  of ownership  more  time  consuming  and  difficult  than  in  a  case  of  individual  death.    This  is  done concurrent  with  the  recovery,  identification,  and  disposition  of  the  remains  from  the  incident.  Decedent’s  PE  disposition  can  require  actions  at  multiple  locations  in  addition  to  the  mass fatality incident  site.  For instance, PE located at a decedent’s  home station (when the family does not reside there), temporary duty location, or other places under military jurisdiction must be  collected,  inventoried,  and  transferred  to  the  PERE.    Incidents  involving  large  numbers  of deceased may require the U.S. Army to establish active JPED operations at the Dover AFB, DE.  In this case each Service with deaths will provide members to the JPED to act on behalf of their Service decedents.  (T-1) 11.13.1.  Security of PE will be ensured from initial recovery to final disposition.  A secure work area (hangar, fitness  center, etc.)  is  needed for sorting property and secure storage is mandatory  (vans,  lockers,  safes,  etc.)  particularly  for  high  value  items  such  as  computers, electronics, cameras, and jewelry.  (T-1) 11.13.2.  A  Summary  Courts  Officer  (SCO)  will  be  appointed  for  each  deceased  Air  Force military member, usually from personnel assigned to the member’s home station.  The SCO is  responsible  for  collecting,  securing,  inventorying,  and  disposing  of  personal  property  of the deceased that is under military jurisdiction.  (T-0) 11.13.3.  PE retained  as  evidence.  PE may be retained as evidence by civil and/or military law enforcement or investigative authorities until no longer needed.  (T-0) AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   149  11.13.3.1.  Civil  Agencies.  Civil  law enforcement  and investigative agencies have their own  policies  and  procedures  for  disposing  of  evidence,  including  PE.    The  SCO  will advise the PERE that queries concerning PE held by non-military agencies should be sent to each applicable agency.  The SCO will provide the PERE with the agency’s physical evidence custodian’s name, mailing address, and telephone number.  (T-1) 11.13.3.2.  Military Agencies.  The SCO will contact the physical evidence custodian of the military law enforcement or investigative agency and advise the custodian when PE is released as evidence, the PE will be turned over to the SCO for disposition as prescribed by Federal statute and Air Force instructions.  (T-1) 11.13.3.3.  Air  Force  OSI,  or  Security  Forces  Investigations  (SFOI)  should  return property withdrawn for investigation purposes directly to the authorized recipient rather than the SCO.  (T-1) Section 11D—Mass Fatality Plans. 11.14.  Mass Fatality Plans – Required Elements.  Installation mass fatality plans will include the following elements: 11.14.1.  Situation Assessment.  Situation assessment considerations will include location of the  incident,  type  of  incident,  number  of  personnel  involved,  who  has  jurisdiction  over  the remains,  whether  MOUs  or  agreements  with  local  authorities  are  in  place  or  are  required.  For  incidents  that  occur  OCONUS,  Status  of  Forces  Agreements  (SOFAs)  or  other  local agreements will govern how operations are conducted. 11.14.2.  Identifying Operating Locations or Facilities.  Consider the following phases when identifying locations in the plan, keeping in mind that all phases might be handled in a single location: 11.14.2.1.  Contamination mitigation, if possible. 11.14.2.2.  Believed-to-Be (BTB) determination, if possible. 11.14.2.3.  Processing. 11.14.2.4.  Preparation location site  refrigeration, initial  processing  and reprocessing, if required. 11.14.2.5.  Handling PE. NOTE:  If it’s a joint operation, the U.S. Army  will establish or assist with a PE depot. 11.14.3.  Communications  Requirements.

Each organizational  element  on  his/her  staff  will  prepare  an  after-action  report  for  higher headquarters information and review.  (T-1) AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   151  Chapter 12 MORTUARY AFFAIRS IN CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS Section 12A—General Policy. 12.1.  Purpose.  This chapter provides policy for mortuary affairs in contingency operations and the  prescribed  processes  for  Mortuary  Affairs  Collection  Points  (MACP),  Theater  Mortuary Evacuation Points (TMEP), temporary storage or interment and handling contaminated remains.  This policy is derived from JP 4-06, Mortuary Affairs.  The US Army is the Executive Agent for Contingency  Mortuary  Operations.  Mortuary  operations  in  a  contingency  environment  will  be subject  to  host  nation  agreements  and  executed  IAW  the  American,  British,  Canadian,  and Australian  (ABCA),  QSTAG  655,  Handling  Deceased,  Personnel  in  a  Theater  of  Operations, and  NATO  STANAG  2070,  Emergency  War  Burial  Procedures,  where  applicable.  Mortuary affairs support will also be required to support any unexpected CONUS contingency operations. 12.2.  Overview.  All  Force Support  Contingency Training Sites will ensure their curriculum is reviewed  by  the  U.S.  Army  Joint  Mortuary  Affairs  Center,  Ft.  Lee,  Virginia.    The  goal  of  the mortuary  affairs  program  during  contingency  operations  is  to  ensure  remains  are  returned  to CONUS  as  quickly  as  possible  to  preserve  remains  for  identification  and  preservation  of evidence  of  death.    All  contingency  operating  locations  will  operate  under  the  Current  Death Sub-Program during regional contingencies until such time the mortuary affairs executive agent declares implementation of the Concurrent Return Sub-Program defined in paragraph 1.2.3  If it is  not  possible  to  return  remains  in  a  timely  manner,  the  theater  commander  will  implement secure temporary refrigerated storage or interment.  (T-1) 12.2.1.  War  Mobilization  Plan  (WMP)  1,  Services  Supplement,  AFH  10-247,  Volume  4, Guide  to  Services  Contingency  Planning:  Mortuary  Affairs  Search  and  Recovery(see AFMAO  Sharepoint,  and  the  Prime  RIBS  Home  Station  Readiness  Training  (HSRT)  and Force  Support  Combat  Training  (SCT)  courses  provide  additional  guidance  on  mortuary affairs in a contingency environment. 12.2.2.  Mortuary  Equipment.    Designated  lead  teams  will  deploy  with  the  initial  Mortuary Affairs  Kit  (RFSER)  to  include  human  remains  pouches,  mortuary  forms,  and  supplies  to support  limited  S&R  operations  in  the  AOR.  NOTE:    The  equipment  in  the  RFSER  kit differs  from  the  equipment  used  at  the  MACP,  which  comes  from  pre-positioned  War Reserve Materiel (WRM). 12.3.  Scope  of  the  Mortuary  Program  in  Contingency  Fatality  Operations.  The  mortuary affairs  program  in  a  contingency  environment  will  provide  support  across  the  full  spectrum  of military operations to include: 12.3.1.  S&R.    BTB  determination,  evacuation  of  remains  and  when  required,  secure temporary  refrigerated  storage  or  interment,  disinterment  and  return  of  deceased  military, civilian and allied personnel, Enemy POWs, Interned Enemy Aliens, and enemy dead.  (T-0) 12.3.1.1.  All  management wartime/contingency S&R procedures.  (T-1) and lead  UTC  personnel  will  be trained  on   152  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 12.3.2.  Establishment and operation of MACP, theater mortuary evacuation points (TMEPs), military mortuaries, and interment sites.  (T-1) 12.3.3.  Collection, inventory, storage, and processing of PE of deceased and missing US and enemy personnel IAW AFI 34-511, Disposition of Personal Property and Effects, Chapter 5, Wartime Personal Effects Office Procedures.  (T-1) 12.3.4.  Operation of the Port Mortuary, Dover AFB, DE (see Paragraph 10.2). 12.3.5.  Preparation and coordination of the shipment of remains for final disposition.  (T-1) 12.3.6.  Response to mass fatality incidents (see Chapter 11).  (T-1) 12.4.  Contingency Mortuary Support - Other Categories of Personnel. 12.4.1.  Dependents  and  US  Civilians.    Dependents  and  US  civilians  accompanying  or employed by US forces will be processed in a manner similar to US military personnel.  All records and reports required for military members will be used.  (T-0) 12.4.2.  Allied,  Interned  Enemy  Aliens  and  Enemy  Deceased.    Existing  standardization agreements will be used whenever possible.  If agreements do not exist and the US is the lead nation,  US  policy  will  have  primacy.    If  agreements  do  not  exist  and  another  nation  is  the lead, US policy would apply only to US forces and citizens, unless otherwise adopted by the multinational force. Under these circumstances the same records and reports will be used as for US military.  Interment, if required, will be separate for allied, detainees and enemy dead.  PE of allied personnel  will  be processed  IAW standing agreements or per current  mortuary affairs procedures if no agreements exist.  (T-0) 12.4.3.  Enemy POWs.  Processing of Enemy POWs will be IAW the Geneva Conventions.  (Geneva  Convention  Relative  to  the  Treatment  of  Prisoners  of  War  of  12  August  1949, Chapter IV, Section III Death of Prisoners of War, Article 120.)  (T-0) 12.4.4.  Transfer to Host Country.  When arrangements are made to transfer remains and PE to the host country or to an allied nation, the Mortuary Officers will document the transfer in the  log  of  events.    The  Mortuary  Officer  will  also  provide  information  for  all  enemy, detainees or allied deceased transferred from temporary interment sites for which they have responsibility to the Theater Joint Mortuary Affairs Office (JMAO).  (T-0) 12.5.  S&R  Operations.  While the US Army (mortuary affairs executive agent) is the lead for S&R  in  the  theater  of  operations,  bed  down  locations  with  Air  Force  base  operating  support (BOS)  responsibility  will  be  required  to  conduct  S&R  in  support  of  incidents  on/near  their installation  for  minor  incidents  with  two  or  less  casualties.    Prior  to  conducting  any  S&R operations, the Mortuary Officer must contact the Component Headquarters Services staff.  The Component  Headquarters  staff  will  coordinate  with  the  US  Army  mortuary  affairs  executive agent  to  determine  who  will  conduct  the  S&R.    When  it  has  been  determined  that  Air  Force personnel will conduct S&R operations, the following policy applies:  (T-0) 12.5.1.  S&R  will  only  be  conducted  under  conditions  that  do  not  endanger  the  S&R  team.  Under  hostile  conditions,  the  installation  or  incident  commander  will  determine  when  it  is safe to begin S&R operations. Under non-hostile conditions, EOD, CBRN (USA & USMC), FES,  EM  and  Security  Force  personnel  will  determine  if/when  the  area  is  safe  to  conduct S&R operations.  (T-1). NOTE:  In a contaminated environment, limit S&R operations to the minimum  processes  required  to  remove  remains  from  the  field.    Personnel  must  wear  the AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   153  appropriate  protective  gear  required  for  the  operation.    Treat  all  remains  as  contaminated. Consult  CE  Readiness  personnel  and  follow  appropriate  personal  decontamination procedures at the conclusion of S&R operations. 12.5.2.  Force Support personnel will manage S&R operations and work through installation leadership to task members of other organizations as augmentees.  (T-1) 12.5.3.  Units  conducting  recovery  operations  in  the  AOR  must  take  special  precautions  to preserve  all  items  that  might  be  useful  in  establishing  a  tentative  identification  of  remains.  When  performing  recovery  operations,  use  any  means  available  to  recover  all  remains  and portions  of  remains.    PE  will  not  be  removed  from  remains  at  the  mishap  site.    This  will include  official  cards  (line  badge)  and  papers,  nametags,  and  accoutrements.    These  items will be left on/with the remains to preserve identification evidence.  Only weapons, ordnance, and/or  classified  material  will  be  removed  from  the  remains.    Coordinate  with  Security Force/EOD personnel for removal.  (T-1) 12.5.4.  The Mortuary Officer will coordinate with Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE), and CE to determine personal protection equipment (PPE) requirements for S&R.  (T-2) 12.5.5.  The Mortuary Officer will coordinate with CE to determine if a GPS capability exists to plot remains and personal effects locations.  (T-2) 12.5.6.  If the recovery must be completed expeditiously, due to possible hostilities or unsafe conditions,  “R”  or  “P”  (remains/portions)  and  “E”  (personal  effects)  numbers  will  not  be used.  If there is sufficient time, the following “Tagging and Bagging” process will be used (Chapter 6).  (T-1) 12.5.6.1.  Each  stake  will  be  marked  with  an  “R”,  “P”  or  “E”  number  (example,  R-1), using consecutive recovery numbers for each stake.  (T-1) 12.5.6.2.  If  GPS  is  available  the  location  of  each  portion  of  remains  and  PE  will  be plotted.    GPS  coordinates  will  be  annotated  on  both  remains/PE  tags.  If  GPS  is  not available, hand drawn maps or sketches will be used to plot the location of remains and PE.  (T-1) 12.5.6.3.  The remains will be placed in a human remains pouch or plastic bag.  Minimize handling  to  prevent  damage.    Examine  the  ground  beneath  the  remains  and  immediate area to assure all portions are recovered.  (T-1) 12.5.6.4.  Three  tags  will  be  used  for  each  remains  (or  portion  thereof)  and  PE  found.  GPS coordinate must be written on all tags (if no GPS capability--the R, P or E-number will be written on both tags).  One tag will be attached to the remains or PE.  The second tag will be attached to the human remains/PE bag. And the third tag will be attached to the stake.  (T-1) 12.5.6.5.  Place PE found near the remains in a plastic bag and place in the same human remains pouch.  Place all other PE into a separate human remains pouch.  (T-1) 12.5.6.6.  Personal  belongings  found  loose  at  the  site  will  be  annotated  on  the  site  map and  placed  in  plastic  bags  secured  with  wire  tie  shipping  tags.    There  will  not  be  any attempt to re-associate personal property or accouterments found loose at the mishap site until the remains are processed and identified.  (T-1)   154  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 12.5.6.7.  Remains must be refrigerated at  a temperature of 34 to  40 degrees Fahrenheit or  3  to  4  degrees  Centigrade.    If  refrigeration  equipment  is  not  readily  available,  pack bagged remains in ice or ice packs in insulated chests or in a transfer case, depending on size of the remains; ice will not be placed directly on remains.  (T-1) 12.5.7.  The FSS/CC will keep the Air Force Component forward staff informed of status of recovery.  (T-1) 12.5.8.  S&R will be terminated upon direction from the installation or incident commander.  (T-1) 12.5.9.  Remains  and  PE  will  be  evacuated  as  soon  as  possible  to  the  nearest  Theater Mortuary Evacuation Point (TMEP) for onward movement to a DoD mortuary.  (T-1) Section 12B—Contingency Mortuary Operating Concept (Flow of Remains). 12.6.  Casualty Collection Point (CCP).  The CCPs are normally located near a medical facility and  managed  by  medical  personnel.    A  FSS  representative  will  normally  coordinate  with  the CCP to begin actions to receive the deceased. 12.6.1.  At the CCP, a competent medical authority is required to declare death.  Declaration of  death  will  be  recorded  on  appropriate  medical  form  or  tag.    The  word  “draft”  will  be placed on the death certificate.  During instances where remains arrive directly at the MACP, a  competent  medical  authority  will  be  called  upon  to  pronounce  death.    Physicians  in  the field  will  provide  information  on  cause  of  death,  if  known  (e.g.,  gunshot,  blunt  trauma).  Final  determination  as  to  positive  identification  of  remains  and  the  cause  and  manner  of death rests with the AFMES.  (T-1) 12.6.2.  Remains suspected to have unexploded ordnance (UXOs) must be reported to the CE representative in the Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  (T-1) 12.6.3.  While  waiting  for  transportation,  mortuary  personnel  will  ensure  remains  are  laid shoulder  to  shoulder  and  screened  to  prevent  them  from  public  view.    Mortuary  personnel will  also  coordinate  with  Security  Forces  if  needed,  to  assist  in  preventing  the  theft  of  PE, equipment, and to keep unauthorized persons away from the area.  (T-1) 12.6.4.  LRS  will  provide  FSS  mortuary  personnel  with  a  covered  vehicle  to  transport remains from the CCP to the MACP.  Remains will be carried feet first at all times.  While loading  remains,  an  attitude  of  reverence  and  respect  will  be  maintained  at  all  times.  Remains loaded on vehicles and aircraft will be loaded feet first.  Remains will be secured to prevent shifting during movement.  (T-1) 12.7.  Mortuary  Affairs  Collection  Point  (MACP).  The  MACP’s  main  purpose  is  to  move remains, along with accompanying PE, to Dover AFB, DE as quickly as possible for processing and identification (bag, tag, encase and ship). 12.7.1.  Site  Selection.    MACP  will  be  physically  separated  from  the  main  living  and working areas.  It should have natural or artificial cover (trees, hills, unused ISO containers) and be screened from view.  There should be an access  road for vehicles.  Sufficient space must be made for processing and holding areas.  A perimeter will be established to prevent unauthorized  personnel  and  news  media  from  entering  the  area.    If  there  is  a  possibility AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   155  remains  may  contain  UXOs,  provide  sandbags  and  revetments  for  emergency  areas  of protection and for general blast protection.  (T-1) 12.7.2.  Morgue Requirements.  Most field mortuary operations use a Small Shelter System to  support  MACP  operations.  The  site  will  also  require  a  275  cubic  foot  refrigerator  for remains  storage.    It  may  require  a  power  generator  if  normal  site  power  is  not  available during  processing.    MACP  will  also  require  adequate  lighting,  a  water  supply,  access  for truck  and  forklift  operations,  good  drainage  and  runoff  protection  and  ventilation.  Depending upon the location and temperatures, an environmental control unit (ECU) will be required during processing. A contaminated waste collection point will also be required.  (T-2) 12.7.3.  MACP  Layout.    Ideally,  the  receiving,  processing  and  evacuation  sections  will  be   Refer  to  JP  04-06,  Mortuary established  in  separate  areas  to  avoid  confusion. Affairs,Appendix A for detailed information on facility layout.  (T-2) 12.7.4.  MACP  Planning  for  Bio-Defense.    Because  of  the  increased  terrorist  threat  of biological warfare, planning for the operation of a MACP in a biological environment must be considered as part of the Base Support Plan.  Use of Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP)  4  equipment  meets  personnel  safety  requirements,  until  specific  Bio-Defense protective equipment/gear has been developed and fielded.  (T-2) 12.8.  Mortuary  Personnel  MACP  Responsibilities.  Mortuary  personnel  will  collect  and preserve  identification  information,  operate  the  MACP,  and  prepare  the  remains  for  shipment. Recovery  of  remains  to  either  CCP  or  MACP  will  be  accomplished  through  the  medical evacuation system or the “Buddy Care” system.  If remains are delivered to the CCP instead of the  MACP,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  MACP  or  the  mortuary  CCP  augmentees  to  collect remains  from  the  CCP  and  transport  them  to  the  MACP.    Air  Force  personnel  operating  or supporting a MACP will be trained in the utilization of the Mortuary Affairs Remains Tracking System  (MARTS).    MACP  personnel  will  upload  all  know  information  of  each  deceased  into MARTS. (T-1) 12.9.  The MACP Process.  Personnel at MACP will accomplish the tasks in paragraphs 12.9.1 through 12.9.13  However, if an aircraft is departing within two hours (or before remains can be processed), remains will be shipped without processing. (T-1) 12.9.1.  Verify  EOD  personnel  have  checked  for  UXOs  and  other  hazardous  items  prior  to entering the receiving area.  (T-1) 12.9.2.  Record  required  information  on  the  DD  Form  1077,  Collection  Point  Register  of Deceased  Personnel,  and  confirm  the  actual  number  of  remains  being  delivered.    The  DD Form 1077 is a daily log of all remains the MACP receives.  A new DD Form 1077 will be prepared each day the MACP is in operation.  (T-1) 12.9.3.  Leave clothing, personal  effects,  and  gear (i.e., helmets,  vests, safety  equipment,  or organizational equipment, including the chemical warfare defense ensemble) on the remains to  aid  in  identification  and  investigation  at  the  Port  Mortuary.    All  items  on  the  remains, except weapons, munitions, classified documents, and hazardous material, are to be shipped with the remains; do not wash remains.  (T-1)   156  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 12.9.4.  If able, unit members should remove  weapons and ammunition from their casualties prior to arrival at CCP or MACP, .  Unit members will return these items to the unit armory, aircrew  life  support  section,  or  appropriate  storage  area.    If  mortuary  personnel  discover weapons or ammunition, ensure items are secured IAW AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and the  unit  of  the  deceased  responds  as  soon  as  possible  to  account  for  the  weapons.    Always notify EOD personnel or the Emergency Operations Center if an UXO is discovered during remains processing.  (T-1) 12.9.5.  Complete  two  tags  for  every  HRP.    On  one  side  of  the  evacuation  tag  include  the remains  BTB  last  name,  first  name,  initial,  SSN  or  “unidentified”.    On  the  reverse  side, include the evacuation number, a coded sequence based on the below items: 12.9.5.1.  The  evacuation  number  IAW    will  include  a  letter  code  R,  P,  E,  D,  T,  a sequential number and year, MACP branch of service and MACP unit, and the collection point  identifier  (number  or  location).  For  example,  EVAC  #  R11-94/AR54th  QM CO/Balad.  (T-1) 12.9.5.2.  If  remains  are  fragmented,  write  the  word  “Portions”  on  tag;  beneath “Portions”,  write  the  sequential  number  of  portions  “1  of  ___”.    On  the  reverse  side include the evacuation number, as in paragraph 12.9.5.1  (T-1) 12.9.6.  Record the evacuation number, date remains were received, the BTB name and SSN, if  available,  (or  unidentified)  on  the  reverse  side  of  the  DD  Form  1077,  Collection  Point Register of Deceased Personnel.  (T-1) 12.9.7.  Place unwashed remains in HRP.  Use separate pouches for each remains and do not commingle  fragmented  remains  unless  they  were  received  commingled,  or  confirmed  to  be one  decedent.    (T-1).  NOTE:    Do  not  fingerprint  or  perform  dental  charting  in  a  field environment  as  it  may  cause  loss  of  forensic  evidence.    Dental  charting  and  fingerprinting will be performed at the Port Mortuary, Dover AFB, DE.  (T-1) 12.9.8.  Attach  one  tag  to  the  remains  and  one  tag  to  the  HRP.    When  placing  several fragmented remains, each portion must be tagged.  HRP must also have an evacuation tag on which the words “Portions” is written and beneath it the total number of portions contained in the HRP.  The reverse side is completed as in paragraph 12.9.5  (T-1) 12.9.9.  Place the plastic pouch with the death certificate and other pertinent information into the remains pouch.  Close and secure the remains pouch with a plastic fastener.  (T-1) 12.9.10.  Coordinate with Security Forces if assistance is required to guard remains until they are  shipped  to  either  a  TMEP,  OCONUS  mortuary  or  the  Port  Mortuary,  Dover  AFB,  DE.  (T-1) 12.9.11.  When remains are ready to be shipped, place them into a transfer case and put ice around the pouch.  Ensure the ice does not come in direct contact with the remains.  Place the plastic  bag  with  the  death  certificate  and  other  pertinent  information  in  the  transfer  case document  sleeve,  or  tape  to  the  top  of  the  transfer  case.    The  transfer  cases  will  be  draped with a flag from the AOR to the Port Mortuary, if the deceased are US personnel.  (T-1) 12.9.12.  Record the shipment information  (date,  shipped to) on DD  Form 1077, Collection Point Register of Deceased Personnel.  Also record the shipment on DD Form 1075, Convoy AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   157  List of Remains of Deceased Personnel.  The aircraft commander or vehicle driver must sign for the remains on DD Form 1075.  (T-1) 12.9.13.  At  the  end  of  each  day,  the  FSS  Unit  Control  Center  (UCC)  will  provide  higher headquarters  with  a  SITREP  of  the  day’s  mortuary  affairs  activity.    Record  all  evacuation numbers  received  and  shipped  on  the  report.    Continue  reporting  these  numbers  on  future SITREPs  until  notification  of  the  remains  have  arrived  at  Port  Mortuary,  Dover  AFB,  DE.  Continue  reporting  during  emergency  conditions,  delayed  precedence.    Submit  data requirements  as  prescribed,  but  they  may  be  delayed  to  allow  the  submission  of  higher precedence reports.  (T-1) 12.10.  Theater  Mortuary  Evacuation  Points  (TMEPs).  TMEPs  are  established  to  evacuate all remains and accompanying PE to a DoD mortuary.  Personnel at the TMEP will: 12.10.1.  Receive  remains  (and  accompanying  PE,  clothing  and  gear)  from  any  theater location  and  record  them  on  the  DD  Form  1077,  Collection  Point  Register  of  Deceased Personnel.  (T-1) 12.10.2.  Perform  quality  assurance  checks  on  existing  documentation  and/or  initiate complete and obtain required processing documentation.  (T-1) 12.10.3.  Prepare  remains  for  evacuation  and/or  ice  the  remains,  when  practical  until transportation can be arranged.  (T-1). NOTE:  Do not remove equipment, wash the remains, clean the fingers for fingerprinting or fingerprint the remains.  (T-1) 12.10.4.  Arrange  airlift  and  initiate  all  required  shipping  and  special  handling  documents. (T-1) 12.10.5.  Record  the  shipment  on  DD  Form  1075,  Convoy  List  of  Remains  of  Deceased Personnel.  (T-1) 12.10.6.  Transport  transfer  cases  to  the  AMC  special  handling  area  to  be  palletized.  Transfer cases will be tied down with three transfer cases per pallet.  If absolutely necessary, you may place cases in three rows, each row stacked to a maximum of four.  (T-0). NOTE:  Transfer cases will be loaded onto the aircraft feet first and turned once inside the aircraft so the remains are stowed in the aircraft head first towards the nose of the aircraft.  Ensure the head is higher than the feet.  This will normally be accomplished by stowing the case on the aircraft  or  pallet  in  a  level  position.    No  other  cargo  or  miscellaneous  items  besides  other human remains will be placed on top of human remains.  Remains should be offloaded feet first,  (AMCI  24-101  V11).    Transfer  cases  will  be  flag  draped,  per  Paragraph  12.9.11    If stacked, cases will not be draped with the US flag.  (T-1) 12.10.7.  Document evacuation numbers in the SITREP.  (T-1) 12.10.8.  If  remains  arrive  at  the  TMEP  and  have  not  been  loaded  into  MARTS,  TMEP personnel will ensure this is accomplished before the remains are transferred from the TMEP.  (T-1) 12.11.  Aerial Port:  (Force Support Augmentation). 12.11.1.  Aerial  port  will  receive  remains  from  the  TMEP,  record  them  on  DD  Form  1077, Collection Point Register of Deceased Personnel, and ice remains for shipment if practical.

Section 12C—Temporary Storage or Interment in the AOR. 12.13.  Emergency Interment.  Emergency interment is an interment, usually on the battlefield, when conditions do not permit either evacuation to a MACP or TMEP.  Sometimes referred to as hasty burial, it may occur when intense hostilities prevent evacuation of remains and burial is an emergency means of preserving  remains or preventing them from  falling  into enemy hands.   It may amount to little more than hiding and recording the location of remains so they can be safely recovered later.  It is the only situation in which temporary interment can occur without theater commander direction.  In such case, the decision to temporarily inter can be made by the senior military  member  (officer  or  enlisted)  on  scene.    If  so,  immediately  meet  with  CE  to  finalize layout and begin excavating a temporary interment site.  It is imperative to record the location of the emergency burial so that the remains can be found and disinterred as soon as possible.  (T-1) 12.14.  Temporary  Interment.  Temporary  interment  is  only  permitted  as  a  last  resort.    Every effort  will  be  made  to  evacuate  remains  as  soon  as  possible.    Situations  that  may  require temporary interment include weapons of mass destruction, hostilities, transportation shortages, a large number of remains that could overwhelm manpower capabilities, insufficient capability to decontaminate  remains  or  insufficient  refrigerator  space.    Unit  commanders  must  obtain permission  from  the  geographic  combatant  commander  to  conduct  temporary  interment operations.  (T-1) 12.14.1.  When  circumstances  warrant  temporary  interment,  recovery  operations  will  be conducted as soon as possible.  (T-1) 12.14.2.  When interment is required separate interment sites will be established for burial of allied,  detainees  and  enemy  deceased  to  aid  in  later  disinterment  operations.  When arrangements  are  made  to  transfer  remains  to  the  host  country  or  to  a  friendly  nation, commanders  will  maintain  records  of  the  transfer  and  provide  information  for  all  allied, detained or enemy deceased transferred from temporary interment sites for which they have responsibility.  (T-1) 12.15.  Selection  of Temporary Interment Site.  The site will be level, free of large obstacles, away from main roads and populated areas, not in a flood zone and have adequate soil depth to AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   159  the water table.  CE will determine what equipment is available on station that will be adequate to the task given types of soil and local conditions.  Ensure the layout is site specific and they do not try using strictly book values for spacing and depth.  CE must provide enough space between rows to prevent equipment from caving in or sliding into the trenches when excavating and while covering  the  remains.    They  may  also  have  to  assist  FSS  personnel  for  placement  of  row markers.    At  established/mature  contingency  bed  downs,  the  location  of  temporary  burial  sites will be determined in advance.  Primary and alternate sites for temporary burial locations will be clearly identified using grid coordinates.  Site selection will be coordinated between CE and FSS.  (T-1) 12.15.1.  Interment  Site  Dimensions.    Temporary  burial  sites  do  not  contain  individual graves,  but  will  consist  of  straight  rows  (trenches).    The  number  of  remains  you  have  will determine how many sites you will need.  No more than 10 remains, head to foot lengthwise, will be placed in each trench. The rows will be 70 feet long, 3 ½ feet deep and 3 feet wide.  For contaminated remains, the depth will be 6 1/2 feet and trenches will be 80 feet long.  A distance of 3 feet between trench rows will be maintained.  Base CE will provide mechanical trenching or other earth moving equipment, with operators.  Separate rows will be used for US, allied, and enemy dead.  (T-1) 12.16.  The Temporary Interment Process.  Mortuary personnel will: 12.16.1.  Meet personnel transporting remains and obtain documentation and information on the  remains.    If  a  list  of  remains  is  present,  remains  will  be  verified  as  they  are  offloaded.  Upon verification, mortuary personnel will sign for remains.  (T-1) 12.16.2.  Initiate the DD Form 1079, Interment/Disinterment Register.  (T-1) 12.16.3.  Report remains suspected to have UXOs to the EOC.  (T-1) 12.16.4.  Leave clothing, gear (including helmets, vests, safety equipment, or organizational equipment)  and  personal  effects  on  remains  to  aid  in  identification  at  the  port  mortuary  to include  the  chemical  warfare  defense  (CWD)  suit.    All  items  on  the  remains,  except weapons, munitions, classified documents, and hazardous material, are to be shipped with the remains.  (T-1) 12.16.5.  Assign each remains an interment  processing number by using  the next  sequential number from the DD Form 1079, Interment/Disinterment Register, Block 5.  Use one page of DD Form 1079 for each row of 10 remains.  The number consists of an accumulative number and the current calendar year, e.g., 03-0024-2015 (row 3, remains number 24, calendar year 2015).  (T-1) 12.16.6.  Record  information  (interment  processing  number,  date  received  and  BTB  name and SSN, if available) on DD Form 1079, Interment/Disinterment Register.  (T-1) 12.16.7.  Place remains in a human remains pouch (HRP); when HRPs are not available, they will  be  wrapped  in  a  poncho  or  plastic.    Two  tags  will  be  completed  (use  metal  tags  if available),  each  with  the  interment  processing  number.    Tags  will  be  attached  as  follows:  One to the remains and one to the HRP.  (T-1). NOTE:  If remains are fragmented, attach a tag  to  each  portion  of  the  remains  recovered.  Use  the  evacuation  number  to  identify  each portion of commingled remains believed to be the same. “R” or “P” numbers, as those used   160  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 in S&R, are not needed for identification, they are only used in charting an accident site.  (T-1). NOTE:  If time allows: 12.16.7.1.  Establish BTB ID or use unidentified.  (T-1) 12.16.7.2.  Place  the  plastic  pouch  with  DD  Form  2064,  Certificate  of  Death  Overseas, and other information in the HRP. Close the remains pouch.  (T-1) 12.16.8.  Remains will be placed head to foot.  (T-1) 12.16.9.  PE will be buried with remains of US personnel.  (T-1) 12.16.10.  DD Form 1079, Interment/Disinterment Register, will be provided to the Theater Joint  Mortuary  Affairs  Office  (JMAO).The  Mortuary  Officer  will  retain  a  copy  of  the  DD Form 1079 in the mortuary case file and forward a copy to AFMAO.  (T-1) 12.17.  Marking the Temporary Interment Site.  To mark the site, a stake will be placed at the beginning  (head)  and  end  of  each  row.    The  marker  will  extend  at  least  three  feet  above  the ground.  Attach a weather resistant sign to the stake bearing the following information:  number of  remains  and  date  of  burials.    CE  will  provide  interment  site  coordinates  using  GPS,  if available.  Determine  the  location  of  each  row  and  record  it  on  the  DD  Form  1079, Interment/Disinterment  Register.    (T-1).  NOTE:    If  remains  are  contaminated,  ensure  the  area has been clearly marked by CE Readiness. (T-1) 12.18.  Disinterments.  Remains temporarily interred will be disinterred  at  the earliest possible time.  Remains should be recoverable at a future date and returned to Port Mortuary, Dover AFB, DE for processing or to  an interment site as directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and/or Joint Staff.  AFMES is responsible to determine when remains are safe to repatriate.  The on-scene  commander  is  responsible  for  planning  the  opening  of  trench  graves  to  ensure accountability  of  remains  using  DD  Form  1079,  Interment/Disinterment  Register.    Whenever personnel  are  conducting  disinterment  operations  they  will  wear  PPE,  such  as  surgical  masks, gloves,  aprons,  and  other  types  IAW  OSHA  standards.    (T-1).  NOTE:    If  remains  were contaminated,  ensure  proper  re-supply  of  PPE  and  protective  clothing  is  available  for  MACP personnel and worn as required.  (T-1) 12.18.1.  Once in the general area of the site, GPS, in conjunction with maps, will be used to determine  the  exact  location  of  each  row.    Attempt  to  locate  the  markers  that  should  have been placed at the beginning (head) of each row.  (T-1) 12.18.2.  The row may be opened from either end.  Using a backhoe  and digging with care, the  operator  will  dig  down  approximately  one  and  one  half  feet.    Multiple  rows  may  be opened  simultaneously  depending  on  available  equipment.    Remaining  depth  will  be  dug with hand tools so as not to mutilate the remains.  Carefully remove dirt from all sides of the remains.  Look for the tag attached to the outside of the HRP or shroud.  (T-1) 12.18.3.  Match  the  number  on  the  tag  to  the  DD  Form  1079,  Interment/Disinterment Register,  processing number recorded during interment operations.  (T-1) 12.18.4.  If required, place the disinterred remains and HRP in a new HRP.  (T-1) 12.18.5.  If the HRP or shroud was not intact, the soil in the immediate area will be sifted for skeletal anatomy and PE.  (T-1) AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   161  12.18.6.  Complete  the  DD  Form  1079,  Interment/Disinterment  Register,  and  prepare processing tag in the same manner as in interment operations.  Attach this tag to the shroud or HRP.  (T-1) 12.18.7.  Place remains and HRP on a litter and remove them from the row or interment site.  (T-1) 12.18.8.  Evacuate  the  remains  to  the  MACP  for  processing  and  further  evacuation  to  the TMEP. (T-1) 12.18.9.  After  disinterment,  the  land  will  be  restored  to  its  original  condition  to  the  best possible extent.  (T-1) 12.18.10.  Report  recovery  through  command  channels  to  the  Theater  JMAO  when  all remains have been disinterred.  (T-1) Section 12D—Contaminated Remains. 12.19.  Contaminated  Remains  Overview.  This  section  provides  instructions  for  handling contaminated  human  remains  and  the  precautions  to  take  to  protect  personnel  involved  in recovering and processing those remains.  This instruction and Joint Pub 4-06,Mortuary Affairs in  Joint  Operations  are  not  meant  to  replace  the  involvement  of  Chemical,  Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) experts in the decontamination process. 12.19.1.  If  remains  are  contaminated  with  CBRN  agents,  all  efforts  will  be  made  to decontaminate  them  and  return  them  through  routine  channels.    The  US  Army,  as  the Executive  Agent  for  Mortuary  Affairs,  has  dedicated  decontamination  teams  and  is responsible to respond to all contamination events.  They are responsible for decontamination and  certification  of  remains  as  decontaminated  prior  to  transport  out  of  the  AOR  or OCONUS.    For  remains  that  cannot  be  decontaminated,  protecting  the  health  of  service members  and  the  public  must  take  precedence  over  the  rapid  repatriation  of  remains.  Temporary  refrigerated  storage  or  interment  of  those  contaminated  remains  still  posing  a threat  to  public  health  is  the  recommended  method  of  disposition,  until  safe  handling procedures and materials can be identified for temporary interment policy, paragraphs 12.14  through 12.18).  (T-1) 12.19.2.  At the time of recovery, trained CBRN personnel (within the AF EM personnel are CBRN responders) or other specifically trained function (e.g. FES, EOD) will determine if a CBRN hazard exists and recommend appropriate PPE.   If the hazard cannot  be determined on an individual basis, all remains in the affected area will be treated as contaminated.  (T-1) 12.20.  Handling  Contaminated  Remains.  Currently,  Air  Force  role  in  this  process  is  to perform  temporary  refrigerated  storage  or  interment  of  remains,  if  it  has  been  determined remains  cannot  be  decontaminated.    The  Geographic  Commander  is  the  only  authority  to authorize or direct temporary interment.  (T-1) 12.20.1.  FSS representatives in the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) will request Army mortuary affairs decontamination team support from the theater forward headquarters and/or approval for temporary storage or interment.  (T-1) 12.20.2.  The  Unit  Control  Center  (UCC)  will  be  informed  that  the  handling  operation  for (chemically/biologically)  contaminated  remains  is  about  to  commence.    Final  approval  will   162  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 be  requested  before  beginning  this  operation.    Follow  UCC  instructions  in  the  event  they direct  alternative  actions  be  taken.    If  the  mortuary  affairs  or  CBRN  reconnaissance  team members  are  uncertain  as  to  whether  or  not  remains  have  been  chemically  contaminated, treat them as if they are.  (T-1) 12.20.3.  In  the  event  the  Army  cannot  decontaminate  remains  or  they  cannot  respond  in  a timely manner, FSS personnel will follow the process in Table 12.1  (T-1) 12.20.4.  If remains are identified, AFMAO will contact the PADD and inform them remains must remain in-theater due to contamination.  (T-1) 12.20.5.  Remains will be recoverable at a future date and returned to Port Mortuary, Dover AFB, DE for processing or to an interment site as directed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and/or Joint Staff.  (T-1) 12.21.  Contaminated  Personal  Effects.  Return  of  contaminated  PE  to  the  family  is  not guaranteed.  In  instances  where  the  PE  are  contaminated  and  there  is  no  effective  way  to decontaminate the substance (paper for example), these effects will be interred with the remains and the family informed of the situation by AFMAO mortuary staff.  (T-1) AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   163   Table 12.1.  Contaminated Remains Handling  1.  If remains cannot be decontaminated and approval has been obtained, the team chief will confirm with the Bioenvironmental Engineer in the EOC who will recommend appropriate PPE.  Mortuary personnel, in appropriate PPE or MOPP 4, will examine remains for the presence of any weapons, ammunition or UXOs.  Remains suspected to have UXOs must be reported to the CE representative in the EOC.  Contaminated weapons will be double bagged and marked with contaminant information. 2.   Check the ensemble for BTB information and follow usual tag composition procedures – BTB name information, SSN and if transporting remains to the Mortuary Affairs Decontamination Collection Point (MADCP), the evacuation number.  3.  If medical personnel have not arrived, contact UCC about need to complete DD Form 2064 or other appropriate medical forms.  Place all paperwork in sealed bag and place in inner HRP.  4.   Properly mark remains.  Use the appropriate CBRN marking kit signs for inside and outside of the HRP if available.  If marking kits are not available, place the letter “C” on the BTB information tags, to identify CBRN contamination.  An adhesive “GAS” sticker or “Gas” sign with the suspected type of chemical agent used or affix a BIO marker from the marking kits for the type of suspected BIO agent the remains were exposed to if known.  Attach one tag to the remains, one to the HRP, and complete DD Form 1077.  5.   Double-pouch remains.  First, place remains into HRP, leaving clothing, gear (including helmets, vests, safety equipment or organizational equipment, including the chemical warfare defense ensemble) and PE on remains to aid in identification at the Port Mortuary .  All items on the remains, except weapons, munitions, classified documents and hazardous material, are to be shipped with the remains.  Then, place the first HRP into another HRP.  HRPs will be contained in either sealed refrigerators or temporarily interred until Army decontamination units can attempt decontamination. Chemical, biological and radiological remains may need to be stored separately by contaminating agent.  Biologically contaminated remains should be segregated as non-contagious pathogen, contagious pathogen or toxin.  If remains cannot be decontaminated, consult the Office of Armed Forces Medical Examiner (AFME) or medical representative regarding obtaining a DNA specimen prior to temporary interment.  Personnel collecting DNA specimen should be in MOPP4 if remains have not been decontaminated.  6.   Notify AFMAO, through the Component headquarters Services staff that remains cannot be decontaminated and will be temporarily interred.  See paragraphs 12.14. through 12.17.  for temporary interment instructions.  AFMAO will contact AFMES and request they obtain a DNA specimen of remains.  If temporary interment is necessary, CE will assist in site selection and site preparation. Contaminated remains must be buried 6 ½ feet deep.  7.  8.   Temporary graves will be marked and 24-hour security provided.   9.   Accurately address the number and status of contaminated remains within daily SITREPs.  10.   Personnel collecting DNA specimen will be in MOPP 4 if remains have not been decontaminated.     164  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 12.22.  Health and Safety.  Safety is a major concern in all operations.  Leaders must be aware of safety-related factors involving remains handling and ensure Operational Risk Management is integrated  into  processes  and  operations.    Sanitation  of  the  morgue  and  personnel  should  be constantly monitored.  (T-1) 12.22.1.  Sanitation.    Gloves  and  ensemble  will  be  decontaminated  with  M295  kits,  M291 kits  and/or  5%  chlorine  solution  after  handling  contaminated  remains  or  articles  and  then rinsed  in  clear  water  solution.    To  minimize  possible  transfer  hazards,  mortuary  affairs personnel  must  be  aware  of  symptoms  of  early  exposure  that  would  indicate  cross contamination  from  remains  or PE.   If not  already known, obtain this information  from  the CE representative in the EOC.  (T-1). NOTE:  In case of biological attack, these symptoms may not show up for hours, days or even weeks due to toxins or pathogens.  In the event of cross  contamination,  immediately  take  appropriate  self-aid/buddy  care  (SABC)  actions  and report  the  onset  of  any  of  these  symptoms  to  the  mortuary  team  leader,  and  in  case  of biological  exposure,  contact    the  medical  treatment  center  for  further  instructions.    The morgue will be disinfected daily or as needed, by mopping the floor and wiping down tables with hot water and cleaning solutions.  (T-1) 12.22.2.  Heat Stress.  Heat stress is a vital aspect when working in the morgue.  Supervisors must watch for signs of heat injury as discussed in AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual.  (T-1) 12.22.3.  Work  and  Rest  Cycles.    Once  personnel  reach  their  maximum  workload  for  heat stress, they cannot recover quickly enough to accomplish the mortuary mission.  (T-1) 12.22.4.  Lifting  Requirements.    Personnel  must  follow  proper  lifting  techniques  when moving remains.  Each individual will not lift more than 75 pounds.  They will be instructed on how to lift with their legs, not their back.  Use a back-belt when strenuous lifting occurs.  (T-1) 12.22.5.  Blood-Borne  Pathogens.    During  the  handling  of  remains,  care  is  taken  to  avoid exposure to blood or body fluids.  Rubber gloves, aprons, surgical masks, and eye protection must  be  worn  when  working  with  remains.    If  contact  is  made,  wash  the  area  immediately with disinfectant or soap solution.  (T-1)  Table 12.2.  Decontamination Supplies and Equipment  Equipment  M8 paper  M295 Kit  M291 Kit  Industrial/medical scissors (high strength, sharp)  CBRN Marking Kit  Adhesive “GAS” markers  CBW rubber gloves (5 small, 5 medium, 5 large)  Undiluted bleach (or equivalent 5% chlorine solution)  Containers (buckets) for hand decontamination and rinse operations  Container (barrel) for temporary storage of used protective masks  Hazardous Waste Bags   Minimum Required  10 Books  10 Each  10 Each  Two (2) Pair  One (1) Kit  25 Sheets  15 Pair  25 Gallons  5  1  100 Each  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   165  BIO and GAS Stickers  Boxes of plastic bags  100 Each  200 Bags  12.22.6.  Exposure  Symptoms  Awareness.    Mortuary  affairs  personnel  must  be  aware  of symptoms  of  early  exposure  to  CBRN  contaminants  and  Explosive  Hazards  (EH)  and  the steps needed to mitigate their exposure (AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual).  (T-1) 12.22.7.  Control/Disposal  of  Contaminated  Waste.    CBRN  attacks  can  generate  significant quantities of contaminated waste.  Contaminated items could include PPE and field gear, M8 and  M9  paper,  components  of  the  M291  and  M295  decontamination  kits,  contamination avoidance covers and bulk plastics, and personal equipment.  Mortuary personnel will collect contaminated items,  double wrap, mark as contaminated, and store-contaminated items  in  a closed  container.    CE  Readiness  personnel  will  determine  if  they  can  be  reused.    Do  not automatically dispose of any items.  FSS will work with CE to develop specific procedures for handling and disposing of contaminated waste as part of their Base Support plans.  (T-1) 12.22.8.  Briefings.    Personnel  involved  in  contingency  mortuary  operations  must  receive intervention from the DMH Team  IAW AFI 44-153, Disaster Mental Health Response and Combat and Operational Stress Control,  prior to returning to their regular duties.  (T-1) 12.23.  Required  Supplies  and  Equipment.  To  prevent  contamination  of  personnel  during limited  handling  and  movement  of  contaminated  remains,  the  MACP  will  have  as  a  minimum the  amounts  and  types  of  CBRN  defense  equipment  in  Table  12.2.    Additional  MOPP  4  outer garments may be required for the handling and processing of contaminated remains and for S&R operations.    With  the  increased  terrorist  threat,  MOPP  4  protective  gear  will  need  to  be  made available for MACP and S&R operations at home station as part of the installation Bio-Defense Base Plan.  (T-1)   166  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 13 FAMILY ASSISTANCE REPRESENTATIVE FOR FAMILIES OF DECEASED AIRMEN 13.1.  Introduction 13.1.1.  Introduction.  The Family Assistance Representative (FAR) is part of a greater team that  assembles  to  provide  maximum  support  and  assistance  to  a  family  who  has  lost  an Airman.  His or her primary role is to be a facilitator of support between the Air Force and the family, acting as a liaison to seek subject matter experts (SMEs) to address family needs that  may  include  resources,  services  or  information.    They  are  a  trusted  and  compassionate military presence at a very devastating time in a family’s lives. 13.1.2.  Philosophy.    The  FAR  is  based  upon  the  three  tenets:  Care,  Service,  and  Support.  Care for families begins with empathy and extends to ensuring that the physical, emotional, and  spiritual  needs  of  families  are  attended  to,  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.    Service  is ensuring the coordination of suitable resources for the greatest effect in  assisting individual families, without substituting as subject matter expert.  Support incorporates care and service, and adds compassion, empathy and sustenance to all assistance delivered. 13.2.  Key Personnel In The Delivery Of Services 13.2.1.  Air  Force  Mortuary  Affairs  Operations/Mortuary  Affairs  Division  (AFMAO/MA).  AFMAO  provides  guidance,  consultation  and  training  products  to  installation  Mortuary Officers who have mortuary affairs mission execution responsibilities.  (T-1) 13.2.1.1.  AFMAO  assists  in  all  situations  requiring  multiple  FAR  assignments  where assistance is needed from installations other than the home station of the fallen Airman.  (T-1) 13.2.2.  Installation  Commander.    The  installation  commander,  or  senior  Air  Force  officer within the joint base organizational structure, who will act as the installation commander for the  purposes  of  mortuary  affairs  in  this  chapter,  will  ensure  that  a  FAR  is  assigned  in  all cases  that  originate  within  a  unit  located  on  their  installation,  to  include  tenant  units  and detachments.  (T-1) 13.2.3.  Home  Station  Unit  Commander.    The  unit  commander  of  a  fallen  Airman  chooses and recommends to the installation Mortuary Officer  the name of a unit member selected to serve  as  the  FAR,  and  ensures  that  individual  is placed  on  TDY  orders,  as  necessary.    The primary  concern  for  the  unit  commander  is  to  ensure  that  the  assigned  FAR  is  emotionally and  mentally  mature  enough  to  assist  the  family,  and  meets  the  criteria  outlined  in paragraphs 13.3.4 through  13.3.7  (T-1) 13.2.4.  Family Assistance Representative (FAR).  The FAR is assigned to assist the PADD and the PNOK of an active duty Airman.  He or she will reach out to subject-matter-experts (SMEs) who will correspond directly with the family member to respond to their questions or concerns.  The FAR’s primary responsibility is to help insure the family’s immediate needs are met by identifying resources available for their individual circumstances.  (T-1) AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   167  13.2.5.  Installation Mortuary Officer.  The Mortuary Officer is responsible for accepting the unit commander’s recommended FAR, and generating that individual’s special appointment orders.  The Mortuary Officer, or designee, will ensure the requisite training is provided and ensure  background  regarding  the  deceased’s  information  and  family  construct/dynamics,  is provided prior to the FAR being introduced to the family to which they have been assigned to assist.  The Mortuary Officer is also responsible for providing assistance and supervision to the FAR for the duration of his or her assignment.  (T-1) 13.2.5.1.  The  Mortuary  Officer,  or  designee,  will  ensure  the  FAR  is  provided  with  a folder of printed materials designed to assist him or her with FAR duties: a copy of this chapter, including all attachments; the FAR Quick Reference Guide, and a FAR Brochure that  is  to  be  given  to  the  assigned  family.    These  resources  can  be  found  on  AFMAO Sharepoint.  (T-1) 13.2.5.2.  The  Mortuary  Officer  will  send  a  Completion  of  Family  Assistance Representative  Duties  letter  to  the  PNOK/PADD  supported  by  the  appointed  FAR.  Letter and training products can be found on AFMAO Sharepoint.  (T-1) 13.2.6.  Installation  Mortuary  Affairs  Technician.    The  Mortuary  Tech  assists  the  Mortuary Officer in the execution of his/her duties, and will execute duties as assigned with regard to FAR appointment and training.  The Mortuary Tech creates the deceased’s mortuary case file and will ensure the FAR log of events is included when closed out.  (T-1) 13.2.7.  Casualty Assistance Representative (CAR).  Executes his or her duties in accordance with  AFI  36-3002,  Casualty  Services,  and  will  be  available  to  the  FAR  should  the  family have  questions  regarding  casualty  benefits  and  entitlements.    When  possible,  the  FAR  will partner with the CAR to support the PADD/PNOK as a team.  (T-1) 13.2.8.  Military Support Agencies.  There are many different support agencies that exist on any  given  installation  and  within  local  communities.    The  FAR  should  have  a  working knowledge of  the role of those agencies  at  his  or her installation.  Some  examples of these organizations include the Mental Health Clinic, Chaplains Corp, and the Airman and Family Readiness Center.  (T-1) 13.3.  Air Force Family Assistance Representative (FAR) Program Service Delivery 13.3.1.  Program overview.  The FAR  is  a key conduit for interactions between the Person Authorized  to  Direct  Disposition  (PADD)  of  a  deceased  Airman  and  any  agencies  or organizations with which the family needs assistance.  The primary concern for a FAR is the well-being of the family to which they have been assigned.  NOTE:  If the PADD is not the PNOK, then a second FAR may be appointed.  (T-1) 13.3.2.  Persons eligible to be assigned a FAR.  All family members who are eligible to receive benefits or entitlements, as a result of the loss of an Airman, are eligible to be supported by a FAR.  However, efforts will be made to assign only one FAR, as the intention of the FAR program is to provide continuity of information.  Multiple FARs assigned can result in unintended complications and confusion as a result of increased communication conduits.   (T-1) 13.3.3.  When to appoint a FAR.  Appoint a FAR to the PADD/PNOK for Airmen who are eligible IAW Section 2 of this instruction.  (T-1)   168  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 13.3.4.  Selecting a FAR.  The overarching consideration for selecting a FAR will be on the basis of the individual’s maturity and capacity to assist the family of a fallen Airman.  It is highly recommended that caution be exercised in assigning a FAR who has close ties to the deceased member or their family, due to the possibility that they may also be traumatized by the death  of the Airman, which can impede their ability to  perform  FAR duties effectively.  Leadership is  responsible for ensuring that the  FAR is watched  closely for burn out  or any other  signs  of  mental  or  emotional  deterioration.    Guidelines  and  considerations  for  FAR selection: 13.3.4.1.  Rank  or  civilian  grade.    Where  practical,  and  at  the  discretion  of  the  unit commander,  the  FAR  should  hold  the  rank  of  E-7or  higher  for  enlisted  personnel;  an officer of equal  or greater rank for commissioned personnel.    In the rare instance that a DoD  civilian  would  perform  these  duties,  their  grade  should  be  commensurate  with  or greater than that of the deceased member.  (T-1) 13.3.4.2.  Availability.    Appointed  personnel  will  be  released  from  regular  mission responsibilities  in  order  to  perform  FAR  duties  full-time.    FARs  often  assists  families outside  normal  business  hours  and  should  be  able  to  make  the  appropriate  time commitment.  Any personnel considered to serve as a FAR should not be scheduled for leave, deployment, TDY or PCS move.  (T-1) 13.3.4.3.  Career field.  Whenever possible, the FAR will hold the same AFSC and type of  job  as  the  deceased  Airman.    If  an  Airman  meeting  the  career  field  requirements, within  the  appropriate  grade  requirements,  is  not  available,  a  member  from  within  the squadron but different flight should be sought. (i.e. If the fallen is EOD, the FAR should come from EOD flight or another flight within the CES).  (T-1) 13.3.4.4.  Volunteers.  It is encouraged to only use volunteers to serve as a FAR.  In the absence of a volunteer, a FAR will be appointed.  (T-1) 13.3.4.5.  Leadership.    Commanders  and  First  Sergeants  will  not  serve  as  FAR  as  their responsibility is to the unit as a whole.  (T-1) 13.3.5.  Assigning  a  FAR.    FARs  should  be  identified  within  12-hours  of  notification  of anAir  Force  active  duty  death;  orders  and  training  should  be  completed  within  24-hours  of the FAR being identified.  (T-1) 13.3.5.1.  Notification  of  assignment.    All  efforts  will  be  made  to  include  the  assigned FAR  in  the  Initial  Death  Message.

Introducing the FAR.  The Mortuary Officer will apprise the PADD of the role of  a  FAR  and  insure  that  they  wish  to  be  assigned  a  FAR.    Once  this  has  been determined, the Mortuary Officer will provide the name and rank of the FAR, and let the PADD know they will receive an introductory call from the FAR.   NOTE:  If PADD is not  PNOK  and  second  FAR  is  appointed,  Mortuary  Officer  should  also  contact  PNOK.  (T-1) 13.3.5.3.  FAR  connection  with  the  family.    Face-to-face  contact  with  the  family  will begin on or about the same time as the CAR’s initial outreach, but will be dictated by the family’s  needs.    Ideally,  the  FAR  and  the  CAR  will  meet  the  family  together.    It  is discouraged for the FAR to meet with family members alone.  (T-1) 13.3.6.  Training Requirements.  Training is divided into two categories:  Annual Awareness training  and  Just-in-Time  (JIT)  training,  both  of  which  can  be  found  on  the  AFMAO Sharepoint site.  All training will be conducted in accordance with this guidance as follows: 13.3.6.1.  Leadership  training  requirements.    The  FSS  will  facilitate  FAR  Annual Awareness training for Wing, Group and Squadron Commanders, Chiefs, First Sergeants. (T-1) 13.3.6.1.1.  The  FSS  may  provide  face-to-face  Annual  Awareness  training,  or  they may  elect  to  provide  the  power  point  presentation,  or  other  subsequent  training provided by AFMAO/MA, via electronic distribution.  (T-1) 13.3.6.2.  FAR  training  requirements.    JIT  training  will  be  provided  to  newly  appointed FARs by the Mortuary Officer or Mortuary Tech within 24-hours of being identified as the  FAR  for  an  active  duty  death.    In  addition  to  JIT  training,  a  printable  FAR  Quick Reference Guide and FAR Brochure can be found on the AFMAO Sharepoint site.  The FAR  Quick  Reference  Guide  will  serve  as  a  tool  to  enhance  the  performance  of  FAR duties;  the  customizable  FAR  Brochure  will  help  the  assigned  family  member(s) understand  the  role  of  a  FAR,  as  well  as  provide  important  contact  information  (See Attachments 10, 11, and 12).  (T-1) 13.3.6.2.1.  The  Mortuary  Officer  should  provide  the  FAR  with  basic  information about  the  deceased,  if  not  previously  known  to  the  FAR,  and  apprise  of  any  known family dynamics.  (T-1) 13.3.6.3.  Content  of  Training.   Mandatory  FAR  Annual  Awareness  training  is specifically  designed  to  provide  installation  leadership  with  the  basic  knowledge  of  the proper methods of identifying and appointing an appropriate FAR for a deceased Airman.  The installation Mortuary Officer will make revisions and additions as needed to address specific local conditions.  JIT training will prepare the appointed FAR with the required instructions needed to assist the family; JIT training will include local resource and case-specific information.  (T-1) 13.3.7.  Duties and Responsibilities of the FAR.  FARs should have a basic understanding of the  various  functional  specialists’  areas  of  expertise  without  trying  to  become  experts themselves,  and  to  seek  out  the  appropriate  SMEs  for  thorough  answers  to  any  specific questions  families  might  have.    Below  is  a  list  of  common  duties  and  responsibilities  of  a FAR after the initial introductions have been made:   170  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 13.3.7.1.  Coordinating  assorted  services.    The  FAR  will  assist  the  PADD/PNOK  in coordinating  the  delivery  of  entitlements,  special  pay  or  benefits  available  to  them  by ensuring  the  family  is  connected  with  the  appropriate  agencies’  SMEs.    The  FAR  will assist the PADD/PNOK  with any other necessary services, resources or information that can  assist  during  a  very  difficult  time,  while  also  attempting  to  anticipate  future  needs they may require.  (T-1) 13.3.7.2.  Funeral/unit  memorial  arrangements.    The  appointed  FAR  may  be  present during  funeral  or  memorial  services  planning,  if  requested  by  the  PADD,  to  take  notes that may be of assistance to the family.  (T-1) 13.3.7.2.1.  The  FAR,  along  with  other  personnel  from  the  home  station  unit  of  the fallen  Airman,  will  provide  logistical  support  to  family  members  that  travel  to  the losing installation for the installation/unit memorial service. This support may include providing transportation in government vehicles from and to the airport and setting up lodging arrangements. (T-1) 13.3.7.3.  Utilization of the FAR Quick Reference Guide.  The FAR will comply with the checklist and maintain a detailed, daily log of events found in the FAR Quick Reference Guide.  (T-1) 13.3.7.3.1.  Upon completion of FAR duties, the FAR will complete the After Action Report,  also  found  in  the  FAR  Quick  Reference  Guide,  to  identify  areas  of  concern for  the  family,  lessons  learned,  and  other  process  improvements  related  to  the performance  of  FAR  duties  (  i.e.  shifts  in  family  dynamics,  FAR  training  and preparation,  outstand  issues,  etc.).    The  FAR  will  turn  in  all  paperwork  associated with the FAR Quick Reference Guide in to the Mortuary Officer to be included in the mortuary case file.  (T-1) 13.3.8.  When the FAR should seek assistance.  There are numerous situations that may arise that the FAR is not able to adequately address.  For example, the needs of the FAR or family become too  great  to  handle without additional assistance;  unforeseen situations arise which prevent the FAR from being able to adequately continue their duties and responsibilities; the duty  becomes  too  emotionally  taxing  for  the  FAR,  etc.    In  such  cases,  the  FAR  should contact his or her commander and/or the installation Mortuary Officer for guidance. 13.3.9.  FAR  duties  NOT  authorized.    FARs  s  WILL  NOT  be  responsible  for  personally performing the following types of assistance: 13.3.9.1.  Counsel.    Grief,  bereavement  or  other  types  of  counseling  are  not  the  FARs area  of  expertise.    Rather,  the  FAR  will  alert  the  Mortuary  Officer  that  such  care  is needed  or  requested  at  the  local  level.    The  Mortuary  Officer  may  consult  with  the  Air Force  Families  Forever  (AFFF)  program  manager  to  determine  available  resources  for family members who are not eligible for military benefits (i.e. are not in DEERS and do not have access to military support networks).  (T-1) 13.3.9.2.  Sign  documents  or  make  legal  decisions.  The FAR will never make funeral or memorial service arrangements, or sign any documents on behalf of the PADD/PNOK.  (T-1) AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   171  13.3.9.3.  Perform misc. chores.  Housekeeping, cleaning, babysitting, cooking or other household chores should not be performed by the FAR.  The FAR should instead coordinate assistance from unit volunteers or other support elements to meet these needs.  (T-1) 13.3.9.4.  Provide transportation in their POV.  All efforts will be made to utilize a GOV or rental vehicle for the transport of family members to military offices or appointments, and only if requested by the family.  (T-1) 13.3.9.5.  Handle  media  requests.    If  the  family  receives  requests  from  media  for interviews, etc. the FAR will seek the assistance of the installation Public Affairs office for support and advice concerning the handling of the press.  (T-1) 13.3.9.6.  Make  promises  or  commitments.    A  FAR  should  never  put  themselves  in  the position of making promises or commitments, and should always consult leadership when in doubt.  They should seek assistance from SMEs who will provide answers to questions raised by family members.  (T-1) 13.3.10.  When a FAR Should Terminate Services.  The general timeline for a FAR to fulfill his  or  her  duties  is  approximately  two  weeks  from  the  date  of  death,  this  allows  time  for funeral services and the installation memorial service, if held, to be completed, and benefits counseling  accomplished.  For  ANG Traditional  Guardsmen deaths  (typically not  on  active duty orders), the general timeline for FAR commitment is seven (7) days.  If additional time is requested beyond 7 days, please contact NGB/A1S for further guidance.  (T-1) 13.3.10.1.  There  are  cases  when  a  FAR  may  be  required  to  be  available  for  longer periods  of  time,  such  as  when  an  investigation  is  pending  completion,  or  in  complex cases  where  extra  assistance  is  needed.    Even  then,  contact  with  the  family  may  be intermittent and by phone.  (T-1) 13.3.10.2.  The  duration  of  the  FAR  assignment  will  be  determined  by  the  Installation MO,  who  will  then  send  the  Completion  of  Family  Assistance  Representative  duties letter, found on the AFMAO Sharepoint site, to  the affected PADD/PNOK.  Before the FAR discontinues his or her services or outreach, he or she will ensure that this letter has been mailed.  (T-1) 13.4.  SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 13.4.1.  Overview.    There  are  certain  circumstances  that  require  additional  support  beyond that  identified  to  this  point  in  this  chapter.    The  Mortuary  Officer  will  ensure  the  FAR  is available,  in  person,  to  support  the  PADD/PNOK,  as  applicable,  under  the  following circumstances: 13.4.2.  PADD geographically separated from the installation of the deceased permanent duty assignment. (T-1) 13.4.2.1.  The  Mortuary  Officer  will  approve  mortuary  funding  for  travel  orders  for  the Family  Assistance  Representative  to  travel  to  support  the  PADD  for  the  following circumstances: 13.4.2.1.1.  To  the  location  of  the  PADD  to  provide  direct  support  and  marshal assistance.  If the PADD is other than the PNOK, the FAR will ensure daily contact with the PNOK to address their requirements of assistance, unless support is declined   172  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 as outlined in paragraph 13.2.10.4. or the unit commander may appoint another FAR to  provide assistance to  the PNOK.   If a second  FAR is  appointed, they  will ensure daily coordination with each other to ensure continuity in the message conveyed with all affected family.  (T-1) 13.4.2.1.2.  Be  present  for  the  delivery  of  the  Personal  Property/Personal  Effects,  if requested  to  be  present  by  the  Person  Eligible  to  Receive  Effects  (PERE).    The Mortuary Officer will need to advise the FAR, when this support is requested by the PERE  and  coordinates  with  the  Summary  Courts  Officer  to  ensure  the  FAR  is presence for delivery.  (T-1) 13.4.3.  Deaths Occurring in Theaters of Combat Operations.  In cases where an Airman  dies in  a  declared  Combat  Theater  of  Operations  and  the  remains  are  returned  through  Dover AFB, DE, there are key responsibilities for a FAR that do not exist in other deaths: 13.4.3.1.  FAR assignment for a Dignified Transfer (DT).  When a FAR is assigned to a family  where  the  PNOK  elects  travel  to  Dover  AFB,  DE  to  witness  the  DT  of  a  fallen Airman, the FAR is authorized and expected to travel with the family or if geographically separated,  meet  the  family  upon  arrival  in  the  Dover  AFB,  DE  area.    In  this  case,  it  is essential that the FAR be assigned and trained expediently prior to travel.  (T-1) 13.4.3.2.  FAR travel to Dover AFB, DE.  AFMAO/MA will arrange travel for the family and FAR.  If the FAR and family are geographically co-located, the FAR will coordinate travel  for  he/she,  along  with  the  family,  to  the  airport.    If  the  FAR  and  family  are geographically  separated,  the  FAR  should  meet  the  family  at  a  connecting  airport  if possible.  In the latter case, the FAR needs to locate the family and remain with them for the  rest  of  the  journey  to  Dover  AFB,  DE.    The  FAR  will  be  responsible  for  handling interactions  with  airport  staff  and  communication  with  AFMAO/MA,  if  complications arise.  The FAR will contact the AFMAO/MA case manager prior to departure to ensure communication  is  established  to  seamlessly  complete  the  trip  to  Dover  AFB,  DE  from area airports or address issues that may arise during travel.  (T-1) 13.4.3.3.  FAR responsibilities while at Dover AFB, DE.  While at Dover AFB, DE, the FAR will attend to the family’s needs to the extent desired by the family.  The FAR will not  act  as  an  intermediary  between  the  family  and  AFMAO  staff.    The  FAR  will  be required  to  transport  families  within  the  local  area  for  meals  and  other  needs  with  a government  vehicle  provided  by  AFMAO,  as  available.    The  FAR  must  have  a  GOV driver’s license and a state-issued civilian driver’s license in his or her possession.  The FAR will be directed by AFMAO for further requirements as they arise on a case-by-case basis.  (T-1)       AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   173   13.4.4.  Duty  Status  –  Whereabouts  Unknown  (DUSTWUN)/Missing  in  Action  (MIA).    A FAR may be assigned, at the discretion of the installation Mortuary Officer, in cases where the whereabouts of a member is unknown, or determined to be missing in action or detained.  The  FAR,  in  these  cases,  may  be  present  as  the  family  is  provided  the  most  up-to-date information, as well as provide support as needed.  (T-1).  DANIEL R.

If a dependent family member dies before the service member, interment is made in an  installation  cemetery  upon  submission  of  a  certificate  signed  by  the  service  member verifying  he  or  she  will  be  interred  in  the  same  grave  or  an  adjoining  (side-by-side)  grave.  This  certificate  will  be  presented  or  promptly  mailed  to  the  base  Mortuary  Officer.    The certificate will state, “This is to certify that in consideration of the interment of the remains of  my  (spouse-child)  (name),  in  the  (name)  Base  Cemetery,  my  remains  will,  upon  my demise, be interred in the same or adjoining grave." A4.7.2.  When  a  dependent  child  is  interred  prior  to  the  death  of  either  parent,  the  service member will complete the certificate referenced in paragraph A4.8.1  The certificate will be completed with the understanding all available space in the occupied grave must be used for any  future  family  interment  before  the  second  grave  can  be  used  and  this  applies  to  the service member as well. A4.7.3.  Additional  eligible  dependent  family  members  will  be  interred  before  the  death  of the service member, provided not more than two side-by-side graves are used and the space is reserved for burial of the service member. A4.8.  Reserving  Gravesites.  Gravesites  will  not  be  reserved  or  assigned  in  advance  of interments except for an adjoining gravesite alongside a previously interred eligible member or dependent.    This  will  ensure  a  member  and  his/her  dependents  are  buried  together.  When  the service member dies first, an adjoining grave will be reserved for the eventual interment of the surviving  spouse.    The  spouse  must  request  their  interment  reservations  at  the  time  interment arrangements are being  made for the member.  The surviving spouse receives an inquiry every two years to verify whether to continue the reservation.  Until the inquiry is received, it will not be necessary for the spouse to contact the base concerned to continue the reservation.  Failure to reserve an adjoining gravesite does not preclude burial of the spouse in the same grave with the service  member  or  removal  of  remains  at  private  expense  to  a  location  where  two  adjoining   194  AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015 graves are available.  When arrangements are made for the interment of a dependent of a service member, the surviving service member requests an adjoining gravesite be reserved. A4.9.  Disposal.  When feasible, base cemeteries are disposed of according to the provisions of AFI  32-9004,  Disposal  of  Real  Property.    Normally,  the  General  Services  Administration accomplishes disposal by transfer to a state, county, municipality, or other proper agency or by removal and re-interment of remains in a government, private, or public cemetery or by transfer of custody to the PADD or other relatives.  Once a cemetery disposal is complete, it will not be reacquired  without  prior  approval  of  an  acquisition  request  as  outlined  in  AFI  32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property. A4.10.  Record and Reports.  The Force Support Squadron will maintain a complete record of interments in base cemeteries. Upon event of a new burial, the AF Form 593, Interment Record-Base Cemetery, will be prepared.  The original will filed for record and a duplicate, if applicable, will  be  placed  in  the  mortuary  folder.  All  records  will  be  maintained  with  the  Force  Support Squadron IAW AFI 33-322, Records Management Program. On closure of an installation where a  base  cemetery  is  located,  the  Base  Records  Manager  will  request  disposition  instructions  for cemetery and burial records in accordance with AFI 33-364, Records Disposition-Procedues and Responsibilities. A4.11.  Maintenance of Cemeteries.  Cemeteries are classified as improved grounds according to  the  standards  for  maintenance  of  grounds  and  drainage  as  adopted  by  DOD.    Lands  in  this classification  are  maintained  at  a  degree  necessary  to  present  a  desirable  appearance.  The maintenance  of  storm  drainage  systems  is  performed  to  the  extent  necessary  to  prevent  water damaging  soil  erosion  and  recurrent  flooding.    All  maintenance  of  cemeteries  is  confined  to existing  facilities  and  will  be  accomplished  according  to  the  standards  prescribed  in  the following paragraphs: A4.11.1.  Maintain  Grounds  in  accordance  with  the  CSAF-specified  Air  Force  Common Output Level Standards (AFCOLS) levels. A4.11.1.1.  Maintain  grounds  to  include:  mowing  every  1-2  weeks  as  season  dictates, fertilization,  weed  control,  insect  and  rodent  control,  plant  disease  control,  pruning  and renovation  of  trees,  shrubs  and  vines,  removal  of  debris  and  control  of  traffic.    If  trees and shrubs have to be removed due to  growth into a fence line, beautify the grounds as needed to present a desirable appearance. A4.11.2.  Maintain all roads and walks in a manner that protects the government investment.  Keep them in safe condition.  Apply dust palliatives to roads and walks where necessary. A4.11.3.  Maintain structures, including buildings, walls, fences, gates, and flagpoles to ensure stability.  The necessity for repainting cemetery structures is determined on the basis of preservation and appearance. Repair fences when they are broken due to natural disasters. A4.11.4.  Keep  grave  markers  clean  and  neat  in  appearance  at  all  times.    For  military markers, replace only when defaced or damaged to the extent that they no longer present an acceptable appearance and is beyond repair. A headstone that needs to be replaced is one that which  is  badly  deteriorated,  illegible,  or  vandalized.    Reset  and  realign  military  when necessary (such as in the event of sunken graves) to maintain uniformity of appearance and arrangement. Headstones in private or historical cemeteries are not under DoD's jurisdiction, AFI34-501  18 AUGUST 2015   195  nor is there currently any appropriation to replace any of the headstones.  Therefore, the Air Force is not responsible to replace those headstones. A4.11.5.  Maintain  water  distribution  systems  as  necessary  to  provide  a  supply  of  water adequate to meet requirements for the cemetery. A4.11.6.  Due  to  soil  and  climate  variations,  geographical  locations,  structure  types  and permanence,  plus  other  factors,  detailed  criteria  for  cemetery  maintenance  is  prescribed  by each Installation Commander having responsibility for such work. A4.11.7.  Do not initiate new construction work at base military cemeteries.  Improvements, alterations,  or  extensions  to  existing  facilities  are  not  authorized.    The  replacement  of,  or major repairs to, existing roads, walks, grounds, fences, buildings, drainage facilities or other features  will  be  accomplished  only  where  determination  is  made  that  the  cemetery  will remain  indefinitely  and  that  its  maintenance  will  continue  to  be  the  responsibility  of  the Department of the Air Force. A4.11.8.  Environmental Quality Funding may be used if the grave (s) or cemetery is either a  National Historic Landmark (NHL),  a part or in total a National Historic Landmark District (NHLD).  A National Historic Landmark (NHL)   is a building, site, structure, or object that is  officially  recognized  by  the  United  States  government  for  its  outstanding  degree  of historical significance.  A National Historic Landmark District (NHLD) is a historic district that has received similar recognition. Table A4.1.
