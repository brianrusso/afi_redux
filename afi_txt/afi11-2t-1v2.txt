Conducting  Evaluations.  Conduct  all  T-1A  aircrew  evaluations  according  to  the provisions in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this AFI. (T-1). 1.2.  Recommended Changes and Waivers: 1.2.1.  Submit suggested changes to this AFI via AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of  Publication,  to  the  parent  MAJCOM  through  standardization/evaluation  channels.  (T-1). (AF Form 847 is prescribed in AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program [FMP].  Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form.) 1.2.2.  AF/A3 is approval authority for changes or revisions to this instruction. (T-1). 1.2.3.  Except  as  specified  elsewhere  in  this  instruction,  AETC/A2/3/10  is  the  waiver authority  for  this  instruction.    (T-2).  Waiver  requests  will  be  submitted  in  memorandum format and will be sent through the stan/eval chain of command. (T-2). 1.3.  Procedures.  T-1A  certified  flight  examiners  will  give  emergency  procedures,  instrument, qualification,  and  mission  evaluations  to  aircrew  members  of  the  same  rating  only.  (T-2). Exception: AETC/A3V designated T-1A pilot flight examiners may administer combat systems officer (CSO) evaluations. Pilot Instructor Training T-1A pilot flight examiners may administer combat system officer (CSO) initial CSO Right Seat (CRS) qualification evaluations. 1.3.1.  Flight  examiners  (FE)  will  use  the  evaluation  criteria  in  Chapter  3  to  conduct  flight and  emergency  procedure  evaluations  (EPE).  (T-2).    To  ensure  standard  and  objective evaluations, FEs must become thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria. 1.3.2.  Unless specified, the examinee or FE may fly in any seat or authorized flight position that will best enable the FE to conduct a thorough evaluation. A qualified instructor pilot will be at a set of controls for all CSO evaluations in the aircraft. (T-2). 1.3.3.  Prior to the flight, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be conducted. (T-2).  The examinee will accomplish all flight planning required of  the  flight  position  during  the  evaluation.    Higher  headquarters  FEs  (and  unit  FEs,  as determined  locally)  will  be  furnished  a  copy  of  necessary  mission  data,  mission  materials, and charts.  (T-2). 1.3.4.  Areas required by AFI 11-202, Volume 2, are indicated in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of this  instruction.  Use  an  alternate  method  of  evaluation  (such  as  an  aircrew  training  device [ATD]  or  oral  examination)  to  complete  the  evaluation  when  it  is  impossible  to  evaluate  a required  area  in  flight.  (T-2).    Document  the  alternate  evaluation  method  on  AF  Form  8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, in the examiner's remarks of the comments block.  (T-2). 1.3.4.1.  Recurring periodic CRS qualification (QUAL) evaluations may be conducted in the simulator at the discretion of the FE.  Profile must follow a normal sortie profile and be  flown  in  “real  time.”    (T-2).    The  simulator’s  visible  fidelity  may  require  the   4  AFI11-2T-1V2  16 JULY 2015 evaluation  to  be  flown  away  from  the  examinee’s  “local  area”  for  the  low  level navigation requirement. 1.3.4.1.1.  If  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluation  (EPE)  requirements  are  also  met  in the  simulator,  separate  the  EPE  from  the  QUAL  evaluation.    EPE  requisite  may  be accomplished prior to or after the QUAL evaluation sortie profile. 1.3.5.  The  FE  will  thoroughly  debrief  all  aspects  of  the  flight.      (T-2).    This  debrief  will include the examinee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified), and any required additional training. A squadron supervisor must be debriefed on all check rides.  (T-2).  Additionally, if the overall grade is Q-2 or Q-3, a squadron supervisor must attend the debriefing.  (T-2). 1.4.  Grading Instructions: 1.4.1.  Tolerances  in  performance  parameters  are  based  on  conditions  of  smooth  air  and  a stable  aircraft.  Momentary  deviations  from  tolerances  will  not  be  considered  in  grading, provided  the  examinee  applies  prompt  corrective  action  and  such  deviations  do  not jeopardize flying safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade. 1.4.2.  Compare  examinee  performance  for  each  area  accomplished  during  the  evaluation with  the  standards  provided  in  this  instruction  (Figure  1.1  and  Chapter  3)  and  assign  an appropriate grade for the area. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade (Q-1, Q-2, or Q-3) from  the  area  grades,  based  on  a  composite  for  the  observed  events  and  tasks  according  to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this instruction. 1.4.3.  If an examinee receives an unqualified grade in any of the critical areas identified in this publication, an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) will be assigned. (T-2). 1.4.4.  FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade. 1.4.5.  The general evaluation criteria in Figure 1.1 apply during all phases of flight (except as noted for specific events and instrument final approaches). Figure 1.1.  General Evaluation Criteria. 1.5.  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluation  (EPE).  If available and configured appropriately, an ATD should be used to conduct the requisite EPE for pilot instrument/qualification evaluations and  CSO  qualification  (QUAL)  evaluations.    If  an  ATD  is  not  used,  the  EPE  will  be  given verbally.  (T-2).  Exception: ATDs are not required for the requisite EPE of I-2 Air operations qualification (QUAL) mission (MSN) evaluations and will be given verbally.  1.5.1.  EPEs will include: 1.5.1.1.  Aircraft general knowledge.  (T-2). AFI11-2T-1V2  16 JULY 2015   5  1.5.1.2.  Emergency procedures. Evaluate all boldface procedures and a minimum of one emergency procedure per phase of flight.  (T-2). 1.5.1.3.  Pilot:  Use  of  standby  or  emergency  instruments  and  a  minimum  of  one instrument  approach.    (T-2).  CRS  ICSO:  Direct/monitor  a  minimum  of  one  instrument approach. (T-2). 1.5.1.4.  I-2  CSO  Evaluations.  Additionally,  FEs  will  administer  a  ground  evaluation emphasizing  emergency  ground  egress  procedures,  CSO  proficiency  procedures,  local mission knowledge and aircrew flight equipment.  (T-2). 1.6.  Completion of AF Form 8: 1.6.1.  Use AF Form 8 to record and certify aircrew qualification, in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 2.  (T-1). 1.6.2.  Place all comments, except restrictions and the exceptionally qualified designation (if used), on the reverse side of the AF Form 8.  (T-1). 1.6.3.  Log all mission (MSN) evaluations, including transition, airdrop, air refueling (A/R), basic formation, navigation  (instrument fight rules [IFR] or visual flight rules [VFR]),  basic navigation, air operations, and air intercept,  as "MSN" evaluations in the flight phase block of  AF  Form  8.  In  accordance  with  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2,  and  the  lead  command supplement, includes additional clarification as to the specific type of mission evaluation in the mission description section of the comments block.  (T-1).   6  AFI11-2T-1V2  16 JULY 2015 Chapter 2 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  Guidelines.  All  evaluations  will  follow  guidelines  in  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2.  (T-1).  See Table 2.1 of this instruction for pilot evaluation requirements. Pilot evaluations are divided into three types: instrument (INSTM), qualification (QUAL), and mission (MSN).  MSN evaluation categories  include  transition,  airdrop,  air  refueling,  basic  formation,  navigation/low-level navigation, and air intercept. See Table  2.2 for CSO evaluation requirements. CSO evaluations are  divided  into  two  evaluation  types:  qualification  (QUAL)  and  mission  (MSN).  MSN evaluation categories include instructing navigation/low-level navigation, air operations, and air intercept.  Use all areas for criteria applicable to the events performed on the evaluation. 2.1.1.  Unless  specified,  evaluations  may  be  combined  if  all  requisites  and  Table  2.1  or Table 2.2 flight-required items are accomplished for each evaluation administered. 2.1.2.  Table 2  1 and 2.2 areas indicated with an "R" are required items for that evaluation. A  required  area  is  a  specific  area  that  must  be  evaluated  to  complete  the  evaluation.  All required  areas  must  be  included  in  the  flight  evaluation  profile.    (T-2).    However,  if  it  is impossible to accomplish a required area in flight, the FE may elect to evaluate the area by an alternate  method  (such  as  ATD,  oral,  etc.)  in  order  to  complete  the  evaluation.  If  the  FE determines  a  required  item  cannot  be  adequately  evaluated  by  an  alternate  method,  an additional flight by the examinee will be required to complete the evaluation.  (T-2). 2.1.3.  Table  2  1  and  2.2  areas  indicated  with  an  asterisk  (*)  are  critical  items  for  that evaluation and are graded Q or U only. 2.2.  Formal  Course  Evaluations.  Syllabus  evaluations  will  be  flown  according  to  syllabus mission  profile  guidelines  (if  stated)  or  on  a  mission  profile  developed  from  syllabus  training objectives.  (T-2). To complete the evaluation, formal course guidelines may be modified based on local operating considerations or FE judgment. Syllabus tasks not addressed in Section C will be evaluated using criterion-referenced objectives (CRO) from the appropriate syllabus. 2.3.  Instructor  Evaluations  (INSTR).  To  qualify  initially  as  an  instructor,  qualified  T-1A aircrew must successfully complete an initial instructor/mission evaluation (INIT INSTR/MSN), normally accomplished in conjunction with formal mission qualification training.  (T-2). 2.3.1.  Periodically  evaluate  the  ability  of  qualified  T-1A  aircrew  to  instruct,  in  accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 2. 2.3.2.  Unless specified, examinees will occupy the seat most appropriate for the mission, as determined by the FE, unit supplemental guidance, and aircrew certifications. 2.3.3.  Attempt  to  accomplish  recurring,  periodic  MSN  evaluations  during  actual  formal training course missions, with the examinee instructing student or upgrade aircrew. 2.4.  Pilot Evaluations. 2.4.1.  Instrument  (INSTM).  T-1A  instrument  evaluations  are  generally  combined  with  a qualification  evaluation.  Examinees  will  fly  a  mission  in  accordance  with  instrument  flight rules (IFR) and accomplish Table 2.1 requirements.  (T-2). AFI11-2T-1V2  16 JULY 2015   7  2.4.1.1.  Examinees  should  accomplish  requisites  prior  to  the  flight  portion  of  the evaluation, and include, at minimum, an instrument examination. 2.4.2.  Qualification  (QUAL).  T-1A  qualification  evaluations  are  generally  combined  with an instrument evaluation. Include visual and instrument approaches at airfields other than the examinee's home field to the maximum extent possible. The examinee will complete  Table 2.1 requirements.  (T-2). 2.4.2.1.  Requisites  should  be  accomplished  prior  to  the  flight  portion  of  the  evaluation and  at  a  minimum  will  include  a  boldface  examination,  EPE,  closed-book  examination, and open book examination.  (T-2). 2.4.2.2.  During  the  evaluation,  check    TO  1T-1A-1,  Flight  Manual  USAF  Series  T-1A Aircraft; TO 1T-1A-1-1, Flight Manual Appendix 1 Performance Data; TO 1T-1A-1CL-1,  Abbreviated  Flight  Crew  Checklist;  TO  1T-1A-1CL-1-1  Pilots  Fanfold  Checklist, supplemental  T-1A  flight  manuals  (Dash-2),  as  applicable;  and  unit  specific  in-flight guides.  (T-2). 2.4.3.  Examinees  will  occupy  the  left  seat  for  initial  and  requalification  instrument,  and qualification  evaluations,  and  may  occupy  either  seat  for  periodic  instrument  and qualification evaluations as determined by the FE or unit supplemental guidance.  (T-2). 2.4.4.  MSN  Evaluations.  Scenarios that represent unit taskings satisfy the requirements of this  evaluation.  Design  profiles  to  evaluate  examinee's  training,  flight  position,  special qualifications,  and  basic  airmanship.  Give  initial  mission  evaluations  in  the  unit's  primary mission. The FE may perform pilot not flying duties and simulate student errors during this evaluation. 2.4.4.1.  Typical  T-1A  mission  areas  include  transition,  high  level  navigation,  low  level navigation,  basic  formation,  formation  airdrop,  air  refueling,  and  air  intercept.  The formation mission (basic formation, airdrop and air refueling) areas and requirements do not  apply  to  pilots  whose  primary  mission  is  CSO  training.    The  air  intercept  mission does  not  apply  to  those  pilots  whose  primary  mission  is  Undergraduate  Pilot  or  Pilot Instructor Training (unless certified). 2.4.4.2.  Requisites  should  be  accomplished  prior  to  the  flight  portion  of  the  evaluation and,  at  minimum  will  include  an  EPE  and  a  boldface  examination.    (T-2).    If  the qualification and mission evaluation eligibility periods overlap, a single EPE may fulfill the  requirement  for  both  evaluations,  if  accomplished  within  both  eligibility  periods.  A separate boldface examination is required for each evaluation.  (T-2). Table 2.1.  Pilot Evaluations.
