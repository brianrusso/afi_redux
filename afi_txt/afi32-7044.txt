Concept.  Storage tanks, properly operated and maintained IAW environmental regulatory requirements,  perform  an  essential  function  in  support  of  the  Air  Force  mission.    Where petroleum and hazardous substances are necessary for use by the Air Force mission, they may be stored  in  regulatory  compliant  underground  and  aboveground  storage  tanks.    Tank  systems  are operated  and  maintained  to  comply  with  the  more  stringent  applicable  federal,  state,  or  local regulations and this AFI requirement.  1.2.  Scope.  This  AFI  describes the  environmental  and  engineering  requirements  for underground  and  aboveground  storage  tanks  and  associated  piping  storing  petroleum  and hazardous substances. This AFI addresses the environmental compliance requirements associated with Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 112, Oil Pollution Prevention, and 280, Technical  Standards  and  Corrective  Action  Requirements  for  Owners  and  Operators  of Underground Storage Tanks (USTs), or overseas equivalent; see AFI 23-502, Recoverable Fuel, and  AFI  23-204,  Organizational  Fuel  Tanks,  for  instructions  on  managing  organizational  fuel storage  tanks.  This  AFI  does  not  address  storage  of  wastes  other  than  oils.    Hazardous  waste storage is addressed in AFI 32-7042, Waste Management, and Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 32-7043, Hazardous Waste Management Guide.  1.3.  Objectives.  This  instruction  provides  MAJCOMs,  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Center (AFCEC),  DRUs,  and  installations  with  a  framework  for  complying  with  regulatory requirements for storage tanks and associated piping storing petroleum and hazardous substances except hazardous and radioactive waste. In the United States, use this instruction with applicable federal,  state, and local  standards for storage tanks. For Air Force organizations at  installations outside  the  United  States,  implement  the  applicable  portions  of  this  AFI  (i.e.,  all  paragraphs except those with asterisks) IAW the applicable FGS or, in their absence, the OEBGD.  1.4.  Applicable Standards  and Regulations.  The Air Force complies with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations; Executive Orders (E.O.); DoD and Air Force publications, technical  orders,  and  policies;  and,  overseas,  with  the  OEBGD,  appropriate  FGS,  international agreements,  through  applicable  portions  of  this  AFI.    Air  Force  activities  in  overseas  locations must implement this AFI IAW the appropriate FGS or, in their absence, the OEBGD. Provisions of  this  AFI  marked  by  an  asterisk  “*”  do  not  apply  in  overseas  locations.      The  following description  of  regulations  applicable  to  storage  tanks  describes  only  the  principal  requirements and is not intended to be exhaustive. Air Force personnel are expected to comply fully with the underlying regulatory requirements of Title 40 CFR Parts 112 and 280, and the applicable state programs.  Other  requirements  may  apply  to  storage  tanks  under  the  Clean  Air  Act  (CAA),  the Emergency  Planning  and  Community  Right-to-Know  Act  (EPCRA)  to  the  extent  authorized  by Executive  Order  13514,  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  Title  XV,  Subtitle  B  titled  Underground Storage Tank Compliance Act of 2005, and other environmental laws, Occupational Safety and Health  Administration  (OSHA)  regulations  and  the  national  codes  and  standards  listed  in Attachment 2 to this AFI. AFI32-7044  18 AUGUST 2015 5 1.4.1.  Underground Storage Tanks (UST). 1.4.1.1.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Title 42, United States Code  (U.S.C.),  Section  6901,  et  seq.  regulates  USTs  containing  regulated  substances. Regulated  substances  are  defined  at  40  CFR  Part  280.12  and  include  hazardous substances regulated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq., which are not otherwise regulated as RCRA hazardous waste, and petroleum and petroleum-based substances. 1.4.1.2.  The federal UST standards are found in 40 CFR Parts 280 and 281 (for approval of state UST programs.). 1.4.1.3.  Facility Response Plans.  The Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq., Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan and Facility Response Plan (FRP)  requirements,  found  in  40  CFR  Part  112,  do  not  apply  to  USTs  regulated  under and complying with applicable portions of 40 CFR Parts 280 and 281, except that USTs need to be included in the facility diagram [as provided in 40 CFR Part 112.7(a)(3)] or if the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) Regional Administrator otherwise requires the USTs to be included in the SPCC Plan [as provided in 40 CFR Part 112.1(f)]. Section 311(j)  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  requires  facilities  which  because  of  their  location  could reasonably be expected to cause “substantial harm” to the environment by a discharge of oil to develop and implement a FRP.  Substantial harm facilities are defined in 40 CFR Part 112. 1.4.1.4.  The  CAA  requirements  in  40  CFR  Part  60,  Subpart  Kb,  Standards  of Performance  for  Volatile  Organic  Liquid  Storage  Vessels  for  Which  Construction, Reconstruction,  or  Modification  Commenced  after  July  23,  1984,  apply  to  USTs  as pertinent. 1.4.2.  Aboveground Storage Tanks (AST). 1.4.2.1.  The  SPCC  and  FRP  requirements,  discussed  in  paragraph  1.4.1.3,  generally apply  to  ASTs  located  where  a  discharge  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  reach navigable  waters  (including  sewer  pathways)  unless  both:  (i)  the  completely  buried storage capacity of installation facility has a total aggregate of 42,000 gallons or less of oil  (see  Attachment  1);  and  (ii)  the  total  aggregate  aboveground  storage  capacity  of  the installation is 1,320 gallons or less of oil. Tanks which are 55 gallons or larger and store petroleum,  oil  or  lubricants  are  subject  to  SPCC  regulatory  requirements.  Refer  to  the EPA definition of ‘oil’ in Attachment 1, Terms. 1.4.2.1.1.  The SPCC Plan is  the document required by 40 CFR Part 112.3 detailing the  equipment,  workforce,  procedures  and  steps  to  prevent,  control,  and  provide adequate  countermeasures  for  a  potential  discharge.  The  relevant  requirements  for preparing a SPCC Plan are located in 40 CFR Parts 112.3 – 112.8. 1.4.2.1.2.  A facility shall also determine, IAW 40 CFR Part 112.20, whether, because of  its  location,  a  spill  of  oil  could  cause  substantial  harm  to  the  environment  by discharging oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines. (*note: does not apply in overseas locations) (T-0)   6 AFI32-7044  18 AUGUST 2015 1.4.2.1.2.1.  If  the  installation  (“facility”  as  defined  by  40  CFR  Part  112) determines  it  does  meet  the  substantial  harm  criteria,  it  shall  prepare  a  FRP  as provided  in  40  CFR  Part  112  Appendix  F  or  as  required  by  the  EPA  Regional Administrator. (* note: does not apply in overseas locations) (T-0) 1.4.2.1.2.2.  If  the  installation  (“facility”  as  defined  by  40  CFR  Part  112) determines  it  does  not  meet  the  substantial  harm  criteria,  it  shall  complete  and maintain  certification  that  the  criteria  do  not  apply.  Even  if  the  substantial  harm criteria are not met, the EPA administrator has the discretion to require an FRP. (* note: does not apply in overseas locations) (T-0) 1.4.2.2.  ASTs containing used oil, as defined in 40 CFR Part 279.1, must also meet the applicable RCRA used oil management requirements of 40 CFR Part 279. (* note: does not apply in overseas locations) (T-0) 1.4.2.3.  IAW  40  CFR  Part  112  SPCC  Plans  must  include  schedules  and  requirements defined for “periodic” inspections of Shop-Built  ASTs (see paragraph 2.3.3.).   40 CFR Part  112.3  (d)  (1)  (iii)  also  requires  the  SPCC  plan  has  been  prepared  IAW  good engineering practice including consideration of applicable industry standards. for  Volatile  Organic  Liquid  Vessels 1.4.2.4.  The  CAA  requirements  in  40  CFR  Part  60,  Subpart  (K)  (b),  Standards  of Performance for  Which  Construction, Reconstruction, or Modification Commenced after July 23, 1984 and Part 81 Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes apply to ASTs as pertinent.(* note: does not apply in overseas locations) 1.4.3.  States may adopt or enact storage tank regulations as long as those regulations are at least as stringent as federal storage tank regulations. Air Force installations must comply with state or local (a) UST regulations: and (b) AST requirements where sovereign immunity has been waived. Installations should consult with the installation Staff Judge Advocate to obtain guidance on whether state or local regulations are applicable to installation ASTs. (T-1) 1.4.4.  ASTs with underground piping that is 10% or more of the volume of the AST (i) may have additional regulatory requirements similar to UST regulatory requirements; (ii) may be considered an UST for regulatory purposes per the federal UST definition. Identify ASTs in this  category  and  manage  according  to  applicable  regulatory  requirements.  Note:  several states/local  regulators  have  different  approaches  for  regulating  UST,  AST,  and  associated piping  (ex.,  if  one  removes  a  tank  then  all  piping  is  to  be  removed  also,  but  in  another jurisdiction this requirement may not apply). (T-1) Also coordination with DLA is required. AFP expenditures for tanks and piping may be separated as between AF and DLA. (T-1) 1.4.5.  Guidance on the construction and operation of petroleum  storage tanks are  governed by  Unified  Facility  Criteria  (UFC)  3-460-01,  Design:  Petroleum  Fuels  Facilities,  UFC  3-460-03, Operation and Maintenance: Maintenance of Petroleum Systems, and DoD standard design  AW  78-24-27,  Standard  Fueling  Systems;  Aboveground  Vertical  Fuel  Tanks  with Floating Pan and Fixed Roofs, and from other sources including some of the national codes and standards listed in Attachment 2 to this AFI. 1.4.6.  The following AFIs provide policy and procedures as developed by the AF Logistics Readiness Division for AF fuels operations which cross reference this AFI. AFI32-7044  18 AUGUST 2015 7 1.4.6.1.

Facility  managers  must  report  suspected  releases  from  USTs  to  the  regulators within  24  hours,  as  per  40  CFR  Part  280.50,  Underground  Storage  Tanks,  and appropriate  investigation  and  confirmation  steps  taken.  (T-0)  The  following  are considered suspected releases: (*note: does not apply in overseas locations)  2.5.1.1.1.  The discovery of regulated substances at the UST site or in the surrounding area  (such  as  free  product  or  vapors  in  soils,  basements,  sewer  and  utility  lines  and near surface water).  2.5.1.1.2.  The system. (Note that mechanical automatic line leak detectors and some electronic  line  leak  detectors  unusual  operating  conditions,  such  as  the  erratic behavior of dispensing equipment, the sudden loss of product from the system, or an unexplained  loss  of  product  from  detectors  signal  a  suspected  line  leak  by  greatly slowing down the flow of product in the distribution line. This can appear as erratic operation  of  dispensing  equipment.)  Any  of  these  conditions  are  considered  a suspected  release  unless  system  equipment  is  found  to  be  defective  but  not  leaking within the 24 hour period allowed for reporting suspected releases and is immediately repaired or replaced. 2.5.1.1.3.  Facility  managers  must  report  monitoring  results  from  a  required  tank  or line release detection method that indicate a release may have occurred as a suspected release unless the following conditions can be met within the allowed 24-hour period. (T-0).  These  conditions  are:  the  monitoring  device  is  found  to  be  defective  and  is immediately  repaired,  recalibrated,  or  replaced  and  additional  monitoring  does  not confirm the initial result. (T-0) inventory  control  shows  excessive  variance  (that 2.5.1.1.4.  If is,  monthly reconciliations using the EPA leak check comparison of book inventories versus tank measurements  exceeds  1%  of  tank  throughput  plus  130  gallons),  facility  managers must report a suspected release and follow up if there are two consecutive months of excessive variances. See 40 CFR Part 280.43(a). (T-0) 2.5.1.1.5.  Additional release detection methods are available in 40 CFR Part 280.43. 2.5.2.  Responding to Releases.  2.5.2.1.

Accurate inventories are essential to environmental regulatory compliance and effective tank management.  The minimum essential data required includes, but is not limited to:  Table A4.1.  Tank Inventory Minimum Data Field Requirements. DATA FIELD ID Number PURPOSE Unique Identification Number to keep track of tank on the installation. Location The number of the building where  the tank is located or is the  closest real property asset where  the tank is located. Real Property ID Code Enter the real property ID code from real property records if an assigned real property asset. DESCRIPTION / EXAMPLE AA-1035-1-AST.  Use a standard format where AA – is the organization two letter code assigned by the installation  for each organization that has tanks, 1035 is typically the facility number, 1 – is the number of the tank at this location.  For example if there were three tanks at this same location this number would be either 1, 2 or 3 to uniquely identify each of the tanks, and finally the letters AST indicate this is an aboveground storage tank.  The last three letters would be UST if this tank were an underground storage tank. A number preferably from the installation real property records for the asset, which is a tank.  If there is no real property record facility number, use the closest facility number to the tank. This is the unique number assigned to real property assets.  Some assets and / or equipment do not have real property ID codes.
