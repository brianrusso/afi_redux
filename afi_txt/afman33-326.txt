Formats  Unique  to  the  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF).  The  HAF  formats  differ  from some of the other types of correspondence processes prescribed in  this manual.   These formats are unique to the HAF and are used for correspondence for preparing and submitted to the HAF and  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD)  and  the  President  of  the  United  States (POTUS),  located  in  the  Washington  DC  area.   Prepare  all  official  correspondence communicated  between  and  through  Secretariat  of  the  Air  Force  (SAF),  Air  Staff  and  the  AF leadership:  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SecAF);  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (USecAF); Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF); Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (VCSAF); Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (AVCSAF); and the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force in  HOI  33-3,  Correspondence (CMSAF)  action  using Preparation, Control and Tracking. the  formats/process  prescribed 1.2.  Plain  Language.  Prepare  all  AF  correspondence  using  plain  language.    The  Plain Language Act and Information Network (PLAIN), Plain Writing Act of 2010, signed on October 13, 2010 is the law that requires federal agencies use “clear Government communication that the public  can  understand  and  use.”    Plain  language  saves  the  AF  time,  effort,  and  money.    Key concepts of plain language to keep in mind are be clear, be concise, and be specific noted in AFI 33-360, Table 6.3 and at http://www.plainlanguage.gov. 1.2.1.  Organize  your material to help the reader.   Identify  your audience for the document; write  to  get  their  attention  and  anticipate  their  questions.    Consider  any  additional  readers.  Always start  by putting  your main message up front.  Present  information in  the succeeding paragraphs in a logical order. 1.2.2.  Avoid  words  and  phrases  that  your  readers  might  not  understand.    Define  each abbreviation or acronym the first time you use it.  Use the same term consistently to identify a  specific  thought  or  object.    Use  words  in  a  way  that  does  not  conflict  with  ordinary  or accepted usage.  Avoid ambiguous phrasing, confusing legal terms, and technical jargon that can mislead your reader. 1.2.3.  Use “you” and other pronouns to speak directly to readers (active voice).  Do not refer to people as if they were inanimate objects.  Address the reader as “you.”  “You” reinforces the message intended for your reader.  Use “we” in place of  your organization’s name.  Be careful  using  “you”  if  it  sounds  accusatory  or  insulting.    Instead,  put  the  emphasis  on  the organization by using “we.”  Example of an active voice is “The executive officer organized the commander’s call.”  Notice the subject (actor) comes first in the sentence.  Example of a passive voice is “The commander’s call will be organized by the executive officer.”  Notice the subject as receiver of the action. 1.2.4.  Active  voice  is  the  best  way  to  identify  who  is  responsible  for  what  action.    To communicate  effectively,  write  the  strong  majority  (around  75%)  of  your  sentences  in  the active voice. 1.2.5.  Short sentences deliver a clear message.  Average sentences to 15 to 20 words--never make  them  longer  than  40  words.    Complex  sentences  loaded  with  dependent  clauses  and AFMAN33-326  25 MAY 2017 5 exceptions  confuse  the  reader  by  losing  the  main  point  in  a  forest  of  words.    Resist  the temptation  to  put  everything in  one sentence.   Break up  your idea into its logical  parts  and make each one the subject of its own sentence.  Do not use unnecessary words. 1.3.  Writers’ Responsibilities. 1.3.1.  When applicable, use this manual along with other referenced materials for preparing correspondence. 1.3.2.  Protect  and  mark  any  classified  information  in  your  correspondence  according  to (DoDM) 5200.01, Volume 1, DoD Information Security Program: Overview, Classification, and  Declassification,  (DoDM)  5200.01,  Volume  2,  DoD  Information  Security  Program: Marking of Classified Information,  (DoDM) 5200.01, Volume 3, DoD Information Security Program:  Protection  of  Classified  Information,  (DoDM)  5200.01,  Volume  4,  DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and AFI 16-1404, Information  Security  Program  Management.  Distribute  correspondence  on  a  need-to-know basis.  Additional references below can also be utilized. 1.3.2.1.  Executive  Order  13526,  Classified  National  Security  Information  as  amended, located at website http://www.archives.gov. 1.3.2.2.  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (ODNI)/Controlled  Access Program  Coordination  Office  (CAPCO),  and  Information  Technology  solutions  that implement structured security marking metadata. 1.3.3.  Follow  AFI  16-1404,  if  you  include  “For  Official  Use  Only”  information  or  DoDM 5200.01, Vol 4, and refer to AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program, if Personally Identifiable Information exist. 1.3.4.  Check  the  Joint  Publication  (JP)  1-02,  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  Dictionary  of Military  and  Associated  Terms  and  the  Air  Force  Glossary,  for  standardized  and  Joint  and AF  terms  and  their  usage.    The  DOD  Dictionary  is  available  on  JDEIS  [Joint  Doctrine, Education,  and  Training  Information  System]  JEL+  [Joint  Electronic  Library  Plus]  at https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/index.jsp,  when  accessing  via  Nonsecure  Internet  Protocol  Router Network (NIPRNET) and also accessible online as a searchable database and in PDF format at  the  following  Internet  address:  http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary  and  at http://jdeis.js.smil.mil/jdeis/index.jsp  SECRET Internet  Protocol  Router  Network (SIPRNET),  and  on  the  JEL  [Joint  Electronic  Library]  at  http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine (NIPRNET).    Additionally,  the  AF  Glossary  is  available  on  the  AF  Doctrine  website  at https://doctrine.af.mil/DTM/dtmglossary.htm  located  on  Curtis  E.  LeMay  Center  for Doctrine Development and Education. 1.3.4.1.  The  contents  of  the  DOD  Dictionary  are  updated  on  a  monthly  basis  with terminology  additions,  modifications,  or  deletions  made  within  the  previous  calendar month  in  accordance  with  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  Instruction  (CJCSI) 5705.01, Standardization of Military and Associated Terminology.  Future editions of the DOD at https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/new_pubs/dictionary.pdf. Dictionary are posted online 1.3.4.2.  Overarching  policy,  procedures,  and  requirements  for  the  standardization  and use  of  terminology  within  DoD  can  be  found  in  Department  of  Defense  Instruction 6 AFMAN33-326  25 MAY 2017 (DoDI)  5025.12,  Standardization  of  Military  and  Associated  Terminology  and  CJCSI 5705.01. 1.3.5.  Conserve paper.  Use backs of scrap paper for drafts and interoffice memos.  Consider whether  you can communicate with other means such as a telephone call or electronic mail (Email).    Do  not  print  and  mail  out  correspondence  originally  sent  by  Email,  unless requested.    Satisfy  the  minimum  distribution  requirements  only.    Utilize  two-sided  printing whenever possible. 1.3.6.  Select  the  appropriate  distribution  method.    Some  distribution  methods  include:  Email,  facsimile  (FAX),  Defense  Message  System  (DMS),  United  States  Postal  Service (USPS),  and  Defense  Courier  Service  (DCS).    Consider  the  needs  of  the  recipient  when choosing  the  distribution  method.    When  transmitting  sensitive  unclassified  information  by Email,  apply  an  appropriate  level  of  safeguards  to  ensure  the  sensitive,  but  unclassified, information is properly protected.  However, do not send a classified Email on a system not authorized for that purpose.  Distribute correspondence on a need-to-know basis.  For more information refer to AFMAN 17-1201, User Responsibilities and Guidance for Information Systems.  When delegating an Email task, send a courtesy copy (cc) to the originator. 1.3.7.  Follow AFI 33-324, The Air Force Information Collections and Reports Management Program for information collecting and reporting of internal and public requirements.  This includes  the  licensing  of  internal  information  reports  and  collections  and/or  requesting information from the public in accordance with Chapter 35 of (PL) 104-13, The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. 1.3.8.  Avoid abbreviations and military jargon.   Write out  abbreviations  the first  time used and follow with the abbreviation in parentheses when listed for all other sentences. 1.3.9.  When  transmitting  classified  Email,  take  care  to  transmit  only  on  a  system  certified and accredited for that level of classified information. 1.4.  Suspense Actions. 1.4.1.  Set realistic time limits for answering priority and routine correspondence.  Establish a suspense (due date) only when you need a reply by a specific date.  Notify the action agency of the suspense date as early as possible. 1.4.2.  Control the suspense at all offices tasked with answering correspondence.  Notify the originating agency before the due date if the reply is delayed. 1.4.3.  You may use an automated system below the HAF or the AF TMT to control suspense actions. 1.5.  Coordination Process. 1.5.1.  Coordinate with offices affected by the proposed action during the draft stage to keep from  revising  the  final  version.    Consider  the  chain  of  command  to  ensure  complete coordination.  Schedule enough time to finish review and coordination. 1.5.2.  Coordinate by telephone or Email when possible.  Do not indicate coordination in the upper- right-hand corner since it is used for the file code (see AFMAN 33-363). 1.5.3.  Coordinate  using  AF  Form  1768,  Staff  Summary  Sheet  (electronic,  TMT,  hardcopy) (see paragraph 3.2). AFMAN33-326  25 MAY 2017 7 Chapter 2 STATIONERY STANDARDS AND USES 2.1.

DoDM  5110.04-M-V1,  DoD  Manual  for  Written  Material: Correspondence  Management,  establishes  the  standards  for  letterheads.    There  are  only  two types of letterhead authorized for use:   standard (pre-printed) and computer-generated.  Submit any  exceptions  to  the  specified  standards  through  your  Major  Command  (MAJCOM)  to SAF/CIO  A6  for  final  determination.    ANG  exceptions  are  approved  by  individual  ANG  State Headquarters or the Director, ANG. 2.3.  Pre-printed  Letterhead.  See  Figure  2.1  for  an  example  of  letterhead.    MAJCOMs  may elect  to  use  generic  two-line  command  letterhead  for  command-wide  use.    MAJCOMs  may authorize  letterhead  below  wing-level  if  the  quantity  needed  justifies  the  printing  cost  or  other circumstances  warrant.    Any  unit  without  its  own  letterhead  uses  its  parent  unit’s  letterhead stationery and identifies its organization and standard office symbol in the FROM caption. 2.3.1.  Ink.  Print the letterhead and seal using either Reflex Blue or black ink (see paragraph A2.2 for description of acceptable ink color). 2.3.2.  Seal.  The DoD seal is one inch in diameter.  Align the seal 1/2-inch from the upper left  and  top  edge  of  the  paper.    Do  not  use  any  other  emblem,  decorative  device,  or distinguishing insignia with or in place of the DoD seal. 8 AFMAN33-326  25 MAY 2017 2.3.3.  Format.  Center organization name and address on the letterhead using no more than four lines: 2.3.3.1.  First Line.  DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE.  Center this line leaving 5/8-inch  from  the  top  of  the  sheet.    Print  it  in  12  point  uppercase  using  copperplate  letters, heavy plate Gothic letters, or equivalent. 2.3.3.2.  Second Line.  Center the name of the organization listed in the G-series special order  that  established  it.    If  G-series  orders  do  not  exist,  the  MAJCOM  Director  of Communications  decides the organization’s  name  only  if  it  appears  in  the  activation  order.    Print  in  10.5  point uppercase using copperplate letters, heavy plate Gothic letters, or equivalent.  If the name is more than fifty characters, you may use an additional line.   Put  HEADQUARTERS  before the  second line. 2.3.3.3.  Third  Line.    If  used,  center  the  location  without  the  ZIP+4  code  on  this  line.  Print  in  10.5  point  uppercase  using  copperplate  letters,  heavy  plate  Gothic  letters,  or equivalent.    The  bottom  of  the  third  line  is  1  1/16  inches  from  the  top  of  the  sheet.    If your  unit  is  overseas,  do  not  show  the  Army  and  AF  Post  Office  (APO)  or  Fleet  Post Office (FPO) number and a geographical location together.  You may use the two letter state abbreviation or spell out the state name.  Do not use punctuation in the last line of the address element. EXAMPLES: DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-RANDOLPH TEXAS 2.3.4.  Optional  Items.    Fold  marks  are  guides  for  judging  typing  space  and  for  folding  the paper in three equal parts.  Typist guidelines show you are near the 1-inch bottom margin.  If used, print them in half-point rules (see Figure 2.1). 2.4.  Computer-Generated  Letterhead.  Computer-generated  letterhead  allows  for  the  use  of plain white paper and high production rates.  It also permits an organization to generate its own letterhead stationery. 2.4.1.  Use.  You may use computer-generated letterhead the same as printed letterhead when the  design  satisfies  all  specifications  in  paragraph  2.3.    Use  computer-generated  letterhead only  for  correspondence  within  the  DoD.    Do  not  use  for  the  signature  of  the  Secretary  or Deputy Secretary of Defense, or Executive Secretary of the DoD.  MAJCOMs may direct the use of printed letterhead for headquarters and subordinate units. 2.4.2.  Format.  When using computer-generated letterhead, you may identify the office name as  approved  in  organizational  designation  documents.

Do not use more than four lines for the letterhead. 2.5.  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF)  Letterhead.  HAF  offices  use  this  stationery,  as  do certain  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOA)  when  their  commanders  function  as  members  of  the HAF. 2.6.  DoD  Programs  and  Activities  Letterhead.  When  the  Department  of  the  Air  Force appointed the executive agent for DoD-directed programs (according to DoD Directive (DoDD) 5101.1,  DoD  Executive  Agent,  September  3,  2002,  DoD  Instruction  (DoDI)  5025.12, Standardization  of  Military  and  Associated  Terminology,  14  August  2009;  and  as  defined  in Joint  Publication  (JP)  1-02,  Department  of  Defense  Dictionary  of  Military  and  Associated Terms),  February  2017).    If  the  letterhead  format  is  similar  to  paragraph  2.3;  do  not  show DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE on the top line for DoD programs or joint activities. Use the layout listed for 2.6.1 and 2.6.2. 2.6.1.  First line.  Print the name of the program referenced in the DoD directive. 2.6.2.  Second  and  third  line.    Print  the  location.    For  further  guidance,  contact  SAF/CIO A6SS. EXAMPLES:  DOD MEDICAL EVALUATION REVIEW BOARD USAF ACADEMY COLORADO SPRINGS CO ARMED FORCES VOCATIONAL TESTING GROUP 456 ARMY DRIVE, ROOM 407 JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-RANDOLPH TX 78150-4567 2.7.  Slogans.  MAJCOMs  and FOAs may permit  use of slogans on official  memorandums and personalized letters that: 2.7.1.  Represent the mission of the organization. 2.7.2.  Be easy to understand. 2.7.3.  Not be offensive. 2.7.4.  Meet printing specifications (printed approximately 1/2-inch from bottom of page). 2.8.  Logograms  (Logos).  Do not  use the Department of the AF seal  on  stationery;  the proper use  of  the  Department  of  the  AF  seal  is  covered  in  Attachment  2.    DoDM  5110.04-M-V1 prohibits  use  of  logos,  emblems,  decorative  devices,  or  distinguishing  insignia  printed  or otherwise  on  stationery.    OSD  grants  waivers  only  for  programs  of  AF-wide  importance  and applicability, such as the AF Seventieth Anniversary.  Send waiver request to SAF/CIO A6 for staffing  to  OSD  through  the  Washington  Headquarters  Services  (WHS).    SAF/CIO  A6  (or delegated SAF/CIO A6 Office) prepares responses for requesting waiver decisions and returned decisions  to  the  requesting  office  for  further  action  or  distribution  as  applicable.    Use  existing logo stationery until supplies are exhausted. 10 AFMAN33-326  25 MAY 2017 Figure 2.1.

See AFH 33-337 for formatting of official memorandums. 3.2.  AF  Form  1768,  Staff  Summary  Sheet  (SSS).    Use  the  AF  Form  1768  or  a  similar electronic  version  to  summarize  staff  work,  to  request  action,  or  to  forward  information.    See AFH  33-337,  Chapter  18,  for  more  information  on  the  coordinating  and  staffing  packages  to includes,  SSS  fundamentals,  completing  the  SSS  Form  electronic  or  hard-copy,  package assembling, and coordination steps.  Follow local guidance for formatting electronic versions of the AF Form 1768 when applicable.  Coordination is as follows: 3.2.1.  When you agree with the proposed action, sign your surname, rank or grade or digital signature if applicable. 3.2.2.  When  you  do  not  agree  with  the  proposed  action,  write  a  memorandum  or  send  an official  Email  to  the  action  office  stating  your  reasons.    For  hard  copy  AF  Form  1768 coordination, write in ink “See Memorandum” in the signature column of the AF Form 1768 after your office symbol.  Attach your memorandum and return it to the action office.  This can be accomplished through Email if coordinating on an electronic AF Form 1768. 3.2.3.  Try  to  resolve  all  differences  when  you  receive  a  non-concurrence  on  an  AF  Form 1768. 3.2.4.  If  you  cannot  resolve  the  differences,  the  action  officer  needs  to  write  a  rebuttal memorandum  to  the  approval  authority  stating  the  differences  discussed  with  the  non-concurring official explaining why the proposed action was not changed.  Attach the rebuttal memorandum and the non-concurrence memorandum as the last tab to the original AF Form 1768,  and  annotate  in  pen  the  additional  tab  under  the  list  of  tabs.    Send  it  to  the  next addressee shown on the AF Form 1768.  If coordinating through electronic means, attach the differences to the package before forwarding to the approval authority. 3.2.5.  If  you  resolve  differences  and  no  changes  are  made  to  the  AF  Form  1768  or  to  any attachments,  the  previously  non-concurring  official  shows  concurrence  by  marking  through the statement “See Memorandum” and signing surname, rank or grade, and date.  The action officer  annotates  “Differences  resolved  and  no  changes  needed”  on  the  non-concurrence memorandum,  initials  the  statement,  and  attaches  this  memorandum  to  the  record  or coordination  copy.

These  are  models  of  a  memorandum  text  composed  in  advance, but  not  printed.    They  may  be  complete  memorandums  with  several  paragraphs  or  a  single paragraph.    Use  guide  memorandums  to  compose  official  memorandums.    Select  the combination of paragraphs appropriate for the reply. 4.2.  Form  Memorandums.  These  are  mass-produced  memos  sent  in  place  of  individually composed  or  typed  memorandums  when  many  individuals  require  similar  information  or  the same  individual  requires  the  information  at  frequent  intervals.    These  also  include  standard formats stored on electronic media that can be accessed, completed with optional data, and then printed or electronically forwarded. 4.2.1.  Types of Form Memorandums.  The three basic formats for form memorandums are prewritten, fill-in, and optional statement.  Prewritten form memorandums omit the receiver’s name, address,  and date.  Fill-in  form  memorandums  omit  any information that varies with each  response.    Optional  statement  form  memorandums  provide  several  options;  the  writer checks  the  statements  that  apply  to  the  specific  situation.    A  form  memorandum  may  have space for filling in information, selecting one of several statements, or both. 4.2.2.  Form Memorandums Use.  Use form memorandums when the subject matter and the action  are  routine  or  informational,  when  it  is  more  economical  to  duplicate  the memorandum  than  to  type  each  memorandum  individually,  and  when  the  printed  format expedites response from the recipient.  Do not use form memorandums if the subject is of a personal or congratulatory nature, if it may bring grief, disappointment, or embarrassment to the recipient, or if a numbered form would be better. 4.2.3.  Preparing and Controlling Form Memorandums. 4.2.3.1.  Justification.    Analyze  your  correspondence  for  a  2-week  period  and  group memorandums  that  are  similar  in  meaning  and  purpose.    Count  the  number  of individually typed memorandums for each group.  Refer to Table 4.1 when determining if a form memorandum is justified. Table 4.1.  Form Memorandum (Justified). The line count (text) of a repetitive memorandum is: And the number of similar memorandums written each month is:  5 10 15  30 or more 15 or more 10 or more 4.2.3.2.  Composition.    Follow  the  principles  of  writing  in  AFH  33-337.    Consider  the memorandum’s impact, especially if it is sent outside the AF.  If a memorandum collects information, review the requirements of the PL 104-13 and AFI 33-324. 14 AFMAN33-326  25 MAY 2017 4.2.3.3.  Design.    Leave  enough  blank  space  to  complete  a  fill-in  form  memorandum.  Align check boxes () on an optional statement form memorandum. 4.2.3.4.  Signature.    Sign  form  memorandums  individually  or  sign  the  master  before reproduction. 4.2.3.5.  Control.  Identify each form or guide memorandum by a different symbol if you have more than one, e.g. FM-1, FM-2, etc.  You may mark the memorandums themselves or their folders.  Review the need and currency of the memorandum before reproduction, and reproduce no more than a 3-month supply. 4.3.  Other  Written  Communication  Types.  For other written communications, see AFH 33-337 and DoDM 5110.04-M-V1. AFMAN33-326  25 MAY 2017 15 Chapter 5 USE OF ENVELOPES 5.1.  General  Information.  Use  standard  addresses  listed  in  USPS  Publication  28,  Postal Addressing Standards. 5.2.  Envelope Size. 5.2.1.  Use  a  rectangular  envelope  only  slightly  larger  than  the  correspondence.    Use envelopes that are no smaller than 3.5 by 5 inches and no larger than 6.125 by 11.5 inches. 5.2.2.  You  may  use  window  envelopes.    Be  sure  to  adjust  the  MEMORANDUM  FOR element to align the address with the envelope window. 5.2.3.  For  consolidated  mailing,  the  largest  item  that  cannot  be  folded  determines  the envelope  size  (see  DoD  Official  Mail  Manual,  Air  Force  Manual  33-306  (DoDM 4525.8_AFMAN 33-306). 5.3.  Addressing  the  Envelope.  For  successful  processing  by  Optical  Character  Recognition (OCR)  equipment,  the  USPS  requires  addresses  to  be  machine-printed,  with  a  uniform  left margin,  and  formatted  in  a  manner  that  allows  an  OCR  to  recognize  the  information.    Hand written addresses are acceptable when no other means are available. 5.3.1.  Printing.    Use  a  typewriter  or  print  addresses  on  a  laser  printer.    You  may  not  hand write or use rubber stamps unless laser printers and appropriate software are not available. 5.3.2.  Typeface.  Use Courier New font 12 or similar Simple Sans Serif.  Be sure characters are not too close together and do not touch or overlap.  Do not use bold, italic, script, or other unusual typefaces. 5.3.3.  Margins.  Leave margins at least 0.5-inch from the left and right edges of the envelope and at least 0.625-inch from the bottom of the envelope.  Limit the last line of the address to be no lower than 0.625-inch and no higher than 2.75 inches from the bottom of the envelope. 5.3.4.  Address Format.  See Figure 5.1 for address position and format.  Use block style with a  uniform  left  margin,  parallel  to  the  long  edge  of  the  envelope.    Single-space  the  address block and type the entire addresses in uppercase.  Use one or two spaces between words.  Do not use punctuation in the last two lines of the address block except for the dash in the ZIP+4 code.  Addresses are limited to five lines: 5.3.4.1.  Optional  Address  Data  Line.    Use  this  line  for  any  non-address  data  such  as account numbers, presort codes, or mail stop codes. 5.3.4.2.  Optional Attention Line.  Use this line to direct mail to a specific person. 5.3.4.3.  Organization  Abbreviation/Office  Symbol  Line. abbreviation and office symbol separated by a virgule.   Use the  organization 5.3.4.4.  Delivery  Address  Line.    Use  this  line  for  the  street  or  post  office  box  number, and  the  room  or  suite  number.    Use  authorized  USPS  abbreviations  found  in  USPS Publication  28.    Do  not  use  punctuation  on  this  line.    Delivery  addresses  may  be  hand printed (hand printed, no script) only when no automation or other methods of typing are available. 16 AFMAN33-326  25 MAY 2017 5.3.4.5.  City  or  Base,  State,  ZIP+4  Code  Line.    Use  the  two-letter  state  standard abbreviations  found  in  USPS  Publication  28.    Always  include  the  ZIP+4  code  in  the address.  Do not use commas between the city or base, abbreviation, and ZIP+4 code; the dash  in  the  ZIP+4  code  is  the  only  punctuation  used  in  the  last  address  line.    With overseas  addresses,  do  not  use  the  APO  or  FPO  number  and  geographical  location together; this causes the  mail  to  enter the international  mail  channels.   Do not  type any information below or to the right of the city, state, and ZIP+4 code address line. Figure 5.1.  Envelope Address Position and Format. 5.3.5.  Return  Address  Format.    Place  the  return  address  in  the  upper  left  corner  of  the envelope  (see  Figure  5.2).    Follow  the  address  format  (see  paragraph  5.3.4).    Use  the complete  mailing  address.    Type  “OFFICIAL  BUSINESS”  beneath  the  return  address  (see DoDM 4525.8_AFMAN 33-306).  Figure 5.2.  Printing Addresses and Return Addresses.  AFMAN33-326  25 MAY 2017 17 5.4.

The  top  part  bears  an  AF  yellow thunderbolt  with  flames  in  natural  color  that  shows  striking  power  through  the  use  of aerospace.    The  thunderbolt  consists  of  an  AF  yellow  vertical  twist  with  three  natural color flames on  each end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with  eight  lightning bolts.  The background of the top part is light blue representing the sky.  The lower part is white representing metal silver. A2.2.2.  The 13 white encircling stars represent the original 13 colonies. A2.2.3.  The  AF  yellow  numerals  under  the  shield  are  1947.    This  is  the  year  the  AF  was established. A2.2.4.  The  band  encircling  the  whole  design  is  white  edged  in  AF  yellow  with  black lettering.  The inscriptions  read “Department  of the Air Force” on the top  part and “United States of America” on the lower part. A2.3.  Using  the  Seal.
