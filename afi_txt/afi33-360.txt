Overview.  This publication establishes guidance and procedures for publications and forms management  Air  Force-wide.    Air  Force  units  at  all  levels  must  ensure  publications  and  forms are complete, accurate, current, and accessible to Air Force users. (T-1). 1.1.1.  Air Force publications (those listed in Table 4.1,  Table 4.2, and processed IAW this publication)  are  used  to  issue  Air  Force  policies,  guidance,  and  procedures;  they  serve  to inform and to assign responsibilities.  1.1.2.  Forms  provide  an  expanded  capability  to  standardize  and  manage  the  collection, storage, retrieval,  and display of data.   Official  forms  are processed and  disseminated  IAW this publication.  See Chapter 12 for complete details. 1.1.3.  Publications/Forms Processing. 1.1.3.1.  Draft  and  Collaborate.  The  process  entails  building  a  new  or  modifying  an existing  publication/form  and  obtaining  subject  matter  expert  (SME)  inputs.    See Chapter 3 and Chapter 6 for general guidance and detailed procedures. 1.1.3.2.  Coordinate.  Coordination of draft publications and forms is accomplished IAW Chapter 7 of this publication. 1.1.3.3.  Certify  and  Approve.  Obtain  senior  leaders’  certification  and  approval  to publish  as  policy,  guidance,  and/or  detailed  procedures.    See  Chapter  8  for  detailed procedures. 1.1.3.4.  Publish.  Publishing  is  addressed  throughout  publication  or  form  development; however,  it  does  not  formally  start  until  after  the  draft  has  been  officially  approved  for publishing  (AF  Form  673,  Air  Force  Publication/Form  Action  Request,  signed).    See Chapter  9  and  AFMAN  33-361,  Publishing  Processes  and  Procedures,  for  further guidance.  1.2.  Applicability of Publications and Forms. 1.2.1.  A  publication  or  form  applies  to  the  issuing  headquarters’  staff  elements  and  its subordinate activities (e.g., an “Air  Force”  Instruction [AFI] issued at  the Headquarters Air Force  [HAF]  applies  Air  Force-wide;  an  “AFMC”  Instruction  [AFMCI]  applies  only  to AFMC  and  units  subordinate  to  AFMC;  an  “AMC”  supplement  applies  only  to  AMC  and units subordinate to AMC).   1.2.2.  Generally, Air Force publications do not apply to non-US Air Force organizations or activities,  unless  authority  is  specified  in  the  publication.    Situations  include,  but  are  not limited locations,  host/tenant  relationships,  DoD  executive  agent designations, etc. joint  basing to: 1.2.3.  Exceptions: 1.2.3.1.  Support  Agreements,  Memoranda  of  Agreement  or  Understanding,  and  other legally  binding  documents  may  extend  applicability  at  the  operating  location  level (base/installation, joint bases, remote site, etc.). 8 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 1.2.3.2.  Lead Commands (AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapons Systems).  Lead Commands are advocates for specific weapon systems and as  such  respond  to  issues  addressing  their  status  and  use,  identify  Minimum  Essential System Listing items, and execute other responsibilities as detailed in AFPD 10-9.  1.2.3.2.1.  Lead Commands should work closely with HAF functionals to incorporate guidance  into  departmental  publications  (AFIs,  AFMANs,  etc.).    Lead  Commands may be the OPR for a departmental publication; as a departmental publication OPR, maintain  the  guidance  publication  and  coordinate  it  with  affected  commands.  However,  they  must  be  issued  as  departmental  publications  and  be  certified  and approved from the HAF.  1.2.3.2.2.  Lead  Commands  may  issue  guidance  to  affected  commands  within  the scope  of  the  Lead  Commands’  assigned  responsibilities  and  authorities.    However, The  OPRs  for  Lead  Command  publications  should  work  together  to  deconflict guidance when directing units/shops that support more than one Lead Command.   1.3.  Validity of a Publication or Form. 1.3.1.  Certifying and approving officials for Air Force publications and forms must be either military  members  or  civilian  employees  (including  direct-hire  foreign  nationals,  but  not including contractors or indirect-hire foreign nationals). (T-0).  1.3.2.  When  an  approving  official  vacates  his  or  her  position,  publications  showing  the individual’s signature element remain in effect until rescinded or rewritten.  1.3.3.  When  a  unit  reorganizes,  OPRs  should  revise  publications  to  reflect  the  new organization  designation  as  soon  as  possible.    As  a  temporary  measure,  while  a  rewrite  or new publication action is being processed, OPRs may process/post administrative changes to the front of the publication(s) that notifies readers of the unit designation change.  However, current publications and forms remain valid and in effect until superseded or rescinded.  1.4.  Accessibility of Publications and Forms. 1.4.1.  Ultimately,  publishing  operations  are  designed  to  provide  customers  access  to electronic  and/or  physical  publications  and  forms.    The  e-Publishing  web  site  (www.e-publishing.af.mil)  serves  as  the  official  repository  for  departmental,  command,  and  field publications and forms  that  are issued at  the wing/base and above (excluding ANG wings).  The  e-Publishing  web  site  is  open  to  the  public,  so  only  the  unclassified  titles  of  classified and  restricted  access  products  are  provided,  along  with  directions  for  accessing  restricted web sites, and/or instructions on how to obtain copies from the OPR. 1.4.2.  The Warehouse Management System-BackOffice-Air Force Information Management Publishing  Tool  (WMS-BO-AFIMPT)  is  a  web  application  that  provides  tracking  and delivery  of  new  or  revised  wing/base  and  above  (excluding  ANG  wings)  publications  and forms to the Air Force Departmental Publishing Office (AFDPO).  The application provides OPRs/POCs,  publication  change  managers  (PCM),  publications  and  forms  managers,  and AFDPO the ability to change product metadata details, upload draft versions and supporting documents,  submit  for  publishing,  track  submission,  and  disseminate  the  new  or  revised electronic  publications  and  forms  to  customers  via  the  e-Publishing  web  site  or  WMS modules  ordering  function.    The  web  application  does  not  include  a  workflow  for AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 9 coordination, certification, or approval of drafts (use other workflow tools).  The application is  sometimes  referred  to  individually  by  its  parts  (WMS,  BO,  AFIMPT),  but  they  are interlinked  and  managed  as  a  single  web  application.   The  link  to  AFIMPT  is https://wmsweb.afncr.af.mil/afimpt/ 1.4.3.  Local publications managers or OPRs will make publications and forms not supported by the AFDPO available on local web sites or through physical distribution. (T-3). 1.5.  Effective  Dates.  The  publication  date  is  the  effective  date  of  the  policy  or  guidance  (see Exception  below);  Air  Force  publications,  to  include  Air  Force  Policy  Memoranda  and Guidance  Memoranda,  are  not  considered  effective  until  they  are  released  to  users  IAW  this publication.  (T-1).    The  publishing  activity  (AFDPO  for  e-Publishing,  Publication  Manager  or OPR  in  instances  when  local  web  sites  are  used)  adds  the  date  to  the  publication  to  reflect  the day the publication is actually released to users (placed on formal web site or made available for ordering).  The date the approving official signs the AF Form 673 may not be the effective date shown on the publication.   Exception:  Entire publications or portions  therein,  may have  future effective  dates  that  allow  units/personnel  time  to  prepare  for  compliance.    The  future  effective date/timeframe must be identified in the opening paragraph and specific portions (if appropriate) of the publication.  1.6.  Delegations and Requirements in Air Force Publications.  Air Force publications should not impose overly restrictive delegations or requirements.  Air Force publications should: 1.6.1.  Not  overly  restrict  delegation  of  authority.    If  a  publication  or  related  laws  or directives do not state that they must personally take certain actions, the commander/director may delegate the authority to take the action.  Only impose restrictions when there is a legal, financial, or other reason for the commander (or other official) to act personally.  Use phrases such as "the commander/director (vice commander or other official) must personally," or "the commander/director may not delegate this authority," to restrict delegation. 1.6.2.  Not impose unnecessarily broad tasking or requirements on activities and installations.  Such  tasking  may  create  hardships  at  geographically  separated  units  and  remote  locations with a small staff.   If some units (or none at all) need not comply with some requirements, particularly those that create committees or boards, state these exceptions in the publication. 1.6.3.  Not  specify  performing  the  function  as  an  additional  duty,  or  require  that  a  military member of a certain minimum grade or within a range of grades perform a duty, unless legal requirements or other DoD or Air Force publications require such restrictions.  Commanders should be allowed to manage essential functions, assign additional duties, and decide which and how personnel are used to accomplish their duties. 1.6.4.  Not  specify  additional  workload  or  financial  obligations  which  would  require manpower  or  financial  resources  that  have  not  been  approved  or  vetted  by  higher headquarters or the Air Force Corporate Structure.  1.7.  Punitive Language. 1.7.1.  Punitive  Enforceability  of  Publications  Enforced  under  Article  92(1)  of  the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  1.7.1.1.  The  absence  of  “punitive”  language  in  a  paragraph  of  a  publication  does  not mean compliance is optional,  or that  a military  member or civilian  employee  cannot  be 10 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 disciplined  for  violating  non-punitive  requirements  in  a  publication.    All  Air  Force personnel  must  comply  with  both  punitive  and  non-punitive  mandatory  guidance  in publications.  (T-1).    Rather,  punitive  language  in  a  publication  means  that  a  military member  may  be  found  to  have  violated  Article  92(1)  of  the  UCMJ  regardless  of  their knowledge  of  the  requirements  established  by  the  publication.    In  some  instances,  a publication OPR may decide the matter discussed in a publication is of such consequence that  failure  to  adhere  to  its  proscriptions  or  mandates  should  be  specifically  punishable under Article 92(1).  But, punitive language in publications should be used sparingly and only for the most significant and serious matters.   1.7.1.2.  Publication  OPRs  must  include  specific  enforceability  language  directing compliance  by  military  personnel,  in  opening  paragraphs  of  publications,  including  a description  of  the  consequences  of  non-compliance  statement  identifying  the  relevant provision as punitive for purposes of Article 92(1) of the UCMJ, for violation by military members  of  specific  sections  or  paragraphs  of  a  publication  to  be  punishable  under Article  92(1)  of  the  UCMJ.  (T-1).    Include  this  same  language  in  the  specific  punitive paragraph(s) (or sections) of the publication.  1.7.1.3.  Article 92(1) of the UCMJ does not apply to the members of the ANG while in Title  32  status,  but  they  may  be  subject  to  an  equivalent  article  under  a  state  military justice code.  1.7.2.  Making  Language  in  a  Publication  Punitive  under  Article  92(1).    To  be  lawful, punitive  language  in  a  publication  should  be  reasonably  in  furtherance  of,  or  connected  to, military  needs.    For  example;  promotes  reasonably  necessary  to  accomplish  a  military mission or safeguard and protect morale, discipline, and usefulness of command and directly connected  to  the  maintenance  of  good  order;  specific  as  to  time  and  place,  as  applicable; definite  and  certain  in  describing  the  act  or  thing  to  do  or  omit  avoid;  and    not  otherwise contrary  to  established  law.    Mandatory  provisions  place  an  affirmative  duty  upon  the individual to do a certain act (e.g. lock a safe, follow a checklist, wear certain items, attend certain formations, etc.).  Prohibitory provisions require that an individual not do something (e.g. enter a classified area, wear prohibited uniform combinations, drive in excess of a stated speed, etc.).  Publication OPRs must send all proposed punitive publications to the servicing legal office for review before issuance. (T-1). 1.7.3.  Structure of a Publication Containing Punitive Paragraphs. 1.7.3.1.  Publication OPRs must ensure the opening paragraph of the publication specifies which  paragraphs  (or  sections)  in  the  publication  contain  punitive  provisions  that  are enforceable under Article 92(1) of the UCMJ.  A military member should be able to tell by looking at the introduction of the publication that it contains punitive provisions. (T-1). 1.7.3.2.  The language standing alone in the opening paragraph does not by itself make a publication  punitive;  it  becomes  punitive  when  combined  with  the  punitive  language  in the identified specific paragraphs or sections of the publication.  1.7.3.3.  Accordingly,  publication  OPRs  must  ensure  the  opening  paragraph  states  that “Failure to observe the prohibitions and mandatory provisions in paragraphs (or section) AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 11 xxxx of this publication by military members is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ,” or similar language. (T-1). 1.7.4.  Punitive  Language  in  Specific  Paragraphs/Sections.  In  the  punitive  paragraph  or section itself, use language that expresses the mandatory nature of the provision(s), such as “will,”  “will  not,”  “shall,”  “shall  not,”  “  must,”  “must  not,”  etc.    State  that  a  “Failure  by military  members  to  obey  (the  mandatory  provisions  in  this  paragraph  (or  section))  is  a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ,” or similar language, in the paragraphs or sections that contain  these  mandatory  provisions  or  prohibitions.    This  statement  may  accompany  each mandatory  provision  or  prohibition  of  the  punitive  paragraph  or  section,  or  may  refer  to  a series  of  mandatory  provisions  or  prohibitions  listed  within  a  specific  paragraph,  but  must clearly identify the mandatory provisions or prohibitions to which it applies. 1.8.  Conflicting Publications. 1.8.1.  Guidance  in  departmental  level  publications  (AFIs,  AFMANs)  take  precedence  over guidance  in  command  and  field  level  publications,  unless  the  directing  departmental  office agrees  to  the  exception/deviation  identified  in  the  lower  level  publication.    The  agreement must  be  cited  in  the  lower  publication;  see  paragraph    12.10.2  for  an  example  of  such  an agreement.  1.8.2.  Guidance  in  HHQ  publications  take  precedence  over  guidance  in  lower  level publications, unless the directing HHQ office agrees to the exception/deviation identified in the lower level publication.  The agreement must be cited in the lower publication.  1.8.3.  When  publications  are  found  to  be  less  restrictive  or  conflict  with  higher  level publications,  consider  submitting  an  AF  Form  847  to  the  publication(s)  OPR  following  the appropriate  chain  of  command.    See  Attachment  6  for  instructions  on  submitting  an  AF Form 847.  1.8.4.  When notified of a conflict, the affected publication OPRs/POCs will work together to determine  appropriate  guidance  changes  to  rectify/de-conflict  the  guidance  and  reissue corrected  publication(s).  (T-2).    Courses  of  action  for  OPRs  to  deconflict  include  issuing  a waiver, GM, IC, rewrite, and/or recession of the publication(s).  1.9.  Waivers.  When  unable  to  comply  with  official  policy,  guidance,  and/or  procedures,  the unit may request a waiver.   1.9.1.  The  fundamental  aim  of  a  waiver  is  to  enhance  mission  effectiveness  at  all  levels, while preserving resources and safeguarding health and welfare.  A waiver is a method for a commander  to  communicate  a  risk  management  decision  for  a  specified  time  period  or circumstance in which: 1.9.1.1.  The  cost  of  compliance  (training,  funds,  equipment,  facilities,  guidance  or manpower) creates unacceptable risk to a higher priority task; OR 1.9.1.2.  The expected cost of compliance outweighs the benefit; OR 1.9.1.3.  Personnel  cannot  comply  with  the  requirement  due  to  a  lack  of  resources (training, funds, equipment, facilities, guidance or manpower). 1.9.2.  When  a  commander  approves  a  waiver,  the  commander  is  communicating  to subordinates and superiors that the commander accepts the risk created by non-compliance.  12 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 1.9.3.  Waiver Approval Authorities. 1.9.3.1.  The default waiver approval authority for compliance items not identified with a tier  number  or  an  office  specifically  identified/delegated  to  approve  waivers  (in  any publication),  is  the  approving  official  that  released  the  specific  publication.    The approving  official  may  delegate subordinate office/organization,  but  must  specifically  state  this  in  the  publication.    For  example, SAF/AA  has  delegated  the  waiver  approval  authority  for  compliance  items  in  this publication to SAF/AAII Policy Branch at paragraph  1.9.5 and paragraph  2.3.1.3.4 the  approval  authority to  a 1.9.3.2.  Assigning  Wing  or  equivalent,  DRU,  or  FOA  Tiered  Waiver  Approval Authority.  1.9.3.2.1.  All  compliance  statements  in  departmental,  MAJCOM,  FOA,  and  NAF directive publications (Table 4.1) that direct actions at or below a subordinate wing or equivalent, DRU, or FOA must include a tiered waiver approval authority number.  Exception: AFPDs will not be tiered. 1.9.3.2.2.  While  considering  the  need  for  standardization/conformity  across  the  Air Force, publication OPRs will use Table 1.1 to determine the appropriate tier waiver number to apply.   1.9.3.2.3.  Publication OPRs must include a tier waiver authority number immediately following each compliance statement that direct action at or below a subordinate wing or equivalent, DRU, or FOA. (T-1).  Blanket/global tier waiver number assignments at the beginning of the publication or section are not allowed.   1.9.3.3.  Compliance  statements  targeting  units  above  the  wing,  DRU,  or  FOA  (e.g.: MAJCOM,  NAF,  etc.)  are  not  required  to  be  tiered  (referred  to  as  non-tiered).    The opening  paragraph  of  the  publication  will  include  a  statement  that  identifies  how  these waiver requests will be processed (see paragraph  6.5.6.7 for waiver statement examples).  However, when they are tiered, the commander at or above the identified tiered approval level may also approve a waiver for their unit.  For example, a compliance statement that is targeting “MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, wing” that has a “T-3” designation for Wing, FOA, DRU  commander  approval  level,  in  this  context,  a  waiver  may  also  be  approved  by  a MAJCOM commander for the MAJCOM Staff.

A member must always be informed of the identity of the commander who will actually make the findings and punishment decisions before a decision is required as to whether to accept nonjudicial punishment or demand court-martial. (T-0).  b. AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System, 2.4.1.1. IAW 10 USC § 8583 and AFI 1-2, Commander’s Responsibilities, commanders will conduct Internal Inspections and actively support and participate in External Inspections affecting their unit(s). (T-0). Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders, or the USAF strongly at risk of mission or program failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or fraud, waste or abuse.  Examples: a. AFI 90-201, 2.4.1.2. Commanders are responsible for ensuring compliance within their units. Commanders will ensure their CCIP focuses on detecting non-compliance with all applicable governing directives and on unit effectiveness in the four MGAs in Figure 2.2. (T-1).

ISO (Information System Owner) and PM (Program Manager) shall review PIAs annually (T-1).  Non-compliance may degrade mission or program effectiveness or efficiency and has potential to create moderate risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or fraud, waste or abuse.  Examples: a. AFI 90-201, 2.9.1. Gatekeeper. Gatekeepers at all levels must ensure the inspection system is able to independently and efficiently inspect units on behalf of the command chain. (T-2).  b. AFI 33-396, Knowledge Management, 4.2.1.1. Focal Point for EIS (Enterprise Information Services) and Collaborative Technologies. For any supported unit, the KMC (Knowledge Management Center) will be the point of contact for EIS, AF Portal, and commercial collaborative products that are not tied to a specific functional community. (T-2). 15 And Risk is Assumed by the: Wing, FOA, or DRU Commander AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 May be used Tier in Number publications If, Consequence of Non-Compliance Or, Then, the Waiver Authority is: Requesting units’ Wing/DRU/FOA/CC(delegable no lower than Group/CC or equivalent)  Conformity is needed across the Air Force, but commander’s may decide to deviate from standard practices T-3 at Departmental, MAJCOM, FOA, and NAF levels Non-compliance may limit mission or program effectiveness or efficiency and has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or fraud, waste or abuse. Examples: a. AFI 90-201, 5.6.2. The Wing CIMB (Commander’s Inspection Management Board) will meet monthly (quarterly for ARC). (T-3).  b. AFI 33-396, 4.2.2.7. Apply Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) Principles. The KMC will have foundational training in CPI methodologies, such as AFSO 21 and DoD CPI/Lean Six Sigma (LSS). (T-3). Note:   1 - For purposes of waiver approval authority for units assigned to a combatant command, the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) is considered a MAJCOM/CC equivalent. 2 – Tiering is for identifying subordinate level commanders’ authority to approve waivers; do not use a tier number that reflects the same level as the organization that issued the publication.  For example, it is redundant to identify a T-3 (Wing/CC) in a Wing publication, given that the default approval authority for the waiver is the Wing/CC since they approved the publication.  1.9.4.  Waiver Process and Limitations. 1.9.4.1.  Commanders  or  civilian  directors  must  submit  written  waiver  requests  seeking relief from compliance through the command chain up to one of the below (in the order listed): (T-1). 1.9.4.1.1.  The  appropriate  tier  waiver  approval  authority  (T-0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3),  if identified. (T-1). 1.9.4.1.2.  The  specific  office/official  with  waiver  authority  as  identified/directed  in the specific publication’s text, if a non-tiered item. (T-1). 1.9.4.1.3.  The  publication  approving  official,  through  the  publication  OPR,  if  non-tiered and the publication does not specify (default). (T-1). 16 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 1.9.4.2.  Waiver  requests  will  be  submitted  using  the  AF  Form  679,  Air  Force Publication Compliance Item Waiver Request/Approval, or via e-mail or memorandum if the form is unavailable. (T-1).  The request includes the following: 1.9.4.2.1.  Reference  and commander/director is requesting a waiver. (T-1). text  of the  specific requirement for  which the 1.9.4.2.2.  Rationale  for  the  waiver:    Explain  which  of  the  3  reasons  listed  under paragraph  1.9.1 apply and describe why. (T-1). 1.9.4.2.3.  Time period or circumstance the waiver is needed. (T-1). 1.9.4.2.4.  Risk  mitigation  measures  to  be  implemented,  if  necessary,  by  the requesting commander during the waiver period. (T-1). 1.9.4.2.5.  Impact if waiver is disapproved. (T-1). 1.9.4.3.  Approval/denial  of  waiver  requests  should  be  returned  within  30  days  of submission  by  the  requesting  commander;  denials  should  include  a  brief  explanation.  The effective period for a waiver starts when it is approved, not when it is submitted.   1.9.4.3.1.  The  approval  authority  may  disapprove  or  approve  the  waiver  in  its entirety, or modify the waiver request as he/she sees fit. 1.9.4.3.2.  Commanders exercising their authority to waive an Air Force requirement must document their decision in writing or electronic record copy. (T-2).  1.9.4.3.3.  Waiver Period. 1.9.4.3.3.1.  Tier 1, 2, and 3 waivers may be approved for a period not to exceed the requested waiver period or 30 calendar days after the approving commander’s tour  length,  whichever  is  shorter.    Because  waivers  are  the  expression  of  a specific commander accepting risk, Tier 1, 2, and 3 waivers automatically expire 30  days  after  a  change  of  command  unless  the  new  commander  renews  the waiver. 1.9.4.3.3.2.  Waivers issued for non-tiered compliance items are limited based on the  approver’s  determination  and  the  waiver  period  is  identified  in  the  approval message. 1.9.4.3.3.3.  Waivers may be established in publications, but the publishing action package  and  official  record  set  must  include  the  signed  waiver  approval.    The waiver  approval  must  be  renewed  by  the  new  commander  no  later  than  30  days after  a  change  of  command.  (T-1).    Otherwise  the  waiver  is  invalid  and  the publication must be revised or rescinded. (T-1)  1.9.4.3.4.  Approved  waivers  become  part  of  the  approver’s  and  requestor’s  official records and must be appropriately filed IAW AFMAN 33-363.  A copy of approved waivers  must  also  be  sent  to  the  OPR  of  the  HHQ  publication  being  waived;  for situational awareness and process improvement considerations. (T-1).   1.9.4.4.  During the waiver period, the requesting commander/director will: 1.9.4.4.1.  Implement approved risk controls to reduce, mitigate or eliminate the risk created by non-compliance. (T-2). AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 17 1.9.4.4.2.  Actively work toward compliance by reducing the cost of compliance and remedying resource shortfalls (if applicable). (T-2). 1.9.4.4.3.  Re-evaluate  risk  throughout  the  waiver  period  and  adjust  risk  controls  as necessary. 1.9.4.4.4.  Each  commander/director  will  keep,  at  a  minimum, commander’s/director’s waivers on file. (T-2). the  previous 1.9.5.  Waiver requests for this publication (AFI 33-360).  SAF/AAII Policy Branch is the waiver approving authority for non-tiered requirements in this publication.  Include a copy of any  waivers  or  exceptions  issued  regarding  the  publications  and  forms  management requirements found in this publication when submitting products to AFDPO for publishing. 1.10.  Unauthorized Changes to Publications.  Rewrites or changes that are not processed IAW guidance  in  this  publication  create  confusion  and  conflicting  guidance  that  could  jeopardize mission accomplishment and safety.  When an activity receives a revised publication or notice of a  change  issued  by  methods  other  than  those  prescribed  in  this  publication,  they  should immediately  notify  the  OPR  for  the  publication  and  the  appropriate  (PM/FM)  by  e-mail  or memorandum.    The  PM/FM  should  immediately  contact  the  OPRs  to  establish  a  corrective course of action.  The OPR ensures the unauthorized change is reprocessed in accordance with the guidance contained in this publication and any suspense date provided by the PM/FM. 1.11.  Draft  publications  are  not  for  implementation  or  compliance.  Publications  are considered drafts until they have been certified, approved, and processed IAW this publication.  Mark  draft  documents/material  to  clearly  indicate  that  material  is  for  informational  or  review purposes  only  and  is  not  for  implementation  or  compliance  (see  paragraph    6.5.1  on  marking drafts). 1.12.

OPRs  ensure  all  Air  Force  publications  that  authorize  collecting  information internal or external to the Air Force comply with the guidance provided in AFI 33-324, The  Air  Force  Information  Collections  and  Reports  Management  Program,  which implements the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. 1.12.1.2.  The Air Force shall limit the publication and printing of hard copy documents and  convert  existing/provide  information  in  an  electronic  format,  whenever  practicable, permitted by law, and consistent with applicable records retention requirements. (T-2). 1.12.2.  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  (DoD  Directive  [DoDD]  5400.07,  DoD Freedom of Information Act [FOIA] Program).  Federal  statute, DoD and Air Force policy require prompt and accurate disclosure of information to the public.  A FOIA specialist must review  Air  Force  publications  prior  to  publication  to  ensure  compliance  with  FOIA requirements.    Refer  to  DoD  5400.7-R_AFMAN33-302,  Freedom  of  Information  Act Program, for additional guidance and procedures. 18 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 1.12.3.

Determining  Applicability  of  Departmental  Publications  to  Air  Force  Reserve Command (AFRC) Units and Personnel. 1.13.1.  OPRs  send  all  new  or  rewritten  departmental  publications,  which  are  applicable  to the AFRC, to AF/RE prior to publishing. 1.13.2.  Electronic  coordination  may  be  obtained  by  submitting  the  draft  publication  to  the Chief of Air Force Reserve (AF/RE) workflow e-mail inbox (afrc.reworkflow@us.af.mil).  The  primary  POC  within  AF/RE  is  responsible  for  obtaining  coordination  from  other interested staff offices within AF/RE.  Like all other coordinating offices, if the publication OPR  does  not  receive  a  response  or  request  for  extension  prior  to  the  suspense  date (minimum of two weeks), the OPR may annotate the coordination response as “Concur – No Response” and move on.  The OPR of the publication includes a statement of applicability in the opening paragraph of the draft.  AF/RE either concurs with the OPR’s chosen statement of  applicability  or  supplies  a  new  statement.    As  the  Air  Force  moves  closer  to  total  force functioning,  publications  should  be  written  to  support  the  functioning  of  all  types  of  Air Force  employees/members,  including  Reserve  forces.    However,  when  AF/RE  takes exception  (by  providing  a  Critical  comment)  to  specific  portions  of  a  publication  due  to dissimilarities with the way AFRC units operate, the OPR is not to publish it until all critical comments are resolved.  OPRs require justification from AF/RE when exceptions are taken.  Send unresolved issues to the appropriate Secretariat or Air Staff office for resolution, IAW AFI 10-301, Responsibilities of Air Reserve Component (ARC) Forces. 1.13.3.  Statements of applicability are as follows: 1.13.3.1.  When  the  entire  publication  applies,  include  the  following  statement:  “This publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units.” 1.13.3.2.  When  only  specific  portions  apply,  include  a  statement  such  as  “Chapter  (or paragraph—include  specific  number[s])  of  this  publication  apply  to  Air  Force  Reserve Command (AFRC) Units.” 20 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 1.13.3.3.  When  only  specific  portions  do  not  apply  include  a  statement  such  as  “This publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units, with the exception of (list the portions that do not apply).” 1.13.3.4.  If the entire publication does not apply, include the following statement: “This publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units.” 1.13.4.  OPRs must re-coordinate with AF/RE if changes to the publication are made during coordination that may affect the applicability to reserve units. 1.13.5.  AF/RE or AFRC units must submit an AF Form 847 to the OPR of the publication if changes to the applicable publication occur after release that affect the applicability status of the publication. 1.13.6.  OPR  must  comply  when  a  request  to  change  the  applicability  statement  within  a publication is received from AF/RE or AFRC. 1.14.  Determining Applicability of MAJCOM Publications to AFRC Units and Personnel. 1.14.1.  OPRs  send  all  new  and  rewritten  MAJCOM  publications  that  are  applicable  to  an AFRC unit to that unit for review prior to publishing. 1.14.2.  Electronic  coordination  may  be  obtained  by  submitting  the  draft  publication  to  the HQ  AFRC  Tasker  Workflow  organizational  account  (afrc.ccx2@us.af.mil).    HQ  AFRC CCX will in turn task the applicable HQ staff office.  Like all other coordinating offices, if the  publication  OPR  does  not  receive  a  response  or  request  for  extension  prior  to  the suspense date (minimum of two weeks), the OPR may annotate the coordination response as “Concur  –  No  Response”  and  move  on.    The  OPR  of  the  publication  must  include  a statement of applicability in the opening paragraph of the draft.  AFRC either concurs  with the OPR’s chosen statement of applicability (selected from statements provided in paragraph  1.13.1.1 through paragraph  1.13.1.4) or supplies a new statement.   Note: As the Air Force moves  closer  to  total  force  functioning,  publications  should  be  written  to  support  the functioning  of  all  types  of  Air  Force  employees/members,  including  Reserve  forces.  However,  when  the  AFRC  takes  exception  to  specific  portions  of  a  publication  due  to dissimilarities  with  the  way  AFRC  operates,  they  provide  appropriate  comments  during coordination  and  the  OPR  does  not  publish  the  document  until  all  exceptions/critical comments are resolved.  AFRC provides adequate justification for critical comments.  Send unresolved issues to  the  appropriate Secretariat or Air Staff office  for resolution,  IAW AFI 10-301. 1.14.3.  OPRs must re-coordinate with AFRC if changes to the publication are made during coordination that may affect the applicability to reserve units. 1.14.4.  AFRC or AFRC units must submit an AF Form 847 to the OPR of the publication if changes to the applicable publication occur after release that affect the applicability status of the publication. 1.14.5.  OPR  must  comply  when  a  request  to  change  the  applicability  statement  within  a publication is received from AFRC. 1.15.  Determining Applicability of Publications Issued Below the MAJCOM level to AFRC Units  and  Personnel.  OPRs  must  coordinate  with  local  AFRC  unit  when  the  publication  is applicable to the local or inherited AFRC unit. (T-3). AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 21 1.16.  Determining Applicability of Departmental, Command, and Field Publications to the Air National Guard (ANG): 1.16.1.  OPRs send all new or rewritten departmental publications that are applicable to  the ANG, to NGB/A6CK prior to publishing. (T-2). 1.16.1.1.  The  Chief  of  the  National  Guard  Bureau  (CNGB)  authorized  the  NGB/CF (considered  the  ANG  two-letter)  to  review  and  approve  ANG  publications  without additional  NGB  review  (AFI  10-301).  Exception:  The  CNGB  will  review  and  approve all Interservice Publications that are applicable to the NGB; however, the process for Air Force OPRs remains the same. 1.16.1.2.  All  publications  are  submitted  to  ANG  Workflow:  usaf.jbanafw.ngb-cf.mbx.ang-workflow@mail.mil usaf.jbanafw.ngb-cc.mbx.taskers@mail.smil.mil  (SIPR),  or  ANG  Workflow  in  HAF  TMT;  NGB/A6CK will  ensure  Air  Force  and  Interservice  publications  are  disseminated  to  the  appropriate reviewers within ANG/NGB.  Like all other coordinating offices, if the publication OPR does not receive a response or request for extension prior to the suspense date (minimum of  two  weeks),  the  OPR  may  annotate  the  coordination  response  as  “Concur  –  No Response” and move on. (NIPR), 1.16.2.  The AF OPR of the publication includes a statement of applicability in  the opening paragraph  of  the  draft.    NGB/CF  either  concurs  with  the  OPR’s  chosen  statement  of applicability  or  supplies  a  new  statement.    As  the  Air  Force  moves  closer  to  total  force functioning,  publications  should  be  written  to  support  the  functioning  of  all  types  of  Air Force  members,  including  ANG  forces.    However,  when  the  NGB/CF  takes  exception  to specific  portions  of  a  publication  due  to  dissimilarities  with  the  way  ANG  operates,  the NGB/CF  provides  applicability  or  exception  statements  to  the  OPR  of  the  publication  for inclusion  in  the  opening  paragraph.    OPRs  require  justification  from  the  NGB/CF  when exceptions  are  taken.    Examples  of  opening  paragraph  statements  are:  “This  publication applies  to  the  Air  National  Guard  (ANG),”  “This  publication  does  not  apply  to  the  Air National Guard (ANG),” or “This publication applies to the Air National Guard (ANG) only upon mobilization.” 1.16.3.  When  an  existing  ANG  and  an  applicable  departmental  or  MAJCOM  publication conflict,  the  ANG  publication  governs  until  the  OPR  and  appropriate  ANG  official  resolve the  conflict.    Resolve  conflicts  at  the  MAJCOM-level  by  including  either  an  ANG-specific chapter or publishing a replacement ANG publication. 1.16.4.  ANG may publish a separate publication if there are numerous exceptions, additions, or  inclusions  to  a  proposed  publication.    ANG  publishes  supplements  identified  as  ANG supplements  to  both  departmental  and  MAJCOM  publications,  using  the  same  numerical designation as the parent publication. 1.17.  Determining Applicability of Departmental and MAJCOM Publications  to the Civil Air  Patrol  (CAP).  The CAP is the volunteer civilian Auxiliary of the United States Air Force (USAF).    As  the  Air  Force  Auxiliary,  CAP  performs  Air  Force  missions  as  approved  through AFPD  10-27,  Civil  Air  Patrol,  and  AFI  10-2701,  Organization  and  Function  of  the  Civil  Air Patrol.  As the Air Force moves closer to total force functioning, publications should be written to  support  the  functioning  that  includes  the  Air  Force  Auxiliary,  as  appropriate.    Approval  of 22 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 policies and procedures affecting the CAP/Air Force Auxiliary, including non-combat missions follows the normal chain of command. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 23 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

That  individual  will  meet  all  OPR  responsibilities,  although  the organization  retains  ultimate  responsibility.  (T-3).    Note:  If  the  POC  is  a  contractor employee/indirect foreign hire, final decisions concerning Air Force policy/guidance must be made by an appropriate civilian or military employee within the OPR.  2.9.2.  The POC consults with the appropriate PCM and publications and forms management office  before  developing  a  publication  and/or  form  and  at  any  point  during  the  publishing process for guidance/advice.  Adheres to publishing guidance and requirements contained in this publication. 2.9.3.  The  POC  collaborates  with  the  PCM  to  identify  required  coordinating  offices  and staffs publishing product with those organizations (see Attachment 3).  2.9.3.1.  The  POC,  as  approved  by  the  OPR  (civilian  employee/military  member) resolves  all  critical  comments  before  the  publication  or  form  is  submitted  for  final processing and publishing.  The POC provides the resolution statements for all comments submitted during coordination.  2.9.3.2.  If the AF Form 673 or the AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet (SSS), contains coordination more than one year old and no significant changes to the draft contents have been made, POCs state on the AF Form 673 that no re-coordination is necessary before the  certifying  and  approval  officials  sign  the  form.    The  POC  re-accomplishes coordination if significant changes have been made. 2.9.4.  Based on the guidance in AFI 16-1404, Air Force Information Security Program, the POC, in collaboration with the PCM, recommends a level of accessibility for the publication: post  on  the  e-Publishing  web  site  (a  public  site)  or  restrict  access  (see  paragraph    6.5.5.7).  Classified  and  CUI  publications  are  not  automatically  scheduled  for  printing;  discuss production alternatives  with  the PM/FM if a printed product  is  required.  Only unclassified titles  for  departmental,  command,  and  field  generated  CUI  and  classified  publications  are included in the Product Index and/or in the publications listing on the e-Publishing web site. 2.9.5.  The  POC  keeps  existing  publications  and  prescribed  forms  current.    Submits publications action requests to  the PM/FM on the AF Form  673 after obtaining appropriate coordination, certification and approval. 2.9.6.  The  POC  informs  designated  PM/FM  when  transferring  responsibility  for  a publication or form to another organization (see paragraph  5.7). 2.9.7.  The  POC  maintains  official  record  sets  for  publications  and  forms  IAW  paragraph  2.7,  2.8, and Chapter 10. 2.9.8.  The  POC  ensures  the  proposed  publication  does  not  conflict  with  or  unnecessarily duplicate higher headquarters policies or procedures. 2.9.9.  The  POC  responds  to  questions  related  to  the  publication  or  form,  and  evaluates proposed changes to the publication or form.  AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 31 2.9.10.  The  POC  receives,  evaluates,  and  staffs  waiver  requests,  elevating  within  the organization for review and approval as necessary.  2.9.11.  The OPR/POC involves stakeholders/coordinating offices early in the process to help facilitate efficient formal coordination.   2.9.12.  Ensures appropriate tier waiver authority is identified in publications and SACs. 2.9.13.  Accesses  AFIMPT  (https://wmsweb.afncr.af.mil/afimpt/)  and  ensures  contact information is current. 2.10.  Certifying Officials.  Certify, for the approving official, 1) the need for the publication or form within the numbered publication subject series and 2) its consistency with Air Force policy and  assigned  responsibilities  in  antecedent  AFPD  and/or  implemented  HHQ  publication.    This role  is  based  on  assigned  responsibilities  for  functional  areas  as  delegated  in  HAF  mission directives and/or Air Force policy directives.  See Chapter 8 and Table A2.1  2.11.  Approving Official.  Approve the release of publications for compliance and enforcement and  are  solely  responsible  for  ensuring  the  publications  are  necessary,  current  of  information, and in conformance with existing laws, policy, guidance and Air Force Mission.  Before signing the AF Form 673, it is the responsibility of the approving official to ensure the publication is not less  restrictive  than  higher  headquarters  publications.  (T-1).    If  needed,  it  may  be  more restrictive, where appropriate.  See Chapter 8. 2.12.  Coordinators. 2.12.1.  Coordinators  are  responsible  for  reviewing  and  providing  timely  coordination  on publications and forms from their particular functional perspective or area of expertise based on the rules reflected in the formal coordination table (Attachment 3). 2.12.2.  In  providing  concurrence,  coordinators  agree the  contents  within  a publication/form  from  a  functional  perspective.    Additionally,  coordinators  are  agreeing  to the  releasability  of  the  publication,  as  stated  by  the  OPR  in  the  publication.    Coordinators need to  provide  feedback to  the OPR if the content  or purpose of  a publication/form  are in conflict with existing policy or guidance, or if the releasability as stated in the publication is not in keeping with guidance in AFI 16-1404.  See Chapter 7 for procedures. to 32 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 CHAPTER 3 PROCESS OVERVIEW 3.1.  Draft and Collaborate. 3.1.1.  Is  a  new  publication  or  form  required?    Inadequate  research  could  result  in  issuing more than one publication/form on the same subject, conflicting instructions, or publishing a nonessential or incomplete publication or form.  Check the e-Publishing web site to find out if  any  other  publication  or  form  has  a  similar  subject.    If  there  is  a  related  publication  or form, consider consolidation/revision of publication or adoption of the form. 3.1.2.  Where to start?   3.1.2.1.  Review record set of previous publication actions to assist in determining SMEs, coordinators, and any issues encountered during previous action.  The record set should be  in  the  official  files  within  the  OPR  or  PM/FM’s  office.    See  Attachment  5  for processing guides.  3.1.2.2.  Contact  organization’s  PCM  for  help  determining  the  required  coordinators, prioritizing the new/change action, and identifying the impact/risk if not published. 3.1.2.3.  Contact supporting PM/FM to notify him/her of the proposed action and obtain assistance with formatting and processing. 3.1.3.  Where  are  authorities  found?    Review  higher  authority  policy,  directives,  and publications  to  identify  specific  directions  and  responsibilities  needing  to  be  implemented.  Ensure the implemented document contains direct authorities for the unit/organization/office issuing  the  publication.    For  example,  DoD  Issuances  (Directives  and  Instructions)  direct actions and assign responsibilities to the SECAF (aka: Head of DoD Component, Secretary of  the  Military  Department,  or  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force).    The  SECAF  then  issues  HAF MDs  and  AFPDs  to  delegate  authority  for  implementation  in  the  Air  Force  at  the  HAF  2-letters/digits  level.    The  HAF  2-letters/digits  then  issue  AFIs  and  AFMANs  to  provide detailed guidance, procedures, and to further assign responsibilities to 3/4 letter/digit offices, MAJCOMs, and Air Force Component Commands.  Subordinate publications would cite the publication that directly addressed their responsibilities, not the highest-level directives.  3.1.4.  Obtain inputs from subordinate activities during the drafting process (prior to formal coordination) and add all suitable information to reduce the need for additional implementing publications.    Regularly  review  publications  for  administrative  changes  (such  as  change  in organization symbols, office realignment, OPR, etc.).  Carefully review this  publication for guidance  on  selecting  the  right  publication/form  type,  formatting  standards,  coordination requirements, and maintaining the publication or form. 3.1.5.  See appropriate chapter (new, rewrite, interim change, administrative change, rescind, transfer, policy/guidance memorandum) in this publication for building the draft. 3.2.  Staffing.  HAF  PCMs  and  OPRs  use  the  HAF  Task  Management  Tool  (TMT)  to  staff publications/forms  formal  coordination,  certification  and  approval  packages,  IAW  HOI  33-3, Correspondence  Preparation,  Control,  and  Tracking.    The  HOI  identifies  TMT  as  the  official tasking/tracking  tool  for  all  task/staff  packages  within  the  HAF,  and  the  integrated  SharePoint AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 33 system has been designated as the document repository for this tool.  Use of TMT is optional for collaborative actions/reviews (AO, SME, etc. levels) prior to submitting for formal coordination.  However, records managers are reminded that SharePoint and TMT are not a certified System of Record.    Unit  records  management  shared  drives  have  been  designated  as  official  records storage.  The following entries need to be identified within the HAF TMT Tasker: 3.2.1.  Select  the  “AF  Publications”  or  “AF  Forms”  entry  in  the  pull-down  list  for  the “Category” field. 3.2.2.  Select the appropriate priority level (1-4) in the pull-down list for the “Priority” field.  3.2.3.  Select appropriate action being taken (Coord, Sign, Approve) in the pull-down list for the “Action” field.  3.3.  Formal Coordination.  Refer to Chapter 7 for detailed guidance.  3.3.1.  Coordinate  with  all  appropriate  offices  to  ensure  accuracy,  currency,  enforceability, and legality of the policy or guidance.  Use  Table A3.1 as  your starting point to determine coordinators. 3.3.2.  OPRs  are  permitted  to  collect  coordination  for  publications/forms  using  e-mail, approved systems, or SSS in lieu of the AF Form 673.  The staffing package does not have to include  the  AF  Form  673.    However,  the  endorsements  received  back  from  the  staffing package  (on  e-mail,  approved  system,  SSS,  multiple  AF  Form  673s)  for  coordination  are transcribed  to  a  master  AF  Form  673  prior  to  certification  and  approval.    Note:  Original documents  containing  the  endorsement  become  part  of  the  publications  record  set;  see Chapter  10  for  further  guidance  on  Records  Management.    The  transcribed  endorsement does not include the digital or wet signature. 3.4.  Certification.  Refer to Chapter 8 for detailed guidance. 3.4.1.  The  Certifying  Authority  is  at  the  issuing  level  (e.g.  MAJCOM  publications  are certified at the MAJCOM).  They certify the need for the publication, to include currency of information, applicability to the Air Force, and propriety of content.  See Attachment 3. 3.4.2.  Appropriate staffing packages include an AF Form 673 for signature.   3.5.  Approval.  Refer to Chapter 8 for detailed guidance. 3.5.1.  The approving authority is a senior leader at the issuing level responsible for policies and  guidance/procedures  pertaining  to  their  functional  area,  specialty  series,  or  assigned command.  SECAF approves all AF policy publications. 3.5.2.  An appropriate staffing package includes an AF Form 673 for signature.   3.6.  Publishing.  Refer to Chapter 9 for detailed guidance. 3.6.1.  All  publications/forms  are hosted on e-Publishing web site (departmental,  command, and  field  publications/forms  that  are  issued  at  the  wing/base  and  above  (excluding  ANG wings/subunits)).    The  e-Publishing  web  site  is  open  to  the  public,  so  only  the  unclassified titles  of  classified  and  restricted  access  products  are  provided,  along  with  directions  for accessing restricted web sites, and/or instructions on how to obtain copies from the OPR: 3.6.1.1.

By order of the Secretary of the Air Force, Air Force publications (those  listed  in  Table  4.1  &  Table  4.2  and  processed  IAW  this  publication)  issue  Air  Force policy  and/or  guidance.    Unless  otherwise  identified  in  Table  4.1  &  Table  4.2,  all  publication types  require  an  AF  Form  673  to  publish,  which  is  then  maintained  as  part  of  the  record  set.  Publications are separated into two categories: Directive and Nondirective.   4.1.1.  Directive Publications.  These publications are necessary to meet the requirements of law, safety, security, or other areas where common direction and standardization benefit the Air  Force.    Air  Force  personnel  must  comply  with  directive  publications  unless  waived  by proper authority. (T-1).  All publications in this category provide the following statement in the publication header: “COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY”.  Failure to comply with these written “directions” may be punishable by the UCMJ.  With the exception of restricted publications and those generated below wing/base level and by ANG wing/subunits,  publications  listed  in  Table  4.1  are  hosted  from  the  e-Publishing  web  site.  Additional  exceptions  on  where  publications  are  hosted  may  be  found  within  the  table.  Directive publication types are listed in Table 4.1 Table 4.1.  Directive Publications. Item   Publication Applicability   Issuing Level   Description  1  2 Type  Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD)  Air Force Policy Memorandum (AFPM) Departmental   HAF (Secretariat and Air Staff)  Departmental  HAF  AFPDs are orders of the SECAF and contain directive policy statements to initiate, govern, and/or regulate actions within specified areas of responsibility by Air Force activities. AFPMs are orders of the SECAF and contain directive policy statements to initiate, govern, and/or regulate actions within specified areas of responsibility by Air Force activities when there is insufficient time to process a new AFPD or to rewrite or IC an existing AFPD.  AFPMs expire one-year after their effective date, when superseded by a new AFPD, or upon next AFPD IC/rewrite action, whichever is earlier. OPRs must process and distribute a new or revised AFPD incorporating the material before the AFPM expires.  AFDPO will remove expired AFPMs 36 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 Item   Publication Applicability   Issuing Level   Description  Type  3  Mission Directives (MD)  Departmental   HAF  HAF  HAF  Intra-organization  MAJCOM, FOA, DRU and below from the e-Publishing web site and notify the OPR.   Only one AFPM is active at a time for a publication. OPRs consolidate guidance into a single AFPM when additional direction is to be provided and an AFPM is already active.   AFMDs prescribe the mission, area of responsibility, organization, and relationships of MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs with their respective units. Follow guidelines in AFI 38-601, Format and Content of Mission Directives.  AF/A1 assigns AFMD numbers IAW AFI 38-601.  HAF MDs prescribe the mission, organization, responsibilities, and relationships of HAF two-letter/digit offices. HAF MDs follow unique formatting, coordinating, and staffing processes, which are established in HOI 90-1, Headquarters Air Force Mission Directives: Delegation of Statutory Authority and Assignment of Responsibilities.  HAF MD numbers are assigned by SAF/AAII Policy Branch.  Organizations may publish MDs that are subordinate to an AFMD, prescribing the mission, organization, responsibilities, and relationships within a specific command. For example: AFMC MD 401, AFRC MD 1101, AMC MD 701. The format of these MDs is the same as AFMDs. Organization-specific MD numbers are assigned by the PM/FM.   AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 37 Item   Publication Applicability   Issuing Level   Description  Type  4 Instruction (I)   Departmental   HAF  Issuing Organization  MAJCOM, ANG, FOA, DRU and below 5 Manuals (MAN)  Departmental   HAF     Issuing Organization  MAJCOM, FOA, DRU and below  AFIs are orders of the Secretary of the Air Force and are certified and approved at the HAF (Secretariat or Air Staff) level. AFIs direct action, ensure compliance, and/or give detailed procedures to standard actions Air Force-wide. AFIs may be supplemented at any level below the HAF, unless otherwise stated in the publication.    Instructions that issue organization/establishment-specific guidance that is consistent and compliant with departmental or higher headquarters guidance found in AFIs, AFMANs, AF Supplement to DoDIs, MAJCOM Supplements or Instructions, etc. Unless otherwise authorized in the HHQ publication, subordinate units must issue a Supplement to extend the scope of guidance in a HHQ publication. Once departmental/higher headquarters guidance is published, units must review and revise or rescind applicable instructions/supplements to ensure compliance with new higher headquarters guidance.  AFMANs are usually extensions of instructions, providing additional guidance for performing standard tasks, or supporting education and training programs. An AFMAN does not necessarily have to fall under an AFI; an AFMAN may stand in place of an AFI, if appropriate.   Command/field manuals are usually extensions of command/field instructions, providing additional guidance for performing standard tasks, or supporting education and training programs. Command/field 38 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 Item   Publication Applicability   Issuing Level   Description  Type  6 Instructional Checklists and Addenda  Departmental   HAF   manuals do not implement higher-headquarters manuals; units must use supplements to implement higher-headquarters publications where practicable. Command/field manuals do not necessarily have to fall under a command/field instruction; a command/field manual may stand in place of an instruction, if appropriate.  Instructional checklists and addenda are separate supporting documents referenced in the basic instruction/manual. They provide detailed procedural guidance/steps necessary to accomplish a task/operation.  These products are not intended for data collection or inspection checklists; use a form when data is needed to be collected and retained.  Issuing Organization  MAJCOM, FOA, DRU and below Same as departmental, but, issued at the command/field level to support command/field publications.      7 Guidance Memorandums (GM)  Departmental   HAF  GMs are issued as interim guidance, to prescribe new procedures and guidance that affect many people or to address critical issues such as national security, safety of flight, etc., when there is insufficient time to process and distribute a new or revised guidance publication (AFI, AFMAN, or AF Supplement to a DoDI).   GMs expire one-year after their effective date, when superseded by a new guidance publication, or upon publication IC/rewrite action, whichever is earlier. OPRs must process and distribute a new or revised guidance publication incorporating the material before the GM expires. (T-1). AFDPO will remove expired GMs from the e-Publishing web site and AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 39 Item   Publication Applicability   Issuing Level   Description  Type  Issuing Organization  MAJCOM, FOA, DRU and below notify the OPR.   Only one GM at each level is allowed to be active at a time for a publication.  OPRs will consolidate guidance into a single GM when additional direction needs to be provided and a GM is already active. (T-1).  GMs may prescribe forms; however, OPRs need to also complete requirements in Chapter 12 of this publication if the action includes a form revision or issues a new form. Same as departmental, but, are issued by the command/field level to change their publications only. Cannot issue a command/field GM that changes a HHQ publication – may issue a GM that establishes or changes the command/field supplement, instruction, or manual.  May also be used to implement higher-headquarters GMs, or when implementing a newly revised higher headquarters publication (except AFPDs).  8  Operating Instructions  (OI)  Headquarters  Headquarters   Headquarters OIs (HOI) assign responsibilities, direct actions, and prescribe procedures within a headquarters staff (i.e., HAF, MAJCOM, NAF, group). HOIs are not applicable to subordinate units (e.g., FOA, DRU, wing, group, squadron, etc.).  Additional requirements for processing HOIs generated at HAF are found in HOI 33-13, Headquarters Air Force Operating Instruction (HOI) Program.  HAF OIs are posted on the e-Publishing web site. Exception: HOIs issued below the HAF level (MAJCOM and below) are 40 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 Item   Publication Applicability   Issuing Level   Description  Type  Issuing Unit Units below headquarters  made available locally (web sites, shared drives, etc.). OIs assign responsibilities, direct actions, and prescribe detailed procedures at the lowest level within a single subordinate function (i.e., a group OI applies to the group staff; a section OI applies to the section staff; etc.). For example: a group OI is only applicable to the group staff, if applicability to subordinate squadrons is needed, process group instruction or manual.  Exception:  OIs are made accessible locally (web sites, shared drives, etc.).  4.1.2.  Nondirective  publications.  These  publications  are informational  and  suggest guidance that you can modify to fit the circumstances.  Complying with publications in this category  is  expected,  but  not  mandatory.    Air  Force  personnel  use  these  publications  as reference  aids  or  “how-to”  guides.    Publications  in  this  category  follow  the  standard  AF format; publications managers may approve special or unique formats.  The “Compliance is Mandatory” statement is not used and they do not prescribe forms or any other type of data collection.    Publications listed  in  Table  4.2  are  hosted  from  the  e-Publishing  web  site  with the  exception  of  those  generated  below  wing/base  level  and  by  ANG  wing/subunits.  Additional  exceptions  on  where  publications  are  hosted  may  be  found  within  the  table.  Nondirective publication types are listed in Table 4.2 Table 4.2.  Nondirective Publications. tem   Publication Type  Applicability   Issued By  Description  1 Pamphlet (PAM)   Departmental, Command and Field  All Levels  Pamphlets are informational and may recommend procedures, identify best practices, and/or suggest “how to” implement Air Force guidance. Pamphlets may provide information regarding reports, but may not prescribe reports. They may reference forms and provide information on completing them, but may not prescribe them. Commands and field units may issue pamphlets that are applicable to their subordinate units. 2  Basic and Departmental,  LeMay Center,  Doctrine is a collection of statements of AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 41 Command and Field designated organizations for TTPs  Operational Doctrine and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) Documents  3 Directories  All Levels  Departmental, Command and Field 4 Handbooks   All Levels  Departmental, Command and Field officially sanctioned beliefs and warfighting principles that describe and guide the proper use of airpower in military action. Follow directions in AFI 10-1301, Air Force Doctrine Development, for development, format, and numbering of doctrine.   Directories are informational publications. They are usually in alphabetical or classed order, such as a listing of addresses, affiliations, functions, and similar data.  Handbooks are reference books of a particular subject or a compilation of factual data and instructional material not subject to frequent revision.  Commands and field units may issue handbooks that are applicable to their subordinate units. 5 Catalogs  All Levels  Departmental, Command and Field Catalogs are informational publications that describe and/or list a particular collection of information.   6 Visual Aids (VAs)  Departmental, Command and Field All Levels  VAs are posters or graphic illustrations. OPRs issue them for display on walls, bulletin boards, desks, base facilities, and other places. OPRs should combine and issue VAs at the highest levels, when possible. There are two kinds: Permanent VAs. These explain or instruct. An example is a chart portraying military insignia. Permanent VAs are attributable to guidance or information in a directive publication; there is no need to list VAs in the related publication, but OPRs must indicate the related publication number on the VA; e.g., “AFVA11-240 (Per AFI 1111-218)” or “AMCVA90-301 (Per AFI 90-301).” (T-2)  Temporary VAs. These inform or motivate, such as a poster promoting safe driving. As a rule, limit display to 180-calendar days or less. Show an expiration date in small type at the bottom of the VA; e.g., “Expires 30 42 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 May 2009.” If the VA shows the date of an event, you may eliminate the expiration date. AFDPO does not support the development or dissemination of temporary VAs; OPRs develop temporary VAs independently, in conjunction with the local graphics office, the DLA Document Services (formerly DAPS), etc. Temporary VAs do not require prescribing publications, numbers, indexing, coordination, or maintenance of a record set, and are not listed on the e-Publishing web site.  Commands and field units may issue VA that are applicable to their subordinate units. Product announcements publicize the availability of new, revised, or interim changes for Air Force publications and forms on the e-Publishing web site and in the MDD, as well as announcing cancellations and disseminating items of general interest to the publications/forms community.  AFDPO is responsible for product announcements. 7 Product Announcement (PA) Departmental  HAF 4.2.  Variations of Publications. 4.2.1.  Installation  Publications.  Installation  commanders  have  the  authority  to  issue installation  publications  (e.g.,  Scott  AFB  Instruction,  etc.).    Unless  limited  by  waivers granted under host-tenant agreements (see AFI 25-201), installation publications apply to all assigned or attached units.  They also  apply to  geographically separated units (off-base and remote site) if the subject matter covers the support and services given them by the issuing installation.  With the exception of ANG wing/subunits, installation publications are posted to the e-Publishing web site.  4.2.2.  Joint  Base  Publications.  Installation/base-level  publications  contain  procedures  for supporting  and  supported  components  on  Joint  Bases  only.    AF  OPRs  for  Joint  Base publications  must  ensure  the  authority  for  the  publication  is  defined  in  a  Memorandum  of Agreement (MOA) between the Joint Based components. (T-1). 4.2.2.1.  When the AF is the Supporting Component: The Air Force publication number, command  approval,  and  accessibility  and  releasability  statements  precede  those  of  the other  component.    Place  an  Interservice  Publication  Distribution  List,  with  Air  Force information  first,  in  the  header  of  the  document.    The  Air  Force  OPR  develops  and processes the publication according to this publication.  The Air Force OPR sends a draft to  the  supported  component  for  coordination.    The  supported  component  provides  a component  specific  publication  number  and  printing  and  shipping  instructions  (if AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 43 applicable).    The  Air  Force  OPR  works  with  the  supported  component  to  resolve  any issues identified during coordination.  The Air Force OPR completes coordination, then certification  and  approval.    The  Air  Force  OPR  shows  all  coordination,  including  those obtained from the supported component, on the AF Form 673, and sends one electronic copy of the draft to the supporting publications manager who forwards it to AFDPO for processing and posting onto the e-Publishing web site.  The Air Force OPR provides the supported components OPR with a link to the publication on the e-Publishing web site.  4.2.2.2.  When  the  AF  is  the  Supported  Component:  The  supporting  component’s  OPR develops and formats the publication according to their publishing procedures and sends the draft to the Air Force functional OPR for formal coordination.  At this point, the Air Force  OPR  obtains  a  publication  number  from  their  local  publications  manager  and provides it along with any comments to the supporting components OPR.  The Air Force OPR  works  with  the  supporting  component  to  resolve  any  differences  identified  during coordination.    The  supporting  component’s  publishing  activity  notifies  the  Air  Force OPR when the publication is released and provides a link to the published version.  The Air  Force  OPR  must  send  the  link  to  the  supporting  publications  manager  who  will forward to AFDPO for release on the e-Publishing web site. (T-1). 4.2.2.3.  Air  Force  OPRs  for  joint  base  publications,  whether  the  Air  Force  is  the supporting component or not, must meet the responsibilities and requirements for OPRs established in this publication. (T-1). 4.2.3.  Interservice  Publications.  Interservice  Publications  contain  departmental  level mutually agreed-upon procedures the Air Force and one or more of the military departments or DoD agencies (such as the Defense Logistics Agency [DLA]) need to carry out a common mission or function.  These publications may be of any directive or nondirective type listed in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2. 4.2.3.1.  When  the  Air  Force  is  the  lead  agent:  The  Air  Force  publication  number, command  approval,  and  accessibility  and  releasability  statements  precede  those  of  the other Military Departments or agencies.  The publication header has multiple publication designations  and  numbers  that  represent  all  services  involved;  list  the  Air  Force information first.  The Air Force OPR develops and processes the publication according to this publication.  4.2.3.1.1.  The  OPR  sends  a  draft  to  each  Military  Department  or  agency  OPR  for final  approval.    In  the  memorandum,  specifically  request  verification  of  their publication number, approving authority, distribution list, printing requirements, and shipping instructions (if applicable). 4.2.3.1.2.  The  OPR  then  completes  formal  HAF  coordination.    The  OPR  shows  all coordination,  including  those  obtained  from  other  Military  Departments,  on  the  AF Form  673,  and sends one electronic  copy of the  draft along with  a signed AF  Form 673 to AFDPO for processing. 4.2.3.2.  When the Air Force is not the lead agent:  4.2.3.2.1.  The  lead  agent’s  OPR  develops  and  formats  the  publication  according  to the lead agent’s publishing procedures and sends the draft to the Air Force functional OPR for preliminary coordination. 44 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 4.2.3.2.2.  The  Air  Force  OPR  ensures  that  the  appropriate  Air  Force  applicability, records management, waiver authority, and legal statements are included in the draft (see paragraph  6.5.6) and obtains the publication number from AFDPO.  4.2.3.2.3.  After  the  preliminary  coordination  has  been  returned  to  and  reviewed  by the  lead  agent,  the  updated  draft  is  then  returned  to  the  Air  Force  OPR  for  final formal HAF coordination.  4.2.3.2.3.1.  The  Air  Force  OPR  obtains  and  shows  all  coordination  on  the  AF Form  673;  has  the  certifying  and  approving  authorities  sign  it;  and  sends  the approved draft, by memorandum, to the lead agent for processing.  The Air Force OPR  works  with  the  lead  agent  to  resolve  any  differences  identified  during coordination.    The  lead  agent’s  publishing  activity  sends  a  memorandum  with  a 30-calendar-day  suspense  to  the  Air  Force  OPR  requesting  verification  of publication  number  and  approving  authority,  accessibility  and  releasability statements,  printing  requirements,  and  shipping  instructions.    The  lead  agent’s publishing activity notifies the OPR when the publication is released and provides a link to the published electronic version.   4.2.3.2.3.2.  The Air Force OPR sends the link, the completed AF Form 673, and the approved draft to AFDPO for release on the e-Publishing web site.  4.2.3.3.  Air Force OPRs for interservice publications, whether the Air Force is the lead agent or not, must meet the responsibilities and requirements for OPRs established in this publication. (T-1).  4.2.3.3.1.  AFDPO  assigns  control  numbers interservice publications;  the  publishing  manager  assigns  control  numbers  for  MAJCOM interservice publications.  for  departmental 4.2.3.3.2.  Interservice Publications are posted on the e-Publishing web site.  4.2.4.  AF Supplements to DoD Issuances. 4.2.4.1.  AF Supplements are departmental level publications that contain the full text of a DoD  Issuance and Air Force added material.   Supplements  receive an  appropriate AF publication  number  in  addition  to  the  number  of  the  issuance  (e.g.  DoD  5400.7-R_AFMAN33-302).  See AFI 90-101, Processing Department of Defense Issuances, for additional guidance on Air Force implementation of DoD Issuances.  4.2.4.2.  AF Supplements to DoD issuances that implement policy established in a DoDD or DoDI carry the same weight as directive, departmental publications listed in Table 4.1  4.2.4.3.  OPRs ensure publications do not contradict the higher headquarters publication.  The subordinate publications’ OPR will conduct  a special review to determine currency when the supplemented/implemented publication changes.  Refer to Chapter 5 for details on how to accomplish a special review. 4.2.5.  Command/Field Supplements. 4.2.5.1.  Command/field  supplements  extend  or  add  material  to  Air  Force  higher headquarters  publications.    With  the  exception  of  AFPDs,  AFPMs,  AF  supplements  to DoDDs, and DoDIs (a direct  supplement  to  a DoDI  carries the same weight  as an  AFI; AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 45 command/field  units  may  supplement  the  AF  supplement  to  the  DoDI),  command/field units  may  supplement  higher  headquarters  publication  unless  otherwise  directed  by  the OPR.  4.2.5.1.1.  Integrated  Supplement.    The  added  command/field  material  is  integrated into the higher level publication and published; paragraph numbering from the parent is retained.  4.2.5.1.2.  Standalone  Supplement.    Only  the  added  command/field  material  is published.    The  supplement  retains  the  paragraph  numbering  from  the  parent publication.  4.2.5.1.3.  AFDPO will integrate supplements unless specifically requested to publish as a standalone supplement (not-integrated) by the OPR.  4.2.5.1.4.  If  there  is  no  higher  headquarters  or  departmental  instruction  or  manual available to supplement, command/field units may issue a standalone command/field instruction or manual.  4.2.5.2.  OPRs  ensure  all  publications  do  not  contradict  the  higher  headquarters publication.  (T-1).    When  the  supplemented/implemented  publication  changes,  the subordinate publications’ OPR will conduct a special review to determine currency.  (T-2).  Refer to Chapter 5 for details on how to accomplish a special review. 4.2.5.3.  Supplements  issued  below  the  wing/base  and  by  ANG  wings/subunits  are  not integrated into the basic publication by AFDPO (known as a “Standalone” supplement). 4.3.  Content Limitations and Restrictions. 4.3.1.  AFPDs  and  AF  supplements  to  DoDDs  may  only  be  directly  implemented  by  AFIs and  AFMANs.    DoD  Issuances  may  only  be  directly  supplemented  or  implemented  by  a department-level publication.  4.3.2.  Unless  otherwise  noted  in  the  opening  paragraph  of  the  specific  publication,  all  AF publications, except AFPDs, may be supplemented.  Exceptions:  4.3.2.1.  If  no  departmental-level  guidance is  provided  (e.g.,  AFIs,  AFMANs), command/field units may issue command/field instructions to directly implement AFPDs and AF supplements to DoDDs.  AF Unit Commanders must rescind/revise its instruction to  implement  the  higher  headquarters  guidance,  once  higher  headquarters  guidance  is published. (T-1).  4.3.2.2.  Command activities may not issue command doctrine documents, nor may they supplement basic or operational Doctrine. (T-1). 4.3.3.  Do not put the following in your publication: 4.3.3.1.  Articles intended only to encourage or obtain the support of persons outside the Government. (T-1). 4.3.3.2.

Partisan political campaign articles or editorials. (T-1). 46 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 5 ACTIONS 5.1.  Overview.  This chapter outlines the approved actions for creating, revising, obsolescing, or transferring official publications.  See Attachment 5 for processing guides. 5.2.  Assistance: 5.2.1.  The  publications  manager  provides  guidance  regarding  the  publications  process.  Early and continuing coordination with the publications manager avoids unnecessary delay.  5.2.1.1.  The HAF publications manager resides  within AFDPO-PPP.  He/she can assist with  development  of  Air  Force  level  publications  (AFPDs,  AFIs,  AFMANs,  etc.)  and forms.   Contact  information  is  available on the e-Publishing web site or through e-mail using the Global Address List (GAL).  5.2.1.2.  The MAJCOM publications managers are centralized under AFSPC in the Cyber Support  Squadron  (CYSS/CYI).    They  provide  support  for  all  MAJCOM  level publications  and  forms  development.    Their  e-mail  contact  information  is  “AFSPC CYSS/CYI MAJCOM PUBS” using the GAL.  Note: Excludes ANG, given they are not a MAJCOM. 5.2.1.3.  All  other  organizational  levels  (to  include  the  ANG)  may  supplement  this publication  to  identify  the  office  and  contact  information  for  specific  publications  and forms managers. 5.2.2.  The PCM provides organization and content specific guidance to assist in building the publication formal coordination package and identifying waiver authorities.  The publication staffing package contains the following information: 5.2.2.1.  What is changing and why. 5.2.2.2.  Impact and risk of not implementing. 5.2.2.3.  Risk  assessment  rating  (using  appropriate  RM  publication)  and  priority  for processing. 5.2.2.3.1.  Processing Priority 1.  Extremely High. 5.2.2.3.2.  Processing Priority 2.  High. 5.2.2.3.3.  Processing Priority 3.  Medium. 5.2.2.3.4.  Processing Priority 4.  Low. 5.2.2.4.  Required coordinators. 5.2.2.5.  Who certifies and approves the final publication/form. 5.3.  Creating a New Publication. 5.3.1.  A new publication may be required when existing publications cannot be modified to incorporate  new  subject  matter  content  (policy,  guidance  or  procedures).    In  such  cases, contact  the  local  publications  manager  for  advice  concerning  choosing  a  publication  type, creating  a  title,  coordinating  the  draft  publication.    He/she  provides  templates  and  a AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 47 publication  number,  and  receives  approved  draft  and  AF  Form  673  for  publishing.  Attachment 5 to this publication provides step-by-step processing guidance. 5.3.2.  Required steps for new publications: 5.3.2.1.  Draft  and  collaborate  with  PCM  and/or  Subject  Matter  Experts  (SMEs)  (See Chapter 6). 5.3.2.2.  Formal Coordination. (T-3). 5.3.2.3.  Certifying Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1). 5.3.2.4.  Approving Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1). 5.3.2.5.  Submit to publications manager for final processing.   5.4.  Publication Currency/Review. 5.4.1.  OPR Initiated.  OPRs are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and currency of their publications and must take actions to  revise or  rescind  publications  as necessary.   An OPR may review his/her publication at  any time and update it to  reflect  changes in  laws, policy, guidance, or procedures.  They may also certify their publications current at any time.  OPRs are responsible for initiating actions to keep their publications current. 5.4.2.  Periodic  required  review  (every  4  years).  Publications  managers  initiate  a  review task  to  the  publication  OPR  every  four  years  on  the  anniversary  month  of  the  publications effective date or last certified current date, whichever is later.  OPRs are required to review their publication and associated prescribed forms and provide the status of each. (T-3). 5.4.3.  Special  Review.  Changes  to  mission,  implemented  publications,  laws,  regulations, policies, or reorganizations are some instances that may trigger initiation of a special review.  Publications managers will, upon request or once made aware of need for review, initiate a review task to the publication OPR and track the review. (T-3). 5.4.4.  Periodic  and  Special  Review  Task.  OPRs are given at least 30 days to assess their publications and forms and respond with a status back to the publications manager on an AF Form 399 or within AFIMPT.  5.4.4.1.  Status  responses  include  “Certify  Current,”  “Requires  Revision,”  “Requires Transfer,”  or  “Is  Obsolete”.    OPRs  may  also  identify  if  a  physical  publication  or  form may  be  converted  to  electronic  format–  AF  is  mandated  to  reduce  printing  costs  and reduce/convert physical/printed media as much as possible. 5.4.4.2.  If  reporting  a  status  of  “Certify  Current”  for  the  publication  and  associated prescribed forms. 5.4.4.2.1.  The  OPR  completes  an  AF  Form  399  that  is  signed  by  the  publications approving official. (T-1).  5.4.4.2.2.  The completed form is submitted for publishing using AFIMPT or staffed to the local PM if it is a locally hosted publication.  See paragraph  5.5 for details on certifying a publication current.    5.4.4.3.  If  reporting  a  status  other  than  “Certify  Current”  (“Requires  Revision,” “Requires Transfer,” “Is Obsolete,” or “Other”).   48 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 5.4.4.3.1.  The OPR completes the review action by reporting the status of the subject publication and forms.  5.4.4.3.1.1.  Publications  hosted  on  AFIMPT  do  not  require  a  signed  AF  Form 399, Air Force Publication/Form Status Request, for this status.  Users submit the action in the application and it will close the Review and initiate the selected task for the publication (rewrite, IC, rescind, etc.).   5.4.4.3.1.2.  Publications  not  hosted  on  AFIMPT  do  require  a  signed  AF  Form 399 for this task.  The OPR may sign as the approving authority for this action on the form.   5.4.4.3.2.  The  OPR/POC  will  then  start  and  complete  the  actual  action  reported during  the  Review  (Requires  Revision  (IC,  rewrite),  Requires  Transfer,  or  Is Obsolete) within 180 days.   5.4.4.4.  If  no  response  is  provided  to  the  task,  the  publications  manager  may  initiate  a rescind action.  The publications manager may staff an AF Form 673 to the certifying and approving officials to rescind the publication and all associated prescribed forms.   5.4.5.  Customer  Identified  Changes  or  Conflicting  Material.  Any Air Force member or employee  may  report  errors,  suggest  revisions,  and  recommend  corrective  action  by submitting  an  AF  Form  847  to  the  OPR,  or  through  the  appropriate  functional  chain  of command  for  higher  headquarters  publications  (refer  to  Attachment  6  for  instructions  on completing the AF Form 847).  5.4.5.1.  When a unit issues a publication that conflicts with one of its own publications, the  activity  noting  the  discrepancy  should  submit  an  AF  Form  847  to  both  OPRs highlighting the conflict  and requesting a resolution.  OPRs are responsible for working with each other to deconflict and issue the correct publication(s). 5.4.5.2.  Commands or Units should submit an AF Form  847 to  both  OPRs.  AF Forms 847  submitted  for  departmental  publications  are  to  be  sent  through  the  appropriate functional chain of command. (T-1). 5.5.  Certification of Publication as Current. 5.5.1.  If  during  a  periodic  or  special  review  the  OPR  determines  there  are  no  required changes to the publication, the OPR may indicate such status on the AF Form 399 and submit it  to  the  appropriate  PM/FM.    The  publication  OPR  and  approving  authority  (approving official  or  delegate)  must  sign  the  form,  no  coordination  is  required.  (T-1).    Note: Publications need to meet content requirements as identified in Chapter 6 of this publication to be considered current.      5.5.2.  AFDPO marks the publication “Certified Current on” plus the effective date, directly below the existing published date on the publication.   5.5.3.  This action establishes the new periodic review date for the next four-year cycle.   5.5.4.  OPRs may certify their publications current while accomplishing an Interim Change if appropriate.    Ensure  the  “Certify  Current”  block  is  checked  on  the  AF  Form  673  and  the staffing package for the IC identifies that the action also certifies the publication current. 5.5.5.  Publication rewrites and certified current actions reset the four-year review cycle. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 49 5.6.  Update/Revise an Existing Publication. 5.6.1.  Changing  the  policy,  guidance,  or  procedures  found  in  official  publications  is accomplished  by  rewriting  the  publication  or  issuing  an  IC,  Administrative  Change  (AC), AFPM, or GM to the specific publication.  Changes using any other vehicles/mechanisms are not  permitted as they can create conflict  with  officially published policy and  guidance, and cause confusion that could degrade mission accomplishment and safety.   5.6.2.  Changes  to  publications  are  either  permanent  or  temporary  and  they  are  either integrated into the publication or are simply attached on top of the publication.  This section defines  the  different  types  of  changes  and  whether  they  are  permanent/temporary  or integrated/attached.    5.6.2.1.  Permanent change is effective for the life of the published version (rewrite, IC).   5.6.2.2.  Temporary change expires after a period of time (AFPM, GM). 5.6.2.3.  Integrated  change  is  physically  inserted  into  the  text  of  the  original  document (IC). 5.6.2.4.  Attached  change  is  a  separate  document  that  sits  on  top  of  the  original document and notifies the reader that the original has changed.  The text changes are not physically made to the original document (AFPM, GM, AC).   5.6.3.  Publication Rewrite (Permanent & Integrated). 5.6.3.1.  A  full  publication  rewrite  is  accomplished  when  major  changes  to  the  policy, guidance, and/or procedures are warranted/needed.   5.6.3.2.  Use the published version as a starting point for the rewrite, as appropriate.  The electronic  record  set  should  contain  the  Word  version  of  the  last  final  draft.    Your publications manager may also be able to assist in providing an editable version to start your rewrite.      5.6.3.3.  A rewrite is a clean start to the publication, so you have the ability to renumber and  remove  “DELETED”  paragraphs/sections  from  previous  ICs.    OPRs  ensure  the rewrite  incorporates  any  existing  ACs,  AFPMs  or  GMs  that  are  attached  to  the publication. 5.6.3.4.  The Publication OPR will ensure the following required steps are accomplished for a publication rewrite: 5.6.3.4.1.  Draft and collaborate with PCM and/or SMEs. 5.6.3.4.2.  Formal Coordination. (T-1). 5.6.3.4.3.  Certifying Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1). 5.6.3.4.4.  Approving Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1). 5.6.3.4.5.  Submit to publications manager for final processing. 5.6.4.  Interim Change (IC) (Permanent & Integrated). 5.6.4.1.  Action taken to change just a portion of the publication when a full rewrite is not warranted.  50 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 5.6.4.2.  IC Rule 1. Provide just the elements that are changing (full paragraphs, chapters, attachments,  tables,  and/or  figures)  and  AFDPO  will  replace  information  in  the publication with the new material;  5.6.4.3.  IC Rule 2. Provide the entire publication (full text) with a Summary of Changes and  the  changed  elements  (paragraphs,  chapters,  attachments,  tables,  and/or  figures) marked with an asterisk (*);   5.6.4.4.  At a future date to be determined, if the IC is over ten (10) pages, the OPR will be  required  to  submit  using  the  IC  Rule  2.    AFDPO  tools  are  being  modified  to  accept this type of change. 5.6.4.5.  If  the  publication  being  changed  was  not  formatted  by  AFDPO  (AF  Supp  to DoD Issuance, format waivered pubs, etc.) the OPR must use IC Rule 2 and integrate the new  material  into  the  existing  publication  providing  a  camera  ready  version  (in  a Microsoft  Word®  document)  to  their  publications  manager  for  processing.  (T-1).    The OPR identifies the changed material with an asterisk (*) preceding the paragraph, table, figure, or attachment number. 5.6.4.6.  ICs cannot be issued to change AFPMs or GMs.  These publications must be re-issued in their entirety if changes are needed.  5.6.4.7.  IC’s  must  supersede  or  incorporate  the  text  from  any  active  GMs  or  AFPMs.  (T-1). 5.6.4.8.  Formatting ICs.   5.6.4.8.1.  IC  Rule  1  are  drafted  as  a  separate  Microsoft  Word®  document  with  a short  header,  Summary  of  Changes,  and  just  those  elements  (paragraphs,  tables, figures,  and  attachments)  that  are  replaced  in  the  published  version.    See  Table  5.1 for visual sample. 5.6.4.8.1.1.  Changes are made in complete paragraphs, (i.e., the entire paragraph is  submitted  to  replace  the  existing  paragraph,  even  if  only  one  word  or  one sentence changed).  A change may not  cause existing content to be renumbered; you  may  add  new  paragraphs  or  sub-paragraphs  (or  figures,  chapters,  etc.)  as needed to insert additional material but the insertion of new material needs to be done without causing the existing content to be renumbered.  Changed material is identified  with  a  margin  bar  when  the  integrated  publication  is  formatted  by AFDPO or asterisks if formatted by the OPR. 5.6.4.8.1.2.  Figures,  Tables,  and  Attachments.    Completely  delete  or  provide  a revised  figure,  table,  or  attachment  to  replace  the  current  figure,  table,  or attachment.  New figures, tables, and attachments can be added as long as there is a reference to them in a paragraph. 5.6.4.8.2.  IC Rule 2 is a full text document that contains the changed and unchanged material.    The  OPR  downloads  the  “.AFDPO”  file  from  AFIMPT  and  adds  a Summary of Changes and then makes the changes to that document marking changed elements (paragraphs, tables, figures, etc.) with an asterisk.  5.6.4.8.3.  Submit the ICs in Microsoft Word®, 12-point Times New Roman font.  AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 51 5.6.4.8.4.  Under either IC rule, a deleted paragraph requires a placeholder that cites the  paragraph  number  and  the  word  DELETED,  (e.g.,  “3.77.  DELETED”).    Note: References  to  deleted  content  are  removed  and  the  document  re-numbered  during  a rewrite. 5.6.4.9.  The Publication OPR will ensure the following required steps are accomplished for an IC: 5.6.4.9.1.  Draft and collaborate with PCM and/or SMEs. 5.6.4.9.2.  Formal Coordination. (T-1). 5.6.4.9.3.  Certifying Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1). 5.6.4.9.4.  Approving Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1). 5.6.4.9.5.  Submit to publications manager for final processing. Table 5.1.  Sample Interim Change Rule 1. IC-1 TO AFI 32-6005, UNACCOMPANIED HOUSING MANAGEMENT 9 October 2008  *SUMMARY OF CHANGES This interim change revises AFI32-6005 by (1) changing the minimum dormitory utilization rate from 90 to 95 percent, (2) updating the Air Force Specialty Code identifier for personnel assigned to Airmen Dormitory Leader duties from Reporting Identifier (RI) 9D0000, Dormitory Manager, to Special Duty Identifier (SDI) 8H000, Airman Dormitory Leader, per the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, and (3) adding policy associated with sex offender disclosure requirements.  A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.  *1.2.3.25. Established disclosure processes for persons assigned to or applying for unaccompanied housing who are sex offenders.  Commanders must ensure all current residents comply with the requirements for disclosure and determine appropriate actions based on results of disclosure. *1.2.7.6. Conducts training for UH Managers IAW approved, established SDI 8H000 Job Qualification Standards (JQS). *1.2.3.8. Strives to maintain an optimum utilization rate of 95 percent for all priorities in dormitories, UOQ and UNCOQ, and a minimum utilization rate of 95 percent for Priority 1 and 2 personnel and designated UOQs and UNCOQs for Priority 3 and 4 personnel. *4.2.2.7. DELETED *4.7.2. Occupancy of adequate UH by Priority 1 and 2 personnel is below 95 percent utilization. 5.6.5.  Administrative Change (AC) (Permanent & Attached). 5.6.5.1.  ACs  are  those  that  do  not  affect  the  subject  matter  content,  authority,  purpose, application, and/or implementation of the publication.  Since these types of changes are 52 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 non-substantive,  no  coordination  is  required.    While  there  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of ACs to a publication, all changes are consolidated into one document.  5.6.5.2.  ACs  include:  Office  symbol  changes  (OPR,  certifying  official’s  office  symbol, and office symbols mentioned in the text) due to a transfer of responsibility for a function or  a  publication,  or  as  a  result  of  a  reorganization.    Other  changes  may  be  made  on  a waiver basis; submit waiver requests to your publications manager.  5.6.5.3.  Only OPRs may initiate an AC to their publication.  The approving official for AC’s are three-letter officials at or above the OPR. (T-3).   SAF/AA will approve ACs to AFPDs and AF supplements to DoDDs.   5.6.5.4.  ACs are not integrated into the basic publication, but appear as the first page(s) when  the  publication  is  opened  from  the  e-Publishing  site.    The  AC  notification  is removed when the publication is next updated (IC or rewrite).  OPRs must include ACs in an IC or a rewrite to incorporate changes into the actual publication. (T-1). 5.6.5.5.  Submit  the  AC  in  Microsoft  Word®,  12-point  Times  New  Roman  font.    See Figure  5.1  for  an  example  of  an  AC.    The  AC  needs  to  contain  directions  that  let  the reader know what changes are effective (e.g., References to AF/DP should be changed to AF/A1  throughout  the  publication;  references  to  SAF/AAX  should  be  changed  to SAF/AAII Policy Branch in paragraphs 1.5 and 3.6).  A date is assigned to that AC when it is posted with the publication and placed at the end of the description of changes. 5.6.5.6.  ACs are listed chronologically in one document.  It is the OPR’s responsibility to keep an updated list of ACs; OPRs submit a complete list of all changes each time a new AC is added.  The date assigned to each previous AC is incorporated into the document submitted  by  the  OPR  (e.g.,  References  to  AF/DP  should  be  changed  to  AF/A1 throughout  the  publication;  references  to  SAF/AAX  should  be  changed  to  SAF/AA  in paragraph 1.5 and 3.6. 15 March 2005.). 5.6.5.7.  Unless explicitly stated, the addition of an AC does not cancel existing ACs.  If explicitly stated (e.g. References to AF/XOI should be changed to AF/A2; this supersedes the AC dated 31 March 2006), “Canceled” will be inserted by the OPR next to the date of the superseded AC.  Once an IC is made to a publication or the publication is rewritten, all ACs posted for that publication are removed from the e-Publishing web site. 5.6.5.8.  The Publication OPR will ensure the following required steps are accomplished for an AC: 5.6.5.8.1.  Draft and collaborate with PCM and/or SMEs, as necessary. 5.6.5.8.2.  No coordination required.  5.6.5.8.3.  No Certifying Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673.  5.6.5.8.4.  Three-letter Official’s approving endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-3).  5.6.5.8.5.  Submit to publications manager for final processing. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 53 Figure 5.1.  Sample Administrative Change. 5.6.6.  Air  Force  Policy  Memorandum  (AFPM)  and  Guidance  Memorandum  (GM) (Temporary & Attached).  5.6.6.1.  AFPMs and GMs are used to issue or change policy or guidance when there is not enough time to process a new publication or take an action to permanently change an existing publication.  The memorandum has a reduced coordination and approval process to  expedite  delivery,  but  this  reduces  opportunity  for  organizations  to  evaluate  impact.  For this reason, the use of AFPMs and GMs needs to be strictly controlled to only those instances where immediate release is appropriate due to a risk of life, safety, property, or mission.    Note:  “Policy  letters,”  endorsement  letters,  guides,  and  bulletins  are  not recognized as part of the publishing program; any new guidance or information issued in a  policy/endorsement  letter,  guide,  or  bulletin  requiring  implementation/compliance should  be  established  in  a  publication  type  described  in  this  publication  and  processed accordingly. 5.6.6.2.  Punitive  Language  in  AFPMs,  AFGMs,  and  Command/Field  GMs.    The  AF publication  OPRs  must  clearly  identify  the  punitive  nature  of  the  guidance,  for  all AFPMs, AFGMs, and command/field GMs as applicable. (T-1).  5.6.6.3.  The memorandum is valid for one year from the issued date.  At the end of the one  year  period,  the  memorandum  “expires”;  AFDPO  removes  expired  AFPMs/GMs from the e-Publishing web site and notifies the OPR and PM of the action. 5.6.6.4.  OPRs  must  publish  a  new  publication  or  change  an  existing  one  to  reflect  the policy or guidance provided in the memorandum. (T-1). 5.6.6.5.  OPRs  may  extend  the  effective  period  of  a  memorandum  and  reissue (recommend this be accomplished before the expiration date of the memorandum), by re-coordinating the memorandum as necessary and obtaining certification and approval on a new AF Form 673. 5.6.6.6.  OPRs  should  contact  their  publications  managers  for  editable  templates  of AFPMs and GMs. 5.6.6.7.  AFPMs are AF level policy documents and are approved by the SECAF.  OPRs develop  the policy document to  reflect  changes to  an existing AFPD or to  create  a new AFPD.   54 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 5.6.6.8.  GMs  are  guidance  documents  and  are  approved  by  appropriate  approving officials  at  the  organizational  level  at  which  the  GM  is  issued  (AF  GMs  are  issued  by HAF, AFMC GMs are issued by AFMC, etc.).  OPRs develop the guidance document to reflect changes to an existing Instruction/Manual (AFI, AFMCI, etc.) or creation of a new Instruction/Manual.   OPRs will apply tier waiver authority designators to  GMs like any other publication (see paragraph  1.9.3.2). (T-1).   5.6.6.9.  The AF publication OPR's required steps for an IC or AFPMs/GMs are: 5.6.6.9.1.  Draft and collaborate with PCM and/or SMEs. 5.6.6.9.2.  Legal  Coordination organization’s legal office for subordinate GMs). (T-1). (AF/JAA for  AFPMs  and  AFGMs, Issuing 5.6.6.9.3.  SAF/AA coordination for all AFPMs. 5.6.6.9.4.  Certifying Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1). 5.6.6.9.5.  Approving Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1). 5.6.6.9.6.  Submit to publications manager for final processing.   5.7.  Transfer of Responsibility/Ownership of a Publication. 5.7.1.  Responsibility  for  a  publication  should  be  transferred  when  the  current  approving authority  believes  his/her  office  no  longer  has  responsibility  for  the  policy  or  guidance contained  in  the  publication.    In  such  cases,  the  approving  authority  should  identify  and obtain the concurrence of the proposed new approving authority for the publication. 5.7.2.  The  losing  office  will  staff  a  package  to  the  gaining  office  to  document acceptance/rejection  of  transfer.  (T-3).    The  OPR  may  use  standard  staffing  package  (Task Management Tool (TMT), SSS, memo, etc.) or AF Form 673 to document the transfer.    5.7.3.  The SECAF must approve transfer of SECAF assigned responsibilities in HAF MDs or AFPDs.  The SECAF must approve change of certifying authority for an AFPD.  Refer to AFI  90-101  and  HOI  90-1  for  detailed  guidance  on  how  to  transfer  responsibility  for  the DoD issuance. 5.7.4.  Change OPR only.  Changing the office that authors the publications or forms (OPR) is  finalized  by  the  certifying  or  approving  official  of  the  publication/form  and  reported  to local  PM/FMs.    The  affected  publication/form  is  updated  as  soon  as  possible  to  reflect  the change.  Use SSS, memo, or AF Form 673.  Coordination outside of the organization is not required.   5.7.5.  In addition to carrying out all reorganization/realignment responsibilities described in AFI  10-501,  Program  Action  Directives  (PADS),  Program  Guidance  Letters  (PGLS), Programming  Plans  (PPLANS),and  Programming  Messages  (PMSGS),  gaining  OPRs  for transferred  publications  will  revise  the  publication  to  change  the  publication  number  (if transferring to  a different  subject  series),  certifying  and  approving official  information,  and any other affected content.  The record set for the publication being transferred is also moved to  the  gaining  OPR  or  PM/FM;  accommodations  for  this  action  are  written  into  transfer agreements (PAD, PGL, etc.). AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 55 5.7.6.  The losing Publication OPR will ensure the following required steps are accomplished for a publication transfer: 5.7.6.1.  Draft package and collaborate with PCM and/or SMEs. 5.7.6.2.  Coordinate with gaining office. (T-3). 5.7.6.3.  Losing Approving Official signs as the Certifying Official on AF Form 673. (T-1). 5.7.6.4.  Gaining  Approving  Official  signs  as  the  Approving  Official  on  AF  Form  673. (T-1). 5.7.6.5.  Submit to publications manager for final processing. 5.8.  Obsolete  Publications.  A  publication  becomes  obsolete  when  another  publication supersedes it, when the  OPR rescinds  it, or when AFDPO removes it from  the publishing web site because it is expired (as is the case with AFPMs, GMs, VAs, and outdated supplements). 5.8.1.  Obsolete  publications/forms  are  removed  from  the  active  Product  Index  on  the  e-Publishing  and  other  web  sites.    Links  to  obsolete  publications  are  removed  and  AFDPO releases  a  product  announcement  to  notify  subscribers  of  the  cancellation.    OPRs  should notify affected staff offices when a publication is released, revised, or rescinded and posted on the e-Publishing web site.  The OPR notice should include a statement alerting recipients that related publications and/or processes may be affected.   5.8.2.  Obsolete  products  (rescinded,  superseded  and  expired)  are  listed  (no  link)  in  the Obsolete Product Index with reference to action taken and if applicable, link to superseding product. 5.8.3.  ANG  notifies  subscribers  of  cancellations  to  all  Publication  Distribution  Office accounts. 5.8.4.  Rescission.  OPR  action  to  remove  the  publication  from  circulation  without  being replaced by another publication.  To rescind a publication, OPRs must complete coordination and obtain certification and approval using the AF Form 673. (T-1).  5.8.4.1.  The  OPR  submits  the  properly  completed  and  signed  AF  Form  673  to  the publications/  forms  manager.    Provide  disposition  instructions  on  the  AF  Form  673, following guidance in AFI 16-1404 for classified publications. 5.8.4.2.  If the rescinded publication prescribes an AF form or a report, the OPR includes this information on the AF Form 673 and sends a copy of the request for rescission to the information  reports  management  and  control  office.    Note:  When  a  publication  is rescinded,  any  prescribed  forms  or  reports  are  rendered  obsolete.    Additionally,  any implementing and/or supplementing publications need to be reviewed for currency.  5.8.4.3.  If the publication is an AFPD or an AF supplement to a DoDD, only the SECAF may approve the rescission. 5.8.4.4.  If  the  publication  implements  a  DoD  Issuance,  the  OPR  identifies  on  the  AF Form  673  that  the  requirements  are  no  longer  valid  or  are  met  in  a  separate,  active publication  (list  publications,  if  applicable)  and  obtains  SAF/AAII  Policy  Branch coordination in addition to other coordination. 56 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 5.8.4.5.  If no response is provided to a periodic or special review  task, the publications manager may initiate a rescind action.  The publications manager staffs an AF Form 673 to the certifying and approving officials only to rescind the publication and all associated prescribed  forms.    If  approved,  the  products  are  removed  from  circulation  and  the associated AF Form 673 is sent to the OPR for closeout of the record-set. 5.8.5.  Supersession.  5.8.5.1.  Action by which a new/revised publication is issued to replace the older version.  Action to publish a new or revised publication includes the supersession action.  The new publication and the AF Form 673 identify the publication in the “Supersedes/Superseded” section/block.  5.8.5.2.  Taking  this  action  at  the  same  time  a  revision  is  published  allows  the  pubs manager  to  remove  the  superseded  publication(s)  without  doing  a  separate  “rescind” action.   5.8.6.  Expired Publications. 5.8.6.1.  AFPMs and GMs expire one-year after the date of publication.  the 5.8.6.2.  Supplements  and  other implemented  higher  headquarters  publication  changes  and  the  newer  version  states  that all supplements and/or implementing publications are cancelled/obsolete.  implementing  publications  may  expire if 5.8.6.3.  Expired  AFPMs,  GMs,  supplements,  and  other  implementing  publications  will be  removed  from  circulation,  and  the  e-Publishing  web  site.    They  are  considered cancelled.    Forms  prescribed  by  these  publications  and  related  visual  aids  become obsolete.    Because  no  AF  Form  673  is  used  in  the  removal,  the  record  set  for  the publication should refer to the sections in this publication as justification for cancellation and “closeout” of the record. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 57 Chapter 6 DEVELOPING THE PUBLICATION 6.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  describes  the  structure  and  content  requirements  for  specific sections within a publication.  Unique requirements for ICs and ACs are found in Chapter 5 and requirements for VAs, Supplements, and AFPMs/GMs are found at the very end of this chapter.  OPRs can find general publication templates on the AFIMPT website or their local publications manager may have unit specific templates to assist in building the publication.  6.2.  Select/Confirm  Subject  Series  and  Number.  Most  Air  Force  publications  are  related  to an  Air  Force  specialty  code  (AFSC);  see  Attachment  2  for  series  descriptions.    Publications managers can assist the POC in making this determination.  6.2.1.  All directive departmental publications that issue guidance (Instructions and Manuals) have  an  antecedent  AFPD.    OPRs  identify  the  antecedent  AFPD  when  requesting  a publication number from the publications manager.  6.2.2.  If the publication is a rewrite, it typically bears the same series and control number as the superseded publication.  Exception: Publications being realigned under different AFPDs, or consolidated, may have new series and control numbers.   6.2.3.  When  publications  ‘owned’  by  different  OPRs  are  combined,  a  statement  of concurrence clearly designating the ‘owner’ of the consolidated publication is a requirement.  The OPR of the new publication may base the publication number on one of the combined publications  or  request  a  new  one.    Also,  implementing/supplementary  publications  are updated by IC or revision to reflect the new publication number as appropriate. 6.2.4.  Request a publication number from the publications manager. 6.2.5.  The abbreviation of the highest overall security classification or CUI restriction within the  publication  or  form  is  added  to  the  end  of  the  publication  or  form  number:  “-C”  for Confidential, “-S” for Secret, and “-TS” for Top Secret; “-O” for FOUO. 6.3.  Select/Create  a  Title.  When  developing  a  new  publication,  select  a  meaningful,  concise title.  6.3.1.  Do  not  use  terms  such  as  “policy,”  “instruction,”  “guidance,”  “handbook,” “pamphlet,” “catalog,” “guide,” or “book,” etc., in the title of the publication.  Additionally, there is no need to identify “Air Force” in the title since this is an AF publication.   6.3.2.  If  supplementing  a  higher  headquarters  publication  at  the  HAF,  command,  or  in  the field, maintain the title of the original publication, minus any organizational level identifiers (DoD, etc.). 6.3.3.  For classified (C, S, TS) publications and forms, the unclassified title has “(U)” added to the end of the title.  If the title is classified, the words “Classified Title (U)” is used as the title. 6.4.  Research  and  Develop  the  Policy  or  Guidance.  Conduct  research  and  collaborate  with SMEs.    The  OPR’s  POC  should  review  higher  authority  policy,  directives,  and  publications  to identify specific directions and responsibilities that need to  be implemented.  They should also 58 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 ensure  the  implemented  document  contains  direct  authorities  for  the  unit/organization/office issuing the publication.  Utilize the most efficient means to collaborate.   6.5.  Constructing the Draft. 6.5.1.  Not  for  Implementation.    Drafts  are  for  development  and  coordination  only,  not  for implementation  or  compliance.    Drafts  may  be  circulated  to  inform  users  of  forthcoming changes, but OPRs must never release draft content with instructions to comply.  Users are not required to comply until content is certified, approved, and posted/released.  Each draft is marked “DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE” across the top of each page (header).  (T-1).   Note:  Do not  use watermarks, as this reduces  the readability of the draft. 6.5.2.  Reference  the  United  States  Government  Publishing  Office  (GPO)  Style  Manual (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/content-detail.html),  Plain Writing Act of 2010, and DoDI 5025.01 for additional guidance on writing style, grammar, formatting, etc.  6.5.3.  OPRs  must  structure  the  content  of  publications  in  the  following  order:  publication header,  opening  paragraph;  summary  of  changes  (if  applicable);  table  of  contents  (if applicable  –  see  paragraph    6.5.9);  “overview”  or  “background”;  detailed  responsibilities; core  content;  approvers  signature  block;  attachments  (Attachment  1  is  titled  “Glossary  of References and Supporting Information” and include a list of references cited, prescribed and adopted forms, definitions for  abbreviations  and acronyms  used,  and a description of terms used). (T-1). 6.5.4.  Create drafts using Microsoft Word® in 12-point Times New Roman font, with one-inch top, bottom, left, and right margins. Include page numbers on draft publications.   6.5.4.1.  See  AFMAN  33-361  for  guidance  on  formatting  details  and  contact  your publications manager for editable templates of publications.  6.5.4.2.  If doing a rewrite, the previous final draft is a good starting point (found in the official record set in your office file plan, within the AFIMPT application, or from your publications manager). 6.5.4.3.  When the draft is complete, consider turning on line numbers in the draft prior to staffing.  This makes sorting and merging several coordination comment matrixes easier.   In Word® select Page Layout, Line Numbers, Continuous.   6.5.5.  Publication’s Front Page Header.  The following information has to be included as part of the publication header (see the first page of this document as an example for content, not format).  Publications not processed by AFDPO are formatted by the OPR to look like an AFDPO formatted publication (camera ready – use this publication as a template).  OPRs are required  to  use  the  information  detailed  below  to  create  publications.    OPRs  must  ensure draft  publications  (both  physical  and  electronic)  that  are  processed  by  AFDPO  contain  the following information at the beginning of the document in this order, flush left, no tabs, and single spaced. (T-1). 6.5.5.1.  BY ORDER OF THE (SECAF/command/base/wing/etc.). 6.5.5.2.  The publication type and number (e.g. Air Force Instruction 33-360, Air Force Instruction 33-360_AMCSUP). AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 59 6.5.5.3.  Place  holder  for  date (e.g., “(Date)”).   The final  publishing activity (AFDPO, local publication manager, or OPR) dates the publication the same day it is posted to the web site or made available for distribution.  The publication date is the effective date; Air Force publications are not considered effective until they are released to users IAW this publication.    With  proper  justification  publications  at  any  level  may  be  assigned  an “effective” date that falls in the future, but under no circumstances may publications be backdated. 6.5.5.4.  The AFSC series title, see Attachment 2. 6.5.5.5.  The publication title. 6.5.5.6.  The compliance statement: “COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY” if a directive publication. 6.5.5.7.  An  accessibility  statement  to  identify  where  the  publication  is  located  for distribution.  See Table 6.1 for examples of accessibility statements. Table 6.1.  Examples of Accessibility Statements. “ACCESSIBILITY: Publications and forms are available for downloading or ordering on the e-Publishing web site at www.e-Publishing.af.mil” “ACCESSIBILITY: This publication is only available directly from the OPR” “ACCESSIBILITY: This publication is available for downloading on the SIPRNet at www.#######.af.smil.mil” 6.5.5.8.  A releasability statement, which should specify any limitations on distribution.  See Table 6.2 for examples of releasability statements. Table 6.2.  Examples of Releasability Statements. “RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication” “RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication (or form) is restricted: this publication may be released to NATO members only” “RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication (or form) is restricted: this publication may not be released to foreign nationals” “RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication (or form) is restricted: this publication is classified (or insert CUI type) requests for access must be approved by the OPR”  “RELEASABILITY: Access to this publication (or form) is restricted” 6.5.5.9.  “OPR: (org/office symbol only)”. 6.5.5.10.  “Certified By: (insert org/office symbol and, in parenthesis, the certifier’s name that appears on the AF Form 673).” 6.5.5.11.  “Supersedes:  (include  the  number  and  date  of  all  publications  being superseded, separated by a semicolon),” if applicable. 6.5.5.12.  “Pages: (insert page count)”. 6.5.5.13.  AFDPO formatted Publications.  The Air Force Seal or corresponding Shield of the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU where the publication is approved is inserted during tagging – OPRs do not need to include the Seal or Shield in the draft publication.  All departmental 60 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 publications display the Air Force Seal in the upper left corner of the first page, with “BY ORDER  OF  THE  SECRETARY  OF  THE  AIR  FORCE”  written  above  the  Seal.  Command/field  publications  do  not  use  the  Air  Force  Seal,  unless  issuing  an  integrated supplement  to  a  departmental  publication.    All  command/field  publications,  except integrated  supplements the  appropriate MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Shield in the upper left corner of the first page, with “BY ORDER OF  THE  (MAJCOM/FOA/DRU)  COMMANDER  or  DIRECTOR”  written  above  the Shield.    Note:  MAJCOMs  may  approve  subordinate  field  organizations  to  use  their unique  Shield  on  their  site  specific  publications.    However,  MAJCOM  Publication Managers ensure an electronic copy of the approved Shield is provided to AFDPO for the publications they process. to  departmental  publications,  display 6.5.6.  Opening  Paragraph.  The  publication  starts  with  a  concise  purpose  statement  that cites the antecedent publication(s), explains what the publication covers, to whom it applies, and other required sections as detailed below.  Do not include policy/guidance statements in the opening paragraph.   If implementing a  DoD  issuance, show the type  implemented after “DoD” (e.g., DoD Directive or DoD Instruction) and include the number and title.  The AF publication OPR shall ensure the publication includes a complete opening paragraph.  (T-1).  A complete opening paragraph includes:  6.5.6.1.  Implemented Policy/Guidance/HHQ Publication.  The first sentence needs to identify  the  antecedent  publication  that  is  being  implemented.    Identify  only  those publications,  which to  be  reviewed  for compliance/accuracy; other publications that are referenced within the document should be included in Attachment 1, not here.  if  changed,  require  your  publication 6.5.6.2.  Applicability  Statement.    Identify  any  unique  applicability  conditions  (signed MOA/U, Support Agreement, etc.). (T-1).  Identify applicability to Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve. 6.5.6.3.  Legal Requirements Statement.  If applicable, note that failure to comply with the  publication  is  punishable  as  a  violation  of  Article  92,  of  the  UCMJ.   Indicate  if  the publication is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, subject to FOIA requirements, subject to  Paperwork Reduction Act  of 1995, contains copyrighted information, or is  subject  to other  statutory  requirements.    See  paragraph    1.7  for  guidance  on  obtaining  sample statements and addressing legal issues in the opening paragraph of the publication.  The servicing legal office should be participating early in the writing of a punitive statement.  6.5.6.4.  Records  Management  Statement.    Include  the  standard  records  management statement:  “Ensure  that  all  records  created  as  a  result  of  processes  prescribed  in  this publication  are  maintained  IAW  Air  Force  Manual  (AFMAN)  33-363,  Management  of Records,  and  disposed  of  IAW  Air  Force  Records  Information  Management  System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)”, or any updated statement provided by the AF Records Management office (SAF/CIO A6P).   6.5.6.5.  Recommending  Changes  Statement.    Include  a  statement  for  recommending changes,   For  example,  “Refer recommended  changes  and  questions  about  this  publication  to  the  Office  of  Primary Responsibility  (OPR)  using  the  AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of including  any  necessary  routing instructions. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 61 Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command.” 6.5.6.6.  Allow Implementing/Supplementing Publications Statement. (T-1). 6.5.6.6.1.  The  OPR  for  the  HHQ  publication  (parent)  determines  if  implementing activities  need  to  create  supplements  or  separate  publications  for  their  organization-specific  guidance.    Supplementary  guidance  (which  includes  supplements  and separate publications) cannot be less restrictive than the parent publication, but it can be  more  restrictive.   Supplementary  guidance  cannot  contradict  the  parent publication.  6.5.6.6.2.  Include  a  statement  in  the  opening  paragraph  as  to  whether  or  not subordinate  units  need  to  send  implementing  or  supplementing  publications  to  the higher  headquarters  OPR  for  review  and  coordination  before  publishing.    OPRs  are highly encouraged to  review lower-level  supplements/implementing publications for conflicting material, less restrictive guidance, and for possible incorporation into the higher  headquarters  publication.    Examples  of  statements  include,  “This  publication may be supplemented at any level, but all Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this  publication  for  coordination  prior  to  certification  and  approval.”  or  “This publication may not be supplemented or further implemented/extended.” 6.5.6.7.  Waiver  Authority  Statement.    Include  a  statement  in  the  opening  paragraph regarding  waiver  authority.    Example:  “The  authorities  to  waive  wing/unit  level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following  the  compliance  statement.    See  AFI  33-360,  Publications  and  Forms Management,  for  a  description  of  the  authorities  associated  with  the  Tier  numbers.  Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval  authority,  or  alternately,  to  the  Publication  OPR  for  non-tiered  compliance items.”  A reference to an internal paragraph that contains the authority and directions is also permitted. (T-1). 6.5.6.8.  Trade  Names  and  Trademarks.  When using a trade name or  mark of a non-Federal/government  entity,  include  the  following  disclaimer  as  the  last  sentence  in  the publication’s  opening  paragraph:  “The  use  of  the  name  or  mark  of  any  specific manufacturer,  commercial  product,  commodity,  or  service  in  this  publication  does  not imply endorsement by the Air Force.”  Refer to paragraph  1.12.6 for additional guidance. (T-1). 6.5.7.  Summary  of  Changes.  OPRs shall ensure a summary of changes is included for all ICs  and  rewritten  publications.  (T-1).    The  summary  of  changes  will  cite  major  changes: content  changes;  new,  revised,  or  obsolete  forms;  new,  revised,  or  rescinded  recurring reports; etc.  Place the summary of changes immediately after the opening paragraph. (T-1). 6.5.7.1.  Consider starting with: “This document has been substantially revised and needs to be completely reviewed. Major changes include (insert summary of major changes).” 6.5.7.2.  Include  one  of  these  statements  as  the  last  sentence  when  making  an  IC  (not when  issuing  a  rewrite):  “A  margin  bar  (|)  indicates  newly  revised  material.”,  or  “An asterisk (*) indicates newly revised material” for Supplements to DoD Issuances.  Note: Do not include a summary of changes for ACs or new publications. 62 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 6.5.8.  Forewords.  OPRs  ensure  only  nondirective  publications  may  have  a  foreword  to provide a personal message from a proponent.  Limit the foreword to one unnumbered page preceding the title (first) page.  Signatures are not required on forewords. (T-1). 6.5.9.  Table  of  Contents.  AFDPO  will  generate  a  table  of  contents  for  electronic publications  that  are  processed  by  AFDPO  and  posted  on  the  e-Publishing  web  site  for publications  that  are  20  pages  or  more.    OPRs  for  publications  not  processed/tagged  by AFDPO  (classified,  non-electronic  printed,  and  those  issued  below  the  wing/base,  or  by ANG  wings/subunits)  will  add  a  table  of  contents  for  publications  over  20  pages.  (T-1).  Include  chapter  titles,  section  titles,  sub-section  titles  as  desired,  titles  for  figures  or  tables that appear within chapters, and attachments titles, as well as page numbers for all. 6.5.10.  Publication  Body.  When  drafting  new  publications  or  revising  existing  ones, authors  need  to  follow  the  Federal  Plain  Language  Guidelines  available  at  ,  as  appropriate.  Specialized language may be required depending on the intended audience, but language and content organization should be as clear as possible.  Key concepts of plain language to keep in mind are noted in Table 6.3. Table 6.3.  Plain Language Concepts. Be Clear Use plain language whenever possible; avoid jargon Avoid overuse of acronyms (if used, make certain they are established upon first use) Use the active voice Format your document so that it’s easy to read and understand Use table and figures if that’s the best way to show information Be Concise  Remove unnecessary words Write sentences with 20 words or fewer and that contain a single thought, action, etc. Be Specific Use seven sentences or fewer per paragraph Include only information that the reader must know Use words with precise meaning Include details that are directly relevant to the main point 6.5.10.1.  Paragraph  Numbering.    Number  all  paragraphs  and  subparagraphs  using  this publication  as  an  example.    AF  Supplements  to  DoD  Issuances  follow  the  numbering format of the supplemented DoD issuance.  OPRs must provide fully integrated camera-ready  copies  of  AF  Supplements  to  DoD  issuances  to  AFDPO  for  posting  to  the  e-Publishing website. (T-1).   AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 63 6.5.10.2.  Bullets.  6.5.10.2.1.  Directive  Publications.    Bullets  are  not  authorized  in  directive  type  Air Force publications (see Table 4.1 for list of publications), including ICs.  OPRs must ensure when updating an old publication with bulleted information, the bulleted items are replaced with numbered paragraphs (e.g. 2.14.1.1., 2.14.1.2., etc.). (T-1). 6.5.10.2.2.  Non Directive Publications.  When part of a numbered paragraph, bullets may  be  used  for  simple  lists  in  nondirective  type  Air  Force  publications  (AFPAM, DD, TTP, AFH, VA).  Sub-bullets are not allowed. 6.5.10.3.  Embedded figures and tables are to  be inserted where they appear in  the final version.    Provide  a  separate  source  graphic  file  for  each  figure  not  created  in  Word®.  Place  the  number  and  title  of  each  figure  or  table  directly  above  the  item  in  the publication.   Limit the use of unnecessary  color  and graphics to  help  minimize printing costs and the size of transmitted and posted files.  Work with your PM/FM to ensure your graphics are submitted properly. 6.5.10.4.  Overview/Background  Section.  (Optional).    Provide  a  concise  overview and/or background information.  6.5.10.5.  Policy Section (AFPDs only).  (Required for AFPDs).  Identify Air Force level policy  that  is  consistent  with  laws,  regulations,  and  leadership’s  direction.    The  policy section states the principles and/or goals and may define performance standards and other means by which the Air Force can evaluate success in implementing the policy.  6.5.10.5.1.  Policy statements should be as concise as possible; however, they should be written in sufficient detail to ensure the policies are clearly articulated. 6.5.10.5.2.  DO NOT include responsibilities in the policy section.  DO NOT include procedures  in  AFPDs.    One  typical  result  of  an  imprecise  policy  section  is  the improper  embedding  of  responsibilities.    As  a  result,  critical  responsibilities  are  not clearly assigned, which can lead to failure to perform them. 6.5.10.6.  Roles and Responsibilities Section. (Required).  6.5.10.6.1.  Identify the key officials who carry out the policy or guidance and list the overarching duties and obligations of each.  Responsibilities should be assigned to a position (commander, director, chief, etc.), NOT to the individual filling the position.  In assigning responsibilities, be specific but succinct.  DO NOT include procedures.  State what the official is responsible for doing, not how the official should do it.  By clearly aligning the responsibility with the official, the intent of the publication can be better accomplished.  Note: If just the office or organization is identified, the head of that office/organization is the responsible party.  6.5.10.6.2.  AFPDs.  The SECAF assigns responsibilities, as applicable, to HAF two-letter/digit  officials,  MAJCOM  Commanders,  and/or  AF  Component  Commanders.  Assigning responsibilities below this level is discouraged given it may unnecessarily hamper their activities/responsibilities, and circumvents his/her authority. to  efficiently  manage their  efforts the  key  officials in 64 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 6.5.10.7.  Core  Content.    Do  not  use  “Core  Content”  as  a  section  title  –  use  a  title describing  the  content  being  provided.    Guidance  and  detailed  procedures  are  written using command/active voice without jargon and using plain language.   6.5.10.7.1.  OPRs  ensure  that  directions  in  publications  are  clear,  understandable, measurable, and executable.  Identify “who must do what” if compliance is required.  If  the  content  is  informational  or  descriptive,  be  clear  by  using  words  that communicate  appropriately  (should,  may,  consider,  etc.).    Use  caution  when  simply removing terms like “shall”, “must”, and “will”  since the structure of  your sentence may still imply that compliance is required.   6.5.10.7.2.  The  OPR  may  structure  the  content  to  increase  understanding  and usability  by  the  target  audience.    See  Table  6.4  for  approved  publication  elements (chapters, volumes, sections, etc.).  Table 6.4.  Elements of a Publication. Note: The following elements are authorized for use in Air Force publications. Division Volumes Parts Chapters Sections Paragraphs Identification Number consecutively, using Arabic numerals; e.g., Volume 1, Volume 2, etc. Number consecutively, using Arabic numerals; e.g., Part 1, Part 2, etc. Number consecutively throughout the publication, using Arabic numerals; e.g., Chapter 1, Chapter 2, etc. Use capital letters in alphabetical order preceded by a numeral; e.g., Section 1A, Section 1B, Section 2A, Section 2B, etc., throughout the publication or within each chapter. Number consecutively throughout the publication, using Arabic numerals; e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.  For publications divided into chapters, use a two-part Arabic numeral.  The first numeral represents the chapter, the second represents the numerical sequence of the paragraph with the chapter, e.g., 1.1., 1.2., for the first chapter, 2.1., 2.2., for the second chapter, etc.  If only in sections, begin with 1 and number sequentially throughout the body.  Do not re-sequence in the next section. Subparagraphs Use Arabic numerals in sequence, separated by periods, progressing from the main paragraph number.  Note: These examples are for a publication with chapters. 1.1.1. for the first subparagraph.  1.1.1.1. for the first paragraph under the first subparagraph.  1.1.1.1.1. for the first paragraph under the first sub-paragraph, etc. Figures Use: Arabic numerals – Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, etc., consecutively in publications without chapters. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 65 Two-part Arabic numerals in publications with chapters; the first number identifies the chapter, and the second number identifies the figure sequence number within the chapter, e.g., Figure 1.1., Figure 2.1., etc.; and for figures within the attachment; e.g., Figure A1.1., Figure A1.2., etc., for figures in Attachment 1; and Figure A2.2., etc., for figures in Attachment 2. Tables Follow the procedures specified for figures. Attachments Number consecutively, using Arabic numerals; e.g., Attachment 1, Attachment 2, etc.  Paragraphs in attachments will take the first number from the number of the attachment; e.g., Attachment 3 would have paragraphs A3.1., A3.2., A3.3., etc.   Note: if attachments have sections, identify them as sections A1A, A1B, A1c, or A2B, A2C, etc. Official’s approving official’s 6.5.11.  Approving authentication/signature block is the last entry before the attachments.  There are to be no wet signatures on the publication; the Approving Official shall sign the AF Form 673 only. (T-1).  If  the  authority  to  sign  the  AF  Form  673  is  delegated,  the  authentication  on  the  actual publication remains that of the principal that delegated the authority. Authentication.  The 6.5.12.  Attachment.  OPRs must ensure publication attachments meet the following format requirements.  6.5.12.1.  Attachment  1,  GLOSSARY  OF  REFERENCES  AND  SUPPORTING INFORMATION.    OPRs  include  an  Attachment  1  that  lists  the  references,  forms, abbreviations  and  acronyms,  and  terms  used  within  the  publication.  (T-1).    Do  not  use paragraph numbering for this attachment.  Use the following section titles: 6.5.12.1.1.  References.  Format: Designator (abbreviation), number, title (italicized), and published date.  Recommend the references be listed in the order they appear in the text.  6.5.12.1.2.  Prescribed  Forms.    List  forms  for  which  this  is  the  parent  publication.  Format: Designator (abbreviation), number, title (italicized). 6.5.12.1.3.  Adopted  Forms.    List  forms  adopted  by  this  publication.    Format: Designator (abbreviation), number, title (italicized). 6.5.12.1.4.  Abbreviations  and  Acronyms.    List  abbreviations  and  acronyms  used within  the  publication  alphabetically.    Abbreviations  and  acronyms  are  spelled  out upon first use or single use within the text and then incorporated into Attachment 1. 6.5.12.1.5.  Terms.  Define terms used within the publication.  List alphabetically. 6.5.12.2.  Additional  Attachment.    Include  additional  attachments  as  necessary.    Use Arabic  numerals  in  sequence:  Attachment  2,  Attachment  3,  Attachment  4,  etc.  Paragraphs in attachments take the first number from the number of the attachment; e.g., Attachment  3  would  have  paragraph  A3.1,  A3.2,  A3.3,  etc.    Note:  If  attachments  have sections, identify them as sections A1A, A1B, A1C, or A2B, A2C, etc.   66 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 6.6.  General Rules. 6.6.1.  Citing  References.  OPRs  must  ensure  all  citations  within  AF  publications  meet  the following requirements and those outlined in Attachment 4. (T-1). 6.6.1.1.  Limit the use of references and ensure all references are directly applicable and listed  in  Attachment  1.  (T-1).    Do  not  use  indefinite  references  such  as  “in  current directives,”  “contained  in  existing  instructions,”  and  “as  prescribed  in  pertinent publications.”  (T-1).    Official  Air  Force  policy  and/or  guidance  are  issued  in  the publications described in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2 (T-1).  Therefore, do not reference the following:  a  draft  publication;  unofficial  policy  and/or  guidance  found  on  web  sites;  or classified information in an unclassified publication. (T-1). 6.6.1.2.  When Executive Orders (EOs), Public Laws, or other statutes have already been implemented by a DoD Issuance, use the DoD Issuance as the reference citation; e.g., use “DoDD  5400.7”  rather  than  “Title  5  United  States  Code  Section  552.”  (T-1).    Note: “DoD  Issuances”  include  DoDDs,  DoDIs,  other  DoD  publications,  and  their  changes.  However, when an Air Force publication directly implements a specific statute, it needs to  be  cited  accordingly.  (T-1).    Use  codified  citations  (United  States  Code)  when available, and if the provision is not codified, use the Public Law citation; e.g., use Public Law  98-191,  or  Title  41  United  States  Code  Sections  401-420.  (T-1).    Verify  proper statutory authority with the servicing legal office during coordination of the publication. 6.6.1.3.  Do not reference a DoD Issuance in an Air Force publication unless there is no Air Force implementing publication. (T-1).  Consider using the Issuances, Delegations of Authority,  and  Responsibilities  (IDAR)  Database  (www.idar.hq.af.mil)  to  determine which  Air  Force  publications  implement  a  given  DoD  Issuance.    If  no  Air  Force publication  exists,  cite  the  DoD  Issuance  number  and  include  the  full  reference  in Attachment  1  (designator,  number,  title,  and  date).  (T-1).    Citing  references  at  the appropriate  level  reduces  confusion  and  conflicts.    For  example,  AFPDs  implement DoDDs, so if the AFPD is cited as being implemented there is no need to cite the DoDD.  The  AFPD  may  provide  more  restrictive  policy  than  the  DoDD,  therefore  citing  the higher-level document could cause confusion/conflicts.  The same applies for DoDIs and AFIs. 6.6.1.4.  To  refer  to  another  Air  Force  publication  and/or  form,  cite  the  designator, number,  and  include  the  title  in  italics  at  first  use  (e.g.,  AFI  33-322,  Records Management Program; AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request). (T-1).    Thereafter,  refer  only  to  the  designator  and  number  (e.g.,  AFI  33-322  or  AF  Form 673). (T-1).  Include the full publication reference (designator, number, title, and date) in Attachment 1. (T-1). 6.6.1.5.  To  refer  to  an  organization  and/or  an  office  within  an  organization,  use  the below guidelines for publication and forms.  6.6.1.5.1.  Use  the  "Establishment  term"  when  referring  to  the  entire  organizational entity (Air Force, AMC, USAFE, etc.) (T-1). 6.6.1.5.2.  Use  the  HQ  prefix  only  when  referring  to  the  entire  HQ  unit  (staff)  only (HQ USAF, HQ AMC, HQ USAFE, HQ 3, etc.).  (T-1). AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 67 6.6.1.5.3.  When referring to a specific office within a HQ unit, use the Establishment term and office symbol separated by a virgule (AF/CC, SAF/AA, AMC/A3, etc.). (T-1). 6.6.2.  Notes. 6.6.2.1.  OPRs  may  use  “notes”  within  a  paragraph  to  explain  or  highlight  information.  The  word  “Note”  should  be  in  bold  followed  by  a  colon  (e.g.,  Note:  [insert  additional text]).    Notes  associated  with  tables,  figures,  or  illustrations  should  be  placed immediately below the graphic or, in the case of a table, in the last row of the table. 6.6.2.2.  Use footnotes or endnotes to  credit  a lengthy legal  cite,  a copyright  owner, the source of quoted materials,  or provide a lengthy  explanation/expansion on text  within a paragraph.  Endnotes should be placed before any attachments to the publication. 6.6.3.  Exceptions.  OPRs may identify “exceptions” within a paragraph to identify a case in which the cited rule does not apply.  The word “Exception” should be in bold followed by a colon  (e.g.,  Exception:  [insert  additional text]).  Exceptions associated with tables, figures, or illustrations should be placed immediately below the graphic or, in the case of a table, in the last row of the table.  6.6.4.  Using Figures (Illustrations). 6.6.4.1.  Requirements  of  Government  Printing  and  Binding  Regulations  are  as  follows: Use  illustrations  only  when  they  relate  to  Air  Force  business  and  are  in  the  public interest,  relate directly to the subject  matter, are in  good taste, and  are the smallest  size necessary.    Limit  the  use  of  color,  especially  for  publications  that  are  to  be  printed,  to control  the  cost.    OPRs  must  justify  the  use  of  color  on  printed  materials  using  an  AF Form 673. (T-1). 6.6.4.2.  OPRs will embed figures, tables not  created in Word®, and illustrations where they  are to  appear in  the final  version.  Place the caption  above the  graphic.  Provide  a separate  source  graphic  file  for  each  figure,  table,  or  illustration  not  created  in  Word® (e.g., .tif, .gif, .jpg, etc.), when submitting your publication for processing/posting. (T-1).  Work with your PM/FM to ensure your graphics are submitted properly. 6.6.5.  Tables.  Use  tables  to  clarify  procedures,  present  data,  and/or  to  explain  a  choice  of actions or set of conditions.  6.6.5.1.  A standard table is data arranged in columns.  The listed items are organized by some  criterion  such  as  alphabetical  or  numerical  order.    The  format  requirements  for standard  tables  are  not  rigid;  many  variations  are  possible,  depending  on  the  kind  of material you wish to place in a table.  Regardless of the variation used, columns and rows should  be  labeled  (titles,  numbers,  letters,  etc.)  to  facilitate  referencing  material  in  the table.  Tables found in Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 of this publication are examples of standard tables.  6.6.5.2.  A decision logic table (DLT) is  most useful when  you need to  explain a set  of actions that depend on a condition or set of conditions; or when a narrative description of possible  actions  would  be  complex  or  wordy.    There  are  three  elements  in  DLTs: conditions, actions, and requirements.  The conditions (the ifs in the if-then relationship) are the potential circumstances that influence decisions.  The actions (the thens in the if-68 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 then relationship) are the specific operations or tasks that need to be performed when the various conditions occur.  The requirements are the combined conditions and actions that make up decisions (if + then = requirement).  Each separate condition and action has to have its own requirement.  Table A3.1 in this publication is an example of a DLT. 6.6.5.3.  A specified action table (SAT) shows actions that are usually taken in a certain order but that do not depend on any condition.  If you just want to show a series of related actions  or  procedures,  use  a  SAT.    Table  A3.2  in  this  publication  is  an  example  of  a SAT. 6.6.6.  Tier  Waiver  Authority.  AF  publication  OPRs  must  ensure  each  unit  (wing,  or equivalent,  and  below;  DRU;  FOA)  compliance  item  is  identified  with  a  Tier  waiver authority number using  Table  1.1  (T-1).    Exception: Publications that are issued/approved below the T-3 level (Wing/DRU/FOA/CC) do not require tiering. 6.7.  Supplements. 6.7.1.  AF Supplements to DoD Issuances.   6.7.1.1.  To  create  an  integrated  supplement,  the  AF  OPR  contacts  the  OSD  OPR  to obtain  an  editable  version  of  the  DoD  publication.    The  AF  OPR  then  manually  inserts the AF added paragraphs/material into a Word® or PDF version of the published DoDD, DoDI, or DoDM. 6.7.1.2.  The  first  added  page(s)  of  an  AF  Supplement  include  a  publication  header (paragraph    6.5.5),  opening  paragraph  (paragraph    6.5.6),  and  summary  of  changes  (if applicable) (paragraph  6.5.7).   6.7.1.3.  OPRs  insert  “(Added)  (AF)”  between  each  new  paragraph  number  and  the content  (e.g.,  “4.1.1.  (Added)(AF)”)  when  supplementing  a  DoD  Issuance.    Paragraph numbering follows the existing schema used in the DoD Issuance.  Air Force content is not  inserted into or between sentences of the parent  DoD  Issuance text,  standalone new “(Added) (AF)” paragraphs are used.   6.7.1.4.  The AF approving authority’s authentication is inserted after the OSD official’s authentication.   6.7.1.5.  For standalone supplements, the OPRs submit only the AF added material.  6.7.1.6.  The OPR provides a fully formatted document for publishing.    6.7.2.  Command/Field Supplements to AF Supplements to DoD Issuances.  OPRs ensure all Command/Field Supplements to AF Supplements to DoD Issuances meet the requirements of this section.  6.7.2.1.  To create an integrated supplement, the OPR of the Command/Field Supplement contacts the OPR of the AF Supplement to obtain an editable version of the publication.  The OPR then manually inserts the added material into a Word® or PDF version of the published AF Supplement to the DoDD, DoDI, or DoDM.   6.7.2.2.  OPRs  insert  “(Added)”  and  the  command/field  acronym  between  each  new number  and  the  content  (e.g.,  “4.1.1.  (Added)(AMC)”)  when  supplementing  an  AF Supplement to a DoD Issuance. (T-1).  Paragraph numbering follows the existing schema used in the DoD Issuance. (T-1). AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 69 6.7.2.3.  The  command/field  approving  authority’s  authentication  is  inserted  after  the OSD official’s/AF official’s authentication.  (T-1). 6.7.2.4.  For standalone supplements, the OPRs submit only the added material. (T-1). 6.7.2.5.  The OPR provides a fully formatted document for publishing.  (T-1).  6.7.3.  Command/Field  Supplements  to  AF  Publications  (AFIs,  AFMANs,  etc.).    OPRs ensure  all  Command/Field  Supplements  to  AF  Publications  meet  the  requirements  of  this section.  6.7.3.1.  OPRs  submit  only  the  material  to  be  added  to  the  higher  headquarters publication including the paragraph numbers whether creating a standalone or integrated supplement.  (T-1).    OPR  must  identify  if  AFDPO  is  to  publish  as  an  integrated  or standalone supplement. (T-1).   6.7.3.2.  OPRs  insert  “Added”  between  each  new  paragraph,  figure,  table,  attachment number,  etc.,  and  the  content  (e.g.,  “4.1.1.  (Added)”).  (T-1).    The  AFDPO  formatting software adds the appropriate command/field acronym after “(Added)”.  6.7.3.3.  OPRs do not use the “Added” tag when the paragraph, figure, table, attachment, etc.,  number  already  exists  in  the  basic  publication.  (T-1).    Repeat  the  number  of  the entity  being  supplemented;  when  the  correct  acronym  is  inserted  during  processing,  the whole phrase “4.1.1. (AMC)” is considered a unique identifier even though the numerical digits exactly match the paragraph number being supplemented.  Numbering has to agree with  the  format  in  the  basic  publication;  e.g.,  publications  with  chapters:  Figure  2.1, Table 3.1, etc.; without chapters: Figure 1, Table 1, etc. (T-1). 6.8.  Air Force Policy Memorandum (AFPM) and Guidance Memorandum (GM). 6.8.1.  OPRs  may  obtain  editable  templates  of  AFPMs  or  GMs  within  AFIMPT  (under  the Template  tab)  or  from  their  local  publications  manager.    The  general  formatting  guidelines for an official memorandum in AFMAN 33-326 and HOI 33-3 apply as appropriate for the level of memorandum being issued.  6.8.1.1.  Subject  Line.  The  publication  OPRs  will  ensure  AFPMs  and  GMs  indicate  in the  subject  line  whether  they  are  an  Air  Force  Policy  Memorandum  or  Guidance Memorandum.  6.8.1.2.  Control  Number.  OPRs  request  AFPM  and  GM  control  numbers  from publication managers and place it above the date slot.   6.8.1.3.  Published Date.  The actual date on the AFPM or GM is inserted at the time of publication by the publishing authority.  6.8.2.  The First Paragraph.   6.8.2.1.  OPRs  ensure  all  AFGMs,  issued  from  the  HAF,  start  with  “By  Order  of  the Secretary  of  the  Air  Force”.    Command  and  Field  GMs  are  by  order  of  the  issuing commander/director  that  signs  the  GM  (“By  Order  of  the  Commander,  Air  Combat Command”).  6.8.2.2.  When modifying an existing publication, start with: “By Order of the Secretary of  the  Air  Force  (or  the  issuing  organizations  commander/director),  this  (Guidance  or 70 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 Policy)  Memorandum  immediately  implements  changes  to  (specify  the  publication  and include a short description of the policy/guidance being changed).  Compliance with this memorandum  is  mandatory.    To  the  extent  its  directions  are  inconsistent  with  other (insert  organization  level  being  issued  from  [Air  Force,  ACC,  319  ARW,  etc.]) publications, the information  herein  prevails  IAW AFI 33-360, Publications  and Forms Management.” 6.8.2.3.  When  no  publication  exists,  start  with:  “By  Order  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air Force  (or  the  issuing  organizations  commander/director),  this  (Guidance  or  Policy) Memorandum  is  the  first  instance  of  a  to-be  published  (insert  issuing  org  name  here) publication  that  (insert  subject  area  and  brief  rationale).

New  Publications  Only.  If  issuing  new  policy  or  guidance  publication,  include  a releasability  statement,  applicability  statement,  the  standard  records  management  statement and any other applicable standard statements described in paragraph  6.5  6.8.4.  The Last Paragraph.  OPRs ensure AFPMs and all GMs (HAF, command, and field level) end with one of the following statements (T-1): 6.8.4.1.  “This  Memorandum  becomes  void  after  one-year  has  elapsed  from  the  date  of this  Memorandum,  or  upon  publication  of  an  Interim  Change  or  rewrite  of  the  affected publication, whichever is earlier.” 6.8.4.2.  “This  Memorandum  becomes  void  after  one  year  has  elapsed  from  the  date  of this Memorandum, or upon publishing of a new publication permanently establishing this guidance[insert the new publication number and title if known], whichever is earlier.” 6.8.5.  Signature  Line.    Do  not  have  the  principal  sign  the  memorandum;  insert  only  an authentication/signature block just like any other publication.  The completed AF Form 673 serves as the approval to publish.  6.8.6.  Reissuing AFPMs/GMs.  AFPMs  and GMs may be reissued for an additional period of up to one-year if the policy/guidance has not been incorporated into an official publication within  the  timeframe  allowed.    OPRs  use  an  AF  Form  673,  obtaining  legal  review  (T-3), signatures of certifying and approving officials (T-1) for subsequent reissue/extension.  The OPR forwards the AFPM or GM and completed AF Form 673 to AFDPO for dating/posting. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 71 6.9.  Visual  Aids.  OPRs  ensure  VAs  meet  the  following  requirements.    VAs  have  unique formats.  However, they are numbered like instructions/manuals (series & control number), and identify the attributed directive publication, a releasability statement (no need for an accessibility statement), and a supersession line on permanent VAs; this information should be placed at the bottom  right  of  the  VA  if  space  allows.    In  some  cases,  placement  of  this  information  is impossible  due  to  the  small  size  of  some  VAs;  OPRs  should  try  to  design  VAs  to  include  this information unless doing so is impractical. (T-1). 6.10.  Standalone Base/Wing Level Publications. 6.10.1.  If a wing/base decides to issue standalone publications (those that are not integrated into HHQ publications (Supplements) or formatted by AFDPO (types listed in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2), then the wing/base OPR must provide a properly formatted/camera-ready version to AFDPO for posting. (T-3).  AFDPO does not format (tag) the publication because they do not require integration into higher or lower level publications.  AFDPO applies the effective date and post the publication to the e-Publishing web site.  6.10.2.  OPRs at the wing/base become responsible for providing any future updates to their standalone publications in the same fully-formatted, integrated, and camera-ready condition.  OPRs  integrate  ICs  and  attach  any  AC  or  GM  to  their  publications  before  submitting  them for publishing. 72 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 7 FORMAL COORDINATION 7.1.  Coordination.  Coordination is a process in which an OPR obtains endorsements to publish from  offices  with responsibilities, statutory/regulatory  review  requirements,  and  is  completed  prior  to  obtaining  certifying  and approving officials’ signatures on the AF Form 673.  interest/technical  expertise,  oversight functional through their  PCMs, from  which  coordination  should  be  obtained appropriate 7.1.1.  Commanders/Directors, offices/organizations for  a  draft publication/form, prior to certification and/or approval.  Table A3.1 can be used as a starting point  in  determining  appropriate  coordination.    The  table  is  not  all-inclusive;  but,  provides recommended coordinating offices for the subject areas identified.  A publication should be coordinated  with  all  offices  having  functional  interest/technical  expertise,  oversight responsibilities,  statutory/regulatory  review  requirements,  even  if  they  do  not  appear  in  the table. determine the 7.1.2.  OPRs  submit  publications  and  forms  to  two-letter/digit  organizations,  unless otherwise  directed  in  the  formal  coordination  table  provided  in  this  publication  or  other applicable directive guidance.  7.1.2.1.  Two-letter offices are responsible for ensuring the appropriate offices within the organization  review  and  coordinate  on  the  publication  and/or  form  and  for  providing  a consolidated response.  7.1.2.2.  The  consolidated  response  does  not  necessarily  have  to  carry  a  two-letter  level endorsement; the two-letter may designate a lower-level office within the organization to provide  the  response  and  endorse  the  coordination  request  (i.e.,  eSSS,  email,  TMT,  AF Form 673, AF Form 1768). 7.1.2.3.  If  an  organization  needs  more  time  for  coordination,  they  submit  a  request  for extension  to  the  OPR  on  or  prior  to  the  suspense  date,  otherwise  the  package  proceeds without delay. 7.1.2.4.  A  major  change  to  the  AF  Form  673  is  the  removal  of  the  digital  signature capability  from  the  coordination  section.    It  was  determined  that  there  is  no  need  for  a digital  signature  in  the  coordination  section  and  the  number  of  digital  signatures  added unnecessary  complexity  to  the  form.    The  transcribing  of  endorsements  from  emails, eSSS,  TMT  tasks,  memos,  and  other  methods  suffice  for  coordination  responses.  However, endorsers wishing to  "sign" the AF Form  673 electronically  may do so using the  "//SIGNED//"  annotation  in  front  of  the  signature  information  in  the  Coordinators column  (IAW  AFI  33-321,  Authentication  of  Air  Force  Records).    Procedures  for  the retention of records do not change. 7.1.3.  If  the  OPR  does  not  obtain  coordination  from  an  affected  office,  the  OPR  may  be required to  do  an immediate update if language in  the publication is  contested by an office that was not given the opportunity to coordinate.  AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 73 7.1.3.1.  If resolution cannot be reached at the OPR level, the OPR must grant a waiver to the affected office absolving them from complying with the contested language until the issue is resolved. (T-2).  7.1.3.2.  The  OPR  involves  the  servicing  legal  office  and  elevate  within  the  chain  of command as necessary to resolve contested guidance.  7.1.3.3.  If  the  contested  language  is  dictated  in  a  DoD  issuance,  the  Air  Force  OPR cannot  waive  the  DoD  requirement.    The  office  contesting  the  DoD  guidance  needs  to work with the Air Force OPR for the DoD issuance (see IDAR database for OPR listing - https://www.idar.hq.af.mil)  to  obtain  a  waiver  or  change  the  DoD  guidance;  send  a courtesy  copy  of  all  e-mail  correspondences  between  the  Air  Force  OPR  and  the  DoD OPR to the SAF/AAII Policy Branch workflow box (usaf.pentagon.saf-aa.mbx.saf-aaii-policy-branch-workflow@mail.mil). 7.1.4.  OPRs  must  ensure  a  completed  AF  Form  673  accompanies  the  final  draft  submitted for publication, although OPRs may collect coordination endorsements from, but not limited to, e-mail, an AF Form  1768 (SSS), eSSS in TMT, or the AF Form 673 (electronic or pen-and-ink signatures are acceptable) for draft publications. (T-1).  If endorsements are obtained simultaneously  (i.e.,  “shotgunned”),  or  on  separate/different  documents,  transcribe  the information onto the AF Form 673 and maintain original correspondence in the record.  The OPR  must  not  release  final  drafts  for  publishing  with  unresolved  (nonconcurrences)  or insufficient coordination.  7.1.5.  Coordination  standards  and  requirements  for  coordinating  classified  and  CUI publications  and  forms  are  the  same  as  those  for  unclassified  publications/forms.    Contact coordinating offices for instructions on routing sensitive/CUI and classified publications. 7.1.6.  AFPMs and GMs require immediate release because they address critical issues, they only require a legal review  (T-3), and signatures of certifying and approving officials (T-1) (the SECAF for AFPMs) on the AF Form 673.  OPRs need to  provide full justification for issuing this time sensitive policy/guidance on the AF Form 673 or staff package.  7.1.7.  OPRs/POCs  of  publication  actions,  which,  as  a  result  of  coordination,  incorporate substantive  or  critical  comments  into  the  coordinated  publication  draft,  must  obtain  a  legal sufficiency  review  of  the  “final”  product  by  the  supporting  legal  office  prior  to  forwarding for certifying and approval authority action. 7.2.  Suspense.  OPRs establish a reasonable suspense that reflects the complexity and size of the publication  being  coordinated.    Coordinators  should  be  given  a  minimum  of  two  weeks  to provide coordination.  7.2.1.  If  coordinating  offices  are  unable  to  meet  a  suspense  date,  submit  request  for extension  to  the  OPR  prior  to  the  given  suspense  date.    A  request  for  extension  needs  to include  rationale  and  estimated  completion  date.    The  publication  OPR  makes  a  good  faith effort to allow reasonable time for the office to respond based on the rationale provided.  See paragraph  7.4.3 for additional guidance on missed suspense. 7.2.2.  OPRs  should  allow  at  least  thirty  days  for  AFRC  units  and  ANG  wings/subunits  to respond when coordinating on publications issued below the AF/MAJCOM level. 74 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 7.3.  Comment  Matrix.  OPRs  will  provide  coordinators  with  a  comment  matrix  for  providing feedback.  (T-3).    The  comment  matrix  includes  columns  for  the  following  elements: organization, item number, type of comment (Administrative, Substantive, or Critical—include a legend  at  the  bottom  of  the  matrix),  page  number,  paragraph  number,  comment,  and  rationale.  Regardless of the type of coordination comment, coordinators designate a POC to work with the OPR  towards  resolution.    The  POC  designated  by  the  reviewer  may  not  be  a  contractor  or  an indirect-hire  foreign  national.    Coordinators  must  specify  one  of  the  following  types  of comments for each comment provided in a standard comment matrix. (T-3). 7.3.1.  Administrative comments address typographical, grammatical, and formatting errors.  7.3.2.  Substantive  comments  address  content  that  appears  to  be  unnecessary,  incorrect, misleading,  confusing,  or  inconsistent.    A  substantive  comment  is  usually  not  sufficient justification for a nonconcur, however, several  substantive comments, when taken together, may  be  grounds  for  a  nonconcurrence.  Coordinators  nonconcurring  with  just  substantive comments must clearly indicate which comments are the basis for the nonconcur. 7.3.3.  Critical  comments  are  warranted  for  major  deficiencies  and  preclude  the  final approval and publication of the document (i.e., result in a nonconcur).  Critical comments are those  that  identify  violations  of  the  law  or  contradictions  of  policy,  unnecessary  risks  to safety,  life,  limb,  or  AF  materiel;  waste  or  abuse  of  AF  appropriations;  imposition  of  an unreasonable  burden  on  AF  resources;  and  similar  issues.    Identification  of  a  critical comment is considered to be an automatic nonconcur by the coordinator. 7.4.  Types of Coordination Responses. 7.4.1.  Concur.  A coordinator concurs, from their perspective, with the content as written. 7.4.2.  Concur With Comment.  Comments are administrative or substantive and consist of changes  meant  to  improve  the  clarity  and  correctness  of  an  issuance.    Critical  comments conflict with an overall “Concur With Comment” response.  7.4.3.  Concur-No Response.  A coordinator has not requested an extension or responded to a request for coordination within the allotted coordination suspense period.  Exception: Not a valid response for legal review.  7.4.3.1.  The  OPR  provides  a  reasonable  suspense  and  makes  a  good  faith  effort  to determine  why  the  coordinator  has  not  responded.    The  efforts  on  the  part  of  the  OPR should  include  requesting  assistance  from  the  organization’s  PCM  or  publications management office or contacting the coordinator SME for the publication, if known.  The number of contacts needed depends upon the urgency of the publication action.  7.4.3.2.  The  OPR  shall  continue  with  the  approval  process  and  enters  “Concur-No Response”  next  to  the  coordinator  on  the  list  of  coordinating  officials  and  provides  an explanation in the staff package as to why it is appropriate for the signature authority to release the publication without the coordinator’s response. (T-3). 7.4.4.  Nonconcur.  Comments  may  be  a  combination  of  substantive  and  critical.    They should  be  labeled  and  grouped  accordingly  so  critical  comments  are  easily  distinguished.  Coordinators  must  specify  which  comments  (other  than  critical)  are  grounds  for  the  non-concurrence. (T-1). AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 75 7.4.5.  No  Comment.  A  coordinator  responds  to  a  request  for  coordination  but  does  not concur,  nonconcur,  or  comment.    This  response  signifies  the  coordinator  has  reviewed  the issuance and does not have an equity interest in it. 7.5.  What does Concurrence Mean?  In providing concurrence, coordinators agree to the contents  within  a  publication  or  form  from  a  functional  perspective.  Additionally, coordinators  are  agreeing  to  the  releasability  of  the  publication,  as  stated  by  the  OPR  in  the publication.    If  the  contents  or  purpose  of  a  publication  or  a  form  are  in  conflict  with  existing policy  or  guidance,  or  if  the  releasability  as  stated  in  the  publication  is  not  in  keeping  with guidance in AFI 16-1404, coordinators are required to provide feedback to the OPR accordingly. (T-1). 7.6.  Resolving  Comments.  OPRs  resolve  all  comments  before  submitting  the  publication  or form  for final  processing  and publishing.  The  OPR is  not  required to  resubmit/follow-up with the  coordinator  to  resolve  administrative  and/or  substantive  comments  for  “Concur  With Comment”.   OPRs must include a record of the resolution of comments within the record set for the publication/form. (T-1).  Recommend the OPR make a copy of resolved comments available for viewing on collaborative websites.  Resolving Non-Concurrences: 7.6.1.  Critical  and  some  substantive  comments  result  in  a  non-concurrence  and  need  to  be resolved between the concerned parties before a publication is approved and published.  7.6.2.  The  resolution  process  is  the  responsibility  of  the  publications  OPR,  including  the manner in which conducted. (T-1).  The process may consist of informal or formal exchanges by  phone,  e-mail,  and/or  memo;  meetings  and  working  groups.    If  the  OPR  is  unable  to resolve  the  comments,  they  are  to  elevate  the  issues  within  their  chain  of  command  (see paragraph  7.6.4 for departmental publications) for resolution.  (T-1).  Note: The OPR stays involved in the process even if elevated to a higher authority. (T-1). 7.6.3.  Resolution  of  a  non-concurrence  is  documented  by  the  coordinating  office’s  written withdrawal  of  the  non-concurrence,  endorsed  at  the  same  or  higher  level  as  the  original coordination,  or  as  delegated  in  the  original  coordination  response.    Exception:  When  the comments  leading  to  the  non-concurrence  are  accepted  in  full  and  incorporated  into  the publication,  no  withdrawal  of  the  non-concurrence  is  necessary.    However,  a  new  entry  on the AF Form 673 for the non-concurring office should be inserted that identifies resolution of the critical comments that led to the non-concur.   7.6.4.  Departmental level publications.  7.6.4.1.  When  certifying  and  approving  officials  are  within  the  same  HAF  two-letter organization, the approving official makes final decisions on resolution during impasses.  Follow procedures in paragraph  7.6.6 below. 7.6.4.2.  When certifying and approving officials are not within the same HAF two-letter organization, the certifying authority that has been given policy oversight by the SECAF in the antecedent AFPD makes final decisions to resolve impasses.   7.6.4.2.1.  If  the  OPR  cannot  resolve  the  coordinator’s  comment,  they  work  through their  chains  of  command  and  elevate  to  the  approving  authority  for  resolution  if necessary.   76 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 7.6.4.2.2.  If the non-concur is from the certifying official, the publication is not to be published until the certifying authority withdraws the non-concur.   7.6.4.2.3.  The OPR documents the impasse in a memorandum, or other written form, to  the  appropriate  authority.    Both  sides  of  the  comments/impasse  are  clearly  and succinctly  addressed  in  the  document  along  with  a  recommendation.    Note:  The documentation becomes part of the permanent record-set of the publication. 7.6.5.  Command/Field  level  publications.    The  approving  official  makes  final  decisions  on resolution during impasses.  (Note: When impasses involve a command/field supplement and the HHQ guidance being supplemented, the approving official for the HHQ publication is the resolving authority).  7.6.6.  If the OPR is  unable to  resolve a non-concurrence after  going through their chain  of command and involving the certifying official, the impasse is addressed in a memorandum, or  other  written  documentation,  to  the  approving  official  requesting  the  AF  Form  673  be signed.    Both  sides  of  the  comments  are  clearly  and  succinctly  addressed  in  the  document along with a recommendation for the approving authority.  The documentation becomes part of the permanent record-set of the publication. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 77 Chapter 8 CERTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 8.1.  Certification. 8.1.1.  “Certification”  is  the  act  of  endorsing  the  need  for  the  publication  within  the numbered publication subject series, and, if applicable, verifying consistency with AF policy and  assigned  responsibilities  in  HAF  MD,  antecedent  AFPD  and/or  implemented  higher headquarter publication.  This role is based on assigned responsibilities for functional  areas as delegated in HAF mission directives and/or Air Force policy directives. 8.1.2.  Once the required coordination is complete, the OPR obtains certification. 8.1.3.  OPR uses appropriate staffing vehicle (SSS, TMT, etc.) to obtain certifying official’s physical or digital signature on the AF Form 673. 8.1.4.  Certifying Official. 8.1.4.1.  Departmental Level (HAF). 8.1.4.1.1.  Policy Publications (AFPD, AFPM, AF Supp to DoDD).   8.1.4.1.1.1.  The  certifying  official  is  a  HAF  two-letter/digit  official  that  is responsible  for  a  specific  numbered  publication  series  (refer  to  Attachment  2), policy  development  and  implementation,  and/or  oversight  of  implementing guidance and procedural publications.   8.1.4.1.1.2.  For  example,  the  SAF/CIO  A6 is  the  lead  for  Information Management  (IM)  matters  as  delegated  in  HAF  MD  1-26,  Chief,  Information Dominance and Chief Information Officer, and develops IM policy in a 33-series AFPD.  The SAF/CIO A6 certifies the AFPD and the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) approves the AFPD.  All departmental publications that implement the AFPD will then be either certified or approved by the SAF/CIO A6.  8.1.4.1.2.  Guidance Publications/Forms (e.g., AFI, AFMAN, AFPAM, AFH, etc.). 8.1.4.1.2.1.  HAF three-letter official within publication approvers organization, if responsibility  for  development  and  enforcement  of  the  detailed  guidance  and procedures  in  the  publication  is  within  the  antecedent/implemented  AFPD’s certifying official’s organization and they will approve the publication.  8.1.4.1.2.2.  (Policy  Oversight  Certifier)  HAF  two-letter  that  certified  the antecedent/implemented  AFPD, for  development  and enforcement of the detailed guidance and procedures in the publication is outside of the  antecedent/implemented  AFPD’s  certifying  official’s  organization (different  HAF  two-letter).    The  other  HAF  two-letter  then  approves  the  AFI, AFMAN, etc. responsibility if 8.1.4.1.2.3.  Example  of  policy  oversight  certifier.    The  SAF/CIO  A6  is  the certifier  of  AFPD  33-3,  Information  Management,  and  has  oversight  of  IM functions.    In  AFPD  33-3,  SAF/AA  is  given  responsibility  to  develop  the  Air Force publications and forms program.  SAF/AA then develops AFI 33-360 (this 78 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 publication)  to  provide  detailed  guidance  and  procedures  to  implement  the  IM policy  in  AFPD  33-3.    Since  SAF/AA  is  responsible  for  those  details,  SAF/AA approves the publication, only after the SAF/CIO A6 reviews and certifies that it is consistent with AF policy in AFPD 33-3.   8.1.4.1.2.4.  Forms are certified by the same official that certified the prescribing publication. 8.1.4.1.3.  All  departmental  level  publications/forms,  and  actions  that  change  them are certified and approved by officials at the HAF level. 8.1.4.2.  Command/Field  Level  Publications/Forms AFDWPAM, SCOTTAFBVA, AFMC158, etc.).  (e.g.,  ACCI,  AFMCSUP, 8.1.4.2.1.  When possible, the  certifying official  should be one level above the  OPR and one level below the approving authority.  8.1.4.2.2.  If the official  one level above the OPR is the approval authority, then the director/head of the OPR may certify or the approval authority may sign as both the certifying and approving official.  8.1.5.  If  coordination  is  more  than  one  year  old  and  no  significant  changes  to  the  draft contents  have  been  made,  OPRs  must  state  on  the  AF  Form  673  that  no  re-coordination  is necessary  before  the  certifying  official  signs  the  form.    The  OPR  is  responsible  for  re-accomplishing coordination as necessary. (T-3). 8.2.  Approval. 8.2.1.  “Approval”  is  the  act  of  approving  the  release  of  publications  for  compliance  and enforcement  that  are  necessary,  attesting  to  currency  of  information,  and  consistency  with existing laws, policy, guidance and Air Force Mission.   8.2.2.  Once certification is completed, the OPR obtains approval. 8.2.3.  The  OPR  uses  appropriate  staffing  vehicle  (SSS,  e-mail,  etc.)  to  obtain  approving official’s manual or digital signature on the AF Form 673.  8.2.4.  Approving Official.  8.2.4.1.  Departmental Level Publications/Forms. 8.2.4.1.1.  Policy  Publications  (AFPD,  AFPM,  AF  Supp  to  DoDD).    The  SECAF approves all AFPDs, AF Supplement to DoDDs, and AFPMs.  8.2.4.1.2.  Guidance  Publications/Forms  (e.g.,  AFI,  AFMAN,  AFPAM,  AFH,  etc.).  Heads of HAF two-letter/digit offices, or in their absence, acting heads of HAF two-letter/digit offices, or their two-letter/digit deputy/assistant approve these publications and forms.  Exception: Approval of Doctrine is IAW AFI 10-1301. 8.2.4.2.  MAJCOM Publications/Forms.  Heads of functional two-letter/digit offices, or in  their  absence,  acting  heads  of  two-letter/digit  offices,  or  their  deputy  heads  approve these publications and forms.    Exception: MAJCOM Commanders may  move approval authority  up  to  their  level  by  annotating  such  in  their  MAJCOM  Supplement  to  this publication. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 79 8.2.4.3.

If authority has been delegated to sign the AF Form 673 the delegation letter has to be on  file  with  the  appropriate  publications  manager  or  a  copy  should  be  attached  to  the  final package. 8.2.6.  If  coordination  is  more  than  one  year  old  and  no  significant  changes  to  the  draft contents  have  been  made,  OPRs  must  state  on  the  AF  Form  673  that  no  re-coordination  is necessary  before  the  approving  official  signs  the  form.    If  significant  changes  have  been made, the OPR is responsible for re-accomplishing necessary coordination. (T-3). 8.2.7.  All  departmental  level  publications/forms,  and  actions  that  change  them,  must  be approved by officials at the HAF level. 8.2.8.  Forms are approved by the same official that approved the prescribing publication. 8.2.9.  The approving official may also serve as the certifying official. 80 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 9 DELIVERING FINALIZED PUBLICATIONS 9.1.  Processing Electronic Publications and Forms for Publishing. 9.1.1.  OPRs  shall  send  final  publication  or  form  packages  (new,  rewrite,  IC,  AC, AFPM/GM) to their PM/FM for publishing.

The link 9.1.4.  e-Publishing Web site. 9.1.4.1.  The  e-Publishing  web  site  is  an  unrestricted  public  accessible  web  site  and  is only approved for unclassified unrestricted content.  For restricted publications, only the unclassified,  unrestricted  details  are  available  (e.g.,  title,  OPR  information,  etc.).  Instructions on where and how to request access to restricted products are provided when the publication or form is selected.   9.1.4.2.  Publications and forms issued by organizations at and above the wing/base level (excluding ANG wings/subunits) are listed on the web site, AFDPO requires submissions IAW with AFMAN 33-361, Publishing Processes and Procedures. 9.1.5.  Warehouse  Management  System  (WMS).  WMS  is  maintained  by  AFDPO  and provides a restricted access web site for unclassified restricted access electronic publications and  forms  issued  by  organizations  at  and  above  the  wing/base  level  (excluding  ANG wings/subunits).    OPRs  may  allow  common  access  card  (CAC)  users  to  access  CUI publications  and  forms  from  this  site  as  appropriate.    OPRs  may  further  restrict  access  to individuals using an access control list.  Discuss options with your publications manager and identify any restrictions on the submission package to AFDPO.  9.1.6.  Processing classified and other restricted publications and forms.   9.1.6.1.  All personnel  are responsible for safeguarding information  and only processing unclassified and unrestricted information on the unclassified network.  9.1.6.2.  OPRs  will  submit  a  completed  AF  Form  673  for  their  classified  or  restricted access  publication  or  form  to  their  appropriate  publications  and  forms  manager.  (T-1).  Details from the form are used to list the publication or form in the Product Index on the e-Publishing web site. 9.1.7.  AFDPO and/or publications managers notify OPRs when their publications and forms are posted and effective. 9.2.  Processing Physical Products for Printing. 9.2.1.  OPRs must provide written justification to create or continue use of printed products. (T-1).    The  AF  is  encouraged  by  E.O.  13589  to  limit  the  publication  and  printing  of  hard AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 81 copy  documents  and  to  convert  existing/provide  information  in  an  electronic  format, whenever  practicable,  permitted  by  law,  and  consistent  with  applicable  records  retention requirements.   9.2.2.  The  OPR  will  submit  a  completed  GPO  Form  952,  Digital  Publishing  Information; AF  Form  673;  a  clean  printout;  disk;  and  any  additional  artwork  to  the  local  publications manager. (T-1).  Ask your PM/FM for help with filling out forms and/or identifying graphics requirements, if necessary. 9.2.3.  Printing  in  two  or  more  colors  generally  increases  costs.    All  PM/FM  ensure  that multicolor printing projects are necessary, that minimum color printing is used, and that the extra cost is justified.  Note: Avoid using excessive printing requirements (e.g. coated paper, embossing, die-cutting, foil stamping, etc.).  The OPR must justify use of multicolor printing and/or additional printing requirements in “Additional Information” on the AF Form 673. (T-2). 9.2.4.  If the OPR deems it is necessary, unrestricted physical products may be sold publicly.  The OPR must complete GPO Form  3868,  Notification of Intent to Publish, and provide to the local publications manager, who will process it through AFDPO/PPL. (T-2).  Sales to the public  are  handled  by  the  Department  of  Commerce,  National  Technical  Information Services (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161-0001. 9.2.5.  Physical  products  may  be  ordered  from  WMS  (which  is  accessed  through  the  e-Publishing  web  site)  or  directly  from  the  DLA  Document  Services  office.  Contact  your publications  manager  for  bulk  printing  of  electronic  products.    Note:  Funding  for  printing publishing products may be centralized within your local publishing function. 9.2.6.  The  OPR  may  request  distribution  to  a  limited  number  of  recipients  when  the publishing  action  (IC,  rewrite,  etc.)  is  processed  by  identifying  distribution  numbers  and recipients  in  the  “Additional  Information”  block  on  the  AF  Form  673.    Large  distribution requests are submitted as a separate action using WMS.  Please contact AFDPO for guidance on managing a distribution list using WMS. 82 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 10 RECORDS MANAGEMENT 10.1.  Creation  of  Records.  The  execution  of  processes  and  procedures  prescribed  in publications results in the creation of records that document the business of the Air Force.  10.1.1.  OPRs must ensure the RDS  accurately reflects disposition of all records created and collected  as  a  result  of  compliance  with  the  publications  they  author.  (T-1).    Contact  your local records manager/professional for assistance early to avoid delays in publishing.  10.1.2.  If  discrepancies  exist  in  the  RDS,  OPRs  should  follow  instructions  in  AFI  33-364, Records  Disposition-Procedures  and  Responsibilities,  and  AFMAN  33-363  to  update  the RDS. 10.1.3.  As  part  of  formal  coordination,  the  local  records  manager  will  check  the  processes prescribed  in  the  publication  against  the  RDS.  (T-3).    If  the  RDS  requires  modification, coordination may be delayed. 10.1.4.  Per AFMAN 33-363, electronic records are the media of choice for use, storage and maintenance for all records. 10.2.  The  Publication/Form  Record  Set.  As  OPRs  develop  or  revise  publications  or  forms, they  must  ensure  the  records  that  facilitated  the  approval  of  the  official  Air  Force  policy  or guidance  are  retained.  (T-1).    Electronic  records  are  to  be  used  where  approved  by  records managers/professionals.  Maintaining an accurate set of records that reflects the actions taken is a responsibility mandated in Title 44 U.S.C. § 3101. (T-0). 10.2.1.  The record set  for a publication is  maintained in  a separate file  from the record set for the prescribed form(s).  Additionally, if preferable, record sets for previous versions of a publication may be retired.  10.2.2.  Personnel responsible for maintaining records sets must follow guidance in AFI 33-364; AFMAN 33-363; and AFI 33-322 for making, maintaining, and disposing of records. 10.2.2.1.  OPRs at the HAF who develop publications are responsible for maintaining the official record sets.  OPR status may be delegated to the respective DRU/FOA. 10.2.2.2.  Command/Field  PM/FM,  in  conjunction  with  the  senior  communications  and information/knowledge  operations  manager,  will  determine  who  maintains  record  sets locally. (T-3). 10.2.2.3.  OPRs  for  departmental  publications  that  are  authored  by  commands  or  other field  units  maintain  the  record  set  for  that  publication  IAW  local  guidance  from  their PM/FM.  10.2.3.  Records  owners  maintain  a  file  arranged  numerically  by  subject  series  for  each publication and form that includes the following: (T-1). 10.2.3.1.  Records  for  AFPMs  and  GMs  are  maintained  as  publications.    Those  that  are converted into “permanent” publications become part of the record set for the permanent publication.  AFPMs and GMs that are not converted into permanent publications are still maintained in the same way as other publications.  AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 83 10.2.3.2.  The original AF Form 673.  AFDPO maintains a working copy of the AF Form 673  for  publications  developed  at  the  HAF  (includes  both  the  Air  Staff  and  the Secretariat)  for  their  own  records;  OPRs  for  departmental  publications  and  forms generated  at  the  HAF  are  responsible  for  maintaining  the  official  record  sets.  Command/Field OPRs developing departmental publications must maintain and/or retire the original AF Form 673 in the record set IAW local guidance from the PM/FM. (T-3).  When  a  publication  and  form(s)  are  circulated  for  coordination/action  on  the  same  AF Form 673 or AF Form 1768 (SSS), keep the original in the publication record set and a copy of that record in the form record set. 10.2.3.3.  Publications:  A  copy  of  the  published  version  of  the  publication  with  all revisions  (ICs,  ACs,  AFPM/GMs).    Note:  Rescinded,  superseded,  or  obsolete  versions are placed in inactive files and disposed of IAW the RDS and AFI 33-364. 10.2.3.4.  Forms: A copy of each published version of the form.  10.2.3.5.  All  documents  that  show  coordination,  comments,  and  other  actions,  such  as changes (ICs, ACs, form revisions, and rewrites), exemptions, waivers, suggestions, etc., for the publication. 10.2.3.6.  Copies  of  form-related  waivers  granted  and  system  form  approvals  (see paragraph  12.7.5). 10.2.3.7.  A  copy  of  each  AF  Form  673  and/or  AF  Form  399  used  during  periodic  and special reviews for the publication or form. 10.2.3.8.  Any  additional  forms  required  to  process  the  publication  (such  as  forms required when developing a printed product (DD 67, Form Processing Action Request), if making changes to a DoD form). 84 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 11 PUBLICATIONS MANAGEMENT 11.1.  Issuing Publication Numbers. 11.1.1.  If the publication is a rewrite, it typically bears the same series and control number as the superseded publication.  Exception: Publications being realigned under different AFPDs, or consolidated, may have new series and control numbers.   11.1.2.  If consolidating two or more publications, either use one of the publication numbers and  supersede  both,  or  request  a  new  control  number  and  supersede  both.    Note:  The customer  should  “own”  all  of  the  publications  or  have  written  concurrence  on  the consolidation from the owning organization(s).  Ensure the statement of concurrence clearly indicates  the  organization  that  owns  the  consolidated  publication.    Also  ensure  that  any implementing/supplementary  publications  are  updated  (via  IC  or  rewrite)  to  show  the  new publication number if the series or number of the parent publication changes. 11.1.3.  Numbering Departmental Publications.  Once the series has been identified, AFDPO creates and assigns a unique publication control number.  If the publication is to be a physical (printed) product and has a separate cover, the OPR places the series number and title on the cover as well as on the first page of the publication. 11.1.3.1.  AF  Supplements  to  DoD  Issuances  are  identified  by  both  the  DoD  Issuance number  and  an  AF  publication  number,  in  that  order.    AF  Supplements  to  DoDDs  are assigned an AFPD number, AF Supplements to DoDIs are assigned an AFI number, AF Supplements  to  DoD  Regulations  or  Manuals  are  assigned  an  AFMAN  number  (e.g., DoDD3000.7_AFPD10-42,  DoDM4525.8_AFMAN  33-306).    AFDPO  assigns  the control  number;  Supplements  are  posted  on  the  e-Publishing  web  site  under  the appropriate  subject  series  (e.g.,  DoDD3000.7_AFPD10-42  would  be  listed  on  the  e-Publishing web site under the 10 series).  11.1.3.2.  AFPMs and GMs not revising an existing policy or guidance publication (first instance of a NEW publication) are numbered using the year the AFPM/GM is published, the subject series number, and the number of the future publication (e.g., AFGM2012-33-599). An  AFPM or GM  revising an  existing publication is  numbered using the existing publication’s  control  number  first,  followed  by  the  appropriate  acronym,  year,  and number  (e.g.,  the  first  AFPM  revising  AFPD33-3  would  be  numbered  AFPD33-3_AFPM2012-01,  the  second  would  be  numbered  AFPD33-3_AFPM2012-02,  etc.).  Publication Managers initiate actions to remove expired or superseded AFPMs and GMs from  circulation.    AFPMs  and  GMs  may  be  reissued  for  a  period  up  to  one  year  if  the policy/guidance has not been incorporated into an official publication within the original timeframe  allowed.    OPRs  reissue  using  an  AF  Form  673,  obtaining  legal  review  and signatures  of  the  Certifying  and  Approving  Officials  for  the  subsequent  reissue.    The AFPM or GM number does not change when reissued, the reissued date is inserted below the  original  published  date  and  the  effective  period  text  within  the  memo  is  changed  if appropriate (if less than one-year).    AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 85 11.1.3.3.  Publications that further implement/augment the content of another publication should  have  consecutive  control  numbers  (e.g.  AFI  33-360  is  further  implemented  by AFMAN 33-361).  11.1.3.4.  Air  Force  supplements  to  DoD  Issuances  bear  the  DoD  number  and  an  Air Force publication number (e.g. DoDD5105.83_AFPD90-19; DoDI5000.68_AFI16-122). 11.1.3.5.  TTP numbering is coordinated and jointly assigned with the LeMay Center and the issuer. 11.1.4.  Command/Field  (MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/Base/Wing).    Once  the  series  has  been identified,  the  PM/FM  assigns  it  a  control  number.    Command/field  publications  are numbered  consecutively  under  the  subject  series  using  at  least  a  3-digit  control  number (some publications may have a 4-digit control number). 11.1.4.1.  OPRs  must  ensure  supplements  bear  the  higher  headquarters  designator  and number,  adding  the  field  acronym  to  the  end  and  “SUP”  (e.g.,  AFI33-360_AMCSUP, AFI33-360_AMCSUP_89AWSUP,  AFI33-360_89AWSUP  (if  no  AMC  supplement)). (T-1).    PM/FM  need  to  approve  all  numbers.    AFDPO  posts  supplements  on  the  e-Publishing web site under the appropriate subject series.  11.1.4.2.  GMs issuing new guidance that creates a new publication (not Supplement) are numbered consecutively  under the  appropriate subject  series  (e.g., ACCGM2013-33-01, AFMCGM2013-33-01,  etc.).    A  GM  that  amends  an  existing  publication  carries  the amended  or  supplemented  publication’s  number  followed  by  the  appropriate  acronym and  number  (e.g.,  the  first  GM  that  issues  guidance  amending  AFI33-360_ACCSUP would  be  numbered  AFI33-360_ACCSUP_ACCGM2013-01,  the  second  to  amend AFI33-  360_ACCSUP  would  be  numbered  AFI33-360_ACCSUP_ACCGM2013-02, etc.).    The  AFPM  or  GM  number  does  not  change  when  reissued,  the  reissued  date  is inserted below the original published date and the effective period text within the memo is changed if appropriate (if less than one-year).    11.1.4.3.  Supplements, and GMs creating new supplements, bear the higher headquarters designator and number,  adding the command/field acronym to the end and “SUP” (e.g., AFI33-360_AMCSUP,  AFI33-360_AMCSUP_89AWSUP,  AFI33-360_89AWSUP  (if AMC does not issue a supplement), AFI33-360_ACCSUP_ACCGM2013-01). 11.1.5.  Interim Changes.  PM/FM ensures the OPR numbers  ICs cumulatively (IC-1,  IC-2, IC-3, IC-4, IC-5). (T-3).  ICs may be spread out over a number of years; the assigned number should be cumulative, regardless of the year in which the IC is being accomplished. 11.1.6.  Classified  and  CUI  publications  and  forms.  Information  within  classified  and  CUI publications and forms are marked IAW this publication, AFI 16-1404 and Volumes 2 and 4 of DoDM 5200.01.  OPRs will ensure publications and forms numbers and titles are marked as described below: (T-0). 11.1.6.1.  The abbreviation of the highest overall security classification or CUI restriction within the publication or form is added to the end of the publication or form number: “-C” for Confidential, “-S” for Secret, and “-TS” for Top Secret; “-O” for FOUO. 86 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 11.1.6.2.  CUI publications and forms may be posted to the unclassified NIPRNET WMS web site that limits access to individuals with a valid DoD approved CAC credential and in accordance with DoDM 5200.01-V4 regarding access to CUI. 11.1.6.3.  For classified (C, S, TS) publications and forms, the unclassified title has “(U)” added to the end of the title to identify that it is unclassified.  If the title is classified, the words “Classified Title (U)” is used as the title. 11.2.  Posting Unclassified Publications and Forms on the e-Publishing Web site. 11.2.1.  With  the  exception  of  ANG  wings/subunits,  command/field  publication  managers will  submit  appropriate  publications/forms  for  release  on  the  e-Publishing  web  site  to AFDPO-PPP. (T-1). 11.2.2.  Publication  managers  submit  files  for  processing  via  the  approved  publishing  tool (AFIMPT).  A link to the approved publishing tool is located on the e-Publishing web site.   11.2.3.  ANG field publications are submitted to the local wing PM/FM fully formatted.  (T-3).  AFDPO does not process, post or format ANG field publications. 11.2.4.  After AFDPO processes the publication, it is posted to the e-Publishing web site and the PM/FM is notified.  AFDPO’s goal is to post products to the e-Publishing web site within 20 business days of being submitted to AFDPO.  "Priority" processing of publishing requests must  be  noted  at  the  time  of  submission  and  include  justification.    Note:  OPRs  are encouraged  to  notify  affected  staff  offices  when  a  publication  is  released,  revised,  or rescinded  and  posted  on  the  e-Publishing  web  site.    The  OPR  notice  should  include  a statement alerting recipients that related publications and/or processes may be affected. 11.2.5.  AFPMs  and  GMs  (HAF,  command,  and  field  level)  are  posted  to  the  e-Publishing web site under the appropriate subject series.  If an AFPM or a GM (HAF, command, or field level)  amends  an  existing  publication,  AFDPO  posts  the  AFPM  or  GM  “on  top”  of  the publication,  so  that  publication  users  can  view  the  AFPM  or  GM  at  the  beginning  of  the document. 11.2.6.  Corrective Actions.  AFDPO may correct processing errors and other administrative type errors to all posted publications/forms.  An AF Form 673 is not required for this action.  OPRs and/or local  PMs/FMs  may notify AFDPO of the need to  initiate a corrective action.  AFDPO must: 11.2.6.1.  Notify the publication/form OPR of the proposed action, if they did not initiate the action.  OPR retains the notification in official record set. 11.2.6.2.  Annotate the publication with “Corrective Actions applied on (insert date)” on the front page of the publication.   11.2.6.3.  Consider inserting a summary of corrective actions taken in new section titled “Summary  of  Corrective  Actions”  if  the  changes  are  extensive.  Insert  after  purpose statement and before any summary of changes. 11.2.6.4.  Units below the wing level  that  post their own publications to  local  web sites may take corrective actions as described above.    AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 87 11.3.  Posting Classified or Restricted Access Unclassified Publications or Forms. 11.3.1.  Classified.    Because  a  classified  departmental  publishing  site  is  not  yet  available, HAF  OPRs  and  command/field  publishing  activities  may  post  electronic  classified publications on the local headquarters SIPRNET sites, if appropriate.  11.3.2.  Controlled  Unclassified  Information.    CUI  electronic  publications  may  be  made available for downloading on AFDPO’s WMS or other approved locally managed web site.  The  WMS  web  site  can  restrict  access  to  CAC  holders  or  further  restrict  by  CAC  holders identified on an OPR provided access list.  Contact local security professional to help make accessibility/releasability determinations. 11.3.3.  Publications  managers  and  OPRs  should  review  options  before  submitting  final package to AFDPO for processing.   11.3.4.  Product  Index.    OPRs  must  ensure  publications  posted  on  SIPRNET  sites,  other publishing sites, or made available only from the OPR, are listed under an unclassified title in the Product Index on the e-Publishing web site. (T-1). 11.3.5.  AFDPO  does  not  automatically  schedule  classified  or  restricted  access  unclassified publications  or  forms  for  printing.    Printing  requests  to  AFDPO  include  justification  and funding.    11.4.  Posting Publications and Forms Issued Below the Wing or ANG Wings/Subunits. 11.4.1.  Publications  managers  will  distribute  local  publications/forms  using  approved  web sites or other approved methods. (T-3). 11.4.2.  Publications  and  forms  managers  will  maintain  a  product  index  of  all  applicable organizational publications and forms. (T-3). 11.5.  Special Publication Systems. 11.5.1.  Basis  for  Setting  up  a  Special  Publications  System.    Special  publications  exist  to fulfill  unique publishing requirements  for  a narrowly defined  audience.   These publications must  identify  in  the  opening  paragraph  their  linkage  with  a  parent  publication  listed  in  an AFSC series (e.g. Career Field Education and Training Plans [CFETP], see AFI 36-2201, Air Force  Training  Program,  Atch  2).  (T-1).    This  system  does  not  change  or  supersede  any directive publication, form, or report that a directive publication prescribes. (T-1).  11.5.2.  Establishing  a  Special  Publications  System.   Obtain  approval  to  create  a departmental-level  system  from  SAF/AAII  Policy  Branch.  (T-1).    Describe  the  proposed system,  including  the  type  of  publications  you  intend  to  issue,  publication  specifications, coordination,  certification,  approval  requirements,  approximate  cost,  and  proposed distribution.    Explain  why  regular  publications  are  not  suitable.    Reference  the  directive publication driving the need for the special publications system.  Any  form  that the special publications system  requires has to be prescribed in  the publication  establishing the special system.  Once approval  has been received, work with AFDPO or local PM/FM to  establish the publishing process.   88 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 11.6.  Establishing a Functional Publications Library (FPL). 11.6.1.  Commanders  of  organizations  involved  in  flight  operations  are  specifically authorized to establish and maintain FPLs, containing departmental and command/field-level publications.  The library  contains a copy of this publication and a Product  Index listing of included publications.   11.6.2.  FPLs  provide  a  link  to  electronic  publications  and  forms  available  on  the  e-Publishing  web  site.    Classified/CUI  publications  and  forms  may  be  posted  directly  to  an FPL or printed.   11.6.3.  Flight operations commanders may establish FPLs by providing written notification to the servicing publishing manager.  Notification should identify the activity responsible for the  library,  its  location,  and  appoint  a  primary  and  alternate  library  custodian.    Officials establishing  FPLs  will  ensure  custodians  are  properly  trained  on  publications  management. (T-3).  Custodians are responsible for ensuring FPL contents are both current and essential. (T-3). 11.6.4.  Availability  of  FPL  Publications.    Publications  kept  in  an  FPL  may  be  loaned  to authorized  persons  for  official  use,  pursuant  to  DoD  5400.7-R_AFMAN33-302.    Loaning publications is optional and depends on local needs.  Do not allow the general public to view, copy, or borrow any publication from an FPL (DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN33-302).  Since FPLs are not open to the public, CUI publications may be filed with other publications. 11.6.5.  Obtaining Publications.  Request paper-based publications from the DLA Document Services at  unit expense.  The e-Publishing web site provides a link to  the DLA Document Services web site for easy access to this bulk printing service. 11.6.6.  Maintaining  an  FPL.    FPL  custodians  will  review  product  announcements  and  the Product Index on the e-Publishing web site, and regularly review and inventory the contents of  the  FPL,  to  ensure  publications  contained  in  the  library  are  current  and  essential.  (T-3).  Dispose of custodial records according to guidance in AFI 33-322. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 89 Chapter 12 FORMS MANAGEMENT 12.1.  General  Form  Guidance.  This  section  establishes  Air  Force  guidance,  assigns responsibilities,  and  provides  specific  procedures  for  the  management  of  Air  Force  forms.    It applies  to  all  media  of  forms,  whether  paper  or  electronic.    It  covers  the  complete  lifecycle management  of  forms  from  creation,  distribution,  use,  review,  and  revision  to  cancellation.  Forms managers, OPRs, and POCs shall reduce or eliminate wherever possible the use of social security numbers (SSN) within AF forms IAW AFI 33-332. (T-0). 12.1.1.  Definition  of  a  Form.    Per  DoD  Instruction  7750.07,  DoD  Forms  Management Program,  a  form  is  a  fixed  arrangement  of  captioned  spaces  designed  for  entering  and extracting  prescribed  information.    Air  Force  forms  are  tools  used  for  the  collection, recording, and/or extraction of information whereby a predetermined set of data fields have been established and defined to meet a definitive Air Force purpose or objective.  Official Air Force form types are listed in Table 12.1  12.1.2.  OPRs and Form Managers must remove term “IMT” from all forms and publications as soon as possible; it may continue to appear until all publications and forms containing that reference are updated. (T-1). 12.1.3.  Units  must  adopt  and  use  forms  generated  at  higher-headquarters  (that  are  within their chain of command) whenever possible. (T-1). 12.1.4.  Waiver Requests.  See paragraph  1.9  12.2.  Types  of  Forms.  The type of form is determined by the scope of its intended use and is indicated by the form designation (e.g. AF Form 673, AFMC Form 226).  If the scope of users expands or contracts, the form should be redesignated and reprocessed as necessary. Table 12.1.  Types and Descriptions of Forms. Prescribed Forms. Type Departmental e.g.  AF Form 673 Command/Field e.g. AFMC Form 181  Headquarters/unit (HAF, MAJCOM, base, unit, etc.) Description A form used Air Force-wide or by more than one MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, Base, or Wing. Prescribed by a departmental publication (e.g., AFIs, AFMANs, etc.). Forms issued by a MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, base, or unit, for use within the organization and subordinate organizations.  Prescribed by a field-generated publication.  Forms that are issued for use within an organization. Prescribed by an operating instruction. Issued by HAF (Secretariat and Air Staff) Command/Field Unit HAF, Command/Field Unit 90 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 e.g. HAF Form Non-Prescribed Forms. OPRs supply instruction on non-prescribed forms as necessary; an accompanying memo is acceptable.  Exception: OPRs must manage as prescribed form if they solicit information covered by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, collect information from the public, require Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval (see AFI 33-324), or collect information covered by the Privacy Act. (T-0). Type Office Issued by All levels One-time Test All levels All levels Description Forms (checklists, worksheets, etc.) for use only within the originating directorate, division, branch, section or office. OPRs disseminate office forms. Forms that satisfy a one-time requirement, are not reused or reprinted, and are obsolete when the expiration date is met. The OPR distributes the forms directly to activities required to complete the project. Place “One-time” in parentheses following the form number and show the expiration date next to it (e.g., (One-time, Expires 31 December 2013)). Do not exceed the one-year expiration date.  OPRs disseminate one-time forms. Test forms are established to be used for a limited period of time so they may be evaluated before becoming permanent. Life of a test form may not exceed 1 year.  The OPR is responsible for converting these forms to a permanent form by no later than the expiration date. If not converted to a permanent form, they automatically become obsolete on the expiration date. State “Test” in parentheses following the form number and show the expiration date next to it (e.g., Test, Expires 20 January 2006). OPRs disseminate test forms. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 91 Morale, Welfare, Recreation and Services (MWRS) MWRS offices Forms used in the operation of the MWRS for internally imposed requirements.  Give forms management support to MWRS activities on a case-by-case basis. The MWRS activity pays any printing costs. Note: Some actions may require use of non-Air Force forms, such as DoD forms (DD forms), standard government forms (SFs), optional forms (OFs), General Services Administration forms (GSA forms), General Accounting Office forms (GAO forms), etc. Users should be instructed when use of non-Air Force forms are necessary. AFDPO may assist OPRs with other types of forms, but does not monitor forms posted on non-Air Force web sites. 12.3.  Items Not Managed as Forms (per guidance in DoDI 7750.  07): 12.3.1.  Forms used exclusively for cryptological activities. 12.3.2.  Forms used only once as part of a survey. 12.3.3.  Formatted documents that are largely narrative in nature where the space needed by respondents  to  furnish  the  desired  information  varies  substantially,  such  as  a  comment matrix,  worksheet,  classroom  evaluations,  or  permission  slip.    Exception:  Manage  these types of documents as prescribed forms if they solicit information covered by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, collect information from the public, or require Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval (see AFI 33-324). 12.3.4.  Formatted  documents  without  spaces  for  entering  information,  such  as  instruction sheets  and  bulletins,  pamphlets,  notices,  contract  clause  sheets,  placards,  certain  tags  and labels, pattern letters, guide letters, and form letters. 12.3.5.  Tools used for the collection, recording, and/or extraction of information whereby a predetermined  set  of  data  fields  have  been  established  and  defined  to  meet  a  definitive  AF purpose or objective that are not prescribed in an official publication or otherwise defined in this publication, such as login screens or meeting sign-in sheets. 12.4.  Official  Form Repository.  The e-Publishing web site is the official source for obtaining prescribed/adopted  forms  generated  by  Air  Force  OPRs,  both  electronic  and  physical,  with  the exception of ANG wing/subunit prescribed forms and those generated below the wing/base level.  CUI forms may be hosted on the WMS web site.  Because a classified departmental publishing site is not yet available, HAF OPRs and command/field publishing activities may post electronic classified forms on the local SIPRNET site.  OPRs must ensure all classified forms posted on a headquarters SIPRNET  site are listed under an unclassified title in  the Product  Index on the e-Publishing web site. (T-1). 12.4.1.  “Stocked and Issued” forms are distributed directly by the OPR.  The office symbol and  mailing  address  of  the  OPR  are  listed  after  the  form  title  in  the  Product  Index;  users submit requests directly to the OPR.  The OPR is responsible for informing AFDPO when a reprint is necessary. 92 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 12.4.2.  “Stocked  and  Used”  forms  are  distributed  by  the  OPR  only  within  the  primary organization, and used only by that activity.  The OPR is responsible for informing AFDPO when a reprint is necessary. 12.4.3.  ANG field forms are submitted to the local wing forms managers, and are not sent to AFDPO for processing or posting. 12.5.  Prescribing  a  Form.  A  new  form  and  the  prescribing  publication  are  published  and distributed simultaneously.  This is not the case for revised forms. The prescribing publication: 12.5.1.  Instructs organizations and individuals to use the form. 12.5.2.  Cites  the  form  designation,  number,  and  title,  (e.g.,  AF  Form  673,  Air  Force Publication/Form Action Request) the first time the form is mentioned.  Thereafter, only cite the designation and number (i.e., AF Form 673), unless the title would clarify the text. 12.5.3.  States the purpose of the form, how to complete it (if necessary), and how to submit it. 12.5.4.  Explains where to submit supply requests if the form is printed. 12.5.5.  Lists prescribed forms by form designation, number, and title in Attachment 1, under “Prescribed Forms” after the list of “References”, and on the AF Form 673.  Note: The first IC or rewrite of a publication moves the forms list from the last paragraph to Attachment 1.  If a Supplement is revised prior to the parent publication relocating the list, it is acceptable to have a list of forms in both locations, just do not list the form twice. 12.5.6.  Do not  include a copy of the prescribed  form(s) within the publication.  This  helps ensure version control, and may eliminate a need to update the publication each time a form is revised.  If it is necessary to show the form in the publication, identify as a figure and show sample entries only. 12.5.7.  The  prescribing  publication  does  not  need  to  be  revised  when  a  form  is  revised unless instructions related to the revised form need to be updated. 12.5.8.  OPRs must ensure if a form, at any level, collects personal information/data it must be prescribed in an official publication and managed IAW Privacy Act guidance (see AFI 33-332). (T-0). 12.6.  Creating  a  Form.  Forms  are  primarily  created  as  electronic  forms  and  should  not duplicate existing HHQ forms.  Forms managers and developers will use the Air Force centrally procured Adobe  LiveCycle Designer® software  to  develop forms.  (T-1).  The Air Force forms design standards are identified in Attachment 7.  12.6.1.  OPRs request a form control number from their supporting PM/FM.  Form numbers are assigned sequentially.  12.6.2.  OPRs  create  a  prototype.    Identify  all  necessary  data  fields  and  create  a  prototype form  using  desktop  software  (Excel©,  Word©,  etc.).    This  prototype  form  may  be  used during  coordination  and  the  final  version  is  designed  in  conjunction  with  the  supporting PM/FM.   AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 93 12.6.3.  Signatures on Forms.   12.6.3.1.  OPRs  determine  which  method  of  signature  collection  (written  or  electronic) will be used on their forms.  12.6.3.2.  The  electronic  signature  method  for  permanent  and  temporary  records,  as defined  in  AFI  33-321,  should  be  utilized  to  the  greatest  extent  possible,  unless  statute (law) requires a written (wet) signature. 12.6.3.3.  Each  data  collection  and  the  form  used  are  unique.    The  OPR  that  prescribes the  use  of  the  form  should  determine  how  critical  it  is  to  have  a  written  (wet)  or electronic  signature  on  the  collection/form  and  documents  those  signature  requirements in  the  prescribing  publication.  (T-1).    OPRs  should  consult  legal  counsel  for  legal sufficiency  advice  and  records  management  professionals  for  compliance  with  AFI  33-321 and AFMAN 33-363.  12.6.3.4.  The  standard  form  that  is  found  on  e-Publishing  website  is  developed  as  a standalone PDF  form/file that is  downloaded,  emailed, used from  the desktop, and then filed.  If the intent is to extract and centrally store the responses from the completed form electronically in a system of record or other approved information system, the following should be considered:   12.6.3.4.1.  The  digital  signature  integrity  if  not  filled  out,  stored  and  distributed properly may pose a risk.  In order to maintain the integrity of the digital signature, all digitally  signed documents  must be handled via  electronic means from  inception all the  way  to  whatever  information  system  is  storing/using  them,  e.g.,  the  Automated Records Management System (ARMS).  OPRs should make this clear to users in the prescribing publication and on the form itself.  12.6.3.4.2.  If  the  electronic  chain  is  broken  at  any  point,  e.g.,  a  form  with  a  digital signature is hard copied and scanned into a system, the digital signature metadata that electronically  accompanies  the  form  will  be  lost  and  the  integrity  of  the  digital signature may be invalid.  This may impact the legal sufficiency of the signature, but may not impact the validity of the collection/form.  If legal sufficiency is required, a written  (wet)  signature  over  the  printed  digital  signature  is  also  acceptable.    OPRs should  consult  legal  professionals  to  help  determine  the  criticality  of  the  signature based on the program/collection.   12.6.4.  Information Systems.  12.6.4.1.  Forms/data  collections  that  are  part  of  an  information  system  must  be developed  to  meet  the  requirements  outlined  in  this  instruction,  electronic/digital signature  integrity,  and  AFI  33-210,  Air  Force  Certification  and  Accreditation  (C&A) Program (AFCAP).  12.6.4.2.  AFDPO  works  with  system  developers  to  approve  Application  Program Interfaces (API) when needed and warranted.   12.6.5.  Form  Date.    The  publication/form  manager  assigns  the  date  to  match  the  day  the form is made available for use on e-Publishing website, local site, or within an information system.  94 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 12.6.6.  If the electronic version of a form differs from the prescribed official image, the form OPR and/or SAF/AAII Policy Branch has the right to reject it.  12.6.7.  OPRs  will  ensure  that  any  new  or  revised  forms,  as  of  the  date  of  this  publication, identify the prescribing publication on the actual form. (T-1).   12.7.  Adopting  a  Form.  Publications may direct  the use of an official form  that is  prescribed from  an  applicable  higher  level  Air  Force  or  other  government  publication.    Adopted  forms already exist and are available from the e-Publishing web site, the MDD, or, if adopting a form created  by  a  different  government  agency,  the  appropriate  agency’s  web  site.    You  may  refer users  to  the  prescribing  publication  for  instructions  on  completing  and  processing  the  form, adding additional instructions, if necessary.  To determine the prescribing publication of an Air Force form, click on the “information” icon in the form entry on the e-Publishing web site. 12.7.1.  Cite  the  form  designator  and  number  within  the  publication,  including  the  title  in italics at first use; include the full citation in Attachment 1, under “Adopted Forms” after the “Prescribed Forms” (e.g. AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request).  Note: The  first  IC  or  rewrite  of  a  publication  moves  the  forms  list  from  the  last  paragraph  to Attachment 1.  If a Supplement is revised prior to the parent publication relocating the list, it is acceptable to have a list of forms in both locations (however, do not list a form twice). 12.7.2.  An  adopted  form  created  by  another  government  agency  may  be  subject  to  that agency’s guidance. Work with the forms manager of the agency responsible for the form to ensure that the Air Force guidance/process aligns with that agency’s guidance/process.  12.7.3.  Using  an  adopted  form  for  a  purpose  not  intended  by  the  OPR,  or  altering  the appearance of an adopted form, requires written permission from the form’s OPR to alter the use of the form. 12.7.4.  Overprint (pre-fill  blocks with  standard information) an electronic or physical  form when  the  number  of  man-hours  saved  in  filling  in  the  form  justifies  the  extra  cost  of overprinting the fill-in data.  Do not alter lines or captions, or add blocks and captions to an existing form as this action is a revision of the original form design.  This guidance applies to both  physical  and  electronic  forms.    Insert  a  statement  at  the  bottom  of  overprinted  forms indicating  the  activity  responsible  for  the  overprinted  material  (e.g.,  “919  MDS  Modified Overprint.”). 12.7.5.  Functional  areas  implementing  information  systems  that  incorporate  existing  forms obtain a written waiver to deviate from the OPR of the publication that prescribes the form.  If  approved,  the  system  maintainer  must  ensure  any  electronic  duplication  of  the  form replicates  to  the  highest  degree  possible  the  contents  (wording),  format  (layout),  and sequence  (arrangement)  of  the  official  form  (should  be  a  “mirror-like  image”).  (T-2).    The accuracy of the electronic form is the responsibility of the system maintainer duplicating the official  form.    Forms  management  offices  should  be  involved  in  electronic  transaction projects to ensure forms are properly created.   12.8.  Records Management.  See Chapter 10.     AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 95 12.9.  Legal and Security Requirements and Considerations. 12.9.1.  Privacy  Act  of  1974.    OPRs  must  ensure  forms  that  collect  personal  data  from individuals  for  inclusion  in  a  Privacy  Act  (PA)  system  of  records  (a  collection  of  records retrieved  by  an  individual’s  name  or  personal  identifier),  and  forms  that  request  the individual to enter or verify a social security number, have a Privacy Act Statement (PAS). (T-0).    The  PAS  allows  the  individual  completing  the  form  to  make  an  informed  decision about  whether  to  furnish  the  information.    The  use  of  social  security  numbers  within  AF forms should be reduced or eliminated wherever possible IAW AFI 33-332.  Coordinate all proposed  new  or  revised  forms  that  collect  personal  data  with  the  Privacy  Act Officer/Manager  (PAO/PAM)  and/or  servicing  legal  office  on  the  AF  Form  673.  The PAO/PAM assists with developing the PAS. 12.9.1.1.  Attachment 7 details how to display the PAS. 12.9.1.2.  Computer Matching Program.  Computer matching is the electronic comparison of  records  from  two  or  more  automated  systems  between  Federal  agencies,  state,  and local  governments  for  verifying  benefits,  eligibility,  and  for  debt  collection  purposes.  Records involved include those from personnel  and payroll  systems  and Federal benefit programs.  If the information on the form is subject to computer matching, incorporate an appropriate warning into the PAS. 12.9.1.3.  Form  managers  will  not  process  forms  that  collect  Personal  Identifiable Information the  PAO/PAMs coordination/approval. (T-1).  The publishing package includes the PAO/PAM accepted SSN justification letter, IAW AFI 33-332. publishing  without for (to include  SSN) 12.9.2.  United  States  Postal  Service  (USPS)  Requirements.    Forms  managers  must  ensure forms  used  as  mailers  meet  USPS  requirements.    Refer  to  DoDM4525.8_AFMAN33-306, DoD Official Mail Manual, for requirements. (T-0). 12.9.3.  Complying  with  Section  508  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973.    Forms  managers must  ensure  all  forms  are  Section  508  compliant,  as  established  in  AFI  33-393.  (T-0).  AFDPO  is  responsible  for  ensuring  all  products  posted  on  the  e-Publishing  web  site  are Section 508 compliant.  Local PM/FM are responsible for ensuring products not posted to the e-Publishing web site are Section 508 compliant.  See AFI 33-115 for  guidance on making forms Section 508 compliant. 12.9.4.  Guidelines  for  Classified,  Accountable,  Storage  Safeguarded,  and  FOUO  forms.  Anyone  requesting  the  creation  of  these  forms  should  ensure  the  forms  have  the  required markings  (see  AFI  16-1404  and  DoDM  5200.01  Volumes  1,  2,  &  4,  Information  Security Program).    AFDPO  identifies  these  forms  in  the  numerical  listing  on  the  e-Publishing  web site. 12.9.4.1.  Classified Forms.  Avoid creating forms that disclose classified information or contain  classified  titles.    When  a  form  title  is  classified,  create  an  unclassified  title  for reference  purposes.    When  designing  a  classified  blank  form,  show  the  overall classification  of  the  information  at  the  top  and  bottom  of  the  form  design.    If  the  form becomes  classified  when  filled  in,  leave  sufficient  space  for  the  overall  classification marking  by  adding  the  notation  "When  Filled  In"  outside  the  margins  at  the  top  and bottom  of  each  page  of  the  form.    Allow  space  for  entering  associated  markings, 96 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 classification  authority,  and  downgrading  or  declassification  instructions  if  deemed necessary by the requester. 12.9.4.2.  Accountable  Forms.    Some  blank  forms  can  jeopardize  installation/national security  or  could  be  used  to  defraud  or  allow  false  claims  against  the  Government; therefore, forms managers must ensure all accountable forms are controlled, safeguarded and  properly  accounted  for.  (T-1).    Contact  AFDPO  for  further  guidance  on  handling accountable forms (usaf.pentagon.saf-aa.mbx.afdpo-ppp@mail.mil). 12.9.4.3.  Storing Safeguarded Forms.  Safeguarded forms are not releasable outside DoD because  they  could  be  put  to  unauthorized  or  fraudulent  use  (e.g.  AF  688A,  Security Forces  Investigator  Credentials).    You  need  not  account  for  each  individual  form,  but store blank safeguarded forms in a secure area.  Contact AFDPO for further guidance on storing safeguarded forms (usaf.pentagon.saf-aa.mbx.afdpo-ppp@mail.mil). 12.9.4.4.  FOR  OFFICIAL  USE  ONLY  Forms.    Personnel  must  mark  and  protect  these forms IAW DoDM 5200.01-V4. (T-0). 12.9.5.  Forms  managers  must  ensure  that  forms  used  to  collect  information  internal  or external  to  the  Air  Force  comply  with  the  guidance  provided  in  AFI  33-324,  regarding  the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. (T-0). 12.10.  Coordination.  OPRs  must  coordinate  all  new  forms,  revised  forms,  and  those  marked for cancellation. (T-3). 12.10.1.  Drafts  of  new  forms  should  circulate  with  the  prescribing  publication  for coordination.    If  only  the  form  requires  revision  or  is  marked  for  cancellation,  you  may circulate  your  form  independently  of  the  prescribing  publication;  see  paragraph    A3.2  and Table A3.1 for list of coordinating offices. 12.10.1.1.  List all prescribed forms on the AF Form 673, and fill out blocks accordingly.  If prescribing multiple forms, make use of the “Additional Information” block to indicate classification, control status, and printing requirements for each. 12.10.1.2.  OPRs justify the need for the form, the data fields collected, and specify any printing and/or distribution requirements during coordination. 12.10.1.3.  OPRs  fill  out  form-specific  information  during  regular  periodic  reviews  or special out-of-cycle reviews.  12.10.2.  The DoD forms manager granted the Air Force an exception/waiver on January 22, 2013, allowing sole use of the AF Form 673 for all actions on Air Force forms.  Use of the DD 67 form is only required when action is taken on a non-Air Force form for which the Air Force serves as the OPR.  Submit an AF Form 673 for new, revised, or obsolete (marked for cancellation)  forms.    The  completed  AF  Form  673  and  the  form  are  submitted  to  the  local PM/FM for processing.  The HAF publishing manager for departmental forms is AFDPO.  12.10.2.1.  The  OPR  must  submit  a  completed  DD  Form  67,  Form  Processing  Action Request, to request an action on a DoD form for which the Air Force serves as the OPR.  DD  Form  67  is  prescribed  by  DoD  7750.7-M,  DoD  Forms  Management  Program Procedures Manual; refer to that publication and consult your PM/FM for instructions on completing DD Form 67. (T-0). AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 97 12.10.2.2.  The certification and approval officials for a form are the same as those for the prescribing publication. 12.11.  Revising a Form.  Changing a form is done by one of two ways; Revision or Corrective Action.  12.11.1.  Revision.  Forms are normally reviewed and revised/updated when the prescribing publication is being reviewed/updated.  However, you may process the form alone if needed.  Revised forms must meet any current/new design standards and are re-dated when published.  The Form OPR will ensure the following required steps are accomplished for an IC:  12.11.1.1.  Draft form prototype and collaborate with PCM and/or SMEs. 12.11.1.2.  Formal coordination.  See paragraph  A3.2 (T-1). 12.11.1.3.  Certifying Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1). 12.11.1.4.  Approving Official’s endorsement on AF Form 673. (T-1). 12.11.1.5.  Submit to publications/forms manager for final processing. (T-1). 12.11.2.  Corrective  Actions.  OPRs  may  work  directly  with  forms  designers  to  make Corrective  Actions  to  published  forms  (See  paragraph    11.2.6)  for  any  purely  technical “fixes”  (e.g.,  alignment  of  fields,  order  of  tabs,  enabling  for  digital  signatures,  critical spelling error, etc.).  12.11.2.1.  Technical fixes may not  alter the purpose of the form; forms  updated in  this manner  are  re-dated  and  require  a  supersession  line.    Submit  requests  for  Corrective Actions to forms designers using AFIMPT.  Changes to the purpose of the form are not within scope of a corrective action.    12.11.3.  The  OPR  must  ensure  that  any  alterations  to  the  form  are  also  reflected  in  the prescribing publication’s guidance. (T-3).  12.11.3.1.  OPRs  are  encouraged  to  notify  affected  staff  offices  when  a  form  is  revised and posted to the e-Publishing web site. 12.11.3.2.  OPRs  must  review  all  prescribed  forms  when  they  conduct  special  and periodic  reviews  of  the  prescribing  publication.  (T-3).    OPRs  are  asked  to  provide  the form status on an AF Form 673 generated by the publications/forms manger.  in  use  are  prescribed 12.12.  Rescinding  a  Form.  A form becomes obsolete when another form supersedes it, when the  OPR  rescinds  it,  or  when  the  prescribing  publication  is  rescinded.    OPRs  must  ensure  all forms  continuing   Obsolete publications/forms are listed in the Product Index.  Links to obsolete forms are removed from the e-Publishing web site and AFDPO releases a product announcement to notify subscribers of the cancellation.  ANG notifies subscribers of cancellations.  OPRs are encouraged to notify affected staff  offices  when  a  form  is  rescinded.    The  OPR  notice  should  include  a  statement  alerting recipients that related publications and/or processes may be affected. in  an  active  publication.  (T-3). 12.12.1.  If  you  are  canceling  the  prescribing  publication,  the  prescribed  form(s)  are automatically  canceled  at  the  same  time  –  it  is  not  necessary  to  submit  more  than  one  AF Form  673;  simply  clarify  in  the “Additional  Information” or “Prescribed Forms” block that AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 the  cancellation  applies  to  both  the  publication  and  the  form.    If  the  form  needs  to  be retained, the OPR link the form to a different prescribing publication in AFIMPT.    12.12.2.  If you are rescinding a form or a report but maintaining the prescribing publication, the OPR completes coordination (Attachment 3), obtains certification and approval, submits a completed AF Form 673 to the PM/FM, and sends a copy of the request for rescission to the  information  reports  management  and  control  office.    If  the  form  is  classified,  reference AFI 16-1404 for actions required to rescind. 12.12.3.

Publications  Formal  Coordination.  Commanders/Directors,  through  their  PCMs  (at HAF),  are  responsible  for  determining  the  appropriate  offices/organizations  from  which coordination  should  be  obtained  for  a  draft  publication/form,  prior  to  certification  and/or approval.    Table  A3.1 should  be used as  a starting point in determining  required coordination.  The  table  is  not  all-inclusive,  but  provides  recommended  coordinating  offices  for  the  subject areas/conditions  identified  in  Column  C.    Publications  should  be  coordinated  with  all offices/units  having  functional  interest/technical  expertise,  oversight  responsibilities,  and statutory/regulatory review requirements, even if they do not appear in the table.  OPRs give the offices listed at  Items 1-5 an opportunity to  review and provide coordination.  Base/wing level units coordinate with local offices. A3.2.  Forms  Formal  Coordination.  Ideally,  forms  should  be  packaged  with  the  prescribing publication and coordinated at the same time.  List the prescribed forms on the same AF Form 673 as the prescribing publication and provide narrative that identifies the form  changes in  the SSS.    If  the  form  is  being  changed  out  of  cycle  with  the  prescribing  pub,  use  Table  A3.1  to determine the appropriate offices for coordination.  SAF/CIO A6 (Command/Field equivalents – Item 2 in Table A3.1) is the only required coordinator for forms, however, OPRs should consider coordinating with offices listed in Table A3.1 and any office making approved use of the form in an information system. A3.3.  Coordinator’s  Addresses.    SAF/AAII  maintains  a  list  of  current  email  addresses  for coordinating  offices  on  their  SharePoint®  website.    Cut  and  paste  this  address  in  your  web browser:  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/af33360/SitePages/AFI%2033-360.aspx.   Formal Coordinators.

Attachment 5 PROCESSING GUIDES  OPR/POC 5-Step Guide to Publishing  Step 1 Research and draft new pub or proposed changes to existing publication/form. — Utilize SMEs, working groups, etc. to build your draft. — Contact Pub Change Manager (if assigned) to identify extent of change, action priority, and required coordinators. — Contact the issuing organization’s (Approver Official) publications/forms manager for a review of the proposed draft’s format, structure, and advice on action being taken. Step 2 Coordinate. — Use approved collaborative tools to staff package to required offices.  Include summary of changes and why, priority of processing, the draft publication/form, a blank comment matrix, and AF Form 673. — OPRs are permitted to coordinate pubs/forms using a SSS in lieu of the AF Form 673.  The staffing package doesn’t have to have the AF Form 673 attached.  However, the endorsements on the SSS for coordination must be transcribed to a master AF Form 673 prior to certification and approval. Step 3 Staff for Certification. — The Certifying Authority is at the issuing organization level and certifies the need for the publication/form and that it is consistent with implemented policies and/or guidance. — Staffing package must include an AF Form 673.  Package should reflect in the “View of Others” section if all comments were resolved or if non-concurs are still outstanding and require resolution. Step 4 Staff for Approval. — The Approving Authority is at the issuing level and is responsible for implementing policies and providing guidance/procedures pertaining to their functional area, specialty series, or command. — Staffing package must include an AF Form 673.  Package should reflect in the “View of Others” section if all comments were resolved or if non-concurs are still outstanding and require resolution. Step 5 Send to publications/forms manager (AFDPO for departmental pubs/forms) for Publishing. — Use AFIMPT to deliver package to PM/FM and AFDPO as required. — Final package includes completed AF Form 673, final draft in the correct format, figure files, and OPR and POC information. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 145   Action and Activity Cross Reference Matrix.   5noitan  Publications Action  4 New Rewrite IC AC AFPM/GM 1 Periodic review 6 Certify Current Rescind Transfer    Forms Action New Revise Periodic review6 Certify Current Rescind Transfer idrooC  X X X   3     X X      X X     X X  ngis laiciff OgniyfitreC  X X X  X   X X      X X   X X  ngi SRPO         X   X X              X X      ngis laiciff OgnivorppA  X X X 2 X    X X X   segnahCyllacisyhP  X X X       X             X X    X X X                1 - Must be followed up with new, rewrite, or IC action within one-year of publishing 2 - SAF/AA is the approving official for AC's to AFPDs and AF Supp to DODD 3 - Requires only legal review for all; add SAF/AA review for AFPMs only. 4 - SECAF is the approving official for all actions (except ACs) to AFPDs and AF Supp to DODDs.  5 - OPR, POC, and PCM collaborate to determine coordinators. 6 – Certify Current response requires completed AF Form 399 or 673.    dehcattameti  noitcA  robuP setaerC ro mroF  lacisyhpon - buPot   bupot edam segnahc        X X                              146 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 Attachment 6 RECOMMENDING IMPROVEMENTS TO AIR FORCE PUBLICATIONS A6.1.  Flight  Manual  Publications.  This  attachment  does  not  apply  to  flight  manual publications as specified in AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP). Changes to the AF Form 847 will be coordinated through the OPR for AFI 11-215 prior to publishing.  A6.2.  Recommending  Improvements.  Personnel  should  submit  recommended  changes  and improvements  to  Air  Force  publications  on  AF  Form  847.    Submit  emergency  reports  for conditions  that  require  immediate  correction  to  prevent  fatality,  serious  injury  to  personnel, extensive damage to  property or a  reduction in  operational  posture.  Submit  routine reports for conditions  that  have  negative  effects  on  operational  efficiency,  to  correct  content  errors  or  to recommend improved procedures or processes.  Do not use the AF Form 847 to call attention to word  omissions,  typographical,  printing  or  quality  errors  usually  corrected  during  scheduled reviews  unless  they  cause  misinterpretation.    See  Table  A6.1  for  detailed  instructions  on completing the AF Form 847. A6.3.  Processing AF Forms 847. A6.3.1.  OPRs must submit and process all NAF, base, wing, or unit level initiated AF Forms 847  through  MAJCOM  channels.  (T-1).    FOAs  and  DRUs  submit  AF  Forms  847  through their  parent  HAF  functional.    Submitting  organizations,  below  MAJCOM  level,  should forward  recommendations  to  the  MAJCOM  functional  OPR  for  the  publication.    For example, if the publication deals with a 36-XXX series instruction, the MAJCOM Functional would be MAJCOM/A1.  The submitting MAJCOM forwards approved recommendations to the appropriate OPR.  The final authority for accepting the recommendation is the Air Force publications OPR as listed on the front page of the publication.  However, the acceptance of the  recommendation  does  not  officially  change  the  publication.      The  OPR  initiates  and completes an IC, GM, or rewrite to change the publication/guidance.   A6.3.2.  The submitting MAJCOM forwards information copies of AF Forms 847 to all other MAJCOMs  that  utilize  the  AF  publication.    Using  MAJCOMs  forward  comments  on  AF Forms 847 suggestions to the OPR for the publication. A6.3.3.  Authority  for  disapproving  an  AF  Form  847  rests  with  the  submitting  units, MAJCOM and the OPR for the publication.  All disapproved recommendations are returned down  the  chain  with  justification  annotated  on  the  AF  Form  847  stating  the  reason  for  the disapproval. A6.3.4.  The  OPR  for  the  publication  notifies  the  submitting  MAJCOM  as  to  the  final disposition of the recommendation. A6.3.5.  Ensure  the  originator  is  informed  of  the  disposition  of  each  AF  Form  847  at  each level of the approval process.   AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 147   Block Details for AF Form 847.

Submitting unit assigned control number. Reserved for submitting MAJCOM control number. Publication number. Indicate if this is an Emergency or Safety Incident related AF Form 847 Full name of the publication Date of the basic publication. Date of the latest interim change (IC). Page number of the text or figure which the recommendation is based on. The major or sub paragraph title or number or figure number of the recommended change. N/A.  Flight Manuals only (See AFI 11-215). List the organizational OPR (located on the first page of the publication). Annotate this block if any supporting documents are attached. If supporting documents are attached they must be clearly legible and indicate what is incorrect or missing. N/A.  Flight Manuals only (See AFI 11-215). List the areas of text (or figure) where changes are proposed. List what the text (or figure) should read. Annotate “EMERGENCY RECOMMENDATION” if applicable, as the first entry. Fully explain and justify the rationale as to why the text or figure should be changed. The submitting individual must complete all the identification blocks at the bottom of the page. List the name and rank of the originator. Signature of originator. List organization of originator. List the DSN (or commercial) voice and FAX numbers of originator. List the full mailing address of the originator. List the e-mail address of originator. There are four levels (and sections) of review and coordination. Each level of review is allocated a Section on the backside of AF Form 847.  148 Section 1: Section 2: Section 3: Section 4:  AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 The first level is at the submitting organization, group/wing (or detachment) leadership. Indicate to whom the form is to be forwarded “To” (i.e. NAF or MAJCOM). Annotate the appropriate level of concurrence. If you agree with the intent, but not the wording, then mark “CONCUR WITH INTENT” and annotate the recommended wording in the remarks section.  If “Do Not Concur” is the selected action, the form is returned to the originator.  The second level of review is reserved for NAF. They comply with the same instruction as outlined above. If there is no NAF function then the second section is left blank. The third level of review is reserved for the MAJCOM Functional’s use. MAJCOMs assign their control number (i.e., AETC 01-130) in block 3 on the front side of the form.  The final level of review is reserved for the publication OPR.  The OPR reviews the change request and determines appropriate action.  The completion of this form does not constitute a formal change to the publication.  The OPR initiates an IC, GM, or rewrite of the publication to make any changes.  The OPR returns the completed form to the originator and retains a copy in the publication record-set. AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 149 Attachment 7 DESIGN OF FORMS  A7.1.  Design  Guidelines.    The  effectiveness  of  a  form  in  capturing  data  and  distributing information is dependent on the design of the form.  Forms should be designed so they are easy to  fill  in,  have  a  functional  layout  and  a  logical  sequence  to  the  information  they  collect,  and have  an  overall  superior  visual  appearance.    To  assist  in  the  design  of  forms,  the  guidelines  in GSA Handbook, Standard and Optional Forms Procedural Handbook, have been adopted for Air Force forms design and analysis.  A7.1.1.  Air  Force  Design  Guidelines.    This  Attachment  establishes  specific  guidelines  for the  design,  analysis,  and  typography  of  Air  Force  forms.  (T-3).    These  guidelines  shall  be applied  to  all  forms  (e.g.,  AF  Forms,  MAJCOM  forms,  Wing  forms).  (T-3).    Use  the following  design  guidelines  in  preparing  forms.    A  waiver  may  be  granted  when  a  special requirement or the functional use of the form precludes the use of these standards.  A7.1.1.1.  Form Size . A7.1.1.1.1.  If printed, forms shall be designed to 8.5 x 11 inches. (T-3). A7.1.1.1.2.  Postcard  forms  shall  measure  a  minimum  of  3.5  x  5  inches  and  a maximum of 4-1/4 x 6 inches. (T-3). A7.1.1.1.3.  Two-page  forms  are  not  required  to  be  printed  front  and  back  unless required by the OPR.  A7.1.1.2.  Form Borders/Margins . A7.1.1.2.1.  With  the  exception  of  certificates,  tags,  and  labels,  the  entire  body  of  a form shall be enclosed in a lined border. (T-3). A7.1.1.2.2.  Use a 1.5 point or 1/48 inch solid border for all four sides. (T-3). A7.1.1.2.3.  Unless the form has special requirements, use .5 inch page margins.  (T-3). A7.1.1.2.4.  Use 1 point or 1/72 inch solid lines for dividing primary sections. (T-3). A7.1.1.2.5.  Use hairline type for lines within sections. (T-3). A7.1.1.3.  Form Layout. A7.1.1.3.1.  Forms shall be designed in box style with fillable fields having upper-left captions. (T-3). A7.1.1.3.2.  Lay-out  and  number  items  in  sequential  order  of  fill-in.    Numbers  shall be in the upper-left corner immediately before the box caption. (T-3). A7.1.1.3.3.  Group  common  items  together  on  the  form.    Sections  may  be  used.    If several  data  elements  pertain  to  the  same  area,  individual,  etc.,  use  a  section.    The section title should be set flush-left margin.  A7.1.1.3.4.  In accordance with GSA Handbook, the National  Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requires a separate field or block from the signature field for the signer’s printed or typed name. (T-0). 150 AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 A7.1.1.3.5.  All  mailers  or  self-mailers  must  conform  to  current  USPS  regulations (e.g., forms requiring window envelopes, labels). (T-0). A7.1.1.4.  Form Font Styles.  A7.1.1.4.1.  Text  fonts  are  Arial  for  captions  and  Times  New  Roman  10-point  for fillers.  (See Table A7.1 for caption font size). (T-3). A7.1.1.4.2.  Use  comparable  italic  (optional)  for  words,  phrases,  or  instructions  in parentheses. (T-3). Table A7.1.  Font Styles for Forms.

If possible, place the title at the top or top left of the form, centered,  inside  the  border.    Ensure  the  title  is  brief,  specific,  and  meaningful.  Eliminate  any  unnecessary  words,  such  as  “form”  or  “label”.    If  the  form  does  not have  a  standard  margin,  place  the  title,  form  number,  and  edition  date  in  the  most logical place.  A7.1.1.5.2.  Form Number and Date on the First Page.  A7.1.1.5.2.1.  Place  the  form  number  and  edition  date  at  the  bottom  left  margin, outside the border. (T-3). A7.1.1.5.2.2.  Show  the  form  designation  in  full  capital  letters  to  indicate  the scope of use for the form (e.g., “AF,” “ACC,” “AFMC,” or “375 WG”). (T-3). A7.1.1.5.2.3.  Place the word “Form” following the form designation, followed by the form number (e.g., AF Form 673).  Form numbers are assigned sequentially as new forms are created. (T-3). A7.1.1.5.2.4.

Place  it  in  the  lower  left corner immediately following the form number. (T-3). AFI33-360  1 DECEMBER 2015 151 A7.1.1.5.3.  Form Number and Date on the Second Page.  If the form is to be printed front and back and stocked in paper, put the word “(Back)” after the edition date on the second page (e.g., “AF Form XXXX, 20150715 (Back)”).  If form is in electronic media only, use “Page ___ of ___” on the bottom right corner of the form.  A7.1.1.5.4.  Prescribing Publication.  Identify the prescribing publication on new and revised forms. (T-1).  Recommend that it be placed below the form control number in the footer or in the form’s title block.      A7.1.1.6.  Insert a releasability statement on the bottom of the form only if releasability is  restricted  (either  when  blank  or  when  filled  out).  (T-3).    Examples  of  releasability statements include “RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is restricted: this form may be  released  to  NATO  members  only”;  “RELEASABILITY:  Access  to  this  form  is restricted: foreign  nationals”; “RELEASABILITY:  Access  to  this  form  is  restricted:  this  form  is  classified/FOUO; requests for accessibility must be approved by the OPR,” etc.  The statement is prefaced with the phrase “RELEASABILITY: Access to this form is restricted”. this  publication  may  not  be released to A7.1.1.7.
