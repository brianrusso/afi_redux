Criterion Objective: Given a HAPSITE® (GC/MS), perform pre-operational check and operate instrument successfully completing all checklist items with NO trainer assistance. Notes: *The HAPSITE® is a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) proven to provide verifiable data for critical health-risk decisions. The HAPSITE® systems deliver fast, dependable on-site analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air, water, and soil for emergency response, environmental, hazardous waste, industrial hygiene, process monitoring, and medical applications. The HAPSITE® Headspace sampling system supports the HAPSITE® Smart Chemical Identification System in detecting and identifying VOCs in water or soil on-site or from another location.  INFICON recommends storing the HAPSITE® Smart in extended standby mode. This keeps the NEG (pump) operating at 400°C and the ion pump ON to maintain proper vacuum conditions. Extended standby ensures the battery is charged and ready for deployment/response. While extended standby is recommended, it is not a substitute for system use and it is not a feature to extend the time period between system operations. Using the system or running a weekly Blank Run is the best method to ensure overall operational readiness.  The Guidance Document (HAPSITE® Field Guide) referenced above is designed to provide user’s the capability to maximize the use of deployment technology at both garrison and deployed environments in both routine and emergency response situations.   Completion of this Craftsman QTP Training Module also satisfies Craftsman QTP Training 4.5.2.6.3.       1 AFQTP 4B071-16                             Craftsman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling TASK STEPS  START UP FROM STANDBY MODE: (These steps are ONLY for resuming use when the HAPSITE® has been placed in STANDBY MODE.) 1.

Utilize DOEHRS or equivalent as applicable.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES: 1.  Place hands on top of front panel, using thumbs, pull panel down and outward to open. Care should be taken not to tear the seal.  2. Insert instructions for canisters are located on the inside of the front panel and require the operator to press and hold the PUSH button located to the right of the containment area while inserting canister. With canister pushed in, release the button and this should engage the canister to stay in the containment area. If you can pull it out then it was not inserted properly.   3.  The battery is loaded in the opening to the left of the canisters. The INFICON name will be in the upper left corner of the battery and the TEST button in the upper right corner when the battery has been inserted correctly. When the HAPSITE® is in extended standby a battery should be in the machine. The battery will be recharged while in extended standby.  4.  Sample loop is located to the right of the canisters. When installing the Sample Loop do not over tighten.   6 AFQTP 4B071-16              5.  When tune check is complete, PRESS ANY BUTTON TO CONTINUE will appear at the top of the display screen. Any               Craftsman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling button you press on the HAPSITE® will cause the display window to show the MAIN MENU.   6.  TIC generally should be less than 200,000. If not, check area for inteferents such as chemicals that may be in the area.  7.  8.  Monitoring what a normal blank looks like is one step in verifying the operation of the HAPSITE® and determining if Instrument will continuously run until you stop it while in Survey Mode. there is a problem. If there are additional peaks in the blank spectrum, and they cannot be removed with additional blank runs, review your blank chromatogram, note the additional analytes, and contact the ESOH Service Center. It is important to blow out the ferrule chamber to ensure broken pieces of the chipped tube are not imbedded.  9.  10.  Clean-outs required.  11.  If there are additional peaks in the blank spectrum, and they cannot be removed with additional blank runs, AND they are not getting in the way of other analytes, note the additional analytes, and adjust your sample spectrum accordingly. Remember that in future samples, if the chemical that showed up in the blank run is sampled, there will be an increase in peak heights.  12.  The Headspace Performance Standard is a test of the HAPSITE® and Headspace connections using the Tri-bed concentrator.       7 AFQTP 4B071-16                            Craftsman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling PERFORMANCE CHECKLIST STS Line Item 4.15.3.5.1:  Portable GC/MS (HAPSITE®)   Proficiency Code: 3c PC Definition:  DID THE TRAINEE… Can do all parts of the task.

We cannot cover all of the tests in this QTP so we will concentrate on one test, the test for Chlorine using the Pour-Thru Cell method. This method is designed for clean water, low in color and turbidity. The main applications include monitoring for trace chlorine break-through of activated carbon beds and feedwater to reverse osmosis membranes or ion-exchange resins. Before starting the Chlorine test it must be noted that samples have be analyzed immediately. Samples containing chlorine cannot be preserved for later analysis. Additionally, be aware that ampules, in order to ease transfer, contain more than the 1.0 ml of solution needed. Discard excess reagent. Refer to the instrument USER MANUAL for Pour-Thru cell and module assembly and installation. The Task Steps below require that determining the blanking reagent value is completed while the DREL 2800™ is still on and the Pour-Thru Cell is still attached. To protect the Pour-Thru Cell from contamination when not in use by inverting a small beaker over the top of the glass funnel. See Treating Analysis Labware on page 6 of the DREL 2800™ Spectrophotometer PROCEDURES MANUAL.  13    AFQTP 4B071-16                              Craftsman Training Guide:  Water/Liquid Sampling TASK STEPS   Determining Level of Chlorine Using the Pour-Thru Cell Method 1.

Measure the reacted sample 3-4 minutes after mixing the sample and reagents. If less than three minutes elapses, the reaction with chloramines may be incomplete. A reading after four minutes may result in higher reagent blank values. 8.  Results are in µ/L chlorine.

The reagent blank value is most important to measure and subtract from test results when measuring low concentrations. For example, subtracting a reagent blank value of 0.02 µ/L from a test result of 0.06 µ/L changes the result by more than 30 percent. On the other hand, subtracting a reagent blank value of 0.02 µ/L from a result of 1.23 µ/L changes the results by less than 2 percent. 16.

We cannot cover all of the tests in this QTP so we will concentrate on one test, the test for Chlorine using the Pour-Thru Cell method. This method is designed for clean water, low in color and turbidity. The main applications include monitoring for trace chlorine break-through of activated carbon beds and feedwater to reverse osmosis membranes or ion-exchange resins. Before starting the Chlorine test it must be noted that samples have be analyzed immediately. Samples containing chlorine cannot be preserved for later analysis. Additionally, be aware that ampules, in order to ease transfer, contain more than the 1.0 ml of solution needed. Discard excess reagent. Refer to the instrument USER MANUAL for Pour-Thru cell and module assembly and installation. The Task Steps below require that determining the blanking reagent value is completed while the DREL 2800™ is still on and the Pour-Thru Cell is still attached. To protect the Pour-Thru Cell from contamination when not in use by inverting a small beaker over the top of the glass funnel.
