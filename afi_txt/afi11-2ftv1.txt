GENERAL INFORMATION. AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 1.1.  Purpose  .  The  AFMC  aircrew  training  program  objective  is  to  ensure  aircrews  are trained  appropriately  to  execute  AFMC’s  flight  test  mission  safely  and  effectively.  Ground and  flying  training  requirements  established  in  AFI  11-202  Vol  1,  AFMC  Sup,  Aircrew Training and this instruction apply to  all AFMC aircrew members and AFMC-gained units and  personnel  conducting  flying  operations.  AFMC  Small  Unmanned  Aerial  Systems operations  are  referenced  in  AFI  11-5FT  Vol  1,  Small  Unmanned  Aircraft  Systems  (SUAS) Flight  Test  Training.  This  instruction  does  not  apply  to  the  Air  National  Guard  or  US  Air Force Reserve units and members except those under AFMC ADCON. 1.1.1.  AFMC  publishes  two  distinct  three-volume  sets  of  Flight  Test  (FT)  instructions containing  attachments  for  each  weapon  system  flown  in  AFMC.  These  instructions, numbered AFI 11-2FT Volume 1, 2 and 3 and AFI 11-5FT Volume 1, 2 and 3, contain training,  evaluation  criteria  and  operations  procedures,  respectively,  for  each  weapon system.  AFMC  uses  these  instructions  in  lieu  of  AFI  11-2  MDS-Specific  volumes  for flying operations. In the absence of published guidance AFMC units will coordinate with AFMC/A3V  for  approval  of  locally  developed  guidelines.  These  guidelines  should  be consistent  with  similar  guidance  specified  in  the  appropriate  AFI  11-2  MD-Specific volumes.  In  addition,  aircraft  on  loan  to  AFMC  undergoing  short-term  flight  test programs  are  flown  according  to  the  lead  MAJCOM  guidance  if  no  AFMC  guidance exists. 1.2.  Supplements.  The flying unit will supplement this instruction if required to include: 1.2.1.  Training  for  aircraft  and/or  crew  positions  not  specifically  covered  in  this instruction. 1.2.2.  Ground and flying training requirements  needed to  qualify aircrews for the unit's mission. 1.2.3.  Ground  and  flying  training  requirements  needed  for  conversion  and  difference training. 1.2.4.  Local Area Operating procedures. 1.2.5.  The unit may direct additional required training not covered in this instruction in order to meet any unit specific requirements. The unit commander will publish  any unit specific  training  requirements  in  a  supplement  to  this  instruction.  All  original  and  any permanent  changes  to  the  content  of  the  supplement  must  be  approved  by  AFMC/A3V using  the  AFMC  Form  73,  AFMC  Waiver  and  Approval  Request,  process.  For  training plans associated with unit supplements, submit changes to AFMC/A3V using the AFMC Form 73 process. 1.2.6.  Send  unit  supplements  to  AFMC/A3V  via  SharePoint  for  review  and  approval prior  to  publication.  Include  AFMC/A3V  and  AFMC/A3O  on  the  distribution  list  for approved supplements. 1.3.  Changes.  Send recommended changes on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of  Publication,  to  AFMC/A3V  via  e-mail  to  the  AFMC/A3V  ORG.  AF/A3  is  the  approval authority for interim changes (IC) and revisions to this instruction. (T-2) AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 5 1.4.  Waivers.  Submit requests for waivers through appropriate training channels, field unit commanders  and  group  commanders  (i.e.  OG/CCs)  prior  to  submission  to  AFMC/A3V. AFMC/A3V will forward waiver requests to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority. Use an AFMC Form 73, AFMC Waiver and Approval Request, to process the waiver. 1.5.  Roles and Responsibilities. 1.5.1.  Flying unit commanders and supervisors at all levels must monitor the progress of crewmember  training  to  ensure  timely  progression  through  the  appropriate  training phases and to identify areas in which an aircrew member needs more training. (T-2) 1.5.2.  The squadron training office will: 1.5.2.1.  Develop and implement programs to carry out required aircrew training. 1.5.2.2.  Ensure compliance with training directives specified in paragraph 1.1. 1.5.2.3.  Ensure all Education Training Course Announcement (ETCA) formal course prerequisites  are  completed  before  requesting  formal  training  or  entering  a crewmember  into  any  phase  of  training.  Note:  Units  must  request  formal  training through AFMC/A3V. 1.5.2.4.  Track Phase I and II training progress (entry and training completion dates as a minimum) via a locally developed process. 1.5.2.5.  Maintain  aircrew  training  folders  by  electronic  means  using  MAJCOM approved  training  software  (i.e.  Center  Ops  Online  (COOL))  or,  if  no  such  means available,  by  using  paper  copies  for  all  assigned/attached  flyers.  As  a  minimum, conduct  end  of  half  reviews  of  active  training  folders  and  a  final  review  before  a training  folder  becomes  inactive.  See  Chapter  8  for  training  folder  administrative procedures. 1.5.2.5.1.  Maintain a tracking system that records the date of folder reviews. 1.5.2.6.  Maintain  an  Aircrew  Letter  of  Certification  (Letter  of  Xs)  by  electronic means using MAJCOM approved training software or, if no such means available, by using  paper  copies.  This  letter  documents  all  aircrew  mission  qualifications  and certifications. The Letter of Xs must be updated monthly and certified by the OG/CC, flying  squadron  commander,  or  operations  officer.  The  Letter  of  Xs  in  conjunction with the AFMC Form 68, Flight Training Record, signed at the conclusion of training serve to document each crewmembers mission certifications. 1.5.2.6.1.  If  a  training  program  only  requires  an  AFMC  Form  67,  Ground Training Record (e.g.  Evaluator Training), document the certification on the AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Aircrew Training. 1.5.2.6.2.  Update  the  Letter  of  Xs  at  the  end  of each  semi-annual  training  cycle (30  September  and  31  March)  and  ensure  it  is  made  available  upon  request  to AFMC/A3V (posting of the Letter of Xs in COOL satisfies this requirement). 1.6.  Training Guidelines. 1.6.1.  Requirements established in this instruction may be more restrictive than AFI 11-202 Vol 1, Aircrew Training and the associated AFMC Sup. If so, the requirement in this 6 AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 instruction takes precedence. Requirements established in attachments to this instruction take precedence over requirements/restrictions in the basic portion of this instruction. 1.6.2.

Special  Aircraft  Training  Requirements.  Units  will  develop  training  plans  and establish  crewmember those  aircraft  designated  as developmental,  experimental,  pre-production  or  prototype.  Submit  proposed  plans  to AFMC/A3V  for  approval.  If  the  unit  determines  adequate  crewmember  flight  currency and  proficiency  cannot  be  solely  maintained  in  the  test  aircraft,  then  crewmembers  will maintain  currency  and  proficiency  in  an  AFMC  operational  aircraft.  The  AFMC operational aircraft must be similar, in flight characteristics and handling qualities, to the specific test aircraft. If so designated by the unit, flying proficiency events accomplished in the test aircraft may be credited toward total training requirements. 1.6.4.1.  With  prior  AFMC/A3V  approval  (staffed  on  an  AFMC  Form  73),  OG/CCs may request civilian FAA training IAW the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 61. This training is intended for a crewmember to earn a type certificate awarded by an  FAA  check  airman  following  a  flight  evaluation.  As  part  of  an  approved  test program and on a case by case basis, the pilots may receive the extra training to earn an Airline Transport Pilot rating to allow a qualification in either pilot’s seat/position. 1.6.4.1.1.  Aircrews  will  maintain  currency  and  proficiency  IAW  Chapter  4  of this  AFI,  its  attachments,  approved  unit  supplements  and  existing  waivers.

A  qualified  helicopter  instructor pilot must be in command and be in a seat with a set of flight controls. 2.7.1.7.  The AFTC/CC is the approval authority for AFTC crewmembers O-6/GS-15 and  above.  AFMC/A3  is  the  approval  authority  for  non-AFTC  O-6/GS-15 crewmembers and above. These  authorities cannot  be further delegated nor are they to be confused with AFI 11-401 Orientation Flight approval authorities. 2.7.2.  Limited  Qualification  Status.  Limited  qualification  status is  for  primary crewmembers  that  cannot  meet  the  training  requirements  of  this  instruction  and  MD-specific  attachments  because  of  mission  requirements  or  aircraft  limitations.  The following rules apply to this qualification status: AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 13 2.7.2.1.  Use of this status is restricted to crewmembers in particular test programs, to crewmembers  in  units  without  assigned  aircraft,  to  multiple  qualified  pilots  (who must  maintain  full  qualification  in  their  primary  aircraft)  and  to  USAF  TPS instructors.  OG/CCs  must  ensure  sufficient  capability  is  retained  to  fly  unit  aircraft during  contingencies  or  unusual  circumstances.  Do  not  use  this  status  to  solve problems  caused  by  a  temporary  shortage  of  aircraft  or  flying  hours.  Personnel  in limited  qualification  status  must  take  care  to  perform  in-flight  duties  only  under conditions for which they are trained and current (e.g. day only, VMC only). 2.7.2.2.  Personnel  in  this  status  will  fly  the  aircraft  on  the  assigned  mission  only. Only mission essential personnel are authorized on the aircraft. 2.7.2.3.  All  training  is  conducted  IAW  this  instruction  and  the  applicable  MD-specific attachments with the following exception: 2.7.2.3.1.  Limited  qualification  may  be  acquired  by  completing  training  in  the areas aircrew will exercise in the accomplishment of the mission. For example, a pilot who has a limited qualification in the F-16 and is restricted to non-formation, day  and  VMC  would  only  need  the  familiarization  sorties  during  initial qualification training. Continuation training and currency would consist of sorties and landings only. 2.7.2.4.  Full  qualification  may  be  acquired  by  completing  all training requirements of this instruction and applicable MD-specific attachments. Do not use limited  qualification  as  an  intermediate  qualification  level  leading  to  initial qualification. the 2.8.  Pilot Training.  MAJCOM directed Phase I training plans are found on COOL. 2.8.1.  For  the  purpose  of  this  instruction,  the  term  “single-pilot  aircraft”  means  aircraft that require a minimum crew of only one pilot as defined in the aircraft’s flight manual (regardless of whether a second seat exists in the aircraft). For example, both F-15 and F-16 aircraft are “single-pilot aircraft.” 2.8.2.  Single-pilot  aircraft  ground  training  requirements.  Pilots  will  complete  closed book  written  qualification  and  critical  action  procedures/boldface  examinations  before the first flight  IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2.

Upon  AFMC/A3V approval  (IAW  AFI  11-202  Vol  1),  document  this  training  in  unit  supplements.  Simulator requirements,  based  on  availability  and  applicability,  are  included  in  the  unit  developed programs.  Use  AFMC  Forms  67/68/69  to  document  simulator  training.  When  structuring programs, flying units will ensure that mission operational and training areas are compatible. Upon completion of appropriate coordination, flying unit commanders or operations officers must enter crew members into training, reference paragraph 8.5.2.6. 3.1.1.  All  AFMC-specified  Phase  II  training  plans  are  found  on  COOL.  The  forms posted  are  the  only  ones  authorized  to  execute  Command  Specified  Phase  II  mission qualification  training.  To  ensure  use  of  the  most  current  training  syllabus,  the  training office must download the current training form just prior to starting each Phase II mission qualification.  Exception:  Unit  specific  Phase  II  training  forms  may  be  referenced  on COOL and maintained locally after approval by AFMC/A3V. 3.1.2.  If an individual remains non-current in a Phase II event for a period exceeding six months,  qualification  in  that  event  is  lost.  Duration  of  the  unqualified  time  is  from  the date  the  aircrew  member  became  unqualified  until  the  date  of  the  first  event  in  the retraining syllabus is completed. 3.1.2.1.  Unqualified  up  to  2  years:  Complete  requalification  training.  Use  the requalification  training  column  on  the  AFMC  Form  68  training  plan(s).

Unit  commanders  may  authorize  aerial  photographers  to  perform  airborne photographic  duties  in  support  of  unit  missions  IAW  AFI  35-109,  Visual  Information. This section outlines the minimum training required for military personnel, Government Service  personnel  and  contractors  to  perform  airborne  photographic  duties  aboard ejection  seat  (rear  cockpit)  and  non-ejection  seat  aircraft.  Aerial  photographers  are typically  classified  as  Non  Rated  Aircrew  (NRA)  IAW  AFI  11-401,  Aviation Management. 3.7.2.  Prerequisites: NRA Phase  I training culminating with  a qualification certification on an AF Form 8a is a prerequisite to Aerial Photographer training and qualification for each  MD.  Note:  Combat  Camera  personnel  are  classified  as  operational  support  flyers only  and  are  not  considered  Non-rated  Aircrew  and/or  Aerial  Photographers  until respective training and qualification certification is complete. 3.7.3.  Training Classification. There are two categories of Phase II training; ejection and non-ejection seat. 3.7.4.  Training Requirements. 3.7.4.1.  Ground  Training  Requirements.  The  most  appropriate  instructor  aircrew qualified  in  the  respective  aircraft  will  conduct  this  ground  training.  If  a representative aircraft is unavailable a cockpit trainer may be substituted. Trainee will wear all applicable flight gear and have a representative camera system for use in this training.  In  addition  to  training  specified  by  MD-specific  attachments,  aerial photographer training will include, as a minimum, the following: 3.7.4.1.1.  Cockpit familiarization. This familiarization will include: 3.7.4.1.1.1.  Demonstration of equipment stowage 3.7.4.1.1.2.  Discussion of any restrictions associated with aerial photography in the applicable aircraft (e.g. limited space in a fighter cockpit) 3.7.4.1.2.  Emergency procedures. Emergency procedures training will include (if applicable): 3.7.4.1.2.1.  Ground egress 3.7.4.1.2.2.  Bailout and ejection procedures with equipment in cockpit 3.7.4.1.2.3.  BOLD FACE/CAPS 3.7.4.1.3.  Normal  Procedures.  Normal  procedures  training  should  include  chase positioning and crew coordination terminology (e.g. up-down-forward-aft-in-out). Crew duties take priority over photographer duties. Include photographer specific training to include the importance of sun angles, canopy reflections and problems associated with a zoom lens. 3.7.4.1.4.  Mission requirements associated with photo chase sortie (e.g. weapons 34 AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 separation, CFP, Loads and Flutter, Public Relations support). Review past chase mission footage and proof sheets with trainee. Make sure trainee fully understands the indispensable data they are responsible for on photo chase missions. Cover the requirements of a "photo desired" versus a "photo required" mission. 3.7.4.1.5.  Equipment training will include practicing photography shooting skills on ground with each camera to ensure thorough familiarization prior to first flight with a camera. 3.7.4.1.6.  Document  completion  of  ground  training  on  the  applicable  portion  of the Aerial Photographer Qualification ground training syllabus. 3.7.4.2.  Flying  Training  Requirements.  Aerial  photography  flight  training  qualifies the  photographer  to  carry  cameras  and  associated  equipment.  Only  cameras  and associated  gear  that  have  been  approved  IAW  AFI  11-202  Vol  3  may  be  used  on board aircraft. Flying training is required only for ejection seat aircraft. This training should simulate a typical profile the crewmember will be required to fly. It is flown as a  dedicated  two-ship  under  day  VMC  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.  A Photo/Safety  Chase  qualified  instructor  pilot  will  conduct  all  flying  training. Document  training  on  the  Aerial  Photographer  Qualification  flight  training  grade-sheet. instructor  aircrew  signature  on 3.7.4.2.1.  The the  Aerial  Photographer Qualification Ground Training Syllabus signifies that the chief photographer has approved  the  individual  to  begin  flying  training.  A  minimum  of  one  flight  is required  prior  to  beginning  initial  Aerial  Photographer  qualification  training. Additionally, Aerial  Photographers not  previously  qualified on  either an  F-15 or F-16  are  required  a  minimum  of  one  flight  prior  to  F-15  or  F-16  Aerial Photographer Phase II training.  This flight is strictly a familiarization flight with no  camera  system.  Use  the  Non-Rated  Aircrew  Training  Plan  to  train  to  and document this familiarization flight. Otherwise, ground training only is authorized for subsequent Phase II Aerial Photographer training in another MD. 3.7.4.2.2.  Due to limited space and safety considerations, do not take more than two camera systems in fighter/trainer aircraft without prior approval from the unit commander. In addition, photographers may not carry more than one camera until the photographer is familiar and comfortable operating in the flying environment. Document  this  on  the  Aerial  Photographer  Qualification  flight  training  grade sheet and associated AFMC Form 69. Annotate any restrictions on the applicable qualification roster (Letter of Xs). 3.7.4.2.3.  Flying training should begin using simplest camera system and include a  representative  sample  of  missions  requiring  photographic  support.  Ensure  that crews  perform inter-cockpit  communication,  radio  calls  and  equipment management as would be completed during an actual test mission. Ensure mission data is reviewed after each mission and give the trainee feedback. 3.7.4.2.4.  Once competency is demonstrated during an airborne training mission the  aerial  photographer  is  cleared  for  "photo  desired"  missions  only.  Training officers will clear the aerial photographer for “photo required” missions based on AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 35 proficiency,  experience  and  instructor  pilot/chief  photographer  concurrence. Document this on the flight training grade sheet and associated AFMC Form 69. Annotate any restrictions on the applicable qualification roster (Letter of Xs). 4.

RPA crews only performing MCE duties do not need to be current on LR currencies, but a current/qualified LR crewmember must be on call. 1. Only applies to Launch and Recovery Qualified RPA crewmembers. 2. An AFMC approved simulator (with motion active) may be used to extend currency as long as the individual is not overdue that event. Unless further defined in MDS attachments, there is no restriction for how many times the simulator is used to extend that currency provided the individual does not ever go overdue. If an individual is non-current (i.e. overdue), currency is regained per standard AFI 11-2FT Vol 1 processes. 3. Simulator credit for C & E-Design aircraft only. 4. Maintaining a cadre of night qualified aircrew members is at the discretion of the OG/CC.   If a night qualification is maintained, the night currency requirements in Table 6 apply. The night qualification is maintained on the letter of Xs. Annotate a lack of a night qualification on the AF Form 8 as a “Day Only” restriction, even if the restriction is expected to be lifted at a later date. Pilots may credit a night landing for currency for landings accomplished at night as defined in AFI 11-202 Vol 3. 5. Exception: RPA crewmembers. 6. Applies to each MD that performs airborne simulated engine out patterns as outlined in MD attachments. Simulator credit is allowed for multi-engine aircraft only (see Note 2).

Simulator credit is allowed for C-Design aircraft only (see Note 2). 9. Simulator must have terrain visual presentation. 10. Simulator conditions must be night and/or IMC. 11. For operational support crewmembers, currency requirements do not mandate flying or approved man-months. Man-months of approved hazardous duty pay must be pre-approved. attachment 4.4.2.3.  Conversion/Difference  Requirements.  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the applicable  MD-specific supplements, conversion/difference  training  is  current  as  long  as  qualification  is  held  for  the mission/design  aircraft  in  which  training  was  accomplished.  Conversion/difference training must be re-accomplished when crewmembers become unqualified as per AFI 11-202  Vol  1.  Training  events  accomplished  during  conversion/difference  training can be credited toward basic currency/proficiency flying requirements. or associated unit 4.4.3.  Proficiency. Table 7 lists the AFMC proficiency requirements to be accomplished semi-annually (1 Oct- 31 Mar and 1 Apr-30 Sep) by crew position. Events accomplished during Phase I initial qualification or requalification training are not credited toward these 44 AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 requirements except those accomplished on a successful AF Form 8 evaluation. Training events  accomplished  during  conversion/difference  training  can  be  credited  toward  basic proficiency  flying  requirements.  After  successful  completion  of  Phase  I  qualification, training  events  accomplished  during  Phase  II  training  may  be  credited  toward  Phase  1 currency  and  proficiency  requirements.  Flying  units  will  establish  procedures  so commanders  and  supervisors  can  monitor  crewmember  progress  toward  accomplishing an  approximately  proportionate  share  of  proficiency  requirements.  Proficiency requirements,  to  the  maximum  extent  possible,  should  be  accomplished  uniformly throughout the semi-annual training period. 4.4.3.1.  Each  proficiency  requirement  only  applies  to  aircrews  that  are  qualified  in the  event.  The  OG/CC  or  unit  commander  has  the  authority  to  determine  which aircrews  are  qualified  in  the  listed  events.  Additional  proficiency  requirements  may be specified in MD attachments and/or unit supplements to this instruction. 4.4.3.2.  At the conclusion of each semi-annual training period the training office will provide the commander a list (in the form of an End of Half (EOH) report) of those personnel that did not meet proficiency requirements.

Pilots,  Flight  Engineers,  Special  Mission Aviators  and  Navigators  (if  the  simulator  has  a  navigator  position)  must  attend  aircraft simulator refresher training at least once every 12 months. For annual simulator refresher training,  an  AFMC  approved  simulator  is  one  that,  as  a  minimum,  can  simulate instrument and emergency instrument patterns at an instructor’s direction. 4.6.1.1.  If  there  is  no  simulator  support,  formal  or  contractor  supported,  for  a particular  MDS  aircraft,  simulator  training  is  not  required.  If  a  crewmember  is qualified  in  several  series  of  the  same  mission  design  aircraft,  simulator  training  is required in only one series. 4.6.1.2.  If  the  OG/CC  considers  other  MAJCOM  lesson  plans  inappropriate  for Annual  Simulator  Refresher  Training,  AFMC  flying  units  will  develop  simulator lesson  plans  that  complement  their  local  missions.  In  constructing  simulator  lesson plans, emphasis should be placed on aircraft systems, emergency procedures training and cockpit/crew resource management. 4.6.1.3.  Failure  to  complete  required  simulator  refresher  training  in  the  prescribed period  is  not  grounding.  Notify  the  OG/CC  in  writing,  through  appropriate  training channels,  with  specific  details  including  when  simulator  refresher  training  went overdue, the projected completion date and when overdue training is complete. (T-3) 4.6.2.  Proficiency  Events  Logged  in  Simulator.  In  order  to  log  any  currency  or proficiency events from Table 6 or Table 7 in a simulator, an AFMC approved simulator must  be  used.  The  most  current  list  of  AFMC  approved  simulators  is  located  on  the AFMC/A3V SharePoint. Event currency may only be updated in  a simulator for certain specified events listed in Table 6. For B-757 operations, AFMC allows the use of a “D-level”  simulator  to  update  all  currency  and  proficiency  events  (up  to  50%  of  the semiannual  proficiency  requirements).  See  MD  attachments  for  additional  simulator currency and proficiency requirements. 4.6.3.  Systems  Refresher  Training.  Flying  units  will  develop  a  training  program  that ensures  crewmembers  maintain  familiarity  with  aircraft  systems.  As  a  minimum,  this training will include: 4.6.3.1.  Aircraft systems, subsystems and components 4.6.3.2.  Critical and non-critical emergency procedures. 54 AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 4.6.3.3.  A minimum of three training sessions per semiannual training period. Note: Annual  simulator  refresher  training  may  be  credited  as  one  event  toward  this requirement. 4.6.3.4.  RPA  Launch  and  Recovery  Qualified  crews  will  also  review  proper takeoff/landing  techniques  and  procedures.  Review  will  include  crosswind  landing, go-around,  hard  landings,  bounce  and  PIO  recovery.  Training  will  include  video review of good and bad techniques. 4.7.  Proration  of  Training.  When  determining  training  requirements,  prorate  an  aircrew member  not  available  for  flying  duties  IAW  AFI  11-202  Vol  1  and  this  paragraph.  The following guidance applies: 4.7.1.  All aircrew must complete a proportionate share of training requirements outlined in Table 7 starting with the first day of the month after the qualification flight evaluation. 4.7.2.  Crewmembers are not considered available for training if they are absent for more than  15  consecutive  days  because  of  one  of  the  following  or  a  combination  of  the following:  PCS  move,  non-flying  TDY,  duty  not  involving  flying  (DNIF),  Phase  1 training, or emergency leave. 4.7.3.  Flying  units  may  reduce  requirements  when  the  cumulative  total  of  periods  that exceed 15 consecutive days of non-availability results in changing the months available according to Table 8: Table 8.

Emergency Procedures (to include ground, inflight, egress and ejection). 4.15.  Multiple Qualification Requirements. 4.15.1.  See AFI 11-202 Vol 2 AFMC Sup for AFMC multiple qualification policy. 4.15.2.  Currency  Requirements.  Perform  Table  6  requirements  in  each  aircraft  the crewmember is qualified. The following exceptions apply: 4.15.2.1.  Mission  Requirements.  Maintain  mission  currency  in  each  aircraft  for which  currency  is  maintained  unless  specified  in  this  instruction.  Units  may  invoke the 50 percent rule outlined in  paragraph 4.15.3 to accomplish mission proficiency requirements. 4.15.2.2.  The 45 day pilot instrument approach may be performed in any aircraft the pilot is qualified, and if accomplished in a manned aircraft, they may update currency in  all  manned  and  unmanned  aircraft.  However  if  the  instrument  approach  is accomplished  in  an  unmanned  aircraft,  currency  may  only  be  updated  in  other unmanned aircraft. 56 AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 4.15.3.  Proficiency  Requirements.  At  least  50  percent  of  the  proficiency  flying requirements  in  Table  7  must  be  performed  in  each  aircraft  in  which  an  individual  is qualified. However, the total basic proficiency flying event requirements must not be less than  aircraft  qualification  requiring  the  most  sorties.  The  total  basic  proficiency  flying event requirements must be at least equal to the highest requirement of all the aircraft in which the aircrew is qualified. For example, if API-1 qualified in a bomber and a fighter (15 and 45 sortie requirement), then a total sortie requirement of 45 exists. 4.16.  G-Awareness Assessment (Fighter/Trainer).  Flying units will develop a program to ensure  in-flight  AGSM  is  reviewed  for  BFM  and/or  ACBT  qualified  aircrew  at  least  once every  12  months  by  the  squadron  Flight  Surgeon,  Aerospace  Physiologist,  or  squadron supervisor  (SQ/CC,  SQ/DO,  SQ/ADO,  Flt/CC).  Emphasis  will  also  be  placed  on  briefing, debriefing and assessing the proper AGSM during flight debriefs. The assessment should be done as a normal part of video review after every flight. 4.16.1.  Identify  aircrew  having  poor  AGSM  technique  or  low  G-tolerance  to  the appropriate  SQ  supervisor.  SQ  supervision  will  determine  what  action  is  required  to improve  the  aircrew's  G-tolerance.  The  SQ/CC  will  determine  if  Commander-Directed Acceleration Training is required IAW AFI 11-404. 5.  UPGRADE QUALIFICATION TRAINING. 5.1.  General.  In  addition  to  the  training  guidance  outlined  in  AFI  11-202  Vol  1,  AFMC Sup,  use  this  instruction,  including  MD-specific  attachments,  when  completing  upgrade qualification training in AFMC. 5.2.  Copilot  to  First  Pilot  (Aircraft  Commander)  Upgrade.  Table  9  outlines  first  pilot flying hour requirements for specified aircraft. The prerequisite flying time experience levels required  for  upgrade  are  based  on  the  copilot  having  gained  the  knowledge  and  judgment required  to  effectively  accomplish  the  unit's  mission.  This  training  is  accomplished  via  a formal  course  or  in-unit  unless  otherwise  directed  by  MD-specific  attachments.  Use  formal courseware for in-unit upgrade training. Table 9.

When  accepting  instructor  qualification  from  another  MAJCOM,  the Instructor Upgrade Ground Training lesson plan must be accomplished to familiarize the crewmember with AFMC policy, instructions and regulations. The lesson plan is completed  prior  to  instructor  qualification  and  documented  in  the  crewmember's training folder. Upon completion of AFMC instructor training an individual is a basic instructor and will not instruct Phase II missions until qualified. 5.3.3.  Flying  Training.  Conduct  instructor  upgrade  training  in  the  crew  position  from which  instruction  will  normally  be  performed.  Instructor  lessons  will  consist  of AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 59 demonstrations  and  practice  of  procedures  and  techniques  used  in  accomplishing instructor duties. In addition to accomplishing the individual items on the instructor grade sheet during the course of the upgrade, the upgrading instructor will brief/instruct/debrief elements of the unit’s primary mission. Evaluate one or more of these mission elements during the instructor evaluation. 5.3.4.  Instructor Qualification. An instructor candidate will receive an instructor upgrade flight  evaluation  according  to  AFI  11-202  Vol  2  AFMC  Sup.  The  instructor  flight evaluation  may  be  accomplished  prior  to  completion  of  night  training  events,  but  the individual will not perform instructor duties at night until completion of these events. 5.3.5.  Instructor  Requalification.  When  an  instructor  loses  aircraft  qualification  for  2 years  or  less,  the  flying  unit  commander  will  determine  what  instructor  requalification training  is  required.  When  concurrent  instructor/requalification  is  accomplished,  the limitation of not conducting Pilot Phase II training during Pilot Phase I training is not in effect.  When  an  instructor  loses  aircraft  qualification  for  greater  than  two  years,  the instructor  training  syllabus,  as  established  in  the  AFI  11-2FT  Vol  1  MD-specific attachment,  must  be  accomplished. instructor requalification evaluation including all instructor evaluation requirements. In  either  case,  accomplish  an 5.3.5.1.  When completing concurrent requalification and instructor training, place the Forms 67, 68 and 69 in Section 1 of the training folder. The requalification quantity of  events  required  by  the  syllabus  takes  precedence  over  the  quantity  of  required Instructor  events.  When  proficient  as  an  instructor  in  a  training  event,  annotate  the number in the events accomplished column(s). 5.3.6.  Mission  Instructor.  An  instructor  qualified  in  the  aircraft,  crew  position  and mission  will  conduct  mission  training,  unless  otherwise  directed  by  MD-specific attachments.  Instructors  and  flight  examiners  completing  mission  training  may  be designated/considered  mission  instructors  upon  completion  of  mission  training  unless restricted by MD-specific attachments. 5.3.6.1.  Upon  qualification  as  an  instructor,  aircrew  members  are  considered instructor qualified in all mission types in which they are currently qualified unless a specific  instructor  training  plan  exists  for  a  specific  mission  (e.g.  ACBT  instructors must specifically accomplish ACBT instructor requalification training). 5.4.  Flight Examiner Certification.  Squadron commanders will select and designate flight examiners as prescribed in AFI 11-202 Vol 2, AFMC Sup. Flight Examiner Upgrade Ground Training  is  accomplished  by  the  upgrade  candidate  with  a  flight  examiner  qualified crewmember prior to designation as a flight examiner. When accepting flight examiner status from another MAJCOM, the Flight Examiner Upgrade Ground Training lesson plan must be accomplished  to  familiarize  the  aircrew  member  with  AFMC  policy,  instructions  and regulations. Accomplish the lesson plan prior to accomplishing examiner duties and filed in Section 3 of the crewmember's training folder. 6.  TRAINING  RESTRICTIONS.  Training  restrictions  are  incorporated  throughout  this volume and attachments. AFMC operating procedures and restrictions are located in AFI 11-2FT Vol 3. 60 AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 7.  ADDITIONAL  TRAINING.  MD-specific  attachments  will  specify  any  additional  training not considered aircraft, mission, upgrade, or continuation training. 8.  COMMAND TRAINING PLANS PRESCRIBED.  AFMC flying units will use the AFMC prescribed  training  forms  and  the  overprints  on  COOL  as  directed  in  this  instruction.  Training plans tailored to specific aircraft, crew position and/or mission are contained in the MD-specific attachments of this instruction. 8.1.  The  training  folder  is  used  to  organize  and  track  training.  It  also  serves  to  document completed  training.  Training  folders  will  thoroughly  document  how  aircrew  received qualifications  through  acceptance  of  qualification  process,  formal  course  documentation  or completed training plans. Units will maintain training folders electronically using COOL, if possible.  Otherwise,  they  are  authorized  to  maintain  training  folders  manually  (in  paper format).  Electronic  signatures  on  training  forms  are  authorized.  Construct  and  maintain folders IAW paragraph 8.5. 8.2.  Training  folders  are  required  to  document  training  for  all  crewmembers  performing inflight duties aboard aircraft. For multi-qualified aircrew (rated, career enlisted aviators and non-rated  aircrew  (NRA),  flight  surgeons  and  operational  support  aircrew)  training  folders may  contain  multiple  aircraft  training  documentation.  If  hardcopy  training  folders  are maintained instead of using COOL, comply with paragraph 8.5 requirements. 8.3.  Access to electronic training folders is restricted via a password or other means. Active training  folders  are  readily  accessible  to  instructors  and  trainers,  supervisory  personnel  and the individual crewmembers in training. Instructors and trainees will review training folders for  each  specific  training  session.  Upon  completion  of  the  session,  the  appropriate  training folder documentation must be promptly completed. 8.4.  Unit training managers may file completed training folders in an inactive status as long as an individual is assigned to the unit. If the individual changes units, the training office will ensure the training folder is  forwarded to the  gaining unit.  If  an individual  separates/retires from the USAF or is assigned to a non-flying position, the unit will give the training folder to the individual. 8.5.  Organize training folders as follows: 8.5.1.  Title the training folder with the trainee's name, grade, aircraft and crew position. 8.5.2.  Divide the folder into six separate sections as described below. Use training plans as  documentation  in  these  sections.  File  completed  training  plans  as  a  set  (applicable AFMC Forms 67, 68 and 69) with the most recent set on top. The set should be ordered with the AFMC Form 67 on top, the AFMC Form 68 in the middle and the AFMC Forms 69 last. 8.5.2.1.  Summary  -  Maintain  a  current  AFMC  Form  1381(on  the  inside  cover  if  in paper form). Multiple qualified aircrew members must have an AFMC Form 1381 in both training folders. Annotate all completed Phase I and Phase II training completion items. Also annotate acceptance of non-AFMC qualification(s), AFMC qualifications and other than MDS qualifications, IAW paragraph 1.6.4 8.5.2.2.  Section  One  (Phase  1-Basic  Aircraft  Qualification)  -  Contains  ground  and flying  training  documentation  for  Phase  I  training  including:  initial  qualification, AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 61 requalification,  conversion  and  difference  training  (to  include  documentation provided through formal course instruction). 8.5.2.3.  Section  Two  (Phase  2-Mission  Qualification)  -  Contains  ground  and  flying training  documentation  for  Phase  II  mission  qualification  or  mission  requalification training. When conducting multiple, simultaneous qualifications the instructor is only required  to  complete  one  AFMC  Form  69.  Place  a  photocopy  of  the  Form  69  with each  ongoing  qualification.  Alternatively,  a  blank  AFMC  Form  69  may  be  placed with each qualification that references the “primary” Form 69. 8.5.2.4.  Section Three (AC/IP/EP qualification) - Contains ground and flying training upgrade  documentation  for  copilot  to  first  pilot  (aircraft  commander),  instructor (phase 1 and phase 2) and flight examiner upgrade training. 8.5.2.5.  Section Four (Other) - Contains training plans not considered part of sections 1, 2 or 3. to entry into include 8.5.2.6.  Section  Five  (Training/MFR  Documentation)  -  Contains  all  training correspondence commander approvals/authorization, waiver approvals, email coordination, acceptance of aircraft, mission  and/or  upgrade  qualifications  and  memorandums  for  record.  Memos  for Record  (MFRs)  and  associated  attachments  may  be  kept  in  the  specific  Sections  of the training folder to which they apply in order to clarify and document qualifications. training letters, 8.5.2.6.1.  Entry  into  Training.  Prior  to  beginning  each  phase  I  or  phase  II qualification, the flying unit commander or operations officer must authorize the training. The training may be authorized on the Letter of Xs or with an Entry into Training  letter  maintained  in  Section  5  of  the  training  folder.  In  either  case  the training office must track training start and completion due dates. 8.6.  Training Plans: 8.6.1.  AFMC/A3V specified training plans used to document all AFMC aircrew training are  provided  in  electronic  format  on  COOL.  AFMC  Forms  67,  68  and  69  are  the  only authorized  training  plans.  If  the  training  plan  for  a  unique  mission  is  not  specified  by AFMC/A3V,  units  may  develop  a  unique  training  plan  for  AFMC/A3V  approval.  Unit supplements should include appropriate continuation training requirements for the unique qualification.  Units  will  maintain  electronic  training  plans  using  COOL,  if  possible.  If unable  to  use  COOL,  coordinate  AFMC/A3V  approval  of  an  alternative  method  via  an AFMC Form 73. 8.6.2.  Training Plan Usage. To ensure the most current syllabus is used, training officers should only download the forms when phase I or phase II training is initiated as training forms  frequently  change  and  previous  editions  of  training  forms  are  obsolete.  Training plans  are  identified  by  name,  approval  date  and  version  number  level,  aircraft,  phase, aircrew position and version number. 8.6.3.  Training  Plan  Update  Cycle.  Phase  I  training  forms  are  updated  in  April  of  each year. Phase II training forms are updated in September of each year. 62 AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 8.6.3.1.  Mid-cycle update of a training plan. Occasionally training forms are updated in-between annual reviews/updates. If that is the case, the updated form is annotated with the date of the change at the bottom the form. 8.6.4.  The  AFMC  Form  67  is  used  to  record  all  ground  training  required  before  the trainee's  first  flight.  This  form  provides  for  the  overprint  of  required  ground  training tasks. Document any additional ground training (simulators, cockpit procedural trainers, etc.)  accomplished  during  the  flying  training  phase  on  the  AFMC  Form  68.

This  form  provides for the  overprint  of  required  training  tasks  and  end-of-course  proficiency  levels  for  each ground/flying  training  task.  It  also  records  the  number  of  events  accomplished  and proficiency  level  attained  by  the  trainee.  AFMC  Form  68  lesson  plans  establish  the minimum  required  training  events  to  be  completed  for  initial  qualification  (QUAL), requalification  (REQUAL)  and  instructor  upgrade  (INST).  The  AFMC  Form  68  is  the official  certifying  document  for  each  Phase  II  qualification.  Table  12  provides  detailed instructions for completing the AFMC Form 68. AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 63 8.6.5.1.  Grading and grade definitions. Each AFMC syllabus training event must be graded.  Unless  noted  otherwise  (with  a  “D”  in  the  events  required  column)  all training events on the AFMC Form 68 must be accomplished until Proficiency, “P”, is  achieved.  The  AFMC  Form  68  indicates  the  required  events  and  grades  for  each training event. A grade of “P”, Proficient, “T”, Training Required, or “D”, Discussed is given at the instructor’s discretion using the following definitions: 8.6.5.1.1.  (P)  Proficient.  The  student  demonstrated  the  knowledge  and  skill necessary to successfully complete the event without instructor intervention and, in  the  instructor’s  opinion,  will  be  able  to  repeat  the  event  successfully  in  the future. 8.6.5.1.2.  (T)  Training required. The student did not demonstrate the knowledge and skill necessary to successfully complete the event. The student must continue training in that event until a grade of “P” is achieved. 8.6.5.1.3.  (D)  Discussed. The event requires instructor discussion only. A “P” or “T” grade is not assigned. Not every event may be satisfied with a “D”. Table 12.  Instructions for Completing AFMC Form 68, Flying Training Record. Item   Description  Entry  1  2  3  4  Name/Rank  Self-explanatory.

Proficiency Advancement. If the student demonstrates proficiency in at least 50  percent  of  the  minimum  required  events,  the  instructor,  with  training  officer concurrence,  may  proficiency  advance  that  item.  For  example:  if  the  minimum number  of  required  air  refueling  contacts  was  4  and  the  student  is  proficient  for  at least two contacts, then the instructor may recommend advancing that training item. Comments  on  the  associated  AFMC  Form  69  will  describe  which  items  were advanced. Training officer/NCO initials/ signature in  Block 9 serves  as concurrence for  proficiency  advancement.  If  training  is  complete,  the  number  of  required  sorties may  also  be reduced using these same  guidelines.  If the student reaches  proficiency and then regresses, proficiency must be regained before training is complete. 8.6.5.3.  Training  events  listed  may  be  completed  in  any  order.  The  instructor  is responsible  for  constructing  a  profile  for  each  training  flight  based  on  the  student's proficiency and the minimum number of events to be completed. 8.6.6.  The  AFMC  Form  69  is  used  to  document  flying  training.  This  form  is  used  in conjunction  with  AFMC  Form  68,  or  can  be  used  independently  to  document  training (e.g. re-currency training). It provides for narrative descriptions of the trainee's progress and a means for documenting the training office review. Maintain with AFMC Form 68 in  the  appropriate  section  of  the  training  folder.  A  separate  AFMC  Form  69  should accompany  each  type  of  flight  training  received  (i.e.  each  AFMC  Form  68).  The instructor will document any significant problems the student has in completing a training event  in  enough  detail  so  that  subsequent  instructors  can  provide  appropriate  training. Table 13 provides detailed instructions for completing the AFMC Form 69. Table 13.  Instructions for Completing AFMC Form 69, Flying Training Comments. Item   Description  Entry  1  2  Name/Rank  Self-explanatory.

Units may consider a preflight/ground abort a sortie if any training is accomplished (may not credit a sortie for currency or proficiency). Units may also use an abbreviation such as LAO 1, as long as the same designation is used on the AFMC Form 68.  Date of the specific sortie.  Mission, design and series of aircraft in which training was accomplished.  MISSION OVERVIEW: Describe the mission scenario, including mission profile and any events that impacted the mission (i.e. tanker MX cancel, weather, etc.).  STRENGTH: Comments should elaborate on trainee’s strengths and indicate student progress.  AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT: Describe the trainee’s weaknesses, identify problem areas and areas requiring student self-study and record unusual circumstances.  RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendations should include tasks requiring further training and the type of training required. Local overprints are authorized. If more space is needed, use the next blank section. Upon completion of all training requirements, a statement such as “Recommended for evaluation” or “All training requirements for weapons delivery completed” are appropriate. However, a statement such as “cleared for weapons delivery mission” is not appropriate as only OG/CC, squadron commander, or operations officer may certify an individual for a mission.  7  8  9  Instructor  Instructor will sign at completion of sortie.  Student/Date  Trainee will sign and date at completion of sortie.  Training Office Review/Date  The training officer/NCO, or individual in the trainee’s chain of command, will review the comments before the next training sortie. He or she should highlight any comments that are pertinent to follow-on training. Annotate this review by initials of training officer/NCO conducting review and date of review. When conditions preclude a timely review, the instructor will explain in remarks.  8.6.7.  The  AF  Form  1381  is  used  to  document  Phase  1  qualifications,  Phase  2 qualifications  and  other  than  MDS  qualifications  (SOF,  SUP,  ODO,  etc.).  It  may  be signed by the OG/CC, unit commander, or operations officer (electronic “signatures” are permitted).  Units  may  document  any  other  special  certifications  other  than  MDS qualifications  that  are  tracked  on  the  qualification  roster  (Letter  of  Xs).  For  multiple qualified  aircrew  members,  document  training  received  in  one  aircraft,  which  qualifies him/her in additional aircraft (i.e. LAO) by annotating the specific training being credited and the aircraft in  which the training was completed. The AF  Form 1381  is  filed in  the summary section of the training folder. AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 8.6.7.1.  AF Form 1381 Documentation. 8.6.7.1.1.  The  AF  Form  1381  may  be  maintained  electronically  and  updated  as qualifications are attained. 8.6.7.1.2.  For  Phase  I  training,  the  date  of  the  successful  Form  8  evaluation  is placed in the “Date Completed” block.

Direct  Instructor  Supervision—Supervision  by an instructor of like specialty with  immediate access to controls (for pilots, the instructor must occupy either the pilot or copilot seat). Drop Zone (DZ)—A specified area upon which airborne troops, equipment, or supplies are air-dropped. Due Regard—Operational situations that do not lend themselves to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) flight procedures, such as military contingencies, classified missions, politically sensitive missions, or training activities. Flight under “Due Regard” obligates the military aircraft commander to be his or her own air traffic control (ATC) agency and to separate his or her aircraft from all other air traffic. (See FLIP General Planning, Section 7) DZ  Entry  Point—A fixed point on DZ run-in course where an aircraft or formation or aircraft may safely begin descent from IFR enroute altitude to IFR drop altitude. The DZ entry point is a maximum  of  40  NM  prior  to  the  DZ  exit  point  according  to  Federal  Aviation  Administration FAR exemption 4371C. Formation descent will not begin until the last aircraft in formation is at or past the DZ entry point. DZ  Exit  Point—A fixed point on the DZ escape flight  path  centerline,  established during pre-mission planning, at which the formation will be at the minimum IFR enroute altitude. Calculate the exit point based upon three-engine performance at airdrop gross weight. This point is planned no less than four NM track distance beyond the DZ trailing edge. Earliest  Descent  Point  (EDP)—Earliest  point  in  the  DZ  run-in  course  where  the  lead  aircraft may  begin  IFR  descent  to  IFR  drop  altitude  and  be  assured  of  terrain  clearance  for  the  entire formation.

Minimum Fuel—Fuel state, where, upon reaching the destination, the aircraft can accept little or no  delay.  This  is  not  an  emergency  situation  but  merely  indicates  an  emergency  situation  is possible should any undue delay occur. Emergency  Fuel—Fuel  state  requires  immediate  traffic  priority  to  safely  recover  the  aircraft. Declare an emergency and immediately recover the aircraft at the nearest suitable field. Ground  Collision  Avoidance  System  (GCAS)—Automated  system  which  actively  or  semi-actively warns aircrew of impending ground collision.

No additional requirements. A2.7.  Additional Training.  No additional requirements.  AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 89 Attachment 3 B-1 TRAINING GUIDELINES A3.1.  General  Information.  This  attachment,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives, outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  B-1  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.  It  applies  to AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all B-1 aircraft. A3.1.1.  WSO requirements. The flying unit commander will determine the aft station crew complement  for  training  to  include  qualified  Weapon  Systems  Officers  (WSOs)  based  on flight  manual  and  unit  training  requirements.  “Non-traditional”  crew  procedures,  if applicable, must be developed by the unit and incorporated into the unit’s supplement upon approval from AFMC/A3V. A3.1.2.  IFAST  Simulator.  The  B-1  aft  station  trainer  located  in  the  Integrated  Avionics Software  Training  Facility  (IFAST)  at  Edwards  AFB,  CA  is  considered  an  approved simulator for completing B-1 WSO qualification/requalification simulator training events and flying events that specify “May be accomplished in the simulator.” The IFAST simulator is also  considered  an  approved  simulator  for  accomplishing  the  Electronics  Countermeasures additional  currency  requirement  for  WSOs  specified  in  Table  A3.3.  However,  it  is  not adequate for completing annual simulator training required by AFI 11-2FTV1 chapter 4. A3.2.  Phase I Training.  No additional requirements A3.3.  Phase II Training. A3.3.1.  The  nature  of  low  altitude  flight  in  the  B-1,  combined  with  the  AFMC  mission  to regularly test and evaluate terrain following systems below 500’ AGL, requires aircrew to be both Low Level Navigation and LASDT qualified. B-1 aircrew members conduct Low Level Navigation, TF and LASDT as a single training program. Pilots will demonstrate proficiency at  500’ AGL before accomplishing flight  maneuvers below 500’  AGL.  At the discretion of the instructor, this step down may occur on the same sortie.  While the majority of low level flight  is  conducted  using  the  TF  system,  aircrews  need  to  be  knowledgeable  of  aircraft handling  and  performance  characteristics  to  safely  conduct  operations  at  these  lower altitudes. A3.3.1.1.  Ground  Training.  The  following  outline  is  applicable  to  all  Low  Level Navigation/LASDT training. Training should incorporate appropriate portions of AFFTP 3-1 and AFTTP 3-3 Vol 20, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals—B-1. A3.3.1.1.1.  Aircraft Handling Qualities. Discuss aircraft performance as it applies to the  low  altitude  environment,  to  include:  control  response  (SEF,  Hinge  Moment Limiting, Speed Brake usage, Rudders), low/high speed, over-G potential, level turns, bank angles, aircraft buffet, climb/dive recoveries, effects of gross weight. A3.3.1.1.2.  Environmental  Factors.  Discuss  out-of-cockpit  visibility  and  Field  of View restrictions, sun angle, shadows/illusions (radar/visual). A3.3.1.1.3.  Low  Altitude  Awareness  Training.  Academics  should  consist  of  a discussion of low altitude tasks and task management/prioritization concepts and the importance of frequent cross check of aircraft attitude relative to the horizon. An Air Combat  Command  (ACC)  LAAT  refresher  course  satisfies  this  requirement.  Unless 90 AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 previously  LASDT  qualified,  pilots  and  WSOs  will  view  the  video  “How  Low  Can You Go?” A3.3.2.  Electronic  Countermeasures  (ECM)  Training.  ECM  training  is  used  to  qualify WSOs  to  a  level  of  proficiency  in  operating  B-1  defensive  system  equipment  to  include receive  and  transmit  functions  as  well  as  tail  warning,  towed  decoy  and  expendable countermeasure  functions.  ECM  training  is  used  to  train  and  WSOs  to  perform  ECM  in support of test programs requiring such operations. A B-1 instructor of like specialty, who is current and qualified in ECM, will administer the ground and flying training. A3.3.2.1.  NEAJAM,  EAJAM,  expendable  countermeasures,  tail  warning  function  and the  TDS  system  training  may  be  accomplished  in  the  simulator  or  IFAST.  The  TDS system training may also be accomplished in simulated or actual modes, as appropriate. A3.4.  Continuation Training. A3.4.1.

This  attachment  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives outlines  procedures  for  operation  of  the  C-130  aircraft  under  most  circumstances.  It  applies  to AFMC  aircrews  and  all  management  levels  concerned  with  operations  of  all  C-130  aircraft. Training  procedures  not  specifically  addressed  may  be  accomplished  if  they  enhance  safe, effective mission accomplishment. A10.1.1.  Aircraft Categories. For the purpose of C-130 qualification training, the following C-130 aircraft categories are defined: A10.1.1.1.  C-130J. C-130 aircraft series derived from the C-130J (i.e. MC-130J). A10.1.1.2.  C-130 H. All other C-130 aircraft series (i.e. C-130B through AC-130U). A10.1.2.  Aircrew Requirements and Qualifications. A10.1.2.1.  Navigator/CSO Requirements. The flying unit commander will determine the requirement  for  the  navigator  crew  complement,  to  include  Communication  System Officer (CSO) and Fire Control Officer (FCO), based on flight manual and unit training requirements.  Training  tables  and  lesson  plans  in  this  instruction  address  the  traditional navigator crew position. CSO and FCO procedures, if applicable, must be developed by the unit and incorporated into the unit's supplement. A10.1.2.2.  Loadmaster  and  Special  Mission  Aviator  (SMA)  Requirements.  The  flying unit commander will determine the need for loadmaster/SMA crew complement based on flight  manual  and  unit  training  requirements.  A  loadmaster  or  SMA,  as  appropriate  for the MDS, is required for all C-130J operations. A10.1.2.3.  Scanner Requirements. In general Scanners possess a 1Axxx AFSC, must be current  and  qualified  as  a  C-130  crewmember  and  have  completed  C-130  scanner training.  On  a  case  by  case  basis,  other  current/qualified  crewmembers  may  complete scanner training. Training is documented in the individual’s training folder and annotated on the AF Form 1381. C-130 Flight Engineers performing scanner duties do not require additional training. (N/A for C-130J) A10.1.2.4.  Instructor  Requirements.  Instructor  Flight  Engineers  may  complete  any aircraft systems for Qualification, Conversion, or Differences Ground Training. Instructor Flight Engineers may complete all phases of FCF Scanner Training. A10.2.  Phase I Training. A10.2.1.  Ground Training Requirements. Ground and flight training has been established for C-130 pilots, navigators, flight engineers, loadmasters and SMAs. With the exception of the open and closed book examinations (if required),  complete ground training prior to  starting Phase I flying training. A10.2.1.1.  Pilot and flight engineer local qualification training will follow ETCA formal course syllabi to the maximum extent possible. Emphasis should be placed on a thorough review  of  aircraft  systems/equipment,  cockpit  orientation  and  normal/emergency procedures.  All  systems  and  components  not  covered  in  training  due  to  differences 106 AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 between  the  simulator  and  the  C-130  being  trained  in,  must  be  covered  in  detail  by  an instructor during the aircraft visit. A10.2.1.2.  Simulator  Training.  Pilots  and  flight  engineers  will  accomplish  required simulator training prior to the initial qualification flight evaluation. A10.2.2.  Flying  Training  Requirements.  Initial  qualification  flying  training  must  be accomplished within the same C-130 category (i.e. C-130J or C-130H series). Copilots will accomplish  Phase  I  training  in  the  right  seat.  Required  left  seat  items,  such  as  engine  start, taxi, etc., may be demonstrated to the student. A10.2.3.  Qualification/Conversion/Difference Training. For pilots/flight engineers to qualify in another C-130 aircraft category (C-130J and C-130H) complete C-130J or H qualification training (however, a checkride is  not  required if the member holds a current  C-130 Form 8 for  that  crew  position  in  the  opposite  category).  C-130  conversion  training  is  required  for pilots/flight engineers to certify in another variant when flight training is required (reference Table  A10.1).  Difference training  (using a  representative  aircraft) is  required to  qualify in different  series  of  the  same  category  aircraft  when  ground  training  is  required  (reference Table A10.1). Instructors will focus training on systems, emergencies and operations limits differences  for  special  mission  equipment.  Open  and/or  closed  book  tests  are  not  required when completing  conversion/difference training  within the same C-130 category. Complete testing  for  the  first  entry  into  the  C-130J  category,  or  if  transitioning  from  the  C-130J category into the C-130H category. A10.2.3.1.  For  C-130J  pilots  only,  once  initial  qualification  is  complete  in  any  C-130J variant,  only  ground  difference  training  is  required  to  convert  to  other  variants. Exception:  A  flight  is  required  to  gain  qualification  in  the  CC-130J  (Stretch).  Training requirements are IAW AFMC/A3V syllabi. A10.2.3.2.  C-130J crewmembers must complete a conversion training plan (ground and flight) when transitioning between Block 6.1 and Block 7.0/8.1 or later. A10.2.3.3.  Establish and incorporate navigator conversion/difference training procedures into a unit supplement to this instruction. Conversion/Difference training may be grouped by  navigation  systems  and/or  radar  installation.  Exception:  Navigators  must  attend formal training to qualify in Combat Talon II. A10.2.3.4.  For C-130  Loadmasters, once initial qualification is complete in any C-130J or C130H category variant, only ground difference training is required to convert to other variants within that category. A10.2.3.5.  —SMAs must attend formal training to qualify in any AC-130 variant. A10.2.3.6.  Crewmembers requiring qualification training must comply with AFI 11-202 Vol 1 AFMC Sup guidance for Qualification/Requalification Training. A10.2.3.6.1.  Pilot/Loadmaster qualification/conversion training is allowed only if the individual has previously attended a C-130 initial qualification formal course. A10.2.3.6.2.  If  completing  a  local  qualification  to/from  the  C-130H/P/N/K/R/T/U and C-130J, use the appropriate COOL Phase I training plan. AFI11-2FTV1  28 FEBRUARY 2017 107 Table A10.1.

This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines procedures for operation of the C-146A/NC-146A aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to AFMC aircrews, as well as Contractor aircrews under GFR oversight. A12.1.1.  The  C-146A  is  the  militarized  version  of  the  Dornier  Do-328  aircraft.  The  NC-146A  is  the  Sensor  Test  Bed  operated  by  Big  Safari,  also  based  on  the  Do-328.  The  NC-146A  is  similar  to  current  block  upgraded  C-146  aircraft,  but  has  some  significant differences, including aircraft performance when configured with external pods. A12.2.  Phase I Training. A12.2.1.  Initial Pilot Qualification Training Requirements. Unqualified pilots will complete training through CAE or another commercial vendor.  The pilots will receive a Type Rating in the aircraft, along with an ATP rating if they complete the requirements before the FAA check ride.  The FAA will administer the check ride at the end of the course.  This evaluation will  count  for  the  Initial  Qualification  Evaluation  in  the  aircraft  and  is  annotated  on  an  Air Force  Form  8  for  both  civilian  and  military  pilots.    If  the  requirements  for  the  Instrument Evaluation are met (i.e. Instrument Exam), the simulator check can count for the Instrument Evaluation. A12.3.  Phase II Training. A12.3.1.  Phase II training events for the C-146/NC-146A are documented on current AFMC Training  Plans.  The  current  Phase  II  events  that  apply  are  FCF,  Special  Departure Procedures, Flight Test Orientation and Touch and Go training. Test programs occasionally require flying in other Phase II-type events, but AFMC pilots have no method to stay current in  them. When specific events  are required for testing (i.e. NVG, Assault  Zone Operations, Airdrop, etc.), document the crew training requirements in the Test Plan. A12.4.  Differences Training.  C-146 pilots must receive minimum of one NC-146A differences flight with a qualified instructor pilot IAW the AFMC Training Plan before operating as PIC. A12.5.  Continuation Training.  No additional requirements. A12.6.  Training Restrictions.  No additional requirements. A12.7.  Additional Training.
