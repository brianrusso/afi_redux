It also symbolizes the strength, dedication, and  devotion  to  duty  of  materiel  management  and  fuels  personnel  who  support  the  generation  and employment of aerospace forces across the spectrum of warfare.  In its talons, the falcon is holding a key and  a bolt of lightning. The bolt of lightning represents military strength and wartime readiness. The  key  symbolizes  the  security,  safekeeping,  and  control  of  supplies,  in  the  old  “Quartermaster Corps”  tradition. The  crossed  key  and  lightning  bolt  indicates  that  military  strength  and wartime readiness  can  only be  achieved through the support provided by professional materiel management personnel. The globe is symbolic of the extensive range of materiel management and fuels support which is worldwide. The  olive  branch  surrounding  the  badge  symbolizes  the  peace  aerospace  forces  provided  through professional materiel management corps. The three levels of award are signified by the addition of a star centered above the falcon for the senior level  and a start surrounded by an olive branch for the master level. Personnel can find specific guidance for the wear of the Materiel Management/Fuels badge in AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.  Enlisted materiel management personnel are awarded the basic badge after completing  initial 3-level training, the senior  badge after award of the 7-level, and the master badge as a Master Sergeant or above with 5 years in the specialty from award of the 7-level.   Table of Contents Part I .............................................................................................................................................................. 1 Preface .................................................................................................................................................... 1 Abbreviations/Terms Explained .............................................................................................................. 2 Section A-General Information ............................................................................................................... 6 1.

Purpose This  CFETP  provides  information  necessary  for  Air  Force  Career  Field  Managers  (AFCFM),  MAJCOM Functional CMSgts  MAJCOM  Functional  Managers  (MFM),  commanders,  training  managers,  supervisors, trainers  and certifiers  to plan,  develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training  individuals in AFSC 2S0XX should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial  skills,  upgrade,  qualification, advanced,  and  proficiency  training.  In addition, the plan  mandates specific functional contingency training required prior to deployment. Initial skills training is the  AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty  for award of the 3-skill level. This training is conducted by AETC at Joint  Base  San  Antonio (JBSA)  Lackland  TX.  Upgrade  training  identifies  the  mandatory  courses,  task  qualification  requirements, and  correspondence  course  completion  requirements  for award of the 3,  5, 7, and 9-skill levels. Qualification training is actual  hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position. This training  program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance  skills/knowledge required  to  do  the  job. Advanced training is formal specialty  training used for selected  Airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses,  or  on-the-job  training,  provided  to  personnel to  increase their  skills  and  knowledge  beyond  the minimum  required  for  upgrade.  Contingency  training  is  a  function  of  qualification  training  that  readies Materiel  Management  Airmen  to  perform as prescribed by the  unit  type  codes (UTC)  and  mission capability (MISCAP) statement.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are: 1.1.  Serves as a  management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a  career field training program.  In addition, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 1.3.  Lists  training courses  available  in  the  specialty,  identifies  sources  of  training,  and  the  training  delivery method. 1.4.  Identifies  major  resource constraints that  impact  full  implementation of  the  desired  career  field  training process. 2.  Uses The CFETP is used by the AFCFM, Materiel Management Functional Managers, CMSgts, and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive  training programs are available for each individual in the Materiel Management specialty. 2.1.  AETC training personnel  will develop/revise formal  resident, non-resident, field  and  exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also  work with  the  AFCFM  to  develop  acquisition  strategies  for  obtaining  resources  needed  to  provide  the  identified training. 2.2.  Materiel  Management  Functional  Managers  will  ensure  their  training programs  complement  the  CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, proficiency,  and contingency requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by  OJT,  resident  training,  contract  training,  or  exportable  courses.  MAJCOM-developed training  to  support this  AFSC  must  be  identified  for  inclusion into plan. 2.3.  Each  individual  will  complete  the  mandatory  training  requirements  specified  in  this  plan. The  lists  of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 3.  Coordination and Approval HQ  AF/A4LR  as  the  AFCFM,  is  the  approval  authority. Functional Area Council (FAC)  and  AETC  training personnel  will identify  and coordinate on the career  field training requirements.  The AFCFM  will initiate an annual  review  of  this  document  with  the  AETC  Training  Manager  and  t h e   F A C   to  ensure  currency  and accuracy.  The council will eliminate duplicate training using the  list  of  courses in Part II. 6   Section B-Career Field Progression Information 4.

Skill/Career Progression Adequate  training  and  timely  progression  from  the  apprentice  to  the  superintendent  skill  level p l a y s  a n  important  role  in  the  Air  Force's  ability  to  accomplish  its  mission. It  is  essential  that  everyone  involved  in training do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career. 5.1.  Apprentice  (3)  Level.   Initial  skills  training  in  this  specialty consists  of  the  tasks  and  knowledge training  provided  in the  3-skill  level  resident  courses  at  JBSA -Lackland,  TX.   Initial  skills  training requirements  were  identified  during  the  2S0XX  Utilization  and  Training Workshop  (U&TW)  held  at JBSA- Lackland  TX  in  November 2016.  Upon completion of initial skills training, a trainee will work with a trainer to enhance their  knowledge and skills. Course  and  Task  Qualification  to  progress in  the career  field. 3-level  assigned  airmen  should  not  be  considered  for deployment with limited exceptions. Once task certified, a trainee may perform the task  unsupervised.   Materiel Management trainees  will  be  assigned to entry level  Materiel Management  positions.  Knowledge  gained  while working in  these  entry level  positions will  provide  for  the  basis  of  further  growth  in  the  Materiel Management career field. 5.2.  Journeyman (5) Level. Journeymen are expected to build upon the skills learned as an apprentice through additional on-the-job training, completion of career development course and certification on core tasks. Increased knowledge will prepare Journeymen to assume  higher  levels of responsibility  within the  Materiel Management career  field.  After completion members should enroll in CCAF.   5.3.  Craftsman (7) Level.  Craftsman are expected to fill various supervisory and management positions such as shift NCOIC, supervisor, and task certifier.  Craftsmen will be expected to analyze the various materiel management processes and employ problem-solving techniques to achieve resolution of problems.  They must complete the appropriate career development courses and should pursue additional Supply Chain Management and  leadership courses to obtain added knowledge on management of resources and personnel.  Additionally, craftsman  must be certified on designated core tasks.  Continued academic education through CCAF and advanced training, to  include vocational programs, is encouraged. 5.4.  Superintendent  (9)  Level.  Superintendents  are  expected  to  fill  positions  such  as  Superintendent,  Section Chief,  NCOIC  and various  NAF  and MAJCOM  staff  positions. Additional  training  in  the areas  of  budget,During  up-grade  training  to  5-skill  level, 8   manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.  The Logistics  Readiness SNCO Course is highly recommended for 9-skill level award. 5.5.  Force Development Policy.  Materiel Management SNCOs, at all levels, must ensure materiel management personnel outside the  LRS are given the opportunity to  learn and  perform core tasks as  shown in the  Materiel Management STS.  The senior enlisted materiel manager must coordinate with supervisors and commanders who functionally control  materiel  management personnel outside  of  the  LRS  to  rotate  these  Airmen back  into core materiel  management processes/functions every  24  months  or  when  not  restricted  by personnel  policies  (i.e., individuals  will  not  PCS  solely  to  assure  their  reassignment  to  a  said  squadron). Retaining AF Materiel Management  Airmen  outside  the LRS or Air Force  Sustainment  Center (AFSC)  where  they are  not  qualifying or  retaining  proficiency  in  core  materiel  management  processes,  adversely  affects  the  individual’s  force development, career path, and prevents commanders from providing fully qualified Materiel Management Airmen to combatant commands during wartime operations.  6.  Training Decisions This CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Materiel Management (2S0XX) career field. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where,  and  how  to  meet  the  training requirements. The  strategy  must  be  apparent  and  affordable  to  reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach. These training decisions were made at the U&TW conducted at JBSA Lackland in November 2016. 6.1.  Initial Skills.  Initial skills training provides 2S0XX trainees with knowledge and hands on experience in the  entry level materiel management processes of storage, inventory, issue processing, research, MICAP, sourcing  assets,  repair  cycle,  deployment/contingency  wartime  support,  stock  control,  equipment, document control,  and turn-in processing.  Additionally, trainees will receive training in reject management, reading and  interpreting inquiries, and basic computer processing techniques 6.2.  Five  Level  Upgrade  Requirements.  Upgrade  to  the  5-skill level  will  require completion of  the  5-level CDCs  and  certification  of  all  5-level  core  tasks and supervisor recommendation. Core  tasks  are  identified within  this  document  and  are  the  minimum  number  of  tasks  that  an  individual  must  be  certified  on  for upgrade  to  the  higher  skill  level. Core  tasks  are  the  foundational  tasks  all  Materiel  Management  Airmen must  be  able  to  perform  whether  at  home  station  or  deployed.   Supervisors  may  determine  if  additional tasks  are  required  for  upgrade  training  based  on the Airmen’s  duty position.  Do not delay individuals from upgrade to the next skill level when resources are a constraining factor, and the supervisor/commander correctly annotates the STS explaining the constraint.  Contact the Force Support Squadron for skill-level upgrade waiver guidance and the proper procedures to document individual training records.     6.3.  Seven Level Upgrade Requirements.  7-level upgrade will be accomplished through the completion of CDCs, certification of 7-level core tasks, observation of knowledge application to include the ability to detect deficiencies caused by improper storage practices, completing surveillances, enforcement of FIFO principles, and combined supervisors/commander recommendation.  As mentioned in the 5-level upgrade requirements, training material will be designed to build upon foundational 5-level training and develop a more knowledgeable, Materiel Management Airmen who are more capable to perform at home station or deployed.  NO SKILL LEVEL WAIVERS WILL APPLY FOR 7 LEVEL UPGRADES. 6.4.  Core Task Certification.   All  core  tasks require third  party certification.   The  certifier  must  be different  than the trainer, be certified on the task being certified and possess a minimum of a 7-skill level. 7.  Community College of the Air Force 7.1.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions, however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel. The college is  regionally accredited through Air University by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges  and Schools (SACS) to award AAS degrees designed for specific Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest  multi-campus community college in the world. Upon completion of basic military training and assignment to an AF  career field, all enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Science degree. In order to be awarded, degree requirements must be successfully  completed before the student separates from the Air Force, retires, or is commissioned as an officer. See the CCAF  programs at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf  9  for details regarding the AAS degree programs.  7.2.  CCAF Degree Requirements.

Superintendent-Level Training There are no known constraints.16  Section E-Transitional Training Guide: There are currently no transitional training requirements.  This area is reserved. Part II Section A-Specialty Training Standard 1.  Implementation The  implementation of  this  STS  for  technical  training  provided  by  Air  Education  and  Training  Command  is with class beginning 20180108 (2S031). 2.  Purpose 2.1.  Column 1 (Task, Knowledge and Technical References) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airman to perform duties in the 3, 5, and 7-skill level. Column 2 identifies the core tasks  that  must  be  certified  for  upgrade  to  the  next  higher  skill  level.  These  are  the  minimum  core  tasks; supervisors may assign additional core tasks, as deemed appropriate, that must be certified for upgrade to the next higher skill level.  When resources (training expertise, equipment, etc.) are not available to certify an individual on  a core task,  the Commander will  so annotate  the STS stating  that resources  are not available.  Upgrade training will not be denied to individuals who, through lack of resources, cannot be core task certified. However, every  attempt  to  obtain  the training  through  contractors,  ANG, AFRC,  etc…must  be  exhausted before core task waiver requests are submitted for approval. (NO SKILL LEVEL WIAVERS WILL BE GIVEN FOR 7 SKILL LEVEL). Contact the Military Personnel Flight for guidance and the proper  procedures to annotate the individuals training record when core task training cannot be accomplished. Materiel  management  personnel in outside units, i.e., maintenance,  civil engineers,  etc., will not use  this  document  exclusively  when  they  are  supported  by a materiel management account.  Rather, the host LRS Training Section  will be contacted for assistance.  Column 3  is the  administrative area  for training start/stop dates, trainer, trainee and certifier initials.  Column 4 lists 3, 5, and 7-skill level training proficiency codes. 2.2. Qualitative  Requirements.  Attachment  1  contains  the  proficiency  code  key  used  to  indicate  the  level  of training  and knowledge  provided  by  resident  training,  career  development  courses,  and web-based  training course, once developed/fielded 2.3. Attachments 1 and 2 become a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form  623,  On-The-Job  Training  Record,  and  IAW  AFI  36-2201.  When  used  as  a  JQS,  the  following requirements apply: 2.3.1.  Documentation.  Document  and  certify  completion  of  training.  Identify  duty  position  requirements  by circling the subparagraph number next to the task statement.  As a minimum, complete the following columns in Part  2  of  the  CFETP: Training  start  date,  Training  Completed  date,  Trainee  Initials,  Trainer  Initials,  Certifier Initials.  An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM. NOTE:  The  AFCFM  may  supplement  these  minimum  documentation  procedures  as  needed  or  deemed necessary for their career field. 2.3.1.1. Converting  from  Old  Document  to  CFETP. Use  the  new  CFETP  to  identify  and  certify  all  past  and current task qualifications.  Transcribe qualifications in the following manner: For those tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, evaluate current qualifications and, when verified, recertify using current date  as completion date  and  enter  trainee and  supervisor’s  initials. When transcribing previous certification for tasks not required in the current duty position, carry forward only the previous completion date of certification (not the initials of another person).  If and  when transcribed tasks become duty position requirements, recertify using standard  certification  procedures. The  person  whose  initials  appear  in  the  trainer or  certifier  block  during  the transcription process  must  meet the  requirements of their respective roles.  Upon completion of the transcription process, give the old CFETP to the member. 2.3.1.2. Documenting Career Knowledge.   When a  CDC is  not available: the supervisor identifies STS training  references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a  minimum, that trainees cover the  mandatory  items  in AFECD.  For two-time CDC  course exam  failures:  supervisors  identify  all STS 17          items  corresponding to  the  areas  covered  by the  CDC.   The  trainee  completes a  study  of  STS  references, undergoes  evaluation  by  the task  certifier  receives  certification  on  the   STS   if  approved  by  the  applicable  approval  authority.  NOTE:  Career Knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver. 2.3.1.3. Decertification and  Recertification.  When  an  Airman  is  found  to  be  unqualified  on  a  task  previously certified  for  his  or  her  position,  the  supervisor  lines  through  the  previous  certification  or  deletes  previous certification when using automated systems.  Appropriate remarks are entered on the  AF Form 623A,  On-The- Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for decertification. The individual is recertified (if required) by both erasing the old entries and writing in the new or by using correction fluid (if the entries were made in ink) over the previously certified entry. 2.3.2. Training  Standard. Tasks  are  trained  and  qualified  to  the  go/no  go  level. Go  means  the  individual  can perform the task without assistance, meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. 2.3.3. Application. This STS applies to the training of the Total Force. Unit Commanders of non-LRS units with materiel  management  personnel  assigned  coordinate  training  needs  through  the  host  LRS  Training  Section  or respective  MAJCOM  Functional  Manager  if  there  is  no  LRS  on  the  base.  This  will  ensure  qualified trainers/certifiers  are  available  and  training  is  accomplished  on  all  core  tasks.  Waiver  authority  for  core  task certification is the AFCFM. 2.4. Training Business Area (TBA) is the approved, mandatory method for tracking and documenting training for the Materiel Management career field.  Maintain paper  copies  of  the  master  training  plan  (MTP)  for  individual work centers IAW AFI 36-2201. 2.5. The Training Standard is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the Airman  Advancement  Division  by senior  NCOs  with  extensive  practical  experience  in  their  career  fields.  The  tests  sample  knowledge  of  STS subject  matter  areas  judged  by  test  development  team  members  as  most  appropriate  for  promotion  to  higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or the Air Force Reserve. 3.

(Principles) Can analyze facts and principles and draw conclusions about the subject.  (Analysis) Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject.  (Evaluation) Levels Explanations *  A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.  (Example:  b and 1b)  **  A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.  -  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.  X  This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.    NOTE:  All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time. 19  1.  Tasks, Knowledge And Technical References   Attachment 2 AFSC 2S0X1 STS 2.

Commanders  and  supervisors,  at  all  levels,  should  establish  an  effective  contingency/expeditionary training program  that  takes  into  account  the  normal  AEF  battle  rhythm. The  following  tables  prescribe  the  minimum essential  training  tasks  Airmen  require  training  and  certification on  to  meet  the  stated  capability of  the  Unit Type  Code  (UTC). As  the  minimum  training  requirements,  commanders  should  use  completion  of  training associated  with assigned UTCs as the determination of capability readiness in the AEF Reporting Tool (ART). 2. Ideally,  Airmen/teams should  begin the  specified  training 4-6  months before  their  AEF  deployment.   Flight superintendents/certifying officials will assess an Airmen’s ability to perform the task to the “Go,” “No-Go” level.  A copy of the applicable training table, indicating completed training, should be placed in the Airman’s AF Form  623, On-the-Job Training Record, and maintained until return from deployment. 3. UTCs/capabilities requiring training/certifying on specialized materiel handling (i.e., all-terrain fork lift) tasks require a minimum of 50 percent of personnel assigned against that UTC be certified on those tasks. 4. All appropriate core tasks in addition to UTC requirements must be met. 5. The MAJCOM Functional Manager is the waiver authority for required training.38   Flight Superintendent Signature/Date  etaD tratS noitelpmoC etaD slaitinI eeniarT reniarT etaD/slaitinI        STS
