Under  OCWA,  SAPM  responsibilities  will  transfer  with  other  program management  responsibilities  as  they  transfer  from  one  center  to  another.    The  effective date  of  SAPM  responsibility-transfer  will  coincide  with  the  flag  transfer  of  program management responsibilities from one center to another. 1.4.6.9.1.  The intent  of transition  planning is  to ensure timely and effective transfer of all SAPM program management responsibilities.  The goal is a seamless transfer of responsibilities over time, sufficient to develop the appropriate infrastructure support.  The  objectives  of  a  successful  transition  are  to  optimize  program  execution  and  to minimize the negative impact on the delivery of capability and sustainment.   20  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 1.4.6.9.2.  SAPM  and  other  FMS-related  issues  are  discussed  in  the  appropriate transition  planning  document  using  existing  FMS  case  assignment  processes.    The transition  planning  document  must  be  agreed  to  by  all  parties.    Transition  will  be delayed until these agreements are in place and the appropriate funding is authorized and available.  Notification to partners must also take place. 1.4.6.9.3.  Program  management  responsibility  for  FMS  cases  normally  will  not  be transferred  while  the  case  is  in  execution;    however,  selected  FMS  programs  with significant  time  remaining  until  completion  could  be  considered  for  transfer.    New FMS  workload  will  be  identified  and  will  be  part  of  the  program  management responsibilities  at  the  transferred  location;  existing  FMS  cases  will  be  considered residual tasks and will be performed at the losing workload center. 1.4.6.9.4.  All appropriate processes and work instructions must be reviewed, revised and  coordinated  between  the  losing  and  gaining  organizations.    Joint  processes  are developed  as  required.    During  the  transition  period,  ensure  that  business  processes are coordinated with the gaining and losing organizations and FMS partners. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   21  Chapter 2 GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR SECURITY COOPERATION AND SECURITY ASSISTANCE 2.1.  Standards of Conduct. 2.1.1.  DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), prescribes standards of conduct for Air Force military and civilian personnel.    It  prohibits,  among other things, conflicts  of interest between  official  duties  and  personal  conduct.    This  includes  unauthorized  personal  use  of United States Government (USG) funds or property.  Likewise, unauthorized use of foreign funds and property is prohibited. 2.2.  Foreign Disclosure. 2.2.1.  All  disclosures and  releases of military information  and materiel  to  foreign nationals resulting  from  international  affairs  and  security  assistance  activities  must  be  authorized  in accordance  with  AFPD  16-2,  Disclosure  of  Military  Information  to  Foreign  Governments and  International  Organizations  and  AFI  16-201,  Air  Force  Foreign  Disclosure  and Technology Transfer Program. 2.2.2.  Letters  of  Offer  and  Acceptance  (LOAs),  international  agreements  with  a  foreign government  or  international  organization,  or  other  appropriate  legal  arrangement  must  be concluded prior to  Foreign Disclosure Officers (FDOs) authorizing disclosures of classified military information (CMI) and controlled unclassified military information (CUMI) related to  the  transfer  of  defense  articles,  services,  or  technical  data.    In  addition,  Air  Force  (AF) personnel  may  disclose  CMI  and  controlled  CUMI  only  to  foreign  representatives  who possess  an  appropriate  security  clearance  and  need-to-know  basis  as  verified  in  their  visit request and in accordance with disclosure guidance provided by the FDO. 2.3.  Communications within DoD. 2.3.1.  Implementing commands, agencies, Security Assistance Program Managers (SAPMs), Case  Managers  (CM),  Line  Managers,  and  partners  may  communicate  directly  with  each other  on  security  assistance  issues.    They  must  refer  unresolved  guidance  and  procedural matters through the appropriate Major Command (MAJCOM) to Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force/International Affairs (SAF/IA) for resolution. 2.4.  Communications with Contractors. 2.4.1.  The  military  departments  (MILDEPs)  satisfy  foreign  military  sale  (FMS)  case requirements  from  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  stocks  or  procurement  from  contractors.  Partners may procure directly from contractors through a direct commercial sale (DCS).  The USG  may  also  sell  defense  articles  to  United  States  companies  for  incorporation  into  end-items that are the subject of DCS (under the terms of Section 30 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA)). 2.4.2.  In all cases, AF personnel must comply with all ethics and contracting regulations, as well  as  the  policies  and  procedures  in  DoD  5105.38-M,  Security  Assistance  Management Manual (SAMM).   22  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 2.4.3.  For DCS inquiries, the contractor should be directed to the Department of Commerce (DoC) (for trade issues and information) and the Department of State (DoS) (for arms export issues and information). 2.4.4.  When  release  of  information  about  a  defense  article  is  under  National  Disclosure Policy  (NDP)  review,  AF  personnel  will  not  discuss  or  provide  any  information  regarding release  to  contractors  until  a  final  decision  is  made.    The  contractor  may  be  informed  only that the sale is currently under review. 2.4.5.  AF personnel will not solicit or recommend sole source procurement. 2.5.  Partner Participation at Contract Negotiations. 2.5.1.  Only the USG negotiates terms and conditions of procurement contracts to meet case requirements.    Partner  representatives  usually  are  not  allowed  to  take  part  in  USG  contract price negotiations, unless the contracting officer deems it appropriate and necessary.  Partner representatives can participate in specifications development, delivery schedule development, identification of warranties, and other contractual requirements unique to the partner. 2.6.  Visits by Foreign Nationals. 2.6.1.  General Visit Policies and Procedures. 2.6.1.1.  A  visit  authorization  does  not  constitute  the  legal  basis  for  providing  defense articles, services (including training) or technical data to foreign governments. 2.6.1.2.  Foreign governments are required to submit visit requests for US citizens acting on the foreign government’s behalf when visiting AF facilities. 2.6.1.3.  For any foreign representative and foreign national visit, the US contact officer must ensure physical controls are implemented to limit visitor access to that information authorized for disclosure.  Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force/International Affairs, Foreign  Disclosure,  Weapons  and  Technology  Transfer  Division  (SAF/IAPD)  does  not usually  require  written  security  plans  for  one-time  or  recurring  visits.    However, SAF/IAPD or other functional program managers, in response to specific circumstances may require US contact officers to prepare security plans on a case-by-case basis for one-time or recurring visits.  One-time and recurring visits do not meet the requirements for unescorted access to AF facilities. 2.6.1.4.  AF  organizations  ensure  a  badge  or  pass  is  issued  that  clearly  identifies  the bearer as a foreign representative. 2.6.1.5.  AF military or civilian personnel assigned to the organization will escort foreign representatives in facilities where access to CMI or CUMI will or may occur.  Escorts for foreign  representatives  to  and  within  other  facilities  are  subject  to  local  base  security procedures. 2.6.1.6.  Air Force contact officers organizing US guest lecturers for professional military education  (PME)  activities  will  inform  such  guests  that  foreign  nationals  are  in attendance and that the guests must obtain disclosure approval from their servicing FDO prior to any presentation where CMI or CUMI may be discussed. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   23  2.6.1.7.  AF  contact  officers  organizing  foreign  guest  lecturers  for  PME  activities  will brief  students  regarding  disclosure  guidelines  prior  to  the  arrival  of  foreign  guest lecturers. 2.6.2.  Self-Invited Visits.  All requests for visits by foreign nationals pertaining to a current or proposed security assistance case must be sent to SAF/IAPD.  For most visits, the partner should send the information through its embassy in Washington, D.C. to SAF/IAPD at least 30  days  before  the  arrival  date  of  the  visitors.    International  partners  send  their  requests directly to SAF/IAPD.  These procedures apply to visits of AF or contractor facilities.  The partner pays all travel and visit expenses for its representatives. 2.6.3.  AF-Sponsored Visits.  The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) and Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) may invite foreign nationals to take part in distinguished visitor tours.  These visit requests do not need to go through US diplomatic channels because the Office of the  Vice  Chief  of  Staff,  Foreign  Liaison  Division  (USAF/CVAI)  arranges  these  tours.    In addition, the SECAF and CSAF may also invite their foreign counterparts in accordance with Instructions  (HOI)  16-201,  SECAF/CSAF  Foreign (IAW)  Headquarters  Operating Counterpart Visit Program.  Other visits by foreign representatives invited by the DoD must be approved by SAF/IAPD in advance of the visits. 2.6.4.  Foreign  Visit  System  (FVS).    The  FVS  is  part  of  the  Security  Policy  Automation Network (SPAN) sub-system, which supports staffing and databases for processing requests for visits by foreign nationals to DoD activities and defense contractors. 2.6.5.  Access Control. 2.6.5.1.  AF  personnel  will  not  approve  unescorted  access  for  foreign  representatives  to AF restricted or controlled areas or other facilities where access to CMI or CUMI will or may occur, unless all of the following conditions have been met: 2.6.5.1.1.  The  foreign  national’s  government  extends  reciprocal  privileges  to  DoD personnel. 2.6.5.1.2.  The foreign national is sponsored by his or her government or international organization  through  a  formal  visit  request,  and  the  need  for  frequent  access  is justified. 2.6.5.1.3.  Security  measures  are  in  place  to  limit  access  to  only  CMI  and  CUMI authorized for disclosure. 2.6.5.1.4.  A  badge  or  pass  is  issued  that  clearly  identifies  the  bearer  as  a  foreign representative.  Such ID will be valid only for a specific facility during normal duty hours.    AF  contact  officers  will  make  specific  arrangements  for  access  during  non-duty hours on a case-by-case basis with the FDO and all offices having a functional interest in the extended duty hours. 2.6.5.1.5.  The  badge  or  pass  will  be  displayed  on  the  outer  clothing  so  that  it  is clearly visible. 2.6.6.  Wearing of Uniforms.  All foreign nationals visiting DoD installations, as approved by  SAF/IAPD,  or  assigned  under  the  Military  Personnel  Exchange  Program  (MPEP),  as approved  by  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force/International  Affairs,  International Airmen  Division  (SAF/IAPA)  in  coordination  with  SAF/IAPD,  shall  be  issued  badges  or   24  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 passes that clearly identify them  as foreign nationals.   All  foreign nationals  participating in an MPEP must wear their military uniforms during duty hours on DoD installations, except as directed by their in-country US supervisor. 2.7.  USG Personnel Travel. 2.7.1.  US  military  and  civilians  on  security  assistance  travel  (whether  financed  by  FMS administrative  (admin)  funds,  FMS  case  funds,  or  other  security  assistance  funds)  must follow the policies and procedures outlined in the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), Volume  1,  Uniformed  Service  Personnel;  the  Joint  Travel  Regulations,  Volume  2, Department  of  Defense  Civilian  Personnel;  AFI  65-601,  Volume  1,  Budget  Guidance  and Procedures;  AFI  33-328,  Administrative  Orders;  and  AFI  24-101,  Passenger  Movement.  Travel  will be held  to  the minimum  needed  for  effective management.   Wherever possible, use  alternative  methods  of  communication  such  as  video  teleconferencing  and  conference calls. 2.7.2.  Carrier and Class. The security assistance traveler must use the same carrier, routings, and class of service required of other DoD travelers. 2.7.2.1.  The LOA shall not contain a requirement or an authorization to use a designated foreign  air  carrier,  and  shall  not  require  or  authorize  a  class  of  service  other  than economy  for  DoD  personnel  travel  associated  with  the  case.    Waivers  for  security assistance travelers are the same as those for other DoD travelers. 2.7.2.2.  The  SECAF  approves  exceptions  to  transportation  and  travel  guidance  for premium  class  air  travel.    Request  for  premium  class  air  travel  will  be  submitted  in accordance  with  AFI  24-101.    The  office  that  arranges  premium  air  travel  will  ensure first-class travel procedures are complied with, and after travel is completed, prepares the First Class Air Accommodations Report, IRCN:  0167GSASA. 2.7.3.  Air  Movement  To,  From,  Within,  and  Between  Overseas  Areas.    First consideration is given to Air Mobility Command (AMC)-procured channel airlift services.  If AMC-procured  channel  airlift  does  not  meet  security  assistance  mission  requirements, travelers must request authorization from their servicing Traffic Management Office (TMO) to use other transportation sources. 2.7.3.1.  If  the  request  is  approved,  the  travel  office  will  issue  tickets  for  commercial airlines in the following order of precedence. 2.7.3.1.1.  General Services Administration (GSA) airlift contracted through the city-pair program. 2.7.3.1.2.  Other US Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) carriers. 2.7.3.1.3.  DoD-approved, non-CRAF US Flag carriers. 2.7.3.1.4.  Scheduled service on US  air carriers that are neither DoD-approved nor  -disapproved. 2.7.3.1.5.  DoD-approved foreign flag carriers.  Foreign flag air carriers will only be utilized when US air carriers are not available to meet mission requirements. 2.7.3.1.6.  Scheduled  service  on  foreign  air  carriers  that  are  neither  approved  nor disapproved by the DoD. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   25  2.7.3.1.7.  Other  US  military  organic  lift,  when  available,  within  and  between overseas areas. 2.7.3.2.  For CONUS travel, the travel office selects the commercial service (giving first consideration  to  government  contract  carriers)  that  meets  the  traveler’s  mission requirements for the lowest overall cost. 2.7.4.  Request  to  Remain  Overnight  (RON).    RONs  may  be  authorized  during  overseas travel in accordance with the JFTR, the JTR, and AFI 24-101.  A RON cannot be authorized when an employee chooses to travel by an indirect route.  The use of non-contract carriers or use  of  matching  ―government  fares‖  to  permit  a  RON  is  a  breach  of  contract  between  the USG  and  the  contracted  air  carriers.    Advance  travel  planning  will  help  facilitate coordination  of travel  arrangements  consistent  with  mission requirements. the  most  economical 2.7.5.  Country  Clearances.    Official  visitors  to  foreign  nations  must  adhere  to  the requirements of DoD Directive (DoDD) 4500.54E, DoD Foreign Clearance Program (FCP), including  coordination  with  the  in-country  Security  Cooperation  Officer  (SCO).    The SAPM/CM  is  responsible  for  obtaining  overseas  country-special  area  access  and  theater clearances for anyone traveling in support of the program, including contractors. 2.7.6.  SCO Travel.  SCO travel should not be FMS case funded unless: 2.7.6.1.  Travel is solely in support of an FMS program. 2.7.6.2.  The SCO is performing or supporting program management functions for either the USG or the partner. 2.7.6.3.  The partner, the CM, or the SAPM has requested the SCO’s presence. 2.8.  Quality of Support. 2.8.1.  All  security  assistance  program  management  must  meet  the  same  high  standards  of efficiency  and  conduct  that  apply  to  AF  activities.    The  AF  supports  US  foreign  policy objectives  by  delivering  high-quality  articles  and  services  in  a  timely  manner,  and  at  a reasonable  price.    For  a  description  of  Standard  Level  of  Service  (SLS)  see  paragraph 4.6.2.11. 2.8.2.  Delivery  schedules  are  set  for  system  end-items  to  ensure  effective  logistics  support and  training.    Security  assistance  partner  should  understand  the  requirement  for  lead-time, including procurement, for articles and services. 2.8.3.  The  DoD  priority  system  and  the  peculiarities  of  certain  articles  and  services  will affect  lead-time.    AF  security  assistance  personnel  must  stress  these  factors  during  each transaction, to ensure common understanding between the AF and the partner on delivery of articles and services. 2.9.  Management of Case Funded Personal Property. 2.9.1.  Personal  property  consists  of  various  types  of  equipment  and  vehicles,  to  include office  equipment  (e.g.,  desks,  computers),  which  may  be  purchased  with  case  funds  in support  of  a  particular  FMS  program,  including  both  individual  partner  programs  and programs  involving  multiple  participating  countries  such  as  the  Technical  Coordination   26  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 Program (TCP)/International Engine Management Program (IEMP), and Electronic Combat International Security Assistance Program (ECISAP). 2.9.2.  The international partner may request communication support services with USG team members  in  support  of  the  partner’s  security  assistance  programs  to  keep  abreast  of  any rapidly  developing  situations.    To  accommodate  this  requirement,  the  international  partner may  request  communication  support  services  for  USG  personnel  be  included  on  the  FMS case.  These communication support services, chargeable to the case, will be for the service plan  and  not  the  equipment.    Case  funding  is  appropriate  for  these  costs,  since  USG personnel will be issued a Blackberry (BB) from the organization’s Information Technology (IT)  inventory,  in  direct  support  of  the  foreign  partner.    The  IT  personnel  will  program  the BB  for  access  to  the  AF  Network.    The  BB  will  remain  in  possession  and  used  by  USG personnel only, and should not be considered foreign-owned or controlled.  It will be owned by  the  USG  and  under  its  control  at  all  times.    The  BB  service  will  be  terminated  when deemed no longer required on the case. 2.9.3.  Each  organization  is  required  to  appoint  an  equipment  custodian.    The  equipment custodian  will  properly  account  for  all  FMS-owned  equipment,  citing  applicable  case  lines and  funding  documents.    For  equipment  purchased  with  individual  partner  case  funds,  the partner  retains  the  title  to  the  equipment,  but  possession  resides  with  the  purchasing organization responsible for its protection and accountability.  For equipment purchased with multiple-partner  funded  programs  such  as  TCPs/IEMPs  or  ECISAP,  the  equipment  resides within the specific TCP/IEMP or ECISAP, and the program has ownership.  Partners should follow the guidance that costs be directly attributable to supporting the FMS mission. 2.9.4.  When equipment is purchased with individual partner funds and becomes obsolete or no longer functions, the AF  purchasing organization will contact  the partner for disposition instructions.    If  the  partner  directs  the  equipment  to  be  turned  over  to  them,  the  AF purchasing  organization  will  package  and  ship  the  equipment  according  to  directions furnished by the partner.  All associated packaging and shipping costs will be charged to the FMS  case.    All  sensitive  materiel  must  be  deleted  from  the  equipment  before  disposal  or transfer to the partner. 2.9.5.  Disposal.  If the partner does not direct the equipment to be returned, disposal action will be initiated and any costs incurred will be charged to the FMS country or FMS countries when equipment is purchased with multiple-partner funded programs. 2.9.5.1.  If  the  market  value  exceeds  the  admin  cost  of  disposal,  then  the  equipment should be processed through the local DLA Disposition Services.  Twenty percent of the sale  proceeds  will  be  reimbursed  to  DLA  Disposition  Services  to  cover  its  processing costs.    The  remaining  eighty  percent  of  sale  proceeds  will  be  refunded  to  the  partner’s trust fund in those instances where a single partner case was used to fund the purchase. 2.9.5.2.  If  equipment  was  purchased  with  multiple  case  funds  and  market  value  is determined  to  exceed  admin  cost  of  disposal,  twenty  percent  of  the  sales  value  will  be reimbursed to the DLA Disposition Services to cover processing costs and the remaining eighty  percent  of  the  sales  proceeds  will  be  reinvested  into  the  TCP/IEMP/ECISAP  or other multiple partner funded program to defray future expenses.  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   27  2.10.  Real Property Management. 2.10.1.  Facilities  on  military  bases  may  be  constructed  or  renovated  for  FMS  purposes, usually for training. 2.10.2.  AF is required to annually report on all physical assets on CONUS bases IAW AFI 32-9005,  Real  Property  Accountability  and  Reporting.    The  Automated  Civil  Engineering Systems Real Property Modules (ACES-RP) is the AF system of record to properly account for FMS real property assets to meet financial and physical reporting requirements. 2.10.3.  Real  property  for  non-US  military  activities  is  reportable  as  ―owned  by  the  AF  for physical  accountability  purposes  only.‖    This  accountability  is  necessary  because  no  other government entity can ―own‖ real property on CONUS military bases. 2.10.4.  Real  Property Accountability Officers (RPAOs) should complete a DD Form 1354, Transfer  and  Acceptance  of  Military  Real  Property  and  record  the  property  as  ―owned‖  by the  AF  in  the  ACES-RP  module.    RPAOs  should  ensure  the  appropriate  cost  and organizational codes are entered correctly for sustainment, restoration and modernization, so that ACES-RP will not report these facilities on the AF financial statement.  Fund codes are available  in  ACES-RP  that  identify  FMS  property  as  fully  sustained  by  the  foreign government. 2.11.  Condition of AF Articles. 2.11.1.  Article condition codes for FMS, if applicable, must be in the LOA.  These codes are described in paragraph 2b of the LOA information sheet that is attached to each LOA. 2.11.2.  Articles supplied to the partner from the AF inventory or excess stock must meet the serviceability  standards  in  the  applicable  technical  instructions  or  orders,  unless  otherwise specified  in  the  LOA.    Costs  to  upgrade  items  to  these  standards  will  be  charged  to  the partner in the LOA.  While articles from stock must be serviceable, they may or may not be new and unused. 2.11.3.  If the AF agrees to sell only new and unused articles under FMS, this must be stated in  the  LOA.    Requisitions  for  new  and  unused  articles  must  have  a  ―6P‖  advice  code  and cannot be placed against blanket order ―FMSO II‖ cases. 2.11.4.  The  AF  may  transfer  certain  articles  on  an  as-is,  where-is  basis.    The  AF  is  not responsible  for  the  repair,  support  or  movement  of  these  articles,  unless  the  LOA  indicates otherwise.    The  partner  should  inspect  the  articles  to  be  transferred,  before  document preparation.    Any  USG  cost  involved  in  the  inspection  should  be  included  in  the  LOA.  Recipient countries are encouraged to conduct a joint visual inspection prior to transfer of the items.  The LOA must show the condition of the articles, work to be done, and an estimate of the associated costs in separate line items. 2.12.  Direct Commercial Sales (DCS)/FMS Hybrid Program. 2.12.1.  Export  sales  and  transfers  of  US  defense  systems  and  associated  services  are complex transactions involving three primary stakeholders or parties:  the USG, international partners  (allied  and  friendly  governments/organizations)  and  defense  contractors  and suppliers  (US  and  international).    International  partners  have  a  wide  array  of  choices available in satisfying their defense needs.  If an international partner decides to acquire US defense  articles  and  services,  they  normally  have  the  option  of  acquiring  those  articles  and   28  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 services  through  DCS  arrangement,  the  FMS  programs,  or  some  combination  of  DCS  and FMS (DCS/FMS Hybrid Program).  Countries normally receive a better product when there is  a  single  manager  of  the  total  program.    Programs  split  between  FMS  and  DCS  do  not provide this single manager.  The AF will discourage the use of such a split program, unless the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) authorizes it. 2.12.2.  In  support  of  US  national  security  objectives  and  to  promote  interoperability  and economies of scale, the DoD prefers allies and friendly nations to acquire US systems versus foreign  systems.    However,  the  DoD  is  generally  neutral  regarding  a  foreign  nation’s decision to  purchase US defense  articles and services by  FMS versus DCS, unless directed by  law/guidance.    By  guidance,  USG  will  not  compete  with  US  industry  for  elements  of  a potential sale. 2.12.3.  In the case of industry request for FMS support relating to a DCS contract, industry should  advise  the  foreign  purchaser  if  FMS  articles/services  are  required  and  to  submit  an LOR for FMS articles/services in  order to  obtain support for the DCS equipment  purchase.  Industry should inform  DSCA and the relevant implementing agency of the possibility of a requirement for FMS support. 2.13.  Items Managed by Other Agencies. 2.13.1.  The  AF  implements  security  assistance  programs  for  defense  articles  and  services under its cognizance, including articles stocked, stored, issued and procured by the AF.  The AF  may  support  FMS  items  available  from  other  MILDEPs,  DoD  components,  or  USG agencies.    Sustainment  support  for  these  items  should  come  from  the  DoD  component controlling the item. 2.14.  Nonstandard Items and Parts and Repair Ordering System (PROS). 2.14.1.  The AF provides initial and sustainment logistics support for nonstandard items and difficult-to-support  standard  items  when  the  DoD  source  cannot  provide  support  or  when DoD organic capability is neither available nor timely. 2.14.1.1.  Logistics sustainment support may include buying and repairing or overhauling nonstandard  items  and  standard  items  (on  an  exception  basis),  and  revising  or  updating Country Standard Technical Orders (CSTO) for nonstandard items.  The LOA must state specifically what support will be given. 2.14.2.  The following items may be supplied on an FMS case through the PROS program (a program administered by AFSAC). 2.14.2.1.  Items that are no longer in the DoD inventory, but are still used by the partner.  Note:  This is on an exception basis for ―difficult-to-support standard items.‖ 2.14.2.2.  Standard  items  determined  to  be  non-supportable  by  the  managing  DoD activity may be supported through PROS.  For AF-managed items, the data package and approved repair/procurement sources must be provided. 2.14.2.3.  Partner-unique parts never used by the AF. 2.14.2.4.  Commercial part-numbered items that have military application. 2.14.3.  LOAs should state the scope of the rights to data (limited or unlimited) sought by the purchaser and that the USG has the same rights to the data as the partner.  This means that AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   29  the USG has the right  to furnish  technical  orders (TO) and data to  future FMS partners (as allowed by the contract) without the permission of the original FMS partner. 2.14.4.  The AF does not sell or support a commercial system, unless the partner uses it as a defense  article  or  service.    If  a  partner  wants  to  buy  a  commercial  system  of  any  kind,  the partner  should  consider  a  DCS.    The  provision  of  commercial  systems  via  FMS  will  be determined on a case-by-case basis. 2.14.5.  A  partner-peculiar  part  number  and  corresponding  national  stock  number  (NSN) shall be assigned to any line replaceable units (LRU) that contain classified data, when like US  LRUs  or  other  countries'  LRUs  have  different  data  that  is  sensitive  to  the  individual partner's  security.    This  partner-peculiar  coding  process  provides  the  capability  to  readily identify and transport classified LRUs to the proper partner. 2.15.  Obsolete or Deactivated Items. 2.15.1.  Obsolete  Items.    The  AF  must  advise  partners  when  articles  are  subject  to Diminishing  Manufacturing  Sources  (DMS),  or  are  becoming  obsolete,  in  order  for  the partner to participate in parts buy-outs or take other measures for future support. 2.15.2.  Items  for  Systems  Deactivated  by  the  AF.  The  AF will provide item  support on deactivated systems in accordance with AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 9, Security Assistance Program Procedures. 2.16.  FMS Development Programs. through 2.16.1.  The AF  will decide on  a case-by-case basis whether to  sell systems  and equipment involving  significant  operational  test  and  evaluation  (OT&E).    The  country  director  will submit  a  ―Yockey‖  waiver the  DSCA,  Operations  Directorate,  Region (DSCA/OPS/Region).    A  ―Yockey‖  waiver  is  a  policy  waiver  in  which  the  Office  of  the Under  Secretary  of  Defense,  Acquisition,  Technology  and  Logistics  (OUSD  (AT&L)) approval is required before issuing P&A data or LOAs for major defense equipment (MDE) that has not  undergone research, development,  test  and evaluation  (RDT&E).  The Country Program  Director  (CPD)  at  DSCA  must  approve  all  FMS  developmental  programs  in  the acquisition cycle.  The item may be sold by either commercial or FMS methods, subject to OUSD (AT&L) approval.  Because these systems have not completed operational testing and evaluation,  partners  are  encouraged  to  buy  systems  already  in  the  AF  inventory.    Partner requests  for  FMS  developmental  programs  must  be  sent  to  the  SAF/IA  Country  Director.  Requests must include detailed information on the purchaser's specific requirements.  These requests  should  be  in  accordance  with  an  Air  Force  Capabilities  Development  Document (CDD) and AFI 10-601, Operational Capability Requirements Development. 2.16.2.  The SCO may  assist  the partner with  writing requests for developmental  programs.  These  requests  will  be  processed  through  the  same  channels  as  requests  for  standard  FMS cases. 2.16.3.  FMS developmental program plans approved by OUSD (AT&L) are sent through the SAF/IA  Country  Director  to  the  partner.    The  developmental  program  plan  must  include  a schedule  for  preparing  the  LOA.    The  AF  will  provide  the  LOA  only  when  the  partner requests  it  and  only  after  the  partner  approves  the  FMS  developmental  program  plan.    The   30  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 CM  will  write  the  case  and  hold  submission  to  the  DSCA,  Operations  Directorate,  Case Writing Division (DSCA/OPS/CWD) until it is approved. 2.17.  Quality Assurance Inspection. 2.17.1.  The USG provides quality assurance inspection for partner’s direct acquisitions only under Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) LOAs. 2.18.  Conversion to Contractor-Furnished Equipment (CFE). 2.18.1.  FMS  articles  may  be  converted  from  governmentfurnished  equipment  (GFE)  to contractor-furnished  equipment  (CFE)  only  if  needed  to  perform  the  program  in  a  timely manner. An LOA amendment may be required to change the source of supply and cost. 2.19.  Use  of  AF  Equipment/Personnel  to  Support  International  Air  Shows  and  Trade Exhibitions. 2.19.1.  International  Air  Shows  and  Trade  Exhibitions.    International  Air  Shows  and Trade Exhibitions are events held outside the US that are organized primarily for promoting the  sale  of  aerospace  and  other  defense  products.    Events  consisting  only  of  the  aerobatic demonstration or static display of aircraft and other defense equipment for public enjoyment and  community  relations,  held  on  specifically  designated  public  days  of  international  air shows or trade exhibitions are governed by AFPD 35-1, Public Affairs Management, AFI 35-105, Community Relations, and AFI 35-110, U.S. Air Force Band Program. 2.19.2.  AF Aircraft, Articles, or Services.  Contractors should send requests for the use of AF aircraft to the respective AFMC aircraft program office, which will notify Deputy Under Secretary  of the  Air  Force/International  Affairs,  Armaments  Cooperation  Division (SAF/IAPQ).    SAF/IAPQ  will  provide  direction  after  the,  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air Force/Acquisition,  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Contracting  (SAF/AQC)  has  coordinated the  request  within  the  HAF.    AFI  64-103,  Leasing  Non-Excess  USAF  Aircraft,  Aircraft-Related  Equipment  and  Other  Personal  Property  to  Non-Government  Organizations, contains  procedures  for  leasing  DoD  aircraft  to  manufacturers  for  air  shows.    SAF/AQC  is responsible for these processes.   In addition,  DoDI 7230.08,  Leases and  Demonstrations  of DoD  Equipment,  outlines  guidance  and  responsibility  for  leasing  and  demonstrating  DoD equipment to defense contractors at international air shows or trade exhibitions. 2.19.3.  AF  Personnel.    The  level  of  involvement  by  AF  personnel  at  specific  exhibitions depends on whether the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) guidance allows for direct participation as defined in DoDI 7230.08.  After obtaining guidance from SAF/IAPQ on the level  of  DoD  participation  at  a  specific  international  air  show  and  trade  exhibition,  the MAJCOM  or  the  assigned  office  in  the  AF  will  approve  or  disapprove  requests  for  AF personnel  attendance.    AF  personnel  attending  these  shows  will  follow  the  standards  of conduct in DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER). 2.19.4.  Direct  DoD  Participation.    Direct  DoD  participation  occurs  when  DoD  personnel are  involved  in  the  static  displays  providing  information  on  DoD  systems  and  technology, demonstration  (aerial  or  live),  manning  of  defense  equipment,  and  the  transportation  of equipment that will be part of a DoD exhibit or otherwise employed by the DoD itself at an international  trade  exhibition.    Manning  by  DoD  employees  includes  operating  equipment, standing  by  displayed  equipment,  and  answering  questions  on  the  equipment.    Direct  DoD AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   31  participation  also  includes  the  presence  of  DoD  personnel  as  official  speakers  or  panel members  at  international  trade  exhibition.    However,  direct  DoD  participation  does  not include DoD employees who attend international trade shows and exhibitions as observers or in  other  capacities  not  directly  related  to  the  transportation,  display,  demonstration,  or manning of defense equipment. 2.20.  Marketing Guidelines. 2.20.1.  It  is  important  to  note  and  remember  that  the  oral,  visual,  or  other  disclosure  of information  or  data  regarding  certain  technologies  or  end-items  to  any  foreign  person, embassy,  agency,  or  subdivision  of  a  foreign  government  (for  example,  its  diplomatic mission)  may  constitute  an  export  under  the  AECA  or  the  International  Traffic  in  Arms Regulation  (ITAR),  requiring  an  approved  export  license  or  exemption.    Severe  penalties exist  for  the  unauthorized  export  of  technology  or  related  data,  information,  or  end-items.  There  are  five  situations  in  which  AF  personnel  should  exercise  special  caution  in discussions with potential or actual partners, as listed below. 2.20.1.1.  AF personnel cannot promote new sales to partners in new areas.  If a partner has  not  purchased  a  system  and  has  not  asked  for  information  concerning  that  system, USG  representatives  should  not  initiate  discussions  concerning  the  system,  depot capabilities, etc. 2.20.1.2.  Representatives from the DoD must not give the impression that they have the authority to decide whether a sale will take place.  The AECA gives the State Department the  authority  to  approve  all  sales  of  defense  articles  and  services  to  foreign  countries.  DoD 5105.38-M defines the SCO as "the principal  point of contact  (POC) for most US defense  industry  representatives  marketing  defense  equipment  in  US  missions."    Any USG  entity  wishing  to  discuss  available  services  and  capabilities  with  other  countries should do so through the SCO.  This allows the SCO to guard against false expectations that the USG is prepared to sell items being discussed. from to 2.20.1.3.  Representatives favor  one  US competitor/product  over  another  US  competitor/product.    Representatives  must  limit themselves  to  factual  descriptions  of  systems  and  system  capabilities  without  appearing to  endorse  one  US  system  over  a  competitive  US  system.    This  is  not  to  inhibit endorsement of US products or capabilities over foreign products or capabilities. the  DoD  cannot  appear 2.20.1.4.  DoD  personnel  may  encourage  foreign  governments  to  purchase  US  defense-related  products  when  such  sales  are  consistent  with  US  national  security  and  foreign policy  interests,  and  the  products  have  been  authorized  by  the  USG  for  international marketing or export. 2.20.1.5.  When a partner has acquired a US defense product, DoD personnel can discuss potential  follow-on  support  and  maintenance  requirements  with  partner  representatives.  This  provision  includes  improvements  in  product  capabilities  that  the  AF  is  pursuing, planning, or has fielded. 2.21.  Negotiating Guidelines.   32  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 2.21.1.  DoDD  5530.3,  International  Agreements,  as implemented  by  AFI  51-701, Negotiating,  Concluding,  Reporting,  and  Maintaining  International  Agreements,  contains procedures for negotiating and concluding (signing) international agreements. 2.21.1.1.  DoD  personnel  shall  neither  initiate  nor  conduct  the  negotiation  of  an international agreement without prior written approval by the DoD officer assigned with approval responsibility in DoDD 5530.3. 2.21.1.2.  The  Director,  DSCA  has  the  delegated  authority  to  negotiate  and  conclude agreements involving security assistance. (including their  agencies, 2.21.1.3.  An  international  agreement  is  any  agreement  concluded  with  one  or  more foreign  governments instrumentalities,  or  political subdivisions), or with an international organization, that (1) is signed or agreed to by any DoD component, (2) signifies the intention of the parties to be bound in international law, and (3) is denominated as an Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Memorandum of Agreement  (MOA),  LOA,  memorandum  of  arrangements,  exchange  of  notes,  exchange of  letters,  technical  arrangement,  protocol,  verbal  note,  aide  memoir,  agreed  minute, contract, arrangement, statement of intent, letter of intent, statement of understanding, or any other name connoting a similar legal consequence. 2.21.1.4.  Negotiation is the communication by any means of a position or offer on behalf of  the  AF  to  a  foreign  government  in  such  detail,  that  acceptance  would  result  in  an international agreement.  Providing a draft agreement is considered negotiating, however, negotiation  does  not  include  preliminary  or  exploratory  discussions  or  routine  meetings where  no  draft  documents  are  discussed,  so  long  as  such  discussions  or  meetings  are conducted with the understanding that the views communicated do not and will not bind or commit any side, legally or otherwise. 2.21.2.  For  security  assistance  matters,  appropriate  authority  must  be  obtained  before engaging in negotiations that may commit the AF to new sales or leases of defense articles and services.  Prior approval is not required for initial, informal, or exploratory discussions in which  the  AF  provides  information  regarding  systems,  facilities,  and  capabilities  already approved for release.  Prior approval  also is not  needed for talks about potential training or sustainment  support  for  existing  sales  or  leases.    In  some  cases,  the  requirement  for  prior approval  is  met  through  the  normal  processes  for  case  development,  disclosure  clearances, licensing, etc. 2.22.  AF-Sponsored  Exercises,  Competitions,  Evaluations  and  Foreign  Unit  Deployments to USAF Units. 2.22.1.  The  following  guidance  pertains  to  AF-sponsored  exercises  (e.g.,  Red  Flag,  Green Flag, Angel Thunder, and AMC Rodeo) within CONUS and Alaska/Hawaii.  This guidance does  not  address  Joint  Chief  of  Staff  (JCS)  or  Allied  (Allied  or  joint  US/Allied)  sponsored events outside US-controlled air space.  Unless otherwise identified in other exercise-specific guidance  (e.g.,  policy  memos  or  AFIs),  the  following  general  international  participation guidance/responsibilities apply:   AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   33  2.22.2.

MAJCOMs.    MAJCOMs  are  responsible  for  both  MAJCOM  and  unit  level exercises  sponsored/hosted  within  their  AOR.    Note:    Although  not  a  MAJCOM,  the National  Guard  Bureau’s  (NGB)  J53/IA  organization  serves  this  role.    Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: 2.22.3.1.  Providing  a  list/description  of  existing/planned  exercises  with  international participation, along with MAJCOM exercise focal points, to Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force/International Affairs, Security Assistance Policy and International Training &  Education  Division  (SAF/IAPX).    Note:    MAJCOM  international  affairs/security cooperation  offices  should  also  have  complete  visibility  over  all  MAJCOM-sponsored exercises. 2.22.3.2.  Identifying  MAJCOM  goals/objectives  for  international  participation  (e.g., specific or general international partners that should be invited).  MAJCOMs may request SAF/IA prioritization of international partners that meet MAJCOM stated exercise goals. (e.g.,  English 2.22.3.3.

Ensuring  international  partner  participation  is  conducted  IAW  appropriate guidance  (FMS  case)  and/or  applicable  international  agreements.    MAJCOM/units provide CM with pricing information, as needed, to develop required FMS cases. 2.22.3.7.  Ensuring  international  partners  adhere  to  United  States  Air  Force  (USAF) operational  control  and  flight  safety  procedures/requirements.    MAJCOMs/units  must publish specific exercise procedures for ensuring the complete spectrum of international partner  participation  is  accounted  for  (e.g.,  operational  control,  flight  safety,  and  range management) 2.22.4.  Air  Force  Security  Assistance  Center  (AFSAC).    AFSAC  is  responsible  for developing  LOAs  and  managing  FMS  cases  supporting  international  partner  exercise participation. 2.22.4.1.  Acts  as  the  implementing  agency  for  international  partner  exercise  support LORs.    AFSAC  develops  LOAs  (working  with  MAJCOM  exercise  focal  points)  to recoup  all  FMS  costs  associated  with  international  air  force  participation  in  USAF-sponsored  exercises,  competitions,  evaluations  and  deployments.    FMS  cases  written  to support international participation in such activities are N or Q cases. 2.22.4.2.  AFSAC may use blanket order cases/lines to support international partners who do  not  wish  to  have  a  new  LOA  for  every  exercise.    The  LOR  from  the  partner  must specify the specific exercises(s) in which participation is anticipated.  The LOR should be received to allow case implementation no later than 120 days prior to the initial planning conference (IPC) of the first exercise, or actual exercise start date if not attending an IPC. 2.22.5.  International  Partner  Requests  for  Flying  Training  Deployments  and  Flight Exercises  (Outside  of  AF-Sponsored  Exercises).    The  following  guidance  outlines procedures  for  staffing  international  partner  requests  (self-invited  vs.  USAF-sponsored events)  for  flying  unit  training/flight  exercises  involving  USAF  support,  bases,  or  ranges within  CONUS  and  Alaska/Hawaii.    Unlike  AF-sponsored  exercises,  where  USAF (MAJCOM/units) exercise sponsors invite international partners to participate, these staffing procedures  support  a  formal  process  which  forwards  international  partner  requests  to MAJCOMs for support consideration.  Staffing procedures are: 2.22.5.1.  International  partner  submits  a  formal  Letter  of  Request  (LOR)    requesting USAF support--goal is to have LOR no later than (NLT) nine months prior to proposed deployment date. 2.22.5.2.  Request  should  include  information  listed  in  Table  2.2.  (although  additional information/clarification may be required to properly evaluate a request). 2.22.5.3.  SAF/IA Country Director will coordinate request at minimum with SAF/IAPX, SAF/IAPD,  the  Office  of  the  Air  Force  General  Counsel,  International  Affairs   36  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 (SAF/GCI), NGB, and AFSAC, as well as the MAJCOM impacted.

It is critical they have the  opportunity their  operations, concurring/non-concurring as they deem appropriate staff/evaluate fully to requests impacting 2.22.5.4.  After proper coordination, the AFSAC drafts/coordinates a formal response to the LOR.  The response will include appropriate provisos which surfaced during staffing, as  well  as  an  estimated  timeline  for  FMS  case  development  and/or  implementation  of other appropriate documentation. 2.22.5.5.  AFSAC develops the supporting FMS LOA.                       AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   37  Table 2.2.

Security  Assistance  Survey  Teams  (Section  26  of  the  Arms  Export  Control  Act (AECA)). (USG)  personnel,  partner 3.1.1.  Teams  consisting  of  United  States  Government representatives,  and  commercial  contractors  conduct  in-country  surveys  at  the  partner’s request.   A  comprehensive survey of a partner’s  military capabilities may be requested any time a new program is initiated in order to develop a program baseline.  More often, surveys are conducted in the context of ongoing programs to address specific needs.  DoD 5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM), Chapter 1, provides general guidance for survey teams. 3.2.  Types of Surveys. 3.2.1.  Site  Survey.    A  site  survey  focuses  on  the  proposed  physical  location  for  a  new system.    It  addresses  a  wide  range  of  issues  concerning  the  supportability  of  the  system, facility requirements, infrastructure support, etc. 3.2.2.  Training  Survey.    A  training  survey  addresses  a  partner-specific  training  needs  and training conditions.  Training survey teams may evaluate generic training requirements (such as basic flight training), or more specific training needs for a particular equipment installation and its associated mission. 3.2.3.  Logistics  Survey.    A  logistics  survey  concentrates  on  the  support  requirements  of  a system, equipment, or capability. 3.2.4.  Technical  Survey.    A  technical  survey  evaluates  a  partner’s  need  for  technical assistance or system modifications (e.g., engineering change proposal (ECP)). 3.3.  Roles and Responsibilities. 3.3.1.  A  site  survey  is  normally  required  when  a  purchaser  is  new  to  United  States  (US) support  or  is  acquiring  a  new  system.    The  site  survey  should  be  performed  as  early  as possible, because site conditions vary considerably around the world and can have significant impact  on  system  supportability  and  cost.    Specialized  teams  may  be  formed  to  conduct  a training, logistical, or technical survey. 3.3.2.  The Case Manager (CM) must reflect the site survey results in the subsequent  Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA). 3.3.3.  All costs for the site survey must be recouped in an LOA. 3.3.4.  The  site  survey  team  (SST)  will  prepare  a  report  and  brief  the  partner.    Physical, logistical,  and  informational  security  requirements  of  the  system  will  be  included  in  the report. In-country team and SST will determine the applicability of the existing host partner agreements (logistics support agreements and acquisition and cross-servicing agreements). 3.3.5.  The  site  survey  team  chief  is  normally  from  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air Force/International  Affairs  (SAF/IA);  however  SAF/IA  may  delegate  this  responsibility.  Contractors may be included as associate team members under the control of the team chief. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   39  3.4.  Congressional Interest. 3.4.1.  Congress  requires  a  quarterly  summary  report  (Records  Control  Symbol  (RCS):  Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) (Q) 1137, Security Assistance Surveys) on all security assistance surveys authorized or conducted during the previous quarter.  The report is due to DSCA no later than 30 days after the end of the reporting quarter. 3.5.  System Planning Team (SPT). 3.5.1.  SAF/IA  may  set  up  a  system  planning  team  (SPT)  for  major  systems  still  under development when a potential foreign military sale (FMS) can have a direct impact on an Air Force (AF) program.  Costs for the SPT must be covered by a line item in an LOA. 3.5.2.  The  SPT  consists  of  one  or  more  representatives  from  AF  organizations  involved  in the system development  program and sale.  Organizations represented may include SAF/IA (as team chief), Assistant Secretary of the Air Force/Acquisition, Deputy Assistant Secretary for  Contracting  (SAF/AQC),  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force/Acquisition,  Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Integration (SAF/AQX), Deputy Chief of Staff/Logistics, Installations  &  Mission  Support  (AF/A4),  Air  Force  Materiel  Command  (AFMC),  Air Combat  Command  (ACC),  Air  Education  and  Training  Command  (AETC),  the  program offices,  Air  Force  Security  Assistance  Center  (AFSAC),  Air  Force  Security  Assistance Training  (Squadron)  (AFSAT),  an  appropriate  representative  from  the  Mission  Area Directorate, and the major command (MAJCOM) system users.  The team includes experts in all  functional  areas  to  be  surveyed,  including  systems,  operations,  maintenance,  facilities, logistics, supply, transportation, training, cultural, linguistic, and other areas as required.  If the program office concludes that contractors are needed and SAF/IA approves, contractors may be included as associate team members under the control of the team chief. 3.5.3.  The  SPT  must  consider  both  the  AF’s  and  the  partner’s  needs  in  surveying  the following areas: 3.5.3.1.  Acquisition and FMS procedures and the effect on AF development. 3.5.3.2.  Initial  and  sustainment  spares,  support  equipment,  maintenance,  aircrew  or maintenance training and equipment, etc. 3.5.3.3.  Procurement lead-time. 3.5.3.4.  Financing. 3.5.3.5.  International Engine Management Program (IEMP), Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP), and Technical Coordination Program (TCP). 3.5.3.6.  Packing,  preservation,  transportation,  licensing,  embedded  information  security (INFOSEC), and test, measurement and diagnostic equipment (TMDE). 3.5.4.  The  SPT  report  should  include  all  items  in  the  Site  Survey  Team  report,  plus considerations unique to the SPT (e.g., effect on the AF programs).   40  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 Chapter 4 PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS) CASES 4.1.  Types of FMS Cases. 4.1.1.  There  are  three  basic  types  of  cases:  defined  order,  blanket  order,  and  cooperative logistics supply support arrangement (CLSSA).  A complete listing of case types (to be used as  the  first  position  of  a  case  designator)  and  the  responsible  organization  for  development and  management  of  those  cases  can  be  found  in  Attachment  3.    These  cases  may  include articles from production, Air Force (AF) inventory, or excess stores of the AF or Department of  Defense  (DoD).    Services  may  be  procured,  organic  (DoD  services/stock)  or  a combination  of  both.    Letters  of  Request  (LORs)  submitted  by  countries  will  identify  the requirement only, not the specific case category to be used to support the requirement.  The Case  Manager  (CM)  will  determine  the  appropriate  case  category  to  be  used  in  supporting each  requirement.    The  AF  established  a  goal  of  transmitting  85  percent  of  Letters  of Acceptance (LOAs) and LOA Amendments to the partner on or before the Anticipated Offer Date (AOD). 4.1.1.1.  The AODs for foreign military sales (FMS) case documents are as follows: 4.1.1.1.1.  Blanket order LOAs, training LOAs, CLSSAs and associated amendments and modifications will have an AOD of no longer than 75 days following the date the LOR  is  shown  as  complete  in  Defense  Security  Assistance  Management  System (DSAMS). 4.1.1.1.2.  Defined  order  LOAs  and  associated  amendments  and  modifications  will have  an  AOD  no  longer  than  120  days  following  the  date  the  LOR  is  shown  as complete in DSAMS. 4.1.1.1.3.  Defined  order  LOAs  and  associated  amendments  that  are  unique  to  the partner may have an AOD that is longer than 120 days following the date the LOR is shown as complete in  DSAMS.  The AOD will be determined by the implementing agency and CM due to the unique characteristics of the case. 4.1.1.1.4.  All  Pseudo  LOAs  and  associated  amendments  and  modifications  will  be assigned  an  AOD  as  soon  as  sufficient  information  is  available  to  determine  an appropriate AOD. 4.1.2.  The  AF  provides  initial  and  long-term,  follow-on  sustainment  support  covering  the full  range  of  logistics  (including  support  equipment,  spares,  repair  parts,  maintenance, engineering, technical assistance, acquisition data, and transportation) and training.  In order to provide a timely LOA, the meaning of each type of case has been clarified to facilitate the process of what type of LOA document to prepare (for further guidance see DoD 5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM), Chapter 6.). 4.1.3.  System  Sales  Cases.  System sales cases  implement  the total  package  approach and include  major  end-items  plus  all  articles  and  services  necessary  for  delivery  and  initial support.  System sales cases provide aircraft; missiles; command & control, communication, computer,  and  intelligence  (C4I)  systems;  radar;  and  complex  services.    All  training  under system  sales  cases  will  be  identified  under  a  training  Military  Articles  and  Services  List AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   41  (MASL) and will be managed by Air Force Security Assistance Training (AFSAT) Squadron to  ensure  all  congressional  reporting  and  student  screening  requirements  are  met  in accordance with United States (US) law and DoD guidance. 4.1.3.1.  The scope of a system sale may have different meanings to different purchasers, and the needs of a purchaser for items and support in a system may vary. 4.1.3.2.  The  purchaser  is  encouraged  to  participate  in  discussions,  including  those pertaining to the development of the LOA. 4.1.3.3.  The  scope  of  a  system  sales  case  should  be  limited  to  articles,  services  and training required for initial activation. 4.1.3.4.  Initial  support  for  a  system  sales  case  will  include  the  articles  and  services necessary to ensure a fully activated system.  The initial activation period normally ends with  the  delivery  of  the  last  major  end  item;  however,  the  activation  period  may  be extended until all essential articles and services are in place to support full activation. 4.1.3.5.  The applicable DSAMS notes associated with a system sales case must state that long-term, follow-on sustainment support and training are not part of the LOA.  A note must  be  included  to  state  that  the  purchaser  agrees  to  negotiate  for  sustainment  spares through AFSAC under CLSSA, if the AF is to provide the support.  If the LOA contains no provision for initial support, this fact must be documented in the LOA.  An estimate must  be  provided  to  the  purchaser  identifying  the  scope  and  period  of  recommended sustainment after initial system activation.  The estimate should be for a period of 12 to 24 months depending on the requirements of the purchaser. 4.1.3.6.  ―Other  Services‖  lines  are  limited  to  a  period  not  to  exceed  eighteen  months after  full  system  activation,  unless  otherwise  approved  in  writing  through  appropriate channels to SAF/IAPX. 4.1.4.  Sustainment  Cases.    Sustainment  cases  provide  articles  and  services  necessary  to support  a  system  after  completion  of  system  activation.    These  cases  provide  support equipment,  spares,  technical  publications,  technical  services,  maintenance,  ammunition, training etc.  Sustainment may be defined order (identified quantities or services) or blanket order  (defined  by  dollar  value  alone).    Systems  sales  and  training  cases  provide  letter designations for cases, but sustainment cases do not perform this function. 4.1.4.1.  The CM and the SAPM must ensure that  the purchaser is  aware of the need to have sustainment  cases in place to  avoid  lapses in  AF support.   In some  extreme cases, sustainment may be provided through an initial system sale; however, a waiver must be obtained through the appropriate security assistance policy office. 4.1.5.  Training  Cases.    Training  cases  cover  all  types  of  training,  formal  and  informal courses, on-the-job training (OJT), familiarization or qualification training, aircrew training, professional  training,  mobile  training  teams  (MTT),  engineering  technical  services  (ETS), Technical  Assistance  Field  Teams  (TAFT),  extended  training  services  specialists  (ETSS), Language Training Detachments (LTD), and other technical or specialist training from both the  US  government  (USG)  and  contractor  sources.    Dedicated  training  programs,  which include multiple command requirements related to training, will be written and managed by AFSAT in coordination with the applicable major command (MAJCOM) responsible for the   42  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 base on which the dedicated training program is located.  Due to US law which requires the DoD to report international training and security screening of international students prior to receiving  DoD  or  DoD  sponsored  training,  all  international  student  training  must  be conducted under a training line managed by AFSAT. 4.1.5.1.  AFSAT  will  prepare  training  cases,  including  cases  for  dedicated  training squadrons. 4.1.5.2.  In  addition,  AFSAT  will  provide  all  LOA  data  (LOAD)  for  training  to  support systems sales cases. 4.1.5.3.  Training  will  not  be  embedded  in  non-training  lines  unless  a  waiver  to  include training is approved by the AFSAT Commander. 4.1.6.  Pseudo Cases.  Various authorities within US law allow using US appropriated funds, other than foreign military financing program  (FMFP) and  IMET funds, to  provide defense articles  and  services  to  friendly  partners  and  allies.    These  usually  are  supplemental  DoD appropriations used to provide equipment, supplies and training to foreign military forces to conduct joint operations with US forces and to conduct counternarcotics and counterterrorist operations.    DoD  and  other  federal  agencies  will  submit  a  request  to  Defense  Security Cooperation  Agency  (DSCA)  identifying  the  services  and  equipment  to  be  provided  and citing  the  legal  authority  for  the  program.    DSCA  will  approve  the  use  of  the  FMS infrastructure  to  execute  the  program.    A  Pseudo-LOA  will  be  prepared  by  the  Air  Force Security  Assistance  Center  (AFSAC)  and  will  itemize  defense  articles  and/or  services included in the request and will be used by the USG to track the sale. 4.2.  LOA Lifecycle Quality Control. 4.2.1.  The  quality,  accuracy,  and  timeliness  of  all  finished  products  begin  with  the  initial review of the LOR and continue through to the AF’s proposal to DSCA for countersignature.  Quality control of documents is the highest priority during the preparation and processing of all sales, whether for spares, technical orders, training, or major weapons systems. 4.2.2.  All LOA documents are legal instruments between the USG and our foreign partners.  As such, they should be treated and developed with the utmost dedication and detail.  Failure to  provide  partners  with  accurate  and  timely  data  may  result  in  schedule  delays,  cost overruns, and less-than-optimal performance. 4.2.3.  To  ensure  that  documents  are  of  the  highest  quality,  preparation  and  review  is conducted by organizations within the AF (AFSAC and AFSAT) and other outside agencies (e.g.,  National  Security  Agency  (NSA)).    DSCA  will  review  and  countersign  all  LOA documents. 4.2.4.  DoD  5105.38-M  gives  general  instructions  for  preparing  LOAs.    Each  activity  that prepares  documents  must  issue  detailed  preparation  guidance  ensuring  maximum  possible standardization.    All  requests  for  waiver  to  guidance  in  this  manual  or  to  those  in  DoD 5105.38-M  must  be  approved  by  or  through  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air Force/International  Affairs,  Security  Assistance  Policy  and  International  Training  & Education Division (SAF/IAPX).  AF LOAs will be prepared in accordance with (IAW) the DoD 5105.38-M prescribed format using DSAMS. 4.3.  Initiating and Validating FMS Requests. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   43  4.3.1.  Partners  initiate  FMS  cases  by  communicating  their  interest  in  defense  articles  or services by submitting an LOR.  When validating an LOR, ensure the following: 4.3.1.1.  An eligible partner must forward a request through channels as described in DoD 5105.38-M.    Requests  from  an  ineligible  partner  will  be  forwarded  to  DSCA  for appropriate action. 4.3.1.2.  The  preponderance  of  articles  or  services  in  the  request  must  be  under  AF control or in support of an initial system acquisition.  The partner will submit requests for articles  and  services  under  Army,  Navy,  or  other  DoD  component  control  to  the appropriate activity. 4.3.1.3.  Requests  for  nonstandard  articles  or  services  that  DSCA  has  not  approved  or directed  for  sale  will  be  sent  through  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air Force/International Affairs (SAF/IA) Country Director to DSCA for approval. 4.3.1.4.  Requested articles or services must be authorized for sale according to National Disclosure Policy (NDP) (see AFPD 16-2, Disclosure of Military Information to Foreign Governments  and  International  Organizations,  and  AFI  16-201,  Air  Force  Foreign Disclosure and Technology Program). 4.3.1.5.  LOR  validation  date  will  be  on  the  case  identification  page  of  the  Manpower Requirements  Package  (MRP)  in  the  Security  Assistance  Manpower  Requirements System (SAMRS).  The LOR validation date is used to measure the LOA response. 4.3.1.6.  When  funding  pre-LOR  activities  such  as  site  surveys,  logistics  support conferences,  and  case  planning  meetings,  which  are  necessary  in  order  to  definitize purchaser requirements prior to a request for an LOA, a funding threshold will apply (see DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 5 for requirements). 4.3.2.  Send  partner  request  for  articles  and  services  not  authorized  for  sale  under  current NDP guidelines to the appropriate SAF/IA Country Director who in turn will coordinate with the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force/International  Affairs,  Foreign  Disclosure, Weapons  and  Technology  Transfer  Division  (SAF/IAPD)  to  determine  release.    LOR validation will be complete no later than 20 days from receipt. 4.3.3.  If an exception to NDP is required, the SAF/IA Country Director in conjunction with the  in-country  Security  Cooperation  Officer  (SCO)  and  Regional  Combatant  Commander, will: 4.3.3.1.  Develop the appropriate political-military (pol-mil) justification. 4.3.3.2.  Request  DSCA  to  coordinate  the  justification  with  the  Office  of  the  Assistant Secretary of Defense, International Security Affairs (OASD/ISA), Secretary of State, and the White House, as appropriate. 4.3.3.3.  Provide  SAF/IAPD  with  the  necessary  justification  for  processing  the  NDP exception.  If the AF does not recommend release, SAF/IAPD will forward the request to DSCA for final action. 4.3.3.4.  Return request for articles or services restricted from sale by statute or guidance to the requester; explain the restrictions and indicate that exceptions should be requested through DSCA.   44  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 4.3.3.5.  Make  sure  the  request  includes  all  data  required  by  DoD  5105.38-M.    Hold incomplete requests, and send a letter or a message to the requester asking for the missing data. 4.3.3.6.  In all instances, notify the requester of action taken and indicate if the action will cause delay. 4.4.  Processing Valid FMS Requests. 4.4.1.  Requests that meet all requirements in Section 4.3 of this document must be processed using the following procedures.  This section does not apply to P&A data requests for spares or equipment, or for repair or overhaul of repairable items on cases already established, such as  blanket  order  cases.    Procedures  for  those  materiel  and/or  services  are  addressed  under AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 9. 4.4.2.  P&A Data Requests. 4.4.2.1.  Countries who request P&A data must state that the information is for planning purposes only.  The request for P&A data should be sent directly to the appropriate case writing  organization  (AFSAC  or  AFSAT).    The  case  authoring  organization  should ensure the defense articles and services requested by the purchaser have been determined to be releasable by the appropriate foreign disclosure office (FDO). 4.4.2.2.  P&A data will be formulated using available information, including standard AF factors and formulas.  P&A responses should be developed from historical P&A or LOA data.  Request for P&A data will be tasked through DSAMS.  LORs for P&A data should be  entered  as  a  partner  request  in  DSAMS.    P&A  data  responses  will  be  loaded  into DSAMS and provided to the purchaser in the form of a DSAMS planning case Response Document.  P&A data should be limited to 7-9 line items. 4.4.2.3.  P&A data is for planning purposes only and should not be used for the partner’s budget  programming  or  used  for  preparing  an  LOA.    The  following  disclaimer  clause must be included when furnishing P&A data to the requesting partner: 4.4.2.3.1.  ―The Price and Availability (P&A) data provided are not valid for purposes of  preparing  a  Letter  of  Offer  and  Acceptance  (LOA)  and  may  not  be  adequate  for budgetary  purposes.    These  data  are  for  planning/review  purposes  only,  to  assist  in your  Government’s  determination  whether  or  not  to  request  an  LOA.    If  [insert  the appropriate  foreign  partner]  is  interested  in  pursuing  this  potential  purchase,  it  must request an LOA.‖ (DoD Manual 5105.38-M, Chapter 5). 4.4.2.4.  P&A  data  should  be  provided  to  the  partner  within  45  days  of  receipt  of  the LOR.  The program office will provide P&A to the CCM, and AFSAC will provide P&A to the partner under most circumstances. 4.4.2.5.  P&A  for  Global  Positioning  System/Precise  Position  System  (GPS/PPS) equipment  must  be  coordinated  through  the  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  Wing (GPSW/GPUF) located at Los Angeles AFB, CA.  This office is the sole program office that manages all GPS equipment and security devices purchased through FMS.  The GPS Wing  ensures  compliance  with  DoD  GPS  security  policy  and  that  partners  obtain  the correct GPS equipment for their weapon system platforms. 4.4.3.  LOA Requests. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   45  4.4.3.1.  For an LOA request, the CCM initiates the case in DSAMS.  The initial DSAMS input  will  contain  the  required  information  in  accordance  with  DoD  5105.38-M  and  as described herein. 4.4.3.2.  Concurrent  requests  from  the  same  partner  for  the  same  type  of  articles  or services  may  be  combined  into  one  case;  there  is  no  requirement  for  an  LOA  for  each individual LOR. 4.4.3.3.  Procedures have been approved that allow North American Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and Australia to purchase via direct commercial sale (DCS) Selective Anti Availability Spoofing Module (SAASM) GPS equipment.  US vendors must request a Section 30 sales agreement in accordance with the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) for loading operational  software  and initialization parameters onto  the SAASM security devices being sold via DCS. 4.4.4.  Identifying  FMS  Cases.  Upon initialization of a new FMS case in DSAMS, a case identifier  is  assigned  to  the  case.    This  identifier  is  comprised  of  three  major  components:  country-code  (e.g.,  ―BN‖),  Implementing  Agency  code  (the  most  common  are  B-Army,  D-Air Force, and P-Navy), and a three-position case designator (e.g., ―AAA‖). 4.4.4.1.  The  first  position  of  the  three-position  case  designator  identifies  the  article  or service being provided (see Attachment 3).  The remaining two positions are sequentially assigned by DSAMS and are used to distinguish among a country’s separate cases for the same  category  of  item  or  service.    DoD  Manual  5105.38-M,  further  discusses  building case identifiers and designators. 4.4.4.2.  A project nickname may be assigned to system sales, classified requests, and/or complex cases.  SAF/IA Country Directors will obtain nicknames as appropriate from the Office  of  the  Administrative  Assistant  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  force,  Directorate  of Security, Counter Intelligence and Special Programs (SAF/AAZ). 4.4.5.  Identifying  Classified  FMS  Cases.    When  a  CCM  receives  a  request  for  an  LOA, which  will  be  classified  under  DoD  5105.38-M,  the  CCM  will  initialize  an  unclassified pseudo-case  in  DSAMS.    Pseudo-codes  will  be  obtained  from  the  appropriate  document preparation  sections  for  use  by  each  organization.    The  LOR  must  provide  explicit instructions and designations as to what is and is not classified.  If the partner has not clearly distinguished  classified  from  unclassified  information,  the  LOR  should  be  returned immediately with appropriate instructions.  Additionally, the LOR must provide justification for  processing  a  classified  case.    The  AF  will  not  process  an  LOA  in  which  all  data  is identified as classified or without sufficient justification for a classified case. 4.4.6.  LOAs  which  meet  Section  36(b)(1)  of  the  AECA  thresholds  must  be  notified  to Congress  (see  paragraph  4.4.6.1.).  The  CCM  will  provide  the  required  information  to DSCA which will assemble the package and submit it to Congress.  During this notification process,  the  official  and  draft-official  USG  responses  (LOAs,  Congressional  Notification (CN)  or  NRC  Waivers)  can  be  considered  CLASSIFED  when  the  combinations  of  data (country  name,  system,  and  quantity  or  value)  are  included.    When  developing  the  case  in DSAMS, prior to CN, use the masked/pseudo case identifier to protect the system’s integrity.  Mentioning  the  country  name  together  with  the  system  and  quantity  or  dollar  value,  as contents  of  a  pending  CN,  in  any  of  our  working  document,  including  routine  NIPR  email   46  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 traffic  is  NOT  CLASSIFIED  at  any  time.    A  CN  checklist  will  be  included  in  the  CN package  when  requesting  coordination.    DoD  Manual  5105.38-M  provides  the  details associated with the CN process. 4.4.6.1.  Thresholds.  NATO countries, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea: 4.4.6.1.1.  $25 million or more for MDE items 4.4.6.1.2.  $100 million or more of Total Case Value 4.4.6.1.3.  $300 million or more of Design or Construction Services 4.4.6.2.  Thresholds.  All other countries: 4.4.6.2.1.  $14 million or more for MDE items 4.4.6.2.2.  $50 million or more of Total Case Value 4.4.6.2.3.  $200 million or more of Design or Construction Services 4.5.  Preparing Letter of Offer and Acceptance Data (LOAD). 4.5.1.  The purpose of  LOAD is  to  give the partner the best  available  estimate of costs  and delivery times.  LOAD is valid for use on an LOA. 4.5.2.  LOAD Characteristics.  LOAD will include line item descriptions, estimated delivery schedules, program milestones, payment schedules (to include expenditure profiles from the major contractors), and manpower and all associated cost required to execute the case. 4.5.2.1.  LOAD pricing should include a valid expiration date. 4.5.2.2.  Detailed  LOAD  studies  are  not  done  for  AFmanaged  spare  parts,  Defense Logistics  Agency  (DLA)  and  General  Services  Administration  (GSA)  items,  or  for blanket order cases. The LOAD will always be released in LOA format.  Any deviation requires written approval from the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force/International Affairs,  Security  Assistance  Policy  and  International  Training  &  Education  Division (SAF/IAPX). 4.5.3.  LOAD Taskings. 4.5.3.1.  The  responsible  security  assistance  manager  will  validate  LORs  to  ensure  that information is sufficient  to develop valid and accurate LOAD estimates.  If information provided by the partner is not adequate for preparing quality LOAD, the partner will be requested to provide additional information. 4.5.3.2.  LORs  for  major  system  acquisition  cases  will  be  coordinated  by  the  SAF/IA Country Director involving the teaming process and the cognizant Assistant Secretary of the Air Force/Acquisition (SAF/AQ) mission area directorate prior to the CCM sending the request  to  the Security Assistance Program  Manager  (SAPM) for pricing.  SAF/AQ will  provide  copies  of  the  request  to  the  appropriate  AF  Program  Execution  Officer (AFPEO) or Designated Acquisition Official (DAO). 4.5.3.3.  The  designated  SAPM  is  responsible  for  coordination  of  the  preparation  of LOAD, in conjunction with the CM and Line Managers.  DSAMS is the required method for  gathering  LOAD.    If  Line  Managers  lack  access  to  DSAMS,  the  SAPM  should AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   47  contact  the  CM  for  resolution.    Contractors  may  help  prepare  LOAD  when  required  in accordance with the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). 4.5.3.4.  Replies  to  LOAD  tasking  should  be  completed  no  later  than  the  due  date assigned  on  the  tasking.    The  tasking  due  date  is  approximately  one  fourth  of  the  time between the date of the task and AOD.  If an LOAD tasking cannot be completed within the prescribed time period, as described above, the LOAD preparing office must request a new suspense from the CM and justify the delay.  LOAD extensions will be requested in advance and will be approved by the appropriate CCM.  If the requested LOAD response is  less than specified above, the CM must  state the date the information  is required and justify the urgency. 4.5.4.  General  LOAD  Requirements.    The  SAPM  must  ensure  that  the  following information (as appropriate) is included in the LOAD package: 4.5.4.1.  Identification  of  dangerous,  hazardous,  classified  and  unclassified,  distribution-limited,  outsized  air  cargo,  and  information  security  (INFOSEC)  system  items.    The LOAD requester must be told of all INFOSEC items not identified in the LOAD request.  Foreign  Disclosure  System  (FDS)  reports  must  be  made  for  all  LOAD  requests  on classified and non-releasable articles or services. 4.5.4.2.  Identification of potential problems, such as starting up closed production lines, diverting  items  from  AF  inventory,  nonstandard  items  and  non-availability  of  followon support. 4.5.4.3.  Identification  of  Joint  Staff  and  AF  controlled  items  ("AF"  in  the  Catalog Management  Data  File  issue  and  fund  control  column,  indicates  that  the  item  is  AF controlled). 4.5.4.4.  Availability  of  USG  personnel  --  both  those  who  will  be  on  temporary  duty (TDY) travel and those who will be assigned under permanent change of station (PCS). 4.5.4.5.  Availability  of  contract  personnel  in  place  of  USG  employees,  civilian  and military, for any service overseas. 4.5.4.6.  Deviations or waivers required. 4.5.4.7.  Interim contractor support (ICS) needs. 4.5.4.8.  Source  information  for  commercial  and  commercially  available  articles  and services.    Also  identify  any  articles  or  services  approved  by  DSCA  for  contractor preference for DCS. 4.5.4.9.  Federal equipment condition code if the equipment is in long supply or excess. 4.5.4.10.  Training requirements and costs. 4.5.4.11.  Travel  requirements  and  costs.    Travel  costs  must  be  estimated  using Attachment 4 as a guide. 4.5.4.12.  Security access requirements for personnel in the program. 4.5.4.13.  Site survey team (SST) and system planning team requirements.   48  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 4.5.4.14.  Generic  code,  MASL  identifier,  and  major  defense  equipment  (MDE)  code.  For further information on MASLs and MDE Codes see the following publications:  Title 22,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations,  Parts  120-130,  ―International  Traffic  in  Arms Regulations  (ITAR)‖;  DSCA  Handbook  7003;  DoD  7000.14-R,  DoD  Financial Management  Regulations  (FMRs),  Volume  15,  Security  Assistance  Policy  and Procedures, Chapter 7; and Appendix 4 of the DoD 5105.38-M. 4.5.4.15.  Date through which data is valid. 4.5.4.16.  FMS  Management  Plan.    In  addition  to  submitting  LOAD,  the  designated agency must prepare a draft FMS Management Plan (Attachment 2) for all system sales cases  and  send  copies  to  the  CM.    Note:    A  Life  Cycle  Management  Plan  (LCMP) developed  in  accordance  with  overarching  DoD  and  US  Air  Force  (USAF)  acquisition guidance  and  procedures  can  suffice/satisfy  the  requirement  for  an  FMS  Management Plan. 4.5.4.17.  Lines Containing Manpower.  AFSAC and AFSAT will provide documentation for  lines  containing  manpower  to  SAF/IAPX  and  must  receive  approval  prior  to presenting  LOA for military  department  (MILDEP) signature.  See Section 4.6.  of this manual for documentation guidance for manpower requirements.  The Manpower Travel Data  Sheet  (MTDS)/SAMRS  package  must  be  approved  prior  to  Defense  Security Cooperation Agency, Operations Directorate, Case Writing Division (DSCA/OPS/CWD) submission. 4.5.4.18.  Each  LOA  document  includes  an  Offer  Expiration  Date  (OED)  indicating  the last date on which the partner may accept the offer.  The OED is normally 85 days from the military department approval (MILAP) milestone in the DSAMS, except for countries that  have  been  approved  a  longer  OED.    See  DoD  5105.38-M,  Chapter  5  for  countries that  have  been  approved  a  longer  OED.    Short  OEDs  are  used  for  USG  driven requirements.    If  the  partner  has  less  than  the  normal  OED,  the  implementing  agency must include the mandatory short OED LOA note.  See DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 5 for guidelines on short OEDs when the purchaser has less than the standard period to review the LOA. 4.5.4.19.  Availability,  Period  of  Performance  and  lead-times  are  stated  in  months  with (1) reflecting the month the case was implemented.  When determining availability, lead-times  such  as  administrative,  procurement  or  production,  must  be  considered,  including start-up time for closed production lines. 4.5.5.  Cost Information. 4.5.5.1.  LOAD must show all applicable FMS elements  of costs.  See DoD 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulations (FMRs), Volume 15, Security Assistance Policy and Procedures for detailed security assistance financial procedures.  AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, provides escalation rate factors. 4.5.5.2.  Basic  cost  estimates  for  principal  and  major  items  to  be  procured  should  come from contractors through the procurement activity. 4.5.5.3.  Itemize  cost  data  when  it  is  needed  (unit  costs  include  these  costs),  such  as:  patent  or  royalty  rights,  nonrecurring  costs,  sales  commissions  and  contingent  fees, AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   49  provisioning,  documentation  and  effort  (PD&E),  factors  for  general  economic  trends, contract  administrative  (admin)  services  (CAS)  and  contract  audit  costs,  government-furnished  services  such  as  packing,  crating,  handling,  and  transportation  (PCH&T), technical  documentation,  cost  factor  for  government-provided  engineering  services,  test and evaluation costs, audit of claims costs, and warranty costs. 4.5.5.4.  Include  other  direct  costs,  such  as  personnel  and  travel,  if  applicable.    See Section 4.6 of this manual for detailed information on preparing manpower data. 4.5.5.5.  CAS  surcharges  are  applied  to  LOAs  in  accordance  with  Section  21  (h)  of  the AECA.  CAS should not be applied to LOA lines/sublines with a Source of Supply (SoS) code of ―S‖  (stock).   CAS  must be applied to  the base prices of  each  LOA line/subline with  a SoS code of ―P‖  (procurement).  CAS  must  be  applied to  the base price of each LOA  line/subline  with  a  SoS  code  of  ―X‖  (mixed  stock/procurement)  for  the  portion expected  to  come  from  procurement.      CAS  does  not  apply  to  the  portion  expected  to come  from  stock.    Certain  governments  are  granted  waivers  of  specific  CAS  elements based  on  formal  reciprocal  agreements  in  accordance  with  the  AECA,  Section  21  (h).  CAS waivers are case-based and apply to new cases implemented on or after the waiver date.  Detailed CAS waiver information can be found in DoD 5105.38-M. 4.5.6.  Aircraft  Ferry  LOAD  Requirements.    If  the  purchaser  requests  to  have  aircraft delivered by the AF, the LOAD must include the following data: 4.5.6.1.  Aircraft  production  or  maintenance  schedules,  desired  delivery  dates,  and  the quantity of aircraft. 4.5.6.2.  Number of flights needed for delivery. 4.5.6.3.  Cost  of  ferrying  aircraft  from  the  manufacturer  to  the  disassembly  point  for preparation for air shipment. 4.5.6.4.  Crew  per  diem  (based  on  the  average  number  of  days  required  to  deliver  the aircraft), including average delay times. 4.5.6.5.  Transportation  from  the  crew's  present  duty  station  or  location  to  point  of aircraft pickup in the continental US (CONUS).  Return transportation of crew priced at commercial rates from the point of delivery in-country to the crew's present duty station or location.  If the duty station is not known at the time of the LOAD study, estimate the price for the return based on a midpoint in the CONUS. 4.5.6.6.  Petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) costs (POL flying-hour rate for the aircraft times  the  number  of  flying  hours  required  for  delivery)  and  en  route  ground  servicing costs. 4.5.6.7.  Cost  of  in-flight  refueling  based  on  the  full  flying-hour  rate  of  the  aircraft required for refueling times the number of flying hours required, and pay of the crew and crew per diem. 4.5.6.8.  Cost  for  de-fueling,  purging,  disassembling,  preparing,  packaging,  and  on-loading of aircraft at the disassembly point, and reverse assembly. 4.5.6.9.  Estimated  cost  of  the  Special  Assignment  Airlift  Mission  (SAAM)  flights  and any support mission.   50  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 4.5.6.10.  Cost  of  reassembly  of  aircraft  in  country,  including  transportation,  materiel, and flight test. 4.5.6.11.  Prorated costs for AF shipping fixtures. 4.5.6.12.  Any other costs for the mission, such as spare parts for reassembly, over-flight charges, landing and parking fees, ramp services, etc.  These should be identified in the LOAD. 4.5.6.13.  Cost  of escort  aircraft services based on the full flying-hour rate of the escort aircraft times the number of flying hours required. 4.5.6.14.  Cost of air rescue service and navigational assistance aircraft, if needed, based on the full flying-hour rate of the aircraft times the number of flying-hours required and pay  of  the  crew,  including  per  diem.    These  costs  are  prorated  if  the  assistance  aircraft will also be servicing other countries while on the same mission.  The basis for reduction is  the  number  of  countries  served  while  on  the  mission,  rather  than  the  total  number  of aircraft delivered on the mission. 4.5.6.15.  If DSCA approves surface delivery of  aircraft, coverage and notes must be in the LOA.  The LOAD study must consider the following: 4.5.6.15.1.  Delivery  to  port  of  embarkation  or  preparation  facility  point  of  USG acceptance or storage. 4.5.6.15.2.  Preparation for shipment. 4.5.6.15.3.  Cocooning or crating. 4.5.6.15.4.  Porthandling costs. 4.5.6.15.5.  Types of surface transportation. 4.5.6.15.6.  Destination port handling. 4.5.6.15.7.  Uncocooning or uncrating. 4.5.6.15.8.  Reassembly. 4.5.6.15.9.  Transportation to airfield. 4.5.6.15.10.  Functional check flight (FCF). 4.5.6.15.11.  FCF support. 4.5.6.15.12.  Caretaker, if needed. 4.5.6.16.  The  purchaser  may  take  responsibility  for  "destination  port  handling"  through "transportation to airfield."  If the purchaser asks for a FCF by an AF crew, a caretaker is mandatory. 4.5.7.  Inventory  Aircraft,  Missiles,  and  Helicopters  LOAD  Requirements.    DoD 7000.14-R,  Volume  15,  Chapter  7  contains  guidance  for  pricing  articles  supplied  from  the AF  inventory.    The  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force/Financial  Management  and Comptroller, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, Directorate of Budget Management and Execution,  Assistant  for  Security  Assistance  (SAF/FMBMS)  computes  prices  of  inventory aircraft, missiles, and helicopters for the AF based on historical cost data and data provided AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   51  by  the  Line  Manager  using  a  "Request  for  Inventory  Aircraft,  Missiles,  and  Helicopter Pricing" checklist. 4.5.7.1.  The  CM  is  responsible  for  obtaining  LOAD.    Aircraft,  missile,  and  helicopter availability  are  obtained  from  SAF/IAPD.    If  availability  is  based  on  the  items  being excess  or  if  a  diversion  of  assets  is  required  under  DoD  5105.38-M,  Chapter  6, SAF/IAPD  must  coordinate  with  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff/Operations,  Plans  and Requirements (AF/A5) office. 4.5.7.2.  The  CM  will  obtain  required  information  from  the  owning  activity  in coordination with the system program director (SPD). 4.5.7.3.  SAF/FMBMS  will  provide  historical  acquisition  value  and  compute  the estimated  transfer  value  for  reporting  to  DSCA  and  Congress.    If  the  sale  is  made  with cash or repayable credit, the Line Manager must request final pricing from SAF/FMBMS after the items have been transferred.  These prices will be used for a final billing to the purchaser. is 4.5.7.4.  The  Air  Force  Materiel  Command  (AFMC) the  office  of  primary responsibility  (OPR)  for  inventory  engine  pricing,  and  the  air  logistics  center  (ALC) engine  managers  are  the  OPRs  for  inventory  engine  availability.    Engine  managers provide the estimated price to AFMC for coordination and approval, before submitting it to  the  AFSAC  Line  Manager.    The  AFSAC  Line  Manager  must  ensure  that  the  engine manager's  estimated  price  has  been  coordinated  and  approved  with  AFMC  before submitting  it  to  the  CM.    AFMC  will  ensure  the  estimated  engine  pricing  has  been performed as specified in DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15, Chapter 7, and reflects adjustment for age or condition. 4.5.8.  Federal  Contract  Research  Center  (FCRC)  LOAD  Requirements.  SAF/IA must provide  the  following  information  (required  when  LOAD  is  developed)  to  SAF/AQ  on  a casebycase basis when FCRCs are being considered: 4.5.8.1.  A brief description of the program and the proposed FCRC involvement. 4.5.8.2.  A  statement  indicating  the  estimated  totals  of  FCRC  manpower,  time,  and dollars required to support the program and the source of the funds. 4.5.8.3.  Whether or not the FCRC is a directed source.  Discuss the availability of other contractors, their technical qualifications, expertise, and timing considerations. 4.5.8.4.  Private sector reactions to the proposed FCRC involvement. 4.5.8.5.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  FCRC  FMS  effort  on  the  FCRC  support  to  DoD programs (including the impact on the FCRC ceiling). 4.5.9.  COMSEC LOAD Requirements. 4.5.9.1.  Requests for LOAD for Communications Security (COMSEC) items are sent to AFSAC  for  tasking.    See  National  COMSEC  Instruction  (NACSI)  6001,  FMS  of Communications  Security  and  Services  to  Foreign  Governments  and  International Organizations,  Annex  A  for  further  detail.    Tasking  usually  is  directed  to  Electronic Systems  Center,  Cryptologic  Systems  Group  (ESC/CPSG)  for  defense  articles  and  to AFSAT  for  training.    The  latest  procedures  for  the  release  and  approval  to  offer   52  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 COMSEC  equipment  and  embedded  cryptographic  modules  are  in  DoD  5105.38-M, Chapters 3 and 4. 4.5.9.2.  Classified articles are transported by the Defense Transportation System (DTS), Defense Courier Service or registered and certified mail.  Applicable transportation cost must  be  identified  for  appropriate  accessorial  charges.    Controlled  cryptographic  items (CCI)  must  be  transported  by  NSA-approved  method.    LOAD  will  identify  whether  or not each article and service is classified, CCI, or unclassified. 4.5.9.3.  When  possible,  the  transfer  of  articles  should  be  made  at  the  purchaser's embassy,  mission  in  CONUS,  or  designated  COSMEC  account  in  CONUS.    The embassy,  mission,  or  other  location  must  have  adequate  and  proper  COMSEC  storage and  an  established  COMSEC  account.    Classified  items  may  also  be  shipped  to  freight forwarders who have been cleared to receive classified shipments.  Delivery instructions will be coordinated with the purchaser and detailed in the LOA note. 4.5.9.4.  Use  of  Air  Post  Office  (APO)  or  Fleet  Post  Office  (FPO)  mail  and  State Department  (DoS)  pouch  services  is  not  permitted.    Exceptions  will  be  approved  by DSCA on a  casebycase  basis.  Defense Courier  Services  are only  available to  Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) countries or international partners. 4.5.9.5.  When  an  article  must  be  obtained  from  an  agency  outside  the  AF,  that  agency should  be  requested  to  furnish  the  LOAD  through  appropriate  agency  channels (Electronic Systems Center's Cryptologic Systems Group (ESC/CPSG)) as a separate line item. 4.5.9.6.  The LOAD must state whether or not each article or service has been approved for  release  to  the  purchaser.    Instructions  must  be  included  for  submitting  orders  or requisitions for blanket order lines. 4.5.10.  Reviewing LOAD. 4.5.10.1.  Organizations  preparing  LOAD  will  establish  an  internal  review  process.  LOAD must be fully coordinated prior to replying to the tasking. 4.5.10.2.  The SAPM should not change prices or schedules provided by a Line Manager without first coordinating with the appropriate Line Manager.  If differences remain, the SAPM should forward the disagreement to the CM for resolution. 4.5.10.3.  Before  preparing  the  LOA,  the  CM  should  discuss  the  accuracy  and completeness  of data with  the SAPM or  Line Manager as  appropriate.  The CM should not change prices or schedules provided by the SAPM without notifying the SAPM/Line Manager. 4.5.11.  Classified Materiel on LOA. 4.5.11.1.  When classified materiel is reflected on LOA documents, classified items must be  broken  down  by  description  of  the  materiel  and  quantity  on  a  defined  order  line.   A line  item  using  a  MASL  for  services  cannot  include  materiel  unless  the  materiel  being provided  is  incidental  to  the  provision  of  the  service.    Classified  materiel,  including publications,  cannot  be  included  within  a  services  line  and  must  be  broken  out  on  a separate  defined  order  line  with  the  description  and  quantity.    Classified  publications should not be embedded into a mixed (classified and unclassified) publications line. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   53  4.6.  Preparing Manpower Data. 4.6.1.  General. 4.6.1.1.  AF military and civilian personnel including members of the Air National Guard (ANG)  provide  program  management  and  defense  services  in  support  of  FMS  cases.  Security assistance manpower requirements compete with AF and DoD programs during the budgeting and programming process and are accommodated within the approved AF budget  and  applicable  end-strength  ceilings.    As  such,  the  use  of  military  resources  is subject  to  the  same  military  end-strength  ceiling  governing  other  AF  programs.    In instances  when  military  resources  are  not  available  due  to  AF  military  end-strength ceilings,  FMS  manpower  requests  should  consider  civilian  or  contractor  alternatives  or identify appropriate military offsets by Program Element Code (PEC). 4.6.1.2.  Section 42(f) of AECA requires contractor personnel to be used to the maximum extent  possible  to  perform  defense  services  in  foreign  countries.    Additionally,  AF guidance  requires  contractor  personnel  to  be  used  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  to perform non-inherently governmental FMS work in CONUS. 4.6.1.3.  An  AF  function  performed  by  military  or  DoD  civilian  employees  may  not  be converted to contractor manpower, in whole or in part, unless the conversion is based on the results of a public-private competition that formally compares the cost of performance of  the  function  of  AF  civilian  employees  with  the  cost  of  performance  by  a  contractor.  There are two exceptions to this rule. 4.6.1.3.1.  The  component  competitive  sourcing  official  determines  that  certain activities  are  inherently  governmental  and  not  suitable  for  performance  by  a  private provider. 4.6.1.3.2.  There is a mission-related reason to bring work in-house or where statutes allow  the  commander  to  determine  if  performance  by  appropriated  fund  (APF)  or non-appropriated fund (NAF) employees is more beneficial to the government. 4.6.2.  Determining General Manpower Requirements and Funding Sources. 4.6.2.1.  Manpower  resources  are  managed  by  a  cooperative  process involving SAF/IAPX  and  the  MAJCOM  Servicing  Manpower  office.    During  the  development  of an LOA the CCM, in conjunction with the SAPM, may determine if execution of the case requires  dedicated  manpower  resources.    The  processes  used  to  determine  security assistance  manpower  requirements  are  the  same  as  those  for  the  AF  (see  AFI  38-201, Determining  Manpower  Requirements).    Exceptions  will  be  made  only  when  the workload  required  for  the  partner  is  not  governed  by  AF  manpower  standards.    All defined manpower requirements must be documented by the development of a manpower requirements  package  (MRP)  that  lists  each  manpower  position,  TDY,  and  personnel support cost (PSC) requirement. 4.6.2.1.1.  Manpower  Requirements  Package  (MRP).    The  MRP  documents  and justifies  all  case  and  administrative  (admin)  funded  AF  and  contractor  manpower necessary to execute an FMS case.  The MRP is made up of the case-funded MTDS, admin-funded  MTDS,  and  an  explanation  of  manpower  requirements.    The  MRP  is essential  in  defining  the  workload  and  determining  the  requirements  needed  to   54  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 support  the  FMS  case.    The  MRP  is  necessary  for  any  dedicated  allocations,  FMS case or administrative surcharge. 4.6.2.1.2.  Manpower  Travel  and  Data  Sheet  (MTDS).    The  MTDS  documents  all manpower,   travel, and Personnel Support Costs (PSC) associated with any LOA line containing manpower.  There are two types of MTDS:  (1) case-funded requirements and (2) admin-funded requirements.  The case-funded MTDS is a DSCA requirement that  seeks  to  clearly  define  and  summarize  the  total  manpower,  travel  and  PSC required to execute an FMS case.  The admin-funded MTDS is an internal Air Force document  and  should  not  be  provided  to  DSCA  as  part  of  the  LOA  document package;  and  is  not  to  be  provided  to  customer.    The  MTDS’  provide  a  standard reporting practice among MILDEPs.  Upon approval of the MRP, the MTDS should be updated with the SAF/IA Approval Number prior to submitting to DSCA. 4.6.2.2.  All undefined manpower services lines must be documented by the development of  a  stand-alone  line  entry  on  an  MTDS.    If  an  LOA  has  both  defined  and  undefined manpower  lines,  all  manpower  lines  will  be  listed  on  the  same  MTDS  as  a  whole manpower  requirements  package  without  omitting  any  manpower  services  lines  for  the applicable MAJCOM. 4.6.2.3.  Whenever feasible, a standardized model should be used to build an MRP in the Security  Assistance  Manpower  Requirements  System  (SAMRS).    A  lengthy  manpower justification  is  not  required  when  these  models  are  used,  because  they  have  been  pre-approved by SAF/IA and DSCA. access  SAMRS, 4.6.2.3.1.

Historical data (evaluation of current normal and past workload) may be used to validate  new  manpower  requirements.    In  addition,  any  anticipated  non-routine,  non-standard, and one-time annual workload should be measured, validated, and appropriate manpower resources must be programmed to offset such workload. 4.6.2.5.  All case-specific pre-LOR and case development work must be documented with an MRP (Attachment 4).  If a Pre-LOR effort has exceeded or expect to exceed a funding threshold, a member of the security  assistance  community must provide the appropriate SAF/IA Country Director with the best estimate on Pre-LOR efforts. 4.6.2.5.1.  All  case-specific  manpower  requirements  for  the  pre-  LOR  and  case development  efforts  are  funded  IAW  the  DoD  5105.38-M,  Chapter  5,  Table  C5.T6, Case-Related Manpower Functions and Funding Source.  The applicable manpower funding  matrix  rows  are  1  through  11  for  all  case  types.    If  the  cost  incurred,  or expected  to  be  incurred,  exceeds  0.25  man-year  or  $25,000,  the  FMS  admin  budget will  receive  a  refund  from  the  resulting  case.    If  no  case  results,  no  refund  will  be issued.  These thresholds do not apply to the row numbers 6, 9, and 10.  In addition, a funding  requirement  from  $25,000  to  $250,000  requires  approval  from  SAF/IAR.  Any amount over $250,000 requires approval from Assistant SAF/IA. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   55  4.6.2.6.  FMS  manpower  requirements  must  be  categorized  based  on  the  duties  and  the level  of  service  performed.    The  categories  determine  the  funding  source.    Category definitions are as follows: 4.6.2.6.1.  Category  1  (Case-Funded):    Those  efforts  over  and  above  the  Standard Level  of  Service  (SLS)  that  are  specific  to  a  partner  or  program  (either  partner  or USAF  directed),  involve  unique  or  specific  request  from  a  foreign  partner,  a  non-standard  process,  additional  business  requirements  (i.e.,  more than  normal requirement  for  reviews  and  reports),  or  involving  non-standard  systems  (i.e., modifications,  obsolete  equipment,  items  outside  USAF  channels).    Note:    for  non-standard  systems,  not  all  manpower  will  be  above  SLS;  it  is  recognized  there  is  a component of SLS provided (includes civilian pay/benefits, TDY, Contractors, PSC). 4.6.2.6.2.  Category  2  (FMS  Admin-Funded,  SLS  Case  Specific):    Acquisition, sustainment,  and  training  support  and  services  provided  using  normal  US  practices and procedures that can be tied to a specific case(s)’ FMS admin-funded MTDS.  See DoD  5105.38-M,  Chapter  5,  Table  C5.T6  (matrix  includes  civilian  pay/benefits, TDY, Contractors, PSC) for further reference. 4.6.2.6.3.  Category  3    (Non-Case  Specific,  Infrastructure):    Includes  FMS  admin-funded efforts for case execution, case closure, centralized case support, contracting, and  legal  support  services  that  are  not  tied  to  a specific  case.    It  also  includes  FMS administrative  resources  required  by  an  organization  to  sustain  business  operations including,  pre-LOR,  pre-LOA,  case  development,  workforce  development,  general administration, headquarters functions, and information technology support. 4.6.2.7.  On  cases  accepted  on  or  after  1  August  2006,  any  manpower  services  that  go above  and  beyond  the  SLS  will  be  included  on  a  well-defined  ‖Other  Services‖  line, using  PEC  A2002I.    The  case-funded  justification  will  be  provided  with  the  LOA  line item note that is a tailored description which must include details describing exactly what services/activities  these  line  items  will  provide  and  the  length  of  time  they  will  be performed. 4.6.2.7.1.  On cases accepted on or after 1 August 2006, the administrative surcharge is 3.8% for all lines.  Any changes to existing lines with a 2.5% surcharge that have an  increase  in  the  scope  (quantity,  dollar  value  or  Period  of  Performance)  require  a new line to be established. 4.6.2.8.  For cases implemented prior to 1 August 2006, a case funded position may have a PEC of A2002A for Program Management Line (PML).  PMLs may not be used on a new  case  and  may  not  be  extended.    PMLs  on  an  existing  case  may  be  executed  in  its present scope and remain on those cases/lines until the case/line is closed.  Adjustments may  be  made  to  existing  PMLs  via  LOA  Modification  or  Amendment  as  long  as  these adjustments  are  within  the  current  scope  of  the  PML  –  no  adjustments  will  be  made  to increase  the  scope  of  these  line  items.    Any  new  requirement  (scope  change)  on  a previous PML will be documented using a new ―Other Services‖ line. 4.6.2.9.  Any  embedded  manpower  line  on  the  LOA  with  a  defined  or  undefined manpower requirement on a materiel or an equipment line will be documented using the   56  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 funding  requirement  specific  to  the  manpower  portion(s)  only.    This  includes  any  case-related TDY requirement. 4.6.2.10.  If  manpower  services  performed  are  indistinguishable  from  the  materiel  or equipment on the line, the entire line value should be documented on the MTDS. 4.6.2.10.1.  The  MTDS  pricing  data  should  match  the  RP069  Document  Pricing Calculations  report  in  DSAMS.    For  example,  the  RP069’s  primary  category  code (PCC)  of  07,  TDY  pricing  data,  should  match  the  MTDS  Part  B  Travel  cost  data whether it is a basic or an amended LOA.  All PCC pricing in the RP069 must match the MTDS Parts A, B, and C. 4.6.2.10.1.1.  For  any  revised  component  price  of  an  amended  LOA  line  in  the RP069, an additional PCC entry will be made, unless it is a price decrease.  For example,  the  RP069  for  Amendment  2  extending  manpower  services  will  show two PCC entries of 01 for Civilian Personnel Services. 4.6.2.10.2.  Any  manpower  salary  associated  with  a  travel  requirement  must  be separated out and listed under the MTDS Part A.  The broken out data must be listed in RP069 using the applicable cost data for USG travel requirements.  Any contractor travel requirement is included with the applicable contract cost.  The MTDS approval can be delayed, if any cost data do not match.  The reimbursable salaries associated with a travel requirement under Part B of the MTDS must be separated out for both organic  and  contractor  travelers  and  listed  under  Part  A  Personnel.    Only  the  TDY expenses should be listed under Part B.  If the salaries can be broken out by organic and  contractor  categories,  they  must  be  listed  separately  under  Part  A.    If  not,  the salaries must be listed together using one line under Part A.  If the manpower detail is known, each individual traveler’s salary must be listed individually. 4.6.2.11.  FMS  manpower  requirements  can  be  funded  by  either  admin  surcharge  or direct  case-related  money.    Guidelines  for  determining  the  correct  source  of  funds  are outlined in the DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 5, Table C5.T6. 4.6.2.12.  Standard Level of Service (SLS).  SLS represents the level of service necessary to  write,  implement,  manage,  execute  and  close  FMS  cases.    These  services  should  be funded  with  administrative  surcharge  funds.    DoD  5105.38-M,  Chapter  5,  Table  C5.T6 provides  guidance  on  what  requirements  fall  within  SLS.    The  table  also  identifies services  that  are  above  the  SLS.    Those  services  are  funded  by  the  FMS  case.  Requirements that are funded by admin surcharge should not be included and/or priced in the LOA above the line pricing.  The implementing agency may determine that additional USG  program  management  services,  beyond  those  covered  in  the  ―Standard  Level  of Service,‖  are  necessary  for  successful  program  implementation  and  execution.    Other Services  lines  (formally  Program  Management  Lines)  are  used  to  cover  the  costs  of system or program management efforts the AF must undertake to successfully deliver the article  purchased  by  the  partner.    Other  Services  lines  may  also  cover  costs  for  non-routine administrative management services as identified in DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 5, Table  C5.T6.    An  example  of  such  service  is  Systems  Integration  or  Configuration Management. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   57  4.6.2.12.1.  For  all  MRPs  with  SLS  defined  manpower  requirements,  a  revalidation MRP-MTDS  must  be  submitted  when  the  International  Program  Directive  (IPD)  is issued on an accepted LOA.  An approved revalidation MTDS is given the status of ―Revalidation  Complete‖  in  SAMRS  and  can  be  used  to  substantiate  a  MAJCOM’s SLS funding requirements. 4.6.2.12.2.  The MRP case ID must match the DSAMS LOA ID, except for the MRP Modifications (Mods).   An MRP Mod applies to the version of the MRP associated with an LOA. 4.6.2.13.  Manpower  to  support  special  services  at  the  request  of  the  partner  should  be included on a services or technical assistance line as appropriate.  Pre-LOA efforts should be  captured  as  an  administrative  SLS  or  direct  case-related  service,  as  defined  by  DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 5, Table C5.T6. 4.6.2.14.  Positions  performing  workload  in  support  of  International  Military  Education and  Training  (IMET)  are  funded  with  Congressionally-approved  Foreign  Military Financing (FMF).  IMET is not funded with FMS funds. 4.6.2.15.  Military  positions  can  be  funded  with  repayable  FMF  credits.    Section  503(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, as Amended prohibits a reimbursement of military position salaries from non-repayable FMF cases. 4.6.2.16.  Approval  of  manpower  requirements  uses  estimated  civilian  grades  to determine the cost to the case.  The servicing civilian personnel office will determine the actual or allocated grade of a position during the classification process. 4.6.2.17.  If a best estimated case-funded civilian grade requirement is not implemented, for  reasons  such  as  local  hiring  conditions  or  organic  manpower  non-availability,  an MRP  modification  must  be  submitted  for  SAF/IA  approval  to  document  any  change  to the  requirement  (i.e.,  GS-12  to  a  contractor).    If  the  position  changes  from  civilian  to  a contractor and results in a manpower line price increase, an LOA Modification must be submitted as a price change.  If sufficient funds do not exist, a case amendment must be developed for the partner’s acceptance to add more funds to the case as a price change. 4.6.2.18.  When  determining  FMS  manpower  requirements,  first  use  AFMAN  38-255, Air Force Management Engineering Program, which is the AF guidance that determines manpower standards, or any other applicable published manpower study which provides the overarching guidance for manpower requirements. 4.6.2.19.  When  an  applicable  Air  Force  Manpower  Standard  (AFMS)  does  not  exist, historical  records  from  SAMRS  will  be  the  primary  method  used  to  determine  FMS manpower,  travel,  and  PSC  requirements;  use  of  other  USAF  approved  manpower estimation methods and techniques is optional, and it is up to each MAJCOM Servicing Manpower office to provide further guidance as necessary 4.6.3.  Rated Manpower Requirements. 4.6.3.1.  A minimum of one-year lead-time is required for rated (military) positions.  This one-year period commences on approval of the requirements by Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff/ Operations, Plans & Requirements, Operational Training (AF/A3O-AT).  Note:    58  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 AF-rated  manpower  requirements  may  be  included  in  the  LOA  only  after  AF/A3O-AT approval. 4.6.3.2.  After receipt of an LOR for rated manpower requirements, the CM will prepare and  forward  a  manpower  package  addressing  requirements  to  the  appropriate  SAF/IA Country Director.  The package will include the following items: 4.6.3.2.1.  A copy of the LOR. 4.6.3.2.2.  Background  information  as  outlined  in  the  Security  Assistance  Rated Officer Requirement Analysis Checklist (Attachment 5). 4.6.3.2.3.  Manpower summary for TAFT/ETSS (Attachment 6). 4.6.3.2.4.  DSCA LOA Manpower and Travel Data Sheet (Attachment 4). 4.6.3.2.5.  AF  Form  480,  Aircrew  AFSC/Active  Flying  Justification,  for  each  rated position 4.6.3.3.  The Country Director will: 4.6.3.3.1.  Review the justification. 4.6.3.3.2.  Process  request  for  new  or  extended  AF-related  manpower  positions through applicable channels, via AF/A3O-AT for approval. 4.6.3.3.3.  Include  an  impact  assessment  and  supporting  documentation  in  the package. 4.6.3.3.4.  Include  the  Security  Assistance  Rated  Officer  Requirement  Analysis Checklist as a supporting document. 4.6.3.3.5.  Include SAF/IAPX (Manpower Section) in the coordination process. 4.6.4.  Non-Rated  Manpower  Requirements.  All  requirements  stated  in  paragraph  4.6.2. apply.    For  SAF/IA,  allow  a  minimum  lead-time  of  3  days  for  non-rated  manpower requirements. 4.6.4.1.  After receipt of an LOR indicating manpower requirements AFSAT will prepare an  MTDS  (Attachment  4)  and  forward  it  to  the  AETC  Manpower  and  Organization Division.  On conclusion of the AETC approval process, the package will be forwarded to SAF/IAPX for final approval and allocation.  AFSAT will notify the AETC Manpower and Organization Division and SAF/IAPX using SAMRS IPD issues notification e-mail when  the  FMS  case  has  been  accepted  and  the  initial  deposit  has  been  processed  by DFAS-IN/JAX.  The package will include the following items: 4.6.4.1.1.  A copy of the LOR. 4.6.4.1.2.  Manpower summary for TAFT/ETSS (Attachment 6). 4.6.4.1.3.  DSCA LOA Manpower and Travel Data Sheet (Attachment 4). 4.6.4.1.4.  Any  other  non-rated  manpower  requirements  from  AETC  or  another MAJCOM  will  be  handled  on  a  case  by  case  basis  in  concert  with  a  SAF/IAPX manpower validator.  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   59  4.6.5.  Manpower Requirements Package (MRP). 4.6.5.1.  The  functional  OPR  (SAPM/CCM/Line  Manager)  and  the  local  manpower office will jointly develop the MRP IAW Attachment 4 using the SAMRS. 4.6.5.1.1.  SAMRS is the automated System of Record (SOR) for AF MRPs. 4.6.5.1.2.  All  FMS  manpower  requirements,  military, in-house  organic,  and contractors,  will  be  submitted  for  review  and  approval  in  SAMRS.    Manpower  in support  of  specific  FMS  programs  is  provided  on  FMS  cases  –  either  on  applicable services lines or included directly in the price of materiel and/or services lines. 4.6.5.2.  The  SAPM/CCM  will  validate  and  consolidate  multiple  inputs  from  the individual work centers, within the same command, into the MRP  before forwarding to the  MAJCOM  Servicing  Manpower  Office.    For  a  case  with  manpower  requirements from  two  or  more  MAJCOMs,  the  MAJCOM  that  provides  predominant  products  or services on a  case will act  as the lead MAJCOM.  The lead MAJCOM will request  the other  participating  MAJCOMs  to  submit  an  MRP  in  SAMRS.    AETC  is  the  lead MAJCOM for all ―T‖ (training) cases. 4.6.5.3.  SAF/IAPX will approve both lead and associated MAJCOMs MRP-MTDS and issue a manpower allocation memorandum to respective commands.  This is to facilitate accountability  and  tracking  of  multi-MAJCOM  case  manpower  positions  and  to  reduce the  likelihood  of  associated  MAJCOM  omitting  required  documentation  for  follow-on amendments,  revisions,  and  modifications  affecting  manpower.    It  is  incumbent  on  the associated  MAJCOM informed  on  any  changes  requiring  manpower documentation through tracking the status of multi-MAJCOM cases.  The lead MAJCOM CCM will provide any required information to associated MAJCOM, if requested by the associated MAJCOM. to  stay 4.6.5.4.  All  LOA  lines,  equipment  or  services  that  include  undefined  (blanket  order) lines  containing  manpower  requirements  must  have  a  period  of  performance  for  the manpower.  They also must be documented on an MTDS unless specifically exempted by DSCA or SAF/IA. 4.6.5.5.  SAF/IAPX  approval  is  required  for  all  applicable  MRP-MTDS  prior  to  case submission to DSCA/OPS/CWD. 4.6.6.  Manpower and Travel Data Sheet (MTDS). 4.6.6.1.  The MTDS  is  a DSCA mandated document (Attachment 4).  When an MRP is created in the SAMRS, an MTDS is automatically created as part of the MRP package. 4.6.6.2.  An MTDS is required for an LOA line containing case-funded manpower (USG or  contractor),  travel  or  personnel  support  costs  (e.g.,  equipment,  IT  support,  phone service,  supplies  and  materials)  or  manpower  services.    An  MTDS  must accompany  all LOAs  that  require  case-funded  manpower,  case-funded  travel,  or  case-funded  PSC.  Counter-signature  may  be  delayed  if  the  MTDS  is  not  included  in  the  LOA  package submitted to DSCA. 4.6.6.3.  The MTDS is required for all basic LOAs, Amendments and Modifications with change  in  cost  for  active  lines  or  period  of  performance  increases.    The  MTDS  should reflect the exact costs on the LOA line.  For all other LOA lines that have manpower, any   60  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 differences between the MTDS and LOA lines should be detailed in Part E of the MTDS.  A  restatement  MTDS  is  accomplished  to  accommodate  LOA  changes  after  initial SAF/IAPX approval, but prior to the case being offered to country.  An example would be a replacement of organic manpower with a contractor or vice versa within same skill area.    If  a  previously  approved  MTDS  must  be  corrected  line  by  line  or  to  delete/add line(s), a modification MRP is accomplished.  For either a modified or restated MRP, a modification template is used in SAMRS. is  also  used  when 4.6.6.4.  Off-line  version the  International  Support  Branch (AFSAC/IARS) case management needs SAF/IAPX approval code to proceed with LOA manpower  line  documentation  when  SAMRS  is  not  available.    When  the  automated SAMRS  MRP  and  MTDS  are  accomplished,  pre-approved  manual  MTDS  will  be discarded, but SAF/IAPX will retain a record of such approval using an MTDS Approval log. 4.6.6.5.  If manpower changes result in changes in the scope of manpower lines, an MRP-MTDS amendment will be completed.  An amendment MRP-MTDS always identifies a change  in  partner  requirements.    If  such  a  change  in  scope  requires  additional  funds request from the partner, then an LOA Amendment with associated MRP-MTDS must be completed for DSCA approval and partner acceptance. 4.6.6.6.  Updated MTDS in Attachment 4 adds a column to identify exactly what type of case-funded  support  is  provided  on  a  case  by  manpower  funding  source  matrix  row number.  The matrix requires ―incremental‖ costing for certain activities that exceed the ―Standard  Level  of  Service.‖    This  will  help  ensure  partners  pay  only  for  additional requirements – and not for services covered by FMS admin surcharge. 4.6.6.7.  Admin  surcharge  position  requests  are  submitted  following  the  standard  MRP submission procedure using SAMRS for any full-time FMS admin position requirement.  If  an  in-house  organic  admin  position  requirement  is  less  than  one  man-year,  it  will  be treated  as  a  full-time  admin  position,  i.e.,  5.5  man-years  in  a  fiscal  year  will  require  6 full-time  manpower  authorizations  if  no  sharable  manpower  positions  exists.  An administrative  manpower  position  may  be  shared  with  any  current  or  future  fractional manpower requirements. 4.6.7.  Manpower  Data  for  Technical  Assistance  Field  Teams  (TAFT)  and  Extended Training Services Specialist (ETSS) Cases. 4.6.7.1.  TAFT  and  ETSS  manpower  performs  technical  services  or  specialized  training either requested by the partner or deemed necessary to support a major system sale. 4.6.7.2.  AFSAT  manages  the  ETSS  program  via  applicable  FMS  cases/lines.    AFSAT managers  coordinate  with  SAF/IA  Country  Directors  on  all  new  or  extended  ETSS positions to ensure proper visibility and staffing of ETSS high interest issues (e.g., rated manpower resources). 4.6.7.3.  SAF/IA  Country  Directors  are  also  responsible  for    ensuring  Case/Line Managers  for  their  countries  are  fully  aware  of  current  AF-rated  manpower  constraints (e.g.,  to  include  any  existing  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  AF  (CSAF)  approved  agreements concerning international requirements/allocations). AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   61  4.6.7.3.1.  An example is AFSAT-managed ETSS personnel requests. 4.6.7.4.  Country  Directors  and  CM  will  also  ensure  that  international  partners requesting/requiring  AF-rated  manpower  via  FMS  cases  understand  constraints  prior  to LOR submission.  Alternatives (e.g., contractor support) to AF-manpower should be fully considered. 4.6.7.5.  SAF/IA  Country  Directors  are  responsible  for  processing  requests  for  new  or extended  Air  Force-rated  manpower  positions  (e.g.,  ETSS)  through  SAF/IAPX.  SAF/IAPX  will  review  requests  and  coordinate  with  AF/A3O-AT  to  ensure  requests comply with existing rated manpower agreements/constraints. 4.6.7.6.  AFSAT  ETSS  Case/Line  Managers  have  the  primary  responsibility  for monitoring  training  programs  to  ensure  that  they  do  not  exceed  established  expiration dates.  AFSAT Case/Line Managers should communicate with SCOs/ETSS teams as well as  the  applicable  SAF/IA  Country  Director  to  identify  or  correct  program  problems and/or solicit required Letters of Request early, before they cause ETSS teams to exceed the program expiration date. 4.6.8.  Manpower Data for LOA Amendment, Modification, or Cancellation. 4.6.8.1.  An  MTDS  is  required  for  Amendments  that  change  the  scope  (increase  or decrease  of  lines  involving  manpower),  as  well  as  for  Modifications  that  increase  the value of lines involving manpower.  The MTDS for lines that do not change value, do not change PoP, or decrease in value but change scope must reflect the total personnel, travel, and  support  costs  for  lines  that  include  manpower;  not  just  the  differences  between  the previous  and  revised  amount.    For  lines  with  added  new  requirements,  only  what  has changed should be documented on the MTDS.  For Amendments, this applies to all lines being revised, whether an increase or decrease in scope.  For Modifications, this applies only  to  lines  being  revised  due  to  price  increases.    Any  exception  to  the  MTDS  policy should be IAW DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 9. 4.6.9.  FMS Admin Funded Manpower Requirements. 4.6.9.1.  MAJCOMs  will  review  and  analyze  the  execution  of  FMS  admin  funds  to determine if out-of-cycle requirements can be funded within their budget.    If funding is available but additional manpower authorizations are not, the MAJCOMs will submit an out-of-cycle  request  to  SAF/IAPX.    This  request  must  include  a  statement  of  funding availability  and  why  manpower  could  not  be  realigned  (e.g.,  difference  in  actual  lapse rate  versus  projected  lapse  rate;  difference  in  actual  case  funds  reimbursement  versus projected).    Requests  for  additional  admin  surcharge-funded  manpower  must  be processed IAW established policies and procedures in SAMRS. 4.6.10.  Annual DSCA Arms Export Control Act (AECA) FMS Manpower Report. 4.6.10.1.  Annually, each MAJCOM and any applicable SAF/IA divisions will submit to SAF/IAPX the number of assigned personnel performing full-time case-funded and full-time admin-funded civilian FMS duties.  Each reporting MAJCOM and work center will provide  an  explanation  for  any  change  or  deviation  in  manpower  assigned  from  the previous year’s reported numbers.  SAF/IAPX will compile, verify, and forward this data   62  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 to  DSCA  to  meet  the  annual  Congressional  reporting  requirement  on  manpower  in accordance with, Section 25(a)(6) of the AECA. 4.6.10.2.  This report will be provided to SAF/IAPX NLT 1 December of each year using FQ4 data of immediately preceding fiscal year.  SAF/IA will provide any deviation from this procedure in writing as necessary. 4.6.11.  Security Assistance Manpower Program “Oversight.  ” 4.6.11.1.  SAF/IAPX  FMS  manpower  guidance  oversight  role  extends  beyond  SAMRS guidance  implementation,  to  include  pre-LOR  case  development,  case  execution,  and case closure involving manpower service lines. 4.6.11.2.  MAJCOMs  will  establish  and  maintain  any  administrative  requirements  and guidance to ensure compliance in managing FMS manpower resources.  At a minimum, each  MAJCOM  and  SAF/IAPX  will  conduct  an  annual  review  of  FMS  manpower programs during the annual AECA/FMS manpower data call. 4.6.11.3.  A  copy  of  the  automated  MRP-MTDS  will  be  available  to  SAF/IAPX  via SAMRS and manual MTDS by e-mail. 4.6.11.4.  SAF/IAPX  will  be  the  lead  agent  for  all  matters  related  to  SAMRS development, system updates, and training of SAMRS users and administrators. 4.6.11.5.  SAF/IAPX  will  define  expectations  of  FMS  Manpower  Management  Reports to meet any routine or urgent mission requirements. 4.6.11.6.  Problem/Issue Resolution.  SAF/IA will provide general or specific guidance to resolve  all  discrepancies  found  in  MAJCOM  implementation  of  security  assistance guidance.  Severe guidance-related infractions could result in a formal audit. 4.6.11.7.  SAF/IA  will  conduct  assistance  visits  (SAV)  to  provide  guidance,  assistance and gain further insight into guidance implementation status at the MAJCOMs. 4.6.12.  Special Interest Case Teaming. 4.6.12.1.  Administering  ―special  interest‖  cases  is  based  on  the  key  assumption  that SAF/IA-MAJCOM to  successfully  develop  and implement ―special interest‖ cases. teaming  approach is  necessary 4.6.12.2.  SAF/IAPX  (Security  Assistance  Manpower  Policy  Analyst)  is  responsible  for forming  a  ―Special  Interest‖  Case  Manpower  Steering  Committee  (as  deemed appropriate)  to  ensure  a  SAF/IA-MAJCOM  team-oriented  approach  to  case  manpower development/staffing  to  include  any  unique  guidance  concerns  pertinent  to  the  case manpower.  Key teaming/action goals will include: 4.6.12.2.1.  Establishing  a  common  ―special  interest‖  context  associated  with  the FMS case to include an understanding of the: 4.6.12.2.1.1.  Political-military  significance/context  for  the  FMS  case  and  proper composition  of  manpower,  i.e.,  organic,  contractor,  or  foreign  direct  hire,  and skills. 4.6.12.2.1.2.  Relevant  USG/DoD/USAF  goals  and  associated  issues/concerns  to include  any  manpower  usage  constraints  relevant  to  AF  and  DoD  manpower AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   63  policies. 4.6.12.2.1.3.  Known partner expectations/concerns on special manpower requests and/or any special approach to funding case manpower requirements. 4.6.12.2.1.4.  Identify  any  concern  or  constraint  (e.g.,  policy/legal)  bearing  on manpower  utilization  and  case-unique  manpower  requirement  issues,  especially when manpower would appear to be used contrary to partner’s  preference or as approved  by  SAF/IAPX  or  DSCA.    This  is  not  only  a  partner-service  issue  but also holds significance in identifying any relevant guidance misalignment across the AF. 4.6.12.2.1.5.  Ensuring  common  understanding  of  the  requirements  of  the partner’s  LOR  as  stated  is  essential  for  an  accurate  determination  of  case manpower  requirements.    Among  other  things,  this  can  include  preliminary  data collection  using  a  Site  Survey,  or  a  logistics  support  conference.    Getting  the applicable Country Director, CCM, SAF/IA, AFSAC Business Operations Office (AFSAC/XPO), SAPM, and the program  offices  involved from  the initial  stages of a case development should assist this effort. 4.6.12.2.1.6.  Reviewing  specific  requirements  and  outlining  the  steps  for clarifying  the  LOR  (if  required)  on  manpower  support  or  service  issues  on  a potential  case.    This  could  include  timely  resolution  of  manpower  requirements issues,  ensuring  case  development  stays  on  track  with  adequate  guidance oversight, and implementing any lessons learned from similar cases. 4.6.12.3.  Key Teaming relationships and communication channels may include: 4.6.12.3.1.  SAF/IA  Country  Director  keeps  SAF/IAPX,  MAJCOM  FMS  Servicing Manpower Office, AFSAC CCM, and AFSAC/XPO informed of ―special manpower interest‖ guidance/issues. 4.6.12.3.2.  SAF/IAPX  provides  manpower  policy  expertise the  relevant stakeholders  on  any  MRP  on  proactive  mode  as  much  as  possible  and  maintains  a quick reactive capability as required. to 4.6.12.3.3.  MAJCOM  manpower  offices,  ACC,  AFMC,  AFSPC,  AFSAT, AFSAC/XPO, AFSAC CCM, SAF/IA Country Directors, and SAF/IAPX support one another  to  ensure  each  office  is  regularly  and  thoroughly  apprised  of  routine manpower  issues  and  status  of  special  interest  cases,  especially  on  key  sensitive, time-critical, and high-visibility MRPs. 4.6.12.4.  MAJCOM  will  establish  primary  and  alternate  manpower  points  of  contact (POCs) to  support any last  minute change to  the MTDS  before  going final  for DSCA’s approval and partner acceptance. 4.6.13.  SAPM/CCM Responsibilities. 4.6.13.1.  Review and validate manpower requirements submitted by other organizations (e.g.,  all  requirements  are  included,  workload  is  adequately  described  and  justified,  and the  manpower  period  of  performance  is  sufficient  to  meet  program  requirements).  Ensure MRP-MTDS is submitted when such documents are required to support an FMS case, Amendment, or Modification.   64  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 4.6.13.2.  Ensure  the  MRP  reflects  the  manpower  requirements  needed  to  support  the workload  as  stated  in  the  LOA;  justify  the  necessity  for  military  authorizations  or  the need for in-country ―blue suit‖ presence, in accordance with AFI 38-204, Programming USAF  Manpower;  and  reflect  all  dedicated  and  shared  authorizations.    Identify  and coordinate military offsets when military resources are not available. 4.6.13.3.  Reconcile proposed manpower requirements with actual program requirements among the Line Managers. 4.6.13.4.  Finalize  the  MRP,  obtain  coordination  from  all  affected  organizations’ servicing manpower offices, and electronically sign and date the MRP. 4.6.13.5.  Notify  the  relevant  MAJCOM  Servicing  Manpower  office  and  SAF/IAPX  by email when the FMS case has been accepted and the initial deposit has been processed by DFAS-IN/JAX, using SAMRS automated e-mail sender.  If SAMRS is off-line, a manual IPD should be e-mailed to the respective offices. 4.6.14.  Servicing Manpower Office Responsibilities. 4.6.14.1.  Provide manpower guidance to supported organizations. 4.6.14.2.  Assist  in  determining  manpower  requirements,  capturing  essential  manpower requirement  data  and  validating  supporting  documentation  in  accordance  with  existing manpower policies and procedures. 4.6.14.3.  Reconcile proposed requirements with actual program requirements. 4.6.14.4.  Review and approve all  routine  and special interest  MRPs prior to  submitting associated MTDS and LOA to MAJCOM. 4.6.14.5.  Monitor, track, and properly code security assistance manpower authorizations through the Manpower and Personnel Execution System (MPES). 4.6.15.  MAJCOM Responsibilities. 4.6.15.1.  Formulate  and  execute  FMS  manpower  policies  in  support  of  the  higher headquarters  FMS  manpower  policies  and  instructions,  to  include  ensuring  proper organizational  alignment  and  support  personnel  staffing  and  training  to  oversee  and execute FMS case manpower efficiently and effectively. 4.6.15.2.  Request  a  policy  waiver  from  SAF/IAPX  and  DSCA  through  the  applicable SAF/IA Country Director as the situation warrants it. 4.6.15.3.  Monitor  and  provide  feedback  to  higher  headquarters  on  current  policies  and areas for improvement of security assistance manpower policies and procedures. 4.6.15.4.  Validate  security  assistance  manpower  requirements  in  support  of  FMS workload.  This will be accomplished each time a requirement is established or changed. 4.6.15.5.  Ensure  that  essential  military  criteria  are  applied  when  validating  security assistance  manpower  requirements.    Advise  requesting  organizations  to  consider alternatives  (civilian  vs.    contractor)  or  identify  offsets  when  AF  end-strength  ceilings restrict the use of military resources. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   65  4.6.15.6.  Review and approve all  routine  and special interest  MRPs prior to  submitting associated MTDS and LOA to DSCA for signature with a copy provided to SAF/IAPX. 4.6.15.7.  Monitor  security  assistance  manpower  authorizations  through  the  Manpower and Personnel Execution System (MPES). 4.6.15.8.  Ensure  compliance  with  and  provide  feedback  on  AF  and  SAF/IA  manpower guidance and instructions. 4.6.15.9.  Issue  an  IPD  when  the  partner  deposits  funds  in  the  DFAS  partner  account against a case before executing a manpower line.  Allocate MAJCOM FMS manpower as approved in the MRP-MTDS. 4.6.15.10.  Assume primary responsibility for MAJCOM’s admin-funded and direct case-funded manpower support issues and concerns. 4.6.15.11.  Ensure  all  formal  correspondence  with  SAF/IA  reflects  the  MAJCOM-coordinated  position  by  implementing  a  vertical  chain  of  review  on  all  issues  before forwarding them to a SAF/IA POC.   This is to promote an operating environment where issues  are  resolved  at  the  lowest  echelon  possible  before  elevating,  and  to  ensure  each MAJCOM’s internal policies are followed. 4.6.16.  SAF/IA Responsibilities. 4.6.16.1.  Coordinate  with  Air  Force  Directorate  of  Manpower,  Personnel  and  Services, Manpower  and  Organization  Division  (AF/A1M)  and  other  staff  functions  to  ensure manpower  resources  for  security  assistance  are  programmed  as  approved  by  the  AF Corporate Structure in the budget call per MAJCOM and SAF/IA submissions. 4.6.16.2.  Obtain approval from  AF/A3OT for rated officer positions in support of FMS requirements (Attachment 5). 4.6.16.3.  Review  MTDS  and  approve  manpower  requirements  submitted  in  support  of AF-written LOAs, including shared manpower requirements and admin surcharge funded requirements to ensure adequate funding is available. 4.6.16.4.  Write  and  publish  responsibilities,  delegation  of  authority,  and  workload realignment  concept  of  operations  (CONOPS)  relating  to  security  assistance  guidance and procedures. 4.6.16.5.  Serve  as  the  OPR  to  update  this  manual  and  any  other  AF-wide  international affairs and security assistance manuals, supplements, and guides as deemed necessary. 4.6.16.6.  Serves  as  the  communications  conduit  on  all  matters  relating  to  security assistance  between  DSCA,  other  federal  agencies,  executive  departments,  and  the Department of the AF and MAJCOMs. 4.6.17.  DCS/FMS Hybrid Cases. 4.6.17.1.  A  hybrid  case  requires  a  modified  approach  to  funding  any  case-specific manpower, travel, and personnel support cost requirements. 4.6.17.2.  All  case  execution  and  closure  activities  specific  to  a  DCS  case  support  are 100%  direct  case-funded.    This  includes  admin  SLS,  incrementally  above  and  beyond SLS, and entirely above and beyond SLS activities that are funded under the manpower   66  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 table row numbers 12 through 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, and 39 in the DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 5. 4.6.17.3.  The FMS business sustainment activities funded under the row numbers 28, 30, 32,  34,  37,  38,  and  39  are  normally  admin-SLS  funded,  but  for  a  hybrid  case  support, they  are  fully  direct-case  fundable.    Normally,  these  activities  are  inseparable  from  the manpower positions funded under paragraph 4.6.18.2 for their direct support to a hybrid case.  SAF/IAPX will evaluate any exception to this guidance on a case by case basis. 4.6.17.4.  All  direct-case  funded  manpower  and  travel  requirements  on  a  DCS/FMS Hybrid case are justified using the phrase ―DCS/FMS Hybrid case is above and beyond the  SLS.‖    The  justification  should  not  just  state  what  is  case-fundable,  but  must  be specific  as  to  why  and  how  they  are  above  and  beyond  SLS.    However,  if  a  SAMRS Committee/DSCA-approved FMS manpower model is used, a concise description should be used in lieu of a lengthy justification: 4.6.17.4.1.  Example:    ―The  F-16  Sustainment  Program  manpower  model  at  Hill AFB, UT is to manage the program complexity of a Republic of Bandaria DCS/FMS Hybrid  case  requiring  multiple  work  centers  to  incorporate  partner-unique  avionics components.‖ 4.7.  Releasing Draft LOA Documents. 4.7.1.  Draft  documents  may  be  provided  to  the  partner  upon  request,  provided  the coordination  has  been  reviewed  by  the  policy  office  and  any  required  congressional notifications  have  been  completed.    Only  DSAMS-produced  draft  response  documents  will be provided to the partner. 4.7.2.  If requested, a "draft" copy of an LOA can be provided to the partner at any point in the  LOA  process,  as  long  as  it  is  marked  as  a  "draft,"  and  that  it  is  not  a  formal  offer  and cannot  be  accepted  as written.   If however, the  LOA requires CN, then  a draft can only  be provided  to  the  partner  after  the  notification  is  submitted  to  Congress  and  the  transmittal number is received. 4.8.  Processing Requests for Excess Defense Articles (EDA). 4.8.1.  General. 4.8.1.1.  The  term  Excess  Defense  Article  (EDA)  is  defined  as  ―the  quantity  of  defense articles  owned  by  the  USG  which  is  in  excess  of  the  Approved  Force  Acquisition Objective  (AFAO)  and  Approved  Force  Retention  Stock  inventory  of  all  DoD components.‖  (DoD  5105.38-M,  Chapter  11).    Each  military  department  (MILDEP)  is responsible  for  ensuring  EDA  items  are  also  excess  to  other  MILDEPs,  Defense Agencies,  Reserve  Components,  and  National  Guard  before  being  proposed  for  transfer to foreign countries or international partners. 4.8.1.2.  The  AF  generally  offers  only  significant  military  equipment  (SME)  articles  to approved foreign countries as EDA.  All other AF EDA lesser items are turned in to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition Services (see paragraph 4.8.8.). 4.8.1.3.  EDA is offered at reduced cost or no cost to eligible foreign recipients on an ―as is, where is‖ basis.  EDA is priced as a percentage of original acquisition value depending on age and condition in accordance with DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 15, Chapter 7. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   67  4.8.1.4.  Each  transfer  of  EDA  requires  a  determination  by  DSCA  that  the  transfer  will not  adversely  impact  the  US  technology  and  industrial  base,  and  will  not  reduce  the opportunities  of  US  industry  to  sell  new  or  used  items  to  the  proposed  EDA  recipient partner. 4.8.1.5.  All  grant  EDA  items  transferred  by  ocean  carriers  must  follow  US  cargo preference  requirements  (Cargo  Preference  Act  of  1954,  as  Amended).    Recipient countries  must  use  US  flag  vessels  unless  a  non-availability  waiver  has  been  issued  by the  Maritime  Administration  (MARAD).    MARAD  will  assist  in  monitoring  these statutes.  Cargo preference requirements must be considered when drafting LOAs. 4.8.1.6.  The  purchaser  is  responsible  for  the  cost  of  repair,  removal  from  storage, preparation  for  flight,  movement  and  delivery,  and  any  other  expense  associated  with preparing  the  EDA  for  movement.    The  recipient  partner  normally  bears  all  packing, crating, handling, and transportation (PCH&T) costs associated with the transfer of EDA items.  The LOA must state these conditions in separate line items.  See DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 10 for exceptions to this guidance. 4.8.1.7.  Prohibited items from EDA Grant/Sales. 4.8.1.7.1.  Construction Equipment.  Section 644(g) of the FAA prohibits the transfer of  construction  equipment  (tractors,  scrapers,  loaders,  graders,  bulldozers,  dump trucks, generators, and compressors) as EDA. 4.8.1.7.2.  Firefighting Equipment.  Firefighting equipment (pumpers, fuel and water tankers, crash trucks, utility vans, rescue trucks,  ambulances, hook and ladder units, and  other  miscellaneous  firefighting  equipment)  can  be  transferred  only  if  the President  declares  an  emergency  or  if  no  other  federal  agency,  state  government, person  or  entity  eligible  to  receive  the  items  under  the  Federal  Property  and Administrative  Services  Act  of  1949  submits  a  request  for  these  items  to  the  DLA Disposition Services, who perform the appropriate screening. 4.8.1.8.  Blanket  order  EDA  cases  and/or  lines  may  be  established  only  for  non-SME consisting  of  spare  parts  and  components,  clothing,  basic  field  and  office  equipment, supplies, furniture or other non-SME items as approved by DSCA.  Blanket order cases and/or  lines  for  PCH&T  may  also  be  written  in  conjunction  with  EDA  transfers  of similar, non-SME items when the purchaser requests these services. 4.8.1.8.1.  AF EDA generally is limited to SME.  Therefore, blanket order LOAs are not applicable for AF EDA sales. 4.8.2.  EDA  Grants.    Congress  approves  the  list  of  countries  authorized  to  receive  grant EDA.  However, eligibility does not  guarantee that all EDA offers will be made on a grant basis.  Priority is given to the following countries: 4.8.2.1.  NATO  countries  on  the  southern  and  southeastern  flank  of  NATO  and  to  non-NATO allies on the southern and southeastern flank of NATO. 4.8.2.2.  Second  priority  is  given  to  countries  eligible  for  assistance  authorized  by  the NATO Participation Act of 1994. 4.8.3.  EDA Grant Process.  All FMS eligible countries may purchase EDA.   68  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 4.8.3.1.  Authority  to  grant  EDA  items  is  governed  by  Section  516  of  the  FAA.    The annual  Congressional  Presentation  for  Foreign  Operations  is  the  primary  means  for justifying EDA grant eligibility.  However, eligibility does not guarantee that all offers of EDA will be made on a grant basis.  Each transfer is considered on a case-by-case basis. 4.8.3.1.1.  The purposes for which the article(s) is provided to the partner, including whether the article(s) was previously provided to the partner. 4.8.3.1.2.  The impact on the US Forces military readiness. 4.8.3.1.3.  The impact  on the national  technology  and industrial base and the impact on opportunities of this base to sell new or used equipment to the partner. 4.8.3.1.4.  The current value and original acquisition value of the article(s). 4.8.3.1.5.  As  required,  an  estimate  of  PCH&T  funds  needed  for  transfer  of  the articles. 4.8.3.2.  Proposed grant EDA transfers require CN prior to offer. 4.8.4.  EDA Sales. 4.8.4.1.  Authority to sell EDA items is governed by Section 21 of the AECA.  All FMS eligible countries may purchase EDA. 4.8.4.1.1.  Proposed EDA sales require, as a minimum, a 15-calendar day CN prior to offer  in  accordance  with  the  Foreign  Operations,  Export  Financing  and  Related Programs  Appropriations  Act.    Proposed  sales  that  contain  SME  or  whose  original acquisition value is $7 million or more require a 30-calendar day notification (Section 516(f) of the FAA).  Notifications shall include: 4.8.4.1.1.1.  The  purposes  for  which  the  article(s)  is  provided  to  the  partner, including whether the article(s) was previously provided to the partner. 4.8.4.1.1.2.  The impact on the US Forces military readiness. 4.8.4.1.1.3.  The  impact  on  the  national  technology  and  industrial  base  and  the impact on opportunities of this base to sell new or used equipment to the partner. 4.8.4.1.1.4.  The current value and original acquisition value of the article(s). 4.8.4.1.1.5.  As required, an estimate of PCH&T funds needed for transfer of the articles to be transferred. 4.8.5.  Authorization to Offer. 4.8.5.1.  DSCA  will  notify  SAF/IA  to  officially  offer  the  EDA  items  to  the  proposed partner.    DSCA  will  assign  a  Record  Control  Number  (RCN)  for  tracking  costs  in  the DSCA 1000 system. 4.8.6.  Processing Requests for SME EDA. 4.8.6.1.  Requests for SME EDA are submitted through the appropriate SAF/IA Country Director to SAF/IAPD. 4.8.6.2.  The requestor must provide the national stock numbers (NSNs) of the requested EDA to expedite processing the request. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   69  4.8.6.3.  AFSAC  will  screen  the  requests  to  determine  the  availability  of  the  EDA  and provide  the  following  information  to  the  SAF/IA  Country  Director  with  an  information copy to SAF/IAPD: 4.8.6.3.1.  Quantity available as EDA and date available. 4.8.6.3.2.  Quantity requested. 4.8.6.3.3.  Original acquisition value(s). 4.8.6.3.4.  Condition code(s). 4.8.6.3.5.  Current transfer value(s). 4.8.6.3.6.  Storage costs. 4.8.6.3.7.  Storage location. 4.8.6.3.8.  Other costs (e.g., preparation, transportation). 4.8.6.3.9.  Other  impacts  or  limiting  factors  (e.g.,  deadline  to  move  the  items, deadline to accept the offer). 4.8.6.3.10.  The DSAMS case designator (as initiated in DSAMS by AFSAC). 4.8.6.4.  The  SAF/IA  Country  Director  will  issue  the  initial  response  to  EDA  requests within  20  days  of  receipt  of  the  requests.    Responses  should  state  which  items  are available  or  not  available  as  EDA.    If  the  requested  EDA  is  not  available  the  response should also indicate, if known, the fiscal year such items might become available. 4.8.6.4.1.  If  the  assets  are  available,  the  SAF/IA  Country  Director  will  submit  the required  information  within  30  days  to  DSCA  for  coordination,  approval,  and congressional notification prior to an official offer to the partner. 4.8.6.4.2.  If the requests exceed available assets, SAF/IAPD will submit a proposed allocation  plan  to  DSCA.    DSCA  will  convene  an  EDA  Coordinating  Committee meeting.    This  Committee,  co-chaired  by  DSCA  and  the  DoS,  with  representatives from  the  Department  of  Commerce  (DoC)  and  DoD  regional  and  functional  policy offices  recommends  the  allocation  of  EDA  to  potential  recipients.    Meeting  of  the Committee is only required when requests from countries exceed available assets. 4.8.6.5.  The  AF  cannot  offer  or  commit  EDA  to  a  recipient  partner  before  the  CN  has been completed.  The SAF/IA Country Director will prepare the data for CN on all EDA cases and submit it to DSCA even if the excess articles are being provided without cost (grant  EDA).    On  completion  of  CN,  the  SAF/IA  Country  Director  will  inform  the AFSAC EDA focal point, who will take appropriate action. 4.8.6.6.  EDA LOAs. 4.8.6.6.1.  Within  60  days  of  receiving  approval  to  offer  the  EDA  from  DSCA,  an LOA should be submitted for an EDA sale, or an LOA for PCH&T costs associated with a grant transfer.  The LOA should provide a ―drop dead‖ date by which the items must be accepted or moved.  LOAs are not used to provide EDA on a grant basis.  For grant EDA there will usually be an associated LOA for the PCH&T costs.  The LOA may  also  include  additional  equipment,  services,  and  training  in  order  to  provide  a   70  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 total package.  If no associated LOA is required for a grant EDA transfer, the SAF/IA Country Director will ensure that the partner representative completes Form DD 250, Materiel  Inspection  and  Receiving  Report  as  official  documentation  of  delivery  and acceptance of the EDA. 4.8.6.6.2.  LOAs  for  EDA  sales.    Separate  LOAs  or  LOA  line  items  containing  the following information should be initiated for EDA sales: 4.8.6.6.2.1.  Source-of-supply code E should appear in column (5) of the LOA for the EDA line(s). 4.8.6.6.2.2.  As the last words in the item description field for the EDA items, the LOA  must  state,  ―EXCESS  DEFENSE  ARTICLES.    Acquisition  value  is $_____.‖ 4.8.6.6.2.3.  The following LOA NOTE should be added. 4.8.6.6.2.3.1.  ―LOA  NOTE  #___  EXCESS  DEFENSE  ARTICLES‖.  ―Equipment in line items ______ is offered in ―as is, where is‖ condition and may not meet serviceability standards normally prescribed by the US military for  sale  to  security  assistance  purchasers.    Items  may  be  missing  basic  issue items  and accessories;  may be in  excess  of hour/mileage standards; and  may not  have  applicable  publications/records.    Acceptance  of  this  Letter  of  Offer and Acceptance (LOA) does not imply or commit the USG to accept separate requests for rehabilitative services, supply of shortages, future supportability, or  training.    These  services  will  be  provided  only  if  available  within  the resources of the US military at the time a request is made by the purchaser and at  the  purchaser’s  expense.    Standard  Form  364  cannot  be  submitted  against the equipment in line items ___.‖ 4.8.6.6.3.  LOAs Associated with Grant EDA. 4.8.6.6.4.  LOAs  are  not  used  to  transfer  Grant  EDA;  however,  there  can  be  an associated  LOA for the transfer of PCH&T  costs.  Such services, defined  as above-the-line charges, are based on the item acquisition value in accordance with the DoD 7000.14-R,  Chapter  7.    These  LOAs  may  also  include  additional  equipment  and services  (e.g.,  refurbishment,  publications,  training)  to  provide  a  total  package approach.  Since the EDA items do not appear as an LOA line, the following note and attachment should be added to the LOA. 4.8.6.6.5.  ―LOA NOTE #___ EDA PCH&T COST‖.  ―This LOA provides funds for packing,  crating,  handling,  and  transportation  (PCH&T)  of  the  equipment  listed  in Attachment 1, which is being provided on a grant basis under the Foreign Assistance Act  of  1961,  Section  516.    Attachment  1  equipment  is  offered  in  ―as  is,  where  is‖ condition  and  may  not  meet  serviceability  standards  normally  prescribed  by  the  US military for sale to security assistance purchasers.  Items may be missing basic issue items and accessories; may be in excess of hour/mileage standards; and may not have applicable  publications/records.    Acceptance  of  this  Letter  of  Offer  and  Acceptance (LOA)  does  not  imply  or  commit  the  USG  to  accept  separate  requests  for rehabilitative  services,  supply  of  shortages,  future  supportability,  or  training.    These services will be provided only if available within the resources of the US military at AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   71  the  time  a  request  is  made  by  the  purchaser  and  at  the  purchaser’s  expense.    Any Standard Form 364 submitted against this LOA is limited to services provided under the case and cannot be submitted against the materiel listed on Attachment 1.‖ 4.8.6.6.6.  Attachment 1 to the LOA must contain the following EDA information: 4.8.6.6.6.1.  Item/Nomenclature. 4.8.6.6.6.2.  Quantity. 4.8.6.6.6.3.  Acquisition Cost. 4.8.6.6.6.4.  Current Value. 4.8.6.6.6.5.  Location. 4.8.6.6.7.  If  a  grant  EDA  does  not  have  an  associated  LOA,  then  the  implementing agency is required to complete a Materiel Inspection and Receiving Report (DD 250 or equivalent) as official documentation of delivery. 4.8.6.6.8.  LOA Note for Storage Charges.  If storage charges are included, they must be clearly stated in an LOA note (see example below): 4.8.6.6.8.1.  ―LOA NOTE #___ STORAGE CHARGES‖.  ―If the Government of ____________ does not arrange to remove the materiel at Attachment 1 within 60 days  after  implementation  of  the  LOA,  a  storage  charge  will  be  determined  by applying  1.5  percent  annually  (.125  percent  monthly)  against  the  original acquisition  value  of  the  materiel.    Storage  charges  will  commence  with  the materiel release order date.  These costs will be recouped by adding a storage line to this LOA via modification.‖ 4.8.7.  Joint Visual Inspection (JVI).  Recipient countries are encouraged to perform a JVI of  the  EDA  materiel  condition  before  accepting  it.    Except  for  DLA  Disposition  Services items,  JVIs  will  not  occur  prior  to  transfer  approval  unless  DSCA/P3-PPD  has  granted  an exception.    A  blanket  exception  is  granted  for  DLA  Disposition  Services  items,  due  to  the nature  of  the  DLA  Disposition  Services  disposal  procedures,  which  allow  for  physical screening of the items. 4.8.8.  DLA  Disposition  Services  Transfers.  Matches of partner needs and MILDEP-held excesses  are  usually  limited  to  SME  items,  therefore,  other  AF  EDA,  including  secondary items,  are  transferred  to  DLA  Disposition  Services  when  they  become  excess.    DLA Disposition Services -held EDA are listed on the DLA web page https://www.drms.dla.mil/ and  a  computerized  inventory  searching  service  is  provided  to  provide  information  on  all stock-numbered  items  in  the  DLA  Disposition  Services  inventory.    To  purchase  items through  DLA  Disposition  Services,  interested  parties  should  establish  an  FMS  case  with DLA.  This can be done on-line via an email (FMS@drms.dla.mil) or by sending an LOR to DRMS/FMS, Battle Creek, MI.  DLA will provide instructions on requisitioning procedures once the partner has established the DLA Disposition Services /FMS case. 4.9.  Returning Reparable Articles Under the FMS Repair Program. 4.9.1.  AFMAN 23-110, Volume 9 contains procedures for FMS materiel returned for repair or replacement.   72  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 4.10.  Sole-Source Requests. 4.10.1.  Partners  may  request  that  a  specific  contractor  source  be  designated  to  provide specific  articles  and  services.    The  request  must  be  made  in  writing  and  include  the contractor's  name,  specific  items  and  services,  the  basis  and  adequate  justification  for  the sole-source requirement, and should preferably cite the applicable DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 6, paragraphs C6.3.4 through C6.3.5 provisions.   Sole-source requests must accompany the LOR.   Note:  USG personnel  may not  solicit sole-source requests from  potential countries.  Once  a  partner  decides  to  submit  a  sole-source  request,  USG  representatives  must  remain objective  in  providing  options  to  the  partner  and  cannot  recommend  one  contractor  over another. 4.10.2.  All  sole source-approving authorities, SAF/IA, AFSAC and AETC/IA, must ensure potential sole source contractors and vendors undergo a vetting process in order to ensure the partner’s  choice  can  successfully  meet  the  requirements  for  their  respective  security assistance  programs.    The  responsible  organization  for  processing  FMS  cases  with  sole source requests will obtain assessments from the procurement sources that address potential risks associated with application/integration and obsolescence issues.  A written request from the  partner  is  required  to  continue  processing  the  sole  source.    If  there  are  significant performance  issues,  the  responsible  organization  will  develop  a  sole  source  denial  package and forward to SAF/IAPX for processing. 4.10.3.  A partner’s sole-source request that has an electronic signature or that is transmitted via e-mail,  fax, or form  letter may be accepted as valid.  Partners are  encouraged to  utilize letterhead stationary to transmit sole source requests.  CCMs are responsible for ensuring that the partner’s requesting official has authority to request sole-source items or services. 4.10.4.  Any  information  or  supporting  documentation  must  be  provided  with  the  request.  An FMS case will be initialized in DSAMS prior to submitting the request for approval.  The case  identifier  must  be  annotated  in  the  request.    If  the  request  contains  incomplete  data elements  or  insufficient  justification,  the  USG  representative  (SAF/IA  Country  Director, CCM, SCO) should return the request to the partner for resubmission 4.10.4.1.  The CM, CCM and SAPM must ensure that the purchaser is aware of the need to have sustainment cases in place to avoid lapses in AF support. 4.10.5.  SCO  responsibilities.    To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  the  SCO  will  review  the sole-source requests, advise the partner about needed changes, and subsequently forward the request with any necessary comments or recommendations to the appropriate CCM. 4.10.6.  LOA  Processing  Activity  Responsibilities.    Upon  receipt  of  a  sole-source  request from a purchaser, the CCM will accomplish the following: 4.10.6.1.  Review  the  request  against  the  criteria  in  DoD  5105.38-M,  Chapter  6, Paragraph C6.3.4 through C6.3.5. 4.10.6.2.  Obtain risk information from the Program Manager related to the complexity of the  acquisition  (not  the  perceived  capabilities  of  a  specific  contractor),  if  risk  has  been identified,  forward  the  information  to  the  partner  along  with  advice  that  associated increased  costs  and  lead-times  may  result  with  sole  source  and  that  competitive procurement  is  recommended.    A  written  request  from  the  partner  (to  include AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   73  acknowledgement  that  the  USG  does  not  vouch  for  or  guarantee  the  performance  of  a requested  contractor  and  that  the  partner  bears  all  risk  of  cost  increases  or  schedule extensions) is required to continue processing the sole source. 4.10.6.3.  Obtain  contractor  performance/delivery  information  from  the  Contractor Performance  Assessment  Reporting  System  (CPARS)  and  an  assessment  from  the procurement source regarding the contractor’s past performance and ability to deliver on schedule.    If  there  are  significant  performance  issues,  then  staffing  for  a  DSCA  sole source  denial  should  proceed,  with  further  processing  to  be  placed  on  hold  pending DSCA decision. 4.10.6.4.  Prepare a cover letter that endorses the purchaser’s request and send the request package  through  appropriate  channels  for  coordination  if  the    request  meets  criteria  in DoD  5105.38-M  and  it  is  not  stopped  due  to  application  of  paragraph  4.11.6.2  or paragraph 4.11.6.3. 4.10.6.5.  Return the request to the purchaser if the request does not meet the criteria in DoD 5105.38-M or it was stopped due to application of paragraph 4.11.6.2 or paragraph 4.11.6.3. 4.10.7.  Approval Authority.  AFSAC/CC or AFSAC/CV; or AFSAC/CA (in the absence of both  AFSAC/CC  and  AFSAC/CV)  is  the  approval  authority  for  all  FMS  purchasers’  sole-source requests written and managed by AFSAC.  AETC/IA is the approval authority for all FMS  cases  written  and  managed  by  AFSAT.    This  authority  may  not  be  further  delegated, unless otherwise approved in writing by SAF/ IA. 4.10.7.1.  When a request is determined to be militarily or politically sensitive, forward to SAF/IAPX for review and approval. 4.10.8.  Disapprovals.   All  proposed  recommendations  for  disapproval  of  FMS  sole-source purchaser requests must be processed to SAF/IAPX for review, recommendation of approval, return,  or  disapproval.    SAF/IAPX  will  coordinate  all  formal  sole-source  disapprovals  with DSCA per DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 6, Paragraph C6.3.4, subparagraph C6.3.4.4. 4.11.  Coordination and distribution of FMS cases. 4.11.1.  Attachment  4  lists  mandatory  coordination  requirements  for  all  LOAs  and  Leases.  LOAs and Leases must undergo guidance and financial reviews prior to MILDEP signature.  Legal review occurs at the final completion of the LOA at DSCA/OPS/CWD.  These reviews determine the  adequacy  of the document under existing laws and  regulations, including the AECA,  DoD  directives,  Standard  Terms  and  Conditions,  and  the  Federal  Acquisition Regulation  (FAR).    Further,  they  consider  pricing,  nonrecurring  cost  recoupment  charges, etc.,  as  well  as  possible  impacts  to  administrative  funding  requirements  due  to  increased workload. 4.11.2.  Attachment  8  lists  the  minimum  coordination  required  for  security  assistance documents. 4.12.  Changes to FMS Cases. 4.12.1.  Pen-and-Ink Changes.  Once a case is written and coordinated by the Air Force and has  been  countersigned  by  DSCA,  it  is  in  "offered"  status.    Pen-and-ink  changes  may  be made to offered LOAs and LOA Amendments in accordance with DoD 5105.38-M.   74  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 4.12.1.1.  Pen-and-ink changes are not permitted on LOA Modification documents. 4.12.1.2.  Pen-and-ink  changes  must  be  minor  in  nature  and  must  be  completed  on  or before  the  OED.    If  the  required  changes  are  not  minor  in  nature,  the  case  should  be "restated."  The preamble will clearly identify that the document is a restated version, to include which document was superseded, and the specific changes included. 4.12.1.3.  Pen-and-ink changes must be distributed using the LOA distribution list. 4.12.1.4.  Pen-and-ink changes will be kept to a minimum.  Minor changes may include insignificant  technical  corrections  such  as  a  small  arithmetic  change,  which  does  not increase the total  value.  Minor changes may include administrative changes such as an address  correction,  OED  extensions/reinstatements,  initial  deposit  or  payment  schedule adjustment, or minor changes to wording. 4.12.1.5.  Unauthorized pen and ink changes.  When an LOA is signed by the purchaser and  returned  to  the  implementing  agency  with  unauthorized  pen  and  ink  changes,  it  is processed as a counteroffer.  The LOA should be restated and reoffered, or cancelled and a new LOA prepared. 4.12.2.  Prior to finalizing the LOA, the CCM and CM will ensure SAPM has reviewed the final LOA, particularly the payment plan.  The CCM usually will send the final LOA to the appropriate  SCO/ODC  and  partner  representative.    SAF/IA  will  provide  the  LOA  to  the partner for significant LORs or when requested. 4.12.3.  Reinstatements of Offer.  There may be times when major changes need to made to a  document  after  it  has  been  countersigned  and  offered  to  the  purchaser.    If  the  purchaser wants to retain the exiting designator (instead of canceling the offer and issuing a new case), the offered case may be restated.  Restatements can be made as long as:  the document is in ―offered‖ status, the purchaser has not yet signed the case, the OED has not yet expired, and all changes  are  consistent with  FMS policies and procedures.  Restated documents must  be coordinated  and  countersigned  using  the  same  procedures  as  the  original  case.    Restated documents  must  clearly  state  that  they  are  restated  and  supersede  the  previously  offered version. 4.12.3.1.  Extensions to the OED must be requested and granted prior to the OED, or the offer will terminate.  If the OED has passed, but the purchaser desires to accept, the case may be reinstated if the following conditions are met. 4.12.3.1.1.  There is insufficient time to prepare a new LOA. 4.12.3.1.2.  The pricing data are still valid. 4.12.3.1.3.  The extension granted on a reinstatement is for immediate signature, but may  be  for  as  long  as  the  pricing  data  will  be  valid.    Other  changes,  if  minor  in nature, may be accomplished at the time the case is reinstated. 4.12.3.2.  A reinstatement may be accomplished using a pen-and-ink change as outlined in paragraph 4.12.1. 4.12.4.  Amendments and Modifications.  Once the purchaser has signed the LOA, the case is  in  "accepted"  status.    After  DFAS-IN/JAX  receives  the  required  initial  deposit,  the  case will  be  in  "implemented"  status.    Pen-and-ink  changes  are  not  authorized  for  accepted  or AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   75  implemented documents.  After the document has been accepted and implemented, changes can  only  be  made  by  preparing  an  Amendment  or  Modification  (described  in  the  next chapter). 4.13.  Standard Security Assistance Files. 4.13.1.  CMs  must maintain  standard  files within their areas of responsibility in  accordance with  Air  Force  Records  Information  Management  System  (AFRIMS)  Records  Disposition Schedule  (RDS) in https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.cfm.   76  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 Chapter 5 FMS CASE PERFORMANCE 5.1.  Case Acceptance. 5.1.1.  A  Letter  of  Offer  and  Acceptance  (LOA)  or  an  LOA  for  an  Amendment  cannot  be implemented until all of the following conditions are met: 5.1.1.1.  An authorized representative of the partner signs the document on or before the expiration date and completes the information at the bottom of the first page of the LOA.  This  includes  the  Mark  for  Code,  Freight  Forwarder  Code,  partner’s  Procuring  Agency Code and Name and Address of the partner’s paying office. 5.1.1.2.  If  the  terms  of  the  LOA  state  "Cash  with  Acceptance"  or  "Initial  Deposit,"  a check  is  deposited  with  the  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service,  Indianapolis Center, Security Cooperation Accounting (DFAS-IN/JAX), or a wire transfer is made to the  United  States  Government  (USG).    If  the  partner's  funds  are  on  deposit  at  DFAS-IN/JAX  (a  trust  fund  account),  these  funds  may  be  used  in  place  of  a  check  or  a  wire transfer,  if  written  authority  is  attached  to  the  accepted  offer  or  sent  to  DFAS-IN/JAX before the expiration date. 5.1.1.3.  The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Comptroller receives notice of acceptance within 10 calendar days of the LOA expiration date. 5.1.1.4.  DFAS-IN/JAX  and the issuing Air  Force (AF) agency  each receive one signed copy of the LOA before expiration. 5.1.1.5.  Written  authority  is  provided,  as  directed  by  the  LOA,  if  option  lines  are included on the LOA. 5.1.1.6.  There are no partner conditions or counter offers to the acceptance. 5.2.  Case Implementation. 5.2.1.  The AF will implement security assistance programs in the same manner as other AF programs as much as possible.  Certain functions, however, are not inherent in Department of Defense  (DoD)  and  AF  programs,  such  as  support  of  foreign  policy,  direct  dealings  with foreign  representatives,  training  of  personnel  using  English  as  a  second  language,  and  the placement  of  Unite  States  (US)  assets  into  foreign-controlled  and  operated  environments.  These differences must be recognized, and standard AF practices modified when required. 5.2.2.  Case  Implementation  occurs  after  country  acceptance  (signature)  and  receipt  of  the required initial deposit.  The FMS case must be implemented in all applicable data systems (e.g.,  Defense  Security  Assistance  Management  System  (DSAMS),  Defense  Integrated Financial  System  (DIFS),  and  the  Case  Management  Control  System  (CMCS))  before  case execution begins. 5.2.3.  International Program Directive (IPD). 5.2.3.1.  The  Case  Manager  (CM)  is  responsible  for  issuing  an  IPD  directing  the applicable AF Command or agency to implement one or more line items of an FMS case.  The  IPD  should  be  sent  to  the  implementing  agency  within  five  workdays  of  case AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   77  implementation.    The  implementing  agency  may,  in  turn,  delegate  line  management responsibility by internal written direction. 5.2.3.2.  Implementing  agencies  must  not  take  implementing  action  (e.g.,  delivering articles,  performing  in-house  services,  or  contracting  for  an  article  or  service)  until  the IPD is received and the obligation authority (OA) is approved.  If OA is not yet approved when the IPD is issued, the CM will notify the Line Managers when OA is approved and lines may be implemented. 5.2.3.3.  If the CM makes changes to the LOA data (LOAD) submitted by implementing activities, the IPD will specifically identify these changes.  All pen-and-ink changes and restatements to the LOA must be attached to the IPD.  An IPD cannot exceed the scope of the LOA, and all acquisition action must be within the scope of the IPD. 5.2.3.4.  IPDs  identify  all  lines  that  include  non-recurring  cost  recoupment  charges (NRC). 5.2.3.5.  Line Managers must provide IPD information regarding NRCs to the accounting activities responsible for monitoring these charges. 5.2.3.6.  The CM can control the release of the OA by limiting the total amount of funds available on a line item of the LOA.  The withholding of the OA will only be used on an exception  basis  (usually  with  the  concurrence  of  the  Security  Assistance  Program Manager  (SAPM)  and  the  Line  Manager)  and  must  be  identified  in  the  IPD.    The  IPD may also require the Line Manager to report commitments at a percentage level (e.g., 80 percent or 90 percent). 5.2.3.7.  The  implementing  agency  must  tell  the  partner  when  an  FMS  case  has  been received for implementation, and must provide the address at which it may be contacted for routine matters or for technical information. 5.2.4.  IPD Amendments.  IPD amendments implement all changes to LOAs (modifications and  amendments)  and  other  security  assistance  documents.    IPD  amendments  may  also provide internal instructions not contained in a formal modification or amendment. 5.3.  Management Reviews. 5.3.1.  Every  effort  will  be  made  to  plan,  coordinate,  and  conduct  AF-sponsored  foreign military sales (FMS) reviews in an efficient, responsive manner that conserves both AF and partner resources. 5.3.2.  AF offices of primary responsibility (OPRs) for planning and chairing AF-sponsored FMS reviews should use common sense to adhere to the following general guidelines, while also accommodating partner FMS review expectations or requests: 5.3.2.1.  Determine  that  each  review  has  a  defined  objective  and  a  desirable  outcome before the review is scheduled. 5.3.2.2.  Reduce the number of reviews to the extent possible. 5.3.2.3.  Limit the number of USG attendees at FMS reviews to the extent possible, while ensuring that the reviews themselves are conducted in an effective and efficient manner.   78  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 5.3.2.4.  Ensure that each USG attendee at FMS reviews has a distinct and active role, is fully prepared and knowledgeable, and is empowered to make decisions. 5.3.2.5.  Subscribe to the FMS review funding guidelines. 5.3.2.6.  Standardize preparation and follow-on requirements. 5.4.  Amendments and Modifications. 5.4.1.  Once  an  LOA  has  been  implemented,  Amendments  and  Modifications  are  used  to document  program  changes  during  the  life  of  the  case.    These  changes  may  include  price changes, schedule adjustments, scope changes, shifting funds, source of supply adjustments, etc.  An Amendment is necessary when a change requires partner acceptance.  The scope of the  case  is  a  key  issue  to  consider  in  deciding  whether  to  prepare  an  Amendment, Modification or a new LOA.  A scope change takes place when the original purpose of a case line or note changes.  This may be reflected through either an increase or decrease in dollar value, quantity, or lead-time.  Major increases in scope normally require the preparation of a new  LOA  vice  an  Amendment  or  Modification.    DoD  5105.38-M,  Security  Assistance Management  Manual  (SAMM), Chapter 6 provides examples of scope  changes that may be done using a Modification or Amendment. 5.4.2.  Requests  for  adjustments  are  prepared  by  Line  Managers  in  the  implementing command and sent through the SAPM to the CM.  Requests for changes must be sent using the  format  in  Figure  5-1.    Note:    Line  items  and  dollar  values  provided  are  for  sample purposes only. Figure 5.1.  Sample LOA Amendment/Modification Change Request   5.4.3.  The  name,  office  symbol,  and  telephone  number  of  the  Line  Manager  and  the Financial  Manager  providing  the  cost  adjustment  verification  to  the  Line  Manager,  and  the source documents for the funding adjustment must be listed. 5.4.4.  The CM will not process the request without all of the above information.  After the information  has  been  furnished,  the  CM  shows  all  changes  (availability,  source  of  supply, cost changes, etc.) on an LOA Amendment or Modification.  Any proposed cost changes that would  reduce  the  LOA  line  item  value  below  the  OA,  obligations,  commitments, expenditures, or deliveries in the Case Management Control System (CMCS) are referred to the Line Manager for resolution. 5.5.  Procurement from Sources Outside the US (Offshore Procurement). 5.5.1.  When the USG-contracting officer procures from an offshore source, the articles must be  moved  to  the  continental  US  (CONUS)  freight  forwarder  or  partner  representative  as LineCurrent Availability/Revised Availability/CurrentCostRevisedItem   Source of Supply Source of Supply Line ValueChangeCost003P(24)No Change$55,000+$1,000$56,000005P(12)X(12)$  2,000-$    326$  1,674007P(12)P(15)$  1,000No Change$  1,000AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   79  shown by the Freight Forwarder Code in the LOA.  As an exception to guidance, the partner may authorize: 5.5.1.1.  A freight forwarder, authorized to do business in the country where the offshore contractor  is  located,  to  arrange  transportation  from  the  offshore  contractor's  facility  to the partner. 5.5.1.2.  A representative to arrange transportation from the offshore contractor's facility to the partner. 5.5.1.3.  The  freight  forwarder/implementing  agency  to  amend  the  current  DSP-94  to decrease  the  exportable  value  of  the  case  by  the  acquisition  price  of  the  off-shore procurements. 5.5.2.  The  Line  Manager  will  notify  the  partner  of  articles  to  be  procured  offshore  by  the contract award date.  The Line Manager's notice must state that the articles will be moved to the  CONUS  freight  forwarder,  unless  the  partner  requests  delivery  of  the  articles  at  the offshore contractor's facility.  The partner’s request must be made within 20 calendar days of the offshore procurement notification date. 5.5.3.  Section  42(c)  of  the  Arms  Export  Control  Act  (AECA),  specifies  restrictions  on offshore procurement if credit or grant funding is used. 5.6.  Insurance for FMS Materiel. 5.6.1.  Partners  who  require  insurance  should  obtain  coverage  from  a  commercial  source; however,  if  this  is  not  possible,  a  request  may  be  initiated  to  the  appropriate  Command Country Manager (CCM) for coverage to be included in the LOA at the partner’s expense. 5.6.1.1.  The  request  must  state  why  the  partner  cannot  obtain  insurance  from  a commercial source and must designate the AF as the partner’s agent.  This allows the AF to  obtain  insurance  quotes  and  to  purchase  insurance  coverage.    The  request  should identify the articles or services to be insured and the coverage needed. 5.6.2.  Insurance is entered on the LOA as a separate line item.  LOAs that include insurance coverage must specify in the line item description the lines covered. 5.7.  Required Availability Date (RAD). 5.7.1.  The required  availability date (RAD) is  the number of months  from  the date of  case implementation, that the requested item will be available for release to the partner.  It is used to help the AF meet delivery commitments to the partner for system activation.  It also gives dates for the support of end-items of AF origin. 5.7.2.  On  defined-order  cases,  place  the  RAD  on  AF-generated  requisitions  in  routing positions (RP) 63 and 64.  It does not  apply to requisitions made under blanket order cases (e.g., ―K‖, ―R‖, and ―E‖ cases), or blanket order lines on ―N‖, ―Q‖ or ―S‖ cases.  AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volumes 1, 3, and 9 contain details for RAD control. 5.7.3.  When  an  RAD  cannot  be  met,  the  partner  must  be  informed  of  the  new  estimated delivery  date.    The  notice  is  provided  in  a  Military  Standard  Requisitioning  and  Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) status transaction.    80  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 5.8.  Not-Mission-Capable Supply (NMCS) and Other Priority Requests. 5.8.1.  Priority  requirements  for  spares  are  filled  from  blanket  order  cases  (―K‖  or  ―R‖),  or blanket  order  lines  on  ―N‖,  ―Q‖,  or  ―S‖  cases.    NMCS  requirements  for  spares  are  sent  by priority requisition, based on force activity designator (FAD) and urgency-of-need designator (UND), for the exact quantity.  A partner may need an item already on requisition and may not want to buy an alternate item.  In this case, the priority of the item or requisition may be upgraded  and  identified  as  NMCS.    The  partner's  records  are  updated  by  status  reports provided automatically from the AF supply system. 5.8.2.  Priority  requirements  for  cartridge-activated  devices  and  propellant-actuated  devices (CAD/PAD) are filled using ―C‖ cases, or a ―C‖ type line on a ―Q‖ or ―S‖ case.  If the item is a  priority  and  not  on  the  ―C‖  case  and  additional  funds  have  not  been  provided  for emergencies,  the  case  may  be  amended  to  add  the  emergency  need.    A  partner  may  order urgently-needed CAD/PAD items by sending a message to the Air Force Security Assistance Center  (AFSAC),  stating  the  exact  quantity  needed  to  meet  the  NMCS  condition.    The message must also include the item description, aircraft serial number, and the accepted "C" case for delivery and billing. 5.8.3.  Partners  should  submit  a  new  NMCS  requisition  with  an  UND  ―A‖  and  a  Required Delivery Date (RDD) ―NAA‖, if the existing requisition is in BZ/BV status (which cannot be changed  with  a  modification).    If  the  current  requisition  is  in  ―BB‖  status  then  send  a MILSTRIP  cancellation  (AC_)  for  the  non-NMCS  quantity  and  also  send  a  requisition modifier  (AM_)  to  change  the  UND  to  ―A‖  and  the  RDD  to  ―NAA‖.    The  partner  should follow-up with a telecom/email to the Supply Source when these actions are implemented.  If the  requisition  is  for  a  ―ship-to‖  designation  that  is  not  coded  in  the  MAPAD,  then  a  new ―Exception  Data  Requisition‖  must  be  entered  with  the  ―clear-text‖  address    to  eliminate delays and misrouting of the materiel. 5.9.  Partner Follow-up Actions. 5.9.1.  The  partner  uses  MILSTRIP  for  follow-up  actions  on  an  item-by-item  basis  (see AFMAN  23-110).    Administrative  actions  may  be  sent  by  message  or  letter.    The  partner may  also  register  for  access  to  Security  Assistance  Management  Information  System (SAMIS), AFSAC On-Line and the DSCA Security Cooperation  Information  Portal (SCIP) to  facilitate  entering  new  requisitions,  cancellations,  and  modifications  on  existing requisitions. 5.10.  FMS Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). 5.10.1.  The  DoD  requires  a  high  level  of  quality  control  on  FMS  shipments  and documentation. The AF must give prompt attention to a partner's questions and make every effort  to  find  a  fair  solution.    Active  programs  are  maintained  for  funding,  analyzing,  and ending  discrepancies.    Joint  Service  publication  AFJMAN  23-215,  Reporting  of  Supply Discrepancies  outlines  DoD  policy  and  procedures  for  processing  SDRs  against  security assistance  shipments.    Supplementation  is  permitted.    AFMAN  23-110,  Volume  9  contains AF policy and procedures for SDRs. 5.10.2.  Partner Responsibilities.  When receiving FMS articles, partners should: AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   81  5.10.2.1.  Instruct their freight forwarders to ensure that supporting AF documentation is included in the shipment to the incountry address. 5.10.2.2.  Carefully inspect materiel against shipping documentation and duein records. 5.10.2.3.  Pay special attention to partial and consolidated shipments. 5.10.3.  SDRs.  Standard Form (SF) 364, Report of Discrepancy is used to report deficiencies or other discrepancies in shipping, packaging, services, billings, and product quality relating to  security  assistance  shipments.    All  SF  364s  and  substantiating  documentation  must  be forwarded  to  the  SDR  Division  (AFSAC/IARGB)  within  the  timeframes  established  in  the LOA.  SF 364 is the source for financial adjustments to the partner for approved SDRs. 5.10.3.1.  AFSAC responsibilities with regard to SDRs.  AFSAC performs the following tasks relating to the processing of SDRs: 5.10.3.1.1.  Approves  SDRs administrative (admin) funds. less than  $50,000.00 to  be  settled  with  FMS 5.10.3.1.2.  Controls each SDR. 5.10.3.1.3.  Sends the SDR to the proper agency for causative research. 5.10.3.1.4.  Verifies credit or debit determinations made by AF activities. 5.10.3.1.5.  Makes sure credits or debits are made to the correct FMS case. 5.10.3.1.6.  Obtains  Air  Force  Materiel  Command  (AFMC)  legal  opinion  prior  to forwarding SDR to the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force/International Affairs, Security  Assistance  Policy  and  International  Training  &  Education  Division (SAF/IAPX). 5.10.3.1.7.  Advises DFAS-IN/JAX of the authorized credit for final adjustment to the partner's holding account, if an SDR is approved after the case is closed. 5.10.3.1.8.  Maintains  SDR  records  by  partner,  international  organization,  agency category, and dollar value. 5.10.3.1.9.  Makes  recommendations  for  improving  SDR  processing  procedures  and supply operations. 5.10.3.1.10.  Submits  management  evaluation  reports  required  by  AFJMAN  23-215 to SAF/IAPX. 5.10.3.2.  Billing or financial discrepancies.  Billing errors include those where materiel is  received  as  ordered  (and  with  proper  accompanying  documentation),  but  billings  per individual shipment are incorrectly reflected, omitted, or duplicated in either the security assistance  delivery  listing  or  billing  statement.    Financial  discrepancies  include  those where  an  incorrect  admin  or  below-the-line  accessorial  charge  appears  on  the  partner’s billing statement. 5.10.3.3.  Damaged or improperly packaged shipment.  Damaged or improperly packaged shipments  include  shipments  that  are  received  in  a  damaged  condition  because  of improper preservation, packing, marking, unitization, handling, transportation, or storage.   82  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 5.10.3.4.  Unserviceable  items.   Unserviceable  items  are  defective,  reparable,  or incomplete  items  shipped  in  a  condition  unfit  for  immediate  use.    These  items  may  be restored  to  serviceable  condition  by  repair,  rework,  overhaul,  or  by  the  addition  of components.    Claims  for  reimbursement  must  include  a  copy  of  the  approved  SDR authorizing  the  repairs.    The  AF  is  not  responsible  for  costs  of  repairing  damaged  or unserviceable articles, unless such repairs were approved through an SDR action. 5.10.3.5.  Item  overages.    An  overage  occurs  when  the  quantity  of  items  received  is greater  than  the  quantity  ordered  or  reflected  on  the  shipping  document.    This  does  not include  requisitioned  quantities  that  are  adjusted  by  the  source  of  supply  to  conform  to standard unit pack or minimum quantities specified by contracts. 5.10.3.6.  Item shortages.  A shortage occurs when the quantity received is less than the quantity shown on the shipping document.  To determine whether a shortage exists (and before  submitting  the  SF  364),  the  partner  should  verify  that  the  carrier  or  freight forwarder did not receive expected materiel. 5.10.3.7.  Duplicate shipments.   A duplicate shipment occurs when materiel of a certain quantity is shipped and billed under the same document number and in the same quantity as materiel previously sent. 5.10.3.8.  Erroneous shipments.  An erroneous shipment is either a misdirected shipment or an incorrect item. 5.10.3.8.1.  A  misdirected  shipment  is  a  delivery  to  a  destination  other  than  the consignee on the shipping document. 5.10.3.8.2.  An  incorrect  item  may  be  one  received  in  place  of  a  requisitioned  item due  to  shipper  error,  and  not  an  intended  substitute  or  interchangeable  item.    An incorrect  item  may  also  be  an  unauthorized  substitute  item  or  a  substitute  item intentionally  sent  despite  the  fact  that  the  requisition  prohibited  such  substitution (advice codes "2B" or "2J"). 5.10.3.9.  Non-receipt of materiel.   If a partner is billed for an item not received and no receipt  record  can  be  found,  the  partner  should  check  with  the  freight  forwarder  before submitting the SF 364 to make sure the materiel was not received or is not in transit. 5.10.3.10.  Credit for items returned.  Credit is given after the shipping activity receives proof of turnin.  Credit must be given within 60 days from the date the partner provides evidence  of  materiel  turn-in.    To  obtain  credit  for  materiel  returned  to  the  USG,  the partner must provide a copy of the DD Form 13481A, Issue Release/Receipt Document, showing a USG representative's signature. 5.10.3.11.  Contested  SDRs.    For  reconsideration  of  a  denied  SDR,  the  partner  may resubmit  a  request  within  45  days  of  the  date  of  the  first  denial.    If  the  partner  is unsatisfied with the disapproval of the second SDR, the SDR is considered unresolved or contested.  The contested SDR, with any additional documentation, must be received by AFSAC/IARGB within 45 days of the second SDR response date.  Contested SDRs with supporting documentation are forwarded to SAF/IAPX for final resolution. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   83  5.10.3.12.  SDRs  in  excess  of $50,000.  Resolution of SDRs  in  excess  of $50,000 to  be settled  with  FMS  admin  funds  must  be  forwarded  to  SAF/IAPX  for  resolution.    The following procedures apply: 5.10.3.12.1.  AFSAC/IARGB  forwards  a  request  to  SAF/IAPX  recommending  the use of FMS admin funds to settle the SDR (in accordance with (IAW) DoD 5105.38-M); only when USG liability is certain. 5.10.3.12.2.  SAF/IAPX reviews the SDR and coordinates with the Office of the Air Force General Counsel, International Affairs (SAF/GCI) for an AF legal opinion and Assistant Secretary of the Air Force/Financial Management and Comptroller, Deputy Assistant  Secretary  for  Budget,  Directorate  of  Budget  Management  and  Execution, Assistant  for  Security  Assistance  (SAF/FMBMS)  for  a  financial  review.    These organizations coordinate to determine USG liability and formulate recommendations. 5.10.3.12.3.  SAF/IAPX  forwards  the  AF  recommendation  to  DSCA  for  final disposition. 5.10.3.12.4.  If  DSCA  approves  the  claim,  SAF/IAPX  requests  a  certificate  of disposition  be provided before the  case is  credited and notifies SAF/FMBMS of the pending claim. 5.10.3.12.5.  If  SAF/GCI  or  DSCA  do  not  confirm  USG  liability  or  deny  the  use  of FMS  admin  funds,  the  SDR  is  returned  to  AFSAC/IARGB  for  compliance  with  the SAF/GCI or DSCA instructions. 5.10.3.13.  SDRs  are  processed  only  when  the  estimated  value  is  $200  or  greater regardless  of  the  type  of  discrepancy.    The  minimum  dollar  value  of  $200  or  greater includes the cost of the item plus any transportation and handling costs. 5.10.3.14.  Deficiency report(DR) submission.  DRs, as defined in TO 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution are only investigated when required by  an  LOA.    The  Technical  Coordination  Program  (TCP)  and  International  Engine Management  Program  (IEMP)  are  the  central  points  of  contact  for  investigating, analyzing  and  resolving  DRs.    Countries  not  participating  in  either  the  TCP  or  IEMP must file a SDR for resolution. 5.11.  Notice of Supply and Service Completion (NSSC). 5.11.1.  The  closure  process  of  an  FMS  case  begins  when  all  ordered  materiel  has  been physically  delivered  and  services  performed,  when  no  orders  have  been  placed  against  an open  blanket  order  case  for  180  days,  and  when  the  FMS  partner  has  confirmed  that  no orders are forthcoming.  Closure is then initiated with the NSSC letter.  The letter is prepared by  the  Line  Manager,  CM,  or,  when  appropriate,  the  CCM.    The  letter  informs  the  foreign partner and when applicable, the CM or the CCM, that all deliveries for a given case/line are complete. 5.11.2.  If  the  case/line  is  for  a  personnel  requirement,  the  Line  Manager  must  state  on  the NSSC that personnel will no longer be used to support the case/line.  A copy of the NSSC is sent to the major command (MAJCOM) manpower office.    84  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 5.12.  Case Closure. 5.12.1.  Two  methods  are  available  to  close  a  case:    accelerated  case  closure  (ACC)  (for participating  partners)  and  standard  case  closure  (for  partners  who  do  not  participate  in ACC).  ACC allows a case to be closed after supply or services completion, even if there are outstanding  unliquidated  obligations  on  the  case,  while  non-ACC  method  requires  that  all case obligations are supply and financially complete.  The partner's preference and the type of case funding determine which method is used.  Cases are identified in  CMCS as closure type  1  (non-participating),  closure  type  2  (accelerated,  interim  closure),  and  closure  type  3 (accelerated,  final  closure).    Cases  identified  for  closure  under  the  accelerated  method  will receive  priority  over  those  to  be  closed  using  the  standard  method.    Under  the  accelerated method,  the  oldest  supply/service  complete  cases  will  be  closed  first.    Exceptions  to  these priorities will be made by DSCA.  See DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 6 for further discussion of case closure. 5.13.  Case Cancellation. 5.13.1.  Partner-Requested Case Cancellations.  Partners may request that their FMS cases be  cancelled.    After  a  case  has  been  implemented,  cancellations  are  processed  as  a    case closure.  The partner is responsible for any termination costs as well as any estimated admin costs associated with the case. 5.13.2.  USG-Requested  Case  Cancellations.    In  accordance  with  the  LOA  Standards Terms and Conditions, the USG may cancel a case (or any part of a case) when US national interest  requires  it.    The  amount  of  admin  charges  assessed  against  cases  cancelled  by  the USG must be approved by DSCA even if the proposed amount is $0. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   85  Chapter 6 TRANSPORTATION OF SECURITY ASSISTANCE MATERIEL 6.1.  Military Assistance Program Address Directory (MAPAD). 6.1.1.  DoD  Manual  4000.25-8-M,  Military  Assistance  Program  Address  Directory (MAPAD)  System,  is  the  directory  of  clear-text  addresses  for  moving  materiel  and distributing  documents  for  security  assistance  programs.    Partner  representatives  are responsible  for  the  clear-text  addresses  and  the  address  codes  required  by  the  Defense Automatic  Address  System  Center  (DAASC)  for  publication  in  the  electronic  MAPAD, Sections B and C, and for timely submission of changes.  Partner representatives are required to  send  any  changes/updates  to  the  Command  Country  Manager  (CCM).    The  CCM  will review  and  validate  the  request  then  forward  to  the  AFSAC  Transportation  Office (AFSAC/IARGC) for processing. 6.1.2.  The CCM and the partner’s representative are responsible for reviewing the partner’s MAPAD  listing  annually.    Any  obsolete  information  must  be identified  to  AFSAC/IARGC for deletion or modification. 6.2.  Freight Forwarder. 6.2.1.  The shipper arranges for the movement of foreign military sales (FMS) articles to the partner’s designated location (usually the freight forwarder).  The majority of shipments are sourced  from  "stock-fund"  inventories,  where  the  price  of  the  materiel  includes  the  cost  of transportation to the partner's freight forwarder or continental United States (CONUS) port of embarkation  (POE).    Therefore,  the  stock-fund  account  pays  transportation  costs  to  the freight forwarder or POE.  Collect Commercial Bills of Lading (CCBL) may be used for the remaining amount of non-stock funded shipments, provided the requisition reflects delivery term code (DTC) ―4.‖  In either instance, the partner is responsible for all transportation costs onward from the freight forwarder or POE.  Non-stock funded shipments include non-stock funded items and stock-funded items purchased on a contract that has been funded with FMS funds for direct delivery to the partner’s freight forwarder, regardless of DTC. 6.2.2.  The  Security  Assistance  Management  Information  System  (SAMIS)  provides information  on  shipments  moving  through  the  partner’s  freight  forwarder,  based  on  inputs from the inventory control point, the freight forwarder, and the partner.  It tracks reparables being  returned  to  the  CONUS  as  well  as  items  moving  to  the  partner.    SAMIS  produces status  products  for  management  review.    To  participate  in  the  freight-tracking  program, countries  and  their  freight  forwarders  are  responsible  for  generating  the  appropriate transactions and transmitting them to SAMIS. 6.2.3.  AFSAC/IARGC will perform assistance visits to CONUS-based freight forwarders as allowed by individual partner countries and when the appropriate resourcing is available. 6.3.  Offer Release Code (ORC). 6.3.1.  The ORC determines how a shipment will be released.  It is required for each materiel line  item  on  the  Letter  of  Offer  and  Acceptance  (LOA),  and  indicates  whether  DD  Form 1348-5,  Notice  of  Availability/Shipment  should  be  sent  by  the  shipper  before  shipping  the materiel.   86  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 6.3.2.  The DD Form 1348-5 is a document by which a United States (US) shipping activity notifies  the  partner’s  freight  forwarder  or  partner  representative  that  materiel  is  ready  for shipment.   The data to  be entered on the DD Form  1348-5 describes the  shipment  unit and will contain type pack, pieces, weight, cube, security classification, date DD Form 1348-5 is transmitted, national stock number (NSN), and the control number assigned to the shipment.  The  DD  Form  1348-5  will  be  forwarded  to  the  recipient  specified  in  the  MAPAD  (for unclassified  shipments:    Type  of  Address  Code  (TAC)  ―3‖;  for  classified  shipments:    the partner representative on the front page of the country’s MAPAD).  For complete instructions on  how  a  DD  Form  1348-5  is  prepared,  refer  to  DoD  Manual  4000.25-1-M,  Military Standard Requisition and Issue Procedures  (MILSTRIP) Manual. 6.3.3.  ORC  A.    Materiel  with  an  ORC  "A"  is  released  automatically  for  shipment.    If  the materiel is classified, sensitive, hazardous, explosive, oversized or requires special handling, then disregard the ORC ―A‖ and send DD Form 1348-5 under the guidelines for ORC ―Z.‖ 6.3.4.  ORC Y.  Materiel with an ORC ―Y‖ must be held and a DD Form 1348-5 sent to the TAC ―3‖ address  in  the MAPAD.  The addressee will have 15 calendar  days to  respond to the notice.  If the addressee does not respond within 15 calendar days, then the shipper will automatically release the materiel for shipment. 6.3.5.  ORC  X.    Materiel  with  an  ORC  ―X‖  must  have  a  corresponding  ―X‖  in  the  Ship-to Code/MILSTRIP  record  position  ―47‖  to  identify  that  the  materiel  will  be  moved  via  the Defense  Transportation  System  (DTS);  or  there  must  be  a  ―W‖  in  the  Ship-To/MILSTRIP record  position  ―47‖  to  indicate  special  shipping  instructions  for  this  materiel.    If  special shipping  instructions  are  indicated,  the  origin  shipping  office  must  contact  the  CCM  to determine the correct location to transport the materiel. 6.3.6.  ORC Z.  Classified materiel with an ORC ―Z‖ must be held and a DD Form 1348-5 sent  to  the  partner-designated  representative  as  identified  on  the  front  page  of  the  partner’s MAPAD.  Unclassified materiel with an ORC ―Z‖ must be held and notice sent to the TAC ―3‖ address as listed in the MAPAD.  The DD Form 1348-5 recipient has 15 calendar days to respond  to  the  notice.    If  there  is  no  response,  the  origin  shipper  will  send  a  2nd/follow-up notice  to  the  partner  representative/TAC  ―3‖  addressee.    If  the  recipient  does  not  respond within 15 calendar days, a 3rd follow-up will be  sent  to  the partner representative/TAC ―3‖ addressee with copies to the AFSAC/IARGC and the CCM.  When an ORC ―Z‖ is assigned to  an  article  being  supplied  from  a  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  depot,  the  partner  will incur  storage  fees  if  the  original  DD  Form  1348-5  is  not  responded  to  in  15  calendar  days from the date it was sent.  The storage fee is 0.125% of the article cost per month (or portion thereof). 6.4.  Delivery Term Code (DTC). 6.4.1.  The DTC identifies the point within the transportation cycle where responsibility for movement passes from the United States Government (USG) to the partner.  A numeric code is used for one-way transportation from the source of supply to the partner.  An alpha code is used exclusively for FMS repair/return shipments. 6.4.2.  Most  "spares"  are  managed  within  a  stock-fund.    Because  transportation  charges  are included in the stock-funded item standard price, these shipments are moved prepaid, by the stock-fund, to the partner’s freight forwarder or POE.  This segment of transportation (from AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   87  the  source  of  supply  to  the  freight  forwarder  or  POE)  is  always  prepaid  by  the  stock-fund regardless of what DTC is used in the requisition/transportation control number.  Non-stock funded  shipments  will  continue  to  move  on  a  collect  or  reimbursable  basis  in  accordance with  the  DTC.    The  non-stock  funded  shipment  category  includes  non-stock  funded  items and stock-funded items purchased on a contract funded with FMS case funds. 6.4.3.  LOA lines that include DTC ―7‖ must use the LOA note issued for specific situations where  the  USG  must  retain  title  of  the  FMS  materiel  to  allow  transit  through  nations  with restrictive  customs  requirements.    Approval  from  Defense  Security  Cooperation  Agency (DSCA)  Strategy  Directorate  must  be  obtained  in  advance  prior  to  using  the  note.  Implementing agencies must enter the LOA note during LOAD Development. 6.5.  Evidence of Shipment. 6.5.1.  All  FMS  materiel  shipments  must  be  traceable.    The  following  documents  are acceptable proof of shipment: 6.5.1.1.  For  shipment  by  Collect  Commercial  Bill  of  Lading  (CCBL),  a  copy  of  the signed  CCBL  and  either  the  DD  Form  250,  Materiel  Inspection  and  Receiving  Report, DD  Form  1348-1A,  DoD  Issue  Release/Receipt  Document,  DD  Form  1149,  Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, or a Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) Receiving Report.  All of the forms must accurately reflect what is being sent with the cargo shipment. 6.5.1.2.  For  shipments  by  small  parcel  carrier,  a  copy  of  the  pick  up  record/shipping manifest showing the tracking number and one of the following:  the DD Form 250, DD Form  1348-1A, DD Form  1149, or a WAWF Receiving Report.  All  of  the forms  must accurately reflect what is being sent with the cargo shipments. 6.5.1.3.  For shipments by United States Postal Service (USPS), a copy of the document which  shows  the  insured  or  registered  number,  and  either  the  DD  Form  250,  DD  Form 1348-1A or DD Form 1149. 6.5.1.4.  For  shipments  by  Commercial  Bill  of  Lading  (CBL),  a  copy  of  the  CBL accompanied by a copy of the Form 250, DD Form 1348-1A, or DD Form 1149. 6.6.  Proof of Delivery Criteria for Reparable Shipments to DoD Depots. 6.6.1.  Proof  of  delivery  establishes  transfer  of  custody  and  liability  from  the  partner  to  the DoD.  The following are required as valid proof of delivery: 6.6.1.1.  Copy  of  the  carrier’s  delivery  receipt  containing  legible  data  and  name  (or signature) of the individual who signed for the materiel at the repair facility. 6.6.1.2.  The  number  of  pieces,  weight,  and  cube  in  the  total  shipment  must  agree  with that shown on the supply documentation. 6.6.1.3.  Requisition number and/or transportation control number (TCN) assigned by the shipper  identifying  the  materiel  on  the  bill  of  lading  to  enable  cross-referencing  to  the supply documentation. 6.6.1.4.  For multi-pack or consolidated shipments, a copy of the packing list identifying the missing item’s requisition number contained within the shipment. 6.6.1.5.  A copy of the DD Form 1348-1A for the item in question.   88  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 6.7.  Transportation of Classified Materiel. 6.7.1.  Classified materiel is packaged and marked IAW the latest versions of DoD 5200.1-R, Information  Security  Program;  AFI  31-401,  Information  Security  Program  Management; MIL-STD-129,  Military  Marking  for  Shipment  and  Storage;  MIL-STD-130,  Identification Marking  of  U.S.  Military  Property;  and  MIL-STD-2073,  Standard  Practice  for  Military Packaging. 6.7.2.  Shipments  of classified FMS articles usually move through the  DTS  or the partner’s Defense Security Service (DSS) cleared freight forwarder, or partner-arranged pickups (DTC ―8‖).  The DTS (DTC ―7‖ or ―9‖) is the preferred method for providing the needed security and  enables  the  Air  Force  (AF)  to  maintain  control  and  custody  of  the  materiel  until  final delivery to the partner. 6.7.3.  Only  freight  forwarders  granted  an  appropriate  DSS  facility  security  clearance  may receive, process, and store US classified materiel.  Freight forwarders with an assigned TAC of "C" or "D" in the MAPAD are authorized to receive and process classified materiel with a security  classification  of  confidential.    Freight  forwarders  with  an  assigned  TAC  of  "A"  or "B"  in  the  MAPAD  are  authorized  to  receive  and  process  classified  materiel  with  security classifications through secret. 6.7.4.  If the freight forwarder cannot  accept classified materiel, or the materiel is sensitive, explosive, or for some other reason cannot be shipped to the freight forwarder according to the  assigned  DTC,  the  shipper  must  obtain  new  shipping  instructions  from  the  Case/Line Manager. The request must provide the following information: 6.7.4.1.  Requisition number. 6.7.4.2.  FMS case identifier. 6.7.4.3.  Quantity and item description. 6.7.4.4.  National Stock Number (NSN). 6.7.4.5.  Number of pieces, total weight, and cube. 6.7.4.6.  Security classification. 6.7.4.7.  Hazardous materiel classification. 6.7.5.  Classified materiel requires continuous accountability from the source of supply to the partner’s consignee.  Accountability and protective custody may be provided by the USG, by authorized  representatives  of  the  partner,  or  by  a  combination  of  both  USG  and  partner.  Service  by  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC)  meets  required  security  requirements  and  is  the preferred method for the delivery of classified materiel. 6.7.6.  If  the  purchasing  partner  proposes  to  purchase  classified  defense  articles,  a Transportation Plan must be approved by USG and accepted in writing by the partner prior to any movement of the classified materiel.  The requirement for a Transportation Plan must be identified during pre-LOA processing. 6.7.6.1.  The  Transportation  Plan  must  be  comprehensive  and  meet  the  requirements  of DoD 5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) and DoD 5200.1-R, Information  Security  Program,  and  must  provide  continuous  accountability  and AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   89  protective custody.  If ―Repair and Return‖  LOAs are involved, the Transportation Plan must be expanded accordingly. 6.7.6.2.  The  plan  is  developed  by  the  Case  Manager  (CM),  CCM  or  program  office  in coordination with the partner or the partner’s designated government representative.  The freight  forwarder  may  assist  in  the  preparation  of  the  plan.    It  is  the  responsibility  of country directors, CMs, CCMs and program offices to ensure that the Transportation Plan is  accomplished  and  approved  in  a  timely  manner.    The  CCM  is  responsible  for coordinating  the  plan  with  the  partner  and  providing  a  copy  of  the  approved Transportation Plan to all parties involved in the process.  This includes the FMS partner, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) primary port of exit, the Defense Security Service Industrial Field representative, all couriers/escorts involved, and other parties involved in the  movement  process. the  approved Transportation  Plan  is  through  email  transmission,  but  the  plan  may  also  be  faxed,  or mailed.   The  preferred  method  for transmitting 6.7.6.3.  The  applicable  security  office  will  review  and  approve  the  Transportation  Plan for  each  individual  LOA.    The  supporting  security  office  will  verify  that  the  transfer arrangements  are  in  compliance  with  DoD  policy.    SAF/IAPX  in  coordination  with  the Administrative  Assistant  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  Directorate  of  Information Protection  (SAF/AAP)  will  review  and  approve  Transportation  Plans  for  LOAs  with multiple MAJCOM involvement. 6.7.6.4.  The approved Transportation Plan is an integral part of all official copies of the LOA.    Partners  are  responsible  for  insuring  their  freight  forwarders  have  a  copy  of  the LOA  and  approved  Transportation  Plan  when  they  are  involved  with  CONUS  custody transfer of classified materiel (DTC 4, 5, 8, B, C, E, H or J). 6.7.6.5.  The approved Transportation Plan must be a part of the LOA package provided to  the  CBP  primary  port  of  exit,  upon  the  export  of  the  classified  materiel  and  when lodging  the  DSP-94,  Authority  to  Export  Defense  Articles  Sold  Under  the  Foreign Military Sales Program. 6.7.7.  Presentation of the LOA to the partner will not be delayed pending completion of the Transportation Plan; however, the CM will ensure proper safeguards are in place to prevent release  of  classified  items  for  shipment  prior  to  approval  of  a  Transportation  Plan  (i.e., suspension of line(s) or withholding of obligation authority). 6.8.  Transportation of Hazardous and Explosive Materiel. the  Defense 6.8.1.  Hazardous  and  explosive  materiel  are  shipped  according Transportation  Regulations  (DTR);  AFI  24-203,  Preparation  and  Movement  of  Air  Force Cargo;  AFMAN  24-204-IP,  Preparing  Hazardous  Materials  for  Military  Air  Shipments; International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) certification and/or International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) code, as applicable. to 6.8.2.  Firearms,  explosives,  lethal  chemicals,  and  other  explosive  or  hazardous  materiel usually  move  through  the  DTS  to  a  CONUS  water  port  of  embarkation  (WPOE)  or  aerial port  of  embarkation  (APOE)  controlled  by  the  DoD.    They  will  be  on-loaded  to  a  partner-owned, -operated, or -controlled aircraft or surface vessel for onward movement.   90  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 6.8.3.  The following DTCs apply to shipment of explosive or hazardous materiel: 6.8.3.1.  DTC  8  –  Items  shipped  to  the  CONUS  POE  and  on-loaded  onto  the  partner-owned, -operated, or -controlled aircraft or vessel. 6.8.3.2.  DTC 9 – Partner accepts delivery at the AMC aerial port of debarkation (APOD) or  Military  Sealift  Command  (MSC)/Surface  Deployment  and  Distribution  Command (SDDC) designated water port of debarkation (WPOD). 6.8.3.3.  DTC 7 – USG provides onward transportation to the partner's consignee.  Note:  DTC 7 is only allowed if channel flights are available into the partner country. 6.8.4.  If  materiel  is  both  hazardous  and  classified,  the  packaging,  marking,  and  shipping procedures for both the hazardous and classified factors must be followed. 6.8.5.  When the partner’s freight forwarder arranges transportation for hazardous materiel, a DD Form 1348-5 is sent to the address indicated by the Type Address Code (TAC) ―3‖ in the MAPAD.  The items are held, and follow-up notices are sent every 15 days until a response is received.  See paragraph 6.3.6. for notice of availability (NOA) follow-up procedures.  The DD  Form  1348-5  will  require  the  freight  forwarder  to  indicate  whether  International  Civil Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  or  International  Maritime  Dangerous  Good  (IMDG)  Code certification is needed. 6.8.6.  CCBLs are not authorized for hazard class 1 (explosive) shipments. 6.8.7.  Hazardous  materiel  scheduled  for  movement  aboard  foreign-owned  or  foreign-controlled  aircraft  must  be  packaged,  marked,  labeled,  and  certified  according  to  Title  49, Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR),  and  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO) regulations.    Commercial  air  carriers  must  obtain  exemption  required  by  Title  49,  CFR.  Competent Authority Approval (CAA) is required by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT)  whenever  hazardous  class  ―1‖  (explosive)  is  shipped.    The  transportation  officer/air terminal officer at the on-load base is responsible for the compatibility of hazardous materiel moved on foreign-owned or foreign controlled aircraft and must comply with the following: 6.8.7.1.  Non-compatible hazardous materiel cannot be shipped by commercial carrier. 6.8.7.2.  Non-compatible  hazardous  materiel  may  be  shipped  by  the  partner’s  military aircraft,  provided,  approval  to  ship  non-compatibles  is  obtained  from  the  partner  and forwarded to AF Supply Management Division (AF/A4RM). 6.8.8.  Competent  Authority  Approval  (CAA).    The  partner  is  responsible  for  obtaining their  country’s  CAA  for  the  movement  of  explosive  materiel  from  the  US-DoD  controlled port of embarkation to their country’s final in-country destination.  Once the partner has the country  issued  CAA,  the  partner  may  then  apply  for  a  DoT  issued  CAA  for  explosive materiel movement within CONUS. 6.9.  Exceptions to Standard Transportation. 6.9.1.  When the AF determines shipment by CCBL is impractical or improper, the AF will arrange  for  transportation.    Exceptions  to  the  CCBL  method  are,  prepaid  small  parcel shipments and those shipments authorized to move through the DTS. 6.9.2.  When the shipment moves through the DTS by Government Bill of Lading (GBL) or small parcel carrier to a partner, including a recipient freight forwarder, and loss or damage AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   91  occurs,  the  recipient  must  file  a  claim  with  the  carrier.    If  resolution  with  the  shipper  is unsuccessful,  recipient  may  submit  qualifying  Supply  Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs)  to request additional shipment or billing information, or to obtain USG assistance in resolving the discrepancy.  The USG has responsibility for filing and processing claims with  carriers when shipment is made on a prepaid basis to locations where DoD personnel or other USG representatives have primary responsibility for receipt, inspection and acceptance.  When the USG files the claim, the benefits will be reimbursed to the partner. 6.9.3.  Embedded  computer  system  software  is  shipped  according  to  TO  00-5-17,  USAF Computer  Program  Identification  Numbering  (CPIN)  System.    Priority  deliveries  may  be made by any means approved for transit or transmission of classified materiel.  Examples of approved  methods  include  use  of  freight  forwarder  certified  to  handle  classified,  point-to-point Secure Telephone  Unit  data transmissions approved by the National  Security  Agency (NSA), mailing to the Security Cooperation Officer (SCO), or authorized hand-carrying.  If transmission  is  via  means  other  than  the  freight  forwarder,  the  CCM  is  responsible  for ensuring proper decrementing of the DSP-94 for the value of the computer system software. 6.10.  Small Package Shipments. 6.10.1.  The AF must document shipment of small package materiel to the FMS partner.  For small parcel shipments, a small package carrier receipt or US Postal Service (USPS) special service  receipt  (i.e.,  insured,  certified,  or  registered  mail)  that  shows  proof  of  delivery  into the transportation network will constitute proof of shipment. 6.10.2.  When the USPS is used for delivery of FMS materiel, the items must be registered. USPS-registered mail may be used to ship small parcels to Canada. 6.10.3.  If international mail is used for small package shipments, it must be specified in the LOA. 6.10.4.  Except for classified or hazardous items, NOA procedures will not be used for small package shipments. 6.11.  Shipments Moved via the DTS which Terminate in a Third Country. 6.11.1.  For any shipment moving via the DTS which terminates in a third country (e.g., not the purchasing partner), the purchasing partner is responsible for all prior coordination with the  third  country’s  water  or  aerial  port  and  and/or  customs  personnel  to  ensure  onward movement  of  the  materiel.    For  materiel  being  sent  to  Ramstein  AB,  Germany  for  onward movement  within  European  Command  (EUCOM),  the  EUCOM  FMS  Transportation Concept  of  Operations  (CONOPS)  procedures  will  be  followed.    If  no  APOD/WPOD  is indicated in  the MAPAD, the shipper must  advise the Case/Line Manager that the materiel cannot  be  shipped.    The  Case/Line  Manager  will  advise  the  country  representative  that  an APOD/WPOD in the partner’s country or in a third country must be identified and included in the MAPAD before the materiel will be shipped. 6.11.2.  The  partner  will  make  all  arrangements  for  the  movement  of  materiel  from  the APOD/WPOD to the ―mark for‖ address. 6.12.  Return of Partner Materiel to the CONUS for Repair. 6.12.1.  Reparables are returned to the CONUS according to AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual.  Alpha DTCs are used to indicate two-way transportation.  Normally, the USG has   92  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 no  responsibility  for  moving  reparable  materiel,  and  DTC  "E"  freight  forwarder-arranged transportation applies. 6.12.2.  When the partner is responsible for all transportation (DTC "E"), the partner should consign  the  shipment  to  the  CONUS  freight  forwarder  or  partner  representative  at  the  US port of entry.  When DTC "C," "D," "E," "H," or "J" is used, the freight forwarder or partner representative is responsible for obtaining and providing all documents necessary for clearing inbound US customs.  These include, but are not limited to, the following: 6.12.2.1.  DD Form 1348-1A. 6.12.2.2.  Department  of  State  Form  61  (DSP-61),  Application/License  for  Temporary Import of Unclassified Defense Articles. 6.12.2.3.  Department of State Form 85 (DSP-85), Application for Permanent/Temporary Export  or  Temporary  Import  of  Classified  Defense  Articles  and  Related  Classified Technical Data. 6.12.3.  Under DTC "E", shipping instructions need only direct the reparable materiel to the designated repair facility.  It is the responsibility of the partner or freight forwarder to clear customs and deliver materiel to the designated repair facility at no expense to the USG. 6.12.4.  When the USG has transportation responsibility, the detailed instructions represented by  the  assigned  DTC  must  be  provided  to  the  FMS  partner.    The  Transportation  Account Code (TAC), transportation appropriation, and the applicable port of embarkation (POE) and port  of  debarkation  (POD)  must  also  be  provided.    The  USG  accepts  only  custodial responsibility,  not  title,  for  reparable  items  after  they  are  received  at  the  repair  facility  and are being transported via the US DTS and while being transported outside the US DTS.  If a reparable item is lost while being transported via the DTS, the partner has no claim against the USG. 6.12.5.  The return leg of an FMS Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) may be used for the return of partner-owned reparable materiel under the following conditions: 6.12.5.1.  Retrograde  materiel  transported  on  a  returning  SAAM  flight  is  specifically covered in the FMS case under which the SAAM is authorized.  The partner must provide the  total  weight,  cube,  number  of  pieces,  all  required  customs  documentation  and arrangements  for  materiel  movement  to  the  final  CONUS  destination.    This  must  be included in  the  LOA for approval  by DSCA.   The implementing instructions  will show all the needed information on the returned cargo. 6.12.5.2.  Returned materiel is authorized for shipment on SAAM aircraft to the CONUS POE or to the home station of the aircraft. 6.12.5.3.  Additional flying hours for retrograde materiel are charged to the partner. 6.12.5.4.  Information on reparable materiel to be transported on the returning segment of the SAAM must be included on the original SAAM request sent to AMC by the SAAM validator.  The  SAAM  validator  for  the  AF  FMS  is  the  AFMC  Traffic  Management Division (AFGLSC/635 SCMW). 6.13.  Preservation, Packing, and Marking. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   93  6.13.1.  AFI  24-203,  AFMAN  24-204-IP,  and  latest  edition  of  MIL-STD-2073  contain  AF instructions  for  packaging  security  assistance  articles.    FMS  materiel  shall  be  packaged  in accordance with MIL-STD-2073.  Military preservation and Level B packing per MIL-STD-2073  is  required  for  overseas  surface  shipments.    All  FMS  shipments  shall  be  marked  in accordance with MIL-STD-129 and also include:  FMS case identifier, TCN, transportation priority,  project  code  (if  applicable),  ―ship-from‖  address,  ―ship-to‖  address,  and  ultimate consignee  ―mark-for‖  address.    Multi-packs/consolidations  will  only  contain  items  for  the same  US  sponsoring  service,  recipient  partner,  "mark-for"  address,  freight  forwarder  code, FMS case designator, project code (if applicable), and priority designator.  Grant Aid may be consolidated into shipment units if under the same US service code, recipient partner, "mark-for" address, project code (if applicable), and priority designator. 6.13.2.  All  shipments  to  International  Standards  for  Phytosanitary  Measures  (ISPM)  15 participating countries, containing wood packaging materiel, must be in compliance with the regulatory  guidance  as  stated  in  DoD  4140.01-M-01,  COMPLIANCE  FOR  DEFENSE PACKAGING:    Phytosanitary  Requirements  for  Wood  Packaging  Material,  and  the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM), Publication No. 15, Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade.  Any FMS shipment that is not  compliant  will  not  proceed  until  it  is  brought  into  compliance,  or  a  country  waiver  is provided.  The shipping activity will notify the MILDEP of the shipment hold status.  Should an  ISPM  15  participating  partner  decline  to  provide  a  waiver,  costs  of  remediation  or repacking  will  be  considered  a  supply  discrepancy  and  will  not  be  charged  to  the  partner.  The one exception to this rule occurs when only old, noncompliant wood is available for an FMS  case  to  an  ISPM  15  participating  partner.    The  partner  should  be  given  the  option  to wait for a new procurement of ISPM 15 compliant WPM, to waive the ISPM 15 requirement for  that  case  only,  or  to  pay  for  remediation  costs.    Shipments  to  non-ISPM  participating countries will be certified using the ―DoD Pest Free Compliance Procedures‖ as directed in Appendix 3 of the DoD 4140.01-M-01 regulation.  The MILDEP will notify the shipper of the partner’s determination and proceed with shipment processing accordingly. 6.14.  Export Documents. 6.14.1.  The  partner/freight  forwarder  is  responsible  for  all  export  documentation  and clearances,  if  shipments  are  not  made  through  the  DTS.    Export  documentation  includes completion  of  the  DSP-94  and  a  copy  of  the  complete  LOA  (including  all  amendments, modifications  and  any  applicable  Transportation  Plan)  provided  to  the  Customs  Export Office. 6.15.  Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS). 6.15.1.  The USG issues articles and provides services under the UMMIPS according to the force  activity  designator  (FAD)  assigned  by  the  Joint  Staff  and  the  urgency  of  need designator  (UND).  Security  assistance  shipments  are  subject  to  the  same  UMMIPS  time standards as DoD shipments. 6.15.2.  Partners  should  evaluate  each  requirement  and  select  the  correct  UND  for  the circumstances.    Partners  should  show  the  UND  for  requests  on  defined  order  cases.  Regardless of the priority, items are issued only if on-hand stock is above the control point, unless  the  partner  has  pre-funded  FMS  sustainment  support  under  a  Cooperative  Logistics   94  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 Supply/Support  Arrangement  (CLSSA).    The  inventory  management  specialist  (IMS) determines whether AF support will be adversely affected. 6.15.3.  UMMIPS  timeframes  apply  to  materiel  moved  through  the  DTS.    For  materiel shipped to  a partner's freight  forwarder, only the  timeframes applicable to depot  processing are captured for analysis; however, the transportation mode selection is made with a carrier that will otherwise meet UMMIPS standards. 6.16.  FMS Transportation Charges. 6.16.1.  Pricing  and  billing  procedures  are  contained  in  DoD  7000.14-R,  DoD  Financial Management  Regulations  (FMRs),  Volume  15,  Security  Assistance  Policy  and  Procedures, Chapters 7 and 8.  For stock-funded items, transportation costs to the CONUS based freight forwarder or the CONUS POE are included in the standard price. 6.16.2.  For non-stock-funded items, transportation costs are based on the value assigned and computed  by  DTC  as  shown  in  block  11  of  the  LOA.    The  transportation  bill  code  (TBC) reported  in  the  DD-COMP  (M)  1517  report  overrides  the  DTC  and  automatically  corrects transportation charges, when the shipper does not ship the item according to the DTC. 6.16.3.  Transportation  Cost  Look-Up  Table.    The  transportation  cost  look-up  table contains  estimated  actual  transportation  costs  for  items  normally  shipped  through  the  DTS, when  costs  using  standard  transportation  percentages  are  significantly  different  from  the actual  charges.    When  these  items  are  reported  on  the  DD-COMP  (M)  1517  report,  the transportation cost estimate in the look-up table is charged to the partner.  To keep the table current,  inland transportation, port loading, trans-ocean  (sea  and airlift),  and port unloading cost for each item is submitted annually by AFSAC/IARGC to SAF/IAPX.  These updates as well as recommended new items for the table are provided to SAF/IAPX by December 10th each year. 6.16.4.  Estimated Actual Charges.  An estimated actual transportation cost is based on the carrier's actual tariffs.  The charge must be directed or approved by DSCA and recoups total transportation  costs.    The  charge  appears  in  the  LOA  and  the  transportation  cost  look-up table  maintained  at  the  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service,  Indianapolis  Center, Security Cooperation Accounting (DFAS-IN/JAX).  When not covered by the transportation cost look-up table or transportation billing for grant aid/Military Assistance Program (MAP) countries,  the  implementing  agencies  use  "NX"  to  report  estimated  actual  transportation charges. 6.16.5.  Detention  and  Demurrage  Charges.  Detention and Demurrage charges related to delays in FMS shipments caused by freight forwarders are to be charged at the actual cost to the applicable FMS case and line. 6.16.5.1.  Detention.  A charge made on a carrier conveyance, due to being held by or for a  consignor  or  consignee  beyond  the  allowable  free  time  for  loading  or  unloading,  for forwarding  directions,  or  for  any  other  purpose  authorized  and  documented  by  the consignor  or  consignee.    Charges  for  detention  are  in  addition  to  all  other  lawful transportation charges. 6.16.5.2.  Demurrage.    A  charge  against  a  consignor  or  consignee  for  holding  carrier equipment  beyond  the  allowable  free  time  for  loading  and  unloading,  for  forwarding AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   95  directions,  or  for  any  other  purpose  authorized  and  documented  by  the  consignor  or consignee.   It  may  also  be a charge to  shippers, accruing from the time the container is discharged  from  the  vessel.    Charges  for  demurrage  are  in  addition  to  all  other transportation  charges.    Demurrage  charges  typically  are  associated  with  rail  and  water port operations. 6.17.  Loading and Unloading Foreign-Owned or -Controlled Aircraft at Air Force Bases. 6.17.1.  The  loading  or  unloading  of  foreign  partner-owned  or  –controlled  aircraft  will  be charged as stated in AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits; AFI 10-1002, Agreements For  Civil  Aircraft  Use  Of  Air  Force  Airfields;  or  AFI  10-1801,  Foreign  Governmental Aircraft Landings at United States Air Force Installations as applicable.   96  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 Chapter 7 SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES 7.1.  Command Levy. 7.1.1.  A  command  levy  is  a  diversion  of  assets  from  an  operational  Air  Force  (AF) command  to  support  an  FMS  agreement  with  replacement  (generally)  to  the  AF  unit.    A command levy is a last resort and must not be used as a source of supply. 7.1.2.  Command levy may be requested when all of the following conditions apply: 7.1.2.1.  The  materiel  and  services  are  mission-essential.    Mission-essential  materiel  or services are defined as those required to achieve the minimum operating capability of the system.  The system program director (SPD), prime contractors, and operating commands determine the materiel and services needed for minimum operating capability. 7.1.2.2.  The materiel and services will not be available to meet the activation need date of the FMS agreement.  The activation need date is the date of first system delivery in-country or to another AF approved operational site. 7.1.2.3.  The actions in paragraph 0 have been considered. 7.1.2.4.  Command levy is the only alternative. 7.1.3.  Approval for Command Levy.  The Director, Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) must approve diversion, except for moving articles from one user to another or for accelerating deliveries, using the procedures below.  All situations having an adverse impact on AF combat readiness requires congressional notification through DSCA. 7.1.4.  Air  Force  Materiel  Command  (AFMC)  Responsibilities.    The  System  Program Director  (SPD),  Security  Assistance  Program  Manager  (SAPM),  and  Air  Force  Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) Command Country (CCM) or Case Manager (CM) must ensure the  delivery  of  the  required  spares  and  support  equipment  and  services  in  a  timely  manner using  normal  requisitioning  and  procurement  procedures.    This  effort  should  include continual review of program data (specifically mission-essential materiel delivery schedules) to identify potential problem areas.  If normal requisitioning and procurement procedures are not sufficient to deliver the required materiel on time, the following exceptional procedures should be considered: 7.1.4.1.  Workaround procedures. 7.1.4.2.  Accelerated procurement with premium funds. 7.1.4.3.  Sole-source procurement. 7.1.4.4.  Accelerated delivery of onorder partner materiel with premium funds. 7.1.4.5.  Inventory  manager  (IM)  query  of  AF  activities  to  determine  excess  assets  that may be redistributed. 7.1.4.6.  Redistribution  of  onhand  and  onorder  AF  wholesale  stocks,  if  this  will  not adversely affect the AF or other programmed requirements. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   97  7.1.4.7.  Diversion of other foreign military sales (FMS) countries’ on order stocks, with their permission or with DSCA concurrence (see AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 9). 7.1.4.8.  Redistribution of FMS partner owned materiel as a result of previous sales. 7.1.4.9.  Direct commercial purchase by the FMS partner. 7.1.4.10.  309th  Aerospace  Maintenance  and  Regeneration  Group  (AMARG)  and  base closures considered as a source of supply (SoS). 7.1.5.  Command Levy Procedures. 7.1.5.1.  Note  that  timeframes  are  the  minimum  to  ensure  timely  delivery.    These timeframes  may  be  compressed  to  meet  high-priority,  time-sensitive  United  States government (USG) commitments. 7.1.5.2.  The  SAPM  will  identify  potential  command  levy  candidates  in  a  critical  item tracking list as part of the FMS Management Plan and update the list quarterly. 7.1.5.3.  The  SAPM  will  get  the  SPD's  endorsement  and  send  the  list  of  potential command  levy  candidates  to  the  applicable  major  command/Logistics  (MAJCOM/A4) for  assessment  180  days  before  the  activation  need  date.    Information  copies  should  be sent to the Deputy Chief of Staff/Logistics, Installations and Mission Support, Directorate of  Logistics  (AF/A4L);  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force/International  Affairs, Security  Assistance  Policy  and International  Training  &  Education  Division (SAF/IAPX);  AFSAC  Plans  and  Programs  Office  (AFSAC/XP);  and  the  appropriate Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force/International  Affairs  (SAF/IA)  and  AFSAC regional divisions. 7.1.5.4.  Within 30 days, the MAJCOM/A4 will respond to the SAPM (with information copies  as  indicated  in  paragraph  0)  with  their  concurrence  or  non-concurrence  with  the proposed command levy.  If the AF concurs with the diversion, the following information must also be provided: 7.1.5.4.  1    The  suggested  locations  from  which  to  take  the  assets,  and  the  quantity  and condition of the materiel if the AF approves the command levy. 7.1.5.4.2.  The effect of the command levy on the unit's ability to perform its mission (i.e., its ability to generate sorties and its mission capability rate). 7.1.5.5.  The  SAPM  will  send  the  request  for  command  levy  to  the  CCM  and AFMC/Logistics (AFMC/A4), to arrive no later than 120 calendar days before activation need date.  The request must be signed by the SPD and contain the following information (if  any  of  the  information  cannot  be  determined,  the  SAPM  will  supply  a  best  estimate and identify it as such): 7.1.5.5.1.  National  stock  number  (NSN),  name,  and  requisition  document  number (part  number  and  support  equipment  recommendation  data  (SERD)  number,  if known). 7.1.5.5.2.  The minimum quantity required. 7.1.5.5.3.  The activation need date.   98  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 7.1.5.5.4.  Prior actions taken to improve delivery. 7.1.5.5.5.  Justification  for  the  command  levy  in  terms  of  the  partner's  initial operational capability with the purchased system. 7.1.5.5.6.  The  MAJCOM's  concurrence  or  non-concurrence  and  the  effect  the command levy will have on their capability to perform their mission. 7.1.5.5.7.  The location, quantity, and condition of potential command levy materiel. 7.1.5.5.8.  The materiel replacement date. 7.1.5.5.9.  The current estimated shipping date (ESD) of the FMS materiel on order. 7.1.5.6.  The CCM and AFMC/A4 must return the request, with their coordination, to the SAPM/SPD within 30 days.  The SAPM will then send the  coordinated  request,  signed by the SPD, to SAF/IAPX with an information copy to AFSAC/XP, AFMC/Intelligence and  Requirements  (AFMC/A2/5),  and  the  CCM  to  arrive  no  later  than  90  days  prior  to the activation need date with a recommendation for approval or disapproval. 7.1.5.7.  SAF/IA, in coordination with AF/A4L, will approve or disapprove the command levy  request  60  calendar  days  before  the  activation  need  date  and  will  notify  the SAPM/SPD, the AFSAC CCM, AFSAC/XP, AFMC/A4, and the applicable MAJCOMs.  SAF/IAPX  will  return  disapproved  command  levy  requests  stating  the  reasons  for disapproval. 7.1.5.8.  Upon  notification  of  approval,  the  SAPM  will  provide  the  MAJCOM  and  unit with the following shipping instructions: 7.1.5.8.1.  The  appropriate  ship-to/freight addresses. forwarder  and  mark-for/in-country 7.1.5.8.2.  Instructions  on  how  to  ship  the  materiel.    Normally  a  collect  commercial bill  of  lading  (CCBL)  is  used.    If  a  commercial  bill  of  lading  (CBL)  is  used,  the SAPM will provide the proper transportation fund site to charge transportation costs to the FMS case. 7.1.5.8.3.  Instructions  that  PC&H  costs  incurred  should  be  billed  to  the  partner's case. 7.1.5.8.4.  Instructions to provide the shipping information (date, mode, carrier) to the SAPM and AFSAC CCM. 7.1.5.9.  No later than 30 calendar days after receiving the shipping information from the SAPM, the owning activity will ship the materiel and provide shipping information to the SAPM and AFSAC CCM.  The shipping information will be filed by the SAPM/SPD for case  management  and  possible  audit  purposes.    Security  Assistance  Management Information System (SAMIS) narrative capability will be used to identify command levy items and document the process. 7.1.5.10.  Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISR), the National  Security  Agency the  Air Force/International  Affairs,  Chief  Information  Officer  (SAF/CIO)  must  approve  the command levy of any information security (INFOSEC) items. (NSA),  and  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   99  7.1.6.  Transportation Costs. 7.1.6.1.  First  destination  transportation  costs  are  included  in  the  cost  of  the  item.    The partner  will  be  required  to  pay  any  costs  for  transportation  beyond  the  first  destination.  Items  identified  for  command  levy  that  are  at  an  operational  base  in  the  continental United States (CONUS) will be considered at their first destination regardless of previous shipping history.  For items levied from outside the CONUS, the partner will also pay for the  pre-positioning  costs  associated  with  getting  those  items  to  the  overseas  base.  Transportation costs for the replacement items, those included in the cost of the item and pre-positioning costs will be charged to the FMS case. 7.1.6.2.  Replacement of command-levied materiel. 7.1.6.2.1.  Levied  items  will  be  replaced  in  the  most  expeditious  means  available.  The preferred method is to deliver the materiel directly to the AF base.  The SAPM will monitor the process to ensure proper delivery and reporting occurs. 7.1.6.2.2.  Extended  payback  dates  or  changing  circumstances  may  dictate  other payback procedures.  In these circumstances, the item manager, in coordination with the AF base and the SPD, will determine the appropriate method of payback.  Under the stock funding of reparables concept, delivery of the materiel to the depot for re-requisitioning by the base will not be appropriate. 7.1.6.2.3.  The supporting MAJCOM/A4 will report open command levy paybacks to SAF/IAPX quarterly until all items are replaced or their status is otherwise closed. 7.2.  Drawdowns  Under  Section  506(a)  of  the  Foreign  Assistance  Act  (FAA)  of  1961,  as Amended. 7.2.1.  Section  506(a)  of  the  FAA  authorizes  special  authority  for  the  drawdown  of  articles from  stock  and  non-contractual  services  and  training  from  Department  of  Defense  (DoD) resources in an aggregate value not to exceed $100,000,000 in any fiscal year.  This section of the law does not authorize new procurement or contracting in order to provide or replace the  materiel,  services,  or  training.    It  does  not  provide  funds  or  contract  authority.  Authorized exceptions will be included in the execute order. 7.2.2.  The  Department  of  State  (DoS)  initiates  the  presidential  determination  (PD)  and forwards  it  to  DSCA  for  action.    The  appropriate  DSCA  Geographic  Regional  Directorate formulates a program plan, obtains cost estimates, and initiates an implementing message to the military departments (MILDEPs) providing the following information: 7.2.2.1.  Drawdown directions. 7.2.2.2.  Overall authorization. 7.2.2.3.  Line item authorizations. 7.2.2.4.  Project directive numbers. 7.2.2.5.  Reporting requirements. 7.2.3.  DSCA  will  monitor  the  program  plan  and  advise  the  MILDEPs  of  additional drawdown requirements and authorized revisions.  DSCA will use the partner’s requirements to determine line item categories.   100  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 7.2.4.  DSCA  maintains  official  accounting  and  reporting  responsibilities  and  establishes project directives in the DSCA 1200 system.  They also provide the MILDEPs with a block of  record  control  numbers  (RCN)  to  be  used  for  each  partner  and  in-country  destination.  DSCA  monitors  project  directive  ceilings  and  consolidates  report  control  symbol  (RCS) reports for monthly submittal to Congress. 7.2.5.  SAF/IA  Country  Director  receives  the  execute  order  from  DSCA  and  provides SAF/IAPX with a courtesy copy.  The SAF/IA Country Director prepares and issues an Air Force  506(A)  Execute  Order  message  (Attachment  10).    SAF/IA  will  request  a  project code(s) if not provided by DSCA, and task AFSAC to establish the RCNs in SAMIS.  The AFSAC Operations Support Section (AFSAC/IARSB) will maintain a case or RCN register and issue case identifiers and RCNs to the CMs for all AF actions.  Case designators will be in  the  "U"  series  and  RCNs  in  the  AM00-AW99  series.    AFSAC/IARS  will  input  all  AF RCN actions into the DSCA 1000 system. 7.2.6.  AFSAC will input requisitions for drawdown of articles from stock in accordance with (IAW)  DSCA  and  SAF/IA  instructions.    Requisitions  against  blanket  order  RCNs  will  be processed through SAMIS as programmed, on a "fill or kill" basis, IAW the Force Activity Designator  (FAD)  established  in  the  execute  order.    Command  Country/Case  Manager  will manually  process  requisitions  for  munitions,  equipment,  and  end-items  with  the  inventory management  specialist  (IMS).    AFSAC  monitors  funding,  accounting,  and  financial reporting.  AFSAT tracks all 506 drawdown training requirements in Total Risk Assessment Control System (TRACS) and reports costs to AFSAC. 7.2.7.  All costs incurred for non-contractual services and supplies used to support a Section 506  drawdown,  are  to  be  identified  against  an  AF  Emergency  and  Special  Program  (ESP) code for possible future reimbursement.  The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force/Financial Management and Comptroller, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, Directorate of Budget Management  and  Execution,  Assistant  for  Security  Assistance  (SAF/FMBMS)  requests assignment  of  the  ESP  code.    Each  performing  agency  must  establish  open  accounts receivable for incurred costs against the assigned ESP code. 7.3.  Electronic Combat International Security Assistance Program (ECISAP). 7.3.1.  The  ECISAP  is  an  AF  management  concept  designed  to  provide  FMS  and  security assistance  countries  a  single  management  focal  point  for  the  installation  and  sustainment support of electronic combat (EC) equipment.  The ECISAP will be established as a separate Military  Article  and  Services  List  (MASL)  line  item  in  a  system  sale  Letter  of  Offer  and Acceptance (LOA) or as an individual LOA.  The ECISAP is managed by the Deputy Under Secretary  of  the  Air  Force/International  Affairs,  Foreign  Disclosure,  Weapons  and Technology  Transfer  Division  (SAF/IAPD)  with  the  executive  agent  at  Warner  Robins  Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC), 542 Combat Sustainment Group (542 CBSG).  542 CBSG will coordinate ECISAP efforts among WR-ALC; SAF/IA; the Air Force Air Warfare Center (Air Force  AWC),  36  &  68  Electronic  Warfare  Squadron  (36  EWS/68  EWS);  Deputy  Chief  of Staff,  Intelligence,  Surveillance,  and  Reconnaissance  (AF/A2);  Air  Combat  Command/ Directorate of Operations (ACC/A3); Air Force  Information Warfare Center (AFIWC), and other agencies as determined by the LOA. 7.3.2.  Electronic Combat (EC) Equipment. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   101  7.3.2.1.  The  terms  EC  and  electronic  warfare  (EW)  are  used  interchangeably  in  this document.  There have been several major changes to this terminology.  In general, EC or EW are any military actions involving the use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum and directed  energy  to  control  the  EM  spectrum  or  to  attack  the  enemy.    The  three  major subdivisions of this function are:  electronic attack (EA), electronic protection (EP), and electronic  warfare  support  (ES).    EA  includes  EM  jamming,  EM  interference,  and  EM deception  systems  and  directed  energy,  anti-radiation  missiles  (ARM),  lasers,  radio frequency, and particle beam weapons.  EP includes protection of personnel, equipment, and  facilities  via  such  measures  as  EM  hardening  and  frequency  deconflictions.    ES includes  identification  and  location  of  EM  sources  for  the  purpose  of  immediate  threat recognition and use of this information for other actions such as threat-avoidance (radar warning  receivers  and  missile  warning  systems),  targeting,  and  homing.    ECISAP products currently consist of EA, ES, and integrated EA/ES systems. 7.3.3.  ECISAP Products and Services. 7.3.3.1.  An  ECISAP  MASL  line  item  or  individual  LOA  will  encompass  products  and services  necessary  to  support  an  EC  equipment  sale.    These  products  and  services  may include  the  following  items  or  services,  depending  upon  releasability  criteria  and  other conditions of sale. 7.3.3.1.1.  ECISAP Products.  ECISAP products are those items purchased or created by  an  ECISAP  agency  that  are  deliverable  to  a  partner  as  either  an  end-item  or incorporated within a deliverable end-item.  They include the following: 7.3.3.1.1.1.  EC Systems including software and technical documentation. 7.3.3.1.1.2.  Support  equipment  (common  and  peculiar)  including  software  and technical documentation. 7.3.3.1.1.3.  Mission Data Files developed from releasable intelligence data. 7.3.3.1.2.  ECISAP  Services.    ECISAP  services  are  those  functions  performed  that enable  the  products  described  above  to  be  created,  procured,  delivered,  maintained, modified, and supported.  They include the following. 7.3.3.1.2.1.  Program  management,  including  logistics  support,  configuration management,  production  management,  item  management,  funds  management, technical management, and facility management. 7.3.3.1.2.2.  Systems  engineering,  design  engineering,  (software  engineering), sustaining  engineering,  technical  assistance,  intelligence  data  analysis  and assessment, and emergency reprogramming service. 7.3.3.1.2.3.  Training  and  system  familiarization,  including  worldwide  military reprogramming exercises utilizing the rapid reprogramming capability (SERENE BYTE), communications connectivity checks  and quarterly  exercises, in-country technical reviews, modifications, and overview of system changes and operational impacts, and in-country mobile training team (MTT) support. 7.3.4.  ECISAP Benefits.  These benefits include the following:   102  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 7.3.4.1.  AF  software  technology,  rapid-reprogramming  process,  and  cyclic  software updates and enhancements. 7.3.4.2.  AF improvements in maintenance practices or overhaul instructions. 7.3.4.3.  USG intelligence support. 7.3.4.4.  The  ECISAP  facilitates  cost  sharing  when  multiple  countries  contract  for  the same product. 7.3.5.  Nonparticipation  in  ECISAP.    ECISAP  products  and  services  may  be  delayed  for those international partners who are eligible to participate in the ECISAP program, but elect not  to  participate.    Priority  is  given  to  ECISAP  program  participants  who  have  active ECISAP cases. 7.3.6.  ECISAP Budget and Associated Charges.  ECISAP organizations will develop and follow  financial  management  plans  that  discuss  annual  budgets,  determine  buy-in  and additional  charges  to  new  partners,  and  assess  all  charges  for  products  and  services  to ECISAP members.  Annual budgets will include costs incurred for facilities operation and for the  investment  in  facilities/equipment.    A  copy  of  each  ECISAP  organization's  financial management  plan  and  annual  budget  will  be  submitted  for  review  to  SAF/IAPD.    No expenditure of AF-appropriated funds is allowed.  Similarly, ECISAP funding should not be spent  for  requirements  that,  in  the  absence  of  ECISAP,  would  be  inherently  United  States (US) funded requirements. 7.3.7.  ECISAP  Program  Participation.  ECISAP program participation is encouraged for initial  sale  of  AF-reprogrammable  EC  systems.    There  are  two  types  of  participation available: full-service and technical services. 7.3.7.1.  A  full-service  participation  encompasses  total  system  support,  both  hardware and  software,  to  provide  optimum  performance  of  the  applicable  electronic  combat system. 7.3.7.2.  The technical service only provides responses to partner specific taskings. 7.3.8.  ECISAP  Front-End  Capitalization  Fee.    As  new  systems  are  added  to  ECISAP, costs are incurred to develop the capability to support the new system.  The initial partner for whom  the  support  capability  is  developed  is  charged  for  the  development  expense.    When subsequent  partners  desire  support  of  the  same  system  and  are  supported  from  the previously-developed facility, they must reimburse the initial  investor a share of that initial investment.    This  charge  is  referred  to  as  the  front-end  capitalization  fee.    Front-end capitalization fees shall not be charged after the equipment has aged over ten years.  The goal is  for each participant  in  the facility to  pay an equal  share of the facility  development  cost.  Shares are assessed and billed as partner's initial support case is implemented to the ECISAP. 7.3.9.  ECISAP  Additive  Charge.    If  additional  facilities  and  equipment  are  needed  to support  a  new  partner's  requirements  or  to  support  new  requirements  by  a  current  ECISAP partner,  an  additive  charge  is  assessed.    All  ECISAP  facilities  are  fully  supported  by  the ECISAP budget. 7.3.10.  ECISAP  Initial  Services  Charges.    The  initial  development  or  procurement  of hardware or software for an EC system and its related technical data, inventory management, spares  definitization  and  provisioning,  training,  support  equipment,  site  surveys,  and  any AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   103  other country-specific efforts are examples of the types of initial service that may be assessed and charged to the initial or new ECISAP member. 7.3.11.  ECISAP  Sustainment  Support  Charges. includes maintenance  of  software,  enhancements  to  threat  data  software  tables,  contingency operations  and  emergency  reprogramming,  technical  services,  management  of  repair/return contracts,  and  any  other  efforts  that  benefit  only  the  program  covered  by  a  particular  case.  Included  in  the  cost  of  all  these  efforts  is  the  cost  of  maintaining  the  facilities  that  support these functions.   Sustainment  support 7.3.12.  ECISAP  Software  Support  Services  Charges.    Sustainment  support  for  a reprogrammable  EC  system  consists  predominantly  of  modifying  software  to  incorporate changes to threat data, correcting software errors, implementing FMS or security assistance partner  operational  change  requests  and  incorporating  AF  improvements  (when  releasable).  This  work  is  accomplished  on  a  cyclic  basis  due  to  extensive  changes  and  expanded information  available  on  various  EC  system  threats  provided  by  AF  intelligence  agencies.  These  cyclic  updates  are  referred  to  as  ―block  cycle‖  updates.    The  complexity  of  the software  changes  determines  the  total  block  cycle  schedule  and  delivery  date.    A  detailed discussion of software support is provided in the following sections. 7.3.13.  ECISAP  Service  Charges.    Service  charges  are  based  on  actual  man-hours expended  for  services.    Actual  man-hours  expended  are  determined  by  a  man-hour accounting system.  Pro-rata charges based on the number of installed EC systems will not be assessed.    All  services  are  to  be  fully  supported  by  the  ECISAP  budget;  no  expenditure  of AF-appropriated funds is allowed. 7.3.14.  Releasability.    ECISAP  organizations  and  regional  offices  will  coordinate  and ensure compliance with SAF/IAPD release guidance before LOA presentation.  542 Combat Sustainment  Group,  AF  AWC  and  36  EWS  will  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  disclosure authority (that is, the local Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO)) on all restrictions regarding the release of any technology or information to security assistance partners.  The Delegation of Disclosure  Authority  Letter  (DDL)  provided  by  SAF/IAPD  will  be  consulted  before releasing  any  engineering  change  proposals,  modifications,  or  other  data  to  a  security assistance agency or partner.  A proposal of release beyond an existing DDL is sent through disclosure  channels  to  SAF/IAPD  for  resolution.    Deputy  Chief  of  Staff/Operations,  Plans, and Requirements (AF/A3/5) through Deputy Chief of Staff/ Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AF/A2) and SAF/IAPD will staff the release of ECISAP software updates. 7.3.15.  Security.    ECISAP  facilities  are  configured  to  receive,  store,  analyze,  process,  and issue  up  to  SECRET  data.    A  security  document  peculiar  to  each  member  or  member's system is distributed to the applicable partner agency .  It provides a basis for evaluating the degree  of  protection  necessary  to  safeguard  classified  information  pertaining  to  these systems.    Users  of  the  security  document  must  understand  that  each  document  or  materiel must  be  classified  based  on  its  own  merit,  consistent  with  DoD  5200.1-R,  Information Security Program, AFI 10-1101, Operations Security, and each partner's applicable security document.    Similarly,  ECISAP  funding  should  not  be  spent  for  requirements  that,  in  the absence of ECISAP, would be inherently US funded requirements.   104  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 7.3.16.  ECISAP  Objectives.    The  ECISAP  serves  as  the  single  focal  point  of  initial  (pre-aircraft-delivery)  and  sustainment  (post-aircraft-delivery)  support  of  FMS  and  security assistance EC systems.  Program objectives include the following: 7.3.16.1.  System Changes.  Identify and develop change requirements for hardware and software  deficiencies  and  enhancements.    The  ECISAP  will  manage,  from  inception  to final  resolution,  all  FMS  and  security  assistance  partner-generated  materiel  deficiency reports  (MDRs),  software  problem  reports  (SPRs),  and  operational  change  requests (OCRs).  AF-releasable changes that apply to FMS and security assistance systems will be sent to the potential user for review, approval, and funding.  The ECISAP will ensure that member countries are notified of releasability and applicability. 7.3.16.2.  System Software Support.  ECISAP provides software support for all FMS and security  assistance  EC  systems.    FMS  software  support  process  will  mirror  the  AF support  process  if  feasible.    Exceptions  require  SAF/IAPD  and  AF/A2  approval.    This software support includes Operational Flight Program (OFP), mission data (MD) or threat data, support tool software, and selected maintenance equipment software.  The ECISAP will  provide  periodic  updates  to  this  software  incorporating  OCRs,  SPRs,  and  other releasable  upgrades  received  by  a  formalized  freeze  date  and  approved  by  a  Technical Coordination Meeting (TCM).  The ECISAP will provide changes to the above software through their rapid reprogramming capability during contingencies. 7.3.16.3.  The responsible ECISAP organization develops MD files, either through source code  manipulation  or  with  a  MD  editor/generator,  and  produces  MD  object  code compatible  with  members'  OFPs.    All  MD  and  OFP  sets  are  combined  and  tested  for proper operation, and subjected to an independent software quality assurance test before release.  All software to be installed in integrated ES/EA systems is similarly tested in an integrated configuration (usually on an Integrated Support Station) before release. 7.3.16.4.  The  responsible  ECISAP  organization  develops  and  ships  Country  Standard Technical Orders (CSTO) and/or manuals  reflecting the partner-peculiar data in support of  MD,  OFP  and  support  equipment  software.    The  ECISAP  will  maintain  CSTOs  for each EC system and support equipment configuration supported by the program.  During contingencies,  these  products  may  be  transmitted  electronically  to  those  countries  with appropriate communications equipment. 7.3.16.5.  Technical Services.  The ECISAP will provide analysis and technical assistance to  participating  countries  as  stated  in  their  ECISAP  LOA.    The  same  services  are available  to  any  FMS  partner  on  a  case-by-case  basis  when  requested  through  SAF/IA and funded by a technical services case. 7.3.16.6.  Configuration  Management.    The  responsible  ECISAP  organization  will maintain configuration management of the products provided to an ECISAP partner. 7.3.16.7.  Kit-proofing.    ECISAP  provides  kit-proofing  of  software  updates.    In-country kit-proofing  verifies  that  the  software  update  operates  properly  in  the  partner  country.  Equipment  specialists  and  engineering  personnel  from  WR-ALC  and/or  the  AF  AWC and  36  EWS  conduct  the  in-country  kit-proofing  to  ensure  the  partner  has  a  complete understanding  of  changes  and  its  implementation  is  accurate  and  consistent.    Technical data, technical orders, and other documentation are verified. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   105  7.3.16.8.  Changes.  Reported deficiencies (MDRs, OCRs, or SPRs) by the partner or AF create  a  need  for  technical  change  requirements  to  the  EC  system.    A  screening  panel, consisting  of  ECISAP  engineers,  the  system  logistics  manager,  the  system  equipment specialist,  and  (when  permitted)  the  partner  EC  representative,  convenes  a  technical coordination meeting (TCM) to establish the total planning of a system software update.  The screening panel will review all deficiencies for priority, applicability, and feasibility of inclusion in the current software update cycle or block cycle.  On acceptance, the panel presents  the  total  update  package,  with  cost  and  schedule,  to  gain  approval  before beginning the engineering task. 7.3.16.9.  ECISAP Reviews.  Because the nature of EC system discussions generally are classified  and  partner  confidentiality  is  a  prime  goal,  reviews  normally  will  consist  of specific  country-to-ECISAP  dialogue.  TCMs concerning partner programs  will be held at  WR-ALC,  Georgia  and  in-country  during  kit-proofing  visits.    These  TCMs  provide opportunities for specific system reviews and when used with PMRs, SAMRs, etc., allow the desired ECISAP-country interface. 7.3.17.  ECISAP Responsibilities. 7.3.17.1.  SAF/IAPD serves as the focal point for data emitter .  Threat data requests are reviewed  by  SAF/IAPD  and  passed  to  the  appropriate  USG  agency.    The  resulting database is provided to the ECISAP organizations to support software development. 7.3.17.2.  542  Combat  Sustainment  Group  and  36  EWS  provide  the  MD  code  for  FMS and  security  assistance  EC  systems.    This  code  is  based  on  inputs  from  the  partner  and from  US  intelligence,  operational,  test  and  support  agencies.    WR-ALC  also  provides corresponding  OFP,  support tool  software,  support  equipment  software,  and documentation to the ECISAP member. 7.3.17.3.  ECISAP  Manpower.    Each  ECISAP  line  in  an  LOA  must  have  its  own Manpower Review Package (MRP) submitted through the Security Assistance Manpower Requirements  System  (SAMRS)  for  SAF/IAPX  approval.    Any  other  format  is  not permitted.  ECISAP manpower requirements cannot be consolidated into one MRP. 7.3.17.4.  ECISAP  workload  is  ―defined  order‖  per  individual  LOA  and  not  a  special manpower  aggregate  program  similar  to  Technical  Coordination  Programs  (TCPs)  and International Engine Management Programs (IEMPs).  Each workload must be identified with required man-years. 7.4.  International Engine Management Program (IEMP). 7.4.1.  The IEMP is an AF program under which individual groups manage or monitor engine follow-on  logistics  and  engineering  technical  services.    It  only  applies  to  AF-managed engines  and  to  security  assistance  countries  that  choose  to  participate  in  the  program.  Membership in the  IEMP is  for a minimum  of three (3)  years and  LOAs will be written to reflect a period of 1-36 months.  No exception to this guidance is allowed.  The IEMP is a cost sharing program; therefore, membership must be stable to ensure maximum benefits to all members.  Further, multi-year memberships ensure uninterrupted support. 7.4.2.  General IEMP Information.   106  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 7.4.2.1.  The purchase price of an engine does not include IEMP costs.  IEMP cost covers sustainment management of technical, engineering, and logistics support services.  IEMP membership is on a shared-cost basis, depending on the number of engines the member possesses  at  the  beginning  of  the  program  year.    FMS  countries  that  have  not  taken delivery  of  an  engine(s)  item  or  participation  in  the  IEMP  are  not  eligible  for  pro  rata sharing that IEMP member countries receive. 7.4.2.2.  Security  assistance  partners  do  not  have  to  take  part  in  the  IEMP  to  purchase engines, but are encouraged to join.  IEMP members benefit from the experience of users worldwide  through  the  USG  Component  Improvement  Program  (CIP)  and  security assistance-dedicated sustainment support management. 7.4.2.3.  Because the IEMP is a technical, logistics, and engineering sustainment support service program, it is applicable to engines currently owned by member countries. 7.4.2.4.  To  ensure  smooth  transition  from  acquisition  to  sustainment  support,  countries are  encouraged  to  join  the  IEMP  managed  and  operated  by  the  Oklahoma  City  Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC).  Standard IEMP membership is based on a pro rata formula and FMS partner engine inventory.  However, some security assistance partners involved in  the  acquisition  and  fielding  of  an  engine  may  seek  upfront  assistance,  information, technical  data  and  other  support  services  necessary  to  smoothly  transition  their  active forces  and  facilities  to  accommodate  ownership  in  advance  of  delivery.    Security assistance  partners  that  desire  pre-delivery  assistance  must  document  any  special requirements  or  services  they  need  in  a  Letter  of  Request  (LOR)  and  submit  them  for processing.  FMS countries will be directed to the appropriate program office for weapon system pre-delivery support information.  The propulsion program office will provide all of  the  engine  pre-delivery  support  necessary  to  meet  FMS  partner  needs.    Any  IEMP currently  providing  pre-delivery  support  services  will  cease  and  desist  as  soon  as  their current  program  support  arrangements  have  concluded  and  no  further  pre-delivery agreements of any kind will be negotiated with potential IEMP member countries.  Costs associated with tasks, activities, and support benefiting all IEMP members will be billed to  them  on  a  pro  rata  basis.    Costs  associated  with  tasks,  activities  and  support  for  an individual IEMP member partner will be billed in full to that member separately. 7.4.3.  IEMP Organization. 7.4.3.1.  Because  the  IEMP  is  funded  by  FMS  members,  the  IEMP  will  be  readily identifiable,  both  by  name  and  function,  within  the  ALC  organizational  structure.    The IEMP is a separate organization dedicated exclusively to the service of FMS purchasers.  This ensures proper utilization of foreign-owned materiel, assets, and funds. 7.4.3.2.  The  IEMP  has  authority  to  directly  interface  with  other  ALC  branches  and appropriate engine managers. 7.4.3.3.  The IEMP has a dedicated chief. 7.4.3.4.  The  IEMP  staff  is  composed  of  logistical,  technical,  engineering,  and  clerical personnel.  O&M-funded personnel will not be assigned to the IEMP.  Dedicated IEMP personnel will not be matrixed out. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   107  7.4.3.5.  Only personnel assigned to the IEMP, or certified by the IEMP chief as directly augmenting  the  IEMP,  are  authorized  to  use  line  item  case  funds.    Under  no circumstances  will  any  costs  relating  to  the  IEMP  be  borne  by  the  USG,  nor  will  the partner bear any cost related to AF activity. 7.4.3.6.  Direct communications between the IEMP and member countries are authorized and encouraged.  IEMPs will ensure that CCMs are advised as appropriate. 7.4.3.7.  AFSAC/XP  will  conduct  an  annual  review  of  each  IEMP.    Periodic  status reports  may  be  requested  as  required.    In  addition,  major  issues  (e.g.,  fleet  groundings that  affect  foreign  aircraft)  will  be  reported  to  AFSAC/XP  with  an  information  copy  to SAF/IAPX as soon as they occur, with updates every 30 days until the issue is resolved. 7.4.4.  IEMP  Functions.    The  IEMP  is  the  security  assistance  member's  single  point  of contact  (POC)  for  technical  and  logistical  sustainment  support,  to  include  the  CIP.    The IEMP monitors logistics support and takes action to correct problems.  The IEMP will ensure that  partner  requests,  for  which  the  IEMP  is  not  responsible,  are  forwarded  to  the  proper office of primary responsibility (OPR) for action. 7.4.5.

Issuing an official memorandum of impending partner membership lapse to the  AFSAC  CCM  and  CM  90  days  prior  to  expiration  of  an  IEMP  LOA.    Add  the TCP/IEMP  Coordinator,  AFSAC/XP,  as  an  information  copy  addressee  on  these notifications.    These  memorandums  must  advise  the  recipients  of  the  potential termination  of  IEMP  support  services  upon  expiration  of  the  member  partner’s current  case  and  without  full  implementation  of  a  follow-on  case.    In  addition,  the memorandum shall request the CCM to alert the member partner of this potential loss of IEMP service.  A final follow-up will be issued by the IEMP 30 days  prior to the expiration of the current case, advising the CCM of IEMP service suspension on the effective LOA period of performance end date.  The IEMPs are organic elements of AFMC  and  are  authorized  to  interact  administratively  and  technically  with  all  staff agencies  within  AFMC,  the  Air  Logistics  Centers  (ALCs),  Aeronautical  System Center (ASC), AFSAC, and applicable engine contractors. 7.4.5.4.  The  IEMP  manages  the  CIP  for  proven  aircraft  engines  owned  by  security assistance  countries  for  proven  systems.  The  Air  Force  CIP  manager  provides  contract administration services. 7.4.6.  IEMP  Services.    The  IEMP,  through  the  propulsion  management  staff  and  the  CIP, accomplishes the following: 7.4.6.1.  Coordinates  and  interacts  with  the  applicable  offices  in  AFMC,  ASC,  and  the ALCs and AFSAC to support its members. 7.4.6.2.  Coordinates  the  development  of  follow-on  logistics  support  requirements designed for each member's needs with other AF activities. 7.4.6.3.

Initiates,  when  appropriate,  engineering  of  new  support  equipment  for  new parts, accessories, or maintenance and inspection functions. 7.4.7.  IEMP  Service  and  Functions  Not  Provided.    The  IEMP  does  not  provide  the following functions or services: 7.4.7.1.  Increased  basic  engine  performance  beyond  that  found  in  the  engine  model specification (for example, thrust, specific fuel consumption, and weight). 7.4.7.2.  Labor  beyond  that  necessary  for  CIP  service  evaluation  testing,  unless specifically funded by the LOA.   110  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 7.4.7.3.  Engineering support for the engine production process. 7.4.7.4.  Data necessary for the manufacture of engines or changes to them. 7.4.7.5.  Inspection activities of any kind. 7.4.7.6.  Training  requirements.    Requests  for  training  should  be  made  to  AFSAT/CC, Randolph AFB, Texas. 7.4.7.7.  Routine requisition follow-up;  AFSAC provides requisition follow-up. 7.4.7.8.  CIP data for non-IEMP members. 7.4.7.9.  TO status information.  A partner's request for TO status information should be sent to the OC-ALC Security Assistance Technical Order Office (OC-ALC/ENGLC) TO publications  case  line  manager,  IAW  TO  00-5-19,  Security  Assistance  Technical  Order Program (Technical Manual). 7.4.7.10.  Configuration  control. configuration of its engines. 7.4.8.  Engine CIP.   It  is  the  purchaser's  responsibility  to  manage 7.4.8.1.  The  AF  CIP  manager  manages  the  CIP  on  behalf  of  the  propulsion  product group manager (PPGM)  for aircraft  engines owned by both  the  AF  and  FMS countries.  The  CIP,  funds  follow-on  engineering  efforts  to  improve  engine  safety,  reliability, maintainability,  and  serviceability  (improved  parts,  maintenance  techniques,  increased inspection intervals, modifications, etc.). 7.4.8.2.  The  purpose  of  the  CIP  is  to  improve  safety,  reliability,  maintainability,  and serviceability.   The  CIP  is  not  intended  to  expand  basic  engine  performance characteristics  (e.g.,  thrust  beyond  engine  specifications).    CIPs  are  specific  to  engine type.    The  major  advantage  of  the  CIP  to  the  security  assistance  partner  is  that,  by contributing a fair share of the total cost of a CIP, each participating member realizes the benefits of the total worldwide experiences of that engine. 7.4.8.3.  CIP benefits are available only to IEMP participants.  USG CIP information will not be available to countries that purchase engines through DCS unless they take part in the IEMP.  Non-members will not receive CIP technical data and will not be allowed to purchase parts and/or equipment funded through the CIP program. 7.4.8.4.  The  AF  CIP  manager  determines  program  funding  requirements  each  year, receives approval from an executive engine advisory group, and initiates action to award an  annual  support  contract  to  the  prime  engine  manufacturer.    Security  assistance countries  fund  their  membership  in  each  CIP  through  the  LOA  process  by  a  line implemented to the IEMP. 7.4.8.5.  The  nature  and  function  of  each  engine  CIP  requires  that  the  program  be conducted  on  a improvement requirements.    All  engine  operators  benefit  from  the  resultant  analyses,  testing,  user reports, improved parts/equipment, new authorized repair procedures, etc. long-term  basis,  because  of  continuous  engine 7.4.9.  Engineering Project and Proposal Process.  When a reported engine problem needs to be corrected, the contractor prepares an engineering project description (EPD).  The EPD AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   111  must  include  a  brief  description  of  the  problem  and  a  general  description  of  proposed corrective measures. 7.4.9.1.  The  CIP  manager  will  review  the  contractor's  EPDs  and  will  approve  the engineering work needed to prepare the engineering change proposal (ECP).  The IEMP will inform program members of releasable ECPs.  Program members should send their comments and recommendations for ECPs to the applicable IEMP.  The System Support Manager/Development  Support  Manager  (SSM/DSM)  approves  all  ECPs  except  those ECPs  that  are  member-unique.    If  requested,  the  SSM/DSM  reviews  member-unique ECPs  and  provides  technical  approval  and  recommendations  to  members  through  the IEMP. 7.4.9.2.  The engine CIP can address purchaser-unique problems; however, depending on the  scope  and  complexity  involved,  the  resolution  of  partner-specific  problems  may require a separate LOA to fund the effort. 7.4.9.3.  If  a  member  requests  the  development  of  an  ECP,  the  IEMP  will  determine whether the change applies to other members and, if so, will encourage the development of the ECP on a cost-sharing basis.  Program members who accept an ECP and provide separate  spares  funding  may  benefit  from  reduced  acquisition  costs  as  a  result  of consolidated procurement.  Routine changes are issued for part numbered items that are attrited due to the ECPs, which have been accepted for use in USAF engines. As a rule, the Air Force does not stock parts to support engine changes that are not in the Air Force engine inventory. 7.4.9.4.  Program  members  have  final  acceptance  authority  for  implementing  ECPs  in their fleet after the SSM/DSM approves the CIP ECP and the IEMP releases the ECP. 7.4.9.5.  AF-published  time  compliance  technical  orders  (TCTOs)  are  issued  after  a retrofit  ECP  is  approved.    Routine  changes  are  issued  for  part  numbers  that  are  attrited due to ECPs that have been accepted for use in AF engines. 7.4.10.  Technology Restrictions and Foreign Disclosure.  The IEMP will coordinate with the  local  FDO  if  technology  restrictions  are  applicable  to  advanced  engines,  engineering change  proposals,  or  modifications.    The  FDO  will  review  the  delegation  of  disclosure authority letter (DDL) and other release guidelines.  If no guideline or letter exists, a request for  determination  will  be  processed  through  AFSAC  FDO  (AFSAC/XPJ).    SAF/IAPD  will make final determination on all IEMP disclosure issues when requested by AFSAC/XPJ. 7.4.11.  IEMP Reviews.  There are two types of reviews:  individual in-country reviews and within-CONUS  reviews.    The  agenda  will  include  a  review  of  projects  and  their  results, financial  statuses,  common  technical  problems  and  goals,  and  ways  of  improving  the program. 7.4.11.1.  CONUS reviews will occur on an as-required basis.  The AF CIP manager and IEMP will host the review.  All members are invited to attend USG-sponsored reviews.  Security assistance members are responsible for their own travel costs.  Travel expenses for countries cannot be included in LOAs. 7.4.11.2.  Individual partner reviews are held in the partner's country when requested.  In-country  reviews  are  encouraged  because  they  provide  cross-feed  of  information  at  the   112  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 working level.  AF participation is funded through the appropriate IEMP LOA or through a separate LOA. 7.4.12.  FMS Cases for IEMP. 7.4.12.1.  For  engines  managed  by  ASC  that  are  still  in  the  early  stages  of  production, fielding/deployment, and operational support, participation in the CIP will be a condition of sale and will be included in the supporting "S" case. 7.4.12.2.  Members can  comment  on ECPs or similar program  items; however, only the DSM may approve ECPs. 7.4.12.3.  For  engines  under  the  cognizance  of  the  ALC,  participation  in  the  IEMP  is encouraged.  If a partner chooses to take part in the IEMP, the LOA should be processed as a "G" case. 7.4.12.4.  The  partner  must  submit  an  LOR  defining  their  requirements  and  whether  to amend the current case or write a new LOA to the AFSAC CCM no later than (NLT) six months prior to the expiration date of the current case.  The CCM will validate the LOR and  input  the  appropriate  data  into  the  Defense  Security  Agency  Management  System (DSAMS) and task the CM to obtain the LOA data (LOAD) from the IEMP. 7.4.12.5.  LOAs  will  include  a  statement  informing  each  member  that  they  are responsible for travel and per diem expenses necessary for their representatives to be at CONUS IEMP reviews, regional IEMP reviews, or in-country IEMP reviews. 7.4.12.6.  Notes  in  IEMP  LOAs  explain  the  services  available  to  the  partner  under  the IEMP, and state AF and member responsibilities.  These notes will also state any special requirements of the member. 7.4.12.7.  LOAs will have the following lines: 7.4.12.7.1.  Line 001:  CIP  - Contractor Services. 7.4.12.7.2.  Line  002: equipment, CONUS travel, etc.   Internal  Services  -  IEMP  salaries,  benefits,  supplies, 7.4.12.7.3.  Line  003:    Overseas  Travel  -  Funds  for  IEMP  personnel  travel  to  and from the IEMP member to conduct engine business, e.g., IEMP reviews.  This line is at the member’s option and is not a requirement to participate in the program.  Only personnel assigned to the IEMP or providing temporary direct technical support to the IEMP may use these funds.  This line is not intended for travel to CONUS of any in-country personnel, Security Cooperation Office (SCO) personnel, contractors, etc., in support of their individual partner. 7.4.12.7.4.  Line  004:    Contract  Services  -  Funds  for  engineering  or  technical assistance  that  exceed  the  IEMP  internal  capability,  which  may  include  contractor travel  to  technically  augment  the  IEMP.    Services  such  as  engineering  or  technical investigation,  and  printing  and  reproduction  of  data  may  also  be  funded  under  this line item.  This line is an option and is included at the discretion of the purchaser. 7.4.12.8.  A  statement  to  this  effect  will  be  included  in  the  notes  for  each  IEMP  LOA: IEMP participation is assumed to be a continuing requirement unless the partner's LOA signatory  authority  notifies  the  AFSAC  CM  (information  copy  to  the  IEMP,  SAF/IA AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   113  Country Director, SAF/IAPX, and AFSAC/XP) that they will no longer participate.  The notification period is 180 days prior to expiration of the current LOA to allow sufficient time to adjust pro rata shares for remaining countries. 7.4.12.9.  IEMP LOAs are typically ―G‖ cases, prepared, implemented and administered by AFSAC.  However, these services may be  provided as line items on other cases (i.e.  ―Q‖  or  ―S‖).    Any  IEMP  member  requirements  associated  with  Computer  Program Identification  Numbering  (CPINs),  CSTOs,  engineering  drawings,  software,  tactical manuals,  TOs,  and  technical  publications  (not  typically  TCP/IEMP  related)  must  be requested  by  IEMP  member  countries  on  ―P‖  cases  to  cover  production,  reproduction, and distribution.  IEMP country LORs should specify the dollar amounts by engine type and each must be designated as classified or unclassified.  Each IEMP is responsible for conducting  and  financially  managing  the  program.    All  lines  where  services  are administered by the IEMP will be implemented by the IEMP only. 7.4.12.10.  Only  the  IEMP  Chief  and  Financial  Manager  may  direct  the  line  item management responsibility or the expenditure of these funds. 7.4.13.  Determining IEMP Inventory. 7.4.13.1.  Individual  IEMP  chiefs  are  responsible  for  annually  verifying  respective member countries’ engine inventories as the basis for developing LOAs.  The individual IEMPs will request that their members (current and potential) provide a listing (to include engine serial numbers, model numbers, etc.) in writing, reflect anticipated inventories at the start of each program year.  The pro-rata share of a given IEMP or CIP for a specific program year is based on the total quantities of that engine in the inventory at the start of each program year. 7.4.13.2.  The criterion for including an item in the current year LOA inventory is that the engine or engine module is either currently capable or could in the future be capable of receiving  the  benefit  from  IEMP  membership.    Engines  in  the  following  conditions  are deemed  incapable  of  receiving  benefit  from  IEMP  membership  and  will  be  excluded from the inventory: 7.4.13.2.1.  Destroyed engines/modules. 7.4.13.2.2.  Static engine/module displays. 7.4.13.2.3.  Engines/modules  in  non-recoverable  storage  (those  not  protected  against deterioration). 7.4.13.2.4.  Engines/modules designated for long-term parts cannibalization. 7.4.13.3.  The IEMP chief is the final authority on whether an engine will be included in a member’s chargeable inventory.  If inventory quantities are not provided by a member in  a  timely  manner,  the  previous  year’s  inventory,  plus  or  minus  any  documented changes, will be used. 7.4.13.3.1.  Requiring  IEMP  financial  management  personnel  to  adjust  every  time member  partner’s  inventory  increases  or  decreases  results  in  adjusting  all  member countries  pro  rata  fees  intermittently.    The  potential  for  constantly  adjusting  IEMP budget  can  have  serious  consequences  that  adversely  impact  budgetary  planning, budget execution, and contract funding.  The frequency of member partner inventory   114  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 adjustments  could  promote  turmoil  in  IEMP  communities  and  pose  problems  for individual partner members who would be forced to deal with constantly fluctuating pro rata fees throughout the year. 7.4.13.3.2.  Members need to provide inventory adjustments in conjunction with their LOR submissions. 7.4.13.3.3.  Financial adjustments for both inventory increases and reductions will be accomplished during the subsequent program year. 7.4.14.  Determining IEMP Membership Cost. 7.4.14.1.  CIP  Rate.    The  CIP  rate  per  engine  is  determined  by  dividing  the  approved DoD CIP budget for each type, model, and series (TMS) of engine by the DoD inventory for each TMS engine for a given year.  This valuation method is depicted in the formula below: 7.4.14.2.  (DoD CIP Budget for each TMS of Engine)  / (DoD Inventory of each TMS Engine) = (DoD Rate per TMS of Engine). 7.4.14.3.  A partner's share is calculated by multiplying the DoD rate per TMS of engine by the partner's inventory  for  each TMS of engine for the  given period.  This  valuation method is depicted in the formula below: 7.4.14.3.1.  (DoD  Rate  per  TMS  of  Engine)  x  (Partner's  Inventory  for  each  TMS Engine) = (Partner's Share of CIP Cost). 7.4.14.4.  The total CIP cost for a given year is the sum of the DoD budget plus countries' contributed share. 7.4.15.  Nonparticipation in IEMP.  The following applies to eligible purchasers that do not join the IEMP. 7.4.15.1.  The AF may reject requisitions for engine parts and components improved by the CIP. 7.4.15.2.  Engine parts superseded by parts improved or changed by IEMP efforts are not restocked by the AF to support the previous configuration. 7.4.15.3.  The  overhaul  of  security  assistance  partner  engines  is  dependent  on  their participation  in  the  respective  IEMP.    Overhauled  engines  usually  receive  the  latest improvements resulting from that engine TMS’s CIP.  Because CIP components (parts or kits)  are  not  available  to  non-IEMP  members,  and  because  old  parts  may  no  longer  be stocked, there may be overhaul  delays until  an LOA is  signed to  fund the purchase and installation of CIP components. 7.4.15.4.  Nonparticipants are not eligible for the following benefits: 7.4.15.4.1.  Nonparticipants are not authorized to receive distribution of updated TOs that  result  from  IEMP.    TO  supplements,  changes,  or  revisions  that  result  from  the IEMP will not show a non-participant's engine configuration.  Non-participants may require development of CSTOs that exclude IEMP changes.  Development of CSTOs requires a separate case line item. 7.4.15.4.2.  Nonparticipants will not receive TCTOs and kits developed by the IEMP. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   115  7.4.15.4.3.  Nonparticipants will not receive IEMP technical data, including ECPs and IEMP meeting minutes. 7.4.15.4.4.  Nonparticipants  will  not  receive  data  for  new  or  improved  maintenance practices, or extension of inspection and overhaul  intervals  developed by  the engine CIP. 7.4.15.4.5.  Nonparticipants  will  not  receive  technical  assistance  that  is  routinely provided under IEMP. 7.4.15.4.6.  Nonparticipants cannot attend engine reviews. 7.4.16.  Engine Safety. 7.4.16.1.  Non-Hostile  Partners.    All  non-hostile  engine  purchasers  are  informed  of engine flight safety hazards by the SSM/DSM.  However, safety flight TCTOs and repair procedures  are  only  sent  to  IEMP  member  countries.    The  IEMP  chief  will  ensure  that SCOs  are  included  as  information  addressees  on  all  safety  of  flight  TCTO  messages  in their  respective  countries.    The  intent  is  to  keep  the  SCOs  informed  of  the  status  of aircraft, engines, and missiles owned by the partners. 7.4.16.2.  Suspended  Partners.    Partners  that  are  suspended  (but  non-hostile)  will normally  be  provided  safety  of  flight  information  unless  direction  to  the  contrary  is issued  by  SAF/IA.    Suspended  partners  may  receive  safety-of-flight  information  only; they  cannot  receive  items,  including  kits  to  correct  a  safety  problem,  or  other  services.  There can be no contact at all with hostile countries. 7.4.17.  Engine  Contractors.    If  an  IEMP  non-member  goes  directly  to  a  contractor  to purchase CIP-type services, the contractor will not provide CIP information developed under the USG CIP or IEMP.  The IEMP will inform prime engine and engine overhaul contractors about AF IEMP policy. 7.4.18.  IEMP  Manpower.  IEMP manpower requirements will be validated IAW standard MRP submission procedure using off-line MRP format as shown in Attachment 4. 7.5.  Aircraft/Missile Technical Coordination Program (TCP). 7.5.1.  The  TCPs  are  USAF  international  affairs  activities.    TCPs  provide  follow-on sustainment  support  services  (technical,  engineering  and  logistics  assistance)  for  aircraft, missile,  precision  attack  pods,  and  related  equipment.    The  TCP  does  not  expand  the  basic performance (mission, design, and series) of a given type of system beyond that performance stated  in  its  configuration  item  specification,  except  when  permitted  by  SAF/IAPX.    TCPs are  AFMC  programs;  AFSAC/XP  establishes  guidance,  provides  program  direction  and oversight,  and  conducts  annual  program  reviews.    SAF/IAPX  provides  final  approval  for forming, revising, and disbanding the program group.  Each TCP is responsible for program performance  and  financial  management  of  the  program.    Since  the  TCP  is  a  sustainment technical support program, it is applicable to aircraft and missile systems after delivery to the partner or  as otherwise  directed.   Requests  for  waivers or deviations to  guidance should  be sent in writing to AFSAC/XP. 7.5.2.  General TCP Information.   116  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 7.5.2.1.  The purchase price of aircraft or missile systems does not include TCP follow-on technical  support  costs.    TCP  cost  covers  sustainment  management  of  technical, engineering,  and  logistics  support  services.    TCP  membership  exists  on  a  shared  basis, depending  on  the  number  of  aircraft  or  missile  systems  a  member  possesses  at  the beginning of the program year. 7.5.2.2.  Standard  TCP  membership  is  based  on  a  pro  rata  of  FMS  partner  weapon system,  missile,  or  end  item  inventory.    However,  some  security  assistance  partners involved  in  the  acquisition  and  fielding  of  a  weapon  system,  missile,  or  end  item  may seek upfront assistance, information, technical data and other support services necessary to  smoothly  transition  their  active  forces  and  facilities  to  accommodate  ownership  in advance of delivery.  Security assistance partners that desire pre-delivery assistance must document  any  special  requirements  or  services  they  need  in  an  LOR  and  submit  it  for processing.    The  program  office  will  provide  all  of  the  weapon  system,  missile,  or  end item  pre-delivery  support  necessary  to  meet  FMS  partner  needs.    TCPs  are  strictly technical,  engineering,  and  logistics  sustainment  support  service  activities.    FMS countries that have not taken delivery of a weapon system or end item are not eligible for pro rata sharing that TCP member countries receive. 7.5.2.3.  Per  an  agreement  reached  at  the  2008  TCP/IEMP  Chiefs  Meeting,  FMS countries  will  be  directed  to  the  appropriate  program  office  for  weapon  system  pre-delivery support information.  Any TCP currently providing pre-delivery support services will  cease  and  desist  as  soon  as  their  current  program  support  arrangements  have concluded  and  no  further  pre-delivery  agreements  of  any  kind  will  be  negotiated  with potential TCP member countries. 7.5.2.4.  Security  assistance  partners  do  not  have  to  join  the  TCP  to  purchase  aircraft, missiles,  low  altitude  navigation  and  targeting  infrared  for  night  (LANTIRN)  system, LITENING or Sniper pods, but are encouraged to do so.  The TCP aids  its members in improving the serviceability, maintainability, and reliability of covered items (improved parts  and  maintenance intervals, modifications, etc.). inspection  and  overhaul techniques, improved 7.5.2.5.  Costs associated with tasks, activities, and support benefiting all TCP members will  be  billed  to  them  on  a  pro  rata  basis.    Costs  associated  with  tasks,  activities  and support for an individual TCP member will be billed in full to that member separately. 7.5.3.  TCP Organization. 7.5.3.1.  Because  the  TCP  is  funded  by  FMS  members,  the  TCP  will  be  readily identifiable,  both  by  name  and  function,  within  the  ALC  organizational  structure.    The TCP  is  a  separate  organization  dedicated  exclusively  to  the  service  of  countries.    This ensures proper utilization of TCP member-owned materiel, assets, and funds. 7.5.3.2.  The TCP has a dedicated chief. 7.5.3.3.  The  TCP  staff  is  comprised  of  engineering,  logistical,  technical,  and  clerical personnel.    O&M-funded  personnel  will  not  be  assigned  to  the  TCP.    Dedicated  TCP personnel will not be matrixed out. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   117  7.5.3.4.  The  TCP  has  authority  to  directly  interface  with  other  ALC  activities  and managers. 7.5.3.5.  Only  personnel  assigned  to  the  TCP,  or  certified  by  the  TCP  chief  as  directly augmenting the TCP, are authorized to use line item case funds.  Under no circumstances will any costs relating to the TCP be borne by the USG, nor will the partner bear any cost related to AF activity. 7.5.3.6.  Direct  communications  between  the  TCP  and  member  countries  is  authorized and encouraged.  TCPs will ensure that CMs are advised as appropriate. 7.5.3.7.  AFSAC/XP will conduct an annual review of each TCP.  Periodic status reports may  be  requested.    In  addition,  major  issues  (e.g.,  fleet  groundings  that  affect  foreign aircraft) will be reported to AFSAC/XP with an information copy to SAF/IAPX as soon as they occur, with updates every 30 days until the issue is resolved. 7.5.4.  TCP  Managerial  Responsibilities.    The  TCP  is  a  SAF/IA  program,  delegated  to AFSAC/XP for implementation and execution. 7.5.4.1.  SAF/IA will perform the following TCP functions: 7.5.4.1.1.  Provide final approval for forming, revising, and disbanding programs. 7.5.4.1.2.  Oversee the program. 7.5.4.2.  AFSAC/XP will perform the following TCP functions: 7.5.4.2.1.  Establish guidance. 7.5.4.2.2.  Approve waivers to or deviations from established guidance. 7.5.4.2.3.  Provide program direction and oversight. 7.5.4.2.4.  Define the scope of each program. 7.5.4.2.5.  Conduct annual program reviews. 7.5.4.2.6.  Observe annual reviews conducted by the TCPs. 7.5.4.3.  The TCP chief will perform the following functions: 7.5.4.3.1.  Program performance of his/her program. 7.5.4.3.2.  Request  waivers  or  deviations  to  established  guidance  from  AFSAC/XP with informational copy to SAF/IAPX. 7.5.4.3.3.  Supervise the TCP staff. 7.5.4.3.4.  Responsible for office equipment, resources, and supplies. 7.5.4.3.5.  Financial management of FMS case funds. 7.5.4.3.6.  Provide  the  AFSAC  CM  with  an  excess  funds  drawdown  letter  no  later than 60 days of the case expiration date. 7.5.4.3.7.  Issuing an official memorandum of impending partner membership lapse to the  AFSAC  CCM  and  CM  90  days  prior  to  expiration  of  a  TCP  LOA.    Add  the TCP/IEMP  Coordinator,  AFSAC/XP,  as  an  information  copy  addressee  on  these notifications.    These  memorandums  must  advise  the  recipients  of  the  potential   118  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 termination of TCP support services upon expiration of the member partner’s current case  and  without  full  implementation  of  a  follow-on  case.    In  addition,  the memorandum shall request the CCM to alert the member partner of this potential loss of  TCP  service.    A  final  follow-up  will  be  issued  by  the  TCP  30  days  prior  to  the expiration  of  the  current  case,  advising  the  CCM  of  TCP  service  suspension  on  the effective LOA period of performance end date. 7.5.5.  TCP  Functions.    The  TCP  is  the  security  assistance  member's  single  POC  for technical  sustainment  support  in  maintaining,  modifying  (including  repair  assistance  and contracting  for  actual  repairs),  and  operating  its  aircraft  and  missiles  systems.    Issues concerning aircraft engines will be referred to the International Engine Management Program (IEMP).  The TCP will ensure that partner requests for which the TCP is not responsible are forwarded  to  the  proper  OPR  for  action.    In  addition,  the  TCP  performs  the  following functions: 7.5.5.1.  Coordinates  and  interacts  with  the  applicable  offices  in  AFMC,  ASC,  and  the ALCs and AFSAC to support its members. 7.5.5.2.  Notifies  members  of  safety  problems.    The  TCP  ensures  that  each  program member has a current address to which it may report safety hazards or other problems. 7.5.5.3.  Researches and recommends solutions to flight safety problems. 7.5.6.  Functions Not Provided.  The TCP does not provide the following functions: 7.5.6.1.  Production  or  modification  hardware  kits  or  maintenance  labor  (with  the exception of TCPs providing program or logistics management support for procurement of modification kits using FMS partner Mod Case funds). 7.5.6.2.  Engineering support to the production process. 7.5.6.3.  Training  requirements.    Requests  for  training  should  be  sent  to  AFSAT, Randolph AFB, Texas. 7.5.6.4.  P&A or LOA data studies for modifications, unless requested through DSAMS. 7.5.6.5.  Release of data not currently a configuration of the member partner's account. 7.5.6.6.  Inspection activity of any kind. 7.5.6.7.  Configuration  control. configuration.   It is the  purchaser's  responsibility to  manage 7.5.6.8.  TO status information.  A partner's request for TO status information should be sent to the OC-ALC/ENGLC, TO publications case line manager, in accordance with TO 00-5-19. 7.5.6.9.  Routine requisition follow-up; AFSAC provides requisition follow-up. 7.5.7.  TCP Services.  The TCP provides the following common services.  Member countries desiring additional services must submit an LOR and bear any additional associated costs. 7.5.7.1.  Maintenance  data.    The  TCP  responds  to  requests  in  areas  of  data  analysis, maintenance  standardization,  maintenance  data  collection  (MDC),  and  programmed AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   119  depot  maintenance  (PDM).    Additionally,  the  TCP  may  provide  guidance  to  establish member-specific maintenance management programs. 7.5.7.2.  Deficiency  reports  (IAW  Chapter  5,  TO  00-35D-54)  for  applicable  items  and related equipment. 7.5.7.3.  Spares support.  Technical guidance for follow-on non-standard item support.   Development  of individual 7.5.7.4.  Modifications. (in coordination  with  members)  for  released  modifications.    Approved  modifications  offer cost-effective  ways  to  improve  weapon  systems  or  to  correct  materiel  deficiencies.  Specifically,  modifications  that  can  improve  system  performance,  reliability,  and maintainability or adapt systems to meet new or changing threats. implementation  plans 7.5.7.5.  Technical data.  The maintenance of a library of its members’ CSTO. 7.5.7.5.1.  TCPs may assume management responsibility for TOs and TO updates no longer  used  by  the  DoD.    The  transfer  of  responsibility  will  be  made  by  agreement with the SPD and the TCP chief. 7.5.7.5.2.  Country  Standard  TOs  managed  by  the  TCP  may  be  contractually supported under an additional case line item. 7.5.7.5.3.  The  TCP  will  ensure  procedures  are  followed  to  provide  interim, operational, and safety technical orders to member countries. 7.5.7.6.  The  TCP  is  the  USAF  single  POC  to  ensure  input,  processing,  evaluation  and reporting status of Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 22 , Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation and Reply,  applicable  to  USAF and  country standard items  is submitted by member countries. 7.5.7.7.  Configuration  Status  Accounting.    On  request,  the  TCP  will  assist  member countries in establishing a configuration management system.  The system will enable an audit  of  TCTO  compliance,  by  aircraft,  LANTIRN,  LITENING,  and  Sniper  pod  serial number,  based  on  data  provided  by  the  partner.    Configuration  accounting  is  not applicable to missiles. 7.5.7.8.  Technical Problem Resolution.  The TCP will evaluate and recommend solutions to  problems  identified  by  the  members.    The  TCP  will  communicate  such  information directly  to  members  for  problem  prevention  or  correction.    The  TCP  investigates, analyzes,  and  resolves  service-revealed  difficulties  or  problems  reported  by  the  TCP members.  TCP accepts problems identified by the following means: 7.5.7.8.1.  Deficiency reports (IAW Chapter 5, TO 00-35D-54). 7.5.7.8.2.  Accident and incident reports. 7.5.7.8.3.  Reports to contractor representatives. 7.5.7.8.4.  Reports from WSLOs. 7.5.7.8.5.  Other AF personnel’s written or oral reports through the TCP chief. 7.5.8.  Technology  Restrictions  and  Foreign  Disclosure.    If  there  are  technology restrictions  or  other  restrictive  guidance  on  Engineering  Change  Proposals  (ECPs)  or   120  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 modifications,  TCP  personnel  must  consult  the  DDL  and  other  release  guidelines.    If  no written  guidance  exists,  consult  with  the  local  FDO  and/or  SAF/IAPD  for  international technology release guidelines. 7.5.9.  Engineering  Technical  Changes  for  Aircraft/Missile  Systems  or  Subsystems.  Initiating  Engineering  Services  Task  (EST)  contracts  and  the  release  of  applicable  source data  will  be  accomplished  when  the  evaluation  of  reported  problems  indicate  corrective action  is  necessary.    If  a  problem  is  beyond  both  TCP  and  other  USAF  engineering capabilities, it is referred to a contractor who prepares EST contracts. EST contracts include a brief description of the problem and a general description of the proposed corrective action. ESTs  that  are  accepted  by  participating  countries  will  result  in  developing  corrective measures, which are then reported in related ECPs. Copies of the ESTs and ECPs are sent to each  TCP  member  for  review  and  possible  acceptance  for  their  weapon  system.    TCP comments and recommendations accompany each EST and ECP. 7.5.9.1.  Upon a contractor submission of an EST, the TCP reviews the engineering effort needed to prepare the ECP and makes recommendations before sending it to the member countries  for  approval.    TCP  member  countries  then  furnish  their  own  comments  and recommendations  on  the  EST  and  ECP  to  the  TCP.    Normally,  a  TCP  will  provide  its member countries with additional help or consultation with the EST and ECP evaluation process when requested. 7.5.9.2.  The  TCP  will  try  to  consolidate  like  requirements  from  members  with  a  given ECP.  Member country peculiar requirements may call for changes to the ECP and result in  increased  individual  member  country  cost.    The  addition  of  country  peculiar requirements  and  associated  cost  increases  must  be  funded  and  paid  by  the  applicable member country. 7.5.9.3.  An  individual  member  country  recommending  an  additional  requirement  that benefits  other  program  participants  and  adds  new  program  costs  will  be  shared  by  all member countries accepting the ECP change. 7.5.9.4.  An individual member country requesting the development of an ECP can result in  the  TCP  determining  that  it  applies  to  other  members  and  championing  its  full  or partial member group acceptance on a cost-sharing basis.  Member countries that initially reject  a  proposed  ECP,  but  later  request  the  completed  ECP,  will  be  charged  an appropriate  nonrecurring  cost  to  recoup  the  fees  necessary  to  credit  other  participating member countries’ investment in this development effort. 7.5.9.4.1.  The  TCP  reviews  and  makes  recommendations,  from  a  technical standpoint,  to  ECPs  that  result  from  the  aircraft/missile/attack  pod  member  projects and  makes  them    available  to  affected  partner  program  members  for  review  and possible  acceptance.    TCTOs  and  Country  Standard  Time  Compliance  Technical Orders (CSTCTOs) are issued as applicable in accordance with TO 00-5-19 reviews. 7.5.10.  TCP  Reviews.    There  are  two  types  of  reviews:    worldwide  reviews  (WWR)  and individual in-country reviews.  The agenda will include a review of projects and their results, financial  statuses,  common  technical/maintenance  problems  and  goals,  and  ways  of improving the program. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   121  7.5.10.1.  The WWR will occur on an as-required basis.  The TCP will host the review.  All members are invited to attend USG-sponsored reviews.  Security assistance members are  responsible  for  their  own  travel  costs.    Travel  expenses  for  countries  cannot  be included in LOAs. 7.5.10.1.1.  Disclosure  guidance  for  TCP  WWRs.    TCP  WWRs  are  USG-sponsored meetings.    The  TCP  chief  is  responsible  for  the  review  and  approval  of  briefings given  at  WWRs  and  for  appropriate  contractor  participation  during  WWRs.  Responsibility  for  compliance  with  foreign  disclosure  guidance  remains  with  each TCP  chief  through  the  local  FDO.    If  the  TCP  chief  wishes  to  allow  a  non-USG-sponsored  forum  for  contractors  to  brief  or  have  discussions  with  countries,  the following conditions must be met: 7.5.10.1.2.  The USG-sponsored meeting must be separate and distinct from the non-USG-sponsored meeting. 7.5.10.1.3.  Foreign  attendees  must  be  made  aware  through  a  disclaimer,  or  other means, of what is USG-sponsored and what is not sponsored by the USG. 7.5.10.1.4.  Contractors  must  ensure  that  they  have  an  export  license  for  each attending partner or that their legal departments have determined that the information to be briefed, discussed, and provided on handouts does not require an export license.  A  copy  of  the  determination  will  be  provided  in  writing  to  the  TCP  prior  to  the meeting.  The TCP chief will maintain a file of letters from participating contractors that they are in compliance. 7.5.10.1.5.  An  agenda  for  the  WWR  will  be  provided  to  AFSAC/XP  no  later  than two weeks prior to the meeting.  AFSAC/XP will not be responsible for clearing the agenda but will be available for consultation upon request. 7.5.10.2.  Individual  in-country  reviews  are  held  in  the  member’s  country  when requested.    In-country  reviews  are  encouraged  because  they  provide  a  cross-feed  of information at the working level and provide for a maximum number of partner personnel to attend and benefit from the reviews, as well as actively contribute to the program.  As determined by the TCP chief, AF personnel may be funded through the appropriate TCP LOA line, to participate on in-country reviews if deemed necessary, in order to augment the TCP team’s technical, engineering, or logistics service functions. 7.5.11.  FMS Cases for TCP. 7.5.11.1.  TCP  LOAs  are  typically  ―G‖  cases,  prepared,  implemented  and  administered by  AFSAC;  however,  these  services  may  be  provided  as  line  items  on  other  cases  (i.e. ―Q‖  or  ―S‖).    Any  TCP  member  requirements  associated  with  CPINs,  CSTOs, engineering drawings, joint munitions effectiveness manuals (JMEMs), software, tactical manuals,  TOs,  and  technical  publications  (not  typically  TCP/IEMP  related)  must  be requested by TCP member countries on ―P‖ cases to cover production, reproduction, and distribution.  TCP country LORs should specify the dollar amounts by aircraft, missile, or pod, and each must be designated as classified or unclassified.  Each TCP is responsible for  conducting  and  financially  managing  the  program.    All  lines  where  services  are administered by the TCP will be implemented by the TCP only.   122  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 7.5.11.2.  When a TCP member buys additional aircraft/missiles managed by the TCP, a new FMS case for the TCP is not required.  Instead, a statement will be included on the attachment  to  the  LOA  stating  the  purchaser  agrees  to  continue  participation  in  the aircraft/missile TCP. 7.5.11.3.  LOAs for aircraft/missiles  TCPs will include the following line items: 7.5.11.3.1.  Line  001  -  Internal  services  include  personnel  costs,  facilities,  supplies, CONUS  travel,  technical  publications,  and  equipment  for  the  exclusive  technical support of the participating security assistance countries.  The TCP is responsible for accountability of equipment. 7.5.11.3.2.  Line 002 - Contract services fund projects that exceed the TCP's internal capability  when requested by  the partner.   Services such as  contractual  engineering, technical  investigation  supports,  printing,  and  reproduction  of  data  may  be  funded under this line item. 7.5.11.3.3.  Line  003  -  Overseas  travel  surveys  funds  the  outside  continental  United States  (OCONUS)  travel  expenses  of  the  TCP  personnel  as  requested  by  and  in support  of  a  member.    Expenses  of  other  AF  technical  personnel  augmenting  the TCP, including salaries, are also reported on this line item.  This line is optional and is not required to participate in the program.  Only personnel assigned to the TCP or providing  temporary/direct  technical,  engineering,  or  specialized  logistics  support service expertise to the TCP may use these funds.  This line is not intended for travel to CONUS of any in-country personnel, SCO personnel, contractors, etc.,  in support of their individual partner. 7.5.11.4.  Lines  for  aircraft  structural  integrity  program  (ASIP),  site/safety  surveys, surveillance testing, modification teams, etc., may be added when approved by the TCP chief  and  implemented  to  the  TCP.    U.S.  non-TCP  government  personnel  and  FMS representatives may not direct the line item management responsibility or the expenditure of these funds. 7.5.12.  LOAs for TCPs. 7.5.12.1.  A TCP member must submit an LOR defining their requirements and whether to amend the current case or write a new LOA to the AFSAC CCM NLT six months prior to the expiration date of the current case.  The CCM will validate the LOR and input the appropriate data into DSAMS and task the CM to  obtain LOAD from the TCP.  This is necessary to ensure uninterrupted support. 7.5.12.2.  The LOA will state that it is each member's responsibility to budget for travel and  per  diem  expenses  for  their  personnel  to  attend  both  CONUS  and  in-country  TCP reviews.  These funds cannot be part of the LOA. 7.5.12.3.  The LOA will include a note that explains the services provided to the partner under the TCP, including AF responsibilities and partner's responsibilities to the program and requirements that are unique to the purchaser's program. 7.5.12.4.  TCP  participation  is  assumed  to  be  a  continuous  requirement  unless  the member partner's LOA signatory authority notifies the AFSAC CCM (information copy to the TCP, AFSAC/XP, the SAF/IA Country Director, and SAF/IAPX).  Notification to AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   123  terminate  TCP  membership  must  be  made  no  later  than  180  calendar  days  prior  to expiration of the current LOA.  An LOA Note will be included in the TCP LOA outlining this requirement. 7.5.13.  Membership.  Membership in the TCP is for a minimum of three  years and LOAs will be written to reflect a period of 1-36 months.  TCPs are cost sharing programs; therefore, membership must be stable to ensure maximum benefits to all members.  Furthermore, multi-year memberships ensure uninterrupted weapon system support. 7.5.14.  TCP  Costs.    TCP  members  must  share  program  costs  on  a  pro  rata  basis.    A participant's  share  of  TCP  cost  is  based  on  the  total  quantity  of  aircraft/missiles/precision attack pods possessed by a member at the beginning of the program year. 7.5.14.1.  TCP inventory and cost determination.  Individual TCP Chiefs are responsible for  annually  verifying  respective  member  countries’  aircraft/  missiles  inventories  as  the basis for developing LOAs.  The individual TCPs will request their members (current and potential)  to  provide  a  written  list  reflecting  anticipated  inventories  at  the  start  of  each program  year.    The  partner  confirmation  will  consist  of  a  listing  (e.g.,  aircraft  tail numbers or number of missiles) and configuration for accounting traceability.  The pro-rata share of a given TCP for a specific program year is based on the total quantities in the member’s inventory at the start of each program year.  If inventory quantities are not provided  in  a  timely  manner,  the  previous  year’s  inventory,  plus  or  minus  any documented changes, will be used. 7.5.14.2.  The criterion for including an item in the current year LOA inventory is that the aircraft/ missile/precision attack pod is currently capable or could in the future be capable of  receiving  benefit  from  TCP  membership.    Systems  in  the  following  statuses  are deemed incapable of receiving benefit of TCP membership: 7.5.14.2.1.  Destroyed units. 7.5.14.2.2.  Units  used  as  or  in  static  displays  (does  not  include  units  set  aside  or parked). 7.5.14.2.3.  Units deterioration). in  non-recoverable storage (units  not  protected  against 7.5.14.2.4.  Units designated for long-term parts cannibalization. 7.5.14.3.  Systems  undergoing  modification/PDM  will  continue  to  be  charged  pro  rata since  the  partner  may  require  assistance  from  the  TCP.    The  TCP  chief  is  the  final authority on whether a unit should be included in the LOA chargeable inventory. 7.5.14.4.  TCP  participation  will  also  include  aircraft/missiles  produced  in  a  partner’s country under license agreement with a US manufacturer.  Items produced under license agreement with a US manufacturer and supported by AF-managed TCPs are considered part of the worldwide TCP inventory. 7.5.15.  Inventory  requiring  TCP  financial  management  personnel  to  adjust  every  member partner’s inventory increases or decreases results in adjusting all member countries pro rata fees  intermittently.    The  potential  for  constantly  adjusting  TCP  budget  can  have  serious consequences  that  adversely  impact  budgetary  planning,  budget  execution,  and  contract funding.  The frequency of member partner inventory adjustments could promote turmoil in   124  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 TCP communities and pose problems for individual partner members who would be forced to deal with constantly fluctuating pro rata fees throughout the program year. 7.5.16.  Countries  may  request  adjustments  to  inventory  quantities  by  writing  to  the  TCP chief and stating the justification for the adjustment (e.g., destroyed in mishap or transferred to  another  partner).    Information  must  be  included  on  the  disposition  of  the  aircraft  or missiles (e.g., destroyed in mishap or transferred to another partner).   Financial adjustments for  both  inventory  increases  and  reductions  will  be  accomplished  during  the  subsequent program year. 7.5.17.  Nonparticipation  in  TCP.    Eligible  purchasers  who  decide  not  to  take  part  in  the TCP will not receive the following benefits: 7.5.17.1.  Will  not  receive  TO  supplements  and  revisions  that  result  from  TCP  efforts (not shown in the nonparticipant's aircraft/missile configuration). 7.5.17.2.  Will  not  receive  TCTOs  developed  through  the  TCP  for  partner-standard equipment, except to document safety-of-flight hazards. 7.5.17.3.  Will not receive TCP technical data, including ECPs and TCP meeting minutes. 7.5.17.4.  Will not receive TCP technical assistance.  Non-member countries that request technical  assistance  or  support  from  the  TCP  will  be  encouraged  to  join  the  TCP.  However, if the partner does not join the TCP, it will be referred to the SPD for support.  A case may be required  to  provide the requested support which will be fully  funded by the partner. 7.5.17.5.  Are not authorized to receive distribution of updated TOs that result from TCP activities.    Development  of  CSTOs  requires  a  separate  case  line  item.    Release  of  TO updates will be at the discretion of the SPD. 7.5.17.6.  Cannot attend TCP reviews. 7.5.17.7.  Will not receive data for new or improved maintenance practices, or extension of inspection and overhaul intervals developed by the TCP. 7.5.18.  Safety.    The  TCPs  will  inform  all  non-hostile  countries  of  safety-of-flight  hazards.  The TCP chief will ensure that SCOs are included as information addressees on all safety-of-flight  TCTO  messages  for  their  respective  countries.    The  intent  is  to  keep  the  SCOs informed of the status of aircraft, engines and missiles owned by their partners. 7.5.19.  Suspended Countries.  Countries that are suspended (but non-hostile) will normally be provided safety-of-flight information unless direction to the contrary is issued by SAF/IA.  Suspended  countries  may  receive  safety-of-flight  information  only;  they  cannot  receive items, including kits to correct safety problems, or other services.  There will be no contact at all with hostile countries. 7.6.  Leases, Loans, and Temporary Custody of AF Equipment. 7.6.1.  Leases are authorized to countries under the AECA, when it is determined that there are compelling foreign policy and national security reasons for providing such articles on a lease,  rather  than  a  sales  basis,  and  the  articles  are  not  needed  for  USG  use  during  the proposed lease period.  DoD 5105.38-M, Chapter 11, provides guidance for the preparation, AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   125  coordination, and implementation of a lease agreement.  Leases are written and managed by AFSAC International Logistics Branch (AFSAC/IARS). 7.6.2.  FMS Lease Support Cases.  Leases are not FMS transactions and are not entered into the DSCA 1200 System.  A lease will not be provided on an LOA, but a support LOA will be used  for  packing,  crating,  handling,  transportation  (PCH&T),  and  inspection  of  the  articles (for shipment and on return) and associated restocking fee, and sale of associated articles and services, including refurbishment of the defense articles required prior to, during, or after the lease period.  The support LOA will be used to recover applicable costs if an article is lost, damaged, or destroyed during the lease period. 7.6.3.  Lease  Data.    AFSAC  will  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  program  office  and  the cognizant  Air  Staff  agencies  to  determine  availability,  normal  life,  and  acquisition  cost  of articles to  be leased.   Deputy Chief of Staff for  Strategic Plans and Program/Directorate of Programs (AF/A8P) determines availability of aircraft and missiles.  Deputy Chief of Staff/ Logistics, Installations, and Mission Support (AF/A4/7) approves the release of war reserve materiel  (WRM).    AFSAC  determines  the  rental  cost.    Lease  data  and  files  will  be maintained and managed through DSAMS. 7.6.4.  Lease Coordination.  Besides the standard internal coordination, leases must also be coordinated with the following offices: 7.6.4.1.  AF/A4/7  and  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff/Operations,  Plans,  and  Requirements (AF/A3/5) (if any adverse impact on AF readiness is expected). 7.6.4.2.  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force/Acquisition  (SAF/AQ),  AF/A4/7  and AF/A3/5 (if significant combat equipment is included). 7.6.4.3.  Deputy Chief of Staff/ Strategic, Plans and Programs (AF/A8) for all aircraft to be leased. 7.6.5.  Lease  Processing.    The  CM  prepares  the  lease  and  determination  according  to  the format in DoD 5105.38-M.  A "Z" case designator for identification and control is obtained through DSAMS.  If the lease involves INFOSEC, the designator will be established in the "ZO"  series.    Once  the  lease  has  been  signed,  the  CM  will  issue  an  International  Program Directive (IPD) to implement the program.  The implementing agency or DSCA may require a certificate of delivery  when a leased item(s) is  provided to  the lessee.  The implementing agency is responsible for tracking and monitoring the lease to ensure conditions of the lease agreement are followed. 7.6.6.  Lease  Duration.  Leases shall be for a fixed time not to exceed five years and shall provide  that  at  any  time  during  the  leasing  period,  the  USG  may  terminate  the  lease  and require the immediate return of the defense article(s). 7.6.7.  Lease  Amendments  may  be  used  to  renew  or  change  existing  leases.    Changes such as payment schedules, Schedule A items, or revised durations are authorized; however, a Lease Amendment may not be used to add new or additional items to the Schedule A with an effective date different from the effective date of the lease. 7.6.8.  Congressional Notifications.  Section 62(a) of the AECA requires that leases of one year  or  longer  must  be  reported  to  Congress  no  less  than  30  days  before  entering  into  or renewing an agreement.  If a lease for less than one year is renewed (amended), so that the   126  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 total  period  of  the  original  lease  and  the  renewals  equals  or  exceeds  one  year,  the  renewal causing the one year period to be reached or exceeded must be reported to Congress 30 days before  being  entered  into.    However,  the  notification  period  for  North  Atlantic  Treaty Organization  (NATO),  NATO  member  countries,  Australia,  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea,  and New Zealand is no less than 15 days.  Subsequent renewals require a new notification. 7.6.9.  Lease Closure.  AFSAC will notify DFAS-IN/JAX that a lease can be closed.  DFAS will make the final determination whether the lease can be financially closed, and will take appropriate action. 7.6.10.  Loans of Air Force Equipment. 7.6.10.1.  Loans  of  Air  Force  defense  articles  to  any  friendly  partner  or  international organization  may  be  arranged  under  exceptional  circumstances  by  the  authority  of Section 503 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as Amended. 7.6.10.2.  Section  65  of  the  AECA  authorizes  the  loaning  to  NATO  member  countries and  countries  allied  with  NATO  of  materiel,  supplies,  or  equipment  for  the  purpose  of carrying  out  a  program  of  cooperative  research,  development,  testing,  and  evaluation.  The acceptance of an LOA or a gift by NATO countries or countries allied with NATO is also authorized for such purposes. 7.7.  Section 30 Sales. 7.7.1.  Section  30  of  the  AECA,  permits  the  sale  of  government  manufactured  defense articles, government furnished equipment (GFE), government furnished materiel (GFM), and related defense services to US companies under certain conditions. 7.7.2.  LORs for Section 30 Sales.  The US company should send the LOR to AFSAC/CC.  AFSAC/XP will forward the request to AFMC, Contract Law Division (AFMCLO/JAN) for a legal  opinion on whether the proposed sale is  eligible under Section 30 of the AECA.   If approved,  AFSAC/XP  will  assign  a  twoplace  US  company  code  (numeric  plus  alpha)  and assign  a  regional  division  to  handle  the  sale.    The  CM  will  assign  a  pseudo-case  identifier using the US company code and case designator.  No entries will be made in the DSCA 1200 System. 7.7.2.1.  The CM will ensure that the LOR is in accordance with Section 30 of the AECA and DoD 5105.38-M before further processing, which includes submitting a copy of the export license, if required.  If there are competing foreign requests, the CM will obtain a DSCA decision on allocation of assets. 7.7.3.  LOAD  for  Section  30  Sales.    The  CM  will  request  LOAD  as  is  done  normally  for FMS.  LOAD requests must ask for information on AF appropriation to be reimbursed and for breakout of cost elements. 7.7.4.  Sales  Agreements.    The  CM  prepares  and  processes  sales  arrangements.    The  CM will include in the sales agreement only one cost, which will include administrative charges; PCH&T charges (FMS accessorial rates for PCH&T); and other applicable costs. 7.7.4.1.  If accepted, the CM will implement with an IPD and will perform the following functions: AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   127  7.7.4.1.1.  Ensure  that  the  check  received  from  the  US  company  is  sent  to  the implementing command's accountable AF Budget Office for processing. 7.7.4.1.2.  Ensure  that,  if  more  than  one  command  or  agency  is  involved  in implementation, the check is sent to the appropriate AF Budget Office for deposit and for processing of proper vouchers to each command or agency.  The IPD should show the  proportionate  share  of  the  administrative  charge  and  how  these  charges  will  be allocated to each command or agency. 7.7.4.2.  Any  changes  to  the  sales  agreement,  such  as  financial  delivery  performance, must be reported to the CM. 7.7.5.  Section  30  Sales  for  Selective  Availability  Anti-Spoofing  Security  Modules (SAASM).  SAASM security devices can be sold through direct  commercial sale (DCS) to NATO countries and Australia under limited conditions. 7.8.  SCO Personnel Selection and Training. 7.8.1.  A  Security  Cooperation  Organization  (SCO)  is  located  in  a  foreign  partner  country and  performs  assigned  responsibilities  related  to  the  execution  of  security  assistance management functions under Section 515 of the FAA.  The personnel selected to staff these organizations must meet the criteria described herein. 7.8.2.  Selection  Procedures.    SCO  assignment  qualification  criteria,  selection  procedures, and selection approval authority are listed in DoDI 5132.13, Staffing of Security Cooperation Organizations  (SCOs)  and  the  Selection  and  Training  of  Security  Cooperation  Personnel, and  AFI  36-2110,  Assignments.    SAF/IA  will  review  and  approve  all  AF  personnel nominated  for  all  key  SCO  billets  and  will  perform  all  military  service  responsibilities  in accordance  with  DoDD  2055.3,  Manning  of  Security  Assistance  Organizations  and  the Selection and USDP Training of Security Assistance Personnel.  After a member is placed on assignment,  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force/International  Affairs,  International Airmen Division (SAF/IAPA), will assist Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) in scheduling pre-departure briefings and consultations. 7.8.3.  Pre-Departure  Training  for  Security  Assistance  Duties.  Once approved, selected personnel  will  be  scheduled  for  appropriate  language  training,  management  training,  pilot qualification, and other training, as required.  All AF personnel assigned to an SCO billet will attend  orientation  training  in  Washington,  DC  prior  to  their  PCS.    The  SCO  Tailored Training  Approach  Handbook,  published  by  the  Defense  Institute  of  Security  Assistance Management (DISAM), shall be used as a guide in scheduling preparatory training. 7.8.3.1.  Training  at  DISAM  and  orientation  at  DSCA  may  be  waived  only  by  the Director,  DSCA.    Other  training  and  orientation  may  be  waived  only  by  the  unified command or the providing military service with concurrence of the unified command. 7.8.3.2.  Travel and per diem costs associated with pre-departure training will be paid by AF  appropriations  in  accordance  with  AFI  65-601,  Volume  1,  Budget  Guidance  and Procedures  and  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program.    Orientation  training  and briefings  at  unified  commands  and  Washington,  DC  will  be  charged  to  the  appropriate security assistance funds.  DISAM will fund those training courses.    128  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 7.9.  Worldwide Warehouse Redistribution Services Program (WWRS). 7.9.1.  The  USAF  provides,  through  WWRS,  a  materiel  listing  and  transfer  service  for materiel  held  by  partners  and  international  partners  to  fill  other  FMS  or USG  requirements consistent  with  US  law.    This  function  is  provided  under  Section  21  of  the  AECA,  which provides for the sale of defense services, and subsection (m), which allows for the return of non-significant  military  equipment  (non-SME)  categorized  defense  articles.    Non-SME  (as defined in  the AECA) transfers under WWRS rules  do not  constitute a third-party transfer; rather,  the  transfer  process  outlined  in  subsection  (m)  is  used,  and  consists  of  two  separate two-party transfers. 7.9.2.  Partner  Participation.    All  partners  are  automatically  considered  participants  as buyers in the WWRS program.  If AFSAC is not advised, any eligible FMS requisition could be filled by the WWRS.  Purchasers of WWRS materiel utilize their existing Army, Navy, or AF  FMS  blanket  order  requisition  cases  to  order  WWRS-listed  materiel.    The  WWRS program  interfaces  with  the  Cooperative  Logistics  Supply  Support  Arrangement  (CLSSA), the Parts Repair and Ordering System (PROS), and the AF FMS Retention programs in order to select the best method of support for the partner.  Partners can decline using the WWRS program as a method of supply by advising AFSAC. 7.9.3.  Seller  Participation.    In  order  to  participate  as  a  materiel  seller,  the  partner  must establish  an  LOA  for  WWRS  services  with  AFSAC  or  the  Naval  Inventory  Control  Point (NAVICP). 7.9.3.1.  Seller’s WWRS case.  WWRS cases are prepared by AFSAC (for redistribution of  AF  or  Army  FMS-acquired  materiel)  or  NAVICP  (for  redistribution  of  Navy  FMS materiel).  The WWRS LOA is written as a blanket-order value-controlled services case.  The LOA contains special financial terms and arrangements for the automatic transfer of funds from the partner’s WWRS trust fund to the WWRS LOA.  A WWRS line may be added to a new or existing case, provided the case designator type-allows for addition of a services line. 7.9.3.2.  Financial guidance.  The WWRS redistribution services fee is paid by the selling partner.  Selling countries are responsible for the WWRS fee and inbound transportation costs.    Sales  proceeds  are  deposited  in  the  selling  partner  (6Q)  account  at  Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Indianapolis Center, Security Cooperation Accounting (DFAS-IN/JAX).  Buying countries are responsible for cost of the materiel and CONUS transportation cost. 7.9.4.  WWRS  Program  Office  Manpower.    WWRS  Program  Office  Manpower  requests are  documented  IAW  standard  SAMRS  MRP  submission  procedure,  validated  by  the  local manpower office, coordinated and approved through the AFSAC Business Operations Office (AFSAC/XPO), and approved by SAF/IAPX. 7.9.4.1.  WWRS  manpower  will  be  justified  based  on  the  work  center’s  historical workload and will be adjusted based on increasing or decreasing workload. 7.9.4.2.  WWRS  manpower  requirements  will  be  funded  with  the  fee  charged  to  the registered  sellers  in  the  WWRS  Program  on  all  parts  sold  to  FMS  partners  through WWRS. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   129  7.10.  Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Program. 7.10.1.  The MTCR is an informal international political arrangement designed to control the proliferation of rocket and unmanned air vehicle systems (and their associated equipment and technology) capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction.  It was formed in 1987 and has since been expanded to include 34 member countries.  The regime controls are applicable to  such  rocket  and  unmanned  air  vehicles  as  ballistic  missiles,  space  launch  vehicles, sounding  rockets,  unmanned  air  vehicles,  cruise  missiles,  drones,  and  remotely-piloted vehicles capable of delivering a 500-kilogram (1102-pound) payload at least 300 kilometers (186 miles). 7.10.2.  General MTCR Information. 7.10.2.1.  Although the regime is voluntary on the part of each signatory partner, various countries, including the US, have passed laws restricting the export of MTCR-controlled items  (see  AECA  --  22  U.S.C.    43-71(b)  (2)).    In  this  regard,  both  the  DoS  and  the Department  of  Commerce  (DoC)  have  a  role  in  regulating  the  export  of  MTCR-controlled items.  The DoD assists these agencies by identifying MTCR-controlled items that  foreign  partners  have  requested  to  purchase  through  FMS.    As  part  of  the  MTCR LOA  review  process,  LOAs  will  be  reviewed  for  potential  MTCR-controlled  items during development and prior to the coordination for MILDEP signature. 7.10.2.2.  The  DoD,  through  DSCA,  is  responsible  for  reviewing  LOAs  for  possible MTCR-controlled  items.    These  established  review  procedures  serve  to  expedite  LOA processing times, while ensuring compliance with MTCR legislation. 7.10.3.  MTCR LOA Review Process.  A review of LOAs for MTCR-controlled items will be  conducted  during  the  pre-LOA  work-up.    A  confirmation  that  reviews  took  place  is accomplished during final coordination of the LOA for MILDEP signature. 7.10.3.1.  MTCR Reviews.  For LORs received at case-writing activities, (i.e.  AFSAC or AFSAT) that require processing of LOAD requests to sources of supply, follow guidance starting  at  paragraph  7.10.3.1.1.    In  the  case  of  requests  for  Global  Positioning  System (GPS) items,  the LORs  from  partners should include completed GPS MTCR Checklists (see Attachment 16; the latest version of the checklist can be obtained from the AFSAC ―D‖ case process owner).  For LORs which will result in blanket order lines assigned to AFSAC or blanket order training cases assigned to AFSAT and not tasked out for LOAD, follow guidance starting at paragraph 7.10.3.1.7.  For LORs which will result in defined order  lines  assigned  to  AFSAC  that  will  have  orders  filled  via  the  PROS,  see  guidance starting in paragraph 7.10.3.1.8. 7.10.3.1.1.  The  program  office,  program  manager,  or  equivalent-level  office  shall perform a technical review of each LOAD request, as early in the LOA development process  as practical.   This  review will identify any possible MTCR-controlled items contained in the LOAD request or envisioned to be part of the associated program.  In order  to  ensure  a  standard  quality  technical  review,  MTCR  reviews  must  be accomplished  either  by  personnel  who  have  completed  the  DSCA-approved  Missile Technology  Proliferation  Course,  or  who  have  equivalent  experience  in  the  area  of the MTCR and ballistic missile proliferation.  The AF MTCR POC at AFSAC/XPO is required  to  maintain  a  roster  of  personnel  qualified  to  perform  MTCR  reviews  and   130  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 shall  forward  an  updated  roster  to  SAF/IAPX  within  30  days  after  personnel  have completed MTCR training. 7.10.3.1.2.  There is to be documentation in DSAMS ―case remarks‖ of determination whether LOAD contains possible MTCR items (YES or NO). 7.10.3.1.2.1.  DSAMS  ―case  remarks‖  should  indicate  line  number,  full  Military Articles  and  Services  List  (MASL)  line,  line  description,  and  name  of  certified MTCR  reviewer.    If  there  are  subsequent  line  changes,  accomplish  new  ―case remarks‖ with reference by date to the prior ―case remarks‖ entry. 7.10.3.1.3.  For  ―YES‖  determinations,  the  program  manager  is  to  ensure  that  an assessment  with  a  list  of  possible  MTCR  items  is  sent  in  e-mail  format  to AFSAC/XPO where the list is either verified by the AF MTCR POC or returned for re-work. 7.10.3.1.4.  The MTCR assessment is to include the following elements: 7.10.3.1.4.1.  Complete case identifier. 7.10.3.1.4.2.  A general case description, identifying major associated systems. 7.10.3.1.4.3.  MASL number of the item(s) (if known). 7.10.3.1.4.4.  Nomenclature and quantity of each item. 7.10.3.1.4.5.  Full and detailed description of each item,  to  include manufacturer (if known). 7.10.3.1.4.6.  Reason articles are identified as potential MTCR-controlled items. 7.10.3.1.4.7.  Purchasing/end-user partner. 7.10.3.1.5.  Assessments  verified  by  the  AF  MTCR  POC  are  passed  to  the  DSCA MTCR POC who either approves and forwards to the DoS or returns for re-work.  In passing  to  the  DSCA  MTCR  POC,  the  AF  MTCR  POC  courtesy  copies  the  CM, CCM, and SAF/IAPX. 7.10.3.1.5.1.  The  DoS  either  approves  or  disapproves  the  transfer  and  provides notice to  DSCA and other appropriate parties involved via e-mail.  Disapproved items cannot be included on an LOA. 7.10.3.1.6.  The  LOA  transmittal  document  to  DSCA  must  have  an  entry  in  the MTCR ―YES or NO‖ section.   If  yes, then the date that the MTCR assessment was sent  to  DSCA  is  to  be  indicated  and  a  copy  of  the  assessment  is  to  be  attached.  Defense  Security  Cooperation  Agency,  Operations  Directorate,  Case  Writing Division (DSCA/OPS/CWD) checks and confirms the MTCR information. 7.10.3.1.7.  For blanket order case lines or blanket order training cases where items to be ordered are not known upfront, the MTCR entry in DSAMS case remarks is to be ―NO.‖    If  blanket  order  requisitions  are  later  stopped  by  system  edits  for  possible controlled  or  sensitive  items,  the  AF  MTCR  POC  is  to  confirm  that  the  item  is authorized on an end item LOA before approving requisition release.  Otherwise, the requisition  needs  to  be  cancelled  and  submitted  on  a  defined  order  case  with  an MTCR review to be performed. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   131  7.10.3.1.8.  For  defined  order  items  to  be  ordered  via  PROS,  the  CM  is  to  consult with  the  AF  MTCR  POC  regarding  YES  or  NO  determinations  in  DSAMS  case remarks.  The AF MTCR POC then will pass it to an appropriate MTCR reviewer for an assessment. 7.10.3.1.9.  For training that covers the operation, maintenance, installation, or repair of MTCR defense articles, the MTCR entry in DSAMS case remarks is to be ―YES‖ if such training conveys information required for the development, production, or use of the MTCR item. 7.11.  FMS Tactics Manual Program. 7.11.1.  Air Combat Command, Directorate of  Air and Space Operations, Flight  Operations Division,  Security  Assistance  Branch  (ACC/A3TS)  is  the  Line  Manager  for  FMS  tactics manuals.    The  preferred  line  structure  covers  3  updates.    The  correct  MASL  is  J8A 768ABOOKSPUBS.    The  manuals  are  updated  approximately  every  two  years;  however, these updates are dependent on the cycle for updating the USAF manuals.  As updates could be as much as three years apart, the line period of performance should be open ended.  A full set  consists of Basic Employment Manual,  Mission Planning Manual (classified SECRET), and  Advanced  Employment  Manual  (classified  SECRET).    The  manuals  do  not  require ordering.    They  will  automatically  be  updated  as  required.    Delivery  will  be  to  the  Air Attaché at the partner’s embassy in Washington, D.C. 7.11.2.  SAF/IAPD is the overall OPR for this program.  As such, they will approve all new participants.  FMS manuals are USAF derivative manuals and as such will not include tactics for  equipment  not  previously  operationally  tested  and  currently  operated  by  the  USAF.  SAF/IAPD must approve inclusion of materiel not covered in the USAF version before any commitments are made to the partner.  For example, this would include additive munitions or adapting materiel from another platform. 7.11.3.  Tactics  manuals  should  be  considered  if  they  are  applicable  for  any  new  weapon sale.  If so, the recommended timing is that the initial set be available prior to system flight training. 7.11.4.  SAF/IAPD will review all cases/lines for tactics manuals. 7.12.  Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2006, as Amended. 7.12.1.  Section 1206 of the FY2006 NDAA, (P.L.  109-163), as amended, provides authority to  build  the  capacity  of  foreign  military  forces  to  conduct  time  sensitive  counter-terrorist operations or participate in stability operations in which US forces are a participant. 7.12.2.  Procedure  instructions  and  guidance  for  preparing  pseudo  LOAs  is  published annually  by  DSCA  which  provides  the  authority  (e.g.,  Public  Law)  and  funding appropriations (e.g., O&M).  Current Section 1206 procedures are identified below: 7.12.2.1.  A  unique  case  code  (e.g.,  ―G7‖)  is  assigned  annually  by  the  DSCA  to  track funds  provided  under  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act,  Section  1206.    DSCA must  authorize  use  of  this  code  for  pseudo  LOA  documents.    Other  procedures  for creating pseudo LOAs are identified below:   132  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 7.12.2.1.1.

FMS  Management  Plan  (FMSMP).    The  FMSMP  shows  the  milestones  and  events  of  a system sale on a time scale.  The plan gives dates and actions required of the United State Air Force (USAF), the contractor, and the purchaser to start a system acquisition program.  The plan is applied to individual programs.  Milestones must be adjusted to show the specific conditions of  each  program.    This  plan  applies  to  all  agencies  taking  part  in  the  programming,  materiel acquisition,  integrated  logistics  support,  technical  order  planning,  and  training  support  of  the system program.  The information in this attachment is an implementation management tool; it is a  summary  and  serves  as  a  guide  for  developing  specific  plans.      The  Security  Assistance Program  Manager  (SAPM)  is  responsible  for  the  drafting  of  the  FMSMP.      If  a  SAPM  is  not assigned, the responsibility falls to the Case Manager (CM).   Note:  A Life Cycle Management Plan  (LCMP)  prescribed  by  AFI  63-101,  Acquisition  and  Sustainment  Life  Cycle  Management can serve as the FMSMP when tailored to the life cycle of the associated FMS case. A2.2.  FMSMP  Milestones.    Following  the  acceptance  of  a  Letter  of  Offer  and  Acceptance (LOA), the USAF starts developing a detailed plan that will be given to the partner for review at Milestone 4.  After that, the plan serves as the principal management document.  Exchanges of Price  and  Availability  (P&A)  data  may  take  place  before  the  Letter  of  Request  (LOR)  is received.  This preliminary pricing does not obligate the partner to go further with the proposed purchase, nor does it obligate the USAF to issue an LOA.  It does provide the chance to evaluate a system in general order of magnitude, pricing, and production lead-times. A2.2.1.  Milestone 1--Letter of Request. A2.2.2.  Milestone  2LOA  Presentation.    If  appropriate,  the  LOA  presentation  is  made  to provide  the  LOA  and  to  explain  the  pricing,  schedules,  and  overall  program.    If  in-country presentation  is  required,  an  LOA  presentation  team,  normally  consisting  of  Deputy  Under Secretary  of  the  Air  Force/International  Affairs  (SAF/IA)  Country  Director,  Air  Force Security  Assistance  Center  (AFSAC),  SAPM,  Air  Force  Security  Assistance  Training (AFSAT) Squadron, survey personnel (when required), and a contractor representative will: A2.2.2.1.  Review  foreign  military  sales  (FMS)  procedures,  applicable  to  the  system, including follow-on support. A2.2.2.2.  Explain the logistics and training support plan. A2.2.2.3.  Review the financial management procedures. A2.2.2.4.  Reaffirm  the  system  configuration,  operations  concept,  maintenance  concept, and basic factors used to prepare the LOA. A2.2.2.5.  Outline the procedures for time-phased delivery of operations and maintenance (O&M) support equipment and spare parts, intermediate maintenance support equipment and spare parts, and depot support equipment and spare parts. A2.2.2.6.  Explain  the  international  engine  management  program  (IEMP),  technical coordination program (TCP), etc., as appropriate. A2.2.2.7.  Review the FMS management plan outline. AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011   173  A2.2.2.8.  Explain the acquisition procedures for long lead items. A2.2.3.  Milestone 3Acceptance (Before Expiration Date of Offer).  This is for signature and return  of  the  LOA  to  the  issuing  office  and  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service, Indianapolis Center, Security Cooperation Accounting (DFAS-IN/JAX) receipt of the initial deposit. A2.2.4.  Milestone 4Implementation.  The CM prepares and issues the International Program Directive  (IPD).    The  Post  Acceptance  Review  includes  review  and  completion  of  the FMSMP,  arrangement  of  dates  for  all  definitization  conferences  (e.g.,  configuration, provisioning, training), and review of the IPD. A2.2.5.  Milestone  5  Cooperative  Logistics  Supply  Support  Arrangement  (CLSSA) Established.    The  CLSSA  should  be  accepted  not  later  than  17  months  before  the  first modified end-item delivery.  Delay of this milestone means a slippage in follow-on support availability.  Other follow-on support cases must be accepted prior to the delivery of the first major end-items. A2.2.6.  Milestone 6Periodic security assistance program reviews. A2.2.7.  Milestone 7Preactivation Readiness Review (Host: partner or Security Cooperation Officer  (SCO)).    The  same  agencies  involved  in  program  reviews  will  attend  the Preactivation Readiness Review, with technician substitutions necessary to complete survey requirements.  The purposes of the review include: A2.2.7.1.  Evaluate  the  status  of  all  items  being  procured  to  make  sure  that  they  are  in place before the system activation date A2.2.7.2.  Identify and correct problems that affect initial operating capability A2.2.7.3.  Conduct  a  survey  of  the  status  of  the  base  and  facilities,  support  equipment, spares, munitions, training aids, technical data, personnel, and planning in the country. A2.2.7.4.  Conduct  the  mobile  training  team  (MTT)  survey  before  deployment  of instructor pilots and maintenance MTT. A2.2.7.5.  Review the mode of transportation and the delivery schedule for the system. A2.2.8.  Milestone  8First  Aircraft  Production.    This  milestone  identifies  the  first  end-item's completion date and establishes when the delivery phase starts. A2.2.9.  Milestone 9First System Delivery InCountry.  This milestone identifies the date the first major end items arrive in country. A2.2.10.  Milestone  10FollowOn  Review.    System  reviews  are  sometimes  required  after initial  activation.    The  need  for  such  meetings  depends  on  partner  experience  with  the system, changing production considerations, support availability, and other factors. A2.2.11.  Milestone 11--Case Closure.   174  AFMAN16-101  15 FEBRUARY 2011 Figure A2.1.

There are 2 military, 2 organic, and 2 contractor positions providing engineering, program management, contracting, financial, logistics and test management services for this program which will be sharing 50% with XX-D-XXX thru the period of performance of FY 10/4.   Several factors have played a role in the extension of this manpower as cited in amendment 2 of this case.   A substantial delay in the schedule of the modification for the aircraft has caused: (1) the renegotiation of the modification schedule by the prime contractor; (2) increased costs to the program; and (3) a delay in the initiation and follow-on support of the aforementioned aircraft.
