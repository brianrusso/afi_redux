Post III) Pages: 58  This Air Force Instruction (AFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-8, Defense Support  of  Civil  Authorities  (DSCA);  Department  of  Defense  Directive  (DODD)  3025.18, Defense  Support  of  Civil  Authorities  (DSCA);  Department  of  Defense  Instruction  (DODI) 3025.20, Defense Support of Special Events; DODI 3025.22, The Use of the National Guard for Defense  Support  of  Civil  Authorities;  DODI  1322.28,  Realistic  Military  Training  (RMT)  Off Federal Real Property, DODI 3025.21, Defense Support of Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies; and  DODI  3025.16,  Defense  Emergency  Preparedness  Liaison  Officer  (EPLO)  Programs.    It aligns  the  Air  Force  (AF)  with  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive  5  (HSPD-5), Management  of  Domestic  Incidents;  Presidential  Policy  Directive  8  (PPD-8),  National Preparedness;  the  National  Incident  Management  System  (NIMS);  and  information  on  the National  Planning  Frameworks  to  include:  the  National  Prevention  Framework,  National Mitigation  Framework,  National  Response  Framework  (NRF)  and  the  National  Disaster Recovery  Framework.  This  instruction  defines  the  AF  DSCA  mission  as  a  cross-functional mission integrating equipment and resources with procedures and standards for disaster response planning  and  disaster  response  operations,  and  provides  guidance  and  procedures  concerning support for Federal, State and local civilian law enforcement agencies.  This publication applies to  all  AF  personnel  on  active  duty,  to  include  those  Reserve  Component  (RC)  (AF  Reserve (AFR)  and  Air  National  Guard  (ANG))  personnel  when  federalized  or  in  a  federal  status,  i.e. “active  duty”  IAW  Title  10  United  States  Code  (U.S.C.)  §  101  in  support  of  (ISO)  DSCA missions.  State ANG units should familiarize themselves with this publication in order to have a clear understanding of the AF DSCA response process in the event they are federalized.  When complying with official policy, guidance, and/or procedures, a unit may request a waiver.  The 2 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 fundamental  aim  of  a  waiver  must  be  to  enhance  mission  effectiveness,  while  preserving resources  and  safeguarding  health  and  welfare.    When  a  commander  approves  a  waiver,  the commander is communicating to subordinates and superiors that he/she accepts the risk created by non-compliance.  Each requirement mandated for compliance at the Wing level found within this AFI is tiered, signifying the appropriate waiver authority for the requirement.  Requests for waivers  must  be  submitted  through  the  chain  of  command  to  the  appropriate  Tier  waiver approval  authority for consideration and approval.   The Tier waiver approval  level  is  indicated within  the  text  of  this  AFI  as  T-0,  T-1,  T-2  or  T-3.    See  AFI  33-360,  Publications  and  Forms Management, for Tier waiver authority. Send  major  command  (MAJCOM)  supplements  to  HQ  USAF/A3OB,  1480  Pentagon,  Rm 1E730,  Washington,  D.C.  20330  for  coordination  and  approval  before  publication.    Refer recommended  changes  and  questions  to  the  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  using  the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command for approval by AF/A33.  Ensure that all records  created  as  a  result  of  processes  prescribed  in  this  publication  are  maintained  IAW  AF Manual  (AFMAN)  33-363,  Management  of  Records,  and  disposed  of  IAW  the  AF  Records Disposition  Schedule  (RDS)  located  in  the  AF  Records  Information  Management  System (AFRIMS). SUMMARY OF CHANGES This AFI has incorporated significant changes and must be reviewed completely.  This revision establishes new guidance and instructions from DODD 3025.18, DODI 1322.28, DODI 3025.20, DODI  3025.21,  and  DODI  3025.22.    It  merges  these  new  authorities  within  the  AF  response process.    It  addresses  the  Request  for  Assistance  (RFA)  process,  DSCA  response  phases, command  and  control  (C2),  force  presentation,  and  execution.    It  provides  an  overview  of Federal  and  State  military  roles  within  each  Geographic  Combatant  Command  (GCC)  Area  of Responsibility (AOR) tasked with  DSCA planning and operations.   It  also  incorporates lessons learned  from  Hurricanes  Gustav,  Hanna,  Ike,  Irene  and  Super  Storm  Sandy.    Additionally,  it identifies  tier  waiver  authorities  per  AFI  33-360  for  wing  or  equivalent,  and  below,  Direct Reporting Unit (DRU), Field Operating Agency (FOA) compliance items.

Overview.  This AFI provides guidance for the execution and oversight of AF DSCA when requested by civil authorities or qualifying entities and approved by the appropriate Department of Defense (DOD) official, or as directed by the President, within the U.S., including the District of  Columbia,  the  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico,  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands,  Guam,  American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and any territory or possession of the U.S.  DSCA capabilities are derived from AF warfighting capabilities that could be utilized to  aid  in  the  response  to  disasters,  declared  emergencies  and  to  support  designated  law enforcement activities, as well as other authorized activities.  DSCA is  not support provided in response  to  foreign  disasters  (e.g.,  foreign  consequence  management  or  foreign  humanitarian assistance/disaster response). 1.2.  Purpose.  This AFI provides higher headquarters staffs, installations and unit commanders with  the  guidance,  structure,  roles  and  responsibilities  to  execute  DSCA  planning,  response operations  and  support  to  designated  agencies  when  requested  by  civil  authorities  and  other qualifying entities and approved by appropriate DOD officials, or as directed by the President. 1.3.  Concept.  DSCA is support initiated by a RFA to DOD from civil authorities or qualifying entities  or  is  authorized  by  the  President  or  Secretary  of  Defense  (SecDef).    DSCA  is  support provided by Federal military forces, DOD civilians, DOD contract personnel, DOD component assets,  and  National  Guard  (NG)  forces  (when  the  SecDef,  in  coordination  with  (ICW)  the governors  of  the  affected  States,  elect  and  request  to  use  those  forces  in  Title  32  U.S.C.,  NG status  or  when  Federalized).    The  SecDef  validates  and  approves  whether  DOD  assistance  is provided.  The Joint Staff (JS), upon SecDef approval for DOD assistance, coordinates with the Services  for  a  sourcing  solution.    AF  assets  may  be  sourced  to  provide  assistance  based  on capabilities.  AF  assistance  may  not  be  provided  if  such  assistance  would  adversely  affect national security or military readiness. DSCA operations are divided into three broad categories domestic emergencies, designated law enforcement support, and other activities and may overlap or be in effect simultaneous, depending upon the event.  Figure 1.1. depicts categories, types of DSCA missions, and examples. 1.3.1.  Domestic  Emergencies.    The  AF  provides  support  to  a  primary  agency  or  the  lead federal agency (LFA) as a result of natural or manmade disasters or Presidential emergency or major disaster declaration IAW the NRF.  The NRF is a guide to how the Nation conducts all-hazards response.  It is built upon scalable, flexible, and adaptable coordinating structures to  align  key  roles  and  responsibilities  across  the  Nation,  focusing  particularly  on  how  the Federal Government is organized to support communities and States in a catastrophic event.  Civil  authorities  may  request  DOD  assistance  under  the  Robert  T.  Stafford  Disaster  Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (referred to as Stafford Act), as amended (42 U.S.C. § 5121, et seq.), the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. § 1535), mutual aid memoranda, or under  Immediate Response Authority (IRA).    1.3.1.1.  Complex  Catastrophe.    Joint  Publication  3-28,  Defense  Support  of  Civil Authorities denotes that a complex catastrophe is  defined as “Any natural or man-made incident  including  cyberspace  attack,  power  grid  failure  and  terrorism,  which  results  in 6 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 cascading  failures  of  multiple,  interdependent,  critical,  life-sustaining  infrastructure sectors and causes extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage or disruption severely affecting the population, environment, economy, public health, national morale, response efforts,  and/or  government  functions.”    The  AF  must  be  ready  to  respond  to  a  complex catastrophe utilizing the Total Force construct. 1.3.1.2.  Stafford  Act  (42  U.S.C.  §  5121  -  §  5207).    This  act  is  designed  to  provide  a means  by  which  the  Federal  Government  may  assist  State  and  local  resources  in  major disasters  or  emergencies  where  those  State  and  local  resources  have  been  or  will  be overwhelmed.  The governor or chief executive of the affected State, territories, etc., or tribal authorities  may request the declaration of  major disaster or emergency and must demonstrate, as a prerequisite for receiving assistance that the State’s response plans have been  activated,  and  that  State  and  local  entities  require  assistance  for  an  effective response.    Once  the  President  issues  a  federal  disaster  declaration,  the  affected  area becomes eligible for Federal assistance. 1.3.1.3.  Economy  Act.    The  Economy  Act  of  1932,  as  amended  (31  U.S.C.  §  1535) authorizes the DOD to provide direct support to other Federal agencies on a reimbursable basis.  The Economy Act does not authorize the provision of any direct support to State or local entities. 1.3.1.4.  Immediate  Response  Authority  (IRA).    DODD  3025.18  authorizes  DOD officials  to  use  IRA  when  a  RFA  is  made  by  civil  authority  under  imminently  serious conditions  and  when  time  does  not  permit  approval  from  higher  headquarters.  Commanders  and  other  responsible  officials  in  authority  over  AF  organizations  provide immediate response by temporarily employing the resources under their control, subject to  any  supplemental  direction  provided  by  higher  headquarters,  to  save  lives,  prevent human  suffering  or  mitigate  great  property  damage  within  the  U.S.    DOD  Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) may not be used for Federal, State, or local immediate response per SecDef Policy Memorandum 15-002, “Guidance for the Domestic Use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems” dated 17 FEB 2015, at Attachment 2.  Immediate response is situation-specific  and  may  or  may  not  be  associated  with  a  declared  or  undeclared  disaster,  civil emergency,  incident,  or  attack.    Military  commanders  and  others  in  authority  over  AF organizations  acting  under  IRA  shall  not  use  military  force  to  quell  civil  disturbances unless  specifically  authorized  by  the  President  IAW  the  Insurrection  Act  of  1807  (10 U.S.C. § 331-335) or permitted under emergency authority (EA) as outlined in paragraph 3.3  and  authorized  IAW  DODD  3025.18.    See  paragraph  3.2.  for  further  guidance regarding IRA. 1.3.2.  Designated Law Enforcement Support.  The Posse Comitatus Act (PCA) of 1878 (18 U.S.C. § 1385) prohibits the direct active participation of Title 10 U.S.C. § 101, active duty military  forces  to  execute  civilian  laws  unless  otherwise  authorized  by  The  Constitution  or Congress.    The  PCA  does  not  apply  to  ANG  forces  in  State  Active  Duty  (SAD)  status  or Title 32 U.S.C. status.  Subject to the limitations of the PCA and to the extent authorized, the AF may provide assistance in restoring public health, services and civil order. 1.3.3.  Other Activities.  The President or Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  may  designate  a  major  event  that  is  considered  to  be  nationally  significant  as  a National Special Security Event (NSSE).  Events of lesser significance may be rated by the AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 7 Special Events Working Group (SEWG) with a Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) 1-5.  These events may still require AF support similar to NSSEs.  Regardless of the event, the RFA process is used to request AF assets and capabilities to support the LFA. 1.3.3.1.  Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR).  This rating system was developed by the  SEWG,  with  participation  of  over  thirty  Federal  agencies.    SEAR  methodology creates a single system for evaluating events for situational awareness and consideration of  additional  support.    This  SEAR  methodology  has  been  adopted  by  DHS  and  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for evaluating Special Events. 1.3.3.2.  Each  event  will  be  evaluated  and  assigned  a  SEAR  level  by  the  SEWG (reference  paragraphs 1.3.3.2.1. through 1.3.3.2.5.). 1.3.3.2.1.  SEAR  Level  1.    A  level  1  event  is  of  significant  national  and/or international importance that may require extensive Federal interagency security and incident management preparedness. 1.3.3.2.2.  SEAR Level 2.  A level 2 event is a significant event with national and/or international  importance  that  may  require  direct  national-level  Federal  support  and situational awareness. 1.3.3.2.3.  SEAR Level 3.  A level 3 event is an event of national and/or international importance  that  requires  only  limited  direct  Federal  support  to  augment  local capabilities. 1.3.3.2.4.  SEAR  Level  4.    A  level  4  event  is  an  event  with  limited  national importance that is generally handled at the State and local levels. 1.3.3.2.5.  SEAR  Level  5.    A  level  5  event  is  an  event  that  may  be  nationally recognized but generally have local or State importance. 1.3.4.  AF  forces  may  be  provided  to  the  Combatant  Commander  (CCDR)  for  directed exercises designed to improve force readiness to accomplish DSCA related operations. 1.4.  Program Guidance.  The following sections describe DSCA program guidance: 1.4.1.  The  AF  will  establish  an  integrated  DSCA  response  process  to  provide  assistance  to civil  authorities  consistent  with  the  NRF  and  the  NIMS.    In  addition  to  the  NRF,  AF personnel  should  be  familiar  with  the  other  National  Planning  Frameworks;  i.e.,  National Prevention,  National  Mitigation,  National  Disaster  Recovery  and  the  National  Protection Frameworks (when published) as noted in this AFI.   1.4.1.1.  The  National  Prevention  Framework  describes  what  the  whole  community—from  community  members  to  senior  leaders  in  government—should  do  upon  the discovery of intelligence or information regarding an imminent threat to the homeland in order to thwart an initial or follow-on terrorist attack. This Framework helps achieve the National Preparedness Goal of a secure and resilient Nation that is optimally prepared to prevent an imminent terrorist attack within the U.S. 1.4.1.2.  The National  Mitigation Framework  establishes a common platform and forum for  coordinating  and  addressing  how  the  Nation  manages  risk  through  mitigation capabilities.  It  describes  mitigation  roles  across  the  whole  community.  This  Framework addresses  how  the  Nation  will  develop,  employ,  and  coordinate  mitigation  core 8 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 capabilities  to  reduce  loss  of  life  and  property  by  lessening  the  impact  of  disasters. Building  on  a  wealth  of  objective  and  evidence-based  knowledge  and  community experience,  this  Framework  seeks  to  increase  risk  awareness  and  leverage  mitigation products, services, and assets across the whole community. 1.4.1.3.  The  National  Disaster  Recovery  Framework  is  a  guide  to  promote  effective recovery, particularly for those incidents  that are  large-scale or  catastrophic.  It  provides guidance  that  enables  effective  recovery  support  to  disaster-impacted  states,  tribes,  and local jurisdictions. It provides a flexible structure that enables disaster recovery managers to operate in a unified and collaborative manner. It also  focuses on how best to restore, redevelop, and  revitalize the health, social,  economic, natural,  and environmental  fabric of the community and build a more resilient Nation. 1.4.2.  Civil authority RFAs are provided to the office of the Executive Secretary of the DOD (ExecSec),  as  depicted  in  Figure  3.1.,  Request  for  Assistance  Process,  and  shall  include  a commitment to reimburse IAW the Stafford Act or the Economy Act.  Requests for support for immediate response (see paragraph 3.2.) and mutual aid should be IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Programming, Planning, and Operations; AFI 25-201, Intra-Service, Intra-Agency, and Inter-Agency Support Agreement Procedures; and AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services (FES) Program. 1.4.3.  Any  AF  support  to  civilian  law  enforcement  officials  must  be  consistent  with  the needs  of  national  security  and  military  readiness,  while  recognizing  and  conforming  to  the legal  prohibitions against  direct  DOD involvement  in  civilian law enforcement activities as provided for in the PCA.  Guidance pertaining to defense support of civilian law enforcement agencies is addressed in paragraph 3.5. 1.4.4.  Civil authorities shall be informed that oral requests for IRA in an emergency must be followed by a written request  at  the earliest opportunity that includes an offer to  reimburse the DOD.  Support may be provided on a non-reimbursable basis only if required by law or if both authorized by law and approved by the appropriate DOD official.   Assistance will not be  delayed  or  denied  based  on  the  inability  or  unwillingness  of  the  requester  to  make  a reimbursement commitment. 1.4.5.  All  civil  authority  RFAs  shall  be  evaluated  using  CARRLL  [Cost  (including  the source of funding and budgetary impacts), Appropriateness (whether providing the response is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  AF),  Risk  (safety  of  AF  personnel),  Readiness  (impact  on performance  of  a  unit’s  primary  mission),  Legality  (compliance  with  laws),  and  Lethality (potential use of lethal force by or against AF forces)]. 1.4.6.  The  SecDef  IAW  DODD  5111.13,  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Homeland Defense  and  Global  Security  (ASD(HD&GS)),  serves  as  the  approval  authority  for  RFAs from  civil  authorities  or  qualifying  entities  except  for  assistance  when  responding  to  civil disturbances and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) events; assistance to civilian  law  enforcement  organizations  and  responding  with  assets  with  the  potential  for lethality. The SecDef remains the approval authority for the exceptions listed above. 1.4.7.  DOD  UAS  in  the  United  States  may  only  be  used  for  HD,  DSCA,  and  NG  State support  operations,  including  operations  to  support  Federal,  State,  local,  and  tribal government  organizations,  if  approved  by  SecDef,  see  Attachment  2,  Deputy  Secretary  of AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 9 Defense Policy Memorandum 15-002, Guidance for the Domestic Use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (17 Feb 2015).   Use of armed UAS/RPA for DSCA operations is not authorized. Figure 1.1.  Examples of DSCA Operational Categories and Operational Types.  10 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 2 DSCA ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Domestic Emergencies. 3.1.1.  The AF responds to a wide variety of emergencies to include major accidents; natural disasters; hazardous material spills; and CBRN incidents.  When directed by the SecDef, or otherwise authorized, the AF will support civil authorities. 3.1.2.  Types of Response. instruction  authorize 3.1.2.1.  Immediate  Response. commanders  the  use  of  IRA  when  requested  by  civil  authority.    With  the  exception  of UAS,  a  commander  may  apply  resources  to  support  civilian  authorities  under  IRA consistent with paragraph 3.2. and reporting requirements.   DODD  3025.18  and this 3.1.2.2.  Mutual  Aid  Agreements.    Installation  commanders  may  establish  mutual  aid agreements with the local community including, but not limited to, firefighting, medical evacuation and/or other areas as authorized IAW AFI 10-2501 and AFI 32-2001. 3.1.2.3.  10-Day Rule.  AF units may be directed by the President to perform emergency duties on public or private lands essential for the preservation of life or property IAW 42 U.S.C.  §  5170b(c)(1).    These  operations  may  occur  prior  to,  but  in  anticipation  of,  a Presidential  declaration  of  a  major  disaster  or  emergency.    AF  involvement  under  this provision  may  ONLY  be  carried  out  for  a  period  not  to  exceed  10  days,  absent  other authority. 3.1.2.4.  Presidential  Declaration.    RFAs  during  Presidentially-declared  disasters  and other civil emergencies originate from the affected State governor to the President.  Once the  President  declares  the  affected  area  a  disaster,  it  becomes  eligible  for  Federal assistance IAW the Stafford Act. 3.1.2.4.1.  DHS,  through  FEMA,  coordinates  all  Federal  response  as  the  LFA  IAW the  NRF.    The  coordination  of  relief  efforts  of  all  Federal  agencies  in  both  major disasters  and  emergencies  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Federal  Coordinating  Officer (FCO).    The  FCO  validates  all  requests,  determines  which  Federal  departments  or agencies  are  best  able  to  respond  to  a  particular  need,  request,  or  requirement,  and tasks the respective department or agency. 3.1.2.4.2.  Commanders shall respond to all Federal taskings within his/her capability withholding only those resources required to conduct their wartime mission, maintain force  protection  requirements,  and  otherwise  avoid  impairment  of  their  ability  to maintain military effectiveness. 3.1.2.4.3.  If  an  installation  commander  receives  a  RFA  directly  from  local authorities, the request shall be redirected to the local/State EM authorities unless an IRA condition exists or an existing mutual assistance agreement is applicable.  (T-0) 3.2.  Immediate Response Authority (IRA). AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 25 3.2.1.  Commanders and others in  authority over AF organizations, in  response to  a request from a civil authority, are authorized to respond during imminently-serious conditions under IRA to enable temporary employment of resources under their control to save lives, prevent human  suffering,  or  mitigate  great  property  damage  where  time  does  not  permit  obtaining approval from higher authority.  Commanders may use IRA to assist in the SAR, evacuation, and emergency medical treatment of casualties, the maintenance or restoration of emergency medical capabilities, and the safeguarding of public health.  Commanders may assist with the emergency  restoration  of  essential  public  services  and  utilities.    This  may  include firefighting, water, communications, transportation, power, and fuel.  They may also consider providing  immediate  assistance  to  assist  public  officials  in  emergency  clearance  of  debris, rubble,  and  explosive  ordnance  from  public  facilities  and  other  areas  to  permit  rescue  or movement  of  people  and  restoration  of  essential  services.    This  list  is  not  exhaustive.  However,  commanders  must  recognize  that  this  is  not  a  blanket  provision  to  provide assistance.    Such  requests  are  time-sensitive  and    shall  be  received  from  local  government officials within 24 hours following completion of a damage assessment.   Commanders will always consider the impact that providing immediate response would have on their military mission  requirements  and  not  jeopardize  them.    IRA  does  not  permit  actions  that  would subject civilians to the use of military authority that is regulatory, prescriptive, proscriptive, or compulsory IAW DODD 3025.18. (T-0) 3.2.1.1.  Per DepSecDef Policy Memorandum 15-002, Guidance for the Domestic Use of Unmanned  Aircraft  Systems  (17  Feb  2015),  DOD  UAS  may  not  be  used  for  Federal, State,  or  local  immediate  response.    DOD  UAS  may  be  used  for  Search  and  Rescue (SAR) if approved at the appropriate level (Attachment 2). 3.2.2.  Civil authorities shall be informed that oral requests for assistance must be followed as soon  as  possible  by  a  written  request  that  includes  an  offer  to  reimburse  the  AF;  however, assistance  will  not  be  delayed  or  denied  based  on  the  inability  or  unwillingness  of  the requester to make a reimbursement commitment. 3.2.3.  Commanders  and  others  in  authority  over  AF  organizations,  directing  a  response under IRA shall immediately notify the NJOIC, through the chain of command, of the details of the response.  The NJOIC will inform appropriate DOD Components, including the GCC as described in AFI 10-206 and DODD 3025.18.  (T-0) 3.2.4.  An immediate response shall end when the necessity giving rise to the response is no longer  present  (e.g.,  when  there  are  sufficient  resources  available  from  State,  local,  and/or other  Federal  agencies  to  respond  adequately  and  that  agency  or  department  has  initiated response  activities)  or  when  directed  by  a  higher  authority.    The  DOD  official  directing  a response under IRA shall reassess whether there remains a necessity for the DOD to respond under this authority as soon as practicable but, if immediate response activities have not yet ended, not later than 72 hours after the RFA was received.  (T-0) 3.2.5.  Commanders and others in authority over AF organizations directing an IRA response shall  continually  assess  whether  the  transpiring  emergency  requires  a  continued  AF involvement which should be limited to the minimum demanded by necessity and terminated as soon as practical.  (T-0) 3.3.  Emergency Authority (EA). 26 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 3.3.1.  Military  forces  in  Title  10  U.S.C.  status  shall  not  be  used  to  quell  civil  disturbances unless specifically authorized by the President IAW the Insurrection Act of 1807 (10 U.S.C. § 331-335) or permitted under EA, as described below.  In these circumstances, Commanders have  the  authority,  in  extraordinary  emergency  circumstances  where  prior  authorization  by the  President  is  impossible  and  duly-constituted  local  authorities  are  unable  to  control  the situation,  to  engage  temporarily  in  activities  that  are  necessary  to  quell  large-scale, unexpected civil disturbances because (IAW DODD 3025.18): 3.3.1.1.  Such  activities  are  necessary  to  prevent  significant  loss  of  life  or  wanton destruction  of  property  and  are  necessary  to  restore  governmental  function  and  public order; or, 3.3.1.2.  When duly constituted Federal, State, or local authorities are unable or decline to provide  adequate  protection  for  Federal  property  or  Federal  governmental  functions.  Federal action, including the use of Federal military forces, is authorized when necessary to protect the Federal property or functions. 3.4.  Request for Assistance (RFA) Process. 3.4.1.  RFA Submission.  Incidents are managed at the lowest level possible. DOD support is provided  in  response  to  requests  from  civil  authorities  (e.g.,  Federal  agencies  or  State governors,  etc.,)  for  DOD  capabilities  to  support  their  emergency  response  efforts  using  a formal RFA process.  How DOD handles RFAs depends on various factors, such as: Stafford Act or non-Stafford Act situation, urgency of the incident, establishment of a JFO, if a DCO or  JTF  has  been  appointed,  and/or  the  originator  of  the  request  (e.g.,  incident  command, State, regional, or national level agency).   3.4.2.  RFA  Validation.    In  general,  the  RFA  process  is  conducted  as  shown  in  Figure  3.1. Request  For  Assistance  Process.    The  FCO  at  the  incident  site  receives  RFAs  from  civil authorities (e.g., State Coordinating Officer (SCO) or other official) and submits them to the DOD ExecSec, who forwards them to the ASD(HD&GS) and to the JS/J3 for validation and order processing, respectively.  When a DCO is at the incident site, RFAs are routed through the DCO and submitted directly to ASD(HD&GS).  Once the SecDef approves the request, an  order  is  issued  to  CCMDs,  Services,  and/or  agencies  to  accomplish  the  mission.    The decision  process  differs  significantly  for  approving  Stafford  and  non-Stafford  RFAs  (see Figure 3-2  Request  For  Assistance Process Decision  Matrix).  Requests are validated at  all levels within the chain of command.  JS/J3 prepares an order and coordinates with necessary force  providers,  legal  counsel,  and  ASD(HDI&DSCA)  to  ensure  asset  de-confliction  and recommendation concurrence.  DOD officials at all levels evaluate all requests by U.S. civil authorities  for  military  assistance  against  following  six  established  criteria  known  as CARRLL as prescribed IAW DODD 3025.18 and previously referenced in paragraph 1.4.5. of this AFI. AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 27 Figure 3.1.  Request for Assistance Process.  28 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 Figure 3.2.  Request for Assistance Process Decision Matrix. 3.4.3.  DCO  and  DCE  Actions.    The  DCO  is  supported  by  DCE,  an  administrative  and support  staff  consisting  of  five  permanently  assigned  personnel.    A  DCO  and  DCE  are assigned to the FEMA regional office may function as part of the RRCC or the JFO (when established).    Upon  receipt  of  the  RFA,  the  DCO  evaluates  the  request  to  determine  if  it meets DOD’s screening criteria using CARRLL. 3.4.3.1.  The DCO will validate and ensure the RFA is readily understandable and clearly describes  the  requirement  and  necessary  support.    Agencies  will  not  make  requests  for specific capabilities, as they may not be available within DOD at the time and a similar  AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 29 capability may be able to satisfactorily provide the requested support.   If the RFA does request a specific capability, the DCO, with the support of the DCE, will coordinate with the  requesting  agency  and  recommend  appropriate  language  to  fulfill  the  request  on  a timely basis.  If the DCO determines the RFA does not meet the evaluation criteria or is unable to support the request, the DCO returns the RFA to the requesting agency with an explanation as to why it is not being supported. 3.4.3.2.  After  the  DCO  validates  the  RFA,  a  copy  of  the  RFA  is  forwarded  to  the supported headquarters’ operations center along with a recommendation for action if the requested  support  has  been  previously  approved,  or,  to  be  forwarded  to  the  JS/J3  and ASD(HD&GS)  for  further  validation/assessment  and  approval/disapproval.   This recommendation  is  also  provided  to  the  FCO  who  will  ultimately  decide  if  the  request must be forwarded to the RRCC and NRCC, as required. 3.4.3.3.  The  DCO  and  DCE  will  coordinate  with  the  NG  JFHQ-State  or  JTF-State headquarters  element  and  Federal  military  operational  headquarters  (JTF,  contingency support  group,  operational  command  post,  JFC,  etc.),  supporting  the  response  effort  to determine  if  non-Federalized  and  Federal  military  forces  already  deployed  are  capable and available to provide the assistance requested.  The requested support  will be within the scope of the original mission Statement, as well as cost allocations.  3.4.4.  JS/J3  Actions.    Normally  JS/J3  upon  receipt  of  the  RFA  will  coordinate  it  with  the supported CCMD, supporting CCMDs, Military Departments and applicable combat support agencies.    Once  coordination  is  complete,  JS/J3  sends  the  RFA  to  ASD(HD&GS)  where  it undergoes  a  final  review  and,  if  recommended,  the  action  is  coordinated  with  the  NGB  to ensure  that  there  is  no  duplication  of  effort  between  NG  and  the  Active  Component  (AC).  The ASD(HD&GS) then passes the RFA to the SecDef for decision.  Upon SecDef approval, J3  tasks  the  Services  to  source.    If  forces  are  available  the  Services  may  be  directed  to immediately provide the requested support.   3.4.4.1.  Stafford Act requests, in some circumstances, may originate from the State EOC, FEMA RRCC, or the FEMA NRCC and pass directly to the JS/J3 or the DOD ExecSec, rather than routing though a DCO.  These RFAs are processed the same as non-Stafford Act  requests,  with  JS/J3  and the  operational  headquarters  conducting  parallel coordination and providing a recommendation to ASD(HDI&DSCA) and the SecDef for approval or disapproval.  In all cases, the supported CCDR and the affected DCO must be notified to limit redundant coordination of resources. 3.4.4.2.  Upon SecDef approval, the JS/J3 releases an EXORD to designate supported and supporting  CCDRs,  and  to  task  force  providers  to  provide  the  necessary  support.    The response measures taken by DOD will be to fulfill unmet demands of the incident, IAW current laws, Presidential directives, executive orders, and DOD policies, directives, and orders. 3.4.5.  Operational  Headquarters.    USNORTHCOM  and/or  USPACOM,  as  the  operational headquarters for DSCA missions will provide a supporting operation order, implementing a concept plan (CONPLAN), if available, and establish command relationships to provide task, purpose, and coordinating instructions to the supporting force. 30 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 3.4.5.1.  Since  DSCA  missions  may  involve  lifesaving  responses,  this  process  will  be rapidly  executed  to  expedite  the  prompt  movement  of  forces  and  support.  DOD  cannot provide  support  without  SecDef  approval  of  an  official  request  from  State  or  Federal agency or direction from the President, or unless specifically authorized in existing policy or regulation.  If a disaster is of such proportions to generate mass casualties in need of evacuation,  DOD  supports  the  primary  agency  for  this  function  under  the  National Disaster  Medical  System  (NDMS)  (once  the  NDMS  has  been  activated  and  an  official request for patient evacuation has been submitted by proper State authorities). responsible 3.4.5.2.  The  CCDRs for  DSCA  are  CDRUSNORTHCOM  and CDRUSPACOM.  Each incorporates plans for DSCA by task organizing their commands to accomplish these missions as well as other assigned missions.  DOD is a signatory to numerous  response  plans  as  well  as  various  memoranda  of  understanding  and memoranda of agreement with other agencies; therefore, DOD may play a critical role in CS and may be relied upon by many agencies. 3.5.  Defense Support of Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies. 3.5.1.  Posse Comitatus Act (PCA).  The fundamental restriction on the use of the military in civilian law enforcement activities is the PCA.  It provides that, unless expressly authorized by  the  Constitution  or  an  act  of  Congress,  whoever  willfully  uses  any  part  of  the  Armed Services as a posse comitatus or to otherwise execute civil law shall be fined, imprisoned or both.  See DODI 3025.21 for specific PCA restrictions and exceptions. 3.5.2.  The  SecDef  or  his/her  delegated  authority  is  the  approval  authority  for  RFAs  for support  of  civilian  law  enforcement  agencies  except  for  IRA  and  EA  as  discussed  in paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3., and IAW DODD 3025.18. 3.5.3.  Relevant Information.  Subject to certain limitations and procedural steps, the AF may provide to Federal, State or local civilian law enforcement officials any information obtained during  the  normal  course  of  military  operations  that  appears  to  be  materially  relevant  to  a violation  of  any  Federal  or  State  law  within  the  jurisdiction  of  such  officials  IAW  DODI 3025.21,  AFI  14-104,  Oversight  of  Intelligence  Activities;  AFI  33-324,  The  Air  Force Information  Collections  and  Reports  Management  Program;  AFI  71-101V1,  Criminal Investigation  Program;  and  AFI  71-101V4,  Counterintelligence.    Refer  to  these  references for specific guidance.   3.5.3.1.  AF  officials  at  all  levels  are  to  ensure  the  needs  of  civilian  law  enforcement officials for information are taken into account in the planning and execution of training, exercises  and  operations  IAW  DODI  3025.21  and  DODI  1322.28.    All  planning  and training efforts shall be coordinated with the applicable DSCA CCDRs and their service components. 3.5.4.  Civil Disturbance Operations. 3.5.4.1.  Civil disturbances are acts of violence by groups causing disorder prejudicial to public  law  and  order  within  the  50  States,  District  of  Columbia,  Commonwealth  of Puerto  Rico,  U.S.  possessions  and  territories,  or  any  political  subdivision  thereof.  Included  in  this  category  are  riots,  acts  of  violence,  insurrections,  and  unlawful obstructions or assemblages. The President is authorized by the Constitution and laws of the United States to employ the Armed Forces to suppress insurrections, rebellions, and AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 31 domestic  violence  under  various  conditions  and  circumstances.    The  employment  of Federal  military  forces  to  control  civil  disturbances  shall  only  occur  in  a  specified  civil jurisdiction  under  specific  circumstances  as  authorized  by  the  President.  Normally,  this authorization  is  through  issuance  of  an  Executive  order  or  other  Presidential  directive authorizing  and  directing  the  Secretary  of  Defense  to  provide  for  the  restoration  of  law and  order  in  accordance  with  Title  10  U.S.C.  §  331-334  in  a  specific  State  or  locality. Commanders  have  Emergency  Authority  in  extraordinary  circumstances  where  prior authorization  by  the  President  is  impossible.  See  paragraph  3.3.  for  further  guidance. Responsibility for the management of the Federal response to civil disturbances rests with the Attorney General.  3.5.4.2.  Any  employment  of  forces  ISO  law  enforcement  operations  shall  maintain  the primacy  of  civilian  authority.    The  Attorney  General  is  responsible  for  receiving  State requests for Federal military assistance, coordinating such requests with the SecDef and other  appropriate  Federal  officials,  and  presenting  such  requests  to  the  President,  who will determine what Federal action, will be taken.  Refer to AFI 31-118, Security Forces Standards  and  Procedures,  for  guidance  concerning  the  use  of  deputized  State  or  local law  enforcement  powers  by  DOD  uniformed  law  enforcement  personnel;  and  AFI  31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, for guidance on the use of force.  3.5.4.3.  Military members shall not impose or assume authority of any function of civil government  unless  absolutely  necessary  under  emergency  conditions  as  discussed previously  in  paragraphs  3.3.  and  3.5.4.  above.    Any  commander  who  is  directed,  or undertakes,  to  control  such  functions  shall  strictly  limit  military  actions  to  emergency circumstances and shall facilitate the reestablishment of civil responsibility at the earliest time possible.  (T-0) 3.5.5.  Domestic  Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal  (EOD)  Support  of  Civil  Law  Enforcement Agencies.    See  AFI  32-3001,  Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal  (EOD)  Program,  for  specific guidance.    The  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  retains  “cradle  to  grave”  responsibility  for military  munitions  regardless  of  the  location.    Military  commanders  will  provide  EOD support for military munitions per DoDI 3025.21, and 40 CFR 300.120.   (T-0) 3.5.5.1.  AF officials, including local military commanders, may provide EOD support to local  civilian  authorities  under  IRA  situations.    This  support  may  include  actions providing  advice  and  assistance  to  civil  authorities,  when  requested,  in  the  mitigation, rendering safe, and disposal of hazardous military explosive items and other improvised explosive  devices  that  pose  an  immediate  threat  to  life  or  property.    EOD  forces providing  support  under  IRA  will  comply  with  applicable  local,  State  and  Federal  laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations. 3.5.5.2.  Rendering  safe  and  disposing  of  improvised  explosive  devices,  non-military commercial  explosives  or  similar  dangerous  articles  reported  or  discovered  outside  of DOD  installations  are  primarily  the  responsibility  of  civil  authorities.    However,  due  to the potential lethality and danger to public safety, EOD personnel may provide assistance upon request. 3.5.5.3.  Requests  from  civil  authorities  for  non-immediate  EOD  support  unrelated  to materials  that  are of, or  appear to  be of,  DOD origin  will be subject  to approval  by the SecDef,  or  his/her  designated  representative.    Examples  of  non-immediate  DOD  EOD 32 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 support  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  post-blast  analysis,  use  of  DOD  materials  and equipment,  and  support  of  pre-planned  events.    Route  requests  to  the  DOD  ExecSec using the RFA process as outlined in Figure 3.1. 3.5.6.  Military  Working  Dog  detector-dog  support  may  be  provided  to  support  civil authorities in emergency and non-emergency situations.  See AFI 31-121, Military Working Dog Program, for specific guidance.  RFAs for these assets are submitted by the requestor to the DOD ExecSec using the RFA process as outlined in Figure 3.1.  3.6.  Use of Military Equipment and Facilities.  In circumstances not immediately threatening to  human  life,  human  suffering,  or  great  property  damage,  requests  for  equipment  and  base facilities  may  be  made  available  to  Federal,  State  or  local  civilian  officials  to  include  law enforcement IAW AFI 23-119, Exchange, Sale, or Temporary Custody of Non-Excess Personal Property; and AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property. 3.7.  Resources.  Planning and execution are subject to priorities established by the President or the  SecDef.    Each  RFA  for  AF  resources  will  be  evaluated  at  all  levels  of  command  IAW paragraphs 1.4.5. and 3.4 of this AFI and DODD 3025.18.  DSCA planning and execution will adhere to the following guidelines: 3.7.1.  A  basic  premise  of  the  NRF  is  that  incidents  are  generally  handled  at  the  lowest jurisdictional  level  possible.    In  the  vast  majority  of  incidents,  local  resources  will  provide the first line of emergency response and incident management support. 3.7.1.1.  The  NG  may  be  the  first  military  force  to  respond  to  support  first  responders when local  capabilities are  exhausted, and the incident response is  elevated to  the State level.  In this capacity, the NG will be in SAD or Title 32 U.S.C. status.  As an integrated and  supporting  organization  of  a  State’s  EM  response,  the  NG  supports  the  incident commander (IC) IAW the NIMS. 3.7.1.2.  Should  the  State’s  resources  become  exhausted,  the  governor  of  the  affected (supported) State may request interstate mutual aid through the Emergency Management Assistance  Compact  (EMAC)  system.    EMAC  is  a  collaborative  arrangement  among member States that provide a legal framework for requesting resources from each other.  Supporting States will provide requested resources/assets if available.  Resources include the supporting State’s ARNG and ANG  assets provided  ISO the supported State.  State NG  assets  will  remain  under  the  control  of  the  supporting  State’s  governor  unless otherwise authorized.  (T-0) 3.7.2.  AF  resources  will  be  provided  only  pursuant  to  IRA  or  when  civilian  response resources have been or will be overwhelmed and tasked as a result of an approved Stafford or Economy Act RFA. (T-0) 3.7.3.  Military  forces  in  Title  10  U.S.C.  status  employed  in  DSCA  activities  shall  remain under  Federal  military  C2  at  all  times.    This  requirement  may  be  satisfied  by  a  designated dual-status  commander  (see  Chapter  4)  who  is  recognized  by  both  Federal  and  State command  lines.    Within  a  JTF,  AF  elements  will  normally  be  presented  to  the  supported CCDR  as  a  task-oriented,  tailored  organization  called  an  AETF,  under  the  command  of  a COMAFFOR.    The  COMAFFOR  advises  the  CCDR  or  JFC  on  the  best  employment  of aerospace  power  and  ensures  specialized  AF  capabilities  (e.g.,  airlift,  foreign  language  as appropriate and airborne/space-based reconnaissance) are used efficiently. AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 33 3.7.4.  If  mobilization  of  Reserve  Component  forces  is  required  and  authorized,  follow guidance  published  in  AFI  10-402,  Mobilization  Planning,  AFI  10-403,  Deployment Planning  and  Execution,  and  AF  Handout  (AFH)  10-416,  Personnel  Readiness  and Mobilization. 3.8.  Reporting.  DSCA responsible CCDRs  will establish joint  reporting requirements through their  service  components.  Examples  of the  type  of  reports  that  may  be  required  are  noted:    for situational awareness, situation reports (SITREPs), for personnel accountability, Joint Personnel Status  (JPERSTATS)  reports,  for  Logistics  Status  (LOGSTAT),  for  Medical  Readiness (MEDRED)  reports  and  others  as  directed.    Additionally,  the  AF  Service  Component  to  each DSCA  CCDR  will  ensure  AF  specific  reports  such  as  personnel  force  accountability  (See  AFI 36-3802,  Personnel  Readiness  Operations)  or  AFI  36-3002,  Casualty  Reporting,  etc.,  are accomplished during DSCA operations.     3.8.1.  DOD  official  directing  a  response  under  IRA  shall  immediately  notify  the  NJOIC, through  the  chain  of  command,  of  the  details  of  the  response.    The  NJOIC  will  inform appropriate  DOD  Components,  including  the  GCC.    Reporting  requirements  for  all  DSCA events are IAW AFI 10-206. See also para. 3.5.3. 3.9.  Funding and Reimbursement. 3.9.1.  Unless waived by proper SecDef authority IAW DODD 3025.18 and DODI 3025.21, reimbursement  is  required  when  equipment  or  services  are  provided  to  agencies  outside DOD.  All requests for AF resources, except IRA, must be validated by the LFA in order to be reimbursed for DSCA operations ISO Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. § 5121-5207) and Economy Act (31 U.S.C. § 1535) RFAs. 3.9.1.1.  Stafford  Act  or  Economy  Act  approved  RFAs  will  be  coordinated  with  AF/A3 and  AF  Financial  Management  (FM)  with  the  appropriate  DSCA  CCMD’s  financial branch  for  the  issuance  of  a  Project  Code  and/or  establishment  of  an  Emergency  and Special Program Code for reimbursement and identified in either a FRAGO or EXORD. 3.9.2.  IRA  support  is  provided  on  a  cost-reimbursable  basis.    However,  do  not  withhold providing support for circumstances in which the requestor is unable or unwilling to commit to reimbursement. 3.9.3.  Document reimbursable expenses and submit through comptroller channels IAW AFI 65-601V1,  Budget  Guidance  and  Procedures,  SAF/FMF  AFAFO  Reimbursement Accounting Guidance and Standard Operating Procedures, and DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 11, Chapter  1,  within  30  calendar  days  after  the  month  in  which  performance  occurred  or  as directed by higher headquarters guidance.  3.10.  DSCA Response Phases. 3.10.1.  DSCA operations are  generally conducted in  six phases:  shape, anticipate, respond, operate,  stabilize,  and  transition  (Figure  3.3.).    During  planning,  the  JFC  establishes conditions,  objectives,  or  events  for  transitioning  from  one  phase  to  another.    Phases  are designed  to  be  conducted  sequentially,  but  some  activities  from  a  phase  may  begin  in  a previous phase and continue into subsequent phases.  A DSCA operation may be conducted in multiple phases simultaneously if the JOA has widely varying conditions.  The following phases conform to JP 3-0, Joint Operations, and JP 5-0, Joint Operation Planning, phasing 34 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 planning  guidance  and  are  modified  as  necessary  to  describe  the  specific  requirements  of DSCA. 3.10.2.  Phase  0  -  Shape.    Phase  0  is  continuous  situational  awareness  and  preparedness.  Actions  in  this  phase  include  interagency  coordination,  planning,  identification  of  gaps, training/exercises  programs,  and  public  affairs  outreach.    These  activities  continue  through all  phases  and  consist  of  normal  or  routine  military  activities,  establishing  or  solidifying relationships  with  interagency partners, friends,  and allies while expanding interoperability, and cooperation through these partnerships. 3.10.3.  Phase  I  –  Anticipate.    Phase  I  begins  with  the  identification  of  a  potential  DSCA mission,  a  no-notice  event,  or  when  directed  by  the  President  or  SecDef.    The  phase  ends with  assigned  response  forces  deployed  or  when  the  determination  is  made  that  there  is  no event  requiring  DSCA  response.    Phase  I  success  is  achieved  when  deployment  of  a  DCO, EPLO,  and  other  selected  response  forces  is  accomplished.    These  forces  are  postured  to facilitate  quick  response  after  coordination  with  the  primary  agency,  the  FCO/JFO  and coordination with State, local, and tribal officials. 3.10.4.  Phase  II  -  Respond.    Phase  II  begins  with  the  deployment  of  initial  response capabilities.    The  phase  ends  when  response  forces  are  ready  to  conduct  operations  in  the JOA.    Phase  II  success  is  achieved  when  forces  are  deployed  with  sufficient  capability  to support civil  authorities in  accomplishment  of the mission.  DSCA operations are based on RFAs  that  could  be  made  at  different  times,  and  for  missions  that  could  be  completed  at different times.  Consequently, forces will likely deploy into and out of the JOA during the entire DSCA operation. 3.10.5.  Phase III  – Operate.  Phase  III begins when DSCA response operations commence.  Phase  III  ends  when  Title  10  forces  begin  to  complete  mission  assignments  and  no  further RFAs  are  anticipated  from  civil  authorities.    Phase  III  success  is  achieved  when  currently deployed DOD capabilities are sufficient to support civil authorities. 3.10.6.  Phase IV – Stabilize.  Phase IV begins when military and civil authorities decide that DOD support will scale down.  Phase IV ends when DOD support is no longer required by civil authorities and transition criteria are established.  Phase IV success is achieved when all operational aspects of mission assignments are complete. 3.10.7.  Phase  V  -  Transition.    Phase  V  begins  with  the  redeployment  of  remaining  DOD forces.  The phase ends when response forces have been relieved, redeployed, and OPCON is transferred  to  their  respective  commands.    Phase  V  success  is  achieved  when  DOD  forces have transitioned all operations back to civil authorities. AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 35 Figure 3.3.  Six Phases Of A Civil Support Operation.  36 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 4 FORCE PRESENTATION, COMMAND AND CONTROL RELATIONSHIPS, STATE ROLES AND THE DUAL STATUS COMMANDER (DSC) IN DSCA OPERATIONS 4.1.  DSCA RESPONSE FORCE PRESENTATION. 4.1.1.  DOD DSCA response forces are provided by Federal military forces, DOD civilians, DOD contract personnel, DOD component assets, and NG forces when the SecDef, ICW and concurrence of the governors of the affected States, elects and requests to use those forces in Title  32  U.S.C.,  or  when  Federalized  in  response  to  RFAs  from  civil  authorities  and  upon approval  from  appropriate  DOD  authorities,  the  SecDef  or  the  President  for  domestic emergencies,  law  enforcement  support,  and  other  domestic  activities,  or  from  qualifying entities for special events.  See DODD 3025.18 and DODI 3025.21 for more information. 4.1.2.  AF DSCA response forces can be provided by the assets from AF service components from  the  AC  to  include active  duty  AFFORs,  AF  civilians,  AF  contract  personnel  and  RC, which may include AFR and ANG.   In the domestic operating  environment,  overall DSCA success  relies  on  the  ability  of  the  AF  military  commander  to  work  ISO,  and  with,  other government/nongovernment agencies and organizations.  DSCA includes support to prepare, prevent,  protect,  respond,  and  recover  from  domestic  incidents  including  terrorists’  attacks, major disasters both natural and man-made, and designated special events. DSCA is one type of  a  joint  military  operation.  DSCA  describes  the  military  contribution  to  a  whole-of-government response to major or catastrophic disasters.   4.1.3.  Presentation  of Air Expeditionary  Forces (AEFs)  for a DSCA event  is  accomplished through  the  AF  Service  Components  to  the  CCDRs.    AEFs  are  presented  to  the  JFC  in  a single, capabilities-based entity—the AETF.  The AETF is the AF warfighting organization attached to a JFC.  The AETF is organized, equipped and sized with the appropriate type and number  of  forces  for  the  mission  to  be  accomplished.    The  AETF  commander  (i.e., COMAFFOR)  organizes  forces  as  necessary into  Air  Expeditionary  Wings,  Air Expeditionary  Groups,  Air  Expeditionary  Squadrons,  and/or  expeditionary  flights, detachments, or elements to provide reasonable internal spans of control, command elements at  appropriate  levels,  and  to  retain  unit  identity.    A  Numbered  Expeditionary  Air  Force (NEAF)  normally  has  an  appropriate  numerical  designation  based  on  NAFs  historically associated with the region or command (i.e., 1 AETF is associated with 1 AF).  Subordinate expeditionary units may retain their own numerical designations.  The NEAF commander is normally a COMAFFOR (per AF Doctrine Volume  III, Command,  AF  Doctrine Annex 3-27,  Homeland  Operations,  and  AF  Doctrine  Annex  3-30,  Command  and  Control (https://doctrine.af.mil/index.htm). 4.2.  Supported Combatant Commander C2 and the Joint Task Force in DSCA Operations. 4.2.1.  Supported  CCDR.    A  CCMD  is  a  unified  or  specified  command  with  a  broad continuing mission under a single commander established and so designated by the President, through SecDef, and with the advice and assistance of the CJCS.  A commander of a unified command  may  establish  subordinate  unified  commands  to  conduct  operations  on  a continuing  geographic  or  functional  basis.    There  are  three  types  of  joint  forces:  CCMD, subordinate unified command, and JTF. JTFs for domestic operations will normally involve AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 37 supporting Homeland Defense (HD) and Civil Support (CS) or DSCA operations.  DOD may provide support to U.S. civil authorities IAW the NRF via the Stafford Act or Economy Act RFAs and as authorized by the President or SecDef.  Additionally, for DSCA operations the CCDRs  and DOD  forces are  ISO  a Primary or  LFA/Civil Authorities, and as such  ISO the overall civilian effort in a DSCA event. 4.2.1.1.  The  CDRUSNORTHCOM  is  the  supported  CCDR  and  is  responsible  for  Title 10 U.S.C., active duty HD missions and DSCA missions in the continental US, Alaska, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in the AOR.  USNORTHCOM also maintains a standing JTF CS element for other civil support type missions.   4.2.1.2.  CDRUSPACOM  is  the  supported  CCDR  and  is  responsible  for  HD  and  CS  or DSCA missions for Hawaii, Guam, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific region, his AOR. JS/J3  publishes  an  EXORD  to  further  delineate  support  relationships,  available  forces, end state, purpose,  and  SecDef  approved scope  of actions.   It  is  important  to  remember that  the  supported  and  supporting  CCDRs  are  identified  in  the  CJCS  standing  DSCA EXORD.  4.2.2.  Joint  Task  Force  (Federal).    The  supported  CCDR,  either  CDRUSNORTHCOM  or CDRUSPACOM,  will  be  the  JTF  establishing  authority  in  most  DSCA  operations/events; however,  the  SecDef,  a  subordinate  unified  command  commander,  and  a  JTF  commander, also  may  establish  subordinate  JTFs.    A  JTF  is  established  when  the  scope,  complexity,  or other  factors  of  the  contingency  or  crisis  require  capabilities  of  Services  from  at  least  two Military  Departments  operating  under  a  single  JFC.    The  supported  CCDR  may  elect  to designate  a  JTF  and  establish  the  C2  structure  to  command  Federal  (Title  10)  military activities  ISO  the  incident  objectives,  based  on  the  complexity,  type  of  incident,  and  the anticipated  level  of  DOD  resource  involvement.    The  CCDR  may  deploy  a  JTF  to  execute DSCA operations ISO of a primary or coordinating agency in the JOA. 4.2.2.1.  JTF  deployment  is  not  contingent  on  a  RFA  from  a  primary  or  coordinating agency. 4.2.2.2.  A catastrophic event may dictate multiple JTF deployments.  4.2.2.3.  When  a  JTF  is  established,  consistent  with  operational  requirements,  its  C2 element  will  be  collocated  with  the  senior  on-scene  leadership  at  the  JFO  to  ensure coordination and unity of effort.  The collocation of the JTF C2 element does not replace the  requirement  for  a  DCO/DCE  to  be  part  of  the  JFO  unified  coordination  staff.    The DCO remains the DOD single point of contact at the JFO for RFAs to DOD. 4.2.2.4.  Either  a  standing  JTF  or  one  configured  for  specific  missions  provides emergency assistance across all lines of support.  The JTF for DSCA may require greater proportions  of in  a  combat environment/deployment. support  units  and  capabilities than required 4.2.2.5.  The  JTF  will  usually  exercise  OPCON  or  TACON  of  DOD  DSCA  forces attached ISO the Federal effort within the JOA. 4.2.2.6.  All  classes  of  supply  and  all  types  of  services  may  be  required.    Close coordination  between  the  JTF  and  appropriated  Emergency  Support  Function  (ESF) coordinator is required.  Interface for that coordination is through the DCO. 38 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 4.3.  State Civil Authority Roles - Governor, and Local Government. 4.3.1.  Governor  or  Chief  Executive.    A  governor/Chief  Executive  of  a  State,  territory, commonwealth,  or  tribal  entity,  etc.,  as  chief  executive,  is  responsible  for  the  public  safety and  welfare  of  their  respective  residents.    The  governor  coordinates  State  resources  and provides  the  strategic  guidance  for  response  to  all  types  of  incidents.    This  includes supporting  local  governments’  efforts  before,  during  and  after  incidents  as  needed  with  in-State  resources  first.    If  and/or  when  those  resources  may  be  exceeded,  the  governor  may request/coordinate  assistance  with  other  States  under  established  EMAC  agreements.    If those resources are inadequate or unavailable, the governor initiates RFAs IAW the Stafford Act  in  order to obtain  Federal Government  agencies’ support.   For  certain  types of Federal assistance, tribal governments work with the State, but as sovereign entities they can elect to deal directly with the Federal government for other types of assistance.  State officials have the authority to direct a State immediate response.  Use of State NG personnel under State C2 for a State response (including personnel in a Title 32 U.S.C. status) will be IAW State law under the activation and direction/concurrence of the Governor. 4.3.2.  State/Local  Emergency  Management  Agency  (EMA)  Director  and  the  EOC.    The State/local  EMA  Director  has  day-to-day  responsibility  and  authority  for  overseeing State/local  EM  programs  and  activities.    The  EMA  Director  establishes  and/or  directs functions  of  either  the  State  or  local  EOC.    The EOC  is  the  physical  location  where  multi-agency coordination occurs and entails coordinating all aspects of a jurisdiction’s capabilities in preparedness, response and recovery activities/operations.  The EMA Director ensures the EOC is staffed to support the incident command, arranges needed resources and  assesses the availability  and  readiness  of  those  local/State  resources  most  likely  required  during  an incident by identifying and correcting any shortfalls.  The chief elected or appointed official provides policy direction and supports the IC and emergency manager, as needed, to include unified objectives related to incident planning and incident management. 4.3.3.  The  Adjutant  General  (TAG)  –  State.    TAG  advises  the  governor  on  military  affairs and  commands  the  State’s  ARNG  and  ANG  forces  within  that  State.    These  organizations will  likely  be  the  first  military  forces  utilized  in  a  State’s  domestic  emergency  incident response.  Forces are deployed in either a SAD or a Title 32 U.S.C. status; both will remain under  the  control  of  the  governor  through  the  State’s  TAG.    Advantages  associated  in employing State guard assets in SAD or Title 32 status are, most notably, the ability to assist law enforcement as the PCA does not apply to these forces.  DSCA military response must be  a  coordinated  effort  between  State  guard  forces  and  those  Federal  (Title  10  U.S.C.)  or USCG (Title 14 U.S.C.) forces.  TAGs will have a JFHQ-State for pre-incident coordination/ planning  with  Federal  JTFs  or  GCC  staffs.    TAGs  may  establish  JTF-State  to  execute  the State’s  military  forces  incident  management  response  efforts.    Depending  on  the  State  or territory the EMA Director or State’s Homeland Security Advisor may be the same person as TAG of the State’s guard forces.  See Figure 4-1 for TAG Roles by States. AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 39 Figure 4.1.  The Adjutant General (TAG) Roles By States.  4.3.3.1.  Joint  Force  Headquarters-State  (JFHQ-State).    Each  State  has  a  JFHQ-State, which  integrates  the  State’s  ARNG  and  ANG  resources.    The  JFHQ-State  provides  a focal point to operate jointly with CCMDs and any Federal JTFs that may perform HD or CS  missions  within  a  State’s  boundaries.    JFHQ-State  planners  should  also  possess detailed  understanding  of  JOPES,  Adaptive  Planning  and  Execution  (APEX),  CCDR DSCA  plans,  and  the  NRF.    When  a  governor  or  TAG  deploys  State  ARNG  or  ANG forces  ISO  requests  from  civil  authorities  or  to  a  specific  event  or  incident  they  may create a JTF-State. 4.3.3.2.  Joint  Task  Force  –  State  (JTF-State).    The  JTF-State  provides  C2  for  State ARNG/ANG  resources  and  facilitates  the  flow  of  information  between  the  JFHQ-State and the deployed units.  The JTF-State commander must maintain situational awareness 40 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 of local, State, and Federal actions to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of response, support,  and  safety  activities  by  working  closely  with  the  IC.    As  the  State’s  senior ARNG  or  ANG  commander  on  scene,  the  JTF-State  commander  is  responsible  for  the safe,  efficient,  and  legal  employment  of  all  State  military  forces.    The  JTF-State commander  also  has  the  responsibility  to  know  what  capabilities  the  various  State ARNG/ANG units in that State possess and how they might be applied to the incident at hand so that they can be efficiently used to provide the most effective response possible. 4.3.3.2.1.  The  JTF-State  commander  can  request  that  the  JFHQ-State  activate  and deploy additional units, if additional capabilities are required. JTF-State  commander  and 4.3.3.2.2.  The require  a  comprehensive understanding of the regulations and procedures that govern the status of SAD, Title 32, and Title 10 U.S.C. forces.  These statuses establish the actions and constraints for planning and employment of forces, Rules for Use of Force (RUF), and IAA.  staff 4.3.3.2.3.  JTF-State  commander  and  staff  operate  in  close  coordination  with  local, State,  tribal,  and  Federal  agencies  that  will  have  different  statuses  and  RUF. Depending on the operation’s size, augmentation from the NG JFHQ-State staff and State’s ARNG and ANG may be needed.  In some cases, active duty (Title 10 U.S.C.) forces augmentation might be needed. 4.3.3.2.4.  JTF-State  planners  should  be  cognizant  of  USNORTHCOM  and USPACOM  DSCA  and  HD  CONPLANS,  as  well  as  individual  State  plans  and planning systems.   4.3.3.2.5.  The  JTF-State  commander  interacts  with  multiple  outside  elements  in working  to  achieve  unity  of  effort  ISO  domestic  operations.    State  ARNG/ANG forces will remain under the command vested in the governor and TAG of that State, unless the forces and HQ in question have been Federalized under Title 10 U.S.C. 4.3.3.2.6.  The JTF-State commander also may, with the approval of the governor and with the consent of the President (delegated to SecDef), be called into Federal service and continue service under State regulations so that they may command both Federal and State ARNG/ANG forces.  This  is  known  as a DSC, thus  facilitating a unity of effort for all military forces at the incident site. 4.4.  Dual Status Commander (DSC). 4.4.1.  DSC  Establishment.    When  Federal  and  State  military  forces  are  employed simultaneously  ISO  civil  authorities  within  each  State,  the  appointment  of  a  DSC  may  be appropriate.    The  governor  of  a  State  and  the  SecDef  must  mutually  agree  that  such establishment  is  necessary  and  proper  (standing  delegation  of  authority  to  permit  this  dual-status is granted to the SecDef by the President).  This option should improve unity of effort and  ensure  a  rapid  response  to  save  lives,  prevent  human  suffering,  and  mitigate  great property  damage  for  designated  planned  events,  or  in  response  to  an  emergency  or  major disaster within the States.  USNORTHCOM and/or USPACOM staffs, ICW the NGB staff, will  conduct  sufficient  planning,  preparation,  and  coordination  such  that  on  order appointment  and  employment  of  a  DSC  is  an  option  capable  of  immediate  implementation should  the  President  or  SecDef  and  governor  of  the  affected  State(s)  so  agree.    JP  3-28, AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 41 DSCA  notes  that  DSC  construct  will  not  be  applicable  to  civil  disturbance  operations,  HD operations, or to Federal military commanders providing DSCA under IRA. 4.4.2.  DSC  Role.    Under  the  Constitution,  the  President  serves  as  the  commander-in-chief over  the  Federal  armed  forces.    State  governors  command  their  respective  State  ARNG  or ANG forces except when called to Federal service.  Consequently, only the Federal chain of command may command Title 10 U.S.C. forces, and only the State chain of command may command  its  NG  forces  when  serving  in  a  Title  32  U.S.C.  or  SAD  status.    There  are, however,  specific  Federal  statutory  authorities  allowing  for  designated  DSCs  to  serve  in  a hybrid  Federal  and  State  status.  The  DSC  may  not  command  both  the  Federal  and  State military  personnel  simultaneously.    Rather,  this  "dual  status"  authorizes  the  DSC  to command  both  Federal  and  State  forces  in  a  mutually  exclusive  manner.    A  DSC  is established  pursuant  to  Title  32  U.S.C.  §  325  for  ARNG  or  ANG  officers;  or  when  a commissioned officer of the Regular Army or Regular AF is established as a DSC pursuant to Title 32 U.S.C. § 315. Deputy Commanders for each status are used to assist the DSC in each command chain. 4.4.3.  DSC  Nomination  and  Certification.    A  State’s  TAG  may  nominate,  with  the Governor’s  approval,  an  ARNG  or  ANG  Officer  (Federally  recognized  O-6  or  General Officer  and  eligible  for  “authority  to  command”)  as  a  DSC  candidate  to  CNGB  and CDRUSNORTHCOM/  CDRUSPACOM  as  appropriate.    Nominated  DSC  candidates  will complete  CCDR  required  training  for  each  respective  theater  (i.e.,  USNORTHCOM  or USPACOM)  ICW  NGB  required  training  requirements  for  certification.    A  DSC  may  be either an Army (ARNG) or AF (ANG) Officer (Federally recognized O-6 or General Officer eligible  for  “authority  to  command”)  who  becomes  Federalized  and  retains  his  or  her  State status;  or  a  Regular  Army  or  Regular  AF  general  officer  who  receives  a  State  Guard commission  while  retaining  his  or  her  Federal  military  status.    Deputy  Commanders  are established  for  each  command  chain  (State/Federal)  and  will  meet  the  same  DSC  training requirements. DSCs must be identified, trained, and appointed IAW JP 3-28, Appendix C. 4.4.4.  DSC Concept of Operations.  DSCs can be utilized in USNORTHCOM’s DSCA AOR consisting  of  the  forty-eight  contiguous  States,  Alaska,  the  District  of  Columbia,  and  the territories  of  Puerto  Rico  and  the  US  Virgin  Islands.    DSCs  will  be  utilized  in  the USPACOM  AOR  in  Hawaii,  and  Guam.    The  territories  of  American  Samoa,  and  the Northern Marianas Islands do not have National Guard organizations. 4.5.  DSC  Command  Relationships  and  Command  and  Control  (C2)  Construct  (Figure 4  2). 4.5.1.  A  DOD  DSCA  response  may  require  support  to  multiple JOAs.    This  is  particularly true  in  a  large  scale  or  complex  catastrophe  response.    See  Figure  4.2.,  Command Relationships  and Command and Control (C2) Construct  and Force Presentation  for DSCA Operations  with  Federal/State  DSC  JOAs,  for  this  and  subsequent  paragraphs  below.    The figure  represents  anticipated  command  relationships  and  C2  constructs  in  such  an  instance.  Also,  the  Figure  portrays  the  USNORTHCOM  command  relationships  that  may  vary  with USPACOM’s command relationships, however, this is for illustrative purposes indicating the complexities of DSCA operations.   42 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 4.5.1.1.  The illustration shows two JOAs, a Federal JOA under an established and named JTF-Federal  Disaster  (JOA  1)  providing  Direct  Support  (green  line)  to  the  FEMA Region. 4.5.1.2.  The second JOA is denoted under the established DSC and named Dual Status Commander  JTF  (State  JOA  2)  who  will  command  both  Federal  and  State  military forces through the Deputy Title 10 and Title 32 commanders as appropriate. 4.5.2.  IAW the NRF, FEMA will establish a Joint Field Office (JFO) comprised of Federal and State agencies to allocate forces and assign missions.  The FCOs and SCOs will also be in  the  JFO  for  coordination  with  the  DOD  representative.    CDRUSNORTHCOM,  the supported  CCDR,  is  responsible  for  DOD  DSCA  and  supports  response  operations  in  the designated JOA through approved MAs from  the primary agency exercising OPCON  of all Federal  military  forces.    CCDR  representation  in  the  JFO  is  provided  by  the  DCO  who functions  as  the  DOD  single  point  of  contact  for  Federal  military  support  to  the  operation.   The  DCO,  with  the  DCE,  are  assigned  under  the  OPCON  of  ARNORTH.    AF  EPLOs (OPCON to CDRAFNORTH) supports the DCO/DCE at the JFO and the State’s EOC.  The DCO coordinates with the SCO and FCO and validates the MAs as to the appropriateness for DOD support/involvement.    incidents  are  normally 4.5.3.  Since  DSCA the USNORTHCOM  AOR  the  CCDR  designates  to  the  Army  Service  component  (i.e., ARNORTH)  as  the  Joint  Force  Land  Component  Commander  (JFLCC),  OPCON  of  the subordinate  Federal  JTF  (i.e.,  JTF-Federal  Disaster  in  JOA  1)  IAW  USNORTHCOM’s DSCA  CONPLAN  3500,  ANNEX  J,  Command  Relationships.    This  JTF  is  in  Direct Support  of  the  Primary  Agency  (i.e.,  FEMA  Region).    The  other  functional  components provide Direct Support to the JFLCC as indicated by the green line. land  centric  events, in  which 4.5.4.  When the MAs are approved by the SecDef, JS/J3 (the Joint Force Coordinator) tasks the AF Service Force Provider for capabilities which are sourced via the AF MAJCOMs to obtain  appropriate  AFFORs.    Forces  are  then  provided  to  the  appropriate  CCDR  (i.e., CDRUSNORTHCOM or CDRUSPACOM).   4.5.4.1.  The  CCDR  may  delegate  OPCON  via  a  purple  line  to  the  AF  Service Component  (i.e.,  AFNORTH  or  PACAF)  who  then  would  provide  AFFORs  under  the established AETF (i.e., 1 AETF) for presentation to the JFC i.e.,  JTF-Federal  Disaster (JOA 1) in the form of expeditionary forces (see Figure 4.2 #1 gray line to XXX AEW-Complex  Catastrophe).    For  specific  JFACC  missions,  such  as  IAA  or  Catastrophic Incident  Search  and  Rescue,  the  CCDR  may  delegate  TACON  of  the  other  service components’ assets for those specific missions to the CDRAFNORTH/JFACC. As noted in the example, CDRAFNORTH/JFACC has OPCON via a purple line of an IAA AEG and a SAR AEG with TACON via a purple dotted line of sister service SAR assets.   4.5.4.2.  The gray line next to Circle 1 would be an OPCON via a purple line SHOULD the  CCDR  choose  to  have  the  Air  Domain  assets  under  the  AF  Service  Component Commander. In other words, “blue working for blue” (see  #1 and Notes with the single *asterisk). the  1AETF (CDRAFNORTH/JFACC)  OPCON  of  the  AEF  forces,  in  this  example  XXX  AEW-Complex Catastrophe with subordinate Groups (e.g., XXX Air Expeditionary Ops Group, XXX  Air  Expeditionary  Support  Group,  Air  Expeditionary  Medical  Group,  etc.,)  with   This  would  be  AF  preferred  way  of  having AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 43 subordinate Air Expeditionary Squadrons under each group.  Note:   forces  can  only  be under the OPCON of a single commander at one time. 4.5.4.3.  Usually,  the  example  in  paragraph  4.5.4.2.  above  does  not  occur.    In  this instance, as reflected in Figure 4.2, the CCDR normally delegates OPCON via a purple line (refer to Circle 2) of the AFFORs (i.e., the AEW and subordinate AEGs/AESs, etc.) to  the  JTF  Commander.  Reference  paragraph  4.5.3.,  addressed  the  USNORTHCOM established  relationships  between  the  JTF  and  CDRARNORTH/JFLCC  as  an  Option identified in its CONPLAN 3500, Annex J; see #2 and Notes with **asterisks.  Specified ADCON  (indicated  by  the  dotted  black  line)  of  the  Air  Expeditionary  Forces (AEW/AEG/AES or elements) extends from the COMAFFOR through the AETF to these fielded  forces.    The  CCDR  will  normally  have  OPCON  (if  not  further  delegated  to  his service  components/functional  components)  as  established  the  Federal  chain  of command.  4.5.5.  When a State JTF is established and the President via the SecDef and the Governor of the State determine it is  customary and proper for the establishment of a DSC the construct presented in Figure 4.2. is used as indicated in the box identified as GOVERNOR STATE X EOC (State JOA 2).   The Governor of the State through the State TAG will have command of the State ARNG/ANG forces.   4.5.5.1.  The CCDR delegates OPCON via a purple line for the attached Title 10 forces to  the  DSC  and  the  DSC  exercises  OPCON  through  the  Title  10  U.S.C.  Deputy Commander (indicated by via a purple line with the Circle 3 next to it – see #3).  Title 10 U.S.C. AFFORs (i.e., AEG with subordinate forces are noted below the Circle 4 – see #4) are presented by the CCDR to the DSC.  Specified ADCON (dotted black line) goes via  the  COMAFFOR  through  the  AETF,  AEW  and  any  subordinate  AEGs/AESs,  etc., when employed as illustrated below. 4.5.5.2.  Direct  support  is  provided  by    Federal    forces  to  the  DSC  or  to  FEMA  as depicted  by  the  green  line.  CCDRs  will  identify  the  command  relationships  for  their forces  which  are  noted  in  their  applicable  CONPLANs  or  as  addressed  in  their  orders during execution. 44 AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 Figure 4.2.  Command Relationships and Command and Control (C2) Construct and Force Presentation for DSCA Operations with Federal/State DSC JOAs 4.6.  Other C2 Constructs with AFFORs.  4.6.1.  Figure 4.3. reflects the RFA process for obtaining AF assets specifically utilized ISO National  Interagency  Fire  Center  (NIFC)  Wildland  Firefighting  (WFF)  operations.    Once forces  are  approved  based  on  the  RFA,  up  to  eight  MAFFS  equipped  C-130  aircraft  with associated aircrews and  support personnel  may be provide  ISO of the NIFC.  The 302 AW (AFRC)  at  Peterson  AFB,  CO  and  three  ANG  units,  the  146  AW  at  Channel  Islands  ANG Base, CA; 145 AW at Charlotte ANG Base, NC; and the 153 AW at Cheyenne ANG Base, WY  have  been  conducting  these  WFF  operations  ISO  NIFC  for  over  40  years.  Since  the advent  of  USNORTHCOM  the  mission  is  tasked  to  the  CDRAFNORTH/JFACC.    When employed in a Title 32 U.S.C. status ANG assets remain under the control and authority of their respective governors.  Figure 4.3. illustrates employment of the ANG MAFFS reflecting Title  32  U.S.C.  status  whereby  a  coordinating  authority  relationship  is  maintained  between the  ANG  MAFFS,  the  deployed  AEG  commander  and  CDRAFNORTH/JFACC  who is  the Commander, 1 AETF.  AFRC MAFFS assets are under OPCON  (via solid  purple  line) of the  CDRAFNORTH/JFACC  with  delegation  of  TACON  (via  purple  dotted  line)  to  the AEG  Commander.    Figure  4.4.  represents  the  C2  relationship  should  the  ANG  assets  be placed in a Title 10 U.S.C. status. 4.6.2.  Each figure denotes how MAFFS are requested and utilized by the WFF IC.  Upon the WFF  IC  request  for  aerial  tanker  support  through  the  firefighting  district  headquarters,  the request  is  then  submitted  to  the  Geographical  Area  Coordination  Center  (GACC).    The AFI10-801  23 DECEMBER 2015 45 GACC  Aviation  Branch  reviews,  validates,  and  sources  tanker  assets  based  on  tanker resource  available  from  established  contractor  assets.    Should  GACC  determine  that  tanker asset  (i.e.,  contractor)  shortfalls  exist,  the  GACC  sends  RFA  to  NIFC  to  request  additional DOD tanker (MAFFS) support.  NIFC sends RFA through the DCO for validation (normally located  at  Boise,  ID  if  activated)  who  then  forwards  to  USNORTHCOM  for  further validation.  USNORTHCOM forwards the RFA to JS/J3; if no DCO has been activated the RFA goes from NIFC directly to JS/J3.  JS/J3 validates after coordinating with the Services, USTRANSCOM  and  its  AF  service  component  (18  AF)  as  well  NGB  and  AF/A33  as appropriate. 4.6.3.  JS/J3  sources  the  requirement  to  the  force  providers  (e.g.,  ANG  or  AFRC).    ACC establishes  a  standing  AEG,  prior  to  start  of  WFF  season.    The  CJCS  DSCA  EXORD transfers OPCON/TACON from USTRANSCOM to USNORTHCOM who further delegates OPCON/  TACON  of  Title  10  U.S.C.  MAFFS  to  CDRAFNORTH/JFACC.    Coordinating authority  is  designated  to  CDRAFNORTH/JFACC  and  to  the  AEG  commander  for  those MAFFS assets in Title 32 U.S.C. status.  4.6.4.  MAFFS  assets  (aircraft/crews/support  forces)  deploy  to  designated  employment location and are included into the GACC’s tanker resource pool for execution of WFF aerial fire suppression operations on a rotational basis as determined by their priority position IAW GACC tanker sourcing procedures.
