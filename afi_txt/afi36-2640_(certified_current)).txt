FD  will  develop  institutional  and  occupational  competencies  in  all  Airmen  through education,  training,  and  experience  opportunities  to  satisfy  current  and  future  Air  Force  mission requirements.    FD  is  dynamic  and  deliberate  by  design.    It  depends  on  underlying  processes  which integrate and synchronize senior leader perspectives, institutional requirements, and modeling tools used to forecast those requirements (both qualitative and quantitative) with far more precision and rigor than previous strategic planning processes. 1.1.1.   FD  leverages  the  Continuum  of  Learning  (CoL),  a  career-long  process  of  individual development.  The CoL is designed to deliberately integrate developmental opportunities through the Institutional Competencies List (ICL) a common taxonomy used to produce adaptable, knowledge-enabled Airmen for today and tomorrow. 1.1.2.  The execution of FD will: 1.1.2.1.   Maximize  capabilities  of  all  Airmen  to  ensure  the  USAF  can  provide  air,  space  an d cyberspace power in support of our nation’s security. 1.1.2.2.  Ensure opportunities and expectations are transparent, providing visibility to all Airmen. 1.1.2.3.  Develop a broad, deep pool of qualified candidates for key positions within the USAF. 1.1.2.4.  Deliberately connect all training and education opportunities to assignment/deployment experiences  to  best  leverage  the  CoL  to  build  and  enhance  institutional  and  occupational competencies in individual Airmen. 1.1.2.5.  Ensure USAF personnel-directed decision processes invest the right education, training, and experience in competitively-selected Airmen at the right time. 1.1.2.6.  Enhance each Airman’s understanding of his or her role in FD. 1.1.2.7.    Identify  institutional  competency  expectations  to  facilitate  FD  decisions  through deliberate utilization of the Institutional Competency List. 1.1.2.8.  Leverage information technology to provide useful tools to facilitate/enhance personnel decision processes and to maximize the capabilities of all Airmen. 1.1.2.9.    Identify  competency  requirements  at  each  grade  in  order  to  ensure  experience, education,  and  training  programs  are  appropriately  focused  to  produce  desired  Airman capabilities. 1.1.2.10.  Ensure Airmen and supervisors understand institutional expectations relating to FD. 1.1.2.11.    Provide  the  framework  for  foundational,  occupational  and  institutional  competency development and identification. (See Attachment 4, Force Development Construct). 1.1.3.  The provisions of this instruction are intended for application to  officers in  grades O-5 and below, enlisted personnel in grades E-8 and below, and all DAF civilians. Any references in this AFI to ―all ranks‖ are understood to refer to officers below O-6, enlisted below E-9, and DAF civilians below SES. 1.1.4.   FD  is  executed  by  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC),  Directorate  of  Assignments,  for Active Duty officer and enlisted personnel; Air Reserve Command (AFRC), Manpower, Personnel, AFI36-2640  16 DECEMBER 2008 3 and  Services  Directorate,  for  AF  Reserve  officer  and  enlisted  personnel;  Director,  National  Guard Bureau  (NGB),  for  ANG  officer  and  enlisted  personnel;  and  AFPC,  Directorate  of  Civilian  Force Integration, for DAF civilians.  Career Field Managers (CFM) communicate the education, training, and  experience  requirements  of  the  functional  community.    DTs  facilitate  execution  of  FD  for officers and civilian equivalents by providing long and short-term vectors. 1.2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 1.2.1.   Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for  Manpower  and  Reserve  Affairs  (SAF/MR).   SAF/MR serves as an agent of the Secretary and provides guidance, direction, and oversight for all matters  pertaining  to  the  formulation,  review,  and  execution  of  plans,  policies,  programs,  and budgets addressing FD. 1.2.2.  Deputy  Chief  of Staff,  Manpower,  Personnel  and Services.  HQ  USAF/A1   will develop and ensure implementation of FD policy. 1.2.2.1.

Senior  Rater,  Commander,  Supervisor.     Senior  Rater,  Commander  and  Supervisor involvement  is  essential  to  FD.    Their  input  is  critical  for  making  deliberate  FD  decisions  about individual members and identifying and maximizing the capabilities of Airmen.  These leaders must make informed recommendations IAW eligibility and selection criteria. 1.2.9.1.   Supervisor.    Plays  an  integral  role  in  supporting  all  aspects  of  FD  through  mentoring and  feedback  as  documented  on  the  web-based  ADP/DE  Preferences/Statement  of  Intent  tool, and  nomination  packages  for  competitively  selected  programs.

Force  Management  and  Development  Council  (FMDC).    This  corporate  body  provides  an institutional perspective on USAF-wide force management and development issues and makes strategic level  recommendations  to  the  SecAF  and  CSAF.    The  VCSAF  chairs  the  FMDC.      The  AF/A1,  FAs, MAJCOM/CVs, CMSAF, AFRC/CV, NGB/CF, and SAF/MR are members of the FMDC.  The AU/CC and  USAFA/CC  will  be  advisors  to  the  FMDC.        The  FMDC  will  meet  semi-annually  and  will  be administratively supported by the Directorate of Force Development, AF/A1D. 2.2.    FMDC  Panels:   The  FMDC  has  several  subordinate  bodies,  focused  on  both  population  and function: 2.2.1.   Enlisted,  Officer,  and  Civilian  FD  Panels.     These  panels  make  recommendations  to  the FMDC relating to effective development and utilization of Airmen.  Additionally they guide future FD  efforts  and  synchronize  functional  community,  MAJCOM  and  HQ  USAF  FD  initiatives.  Specific panel membership is identified in each panel charter.  Charters will be revised as necessary.  Administrative support will be provided by the Directorate of Force Development, AF/A1D. 2.2.2.  Air Force Learning Council (AFLC ).  This council makes recommendations to the FMDC on  the  desired  outcomes  for  AF  institutional  competency  development  programs.    The  panel provides  a  systematic  process  through  which  the  consumers  of  institutional  competency development programs (e.g., MAJCOMs, COCOMs, Functional Authorities) can guide the outcome –  through  curriculum  as  well  as  the  Special  Areas  of  Emphasis,  to  identify  specific  subject  matter that should receive emphasis and/or priority in AF institutional competency development programs Specific  council  membership  is  identified  in  the  charter  and  will  be  revise  as  necessary.  Administrative support will be provided by the Directorate of Force Development, AF/A1D. 2.2.3.  Advisory Panels.  FD acknowledges the need to develop and manage populations of Airmen assigned  to  disparate  Air  Force  specialties,  but  which  aggregate  to  produce  vital  AF  capabilities.  The  Nuclear,  Space  Professional,  Cyberspace,  Information  Operations,  and  International  Affairs communities, while not authorized to establish DTs, have valid FD requirements involving officers and DAF civilians assigned to AFSCs outside their core functional area.  The Air Force recognizes these  communities  must  generate  and  implement  FD  and  management  strategies  to  sustain  and improve  such  capabilities.  NOTE:   This  paragraph  does  not  apply  to  the  civilian  International Affairs Career Field (IACF) 2.2.3.1.  These and other similar populations are encouraged to establish Advisory Panels.  Such panels  may  provide  advice,  guidance  and  assistance  to  the  CFMs  and  DTs  on  how  best  to develop and employ Airmen to deliver desired capabilities. 2.2.3.2.  Advisory panels must provide their desired inputs for affected DTs to individual CFMs NLT 30 calendar days prior to each scheduled DT session.  Advisory panel inputs must include a summary of the requirement, to include the grade, AFSC, experience level, and number of valid personnel authorizations that must be filled. AFI36-2640  16 DECEMBER 2008 9 Figure 2.1.  Force Management and Development Governance Structure   10 AFI36-2640  16 DECEMBER 2008 Chapter 3 DEVELOPMENT TEAMS 3.1.   Overview.     FD  for  officers  and  civilian  equivalents  is  managed  by  Development  Teams  (DTs).  Ideally, DTs are chaired by general officers or members of the Senior Executive Service comprised of senior  officers  and  equivalent  civilians.    The  Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC)  is  highly  encouraged  to establish and use DTs to manage FD of  its officer corps.  When a DT is established, it will follow the instructions  contained  in  this  publication.   Where  ARC  CoL  processes  vary  from  AD  processes,  ARC DTs  will  make  necessary  adjustments  to  account  for  differences  (e.g.,  projected  requirements, assignment trigger points, and deployment opportunities). 3.1.1.   DTs  play  a  critical  role  in  developing  officers  and  DAF  civilians  to  support  current  and projected mission capabilities.  Among other things, they ensure senior leadership within each career field  becomes  familiar  with  the  people  assigned  to  their  functional  area,  making  assessments  of member  potential  for  future  opportunities;  prepare  senior leaders  with  a  comprehensive understanding of both functional and institutional personnel requirements; and balance institutional and functional requirements for utilization of individual officers and DAF civilians. 3.2.  DT Establishment.  DTs should develop an understanding of both officers and civilians resources and  requirements,  and  ensure  all  career  field  members  are  provided  with  appropriate  development opportunities.  Functional Managers will integrate officer and DAF civilian DTs to the maximum extent possible.  FMs who do not feel the integration of military and civilian DTs facilitates AF FD objectives must provide rationale to AF/A1D through their DTs. 3.3.  DT Membership. 3.3.1.  Ideally, the FA should appoint the FM as the DT chair.  The FA may appoint someone other than  the  FM  as  DT  Chair  when  it  is  not  feasible  for  the  FM  to  fulfill  this  role.    FA  must  notify AF/A1D when they elect to appoint someone other than the FM to serve as DT Chair. 3.3.2.   DT  membership  will  be  determined  by  the  FM.  In  addition  to  the  DT  Chair  and  the  CFM, voting members of the DT may include the CFM, key FD stakeholders (O-6/PB-3 or higher), such as Air Staff Directors/Deputy Directors or Air Staff-level subject matter experts, and MAJCOM-level functional  leadership  (O-6/PB-3  or  higher).    The  FM  may  also  include  Joint  Service  and  ARC representatives,  as  well  as  sitting  wing  commanders/directors  (O-6/PB-3  or  higher),  as  voting members.  DTs should ideally have no more than 50 percent turn over of members from meeting to meeting.    DTs  will  also  have  representatives  from  officer  assignment  teams  (designated  by AFPC/DPA) and/or civilian career field teams (designated by AFPC/DPI), as appropriate to ensure standardization and provide administrative and logistical support. 3.3.3.   Certain  cross-functional  communities,  such  as  Space  Professional,  Nuclear,  International Affairs  (officers  only),  Information  Operations,  etc.,  while  not  authorized  to  establish  DTs,  have valid  FD  requirements  involving  officers  and  DAF  civilians  assigned  various  Air  Force Specialties/Occupational Series.  Representatives from these communities may attend applicable DT sessions  with  prior  approval  of  the  appropriate  FM. NOTE:   This  paragraph  does  not  apply  to  the civilian International Affairs Career Field (IACF). 3.4.  Annual DT Guidance.  AF/A1 will provide updated general guidance on DT objectives annually.  AFPC  and  ARPC  will  codify  this  guidance  in  separate  Concepts  of  Operation  (CONOPS)  and  review AFI36-2640  16 DECEMBER 2008 11 their  respective  CONOPS  annually.    Changes  to  either  DT  CONOPS  (if  needed)  will  be  coordinated with AF/A1 before publication. 3.5.  DT Responsibilities. 3.5.1.  DTs will identify the education, training,  and experiences  appropriate for officers and DAF civilian  equivalents  within  each  functional  community  based  on  current  and  future  requirements.  This  includes  education  and  training  opportunities  funded  by  the  USAF  or  pursued  as  self-development  by  officers  and  DAF  civilians.    DTs  will  provide  feedback  to  CFMs/CFTs  to  update career field pyramid(s) as necessary. 3.5.2.   DTs  will  understand  career  field  policies,  plans,  programs,  training,  and  actions  affecting career field management and development and will take these issues into consideration when making personnel decisions and vectors. 3.5.3.   Each  DT  meeting  will  begin  with  an  overview  of  existing  and  projected  requirements,  to include 365-day existing deployment opportunities and existing and projected authorized strength. 3.5.4.  DTs will make vectors based on projected/anticipated, aggregated requirements by level and position  type.    A  vector  is  the  DT’s  collective  recommendation  for  an  experience  level  (e.g.,  Joint Staff,  Air  Staff,  MAJCOM,  base-level,  etc.).  training  or  education  opportunity  (e.g.,  resident  DE, advanced  functional  training),  or  position  type  (e.g.,  flight  commander,  division  chief,  instructor, special duty, etc.) a member should be considered for in his or her next or subsequent assignments. 3.5.5.  DTs will use career planning diagrams (i.e. career development pyramid) to make informed vector recommendations and will assist FMs and CFMs with updating this guidance based on career field dynamics as well as current and projected personnel requirements. 3.5.6.  DTs will review career field Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) posturing and coding to ensure capabilities are visible and properly aligned in the AEF. 3.5.7.   DTs  must  consider  cross-functional  developmental  and  utilization  requirements  when recommending  vectors  for  their  officers  and  DAF  civilians.    Cross-functional  OPRs  must  identify their requirements to individual CFMs/CFTs NLT 30 days prior to each scheduled DT session.  DT chairs,  CFMs,  and  ATs/CFTs  must  ensure  these  cross-functional  requirements  are  appropriately addressed during DT sessions. 3.5.8.  CFMs will provide DT dates to AFPC/DPAPF NLT 60 days prior to each DT.  AF/A1 will post DT dates in the respective Officer and Civilian Development Pages on the Air Force Portal. 3.5.9.  DTs will provide vector recommendations for DAF civilians selected for  career broadening developmental assignments at least one year prior to completion of the program.  For example, DAF civilian employees identified for graduation in Fall 2009 will receive a post-broadening vector from the Fall 2008 DT or from an outplacement DT at least one year prior to completion. 3.5.10.   DTs  will  provide  vector  recommendations  for  DAF  civilians  selected  for  resident Developmental Education (DE) programs during their first DT session following the annual public release of DE selections.  For example, DAF civilians identified on the Fall 2007 DE announcement (for Academic Year 08/09) will receive a post-school vector from the Spring 2008 DT, or from the Summer 2008 DT, whichever occurs first. 3.5.11.   DTs  will  provide  career  feedback  to  officers,  civilians,  senior  raters,  and  commanders  via the automated Airmen Development Plan system or other similar process. 12 AFI36-2640  16 DECEMBER 2008 3.5.12.  DTs will use Special Selection panel configuration to determine officer DEDB nominations, Squadron  Commander/Director  Candidate  Lists,  BDE  (AFERB-sponsored)  programs,  Advanced Studies  Group  nominations,  and  AF/A1-approved  functionally-sponsored  development  programs.  MAJCOM/CVs  may  request  AF/A1  approval  to  conduct  Squadron  Commander/Director  Special Panel separately from the DT. 3.5.13.  Officers who are identified as ―selects‖  for resident DE programs must not  be expected to have  completed  a  corresponding  non-resident  course  in  order  to  be  recommended  for  resident  DE attendance. 3.5.14.  DTs will ensure personnel vectored for Joint duty assignment consideration are of sufficient quality to achieve promotion rates in accordance with joint promotion objectives outlined in Title 10 United States Code, Section 662, Promotion Policy Objectives for Joint Officers. 3.5.15.  Active component DTs will meet two times per year at a minimum.  ARC DTs will meet as determined by DT Chairs.  Specific times will be determined by the FM or Career Field Manager but will  fall  into  standardized  windows  for  the  Active  component:    Fall  (October-December);  Spring (January-April);  and  Summer  (May-September).    Active  component  DT  meetings  will  be  held  at AFPC and must be coordinated with AFPC.   Table 3.1. illustrates the recommended agenda items. Table 3.1.  DT Meeting Recommended Schedule and Agenda Items RECOMMENDED MEETING RECOMMENDED AGENDA ITEMS* Fall (Oct-Dec) Outplacement vectors for IDE/SDE/CDE students and squadron commanders, BDE (AFERB-sponsored activities) selection; A1-approved functionally-sponsored development program selection, steady- state vectors Spring (Jan-Apr) Steady-state vectors Summer (May-Sept) DEDB nominations; Squadron Commander/Director Candidates List; identify Airmen for temporary release to perform duties outside career field (e.g., instructor duty, IAS ) Note:  DT will provide vector recommendations for DAF civilians selected for career broadening developmental assignments at least one year prior to completion of the program.  This may occur during any/all of the annual DT meetings.  3.6.  General Provisions. 3.6.1.  Bid and match process for Squadron Commander/Director vacancies will take place after the DEDB  release  with  selections  coming  from  the  identified  candidate  lists.    Exceptions  must  be approved by MAJCOM/CVs. 3.6.2.   Nominations  for  Developmental  Education  will  normally  be  reviewed  by  DTs  in  the  May through  August  timeframe.    Results  will  be  forwarded  to  the  Civilian  Developmental  Education Board (when appropriate) and the Developmental Education Designation Board. AFI36-2640  16 DECEMBER 2008 13 3.6.3.  Career field-specific FD efforts, to include automated systems designed to support functional FD initiatives, must be approved by AF/A1D.

Mission:  Make vectors based on projected, aggregated requirements by level and position type.  A  vector  is  the  DT’s  collective  recommendation  for  an  assignment  level  (e.g.,  Joint  Staff,  Air  Staff, MAJCOM,  base-level,  etc.),  training  or  education  opportunity  (e.g.,  resident  DE,  advanced  functional training), or position type (e.g., flight commander, division chief, instructor, special duty, etc.) for which a member should be considered in subsequent assignments. A3.2.  Authority:  As directed by AFI 36-2640, Executing Force Development.  This charter remains in effect until terminated or superseded per direction of the convening authorities. A3.3.   Purpose:   This charter gives authorization to the DT to provide the necessary tools and formal guidance to officers/DAF civilians to maximize capabilities of all officers and DAF civilians to ensure the USAF can provide air, space and cyberspace power in support of our nation’s security. A3.3.1.  Implementation will be realized through a series of deliberate and rewarding challenges in education, training, and experiences. A3.4.  Roles and Responsibilities:  Areas within the purview and influence of the DT include, but are not limited to (ref AFI 36-2640): A3.4.1.    Identify  the  education,  training,  and  experiences  (both  self-development  and  corporately resourced) appropriate for officers and DAF civilian equivalents within each functional community based on current and future requirements. A3.4.2.  DTs will make vectors based on projected, aggregated requirements  by level  and position type, and use career path diagrams to inform their vector recommendations. A3.4.3.  Will consider and address cross-functional utilization requirements. A3.5.    Terms  of  Agreement:    This  charter  will  be  subject  to  annual  review,  and  to  renewal  or amendment  at  such  time  that  is  deemed  necessary.    If  a  requirement  changes,  any  signatory  to  this agreement may initiate changes or amendments as necessary. ________________________________ Signature of FM or designated DT Chair  30 AFI36-2640  16 DECEMBER 2008 Attachment 4 FORCE DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCT Figure A4.1.
