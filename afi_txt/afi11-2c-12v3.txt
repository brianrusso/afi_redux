This instruction provides policy for operating the C-12 aircraft.  When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source document, that document takes precedence.  For matters  where  this  AFI  is  the  source  document,  waiver  authority  is  IAW  paragraph  1.4.    For matters  where  this  AFI  repeats  information  in  another  document,  follow  waiver  authority outlined in the basic/source document. (T-2) 1.1.1.  Unit  commanders  and  agency  directors  involved  with  or  supporting  C-12  operations shall make current copies of this AFI available to appropriate personnel. (T-2) 1.2.  Applicability.  This  AFI  applies  to  aircrew  members,  support  personnel,  contractors,  and supervisors involved with employing C-12 aircraft. (T-2) 1.3.  Key Words explained. 1.3.1.  "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.3.2.  "Should" indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment. 1.3.3.  "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.4.  "NOTE"  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  considered  essential  to emphasize. 1.3.5.  “CAUTION”  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  which  could  result  in damage to equipment if not carefully followed. 1.3.6.  “WARNING”  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  which  could  result  in personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed. 1.4.  Deviations  and  Waivers.  Do  not  deviate  from  policies  in  this  AFI  except  when  the situation  demands  immediate  action  to  ensure  safety.    The  Pilot  in  Command  (PIC)  is  vested with ultimate mission authority and responsible for each course-of-action taken. (T-2) 1.4.1.  Deviations.    The  PIC  shall  report  deviations  or  exceptions  taken  without  waiver through command channels to the appropriate waiver authority within 24 hours and to Chief, MAJCOM  Stan/Eval  within  48-hours.    MAJCOM  Stan/Eval  shall  in  turn  notify  AFMC Stan/Eval  (lead  command)  as  appropriate  if  follow-on  action  is  required.    The  PIC  shall collect background information and upon request submit a follow-up written report. (T-2) 1.4.2.  Waivers.  Unless otherwise directed, waiver authority for contents of this instruction is the MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority.  For waivers requiring Lead MAJCOM approval,  email  AFMC  Form  73,  AFMC  Flight  Operations  Waiver  Request,  through  user MAJCOM/A3V to afmc.a3v@eglin.af.mil. (T-2) 1.4.2.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. 1.4.2.1.1.  “Tier  0”    (T-0)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority. AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   11  1.4.2.1.2.  “Tier  1”    (T-1)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance  may  put  airman,  mission,  or  program  strongly  at  risk,  and  may  only  be waived  by  the  MAJCOM/CC  or  delegate  with  concurrence  of  publication  approver.  When multiple MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate. 1.4.2.1.3.  “Tier 2”  (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially put the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate. 1.4.2.1.4.  “Tier  3”    (T-3)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance has a remote risk of mission failure, and may be waived by the Wing/CC but no lower than the OG/CC. 1.4.2.2.  Units  requesting  a  waiver  will  submit  detailed  staff  package  including justification and impact to operations if waiver is not granted. 1.5.  Supplemental  Procedures.  This  AFI  is  a  basic  directive.    Each  using  MAJCOM  may supplement  this  AFI  according  to  AFPD  11-2,  Aircrew  Operations,  and  AFI  33-360, Publications and Forms Management.  Stipulate unique MAJCOM procedures (shall not be less restrictive than this basic document) and publish MAJCOM/A3 approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM supplement. 1.5.1.  Coordination  Process.    Email  supplements  and  AF  Form  673,  Request  to  Issue Publication to AFMC/A3V ( AFMC.A3V@eglin.af.mil) for coordination.  (T-2) 1.6.  Local Supplement Coordination Process.  Operations Group commanders (OG/CCs) may define local supplements to this instruction.  OG/CCs shall obtain approval from Numbered Air Force  (NAF),  if  applicable,  and  MAJCOM  prior  to  releasing  supplement. (T-2) 1.7.  Requisition  and  Distribution  Procedures.  Unit  commanders  shall  ensure  aircrew members and associated support personnel have current copies of this AFI. (T-2) 1.8.  Definitions.  Find explanations or definitions of terms and abbreviations commonly used in the  aviation  community  in  DoD  Flight  Information  Publication,  General  Planning,  Chapter  2.   See Attachment 1 for common terms used herein.   12  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 Chapter 2 COMMAND AND CONTROL 2.1.  General.  Command  and  control  of  Air  Force  C-12  aircraft  will  be  established  by  using MAJCOMs.    When  C-12  aircrews  are  supporting  contingency  operations  outside  their MAJCOM,  the  aircrews  will  be  informed  by  their  MAJCOM  what  agency  is  vested  with exercising operational control.  United States (US) Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, or the Civil Air Patrol pilots/crew members flying Air Force owned C-12 aircraft will comply with this AFI. (T-2) 2.1.1.  For  the  purposes  of  this  regulation,  the  Defense  Intelligence  Agency  (DIA)  is considered a MAJCOM and the Chief, DIA Air and Maritime Operations, is equivalent to an Air Force OG/CC. 2.2.  Execution  Authority.  Execution  authority  for  missions  should  normally  be  received through  the  local  command  element.    Commanders  with  execution  authority  formulate  plans, allocate  assets,  and  approve  PICs  to  carry  out  directed  or  training  missions  through  a  local command post or Command and Control (C2) element.  OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local  training  missions.    Squadron  Commanders  (SQ/CCs)  or  their  designated  representatives assign  airlift  missions  to  PICs.    PICs  hold  execution  authority  for  missions  operating  outside normal communication channels (use last known mission orders or best course of action).  (T-2) 2.2.1.  Off-Station Trainers (OST).  Approval  authority is the Group Commander (OG/CC). (T-2) 2.2.2.  Supplemental  Training  Mission  (STM).    Opportune  airlift  of  cargo  and  mission personnel  may  be  accomplished  as  a  by-product  of  crew  training  missions.    The  training mission will not be degraded in any manner to accomplish the STM. (T-2) 2.3.  Pilot  in  Command  Responsibility  and  Authority.  Unit  commanders  shall  designate  a Mission Pilot  (MP),  Instructor Pilot  (IP), or Evaluator Pilot  (EP) as the PIC for all flights  on a flight authorization form IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.  PICs are: 2.3.1.  In command of all persons aboard the aircraft. (T-2) 2.3.2.  Vested  with  authority  to  accomplish  the  assigned  mission.    The  PIC  shall  only  fly events  authorized  in  the  mission  tasking  unless  in  the  PIC’s  judgment  an  emergency condition demands otherwise. (T-2) 2.3.3.  The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority. (T-2) 2.3.4.  The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers. (T-2) 2.3.5.  Responsible for passing mission progress reports to C2 agents. (T-2) 2.3.6.  Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel and  will  establish  a  point-of-contact  (POC)  with  the  appropriate  C2  agent  prior  to  entering crew rest. (T-2) 2.3.7.  Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP), passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   13  2.3.8.  Responsible for ensuring all passengers are manifested properly. (T-2) 2.4.  Mission  Clearance  Decision.  When  conditions  do  not  warrant  starting  or  continuing  a mission,  the  executing  agency  or  the  PIC  may  decide  to  delay  a  mission.    If  the  PIC  refuses  a mission, the mission will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or improved so that the mission can operate safely.  Another PIC will not be tasked to take the same mission under the same conditions. (T-2) 2.5.  Aircrew  Responsibilities.  The  local  C2  agency  is  the  focal  point  for  all  mission  support activities.    The  PIC  must  inform  C2  of  any  factor  that  may  affect  mission  accomplishment.  When  transiting  a  stop  without  a  C2  agency,  the  PIC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  necessary mission information is placed into the C2 system by the most expeditious means available. (T-2) 2.6.  Operational  C2  Reporting.  All  units  will  establish  C2  reporting  procedures  and requirements.    Aircrews  on  operational  missions  will  transmit  an  arrival  advisory  to  the destination C2 when applicable. (T-2) 2.7.  Mission    Commander.  A  mission  commander  shall  be  designated  when  two  or  more aircraft are assembled to execute a mission.  The mission commander is accountable for mission execution and will ensure all pre/post mission coordination is accomplished. (T-2) 2.8.  Law  Enforcement  Support.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  DoD  to  cooperate  with  civilian  law enforcement  officials  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable.    AFI  10-801,  Defense  Support  of Civilian Authorities (DSCA), provides the policies and procedures service members must follow when  supporting  federal,  state,  and  local  civilian  law  enforcement  agencies.    Coordinate  all civilian  law  enforcement  authorities’  requests  for  assistance  through  appropriate  C2  channels. (T-2)   14  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 Chapter 3 AIRCREW MANAGEMENT 3.1.  Aircrew  Qualification.  Primary  crewmembers  or  those  occupying  a  primary  position during flight must be qualified or in training for qualification.  If noncurrent, or in training for a particular  event,  the  crewmember  must  be  under  the  supervision  of  an  instructor  while accomplishing that event (direct supervision for critical phases of flight). (T-2) 3.2.  Pilots 3.2.1.  Missions with Passengers.  Ensure pilot qualifications are IAW AFI 11-401.  Touch-and-go landings with passengers on board are prohibited (does not apply to MEPs, see para 9.3). (T-2) 3.2.2.  Training  Sorties.    Ensure  crew  composition  is  IAW  AFI  11-401.    Mission qualification training and mission evaluations may be conducted on missions with passengers on board provided the individual in training possesses a current AF Form 8 for basic aircraft qualification. (T-2) 3.3.  Crew  Composition.  Minimum  crew  complement  is  one  Pilot  In  Command/Aircraft Commander and one additional pilot. (T-2) 3.4.  Additional  Crewmember  (ACM).  Comply with AFI 11-401 when granting ACM status. (T-2) 3.5.  Mission  Essential  Personnel  (MEP).  MEP  status  is  granted  to  certain  individuals performing  unique  support  duties  directly  associated  with  and  essential  to  a  particular  aircraft, aircrew,  or  mission.    MEP  authority  must  be  on  the  individual’s  orders  or  other  written authorization. (T-2) 3.6.  Distinguished  Visitor  (DV)  Operating  Procedures.  Pilot  rated  senior  staff  members (DV7s or above) who have completed a familiarization course may occupy either pilot seat under direct IP supervision.  These individuals will log OP for flight authorization duty code on the Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781,  ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.  Do not  carry passengers while conducting senior staff familiarization flights  unless the senior staff member possesses a current AF Form 8 for basic aircraft qualification. (T-2) 3.7.  Alerting  Procedures.  C-12  Aircrews  will  normally  self-alert.    If  C2  will  accomplish  the alert then the PIC must be informed prior to the start of crew rest and will notify the crew. (T-2) 3.7.1.  C2 Alerts.  Aircrew alert time is normally 3+00 hours before scheduled takeoff time (allows  1  hour  for  reporting  and  2+00  hours  for  mission  preparation).    Individual  locations may increase or decrease this time depending on local capabilities. (T-3) 3.7.1.1.  The  PIC  may  arrange  an  alert  time  that  provides  additional  preparation  time.  The PIC may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows.  In  all  cases,  the  PIC  shall  coordinate  changes  to  standard  alerting  times  with  the appropriate C2 agency. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   15  3.7.1.2.  C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there is reasonable  assurance  that  maintenance  technicians  will  complete  repairs  that  allow  the aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time. (T-2) 3.7.1.3.  C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-3 status  until  maintenance  technicians  determine  required  parts  are  available  and  the aircraft will be repaired within the scheduled ground time. (T-2) 3.7.2.  Aircrew Release.  The aircrew release policy is as follows: 3.7.2.1.  On the aircrew’s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2 agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time. (T-2) 3.7.2.2.  For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected alert time.    The  PIC  may  extend  that  window  to  8  hours  when  flying  as  primary  crew  or  12 hours when flying in deadhead status.  The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept more than the 6 hour window. (T-2) 3.7.2.3.  When  a  C2  agent  determines  circumstances  will  not  allow  for  aircrew  alerting during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time, the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours from the time of notification. (T-2) 3.7.2.4.  At  the  end  of  the  legal  for  alert  window,  the  PIC  will  contact  a  C2  agent  and establish a new expected alert time. (T-2) 3.8.  Crew  Rest,  Fatigue  Management  and  Flight  Duty  Limitations.  See  AFI  11-202V3, General Flight Rules, Chapter 9. 3.9.  Flight  Duty  Period  (FDP).  FDP  is  the  time  period  between  mission  reporting  and  final aircraft engine shutdown. 3.9.1.  Maximum FDP for operational missions is 16 hours. (T-2) 3.9.1.1.  Maximum  FDP  on  operational  missions  is  reduced  to  12  hours  when  flying without an operative autopilot pitch axis.  Do not takeoff with an inoperative autopilot if the planned flight duration will exceed a 12 hour FDP.  Crews may exceed the 12 hour FDP restriction if the autopilot failed after takeoff. (T-2) 3.9.2.  Maximum FDP for training missions is 14 hours.  Do not conduct practice instrument approaches,  touch  and  go  landings,  or  conduct  simulated  emergency  procedures  after  12 hours of FDP. (T-2) 3.9.3.  Deadhead  time  is  that  time  crewmembers  are  positioning  or  depositioning  for  a mission or mission support function.  Crewmembers may perform primary crew duties after deadheading if they do not exceed their FDP which began at reporting time for the deadhead flight.  Crewmembers may deadhead following primary crew duties if they will not exceed a 24-hour FDP beginning at reporting time for primary crew duties. (T-2) 3.10.  Re-entering  Crew  Rest.  PICs  are  granted  the  authority  to  reenter  crew  rest  if  their aircraft  or  mission  (training  or  operational)  is  not  capable  of  departure  within  4  hours  from scheduled  takeoff  time.    The  PIC  shall  evaluate  delay  circumstances  (maintenance  ETIC,  WX forecasts, crew ORM, mission priority, expected duty day, etc.) and inform execution authority of intent to reenter crew rest. (T-2)   16  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 3.11.  Post-Mission  Crew  Rest  (PMCR).  Crewmembers  returning  to  their  home  base  will  be given sufficient time to recover from the cumulative effects of the mission and tend to personal needs.    Crew  rest  begins  immediately  on  mission  termination.    Waiver  authority  for  post- mission crew rest is the OG/CC. (T-3) 3.11.1.  One  hour  of  post-mission  crew  rest  time  (up  to  a  maximum  of  72  hours)  will  be provided for each 3 hours Temporary Duty (TDY) to crewmembers gone from home station more than 24 hours.  PMCR will not run concurrently with predeparture crew rest. (T-3) 3.11.2.  Crewmembers  may  volunteer  to  fly  multiple  back-to-back  Remain  Over  Night (RON) missions that would normally infringe on post-mission crew rest.  In this case, post-mission  crew  rest  may  be  deferred  until  after  the  last  RON  mission.    PMCR  will  be calculated from the start of first mission flown to the end of the last mission flown. (T-3) 3.12.  Standby  Force  Duty.  MAJCOM C2 Agents shall not task units for Standby Force Duty later  than  18  hours  prior  to  Legal  For  Alert  time.    This  allows  crewmembers  12  hours  of  pre- standby crew rest and 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty.  When aircrews are unable to complete all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby crew rest.  If MAJCOM C2 agents are unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest.  SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours.  MAJCOM/A3 may extend this period for contingencies.  After 48 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure crew rest.  OG/CCs may provide additional local procedures for management of Standby Force Duties. (T-2) 3.12.1.  ALFA  Standby  Aircraft  Preflight  Generation  and  Security.    When  tasked,  SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour.  The  following  procedures  apply  to  primary  aircraft  as  well  as  spare  aircraft  generated  for ALFA  alerts.    A  maintenance  Dash  -6  and  aircrew  Dash  -1  preflight  must  be  completed.  Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable TO  After the preflight, the PIC will notify the controlling agency.  The aircraft will remain in a sealed posture and be referred to as ‘cocked on alert’.  Documentation of when the aircraft was cocked on alert must be placed in the forms.  The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before entering crew rest.  Secure all hatches and doors to prevent unauthorized entry.  The aircrew preflight portion remains valid if  performed  by  one  crew,  cocked  on  alert,  and  launched  by  another  crew.    The  PIC  or  a designated aircrew representative must be present if access to the aircraft is required.  Ensure C2 is notified when uncocking and recocking generated aircraft.  Follow-on pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest.  FDP starts at the earlier of either C2 alert for launch or from when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft for pre-flight duties. (T-2) 3.12.2.  BRAVO  Standby  Force.    When  tasked,  SQ/CC  shall    posture  an  aircraft  and/or aircrew  in  BRAVO  Standby  Force  to  permit  launch  within  2  hours  of  unit  notification.  Follow-on  pre-flights,  if  required,  interrupt  crew  rest.    Begin  FDP  when  aircrew  shows  for duty. (T-2) 3.12.3.  CHARLIE  Standby  Force.    When  tasked,  SQ/CC  shall  posture  aircrew  as  a CHARLIE  Standby  Force  ready  to  enter  crew  rest  within  2  hours.    Tasked  aircrew  will  be legal  for  alert  12  hours  after  entering  crew  rest.    SQ/CC  may  keep  aircrews  in  CHARLIE status  up  to  72  hours.    After  72  hours,  release  aircrews  from  CHARLIE  Standby  or  enter them  into  12  hours  crew  rest  for  directed  mission,  training  mission,  or  subsequent  Standby Force duty. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   17  3.12.4.  Wing Standby Force.  OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status.  After a 12 hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be able to launch within 2 hours of unit notification.  After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12 hour crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.  NOTE: OG/CCs should develop local procedures for management of Standby Force Duties. (T-3) 3.12.5.  Post-Standby  Missions.    On  completion  of  standby  duty,  aircrew  members  may  be dispatched on a mission.  If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start of  pre-departure  crew  rest.    If  an  aircrew  member  is  dispatched  on  a  mission,  compute  the post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time. (T-3) 3.12.6.  Post  Standby Crew Rest.    Aircrew members not  dispatched on  a mission following standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows: 3.12.6.1.  If  standby  duty  is  performed  away  from  normal  quarters,  crew  rest  time  is computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time. (T-3) 3.12.6.2.  If  standby  duty  was  performed  in  normal  quarters,  no  crew  rest  time  is authorized. (T-3) 3.13.  Orientation  Flights  and  Incentive  Flights.  IAW  AFI  11-401and  the  appropriate MAJCOM supplement. (T-2) 3.14.  Inter-fly.  Inter-fly is the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between  commands.    A  formal  inter-fly  agreement  is  not  required  for  an  aircrew  member  that occasionally  acts  as  guest  help.   Inter-fly involving the transfer of aircraft  between MAJCOMs must be coordinated and approved through the MAJCOM OPR. (T-2) 3.14.1.  Each  affected  OG/CC  who  commits  resources  (personnel  or  aircraft)  must  concur with the inter-fly proposal.  The inter-fly agreement will detail all training and qualification requirements. (T-3)   18  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 Chapter 4 AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS 4.1.  Objective.  Redundant  systems  may  allow crews to  safely perform  some missions when a component/system  is  degraded/inoperative.    Crews  still  must  comply  with  the  Minimum Essential List requirements.  The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall suitability of an aircraft for the mission.  The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the discrepancy is entered  in  the  AFTO  Form  781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and  Work  Document;  include  the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status. (T-2) 4.1.1.  Mission  Essential  (ME).    The  PIC  will  designate  an  item,  system,  or  subsystem component essential for safe aircraft operation as ME. (T-2) 4.1.2.  Mission  Contributing  (MC).    The  PIC  will  designate  an  item,  system,  or  subsystem component,  which  is  not  currently  essential  for  safe  aircraft  operation  as  MC.    These discrepancies  should  be  cleared  at  the  earliest  opportunity.    If  circumstances  change  or mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME.  Do not delay a mission to clear a MC discrepancy. (T-2) 4.1.3.  Open    Item    (OI).    The  PIC  will  designate  discrepancies  not  expected  to  adversely impact  the  current  mission  or  any  subsequent  mission  as  an  OI.    These  items  are  normally cleared at home station. (T-2) 4.2.  Minimum  Equipment  List  (MEL)  Policy.  The  MEL  catalogues the  minimum equipment/systems required to operate the aircraft.  It is impractical to prepare a list that would anticipate  all  possible  combinations  of  equipment  malfunctions  and  contingent  circumstances.  Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items.  A PIC who accepted an aircraft with degraded equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent operations with the same  degraded  equipment.    PICs  are  not  committed  to  operations  with  degraded  equipment accepted by another PIC. (T-2) 4.2.1.  The  PIC  shall  account  for  the  possibility  of  additional  failures  during  continued operation with inoperative systems or components.  The MEL is not intended for continued operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative. (T-2) 4.2.2.  All  emergency  equipment  will  be  installed  unless  specifically  exempted  by  mission requirements/directives. (T-2) 4.2.3.  Waiver    Policy.    A  PIC  desiring  to  operate  with  a  degraded  item  required  to  be functional by the MEL shall request a waiver IAW paragraph 4.3.  The PIC shall provide: 1) nature  of  request,  2)  individual  crew  member  qualification,  3)  mission  leg(s)  requiring  the waiver,  and  4)  the  governing  directive  of  waiver  request  to  include  volume,  chapter,  or paragraph. (T-2) 4.3.  MEL Waiver Protocol.  MEL waiver authority is as follows: 4.3.1.  Training Missions.  OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority. (T-3) 4.3.2.  Operational Missions.  MAJCOM/A3 with mission execution authority. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   19  4.3.3.  Contingency  Missions.    Director  of  Mobility  Forces  (DIRMOBFOR)  (or  equivalent) for  the  agency  with  C2,  if  not  specified  in  the  Operations  Order  (OPORD)/Tasking  Order. (T-2) 4.3.4.  If beyond C2 communication capability, and when faced with exigent circumstances, the  PIC  may  deviate  from  the  MEL  and  this  chapter.    Report  deviations  (without  waiver) IAW    this  AFI  paragraph  1.4.    NOTE:    When  the  PIC  assumes  waiver  authority  under exigent  circumstances, risk mitigation/management principals to the decision making process. (T-2) the  PIC  shall  exercise  sound judgment  and  apply 4.3.5.  One-time  Flight  Clarification.    Normally  a  Red  X  discrepancy  is  downgraded  for  a one-time  flight.    This  condition  does  not  preclude  carrying  cargo  and  passengers,  unless restricted by the authority who downgraded the Red X.  The priority is to move the airplane to a repair capable facility.  PICs must coordinate with appropriate agencies to ensure repair capability  exists  at  the  destination.    One-time  flights  may  include  en  route  technical  stops only when necessary to recover the airplane. (T-2) 4.4.  Technical  Assistance.  The  PIC  may  request  technical  support  and  additional  assistance from their home unit or MAJCOM A3V. 4.5.  MEL  Procedural  Guidance.  The  Technical  Order  (TO)  1C-12(A/F/J)-1,  Flight  Manual,  provides the C-12 MEL.  The MEL lists aircraft equipment and systems considered essential for safe flight. When the PIC considers an item essential that is not covered by this list, that item will be  treated  as  if  it  is  included.    The  TO  1C-12(A/F/J)-1  MEL  does  not  include  the  Minimum Essential Subsystems List (MESL) which is maintained by the maintenance contractor. 4.5.1.  Warning and Caution annunciator lights not specifically referenced in the MEL should be operative. (T-2) 4.5.2.  Crews  will  refer  to  MAJCOM  or  unit  policy  regarding  engine  exceedance.    In  the absence  of  MAJCOM  or  unit  policy,  land  as  soon  as  practical  when  an  engine  limit exceedance  has  been  encountered.    A  maintenance  supervisor  will  determine  the  course  of action required and the disposition of the aircraft. (T-2) 4.6.  Gear  Down  Flight  Operations.  Limit  gear  down  flight  operations  to  sorties  required  to move  the  aircraft  to  a  suitable  repair  facility.    Consider  gear  down  flight  only  after  the  PIC exhausts all avenues to repair the aircraft in place. (T-2)   20  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 Chapter 5 OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES 5.1.  Checklists.  A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished. Momentary hesitations for coordination items, air traffic control (ATC) interruptions and deviations specified in  the  flight  manual,  etc.,  are  authorized.  Notes  amplifying  checklist  procedures  or  limitations may  be  added  to  the  checklists  (in  pencil  only).  Currency  of  notes  is  a  crewmember’s responsibility. (T-2) 5.1.1.  Checklist Inserts.  MAJCOM Stan/Eval will approve the use of checklist inserts IAW AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP).  The inserts should be placed at the end of the appropriate checklist or in an in- flight guide.  All checklist inserts must have a POC.  Operations  Group  Stan/Eval  (OGV)  shall  approve  local  in-flight  guides  and  inserts  not affecting TO guidance and procedures. (T-2) 5.1.2.  Checklist  Discipline.    The  pilot  flying  (PF)  should  call  for  a  checklist  using  its  full, correct  name  and  the  pilot  not  flying  (PNF)  should  run  the  checklist.    State  the  verbatim checklist response, adding “Copilot” or “Pilot” if a response is required by both pilots.  The PNF should state the correct response first along with “Copilot/Pilot” so the PF knows that a response  is  required.    The  second  responder  states  the  correct  response  followed  by “Pilot/Copilot.”  Example-  after “Flight instruments, CHECKED and SET Copilot” the pilot should  respond  with  ‘CHECKED  and  SET  Pilot.”    If  the  response  is  “STATE  SETTING,” respond  with  the  setting,  (i.e.  “Altimeters  3-0-0-0  Copilot;”  “3-0-0-0  Pilot”).    Settings  or safety checks can be verbalized during a response, but the correct checklist response must be said  before  the  item  is  complete,  (i.e.  “Annunciators,  three  green  and  a  Battery  charge, Checked  Pilot”).    When  only  one  pilot  has  a  response,  it  will  be  verbalized,  but  “Pilot”  or “Copilot”  does  not  have  to  be  stated  (e.g.  PNF  states  “Manual  Prop  Feathering.”  PF accomplishes the checklist step then states “Checked/Full Forward”). (T-2) 5.2.  Duty Station.  Both pilots shall be in their seats during flight.  One of the pilots may be out of their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs and crew duties.  With both pilots in their seats, PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during non-critical  phases  of  flight  (the  other  pilot  will  be  awake  and  alert).    Comply  with  AFI  11-202V3 Controlled Cockpit Rest limitations and associated oxygen requirements. (T-2) 5.3.  Flight  Station  Entry.  Passengers  and  observers  will  not  be  permitted  access  to  primary crew positions. (T-2) 5.4.  Landings  With  Emergency.  A qualified aircraft commander will accomplish the landing during actual emergency conditions unless specific conditions dictate otherwise. (T-2) 5.5.  DV-2    Missions.  DV-2  or  higher  missions  require  an  experienced  aircraft  commander (EAC) certified by the unit commander as highly experienced or certified as an instructor to be the  PIC.    EACs  must  have  200  hours  ‘Primary’  assigned  aircraft  (‘Other’  time  excluded)  after certification as an AC.  A qualified EAC or higher will make all takeoffs and landings on these missions. (T-2) 5.6.  Seatbelts.  All occupants must have an assigned seat with a seatbelt.  Use of seatbelts will be as directed by the PIC and the flight manual. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   21  5.6.1.  Infants, 2 years old or younger, may be carried in the lap of the parent or guardian but must  have  a  separate  seat  assigned.    Separate  flotation  devices  and  oxygen  sources  are required. (T-2) 5.6.2.  All crewmembers will have the lap belt fastened at all times in flight and while taxiing the aircraft, unless crew duties dictate otherwise. (T-2) 5.6.3.  All  crewmembers  will  have  seatbelts  and  shoulder  harnesses  fastened  during  takeoff and landing unless crew duties dictate otherwise. (T-2) 5.6.4.  Litter  patients,  actual  or  simulated,  must  remain  secured  on  litters  for  takeoff  and landing. (T-2) 5.7.  Aircraft  Lighting.  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  AFI  11-218,  Aircraft  Operations  and  Movement on the Ground, and the flight manual. (T-2) 5.8.  Portable Electronic Devices.  IAW AFI 11-202V3. 5.9.  Tobacco  Use  on  Air  Force  Aircraft.  Tobacco  use  of  any  type  is  prohibited  on  C-12 aircraft. (T-2) 5.10.  Advisory Calls.  The PF will periodically announce intentions during departures, arrivals, approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from  normal  procedures.  The PNF will monitor PF actions and maintain situational awareness at all times.  Table 5.1 through Table 5.5 depict  mandatory  calls  for  non-precision  approaches,  precision  approaches,  climbout,  descent, and landing phases respectively. (T-2) Table 5.1.  Non-precision Approaches.

The pilot may not descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation (TDZE) referencing only the approach lights unless the red termination bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.  If the aircraft is not in a position for a normal landing, a go-around will be made.  3)  ‘Runway environment’ is defined in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.  4)  The PNF will announce "100" and "50" at 100 and 50 feet HAT, as indicated on the radar altimeter.  The PNF shall assess aircraft glide path and call "go around" if the sink rate is excessive or the aircraft is on a vector to land short of the runway.  If the aircraft avionics automatically provides the 100 feet and 50 feet callouts, the PNF is not required to voice these calls. AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   23  5.10.1.  Anytime an altitude or altimeter setting is changed when operating in a non-standard configuration, both pilots will verify the units of measure.  Standard configuration is defined as the units of measure the pilots are accustomed to operating with. (T-2) 5.11.  Deviations.  The PNF will announce when heading or airspeed deviations are observed, or when the altitude is more than 100 feet from assigned and the PF is not correcting the deviation.  PF will acknowledge the deviation. (T-2) 5.11.1.  Any  crewmember  observing  an  altitude  more  than  200  feet  from  assigned  or  a decrease of 10 knots airspeed from briefed/desired or a potential terrain/obstruction conflict will immediately notify the PF.  PF will acknowledge the warning. (T-2) 5.12.  Communications  Policy.  The  Air  Force  does  not  give  a  promise  of  confidentiality  to aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications.  Crewmembers are expected to maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times. (T-2) 5.12.1.  Sterile    Cockpit.    Limit  conversation  to  that  essential  for  crew  coordination  and mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and other critical phases of flight. (T-2) 5.12.2.  Command Radios.  The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and update the crew when the primary radio changes. (T-2) 5.12.2.1.  Both  pilots  will  monitor  UHF  and  VHF  guard  emergency  frequencies  to  the maximum extent possible. (T-2) 5.12.2.2.  The  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  prohibits  the  use  of unauthorized  frequencies  for  interplane,  HAVE  QUICK,  or  SECURE  VOICE  training. (T-2) 5.12.3.  Crew    Resource    Management    (CRM)    Assertive    Statement.    "Time  Out"  is  the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use of "Time Out" will: 5.12.3.1.  Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness. (T-2) 5.12.3.2.  Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs. (T-2) 5.12.3.3.  Notify  all  crewmembers  when  someone  sees  the  crew  departing  from established  guidelines,  the  briefed  scenario,  or  that  someone  is  simply  uncomfortable with the developing conditions. (T-2) 5.12.4.  As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the PIC will: 5.12.4.1.  Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft. (T-2) 5.12.4.2.  Allow the initiating crewmember to voice their concerns. (T-2) 5.12.4.3.  The PIC will seek other crewmembers inputs relative to the stated concerns. (T-2) 5.12.4.4.  After considering all inputs, the PIC will announce a course of action. (T-2) 5.12.5.  Transfer of Aircraft Control.  When the PF wishes to transfer control of the aircraft, the    PF  shall  state,  “Pilot’s  [or  Copilot’s]  Aircraft.”    The  PNF  upon  assuming  control acknowledges  “Pilot’s  [or  Copilot’s]  Aircraft.”    The  PF  should  not  relinquish  control  until   24  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 hearing  the  verbal  response  from  the  PNF  and  visually  confirming  the  PNF  is  now  the  PF. (T-2) 5.12.5.1.  If the PIC elects to take control of the aircraft during time-critical or emergency situations, it is imperative that the PF relinquish control immediately on the PICs verbal command  so  as  not  to  obstruct  any  flight  control  or  throttle  movements.    With  the autopilot engaged, the procedure remains the same; however, there is no requirement to take  or  observe  physical  control  of  the  aircraft.    As  necessary,  announce  control  of  the radios with a change in aircraft control (i.e. “Copilot’s aircraft, Pilots radios”). (T-2) 5.12.5.2.  In  the  event  of  intercom  failure  with  oxygen  masks  on,  a  verbal  transfer  may not  be  possible.    To  transfer  aircraft  control,  the  PF  should  pump  the  rudder  pedals  to pass  aircraft  control.    The  pilot  assuming  control  should  acknowledge  by  shaking  the yoke.    The  pilot  transferring  controls  holds  up  his/her  hands  to  indicate  control  is relinquished.  This non-verbal transfer is commonly referred to as, “Pump to pass, shake to take.” (T-2) 5.12.6.  Critical  /  Irreversible  Actions.    Critical/irreversible  actions  should  always  be confirmed by both pilots.  These include, but are not limited to: pulling a fire handle, placing a  condition  lever  to  CUTOFF,  moving  a  propeller  lever  to  FEATHER,  discharging  a  fire extinguisher,  and  turning  off  a  generator.    Unless  a  checklist  item  is  specific  to  a  crew position  (i.e.  ELT  –  ON  (P))  or  the  location  of  the  switch  is  only  accessible  by  one  crew position, the PNF will normally perform all engine shutdown actions.  The pilot performing the  action  will  point  to  the  affected  switch/handle  and  verbally  seek  confirmation  from  the other  crewmember  (i.e.  “Confirm  left”).    The  pilot  confirming  the  action  will  look  at  the affected  switch/handle  and  verbally  acknowledge  that  the  correct  switch/handle  has  been selected.  These procedures do not apply to engine shutdown procedures on the ground. (T-2) 5.13.  Transportation  of  Pets.  Transporting  dogs  and  cats  in  conjunction  with  the  sponsor’s permanent  change  of  station  is  authorized.    Refer  to  DoD  4515.13R  for  rules  governing  the transporting of other pets. (T-2) 5.14.  Alcoholic  Beverages.  Dispensing  of  alcoholic  beverages  is  IAW  AFI  34-219,  Alcoholic Beverage Program. 5.15.  Runway,  Taxiway,  and  Airfield  Requirements.  Minimum  normal  operating requirements  are  listed  in  this  paragraph.    Operating  at  airfields  not  meeting  these  normal minimal  requirements  require  specific  OG/CC  approval  plus  additional  risk  mitigation  in  the form  of  specialized  pilot  training  and  certification.    See  paragraph  5.17.  for  short  field/austere field operations. (T-2) 5.15.1.  Minimum Runway Length For Takeoff and Landings.  Crews will determine aircraft takeoff and landing data (TOLD) performance from the flight manual or MAJCOM approved tab  data.    Field  length  available  must  exceed  the  longest  of  computed  Accelerate-Go[J]/Accelerate  After  Lift-off[C/D/F]  computed  over  35  foot  obstacle,    Accelerate-Stop computed  without  reverse  corrected  for  RCR  plus  500  feet,  or  landing  distance  computed without reverse over a 50 foot obstacle corrected for RCR plus 500 feet. (T-2) 5.15.1.1.  Intersection  Takeoffs.    Normally,  the  PF  will  initiate  takeoffs  from  the beginning  of  the  approved  usable  portion  of  the  runway.    The  decision  to  make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.  Runway remaining from the intersection AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   25  will  be  as  required  in  paragraphs  5.15.1.    Pilots  may  accomplish  intersection  takeoffs provided  the  operating  environment  (i.e.,  gross  weight,  obstructions,  climb  criteria, weather, etc.) allows a safe takeoff and departure.  Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway remaining from the point at which the takeoff is initiated. (T-2) 5.15.1.2.  Minimum runway length for touch-and-go landings is 5,000 feet [1,524 meters] for C/D/F models and 6,000 feet [1,830 meters] for J models. (T-2) 5.15.1.3.  Normal  operations  require  runway,  taxiway,  and  parking  ramp  to  be constructed of asphalt or concrete. (T-2) 5.15.2.  During  operations  on  runways  partially  covered  with  snow  or  ice,  base  takeoff computations  on  the  reported  Runway  Surface  Condition  (RSC)  or  RCR  for  the  cleared portion of the runway.  A minimum of 25 feet either side of centerline should be cleared.  If 25 feet either side of centerline is not cleared, compute takeoff data based on the uncleared portion. (T-2) 5.15.3.  Use  of  Overruns.    If  overruns  are  available,  properly  stressed,  and  authorized  for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff or landing. (T-2) 5.15.4.  Minimum Runway Width.  Minimum runway width is 75 feet. (T-2) 5.15.5.  Arresting  Cables.    Land  beyond  the  approach  end  arresting  cable(s)  unless  runway length is critical. (T-2) 5.15.5.1.  Do  not  takeoff  or  land  over  a  cable  that  has  been  reported  as  slack,  loose,  or improperly rigged. (T-2) 5.15.5.2.  The  PIC  is  authorized  to  use  the  entire  length  of  the  runway  if  conditions (aircraft gross weight, runway length, weather, winds, takeoff and landing data (TOLD), etc.)  preclude  taxiing  forward  of  the  approach  end  cable.    The  PIC  will  be  aware  that operations  over  arresting  gear  cables  at  speeds  greater  than  taxi  speed  may  result  in damage  to  the  brake  assembly.    NOTE:    If  an  aircraft  rolls  over  an  arresting  cable  at greater  than  taxi  speed  the  crew  will  make  an  AFTO  781A  write-up  requesting maintenance inspection of brake assembly. (T-2) 5.15.6.  Airfield suitability.  Aircrews should use all available resources to obtain information on  airfields  intended  for  use  as  a  destination  or  alternate.    When  transiting  unfamiliar airfields, aircrews will review AMC’s Airfield Suitability Restrictions Report (ASRR).  The ASRR  is  not  restrictive  to  the  C-12  except  for  compliance  with  all  airfield  certification restriction  requirements  and  MAJCOM  TERPs  issued  approach  restrictions,  unless specifically  exempted  by  MAJCOM/A3.  Waiver  authority  for  these  restrictions  will  be  as listed in the ASRR, or will be the OG/CC if not specified. (T-2) 5.15.7.  RCR Limitations.  If a value is not reported, use RCR 12 for wet runways and RCR 6 for icy  runways.  Conversions from  other braking  action standards to  RCR should be  IAW DoD  FLIP  documents.    Normally,  RCR  values  are  not  reported  for  taxiways  and  ramps. During periods of reported low RCR, the taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR than reported for the runway.  The runway surface should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a reflective glare. (T-2)   26  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 5.15.7.1.  Do  not  use  runways/taxiways  with  a  reported  RCR  value  less  than  6. EXCEPTION:  OG/CC  may  authorize  crews  to  taxi  on  taxiways  with  a  reported  RCR value of 3 or greater. (T-2) 5.15.8.  Wind  Limitations.    Airfields  will  be  considered  below  minimums  for  takeoff  and landing when winds (including gusts) are greater than: 5.15.8.1.  Maximum wind (any direction) – 50 knots. (T-2) 5.15.8.2.  Maximum tailwind component – 10 knots. (T-2) 5.15.8.3.  Maximum crosswinds – reference Table 5.6 (T-2) Table 5.6.  C-12 Takeoff and Landing Crosswind Components. RCR Values Maximum Crosswind Component for Takeoff and landing 6 10 7 12 8 15 9 10 17  20 11 22 12 and above 25 5.16.  Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Avoidance. 5.16.1.  Taxi distance from obstructions is IAW AFI 11-218 and MAJCOM supplements. (T-2) 5.16.2.  Foreign  Object  Damage  (FOD)  Avoidance.    Make  every  effort  to  minimize  the potential  for  engine  FOD.    Crews  will  carefully  review  taxi  routes,  turn  requirements,  and areas for potential FOD. (T-2) 5.16.3.  Reverse  Taxi.    The  aircraft  may  be  backed,  using  reverse,  when  no  other  means  of moving  the  aircraft  is  available  or  when  required  for  familiarization  during  qualification training.  This  procedure  will  not  be  used  at  any  time  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  delays when  towing  equipment  is  available  or  when  other  aircraft  or  equipment  can  be  moved  to provide  adequate  taxi  clearance.    Pilots  must  exercise  extreme  caution  during  reverse  taxi operations.  Ensure a marshaller is present for all reverse taxi operations.  CAUTION:  Prop Blast during ground operations is capable of causing injury to ground personnel and damage to other aircraft, flight line equipment, and airport facilities. (T-2) 5.17.  Short  Field/Austere  Field  Operations.  Airfields that do not meet the minimum normal operating requirements (as delineated in paragraph 5.15) require OG/CC approval prior to first-time use.  Unit or Group stan/eval office will maintain a list of short/austere airfields approved for  local  use.    Units  conducting  short  field/austere  field  operations  shall  comply  with  the following: (T-2) 5.17.1.  A  specially  trained  and  unit  commander  certified  pilot  will  make  all  takeoffs  and landings from runways not meeting minimum normal runway requirements. (T-2) 5.17.2.  Operations are limited to daytime. (T-2) 5.17.3.  Minimum  runway  length  for  takeoff  is  the  computed  takeoff  distance  (including climb to 50 feet) plus 500 feet.  WARNING:  Mission Execution Authority shall be aware of the  elevated  risk  associated  with  short  field/austere  field  operations.    Approving  crews  to utilize  short  field/austere  field  procedures  authorizes  crews  to  conduct  operations  with  less than critical field length performance (Category III operations). (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   27  5.17.4.  Minimum landing distance will be computed ground roll corrected for RCR without reverse plus 500 feet. (T-2) 5.17.5.  Minimum  runway  width.    Minimum  runway  width  for  short  field/austere  field operations is 50 feet. (T-2) 5.17.6.  If  a  significant  change  occurs to  an  approved  airfield  environment  (i.e. runway/taxiway  reduction,  clearway  encroachment,  field  damage/disrepair,  etc.  ),  OG/CC must re-certify approval. (T-2) 5.18.  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Programs.  BASH  programs  are centralized  unit  efforts  IAW  AFI  91-202  The  US  Air  Force  Mishap  Prevention  Program  that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a consolidated course of action.  As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following procedures: (T-2) 5.18.1.  Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions. 5.18.1.1.  Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions. 5.18.1.2.  Bird  Watch  Condition  Moderate  -  Takeoffs  and  landings  allowed  only  when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity.  Local Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic pattern activity is prohibited. 5.18.1.3.  Bird  Watch  Condition  Severe  -  All  takeoffs  and  landings  are  prohibited.  Waiver  authority  is  OG/CC.    Bird  Condition  Severe  is  defined  as  “bird  activity  on  or immediately  above  the  active  runway  or  other  specific  location  representing  high potential for strikes.”  When bird activity meets this definition, crews should consider the bird  condition  as  Severe  regardless  of  what  condition  the  airfield  is  reporting.    Any unreported  bird  hazards  should  be  reported  to  ATC  as  soon  as  practicable.    NOTE: MCAS fields (i.e. Iwakuni) use the term “Heavy” instead of severe. 5.18.2.  OG/CCs  establish  Phase  II  of  the  BASH  program  during  increased  periods  of migratory  bird  activity.    Schedulers  shall  make  every  effort  to  not  schedule  takeoffs  or landings from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the Phase II period. (T-2) 5.18.3.  When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, PICs have the authority to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to observed/reported bird activity. (T-2) 5.18.4.  Consider  bird  migratory  patterns  during  the  en  route  portion  of  the  mission  to  help minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike.  The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ AFSC/SEF  website  contains  BASH  information  including  regionalized  Contiguous  United States  (CONUS)  bird  migration  patterns,  Portable  Flight  Planning  System  (PFPS)  software overlay, and the latest news.  The Avian Hazard Advisory system (AHAS) website is another source  for  real    time  bird  hazard  information.    See  AFPAM  91-212,  Bird  Aircraft  Strike Hazard  (BASH)  Management  Techniques,  for  additional  information.    The  information derived from BASH computer models, although not restrictive, provides additional planning information and is useful when determining transition or low altitude training locations. (T-2) 5.18.5.  Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit to have the aircraft  inspected  by  qualified  maintenance  personnel.    Bird  strike  damage  cannot  be accurately  assessed  in-flight,  and  undetected  damage  may  result  in  a  complex  airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can make reliable damage   28  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 assessments.    Aircrews  should  not  change  the  aircraft  configuration  until  it  has  been determined  that  it  is  safe  to  do  so.    However,  PIC  judgment  will  prevail  in  any  situation concerning safety of the aircrew and aircraft. (T-2) 5.19.  Functional  Check  Flights  (FCFs)  and  Acceptance  Check    Flights  (ACFs).  Perform FCFs and ACFs IAW TO 1-1-300, Acceptance/Functional Check Flight and Maintenance OPR Checks, specific MDS FCF guidance (-6CF), AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management,  and  applicable  MAJCOM  directives.    Crews  should  only  perform  tasks  or functions  contained  in  specific  TO  guidance.    If  requested  to  perform  a  non-standard  function, PICs should contact their Ops Group Stan Eval representative to see if an FCF applies. (T-2) 5.19.1.  FCFs  are  performed  after  accomplishing  inspections  or  maintenance  to  assure  the aircraft is airworthy and capable of mission accomplishment. 5.19.2.  ACFs specify guidelines for accepting depot aircraft and determine compliance with contractual requirements. 5.19.3.  FCF Restrictions.  IAW TO 1-1-300. (T-2) 5.19.4.  The OG/CC is responsible for the FCF program.  The OG/CC may authorize a partial FCF to check only those systems affected by maintenance, an inspection or modification. (T-3) 5.19.5.  In  accordance  with  TO  1C-12(A/F/J)-6CF-1,  Functional  Check  Flight  Procedures, conditions  requiring  an  FCF  include  (but  are  not  limited  to)  major  retrofit  modifications, removal or replacement of moveable flight control surfaces, major repairs that would affect the  flying  characteristics  of  the  aircraft,  adjustment,  removal  or  replacement  of  major components  of  the  flight  control  system  for  which  airworthiness  cannot  be  verified  by maintenance operational checks, or removal or replacement of both engines. 5.19.6.  The approval authority to combine an FCF and ferry flight is the MAJCOM/A3. (T-2) 5.20.  Participation  in  Aerial  Events.  See  AFI  11-209,  Aerial  Event  Policy  and  Procedures, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.  AFI 11-209 identifies events sanctioned for support, specifies  the  approval  authority  for  each  type,  and  stipulates  that  units  participating  in  aerial events  will  ensure  activities  are  coordinated  with  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA) through the regional AF representative. (T-2) 5.21.  Traffic Alert and Collision System (TCAS).  TCAS operations shall be IAW AFI 11-202 V3. (T-2) 5.22.  Aircraft  Recovery  from  Unprepared  Surfaces.  Aircrews  will  not  normally  attempt  to recover  an  aircraft  after  inadvertent  entry  onto  unprepared  surfaces  not  suitable  for  taxi.    A qualified ground crew will accomplish aircraft recovery.  The PIC may only accomplish recovery under exigent  circumstance, if there is  no aircraft  damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and the PIC has coordinated with appropriate authorities. (T-2) 5.23.  Electronic  Flight  Instrument  System.  The  Universal  Avionics  Systems  Corporations UNS-1  Flight  Management  System  (FMS)  and  EFI-890R  Primary  Flight  Display  (PFD)  and Navigation Display (ND) require a thorough systems understanding and clear cockpit “standard” calls to ensure safe operations. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   29  5.23.1.  General.  Crewmembers will understand the operation and limitations of automation and be proficient at operating the aircraft in all levels of automation.  The level of automation used at any specific time should be the most appropriate to reduce crew workload, increase situational awareness, and enhance mission effectiveness and safety. (T-2) 5.23.1.1.  One  pilot  shall  always  maintain  a  scan  of  aircraft  instruments  as  well  as  a clearing  scan  when  in  VMC.    When  a  pilot  accesses  equipment  located  on  the  center pedestal,  that  pilot  should  announce  “heads  down”  or  “inside”  when  the  task  requires focusing significant attention/time. (T-2) 5.23.1.2.  Task  saturation.    Avoid  extensive  reprogramming  of  the  FMS  during  critical phases of flight or during periods of high workload. (T-2) 5.23.1.3.  Pilots  will  back  each  other  up  when  making  changes  to  the  flight  director  or FMS.  The pilot not programming the FMS should confirm the other pilots programming.  Always  back  up  automation  with  basic  navigational  instrumentation  and  charts,  when available. (T-2) 5.23.1.4.  If  aircraft  automation  is  not  performing  as  expected,  the  pilot  flying  should revert to lower levels of automation (or manual flight as necessary) before attempting to resolve system problems. (T-2) 5.23.2.  EFIS Settings. 5.23.2.1.  Takeoff.  Normally set V1 and V2.  VTGT and/or the manual speed bug may be set to the climb schedule speed or other relevant briefed speed (i.e. VYSE). (T-3) 5.23.2.2.  Approach.  Normally set VREF as the TO directed VAPP speed.  VTGT and or the manual speed bug may be unset or set per pilot preference (i.e. min speed on final). (T-3) 5.23.2.3.  Altitude  Alerter.    The  PF  will  determine  how  the  altitude  alerter  is  set  but consideration  should  be  given  to  setting  the  ATC  assigned  altitude.    For  an  instrument approach  normally  set  either the  missed approach/climbout altitude in the alerter. (T-3) the  approach  DA  (rounded  up)  or 5.23.2.4.  Heading bug.  The PF will determine how the heading bug is set.  The standard is to maintain a meaningful bugged heading. (T-3) 5.23.2.5.  Radio Altitude/Decision Altitude. 5.23.2.5.1.  Before departure, set the RA/DA.  For operational missions, normally set for intended approach to be used for emergency return.  For training sorties, normally set for first intended instrument approach.  For VFR operations, set as desired. (T-3) 5.23.2.5.2.  For  instrument  approaches,  set  for  the  appropriate  minimums.    NOTE:  The C-12 is not Cat II/III certified.  Therefore, use only DA altitudes for approaches. (T-3) 5.23.3.  Standard  Auto  Flight  Control  System  (AFCS)  and  Flight  Management  System (FMS) Procedures and Verbiage.  When the PF is directing the PNF to make AFCS inputs, clarity is of the utmost importance.  Standard verbiage aids clarity and brevity and enhances situational awareness.  The following provides operational standards but does not supersede   30  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 the judgment of the PIC.  Whenever a pilot is unsure of the command he/she will query the other pilot for clarification. (T-2) 5.23.3.1.  Mode  awareness.    In  both  manual  and  automated  flight,  both  pilots  should verify and acknowledge all changes to the Flight Mode Annunciators (FMA). (T-2) 5.23.3.2.  Autopilot  and  yaw  damper.    Should  the  PF  desire  to  engage  the  autopilot  or yaw  damper,  the  PF  should  direct  the  PNF  to  engage  the  desired  system(s).    After  the autopilot is engaged, the PNF is referred to as the pilot monitoring (PM), in accordance with  flying  industry  standards.    Disengagement  of  the  autopilot  or  yaw  damper  should always be announced. (T-2) 5.23.3.3.  Manual Flight.  Manual flight refers to flight without the autopilot on, with or without  the  use  of  the  flight  director.    During  manual  flight,  the  PF  should  normally direct the PNF to make all changes to the flight director as well as altitude alerter, speed bug,  speed  markers,  and  heading  bug.    Refer  to  Table  5.7  for  standardized  verbiage during manual flight. (T-2) 5.23.3.4.  Automated  Flight.    With  the  autopilot  engaged,  the  PF  normally  makes  all changes to the flight director, bugs, and markers.  Even so, the PF may direct the PM to make  changes  as  necessary.    Refer  to  table  5.8  for  standardized  verbiage  during automated flight. (T-2) 5.23.3.5.  Terminology.  Refer to Table 5.7 and Table 5.8 for all standardized verbiage.  Use the word “ENGAGE” for the autopilot/yaw damper.   Use the word  “SELECT” for flight director changes such as HDG, APPR, or CLIMB modes.  Use the word “SET” for all  bug  and  marker  changes  such  as  heading,  airspeed,  or  altitude  change.    Using “Engage”,  “Select”,  or  “Set”  first  is  directive  (SET  Hdg  180),  while  using  “Engaged”, “Selected”,  or  “Set”  last  for  confirmation  (Hdg  180  SET).    State  “ARMED”  after selecting and confirming a Flight Control Panel (FCP) input such as LOC or GS. (T-2) 5.23.3.6.  Route modification.  It is critically important to verify that correct data is input before allowing aircraft automation to perform a function.  Regardless of who initiates a change to the lateral or vertical flight plan, the other pilot should verify and acknowledge the change.  Both pilots should monitor the aircraft for the appropriate response. (T-2) 5.23.3.7.  Vision 1.  For aircraft equipped with Vision 1, crews may display Vision 1 on the pilot’s Primary Flight Display (PFD) only during day, VMC conditions for situational awareness/orientation only.

Certification/Special  Airfield.  Airfields  designated  as  Certification  or  Special  fields  by MAJCOMs, FAA, ASRR, or other appropriate authority require additional risk mitigation.  Unit commanders must certify/approve PIC’s to operate at these airfields.  Aircrews will thoroughly review  all  available  airfield  and  approach/departure  information  prior  to  operating  at  these airfields.    Unfamiliar/unqualified  PIC  shall  receive  at  a  minimum  a  table  top  briefing  by qualified instructor pilot.  Unqualified/unfamiliar PIC requires OG/CC approval prior to using a Certification/Special airfield. (T-2) 6.6.  Aircrew  Intelligence  Briefing.

Departure  Planning.  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  AFMAN  11-217V1,  this  chapter,  and appropriate  MAJCOM  supplements.    Compute  TOLD  using  TO1C-12(A/F/J)-1,  TO  1C-12(A/F/J)-1CL-1,  and/or  OGV-approved  performance  data  extracts.    All  TOLD  computations should be verified by both pilots. (T-2) 6.15.1.  Refer  to  FLIP  for  host  nation  VFR  requirements  before  flying  VFR  outside  the United States. (T-2) 6.15.1.1.  When  departing  VFR,  maintain  VFR  cloud  clearances  until  obtaining  an  IFR clearance. (T-2)   36  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 6.15.2.  IFR Departures.  Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1. (T-2) 6.16.  Weather Minimums for Takeoff.  Minimum Runway Visual Range (RVR) for takeoff is 1600 feet.  If RVR is not available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to be 1/2 mile  (800  meters).    When  weather  is  below  approach  and  landing  minimums  (ceiling  or visibility) a departure alternate is required (See paragraph 6.18). (T-2) 6.17.  Alternate Planning.  Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.  Select  alternates  that  are  not  restricted  by  FLIP,  FCG,  or  diplomatic  clearances,  and  are compatible  with  the  mission  load,  wind  limits  and  performance  characteristics  of  the  aircraft.  Alternates selected by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the above criteria.  The PIC retains final authority in the choice of alternates. (T-2) 6.18.  Departure Alternates. 6.18.1.  A  departure  alternate  is  required  if  weather  (ceiling  or  visibility)  is  below  landing minimums for the available approach (at departure aerodrome). (T-2) 6.18.2.  Suitability  of  Departure  Alternates.    When  a  departure  alternate  is  required,  the aircraft must be capable of maintaining the minimum en-route altitude (MEA) or minimum obstruction  clearance  altitude  (MOCA),  whichever  is  higher,  to  the  alternate  using  one engine  inoperative  (OEI)  performance  criteria.    To  qualify  as  a  departure  alternate,  the airfield must meet one of the following conditions: 6.18.2.1.  For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time.  The existing weather must be equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1 hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400). (T-2) 6.18.2.2.  For  an  alternate  between  31  minutes  to  1  hour  flying  time.    The  existing weather  must  be  at  least  500-1  above  the  lowest  compatible  published  approach minimums, but not less than 600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for 1 hour after estimated time of arrival (ETA) at the alternate. (T-2) 6.18.2.3.  OG/CC may approve the use of an  alternate up to  2 hours away on a case by case basis.  Comply with weather/approach requirements of para 6.18.2.2. (T-2) 6.19.  Destination  Requirements  (for  filing  purposes).  The  forecast  destination  weather  will be according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following: 6.19.1.  File two alternates when: 6.19.1.1.  The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the available DoD or Aeronautical Navigation (AeroNav) precision approach; or, (T-2) 6.19.1.2.  The  forecast  ceiling  OR  visibility  (intermittent  or  prevailing)  is  less  than published  for  all  non-precision  DoD/National  Geospacial  Agency  (NGA)/AeroNav approaches.    For  approaches  with  no  published  ceiling  requirement  (for  example Jeppesen  approaches),  the  minimum  required  ceiling  shall  be  computed  by  taking  the published  HAA  or  HAT  and  rounding  it  up  to  the  nearest  one  hundred  feet  (or  as determined  by  MAJCOM  terminal  instrument  procedures  (TERPS)  review).    For AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   37  example, a Jeppesen VOR approach with a published HAA of 642 feet  would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet; or, (T-2) 6.19.1.3.  The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected for RCR. (T-2) 6.19.2.  File  an  alternate,  regardless  of  forecast  weather,  when  the  destination  aerodrome  is outside the CONUS. (T-2) 6.19.3.  When  filing  to  a  remote  or  island  destination,  follow  MAJCOM  guidance.    In absence of MAJCOM guidance, aircrews may use 1+15 holding fuel (in lieu of an alternate).  Compute  holding  fuel  using  planned  destination  gross  weight  and  cruise  altitude  or  an altitude  that  minimizes  fuel  burn.    A  remote  or  island  destination  is  defined  as  any aerodrome, which due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time.  The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria: 6.19.3.1.  The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter. (T-2) 6.19.3.2.  The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours.  However, if a precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non- precision    approach    minimums  (excluding  airport  surveillance  radar  (ASR)),  but  not below  precision  approach  minimums  (for  ETA  plus  2  hours).    (T-2)      NOTE:    Most weather forecasts are only valid plus or minus 1 hour from estimated time of arrival. 6.20.  Adverse Weather. 6.20.1.  Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited. (T-2) 6.20.1.1.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  all  passengers  are  seated,  with  seat  belts fastened,  when  areas  of  moderate  or  greater  turbulence  are  encountered  or  anticipated.  (T-2)   WARNING:  Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence. 6.20.2.  Flight  into  areas  of  forecast  or  reported  severe  icing  is  prohibited.    Prolonged operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.  (T-2)   NOTE:  Air Force Weather Agency technical note (AFWA/TN) 98/002, Meteorological Techniques,  states  that  freezing  drizzle  is  equivalent  to  moderate  icing  and  freezing  rain  is equivalent to severe icing. When freezing fog is forecast or reported, aircrews should confirm with the local weather agency what type (if any) icing is associated with the freezing fog. 6.20.2.1.  Do  not  takeoff  under  conditions  of  freezing  rain.    Do  not  takeoff  under conditions  of  freezing  drizzle  except  when  aircraft  has  been  properly  de-iced/anti-iced IAW flight manual procedures. (T-2) 6.20.2.2.  Freezing  precipitation,  snow,  freezing  fog,  or  temperatures  below  0°C,  may cause  ice  or  frost  to  accumulate  on  aircraft  surface.    When  an  aircraft  requires  de- icing/anti-icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following: 6.20.2.2.1.  Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluid types (i.e. I, II, IV) listed in  their  respective  flight  manual.    Aircrews  will  be  familiar  with,  and  follow  all   38  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 restrictions  in  their  associated  flight  manual  with  respect  to  anti-ice/de-ice procedures. (T-2) 6.20.2.2.2.  MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti- icing  benefit,  and  therefore  do  not  have  holdover  times.    As  a  guide,  for  approved anti- icing fluids, crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-2, Aircraft  Anti-icing  Procedures,  and  Air  Force Flight  Standards Agency  (AFFSA) published  holdover  tables.    The  holdover  time  begins  when  anti-icing  fluid  is  first applied and the PIC shall use time, temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine when times are exceeded and re-apply fluid if required. (T-2) 6.20.2.2.3.  In  all  cases,  PICs  will  ensure  a  visual  inspection  of  the  aircraft  is completed within 5 minutes prior to departure,  and the aircraft is  clear of  snow  and ice. (T-2) 6.20.3.  Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds. If  unable  to  vertically  clear  thunderstorms  or  cumulonimbus  clouds  by  at  least  2000  feet, avoid them by at least: 6.20.3.1.  20 NMs at or above FL230. (T-2) 6.20.3.2.  10 NMs below FL230. (T-2) 6.20.3.3.  5 NMs for tactical low-level operations below FL230 provided the outside air temperature is at or above 0°C at flight altitude.  Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly moving thunderstorm.  (T-2)    CAUTION:  Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or more from any thunderstorm.  Aircrews must familiarize themselves with information on  thunderstorm  development  and  hazards.    Refer  to  AFH  11-203,  Volumes  1  and  2, Weather for Aircrews. 6.20.4.  The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be used  to  assist  in  departing  an  inadvertently  penetrated  area  of  significant  weather.    When relying exclusively on ground-based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC. (T-2) 6.20.5.  Aircrews  should  avoid  flying  in  areas  of  recently  dissipated  thunderstorms  and advected  clouds  (horizontal  movement  of  clouds  caused  by  wind)  downwind  of thunderstorms. (T-2) 6.20.6.  In  order  to  minimize  exposure  to  thunderstorm  hazards  when  approaching  or departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast: 6.20.6.1.  Attempt to maintain VMC. (T-2) 6.20.6.2.  Maintain at least 5 NMs separation from heavy rain showers. (T-2) 6.20.6.3.  Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e. clouds within plus or minus 5,000 feet  of the freezing level  or plus  or minus 8°C of the freezing  level.    (T-2)        NOTE:  Approaches or departures may be  accomplished when thunderstorms are  within 10NMs providing they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds,  gusts  fronts,  heavy  rain,  wind  shear,  or  microburst)  at  the  airport,  and  are  not forecast  or  observed  to  be  moving  in  the  direction  of  the  route  of  flight  (to  include  the planned missed approach corridor, if applicable). AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   39  6.20.7.  When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C or below, refer to the FIH Section D, Temperature Correction Chart, and/or  AFI 11-202V3 Temperature Correction paragraph, to ensure adequate obstacle clearance. (T-2) 6.20.8.  Do  not  fly  into  an  area  of  known  or  forecast  moderate  or  greater  mountain  wave turbulence. (T-2) 6.20.8.1.  Mountain  wave  turbulence  is  normally  a  predictable  condition.    Military weather  forecasters  can  advise  crews  of  the  potential  for  encountering  mountain  wave turbulence.    However,  weather  data  availability  in  mountainous  regions  and  forecast model limitations prevent  the prediction  of all  events.   Crews must be familiar with  the causes of mountain wave turbulence and the characteristic clouds that generally forewarn its presence. (T-2) 6.20.9.  Volcanic Dust Precautions.  If flight into an area of volcanic ash is suspected, crews will use all available resources to determine the level of the hazard.  If flight is planned in an area of volcanic activity, users must comply with restrictions contained in the flight manual.  If flight manual does not specifically permit flight into areas affected by volcanic ash, aircraft operations in areas of forecast or known volcanic activity or dust are prohibited. (T-2) 6.20.10.  Lightning  Avoidance.    The  following  conditions  are  most  conducive  to  lightning strikes and prolonged flight in them should be avoided: 6.20.10.1.  Within 8°C of freezing. (T-2) 6.20.10.2.  In  clouds  or  in  any  intensity  of  precipitation  or  turbulence  associated  with thunderstorm activity. (T-2) 6.21.  Operational Risk Management (ORM).  ORM is a logic based, common sense approach to  making  calculated  decisions  on  human,  material,  and  environmental  factors  before,  during, and after all operations.  USAF policy on ORM is contained in AFI 90-802, Risk Management.  PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets  IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as part of preflight activities. (T-2) Section 6C—Preflight 6.22.  Air  Force Technical Order  Forms  781 Series.  Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying  power  to  the  aircraft  or  operating  aircraft  systems.    An  exceptional  release  must  be signed before flight.  A maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional release.  If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign  the  exceptional  release.    Ensure  that  the  DD  Form  1896,  DoD  Fuel  Identaplate,  and Aviation Into-Plane Reimbursement Card (AIR CARD) are aboard the aircraft. (T-2)    NOTE: Defense Logistics Agency is phasing out the DD Form 1896.  The card may not be available to carry aboard the aircraft. 6.23.  One-Time Flights.  An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another station.  Refer  to  TO  00-20-1,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance  Inspection,  Documentation, Policies,    and    Procedures,  for  downgrade  authority  and  procedures.    After  the  maintenance release  is  obtained,  coordinate  mission  requirements  with  the  controlling  agency.    The  PICs concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown. (T-2)   40  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 6.24.  Aircraft  Recovery  Away  from  Main  Operating  Base  (MOB).  The  PIC  is  responsible for ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings.  If qualified maintenance specialists are unavailable, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet subsequent mission  taskings  using  procudures  delineated  in  Chapter  12,  Aircrew  Maintenance  Support Procedures. (T-2) 6.24.1.  In those instances where maintenance personnel are not available and crew members are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections, the PIC will enter a red dash symbol  in  the  AFTO  Form  781H,  Aerospace  Vehicle  Flight  Status  and  Maintenance Document,  updating  current  status  and  enter  a  red  dash  symbol  and  a  discrepancy  that reflects  that  the  applicable  maintenance  inspection  (i.e.  preflight,  thru-flight,  basic  post- flight) is overdue. (T-2) 6.25.  Life Support Requirements. 6.25.1.  Oxygen.  Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned flight from the equal time point (ETP) to recovery should oxygen be required. (T-2) 6.25.1.1.  All C-12 aircraft should have two [pilots] emergency escape breathing devices  (EEBD) or protective breathing equipment (PBE) on the aircraft. (T-2) 6.25.1.2.  On  flights  carrying  passengers,  one  Emergency  Passenger  Oxygen  System (EPOS)  should  be  available  for  each  passenger.    EPOSs  will  be  distributed  near  each passenger seat and their use demonstrated before departure.  (T-2)    NOTE:  The EPOS is  not  a  substitute  for  the  required  aircraft’s  emergency  passenger  supplemental  oxygen system  used  in  the  event  of  cabin  depressurization  (above  10,000  feet)  but  rather  as  a temporary  measure toxic  environment (smoke/fumes). to  provide  oxygen to  passengers in  a 6.25.1.3.  Crewmembers  occupying  a  crew  station  will  have  an  oxygen  mask  connected and readily available for use from engine start until engine shutdown. (T-2) 6.25.2.  Rafts.    On  overwater  flights,  carry  a  life  raft  when  the  distance  from  land  at  the planned cruising altitude exceeds a glide ratio of approximately 2 miles per 1000 feet (12:1 glide ratio).  For example, if planned cruising altitude is FL240, a life raft would be required if flying more than 48 miles from land. (T-2) 6.25.3.  Life  preserver  units  (LPUs)  or  Personal  Floatation  Device  (PFD).    An  aircrew member  will  ensure  an  LPU  or  PFD  is  within  easy  reach  of  each  passenger  and  aircrew member  before  takeoff  on  overwater  flights  (outside  gliding  distance  to  land).    Ensure  the appropriate  number  and  type  of  life  preservers  are  aboard  for  overwater  missions  carrying children and infants. (T-2) 6.26.  Passenger Handling and Cargo Documentation.  Refer to Chapter 13. 6.27.  Airlifting  Hazardous  Cargo.  For  additional  information  regarding  hazardous  materials, refer to AFMAN 24-204. 6.27.1.  Flight Planning.  The PIC will: 6.27.1.1.  Enter  "Hazardous  Cargo"  and  the  mission  identifier  or  flight  number  in  the appropriate  section  of  the  flight  plan.    Use  Remarks  section  of  DD175,  Military  Flight Plan, and Other Information section of DD1801, International Flight Plan.  Refer to the AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   41  FCG  for  country  specific  requirements  concerning  over-flight  when  transporting hazardous materials cargo. (T-2) 6.27.1.2.  If  possible,  plan  the  flight  to  minimize  overflying  heavily  populated  or otherwise critical areas.  Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded. (T-2) 6.27.1.3.  Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available.  The remarks section of the departure message will include:  Class of hazardous material, DoD class  or  division  for  explosives,  net  explosive  weight  (NEW),  and  gross  weight.    If required, request special handling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams, etc.). (T-2) 6.27.1.4.  If estimated time en route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, notify the next destination of  the  ETA  prior  to  departure.    If  available,  C2  will  relay  required  information  to  next destination. (T-2) 6.27.2.  C-12 aircraft are authorized to transport the following hazardous materials prepared and packaged IAW AFMAN 24-204: 6.27.2.1.  All Class/Divisions of explosives. 6.27.2.2.

(T-2) 6.29.  Life or Death Urgency Shipments.  Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt.  Shipments  will  be  manifested  separately  and  the  manifest  annotated  with  the  words  LIFE  OR DEATH URGENCY.  All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis.  The PIC will be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and be made the custodian during flight. (T-2) Section 6D—Departure AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   43  6.30.  On  Time  Takeoffs.  Mission  departures  are  on  time  if  the  aircraft  is  airborne  within  - 20/+14 minutes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement. (T-2) Section 6E—En route 6.31.  Flight  Progress.  In-flight,  use  all  available  navigational  aids  to  monitor  the  flight management  system  (FMS)  performance.    Immediately  report  malfunctions  or  any  loss  of navigation capability that degrades navigation accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control center (ARTCC). (T-2) 6.32.  Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  Airspace.  Airspace where RVSM is applied is  considered special qualification airspace.   Both  the operator and the aircraft must be certified for operations in this airspace. The C-12 is not currently certified for RVSM airspace. 6.33.  Communications  Instructions  for  Reporting  Vital  Intelligence  Sightings  (CIRVIS) and  Other  Reports.  Report  all  vital  intelligence  sightings  from  aircraft  as  indicated  in  FLIP planning or FLIP En route Supplement. (T-2) 6.33.1.  In-flight  harassment  or  hostile  action  against  aircraft.    Aircraft  subjected  to harassment  or  hostile  action  by  foreign  aircraft  will  immediately  contact  the  nearest  USAF air  and  ground  voice  facility  and  report  the  encounter.    Include  aircraft  nationality,  type, insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed, and the type of harassment.  Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. (T-2) 6.33.2.  Other incidents will be reported as indicated in AFI 10-206,  Operational Reporting. 6.34.  In-Flight  Meals.  Pilots  should  not  eat  meals  at  the  same  time  and  their  meals  should consist of different menu items. 6.35.  High  Frequency  (HF)  Communications.  Crews  should  conduct  an  HF  radio  ground check  if  use  of  the  HF  radio  may  be  required  for  ATC  or  C2  communications.    If  unable  to establish  HF  contact  with  the  controlling  HF  station,  and  an  alternate  means  of  relay  of  ATC information is not available, the aircraft should follow theater guidance (refer to FLIP AP 1/2/3) or return to the nearest suitable support base for repairs. (T-2) 6.36.  In-flight  Emergency  Procedures.  The  PIC  shall  report  deviations  from  directives  that may  occur  as  a  result  of  an  emergency  according  to  AFI  11-202V3.    Time  and  conditions permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions. (T-2) 6.37.  Need  for  Medical  Assistance.  When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical  care, inform  the station of intended landing  in  sufficient  time so the aircraft may be met by medical personnel. Include the sex, approximate age, and the major complaint in the request. (T-2) 6.38.  Weather  Forecasts.  The  pilot  is  responsible  for  obtaining  destination  weather  prior  to arrival in the terminal area. (T-2) 6.38.1.  MAJCOMs will determine authorized weather forecasting and reporting sources.  If practical and available, normally obtain forecasts and arrange support from the home station weather flight.  If this is not practical, contact the supporting Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) for the region the flight will originate.  OWS areas of responsibility can be found in the FIH/FLIP. (T-2)   44  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 6.38.2.  The ATC system can provide weather information to en route aircraft.  In addition, weather  information  may  be  obtained  through  Automatic  Terminal  Information  Service (ATIS) and or the Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS). 6.38.2.1.  The  ARTCCs  have  a  limited  capability  to  provide  weather  information  to  en route  aircraft  within  CONUS.    Significant  Meteorological  Information  (SIGMET)  and other  National  Weather  Service  in-flight  weather  advisories  are  issued  for  large  areas.  Contact appropriate military weather facility or flight service station to determine mission applicability and impact. Section 6F—Arrival 6.39.  Descent.  Before descent into unfamiliar areas, pilots will review appropriate terrain charts to  increase  aircrew  situational  awareness  of  obstructions.    Primary  crewmembers  will  not  be involved in duties other than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the initial descent point to landing. (T-2) 6.39.1.  Night  and  Marginal  Weather  Operations.    Fly  a  precision  approach,  or  RNAV approach with glidepath guidance, if available, at night or in marginal weather. (T-2) 6.39.1.1.  A visual approach may be flown during night VMC conditions if an approved straight-in  instrument  approach  to  the  landing  runway  is  not  available.    At  familiar airfields, a non-precision, tactical approach or VFR pattern may be flown when required for currency or training. (T-2) 6.40.  Instrument Approach Procedures. 6.40.1.  Aircraft category.  The C-12 is certified by the FAA as a Category B aircraft having a  speed  range  of  91  knots  or  more  but  less  than  121  knots  throughout  the  final  approach segment  and  missed  approach.    Use  the  category  minimums  commensurate  with  the configuration appropriate speed for the approach flown.  Follow the technical order guidance when flying the approach and if it is necessary to maneuver at speeds in excess of the upper limit of a speed range for a category then the minimums for the next higher category should be used. (T-2) 6.40.2.  Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3.  Use the Approach Climb Gradient chart in the flight manual. (T-2) 6.40.3.  Weather minimums.  Before starting an instrument approach pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be at or above required approach minimums. 6.40.3.1.  For circling approaches without published minima, the required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet rounded up to the next one hundred foot value.  For example, if the HAA is  747 feet,  add 100 feet  to  get  847 feet  and then round  up  to  the  next  one  hundred  foot  value  which  would  be  900  feet.    Circling minimums will be no lower than 600 feet ceiling and 2 miles visibility. (T-2) 6.40.3.2.  Increase  the  published  visibility  minimums  of  an  instrument  approach  by  ½ statue mile (SM) or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway  approach  lighting  system  (ALS)  is  inoperative.    This  applies  only  to  the  ALS AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   45  itself,  not  to  visual  approach  slope  indicator  (VASI),  precision  approach  path  indicator (PAPI), and other lights that are not a component of the ALS. (T-2) 6.40.3.3.  If the ceiling is below the value depicted for published precision approach, but visibility  is  at  or  above  authorized  minimums,  the  PIC  will  comply  with  fuel requirements of Chapter 14, before initiating en route descent, penetration, or approach. (T-2) 6.40.4.  Flight Instrumentation Requirements. 6.40.4.1.  Full  flight  instrumentation  for  a  Category  I  ILS,  for  the  pilot  flying  the approach,  consists  of  an  attitude  indicator  (ADI),  a  course  deviation  indicator  (CDI),  a means  to  identify  the  navigational  aid  (NAVAID)  (either  aurally  or  by  verifying  the correct  station  identifier  on  the  distance  measuring  equipment  (DME)  indicator), complete differential pressure instruments, and heading/ compass systems. (T-2) 6.40.4.2.  Full  flight  instrumentation  for  a  precision  approach  radar  (PAR),  for  the  pilot flying instruments, heading/compass systems, and an attitude indicator. (T-2) the  approach,  consists  of  complete  differential  pressure 6.40.5.  Precision Approach Procedures.  Decision Altitude for precision approaches will be as published, but no lower than 200 feet HAT/HATh.  Approaches to less than 2400 RVR at locations without TDZ/CL (or when such system is inoperative) are authorized provided the approach is flown using guidance from the flight director, or coupled to the autopilot flown to the DA. (T-2) 6.40.6.  Nondirectional  beacon  (NDB)  Procedures.    NDB  approaches  may  be  flown  during day, night, or IMC conditions. (T-2) 6.40.7.  Area  Navigation  (RNAV)  Procedures.

Established on a Segment of the Approach.  When  established on a segment of the approach and the weather is reported or observed to be below approach minimums, the PIC has the option of continuing the approach to the MAP or DA (as applicable).  Do not break off an approach until cleared by ATC. (T-2) 6.40.9.1.  If  the  approach  is  continued,  the  PIC  must  have  sufficient  fuel  available  to complete the approach, missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal fuel reserve. (T-2) 6.40.10.  Holding.  An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but forecast to improve to or above minimums provided: 6.40.10.1.  The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time. (T-2) 6.40.10.2.  Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel will be consumed. (T-2) 6.41.  Classified  Equipment  and  Material.  Comply  with  the  following  or  as  directed  in MAJCOM supplement. 6.41.1.  Equipment.    When  classified  equipment  is  onboard,  ensure  the  C2  center  or  base operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security IAW Chapter 7 of this AFI.  At  bases  not  under  jurisdiction  of  the  AF,  ensure  the  aircraft  and  equipment  are  protected.  AFI  31-401,  Information  Security  Program  Management,  provides  specific  guidance concerning  the  security  of  various  levels  of  classified  equipment  aboard  aircraft.  For classified  aircraft  components  which  cannot  be  removed  and  stored,  lock  the  aircraft.    If available,  use  Ravens  to  guard  the  aircraft;  otherwise,  use  guards  employed  by  the  host country  for  flightline/airport  area  control.    Do  not  leave  unguarded  classified  information stored in navigation or radio equipment. (T-2)   48  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 6.41.2.  Material.  Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination and receipts  are obtained for COMSEC  and classified material.  The on-site C2 center will provide  temporary  storage  for  COMSEC  and  other  classified  materials  during  en  route, turnaround, and crew rest stops.  Encrypted COMSEC will only be transferred to authorized DoD  personnel.    IAW  Air  Force  Systems  Security  Instruction  (AFSSI)  3021,  Operational Security Instruction for the AN/CYZ-10/10A Data Transfer Device (DTD), after picking up material from a security facility, the crypto-ignition key (CIK) should be removed from the CYZ-10 and only inserted into the CYZ-10 when using this device. (T-2) 6.41.2.1.  Remain  overnight  (RON)  COMSEC  Storage.    Refer  to  AFI  33-201V1, Communications  Security  (COMSEC),  for  additional  guidance.    Every  effort  should  be made to store classified material in a secure facility (i.e. Base Operations/Command Post) if that facility exists.  If remaining overnight at a location that does not or cannot provide this storage capability, then the following procedures should be used: 6.41.2.1.1.  If  carrying  an  electronic  keyed  device,  (i.e.  CYZ-10),  the  key  will  be removed  from  the  device  and  carried  by  one  of  the  pilots.    Place  the  device somewhere  on  the  aircraft  not  in  plain  view  (i.e.  under  a  seat,  in  a  closet,  in  the baggage compartment). (T-2) 6.41.2.1.2.  If  using  a  KOI-18  or  KYK-13,  the  entire  device  may  be  placed  in  its sealable/  tamper  resistant  pouch  and  placed  in  a  securable  storage  box.    The  pouch will be locked and the key will be kept by an aircrew member. (T-2) 6.41.2.1.3.  All  classified  documents  (authenticators,  SPINS  extracts,  etc.)  will  be locked in a securable storage box.  The key to the box will also be carried at all times by one of the pilots.  The aircraft will then be locked, including the emergency exit.  Upon  return  to  the  aircraft,  the  crew  must  inspect  the  aircraft  and  documents  for tampering  and  report  any  suspected  or  possible  compromise  immediately,  even  if  it delays the mission. (T-2) 6.41.3.  Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable MODE 4 when required for mission accomplishment.    Aircrews  will  conduct  an  operational  ground  test  of  the  Mode  4  (ground test  assets  permitting)  before  deployment  overseas,  or  as  specified  in  the  OPORD  or contingency/exercise tasking. (T-2) 6.41.4.  Attempt  to  fix  an  inoperable  MODE  4  before  takeoff.    Do  not  delay  takeoff  nor cancel  a  mission  for  an  inoperable  Mode  4,  except  when  the  aircraft  will  transit  an  area where safe passage procedures are implemented. (T-2) 6.41.5.  Aircraft  with  inoperable  MODE  4  will  continue  to  their  intended  destinations.  Repairs  will  be  accomplished  at  the  first  destination  where  equipment,  parts,  and maintenance  technicians  are  available.    In  theaters  where  safe  passage  is  implemented, aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable MODE 4 as directed in the applicable Airspace Control Order (ACO). (T-2) 6.41.6.  Ground  and  in-flight  checks  of  the  MODE  4,  when  conducted,  are  mandatory maintenance debrief items.  Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of the Mode 4 on all aircraft forms (AFTO Form 781A).  (T-2)    NOTE:  AFI11-202V3 5.8.2. restricts MODE 4 operations. AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   49  6.41.7.  Aircrews  will  carry  COMSEC  equipment  and  documents  required  to  operate  the Mode 4 on missions when required  for mission accomplishment.    Before departing for any destination  without  COMSEC  storage  facilities,  crews  will  contact  their  local  COMSEC managers for guidance. (T-2) 6.42.  Maintenance.  Complete AFTO Form 781 after each flight.  After landing, crewmembers will debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft.  At stations where there is no maintenance,  and  maintenance  support  is  required,  crews  should  contact  their  home  unit  or maintenance  contractor  for  guidance.    Notify  controlling  C2  and  home  station  of  maintenance status before entering crew rest. (T-2) 6.43.  Border Clearance. 6.43.1.  Normal Operations.  The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border clearance of its aircraft. (T-2) 6.43.1.1.  When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.  Duties may be assigned to ground personnel, but the PIC retains ultimate responsibility.  When a C-12 aircraft is onloaded at a base without a passenger processing function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following: 6.43.1.1.1.  Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid visas, when required. (T-2) 6.43.1.1.2.  Crewmembers,  troops,  and  passengers  have  current    certificates  of immunization (shot record). (T-2) 6.43.1.1.3.  Cargo entry documents are in proper order. (T-2) 6.43.1.1.4.  Departing  or  entering  the  US  through  a  location  where  border  clearance can be obtained. (T-2) 6.43.1.1.5.  Obtaining  border  clearance  for  aircraft  cargo,  passengers,  crew  and baggage,  if  required,  before  takeoff  to  a  foreign  area  or  after  arrival  from  a  foreign area. (T-2) 6.43.1.1.6.  Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and Paragraph 6.44). (T-2) 6.43.2.  Procedures for US Entry. 6.43.2.1.  En route, distribute personal  customs declarations (when not  accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers.  The PIC will designate a crewmember to brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and prepare and compile necessary border clearance forms for the PIC’s signature. (T-2) 6.43.2.2.  En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in ETA  to  ensure  that  border  clearance  is  accomplished  as  soon  as  possible  after  landing. (T-2) 6.43.2.3.  Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require an aircraft, which has  landed  in  the  US  for  customs  clearance,  to  proceed  to  another  base  in  the  US  to obtain  border  clearance.    The  permit  to  proceed  delays  customs  inspection  of  cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection.  The permit to proceed is valid   50  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 only  to  the  airport  of  next  landing  where  the  border  clearance  must  be  completed  or  a new  permit  to  proceed  issued  by  a  customs  official.    Do  not  make  intermediate  stops between  the  issue  point  of  the  permit  to  proceed  and  destination  of  manifested  cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2 center. (T-2) 6.43.2.4.  When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative normally  will  meet  the  aircraft  to  obtain  the  required  documents.    Do  not  deplane passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life and property.  Do not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their designated representatives.  This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all landings  required  when  operating  on  a  permit  to  proceed  or  until  all  crew,  passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance. (T-2) 6.43.3.  Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials. 6.43.3.1.  Follow  USAF  policy  on  status  of  military  aircraft  as  stated  in  the  FCG.    In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are immune from searches, seizures, and  inspections  (including  customs  and  safety  inspections)  by  foreign  officials.    In addition,  PICs  must  be  aware  of,  and  adhere  to,  any  specific  FCG  provisions  for individual countries. (T-2) 6.43.3.2.  If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use the following procedures. 6.43.3.2.1.  In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials in the country concerned.  This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft. (T-2) 6.43.3.2.2.  If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make every  effort  to  delay  the  search  until  he  or  she  can  contact  USAF  headquarters (through  MAJCOM  C2)  or  the  appropriate  embassy  officials.    The  PIC  should  then notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and follow their instructions. (T-2) 6.43.3.2.3.  If  foreign  officials  refuse  to  desist  in  their  search  request,  pending notification  to  USAF  headquarters  or  the  appropriate  embassy,  the  PIC  should indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do so. (T-2) 6.43.3.2.4.  If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way  on  board  an  aircraft,  the  PIC  should  state  that  he  protests  the  course  of  action being  pursued  and  that  he  intends  to  notify  both  USAF  headquarters  and  the appropriate  American  embassy  of  the  foreign  action.    The  PIC  should  not  attempt physical  resistance,  and  should  thereafter  report  the  incident  to  USAF  headquarters and  appropriate  embassy  as  soon  as  possible.    The  PIC  should  escort  foreign authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   51  6.43.4.  Exercises and Contingency Operations. 6.43.4.1.  General.  Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit,  require  special  procedures  to  expedite  compliance  with  customs,  public  health, immunization,  and  agricultural  requirements.    A  joint  memorandum  of  understanding, between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers. 6.43.4.2.  Implementation.    Implementation  of  the  agreement  is  not  automatic.    Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each operation.    Inspection  and  clearance  may  be  accomplished  at  the  US  onload  or  offload base, or at the foreign onload or offload base. 6.43.4.3.  Customs Procedures. 6.43.4.3.1.  Outbound:  No requirement. 6.43.4.3.2.  Inbound.  Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival: 6.43.4.3.2.1.  CF 7507 (Passenger list not required). (T-2) 6.43.4.3.2.2.

One  copy  of  the  US  Customs  Baggage  Declaration  Form  for each  passenger  not  under  command  of  the  troop  commander,  to  include observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers. (T-2) 6.43.4.3.2.3.3.  Upon  arrival  at  a  CONUS  offload  base,  a  customs representative  will  meet  the  aircraft  and  accept  the  troop  commander's certificate with respect to troop baggage.  Individual baggage declarations are not required.  The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage. (T-2) 6.43.4.3.2.3.4.  Troops  will  debark  under  the  observation  of  the  customs representative  with  only  a  spot  check  of  articles  and  baggage.    The  customs officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection. (T-2) 6.43.4.3.2.4.  For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more: 6.43.4.3.2.4.1.  One copy of the U.S. Customs Baggage Declaration Form for each  passenger.    This  includes  observers,  support  personnel,  civilians,  news media  personnel,  and  crewmembers.    Personnel  may  use  DD  Form  1854  or CF  6059B, Customs Declaration. (T-2) 6.43.4.3.2.4.2.  Upon  arrival  at  a  CONUS  offload  base,  a  customs representative will meet  the aircraft and collect  all declarations.  Troops will debark  under  the  observation  of  the  customs  representative  who  may  make discretionary examination of the baggage. (T-2) 6.43.4.4.  Public Health Procedures.   52  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 6.43.4.4.1.  When operating from a base without a public health officer, the PIC will ensure all crewmembers and passengers are properly immunized. (T-2) 6.43.4.4.2.  Spray the aircraft if required. (T-2) 6.43.4.5.  Immigration Procedures. 6.43.4.5.1.  Outbound:  No requirements. 6.43.4.5.2.  Inbound:    Submit  the  following  to  the  immigration  inspector  if  carrying civilian passengers. 6.43.4.5.2.1.  One copy of CF 7507. (T-2) 6.43.4.6.  Agriculture Procedures: 6.43.4.6.1.  Outbound:  No requirement. 6.43.4.6.2.  Inbound:  Consult AMC Border Clearance Guide. (T-2) 6.43.4.6.2.1.  The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit, milk,  milk  products,  vegetables,  plants,  plant  pests,  soil  samples,  animals,  meat, and  animal  products  can  be  brought  into  the  US.    All  items  of  troop  personal gear/cargo are to be cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other foreign material before being  brought  aboard  the  aircraft.    Personal  gear  and  equipment  must  be examined for snails and other plant pests to prevent their accidental entry into the U.S. (T-2) 6.43.4.6.2.2.  Before  loading,  the  command  responsible  for  cargo  being  airlifted will clear cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil. (T-2) 6.43.4.6.2.3.  When  required  by  agricultural  quarantine  regulations,  the  FCG,  or higher  headquarters,  the  aircraft  will  receive  an  aerosol  treatment  30  minutes before landing. (T-2) 6.43.4.6.2.4.  On  arrival,  agricultural  inspectors  will  inspect  the  aircraft  after passengers have disembarked.   Crewmembers  will  assemble remains  of in-flight lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel. (T-2) 6.43.4.6.2.5.  Inspectors  examine  baggage,  equipment,  and  cargo  as  offloaded.  Any  items  found  to  be  contaminated  will  be  held  for  such  treatment  as  the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical cleaning, or fumigation). (T-2) 6.43.5.  Military  Customs  Pre-clearance  Inspection  Program.    All  crewmembers  will  ensure compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements. (T-2) 6.44.  Insect and Pest Control. 6.44.1.  Responsibility.    PICs  will  ensure  required  spraying  is  accomplished  according  to AFJI  48-104,  Quarantine  Regulations  of  the  Armed  Forces,  DoD  FCG,  or  as  directed  by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on CF 7507, or on forms provided by the country transited.  Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on board.  The only exception is when mandated by the FCG. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   53  6.44.1.1.  When  spraying  is  required,  use  insecticide,  aerosol  d-phenothrin-2  percent, National  Stock  Number  (NSN)  6840-01-067-6674  (or  equivalent),  to  spray  the  aircraft.  Wear leather or Nomex® gloves while spraying. (T-2) 6.44.1.1.1.  Direct  the  nozzle  toward  the  ceiling  of  the  compartment  or  space  being sprayed. (T-2) 6.44.1.1.2.  Spray  spaces  inaccessible  from  within  the  aircraft  after  completely loading  fuel,  baggage,  cargo,  and  passengers,  including  baggage  compartments, wheel wells, and other similar spaces. (T-2) 6.44.1.1.3.  Spray  the  cabin,  cockpit,  and  other  spaces  accessible  from  within  the aircraft  after  the  crew  is  aboard  and  after  closing  all  doors,  windows,  hatches,  and ventilation  openings. label  directs disembarkation after use, spray before boarding crew or passengers.  Close all doors and  hatches  for  10  minutes  after  dispensing  and  ventilate  for  15  minutes  before allowing anyone on board. (T-2)  CAUTION: If  the insecticide 6.44.1.2.  Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being transited.  Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be disposed of safely. (T-2) 6.44.2.  Responsibility of PIC In-flight.  When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft. (T-2) 6.44.3.  Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD).  On arrival at an APOD, do not open  cargo  doors  or  hatches  except  to  enplane  officials  required  to  inspect  the  aircraft  for insect or rodent infestation.  Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection is  satisfactorily  completed.    This  procedure  may  be  altered  to  satisfy  mission  or  local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization. (T-2) Section 6G—Miscellaneous 6.45.  Dropped  Object  Prevention.  If  an  externally  dropped  object  is  discovered,  the  flight crew will notify ATC and C2 as soon as practical. (T-2) 6.46.  Cockpit  Voice  Recorder  (CVR).  If  involved  in  a  mishap  or  incident,  after  landing  and terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker. (T-2) 6.47.  Passenger  Restrictions.  No-show passenger baggage or baggage of passengers removed from flight will be downloaded prior to departure. (T-2) 6.48.  Life  Support  and  Dash  21  Equipment.  Prior  to  departure,  ensure  appropriate  life support, survival, and Dash 21 equipment are aboard the aircraft. (T-2) 6.48.1.  Prior  to  departure,  review,  sign,  and  date  the  AFTO  Form  46,  Pre-positioned  Life Support Equipment. (T-2) 6.48.2.  Prior to departure, ensure survival gear configuration matches mission requirements. For over-water missions, confirm appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard. (T-2)   54  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 6.48.3.  Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will: 6.48.3.1.  Make an AFTO Form 781 entry for missing equipment. (T-2) 6.48.3.2.  Annotate  AFTO  Form  46  in  the  next  vacant  column  indicating  the  quantity remaining for the item. (T-2) 6.48.4.  Aircraft commanders will determine whether or not to replace the missing equipment before continuing the mission. (T-2) 6.49.  Impoundment  of  Aircraft.  If  an  aircraft  is  involved  in  a  serious  in-flight  incident,  the PIC should impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the controlling C2 agency for further instructions. (T-2) 6.50.  Wake  Turbulence  Avoidance.  The  C-12  is  turbulence  category  II.    Comply  with  wake turbulence  avoidance  criteria.    Acceptance  of  traffic  information,  instructions  to  follow  an aircraft, or a visual approach clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing  intervals  and  accepts  responsibility  of  providing  wake  turbulence  separation.    Refer  to FLIP GP for additional information. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   55  Chapter 7 AIRCRAFT SECURITY 7.1.  General.  This  chapter provides  guidance on aircraft security and preventing  and resisting aircraft  piracy  (hijacking).    AFI  13-207,  Preventing  and  Resisting  Aircraft  Piracy  (Hijacking), AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense  (FOUO),  FAA  Notice  (FAAN)  7110.422,  Aircraft  Hijack  and Suspicious  Inflight  Activities  Response  and  Notification  Procedures,  and  specific  MAJCOM security  publications  contain  additional  guidance.    Aircrews  will  not  release  information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public. (T-2) 7.2.  Security.  Aircraft security at non-United States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency and/or PIC. (T-2) 7.3.  Air  Force  Installation  Security  Program.  The  following  security  procedures  will implement AFI 31-101 requirements for C-12 aircraft: 7.3.1.  Protecting  Distinguished  Visitor  (DV)  Aircraft.    When  the  DV  is  a  Code  4  (3-star general or civilian equivalent) or above, follow these procedures: 7.3.1.1.  Parking  Locations.    Park  DV  aircraft  in  a  prominent  area  so  maintenance personnel and security forces patrols can closely monitor aircraft. (T-2) 7.3.1.2.  Notification  Procedures.    Establish  procedures  to  inform  security  forces  of  the arrival, parking arrangements, and departure of all DV aircraft. (T-2) 7.3.2.  At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter.  If he or she determines  security  to  be  inadequate,  the  aircraft  will  depart  to  a  station  where  adequate security is available. (T-2) 7.3.3.  The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft.  The security force POC must be identified to the PIC. (T-2) 7.4.  Locking and Sealing.  Lock the aircraft during a RON on non-secure ramps. (T-2) 7.5.  En  Route  Security.  The  planning  agency  must  coordinate  with  the  execution  agency  to ensure adequate en route security is available.  PIC will receive a threat assessment and en route security  capability  evaluation  briefing  for  areas  of  intended  operation  prior  to  home  station departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. (T-2) 7.5.1.  Arrival.    On  arrival,  the  PIC  will  assess  the  local  situation  and  take  the  following actions as required: 7.5.1.1.  Area  patrol.    Request  area  security  patrols  from  local  security  forces.    If  local authorities request payment for this service, use SF 44. (T-2) 7.5.1.2.  Aircrew surveillance.  During short ground times, direct armed crew members to remain  with  the  aircraft  and  maintain  surveillance  of  aircraft  entrances  and  activities  in the aircraft vicinity. (T-2) 7.5.1.3.  Inadequate Security.  If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate and  the  PIC  determines  the  safety  of  the  aircraft  is  in  question,  the  PIC  may  waive  the   56  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 FDP  limits  and  crew  rest  requirements  and  depart  as  soon  as  possible  for  a  base considered reliable.  Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as practical.  If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their  ability.    In  no  case,  will  the  entire  crew  leave  the  aircraft  unattended.    Crew  rest requirements  will  be  subordinate  to  aircraft  security  when  the  airframe  may  be  at  risk.  The  PIC  should  rotate  a  security  detail  among  the  crew  to  provide  for  both  aircraft protection  and  crew  rest  until  relief  is  available.    Request  security  assistance  from  the nearest  DoD  installation,  US  Embassy,  local  military  or  law  enforcement  agencies  as appropriate. (T-2) 7.5.2.  Normally,  non-United  States  nationals,  such  as  cargo  handlers,  can  perform  their duties under escort and should not be placed on the Entry Access List (EAL). (T-2) 7.5.3.  Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area. (T-2) 7.6.  Detecting Unauthorized Entry. 7.6.1.  When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed to allow ground personnel immediate access.  If, in the PIC judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked in order to detect unauthorized entry, then: 7.6.1.1.  Use available aircraft ground security locking devices. (T-2) 7.6.1.2.  Secure  the  doors  in  a  manner  that  will  indicate  unauthorized  entry  (e.g.,  tape inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose). v 7.6.1.3.  Close and lock the door. (T-2) 7.6.1.4.  Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of a forced entry. (T-2) 7.6.1.5.  Report  any  unauthorized  entry  or  tampering  to  the  Air  Force  Office  of  Special Investigation  (AFOSI),  security  forces  or  local  authorities,  and  the  C2  agency.    Have aircraft thoroughly inspected prior to flight. (T-2) 7.6.2.  Security  awareness  is  crucial  to  effective  mission  accomplishment.    Aircrews  must always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.  In  addition  to  normal  preflight  activities,  aircrews  must  inspect  areas  of  the  aircraft  not covered by normal preflight duties, to include inside inboard main landing gear doors, nose wheel compartment, and the aft avionics bay for unfamiliar devices.  Report any suspicious items  to  host  security  forces.    Aircrews  will  maintain  a  heightened  security  posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities. (T-2) 7.7.  Preventing and Resisting Hijacking. 7.7.1.  The  Administrator,  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA),  pursuant  to  Title  49, United States Code, section 44903(e), has exclusive responsibility to direct law enforcement activity in responding to an actual or suspected air piracy (hijacking) situation involving all aircraft (civil and military) in-flight in the United States. (T-1) 7.7.2.  Military  forces  taking  action  during  an  aircraft  hijacking  situation  will  act  under military command within the scope of their duties. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   57  7.7.3.  In  the  event  an  aircraft  involved  in  an  aircraft  hijacking  situation  is  carrying documents,  equipment,  or  material  that  DoD  has  determined  to  be  highly  sensitive,  or weapons  of  mass  destruction,  DoD  will  provide  FAA,  and  where  appropriate,  the  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information.  Where possible, the FAA will consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity. (T-2) 7.7.4.  An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft is operationally ready for flight. 7.7.5.  A  concerted  effort  must  be  made  to  prevent  the  hijacking  of  military  or  military contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft. (T-2) 7.7.6.  Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation. (T-2) 7.8.  Preventive  Measures.  Commanders  at  all  levels  must  ensure  preventive  measures  are taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers.  (T-2) 7.8.1.  Preventive  measures  include  thorough  passenger  anti-hijacking  inspections.    Do  not board  passengers  until  the  PIC  is  fully  satisfied  with  inspection  results.    In  the  absence  of qualified passenger service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage is accomplished. (T-2) 7.8.2.  Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.  When  patients  are  delivered  to  the  aircraft  by  civilian  sources,  the  aircrew  will  perform required inspections prior to loading. (T-2) 7.8.3.  Passengers  will  not  carry  weapons  or  ammunition  on  their  person  or  in  hand-carried baggage  aboard  an  aircraft.    (T-2)        EXCEPTION:    Special  agents,  guards  of  the  Secret Service  or  State  Department,  Raven  Team  Members,  and  other  individuals  specifically authorized to carry weapons. 7.8.4.  Troops  or  deadhead  crewmembers  will  not  retain  custody  of  ammunition  on  an aircraft.    They  will  turn  it  in  to  the  troop  commander  or  PIC.    Troops  may  carry  unloaded weapons  and  ammunition  aboard  the  aircraft  during  combat  operations.    When  the  tactical situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at the order of the troop commander or team leader. (T-2) 7.8.5.  If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to move to a safe, clear area at least  50  feet  from  any  aircraft,  equipment,  or  personnel  before  un-holstering  or  un-slinging weapons. (T-2) 7.9.  Initial  Response.  When an act  of air piracy  involves an AF installation or aircraft within the US, response will be according to FAA procedures.  Resist all attempts to hijack a military aircraft. (T-2) 7.10.  In-Flight  Resistance.  After  airborne,  success  in  thwarting  a  hijacking  depends  on  the resourcefulness  of  the  aircrew.    Many  variables  of  a  hijacking  preclude  using  any  specific counter-hijacking procedure.  Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life, or damage to the aircraft in flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material on board.   58  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 7.11.  Communications  Between  Aircrew  and  Ground  Agencies.  Crews  facing  a  hijacking threat will notify ground agencies in accordance with FIH. (T-2) 7.12.  Forced  Penetration  of  Unfriendly  Airspace.  Refer  to  FIH  for  international  signals  for air intercept. (T-2) 7.13.  Arming  of  Crew  Members.  When  crews  are  directed  to  carry  weapons,  one  pilot  will normally be armed.  All crew members should know who is armed.  The following procedures apply when arming is directed: 7.13.1.  Weapons  Issue.    Before  departing  home  station,  obtain  weapons,  ammunition,  box, lock  and  key.    Crew  members  will  be  armed  according  to  C2  directives  and  MAJCOM publications. (T-2) 7.13.2.  Wearing of Weapons.  Wear weapon in a holster.  Conceal weapon when directed to prevent identifying armed crew members.  Do not wear weapon off the flight line except to and from the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities.  In general, at  overseas  locations,  weapons  are  not  to  be  brought  off  the  aircraft.    In  countries  where FCG/Status  of  Forces  Agreement  (SOFA)  authorizes  such  action,  every  effort  should  be made  to  keep  all  firearms  onboard  the  aircraft  unless  appropriately  responding  to  a  hostile event or being moved to/from storage at an armory.  Raven weapons are not to be brought off the aircraft unless responding to hostile action or being moved to/ from storage at an armory. (T-2) 7.13.2.1.  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC)  Passenger  Terminal  Procedures.    Armed crewmembers  must  discreetly  identify  themselves  to  AMC  passenger  service  personnel upon arrival  at  security  checkpoints.   One crewmember will present  a valid set  of crew orders,  military  identification  card,  and  AF  Form  523,  USAF  Authorization  to  Bear Firearms,  authorizing  the  carrying  of  concealed  weapons.    Once  terminal  personnel verify  this,  they  will  allow  the  crewmember  to  vouch  for  the  remaining  crewmembers.  The  entire  crew  will  then  proceed  through  the  magnetometer  without  removing  objects from their pockets.  This will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed. (T-2) 7.14.  Force  Protection.  Crews  must  be  alert  to  possibility  of  terrorist  activities  at  all  times. Reference  AFMAN  10-100,  Airman’s  Manual  and  AFI  10-245,  Air  Force  Antiterrorism Standards, for Force Protection measures. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   59  Chapter 8 OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS 8.1.  General.  This  chapter  provides  guidelines  for  worksheets,  reports,  and  forms  associated with  MAJCOM  operational  activities.    Consult  governing  instruction  or  contact  wing,  unit,  or local flight safety officers for assistance with safety forms. 8.2.  AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report.  The AF Form 457 is a tool to notify supervisors and commanders  of  a  hazardous  condition  that  requires  prompt  corrective  action.    For  hazardous weather, complete the front side of an AF Form 457 and send it to the parent wing flying safety office.    If  addressing  a  computer  flight  plan  deficiency,  attach  a  copy  of  the  AF  Form  72,  Air Report  (AIREP).  Ensure  the  parent  unit  receives  it  within  5  days  of  the  event.

This  section prescribes  aviation  POL  (AVPOL)  procedures  that  ensure  correct  documentation,  form  and invoice processing, and program supervision.  Use the Aviation Into-Plane Reimbursement Card (AIR  CARD)  for  the  purchase  of  aviation  fuel  and  ancillary  ground  services  at  commercial airports (and some military installations) worldwide.  The Air Card is  authorized for use by all U.S.    government  aircraft,  state,  and  local  law  enforcement  aircraft,  and  some  foreign government aircraft.  All PICs should plan to use the platinum AIR CARD.  In most cases, there will  be  no  changes  when  refueling  at  non-Defense  Energy  Support  Center  (DESC)  contract locations.  The AIR CARD is accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide.  A list of all MSC accepting merchants can be found at  https://www.airseacard.com.  It replaces the SF 44 at locations that accept the AIR CARD. 8.6.1.  Responsibilities.    Aircrew  and  maintenance  personnel  will  be  familiar  with  AVPOL procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter.  Improper use of the AIR CARD could create financial liability for the purchaser. (T-2) 8.6.2.  Refuel/defuel  USAF aircraft at  DoD locations  whenever possible.    If  DoD service is not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority: 8.6.2.1.  Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) or Canadian into-plane contracts. (T-2) 8.6.2.2.  Foreign government air forces. (T-2)    NOTE:  DoD FLIP en route supplements identify locations with into-plane contracts. 8.6.3.  AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures. 8.6.3.1.  The DD 1898, Fuel Sale Slip, is the fuel transaction receipt used for purchases at other  DoD  locations,  including  DFSC  into-plane  contract  locations.    NOTE:    If  the contractor  insists  on  a  unique  invoice  along  with  the  DD1898,  annotate  the  vendor’s invoice with “DUPLICATE DD1898 ACCOMPLISHED”. 8.6.3.2.  The SF 44 may be used to purchase fuel, ground services and/or other authorized products when no AIR CARD contract is in place. 8.6.3.2.1.  The aircrew shall present  the SF 44 as the purchase invoice when a fixed base  operator  (FBO)  refuses  to  accept  the  AIR  CARD.    The  aircrew  shall  complete the SF 44 and attach it to the FBO vendor ticket/invoice when the FBO also declines use  of  the  SF  44  and  uses  its  own  invoice/receipt.    Fuel  purchases  shall  be documented on a separate SF 44 from ground services and other authorized products AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   63  since the FBO must invoice DESC for the fuel and the customer for non-fuel product and services. (T-2) 8.6.3.2.1.1.  Copies 1 and 2 of the SF 44 shall be provided to the FBO.  Copy 1 of the  SF  44  and  one  copy  of  the  FBO  commercial  invoice,  if  applicable,  shall  be forwarded  to  the  following  address  by  the  FBO  to  bill/invoice  DESC:  DESC- RRF,  Building  1621-K,  2261  Hughes  Avenue,  Suite  128,  Lackland  AFB,  Texas 78236. 8.6.3.2.1.2.  Copy 3 of the SF 44 and one copy of the FBO commercial invoice, if applicable,  shall  be  provided  to  the  aircrew.    Aircrews  shall  present  all  fuel purchase  receipts  to  the  designated  aviation  squadron  Certifying  Official  and/or Accountable Official upon return to home station to enable timely validation and financial obligation processing into the Fuels Automated System (FAS). (T-2) 8.6.3.3.  Fuel purchases where the FBO requires cash payment.  Cash fuel purchases are only authorized when either the DoD 4500.54G, DoD Foreign Clearance Guide, requires cash  payment  or  when  FBO  locations  outside  the  US  and  US  Territories  refuse  AIR CARD and/or SF 44 invoicing processes.  Aircrews required to pay cash for aviation fuel purchases  shall  employ  the  following  procedures:    NOTE:    These  procedures  do  not apply to non-fuel products or services. 8.6.3.3.1.  The  aircrew  shall  obtain  cash  from  a  local  DoD  Finance  source  that  is charged  to  an  approved  Treasury  suspense  account  prior  to  home  station  departure. (T-2) 8.6.3.3.2.  Aircrews  shall  complete  the  SF  44  and  obtain  the  FBO  fuel  vendor annotation  in  block 11 of the SF 44 to  confirm  total  cash amount and  also  sign and date the SF 44 blocks 20 and 21.  Aircrew shall return unused cash to their local DoD Finance source upon return to home station.  Present the completed SF 44 (for non- fuel  charges  only)  to  the  appropriate  home  station  administrative  personnel  for processing  (e.g.,  Wing  Refueling  Document  Control  Officer,  Finance  Office,  etc.). (T-2) 8.6.3.4.  Purchases of ground services and other approved products (not fuel). 8.6.3.4.1.  Complete  a  separate  SF  44  for  non-fuel  purchases.    Provide  the  FBO copies  1  and  2  of  the  SF  44.    The  FBO  shall  use  copy  1  and  one  copy  of  the  FBO commercial invoice, if applicable, to directly bill/invoice the purchasing organization.  Block  9  of  the  SF  44  shall  reflect  the  organization  name  and  address  of  the  finance office responsible for payment to the FBO.  The purchasing organization shall make payment to the FBO upon receipt of the invoice from the FBO. (T-2) 8.6.3.4.2.  If the vendor presents their own form for signature and accepts the SF 44, write the statement "SF 44 Executed" on the vendor’s form. (T-2) 8.6.3.4.3.  Turn in two copies of the SF 44 to the operations officer at home station. (T-3) 8.6.3.5.  DD  1896  is  the  aircraft  fuel  and  oil  charge  card  normally  used  at  military locations for refueling transactions.   64  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 8.6.3.6.  Present  the  aircraft  Identaplate  for  purchases  at  SITCO  agreement  locations.

To simulate loss of an engine, announce “Simulated” on interphone  prior  to  pulling  the  POWER  lever  to  IDLE.    The  corresponding  PROPELLER lever should then be pulled to the minimum primary governor setting and the POWER lever advanced slightly to simulate a feathered propeller and zero thrust condition (NOTE:  Do not feather the propeller).  By using this standard configuration, the inherent delays of restarting a  shutdown  engine  or  unfeathering  a  propeller  are  avoided  and  almost  instant  power  is available by pushing the POWER and PROPELLER levers forward. (T-2) 9.3.  Touch-and-Go  Landings.  Touch-and-go  landings  will  only  be  accomplished  under  the direct supervision of a current and qualified IP.

The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global operations of  air  mobility  forces.    This  chapter  describes  the  CBRN  threat,  passive  defense  measures  to mitigate  that  threat,  and  guidance  for  ground  and  flight  operations  in  a  contaminated environment.  NOTE:  Aircrew flying C-12 aircraft not modified/equipped to support the wear of the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) will treat the instructions in this chapter as non-directive.    However,  all  crew  members  are  responsible  for  maintaining  a  thorough knowledge of aircrew chemical operations/procedures. 10.2.  Understanding the CBRN Threat. 10.2.1.  Chemical  Weapons.    Militarily  significant  chemical  weapons  include  nerve,  blister, choking, and blood agents.  A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on your side.  The ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates of  chemicals  all  decrease  their  lethality.    Most  chemical  agents  will  either  evaporate  or absorb  into  surfaces.    For  decontamination,  cleaning  with  hot  soap  and  water  and/or  a  5 percent  bleach  solution  currently  appears  to  be  the  best  and  most  practical  method  of removing  chemical    agents    that  may  remain  as  a  contact  hazard  on  glass,  and  unpainted metal.  Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is soap and water. (T-2)        NOTE:    Recent  tests  indicate  that  as  a  decontaminated  aircraft  dries,  the  absorbed chemical  warfare  agent  (CWA)  may  resurface  from  painted  surfaces  causing  contact  and vapor hazards. 10.2.2.  Biological  Weapons.    Biological  warfare  agents  (BWA)  are  normally  divided  into three  areas:  bacteria  (i.e.,  Anthrax)  that  live  outside  the  cell,  reproduce,  and  are  normally susceptible to antibiotics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms or plants; and viruses (i.e., Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive and  reproduce.    Viruses  and  toxins  do  not  respond  to  antibiotics.    It  is  probable  that  the medical community would be the first to recognize that an upsurge in flu-like symptoms‖ is actually  a  biological  attack.    Although  BWA  are  degraded  by  UV  rays,  humidity  and high/low  temperatures,  some  BWA  (i.e.,  Anthrax  spores)  may  have  a  long  life,  lasting decades under the right conditions.  Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help prevent infection. 10.2.3.  Radiological  Weapons.    The  radiation  dispersal  device  (RDD),  or  so-called  dirty bomb, is the typical  radiological weapon.  RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive material without using a nuclear detonation.  Key points to remember are that shielding and distance are the best defenses against radiation exposure. 10.2.4.  Nuclear  Weapons.    The  threat  from  a  nuclear  device  is  from  the  initial  blast,  heat, and radiation.  In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear detonation can damage  electronic  equipment.    The  best  protection  is  a  combination  of  shielding,  distance from the blast, and limited time of exposure. AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   69  10.3.  CBRN  Passive  Defense  Measures.  Passive  defense  measures  are  those  activities conducted  to  negate,  contain,  and  manage  the  effects  of  a  CBRN  attack.    Passive  defense measures  include  pre,  trans,  and  post-attack  actions  designed  to  mitigate  the  CBRN  threat through contamination avoidance, protection, and contamination control. 10.3.1.  Contamination Avoidance.  Contamination avoidance is  the most  important  passive defense  measure.    Techniques  for  contamination  avoidance  include:    inflight  diversion, survival  launch,  and  minimizing  exposure  to  contaminated  cargo,  aerospace  ground equipment (AGE), and material handling equipment (MHE). 10.3.1.1.  Inflight  Diversion.    When  advised  that  a  destination  airfield  is  under  CBRN attack or has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if at  all  possible.    Authority  to  land  at  a  contaminated  airfield  will  be  specified  in  the controlling OPORD. (T-2) 10.3.1.2.  Survival  Launch.    If  caught  on  the  ground  during  attack  warning,  every reasonable  effort  will  be  made  to  launch  to  avoid  the  attack.    Upon  proper  clearances, aircrew may launch to survive if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to the  runway.    In  practice,  this  option  may  only  be  practical  for  aircraft  that  have  just landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway.  If launch is not possible, shut down engines  and  avoid   Close  aircraft doors/hatches/ramps,  don  Individual  Protective  Equipment  (IPE),  and  seek  personal protective cover on the base.  If time does not permit using base facilities, remain in the sealed  aircraft  for  a  minimum  of  one-hour  after  the  attack  and/or  follow  host-base guidance. (T-2) running  environmental  control  systems. 10.3.1.3.  Avoiding  Cross  Contamination  from  AGE,  MHE,  and  Cargo.    All  formerly contaminated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance and  the  use  of  protective  measures.    Additionally,  the  air  shipment  of  formerly contaminated  cargo  requires  special  precautions  and  must  be  specifically  authorized  by the senior transportation commander. (T-2) 10.3.2.  Protection.  When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided, protection provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRN environment.  Protection  is  afforded  by  individual  protective  equipment,  collective  protection,  and hardening of facilities. 10.3.2.1.  Individual  Protective  Equipment.    The  current  in-flight  protective  gear  for aircrew members is  the Aircrew Chemical  Defense Ensemble.  The ACDE includes  the newer Aircrew Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the shoulders and the CWU-66/P  or  CWU-77/P  Integrated  Aircrew  Chemical  Coverall  (IACC).    The  Ground Crew  Ensemble  (GCE)  consists  of  the  protective  mask,  C2  series  canister  (or  filter element  for  MCU-2A/P  protective  mask),  and  over  garment,  boots,  and  gloves.    The ACDE and GCE provide protection against chemical and biological agents.  They do not provide  blast  or  radiation  protection  from  an  RDD  or  nuclear  detonation.    The  ACDE requires  care  during  donning  using  "buddy  dressing"  procedures  and  Aircrew  Life Support  (ALS)  expertise  during  processing  through  the  Aircrew  Contamination  Control Area (ACCA).  NOTE: Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members (AECM) will utilize the MCU-2A series mask. (T-2)   70  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 10.3.2.1.1.  ACDE/GCE  Issue.    Aircrews  will  be  issued  sized  ACDE  and  GCE  at home station.  Aircrews  will ensure their ACDE  and GCE  are available at  all times while  in  a  CBRN  threat  area.    Aircrew  members  will  confirm  the  mobility  bag contents and correct sizes. (T-2) 10.3.2.1.2.  ACDE Wear During Ground Operations.  Because aircraft contamination is unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations can represent the highest threat to aircrew safety.  Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents is  paramount.    Aircrew  should  limit  activities  to  essential  duties  only,  and  separate ground duties from air duties. 10.3.2.2.  Collective Protection.  Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled, contamination-free  environment  to  allow  personnel  relief  from  continuous  wear  of  IPE such as the ACDE.  The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is to employ overpressure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit.  The intent is to provide rest and  relief  accommodations,  as  well  as  provide  medical  treatment  in  contamination  free zone.  Aircraft should not be used as a primary collective protection facility.  However, if used, all pressurization systems should be shut down and doors sealed if the crew finds itself in need of immediate protection. 10.3.2.3.  Hardening.    Permanent  and  expedient  hardening  measures  are  used  to strengthen  buildings  and  utility  systems  or  provide  barriers  to  resist  blast  effects.    To reduce  the  potential  of  vapor  exposure,  personnel  should  consider  the  use  of  facilities above the first floor. 10.3.3.  Contamination  Control.    In  the  post-attack  environment,  contamination  control measures  limit  the  spread  of  chemical,  biological,  and  radiological  contamination  through disease prevention measures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations. 10.3.3.1.  Disease  Prevention.    Up-to-date  immunizations,  standard  personal  hygiene practices,  and  the  use  of  chemoprophylaxis  are  effective  biological  warfare  defensive measures. 10.3.3.2.  Inflight  Decontamination.    Air  washing  is  a  useful  inflight  decontamination technique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal surfaces.  However, vapor  hazards  may  remain  in  areas  where  the  airflow  characteristics  prevent  complete off-gassing (i.e., wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and screw heads, joints, etc.).  Flights of at least  2  to  4  hours  are  recommended,  and  lower  altitudes  are  more  effective  than  higher altitudes.    Fly  with  the  aircraft  configured  (gear,  flaps,  and  slats  extended)  as  long  as possible to maximize the airflow in and around as many places as possible.  Be advised that exterior contamination may seep into the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews.  Use of ACDE is recommended. (T-2) 10.3.3.2.1.  Limits  of  Decontamination.    Complete  decontamination  of  aircraft  and equipment  may  be  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  to  achieve.    Formerly  contaminated assets  will  be  restricted  to  DOD-controlled  airfields  and  not  released  from  US government control. (T-2) 10.4.  Flight Operations. AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   71  10.4.1.  Mission Planning.  Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRN weapons.    Flight/mission  planning  must  be  thorough.    Aircraft  commanders  should emphasize  ACDE  wear,  crew  coordination,    CBRN  hazards  and  countermeasures,  inflight diversion,  plans for onload/offload in  the  event  of a  ground  attack,  and plans for the return leg  in  the  event  of  aircraft  contamination.    Alternative  scenario  plans  should  also  be considered in the event MOPP conditions change. 10.4.2.  Establishing  the  Threat  Level.    Aircrews  shall  monitor  command  and  control channels  to  ensure  they  receive  the  latest  information  concerning  the  destination's  alert condition.    Diversion  of  aircraft  to  alternate  "clean"  locations  may  be  required,  unless operational necessity otherwise dictates. (T-2) 10.4.3.  Fuel  Requirements.    Extra  fuel  is  authorized  as  needed  to  compensate  for  altitude restrictions  as  the  result  of  CB  agent  exposure.    During  purge  periods,  the  aircraft  will  be unpressurized.    Although  the  aircrew  can  use  the  aircraft  oxygen  systems,  passengers wearing  GCE  cannot,  thus  restricting  the  aircraft  cruise  altitude  and  increasing  fuel requirements accordingly. (T-2) 10.4.4.  Oxygen  Requirements.    Operating  a  contaminated  aircraft  will  increase  oxygen requirements.    Aircrew  wear  of  ACDE  will  require  use  of  the  aircraft  oxygen  system  to counter  actual/suspected  contamination.    Using  the  100  percent  oxygen  setting  offers  the greatest protection in a contaminated environment.  Appropriate oxygen quantity must be on board to meet higher consumption rates.  Use the aircraft flight manual charts to calculate the required quantity. (T-2) 10.4.5.  Donning  Equipment.    Aircrew  will  don  ACDE  based  on  the  alarm  condition  (See AFMAN  10-100).    Use  the  "buddy  dressing"  procedures.    When  wearing  the  ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors will be kept in the upper left ACDE pocket.  If the  integrated  survival  vest/body  armor  is  worn,  the  Atropine  and  2  PAM  Chloride  auto injectors  may  be  kept  in  the  lower  right  flight  suit  pocket.    This  standardized  location  will enable  personnel  to  locate  the  medication  should  an  individual  be  overcome  by  CWA poisoning.  M-9 paper on the flight suit will facilitate detection of liquid chemical agents and ACCA processing.  M-9 paper should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the CBRN threat area or when an alarm yellow or higher has been declared.  When inbound to a CBRN threat  area,  prior  to  descent,  the  aircraft  commander  will  ensure  crew  and  passengers  don appropriate  protective  equipment  IAW  arrival  destination's  MOPP  level  and  brief  aircrew operations  in  the  CBRN  threat  area.    As  a  minimum,  this  briefing  will  include:  flight  deck  isolation,  oxygen  requirements,  air  conditioning  system  requirements,  IPE  requirements, ground operations, and  MOPP levels.   Aircrew  members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival vest/body armor and LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a safety issue.  If the aircrew deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the items may be pre-positioned (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the aircrew. (T-2) 10.4.6.  Communicating Support.  Pass aircraft and cargo contamination information through command and control channels when inbound.  This information will be used to determine if a  diversion  flight  is  required  or  decontamination  teams  are  needed.    Report  the  physical condition  of  any  crew/passengers  who  are  showing  agent  symptoms  and  whether  they  are wearing chemical defense ensembles. (T-2)   72  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 10.5.  Ground Operations. 10.5.1.  Crew Rest Procedures.  Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a contaminated  environment.    If  the  mission  is  not  being  staged  by  another  aircrew  or  pre-flight crews are not available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to entering crew rest.  The departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre- flight briefings.  Then, they will report to the ACCA for processing and ACDE donning with assistance  from  ALS  personnel.    If  possible,  aircrew  transport  should  be  provided  in  a covered  vehicle.    Aircrews  should  avoid  pre-flighting  the  aircraft  prior  to  departure  to prevent  contamination  spread  to  them  and/or  the  aircraft.    As  aircrews  proceed  to  fly,  they will  require  assistance  from  ground  support  personnel  in  removing  their  aircrew  protective overcape and overboots prior to entering the aircraft. (T-2) 10.5.2.  Onload  and  Offload  Considerations.    Extreme  care  must  be  exercised  to  prevent contamination  spread  to  the  aircraft  interior  during  ground  operations,  particularly  to  the flight deck area.  Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft.  Contaminated engine covers, safety pins and chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic bags.    Aircrew  members  entering  the  aircraft  will  remove  plastic  overboots  and  overcape portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contaminants and placed  in  clean  plastic  bags.    Prior  to  entering  the  aircraft  all  personnel  should  implement boot  wash/decontamination  procedures.    Aircrew  exiting  aircraft  into  a  contaminated environment will don plastic overboots and overcape prior to leaving the aircraft. (T-2) 10.5.3.  Communications.  Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete ACDE,  complicates  communications  capability.  Use  the  mini-amplifier/speaker  or  the aircraft public address system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required. (T-2) 10.5.4.  Airlift of Retrograde Cargo.  Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from a contaminated to an uncontaminated airbase.  Critical requirements are designated in theater war plans.  Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the aircraft.  If contaminated, protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing the cargo on the aircraft.   It  is  the user's responsibility to  decontaminate  cargo  for air shipment.   The airlift  of  contaminated  or  formerly  contaminated  cargo  requires  the  approval  of  the  senior transportation commander. (T-2) 10.5.5.  Passenger/Patients.    A  path  should  be  decontaminated  between  the  aircraft  and  the ground  transportation  vehicle  to  reduce  interior  contamination  when  loading/unloading passengers/patients.    MAJCOMs  will  establish  their  own  policies  for  transportation  of externally contaminated patients and those infected with contagious biological agents. (T-2) 10.5.6.  Physiological Factors.  Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems resulting  from  physical  exertion  while  wearing  ACDE.    The  aircraft  commander  should consider factors such as ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when determining  on/offload  capabilities.    Individuals  involved  should  be  closely  monitored  for adverse physiological effects. (T-2) 10.5.7.  Work  Degradation  Factors.    Work  timetables  need  to  be  adjusted  to  minimize thermal  stress  caused  by  wearing  the  ACDE.    Aircrews  must  weigh  all  factors  when performing in- flight  and ground duties.  The following are degradation factors for wearing AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   73  full GCE, and may also  be used to represent the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE.  To estimate  how  much  time  it  takes  to  perform  a  task  or  operation,  (1)  take  the  Task  Time Multiplier (Figure 10.1) for the appropriate Work Rate and ambient air temperature and (2) multiply  it  by  the  time  it  normally  takes  to  perform  the  task.    For  example,  given  a  heavy work rate and an air temperature of 70F, the crewmember should expect a normal one hour task to take 2.1 hours while wearing ACDE.  A more extensive discussion of this subject is found in AFMAN 32-4005, Personnel Protection and Attack Actions. (T-2) Figure 10.1.  Task Time Multipliers. Work Rate Temperature   Light Moderate Heavy 20-49 F 50-84 F 85-100 F -6 to 9 C 10 to 28 C 29 to 38 C 1.2 1.3 1.7 1.4 1.4 2.1 1.5 3.0 5.0 10.5.8.  Outbound  with  Actual/Suspected  Chemical  Contamination.    Once  airborne  with actual/suspected vapor  contamination,  the aircraft  must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke and  Fume  Elimination  procedures.    To  ensure  no  liquid  contamination  exists,  a  close inspection of aircrew, passenger ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9 detection paper.  Detection paper only detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor hazards.  Above the shoulder ACDE should only be removed if there is absolutely no vapor hazard.    Be  advised  that  residual  contamination  (below  the  detectable  levels  of  currently fielded detection equipment) may  be harmful  in  an enclosed space.  The  aircrew must take every  precaution  to  prevent  spreading  of  liquid  contaminants,  especially  on  the  flight  deck area.  The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for the remainder  of  the  flight,  and  keep  the  cargo  compartments  cool.    If  an  aircrew  member  or passenger has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will stay in full ACDE/ GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area (CCA).    Upon  arrival,  the  contaminated  aircraft  will  be  parked  in  an  isolated  area  and cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground personnel. (T-2) 10.5.9.  Documenting  Aircraft  Contamination.    When  it  is  suspected  or  known  that  an aerospace  vehicle  or  piece  of  equipment  has  been  contaminated  with  a  radiological, biological or chemical contaminant, a Red X will be entered and an annotation will be made in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment. (T-2) 10.5.10.  10-Foot  Rule.    The  10-foot  rule  was  developed  in  order  to  provide  guidance  for protecting personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in locations with materials that might retain a residual chemical.  The 10-foot rule embodies a safety  factor  that  goes  beyond  current  OSD  guidance  (which  allows  removal  of  IPE whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard).  There are two phases associated with the 10-foot rule. 10.5.10.1.  Initial  Phase.    During  the  initial  phase,  personnel  will  remain  in  MOPP  4 whenever  they  stay  within  10  feet  of  the  contaminated  equipment  for  more  than  a  few   74  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 seconds.    This  MOPP  level  provides  personnel  the  maximum  protection  from  the chemical agent as it transitions from a contact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only. (T-2) 10.5.10.2.  Follow-on Phase.  In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves of a sort (i.e.  leather,  rubber,  cloth,  etc.)  when  operating  on  or  handling  the  contaminated equipment.  Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent may  still  be  present.    The  use  of  gloves  will  ensure  that  unnecessary  bare  skin  contact with agent residue is avoided. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   75  Chapter 11 NAVIGATION PROCEDURES 11.1.  Mission Planning. 11.1.1.  Flight Plan.  A pilot will cross-check the computer flight plan planned route against the  route  of  flight  entered  on  the  DD  Form  175,  Military  Flight  Plan,  or  DD  Form  1801, DoD International Flight Plan, and the approved diplomatic clearance. (T-2) 11.1.2.  RNAV(GPS)  approaches  based  on  true  or  grid  are  allowed  during  night  or  IMC provided  the  printed  RNAV(GPS)  procedure  includes  all  required  magnetic  heading information,  the  procedure  is  in  the  aircraft  database  and  all  other  normal  RNAV(GPS) requirements are met (RAIM, current database, etc.). (T-2) 11.2.  Oceanic/Class II and Extended Range Operations. 11.2.1.  Oceanic/Class  II  routing.    This  is  airspace  beyond  the  limits  of  operational  service volume of ground-based NAVAIDS. 11.2.2.  Extended  range  operations  (ETOPS).    ETOPS  is  defined  in  11-202V3  and  the glossary.  Extended range operations is in effect whenever flying a route containing a point further than 60 minutes flying time (with one-engine inoperative at maximum cruise power) from a suitable recovery airfield. (T-2) 11.2.2.1.  The PIC shall ensure enough fuel and oxygen is on board to complete the flight from the ETP to a recovery field under the worst case scenario. (T-2) 11.2.2.2.  Recovery  fields  used  for  ETP  computation  must  meet  all  alternate qualifications IAW 11-202V3 and 11-2C-12V3, to include wind limitations. (T-2) 11.2.2.3.  Any  MAJCOM  approved  computer  flight  planning  software  may  be  used  to assist in plotting an ETP and determining fuel requirements. (T-2) 11.3.  Navigational Aid Capability. 11.3.1.  Airspace  and  associated  navigational  aid  equipment  capability  are  continually evolving.  Pilots  must maintain  a thorough knowledge of current  FAA/ICAO requirements. (T-2) 11.3.2.  Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  Airspace.    Airspace  where  RVSM is  applied  is  considered  special  qualification  airspace  (FL290-FL410).    Normally,  both  the operator and the aircraft must be approved for operations in this airspace.  Refer to FLIP AP 1/2/3 for theater unique  information.  The C-12 is not currently certified/approved for flight in RVSM airspace.  However, the FAA may allow non-certified aircraft to operate in RVSM airspace in the United States under certain circumstances IAW AIM 4-6-10.  Crews must be aware of these provisions if requesting excepted operations above FL280. (T-2) 11.3.3.  Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace.  Airspace where RNP is applied is considered special qualification airspace.  RNP airspace is being incorporated around the world to increase air traffic capacity by decreasing separation requirements between routes.  Pilots  will  immediately  notify  ATC  if  any  of  the  required  equipment  fails  after  entry  into   76  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 RNP-10  airspace  and  coordinate  a  plan  of  action.    Document  in  the  aircraft  forms malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment. (T-2) 11.3.4.  RNP-10.    Navigation  accuracy  is  within  10  nm  of  track  95%  of  the  time.  Remote/Oceanic  operation  in  RNP-10  airspace  is  authorized  provided  that  all  required equipment is operational and adequate GPS coverage is available.  The GPS coverage must be checked using the Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) software prior to departure.  If the FDE software verifies satellite availability and the predicted Horizontal Integrity Limit (HIL) is  within  tolerances  for  the  airspace  (e.g.  less  than  10  NM  for  RNP-10  airspace),  then  the flight  is  authorized.    If  sufficient  satellite  coverage  for  FDE  is  not  available  or  the  HIL  is greater than airspace tolerances, then the flight is not authorized. (T-2) 11.3.5.  Basic  Area  Navigation  (BRNAV)  Airspace.    Airspace  where  BRNAV  is  applied  is considered special qualification airspace.  BRNAV meets a track keeping accuracy equal or better than +/- 5 NM for 95% of the flight time.  Minimum equipment to operate in BRNAV airspace  is  an  approved  GPS  with  Receiver  Autonomous  Integrity  Monitoring  (RAIM) provided  that  the  system  is  monitored  by  the  flight  crew  and  that  in  the  event  of  a  system failure, the aircraft retains the capability to navigate relative to ground based NAVAIDs (i.e. VOR,  DME,  and  NDB).    Pilots  will  immediately  notify  ATC  if  any  of  the  required equipment fails after entry into BRNAV airspace and coordinate a plan of action; however, with  sufficient  NAVAID  reception,  the  C-12  may  still  operate  in  the  BRNAV  airspace.  Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment. (T-2) 11.3.6.  FM  Immunity  (FMI).    The  C-12  (EFIS  modified)  is  equipped  with  dual  FMI  VHF navigation  receivers  and  is  considered  fully  compliant  with  no  restrictions.    Refer  to  the applicable Area Planning (AP) series for more information concerning FMI operations. 11.4.  Ferry Operations. 11.4.1.  For  ferry  flights,  comply  with  TO  ferry  operation  limits.    Waiver  authority  for  TO limits  is  AFMC/A3.    Route  TO  waiver  requests  thru  MAJCOM  A3  to  AFMC/A3V  for processing.  AFMC requires 3 weeks to process waiver requests. (T-2) 11.4.1.1.  Even  if  TO  weight  limit  waiver  is  approved,  all  takeoffs  above  normal  TO limits will only be done for critical legs where suitable airfields are unavailable to shorten leg length. (T-2) 11.4.2.  MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for aircraft incapable of meeting required IFR climb gradients. (T-2) 11.4.3.  Every  effort  should  be  made  to  include  a  ferry-experienced  crew  member,  and  a maintenance  member  on  ferry  mission.    If  a  ferry-experienced  crewmember  is  unavailable, the PIC must receive table top briefing from a highly experienced IP. (T-2) 11.4.4.  Comply  with  all  restrictions  and  limits  outlined  in  the  Ferry  Tank  Operations Manual. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   77  Chapter 12 AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES 12.1.  General.  This  chapter  contains  aircrew  procedures  not  contained  in  the  flight  manual, other portions of this AFI, or other publications. 12.2.  Responsibilities.  Aircrew  may  assist  the  normal  maintenance  function  when  critical contingency tasking dictate their use, provided this action does not  impact  crew  duty  and crew rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI. (T-2) 12.3.  Authority  to  Clear  a  Red  X.  Pilots  are not  normally authorized to clear  a Red X.   If  a situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are not  available  to  clear  it, the  PIC  may  obtain  authorization  to  clear  the  Red  X  from  the  owning MXG/CC or OG/CC.  Other crew members are not authorized to clear a Red X.  EXCEPTION: When  a  crew  is  required  to  run  TO  1C-12A/F/J  Strange  Field  Checklist,  the  PIC  may  clear his/her own Red X caused by securing the aircraft. (T-2) 12.4.  Aircraft Servicing.  Aircrew are authorized to perform those aircrew maintenance support tasks  found  in  this  volume.    The  aircrew  performs  these  tasks  only  in  the  absence  of  qualified maintenance  personnel  and  is  designed  for  support  of  the  aircraft  and  its  mission  while  away from home station. Without exception, the applicable checklists will be used during all refueling and de-fueling operations. (T-2) 12.4.1.  Aircraft  Refueling.    Aircrew  members  qualified  in  ground  refueling  may  perform refueling duties.  Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed. (T-2) 12.4.2.  Concurrent servicing is not authorized for C-12 aircraft. (T-2) 12.4.3.  The dash one preflight inspection will remain valid until: 12.4.3.1.  72 hours from the time of inspection; (T-2) 12.4.3.2.  Another maintenance dash six preflight inspection is performed. (T-2) 12.4.4.  Fire  Protection  and  Crash  Rescue.    A  fire  bottle,  if  available,  should  be  positioned near the front of the aircraft prior to starting engines. (T-2)   78  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 Chapter 13 CARGO AND PASSENGER PROCEDURES 13.1.  General.  A  pilot  coordinates  loading  or  offloading  with  air  terminal  operations  or  the shipping  agency;  plans  loads;  provides  in-flight  services  to  passengers;  and  supervises  on-loading or off-loading operations. (T-2) 13.2.  Responsibilities for Aircraft Loading. 13.2.1.  At  locations  with  AMC  air  terminal  facilities,  aerial  port  personnel  are  responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift, completion of documentation, preparation of cargo for air shipment, and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled departure. (T-2) 13.2.2.  At  locations  without  AMC  air  terminal  or  traffic  personnel,  the  shipper  assumes responsibilities  and  provides  sufficient  qualified  personnel  and  handling  equipment  for loading or offloading. (T-2) 13.2.3.  The PIC is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning (as required) of all cargo, preparing  weight  and  balance  documentation;  operating  aircraft  equipment;  tiedown,  and checking  the  cargo  against  manifests.    The  PIC  supervises  and  directs  on/offloading  and  is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft. (T-2) 13.3.  Emergency  Exits  and  Safety  Aisles.  No  part  of  the  cargo  load  will  extend  over  the aisle.(T-2)        NOTE: All passenger hand carried items must fit under the seat and not obstruct the aisle.  Any item that does not meet this requirement will be secured so as not to obstruct the aisle. 13.4.  Preflight Duties. 13.4.1.  Passenger  Missions.    Maximize  seat  availability.    It  may  be  necessary  for  crews  to perform  passenger  service  functions  at  stations  that  do  not  have  this  capability.    These functions include  manifesting,  anti-hijacking  processing,  and  ensuring  visa/passport requirements are met.   File a copy of the passenger manifest  with  the most  responsible on- scene  agency  if  there  is  no  base  operations  or  other  agency  responsible  for  filing  the manifest. (T-2) 13.4.1.1.  All passengers, regardless of age, are required to be assigned their own seat. (T-2) 13.4.1.2.  Passengers  are  limited  to  30  pounds  of  baggage  unless  specific  allowance  for excess baggage is pre-coordinated with the PIC.  Passengers with excess baggage may be transported  after  the  PIC  determines  the  aircraft  weight  limitations  and  mission requirements are satisfied. (T-2) 13.4.2.  Passenger may hand carry a Department of Transportation approved Infant Car Seat (ICS) aboard the aircraft to use in assigned seats.  The ICS will be secured to the seat using seat belts.  The pilot in command is the final authority in determining if the ICS is adequately secured.  Adults may hold infants under the age of two in lap for any critical phase of flight.  In the event of turbulence or an emergency landing, infants should be secured in an ICS.  (T-2)   NOTE:  Vest and harness type child restraint systems, and lap held  child restraints are not approved for use in the aircraft. (T-2) AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   79  13.4.3.  Every effort shall be made to transport passengers with disabilities who are eligible to travel.  Passenger service personnel and crewmembers will assist in loading, seating, and unloading  disabled  passengers.    Travel  may  be  disapproved  by  the  chief  of  travel  at  the passenger  travel  section  or  the  PIC  if  there  is  an  unacceptable  risk  to  the  safety  of  the disabled  passenger,  other  passengers,  crew,  or  if  operational  necessity/equipment  or manpower limitations preclude accepting disabled passengers. (T-2) 13.4.4.  Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight. (T-2) 13.4.5.  Passenger Operation of Emergency Exits.  Prior to each flight, a pilot will formulate a  passenger  emergency  egress  plan.    Only  English-speaking,  physically  able  adults  (age  15 and  older)  will  be  seated  next  to  the  emergency  exit.    The  intent  of  this  is  to  ensure  those passengers seated next to the emergency exit are aware of their duties and responsibilities in assisting the crew during emergency egress. (T-2) 13.5.  Weight  and  Balance.  Accomplish weight and balance for this aircraft according to TO 1-1B-50,  Weight  and  Balance,  and  TO  1C-12-1  procedures.

Do not carry extra fuel for convenience. (T-2) 14.3.  Fuel Planning/Management.  IAW AFI 11-202V3 and the following: 14.3.1.  Required  ramp  fuel  will  consist  of  all  fuel  required  for  engine  start,  taxi,  takeoff, climb, cruise, alternate/missed approach (if required), descent, approach, transition, landing, and  fuel  reserve  (holding  fuel).    Plan  fuel  load  using  computer  flight  plan  or  AF  Form  70, Flight  Plan,  Table  14.1,  and  the  flight  manual  (fuel  plan  not  required  on  local  missions remaining within 200 NMs). (T-2) 14.3.2.  Alternate fuel is the fuel for flight from intended destination to alternate aerodrome at optimum altitude and normal cruise speed.  Compute fuel, time, and altitude from TO 1C-12(A/F/J)-1.    When  holding  is  required  in  lieu  of  an  alternate  at  a  remote  or  island destination, compute holding IAW MAJCOM guidance, or a minimum of 1 + 15 hours using planned  destination  gross  weight  at  TO  recommended  holding  altitude.    This  provides  30 minutes  holding  fuel  in  addition  to  the  45  minute  reserve  requirement.    A  remote  or  island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which, due to its unique geographic location, offers no  suitable  alternate  (civil  or  military).    The  forecast  weather  at  the  remote  or  island destination must meet the criteria listed in Chapter 6. (T-2)   NOTE:  Additional fuel may be added  to  allow  crews  some  flexibility  when  anticipating  weather  avoidance  or  ATC  delays (T-2) Table 14.1.  Fuel Planning Chart. Fuel Load Component Fuel Requirement Start, taxi, takeoff C-12C/D/F: 90 pounds (150 with engine runup).

CHAPTER NOT USED AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   91  Chapter 20 AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION Section 20A—General Information 20.1.  Mission.  The  primary  function  of  operational  support  airlift  (OSA)  for  aeromedical evacuation (AE) is transport of ill or injured DoD members (and their dependents) requiring little or no medical support.  These AE missions may be directed at any time.  OSA aircraft will only be used with the concurrence of the appropriate theater medical validating authority. (T-2) 20.2.  Definitions. 20.2.1.  Aeromedical Evacuation (AE).  The movement of patients under medical supervision between medical treatment facilities (MTF) by air transportation. 20.2.2.  Aeromedical Evacuation Control Center (AECC).  A medical element established to operate  in  conjunction  with  command  and  control  centers  (CCC).    The  AECC  coordinates overall medical requirements with airlift capabilities and monitors patient movement. 20.2.3.  Aeromedical  Evacuation  Crew  Member  (AECM).    Qualified  flight  nurse  (FN)  or aeromedical evacuation technician (AET) performing AE duties. 20.2.4.  Charge Medical Technician (CMT).  An AET responsible for ensuring completion of enlisted medical crew duties. 20.2.5.  Global  Patient  Movement  Requirements  Center  (GPMRC).    Responsible  for coordinating  all  patient  movement  once  the  mission  arrives  at  the  CONUS  reception  aerial port,  ensuring  the  patients  are  continued  to  final  destinations  as  appropriate,  and  notifying receiving  MTFs  of  aircraft  arrival  time  as  well  as  types  and  numbers  of  patients  to  be offloaded. 20.2.6.  Medical  Crew  Director  (MCD).    An  FN  responsible  for  the  supervision  of  patient care and medical crew assigned to AE missions.  On missions where an FN is not on board, the senior AET will function as the MCD. 20.2.7.  Theater  Patient  Movement  Requirements  Center  (TPMRC).    Responsible  for  the coordination  and  requirements  for  patient  movement  from  communication  zone  (COMMZ) to CONUS. 20.3.  Deviations  and Waivers.  Waivers will process through theater C2 channels and first be approved by the medical validating authority and then the appropriate MAJCOM. (T-2) Section 20B—Aeromedical Evacuation Command and Control 20.4.  Operational  Control  (OPCON)  and  Reporting  of  Aeromedical  Forces.  OPCON  of aeromedical evacuation missions is the same as for other airlift missions. (T-2) 20.5.  Pilot in Command Responsibilities.  The PIC is responsible for ensuring the safety of the flight  and  aeromedical  crew,  patients,  and  passengers.  In  matters  concerning  flight  safety, decisions of the PIC are final.  The PIC will:   92  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 20.5.1.  Brief  the  aeromedical  crew  on  the  mission,  flight  plan,  flight  profile,  and  current threat. (T-2) 20.5.2.  Maintain cabin altitude at the level requested by the aeromedical crew. (T-2) 20.5.3.  Coordinate  with  the  MCD  or  senior  AECM  to  determine  if  any  flight  restrictions (passenger, cargo, routing) are necessary due to patient conditions. (T-2) 20.5.4.  Coordinate with the MCD or senior AECM to ensure mission-required equipment is available and installed as necessary. (T-2) 20.5.5.  Advise the AECMs of intentions to start engines, taxi, itinerary changes, or in-flight difficulties. (T-2) 20.5.6.  Transmit medical movement coordination messages. (T-2) 20.5.7.  Coordinate  crash  and  rescue  unit  requirements  when  transiting  airfields  that  are unfamiliar with AE requirements.  Crash and rescue will stand by according to AFPD 32-20, Fire  Emergency  Sevices,  and  TO  00-125-72,  Ground  Servicing  of  Aircraft  and  Static Ground/Bonding. (T-2) 20.6.  Aeromedical  Crew  Responsibilities.  The  MCD  or  senior  AECM  is  responsible  for providing medical  care to the patients.  In matters of patient care, decisions of the aeromedical crew are final.  The aeromedical crew will: 20.6.1.  Be primarily responsible for patient activities. (T-2) 20.6.2.  Assist the flight crew with aircraft AE configuration. (T-2) 20.6.3.  Install and remove medical equipment and supplies. (T-2) 20.6.4.  Control patient rests with the MCD or senior AECM. (T-2) Section 20C—Aeromedical Airlift Operations 20.7.  Determining Factors.  Consider the following factors when transporting patients on OSA aircraft: patient's diagnosis, condition,  equipment, oxygen requirements, in-flight  time, in-flight patient care requirements, and the number of medical personnel required. 20.7.1.  Patients not normally transported on OSA aircraft include: 20.7.1.1.  Patients on a Stryker turning frame.  The Stryker A frame may be carried, but is not recommended due to the difficulty in onloading or offloading on some OSA aircraft. 20.7.1.2.  Patients  with  a  high  potential  for  seizure  activity,  combativeness,  or  who require constant suctioning. 20.7.1.3.  Unstable  cardiac  patients,  cardiac  patients  requiring  a  cardiac  monitor,  and patients with a recent history of chest pains or requiring intravenous therapy en route. 20.7.1.4.  Patients  with  respiratory  problems  requiring  large  amounts  of  therapeutic oxygen, ventilator support, or frequent suctioning. 20.7.1.5.  Patients with contagious illnesses. 20.7.1.6.  High-risk neonates without special medical supervision from a neonatal team. AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015   93  20.8.  Patient  Load  Planning  Factors.  The AECC (GPMRC or TPMRC) determines size and composition of patient load on AE missions.  AE mission planning factors will be according to applicable Air Force publications. (T-2) 20.9.  Patient Preparation.  A flight surgeon, if available, will determine the patient's suitability for  aeromedical  evacuation  on  the  C-12  aircraft.    If  the  MCD  or  senior  AECM  determines  the patient's medical condition is beyond the capability of the aeromedical crew or aircraft, contact the  theater  AECC  (GPMRC  or  TPMRC)  for  further  guidance.    The  MCD  or  senior  AECM,  in coordination with the appropriate theater medical validating authority, may refuse to accept any patient  whose  medical  condition  is  beyond  their  capability.    The  MCD  or  senior  AECM  will advise  the  PIC  when  a  patient's  condition  or  use  of  medical  equipment  may  affect  aircraft operation. (T-2) 20.10.  Patient  Death  in  Flight.  When a death or suspected death of a patient occurs in flight, the planned itinerary will not be interrupted if the next scheduled stop is a military airfield.  If the next  stop  is  a  civilian  or  foreign  military  airfield,  that  stop  will  be  overflown  (mission requirements allowing).  Coordination with command and control channels is essential. (T-2) 20.11.  En Route Diversions. 20.11.1.  The MCD or senior AECM is the medical authority on board all AE missions and has the responsibility to determine what is beneficial or detrimental to the patients. (T-2) 20.11.2.  Should a diversion become necessary due to a change in patient's condition, the PIC will make every effort to comply with the requests of the MCD or senior AECM.  Establish communications  with  the  responsible  C2  which  in  turn,  will  relay  the  information  to  the appropriate AECC (GPMRC or TPMRC). 20.11.3.  Should  an  en  route  diversion  become  necessary  for  reasons  other  than  change  in patient's condition, the PIC will coordinate with the MCD or senior AECM before deciding the course of action.  Welfare of the patient is the prime consideration in all such decisions; however,  crew  and  passenger  safety  is  the  final  determinant.    The  PIC  will  notify  the responsible C2 of the diversion and requests appropriate medical agencies be notified. (T-2) 20.12.  Ground  Operations.  Engines  should  be  shut  down  during  enplaning  and  deplaning  of patients.  If possible, park aircraft so that doors used for enplaning and deplaning are upwind or on the windward side of the aircraft.  Remaining exits may be closed, but not locked. (T-2) 20.13.  Aircraft  Pressurization.  Normally,  altitude  restrictions  are  passed  from  the  AECC (GPMRC or TPMRC) to C2 channels for flight planning purposes.  The MCD or senior AECM will  advise  the  pilot  of  cabin  altitude  or  rate  of  cabin  altitude  change  restrictions  during  the preflight briefing. (T-2) 20.13.1.  Therapeutic  oxygen  is  not  available  on  the  aircraft  and  must  be  brought  on  board for patient use. (T-2) 20.14.  Aircraft  Configuration.  The  AECC  (GPMRC  or  TPMRC)  MCD  or  senior  AECM determines the size and composition  of the patient  load on board AE missions.  Load planning will be according to guidelines for the C-12 aircraft.  There are provisions for two litter patients on C-12F aircraft and five on the C-12J aircraft. (T-2)   94  AFI11-2C-12V3  16 JUNE 2015 20.15.  Passengers  and  Cargo.  With  the  concurrence  of  the  MCD  or  senior  AECM,  the  PIC will ensure maximum  aircraft usage for passengers and cargo.  Passenger restrictions based on patient considerations will be identified when seats are released. (T-2) 20.16.  Crash Coverage and Fire Protection.  Aircraft carrying patients will be provided crash and  fire  protection  according  to  AFPD  32-20.    Stand-by  is  not  necessary  during  normal operations. (T-2) 20.17.  AE Call Sign and Use of Priority Clearance.  Only use the AE priority when carrying a sick or seriously injured patient who requires urgent medical attention.  The patient need not be classified urgent. Only use AE priority for that portion of the flight requiring expedited handling.  Pilots  should  request  priority  handling  if  AE  missions  are  experiencing  long  delays  during takeoff or landing phases that will affect a patient's condition. (T-2) 20.18.  Load  Message.  At  military  bases,  the  flight  crew  will  pass  inbound  load  messages  to proper C2 personnel.  At civilian airfields, notify ground control. (T-2)  TOD D.
