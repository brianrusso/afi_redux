Note:  PAMs are required to submit both awareness certifications statements and DISA CBT certificates. 3.3.3.

Transmitting and Marking E-mail and Protecting Documents Containing PII. 4.1.  Overview.  Digitally signing and encrypting Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) are two  measures  used  to  secure  PII  for  e-mail.    Email  Encryption,  Army  Missile  Research Development  and  Engineering  Center  Safe  Access  File  Exchange  (AMRDEC  SAFE),  and DoD Encryption Wizard (EW) are more secure tools  to  use which will reduce the threat  of malicious misuse and breach of PII (see attachment 4). 4.1.1.  Do  not  disclose  personal  information  to  anyone  outside  the  DoD  unless  the information has been authorized for release. 4.1.2.  Use  document  encryption  via  AMRDEC  SAFE  or  Encryption  Wizard  (reference Attachment 4) to protect transmissions of PII approved for release and for storage of PII data at rest. 4.1.3.  Apply PII banners when transmitting information protected by the PA or FOUO. 4.1.4.  Place PII in an e-mail attachment and enable email encryption. 4.1.5.  Ensure identity validation meets release requirements. HOI33-19  25 SEPTEMBER 2015   7  4.1.6.  Validate document encryption. 4.1.7.  Retain confirmation/release information according to the RDS. 5.  Account Lockout for Digital PII Breach Incidents. 5.1.  HAF  user  accounts  may  be  locked  out  for  improperly  transmitting  unencrypted  email that contains sensitive PII.  Based on AFMAN 33-152, User Responsibilities and Guidance for  Information  Systems  (IS),  user  may  lose  network  privileges  for  conduct  that  is inconsistent  with  IA  policies  and  guidelines.    Network  lockout  includes  immediate suspension of access to unclassified and classified ISs. 5.1.1.  For  repeat  sensitive  PII  Breach  incidents,  the  violator's  account  will  be  disabled. Account lockouts are triggered by the following conditions: 5.1.1.1.  A violator causes three breach incidents within two years. 5.1.1.2.  At  Head  of  Agency-General  Officer,  Directorate”  or  Civilian  Equivalent (GO/SES) or HAFPM discretion in the event of a high visibility breach. 5.1.2.  In  the  event  of  a  lockout,  email  notification  will  be  sent  to  the  violator’s  2-Ltr Workflow  inbox  and  UPM  (or  organization  Security  Manager  when  no  UPM  is assigned). 5.2.  To restore account access, the following actions must be accomplished: 5.2.1.  Users responsible for a PII breach must complete remedial Privacy training. 5.2.2.  The  user’s  Head  of  Agency-General  Officer,  Directorate”  or  Civilian  Equivalent (GO/SES) sign reinstatement memo addressed to 844CS/CC through the HAFPM. 5.2.3.

AMRDEC  SAFE  Protection:  The  AMRDEC  SAFE  application  is  used  to  send  large files to individuals, which would normally be too large to send via email. The AMRDEC SAFE application  can  be  accessed  via  https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe/Welcome.aspx.    There  are no user accounts for SAFE - authentication is handled via email and CAC.  Everyone has access to  SAFE, and the  application is  available for use by  anyone.  There  are only a  few differences between sending SAFE packages as a CAC user and sending them as a guest: • • • Guests are required to verify their email address after uploading each package Guests cannot send packages to recipients that do not have a .mil or .gov email address CAC users can add recipients in bulk using a semicolon-delimited list. A4.1.1.  Sending  Files:  SAFE  is  designed  to  provide  AMRDEC  and  its  customers  an alternative way to send files other than email. SAFE supports file sizes up to 2GB. SAFE has received  its  Privacy  Impact  Assessment  (PIA)  and  is  authorized  for  UNCLASSIFIED  USE ONLY, TO INCLUDE PRIVACY ACT DATA. Step 1:  There are two options to proceed from the SAFE homepage: ◦Proceed as CAC User - Select this option if you have a valid US DoD-issued CAC. Proceed as Guest - Select this option if you do not have a CAC . Step 2:  After selecting one of the options above, the page will be redirected to the package upload form. Fill in all the required input fields: Name, Email address (confirm email address, re-enter email address), Description of File(s), File(s), (Click the "browse" button to select your file(s). You may add up to 25 files per package, so long as the total file size does not exceed 2GB), Deletion Date (select a date for the package to be deleted from SAFE. The maximum (which is also the default) is two weeks (14 days) from today. Provide an email address to give access to (Enter your recipient here and click "Add". CAC users may enter a semicolon-delimited list of emails in bulk so each recipient does not need to be added individually), Grant access to these people (This is the list of people you have granted access to the package. To remove a recipient, highlight their name and click the "Remove" button), Caveats (Default is "None"), Encrypt email message when possible (Attempt to encrypt the package's notification email to each recipient), Notify me when files are downloaded (You (the sender) will receive a notification via email when a recipient downloads the package), and Require CAC for pickup (Require the recipient to be logged in with a valid US DoD-issued CAC to download the file(s). Recipients without a CAC will not be able to download the package). Step 3:  Clicking the "Submit" button will upload the files and submit the package. Guest users will need to check their email to verify their email address before the recipients will be notified. No additional action is required by CAC users. Step 4:  After the package has been uploaded (and verified, if proceeding as a guest), each recipient will receive a link to the package download page as well as a password. These passwords are unique for each recipient (not the package), and will be disabled once SAFE detects that the user successfully downloaded   14  HOI33-19  25 SEPTEMBER 2015 each file within the package. Forwarding recipient and sender notification emails to anyone except the AMRDEC SAFE Team is strictly forbidden. A4.1.2.  Receiving Files: Step 1:  Recipients will automatically be notified via email when they have been added as a recipient to a package. The email they receive will contain a link and a password. Clicking on the link will take the recipient to a page where they will be asked for the password. The best way to enter the password is to copy it from the email and then paste it into the password box. Step 2:  After logging in, the recipient will be able to download all the files within the package. We recommend right-clicking on each file and selecting the "Save Target As" option to select the location to save the file to. Step 3:  After downloading every file within the package, the recipient will not be able to log back in to download the files again. Simply logging in or starting a download will not lock the user out. In order to be locked out, the recipient must successfully download every file within the package. A4.1.3.  Managing  Files:    After  uploading  a  package,  the  sender  will  receive  a  notification email  with  a  link  and  a  password.  After  accessing  the  link  and  entering  the  password,  the sender will be able to manage their package: •  Adding Files:  The sender can upload additional files to the package. Recipients will receive an additional notice email informing them that the package has been updated. Recipients who have already downloaded the package will be allowed back in to get the additional files. •  Adding Recipients:  The sender can grant access to additional recipients to the package. •  Resending Recipient Notifications:  If a recipient lost or never received their notification to pickup the files, the notification can be resent. •  Checking Recipient Status:  The list at the bottom of the status page will show each recipient and whether or not they have downloaded the package. A download status of "False" means that they have not downloaded the package, whereas a download status of "True" means that they have. This feature is available regardless of whether or not the sender selected the "Notify me" on the upload page. A4.1.4.  Encryption Wizard: Information about Encryption Wizard is found in the Help Menu, manual, and the many documents (including whitepapers) found within http://spi.dod.mil/ewizard.htm.
