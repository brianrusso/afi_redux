Office  of  the  Director,  Air  Force  History  and  Museums  Policies  and  Programs  (HQ USAF/HO).  The Director, Air Force History and  Museums Policies and Programs  coordinates the collection of historical data concerning Air Force operational activity and decision making by establishing policy concerning historical data and documentation, historical reporting, historical publications, and organizational lineage, honors, and emblems. AF/HO reviews Major Command (MAJCOM),  Direct  Reporting  Units  (DRU),  and  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOA),  Medical Service,  and  Chaplains  Corps  histories  and  their  management  of  field  history  programs.  The Director establishes policies concerning the Air Force Museums and Heritage programs. The Air Force  Historical  Studies  Office  (AF/HOH),  a  subordinate  component  of  AF/HO,  prepares  an annual  Air  Staff  history  and  collects,  preserves,  interprets,  and  disseminates  historical information  and  Air  Force  heritage,  in  part  through  the  preparation  and  production  of  a  wide range of historical publications documenting all phases of Air Force history. 1.2.  Air  Force  Historical  Research  Agency  (AFHRA).  The  Director,  Air  Force  Historical Research Agency is responsible for collecting, preserving, and disseminating Air Force historical documents.  The  Agency  maintains  a  collection  of  Air  Force  organizational  histories  and  other historical  documents,  tracks  lineage,  honors,  and  heraldry  information  for  Air  Force organizations, disseminates historical  information to  the senior leadership of the Air  Force, the Department of Defense, other government agencies, and other customers, and conducts a range of classes in support of the Air Force History Program. 1.3.  Commanders. 1.3.1.  History is an important function of command, and commanders and/or directors are an essential  part  of  maintaining  a  successful  organizational  history  program.  To  accomplish these responsibilities, commanders and/or directors will: 1.3.1.1.  Give historians access to all information (classified and unclassified) required to prepare  accurate,  objective,  and  comprehensive  historical  publications  and  records, subject  to  established  access  policies  and  procedures.  This  includes  access  to organizational  and  senior  leader  e-mail,  shared  drives,  web  sites,  and  other  sources  of information.  Commanders  ensure  history  offices  are  equipped  with  non-secure  internet protocol  router  network  (NIPRNET)  terminals  and  have  secret  internet  protocol  router network  (SIPRNET)  access  or  terminals  and  a  Government  Services  Agency  (GSA)-approved security container (T-0).  For units without a wartime and/or classified mission, commanders  ensure  history  offices  have  access  to  classified  (SIPRNET)  network  and access to a GSA-approved security container as required. 1.3.1.2.  Ensure  their  historians  have  adequate  office  space  and  resources  necessary  to maintain and protect historical documents, to research paper and electronic files (software and hardware), to provide research assistance to the staff. (T-3) 1.3.1.3.  Participate  in  periodic  interviews  with  the  historian  (at  least  once  annually)  so that  the  historian  can  capture  the  commander’s  perspective  on  issues  of  historical significance. Also, commanders participate in an end-of-tour interview. (T-3) AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 5 1.3.1.4.  Review and sign the unit history within 30 days of submission of the final draft to the command section. (T-3) 1.3.1.5.  The  historian’s  primary  duty  is  completing  periodic  annual  history  reports; commanders will ensure historians are not assigned additional duties which interfere with that work. (T-3) 1.3.1.6.  Ensure  historians  assigned  to  Emergency  Essential  (EE)  deployable  positions meet  medical,  physical,  and  training  requirements  for  deployable  positions.  (T-1).  Take appropriate action when employees no longer meet identified requirements. 1.3.1.7.  Ensure  historians  attend  training  and  Air  Force  history  conferences  and symposiums as required. (T-3) 1.4.  Field  Organizations.  Air  Force  organizations  perform  history  functions  consistent  with AFI  38-101,  Air  Force  Organization.  This  includes  preparing  a  periodic  organizational  history that documents significant issues and activities affecting the unit. History offices are staffed  by qualified personnel who report directly to the commander, vice commander, or director of staff. 1.4.1.  Air Force Historians at all levels will: 1.4.1.1.  Prepare periodic history reports (RCS: HAF-HO (A) 7101). Completion of these reports is the historian’s primary mission responsibility. (T-1) 1.4.1.2.  Submit  Semiannual  Historical  Activity  Reports  (RCS:  HAF-HO  (SA)  8202)  to the parent MAJCOM or AF/HO, as appropriate. (T-1) 1.4.1.3.  Provide historical  research  and reference services in  support of  the  commander and staff, and answer other requests for historical information. (T-1) 1.4.1.4.  Coordinate  on  unit  emblem  requests  and  monitor  unit  lineage  and  honors information.  See  AFI  84-105,  Organizational  Lineage,  Honors,  and  Heraldry  and  AFI 34-1201, Protocol. (T-1) 1.4.1.5.  Obtain and maintain a Top Secret clearance. (T-1) 1.4.1.6.  Maintain a collection of historical documents and reference materials, including a complete file of the organization’s periodic histories. (T-1) 1.4.1.7.  Establish  and  maintain  contingency  plans  for  preservation  and  recovery  of historical archives and heritage assets. Component-MAJCOM (C-MAJCOM), FOA, and DRU History Offices send copies of these plans to AF/HO.  Numbered Air Force (NAF), Center, Wing, and Group History Offices send a copy of their plans to the respective C-MAJCOM History Office. (T-1) 1.4.1.8.  Prepare heritage pamphlets, studies, and other historical products. (T-1) 1.4.1.9.  Provide  historical  documents  and  other  materials  to  support  historical  exhibits and  displays.    Historians  may  serve  as  advisers,  but  the  historian  will  not  have  primary responsibility for exhibits and displays. (T-3) 1.4.1.10.  Ensure  newly-hired  civilian  historians,  writer/editors,  archivists  attend  and complete the Historian Training Course conducted by the AFHRA no later than one year from the date of their entry into the AFHMP. (T-1)  Other AFHMP personnel may attend as required. 6 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 1.4.1.11.  Officer  and  enlisted  historians  will  follow  current  Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air Force  Career  Field  Manager  directives  for  required training  and  professional development/ 1.4.2.  Major Command History Offices (MAJCOM/HOs) will: 1.4.2.1.  Monitor  the  status  of  the  subordinate  unit  history  programs.

Establish  requirements  and  procedures  for  providing  historical  services  and collecting  historical  documentation  at  subordinate  organizations.  In  conjunction  with MAJCOM  manpower  officials,  MAJCOM/HOs  determine  if  subordinate  organizations need  full-time  historians.  If  required,  submit  requests  through  manpower  channels  as described in Air Force Manpower Standard 101A, following coordination with AF/HO. 1.4.3.  Direct Reporting Units (DRU) and Field Operating Agencies (FOA) reporting directly to Headquarters USAF will: 1.4.3.1.  Establish  and  maintain  history  offices  as  separate,  special  staff  agencies  with qualified personnel who have direct access to commanders or directors. (T-1). 1.4.3.2.  If  circumstances  warrant,  establish  procedures  to  collect  historical  information from geographically-separated subordinate organizations. (T-2). AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 7 1.4.3.3.  FOAs  without full-time  historians  appoint  additional  duty  historians. Commanders  or  directors  send  names,  office  addresses,  and  phone  numbers  of  these individuals to AF/HO, which establishes reporting guidelines. (T-1). 8 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 2 HISTORICAL PUBLICATIONS AND SERVICES 2.1.  Purpose  of  Air  Force  History.  Air  Force historical  products  provide objective, accurate, descriptive,  and  interpretive  accounts  of  Air  Force  operations  in  peace  and  war.  Accurate  and timely  historical  reporting  provides  decision-makers  with  information  they  can  use  to  improve the combat capability of the United States Air Force and the Department of Defense. 2.1.1.  Products.  The  primary  product  of  Air  Force  unit  historians  is  the  periodic  history report. Historians also prepare various types of publications, papers, and other products that preserve an official record of Air Force operations, make information available to decision-makers and action officers, provide reference material for researchers, promote awareness of Air Force heritage, and support Professional Military Education (PME). 2.1.2.  Periodic  history  reports  are  produced,  distributed,  and  preserved  electronically. Exceptions  to  this  policy  (that  is,  paper-based  periodic  histories)  are  coordinated  with  the parent  MAJCOM  history  office  or  equivalent.  Other  historical  products  may  be  distributed electronically  or  in  paper  format.  Only  standard  Air  Force  licensed  software  is  used  to produce these products. 2.2.  Periodic  History  Report.  The  periodic  history  report  represents  the  official  Air  Force effort  to  preserve  information  in  a  complete  and  systematic  manner  for  future  research  and reference. A typical historical report consists of prescribed front matter, a narrative, appendices, and  supporting  documents.  The  front  matter  covers  a  variety  of  administrative  topics  and includes a chronology that lists, by date, key mission-related operational activities The narrative describes and analyzes events based on the historians’ knowledge and understanding of the unit and  its  mission.  The  appendices  summarize  statistical  and  organizational  data  in  a  concise  and consistent  format.  The  supporting  documents  substantiate  topics  and  statistics  included  in  the entire  history.    Periodic  history  reports  serve  as  the  institutional  memory  of  Air  Force organizations. 2.2.1.  Each organization with a full-time historian prepares periodic history reports. Prepare reports in accordance with policies and procedures outlined in Chapter 4. 2.2.2.  Periodic  History  Reports  (RCS:  HAF-HO  (A)  7101).  The  standard  submission  cycle for periodic history reports is 12 months. Organizations may use either calendar or fiscal year cycles.  MAJCOMs,  FOAs,  and  DRUs  advise  AF/HO  of  the  submission  cycle  selected  for their command’s annual history report. MAJCOMs may specify alternate submission cycles for subordinate units and organizations. 2.2.2.1.  The  historian  must  submit  the  history  report  for  signature  by  the  commander, vice commander, or director of staff not later than 30 April for fiscal year reports and 31 July  for  calendar  year  reports  (see  Table  2.1).  (T-2)  The  report  is  considered  official when the Commander, Vice Commander, or Director of Staff signs it. AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 9 Table 2.1.  Submission Milestones.

AF/HO  may  adjust  the  coverage  period  and  due  date  of  periodic  history  reports  for MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs. Requests for adjustments need to be submitted no later than 30  days  prior  to  original  due  date  and  signed  by  the  organization  commander,  vice commander, or director of staff. 2.2.4.  MAJCOM/HOs  may  adjust  the  coverage  period  and  due  date  of  subordinate  unit reports  based  on  command  or  individual  needs.  Wing  request  for  adjustments  to  due  dates will be dated no later than 30 days prior to original due date and signed by the organization Commander, Vice Commander, or Director of Staff. (T-2). MAJCOM/HOs issue automatic extensions for contingency-related and formal training TDYs. 2.3.  Heritage  Pamphlets.  Unit members are the primary audience for these brief, unclassified historical  accounts  of  an  organization.  All  organizations  with  full-time  historians  assigned produce  these  pamphlets.  Be  sure  to  include  an  “as  of”  date.  Submit  the  draft  pamphlet  to AF/HO  or  the  MAJCOM/HO  as  appropriate  for  review.  Make  corrections,  if  needed,  and  then the  historian  must  send  the  pamphlet  to  Public  Affairs  for  security  and  policy  review  before making any distribution to determine its suitability for public release (See AFI 35-102, Security and  Policy  Review  Process).  (T-2)  These  pamphlets  are  updated  at  least  annually  or  more frequently  if  necessary.  Historians  will  follow  local  procedures  for  posting  the  pamphlet  on organizational web sites and send one electronic copy to the AFHRA. (T-2). 2.4.  Studies.  Air  Force  historians  at  all  levels  research  and  write  a  variety  of  classified  and unclassified  historical  products,  analyzing  significant  issues,  policies,  operations,  programs, developments,  doctrine,  procedures,  or  comparable  topics.  AF/HOH  is  the  program’s  clearing house for all historical publications. Historians will report the status of local writing projects to HOH whenever such projects are begun or completed, via the parent MAJCOM/HO. (T-1) 2.4.1.  These products can vary widely in length and format depending on the topic covered and  intended  audience.  Ensure  in-depth  narrative  studies  of  significant  topics  provide thorough  source  citations  for  the  information  presented  and  include  many  of  the  same features and  components used in  the preparation  of periodic history  reports.  In some cases, extensive studies on topics of general interest may be published as books, if unclassified and cleared  for  public  release  by  public  affairs.    In  addition  to  lengthy  and  fully  documented narrative  examinations  of  a  topic,  historical  studies  can  also  take  the  form  of  chronologies, technical  reports,  statistical  analyses,  bibliographical  essays,  and  annotated  document collections.  10 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 2.4.2.  While  the  periodic  history  report  remains  the  Air  Force  historian’s  primary  product, historians  at  wings,  centers,  and  other  subordinate  organizations  also  produce  studies  on topics  within  their  unit’s  purview  having  potential  long-range  historical  significance.  All history offices must coordinate proposed studies and final drafts with AF/HOH. (T-1) 2.4.3.  Distribute  final  products  as  widely  as  legally  permissible,  contingent  on  the  subject and  classification.  Utilize  Freedom  of  Information  (FOIA)  electronic  reading  rooms  when available. Before distribution or release to members of the public, submit final manuscripts to the appropriate Public Affairs office for security and policy review in accordance with AFI 35-102,  Security  and  Policy  Review  Process.  MAJCOM/HOs  must  approve  distribution outside  of  originating  wings  and  centers.  Send  a  final  digital  copy,  complete  with  digital supporting  documents,  to  AF/HOH  and  the  AFHRA.    If  a  complete  digital  copy  is  not produced,  send  one  paper  copy  complete  with  paper  supporting  documents.  Do  not  mix digital  and  paper  formats.  Submit  studies  on  technical  subjects  to  the  Defense  Technical Information  Center  (DTIC)  in  accordance  with  AFI  61-202,  USAF  Technical  Publications Program. 2.5.  Interviews.  There are two types of interviews conducted and used by Air Force historians: formal Oral History interviews and research interviews. 2.5.1.  Air  Force  Oral  History  Interviews.  This  program  captures  the  insights  and perspectives of significant Air Force personnel via a process that includes prior coordination, a full transcript, and an assignment of rights. 2.5.1.1.  Unit  historians  must  coordinate  proposed  formal  Air  Force  Oral  History interviews with their respective MAJCOM/HO, which then forwards the proposal to the AFHRA,  which  in  turn,  requests  approval  from  AF/HO.  (T-1)  AF/HO  is  the  final approval authority for these formal Oral History interviews. 2.5.1.2.  If the individual providing the oral history is not currently an active duty military member,  Air  Reserve  Component  member  on  Title  10  orders,  or  federal  government civilian employee, the individual assigns rights to the oral history, in whatever format it is preserved,  to  the  Air  Force  and  is  given  a  copy  of  the  agreement  before  the  individual dictates his/her comments. Air Reserve Component personnel not in a Title 10 status and foreign participants also sign this form. (See Attachment 15.). 2.5.1.3.  Formal  Oral  Histories  conducted  by  Air  Force  historians  must  contain  the following statement on either the title page or the first page of the transcript: (T-1). 2.5.1.3.1.  “The  opinions  and  facts  expressed  in  this  interview  are  those  of  the speaker.  These  comments  have  been  transcribed  as  they  were  recorded  during  the interview.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  no  attempt  has  been  made  to  check  or  correct dates and other facts mentioned by the subject. The opinions are those of the subject and do not necessarily represent those of the United States Air Force or the Air Force History and Museums Program.” 2.5.1.4.  Historians will send transcripts and the audio or video recordings to the AFHRA for inclusion in the Air Force Oral History collection. (T-1).  AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 11 2.5.2.  Research  Interviews.  These  interviews  are  in  support  of  periodic  history  reports  and other  research.  They  can  take  the  form  of  traditional  recorded  and  transcribed  interview, telephone  conversations,  electronic  exchanges,  or  brief,  informal,  face-to-face  discussions. Historians  normally  ensure  summaries  or  transcriptions  of  interviews  are  signed  by  the subject  and  included  as  a  supporting  document  in  the  periodic  history.  Historians  must prepare  summaries  that  identify  the  subject  of  the  interview,  the  date  and  location  of  the interview,  the  topic(s)  discussed,  and  a  description  of  the  subject  matter  discussed  or recorded.  (T-1)  If  the  subject  matter  discussed  is  classified,  historians  will  ensure  these interviews include appropriate “Classified by:” and “Declassify on:” instructions, all required administrative markings, and appropriate portion markings. (T-0). 2.6.  Books  .  Historians  usually  publish  these  major  projects  through  the  Government  Printing Office (GPO) or its designated office or representative only after a thorough review process and professional  editing.  The  GPO  is  now  publishing  fewer  paper  products  and  more  e-books. Electronic  publication  of  special  studies  is  strongly  encouraged  as  an  efficient  way  of disseminating  historical  information  to  a  wide  audience.  Electronically  published  studies  and monographs undergo the same rigorous review and editing as those products published in print. In some cases, field historians may publish books locally, usually in cooperation with nonprofit organizations.  Prior  to  initiating  such  projects,  historians  must  coordinate  proposals  with  the Director, AF/HOH via the parent MAJCOM/HO. (T-1). 2.7.  Articles,  Book  Reviews,  and  Papers.  Members  of  the  Air  Force  History  and  Museums Program  may  write  articles,  book  reviews,  and  papers  for  Air  Force  and  non-Air  Force publications. However, 5 C.F.R. 2635.807(b) only permits the use of official titles and positions as one of several biographical details when authoring materials in a nonofficial capacity. Use of official  titles,  such  as  Air  Force  historian,  in  these  instances  incorrectly  implies  Air  Force endorsement of the product and is prohibited. Therefore, members of the AFHMP who publish in non-DoD professional  and scientific publications may  otherwise only use their official  titles or positions  when  the  writing  is  accompanied  by  an  appropriate  DoD  disclaimer,  unless  they  are authorized to state the official position of the Air Force on such matters. 2.7.1.  Historians  at  all  levels  should  take  every  opportunity  to  prepare  background  papers, talking  papers,  and  similar  products  on  historical  topics  of  interest  to  senior  leaders.  For formats, see AFH 33-337, Tongue and Quill, and follow local procedures as appropriate. 2.7.2.  When  publishing  material,  historians  must  submit  material  for  security  and  policy review  well  in  advance  of  possible  publication.  (T-0)  See  AFI  35-102,  Security  and  Policy Review. 2.8.  Oral  Presentations  and  Visual  Information.  Historians  may  make  presentations  to audiences interested in  Air Force history and heritage. Examples of these projects  may include briefings, tours, staff rides, videos, and PME presentations. 2.9.  Exhibits.  These  projects  foster  an  appreciation  of  the  Air  Force’s  heritage  and  the organization’s  history.  Historians  assist  project  officers  by  researching  and  writing  historical commentary,  as  well  as  gathering  photographs  and  other  materials.  See  AFI  84-103,  US  Air Force Heritage Program.  12 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 2.10.  Electronic  Reference  Library  .  Depending  on  local  policies  and  procedures,  historians may post historical reference material on unit web sites, shared drives, or Enterprise Information Management (EIM). Material intended for public access  needs to  be cleared through a security and policy review before it is posted or otherwise released. Historians contact the Public Affairs office to begin the review process. 2.11.  Requests  for  Information  .  Historians  serve  a  variety  of  customers,  but  none  more important than their commander and senior leadership. Historians track each request, accounting for the time spent researching and providing the answer. Include administrative time, such as the time spent traveling to the base library, or coordinating the response with other staff agencies, or contacting other repositories. 2.12.  Medical and Chaplain Historical Reports. 2.12.1.  Under  the  guidance  and  direction  of  the  Office  of  the  Surgeon  General  (AF/SG), MAJCOM  surgeons  assign  qualified  medical  service  personnel  to  prepare  annual  Medical Historical  Reports  (RCS:  HAF-HO(A)7102)  on  medical  administrative  and  professional activities.  The  command  surgeon  signs  the  report.  The  Historian,  Air  Force  Medical Operations  Agency  (AFMOA)  establishes  reporting  procedures.  MAJCOM/HOs  are  not responsible for and are not involved in researching, compiling, or editing medical historical reports. 2.12.2.  The  Chief  of  Chaplains  (AF/HC)  provides  policy  and  direction  through  chaplain channels  for  preparing  periodic  histories  defining  the  significant  developments  and contributions of the Chaplain Corps to the Air Force’s operational effectiveness. 2.13.  Retention  and  Disposition  of  Historical  Records.  Use  procedures  in  AFI  33-364, Records Disposition Procedures and Responsibilities, to retain and dispose of historical records. Follow the disposition schedule located within the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). 2.14.  Collecting  Historical  Artifacts,  Personal  Papers,  and  Other  Material.  If  a  collection of  personal  papers  or  documentary  material  of  potential  historical  value  becomes  available, historians contact  the AFHRA via the MAJCOM/HO. The AFHRA assesses the collection and provides  further  instructions  on  the  disposition  of  the  material.  For  historical  artifacts,  consult AFI 84-103, US Air Force Heritage Program. AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 13 Chapter 3 HISTORICAL ACTIVITY REPORTS 3.1.  Semiannual  Historical  Activity  Report  (HAR).  The  HAR  documents  accomplishments and contributions by each headquarters and field history office and the AFHRA. HQ USAF/HO uses these reports to provide data to the Air Force leadership on the entire history program. Also, MAJCOM History Offices use this data to assist in the annual history awards program; therefore, historians  at  the  wing/NAF  level  should  ensure  their  reports  provide  a  detailed  and  accurate accounting of their historical services and other activities. 3.2.  MAJCOMs,  DRUs,  FOAs  and  the  AFHRA  .    MAJCOM,  DRU,  FOA  History  Offices and the AFHRA must submit the semiannual HAR (RCS: HAF-HO (SA) 8202) electronically to AF/HO  by  1  August  (covering  the  period  1  January-30  June)  and  1  February  (covering  the period  1  July-31  December).  (T-1).  Centers,  laboratories,  wings,  and  groups  must  submit  the semiannual  HAR  electronically  to  their  MAJCOM.  Reserve  Component  historians  will  follow specific guidance from AFRC/HO. (T-1). 3.2.1.  Historians will prepare the historical activity report using the format in the following paragraphs. (T-1). Enter N/A when items do not apply. 3.2.1.1.  Report  the  inclusive  dates  of  the  last  history  submitted  to  the  AFHRA  by  the unit/organization. 3.2.1.2.  Report the date the last history report was submitted to the AFHRA. 3.2.1.3.  Report  the  inclusive  dates  of  the  history  or  histories  in  progress  at  the  unit  or organization as of the closing date of this historical activity report. 3.2.1.4.  Report the established due date of the next scheduled submission. 3.2.1.5.  Provide  a  realistic  assessment  of  the  organization’s  ability  to  meet  this submission date. This is the opportunity to highlight any issues that may delay the timely completion of the next historical report. 3.2.2.  Participation in AEF deployments, exercises, operations, or contingency deployments. Include  type  (joint,  combined,  Air  Force,  MAJCOM,  or  local),  who  deployed  and  where, name of exercise, operation, or contingency operation, deployment dates, and types of reports submitted, dates submitted, and to whom. 3.2.3.  Number  of  information  requests  processed  during  the  period  that  required  historical research  or  knowledge.  Report  the  amount  of  time  spent  on  these  requests.  Break  out statistics  by  quarter  so  that  AF/HO  can  compile  and  present  data  in  fiscal  year  or  calendar year format as required. 3.2.4.  Most  significant  information  requests,  services,  or  contributions  made  during  the period.  Include  the  customer,  type  of  product/support  provided,  date  of  request,  date  of delivery, and an assessment of the value of the project. 3.2.5.  The number of requests and the total amount of time spent responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. 14 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 3.2.5.1.

Historian Responsibilities 4.1.1.  The  primary  mission  of  Air  Force  historians  at  all  levels  is  to  record  the  history  of their  assigned  unit  or  organization.  Air  Force  historians  accomplish  this  by  preparing periodic historical reports that focus on the operations, however defined, of the reporting unit or organization. 4.1.2.  An  Air  Force  Historian  must  be  able  to  work  successfully  with  others.  Experience may  not  be  as  important  as  enthusiasm.  However,  certain  basic  characteristics  are  highly desirable  in  all  Air  Force  historians.  The  historian  should  have  enough  native  curiosity  to want to know what is happening in the unit, and enough initiative to go out and get the facts. The historian should be constantly alert for new sources of information. The historian should be enthusiastic, tactful, and discrete, attributes that enable him or her to enjoy the confidence of other Airmen. 4.2.  Historical Research and Sources. 4.2.1.  Historical  Source  Material.  Most  information  in  a  historical  report  comes  from  a variety of source documents, augmented by interviews. In most cases, source materials which come directly from  a participant in  an event  are  usually more reliable than materials  which originate  with  persons  farther  removed  from  the  same  event.  The  former  materials  are defined  as  "primary"  and  the  latter  are  called  "secondary"  materials.  Typical  examples  of primary  materials  are  orders,  messages,  minutes  of  meetings,  and  correspondence (memoranda,  e-mails,  etc.).      Typical  examples  of  secondary  materials  are  newspaper accounts and magazine articles. The historian must select, analyze, and evaluate documents with great care and not waste time on documents with only marginal utility. 4.2.2.  Conducting Historical Research. 4.2.2.1.  Historians build the documentary collection on which their historical reports are based  by  conducting  comprehensive  and  continuing  research  at  a  unit’s  critical information  collection  points.  Understanding  an  organization’s  mission  and  structure  is the  key  to  identifying  these  collection  points,  whether  they  are  physical  offices  like Command Posts or on-line repositories like organizational shared drives. Historians visit these  data  centers  regularly  to  ensure  vital  documentation  is  preserved  and  not  deleted, either  as  a  matter  of  policy  or  accidentally.  These  visits  also  enable  the  historian  to establish personal contacts with unit personnel that can greatly facilitate further research efforts. 4.2.2.2.  Historians  constantly  develop  new  sources  of  information  because  research needs  vary  from  historical  report  to  historical  report.  Historian  interaction  with information owners ensure that, as new sources of information are found, the historian is given  access  to  the  material.  Such  contacts  enable  the  historian  to  identify  additional leads that may open up even more sources of information. 16 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 4.2.2.3.  By becoming a visible and respected member of their unit, historians at all levels establish  and  maintain  relationships  that  demonstrate  their  professional  competence  and the value of their work to the organization. Experience has shown that such face-to-face interaction can significantly enhance the ability of the historian to accomplish his or her mission.  A  successful,  continuing  research  effort  in  an  organization  is  contingent  upon the  historian  establishing  relationships  based  on  mutual  trust  and  respect  with  the organization’s  leadership  and  those  who  generate  and  maintain  the  information  the historian needs to build an accurate, comprehensive historical report. 4.2.2.4.  When conducting historical research, historians consider the following issues: 4.2.2.4.1.  Historians are afforded a unique, leadership-level view of a broad range of unit  activities.  Historians  use  this  perspective  to  determine  what  information  is worthy of inclusion in a historical report. Select topics and documents with potential long-term  value  based  on  the  organization’s  mission,  the  historian’s  professional judgment,  suggestions  by  the  commander  and  staff,  and  feedback  from  higher headquarters evaluations. 4.2.2.4.2.  In the narrative and supporting documents, emphasize events affecting the people  who  make  history.  An  organization’s  history  reflects  the  activities  of  people working individually  and collectively to  accomplish  the organization’s mission. The history documents the mission and how the organization’s people accomplished that mission. Also consider key decisions that affected the organization and the decision-making  process,  events  and  the  actions  of  outside  agencies  that  influenced  the organization’s  activities,  and  the  organization’s  execution  of  higher  headquarters policies and directives. 4.2.2.4.3.  Historians have access to far more information than they normally need to write historical products. Historians carefully review this mass of data to select only the most relevant documents. For example, if a report prepared on the last day of the month contains information from the rest of the month, preserve only that last report, not the full set of 30 or 31 daily reports. However, historians should review the daily reports to ensure that they do not contain detailed information absent from subsequent reports or summaries. 4.2.3.  Sources of Information. 4.2.3.1.  The following paragraphs describe the various types of documents typically used to  build historical  reports. The list  is  not  all-inclusive. Successful historians incorporate new sources of information into their document collection as they identify these sources. The  easiest  way  to  collect  these  documents  is  to  have  the  originating  office  add  the History Office to their normal distribution list. However, “automatic distribution” is not a substitute for regular contact with unit’s information owners. 4.2.3.2.  Publications:  Air  Force  policy  and  mission  directives  (AFPD  and  AFMD), instructions  (AFI),  and,  in  particular,  local  supplements  to  AFIs  affecting  the  mission, organization, and operations of the unit. Review them frequently for changes.  AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 17 4.2.3.3.  Orders:  Military  headquarters  direct  and  authenticate  changes,  actions,  or procedures  through  various  types  of  orders.  Review  all  G-series  special  orders  for possible use. Such knowledge helps you locate critical documentation, since these orders are  issued  by  various  offices.    G-series  orders  are  included  as  the  first  supporting document in the history. 4.2.3.4.  Correspondence:  Review  paper  correspondence,  e-mails  and  attachments,  and comparable communications within and between organizations and personnel. Historians require access to e-mail files, organizational shared drives, web sites, and other sources of information. 4.2.3.5.  Reports and Studies: Staff studies (point papers, memoranda for the record, staff summary  sheets,  briefings,  talking  papers,  etc.)  are  of  special  interest  to  historians because  they  often  precede  and  form  the  basis  for  significant  decisions.  Include  unit assessments  and  reports  of  inspections,  tests,  audits,  exercises,  operations,  and  trip reports.  Include  as  a  supporting  document  in  the  periodic  history  an  end-of-tour  report prepared  by  a  departing  commander,  if  available.  It  relates  a  unique  perspective  on  the commander’s major challenges, issues, accomplishments, problems, and lessons learned. 4.2.3.6.  Statistics  and  Graphics:  Include  organizational  charts,  station  lists,  order  of-battle information, maps, manning documents, sortie data, air tasking orders, etc. Again, this  list  is  not  all-inclusive.  These  documents  are  indispensable  components  of  periodic historical reports. Put the data in the narrative or in an appendix as appropriate; save the source itself as a supporting document. 4.2.3.7.  Meetings:  Historians  attend  staff  meetings,  briefings,  planning  sessions,  and policy-making  gatherings as a way to  gain  familiarity with  the organization’s activities, increase  their  visibility,  establish  contacts,  and  build  relationships  with  unit  members. Notes taken by the historian during these meetings can be used as supporting documents. 4.2.3.8.  Research  Interviews:  A  participant  in  an  Air  Force  activity  can  be  a  valuable source  of  historical  information.  Comments  obtained  from  a  person  supplement  the documentary  record,  fill  in  gaps  which  commonly  appear  in  the  written  record,  offer reasons for and explanations of the factual material found in documents, give an insight into the problems and aims of the commander and other key personnel, and provide the historian with first-hand accounts and experience not found in formal records. Interviews should be held as soon as possible after the event, while the facts are still clear. See also para 2.5.2 for additional guidance. 4.2.3.8.1.  The success of an interview depends in large measure on the preparations made for it and the manner in which the interviewer conducts it. The best results are achieved if the interviewer has made careful advanced preparations. He or she should know  as  precisely  as  possible  what  kind  of  information  is  needed  and  have  a  solid grasp of the background of events, missions, orders, decisions, problems, and the like. Nothing  is  so  impressive  to  a  person  being  interviewed  as  the  perception  that  he  or she  is  being  questioned  by  someone  who  has  a  comprehensive  and  detailed knowledge of the situation. A more specific question yields a more specific answer.  18 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 4.2.3.8.2.  Interviews  (such  as  an  annual  interview  with  the  unit  commander,  which does  not  require  prior  coordination  with  AF/HO  etc.)  are  transcribed  and  signed  by the  interview  subject.  In  addition  to  the  transcript,  submit  the  audio  files  in  MP3, WAV  or  WMA  format  as  a  supporting  document  in  the  history.  If  extraordinary circumstances preclude the preparation of a full transcript, submit the audio file and include a time-to-topic index or a detailed summary of the  content of the interview, which  is  also  authenticated  by  the  interviewee.  Informal  interviews,  such  as  a  brief conversation  with  a  crew  chief  or  a  staff  officer,  may  be  documented  by  historian notes or simply cited in footnotes. 4.2.3.8.3.  Conduct a formal interview with the organization’s commander or director at least once during each reporting period to gain his or her perspective. 4.2.4.  Contingency and Wartime Data: Collect and record detailed data and comprehensive documentation  during  wartime  and  contingency  operations.  Such  research  is  the  highest priority  for  historians  in  operational  units  and  headquarters.  This  effort  is  critical  to  later historical  analysis,  research,  and  writing.  See  AFI  84-102,  Historical  Operations  in Contingency and War, for guidance on wartime and contingency historical requirements and reporting procedures. 4.2.5.  Historians  normally  do  not  collect  subordinate  unit  feeder  reports  or  use  them  as supporting  documents  in  their  historical  reports.  However,  in  some  instances  these  feeder reports  may  be  the  only  source  of  information  obtainable  from  some  geographically-separated  units  or  locations.  In  these  cases,  AF/HO  or  the  MAJCOM  (as  appropriate)  must approve the collection and use of these reports. AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 19 Chapter 5 SELECTING TOPICS AND ORGANIZING AND WRITING THE PERIODIC HISTORICAL REPORT 5.1.  How to Begin.  The best source of guidance on the content of your next history is the table of  contents  of  your  unit’s  last  history,  assuming  the  program  is  relatively  current.  The  table  of contents shows what  was considered important  when that history  was prepared. Based on  your research and on your knowledge of your unit’s mission, organization, and recent activities, you can delete topics that are no longer relevant and add new topics that have come up. Throughout this process, remember: your outline drives your research and your research drives your outline. Your evolving table of contents, which is,  in effect,  your outline, is  highly  flexible and  can be changed  to  reflect  new  issues  and  events  as  they  unfold.  Then,  review  and  apply  feedback provided in formal assessments of prior history reports. Finally, consider recommendations from the  commander,  staff,  unit  members,  and  others  who  have  used  the  history.  Then,  establish  a systematic  method  of  filing  and  referencing  research  material  as  it  arrives.  Historians  use  a variety of filing systems, such as topical, subject, chapter, office, etc., rather than one based on subordinate  organizations  or  by  date.    Add  or  delete  topics  as  research  and  writing  progresses. Besides  using  these  files  as  the  basis  of  your  supporting  document  collection,  they  can  be valuable reference aids for answering inquiries about recent events. 5.2.  Topic Selection  . All issues and topics affecting the organization come under the purview of  the  organization’s  historian,  but  only  significant  activities  merit  discussion  in  the  periodic history.  To  determine  significance,  always  focus  on  the  organization’s  mission  and  how  the organization’s  people  worked  collectively  to  accomplish  that  mission.  For  example,  unit participation  in  an  exercise  or  deployment  merits  more  coverage  than  a  unit  picnic  or  social event. Topics listed below are general and intended as guides. The list is not all-inclusive, nor is it in any rank order. 5.2.1.  Mission, Organization, and Key Personnel. 5.2.1.1.  Operational Activity. 5.2.1.2.  Flying Hours and Sortie Data. 5.2.1.3.  Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS). 5.2.1.4.  Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS). 5.2.1.5.  Relationships with other organizations. 5.2.1.6.  Planning. 5.2.1.7.  Training. 5.2.1.8.  Maintenance and Logistics. 5.2.1.9.  Communications and Information Technology. 5.2.1.10.  Environment. 5.2.1.11.  Facilities. 5.2.1.12.  Community (and host nation, if applicable) relations. 20 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 5.2.1.13.  Budget (funds availability, effect of shortfalls, etc.). 5.2.1.14.  Personnel (authorized, assigned, etc.). 5.2.1.15.  Mission Support (Security Forces, Civil Engineers, Force Support, etc). 5.2.2.  MAJCOM/HOs, in their supplements to this AFI, may mandate a range of topics to be covered in the histories of their subordinate organizations. They may also require appendices in  addition  to  these  mandatory  appendices,  which  historians  must  include  in  all  Air  Force historical reports: (T-1). 5.2.2.1.  Appendix A, Lineage and Honors data. 5.2.2.2.  Appendix B, Roster of Key Personnel. 5.2.2.3.  Appendix C, Personnel Statistics (authorized and assigned). 5.2.2.4.  Appendix D, Organizational Structure. 5.2.3.  It  is  important  that  topics  that  were  left  open  at  the  close  of  the  previous  historical report  are  continued  in  the  current  report  to  provide  future  researchers  a  comprehensive record of events and issues. 5.3.  Writing an Historical Report. 5.3.1.  Ensure  the  narrative  is  original  writing  and  not  copied  from  source  documents  or boilerplate  copied  from  previous  histories.    Copying  text  directly  from  source  documents without using quotation marks represents plagiarism.  Committing wholesale plagiarism may result in the history being returned for re-accomplishment.  A narrative history is not just a summary of dates, places, personnel and statistics, nor is it mere statements of fact in outline form.  Cover  significant  topics  by  not  only  addressing  the  who,  what,  where  and  when  of  a topic, but more importantly, the why and how. 5.3.2.  Write in simple, direct and grammatically correct language. Use past tense and strive as much as possible to write in the active voice. Avoid military jargon, clichés and words not commonly  known.  If  these  are  used,  explain  what  they  mean  in  an  explanatory  footnote. Define or explain scientific and technical terms. Spell out acronyms, abbreviations, and unit designations in the narrative and include them in the Glossary. Do not use office symbols in the narrative because they tend to change over time. 5.3.3.  Provide  complete  dates  in  the  narrative  using  military  style,  that  is,  day,  month,  and year. Example: 30 April 2012. 5.3.4.  Spell  out  the  full  given  name  (first  name,  middle  initial,  and  surname)  when  first mentioning a person in the narrative and in the roster of key personnel. Abbreviate military titles only when followed by initials or given names. Example: Brig Gen John X. Smith. In later references, omit the qualifying part of the military title, spell out the rank, and use only the  last  name.  Example:  General  Smith.  Use  the  full  title  of  civilian  office  holders  without abbreviation in the text. Example: Secretary of Defense John X. Smith. You may abbreviate titles in the notes. Do not substitute military pay grades (O-6) for rank or position titles.   AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 21 5.3.5.  Give precise geographical locations rather than post office numbers, grids, or general areas.  Relate  an  unknown  place  to  a  better-known  one.  Example:  Moody  AFB  is  10  miles northeast  of  Valdosta,  GA.  Include  all  geographical  names  in  the  gazetteer,  if  used. Abbreviate state names only when they follow the name of a town or city. 5.3.6.  . Place lengthy statistics in charts, tables, or appendices; explain their significance and meaning  in  the  narrative.  Include  source  lines  at  the  bottom  to  permit  use  of  the  item  as  a stand-alone  document  and  ensure  all  charts,  tables,  and  appendices  are  properly  marked based on the security and administrative markings that appear on the original document. 5.3.7.  Spell out numbers in the narrative when they are less than 10. Never begin a sentence with  an  Arabic  number.  Always  use  Arabic  numbers  to  express  units  of  time,  weight,  and measurement. Example: 8 hours, 2,000 pounds, 20 feet. 5.3.8.  Use the 24-hour clock when referring to time, making clear whether the time is local (L) or Greenwich Mean Time, which is known in military terminology as Zulu (Z). Example: 2130L or 2130Z. 5.3.9.  Single-space all quotations of five or more typed lines and indent them one half inch from  both  margins.  Use  long quotations only when the meaning would be lost or the value reduced  significantly  by  paraphrasing  or  summarizing.  Use  an  ellipsis,  that  is,  three  spaced dots (…), to indicate the omission of any words from a direct quotation. Use an ellipsis and a period (….), i.e., four spaced dots,  to  indicate an omission at  the end of a sentence. Ensure omissions do not change the meaning of the passage. Give every direct quotation a citation, that is, an acknowledgment of the source. Put a footnote reference number at the end of the quotation. 5.3.10.  Since  components  of  electronic  histories  may  eventually  be  printed  out  by researchers, it is important that the e-document be produced in a readable, consistent format. Use  12-point  Times  New  Roman  or  Arial  font  throughout  the  product,  including  footnote citations.  Use  single-space  and  one-inch  margins.  Do  not  use  multiple  columns.  For  front matter  pages,  use  lowercase  Roman  numerals  centered  at  the  bottom  of  the  page.  For narrative pages and back matter, use Arabic numerals  centered  at  the bottom  of page or on the outside margin at the top of page. 5.4.  Formatting the Periodic History. 5.4.1.  A periodic history consists of a collection of individual electronic  files submitted on CD, DVD or via the internet to the Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA). A root folder (directory) contains all the electronic files that comprise the history. 5.4.2.  The  root  folder  name  is  an  abbreviated  unit  name  with  a  space  between  the  number and unit designation (e.g. 1 FW); followed by a space, the start date of the period the history covers (in YYYYMMDD format), a dash, the end date, a space, and finally the word History. For example, 1 FW 20150101 - 20151231 History would be the root folder name for the 1st Fighter Wing’s calendar year 2015 history.    22 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 5.4.3.  Ensure  the  first  file  in  the  root  folder  is  a  plain  text  format  named  0000  Readme, which  contains  information  about  the  history  to  assist  researchers,  archivists,  and  indexers. AFHRA  personnel  use  the  readme  file,  along  with  the  title  page  and  security  and administrative  markings  page,  to  create  metadata  essential  to  identifying  the  document  and its contents in on-line finding aids. Include the following information in the Readme.doc file: the  number  of  files  that  comprise  the  history;  a  description  of  the  software  and  operating system used to create the document; the type of disc (e.g., DVD-R) and software used to burn the information to disc; and an abstract of key words that identify the most important topics in  the  narrative.  The  historian  may  also  include  any  notes  to  explain  file  numbering  or  the like that would aid the researcher or archivist. 5.4.4.  The next file in the root folder is used to navigate through the entire history. The name of this file is 0001 followed by a space, followed by the name of the root folder (e.g., 0001 1 FW 200401010 - 20041231 History.docx or .pdf). This file contains all front matter and may contain the narrative, and all back matter. 5.4.5.  The 0001 file includes metadata. In Microsoft Word under File, Properties, select the Summary Tab or in Adobe Acrobat Professional, under File, Document Properties, select the Description tab. Historians must fill out the following fields: (T-1). 5.4.5.1.  Title: Identical to the name of the root folder as described in para 5.1.1. 5.4.5.2.  Author: Historian’s name(s) and office. 5.4.5.3.  Subject: Annual History. 5.4.5.4.  Keywords:  Include  suggested  keywords  related  to  the  content  of  the  history. Information  placed  in  the  keywords  section  is  entered  into  AFHRA’s  unclassified database  used  to  research  topics  and  locate  the  information  within  the  Agency’s collection.  The  keywords  added  here  are  extremely  important  pointers  used  to  help researchers locate information. 5.4.6.  Number  files  that  contain  the  remaining  material  sequentially  using  four  digits  (i.e., 0002-9999). Consecutive file numbers are not required. The historian may assign a block of numbers  to  each  component  of  the  history,  but  explain  the  numbering  system  used  in  the readme file. Any additional information in the filename (after the four-digit number) is at the discretion  of  the  historian;  however,  avoid  file  names  with  more  than  50  characters  and spaces because lengthy file names can cause problems burning the material to disc. 5.4.7.  Historians  must  include  supporting  documents  and  photographs  as  individual electronic files. (T-1) 5.4.8.  Preserve photographs collected electronically in their original appearance and save as tagged image file format (.TIF) or .JPG, but .TIF is the preferred format. 5.4.9.  Scan documents collected in hard copy form. This includes the signed title page of the completed history. If the title page is signed using electronic signature, scan and process the title page in the same way as a wet signature page. 5.4.10.  Scanned  documents  require  a  resolution  of  at  least  300  dots  per  inch  (dpi).  This enables  Adobe  Acrobat  Professional  to  render (using optical  character recognition) most of the text making the electronic file keyword searchable. AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 23 5.4.11.  Save  all  scanned  photos  at  a  minimum  of  600  dpi  and  4800  by  6000  pixels  as separate files in .TIF or .JPG format. 5.4.12.  If an email is used as a supporting document, save it as either a PDF or TCT file. If the e-mail has attachments, the historian either saves each attachment as a separate document in its native format or in pdf format. If saved as a PDF file, it can be appended to the original e-mail  or  saved  as  separate,  discrete  document  to  be  cited  on  its  own.  Only  historically significant  attachments  need  to  be  saved  and  preserved  in  the  history.  Do  not  submit Microsoft Outlook .PST files because they cannot be accessioned into the IRIS or accessed when  the  document  is  saved  to  a  CD  or  DVD.  Also,  do  not  save  e-mails  in  OFT  or  MSG formats. 5.4.13.  Save web pages in .PDF or .MHT format and include them as supporting documents. The history may not contain active hyperlinks to a site on the World Wide Web, because web pages  are  not  permanent  and  may  not  be  accessible  through  Inferential  Retrieval  and Indexing System (IRIS). 5.4.14.  Use full footnote citations for each document cited in  the narrative. Do not  use file numbers without citations. This does not preclude the use of ibid. If ibid is used, ensure the previous  footnote  contains  the  footnote  citation.  This  principle  also  applies  to  “See  note above” for multiple source citations. See Attachment 9 for footnote formats. 5.4.15.  Do  not  embed  high-resolution  photographs  or  multimedia  files  in  the  narrative. Embedded photographs increase the file size and significantly increase the time required to download the file. In the narrative, insert a caption that fully describes the importance of the image. Include as much information as possible considering who, what, when and where the photograph  was  taken,  any  classification  markings,  downgrade  and  declassification instructions, administrative or special handling caveats, and the name of the photographer (if known).  Do  not  include  images  that  are  copyrighted.  Include  the  photo  as  a  supporting document  and  cite  the  supporting  document  number.  The  historian  may  include  a  lower-resolution photo in the narrative (quarter-page), with the supporting document number. 5.4.16.  An index is not required. 5.4.17.  Do  not  include  password-protected  files  or  copyrighted  material  in  the  electronic history. Also, do not hide files. 5.4.18.  Submit  the  electronic  history  on  recordable  CDs  or  DVDs.  Archival-quality CD/DVDs are preferred. 5.4.19.  Properly  identify  the  contents  of  the  disc  by  writing  on  the  disc  with  a  fine-point permanent  marker.  See  Attachment  3.  Leave  the  blank  spaces  on  the  disc  for  AFHRA  use. Do not use adhesive labels on the disc. 5.4.20.  See Attachment 3 for more detailed, step-by-step instructions. 24 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 6 ASSESSING HISTORICAL REPORTS AND HISTORY PROGRAMS 6.1.  History  Program  Review.  Air  Force  History  Programs  at  all  levels  are  reviewed periodically to ensure historians are providing relevant and timely products and services to their organizations that deliver long-term value to enhance combat capability of the organization and the Air Force. 6.2.  AF/HO.  AF/HO  monitors  the  status  of  MAJCOM,  DRU,  and  FOA  history  programs  by reviewing  activity  reports,  periodic  histories,  and  other  publications.  AF/HO  also  visits MAJCOM/HOs  and  attends  MAJCOM  historian  workshops  to  gauge  the  management  and operational effectiveness of subordinate history offices. 6.3.  MAJCOM/HO  .  MAJCOM/HOs will conduct periodic visits to monitor the management and operation of subordinate offices.  MAJCOM/HOs, in accordance with MAJCOM guidelines, will also serve as members of the respective Inspector General team and conduct inspections of subordinate history offices. 6.4.  MAJCOM  History  Office  Level.  MAJCOM  History  Offices  or  equivalent  organizations assess  periodic  field  history  reports  with  the  goal  of  building  useful  historical  reports  of  long-term value that enhance combat capability. The review is more than an assessment of compliance with  this  instruction  and  other  relevant  publications.  It  is  a  vehicle  for  providing  mentorship. History reports submitted by subordinate organizations need to be reviewed within 45 calendar days of receipt. The review process encompasses both assessment and feedback. 6.4.1.  Assessment criteria focus on five key areas: Security, Content, Functionality, Format and Organization, and Grammar and Style. Attachment 2, Evaluation Process, lists the steps and questions a reviewer considers in preparing the assessment of a periodic history. 6.4.2.  Security  and  Administrative  Markings.  For  classified  reports,  conduct  an  extensive review  to  ensure  all  portions,  pages,  overall  markings,  and  the  Security  and  Administrative Controls  Page  correctly  identify  classified  material  contained  in  the  product.  Prior  to submitting  the  report  to  the  AFHRA,  the  reviewer  reports  security  errors  to  the  originating historian  for  correction.  For  unclassified  reports,  identify  and  report  any  erroneous administrative markings to the originating historian for correction. 6.4.3.  Content. The periodic history report is reviewed for content in several ways. First and foremost, the historian includes a solid collection of primary source documents. The history provides  a  comprehensive  description  of  unit  activities  related  to  mission  accomplishments and  challenges.  Source  citations  substantiate  the  topics  covered  in  the  text.  The  reviewer needs to be familiar with the organizational mission in order to identify superficial  content, shortfalls in coverage, and/or blatant inaccuracies. 6.4.4.  Functionality.  The  electronic  file  structure  and  format  conform  to  the  directives discussed  in  paragraph  5.4.    This  entails  properly  preparing  the  root  folder  and  including supporting documents in acceptable file formats. 6.4.5.  Format  and  Organization.  The  format  and  arrangement  of  the  components  of  the periodic history report follow the guidelines and intent established in this instruction. AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 25 6.4.6.  Grammar  and  Style.  Review  the  history  report  for  obvious  grammatical  errors, spelling  errors, excessive or unexplained military  jargon or  acronyms,  and other significant stylistic problems. 6.4.7.  The  reviewer  determines  an  overall  rating  based  on  the  five-tier  scale:  Outstanding, Excellent,  Satisfactory,  Marginal,  and  Unsatisfactory.  The  following  descriptions  serve  as benchmarks: 6.4.7.1.  Outstanding.  The  Outstanding  rating  is  reserved  for  a  truly  superior  piece  of historical  research  and  writing.  The  report  clearly  surpasses  an  Excellent  history  in  all respects.  There  are  virtually  no  security  or  administrative  marking  inconsistencies.  The narrative  reflects  the  historian’s  above-average  knowledge  of  the  unit’s  mission  and activities,  and  provides  a  breadth  and  depth  of  coverage  not  usually  found  in  a  unit history.  The  author  discussed  and  analyzed  all  relevant  matters  in  terms  of  the  unit’s mission. The writing style is clear and concise. The historian used active voice and past tense  throughout.    All  supporting  documents  are  relevant.    The  history  conforms  to  all history standards. 6.4.7.2.  Excellent.  An  Excellent  history  exceeds  most  of  the  requirements  for  a Satisfactory  history.  There  are  few,  if  any,  problems  with  security  or  administrative markings.  The  history  covers  most  mission  areas  and  topics  in  a  well-thought  out  and carefully  written  narrative.  The  supporting  document  collection  is  comprehensive  and contains few irrelevant  or insignificant  documents. Errors, omissions, or inconsistencies are few. 6.4.7.3.  Satisfactory.  A  Satisfactory  history  meets  the  basic  requirements  of  the  Air Force  History  and  Museums  Program  as  laid  out  in  this  AFI  and  AFMAN  84-101. Security and administrative markings are generally correct and reflect a basic knowledge of  the  Information  Security  policies  and  procedures.  The  history  covers  key  mission areas. The coverage is objective and includes enough detail to make each subject covered understandable  to  an  informed  reader  or  researcher.  The  history  is  written  from  the commander’s perspective. The historian conducted an interview with the commander and used  the  material  in  the  report.  The  history  focuses  on  the  activities  of  unit  personnel working as a team to accomplish the unit or organization’s mission. The historian wrote the report using simple and direct language. Charts or tables depict statistical information in a logical manner, and the historian describes and analyzes the meaning of the data in the  narrative.  The  supporting  document  collection  gives  evidence  of  a  thorough, continuing  research  effort  and  focuses  on  primary  source  documents  generated  by  the unit. Format problems may exist, but they are few and easily corrected. 6.4.7.4.  Marginal. A Marginal history fails to meet the minimum requirements of the Air Force History and Museums Program and indicates a strong need for corrective action or additional  training  prior  to  the  submission  of  subsequent  histories.  A  Marginal  history leaves out significant topics. It shows evidence of shallow, incomplete research and fails to  include  relevant  supporting  documents.  The  functionality  expected  of  a  Satisfactory electronic  history  is  lacking.    The  historian’s  effort  to  properly  mark  classified  and administratively  controlled  information  displays  significant  problems,  but  does  not warrant an Unsatisfactory rating. 26 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 6.4.7.5.  Unsatisfactory.    Any  history  that  contains  serious  security  and  administrative marking  problems  receives  an  unsatisfactory  rating  and  is  returned  to  the  unit  for correction.    A  history  may  also  earn  an  Unsatisfactory  rating  if  it  is  inadequately researched, poorly organized, badly written, and fails to function as a history. A history that  receives  an  Unsatisfactory  rating  for  these  reasons  is  returned  to  the  unit  to  be reaccomplished. 6.4.7.6.  Not Rated. The MAJCOM/HO may use a “Not Rated” measurement for histories submitted by new historians who are still learning the craft or for histories prepared by, but not submitted by the departing historian.  This enables the MAJCOM/HO to provide feedback  to  a  new  historian  on  works  that  might  be  of  marginal  quality  and  an  actual rating is unwarranted or could be harmful to the development of the incumbent historian. 6.4.8.  The  MAJCOM/HO  or  equivalent  organization  prepares  and  sends  two  memoranda regarding  the  assessment.  Send  a  brief  memorandum  to  the  organization’s  commander highlighting  the  overall  assessment,  key  strengths,  and  recommended  improvement  areas. Send  a  detailed  memorandum  covering  each  key  area  listed  above  to  the  author  outlining specific  findings  and  ratings  in  each  area.    The  detailed  memorandum  serves  as  a constructive  training  tool  and  includes  suggestions  for  improvement.    E-mail  electronic copies of the commander’s memoranda to AF/HO.  WALTER A.

Introduction  : This guide is intended to direct historians in the preparation of electronic histories.  It  is  essential  that  historians  produce  reports  which  meet  the  standards  necessary  to facilitate  accessioning  the  history  into  the  AFHRA  repository.    Currently,  historians  can complete  electronic  histories  using  Microsoft  Word  with  support  from  other  Standard  Desktop Configuration (SDC) software applications like PowerPoint and Excel. The final product may be submitted  in  Microsoft  Word  or  converted  to  Adobe  Acrobat  Professional  portable  document format  (.PDF).  Either  approach  is  acceptable.  This  attachment  focuses  on  the  product.  The Electronic  History  Handbook Information Management/SharePoint site provides step- by-step procedures to accomplish the objectives set forth in this guide. The AFHRA Field Support Division updates the handbook as software menus and functions change. the  AFHMP  Enterprise found on A3.1.1.  Collecting  electronic  documents.  Preparing  useful  periodic  historical  reports  in electronic  form  requires  a  collection  methodology  focused  on  electronic  documents.  The following steps streamline and standardize this process. A3.1.1.1.  Develop  a  collection  plan  based  upon  your  organization’s  mission  and activities.  Organize  the  documents  collected  by  creating  a  collection  folder  for  that reporting  period.  The  historian  may  divide  the  collection  folder  into  subfolders  (or subdirectories)  in  any  way  that  facilitates  construction  of  the  periodic  history.  For example,  some  historians  may  divide  documents  by  chapter  and  further  segregate  each chapter with topical folders. Since research is constant and continuing, historians develop two  sets  of  collection  folders—one  for  the  current  history  and  another  for  the  next history. A3.1.1.2.  During  the  collection  process,  save  electronic  documents  to  the  collection folders. Use a scanner to convert paper documents to an electronic format. A3.1.1.3.  Backup Copies. Periodically (e.g., weekly) backup  your  collection  folder, the folder containing everything you have collected to date. This task could be as simple as copying  the  files  to  a  network  drive  and/or  optical  media  like  a  compact  disc  (CD)  or Digital Versatile Disc Recordable (DVD-/+R). Each backup needs a different name, i.e., 2009  Backup  Hist1,  2009  Backup  Hist2,  etc.  This  procedure  serves  to  protect  against possible  file  corruption  (and  risk  of  loss).  Performing  a  backup  using  the  same  name simply overwrites the previous file. Therefore, a corrupted master file could ruin the most recent backup copy. Keeping a series of backup files provides the historian the option of reverting to an uncorrupted version. A3.1.2.  Research.  During  the  research  process,  save  electronic  documents  in  their  original file  format.  For  instance,  save  a  Microsoft  PowerPoint  briefing  as  a  *.PPT  file.  In  all likelihood, you may not use every document collected in writing the history, so conversion of files to the Adobe Acrobat .PDF format at this point would waste valuable time. A3.1.3.  E-Mail Documents and Attachments. Save all e-mail messages as .PDF or Text Only files. The standard formats employed by Microsoft Outlook are incompatible with conversion 34 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 of digital files to microfilm. Employ historical judgment to determine whether to retain any or all attachments to e-mail messages. A3.1.4.  World Wide Web Pages. Save information gathered from web pages as either .PDF files  or  as  Web  Archive  (single  file  .MHT)  files.  The  historian  saves  the  web  page  as  it appeared  when  cited  in  the  history  and  either  of  these  methods  accomplishes  that  goal.  Do not create hyperlinks to http web-site addresses. A3.1.5.  Dealing  with  Hard  Copy  Documents.    Scan  documents  into  Adobe  ―.PDF Searchable Image‖ (formerly called ―.PDF image on text‖) format. A3.1.6.  Converting  PowerPoint  slides  into  Adobe  Acrobat  Files.  To  convert  PowerPoint slide  presentations  into  .PDF  files,  historians  review  the  slides  to  determine  which  method best  preserves  all  information  contained  in  the  slides.  For  example,  notes  may  exist  within the  slide  presentation  and  by  ―printing‖  as  Notes  Pages,  the  historian  preserves  the  text beneath the slide. Presentations without notes might be equally well preserved by ―printing handouts‖ as two slides per page. A3.1.7.  Handling Microsoft Excel Files. Excel spreadsheets are useful documents, but pose some unique issues when printing or converting to .PDF format. Conversion to .PDF format ―locks  in‖  the  data,  creating  a  tamper-proof  document.  However,  the  conversion  also removes functional  data  such as the  formula used to  populate certain  cells.  Either way, use Excel’s  print  preview  function  to  ascertain  how  the  information  appears  on  a  printed  page. Excel  files  often  print  differently  than  they  appear  on  the  screen  and  this  affects  how  they appear  on  microfilm  and  in  a  .PDF  document.  One  option  might  include  modifying  the column sizes to adjust how much data appears in what would be the ―printed page. A3.2.  Writing  the  periodic  historical  report.  The first  step in  writing  the periodic history is creation  of  a  root  folder.  As  you  write  the  history,  place  the  files  created  into  the  root  folder along  with  the  documents  supporting  your  text.  Do  not  confuse  the  root  folder  with  your collection  folders.  When  you  begin  writing  your  historical  report,  a  daily  backup  of  the  root folder is  advisable to  prevent  losing  your latest  work.  It  is  advisable to  keep multiple versions. Overwriting  previous  backups  could  cause  problems  if  your  “master  file”  became  corrupted, creating two versions of the corrupted file. A3.2.1.  The Root Folder. The root folder name consists of several elements. The title begins with an abbreviated unit name. Insert an underscore between the number and unit designation (e.g.  1st  Fighter Wing would be expressed as 1 FW).  The next element describes the period of  coverage.  Use  the  YYYYMMDD  format  to  indicate  the  beginning  date  of  the  coverage period (e.g., 20070101 for 1 January 2007)  followed by  a dash, the end  date, and the word “History.” For example the 1st Fighter Wing’s History for calendar year 2007 would be: ”1 FW 20070101– 20071231 History”. A3.2.1.1.  Refer  to  AFPD  38-5,  Attachments  2,  3,  and  4  for  unit  and  organizational abbreviations. Other examples: A3.2.1.2.  Air  Combat  Command  2004  Annual  History:  ACC  20040101  –  20041231 History.  AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 35 A3.2.1.3.  Ninth  Air  Force  2004  Semi-Annual  History:  9  AF  20040101  -  20040630 History. NOTE: Ideally, do not create the root folder within your My Documents folder. If something happen to you, your work may not be accessible and could be lost. The root folder should be on the main hard drive or a network drive and might look similar to this: C:”56 FW A3.2.1.4.  20060101  –  20061231  History”.  If  this  is  not  possible  due  to  security restrictions imposed by network operations, proceed with production of the history from your My Document folder. A3.2.2.  Ensure  the  root  folder  has  a  perfectly  “flat”  file  structure.  That  is,  there  are  no folders within the root folder, only files. None of those files are hidden. A3.2.3.  The  first  element  in  the  name  of  any  file  placed  into  the  root  folder  is  four  digits. Prefix numbers below 1000 with zeros (e.g., 13 would be expressed as 0013, 175 as 0175). Adherence  to  this  naming  convention  is  essential  for  proper  conversion  during  the accessioning  process  at  the  AFHRA.  When  naming  files,  please  use  no  more  than  50 characters  and replace spaces with  the underscore. This  prevents  the file  names from  being truncated  by  the  disc  creation  software  and  also  keeps  Microsoft  Word®  from  converting spaces to ”20” which breaks the hyperlink. A3.2.4.  The  Readme  File.  The  first  file  in  the  root  folder  is  a  text  file  named”0000 Readme.txt”  and  contains  information  required  by  the  archivist  and  researcher.  Air  Force Historical  Research  Agency  (AFHRA)  personnel  use  the  readme  file,  along  with  the  title page, the security notice and administrative markings page, and the history report narrative to create  the  metadata  (tagging  information)  essential  to  identifying  the  document  and  its contents. The following information is necessary: A3.2.4.1.  a. The number of files that comprise the history (i.e., number in root folder) A3.2.4.2.  b.  A  description  of  the  software  and  operating  system  used  to  create  the document A3.2.4.3.  c. The type of disc (e.g., DVD-R) and software used to burn the information to disc A3.2.4.4.  d.  An  abstract  of  key  words  that  identify  the  most  important  topics  in  the narrative.  The  historian  may  also  include  any  data  that  would  aid  future  researchers  or archivists, especially information that might help explain the file numbering system. See Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 below. A3.2.5.  Front  Matter.  The  second  file  contains  all  front  matter  (title  page  through chronology).  It  should  have  the  same  name  as  the  root  folder,  preceded  by  0001  [hereafter cited as the 0001 file].  For example, the 56th Fighter Wing 2006 annual history will have a file  named:  0001  56  FW  20060101  -  20061231  History.doc  or  0001  56  FW  20060101  – 20061231 History.pdf. A3.2.6.  Numbering Files in the History. Each file following 0001 is numbered sequentially. A3.2.6.1.  The file numbering places the contents of the root folder in linear sequence so that the files are microfilmed in the correct order. 36 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 A3.2.6.2.  Some historians assign a file number to each component of the history report. When employing this multiple file  technique, number the files sequentially to achieve a linear  progression  in  the  same  manner  as  printed  material  (i.e.  Chapter  1  should  be assigned a number lower than the one used for Chapter 2). Hyperlinking is optional, but if used entries in the Table of Contents should be hyperlinked to the corresponding files in the root folder. A3.2.6.3.  Other  historians  have  chosen  to  place  all  front  matter,  the  narrative,  and  all back matter into a single file. This approach works best with Adobe or Word files.  The single  file  approach  provides  a  clear  advantage  in  the  ability  to  conduct  effective  key word searches. The following table depicts a partial representation of the files that might appear in the root folders of histories with multiple files or consisting of a single file: Table A3.1.  Example Root Folder. Multiple File History--Root Folder 0000 Readme.txt 0001 20 FW 20040101 – 20041231 History.docx (or History.PDF) 0002 Chapter 1-Mission andOrganization.docx 0003 Chapter 2-Operations and Training.docx 0004 Chapter 3-Logistics and Support.docx 0005 Appendix A-Lineage and Honors.docx 0006 Appendix B-Key Personnel.docx 0007 Appendix C-Personnel Statistics.docx 0008 Appendix D-Organizational Chart.docx Consolidated History--Root Folder 0000 Readme.txt 0001 20 FW 20040101 – 20041231 History.docx (or History.PDF)         A3.2.7.  The Document Numbering System.  While documents require sequential numbering, there  is  no  requirement  for  consecutive  file  numbers  in  the  history.  Using  a  consecutive system would require each file to be numbered successively through the last file saved in the history. The sequential numbering system allows the use of numbering blocks. For example, file numbers 0000 – 0099 can be used for the readme file, front matter, chapters, appendices, and  back  matter  such  as  the  list  of  supporting  documents.  The  first  number  assigned  to  a supporting document falls after the number assigned to  the distribution list  (not necessarily the immediately following number). For instance, the historian could reserve 0200-0300 for G-series  orders;  0400-0600  for  documents  cited  only  in  the  chronology;  and  so  on.  Also, offices  with  multiple  historians  might  want  to  reserve  a  number  block  for  each  historian writing  a  separate  chapter  to  streamline  integration  of  the  product  at  publication  time.  The following  sample  illustrates  how  the  documents  would  appear  in  the  file  folder  if  the Distribution  List  was  file  number  0099  and  the  historian  assigned  G-series  orders  a  0200 block designation and Chapter 1 supporting documents the block beginning with 1000. The files would be listed in the root folder as follows: A3.2.7.1.  0099 Distribution List.doc. A3.2.7.2.  0200 GA-01.doc. A3.2.7.3.  0201 GA-02.doc. A3.2.7.4.  1000 Designed Operational Capability Statement.doc. AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 37 A3.2.7.5.  1001 20 FW Mission Brief.ppt. A3.2.8.  Hyperlinks to Supporting Documents. The periodic history is a reference tool and a guide  to  the  supporting  document  collection.  Hyperlinking  connects  the  user  to  the  sources cited  in  writing  the  history.  Therefore  it  is  very  important  to  ensure  that  if  hyperlinks  are used, each hyperlink takes the user to the correct document. A3.2.8.1.  Move or copy the supporting document  file to  the  root folder  before  creating the hyperlink. Moving a file after a hyperlink is accomplished breaks the link. A3.2.8.2.  If you plan on converting supporting document files to .PDF, convert the files prior to hyperlinking the citation to the document. A3.2.8.3.  As described in Attachment 9, when a source cited in a footnote is included as a  supporting  document,  the  supporting  document  number  immediately  follows  the citation. While the four-digit number is sufficient, some historians prefix the number with ―SD1. That practice allows the historian to rapidly search text for supporting document citations.  Variations  of  the  renaming  and  relocation  of  a  supporting  document  file  are illustrated below: Table A3.2.  Variations in Supporting Document File. Original Folder and File Name C:\collection folder\Luke AFB Land Encroachment.doc New Folder and File Name C:\56 FW 20040101 - 20041231 History\3009 Luke Encroachment.PDF Comments Added 3009 to precede file name as it originally appeared C:\collection folder\Luke AFB Land Encroachment.doc C:\56 FW 20040101 – 20041231 History\3009 Encroach.pdf C:\collection folder\Luke AFB Land Encroachment.doc C:\56 FW 20040101 – 20041231 History\3009.pdf Added 3009 and truncated original file name to ―Encroach Changed file name to use only the supporting document number: 3009 NOTE: The historian may choose to place any additional information in the file names as long as each file begins with four digits (including leading zeroes) followed by a space. Adding the date of the document (1234 20160405 File Name facilitates searching by date. Shortening the file name is permissible and may be required for excessively long file names, which can create problems in burning the history to disc.  38 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 A3.2.9.  Handling Attachments. Attachments may be combined into a single document using Adobe Acrobat Professional or kept as separate, but subordinate supporting documents when keeping the documents in  their native  format.  In the latter  case, simply add an alphabetical character to the file number as depicted in the examples below, the File Type Description is presented here for clarification purposes only: Table A3.3.  File Type Description. File Name 1050 Questions on Luke AFB Land Acquisition.RTF 1050a Luke Land Encroachment Case Study.doc 1050b Luke Land Acquisition Update.ppt File Type Description E-mail message Attachment 1 to e-mail Attachment 2 to e-mail A3.2.10.  Creating  the  List  of  Supporting  Documents.  List  all  supporting  documents  in numerical order, by chapter, giving the same identifying information and classification data required  in  the  footnote.  List  all  documents  in  sequential  order  as  they  appear  in  the  root folder. A3.2.11.  Creating  the  Table  of  Contents.  The  table  may  be  constructed  as  the  history  is written  but  can  be  completed  only  after  the  pagination  is  firm  (usually,  this  means  after coordination  is  complete).  In  addition  to  supplying  the  page  numbers  for  each  topic,  if hyperlinks  are  used,  hyperlink  the  topics  and/or  associated  page  numbers  to  the corresponding portions of the narrative as indicated in the example below. Table A3.4.  Example of Table of Content.  Chapter I- Mission and Organization.......................................................... 1 Mission.................................................................................................. 3 Organization.......................................................................................... 8 or Chapter I- Mission and Organization.......................................................... 1 Mission.................................................................................................. 3 Organization.......................................................................................... 8  A3.2.12.  The  Signed  Title  Page.  There  are  two  procedures  for  preserving  the  signed  title page-one for Microsoft Word and one for Adobe Acrobat Professional. Choose the one that matches your publication method. A3.2.12.1.  To  create  the  Title  Page  for  a  Microsoft  Word  history,  place  the  word ”SIGNATURE”  above  the  printed  name  of  the  signing  official.  Use  the  word SIGNATURE to create a hyperlink to a scanned image of an actual signed page. Treat the scanned  image  as  a  supporting  document  and  assign  it  a  number  higher  than  the  last supporting document in the root folder. A3.2.12.2.  To  create  the  Title  Page  for  an  Adobe  Acrobat  history,  scan  the  signed  title page  and  insert  it  as  the  first  page  in  the  0001  file.  You  may  find  it  useful  to  create  a placeholder title page and replace it with the signed title page. AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 39 A3.3.  Publishing  the  Periodic  History  to  Optical  Media  .  Use  an  approved  recording application  to  create  a  Compact  Disc-Recordable  (CD-R)  or  Digital  Versatile  Disc  (DVD- formerly  Digital  Video  Disc).    Typically,  a  CD-R  holds  about  700  megabytes  of  data  while  a DVD-/+R holds about 4.7 gigabytes. For very large histories, use DVDs to transmit histories to AFHRA. This facilitates accountability and control of histories stored at AFHRA. In some cases, a history may exceed the capacity of one DVD, but the hyperlinks are restored when the history is  reassembled on AFHRA’s servers.  NOTE: There  are several  types of blank media.  Industry standards suggest DVD+R media are the best for archiving data; however, older hardware may not support the +R standard. Check available hardware before purchasing blank CDs or DVDs to publish the history. A3.4.  Submission of the Periodic History Report.  Use a permanent marker to place the name of the history and proper security instructions on the non-readable side of the disc as shown in Figure  A3.2.  Leave  space  for  AFHRA  technicians  to  provide  additional  identification  data. Place  the  disc  in  a  jewel  case  and  label  the  case  as  shown  in  Figure  A3.1.  Do  not  place  more than one disc in a case or package any disc in a manner that could degrade the readability of the disc.  Comply  with  all  security  instructions  when  packaging,  tracking,  and  transmitting  the disc(s). Follow MAJCOM/HO guidelines in distributing the history. Ensure retention of at least one fully functioning copy for the unit historical repository. Figure A3.1.  Jewel Case Insert Sample Markings.  40 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 Figure A3.2.

Introduction.  Footnotes  provide  the  primary  means  of  identifying  sources  of information.  In  addition,  authors  may  use  explanatory  notes  for  reasons  of  style  or organization.  For  example,  use  an  explanatory  note  to  define  technical  terms  or  include  a long list of names that would clutter up the text. A9.2.  Use  of  Footnotes.  Use  footnotes  without  exception.  Footnotes  are  much  easier  for researchers to use than endnotes, especially on microfilm or in scanned or electronic images. A9.3.  Numbering Footnotes.  Use the word processor’s footnote function to number footnotes consecutively  through  each  chapter.  If  you  do  not  use  chapter  divisions,  number  footnotes consecutively through the entire text. The word processing system automatically superscripts the footnote number. A9.3.1.  Insert a footnote in the text immediately following the appropriate clause or phrase, without spacing. A9.3.2.  Cite the source of each direct quotation. Place a footnote at the end of an indented quotation. A9.3.3.  Single-space the text of each footnote. Indent the first line of each note one-half inch and double-space between footnotes. A9.3.4.  Footnote citations indicate if the source has been included as a supporting document by the addition of a four-digit number at the end of the citation. A9.3.5.  Use  the  same  font  size in  the  footnote  as  in  the  narrative.  For  example,  use  Times New Roman, 12-point in both. A9.4.  Footnote Portion Markings.  In a classified product, footnotes require a portion marking, just  like  a  paragraph.  Mark  each  footnote  with  the  highest  classification  the  footnote  contains, immediately following the note number. A9.4.1.  Single  source  example:  (U)  Memo  (S//DECL  20151013),  HQ  ACC/CC,  to  395 FW/CC, “(U) Operation Gold Box,” 20 Mar 2009, SD 1066 (info used is C). A9.4.2.  Multiple  source  example:  (U)  Memo  (S//DECL  20151013),  HQ  ACC/CC,  to  395 FW/CC,  “(U)  Operation  Gold  Box,”  20  Mar  2009,  SD  1066  (info  used  is  C);  Memo (S//DECL  20151012),  HQ  ACC/CC,  to  395  FW/CC,  “(U)  Operation  Silver  Bell,”  25  Mar 2010, SD 1067 (info used is U). A9.4.3.  Citing a classified title makes the footnote a classified paragraph. For example, (S) Memo (S//DECL 20190330), HQ ACC/CC to 395 FW/CC, “(S) Operation GOLD BOX,”  30  Mar  2009,    SD  1066    (Info    used    is  C).  To  avoid  this,  do  not  use  classified  subjects.  The same rules apply to explanatory footnotes. A9.5.  Citations.  Keep  note  citations  brief,  using  the  standard  formats  in  this  attachment.  Use abbreviations, acronyms, and office symbols to shorten citations; however, do not be so brief that researchers have trouble identifying your sources of information. AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 49 A9.6.  Citation  Sequence.  Footnotes  contain  all  the  data  needed  to  fully  identify  the  source. Document citations follow this sequence: type of document; classification, warning notices and special  notations  (caveats);  declassification  instructions;  originator;  recipient(s);  subject;  date; paragraph  or  page  number  (in  lengthy  documents);  and  supporting  document  number,  if applicable. A9.6.1.  Indicate type of document (memorandum, message, report, etc.). A9.6.2.  Source citations contain the document’s  classification, declassification instructions, warning  notices,  and  special  administrative  handling  caveats.  Place  these  markings  in parentheses  immediately  after  the  type  of  document,  followed  by  a  comma.  Cite declassification  dates  in  the  following  8-digit  format:  YYYYMMDD.  Example:    Memo (S/Rel USA, CAN/FOUO/DECL 20330308). A9.6.2.1.  Indicate any differences between the overall classification or special notations of the source(s) and the information used in the narrative. If the cited information comes from a portion that is marked differently from the overall classification of the source, add (Info  used  is  [specific  classification]))  immediately  after  the  citation.  Example:  Memo (S/NF/FOUO/DECL 20180308), Col John X. Doe, 10BW/CC to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on Exercise Bingo,” 8 Mar 08, SD 2401 (Info used is Confidential) or (Info used is C). A9.6.2.2.  Documents with obsolete, invalid, or missing declassification instructions. A9.6.2.3.  For  non-current  markings,  such  as  OADR,  X1  through  X8,  MR,  etc.,  see current  guidance in  DoDM 5200.01-V2 for calculated declassification  instructions.  For documents  with  no  declassification  instructions  and/or  no  date,  see  DoDM  5200.01-V2 for calculated declassification instructions.   The marking OADR (Originating Agency’s Determination  Required)  was  abolished  13  October  1995.  For  documents  so  marked, insert “Source marked OADR; date of source YYYYMMDD.” Example: Rpt (S/Source marked OADR; date of source 20040308), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on Exercise Bingo,” 8 Mar 04. Documents marked OADR and dated after  13  October  1995  are  to  be  Declassified  25  years  from  the  date  of  the  source document. A9.6.2.4.  Declassification  markings  X1  through  X8  were  introduced  in  October  1995 and abolished 22 September 2003. Documents with these exemption categories are to be Declassified 25 years from the date of the document. A9.6.2.5.  A  message  that  originated  with  an  X3  exemption  in  1999  would  appear  as follows: Msg (S/Source Marked X3/DECL 20240314), ACC/CC to 5 BW/CC et al., “(U) Special Operations Mission,” 141830Z Mar 99. A9.6.2.6.  An incorrectly marked report published after the rule change would appear as follows:  Rpt  (S/Source Marked X3/DECL 20290922), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on Exercise Bingo,” 8 Mar 04. A9.6.2.7.  The  marking  MR  (Manual  Review)  has  never  been  authorized  for  use  as  a Declassification  instruction.    If  “MR”  appears  in  the  “Declassify  on”  line  of  a  source document,  mark  the  derivative  document  with  a  declassification  date  no  more  than  25 years  from  the  date  of  the  source  document.    Example:    Rpt  (S/Source  marked  MR; 50 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 DECL  20290308).  Col  John  X.  Doe,  10  BW/CC,  to  10  BW/CV  et  al.,  “(U)  Report  on Exercise Bingo,” 8 Mar 04. A9.6.2.8.  For documents with no Declassification instruction, so indicate and include the date  of  the  document.  Example:    Rpt  (S/No  DECL  Instr;  source  dated  20040308),  Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to  10 BW/CV et  al., “(U) Report on Exercise Bingo,” 8 Mar 04. A9.6.2.9.  For  documents  with  no  Declassification  instructions,  calculated  a  date  of  25 years from the date of the source document (if available) or the current date (if the source document date is not available) shall be used as a derivative classification date. Example: Rpt (S/No DECL Instr; YYYYMMDD), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on Exercise Bingo,” n.d. A9.6.2.10.  Department  of  Defense  and  Air  Force  security  and  administrative  markings policies  and  procedures  are  described  in  detail  in  Department  of  Defense  Manual (DoDM)  5200.01,  "DoD  Information  Security  Program:  Marking  of  Classified Information,"  Chg  2,  19  March  2013.  The  National  Archives  and  Records Administration's  (NARA)  Information  Security  Oversight  Office  (ISSO)  has  prepared  a guide  (http://www.archives.gov/isoo/training/marking  booklet.pdf)  that  summarizes that basic marking procedures mandated by Executive Order (EO) 13526, 29 Dec 2009, but  DoDM  5200.01,  especially  Enclosures  3  and  4,  goes  into  much  greater  detail  and offers marking examples that will be of use to Air Force historians. A9.6.3.  Always  include  the  originating  office.  Include  receiving  office(s)  as  appropriate. End with a comma. Example: Memo (S/Rel USA, CAN/DECL 20330320), 10 BW/CC to 10 BW/CV, A9.6.3.1.  Include  names  as  appropriate,  especially  on  personal  correspondence. Example: Memo (S/Rel USA, CAN/DECL 20330320), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CV, A9.6.3.2.  When  the  correspondence  goes  to  more  than  one  recipient,  cite  the  first  one and then use et al. (et alia, meaning “and others”). The use of italics is not required. Note: In some cases, such as staff summary sheets, list the final, most important recipient only. Examples: Memo (S/DECL 20330320), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al, . . . ; SSS (U), AF/A8X to AF/CC. A9.6.4.  Always include the subject when citing correspondence. Place subjects in quotation marks and end with  a comma. Example:  Memo  (S/DECL 20330320), Col  John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., “(U) Report on Exercise Bingo.” A9.6.4.1.  Provide a short, descriptive subject, in brackets, if the subject does not appear in the document. A9.6.4.2.  Replace  classified  subjects  or  titles  with  a  placeholder  in  brackets.  This  is preferable to  inserting a  short descriptive title that  might  include classified information. Example:  Memo  (S/20330320),  Col  John  X.  Doe,  10  BW/CC,  to  10  BW/CV  et  al., [Classified Subject], AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 51 A9.6.4.3.  Designate  exact  titles  of  published  works  (books,  pamphlets,  magazines,  and newspapers)  in  italics.  Use  quotation  marks  around  titles  of  chapters,  articles,  notes, documents, reports, and the like. A9.6.5.  Include  the  date  or,  for  messages,  the  six-digit  date-time  group.  Example:    Msg (S/DECL 20330320), 10 BW/CC to ACC/CV et al., “(U) Exercise Bingo,” 201631Z Mar 08. A9.6.5.1.  If  the  document  is  not  dated  and  you  know  an  approximate  date,  use ―circa (abbreviated  ca.)  plus  the  approximate  date.  Example,  Memo  (S/DECL  20330320),  Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to  10 BW/CV et  al.,  “(U) Report on Exercise Bingo,”  ca. 20 Mar 08, SD 1234. A9.6.5.2.  If  you  don’t  know  an  approximate  date,  use  n.d.  (no  date)  as  a  last  resort. Example: Memo (S/DECL 20330320), Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CC, to 10 BW/CV et al., [Classified Subject], n.d. A9.6.6.  Provide  a  complete  citation  the  first  time  any  source  is  mentioned  in  a  chapter. Thereafter,  shortened  titles  may  be  used  for  frequently  cited  works.  Identify  short  titles  by placing  them  in  brackets  immediately  following  the  full  citation.  Use  shortened  titles sparingly.  Example:  Rpt  (S/DECL  20330320),  Col  John  X.  Doe,  509  BW/CC,  “(U)  Report on Exercise Bingo,” 5 Jan – 28 Feb 2008, 20 Mar 08 [hereafter cited as Doe Rpt], p 4, SD 2209. A9.7.  Multiple  Sources.  When  citing  more  than  one  source,  separate  individual  source citations  by  semicolons.  Such  footnotes  are  called  multiple-source  footnotes.  Example:  Memo (S/DECL  20330320),  Col  John  X.  Doe,  10  BW/CC,  to  10  BW/CV  et  al.,  “(U)  Report  on Exercise Bingo,” 5 Jan – 28 Feb 2008, 20 Mar 08, SD 2209 (Info used is C); Intvw (U), John X. Doe, 10 BW/HO, with Col John X. Doe, 10 BW/CV, 6 Feb 09, SD 2210. A9.8.  Explanatory  Footnotes.  In explanatory footnotes (as distinguished from source-citation or  reference  notes),  write  in  the  same  style  as  the  narrative  (past  tense,  active  voice).  Place  all direct  quotations  in  footnotes  within  quotation  marks,  regardless  of  length;  do  not  indent extended quotations within the footnote. A9.9.  Use  of  Ibid.  When  referring  to  an  immediately  preceding  note  that  contains  only  one source,  use  the  abbreviation  ibid.  (meaning  “in  the  same  place’).  As  ibid.  is  a  commonly  used word,  the  use  of  italics  is  not  required.  When  referring  to  all  the  sources  in  the  preceding multiple-source  note,  use  “See  note  above.”  Beware  of  editing  text  that  could  reorder  the footnotes. A9.10.  Citation  Examples.  The  following  citations  demonstrate  some  of  the  many  of  the combinations  used  in  periodic  history  footnotes.    Historians  must  cite  documents  and  apply security portion markings as shown in  the most  current  version of DoD  5200.01, Vol 2,  “DoD Information Security Program, Marking of Classified Information.” (T-0)  Historians with access to intelligence and special access programs receive appropriate additional training from program managers.

Readme File.  0000 README FILE  History of the 416th Bomb Wing, 1 January – 31 December 2003  This history was published in an electronic format containing 579 files. All files that comprised the electronic history were contained in a single directory, named ―416 BW 20030101- 20031231 History.‖  It is intended that the history reside on web-based servers at the Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA), Maxwell AFB, Alabama. All of the files fit neatly onto one DVD-R. This disc transferred the report to the server, where all files are to reside in a single directory.  A copy of these files is stored on archival microfilm and from that point forward, the microfilm is the record, or official copy.  The following hyperlink provides access to the entire history report: “0001 416 BW 20030101-20031231 History.pdf.”  The Table of Contents is located within this file and allows for easy navigation of the history report. The footnotes within the narrative are hyperlinked to the supporting document files.  The narrative was written in Microsoft (MS) Word and was converted to PDF using Adobe Acrobat Professional Version x. The end product gives the appearance of a printed paper copy and enhances the long term archiving of the periodic history report.    The supporting document files are in their native format, meaning the files are in their original format with some exceptions. For example MS Word (.DOC), MS Powerpoint (.PPT), MS Excel (.XLS), Rich Text Format (.RTF), plain text (.TXT), and images (.JPG or .TIF). The exceptions are MS Outlook Message that may have originated as (.MSG) or (.OFT) formats but have been saved as (.TXT) or (.PDF) file formats. Additionally, world-wide-web files originally presented as (.html) have been saved in an archive format as (.MHT) or (.PDF) files. These exceptions enhance long term storage of the information.  Microfilming requirements drove the naming of files. The software used to create a microfilm copy of the electronic documents read and films the documents in alphanumeric order. The files were therefore named so that the microfilm copy mirrors the printed copy.    60 AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 ABSTRACT Place a keywords or narrative abstract here.

SAMPLE  0000 README FILE  History of Air Combat Command, January - December 2005  This history was published and submitted to the Air Force Historical Agency in an electronic format. The history includes 1,261 files in one single directory (folder) named ACC 20050101- 20051231 History. The files were named so that opening or printing them in sequence would mirror the traditional paper copy RCS: HAF-HO (A) 7101.  The narrative, files 0001 through 0099, was written in Microsoft (MS) Word and formatted to appear as written pages of 8.5 x 11 inches. Other formats for files include MS PowerPoint and Excel, Rich Text Format (.RTF), plain text (.TXT), images (.JPG, .TIF), Adobe Acrobat (.PDF), and world-wide-web files saved as ―Web Archive, single file‖ (.MHT). All files open using the Air Force approved software for NIRPNET and SIPRNET accounts as of July 2006.  The documents used in writing the history are included as files numbered 0100 through 5068 and alphabetized as AFRC through Signature. The alphabetized files are all special orders with the exception of Signature which is the title page with the commander’s signature. Files 0100 through 0343 are documents used for the chronology and appendices; usually they are not cited in the text (chapters 1-4). Files numbered 1001 through 5068 are the documents used in writing the text. A block of 1000 files was assigned to each of the five individuals who wrote sections of the text.  AFI84-101  16 FEBRUARY 2017 61 ABSTRACT  The history emphasizes the operational activities of the command including support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, Operation ENDURING FREEDOM, and Operation NOBLE EAGLE.
