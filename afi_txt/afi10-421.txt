Purpose.  This  AFI  implements  AFPD  10-4,  Operations  Planning:    Air  &  Space Expeditionary Force, and provides guidance on strategy development, planning, execution, and assessment in support of steady-state military operations involving general purpose forces. 1.2.  Steady-State Framework.  The Department of Defense (DOD) has used a variety of terms over  the  years  to  describe  military  operations  that  don’t  involve  war,  crisis,  and  contingency.  This AFI adopts the term “steady-state” to describe this type of military operations because the term  is  used  extensively in  DOD strategic  guidance and joint  doctrine.   The DOD lexicon will likely evolve over time, and this AFI will evolve with it. 1.3.  Steady-State  Defined.  The  steady-state  is  a  stable  condition  involving  continuous  and recurring operations and activities with simultaneous absence of major military, crisis response, and  contingency  operations.    The  steady-state  is  characterized  by  shaping  operations  and activities  at  a  relatively  low  level  of  intensity,  urgency,  and  commitment  of  military  forces.  Shaping  is  designed  to  influence  the  environment  in  order  to  prevent  and  deter  future  conflict, mitigate operational risks, and strengthen United States (US) and partner capabilities to respond to  major  operations,  campaigns,  crisis  response,  and  limited  contingencies.    Steady-state operations are conducted within the range of military operations (ROMO) in  Figure 1.1, which includes  five  categories  of  shaping  operations:    military  engagement  and  security  cooperation, posture, phase 0, ongoing operations, and deterrence.  It is important to note the ROMO model is a  continuous  range  of  operations,  rather  than  a  set  of  three  discrete  and  increasing  escalatory “steps.”    Said  another  way,  specific  military  operations  fall  somewhere  along  this  continuous range and may have attributes of more than one “step.” Figure 1.1.  The Range of Military Operations 1.3.1.  Military Engagement and Security Cooperation.  Military engagement and security cooperation strengthen  relationships  with  international  and domestic partners, secure access for  peacetime  and  contingency  operations,  build  the  capacity  and  capability  of  partner nations, and promote interoperability with partner nations.  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   5  1.3.2.  Posture.    Global  defense  posture  describes  the  US  forces  and  capabilities  forward stationed  and  rotationally  deployed  for  defense  activities  in  foreign  countries  and  US territories  overseas,  as  well  as  the  network  of  bases,  infrastructure,  and  international agreements  and  arrangements  that  underwrite  and  support  the  stationing,  deployment,  and employment of these forces.  The DOD recognizes posture as three interdependent elements:  forces, footprint, and agreements. 1.3.2.1.  Forces:  US military capabilities, equipment, and units. 1.3.2.2.  Footprint: infrastructure, facilities, and pre-positioned equipment.   The  overseas  network  of  bases, lines  of  communication, 1.3.2.3.  Agreements:    The  series  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  international  agreements and other host nation arrangements with foreign governments addressing access, transit, and  status  protection  that  sets  the  terms  regarding  US  military  presence  and  operations overseas. 1.3.3.  Phase 0.  Phase 0 operations are shaping actions specifically linked to a contingency plan, either an operation plan (OPLAN) or concept plan (CONPLAN).  Figure 1.2 illustrates a  joint  phasing  model  with  phase  0  (shape)  depicted  in  two  locations:    preceding  phase  I (deter) and also following phase V (enable civil authority).  Note:  As discussed throughout Paragraph  1.3,  the  term  “shape”  is  also  used  in  reference  to  a  broader  set  of  steady-state actions,  well  beyond  the  phase  0  (shape)  operations  strictly  associated  with  OPLANs  and CONPLANs. 1.3.4.  Ongoing  Operations.    Ongoing  operations  are  steady-state  military  operations conducted  in  support  of  combatant  commander  (CCDR)  objectives,  but  not  specifically linked  to  an  OPLAN  or  CONPLAN.    Named  operations  often  fall  within  this  category.  There are many examples of ongoing operations involving Air Force forces, including theater security  packages;  continuous  bomber  presence;  air  policing;  counterdrug;  intelligence, surveillance,  and  reconnaissance  (ISR);  air  mobility;  homeland  defense;  space;  cyberspace; and integrated air and missile defense operations. 1.3.5.  Deterrence.    Deterrence  is  the  prevention  of  action  by  the  existence  of  a  credible threat  of  unacceptable  counteraction  and/or  belief  that  the  cost  of  action  outweighs  the perceived  benefits  (JP  3-0,  Joint  Operations).    “Deterring  activities”  can  occur  at  any  time and  in  any  phase,  including  periods  of  crisis  or  contingency  (see  Figure  1.2).    In  addition, deterrence  can  also  be  associated  with  the  shaping  categories  of  military  engagement  and security  cooperation,  posture,  phase  0,  and  ongoing  operations.    Phase  I  (deter)  activities represent the transition from steady-state to contingency operations.   6  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 Figure 1.2.  Joint Phasing Model (Joint Publication (JP) 5-0, Joint Operation Planning) 1.4.  Combatant  Commander  Strategy.  Operations  planning  for  the  steady-state  is  informed by  CCDR  strategy.    Theater  and  functional  strategies  outline  a  CCDR’s  vision  for  integrating and synchronizing military activities and operations with the other instruments of national power in order to achieve national strategic objectives.  CCDR strategies:  1.4.1.  Link  national  strategic  guidance  and  joint  operations  planning  in  order  to  achieve national and regional objectives and end states. 1.4.2.  Link  combatant  command  (CCMD)  operations  and  resources  to  US  government policy and strategic guidance. 1.4.3.  May  include  the  commander’s  vision,  mission,  challenges,  trends,  assumptions, priorities, objectives, and resources. 1.4.4.  Normally  emphasize  security  cooperation  activities,  building  the  capacity  and capability of partner nations, partner relationships, interoperability, posture, and preparation for contingencies. 1.4.5.  Should  consider  the  means  or  resources  available  to  support  the  accomplishment  of designated objectives and end states, and may include military resources, programs, policies, and available funding. 1.4.6.  Provide  guidance  to  subordinates  and  supporting  commands/agencies  and  improve coordination with other federal agencies and regional partners. 1.4.7.  Are executed through CCDR campaign plans. AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   7  1.5.  Combatant  Commander  Campaign  Plan.  The  DOD’s  principal  steady-state  plan  is  the CCDR  campaign  plan.    A  campaign  is  a  series  of  related  major  operations  aimed  at  achieving strategic and operational objectives within a given time and space (JP 5-0).  Although intended primarily to guide the use of military power, campaigns plans should consider all instruments of national  power  and  how  their  integrated  and/or  coordinated  efforts  work  to  attain  national strategic objectives.  The campaign plan operationalizes a CCDR’s strategy by comprehensively and  coherently  integrating  steady-state  and  contingency  operations.    A  CCDR’s  strategy  and resultant  campaign  plan  are  designed  to  achieve  the  prioritized  theater  and  global  (campaign) objectives from  the Guidance  for Employment of the  Force (GEF) and serve  as the integrating framework  that  informs  and  synchronizes  all  subordinate  and  supporting  planning  and operations. 1.5.1.  Campaign  plans  integrate  CCMD  steady-state  activities,  which  include  military engagement and security cooperation, posture, phase 0, ongoing operations, and deterrence. 1.5.2.  Campaign  plans  focus  on  CCMD  steady-state  activities  over  the  next  two  to  five years,  including  current  and  ongoing  operations.    GEF-defined  campaign  objectives  are designed to be militarily achievable within a five-year planning horizon. 1.5.3.  Campaign  plans  shift  the  long-standing  focus  from  responsive  action  to  early,  more comprehensive,  and  proactive  measures  that  serve  to  defuse  strategic  problems  before  they become  crises,  and  resolve  crises  before  they  reach  the  stage  requiring  large-scale contingency operations.  At the same time, campaign plans will set the conditions for success should contingency operations become necessary. 1.5.4.  Contingency plans for responding to crisis scenarios will be treated as branch plans to GEF-directed campaign plans. 1.5.5.  Steady-state activities and requirements serve as phase 0 for contingency operations. 1.5.6.  In linking steady-state objectives with resources and activities, campaign plans enable resource-informed planning and permit prioritization across DOD. 1.5.7.  Campaign plans identify specific, measureable intermediate military objectives (IMO) necessary  for  prioritization  and  assessment,  maximizing  the  effect  of  limited  resources.  Campaign  plans  link  steady-state  objectives,  activities,  and  resource  demands,  facilitating assessment across the CCMD area of responsibility (AOR). 1.5.8.  Campaign plans identify priority countries and their desired role in helping to achieve US  steady-state  objectives  or  contingency  end  states.    Security  cooperation  activities encourage and enable partners to perform these roles. 1.5.9.  Commanders responsible for executing campaign plans: 1.5.9.1.  Establish  IMOs  that  directly  and  measurably  contribute  to  the  achievement  of each campaign objective provided in the  GEF.   IMOs must be  accompanied by metrics that permit assessment of progress toward those objectives. 1.5.9.2.  Assess a baseline status for each IMO against which progress can be measured. 1.5.9.3.  Maintain  situational  awareness  of  campaign  plan  execution  to  evaluate  the success  of the  strategic environment. implementation,  campaign  feasibility,  and  changes to   8  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 1.6.  Campaign  Plan  Types.  Campaign  plans  are  joint  operations  plans  for  a  series  of  related major operations aimed at achieving strategic or operational objectives within a given time and space.    Refer  to  the  Joint  Strategic  Capabilities  Plan  (JSCP)  for  a  current  summary  of  tasked campaign plans. 1.6.1.  Global Campaign Plan (GCP).  A GCP is developed when the scope of contemplated military  operations  exceeds  the  authority  or  capabilities  of  a  single  CCDR  to  plan  and execute (e.g., pandemic  influenza and infectious  disease).  GCPs establish the strategic and operational  framework  within  which  subordinate  campaign  plans  (SCP)  are  developed  (see Paragraph  1.6.3  below).    The  GCP’s  framework  also  facilitates  synchronizing  the  many interdependent,  cross-AOR  activities  such  as  security  cooperation,  ISR  collection,  and coalition support. Figure 1.3.  Plans Relationship (JP 5-0) 1.6.2.  Theater Campaign Plan (TCP).  The TCP is the geographic combatant commander’s (GCC) plan to accomplish strategic or operational objectives within a geographic AOR.  The TCP operationalizes the GCC’s theater strategy and translates strategic concepts into unified actions.    GCCs  develop  TCPs  that  integrate  military  engagement  and  security  cooperation, posture, phase 0, ongoing operations, and deterrence. 1.6.3.  Subordinate  Campaign  Plan.    The  SCP  is  a  GCC-developed  plan  that  satisfies  the requirements under a GCP, which, depending on the circumstances, transitions to a supported or  supporting  plan  in  execution.    SCPs  should  simultaneously  nest  under  the  TCP  and  be synchronized  with  the  GCP  they  support  (see  Figure  1.3).    In  addition,  GCCs  may  also  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   9  prepare  SCPs  for  regions  or  functions  as  the  CCDR  considers  necessary  to  carry  out  the missions assigned to the command. 1.6.4.  Functional  Campaign  Plan  (FCP).    The  FCP  is  a  functional  CCDR’s  plan  to accomplish  strategic  or  operational  objectives  within  a  functional  responsibility  (e.g.,  US Strategic  Command  (USSTRATCOM)).    The  FCP  operationalizes  the  CCDR’s  functional strategy  and  translates  strategic  concepts  into  unified  actions.    Functional  CCDR’s  develop FCPs that integrate military engagement and security cooperation, posture, phase 0, ongoing operations, and deterrence. 1.7.  Additional Plans In Support of the Campaign Plan. 1.7.1.  Theater  Posture  Plan  (TPP).    The  TPP  describes  the  forces,  footprint,  and agreements present in a theater, and it proposes a set of posture initiatives and other posture changes, along with corresponding cost data, necessary to support DOD activities as detailed in each TCP, including the GCC’s contingency, operations, and supporting plans.  The TPP is normally an annex that supports and nests under a TCP.  Note:  Functional CCMDs do not produce  TPPs.    Instead,  US  Special  Operations  Command  (USSOCOM)  develops  a  global special  operations  forces  (SOF)  posture  plan,  USSTRATCOM  develops  a  strategic infrastructure  master  plan  (SIMP),  and  US  Transportation  Command  (USTRANSCOM) develops an en route infrastructure master plan (ERIMP). 1.7.2.  Country  Plan.  Campaign  plans  include  country-specific  security  cooperation  plans (or sections) for those countries where the CCMD intends to apply significant time, money, and  effort.    The  CCDR  country  plan  is  the  CCMD’s  primary  tool  to  synchronize  DOD security  cooperation  operations  in  support  of  GEF-defined  campaign  objectives,  campaign plan IMOs, and the Department of State (DOS) integrated country strategy (ICS). 1.7.2.1.  Security  cooperation  is  the  means  by  which  the  DOD  encourages  and  enables countries and organizations to  work with  the US to  achieve both  US  and partner nation strategic objectives.  Security cooperation encompasses all DOD interactions with foreign defense  establishments  to  build  defense  relationships  that  promote  specific  US  security interests,  develop  allied  and  friendly  military  capabilities  for  self-defense  and multinational operations, and provide US forces with peacetime and contingency access to  a  host  nation  (DOD  Directive  [DODD]  5132.03,  DOD  Policy  and  Responsibilities Relating  to  Security  Cooperation).    Note:    Although  not  formally  defined  in  joint doctrine,  the  term  “theater  security  cooperation”  is  often  used  to  differentiate  GCC-conducted security cooperation from other DOD security cooperation activities. 1.7.2.2.  The CCDR country plan: 1.7.2.2.1.  Is developed in parallel with and may nest under a CCDR campaign plan. 1.7.2.2.2.  Defines  the  security  roles  the  DOD  and  CCMD  would  like  the  partner  to play. 1.7.2.2.3.  Summarizes  DOD  objectives  related  to  partner  relationships,  partner capacities and capabilities and capacities, access, and interoperability. 1.7.2.2.4.  Sequences operations, events, and investments in time and space to achieve desired objectives and effects.   10  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 1.7.2.2.5.  May significantly exceed the two- to five-year horizon typically associated with the campaign plan. 1.7.2.2.6.  May  support  regional  approaches  that  may  be  outlined  in  the  campaign plan, in order to achieve regional economies of scale. 1.7.2.2.7.  Applies security cooperation resources toward outcomes the partner nation is able to absorb and sustain.  Plans consider measures that the CCMD or DOD could take to increase the partner nation’s ability to absorb, manage, and sustain its armed forces  and  capability  and  capacity  improvements  afforded  by  security  cooperation (e.g., defense institution building initiatives). 1.7.2.2.8.  Includes  estimates  of  the  resources  required  to  pursue  desired  security cooperation efforts. 1.7.2.2.9.  Are executed with interagency partners whenever possible. 1.8.  USAF-Defined Steady-State Strategy and Plans.  A key purpose of this AFI is to provide definitions  and  guidance  on  US  Air  Force  (USAF)  strategy,  steady-state  plans,  and  theater security cooperation plans at the commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR) level and below.  Readers  are  directed  to  USAF  operational-  and  tactical-level  doctrine  for  a  summary  of  best practices,  planning  methodologies,  design  considerations,  and  recommended  formats  related  to these  documents.    Note:    The  use  of  the  term  “COMAFFOR”  in  this  AFI  refers  to  the  USAF component commander to a CCDR. 1.8.1.  USAF  Strategy.    The  USAF  strategy  defines  a  future  path  to  ensure  the  Air  Force meets  the  needs  of  our  nation  over  the  next  30  years.    This  long  look  guides  the  20-year Strategic  Master  Plan,  which  identifies  priorities,  goals,  and  objectives  that  align  our planning  activities  with  strategic  vectors  to  produce  a  resource-informed  20-year  planning force. 1.8.2.  USAF  Campaign  Support  Plan  (CSP).    The  USAF  CSP  is  a  biennial  plan  at  the national-strategic  level,  summarizing  USAF  steady-state  operations  in  support  of  CCDR campaign  plans.    The  USAF  CSP  assessment  informs  USAF  force  planning,  capabilities development, and resource allocation.  See Chapter 3 for guidance on the USAF CSP. 1.8.3.  COMAFFOR Strategy.  COMAFFOR strategy outlines the commander’s long-term vision for the USAF component to the CCMD and provides an Airmen’s perspective on the CCDR strategy.  Strategy informs operations planning.  See Chapter  4 for guidance on the COMAFFOR strategy. 1.8.4.  COMAFFOR  CSP.    The  COMAFFOR  CSP  is  an  operations  plan  at  the  theater-strategic level, summarizing steady-state, component-specific operations in support of CCDR campaign  plans.    The  COMAFFOR  CSP  may  include  activities  related  to  the  component responsibility to organize, train, equip, and sustain Air Force forces.  The COMAFFOR CSP operationalizes the COMAFFOR strategy.  See Chapter 5 for guidance on the COMAFFOR CSP. 1.8.5.  COMAFFOR  Country  Plan.    The  COMAFFOR  country  plan  is  a  theater  security cooperation plan at the operational level that aligns with the CCDR’s country plan and nests under  the  COMAFFOR  CSP.    Country  plans  focus  on  achieving  country-level  objectives AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   11  related interoperability.  See Chapter 6 for guidance on the COMAFFOR country plan. relationships,  partner  capacities  and  capabilities,  access,  and to  partner 1.8.6.  Event  Plan.    The  event  plan  is  a  steady-state  plan  at  the  tactical  level,  outlining objectives,  a  concept  of  operations,  and  a  concept  of  support  for  an  individual  steady-state action  or  engagement.    This  internal  USAF  plan  focuses  on  how  USAF  personnel  prepare, deploy, employ, redeploy, and assess the steady-state event.  Event plans support either the COMAFFOR  CSP  or  COMAFFOR  country  plan,  depending  on  the  type  of  event.    See Chapter 7 for guidance on the event plan. 1.8.7.  Training/Capacity Plan.  The training/capacity plan is a theater security cooperation plan  at  the  tactical  level,  outlining  objectives,  a  concept  of  operations,  and  a  concept  of support  for  building  partner  capacity  or  capability.    This  plan  can  be  viewed  as  a comprehensive and highly detailed project management plan for building a partner’s capacity or  capability.    Although  training/capacity  plans  may  be  subordinate  to  the  event  plan,  this plan normally supports objectives, effects, and tasks in the COMAFFOR country plan.  See Chapter 7 for guidance on the training/capacity plan. 1.9.  Joint and Service Integration for the Steady-State.  Figure 1.4 illustrates the integration of DOD strategic  guidance, CCDR strategy, CCDR campaign plans, USAF strategy and plans, and DOS integrated country strategies in support of the steady-state campaign.  The figure also shows the linkage between the USAF CSP and the program objective memorandum (POM) via the  USAF  CSP  assessment,  force  planning,  and  capabilities  development.    These  linkages  are further  discussed  in  Chapter  3.    The  arrows  between  the  documents  depict  typical  inputs  and outputs, but do not fully represent the collaborative nature of strategy and plan development. 1.9.1.  Top-Down Strategy and Plans.  Figure 1.4 depicts a vertically integrated, top-down approach  to  strategy  development  and  operations  planning.    Consistent  with  US  military culture  and  doctrine,  strategy  and  plans  cascade  downward  along  the  chain  of  command, whereby commanders assign tasks and responsibilities to subordinate commanders and staffs.  Subordinate commanders and staffs then address those tasks and responsibilities in their own strategy  and  plans,  showing  a  clear  linkage  and  support  to  the  higher  commander’s document.  The cascading of strategy and plans flows from the CCDR to the COMAFFOR, ultimately  expressed  in  the  form  of  a  COMAFFOR  CSP  and  COMAFFOR  country  plans.  These  two  plan  types  then  inform  tactical-level  planning,  execution,  and  assessment.    The line  between  USAF  strategy  and  COMAFFOR  strategy  is  dotted  to  represent  a  transition from  a  Service-specific  organize,  train,  and  equip  strategy  to  a  USAF  theater/functional strategy with operational considerations.  In addition, the line between the COMAFFOR CSP and USAF CSP is dotted to represent a transition from operations planning to USAF-specific organize, train, and equip planning.   12  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 Figure 1.4.  Strategy and Plans for Steady-State Operations  1.9.2.  Bottom-Up  Operation  Assessment.    Assessment  is  the  continuous  process  that measures  the  overall  effectiveness  of  employing  joint  force  capabilities  during  military operations (JP 3-0).  In contrast to the top-down approach to planning, operation assessment processes flow in the reverse direction.  Tactical-level actions inform the assessment of event plans and training/capacity plans.  Tactical-level plan assessment informs the assessment of the  COMAFFOR  CSP  and/or  COMAFFOR  country  plan,  depending  on  the  type  of  event (see Paragraph 7.2.7).  COMAFFOR country plan assessment informs the assessment of the COMAFFOR CSP.  COMAFFOR CSP assessment informs the assessment of COMAFFOR strategy  and  the  CCDR’s  assessment  of  the  CCDR  campaign  plan.    Finally,  the  CCDR’s campaign plan assessment informs the assessment of the CCDR strategy, JSCP, and GEF. AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   13  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Overview.  The  USAF  CSP  is  a  biennial  plan  at  the  national-strategic  level,  summarizing USAF steady-state operations in support of CCDR campaign plans.  The USAF CSP assessment informs USAF force planning, capabilities development, and resource allocation. 3.2.  Scope. 3.2.1.  The  USAF  CSP  supports  the  Service’s  Title  10  responsibility  to  organize,  train,  and equip Air Force forces for employment by CCMDs.  As such, the plan’s primary value is to articulate  a  steady-state  demand  signal  to  sequentially  inform  institutional  force  planning, capabilities development, and resource allocation. 3.2.2.  The steady-state demand signal is derived from the assessment of COMAFFOR CSPs, COMAFFOR country plans, and the USAF CSP assessment. 3.2.3.  The  USAF  CSP  assessment,  and  associated  COMAFFOR  CSP  assessments,  is  the only  formalized  USAF  process  whereby  the  COMAFFORs  (i.e.,  Air  Force  warfighters) articulate their steady-state capability requirements for consideration by the institutional Air Force. 3.2.4.  The USAF CSP, with COMAFFOR CSPs as annexes, supports the GEF guidance to “provide  plans  for  resourcing  security  cooperation  activities  in  relevant  CCMD  AORs, including  descriptions  of  how  the  proposed  activities  support  the  achievement  of  campaign objectives.” 3.2.5.  The  USAF  CSP  provides  the  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Air  Force  (CSAF)  a  vehicle  to communicate  Service-specific  steady-state  planning  guidance  and  prioritization to COMAFFORs.    This  guidance  may  relate  to  security  cooperation,  posture,  interoperability, and other applicable organize, train, and equip issues. 3.3.  Planning Guidance. 3.3.1.  Development  Timeline.    The  USAF  CSP  is  published  biennially,  normally  in  odd years.    The  development  timeline  is  approximately  18  months  in  duration,  spanning  two calendar  years.    Refer  to  the  USAF  CSP  PLANORD  for  the  specific  dates  for  each  plan.   The development cycle includes the following steps: 3.3.1.1.  The USAF CSP OPR develops and coordinates a USAF CSP PLANORD.  The PLANORD initiates the USAF CSP and provides CSAF planning guidance and tasks to subordinate organizations. 3.3.1.2.  COMAFFORs  and  their  staffs  develop  and  coordinate  COMAFFOR  CSPs  and country plans. 3.3.1.3.  Following receipt of COMAFFOR CSPs and country plans tasked in the USAF CSP  PLANORD,  the  USAF  CSP  OPR  writes  a  base  plan  and  integrates  the  various annexes to the plan. 3.3.1.4.  The USAF CSP is coordinated and approved.  The DCS for Strategic Plans and Requirements (AF/A5/8) normally approves the plan. AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   19  3.3.1.5.  The USAF CSP OPR distributes the plan appropriately.  The plan is published to the classified USAF CSP website. 3.3.2.  Planning  Horizon.  In order to align with the planning horizon of the COMAFFOR CSPs,  CCDR  campaign  plans,  and  the  timelines  associated  with  USAF  force  planning, capabilities  development,  and  resource  allocation,  the  USAF  CSP  will  normally  be  a  five-year  plan.    The  USAF  CSP  PLANORD  will  define  the  specific  planning  years  to  be addressed in each year’s plan. and Posture  Division. 3.3.3.  Lead  Responsibility.

Classification.    The  USAF  CSP  is  a  classified  plan,  reflecting  the  highest classification of its base plan and supporting plans and annexes. 3.4.  Execution and Assessment. 3.4.1.  Execution.  The USAF CSP base plan is primarily an institutional plan that supports USAF  responsibilities  to  organize,  train,  and  equip  Air  Force  forces.    Once  the  plan  is approved, it immediately and automatically transitions into execution.  The assigned tasks in the  base  plan  guide  plan  execution.    Subordinate  USAF  organizations  work  toward  the accomplishment of their assigned tasks and report progress on those tasks when requested by HAF.  See Chapter 5 for a discussion of COMAFFOR CSP execution.   The  USAF  CSP  assessment  aligns  with  Service institutional 3.4.2.  Assessment. responsibilities,  contrasting  with  the  CCMD  operation  assessment  focused  on  GEF-defined campaign  objectives,  IMOs,  and  the  operating  environment.    Specifically,  the  USAF  CSP assessment  determines  the  adequacy  of  institutional  resources  and  capabilities  to  support component-specific  steady-state  operations  as  outlined  in  COMAFFOR  CSPs  and  further documented  in  the  assessment  of  COMAFFOR  CSPs.    The  USAF  CSP  assessment  report consolidates component assessment inputs and ultimately represents the steady-state demand signal  that  informs  institutional  force  planning,  capabilities  development,  and  resource allocation. 3.4.2.1.  The  USAF  CSP  assessment  will  be  conducted  biennially,  normally  in  even years. 3.4.2.2.  The  USAF  CSP  assessment  report  will  be  included  as  an  annex  in  the  next iteration of the USAF CSP. 3.5.  USAF CSP Outline (Notional). 3.5.1.  Base Plan. 3.5.2.

Strategy  is  a  prudent  idea  or  set  of  ideas  for  employing  the  instruments  of national  power  in  a  synchronized  and  integrated  fashion  to  achieve  theater,  national,  and/or multinational objectives (JP 3-0).  Strategy development is a responsibility of commanders at all levels.    COMAFFOR  strategy  outlines  the  commander’s  long-term  vision  for  the  USAF component to the CCMD and provides an Airmen’s perspective on the CCDR strategy. 4.2.  Scope.  The COMAFFOR strategy: 4.2.1.  Supports CCDR-issued strategy. 4.2.2.  Supports HAF-issued Air Force strategy and strategic guidance. 4.2.3.  Informs operations planning, including the COMAFFOR CSP, COMAFFOR country plans, and air operations plans. 4.2.4.  Provides guidance to subordinate commanders and improves coordination. 4.2.5.  Executes through the COMAFFOR CSP and other execution mechanisms. 4.2.6.  May  include  the  COMAFFOR’s  vision,  mission,  challenges,  priorities,  trends, assumptions, threats, opportunities, risk assessment, theater/global goals (ends), concepts of operations (ways), and resources (means). 4.2.7.  May  address  the  COMAFFOR  responsibilities  to  organize,  train,  equip,  and  sustain Air  Force  forces.    Note:    COMAFFOR  strategy  is  not  used  to  address  a  MAJCOM commander’s responsibilities to organize, train, equip, and sustain Air Force forces. 4.2.8.  Normally  emphasizes  security  cooperation  operations,  building  the  capacity  and capability of partner nations, partner relationships, interoperability, posture, and preparation for contingencies. 4.2.9.  Is informed, but not constrained, by resources available. 4.2.10.  Supports  operational  tasks  from  the  CCDR  as  articulated  in  the  CCMD  campaign plan. 4.3.  Strategy Development. 4.3.1.  Lead  Responsibility.  COMAFFOR strategy is  a product  of the COMAFFOR.  The AFFOR staff develops the strategy in close and recurring collaboration with the commander.  A lead strategist, often from the Plans and Requirements Directorate (AFFOR/A5), normally oversees development of the strategy, working in collaboration with the entire AFFOR staff, air  operations  center  (AOC),  and  subordinate  organizations.    Further  collaboration  with  the CCMD, MAJCOMs, and HAF may be necessary. 4.3.2.  Readability.  The strategy should balance the desire for a purposeful document (see Paragraph  4.2)  while  also  providing  a  concise,  readable,  and  high-level  expression  of  the commander’s  vision.    The  strategy  is  not  a  plan  and,  therefore,  is  not  executed  as  a  plan.  Instead, the strategy guides and informs subsequent operations planning.   22  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 4.3.3.  Time  Horizon.    A  key  consideration  in  strategy  development  is  the  time  horizon.  Acknowledging  strategy  informs  operations  planning,  which  generally  projects  five  years into the future, the COMAFFOR strategy should align with a similar or longer timeframe. 4.3.4.  Classification.    The  COMAFFOR  strategy  may  be  either  classified  or  unclassified.  When  classified,  COMAFFORs  are  encouraged  to  make  all  or  portions  releasable  to  key partners.  An alternative approach is to have a classified strategy that includes an unclassified supplement. 4.3.5.  Coordinating  and  Disseminating  the  COMAFFOR  Strategy.    Coordinating  the COMAFFOR  strategy  is  necessary  to  increase  transparency  and  promote  unity  of  effort within the USAF and the CCMD.  Conduct at least one round of O-6 level (general officer if non-concur)  coordination  to  the  HAF  and  applicable  MAJCOMs  prior  to  COMAFFOR approval. 4.3.5.1.  AF/A8XX  will  serve  as  the  OPR  to  coordinate  COMAFFOR  strategy  at  the HAF. 4.3.5.2.  Coordinating the COMAFFOR strategy with the parent CCMD is recommended. 4.3.5.3.  Disseminate the COMAFFOR strategy upon completion. 4.4.  Strategy  Revisions.  Consider  revisions  to  the  COMAFFOR  strategy  in  the  following conditions: 4.4.1.  When directed by the COMAFFOR. 4.4.2.  Following update of CCDR or Air Force strategy. 4.4.3.  Following significant changes to the operating environment. 4.4.4.  When COMAFFOR assessment results indicate a change is needed. 4.5.  Strategy Assessment. 4.5.1.  The  COMAFFOR  requires  the  ability  to  develop  insights,  observations,  and recommendations  related  to  the  existing  strategy,  ultimately  resulting  in  guidance  for  the future revision and adaptation of that strategy.  The AFFOR staff (normally led by the A5) supports the COMAFFOR in the assessment of strategy. 4.5.2.  The  assessment  of  strategy  should  occur  prior  to  every  revision  of  the  strategy  or annually, whichever occurs first. 4.5.3.  Strategy  is  not  assessed  as  if  it  were  an  operations  plan,  meaning  a  qualitative approach is generally more appropriate than a quantitative approach. 4.5.4.  Assessment of COMAFFOR strategy is supported by several key processes: 4.5.4.1.  Assessment of the COMAFFOR CSP. 4.5.4.2.  Assessment of deliberate plans for contingency operations. 4.5.4.3.  Risk, readiness, and posture assessments. 4.5.4.4.  Assessment of the operating environment. 4.5.4.5.  Assessment of the CCDR’s strategy and campaign plan. AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   23  4.5.4.6.

The  COMAFFOR  CSP  is  an  operations  plan  at  the  theater-strategic  level, summarizing  steady-state,  component-specific  operations  in  support  of  the  CCDR  campaign plan.    The  COMAFFOR  CSP may  include  activities  related  to  the  component  responsibility  to organize, train, equip, and sustain Air Force forces.  The COMAFFOR CSP operationalizes the COMAFFOR strategy. 5.2.  Scope.  The  COMAFFOR  CSP  is  a  steady-state  plan  that  integrates  military  engagement and  security  cooperation,  posture,  phase  0,  ongoing  operations,  and  deterrence.      Although technically  a  deliberate  plan,  COMAFFOR  CSPs  are  developed  with  the  full  expectation  they will  transition  into  execution.    This  plan  will  be  executed  to  the  degree  that  resources  (forces, funding, and authorities) are available or can be acquired.  The COMAFFOR CSP: 5.2.1.  Serves as the principal USAF supporting plan to the CCDR campaign plan. 5.2.2.  Serves  as  the  parent  plan  to  COMAFFOR  air  operations  (contingency)  plans.    As such,  the  COMAFFOR  CSP  includes  the  phase  0  shaping  actions  associated  with  each COMAFFOR-developed air operations plan. 5.2.3.  May  include  security  cooperation  (country)  plans  that  outline  desired  partner  roles, military  objectives,  and  a  specific  plan  of  action  related  to  partner  relationships,  access, building the capacity and capability of partner nations, and interoperability. 5.2.4.  May include component-specific activities related to the COMAFFOR’s responsibility to organize, train, equip, and sustain Air Force forces (e.g., readiness, exercises, etc.).  This is especially relevant to components with assigned Air Force forces.  Note:  The COMAFFOR CSP  is  not  used  to  address  a  MAJCOM  commander’s  responsibilities  to  organize,  train, equip, and sustain Air Force forces. 5.2.5.  Articulates  the  current  status  of  USAF  access  and  posture,  along  with  planned  and programmed posture initiatives.  The COMAFFOR CSP should reflect the USAF equities in the  applicable  GCC  TPP,  USSOCOM  global  SOF  posture  plan,  USSTRATCOM  SIMP,  or USTRANSCOM ERIMP. 5.2.6.  Provides justification for separately-provided Title 10 funding and manpower requests in support of steady-state operations and activities. 5.2.7.  Provides justification for CCMD-managed or -controlled Title 10 and Title 22 security cooperation funding. 5.2.8.  Provides  justification  to  request  forces  through  the  global  force  management  (GFM) system. 5.2.9.  Informs COMAFFOR risk management. 5.2.10.  Transitions  from  a  plan  to  execution  on  a  recurring  basis  (often  annually).    During execution, the COMAFFOR CSP becomes a key driver of steady-state battle rhythm for the component command. AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   25  5.2.11.  Is  not  a  security  cooperation  plan,  but  rather  a  steady-state  plan.    Security cooperation  is  clearly  within  the  scope;  however,  security  cooperation  is  not  the  singular focus of this plan. 5.2.12.  Should be synchronized with the efforts of other US government agencies. 5.2.13.  Has applicability to both geographic and functional COMAFFORs. 5.3.  Planning Guidance. 5.3.1.  Development Timeline. 5.3.1.1.  The  COMAFFOR  CSP  is  developed  in  support  of  two  higher-level  plans:    the CCDR  campaign  plan  and  the  USAF  CSP.    The  timing  of  the  COMAFFOR  CSP  is primarily influenced by the timelines associated with campaign plan development. 5.3.1.2.  The most recent COMAFFOR CSP is integrated into the USAF CSP biennially. 5.3.1.3.  The COMAFFOR CSP may be used to justify the COMAFFOR’s annual POM submission, which has its own development timeline. 5.3.2.  Planning Horizon.  The COMAFFOR CSP is a resource-dependent plan.  In order to align  with  CCDR  campaign  plans  and  the  future  years  defense  program,  the  COMAFFOR CSP  should  be  a  minimum  of  a  five-year  plan.    The  COMAFFOR  may  elect  to  extend  the planning horizon beyond five years. 5.3.3.  Lead  Responsibility.    Development  of  the  COMAFFOR  CSP  is  normally  an AFFOR/A5  lead  responsibility;  however,  the  entire  AFFOR  staff  should  be  involved  in  its development, as well as its execution and assessment. 5.3.4.  Classification.    The  COMAFFOR  CSP  is  classified  at  the  discretion  of  the COMAFFOR.    When  the  plan  is  classified,  COMAFFORs  are  encouraged  to  make  all  or portions of the plan releasable to key partners. 5.3.5.  Effects-Based Approach.  The COMAFFOR CSP will be developed using an effects-based  approach,  ensuring  planned  steady-state  operations  support  COMAFFOR-established strategy, objectives, effects, and tasks.  Geographic or functional objectives at the operational level of war are the centerpiece of the COMAFFOR CSP, enabling all subordinate planning and assessment. 5.3.5.1.  Objectives  will  be  specific,  measurable,  achievable,  relevant  and  results-oriented, and time-bound (SMART). 5.3.5.2.  Objectives  will  be  baselined  prior  to  the  development  of  an  operational approach. 5.3.5.3.  The COMAFFOR CSP links  upward to  the CCDR campaign plan, ensuring all USAF steady-state operations formally link to GEF-defined campaign objectives through the CCDR campaign plan and COMAFFOR CSP.  The precise linkage cannot be defined in  this  AFI  primarily  because  every  CCMD  develops  its  campaign  plans  differently.  However, three examples of this linkage are described below. 5.3.5.3.1.  Link COMAFFOR CSP objectives to campaign plan tasks. 5.3.5.3.2.  Link COMAFFOR CSP objectives to campaign plan IMOs.   26  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 5.3.5.3.3.  Link  COMAFFOR  CSP  objectives  to  campaign  plan  lines  of  effort,  lines of activity, or lines of operation. 5.3.5.4.  The ability to assess during plan execution will be incorporated into the plan at initial creation. 5.3.6.  Resourcing  the  CSP.    Execution  of  the  COMAFFOR  CSP  is  dependent  on  the availability  of  resources  (forces,  funding,  and  authorities);  therefore,  COMAFFOR  CSPs must articulate the requirement for resources.  CSP planning under normal conditions should be  resource-informed,  meaning  available  resources  are  considered  in  planning  but  do  not completely  constrain  the  COMAFFOR  from  outlining  a  plan  of  action  to  achieve  desired objectives.  Resource-informed planning falls between resource-unconstrained (no limits on resources)  and  resource-constrained  (limited  to  projected  resources)  planning.    Resources (forces and funding) are available to the COMAFFOR from a number of sources, to include: 5.3.6.1.  Programmed AFFOR resources. 5.3.6.2.  Component-assigned and -attached forces. 5.3.6.3.  GFM processes. 5.3.6.4.  CCMD, including access to OSD, JS, and DOS programs. 5.3.6.5.  DOD- and USAF-managed security cooperation programs. 5.3.7.  Prioritization. 5.3.7.1.  GEF-defined  campaign  objectives  are  prioritized  in  order  to  establish  an integrated  set  of  global  priorities  to  guide  overall  resource  expenditure.    CCDRs  and COMAFFORs  use  this  prioritization  to  guide  the  order  in  which  they  use  limited resources,  and  will  accept  risk  on  lower-priority  objectives  before  accepting  risk  on higher priority objectives. 5.3.7.2.  The  COMAFFOR  CSP  should  reflect  CCDR  and  COMAFFOR  priorities, acknowledging there will never be enough resources to accomplish all desired operations in the preferred timeframe.  The COMAFFOR can express priorities in a number of ways, including  the  prioritization  of  objectives,  lines  of  operation,  tasks,  partner  nations, country objectives, country tasks, and tactical-level events.  The COMAFFOR may also choose to identify a main effort. 5.3.7.3.  The COMAFFOR CSP priorities should be consistent with the CCDR-submitted integrated priority list. 5.3.8.  Risk  Management.    The  COMAFFOR  CSP  provides  a  vehicle  to  identify,  assess, manage,  and  communicate  risk  at  the  component  level.    Risk  associated  with  the COMAFFOR CSP can be articulated from at least four perspectives: 5.3.8.1.  Identify the risks of not achieving COMAFFOR objectives. 5.3.8.2.  Identify the risks associated with the projected level of resources to support the plan. 5.3.8.3.  Balance  the  risks  between  force  readiness  and  meeting  the  demands  of  the steady-state. AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   27  5.3.8.4.  Identify the risks the COMAFFOR is willing to accept. 5.3.9.  Coordinating  and  Disseminating  the  COMAFFOR  CSP.    Coordinating  and disseminating  the  COMAFFOR  CSP  improves  transparency,  synchronization,  and  unity  of effort.  Conduct at least one round of O-6 level (general officer if non-concur) coordination to the HAF and applicable MAJCOMs prior to COMAFFOR approval. 5.3.9.1.  AF/A8XX  will  serve  as  the  OPR  to  coordinate  the  COMAFFOR  CSP  at  the HAF. 5.3.9.2.  Coordinating components of the CCMD, and the TSOC is recommended. the  COMAFFOR  CSP  with the  parent  CCMD,  Service 5.3.9.3.  Disseminate the COMAFFOR CSP upon completion. 5.3.10.  Conflicting Guidance.  If HAF and CCMD guidance conflicts concerning planning for  the  steady-state,  AFFOR  staffs  should  follow  CCMD  guidance  for  operational  matters and HAF guidance for organize, train, equip, and sustain matters. 5.3.11.  Planning  Methodology  and  Formats.    See  USAF  operational-  and  tactical-level doctrine related to the COMAFFOR CSP. 5.4.  Execution and Operation Assessment. 5.4.1.  Execution. 5.4.1.1.  The  COMAFFOR  CSP  normally  transitions  into  execution  annually  to  align with  the CCMD’s campaign  execution timelines and orders.   As the COMAFFOR CSP moves  into  execution,  lead  responsibility  within  the  staff  normally  transitions  from  the AFFOR/A5 to the AFFOR/A3 (Operations Directorate), with continued support from the entire staff and AOC.  The transition from A5 to A3 may occur as early as one year prior to  execution  as  shown  in  the  notional  COMAFFOR  CSP  battle  rhythm  in  Figure  5.1.  Operation  orders  (OPORD)  or  theater  campaign  orders  (TCO)  may  be  used  to  manage execution of the plan.  Fragmentary orders may be used to task execution and implement changes to the OPORD/TCO.   28  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 Figure 5.1.  COMAFFOR CSP Battle Rhythm (Notional) 5.4.1.2.  Unless performed by the AOC, the AFFOR/A3 normally:  5.4.1.2.1.  Oversees the  COMAFFOR  CSP, COMAFFOR  country  plans,  and  event  plan  activities  and  operations  for  which adequate resources are available or have been previously acquired. tasking  and  execution  of the 5.4.1.2.2.  Provides command and control of  assigned and  attached Air  Force  forces conducting steady-state operations. 5.4.1.2.3.  Works  with  the  entire  AFFOR  staff  to  develop  execution  tasks, communicate  commander’s  intent,  assess  progress  of  operations  in  execution,  and conduct planning during execution when necessary. 5.4.1.2.4.  Communicates organizations such as the CCMD and HAF. the  status  of  steady-state  operations to  external 5.4.1.2.5.  Maintains  situational  awareness  of  non-assigned  and  non-attached  USAF forces conducting steady-state activities in the AOR. 5.4.2.  Operation  Assessment.    The  primary  purpose  of  COMAFFOR  CSP  operation assessment  is  to  inform  the  COMAFFOR  on  progress  toward  closing  the  gap  between COMAFFOR  objectives  and  their  associated  baselines.    The  assessment  serves  two secondary  purposes.    First,  it  informs  the  CCMD’s  assessment  of  IMOs,  campaign objectives,  and  operating  environment.    Second,  it  informs  the  USAF  CSP  assessment through the identification of shortfalls in resources and capabilities necessary to execute the COMAFFOR CSP, thereby informing a USAF-level dialogue about resources in support of the  steady-state.    The  assessment  influences  COMAFFOR  decision  making  with  respect  to resource  allocation,  prioritization,  future  planning  guidance,  future  strategy  revisions, AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   29  interaction with partner nations, risk management, force protection, and other potential issues involving the commander and senior leadership. 5.4.2.1.  The COMAFFOR is encouraged to share his/her CSP operation assessment with CSAF, applicable MAJCOM commanders, and applicable component commanders. 5.4.2.2.  CSP assessment processes in support of the COMAFFOR are both recurring and periodic. 5.4.2.2.1.  Recurring  Assessment.  The  AFFOR/A3  (and  AOC  when  applicable) normally  provides  the  COMAFFOR  recurring  current  operations  updates  with broader  implications  for  CSP  execution.    These  updates  may  occur  as  frequently  as daily.  Although not a complete or comprehensive assessment of plan execution and the  achievement  of  steady-state  objectives,  these  updates  provide  the  COMAFFOR important insights into the successes, failures, challenges, and issues associated with CSP execution.  Acknowledging these recurring updates support the COMAFFOR’s personal  and  continuous  assessment  of  CSP  execution,  the  AFFOR  staff  should anticipate CSP-related guidance at all times.   The  AFFOR/A5  normally  provides 5.4.2.2.2.  Periodic  Assessment. the COMAFFOR  a  comprehensive  CSP  assessment  on  a  periodic  basis.    As  the  lead developer of the CSP, the AFFOR/A5 is best qualified to summarize progress toward the  achievement  of  COMAFFOR  objectives,  effects,  and  tasks  associated  with  the CSP.    The  entire  AFFOR  staff,  and  especially  the  AFFOR/A9  (Studies,  Analyses, Assessments, and Lessons Learned Directorate), should support the A5 in this effort.  The COMAFFOR ultimately decides the frequency of the CSP assessment; however, a periodic review is recommended. 5.4.2.3.  Effects  describe  the  conditions  necessary  to  achieve  COMAFFOR  objectives.  Tasks describe friendly actions to create effects. 5.4.2.3.1.  Measures  of  effectiveness  (MOE)  are  used  to  assess  end  states  (if  used), effects, and objectives. 5.4.2.3.2.  Measures of performance (MOP) are used to assess tasks. 5.4.2.4.  The  periodic  assessment  of  the  COMAFFOR  CSP  is  supported  by  several  key assessment processes: 5.4.2.4.1.  Assessment of COMAFFOR country plans. 5.4.2.4.2.  Risk, readiness, and posture assessments. 5.4.2.4.3.  Assessment of the operating environment. 5.4.2.4.4.  Assessment of the CCDR’s strategy and campaign plan. 5.4.2.4.5.  Personal observations and insights from the commander and senior leaders. 5.4.2.4.6.  Development of an assessment annex to the COMAFFOR CSP.   30  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 Chapter 6 COMAFFOR COUNTRY PLAN 6.1.  Overview.  The  COMAFFOR  country  plan  is  a  theater  security  cooperation  plan  at  the operational  level  that  aligns  with  the  CCDR’s  country  plan  and  nests  under  the  COMAFFOR CSP.    Although  country  plans  are  primarily  associated  with  geographic  COMAFFORs, functional COMAFFORs may also develop country plans if desired.  However, USAF functional engagements  with  partner  nations  must  be  coordinated  with  the  applicable  geographic  AFFOR staff.    The  purpose  of  the  COMAFFOR  country  plan  is  to  advance  DOS,  CCMD,  and  USAF interests  and  objectives  with  regards  to  an  individual  partner  nation.    Country  plans  focus  on achieving  country-level  objectives  related  to  partner  relationships,  partner  capacities  and capabilities, access, and interoperability. 6.1.1.  Relationships.    Build  and  sustain  defense  relationships  that  promote  specific  US security interests. 6.1.2.  Partner  Capacity  and  Capability.  Develop allied and friendly military capabilities and capacities for self-defense and multinational operations. 6.1.3.  Access.  Provide US forces with peacetime and contingency access to a partner nation. 6.1.4.  Interoperability.    Promote  interoperability  in  operations,  command  and  control, equipment, doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures. 6.2.  Scope.  The COMAFFOR country plan: 6.2.1.  Is  entirely  focused  on  achieving  campaign  objectives  and  supporting  US  interests.  Security cooperation activities and relationships are not ends or objectives unto themselves.  Ideally, the country plan aligns with the intersection of US and partner objectives. 6.2.2.  Is informed by COMAFFOR strategy. 6.2.3.  Supports the COMAFFOR CSP, CCDR country plan, and DOS ICS. 6.2.4.  Identifies desired security roles the USAF would like the partner to play. 6.2.5.  Sequences activities, operations, events, and investments in time and space to achieve desired  effects.    The  most  common  security  cooperation  operations  include  military-to-military engagement, training, equipping, and exercises. 6.2.6.  Is informed by the availability of resources. 6.2.7.  Articulates resource requirements, including a demand signal for security cooperation programs and organizations. 6.2.8.  Provides justification for security cooperation funding, regardless of source (Title 10, Title 22, etc.). 6.2.9.  Provides justification to request forces through the GFM system. 6.2.10.  Transitions from a plan into execution on a periodic basis. 6.2.11.  Should include phase 0 shaping actions associated with COMAFFOR-developed air operations plans. AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   31  6.2.12.  Must  comply  with  public  laws  and  authorities  that  govern  interactions  with international  partners.  This  is  especially  relevant to  building the capacity and capability of partner nations and security assistance operations and activities. 6.3.  Planning Guidance. 6.3.1.  Development  Timeline.    The  COMAFFOR  country  plan  should  be  reviewed  and updated  periodically  because  of  the  rapidly  changing  nature  of  partner  relationships.  Frequent informal revisions may be necessary. 6.3.2.  Planning  Horizon.    The  planning  horizon  of  the  COMAFFOR  country  plan  is generally longer than the CSP, acknowledging that meaningful results may not be achievable inside  of  five  years.    Instead,  the  planning  horizon  of  this  plan  should  be  5-20  years,  with measurable results expected over the long-term. 6.3.3.  Lead Responsibility.  Development of the COMAFFOR country plan is normally an AFFOR/A5  responsibility;  however,  the  entire  AFFOR  staff  should  be  involved  in development, as well as execution and assessment.  The country desk officer in A5 performs a critical role in country plan development, execution, and assessment. 6.3.4.  Classification.    The  COMAFFOR  country  plan  is  classified  at  the  discretion  of  the COMAFFOR.    When  the  plan  is  classified,  COMAFFORs  are  encouraged  to  make  all  or portions  of  the  plan  releasable  to  key  partners.    In  many  cases,  especially  when  the  USAF desires to build the capacity and capability of partner nations, it will be necessary to share the country plan, or key elements, with the partner nation. 6.3.5.  Effects-Based Approach.  The COMAFFOR country plan will be developed using an effects-based approach, ensuring planned security cooperation events support COMAFFOR-established strategy, country objectives, effects,  and tasks.  Country-level objectives are the centerpiece  of  the  COMAFFOR  country  plan,  enabling  all  subordinate  planning  and assessment. 6.3.5.1.  Country objectives will be SMART. 6.3.5.2.  Country objectives will be baselined prior to the development of an operational approach. 6.3.5.3.  COMAFFOR  country  plans  link  upward  to  the  COMAFFOR  CSP.    Normally, country-level objectives support tasks in the COMAFFOR CSP. 6.3.5.4.  COMAFFOR  country  plans  may  include  a  summary  of  desired  security cooperation  events  in  order  to  illustrate  how  country-level  tasks  are  to  be  achieved.  Detailed planning down  to  the tactical (event) level  also facilitates the  entry of security cooperation  events  in  G-TSCMIS  and  follow-on  event-level  planning  as  discussed  in Chapter 7.  If desired, the COMAFFOR country plan may include a summary of planned and projected events from G-TSCMIS. 6.3.5.5.  The ability to assess during plan execution will be incorporated into the plan at initial creation. 6.3.6.  Resourcing the Country Plan. 6.3.6.1.  Execution of the COMAFFOR  country  plan is  dependent  on the availability  of resources;  therefore,  country  plans  must  articulate  the  requirement  for  resources.    32  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 Country  planning  under  normal  conditions  should  be  resource-informed,  meaning  that available  resources  are  considered  in  planning  but  do  not  completely  constrain  the COMAFFOR  from  outlining  a  plan  of  action  to  achieve  desired  objectives.    Resource-informed  planning  falls  between  resource-unconstrained  (no  limits  on  resources)  and resource-constrained (limited to projected resources) planning.  See Paragraph 5.3.6 for potential resources available to the COMAFFOR. 6.3.6.2.  Title  22  funds  (e.g.,  foreign  military  financing,  international  military  education and training) are part of the DOS foreign operations budget and as such are not entirely governed by DOD priorities.  DOD components, however, should work with each other, DOS,  and  other  agencies  to  develop  comprehensive,  requirements-driven  strategies,  in accordance  with  Presidential  Policy  Directive-23  (PPD-23),  Security  Sector  Assistance, that can then be resourced by the full complement of legally applicable US government activities and programs, including those funded by Title 10. 6.3.6.3.  USAF  programs  engaged  in  security  sector  assistance  activities  will  set  aside adequate  program  funds  to  conduct  assessment,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  efforts consistent with PPD-23 requirements. 6.3.7.  Prioritization. 6.3.7.1.  GEF-defined  campaign  objectives  are  prioritized  in  order  to  establish  an integrated  set  of  global  priorities  to  guide  overall  resource  expenditure.    CCDRs  and COMAFFORs  use  this  prioritization  to  guide  the  order  in  which  they  use  limited resources,  and  will  accept  risk  on  lower-priority  objectives  before  accepting  risk  on higher-priority objectives. 6.3.7.2.  The  COMAFFOR  country  plan  should  reflect  CCDR  and  COMAFFOR priorities, acknowledging there will never be enough resources to accomplish all desired operations  in  the  preferred  timeframe.    The  COMAFFOR  can  express  priorities  in  a number  of  ways,  including  the  prioritization  of  country-level  objectives,  effects,  tasks, and tactical-level events.  The COMAFFOR may also choose to identify a main effort. 6.3.8.  Coordinating  and  Disseminating   Coordinating  and disseminating  the  COMAFFOR  country  plan  improves  transparency,  synchronization,  and unity of effort.  COMAFFOR country plans may be coordinated as part of the COMAFFOR CSP or separately. the  Country  Plan. 6.3.8.1.  At a minimum, the COMAFFOR country plan should be coordinated at the O-6 level (general officer if non-concur) with the following organizations. 6.3.8.1.1.  SCO or senior defense official (SDO). 6.3.8.1.2.  CCMD, Service components to the CCMD, and the TSOC. 6.3.8.1.3.  SAF/IA. 6.3.8.1.4.  Geographic AFFOR staff (for functional COMAFFOR country plans). 6.3.8.2.  Disseminate the COMAFFOR country plan upon completion. 6.3.9.  Conflicting Guidance.  If HAF and CCMD guidance conflicts concerning operations planning  for  the  steady-state,  AFFOR  staffs  should  normally  follow  CCMD  guidance  for operational matters and HAF guidance for organize, train, equip, and sustain matters. AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   33  6.3.10.  Planning Methodology and Formats.  See USAF operational- and tactical-doctrine related to the COMAFFOR country plan. 6.4.  Execution and Operation Assessment. 6.4.1.  Execution.    The  COMAFFOR  country  plan  normally  transitions  into  execution annually to  align with  the new fiscal  year and COMAFFOR CSP execution timelines.  See Paragraph 5.4.1 for further discussion of plan execution within the AFFOR staff. 6.4.2.  Operation Assessment.  The primary purpose of country plan operation assessment is to  inform  the  AFFOR  staff  on  progress  toward  closing  the  gap  between  country  objectives and their associated baselines.  The operation assessment of COMAFFOR country plans does not  normally  include  the  direct  involvement  of  the  COMAFFOR;  however,  country  plan assessments  are  still  important  because  they  inform  CSP  assessment  and  COMAFFOR decision making. 6.4.2.1.  The  AFFOR/A5  normally  takes  the  lead  on  assessing  country  plans,  supported by  the  entire  AFFOR  staff  and  subordinate/supporting  organizations.    The  AFFOR/A5 ultimately decides the frequency of country plans assessment; however, a periodic review is recommended. 6.4.2.2.  Effects  describe  the  conditions  necessary  to  achieve  country  objectives.    Tasks describe friendly actions to create country effects. 6.4.2.2.1.  MOEs  are  used  to  assess  country  end  states  (if  used),  country  objectives, and country effects. 6.4.2.2.2.  MOPs are used to assess country tasks. 6.4.2.3.  The  assessment  of  COMAFFOR  country  plans  is  supported  by  several  key processes: 6.4.2.3.1.  Assessment of event plans. 6.4.2.3.2.  Assessment of the CCDR country plan. 6.4.2.3.3.  Assessment of the DOS ICS along with feedback from the SCOs. 6.4.2.3.4.  Assessment of the operating environment. 6.4.2.3.5.  Personal  observations  and  insights  from  the  AFFOR  staff  directors  and senior leaders. 6.4.2.3.6.  Development of an assessment annex to the COMAFFOR country plan.   34  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 Chapter 7 EVENT PLAN 7.1.  Overview.  The event plan is a steady-state plan at the tactical level, outlining objectives, a concept  of  operations,  and  a  concept  of  support  for  an  individual  steady-state  action  or engagement.    This  internal  USAF  plan  focuses  on  how  USAF  personnel  prepare,  deploy, employ, redeploy, and assess the steady-state event.  Event plans support either the COMAFFOR CSP or COMAFFOR country plan, depending on the type of event. 7.2.  Scope.  The event plan: 7.2.1.  Is a detailed operations plan for a specific or discrete steady-state engagement. 7.2.2.  Is an internal USAF plan focused on how USAF personnel prepare, deploy, employ, redeploy, and assess a steady-state event.  For security cooperation events, the event plan is not shared with the partner nation. 7.2.3.  Builds  the  linkage  between  the  tactical  action  (event)  and  the  COMAFFOR’s operational-level  plan  (country  plan)  or  the  COMAFFOR’s  theater-strategic-level  plan (CSP).  This vertical linkage is vital because it provides top-down purpose to the event and enables bottom-up operation assessment of the steady-state campaign. 7.2.4.  May  be  supplemented  with  a  subordinate  or  related  plan  that  focuses  entirely  on  a partner  nation  (e.g.,  training  plan,  building  capacity/capability  plan,  etc.).    See  Paragraph 7.4. 7.2.5.  Articulates  preparation,  training,  rehearsal,  funding,  equipment,  force  protection, logistics, command relationships, and other requirements necessary for event execution and assessment. 7.2.6.  Is developed by any organization or individual formally tasked for the execution and assessment of a steady-state event. 7.2.7.  Supports  a  variety  of  different  steady-state  operations,  with  security  cooperation  and exercises  being  the  most  common.    Security  cooperation  event  plans  normally  support COMAFFOR country plans while exercise events plans normally support the COMAFFFOR CSP. 7.2.8.  May  not  be  required  for  all  steady-state  events  due  to  the  event’s  importance, significance, scope, cost, etc. 7.2.9.  Must  comply  with  public  laws  and  authorities  that  govern  interactions  with international  partners  (T-0).    This  is  especially  relevant  to  building  the  capacity  and capability of partner nations and security assistance events. 7.2.10.  May be executed and funded using a variety of authorities and programs, including Title 10, Title 22, and others. 7.3.  Planning Guidance. 7.3.1.  Development Timeline.  Event plans are often developed at the request or tasking by the  AFFOR  staff.    The  plan  normally  applies  to  a  single  steady-state  event  or  a  series  of related events. AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   35  7.3.2.  Planning Horizon.  The planning horizon of the event plan is the expected duration of event planning, preparation, execution, assessment, and after action reporting. 7.3.3.  Lead  Responsibility.    For  security  cooperation  events,  the  AFFOR/A5  is  normally responsible  for  identifying  the  executing  organization,  tasking  the  event  plan,  obtaining required resources, and providing COMAFFOR planning, execution, and assessment policy, guidance and commander’s intent.  For exercises, the AFFOR/A3 is normally responsible for these actions.  The executing organization, which may be allocated via the GFM process, is ultimately responsible to the AFFOR/A5 or A3 for the development of the event plan.  The organization  responsible  for  planning  may  also  lead  event  execution  and  assessment.    Air advisors are uniquely qualified to develop event plans for security cooperation events. 7.3.4.  Classification.  The event plan is normally unclassified. 7.3.5.  Effects-Based  Approach.    The  event  plan  will  be  developed  using  an  effects-based approach, ensuring events support COMAFFOR-established strategy, objectives, effects, and tasks  (T-3).    Event-level  objectives  are  the  centerpiece  of  the  event  plan,  enabling  all subordinate planning and assessment. 7.3.5.1.  Event-level objectives will be SMART and developed in collaboration with the AFFOR staff. 7.3.5.2.  Event  objectives  will  be  baselined  prior  to  the  development  of  an  operational approach. 7.3.5.3.  Event  tasks  will  be  used  to  support  event  objectives.    Note:    End  states  and effects are not normally used in tactical-level planning. 7.3.5.4.  Normally, event-level objectives support tasks in the COMAFFOR country plan (security  cooperation)  or  the  COMAFFOR  CSP  (exercises),  and  are  developed  by  the planning organization in coordination with the AFFOR staff. 7.3.5.5.  Event  plans  may  be  organized  by  phases.    For  illustration,  a  single  event  plan may  include  phases  for  planning,  preparation,  site  survey,  baseline  assessment, deployment, employment, redeployment, assessment, and after action reporting. 7.3.5.6.  The ability to assess during plan execution will be incorporated into the plan at initial creation. 7.3.6.  Resourcing  the  Event  Plan.    Normally,  event-level  resources  are  acquired  and provided by the AFFOR staff as part of the effort to resource the COMAFFOR CSP and/or country plan.  Paragraph 5.3.6 discusses AFFOR staff options for acquiring the resources to support steady-state events. 7.3.7.  Coordinating  and  Disseminating  the  Event  Plan.    When  the  AFFOR  staff  tasks development of an event plan, they may state their expectations for coordination of the event plan (or subordinate plans as described in Paragraph 7.2.4) prior to execution. 7.3.7.1.  It is recommended the event plan be coordinated with the SCO or SDO. 7.3.7.2.  Event  plans  can  be  entered  in  G-TSCMIS  to  provide  visibility  for  the  entire security cooperation community.   36  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 7.3.8.  G-TSCMIS.    The  organization  responsible  for  security  cooperation  event  planning, execution, and assessment will work with the AFFOR staff to ensure event details are entered into G-TSCMIS (T-3). 7.3.9.  Foreign  Disclosure  and  Technology  Transfer.    For  security  cooperation  events, planners  must  comply  with  public  laws,  policy,  and  guidance  related  to  foreign  disclosure and technology transfer (T-0). 7.3.10.  Theater, Country, and Special Area Clearance.  For security cooperation events, planners  must  obtain  theater,  country,  and  special  area  clearance  IAW  the  DOD  Foreign Clearance  Guide  (T-0).    The  Aircraft  Personnel  and  Automated  Clearance  System  will normally be used to obtain these clearances (T-0). 7.3.11.  Planning  Methodology  and  Formats.  See USAF tactical-level  doctrine related to the event plan (Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures [AFTTP] 3-4.5, Air Advising). 7.4.  Training/Capacity Plan. 7.4.1.  Overview.  A training/capacity plan is a security cooperation plan at the tactical level, outlining  objectives,  a  concept  of  operations,  and  a  concept  of  support  for  building  partner capacity  or  capability.    In  contrast  to  the  event  plan  that  focuses  on  the  specifics  of  how Airmen  execute  and  assess  an  individual  engagement  event,  the  training/capacity  plan  is entirely focused on the partner nation.  It can be viewed as a very comprehensive and highly detailed project management plan for building a partner’s capacity or capability.  A detailed training/capacity  plan  implements,  from  a  building  partner  capacity/capability  perspective, the applicable portions of the COMAFFOR country plan. 7.4.2.  Scope.  The training/capacity plan: 7.4.2.1.  Will  be  developed,  executed,  and  assessed  in  collaboration  with  the  partner nation (T-3).  Partner nation buy-in and acceptance of the plan are essential.  As a result, this plan may be unclassified. 7.4.2.2.  Is  developed  for  the  sole  purpose  of  building  a  specific  capacity  or  capability within a partner nation.  Multiple training/capacity plans may be necessary for a partner nation.  A single training/capacity plan may support multiple events. 7.4.2.3.  May  be  used  to  build  a  partner’s  capacity  or  capability  at  the  tactical-, operational-, or strategic-level of war. 7.4.2.4.  Is normally developed by the organization or individual formally tasked with the responsibility to build partner capacity or capability.  Air advisors are uniquely qualified to develop, execute, and assess training/capacity plans. 7.4.2.5.  May  require  the  integration  of  doctrine,  organization,  training,  materiel,  leader development and education, personnel,  facilities, and policy in order to build a capacity or capability. 7.4.2.6.  Will  be  developed  using  an  effects-based  approach  (T-3).    Objectives  are  the centerpiece of the training/capacity plan.  See Paragraph 7.3.5. 7.4.2.7.  Although  it  may  be  subordinate  to  an  event  plan,  the  training/capacity  plan primarily supports COMAFFOR country plan objectives, effects, and tasks. AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   37  7.5.  Execution and Operation Assessment. 7.5.1.  Execution.  Event and training/capacity plans normally transition into execution at the direction of the AFFOR/A3.  See  Paragraph  5.4.1 for further discussion of plan execution within the AFFOR staff. 7.5.2.  Operation  Assessment.    The  primary  purpose  of  event  and  training/capacity  plan operation  assessment  is  to  inform  the  AFFOR  staff  on  progress  toward  closing  the  gap between objectives and their associated baselines.  If objectives were achieved, the AFFOR staff must make a judgment if the originating task(s) in the higher plan (country plan or CSP) have been achieved.  If objectives were not achieved or only partially achieved, the AFFOR staff must make a judgment on how best to proceed, including the possibility of repeating an event,  restructuring  a  future  event(s),  updating  the  country  plan  or  CSP,  or  pursuing  other options. 7.5.2.1.  Event-level (tactical) plans do not normally require the planning and assessment rigor  of  operational-level  and  theater-strategic-level  plans.    The  complexity  of  building partner  capacity  and  capability  necessitates  a  comprehensive,  detailed  training/capacity plan. 7.5.2.1.1.  MOEs are used to assess objectives and effects (if used). 7.5.2.1.2.  MOPs are used to assess tasks. 7.5.2.2.  The  results  of  event  and  training/capacity  operation  assessment  are  normally documented as part of an after action report. 7.5.2.3.  For security  cooperation events,  the  results of event-level  operation assessment should be entered in G-TSCMIS. 7.5.2.4.  The assessment of the event and training/capacity plans is supported by several key processes: 7.5.2.4.1.  Data collection during event execution. 7.5.2.4.2.  Analysis of the data collected during event execution. 7.5.2.4.3.  Personal  observations  and  insights  by  the  individual(s)  responsible  for event planning and execution. 7.5.2.4.4.  Development of an assessment annex to the event plan.  JAMES M.

Assessment—1) A continuous process that measures the overall effectiveness of employing joint force  capabilities  during  military  operations;  2)    Determination  of  the  progress  toward accomplishing a task, creating a condition, or achieving an objective (JP 3-0). Campaign—A  series  of  related  major  operations  aimed  at  achieving  strategic  and  operational objectives within a given time and space (JP 5-0). AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015   41  COMAFFOR  Campaign  Support  Plan—An  operations  plan  at  the  theater-strategic  level, summarizing  steady-state,  component-specific  operations  in  support  of  CCDR  campaign  plans.  The  COMAFFOR  CSP  may  include  activities  related  to  the  component  responsibility  to organize, train, equip, and sustain Air Force forces.  The COMAFFOR CSP operationalizes the COMAFFOR strategy. COMAFFOR  Country  Plan—A theater security cooperation plan at the operational level that aligns  with  the  CCDR’s  country  plan  and  nests  under  the  COMAFFOR  CSP.    Country  plans focus  on  achieving  country-level  objectives  related  to  partner  relationships,  partner  capacities and capabilities, access, and interoperability. COMAFFOR Strategy—COMAFFOR strategy outlines the commander’s long-term vision for the  USAF  component  to  the  CCMD  and  provides  an  Airmen’s  perspective  on  the  CCDR strategy. Contingency  Plan—A  plan  for  major  contingencies  that  can  reasonably  be  anticipated  in  the principal geographic subareas of the command (JP 5-0). Deterrence—The  prevention  of  action  by  the  existence  of  a  credible  threat  of  unacceptable counteraction and/or belief that the cost of action outweighs the perceived benefits (JP 3-0). Event  Plan—A  steady-state  plan  at  the  tactical  level,  outlining  objectives,  a  concept  of operations, and a concept  of support for an individual steady-state action  or engagement.  This internal  USAF  plan  focuses  on  how  USAF  personnel  prepare,  deploy,  employ,  redeploy,  and assess the steady-state event.  Event plans support either the COMAFFOR CSP or COMAFFOR country plan, depending on the type of event. Functional Campaign Plan—A functional CCDR’s plan to accomplish strategic or operational objectives  within  a  functional  responsibility.    The  FCP  operationalizes  the  CCDR’s  functional strategy and translates strategic concepts into unified actions. Global  Campaign  Plan—A  GCP  is  developed  when  the  scope  of  contemplated  military operations  exceeds  the  authority  or  capabilities  of  a  single  CCDR  to  plan  and  execute.    GCPs establish the strategic and operational framework within which SCPs are developed. Integrated  Country  Strategy—A  core  organizing  document  for  all  US  government  foreign assistance  to  a  country,  including  development  assistance  and  security  sector  assistance.    Its purpose  is  to  promote  unity  of  effort  and  more  proactive,  strategic,  and  efficient  interagency planning to achieve US national security objectives. Military  Engagement  and  Security  Cooperation—Shaping  actions that  strengthen relationships  with  international  and  domestic  partners,  secure  access  for  peacetime  and contingency  operations,  build  the  capacity  and  capability  of  partner  nations,  and  promote interoperability. Ongoing  Operations—Steady-state  military  operations  conducted  in  support  of  CCDR objectives, but not specifically linked to an OPLAN or CONPLAN. Phase  0—Shaping  actions  specifically  linked  to  a  contingency  plan,  either  an  OPLAN  or CONPLAN. Posture—The  US  forces  and  capabilities  forward  stationed  and  rotationally  deployed  for defense  activities  in  foreign  countries  and  US  territories  overseas,  as  well  as  the  network  of   42  AFI10-421  25 JUNE 2015 bases, infrastructure, and international agreements and arrangements that underwrite and support the stationing, deployment, and employment of these forces. Security  Cooperation—The  means  by  which  DOD  encourages  and  enables  countries  and organizations  to  work  with  the  US  to  achieve  strategic  objectives.    Security  cooperation encompasses  all  DOD  interactions  with  foreign  defense  establishments  to  build  defense relationships  that  promote  specific  US  security  interests,  develop  allied  and  friendly  military capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and provide US forces with peacetime and contingency access to a host nation (DODD 5132.03). Shape—Steady-state  actions  focused  on  influencing  the  environment  in  order  to  prevent  and deter  future  conflict,  mitigate  operational  risks,  and  strengthen  US  and  partner  capabilities  to respond to major operations, campaigns, crisis response, and limited contingencies. Steady-State—A  stable  condition  involving  continuous  and  recurring  operations  and  activities with  simultaneous  absence of major military, crisis response, and contingency operations.  The steady-state  is  characterized  by  shaping  operations  and  activities  at  a  relatively  low  level  of intensity, urgency, and commitment of military forces. Strategy—A prudent idea or set of ideas for employing the instruments  of national power in a synchronized and integrated fashion to achieve theater, national, and/or multinational objectives (JP 3-0). Subordinate Campaign  Plan—A CCMD prepared plan that satisfies the requirements under a DOD  GCP,  which,  depending  upon  the  circumstances,  transitions  to  a  supported  or  supporting plan in execution. Theater  Campaign  Plan—A  GCC’s  plan  to  accomplish  strategic  or  operational  objectives within a geographic AOR.  The TCP operationalizes the CCDR’s theater strategy and translates strategic concepts into unified actions. Theater Posture Plan—Describes the forces, footprint, and agreements present in a theater, and it proposes a set of posture initiatives and other posture changes, along with corresponding cost data,  necessary  to  support  DOD  activities  as  detailed  in  each  TCP,  including  the  GCC’s contingency, operations, and supporting plans. Training/Capacity  Plan—A  theater  security  cooperation  plan  at  the  tactical  level,  outlining objectives,  a  concept  of  operations,  and  a  concept  of  support  for  building  partner  capacity  or capability.  This plan can be viewed as a comprehensive and highly detailed project management plan  for  building  a  partner’s  capacity  or  capability.    Although  training/capacity  plans  may  be subordinate  to  the  event  plan,  this  plan  normally  supports  objectives,  effects,  and  tasks  in  the COMAFFOR country plan. USAF  Campaign  Support  Plan—A  biennial  plan  at  the  national-strategic  level,  summarizing USAF steady-state operations in support of CCDR campaign plans.  The USAF CSP assessment informs USAF force planning, capabilities development, and resource allocation.
