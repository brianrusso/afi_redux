This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources and minimum requirements for the Security Forces (SF) officer specialty.  The CFETP will provide a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.    2.  The CFETP consists of two parts.  Supervisors plan, manage and control training within the specialty using both parts of the plan.   2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how to use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, experience and other mandatory requirements); and Section D indicates resource constraints.  Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment and facilities.   2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the Course Training Standard (CTS) for the common formal courses SF officers attend throughout their career.  Section B contains a training course index officers and supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Section C describes how to use the Specialty Training Standard (STS).  Section D identifies available support materials.  Air Force Security Forces Center (AFSFC) produced electronic Tactics, Techniques and Procedure Guides (eTTPG) are an example of support materials.  Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  3.  The guidance provided in this CFETP will ensure individuals in the SF officer specialty receive effective and efficient training at appropriate points in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today's SF officers to protect and defend our resources against current and emerging threats.     1 ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Training (AT).

This CFETP provides the information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFM), training management, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training individuals in this Air Force Specialty (AFS) should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  For purposes of this plan, training is divided into initial skills and development level training.  Initial skills training is the training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force.  AETC provides this training at Lackland AFB TX for AFSC 31P1.  Development level training is designed to provide officers with the knowledge and skill required for the next step in their career path.  There are four SF Officer Development Levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an officer in a specific duty position.    2.  Use.  MFMs and supervisors at all levels will use this plan to develop comprehensive and cohesive training programs for each individual in the SF officer specialty.  2.1.  AETC training personnel develop and revise formal resident and exportable training based upon requirements established by users and documented in Part II of this CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2.  The MFMs will ensure MAJCOM training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial skills and development level requirements.  A combination of OJT, resident training, contract training or exportable courseware and courses is necessary to satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOMs must identify MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFS for inclusion in this plan.  2.3.  HQ AFSFC develops publications on specific SF subjects, procedures or equipment.  MAJCOMs or local units select and supplement these publications to fit their needs.  2.4.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II and the Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) provide a reference to support training.    3.  Coordination and Approval.  HQ AFSFC/SFOT develops this CFETP.  The approval authority is the Security Forces Officer Career Field Manager (SFOCFM).  MFMs and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The SFOCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.

The 31P career field has three qualification levels designated by an Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC).  The fourth position the alphanumeric AFSC indications qualification level.   The three security force officer AFSCs are 31P1, 31P3 and 31P4.  The three qualification levels follow the standard format used for most officer career fields (see AFI 36-2101 for more information on officer AFSC designations).  Adequate training and timely progression from entry to the qualified level play an important role in the AF‟s ability to accomplish its mission.  A sampling of activities for each AFSC is listed below.  2.1.  Entry (1) Level.  AFSC 31P1 is awarded upon assignment to the SF career field.  31P1 officers attend the SF Officer Course (SFOC) and participate in an OJT program centered on the Development Level (DL)1 and 2 tasks listed in the 31PX Specialty Training Standard (STS).   6 31P1 officers may also require home station training to meet local duty position certification requirements.  Major duties include leading flight sized elements and assisting in one of the unit‟s S-functions.  These officers also complete the appropriate Professional Military Education.    2.2.  Qualified (3) Level.  AFSC 31P3 is awarded when an officer meets the requirements listed in Section C.  31P3 officers attend the Security Forces Advanced Officer Course (SFAOC) and Integrated Defense Command and Control Course (IDC3).  Additionally, most 31P3 officers pursue graduate degrees and complete the appropriate level of PME.  31P3 officers are assigned duties at all levels including squadron commander.  These officers continue OJT and self-directed training in the DL 3 and 4 tasks listed in the 31 PX STS.  2.3.  Staff (4) Level.  AFSC 31P4 is awarded when an officer who holds the 31P3 AFSC is assigned to a staff position above wing level.  31P4 level officers work in functional areas on Numbered Air Force, MAJCOM, and HQ AF staff agencies.     2.4.  Development Levels (DL).  Four DLs are used to categorize officers in terms of knowledge, training and experience.  The 31P1 officer should progress through the DL 1 and DL 2 categories.  The 31P3 officer should progress through DL 3 and DL 4 categories.   Specific requirements and expected times for each DL are in Section C.  3.  Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the SF career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  Effective training programs are keys to ensuring officers reach each level in the development process.  It is essential everyone involved in training does his or her part to plan, manage and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives useful training at appropriate points in their career.    3.1.  Initial Skills.  Initial and entry level training requirements are identified by a SF Specialty Training and Requirements Team (STRT) and a Utilization and Training Workshop (UTW).  Subsequently, courses are developed and taught by AETC and other training venues designated by the SF Officer Career Field Manager with input from the STRT and UTW.    3.2.  Upgrade Requirements.  The following training is required for award of the 31P3 AFSC:  completion of the SFOC and demonstrated task proficiency in all Development Level 1 and 2 tasks on the 31PX STS.  3.3.  Proficiency Training.  SF officers achieve job task proficiency through a combination of formal courses and OJT.  Formal courses provide task training to meet a specified standard identified by a proficiency code (see chart below).  The SFOCFM and other members of the Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT) use the PCK code to designate the level of training provided in a formal course.  Tasks are identified as either subject knowledge only or those requiring task performance and task knowledge.  Subject knowledge only tasks are generally listed by subject area.  For example:  the SFOC includes a task named “Security Forces  7 Culture.”  This task is coded:  “A.”  Using the chart, you will see that this task requires the student to identify basic facts of Security Forces Culture.  Items requiring task performance and task knowledge are usually stated with a verb.  For example the task:  “Conduct Guardmount” with a PCK code of “3c” will require the student to actually hold a guardmount and describe the purposes and features of guardmount.  Most formal courses are not designed to prepare a person to do all aspects of a job task without some form of OJT.  Even tasks taught to the 3c level will require some home station training due to specific local requirements not discussed in the formal class setting.  All SF officers must meet the “Go” level of proficiency for home station duty tasks.   3.3.1.  “Go” Level.  Formal training courses rarely develop students to the task performance level 3 (competent) on every task.  Officers must engage in OJT to reach at least the “Go” level  8 Proficiency Code Key  Scale Value Definition:  The individual  1 Can do simple parts of the task.  Needs to be told or shown how to do most of the task.  (Extremely Limited) Task 2 Can do most parts of the task.  Needs only help on hardest parts.  (Partially Proficient) Performance 3 Can do all parts of the task.  Needs only a spot check of completed work.  (Competent) Levels 4 Can do the complete task quickly and accurately.  Can tell or show others how to do the task.  (Highly Proficient)  a Can name parts, tools and simple facts about the task.  (Nomenclature) *Task b Can determine step by step procedures for doing the task.  (Procedures) Knowledge c Can identify why and when the task must be done and why each step is needed. (Operating Principles) Levels d Can predict, isolate and resolve problems about the task.  (Advanced Theory)  A Can identify basic facts and terms about the subject.  (Facts) **Subject B Can identify relationship of basic facts and state general principles about the subject.  (Principles) Knowledge C Can analyze facts and principles and draw conclusions about the subject.  (Analysis) Levels D Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject.  (Evaluation) Explanations *  A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.  (Example:  b and 1b)  **  A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task or for a subject common to several tasks.  -  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no training is provided in a course.  However OJT or home station training is still required.     NOTE:  All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time. of performance on all required tasks.  AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, provides this definition for the “Go” level:  “Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures (“Go” level equates to 3c in the STS proficiency code key).”  3.3.2.  Supervisors conduct OJT or appoint trainers to ensure officers reach the “Go” level on all performance tasks.  OJT and extensive work experience is also essential to reach the analysis (code C) and evaluation (code D) levels for subject knowledge tasks.  Supervisors and trainers determine the level of subject knowledge an officer requires based on the officer‟s duty requirements.   3.3.3.  The Air Force, sister services and other government departments offer courses that may enhance an officer‟s proficiency.  SF officers and their supervisors should develop an individualized training plan that will broaden the officer‟s capabilities.  Part II, Section B, lists several courses that may be helpful when developing individual training plans. 4.  Career Field Path.  SF officers are part of the support officer structure.  Career paths in this arena will help you to plan and achieve career goals.  There are no definitive, concrete steps that need to be attained to reach rank or position; however, certain jobs or experiences, training and PME will help you in achieving your goals.  Future SF leaders will be those who achieve depth and breadth through job experience, education and training, and professional development.  A solid foundation in these areas will pay high dividends in your future.  Failure to build your foundation at the appropriate time may, in effect, close certain doors for advancement later in your career.  In other words, your development as a future Air Force leader begins now.  The AF first and foremost needs leaders and all SF officers should put themselves on a course to eventually compete for a command position at the squadron or group level.  Figure 1, 31P Career Path Pyramid, illustrates the typical career field milestones for SF officers.  9       Figure 1.  SECTION C - Proficiency Training Requirements 1.  Purpose.  Proficiency training requirements in the SF Officer Career Field are defined in terms of tasks and knowledge requirements.  This section outlines the specialty qualification requirements for award of AFSCs 31P1, 31P3 and 31P4.  It introduces SF Officer Development Levels (DL) and associated knowledge, performance and experience requirements.  The specific task and knowledge training requirements are identified in the 31PX STS at the appendix.  2.  Specialty Qualification.   2.1.

Implementation.  The 31PX STS at the appendix identifies the tasks an SF officer is expected to master over their career.  When requested by the SFOC FM, AETC or other training providers will use this STS to develop training and officer development courses.   2.  Use.  An “X” in one of the columns labeled DL (1, 2, 3, and 4) indicates the task is required for that development level.  Some tasks are required at multiple development levels.  Training for each task must be designed to prepare the officer to perform the task at that development level.  For example, the task “Principles of Leadership” is a training task at the DL 1, DL 3 and DL 4 levels.  By referencing the career path pyramid, you can see that a DL 1 officer serves as a flight commander/leader.  However, an officer training to reach DL 3 may be an operations officer preparing to be a squadron commander.  While both require leadership knowledge, a DL 3 officer applies that knowledge and skill considering the entire squadron.  Therefore, training this task at the DL 3 should include scenarios involving squadron leadership.  In this example, the “Go” proficiency standard is expressed differently for the same task because the scope of the jobs requiring the task is different.  2.1.  The 31PX STS becomes a Job Qualification Standard if supplemented with a home station AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation.  This usually applies when the duty position requires a duty position evaluation.   24 3.  Documentation.  For DL 1-3, document completion of training using the electronic Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  As a minimum, complete the following areas:  Training Start, Training Complete, Trainee Initials and Trainer Initials.  Enter an AF 623a, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, entry when the officer has completed the requirements for a Development Level 1-3.  Development Level 4 training tasks are self-managed and do not require documentation in the AFTR.  3.1.  Decertification and Recertification.  If an officer is found to be unqualified on a previously certified task, the supervisor deletes the previous certification.  Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623a, as to the reason for decertification.  The supervisor or trainer will initiate retraining on this task by entering a new training start date.  Once the retraining is complete, enter a new training complete date.  Both the trainer and trainee must enter their initials.  SECTION D - Support Materials:  OJT Support materials consist of Air Force publications (AFI, AFMANs, AFHs), Joint Publications, Sister Service Field Manuals, Technical Orders (T.O.) and electronic Tactics Techniques and Procedure Guides (eTTPG).  The eTTPGs can be found on the SF-CTE Web Page (https://sf-cte.csd.disa.mil). These documents contain comprehensive information on SF subjects, procedures or equipment.

(Principles) Can analyze facts and principles and draw conclusions about the subject.  (Analysis) Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject.  (Evaluation) Explanations *  A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.  (Example:  b and 1b)  **  A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task or for a subject common to several tasks.    NOTE:  The Proficiency Code Key will be used after formal courses are developed.  The code will designate the task level of training in the formal course(s).  These codes only apply to the formal training environment.  OJT is the method used to bring officers to the “Go” level of proficiency to meet duty requirements.     A-2 APPENDIX  CODES DESCRIPTION Behavioral Statement Codes P K pk X - Performance Training - Identifies that the individual has performed the task to the satisfaction of the course; however, the individual may not be capable of meeting the field requirements for speed and accuracy.  Subject Knowledge Training - The verb selection identifies the individual„s ability to identify facts, state principles, analyze, or evaluate the subject.  Performance Knowledge Training - The verb selection identifies the individual„s ability to relate simple facts, procedures, operating principles, and operational theory for the task. Performance Knowledge Training is required but not yet part of a formal course.  (Note:  All DL tasks marked with an “X.” will be replaced with either Proficiency Codes or Behavioral Statement Codes when the task is included in a course.) Training is required but the item is not included in a formal training course.  Training will be conducted through OJT or home station training.
