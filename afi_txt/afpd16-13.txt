BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCEAIR FORCE POLICY DIRECTIVE 16-131 MARCH 2000Certified Current, 2 June 2010Operations SupportSURVIVAL, EVASION, RESISTANCE, ANDESCAPE (SERE)NOTICE: This publication is available digitally on the AFDPO WWW site at: http://afpubs.hq.af.mil.OPR: HQ USAF/XOOP  (CMSgt Sterling J. Murray) Certified by: HQ USAF/XOO(Maj Gen Michael S. Kudlacz)Pages: 6Distribution: FThis AFPD implements DoD Directive 1300.7, Training and Education Measures Necessary to Supportthe Code of Conduct (CoC) and DoD Directive 2310.2, Personnel Recovery. The USAF SERE Programprepares Low to High Risk of Capture (LRC)/(HRC) personnel to return with honor in direct support ofDOD and Air Force Personnel Recovery (PR) directives.  Ensuring SERE operations and training are anormalized part of USAF Personnel Recovery plans and programs provides for a well prepared, missionoriented and motivated force who are confident in their ability to survive and return with honor. Toaccomplish this, the Air Force requires a robust SERE program managed by a SERE Specialist at theMAJCOM level and conducted by a well trained, fully manned SERE Specialist force at the formalschools and select operational units. This directive establishes policies for the conduct of the USAF SEREprogram and identifies the capabilities of SERE Specialists.1. The USAF SERE program is an integral part of PR. SERE operations and training are designed to pre-pare and enable combat aircrews and other HRC personnel to survive and return with honor. Initial,advanced, and recurring SERE training programs provide essential skills and knowledge in support of theCode of Conduct for all low to high risk of capture personnel.  Unit level SERE Code of Conduct Contin-uation Training (CoCCT) and Evasion and Recovery (E&R) operations support programs must provide aclear and continual link between initial formal training and actual operations throughout a memberâ€™scareer.  2. SERE Specialists are a critical component of PR and Aircrew Protection programs responsible for pre-paring designated personnel to survive, evade, resist and escape, ultimately resulting in the recovery ofisolated personnel. SERE Specialists develop SERE Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) in supportof operational tasking for theater and Joint Forces Commanders. Air Force SERE Specialists are the onlyDoD specialty specifically recruited, trained and employed to conduct SERE operations support and Codeof Conduct Training (CoCT) for the duration of their career. SERE Specialists conduct CoCT and CoCCTin support of DoD Directive 1300.7, Training and Education Measures Necessary to Support the Code ofConduct.  SERE Specialists are qualified in principles of PR, and uniquely qualified in global SERE TTPand equipment enabling them to function as subject matter experts (SME) during contingency, wartimeand military operations other than war (MOOTW).  SERE Specialist capabilities include but are not lim-2AFPD16-13   1 MARCH 2000ited to: SME on impact of conditions effecting survival, evasion, conduct after capture and resistance toexploitation, escape from captivity; wilderness emergency medical technician (EMT); PR Tactics, Tech-niques, and Procedures (TTP); operational testing support and use of SERE related equipment; basic,advanced and emergency military parachuting; controller/observer, evader/evader escort during PR exer-cises.3. SERE Program requirements are based on the following guidelines:3.1. The USAF SERE Program will be conducted IAW DoD Directive 1300.7, Training and Educa-tion Measures Necessary to Support the Code of Conduct, DoD Directive 2310.2, Personnel Recovery(PR), and CJCSI 3270.01, Personnel Recovery within the Department of Defense. Cooperationbetween SERE, Pararescue, Intelligence, Aircrew Life Support, Egress, Survival Equipment, Aero-space Physiology, and legal programs will ensure the success of the USAF SERE Program.  Addition-ally, the SERE program management should be a coordinated effort facilitated by a 1T0X1, SERESpecialist qualified in accordance with AFMAN 36-2108.3.2. SERE Specialists will be qualified as a worldwide deployable resource capable of supportingoperations in any theater as a SME in support of PR/SERE operations.4. The following responsibilities and authorities are established:4.1. The Secretary of the Air Force establishes policy for the SERE Program.  HQ USAF/XO hasfunctional oversight responsibility for the SERE Program and SERE Specialist career field manage-ment.  Specifically, HQ USAF/XO will establish and approve guidance pertaining to SERE operationsand training and the employment of SERE Specialists. Additionally, HQ USAF/XO will coordinateMission Essential Task Listings and measures to meet SERE Specialist validated requirements andupdate the SERE Specialist Career Field Education and Training Plan.4.2. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs, will organize, train and equip aircrew and other identified per-sonnel for SERE operations, normalized at both the initial formal training and operational unit levels.Additionally, SERE Specialists will be trained and equipped a s required to meet wor ldwide deploy-ment taskings and meet qualifications IAW AFI 16-1301, USAF SERE Program.5. Gaining (supported) commands/units will direct by contingency plan or tasking message, the UnitType Code (UTC) requirements for deploying SERE Specialists.6. This policy applies to all military and civilian Air Force personnel and members of the Air ForceReserve and Air National Guard involved in PR/SERE activities and planning. SERE Specialists are notcurrently integrated into the unit manning positions of the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard.Specific management of the SERE program and associated activities will be addressed in the SERE AFI16-1301.7.
