Nuclear Certification Policy. 1.1.1.  It is  Air  Force policy that  procedures, personnel,  equipment,  software, facilities, and organizations that handle, maintain, or operate nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon systems shall  be  nuclear  certified  before  operations  with  war  reserve  materiel  can  be  undertaken. When  used  with  US  nuclear  weapons,  allied-operated  nuclear  weapon  systems,  equipment, and  procedures  must  satisfy  the  same  nuclear  certification  criteria  required  for  Air  Force systems, equipment, and procedures. 1.2.  Applicability. 1.2.1.  This  instruction  applies  to  military  and  civilian  personnel  at  all  levels,  including  Air Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard  units,  involved  in  research,  design,  development, testing,  acquisition,  operation,  maintenance,  and  modification  of  nuclear  weapons  and  their related  systems  and  subsystems.  As  appropriate,  applicable  provisions  of  this  instruction should be included in contracts with private companies providing such support services to the Air Force.

Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the OPR using the Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate chain of command. Ensure  that  all  records  created  as  a  result  of  processes  prescribed  in  this  publication  are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force RDS located in the AFRIMS. The use of the name or mark of any  specific  manufacturer,  commercial  product,  commodity,  or  service  in  this  publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force. 1.3.  Nuclear Certification. 1.3.1.  The  Air  Force  Nuclear  Certification  Program  ensures  all  procedures,  equipment, software,  facilities,  personnel,  and  organizations  are  certified  before  conducting  nuclear operations  with  nuclear  weapons  or  nuclear  weapon  systems.  Nuclear  certification  occurs when  a  determination  is  made  by  the  Air  Force  that  procedures,  equipment,  software,  and facilities are sufficient to perform nuclear weapon functions and personnel and organizations are capable of performing assigned nuclear missions. Nuclear certification is required before a nuclear weapon system or item of equipment  can be used to support unit nuclear mission operations. Note:  Essential Facility Systems (EFS) of individual buildings/structures that are used to maintain, store, or handle nuclear weapons are included as part of the certification of continental United States (CONUS)-based facilities.  Such individual buildings or structures AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 5 include:  lightning/side  flash  protection  systems;  facility  power  systems;  hoists,  cranes,  and similar  devices  (structural  support);  physical  facility  security  systems  and  software,  blast containment/isolation  features;  and  electromagnetic  radiation  and  radiation  monitoring. Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch facilities (LF)/launch control centers (LCC) are  not  considered  facilities  nor  EFS  and  are  part  of  the  overall  ICBM  weapon  system certification. 1.3.2.  Nuclear Certified Item (NCI) is defined as procedures, equipment, software, facilities, systems, subsystems, or components that are nuclear certified in accordance with (IAW) the nuclear certification process outlined in this AFI. Therefore, NCI consists of anything that is nuclear certified. Only nuclear certified items may be used in nuclear operations. The Master Nuclear  Certification  List  (MNCL)  is  the  official  AF  listing  of  all  NCI  (excluding procedures) and can be located at https://www.mil.nwc.kirtland.af.mil/mncl/index.cfm. 1.3.3.  Nuclear Certified  Equipment  (NCE) is defined as peculiar (i.e., system specific) and common  specialized  or  non-specialized  support  equipment  whose  design  meets  applicable design criteria and is nuclear certified IAW the nuclear certification process outlined in this AFI and identified on the MNCL. 1.3.3.1.  NCE  is  a  subset  of  NCI  that  consists  of  support  equipment  that  is  nuclear certified.  NCE  includes  vehicles;  aerospace  ground  equipment;  munitions  materiel handling equipment; facility lifting and suspension equipment; test equipment; automatic test equipment (when used in a support function); organizational, field, and depot support equipment; and related computer program software. 1.3.3.2.  NCE  does  not  include  aircraft  components  and  suspension  equipment  (e.g., pylons, rotary launchers, bomb racks) nor does it include ICBM system components and items installed in the LF/LCC. These items are referred to as “NCI which are not NCE.” 1.4.  Overview of the Air Force Nuclear Certification Program. 1.4.1.  As  illustrated  in  Figure  1.1.,  the  Air  Force  Nuclear  Certification  Program  has  two major  elements:  Design  Certification  and  Operational  Certification.  Design  Certification consists of four distinct components representing nuclear surety-related tasks (Compatibility Certification,  Nuclear  Safety  Design  Certification  (NSDC),  Weapon  System  Safety  Rules (WSSR)  Development/Approval,  and  Technical  Order  Certification).  Operational Certification  consists  of  four  interrelated  personnel/organizational-oriented  nuclear  surety components (Task Qualification Training, Personnel Reliability Assurance Program (PRAP) Certification,  Nuclear  Surety  Training,  and  successful  completion  of  an  Initial  Nuclear Surety Inspection [INSI]). Together, these two elements and their associated components are satisfied before an item can be nuclear certified. Design Certification components identified in  the  Certification  Requirements  Plan  (CRP)  are  accomplished  before  the  Operational Certification  element  can  be  completed  (i.e.,  the  weapon  system  or  item  is  design  certified before the lead/using command can conduct an INSI). Note: Not all certification components may be required for nuclear certification. Specific certification requirements  are outlined in the CRP. 6 AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 Figure 1.1.  Nuclear Certification Major Elements and Components.  1.4.2.  The  Program  Manager  (PM),  as  defined  in  AFI  63-101/20-101,  is  responsible  for obtaining  and  maintaining  design  certification  for  nuclear  weapon  capable  systems  IAW requirements identified in this AFI. The lead/using command is responsible for obtaining and maintaining a unit’s operational certification IAW this AFI. 1.4.3.  Design  Certification  occurs  when  each  of  the  four  components  (Compatibility, Nuclear  Safety  Design,  Weapon  System  Safety  Rules,  and  Technical  Order),  illustrated  in Figure 1.2., are accomplished for the weapon system or item of equipment. Figure 1.2.  Design Certification Components.  1.4.3.1.  The  Air  Force  Nuclear  Weapons  Center,  Surety  and  Certification  Division (AFNWC/NTS)  provides  compatibility  certification  for  aircraft;  air-launched  missile systems;  support  equipment;  and  nuclear  maintenance,  handling,  and  storage  facilities. The  Air  Force  Nuclear  Weapons  Center,  ICBM  Systems  Directorate  (AFNWC/NI) provides  compatibility  certification  for  ICBM  systems.  Reference  MIL-STD-1822B, Nuclear  Compatibility  Certification  of  Nuclear  Weapon  Systems,  Subsystems,  and Support Equipment. 1.4.3.2.  Headquarters  Air  Force  Safety  Center,  Weapons  Safety  Division  (HQ AFSEC/SEW) provides NSDC.

The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(ATL)) approves them, and HQ AFSEC/SEW publishes them in the form of an AFI. Reference AFI  91-102,  Nuclear  Weapon  System  Safety  Studies,  Operational  Safety  Reviews,  and Safety Rules. 1.4.3.4.  The Technical Order Management Agent/Technical Order Management Agency (TOMA) approves and publishes technical orders (TO). Reference TO 00-5-3, Air Force Technical Order Life Cycle Management. 1.4.4.  Operational  Certification  occurs,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  1.3.,  when  the  lead/using command qualifies a unit’s personnel to perform the mission through qualification training, certifies them in the PRAP, trains them in nuclear surety, and assigns a “Ready” rating on an INSI.  Each  unit  is  operationally  certified  by  the  lead/using  command  to  be  considered nuclear-mission  capable.  However,  nuclear  certification  of  a  nuclear  weapon  system  is granted based on the operational certification of the first unit. Subsequent units receiving the new  or  modified  system/item  undergo  an  INSI  conducted  by  the  using  command  prior  to being considered nuclear capable.

To verify nuclear certification status, consult the MNCL located at https://wwwmil.nwc.kirtland.af.mil/mncl/index.cfm. 2.5.7.1.  Ensure  units  with  an  assigned  nuclear  mission  develop  procedures  to  review MNCL changes to determine impact on unit operations. The frequency of this review is established  by  the  Command  based  on  the  unit’s  mission  requirements  but  shall  at  a minimum be conducted monthly. 2.5.8.  Establish the Command’s NCE Management Program. 2.5.8.1.  Appoint a Command NCE Program Manager to act as the single point of contact for the Command program and to establish policies and procedures for the management of  NCE  used  by  nuclear  and  non-nuclear  tasked  operational  units.  These  policies  and procedures: 2.5.8.1.1.  Direct  commanders  of  wings,  groups,  squadrons,  or  geographically separated  units  (applies  to  both  nuclear  and  non-nuclear  tasked  units)  that  operate, maintain,  acquire,  sustain,  or  modify  NCE  to  appoint  NCE  monitors  at  appropriate levels within the unit to manage the unit NCE management program. 2.5.8.1.2.  Require 100% of a unit’s assigned NCE (applies to both nuclear and non-nuclear  tasked  units)  be  surveyed  to  validate  and  document  on  an  annual  basis  to ensure  legibility  of  identification  information  (i.e.,  data  plate,  information  plate, 14 AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 appropriate markings, etc.) and that the information matches the MNCL listing (this may be incorporated into periodic inspections). 2.5.8.1.2.1.  NCE deployed and possessed by expeditionary forces is exempt from the NCE management program. Note:  Inspect NCE returned from deployed locations or depot maintenance to determine serviceability and ensure any unauthorized modifications have been corrected or approved prior to utilization in nuclear operations.  Note:  Dull Sword reporting requirements from AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports, apply for deficiencies associated with NCE. 2.5.8.1.2.2.  For  assets  in  War  Reserve  Materiel  (WRM)/extended  storage  or otherwise  inspected  at  intervals  exceeding  12  months,  perform  this  survey  in conjunction  with  specific  periodic  inspections  for  this  type  of  equipment  IAW appropriate technical data. 2.5.8.1.2.3.  Tie-down  chains,  adjusters,  straps,  load  binders,  shackles,  etc.,  used for  weapon  restraint  during  transportation  as  well  as  individual  bomb  roller assemblies are considered nuclear certified IAW AFI 91-103 but exempt from the NCE management program. 2.5.8.1.2.4.  NCE in depot maintenance at a depot facility or owned and operated by  the  program  office  (i.e.,  not  used  by  an  operational  unit)  is  exempt  from  the NCE management program. 2.5.8.1.2.5.  NCE  in  the  possession  of  the  program  office,  depot  or  product support/distribution function, which is not used by those functions as an end user, is exempt from the NCE management program. 2.5.8.1.2.6.  General  Services  Administration  (GSA)  leased  vehicles  are  exempt from the NCE management program. 2.5.9.  AFGSC  will  appoint/designate  the  Air  Force  Program  Manager  for  CONUS  nuclear maintenance,  handling,  and  storage  facilities  (does  not  include  ICBM  LFs/LCCs).  The  PM will: 2.5.9.1.  Establish, implement, and execute a nuclear certification program to accomplish the  requirements  specified  herein  (to  include  PM  responsibilities  detailed  in  paragraphs 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.4, 2.4.5, 2.4.6, and 2.4.9.) to provide and maintain nuclear certification of these facilities. 2.5.9.2.

Coordinate  the  development  of  all  nuclear  certification  requirements  with  applicable organizations,  (e.g.  contractors,  AFNWC,  HQ  AFSEC,  test  agencies,  National  Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), lead/using command, NATO and higher headquarters). 2.6.4.  Monitor the weapon system nuclear certification process  to  maintain  weapon system configuration and certification. 16 AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 Chapter 3 NUCLEAR CERTIFICATION PROCESS 3.1.  Process  Overview.  Weapon systems  or equipment  items  that require nuclear certification enter  and  remain  in  one  of  four  phases  comprising  the  Air  Force  nuclear  certification  process until  decertified  or  retired  (Figure  3.1.).  Additional  details  related  to  the  activities  during  the major 63-126, https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/nmc2/AFMC/AFNWC/NCSC/default.aspx,  and  available  through AFNWC/NTSC. in  NWC  HDBK components of each phase are provided 3.1.1.  The Identification Phase begins when the PM and/or lead/using command identifies a requirement for equipment, facilities, or weapon system to be nuclear certified and begins the nuclear certification process by submitting an NCIS. 3.1.2.  The Execution Phase begins when the CRP is approved and signed. 3.1.3.  The  Fielding  Phase  begins  with  the  release  of  hardware,  software,  or  procedures following the issuance of either a DCS or NCS from AFNWC to the PM for the use in, or in support of, a nuclear weapon system or its subsystems. 3.1.4.  The  Sustainment  Phase  begins  when  the  fielding  process  is  complete  (typically  with the  user  employing  the  new,  nuclear  certified  weapon  system  or  item  of  equipment configuration to meet nuclear-mission taskings) and includes all the actions that maintain the nuclear certification status of a weapon system. Figure 3.1.  Nuclear Certification Process Phases.  3.2.  Identification Phase.  The Identification Phase encompasses: (1) identifying when a new or modified  weapon  system,  component,  nuclear  mission  support  product,  or  nuclear maintenance/storage  facility  requires  nuclear  certification  and  determining  how  a  modification could affect the nuclear certification of an existing weapon system, component, nuclear mission support product, or nuclear maintenance/storage facility; (2) formally notifying AFNWC/NTSC of a potential impact to the nuclear certification of a weapon system, component, nuclear mission support product, or nuclear maintenance/storage facility via the NCIS; (3) defining the top-level AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 17 certification requirements in the BCRP; and (4) developing and coordinating the detailed nuclear certification requirements, roles, responsibilities, and schedules in the CRP. 3.2.1.  The  Identification  Phase  begins  with  the  nuclear  weapon  system  requirements identification process. In conjunction with the lead/using command, the PM identifies if the new  system  development/acquisition  or  modification  to  an  existing  weapon  system/item  of support equipment requires nuclear certification or impacts the nuclear certification status of the existing system/item. Systems or items requiring nuclear certification should have these requirements documented  as  early  as possible in  the requirements  generation or acquisition process.  For  new  capabilities,  document  nuclear  certification  requirements  in  the  CDD. Lead/using commands identify any operational change that impacts nuclear certified weapon systems (e.g., new Prime Nuclear Airlift Force certified unit, new unit with nuclear mission, new  or  modifications  to  nuclear  maintenance  or  storage  facilities).  New  or  revised  nuclear weapon  maintenance  or  test  procedures  to  be  conducted  in  Air  Force  facilities  are documented and approved IAW AFI 91-103. 3.2.1.1.  The first step in the Identification Phase is to identify the requirement for a new item or an item that requires modification. 3.2.1.2.  The  second  step  is  to  determine  if  the  item  or  modification  requires  nuclear certification  or  changes  the  status  of  a  previously  certified  item  (See  AFI  91-103  for guidance in determining what is required to be nuclear certified). 3.2.1.3.  The third step is to determine exactly what is needed to achieve or maintain the nuclear certification of the weapon system or item. 3.2.2.  Nuclear  Certification  Impact  Statement  (NCIS).  Once  the  PM  identifies  the  need  to obtain  nuclear  certification  for  a  new  system/item  or  identifies  a  potential  impact  to  the nuclear certification of a nuclear certified weapon system/item, it is documented in the NCIS. The NCIS is prepared by the program office, coordinated by the NCM, approved by the PM, and  routed  to  AFNWC/NTSC  through  the  program  office’s  NCM.  The  NCIS  provides information used to determine what initial certification requirements have to be met. 3.2.2.1.  The  NCIS  provides  a  functional  description  of  the  proposed  new  system  or modification  and  includes  the  PM’s  evaluation  of  its  potential  for  nuclear  certification impact.  Since  the  NCIS  serves  as  the  source  document  for  determining  the  impact  the program effort has on nuclear certification, it is important that the NCIS address the new acquisition  or  modification  effort  in  enough  detail  to  allow  the  process  owners  to effectively evaluate and substantiate the recommended certification approach. The NCIS should  identify  potential  impacts  to  compatibility  certification  (reference  MIL-STD-1822B), published TOs, published WSSRs, and nuclear safety design criteria (established in  AFI  91-107,  Design,  Evaluation,  Troubleshooting,  and  Maintenance  Criteria  for Nuclear  Weapon  Systems,  AFMAN  91-118,  Safety,  Design  and  Evaluation  Criteria  for Nuclear  Weapon  Systems,  AFMAN  91-119,  Safety  Design  and  Evaluation  Criteria  for Nuclear  Weapon  Systems  Software).  Additionally,  the  NCIS  should  address  potential operational  certification  impacts  (i.e.,  task  qualification  training,  initial  nuclear  surety inspection, nuclear surety training, or PRAP). 3.2.2.2.  AFNWC/NTSC coordinates the NCIS with the appropriate  nuclear certification process owners (e.g., HQ AFSEC, AFNWC/NTS, lead/using command).  Process owners 18 AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 evaluate the NCIS and identify their requirements that the program  office must meet  in order for the system/item to be nuclear certified.  If it is determined that no certification actions are needed, AFNWC/NTSC notifies the PM via an NCIS No Impact Notification Letter.    This  letter  may  identify  any  administrative  requirements  that  need  to  be accomplished  (e.g.,  updating  the  MNCL  or  NCCS)  and  that  no  further  certification process actions are required. If the process owners determine that certification actions are required, AFNWC/NTSC will notify the PM and develop the BCRP. 3.2.3.  When nuclear certification is needed, AFNWC/NTSC prepares a BCRP for review by all appropriate process owners.  The BCRP identifies to the PM what certification tasks need to  be  accomplished  in  order  to  achieve  nuclear  certification.  The  BCRP  also  identifies  the documentation  needed  to  support  the  certification  evaluations  (e.g.,  Nuclear  Surety Evaluation  [NSE],  Nuclear  Safety  Analysis  Report  [NSAR],  Final  Design  Approval  Report [FDAR],  Electrical  Interface  Control  Drawing  [EICD],  Mechanical  Interface  Control Drawing [MICD], and FCCD). 3.2.3.1.  AFNWC/NTSC provides the BCRP to all the process owners to ensure the plan accurately captures process owner requirements. The BCRP is then forwarded to the PM. The PM develops the CRP with guidance and support from the process owners as needed. 3.2.4.  The CRP defines the requirements, assigns the roles and responsibilities, and defines all of the activities and tasks required to achieve nuclear certification. Each CRP is tailored to meet  the  needs  of  the  particular  acquisition/modification  effort.  As  program  changes  are encountered  and  incorporated  into  the  acquisition/modification  effort,  their  impact  on  the nuclear certification process is reviewed and the CRP updated accordingly 3.2.4.1.  The PM-prepared CRP contains the details regarding how and when the program office  will  meet  the  certification  requirements  identified  in  the  BCRP.  The  CRP  is forwarded to AFNWC/NTSC for coordination and signature from all appropriate process owners. When complete, AFNWC/NTSC approves the CRP and returns it to the PM for implementation. 3.3.  Execution  Phase.  The  Execution  Phase  begins  when  AFNWC  approves  the  CRP  for implementation.  There  are  five  distinct  actions  that  can  take  place  within  the  Execution  Phase: (1)  Compatibility  Certification;  (2)  NSDC;  (3)  WSSR  Development;  (4)  TO  Certification;  and (5)  Operational  Certification.  Activities  during  this  phase  include  the  documentation  of modifications  (to  include  development/update  of  FCCD),  evaluation,  testing,  and  analysis needed to obtain compatibility and safety design certifications; USD(ATL) approval of proposed WSSRs;  verification  of  TOs;  and  the  operational  certification  of  the  weapon  system.  AFNWC issues an NCS when all actions required by the CRP are accomplished.  Issuance of the NCS also initiates an update to the MNCL and completes the Execution Phase. 3.3.1.  Compatibility Certification. Compatibility Certification ensures the equipment item or weapon  system  meets  design  and  evaluation  requirements  for  the  physical,  functional,  and environmental  interface  between  the  delivery  vehicle  or  equipment  item  and  the  nuclear weapon. A successful nuclear weapon system compatibility evaluation is needed to complete the nuclear compatibility process. 3.3.1.1.  Aircraft  Compatibility  Certification.  For  aircraft  and  air-launched  missile systems, nuclear compatibility certification is accomplished by AFNWC/NTS. To obtain AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 19 compatibility  certification,  the  PM  generates  the  compatibility  certification  documents specified in the CRP. Any requirements for testing and analysis needed to complete the compatibility  certification  actions  are  also  identified  in  the  CRP.  AFNWC/NTS coordinates  the  required  tests  and  analysis  with  the  appropriate  program  office,  test organizations (e.g., 49th Test Squadron and Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office [AFSEO]), and  NNSA,  as  needed.  In  addition,  AFNWC/NTS  ensures  NNSA  is  aware  of  system modifications or acquisitions that may affect Nuclear Weapon Major Assembly Release (MAR),  the  Aircraft  Compatibility  Control  Drawings  (ACCD)  for  gravity  weapons,  or the Compatibility Certification (CC) Drawing for cruise missiles via the  weapon  and/or weapon system Project Officer Group (POG) as appropriate. Once all required tests and analyses  have  been  completed,  the  PM  is  required  to  update  the  compatibility certification  documents  as  indicated  by  test  results  and  analyses.  Flight  clearance recommendations  and  SEEK  EAGLE  Certification  is  accomplished  IAW  AFI  63-104, The  SEEK  EAGLE  Program. AFNWC/NTS interfaces and coordinates with  the NNSA, via Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), to obtain the initial release of, or updates to, the MAR  and ACCD as appropriate.  Upon completion of all actions identified in  the CRP for  compatibility  certification,  AFNWC/NTS  issues  an  initial  or  updated  NCCS.    The NCCS  defines  the  nuclear  compatibility  certified  configuration  of  the  nuclear  aircraft system. The content of an NCCS is described in MIL-STD-1822B. 3.3.1.2.  AMAC  Testing.  AFNWC/NTS  and  NNSA  (via  SNL)  determines  if  AMAC testing  is  necessary  for  a  given  certification  effort.    AFNWC/NTS  conducts/directs testing as needed.  The purpose of the testing is to ascertain compliance and functionality of the aircraft AMAC system with the required AMAC specification and to establish that the  aircraft  is  electrically  compatible  with  the  required  set  of  nuclear  weapons.  These results  are  published  in  a  test  report  following  each  test  and  shall  be  used  by AFNWC/NTSA as source data to issue nuclear compatibility certification. ICBM 3.3.1.3.  ICBM  Compatibility  Certification.  For systems,  compatibility certification is accomplished by AFNWC/NI in conjunction with the lead/using command coordination. AFNWC interfaces and coordinates with NNSA to obtain the initial release of, or updates to,  the MAR.  The CRP identifies design and evaluation requirements  as well  as  any  special  testing  or  analysis  necessary  to  obtain  compatibility  certification. Upon  completion  of  all  actions  identified  in  the  CRP  for  compatibility  certification, AFNWC/NI  will  notify  AFNWC/NTSC  via  a  Compatibility  Certification  Letter  and forward  a  copy  to  AFNWC/NTS.    The  Compatibility  Certification  Letter  and  the  MAR serves as the NCCS. 3.3.1.4.  Facility  Compatibility  Certification.  Facility  compatibility  certification  ensures nuclear  maintenance,  handling,  and  storage  facilities  and  their  associated  systems  are compatible with the nuclear weapon activities performed within the facility with respect to the interface between the weapons and the facility environments as measured against the  weapon  stockpile-to-target  sequence  (STS)  document  criteria.  Changes  in  facility usage (e.g., the introduction of new weapons for which the facility/unit is not certified to store or maintain or the introduction of new or revised nuclear weapon maintenance/test procedures)  or  modifications  to  the  facility  drive  the  need  to  evaluate  impacts  on  the compatibility  certification  of  the  facility.  The  CRP  identifies  the  compatibility 20 AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 certification  requirements.  Upon  completion  of  all  actions  identified  in  the  CRP  for compatibility certification, AFNWC/NTS will issue a Compatibility Certification Letter. 3.3.2.  Nuclear Safety Design Certification (NSDC). This  component of design  certification evaluates  facilities,  hardware,  and/or  software  associated  with  nuclear  weapon  systems  for compliance  with  NSDC  and  evaluation  criteria.  The  purpose  is  to  validate  that  the  system; item of equipment; or nuclear maintenance, handling, and storage facility can be used safely in  support  of  nuclear  mission  operations.  NSDC  begins  with  an  approved  CRP  that  has identified  the  need  to  nuclear  safety  design  certify  a  system/item  that  is  used  with  nuclear weapons. The CRP also outlines the applicable design and evaluation criteria in AFI 91-103, AFI 91-107, AFMAN 91-118, and AFMAN 91-119 that are satisfied for the issuance of the NSDC.  A  successful  nuclear  safety  design  evaluation  and  subsequent  issuance  of  a  NSDC Letter by HQ AFSEC/SEW to AFNWC/NTSC are needed to complete the NSDC. 3.3.2.1.  The  PM  must  comply  with  requirements  identified  in  the  approved  CRP  and document these actions IAW AFI 91-103. Compliance is documented in an NSE, which is submitted to HQ AFSEC/SEW with a copy to AFNWC/NTS by the program office. 3.3.2.2.  The decision to grant NSDC is based on compliance with design criteria and an adequate  exercise  of  the  design  as  specified  by  the  evaluation  criteria  outlined  in  the CRP. Discrepancies and/or deviations from design and evaluation criteria are assessed for risk (based on a qualitative or quantitative assessment of likelihood and consequence) and impact  to  operational  requirements.  If  discrepancies  or  deviations  exist,  the  PM's  NSE should  identify  each  risk,  its  risk  assessment  in  accordance  with  MIL-STD-882E,  the PM's  decisions  on  implementation  of  mitigations,  and  formal  risk  acceptance  by  the specified management  authority as  required in  AFI 63-101/20-101. Restrictions cited in the NSDC letter are listed in the MNCL under the item.  The PM ensures the appropriate TOMA  implements  restrictions  in  technical  data,  including  Technical  Orders,  Joint Nuclear Weapons Publication System (JNWPS) Manuals. 3.3.3.  Weapon  System  Safety  Rules  Development.  The  development  of  a  new  nuclear capable  weapon  system  or  a  significant  design  or  mission  change  (to  include  a  CONOPS change)  to  an  existing  weapon  system  may  dictate  the  need  for  a  NWSSG  study  to  be included in the CRP. The NWSSG study leads to the development, USD(ATL) approval, and promulgation of weapon system specific WSSRs (published in 91-series AFIs). WSSRs are operational  restrictions/requirements  designed  to  assure  nuclear  weapon  systems  are compliant  with  the  four  DOD  nuclear  surety  standards  as  defined  by  DODD  3150.02. WSSRs must be approved by the USD(ATL) prior to the operational use of nuclear weapon systems  with  war reserve materiel.  The requirement to  convene the NWSSG and conduct  a safety  study  as  described  in  AFI  91-102  is  documented  in  the  approved  CRP.  The  CRP identifies  a  Rules  Need  Date.  This  date  is  used  as  the  baseline  for  developing  the  NWSSG schedule,  which  includes  delivery  dates  for  all  required  documents  (e.g.,  Lead/Using Command  Operational  Plan  Data  Document  [OPDD],  NSAR,  and  TNSA)  and  other materials  needed  by  the  NWSSG  to  support  the  scheduled  studies.  USD(ATL)  approval  of new  or  updated  WSSRs,  and  subsequent  issuance  of  a  Safety  Rules  Approval  Letter  to AFNWC/NTSC  by  HQ  AFSEC/SEW  completes  the  WSSR  development  activities.  For nuclear  certified  systems  with  USD(ATL)  approved  WSSRs  in  place,  if  the  NWSSG determines  that  the  existing  WSSRs  are  adequate,  HQ  AFSEC/SEW  forwards  the  Safety Rules Approval Letter to AFNWC/NTSC. AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 21 3.3.4.  Technical  Order  Certification.  The  PM  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  TOMA develops/updates  TOs  and  procedures  involved  in  a  weapon  system’s  nuclear  mission operations,  maintenance,  troubleshooting,  OPCERT,  DECERT,  handling,  movement, restraint configuration, loading, unloading, delivery, and testing to be complete, accurate, and safe as directed by TO 00-5-3. Procedures that comply with WSSRs, requirements in the AFI 91-series,  nuclear  safety,  nuclear  compatibility,  and  design  safety  features  is  the responsibility of the TCM. The CRP describes all TO-related actions required to certify the procedures.  When the  TOMA  will  formally  notify AFNWC/NTSC via a Technical Order Approval Notification Letter. technical  data is  approved, 3.3.5.  Operational  Certification.  Operational  Certification  ensures  that  the  organization  and personnel  assigned  to  support  the  nuclear  mission  can  effectively  and  safely  operate  and maintain  their  assigned  weapon  systems  (see  AFI  13-503,  Nuclear  Capable  Unit Certification, Decertification and Restriction Program). Operational Certification applies to a  variety  of  circumstances:  e.g.  a  new  weapon  system  that  has  a  nuclear  capability,  an existing weapon system that has had the nuclear mission capability added to the unit’s DOC statement, or an existing nuclear capable unit that has received a significant modification to a nuclear  certified  weapon  system,  subsystem,  or  item  of  support  equipment.  The  CRP describes the actions required to  achieve operational  certification. The lead/using command sends  an  Operational  Certification  Letter  to  AFNWC/NTSC  to  confirm  operational certification actions are complete. 3.3.5.1.  Lead/Using  Command.  The  lead/using  command  has  the  final  authority, responsibility, and accountability to determine the requirements of this certification. The lead/using  command  develops  and  implements  a  tailored  nuclear  qualification  program for  each  type  of  weapon  system  accomplishing  this  certification.  The  program  includes nuclear-mission  qualification  training,  training  programs  to  ensure  compliance  and proficiency in  all applicable NSI events  as listed and described in  CJCSI  3263.05B and AFI  90-201  and  aircrew/missile  crew  nuclear  mission  certifications  as  applicable  to  the unit’s  DOC  statement.  The  CRP  describes  the  actions  required  to  achieve  operational certification. 3.3.5.2.  Personnel Reliability and Assurance Program (PRAP) is conducted IAW DODM 5210.42_AFMAN 13-501, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program. 3.3.5.3.  Required nuclear surety training is conducted IAW AFI 91-101. 3.3.5.4.  Applicable nuclear qualification training and task evaluations are accomplished and personnel are graded and qualified IAW applicable operations and maintenance TOs, AFIs, and the lead/using command’s supplements and instructions. 3.3.5.5.

The in coordination  with  HQ  AFSEC,  determines  the  need  for  an  INSI  IAW  AFI  90-201  and ensures this requirement is included in the CRP. lead/using  command, 3.3.6.  Execution  Phase  Completion.  Throughout  the  Execution  Phase,  AFNWC/NTSC monitors  the  status  of  the  nuclear  certification  process.  The  CRP  identifies  which  of  the nuclear  certification  process  components  (i.e.,  Compatibility  Certification,  NSDC,  WSSR Development/Approval,  TO  Certification  and  Operational  Certification)  are  required  for nuclear  certification.  Successful  completion  of  these  tasks  is  documented  by  the  following: 22 AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 (1)  For  aircraft  systems,  an  NCCS;  for  ICBM  systems  (the  MAR  and  Compatibility Certification  Letter  serves  as  the  NCCS);  for  facilities  and  support  equipment,  a Compatibility Certification Letter, as appropriate, indicating that all actions for Compatibility Certification  are  complete;  (2)  The  NSDC  Letter;    (3)  Formal  TO  approval  letter  from  the appropriate  TOMA;  (4)  Weapon  System  Safety  Rules  Approval  notification;  and  (5)  An Operational  Certification  Letter  from  the  lead/using  command,  indicating  completion  of Operational  Certification  requirements  for  the  first  operationally  certified  unit.  When  all  of the  CRP-directed  Design  Certification  components  identified  above  are  accomplished, AFNWC/NTSC  develops  the  DCS  Letter,  if  necessary,  for  AFNWC/CC  signature.    Once signed,  the  DCS  is  forwarded  to  the  PM  and  the  MNCL  is  updated  to  indicate  that  Design Certification is complete. Once all of the CRP-directed actions are completed, an NCS Letter is issued to the PM, and the MNCL is updated to indicate the system/item is nuclear certified. These actions complete the Execution Phase. 3.4.  Fielding  Phase.  The Fielding Phase typically begins with the issuance of either a DCS or NCS from AFNWC to the PM Note: Nuclear Certification = Design Certification + Operational Certification  of  one  unit.  The  Fielding  Phase  typically  ends  with  the  user  employing  the  new, nuclear  certified  weapon  system  or  item  of  equipment  configuration  to  meet  nuclear  mission operations. This phase also addresses situations that require the release of a new or modified item to  the  user  prior  to  design  certification  or  weapon  system  nuclear  certification  being  complete (e.g.,  conventional-only  release  or  release  for  operational-certification  actions  [i.e.,  for  training purposes only]). 3.4.1.  Release Process. “Release” refers to the process of sending a new or modified item to the user. All items affecting a nuclear certified weapon system configuration are released via a TO/TCTO, and units process them IAW AFI 21 series guidance.  Items are released in one of three conditions: 3.4.1.1.  Items that modify an existing nuclear certified weapon system configuration. 3.4.1.2.  Items  that  add  nuclear  capability  to  an  existing  non-nuclear  certified  weapon system. 3.4.1.3.  An entirely new nuclear certified weapon system. 3.4.2.  The  lead/using  command  authorizes  the  PM  to  release  the  item  along  with  any necessary  restrictions.  The  need  to  include  restrictions  may  come  from  many  sources including operational test results, other limitations identified during LCSE certifications, and circumstances as directed by lead/using command requirements. 3.4.3.  Non-nuclear mission requirements may drive the need to field items destined for use on nuclear certified systems before an item has been appropriately certified. 3.4.4.  When  the  PM’s  recommendation  for  release  and  the  lead/using  command’s  release authorization  actions  are  complete,  the  PM  notifies  the  AFNWC/NTSC  that  all  program office/lead/using command-related CRP activities are completed. This notification completes the Fielding Phase. 3.5.  Sustainment Phase.  A nuclear certified system or item enters the Sustainment Phase once the  system  is  fielded  and  remains  in  the  Sustainment  Phase  until  it  is  decertified,  retired,  or modified. The purpose of the Sustainment Phase is to monitor the nuclear certified system/item AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 23 for  any  changes  that  would  impact  the  design  or  operational  certification  of  the  system/item. During  this  phase,  monitoring  activities  include  weapon  system/safety  deficiency  reporting, reporting the results of periodic system  testing, inspections/evaluations,  and periodic  procedure reviews.  Any  change  that  alters  the  certification  status  would  drive  the  process  to  reenter  the Identification Phase. 3.5.1.  Compatibility  Certification.  During  the  Sustainment  Phase  a  certified  item  is monitored  to  confirm  that  it  continues  to  meet  the  requirements  for  the  interface  (physical, functional  and  environmental)  between  the  item  and  the  nuclear  weapon  based  upon established design and evaluation requirements. 3.5.2.  Nuclear Safety Design Certification (NSDC). Process owners monitor fielded nuclear certified systems  (i.e., hardware, software, facilities, etc.) for changes that  could  impact  the nuclear  safety  design  certified  status  of  the  system/item  IAW  AFI  91-103.  Monitoring  is accomplished through the use of nuclear surety inspection reports, DULL SWORD reports, and  other  safety-related  reporting,  as  well  as  deficiency  reports  IAW  AFI  91-204,  Safety Investigations and Reports, AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports and TO  00-35D-54,  USAF  Deficiency  Reporting,  Investigation  and  Resolution.  These  reports serve  as  the  primary  means  by  which  the  PM  and  other  process  owners  identify  trends  or areas of concern affecting the nuclear safety design certification of the system/item. The need to  modify  the  weapon  system/item  or  equipment/facility  results  in  reentry  into  the Identification Phase. 3.5.3.  Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSR). Fielded nuclear certified weapons systems are monitored  by  the  NWSSG  on  a  recurring  basis  through  OSRs  and  through  special  safety studies  conducted  by  the  NWSSG  to  address  specific  issues  when  needed.  During  these reviews/studies,  the  NWSSG  assesses  compliance  of  all  aspects  of  the  nuclear  weapons system  with  the  four  DOD  nuclear  weapon  system  surety  standards  as  required  by  DODM 3150.02. Existing WSSRs are reviewed and modified as necessary and recommendations are made to mitigate shortfalls in the system with respect to compliance with the DOD Weapon System Surety Standards across the entire STS. HQ AFSEC/SEW notifies AFNWC/NTSC of changes  to  the  WSSRs.  If  there  is  no  impact,  then  no  action  is  needed.  If  the  new  rules  or recommendations  require  changes  to  the  weapon  system  or  otherwise  impact  the  nuclear certification of the particular weapon system, then the next step is to reenter the Identification Phase. 3.5.4.  Technical Order Sustainment. Sustainment of current TOs is critical to the continued nuclear  certification  of  a  weapon  system.  Personnel  operating  and  maintaining  nuclear certified  weapon  systems  with  approved  and  verified  TOs  must  identify  deficiencies  in procedural  and/or  technical  guidance  to  their  lead/using  command  functional  managers.  Changes  are  processed  IAW  existing  AF  guidance  (ref  TO  00-5-1,  Air  Force  Technical Order System). 3.5.5.  Operational  Certification.  Operational  certification inspection process.  is  maintained through the 24 AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 Chapter 4 MASTER NUCLEAR CERTIFICATION LIST 4.1.  Purpose of the Master Nuclear Certification List (MNCL). 4.1.1.  The MNCL identifies equipment, hardware, software, and facilities that are nuclear or design  certified.  The  MNCL  is  the  sole  authority  for  determining  the  certification  status  of nuclear  certified  weapon  systems,  support  equipment,  software,  and  facilities.  It  is  a  web-based  database  that  provides  users  the  nuclear  certification  status  of  weapon  systems, subsystems,  components,  software,  support  equipment,  and  facilities.  Verification  of certification  status  and  configuration  is  accomplished  by  MAJCOM  policy  IAW  paragraph 2.5.7. of this instruction. 4.1.2.  NATO  Host  Nations  are  authorized  to  use  Engineering  Liaison  Office  (ELO)-4, Master  Nuclear  Certification  List  Extract  for  User  Nation  Use,  for  determining  the certification status of host nation owned support equipment, hardware, and software. ELO-4 is provided by the AFNWC/NDEO. 4.1.3.  The  certification  status  of  a  listed  item  is  indicated  in  the  Certification  Status  (Cert Status) column and contains either the word “Design” or “Nuclear.” 4.1.3.1.  The  “Design”  designation  indicates  the  item  has  been  successfully  design certified but has not yet completed its operational certification requirements and therefore is not authorized for use in support of nuclear operations. 4.1.3.2.  The  “Nuclear”  designation  indicates  that  the  item  has  completed  all  nuclear certification  requirements  identified  in  the  CRP  and  is  authorized  for  use  in  support  of nuclear operations. 4.1.4.  Users of the MNCL should check both the specific item listing as well as the General Guidance  section  of  the  MNCL  to  determine  the  certified  status  and  usability  (i.e., restrictions) of a nuclear certified item. 4.2.  MNCL Management. 4.2.1.  The MNCL is managed by AFNWC/NTSC. 4.2.2.  Routine updates to the MNCL occur on the last duty day of every  month.  However, out-of-cycle updates can occur at any time based on operational necessity. 4.2.3.  The  MNCL  feedback  system  is  the  means  of  communicating  with  AFNWC/NTSC regarding  MNCL  issues,  questions,  changes,  suggestions,  etc.  This  feedback  system  is initiated  via  e-mail  to  mnclproblem@us.af.mil  or  by  using  the  “Problem/Suggestion”  link on the main menu page of the MNCL. 4.3.  Accessing the MNCL. 4.3.1.  A  computer  with  an  Internet  capability  operating  from  a  .mil  or  .gov  domain  is required.  In  addition,  Common  Access  Card  (CAC)/Public  Key  Infrastructure  (PKI) authentication  from  a  government  network  is  required.  Contractor  support  personnel  or organizations  that  support  program  offices  or  other  Air  Force  entities  dealing  with  nuclear AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 25 certified  items  who  do  not  have  a  DISA  CAC  operating  on  a  .mil  or  .gov  domain  cannot access the MNCL. Send requests for MNCL information to mnclproblem@us.af.mil. 4.4.  MNCL Restrictions. 4.4.1.  Items listed in the MNCL having restrictions apply to nuclear operations only. 4.4.2.  An individual nuclear certified item may be restricted from use with nuclear weapons at  any  time  and  for  any  reason  (e.g.,  damage,  modification,  or  changes  to  intended  usage). The  restriction  is  placed  to  preclude  use  of  a  particular  item  with  nuclear  weapons.  Such restrictions are clearly marked in the MNCL listing under the restrictions for that particular item  and  reflect  individual  item  identification  information  (e.g.,  item  serial  number).  Such restrictions  do  not  constitute  removal  of  nuclear  certification  or  system  decertification.  The restricted item must remain accounted for IAW paragraph 2.5.8. 4.5.  Removal of Items from the MNCL. removal  of  obsolete items to 4.5.1.  Request mnclproblem@us.af.mil or by using the “Problem/Suggestion” link on the main menu page of  the  MNCL.  The  MNCL  administrators  coordinate  the  request  through  the  lead/using command(s)  for  concurrence.  Once  concurrence  is  received,  the  item  is  removed  from  the MNCL during the next routine update. the  MNCL  via  e-mail from 4.5.2.  All items that are removed from the MNCL are archived for historical purposes. 26 AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 Chapter 5 TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 5.1.

The CC is maintained by Sandia. 36 AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 Critical Component—A component of a nuclear weapon system that, if bypassed, activated, or tampered with, could result in, or contribute to, deliberate or inadvertent authorizing, prearming, arming, or launch of a combat delivery vehicle carrying a nuclear weapon, or the targeting of a nuclear  weapon  to  other  than  its  planned  target.  HQ  AFSEC/SEW  designates  critical components. (USAF) DECERT—(ICBM  only  term)  Action  by  proper  authority  to  remove  a  certified  critical component  from  operational  use.  When  it  becomes  necessary  to  remove  an  operationally certified  critical  component  from  the  operational  weapon  system,  DECERT  is  accomplished prior to removing two-person control. DECERT consists of removal of classified/code material and the subsequent removal from nuclear certified control. Design  Certification—This  occurs  when  each  of  four  components  is  accomplished  for  the weapon  system:    Compatibility  Certification,  Nuclear  Safety  Design  Certification,  Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSR) Approval, and Technical Orders Approval. Electrical  Interface  Control  Drawing  (EICD)—The EICD documents the physical, electrical power, and logical signal circuits in the delivery system between the avionics components at the DOE/AF  interfaces.  The  EICD  includes  all  types  of  electrical  interfaces  in  the  monitor  and control  circuits  of  the  nuclear  weapon  and  nuclear  weapon  system,  including  man-machine, discrete lines, and multiplex data buses. Facility—One  or  multiple  buildings  used  for  maintenance,  handling,  and  storage  of  nuclear weapons,  the  associated  physical  security  features,  and  supporting  infrastructure  located  within CONUS. (USAF) the Facility  Certification  Configuration  Document configuration  of  facilities  certified  to  have  the  capability  to  conduct  nuclear  operations  with nuclear weapons or nuclear weapon systems. At a minimum the FCCD will contain a functional description of the facility, identification and configuration information for all facilities capable of conducting maintenance and storage of nuclear weapons. Additionally, each facility’s EFS will be described in sufficient detail to explain functional capabilities and configuration information to include any inter-relationships between these systems which affect the capabilities. (FCCD)—The  FCCD  defines Lead  Command—The  MAJCOM  that  serves  as  the  operator’s  interface  with  the  PM  for  a weapon system as defined by AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems or applicable Program Action Directive (PAD). This term is not to be confused with that MAJCOM designated by AF/A5R as OPR for authoring a requirements document (i.e., This  MAJCOM  would  be  the  “Using  Command”).  Although,  in  most  cases,  the  MAJCOM designated  by  AF/A5R  to  sponsor  a  requirement  becomes  the  "Lead  Command"  for  a  weapon system. Major  Assembly  Release  (MAR)—A  Sandia  National  Laboratories  (SNL)  prepared,  NNSA approved  statement  that  war  reserve  (WR)  weapon  material  is  satisfactory  for  release  on  a designated  effective  date  to  the  DOD  for  specified  uses  which  are  qualified  by  exceptions  and limitations.  The  MAR  contains  drawings  and  data  defining  the  physical,  functional  and environmental characteristics of the weapon and the delivery platform. For aircraft systems, the MAR also includes the Aircraft Compatibility Control Drawing (ACCD). Mechanical  Interface  Control  Drawing  (MICD)—the  MICD  defines  the  physical  and mechanical  interfaces  between  the  delivery  platform  and  the  nuclear  weapon.  The  MICD AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 37 includes  dimensions,  clearances,  forces,  installations,  etc.,  associated  with  the  weapon’s suspension and release equipment (for aircraft, on the wing or in the weapons bay). Non-Combat Delivery Vehicle—Any vehicle, other than combat vehicles, used to move nuclear weapons. (USAF) Non-Specialized  Equipment—Equipment  used  with  nuclear  weapons  but  not  specifically designed for that purpose. (USAF) Nuclear  Certification—The  process  for  determining  that  procedures,  personnel,  equipment, software,  facilities,  and  organizations  meet  nuclear  surety  standards  and  are  capable  of performing  assigned  nuclear  weapon  functions  and  missions.  Nuclear  certification  is  necessary prior to a system acquiring operational status. Nuclear Certified Equipment—Peculiar (i.e., system specific) and common specialized or non-specialized  support  equipment  whose  design  meets  applicable  design  criteria  and  is  nuclear certified  IAW the nuclear certification process  outlined in  this publication and identified in  the MNCL. (USAF) Nuclear  Certified  Item—Procedures,  equipment,  software,  facilities,  systems,  subsystems  or components  which  are  nuclear  certified  IAW  the  nuclear  certification  process  outlined  in  this publication. (USAF) Nuclear  Surety  (also  referred  to  as  Nuclear  Weapons  Surety)—Policies,  procedures, controls, and actions that encompass safety, security, and control  measures, which ensure there will  be  no  nuclear  weapon  accidents,  incidents,  unauthorized  detonation,  or  degradation  of weapon effectiveness during its stockpile-to-target sequence. (DOD) Nuclear Weapon—A complete assembly (e.g., implosion type, gun type, or thermonuclear type) in its intended ultimate configuration which, upon completion of the prescribed arming, fusing, and firing sequence, is capable of producing the intended nuclear reaction and release of energy. (DOD) Nuclear Weapon System—A combat delivery vehicle with its nuclear weapon or weapons and associated support equipment, noncombat delivery vehicles, facilities, and services. (USAF) Nuclear  Weapon  System  Surety  Group  (NWSSG)—The  NWSSG is  composed  of representatives  from  AF/A10/A4S  applicable  Air  Force  Major  Commands,  Combatant Commands, Department of Energy, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency and is chaired by an appointee  from  HQ  AFSEC/SEW.  It  conducts  all  nuclear  weapon  system  safety  studies  and operational  safety  reviews  to  evaluate  Air  Force  nuclear  weapon  systems  and  ensure  the  DOD Nuclear  Weapon  Surety  Standards  are  met  in  weapon  system  design  and  operations.  (USAF definition) Operational Certification—This occurs when the lead/using command qualifies its personnel to perform  the  mission,  certifies  them  in  the  Personnel  Reliability  Assurance  Program  (PRAP), trains  them  in  nuclear  surety,  and  assigns  a  “Ready”  rating  on  an  Initial  Nuclear  Surety Inspection (INSI). OPCERT—(ICBM  only  term)  The  process  of  verifying  a  system  or  critical  component  is functioning  as  design  certified  and  all  credible  threats  and  scenarios  are  mitigated.  OPCERT procedures  are  accomplished  on  all  nuclear  critical  components  prior  to  installation  in  the 38 AFI63-125  24 JULY 2017 operational  weapon  system  or  whenever  two-person  control  has  been  lost,  the  component  has been decertified, or when directed by higher authority. Program  Manager  (PM)—The  designated  individual  with  responsibility  for  and  authority  to accomplish program objectives for development, production, and sustainment to meet the user’s operational needs.
