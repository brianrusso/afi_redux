 BY ORDER OF THE  SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 90-1001 9 JANUARY 2017 Special Management PLANNING TOTAL FORCE ASSOCIATIONS (TFAS)     COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY ACCESSIBILITY:   Publications and forms are available on the e-Publishing website at www.e-Publishing.af.mil for downloading or ordering. RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.  OPR:  AF/A8XF  Supersedes:  AFI90-1001, 29 May 2007,  25 April 2008  Certified by: AF/A5/8  (Lt Gen James M. Holmes) Pages: 31 This  instruction  implements  Air  Force  Policy  Memorandum  (AFPM)  90-10,  Total  Force Integration, 27 October 2016 for planning Total Force Associations (TFAs) and the development of Total Force Association Proposals (TFAPs).  It applies to all Air Force components, Regular Air Force (RegAF), the Air Force Reserve (AFR), and the Air National Guard (ANG).  For the purpose of this instruction, the National Guard Bureau (NGB) functions as both a Headquarters Air Force  (HAF) 2-letter and a Major Command (MAJCOM) equivalent.   Refer  recommended changes  and  questions  about  this  publication  to  the  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  (OPR) using  AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication.    This  publication  may  be supplemented at any level, but all supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to  certification and approval.   Requests for waiver to  this instruction will be forwarded  to  AF/A8XF  for  consideration.    Ensure  all  records  created  as  a  result  of  processes prescribed  in  this  publication  are  maintained  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  Air  Force  Manual (AFMAN)  33-363,  Management  of  Records,  and  disposed  of  IAW  the  Air  Force  Records Disposition  Schedule  (RDS)  in  the  Air  Force  Records  Information  Management  System (AFRIMS). SUMMARY OF CHANGES This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.  Major changes include guidance to MAJCOMs and HAF organizations for planning TFAs within the context of the Strategy, Planning, and Programming Process (SP3).  Specifically, it replaces the 1) Initiative Review  Worksheet  (IRW)  and  2)  Integration  Plan  (I-Plan),  with  a  single  Association  Plan  (A- 2 AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 Plan).  This instruction also eliminates the Total Force Enterprise Working Group (TFEWG) and Total Force Enterprise Evaluation Group (TFEEG) and replaces them with a single HAF board, Total Force Evaluation Board (TFEB), that will provide a final HAF review and approval of all TFAPs.  This document removes the requirement for biennial reviews of A-Plans.  Continuing, this instruction defines partnering MAJCOMs, to include the Sponsor-MAJCOM and Associate-MAJCOM(s) and directs the partnering MAJCOMs to coordinate with the HAF functional staffs and Core Function Leads (CFLs) during the development of the Business Case Analysis (BCA) and  A-Plan.    Furthermore,  it  substitutes  “host  units”  and  “associate  units”  with  “Sponsor Organizations” and “Associate Organizations” to  facilitate associations involving both  unit and non-unit  entities,  including  associated  detachments.    This  instruction  reduces  the  context  of TFAs to only two types:  Classic Association (CA) and Active Association (AA).  Finally, this document  does  not  address  operational  or  managerial  issues  concerning  TFAs;  operational  and management issues are the purview of AF/A3, the partnering MAJCOMs, wings, groups, and the Sponsor and Associate Organizations.

Background.  The United States Air Force’s (USAF) Total Force (TF) includes the RegAF, ANG,  AFR,  civilian  and  contractor  workforce,  and  Civil  Air  Patrol  (CAP)  when  conducting missions for the Air Force as the official Air Force Auxiliary; each offers unique capabilities and strengths.  The Air Force utilizes all of its contributing components in varied capacities to meet the Nation’s National Military Objectives.  Associations are one way the Air Force leverages the TF to meet these objectives efficiently and effectively. 1.2.  Scope.  The Air Force Strategic Master Plan (SMP) identifies Agility and Inclusiveness as two  strategic  imperatives  driving  fundamental  change  in  the  nature  of  the  Air  Force.    To maximize utility, the Air Force must find creative ways to optimize the existing force structure to meet  mission  demands  with  constrained  resources  and  to  dominate  our  adversaries  in  an increasingly  dynamic  environment.    TFAs  provide  a  construct  for  the  USAF  to  optimize  the existing  force  structure  aligned  with  the  tenets  of  Agility  and  Inclusiveness  described  in  the SMP.    TFAs  are  formal  agreements  between  two  or  more  USAF  component  organizations  to share resources to perform a common mission. 1.3.  Applicability.  This  publication  applies  to  the  planning  of  all  TFAs.    The  relationship between the CAP and the USAF is carefully defined by federal law (see Title 10, United States Code  (U.S.C.),  Sections  9441-9448);  therefore,  Total  Force  options  involving  the  CAP  are  not governed by this instruction.  AFI 10-2701, Organization and Function of the Civil Air Patrol, details  the  procedures  for  employing  the  CAP  and  the  circumstances  under  which  CAP  may perform Air Force-assigned missions in its role as a volunteer civilian auxiliary of the USAF. 1.4.  Objective.  The  objective  of  this  instruction  is  to  outline  roles  and  responsibilities, definitions, and the planning process for development and assessment of TFAs.  AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 5 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Director, Air National Guard (NGB/CF).  NGB/CF will provide guidance, oversight, and direction on all ANG TFAPs and TFAs under consideration with AF/A8XF. 2.2.  MAJCOM Responsibilities: 2.2.1.  The  TFA  Sponsor-MAJCOM,  in  coordination  with  the  Associate-MAJCOM(s),  will develop  TFAPs  and  all  required  association  documentation  to  establish  new  TFAs, incorporate  significant  changes  to  existing  TFAs,  and  coordinate  disassociation  actions.  Prior  to  submitting  TFAPs  for  TFEB  review;  the  partnering  MAJCOMs  will  coordinate planned TFAPs with the appropriate Core Function Leads (CFLs) and HAF functional staffs.  The  NGB  will  also  coordinate  all  ANG  TFAPs  with  the  respective  State  Adjutant  General (TAG). 2.2.2.  The  Sponsor-MAJCOM  is  responsible  for  timely  coordination  of  funding  for  new construction  and/or  renovations  required  for  TFA  bed  down,  as  well  as  coordinating operation and sustainment  funding of TFA facilities with  the installation host.  Funding for EIAP  shall  be  accomplished  to  ensure  completion  and  inform  the  decision  making  process prior  to  any  commitment  of  resources.    The  Sponsor-MAJCOM  will  advocate  for  funding with  Air  Force  Installation  and  Mission  Support  Center  (AFIMSC)  or  ARC  and  ensure compliance  with  EIAP  prior  to  committing  resources  to  a  course  of  action.    The  Sponsor-MAJCOM,  in  coordination  with  AFIMSC  or  ARC,  shall  program  for  anticipated  out-year EIAP workloads based on input from command proponents.  If proponent offices exceed the budget,  the  proponent  must  provide  the  remaining  funding.    Where  an  Associate Organization requires sole use of space that cannot be provided with existing facilities, it is normally the responsibility of that organization’s MAJCOM (i.e., the Associate-MAJCOM)         to advocate for funding with AFIMSC or ARC for new construction or renovation projects. 2.2.3.  MAJCOMs  have  a  responsibility  to  assess  their  associations  in  accordance  with Chapter  5.    Partnering  MAJCOMs  will  determine  reasonable/practical  scope  and  scale  of         the  units’  participation  in  scheduled  inspections  in  accordance  with  AFI  90-201,  The  Air Force Inspection System. 2.3.  Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center (AFIMSC).  Partnering MAJCOMs will work with AFIMSC or ARC and SAF/IE to ensure proper support costs are aligned to meet TFA program requirements. 2.4.  Core  Function Leads  (CFLs).  CFLs will use their Core Function Support Plans (CFSPs) to  address  Total  Force  initiatives  within  their  specific  Core  Function.    CFSPs  will  include  a general  narrative  of  ARC  contributions  to  their specific  Core  Function  and  a  list  of  MAJCOM (BCA) initiated and HAF Force Mix Analysis (FMA) initiated TFAPs.  CFLs will also identify legal/policy barriers involved in using the ARC.  AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 9 Chapter 3 TFAP PLANNING 3.1.  TFAP Planning Overview.  This chapter outlines the TFAP planning process and explains Decision Support Documents (DSDs), A-Plans and EIAP documentation.  Partnering MAJCOMs will initiate TFAs whether through an endorsed AF/A5/8 force mix analysis process, such as the High Velocity Analysis (HVA), or through the MAJCOM directed Business Case Analysis CA). Partnering MAJCOMs are encouraged to collaborate early with HAF organizations regardless of which method initiates the TFAP planning process. 3.2.  DSD.  The  DSD  for  a  TFAP  will  be  a  force  mix  analysis  (e.g.,  HVA)  accomplished  and approved  for  use  by  AF/A8XF  or  a  BCA  completed  by  the  partnering  MAJCOMs.    A  DSD  is required  for  each  TFAP  as  it  presents  costs,  benefits,  and  risks  of  the  proposal.    This  analysis does not replace the judgment of decision makers, but rather enhances such judgment. 3.2.1.  BCA Development.  If required, the Sponsor-MAJCOM will lead the development of a  BCA,  in  coordination  with  the  Associate-MAJCOM(s).    AFI  65-509,  Business  Case Analysis, and AFMAN 65-510, Business Case Analysis Procedures, provide guidance in the development  of  BCAs.    MAJCOMs  are  highly  encouraged  to  contact  the  Financial Management Center of Expertise (FM CoE) for BCA assistance and continuity.   MAJCOMs will specifically address the following factors in the BCA: 3.2.1.1.  Fully  identify  objectives,  assumptions,  and  Course(s)  of  Action  (COAs).    At  a minimum, the COAs will include the current status quo, a CA and an AA. 3.2.1.2.  Identify  costs  associated  with  each  COA,  such  as  manpower,  flying  hours (initial/  instructor  qualification  and  continuation  training),  formal  training,  and  other Operations  and  Maintenance  (O&M)  costs,  including  Base  Operating  Support  (BOS), EIAP, and other support tail costs.  Within each COA, manpower tables should be used to depict  the  number  of  RegAF  (officer/enlisted/civilian/contractor)  manpower  required.  Manpower  tables  will  also  include  technicians  (officer/enlisted),  Active  Guard  and Reserve  (AGR)  (officer/enlisted),  traditional  reservists  (TRs)  (officer/enlisted),  drill status  guardsmen  (DSGs)  (officer/enlisted),  Title  5  civilians,  totals  for  each,  and proportional percentages of Full Time Support (FTS) and part-time manpower provided.  These tables must match the manpower tables used in  the A-Plan.  Table  3.1 provides  a template for developing manpower tables in the BCA. Table 3.1.  Manpower Table Template.   10 AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 3.2.1.3.  Address the benefits of each COA, which may include but should not be limited to aircraft utilization (UTE) rate, equipment and facility utilization, experience and skill levels, rotational capacity, surge capability, personnel retention, and dwell time capacity. 3.2.1.4.  Address risks for each alternative, which may include but should not be limited to  funding,  manpower,  end  strength,  UTE  rate,  ability/inability  to  meet  taskings, homeland defense, state missions, training capacity, aircrew and maintenance absorption and political viability. 3.2.1.5.  Identify a recommended COA.  Provide all relevant qualitative and quantitative reasons supporting the COA selection.  Ensure selection factors and information relating to  relative  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  COAs  is  captured  and  used  in  defining  the purpose and need in compliance with the EIAP. 3.2.2.  Force Mix Analysis.  Historically, the planning and creation of TFAs originated with the partnering MAJCOMs.  This  option remains available; however, the advent  of SP3 and the force mix analysis process, like HVA, provides an enterprise look at mission demand and required  supply  of  Airmen  for  that  demand,  which  may  in  turn,  justify  recommending  new TFAs.  Partnering MAJCOMs will coordinate with AF/A8XF to see if a HAF-directed force mix analysis will meet the DSD requirement. 3.2.3.  Additional TFAP Considerations.  Partnering MAJCOMs will ensure TFAPs comply with policy, Title 31 United States Code Section 1301 and other applicable laws.  Although not  all-inclusive  for  consideration,  partnering  MAJCOMs  will  study  the  following  when building their TFAPs: 3.2.3.1.  Strategic Basing.  MAJCOMs will comply with the requirements of AFI 10-503; 32 CFR §989; and when appropriate, DoDI 3200.18, Management and Operation of the Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB).  Basing actions requiring HAF approval will  use  the  process  outlined  in  AFI  10-503  unless  exempted  by  SAF/IEIB  or  the Strategic Basing Executive Steering Group (SB-ESG) during the course of staffing. 3.2.3.2.  Manpower  and  Personnel  Management.    Partnering  MAJCOMs  will  comply with AFI 38-201, Management of Manpower Requirements and Authorizations; AFI 36-2132,  Volume  1,  Air  Reserve  Technician  (ART)  Program;  AFI  36-2132,  Volume  2, Active  Guard/Reserve  (AGR)  Program;  ANGI  36-101,  Air  National  Guard  Active Guard/Reserve  (AGR)  Program;  and  ANGI  36-2001,  Management  of  Training  and Operational  Support  within  the  Air  National  Guard.    Additionally,  MAJCOMs  will ensure  TFAs  use  ARC  FTS  personnel  consistent  with  readiness  and  manpower requirements,  and  applicable  laws.    FTS  manpower  should  normally  be  limited  to  no more than 30 percent of total authorized ARC manpower.  FTS manpower exceeding 30 percent  will  require  justification  and  coordination  between  the  MAJCOM/JA  and AF/JAA.  Manpower standards for each mission set is ideal justification. 3.2.3.3.  Appropriations.    Organizational  structure  necessary  to  guarantee  compliance with  Purpose  Statute  (31  USC  §  1301) to  effectively  execute  congressional appropriations.    AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 11 3.3.  A-Plans.    The  Sponsor-MAJCOM,  in  coordination  with  the  Associate-MAJCOM,  will develop the A-Plan.  The A-Plan outlines details regarding the TFA’s purpose and background, association  details,  command  relationships,  mission  readiness,  funding  responsibilities, operational  employment,  and  transition  plan.    Development  of  the  A-Plan  is  mandatory  before executing  association  initiatives  and  sets  the  conditions  for  successful  implementation.    The partnering  MAJCOMs  will  utilize  Attachment  2  to  develop  the  A-Plan  and  follow  the  detailed guidance contained therein.  Partnering MAJCOMs should forward the draft A-Plan to AF/A8XF for  HAF  review  prior  to  final  signatures.    AF/A8XF  will  then  coordinate  with  necessary  HAF entities  to  ensure  the  preliminary  inputs  meet  TFA  requirements.    Partnering  MAJCOMs  will address  HAF  inputs  as  required  prior  to  coordinating  Sponsor  and  Associate-MAJCOM/A5-8 signatures.  The Sponsor-MAJCOM will ensure the final document is forwarded to AF/A8XF for TFEB review. 3.3.1.  Command  relationships.    Sponsor  and  associate  organizations  retain  Administrative        Control  (ADCON)  of  their  own  forces  separate  organizational  structures  to  include  Unit Manning Documents (UMDs) and chains of command.  ANG organizations must respond to requests from the governor of their state/territory and must fulfill those tasks consistent with provisions of public law.   Because  associated  organizations  and  their 3.3.2.  Operational  Direction  (OPDIR). respective  personnel  are  not  in  the  same  ADCON  chain-of-command,  MAJCOMs  must outline  general  OPDIR  and  functional  integration  lines  throughout  its  associated  units  to ensure unity of effort.  MAJCOMs will ensure development of specific OPDIR designations. 3.3.3.  Strategic  Basing  Issues  and  EIAP.    All  required  basing  actions  will  be  included  as milestones  in  the  A-Plan.    Sponsoring  MAJCOMs  will  comply  with  the  EIAP  and  ensure integration  of  the  EIAP  during  the  initial  planning  stages  of  TFA  proposed  actions  so  that planning and decisions reflect environmental values, delays are avoided later in the process, and potential conflicts are precluded (32 CFR §989.3(d)(1)). 3.4.  TFAP  Submission  to  HAF.  Partnering  MAJCOMs  will  submit  TFAPs  to  AF/A8XF  for scheduling a TFEB review.  TFAP packages will include (1) the DSD and (2) the A-Plan.  12 AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 4 TFAP REVIEW 4.1.  Overview.  This chapter outlines the HAF’s TFAP review process. 4.2.  TFAP  Review  Process.  AF/A8XF  is  the  single  point  of  entry  point  for  TFAPs  into  the HAF.  Partnering MAJCOMs will submit TFAPs to the HAF through AF/A8XF IAW paragraph 3.4.  AF/A8XF will schedule TFAPs  for presentation at  the TFEB as needed but  no more than quarterly.    AF/A8XF  will  notify  TFEB  members  when  the  AF/A8X  or  designated  O-7/SES representative plans to convene a TFEB.  TFEB members will review the TFAP documents prior to the TFEB. Figure 4.1.  TFAP Review. 4.3.  Total  Force  Evaluation  Board  (TFEB).  The  TFEB  is  a  HAF  consultative  and  review body  sponsored,  convened,  and  chaired  by  the  AF/A8X  or  designated  O-7/SES  representative.  The TFEB will review and evaluate all TFAPs.  The TFEB will review all TFAPs with regard to strategic guidance, benefits, and risk; specifically, the TFEB will review the DSD and A-Plan for accuracy, completeness, legal sufficiency, views of others and alignment with Air Force strategic and policy objectives.  4.3.1.  TFEB  Members.    TFEB  core  membership  consists  of  O-7  or  civilian  equivalent representatives  from  the  following:    AF/A1,  AF/A5/8,  AF/A9,  AF/JA,  SAF/IE,  SAF/LL,   SAF/MR,  and  SAF/PA.    As  needed,  functional  O-7  or  civilian  equivalent  representatives from  AF/A2,  AF/A3,  AF/A4,  AF/A10,  AF/RE,  AF/SG,  NGB/CF,  SAF/CIO  A6,  SAF/FM, and  SAF/GC  will  be  invited.    AF/A8XF  will  invite  the  appropriate  partnering  MAJCOM representatives to attend and provide their viewpoint(s) on respective TFAs.  The TFEB chair may adjust attendance and other MAJCOMs may request to attend. 4.3.2.  TFEB Concurrence.  When the TFEB concurs with a submitted TFAP, the following   actions will occur: 4.3.2.1.  VCSAF Approval.  TFEB will coordinate the TFAP for VCSAF approval. 4.3.2.2.  Documentation.    Once  approved  by  the  VCSAF,  AF/A8XF  will  send  TFEB approval documentation  to the partnering MAJCOM A5/8s; MAJCOMs will utilize this documentation to complete Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) updates linking the associated Personnel Accountability Symbol (PAS) codes.  AF/A8XF will also update its current listing of TFAs.    AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 13 4.3.2.3.  Programming Actions.  Partnering MAJCOMs will submit programming actions to  fund  the  approved  associations  as  documented  in  the  TFA.    TFEB  concurrence  with the TFAP does not guarantee funding for execution; TFAPs will compete for resourcing at MAJCOM and HAF levels like other programmatic issues. 4.3.2.4.  EIAP.    MAJCOMs  will  ensure  EIAP  compliance  throughout  the  process;  non-compliance could jeopardize the TFAP despite TFEB concurrence. 4.3.2.5.  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)/Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA).  MAJCOMS  will  develop  MOUs/MOAs  as  needed  prior  to  execution.    Occasionally  a Support  Agreement  may  be  required  to  document  recurring  support  and  eliminate unnecessary resource duplication. 4.3.3.  TFEB Non-Concurrence.  If any discrepancies or questions are highlighted during the review, the TFEB members will request clarification from the partnering MAJCOMs before recommending  HAF  concurrence.    Should  the  TFEB  non-concur  with  the  TFAP,  the   Chairperson  will  mediate  a  discussion  and  attempt  to  achieve  resolution.    If  a  resolution  is not  achievable  during  the  meeting,  the  Chairperson  will  accomplish  one  or  more  of  the following: 4.3.3.1.  Identify further actions required to resolve the issue and assign these actions to the appropriate organization(s). 4.3.3.2.  Determine that the issue does not warrant TFEB non-concurrence, in which case the Chairperson concurs with the TFAP, making note of the determination in the TFEB minutes and including views of others when coordinating with VCSAF for approval. 4.3.3.3.  Recommend the issue to the AF/A5/8 and MAJCOM counterparts for resolution.  14 AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 5 TFA ASSESSMENTS 5.1.  Assessments.  Partnering  MAJCOMs  will  assess  the  effectiveness  and  viability  of  their TFAs. 5.1.1.  Metrics  and  Measures  of  Merit  (MoMs).    During  the  assessment,  MAJCOMs  will consider the TFA’s objective, metrics, and MoMs set forth in the respective A-Plan. 5.1.2.  A-Plan  Review.    MAJCOMs  will  review  the  TFA’s  A-Plan  to  determine  whether  it accurately  reflects  the current  mission, work force,  and other related  factors.   If  changes to the  existing  A-Plan  surface,  the  Sponsor-MAJCOM/JA  will  provide  a  review  for  legal sufficiency.    Partnering  MAJCOMs  will  review  and  compile  this  data  with  completed MAJCOM/JA legal review.  Partnering MAJCOMs will then forward the revised A-Plan to AF/A8XF.    TFA  changes  may  require  the  partnering  MAJCOMs  to  submit  a  revised  DSD and/or A-Plan for TFEB review. 5.1.3.  Frequency.  Partnering MAJCOMs will assess their TFAs on a cycle no less frequent than  every  48-60  months,  but  may  align  these  assessments  with  the  Air  Force  Inspection System (AFIS) cycle.  Additionally, MAJCOMs will assess their associations if they undergo significant changes to mission, work force, or other related factors.  Significant changes may include but are not limited to mission changes, structural adjustments to the RegAF or ARC command  structure,  Organization  Change  Requests  (OCR)  and  Program  Change  Requests (PCR), relocation, and significant changes to manning or equipment assignments. 5.2.  Disassociation.  If the assessment determines the TFA is  generating  excessive costs, is  no longer  sustainable,  working  or  supporting  current  requirements,  the  partnering  MAJCOMs  will send a formal memo to AF/A8XF stating both MAJCOMs agree to disassociate. 5.2.1.  Documentation.    A  formal  memo  will  be  signed  by  the  MAJCOM  A5/8s  (or equivalent),  stating  the  disassociation  effective  date  of  the  affected  TFA,  and  define  any changes required in the status of the aircraft or equipment shared by the components prior to disassociation.    AF/A8XF  will  staff  this  for  VCSAF  acknowledgement  and  then  update  its current listing of TFAs. 5.2.2.  Programming Actions.  MAJCOMs identify and plan for any budgetary or legislative impacts tied to the disassociation.  Note:  Transfers of aircraft from the ARC to the RegAF must comply with DoDI 1225.06, Equipping the Reserve Forces, and AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting, and Termination.

with one or more RegAF Associate Organizations. Active  Guard  and  Reserve  (AGR)—National  Guard  and  Reserve  members  who  are  on voluntary  active  duty  providing  full-time  support  to  National  Guard,  Reserve  and  Active Component organizations for the purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the Reserve Components. (JP 1-02.  Source: CJCSM 3150.13C) Air Force Auxiliary (AFAUX)—The Air Force Auxiliary is the Title 10 status of the volunteer Civil  Air Patrol when Civil Air Patrol is  performing Air Force-assigned  missions in support of federal agencies, including the Air Force. Air Reserve Component (ARC)—The Air Reserve Component of the Air Force consists of the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve. Associate-MAJCOM—The  Associate-MAJCOM the development of a TFAP to establish a new TFA, or to change an existing one.  The associating organization of the TFA is subordinate to the Associate MAJCOM. the  MAJCOM is that  supports Associate  Organization—The  Associate  Organization  is  the  partner  unit  forming  a  TFA  and subordinate to the Associate MAJCOM.  The associate organization shares the primary physical resources  assigned  to  the  sponsor  organization,  and  may  provide  additional  physical  resources necessary to support the shared mission.  Associate organizations will vary from full or tailored wings to groups, squadrons, and detachments, depending on the scope of the shared mission. Association  Plan  (A-Plan)—A-Plans  outline  association-unique  issues,  including  purpose  and objectives; organizational structure; command relationships; base support; manpower categories and  numbers;  plans  for  functional  integration;  shared  resources;  and  budget  requirements.    A-Plans will furthermore identify quantifiable objective-level and MoMs for the TFA. Civil Air Patrol (CAP)—The CAP is a component of the USAF’s Total Force when conducting Air Force assigned missions as the official Air Force Auxiliary. Classic Association (CA)—A CA is a construct in which a RegAF Sponsor Organization shares a mission with one or more ARC Associate Organizations. Core  Function  Lead  (CFL)—SecAF/CSAF-appointed  senior  leader  responsible  for  specific Core Functions (CF) providing AF-level, long-term views.  CFLs integrate Total Force concepts, capabilities, modernization, and resourcing to ensure future assigned core capabilities across the range of military operations as directed by AF Strategy and Strategic Planning Guidance.  CFLs are responsible for the Core Function Support Plan and recommendations for the development of the  POM  for  the  assigned  CF.    CFLs  have  tasking  authority  regarding  CF  issues  to  identify enabling capabilities and integration requirements/opportunities.  20 AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 Core  Function  Support  Plans  (CFSP)—MAJCOM  and  CFL  staffs  develop  these  plans  to support  annual  refinement  of  the  fiscally  constrained  30-year  Resource  Allocation  Plan, capability  gap  prioritization,  capabilities  investment,  and  Science  and  Technology  priorities.  CFSPs  provide  detailed  analysis  in  support  of  the  AF  Strategy  and  Strategic  Master  Plan objectives and an entry into the Strategy, Planning and Programming Process. Decision  Support  Document  (DSD)—A  document  that  presents  alternatives,  costs,  benefits, and  risks  of  the  proposal.    This  data  supports  justification  of  a  TFA  in  conjunction  with  an  A-Plan.  The tool could be a BCA or AF/A5/8 endorsed force mix analysis. Drill  Status  Guardsman  (DSG)—Air  National  Guard  members  who  participate  in  Unit Training Assembly (UTA), traditionally one weekend per month and a two-week annual training period.  They are also known as Traditional Guardsman (ANGI 36-2002); status can be verified through member's servicing personnel office. Dual  Status  Military  Technicians  (MT)—MT’s are civilian employees whose primary duties are  to  organize,  administer,  instruct,  or  train  (OAIT)  reserve  components  and  who  have  a requirement to also be TRs or DSGs.  MTs may also maintain and repair supplies and equipment (including aircraft) issued to the armed forces as a primary duty. Environmental  Impact  Analysis  Process  (EIAP)—Under  the  EIAP,  all  alternatives  must  be evaluated and considered by the decision maker, prior to making any commitment of resources.  The EIAP is implemented in the Air Force by 32 CFR §989.  The EIAP is compiled with either a Categorical Exclusion, an Environmental Assessment, or an Environmental Impact Statement. Force Mix Analysis (FMA)—An AF/A5/8 endorsed enterprise-level analysis of a mission area to  examine  mission  feasibility  across  a  range  of  RegAF/ARC  force  mix  options,  like  the  High Velocity Analysis.  The analysis must be based upon the associated outputs, costs, benefits and risks. Force  Mix  Option  (FMO)—A  representative  RegAF/ARC  force  composition  for  a  weapon system or career field used during a force mix analysis to examine mission feasibility. Functional Integration—Functional integration refers to the mission alignment of full-time and part-time personnel, training, and/or resources within an organization or between organizations.  Commanders  functionally  integrate  across  the  Air  Force  to  maintain  readiness  and  efficiently organize, train, and equip forces.  Functional integration occurs through command-level MOAs, personnel assignments, aligning collocated organizations, and formalizing TFAs. High  Velocity  Analysis  (HVA)—An  AF/A5/8  endorsed  enterprise-level  analysis  of  a  mission area to examine mission feasibility across a range of RegAF/ARC force mix options based upon the associated outputs, costs, benefits and risks.  See also Force Mix Analysis. Host  Base  MAJCOM—The  host  base  MAJCOM  is  the  MAJCOM  that  is  responsible  for supporting  the  installation  on  which  the  TFA  resides.    The  host  base  MAJCOM  could  be  the Sponsor-MAJCOM, Associate-MAJCOM, or a different MAJCOM.  If the host base MAJCOM is  not  one  of  the  TFA’s  Sponsor  or  Associate  MAJCOMs,  the  Sponsor-MAJCOM  must coordinate with the host base MAJCOM prior to forming a TFA. Measure  of  Merit  (MoM)—A  MoM  defines  when  an  objective  has  been  achieved  --  that  is, how to measure the effect of an objective/task.  AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 21 Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)—A  type  of  intra-service,  intra-agency,  or  inter-agency agreement  between  two  or  more  parties,  which  includes  specific  terms  that  are  agreed  to,  and commitment  by  at  least  one  party  to  engage  in  action.    It  either  includes  a  commitment  of resources or binds a party to a specific action.  (Source: AFI 25-201, Intra-Service, Intra-Agency, and Inter-Agency Support Agreements Procedures) Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)—A  type  of  intra-service,  intra-agency,  or  inter-agency  agreement  between  two  or  more  parties,  which  includes  only  a  general  understanding between the parties.  It neither includes commitment of resources nor binds a party to a specific action.  (Source: AFI 25-201, Intra-Service, Intra-Agency, and Inter-Agency Support Agreements Procedures) Operational Direction (OPDIR)—OPDIR is a Service specific term that describes the authority of  a  member  of  one  component  to  designate  objectives,  assign  tasks,  and  provide  direction  to members  of  another  component  necessary  to  accomplish  steady-state  duties  other  than operational missions and ensure unity of effort.  OPDIR further clarifies coordinating authority doctrine  administered  between  Air  Force  commanders  through  MOUs  and  MOAs  to  achieve unity  of  effort  in  the  context  of  steady  state  organize,  train,  and  equip  activities  and  missions.  OPDIR  enables  functional  supervisors  from  any  component  to  direct  personnel  from  another component  detailed  under  their  supervision,  and  does  not  apply  in  the  context  of  military operations under the command and control of a Combatant Commander. Partnering  MAJCOMs—The  Sponsor  and  Associate  MAJCOMs  that  maintain  ADCON  over the associating units. Sponsor-MAJCOM—The Sponsor-MAJCOM is the MAJCOM that leads the development of a TFAP to establish a new TFA, or to change an existing one.  The Sponsor-MAJCOM is normally the  MAJCOM  of  the  Sponsor  Organization.    Sponsor-MAJCOMs  will  develop  association documentation  for  the  TFAP  package  in  accordance  with  this  AFI  and  with  coordination  with other  Partnering  MAJCOMs,  including  the  MAJCOM  that  controls  the  installation(s)  in question. Sponsor  Organization—The  Sponsor  Organization  is  the  sponsor  unit  forming  a  TFA  and subordinate  to  the  Sponsor  MAJCOM.    The  sponsor  organization  is  the  organization  with primary responsibility for mission accomplishment and normally assigned the preponderance of the primary physical resources (e.g. aircraft, weapon system equipment, weapon system support, and  production  facilities).    Sponsor  organization  status  does  not  imply  ownership  of  an installation.    Sponsor  organizations  will  vary  from  full  or  tailored  wings  to  groups,  squadrons, and detachments, depending on the scope of the shared mission. Support  Agreement—Support  agreements  must  be  developed  between  affected  Suppliers  and Receivers  to  document  recurring  support  in  order  to  provide  the  unit  commander  with  the capability  to  ensure  resources  are  expended  wisely  and  to  help  eliminate  unnecessary  resource duplication.  Support agreements are also used for single or non-recurring reimbursable support and  non-reimbursable  support.    (Source:  AFI  25-201,  Intra-Service,  Intra-Agency,  and  Inter-Agency Support Agreements Procedures) Total  Force  Associations  (TFAs)—TFAs  are  formal  agreements  between  two  or  more  USAF component organizations that agree to share resources to perform a common mission.  The HAF  22 AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 assigns  missions  to  the  individual  component  organizations,  not  the  TFA.    The  individual organizations associating to form a TFA will follow the organizational mandates outlined in AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. Total  Force  Association  Proposals  (TFAPs)—TFAPs  include  DSDs  and  A-Plans.    The Sponsor-MAJCOM,  in  coordination  with  the  Associate-MAJCOM(s),  submits  proposals  to  the TFEB for evaluation and approval. Total Force Evaluation Board (TFEB)—AF/A8X-led body from across the TF, which reviews TFAPs for HAF concurrence. Traditional  Reservist  (TR)—A  drilling  unit  member  of  the  Air  Force  Reserve  (Selected Reserve) who must participate in at least 48 scheduled drills or training periods during each year.  TRs  must  also  serve  on  active  duty  for  training  of  not  less  than  14  days  during  each  year,  or serve  on  active  duty  for  training  not  more  than  30  days  during  each  year  (10  U.S.C.  10143, 10147).  TRs can be mobilized (voluntarily or involuntarily) to active duty. Unit  Equipped—Either a RegAF or ARC formal unit that is authorized MDS or other mission essential  equipment  to  perform  a  mission,  whether  for  a  combat  coded  mission  or  training mission, such as a Formal Training Unit (FTU) or other assigned mission.  Associations are not formal  units  and  are  not  considered  “unit  equipped”.    The  Sponsor  Organization  is  generally considered  the  “unit  equipped”  organization  that  shares  its  equipment  with  the  Associate Organization.  The procedures for sharing of the equipment and funding responsibilities will be defined  in  the  A-Plan  and  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  between  the  Sponsor Organization and Associate Organization. Unity  of  Effort—Coordination  and  cooperation  toward  common  objectives,  even  if  the participants are not necessarily part of the same command or organization, which is the product of successful unified action.

If  not  a  partnering  MAJCOM,  outline  which  MAJCOM  hosts  the  installation on          which the association will reside. A2.2.3.2.  Highlight  what  base  and  community  services  are  and  are  not  available  for Airmen  of  each  component  and  OPRs  to  help  mitigate  risks  and  resolve  issues  (if applicable). A2.2.3.3.  List  any  strategic  basing  issues  that  exist  that  could  preclude  the  association from  forming  at  this  location.    [e.g.,  environmental  impact  analysis  needed;  test  and evaluation and/or range issues to consider] A2.2.4.  MANPOWER  CATEGORIES  AND  NUMBERS.  Integration  of  Active  and Reserve component members supporting the Classic/Active MDS/Mission Set Association at Base Name AFB(s) is essential to meeting the association’s objective(s). A2.2.4.1.  RegAF  MAJCOM  MANPOWER  REQUIREMENTS.    RegAF  requirements are  captured  in  Table  A2.1.    There  are  no  /  number  requirements  for  Top  Secret/SCI billets. Table A2.1.  RegAF Manpower.   ARC  manpower A2.2.4.2.  ARC  MAJCOM  MANPOWER  REQUIREMENTS. requirements are captured in Table A2.2.  The ## WG and ## WG MOU provides further details  on  how  RegAF  and  ARC  UTCs  will  support  deployments  and  other  mission requirements.  There are no / required number requirements for Top Secret/SCI billets.   26 AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 Table A2.2.  ARC Manpower.  A2.2.4.2.1.  Outline the  number of AGRs,  ARTs, and TRs/DSGs at  initial  operating capability (IOC) and desired full operational capability (FOC) endstate.  Consider the minimum and expected normal monthly availability of TRs/DSGs. A2.2.4.2.2.  Describe  any  duties  to  be  performed  by  FTS  personnel  that  do  not directly  involve  organizing,  or  administering  the  reserves,  recruiting,  instructing  or training reservisits, the ARC, or maintaining federal military supplies or equipment of the armed forces (military technicians only). A2.2.4.2.3.  If the proportion of FTS manpower is greater than 30 percent of the total number  of  ARC  members  in  the  unit  for  this  association,  explain  the  ARC requirement(s)  that  justify  departure  from  historical  congressional  authorizations  of FTS manpower proportions.  If a formal MAJCOM (or above) manpower assessment has  been  accomplished  to  validate  that  the  total  proposed  manpower  footprint (RegAF and ARC) is required for the mission in question, indicate date accomplished and overall result (concur, concur w/changes, etc). A2.2.4.3.  MANPOWER AND CREW RATIO TIMELINE.  RegAF and ARC manpower   changes (increases and/or decreases) are outlined by Fiscal Year in Table A2.3.  AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 27 Table A2.3.  RegAF and ARC Manpower and Crew Ratio Timeline. A2.2.5.  FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION AND MISSION EMPLOYMENT.  A2.2.5.1.  Explain how this Classic/Active Association integrates personnel from the ## WG with the ## WG.  Specifically, describe which units will functionally integrate.  If a core  of  personnel  will  not  functionally  integrate  but  serve  in  direct  support  of  distinct requirements  relating  to  ARC  program  execution  and  management,  provide  the  number and duty status of ARC personnel in these positions and where the positions fall.  Outline operational employment details as required. A2.2.5.2.  Will the ARC unit be providing formal training to individuals other than ARC personnel?  If yes, provide the estimated ratio of instructors from each component and the estimated ratio of students  from  each component  (Note:   for these purposes, training of foreign  students  or  civilians  should  be  attributable  to  the  component  requesting  the training). A2.2.5.3.  Does  the  TFA  require  federal  operational  missions,  or  members  of  an associated unit, to  perform/support federal  operational missions on a routine basis (e.g., day-to-day, or as a regular part of their military activities – other than unit mobilization)?  If  yes, describe the manner in  which ARC members will be used to  support or perform federal  operations  and  missions  (include  an  explanation  as  to  whether  the  primary purpose  of  ARC  members’  activities  is  to  support  or  perform  federal  operations  and missions or whether the support/performance is incidental to training).  If yes, when ARC members are supporting federal operations and missions, identify the ARC organization to which they will be attached and the operational chain of command. A2.2.5.4.  Will  the  unit  be  involved  in  intelligence  collection,  analysis,  storage,  or distribution IAW AFI 14-104, Oversight of Intelligence Activities?  If yes, identify which superior  organization  will  be  responsible  for  intelligence  oversight  compliance  of  the  28 AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 units/association.  If uyes, describe how the unit will comply with intelligence oversight training requirements. A2.2.6.  SHARED RESOURCE COMMITMENTS. A2.2.6.1.  Outline how the sponsor and associate units will share resources (e.g., aircraft, equipment, facilities) during normal, full-time work weeks, and UTA weekends.  Further refinement  of  the  commitments  will  be  detailed  with  associating  unit  MOUs/MOAs and/or Host Tenant Support Agreement(s) (HTSA). A2.2.6.2.  If sharing aircraft, explain what the minimum sortie requirements are for both components and how both components will be afforded training and sorties (to the extent they are available) at an equitable rate to maintain Combat Mission Ready (CMR)/BMC status  IAW MAJCOM Ready Aircrew Program (RAP); consider sortie distribution, off-station training/deployments, and other considerations. A2.2.6.3.  If  sharing  aircraft,  AGE,  simulator,  ground  training  facilities,  life  support, vehicles,  supplies,  etc.,  required  to  support  the  training  of  associate  personnel,  the Associate-MAJCOM  will  plan  for  necessary  supplies,  parts,  fuel,  etc.    Highlight  if Sponsor-MAJCOM support is required (e.g., personnel). A2.2.6.4.  If associating personnel will share/use sponsor facilities and equipment, outline sponsor’s  responsibilities  for  operation  and  maintenance.    Associate-MAJCOM  will validate all space requirements for Associated Unit(s) and Associate-MAJCOM will fund any sole-use facility work, Comprehensive Interior Design (CID), or furniture costs. A2.2.6.5.  Sponsor-MAJCOM/IG  and  Associate-MAJCOM/IG  will  coordinate  and conduct  inspections  IAW AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System,  and applicable MAJCOM guidance.  Inspections that fall outside the purview of IG will be coordinated between partnering MAJCOMS to ensure associated units are evaluated concurrently. A2.2.7.  BUDGET/FINANCIAL  REQUIREMENTS.  (A-plan  should  reflect  what  the DSD states)  The Air Force guidance memorandum (AFGM) to AFGM2016-01 to AFI 65-601,  Volume  1,  Budget  Guidance  and  Procedures,  provides  guidance  regarding  mixed funding  scenarios  for  sourcing  O&M  appropriations  for  certain  ARC  personnel  activities applicable to associations. A2.2.7.1.  Operational  utilization  of  ARC  personnel  will  be  deliberately  planned  and programmed  throughout  the  Future  Years  Defense  Plan  (FYDP).    ARC  operational utilization  requirements  planning  must  include  specific  objectives  to  be  achieved (requirements), the rationale and justification for the intended utilization, and estimates of manday  and  support  tail  costs.    The  requirements  justification  should  also  clearly  state whether the intended operational utilization was a critical assumption in the formation of the association.  Requirements planning should inform  both  core function support plans as well as annual  POM submissions.  Specifically identifying recurring use of the ARC that  sustains  total  force  operational  capability  will  enhance  PPBE  processes,  increase resource  stability,  and  ensure  timely  access  to  skilled  and  experienced  ARC  personnel.  Outline  the  process/timelines  for  partnering  units  to  forecast  and  request  Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) and Reserve Personnel Appropriation (RPA) (to include travel  and  per-diem  for  non-local  TRs)  IAW  with  AFI  36-2619,  Military  Personnel Appropriation  (MPA)  Man-Day  Program.    Provide  steady-state/day-to-day  forecasts  AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 29 based on historic estimates/student pipelines, which is validated by the MAJCOM MPA Manday Management Office. Table A2.4.

Emerging/surge requirements could drive unplanned MPA or RPA during the year of execution.  Outline the process for partnering units to request additional MPA or RPA. A2.2.7.3.  Explain  specific  RegAF  and  ARC  component  funding  responsibilities  with Sponsor-MAJCOM and Associate-MAJCOM.  Details should consider things like flying hour  program  details,  operations  and  maintenance  costs,  government  purchase  cards, initial  beddown  expenses,  TDY  travel  and  per  diem,  MILCON  projects,  processes  to account for additional/unexpected expenditures. A2.2.7.4.  Does the TFA, or members of an associated unit, support operational activities and support of federal missions on a routine basis (e.g., day-to-day, or as a regular part of their military activities – other than unit mobilization)?  Does the TFA, or members of an associated unit, require ARC to train other components?  If yes, describe the procedures that will be used to account for costs and charge costs to the proper appropriations.  This should include, but not be limited to, the number of man hours ARC members support or perform  federal  operations  or  missions  (if  not  done  incidental  to  training  or  authorized ARC  activities);  ARC  resources  (e.g.,  flying  hours,  materials)  expended  in  support  of federal  operations  and  missions  (if  not  done  incidental  to  training  or  authorized  ARC activities); incremental increase in ARC resources expended (man hours and other costs) related to training RegAF or supporting federal operations or missions.  If reimbursement is not required because the expenditure of ARC resources in support of federal operations or  missions  is  proportional  to  the  reciprocal  benefit  received  by  the  RegAF  ARC  unit, incidental to ARC training, or otherwise authorized to be performed by ARC personnel, describe the underlying arrangements, rationale, and safeguards to ensure ARC resources are properly used. A2.2.7.5.  Identify  the  organization(s)  that  will  be  responsible  for  programming  for shared  resources  and  how  costs  will  be  shared  and/or  reimbursed  (e.g.,  flying  hours).  AFI  65-601,  Volume  1,  Budget  Guidance  and  Procedures  provides  guidance  regarding mixed funding scenarios applicable to associations. A2.2.7.6.  Document how the RegAF and ARC will increase or decrease manpower due to mission changes.  Specific rules should be developed defining how the increases will be  distributed  between  the  components  and  how  manpower  decreases  will  be  taken  30 AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 during  mission  reductions  (i.e.,  percentage  of  contribution  to  overall  mission,  one component only). A2.3.  MISSION READINESS. A2.3.1.  TRANSITION  PLAN  TO  MEET  TFA  OBJECTIVES.  Outline  specific,  time-based milestones each organization will need to meet for the association to reach the outlined objectives.    Ensure  assumptions,  numbers,  and  deadlines  identified  in  the  BCA  do  not conflict with milestones provided here. DD Month YYYY:  secure formal training allocations for # personnel DD Month YYYY:  two full crews trained/mx launch 2-ship independently DD Month YYYY:  initial operational capability (IOC) DD Month YYYY:  ability to meet wartime task (reported in Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) by each component) DD Month YYYY:  execution of programmed FHP DD Month YYYY:  full operational capability (FOC) A2.3.2.  MEASURES  OF  MERIT  (MoMs).  MoMs  for  this  Classic/Active  Association have  been  determined  through  coordination  with  the  Sponsor-MAJCOM,  Associate-MAJCOM,  and  the  associating  units.    These  metrics  will  help  evaluate  whether  the association  is  creating  the  desired  effect.    When  possible,  MoMs  should  utilize  established systems  of  record,  such  as  MilPDS,  DRRS,  and  Logistics  Installation  Mission  Support-Enterprise View (LIMS-EV). A2.3.2.1.  Proposed Objective #1:  Outline the TFA’s first objective. A2.3.2.1.1.  Describe a MoM to help measure success for Proposed Objective #1. A2.3.2.1.2.  Outline  and  describe  additional  MoMs  to  help  measure  success  for Proposed Objective #1 as separate bullets. A2.3.2.2.  Proposed Objective #2:  Outline additional TFA objectives as separate bullets. A2.3.2.2.1.  Describe a MoM to help measure success for Proposed Objective #2. A2.3.2.2.2.  Outline  and  describe  additional  MoMs  to  help  measure  success  for Proposed Objective #2 as separate bullets.   AFI90-1001  9 JANUARY 2017 31 Attachment 3 DISASSOCIATION MEMORANDUM TEMPLATE        DD Month YYYY  MEMORANDUM FOR AF/A8X FROM:  Sponsor-MAJCOM and Associate-MAJCOM SUBJECT:  Disassociation Request for Classic/Active Associate between the Sponsor Unit (Sponsor-MAJCOM) and Associate Unit (Associate-MAJCOM) at Location  The Total Force Association (TFA) between Sponsor Unit (Sponsor-MAJCOM) and Associated Unit (Associated-MAJCOM) at Location plans to disassociate.  This TFA warrants disassociation because (state the reason for disassociating for example: generating excessive costs or is no longer sustainable, working or supporting current requirements).
