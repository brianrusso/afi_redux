It doesn't replace equipment technical orders that are the official directives for this equipment.  The publication is divided into three sections:  Section I.  Description and characteristics of the AN/TPX-42A controls, functions and operating indications.  Section II.  Familiarization and display interpretations.  Section III.  TPX-49 operating instructions.  5AT-E-07  JULY 04 The AN/TPX-42A interrogator set provides a beacon system that works with, but gives separate and additional capabilities to our radar air traffic control facilities.  The set has four major modes available, Modes 1, 2, 3/A, and C.  Modes 1 and 2 are for military use.  Mode 3/A, which now has a 4096 code capability, is the common civil/military mode.  Mode C displays direct altitude read-out and is continuously operable.  It is automatically interlaced with Mode 3/A, and causes specific altitude data from cooperative IFF targets to be displayed on the plan position indicator (PPI) when desired.  The AN/TPX-42A will interrogate aircraft on all selected modes used, within an altitude range of -1,000 feet to 127,000 feet.  An indicator control (A box), installed at each operating position, permits you to select up to 10 channels using basic (64 code) and/or discrete (4096 code) decoding for display on the associated PPI.  You have the option of selecting beacon radar video on aircraft replying to discrete codes, or a combined presentation.  Through target filtering, only those targets meeting specific identity or altitude criteria are displayed to the controller concerned.  This reduces target clutter on the radar indicators.  The AN/TPX-42A reinforces the primary radar target through the use of brackets, and beacon and radar video information also complement one another on the radar display since the systems are made range coincident.  The information presented is unmistakably associated with the corresponding aircraft’s radar return.  The data displays, or tags, consist of target symbols, numeric identity codes, altitude numerics, bracket video, and other special symbols.  This allows you to rapidly identify, understand, and control your aircraft individually at each PPI.  The AN/TPX-42A also provides constant monitoring of emergencies, communications failures, and hijackings independent of indicator range.  Feature included are aural and visual alarms for such activity.  To aid in target identification, a Special Position Identification (SPI) pulse may be used with any of the codes upon request.  You also have the choice of displaying small position symbols, called trail dots, showing the previous locations of traffic.  This feature gives you an indication of the aircraft’s direction and velocity.  You have the option to hold back part, or all, of the information, and place the identity code and altitude numerics (tag) in a position north, south, east, or west of the aircraft position symbol, or centered upon it.  This gives you some control in relieving overlapping display situations.  These AN/TPX-42A features minimize controller-to-controller and controller-to-pilot coordination by providing needed information automatically.  This allows both the controller and pilot to devote more time to other critical tasks.  It also relieves frequency congestion, and allows both the controller and the pilot to make necessary radio contacts without delay.  Aircraft equipped with an automatic altitude reporting transponder will continuously provide you with their altitude information, simplifying traffic advisories and reducing frequency congestion.  6AT-E-07  JULY 04 ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS  AART - Automatic Altitude Reporting Transponder A Box - Indicator Control A/C - Aircraft ALT - Altitude APGU - Azimuth Pulse Generator Unit ASR - Airport Surveillance Radar ATC - Air Traffic Control ATCRBS - Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System AZ - Azimuth B Box - Interrogator Set Control (Master Control Panel) BRKT - Bracket COMM - Communications DAIR - Direct Altitude Identification Readout DMR - Dimmer D Switch - Discrete Feature EMER - Emergency FL - Flight Level IFF - Identification Friend or Foe INTERR - Interrogator INTRG - Interrogator IR - Interrogator Receiver LO - Low MAX - Maximum MI - Mile NMI - Nautical Mile OVRD - Override POSN - Position PPI - Plan Position Indicator PWR - Power RABM - Range Azimuth Beacon Monitor RDC - Reduced RF - Radio Frequency SIF - Selective Identification Feature SLS - Side Lobe Suppression SPI - Special Position Identification FRUIT - Clutter On Radar Display-False Displays And Code Garbling TAG - Data Displays Consisting Of Target Symbols, Bracket Video, Identity Codes, Etc TRAIL DOTS - Small Position Symbols Indicating Previous Aircraft Positions (Track) COOPERATIVE AIRCRAFT - Transponder Equipped Aircraft RING AROUND - False Targets On Several Radials At The Same Range As The True Target  7AT-E-07  JULY 04 SECTION I DESCRIPTION AND GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS AN/TPX-42A CONTROLS, FUNCTIONS, AND OPERATING INDICATIONS  The operational controls of the AN/TPX-42A consist of two types of control boxes:  A box and B box.  An A box (Indicator Control) is located at each ASR scope and contains the controls and indicators required by the operator to control the selection of target data at each particular radar display.  The B box (Interrogator Set Control) is the master control panel and contains the controls and indicators needed for selecting the various AN/TPX-42A capabilities and available features.  It is used to monitor and control major functions of all operating positions.  Both the A and B boxes include press switches that have off/on functions and illuminate when on.  At those locations equipped with Programmable Indicator Data Processor (PIDP) systems, not all of the switch functions of the A and B Box apply, those switch functions not used at PIDP locations will be identified by an “*”.  Some switch functions in this document have been replaced by a keyboard sequence or moved to the Indicator Control Front panel assembly of the PIDP equipment.  See the PIDP Operators Manual for functions transferred to the PIDP equipment.  A BOX (INDICATOR CONTROL)  This section describes the operational controls of the A box.  Using Figure 4, located in the back of this guide, and Table 1 below, associate the function of each control to its location on the A box.     A Box - Operator's Controls and Indicators Table 1 CONTROL/INDICATOR                                                             FUNCTION  ALTITUDE FILTER SWITCH     *This thumbwheel control consists of two sets of switches with numeric indicators that limit the display of Mode C readouts to a specific altitude/flight level layer, and an ALT FILT (altitude filter) button.  The desired layer is selected by setting the top elevation of the layer with the UPPER LIMIT switches, and bottom elevation of the layer with the LOWER LIMIT switches.  Limits are expressed in 100-foot increments from 000 to 999.                *When selected, the ALT FILT (altitude filter) button will filter out Mode C beacon returns from aircraft transponding altitude information above or below the selected altitude/flight level limits.  As a result, target formats                for these aircraft won't be displayed.  Accepted altitude filtered targets (targets with Mode C replies which fall within the selected layer) are displayed with the select aircraft position symbol (X) or the all aircraft position symbol (O) with code/altitude numerics if selected.  UPPER LIMIT150ALTFILTLOWER LIMIT100 ALTITUDEFILTERSWITCHES                 8AT-E-07                                                        MODE SELECTED INDICATOR            3A  12           MODE SELECT SWITCH            C       JULY 04   NOTE 1: Above FL 180 the AN/TPX-42A sensors   produce an altitude signal referenced to standard altimeter 29.92.  Below FL 180 this signal is corrected to the station altimeter.  Use caution when setting the top layer elevation at or near FL 160 since aircraft passing through  FL 180 can have a variance in altitude readout of up to 2,000 feet.  With the ALT FILT switch on, a descending aircraft could be filtered from the display until descending through 16,600 feet. NOTE 2: Altitude correction in the continental US is based on the transition altitude (FL 180). Areas outside the US use different transition altitudes. Targets replying without Mode C, or garbled / invalid Mode C replies are forced displayed as if they were within the altitude filter zone with the appropriate position symbols (X or O) surrounded by a box.  This box isn't displayed for "ident" or "SPI " replies.  Forced displays only occur when the controller has activated either the same select code channel position switch as the target, or the ALL A/C POSN switch.  Again, as in all altitude displays, slash characters (///) indicate that no altitude data is available and is displayed in conjunction with the box symbol and code.  Valid Mode C replies from targets reported over 99,900 feet still display three dashes ( - - - ) in place of altitude numerics.  Regardless of the altitude/flight level, emergency, hijack, and communications failure replies, with or without Mode C, are forced displayed onto the radar indicator.  Positions are displayed by the symbol X (surrounded by a box if not within the altitude filter layer) with the appropriate code and altitude, if selected.     These four green indicators, when lit, indicate the    interrogation modes being transmitted by the  transmitter-receiver.        2C3C1CMODE SELECTORSWITCH                   Selects the mode for code display interrogation, with Mode C automatically interlaced.        SWITCH POSITION     lC  2C  3C               INTERLACE Mode 1 and Mode C Mode 2 and Mode C Mode 3/A and Mode C Each switch position lights an associated green indicator.  The actual interlace pattern being transmitted is observed on the 1/2/3A/C indicators described above.  The position for ATC use is 3C. CAUTION:  Unattended A boxes should be left in the 3C position at all times to prevent “lock out” at the other positions. 9AT-E-07  EMERGENCY INDICATOR    EMERCOMMFLRRANGEERROR                          RDCRANGEINTERRDEFRUIT COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE         EMERRDCRANGECOMMFLRRANGEERRORINTERRDEFRUIT                           RANGE ERROR INDICATOR  EMERCOMMFLRRANGEERRORRDCRANGEINTERRDEFRUIT                                     JULY 04  NOTE: The AN/TPX-42A can interrogate in four separate Modes: C, 3/A, 2, and 1.   However it can only interlace three different modes at any one time.  Mode C is always interrogated so there are two options for all indicators positions.  If this limitation is exceeded, there are two types of priority systems that select which request is dropped or disregarded (the particular priority system in use at your location depends on equipment configuration and is selected by maintenance).  One priority system automatically drops Mode 1.  With this information, you can see the importance of returning your MODE SELECTOR to mode 3A when not actually being used to interrogate Mode 1 or 2.   This indicator flashes red when an emergency or hijack code is received.  An audible alarm also sounds three times within 5 seconds (approximately one full scan) unless reactivated by another emergency/hijack squawk.  To aid in locating the aircraft on the radar presentation, the emergency /hijack aircraft's position will be marked with an X and the 7700/7500 code readout will be forced onto the display regardless of functions selected.  Mode C altitude is also received, but only if the SELECT ALT (select altitude) switch is on.  The position symbol and numerics blink on and off at a rapid rate to attract attention, and continue to blink, along with the EMER (emergency indicator), until the aircraft changes code.  Automatic monitoring is available up to 200 miles unless the RANGE SELECT switch (B box) is on reduced range.  Note: Locations using PIDP will have the bearing and distance of aircraft squawking 7700/7500 displayed in the OP list.  This indicator flashes red and the aural alarm sounds when a communication failure (7600) squawk is received.  The symbology/numerics are forced on the display and flash the same as the reply for an emergency/hijack code.   NOTE: When a communications failure (7600) squawk is received, both the COMM FLR indicator and EMER indicator will flash.  A communications failure is a valid emergency condition.  The COMM FLR indicator specifies the type of emergency condition.  An audible alarm sounds and this indicator glows red when loss of range coincidence is detected.  When this occurs, the RANGE OVRD (range override) switch at the B box must be activated immediately or the beacon system shuts down.  Once overridden, the RANGE ERROR indicator flashes red.  At this point, the range accuracy may be impaired   10AT-E-07  JULY 04 REDUCED RANGE INDICATOR   RDC  INTERRDEFRUITRANGE                                                                 INTERROGATION INDICATOR   RANGEERRORCOMMFLR    EMER      This indicator glows red to indicate that a range other than   MAX has been selected at the B box.     This indicator glows green to indicate RF interrogations are   being transmitted by the receiver-transmitter group.  This indicator glows green when the interference blanker (DEFRUIT ON) switch on the B box is activated.   NOTE: It is important to confirm that the A Box, DEFRUIT indicator lights when the Defruit is selected on the B Box, and the indicator extinguishes when the B Box Defruit option is deactivated.  This is the only way to confirm that the DEFRUIT control circuits are functioning properly. *When activated, small circle symbols are displayed on the radar indicator denoting the true position of all beacon targets other than discrete codes selected by the ten identity filter switches described later.  No other ALL A/C (all aircraft) functions can be selected until this switch is activated.  *Used to select individual code numerics of targets not selected by the identity filter switches.  When selected, numerics are     displayed along side each of the small circle position symbols      on the radar indicator.                                      *Enables generation of individual altitude numerics display for   all aircraft not selected by identity filter Switches.     NOTE: When the ALL A/C POSN (all aircraft position) switch is depressed, the D switch (discrete) is automatically overridden, allowing display of all nonselected aircraft symbology/numerics as well as discrete targets.  *Activates a bracket video control slash on all displays on aircraft transmitting beacon replies to reinforce normal radar returns.  A two beacon slash appears on the indicator when the pilot “idents”.

One to three dots appear behind the position symbol showing the target's previous scan positions.  The number of dots displayed after each current target depends on the total number of targets being processed by the memory bank, not on the number of targets displayed. When the interrogator is processing less than 33 target formats, three dots appear.  When 33, but less than 43, formats are processed, two dots appear.  When 43, but not more than 63, targets are processed trail dots won’t appear behind any target as there aren’t enough available for more than 63 target formats.  *When activated, reported altitude (Mode C) numerics appear on the radar indicator next to the position symbol X for all beacon replies on the selected discrete code or within its rackets.  Although code and altitude coverage is from 1,000 feet up to 127,000 feet, altitude numerics range only from 1,000 feet to 99, 900 feet in 100-foot increments.  Altitude numerics are shown in three digits with zeros used where necessary.  "Minus" altitude is provided by display of a small horizontal minus sign ( - ) in place of the first (leftmost) altitude digit, which otherwise would be zero.  Aircraft  replying without Mode C, or with garbled or invalid Mode C replies, show a series of three slashes (///) instead of three digits.  If an aircraft has a valid Mode C reply, but is at or above 100,000 feet, the display consists of three dashes (- - -)  rather than altitude numerics.

Each   row consists of four thumbwheel switches with numeric   indicators that are used to select one to ten discrete identity  codes.  This feature allows discrete displays of ten different  a different mode.  To select a specific code, Rotate the  thumbwheel switches until the desired code appears in the  windows.  We have selected 0444 in the top row.                    codes at different radar indicators, either in the same mode or               *To the left of each row of Identity Filter switches are three     press switches labeled POSN (position), D (discrete ), and        CODE.  These switches are used to display the symbology/numerics desired for the selected code on the          radar indicator.  Discussion of these switches, and the         corresponding Identity Filter switches, is limited to the top       row as each succeeding row also performs the same         functions.

As a result, any aircraft answering that code bracket is marked with the select position symbol (X) on the radar scope.  The center of the X indicates the aircraft's true position.  For example, with code 0444 selected, when POSN is depressed, all aircraft squawking code 0400 through 0477 will be displayed as an X on the scope, because the radar indicator inspects only the first two digits of the code for a match.  *Activates the discrete feature of the indicator when the associated POSN switch is already activated.  When selected, the indicator rejects all replies that don't match all four digits of the selected code.  Symbo1ogies/numerics are displayed only on those replies that completely match the discrete code selection.  No other formats will be displayed with an X except specific forced target replies, which will be discussed later.  *Causes display of a four-digit code readout adjacent to the position symbol (X) of all beacon replies that match the first two digits of the selected code.  The code switch can only be activated if POSN is activated.                    NOTE:  A special identification pulse may be generated for display at your option.  On voice command to "IDENT" the pilot activates this ident feature, and the select aircraft position symbol (X) or all aircraft position symbol (O) is modified to show reception of a civil ident (I/P) reply on the radar indicator.  Position symbols will be enclosed in open circles with diameters that "shrink" from approximately 1/4 to 1/16 inch.  The "shrinking" circles give the impression of bouncing balls and are displayed for the duration of a complete scan each time an ident reply is received.  Replies are displayed for all selected aircraft or all aircraft targets.  14 CONTROL/INDICATOR  INTERROGATOR ON/OFF  INTRGOFFRANGEERROROVRDRF  PWRMAXRF  PWRLODEFRUITONLCL LCLIR / 1RMT RMTIR / 2APGU1         2AZERRORTARGETLOADNOBACKUP   DEFRUIT ON/OFF  INTRGOFFRANGEERROROVRDRF  PWRMAXRF  PWRLODEFRUITONLCL LCLIR / 1RMT RMTIR / 2  APGU1         2AZERRORTARGETLOADNOBACKUP When this button is depressed, power is turned on and the INTRG (interrogator) lamp illuminates green indicating that the AN/TPX-42A interrogator is transmitting.

Activates equipment which eliminates interference from the  secondary radar presentation.  In areas with large volumes of     of air traffic several interrogators may be operating near each    other, resulting in false returns and code garbling called fruit.    Activation of the defruit equipment effectively removes this    unwanted interference.  This button should be ON for normal    operation and will glow green.  NOTE:  When DEFRUIT ON glows green, it indicates only that DEFRUIT has been selected.  To ensure the control circuits are functioning, the DEFRUIT indicator on the A Box lights when the Interference Blanker (DEFRUIT) is functioning.  The green (DEFRUIT ON) and white (DEFRUIT ON) lights will switch when the button is depressed although the Interference Blanker may not react accordingly.  Enables the supervisor to override range error and permits    succeeding interrogations.  When range error is detected    (primary radar return and beacon reply don’t correspond),    RANGE ERROR glows red.  When this occurs, depress    RANGE ERROR/OVRD to activate override, or the beacon    system shuts down.  In OVERRIDE, RANGE ERROR flashes   red, while OVRD glows white indicating the shutdown circuit is overridden and noncoincidental video targets are displayed.   AT-E-07  JULY 04 B BOX (INTERROGATOR SET CONTROL)  This section describes the operational controls of the B box.  Figure 5 in the back of this guide shows a front panel view of this box.  Using Figure 5 and Table 2 below, associate the function of each control to its location.

The lower half, RMT, illuminates green to indicate facility control of the     interrogator at the B box.  The upper half, LOCAL, glows amber to indicate maintenance control of the interrogator.    NOTE:  When both RMT indicators glow green the facility B Box has control of the system.  When both LCL indicators   glow amber the maintenance site has control of the system.  When a split configuration is indicated (one RMT green and one LCL amber) neither site has complete control of the system.  Selects interrogator power output.  Most USAF facilities will   operate in the RF PWR LO (radio frequency power low) position.  When the RF PWR LO switch is depressed, the      indicator glows amber. RF PWR MAX (radio frequency         power maximum) position will normally be used only in      emergency conditions and glows green when selected. Selects either of the two IR (interrogator  /  receiver) units        and indicates which is on-line. Depress the reserve IR if          synthetic information is lost.  When IR/1 is selected, IR/2 is     in standby. When IR/2 is selected, IR/1 is in standby.  Either    the top or bottom half of the button glows green to indicate      the operational unit. *Selects either of the two Azimuth Pulse Generators, indicates which is on-line and also indicates detection of an AZ ERROR (azimuth error) in the processor.  During normal   operation, the on-line APGU (azimuth pulse generator unit) APGU 1 or 2 selector will glow green.  The off line APGU      is selected by depressing the APGU 1/2 selector switch.          When the processor detects that either numerics or symbology information being displayed on the radar indicator isn't in the proper azimuth, the bottom portion of the selector AZ ERROR glows red.  To correct this problem, immediately activate the standby APGU.  If the AZ ERROR light fails to go out, notify maintenance.   NOTE:  AZ ERROR will illuminate when the standby APGU is selected.  It normally will extinguish within one rotation of the antenna.  16AT-E-07  JULY 04  TARGET LOAD   /   NO BACKUP INTRGOFFRANGEERROROVRDRF  PWRMAXRF  PWRLODEFRUITONLCL LCLIR / 1RMT RMTIR / 2 APGU1         2AZERRORTARGETLOADNOBACKUP  RANGE  SELECT   /   LAMP  DIMMER    RANGE SELECT NM 10015060MAXThe top part of this status indicator, TARGET LOAD glows   amber when the beacon system attempts simultaneous display of more than 128 target formats on the radar indicator in any one scan.  When the 128 target maximum is exceeded, the interrogator eliminates, from the next scan, the target that has been in its memory bank the longest. This target will be           detected and displayed as a new format on the next successive   scan, and the next oldest targets will be eliminated for one         scan.  This procedure continues as long as maximum                  capability is exceeded.  Interval between erasure and                  refreshing is barely noticeable; as average time between scans   is only 4 seconds.  Reduction in range could eliminate this         condition, but automatic monitor capability would be lost           beyond that range.  The bottom part of the status indicator, NO BACKUP, indicates that only one interrogator  / receiver unit is available. This control consists of a dual function rotary dial used to select the operating range of the processor, and to control brightness of the panel lamps.  The outer portion of this dial controls the four range settings:  60 nm, 100 nm, 150 nm, and MAX (200nm).  It bears no relationship to the primary radar range selected at various indicators.  Normally, the range will be set for 60 nm to prevent computer overload (maximum of 128 targets).  Emergencies, hijacks, and communications failures beyond 60 nm will be forced through the system.  The inner portion of the dial will control panel illumination.  To increase lamp intensity, rotate the knob clockwise.

The numeric beacon decoder system uses this    information when converting Mode C data for display as   indicated altitude readout up to transition altitude.  To insure   accurate altitude readouts, it's essential settings be kept    current, as pressure changes will shift the pressure value of   each altitude reading a corresponding amount.  Altitude   readouts of aircraft at or above transition altitude are   automatically based on 29.92 inches of mercury and are  shown in flight levels rather than being corrected for   barometric settings.  Pilots may also correct altimeters to local pressure referenced by voice command from the controller, allowing the cockpit reading to correspond to the ground decoded display.                                                       This completes our discussion of the controls and functions of the A and B boxes.  As you can see, the simplicity of its design enables visual monitoring of major functions and, at a mere touch of a finger, operational control of the AN/TPX-42A indicator control (A box) and interrogator set control (B box).                                                             17AT-E-07  JULY 04 SECTION II  FAMILIZARATION AND DISPLAY INTERPRETATION OFF             100150             INTRGACTION  CONTROL  INDICATION          INTRG/OFF indicator (B  BOX) changes state  INTERR indicator on   the A box also changes                   state.

Proper operation and understanding of the system is essential.  The TPX-49A equipment is normally located in the radar equipment area.  Controllers have specific responsibilities for the operation of the TPX-49A during equipment checks and when operating in a secondary radar only environment.  Position of the TPX-49A target and frequency of equipment check must be outlined in facility directives.

REPLY SELECTOR: Six position switch to select the type of reply to be generated for an interrogation.                             in mode 2.                              5.  REPLY CODE: This group of twelve switches is divided into four subgroups designated A, B, C and D.  Each subgroup contains switches marked 1, 2, and 4.  These switches when selected to the IN position form a binary code equal to one digit of a IFF/SIF code in  the designated subgroup.  To set in a code of 1476 in the REPLY CODE section, set subgroup A switches(1 IN, 2 and 4 OUT); B switches (l and 2 OUT, 4 IN); C switches (1, 2 and 4 IN); D switches (l OUT, 2 and 4 IN).  The sum of the switch values selected to the IN position for each subgroup equals the value of the corresponding digit of the IFF/SIF code.  6.  RANGE DELAY: This set of seven switches determines the range at which the TPX-49A generated target will be displayed on the radar indicator.  Ranges can vary from 1/8 to 15 7/8 miles.  Range is determined by the sum of the value of the switches set to the IN position.  7.  TEST SELECTOR and TIME OPERATED: are maintenance functions/indicators.  f.  SPI: Outputs code 7777 in mode 2 and 3/A and the IDENT pulse. OPERATING  INSTRUCTIONS  1.  Turn TPX-49 system on (on/off switch).  2.  Check OPERATING MODE, select LOCAL.  3.  Set RANGE DELAY for proper range.  This is normally set by maintenance personnel and should not need to be changed.  4.  Set REPLY SELECTOR to desired function.  If NORMAL is selected, set desired code in CODE REPLY section.  5.  When system is no longer needed turn power switch off.  22AT-E-07  JULY 04 TARGET DISPLAY INTERPRETATION  1.  SIDE LOBE SUPRESSION (SLS) and REFLECTIONS: The TPX-42 system is designed to transmit SLS pulses to properly equipped aircraft that inhibits replies to antenna side lobes.  Aircraft transponders not equipped with SLS capabilities may respond to side lobe signals and be processed causing false target returns at the same range as the true target, but with varying azimuth positions.  This display of false targets is commonly referred to as ring-around and should not be confused with reflected targets.  Reflected targets generally appear from aircraft operating in the same general area and altitude and the reflected target can be displayed at any range or azimuth.  Neither of these undesirable effects are the fault of the TPX-42 system, but rather old style aircraft avionics and local topography.  2.  Figure 3 is a composite display of all possible display formats of the TPX-42 system.  This will help you recognize and interpret the various format symbology and numerics displayed.  3.  Figures 4 and 5 are graphic drawings of the TPX-42 "A" and "B" Boxes.  23AT-E-07  JULY 04                          7206122BRACKET VIDEO TARGETPRIMARY RADAR TARGETALL AIRCRAFT (NONSELECTED TARGET)SELECTED TARGETCODE NUMERICSALTITUDE NUMERICS IN100 FT INCREMENTSALTITUDE ABOVE 999ALTITUDE BRACKETS ONLY      (NO VALID MODE C)FORCED THRU TARGET(ALTITUDE LAYERING)TRAIL DOTSSPI / IP IDENT (ALL AIRCRAFT)SPI / IP IDENT (SELECTED TARGET) Figure 2.
