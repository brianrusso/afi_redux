General Issues.  This instruction: 1.1.1.  Applies to all MAJCOMs, ANG, Direct Reporting Units (DRU) and Field Operating Agencies (FOA). 1.1.2.  Defines  minimum  Levels  of  Formal  SERE  Training  and  SERE  Refresher  Training (SRT) requirements for United States Air Force (AF) personnel. 1.1.3.  Identifies  Personnel  Recovery  (PR)  operational  support  responsibilities  and  defines roles and duties of Air Force SERE Specialists (1T000/1T0X1) in support of PR. 1.1.4.  Defines roles and responsibilities for SERE Specialist career field management. 1.1.5.  Defines  procedures  for  standardization  and  evaluation  of  the  Air  Force  SERE Program. 1.2.  Program Explanation: 1.2.1.  The  Air  Force  SERE  Program  is  a  function  within  the  DoD  PR  enterprise.    The  Air Force SERE Program encompasses Formal SERE Training, SRT, and PR operational support required  to  enable  military,  civilian,  contractor,  and  other  designated  personnel  to  return  to friendly control after isolation due to enemy actions, aircraft emergency, or other unforeseen events.    The  AF  SERE  Program  supports  PR  through  education,  training,  and  operations support activities.  Specifically, the Universal Joint Task List, Air Force Universal Task List, Joint  Mission  Essential  Task  List  and  applicable  Air  Force  tasks  for  conducting  PR operations  drive  SERE  Program  requirements.    Doctrinally,  the  PR  system  is  comprised  of education  and  training,  mission  planning,  execution,  tracking,  debriefing,  reintegration,  and applying  applicable  lessons  learned.    The  SERE  Program  begins  and  closes  the  PR continuum  beginning  with  initial  SERE  training  and  culminating  with  reintegration  and adaptation. 1.2.2.  SERE Program Goals and Objectives. 1.2.2.1.  The  SERE  Program  provides  PR  preparation,  planning,  execution,  and adaptation to combatant commanders across the full spectrum of operations by applying SERE  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  (TTPs)  to  enable  Isolated  Personnel  (IP)  to survive and return with honor. 1.2.2.2.  Preparation  tasks  include  Formal  SERE  Training,  SRT  and  Continuation Training (CT).  The goal of SERE training is to prepare personnel to return with honor, regardless  of  the  circumstances  of  isolation.    SERE  Training,  SRT  and  CT  provide  an efficient and effective PR/SERE training continuum throughout the member's career. 1.2.2.2.1.  The  Code  of  Conduct  (CoC)  is  the  foundation  underpinning  the warfighter’s  PR/SERE  preparation  and  training.    AF  SERE  programs  must  prepare AF personnel for isolation across the range of military operations.  AFI16-1301  3 AUGUST 2017 5 1.2.2.3.  Planning  tasks  require  foundational  knowledge  of  the  DoD  PR  system  and  AF operational  structure  to  conduct  and  support  preparation  activities,  which  include  Pre-deployment  Site  Surveys,  PR  Site  Visits,  PR  Mission  Assessments  (PRA)  and  PR Mission Analysis (PRMA). 1.2.2.4.  Any  event  where  US  military,  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  civilians,  and DOD  contracted  employees  and  others  designated  by  the  President  or  Secretary  of Defense who are separated from their unit, as an individual or group, while participating in  a  US-sponsored  military  activity  or  mission  and  who  are,  or  may  be,  in  a  situation where they must survive, evade, resist,  or  escape triggers  a PR event  and the execution function.    SERE  Specialists  directly  support  the  report,  locate,  support,  recover  and reintegrate tasks of PR. 1.2.2.4.1.  The  AF  SERE  Program  must  provide  the  necessary  PR  support  to  AF personnel  at  risk  of  isolation  and/or  capture  prior  to  and  during  operations.    IP increase their chance of an expedient recovery and reduce risk to the recovery force when  they  are  trained  and  equipped  to  perform  PR/SERE  Multiservice  Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (MTTP). 1.2.2.5.  PR and SERE subject matter expertise enables collection of critical information during  exercises,  rehearsals,  PR  missions,  reintegration  activities  and  debriefs,  and contingency  SERE  debriefs.    These  documented  lessons  learned,  drive  adaptation  to  an ever-changing PR and SERE environment. 1.3.  Supplements and Waivers. 1.3.1.  MAJCOMs and ANG functional managers/SERE Program OPR will supplement this instruction  within  12  months  of  publication  and  forward  a  copy  of  the  supplement  to AF/A3TS.  (T-1)  Field units will forward their supplements to parent MAJCOM/DRU/FOA office  of  primary  responsibility  for  post  publication  review.    (T-3)    Note:    The  terms  DRU and FOA only refer to those DRUs/FOAs that report directly to HQ USAF.  (T-1) 1.3.2.  Waiver  authority  for  this  instruction  is  HQ  AF/A3TS  unless  otherwise  stated.  MAJCOMs, ANG, DRUs and FOAs may request waivers and/or deviations to requirements in  this  instruction  when  unique  or  unusual  circumstances  affect  the  unit’s  ability  to implement  stated  policy  or  procedure.    Wings/DRUs/FOAs  will  process  waivers  through their  respective  MAJCOM  or  ANG  authority  for  submission  to  HQ  AF/A3TS.

Successful execution of SERE Specialist missions requires a higher degree of physical fitness beginning with entry level training (S-V81-A) and continuing throughout a member’s career.    The  unique  SERE  mission  requires  optimum  individual  performance  in  areas  of adverse  terrain,  every  environmental  condition,  and  dive  and  airborne  operations.  These conditions  require  mental  and  physical  capabilities  be  maintained  at  a  higher  level.  Commanders  will  ensure  assigned  SERE  Specialists  complete  at  least  7.5  hours  of  fitness training weekly.  The SERE Physical  Fitness  Evaluation  supplements the Air Force Fitness standards to assess and maintain overall fitness levels.  (T-3) 42 AFI16-1301  3 AUGUST 2017 4.4.2.  SERE Specialists will be assessed annually.  The SPFT consists of push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups  and  2-mile  run.    Point  values  for  the  events  are  shown  in  Table  4.4.,  Physical Fitness  Evaluation  Criteria  minimum/maximum  scores  are  annotated  by  the  notes  in  Table 4.4.  Above the minimum score is considered Satisfactory.  Additionally, an alternate 4-mile ruck march or 500-meter swim may be used in lieu of the 2-mile run.  Points associated with the  4-mile  ruck  march  and  500-meter  swim  are  outlined  within  the  related  paragraph.  Calisthenics  events  will  be  tested,  one  immediately  after  the  other,  with  a  2-minute  rest between  events.    Upon  completion  of  all  calisthenics  events,  a  rest  of  approximately  10 minutes  is  given  prior  to  starting  the  2–mile  run,  4-mile  ruck  march  or  500-meter  swim.  Failure  of  any  event  by  not  meeting  the  standard  will  constitute  a  failure  of  the  entire  test.  (T-3)   AFI16-1301  3 AUGUST 2017 43 Table 4.4.  Physical Fitness Evaluation Criteria.

Minimum scores: Under 30 years old = 290; Under 40 years old = 255; Over 40 years old = 225  4.4.2.1.  Pull–ups  (time  limit:  2  minutes).    This  exercise  is  executed  on  a  pull–up  bar.  The  individual  grasps  the  bar  with  the  palms  away  from  the  face  about  shoulder  width apart.    This  is  a  two-count  exercise.    The  exercise  begins  in  the  “dead  hang”  position.  Count one, pull the body directly upward until the chin is over the bar.  Count two, lower 44 AFI16-1301  3 AUGUST 2017 the body until the body is again in the “dead hang” position.  Individuals will not swing excessively, kip or bicycle feet as the chin is pulled over the bar.  Repeat as many times as possible.  This exercise is designed to measure strength and endurance in the back and biceps muscles. 4.4.2.2.  Sit–ups (time limit: 2  minutes).  Start  with  the back flat  on the  ground,  fingers interlocked behind the head, head off the ground and knees bent at approximately a 90-degree angle.  Another individual may hold the feet during the exercise or a toe bar may be used.  This is a two-count exercise.  Count one, sit up until the back is vertical to the ground.  Count two, return to the starting position.  The only authorized rest position is when the back is vertical to the ground.  If an individual raises buttocks from ground or their  fingers  are  not  interlocked  behind  head  during  a  repetition,  the  repetition  is  not counted.  This exercise is designed to measure strength and endurance in abdominal and hip flexor muscle groups. 4.4.2.3.  Push-ups (time limit: 2 minutes).  This exercise starts from the front leaning rest position.  The body must be maintained straight from head to heels with knees together.  This  is  a  two-count  exercise.    Count  one,  flex  the  elbows,  lowering  the  body  until  the elbows form a 90-degree angle.  Count two, raise the body until the elbows are straight and  locked.    Repeat  this  exercise  as  many  times  as  possible.    Event  is  stopped  if  an individual touches a knee to the ground, removes a hand from the ground, or a foot leaves the  ground.    The  only  authorized  rest  position  is  the  starting  position.    This  exercise  is designed to measure the strength and endurance of the chest and triceps muscles. 4.4.2.4.  Two-Mile  Run.    This  is  performed  with  running  shoes  and  appropriate  athletic attire.  This event will be performed on flat, level, hard-surfaced terrain.  This exercise is designed to measure aerobic endurance. 4.4.2.5.  Failures  will  be  provided  the  opportunity  to  re-test.    These  guidelines  and procedures will be included in the MAJCOM supplements.  (T-2) 4.4.3.  Temporary Profiles.  A member with a temporary profile must take the regular four-event SPFT after the profile has expired.  Once the profile is lifted, the SERE Specialist must be given 90 days to train for the fitness test.  (T-3) 4.4.4.  Permanent  Profiles.  Members  who  have  been  given  a  permanent  profile  by  Air Force health professionals will be exempt from the SPFT.  If the condition allows member to serve in the AF, retention in the AFSC will be routed through SERE FAM to SERE CFM for final decision.  In the event that the member is returned to duty with no profile, he/she must take the SPFT within 90 days unless otherwise indicated in member's profile.  (T-1) 4.4.5.  Alternate Fitness Events: 4.4.5.1.  An alternate aerobic fitness test event is a 4-mile ruck march in lieu of the 2-mile run.    The  4-mile  ruck  march  will  be  conducted  on  flat  level  terrain  with  a  40-pound rucksack worn for the entire duration of the movement.  Successful completion of the 4-mile  ruck  march  with  40-pound  ruck  under  the  maximum  time  will  be  scored  at  120 points for the aerobic portion of the fitness test.  AFI16-1301  3 AUGUST 2017 45 4.4.5.2.  Additionally,  members  may  elect  to  perform  the  500-meter  swim  test  in  an indoor or outdoor pool.  Members may wear any swim goggle of their choice, but will not wear  fins  or  any  additional  equipment  to  enhance  performance.    The  entire  500  meters will  not  include  any  breaks  or  hanging  on  the  side  of  the  pool.    The  test  assesses  the aerobic fitness and muscular endurance of the individual.  Members may elect to perform the  swim  test  in  lieu  of  the  2-mile  run.    The  standards  for  the  alternate  swim  event  are listed in Table 4.5.  Satisfactory completion of the alternate swim event will be scored at 120 points. Table 4.5.  Alternate Testing Events.

A  robust  PR  exercise  program  is  imperative  for  preparing  the  warfighter  for prosecution of recovery across the spectrum of engagement.  A major part of training for the PR process  is  the specific "actions on the objective" or the  IP's role in  the overall recovery effort.  Currently, numerous Combatant Command and MAJCOM-directed PR exercises are in  place  to  allow  recovery  forces  to  execute  critical  personnel  recovery  Mission  Essential Tasks (MET), as well as providing potential IPs with an opportunity to practice evasion and recovery  skills  in  a  simulated  combat  environment  (e.g.,  Pacific  Thunder,  Red  Flag,  Angel Thunder,  Green  Flag-East  and  the  Joint  Readiness  Training  Center,  and  ACC/AFSOC Combat  Air  Force  (CAF)  integration  exercises).    These  exercises  provide  commanders  and staff,  planners,  aviation  and  ground  recovery  forces,  as  well  as  potential  IP  a  forum  for planning  and  executing  full-spectrum  PR  TTP.    Specifically,  the  SERE  role  within  this process is to provide mission-critical feedback and after action review from the "survivor's" perspective. 5.5.2.  Specific SERE responsibilities. 5.5.2.1.  Assists in development of exercise plans (EXPLANs), SPINs, PR CONOPs, etc.  (T-3) 5.5.2.2.

Performs  observer/controller  (escort)  duties include  data  collection, performance feedback, safety, and emergency field medical treatment, as required.  (T-3) to 5.5.2.4.  Coordinates and performs airborne operations, as required.  (T-3) 5.5.3.  Incorporating  summary  of  PR  exercise  lessons  learned  and  after  action  into  both  the formal and continuation processes is essential to successful PR.  MAJCOMs conducting PR exercises will forward sanitized lessons learned and other PR-related after action items to HQ AF/A3TS for review and distribution to the field.  Use the "observation, analysis, and lessons learned" format for collecting and disseminating data. 5.5.3.1.  HQ  AETC/A3ZS  will  ensure  applicable  data  is  incorporated  into  the  formal training process.  (T-2) 5.5.3.2.  SERE FAMs for commands with Mission Ready (MR)/Combat  Mission Ready (CMR) personnel and personnel assigned to combat-coded units will ensure appropriate lessons learned are distributed to subordinate units for inclusion in SRT programs.  (T-3)   48 AFI16-1301  3 AUGUST 2017 5.6.  Personnel Recovery Operational Support 5.6.1.  Personnel Recovery Operational Support may be assessed via local SERE events and larger  installation  exercises.    PR  support  activities  should  evaluate  actions  taken  to  prepare at-risk personnel,  develop evasion  plans of action, support recovery execution, and conduct reintegration debriefings to adapt recovery planning to the variables of the conflict.  (T-3) 5.7.  Post Training Exercises (PTE). 5.7.1.  MAJCOMs  may  conduct  PTEs  to  evaluate  CAC  program  effectiveness.    PTE Participants must be Level B or C graduates.  (T-2) 5.7.2.  MAJCOM requests for JPRA led PTEs will be coordinated through AF/A3TS.  Once approved,  requesting  unit  will  coordinate  directly  with  JPRA  keeping  MAJCOM  and  HAF POC’s informed until PTE is complete.  (T-2) 5.7.3.  MAJCOM  requests  to  conduct  independent  PTEs  will  be  coordinated  with  and approved by AF/A3TS.  Requests must include the following items: Justification for training; type  of  training;  desired  learning  outcome;  length  of  training;  instructor  qualifications;  risk management; and support requirements.  (T-2) 5.7.3.1.  Requesting unit will forward lessons-learned/after-action reports to the assessed unit  Commander  and  AF/A3TS.    AF/A3TS  will  forward  to  lessons-learned/after-action JPRA and courtesy copy appropriate MAJCOM.  (T-1) 5.7.4.  PTEs involving two or more services or components must be approved separately by the PR OPR for each service or component involved.  The requesting unit, if Air Force, will ensure the supporting service or component PR OPRs are included in the staffing process to ensure all parties are informed and sufficient coordination is completed.

The  SERE  mission  area  often  places  personnel  in  remote  environments  and  potentially hazardous  situations.    Conditions  often  include  austere  operating  locations,  inclement  weather, rugged terrain, hazardous life forms, and fixed/rotary-wing operations.  While operations within the  SERE  mission  area  are  objective  driven,  it  is  imperative  all  SERE  missions  begin  with  a thorough  risk  assessment  IAW  the  six  step  risk management  processes  outlined  in  AFI  90-802 and AFPAM 90-803.  While it is hard to identify all potential contingencies during an operation, proper  planning  will  enhance  overall  individual  safety  during  high-risk  training.    Risk management  must  assess  the  risk,  weigh  associated  factors,  and  posture  for  as  many contingencies  as  possible  within  a  given  operation.    Ensure  command  involvement  in  the decision  making  process.    Regardless  of  the  mission,  risk  management  must  include bioenvironmental, equipment, communication, location, and medical considerations.  (T-3) A6.1.1.  Specifically, SERE operations and training activities should include all AFI 90-802 requirements plus: A6.1.1.1.  Bioenvironmental A6.1.1.1.1.  Weather A6.1.1.1.2.  Terrain A6.1.1.1.3.  Animal life A6.1.1.1.4.  Plant life A6.1.1.1.5.  Socio-political A6.1.1.2.  Equipment A6.1.1.2.1.  Vehicles A6.1.1.2.2.  Personal protective A6.1.1.3.  Communication A6.1.1.3.1.  Mobile radios A6.1.1.3.2.  Telephone A6.1.1.3.3.  Air to ground visual signals A6.1.1.4.  Assistance required date and time A6.1.1.4.1.  Rear support element A6.1.1.5.  Location A6.1.1.6.  Medical A6.1.1.6.1.  Minor A6.1.1.6.2.  Major A6.1.1.6.3.  Evacuation plans AFI16-1301  3 AUGUST 2017 63 A6.1.1.6.4.  Location,  directions,  and  contact  procedures  for  emergency  care facilities. A6.1.2.  The  SERE  Program  approach  to  RM  should  consider  “what  exists,  what  is  the impact,  and  what  is  the  plan”  for  each  factor.    Incorporating  these  considerations  into  RM programs  will  ensure  overall  standardization,  reduce  instability  within  the  planning processes,  and  ensure  SERE  operations  are  conducted  in  a  safe  manner,  regardless  of  the operating environment. A6.1.3.  The  following  RM  checklists/matrixes  may  be  applied  to  SERE  operations  and training activities in order to assist in the safe prosecution of the SERE mission.  However, it must be understood that mere "numbers" should never be a substitute for sound judgment and decision-  making.    The  more  complex  and  hazardous  the  operation,  the  more  detailed  the mission  planning  must  be.    Units  will  develop  matrixes  specifically  tailored  to  their individual operational requirements. A6.1.4.  Water survival training operations, particularly when conducted in “open water” or when  utilizing  compressed  air,  pose  a  variety  of  unique  risks  that  must  be  accounted  for. MAJCOMs  will  ensure  units  develop  detailed  operating  instructions/plans  of  instruction (OIs/POIs)  to  ensure  overall  objective  accomplishment  and  RM.    Procedures  must  include location  of  decompression  chambers  and  chamber  access  procedures  for  units  conducting HEEDS/compressed  air  training.    The  following  outlines  specific  SERE  Specialist/support element requirements when conducting water survival training operations:  (T-2) A6.1.4.1.  Certified  Lifeguard  or  Para  Rescue  or  Navy/Coast  Guard  rescue  swimmer  on site for entire iteration of that session of WST, but they cannot be there as a student at the same time.  (T-2) A6.1.4.2.  CPR  qualified  instructors  or  support  personnel  on  site  for  duration  of  entire iteration of that session of WST.  (T-2) A6.1.4.3.  Units  are  encouraged  to  conduct  training  operations  in  an  open  water environment. Additional requirements for open water operations are as follows: A6.1.4.3.1.  All  participants  to  include  instructors  will  be  equipped  with  adequate flotation and spare flotation will be positioned aboard vessel.  (T-2) A6.1.4.3.2.  Ensure adequate medical coverage is available.  (T-2) A6.1.4.3.3.  If  needed  to  conduct  open  water  operations,  SERE  Specialists  will  be trained and certified on personal water craft (PWC), power boats and/or other vessels.  Personnel  will  complete  boating  safety  course  and/or  United  States  Coast  Guard boating safety course. A6.1.4.4.  Rotary-wing  requirements.    In  addition  to  environmental  factors,  medical considerations,  recovery  TTP,  etc.  training  for  rotary-wing/tilt  rotor  crewmembers  will also include “hands-on” application of an approved Helicopter Emergency Egress Device (HEED) for assigned aircrews.  Additionally, units will utilize the Shallow Water Egress Trainer  (SWET)  as  a  method  of  reinforcing  “hard  skill”  requirements  associated  with underwater egress.  When conducting hands on breathing device and SWET operations, the OIs/POI will also include the following additional requirements:  (T-2) 64 AFI16-1301  3 AUGUST 2017 A6.1.4.4.1.  SERE  Specialists  conducting thorough understanding of dive physiology.  Personnel may receive this training either through basic civilian dive courses, military dive certification, or through in-unit continuation training.  (T-2) require  a this training A6.1.4.4.2.  To  ensure  aircrew  safety,  HEED  and/or  SWET  training  must  be conducted  in  a  controlled  environment,  i.e.,  swimming  pool.    Depth  for  personnel utilizing the approved devices will not exceed 4 feet.  (T-1) A6.1.4.4.3.  SWET.  As a minimum, training objectives should require participants to clear the HEED under water using both approved techniques (IAW US Navy HEED video  maintained  on  the  GA/SERE  SharePoint  site)  and  breath  successfully  under water,  maintain  reference  point,  release,  and  effectively  egress  the  SWET. Participants  will  be  required  to  demonstrate  proficiency  with  the  HEED  prior  to entering the SWET.  (T-2) A6.1.5.  The  matrixes  identify  basic  concepts  needed  for  consideration  when  conducting water survival training.  These concepts apply when conducting operations in both open and protected waters.  AFI16-1301  3 AUGUST 2017 65 Attachment 7 PERSONNEL RECOVERY EXERCISE AND OPERATIONAL SUPPORT A7.1.

Personnel  Recovery  Kits (PRK) or equipment,  provide High-Risk-of- Isolation (HRI) personnel  with  essential  equipment,  tools  and  items  necessary  for  successful  survival,  evasion, resistance,  and  escape  in  a  specific  non-permissive  environments/area  of  responsibility  (AOR). They  are  designed  to  supplement/augment  AF  issued  Survival  vest/kits,  which  are  of  a  global nature.    All  items  should  support  the  Combatant  Commander's  PR  plan  and  theater  PR capabilities.    PRKs  should  be  issued  from  home  station  and  tailored  to  specific  units  and missions when possible. A8.1.1.  Coordinate  unit's  PRK  requirements  through  the  chain  of  command  to  respective SERE  FAMs  prior  to  acquisition.    To  ensure  unity  of  effort,  uniformity,  life  cycle,  and supportability  of  kit  items  SERE  FAMs  will  coordinate  with  theater  recovery  coordination centers (i.e., JPRC, PRCC, Air Operations Center (AOC), etc.) to ensure interoperability and feasibility of PRK items into PR JTTP. A8.1.2.  SERE  SMEs  are  responsible  for  recommending  items,  containers,  employment methods and conducting necessary PRK training events. A8.1.3.  HRI  personnel  should  employ  PRKs  during  SRT  events  and  PR  exercises  and become  familiar  with  the  items.    They  must  possess  a  thorough  understanding  of  effective tactics,  techniques  and  procedures  for  their  employment,  zeroization,  destruction,  and  care and use while under field conditions. A8.1.4.  Include PRK items as part of the individuals Evasion Plan of Action.  In the event of a recovery effort, PRK information for missing personnel must be quickly passed by a secure means to the servicing recovery center. A8.1.5.  PRKs  should  address  basic  needs  and  support  the  PR  execution  tasks  of  report, locate,  and  recover.    PRKs  should,  as  a  minimum,  contain  Evasion  Charts  (EVC)  or equivalent  map  of  operations  area,  small  nighttime  signaling  devices,  Blood  Chit,  and Pointee-Talkees of the Area of Operations. A8.1.6.  Additional  PRK  items  should  address  the  specific  needs  required  for  successful evasion in a specified area of responsibility (AOR) and enhance the IP's ability to navigate, signal, hide, survive, and facilitate recovery. A8.1.7.  The  specific  size  and  placement  of  the  PRK  on  personnel  should  be  closely scrutinized and tailored to mission, platform, egress procedures, and need.  If worn/placed on personnel equipped with ejection seats, ensure the PRK does not impose a windblast hazard.  Contact local  Safety  Office  and  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  Officer  or  AFE Superintendent  if  there  are  safety  of  flight  concerns.    If  safety  is  in  doubt,  utilize  standard safe  to  fly  testing  and  evaluation  processes.    AFMC's  Test  Parachutist  Program  (TPP)  at Edwards AFB, CA, and the 311th Human Systems Wing, Brooks AFB, TX should evaluate PRKs for impact of emergency the
