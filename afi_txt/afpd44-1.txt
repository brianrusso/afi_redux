Major changes include the addition of Medical Stability Operations policy, DoDI 1010.09, and deletion of Attachment 2-Measuring Compliance with Policy. 1.  Policy.  The AFMS will employ strategic goals of “Readiness, Better Health, Better Care, and Best  Value”  and  “Trusted  Care”  to  optimize  population  based  healthcare,  evidence-based medicine,  patient  safety,  and  quality  patient  care.    The  AFMS  will  continue  to  transform deployable  medical  and  aeromedical  en-route  care  capabilities  for  rapid  response  to  any contingency and invest in education, training and research to sustain AFMS capabilities. 1.1.  The  AFMS  will  ensure  it  has  qualified  and  trained  medical  personnel  to  meet  any contingency  through  AFMS  Comprehensive  Medical  Readiness  Program.    This  program  is built on three interlinking processes:  clinical currency, Air Force Specialty Code Readiness and Unit Type Code training. 1.2.  Air  Force  Medical  Home  teams  and  Specialty  Care  Services  will  provide  appropriate clinical and preventive health services to our Service members and all beneficiaries to ensure our  supported  population  is  the  healthiest  and  highest  performing  segment  of  the  United States. 1.3.  Graduate Medical Education (GME) will provide the academic foundation for military medical education, research, and leadership development. 1.4.  Clinical Performance Improvement activities remain a vital part of these efforts and will be  supported  by  the  use  of  objective  measurements  and  by  the  results  of  nationally recognized surveyors. 1.5.  The  AFMS  promotes  a  drug-free  workplace  program  through  implementation  of education and testing procedures. 2.  Responsibilities. 2.1.  The  Air  Force  Surgeon  General  (AF/SG)  develops  all  policies  concerning  medical operations. 2.1.1.  The  Air  Force  Surgeon  General  ensures  MSO  capabilities  by  providing  medical personnel  the  required  resources  to  perform  this  mission  in  a  joint  environment  and ensure future development and acquisition programs are coordinated through the Surgeon General’s Requirements for Operational Capabilities Council (SGROCC), in accordance with AFI 10-601, Operational Capability Requirements Development, and the SGROCC Charter. 2.2.  The  Air  Force  Medical  Operations  Agency  (AFMOA),  as  a  vital  link  between  the AF/SG and MAJCOMs shall: 2.2.1.  Direct  clinical  activities  necessary  to  meet  the  requirements  of  congressionally mandated DoD health care benefits entitlements. 2.2.2.  Direct clinical quality improvement and risk management programs. 2.2.3.

Develop enterprise-wide mechanisms to monitor AF MTF performance in clinical and business operations to maximize mission effectiveness and support AF and Defense Health Agency (DHA) strategic direction. 2.3.  Major Command Surgeons enforce these policies, monitor performance, with a focus on ensuring  the  readiness  and  operational  mission  is  met.
