Maintenance of Real Property Records. 3.6.1.  The RPAO must ensure the accuracy and completeness of the real property records for all  real  property  in  accordance  with  DoDI  4165.70,  until  the  Air  Force  has  relinquished  all legal  interest  in  the  real  property  assets.    After  relinquishment  of  the  Air  Force’s  legal interest,  all  RPI  records  for  these  assets  and  sites  are  archived  in  accordance  with  section 090202, chapter 9 of Volume 1 of DoD 7000.14-R and Air Force Instruction 33-360 records management manuals. (T-0) 3.6.2.  Records  and  supporting  documentation  are  maintained  in  accordance  with  AFMAN 33-363. (T-1) AFI32-9005  4 MARCH 2015   11  Chapter 4 REAL PROPERTY INSTALLED EQUIPMENT (RPIE) 4.1.  RPIE.  Those  items  of  government-owned  or  leased  accessory  equipment,  apparatus  and fixtures  that  is  essential  to  the  function  of  the  facility.  Excluded  is  organizational  or  collateral equipment  reflected  in  the  equipment  authorization  inventory  data  (EAID).  Items  that  are  on  a Table of Allowance are not RPIE, but EAID through Base Supply. 4.2.  Other  Exclusions.  Also  excluded  are  other  technical,  medical,  commissary,  aircraft installed,  fixed  laundry  and  dry  cleaning,  MARS,  cryptographic,  automatic  data  processing, rental equipment, research and development, communications equipment. 4.3.  References. 4.3.1.  Reference  Attachment  2,  Table  A2.1,  for  examples  of  property  that  meet  the definition of “RPIE.” The list is not comprehensive but examples of ‘types’ of property that meet the RPIE definition. 4.3.2.  Reference  Attachment  3,  Table  A3.1,  for  examples  of  Non-RPIE  items.  The property listed does not meet the criteria for RPIE. The list is not all-inclusive. 4.4.  Additional  Considerations.  Items  which  would  normally  be  funded  as  construction (construction  pads,  foundations,  supporting  utilities,  facilities,  fences  etc.)  become  RPIE regardless  of  initial  fund  source.  Maintenance,  repair  and  replacement  funding  of  all  real property  is  the  responsibility  of  the  BCE.  (T-1)  Modification  of  the  real  property  is  funded  as repair equipment modification/replacement  program  (e.g.  sound  suppression  equipment  replace)  done  as  a  turn-key procurement in accordance with para 8.19, Air Force Instruction 65-601 Volume 1. (T-1) construction subsequent included unless or as part of a 4.5.  Relocatable Buildings.  By definition, are used to fulfill a temporary requirement (less than five  years).    A  structure  physically  capable  of  being  moved  does  not  alone  qualify  it  as  a “relocatable building”.  See AFI 32-1021, Ch. 6; AFI 32-1032, Paragraph 3.5.9.,  Planning and Programming  Appropriated  Fund  Maintenance,  Repair,  and  Construction  Projects;  and  DoDI 4165.56,  Relocatable  Buildings,  for  further  guidance,  including  fire,  safety,  and  antiterrorism requirements.  Current  DoD and Air Force policy is  to  keep temporary  facilities to  an absolute minimum;  as  short-term  as  possible,  and  only  in  use  until  the  permanent  facility  is  built  or  no longer  requires  their  use.  (T-0)    Relocatable  buildings  may  be  acquired  as  personal  property (equipment) or real property.  When converting equipment-procured temporary facilities to real property the BCE shall secure SAF/IEE approval.  (T-1)  JUDITH A.

Facility—A building, structure, or linear structure whose footprint extends to an imaginary line surrounding a facility at a distance of 5 feet from the foundation that, barring specific direction to the contrary such as a utility privatization agreement, denotes what is included in the basic record for  the  facility  (e.g.,  landscaping,  sidewalks,  utility  connections).    This  imaginary  line  is commonly  referred  to  as  the  “5-foot  line.”    A  facility  will  have  an  RPUID  received  from  the RPUIR and is entered into a Service RPI system as a unique real property record. Functional  Business  Governance  Board  (FBGB)—An  authoritative  governance  body supporting  the  DUSD  (I&E)  in  carrying  out  the  functional  responsibilities  and  authorities assigned to the Department in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, and documented in both  the  Defense  Installations  Strategic  Plan  and  the  I&E  Functional  Business  Strategy.

The FYDP arrays cost data, manpower, and force structure over a 6-year period (force structure for an additional 3 years), portraying this data by major force program for DoD internal review for the program  and budget  review submission.    It  is also  provided to  the Congress  in  conjunction with the President’s budget. AFI32-9005  4 MARCH 2015   17  Geospatial  feature—An  abstraction  of  a  real-world  phenomenon  that  physically  places  the phenomenon, via an implicit or explicit reference, to a specific location relative to the Earth. This information  must  be  accompanied  by  the  applicable  coordinate  reference  system,  as  defined  in the geospatial standards  maintained by the  International  Organization for  Standardization. Real property  geospatial  features  are  typically  expressed  as  a  point,  line,  or  polygon.    Commonly known as geographic information system data. Geospatial location—An expression (see geospatial feature) of where a real-world phenomenon exists,  relative  to  the  Earth.    All  real  property  assets  have  a  geospatial  location;  data  which represent  real-world  phenomena  are  not  complete  without  a  correct  expression  of  geospatial location. Historic Status—The status of a facility with respect to the National Register of Historic Places. Installed Building Equipment (IBE)—Synonymous with RPIE. Installation—A base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, including any leased facility, which is located within any of the States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American  Samoa,  the  Virgin  Islands,  the  Commonwealth  of  the  Northern  Mariana  Islands,  or Guam.  Such term does not include any facility used primarily for civil works, rivers and harbors projects, or flood control projects.  In the case of an activity in a foreign country, an installation is any property under the operational control of the Secretary of a MILDEP or the Secretary of Defense, without regard to the duration of operational control.  For real property accountability, an installation must consist of one or more real property sites. Interest—The type and extent of ownership of property or for the use of property, including an easement  to  pass  over  an  adjacent  parcel,  mineral  rights,  outright  title,  or  a  possibility  of acquiring title should a specified event occur.

Land  parcel—A  real  property  asset  identified  as  a  specific  area  of  land  having  a  unique acquisition document and a legal description of its boundaries and whose perimeter is delineated by  a  cadastral  survey,  as  recorded  in  the  land  records  of  the  government  entity  having appropriate jurisdiction.   18  AFI32-9005  4 MARCH 2015 Linear  structure—A  facility  whose  function  requires  that  it  traverse  land  (e.g.,  runway,  road, rail  line,  pipeline,  fence,  pavement,  electrical  distribution  line)  or  is  otherwise  managed  or reported by a linear UM at the CATCODE level. Portable  Structure—A  building  or  structure  (except  vehicular  equipment)  designed  to  be moved intact from one location to another. Portable structures are not accounted for as RP. Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):  —Tangible assets that: (1) have an estimated useful life of 2 or more years,  (2) are not intended for sale in the ordinary course of business, and  (3) have been acquired or constructed with the intention of being used, or being available for use by the DoD.  There are three PP&E categories:  (1) General PP&E (including land acquired for or in connection with other general PP&E). (2) heritage assets; and  (3) stewardship land.  General PP&E will be disclosed on the financial statements in the General PP&E account when the cost of the asset exceeds the capitalization threshold established for the DoD. General PP&E includes  assets  acquired  through  capital  lease  and  land  acquired  for  or  in  connection  with  other general PP&E. Primary Installation—A self-supporting installation, with or without an aircraft operating area that has facilities for  administrative and operational  activities to  carry out  a given mission. For recording and reporting RP, this is normally the parent or host installation. Programmed  Installation—An  installation  for  which  the  Air  Force  does  not  have  RP jurisdiction,  control,  or  accountability  but  that  an  Air  Force  organization  occupies  or  programs for  use.  The  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  assign  such  installations  their  programmed  installation indicators. Public  Domain—Land  originally  acquired  by  the  United  States  that  has  never  left  U.  S. ownership. The Department of the Interior (Bureau of Land Management) administers it. Purchase By fee simple acquisition.

An  updated  table  of  FAC  and CATCODES is published at least annually. Real  Property  Inventory  (RPI)—A  detailed  record  (listing,  system)  of  real  property  lands, buildings, structures, and linear structures. AFI32-9005  4 MARCH 2015   19  Real  Property  Installed  Equipment  (RPIE)—An  item  of  equipment  that  is  affixed  and  built into  a  facility  as  an  integral  part  of  that  facility.  To  qualify  as  RPIE,  the  equipment  must  be necessary  to  make  the  facility  complete,  and  if  removed,  would  destroy  or  severely  reduce  the designed  usefulness  and  operation  of  the  facility.  RPIE  costs  are  included  as  a  funded  initial construction or renovation cost.  RPIE may be accounted for as a real  property equipment  asset record, but  not  as a separate facility record in  the real  property inventory.  RPIE includes such items  as  control  systems,  heating,  cooling,  electrical,  emergency  lighting,  etc.,  and  is synonymous with IBE. Relocatable Structure— A habitable prefabricated structure that is designed and constructed to be  readily  moved  (transportable  over  public  roads),  erected,  disassembled,  stored,  and  reused. Also included in the definition are tension fabric structures assembled from modular components and air supported domes, both of which can be easily disassembled, moved, and reused. For the purpose  of  this  Instruction,  this  definition  excludes  mobile  military  equipment  such  as communications  vans,  emergency  management  and  command  post  trailers.  Also  excluded  are tents,  modular  sheds  less  than  500  square  feet,  temporary  contractor  trailers,  and  temporary government  construction  administration  trailers  that  are  located  on  or  in  the  vicinity  of  a construction site. Real  Property  Unique  Identifier  (RPUID)—A  non-intelligent  code  used  to  permanently  and uniquely identify a DoD real property asset. Real Property Site Unique Identifier (RPSUID)—A non-intelligent code used to permanently and uniquely identify a DoD real property site. Site—Physical (geographic) location that is, or was owned by, leased to, or otherwise possessed by a DoD Component on behalf of the United States.  Each site (except for leased) is assigned to a single installation.  A site may exist in one of three forms: 1.  Land only, where there are no facilities present and where the land consists of either a single land parcel or two or more contiguous land parcels. Facility or facilities only, where the underlying land is neither owned nor controlled by the government.  A stand—alone facility can be a site.  If a facility is not a stand-alone facility, it must be assigned to a site. 2.  Land,  and  all  the  facilities  thereon,  where  the  land  consists  of  either  a  single  land parcel or two or more contiguous land parcels. Stewardship PP&E—Property owned by the Federal Government and meeting the definition of one of the following: Heritage  Assets— property, plan, and equipment of historical, natural, cultural, educational, or artistic significance. Stewardship  Land—land  other  than  that  acquired  for  or  in  connection  with  general  PP&E. Stewardship  PP&E  is  expensed  and  has  no  book  value.  (Stewardship  PP&E  is  presented  in  a stewardship  statement  and  includes  those  items  whose  physical  properties  resemble  general PP&E but whose value in terms of dollars: (1) may be indeterminate or  (2) would have little meaning (e.g., museum collections and monuments), or whose cost  cannot  be  allocated  meaningfully  to  accounting  periods  (e.g.,  military   20  AFI32-9005  4 MARCH 2015 avionics  and  weapons  systems  and  space  exploration  assets).  Stewardship PP&E includes stewardship land, heritage assets, and federal mission PP&E. Structure—A facility, other than a building or linear structure, that is  constructed on or in  the land. Surplus Real Property—Real property that GSA has screened through all federal agencies and officially determined as not needed by the Federal Government. System of Record—The current system used by civil engineering personnel to account for and manage Air Force assets.  It is the original ‘book of  entry’ for financial accounting in terms of original acquisition cost and cost of any major improvements over the statutory threshold under the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. Temporary Construction—A facility suitable and appropriate to fill a need for a short period of time (5 years or less). Tenant—An organization or other entity occupying Air Force RP. Tenant Code—Used to denote an organization or tenant on the base Transfer  of  Accountability—The  transfer  of  accountability  of  all  assigned  RP  from  one accountable officer to another. Transfer—Real  estate  action  that  conveys  the  custody  and  control  of  RP  and  its  related  RPIE from one Air Force activity to another or to another military department or federal agency. Useful Life—See "Estimated Useful Life.” Utility—A distribution system, commodity source, or commodity collection point that provides a common service or commodity to more than one building or structure. Withdrawn Land—Public land set aside or designated for a specific public purpose, such as a national park, wildlife refuge or national defense use. Withdrawal of public lands generally has the  effect  of  segregating  such  land  from  lease,  sale,  settlement  or  other  disposition  under  the public land laws. The Air Force reports all withdrawn land as a Stewardship Asset on its annual Financial Report.  AFI32-9005  4 MARCH 2015   21  Attachment 2 RPIE RPIE Definition. RPIE is permanently attached RP generally installed as a part of a construction project, that cannot be removed from the structure without physically damaging the structure and without which the facility (structure) would be unable to operate as designed. When RPIE is changed (updated, replaced, fixed), the appropriate ACES record should be updated to reflect the new capacity and date of installation.   RPIE Sustainment. Real Property assets generate sustainment funding through models overseen by the DUSD (I&E) and in accordance with the DODD Unified Facilities Pricing (UFC 3-701-04) Guide.  These models use the RPI to develop programmatic goals that underpin facilities’ plant replacement value (PRV). A facility component must qualify as RPIE before it is considered for inclusion in the models. A tri-service facility sustainment working group reviews all requirements periodically to add cost factors of new RPIE components to the model. Unless approved for inclusion, the component will not earn sustainment funding for the equipment. Therefore, life cycle costs associated with non-RPIE components cannot be funded from these accounts. The using organization is responsible to budget and fund the acquisition, maintenance, repair, and replacement of non-RPIE items.  RPIE Maintained by Contractors. In rare instances, the activity or contractor may retain accountability (and fiscal responsibility) for installed property (i.e., an HVAC system with a 20-year service contract). AF and the requesting activity will execute a license or memorandum of understanding to the contractor to enable him or her to perform the required maintenance and have access to the equipment. The BCE will not fund maintenance of the equipment because the contractor is or has been paid and it does not generate sustainment funding otherwise.  RPIE in Foreign Countries. Title to all U.S. Government-constructed facilities plus any installed equipment in foreign countries remains U.S. Government property, unless agreements state otherwise.  Record only the following in the Inventory: (a) Direct expenditures by military departments from DoD construction and capital improvements appropriations, and (b) Direct investments of U.S. dollars (NAF or donations).

Maintenance, repair and replacement funding of all real property is the responsibility of the BCE. Modification of the real property is funded as construction unless included as part of a subsequent equipment modification/replacement program (e.g. sound suppression equipment replace) done as a turn-key procurement in accordance with para 8.19, AFI 65-601 Vol 1. 4. The temporary facility-use (re-locatable) authority was a concession from Congress to provide DoD a way to satisfy (for very short periods with unsubstantial buildings) requirements that were so urgent they could not wait for normal processes to obtain construction. Over time, temporary structures were erected that were more like permanent facilities than austere, relocatable structures. Current DoD and AF policy is to keep temporary facilities to an absolute minimum;   34  AFI32-9005  4 MARCH 2015 as short-term as possible, and only in use until the permanent facility is built or the mission no longer requires their use.
