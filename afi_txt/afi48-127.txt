Overview. 1.1.  The USAF HCP is a component of the Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH) Program, and is a command-driven program designed to reduce or eliminate hazardous noise exposure to workers and protect workers from the harmful effects of hazardous noise, while enhancing combat and operational capabilities.  This process must occur across the full life cycle  of  acquisition,  sustainment,  and  support  for  weapons  systems,  munitions  and  other materiel systems.  This requires identifying all areas where workers are exposed to hazardous noise  and  reducing  exposure  through  engineering  or  administrative  controls,  or  personal protective  equipment  (PPE).    (Also,  refer  to  AFI  91-203,  Air  Force  Consolidated Occupational  Safety  Instruction).    One  key  to  accomplishing  these  goals  is  an  education program  that  explains  the  individual’s  role  in  protecting  their  hearing  to  include  hazardous noise exposures on and off duty and how to mitigate those threats.   1.2.  DoDI  6055.12  requires  all  DoD  Components  to  implement  a  comprehensive  program and  written  plan  for  hearing  conservation  when  personnel  are  occupationally  exposed  as described  in  DoDI  6055.12.    This  instruction  meets  the  intent  and  requirements  of  DoDI 6055.12 and reflects the unique functions, capabilities, and procedures of the Air Force HCP. 1.3.  For  Joint  Bases,  this  instruction  is  followed  unless  specific  processes  and  provisions, meeting  the  intent  and  requirements  of  OSHA  and  DoDI  6055.12,  are  detailed  in  the Memorandum of Agreement. 1.4.  IAW  AFI  48-145,  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  Program,  hearing conservation  issues  will be  considered  through  the  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health Working Group (OEHWG) just as any other occupational exposure. 1.5.  HCP  requirements  should  be  covered  with  other  OEH  program  responsibilities  in memorandums of agreement as discussed in AFI 48-145. 1.6.  This  AFI  does  not  encompass  audiograms  for  new  accessions  (officer  and  enlisted), conducted by the Department of Defense Hearing Center of Excellence. 4 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 2.

For  potentially  hazardous  noise areas, signs will be located at their entrances or boundaries, including pathways leading to hazardous noise areas.  Reference Attachment  2.1.3for more information. 2.12.3.1.  Maintain  a  supply  of  approved  hearing  protection  devices  (HPDs)  along pathways leading to hazardous noise areas or equipment (T-0). 2.12.3.2.  Ensure  personnel  carry  hearing  protectors  with  them  when  working  in  or entering designated "hazardous noise areas" and wear their hearing protection devices when noise sources are operating, regardless of exposure time. (T-0).  This includes visitors,  temporary  or  transient  personnel  (i.e.,  repair  technicians),  aircrew,  and ground based controllers entering hazardous noise areas. 2.12.3.3.  In consultation with BE, ensure each tool or piece of equipment producing noise levels greater than or equal to 85 dBA, including vehicles, is clearly marked to alert  personnel  of  the  potential  hazard  (T-0).    Exception:    When  an  entire  space  is designated  a  "hazardous  noise  area,"  and  the  equipment  is  stationary.    In  addition, exteriors of military combatant equipment are excluded from this requirement.   2.12.4.  Notify  BE/PH  personnel  within  3  calendar  days  for  a  follow-up  BE  noise  level survey  if  workplace  equipment,  or  practices  and  procedures  involving  potentially hazardous  noise  change  (T-2).

Conduct  reference and pre-placement  audiograms,  and document  on DD Form 2215 IAW the following (T-0): AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 17 2.20.10.1.  All civilian personnel being considered for employment in an occupational specialty  or  area  that  involves  exposure  to  hazardous  noise  will  receive  a  reference audiogram,  prior  to  but  as  close  as  possible  to  the  actual  date  of  anticipated  noise exposure, at no cost to the employee (5 CFR 339.303 & 339.304; 29 CFR 1910.95) (T-0).    Military  personnel  exposed  to  hazardous  noise  will  receive  a  reference audiogram  prior  to  but  not  to  exceed  30  days  before  the  date  of  the  workers’  initial exposure  to  hazardous  noise,  including  noise  exposure  at  secondary  training  (T-0).  Exception:  For  all  new  officer  and  enlisted  accessions  who  received  a  reference audiogram  at  initial  training, they  will receive  an annual audiogram if  assigned to  a work  area  with  hazardous  noise.    Note:    Reference  Attachment  3  for  ‘reason’ selection. 2.20.10.1.1.  The first valid hearing test administered is the reference audiogram.  The  worker  must  be  informed  to  avoid  high  levels  of  occupational  or  non-occupational noise exposure during the 14-hour period preceding the examination (T-0). 2.20.10.1.2.  Hearing  protectors  will  not  be  used  to  meet  the  14-hour  noise-free requirement (T-0). 2.20.10.1.3.  The  officer  accessions  (e.g.,  Health  Professional  Scholarship Program and ROTC students) who did not receive a reference audiogram at initial training (no DD Form 2215 in DOEHRS-DR) will have an audiogram performed by Public Health at the first duty location (T-1). 2.20.10.2.  An  Audiometric  Case  History  (AF  Form  1753,  Hearing  Conservation Examination,  Section  I)  will  be  completed  on  all  reference  audiograms  (T-2).    If worse  than  H-1  hearing  levels  are  noted,  or  if  personnel  answer  “yes”  to  asterisked questions,  then  a  clinical  examination  is  required,  and  the  remainder  of  AF  Form 1753 is to be completed (T-2). 2.20.10.3.  Workers terminated from the HCP who subsequently return to  hazardous noise  duties  should  have  their  current  audiogram  compared  to  their  most  recent reference  audiogram.    If  the  current  results  do  not  indicate  an  STS,  the  most  recent reference audiogram serves as the reference audiogram.  If an STS is present, use the current audiogram to establish a new, type 3 reference audiogram (T-0). 2.20.10.4.  Maintain  a  variety  of  earplugs  and  accomplish  the  initial  earplug  fitting (T-0).  Reference the fitting and dispensing section in Attachment 4 for details. 2.20.10.5.

An  STS  includes  a  change  in  hearing  threshold  relative  to  the  current reference audiogram of an average of 10 dB or more at 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz, in either ear.  Age corrections will not be applied. Note:  A single frequency 15 dB shift at 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 Hz is considered an early warning flag with no requirements for follow-up testing or referrals, but with a requirement to counsel the patient and check hearing protection. AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 19 2.20.14.2.  When  an  individual's  audiogram  shows  an  STS  relative  to  the  reference audiogram in either ear the following must be accomplished (T-0): 2.20.14.2.1.  If  a  negative  STS  (improved  hearing  threshold  from  reference audiogram)  is  noted,  a  follow-up  test  will  be  administered  the  same  day  as  the periodic test (T-0).  The results may  be used to  create a  re-established reference audiogram to reflect the improvement in pure tone acuity. 2.20.14.2.2.  If  a  positive  STS  (decrease  in  hearing  threshold  from  reference audiogram)  is  noted,  one  or  two  noise-free  (i.e.,  no  hazardous  noise  exposure  at least 14 hours prior) follow-up tests are administered to confirm (T-0). 2.20.14.2.2.1.  The  noise-free  follow-up  tests  may  be  administered  on  the same day, but not on the same day as the periodic audiogram. 2.20.14.2.2.2.  Follow-up  testing  must  be  done  within  30  days  of  the  annual audiogram (T-0).  If no follow-up tests are performed within 30 days after the annual  audiogram,  then  the  annual  audiogram  is  considered  a  PTS  until further evaluation by an audiologist is completed.  For ARC members, follow-up testing must be done within 60 days of the annual audiogram (T-1).  If no follow-up tests are performed within 60 days after the annual audiogram, then the annual audiogram is a PTS until further follow-up is completed. 2.20.14.2.2.3.  If the result of the first follow-up test does not indicate an STS, a second follow-up test is not required, and the shift is a temporary threshold shift  (TTS).    If  the  result  of  the  first  follow-up  does  indicate  an  STS,  and  a second follow-up test is required IAW DoDI 6055.12, but the second follow-up test does not indicate an STS, then the shift is also a TTS. 2.20.14.2.2.4.  If an STS is noted on all required follow-up tests, then the STS should be considered a PTS and patient referred to the provider or audiologist for confirmation (T-0). 2.20.14.2.3.  Ensure a provider or AF hearing conservationist performs LEI prior to the noise-free audiogram (NFA) (T-1). 2.20.14.2.4.  Refit the individual with hearing protection, instruct in its care, use, and wear (T-0). 2.20.14.3.  Refer  all  patients  with  a  PTS  or  problem  audiogram  back  to  the Occupational  Health  Consultant  or  to  an  audiologist  (T-0).    They  determine  what further follow-up is required.  Reference Table  A6.1 in Attachment 6 to determine the need for an AF HCDC/HCC evaluation. 2.20.14.4.  An  audiologist,  an  otolaryngologist,  or  other  provider  will  perform  an evaluation  to  determine  whether  the  STS  is  work-related  or  has  been  aggravated  by occupational noise exposure (T-0). 2.20.14.5.  The worker is required to complete Section I of the AF Form 1753 prior to medical referral for a PTS (T-1). 2.20.14.6.  Installations  may  refer  to  other  DoD,  Tricare  network  or  Veteran  Affairs (VA) audiology clinics.  For installations that refer to non-AF audiologists, referrals 20 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 will  include  comprehensive  audiometric  testing  sufficient  to  determine  type  and degree  of  hearing  loss,  and  possible  causation  to  assist  in  determining  work-relatedness (T-0).  Audiology reports will include any  recommendations  for hearing aids, hearing protection, further medical referral, and include noise exposure history, any  known  indicators  to  the  cause  of  the  hearing  loss,  and  an  interpretation  of  tests results to explain the type and degree of hearing loss.  The clinical outcomes will be documented and properly coded in the electronic health record (T-0). 2.20.14.6.1.  For  referrals,  the  following  procedures  listed  in  paragraphs  2.20.14.6.1.1-2.20.14.6.1.6  will  be  conducted  and  the  documents  listed  in paragraph  2.20.14.6.1.7  and    2.20.14.6.1.8  will  be  provided  to  the  audiologist (T-0): 2.20.14.6.1.1.  Pure  tone  air  conduction  test,  under  supra-aural  earphones  or insert earphones, using pulsed tones for frequencies 250 Hz through 8,000 Hz (to include 3,000 and 6,000 Hz). 2.20.14.6.1.2.  Pure  tone  bone  conduction  test,  using  pulsed  tones  for frequencies 500 through 4,000 Hz (to include 3,000 Hz). 2.20.14.6.1.3.

Document  and  code  the  condition  in  the  Electronic  Health  Record  per standards outlined in the Military Health System coding guidelines (T-0). 2.20.14.9.  Re-establish the reference audiogram for a positive STS. 2.20.14.9.1.  Replace  the  original  reference  audiogram  with  a  new  reference audiogram when the medical evaluation confirms the STS noted during the annual and follow-up audiograms is permanent (T-0).  Replace with one of the following options  (as  chosen  by  the  reviewing  audiologists  or  provider)  for  re-establishing the reference audiogram (T-0): 2.20.14.9.1.1.  Use the results of the most recent follow-up test. 2.20.14.9.1.2.  Use  the  results  of  the  audiology  referral  (if  all  pertinent examiner  and  audiometer  information  are  available  for  the  DD  Form  2215).

The  USAFSAM  Hearing  Conservation  Certification  must  be renewed every 5 years. Annual  Audiogram—An  audiogram  performed  at  least  annually  (also  called  periodic audiogram). Appointing  Official—Personnel  officer  or  official  authority  to  make  management  decisions concerning hiring, placement, accommodation, and termination of employees. Audiogram—The  measurement  of  a  worker’s  hearing  sensitivity  expressed  in  decibels  as  a function of frequency.  Data are reported in graphic or numeric form. Audiologist—A clinician, researcher, or consultant, specializing in the preservation, evaluation, and rehabilitation of hearing. Close  Scrutiny  Audiogram—Frequently  administered  audiograms  used  to  closely  monitor  a worker or group.  When, on whom, and how often to perform scrutiny exams is determined by the  credentialed  health  care  provider  (provider,  nurse  practitioner,  physician  assistant  or audiologist) who performs occupational health examinations, or as directed by the OEHWG. Criterion  Level—The  sound  level  allowed  for  an  8-hour  exposure,  used  as  the  basis  for measurement of a noise standard.  For the Air Force the criterion level is 85 dBA. Department  of  Defense  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health  Readiness  System-DR—DOEHRS-HC  data  collection,  retrieval  and  reporting  site;  used  to  submit,  retrieve,  and  report DOEHRS-HC data; location for downloading updated DOEHRS-HC lookup tables. AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 33 Department  of  Defense  Occupational  Environmental  Health  Readiness  System-HC—An automated audiometric system used by the military services for hearing conservation purposes. Exchange  Rate  (or  doubling  rate)—The time-intensity exchange  rate  for determining length-intensity  of  equivalent  exposure  levels.    The  AF  uses  a  3-dB  exchange  rate.    Reference Hazardous Noise Surveillance Requirements. Fitness  and  Risk  Evaluation—Evaluations performed by medical  and safety professionals  for the  purpose  of  determining  a  worker’s  ability  to  perform  specific  job  tasks  (fitness)  and  the likelihood  of  harm,  either  to  the  worker  or  others  (risk),  in  relation  to  anticipated  workplace exposures  and  job  demands.    In  the  USAF  HCP,  fitness  and  risk  evaluations  are  the  processes used to evaluate workers who, if placed at work in hazardous noise, may not be able to perform essential duties adequately or may pose a health or safety risk to themselves or others. H  Profile—Hearing Profile threshold criteria (H-1 through H-4) are defined in AFI 48-123 and the Medical Standards Directory.  This criterion is used to identify workers for further evaluation to  determine  if  they  are  able  to  capably  and  safely  perform  their  job  in  a  hazardous  noise environment. Hearing  Conservation  Program  Manager  (HCPM)—An  individual  appointed  by  the  MTF Commander or Ground RMU/GMU Commander for ARC.  The  HCPM, usually a credentialed provider,  is  responsible  for  managing  all  aspects  of  the  HCP  while  ensuring  OSHA/DoD/AFI compliance.  However,  HCPM access  in  DOEHRS-DR is  often assigned to  the senior NCO of PH. Hearing  Conservationist—military  or  civilian  member  that  is  CAOHC  trained.    Reference Attachment 3. Impulsive or Impact Noise—A short burst of acoustic energy consisting of either a single burst or a series of bursts.  The pressure-time history of a single burst includes a rapid rise to a peak pressure followed by a somewhat lower decay of the pressure envelope to ambient pressure.  A series of impulses may last longer than 1 second.   Negative Threshold Shift (Lower Hearing Threshold than Reference)—Same criteria as STS calculations except negative shift represent improved hearing levels. Noise—Free  Audiogram  (NFA)—An  audiogram  performed  after  a  worker  has  not  been exposed  to  noise  greater  than  72  dBA  or  impulsive  noise  greater  than  120  dB  peak  for  a minimum specified amount of time.  (e.g., 14-hour NFA, requires a minimum of 14 hours noise-free prior to the test).  HPDs cannot be used to reach this noise-free status.  All noise-free follow-up audiograms must be completed within 30 days of the annual audiogram. Occupational  Health  Consultant—A  provider,  usually  a  Flight  Surgeon  that  serves  as consultant  to  primary  care  teams  for  operational  health  concerns,  including  review  of  problem audiograms,  to  determine  if  further  testing  is  required  before  disposition.    An  audiologist  can serve as a consultant for audiology/hearing conservation review/disposition concerns. OSHA Reportable Hearing Loss—If a worker’s current audiogram reveals that the worker has experienced a work-related STS (as defined) in one or both ears and the worker’s total hearing level  is  25  dB  or  more  above  audiometric  zero  (averaged  at  2000,  3000,  and  4000  Hz)  in  the same ear(s) as the STS, you must report the case to OSHA via AFSAS within 7 calendar days. Figure A1.1. Decision Tree for Reporting Hearing Loss. AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 34        Otoscopic Examination (lighted ear inspection)—The act of viewing the external auditory canal to the tympanic membrane.  This exam is accomplished with the use of an otoscope.  Peak Pressure Level—The maximum absolute level, in dB, achieved for any specified time interval.  Permanent Threshold Shift (PTS)—Any STS found on monitoring audiometry which is still present after required follow-up 14-hour NFAs is considered a PTS.  An STS on an annual audiogram is also considered a PTS if follow-up testing is not conducted in the specified time.  Positive Threshold Shift (Higher Hearing Threshold than Reference)—Same criteria as STS calculations.  Positive shifts represent poorer hearing levels.  Potential Hazardous Noise—Exposure to steady-state noise having an 8-hour TWA noise level greater than or equal to 85 dBA, or exposure to impulsive/impact noise levels greater than 140 dB peak SPL, regardless of duration.  Potentially Hazardous Noise Area—Any area where workers are likely to be exposed to noise levels equal to or greater than an 8-hour TWA of 85 dBA, or where impulsive noise levels exceed 140 dB peak SPL.  Pre-placement Audiogram—All persons entering employment in hazardous noise (greater than or equal to an 8-hour TWA of 85 dBA, the OSHA limit) will receive an audiogram prior to beginning work.  The results of the pre-placement audiogram, if meeting the requirements of a reference audiogram, may be used as the reference audiogram.  AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 35 Problem Audiograms—Audiograms that show large differences in hearing thresholds between the two ears, audiograms that show unusual hearing loss configurations that are atypical of noise induced hearing loss, and/or audiograms with thresholds that are not repeatable.  A HCDC/HCC audiologist can be consulted to review problem audiograms.  Reference Audiogram—An audiogram used as a baseline to compare subsequent audiograms against to determine if hearing loss has occurred.  All persons entering employment in hazardous noise (greater than or equal to an 8-hour TWA of 85 dBA, the OSHA limit) should receive a pre-placement audiogram that should be used as the reference audiogram. Also called baseline audiogram by OSHA.  Sound Level (Noise Level)—The weighted sound pressure level measured by the use of a meter with characteristics and weighting A. B. or C. as specified in ANSI S1.4.  The weighting must be indicated; otherwise, the A-weighting is understood.  Sound Pressure Level—The sound pressure level of a sound, in dB, which is 20 times the logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the pressure of this sound to the reference pressure of 20 microPascals (uPa) (20 microNewton/m2) (2 X 10-4 microbar).  Speech Interference Level—The arithmetic average of the sound pressure levels, in dB, of a noise in the four octave bands of center frequency 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hertz.  Significant Threshold Shift (STS) —A change in hearing thresholds relative to the reference audiogram.  An average change of 10 dB or more at 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz in either ear, according to CFR 1910.95.  That is, if the sum of the shifts at 2,000, 3000, and 4,000 Hz equals or exceeds 30 dB in either ear, an STS has occurred.  Use of age corrections will NOT be applied when determining STS.  Note:  OSHA terminology is standard threshold shift.  Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS) —A temporary loss of hearing due to noise exposure.  Any positive STS that is not confirmed by the noise free follow-up test is considered a TTS, unless there is a resolved medical condition.  Termination Audiogram—A hearing test administered and recorded on DD Form 2216 when a worker discontinues employment involving hazardous noise exposure as defined in DoDI 6055.12.  A Termination Audiogram shall be accomplished when a hazardous noise exposed worker, who has been included on the HCP, separates or retires from military/civil service.  Individuals who are PCSing, PCAing, do not require  a Termination Audiogram if a periodic audiogram was completed within 12 months.  Threshold Level—A sound level below, which exposures are not included in dose calculations or measurements.  For this standard, the threshold is 80 dBA.  Time-Weighted  Average  (TWA)—The time-weighted average sound level or exposure for an 8-hour workday and 40-hour workweek.   36 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 Attachment 2 HAZARDOUS NOISE SURVEILLANCE A2.1.  Noise Exposure Limits on Hearing.  The occupational and environmental exposure limit (OEEL) is the most appropriate limit adopted from established, recognized standards (e.g., latest edition  of  the  TLV®  Booklet  published  annually  by  the  American  Conference  of  Government Industrial  Hygienists, 29 CFR 1910.1000 Tables  Z-1,  Z-2, and  Z-3 and 40 CFR 141) for noise and  is  intended  to  prevent  damage  to  the  hearing  of  exposed  personnel.    These  noise  exposure limits  are  sound  levels  and  durations  to  which  nearly  all  workers  may  be  exposed  without permanent adverse effect on their ability to hear and understand normal speech.

Applies for on and off duty exposure.  A2.1.1.  Continuous  or  Intermittent  Exposures.  The  duration  of  unprotected  noise  exposure per  day  will  not  exceed  the  values  specified  in  Table  A2.2  for  the  levels  indicated  for continuous exposure. Table A2.2.

The limiting duration of exposure at any noise level equal to or less than 115 dBA is determined from the equation at Figure A2.1.:   Figure A2.1.  Duration of Exposure Calculation. A2.1.1.1.  If  exposures  to  two  or  more  levels  occur  in  one  day,  their  combined  effect should not exceed an 8-hour equivalent continuous level, Leq, 480 min, of 85 dB, given by the equation in Figure A2.2:  Figure A2.2.  Calculating Equivalent Sound Level. A2.1.1.2.  This  is  equivalent  to  summing  the  fractions  of  the  actual  time of  exposure  to the  allowable  time  of  exposure.    If  this  value  exceeds  one  (1),  the  combined  exposure should  then  be  considered  to  exceed  the  standard.    This  may  also  be  expressed mathematically as:  Figure A2.3.  Unity Calculation.  A2.1.1.3.  The C values  are the actual  exposure times to  a  given level; the T values  are the times allowed at those levels by Table A2.3.  All occupational noise exposures above the threshold level of 80 dBA will be used in the above equations IAW OSHA 29 CFR 1910.95. 38 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 A2.1.1.4.  For  work  shifts  other  than  8-hour  periods,  the  measured  average  noise exposure should be adjusted to an 8-hour equivalent exposure level using Figure A2.4: Figure A2.4.  Calculating 8-hour Equivalent Sound Level.  A2.1.2.  Impulsive  or  Impact  Exposures.    Unprotected  personnel  will  not  be  exposed  to impulsive or impact noise.  Reference MILSTD 1474E for impulsive noise requirements. A2.1.3.  Hazardous  Noise  Areas.    A  potentially  hazardous  noise  area  will  be  clearly identified by signs located at entrances to, or the borders of, the area.  Signs will be designed according to the guidelines in DoDI 6055.12, and will have the following message: CAUTION HAZARDOUS NOISE AREA HEARING PROTECTION REQUIRED A2.1.3.1.  Signs and/or decals  will describe (in words or with  other visual symbols) the potential  hazard  and  the  required  protective  measures  (e.g.,  “Danger”,  “Hazardous Noise”,  “Hearing  Protection  Required  When  in  Operation”).    Such  wordings  as  "When machines are operating" or "Within 25 feet of operating band saw” may be added at the bottom of the caution sign to accurately identify the noise hazard area. A2.2.  Noise Exposure Limits on Whole Body Effects.  At certain high sound pressure levels, exposed  persons  may  suffer  adverse  effects,  which  do  not  involve  the  hearing  organs.    Whole body limits are designed to prevent these effects. A2.2.1.  No octave or one-third octave band level may exceed 145 dB for frequencies in the range  of  1  Hz  through  40  kHz,  and  the  overall  sound  pressure  level  cannot  exceed  150  dB (unweighted).    There  are  no  time  limits  for  exposures  below  these  levels.    However, protecting  hearing  requires  adherence  to  the  hearing  protection  limits  mentioned  above,  in addition to the ultrasonic evaluation requirements mentioned in the next paragraph, to protect against non-auditory effects of noise; this applies regardless of any hearing protection used. A2.2.2.  The  impact  of  workplace  equipment  or  other  workplace  conditions  causing ultrasonic noise exposures will be evaluated.  The limits specified in DoDI 6055.12 and the latest  version  of  ACGIH  Threshold  Limit  Values  (TLV)  for  Chemical  Substances  and Physical  Agents  should  be  used.    Note  these  limits  are  designed  to  protect  hearing.    They apply  at  the  ear,  and  hearing  protective  devices  can  be  used  to  meet  these  limits.  Consultation  with  USAFSAM/OE  may  be  required  in  measuring  or  evaluating  ultrasonic noise.   AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 39 Table A2.3.  Exposure Guidelines for Upper Sonic and Ultrasound Noise*.  One-Third Octave-Band SPL (dB re: 20 microPascals (μPa))  Mid-Frequency of Third Octave Band Ceiling Values 8-Hour TWA (kHz) 10 12.5 16 20 25 31.5 40 50 105A 105A  105A  105A  110  115  115  115  88A 89A 92A 94A -- -- -- -- *ACGIH, 2010 TLVs and BEIs.  These recommended limits (set at the middle frequencies of the one-third octave bands from 10 kHz to 50 kHz) are designed to prevent possible hearing loss caused by the subharmonics of the set frequencies, rather than the ultrasonic sound itself.  (Also, reference most current version of American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists for updates).  Consultation with appropriate DoD Component technical centers may be required in measuring or evaluating equipment producing those levels. A Subjective annoyance and discomfort may occur in some individuals at levels between 75 and 105 dB for the frequencies from 10 kHz to 20 kHz especially if they are tonal in nature.  Hearing protection or engineering controls may be needed to prevent subjective effects.  Tonal sounds in frequencies below 10 kHz might also need to be reduced to 80 dB.  A2.2.3.  Pregnant  Workers.  Fetal  noise  is  a  controversial  topic  with  limited  research  on which  to  base  exposure  guidelines  for  pregnant  women.    A  few  studies  suggest  noise  is  a potential hazard; however, these studies provide insufficient evidence to establish firm fetal noise protection guidelines.  There is evidence to suggest that noise exposure in excess of a C-weighted,  8-hour  Leq,T  of  115  dBC  or  a  peak  exposure  of  155  dBC  to  the  abdomen  of pregnant workers, beyond the fifth month of pregnancy, may cause hearing loss in the fetus (reference  2.23.12). Job rotation or modification of job tasks should be considered to create the  safest  and  healthiest  environment  for  pregnant  workers  and  their  unborn  children.  However,  concern  for  safety  and  health  should  not  lead  to  inappropriate  actions  that  may constitute unlawful discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace. A2.2.3.1.  Job rotation should be considered but not mandated for pregnant workers who are  exposed  to  hazardous  noise  after  20  weeks.    Using  job  rotation  for  20+  week pregnancies is highly recommended but not mandated for workers having an equivalent continuous level (ECL) at or above 100 dBA unprotected exposure. A2.2.3.2.  Working  in  impulsive  or  impact  noise  environments,  requiring  hearing protection  (e.g.,  firing  ranges,  EOD  detonations,  etc.),  should  be  avoided  by  pregnant workers. A2.2.4.  If  ototoxic  chemicals  are  present  in  hazardous  noise  areas,  be  aware  the  chemicals may act in an additive or synergistic mode to increase the risk of hearing loss. 40 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 A2.2.5.  No  impulsive  noise  exposure  will  exceed  190  dB  peak  unless  an  analysis  of  non-auditory  damage  risk  is  conducted  to  include  but  not  limited  to  blast  lung  injury.    No impulsive noise exposure will exceed 197 dB peak. A2.3.  Noise  Exposure  Limits  on  Job  Performance.  Noise exposure limits in this section are provided  to  maintain  effective  job  performance.    These  limits  should  be  used  as  design recommendations in the construction of new facilities or to address concerns or correct problems arising from present conditions that interfere with accomplishing current tasks or operations. A2.3.1.  Quality  of  Person-to-Person  Communication.    The  data  shown  in  Table  A2.4 provides ranges of sound levels and the corresponding routine communication capability for several situations. When evaluating speech interference near small arms areas, or other areas where hearing protection is worn, the attenuation of the hearing protection will be taken into account. Table A2.4.  Quality of Person-to-Person Voice Communication*. Voice Levels Noise Level (dBA) Normal Voice Shouting Telephone Use Raised Voice  Satisfactory Satisfactory to 30 feet Satisfactory to 6 feet Satisfactory Satisfactory to 3 feet to 6 feet Satisfactory Satisfactory to 1 foot to 3 feet     40 to 50 50 to 60 60 to 70 70 to 80* 80* to 90 90 to 95 Above 95 Satisfactory Satisfactory Satisfactory to slightly difficult Slightly difficult  Difficult Very Difficult Unsatisfactory    Satisfactory Slightly difficult to 1 foot, Slightly difficult to 2 feet   Slightly difficult to 3 feet Slightly difficult to 1 foot *Noise exposure limits may be exceeded by a combination of noise plus voice.  A2.3.2.  Office and Work Space.  Noise measurements made for comparing noise in an office with these criteria should be done with the office in normal operation, but with no one talking at the location where speech communication is being evaluated.  Background noise with the office unoccupied should be lower by 5 to 10 dBA.  Acceptable levels are at Table A2.5 and Table A2.6.   AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 41 Table A2.5.  Noise Levels for Offices*. Range of Levels Communication Environment (dBA) 30 to 40 40 to 45 45 to 50 50 to 60 60 to 65 Very quiet office, telephone use satisfactory, suitable for large conferences. Quiet office, satisfactory for conferences at a 15 foot table; telephone use satisfactory; normal voice 10 to 30 feet. Satisfactory for conferences at a 6 to 8 foot table; telephone use satisfactory; normal voice 6 to 12 feet Satisfactory for conference at 4 to 5 foot table; telephone use occasionally slightly difficult; normal voice 3 to 6 feet; raised voice 6 to 12 feet. Unsatisfactory for conference of more than two or three people; telephone use slightly difficult; normal voice 1 to 2 feet; raised voice 3 to 6 feet. Above 65 Very noisy; office environment unsatisfactory; telephone use difficult. Table A2.6.  Noise Levels for Work Spaces*. Range of Levels (dBA) Communication Environment 70 to 80 80 to 90 Above 90 Person-to-person communication with raised voice satisfactory 1 to 2 feet; slightly difficult 3 to 6 feet.  Telephone use difficult. Person-to-person communication slightly difficult with raised voice 1 to 2 feet; slightly difficult with shouting 3 to 6 feet.  Telephone use very difficult. Person-to-person communication extremely difficult.  Telephone use unsatisfactory. A2.3.3.  Group Meeting, Study, and Rest and Relaxation Areas.  Noise measurements made to  compare the noise environment in  an area with these criteria should include internal  and external  background  noise.    Acceptable  levels  are  at  Table  A2.7.    Note:    Expected  voice represents  the  increase  of  voice  level  a  speaker  in  a  noisy  field  usually  adopts.    The communicating voice level is the voice level a speaker can produce over the range of sound levels shown when forced to communicate (achieve a 95 percent word  score, with positive, instantaneous feedback). Table A2.7.  Noise Levels for Group Meetings, Study, Rest and Relaxation*. Range of Levels (dBA) Type of Space and Activities 34 to 45 45 to 55 55 to 65 Group gatherings to listen to speech and music; low background noise and good hearing conditions required; sleeping. Areas where some concentration and relaxed communication may be desirable; reading rooms, sedentary relaxation; radio and television listening. Good communication conditions not essential; some distraction due to external noise can be permitted; internal noise generation due to other activities may be present. 42 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 * Based on recommendations outlined in ANSI S12.65, American National Standard for Rating Noise with Respect to Speech Interference.   A2.4.  Music Exposure Criteria.  Exposure to recreational music may lead to hearing damage; two  groups  are  typically  affected:  the  employees  (occupational  exposure)  and  customers (recreational exposure). The manager of each facility or activity where recreational exposure to loud music may occur should post or issue precautionary warnings.  BE personnel may provide technical assistance in initial monitoring, interpreting results, and recommending controls. A2.4.1.  Employees.    For  employees  who  have  occupational  exposure  to  music,  the  noise exposure  limits  and  other  provisions  in  this  instruction  apply  as  for  any  other  group  of occupationally exposed employees. A2.4.2.  Customers.  Entertainment planners and customers need some understanding of the hazards  associated  with  recreational  exposure  to  loud  music.  Air  Force  occupational  noise exposure standards cannot be directly applied to recreational exposures.  Assuming customer exposure to loud music is generally limited to 2-hours, once per week, the music level should not exceed an equivalent continuous level, Leq, of 94 dBA for any continuous 2-hour period at  any  customer  location.    94  dBA  is  a  guideline  and  does  not  constitute  a  never  to  be exceeded sound level.  The intent is to allow music to be entertaining within reasonable and safe limits. A2.4.3.  When  multiple  worker  days  are  used  to  determine  the  average  daily  ECL  for  an individual or group of individuals, the ECL can be used when formulating surveillance plans and will be calculated according to the formula at Figure A2.5. Figure A2.5.  Calculating Average Daily Equivalent Continuous Level. A2.5.  Noise Surveys and Dosimetry.  A2.5.1.  Frequency of Assessments.  Potential noise hazards will be identified, assessed, and controlled  as  an  integral  part  of  the  assessments  specified  in  AFPD  48-1,  Aerospace Medicine  Enterprise,  AFI  48-101,  Aerospace  Medicine  Enterprise,  and  AFI  48-145.  Specifically,  the  health  effects  of  noise  will  be  evaluated  as  part  of  routine  and  special assessments, and when operations change or new operations start.  Additionally, assessments are performed  when specific requests address  the potential for hazardous noise  exposure or evaluation of other types of requests show there to be potential noise hazards (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.95). A2.5.1.1.  An  initial  assessment  will  be  conducted  in  all  potentially  hazardous  noise areas.  Representative Leq,T noise level data will be collected for similar exposure group (SEG)  established  IAW  AFI  48-145  and  AFMAN  48-146,  Occupational  and AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 43 Environmental  Health  Program  Management,  for  all  AF  employees  (military  and civilian) working in hazardous noise areas. A2.5.1.2.  An  additional  assessment  should  be  accomplished  within  30  days  of  any change in operations affecting noise levels. A2.5.1.3.  When  the  noise  exposures  for  a  particular  SEG  are  highly  variable  or  not clearly  well  above/below  the  OEEL,  Leq,T  evaluations  will  be  accomplished  IAW  AFI 48-145 and AFMAN 48-146 to adequately characterize the noise hazard. A2.5.2.  Noise  Hazard  Survey.    A  generalized  process  sequence,  coupled  with  specified evaluation  procedures,  will  be  instituted  to  ensure  a  uniform  approach  to  noise  hazard assessment.  The objective is to determine whether noise exposures pose a significant risk to the  workers’  hearing.    There  are  three  phases  in  the  health  risk  assessment  process:  identification, analysis, and control. A2.5.2.1.  Identification.  In this phase of health risk assessment the goal is to determine whether  a  potential  or  existing  exposure  poses  a  health  threat  to  a  specified  population during  a  specified  period  and  location.    It  is  critical  to  understand  the  duties  of  the populations  and  sub-populations.    BE  will  become  familiar  with  the  processes  being performed  in  the  workplace  through  firsthand  observation,  interviews  with  shop personnel, review of existing assessment data, and epidemiological summaries completed by PH.  Potentially hazardous noise sources should be noted during this phase to identify the need for further consideration in the analysis phase. A2.5.2.2.  Analysis.    Three  types  of  noise  surveys  are  conducted  to  evaluate  the  noise environment:  the  noise  source  survey,  the  worker  exposure  survey,  and  the  hazardous noise area survey.  Data collection will be conducted when new processes are identified or  existing  data  is  no  longer  current.    Measurements  will  be  made  using  equipment conforming  to  the  appropriate  ANSI  standard  in  the  references.    All  noise  data  used  to characterize  occupational  exposures  will  be  entered  into  DOEHRS-IH.    Noise  data collected  from  711  HPW/RHCB  (Human  Performance  Wing/Battlespace  Acoustics Branch),  or  other  independent  source  on  behalf  of  the  AF,  will  be  provided  to USAFSAM/OE to disseminate to the BE career field for integration into DOEHRS-IH as appropriate. A2.5.3.  Noise  Source  Survey.    This  survey  is  used  to  classify  whether  a  particular  noise source  output  is  equal  to  or  exceeds  the  criterion  level  of  85  dBA  and  could  present  a potential exposure hazard to workers.  Sound level measurements will be made in accordance with DoDI 6055.12, using A-weighting with slow response.  If the source is determined to be potentially hazardous, engineering controls will be considered before other control measures; an  octave  band  analysis  may  be  necessary.    Historical  data  should  be  applied  to  sources  of hazardous noise that have previously been well characterized, e.g., a generator for which the sound  pressure  levels  are  adequately  assessed.    Hazardous  noise  sources  will  be  labeled where possible to warn operators of the need to wear hearing protection..  A2.5.4.  Worker  Exposure  Survey.    Where  the  potential  to  exceed  the  limits  as  discussed under  Noise  Exposure  Limits-Hearing  exists,  worker  exposures  will  be  evaluated  by  direct measurements with noise dosimeters, or indirectly with noise exposure calculations specified in Table A2.2. 44 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 A2.5.4.1.  TWA noise levels will be determined for all AF workers working in hazardous noise  areas  at  least  once  and  should  be  accomplished  within  30  days  of  any  change  in operations  affecting  noise  levels.    In  circumstances  such  as  high  worker  mobility, significant  variations  in  noise  levels,  representative  personnel  sampling  will  be conducted. A2.5.4.2.  Impulsive  noise  and  high  level  (>130  dB)  continuous  noise  cannot  be accurately  measured  using traditional  SLMs  or  dosimeters  because  special instrumentation is required.  If there is a request for additional information or impulsive noise  measurement,  contact  USAFSAM  ESOH  Service  Center,  2510  Fifth  Street, WPAFB  OH  45433,  1-888-232-3764,  or  AFRL/711  HPW/RHCB,  2610  Seventh  Street, WPAFB OH 45433. A2.5.4.3.  Worker  noise  exposure  will  be  computed  and  reported  regardless  of  any attenuation  provided  by  hearing  protectors.    However,  workers  should  understand  how hearing protection devices effect their exposure levels. A2.5.4.4.  The decision to place an individual on the HCP will be based on the likelihood of exposure at or exceeding 85 dBA as an 8-hour TWA.  The following conditions should be  considered  when  estimating  exposure  for  an  individual  or  group  of  individuals assigned  to  a  SEG.    These  conditions  are  based  on  the  assumption  of  no  exposure  to hazardous noise in these environments: A2.5.4.4.1.  Number of days spent in classroom training; A2.5.4.4.2.  Number  of  days  spent  in  administrative  tasks,  medical  appointments other duties, etc.; A2.5.4.4.3.  Number of days detailed to wing support not related to primary duty; or A2.5.4.4.4.  Number of days at formal training or temporary duty. A2.5.5.  Hazardous Noise Area Survey.  These surveys are used to define work areas where noise  exposures  are  assumed  hazardous  based  on  routine  operations.    Hearing  protection requirements  for  these  areas  should  be  made  clear  to  all  personnel  that  might  enter  these areas. A2.5.5.1.  These surveys can be used to define a work area enclosed by clear borders as a hazardous  noise  area  or  to  identify  a  hazardous  noise  zone  around  a  certain  piece  of equipment.  When marking a hazardous noise zone around a piece of equipment, careful consideration must be given to noise production variables and the equipment’s mobility. A2.5.5.2.  Instrumentation  used  for  these  surveys  must meet  or  exceed  requirements  for type  2  SLM  as  identified  in  ANSI  Standard  S1.4-1983  (R2006)  and  its  most  recent revision.  Instruments must have been subjected to a complete electro-acoustic calibration based  on  manufacturers’  specifications  before  survey.    Acoustical  calibration  must  be performed on the instruments before and after each day's measurements.  The acoustical calibrator must be accurate to within plus or minus one dB, and must have been subjected to a complete electro-acoustic calibration. A2.5.5.3.  When personal noise dosimeters are used for worker exposure measurements, they  must  integrate  all  sound  levels  from  80  dB  to  130  dB.    Dosimeters  must  meet  or exceed  specifications  in  the  latest  approved  ANSI  Standard  S1.25-1991  (R2007), AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 45 Specification  for  Personal  Noise  Dosimeters.    AF  components  will  use  a  time-intensity exchange  rate  of  3  dB.    Noise  dosimeters  are  authorized  for  use  in  Sensitive Compartmented  Information  Facilities,  but  local  clearance  will  be  obtained  in  advance through the facility Sensitive Compartmented Information Security Officer. A2.6.  Noise  Control.  Engineering  controls  are  the  first  choice  to  reduce  hazardous  noise exposures  existing  in  the  workplace.  Due  to  cost  and  design  limitations  associated  with  some engineering  control  solutions,  administrative  controls  and/or  the  use  of  personal  protective equipment may be necessary. A2.6.1.  Noise limit recommendations should be included as part of the acquisition process. If  the  required  equipment  is  not  available  within  specified  noise  output  limits,  alternate methods  of  noise  control  may  be  necessary.  This  may  also  be  the  case  when  noise  levels associated with existing equipment cannot be controlled cost effectively through engineering solutions.

Personnel performing audiograms as part of the USAF HCP will be trained as Hearing Conservationists as established by the CAOHC.  AF trained individuals may apply to CAOHC  to  receive  Certification.    It  is  recommended  that  AF  personnel  obtain  CAOHC-approved  HC  training  at  either  USAFSAM  or  DoD  component,  as  it  includes  training  on  the DOEHRS-HC  software.    Personnel  who  are  CAOHC  certified  or  receive  training  from  a CAOHC-approved  civilian  agency  must  contact  USAFSAM  to  receive  an  AF  Certification number BEFORE performing audiometric testing because he/she will need to coordinate hands-on  training  with  the  DOEHRS-HC  software.    Personnel  who  are  CAOHC  trained  by  a  DoD component  will  use  the  certification  number  issued  by  that  Service.    CAOHC-approved  re-certification is required at 5-year intervals for individuals active in hearing conservation testing. A3.1.1.  CAOHC  trained  Hearing  Conservationists,  are  not  trained  or  permitted  to  conduct audiometric testing outside of requirements outlined in  this instruction (i.e., audiograms  for diagnostic evaluations, school screenings, or hearing tests outside of the HCP with exception to Sister Service readiness audiograms and threshold audiograms performed for the purpose of separation history and physical exams). A3.1.2.  AF Certified Hearing Conservationists who perform audiograms must be responsible to an audiologist, otolaryngologists, or other provider, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.95, (g)(3). A3.2.  Audiometric  Equipment  Standards.  Audiometric  testing  done  in  support  of  the  HCP will be conducted with audiometers meeting the standards of ANSI S3.6-2010 (or current ANSI standard).  Audiometers must be DOEHRS compatible.  Audiometric testing room requirements are  reflected  in  ANSI  S3.1-1999  (R2008),  Maximum  Permissible  Ambient  Noise  Levels  for Audiometric Test Rooms. A3.2.1.  Standardized  HCP  Audiometers.    Routine  pure  tone  air  conduction  testing  is  to  be accomplished  with  standardized  HCP  audiometers.    DOEHRS-HC  is  the authorized  system for  use  in  the  HCP,  and  provides  input  into  the  DoD-wide  Occupational  Health  databases.  Data  from  diagnostic  clinical  audiometers  used  by  HCDC/HCC  can  be  input  manually.  Questions concerning the DOEHRS-HC system should be directed to the AF HCP Manager, USAFSAM/PHR. A3.2.2.  Earphones.  Only earphones meeting the requirements of ANSI Standard S3.6-2010, or  current  ANSI  standard,  will  be  used  in  the  AF  HCP  for  screenings  with  DOEHRS-HC software.    Earphones  must  ONLY  be  used  with  the  audiometer  they  were  calibrated.  HCDC/HCC  evaluations  by  audiologists  only  may  use  insert  earphones  that  have  been appropriately  calibrated  by  Biomedical  Equipment  Technicians  or  equivalent  civilian technicians.  If the STS is due to collapsing canals, it is recommended to prevent the collapse of  the  canal  by  placing  a  disposable  HPD  behind  the  pinna  when  using  circumaural earphones. A3.3.  Calibration,  Testing,  and  Functional  Checks.  All  audiometers and sound rooms must be tested and calibrated before use in the HCP. A3.3.1.  Daily Functional Check.  A daily functional check is required before each day’s use.  DOEHRS-HC software provides a functional check sequence.  The examiner should listen to AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 47 all frequencies at various intensity levels.  This general check of the machine and its function will include listening for: A3.3.1.1.  Crackling sounds or changes in loudness while moving the cord. A3.3.1.2.  The presence of tones at all frequency settings. A3.3.1.3.  Presence of tones only in the appropriate headphone. A3.3.1.4.  Periods of silence while listening to the frequency and attenuation changes. A3.3.2.  Daily  Calibration  Check.    Will  be  performed  every  day  that  hearing  tests  are administered.  DOEHRS-HC  software  provides  a  calibration  check  sequence.    An  examiner who operates the audiometer must perform the calibration check in order to verify the system is within calibration specifications.  The calibration test subject can be an electroacoustic ear or  someone  with  known  stable  hearing  levels,  free  of  ENT  problems,  and  not  routinely exposed  to  hazardous  noise.    Record  the  daily  calibration  results  on  the  DD  Form  2217, Biological  Audiometer  Calibration  Check.  Note:    Medical  Equipment  Repair  Center (MERC)  will  perform  the  equipment  calibration  when  the  equipment  is  not  within specifications according to the daily calibration check. A3.3.2.1.  If  a  change  in  threshold  of  more  than  plus  or  minus  5  dB  at  any  frequency (except  6,000  Hz),  or  more  than  plus  or  minus  10  dB  at  6,000  Hz  occurs,  repeat  the calibration  procedure.    If  the  calibration  standard  is  an  electroacoustic  ear,  reset  the headphones  and  repeat  the  procedure.    If  the  calibration  test  fails  a  second  time,  test  a person with known stable hearing thresholds. A3.3.2.2.  Headphones  are  calibrated  with  a  specific  audiometer;  do  not  mix  and  match headphones  and  audiometers  that  have  not  been  calibrated  together  by  Biomedical Technicians.    Out-of-calibration  audiometers  must  not  be  used,  checked  by  Biomedical Technicians, and repaired or re-calibrated before being placed back in service. A3.3.2.3.  Document all activities on the DD Form 2217.  A new DD Form 2217 must be established when the audiometer is re-calibrated. A3.3.3.  Annual  Acoustic  Calibration.    Audiometers  used  in  the  HCP  will  be  acoustically calibrated  by  Biomedical  Equipment  Technicians  or  appropriate  provider  of  these  services, annually.  The calibration date, taken from the hearing conservation forms, will be stored at the DOEHRS-DR for 30 years. A3.3.4.  Exhaustive  Calibration.    Performed  by  Biomedical  Equipment  Technician  every  2 years according to ANSI S3.6-2010 (or current ANSI standard).  Test frequencies below 500 Hz and above 6,000 Hz may be omitted from this calibration for those audiometers used in the HCP. A3.4.  DOEHRS-HC/DR.  All  hearing  conservationists  using  DOEHRS-HC  will  have  a  DR account. A3.4.1.  Prior to running a hearing test, previous tests must be inquired from the DR. A3.4.1.1.  If  a  previous  reference  audiogram  has  not  been  established,  perform  a reference audiogram (on DD Form 2215) using a type 1 reason, prior to noise exposure. 48 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 A3.4.1.2.  If  any  type  of  hearing  test  has  been  accomplished  previously,  an  annual  test should be performed (on DD Form 2216). A3.4.1.3.  If a new reference is warranted, use a type 3 reason, reestablished after follow up. A3.4.1.4.  If  a  member  has  separated  from  military  service  but  will  continue  in  civil service in a noise-exposed job, a new reference will be established using a type 4 reason, change in service component.  This reason will also be used if the member changes from civilian to uniformed military service. A3.4.2.  Hearing  conservation  technician  or  program  manager  must  export  data  to  the  DR every  day  that  patients  are  seen  using  DOEHRS-HC  data  export  function.    Data  must  be backed  up  to  a  secure  device  or  network  drive  daily.    When  a  new  back  up  file  is  created, previous  files  may  be  deleted.    Only  the  most  recent  backup  file  is  needed  in  case  of  a computer crash.  Exporting data to the DR is not the same as backing up the database.  Both must be accomplished.  AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 49 Attachment 4 HEARING PROTECTION A4.1.  The  use  of  personal  hearing  protectors  to  limit  noise  exposure  is  an  interim  protective measure while engineering control measures are being explored, evaluated, and designed.  Such devices will constitute a permanent measure only if the BE determines, in coordination with the workplace supervisor and the unit commander, that engineering controls are not technologically, economically, or operationally feasible. A4.2.  Personal  hearing  protectors  are  provided  at  no  cost  to  all  AF  personnel  who  work  in designated hazardous noise areas or operate noise-hazardous equipment. A4.2.1.  The  worker’s  organization  will  pay  for  the  personal  hearing  protectors  (including custom  molded  hearing  protection).    However,  if  custom  molded  hearing  protection  is required  as  determined  by  the  MTF,  the  MTF  provides  the  initial  set  and  the  worker’s organization is responsible for replacements. A4.2.2.  The  hearing  protectors  provided  must  be  capable  of  attenuating  worker  noise exposure  below  a  TWA  of  85  dBA.    If  hearing  protectors  do  not  provide  sufficient attenuation, further control of exposure will be necessary. A4.2.3.  An earplug carrying case will be made available by the owning organization (initial issue and replacement based on normal wear and tear) for each set of pre-formed earplugs.  It will  be  provided  at  no  cost  to  the  AF  personnel  who  work  in  designated  hazardous  noise areas  or  operate  noise-hazardous  equipment.    This  case  can  also  be  used  for  hand-formed earplugs.    National  stock  numbers  (NSN):      Olive  drab  color,  NSN  6515-01-100-1674  or Navy blue color, NSN 6515-01-533-6168. A4.3.  Estimating Noise Attenuation for HPD.  The noise attenuation provided by HPDs varies between wearers, even when the wearers are highly skilled at fitting the HPDs to their ears.   A4.3.1.  Multiple methods exist for selecting attenuation values; the recommended and most preferred  to  least  preferred  methods  are  listed  in  Table  A4.1  and  A4.2.    The  AFRL attenuation values along with other noise references can be found on the 711th portal/ESOH Service Center at https://hpws.afrl.af.mil/dhp/OE/ESOHSC/. Table A4.1.  Preferred Methods for Selecting Attenuation Values for HPDs for Continuous Noise.  1 - Most Preferred  AFRL ANSI measured values utilizing the ANSI S12.6 2 3 Other independent laboratories values utilizing the ANSI S12.6 Manufacturer values utilizing the ANSI S12.6 4 - Least Preferred  Manufacturer  values  utilizing  ANSI  S3.19  derated  by  50%  for  earplugs and 25% for earmuffs  50 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 Table A4.2.  Preferred Methods for Selecting Attenuation Values for HPDs for Impulse Noise.  1 - Most Preferred  AFRL ANSI measured values utilizing the ANSI S12.42 2 3 Other independent laboratories values utilizing the ANSI S12.42 Manufacturer values utilizing the ANSI S12.42 4 - Least Preferred  Manufacturer  values  utilizing  ANSI  S3.19  derated  by  50%  for  earplugs and 25% for earmuffs A4.3.2.  Methods for calculating effective noise levels at the ear.  Apply hearing protector attenuation  data  (mean  minus  two  standard  deviations)  to  noise  levels.    Note:    The  octave band  and  NRR  attenuation  data  used  for  calculation  of  the  effective  noise  level  under  the hearing  protector  shall  be  the  mean  minus  two  standard  deviation  attenuation  data.    This ensures that approximately 98% (single tail normal distribution) of the users should achieve the calculated attenuation value or more. A4.3.2.1.  The preferred method for applying hearing protector attenuation is the octave band method.  If the 8 hr TWA is greater than 92 dBA and the octave band method is not being used, the ESOH Service Center must be contacted for guidance. A4.3.2.2.  A secondary method of calculating the effective noise level at the ear using the NRR is allowable, but not preferred.  A 7 dB correction factor will be applied to account for  the  de-emphasis  of  low-frequency  energy  inherent  to  the  A-weighting  scale.  Following  the  7  dB  correction  factor,  an  additional  derating  of  50%  is  required  when ANSI S3.19 NRR values are used. A4.3.2.2.1. When using ANSI S3.19 NRR values use the following equation:                   Effective level at ear (dBA) = A-weighted level – ((NRR-7 dB) * 0.50) A4.3.2.2.2.  When  using  ANSI  S12.6  NRR  values  use  the  following  equation:                              Effective level at ear (dBA) = A-weighted level  – (NRR - 7 dB) A4.4.  Limits  of  Hearing  Protection  Performance.  The maximum possible sound attenuation provided by HPDs is limited by human body and bone conduction mechanisms.  Even though a particular device may provide outstanding values of noise attenuation, the actual noise reduction may be less because the noise surrounding the head and body bypasses the hearing protector and is transmitted through tissue and bone pathways to the inner ear. A4.4.1.  The  term  "double  hearing  protection"  for  earplug  and  earmuff  combinations  is misleading.  The attenuation provided from earplug and earmuff will be less than the sum of their individual attenuation values.  Never add individual HPD attenuation values to derive a combination  value.    Consult  the  ESOH  Service  Center  for  information.    If  no  data  is available, add 3 dB to the highest NRR of the plug or muff to estimate combined protective rating. A4.4.2.  Wear of dual hearing protection in various conditions.  When earmuffs are not worn properly (i.e., airtight seal of the earmuff to the circumaural region surrounding the pinnae of AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 51 the  ear)  the  amount  of  protection  provided  by  the  earmuff  is  greatly  reduced  and  it  is impossible to determine how much protection the worker is receiving from the noise. A4.4.3.  For  other  conditions  where  earmuffs  can  be  worn  but  an  airtight  seal  cannot  be maintained  (e.g.,  wearing  of  polar  hood/balaclava  for  cold  weather  protection),  then  the sound attenuation provided by the earmuffs in combination with earplugs and the protective head  gear    will  be  assumed  to  equal  the  attenuation  provided  by  the  earplugs  alone.  Administrative  controls  will  be  required  to  reduce  the  8-hr  TWA  to  below  85  dBA.    Shop supervisors will consult BE whenever such administrative controls are required. A4.4.4.  If  earmuffs  cannot  be  worn  due  to  other  PPE  being  worn  around  the  head  (e.g., respirator  with  airline)  then  ear-inserted  single  hearing  protection  must  be  used.    If  single hearing  protection  does  not  provide  enough  protection  to  reduce  the  TWA  8-hr  exposure below 85 dBA then administrative controls, such as reduced time in the hazardous noise area, are  needed  (assuming  use  of  engineering  controls  has  already  been  evaluated  and  is  not feasible).    Shop  supervisors  will  consult  BE  whenever  such  administrative  controls  are required. A4.5.  Fitting and Dispensing Earplugs. A4.5.1.  PH  will  maintain  a  variety  of  earplugs,  from  at  least  two  manufacturers  and including  at  least  three  sizes,  as  well  as  carrying  cases.    Individual  units  must  purchase earmuffs,  disposable  plugs,  and  other  hearing  protection  variations  approved  by  BE, necessary to protect workers fully against hazardous noise. A4.5.2.  PH  will  accomplish  initial  earplug  fitting.    PH  will  fit  and  dispense  pre-formed earplugs and/or foam plugs at the time of the audiometric evaluation.  At this time, PH will assess the conditions  (e.g., cold  weather) in  which the HPDs will be worn to  ensure proper wear  for  sufficient  sound  attenuation.    Each  ear  will  be  individually  fit  with  earplugs (approximately 20 percent of the population requires a different size of earplug for each ear).  Workers unable to be properly fit with pre-molded or foam HPD will be referred by PH to an AF audiologists or a certified licensed civilian audiologist for custom molded earplugs at AF expense. A4.5.3.  Custom molded devices may be appropriate for special circumstances.  Service band members should be provided with pre-molded or custom molded musician’s earplugs, at their unit’s  expense.    Only  audiologists,  otolaryngologists,  and  medical  providers  professionally trained in custom earpiece fabrication may take impressions of the ear necessary to make the custom molded earplugs. A4.5.4.  Workers may be fitted with pre-formed earplugs as determined by PH at the expense of the AF.  If workers request custom molded devices as a personal preference, the unit is not obligated  to  pay  for  any  additional  examinations  and  the  fabrication  of  specialized  plugs.  However,  if  a  unit  chooses  to  purchase  custom  molded  earplugs  for  their  personnel,  they must  consult  with  BE,  PH,  and  the  occupational  medicine  consultant  who  will  provide oversight  of  the  brand/type  selection,  fitting,  and  monitoring  of  the  custom  devices.    The MTF may or may not provide resources to conduct the fitting of custom molded earplugs for large numbers of personnel, depending on the availability of resources and personnel, and per the MTF commander's approval. 52 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 A4.5.5.  PH will examine the fit and condition of all HPD (certified for use by BE) during the annual  audiogram,  and  whenever  an  effectiveness  question  exists  (DoDI  6055.12  (6)(1)).  The  worker  will  demonstrate  proper  fitting  technique  at  the  time  of  the  audiogram.    If  a worker  cannot  be  adequately  fit  with  the  earplugs  recommended  by  the  BE,  an  audiologist will  determine  an  action  plan  that  ensures  the  worker  is  adequately  protected  from occupational hazardous noise. A4.6.  Types of Hearing Protective Devices. A4.6.1.  Insert  Type  Earplug.    An  insert  earplug  is  designed  to  provide  a  seal  with  the  ear canal.    There  are  three  types  of  insert  earplugs:    premolded,  formable,  and  custom  molded earplugs. Figure A4.1.  General earplug information. A4.6.1.1.  Premolded  Earplugs  (e.g.,  triple  flange,  Quattro).    Premolded  earplugs  are pliable devices of fixed proportions.  Personnel fitting and dispensing earplugs will train users on proper insertion, wear, and hygiene.  They are reusable, but may deteriorate and need replacement.  The earplugs should be discarded if they become brittle or torn, or if routine cleaning cannot remove debris.  AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 53 Figure A4.2.  Instructions for Triple-Flange Earplugs.  A4.6.1.2.  Formable Earplugs (e.g., foam).  Formable earplugs are made of material that, after compression and insertion, expands to form a seal in the ear canal.  When properly inserted,  they  provide  noise  attenuation  values  that  are  similar  to  those  from  correctly fitted  premolded  earplugs.    Formable  earplugs  are  usually  considered  disposable,  and therefore  are  more  expensive  for  long-term  routine  use.    Individual  units  may  procure approved formable earplugs.  Each earplug must be held in place while it expands enough to  remain  firmly  seated.    These  earplugs  may  be  washed  and  reused,  but  should  be replaced  after  five  uses  or  when  they  no  longer  form  an  airtight  seal  when  properly inserted. Figure A4.3.  Instructions for Foam (Hand formed) Earplugs. A4.6.1.3.  Custom Molded Earplugs.  A small percentage of the AF population cannot be fitted,  as  determined  by  the  MTF,  with  standard  premolded  or  formable  earplugs.  Custom  molded  earplugs  are  made  to  fit  the  exact  size  and  shape  of  an  individual's  ear canal.    AF  Band  members  are  authorized  to  obtain  custom  molded  musician's  earplugs without medical determination.  All individuals needing custom molded earplugs will be  54 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 referred  by  Public  Health  to  an  AF  audiologist  or  licensed  civilian  audiologist.    The selected  custom  molded  earplug  must  be  reviewed  by  BE  to  confirm  it  meets  the attenuation requirements of that individual’s workplace. A4.6.2.  Earmuffs.    Earmuffs  are  devices  worn  around  the  ear  (circumaural)  to  reduce  the noise reaching the ear.  Their effectiveness depends on a tight seal between the cushion and head. Figure A4.4.  General Information on Earmuffs (eg, noise muffs).  A4.6.2.1.  Earmuffs  and  other  HPD  with  input  capacity,  such  as  for  music  players  or built-in  radios designed  for recreational  listening will not  be used with  or as protectors.  Any HPD with input capacity must be approved for use by 711 HPW/RHCB to evaluate the  device  to  confirm  the  level  of  output  is  not  harmful,  or  limit  to  non-harmful  levels.  Consult installation BE for more information. A4.6.2.2.  Communication  Earmuff's  (Electroacoustic  Devices).    Personnel  who  must communicate  in  the  presence  of  intense  noise  use  these  devices,  as  determined  by  BE.  They  are  fitted  with  earmuffs  and,  if  needed,  a  noise-shielding  or  noise  cancelling microphone so voice communications can be achieved during various operations.  Noise exposure limits may be exceeded by the combination of external noise plus voice.  Sound levels produced by communication devices only need to be measured if they represent the primary noise exposure;  communications are  considered the primary noise source  when background noise levels are 85 dBA or less. A4.6.2.3.  Combination  Communications  Earmuff  and  Earplug.    When  extremely  high noise  levels  are  present  and  attenuation  of  communication  earmuffs  does  not  allow enough exposure time to complete the mission, earplugs can be worn in  addition  to  the earmuffs.  Custom molded earplugs can be made under the supervision of an audiologist.  This  combination  of  protection  should  provide  a  longer  allowable  exposure  time  for mission completion.  Information on modifications of earmuffs and fabrication of custom molded earplugs can be obtained from USAFSAM/PHR and ESOH Service Center. AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 55 A4.6.3.  Active  Noise  Reduction  (ANR)  hearing  protection  may  not  be  appropriate  for  all industrial and/or military environments.  Before employing ANR hearing protection, contact ESOH  Service  Center  to  assist  in  determining  the  appropriateness  and  feasibility  of  ANR applications.    Additionally,  ANR  device  data  used  in  the  HCP  should  be  IAW  the  most current ANSI standards, for measuring passive and active attenuation. A4.6.4.  Communication headsets, typically used by flight crew as hearing protection during engine start up, are designed to provide hearing protection and simultaneous communication capability and are appropriate in some environments.  Contact ESOH Service Center to assist in  determining  the  appropriateness  and  feasibility  of  these  applications.    Additionally, communication measurements should be IAW with the most current ANSI standard. A4.6.5.  Flight  Helmets.    Flight  helmets  used  during  ground  or  airborne  operations  provide varying degrees of protection from noise.  The ear enclosures in these devices determine the degree  of  protection  achieved.    Generally,  the  amount  of  protection  provided,  primarily  at frequencies below 1,000 Hz, varies with the condition of the ear enclosures and the acoustic seal.  Headset ear enclosures and ear cushions must be maintained in good repair. A4.6.6.  Hearing aids are not hearing protectors.  Certain hearing aids or surgically implanted devices may be used with over-the-ear hearing protectors after evaluation and approval by an audiologist  or  otolaryngologist.    If  approved,  the  worker  should  be  closely  scrutinized  on evaluation to determine STS after occupational noise exposure. A4.7.  Education and Training on Proper Use, Care, and Maintenance of HPDs. A4.7.1.  PH will train personnel on the proper use and care of HPD at the time of audiometric testing.    Personnel  requiring  earmuffs  (in  addition  to  earplugs)  will  be  informed  of  this requirement and educated on the importance of using adequate protection. A4.7.2.  Supervisors will instruct users on proper use and care of HPDs in the workplace as part of the annual training program. A4.7.3.  Reusable  earplugs  or  formable  devices  should  be  washed  in  lukewarm  water  with hand soap, rinsed in clean water, and dried thoroughly.  Wet or damp earplugs should not be worn or placed in their containers.  Cleaning should be done as needed. A4.7.4.  Earmuff seals should be kept clean. The plastic or foam cushions may be cleaned in the same way as earplugs, but the inside of the  muff should not  get wet.  When not in use, earmuffs should be placed in open air to allow moisture that may have been absorbed into the cups to evaporate.  Earmuff seals should be replaced as needed. A4.7.5.  Anyone  having  difficulty  in  wearing  hearing  protection  (i.e.,  irritation  of  the  ear canal(s)  or  pain)  should  immediately  report  this  to  their  supervisor.    The  supervisor  should remove the worker from exposure to hazardous noise and contact their provider or PH.  56 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 Attachment 5 FITNESS AND RISK EVALUATIONS A5.1.  Personnel  who  cannot  perform  essential  job  functions,  and/or  pose  a  safety  risk  to themselves or others, because of a medical condition, will be evaluated for fitness and risk.  The fitness  and  risk  evaluation  may  be  requested  by  the  medical  provider  or  by  line  management.  Clinical evaluations by either HCDC/HCC, other DoD, VA or network audiologist are required as  part  of  the  fitness  and  risk  evaluation.    Personnel  will  be  considered  for  a  fitness  and  risk evaluation if they demonstrate any of the following: A5.1.1.  Show a second PTS in either ear. A5.1.2.  Exceed the H-1 profile and work in a hazardous noise area. A5.1.3.  Complain  of  not  hearing/understanding  spoken  communications,  auditory  cues  or signals. A5.1.4.  Exhibit  behavior  resulting  in  invalid  or  unreliable  audiograms  (Failure  to  obtain accurate  audiometric  test  data  should  result  in  a  worker  being  removed  from  all  hazardous noise environments due to an inability to accurately monitor hearing). A5.1.5.  Exhibit  behaviors  that  call  into  direct  question  the  ability  to  work  in  the  assigned job. A5.1.6.  Cannot be fit with HPDs. A5.2.  Flying and other special operational duty personnel who meet the criteria above or exceed hearing  standards  for  their  flying  class  will  be  evaluated  as  directed  in  AFI  48-123.    Note:    A fitness and risk evaluation is performed as part of the waiver process for flying and other special operational duty personnel who exceed hearing standards IAW the Medical Standards Directory.  If there has not been a PTS since waiver approval, an additional fitness and risk evaluation is not warranted.  However, if there has been a PTS since waiver approval, consult a flight surgeon for initiating a fitness and risk evaluation. A5.3.  For  non-flying  personnel,  the  provider  initiates  the  fitness  and  risk  evaluation  in coordination with the installation level HCPM. A5.3.1.  The  provider  must  address  clinical  status  and  job  safety  in  the  Reason(s)  For Request section of AF Form 1754.  The provider may include a job capability assessment in the informed medical recommendation. A5.3.2.  The  provider  will  perform  a  clinical  examination.    As  a  minimum,  the  routine clinical  exam  (AF  Form  1753,  Section  II)  will  be  performed.    If  other  medical  conditions affect the person’s ability to perform the job capably or safely, they will be addressed in the clinical examination. A5.4.  The Job Capability and Safety Analysis. A5.4.1.  Base  Personnel  Flight  must  prepare  a  list,  using  the  AF  Form  1754,  Part  2,  of  the minimum essential tasks and auditory requirements a worker must have for job qualification. A5.4.2.  Installation  level  HCPM  completes  the  Job  Capability  Survey,  using  the  AF  Form 1754, Part 3.  HCPM interviews the worker, visits the workplace, and for each task identified AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 57 by the appointing official makes a judgment if the worker will be able to capably perform the task. A5.4.3.  When  requested  by  the  medical  provider,  the  safety  representative  in  conjunction with the shop supervisor will analyze job safety, complete AF Form 1754, Part 4, and return the  form  to  the  medical  provider.    The  Job  Capability  Survey  (Part  3)  and  the  Job  Safety Analysis (Part 4) should be performed at the same time. A5.4.3.1.  In consultation with BE and PH, Safety officials interview the worker, visit the workplace, and for each task identified by the appointing official, make a judgment as to whether the worker should be able to reasonably perform  the task without endangering themselves or others. A5.4.3.2.  The  safety  analysis  should  address,  but  is  not  limited  to,  the  following conditions: A5.4.3.2.1.  Does the worker perform tasks alone or in-groups? A5.4.3.2.2.  If group tasks are required, are visual cues available? A5.4.3.2.3.  Does the worker need to communicate to perform tasks? A5.4.3.2.4.  Do potential hazard signals exist that the worker needs to hear (forklifts, special  machinery, announcements, etc.)? A5.4.3.2.5.  Do the job tasks include confined space entry? A5.5.  Medical Determinations and Recommendations.  The medical provider will only make a recommendation whether the worker will be able to capably perform the task.  The appointing official/commander makes the final decision. A5.5.1.  To  assist  managers  in  making  employment  and  placement  decisions,  medical recommendations will be one of the following: A5.5.1.1.  Worker meets medical requirements of the position. A5.5.1.2.  Worker  meets  medical  requirements  with  an  accommodation  or  restriction.  (List recommended  accommodations or restrictions and the expected therapeutic or risk avoiding benefit considering risk management decision-making process). A5.5.1.3.  Worker  is  not  fit  to  perform  essential  tasks,  will  pose  an  undue  risk  to themselves  or  others,  or  fails  to  meet  medical  requirements  for  the  job.    The  medical provider must include reasonable justification for recommendations. A5.5.2.  A  determination  of  hearing  profile  might  also  be  necessary  IAW  AFI  48-123.    AF Form  422  and  H-1  profile  designation  are  not  appropriate  for  civilian  employees.    Hearing profiles  are  not  appropriate  for  decisions  concerning  disposition  and/or  disqualification.  Individual worker determinations are made on a case-by-case basis as outlined by the Fitness for Duty Evaluation. A5.5.3.  The  provider  may  assume  a  worker  meets  the  minimum  medical  qualifications  to perform a job in a hazardous noise environment if one of the following conditions is true: 58 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 A5.5.3.1.  Worker  has  an  H-1  profile,  can  wear  standard  HPDs,  and  does  not  report difficulty  hearing  and  understanding  routine  spoken  communications,  auditory  cues,  or signals. A5.5.3.2.  Worker  has  undergone  a  previous  fitness  and  risk  evaluation,  hearing thresholds have not changed significantly (no STS compared to most current reference), medical condition that may affect job performance in a hazardous noise job has remained stable; and the worker’s supervisor has not expressed any new concerns. A5.5.4.  The  medical  recommendation  for  placement  or  continuation  in  a  noise-hazardous job  will  include  the  following  statement  on  the  AF  Form  422,  Notification  of  Air  Force Member’s Qualification Status, or locally derived return to duty memo, “This worker meets medical  standards  to  work  as  a  [insert  job  title  and  occupation  code]  in  [insert  shop  name and number].”  If restrictions or accommodations are recommended, they should be listed on AF Form 422, or locally derived return to duty memo, along with the expected risk-reducing or therapeutic benefit. A5.5.5.  A disqualifying medical determination is warranted if: A5.5.5.1.  Allowing  the  worker  to  perform  the  job  would  exacerbate  a  preexisting medical condition and no reasonable accommodation would enable the worker to perform essential  functions  of  the  job  without  exacerbation  or  further  damage  to  the  known preexisting medical condition. A5.5.5.2.  Allowing the worker to perform the job would endanger their safety, the safety and security of other workers, or the public. A5.5.5.3.  The worker fails to meet a valid medical standard or physical requirement for placement in the position. A5.5.5.4.  The worker determined to be medically disqualified because of reasons above must be individually evaluated. A5.5.6.  A  summary  of  the  fitness  and  risk  evaluation  will  be  prepared,  using  an  AF  Form 422, or locally derived return to duty memo, by the provider and will contain the following minimum information: A5.5.6.1.  Reason for the fitness and risk evaluation. A5.5.6.2.  Clinical  status  (determination of whether a medical  condition  is  temporary or permanent, and has reached maximum medical benefit). A5.5.6.3.  Safety assessment results. A5.5.6.4.  Recommendations  for  accommodations  and  (or)  restrictions  in  the  particular job. A5.5.7.  The completed AF Form 1754 will be forwarded to PH who will then forward to the appropriate medical record authority for inclusion in the member’s medical record (T-2).  AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 59 Attachment 6 HEARING CONSERVATION DIAGNOSTIC CENTERS (HCDC)/HEARING CONSERVATION CENTERS (HCC) AND REFERRAL CRITERIA A6.1.  An  HCDC  is  located  at  an  AF  medical  treatment  facility.    It  provides  a  wide  range  of diagnostics and treatments in support of clinical referrals for hearing conservation, and provides services  to  all  other  persons  authorized  medical  care  by  AFI  41-210,  Tricare  Operations  and Patient Administration Functions. A6.2.  An  HCC  is  a  center  located  at  an  AFMC  installation  that  provides  direct  support  for referrals under the HCP. A6.3.  In order to provide support, HCDCs and HCCs must consist of an audiologist and support staff.  Evaluations by certified military or state licensed civilian audiologists are permitted.  All evaluations by non-DoD audiologists will be reviewed by the regional HCDC or HCC. A6.3.1.  The  HCDC  and  HCC  provide  consultation  and  overview  of  referrals,  so  the management  and  disposition  of  patients  meet  current  AF  standards.    Guidance  can  be  via “standing order” or record review.  Record reviews can be accomplished by fax, or encrypted email,  if  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)  compliant.    The reviewing audiologist must create an encounter in the electronic medical record to document that  a  record  review  has  taken  place  and  provide  a  patient  disposition  to  include recommendations  for  reference  audiogram  re-establishment,  return  to  duty  or  restrictions, OSHA reporting requirements and any follow-up required. A6.3.2.  At  a  minimum,  testing  capabilities  will  include  diagnostic  audiometer  equipment sufficient  to  complete  a  full  comprehensive  hearing  exam,  a  full  range  of  immittance, electrophysiological, and otoacoustic emissions equipment. A6.4.  Referral  Criteria.  Medical  providers  may  validate  a  PTS,  but  the  Occupational  Health Consultant or audiologist may be consulted to review problem audiograms to determine if further evaluation  is  required  before  re-establishing  a  reference  audiogram.    If  the  medical  provider determines no further evaluation is required, then proper documentation in the Electronic Health Record must be provided to explain why no further follow-up was required.  Medical providers should use Table A6.1. to determine if a referral is recommended.  Note:  Aircrew members who fail to meet the requirements for continued flight duty will be evaluated as specified in AFI 48-123. Table A6.1.  Referral Criteria. CONDITION On pre-placement, have a hearing profile exceeding H-1 (reference the Medical Standards Directory). For medical reasons may not be able to perform the job capably or safely in a noise hazard environment. Have a PTS following required Noise Free evaluation.  Audiologists and providers are permitted by OSHA regulations to reestablish reference audiograms without HCDC/HCC referrals, with appropriate electronic RECOMMENDED ACTION Fitness and Risk Evaluation* Fitness and Risk Evaluation* Referral to HCDC/HCC  60 AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 documentation of non-referral rationale.

Need special hearing skills and complain of hearing problems.  (For example, Morse or voice-intercept operators, air traffic controllers, etc.) Are unable to test using standard procedures or equipment. Have a 40 dB or greater difference between ears at any frequency.  (Requires masked audiogram) Have asymmetric hearing loss greater than or equal to 25 dB difference between the left and right ears at any two consecutive frequencies.

Meet other referral criteria as determined by the consulting audiologist or program manager. * Requires clinical evaluation by audiologist  Referral to HCDC/HCC Referral to HCDC/HCC Referral to HCDC/HCC Referral to HCDC/HCC Referral to HCDC/HCC Referral to HCDC/HCC (Once referral is completed annual follow-up not required if asymmetry is stable) Referral to HCDC/HCC Referral to HCDC/HCC A6.5.  Processing Patient Referrals.  Medical referrals for STS should be completed as quickly as  possible  upon  completion  of  the  follow-up  testing  process  and  are  the  responsibility  of  the medical facility, and will be completed within the designated referral timeframe. A6.5.1.  Providers  will  complete  an  electronic  referral  to  Audiology  for  further  evaluation, indicating  the  reason  for  the  referral  and  request  of  care,  and  send  the  patient  to  the appropriate  administrative  MTF  function  to  schedule  the  referral  appointment.    The  MTF scheduler  arranges  appointment  and  travel  orders,  and  notifies  the  patient,  the  patient’s supervisor, PH, and the referring provider of the date, time, and location of the appointment.  The patient’s medical  record and referral  information must be available to  the HCDC/HCC or Occupational Health consultant at the time of the examination.  The provider may use the DOEHRS-HC  generated  SF  600e,  DOEHRS-HC  Hearing  Loss  Referral,  or  the  AF  Form 1672,  Hearing  Conservation  Diagnostic/Center  Referral,  as  another  option  to  submit  the referral. A6.5.2.  When  the  local  MTF  does  not  have  the  capability  to  provide  an  examination  (or  a portion  of  the  exam)  for  the  civilian  employee,  the  MTF  may  arrange  to  have  the examination  in  the  civilian  sector  (non-DoD)  healthcare  community  after  receiving authorization from the employee’s unit commander.  The employee’s unit commander must also authorize payment for the examination.  Payment is made from the same appropriation that funds the employee’s salary IAW AFI 65-601v1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.  In cases  where  a  civilian  worker  requests  an  audiological  evaluation  for  other  than  an occupationally  related  condition,  i.e.  hearing  aid  assessment,  the  employee  will  pay  for  the evaluation at a civilian establishment and any associated costs (e.g., travel, etc.). AFI48-127  26 FEBRUARY 2016 61 A6.5.3.  In  cases  where  HCDC/HCC  audiology  availability,  travel  restrictions  or  finances prohibit  referral  to  an  HCDC/HCC,  the  patient  should  be  referred  to  a  licensed  and/or certified civilian audiologist.  Providers may consult with the AF/SG Audiology Consultant on  military  or  civilian  audiology  service  selections  and  results  interpretation.    An  AF audiologist  is  required  to  review/consult  on  all  audiometric  evaluations  performed  by  non-DoD audiologists.  See Paragraph  2.20.14.6.1 for a list of requirements. A6.5.4.  The  HCDC/HCC  audiologist  will  enter  into  the  electronic  medical  record  the audiological  evaluation  results  and  patient  disposition  to  include  recommendations  for reference  audiogram  re-establishment,  return  to  duty  or  restrictions,  OSHA  reporting requirements  and  any  follow-up  required.

The report submitted must include the results of an otological (ENT) exam, conducted by a provider, and the results of an audiological exam administered in a sound-treated booth.  Please forward both the ENT report and the audiological evaluation to the office designated to handle worker compensation claims (e.g., Civilian Personnel Office).  Bills may only be paid when we have received the ENT report and the audiological evaluation. A7.1.1.  The report of the provider's ENT examination must include: A7.1.1.1.  The date and hour of examination; A7.1.1.2.  The date and hour of the claimant's last exposure to employment related noise; A7.1.1.3.  A detailed and relevant medical history; A7.1.1.4.  The  provider's  reasoned  opinion  concerning  the  etiology  of  any  indicated hearing  loss  and,  specifically,  its  relationship  to  the  claimant's  occupational  noise-exposure history; A7.1.1.5.  The  provider's  recommendations  for  treatment,  including  the  need  for  a hearing aid; and, the provider's original signature. A7.1.2.  The report of the audiological evaluation must include: A7.1.2.1.  An  authenticated,  legible,  and  dated  audiogram  consisting  of  pure  tone  air conduction  threshold  from  250  to  8,000  Hz,  including  3,000  Hz,  and  bone  conduction thresholds from 250 to 4,000 Hz, also including 3,000 Hz; A7.1.2.2.  The  results  of  speech  reception  threshold  (SRT)  and  speech  discrimination testing, including stimuli and method of presentation (SRT and pure tone average (PTA) should agree within ± 10 dB); A7.1.2.3.  The  results  of  an  impedance  test  battery,  including  tympanometry  and stapedial reflex threshold measurements; A7.1.2.4.  The standard and date of last electronic calibration, and the name of the person who  performed  the  calibration,  (our  procedures  require  that  the  date  of  last  electronic calibration be within 1 year of the date of examination) for each instrument used; A7.1.2.5.  A  statement  regarding  the  reliability  of  the  audiological  evaluation  (if questionable,  administer  additional  tests  so  that  reliable  conventional  audiometric responses  will  be  obtained);  and,  a  statement  indicating  that  the  claimant  was  removed from any exposure prior to your examination.
