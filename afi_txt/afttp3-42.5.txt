BY ORDER OFTHE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCEAIR FORCE TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, ANDPROCEDURES 3-42.51 NOVEMBER 2003Tactical DoctrineAEROMEDICAL EVACUATION (AE)NOTICE: This publication is available digitally on the AFDPO WWW site at:http://www.e-publishing.af.milOPR:  HQ USAF/SGMD (Lt Col Fred P. Stone)Supersedes AFTTP 3-42.5, 19 Jul 2001.Certified by: HQ AFDC/CC(Maj Gen David F. MacGhee)Pages: 41Distribution: FSUMMARY OF REVISIONS:  This Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) doctrine revision updatesand  clarifies  information  throughout  the  document  including  roles,  responsibilities,  andrelationships  at  all  levels.    Chapter  2  clarifies  and  further  delineates  functions  in  the  TankerAirlift  Control  Center  and  theater  Air  Mobility  Control  Centers.  Chapter  3  summarizes  AEMilitary  Support  to  Civil  Authorities  and  incorporates  Contract  Approval  Review  Boardcertification requirements in accordance with Office of the Secretary of Defense policy.  Chapter4 expands on Special Mission Forces including Special Operations, marine expeditionary forces,and combat search and rescue.  Coalition support, detainee missions, and inter-fly  agreementshave been defined.  Unit type codes were updated and reflect changes in functions and interfacepoints.  The Allowance Standard Working Group has replaced the Equipment Review WorkingGroup  and,  in  Chapter  5,  the  Global  AE  Training  Team  and  AE  Steering  Group  have  beenreplaced  by  the  Global  Aeromedical  Evacuation  Integration  Team.    Professional  trainingincludes the recommendation for trauma and/or Emergency Medical Technician training.PURPOSE:    The  Air  Force  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  (AFTTP)  3-42  series  ofpublications is the primary reference for combat support capability.  This document, AFTTP 3-42.5, provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for AE of patients across the range ofmilitary operations, from steady state/peacetime engagements through war-winning operations.Since  AE  is  only  one  component  of  the  larger  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  mobility  airliftenterprise, the guidance is designed to assist planners in the successful integration of AE intoairlift operations and interface successfully with ground medical operations.APPLICATION:    This  publication  applies  to  all  Air  Force  military  and  civilian  personnel(including  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  [AFRC]  and  Air  National  Guard  [ANG]  units  andmembers).  The doctrine in this document is authoritative but not directive.SCOPE:  The Air Force AE system  provides  a  critical  patient  movement  capability  that  cutsacross traditional Service lines.  Since World War II, the preponderance of AE patients generatedduring  wars  and  contingency  operations  have  come  from  Army  and  Marine  Corps  groundAFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   2combat  units.    Therefore,  it  is  important  that  the  AE  system  integrates  well  with  the  medicalcomponents of all Services, not just those of the Air Force.  Moreover, during the past decade, ithas  become  increasingly  important  that  the  Air  Force  AE  system  continue  to  develop  itscapability to integrate with components of our Nation's allies.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   TABLE OF CONTENTS3PageChapter 1—AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION (AE)1.1 AE Mission

AE Mission.1.1.1.    The  Air  Force  AE  system  provides  fixed-wing  movement  of  patients  requiringsupervision  by  aeromedical  evacuation  crewmembers  (AECMs)  to  locations  offeringappropriate levels of medical care.  The AE system can operate as far forward as fixed-wingaircraft are able to conduct air/land operations.  The AE system is designed to be flexible toenable it to operate across the spectrum of potential scenarios, including but not limited to,humanitarian  and  disaster  relief  operations,  small-scale  contingencies  (SSC),  major  theaterwars  (MTW),  and  military  support  to  civilian  authorities  (MSCA).    AE  is  currentlyintegrating  their  unit  type  codes,  processes,  and  procedures  into  mobility  operations;designing elements that can be plugged in to provide additional capability, when and whereneeded, and interface with joint, coalition, and special operations that are versatile in nature.1.1.2.  The highly lethal potential of today’s battlefield, the reduced medical footprint, andthe “evacuate and replace” philosophy, have made the AE mission even more critical than inthe past.  Moreover, the evacuation of patients by air to facilities offering required levels ofcare must compete with other critical wartime airlift requirements.1.2.  AE Concepts.  AE can significantly improve casualty recovery rates by providing timelyand effective transportation of the sick  and wounded to medical facilities  offering  appropriatelevels  of  care.    The  AE  system  provides:  (a)  integrated  control  of  casualty  movement  by  airtransport; (b) clinical and operational support personnel; (c) equipment for in-flight supportivecare and ground support operations; (d) critical care air transport teams (CCATT) to monitor andmanage specific patients requiring intensive care; (e) staging facilities on or in the vicinity ofairheads and air bases for the administrative processing and care of casualties entering, en routethrough, or leaving the AE system; (f) command and control (C2) of all theater AE forces andAE operations; and (g) support to the communication network between airlift C2 agencies.1.3.  Force Health Protection:  The concept of force health protection (FHP) represents the setof  health  programs  that  protect  America’s  fighting  forces.    Casualty  care  and  managementsupport the warfighting commanders of all Services, coalition forces and civilians assigned to themilitary  through  the  provision  of  essential  care  in  theater,  followed  by  rapid  AE  to  definitivetreatment without sacrificing quality of care.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   7Chapter 2COMMAND AND CONTROL2.1.  Introduction.2.1.1.  C2 functions exercised over AE missions are consistent with those for all air mobilitymissions  and  are  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  C2  processes  described  in  JointPublication  3-17,  Joint  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Air  Mobility  Operations;AFDD 2, Organization and Employment of Aerospace Power; and AFDD 2-6, Air MobilityOperations.   In contingency operations, AE specific items will be outlined in the operationorder (OPORD) in Annex C Appendix 30 and general patient movement guidance in AnnexQ.    AE  assets  should  be  integrated  within  the  inherent  mobility  structure  established  tosupport airlift operations through the Air Mobility Division (AMD) to the wing and down toeach element.2.1.2.  Patient evacuation from point of injury to initial treatment at a health care facility isthe responsibility of each Service component.  AE is not the only mechanism for movementof patients by air.  Casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), a term used by all Services, refers tothe  movement  of  unregulated  casualties  aboard  vehicles  or  aircraft.    Medical  evacuation(MEDEVAC), on the other hand, traditionally refers to US Army, Navy, Marine Corps, orCoast  Guard  patient  movement  using  predesignated  tactical  or  logistic  aircraft  temporarilyequipped and staffed for en route care.  MEDEVAC has generally implied the use of rotary-wing  aircraft  with  medical  attendants  (MA).    AF  AE  begins  once  a  validated  patientmovement request (PMR) is passed to the AF component agency for execution.2.1.3.  Evacuation of patients between points within the theater is referred to as intratheaterevacuation,  while  evacuation  of  patients  between  theaters  is  referred  to  as  intertheaterevacuation.    In  both  cases,  en  route  care  is  provided  by  trained  AECMs,  qualified  flightnurses (FN) and AE technicians (AET), the AF AE support network, and may be augmentedby CCATTs or medical attendants.2.2.  Operational C2.2.2.1.  Steady-state/Peacetime.  Great strides have been made to standardize the AE system toensure peacetime processes mirror wartime processes.  This allows for the system to exerciseits wartime infrastructure in peacetime and enhances wartime training.  C2 of AE assets, toinclude  tasking  authority  for  AE  and  mobility  forces,  resides  with  the  normal  airlift  andmobility C2 structure.  Field and AE squadron (AES) operations will be conducted throughoperational wing C2 channels.  The Tanker/Airlift Control Center (TACC) or Air MobilityOperations  Control  Center  (AMOCC),  or  theater  equivalent,  provides  C2  for  tasking  andexecution for air mobility assets used to accomplish AE missions within their respective areasof operation.  AE cells should be established within each of those organizations to providethe  critical  link  between  C2  of  airlift  operations  and  medical/joint  interface.    The  theatervalidating  flight  surgeon(s)  (VFS)  and  patient  movement  requirements  center  (PMRC)provide operational clinical oversight of a theater’s AE operations.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   82.2.2.    Steady-State/Peacetime  AE  Structure.    Combatant  commanders  are  responsible  forintratheater  patient  movement  (PM)  within  their  area  of  responsibility  (AOR).    The  jointcommand validates theater requirements and passes AE requirements to the AF componentfor execution.2.3.  Airlift Control Agencies.2.3.1.    Tanker/Airlift  Control  Center  (TACC).    The  TACC  is  responsible  for  tasking  andcontrolling  operational  missions  for  all  activities  supporting  USTRANSCOM’s  global  airmobility  mission.    TACC  serves  as  AMC’s  Air  and  Space  Operations  Center  (AOC)  forUSTRANSCOM’s air mobility mission and its functions include: current operations, C2, AEand  aerial  port  operations,  mission  management,  flight  planning,  deployment,  diplomaticclearances, weather, and intelligence.2.3.1.1    TACC  AE  Barrel.    Barrels  task  resources  to  meet  validated  air  mobilityrequirements,  including  airlift,  tanker,  and  AE  requirements.    The  TACC  AE  Barrelfunction tasks resources to meet requirements in their area of responsibility.  Resourcesinclude AE crews, aircraft, and front-end crews.  Barrel masters from AE, airlift, andtanker functions coordinate to task active duty resources.  Access to AFRC and ANGforces is provided through a system of volunteerism.  Requirements include appropriatealert postures as well as scheduled missions.  Other airlift operations centers incorporatethis function into the AE cell.2.3.2.    Air  Mobility  Operations  Control  Center  (AMOCC).    The  AMOCC,  or  theaterequivalent,  is  each  theater’s  single  C2  focal  point  for  intratheater  air  mobility  operationsexternal to a joint task force (JTF).  The AMOCC, or theater equivalent, provides centralizedplanning, tasking, scheduling, coordinating, and C2 for assigned and attached intratheater airmobility  forces  operating  in  the  geographic  combatant  commander’s  AOR.    The  AMOCCintegrates  intertheater  and  intratheater  air  mobility  operations  to  efficiently  and  effectivelyaccomplish the theater air mobility mission and enhance the goal of seamless global mobility.2.3.3.    Aeromedical  Evacuation  Cell.    The  AE  cell  is  the  source  of  AE  clinical  andoperational  expertise  and  mission  execution  within  the  TACC/AMOCC.    The  AE  Cellprovides the critical link between C2 and operations and is the clinical interface with airliftoperations  and  the  PMRC.    AE  Cell  personnel  have  extensive  knowledge  of  flightphysiology,  airlift  AE  capability,  and  information  technology  such  as,  operational  missionplanning and tasking, scheduling, and mission monitoring of airlift and AE assets to supportPM, as well as coordination with the Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC) formedical issues.2.4.  Contingency AE Structure (refer to AFDD 2-6, Air Mobility Operations).  (See Figure2.1.)  Deployed expeditionary air and space forces are organized to ensure unity of command.Deployed AE forces will be organized within the constructs of the Air and Space ExpeditionaryTask Force (AETF) and will be tailored based on the size and scope of the operation.  C2 oftheater AE forces in contingency operations will be defined in the warning/execution/OPORD.AE assets may be under the operational control (OPCON) of the Joint Force Commander (JFC),AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   9through the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) and, when not appointed as theJFACC,  the  Commander,  Air  Force  Forces  (COMAFFOR)  for  Administrative  Control(ADCON).    The  AE  commander  is  authorized  to  communicate  directly  with  the  joint  forcessurgeon (JFS), who is assigned to the staff of the JFC.  Figure 2.1.

Joint Force Commander (JFC).  The JFC is responsible for PM in the AOR.  JFCsbelow  the  geographic  combatant  commander  level  exercise  OPCON  over  assigned  andattached forces. 2.4.2.    Joint  Force  Air  Component  Commander  (JFACC).    The  JFACC  derives  authorityfrom  the  JFC  who  exercises  operational  control,  assigns  missions,  directs  coordinationamong subordinate commanders, and redirects and organizes forces to ensure unity of the aircomponent  effort  in  the  accomplishment  of  the  overall  mission.    AE  operations  are  animportant part of the JFC’s mission, and the JFACC plays  a critical role in successful AEoperations.  The JFACC (as delegated by the JFC) exercises OPCON of assigned or attachedforces.2.4.2.1.    An  AE  planner  should  be  incorporated  into  A-5  of  the  COMAFFOR  staff  tooutline, develop, and coordinate AE theater plans along airlift routes, including numberand  location  of  AE  assets  needed  to  support  operational  requirements.    The  plannershould  coordinate  with  the  AFFOR  SG  to  ensure  visibility  of  theater  medicalAFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   10facilities/capabilities that may affect AE plans.  The team may consist of AMC Directorof  Operations  (DO)  assets  utilized  in  a  reach-back  status  to  support  the  operation  andcomponent until teams can be identified and trained.2.4.3.    COMAFFOR  Special  Staff.    For  contingency  operations,  the  COMAFFOR  specialstaff may include a senior AE expert as identified, in conjunction with the AE force provider,AMC  DO,  to  support  the  COMAFFOR  on  the  special  staff.    The  AE  expert  will  haveextensive experience in the AE system, airlift operations and plans, and will have attendedmandatory  training  as  part  of  AMC  DO  pre-selection  and  training  requirements.    In  somecases,  the  COMAFFOR  special  staff  AE  person  may  be  selected  from  the  AMC  pool  oftrained  candidates  and  conduct  business  in  a  “reach-back”  status  in  order  to  support  thecontingency.  Normally, this person will serve as the advanced echelon (ADVON) supportstaff to assist with the development of the initial AE force laydown, C2, establish AE policy,and coordinate the interface with airlift operations.2.4.4.  Director of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR).  The DIRMOBFOR is a senior mobilityofficer who is familiar with AOR or the joint operations area (JOA), and who possesses anextensive background in airlift operations.  The DIRMOBFOR serves as the designated agentfor  all  airlift  issues  in  the  AOR  or  JOA.    The  DIRMOBFOR  also  exercises  coordinatingauthority  among  the  airlift  coordination  cell,  the  AMD  air  mobility  element  (AME),  theTACC, the joint movement center, and the air operations center (AOC) in order to expeditethe  resolution  of  airlift  problems.   Finally,  the  DIRMOBFOR,  working  with  theJFACC/COMAFFOR, has a responsibility to ensure that AE assets are in-place, aligned inthe  airlift  C2  structure,  and  that  AE  missions  are  planned  and  executed.    Prior  to  acontingency the DIRMOBFOR is identified and an ADVON team is sent to evaluate theaterrequirements.2.4.5.  Deputy DIRMOBFOR.  An AE officer with extensive AE experience and knowledgeof plans and operations may serve as the Deputy DIRMOBFOR.  This individual may deployas part of an ADVON, or as a member of the AMD.  Deputy DIRMOBFOR candidates withAE expertise will be selected by the AMC DO and trained in the AOC and leadership coursesand  may  attend  the  theater  validation  course.    This  individual,  when  tasked,  will  fullyintegrate into the AMD and assist the DIRMOBFOR in all other duties as required.2.4.6.  AE Control Team (AECT).  This team is located within the AMD of the AOC and isresponsible to the AMD Chief, AOC Director, and DIRMOBFOR for current AE operationalplanning, tasking, and mission execution to the theater.  Once a validated PMR is received,the AECT coordinates airlift and AE assets to meet AE requirements, tasks the appropriateairlift wings through the airlift control team (ALCT) and air tasking order (ATO), and passesmission information to the Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC).  This team alsocoordinates  airlift  with  AME/TACC/AMOCC  to  meet  AE  requirements.    AECT  membersrequire an in-depth knowledge of AF instructions, aircraft configuration, and aircraft systems.The Joint Airlift Command and Control Course (JAC2C), the airlift planner’s course and/oran  in-depth  orientation  of  the  TACC  and/or  AMOCC  are  highly  recommended.    A  seniornurse  on  the  AECT  will  be  identified  to  coordinate  AECM  requirements  with  the  AECommand  Squadron    (AECS)  Chief  Nurse,  i.e.,  team  size  and  proficiency.    CCATTrequirements are coordinated through the theater-validating surgeon.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   112.4.7.  Air Mobility Element (AME).  The AME is the deployed liaison element of the TACCto  the  theater  AOC,  and  usually  resides  in  the  AMD.    A  description  of  the  AMD  and  itsfunctions  can  be  found  in  AFI  13-1AOC,  Operational  Procedures-Aerospace  OperationsCenter, Volume 3, Chapter 8.   Intertheater  airlift assets normally will not be attached to atheater  AETF  but  will  remain  COCOM  of  USTRANSCOM  and  OPCON  of  AMC.  Theseforces  may  be  organized  into  a  Mobility  AETF  or  AEW.    Coordination  of  airlift,  patientmovement items (PMI) and assets required to support AE will be requested through the AMEin  the  AMD.    The  TACC/AME  may  coordinate  the  use  of  theater  AE  assets  to  supportintertheater  missions.    Theater  AE  assets  tasked  to  support  TRANSCOM  intertheatermissions  will  fall  under  the  direct  control  and  TACON  of  TRANSCOM  /TACC  duringexecution  and  depositioning  back  to  the  theater  when  specified  in  the  appropriateOPORD/DEPORD/EXORD.    Otherwise,  theater  AE  assets  tasked  to  support  intertheatermissions remain under the OPCON/TACON of the theater air component and carryout thesemissions through a supporting/supported commander relationship.2.5.  Air and Space Expeditionary Forces.2.5.1.  Air and Space Expeditionary Wing (AEW).  AE will deploy/employ in war as theyexercise in peacetime.  When the size and scope of the operation  warrants  establishing  anAEW,  AE  forces  will  be  aligned  as  part  of  the  air  and  space  expeditionary  group  (AEG)under the total AEW construct.  AE standardization/evaluation will be integrated with similarWing-level functions.2.5.2.  Air and Space Expeditionary Group (AEG).  When the size and scope of the operationwarrants a minimal footprint, a smaller AEG may be deployed instead of the larger AEW.AE elements will then be aligned as part of the air and space expeditionary squadron underthe total AEG construct.  Normally an individual squadron or element should not be deployedby  itself.    When  the  size  and  scope  of  the  operation  warrants  the  presentation  of  a  singlesquadron, it should deploy with provisions for commensurate support and C2 elements andwill  appear  similar  to  an  AEG  although  some  C2  elements  may  be  positioned  “over  thehorizon” rather than deployed forward.2.5.3.    Expeditionary  Airlift  Squadron  (EAS).    The  Airlift  Squadron  is  aligned  under  theWing  structure.    Normally  a  mobility  airlift  squadron,  AE,  and  airlift  operations  areintegrated under the wing operations.2.5.4.    Expeditionary  AE  Squadron  (EAES).    The  EAES  is  assigned  to  an  AEW  andoperations  group.      The  deployed  unit  type  code  (UTC)  AECS  integrates  into  AEWoperations with the senior ranking officer designated as the EAES/CC on G-series orders.2.5.4.1.    AE  personnel  assigned  to  the  expeditionary  airlift  wing  such  as  mobileaeromedical  staging  facilities  (MASF),  AE  crew  management  cells  (AECMC),  AEcrews, CCATTs, communications, liaison teams, and AE elements within a defined AORshould be organized within an EAES.  The AECS ensures all elements are prepared toconduct AE operations as tasked by the AOC.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   122.5.4.1.1.  Air Reserve Component (ARC) Personnel.  Typically, the JFC, through theJFACC, exercises OPCON over ARC personnel that are assigned or attached to the jointforce.    ADCON  of  ARC  personnel  remains  with  the  ARC,  except  under  a  fullmobilization authorized by Congress and directed by the President.2.5.4.2.  The EAES will provide AE assets to support the wing operations center (WOC),and  establish  agreements  with  local  medical  treatment  and  base  facilities  for  liquidoxygen (LOX), biomedical, logistic, and clinical training support as required.  Requestsfor additional specialists to support AE operations in the wing or base structure should beforwarded up the wing chain of command.  The AECS can arrange support requirementsfor follow-on AE forces, as required.  In larger contingencies, there may be more thanone EAES assigned to an AEW or AEG.2.5.4.3.  The EAES/CC will  identify  officers  in  charge  (OICs)  and  non-commissionedOICs (NCOICs) of each UTC or geographic location to provide on-site direction of AEforces.  The deployed AES/CC or designee, will work with the OICs/NCOICs to ensureAFSC and operational proficiency training is accomplished at each location.  The AECSalso ensures memorandums of understanding (MOU) are established with other deployedoperations  such  as  the  medical  facility.

AE Across the Range of Military Operations.3.1.1.    Introduction.    The  nature  of  threats  impacting  the  AE  system  varies  considerablywithin the spectrum of operations.  In most contingencies, or civil disaster response actions,airlift will be the preferred means of PM.  Service or civilian modes of transportation mayassist  with  the  movement  of  casualties  from  a  forward  location  or  immediately  after  anemergent event.3.1.2.  HQ AMC is charged with the responsibility to operate the  common-user Air  Forcefixed-wing AE system, to procure and execute commercial augmentation, and administer andexecute the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  AMC has been given the overall responsibilityas the AE lead command for the Air Force.  AMC manages and operates the intertheater andAE sub-systems, CRAF, and provides AE elements and planning assistance to the theater ofoperations,  in  intermediate  supporting  theaters,  or  in  CONUS.    USAFE  and  PACAF  areresponsible  for  their  theater-assigned  AE  units  and  associated  airlift  units.    Duringcontingencies  which  exceed  theater  AE  capabilities,  AMC  will  provide  mission-specificaugmentation forces to support increased theater requirements and will expand or establishthe intertheater capability to support movement between theaters of operation, or to CONUS,as required.3.2.    Steady-State/Peacetime  Engagement  and  Crisis  Response.    To  support  peacetime  AEand train for war, the AE system will align with operational airlift processes and routes and focuson  validated  patients  requiring  in-flight  care.    AE  will  be  fully  incorporated  under  DO/Wingoperations.  As part of the global mobility task force (GMTF), AE will have a presence duringbase  establishment.    Theater  AMOCCs  and  the  TACC  will  execute  the  AE  mission  byoptimizing  the  use  of  available  multi-mission  aircraft;  mixing  cargo  and  AE  on  mobilitymissions,  and  integrating  AE  requirements  into  cargo  channel  routes.    Airlift  for  urgent  andpriority patients will be tasked from alert AE crews, diversion of in-system select (ISS) aircraft,or contracting with a civilian air ambulance (CAA).  To enhance responsiveness, AE crews andCCATTs should be strategically positioned based on airlift and key patient originating locations.(Figure 3.1)AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   15Figure 3.1.

In order to support peacetime requirements and train for war, the AE system will alignwith operational airlift processes and infrastructure and focus on validated patients requiringin-flight care.  The system will shift from routine scheduled C-9A and C-141 missions to afrequency  and  requirements-based  system  using  all  passenger-capable  mobility  airliftplatforms.  Qualified AE crewmembers will be multi-platform trained on aircraft systems andprocedures to provide optimal in-flight patient care.3.2.2.    Theaters  will  validate  patient  movement  channel  mission  requirements  through  theexisting  theater  unified  command  cargo/passenger  annual  validation  process.    Patientstraveling  as  passengers  in  a  Temporary  Duty  (TDY)  status  must  be  validated  as  clinicallyable to do so by the theater PMRC and granted duty pax priority.  Associated costs with theuse  of  seats  on  military  lift  by  patients,  attendants,  and  AE  assets  will  be  outlined  inappropriate DOD Instructions (DODI) and joint publications.3.2.3.  Patients requiring in-flight medical care, but not supported by the organic AE system,may be moved via other Service  assets or civilian air  ambulance  (CAA).  Outpatients andeligible  beneficiaries  needing  air  transportation,  but  not  requiring  in-flight  care,  can  bemoved  by  commercial  airline  travel,  contract  airlift,  duty  passenger  travel,  or  in  a  spaceavailable status in the DOD transportation system, as validated by the PMRC.3.2.4.  In the AE system, CAA should only be used when AE requirements cannot be filledwith organic aircraft.  In accordance with Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) policy,Contract  Approval  Review  Board  (CARB)  approval  is  required  on  all  commercialconveyances contracted by the military to move passengers, patients, or paratroopers. AMCcontract airlift will be CARB certified.  However, non-CARB certified CAA may be used inAFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   16emergencies  to  save  life,  limb,  eyesight,  or  in  the  event  that  serious  threat  of  significantdeterioration in medical condition exists.3.2.5.  AE Military Support to Civil Authorities (MSCA).3.2.5.1.        Those  activities  and  measures  taken  by  DOD  components  to  foster  mutualassistance and support between  DOD  and any civil  government agency  in  planning  orpreparing for, or in the application of resources for response to, the consequences of civilemergencies or attacks, including national security emergencies. (DODD 3025.15)3.2.5.2.  The Air Force AE system supports patient evacuations  accomplished  throughthe National Disaster Medical System.  USTRANSCOM is the authority that validatesthe requirement to support civilian authorities with Director of Military Support DOMS,Federal Emergency Medical Agency (FEMA),  and the NDMS.  Once validated, AMCand TACC are the lead operational authority (LOA) for AE planning, coordinating, and,when  directed,  executing  MSCA  support.    AMC/DO  also  provides  trained  AEcoordinating  officers  and  coordinating  elements  for  MSCA  from  existing  active  andreserve  component  forces  in  execution  of  the  Federal  Response  Plan  (FRP)  in  thecontinental United States. AE assets required will depend on the size and scope dictatedby the disaster or contingency and may be supported by in-place AE infrastructure or thedeployment of AE assets to the disaster area.3.2.5.2.1.  ANG  AE  assets,  being  part  of  their  state’s  Emergency  Management  Plan(EMP),  may  be  mobilized  and  deployed/employed  in  a  state  activated  status  prior  tofederalization.3.2.5.3.    AMC  plays  a  key  role  in  response  efforts  by  providing  experienced  AEpersonnel, planners, and support staff.   With proper authorization, AE personnel may beused to support local efforts at command and control centers, staging at existing airports,and/or AE liaisons at medical treatment facilities preparing patients for in-flight care.3.3.  Deterrence and Contingency Operations.  AE forces are incremental and can build from asmall liaison team to a full theater AE system (TAES).  The initial, expeditionary, AE assets candeploy far forward, are mobile, and support the various medical ground units from all services.3.4.  War-Winning Operations.  During support  of  war-winning  operations,  AE  employs  itsfull  capability,  to  include  staging,  AE  aircrew  members,  specialty  teams,  and  integratedcommunications.    During  wartime,  AE  includes  the  movement  of  military  casualties  fromforward airfields to more capable facilities farther to the rear and, if required, on to definitivecare facilities.  The AE system may be tasked to transport injured/ill special operations forces,provide  support  for  noncombatant  evacuation  operations  (NEO),  and/or  evacuate  injured/illrepatriated US or allied prisoners of war (POW).  On certain occasions, the AE system may alsobe tasked to evacuate injured/ill enemy prisoners of war (EPW), detainees, and coalition forces.Finally,  during  war-winning  operations  AE  includes  transportation  of  patients  to  andredistribution within CONUS.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   173.5.  CONUS Contingency AE.  AE missions returning patients from the theater will deliver thepatients  to  CONUS.    Staging  facilities  will  be  strategically  placed  to  support  defined  airliftroutes.  Additional medical assets may be required to support patients at organic enroute hubs.Redistribution of casualties in CONUS may also involve a network of commercial airlift.  Forwartime  operations,  the  CONUS  patient  redistribution  system  and  AE  requirements  will  bedefined in the Integrated CONUS Medical Operations Plan (ICMOP) created by United StatesJoint Forces Command.3.6.  AE Interface With The Joint Community.  A PMRC is responsible for identifying MTFcapability,  regulating  patients  to  the  closest  capable  facility,  clinically  validating,  andcoordinating with service components for patient evacuation.  This process matches the patient toa MTF with the necessary  capabilities and bed availability.  PMRs are validated before beingturned over to the Service component for execution.  The airlift operations centers may requestother destinations due to availability of airlift and routes to support AE.  These decisions will becoordinated with the PMRC.3.7.  AE Interface with the Patient Movement Process  (Figure 3.2)3.7.1.  Patient Movement Request (PMR).  The PM process begins when the health care unitsends  a  PMR  to  the  servicing  PMRC  (attachment  2,  Patient  Movement  Planning  andExecution Algorithm).  The PMRC evaluates the request for necessity, acuity, and eligibility.PMRs are submitted to the PMRC by the service medical  patient  administration  person  ineach  facility  and  will  be  communicated  through  TRAC2ES  for  patient  in  transit  visibility(ITV).  Operational tracking of AE missions will be through standard air mobility automatedsystems.3.7.2.  Patient Movement Requirements Centers (PMRCs)—Global, Theater, and Joint.  ThePMRC  is  a  joint  activity  that  is  responsible  for  PM  management  and  coordination.    ThePMRC  validates  patient  movement  requests,  regulates  patients  to  appropriate  medicalfacilities  for  continued  medical  care,  and  determines  the  mode  of  transportation  (air,  sea,ground).  PMRCs should exist at the joint level, as an element of the joint movement center,to ensure visibility of joint assets for PM lift options.  PMRC staffing includes flight nurses(FN)  as  patient  movement  clinical  coordinators  (PMCC).    One  or  more  theater  VFS  areassigned or delegated by the theater Command Surgeon to work with the PMCC.  TheaterVFSs provide physician medical direction and clinical oversight of PM validation, transfer/enroute care planning, and en route  care, as needed, during  AE.  The PMCCs provide  flightnursing  and  administrative  expertise  during  validation  and  may  be  delegated  validationauthority by the VFS for routine patients using approved algorithms.3.7.3.    Patient  Movement  Clinical  Coordinator  (PMCC).    A  PMCC  is  a  flight  nurse  (FN)assigned to a PMRC who provides clinical and flight nursing oversight for clinical validationof  patient  movement  requests.    The  senior  PMCC  may  establish  training  requirements  forPMRC  personnel,  conducts  case  reviews,  develops  PMRC  clinical  practice  guidelines  forpersonnel  (FN  or  enlisted  medical  technicians)  performing  clinical  regulation/validation  inthe  PMRC,  and  defines  the  scope  of  practice  for  clearing  patients  by  PMCC’s  when  anoriginating MTF flight surgeon is not available.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   183.7.4.    Patient  Administration  Director  (Clerk/Officer)  (PAD)  or  the  Medical  RegulatingOfficer (MRO) is responsible for contacting the PMRC with PM requirements and submittingpatient  movement  data.    This  individual  manages  patient  numbers  and  bed  classifications,determines  availability  of  facility-based  resources  to  assist  with  the  movement  of  patients,and coordinates the use of those assets.  The PAD/MRO serves as the liaison between thereferring  physician  and  medical  staff,  the  patient,  and  the  PMRC  and  is  responsible  forinputting patient data for PM requests.Figure 3.2.

Mission Coordination and Operational Considerations.3.8.1.  Management of  AECMs.    Management  of  AECMs  is  essential  for  efficient  systemoperations.   Crew  management  and  tasking  includes  support  to  all  aircrews,  AEcrewmembers, CCATTs, and other supporting medical augmentees.  AE crew managementwill be integrated into mobility aircrew tasking orders, airlift stage management operations,and crew alert processes.  AE crews will be alerted in the same processes other ACMs arealerted, i.e. aircraft commander (AC).  It is the medical crew directors (MCD) responsibilityto contact the command post, enroute, to find out the next mission’s AC and provide the ACwith required information to ensure an integrated  crew  response  to  the  upcoming  mission.AE equipment will be considered part of aircrew equipment.3.8.2.  AE Mission Priorities.  PM priorities for AE missions will be derived from situationalfactors and/or individual patient clinical conditions.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   193.8.3. DOD Definitions for Theater Evacuation Precedence:  Times begin once a patientis validated and stabilized for movement (Intertheater pickup will add 12 additional hours).The timeframes are expected response time, but can be negotiated with the lift agency (referto JTTP 4-02.2, Patient Movement in Joint Operations).  In contingencies, follow Annex Qdirectives for specific joint operation priorities.the  mission  has  been identified,   Once   Mission  Coordination. 3.8.4. theAOC/AMOCC/TACC  will  task  mobility  wings  for  airlift,  crews,  and  augmentation  assets(equipment and/or specialized medical personnel support).  The AE cell or AECT will passmission information, including aircraft arrival and departure times, through the Wing as wellas to the servicing PMRC and originating and destination health care facilities.  The AE cellwill coordinate ground transportation to/from the flight line.  The AE cell or AECT will flightfollow the mission and all operational aspects of AE.3.8.5.    Unregulated  Casualties.    When  security  or  operational  conditions  exist  that  wouldrequire  casualties  to  be  moved  immediately,  patients  may  be  moved  without  prior  PMRCvalidation.  However, a VFS or medical authority will be identified to clear the patients forthe AE environment.  In each case, the originating AE component will attempt to alert theAECT of the departure of AE missions with unregulated patients.  The AECT will then notifythe PMRC.3.8.6.    Patient  Considerations  and  Preparation  for  AE.    Proper  clinical  preparation  for  AEincreases the likelihood of successful patient outcome.  Originating physicians and staff, inconsultation  with  local  flight  medicine  personnel,  should  begin  preparatory  actions  byoutlining, to the PMRC the care plan the patient requires en route.  Every effort should bemade to identify age groups, (e.g. neonates) and clinical disease states that require or couldrequire specialty care  en  route.    Lastly,  psychiatric  patients  must  be  carefully  assessed  fortheir potential for presenting an in-flight risk to flight safety because of their demonstratedbehaviors.3.8.7.  Patient Stability.  Patients validated for transportation by air must be stabilized (secureairway,  controlled  hemorrhage,  treated  shock,  and  immobilized  fractures)  as  much  as  thesituation and resources allow.  Potential interventions (i.e., IV or Foley catheter) should beinitiated  prior  to  flight,  when  possible.    Patients  not  clinically  stable  due  to  severity  ofwounds  or  medical  condition,  limited  medical  resources,  or  time  constraints  may  requireadvanced clinical capability while awaiting transport at an airhead or during flight.  At times,the  patient's  clinical  instability  may  be  the  very  reason  that  they  are  being  moved  from  alesser  capable  facility  to  another  of  greater  capability.    The  AE  system  provides  qualifiedflight  nurses  and  AETs  who  are  augmented  by  CCATTs  or  other  MAs,  based  on  patientstability and condition.3.8.8.  Patient Preparation.  The physician should consider the  care needed both in the  air(such as availability of special equipment and cabin altitude) and at interim stops, and consultwith a VFS as required.  The physician has responsibility for patient classification, movementprecedence,  reporting,  documentation,  and  preparation.    The  originating  MTF  will  ensurepatients are prepared for AE to include anti-hijacking security inspection.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   203.8.9.  Management of Patient Weapons.  During contingency operations, weapons will bereturned  to  the  user  Service  or,  in  special  situations  (special  mission  forces  activities)weapons will be cleared and transported in accordance with (IAW) aircraft regulations andGeneva  Conventions.    Explosive  and  hazardous  items  found  with  patients  will  also  bereturned to the patient’s Service.  AE forces should outline a procedure if ordinance is foundon casualties entering the AE system.  Removal of weapons and munitions require host forceprotection personnel intervention.3.8.10.    Patient  Essentials.    Patients  will  be  transported  with  their  medical  records  orevacuation  battle  tag,  valuables,  personal  effects,  and  medically  essential  items  IAWestablished regulations.  Medical equipment and supplies required to support patients duringevacuation are referred to as PMI and should be coordinated with the AE system in advance.The originating facility will be responsible for providing these items and should provide a 1-day minimum of supplies, except for PM from theater to CONUS and within CONUS wherea 3-day minimum should be provided.  While in theater, patients should also be transportedwith their chemical warfare/biological warfare (CW/BW) gear as applicable.3.8.11.  En Route Care.3.8.11.1.    En  route  care  requires  the  use  of  state-of-the-art,  lightweight,  medicalequipment to ensure the evacuation system is able to successfully transport a patient fromthe point  of  injury  or  illness  to  definitive  care.    Configuration  and  medical  equipmentinterface  with  the  aircraft  is  of  utmost  importance  and  is  one  of  the  competenciesdemonstrated by the AECM.  En route care equipment and supplies will be standardizedthroughout  the  system  and  will  comply  with  air-worthiness  requirements.    This  willensure rapid equipment exchanges and forward re-supply.3.8.11.2.    Documentation.    The  DD  Form  602,  Patient  Evacuation  Tag,  or  AF  Form3899, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Record, should accompany each patient to ensureappropriate care is documented during transport and serves as the legal record of patientcare while in the AE system.  These documents are primarily used to direct and record enroute care.  A DD Form 601, Patient Evacuation Manifest, should be completed for eachAE  mission  if  an  automated  manifest  is  unavailable.    See  AFJH  41-313  AeromedicalEvacuation Documentation.3.8.11.3.    Clinical  Considerations.    Clinical  considerations  include  standards  of  care,performance, and practice throughout the continuum of care as well as nursing guidelines.These  are  outlined  in  the  Air  and  Surface  Transport  Nursing:  Principles  and  Practicehandbook available in all AE units.3.8.11.4.    Standards  of  Performance.    The  standards  of  performance  are  the  expectedlevels of function of a care provider, based on education, level of experience, and criteriaof current position and Air Force specialty code (AFSC) requirements.  AE assets, at aminimum will be proficient in their AFSC defined readiness skills verification standards.3.8.11.5.    Standards  of  Practice.    Standards  of  practice  are  the  identified  levels  ofaccomplishment that focus on medical personnel and includes competence, experience,AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   21and  education.    The  primary  goal  of  AE  medical  transport  is  to  meet  the  perceived,actual, or potential health needs of the patient while maintaining the continuum of care.Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards areapplicable to patient care in AE.  A qualified senior nurse will be identified at each AEelement to ensure patient care teams are experienced and competent to provide for thetype  of  patient  care  required.    CCATTs  co-located  with  the  operations  should  beconsulted to ensure their training needs are met.  The senior nurse will also mix teamsand shifts to ensure each patient care team meets standards of practice.3.8.11.6.  Nursing Care Guidelines.  AECMs/CCATTs must ensure that every effort ismade  to  provide  continuity  of  care  for  each  patient.    The  MCD  and  charge  medicaltechnician (CMT) will supervise, and assist the other AECMs while they perform patientcare.  The CCATT physician is clinically responsible for care given to CCATT-assignedpatients.  See Air and Surface Transport Nursing: Principles and Practice handbook3.8.11.7.    Physician  Roles  and  Responsibilities.    The  following  contains  guidance  andinstructions for DOD and Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) physicians and healthcare providers on the proper procedures to follow when validating and preparing patientsfor AE.3.8.11.7.1.  Referring Physician Responsibilities.  The referring physician is jointlyinvolved in preparing patients for AE with the nursing and administrative staff as wellas  the  VFS.    The  referring  physician,  in  partnership  with  the  VFS,  maintainsresponsibility for the patient until the patient is under the direct care of the receivingphysician  at  the  destination  medical  facility.    Responsibility  can  be  transferred  toanother  physician  when  accompanying  the  patient.    If  any  patient  concerns  ariseduring transfer, the AECT/AE cell will be notified for guidance or coordination.  TheAECT/AE cell may contact the PMRC or referring physician for further direction.3.8.11.7.2.  MTF Flight Surgeon (FS) Responsibilities. The flight surgeon (FS) is thelocal  authority  for  determining  whether  patients  are  physiologically  ready  for  airtransport.  If one is not available, the theater VFS should be available for consultationThe local FS is responsible for continually assessing an AE patient’s clinical status toassure  the  status  is  unchanged,  particularly  just  prior  to  departure  or  if  furtherstabilization is required.  The FS may also determine if the patient’s category shouldchange and adjust enroute clinical care as indicated to safely transport patient.  Thelocal  FS  provides  flight  medicine  oversight  of  patients  remaining  over  night  atstaging facilities unless the patient is transferred to other physicians for specialty orhigher-level care.3.8.11.7.3.  Medical Attendant (MA) Responsibilities.  The majority of AE missionsdo  not  require  MAs.    MAs  should  only  be  requested  in  unusual  cases  because  itdiminishes  the  originating  facility’s  capability  to  care  for  others.    AE  crewsdemonstrate competency in routine and intermediate patient care and can adjust crewsize  and  proficiency  to  support  most  patients.    All  MAs  will  be  familiar  with  thepatient  and  possess  the  level  of  skills  appropriate  to  the  patient's  needs  and  areresponsible  for  providing  and  coordinating  patient  care  requirements  with  theAFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   22MCD/FN.    A  physician  accompanying  the  patient  is  the  clinical  authority  for  thatpatient's care.  Documentation of patient care and medication administration in flightis the responsibility of the MA.  The MA will remain with and accompany the patientto the health care facility or may be relieved by another competent caregiver.3.9.  Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT).3.9.1.  A CCATT is a specialty care or critical care team authorized operational support statusthat  can  be  added  to  the  basic  AE  crew  to  provide  a  higher  level  of  care  to  critically  illpatients during AE staging and flight.  When in flight, the CCATT physician is responsiblefor  clinical  decisions  and  care  concerning  the  critically  ill  patient(s)  and  works  under  theoperational direction of the MCD for mission management and the aircraft commander foroperational management.  In the event of potential threats to the aircraft or crew, during mostcontingency operations, casualties will be brought quickly to the flight line where they willbe assessed on or near the aircraft.3.9.2.  While en route, the staging facilities should be notified of any unusual or critical caresupport  requirements  during  remain  overnight  or  extended  periods  on  the  ground.    Thestaging  facility  should  arrange  for  patient  care  coverage  to  ensure  the  CCATTs,  MA,  orAECMs are allocated rest/recovery periods between flights.  If they are unable to meet theneeds of the patient, the PMRC, TACC, and aircrew should be notified in advance.3.9.3.    Requests  for  CCAT  teams  come  from  the  originating  physician,  PMRC  VFS,  ordestination-accepting  physician.    CCATTs  are  tasked  to  augment  theater  evacuationrequirements as directed by the AECT, AMOCC, or the TACC AE cell.3.10.  Special Considerations.3.10.1.    Do  Not  Resuscitate  (DNR)  Patients.    When  a  patient  is  diagnosed  as  having  aterminal condition, the medical records must clearly state the patient’s condition.  Almost anypatient can be moved by AE if the proper care environment and specialized medical team isprovided.  AE personnel are not allowed to accept partial resuscitation orders.  Terminally illor  severely  traumatized  patients,  whose  condition  is  so  unstable  that  flight  survival  isunlikely,  should  not  be  moved.    However,  the  tactical/resource  situation  in  a  contingencymay require movement of such patients in spite of this recommendation.  In these situationsan  AF  Form  3838,  Do  Not  Resuscitate  (DNR)  Certification  For  Aeromedical  Evacuation,should be considered.  In accordance with AFI 41-301, Worldwide Aeromedical Evacuation,AE patients must have an order that indicates either full resuscitation or DNR.  This order isannotated on the patient’s DD Form 602, Patient Evacuation Tag, must be signed no morethan 72 hours prior to the originating flight and will cover the entire time in the AE system.During the aircrew brief, the MCD will review the DNR issues and procedures with the ACand aircrew to prepare for a possible death in-flight.  Attending physicians should addressDNR status of peacetime AE patients facing imminent death or classified as very seriously ill(VSI), recognizing that the stresses of flight may pose significant risk for precipitating death.The theater VFS will validate peacetime DNR patients for whom AE poses an unacceptablerisk of death or injury.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   233.10.2.  Apparent Patient Death In-Flight.  The MCD/FN will advise the AC of an apparentin-flight  death  and  notify  affected  medical  facilities  of  the  situation.    In  order  to  maintainpatient confidentiality, no specific personal information is transmitted.  The patient will bereferred to by patient cite number only.  If the next stop is not the patient’s destination andthe aircraft is not in a critical phase of flight, the MCD may contact the AE C2 agencies todiscuss options.  If the aircraft is in a critical phase of flight or has landed, the MCD willcontact the AE C2 agencies and make arrangements to have a physician meet the aircraft andpronounce the patient dead.  The patient will then be off-loaded.  If the next destination is thedeceased deplaning point, the body will be off-loaded regardless of whether it is a military orcivilian facility.  Once the patient has been pronounced dead, continued airlift ceases exceptin unique situations and upon communication between the MCD/AC and C2 authorities.  Ifairlift is continued, ensure a death certificate is included in the individual’s record.  Contaminated  Patient  Considerations. 3.10.3.   Contaminated  patients  must  bedecontaminated  before  entering  the  AE  system  unless  the  combatant  commander  andUSTRANSCOM/CC  direct  otherwise  (AFDD  2-8.1).    Decontamination/isolation  andprocessing  procedures  must  be  in  place  to  prevent  spreading  or  further  damage  fromchemical,  biological,  radiological,  nuclear,  and  high  yield  explosive  (CBRNE)  threats  andensuring the appropriate protection for patients, aircrew, and aircraft.  All procedures must bereviewed with the aircrew by the MCD or flight surgeon.  Patients with disease conditionsresulting from biological warfare should be decontaminated and have appropriate treatmentinitiated.  Caregivers at the referring  facility  must  ensure  that  patients  with  communicablediseases are prevented from spreading the disease through the use of protective equipment bythe patient and/or the crew, as deemed necessary by the theater VFS.  A presentation of  alarge  number  of  patients  needing  decontamination  can  overwhelm  the  AE  system  anddiminish mission capability.  AF Manual (I) 44-156, Treatment of Biological Warfare AgentCasualties, gives detailed information for moving patients suffering from biological warfareexposure.3.10.4.  Medical Emergency in Flight.  All in-flight occurrences will be reported to the airliftoperations center through the AC.  The AECT or AE cell will establish a phone patch with atheater medical authority if clinically applicable.  Upon completion of the mission, the MCDwill contact the AECT or AE Cell to coordinate follow-up actions and requirements.  AFI 41-302 Chapter 5, AE Patient Safety/Quality Program, provides AMC policy on guidelines forimplementation of AE event/near miss.3.10.4.1.  When medical emergencies occur during flight, providers must take reasonableand necessary action, within their knowledge and experience, to preserve life and health.FNs will immediately start interventions following the most current advanced cardiac lifesupport (ACLS)/basic life support (BLS) guidelines.3.10.4.2.  The AC must be notified immediately regarding the gravity and nature of thesituation.  The AC and team will take appropriate actions, including landing at the nearestairfield that can both operationally support the airframe and provide medical support forthe patient.  In critical circumstances, the MCD may request the AC declare an in-flightmedical emergency to expedite landing.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   24Chapter 4PLANNING AND SUPPORT CONSIDERATIONS4.1.  Movement of Casualties.  The movement of United States (US) casualties is accomplishedby all available forms of transportation, including ships, ground vehicles, and rotary- and fixed-wing assets.  Although  evacuation of patients from levels one (front line operations/unit levelcare) and two (basic resuscitation and stabilization) is normally a Service responsibility, AE unitsmay, depending upon the operational situation, evacuate casualties from forward airfields whenrequested  to  do  so  by  the  combatant  commander  (See  AFDD  2-4.2,  Health  Services  for  adiscussion on levels of care).  AE planning requires the integration of Joint and Service specificcapabilities into the theater or JFC's concept of operations.  Health service support considerationsinclude the tactical mission and situation, enemy and friendly capabilities, threat assessment, andthe theater evacuation policy.  AE planners are an integral part of the airlift planning team andshould build appropriate AE support into the enroute structure.  The AE planner should interfacewith medical planner to ensure appropriate medical capability along airlift routes4.2.  AE Planning Factors.  Medical planners must take many factors into account to select thebest or most appropriate means of executing each AE mission.  Airlift routes -are identified inorder to establish potential AE plans.4.3.  Theater Evacuation Policy.  The theater evacuation policy states the maximum number ofdays (hospitalization and convalescence) a patient may be held within the theater for treatment.Patients who, in the opinion of appropriate medical authority, cannot be returned to duty (RTD)within the prescribed period are evacuated as soon as practical to the next appropriate level ofcare for further treatment.  The evacuation policy is normally 7 days for the combat zone and acombined total of 15 days for the combat zone and the communications zone, in accordance withguidance  from  the  Secretary  of  Defense  in  coordination  with  the  geographic  combatantcommander and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Upon execution and during operations,the theater evacuation policy may be adjusted based on various factors including the number ofdefinitive  care  beds  available  in,  or  deployable  to,  the  theater.    It  is  important  to  note,  theevacuation policy does not imply that a patient must be held in the theater for the entire periodidentified in the theater evacuation policy.4.4.    Airframe  Considerations.    It  is  critical  to  identify  the  availability  of  various  airliftplatforms  that  are  appropriate  for  the  volume  and  clinical  requirements  of  the  patients  to  bemoved.  The AE Cell or AECT are resident experts in AF mobility airlift capabilities and systeminterface.4.4.1.    Organic  Mobility  Lift  and  In  System  Select  (ISS).    Organic  aircraft  are  serviceairframe assets that have been obtained primarily through mission tasking or through en routediversion  and  mission  reprioritization  for  AE  use.    Organic  airlift  is  the  major  airframecomponent of expeditionary AE.  Requirements can vary from obtaining a seat  to  movingambulatory  patients  (or  procuring  a  pallet  position  to  move  litter  patients)  to  as  much  asprocuring  an  entire  aircraft  to  perform  a  single  mission  or  routine  channel  mission.    Theairlift  operations  centers  have  visibility  of  airlift  operating  in  the  AOR  and  may  divert  aAFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   25mission, ISS, to support the patient request.  The AE cell/AECT coordinates AE tasking toensure all assets are available to support the ISS mission.  All regrets will be turned back toPMRC to determine alternative lift options.4.4.2.    AE  Civil  Reserve  Air  Fleet  (CRAF).    The  AE  CRAF  program  provides  airliftplatforms, upon contract activation, from commercial airlines specifically to perform/supportAE  missions.    CRAF  AE  equipment  is  supported  through  “ship  sets”  that  providecomponents  necessary  to  convert  the  Boeing  767-200/200ER/300/300ER  aircraft  to  aconfiguration capable of performing AE missions.4.5.  Airfield Capability.  The mobility enroute structure and proximity of medical facilities tothe airfield determines AE laydown.  Proposed onload, en route, and offload airfields must beable  to  support  the  operation.    The  AE  Cell  or  AECT  coordinates  with  airlift  operators  todetermine operating restrictions such as quiet hours, no-light operations, approach  restrictions,refueling restrictions, time to upload and download patients, etc.  In addition, mission plannersmust  consider  flight  line  security,  secured  launch,  and  PHOENIX  Raven  requirements  fordesignated airfield locations.4.6.  Potential Hostile or Terrorist Locations.  The requirements for security forces to supportaircraft during AE missions must be considered in the planning and airlift planning process.  ThePHOENIX Raven program provides these specially trained security forces personnel to protectAMC aircraft and will be included on all AE missions to locations designated “Ravens required.”AECMs will carry weapons, when appropriate and authorized, to protect themselves and theirpatients.4.7.  Base Operating Support.  AE operations depend on integration with the Line of the AirForce (LAF) to provide base operating support .  This support is needed for AE units attached tospecific  locations  as  well  as  en  route  transient  support  during  patient  evacuation  through  thesystem  and  must  be  coordinated  with  appropriate  agencies  prior  to  deployment.    Theserequirements  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  transportation  (including  patient  transportation),messing  and  other  consumable  materials,  water,  fuels,  cryogenics,  LOX  and  other  gases(obtained from fuels or on a contract basis), billeting, latrines, showers, laundry, and security.Additional  requirements  include:  alternate  generator  support  (primary  generator  capability  isincluded  in  allowance  standards),  fire  protection,  vehicle  maintenance  support,  vehicledecontamination,  maintenance supportiveinformation/communications  systems  maintenance,  waste  management,  and  personneldecontamination.    AE  UTC  mission  capabilities  statements  (MISCAPS)  must  be  reviewed  todetermine  specific  requirement  especially  in  regard  to  communication  and  transportationsupport.contracting, support, and logistics, life 4.8.  Resupply.  Sustained AE operations are dependent upon a well-designed resupply systemfor the continued availability of consumable medical supplies and PMI at all en route supportlocations.  Planning for onboard or transportable therapeutic oxygen and any associated resupplyis essential to prevent mission delays.  The AE planner should work with the medical planner tooutline logistics hubs and personnel to support LOX refill and PMI, BMET support in the theaterand enroute.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   264.9.  Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET) Support.  Equipment repair is essential inthe theater for routine maintenance and minor repair.  Deployed MTFs (and potentially civilianand coalition facilities) can support AE equipment repair and maintenance in steady state but notsurge periods.  Therefore the AE planner should insert AE BMET capability into potential hubsand align with local medical treatment facilities to ensure AE equipment is processed to meetmission requirements.4.10.  Communications.  Planners must ensure AE communication capability is integrated withthe mobility airlift and communication squadron network.  Communication must be maintainedwith subordinate deployed AE elements that may not be on or near an AF wing.4.11.  Ground Transportation.  Most AE units deploy with integral transportation capability forlimited  patient  and  crew  transport  at  forward  locations.    AE  planners  should  ensure  properaircraft support equipment is available at the airfield, i.e. support pallets and loading systems.The  MTF  is  responsible  for  transport  to  the  aircraft.    Medical  planners  should  determine  theavailability  of  other  Service  ambulances  and  vehicles  and,  if  necessary,  establish  contracts  orobtain host-nation support.  4.12.    Determining  Crew  Support.    It  is  imperative  that  planners  ensure  crew  resources  areallocated  appropriately  and  a  designated  replacement  schedule  to  replace  crews  departing  thetheater  must  be  established.    Consideration  must  be  given  to  length  of  crew  duty  day,augmentation of basic crews, required crew rest period, as well as ensuring transportation andbilleting arrangements.  Aircrews  and  CCATTs  should  be  positioned  with  MASF  and  AECMstage management sites to allow for rapid response.4.13.  AE Interface with Special Mission Forces.4.13.1.    Special  Mission  Operations  and  Rescue.    Some  special  mission  operations  andexpeditionary  forward  deployed  operations,  such  as  Special  Operations  (SOF),  marineexpeditionary  forces,  and  combat  search  and  rescue  (CSAR)  do  not  possess  organicconventional AE capability and must identify requirements for, and obtain conventional AEsupport at forward airbases.4.13.2.  Casualties.  Evacuation of casualties within the joint special mission arena can be aparticularly complex issue since these forces often operate in small, widely dispersed teams,and in locations not easily accessible.  Flexibility and sensitivity to the particular needs of thespecial mission community, both clinically and administratively, is important to consider indetermining  how  to  best  support  their  AE  requirements.    This  includes  instances  wherecasualty  identification  must  be  protected  and  not  entered  into  the  regulating  system.    Thespecial mission forces are responsible for care and evacuation of casualties from the forwardlocation to the secure airfield where AE forces may be prepositioned to support the operation.The special mission teams will conduct the evacuation of patients on their organic vehiclesand should not require any AE/CCATT interface.  At the secured airfield AE/CCATT assetswill assume responsibility for the casualties, freeing special mission medical assets to returnto forward locations.  AE assets will  provide  the  support  required  to  AE  patients  to  reachdefinitive  care.    To  prevent  personnel  with  critical  specialties  from  being  evacuated  fromAFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   27theater,  Special  Mission  Forces  personnel  may  require  a  separate  evacuation  policy  tofacilitate reconstitution.4.13.3. Training to Support Forward Special Missions.   Normally,  the  interface  point  withspecial operations is the MASF.  MASF personnel have contingency operations training andin  forward  locations  must  be  ready  to  perform  AE  missions,  as  well  as  provide  limitedholding for patients having been provided resuscitation and surgical intervention.  A CCATTand/or additional crews may augment the MASF as required.    AE missions originating atsecure  forward  airfields  may  require  AE  operations  in  low  light  or  blackout  conditions.When supporting these forces, AECMs/CCATTs need to be trained in trauma training, lowlight/low  noise,  weapons,  and  survival  in  austere  locations  to  meet  special  missionrequirements.  The planner should understand the need for limited resources and yet versatile,flexible capability to support special missions.4.13.4.  Special Ops Critical Care Air Transport Team (FFQC4).  Specialized CCAT teamstrain  with  the  AF  Special  Ops  Forces  (SOF)  to  meet  their  unique  mission  requirements.These  teams  provide  care  to  casualties  transiting  the  SOF  casualty  evacuation  system  andprovide  continued  trauma  and  post-operative  casualty  management  aboard  organic  SOFaircraft and other opportune evacuation platforms.  SOF Medical Elements (SOFME) are onoperational  support  flying  status,  have  been  trained  in  SOF  aircraft  and  attend  the  AETechnician course.  If the situation warrants, conventional CCATTs are authorized to fly withSOFMEs on organic SOF aircraft.4.14.  Detainee Missions.  Detainee missions fall under the responsibility of security forces andare politically sensitive.  Normally a CONOPs is written to outline roles and responsibilities.  AEforces should receive training in advance of supporting these missions and must follow securityforces guidelines at all times.4.15.  Inter-fly Agreements with MAJCOMs, Service, and Coalition AE Support.  The AirForce employs fixed-wing aircraft for the movement of patients and utilizes AECMs to supervisemedical  treatment  of  those  patients.    Other  services  and  coalition  forces  use  various  groundtransport, and rotary and fixed-wing aircraft for PM.  They also use their own medically trainedcrewmembers or MAs.  US Air Force AE aircrew members may perform appropriate duties innon-US Air Force aircraft if it is in the interest of the US Government and approved by both thetheater combatant commander and the controlling aircraft authority.  In addition, coalition forcesmay  also  integrate  with  AE  forces.    The  AE  planner  will  identify  the  potential  need.    Theoperations  center,  in  peacetime  or  wartime,  normally  works  inter-fly  agreements  through  theLAF.    In  peacetime,  MAJCOMs  may  require  inter-fly  agreements  to  be  processed  before  AEcrews from one command can fly with others.4.16.    Operations  Phasing  and  Force  Sequencing.  AE  forces  provide  a  rapid,  flexible,incremental,  mobile  response.    UTCs  are  selected  to  provide  the  required  level  of  command,control,  communications,  patient  care,  and  system  support.        This  allows  planners  to  selectspecific  packages  required  to  support  steady  state  as  well  as  contingency  operations,  or  thoseused for developing MTW operation plans (OPLAN).AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   284.17.  AE UTC Employment Concept.  All AE UTCs are lighter and modular to optimize useof limited airlift during the initial phases of an operation, without sacrificing capability.  Some ofthe equipment UTCs are man-portable to ensure AE can be employed in the very early stages ofa contingency.  The concept is to employ an immediate, versatile, and flexible AE presence torespond  to  the  needs  of  the  deployed  forces.    Personnel  will  need  to  be  multifunctional  andcapable of performing additional duties.  After the initial buildup, the planners can augment thedeployed teams with more manpower and equipment (augmentation packages), as required, tosupport more intense or ongoing operations.4.18.  AE UTC Selection and Utilization.  AE UTCs are developed based on the building block“plug-in/pull-out” principle, allowing planners to select specific UTCs capable of supporting therange of steady state, contingency or MTW OPLANs.  The UTCs are divided into three majorcategories:  command  and  control,  patient  care,  and  support,  and  are  designed  to  meet  highlymobile and austere conditions.  As workload changes or is projected to change, UTC packagesmay be deployed or redeployed in small increments or  combined with other UTCs to providecapability needed.4.18.1.  Command and Control UTCs:  C2 UTCs, AECT and EAES, are outlined in Chapter2 and integrated with airlift operations.4.18.2.  Patient Care UTCs.4.18.2.1.  Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Member (AECM).   The  AECMs  perform  in-flight  patient  care  on  any  fixed-wing  aircraft  using  medical  equipment  that  meetsairworthiness testing certification standards.  Crewmembers are knowledgeable about thestresses of flight and effects of altitude on patients, basic trauma skills, and patient safety.AECMs are experts on the interface between aircraft systems and medical equipment tomeet  patient  care  requirements.    Crews  can  also  augment  any  ground  UTC  requiringadditional clinical  management  or  mission  support  capability.    The  basic  AECM  teammay  be  tailored  by  the  designated  chief  nurse  to  support  the  patient’s  needs  andrequirements.  During execution of the AE mission, AE crews and CCATTs are directedby air operations center in control of the airlift mission, i.e. AECT/AMOCC for theater orTACC for intertheater airlift.4.18.2.1.1.    Medical  Crew  Director  (MCD).    The  MCD  is  a  qualified  flight  nursedesignated  and  trained  as  the  AECM  responsible  for  overall  management  of  aparticular AE mission and provide oversight of nursing care.  The MCD utilizes allresources on-board and works closely with all attendants and team members, and theaircraft  commander  to  ensure  the  safety  of  all  patients,  passengers,  attendants  andcrew.    When  a  significant  change  in  patient  medical  status  or  concern  regarding  apatient’s  capability  to  tolerate  the  airborne  environment  occurs  the  MCD  shouldcontact the AMD/TACC AE cell to coordinate with the PMRC.  The PMRC on-calltheater  VFS  is  available  to  provide  clinical  guidance.    If  the  PMRC  cannot  becontacted,  the  MCD  is  the  senior  medical  authority  for  all  patient  care  issues  andshould render care within his or her scope of practice, available clinical resources on-board, and current standards of care.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   294.18.2.2.  Critical Care Air Transport Team (CATT).  CCATTs provide specialized care,in  conjunction  with  AE  crews,  to  evacuate  critical  patients  requiring  advanced  careduring  transportation.    Recognized  as  clinical  experts,  these  teams  are  medicallyresponsible for their patients and function under the in-flight direction of the MCD andAC.  The CCATT physician is clinically responsible for care given to CCATT-assignedpatients and may be asked to assist or advise on the care of the other patients.  CCATTsmay be staged at crew bed-down locations with fixed and/or mobile AE staging facilities.Teams  positioned  in  staging  facilities  may  augment  the  patient  care  capability  of  thatfacility.  CCATTs may be assigned leadership functions within their assigned UTC andwing consistent with rank, training and experience.  AE missions that require CCATTaugmentation  will  be  identified/validated  by  PMRC/AECT.    The  theater  validatingsurgeon, in conjunction with the CCATT director, designated by the AES CC, normallycoordinates individual CCATT mission requirements.  The CCATT physician determinesteam requirements based on each mission and may pair and tailor as needed.  The AECTmonitors, tracks, and informs the PMRC on the use of CCATT resources.4.18.2.3.  Aeromedical Expeditionary Support Equipment Package.  When AECMs andCCATTs are deployed to forward locations  early in an operation  or  to  support  GlobalMobility  CONOPS,  a  Base  Operating  Support  (BOS)  equipment  packages  includingtents,  generators,  and  a  vehicle  (when  tasked)  may  be  used  to  support  their  BOSrequirements.4.18.2.4.  Mobile Aeromedical Staging Facility (MASF).    The MASF provides rapidresponse  patient  staging,  limited  holding  and  AE  crew  support  capability  to  supportSSCs, humanitarian and civil disaster response operations, and MTWs.  The MASF isnormally located at or near airheads capable of supporting mobility airlift.  The MASF isdesigned to provide forward support with the smallest footprint.  It is made up of threeshort crews,  communications, liaison,  and  patient  care  teams.    When  crews  are  taskedfrom the MASF, they should be rapidly backfilled because the nurses and techs are alsoutilized  for  patient  holding  capability.    The  MASF  includes  a  capability  to  receivepatients,  provide  supportive  patient  care,  and  meet  administrative  requirements  on  theground while awaiting AE.  CCATTs should be assigned to every forward based MASFto  enhance  rapid  evacuation.    Additionally,  the  MASF  equipment  package  containssleeping tents to provide BOS for deployed personnel.  The communications capabilityassigned  to  the  MASF  may  be  integrated  into  the  tanker/airlift  control  element  oroperations cell.  An individual may be identified to work with the aerial port element onthe flight line to coordinate AE load planning, configuration, and operational support.4.18.2.4.1.    MASF  Augmentation.    The  MASF  may  be  augmented  with  additionalpersonnel and equipment to increase patient staging capability as needed.4.18.2.4.2. The Contingency Aeromedical Staging Facility (CASF).  The CASF maybe  used  at  major  inter-theater  hubs  to  support  the  full  spectrum  of  contingencyoperations  and  Air  and  Space  Expeditionary  Force  (AEF)  operations  includinghumanitarian  relief  operations  (HUMRO)  and  homeland  defense  missions.    TheCASF interfaces with the AE mission and falls under the command and control of themedical group commander.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   304.18.3.  Support UTCs.4.18.3.1.  AE Liaison Team (AELT).  The Air Force AELT provides support between theforward user and the AE system in the form of operational and clinical interface.  Thisinterface may occur at locations that do not otherwise have AF personnel on them such asfar forward/bare bases and shipboard.  An AELT may be geographically separated fromthe other AF assets.  The flight nurse on the team assists the medical unit in preparing AEpatients for flight.  The administrative officer is responsible for working with the airliftcenter and aerial port element to ensure the aircraft is properly configured and equipmentpallets, patients, and AE support personnel are properly manifested on the AE mission.The  communications  personnel  will  be  integrated  into  the  airlift  operations  elementsupporting  flight  line  operations  or  the  WOC.    Establishing  a  communication  networkwith airlift operations is essential for rapid evacuation.4.18.3.2.    Crew  Management  Cell  (CMC).    The  CMC  provides  direct  supervision  andcrew  management  for  assigned,  attached,  and  transiting  AE  crews  and  CCATTs  inconjunction  with  the  TACC/AMOCC,  AECT  and  base  operations,  as  applicable.    TheCMC  coordinates  requirements  to  include  launch  and  recovery,  life  support,  billeting,food  service,  transportation  and  administration  for  AECMs/CCATTs.    In  addition,  theCMC may assist AECMs and CCATTs with aircraft configuration.  This UTC managesand  tracks  equipment  for  AECMs  and  CCATTs.    The  CMC  can  be  deployedindependently  or  in  conjunction  with  other  UTCs  to  meet  mission  requirements.    ThisUTC is for use in the tactical environment.4.18.3.3.    AE  Stage  Management  Team  (ASMT).    The  ASMT  is  integrated  into  theAMCC  and  located  at  strategic  airlift  hubs  or  en  route  locations  to  support  aircrews,equipment,  and  launch  and  recover  operations.    The  ASMT  manages  assigned  andtransiting  AECMs/CCATTs,  aircraft  configuration,  and  equipment  to  include  CRAFsupport, patient loading interface, and re-supply of in-flight kits, medications, and patientliquid oxygen.  Communications capability will be integral to the AMCC.4.18.3.4.  AE Support Cell (AESC).  The AESC provides communications and air  andspace ground equipment (AGE) maintenance support to all UTCs assigned to the TAES.The AESC should be staged with equipment at key locations, normally with the AECS,within  the  AOR  to  support  AE  requirements.    Communications  networks  will  beintegrated with airlift operations.  The AESC may have BMET support to ensure routineinspection  and  simple  maintenance  of  AE  equipment  can  be  conducted  in  the  AOR  orwithin  the  theater.    At  sites  with  MTFs,  a  MOU  may  be  established  with  these  AEBMETs augmenting MTF teams.  Major equipment repairs should be conducted at PMIcenters with equipment swapped out to ensure theater capability is not degraded.4.18.3.5.  PMI teams are composed of medical logistics teams and biomedical equipmentrepair teams.  The logistics teams provide manpower for operational management of thePMI  center.    Duties  consist  of  storage,  reception,  inventory  control,  issue,  palletizing,shipping,  and  identification  of  equipment  requirements.    The  equipment  repair  teamsprovide regional maintenance and repair capability for equipment in PMI centers and/orAFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   31cells.  Duties include scheduling and completing scheduled preventative maintenance andcalibration, repair and maintenance services, and updating the PMI information system.4.19.  AE Mission Support Equipment.4.19.1.  Patient Support Pallet (PSP).  The PSP will provide litter capability on the tankeraircraft and expands litter capacity on some airlifters.  The PSP is a  modified  463L  palletwith litter positions and seats and is centrally managed by AMC.  It is designed to supportsteady-state  theater  operational  requirements  as  well  as  PM  on  opportune  airlift  withoutintegral  litter  capability.    As  a  result,  the  PSP  increases  the  number  of  MDS  capable  ofperforming AE missions. (See PSP CONOPs published by HQ AMC).4.19.2.  SPECTRUM.  The SPECTRUM patient care module is routinely used on operationalsupport aircraft to support urgent, single patient requirements (including infant isolette).  Theaircraft  usually  require  modification  to  accept  the  SPECTRUM.    The  base  of  theSPECTRUM contains oxygen, electrical outlets and suction to support patient care.  Patient  Loading  System  (PLS). 4.19.3.   The  PLS  is  the  preferred  method  forenplaning/deplaning  patients  in  tanker  and  CRAF  aircraft.    However,  the  K-loader  orequivalent may be used for patient loading if no PLS is available.  While the PLS actuallyused  in  support  of  AE  CRAF  missions  and  operated  by  Aeromedical  Staging  Squadronpersonnel  at  strategic  hubs,  there  is  also  a  need  for  PLS  to  support  tankers,  and  otheropportune AE missions during day-to-day operations at forward locations.4.20.  AE Equipment and Supplies.4.20.1.  Sustained medical logistics support for AE operations is essential.  Reachback andresupply operations ensure sustainment of theater AE forces.  Maintenance and refilling ofliquid  oxygen  containers  requires  qualified  LOX  personnel.    LOX  refilling  agreementsshould  be  coordinated  by  the  EAES  commander  with  the  respective  supporting  operationsgroup.  Other items of interest are the shipment of in-flight medical kits and interface withprime vendor suppliers to fulfill deferred procurement items.  Planners should identify supplyhubs requirements and request additional support AE operations, i.e. additional LOX supportpersonnel at airlift hubs and logisticians at deployed locations.  The initial point of entry intothe logistics chain will be at the attached wing level.  Medical supplies may be supported bythe  proximal  MTF  medical  logistics  function.    In  large  operations  or  contingencies,  aninterface  with  single  integrated  logistics  manager  (SIMLM)  system  may  be  generated.Requirements for class 8 supplies will be processed through the established theater system.Reachback to CONUS or home unit is not advised.4.20.2.  Responsibilities.4.20.2.1.    AE  Equipment:    The  in-flight  and  theater  AE  environment  exposes  medicalequipment  to  unique  stresses.    Equipment  should  be  able  to  withstand  environmentalextremes  of temperature  and  humidity,  aircraft  vibration,  altitude  and  rapiddecompression of the aircraft, and electromagnetic interference to and from the aircraft.Interface with the aircraft should not pose any safety hazards to the patients or aircrew.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   32Equipment  items  are  tested  and  certified  as  airworthy  and  compatible  with  Air  Forcemobility airlift.4.20.2.2.    As  the  lead  command  for  AE,  HQ  AMC  provides  continuous  review  andoversight  of  the  AE  system,  thus  ensuring  the  AE  force  is  appropriately  supplied  andequipped to perform the mission.  AMC Director of Plans and Programs is responsiblefor integrating AE into mobility airlift and requirements for new equipment to supportAE.    AMC  DO  manages  day-to-day  oversight  of  AE  equipment.    The  AllowanceStandard Working Group (ASWG) consists of representatives from all AE components(active,  guard,  reserve)  and  includes  aircrew  members,  nursing,  administration,operations, communications, and logistics personnel.  This group was chartered by AMCto  be  the  AE  equipment  review  authority.    The  ASWG  reviews  equipment  packageallowance  standards,  examines  new  equipment  requirements,  and  coordinates  with  theHuman  System  Center—Technical  Planning  Integrated  Product  Teams,  Air  ForceMedical Logistics Office, and the Joint Readiness Clinical Advisory Board to facilitatestandardization and compatibility with the joint community.4.20.2.3.  The Air Force Medical Development Laboratory (AFMEDL) at Brooks AFB,Texas,  is  responsible  for  the  airworthiness  evaluation  process  for  new  or  proposedmedical devices for AE and coordinating with AMC.    All medical equipment utilizedfor AE must be certified by AFMEDL as safe for use in aircraft.4.21.  Patient Movement Items (PMI).4.21.1.  A major factor in the movement of patients through the levels of care is to ensurespecific medical equipment and durable supplies designated as PMI are available.  The PMIsystem supports in-transit patient care capability without removing equipment from patients.The system  exchanges like-kind PMI without degrading medical capabilities, and providesprompt  recycling  of  PMI.    The  system  provides  a  seamless  in-transit  patient  and/orequipment management process from initial entry into AE to the patient’s final destination.PMI system UTCs deploy in support of the AE system and are collocated with AE at keyinterface points to provide initial AE operational capability, to sustain AE operations, and tominimize equipment turnaround time.  Equipment will be managed, supplied, and resuppliedthrough the PMI centers and joint transportation and logistics systems.  It is the originatinghealth care facility’s responsibility to provide the PMI required to support the patient duringevacuation.  Services should plan, program, and secure equipment that is air certifiable to usein deployable platforms.  In a contingency, the PMI cell may be collocated with the SIMLM,normally at a robust air and logistics hub.4.21.2.  While the PMI program is mandated by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (HealthAffairs), the USAF/SG has oversight responsibility, and AMC/SG has program managementresponsibility.4.21.3.  MAJCOM and theater surgeons are executive managers of PMI within their areas;i.e.,  AMC/SG,  PACAF/SG,  USAFE/SG.    Usually  positioned  at  strategic  AE  hubs,  PMIcenters will store and maintain PMI while actively interfacing with AE operations.AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   33Chapter 5TRAINING5.1.  Objective.  The overall objective of the AE training program is to develop and maintain ahigh state of mission readiness of AE personnel for rapid  employment  across the spectrum ofoperational  requirements.    AE  personnel  should  be  able  to  interface  with  airlift  operations,prepare  any  mobility  aircraft  for  patient  evacuation,  and  provide  appropriate  en  route  and  in-flight patient care intervention using certified AE equipment..5.2.    Responsibilities.    HQ  AMC  is  the  lead  command  for  AE  as  specified  in  AFPD  11-2,Aircraft  Rules  and  Procedures,  and  AFPD  10-21,  Air  Mobility  Lead  Command  Roles  andResponsibilities.  HQ AMC is responsible for standardizing aircrew flying training requirementsin coordination with other user MAJCOMs.  The AMC Director of Operations (HQ AMC/DO),is the lead command designee for training course requirements, training tasks, and coordinatingthe development and publication of AE training standards.  The Global Aeromedical EvacuationIntegration Team (GAIN) is the clearinghouse for clinical and operational issues that impact theglobal AE system.  The GAIN interacts with appropriate agencies, such as AMC SG for CCATTand  AE  clinical  guidelines,  to  develop,  standardize,  and  evaluate  programs  and  platforms  inresponse to customer requirements.5.3.  AE Aircrew Training/Qualification.5.3.1.  The USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) located at Brooks AFB, TX isresponsible for the formal school syllabus for AE crewmembers, which includes training inaltitude  chamber,  survival,  clinical,  AE  equipment,  and  ground  training.  Currently,  theprimary method of AE aircrew qualification is to complete unit-qualification training in theirunit-specific mission design series (MDS).  All AECMs meet requirements listed in AFI 48-123, Medical Examination and Standards, and complete physiological training.5.3.2.    Qualification  training  may  occur  at  the  unit  level  until  a  formal  AF  school  isestablished.    Ground  training  covers  aircraft  systems,  aircraft  emergency  equipment,  lifesupport, medical emergency equipment, and patient care procedures.  Flight training consistsof  training  flights  that  reemphasize  ground-training  areas  in  an  operational  environment.Students  must  experience  a  variety  of  mission  scenarios  during  their  training  to  includeaircraft and medical emergencies as well as survival, evasion, resistance, and escape training.5.3.3.    All  available  mobility  aircraft  are  considered  for  patient  transport.    The  existingaircraft certification program is designed for qualified and current AECMs to train and orienton aircraft (which they are not qualified on) prior to performing an AE mission.  Minimumrequirements for certification include aircraft emergency procedures and equipment, groundand in-flight safety issues, compatibility of AE equipment with the aircraft, and a ground orflight training period.  Certification has the same training objective as qualification, except itdoes not require a flight evaluation (refer to AFI 11-2AE Volume 1).AFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   345.4.    AE  Contingency  Operations  Training  (AECOT)  and  Formal  Training  Courses.AECOT is conducted at Sheppard AFB, Texas and provides initial and sustainment training atvarious  sites,  including  the  Air  Mobility  Warfare  Center,  for  all  AE  UTCs  as  well  as  UTCsaugmenting  AE,  such  as  CCATTs.    The  course  emphasis  is  on  readiness  and  preparation  forwartime  or  contingency  operations  and  teaches  personnel  the  entire  spectrum  of  AE  groundoperations.    Training  encompasses  all  phases  of  deployments  to  include  predeployment,employment,  post-employment,  and  post-deployment  activities.    Formal  training  courses  mayconsist  of  patient  care  within  the  AE  system,  hazardous  cargo  certification,  cargo  processing,pallet  building,  vehicle  loading,  aircraft  configuration,  aircraft  load  planning,  and  aircraftloading.5.5.  Operations Training.  Many courses are available for airlift operations training.  The AirMobility  Operations  Course  offers  personnel  insight  into  mobility  operations.    The  AOC  andJAC2C courses are the basic training platform for airlift operations center personnel.  The AirliftPlanners  course  is  also  available.    Stage  Management  courses  for  scheduling  and  managingaircrews will be required for the CMC and ASMT.   Training sites providing practical, tacticaltraining scenarios, load-out training, and joint C2 relationships are highly recommended.  Thiscannot be overemphasized as AE personnel may deploy far forward.  AMC is in the process ofdeveloping an AE flight qualification program and leadership courses.5.6.  Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) Training.  CCATT training requirementsare  determined  by  the  manpower,  equipment,  and  force  packaging  (MEFPAK)  manager(AMC/SG)  and  the  CCATT  pilot  unit.    Training  includes  attendance  at  the  CCATT  formalcourse  at  Brooks  AFB.    Physicians  are  trained  in  advanced  cardiac  life  support  (ACLS)  andadvanced  trauma  life  support  (ATLS).    Critical  care  nurses  are  trained  in  ACLS  and  TraumaNurse  Core  Course  (TNCC).    Cardiopulmonary  technicians  are  trained  in  ACLS.    CCATTstraining  requirements  are  integrated  into  the  AE  system  through  membership  in  the  GAIN.Attendance in AECOT is required.5.7.  Professional Education.5.7.1.    Flight  nurses  are  licensed,  registered  nurses  with  a  variety  of  clinical  expertise.Trauma training and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training is highly recommendedfor all flight nurses in order to support our wartime mission.  All nurses are responsible forclinical competency, based on the AFSC-specific (46F and 46N) series core competency listapproved by the Director, AF Nursing Services.5.7.2.  Clinical training for FNs and AETs is governed by the Readiness Skills VerificationProgram and Career Field Education and Training Program (CFETP).  In addition, all AETsare certified as both an emergency medical technician (EMT) and BLS provider.5.8.  Currency Training.  To maintain currency, each AECM normally maintains requirementsestablished  IAW  AFI  11-301,  Aircrew  Life  Support  (ALS)  Program;  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,Aircrew  Training,  Volume  2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation  Program,  and  Volume  3,General Flight Rules; and AFI 11-2AE Volume 1, Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrew Training,and Volume 2, Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.  These include minimumnumber of flying hours, periodic written examinations and flight evaluations, maintenance of aAFTTP 3-42.5   1 NOVEMBER 2003                                   35current flight physical,  and periodic  completion of physiological training,  life  support,  groundegress, and medical equipment training.5.9.
