General.   This instruction provides flight examiners and aircrews with procedures and evaluationcriteria/tolerances to be used during flight evaluations as specified in AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standard-ization/Evaluation Program.  Specific areas for evaluation are prescribed to ensure an accurate assess-ment of the proficiency and capabilities of aircrews.  Evaluators use this AFI when conducting aircrewevaluations.  Instructors use this AFI when preparing aircrews for qualification.1.2.  Applicability.   This AFI is applicable to all individuals operating C-17 aircraft.  Copies should beavailable to all C-17 aircrew members.1.3.  Key Words Explained.1.3.1.  “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.1.3.2.  “Should” is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplish-ment.1.3.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.1.3.4.  “Note” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., that are considered essential to empha-size.1.4.  Deviations and Waivers.   Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI under normalcircumstances, except for safety or when necessary to protect the crew or aircraft from a situation not cov-ered by this AFI and immediate action is required.  Report deviations or exceptions without waiverthrough channels to MAJCOM standardization/evaluation function who in turn, notifies lead commandfor follow-on action, if necessary.1.4.1.  Waiver authority for the contents of this document is lead command, who in turn, delegatesMAJCOM/DO as waiver authority according to AFI 11-202V2, and the appropriate MAJCOM sup-plement.1.4.2.  MAJCOM/DOs forward a copy of approved long-term waivers to this instruction to lead com-mand for follow-on action, if required.1.5.  Supplements and Local Procedures.   This AFI is a basic directive.  Each user MAJCOM may sup-plement this AFI according to AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Procedures.  Limit supplement informationto unique requirements only.  MAJCOMs may specify unique evaluation items in their appropriate sup-plement (units use Chapter 4).  Supplements and local procedures will not be less restrictive than the pro-visions of this AFI or the appropriate flight manual.1.5.1.  Supplement Coordination Process.  Forward MAJCOM/DO-approved supplements, withattached AF Form 673, Request to Issue Publication, to lead command (HQ AMC/DO) for review.HQ AMC/DO will provide a recommendation and forward to HQ USAF/XOOT for approval (accord-ing to AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Procedures).  Use the following OPR's address: HQ AMC/DOV, 402 Scott Dr., Unit 3A1, Scott AFB IL, 62225-5302.  When supplements are published, providea final copy to HQ USAF/XOOT and lead command (HQ AMC/DOV).AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 200551.5.2.  If necessary, request and include approved long-term waivers to this AFI (including, approvalauthority, date, and expiration date) in the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.1.5.3.  Local Procedures Coordination.  Units send a copy of Chapter 4 to the appropriate NAF (ifapplicable) for coordination and approval.  If a NAF is not applicable, the unit will send a copy to theparent MAJCOM/DO for coordination and approval.  When local procedures are published, notify orsend a final copy to lead command, parent MAJCOM, and appropriate NAF, if applicable.1.6.  Requisition and Distribution Procedures.  Unit commanders may provide copies for all aircrewmembers and associated support personnel.1.7.  Improvement Recommendations.  Send comments and suggested improvements to this instructionon AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through Stan/Eval channels to HQAMC/DOV, 402 Scott Drive Unit 3A1, Scott AFB IL, 62225-5302 according to AFI 11-215, Flight Man-uals Program and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.1.8.  Evaluations.  This instruction establishes standardized instrument, qualification, mission, andinstructor evaluation criteria.  It also establishes the areas/subareas necessary for the successful comple-tion of evaluations, and identifies required areas/subareas that will be considered critical and/or non-criti-cal.1.9.  Evaluation Requirements.   Accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.  Each C-17crewmember will be evaluated at the frequency in AFI 11-202V2 and the appropriate MAJCOM supple-ment:1.9.1.  Instrument (INSTM) Evaluation.  All C-17 pilots will successfully complete initial and peri-odic instrument evaluations including the requisite instrument refresher course (IRC) and open-book,written instrument examination according to AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course Program,and an Aircrew Training Device (ATD)/flight evaluation.1.9.2.  Qualification (QUAL) Evaluation.  All C-17 aircrew members will successfully complete ini-tial and periodic qualification evaluations including the requisite open-book, closed-book, Boldfacewritten examinations, emergency procedures evaluation (EPE), and an ATD/flight evaluation.1.9.3.  Mission (MSN) Evaluations.  C-17 aircrew members will successfully complete initial andperiodic mission evaluations.  Mission evaluations should be as realistic as possible with a minimumof simulated events.1.9.4.  Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations.  To initially qualify as an instructor in the C-17, aircrew mem-bers will successfully complete an initial instructor qualification course and evaluation.  Subse-quently, aircrew members designated as instructors will be evaluated on their ability to instruct duringall periodic evaluations.1.9.5.  SPOT Evaluations.  A SPOT evaluation is an evaluation not intended to satisfy the require-ments of a periodic (i.e., INSTM, QUAL or MSN) evaluation.  SPOT evaluations have no specificrequisites or requirements unless specified in MAJCOM supplements.  See AFI 11-202V2 for optionsavailable to convert a SPOT evaluation to meet requirements of a periodic evaluation.1.9.6.  Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE).  See AFI 11-202V2 requirements and the follow-ing:  Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of emergency procedures and systems knowledge for6AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 2005all qualification and mission evaluations.  EPEs may be accomplished verbally, in-flight or in an Air-crew Training Device (ATD).1.9.6.1.  Units will develop and periodically update a list of EPE program requirements (topics,special interest items, etc.) in Chapter 4.  The EPE will include areas commensurate with theexaminee’s graduated training (e.g., initial, line, instructor, or evaluator) or as specified in AFI11-202V2 and MAJCOM Supplement.1.9.6.2.  Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight.  The examineemust be able to recite all Boldface items from memory and provide the initial steps of selectedemergency procedures that would not allow time for reference.  Units will provide a list of emer-gency procedures in Chapter 4.1.9.6.3.  Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified will be placed in supervised sta-tus until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed.  Examinees receivingan overall EPE grade of unqualified because of unsatisfactory Boldface procedures will not bepermitted to fly in their aircrew position until a successful re-evaluation is accomplished.  Accom-plish additional training according to requirements in AFI 11-202V2.1.9.7.  Evaluation Prefixes. Use AFI 11-202V2 evaluation prefixes for AF Form 8, Certificate of Air-crew Qualification.  Use “MSN” for the pilot airland evaluation, and “QUAL/MSN” for the load-master airland evaluation.  Identify unique mission type evaluation descriptions in parenthesis (e.g.MSN (AD), MSN (SOLL II), MSN (PNAF)).  For combined pilot airland and airdrop mission evalu-ations annotate as “MSN (AL-AD)”.  For combined loadmaster airland and airdrop evaluations anno-tate as “QUAL/MSN (AD)”.  Use the same annotation on the AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. 1.10.  Grading Policies.1.10.1.  The overall qualification level awarded an evaluation is based on performance during both theflight and ground phases.  This grade should be awarded only after all evaluation requirements havebeen completed and given due consideration.1.10.2.  To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must satisfy the criteria setforth for that evaluation and demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and/or equipment safely andeffectively during all phases of an evaluation.1.10.3.  Use the grading criteria in this instruction to grade areas/subareas accomplished during anevaluation.1.10.3.1.  The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in the general andspecific evaluation sections of this instruction.1.10.3.2.  The flight examiner may grade any area/subarea accomplished during an evaluation ifperformance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation accomplished or flight safety.1.10.4.  When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area may be verbally evalu-ated or evaluated in an ATD.  Flight examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areasin-flight before resorting to this provision.  When used, the evaluator will identify the area or itemswithin the area that were verbally evaluated on AF Form 8 as an examiner remark (following the mis-sion description).AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 200571.10.5.  Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.  Minor ormomentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action andsuch deviations do not jeopardize flight safety.  Consider cumulative deviations when determining theoverall grade.1.10.5.1.  For pilots only, if the flight manual recommends a specific airspeed range for perfor-mance of a maneuver, the flight examiner will apply the grading criteria to the upper and lowerlimits of that range.1.10.5.2.  Flight examiners will use sound judgement in the application of the grading criteria inthis instruction to determine the final grade.1.11.  Grading System.   NOTE: This paragraph for reference only and duplicates information in AFI11-202V2, allowing the evaluator a single-source instruction to conduct an evaluation.  When a conflictoccurs, use AFI 11-202V2.1.11.1.  Overall Qualification Levels.1.11.1.1.  Qualification Level 1 (Q-1).  The aircrew member demonstrated desired performanceand knowledge of procedures, equipment, and directives within tolerances specified in thisinstruction.  Qualification Level 1 will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted and may beawarded when discrepancies are noted if:1.11.1.1.1.  The discrepancies resulted in no more than a “Q-” grade being given in anyarea(s)/subarea(s).1.11.1.1.2.  In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude award-ing of an overall Qualification Level 1.1.11.1.1.3.  All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the debrief ofthat evaluation.1.11.1.2.  Qualification Level 2 (Q-2).  The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to performduties safely, but:1.11.1.2.1.  There were one (or more) area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training wasassigned.1.11.1.2.2.  A non-critical area/subarea grade of “U” was awarded.1.11.1.2.3.  In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on performancein one or more areas/subareas.1.11.1.3.  Qualification Level 3 (Q-3).  The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable levelof safety, performance or knowledge.1.11.1.3.1.  A grade of “U” awarded in a critical subarea/area requires an overall “Q-3” for theevaluation.1.11.1.3.2.  An overall “Q-3” can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight examiner, thereis justification based on performance in one or more areas/subareas.1.11.1.4.  The flight examiner will indicate all appropriate restriction(s) and additional training onthe AF Form 8.8AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 20051.11.2.  Area/Subarea Grades.  Areas/Subareas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U)grading system.  The overall area grade will be the lowest of any subarea grade awarded.1.11.2.1.  A “Q” is the desired level of performance.  The examinee demonstrated a satisfactoryknowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the prescribed tolerancesand accomplished the assigned mission.1.11.2.2.  A “Q-” indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area tasks, butrequires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner.  Deviations fromestablished standards must not exceed the prescribed “Q-” tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.1.11.2.3.  Assign a “U” area grade for any breach of flight discipline, performance outside allow-able parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/ tolerances that adversely affected mis-sion accomplishment or compromised flight safety.  An examinee receiving an area grade of “U”normally requires additional training.  When, in the judgment of the flight examiner, additionaltraining will not constructively improve examinee’s performance, it is not required.  In this case,the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief the examinee.1.11.3.  Boldface.  Grade Boldface either “Q” or “U.”1.11.4.  Critical Areas.  Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew member inorder to successfully achieve the mission objectives.  If an aircrew member receives an unqualifiedgrade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be unqualified.  Critical areasare identified by “(Critical)” in the area title and shading of Q- block on the AF Form 3862, AircrewEvaluation Worksheet (see examples at Attachment 2 and Attachment 3).1.12.  Unsatisfactory Performance.   NOTE: This paragraph for reference only and duplicates informa-tion in AFI 11-202V2, allowing the evaluator a single-source instruction to conduct the evaluation.  Whena conflict occurs, use AFI 11-202V2.1.12.1.  Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing to the examinee andapplicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.1.12.2.  Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline.  When an examinee jeopar-dizes safety of flight, the evaluator may assume the duties of that aircrew member.  This does notmean the flight examiner must assume the examinee’s position any time unsatisfactory performance isobserved.1.12.3.  Assign a qualification level of “Q-3” for unsatisfactory performance in any critical area/sub-area or if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties.1.12.4.  Immediately notify the examinee’s squadron commander/operations officer and flight com-mander, if available, when less than Q-1 performance is observed.1.12.5.  Unsatisfactory performance in a non-critical area/subarea will result in no higher than a qual-ification level “Q-2.”1.12.6.  Flight examiners observing unsatisfactory performance by a crewmember other than theexaminee (including one in a different crew position) will comply with the requirements in AFI11-202V2.AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 20051.13.  Conduct of Evaluations.91.13.1.  Flight examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, requirements of theevaluation, and all applicable evaluation criteria.  Flight examiners will then evaluate the examinee ineach graded area/subarea.1.13.1.1.  Flight examiners will normally not evaluate personnel they have primarily trained, rec-ommended for upgrade evaluation, or who render their effectiveness/performance reports.1.13.2.  Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any crew position/seat which will best enable the flight examiner to observe the examinee’s performance.1.13.3.  Note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and performance criteria duringthe evaluation.  Compare the examinee’s performance with the tolerances provided in the grading cri-teria and assign an appropriate grade for each area/subarea.1.13.3.1.  An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting substan-dard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.1.13.3.2.  The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202V2, C-17 ATScourseware, and this instruction will be the determining factors in assigning an overall grade.  Theflight examiner will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight.  During the critique, the flightexaminer will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area/subarea gradesassigned, and any additional training required.1.13.3.3.  In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the flight examiner will determine additionaltraining requirements.  Normally, additional training should not be accomplished on the sameflight.EXCEPTION:  Additional training on the same flight is allowed when unique situations present-ing valuable training opportunities (i.e., thunderstorm avoidance, crosswind landings) exist.  Thisoption requires utmost flight examiner discretion and judicious application.  When used, theexaminee must be informed of when the additional training begins and ends.1.13.3.4.  When evaluations are less than Q-1 performance, immediately notify the examinee’ssquadron commander/operations officer and flight commander (if available) according to AFI11-202V2.1.13.4.  The WST may be used to accomplish additional training and re-checks.  Areas for additionaltraining and re-checks should be limited to those areas/subareas that can be realistically accomplishedin the WST.1.13.5.  Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the one who admin-istered the original evaluation.1.14.  Use of AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet.   Units (normally OGV) will overprintAF Form 3862, using the examples at Attachment 2 or Attachment 3, to use as an evaluation worksheet.Copy each title, area number, and text (in the order illustrated), and shading to the appropriate blocks.Units may add special interest items and/or local evaluation requirements.  In-flight, use the worksheet toensure all required areas are evaluated.  Record positive and negative trend information and aircrew mem-ber’s performance.  File the worksheet or draft copy of the AF Form 8 in the aircrew member’s Flight10AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 2005Evaluation Folder (FEF) immediately after the flight evaluation as a temporary record of the evaluationresults.  Maintain until the finished AF Form 8 is added to the FEF, then discard.1.15.  Aircrew Testing.   See testing requirements in AFI 11-202V2 and include the following:1.15.1.  FTU Formal School Courses (Initial or Requalification): Complete an EOC exam and Bold-face, administered by the ATS contractor (CBT may be used).  Document EOC exam for AF Form 8as “Open/Close-book/EOC, Date completed, and the appropriate score.1.15.2.  For recurring evaluations, C-17 ATS phase training CBTs will satisfy open-book exam requi-site.  CBT questions should be treated as a Secure Question Bank (SQB) using the guidance in AFI11-202V2.  Document on AF Form 8 as Open-book/ATS, Date: Various, and Score: Comp.  A supple-mental open-book exam may be developed at the unit level to supplement the ATS exams to includethe latest local procedures, tactics, and MAJCOM/unit policy change.  Specify supplementalopen-book testing (including documentation on AF Form 8) requirements in the appropriate MAJ-COM supplement.1.15.3.  Closed Book Exam.  A closed book exam is a requisite for the periodic qualification (QUAL)evaluation.  Closed book questions will come from MDS-specific and local procedure MQFs.  Thesequestions will emphasize information and system knowledge necessary for safe flight and missionaccomplishment.  The basic exam will consist of 20 to 30 questions.  Additional questions commen-surate with the crewmember’s level of qualification (instructor/evaluator) and/or special mission qual-ifications (airdrop, SOLL II, PNAF, etc.) will be included in the closed book exam.  Complete aBoldface exam in conjunction with the closed book exam.  See crew member chapters for additionaltesting requirements.  15AF/DOV, 21AF/DOV, and 19AF/DOV  manage the C-17 MQF.1.15.4.  Instrument Exam. The instrument written exam will be accomplished during the 6-monthQUAL/INSTM eligibility period.  The C-17 Instrument Exam CBT satisfies written requirements ofthe Instrument Exam.  Document the exam completion on AF IMT 8 as INSTRUMENT, date com-pleted, and the appropriate score. 1.16.  Typical C-17 Evaluation Profile(s).   The unit will determine the evaluation profile(s) suitable forin-flight evaluations with unit OG/OGV approval (approval of the units’ flying schedule satisfies thisrequirement).  See specific aircrew chapters for enroute, SOLL II, and airdrop requirements.1.17.  Senior Officer Requirements.   See AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, and Chapter 2.AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 200511Chapter 2  PILOT EVALUATIONS2.1.  General.   This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and re-qualification evaluations, includingrequirements for instrument, qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations.  C-17 pilot evaluation pro-cess allow commander’s maximum flexibility.  The process is normally conducted in two phases; phaseone (called QUAL/INSTM) will qualify the pilot in the basic operation of the C-17 (normally completedat FTU).  Phase two (called MSN) adds the appropriate mission areas as a minimum for airland qualifica-tion.  Additional mission evaluation areas (Enroute, A/R, SOLL II, PNAF, etc) are added with unit com-mander approval.  See process specifics below:2.2.  Instrument Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Requalification). The C-17 instrument evaluationwill normally be conducted in the WST in conjunction with the qualification evaluation. Include all areasunder GENERAL and INSTRUMENT.  A minimum of three instrument approaches will be evaluated,with a minimum of one precision and one non-precision.” 2.2.1.  PAR may be evaluated verbally, if not available.2.2.2.  Flight pilots (FP), first pilots, and aircraft commanders accomplish CAT II ILS approaches andlandings from the left seat. Initial qualification evaluations require demonstration of a missedapproach and a landing.  Subsequent evaluations require one approach to either a missed approach orlanding. Copilots are evaluated on PNF duties during a CAT II approach to either a landing or missedapproach.  2.2.3.  Non-precision approaches are flown as either straight-in or as a circling approach. 2.3.  Qualification Evaluation (Initial, Periodic and Requalification).   Include all areas under GEN-ERAL and applicable areas under QUALIFICATION and INSTRUMENT.  Complete this evaluation isthe WST.  This evaluation is normally accomplished in combination with an instrument evaluation.2.3.1.  Co-Pilot.2.3.1.1.  From the right seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter and as illustrated on theevaluation worksheet example at Attachment 2.2.3.2.  Flight Pilot (FP)/First Pilot. 2.3.2.1.  From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated on the evalua-tion worksheet example at Attachment 2. First pilots are considered copilots who are airland mis-sion-qualified. NOTE: Evaluate flight pilots and first pilots on at least one approach and landing in both left and rightseats.  Initial First Pilot Qualification can be accomplished without a recurring instrument evaluation;however, a CAT II approach, missed approach, and landing must be evaluated from the left seat. Recur-ring First Pilot evaluations will be administered as a Qualification and Instrument evaluation. 2.3.3.  Aircraft Commander.2.3.3.1.  From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated on the evalua-tion worksheet example at Attachment 2.12AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 2005NOTES:1.  Evaluate aircraft commanders on at least one approach and landing in both left and right seats.2.  Instructor pilots (and flight examiners) may be evaluated in either seat, but do not require an approach and landing in both seats.2.3.4.  Pilot Senior Officer.2.3.4.1.  From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in GENERAL, QUALIFICATION andINSTRUMENT.  This evaluation consists of a variety of instrument approaches and VFR patterns.Abnormal configuration, simulated engine-out, right seat, and CAT II approach and landings arenot required.  This evaluation is normally completed in the aircraft.  Annotate AF Form 8 as aQUAL evaluation with expiration date, crew position is “FP”, and include a restriction in the com-ment section, “fly only under direct supervision of a qualified C-17 instructor pilot.”  See AFI11-202V1, Senior Officer Qualification and Performance Requirement, for additional informa-tion.  A qulaified C-17iInstructor pilot or above will be in the other seat.2.4.  Mission Evaluation (Initial, Periodic or Requalification).

This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and re-qualification evaluations, includingrequirements for qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations.3.2.  Qualification/Missions Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Requalification).   Include all areasunder GENERAL and QUALIFICATION/MISSION.3.2.1.  Initial and re-qualification evaluations:3.2.1.1.  The examinee will perform primary loadmaster duties during cargo upload, an en routesegment, and cargo download to complete the evaluation.3.2.1.2.  Initial qualification/mission evaluation profile requires a minimum of two mission legs toinclude a complete preflight, cargo onload, flight, offload, and postflight.3.2.1.3.  Initial qualification (QUAL) and initial mission (MSN) evaluations will be evaluated onsingle mission.  Upon successful completion of the initial qualification/mission evaluation, the AFForm 8 will indicate crew position as “ML”.  The loadmaster is qualified to perform unsupervisedloadmaster duties for “airland” (e.g., cargo/passenger).  Include an expiration date.3.2.2.  Periodic evaluations: Include all areas under GENERAL and QUALIFICATION/ MISSIONand the appropriate written exams.3.2.2.1.  If a periodic evaluation is combined with an airdrop evaluation, an airdrop platform maybe used for loading requirement.  If a load is not available for a periodic evaluation, cargo will bestatic loaded upon completion of the flight portion.3.2.2.2.  If both airland and airdrop periodic evaluations are successfully completed on the sameflight, use a single line entry under flight phase indicating “QUAL/MSN (AD)” and date. Use sep-arate line entries if more than one flight is necessary to complete the evaluation. 3.3.  Additional Mission Evaluations.3.3.1.  Airdrop. All initial, periodic and re-qualification evaluations will include all areas under GEN-ERAL and AIRDROP. Airdrop qualification requires unit commander approval.  Annotate on the AFIMT 8 under flight phase “MSN (AD)”. 3.3.1.1.  Initial.  Add an expiration date for reference only (C-17 qualification is based on theQUALIFICATION/MISSION evaluation expiration date). 3.3.1.2.  Examinee must perform all loadmaster duties for an initial airdrop evaluation.  Initial air-drop evaluations will include an actual sequential platform equipment airdrop.  (EXCEPTION:  A single platform airdrop may be substituted if the examinee demonstratessequential platform rigging.)  Other modes of aerial delivery will be evaluated verbally or byactual demonstration.3.3.1.3.  An airdrop sortie and evaluation may be credited if an unplanned no-drop is called aftercompletion of the Slowdown Checklist provided the no-drop was not due to loadmaster error.  Upto three airdrop evaluations may be administered (periodic-only) on the same flight/sortie pro-AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 200539vided each loadmaster performs an airdrop preflight, all required rigging, and in-flight airdropduties.  Evaluation will be conducted on heavy equipment sorties.3.3.2.  SOLL II (when MAJCOM-approved).  All initial, periodic and re-qualification evaluations willinclude all areas under GENERAL and SOLL II.3.3.2.1.  Initial and periodic SOLL II evaluation consists of onload and offload procedures, NVGoperations, special equipment and emergency procedures.  Complete the initial evaluation on anoperational mission or training exercise.3.3.2.2.  When evaluating a loadmaster for SOLL II qualification, annotate on the AF IMT 8 underflight phase “MSN (SOLL-II)”.  Add an expiration date for reference only (C-17 qualification isbased on the QUALIFICATION/MISSION evaluation expiration date). 3.3.3.  Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) (when MAJCOM-approved).  All initial, periodic andre-qualification evaluations will include all areas under GENERAL and MISSION area number30-34.  PNAF qualification requires unit commander approval.  Use the following:3.3.3.1.  Conduct initial PNAF evaluations on missions with actual or live munitions to the maxi-mum extent possible.  If the number of actual missions or mission segments are insufficient (i.e.,if waiting for an actual/live munitions mission(s) would adversely affect individual's upgrade orresult in an unacceptable upgrade delay for the unit), the initial evaluation may be conducted usingtraining or inert munitions.  If training or inert munitions are used, all aspects of the mission(including ground security and munitions personnel) must simulate actual or live munitions proce-dures.3.3.3.2.  When evaluating a loadmaster for PNAF qualification, annotate on the AF IMT 8 underflight phase “MSN (PNAF)”.  Add an expiration date for reference only (C-17 qualification isbased on the QUALIFICATION/MISSION evaluation expiration date). 3.3.3.3.  Flight examiners (not nuclear qualified) may give a spot evaluation or a N/N evaluationon a nuclear mission provided they meet security clearance requirements of the mission.  Escortflight examiners who are not certified under the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) according toAFI 11-299.  Flight examiners who do not maintain PNAF currency will not fly on mission legscarrying nuclear cargo unless they obtain ACM approval.3.4.  Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and  Re-qualification).  Flight examiners will placeparticular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and provide timely, effec-tive corrective action.  Include all areas under GENERAL, QUALIFICATION/ MISSION, andINSTRUCTOR (include areas under AIRDROP and/or SOLL II, if applicable).3.4.1.  To initially qualify as an instructor, the crew member must successfully complete a dedicatedinitial instructor evaluation.  Accomplish initial instructor evaluations during actual instructional mis-sions when possible.  When students are not available or mission requirements/crew compositionrequirements prevent inclusion of students, the flight examiner may serve as the student for the pur-pose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.3.4.2.  Loadmasters who desire to realign their QUALIFICATION/MISSION evaluation during theinitial instructor evaluation (update qualification expiration date) must complete all required writtenexaminations.40AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 20053.5.

This instruction applies to Air Forces Reserve Com-mand (AFRC) units and Air National Guard (ANG) units. SUMMARY OF REVISIONS   This change adds unique mission type evaluation descriptions to evaluation prefixes (paragraphs 1.9.7., 2.4.3., 2.4.4., 2.5.2.1., 2.5.3.2., 3.2.2.2., 3.3.1., 3.3.2.2., and 3.3.3.2.); updates AF IMT 8 documentation requirements for completion of the requisite Instrument exam (paragraph 1.15.4.); updates the minimum number of instrument approaches required during the Instrument Evaluation (paragraphs 2.2., and 2.12. Area 24 and Area 25); adds requirement for threat avoidance procedures during the Mission Evaluation (paragraphs 2.4.1., 2.4.2., 2.4.4., and 2.14. Subarea 32D); adds requirement for a tactical approach on Mission Evaluations (paragraphs 2.4.2., and 2.14. Subarea 31E); defines the minimum Assault Landing Zone size requirements for evaluations (paragraph 2.4.2.1.); adds requirement for a Full-Flap VFR approach and landing on Flight Pilot (FP) Mission Evaluations (paragraph 2.14. Subarea 31G); adds NVG evaluation criteria (paragraph 2.14. Subarea 31H and 31I); updates Special Operations Low-Level (SOLL II) evaluation criteria (paragraph 2.14. Area 39 and paragraph 3.11. Area 29).  A bar (|) indicates revision from the previous edition. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment. 1.9.7. Evaluation Prefixes. Use AFI 11-202V2 evaluation prefixes for AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.  Use “MSN” for the pilot airland evaluation, and “QUAL/MSN” for the loadmaster airland evaluation.  Identify unique mission type evaluation descriptions in parenthesis (e.g. MSN (AD), MSN (SOLL II), MSN (PNAF)).  For combined pilot airland and airdrop mission evaluations annotate as “MSN (AL-AD)”.  For combined loadmaster airland and airdrop evaluations annotate as “QUAL/MSN (AD)”.  Use the same annotation on the AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. 1.15.4. Instrument Exam. The instrument written exam will be accomplished during the 6-month QUAL/INSTM eligibility period.  The C-17 Instrument Exam CBT satisfies written requirements of the Instru-ment Exam.  Document the exam completion on AF IMT 8 as INSTRUMENT, date completed, and the appropriate score. 2.2. Instrument Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Requalification). The C-17 instrument evaluation will normally be conducted in the WST in conjunction with the qualification evaluation. Include all areas under GENERAL and INSTRUMENT.  A minimum of three instrument approaches will be evaluated, with a minimum of one precision and one non-precision.” 56AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 20052.2.2. Flight pilots (FP), first pilots, and aircraft commanders accomplish CAT II ILS approaches and landings from the left seat. Initial qualification evaluations require demonstration of a missed approach and a landing.  Subsequent evaluations require one approach to either a missed approach or landing. Copi-lots are evaluated on PNF duties during a CAT II approach to either a landing or missed approach.  2.2.3. Non-precision approaches are flown as either straight-in or as a circling approach. 2.3.2.  Flight Pilot (FP)/First Pilot. 2.3.2.1. From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated on the evaluation work-sheet example at Attachment 2. First pilots are considered copilots who are airland mission-qualified. NOTE: Evaluate flight pilots and first pilots on at least one approach and landing in both left and right seats.  Initial First Pilot Qualification can be accomplished without a recurring instrument evaluation; however, a CAT II approach, missed approach, and landing must be evaluated from the left seat. Recur-ring First Pilot evaluations will be administered as a Qualification and Instrument evaluation. 2.4.1. Flight Pilot (FP)/Copilot (CP) (Airland-Qualified). From the right seat (either seat for flight pilot) evaluate applicable MISSION Areas 29 through 34.  The evaluation profile will include aircraft preflight inspection, systems operations, low-level procedures, threat avoidance procedures, completion of applica-ble aircraft checklists, and the ability to safely takeoff, land, and fly the aircraft. Receiver air refueling areas may be verbally evaluated. 2.4.2. Aircraft Commander (AC) (Airland-Qualified). From the left seat (either seat for instructor or eval-uator) evaluate applicable MISSION Areas 29 through 34. The evaluation profile will include ground operations, visual low level, threat avoidance procedures, A/R procedures, and a tactical approach to a full flap landing on an Assault Landing Zone (ALZ). 2.4.2.1. ALZ Size Requirements.  The maximum size of the runway for the ALZ operations during the evaluation will be 5000’ by 100’, and marked IAW AFI 13-217.  At night, evaluations are authorized to a lighted landing zone no larger than 5000’ by 100’, and a touchdown zone no longer than 500’.  EXCEP-TION:  The OG/CC may approve, on a case-by-case basis, ALZ landings during the day to larger runways for recurring mission evaluations.  The runway will be clearly marked to identify the landing zone not larger than 5000’ by 100’, and a touchdown zone no longer than 500’.  Units will document on the AF IMT 8 that the OG/CC approved the ALZ operations to the said runway.  ALZ operations on all initial and requalification mission evaluations will be to an ALZ not larger than 5000’ by 100’. 2.4.3. Copilot (Airdrop-Qualified). From the right seat, evaluate MISSION Areas 29 through 36.  Evalu-ate the copilot's ability to perform aircraft preflight items, operate aircraft systems and complete  aircraft checklists during en route, low-level and airdrop segments. Evaluate the copilot's knowledge  of airdrop procedures and ability to fly in either a visual or SKE formation wing position. Evaluation  should consist of SKE and visual formation in both the lead and wing position. Formation air refueling  and receiver air refueling areas may be verbally evaluated. Annotate on the AF IMT 8 under flight phase “MSN (AD)”. 2.4.4.  Aircraft Commander (Airdrop-Qualified). From the left seat (either seat for instructor or evaluator) evaluate applicable MISSION Areas 29 through 36. The profile will include ground operations, formation procedures (departure, en route, low-level, threat avoidance, air refueling, and recovery), SKE and visual airdrop procedures.  Annotate on the AF IMT 8 under flight phase “MSN (AD)”. 2.5.1.  DELETED. 2.5.1.1.  DELETED. AFI11-2C-17V2   19 APRIL 2005572.5.1.2.  DELETED. 2.5.2.1.
