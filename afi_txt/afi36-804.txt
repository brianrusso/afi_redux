E. Certified by: HQ USAF/DPC (Mr John R. Graham)Cooney) Supersedes AFR 40-533, 23 March 1990.Pages: 10Distribution: FThis instruction implements AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements.  It establishes the require-ments for the appointment, reappointment, academic rank, award of tenure (if applicable), salary stepadjustment, and merit awards for professional civilian faculty members of the Air War College, Air Com-mand and Staff College, the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), and the United States Air ForceAcademy (USAFA).  It assigns responsibilities to Air Force components and provides the policy to be fol-lowed in implementing and maintaining the program.  These programs are authorized by Title 10, UnitedStates Code (U.S.C.), Section 9314 for AFIT and Section 9331 for USAFA.  Section 9021 of Public Law101-189 extended coverage to civilian faculty members of Air University (AU).  The Secretary of the AirForce, as delegated in this instruction, prescribes basic pay rates for civilian faculty members: Level IV ofthe Executive Schedule limits those rates.  This instruction does not apply to the United States Air ForceReserve or Title 5, United States Code, employees of the National Guard.  The Privacy Act of 1974affects this instruction.SUMMARY OF REVISIONSThis instruction adds policy guidance for USAFA civilian faculty members and deletes precedural guid-ance for AU civilian faculty members and delegates that responsibility to the AU Commander (AU/CC).1. Scope of Applicability and Authority. Sections 9314 and 9331(c) 10 U.S.C., and section 9021 10U.S.C., authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to employ as many civilians as faculty members as theSecretary considers necessary at the AFIT, USAFA, and AU.  All the laws, rules, regulations and proce-dures that apply to General Schedule (GS) and Senior Executive Service (SES) employees also apply tocivilian faculty members hired under this pay plan unless this instruction specifies otherwise.  The titles,duties, and pay of civilian faculty members should be similar to those in other Federal degree-conferringinstitutions.  Accomplish all personnel actions following equal employment opportunity guidelines;ensure equal opportunity regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, or handicapping con-dition.  This instruction applies to all civilian faculty members who the AU/CC or the USAFA Superin-tendent (SUPT) says are covered.2. Responsibility for Administration:2.1. Establishing Faculty Pay Schedules. The Director of Civilian Personnel Policy and PersonnelPlans (HQ USAF/DPC) with AU and USAFA input reviews the adequacy of the Faculty Pay Sched-ules.  The Director considers salaries at comparable Federal and non-Federal degree-conferring insti-tutions in order to establish pay schedules that are comparable to those of competing institutions.  TheDirector makes changes which reflect the annual adjustment to the GS using the methods provided inAttachment 1; the changes will be effective on the same date as the GS.  See Attachment 2 for asample pay schedule.2.1.1. Alternate Schedules. When disparity between the Faculty Pay Plan and pay at non-Fed-eral institutions exists, HQ USAF/DPC may establish alternate pay schedules to eliminate  com-petitive disadvantages.  Create alternate schedules by adding additional steps to the basic payschedule.2.1.1.1. Effective Date. The alternate schedule effective date is the beginning of the first payperiod after HQ USAF/DPC approves the schedule.  When academic disciplines are added toan existing alternate schedule, use the beginning of the first pay period after the discipline isapproved for inclusion on the schedule as the effective date.2.1.1.2. Termination of Alternate Schedules. When you no longer need a covered academicdiscipline, remove the discipline from the schedule and pay newly hired faculty membersusing the Faculty Pay Plan.  Current faculty members remain on the alternate schedule untiltheir current term of appointment ends.2.2. Delegation of Authority to Administer the Faculty Pay Plan. The Director of Civilian Per-sonnel Policy and Personnel Plans has delegated the Faculty Pay Plan administration to the AU Com-mander and to the USAFA Superintendent.  AU/CC and USAFA/SUPT will develop implementinginstructions.  AU/CC and USAFA/SUPT may delegate the authority to administer specific parts of thePlan.3. Duties and Titles of Faculty and Administrators:3.1. Civilian Faculty Members. Civilian faculty members hold one of four academic ranks:  Instruc-tor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor.  AU/CC and the SUPT establish duties forcivilian faculty members.  Civilian faculty members are paid from one of the steps on the appropriateFaculty Pay Schedule.3.2. Administrative Faculty. AU and USAFA may establish administrative faculty positions.Administrative faculty who are selected from the civilian faculty continue holding their previous fac-ulty status and may resume their regular faculty duties upon relinquishing their administrative facultyduties unless the member is relieved for cause.  Administrative faculty are paid from the Administra-tive Faculty Pay Schedule.3.3. Senior Managers. AU and USAFA may establish senior manager positions.  The laws, rules,and regulations applicable to the SES also apply to senior managers.  Senior managers are paid fromthe Senior Manager Pay Schedule.23.4. Other Academic Positions. AU and USAFA may establish other related academic positionssuch as visiting faculty, adjunct faculty, or physical education instructors.  The appropriate institutionassignes duties and responsibilities  and pays employees one of the approved pay schedules.4. Appointments. Select civilian faculty members using a competitive process.  The initial appointmentwill not normally exceed 3 years.  Promotions to higher academic rank does not affect the length of theterm of the current appointment.  Newly appointed employees are subject to a 1-year trial period at thediscretion of the Commander AU or the SUPT USAFA.  The SUPT or AU/CC may approve exceptionsto the competitive process when the exceptions are in the best interest of the Air Force.  Limit suchappointments to 1 year or less.5. Promotions. The AU and the USAFA establish a merit based promotion policy that includes achieve-ments in teaching, research, and service to the institution.6. Academic Rank. The AU/CC and the SUPT establish minimum performance, education, and experi-ence criteria for assignment or promotion to Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Profes-sor, Administrative Faculty, and Senior Manager positions.  These criteria must be consistent with thosein comparable Federal and non-Federal degree-conferring institutions.  The SUPT specifies academicrank criteria for physical education instructors at USAFA.7. Pay Setting:7.1. Initial Appointment. Determine starting salary based on an individual’s experience, academicrank, and academic discipline.7.2. Merit Pay Adjustments. Base pay adjustments upon the faculty member’s accomplishments.An individual may receive step increases and awards concurrently.7.3. Promotion in Academic Rank. A civilian faculty member will normally receive an increase oftwo salary steps when he or she is promoted from one academic rank to another.8. Academic Tenure. The AU/CC may establish procedures to grant academic tenure.  While tenure isnot normally granted at the time of initial appointment, you may make exceptions when the individualconcerned has exceptional qualifications.  The USAFA may not grant academic tenure.9. Duty Periods. The civilian faculty duty period is normally 12 months and will not be less than 10months.  A 10-month duty period at 10/12 of the 12-month salary or an 11-month duty period at 11/12 ofthe 12-month salary may be approved by AU/CC or the SUPT.10. Nonreappointment or Removal:10.1. Nonreappointment. AU/CC and the SUPT determine whether to renew the appointment of acivilian faculty member without academic tenure at their respective institutions.  If you do not renewan appointment, the affected faculty member will be notified in writing following the proceduresdeveloped by AU/CC and the SUPT.10.2. Advance Notice. A civilian faculty member should give at least 6 months’ notice of intention toresign or retire.310.3. Removal. Separate a civilian faculty member for cause in accordance with procedures con-tained in AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions (PA) (formerly AFR 40-750).11. Appeals and Grievances. To file a grievance or appeal, a faculty member uses:• AFI 36-1201, Discrimination Complaints (formerly AFR 40-1613).• AFI 36-1203, Appeal and Grievance Procedures (formerly AFR 40-771).• The Merit Systems Protection Board rules.• The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.12. Civilian Faculty Performance Appraisal. Once a year, supervisors evaluate all civilian facultymembers who are covered by this instruction.  EXCEPTION:  Those members who are serving in posi-tions for 120 days or less will not be evaluated.  See Attachment 3 for information on the Civilian FacultyPerformance Appraisal System.13. Benefits:13.1. Leave, Health Benefits, Life Insurance, and Retirement. Civilian members of the facultyare entitled to all regular civil service benefits such as annual leave, leave without pay (leave ofabsence), sick leave, health and life insurance, and retirement on the same basis as employees of thecompetitive civil service.  See the Federal Personnel Manual and applicable Air Force policy direc-tives and instructions for benefits.13.2. Leave for Professional Development. You may grant leave for professional developmentwhen the leave will contribute significantly to improving or furthering the mission of the institution.Applicants for such leave must present evidence that they plan to use the time for scholarly or profes-sional activities that will advance their professional standing and enrich their teaching upon return.13.2.1. Duty Assignment. Absence for professional development is a duty assignment and maybe authorized for up to 1 year.  The individual receives his or her regular salary and appropriatesupporting costs. The Air Force encourages gaining organizations to offset part or all of the costs.13.2.2. Faculty Responsibility. A faculty member who accepts such absence assumes an obliga-tion to continue to serve following his or her return to regular duty.  AU/CC or SUPT or their des-ignee determines the employees mandatory service obligation before releasing the employee fortraining or professional development. The faculty member must reimburse the Air Force fortuition and incidental expenses associated with the professional development if he or she fails tofulfill this obligation.13.2.3. Academic Degrees. Normally, the granting of leave for professional development maynot be used to pursue formal education for the sole purpose of obtaining an advanced degree.14. Long-Term Training and Education Program. Civilian members of the faculty are eligible to par-ticipate in the Air Force Long-Term Training and Education Program.  The program provides comprehen-sive training or education for employees who have significant changes in their responsibilities, or need thetraining to accomplish the Air Force mission.  Under this program, employees receive tuition, travel, perdiem (or transportation of dependents and household goods in lieu of per diem), and salary.  If the facultymember accepts this opportunity for training or education, he or she must complete a service agreement.4If the member does not fulfill this obligation, he or she must reimburse the Air Force for the tuition andincidental expenses associated with the education program.15. Classification, Titling, and Coding. OPM classification standards do not apply to employees whoare covered by this instruction since they fall under the exclusions of 5 U.S.C. 5102.  Modified core doc-uments reflect the academic rank, duties, performance standards, and responsibilities for each facultymember.  Record an employee’s status (for example, on SF 50B, Notification of Personnel Action) asfollows:15.1. Position Title and Number. Academic rank (for example, Professor, Associate Professor) ortitle (for example, Registrar, Head Coach, Director of Academic Affairs).  You may use a parentheti-cal title identifying the subject taught (for example, Professor (Electrical Engineering)).  Limit thetitle to 54 characters.15.2. Pay Plan. Administratively determined (AD).15.3. Numeric Designators. Numeric designators are not grades, but serve as identifiers for aca-demic rank or academic administrative positions.15.3.1. 21 - Instructor.15.3.2. 22 - Assistant Professor.15.3.3. 23 - Associate Professor.15.3.4. 24 - Professor.15.3.5. 25 - Administrative Faculty.15.3.6. 27 - School Deans.15.3.7. 28 - Director of Academic Affairs.15.4.

The Faculty Pay Plan is adjusted at the same time as the General Schedule (GS).Use the methods described in paragraph A1.2. to adjust the Faculty Pay Plan.  The schedule has 59 stepsfor Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, and Administrative Faculty; and nineadditional steps for Senior Administrators.  Additional steps may be added as required to form alternateschedules.A1.2. Schedule Computation. Steps 1, 17, 31, 53, 80, and 88 are linked with specific grades and steps inthe GS:A1.2.1. Give step 1 the same percentage increase as GS-7, step 1.A1.2.2. Give step 17 the same percentage increase as GS-11, step 3.A1.2.3. Set intervening steps between 1 and 17 by adding increments successively to step 1, with theincrement derived by dividing the difference between step 1 and step 17 by 16.A1.2.4. Give step 31 the same percentage increase as GS-12, step 6.A1.2.5. Intervening steps between 17 and 31 are derived in the same manner as those between steps1 and 17, except that the difference between steps 17 and 31 is divided by 14.A1.2.6. Give step 53 the same percentage increase as GS-15, step 3.A1.2.7. Intervening steps between 31 and 53 are derived in the same manner as those between steps1 and 17, except that the difference between steps 31 and 53 is divided by 22.A1.2.8. Steps 54 through 59 are an extrapolation of the line from steps 31 to 53.  That is, steps 54 to59 are derived by adding the same increment that was added for steps from 31 to 53.  To compute step54, add the increment to the new step 53.A1.2.9. (For Alternate Schedule Only) compute steps 60 and above by adding the same incrementthat was added for steps 54 through 59.A1.2.10. The Senior Administrator (steps 80 through 88) are derived as follows:A1.2.10.1. Grant step 80 the same percentage increase received by steps 54 and 55 combined.A1.2.10.2. Grant step 88 the same percentage increase as the SES increase.A1.2.10.3. Intervening steps between 80 and 88 are derived in the same manner as those betweensteps 1 and 17 except the divisor is 8.A1.2.11. U.S.C. 5308 limits the Faculty Pay Plan to salary rates that may not exceed the salary forlevel IV of the Executive Schedule; therefore, pay caps and salary ceilings imposed on the GS affectrates on this plan.6Attachment 2SAMPLE FACULTY PAY SCHEDULEFACULTY PAY PLAN:  1993Effective Date:  Beginning of first pay period on or after 1 Jan 93ST INSTR ST ASST PROF ST ASSOC PROF ST PROF ST ADMIN FAC ST SR MGR80 $86,33001 $27,100 07 $32,75781 88,62002 28,043 08 33,69903 28,986 09 34,64282 90,90983 93,19904 29,929 10 35,58505 30,871 11 36,52784 95,48985 97,77906 31,814 12 37,47086 100,06907 32,757 13 38,41308 33,699 14 39,35587 102,35909 34,642 15 40,29888 104,64910 35,585 16 41,24111 36,527 17 42,18412 37,470 18 43,21313 38,413 19 44,24314 39,355 20 45,27315 40,298 21 46,30316 42,241 22 47,33317 42,184 23 48,36318 43,213 24 49,39319 44,243 25 50,42320 45,273 26 51,45321 46,303 27 52,48322 47,333 28 53,51323 48,363 29 54,54324 49,393 30 55,57325 50,423 31 56,60326 51,453 32 57,85027 52,483 33 59,09734 60,34435 61,59025 50.423. 20 $45,27326 51,453 21 46,30327 52,483 22 47,33328 53,513 23 48,36329 54,543 24 49,39330 55,573 25 50,42331 56,603 26 51,45332 57,850 27 52,48333 59,097 28 53,51334 60,344 29 54,54335 61,590 30 55,57336 62,837 31 56,60337 64,084 32 57,85038 65,331 33 59,09739 66,578 34 60,34440 67,824 35 61,59041 69,071 36 62,83742 70,318 37 64,08443 71,565 38 65,33144 72,812 39 66,57845 74,059 40 67,82446 75,305 41 69,07147 76,552 42 70,31848 77,799 43 71,56549 79,046 44 72,81250 80,293 45 74,05951 81,539 46 75,30552 82,786 47 76,55253 84,033 48 77,79917 $42,18418 43,21319 44,24320 45,27321 46,30322 47,33323 48,36324 49,39325 50,42326 51,45327 52,48328 53,51329 54,54330 55,57331 56,60332 57,85033 59,09734 60,34435 61,59036 62,83737 64,08438 65,33139 66,57840 67,82441 69,07142 70,31843 71,56544 72,81245 74,059736 62,83754 85,280 49 79,04655 86,527 50 80,29356 87,774 51 81,52952 62,78653 84,03354 85,28055 86,52756 87,77457 89,02058 90,26759 91,5148Attachment 3CIVILIAN FACULTY PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL SYSTEMA3.1. Background. Supervisors will evaluate individual faculty in accordance with this instruction.A3.2. Operating Instructions. The AU/CC and the SUPTdevelop implementing instructions for theperformance appraisal system.A3.2.1. Definitions:A3.2.1.1. Civilian Faculty Performance Appraisal System. A system which identifies criticalperformance elements, establishes performance standards, communicates elements and standardsto individual faculty members, establishes performance appraisal procedures and methods, andguides the use of appraisal information in making personnel decisions.A3.2.1.2. Performance. Faculty members’ accomplishment of assigned duties and responsibili-ties.A3.2.1.3. Performance Element. Any major functional component of a position for which thefaculty member is held accountable and performance of which contributes meaningfully to suc-cess or failure in performing the duties of that position.A3.2.1.4. Performance Standards. Performance standards describe the expected level of com-petence of each performance element.A3.2.1.5. Performance Appraisal. Comparison, under an appraisal system, of performance ofduties and responsibilities with the established performance standards.A3.2.1.6. Progress Review. Review of the faculty member’s work progress during the appraisalperiod.  It requires discussion between the supervisor and faculty member regarding how well thefaculty member is achieving the established performance standards.  Supervisors will conductperiodic progress reviews and document them on AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief.A3.2.1.7. Rater. Immediate supervisor.A3.2.1.8. Reviewer. Normally the rater’s supervisor.A3.2.2. Performance Elements and Performance Standards:A3.2.2.1. The basic functions and responsibilities of a faculty member are teaching, research(scholarly and professional accomplishment), and service and administration.A3.2.2.2. All three functions are major job requirements and are considered critical to successfulperformance of the job.A3.2.2.3. The supervisor, with appropriate faculty consultation, determines standards for eachperformance element.  The standards reflect the individual’s assigned duties.A3.2.2.4. Write standards that define a successful level of accomplishment for each performanceelement.A3.2.2.5. The supervisor provides the faculty member a copy of his or her performance elementsand standards no later than 30 calendar days after the beginning of the rating period.  The supervi-sor may record the performance elements and standards on an AF Form 197, Air Force Institute9of Technology Faculty Performance Appraisal.  The supervisor and faculty member must dis-cuss performance expectations to make sure that each individual understands what is expected ofthe other.  The faculty member, the supervisor, and the reviewer must sign the form.  The facultymember’s signature indicates only that the performance elements and standards have beenreceived and discussed.  The supervisor or the faculty member may initiate a change in perfor-mance elements and standards during the rating period  Note: The employee must perform for atleast 90 days’ before he or she is appraised. The reviewer must approve a change substantiated bythe supervisor.  The change is then presented in writing and discussed with the faculty member.A3.2.3. Appraisals. Appraise all faculty members once a year, following the established perfor-mance standards and local instructions.A3.2.4. Levels of Performance:A3.2.4.1. The rater rates each performance element by marking the appropriate block:  "Did NotMeet" or "Met."A3.2.4.2. Use the following criteria to assign the overall performance rating which best describesthe employee’s overall performance:S - Successful.  This rating is assigned when the faculty member meets the requirements of all theelements of the work plan.M - Marginal.  This rating may be assigned when a faculty member does not meet the require-ments of an element and overall performance is acceptable.  The ratee must take prompt correctiveaction.U - Unacceptable.  Assign this rating when the faculty member does not meet the requirements ofan element and overall performance is unacceptable.10
