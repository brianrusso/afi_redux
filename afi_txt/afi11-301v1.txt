This  chapter  provides  guidance  to  assist  AFE  technicians  in  administering  key areas necessary for effective management of the AFE program. 3.2.  Budgeting. 3.2.1.  Each AFE section will prepare and submit an annual budget and/or financial plan to their unit CC.  (T-2) 3.2.1.1.  Each AFES/AFE COR should closely coordinate with their wing/group Resource Advisor  and  Financial  Management  offices  to  ensure  AFE  requirements  are  identified during various budget cycles.  (T-2) 3.3.  Supply Accounts. 3.3.1.  The OSS AFE section will establish its own supply account(s) IAW AFI 23-101, Air Force Materiel Management/AFMAN 23-122, Materiel Management Procedures.  (T-2) 3.3.2.  Ensure adequate number of equipment custodians are properly trained and appointed IAW AFI 23-101 and AFMAN 23-122 for both home station and deployed operations.  (T-3) 3.3.3.  Develop procedures to track supply, equipment and non-uniform item expenditures to provide quantitative requirements to the unit CC and resource manager to assist in and justify budgeting and funding requirements.  (T-3) 3.3.4.  Equipment Custodians will thoroughly review and accurately answer configuration data set questions provided by EAE annually as a minimum.  AFES/AFE COR/AFEO will validate all data sets and return signed data set(s) to EAE by their suspense date.  (T-2) 3.3.4.1.  Based on configuration data, each equipment custodian and NCOIC will provide an equipment assessment of AFE requirements by detail number, noun, NSN, authorizing AS,  number  authorized,  number  on-hand,  and  Basis  of  Issue  (BOI).    Coordinate assessments with AFES/AFE COR/AFEO through the SQ/CC responsible for the account.  AFES/AFE COR/AFEO will validate the assessment and direct adjustments, as required.  This process will keep equipment authorizations to minimum (authorized) levels to meet mission requirements.  (T-2) 3.3.5.  Ensure applicable Force Activity Designators (FAD) code is used when requisitioning flight equipment.  When ordering time-change items, use TEX Code 8 to by-pass base level stock (if remaining service-life is inadequate to meet mission needs).  Use advice code “2G” to ensure assets received from depot have the most service-life remaining on item. F-35 units will order items IAW program directives.  (T-2) 3.3.6.  Report time-change component requirements IAW TO 00-20-9 and HHQs directives.  AFRC associate units will provide information copies to their respective AFRC/A3RF.  (T-2) 3.3.6.1.  Ensure munitions account custodian submits their munitions forecast annually, using the Forecast and Allocation Module (FAM) of the Agile Munitions Support Tool located website https://www.my.af.mil/ammoprod/wm/.  If required, coordinate supplemental and out-Sustainment Combat at 784th Group 40 AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 of-cycle munitions changes, to the initial forecast, through the base MASO using the FAM. (T-2) 3.3.7.  Units will annually review appropriate AS to ensure current authorizations for unit-specific mission requirements IAW AFI 23-101 paragraph 5.4.4.  Equipment in excess of AS is not authorized.  (T-2) 3.3.7.1.  Use AS 016, AS 450, AS 538, AS 660, aircraft configuration instructions, mission requirements, LOGDET, AFEMS, MAJCOM/FOA specific guidance and this instruction to determine the basis of equipment required.  (T-2) 3.3.8.  AFE supply account representative(s) should monitor status of backorder requisitions and contact local Customer Support Liaison Element (LGRMCC) for items that have not been received within 180 days.  Provide LGRMCC with mission impact statement(s), as needed, in support of LGRMCC forwarding supply assistance request(s) to AFMC.  Provide information copies of supply difficulty and mission impact statement submissions and any supply status updates or responses to the AFES/AFE COR and NCOIC AFE QA.  Contract AFE units will forward a copy to their local quality assurance office.  (T-3) 3.3.8.1.  Supply  difficulty  and  mission  impact  letters  are  not  required  for  Custodian Authorization Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) items.  (T-3) 3.3.9.  Units will standardize supply account naming conventions by utilizing the following shop  codes:    FE  (Flight  Equipment)  for  O&M  SBSS  accounts;  FH  (Fly  Hour)  for  CPFH accounts; AC (Aircrew Chemical) for ACBRN accounts.  Units will work supply account name changes through their local customer support section.  (T-2) 3.3.10.  Spare Equipment.  Spare equipment is often required for maintenance and turn-around time for AFE.  Spare equipment, to include EAID reportable (e.g. CA/CRL items), and non-accountable (e.g. expendable items), are authorized as follows (T-2): 3.3.10.1.  Spare  Set  Authorization.    Equipment  set  quantity,  per  set,  is  determined  by specific  AFI  11-2MDS  Vol  3,  Addenda  or  AFI  11-301  Vol  2.    AFE  may  possess  and maintain one spare set of equipment (e.g. survival vests, life rafts, etc.) per 10 aircraft possessed (Total Aircraft Inventory), with a minimum of one spare set for units with less than 10 aircraft possessed.  Units may adjust their total spare set quantity downward to best suit unit needs or if other MAJCOM/FOA guidance exists, (i.e. C-17A raft spare sets are determined  by  HQ  AMC  and  Special  Purpose  Recoverables  Authorized  Maintenance [SPRAM] account authorizations). 3.3.10.1.1.  If EAID reportable items are contained within the set, use the higher-level assembly  AS  configuration  code/configuration  description  and  BOI  to  determine authorizations (e.g. radios installed in survival vests, life raft containers, etc.).  (T-2) 3.3.10.1.2.  Any EAID reportable items contained within spare sets will be considered Use  Code  B,  base  support,  under  AS450AOOB  (CAF),  AS450EOOB  (MAF)  and AS660NKAV.  (T-2) 3.3.10.2.  Additional  10  Percent  Spares  Authorization.    Some  items  may  require  an additional 10 percent spares authorization due to the nature of the equipment maintenance concept, depot level repair, or individual issued items (e.g. radio sets, ACBRN items, etc.).  In  cases  where  equipment  is  built  in  sets,  the  additional  10  percent  authorization  is  in AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 41 addition to the spare sets.  Example: An unserviceable radio is removed from a survival vest.  It has to be sent to Depot for repair but the survival vest needs immediate radio replacement to remain serviceable.  The stand-alone 10 percent radio authorization in this example enables immediate replacement/serviceability.  (T-2) 3.3.10.2.1.  When  authorized,  the  additional  10  percent  authorization  is  calculated against the total BOI calculation.  When figuring the additional 10 percent authorization for items contained in sets, add the BOI authorization, plus spare set authorization(s), and then calculate the 10 percent authorization.  (T-2) 3.3.10.2.2.  For EAID reportable items, the additional 10 percent authorization may only be cited if the AS (e.g. AS450*, AS660NK*) provides the specific configuration code for maintenance and inspection for the NSN being calculated.  The AS450 and AS660 configuration codes for the additional 10 percent authorization will be unique for each affected NSN.  (T-2) 3.3.10.3.  Mobility  Equipment.   Mobility  equipment,  EAID  reportable  and  non-accountable, is authorized and calculated by specified UTC and NSN (or stock class), as determined  by  UTC  pilot  and  non-pilot  units,  with  coordination  of  the  responsible MAJCOM/FOA IAW AFI 10-401. 3.3.10.3.1.  EAID reportable items for mobility are considered Use Code A, Mobility, and must be on hand or on requisition.  Units will cite the appropriate configuration code and configuration description in the mobility sections of AS (e.g. AS450AOOA [CAF],  AS450EOOA  [MAF],  AS660NKAU).    Mobility  equipment  does  not  count against or as additional 10 percent authorization.  (T-2) 3.3.10.3.2.  An additional 10 percent spares is not authorized for mobility equipment.  UTC pilot and non-pilot units, with coordination of the responsible MAJCOM/FOA, determine the specific BOI quantities required for mobility by specific UTC and NSN.  (T-2) 3.3.10.3.3.  UTC pilot units will ensure EAID reportable NSN authorizations as stated in the AS match the UTC LOGDET data.  Since LOGDET data is by NSN, items like radios may or may not match the quantities of survival vests and rafts contained in the UTC LOGDET.  (T-2) 3.3.10.3.4.  If EAID reportable equipment BOI authorizations has stated the AS are deemed incorrect when comparing the UTC LOGDET data, the UTC pilot unit will coordinate with the responsible MAJCOM/FOA to request guidance on changing or correcting the AS in AFEMS.  (T-2) 3.3.11.  Classic  associate  and  active  associate  TFIA  AFE  sections  will  use  the  following business rules for managing equipment EAID reportable equipment (T-2) 3.3.11.1.  The host AFE (i.e. the unit that owns the aircraft) will manage and account for all EAID reportable items with the exception of EAID reportable ACBRN D-Bag items. 3.3.11.2.  The host unit and associate AFE will maintain EAID reportable ACBRN D-Bag items on separate CA/CRLs.  (T-2) 3.3.12.  Aircraft installed EAID reportable equipment. 42 AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 3.3.12.1.  Due to the nature of the way large frame aircraft (LFA) deploy and or transition through  areas  of  responsibility,  aircraft  installed  flight  equipment,  to  include  EAID reportable equipment, will not be put into deployed or transferred status.  (T-2) 3.3.12.2.  Accountability  of  aircraft  installed  EAID  reportable  equipment  is  actively managed and properly documented using the AFTO Form 46.  (T-2) 3.4.  Air Force Cost Analysis Improvement Group/Cost Per Flying Hour (AFCAIG/CPFH) Program. 3.4.1.

To purchase these items, use EEIC 644 for Materiel Support Division (MSD) items, EEIC 605 for General Support Division (GSD) items, and EEIC 61952 for Government Purchase Card (GPC) items.  Units should use the most recent FY  standardized  CPFH  RC/CC  and  PFMR/ORG  codes  applicable  to  their  unit.    Centrally managed and accountable support equipment items are not funded through the CPFH program.  (T-0)  Note:  Flight Test Squadrons (Depot Support) utilize CSAG funding.  (T-1) 3.4.2.  AFE  and  A4  AFCAIG/CPFH  managers  will  identify  and  define,  (by  decision-tree method), total APP AFCAIG/CPFH requirements for each MDS aircraft configuration.  Items not passing the decision-tree method for AFCAIG/CPFH AFE funding will be considered non-fly items.  (T-1) 3.5.  Equipment Redistribution. 3.5.1.  In the event AFE becomes excess to organizational needs, the AFES/AFE COR will notify respective MAJCOM/FOA for possible redistribution prior to turn-in. (T-2) 3.5.2.  Once notification is made, disposition instructions (redistribution, turn-in, etc.) will be provided  to  the  unit  within  30  calendar  days.    AFES/AFE  COR  will  notify  their MAJCOM/FOA when they have unserviceable flight equipment, which can be used as training equipment.  (T-2) 3.6.  Transfer of Flight Equipment. 3.6.1.  During  aircraft  transfers  or  movement  of  flight  equipment,  communication  between depot,  modification  agencies,  and  gaining  or  losing  units  is  required.    Comply  with  the instructions in AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting, and TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance General Policies and Procedures.  (T-2) 3.6.2.

(T-2) AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 67 Chapter 7 AIRCREW LASER EYE PROTECTION PROGRAM 7.1.  Introduction. 7.1.1.  Protecting  aircrew  from  harmful  lasers  is  a  complex  problem  involving  science, intelligence and medicine in the context of an operational scenario.  There are numerous factors that must be considered as part of developmental requirements such as:  compatibility with different  aircraft  cockpit  displays,  type  mission,  headgear,  night  vision  devices,  vision correction,  device  weight,  field  of  view  and  other  human  system  integration  issues.    An effective program requires a general understanding of laser threats, inherent system hazards, and  a  coordinated  interaction  between  medical,  laser  safety  experts  (bioenvironmental engineers or health physicists), Intelligence, aircrew and AFE technicians. 7.1.2.  Laser Threat.  Aggressive foreign laser development, availability of low cost hazardous COTS devices, growing number of our own laser designators, range finders and hand held pointers continues to increase the chance of exposure.  In 1995, Vienna Protocol IV to the 1980 Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of  Certain  Conventional  Weapons  was  drafted,  banning  use  and  transfer  of  laser  weapons whose primary purpose is to permanently blind.  Although Protocol IV  may be viewed as successful in prohibiting use and transfer of a specific category of anti-personnel weapon, we must prepare for inadvertent exposure and enemies who may not abide by such protocols.  For these reasons, the AF approved an ALEP Operational Requirements Document in 1996 to begin formal development and acquisition programs. 7.1.3.  Laser Hazard.  LASER is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.  Lasers produce a coherent intense beam of light and under certain circumstances; exposure can result in damage to the human eye or skin.  The human eye is most vulnerable to injury from lasers in the visible region (400-700nm wavelengths), but are also vulnerable to longer wavelengths of invisible lasers in the near infrared region (700-1100nm) and shorter wavelengths in the ultra-violet region. 7.1.3.1.  Lasers  may  damage  human  eyes  at  ranges  up  to  several  miles  and  cause  a “dazzling” effect at even greater distances (particularly at night).  Dazzling occurs when laser  light  hitting  a  windscreen  refracts  and  reflects  illuminating  the  cockpit  causing possible flash blindness resulting in the inability of aircrew to perform their mission. 7.1.3.2.  Laser light entering an aircraft cockpit presents a potential hazard to aircrew not wearing appropriate Laser eye protection. 7.2.  Acquisition Strategy. 7.2.1.  HQ Air Combat Command (ACC) is the LC for acquisition of ALEP.  ACC/A5AL task MAJCOM  AFE  functional  managers  to  report  command  requirements  for  ALEP  devices.  Aggregate requirements are established and requisitions are programmed to fill unit demands.  The acquisition strategy for ALEP is the evolutionary acquisition approach.  In this process, a desired  capability  is  identified  and  threshold  objectives  are  refined  through  controlled technological demonstrations and risk management with continuous user feedback. 68 AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 increment  of  development  provides 7.2.2.  Each improved  capability.  Requirements  for  future  increments  depend  on  user  feedback,  threat  assessments  and technological maturity.  The approving authority for use of all ALEP devices is referenced in AFI 48-139. the  user  an 7.3.  Information/Asset Security. 7.3.1.  Information  disclosing  specific  characteristics  of  ALEP  devices  is  classified  IAW provisions  of  the  ALEP  Security  Classification  Guide  (AFLCMC/WNUV,  1981  Monahan Way, WPAFB AFB, OH  45433-7217, telephone COM (937) 938-3157 or DSN 798-3157). 7.3.2.  Requests  for  information  defining  specific  characteristics  of  ALEP  devices  will  be directed to HQ ACC, Flight Operations and Training Branch (ACC/A3TO),  Langley AFB Virginia. (T-2) 7.4.  ALEP Program Responsibilities. 7.4.1.  IAW  AFI  48-139,  the  installation  CC  will  designate,  in  writing,  a  qualified Bioenvironmental Engineer (AFSC: 43E3X) or equivalent civilian to serve as the Installation Laser Safety Officer (ILSO).  If a qualified 43E3X or equivalent civilian is not assigned, a 7-level or higher Bioenvironmental Engineering Technician (AFSC: 4B0X1) may be designated to serve as the ILSO with approval from the Command Bioenvironmental Engineer.  If the base wing is located on a non-AF led joint base, overall ILSO responsibilities would fall to the host unit per the host service's guidelines.  If the host does not assign an ILSO, the AF Wing CC must designate a Wing LSO to execute ILSO responsibilities for Wing-owned personnel and operations.  If the host assigns one, designation of an AF Wing LSO is optional.  (T-2) 7.4.2.  ILSO.  AFI 48-139 specifies any facility using Class 3B, Class 4 lasers, or laser systems to designate an ILSO to oversee safety for all operational, maintenance and servicing units.  (T-2) 7.4.2.1.  Is  responsible  for  establishing  an  installation  laser  and  optical  radiation  safety program and ensuring all technicians exposed to hand held lasers, or have a requirement to wear ALEP, receive the appropriate level of laser training IAW AFI 48-139.  (T-2) 7.4.2.2.  Will train unit technicians on hazards surrounding an active laser and appropriate safety equipment available for use when working around or handling an active Laser. 7.4.2.3.  In an environment where exposure is possible, ILSO duties and responsibilities may be assumed by the AFEO.  (T-2) 7.4.2.4.  Will comply with all ILSO duties and responsibilities assigned IAW AFI 48-139. 7.4.2.5.  Consult USAFSAM/OE for further information on ILSO training resources. 7.4.3.  AFE personnel.  (T-2) 7.4.3.1.  Will  fit,  inspect,  maintain  and  train  aircrew  on  proper  use  of  laser  protective devices  defined  in  this  instruction.  Training  will  be  accomplished  in  conjunction  with LL06. (T-2) 7.4.4.  Aerospace Medicine (AM). AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 69 7.4.4.1.  Local  AM  personnel, in  concert  with  Optometrists,  Ophthalmologists, Physiologists  and/or  Bioenvironmental  Engineers  will  ensure  aircrew  members  are familiar with different effects lasers have on the eye.  (T-2) 7.4.4.2.  AM personnel will perform laser eye examinations for aircrew as outlined in AFI 48-139.  (T-2) 7.4.4.3.  Optometrists  will  ensure  refractive  ALEP  devices  meet  individual  corrective vision specifications and are properly fitted.  (T-2) 7.4.5.  Intelligence. 7.4.5.1.  Unit Intelligence personnel will ensure aircrew are briefed on potential laser threat types, locations, and current threat assessment data during mission profile briefings.  (T-2) 7.4.5.2.  Will ensure adequate procedures are in place to capture and promptly disseminate reported incidents of laser exposure involving aircrew.  (T-2) 7.4.6.  Air Force Safety Center  . 7.4.6.1.  As chairs of the AF Laser System Safety Review Board (LSSRB), AFSEC reviews CONOPS,  TTPs  for  operational  laser  devices  and  associated  use  of  ALEP,  providing guidance as necessary.  ALEP use is part of the LSSRB review process ultimately leading to AF Safety certification for lasers, as required by AFI 48-139.  (T-2) 7.5.  Operational Use of ALEP. 7.5.1.  ALEP should be worn when there is any risk of a laser exposure.  Based on the threat environment,  local  CC’s  have  discretionary  control  over  ALEP  wear  policy  for  their subordinates.  When ALEP is worn together with NVDs, aircrews are advised to perform a preflight and sight adjustment wearing both.  This preflight/adjustment will ensure any changes to visual acuity are identified before flight.  (T-2) 7.5.2.  Medical Examination.  Aircrew or technicians who operate in an environment where they  could  be  exposed  to  Class  3B  or  4  lasers  are  required  to  get  a  prescreening  eye examination.  This examination will document the condition of the eye before working in the laser environment.  A comparative examination will be conducted upon termination of duties.  (T-2) 7.5.3.  Selecting appropriate ALEP.  ALEP is designed to protect aircrew from specific laser irradiation transmitted at visible and invisible wavelengths.  Incorrect usage or subjecting laser protective devices to conditions outside specific design capabilities will result in a degradation of performance and potential risk of exposure to harmful laser energy.  When selecting an ALEP device consider the following criteria: 7.5.4.  Laser Threat.  Unit intelligence personnel will provide aircrew information on known laser threats in the current theater of operation.  Aircrew will pass that information to AFE, who in-turn will select a laser protective device that may be capable of countering the threat.  (T-2) 7.5.4.1.  Types  of  ALEP.    AFE  technicians  should  provide  aircrew  information  on  the protective  characteristics  of  ALEP  available  for  use.    Specific  wavelength  protection offered by each device is classified and available upon request from ACC/A3TO, DSN 70 AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 574-3063.  Further information about ALEP is available at the Eye Protection Task Force SIPRNET site. 7.5.4.2.  Side  Protection.    Some  ALEP  devices  are  available  with  and  without  side protection.  ALEP with side protection is required when employing hand held laser pointers in the aircraft to prevent exposure to reflective energy.  Side protection should also be employed when wearing NVDs.  Although NVDs provide a level of laser eye protection from exposures along the axis of the eye, without the proper side protection given by the approved ALEP, there is a chance of incurring an off-axis exposure. 7.5.5.  Suspected Laser Exposure.  Aircrew who suspect exposure to laser radiation from either friendly or hostile sources will report to the AM flight or nearest emergency room where an appropriate medical provider immediately upon landing can examine the individual.  The AM flight will manage and coordinate the event with the MAJCOM, USAFSAM, 77th AESG/YA and the Tri-Service Laser Injury Hotline as directed by AFI 48-139.  More information about historical  incidents  and  exposure  reporting  procedures  is  available  on  the  SIPRNET  at:  http:\www.naic.wrightpatterson.af.smil.mil/DEW/LE/index.html. 7.5.5.1.  If exposure comes from a friendly source, the mishap will also be reported through appropriate  safety  channels,  and  if  required,  documented  in  the  Air  Force  Safety Automation System.  Consult AFI 91-204 for further guidance. 7.5.6.  Initial Response.  When encountering laser illumination, aircrew should not stare at the laser source, but transition to aircraft instruments and turn away from the threat.  Aircrews should  recognize  the  laser  might  be  associated  with  a  weapon  posing  a  greater  threat  and initiate appropriate evasive action.  If a laser threat exists in vicinity of an airfield of intended arrival or departure, ALEP devices should be donned prior to descent from cruise altitude, or prior to takeoff.  Doffing of ALEP devices after departing a defined laser threat area or after landing  is  left  to  discretion  of  the  AC.    The  following  procedures  should  be  implemented immediately following suspected laser exposure. 7.5.6.1.  Look away from laser source; do not remove night vision goggles. 7.5.6.2.  Transition to aircraft instruments. 7.5.6.3.  In a multi-seat aircraft, if exposed pilot is flying the aircraft, transfer control to unaffected pilot. 7.5.6.4.  Assess  visual  functionality.    If  visual  disturbance  persists  for  more  than  60 seconds, declare in-flight emergency and return to base as soon as practical. 7.5.6.5.  Notify Command and Control of suspected laser incident. 7.5.6.6.  Avoid rubbing eyes as corneal scratches can result. 7.5.6.7.  If  vision  returns  to  normal  and  there  is  no  pain  within  3-5  minutes,  AC  will consider the value of continuing the mission against potential loss of an aircrew member who may have sustained eye damage.  The AC will determine whether to terminate the mission. 7.5.6.8.  Upon return to base, accomplish intelligence debrief and report suspected laser exposure at:  http:\www.naic.wrightpatterson.af.smil.mil/DEW/LE/index.html. procedures incidents IAW AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 71 7.5.6.9.

Aircrew Eye/Respiratory Protection (AERP)— AERP is designed to protect the crewmember head, neck, face, eyes, and respiratory tract in a CBRN environment.  This equipment is designed to  provide  protection  may  impose  operational  or  physiological  burdens,  degrading  mission capability, or combat effectiveness. Flight Equipment— Flight equipment encompasses all equipment that was formerly known as aircrew life support equipment, and is part of the 412A life support system. Chemical Threat Area (CTA)— An area that may be subject to attack with chemical warfare agents from a number of sources. Contracting  Officer  Representative  (COR)—The  AFE  COR  is  synonymous  with  AFEO  or AFES  when  directly  responsible  for  the  oversight  of  AFE  sections.    This  term  is  not  to  be misrepresented  by  applying  it  to  any  other  CORs  aligned  outside  the  scope  of  AFE  section management (e.g. Mission Support Group functions, or other contract managed workcenters). D—Bag - Full complement of ACBRN equipment BOI.  Includes the contents of the D-1 bag, plus any remaining BOI items. D-1 Bag— One complete ACBRN equipment carried by aircrew when deploying to chemical threat environment. Detected Safety Violation (DSV)— A DSV is an unsafe act by an individual.  The inspector must stop the unsafe act immediately.  Do not document a separate DSV on an individual undergoing a AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 85 PE since the unsafe act automatically results in a "Fail" rating on the PE.  Use the word "Safety" when a safety violation is committed during a PE. In—Process Inspection (IPI) - An additional inspection or verification step at a critical point in the installation, assembly, or reassembly of a system, subsystem or component. These inspections are  either  TO,  MAJCOM,  or  locally  directed  and  are  accomplished  by  qualified  technicians designated by the unit CC via appointment letter, or as determined by applicable MAJCOM/FOA.  The term IPI is the same as Critical Point Inspection and/or Rigger Check as found in various different service manuals and will be the only term used on all inspection sheets. Laser— An acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.  Any device that can be made to produce or amplify electromagnetic radiation in the x-ray, UV, visible, and infrared or other portions of the spectrum by the process of controlled stimulated emission of photons.

Locally Designed Tool— A tool designed, manufactured or modified without approved guidance from an official source (e.g. TO, TCTO, COTS manual). Logistics  Detail  (LOGDET)—  The  LOGDET  defines  standard  passenger  and  equipment movement requirements for each UTC.  Equipment detail is provided at the NSN level.  Lists all material in an UTC, prioritizes increment movement, provides increment characteristics, and is the standard equipment listing for planning. Major  Discrepancy/Finding—  A  major  discrepancy  is  defined  as  a  condition  that  would endanger personnel, jeopardize equipment or system reliability, impact safety of flight or warrant discontinuing  the  process  or  equipment  inspection.    Any  major  discrepancy  will  result  in  an automatic inspection failure.  All discrepancies will be documented for trends. Minor Discrepancy/Finding— A minor discrepancy is defined as an unsatisfactory condition that requires repair or correction, but does not endanger personnel, impact safety of flight, jeopardize equipment  reliability  or  warrant  discontinuing  a  process  or  equipment  operation.    A  minor discrepancy is one that will not affect the operation of the equipment but prevents the equipment from being 100 percent compliant with current directives.  All discrepancies will be documented for trends. Newly Assigned— A technician /NCOIC new to the unit by way of PCS, new hire or changing MDS, etc. Nomex®—  Nomex®  fabric  is  a  high-temperature  resistant  and  inherently  flame  retardant synthetic fabric with no-hot-melt point or drip characteristics.  The fabric is light in weight, will not support combustion, but will begin to char at 700° to 800° F.  The fabric has good abrasion resistance similar to nylon and is nonabsorbent like nylon and other synthetic fabrics. Operational Support Crewmember— Personnel on flying status but not occupying a UMD ―A‖ prefix position. Operation Plan (OPLAN) (DoD)— Any plan, except for the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), for the conduct of military operations.  Plans are prepared by combatant CC’s in response to requirements established by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and by CC’s of subordinate 86 AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 commands  in  response  to  requirements  tasked  by  the  establishing  unified  CC.    An  OPLAN identifies  the  forces  and  supplies  required  to  execute  the  CINC's  Strategic  Concept  and  a movement schedule of these resources to the theater of operations.  The forces and supplies are identified  in  Time-Phased  Force  Deployment  Data  (TPFDD)  files.    OPLANs  will  include  all phases of the tasked operation.  The plan is prepared with the appropriate annexes, appendixes, and TPFDD files as described in the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System manuals containing planning policies, procedures, and formats.  OPLANs are prepared either in a complete format OPLAN or as a Concept Plan (CONPLAN).  The CONPLAN can be published with or without a TPFDD file.  An OPLAN for the conduct of joint operations that can be used as a basis for development of an Operation Order (OPORD). Overwater Flight— Any flight taking off or landing over water, exceeding power-off glide or auto-rotational distance from land. Passenger (PAX)— Individual aboard aircraft for the purpose of transportation. Pilot Unit—Unit designated by the MAJCOM functional manager (MFM) to handle LOGDET management responsibilities for an UTC.  Pilot units are listed in the header record of each UTC and LOGDET. Personnel Evaluation (PE)— A PE is an over-the-shoulder (direct or indirect) evaluation of a maintenance  action  or  inspection  by  an  individual  or  team  as  part  of  the  Quality  Assurance Program or SA program.  Use PEs to evaluate job proficiency, degree of training and compliance with TOs.  A PE may consist of a full or partial evaluation of the maintenance action or inspection being performed. Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI) (DoD)— The aircraft assigned to meet the primary aircraft authorization, also called PAI. Primary Crewmember— Any person, rated or nonrated, and required on aircraft to accomplish flying mission. Specialty Training Standard (STS)— An AF publication that describes an AFS in terms of tasks and knowledge an Airman in that specialty may be expected to perform or to know on the job.  Also identifies the training provided to achieve a 3, 5, or 7 skill level within an enlisted AFS.  It further serves as a contract between AETC and the functional user to show which of the overall training requirements for an AFSC are taught in formal schools and correspondence courses. Task Evaluation (TE)— A TE is an over-the-shoulder direct evaluation of a maintenance action or inspection, from start to finish, by an individual or team who is in upgrade or qualification training  and  NOT  currently  task  qualified  on  the  task(s).    TEs  are  also  utilized  during  initial upgrade training to ensure the AFE technician is at the CFETP defined “GO” level, and can be task qualified in their TBA ITP record. Technical  Data  Violation  (TDV)—  A  TDV  is  an  observation  of  any  person  performing maintenance without the proper technical data available, available but not in use or not following the correct sequence of steps (if directed).  The technician must have knowledge of all general directives  associated  with  the  job  prior  to  performing  the  task.    However,  those  directives applicable to the task being performed must be present at the job site.  Do not document a separate TDV on an individual undergoing a PE, since failure to use technical data automatically results in a "Fail" rating. AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 87 Theater (DoD)— The geographical area outside the continental United States for which a CC of a combatant command has been assigned responsibility. Two—Person Concept - Is designed and used throughout all IPIs to ensure both the 1P0X1 flight equipment inspector, and the IPI qualified 1P071, are both present and in constant view of each other during the IPI step.  Enforce the Two-Person Concept until the IPI step is complete, at which point  the  individual  flight  equipment  inspector  continues  with  the  inspection  without  the  IPI qualified 1P071 present. Unit Manpower Document (UMD)— A detailed staffing list reflecting the distribution of staffing allocations into a finite structure of authorizations (by work center). Unit Type Code (UTC)— A five-character, alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each type unit of the Armed Forces. Unsatisfactory Condition Reports (UCR)— A UCR is an unsafe or unsatisfactory condition, other than a DSV, chargeable to the work center supervisor.  UCRs will be documented even when it is not possible to determine who created the condition.  88 AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 Attachment 2 AF STANDARD AFE AUTOMATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (AIT) BARCODE MARKING A2.1.  Contractors and suppliers for all AFE systems to include subcomponents shall use bar code nameplates,  labels,  or  direct  part  markings  IAW  DoD  MIL-STD-130  Change  1,  DoD  Unique Identification (UID) Guide, and this document.  Use of an advanced part marking technology like bar codes and 2D symbols is essential to the AFE community being able to facilitate automated “removal  and  replace”  features  of  automated  programming  and  product  support/maintenance.  Exceptions to use of machine-readable nameplates will be considered, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with practical or good business sense (e.g., part too small for nameplate, part immersed in fuel tank, etc.).  AFE will consider other advanced part marking technology should they become commercially practicable, driven by DoD requirements, and or advantageous to the government in the future. A2.2.  Marking Requirements  . A2.2.1.  Human Readable Information (HRI) and Machine Readable Information (MRI) are required for current AIT systems to provide the necessary advances in efficiency.  Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and the DoD have mandated the use of Data Matrix ECC 200 as the standard format for UID MRI markings.  Overarching guidance for the construct and application of Data Matrix markings is contained in MIL-STD-130 and DoD  UID  Guide  located  at  www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/sitemap.html.    Specific  examples  are given here for manufactures and suppliers for implementation. A2.2.2.  AFE has three different situations that require or can require different markings and they are: A2.2.1.1.  a.  UID  Serialized  Lot  Batch;  Items  controlled  with  serial  numbers  and  lot numbers A2.2.1.2.  b. UID Serialized Data Stream; Items controlled with serial numbers only A2.2.1.3.  c.  Non  UID/Non  Serialized  Lot  Batch;  Items  that  do  not  meet  the  UID requirement and are not controlled with serial numbers. A2.2.1.4.  See figures A2.1.  – A2.6 for specific examples of the labels and data streams. A2.3.  HRI Marking Requirements  .  The following HRI data is required (as a minimum): A2.3.1.  - Manufacturer’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, 5 alpha/numeric characters A2.3.2.  - Item Lot Number A2.3.2.1.  Note  :  The Lot Number MUST be unique within the manufacturer’s CAGE (Lot Numbers cannot be repeated on other part numbers) A2.3.3.  - Item Serial Number A2.3.3.1.  Note  :    AFE  contracts  typically  require  5  digit  serial  numbers  (minimum), sequentially assigned, not to be repeated until serial number 99,999 has been reached A2.3.4.  - Item manufacturer’s Part Number AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 89 A2.3.4.1.  Note  :    The  weapon  system  Specification  Number  does  not  meet  this requirement A2.3.5.  - Contract Number (CNCT#), 13 alpha/numeric characters. A2.3.6.  - Date of Manufacture; Year and Day of manufacture in Julian Date format. A2.3.6.1.  Note  :    Markings  and/or  attachments  shall  not  refer  to  item  installation requirements/procedures or shelf/service lives. A2.4.  MRI Data Construct  . A2.4.1.  Data Matrix ECC200 markings shall be developed based on UID Data Construct #2 using Data  Identifiers (DIs) in accordance with MIL-STD-130 and the DoD UID Guide (see Figure A2.2).  To facilitate durability throughout the scanning life cycle, the largest symbol size, including quiet zone, shall be fitted within the available marking real estate.  The symbol’s internal module (cell) sizes shall be no smaller than 0.0075 inch (0.19 mm) and no larger than 0.025 inch (0.64 mm).  Marks shall contain only the following data elements: A2.4.1.1.  Note  :  The parentheses surrounding the Data Identifier are NOT encoded in the 2D symbol. A2.4.2.  - (17V) Manufacturer’s CAGE code, 5 alpha/numeric characters. A2.4.3.  -  (1T)  Item  production  Lot  Number,  IAW  HRI  requirement,  Maximum  20 alpha/numeric, including special characters (- or /). A2.4.3.1.  Note  :  The lot number MUST be unique within the manufacturer’s CAGE (Lot Numbers cannot be repeated on other part numbers) A2.4.4.  -  (S)  Item  Serial  Number,  IAW  HRI  requirement,  Maximum  20  alpha/numeric including special characters (- or /). A2.4.5.  -  (1P)  Manufacturer’s  Item  Part  Number,  Maximum  20  alpha/numeric  including special characters (- or /). A2.4.5.1.  Note  :    The  weapon  system  Specification  Number  does  not  meet  this requirement. A2.4.6.  - (8K) Contract Number (Cont No), Maximum 13 alpha/numeric characters. A2.4.6.1.  Note  : For this data element, the dashes are not transmitted in the data stream. A2.4.7.  - (4D) Date of Manufacture (DOM) in Julian Date format, five numeric characters: A2.5.  Example: 06151 = 31 May 2006 A2.5.1.  The first two positions are the last two digits of the year; the last three positions are the Julian Date (001 through 366) 90 AFI11-301V1  10 OCTOBER 2017 Figure A2.1.
