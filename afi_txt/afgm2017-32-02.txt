Glossary of References and Supporting Information   Attachment 1 Chapter 1 OVERVIEW  A1.1.1.  Overview and Scope. The CEEG provides an overarching framework for governing the Air Force CE Enterprise through strategy development, direction setting, decision-making, and overseeing of enterprise-wide Civil Engineer process. For the purpose of this document, the CE Enterprise is the collection of engineer staff organizations that are above wing-level. The purpose of this AFGM is to describe the CEEG structure, roles and responsibilities. A1.1.2.  General Guidance. The objectives of the CEEG are to: A1.1.2.1. Provide an overarching framework for governing, providing oversight, and strategically aligning activities of the Air Force CE Enterprise. A1.1.2.2. Validate alignment of the Air Force CE Enterprise strategic priorities with Department of Defense and Air Force strategic priorities and inform the Air Force Strategic Planning and Programming Process. A1.1.2.3. Establish initiatives, as needed, in support of Air Force CE Enterprise strategic priorities and continuous process improvement. A1.1.2.4. Provide guidance and make decisions, within its scope, in support of the Civil Engineer Flight Plan by setting direction, tracking strategy execution and performance toward a strategic vision, and overseeing CE Enterprise processes and capabilities. A1.1.2.5. Provide guidance and make decisions regarding policy and oversight, within its scope, in support of the CE Enterprise. Track execution and performance toward CE Enterprise strategic vision. Track compliance with CE Enterprise policy and guidance. A1.1.2.6. Interface with the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) and other Air Force governing bodies as necessary to conduct CEEG responsibilities. A1.1.3.  Structure. The CEEG is a hierarchical structure (as depicted in Figure A1.1) comprised of one governance body (the Civil Engineer Board (CEB)), one collaboration body (Senior Leader Shared Table (SLST)), and two hybrid governance/collaboration bodies (Integration Table (I-Table) and Subordinate Tables (Sub-Tables)). The CEEG provides a structure for formal decision making via the CEB. The CEEG provides a structure for cross-organizational collaboration on strategic initiatives via the SLST. The I-Table acts as an intermediary between Sub-Tables and either the SLST or CEB to ensure the right issues are presented to the right bodies at the right time. Together the I-Table and Sub-Tables balance governance and collaboration. The governance body, the CEB, is responsible for policy, oversight and guidance, while the collaboration body, the SLST, is responsible for strategy and transformational initiatives. See Chapter 3 for more information on the CEEG governance bodies.     Figure A1.1 CEEG Structure.  A1.1.4.  Relationship to other Governance Structures. A1.1.4.1. The CEEG is a functional governance structure aligned under the Installation Executive Council (IEC) governance body. The IEC provides a forum for decision making above the CEB. The CEB makes engineer-specific recommendations to the IEC on major Air Force installation interests and takes actions to meet the IEC’s strategic intent. A1.1.4.2. CEEG does not impinge upon authorities of Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center (AFIMSC) Commander (AFIMSC/CC) and Air Force Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC) Director (AFCEC/CL) to exercise their responsibilities in executing the Air Force mission within their command authority/Administrative Control. A1.1.4.3. CEEG will drive Air Force strategy and policy that may require AFIMSC and AFCEC to apportion and manage resources to achieve the desired results. A1.1.4.4. When appropriate, CEEG bodies may bring issues or topics forward to other governance bodies (e.g. AFCEC Corporate Board, Installation & Mission Support Board) for input or decision.   A1.1.5.  Coordination Processes. Good governance depends on effective collaboration and proper coordination. While formal coordination is separate from the governance structure described in this AFGM, proper staff work through formal coordination ensures organizations agree on the way CEB decisions are implemented.     Chapter 2  ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES A1.2.1.

CE Board. The purpose of the CEB is to make decisions on policy and guidance that are aligned to CE Enterprise strategy and incorporate the vision, priorities, and goals established by the IEC for real property, family and unaccompanied housing, military and family housing construction, expeditionary engineering, force presentation, fire/emergency services, explosive ordnance, emergency management, energy security, sustainability, and the environment. As part of its oversight responsibility, the CEB can schedule and conduct Program Management Reviews (PMR). Consistent with IEC direction, the CEB may give direction, establish metrics, or take other actions designed to ensure programs meet CE Enterprise strategy and IEC vision, priorities, and goals. The CEB takes action on issues and topics brought forth by the I-Table. The CEB PMR function does not preclude any authorized organization from scheduling and conducting PMRs separate from the CEB.  A1.3.1.1. The CEB is chaired by either SAF/IEE, SAF/IEI, or AF/A4C as appropriate according to the authorities related to the topic being considered by the board. In general, matters encompassed in HAF MD 1-18 will be chaired by either SAF/IEE or SAF/IEI; for all other matters, the CEB will be chaired by AF/A4C or Deputy Director of Civil Engineers (AF/A4C-2). For matters encompassed in HAF MD 1-18 when SAF/IEE or SAF/IEI are not available to chair the CEB, they can delegate CE Chair responsibilities to either AF/A4C or AF/A4C-2 to act as a proxy. A1.3.1.2. The CEB Chair acts as the decision-maker for all matters presented at the board that are encompassed within their authorities (e.g., SAF/IEE or SAF/IEI for HAF MD 1-18; AF/A4C for all other matters). This includes decisions to establish a Sub-Table when the I-Table and/or SLST is unable to come to consensus. If a Sub-Table is established, all assigned organizations are obligated to participate in Sub-Table as required. The CEB Chair will invite views of others and weigh input from CEB Members and Advisory Members in the decision-making process.  A1.3.1.3. Members of the CEB are as follows: SAF/IEE, SAF/IEI, AF/A4C, AFIMSC/CC and AFCEC/CL except when the member is the Chair of the CEB. Members may send designated representatives to weigh-in on CEB matters, except when the member is the CEB Chair. A1.3.1.4.  Advisory Members of the CEB are as follows: Agile Combat Support Core Function Lead Integrator Representative, Installation Support Panel Chair, MAJCOM A4s (delegable to the MAJCOM Senior Civil Engineers), and Air Reserve Component (ARC) representatives from National Guard Bureau (NGB) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). The CEB chair may request the participation of additional advisors not listed above to provide expertise, guidance, and to assist in identifying and assessing the impacts or risks of potential decisions. A1.3.1.5. AF/A4CI Governance Branch Chief will serve as the Executive Secretary for the CEB and will provide day-to-day support as needed. A1.3.1.6. Link to the Air Force Corporate Structure: The CEB makes engineer-specific recommendations to the IEC on major Air Force installation interests and takes actions to meet the IEC’s strategic intent. The CEB can also make recommendations to the AFCS through SAF/IE’s and AF/A4’s representative at the AF Group, Board, and Council. A1.3.2.  Senior Leader Shared Table. The SLST is a strategic forum for senior leaders to discuss priorities and goals, and to collaborate on opportunities and challenges facing the CE Enterprise in order to set CE Enterprise strategy and foster informed decision-making within each senior leader’s authorities. Members of the SLST collaboratively review recommendations and make decisions within their authorities related to strategy and transformation initiatives in order to move in a common strategic direction across the CE Enterprise. Members of the SLST engage on issues brought forth by the I-Table and incorporate outcomes to evolve CE’s strategic direction in support of Air Force objectives and aligned with the Air Force SP3. A1.3.2.1. The SLST is comprised of the following Core Members: SAF/IEE, SAF/IEI, AF/A4C, AFIMSC/CC (or AFIMSC/IZ, as designated), and AFCEC/CL. A1.3.2.2.  Additional attendees may be invited upon the recommendation of any of the Core Members. A1.3.2.3. AF/A4CI will serve as the Executive Secretary for the SLST and will provide day-to-day support as needed. A1.3.2.4. The SLST approves the I-Table charter. Integration Table. The purpose of the I-Table is to maintain a systems view (an A1.3.3. end-to-end look from strategy through execution) of the CE Enterprise to ensure the necessary collaboration is taking place on issues or opportunities across the enterprise. Its members address questions, provide guidance for Sub-Table operations, and determine topics that should be presented to the appropriate body, including the CEB, SLST, Sub-Tables, or other existing governance bodies. For topics elevating to the CEB or SLST, the I-Table ensures that all equity-holders were represented in the collaboration process to enable more informed decision-making for Senior Leaders. A1.3.3.1. The I-Table is comprised of Core Members from the following organizations –AF/A4C (Deputy Director), SAF/IEE (Principal Director), SAF/IEI (Principal Director), HQ AFIMSC (Representative, as designated), AFCEC (Representative, as designated), and an ARC Representative.  A1.3.3.1.1.  Authorized representatives may stand in for the Core Members on the condition that they can speak on behalf of their organizations. A1.3.3.1.2.  Additional attendees may be invited upon the recommendation of any of the Core Members. A1.3.3.2. AF/A4CI, while not a Core Member, will serve as the Administrative Lead for the I-Table and will facilitate meetings and provide day-to-day support. A1.3.3.3. The I-Table develops its own charter – including scope, success standards, schedule, initial battle rhythm, and non-Core Members – to outline focused and purposeful business operations. The SLST shall approve the I-Table charter. A1.3.3.4. The I-Table approves the charters for each Sub-Table to include Sub-Table scope, success standards, schedule, member organizations, initial battle rhythm.   A1.3.3.5. The I-Table approves the stand-up / stand-down of Sub-Tables, working groups, panels, etc. A1.3.4.  Subordinate Tables. Sub-Tables are cross-organizational forums or teams with unity of effort to execute assigned missions/tasks and to foster collaboration across the CE Enterprise. Each Sub-Table collaborates on and de-conflicts CE Enterprise opportunities for a designated purpose (e.g., initiatives, functions) identified within their charter and engages key stakeholders to promote innovation, information sharing, and collaborative advancement of enterprise-level efforts.  A1.3.4.1. The Sub-Table Administrative Lead (Admin Lead) is approved by the I-Table; the Sub-Table Admin Lead will generally be an O-6 or GS-15 from SAF/IEE, SAF/IEI, AF/A4C, HQ AFIMSC, or AFCEC. Sub-Table Admin Leads may rotate to a different person or different organization as determined by the I-Table to best achieve the desired effect. A1.3.4.1.1.  Sub-Table Admin Leads provide integrated management and administration support for review of efforts across the CE Enterprise within a designated portfolio or functional area. A1.3.4.1.2.  Sub-Table Admin Leads do not act as the decision-maker - this responsibility rests on all members of the Sub-Table within their own authorities or via escalation to the I-Table. A1.3.4.2. Sub-Tables are comprised of Core Members that represent the Total Force from organizations across the CE Enterprise that include (but are not limited to): SAF/IEE, SAF/IEI, AF/A4C, HQ AFIMSC, AFCEC, and appropriate MAJCOMs. A1.3.4.2.1.
