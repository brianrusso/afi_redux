Purpose  and  Objectives.  The  Air  Force  participates  in  air,  space,  and  cyberspace International Armaments Cooperation programs to build partnerships and partnership capacity of a  mutually  beneficial  nature.    IAC  establishes  new  relationships  and  sustains  and  expands existing relationships to promote interoperability, integration, and interdependence.  The USAF participates  in  IAC  to  build  partnerships  and  secure  access  to  the  best  technologies  available, among  other  objectives,  as  elaborated  in  Chapter  2  of  the  AFI  16-110.    The  specific  tools available to USAF proponents in pursuit of IAC activities are referenced below and explained in greater detail through subsequent chapters of this AFMAN. 1.2.  IAC  Background.  IAC  refers  to  cooperative  research,  development,  test  and  evaluation (RDT&E)  of  defense  technologies,  systems  or  equipment;  joint  production  and  follow-on support  of  defense  articles  or  equipment;  and  procurement  of  foreign  technology,  equipment, systems  or  logistics  support.    AFI  16-110  provides  IAC  program  descriptions,  purpose  and objectives,  DoD  and  USAF  policies  and  guidelines,  and  responsibilities  assigned  to  specific USAF  organizations.    Required  and  related  publications,  abbreviations,  acronyms,  and definitions used in this volume are listed in Attachment 1. 1.2.1.  The IAC procedures and responsibilities described in this AFMAN apply to air, space, and  cyberspace  technology  and  systems.    Though  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air Force,  International  Affairs,  Armaments  Cooperation  Division  (SAF/IAPQ)  is  listed  as having responsibility for IAC throughout this manual, the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force,  International  Affairs,  Space  and  Cyberspace  Division  (SAF/IAPS)  carries  out responsibilities for IAC programs, projects, and forums involving space and cyberspace. 1.3.  IAC  Categories.  The  following  provides  a  brief  description  of  the  various  types  of  IAC programs available for use in accomplishing IAC objectives: 1.3.1.  International  Cooperation  (IC)  in  Acquisition,  Technology,  and  Logistics (AT&L)  Program.  IC  in  AT&L  pertains  to  any  international  agreement  (IA)  concluded with one or more foreign governments or with an international organization.  These activities range from small science and technology (S&T) efforts to multi-million dollar, multinational projects  or  programs.    Regardless  of  size,  these  activities  are  characterized  by  the  fact  that they  are  based  on  mutual  and  equitable  sharing  of  effort,  cost,  and  risk,  either  in  RDT&E, cooperative  production,  and/or  logistics  of  a  defense  article;  and  share  the  resulting information,  equipment,  or  other  benefits  equitably.    The  parties  commit  to  these arrangements  through  the  development  of  Memoranda  of  Understandings  (MOUs)  or Memoranda  of  Agreement  (MOAs),  Project  Agreements  or  Arrangements  (PAs),  and Equipment  and  Material  Transfer  Arrangements  (E&MTAs).    The  general  procedures  and requirements for the majority of IAC agreements are described in Chapter 2.  Later chapters and their accompanying attachments detail unique requirements for particular IAC programs. 1.3.2.  Information  Exchange  Program.  Information  Exchange  Annexes/Data  Exchange Annexes  (IEAs/DEAs)  are  developed  for  the  exchange  of  RDT&E  information  on  a reciprocal, balanced basis.  These annexes deal with specific technologies in a generic, non-  6  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 system  specific  manner  and  involve  the  exchange  of  reports,  technical  documents,  and related information (Chapter 3). 1.3.3.  International Testing Programs. 1.3.3.1.  The  Test  and  Evaluation  (T&E)  Program  is  DoD-managed  and  enables  the USAF  and  a  partner  nation  or  international  governmental  organization  access  to  each other’s  test  facilities.    It  also  allows  for  cooperative  T&E-related  projects  and  is implemented through a series of MOAs that the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has concluded with selected partners having T&E capability (Chapter 4). 1.3.3.2.  The  Foreign  Comparative  Testing  (FCT)  Program  tests  and  evaluates  foreign Non-Developmental Items (NDI) of military equipment that demonstrates the potential to satisfy U.S. military requirements (Chapter 5). 1.3.4.  Personnel Exchange Programs. 1.3.4.1.  The Engineer and Scientist Exchange Program (ESEP) enables the exchange of military or civilian engineers and scientists in RDT&E positions (Chapter 6). 1.3.4.2.  The  Administrative  and  Professional  Exchange  Program  (APEP)  enables  the exchange  of  military  or  civilian  specialist  personnel  in  administrative,  finance,  health, legal, logistics, planning, and other support functions (Chapter 6). 1.3.5.  International  Cooperative  Research  and  Development  (ICR&D)  Program.  The USAF-managed  ICR&D Program seeks to enhance conventional defense capabilities of the U.S.  and  its  allies  through  “seed  money”  support  to  cooperative  projects  until  program funding is available through the normal budget process (Chapter 7). 1.3.6.  Coalition  Warfare  Program  (CWP).  The  CWP,  managed  by  the  Office  of  the Under  Secretary  of  Defense (Acquisition,  Technology,  &  Logistics)/International Cooperation OUSD(AT&L)/IC, promotes interoperability in support of coalition warfare by early  identification  of  operational  issues  that  can  be  overcome  with  innovative  solutions  in areas such as architectures, requirements, and systems acquisitions (Chapter 8). 1.3.7.  International Other Transactions (OTs) and Non-domestic Cooperative Research and  Development  Agreements  (CRADAs).  OTs  and  CRADAs  enable  the  USAF  to  enter into cooperative agreements with foreign non-government entities (Chapter 9). 1.3.8.  NATO  and  Other  IAC  Forums.  The  USAF  participates  in  many  international forums and activities that promote IAC.  A number of organizations lead them, to include the North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO),  OUSD(AT&L)/IC,  Headquarters  U.S.  Air Force  (HQ  USAF),  and  Major  Commands  (MAJCOMs).    These  forums  and  activities normally  review  existing  programs,  provide  executive-level  oversight,  and  highlight opportunities that may result in future IAC projects.  USAF participation in these forums is described in Chapter 10. 1.3.9.  Armaments  Cooperation  Policy.  The  implementing  laws,  policies,  and  directives governing the majority of IAC activities are described in detail in Chapter 11. AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   7  Chapter 2 DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING INTERNATIONAL ARMAMENTS COOPERATION (IAC) AGREEMENTS 2.1.  Purpose  and  Objectives.  This  chapter  contains  guidelines  and  procedures  for  initiating, developing,  coordinating,  and  implementing  the  following  basic  IAC  agreements:    Memoranda of  Agreement  or  Understanding  (MOAs  or  MOUs),  Project  Agreements/Arrangements  (PAs) under “umbrella” MOAs/MOUs, and Loan Agreements (LAs).  MOAs/MOUs, PAs, and LAs are sometimes referred to generically as international agreements. 2.2.  International  Agreements  (IA)  Background.  The  U.S.  considers  IAs  to  be  legally binding  documents;  however,  some  potential  partner  nations  have  different  views  on  how  they can be bound under IAs.  Whenever possible, the IAC document should be described in terms of an “Agreement”, such as a “Memorandum of Agreement.”  MOAs may pertain to the full range of acquisition activity, from basic research to production and cooperative logistics.  In a bilateral IA, the U.S.  and the partner nation can negotiate the appropriate  wording to  meet  the needs of both  nations  with  respect  to  binding  obligations.    Details  on  the  common  legal  authorities governing the majority of IAs can be found in Chapter 11 of this AFMAN. 2.2.1.  Memorandums  of  Agreement/Memorandums  of  Understanding  (MOAs/MOUs) (hereafter referred to as MOAs).  Proponents for an IAC effort may draft an MOA to focus on  a  specific  program  of  work  referred  to  as  a  “project”  MOA  or  an  “umbrella”  MOA composed of several phases or projects.  The type of MOA chosen depends upon the nature of the cooperative effort.  Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) MOAs are one  of  the  most  common.    SAF/IAPQ  must  Request  Authority  to  Develop  (RAD)  IAC MOAs from OUSD(AT&L)/IC before beginning negotiation of an  IA; however, PAs under an  existing  umbrella  MOA  need  only  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force, International Affairs (SAF/IA) authority.   PAs  are implementing 2.2.2.  Project  Agreements/Project  Arrangements  (PAs). arrangements,  not  stand-alone  agreements;  they  are  always  associated  with  an  umbrella MOA.  PAs detail the provisions of collaboration on specific projects between two or more parties.    The  details  include  the  project  objectives,  scope  of  work,  management  structure, financial arrangements,  contractual arrangements, security  classification,  and any additional specific  provisions.    PAs  are  expeditious  means  for  the  USAF  to  initiate  cooperative activities  in  basic  research,  exploratory  development,  or  advanced  development  (budget categories  6.1  through  6.3  and,  in  some  instances,  6.4).    Engineering  and  Manufacturing Development (EMD) or production programs that evolve from cooperative efforts under one or  more  PAs  generally  require  separate  agreements,  usually  another  MOA,  because  such work  is  usually  outside  the  scope  of  the  original  umbrella  MOA.    To  reduce  the  time necessary to bring these cooperative projects from concept to conclusion, OUSD(AT&L)/IC has delegated SAF/IA the authority to develop  and negotiate PAs.  However, SAF/IA must obtain  OUSD(AT&L)/IC  approval  through  a  Request  for  Final  Approval  (RFA)  process before signing the agreement. 2.2.2.1.  Cooperative Project Personnel (CPP).  The CPP concept, authorized in Title 10 U.S.C. § 168, allows for the placement of U.S. and foreign military or civilian specialist   8  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 personnel  in  a  cooperative  program  or  project  office  to  support  specific  project responsibilities  under  an  IA.    There  is  usually  a  specific  annex  in  the  IA  that  addresses placement and use of CPP.  CPP can serve in  the areas of management, administration, finance, planning, RDT&E, logistics and can be assigned in any location appropriate for a project, either in the U.S. or abroad.  The project office is normally required to prepare a position  description  for  each  CPP  assignment  that  is  approved  by  the  management structure in the IA.  CPPs may not be assigned to command or other positions that would require  them  to  exercise  responsibilities  that  are  reserved  by  law  or  regulation  to  an officer or employee of the host organization.  Also, CPP generally cannot serve in a dual capacity, that is,  as an official  or  employee of the project  office and  as a representative for the parent organization.  For CPP to be fully effective, they should only be assigned access  to  project  office  facilities  to  include  information  technology  (IT)  equipment, project  documentation,  etc.,  required  for  the  performance  of  their  duties  and  in accordance with the laws and regulations of the government of the host organization. 2.2.3.  Loan  Agreements  (LAs).  LAs  provide  a  means  for  the  USAF  to  loan  or  borrow defense equipment or material for RDT&E purposes.  Under the provisions of Section 65 of the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22 U.S.C. § 2796d), the USAF may  enter into bilateral loan agreements with a country that is a NATO member nation or major non-NATO ally, as designated  under  Section  517  of  the  Foreign  Assistance  Act  (Title  22  U.S.C.  §  2321k),  to loan,  or  accept  as  a  loan  or  gift,  material,  equipment,  and  supplies  without  charge  for cooperative  RDT&E  purposes.    The  USAF  cannot  expend  any  funds  in  support  of  such  a loan.  The sharing of test results or exchange of technical information generated from the use of  the  loaned  equipment  represents  equitability  for  these  no-cost  loans.    The  loan  of equipment may be part of an MOA or PA and take the form of an Equipment and Material Transfer Arrangement (E&MTA).  SAF/IAPQ must provide a copy of the negotiated LA and supporting documentation to  the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) for final  review before entering into the agreement. 2.2.3.1.  When  a  project  is  not  an  RDT&E  project,  or  when  the  cooperative  partner  is other than a NATO member nation or major non-NATO ally, Section 65 authority is not available.  In those circumstances, equipment may be provided under the lease authority contained in AECA Section 61 (Title 22 U.S.C. § 2796). 2.3.  International  Agreement  Documentation  Requirements.  Following  exploratory discussions  (see  paragraph  2.4.1.1.),  the  IA  proponent,  with  the  assistance  of  an  International Cooperative  Agreement  Team  (ICAT)  as  needed  (see  paragraphs  under  section  2.4.2.),  will prepare the following draft documentation required for SAF/IAPQ to obtain authority to develop and negotiate an  IA and other documentation as required.  An approval  memo from  an official (O-6  or  above)  in  the  proponent’s  organization  who  has  the  authority  to  commit  funds  and resources to the IA must be included in the package submitted to SAF/IAPQ. 2.3.1.  Summary  Statement  of  Intent  (SSOI).  The  SSOI  is  a  U.S.  Government-only document  that  describes  the  scope  and  content  of  the  proposed  IA.    The  SSOI  is  used  to Request Authority to Develop (RAD) and Request for Final Approval (RFA) to conclude an international  agreement.    The  SSOI  facilitates  the  drafting  of  the  IA  and  other  appropriate documentation, and is also used during the RFA process.  The format for the SSOI and the instructions for completing it are shown in Attachment 2.  An abbreviated SSOI containing only  pertinent,  revised  information  will  be  submitted  for  proposed  amendments  to  existing AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   9  MOAs,  PAs,  and  LAs.    The  original  approved  SSOI  must  be  provided  with  abbreviated SSOIs. 2.3.2.  International  Agreement.  The  draft  text  of  an  MOA  or  LA  must  use  the  standard language  found  in  the  IA  Generator  (IA  GEN).    The  IA  GEN  is  designed  to  assist  the  IA proponent  in  quickly  developing  draft  agreements  that  conform  to  relevant  U.S.  law.  Proponents  should  consult  with  SAF/IAPQ  regarding  the  use  and  application  of  the  latest approved  version  of  the  IA  GEN.    Note:    For  PAs,  the  DoD  and  foreign  Ministry(ies)  of Defence  (MOD)  agreed  to  a  standard  PA  format  during  umbrella  MOA  negotiations.    The PA template is attached as an annex to the umbrella MOA. 2.3.3.  Delegation  of  Disclosure  Authority  Letter  (DDL).  The  DDL  provides  guidance regarding releasability of all elements of the system, information, or technology involved in an  IA.    A  DDL  is  required  if  the  project  involves  release  of  Controlled  Unclassified Information  (CUI) or classified information.   The format for the DDL is  shown in  AFI 16-201,  Air  Force  Foreign  Disclosure  and  Technology  Transfer  Program,  and  in  Attachment 2.2.  of  this  AFMAN.    The  DDL  will  also  provide  guidance  to  support  evaluation  of  any proposed  exports  or  releases  of  defense  articles  or  technical  documents  by  other  DoD Components and defense contractors.  DDLs will be classified if the information contained therein is classified, based on derivative classification guidance or the compilation principle.  Marking  a  DDL  classified  based  upon  compilation  requires  endorsement  by  an  original classification  authority.    The  highest  security  classification  level  of  information  to  be exchanged in a specific IA must be consistent with the corresponding DDL.  Along with the SSOI, the DDL supports the USAF position prior to entering into formal negotiations with a foreign government.  Regardless of security classification, DDLs will not be disclosed to any foreign  government,  representative  thereof,  foreign  national,  or  international  governmental organization.    USAF  Foreign  Disclosure  Offices  (FDOs)  must  authorize  disclosure  of classified  information  and  CUI.    In  developing  a  DDL,  the  IA  proponent  will  consult  with their  local  or  servicing  FDO  who  develops  the  draft  DDL  in  accordance  with  AFI  16-201.  After  MAJCOM  FDO  approval,  the  draft  DDL  will  be  forwarded  to  SAF/IAPQ  by  the MAJCOM FDO for inclusion in the IA staffing package.  Proponents are not responsible for including the draft DDL in their IA submission package to IAPQ but are required to include the date the DDL was initially submitted to the MAJCOM FDO in the approval memo.  The approved DDL provides continuous disclosure authority over the life of the IA and may be updated as required. 2.4.  IA  Process.  DoDD  5530.3  and  AFI  51-701,  Negotiating,  Concluding,  Reporting,  and Maintaining International Agreements, provide overall procedures and authorities for processing IAs.    DoDI  5000.02  allows  streamlined  procedures  for  all  OUSD(AT&L)-related  IAs.    The stages  of  development  are  Initiation,  Development  and  Negotiations,  and  Final  Review  and Approval.  The procedures described in this Chapter follow the streamlining concept for review and approval of IAs rather than the procedures described in DoDD 5530.3.  More information on the procedures can be found in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG), Chapter 11.2, and in the  IC  in  AT&L  Handbook,  released  by  the  Director,  OUSD(AT&L)/IC.    In  addition,  DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, (DoD FMR), Volume 12, Chapter 9, International Agreements,  contains  detailed  information  regarding  funding  and  equitability  with  which  DoD Components must comply when processing IAs and associated amendments.   10  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 2.4.1.  Initiation of IAs.  The objective of the initiation stage is to define the project, develop appropriate  staffing  documentation,  and  verify  proponent  support.    The  use  of  the International  Cooperative Agreement Team  (ICAT) concept  is  described in  paragraph 2.4.2 and is critical to achieving this objective. 2.4.1.1.  Preliminary or Exploratory Discussions.  Preliminary or exploratory discussions are  conducted  to  determine  whether  a  potential  project  is  the  most  cost-effective alternative  to  meet  a  USAF  requirement.    There  is  a  clear  distinction  between “exploratory  or  technical  discussions”  and  “negotiations.”    Proponents  may  engage  in preliminary or exploratory discussions with foreign counterparts to define and assess the viability  and  benefits  of  a  potential  cooperative  project.    USAF  personnel  must  make clear to their foreign counterparts that they cannot make or accept binding commitments in  such  exploratory  discussions  and  that  the  exploratory  discussions  do  not  constitute negotiations.    Furthermore,  DoD  personnel  are  prohibited  from  offering  to  or  accepting from representatives of a foreign government any draft agreement, whether titled as such or not.  The proponent should consult with SAF/IAPQ concerning the difference between exploratory  discussions  and  negotiations.    See  Attachment  A2.1  for  a  recommended template when conducting preliminary or exploratory discussions with a foreign partner.  Preliminary  or  exploratory  discussions  make  take  the  form  of  an  International Cooperative Agreement Team. 2.4.2.  International  Cooperative  Agreement  Team  (ICAT).  An  ICAT  is  an  integrated product team (IPT) formed to support the proponent in defining an international project and in  drafting  and  staffing  the  documentation  needed  for  an  IAC  agreement.    The  goal  of  an ICAT  is  to  determine  whether  the  proposed  international  project  is  feasible,  to  define  the potential scope of the project,  to  determine appropriate management structures and funding sources,  and  to  gain  proponent  management  support  for  the  IAC  project.    ICATs  are  the preferred  means  for  developing  and  staffing  IAC  agreements.    Through  an  ICAT,  all stakeholders  in  an  IAC  project  are  given  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  developing, planning,  and  staffing  of  an  IA  early  in  the  process,  thereby  improving  the  quality  of  the agreement  and  required  documentation,  as  well  as  reducing  the  overall  agreement development and staffing time. 2.4.2.1.  ICAT  Formation.    An  ICAT  can  be  formed  at  any  command  level  and  will normally  have  the  proponent  serve  as  the  lead.    Core  membership  typically  includes representatives from the disclosure, financial, international affairs (to include SAF/IAPQ as needed), legal, and programmatic communities.  Other members may be added on an as-needed basis. At times, the ICAT may include membership from another MILDEP or from  industry.   In-country  personnel  (e.g., Offices of Defense Cooperation (ODCs), the European Office of Aerospace Research and Development (EOARD), the Asian Office of Aerospace  Research  and  Development  (AOARD),  the  Southern  Office  of  Aerospace Research  and  Development  (SOARD),  etc.)  will  be  members  of  the  ICAT  when beneficial to achieving the project objectives. 2.4.2.2.  ICAT  Responsibilities. lead  drafts  appropriate  staffing documentation,  which  is  provided  to  SAF/IAPQ  under  official  signature  (defined  as  a memorandum  to  SAF/IAPQ  from  an  official  (O-6  or  above)  in  the  proponent’s organization  who  has  the  authority  to  commit  funds  and  resources  to  the  international agreement).    The  ICAT  lead  will  also  be  responsible  for  ensuring  dissemination  of  all   The ICAT AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   11  program  information  to  the  ICAT  membership.    The  lead  will  develop,  maintain,  and distribute an e-mail roster of ICAT membership to facilitate communications. 2.4.2.3.  Meetings.    Face-to-face  meetings  will  be  held  when  necessary;  but  other communication  venues  such  as  teleconferencing,  video  conferencing,  e-mail,  and  so  on will  be  used  to  the  extent  practical.    Early  identification  of  issues  and  cooperation between  all  affected  parties  will  enhance  the  agreement  development  and  staffing process. 2.4.2.4.  Action  Items.    The  ICAT  lead  is  responsible  for  documenting,  tracking,  and disseminating action items. 2.4.3.   Procedures for Staffing IAs.  The USAF must submit a memorandum to OUSD(AT&L)/IC to Request Authority to Develop a MOA.  OUSD(AT&L)/IC has delegated the MILDEPs authority to develop LAs and PAs under umbrella MOAs so this requirement does not apply to LAs and PAs.  In these cases, SAF/IAPQ staffs the LA or PA within the AF for RAD coordination before beginning negotiations.  The typical process for developing, staffing, and negotiating IAs is shown in Figure 2.1 on page 16. 2.4.3.1.  Staffing  MOAs  for  RAD.    Typically,  to  initiate  the  RAD  process  for  MOAs, SAF/IAPQ staffs the draft SSOI, the draft MOA, and the draft DDL with appropriate HQ USAF offices to include the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Financial Management and  Comptroller,  Budget  Management  and  Execution  Directorate  (SAF/FMBM),  Air Force  General  Counsel,  International  Affairs  (SAF/GCI),  the  relevant  Deputy  Under Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  International  Affairs  (SAF/IA)  Divisions,  including  the Foreign  Disclosure  and  Technology  Transfer  (SAF/IAPD)  and  Weapons  (SAF/IARW) Divisions, the appropriate Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ) Directorate(s),  and  other  offices,  as  appropriate.    If  there  are  HQ  USAF  comments  or concerns, SAF/IAPQ adjudicates them, then re-staffs as necessary.  Upon HQ USAF approval of the draft documents, SAF/IAPQ forwards the SSOI (as well as the MOA text when OSD makes that request) to OUSD(AT&L)/IC with a formal RAD memorandum.    OUSD(AT&L)/IC  staffs  the  RAD  to  a  number  of  offices,  including appropriate OSD offices, MILDEPs, and other offices as appropriate, under a 21-working day  silence  procedure.    If  no  objection  is  made  within  21  working  days,  approval  is assumed.  Note: Several offices, including the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  (OUSD(C))  and  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  General  Counsel (OSD/GC),  are  exempt  from  the  21-working  day  silence  procedure.    When  OSD approves  the  request,  OUSD(AT&L)/IC  formally  delegates  authority  to  develop  and negotiate the MOA by memorandum to SAF/IA.  Negotiations begin as soon as possible after the granting of RAD. 2.4.3.2.  Staffing PAs and LAs for RAD.  SAF/IAPQ staffs the draft SSOI, the draft PA or  LA,  and  the  draft  DDL  with  appropriate  HQ  USAF  offices  to  include  SAF/FMBM, SAF/GCI,  SAF/IAPD,  SAF/IARW,  the  appropriate  SAF/AQ  Directorate(s),  SAF/IA regional  division(s),  and  other  offices,  as  appropriate.    When  the  HQ  USAF  staff  has comments,  changes,  or  otherwise  does  not  approve  the  documents,  SAF/IAPQ adjudicates  them,  then  re-staffs  as  necessary.    Upon  completion  of  HQ  USAF  staffing, SAF/IAPQ  initiates  negotiations,  as  OUSD(AT&L)/IC  has  delegated  the  authority  to develop PAs and LAs to the USAF.   12  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 2.4.4.  Development  and  Negotiation.  DoDD 5530.3 specifically prohibits DoD personnel from  initiating  or  conducting  negotiations  of  an  international  agreement  without  the  prior written approval of USD(AT&L).  SAF/IAPQ is the HQ USAF organization responsible for negotiating  IAC  agreements  and  will  only  conduct  negotiations  after  it  has  obtained appropriate  approval  from  HQ  USAF  offices  and/or  OUSD(AT&L)/IC.    After  RAD  is granted,  SAF/IAPQ  will  transmit  the  draft  IA  to  the  prospective  partners  for  negotiation.  This is usually done by  means of a memorandum via email  from SAF/IAPQ to appropriate offices in the partner nation(s).  This correspondence should include the draft IA text as well as a suggested approach and schedule for conducting the negotiations.  The objective of the negotiation phase is for the USAF to reach agreement with the partner(s) on all of the terms of the international project and text of the IA. 2.4.4.1.  Negotiating  Team.    SAF/IAPQ  approves  the  membership  of  the  negotiation team,  which  usually  consists  of  a  principal  negotiator  from  SAF/IAPQ,  a  SAF/GCI representative, and subject matter experts, as appropriate.  The principal negotiator is the spokesperson for, and manager of, the team.  The parties will negotiate IAs in the most efficient  manner  possible,  ranging  from  face-to-face  meetings,  through  teleconferences and videoconferences, to e-mail, fax, telephone, or regular mail. 2.4.4.2.  Delegation  Guidance.    Each  IA  negotiation  is  unique  and  is  affected  by  the nature of the project, the number and identity of foreign partners, and other domestic and international  considerations.    Depending  on  the  complexity  of  a  specific  negotiation, SAF/IAPQ  will  develop  written  guidance  for  all  delegation  members  prior  to  the  first negotiation  session.    This  helps  ensure  team  consistency  and  can  lead  to  achieving  an agreed IA text more quickly.  The guidance could address items such as red-line topics, individual  team  member  tasks,  speaking  assignments,  and  administrative  protocols  and procedures. 2.4.4.3.  Non-binding  nature  of  negotiations.    During  the  negotiation  process,  the  U.S. negotiators  will  make  it  clear  to  potential  partners  that  they  cannot  make  binding commitments  until  the  negotiated  agreement  is  approved  by  appropriate  higher authorities. 2.4.5.  Final  Review  and  Approval.  The objectives of the final  review and approval  stage are to obtain approval from OUSD(AT&L)/IC to conclude the IA following negotiations so as to enable signature of it by all involved parties. 2.4.5.1.  SAF/IAPQ will submit a RFA package to OUSD(AT&L)/IC.  The package will contain, at a minimum, a memorandum requesting final review and approval, the IA, and SSOI.  Note: RFA packages with IAs using Section 27 of the AECA or Title 10 U.S.C. § 2350a with Friendly Foreign Countries (FFCs) as their legal authority must also include a draft certification to Congress. 2.4.5.2.  OUSD(AT&L)/IC will staff the RFA package with all appropriate OSD offices, the  MILDEPs,  and  other  appropriate  government  agencies  for  coordination.    Over  the course of this step, SAF/IAPQ may be required to provide OUSD(AT&L)/IC additional information, coordinate proposed changes within the USAF, or renegotiate recommended changes to the IA with the foreign partner.  If no issues are identified, OUSD(AT&L)/IC will sign a memorandum delegating authority to the Air Force to sign the IA.  Normally, AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   13  this  delegation  is  to  SAF/IA,  however,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  IA,  it  may  be delegated and signed at a higher level. 2.4.5.3.  Upon  receipt  of  the  memorandum  from  OUSD(AT&L)/IC  approving  the  RFA, SAF/IAPQ  will  prepare  the  appropriate  number  of  original  IA  documents  for  USAF signature  and  for  the  signatures  of  all  involved  parties.    The  number  of  originals  is normally determined based on each party receiving an original signed version of the IA.  SAF/IA,  the  Assistant  SAF/IA,  and  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force, International Affairs, Director of Policy (SAF/IAP) are authorized signatories for USAF IAC  agreements.    Oftentimes,  the  IA  enters  into  force  on  the  date  of  last  signature, however, some IAs spell out unique entry into force circumstances within their text. 2.5.  Pre-Signature Requirements for IAs. 2.5.1.  Agreements  in  a  Foreign  Language.  In  accordance  with  DoDD  5530.3,  paragraph 8.11, no IA may be concluded in a foreign language unless the agreement expressly provides that: (1) the English language text will be considered by the parties as the governing text in case of conflict between the different language texts; or (2) the agreement expressly provides that  the  English  language  text  and  the  foreign  language  text  are  equally  authentic.    A linguistic  certification  that  these  criteria  have  been  met  must  accompany  the  text  of  the agreement.  A Certificate of Language Conformity will be issued after a thorough review of both the English and foreign language versions of the IA to ensure that both versions are in conformity  with  each  other  and  have  the  same  meaning  in  all  substantive  respects.    The language certification format is provided in Attachment 2.5. 2.5.2.  Certification  to  Congress is required for IAs falling under Section 27 of the AECA or for IAs involving FFCs under Title 10 U.S.C. § 2350a.  Not less than thirty days before the signing  of  the  IA,  DoD  is  required  to  submit  a  certification  or  report  on  the  proposed cooperative IA to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the Chairs of the Senate Committees  on  Foreign  Relations  and  Armed  Services.    SAF/IAPQ  prepares  a  draft  of  the certification  for  transmission  to  OUSD(AT&L)/IC.    The  certification  format  is  provided  at Attachment 2.6.   14  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 Figure 2.1.  Typical process for developing, staffing, and negotiating IAs  2.6.  Post-Signature Requirements for IAs. 2.6.1.  Transmittal Memorandum.  The Case-Zablocki Act (Title 1 U.S.C. § 112b) requires the Secretary of State to report all IAs, other than treaties, to Congress within sixty calendar days  after  entry  into  force.    Accordingly,  SAF/IAPQ  uses  a  transmittal  memorandum  to forward copies of each signed MOA, PA, or  LA  to  the Air Force Judge Advocate General, Operations and International Law Directorate (AF/JAO), OSD/GC, and to the Department of State  (DoS)  Assistant  Legal  Adviser  for  Treaty  Affairs,  within  twenty  days  after  entry  into force.  The number of certified copies required by each office above is specified in AFI 51-701.    The  transmittal  memorandum  must  include  a  background  statement  meeting  the requirements  of  DoDD  5530.3  Enclosures  3  and  6,  and  AFI  51-701.    In  the  case  of  an  IA AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   15  concluded  in  a  foreign  language,  the  Certificate  of  Language  Conformity  should  also  be attached.  Each copy of the IA should include a Certificate of Authenticity (Attachment 2.7.) that  attests  to  each  copy  being  a  true  copy  of  the  original  IA.    If  the  text  of  the  IA  is transmitted  more  than  twenty  days  after  its  entry  into  force,  the  transmittal  memorandum must state the reason for late submission.  SAF/IAPQ  will  use  the  above  transmittal  memorandum  for  disseminating  the  signed  IA  to the appropriate DoD, HQ USAF, and  field-level points of contact.    In conjunction  with  the transmittal  memorandum,  SAF/IAPQ  will  provide  SAF/IAPD  a  copy  of  the  signed agreement  and  the  coordinated  DDL.    SAF/IAPD  will  approve  the  DDL  and  delegate disclosure authority for the IA as appropriate. 2.6.2.  Steering  Committee  (SC)  Appointment  Letter.  SAF/IAPQ  will  issue  a  SC appointment letter that defines the U.S. representative’s role, responsibility, and authority for all IAs that have a SC. 2.6.3.  Negotiating  History  File.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  DoDD  5530.3, SAF/IAPQ  will  maintain  a  complete  negotiating  history  file  that  is  compiled,  retained,  and maintained in retrievable form for all USAF IAC IAs. 2.6.4.  Reporting  Requirements.  All  IAs  require  submission  of  a  final  report  (format  in Attachment  2.8.)  from  their  U.S.  proponents  to  SAF/IAPQ.    In  addition,  some  IAs  contain provisions  specifying  certain  reporting  requirements.    U.S.  project  officers  and  MOA  SC representatives must comply with both reporting obligations, as well as others necessary for the execution of IAs not cited herein.  This includes IAs that use Coalition Warfare Program (CWP)  funds  (see  Chapter  8)  or  management  reports  applicable  at  the  field  level, MAJCOMs, or HQ USAF. 2.7.  Implementing, Amending, Withdrawing From, and Terminating IAs. 2.7.1.  Implementation.    After  signature,  some  IAs  require  other  documents  for  execution.  For  IAs  that  require  the  transfer  of  funds  between  the  partners,  a  Financial  Management Procedures Document  (FMPD) is  required.   The  FMPD contains the procedures to be used by  the  parties  in  execution  of  the  financial  aspects  of  the  IA,  for  example,  the  details  for using the banking system, payment schedules, etc.  A Program Security Instruction (PSI) is usually required when the transfer of classified information is involved.  The PSI contains all of  the  security  arrangements  and  procedures  that  form  the  security  standard  operating procedures  for  the  program.    Both  documents  should  be  drafted  as  a  team  effort  with  the other parties to the IA early in the development process.  Others examples of implementing documents  called  for  in  some  IAs  are  a  project  plan  and  position  descriptions  for  CPP.  Proponents are responsible for developing all implementing documents and SAF/IAPQ will coordinate them with the appropriate HQ USAF and/or OSD offices. 2.7.2.  Amendments.  Amendments to an IA must be approved via the same procedures used to develop the original IA.  They include those provisions which by themselves might form the  basis  of  a  separate  agreement,  such  as  a  new  phase  or  task,  or  that  propose  a  new  or altered  obligation  not  previously  contemplated  by  the  parties  or  contained  in  the  IA,  e.g., changes in scope, task, contributions, classification, or duration of the IA.  The required IA supporting documents for an amendment are the same as for the original IA, except that the proponent will submit an abbreviated SSOI containing only pertinent, revised information for   16  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 the  proposed  amendment  to  accompany  the  SSOI  for  the  original  agreement.    Proponents should  notify  SAF/IAPQ  of  proposed  amendments  as  soon  as  possible  to  ensure  that  the appropriate documents are prepared. 2.7.3.  Withdrawal and Termination.  If the USAF is considering unilateral withdrawal from an  existing  IA,  the  proponent  will  consult  with  SAF/IAPQ  at  least  ninety  days  before  the anticipated announcement date.  If the decision to withdraw is mutually agreed, SAF/IAPQ, after  consultation  with  SAF/GCI,  will  inform  all  signatories  in  accordance  with  the procedures  outlined  in  the  IA.    Under  the  terms  of  most  agreements,  withdrawing  parties retain  certain  obligations  after  withdrawal.    Generally,  responsibility  for  financial  costs incurred  up  to  the  date  of  withdrawal,  and  for  continued  compliance  with  security, intellectual  property  rights  (IPR),  or  other  provisions  continue  after  withdrawal  from  the agreement.    The  proponent  will  ensure  that  U.S.  obligations  are  fully  discharged  and  will report any partner non-compliance to SAF/IAPQ.  Similar procedures will be followed when all parties agree to terminate the agreement. 2.8.  HQ USAF, MAJCOM, and Proponent Responsibilities. 2.8.1.  SAF/IA  will:  Sign  IAs,  or  delegate  signature  authority  for  IAs,  after  obtaining OUSD(AT&L)/IC approval. 2.8.2.  SAF/IAPQ will: 2.8.2.1.

Purpose  and  Objectives.  The exchange of RDT&E information  provides one  foundation for the promotion of IAC.  USAF personnel are encouraged to pursue information exchange with partners  to  meet  the  broad  IAC  objectives  contained  in  AFI  16-110  as  well  as  the  following specific objectives: 3.1.1.  Explore  opportunities standardization and interoperability. to  promote  future technology  cooperation to  enhance 3.1.2.  Establish and nurture relationships between the technology communities in the USAF and partner nations. 3.1.3.  Remain abreast of defense-related technology development outside the United States. 3.1.4.  Impart  to  partner  nations  the  U.S.  vision  of  the  potential  impact  of  information exchanges on various defense equipment programs. 3.1.5.  Reduce costs by avoiding unnecessary duplication of RDT&E efforts. 3.2.  IEP  Background.  The  IEP  allows  for  the  exchange  of  RDT&E  information  on  a reciprocal, balanced basis such that the RDT&E information exchanged between parties will be of approximately equivalent value, qualitatively and quantitatively.  The IEP is used to exchange generic,  non-system  specific  technology.    The  scope  of  the  IEP  should  be  broad  enough  to provide sufficient flexibility over the life of the IEP to allow for changes in RDT&E information and evolving military requirements.  Industry participation must be in compliance with the terms and  conditions  of  the  Master  Information  Exchange  Agreement  (MIEA),  the  Information Exchange  Annex  (IEA),  DoD  industrial  security  and  export  regulations,  and  U.S.  National Disclosure Policy (NDP).  Industry or university participation is limited to entities under contract to  DoD or foreign counterparts.   Foreign industry  participation is  authorized only for  countries with  which  the  DoD  has  an  industrial  security  agreement.    In  some  circumstances,  RDT&E information  exchange  is  also  authorized  under  other  umbrella  RDT&E  IAs  as  well  as  program agreements.   For example, information  exchange  is  oftentimes allowed as a mechanism  for the participants to determine which PAs to develop and conclude under RDT&E Program and Test and Evaluation (T&E) PAs.  IEPs  are  authorized  by  Title  10  U.S.C.  §  2358.    The  MILDEPs  conduct  RDT&E  information exchanges under DoDI 2015.4, Defense Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) Information  Exchange  Program  (IEP).    DoDD  5230.11,  Disclosure  of  Classified  Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations, DoDD 5230.20, Visits and Assignments  of  Foreign  Nationals,  and  DoDD  5530.  ,  also  establish  the  legal  basis  for  the establishment of IEP agreements and associated annexes. 3.2.1.  Master  Data  Exchange  Agreements  or  Master  Information  Exchange Agreements.  The U.S. participates in the IEP through bilateral and multilateral Master Data Exchange  Agreements/Information  Exchange  Agreements  (MDEAs/MIEAs)  with  partner nations.  These master agreements outline the terms,  conditions,  security  classification, and procedures for the reciprocal exchange of scientific and technical information.  For the U.S., MDEAs/MIEAs are negotiated and signed at the OSD level.   20  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 3.2.2.  Data  Exchange  Annexes  or  Information  Exchange  Annexes.  Annexes to MDEAs/MIEAs  govern  the  type  and  range  of  information  permissible  for  an  exchange.  OUSD(AT&L)/IC delegates authority to negotiate and conclude these annexes, termed Data Exchange  Annexes/Information  Exchange  Annexes  (DEAs/IEAs)  to  the  services.    There  is no limit to the number of DEAs/IEAs the USAF may have with a specific country.  However, DEAs/IEAs  are  constrained  by  provisions  negotiated  within  their  master  agreement.  The procedures  for  MDEAs/DEAs  and  MIEAs/IEAs  are  the  same  and,  for  simplicity  purposes, only  the  terms  MIEA  and  IEA  will  be  used  in  the  remainder  of  this  Chapter.    The  typical duration  of  an  IEA  is  five  years,  with  an  option  for  extension  up  to  another  five  years; however, the  governing  MIEA may contain  different  timeframes as agreed with  the partner nation. 3.2.2.1.  IEAs  exclude  transfer  of  materials  or  equipment;  technical  data  packages; production  or  manufacturing  information  and  data  packages;  price  and  availability information on U.S. production or operational systems; and training. Any data provided will  be  safeguarded  and  will  not  be  further  disseminated  without  prior  written  approval from  SAF/IAPQ.    An  IEA  may  not  be  used  for  the  exchange  of  personnel,  to  provide technical  services,  be  cited  as  authority  to  place  contracts  or  for  a  cooperative  RDT&E project,  which formally  commits the participants  to  fund specific RDT&E shared work.  Expenditure  of  funds  is  limited  to  administrative  and  travel  costs  to  support  the  proper management of the IEA. Actors in the IEA process include: 3.2.3.  Annex  Authorities.  Government  officials  authorized  to  act  on  behalf  of  the  parties.  For the USAF, SAF/IAP is the U.S. IEA Authority. 3.2.4.  Technical  Project  Officers  (TPOs).  A government employee identified by a USAF program  office  specifically  authorized  to  exchange  RDT&E  information  under  an  IEA.  USAF  and  foreign  TPOs  are  responsible  for  overall  management  of  information  exchange activities under a specific IEA, including execution of associated exchanges and visits. 3.2.4.1.  Associate  Technical  Project  Officer  (ATPO).   A  government  employee identified by  a  USAF program  office, nominated and assigned by the TPO, who assists the TPO in fulfilling the objectives of an IEA and in executing exchanges and visits. 3.2.4.2.  Project  Officers/Project terms  were previously used  and may  be  found in  some older MIEAs.   Terms  are synonymous with TPO. Personnel who facilitate distribution of information as needed. Implementation  Authorities.  These 3.2.5.  Establishments.  Organizations that are potential sources or recipients of information exchanged  under  an  IEA.    The  IEA  Establishment  listing  may  include  several  DoD organizations and may even list government entities outside the U.S. DoD or partner nation MOD  if  authorized  by  the  MIEA.    Neither  U.S.  nor  foreign  contractors,  including  “special status”  contractors  such  as  Federally  Funded  Research  and  Development  Center  (FFRDCs) or  foreign  equivalents,  may  be  listed  as  Establishments.    Contractors  excluded  from  the annex  Establishment  list  may  participate  in  annex-related  meetings  or  other  interchanges based on mutual agreement between the parties.  Establishments do not have the authority to disclose or transfer information under the IEA. AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   21  3.2.6.  Foreign  Disclosure  Officers  or  Designated  Disclosure  Authority  (DDA).  A  U.S. Government  official  designated  by  SAF/IAPD  who  assists  the  TPO  in  approving  the disclosure  of  classified  information  and  Controlled  Unclassified  Information  (CUI) authorized under the DDL for the IEA. 3.3.  Documentation Requirements for an IEA. 3.3.1.  The USAF, another DoD Component, or government of a partner nation may propose an  IEA.    An  International  Cooperative  Agreement  Team  (ICAT)  as  described  in  Chapter  2 may  be  used  to  assist  proponents  in  pursuing  an  IEA.    The  following  documentation, considerations, and procedures are involved in establishing an IEA. 3.3.2.  At  the  proponent  level,  the  U.S.  TPO  designate  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the three documents necessary to staff a proposed IEA within the USAF: 3.3.2.1.  Proposed  IEA.  This  document  should  follow  the  format  in  the  governing MIEA.  If the MIEA does not have an IEA format, the U.S. TPO designate should use the IEA and DEA templates shown in Attachment 3.  The IEA should include a definition of the  technical  scope;  a  listing  of  Authorities,  TPOs,  ATPOs,  LOs,  and  Establishments; security  classification  of  information  to  be  exchanged;  and  other  special  provisions  as required. 3.3.2.2.  Quid-Pro-Quo  (QPQ)  Analysis.  This  is  a  U.S.  Government-only  document explaining  the  benefits  the  USAF  and  the  partner  country(s)  expect  to  realize  from  the proposed IEA.  The U.S. TPO designate will develop the QPQ analysis with inputs from appropriate sources.  The QPQ analysis format is shown in Attachment 3.3. 3.3.2.3.  Draft  Delegation  of  Disclosure  Authority  Letter  (DDL).  A  DDL  providing disclosure guidance to the U.S. TPO and other U.S. participants is required for each IEA.  In the event  there is  a conflict  between the DDL and the MIEA or  IEA, the DDL takes precedence  with  regard  to  the  scope  and  type  of  U.S.  information  or  data  proposed  for exchange.  The draft DDL will be prepared by the local FDO in conjunction with the U.S. TPO and the MAJCOM FDO.  A sample of the DDL format can be found in AFI 16-201 Attachment 3, or in Paragraph A2.2. of this AFMAN. 3.3.2.3.1.  DDLs  will  be  classified  if  the  information  contained  therein  is  classified, based on derivative classification guidance or the compilation principle.  Classifying a  DDL  based  upon  compilation  requires  endorsement  by  an  original  classification authority.  The highest security classification level of information to be exchanged in a specific IEA must be consistent with the corresponding DDL and comply with the MIEA.    Regardless  of  its  classification,  a  DDL  is  not  authorized  for  release  or disclosure  to  any  foreign  government,  representative  thereof,  foreign  national,  or international governmental organization. 3.3.2.3.2.  The  local  FDO  must  review  and  approve  all  technical  information proposed for exchange under the concluded IEA before the TPO forwards it to his or her  foreign  counterpart.    Administrative  and  public  domain  information  and correspondence may be sent directly.  3.4.  IEA Process.   22  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 3.4.1.  IEA  Initiation.  The objective of the initiation stage is to define the project, develop appropriate  staffing  documentation,  and  verify  proponent  support.    TPOs  or  prospective proponents  who  receive  a  proposed  IEA  directly  from  a  foreign  country  will  consult  with SAF/IAPQ to determine the best way to proceed. 3.4.1.1.  Technical  Assessment.    To  develop  the  documents  in  3.3.,  the  designated  U.S. TPO  must  accomplish  a  technical  assessment  for  proposed  IEAs.    The  assessment  may include  exploratory  visits  to  foreign  research  organizations.    Various  in-country  U.S. offices  such  as  the  Offices  of  Defense  Cooperation  (ODCs),  the  European  Office  of Aerospace  Research  and  Development  (EOARD),  the  Asian  Office  of  Aerospace Research  and  Development  (AOARD),  the  Southern  Office  of  Aerospace  Research  and Development (SOARD) can help provide appropriate points of contact.  At a minimum, the following points should be identified during the technical assessment: 3.4.1.1.1.  Tangible technical benefit to a U.S. program; 3.4.1.2.  Specific U.S. application of the foreign technology; 3.4.1.3.  Unique advantages of the foreign research programs, facilities, and personnel; 3.4.1.4.  Impact on the U.S. program without the foreign technology; 3.4.1.5.  Sensitivity or military criticality of proposed U.S. technology to be exchanged; 3.4.1.6.  Potential application of U.S. technology by a foreign country; 3.4.1.7.  Technology availability from other foreign sources; 3.4.1.8.  Ensure the equitable exchange of information, consistent with  national  security policy and DoD security policy; and 3.4.1.9.  Potential  of  damage  to  the  U.S.  from  disclosure  of  U.S.  technology  to  a  non-participant in the IEA. 3.4.2.  Participation  in  IEAs  concluded  by  other  MILDEPs  or  DoD  Agencies.  USAF proponents  for  information  exchanges  are  encouraged  to  review  opportunities  to  join proposed or active IEAs concluded by other agencies.  Joining an active IEA can prove to be very  effective  in  exchanging  desired  information  while  saving  the  time  and  overhead  of starting a new IEA.  In either of these cases, the USAF proponent should seek to become an ATPO  to  the  exchange.    Following  the  applicable  elements  outlined  in  paragraph  3.3.,  the USAF  proponent  should  draft  a  QPQ  analysis  and  a  draft  DDL  specifying  disclosure guidance for release of USAF-specific technical information, then forward the documents to SAF/IAPQ.  SAF/IAPQ will staff the documentation as described below in paragraph 3.4.3. 3.4.3.  Procedures  for  Staffing.  After  the  proposed  IEA  and  QPQ  are  drafted  by  the  TPO and a draft DDL have been received from the local FDO, the three documents are submitted to IAPQ requesting HQ USAF approval under cover of a transmittal memo signed by an O-6 or above in the proponent’s organization. 3.4.3.1.  SAF/IAPQ  will  review  and  coordinate  the  proposed  IEA  and  supporting documentation  with  appropriate  HQ  USAF  offices  to  include  appropriate  SAF/AQ Directorates,  SAF/GCI,  SAF/IAPD,  SAF/IA  regional  division(s),  and  other  USAF  and DoD component organizations as necessary depending on the type of information being considered for exchange.  Upon approval from all relevant HQ USAF offices, IAPQ will AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   23  have  the  official  authority  to  develop  the  IEA  and  can  begin  negotiating  the  draft agreement directly with the foreign partner involved. 3.4.4.  Development  and  Negotiation.  Negotiations  with  the  partner  country  are  primarily conducted  via  email  but  may  be  done  in  face-to-face  visits,  if  necessary.    SAF/IAPQ  will answer  questions  and  incorporate  changes  proposed  during  the  foreign  country  staffing process  after  appropriate  coordination  with  HQ  USAF  offices,  field-level  organizations, and/or TPOs. 3.4.5.  Final  Review  and  Approval.  SAF/IAPQ  will  forward  the  proposed  IEA  to  the Department  of  Commerce,  Bureau  of  Industry  and  Security,  Office  of  Strategic  Industries and  Economic  Security  (DOC  BIS/SIES)  with  a  courtesy  copy  to  OUSD(AT&L)/IC,  for review  in  order  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  potential  negative  impact  on  the  U.S.  industrial base.    DOC  BIS/SIES  is  requested  to  respond  within  a  15-day  period.    In  the  event  DOC submits  a  non-concurrence  based  on  substantive  objections  and/or  insufficient  information provided,  OUSD(AT&L)/IC  and  DOC  BIS/SIES  will  discuss  the  matter  and  make  a  good faith effort to resolve the issue.  If no accommodation can be made, OUSD(AT&L)/IC will notify DOC BIS/SIES in writing before taking final action. 3.4.5.1.  After  review  by  both  the  foreign  partner  and  DoC,  SAF/IAPQ  will  make  any necessary  revisions  and  resubmit  to  HQ  USAF  for  final  coordination  if  changes  are substantial.  SAF/IAPQ will then prepare two original versions of the IEA for SAF/IAP signature. 3.4.5.2.  Once SAF/IAP has signed the IEA, SAF/IAPQ will forward both originals to the foreign  country  for  countersignature.    The  foreign  country  will  mail  back  the  signed, original IEA to SAF/ IAPQ.  SAF/IAPQ will file the original agreement. the  countersigned  originals, 3.4.6.  Post-signature  Requirements.  Upon  receipt  of SAF/IAPQ will use a transmittal memorandum to distribute electronic copies of the IEA and, if required, a Certificate of Language Conformity (Attachment 2.5.) all relevant stakeholders.  This transmittal memorandum, similar in format to the one described in paragraph 2.6.1., is sent to a reduced distribution list since an IEA is not considered an IA.  This memorandum is not sent to DoS or OSD/GC. 3.4.6.1.  At the conclusion of this process, SAF/IAPQ will request that SAF/IAPD issue the approved DDL under agreed procedures. 3.4.7.  Implementing, Amending, Withdrawing From, and Terminating an IEA. 3.4.7.1.    Implementation. U.S. TPOs should identify information exchange objectives as needed within the QPQ analysis to clarify expectations during the life of the established IEA.  Regular visits and/or communication between the U.S. and foreign TPOs is encouraged to discuss progress made against the objectives and to maintain awareness of technological advances and activities of the other party.  All visits must comply with DoDD 5230.20 and AFI 16-201. 3.4.7.2.  Amendments.    An  IEA  must  be  amended  when  the  TPOs  intend  to  change  the scope, security classification level, duration, or other significant aspect of the IEA. 3.4.7.2.1.  The  USAF  TPO  will  evaluate  proposed  changes  using  criteria  similar  to establishing  a  new  IEA  and  contact  SAF/IAPQ  for  assistance  in  developing  the amended  IEA,  an  updated  QPQ  analysis,  and  DDL.    The  updated  QPQ  analysis   24  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 should describe the benefits  already  gained  from  the  IEA  and those likely to  accrue from  the  amendment.    The  DDL  should  be  reviewed  for  currency  and  changed,  if necessary,  or  reissued  if  its  content  remains  valid  for  the  duration  of  the  amended IEA. 3.4.7.2.2.  The applicable elements outlined in paragraph 3.4. above will be used for approving the amended IEA. 3.4.7.2.3.  Administrative  Changes  to  an  IEA.    TPOs  can  propose  administrative changes  to  existing  IEAs,  including  updating  the  listed  Establishments  and Authorities.   USAF  TPOs  will  forward  proposed  administrative  changes  to SAF/IAPQ  for  approval.    After  approval,  USAF  TPOs  will  inform  their  foreign counterparts of the changes in writing, with copies to SAF/IAPQ. 3.4.7.3.  Terminating an Annex.  An IEA may be terminated by either country using the procedures  stipulated  in  the  MIEA  and  appropriate  IEA.    A  TPO  should  make  the termination request to the Annex Authority through SAF/IAPQ. 3.5.  HQ USAF, MAJCOM, and Proponent Responsibilities. 3.5.1.  SAF/IAP will: 3.5.1.1.  Provide  executive-level  oversight  for  all  USAF  IEAs  as  the  USAF  Annex Authority. 3.5.1.2.  Approve and sign IEAs following negotiation and HQ USAF coordination. 3.5.2.  SAF/IAPQ will: 3.5.2.1.  Advise  U.S.  TPOs  on  IEA  process  and  procedures,  including  assisting  in  the drafting of the IEA and QPQ as needed. 3.5.2.2.  Provide guidance to the U.S. TPO in initial technical discussions. 3.5.2.3.  Review,  staff,  negotiate,  and  obtain  HQ  USAF  approval  for  IEAs  and amendments to IEAs. 3.5.2.4.  Distribute copies of signed IEAs as described in this Chapter. 3.5.2.5.  Ensure  that  periodic  management  reviews  with  partner  nations  review  IEAs  so that  both  sides  can  evaluate  program  effectiveness,  resolve  any  problem  areas,  and capitalize on opportunities for increased cooperation. 3.5.2.6.  Approve IEA administrative changes and terminations as appropriate. 3.5.2.7.  Assess annual IEP information exchanges, visits, meetings, and the need for new or amended annexes. 3.5.2.8.  Conduct initial and periodic TPO IEP management and responsibilities training. 3.5.2.9.  Maintain  a  tracking  and  reporting  database,  and  a  distribution  system  for  IEP information. 3.5.3.  SAF/IAPD will: AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   25  3.5.3.1.  Review  IEAs  and  supporting  documentation,  including  the  DDL,  to  ensure consistency  with  national  and  USAF  disclosure  policy  guidelines  and  export  control regulations. 3.5.3.2.  Approve and issue the DDL to  the appropriate MAJCOM FDO within 10 days of receipt of the signed IEA from SAF/IAPQ. 3.5.4.  SAF/IARW will: 3.5.4.1.  Review IEAs and supporting documentation to ensure consistency with national disclosure  policy,  export  control  regulations  and  that  USAF  operational  and  technical concerns are addressed. 3.5.5.  MAJCOMs will: 3.5.5.1.  Promote  the  USAF  IEP  by  seeking  cooperative  opportunities  for  RDT&E information exchange that can be quantified in a mutually beneficial IEA. 3.5.5.2.  Review  proposed  DDLs  prior  to  their  submission  to  any  HQ  USAF  office  in order  to  ensure  consistency  between  the  proponent-drafted  proposed  IEA  and  FDO-drafted supporting DDL. 3.5.5.3.  Re-delegate approved DDLs to appropriate field FDOs. 3.5.6.  U.  S. Technical Project Officers (TPOs) will: 3.5.6.1.  Exercise day-to-day management of assigned IEA efforts in accordance with the terms and conditions of the IEA and the approved DDL.  Ensure information exchanged is essentially equivalent in volume, criticality, and relevance. 3.5.6.2.  Conduct technical assessments for proposed IEAs. 3.5.6.3.  Prepare  supporting  documentation  packages  for  proposed  IEAs,  amendments, administrative changes, terminations, and potential follow-on cooperative projects. 3.5.6.4.  Ensure that ATPOs and Establishments understand, and are in compliance with, the terms and conditions of the IEA and the associated DDL. 3.5.6.5.  Forward  all technical  information,  except  for  administrative and public domain information  and  correspondence,  to  the  local  FDO  for  release  approval  prior  to forwarding through channels to the foreign establishment(s). 3.5.6.6.  Maintain  an  active  dialogue  and  exchange  of  information  with  the  foreign TPO(s). 3.5.6.7.  Endeavor  to  meet  with  foreign  TPO(s)  regularly  to  maintain  awareness  of foreign technical capabilities, maximize IEA benefits, and explore opportunities for new or  expanded  cooperation  activities.    Generally,  TPOs  travel  to  the  partner  country  on alternate years, although more frequent visits are encouraged if benefits are justified. 3.5.6.8.  Maintain a complete set of IEA files to include the latest version of the IEA, all appropriate  correspondence,  current  annual  objectives  (if  appropriate),  and  a  record  of visits and information exchanged with the other country. 3.5.6.9.  Establish the first year’s annex information objectives.   26  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 3.5.6.10.  Complete the IEP annex annual progress report, including a brief description of the  year’s  activities;  an  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  annex  in  achieving exchange objectives; and next year’s information exchange objectives. 3.5.6.11.  Recommend annually to SAF/IAPQ whether or not the IEA should continue, be amended, replaced or terminated; and if the DDL needs revision. 3.5.7.  U.  S. Associate Technical Project Officers (ATPOs) will: 3.5.7.1.  Assist the TPO in executing exchanges and visits for IEAs to which he/she has been  assigned.    In  the  case  of  assignment  as  an  ATPO  to  an  IEA  signed  by  another MILDEP or DoD, work in conjunction with the TPO to achieve USAF objectives in the exchange. AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   27  Chapter 4 THE TEST AND EVALUATION (T&E) PROGRAM 4.1.  Purpose  and  Objectives.  The  DoD-managed  T&E  Program  allows  USAF  proponents  to secure access to test facilities of a partner nation or international governmental organizations and vice  versa.    It  also  allows  for  cooperative  activities  on  a  reciprocal  basis  through  T&E-related projects,  information  exchange,  working  group  formation,  project  equipment  transfers,  and familiarization visits. 4.2.  T&E  Background.  The  T&E  program  is  implemented  through  a  bilateral  Test  and Evaluation  Program  (TEP)  Memorandum  of  Agreement  or  Understanding  (MOA  or  MOU), which  establishes  the  broad  terms  and  conditions  for  reciprocal  and/or  cooperative  T&E activities.    Acquisition  or  production  programs  and  the  provision  of  educational  and  training services are outside the scope of TEP MOAs/MOUs.  The T&E Program is authorized by Title 10 U.S.C. § 2350l and allows the SECDEF to enter into an  international  agreement  (IA)  with  a  foreign  country  or  international  governmental organization  to  provide  for  the  testing  of  defense  equipment  at  the  other’s  test  facilities.    The legislation envisions payment of costs based on the direct costs incurred by the providing party plus  indirect  costs  as  mutually  agreed  in  the  governing  IA,  as  determined  by  DOT&E  per SECDEF delegation of authority.  T&E  activities  are  normally  carried  out  using  two  types  of  subordinate  PA  and  LA  type  of mechanisms  among  others  required  on  a  case-by-case  basis.    The  appropriate  bilateral MOA/MOU usually contains templates for these documents.  If not, proponents should consult with SAF/IAPQ for assistance in developing requisite documentation. 4.2.1.  Reciprocal Use of Test Facilities (RUTF) PA.  RUTF PAs describe a fee-for-service relationship  in  which  testing  services  are  provided  at  preferred  (less  than  full  cost  of recovery)  rates.    Testing  under  a  RUTF  PA  may  be  conducted  for  the  purposes  of developmental,  operational,  and  live-fire  T&E.    RUTF  PAs  are  considered  IAs  but  do  not require  coordination  at  the  OSD  level.    The  U.S.  signatory  authority  is  the  Director, Operational Test & Evaluation. 4.2.2.  Cooperative  T&E  (CTE)  PA.  CTE  PAs  allow  for  the  conduct  of  T&E  projects under the terms of the applicable bilateral TEP  MOA/MOU.  Unlike RUTF PAs, CTE PAs do require coordination at the OSD level.  They are also signed by the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation. 4.2.2.1.  The  PA  brings  allies  or  coalition  partners  together  to  assess  materiel interoperability  for  collation  operations  and  determine  solutions  to  identified  problems; evaluate U.S. and coalition partner(s) technical and operational concepts, and recommend improvements; increase coalition mission capability, using materiel quantitative data  for analysis;  validate  developmental  and/or  operational  testing  methodologies  that  have coalition  operations  applications;  improve  modeling  and  simulation  validity  and interoperability  with  field  exercise  data;  provide  feedback  to  the  acquisition  and joint/coalition  operations  communities;  and  improve  joint/coalition  materiel  tactics, techniques, and procedures.   28  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 4.2.3.  Project  Equipment  Transfer  (PET)  or  Equipment  and  Material  Transfer (E&MT).  PET or E&MT is a term used in a number of bilateral MOAs under the RDT&E Program.    When  processed  as  a  stand-alone,  they  are  essentially  loan  agreements  and  the USAF processes them as LAs (see Chapter 2). 4.3.  T&E Documentation Requirements.  A PA, SSOI, and DDL are required for T&E PAs as described  in  Chapter  2  of  this  AFMAN.    Prior  to  developing  this  documentation,  the  project proponent must first develop a one-page project proposal for OSD DOT&E’s consideration. 4.3.1.  One-page  Project  Proposal  (Required  Only  When  USAF  is  the  Requestor).  For RUTF, CTE, and E&MT PAs under a TEP MOA/MOU, the project proponent is responsible for  drafting  a  short  proposal  summary  to  develop  the  agreement  (format  at  Attachment  4).  The proposal is submitted to SAF/IAPQ for further submission to the office of the Director of Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) in OSD. 4.3.1.1.  Once  DOT&E  issues  an  Approval  in  Principal  (AIP)  letter  granting  the proponent’s  request,  the  proponent,  working  with  SAF/IAPQ,  drafts  the  PA,  SSOI,  and DDL (as needed). 4.4.  T&E Process. 4.4.1.  Initiation.  See paragraphs 2.4.1. and 2.4.2. for guidance on initiating PAs, including background on exploratory discussions and the use of ICATs as needed. 4.4.1.1.  U.S.  Requested  Services  or  Equipment  from  Foreign  Partners.    For  RUTF projects  requested  by  the  United  States,  the  USAF  proponent  must  draft  a  one-page proposal  summary  to  develop  a  RUTF  PA  as  described  in  paragraph  4.3.1.    DOT&E submits  the  proposal  summary  to  the  foreign  partner  and  requests  the  Managing  Agent (MA)  provide  an  Approval  in  Principle  (AIP)  letter  if  the  partner  providing  the  service can support the request. 4.4.1.2.  Foreign  Partner  Requested    Services  or  Equipment  from  the  United  States.  Foreign  partners  submit  RUTF  proposal  requests  to  DOT&E  who  in  turns  forwards USAF  related  proposals  to  SAF/IAPQ.    SAF/IAPQ  coordinates  the  request  with  the Director  of  the  Air  Force,  Test  and  Evaluation  (AF/TE)  to  determine  if  the  facility  can support  the  requested  test  and  if  the  test  can  be  supported  during  the  requested  time period.    If the proposed test  can be supported, SAF/IAPQ provides concurrence on the issuance of an AIP letter to the partner supporting the request. 4.4.1.3.  CTE PAs.  AIPs are required for CTE PAs and follow the same guidance as for RUTF PAs described in paragraphs 4.3.1.1 and 4.3.1.2. above.  However, AIPs for CTE or dually signed by both the U.S. and the foreign partner. 4.4.1.4.  PETs  can  usually  take  place  directly  under  bilateral  T&E  MOAs/MOUs  or  as part of a RUTF PA or CTE PA. 4.4.2.  Procedures  for  Staffing,  Development,  and  Negotiation.  After  DOT&E approval, SAF/IAPQ assists the proponent in drafting standard IA staffing documents (draft PA, SSOI, and  DDL,  if  required),  staffs  the  documents  within  HQ  USAF  for  approval,  and  then negotiates the PA, as outlined in paragraph 2.4.4.  SAF/IAPQ will then submit the draft PA to and  SSOI   For  CTE  PAs,  DOT&E  sends to  DOT&E. the  documentation AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   29  OUSD(AT&L)/IC for RAD.  Note:  For RUTF PAs, coordination is not required at the OSD level.  At this stage, the RUTF PA is ready for DOT&E signature. 4.4.3.  Final  Review  and  Approval.  Once  the  USAF  and  the  foreign  partner  reach agreement  on  the  PA  text,  SAF/IAPQ  seeks  final  approval  to  conclude  CTE  PAs  through OSD  DOT&E.    DOT&E  will  put  in  a  RFA  notification  to  OUSD(AT&L)  at  least  fifteen working  days  prior  to  the  planned  signature  date  of  the  PA.    OUSD(AT&L)  will  staff  the final draft of the agreement with appropriate OSD offices, MILDEPs, DoS, and DoC under a fifteen  day  silence  procedure.    Additionally,  the  PA  is  sent  to  Congress  for  notification  at least  thirty  days  prior  to  U.S.  signature.    After  the  time  period  lapses,  and  no  issues  are identified, DOT&E is authorized to sign the agreement. 4.4.4.  Post-Signature  Requirements.  After  signature,  DOT&E  complies  with  appropriate Case-Zablocki  Act  procedures  and  provides  a  copy  of  the  signed  PA  to  SAF/IAPQ.  SAF/IAPQ then provides a copy to the proponent for execution of the project in accordance with the terms of the PA and to SAF/IAPD when there is a DDL involved. 4.5.  Responsibilities. 4.5.1.  SAF/IAPQ will: 4.5.1.1.  Assist  USAF  proponents  participating  in  the  T&E  Program  through  technical assistance  and  advisory  support  in  drafting  relevant  documents,  along  with  any interfacing required with DOT&E. 4.5.1.2.  Coordinate,  negotiate,  and  conclude  T&E  Program  IAs  in  accordance  with  the applicable procedures in Chapter 2 and the special procedures described in this Chapter. 4.5.2.  SAF/IAPD will: 4.5.2.1.  Review T&E PAs and supporting documentation, including the DDL, to ensure consistency  with  national  and  USAF  disclosure  policy  guidelines,  and  export  control regulations. 4.5.2.2.  Approve and issue the DDL to the proponent FDO if required. 4.5.3.  SAF/IARW will: 4.5.3.1.  Review  IAs  and  supporting  documentation  to  ensure  consistency  with  national disclosure  policy,  export  control  regulations  and  that  USAF  operational  and  technical concerns are addressed. 4.5.4.  AF/TE will: 4.5.4.1.  Review  staffing  packages  to  ensure  consistency  with  USAF  T&E  policy  and compliance with USAF T&E objectives. 4.5.4.2.  Assist  in  identifying  and  determining  if  USAF  facilities  can  support  RUTF requests from foreign partners and if the test can be supported during the requested time period. 4.5.4.3.  Provide  appropriate  personnel  as  members  of  ICATs,  negotiation  teams,  and delegations at international forums and meetings, as required. 4.5.5.  Proponents will:   30  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 4.5.5.1.  Seek  T&E  cooperation  opportunities  with  potential  partner  nations  and international governmental organizations for mutual benefit. 4.5.5.2.  Develop  staffing  documentation,  with  assistance  from  SAF/IAPQ,  required  for participation in the T&E Program. 4.5.5.3.  Execute approved T&E projects in accordance with the terms of applicable IAs. AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   31  Chapter 5 THE FOREIGN COMPARATIVE TESTING (FCT) PROGRAM 5.1.  Purpose  and  Objectives.  The  FCT  Program  provides  funding  for  Test  and  Evaluation (T&E) of foreign Non-Developmental Items (NDI) and evaluates the NDIs developed by partner nations to determine if they satisfy military requirements or correct mission area shortcomings.  The program aims to improve the U.S. warfighter’s capabilities through rapidly fielding quality military equipment, 12 to 18 months after start funding of a project.  Additionally, the program aims  to  reduce  duplication  in  R&D,  enhance  standardization  and  interoperability,  improve cooperative support, and promote competition and international technology exchange. 5.2.  FCT  Program Background.  The FCT Program focuses efforts on identifying and testing items  and  technologies  of  our  allies  and  other  friendly  nations  that  have  a  high  Technology Readiness  Level  (TRL)  in  order  to  satisfy  valid  defense  requirements  more  quickly  and economically.  It supports DoD and USAF policies of encouraging international cooperation and helps reduce overall DoD acquisition costs by facilitating the procurement of foreign NDI.  The program  is  managed  by  the  Director,  Comparative  Technology  Office  (CTO).    CTO  is administered under the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Rapid Fielding (DASD(RFD)) through  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Research  and  Engineering  (ASD(R&E)).  The FCT Program  is  funded  under the defense-wide  RDT&E appropriation.    More information  and guidance  can  be  found  at  the  OSD  CTO  website  (http://www.acq.osd.mil/cto/)  and  the  OSD CTO  Handbook.    Proponents  should  consult  the  website  regularly  and  refer  to  the  Handbook when contemplating an FCT proposal.  SAF/IAPQ will normally request OSD funds for a FCT project duration of no more than two years.  If adequately justified, OSD may approve funding for  complex  or  high-cost  systems  for  a  longer  period.    USAF  personnel  will  not  use  the  FCT Program  for  exploitation,  intelligence-gathering  purposes,  or  to  test  U.S.  systems.  FCT  is authorized  under  Title  10  U.S.C.  §  2350a(g).    The  FCT  Program  is  directed  by  Defense  FAR Supplement (DFARS), current edition, Part 207 and 211, DoDD 5000.01, and DoDI 5000.02. 5.2.1.  Contracting Guidance.  It is FCT policy for proponents to structure their acquisition and contracting strategies so there is a single contract to obtain the test articles with options for  the  first  lot  of  production  articles.    This  approach  is  commonly  set-up  as  an  “indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)” contract.  USAF contracting officers may purchase test articles  and  associated  test  support  services  from  foreign  sources  in  accordance  with  the requirements of the FAR.  Test articles may also be obtained by lease or loan through an IA. 5.2.2.  Federal  Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps)  (http:  //www.fedbizopps.gov).  The intention  to  initiate  an  FCT  project  must  be  publicized  in  Federal  Business  Opportunities (FedBizOpps)  as  required  by  OSD  policy  to  promote  full  and  open  competition.    Sources responding to the FedBizOpps announcement that have been determined capable of meeting test objectives should be provided a solicitation that calls for proposals to include the prices for  the  test  articles  and  priced  options  for  production  quantities.    Procuring  activities  can then,  without  further  competition,  contract  for  production  quantities  if  the  item  tests successfully  and  is  determined  to  be  the  best  value.    Proponents  should  consult  with SAF/IAPQ regarding the timing and content of the FedBizOpps announcement.   32  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 5.2.3.  Foreign  T&E  Data.  Pertinent  T&E  data  obtained  from  foreign  governments  and manufacturers  may  be  useful  in  reducing  duplication  of  T&E  effort  and  costs.    Existing Memorandums  of  Agreement  (MOAs)  and  Information  Exchange  Annexes  (IEAs),  when appropriate,  will  be  used  to  facilitate  exchange  of  FCT  data.    For  countries  where  no appropriate  agreements  exist,  T&E  data  may  be  obtained  via  a  contract  or  a  separately negotiated agreement.    Classified or sensitive  U.S. test data will be provided to  the  foreign governments  or  manufacturers  only  in  accordance  with  U.S.  disclosure  policy  and  export controls. 5.3.  Documentation Requirements. 5.3.1.  The  FCT  Proposals.  There  are  three  FCT  proposal  formats:    the  FCT  Project Nomination  Form,  the  Draft  Proposal,  and  the  Final  Proposal.    They  are  designed  to  be submitted  chronologically  to  reduce  paperwork  to  a  minimum  while  providing  the  highest quality USAF proposals. 5.3.1.1.  The  FCT  Project  Nomination  Form  (Attachment  5).    Proponents  submit  this document to SAF/IAPQ at any time as the first step in the FCT process.  The document is a one-page summary of  the FCT proposal  that answers basic questions about  the effort.  SAF/IAPQ uses this summary form to determine which proposed projects should move to the next step, the Draft Proposal. all by  OSD on information 5.3.1.2.  The  Draft  FCT  Proposal  Format.    The  Draft  Proposal  should  be  concise  and contain the  CTO  website (http://www.acq.osd.mil/cto/).    Proposals  must  use  the  most  current  version  of  the format.  Proponents should consult the CTO Handbook, also found on the CTO website, for an explanation of the required information and sample proposals.  Proponents should work closely with SAF/IAPQ when developing the Draft Proposal. required 5.3.1.3.  The  Final  FCT  Proposal.    The  Final  Proposal  is  in  approximately  the  same format  as  the  Draft  Proposal,  however,  it  requires  more  detail  and  OSD  considers  it  a finished product upon submission.  OSD evaluates all the Final Proposals it receives and approves  the  highest  rated  proposals  for  funding.    The  proponent  and  SAF/IAPQ  work together closely at this point in the FCT process. 5.4.  FCT  Program  Process.  Proponents  should  design  FCT  projects  to  evaluate  whether  test items  satisfy  validated  USAF  requirements  and  provide  best  value.    The  acquisition  strategy should  reflect  these  factors  and  support  a  procurement  decision  if  the  project  satisfies  both factors.    An  FCT  project  proposal  must  describe  clearly  the  candidate  item  for  test  and  the purpose of the evaluation. 5.4.1.  FCT  Project  Criteria.  The  selection  or  rejection  of  a  candidate  item  as  an  FCT project will depend on the extent to which a proposal satisfies the following criteria: 5.4.1.1.  Provides a solution to a valid USAF requirement for which there is no existing U.S. system; or 5.4.1.2.  Is  an  alternative  to  a  U.S.  system  under  development  and  the  foreign  item appears to offer significant cost, schedule, or performance advantages; or 5.4.1.3.  Has the potential to correct an operational deficiency or shortcoming; or AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   33  5.4.1.4.  Presents an alternative for military equipment, munitions, or a related technology or manufacturing process. 5.4.2.  Proposal Considerations.  The proponent submits a written summary documenting a thorough  market  investigation  through  a  FedBizOps  Sources  Sought  or  Request  for Information to determine availability of similar equipment, and identifies potential U.S. and partner country vendors. 5.4.2.1.  If  a  domestic  contender  is  identified  through  the  FedBizOps  solicitation  or  is planned,  the  domestic  contender  must  be  evaluated  with  USAF  funds  or  the  proposal withdrawn from competition. 5.4.2.2.  The  proponent  indicates  a  serious  intent  to  procure  equipment  that  meets requirements and demonstrates best value to the USAF by having an endorsement from a General  Officer  or  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)  civilian  and  identifies  procurement and support funds in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). 5.4.2.3.  The candidate project offers, where applicable, potential for establishing a U.S. source to produce, under license, foreign-designed equipment or technologies. 5.4.2.4.  The  proponent  is  willing  to  share  test  costs,  and  the  proposal  addresses  the willingness  of  the  foreign  government  or  industry  to  absorb  all  or  part  of  the  costs associated with providing test articles. 5.4.2.5.  The proposal addresses allied interoperability and support considerations (e.g., is the  item  or  system  in,  or  about  to  enter,  service  with  one  or  more  allies  or  friendly countries?). 5.4.2.6.  The proposal indicates the level of interest from other DoD Components in this effort. 5.4.2.7.  The proposal identifies required security and disclosure plans associated with the test  of  the  proposed  equipment  (e.g.,  security  classifications,  access  requirements,  and transfer of test articles, data, designs, and reports.) 5.4.2.8.  The proposal does not contain funding for a domestic candidate. 5.4.2.9.  The proposal does not contain or is an R&D effort. 5.4.3.  The  FCT  Proposal  Timeline.  The  following  timeline  is  used  to  generate,  review, and approve all FCT project proposals: 5.4.3.1.  December:  SAF/IA sends call letters to MAJCOMs, with copies to appropriate HQ USAF offices, soliciting USAF FCT nominations. 5.4.3.2.  February:    FCT  Project  Nomination  Forms  summarizing  proposals  are  due  to SAF/IAPQ for review. 5.4.3.3.  February-April:  After passing initial screening at HQ USAF, proponents work with  SAF/IAPQ,  the  appropriate  Program  Element  Monitors  (PEMs),  foreign  industry, and others to generate Draft Proposals and build or update integrated product teams. 5.4.3.4.  April:  Draft Proposals are due to SAF/IAPQ for review.   34  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 5.4.3.5.  May:  Final Proposals are due to SAF/IAPQ for review and delivery to OSD on approximately  1  June.    OSD  begins  its  final  review  and  preparation  for  proposal presentations to the OSD FCT Review Committee. 5.4.3.6.  June  through  early  July:    SAF/IAPQ  coordinates  with  the  OSD  FCT  Review Committee and other offices, as required, and briefs USAF project proposals.  Proponents may be required to brief or provide other support for their projects during this stage of the process. 5.4.3.7.  July:  OSD selects projects and notifies Congress. 5.4.3.8.  October:    OSD  notifies  the  USAF  of  Congressionally-approved  projects  and distributes funds so that projects can start as soon as funds are available.  OSD conducts an  annual  FCT  kickoff  meeting  for  all  approved  projects.    Proponents  must  attend  the kick-off meeting. 5.4.4.  FCT  Reports.  OSD  requires  the  USAF  to  submit  monthly  financial  reports  and Quarterly  Progress  Reports  (QPRs).    Both  reports  are  typically  one  to  two  pages  in  length and  should  be  consistent  with  the  OSD  CTO  format  provided  by  SAF/IAPQ  to  the proponent.  OSD also prepares an annual  year-in-review report to document FCT successes for  the  previous  fiscal  year.    Finally,  at  the  conclusion  of  an  FCT  project,  the  USAF  must submit  final  test  and  close  out  reports.    The  OSD  CTO  Procedures  Handbook  provides guidelines  on  content,  due  dates,  templates,  and  so  forth  to  ensure  consistency  in  report submissions.  The Handbook is located at the CTO website at http://www.acq.osd.mil/cto/. 5.5.  HQ USAF and Proponent Responsibilities. 5.5.1.  SAF/IAPQ will: 5.5.1.1.

Purpose  and  Objectives.  This  chapter  describes  the  processes  and  procedures  for  the Engineer  and  Scientist  Exchange  Program  (ESEP)  and  the  Administrative  and  Professional Exchange Program (APEP), both of which are part of the Defense Personnel Exchange Program (DPEP). 6.2.  ESEP and APEP Program Background. 6.2.1.  APEP.    A  program  to  assign  civilian  or  military  personnel  who  are  specialists  in administrative,  finance,  health,  legal,  logistics,  planning,  and  other  support  functions  to foreign  or  DoD  facilities.    These  assignments  take  place  through  the  exchange  of  military and/or civilian management professionals.  APEP provides on-site working assignments for foreign  personnel  in  U.S.  defense  (government)  establishments,  and  for  U.S.  personnel  in foreign  defense  (government  and  contractor)  establishments.   The  USD(Policy)  is responsible for the administration of the APEP. 6.2.2.  ESEP.    A  program  that  enhances  the  political  and  scientific  needs  of  the  U.S.  by assigning  civilian  and  military  engineers  and  scientists  to  foreign  (government)  or  DoD facilities to perform RDT&E work. 6.2.2.1.  The  USAF  pursues  these  programs  with  allied  and  friendly  nations  as  part  of IAC  portfolio.    These  programs  serve  the  purposes  of  1)  advancing  U.S.  political  and military  objectives  through  scientific  and  professional  exchange;  2)  enhancing  the technology  base  of  the  U.S.  via  international  engagement;  and  3)  building  and maintaining  cooperative  relationships  with  our  international  partners.  These  programs offer unique opportunities to  fill  gaps in  the USAF knowledge base.   A  key  element of the programs is the requirement that the placements meet the technological and political goals of the U.S., therefore all placement selections are made in a thorough and rigorous manner  to  ensure  that  the  programs  meet  overarching  political/military,  scientific  and professional goals. 6.2.2.2.  The ESEP and  APEP programs  help  the USAF stay  abreast  of concepts,  ideas, approaches,  and  technologies  developed  in  other  nations,  provide  a  foundation  upon which  to  build  future  collaborative  efforts  and  provide  career  broadening  opportunities for Airmen.  The ESEP and APEP programs are managed through MOAs, which assign MILDEPs as the Executive Agent (EA) for the agreement and require the appointment of a  Managing  Agent  (MA)  to  handle  the  day-to-day  execution  of  the  ESEP/APEP.    For those  MOAs  where  the  USAF  is  the  designated  EA,  SAF/IAPQ  carries  out  those responsibilities  that  include  negotiating  the  original  agreement,  periodic  review  of  the agreement for currency and possible amendment, and acting as the single point of contact (POC) for the other party.  For those MOAs where the USAF is the EA, SAF/IAPQ is the MA for both the ESEP and the APEP. 6.2.2.3.  ESEP and APEP placements will be done in a way that ensures mutual benefit of all the nations involved.  Assignments in ESEP and APEP provide full-time, on-site work for U.S. and foreign military and civilian personnel as an integral part of the government AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   37  establishment  of  the  other  nation.    These  assignments  also  build  organizational  and personal ties that often survive long after the duration of any specific assignment, thereby providing a foundation upon which to build future international cooperative efforts. 6.2.2.4.  The  legal  basis  for  all  DoD  personnel  exchange  and  assignment  programs  is found in Public Law 104-201, Section 1082 and Title 10 U.S.C. § 168.  DoDD 5230.20 and DoDD 5530.3 provide DoD policies and responsibilities for visits and assignments of foreign nationals to DoD Components. 6.3.  ESEP/APEP Program Requirements. 6.3.1.  Funding. 6.3.1.1.  The  parent  organization,  the  component  of  the  DoD/MOD  to  which  exchange personnel  belong,  bears  the  costs  of  carrying  out  its  participation  in  the  ESEP/APEP, including  the  permanent  change  of  station  (PCS)  costs  of  its  participants.    The  host organization, the location where exchange personnel are assigned for duty, will bear the expenses for official temporary duty (TDY) conducted on behalf of the host.  The parent organization  will  pay  for  any  other  travel  of  ESEP/APEP  personnel  for  administrative purposes. 6.3.1.2.  For  USAF  personnel  selected  for  overseas  assignment,  and  within  budgetary limitations, SAF/IAPQ will provide funding for civilian PCS moves, TDY for language training,  and  the  administrative  overhead  of  the  program.    The  parent  organization  will continue to pay the salary for civilian ESEP/APEP participants. 6.3.2.  Leave.  USAF  personnel  in  foreign  organizations  and  foreign  personnel  in  USAF organizations under an ESEP/APEP assignment may observe the holiday schedule of either the U.S. or host nation as mutually agreed.  Annual and sick leave will be granted according to  the  entitlements  of  the  parent  organization,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  appropriate authorities of the host organization. 6.3.3.  Position  Description.  A  Position  Description  (PD)  describing  the  work  that  the ESEP/APEP  participant  is  to  perform  will  be  developed  for  both  USAF  and  foreign personnel participating in the exchange program.  Participants in the ESEP/APEP remain in the employment of their parent organizations during their assignments.  USAF ESEP/APEP managers will ensure USAF personnel receive foreign assignments that require involvement in a specific area or application that is of mutual interest to both countries, and maximizes, as much as possible, benefits to the USAF.  Personnel on assignment under the ESEP/APEP are covered  by  an  applicable  Status  of  Forces  Agreement  (SOFA)  if  such  an  agreement  exists.  USAF  personnel  in  non-SOFA  countries  will  be  supported  through  an  International Cooperative Administrative Service Support (ICASS) agreement with the State Department. 6.3.4.  Length of Assignment. 6.3.4.1.  Participating USAF and foreign personnel normally will be assigned in the host country for a defined period between 12 to 24 months, on a PCS basis.  SAF/IAPQ will consider assignments for less than 12 months or greater than 24 months on a case-by-case basis.   38  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 6.3.4.2.  Requests for extensions for USAF-hosted foreign nationals will be made through the host organization to SAF/IAPQ with information copies provided to the local Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO). 6.3.4.3.  Requests for extension of USAF ESEP/APEP participants will be made through the host organization back to SAF/IAPQ for coordination by affected USAF offices. 6.3.5.  Limitations.  The  assignment  of  foreign  ESEP/APEP  personnel  will  not  be  used  for training purposes or in combination with Foreign Liaison Officer (FLO) activities in support of  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS).    The  only  training  that  may  be  conducted  under ESEP/APEP is to familiarize, orient, or certify assigned personnel regarding unique aspects of their exchange positions.  The ESEP/APEP will not be used for the purpose of augmenting staff positions or as a means to obtain personnel resources beyond authorized manning levels.  ESEP/APEP personnel may not be used as a conduit for exchanging technical data or other controlled  information  between  the  governments.    ESEP/APEP  participants  will  not  act  as representatives  of  their  government.    Foreign  personnel  may  not  be  assigned  to  a  U.S. contractor facility. 6.3.6.  Applications  for  the  ESEP/APEP.    For  ESEP  and  APEP  applications,  the nominating  command  will  send  the  package  to  MAJCOM  and  SAF/IAPQ  for  staffing  and appropriate action.   The nomination package should consist of the following documentation: 6.3.6.1.  An  application  letter  from  the  individual  desiring  the  assignment  to  his  or  her commander  requesting  consideration  for  the  program.    The  letter  should  have  as attachments the documents listed below: 6.3.6.1.1.  Professional Résumé, including skills and interests. 6.3.6.1.2.  College Transcripts.  Unofficial, legible copies are acceptable. 6.3.6.1.3.  Performance  Reports.    Copies  of  the  last  three  Officer  Performance Reports (OPRs) or Civilian Performance Evaluations. 6.3.6.1.4.  Defense  Language  Aptitude  Battery  (DLAB)  and/or  Defense  Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) results. 6.3.6.1.5.  Medical Certification.  During the application phase, ESEP applicants must submit  a  simple  medical  statement  in  memorandum  format  certifying  suitability  of the entire family for duty overseas.  Selected personnel in the ESEP program will be required  to  submit  an  AF  Form  1466,  Request  for  Family  Member’s  Medical  and Education Clearance for Travel. 6.3.6.1.6.  A summary of career broadening objectives. 6.3.6.1.7.  An  endorsement  letter  signed  at  the  parent  organization’s  two-letter  level stating full support for the application of the candidate.  The endorsement should also acknowledge that the individual will remain on the parent organization Unit Manning Document  (UMD)  for  the  duration  of  the  assignment  (including  language  school,  if applicable)  and  that  the  endorsing  command  will  establish  an  overseas  Operating Location (OL) to support the assignment. 6.3.6.1.8.  An endorsement letter from an Air Force General Officer/Senior Executive Service  in  the  nominee’s  chain  of  command  describing  the  value  the  proposed AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   39  placement will provide.  A statement will be included that outlines why the individual being  placed  is  the  best  candidate  to  help  realize  these  benefits,  as  well  as  a recommendation for a proposed follow-on assignment.  Other pertinent inclusions in the endorsement letter  are a statement on why the placement will provide benefit to the  host  country  and  political/military  considerations  that  need  to  be  addressed  (if any). 6.3.6.1.9.  A letter of application from the candidate.  This will include an explanation of  why  the  proposed  laboratory/organization  was  selected  for  placement.    The explanation  should  include  a  technical  rationale  for  the  proposed  placement  at  the specific  laboratory/organization,  including  a  description  of  the  work  that  is  being performed  at  the  site  and  how  this  work  relates  to  USAF  technical  goals.    If  more than one laboratory/organization is suggested for placement, a ranking of preference should be provided.  The letter should also tell why the applicant wants to participate in the ESEP/APEP program and why he or she would be successful. 6.3.6.1.10.  Additional  Endorsement  Letters.    Candidates  may  provide  additional letters of recommendation if desired. 6.4.  ESEP/APEP  Program  Process.  ESEPs  and  APEPs  are  implemented  through  formal bilateral  MOAs  concluded  pursuant  to  DoDD  5530.3.    Each  MOA  typically  addresses management  arrangements,  personnel  selection  criteria,  financial  and  administrative  matters, intellectual property rights, and security.  ESEP and APEP MOAs are processed using the same manner as outlined in Chapter 2. 6.4.1.  Foreign  ESEP/APEP  Personnel  at  USAF  Facilities.  There  are  two  standard milestones  for  ESEP/APEP  placements  as  stated  in  enabling  MOAs.    Nations  nominating participants are normally expected to do so at least nine months prior to the intended arrival and  receiving  nations  are  expected  to  have  approved  positions  identified  4  months  prior  to arrival.    To  meet  these  timelines,  the  USAF  will  use  the  following  procedures  for  placing foreign exchange personnel at its facilities: 6.4.1.1.  Nomination.  Foreign governments submit their candidate résumés to the EA for placement.  In the cases where the USAF is the EA for an APEP and ESEP agreement, Air  Force  Office  of  Scientific  Research  (AFOSR)  will  handle  the  nomination  package using appropriate procedures found in the following paragraphs.   If another MILDEP or Defense  Agency  has  been  designated  EA,  that  EA  will  send  appropriate  résumés  to AFOSR for ESEP for APEP placement. 6.4.1.2.  ESEP  Placement.    Foreign  candidates  will  be  processed  in  groups,  whenever possible,  to  facilitate  in-  and  out-processing.    When  the  USAF  is  the  EA,  AFOSR  will coordinate  with  other  MILDEPs  to  decide  which  MILDEP  will  attempt  to  place  each foreign candidate based on résumé content.  If necessary, embassy representatives will be asked to clarify candidate qualifications.  In those cases where USAF is the logical choice for  placing  a  candidate,  AFOSR  will  identify  a  prospective  USAF  host  organization; forward  the  résumé  of  the  candidate  to  that  organization  and  include  the  host organization’s relevant MAJCOM/Agency as well as the local FDO; and begin working with  the  MAJCOM/Agency  and  host  organization  to  explore  options  and  draft appropriate  staffing  documents.   The  MAJCOM/Agency  and  prospective  host organization should work closely with their respective FDO.   40  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 6.4.1.3.  Development  of  the  ESEP/APEP  Placement  Package.    The  prospective  host organization,  with  the  assistance  of  AFOSR,  will  develop  the  documents  necessary  to support the placement of the foreign ESEP/APEP candidate at its location.  The following make  up  the  placement  package:    the  PD  (presented  later  to  the  applicable  foreign government  for  approval),  an  Extended  Visit  Authorization  (EVA),  a  DDL,  and  a Security Plan (SP).  Note:  Templates for the PD, EVA, DDL, and SP are located in AFI 16-201. Because the approval level and timing of these documents vary depending on the level of the proposed information release, there are two paths for staffing the placement package: 6.4.1.3.1.  Within  3  weeks  of  receiving  the  résumé  of  a  foreign  ESEP/APEP candidate, the potential host organization will forward a formal letter to  SAF/IAPQ, AFOSR, and courtesy copy their MAJCOM/Agency, indicating interest in placing the foreign  candidate.    This  letter  will  include  a  draft  PD.    Alternatively,  the  potential host  will  decline  formally  within  the  same  time  period  if  the  proposed  candidate cannot be placed at that facility.  This allows time for AFOSR to seek an alternative location for the ESEP/APEP candidate. 6.4.1.3.2.  In  cases  where  the  potential  host  organization  has  agreed  to  place  the individual, AFOSR should receive the full placement package, including a revised PD if  appropriate,  within  4  weeks,  under  signature  of  the  appropriate  commander.  Placement  package  will  be  coordinated the  host  organization’s MAJCOM/Agency. through 6.4.1.4.  Foreign Disclosure.  The disclosure guidance for USAF-hosted APEP and ESEP personnel  is  defined  in  an  approved  Extended  Visit  Authorization  (EVA)  and  in  a Delegation of Disclosure Authority Letter (DDL) (Attachment 2.2), if required.  A Public Domain (Public Release) foreign exchange at a U.S. facility does not require a DDL.  All other  ESEP/APEP  exchanges  at  a  U.S.  facility  require  a  DDL.    EVAs  and  DDLs  for ESEP exchanges that fall under ESEP General Delegation No. 06 covering unclassified, including  Controlled  Unclassified  Information  (CUI))  are  approved  at  the  local  FDO level.    SAF/IAPD  approves  all  DDLs  to  support  ESEP/APEP  positions  that  require access to unclassified and classified information. 6.4.1.4.1.  Foreign  participants  desiring  to  retain  information  and  documents  after completion  of  their  assignment  (regardless  of  type  of  information)  must  make  a request  through  his  or  her  embassy.    Documents  cleared  for  public  release  are  the only exception to this policy. 6.4.1.4.2.  USAF  exchange  personnel  in  foreign  countries  will  have  access  to information as described in the applicable MOA, and, as authorized by the disclosure authority  of  the  host  organization,  on  a  need-to-know  basis.    USAF  exchange personnel may not pass documents or information to a DoD organization or the U.S. Embassy,  or  any  of  its  establishments,  without  prior  written  approval  from  the disclosure authority of the host organization. 6.4.1.5.  Security.    A  Security  Plan  (SP)  is  developed  to  provide  the  supervisor  of  an ESEP/APEP  participant  with  security  information  supporting  exchange  activities  at  the organization  and  work  center  level.    The  author  of  the  SP  must  tailor  it  to  a  specific position  supporting  specific  requirements.    The  SP  will  not  be  shared  with  the  foreign AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   41  national.  It is intended to be a source of information to those working with, supporting, or exposed to the activities of the long-term foreign visitor. 6.4.1.5.1.  AFI  33-200,  Information  Assurance  Management  and  AFMAN  33-282, Computer  Security  (COMPUSEC),  contains  guidance  on  the  approval  process  for allowing foreign ESEP/APEP personnel access to USAF information systems.  Host organization  security  managers  should  work  with  prospective  supervisors  of  foreign exchange personnel to obtain appropriate access prior to the arrival of the exchangee. 6.4.1.5.2.  Procedures Information: for  Positions  Only  Requiring  Access to  Unclassified 6.4.1.5.3.  Upon  receipt  of  the  full  placement  package,  AFOSR  will  transmit  the USAF-approved PD to the foreign embassy for acceptance and copies of the complete nomination package to SAF/IAPQ, SAF/IAPD and the appropriate FDO. 6.4.1.5.4.  Procedures for Positions Requiring Access to Classified Information: 6.4.1.5.5.  When  a  unique  DDL  must  be  drafted  and  approved  for  an  ESEP/APEP exchange, AFOSR will form  an  International  Cooperation Agreement Team  (ICAT) to  assist  the  host  organization  in  developing  all  the  placement  package  documents.  The  ICAT  will  consist  of  representatives  from  SAF/IAPQ,  SAF/IAPD,  relevant SAF/AQ  directorates,  the  host  organization’s  MAJCOM/Agency,  the  appropriate FDO, the prospective supervisor at the host organization, and the supporting security manager.  The documents developed by the  ICAT will be circulated to  all  members for comment.  Once agreement is reached within the ICAT on the best way to proceed and on the text of all documentation, the host organization will forward the completed package  with  a  formal  letter  of  support  to  AFOSR.    The  goal  for  completing  the activity of the ICAT is four weeks, but it will not adjourn until all stakeholders agree on  the  approach  and  associated  documents.    Upon  receipt  of  the  full  placement package,  AFOSR  will  transmit  the  USAF-approved  PD  to  the  foreign  embassy  for acceptance. 6.4.1.6.  Preparation for the Arriving ESEP/APEP Candidate.  The foreign embassy will notify  AFOSR  of  the  acceptance  of  the  position  by  both  the  individual  and  the  foreign parent organization and of the date of arrival.  In turn, AFOSR will pass this information to  the  host  organization,  including  the  appropriate  MAJCOM/Agency,  and  the prospective  supervisor.    Personal  contact  with  the  foreign  ESEP/APEP  participant  is strongly  encouraged  prior  to  arrival  in  the  U.S.    A  sponsor  from  the  host  organization, usually the supervisor, will be assigned to help settle the individual and his or her family.  AFOSR will provide sponsors written guidance as to their responsibilities, best practices, cultural  sensitivities,  etc.    In  addition,  at  least  30  days  prior  to  arrival  the  embassy  will submit a formal visit request through the Foreign Visits System (FVS). 6.4.1.7.  After Arrival of the Foreign ESEP/APEP Participant. 6.4.1.7.1.  Immediately  after  the  exchange  participant  arrives  to  the  host  unit,  the supervisor in the host organization will discuss the program of work contained in the PD with  the foreign participant.    If this dialogue  results in  any proposed  changes to the  PD,  they  will  be  implemented  locally,  if  possible,  reported  to  AFOSR,  and coordinated  with  the  host  organization’s  MAJCOM/Agency.    If  changes  to  the  PD   42  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 require  changes  to  U.S.  information  disclosure  guidelines,  approval  by  the appropriate  FDO  is  required.    If  local  authorities  cannot  reach  agreement  on accommodating the PD changes, the issue will be referred to AFOSR and SAF/IAPQ for resolution. 6.4.1.7.2.  AFOSR  and  the  foreign  embassy  POC  provide  information  sources  for both host organization supervisors and foreign ESEP/APEP participants. 6.4.1.8.  Performance  Evaluations.    The  immediate  USAF  supervisor  of  each  foreign participant is responsible for preparing a performance evaluation of the foreign personnel assigned to  their organization.  Performance  evaluations shall be forwarded through the unit’s  MAJCOM/Agency  to  AFOSR  at  the  completion  of  the  assignment,  or  annually, depending on the length of tour. 6.4.1.9.  Administration  of  Foreign  Personnel  Assignments.    Most  of  the  details  for administering  ESEP/APEP  assignments  are  contained  in  the  governing  MOA.    The following subparagraphs summarize important points to consider: 6.4.1.10.  General.  Treatment of, and privileges accorded to, foreign exchange personnel will comply with applicable U.S. laws and DoD regulations.  Regulations governing the treatment  of  foreign  visits  will  be  consulted  for  specific  information  on  how  the  host installation or activity may grant access to, and use of, facilities and services.  Relevant publications  are  DoDD  5230.20,  DoDI  1000.13,  Identification  (ID)  Cards  for  Members of the Uniformed Services, Their Dependents, and Other Eligible Individuals, and DoDI 1330.21,  Armed  Services  Exchange  Policy  and  DoDI    1330.17,  Armed  Services Commissary Operations.  In general, the foreign civilian exchange personnel will enjoy privileges  similar  to  those  enjoyed  by  USAF  civilian  employees  of  equivalent  grade.  Privileges not available to U.S. citizens as USAF civilian employees will not be granted. 6.4.1.11.  Housing.  The USAF is not responsible for providing housing or other services beyond  those  normally  accorded  to  U.S.  civilians  or  contract  employees.    The  host organization,  however,  will  assist  the  participant  with  local  administrative  matters, settling local transportation, and so forth. the  new  position,  providing into leads  on  housing, identifying 6.4.1.12.  Use of Quarters.  Use of visiting officer quarters may be authorized on a space-available, cost-reimbursement basis, as determined by the base commander. 6.4.1.13.  Use of Medical Facilities.  Emergency use of DoD medical facilities is possible pursuant  to  any  reciprocal  health  agreement  with  the  respective  foreign  government, where applicable.  Typically, the foreign exchange personnel should obtain medical care in the civilian community. 6.4.1.14.  Inventions.    Foreign  exchange  personnel  assigned  to  USAF  facilities  will  be required to execute agreements ensuring that inventions conceived or reduced to practice in  the  performance  of  any  work  done  on  behalf  of  the  U.S.  will  be  made  available  for unlimited U.S.  Government  use under a royalty-free license.   Formats for making these commitments are contained in the specific exchange MOA. 6.4.1.15.  Proprietary  Information.   Foreign participants  will be governed by  at  least  the same limitations imposed on USAF personnel  regarding the use of proprietary data and AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   43  will not disclose such data to any third party or government without the express written permission of the originator or owner of the data. 6.4.2.  USAF  ESEP/APEP  Personnel  at  Foreign  Facilities.  The  two  standard  milestones applicable  for  foreign  ESEP/APEP  placements  in  the  U.S.  also  apply  to  USAF  personnel nominated  for  assignment  overseas.    However,  ESEP/APEP  managers  must  account  for  a minimum  of  six  months  of  language  training  prior  to  arrival  at  the  assignment  location.  SAF/IAPQ  should  notify  foreign  nations  of  the  desire  to  place  ESEP/APEP  individuals  no later than nine months prior to the beginning of language training or, if language training is not required, the intended arrival at the overseas assignment location.  Receiving nations are expected  to  have  approved  the  assignment  4  months  prior  to  the  beginning  of  language training, or arrival in country, as applicable.  SAF/IAPQ notification should include a résumé for  the  nominee  in  the  format  shown  in  the  enabling  MOA,  and  a  statement  regarding  the timing  of  language  training.    To  meet  these  timelines,  SAF/IAPQ  will  use  the  following procedures for placing USAF exchange personnel at foreign facilities: 6.4.2.1.  Eligibility  Requirements. requirements for consideration as exchange candidates:   USAF  personnel  should  meet the  following 6.4.2.1.1.  Possess  skills  for,  and  interest  in,  an  overseas  assignment  that  has  high potential for filling a gap in the USAF knowledge base. 6.4.2.1.2.  Be  a  First  Lieutenant,  Captain,  GS-12,  GS-13,  DRI,  or  DRII.    Higher grades may also be considered, on a case-by-case basis. 6.4.2.1.3.  Be an officer or civil servant with at least four years of experience by the time  they  arrive  in  country.    Civil  servants  must  have  completed  the  probationary period. 6.4.2.1.4.  Applicants should have a master’s degree.  A waiver may be considered for persons without a master’s degree if they have had extensive practical experience.  A request for waiver must be included with the application. 6.4.2.1.5.  Applicants  must  successfully  complete  the  DLAB  test,  or  be  fluent  in listening  and  reading  based  on  the  DLPT  in  the  language  of  the  host  country.  Proficiency based on the DLPT in the host country language may waive the language training requirement. 6.4.2.1.6.  The  Rated  Officer  Assignments  Section,  HQ  Air  Force  Personnel  Center (AFPC), must approve rated military participation.  Approval must be included in the application package. 6.4.2.1.7.  Exceptional  Family  Member  Program  (EFMP).    Exchange  participants have limited access to military medical facilities while overseas.  Applicants and their families must undergo an EFMP evaluation by their local medical facility and family advocacy office.  If approved to participate, AF Form 1466, clearing the applicant and his or her family. 6.4.2.1.8.  The Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) for military members is the Date Eligible for Return from Overseas (DEROS) and one year after PCS to CONUS from  Overseas  in  accordance  with  AFI  36-2107,  Active  Duty  Service  Commitments (ADSC).  Civil servants incur a one-year commitment if they attend language training.   44  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 6.4.2.2.  Selection  of  USAF  ESEP/APEP  Personnel.    SAF/IAPQ  will  staff  ESEP/APEP nomination packages at  the HQ USAF level  and  directly notify the parent  organization, as  well  as  those  selected.    SAF/IAPQ  will  forward  the  ESEP/APEP  résumé  to  the  U.S. Embassy POC.  The process for selection of ESEP/APEP personnel is as follows: 6.4.2.2.1.  SAF/IAPQ  will  convene  and  chair  a  selection  panel.    Generally  the selection  panel  will  consist  of  members  from  SAF/IAPQ,  SAF/IAR,  SAF/IAPD, SAF/AQH, SAF/AQR and AF/A1. 6.4.2.2.2.  The selection panel will approve/disapprove placements based on available funding for that year, as well as the package’s strengths.  The selection panel will also make  decision  on  country  placement  if  more  one  laboratory/organization  was selected. 6.4.2.2.3.  SAF/IAPQ will submit copies of the résumés for selected ESEP/APEPs to the  designated  U.S.  Embassy  POC the  proposed  host  country approximately sixteen months prior to  the projected start  of the overseas  ESEP tour for  cases  where  language  training  is  necessary.    ESEP  selectees  should  be appropriately qualified in the language of the host country prior to arrival. located in 6.4.2.3.  Placement.  U.S. Embassy POCs will work with their host nation counterparts to develop proposed PDs and forward these proposed PDs back to SAF/IAPQ.  SAF/IAPQ will  forward  proposed  PDs  to  applicants  and  supervisors  for  review  and  acceptance.  After  both  sides  agree  on  the  final  placement  location,  there  are  a  number  of  technical tasks that need to be accomplished or accounted for as follows: 6.4.2.3.1.  SAF/IAPQ  will  work  with  the  appropriate  parent  organization  personnel office  to  create  UMD  Personnel  Accounting  Symbol  (PAS)  codes  and  assign exchange participants to the appropriate positions.  The PAS codes and assignments are to be completed and active in the AFPC system at least 8 months prior to the start of the exchange tour. 6.4.2.3.2.  The parent organization personnel office will issue TDY or PCS orders at least  ninety  days  prior  to  departure  to  language  training  school  (approximately  nine months prior to  the start of the ESEP tour).  Orders will cover language  school  and the assignment overseas.  The parent organization’s personnel office will also conduct PCS  out-processing  to  include  obtaining  theater  clearances  and  passports  for  the employee  and  family  members,  as  needed,  arranging  for  necessary  physical examinations,  shipment  and  storage  of  household  goods  and  vehicles,  and  ensuring pay and insurance continuity. 6.4.2.3.3.  SAF/IAPQ  and  AFOSR  will  provide  all  USAF  ESEP/APEP  participants with  background  information  on  the  assignment,  security  requirements,  foreign disclosure policy, the host government, and support arrangements at least ninety days prior to PCS to the host country. 6.4.2.3.4.  Appropriate  USAF  overseas  POCs  (e.g.,  European  Office  of  Aerospace Research  &  Development    (EOARD),  Asian  Office  of  Aerospace  Research  & Development    (AOARD),  Southern  Office  of  Aerospace  Research  &  Development (SOARD),  Offices  of  Defense  Cooperation  (ODC),  Joint  U.S.  Military  Advisory Group  (JUS-MAG),  Air  Attaché,  etc.)  will  provide  assistance  to  the  exchange AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   45  participants  and  their  families  upon  arrival  overseas.    EOARD  has  primary responsibility  for  assisting  ESEP/APEP  participants  stationed  in  Europe  and  the Middle  East.    AOARD  has  primary  responsibility  for  assisting  ESEP/APEP participants  stationed in  Asia and Australia.  SOARD has primary  responsibility for assisting ESEP/APEP participants stationed in South America.  Participants and their families are authorized TDY en route to the supporting base for administrative and in-processing activities before reporting to assignment at the host organization facility. 6.4.2.3.5.  USAF  civilian  personnel,  while  participating  in  the  ESEP/APEP  program in  the  host  country,  will  be  entitled  to  a  station  housing  allowance,  if  applicable.  Civilian personnel  may  be eligible  for available  benefits  normally accorded military personnel,  to  include  use  of  U.S.  commissaries,  U.S.  exchange  facilities,  U.S. Government  medical  facilities,  and  so  forth.    Generally,  USAF  ESEP/APEP personnel will locate their own housing, but may make requests for assistance of the designated support base or host organization. 6.4.2.4.  After  Arrival  at  the  Host  Organization.  The  exchange  participant  should  meet with his or her supervisor as soon as possible after arrival to discuss the assigned PD and ensure that both agree on a complete program of work for the duration of the exchange. 6.4.2.5.  Reports.  During the assignment abroad, USAF participants will submit activity reports to SAF/IAPQ, AFOSR, and their parent organization every six months and at the end  of  the  assignment  (see  Attachment  6.1).    These  reports  will  include  a  summary  of work  performed;  participation  in  conferences,  symposiums,  and  other  meetings;  a description of information and data derived from the exchange; the title and date (and co-authors,  if  applicable)  of  papers  and  reports  prepared;  recommendations  for  follow-on cooperation  (e.g.,  DEAs/IEAs);  and  “lessons  learned”  from  the  overall  assignment  and exchange program. 6.4.2.6.  Return Assignment.   SAF/IAPQ  will coordinate the  return  assignment with  the parent  organization  of  a  civilian  participant.    Civilian  participants  return  to  their  parent organization after completing their assignment.  Returning military participants will work directly with AFPC to identify a return assignment.  They may or may not return to their parent  organization  after  completing  their  assignment,  depending  upon  needs  of  the USAF.  AFPC will update the personnel records of returning ESEP/APEP participants to indicate successful completion of an international assignment. 6.5.  HQ USAF and Proponent Responsibilities. 6.5.1.  SAF/IAPQ will: 6.5.1.1.  Act as the EA for all ESEP and APEP personnel. 6.5.1.2.

The  ICR&D  Program  promotes  IAC  activities  with  North Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  member  states,  NATO  organizations,  major  non-NATO allies,  and  Friendly  Foreign  Countries  (FFCs)  by  providing  RDT&E  funding  to  selected technology  development  and  demonstration/validation  projects  that  improve  commonality, standardization, and interoperability. 7.2.  Background.  Initially,  the  ICR&D  Program  was  developed  and  funded  to  improve  what Congress  perceived  as  inadequate  cooperation  between  the  U.S.  and  NATO  nations  in  R&D.  The  program  has  since  been  expanded  by  Congress  to  include  international  participation  by NATO,  individual  NATO  member  states,  NATO  organizations,  major  non-NATO  allies,  and FFCs.  First  enacted in  the National  Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year (FY) 1986, the legal  authority  behind  the  ICR&D  Program  was  later  codified  in  Title  10  U.S.C.  §  2350a  by Public Law 101-189, the National Defense Authorization Act for FYs 1990/1991. 7.2.1.  The  ICR&D Program  uses RDT&E  funds and, within certain  limitations common to this appropriation, the funds are available for obligation during two fiscal years.  While many other  sources  of  funds  are  used  to  pursue  R&D  efforts,  this  program  provides  funding  to capitalize  on  cooperative  opportunities.    ICR&D  programs  must  also  satisfy  the  following requirements prior to the expenditure of any funds: 7.2.2.1.  The  SECDEF  (delegated  to  USD(AT&L))  must  determine  that  the  project  will improve  conventional  defense  capabilities the  application  of  emerging technology. through 7.2.2.2.  Projects must be conducted pursuant to a formal IA as described in Chapter 2. 7.2.2.3.  ICR&D funds cannot be used to procure equipment or services from any foreign entity. 7.2.2.4.  The  foreign  participant  must  provide  an  equitable  share  of  the  project  costs.  These project  contributions  cannot  include  any  U.S.  military or economic  grants,  loans, or other forms of assistance. 7.3.  ICR&D Program Process. 7.3.1.  Guidelines  for  Allocating  and  Managing  ICR&D  Program  Funds.  Selection  of projects to  receive  ICR&D Program  funding is  constrained by the forecasted availability of funds.  Funds cannot exceed a combined two-year total of $1 million for any specific project.  Projects outside the typical amounts/time may be considered with strong justification. 7.3.1.1.  ICR&D Program funding is considered matching funding.  The USAF proponent project office must commit funds (not including any non-financial contributions) from its own USAF RDT&E Program Elements (PEs) that are equal, or greater than, the amount of  funding  being  requested  from  the  ICR&D  Program.    The  requirement  to  provide USAF funding in at least the same amount as the ICR&D Program matching funding is   48  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 for  the  total  project,  not  necessarily  within  each  FY.    However,  projects  cannot  be supported exclusively by ICR&D Program funds in any single FY. 7.3.1.2.  The  commitment  of  the  USAF  funding  must  be  coordinated  with  the  Program Element Monitor (PEM) for each PE.  Joint projects entailing participation by other DoD agencies and MILDEPs must also be coordinated with the organization involved and the MILDEP international program office. 7.3.1.3.  Current year funding for ICR&D projects may be used for projects programmed for future  year ICR&D funding.  For example, in order to fully obligate FY 12 ICR&D funding,  a  project  originally  scheduled  to  receive  FY  14/15  funds  could  instead  be awarded FY 12 funds. 7.3.2.  Processes for Allocating and Managing ICR&D Program Funds. 7.3.2.1.  Nomination  and Review Process.    Identification of potential projects  to  receive ICR&D  Program  funding  begins  with  the  SAF/IA  call  for  proposals  to  appropriate  HQ USAF  offices  and  MAJCOMs  issued  in  January  or  February  of  each  year.    Project managers complete and submit project nomination forms to SAF/IAPQ by April.  Note:  The project nomination form does not replace the SSOI, rather it serves only to identify and evaluate candidate  ICR&D projects  for funding.  Project  offices will be required to prepare documentation to support development and negotiation of an IA (see Chapter 2) for any project receiving ICR&D funding.  The draft form for use in nominating ICR&D project can be found at Attachment 7.  Proponents should consult with SAF/IAPQ for the latest  version of the nomination  form.   Candidate project  nomination forms  received by the  August  due  date  each  year  undergo  a  review  by  an  HQ  USAF  Review  Panel convened by SAF/IAPQ.  This panel meets to evaluate, select, and rank proposed projects eligible for ICR&D Program funding. 7.3.2.2.  General  criteria  considered  by  this  panel  includes  the  extent  to  which  the proposed  cooperative  project:    (1)  delivers  significant  improvements  in  conventional capabilities to the USAF through the application of emerging technologies or processes; (2) directly addresses a documented USAF requirement; (3) benefits the U.S. more than would  a  U.S.-only  effort,  and  the  benefits  outweigh  the  technology  transfer  or  program risks  inherent  in  the  cooperative  project;    (4)  delivers  products  to  the  acquisition community  for  incorporation  in  systems;  and  (5)  supports  the  Air  Force  Global Partnership Strategy.  Specific criteria to be considered by the panel are described in the nomination form attached to the annual proposal call letter. 7.3.2.3.  SAF/IAPQ  will  call  on  selected  HQ  USAF  and  other  offices  to  identify participants for the Review Panel.  Note:  Other Review Panel participants may include SAF/IAPD, SAF/IAPS, SAF/IAR(s) Divisions, the SAF/IA Programming and Resources Division (SAF/IAGR),  the Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Air Force for Acquisition, Science,  Technology,  and  Engineering  (SAF/AQR),  and  Acquisition,  Special  Programs (SAF/AQL).  SAF/IAPQ will provide all project nomination forms to each member of the Review Panel for evaluation.  On behalf of the panel members, SAF/IAPQ will issue any necessary requests for clarification.  Typically, the panel process is completed within two weeks.  During this period, project offices submitting nominations are expected to ensure their  POC  is  available  to  answer  questions  about  the  proposed  project.    Project proponents  may  be  asked  to  appear  before  the  panel.    Candidate  projects  prioritized AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   49  below the threshold of forecasted available funding will be considered for future funding in the event additional funds become available, or if the IAs for the more highly ranked projects are not signed. 7.3.2.4.  In  June,  SAF/IAPQ  will  publish  the  Review  Panel  results,  identifying  those projects  selected  for  ICR&D  Program  funding,  their  relative  rank,  and  the  funding amounts to be allocated to each project by FY. 7.3.3.  Release of ICR&D Program Funds.  ICR&D Program funds allocated to a particular cooperative project will not be released until the supporting IA has been signed.  Following signature,  SAF/IAPQ  will  distribute  ICR&D  Program  funds  to  the  project  financial management team. 7.3.3.1.  At  the  beginning  of  each  FY,  SAF/IAPQ  will  send  the  appropriate  financial management  office(s)  an  allocation  letter  identifying  funding  anticipated  for  both continuing and new projects for that year.  Following the signature of the annual National Defense  Appropriation  Act  and  receipt  of  the  subsequent  budget  authority,  SAF/IAPQ will distribute ICR&D Program funds. 7.4.  Reporting  Requirements.  Reporting  requirements  are  necessary to  accommodate management  of  the  ICR&D  Program  and  to  ensure  the  continued  viability  of  the  ICR&D Program funds. 7.4.1.  Quarterly  Reports.  For the period of the cooperative project,  USAF project offices executing  ongoing  IAC  projects  using  ICR&D  Program  funds  must  prepare  and  submit quarterly  reports  to  SAF/IAPQ  according  to  the  guidance  provided  by  SAF/IAPQ  to  the project offices.  The format and specific contents of the quarterly report will be provided by SAF/IAPQ to the project offices. 7.4.2.  Monthly Financial Reports.  For the period of the cooperative project, USAF project offices  executing  ongoing  IAC  projects  using  ICR&D  Program  funds  must  prepare  and submit  monthly  summary  financial  reports  to  SAF/IAPQ.    The  format  and  content  of  the reports can be found in Attachment 7.2.  Although project offices are not required to submit monthly financial reports until they have received actual funds, they are strongly encouraged to  begin  coordinating  with  financial  POCs  to  ensure  that  funds  can  be  obligated  and expended in an efficient manner. 7.4.3.  Project Final Reports.  Project offices executing ongoing IAC projects using ICR&D Program funds or using the legal authority provided by Title 10 U.S.C. § 2350a must submit three copies of each final report generated to SAF/IAPQ upon the conclusion of the project. 7.5.  HQ USAF and Proponent Responsibilities. 7.5.1.  SAF/IAPQ will: 7.5.1.1.  Plan, program, and budget for the ICR&D Program. 7.5.1.2.  Conduct  an  annual  call  for  project  nominations  seeking  ICR&D  Program funding. 7.5.1.3.  Convene an HQ USAF Review Panel to evaluate nominated projects, determine which  are  candidates  for  ICR&D  Program  funding,  and  rank  the  candidates  in  order  of merit.   50  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 7.5.1.4.  Provide the HQ USAF Review Panel results to USAF proponent project offices identifying those projects selected for ICR&D Program funding, their relative rank, and the funding amounts to be allocated to each project by FY. 7.5.1.5.  Following signature of the IA for a project identified to receive ICR&D Program funds, release the allocated funds. 7.5.2.  Proponents will: 7.5.2.1.  Seek opportunities for ICR&D Program cooperation with partner nations. 7.5.2.2.  Prepare ICR&D Program documentation in response to the annual USAF call for project nominations. 7.5.2.3.        Form  ICATs  for  approved  projects  immediately  upon  notification  of  project approval and provide SAF/IAPQ draft agreement staffing packages within three months. 7.5.2.4.  Execute approved ICR&D Programs in accordance with existing IAs. 7.5.2.5.  Submit final reports as described in this Chapter, Chapter 2, & Attachment 7. 7.5.3.  GCQ will: 7.5.3.1.  Review  proposed  ICR&D  Programs  to  ensure  consistency  with  U.S.  law, regulations, and policies. AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   51  Chapter 8 THE COALITION WARFARE PROGRAM (CWP) 8.1.  Purpose and Objectives. 8.1.1.  The CWP is a defense-wide effort to assist the COCOMs, MILDEPs, and Department DoD organizations in integrating coalition-enabling solutions into existing and planned U.S. programs.  The program focuses not only on short-term, interoperability-enhancing solutions, but  also  on  early  identification  of  coalition  solutions  to  long-term  interoperability  issues (architectures,  coalition  requirements,  major  system  acquisition)  with  a  broad  range  of potential coalition partners. 8.1.2.  The  CWP  takes  a  multidimensional  approach  to  fostering  interoperability  between U.S.  forces  and  coalition  partners  worldwide  through  IAC  projects.    First,  the  program promotes the development of solutions that support the near-term needs of warfighters across the  regional  COCOMs.    Second,  the  CWP  solicits  projects  that  address  critical  capabilities anywhere  across  the  spectrum  of  conflict,  from  humanitarian  assistance  and  peacekeeping contingencies  to  high-intensity  conflict.    Finally,  while  the  CWP  emphasizes  materiel  and technological solutions, initiatives enabling interoperable transformation will be considered. 8.2.  Background.  Congress  first  authorized  and  appropriated  funds  for  CWP  in  FY  2001.  Since  that  time,  OUSD(AT&L)/IC  has  planned,  programmed,  and  budgeted  for  CWP  seed money  and  provided  guidance  on  the  processes  and  rules  of  the  CWP.    Additionally,  CWP supports  international  cooperative  projects  which  foster  coalition  warfare  pursuant  to  Titles  10 and 22 of the United States Code. USAF proponents for potential CWP projects should consult with SAF/IAPQ as soon as they have determined interest in a project submission and refer to the OUSD(AT&L)/IC  CWP  website  (http://www.acq.osd.mil/ic/cwp.html)  for  guidance  on  the annual process, key documents, and templates of nomination forms, reports, etc. 8.3.  CWP Process. 8.3.1.  Selection of CWP Projects. 8.3.1.1.  Nomination Process.  Identification of potential USAF projects to receive CWP funding begins with a SAF/IA memorandum  call for proposals to the MAJCOMs.  This call memorandum is issued in the spring of each year.  Several months are provided for proponents to complete and submit project Executive Summaries to SAF/IAPQ. 8.3.1.2.  Proponents seeking CWP funding for a project must first complete the Executive Summary,  and  then  a  more  detailed  Project  Nomination  Form,  to  receive  full consideration by the OSD CWP review board.  Templates for these documents are at the OSD CWP website. Proponents must coordinate with the relevant FDO when drafting the initial  proposal.  Proponents  should  consider  the  following  criteria  in  developing  their proposal: 8.3.1.2.1.  Strong project management.  CWP only accepts project nominations from DoD organizations.  CWP Project Teams must properly  execute, manage, and report on the selected CWP projects, mitigating risks and seizing opportunities as they arise.  Successful  projects  have  achievable  goals,  reasonable  funding  requests,  and executable transition plans.   52  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 8.3.1.2.2.  Sound  foreign  partnership.    CWP  projects  are  collaborative  efforts  with foreign  partners'  defense  organizations.    The  foreign  partner(s)  must  have  a demonstrable  engagement  in  the  RDT&E  work,  to  include  committing  resources  to the  effort.    The  legal  vehicles  (e.g.,  required  international  agreements,  licenses, security, etc.) and other requirements (e.g., foreign disclosure approvals, etc.) must be achievable. 8.3.1.2.3.  Substantive  RDT&E  content.    CWP,  as  an  RDT&E  program  element, mandates that funding be used to execute research, development, test and evaluation projects.  CWP projects must conform to the rules for RDT&E funding.  Projects can include development across the RDT&E spectrum. 8.3.1.2.4.  Warfighter  emphasis.    CWP  selects  projects  that  have  the  support  of  the COCOMs and that provide them the capabilities and coalition enablers they require to be successful in their missions and operations.  Projects may support the full-range of DoD operations. 8.3.1.2.5.  Sound  resource  planning.    CWP  funding  should  be  requested  for  U.S. activities within a project.  Selected projects will receive one to two years of funding-up  to  a  maximum  of  $1  million  per  year,  which  should  be  expended  within  three years.    The  request  for  CWP  funding  should  be  a  fraction  of  the  cost  of  the  whole project  and  should  be  matched  or  exceeded  by  other  U.S.  resources.    An organization's commitment to a project is weighed by the financial contributions that are  directly  applied  to  the  RDT&E  effort  in  the  project.    Projects  should  also  show equitable cost sharing between the total U.S. (CWP and other U.S. contributions) and the  foreign  partners.    Projects  requesting  the  maximum  CWP  funding  must demonstrate responsiveness to critical DoD needs. 8.3.1.2.6.  Tangible outcomes.  CWP projects result in tangible deliverables.  Highly attractive  projects  develop  and  demonstrate  solutions  that  reach  warfighters  within two to three years. 8.3.1.2.7.  Transition  plan.    Transitioning  a  CWP  project  involves  maturing  the technology  to  the  next  phase  of  development,  testing,  or  final  fielding.  CWP nominations  must  have  an  identified  transition  plan  with  written  support  from  a transition  manager  showing  commitment  to  the  effort  after  the  CWP  project  is completed. 8.3.1.3.  HQ USAF Recommendation Process.  USAF CWP project nominations undergo a review by an HQ USAF Review Panel convened by SAF/IAPQ.  This panel serves to identify and rank proposed projects eligible for CWP funding for the purpose of making a USAF recommendation to OUSD(AT&L)/IC. 8.3.1.4.  The OSD Selection Process.  OUSD(AT&L)/IC will convene a review board to review  the  top  nominations.    The  feedback  from  this  review  board  will  be  used  in  the project  selection  process.    The  Director,  OUSD(AT&L)/IC  makes  the  final  selection  of projects for CWP funding.  Selection is contingent upon the availability of funds and the degree  project  nominations  address  the  criteria  listed  above  and  current  prioritized coalition deficiencies.  At the discretion of the board, offices submitting projects may be given an opportunity to clarify proposals. AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   53  8.3.2.  International  Agreements  (IA).    Generally,  CWP  projects  require  an  IA  to  be negotiated  and  signed  to  facilitate  the  project  (see  Chapter  2).    CWP  project  proponents should  keep  this  in  mind  when  developing  their  goals  and  schedules.    OSD  provides  the funds directly to the project office. 8.3.3.  CWP  Reporting  Requirements.  Offices executing projects using CWP funds must prepare and submit monthly financial reports and Quarterly Program Reports (QPRs) to OSD with  information  copies  to  SAF/IAPQ.    The  OSD  CWP  website  details  the  content  and timelines for submission. 8.4.  HQ USAF and Proponent Responsibilities. 8.4.1.  SAF/IAPQ will: 8.4.1.1.  Assist USAF proponents with developing project nomination documentation. 8.4.1.2.  Convene an HQ USAF Review Panel to evaluate nominated projects. 8.4.1.3.  Forward approved USAF nomination packages to OSD. 8.4.1.4.  Participate in OSD/CTO Review Panel for all proposals. 8.4.1.5.  Coordinate  proposed  CWP  packages  with  appropriate  SAF/AQ  directorates having the same or similar systems/technologies. 8.4.2.  Proponents will: 8.4.2.1.  Draft  appropriate  documentation  when  nominating  a  project  for  CWP  funding, consult  with  SAF/IAPQ  and  their  local  FDO  during  the  process,  and  execute  the approved project within the cost, schedule and performance parameters in the proposal. 8.4.2.2.  Promptly  submit  periodic  and  final  CWP  reports  to  OSD  with  information copies to SAF/IAPQ.   54  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 Chapter 9 INTERNATIONAL OTHER TRANSACTIONS (OTS) AND NON-DOMESTIC COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS (CRADAS) 9.1.  Purpose and Objectives.  An International OT is available for SECDEF and the MILDEPs to  use  with  foreign  non-government  entities,  primarily  industries  and  universities,  and  may  be considered along with contracts and IAs during the development of an acquisition strategy.  OTs are  transactions  other  than  contracts,  grants,  or  cooperative  agreements,  and  are  used  to accomplish  various  objectives.    Non-domestic  CRADAs  enable  the  USAF  to  benefit  from science and technology developed abroad. 9.2.  Background.  OTs  are  not  subject  to  statutes  and  regulations  that  apply  specifically  to contracts,  grants, and cooperative agreements (e.g., the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)).  Generally,  there  are  two  types  of  OTs:    OTs  for  research  and  OTs  for  acquisition  of  weapon system prototypes.  Particular policy guidance applies to each type of OT. 9.2.1.  OTs  for  Research.  OTs for research, authorized by Title 10 U.S.C. § 2371, support basic,  applied,  and  advanced  research.    They  can  only  be  used  when  a  standard  contract, grant, or cooperative agreement is not feasible or appropriate.  Cost must be shared and the U.S. cannot contribute a value greater than its partner.  A determination justifying the use of an OT for research is required. 9.2.2.  OTs for Acquisition of Weapon System Prototypes.  OTs authorized by Section 845 of  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  FY  1994,  PL  103-160,  as  amended,  may  be used  for  acquisition  of  prototype  projects  relevant  to  weapon  systems  proposed  to  be acquired or developed by  DoD.   A “prototype” is an  end-product  that  reasonably  evaluates the  technical  feasibility  or  operational  military  utility  of  a  concept  or  system.    The  use  of Section 845 authority eliminates the applicability of some, but not all laws and regulations; and  provides  a  flexible,  relatively  unstructured  environment  for  the  prototype  project.    For example,  commercial  practices  rather  than  government-unique  requirements  may  be  used.  Accordingly,  traditional  defense  contractors  are  permitted  to  consider  new  ways  of  doing business  and  strictly  commercial  firms  are  permitted  to  do  business  with  the  DoD  without changing their existing business practices.  Unlike OTs for research described above, Section 845 OTs do not require cost sharing or a determination justifying their use but must employ competitive  procedures  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable.    Over  the  years,  Congress  has added various amendments to the original legislation that require notifications and approvals   Proponents  should  consult  the  “Other in  certain  circumstances  by  USD(AT&L). Transactions”  Guide  for  Prototype  Projects  published  by  OUSD(AT&L)/DPAP  and SAF/IAPQ for current requirements. 9.2.3.  Non-domestic  CRADAs.  CRADAs  are  authorized  by  15  U.S.C.  §  3710a  and explained  in  AFI  61-302,  Cooperative  Research  and  Development  Agreements  and  the  Air Force  Technology  Transfer  Handbook.    They  can  only  be  used  when  a  standard  contract, grant, or cooperative agreement is not feasible or appropriate.  Only non-government foreign entities qualify for CRADA partnerships with USAF organizations according to 15 U.S.C. § 3710a.  Specific guidance on non-domestic CRADAs is contained in Executive Order 12591, Section  4.    The  considerations  and  staffing  procedures  described  below  only  apply  when  a AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   55  proponent  contemplates  concluding  a  non-domestic  CRADA  directly  with  a  foreign  entity. CRADAs  are  instruments  qualitatively  different  from  contracts,  grants,  and  cooperative agreements  that  allow  U.S.  laboratory  personnel  to  perform  R&D  in  collaboration  with foreign industrial or other non-government entities, such as universities, without the transfer of  U.S.  funds.    The  definition  of  foreign  is  as  in  Title  22,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations,  § 120.16, International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), current edition. 9.2.4.  Policy  Considerations.  When  considering  a  non-domestic  CRADA,  USAF proponents  should  give  appropriate  consideration  to  the  following  in  accordance  with  EO 12591, Section 4(a): 9.2.4.1.  Whether  such  foreign  companies  or  governments  permit  and  encourage  U.S. agencies, organizations, or persons to enter into CRADAs and licensing arrangements on a comparable basis; 9.2.4.2.  Whether  those  foreign  governments  have  policies  to  protect  U.S.  intellectual property rights (IPR); and 9.2.4.3.  Where cooperative research will involve data, technologies, or products subject to  national  security  export  controls  under  the  laws  of  the  U.S.,  whether  those  foreign governments  have  adopted  adequate  measures  to  prevent  the  transfer  of  strategic technology to destinations prohibited under such national security export controls, either through participation in the Coordinating Committee for Multinational Export Controls or through other IAs to which the U.S. and such foreign governments are signatories. 9.3.  Documentation Requirements. 9.3.1.  OT  Documentation.  Prior  to  entering  into  negotiations  with  a  foreign  non-government entity, the proponent submits a Summary Sheet (Attachment 8) for the proposed International OT to SAF/IAPQ. 9.3.2.  CRADA  Documentation.  The  proponent  must  determine the cooperating  organization.    Only  non-government  foreign  entities  qualify  for  non-domestic CRADA  partnerships  with  USAF  organizations.    Prior  to  negotiating  a  CRADA  with  a foreign  partner,  the  proponent  submits  the  following  documentation  for  the  proposed  non-domestic CRADA to SAF/IAPQ: the  status  of 9.3.2.1.  A memorandum from the office of the proponent in support of the non-domestic CRADA at the two-letter level. 9.3.2.2.  The non-domestic CRADA Summary Sheet (Attachment 8). 9.3.2.3.  A memorandum or email  from  the United States Trade Representative (USTR) stating  there  are  no  issues  with  developing  the  non-domestic  CRADA.    The  proponent should consult with SAF/IAPQ for current procedures and POCs at the USTR office. 9.3.2.4.  A statement signed by the local FDO identifying the work under a non-domestic CRADA as either public domain or export controlled. 9.4.  Process. 9.4.1.   Process for OTs.   56  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 9.4.1.1.  Upon  receiving  a  proposed  Summary  Sheet,  SAF/IAPQ  conducts  HQ  USAF staffing,  responds  to  staff  comments  as  appropriate,  then  sends  a  memorandum  to  the proponent  authorizing  negotiations.    HQ  USAF  staffing  includes,  at  a  minimum, SAF/AQ, SAF/GCQ, SAF/IAPD, and the appropriate offices within SAF/IAR. 9.4.1.2.  After  receiving  approval  from  SAF/IAPQ,  the  proponent  negotiates  and  signs the International OT. 9.4.1.3.  The proponent sends a copy of the signed International OT to SAF/IAPQ within twenty    days  of  its  conclusion  or  notifies  SAF/IAPQ  that  a  proposed  International  OT will not be concluded. 9.4.2.  Process for Non-domestic CRADA. 9.4.2.1.  Upon  receiving  a  non-domestic  CRADA  package,  SAF/IAPQ  conducts  HQ USAF staffing, responds to staff comments as appropriate, then sends a memorandum to the  proponent  authorizing  negotiations.    HQ  USAF  staffing  includes,  at  a  minimum, SAF/AQ, SAF/GCQ, SAF/IAPD, and the appropriate SAF/IAR regional division. 9.4.2.2.  After  receiving  approval  from  SAF/IAPQ,  the  proponent  negotiates  and  signs the non-domestic CRADA. 9.4.2.3.  The proponent sends a copy of the signed non-domestic CRADA to SAF/IAPQ within twenty days of its conclusion or notifies SAF/IAPQ that a proposed non-domestic CRADA will not be concluded. 9.5.  Responsibilities. 9.5.1.  HQ USAF and Proponent Responsibilities for OTs. 9.5.1.1.  SAF/IAPQ will: 9.5.1.1.1.  Assist proponents as they develop International OT Summary Sheets. 9.5.1.1.2.  Review, staff, and authorize negotiations for International OTs. 9.5.1.1.3.  Act  as  the  USAF  focal  point  with  OUSD(AT&L)/DPAP  on  International OTs. 9.5.1.2.  SAF/IAPD will: 9.5.1.2.1.

Purpose and Objectives.  This Chapter describes requirements and procedures for USAF participation  in  multilateral  IAC  forums  associated  with  the  NATO  Conference  of  National Armaments Directors (CNAD) and discusses other forums that support International Armaments Cooperation (IAC) objectives. 10.2.  The  CNAD  and  Subordinate  Groups.  The  CNAD  is  composed  of  the  senior  person responsible for defense procurement of each NATO nation.  The U.S. CNAD Principal, referred to  as  the  U.S.  National  Armaments  Director  (NAD),  is  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)).  The CNAD advises the North Atlantic Council  (NAC)  and  acts  under  NAC  authority  on  matters  pertaining  to  the  development  and procurement of equipment for NATO forces.  The CNAD meets twice a year.  When the CNAD is not in session, members of the national delegations to NATO meet as the National Armaments Directors  Representatives  (NADREPs)  to  address  routine  matters.    DoDI  2010.4,  U.S. Participation  in  Certain  NATO  Groups  Relating  to  Research,  Development,  Production,  and Logistic Support of Military Equipment, contains additional information. 10.2.1.  Subordinate  Groups.  The  CNAD  has  a  subordinate  group  structure  to  support  its activities.    NATO  identifies  each  CNAD  group  with  an  Atlantic  Council  (AC)  number.  There  are  three  Main  Armament  Groups  (MAGs)  reporting  to  the  CNAD:    the  NATO  Air Force Armaments Group (NAFAG) (AC/224), the NATO Army Armaments Group (NAAG) (AC/225), and the NATO Naval Armaments Group (NNAG) (AC/141).  The NATO Science and  Technology  Organization  (STO)  (AC/323)  reports  both  to  the  CNAD  and  NATO Military Committee.  Each of these groups establishes subgroups, as required.  These groups provide  a  forum  for  exchanging  information,  exploring  IAC  opportunities,  standardizing military  hardware  and  software,  and  developing  standardization  agreements  among  NATO nations.    The  CNAD  occasionally  forms  ad  hoc  groups  or  project  steering  committees  to address special issues or individual IAC projects. 10.2.1.1.  NAFAG.    The  primary  CNAD-subordinate  group  in  which  the  USAF participates is the NAFAG.  The U.S. NAFAG Principal is appointed by SAF/AQ.  The NAFAG  mission  is  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  NATO  air  forces  by  promoting cooperation,  standardization,  and  interoperability  in  the  area  of  aerospace  armaments through  joint  activities,  information  exchange,  and  materiel  standardization  agreements.  The  USAF  participates  in  other  CNAD  groups  as  well  as  panels  under  the  NATO Standardization  Agency  (NSA)  to  support  the  goals  of  IAC  programs  or  as  tasked  by OSD. 10.2.1.1.1.  The  NAFAG  has  a  subordinate  group  structure  to  support  its  activities.  This  structure  includes  the  NAFAG  Board  of  Advisors  (BoA),  three  Aerospace Capability  Groups  (ACGs)  and  two  Joint  Capability  Groups  (JCGs):    (1)  ACG  2—Effective Engagement, (2) ACG 3—Survivability, (3) ACG 5—Global Mobility, (4) JCG  ISR—Intelligence,  Surveillance,  and  Reconnaissance,  ,  and  (5)  JCG  C2—Command and Control.  ACGs may occasionally form subgroups to address specific   60  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 requirements.    The  USAF  provides  the  majority  of  U.S.  representation  in  these groups. 10.2.1.1.2.  The  other  MAGs  have  a  subordinate  group  structure  to  support  their activities.  Each MAG has a JCG administratively assigned to it.  All of the capability groups  are  subject  to  joint  participation  according  to  their  programs  of  work.    As applicable, the USAF provides participation in these groups. 10.2.1.1.3.  Procedural  Guidance.    USAF  personnel  attending  meetings  of  the NAFAG and its subordinate groups will use the following paragraphs to  guide their participation: 10.2.1.1.3.1.  Each  delegation  to  a  NATO  activity  will  designate  a  member  as Head  of  Delegation  (HOD)  to  be  the  principal  representative.    The  HOD  is accountable  for  due  diligence  before,  during,  and  after  meetings  to  include complying  with  the  guidance  in  this  AFMAN,  in  other  pertinent  directives,  and from the U.S. Mission to NATO.  The HOD represents the U.S.  and its national positions.    Other  members  of  the  delegation  also  represent  the  U.S.  and  support the HOD. 10.2.1.1.3.2.  USAF delegates tasked with preparing or updating presentations and statements  for  a  CNAD-subordinate  group  meeting  will  allow  ample  time  for policy and foreign disclosure coordination. 10.2.1.1.3.3.  USAF delegates will initiate requests for disclosure authorization as soon as possible (usually six to eight weeks) before a meeting date.  A copy of the proposed  presentation  or  statement,  including  viewgraphs,  must  be  submitted  to the appropriate FDO office. 10.2.1.1.3.4.  When  situations  develop  at  meetings  that  are  not  covered  by  a coordinated  U.S.  position, the U.S.  representative will determine whether a U.S. position on the issue can be derived or determined from available information and guidance.    If  a  U.S.  position  cannot  be  determined  at  the  moment,  the  U.S. representative  will  state  that  he/she  will  seek  clarification  and  provide  a  U.S. position as soon as possible. 10.2.1.1.3.5.  Informal  discussions  “on  the  margins”  of  a  CNAD-subordinate group meeting (e.g., during meeting breaks) can often resolve differences among governments  more  easily  than  formal  deliberations.    USAF  participants  will follow the same U.S. policy and disclosure guidelines in such discussions as they would in formal deliberations. 10.2.1.1.3.6.  USAF  participants  will (prepared  or extemporaneous)  by  the  Chairman,  Secretary,  National  Delegates,  and  other representatives at a CNAD-subordinate group meeting as if they were to be placed on  the  written  record  (referred  to  as  a  “Decision  Sheet”  or  “Summary  Record”) prepared  by  the  Secretary,  except  in  situations  when  a  delegate  requests  the Chairman to permit off-the-record remarks. treat  all  comments 10.2.1.1.3.7.  Follow-Up.    The  USAF  delegate  at  a  CNAD-subordinate  group meeting will ensure actions agreed to by the U.S. are completed and will report to AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   61  higher authority any difficulties with completion of actions. 10.2.1.1.3.8.  All  official  written  U.S.  policy  communications  with  the  NATO International  Staff  and  with  the  CNAD-subordinate  group  delegates  from  other governments are conducted through the U.S. Mission to NATO. 10.2.1.1.3.9.  USAF  delegates  will  follow  the  responsibilities  and  procedures  for developing,  ratifying,  and  implementing  NATO  standardization  agreements contained  in  AFI  60-106,  The  United  States  Air  Force  International  Military Standardization Program, and AFI 60-101, Materiel Standardization. 10.2.1.2.  NATO  STO.    Formerly  known  as  the  RTA,  the  Collaboration  Support  Office (CSO)  supports  the  Science  and  Technology  Organization  (STO).    The  STO  promotes Science and Technology (S&T) among the collective needs of NATO, NATO members, and NATO partner nations.  The STO is operated under the authority of the NAC which has delegated the operations of the STO to the S&T Board (STB) comprising the NATO Nations  S&T  managers.  The  STB  is  chaired  by  the  NATO  Chief  Scientist  who  is permanently  assigned  to  NATO  headquarters  and  also  serves  as  the  senior  scientific advisor to NATO leadership.  More information can be found at http://www.sto.nato.int. 10.2.1.2.1.  Technical panels, groups, and committees formed within the STO address a  wide  spectrum  of  scientific  research  activities.    USD(AT&L)  calls  on  USAF scientists  to  be  members  and  occasionally  act  as  chairpersons  on  behalf  of  all participating  nations  in  these  forums.    USAF  personnel  are  approved  by  SAF/AQR and  then  assigned  to  these  positions  by  USD(AT&L)  in  a  formal  written  letter.  Funding  to  support  USAF  participants  comes  from  the  command  to  which  the participant belongs. 10.3.  USAF Responsibilities under the CNAD, the NAFAG,  and the STO. 10.3.1.

Trip  reports  from  all  NAFAG-related  travel  must  be  submitted  to  SAF/IAPQ within thirty days or returning. 10.4.  Other IAC Forums.  The USAF meets with partner nations in a wide variety of forums to help meet the overall goals and objectives of IAC.  Some of the meetings are highly structured while  others  are  more  informal,  but  the  intention  is  always  to  discuss  topics  that  can  lead  to stronger partnerships, more effective coalition operations, and better equipment and materiel for the  warfighter.    SAF/IAPQ  works  to  develop  agendas  that  support  the  USAF  objective  of building  partnerships  and  increasing  partnership  capability  and  interoperability.    If  a  USAF proponent has an item or issue to present at one of these forums that supports these objectives, that  proponent  should  contact  SAF/IAPQ  for  procedures  to  make  a  submission  to  the  U.S. organizer of that forum for inclusion of an agenda topic. 10.4.1.  SAF/IA-Led  IAC  Forums.  SAF/IA  is  co-chair  to  a  number  of  forums  to  promote IAC,  and  develops  new  forums  to  address  specific  or  emerging  mission  critical  needs  as necessary.  A sample of these forums are referenced below, but should not be construed as a reflection of the full scope of forums SAF/IA manages over the course of a year.  A current list of SAF/IA led forums can be attained by contacting SAF/IAPQ. 10.4.1.1.  Australia.  The Air Senior National Representative (ASNR) forum is an annual meeting  co-chaired  by  the  Australian  Deputy  Chief  of  Air  Force  and  the  Assistant SAF/IA.    The  forum  deals  with  air,  space,  and  cyberspace  interoperability  and cooperation  and  includes  discussions  on  strategic  planning,  operational  planning, capability  development,  combat  support,  and  S&T.    General  Officers  and  Senior Executive Service (SES) civilians convene to discuss the topics listed above. 10.4.1.2.  Brazil.  Oversight of USAF IAC with  rests with the National Executive Agents (NEA).  The USAF NEA is  the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force,  International Affairs, Director for Policy (IAP) and the Brazilian NEA is the Director of the Aerospace Technical  Center  (CTA).    The  NEA  concept  was  established  in  the  Master  Data Exchange  Agreement  for  the  Mutual  Development  of  Military  Equipment  concluded between  the  Brazilian  Air  Force  and  the  USAF  that  covers  most  current  USAF  IAC activity with Brazil. 10.4.1.3.  Japan.    SAF/IA  conducts  a  regular  Air  Service-to-Service  (S2S)  Dialog  with Japan.  The purpose of this forum, as stated in the mutually agreed Terms of Reference (TOR),  is  to  deepen  mutual  understanding  on  research,  development,  modification,  and T&E  conducted  by  both  Air  Forces.    It  also  contributes  to  the  OSD-led  Systems  and Technology Forum (S&TF) by promoting information exchanges on defense technology and  acquisition-related  matters.    The  co-chairs  of  this  forum  are  the  Head,  Advanced Technology Office,  Air Staff Office and SAF/IAPQ. 10.4.1.4.  The Five-Power ASNR Forum.  The USAF lead for this 2-star level forum with  and the  is the Assistant SAF/IA.  The ASNRs meet one to two times a year to exchange information and oversee ongoing projects initiated within the forum.  Responsibility for hosting meetings rotates among the members.  The Five-Power ASNRs conduct much of   64  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 their  business  under  the  Aeronautical  Cooperative  Research  and  Technology  Projects (RTP) MOU.  The objectives of this MOU are the identification of common R&D needs and the conduct of collaborative projects that lead to the development of technologically superior  and  interoperable  conventional  weapon  systems  with  the  potential  to  improve future, long-term national  and coalition warfighting  capabilities.  The RTP  MOU scope includes  cooperation  in  basic  research,  applied  research,  and  advanced  technology development.    The  Five-Power  ASNRs  form  the  Steering  Committee  (SC)  for  the  RTP MOU,  with  a  subordinate  Working  Group  (WG)  tasked  to  review  the  status  of  existing projects,  explore  cooperative  opportunities,  and  make  regular  reports  to  the  ASNRs.  SAF/AQR provides the U.S. representative to the WG. 10.4.2.  OSD-Led  IAC  Forums.  OSD  meets  periodically  with  a  number  of  nations interested  in  enhancing  or  developing  an  IAC  relationship  with  the  U.S.  depending  on  the particular agenda, the USAF is asked to participate. 10.4.3.  Air  Force  Research  Laboratory  (AFRL)-Led  IAC  Forums.  The  AFRL  holds regular  meetings  with  selected  partner  nations  to  capitalize  on  opportunities  for  S&T  IAC activity. 10.4.4.  The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP).  TTCP is a forum for defense S&T collaboration  between  Australia,  Canada,  New  Zealand,  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  U.S. and is governed by its own MOU.  The aim of TTCP is to foster cooperation in S&T areas needed for enhancing conventional national defense at reduced costs.  To do this, it provides a formal framework that scientists and technologists can use to share information on national programs  to  reduce  duplication,  promote  joint  research,  and  collectively  close  gaps  in  the technology base.  The scope of activities under the TTCP MOU ranges from basic research to JCTDs.  DoDI 3100.8, The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP), and the TTCP website (http://www.dtic.mil/ttcp/) provide further guidance and information. 10.5.

This paper should be releasable to the partner  nation(s)  involved  and  contain  sufficient  detail  that  the  meeting  organizer  and  the AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   65  partner  can  analyze  the  proposal  before  the  forum  takes  place  and  be  prepared  to  make  a decision on the proposal at the meeting.   66  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 Chapter 11 LEGAL AUTHORITIES 11.1.  Purpose and Objectives.  This Chapter briefly describes the legal authorities authorizing the  majority  of  IAC  activities.    The  laws  listed  in  this  Chapter  govern  the  activities  described throughout this AFMAN. 11.2.  Background.  Congress has enacted several laws authorizing components of the Executive Branch  to  enter  into  agreements  with  foreign  nations  for  the  purpose  of  enhancing  mutual defense.    Each  such  law  contains  specific  objectives,  grants  specific  powers,  and  imposes specific  requirements.    Accordingly,  it  is  important  to  select  the  appropriate  legal  authority  to facilitate the negotiation and execution of the proposed IA.  More than one of the following legal authorities may be used or may be required for the execution of a particular IA.  SAF/IAPQ will select  the  appropriate  legal  authority  in  consultation  with  SAF/GCI  whose  concurrence  is required before negotiating or concluding an IA.  The primary statutes authorizing IAs are: 11.2.1.  Title  1  U.  S.C.  §  112b  (Case  Act).    The  Secretary  of  State  (SECSTATE)  shall transmit to Congress the text of any international agreement other than a treaty to which the U.S. is party no later than sixty days after the agreement has entered into force. 11.2.2.  Title  10  U.  S.C.  §  139.    Statue  describes  the  authority  and  responsibilities  of DOT&E. 11.2.3.  Title  10  U.  S.C.  §  168.    Authorizes  SECDEF  to  conduct  military-to-military contacts and comparable activities designed to encourage a democratic orientation of defense establishments and military forces of other countries.  This includes the exchange of civilian or military personnel between the DoD and foreign MODs. 11.2.4.  Title 10 U.  S.C. § 2304c.  Gives rationale for the head of a U.S. Government agency to  be  able  to  use  procedures  other  than  competitive  procedures  when  conducting  a procurement for property or services. 11.2.5.  Title  10  U.  S.C.  §  2457.    Authorizes  SECDEF  to  standardize  U.S.  equipment, including weapons systems, ammunition, and fuel, procured for the use of the armed forces of  the  U.S.  stationed  in  Europe  under  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  or  at  least  to  make  that equipment  interoperable  with  equipment  of  other  NATO  members  to  the  maximum  extent feasible.    Additionally,  gives  SECDEF  authority  to  negotiate  cooperative  agreements  with NATO members. 11.2.6.  Title 10 U.  S.C. § 2350a.  This statute provides authority for cooperative R&D.  It authorizes  the  SECDEF  to  enter  into  a  formal  agreement  with  members  of  NATO,  NATO organizations,  major  non-NATO  allies  and  Friendly  Foreign  Countries  (FFCs)  for  the purpose of conducting cooperative R&D projects on defense equipment and munitions.  All programs  utilizing  NATO  Cooperative  R&D  funds  rely  on  this  legal  authority.    Before entering into a formal agreement, the SECDEF must determine that the proposed project will improve,  through  the  application  of  emerging  technology,  the  conventional  defense capabilities  of  NATO,  or  the  common  defense  capabilities  of  the  U.S.  and  its  allies.    The SECDEF  may  only  delegate the  Deputy  Secretary  of  Defense (DEPSECDEF) or to USD(AT&L).  Title 10 U.S.C. § 2350a requires sharing of the costs of this  authority to AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   67  the project (including the cost of claims) between the participants on an equitable basis.  The allied participant may not use as part of its contribution any funds provided by the U.S. and all  U.S.  funds  must  be  spent  in  the  United  States.    A  thirty  day  notification  to  Congress  is required prior to signing agreements with FFCs.  Although  2350a  and  AECA  Section  27  are  similar  in  many  respects,  there  are  key differences.  Section 27 allows for cooperative and concurrent production efforts and for the U.S.  to  mix  and  consolidate  the  participating  governments’  funding  so  that  the  pilot/lead nation can contract  on behalf of the other(s).  Section 2350a  efforts have no Congressional notification  requirement  prior  to  signing  the  agreement  unless  FFCs  are  involved.    An additional  eight  nations  are  extended  FFC  designation  under  2350a  –  Bahrain,  Jordan, Morocco,  New  Zealand,  Pakistan,  the  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Taiwan.    However,  these nations are designated as major non-NATO allies under AECA Section 65 which authorizes loans but not cooperative production. 11.2.6.1.  Title 10 U.S.C. § 2350a(e).  This statute requires a Cooperative Opportunities Document (COD) that includes a statement regarding similar projects in development or production  in  another  country;  whether  that  project  could  satisfy  a  U.S.  military requirement;  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  on  project  timing,  costs,  technology sharing  and  Rationalization,  Standardization,  and  Interoperability  (RSI);  and  a recommendation as to the feasibility and desirability of a cooperative development.  This requirement  applies  to  all  Acquisition  Category  I  (ACAT  I)  programs  before  the  first milestone  or  decision  point.    The  COD  is  documented  in  Technology  Development Strategy (TDS) for Milestone A and Acquisition Strategy (AS) for subsequent milestones as required per DoDI 5000.02. 11.2.6.2.  Title 10 U.S.C. § 2350a(g).  Authorizes SECDEF to test conventional defense equipment,  munitions,  and  technologies  manufactured  and  developed  by  NATO,  a NATO  organization,  a  NATO  member,  major  non-NATO  allies,  and  any  other  FFC,  to determine  the  ability  of  such  equipment,  munitions,  and  technologies  to  satisfy  U.S. military requirements or to correct operational deficiencies. 11.2.7.  Title 10 U.  S.C. § 2350b.  This statute provides authority for other nations to award contracts  and  subcontracts  on  behalf  of  the  U.S.    The  SECDEF,  the  DEPSECDEF,  or USD(AT&L)  may  waive  standard  contracting  provisions  if  the  project  is  determined  to significantly further RSI.  This is done through a signed Determination and Findings (D&F) statement (Attachment 1.4 – Websites AFI 65-116). 11.2.8.  Title  10  U.  S.C.  §  2350l.    Authorizes  SECDEF,  with  the  concurrence  of SECSTATE, to enter into an MOU (or other formal agreement) for the reciprocal testing of defense equipment.  Section 2350l  further defines the payment  of costs  associated with  the reciprocal testing. 11.2.9.  Title  10  U.  S.C.  §  2358.    This  statute  authorizes  the  SECDEF  or  a  MILDEP  to engage in basic research, applied research, advanced research, and development projects.  It can  be  used  as  authority  for  cooperating  in  these  areas  with  a  foreign  government  or international governmental organization pursuant to an IA.  Section 2358 is often referred to as “general R&D authority.”   68  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013 11.2.10.  Title  10  U.  S.C.  §  2371.    Authorizes  SECDEF  or  MILDEP  to  enter  into transactions (other than  contracts,  cooperative  agreements, and  grants) in  order to  carry out basic, applied, and advanced research projects. 11.2.11.  Title 15 U.  S.C. § 3710a.  Authorizes each federal agency to permit the director of any government-operated federal laboratories, and when permitted, the director of any of its government-owned,  contractor-operated  laboratories,  to  enter  into  cooperative  R&D agreements on behalf of the requesting agency with other federal agencies; units of State or local government; industrial organizations (including corporations, partnerships, and limited partnerships,  and  industrial  development  organizations);  public  and  private  foundations, nonprofit  organizations  (including  universities);  or  other  persons  (included  licensees  of inventions owned by the federal agency). 11.2.12.  Title 22 U.  S.C. § 2321k.  The President shall notify Congress at least thirty days before designating or terminating a country as a major non-NATO ally. 11.2.13.  Title 22 U.  S.C. § 2767 (Section 27).  Section 27 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA)  provides  broad  authority  for  research,  development,  and  acquisition.    It  authorizes the  President  to  enter  into  cooperative  projects  with  members  of  NATO  and  certain  FFCs.  DoD reports annually to Congress on all agreements concluded under Section 27.  Section 27 permits partners to contract on behalf of one another; loan material, equipment, and supplies; share  the  cost  of  claims,  and  also  authorizes  U.S.  procurement  of  foreign  defense  articles.  When another nation contracts on behalf of the U.S. using this authority, a D&F pursuant to Title 10 U.S.C. 2350b must be approved prior to the transfer of U.S. funds to be placed on contract.    Section  27  requires  equitable  sharing  of  the  total  project  costs  and  joint  project management.  The DoD makes a thirty day notification to Congress prior to signature of the IA. 11.2.14.  Title 22 U.  S.C. § 2796.  Leases of defense articles under Section 61 of the AECA may  be  used  for  cooperative  RDT&E  purposes  and  may  be  rent  free.    Section  61  leases require  a  written  agreement,  either  as  a  stand-alone  Loan  Agreement  (LA)  or  as  part  of  a broader  IA.    Conditions  for  these  leases  are  covered  in  detail  in  Chapter  11  of  the  DoD Manual 5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual.  All lease costs must be paid by  the  foreign  partner  or  international  governmental  organization,  to  include  depreciation, restoration  or  replacement,  if  required.    Section  61  leases  may  be  used  for  countries  or international  governmental  organizations  that  are  neither  NATO  members  nor  major  non-NATO allies. 11.2.15.  Title  22  U.  S.C.  §  2796d  (Section  65).    Section  65  of  the  AECA  authorizes  the loan of materials, supplies, or equipment for R&D purposes.  It requires a written agreement, either as a stand-alone LA or as part of a broader IA.  Section 65 authorizes the SECDEF to make loans to members of NATO or major non-NATO allies, and to accept as a loan or gift from such countries, non-strategic and non-critical materials, supplies, or equipment for the      AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   69      purpose of conducting a cooperative RDT&E program.  If the U.S. is the lender, it must incur no costs and must receive a report of the results of the foreign testing or evaluation without charge.  If the item loaned is not expendable, it must be returned to the USAF in its original configuration.  The implications of expending or consuming a loaned item are addressed in the  DoD  Financial  Management  Regulation,  and  may  be  authorized  by  SECDEF  under Section 65.  HEIDI H.

The term “negotiation” includes any such communication even though conditioned on later approval by the responsible authority.  The term “negotiation” also includes provision of a draft agreement or  other  document,  the  acceptance  of  which  would  constitute  an  agreement,  as  well  as discussions  concerning  any  U.S.  or  foreign  government  or  international  governmental organization draft document whether or not titled “agreement.”  The term “negotiation” does not include preliminary or exploratory discussions or routine meetings where no draft documents are discussed, so long as such discussions or meetings are conducted with the understanding that the views communicated do not and will not bind or commit any side, legally or otherwise. Other  Transaction  (OT)—  OTs  are  flexible  agreements  other  than  contracts,  grants,  or cooperative agreements that are used to accomplish various legal purposes.  OTs are not subject to statutes and regulations that apply specifically to contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements.  There  are  two  types  of  OTs;  (1)  OTs  for  research  authorized  by  Title  10  U.S.C.  2371,  and  (2) OTs for the acquisition of prototype projects relevant to weapon systems authorized by  Section 845 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1994, Public Law 103-160. Party— Any government (including its agencies, instrumentalities, or political subdivisions) or international governmental organization that is a signatory to an IA.

Proponents may be at any USAF organizational level. Quid—Pro-Quo (QPQ) Analysis — A statement of comparative benefits used as the rationale or justification for approval of a DEA or IEA by the USAF. Rationalization, Standardization, Interoperability (RSI)— (Rationalization)  Any action that increases the effectiveness of partner forces through more efficient and effective use of defense resources.    Rationalization  includes  consolidation,  reassignment  of  national  priorities  to  higher needs,  standardization,  specialization,  mutual  support  or  improved  interoperability,  and  greater cooperation.  Rationalization applies to  both  weapons and materiel  resources and non-weapons military  matters.    (Standardization)    The  process  by  which  the  DoD  achieves  the  closest practicable  cooperation  among  forces  for  the  most  efficient  use  of  research,  development,  and production resources, and agrees to adopt on the broadest possible basis the use of: a) common or  compatible  operational,  administrative,  and  logistic  procedures;  b)  common  and  compatible AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   83  technical  procedures  and  criteria;  c)  common,  compatible,  or  interchangeable  supplies, components,  weapons,  or  equipment;  and  d)  common  or  compatible  tactical  doctrine  with corresponding organizational  compatibility.  (Interoperability)  The ability of systems,  units, or forces  to  provide  data,  information,  material,  and  services  to  and  accept  services  from  other systems, units, or forces and to use the data, information, material, and services so exchanged to enable them to cooperate effectively together. Summary Statement of Intent (SSOI)— A U.S.-only document that constitutes a summary of the  IA,  which  provides  information  pertaining  to  the  operational  requirement  of  the  associated proposed project; identification of the partner nation(s); applicable legal authority; benefits/risk to  the  U.S.;  potential  industrial  base  impact;  funding  availability;  procurement;  information security and technology transfer issues; and proponents of the project. Technical  Project  Officer  (TPO)—  The  individual  responsible  for  exercising  day-to-day management  of  assigned  IEA  efforts  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  IEA.  This  individual  is  the  single  point  of  contact  for  implementation  of  information  exchanges  and approval of visits under an annex, and is the only individual authorized to make exchanges under the annex.  TPOs assigned to IEAs must possess the technical expertise encompassing the scope of the annex.  For IEAs under which the scientific or technical area to be pursued is applicable to several functional areas, an ATPO may perform technical supervision over a specified segment or portion of an IEA.

Drafting a Preliminary or Exploratory Discussions Template. A2.1.1.  This format is for completing required information that will eventually be included in  a  PA.    This  technical  content  should  be  thoroughly  discussed  and  jointly  developed between the allied partners, based on national and common objectives and equitable sharing of  tasks/responsibilities  and  contributions.    Concentrate  on  the  technical  content  of  your proposed project rather than the format of the verbiage – your information will be later used to  develop  a  draft  agreement  by  international  staffing  specialists.    This  document  does  not imply  any  commitment  and  is  to  facilitate  joint  technical  planning  discussions  only--this  is not a negotiation document. A2.1.2.  While  completing  this  document,  keep  in  mind  that  the  authorities  reviewing  the proposed  project  agreement  at  HQ  USAF  and  OSD  are  not  likely  technical  experts  in  this technology area.  Please keep project details simple and concise.  The objectives and tasks of the  proposed  agreement  must  be  easy  to  understand  by  all  parties  reviewing,  coordinating, and/or signing the agreement at HQ USAF and OSD. AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   85  Figure A2.1.

The  U.S.-only  SSOI  describes  the  scope  and  content  of  a  proposed  International Agreement (IA).  The SSOI provides insight into the rationale and specifics of a proposed IA and is a crucial document in the IA development process.  The SSOI is the basis upon which SAF/IA  and/or  OUSD(AT&L)  provides  authority  to  develop  and  negotiate  an  IA.    It  is important  to  be  thorough  and  accurate,  yet  concise,  in  completing  the  SSOI.    SSOIs  for amendments  to  existing  IAs  will  be  in  an  abbreviated  format  and  will  address  only  the proposed changes to the approved original SSOI and the current status of the program to be amended.    The  abbreviated  SSOI  will  address,  at  a  minimum,  the  current  status  of  the program, remaining scope to be accomplished, and an updated financial summary (i.e. funds expended  to  date  and  projected  funding)  together  with  the  justification  for  the  amendment.  The information in italics below is for guidance and should be removed before submission.  The  template  for  the  SSOI  is  updated  regularly  as  a  result  of  OUSD(AT&L)  and  MILDEP discussions,  so  proponents  should  work  with  SAF/IAPQ  to  ensure  they  are  using  the  latest version of the SSOI template. AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   91  Figure A2.3.

Master  Data  Exchange  Agreements  (MDEAs)  are  older-style  agreements,  but  they remain  in  effect  because  of  the  way  the  negotiators  developed  the  original  signed  text.  Because most MDEAs do not have a format attached to them, USAF proponents should use the following as a guide for drafting a new DEA.  AFMAN16-114  16 MAY 2013   109  Figure A3.2.
