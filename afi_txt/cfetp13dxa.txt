IAW AFPD 10-35, Battlefield Airmen, 13DX is a Battlefield Airmen career field that conducts unique surface operations integral to the application of air and space power.  This CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle qualification, education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field initial training.    2.    The  CFETP  consists  of  two  parts;  officers,  supervisors,  commanders  and  trainers  use  both  parts  to  plan, manage, and control training within the career field.    2.1.    Part  I  provides  information  necessary  for  overall  management  of  the  specialty.    Section  A  explains how everyone will use the plan.  Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and a common career field path.  Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other).  Section D indicates resource constraints (some examples are funds, manpower,  equipment,  and  facilities).    Section  E  explains  documentation  at  each  level  of  training.    Section  F explains certification and de-certification at each level of qualification.      2.2.  Part II includes five sections that provide a comprehensive look at training requirements and standards, as well  as  sources  to  obtain  that  training.    Section  A  identifies  the  Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS);  includes duties,  tasks,  and  technical  references  to  support  Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT);  and  lists  Air  Education and  Training  Command  (AETC)  training.    Section  B  contains  the  course  objective  list  and  training  standards supervisors will use to determine if officers have satisfied training requirements.  Section C identifies available support materials.  An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP), which may be developed to support upgrade  or  proficiency  training;  these  packages  are  available  at  the  e-Publishing  website,  www.e-publishing.af.mil.    Section  D  identifies  a  training  course  index  supervisors  can  use  to  determine  resources available  to  support  training:    included  are  both  mandatory  and  optional  courses.    Section  E  identifies MAJCOM-unique  training  requirements  supervisors  can  use  to  determine  additional  training  required  for  the associated qualification needs.    3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training  at  appropriate  points  in  their  career.    This  plan  enables  us  to  train  today’s  force  for  tomorrow’s operational  demands.    At  the  unit  level,  supervisors  and  trainers  use  Part  II  to  validate  initial  training competencies  and  to  conduct  training  commensurate  with  the  overall  goals  of  this  plan.  Additionally,  the following individuals must comply with but are not limited to the duties and responsibilities indicated:  3.1.  Individual: Individuals will complete skill set requirements IAW Part II of the CFETP.  Upon successful completion  of  IQT,  individuals  will  be  awarded  13D3.    Subsequent  upgrade  to  Team  Commander  (TC)  and Mission Commander (MC) is also outlined within the CFETP.  Individuals should check their records to ensure the 13D3 qualification has been awarded.  3.2.  Unit  Training  Manager  (UTM):  Basic responsibilities are outlined in AFI 36-2201 Air Force Training Program  Career  Field  Education  and  Training.    Unit  responsibilities  include  loading  member  CFETP  into electronic training records and assisting the supervisor and commander in developing the Master Task Listing (MTL) and Individual Training Plan (ITP) for assigned 13D3s.  UTMs will grant supervisors and commanders access to all members’ electronic training records.  3.3.    Supervisor/Operations  Officer:    Supervisors  and  operations  officers  will  ensure  officer  trainees understand the fundamentals of each CFETP task, manage and control officer progression consistent with career field  direction,  and  document  follow-on  unit  training  in  the  CFETP;  except  in  the  case  of  performance-based tasks  where  the  task  may  be  signed  off  by  a  qualified  trainer  or  instructor.    They  will  verify  that  pre-3  task/task/post-task actions are included for follow-on training, identify tasks in addition to core tasks, and certify completion of training.  3.4.  Squadron Commander:  Squadron commanders, or equivalent, are responsible for ensuring their assigned officers meet the requirements of the CFETP.  The squadron commander (or next higher authority) will certify the officer’s progression by documenting task completion on the “Training Completion Certification” sheet in the CFETP, ensuring 13D3 certification has been awarded and updated in an officer’s personnel record.  3.5.  Group Commander:  Group commanders will monitor the effectiveness of training; notifying MAJCOMs of formal training shortfalls, ensure timely correction and redirection of formal training emphasis, and develop a solid CRO orientation program to ensure the best possible training environment.   4  ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED   Advanced  Training  (AT).

Purpose.  This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional manager (MFM), commanders, training pipeline manager (TPM), training manager (TM), course manager (CM), supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial qualification is the AFS-specific training an officer requires for entry into the Air  Force  or  upon  retraining  into  this  specialty  for  award  of  the  1-skill  level.    Upgrade  training  identifies  the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence completion requirements for award of an advanced skill (3, 4) level.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify  an  officer  in  a  specific  duty  position.    This  training  occurs  both  during  and  after  the  upgrade  training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal  specialty  training  used  for  selected  officers.    Proficiency  training  is  additional  training,  either  in-residence  or  exportable  advanced  training  courses,  or  on-the-job  training  (OJT),  provided  to  personnel  to increase  their  skills  and  knowledge  beyond  the  minimum  required  for  upgrade.    This  CFETP  has  several purposes, some are:   1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  Also, it is used to help commanders and supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career.   1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual's career.   1.3.    Lists  training  courses  available  in  the  specialty,  identifies  sources  of  training,  and  the  training  delivery method.   1.4.    Identifies  major  resource  constraints,  which  impact  implementation  of  the  desired  career  field  training process.   2.    Use.  The plan will be used by MFMs, commanders and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.   2.1.    AETC  training  personnel  will  develop/revise  formal  resident,  nonresident,  field  and  exportable  training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with  the  AFCFM  to  develop  acquisition  strategies  for  obtaining  resources  needed  to  provide  the  identified training.   2.2.    MFMs  will  ensure  their  training  programs  complement  the  CFETP  mandatory  initial,  upgrade,  and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses may satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion in this plan.   2.3.    Each  individual  will  complete  the  mandatory  training  requirements  specified  in  this  plan.    The  lists  of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.   2.4.    Qualification  Training  Packages  (QTPs)  are  developed  and  maintained  by  MFMs  and/or  units  in coordination  with  AETC.    Unit-developed  QTPs  will  be  provided  to  their  MAJCOM  for  approval  and,  upon approval by the AFCFM, will be included in the CFETP course index (Part II, Section C).   3.  Coordination and Approval.  The CFETP is approved and maintained by the AFCFM in accordance with (IAW)  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program  Career  Field  Education  and  Training.    Forward recommended changes to AETC/A3T with follow-on coordination to the AFCFM, HQ USAF/A3OS. MAJCOM requests  for  additional  training  must  either  be  accompanied  by  funding  or  must  be  satisfied  within  existing 9  resources. The AFCFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AETC training manager for this specialty is  required to  initiate  an  annual review  of  this  document  IAW  AETCI  36-2203,  Technical  and  Basic Military Training  with  AETC  and  MFMs  to  ensure  currency  and  accuracy.    Using  the  list  of  courses  in  Part  II  will eliminate duplicate training.    Section B – CAREER FIELD INFORMATION AND PROGRESSION  4.    Specialty  Description.    The  CRO  AFS  provides  command  and  control  of  Personnel  Recovery  (PR) operations;  organizing,  training,  and  equipping  assigned  personnel  to  conduct  those  operations  in  support  of combatant commander requirements.

The award of the 4-level occurs immediately upon being assigned to a staff position above wing  level  and  completion  of  recommended  courses.    Normally,  the  CRO  will  have  eight  or  more  years  of experience in PR operations unless waived by the CFM.   6.  Career Development.  AF/DP mandates that each AFS develop a career development plan to illustrate the professional and specialty knowledge required at various chronological check points in an officers’ career.   6.1.  13DX Career Progression, Table 1.  6.2.  13DX Career Development Matrix, Table 2.   6.3.  13DX Career Planning Diagram, Figure 1.    7.  Career Path/Training Flow.  Experience and knowledge in this AFS will help an officer plan and achieve their  Air  Force  career  goals  as  a  CRO.    Table  2  describes  the  career  path/training  opportunities  and  outlines when training is required for career progression within this specialty.  7.1.  When initially assigned to  a first duty assignment, officers are expected to build depth through technical and tactical experience within the PR arena.   7.2.    After  initial  assignment  there  are  various  paths  available  to  reach  senior  level  CRO  positions.    Several permanent change of station (PCS) moves are normally required to experience these aspects to sufficient depth. Career broadening opportunities will provide additional breadth.  Section C – PROFICIENCY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS  Purpose.  Proficiency training requirements are defined in terms of tasks and knowledge requirements and are identified in the STS at Part II, Section A and B of this CFETP.  This section outlines the specialty qualification requirements for entry, award, and retention of each AFS level.  The specific knowledge training requirements are identified in Part II.  11   8.  Specialty Qualification Requirements.    8.1.  TC Qualification.  A normal upgrade window for completion of all MQT items is 120-days.  A mandatory Director  of  Operations  (or  organizational  equivalent)  review  will  be  conducted  at  the  120-day  mark.    A mandatory Commander review will be conducted at the 150-day mark.  No MQT upgrade will exceed 180-days from start to finish.  TC MQT qualifications require an evaluation which will cover the MQT material instructed during the upgrade.  8.2.    MC  Qualification.   MC  upgrade-related  continuation  training  items  should  be  completed  during  the  first RQS  assignment.    If  it  is  identified  that  MC  training  will  not  be  completed  by  the  end  of  an  CRO’s  first assignment,  steps  will  be  taken  to  complete  advanced  tactical  events  requiring  RQS  resources  prior  to reassignment in order to complete as much of the MC qualification as possible.  Many of the MC items required for qualification can be completed outside of an RQS.   NOTE: CROs already in their second assignment prior to the publishing date of this CFETP may be qualified as MCs  at  the  discretion  of  their  commanders,  provided  they  have  completed  a  careful  review  of  the  STS  and current MC qualification-level development requirements.  This commander’s option must be documented in the CRO’s training record along with the date the MC qualification is awarded.  8.3.  Knowledge.

Officers will develop depth on their first unit level assignment by gaining experience both as a leader and a functional expert.  CRO candidates will report to their gaining operational unit before beginning the pipeline, then return for their first operational duties following graduation as a 3-level TC.   2.  Mission Commander Qualification should be completed as best as able prior to a second ops assignment (see 8.2 above).  Completion  of  instructor  upgrade  during  a  first  assignment  is  desirable  for  CROs  demonstrating  the  necessary  skills  and experience.     3.  For a second assignment, officers should consider instructor duty or  flight commander positions at rescue, training, or special tactics squadrons (STS).  4.  Senior Captains and Majors should consider staff and evaluator positions, as well as assistant operations officer duties to gain  valuable  experience  and  further  their  development.    Some  officers  will  fill  staff  positions  within  their  respective SQ/GP/WG (executive officer, standardization and evaluation, weapons and tactics, and  wing plans positions, just to name a few) commensurate with their current qualifications.  Others will serve at higher headquarters.  5.    The  12-year  experience  point  is  generally  when  a  CRO  major  will  be  fully  qualified  and  prepared  to  succeed  at  any squadron leadership position.    6.  It is desirable for squadron commanders to have completed a HHQ staff position.    7.  Post squadron command, officers should consider joint staff, combatant command, and group/wing leadership positions.  Those officers who do not command still maintain numerous opportunities to serve higher headquarters staffs.   15    Table 2. 13DX Career Planning Matrix 13DX CAREER PLANNING MATRIX  Level  Core Assignment   Core Experiences   Education   Training  Developmental Assignments (DIDs)  SOS  AFIT  IDE SDE AFIP IDE   JPME II  SDE IQT/MQT  JSOU/AFSOS  JAOC  ROCO Jumpmaster AOCIQT-PR  JPRA courses Dive Supervisor Sq/CC Course  Gp/CC Course CWPC  JAOC  PR-301/303    80C – Cadet Sq/Cc, USAFA  88A – Aide-de-Camp  88P - Protocol   16F – FAO   16G/P/R   SDE  JPME II   16G/P/R  63A - Acquisitions    Tactical   Assistant Flight CC Flight CC Instructor  Asst Director of Ops  Evaluator  Sq/DO Sq/CC Gp/CD Gp/CC Wing/CC Operational    MAJCOM Staff Joint Duty  Sub-Unified Commands  Strategic  MAJCOM Staff HAF Staff  Unified Commands  Joint Staff  AEF/JFEX  Mobility  Logistics  Planning  Deployment  JTF Staff  Command  Staff  Planning  Logistics  Programming  Budgeting  Command  Staff  Planning  Programming  Budgeting  Personnel     Figure 1.

This section identifies known resource constraints precluding optimal/desired training from being developed  or  conducted,  including  information  such  as  cost  and  manpower.  Narrative  explanations  of  each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included.  Also included in this section are actions required, office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates.  Resource constraints will be, as a minimum, reviewed and updated annually.   10.  Training:   10.1.  Entry Level Training:  10.1.1.    Formal  School  Constraint.    Formal  school  availability  and  sequencing  during  the  Initial  Qualification Training pipeline is not currently provided at the level needed and may lengthen overall pipeline.  All 13D1 are required to attend S-V94-C prior to attending CRO Course.  10.1.2.    Additional  SERE Constraint.    All 13D1  will  eventually  attend  portions  of  S-V81-A  (having  begun  in 2009) in conjunction with S-V94-C.  Line items 5.5.8 and 5.5.9 will be accomplished once trainees attend these portions.  The SERE school is performing a Cost Resource Estimate (CRE) which addresses this requirement.  Until then, students will graduate without these items.   10.2.  Qualified Level Training:  No constraint exists  10.3.  Staff Level Training: No constraint exists.   Section E – DOCUMENTATION  13.  Training records.  An AF Form 623, Individual Training Record will be maintained for all CRO personnel in  the  grades  of  O-1  thru  O-4.    Maintenance  of  training  folders  for  officers  in  the  rank  of  O-5  and  above  is optional unless the CRO is assigned to a tactical unit.     14.    Records  Documentation.    Documentation  is  an  important  part  of  the  training  and  evaluation  process.  Concise  and  factual  documentation  provides  a  history  of  tasks  accomplished  and  the  conditions  under  which they  were  accomplished.  Proper  documentation  supports the trend analysis program,  an  important  part  of  the command and unit cross-tell programs.  Improper documentation results in a poor or incomplete picture of the individual’s  performance  and  may  hinder  the  commander/supervisor  as  he  prepares  the  individual  for  career development or re-trains the officer for re-qualification evaluation.  An individual training and evaluation folder will  be  opened  at  the  officer’s  first  duty  station  and  will  be  transferred  with  the  CRO  upon  each  permanent change  of  assignment.    Unless  on  Temporary  Duty,  the  Tab  5,  Evaluation  Record  will  be  located  in  the Standards and Evaluations (Stan/Eval) section for security of evaluation documents.  Maintenance responsibility for the folder is shared by Stan/Eval and training sections per direction in paragraph 15.    15.  Individual Training and Evaluation Folder.  The unit training office will build and maintain the officer’s folder upon arrival at his first duty station.  Use of a 1.5 inch 3-ring binder is the approved method of managing the individual training and evaluation documentation.  Place an 8x12 inch paper placard into the front cover of the  binder  which  contains  the  title  “INDIVIDUAL  TRAINING  and  EVALUATION  FOLDER”  with  the officer’s full name and rank on a separate line, AFSC and duty title on the next line, and unit of assignment on the last line.  The bottom of the placard should contain the following privacy act statement: "This document may contain  information  which  must  be  protected  IAW  AFI  33-332  Privacy  Act  Program  and  DoD  Regulation 5400.11,  Privacy  Act  of  1974  as  amended  applies,  and  it  is  For  Official  Use  Only  (FOUO)."    All  text  on  the binder  cover  will  be  formatted  in  Times  New  Roman,  14  font,  bold  print.    Use  of  a  3-ring  binder  provides  a 17  more  durable  hard  cover,  allows  ease  of  reading,  and  also  enables  the  user  to  easily  add/remove  changes.  Divide the individual training and evaluation folder into eight tabs:   15.1.  Tab 1 – CFETP.  Place a copy of the current version.    15.2.  Tab 2 – AF Form 623a on the job training (OJT) continuation sheet document IAW 36-2201, Vol. 3.  All 623a  entries  should  provide  supporting  documentation  for  any  subsequent  evaluation  annotated  on  AF  Form 803.   15.3.  Tab 3 – Mission Ready Training Forms.    15.3.1  Tab 3.1 – AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification Recurring Training.  This form is used to record recurring training if not recorded in unit training management products.    15.3.2.    Tab  3.2  –  Command  Job  Qualification  Standard  (JQS).    Maintain  a  record  of  required  Air  Force ancillary training either in this tab or in a central location if not recorded in unit training management products.   15.3.3.  Tab 3.3 – ARMS product.  AFORMS will be used to track training.  Retain all management products in this tab or a central location.  The product must be returned to this tab if the individual deploys with the training record or makes a permanent change of station (PCS) move.   15.4.  Tab 4 – Evaluation Record.  Evaluation records are retained  in this tab IAW AFI 10-3502, Vol. 2, and      maintained by the Stan/Eval section.    15.5.4. Tab 4.1 – Basic Qualifications and Advanced Skills Documentation.  Maintain a copy of current special orders and/or commander’s certification letters placing individual on or removing from specialty qualifications.    15.5.    Tab  5  –  Individual  Dive  Record.    US  Navy  Dive  Reporting  System  (DRS)  software  may  be  used  to generate dive reports.  Utilize website http://www.safetycenter.navy.mil/afloat/diving/drs/ to locate software.  If software at  website, https://www.afsoc.af.mil/milonly/library1/forms/AFSOC10.xfdlDD to record and maintain a historical record of individual dive training.    15.6.  Tab 6 – AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons Training Data.  The form(s) may be maintained in this tab or a central location, but must be returned to this tab if the individual deploys with the training record or makes a PCS move. 522s are maintained by the training section.   15.7.

Purpose.    The  purpose  of  this  STS  is  to  identify  core  specialty  tasks  required  by  the  functional  user  to accomplish the mission of a CRO.  This STS describes a CRO in terms of  the tasks and knowledge which an individual  in  this  specialty  may  be  expected  to  perform  after  pre-requisite  initial  qualification  training,  and identifies  the  training  provided.    Furthermore,  this  STS  documents  which  overall  initial  training  requirements are taught in formal schools and which are correspondence courses.   18  2.  Documentation.    2.1.  Column 1.  Task, Knowledge, and Technical References (TR).  This column identifies the core tasks and knowledge  necessary  for  officers  to  perform  duties  in  the  1,  3,  and  4  levels.    It  also  provides  applicable  TR.  Task statements are numbered sequentially (i.e. 1.1, 1.2, and 2.1.)    2.2.  Column 2.  13D1 Prerequisite Pipeline Course Skill Level.  Prerequisite skills are defined as requirements acquired  through  prerequisite  courses.    This  column  identifies  the  prerequisite  course  number  and  the proficiency  code  of  the  tasks  and  knowledge  to  be  acquired  during  that  course  prior  to  the  AFSC  awarding initial qualification  training  course.    If  no  prerequisite  skill is identified and a  proficiency  code is  provided  in Column 3, the skill will be taught in the CRO Course (L3OBP13D1--0R0D).  2.3.  Column 3.  13D3 CRO Course Skill Level.  This column identifies tasks and knowledge acquired during the  AFSC-awarding  course.    Proficiency  codes  are  used  to  indicate  skill  level  performance  required.  This column  indicates  the  proficiency  to  be  demonstrated  by  the  graduate  as  a  result  of  training  on  the  task  and knowledge.  Each  STS  task  has  a  documented  proficiency  code.    The  details  of  each  statement  and  the  verb selected  reflect  the  level  of  training  required.  CRO  Course  requirements  do  not  change  for  wartime  courses.  Task and knowledge coding is explained in the Proficiency Code Key, Table 1.  2.4  Column 4.  Team Commander (TC).  This column identifies tasks and knowledge acquired during unit TC MQT.    Proficiency  codes  are  used  to  indicate  the  skill  level  performance  required.  This  column  indicates  the proficiency to be demonstrated by the upgrade trainee as a result of training on the task and knowledge.  Each STS  task  has  a  documented  proficiency  code.    The  details  of  each  statement  and  the  verb  selected  reflect  the level  of  training  required.    TC  MQT  requirements  do  not  change  for  wartime  courses.    Task  and  knowledge coding is explained in the Proficiency Code Key, Table 1.  2.5  Column 5.  Mission Commander (MC).  This column identifies tasks and knowledge acquired during unit MC  CT.    Proficiency  codes  are  used  to  indicate  skill  level  performance  required.    This  column  indicates  the proficiency to be demonstrated by the upgrade trainee as a result of training on the task and knowledge.  Each STS  task  has  a  documented  proficiency  code.    The  details  of  each  statement  and  the  verb  selected  reflect  the level of training required. MC CT requirements do not change for wartime courses.  Task and knowledge coding is explained in the Proficiency Code Key, Table 1.  2.6.  Standard STS.  The 13D1 IQT pipeline is unique among officer training programs in that this STS provides it  the  common  guidance  across  multiple  training  courses  in  order  to  ultimately  qualify  personnel  in  the  13D AFS.   3.

This Specialty Training Standard defines the scope of the qualification and upgrade syllabi for Team Commander and Mission Commander.  Required upgrade tasks and standards shall be derived from Part II, Section A of this CFETP.  11.2    Capstone  employment  events.    The  employment  knowledge  and  skills  identified  in  the  Specialty  Training Standard,  Section  11  summary  above  shall  comprise  the  required  employment  evaluation  events  for  Combat  Rescue Officer upgrade.    NOTE:  The events listed need not be exclusive from one another.  As an example, a mass casualty recovery operation could technical  rescue  requirements,  or environmental conditions (such as urban terrain or maritime).  The same operation will necessarily include and highlight terminal  area  skills  and  knowledge.    However,  in  the  case  of  each  category,  the  evaluation  itself  may  not  capture  all subordinate  skill  requirements  previously  demonstrated.    Furthermore,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  units  conducting upgrade to determine the specific areas for mastery during the evaluation.  As an example, leadership of technical rescue operations could include a variety of special skills highlighted in Section 5 (Rescue and Recovery Operations), ranging from technical extrication to high angle recovery. .include  complexity  derived  from infiltration/exfiltration  constraints, 38  Section B – Course Objective List  Course objectives are identified in course documents maintained at individual courses.
