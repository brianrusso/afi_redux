This  instruction  establishes  guidance  and  procedures  on  the  conduct  of  B-52 aircrew evaluations.  All evaluations will be conducted in accordance with (IAW) the provisions of  AFI  11-202V2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation  Program,  and instruction.  Information  gathering  documents  will  be  established  as  forms  in  accordance  with  AFI  33-360, Publications and Forms Management. this 1.2.  Waivers.  All requirements within this AFI are tiered to indicate the waiver authority. 1.2.1.  Tier 0:  The waiver authority is external to the Air Force (e.g. Congress, White House, FAA) 1.2.2.  Tier 1:  The waiver authority is the MAJCOM/CC, delegable no lower than MAJCOM Director, with the concurrence of the AFI Certifying Official. 1.2.3.  Tier  2:    The  waiver  authority  is  the  MAJCOM/CC  (delegable  no  lower  than MAJCOM Director) 1.2.4.  Tier  3:    The  waiver  authority  is  the  Wing/DRU/FOA/CC  (delegable  no  lower  than Group/CC or equivalent) 1.3.  Procedures. 1.3.1.  Flight  Examiners  (FEs)  will  use  the  evaluation  criteria  contained  in  Chapter  3  and Chapter 4 to conduct all flight, Aircrew Training Device (ATD), and Emergency Procedure Evaluations  (EPE).    (T-2).    To  ensure  standard  and  objective  evaluations,  flight  examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.  (T-2). 1.3.2.  In order to ensure the most comprehensive and objective evaluation, the FE should not occupy  a  primary  crew  position  during  evaluations.    However,  if  conditions  warrant  (e.g. DNIF  crewmember),  the  flight  examiner  may  occupy  a  primary  crew  position  during  an evaluation.  While occupying a primary crew position, the FE will execute the duties of that position.  (T-2). 1.3.3.  The FE will explain the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be conducted prior to flight.  (T-2).  The examinee will accomplish all required mission planning in accordance with his/her crew position during the evaluation.  (T-2).  FEs will be furnished a copy of the necessary charts, flight logs, target folders, and any additional items he/she deems necessary.  (T-2). 1.3.4.  The  FE  will  thoroughly  debrief  all  aspects  of  the  flight.    (T-2).    This  debrief  will include the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified), and any required additional training.  (T-2). 1.4.  Grading  Instructions.  Standards  and  performance  parameters  are  contained  in  AFI  11-202, Volume 2 and this instruction. 1.4.1.  Evaluation criteria are based on crewmember qualification as follows: 1.4.1.1.  (P)  is used to denote Pilots and Instructor Pilots. AFI11-2B-52V2  18 MARCH 2015   5  1.4.1.2.  (CP)  is used to denote Copilots. 1.4.1.3.  (DSN)  is used to denote Dual Seat Navigators (DSN) and Instructor DSNs. 1.4.1.5.  (E)  is used to denote Electronic Warfare Officers. 1.4.1.6.  Weapons  Qualified  Crewmembers  (N/A  AFMC).    For  purposes  of  this instruction,  weapons  qualified  crewmembers  include  all  pilots,  DSNs  and  weapons school graduates. 1.4.2.  The FE will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air. (T-2).    Do  not  consider  momentary  deviations  from  tolerances  provided  the  examinee  applies prompt  corrective  action  and  such  deviations  do  not  jeopardize  flying  safety.    The  FE  will consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.  (T-2). 1.4.2.1.  When  grading  criteria  specify  that  airspeed  will  be  evaluated  and  the  flight manual  lists  only  a  minimum/maximum/recommended  airspeed  for  that  area,  the examinee will brief the desired airspeed.  (T-2). 1.4.3.  The  FE  will  compare  examinee  performance  for  each  area  accomplished  during  the evaluation with the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the area.  (T-2).    Determine  the  overall  flight  evaluation  grade  from  the  area  grades  based  on  a composite of the observed events and tasks IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, evaluator judgment, and this instruction. 1.4.3.1.  FEs  will  use  the  grading  criteria  in  this  volume  to  determine  individual  area grades.    (T-2).    Exercise  sound  judgment  when  the  wording  of  areas  is  subjective  and when specific situations are not covered. 1.4.3.2.  If  the  examinee  receives  an  unqualified  grade  in  any  of  the  critical  areas identified in this volume, the FE must assign an overall qualification level of 3. (T-2).  If the examinee fails any ground requisite or receives an unqualified grade in any area, the FE must assign an overall qualification level of no higher than 2.  (T-2).  Otherwise, FE judgment is the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade. 1.4.3.3.  The following  general criteria apply  during  all phases of  flight  except  as noted for specific events and instrument final approaches: Table 1.1.  General Criteria.

This exam consists of  a  minimum  of  30  questions  derived  from  all  applicable  missile  or  weapon  directives specific  to  the  individual’s  weapon  qualification  (e.g.,  pilots  on jettison  and  weight  and balance, DSNs on Offensive Avionics System [OAS] faults and jettison procedures).  (T-AFI11-2B-52V2  18 MARCH 2015   7  2).  The  weapons exam  may be included in  the  Qualification Examination, but  must be annotated as a separate ground event on the AF Form 8. (T-2). 1.5.3.  Instrument Examination.  This examination is part of the pilot instrument evaluation, and  will  consist  of  at  least  50  questions  drawn  from  the  Instrument  Examination  SQB published by the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA).  (T-2). 1.6.  Instructor Evaluations. 1.6.1.  An instructor receiving an area grade of U or Q- with additional training in any graded area,  must  not  perform  instructor  duties  until  additional  training  is  complete.    (T-2).    This restriction  will  be  placed  in  the  comments  section,  and  the  YES  block  will  be  marked  in restrictions.  (T-2).  If these grades are assigned in any instructor area, the overall grade will be 3 for the instructor portion.  (T-2). 1.6.2.  Complete all upgrade training requirements prior to this evaluation. 1.6.3.  Only  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU)  instructors  may  receive  evaluations  with  an  FTU student in the pilot, copilot, radar navigator, navigator or electronic warfare officer positions.  For FTU Instructor Electronic Warfare Officers (IE), this can fulfill the instructor portion of the checkride only.   8  AFI11-2B-52V2  18 MARCH 2015 Chapter 2 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  General. 2.1.1.  All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202, Volume 2.  (T-2). 2.1.2.  Flight  phase  requirements  for  all  evaluations  are  shown  in  Tables  2.1-2.3.    When conditions  such  as  equipment  malfunction,  operational  requirements,  or  weather,  preclude evaluation  of  a  particular  event  in-flight,  it  may  be  evaluated  by  an  alternate  method  (e.g., ATD,  Cockpit  Procedures  Trainer  [CPT],  or  verbal  evaluation)  in  order  to  complete  the evaluation.  Document the reason and type of alternate method used in the Comments portion of  the  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification.    If  the  FE  determines  the  required item  cannot  be  adequately  evaluated  by  an  alternate  method,  the  examinee  will  require  an additional flight to complete the evaluation.  (T-2).  ATDs will only be used for areas that are certified in AFI 11-2B-52V1, B-52 Aircrew Training, or the Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum.    (T-2).    Progress  check  sortie  items  may  be  used  at  the  discretion  of  the evaluator to finish incomplete student FTU evaluations when an ATD or verbal completion is not  appropriate.    Specific  procedures  will  be  included  in  the  unit  supplement  to  AFI  11-202V2.  (T-2). 2.1.3.  For  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)  aircrew  to  complete  an  evaluation,  all  areas annotated with an “R” must be accomplished. (T-2).  Basic Mission Capable (BMC) aircrew will be evaluated in only those areas in which they maintain qualification.  (T-2).  Strive to complete all evaluation requirements on one flight for efficiency. 2.1.4.  Weapons  Qualification.    (N/A  AFMC).    All  weapons  qualified  crewmembers  will perform  a  Weapons  Preflight  and  take  a  Weapons  Open  Book  and  Weapons  Closed  Book Examination that reflects the knowledge used in each crew position to employ weapons.  (T-2).    Weapons  qualified  crewmembers  will  accomplish  a  Nuclear  and/or  Conventional Weapons Preflight IAW paragraph 2.2.7, Weapons Preflight. (T-2). 2.1.5.  Dual Seat Qualification.  The following guidance clarifies how dual seat qualifications are earned and retained. 2.1.5.1.  DSN  Evaluations.    DSNs  will  demonstrate  duties  applicable  to  the  RN  and  N positions.    (T-2).    The  examinee  may  be  evaluated  in  the  opposite  seat  in  the  ATD  if these  duties  are  not  demonstrated  in  flight.  Most  evaluation  areas  can  be  evaluated  in either seat.  As a minimum, DSNs will be evaluated in both seats in the following areas: (T-2). 2.1.5.1.1.  Area 7.  CRUISE/NAVIGATION. 2.1.5.1.2.  Area 10.  EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS. 2.1.5.1.3.  Area 12.  CREW COORDINATION. 2.1.5.1.4.  Area 13. AIR REFUELING. 2.1.5.1.5.  Area 21.  KNOWLEDGE. 2.1.5.1.6.  Area 48.  WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT. AFI11-2B-52V2  18 MARCH 2015   9  2.1.5.2.  Dual Seat Pilot Evaluations. 2.1.5.2.1.  Initial Dual Seat Pilot Evaluations.  Non-instructor pilots, who are current and qualified in the right seat, may become dual seat qualified on their initial left seat checkride if they demonstrate an instrument approach (2.1 or 34) to a touch-and-go in the  right  seat.    If  the  evaluation  is  completed  without  meeting  this  requirement,  the examinee  will  only  be  qualified  in  the  left  seat  until  an  instrument  approach  to  a touch-and-go is successfully evaluated in the right seat.  (T-2).  If an examinee gains dual seat qualification during a SPOT evaluation, that qualification will only be valid until  the  end  of  the  examinee’s  current  Instrument  (INSTM)/  Qualification  (QUAL) evaluation, regardless of when the SPOT evaluation was administered.  (T-2). 2.1.5.2.2.  Recurring  Dual  Seat  Pilot  Evaluations.    During  recurring  dual  seat  pilot evaluations,  the  examinee  may  fly  the  evaluation  in  either  seat  and  perform  an instrument  approach  (area  33  or  34)  to  a  touch-and-go  in  the  opposite  seat.    If  an examinee  gains  or  regains  dual  seat  qualification  during  a  SPOT  evaluation,  that evaluation will only be valid until the end of the examinee’s current  INSTM/QUAL evaluation, regardless of when the SPOT evaluation was administered.  (T-2). 2.1.6.  Preplanned  Mission  Data.    When  using  a  staff  agency-derived  flight  plan,  fuel  log, etc., do not grade the examinee for those portions computed by the staff.  Initial data input is the  responsibility  of  the  individual  developing  the  mission  planning  products.    (T-2).  However, the examinee is responsible to ensure the data used in the aircraft is accurate and effective for mission accomplishment. (T-2) 2.1.7.  Currency  of  Flight  Publications.    On  flight  evaluations,  all  issued  technical  orders, checklists, and publications required for the flight will be checked for currency and accuracy.  (T-2).    When  unit-maintained  publications  are  used  in-flight,  the  examinee  will  ensure currency and suitability for flight.  (T-2).  The unit supplement to AFI 11-202V2 may specify additional publications to be checked. 2.1.7.1.  Electronic Flight Bags (EFB).  The examinee is responsible for the currency of all publications, technical  orders, checklists and  FLIP (if  applicable) required for  flight. (T-2).  Examinees are required to ensure that the EFB is configured IAW the current EFB Concept of Employment (CONEMP).  (T-2) 2.2.  Instrument/Qualification  or  Qualification  Evaluation.  A  mission  flown  according  to instrument  flight  rules  best  fulfills  the  objective  of  the  INSTM/QUAL  evaluation.    This evaluation may be administered on any compatible training mission. 2.3.  Mission  Evaluation.  MSN evaluation will be flown IAW current tactics, unit tasking and theater  Area  of  Responsibility  scenarios  and  will  incorporate  all  appropriate  evaluation requirements from Table  2.1-  2.3. (T-2).  Scenarios that represent unit DOC tasking or current Air  and  Space  Expeditionary  Force  (AEF)  requirements  satisfy  the  requirements  of  this evaluation.  Provide the employment scenario IAW AFI 11-415, Weapons and Tactics Program, Attachment  3,  and  include  (as  a  minimum):  intelligence  scenario,  orders  of  battle  (electronic and  air),  commander’s  intent,  strike  mission  objectives  and  Special  Instructions  (SPINS).    The scenario portion of the flight need not encompass the entire sortie, but must include at least one weapon  event.    (T-2).    When  SPINS  are  not  available  or  used,  use  command  guidance  from appropriate instructions. (T-2).  Evaluations during exercises or deployments are not prohibited;   10  AFI11-2B-52V2  18 MARCH 2015 however,  units  should  apply  operational  risk  management  principles  to  the  scheduling  of  the evaluation.  Real world contingencies may provide a unique opportunity to conduct evaluations; however,  factors  beyond  the  control  of  the  examinee  and  FE  may  preclude  its  successful completion. 2.3.1.  Minimum ground phase requisites are: 2.3.1.1.  EPE (if MSN evaluation is stand-alone evaluation. See Chapter 4). (T-2) 2.3.1.2.  Open  Book  and  Closed  Book  weapons  examination  (Weapons  Qualified Crewmembers). (T-2) 2.3.1.3.  Weapons Preflight (Weapons Qualified Crewmembers). (T-2) 2.3.1.3.1.  Crewmembers who are nuclear Combat Mission Ready (CMR-N), nuclear Basic Mission Capable (BMC-N), or in  training to  become CMR-N or BMC-N will perform  a  preflight  of  an  inert/training  nuclear  weapon  or  War  Reserve  (WR)  asset and  a  conventional  weapon.    (T-2).    This  includes  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU) instructors who instruct nuclear weapons employment.  All others will accomplish a conventional  weapon  preflight.    (T-2).    Document  weapons  preflight  in  the  ground phase  section  of  the  AF  Form  8  as  Nuclear  Weapons  Preflight  or  Conventional Weapons Preflight with the associated grade of 1 or 3. 2.3.1.4.  ATD  Evaluation.    (E)    Accomplish  the  ATD  evaluation  for  all  mission evaluations and annotate the date and grade (1, 2, or 3) in the ground phase section of the AF  Form  8.    An  examinee  receiving  a  grade  of  3  (unqualified)  will  be  placed  on supervised status IAW AFI11-202v2 paragraph 5.7.  (T-2). 2.3.1.4.1.  The  ATD  evaluation  will  cover  all  areas  annotated  with  “R”  under  the ATD  column  in  Table  2.3.  (T-2).    The  exercise  must  include,  but  is  not  limited  to, analyzing one system malfunction, a fighter attack (forward and/or rear hemisphere), and the penetration of high and/or low altitude threat areas according to the mission scenario.   (T-2).   The exercise should have appropriate types and density  of threats, which  accurately  reflect  a  typical  unit  OPLAN.    The  examinee’s  EPE  may  be accomplished  concurrently  in  this  ATD  mission. Each  unit  will  have  a  minimum  of two  different  check  missions.  (T-2).    Unit  stan/eval  will  ensure  that  all  threats  and threat  modes  presented  in  check  missions  are  represented  in  continuation  training ATD missions.  (T-2). 2.3.2.  Air  Refueling.    The  evaluation  will  include  the  following  areas  applicable  to  the examinee’s crew position: air refueling communication, air refueling rendezvous (any type) with a tanker aircraft, aircraft control, descent, contact, fuel management and transfer, visual signals  (may  be  done  verbally  if  necessary),  post  refueling,  and  breakaway.    (T-2).    At  the discretion  of  the  assigned/attached  flying  squadron  commander,  copilots  may  qualify  in  air refueling procedures during any in-flight (initial, recurring, or SPOT) evaluation by meeting the  provisions  of  paragraph  2.3.2.2  below.    If  a  copilot  gains  air  refueling  qualification during a SPOT evaluation, the qualification will only be valid until the end of the examinee’s current  MSN  evaluation,  regardless  of  when  the  SPOT  evaluation  was  administered.  (T-2).  Air refueling tracks will allow at least 30 minutes of air refueling per pilot, and 15 minutes per  copilot  (if  applicable).    (T-2).    Deviations  from  this  requirement  are  permissible  only when  tanker/bomber  formation  ratio  or  length  of  the  published  air  refueling  track  prohibits AFI11-2B-52V2  18 MARCH 2015   11  compliance.    However,  each  examinee  must  have  sufficient  time  to  meet  requirements  in 2.3.2.1  and  2.3.2.2  below.    (T-2).    Air  refueling  practice  emergency  separation  procedures must  be  initiated  with  the  receiver  in  contact  or  in  the  refueling  envelope.    (T-2).    Grade buddy rendezvous procedures using the formation criteria.  (T-2). 2.3.2.1.  (P)  .  Ten minutes of contact time for recurring and 20 minutes of contact time for  initial  qualification  evaluations  must  be  completed  within  30  minutes  after  initial astern/pre-contact position.  (T-2) 2.3.2.2.  (CP)  Five  minutes  of  contact  time  must  be  completed  within  15  minutes  after initial astern/pre-contact position (if applicable).  (T-2). 2.3.3.  Terrain  Avoidance  (TA).    (If  applicable)  (P/CP/DSN)    Requirements  include  a  TA Functional check, at least 10 minutes terrain avoidance with an operational TA system, and at least  10  minutes  terrain  avoidance  utilizing  integrated  Electro-Optical  Viewing  System (EVS)/visual contour procedures.  (T-2).  Conduct TA in mountainous routes when possible. 2.3.4.  Weapons Employment Requirements. 2.3.4.1.  Weapons employment classes are defined as: unguided (e.g. GP, B-61, or B-83, etc.)  and  guided  (e.g.,  JDAM,  WCMD,  LGB,  ALCM,  CALCM,  MALD  and  JASSM).  Units  will  design  written  mission  evaluation  profiles  using  current  tactics,  unit  tasking and  theater  Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR)  scenarios  and  will  incorporate  all  evaluation requirements. (T-2).  Scenarios that represent unit DOC tasking satisfy the requirements of  this  evaluation.    Design  profiles  to  evaluate  training,  flight  position,  special qualifications, and basic airmanship.  Initial mission evaluations should be given IAW the applicable FTU syllabus. 2.3.4.2.  Aircrew  should  demonstrate  proficiency  in  both  guided  and  unguided  weapons employment; however, only one is required to complete an evaluation.  (T-2) 2.3.4.2.1.  Guided  conventional  or  nuclear  weapon  employment  consists  of  direct  or indirect  engagement  scenarios  using  weapons  such  as  JDAM,  WCMD,  LGB, CALCM, MALD, JASSM, or ALCM.  Direct engagement scenarios typically involve man-in-the-loop decisions and limited standoff range.  Indirect engagement scenarios typically involve autonomous systems and increased standoff range.  Either direct or indirect guided weapons employment is acceptable. 2.3.4.2.2.  Unguided  weapons  employment  consists  of  conventional  or  nuclear scenarios using weapons such as GP, B-61, or B-83. 2.3.4.3.  Conditions  permitting,  use  Emission  Control  (EMCON)  procedures  and techniques  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  and  use  threat  avoidance/evasive  action techniques as directed by the employment scenario. 2.3.4.4.  Grade each release of unguided gravity weapons separately.  Any type of scoring is acceptable, however, for actual weapons deliveries, range scoring is preferred. 2.3.4.5.  For  TA  qualified  crewmembers,  an  unguided  gravity  release  should  be accomplished at TA altitudes. 2.3.4.5.1.  (DSN)  .    When  weather  or  equipment  malfunctions  preclude  bombing  at TA  altitude,  configure  the  radar  scope  in  TA  sector  (except  when  optimum   12  AFI11-2B-52V2  18 MARCH 2015 presentation requires another setting), use TA procedures, and accomplish the run at minimum  safe  altitude/instrument  flight  rules  altitude.    If  equipment  malfunctions preclude  synchronous  capability,  alternate  bombing  meets  the  requirements  of  the evaluation. 2.3.5.  Electronic Countermeasures Requirements (E).  The examinee will accomplish at least one  electronic  attack  (EA)  run.  (T-2).    To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  the  run  should  be scheduled  against  a  Multiple  Threat  Emissions  Systems  (MUTES)  capable  site.    The  flight examiner  may,  during  mission  planning  for  mission  evaluations,  select  another  MUTES scenario  that  reflects  the  unit  DOC  tasking  or  AOR.    For  no-notice  evaluations,  scheduled scenario(s) may be changed by the examinee to a Sierra, Tango, or Mike scenario. 2.3.5.1.  Flight examiners will not consider EW performance as less than qualified based solely on unreliable/substandard scores.  (T-2). 2.4.  Formal  Course  Evaluation.  Aircrew  evaluations  conducted  as  part  of  a  formal  FTU training syllabus will be flown IAW AFI 11-202V2 and Table 2.1 of this document.  (T-2). 2.5.  I nstructor Evaluation. 2.5.1.  All flying personnel selected for instructor duty must be evaluated to determine their judgment,  technical  knowledge,  instructor  ability  (including  error  analysis  of  student activity), and use of grading documents as well as proficiency in their aircrew specialty.  (T-2).    All  evaluation  areas  will  be  evaluated  during  all  instructor  evaluations.  (T-2).    Initial instructor  evaluations  may  be  accomplished  in  conjunction  with  INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluations. 2.5.2.  Instructors  must  demonstrate  proficiency  by  instructing  a  student  or  qualified individual  acting  as  a  student.    (T-2).    The  evaluator  may  require  the  examinee  to  present verbal  explanations  of  equipment  operations,  procedures,  and  techniques  pertinent  to  crew specialty duties and responsibilities. 2.5.3.  Initial Flight evaluation.  To initially qualify as an instructor, flying personnel selected for instructor duty must successfully complete an initial instructor evaluation.  (T-2).  This is a  one-time  evaluation  in  which  the  examinee  must  demonstrate  ability  to  instruct  in  some phase  of  the  unit’s  mission.  (T-2).    Except  for  requirements  delineated  in  Chapter  3,  Area 25, Instructor  Performance, specific profiles  and/or events  will be determined by the flight examiner.  (T-2). 2.5.4.  Subsequent  aircrew  evaluations  (i.e.  INSTM/QUAL/MSN)  will  include  instructor portions during the evaluations.  (T-2). 2.5.5.  Instructor  Pilot  Requirements.    Instructor  Pilots  who  were  not  previously  dual  seat qualified  will  occupy  the  right  seat  during  their  initial  instructor  evaluation  for  takeoff,  air refueling, initial buffet, and all traffic pattern activity.  (T-2).  Previously qualified dual seat pilots may occupy either seat for their initial instructor evaluation for the events listed above.  Instructor pilots must demonstrate the ability to instruct in mission accomplishment as well as flying the aircraft as described below. (T-2). 2.5.5.1.  Initial  buffet  and  recovery  demonstration  in-flight.    For  recurring  evaluations, this event may be accomplished in the ATD as part of the EPE. AFI11-2B-52V2  18 MARCH 2015   13  2.5.5.2.  Air refueling boom envelope limit demonstration.  Contact time may be reduced to  5  minutes  excluding  the  time  required  to  demonstrate  boom  envelope  limits.  Inadvertent  disconnect  tolerances  are  not  applicable  during  demonstration  of  boom envelope limits.  On recurring evaluations, the boom limit demonstration is desired, but may be waived at the discretion of the evaluator. 2.5.5.3.  Accomplish EP patterns as directed in paragraph 2.2.2. 2.5.6.  Instructor DSN Requirements.  Instructor evaluations may be conducted in-flight or in the ATD.  The examinee will thoroughly brief, conduct, and critique a profile representative of the unit’s DOC.  (T-2). 2.5.6.1.  Documentation  of  Initial  or  Requalification  Instructor  DSN  Evaluation.    If  the evaluation  is  conducted  in  the  ATD,  enter  the  Instructor  ATD,  date  and  grade  (1  or  3) under the ground phase side of the AF Form 8.  If the instructor portion is accomplished inflight, enter the Instructor evaluation, date and grade (1 or 3) under the flight phase side of the AF Form 8. 2.5.7.  Instructor  Electronic  Warfare  Officer  Requirements.    Instructor  evaluations  will  be accomplished in the ATD, except as outlined in paragraph 1.6.4.  (T-2).  Use unit-specific missions to evaluate the instructor (except FTU instructors).  Enter Instructor ATD, date, and grade (1 or 3) under the ground phase on the AF Form 8.   On all instructor evaluations the student will not be evaluated. (T-2). 2.6.  Reporting  Deviations/Discrepancies  by  Unlike  Specialty.  Evaluators  must  report deviations/discrepancies within their aircraft from established procedures/directives in any area, regardless  of  the  individual’s  crew  specialty,  to  the  Operations  Group  Standardization/ Evaluation  (OGV)  for  evaluation  and  necessary  action.    (T-2).    If  the  deviation/discrepancy  is found to warrant overall Qualification Level 3 AF Form 8 documentation, annotate SPOT in the Flight Phase block.  The Chief of OGV will sign as the flight examiner.  (T-2). 2.6.1.  For formation purposes, evaluators of like or unlike specialty in other aircraft within the formation who observe deviations/discrepancies affecting the overall safe conduct of the formation  will  report  such  deviation/discrepancy  to  OGV  for  evaluation  and  necessary action.  (T-2) .  If AF Form 8 documentation is warranted, use the procedures in paragraph 2.6. 2.7.  Crew  Compartment  Spot  Evaluations.  When  an  individual  in  a  crew  compartment  is receiving  an  evaluation,  the  other  compartment  individual  will  (if  qualified)  receive  a  SPOT evaluation.  (T-2).    Only  annotate  SPOT  when  the  evaluation  does  not  update  the  individual’s expiration date. Individuals that wish to realign based upon a SPOT evaluation must declare their intent  on  mission  planning  day  or  prior  to  stepping  to  the  aircraft  for  a  no-notice  SPOT evaluation.  Annotate the type of evaluation given (i.e., INSTM/QUAL/MSN not SPOT) in the Flight Phase.  (T-2). Table 2.1.  Pilot Evaluations.
