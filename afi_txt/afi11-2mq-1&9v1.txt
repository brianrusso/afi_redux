Process  changes  using  the  AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for Change  of  Publication,  IAW  AFI  33-360,  and  AFI  11-215,  USAF  Flight  Manuals  Program (FMP),  through  local  and  MAJCOM  training  channels  to  ACC/A3MU.    ACC/A3MU  will forward coordinated recommended changes to USAF/A3OI for approval.  Handle time-sensitive changes by immediate-action message. 1.4.  Qualification Training.  Aircrew training is designed to progress a pilot or sensor operator from  Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT)  or  Requalification  and  Transition  (TX)  to  Mission Qualification  Training  (MQT),  and  finally  to  Continuation  Training  (CT)  through  the  normal training cycle.  The following is an overview of qualification training:   8  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 1.4.1.  IQT  and  TX.  IQT  and  TX  provide  aircrew  members  the  training  necessary  to initially  qualify  in  a  basic  aircraft  position  and  flying  duties  without  regard  to  any  specific unit's  mission.   See  Chapter  2.    Upon  completion  of  IQT  or  TX,  the  aircrew  member  will arrive at their gaining unit with Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. 1.4.1.1.  BAQ is a prerequisite for all follow-on training, including MQT. 1.4.1.2.  Except for general officers, BAQ is not a long-term qualification status.  Waiver authority  to  remain  BAQ  for  longer  than  six  months  is  MAJCOM/A3  (NGB/A3Y, AFRC/A3T). (T-2). 1.4.2.  Mission  Qualification  Training.  MQT  provides  aircrew  members  the  advanced training necessary to qualify in an assigned aircrew position to perform the missions assigned to  a  specific  unit.    See  Chapter  3.    Aircrew  will  maintain  BAQ  status  until  completion  of MQT  and  subsequently  designated  CMR/BMC.    Completion  of  MQT  is  a  prerequisite  for CMR/BMC. The FTU instructor course is equivalent to a unit MQT program. 1.4.3.  Continuation  Training.  CT  provides  aircrew  members  the  training  necessary  to maintain  flying  proficiency  and  consists  of  basic  flying  skills  to  safely  operate  the  aircraft and mission-related skills to accomplish the unit’s assigned mission.  See Chapter 4. 1.4.4.  -(ACC/ACC-Gained only) RAP.  RAP is the ACC CT program designed to focus on capabilities  needed  to  accomplish  a  unit's  primary  DOC  statement  missions.    Following completion of MQT, units will assign aircrew members to either a CMR position or a BMC position.  (T-2). CMR aircrew maintain combat readiness, while BMC aircrew may require additional  training  prior  to  combat.    As  Lead  Command,  ACC  will  publish  a  RTM  to establish CT requirements. Post the current RTM following this instruction. 1.4.4.1.  CMR.  CMR establishes the minimum training required for aircrew members to qualify  and  remain  proficient  in  all  of  the  primary  DOC  statement  missions  tasked  to their assigned or attached unit and weapon system.  Designate and maintain CMR aircrew as follows: 1.4.4.1.1.  All  designated  combat  aircraft  (CC-coded)  unit  active  duty  API-1, Squadron  Commander  (SQ/CC),  and  Squadron  Director  of  Operations  (SQ/DO) positions  are  designated  as  CMR  positions.    OG/CCs  may  designate  other  API-6 positions  not  assigned  to  the  flying  squadron  as  CMR.    EXCEPTION:  If  a  unit  is over-manned,  the  SQ/CC  may  elect  to  train  the  front  line  of  their  Unit  Manning Document  (UMD)  API-1s  to  CMR  and  designate  the  overage  BMC.    In  this  case, priority should be given to inexperienced aircrew members with at least 50 percent, if available, designated CMR.  (ARC: any aircrew member may be designated CMR or BMC at OG/CC discretion). 1.4.4.1.2.  CMR  aircrew  maintain  proficiency  and  qualification  in  all  primary missions of the flying unit to which they are assigned/attached.  Failure to complete CMR  training  or  maintain  designated  currencies  results  in  regression  to  non-CMR (N-CMR)  status  unless  waived  by  appropriate  authority.  (T-2).  While  N-CMR, aircrew may perform missions (including exercises and contingencies) and events in which they are current and qualified at the discretion of the SQ/CC. AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   9  1.4.4.2.  BMC.  BMC  establishes  the  minimum  training  required  for  aircrew  to  be familiar  with  all  (possibly  qualified  and  proficient  in  some)  of  the  primary  DOC statement  mission  requirements  of  their  assigned  or  attached  unit  and  weapons  system.  Designate and maintain BMC as follows: 1.4.4.2.1.  Active duty non-CMR aircrew positions above squadron level are normally designated BMC.  BMC designations are assigned to aircrew that have a primary job performing  wing  supervision  or  staff  functions  that  directly  support  the  flying operation. 1.4.4.2.2.  BMC  aircrew  maintain  FAM  with  all  unit  primary  missions.    They  may also  train  for  proficiency  and  qualification  in  some  of  those  missions.    For  those missions  in  which  they  maintain  FAM  only,  BMC  aircrew  must  be  able  to  attain proficiency  and  qualification  in  30  days  or  less.    BMC  aircrew  must  accomplish  all mission-related ground training designated by their attached SQ/CC. (T-3). 1.4.4.2.3.  BMC aircrew may deploy and participate in any mission as determined by the SQ/CC IAW paragraph 1.7.6  Failure to complete BMC required training results in  regression  to  non-BMC  (N-BMC)  status.    While  N-BMC,  SQ/CC  will  determine missions aircrew may perform and supervision level required. 1.4.4.3.  N-CMR/N-BMC.  Aircrew status  must accomplish  the  requirements  in  accordance  with  paragraph  4.6  before  regaining CMR/BMC status (as applicable). to  N-CMR/N-BMC regressing 1.4.4.4.  Specialized  Training.  Specialized training is  training in  any special skills  that are  not  required  by  every  aircrew  member,  but  are  necessary  to  carry  out  the  unit's assigned  missions.    Specialized  training  is  normally  accomplished  after  an  aircrew member is assigned CMR/BMC status.  Unless otherwise specified in this AFI, aircrew in CMR  or  BMC  positions  may  hold  special  capabilities/qualifications  as  long  as  any additional training requirements are accomplished. 1.5.  Training Concepts and Policies (T-2): 1.5.1.  Units  will  design  training  programs  to  achieve  the  highest  degree  of  readiness consistent  with  flight  safety  and  resource  availability.    Training  must  balance  the  need  for realism against the expected threat, aircrew capabilities, and safety.  This instruction provides training  guidelines  and  policies  for  use  with  operational  procedures  specified  in  applicable flying/operations publications. 1.5.2.  ACC Training Support Squadron (TRSS) will develop and validate training programs when tasked by HQ ACC/A3.  Other MAJCOMS may submit requests for training program support  to  the  HQ  ACC/A3.    If  validated,  these  requests  will  be  prioritized  and  tasked  to ACC  TRSS.    Designated  test  units  (CB-coded)  may  develop  syllabi  to  upgrade  operational test aircrew in support of specific test plans.  These syllabi will be approved by the Test and Evaluation Group (TEG) commander and submitted to ACC TRSS. 1.5.3.  In-flight Supervision: Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision necessary to accomplish the required training.  If the mission objectives include introduction to new tasks, or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an instructor pilot (IP) or instructor sensor operator (ISO) is required.   10  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 1.6.

Aircrew  require  a  minimum  number  of  flight  hours  to  be  considered  experienced (EXP)  in  the  aircraft  IAW  AFI  11-412,  “Aircrew  Management”.    Inexperienced  (INEXP) aircrew must train at a higher rate to maintain currencies and proficiencies.  Training tables in this volume and the RTM (or MAJCOM-specific guidance) define requirements for both EXP and INEXP levels. 1.6.2.  An experienced MCE aircrew member must meet one of the following criteria: 1.6.2.1.  550 hours Primary Aerospace Vehicle Inventory (PAI), or 1.6.2.2.  550 total hours of which 300 hours are PAI, or 1.6.2.3.  550 MQ-1/9 hours of which 150 are PAI. 1.6.3.  To  be  considered  experienced  in  L/R  operations,  aircrew  must  meet  the  following criteria: accrue 75 hours of L/R flight time and be L/R qualified for 6 months. 1.6.4.  Pilot  hours  are  defined  as  Primary/Secondary/Instructor  /Evaluator  time.    Time  does not  include  other  time,  non-pilot  time  (e.g.  NAV)  or  hours  logged  at  Undergraduate  RPA Training (SUPT),  Specialized Undergraduate  Navigator  Training  (SUNT),  or  Primary  Undergraduate  Combat  Systems Officer Training (UCT). (URT),  Specialized  Undergraduate  Pilot  Training in logged 1.6.5.  Hours the  Predator  Mission  Aircrew  Training  System  (PMATS) accomplishing  RTM-approved  missions  may  be  counted  as  hours  when  determining  MCE experience level.  RAP PMATS hours will not exceed 50% of the total required to meet the experience threshold (e.g., 150 RAP PMATS mission hours out of 300 PAI). 1.6.6.  Experience  Grandfather  Clause.  Effective  publication  date  of  this  AFI,  any currently  designated  experienced  aircrew  (both  MCE  and  L/R)  are  grandfathered “experienced.” 1.7.  RAP Policy and Management (ACC/ACC-gained units only) (T-2): 1.7.1.  RAP  is  the  continuation  training  (CT)  program  designed  to  focus  training  on capabilities  needed  to  accomplish  a  unit’s  basic  tasked  missions.  RAP  tasking  is  executed IAW  the  MQ-1/9  RAP  Tasking  Memorandum  (RTM).  Each  RAP  qualification  level  is defined  by  a  total  number  of  RAP  sorties,  broken  down  into  mission  types  and  associated events as determined by the MAJCOM and unit commanders. Aircrew members will receive training in all MDS aircraft they are qualified in and will be assigned to either a CMR or a BMC  position  in  the  unit.  The  standard  sortie  requirements  in  the  RTM  establish  the minimum number of RAP sorties per training cycle for BMC and CMR levels of training. 1.7.2.  The  aircrew  training  cycle  is  12  months  coincident  with  the  fiscal  year.  Units  will complete  training  requirements  during  the  appropriate  training  cycle.  Training  shortfalls during this period will be reported IAW paragraph 1.2 1.7.3.  The SQ/CC’s first priority should be to train all designated aircrew to CMR. 1.7.4.  Progression from BMC to CMR status requires: 1.7.4.1.  A 1-month look-back at the CMR mission rate. AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   11  1.7.4.2.  Qualification in all primary missions and weapons events required at CMR. 1.7.4.3.  Confirmation  that  the  progressed  aircrew  member  can  complete  the  prorated number of sortie/event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle. 1.7.4.4.  Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification (see paragraph 3.2.2 for Initial Verification. 1.7.4.5.  SQ/CC certification. 1.7.5.  Special  Capabilities  or  Qualifications.  SQ/CCs  will  determine  which  aircrew  will train  for  and  maintain  special  capabilities  or  qualifications.    RAP  training  requirements  for special capabilities are accomplished in addition to baseline CMR/BMC requirements. 1.7.6.  Wing CMR/BMC aircrew will fly the required monthly lookback rate. If unable, refer to regression, paragraph 4.7 1.7.7.  End  of  Cycle  training  requirements  are  based  on  the  aircrew  experience  level  and qualifications on the last day of the current training cycle. 1.7.8.  Units  converting  to  another  Mission  Design  Series  (MDS)  may  fly  aircrew  in  CMR positions  at  the  BMC  rate  until  one  month  prior  to  the  operationally  ready  date  if  CMR mission  rates  cannot  be  supported.    CMR  aircrew  should  be  flown  at  a  CMR  rate  for  the month  prior  to  initial  operational  capability  (IOC).    Active  duty  wings  converting  to  new MDS  are  authorized  one  SQ-equivalent  of  additional  API-6s  during  the  conversion  period.  However,  total  wing  staff  flying  the  new  aircraft  shall  not  exceed  total  authorized  for  final conversion equipage. 1.8.  RAP Training Mission Program Development (ACC/ACC-Gained only) (T-2): 1.8.1.  RAP  mission  and  event  requirements  (see  Attachment  2  for  definitions)  apply  to CMR  and  BMC  aircrew  as  well  as  those  individuals  carrying  special  capabilities  or qualifications  and  are  IAW  the  RTM.    The  RTM  establishes  the  minimum  number  of required  missions  and  events  per  training  cycle  for  CMR/BMC  levels  of  training.        The current  RTM takes precedence over the RAP  requirements in  this volume and may  contain updated requirements and events not yet incorporated in Attachment 2. 1.8.2.  Experience  building  and  collateral  sortie  requirements  must  be  considered  when developing RAP training and unit flying hour programs. 1.8.2.1.  Experience  building  sorties  are  additional  training  sorties  necessary  to  achieve desired proficiency in optimum time.  RAP missions may not provide sufficient hours to experience aircrew to achieve overall unit experience levels.  Paragraph 1.6 provides the definition for an experienced aircrew. 1.8.2.2.  Collateral sorties are not directly related to combat employment training but are necessary in day-to-day squadron operations. 1.8.3.  MAJCOMs may augment unit flying hour programs with a number of attrition sorties that compensate for non-effective training missions.  Pilots may log any training mission as non-effective  when  a  major  portion  of  valid  training  for  that  type  of  mission  cannot  be accomplished due to poor weather, air aborts, or other unexpected circumstances.  In order to allocate the number of attrition sorties accurately, it is essential that pilots log non-effective sorties appropriately.   12  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 1.9.  Training Records and Reports: 1.9.1.  Units will maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations IAW:  (T-3). 1.9.1.1.  AFI 11-202V1 & AFI 11-202V2. 1.9.1.2.  AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. 1.9.1.3.  ACC  Instruction  11-464,  Training  Records  and  Performance  Evaluation  in Formal Flying Training Programs. 1.9.2.  Units will track the following information for all aircrew (as applicable): (T-3). 1.9.2.1.  Ground training. 1.9.2.2.  Requirements  and  accomplishment  of  individual  sorties,  MAJCOM-specific sorties and missions types, and events cumulatively for the training cycle. 1.9.2.3.  Look-back  (N/A  AFSOC):    MAJCOM-specific  mission  requirements  using  1-month and 3-month running totals for look-back. 1.9.2.4.  Requirements and accomplishment of individual currencies. 1.9.2.5.  Weapons  employment  records  in  sufficient  detail  to  document  all  employment attempts and hit percentages in any appropriate database. 1.9.3.  Units may update ARMS training tasks with “No Date” with either the date of the last FTU or USAFWS-equivalent training accomplished, or the unit mission certification date. 1.10.  Mission and Armament Recording. 1.10.1.  Aircrew should use and assess all available training documentation,  such as Digital Video/Audio  Recording  devices  (DVR),  on  all  missions.    Individual  aircrew  should  review applicable portions of mission tapes to enhance training. 1.10.2.  As  a  guide,  the  following  items  should  be  reviewed  after  every  mission:  crew coordination, weapons parameters, accuracy, identification procedures, adherence to training rules, communications procedures and discipline, flight discipline, and tactical employment. 1.11.  Aircrew Utilization Policy:  (T-3) 1.11.1.  Commanders will ensure wing/group aircrew (API-1/6) fill authorized positions IAW UMDs  and  that  aircrew  member  status  is  properly  designated.    The  overall  objective  is  for aircrew  to  perform  combat-related  duties.    Supervisors  may  assign  aircrew  to  valid,  short-term  tasks  (e.g.,  escort  officer,  flight  evaluation  board/mishap  board  member),  but  must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level  of  aircrew tasking,  flying proficiency, currency, and experience. 1.11.2.  While  API-1-assigned  wing  aircrew  may  perform  additional  duties  outside  of  their flying squadron for a temporary basis, their primary responsibility is with the squadron to fill DOC  statement  tasked  missions.   Wing  leadership  will  not  prioritize  workload  unrelated  to squadron mission requirements for the employment of squadron API-1 aircrew. 1.11.3.  Commanders  will  ensure  API-6  pilots  on  the  wing  staff  perform  duties  justified  in MAJCOM  manpower  standards  documents  and  authorized  in  UMDs.  AFRC:  OG/CC  may designate API positions as required to meet unit requirements AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   13  1.12.  Sortie  Allocation  and  Unit  Manning  Guidance:  Note:  Sortie  allocation  guidance applies to training sortie/missions, not contingency operations. 1.12.1.  Sortie  Allocation.  In  general,  inexperienced  API-1  aircrew  should  receive  sortie allocation priority over experienced aircrew.  Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows: 1.12.1.1.  Operational  (CC-Coded)  Units.  CMR  API-1,  MQT  API-1,  CMR  API-6, MQT API-6, and BMC. 1.12.1.2.  Formal  Training  and  USAFWS  (TF-Coded)  Units.  Formal  syllabus training,  Instructor  Upgrade  Training,  Instructor  CT,  authorized  staff  personnel  not performing Instructor or Flight Examiner (FE) duties. 1.12.1.3.  Test  and  Test  Evaluation  Squadron  (CB-coded)  Units.  Requirements directed by MAJCOM followed by training required to prepare for assigned projects and taskings. 1.12.2.  Wing API-6 authorizations are IAW UMDs. 1.12.3.  For  wings  consisting  of  both  TF-coded  and  CC-coded  units,  at  least  one  of  the following  aircrew  will  maintain  FTU  instructor  status  (when  possible):  Wing  Commander (WG/CC),  Wing  Vice  Commander  (WG/CV),  OG/CC,  or  OG/CD.    (T-2).  For  FTU-only wings,  all API-6  aircrew will maintain instructor status  (optional  for WG/CC and OG/CC). (T-2). FTU-only wings will fly  API-1/6  aircrew as required by programmed flying training (PFT). (T-2). 1.12.4.  Authorizations  for  API-8  aircrew,  ACC/Inspector  General  Inspections  (IGI) inspectors in API-6 billets, and CB-coded aircrew flying authorizations will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance. (T-2). 1.12.4.1.  API-8  and  ACC/IGI  aircrew  should  fly  the  BMC  rate;  API-8  and  ACC/IGI aircrew,  however,  are  not  required  to  complete  BMC-specific  missions  and  events  or meet monthly lookback requirements. 1.12.4.2.  CB-coded pilots should fly the BMC rate at a minimum.  Aircrew assigned or attached  to  ACC/IGI  as  API-6  will  maintain  RAP  currencies/lookback  per  API-8 guidance. (T-2). 1.12.5.  Maximum Sorties (N/A AFRC and ANG).  There is no maximum sortie count for CMR/BMC aircrew.  Table 1.1 provides guidelines for the minimum and maximum annual sortie allowance for non-API-1 aircrew.  On occasion, unique operations may require aircrew to  fly  more  than  the  maximum  number  of  sorties  authorized,  however,  this  may  impact training of other aircrew. 1.12.6.  Units  should  provide  assigned  API-6/8  flyers  adequate  resources  to  maintain minimum  training  requirements;  however,  support  for  API-6/8  aircrew  will  not  limit  the flying squadron's primary mission.  If units cannot meet attached aircrew requirements, they must  request  relief  IAW  AFI  11-401,  as  supplemented.    Units  requiring  flying  hour adjustments  for  attached  API-8  and  applicable  API-6  flyers  must  request  program  changes IAW MAJCOM directives.   14  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 Table 1.1.

Waiver Authority: 1.13.1.  MAJCOM/A3 may delegate waiver authority for the requirements of the RTM to the OG/CC.  Additional guidance may be provided in the RTM. 1.13.2.  Units subordinate to a Numbered Air Force (NAF) will forward requests directly to MAJCOM  Aircrew  Training  function  (ex:  ACC/A3M)  and  provide  their  NAF/A3/OV  with an information copy.  In all cases, once the waiver process is complete, include ACC/A3M as an information addressee. 1.13.3.  Waivers to this volume will be valid until the Approving Official cancels in writing, revises the publication, or the waiver expires. AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   15  Chapter 2 INITIAL QUALIFICATION, REQUALIFICATION, TRANSITION AND SENIOR OFFICER TRAINING 2.1.  General.  This chapter outlines training of crewmembers in MQ1/9 unit aircraft. (IQT),  Requalification  and 2.1.1.  Formal  Training.  Initial  Qualification  Training Transition  (TX),  and  Senior  Officer  training  will  normally  be  conducted  during  formal syllabus courses at the FTU.  Formal course graduates will be proficient in mission tasks as indicated by the Course Training Standards (CTS) and Required Proficiency Levels (RPL) of the FTU syllabi.  Graduates of IQT and TX are BAQ until completion of follow-on MQT. 2.1.2.  Local  Training.  In  exceptional  circumstances  when  FTU  training  is  not  available within  a  reasonable  time  period,  local  IQT,  TX,  and  Senior  Officer  training  may  be performed at the unit IAW the provisions of this chapter.  When local training is authorized, the gaining MAJCOM assumes responsibility for the burden of providing this training.  Once local  training  is  authorized,  the  OG/CC  becomes  the  delegated  approval  authority  for  entry into  local  training  in  accordance  with  guidelines  below.  Local  training  programs  will  be conducted  using  the  appropriate  formal  course  syllabus  track,  program  flow,  requirement, and  CTS/RPL.  (T-2).  Completion  of  formal  training  in  residence  or  via  secondary  method training  waiver  will  result  in  personnel  actions  IAW  AFI  36-2107  Active  Duty  Service Commitments (ADSC). (T-1). 2.1.3.  IQT completion requires a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and applicable MDS Volume  2.    Aircrew  will  not  be  evaluated  on  events  in  which  they  were  not  specifically trained or qualified (i.e., MCE aircrew not trained in L/R operations). (T-2). 2.2.  Approval/Waiver for Local IQT and Local Requalification Training: 2.2.1.  B-Course, TX-1, and TX-2.  Gaining MAJCOM/A3 (NGB/A3Y, AFRC/A3T) is the approval  authority  to  conduct  local  B-course,  TX-1,  and  TX-2,  and  is  waiver  authority  to change  the  formal  requirements  of  this  training.  Local  training  must  be  approved  on  an individual basis. (T-2). Inform ACC/A3M of approved waivers. 2.2.2.  TX-3  Transition.  Gaining  MAJCOM/A3  (NGB/A3Y,  AFRC/A3T)  is  the  approval authority  to  conduct  local  TX-3  for  aircrew  transitioning  from  the  MQ-1  to  the  MQ-9  and vice-versa,  and  is  the  waiver  authority  to  change  the  formal  requirements  of  this  training. Local  training  must  be  approved  on  an  individual  basis.  (T-2).    Inform  ACC/A3M  of approved waivers. 2.2.3.  TX-3 Requalification.  IAW AFI 11-202V1, SQ/CCs may direct local requalification training for aircrew unqualified up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment, or up to  51  months  at  the  end  of  any  active  flying  assignment.    Completion  of  the  FTU  TX-3 course satisfies this requirement. 2.2.4.  Requests  to  conduct  local  IQT  or  local  requalification  training  will  include  the following: (T-2). 2.2.4.1.  Justification for the local training in lieu of formal course training. 2.2.4.2.  Summary of individual’s flying experience.   16  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 2.2.4.3.  Date training will begin and expected completion date. 2.2.4.4.  Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, if any, with rationale. 2.3.  Prerequisites.  Course  prerequisites  are  IAW  AFI  11-202V1,  this  instruction,  the appropriate  formal  course  syllabus  and  Air  Force  Education  and  Training  Course Announcements  (ETCA)  (applicable  ACC  Syllabus  Course)  https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.  Individuals without all prerequisites met or waived may be denied entry into training. (T-2). 2.4.  Ground Training.  Ground training will be accomplished IAW the syllabus.  Use available and current reference materials such as Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP), instructor  guides,  and  audiovisual  programs  as  supporting  materials  to  the  maximum  extent possible.    Accomplish  simulator  missions  in  a  PMATS  to  the  maximum  extent  possible; however,  OG/CCs  can  authorize  a  Ground  Control  Station  (GCS)  or  another  Aircrew  Training Device (ATD) if a PMATS is not available. 2.5.  Flying Training: 2.5.1.  Mission  sequence  and  prerequisites  will  be  based  upon  required  events  from  the appropriate formal course syllabus. 2.5.2.  Training  will  be  completed  within  the  time  specified  by  the  approved  syllabus.  Failure to complete within the specified time limit requires notification to MAJCOM/A3 with aircrew member’s name, rank, delay reason, planned actions, and estimated completion date. (T-2). 2.5.3.  Aircrew will fly under direct instructor supervision until successful completion of the qualification evaluation. (T-2). 2.6.  IQT for Senior Officers: 2.6.1.  All  formal  training  courses  for  senior  officers  (Colonel  selects  and  above)  will  be conducted at the FTU unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2 (T-2). 2.6.2.  Senior  officers  must  meet  course  entry  prerequisites  and  will  complete  all  syllabus requirements unless waived IAW syllabus directives and paragraph 2.2 (T-2). 2.6.3.  If senior officers must be trained at the unit to which they are assigned, they will be in formal training status.  (T-2). Unit duties will be turned over to appropriate deputies or vice commanders  until  training  is  completed.  (T-2).  Exceptions  to  this  policy  must  be  approved by gaining MAJCOM/CC and submitted through the MAJCOM/A3. 2.6.4.  Senior Officer Familiarization Course (SOFC).  This course trains senior pilots (O-6 and above) and sensor operators (E-9) to operate the MQ-1/9 under the direct supervision of  an  instructor.    This  course  provides  a  basic  orientation  to  senior  officers/enlisted  who supervise/oversee  flying  operations  for  aircraft  in  which  they  are  not  qualified,  IAW  the ETCA.  The primary method of training is at the FTU.  Completion of this course does not establish a qualification or currency requirement. 2.7.  Weapons Instructor Course (WIC).  A formal flight training program designed to qualify MQ-1/9  instructors as USAF Weapons Officers.  The course is  conducted by 26 WPS, 57 WG. Requisites  are  listed  on  the  ETCA  webpage  and  the  MQ-1/9  WIC  syllabus.  Upon  course completion, graduates are fully qualified as USAF Weapons Officers and granted the W-prefix to the aircrew member’s AFSC. AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   17  Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  General.  Mission Qualification Training is  conducted in  two phases.  MQT begins at  the FTU during IQT.   A post-FTU unit-specific MQT program is taught at each unit to train aircrew to  accomplish  the  unit  mission  or  to  recertify  aircrew  that  have  regressed  to  N-CMR/N-BMC status.    Guidance  in  this  chapter  is  provided  to  assist  SQ/CCs  in  developing  their  unit-specific MQT  program.    Aircrew  will  maintain  BAQ  status  until  they  complete  the  unit-specific  MQT program.  Upon completion of the unit-specific MQT program, the unit commander shall assign new aircrew members BMC or CMR status. 3.1.1.  Unit  administered  MQT  programs  will  be  approved  by  the  OG/CC.  (T-3).  For AFSOC,  MQ-1/9  MQT  is  conducted  by  their  FTU,  vice  the  individual  units  and  the  MQT syllabi is approved by MAJCOM/A3T. 3.1.2.  Sorties  and  events  for  a  unit  administered  MQT  program  will  include  sorties  and events  needed  to  qualify  an  aircrew  member  in  the  unit-specific  mission  and  Tactics, Techniques,  and  Procedures  (TTP).  (T-3).      The  program  will  incorporate  unaccomplished sorties and events from the IQT syllabus. 3.1.3.  Units  will  ensure  events  not  accomplished  or  waived  at  the  FTU  are  completed  or waived before the individual is certified BMC or CMR. (T-3). 3.1.4.  Unit-specific  MQT  will  be  completed  within  120  calendar  days  (ANG/AFRC  and AFSOC:  150  calendar  days).  (T-2).  Timing  starts  from  the  member’s  first  duty  day  at  the gaining  operational  unit.  If  the  individual  elects  to  take  authorized  leave  prior  to  entering MQT, the timing will begin after the termination of leave. Training is complete upon SQ/CC certification  to  CMR/BMC.  If  training  exceeds  the  specified  limit,  units  will  notify MAJCOM Aircrew Training function (ACC/A3M, AFSOC/A3T, AFRC/A3T, NGB/A3Y) of the planned corrective action on a case-by-case basis. (T-2). 3.2.  Ground Training: 3.2.1.  Units  will  develop  blocks  of  training  covering  areas  pertinent  to  the  mission  as determined  by  the  SQ/CC.  (T-3).  Training  completed  during  IQT  may  be  credited  towards this requirement. 3.2.2.  Verification/Verification Planning Exercise (VPE).  CMR aircrew will demonstrate satisfactory knowledge of the squadron’s assigned mission to a formal board established by the  SQ/CC.    (T-3).  Desired  board  composition  is  SQ/CC  or  SQ/DO  (chairman),  weapons officer,  intelligence  officer,  ISO  or  Squadron  Operations  Supervisor,  and  a  plans representative.  Suggested verification briefing guides are in Attachment 3. 3.2.2.1.  CMR  aircrew  will  complete  a  Verification/VPE  within  180  days  after completing  MQT.    Failure  to  comply  will  result  in  regression  to  N-CMR  until  the verification is complete. (T-3). 3.2.2.2.  At Verification/VPE to facilitate future upgrade to CMR status. the  discretion  of the  SQ/CC,  BMC  aircrew  may  accomplish  a 3.2.2.3.  AFSOC crews who participate in a VPE will meet Verification requirements.   18  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 3.2.2.4.  OG/CC  may  authorize  SQ/CCs  to  count  completion  of  unit-specific  MQT programs  or  combat  and  combat  support  sorties  flown  during  MQT  as  satisfying  the Verification/VPE requirement. 3.3.  Simulator Training: 3.3.1.  PMATS  will  be  used  if  available.    MQT  aircrew  should  fly  mission  profiles  that replicate primary unit mission tasking. 3.3.2.  MQT PMATS Event Requirements: 3.3.2.1.  Instruments  and  EPs  (Emergency  Procedures).  Personal  and  mission preparation,  normal  ground  operations,  flight  operations,  navigation,  EPs,  post-flight ground operations, Critical Action Procedures (CAP), and selected non-CAP EPs. 3.3.2.2.  Surface  Attack  Tactics  and  Weapons  Anomalies.  Tactical  procedures, tactical  navigation,  weapons  deliveries  (normal  and  backup),  weapons  anomalies, emergency  divert/recovery  procedures,  hung  ordnance  procedures,  and  selected  EPs.  These missions will be accomplished using a tactical scenario. 3.4.  Flying  Training.  MQT  programs  should  use  profiles  typical  of  SQ  missions.    Maximum use of armament recording assets and actual deliveries are encouraged on all MQT missions. 3.4.1.  Supervision.  An IP and/or ISO, respective to student(s) of similar crew compliment, are required as a minimum unless specified otherwise. 3.4.2.  Prerequisites  and  Currency.  If more than 14 calendar days elapse between sorties, an additional review sortie may be flown before continuing the program. AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   19  Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General.  This  chapter,  along  with  the  current  MAJCOM-specific  guidance  (RTM  for ACC/  ACC  Gained),  outlines  ground  and  flying  CT  requirements  for  BAQ,  BMC,  and  CMR aircrew.  Aircrew must be qualified IAW this instruction, AFI 11-401, AFI 11-202V2, applicable MDS Volume 2, and applicable MAJCOM and local instructions.  Aircrew must complete IQT to  fly  in  BAQ  status;  MQT  (or  FTU  instructor  upgrade)  to  fly  in  BMC/CMR  status.    Training terms and sortie/event definitions referenced throughout this chapter are found in Attachment 1 and Attachment 2, respectively. 4.2.  Ground  Training.  Ground  training  will  be  accomplished  IAW  the  RTM  or  MAJCOM specific  guidance.    Waiver  authority  for  the  ground  training  specified  is  IAW  the  reference directive.  Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes precedence.  Ground training accomplished during IQT/MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.  The RTM is a reference for specific ground training only.  The RTM  and/or  MAJCOM  specific  guidance  does  not  include  all  AF  ancillary  training,  which should be tracked at unit level. 4.2.1.  Instrument  Refresher  Course  (IRC).  (T-2).  IAW  AFMAN  11-210,  Instrument Refresher Program, AFI 11-202V2, and MAJCOM supplements. 4.2.1.1.  Units will ensure IRC programs include briefings on recognition and how to deal with  spatial  disorientation,  unusual  attitude  recoveries,  transition  between  visual  and instrument conditions, weather avoidance, and navigation procedures. 4.2.1.2.  Units  will  also  develop  theater-specific  instrument  academic  programs  for inclusion  in  their  pre-deployment  (LRE)  or  pre-combat  (MCE)  spin-up  training programs.    Units  will  include  a  course  on  flight  operations  in  icing  conditions  with emphasis  on  the  aircraft  limitations,  capabilities,  and  avoidance  in  their  theater-specific instrument academic training. 4.2.2.  PMATS: 4.2.2.1.  The  RTM  and  MAJCOM  specific  guidance  depicts  minimum  PMATS  training requirements.    OG/CC can substitute other training devices as described in  paragraph 2.4  if  PMATS  is  not  available.    Units  will  determine  additional  CT  training  device requirements  based  on  expected  employment  tasking,  training  device  capabilities,  and mission  training  objectives.  Units  will  determine  appropriate  supervision  levels  for PMATS missions/tasks. (T-3). Units will track all aircrew device training used to satisfy RAP  and  basic  skills  requirements.    (T-3).  Note:  Aircrew  are  not  expected  to  have  or gain proficiency in EPs in phases of flight in which they are not qualified (e.g., L/R ops). 4.2.2.2.  Units  should  develop  scenarios  that  cover  all  CAPs,  EPs,  instrument  approach procedures, and other scenario requirements based on expected unit tasking and training device capabilities.  Emphasis should be placed on training not readily attainable during daily flying activities.  Units will review scenarios annually and update as required.  (T-3).  Inadvertent  weather  entry  procedures  training  and  unusual  attitude  recovery  training   20  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 will  be  accomplished  during  all  instrument  or  EP  PMATS  training.    Unusual  attitude training will include recognition of heads up display (HUD) limitations. 4.2.2.3.  Tactical and EP missions will be accomplished in a PMATS, if available. (T-3). If required, a GCS or other ATD may be used to accomplish this training. 4.2.2.3.1.  EP PMATS.  Mission Objectives: Practice EPs and maintain proficiency in applying  aircraft  general  knowledge  to  abnormal  situations.   Specific  mission  tasks: unusual  attitude  recoveries,  spatial  disorientation, inadvertent  weather  entry, controlled  flight  departure  recognition  and  recovery  procedures,  CAPs,  aircraft subsystem failure checklist procedures, in-flight EPs, and instrument procedures.  L/R aircrew  will  also  discuss/review  Stability  Augmentation  System  (SAS)-off  flight characteristics and stall recognition and recovery. 4.2.2.3.2.  Tactical PMATS.  Mission Objectives: Practice in-flight malfunctions and maintain  proficiency  in  applying  tactical  knowledge  to  combat  scenarios.    Specific mission  tasks:  DOC-relevant  simulated  combat  employment,  threat  recognition  and counter  tactics,  weapons  malfunction  procedures,  relevant  CAPs  and  aircraft subsystem failure procedures, controllability check and structural failure checklists. 4.2.3.  Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).  (T-2). 4.2.3.1.  This  monthly  training  is  not  an  evaluation,  but  a  review  of  abnormal  and emergency  procedures  and  aircraft  systems  operations/limitations  during  realistic scenarios.  One aircrew member should present a situation and another aircrew member discuss  actions  necessary  to  cope  with  the  malfunction  and  carry  it  to  a  logical conclusion.    CAPs  and  squadron  special  interest  items  should  be  emphasized.  Incorporate the following elements into the SEPT training program: 4.2.3.1.1.  SQ/CC or SQ/DO involvement in the selection of monthly SEPT topics. 4.2.3.1.2.  Develop  SEPT  scenarios  using  historical  aircraft  mishaps/incidents  as baseline cases. 4.2.3.1.3.  At a minimum, aircrew members will discuss all CAPs applicable to their qualifications, and at least two EPs. Additionally, L/R aircrew members will discuss at least two EPs relevant to L/R operations.   Units should review all applicable EPs in section 3 of the flight and munitions delivery manuals annually. 4.2.3.2.  SEPT  will  be  accomplished  for  the  month  the  aircrew  is  flying.  Currency  will expire at the end of the calendar month. A SEPT may be accomplished the month prior, but will only count for one month (i.e. a SEPT accomplished at the end of May can count for  June,  but  June  only).    Aircrew  with  expired  SEPT  are  grounded  until  the  SEPT  is completed for that month.  Aircrew will accomplish a minimum of one SEPT every 180 days with an IP or ISO. 4.2.3.3.  SEPTs  should  be  accomplished  in  the  best  ATD  available  or  a  GCS.    If  a PMATS  or  GCS  is  not  available,  SEPTs  should  be  accomplished  as  a  crew  with participation  to  the  full  extent  and  share  equal  time  responding  to  EPs.  SEPTs  are accomplished independent of mass briefing and EP of the day. 4.2.3.3.1.  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluations  (EPEs)  can  be  used  to  fulfill  monthly SEPT requirements. AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   21  4.2.3.3.2.  Completion of an EP profile satisfies the aircrew member’s monthly SEPT requirement, if not already accomplished.  Instructors administering a supervised EP PMATS  mission  or  FEs  administering  EPEs  will  satisfy  their  monthly  SEPT requirement. 4.2.3.3.3.  Formal  course  student  EP  PMATS  can  satisfy  the  monthly  SEPT requirement for the IP/ ISO who administers the training. 4.2.4.  Weapons/Tactics  Academic  Training.  (T-2). Units will establish a weapons/tactics academic training program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements.  Training is required IAW the RTM or MAJCOM specific guidance.  The program will require successful completion of an  examination  (85  percent  minimum  to  pass).    Use  testing  to  validate  qualification  to  the maximum extent possible throughout the training program.  Aircrew successfully scoring 85 percent or greater may be given training credit in lieu of ground CT, where authorized by the governing publication.  Audiovisual/computer based training programs may be used in place of academic instruction. 4.2.4.1.  Academic  instructors  should  be  USAFWS  graduates,  tactics  personnel,  or experienced  instructors,  and  will  determine  training  requirements  based  on  unit-  and theater-specific mission requirements and unit DOC statement. 4.2.4.2.  Instruction and tests should include (as applicable), but not limited to: 4.2.4.2.1.  Air-to-surface  weapons:  description,  operation,  parameters, limitations, preflight, tactics, normal and EPs/techniques. fusing, 4.2.4.2.2.  Capabilities, characteristics, and TTPs of other CAF assets that the aircraft may integrate with in theater-specific operations. 4.2.4.2.3.  AFTTP to include, as a minimum: AFTTP 3-1.General Planning, General Planning  and  Employment  Considerations;  AFTTP  3-1.Threat  Guide,  Threat Reference  Guide  and  Countertactics;  and  applicable  MDS  AFTTP  3-1,  Tactical Employment. 4.2.4.3.  Develop  specialized  training  to  support  specific  weapons,  TTPs,  mission capabilities,  authentication,  Rules  of  Engagement  (ROE),  and  safe  passage  procedures, and where applicable: 4.2.4.3.1.  Counterland and Reconnaissance  (SCAR)  procedures,  and  Close  Air  Support  (CAS)  procedures  with Forward Air Controller (FAC) and/or Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC). include  Strike  Coordination procedures, to 4.2.4.3.2.  Intelligence,  Surveillance,  Reconnaissance  (ISR)  procedures;  to  include Reconnaissance Surveillance and Target Acquisition (RSTA) procedures. 4.2.4.3.3.  On-Scene  Commander  (OSC)  and  Combat  Search  and  Rescue  (CSAR) procedures. 4.2.4.3.4.  Combat operations lessons learned. 4.2.4.3.5.  Theater specific threat reviews. 4.2.4.3.6.  Air Operations in Maritime Surface Warfare (AOMSW). 4.2.5.  Take-off/Landing/Go-around Training (L/R qualified crews only).  (T-2).   22  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 4.2.5.1.  During initial L/R qualification, L/R instructor upgrade, L/R requalification, and semi-annually thereafter, L/R aircrew will receive Take-off/Landing/Go-around academic training.  If  aircrew  go  non-current  on  landings,  they  will  receive  this  training  prior  to their landing re-currency sortie. 4.2.5.2.  Training  will  include  proper  takeoff/landing  techniques  and  procedures, approach procedures and techniques, GPS landing system (GLS) use, crosswind landings, go-arounds  (decision  making,  planned,  un-planned,  IP  directed,  etc.),  hard-landings, bounces and porpoise recovery, problems associated with limited visual cues, and HUD symbology.  Training  should  include  video  from  previous  mishaps  to  show  relationship between  the  lack  of  visual/somatic-sensory  cues,  and  the  result  of  continuing  a  bad approach/landing. 4.2.5.3.  SQ/CCs may implement more periodic L/R continuation training programs with instructor-supervised  L/R  events  to  provide  instructor  feedback  on  pilot  landing techniques and execution and sensor operator duties.  These programs should encourage use of L/R observer’s review and critique of landing techniques and procedures. 4.2.6.  Crew  Resource  Management  (CRM).  (T-2).  Aircrew  members  will  participate  in MAJCOM  established  CRM  CT  at  the  frequency  stated  in  the  RTM  or  MAJCOM-specific guidance (reference AFI 11-290 Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement).  Training builds upon the basic cockpit management skills  taught  in  SUPT,  URT,  and  FTUs.      Briefings  and  debriefings  will  include  the  core curriculum  of  CRM  training  IAW  AFI  11-290  and  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  supplement. The CRM instructor course may be used to satisfy the periodic requirement. Training will be tracked in ARMS.  The RTM or MAJCOM-specific guidance identifies actions required for failure to attend CRM training. 4.2.7.  Unit  Intelligence  Training.  (T-2).  Units  will  conduct  this  training  IAW  AFI  14-2MQ-1&9V1, “MQ-1 and MQ-9 Unit Intelligence Training”. 4.2.8.  Intelligence Oversight Program.  (T-2). Units will conduct this annual training IAW Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5240.1-R, “Procedures Governing the Activities of DOD  Intelligence  Components  that  Affect  United  States  Persons”;  and  AFI  14-104, “Conduct of Intelligence Activities”. 4.2.9.  Law  of  Armed  Conflict  (LOAC)  for  RPA  Operations.  (T-2).  Units  will  conduct this training IAW MAJCOM-specific guidance. 4.3.  Flying  Training.  All  aircrew  (except  API-8  and  ACC/IGI  aircrew)  will  accomplish  the mission and event requirements listed in the most current RTM and MAJCOM specific guidance as  applicable  to  their  crew  position  and  qualifications.    (T-2).  Failure  to  accomplish  these requirements will not affect BAQ, BMC, or CMR status, but may require additional training as determined by the SQ/CC.  API-8 and ACC/IGI flyers will strive to accomplish as many of the requirements as practical.  In addition, the following are required: 4.3.1.  BAQ Requirements.  (T-2). 4.3.1.1.

Designated  Training Requirements.  (T-2). (TF-coded)  and  Designated  Test (CB-coded)  Unit 4.3.5.1.  Aircrew assigned or attached to TF or CB-coded units should fly, as a minimum, at  the  BMC  rate;  however,  they  are  not  required  to  complete  BMC-specific missions/events  or  meet  monthly  lookback  requirements.    Formal  training  syllabus-directed  missions  and  approved  test  plan  missions  apply  to  BMC  rate  requirements  for TF and CB-coded units respectively.  EXCEPTION:  Pilots in TF/CB-coded units will fly the  Aircraft  Handling  Characteristics  (AHC),  Pattern  Proficiency  Sortie  (PPS)  and  EP PMATS listed in the RTM or MAJCOM specific guidance. 4.3.5.2.  Instructors  must  be  current  and  qualified  in  all  events  they  instruct.  Failure  to maintain  an  individual  currency  will  not  affect  instructor  status,  but  requires  additional training as determined by the SQ/CC before instructing that event.  For CB-coded units, SQ/CCs  may  designate  instructors  as  initial  cadre  to  instruct  new  events  under  an approved test plan. 4.3.5.3.  Ground training as directed by the SQ/CC. 4.3.5.3.1.  There  is  no  requirement  for  aircrew  assigned  or  attached  to  TF-coded  or CB-coded units to accomplish verification. 4.3.5.3.2.  There  is  no  requirement  for  CB-coded  units  to  accomplish  formal intelligence  training  or  weapons  and  tactics  academics.    Aircrew  will  be  thoroughly familiar  with  all  current  intelligence  and  weapons  and  tactics  issues  affecting  on-going test projects. 4.3.5.4.  SQ/CC will direct the addition of sorties if programmed syllabus or test missions do not provide sufficient aircrew proficiency training. 4.3.5.5.  Instrument/QUAL/MSN or Instructor flight evaluation, as applicable, IAW AFI 11-202V2, and applicable MDS Volume 2.  Aircrew assigned/attached to CB-coded units need not maintain instructor status. 4.3.6.  Weapons  Qualifications  (ACC/ACC-Gained  Only)  (T-2).  QUAL  criteria  is  12 record deliveries per training cycle with an overall record hit rate of 50%.  FAM criteria per training cycle is 6 events.  Hit criteria (%) for FAM is not specified. 4.4.  Special Categories: 4.4.1.  Flight Surgeon.  Flight surgeons may participate in CT missions as observers.  Units will develop  appropriate CT mission orientation  programs  for  assigned flight  surgeons.  (T-2). 4.4.2.  Above-Wing-Level  Aircrew  (ARC:  Responsibilities  for  API-8  staff  flyers  are contained in AFI 11-401 as supplemented by the ANG and AFRC) (T-2): 4.4.2.1.  Mission Directed Training (MDT) for Above-Wing-Level personnel (other than that  conducted  in  support  of  a  formal  inspection)  requires  coordination  with  the supporting  unit.    MAJCOM  Division  Chiefs  are  the  reviewing  authorities  for  assigned personnel and will: 4.4.2.1.1.  Coordinate  with  the  supporting  agency  to  ensure  maintenance  of appropriate ARMS data and provide that data IAW AFI 11-401. AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   25  4.4.2.1.2.  Review  assigned  aircrew  accomplishments  and  currencies  prior  to authorizing participation in MDT. 4.4.2.1.3.  Provide each aircrew with written documentation specifying the authorized mission  types  and  events  the  aircrew  may  fly.    Above-Wing-Level  aircrew  who  fly with only one unit may receive this from their attached unit commander. 4.4.2.2.  Above-Wing-Level aircrew maintaining BMC status are exempt from academic ground training and special training programs within authorized mission areas.  Specific currencies will be provided to the host squadron and squadron supervisors will determine aircrew qualifications to participate in squadron scenarios for MDT. 4.4.2.3.  Aircrew will (T-3): 4.4.2.3.1.  Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy. 4.4.2.3.2.  Submit qualification and authorization documentation along with currency information to the supporting squadron supervisors prior to flying with that SQ. 4.4.2.3.3.  Evaluate the demands of each mission scenario and ensure that they do not exceed their ability and proficiency. 4.4.2.4.  With  the  concurrence  of  the  OG/CC,  instructor-qualified  aircrew  may  perform instructor  duties  provided  they  have  qualification  and  currency  for  the  applicable missions and events. 4.4.3.  Active Duty aircrew flying with ANG and AFRC units: 4.4.3.1.  Wing/group  air  advisor  rated  personnel  on  duty  with  operational  training  units can maintain CMR and may be qualified as an IP and FE. 4.4.3.2.  Active duty aircrew other than assigned advisors are authorized to fly with ARC units IAW AFI 11-401 as supplemented by ANG and AFRC. 4.4.3.3.  Aircrew  on  exchange  programs  from  active  duty  units  are  authorized  mission oriented  sorties  IAW  specific  OPLAN  that  establishes  the  exchange.    SQ/CCs  may authorize their participation IAW their specific experience and qualification. 4.4.3.4.  HHQ staff aircrew may participate in tactical training events.  Each member will present  AF  Form  1042,  Medical  Recommendation  for  Flying  or  Special  Operational Duty,  currencies,  flight  qualifications,  any  other  documentation  required  for  flight  as determined  by  unit  Aviation  Resource  Management  (ARM)  office  to  the  unit  where flying is performed. (T-2). 4.5.  Multiple Qualifications (T-2): 4.5.1.  MAJCOM/A3  may  authorize  qualification  in  more  than  one  MDS  for  aircrew  when command  mission  requirements  direct  it  and  multiple  qualifications  is  economically justifiable.    MAJCOMs  cannot  delegate  this  authority.    Unless  required  for  unit  mission accomplishment,  SQ/CCs  must  not  permit  aircrew  qualified  in  primary  mission  aircraft  to maintain qualification in support aircraft. 4.5.1.1.  Units will submit multiple qualification requests through command channels  to MAJCOM/A3.  All requests must contain full justification.  Units will provide multiple   26  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 qualification  approval  to  the  appropriate  host  base  flight  management  office.    Do  not authorize flight accomplishments until aircraft assignment is updated in ARMS. 4.5.1.2.  When  members  are  no  longer  assigned  to  the  unit  requiring  multiple qualifications,  the  members’  multiple  qualification  authorization  will  expire.    Members will assume the primary MDS of gaining unit, if applicable. 4.5.1.3.  Multiple  qualifications  are  not  appropriate  for  senior  wing  supervisors  of  units with different types of aircraft.  WG/CCs will qualify in only one of their wing's aircraft, while  the  WG/CV  or  OG/CC  should  qualify  in  another  of  the  wing's  aircraft  differing from the WG/CC). 4.5.1.4.  Aircrew approved for multi-qualification training will attend the TX-3 course at the appropriate FTU unless specifically authorized local IQT by MAJCOM/A3. 4.5.2.  Multiple Currencies.  (T-2). Aircrew qualified in multiple MDS will fly at least once each  45/30  (EXP/INEXP)  days  in  each  aircraft.    They  will  comply  with  all  other  currency requirements for each aircraft. 4.5.3.  Multiple  Requirements.  (T-2).Aircrew  members  will  satisfy  at  least  50  percent  of their  sortie  requirements  in  their  primary  aircraft.  If  CMR,  aircrew  will  fly  an  equitable distribution (as determined by OG/CC) of their sortie and event requirements in each MDS. 4.5.3.1.  If L/R qualified in multiple aircraft, aircrew will comply with all L/R currencies of each aircraft.  They will fly an equitable distribution (as determined by OG/CC) of L/R event requirements in each MDS. 4.6.  Currency, Recurrency, and Requalification (T-2): 4.6.1.  Currency.  Table 4.1 through Table 4.3 as supplemented by the most current RTM or MAJCOM  specific  guidance,  defines  currency  requirements  for  MQ-1/9  aircrew.    If  an aircrew  member  loses  a  particular  currency,  the  individual  may  not  perform  that  sortie  or event  except  for  the  purpose  of  regaining  currency  as  noted.    Unless  otherwise  noted  in Table 4.1 through Table 4.3, instructors must actually perform the event to update currency. 4.6.2.  MCE  Recurrency/Requalification.  Aircrew  will  require  additional  training  if  a currency requirement is not met. 4.6.2.1.  Recurrency.  Aircrew  must  accomplish  overdue  training  requirements  as directed by the SQ/CC before they are considered recertified to perform the task.  Non-current aircrew must demonstrate proficiency in non-current  event(s) to  an instructor in the same crew position current and qualified in the event(s).  Events performed under the supervision of an instructor may be credited toward the applicable currency period. 4.6.2.2.  Loss of Mission Currency Sortie equal to or greater than 180 days results in loss of  qualification.    Requalify  IAW  AFI  11-202V1,  AFI  11-202V2,  this  instruction,  and applicable MDS Volume 2. 4.6.3.  L/R Operations Recurrency/Requalification.  The following actions are required to regain  currency  or  QUAL.    Timing  starts  from  date  of  last  landing.    (Note:  aircrew  may continue to fly missions not requiring aircraft landing or L/R operations). 4.6.3.1.  Loss of currency up to 90 days.  Regain landing currency.

To  regain  instructor  status,  the  instructor  must successfully  complete  a  QUAL/MSN  flight  evaluation  IAW  AFI  11-202V2  and applicable MDS Volume 2. 4.6.4.2.  They  fail  a  qualification,  instrument,  or  tactical  examination.    To  regain instructor  status,  the  instructor  must  successfully  accomplish  the  written  exam  they previously failed. 4.6.4.3.  Instructor  currency  expires  (N/A  AFSOC).  Instructor  currency  must  be regained with an instructor of the same crew position current and qualified in the event. To regain status, see Table 4.1 through Table 4.4 4.6.4.4.  They  become  non-current  in  any  event  or  sortie  that  causes  removal  from CMR/BMC status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance to require de-certification.  If the SQ/CC does not elect to de-certify, or if the instructor becomes non-current in events or sorties which do not require removal from CMR/BMC status,  the  individual  may  retain  instructor  status,  but  will  not  instruct  in  that  event  or sortie until regaining the required currency.

See the  RTM  for  live  fly  and  PMATS  lookback  requirements  and  reference  Figure  4.1  for necessary  decisions/actions  to  maintain/regain  CMR/BMC  status.    If  aircrew  do  not  meet lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CCs may regress them to N-CMR or  N-BMC  status  (as  applicable),  remove  them  from  a  CMR  manning  position,  or  initiate action to remove them from active flying status. 4.7.2.  Regression  for  Weapons  Qualification.  (T-2).  Failure  to  maintain  MAJCOM-directed specific tasked weapons qualification at the end of the training cycle will require: 4.7.2.1.  For  events  tasked  as  QUAL  at  CMR/BMC.  Regression  to  N-CMR/N-BMC unless  waived  by  OG/CC.    To  regain  CMR/BMC,  the  aircrew  member  must  re-accomplish  qualification  in  the  deficient  weapons  event  (see  paragraph  5.2).    Events accomplished  for  this  qualification  may  count  toward  the  cumulative  CT  event qualification required at the end of the training cycle. AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   29  4.7.2.2.  For  events  tasked  as  FAM  at  CMR/BMC.  Regression  to  N-CMR/N-BMC unless waived by OG/CC.  To regain CMR/BMC, the aircrew member must accomplish at  least  three simulated weapons deliveries reviewed by an  IP/ISO, matching their crew qualification.    Events  accomplished  for  this  requalification  may  count  toward  the cumulative CT event qualification required at the end of the training cycle. 4.7.3.  Regression for Failed Evaluations.  In addition to the requirements of AFI 11-202V2 and  applicable  MDS  Volume  2,  aircrew  who  fail  a  periodic  evaluation  will  regress  to  N-CMR/N-BMC as applicable. Aircrew will remain N-CMR/N-BMC until accomplishing AFI 11-202V2 requalification requirements and are re-certified by the SQ/CC. 4.7.4.  Failure to Maintain Flying Standards.  If a qualified aircrew member demonstrates lack  of  proficiency  or  knowledge  during  CT  (not  related  to  a  flight  evaluation)  the  SQ/CC may elect to regress the individual to N-CMR or N-BMC as applicable.  These aircrew will remain N-CMR or N-BMC until successfully completing corrective action as determined by the SQ/CC, an evaluation (if required), and are re-certified by the SQ/CC.   30  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 Figure 4.1.  Regression Flow Chart. 4.8.  End of Cycle Requirements (Lookback N/A for AFSOC).  Aircrew who fail to complete RAP requirements by the end of the training cycle may require additional training depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency.  Refer to  paragraph  4.9 for proration policy.  In all cases report training shortfalls IAW paragraph 1.2  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   31  4.8.1.  Aircrew  who  fail  to  meet  the  total  MAJCOM-directed  sortie  and/or  event requirements  may  continue  CT  as  CMR  or  BMC  aircrew  as  determined  by  lookback.    The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is required. 4.8.2.  Failure to meet RAP Sortie Requirements will result in the following: 4.8.2.1.  Regression to  N-CMR or N-BMC if the  SQ/CC determines that the sortie type deficiency is significant.  To regain CMR or BMC, the aircrew member will complete all deficient sortie types.  Units may count these sorties against the total requirements for the new training cycle. 4.8.2.2.  Continuation at CMR or BMC if the aircrew member maintains total MAJCOM-directed  sorties  and  lookback  and  the  SQ/CC  deems  the  sortie  type  deficiencies insignificant. to  accomplish  missions/events 4.8.3.  Failure for  special  capabilities  or certifications/qualifications will result in loss of that certification/qualification.  The SQ/CC will  determine  re-certification  requirements.  Requalification  requirements  are  IAW  AFI11-202V2 and applicable MDS Volume 2. required 4.9.  End-of-Cycle  Proration.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle,  SQ/CCs  may  prorate  training requirements  when  any  of  the  following  events  preclude  training  for  a  portion  of  the  training period: Duty Not Including Flying (DNIF), emergency leave, permanent change of station (PCS) availability,  and  non-flying  temporary  duty  (TDY)/exercises  (ANG/AFRC:  mandatory  training required by civilian employment).  Loss of training due to ordinary annual leave will not result in proration.  SQ/CCs may consider proration due to extended poor weather or other environmental factors that preclude the unit from flying for more than one half of the monthly scheduled flying days  (ANG/AFRC:  End-of-cycle  proration  is  permitted  for  documented  attrition,  such  as  HHQ or  weather  cancels,  maintenance  non-deliveries,  ground  or  air  aborts,  in  monthly  increments when  the  total  number  of  occurrences  ranges  from  one  half  to  one  times  the  aircrew’s  normal monthly  rate  of  flying).  Commanders  will  not  prorate  for  time  deployed  for  contingency operations unless the individual(s) were assigned to non-flying positions. 4.9.1.  Proration  will  only  be  used  to  adjust  for  genuine  circumstances  of  training  non-availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies. 4.9.2.  Proration is  based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying (to include post-deployment comp time) during the training cycle.  Use Table 4.4 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on cumulative calendar days of non-availability. 4.9.3.  Prorated  numbers  resulting  in  fractions  of  less  than  0.5  will  be  rounded  down  to  the next lower whole number, but no requirement shall be prorated below one (except when 100 percent of logged missions/sorties are contingency operations). 4.9.4.  Consider  newly  assigned  or  converted  aircrew  and  aircrew  achieving  CMR  or  BMC status  after  the  15th  of  the  month  to  be  in  CT  on  the  first  day  of  the  following  month  for proration purposes.  Aircrew will complete prorated RAP sorties/events in CT. 4.9.5.  If  IQT  is  re-accomplished,  an  aircrew  member’s  training  cycle  will  start  over  at  a prorated share following completion of IQT/MQT. 4.9.6.  SQ/CCs  may  prorate  an  aircrew  member's  last  month  on  station  prior  to  departing PCS  provided  they  do  not  exceed  one  month's  proration.    Units  may  consider  individuals   32  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 departing PCS CMR for reporting purposes for 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station.

Regaining CMR and BMC Status (T-2): 4.10.1.  If  CMR/BMC  status  is  lost  due  to  failure  to  meet  the  End-of-Cycle  weapons qualifications  requirements  or  end-of-cycle  MAJCOM  specific  event  requirements, requalification is IAW paragraph 4.7 4.10.2.  If  an  aircrew  member  loses  CMR  or  BMC  status  due  to  failure  to  meet  sortie lookback IAW paragraph 4.7, the following applies (timing starts from the date the aircrew came off CMR or BMC status): 4.10.2.1.  Up  to  90  Days.  The  aircrew  member  must  complete  a  SQ/CC  directed  re-certification program IAW paragraph 4.6  In addition, all RAP event currencies must be regained.  The  SQ/CC  will  approve  any  additional  training  prior  to  re-certification  to CMR. 4.10.2.2.  91-180  Days.

Member must re-accomplish a SQ/CC-directed MQT program to include a formal MSN evaluation. 4.11.  Example  of the  Lookback,  Regression,  Proration,  and  Requalification Process.  Captain  Smith  is  an  experienced  CMR  aircrew  member  with  a  1-  and  3-month lookback requirement of 4 and 10 RAP sorties respectively.  On February 3, Captain Smith flew a  sortie  prior  to  departing  for  a  non-flying  TDY  staff  tour  for  two  months.    Captain  Smith reported back for flight duty on 6 April.  What is Captain Smith's status throughout the TDY and on return to flying duty? 4.11.1.  The  SQ/CC  wanted  to  list  Captain  Smith  as  a  CMR  aircrew  member  for  reporting purposes throughout  the  TDY.  Therefore, on 1  March, Captain Smith's  Flight  Commander performed  the  mandatory  1-month  lookback  (February).    Captain  Smith  only  flew  one AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   33  MAJCOM-specific  sortie,  failing  the  1-month  lookback.    The  Flight  Commander  then performed  a  3-month  lookback  (Dec,  Jan,  and  Feb).    This  3-month  lookback  showed  that Captain Smith flew only 7 sorties for the period.  Had Captain Smith flown two more sorties, the  SQ/CC  could  continue  him  at  CMR.    However,  with  7  sorties,  Captain  Smith  did  not meet the 3-month lookback for a CMR aircrew member.  The SQ/CC could regress Captain Smith to N-CMR, but instead elected to put him on probation, still carrying him as CMR. 4.11.2.  The  SQ/CC  carried  Captain  Smith  on  one  month's  probation.    On  1  April,  Captain Smith's 1-month lookback (March) was zero sorties.  The SQ/CC must now regress Captain Smith to N-CMR.  When Captain Smith returns on 6 April, the SQ/CC must place him in a re-certification  program.    Upon  completing  this  program,  Captain  Smith  must  then  re-establish  a  1-month  lookback  by  1  May.    Failing  to  re-establish  a  1-month  lookback  by  1 May forces the unit to report Captain Smith N-CMR one more month until the next lookback process on 1 June. 4.11.3.  If Captain Smith had returned on 22 March and had last landed 48 days ago, he could fly  a  RAP  sortie  with  an  instructor  to  regain  sortie  currency.    For  CMR  purposes,  Captain Smith  must  fly  4  RAP  sorties  to  recapture  a  1-month  lookback  and  be  removed  from probation. 4.11.4.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle  on  30  June,  the  SQ/CC  prorated  two  months  of Captain  Smith's  total  requirements.    Despite  the  proration,  Captain  Smith  was  deficient  in one  RAP  sortie  category.    The  SQ/CC  could  regress  Captain  Smith  to  N-CMR,  if  deemed significant.    After  he  accomplished  the  tailored  re-certification  program  (the  deficient sorties),  the  SQ/CC  re-certified  Captain  Smith  to  CMR.    This  training  counts  for  the  new training cycle.   34  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 Chapter 5 WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION 5.1.  General.  This chapter outlines requirements for attaining initial weapons qualification and maintaining  qualification  in  the  employment  of  air-to-surface  weapons.    Refer  to  "Glossary  of Events" in Attachment 2 for further guidance in weapons events. 5.2.  Initial  Weapons  Qualification.  Aircrew  members  must  accomplish  initial  weapons qualification  in  any  weapons  event  requiring  qualification  at  CMR  or  BMC.  (T-2).    Initial qualification  achieved  in  IQT/MQT  satisfies  requirements  for  CT  qualification,  but  not  for  CT event requirements. 5.3.  CT  Qualification/Maintaining  Weapons  Qualification.  These  criteria  establish  the minimum  standards  for  a  crewmember  to  maintain  weapons  qualification  in  the  appropriate event  and  do  not  necessarily  determine  evaluation  criteria  established  by  other  regulations  or agencies (e.g., inspection or evaluation teams).  Qualifications are valid throughout the following training period. 5.3.1.  CT  weapons  deliveries  (to  include  simulated  deliveries)  will  be  tactical  deliveries simulating  realistic  employment  of  weapons;  considering  such  factors  as  arming,  safe separation, recovery, safe escape maneuver, egress, etc., using USAF Technical Order (TO) 1-1M-34,  Aircrew  Weapons  Delivery  Manual  (Nonnuclear)  as  a  reference.    CT  weapons deliveries  should  simulate  realistic  employment  of  munitions.    Maximize  the  use  of  air-to-surface tactical ranges for weapons event requirements. 5.3.2.  (N/A  AFSOC)  .  Weapons  qualification  will  be  maintained  by  completing  the minimum  number  of  record  hits,  record  deliveries,  and  also  by  achieving  appropriate qualification percentage during the training period.  (T-2). Periodic qualification hit rate will be  no  less  than  50  percent.    See  the  RTM  or  MAJCOM  guidance  for  specific  qualification criteria. 5.3.3.  (N/A  AFSOC)  .  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle,  crewmember’s  weapons  delivery scores will be reviewed to assess weapons qualification. (T-2). 5.4.  Failure  to  Qualify.  Failure  to  qualify  in  one  weapon  series  does  not  invalidate qualification  in  others.    SQ/CCs  may  declare  a  crewmember  unqualified  in  any  weapon,  and invalidate  all  previous  record  deliveries  for  that  weapon,  at  any  time  during  a  training  cycle without affecting other  weapons qualifications.  If qualification is  required for CMR, failure to qualify  will  result  in  regression  to  N-CMR  and  entry  into  a  re-certification  program  until  re-qualification is accomplished, unless waived by OG/CC. 5.5.  Weapons  Delivery.  A weapons delivery event includes target acquisition followed by the actual  or  simulated  laser  designation,  weapons  release,  and  weapon  impact;  ending  with  a tactical escape maneuver for the ordnance being delivered (or simulated). 5.5.1.  Weapons  Employment  Parameters.  The  event  requirements  and  parameters  listed below  form  the  basic  framework  for  weapons  employment  training.    All  weapons employment  will  conform  to  the  limits  established  for  each  specific  event.    Pattern descriptions,  procedures,  training  rules,  and  foul  criteria  are  contained  in  AFI  11-2MQ-1&9V3 and AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures. AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   35  5.5.1.1.

FAM  for  weapons  does  not  require  a  hit  rate  when  compared  to  total  employment attempts.  The RTM further defines FAM requirements based on the training cycle. 5.6.  Full  Scale  Weapons  Delivery  (FSWD).  FSWD,  live  and  inert,  ordnance  training  is essential  to  combat  capability.    Every  attempt  should  be  made  to  give  crewmembers  the opportunity  to  employ  as  many  types  of  weapons  on  the  Unit  Committed  Munitions  List  as possible.   36  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 Chapter 6 SPECIALIZED TRAINING 6.1.  General.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  eligibility  criteria  and  the  training requirements  for  upgrade  and  specialized  training.    These  capabilities  and  qualifications  are  in addition  to  primary  missions  for  the  unit  and  may  not  apply  to  every  crewmember  assigned  or attached to the unit. 6.2.  Instructor Upgrade (T-2): 6.2.1.  SQ/CCs  will  select  only  the  most  qualified  aircrew  members  as  instructors, considering  ability,  judgment,  technical  knowledge,  skill,  and  experience.    SQ/CCs  will personally  review  each  instructor  candidate’s  qualifications  and  select  instructors  based  on their background, experience, maturity, and ability to instruct.  The following characteristics must be considered: 6.2.1.1.  Instructional  Ability.  All  initial  instructor  upgrade  candidates  will  complete training  on  the  principles  of  instruction  during  the  appropriate  formal  school  upgrade course. 6.2.1.2.  Judgment.  The  candidate  must  possess  the  judgment  necessary  to  meet unexpected  or  induced  emergencies  and  the  ability  to  exercise  sound  judgment  through mature realization of their own, their student’s, and the aircraft’s limitations. 6.2.1.3.  Personal Qualities.  The candidate must have patience, tact, understanding, and the knowledge and ability to instruct others. 6.2.1.4.  Technical  Knowledge.  The  candidate  must  be  thoroughly  familiar  with respective  aircraft  systems  and  equipment,  normal  and  emergency  operating  procedures and  the  prohibited  maneuvers  and  aircraft  performance  under  all  conditions  of  flight.  Additionally, all instructors and examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the applicable portions of AFI 11-401; AFI 11-202V1, 2, and 3; AFI 11-2MQ-1&9V3; this instruction; and applicable AFTTP3-1 and AFTTP3-3 series publications. 6.2.1.5.  Flying Experience.  Candidates must possess a reasonable background of flying experience to have developed desired standard of knowledge, judgment, and proficiency.  Normally,  these  qualities  progress  together.    However,  flying  hours  alone  cannot  be accepted as criteria for any one or all qualities. 6.2.1.6.  Tactical  Experience.  The  instructor  must  be  familiar  with  how  their  aircraft can be employed in threat areas.  They must be familiar with AFTTP applicable volumes. 6.2.2.  Initial Candidates.  All initial instructor upgrade candidates must be mission ready in their  unit’s  mission  and  be  experienced  in  the  applicable  MDS.  First  time  instructors  must complete  Instructor  Fundamentals  I  and  II,  from  the  Flight  Instructor  Preparatory  (FIP) curriculum found in the Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS), prior to beginning instructor upgrade. 6.2.3.  MCE Instructor Pilot Upgrade (IPUG) and Instructor Sensor Operator Upgrade (ISUG)  Ground  Training.  This  paragraph,  along  with  paragraphs  6.2.4  and  6.2.5, outlines  the  minimum  requirements  for  unit  MCE  IPUG  and  ISUG  upgrade.  (Note:  for AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   37  AFSOC,  completion  of  AFSOC’s  MCE  instructor  upgrade  course  will  satisfy  these requirements).  Units  should  consider  adding  additional  sorties  (allowing  a  dedicated  sortie per mission type) based on DOC statement mission sets. 6.2.3.1.  Principles  of  Instruction/Instructor  Theory.  Learning  objectives,  instructor responsibilities, instructor-student relationship, training facilities, publications, and MDS specific training considerations. 6.2.3.2.  Techniques  of  Flight  Instruction.  Training  objectives  and  environment, recognition  and  analysis  of  common  aircrew  errors,  maneuver  demonstration,  task performance and review, and instructional limitations. 6.2.3.3.  Conduct  of  Flight  Briefing.  Instructor  will  provide  an  example  of  an instructional flight briefing. IPUG/ISUG trainee will learn different techniques to deliver an  instructional  flight  briefing  (use  of  briefing  guides  and  audiovisual  aids,  briefing, questioning  techniques,  and  use  of  recorded  media  during  flight  execution  for  review during debrief.) 6.2.3.4.  IPUG/ISUG-Led Instructor Flight Briefing.  IPUG/ISUG trainee will conduct a mission brief providing “how to” instruction using techniques learned from paragraph 6.2.3.3  IPUG/ISUG  trainee  will  accomplish  premission  planning,  determine  level  of assistance  the  “student”  needs,  determine  mission  requirements,  and  brief  mission execution from beginning to end. 6.2.3.5.  Systems  Refresher  Training.  Subject  knowledge  evaluation  and  practical demonstration.  Instructor  candidates  must  demonstrate  an  advanced  knowledge  of  GCS and aircraft systems  and associated operational  equipment to include: power-up, power- down,  and  reboot  procedures,  emergency  shutdown  procedures,  expanded  checklist procedures,  pilot-sensor  operator  (PSO)  rack  displays,  controls  and  procedures,  internal and external communication procedures, aircraft operations and limitations, and airborne handover procedures. Fundamentals.  Instructor mission 6.2.3.6.  Debriefing planning/flight/mission  debriefing  to  include  administration,  reconstruction,  review  of recorded media, and lessons learned. IPUG/ISUG trainee will learn how to identify root causes  and  provide  instructional  fixes  to  correct  errors  where  improper  procedures  are used. will review 6.2.3.7.  IPUG/ISUG  Led  Academic  Lesson  Instruction.  IPUG/ISUG  trainee  will deliver a mission instructional briefing to cover specific systems or mission academics. 6.2.3.8.  Instructor CRM.  Instructor CRM training will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-290, and MAJCOM supplements, prior to assuming duties as an instructor.  This lesson will  cover  leading  a  crew  as  an  instructor  in  an  RPA  environment  with  MDS  specific considerations. Instructor CRM training may be accomplished prior to entering instructor upgrade training. 6.2.3.9.  Student Evaluations.  This lesson will review the AFI 11-202V2 and MDS V2 evaluation  standards  to  provide  a  frame  of  reference  for  new  instructors  on  what boundaries exist for training and standards students should be held to for success.   38  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 6.2.4.  Instructor  Upgrade  Device  Training.  IPUG/ISUG  trainees  should  receive  the following  minimum  PMATS  training.  Note:  Units  without  PMATS  are  exempt  from  this requirement;  however,  Tactical  Mission  and  Emergency  Procedures  Instruction  may  be accomplished in a “cold” GCS at the unit’s option. 6.2.4.1.  PMATS  Operation  and  Procedures.  The  IPUG/ISUG  trainee  will  learn PMATS  power  up  and  power  down  procedures  and  instructor  operator  station  (IOS) power  up  and  power  down  procedures.  The  upgrade  student  will  operate  the  IOS.  The upgrade student will load and run a tactical scenario and make injects to the scenario. 6.2.4.2.  Tactical  Mission  Instruction.  Trainee will perform instructor duties and other tasks as required for a PMATS training mission. 6.2.4.3.  Emergency  Procedures  Instruction.  The  IPUG/ISUG  trainee  will  conduct instruction on emergency procedures with emphasis on recognition and correction of the EP.  IPUG/ISUG  candidates  must  be  able  to  teach  students  to  recognize  the  correct emergency situation and take proper corrective action. 6.2.5.  Instructor  Upgrade  Flight  Training.  Specific  training  events  do  not  have  to  be accomplished  on  specified  sorties.    However,  all  events  must  be  accomplished  within  the construct of the upgrade program. Ku link and Handover (gaining/losing) procedures may be instructed  on  any  sortie.    Inability  to  complete  specific  training  events  need  not  delay certification.    In  such  cases,  SQ/CC  will  certify  instructors  with  appropriate  limitations  to preclude  performance  of  duties  in  which  training  is  incomplete.  Unit  programs  should specify which tasks the upgrade candidate will practice demonstrating, which tasks they will practice evaluating a performance, and which tasks they will do both. 6.2.5.1.  Basic  Instruction  Sortie.  Practice  instructing  basic  flight  procedures.

L/R  Instructors  are  recommended  to  first  be  MCE instructors.    They  will  meet  all  of  the  above  requirements  and  be  experienced  in  L/R operations  IAW  paragraph  1.6    (AFSOC  Only):  L/R  instructors  will  be  upgraded  using AFSOC approved L/R IPUG/ISUG syllabi. They will be experienced in L/R operations IAW paragraph 1.6. 6.2.6.1.  MCE  instructors  who  receive  an  L/R  qualification  may  attain  L/R  instructor status  upon  becoming  experienced  in  L/R.    This  qualification  enables  the  instructor  to provide supervision for  L/R events  that are not  part of a formal  course.  SQ/CCs should ensure the squadron letter of certification (LoX) track L/R instructors separate from MCE instructors. 6.2.6.2.  At a minimum, L/R instructor candidates should review L/R-related Flight Crew Information  Files,  L/R  operational  guidance,  local  operating  procedures,  traffic  pattern operations,  airfield  procedures,  and  frequency  coordination.  In  addition,  L/R  instructor candidates should receive training from a current and qualified L/R instructor of the same crew position in at least: 6.2.6.2.1.  One  PMATS  covering  common  errors  experienced the  L/R environment,  emergency  procedures  during  L/R  operations  (SFOs,  aborts,  etc.),  and instructor intervention techniques. in 6.2.6.2.2.

They will complete the applicable MDS Formal Instructor Upgrade Training (FIUT) syllabus for the FTU. 6.3.  Flight  Examiner  (FE)  Upgrade.  (T-2).  FE  upgrades  and  certification  will  be accomplished  IAW  AFI  11-202V2,  applicable  MDS  Volume  2,  and  applicable  MAJCOM supplements. 6.4.  Contingency  and  Exercise  Pre-Deployment  Training.  Conduct  this  training  prior  to deploying  in  support  of  contingency  operations  or  combat  exercises.    The  objective  of  this training  is  to  ensure  aircrew  member’s  ability  to  conduct  all  missions  in  support  of  expected tasking. 6.4.1.  Exercises.  For  exercises,  units  are  responsible  for  referring  to  appropriate  exercise plans (EXPLAN) and contacting appropriate exercise points of contact to determine expected mission tasking (ACC EXPLANs include EXPLAN 80 for Red and Maple Flags, EXPLAN 323 for Green Flag West, and EXPLAN 163 for Green Flag East). 6.4.2.  Contingency  Operations.  For  contingency  operations,  units  are  responsible  for contacting  appropriate  gaining  command  or  organizations  to  determine  expected  mission   40  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 tasking.    Prior  coordination  ensures  unit  preparation  for  the  appropriate  tasking  and  allows the  responding  OG/CC  to  tailor  spin-up  training  for  the  theater,  threat,  and  tactics  for  the assigned task.  The SQ/CC is responsible for implementing spin-up training, prosecuting the required missions, and determining the specific requirements necessary to reach the desired level of proficiency.  Unit training will emphasize preparation for missions not accomplished in  daily  operations.    Conduct  spin-up  training  IAW  all  applicable  instructions.    Deploying aircrew must have completed applicable CBRNE defense training courses, and other required pre-deployment  requirements  IAW  applicable  directives.  OG/CCs  are  responsible  for ensuring  all  participating  aircrew  are  ready  to  execute  contingency  operations  and  are proficient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. 6.4.3.  Attached and Supporting Aircrew.  Aircrew not assigned to the supported SQ must receive  spin-up  training  as  determined  by  the  supported  SQ/CC.  (T-3).  This  requirement applies to all attached aircrew (OG, WG, HQ staffs, etc.) and all aircrew supporting from any other SQ.  The objective of this spin-up training is to ensure attached and supporting aircrew are  proficient  to  conduct  all  expected  missions.    The  supported  SQ/CC  determines  the amount  of  spin-up  training  required  for  each  attached  and  supporting  aircrew  based  on  the individual's level of proficiency, currency, qualification, experience, etc.  The supported and supporting  SQ/CCs  (or  equivalent)  will  jointly  agree  on  the  administration,  documentation, and evaluation of required spin-up training. 6.4.4.  Ground  Training.  Aircrew  may  be  required  to  complete  academic  training  prior  to contingency  operations  or  exercises.    Units  will  brief  contingency  (or  exercise)  Special Instructions  (SPINS),  ROE,  and  Command  and  Control  (C2)  procedures.  (T-3).    Programs will  emphasize  deployment  airfield  capabilities,  limitations,  approach  procedures,  and hazards.  In addition, air defenses, area terrain, weather, and unique operating procedures will be  addressed.    The  local  Weather  Flight  can  assist  with  weather-unique  training.    Local intelligence  organizations  may  assist  the  unit's  intelligence  functions  in  the  development  of threat assessments, training materials, and expected collection tasking. 6.4.5.  Flying  Training.  Tailor  spin-up  training  to  ensure  all  supporting  aircrew  are proficient, current, and qualified in expected mission tasking. 6.5.  Difference Training.  (T-2). 6.5.1.  Difference training for initial cadre is usually conducted under the supervision of the engineering specialists (usually coordinated through program office officials) responsible for improving the aircraft systems (e.g. new engines, baseline upgrades, major software changes, etc.).  These personnel will provide training for an initial cadre whenever possible.  In some instances, it will be necessary for units to form an initial cadre of personnel for whom certain training requirements will be waived.  Instructors completing difference training will provide upgrade  training  to  other  unit  aircrew.    Air  Force  Life  Cycle  Management  Center/WII, Detachment  3  (AFLCMC/WII  Det  3)  will  be  considered  the  primary  unit  for  difference training  when  new  systems  come  online  which  represent  major  changes  from  current configurations; 53 TEG/556 Test and Evaluation Squadron is the alternate unit. 6.5.2.  The following conditions apply to management of initial cadre qualification: 6.5.2.1.  Form  a  nucleus  of  instructor  and  flight  examiner  personnel  (initial  cadre)  to begin  aircrew  upgrades.    Initial  cadre  will  not  be  designated  in  a  crew  position  higher AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   41  than  currently  held  unless  previously  qualified.    The  host  unit  providing  training  will document  all  DT  and  maintain  the  training  folder  until  successful  completion  of  the upgrade  program.    Initial  cadre  aircrew  are  responsible  for  completing  recommended training  on  any  equipment,  systems,  or  crew  procedures  which  differ  from  that  in  the MDS they are currently qualified. 6.5.2.2.  The OG/CC (or equivalent) will determine which training events are applicable, after  examining  the  training  and  evaluation  records  of  initial  cadre  and  determine  if  a certification  is  applicable  or  whether  a  qualification  evaluation  (check  ride)  is  required.  OG/CC  may  require  aircrew  to  complete  a  written  examination  prior  to  unsupervised flight when EPs have changed; even if an AF Form 8 Certificate of Aircrew Qualification flight evaluation is not required.  Forward a copy of proposed training qualification plan to MAJCOM/A3 when training requires a flight evaluation. 6.5.3.  Difference training not requiring an evaluation should be annotated in the individual’s training records and tracked in the unit LoX. 6.6.  L/R Training.  (T-2).  The goal of this training is to produce aircrew proficient in MQ-1/9 launch,  takeoff,  pattern,  handoff,  transition,  landing,  and  recovery  operations.    The  primary method of course completion is at an FTU.  Secondary method of training is in-unit (if primary method unavailable) using formal school courseware and syllabi.  Secondary method of training requests must be submitted IAW Chapter 2.  Completion of L/R QUAL training will conclude with an AF Form 8 flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and applicable MDS Volume 2. 6.6.1.  Upgrade  to  L/R  operations  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  SQ/CC  based  on  standard squadron  operations,  taskings,  and  manning.    Crews  qualified  in  L/R  operations  will  be qualified IAW applicable MDS Volume 2 and certified by the SQ/CC (i.e., LoX). 6.6.2.  For individuals never qualified in MQ-1/9 L/R operations, upgrade training will meet the syllabus course prerequisites and follow the course flow in the MQ-1/9 Pilot and Sensor Operator Launch/Recovery Training Course syllabus.  All candidates should be experienced in MCE operations prior to beginning an L/R training course. 6.6.3.  The  OG/CC  may  approve  local  L/R  requalification  training  to  aircrew  previously qualified in L/R operations within the last three years in the same MDS. Timing starts from the  date  of  the  loss  of  L/R  QUAL.  An  abbreviated  SQ/CC-approved  course  may  be administered.  Forward copy of unit re-qualification program to gaining MAJCOM Aircrew Training function (ACC/A3M, AFSOC/A3T, NGB/A3Y, AFRC/A3T). 6.6.3.1.  SQ/CCs  will  base  unit-level  L/R  training  programs  on  the  applicable  MQ-1/9 Launch/Recovery Training Course. 6.6.3.2.  Mishap videos should be used to the maximum extent possible when reviewing MDS-specific landing mishaps. 6.6.4.  Upon  successful  completion  of  an  L/R  course,  any  L/R  restriction  will  be  removed from the aircrew member’s MDS AF Form 8. 6.6.5.  Aircrew that become unqualified IAW paragraph 4.6.3 due to loss of currencies and not completing a requalification course prior to their next flight evaluation, will receive the L/R restriction from AFI11-2MQ-1&9V2 on their AF Forms 8.   42  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 6.7.  Test  Qualification.  556  TES/CC  will  ensure  newly  assigned  and  attached  aircrew members complete a unit derived program to certify aircrew members as test qualified.  TOD D.

Visual Identification is not synonymous with Positive Identification. Weapons Delivery—Simulated or actual expenditure of munitions representing a typical combat configuration or standard conventional load in a tactical scenario.    52  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 GLOSSARY OF MISSION/SORTIE AND EVENT DEFINITIONS Attachment 2 A2.1.  Sortie and Mission Definitions: A2.1.1.  Sortie. The operational nature of MQ-1/9 requires clarification of the term “sortie” within the scope of this AFI.  An MQ-1/9 flight is defined as initial takeoff until the full stop landing.  A sortie, for documenting events accomplished, is the portion of the flight in which an individual aircrew member performs his or her assigned duties.  For the purposes of this instruction the terms mission and sortie are synonymous. A2.1.2.  Logging  Sorties.    Normally,  aircrew  members  will  not  log  more  than  one  type  of sortie on a single flight, unless: A2.1.2.1.  Specifically allowed in the sortie description (i.e. instructor sortie). A2.1.2.2.  An aircrew performs both MCE and L/R operations on the same sortie. A2.1.2.3.  An aircrew member is relieved by another aircrew member for the purpose of accomplishing  a  sortie,  and  subsequently  takes  over  the  position  again  during  the  same flight. A2.1.3.  L/R Time.  L/R time is time logged by an L/R crewmember controlling a Remotely Piloted  Aircraft  (RPA)  inside  the  terminal  area  while  actively  accomplishing  launch  and recovery  events  using  Line  of  Sight  (LOS)  communications  for  RPA  control.  The  Launch phase  is  defined  as  the  initiation  of  the  Takeoff  checklists  through  the  completion  of  the Climb, Level Off, and Cruise checklist (LRE outbound). The Landing phase is defined as the initiation  of  the  Descent  checklist  through  the  completion  of  the  After  Landing  checklist (LRE inbound). Crewmembers performing Touch and Go operations within the terminal area can log  L/R time, but  cannot  log any Takeoff or  Landing  event  unless they performed said action. A2.2.  Specific Sortie definitions: A2.2.1.  Attrition Sortie.  A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training sortie, Non-RAP sortie,  or  collateral  sortie  that,  due  to  some  circumstance  (weather,  in  flight  emergency, maintenance,  etc.),  fails  to  accomplish  the  planned  mission.    Improper  accounting  of  these sorties  will  result  in  improper  sortie  allocation,  stresses  to  the  unit  schedule,  and  negative impacts to the quality of unit training programs. A2.2.2.  Close  Air  Support  (CAS)  Sortie.  Counterland  mission  sortie  flown  in  support  of ground forces under the control of a FAC or JTAC.  Mission elements include: A2.2.2.1.  Intelligence scenario and combat mission planning. A2.2.2.2.  Mission execution against actual or simulated threats. A2.2.2.3.  Simulated or actual weapons delivery under JTAC or FAC positive control. A2.2.2.4.  Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) and INFLTREP. A2.2.3.  Collateral  Sorties.  These  sorties  do  not  directly  relate  to  combat  employment  or basic  skills  training  but  are  necessary  for  accomplishment  of  day-to-day  unit  operations.    These sorties are not required for RAP training purposes. AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   53  A2.2.4.  Commander  Option  Sortie.  A  sortie  that  may  be  used  to  provide  individualized training  based  on  proficiency  and  demonstrated  performance.    This  sortie  may  be  allocated above the guidelines in the RTM for all mission types.  The intent is to use these missions as necessary  throughout  the  training  cycle,  rather  than  allocating  them  at  the  beginning  of  the training cycle. A2.2.5.  Contingency Operations Sortie.  Sorties at a contingency location, or in support of real-world operations. Units may use Contingency Operations Sorties for lookback purposes.  RAP events accomplished during sorties logged as Contingency Operations may be counted toward  training  cycle  RAP  requirements  if  effective  training  per  this  instruction  and  the RTM/MAJCOM-specific  guidance  was  accomplished.    Individual  events  flown  during contingency operations can be used to update currencies. A2.2.6.  Mission  Currency  Sortie.  Operate  the  aircraft  controls  (pilots)  or  sensor  operator controls  (sensor operators) in  flight.   Aircrew members may dual  credit a mission currency sortie in conjunction with any type of sortie flown.  Log Mission Currency Sorties on training or  operational  missions.    In  order  for  instructors/evaluators  to  credit  a  mission  currency sortie,  they  must  actively  control  the  aircraft  (pilots)  or  sensor  operator  controls  (sensor operators) for a portion of the sortie. A2.2.7.  Pattern Proficiency Sortie (PPS) (only required for L/R-qualified crews). A PPS is a mission to practice instrument, transition, traffic patterns, and EPs.  A PPS can be logged at the discretion of the aircrew when sufficient training has been accomplished.  A PPS should be  briefed  as  a  standard  alternate  mission  whenever  possible.    A  single  PPS  may  be accomplished over the course of either 2 or 3 sorties if unable to  accomplish all tasks on a single PPS.  PPS with tasks spanning multiple days will be logged on the day of the final task completion.  As reference, a PPS will consist of the following: A2.2.7.1.  Review of CAPs. A2.2.7.2.  Visual approach(s). A2.2.7.3.  IR MTS touch and go/landing(s). A2.2.7.4.  Nose camera and IR nose camera touch and go/landing(s). A2.2.7.5.  SFO(s). A2.2.7.6.  Go-around(s). A2.2.8.  Strike  Coordination  and  Reconnaissance  (SCAR)  Sortie.  During  counterland operations:  perform  kinetic  strike  against  pre-assigned  or  adhoc  target(s),  act  as  primary killbox controller, perform as reconnaissance or attack platform utilizing an airspace control plan,  deconfliction  coordination,  identification  and  acquisition  of  target,  collateral  damage estimate  determination,  provide  controller-to-striker  brief  (9-line),  BDA,  and  INFLTREP.  Simulated attacks may be conducted against realistic targets IAW local restrictions.  Mission elements include: A2.2.8.1.  Intelligence scenario and combat mission planning. A2.2.8.2.  Positive  control  of  attack  elements  employing  simulated  or  actual  ordinance against designated targets.   54  AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015 A2.3.  Events.  An  event  is  defined  as  a  specific  type  of  target  acquisition  or  weapons employment  performed  during  a  sortie  or  the  accomplishment  of  a  specific  training  element, function, or task (i.e., buddy lasing, handover procedures, SAT, etc.).  Unless otherwise specified in the event descriptions, units will determine the necessary parameters for fulfilling and logging tasked  events.    Accomplishing  a  specific  training  event  is  independent  of  the  type  of  sortie logged.  In the absence of guidance, units determine the frequency and number of events. A2.3.1.  Weapons  Delivery.  A  delivery  event  is  defined  as  a  pass  at  a  target  on  which ordnance  is  expended,  or  simulated,  and  meets  the  criteria  defining  a  specific  weapon delivery.    These  delivery  events  will  be  used  to  update  weapons  qualifications  and currencies.    Weapon  events  are  defined  in  Chapter  5.    All  deliveries  will  be  recorded,  but not necessarily as a "record" delivery. A2.3.1.1.  Categories.  A  delivery  constitutes  a  weapons  delivery  event  based  on  two categories:  by  record  keeping  (Record  or  Non-Record)  and  by  RAP  tasking  (FAM  and QUAL): A2.3.1.1.1.  Non-Record.  Basic  or  Tactical  weapons  delivery  accomplishments  not credited toward weapons qualification provided the aircrew declares non-record prior to beginning event. for scored A2.3.1.1.2.  Record.  Conventional  delivery individual  weapons qualification.    Scoring  shall  be  accomplished  by  ground,  air,  or  DVR  scoring,  as appropriate.    A  maximum  of  two  record  deliveries  may  be  accomplished  during  a sortie  from  a  single  run-in  heading.    Additional  record  deliveries  may  be accomplished  from  headings  differing  by  at  least  90  degrees  or  on  different targets/ranges and may not be preceded by non-record deliveries in the event on the same  sortie.    The  first  two  deliveries  will  be  considered  record  unless  otherwise declared  prior  to  the  roll-in  to  final.    Scores  will  be  documented  by  circular  error probable and clock position.  Additional guidelines are: A2.3.1.1.2.1.  FAM.  Weapons events tasked at FAM may be basic/tactical record deliveries.  Each single pass counts as one delivery.  Unless otherwise specified in the RTM or formal  course syllabi,  FAM tasking  requires six weapons deliveries annually. A2.3.1.1.2.2.  QUAL.  Weapons  tasked  at  QUAL  must  be  tactical,  record deliveries.  QUAL tasking demonstrates the aircrew's capability to put appropriate ordnance  on  target.    Unless  otherwise  specified  in  the  RTM  or  formal  course syllabi, QUAL criteria is established for each event in Chapter 5. A2.3.2.  Miscellaneous Weapons Delivery Definitions and Descriptions: A2.3.2.1.  Dry  Pass.  Weapons  delivery  pass  during  which  no  ordnance  is  expended.  Such  dry  passes  prior  to  completion  of  record  deliveries  in  an  event  are  charged  to  the aircrew  as  gross  error  unless  pass  was  dry  because  of  safety  interests,  system malfunctions, basic delivery requirements, or directed for flight integrity purposes. A2.3.2.2.  Foul.  A penalty directed to a specific aircraft and crew for actions inconsistent with  established procedures or safety considerations.  A foul will result in  a gross  error for that delivery.  Verbal warnings will not be substituted for fouls.  A second foul or any AFI11-2MQ-1&9V1  23 APRIL 2015   55  dangerous pass will result in mandatory expulsion from any further deliveries during that mission  and  a  gross  error  score  for  the  event.    A  foul  will  be  charged  IAW  flying directive publications. A2.3.2.3.  Full Scale Weapons Delivery.  Delivery of live or inert ordnance in a combat configuration.  Also known as live-fire. A2.3.2.4.  Gross Error.  A penalty score or miss assigned to an aircrew's records when a weapons  delivery  attempt  results  in:  munitions  impact  outside  the  range  scoring capability,  a  chargeable  dry  pass,  a  foul,  an  unintentional  release,  or  exceeding  tactical delivery time on final requirements. A2.3.2.5.  Hit.  Any  munitions  impact  within  the  weapons  criteria  established  for  that event. A2.3.2.6.  Single/Multiple  Release.  One  or  more  weapons  released  against  the  same target on a single pass. A2.3.2.6.1.  Intentional.  The aircrew must advise the range officer prior to delivery and designate which impact to be scored. A2.3.2.7.  Inadvertent.  Ordnance which has released without command by the aircrew.  Impact will not be scored. A2.3.2.8.  System  Malfunction.  An  undeclared  multiple  release  caused  by  a  verified system  malfunction.    Score  is  void  after  system  malfunction  verification,  otherwise, unintentional rules apply. A2.3.2.9.  Unintentional.  Ordnance released due to aircrew error will be scored as gross error regardless of impact point. A2.3.2.10.  No  Spot.  A weapons release during  which no impact  was observed.   In the event  the  instructor/evaluator  (if  no  instructor/evaluator  present,  PIC)  believes  the  No Spot is due to ordnance malfunction upon impact, no score or error will be assigned.  In the event the No Spot was due to crew error, delivery results in Gross Error. A2.3.2.11.  Void  Delivery.  Weapons  delivery  not  successfully  completed  due  to:  a documented and verified weapons system malfunction, pass aborted for safety, No Spot, or circumstances beyond the control of the aircrew. A2.3.3.  Tactical/Basic  Skills  Events.  The  following  is  an  alphabetical  listing  of  events  to be used for fulfilling tasked requirements.  In the absence of guidance, units will determine the content of tasked events and how often they may be logged. A2.3.3.1.  Aircraft  Handling  Characteristics  (AHC).  Basic  flying  skills  event.  Training  for  proficiency  in  utilization  and  exploitation  of  the  aircraft  flight  envelope, consistent  with  operational  and  safety  constraints.
