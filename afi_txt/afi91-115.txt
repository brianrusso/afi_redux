It  incorporates multiple format changes for ease of use and currency.  The C-17 Aircraft does not have external Chaff,  this  reference  has  been  removed  from  the  instruction.    Paragraph  12,  Personnel Qualifications  and  Certification,  in  its  entirety  has  been  deleted.    Paragraph  22.2.,  changed  the requirement  to  now  have  at  least  one  “qualified”  personnel  in  Command  Disable  System procedures remaining on the aircraft.  Restrictions on aircraft with forward firing ordnance were added to paragraph 16, Airfield and Airspace Requirements. Section A—Authority and Responsibilities 1. The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF).
