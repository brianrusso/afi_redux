It provides guidance for the HAF corporate review process for resource planning, programming, budgeting and  execution  of  the  HAF Portfolio,  as  well  as  the  office  of  SAF/AAR  for  day-to-day control  and  execution  of  HAF  programs  and  budgets.  The  HAF  Portfolio  includes  the Secretariat and Air Staff organizations, centrally-managed  programs (i.e. Army Post Office Mail, Personnel Security Investigations, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Bill, etc.), Air Force Elements (AFELMS)  and  HAF Field Operating Agencies (FOAs).  The objective of the HAF Resource Management  Process  is  to  address  resource  pl anni n g,  programming, budget, and execution issues for the HAF Portfolio through a corporate review and  approval  process  to  ensure  the  HAF  Portfolio  effectively  competes  for  resources. Additionally,  this  process  will  provide  for  the  management  and  utilization  of  manpower positions assigned within  the  HAF Portfolio (with certain exceptions).  HAF Portfolio in this guidance is defined, OAC 15 funds received based on Execution Plan submissions by the Principles  of  the  Secretariat,  Air  Staff  organizations,  AFELMS,  and  FOAs.    In programming  it  means  Program  Objective  Memorandum  (POM)  submissions  by  the Principles of the Secretariat, Air Staff organizations, AFELMS and FOAs.  For Manpower and personnel, the programming comprises of OACs 9P, 4A and the OACs for each FOA, which covers the Secretariat, Air Staff, AFELMS (in CID 3V) and FOAs.    This document defines the roles and responsibilities of SAF/AAR, the Program and Budget 2    HOI 65-5 14 JUNE 2016 Review  Board  (PBRB),  the  Program  and  Budget  Review  Group  (PBRG),  and  each  HAF two-letter  organization  with  regard  to  resource  planning,  programming,  budgeting  and execution. Throughout this document the term “resources” is inclusive of HAF manpower and dollars.

HAF  Resource  Management  Process.  The  HAF  Portfolio  will  be  managed  within  the constraints  of  DoD  7000.14-R,  Financial  Management  Regulation;  AFPD  16-5,  Planning Programming and Budgeting System; AFI 65-601 Volume 3, The Air Force Budget Corporate Process; AFI 16-501,  Control and Documentation of Air Force Programs; AFI 38-101,  Air Force  Organization;  AFI  38-201,  Management  of  Manpower  Requirements  and Authorizations; AFI 38-202, Air Force Management Headquarters and Headquarters  Support Activities;  AFI  38-204,  Programming  USAF  Manpower;  AFPD  36-5,  Civilian  Personnel Resource Management; and AFI 36-502, Managing Civilian Personnel Resources; and other related policy and appropriate HAF annual planning, programming, budget and/or execution guidance.   Defense Health Program (DHP) will be managed by AF/SG authorities within prescribed PPBE process associated with the Military Health System (MHS) directives to ensure appropriate interface with HAF constructs.  Figure  1,  HAF  Resource  Management  Process, depicts  the  flow  of  resource  management  information  and  decisions  within  the  HAF.  This process applies to planning, programming, budgeting and  execution within the HAF Portfolio. The  specific  responsibilities  and  applicable  membership  of the HAF organizations, as they relate to the HAF resource management process, are contained in  subsequent paragraphs.

HAF two-letters will respond to tasks  for  their  entire portfolio,  including  their  assigned  Air  Force  Elements  and FOAs  for  all  fund  codes. The  requested  information  flows  back  into  SAF/AAR,  who  validates  the  inputs,  analyzes the  requirements,  and integrates  them  into  a  “strawman”  for  the  PBRG.  Prior to the PBRG meeting, SAF/AAR will arrange a working  group with two-letter organizations  to  develop  a draft integrated and  prioritized submission.  Once PBRB approval  is  received, SAF/AAR, as appropriate,  will  submit  the  applicable  documents  to  HAF  two-letter  organizations and will follow the directed approach and priorities when responding to Air Force Corporate Structure deliberations or executing programs.  2.
