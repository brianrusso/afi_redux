Major changes include accounting  for  a  major  reorganization  realigning  AF  Weather  Agency  (AFWA)  from  a  Field Operating  Agency  under  the  HQ  USAF  to  a  specialized  mission  wing  under  Air  Combat Command (ACC), and establishing oversight bodies. AFI 15-182  12 MARCH 2015   3  Chapter 1 GENERAL GUIDANCE 1.1.  Overview.  This  instruction  identifies  general  roles  and  responsibilities  for  AF-wide weather  capabilities-based  activities  to  ensure  AF  units  receive  adequate  equipment  and facilities,  to  include  Army  equipment  and  facilities  in  support  of  the  weather  functional  Army support mission according to AFI 15-157, Interservice Publication (IP), Weather Support for the U.S.  Army.    Organizational  responsibilities  outlined  in  standard  Department  of  Defense  (DoD) and  AF  directives  or  program-specific  agreements  are  not  duplicated  in  this  document.    This instruction details roles and responsibilities for management of the AF Weather Weapon System (AFWWS).    The  AFWWS  is  a  family  of  systems  (FoS)  composed  of  atmospheric  sensing, ground-based  space  environmental  sensing,  specification  and  forecast  modeling,  environmental monitoring satellite and non-traditional source data processing systems programs that provide an integrated, cross-command, cross-service capability to characterize the environment and provide mission-tailored  atmospheric  and  space  weather  information.    This  instruction  also  includes weather  functional  roles  for  Space-Based  Environmental  Monitoring  (SBEM)  (e.g.,  Defense Meteorological  Satellite  Program,  Weather  System  Follow-on)  space-based  environmental collection systems.   4  AFI 15-182  12 MARCH 2015 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Weather Functional Capabilities-Based Requirements and Oversight 3.1.1.  Address  data, information,  and product  needs using the support  assistance request  in accordance  with  AFMAN  15-129,  Volume  2,  Air  and  Space  Weather  Operations  - Exploitation. 3.1.2.  This  instruction  does  not  prescribe  or  describe  the  internal  requirements  processes conducted at combatant commands or MAJCOMs.  All requirements for weather support that will involve investment funds (e.g., upgraded capabilities, new sensors, and systems) will be forwarded  through  command  channels  for  validation  (usually  by  a  MAJCOM),  and forwarded  to  the  Lead  Command  (with  courtesy  copy  to  HQ  USAF/A3W)  for  assessment and operational capability requirements development. 3.1.3.  Requirements  from  outside  the  AF,  e.g.,  Federal  agencies  or  the  combatant commands,  should  be  staffed  through  the  appropriate  organizations,  e.g.,  through  Office  of the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  (OUSD)  for  Acquisition,  Technology,  and  Logistics (AT&L),  or  the  Joint  Staff,  respectively.    U.S.  Army  needs  will  be  staffed  according  to applicable interservice instructions. 3.1.4.  Weather Functional Capabilities Area Steering Group (WFCA SG). 3.1.4.1.  The  WFCA  SG  is  the  senior  weather  functional  activity  to  review  and recommend  prioritization  of  cross-command  capability  needs  to  the  Lead  Commands.  The  WFCA  SG  is  chaired  by  HQ  USAF/A3W  and  managed/facilitated  by  the  Lead Commands  for  their  respective  programs.    Using  and  Implementing  Commands  and provide representatives to the WFCA SG.  This forum enables: 3.1.4.2.  The Lead Commands to provide status and use of the AFWWS and SBEM, and associated operational capability requirements development. 3.1.4.3.  User Commands to provide feedback and input on the AFWWS and SBEM. 3.1.4.4.  Implementing Commands to provide status of integrated life cycle management of the AFWWS and SBEM. 3.1.5.  Weather Information System Development Oversight Body. 3.1.5.1.   A significant portion of the AFWWS is dependent upon software intensive systems and  uses  software  development,  to  include  models,  products,  and  forecaster  tools.  JCIDS allows  for  the  evolutionary  development  of  these  capabilities  using  the  “Information Technology (IT) Box” model.  Part of the model requires the use of a flag-level organization to validate detailed follow-on requirement and solution oversight of these information system programs.    The  Weather  Information  System  Development  Oversight  Body  serves  this function for AFWWS programs implementing the “IT Box” model with Information System (IS)  Initial  Capabilities  Documents  (ICDs)  or  IS  Capability  Development  Documents (CDDs). AFI 15-182  12 MARCH 2015   7  3.1.5.2.  The  Lead  Command  will  host  the  Weather  Information  System  Development Oversight  Body  to  ensure  the  software  development  is  executed  efficiently.    The Implementing  Commands  will  participate  in  and  advise  this  body.    Members  of  the Oversight Body are from organizations identified in Chapter 2.  The Lead Command, in coordination  with  the  Implementing  Commands,  will  present  to  the  body  proposed requirements and solutions for programs in  Information System development for review and approval. 3.1.5.3.   All requirements are governed by JCIDS, as implemented via AFI 10-601, 3.2.  Management of Allowance Documents and Real Property Requests. 3.2.1.  Table 2.1. describes actions and responsible activities for managing allowance documents and Army real property requests. 3.2.1.1.  AF  Allowance  Standards.    The  Lead  Command  identifies  equipment  allowance standards  as  part  of  developing  materiel  solutions  to  warfighter  needs.    HQ  USAF/A3W reviews  applicable  AF  allowance  standards  (Allowance  Source  Codes  (ASC)  786/789) aperiodically to ensure proper authorization standards. 3.2.2.  Army  Tables  of  Organization  and  Equipment  (TOEs)  and  Modified  Tables  of Organization and Equipment (MTOEs).  According to AFI 15-157(IP), the Army documents standard Army equipment and personnel for use by AF weather personnel in the appropriate TOE  and  provides  recommended  MTOE.    Staff  Weather  Officers  (SWOs)  will  submit change requests through their chain of command, as needed.  Nominally, they are reviewed bi-annually  during  a  TOE/MTOE  validation  prior  to  being  staffed  to  HQ  DA  through HQ USAF/A3. 3.2.2.1.  Bi-annual  TOE/MTOE  Validation.    HQ  USAF/A3W  will  convene  a  review board  comprised  of  Special  Operations  Forces  (SOF),  HQ  DAMI-PI  and  Combat  Air Forces (CAF) MAJCOM weather functionals to review each MTOE and any requests for change.    Each  MAJCOM  weather  functional  may  request  subject  matter  experts  attend from  affected  weather  units.    MAJCOM  weather  functionals  may  request  unit  audits  of on-hand  MTOE  equipment  to  support  review  during  the  verification  meeting  and  to identify deficiencies that might be systemic and require HQ USAF/HQ DA intervention.  SOF-funded  equipment/personnel  should  be  reviewed  using  Special  Operations  Forces Capabilities  Integration  and  Development  System  (SOFCIDS)  processes.    See  United States  Special  Operation  Command  (USSOCOM)  Directive  71-4,  Special  Operations Forces Capabilities Integration and Development System (SOFCIDS). 3.2.2.2.  HQ  USAF/A3W  will  compile  suggested  changes  and  recommendations  and provide the appropriate documentation to HQ USAF/A3 for endorsement to HQ DA. 3.2.3.  Army  Real  Property.    AF  units  that  receive  facility  support  according  to  AFI  15-157(IP)  from  their  Army  host  will  submit  requests  for  real  property  to  their  supporting community activity.   8  AFI 15-182  12 MARCH 2015 Table 3.1.
