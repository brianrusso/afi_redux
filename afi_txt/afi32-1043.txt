Compile  and  document  all  information  from  the  aircraft  arrestment  reports  to ensure availability of the data for analysis of specific system performance and use.   8  AFI32-1043  4 MARCH 2015 Chapter 2 CERTIFICATION AND OPERATION 2.1.  System Certification. 2.1.1.  All Air Force arresting gear (excluding MA-1A, E-5, BAK-15, textile brake, and soft ground  arrestor  systems)  that  have  not  been  engaged  at  a  speed  sufficient  to  exercise  the hydraulic system within the past 12 months must be certified by an aircraft engagement. (T-2) The recommended minimum speed for certification engagement is 75 knots regardless of aircraft  weight.  For  BAK-12  and  MAAS,  aircraft  speeds  reported  at  less  than  75  knots  are also  acceptable  as  long  as  the  hydraulic  system  is  exercised.  To  qualify  as  a  valid certification  engagement,  each  hydraulic  selector  valve  must  shuttle  from  static  pressure  to pump  pressure.  Certification  engagements  will  be  made  toward  the  center  of  the  runway. This  may  require  the  aircraft  starting  position  to  be  in  the  overrun  area.  Note:  Validate overrun pavement is constructed to withstand aircraft load. This requirement also applies to initial system installations and after a brake change or absorber overhaul. It does not apply to War Reserve Materiel systems in storage. 2.1.2.  If  extenuating  circumstances  prevent  certification  by  engagement,  a  certification inspection must be performed or the system must be removed from service. The certification inspection  must  be  performed  by  the  MAJCOM  AAS  Manager.  (T-2)    For  annual certification requirements, the inspection must be accomplished on or before the anniversary of  the  last  system  engagement.  The  inspection  must  include  (but  is  not  limited  to)  all requirements  in  Section  5  of  the  applicable  35E8-series  T.O.  The  period  between  aircraft engagements must not exceed 24 months. Assigned installation maintenance personnel  may not  perform  the  inspection.  Certification  inspections  cannot  be  substituted  for  initial installation certification engagements. Note: The installation commander has the authority to direct that new system installations are placed in service or those overdue for certification or overhaul are kept in service for critical missions.  (T-2) If such an order is given, it must be documented  in  the  maintenance  records  and  the  MAJCOM  AAS  manager  notified immediately.   Overdue systems may  only  remain in  service  for one  additional  year beyond the original date of required certification or overhaul. (T-1) 2.2.  Operation. 2.2.1.  Disconnect  and  remove  unidirectional  barrier  nets  and  pendant  cables  located  in overruns  on  the  approach  end  of  the  runway.  (T-3)  Also  disconnect  and  remove  BAK-9 cables  located  on  the  runway  on  the  approach  end.  (T-3)  Full-size  net  systems  such  as  the BAK-15  may  remain  in  place  in  the  overrun  in  the  down  position;  however,  the  energy absorbers  must  be  disconnected  and  the  BCE's  designated  representative  must  inform  the Airfield Manager and the MAJCOM/A3 and SE when the net will be left in place. (T-2) Do this to publicize the potential hazard to aircrew. 2.2.1.1.  If  environmental  conditions  require  frequent  system  configuration  changes (runway  changes)  for  MA-1A  or  MA-1A  modified  net  systems,  E-5,  BAK-9,  or  textile brake systems, the nets and cables may be left in place on the approach end of the runway to avoid excessive runway downtime and/or excessive wear from abrasion; however, the AFI32-1043  4 MARCH 2015   9  nonstandard  configuration  must  first  be  recommended  by  the  installation  commander coordinated by the MAJCOM/A7 and SE, and approved by the MAJCOM/A3. (T-2) 2.2.1.2.  Additionally,  for  all  unidirectional  systems  (MA-1A,  E-5,  BAK-15,  and  MB 60.9.9.C), the energy absorbers must be disconnected from the engaging device(s) before operations commence in the opposite direction (toward the unidirectional system). (T-3) 2.2.1.3.  For MB 60.9.9.C textile brake systems, after the cable is disconnected from the yoke on both ends, the 31.75-millimeter (1.25-inch) -diameter cable should be secured to the eye-loop of each Tirfor anchor plate or to an added anchor point to prevent movement due  to  jet  blast.  Use  standard  10-millimeter  (0.375-inch)  -diameter,  three-strand  nylon rope (NSN 4020-00-968-1356) like that used for cable tie-downs.   10  AFI32-1043  4 MARCH 2015 Chapter 3 OBTAINING NEW SYSTEMS AND INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS 3.1.  Obtaining New Systems. 3.1.1.  Identify new system requirements to the MAJCOM and AFCEC, in turn, at least two years in advance, or as soon as new requirements are known, to allow sufficient lead-time for budgeting, contracting actions, manufacturing, and delivery. 3.1.2.  The  BCE's  representative  processes  new  requirements  received  from  the  operations group  commander  or  air  expeditionary  group  commander  by  first  coordinating  with  the MAJCOM  AAS  Manager.  The  MAJCOM  AAS  Manager  coordinates  the  new  requirement with  the  MAJCOM  Operations  Division  (A3O),  Flight  Safety  Division  (SEF),  and  Civil Engineer  Operations  Division  (A7O),  and  responds  to  the  installation’s  request.  Once MAJCOM  endorsement  is  received,  the  installation  representative  submits  an  AFEMS request to the base equipment management office (BEMO). (T-2) 3.1.3.  The  MAJCOM  AAS  Manager  must  identify  all  new  requirements  to  AFCEC/CO during the call for new requirements. 3.1.4.  AFCEC/CO  validates  the  new  requirements  with  AFLCMC  for  budgeting  and procurement. 3.1.5.  Upon approval of the AFEMS request, installation-level personnel  should requisition the  system  and  any  other  components  not  included  in  the  government-supplied  equipment (GSE) kit, such as the pendant. 3.2.  Project Installation Requirements. 3.2.1.  The  BCE's  AAS  representative  will  review  the  construction  drawings  and  contract specifications  at  the  35  percent  and  65  percent  completion  stages  and  approve  at  the  90 percent  design  completion  phase.    MAJCOM  AAS  managers  will  also  provide  technical reviews at design milestones.  (T-2) Other entities with a stake in the project, such as SE and A3  at  base  and  MAJCOM  levels,  should  also  be  asked  to  review  the  project  drawings  and contract  specifications.  The  BCE's  representative  also  ensures  that  installation  contracts stipulate: 3.2.1.1.  The construction superintendent, project engineer, or other authority experienced in installing AAS is onsite during construction and installation of each system. 3.2.1.2.  The  contractor  corrects  any  deficiencies  in  the  installation  until  at  least  two pullouts  of  the  purchase  tape  are  accomplished  in  each  direction  of  intended  operation, with the BCE’s AAS representative present, and the contracting officer officially accepts the system. 3.3.  Grandfathered Systems.  On-grade BAK-12 systems installed before 1 July 1977, that are sited  at  least  76.2  meters  (250  feet)  from  the  runway  centerline  do  not  have  to  be  relocated  to meet  the  minimum  setback  requirement  of  84  meters  (275  feet)  from  the  runway  centerline; however,  all  systems  equipped  with  2-roller  edge  sheaves  or  2-roller  fairlead  beams  must  be programmed  for  retrofit  with  3-roller  fairlead  beams  or  edge  sheaves  to  eliminate  the longitudinal wheel abutment along the runway shoulder. (T-2) AFI32-1043  4 MARCH 2015   11  3.4.  Installing Systems at Jointly Used Airports. 3.4.1.  The FAA acts for and on behalf of the DOD Service component in operating arresting systems installed at jointly used civil airports for the primary use of US military aircraft. 3.4.2.  Site  arresting  systems  on  civil  airports  jointly  used  by  civil  and  military  aircraft according  to  FAA  Advisory  Circular  (AC)  150/5220-9,  Aircraft  Arresting  Systems  on  Civil Airports. (T-0) 3.4.3.  To install an arresting system at a jointly used civil airport, the installation commander must first notify the airport manager (or authority) of the need.  (T-1) If the airport manager agrees,  the  installation  commander  submits  the  plan  with  sketches  or  drawings  to  the  Air Force liaison  officer at  the FAA regional  office.  (T-1) Refer any disagreement between the responsible officials to the next higher level within the chain of command. 3.4.4.  If  construction  involves  a  lease  agreement  that  does  not  allow  placing  additional structures on the leased premises, contact the MAJCOM. 3.4.5.  Third-party  claims  presented  for  damage,  injury,  or  death  resulting  from  FAA operation  of  the  system  for  military  aircraft  or  from  the  Air  Force  or  Air  National  Guard maintenance  of  the  system  may  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Air  Force.  Process  such  claims under  the  appropriate  Air  Force  regulatory  guidance  (AFI  51-502,  Personnel  and Government Recovery Claims). 3.4.6.  The  FAA  is  responsible  for  claims  presented  for  damage  resulting  from  FAA operation  of  the  system  for  civil  aircraft;  therefore,  separate  agreements  between  DOD  and FAA concerning liability for such damage are not necessary. 3.4.7.  The MAJCOM negotiates the operational agreement with FAA for a jointly used civil airport.  The  MAJCOM  may  delegate  this  authority  to  the  installation  commander.  The agreement  describes  FAA  functions  and  responsibilities  concerning  the  remote-control operation of arresting systems by FAA air traffic controllers. 3.5.  Military  Rights  Agreements  for  Foreign  Locations  and  Use  by  Non-US  Government Aircraft. 3.5.1.  Install  these  systems  under  the  military  rights  agreement  with  the  host  government. The installation commander coordinates any separate agreements required with the local US diplomatic representative and negotiates the agreement with the host nation. If the parties are unable to agree, refer the issue to the MAJCOM. 3.5.2.  In  an  emergency,  the  pilot  of  a  non-US  Government  aircraft  may  request  and  use arresting systems at Air Force bases and jointly used airports within the continental US and overseas.   12  AFI32-1043  4 MARCH 2015 Chapter 4 TYPICAL ARRESTING SYSTEM AND BARRIER CONFIGURATIONS, AND DECOMMISSIONING 4.1.  Configurations.  The primary mission aircraft dictates the total number, type, and location of  AAS  required.  The  MAJCOM  owning  the  tailhook-equipped  aircraft  (or  aircraft  compatible with  net  barrier  systems)  can  determine  through  operational  risk  management  (ORM),  runway configuration,  proximity  to  other  airfields,  and  other  factors,  that  the  typical  configuration  of both  a  runway  and  overrun  system  may  not  be  required.  Use  the  following  examples  for guidance. 4.1.1.  A  runway  intended  primarily  for  operating  tactical  or  training  tailhook-equipped aircraft  should  typically  have  an  emergency  system  in  each  overrun  and  an  operational system at  each end of the runway for redundant  capability. However,  for some locations at forward  operating  bases  or  where  snow  and  ice  accumulation  warrants,  two  operational systems  may  be  necessary  for  each  runway  end  and  a  midfield  installation  may  also  be needed. 4.1.2.  Runways  that  are  prime  divert  facilities  for  bases  operating  tactical  or  training tailhookequipped  aircraft  should  have  an  emergency  system  in  each  overrun  and  an operational system on each end of the primary runway. 4.1.3.  Bases that are occasional hosts to arrestment-capable transient aircraft should have an emergency system installed in each overrun of the primary runway or an operational system on each end of the primary runway. 4.2.  Decommissioning.  If  the  mission  or  mission  aircraft  assigned  to  an  installation  does  not require  an  AAS  complex  and  removal  will  not  have  an  impact  on  other  Air  Force  activities, consider decommissioning. Decommissioning procedures are as follows: 4.2.1.  Upon  notification  of  a  proposed  AAS  decommissioning,  the  owning  MAJCOM/A7 will  notify  AF/A4CS  and  AFCEC/COSC  of  the  intent  to  decommission.  AF/A4CS  will notify AF/A3/5,  requesting they solicit comments on impact  of decommissioning to  overall Air Force aviation operations. AF/A3/5 will task ACC/A3, as the Combat Air Forces (CAF) lead  command, the  proposed decommissioning (see paragraph 1.1.3). to  provide  a  recommendation  on through  AF/A3O 4.2.2.  In developing the recommendation, ACC will solicit inputs from its A3, A5, and A7 functional  areas.  ACC  Flight  Operations  Division  (ACC/A3T)  will  be  the  OPR  for  this review. 4.2.3.  ACC/A3T will solicit inputs from ACC and other MAJCOMs’ and Services’ staffs on impact to their operations by the AAS decommissioning. 4.2.4.  ACC,  as  the  CAF  lead  command,  will  determine  if  suitable  and  sufficient  alternate landing locations for tailhook-equipped aircraft are available if the AAS is decommissioned. AFI32-1043  4 MARCH 2015   13  4.2.5.  After  a  thorough  review,  ACC/A3T,  through  the  ACC/A3,  will  provide  a recommendation with supporting data to AF/A3O. 4.2.6.  AF/A3O will review the recommendations in coordination with AF/A4C and provide a consolidated recommendation to AF/A3/5 and AF/A4. 4.3.  Decommissioning  Considerations.  As  a  minimum,  the  following  areas/subjects  shall  be considered by Headquarters Air Force decommissioning: 4.3.1.  Review  operation  plans  (OPLAN),  memorandums  of  understanding  (MOU), memorandums of agreement (MOA), letters of agreement (LOA), and contingency plans to identify, then coordinate AAS decommissioning with all flying units (e.g., active duty, ANG, AFRC,  other  Services)  that  currently  use  the  airfield  for  emergency  diverts,  routine  local training,  en  route  stop  for  deployments,  hurricane  evacuation  (HURREVAC)  base,  daily operations, etc. 4.3.2.  The focus of the review should be the effect on CAF tailhook-equipped aircraft using the base. 4.3.3.  Coordinate with the pertinent MAJCOM strategic basing division/branch (A5 or A8) to determine impact on known basing initiatives. 4.3.4.  Determine any funding constraints in keeping the AAS operational. 4.3.5.  Determine sourcing for funds to keep the AAS operational, if necessary. 4.3.6.  ACC/A3T (or equivalent) will contact all CAF operations groups within 150 nautical miles (NM) of the closing AAS to determine any expected impact to base flight operations. 4.3.7.  Coordinate  with  the  pertinent  MAJCOM/A3  to  determine  impact  on  higher headquarters missions. 4.3.8.  If  located  on  a  joint-use  field,  coordinate  with  local  airfield  management  and/or  the FAA. 4.4.  Decommissioning Actions.  If decommissioning is approved then: 4.4.1.  ACC/A3T  (or  equivalent)  will  notify  the  host  Airfield  Manager,  who  will  in  turn submit the appropriate NOTAM and FLIP revision. 4.4.2.  The  responsible  MAJCOM  and  base  will  program,  prioritize,  and  fund  a  project  to remove  all  AAS  structures  (such  as  barrier  shacks)  and  other  supporting  infrastructure (including  abandoned  concrete  foundations  no  longer  serving  an  operational  requirement, any ultra-high-molecular-weight [UHMW] polyethylene panels, and any subsurface BAK-14 and Type H hook cable systems).   Additionally, the project must restore the area to grading standards  to  meet  criteria  in  UFC  3-260-01,  Airfield  and  Heliport  Planning  and  Design,  in the  runway  mandatory  frangibility  zone  (Airfield  Obstruction  Reduction  Initiative  [AORI] Priority  Area  1)  to  eliminate  any  hazardous  violations.  The  BCE  shall  ensure  the  real property records are updated when the AAS has been removed. (T-1).   14  AFI32-1043  4 MARCH 2015 4.4.3.  Equipment  disposition  instructions  should  be  requested  from  the  AAS  item  manager (AFLCMC/WNZCA)  using  AFTO  Form  375,  Selected  Support  Equipment  Repair  Cost Estimate.  Equipment  should  be  removed  from  the  base's  Custody  Authorization/Custody Receipt  Listing  (CA/CRL)  and  Allowance  Standard  (AS)  after  disposition  instructions  are provided by the item manager.

When multiple runways are used, they are all considered active runways. Aircraft Arresting Barrier—A device, not dependent on an aircraft arresting hook, used to stop an  aircraft  by  absorbing  its  forward  momentum  in  an  emergency  landing  or  aborted  takeoff. (Joint Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms) Aircraft  Arresting  Cable—The  part  of  an  aircraft  arresting  system  (AAS)  that  spans  the runway surface or flight  deck landing area and is engaged by the aircraft arresting hook. (Joint Publication 1-02) (Also see "Pendant.") Aircraft Arresting Complex—An airfield layout comprising one or more arresting systems. Aircraft  Arresting  System  (AAS)—A  series  of  components  used  to  engage  and  absorb  the forward momentum of a routine or emergency landing or an aborted takeoff. (Joint Publication 1-02) Arrestment-Capable  Aircraft—An  aircraft  whose  flight  manual  specifies  arrestment procedures. Cycle  Time—A  measure  of  time  between  engagement  of  an  aircraft  and  the  point  when  the arresting system is certified fully operational and ready for another engagement. Effective  Pendant  Height  (EPH)—The  vertical  distance  in  inches  from  the  underside  of  the pendant cable to a projected surface representing undamaged runway surface. Energy Absorber—The component of the arresting system that dissipates the kinetic energy of the arrested aircraft. Location  Identification—A  description  identifying  the  location  of  arresting  systems  by  the approach or departure end, runway designation, and position in hundreds of meters/feet from the threshold.  For  example,  the  location  identification  extended  runout  BAK-12  at  +457.2  meters (+1500 feet) on approach runway 36 indicates a 365.7-meter (1200-foot) runout BAK-12 located 457.2 meters (1500 feet) beyond the threshold of runway 36.   20  AFI32-1043  4 MARCH 2015 Missed  Engagement—Any  unsuccessful  attempt  to  engage  an  AAS  hook  cable  with  a successfully deployed aircraft tailhook. Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS)—A self-contained, trailer-mounted BAK-12 AAS that accommodates rapid installation during contingencies. Movement  Area  (USAF/FAA)—The runways, taxiways, and other areas of an airport/heliport used for taxiing/hover taxiing, air taxiing, take-off, and landing of aircraft, exclusive of loading ramps and parking areas. At airports/heliports with a tower, specific approval for entry onto the movement area must be obtained from ATC. For USAF, the movement area is determined by the airfield  operations  flight  commander  and  defined  in  the  installation  airfield  operations  and airfield driving instructions in  accordance with  AFI 13-204V3, Airfield  Operations Procedures and Programs, and AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving. Movement  Area  (ICAO)—That part of an airport used for the take-off, landing and taxiing of aircraft, consisting of the maneuvering area and the apron(s). Overrun (USAF)—An area beyond the take-off runway designated by the airport authorities as able  to  support  an  airplane  during  an  aborted  take-off.  The  FAA/ICAO  term  for  this  is “stopway.” UFC 3-260-01 identifies this area as one that prevents serious damage to aircraft that overrun or undershoot the runway. Pendant—The part of an AAS that spans the runway surface or flight deck landing area and is engaged by the aircraft arresting hook. Reset  Time—The  time  required  to  ready  the  arresting  system  for  another  engagement  after aircraft release. (This does not  include time to  disengage the  aircraft  from  the arresting system but does include the time required to inspect and certify the system as fully operational.) Stopway  (FAA/ICAO)—An  area  beyond  the  take-off  runway  designated  by  the  airport authorities as able to support an airplane during an aborted take-off. The USAF term for this is “overrun.”
