The  potential  for  a  vehicle  to  rollover  increases  for vehicles with a high gross weight (20,000 lbs. or more) or a high center of gravity.  Check the vehicle’s data plate to determine if the vehicle is at higher risk for rollover.  Always ensure the operator and passenger(s) are wearing proper head protection.   5.3.2.1.  Safety steel-toed boots must be worn.  5.3.2.2.  Head protection.  5.3.2.3.  Gloves will be worn during cargo loading and unloading (take off rings/jewelry first.  5.3.2.4.  First aid kit.  5.3.2.5.

When braking, allow a much greater distance to stop.  An armored vehicle can take twice the distance of a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) to stop.  5.4.1.2.  Do not make sharp turns during hard braking. 5.4.1.3.  Armored vehicles can be more than double the weight of a HMMWV and more than three times heavier than a 6-passenger pickup truck.   5.4.2.  Traveling too fast and turning too sharply.   5.4.2.1.  To not exceed safe operating speed based on environmental conditions, vehicle limitations and precautions as listed in the operating manual when negotiating curves.  5.4.3.  Rollover prevention.  Be familiar with rollover prevention data for the armored vehicle being operated:  Approach angle, departure angle, center of gravity, maximum side slope (hard and soft surfaces).  5.4.4.  Rollover risk procedures.  The senior occupant will ensure that all personnel are checked for injuries and that injured personnel are given the appropriate medical attention.  Report the accident immediately, along with the injury report.  5.4.4.1.   Driver.  Release the accelerator.  Keep hands on steering wheel with extended, but not locked, arms.  Tuck head into chest and brace for impact and yell, “ROLLOVER.” 5.4.4.2.   Passenger(s).  Tuck head into chest and brace for impact.  Plant feet firmly on the floor while holding onto a stationary object.  Yell, “ROLLOVER.” 5.4.4.3.   Gunner.  Drop down.  Tuck head into chest and brace for impact.  Plant feet firmly on the floor while holding onto a stationary object.  Yell, “ROLLOVER.” Note:  Gunners when operating the turret, limit body protrusion not to exceed name tag. 5.4.5.  Use caution on all wet and snowy roads.  See AFMAN 24-306 for additional guidance on vehicle operation for varying road conditions. 5.4.6.  Off-road driving.  For more information on off-road driving and safe vehicle operation guidance, refer to AFMAN 24-306.       5.4.7.  Tire Changing Safety.  5.4.7.1.  If not done correctly, it can cause serious injury to personnel, as well as damage to the vehicle.  5.4.7.2.  Ensure that the vehicle is on a level surface and that wheels are chocked prior to lifting the vehicle.  5.4.7.3.  Due to the vehicles heavy weight, tire changes can only be done with the vehicle issued jack, jack stands and tire tools.  5.4.7.4.  If pneumatic tools will be used, gloves, eye protection and hearing protection are required.  5.4.7.5.  These tires are extremely heavy and it will more than likely require two or three people to remove the spare tire and put the flat back in its place.  5.4.8.  Backing. 5.4.7.6.  Ensure tire pressures are checked before each use.  5.4.7.7.  Tires are extremely heavy since they are equipped with run flat inserts.  Tires need to be torqued as soon as possible after changing.   5.4.8.1.  Minimize the need for backing.  5.4.8.2.  Always use a spotter when backing.  The operator must maintain visual contact with the spotter at all times.  If visual contact is lost, the operator must immediately stop the vehicle.  See AFMAN 24-306 for additional guidance on spotter safety and for AF standard spotter hand signals.   Note:   Tactical  environments may prevent the use of  a spotter.  5.5. Vehicle Operation.  5.5.1.  Prepare to take control.  5.5.1.1.  Adjust the driver’s seat before operating the vehicle. 5.5.1.2.  Check/adjust all mirrors for maximum visibility before operating vehicle.  5.5.1.3.  Must be in control of the vehicle at all times. 5.5.2.  Start the engine. 5.5.2.1.  Glow plug preheat.       5.5.2.1.1.   Diesel engines are equipped with glow plugs instead of spark plugs.  Glow plugs must be allowed to heat up prior to starting the vehicle. 5.5.2.1.2.   Turn the key to the on position and look for the glow plug indicator light (two curly pig tails) on the instrument cluster.  When the light goes out it is safe to start the vehicle.  Note:  If the glow plugs are not allowed to heat up, permanent damage can occur.  5.5.2.2.  Check the instrument panel.   5.5.4.  4WD operation. 5.5.3.  Visibility.    Ensure  the  vehicle  is  seen.    Turn  on  the  headlights  when  operating  the armored vehicle. 5.5.4.1.  Do  not  operate  4WD  on  hard,  dry  surfaces,  as  this  can  cause  damage  and dangerous driving conditions.  5.5.4.2.   Some vehicles are equipped with Electronic Shift on Fly (ESOF), and therefore hubs will not need to be locked.  Proper use of ESOF can be found in the operator’s manual. 5.5.5.  Cruise control.  Do not use in icy conditions, rain, low visibility conditions, dangerous road conditions, etc.        5.5.6.  Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). 5.5.6.1.  Exhaust filter installed to reduce carbon emissions by trapping exhaust particles prior to the tailpipe.  When DPF is nearly full the “Drive to Clean Exhaust Filter” light will be displayed in the instrument cluster.  5.5.6.2.   When this occurs the driver will need to drive the vehicle above 30 mph for about an hour until the light goes out.  If this is not done, the engine will go into reduced power mode until the filter is cleaned.  5.5.7.  Speed limits. 5.5.7.1.  Speed limits will be established locally not to exceed 65 mph. 5.5.7.2.  Speed limits need to be reasonable and prudent and should be established for both improved and unimproved surfaces.  5.5.8.  Spot light (if applicable). 5.5.8.1.

If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move.  If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. Set parking brake (power unit only). Place vehicle into a low gear. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. Any unusual brake pedal "feel" or delayed stopping action can mean trouble. If the trainee finds anything unsafe during the Vehicle inspection, get it fixed. Federal and state laws forbid operating an unsafe vehicle. Check vehicle operation regularly: Instruments. Pressure gauges. Ammeter/voltmeter. Mirrors. Tires. If the trainee sees, hears, smells, or feels anything that might mean trouble, he/she should check it out. Safety inspection. Document any discrepancy on AF Form 1800.  Sign-off AF Form 1800 to signify accomplishment of inspection.
