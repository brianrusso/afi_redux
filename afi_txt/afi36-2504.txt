Program Objectives. A promotion is not a reward for past service. It is advancement to a highergrade based on past performance and future potential. An officer’s first consideration for promotion willbe far enough in advance so that, if recommended for promotion and on an approved selection list, theofficer’s promotion will occur on or before the date the officer reaches the maximum time in grade. How-ever, during the transition period, officers must also meet the total years service date requirement (seeparagraph 2.2.). Specific objectives:2.1.1.  Promote officers of the desired quality and quantity through a fair and equitable competitiveselection system that advances those individuals considered by boards as best qualified.2.1.2.  Promote officers in sufficient numbers of each grade, as vacancies occur, to maintain thestrength in each grade for each competitive category.2.1.3.  Provide reasonably stable, consistent, and visible career opportunities for each competitive cat-egory.2.2.  Transition Period. The ROPMA law establishes a 5 year transition period to phase-in the promo-tion criteria outlined in the new law. The transition period is 1 October 1996 through 30 September 2001.The time frame is established to allow implementation of all the provisions of the law with as little nega-tive impact as possible.2.2.1.  TYSD. The ANG and USAFR will gradually phase out the Total Years Service Date (TYSD)eligibility requirement of ROPA during the Transition Period. See Table 2.1. for specific criteria. 2.2.2.  TIG for promotion to Captain. During the transition period, the USAFR will use 4 yearstime-in-grade (TIG) to establish eligibility for promotion consideration to the grade of captain. Afterthe transition, TIG will change to 5 years. The Air National Guard will use 5 years during this transi-tion period unless otherwise announced. 2.3.  Promoting USAFR Second Lieutenants. (For ANG officers, see ANGI 36-2504.) Second lieutenantson the RASL are eligible for promotion and are normally promoted after completing 2 years of servicestarting from their Date of Rank (DOR) as a second lieutenant. If found NOT Qualified for Promotion(NQP) or a delay is warranted, see Chapter 7. Where there is an unintended delay in an officer’s promo-tion to first lieutenant by reason of administrative error supporting review as determined by ARPC/CC,ARPC/CC may adjust the officer’s date of rank and effective date on which it would otherwise have beeneffective. Note: Chaplain Candidates, Legal Interns, and Health Professions Scholarship Program Partici-pants are ineligible for promotion while in these programs. 2.4.  Eligibility Criteria and Restrictions. The following criteria are restriction apply for promotions togrades of captain through lieutenant colonel (ANGUS) through colonel (USAFR) Promotion Eligibility. 2.4.1.  An officer must be currently on the RASL when the board convenes. Additionally, the officermust have been on the RASL or the active duty list (ADL) or a combination of these for 1 year beforethe board convenes.AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003132.4.2.  An officer, removed from the RASL and later placed back on the RASL, shall have his or herDOR and seniority adjusted to reflect the time spent not on the RASL.2.4.3.  The mandatory promotion board considers eligible officers for promotion to the grades of cap-tain through lieutenant colonel soon enough so that if selected, the IPZ promotion can occur whenthey complete the time in grade as listed in Table 2.1. and Table 2.2. If utilized, Below-the-Promo-tion-Zone (BPZ) promotions are for officers eligible for promotion consideration, but junior to offic-ers’ eligible IPZ and APZ for their competitive category. However, the Reserve of the Air Force willnot consider officers for BPZ promotion. 2.4.4.  A USAFR officer, eligible for promotion consideration to colonel, must complete 3 or moreyears time in grade by 30 September of the calendar year in which the board convenes. For promotionof ANGUS officers to the grade of colonel, see NGR (AF) 36-4.2.4.5.  To be promoted, a selected officer must remain on the RASL until their date of rank (DOR)unless the officer transfers to the ADL. If the officer transfers to the ADL before DOR, the officer isstill promoted on the DOR. An officer's promotion becomes void if a selected officer receives anassignment to the Inactive Status List Reserve Section (ISLRS) or to the Retired Reserve before theDOR. In this case, no promotion occurs until reconsideration and selection of the officer by anotherpromotion board.2.4.6.  An officer may not have a projected removal from the RASL that falls within 90 days after theconvening date of the board. Waivers may be granted, for lieutenant colonels only, on a case-by-casebasis. Lieutenant colonels desiring a waiver submit a letter to HQ ARPC/DPJ to arrive not later than60 days before the board convening date. Since the PRF must accompany the waiver letter for theapplication to be processed, provide the letter to the MPF to accompany the PRF to HQ ARPC. Onceapproved, the officer will be notified of eligibility to meet the Colonel Promotion Board.2.4.7.  MAJCOMs and MPFs identify eligible officers using "Reports Processing" in the PRISMinformation system. They will notify the commanders of officers identified as eligible for promotionconsideration.2.4.8.  All officers eligible for promotion consideration to the grade of lieutenant colonel and USAFRofficers eligible for consideration to the grade of colonel will have an AF Form 709, Promotion Rec-ommendation (PRF) completed and submitted to the selection board. Each board announcement let-ter, sent prior to selection boards, will include specific instructions for completing the PRF.2.4.9.  ANG/DP gives HQ ARPC/DPJA a list of all ANGUS candidates ineligible for each promotionboard.2.4.10.  HQ ARPC/DPJA screens all identified candidates to verify eligibility for promotion consider-ation.2.4.11.  Officers who voluntarily remain on LEAD for subsequent tours, will be transferred to theADL at the three-year and one day point and compete for promotion under DOPMA provisions(ADL) when they meet the established promotion eligibility criteria. LEAD officers who desire toremain promotion eligible under ROPMA provisions (RASL) must return to the AFR/ANG for a min-imum of one year prior to returning to LEAD. Officers who are voluntarily returned to lead before theone-year has expired will have orders generated that are greater than three years, which automaticallyplaces them of the ADL. 14AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 20032.5.

Promotions under this program maintain a balanced force by givingcommanders the means to nominate exceptionally well qualified candidates for promotion to fill vacan-cies in the grades of captain through lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserve.2.5.1.  Immediate supervisors and senior raters base their recommendations on individual merit anddemonstrated potential for service in the higher grade. Officers are not entitled to a PV nominationsimply because they occupy a higher graded position or because of their seniority to any other officer.2.5.2.  PV Boards convene in conjunction with annual promotion boards convened under Title 10U.S.C., Section 14101(a). HQ ARPC/DPJ provides MAJCOMs and the MPFs information on eachPV selection board. MPFs send the information to the units they service.2.6.  Vacancy Determination. For PV promotion nomination to the grade of captain through lieutenantcolonel, the officer must occupy a position with an authorized grade higher than the officer’s currentgrade. Base the vacancy determination on the following criteria.2.6.1.  The position vacancy must be within the nominee’s duty Air Force Specialty (DAFS) (exclud-ing prefix and suffix) in an organization managed by the nominating senior rater.2.6.2.  A position vacancy is defined as within the nominee’s DAFS if the number of officers assignedin the next or higher grades (up to and including lieutenant colonel) is less than the number of officersauthorized in the next or higher grades (up to and including lieutenant colonel). See Attachment 4 forspecifics for each grade.2.6.3.  When determining vacancies within a DAFS, compute authorized and assigned figures sepa-rately for each Reserve category (i.e., Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs), Individual Mobilization Aug-mentees (IMAs), Active Guard Reserve (AGR), traditional unit participants, etc.). Geographicallyseparated units will be considered separately when determining vacancies.2.6.4.  When computing the number of officers assigned by grade to a particular DAFS, do not countofficers who, within 90 days after the board convening date, are either projected for reassignmentfrom the senior rater’s organization or have an established date for removal from the RASL. If theirdate of assignment from the senior rater’s organization or removal from the RASL, is projected to belater than 90 days after the board convening date, count these officers in determining the numberassigned.2.7.  Eligibility Criteria.2.7.1.  First lieutenants, captains, and majors in the Selected Reserve are eligible for PV promotionconsideration when they: 2.7.1.1.  Have an outstanding record, with at least 50 credit points for a year of satisfactory federalservice during the last full retention/retirement (R/R) year. 2.7.1.2.  Complete the required time in grade (see Table 2.1.) by the last day of the month beforethe selection board convenes.2.7.1.3.  Deleted. 2.7.2.  Officers nominated for PV promotion must occupy, or be reassigned to, the position for whichnominated at the time of submission of the PRF. To receive the promotion, the officer must beAFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 200315assigned to the position for which nominated, at the time of the public release of the board’s results.See paragraph 2.9. for the exception.2.7.2.1.  The unit in which the vacancy exists cannot be scheduled for deactivation within 1 yearof the board's convening date.2.7.2.2.  The position must be authorized at a higher grade than the nominee’s current grade. Thegrade must not be lowered and the position must remain on the Unit Manning Document (UMD)and be funded for at least one year from the board’s convening date. 2.7.3.  Are recommended by their senior rater on a PRF.2.7.4.  The nominee must be the incumbent (not a UMD overage) in the position for which nominated.2.8.  Identifying Eligible Officers. All MPFs identify officers tentatively eligible for PV nominationusing “Reports Processing” in PRISM. They in turn, will notify the commanders of officers identified astentatively eligible.2.9.  Ineligible Officers. An officer is ineligible for promotion consideration or PV promotion if theofficer:2.9.1.  Is retired (see AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements). 2.9.2.  Deleted. 2.9.3.  Is currently on a mandatory promotion list or eligible for consideration by a mandatory board(IPZ). Was considered by a mandatory Reserve of the Air Force (ResAF) captain, major, or lieutenantcolonel selection board, but not recommended for promotion (the officer cannot be once passed overfor promotion and then nominated for PV promotion to the same grade as passed over).2.9.4.  Declined a ResAF promotion to captain, major, or lieutenant colonel (the officer cannot declinea promotion and then be nominated for PV promotion to the same grade).2.9.5.  Was removed from a ResAF promotion recommendation list, for promotion to the same grade,by a propriety of promotion action.2.9.6.  Was selected for PV promotion but, subsequently reassigned from the position for which nom-inated on the PRF on or before the public release date of the results of the selection board. EXCEP-TION: Any officer who is reassigned from the position for which nominated, with an EDCSA prior topublic release date, may retain the PV promotion as long as the new position is at least one gradehigher than their current grade, the criteria in paragraph 2.7. are met, and both the gaining and losingsenior rater concur with the PV promotion. The gaining senior rater will forward a letter of concur-rence to HQ ARPC/DPJ before public release.2.9.7.  Is coded as an UMD overage.NOTE: Do not backdate a reassignment for a promotion. If the nominated officer’s position is redesig-nated due to reorganization, the officer is still eligible for promotion. The grade authorization, AFSC, andduties must remain the same. MAJCOM manpower personnel must confirm the position's transfer if theposition control number changes. If position control numbers change for officers nominated for PV pro-motion, AFRC unit commanders must report these changes to the MPF. MPFs notify HQ ARPC/DPJA asquickly as possible, in writing, before the board convenes. 16AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 20032.10.  Nominating Officers To Fill Vacancies. Nominate an officer to fill only one vacancy. Nominateonly one officer per vacancy. NOTE: Identify a vacancy by its position control number.2.10.1.  The official recommending a PV promotion notifies the officer of the recommendation. Theofficer may then request an officer preselection brief (OPB) through the servicing MPF.2.10.2.  Senior raters complete a PRF to nominate an eligible officer for PV promotion. The seniorrater may take recommendations from the officer’s supervisor for inclusion on the PRF. Boardannouncement letters, sent before each selection board, will include specific instructions for comple-tion of the PRF.2.10.3.  HQ ARPC/DPJA must receive the completed PRF not later than 60 calendar days before theboard convening date.2.10.4.  HQ ARPC/DPJA verifies that each recommended officer is eligible. HQ ARPC/DPJA returnsrecommendations to the servicing MPF for ineligible officers.2.10.5.  The senior rater submitting the recommendation must notify HQ ARPC/DPJA, in writing, asquickly as possible, when changes occur before the date of rank (DOR). These changes include when: 2.10.5.1.  The officer becomes ineligible.2.10.5.2.  The officer becomes unavailable to fill the vacancy.2.10.5.3.  The Air Force eliminates the position.2.10.5.4.  The position is downgraded or deleted from the UMD.Table 2.1.

Convening of Selection Boards. Whenever needed, the SAF will convene a selection board to rec-ommend officers for promotion to the next higher grade, for consideration for continuation, or selectiveearly removal from active status.3.1.1.  Mandatory Promotion Boards. The numbers of officers In- and Above-the-Promotion-Zone (I/APZ) are based on the projected needs of the Air Force, within each competitive category, over thenext 5 years. It also includes the number of officers who require consideration before reaching theirmaximum time in grade (see Table 2.1. and Table 2.2.).3.1.2.  Position Vacancy Promotion (PV) Boards. The number of officers selected in each competitivecategory for a PV promotion depend on the number of positions vacant and the number of officersboth best and fully qualified for promotion, out of the officers nominated for promotion.3.1.3.  Continuation Boards. Convening of continuation boards is based solely on the needs of the AirForce for retaining officers in a specific AFSC for a specific period of time. When necessary, SAFwill establish a quota of officers eligible for continuation. To be eligible for consideration by a contin-uation board, an officer must be twice deferred for promotion to the next higher grade or the officerreaches the maximum time in service for their grade (lieutenant colonel and colonel). Additionally,the officer must make application for consideration when offered the opportunity to apply.3.1.4.  Selective Early Removal Boards. Whenever the SAF determines there are too many officers ina specific grade and competitive category with at least 30 years of commissioned service or 20 yearsof satisfactory federal service for retirement, the SAF may convene a board to recommend officers forremoval from the RASL.3.2.  Selection Board Composition. The SAF ensures that board membership consists of at least five ormore officers who are senior in grade to the eligible officers. Divide selection boards consisting of morethan five officers into panels of at least five officers each, to enable the board to complete its work in areasonable time. Panels are subdivisions of the board and will have as broad a representation of MAJ-COMs, career areas and aeronautical ratings as possible.3.2.1.  At least half the selection board membership must be ResAF officers not on the active duty list(ADL). At least one officer from each component (active duty, ANG, USAFR), and one officer fromeach competitive category considered must be part of the board membership.NOTE: For promotion to ANGUS Colonel, only ANG and active duty officers comprise the selectionboard. For promotion to USAFR Colonel, only USAFR and active duty officers comprise the selectionboard.3.2.2.  A selection board need not include an officer from a competitive category if no officer of thatcompetitive category on the RASL or ADL holds a permanent grade higher than the grade of the offic-ers considered by the board. However, in such a case, the SAF may appoint as a member of the boarda retired officer of that competitive category who holds a higher grade than the grade of the officersunder consideration.AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003193.2.3.  No officer may serve on two consecutive boards for promotion to the same competitive cate-gory and grade if the second board will consider any officer considered and not selected by the firstboard.3.2.4.  Selection board membership will reflect the eligible population in terms of minority andwomen officers, MAJCOM of assignment, and component when practical. Even if no females orminorities meet a particular selection board, at least one female or one minority officer will be a mem-ber of each board. 3.2.5.  Large MAJCOMs will not dominate the board membership; ensure reasonable representationof smaller commands over time. Board membership will also contain rated and nonrated officers fromRegular Air Force (RegAF), ANGUS and USAFR (EXCEPTION: No ANGUS representation forReserve Colonel Promotion Board).3.2.6.  Structure board membership for the judge advocate, chaplain and health professions competi-tive categories to ensure no more than two voting members (or less than a majority for a larger board)are from the competitive category under consideration. The remaining voting members will be lineofficers, except for boards considering health professions competitive categories where other votingmembers may be officers from other health professions competitive categories. 3.2.7.  Board members (other than the president and panel chairpersons) for the lieutenant colonel andcolonel boards must be in the grade of colonel. (EXCEPTION: A judge advocate board member maybe a brigadier general.) The panel chairperson for all promotion panels will be a Line of the Air Forceofficer, of the appropriate grade, for the officers under consideration by a board.3.2.8.  The president of the captain board and panel chairpersons for the lieutenant colonel and colonelboards must be in the grade of brigadier general or above. The president of the major, lieutenant colo-nel, and colonel boards must be at least a major general.3.2.9.  The board presidency rotates among RegAF, ANGUS and USAFR for captain, major and lieu-tenant colonel boards, and between RegAF and USAFR for USAFR colonel boards.20AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003Chapter 4  CONDUCTING THE BOARD4.1.

Board recorders will furnish all written communications to all board members and record themas part of the board’s record. 4.5.2.  No one other than the SAF may appear in person to address a selection board on any matter.Should the SAF address a board in person, HQ ARPC/DPJ provides a verbatim transcript of theSAF’s remarks to every board member and includes it in the record of the board. This does not restrictthe staff from furnishing administrative information to the board. Board members, recorders, andadministrative staff may orally communicate routine administrative information to the extent neces-sary to facilitate the board’s work.4.6.  Information Provided to Selection Boards. Selection boards use the following items in their delib-erations.4.6.1.  The name and official record (outlined in AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records System) ofeach eligible officer, including any communication received from that officer, and a factual summaryof the data contained in the officer’s military personnel file (the Officer Selection Brief [OSB]).4.6.2.  Letters submitted to selection boards by eligible officers.4.6.3.  Information not part of the official military personnel record of an officer, but which the SAF(or a civilian official appointed by the President, by and with the advice of the Senate and designatedby the SAF) determines as substantiated and relevant to reasonably and materially affect board delib-erations. The SAF (or designee) must ensure the procedures for identifying and proposing such infor-mation for consideration applies to all eligible officers In- and Above-the-Promotion-Zone, for alleligible officers nominated for consideration for PV Promotion, for continuation and for selectiveearly removal for the board concerned. In these cases the SAF ensures the officer:22AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003Is notified and provided a copy of the information.Is allowed a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments and information.Is provided a factual summary of the information, if it is not totally available for reasons of national security.4.6.4.  Administrative information to amplify or clarify the official military records, instruction andinformation provided to the board. The recorders and administrative staff may provide only informa-tion outlined in AFI 36-2608.4.6.5.  Information described in paragraph 4.6.2., 4.6.3. and 4.6.4. will not meet a subsequent boardunless the information is in the official military personnel record of the officer, or the SAF (or desig-nee) makes a new determination. When rendering a new determination, the officer will have theopportunity to comment upon notification.4.7.  Letters to Selection Boards. Officers eligible for promotion, continuation or selective earlyremoval consideration may send a written communication to the board calling attention to any matter con-cerning themselves that the officer considers important to the officer’s case. Send the letters to HQARPC/DPJA. Letters must have original signatures. HQ ARPC/DPJA will not accept FAX copies for pre-sentation to the selection board. 4.7.1.  The officer submitting the letter must be able to support any statements made in the letter. Theofficer must sign the letter and place their Social Security Number (SSN) below the signature toensure filing the letter in the correct selection folder.4.7.2.  Letters should arrive at least 30 days before the board convenes. Letters must arrive no laterthan 0800 the day the board convenes, for consideration by the board.4.7.3.  HQ ARPC/DPJA destroys letters after the board adjourns. An officer who requests return of theletter must provide a stamped, self-addressed envelope.4.7.4.  The board will not consider letters written by others on behalf of any officer.4.7.5.  Do not attach anything that may become or is already a part of the officer’s record (such as anyPRF, Officer Performance Reports [OPR], or decoration narratives). 4.8.  Scoring Records. Score records on a best-qualified basis unless otherwise directed by SAF.4.8.1.  Base selection on the whole person concept, using evidence of potential to serve in a highergrade.4.8.2.  Base all scores on the following:4.8.2.1.  The material in each officer's official military record.4.8.2.2.  Any information the SAF may provide to that board according to DoD Instruction1320.14.4.8.2.3.  Any information communicated by letter from the officer concerning his or her ownrecord.4.8.3.  Score records by secret ballot, that is, without benefit of discussion, unless a significant dis-agreement (a split; see glossary for definition) occurs in the scores on a particular record. The boardpresident approves requests to discuss records that are not splits. Board members may discuss theirAFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 200323own personal knowledge and evaluation of the professional qualifications of eligible officers as longas they discuss only matters permitted by law, DoD Directive 1320.12, this instruction, or Secretarialguidance and instructions. Board members may not discuss or disclose the opinion of any person nota member of the board concerning the officer unless that opinion is in the material for the board underDoD Instruction 1320.14.4.8.4.  Board members from competitive categories other than the line will not score the records ofofficers of the line competitive category.4.9.  Using the Scoring Scale. Boards will use this scoring scale:10.09.59.08.58.07.57.06.56.0 Absolutely superior Outstanding record Few could be better Strong record Slightly above average Average Slightly below average Well below average Lowest in potential4.9.1.  Score records separately by competitive category; officers within the same competitive cate-gory compete only among themselves for promotion.4.9.2.  Boards or competitive categories with 100 percent selection quotas may use a “yes” or “no”scoring system. A “yes” vote indicates the panel member believes the officer is both fully and bestqualified for promotion. A “no” vote indicates the officer is not fully qualified.4.10.  Conducting Trial Runs. The board recorder provides board members pre-identified records topractice scoring and to illustrate some situations the board may encounter during the actual scoring for therecord. The trial run records will not be actual records of officers being considered by the board.4.10.1.  To the extent practical, the trial run records will be of Reservists representing the broad spec-trum of Reserve categories considered by each board.4.10.2.  After the trial run, board members discuss the records to build on their understanding of theReserve system and to help members assess records they will subsequently score.4.10.3.  The board president makes the determination if a second trial run is needed.4.11.  Resolving Splits. Board members discuss the record involved in the split and may change scores toresolve the split or rescore the record. Only board members with split scores may change their scores inthe process of resolving a split. The board president may send the record of an unresolved split to anotherpanel scoring the same competitive category (if available) or work with the original panel to help resolvethe split. Limit discussion as explained in paragraph 4.8.3.24AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 20034.12.  Establishing the Cut Line. The board recorder or administrative support staff totals the scoresfrom each panel member for each record. List these scores in an order of merit. Panels receive a pro rataportion of the total board quota that corresponds to the total number of records reviewed by the panel. Thepanel applies the quota and ensures the SAF's guidance concerning skill requirements and the consider-ation of special categories of officers is consistent. The board may discuss and rescore the record of anyofficer it determines necessary to give full consideration to the SAF's guidance. Establish a preliminarycut line after initial scoring.4.13.  Resolving the Gray Area. Board members rescore the records of all officers in the gray area untila preliminary cut line falls between officers having different scores.4.14.  Establishing a Recommended List.4.14.1.  Officers above the preliminary cut line will comprise a tentative recommended list.4.14.2.  All board members for each competitive category review the records at the final cut line tocertify the officers are both best and fully qualified for promotion, continuation or selective earlyremoval.4.14.3.  Board members will remove from the tentative recommended list any officer not fully quali-fied for promotion, continuation or selective early removal, as determined by the board. The boardrecommends the remaining officers to the SAF.4.15.  Identifying "Show Cause" Records. Board members identify officers considered by the boardwhose records, in the opinion of a majority of the voting members, indicate the officers must "showcause" for retention on the RASL.4.16.  Disclosing Board Recommendations. Before signing the board report, board participants mayonly disclose board recommendations or proceedings to board participants designated in writing by SAF.4.16.1.  After the signing of the board report, only the recommendations of the board will be dis-closed.4.16.2.  HQ ARPC/DPJ will determine the Public Release date of results after approval of the boardreport.4.17.  Preparing Board Reports. The board, with the recorders' assistance, prepares a written report tothe SAF on its proceedings. The board report will include the name of any officer the board determinesmust “show cause” for retention on active status. Each board member and recorder signs the report certi-fying: 4.17.1.  To the best of the board member’s knowledge, they complied with DoDI 1320.14 for promo-tion boards.4.17.2.  To the best of the board member’s knowledge, they complied with SAF guidance for contin-uation and selective early removal boards.4.17.3.  They were not subject to, or aware of, any censure, reprimand, or admonishment about therecommendations of the board or the exercise of any lawful function within the authorized discretionof the board.AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003254.17.4.  They were not subject to, or aware of, any attempt to coerce or influence improperly, anyaction in the formulation of the board’s recommendations.4.17.5.  They were not party to, or aware of, any attempt at unauthorized communications.4.17.6.  That, to the best of their knowledge, the board reviewed the records of each officer whosename was furnished to the board.4.17.7.  That the officers recommended for promotion are, in the opinion of the majority of the boardmembers, fully qualified and best qualified to meet the needs of the Air Force among those officerswhose names were furnished to the board.4.17.8.  That officers recommended for continuation or selective early removal from the RASL do, inthe opinion of the board members, meet SAF requirements and the needs of the Air Force amongthose officers whose names were furnished to the board.26AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003Chapter 5  POST-BOARD ACTIONS5.1.  Approving Board Reports. The SAF reviews the report and ensures the board acted within the law,applicable directives, and Secretarial guidelines and processes the report according to Title 10 U.S.C.,Section 14110 and Section 14111. If the SAF determines the board acted contrary to law, instruction,DoD Directives, DoD Instructions or guidelines, he or she will return the board report for further proceed-ings with a written explanation for returning it, as authorized by Title 10 U.S.C., Section 14110. The SAFmay then modify, withdraw, or supplement the initial instructions as a part of that written explanation.The board will conduct proceedings necessary to revise the report to correct deficiencies and will resub-mit the report to the SAF. The SAF forwards promotion board results to President, for final approval. Forpromotion to the grade of colonel and above, the appropriate authority must obtain the advice and consentof the Senate. The SAF will approve results and proceedings for continuation and selective early removalboards.5.2.  Board Recorders’ Responsibilities.  5.2.1.  Collect all score rosters, internal working papers, etc., and ensure board members do not retainany board documents.5.2.2.  Destroy all score rosters and internal working papers associated with the board not part of theboard report. Do not do this until approval of the board results.5.2.3.  Identify and retain five benchmark records (provided there are enough records) from among thelowest scoring selects and five benchmark records from among the highest scoring nonselects. 5.3.  Promotion Secretariat Division Responsibilities (HQ ARPC/DPJ) .5.3.1.  Prepares board reports as specified in DoD Directive 1320.12, Enclosure 6 and specific guid-ance provided by SAF for selection boards. Includes in the board report for SAF review the race/eth-nic profile data of the population considered by selection boards for promotion to major, lieutenantcolonel and colonel (all competitive categories).5.3.2.  Establishes the public release date for the promotion, continuation and selective early removallists after approval of the board reports.5.4.  Releasing Board Information. HQ ARPC/DPJ releases only the recommendations of the board. Donot disclose board proceedings, including specific information on how the board scored each record, toany individual not a member of the board, except as required for the official processing of board results.Release information on the number of officers considered and selected, board organization, the generalprocedures followed by the board, the number of board members and their names, grades, and servicecomponents. Disclose a selection board member’s recommendations only in accordance with law, DoDInstruction 1320.14, and in the case of continuation or selective early removal boards, SAF guidance.5.5.  Removing an Officer from a Board Report. If the SAF or the SecDef recommends removing anofficer from a board report (Title 10 U.S.C., Section 14111) and the recommendation includes informa-tion not presented to the board, make the information available to the officer. The authority to remove anofficer from a board report rests with the President. The officer will have a reasonable opportunity to sub-AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 200327mit comments on the information to the officials making and reviewing the recommendation. If theofficer cannot have access to the information for reasons of national security, provide the officer, to themaximum extent possible, an appropriate summary of the information.5.6.  Announcing Board Results. Following approval of the Selection List, HQ ARPC/DPJ will transmitthe board results to the ANGRC, each MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, the Adjutant General of each state, andMPFs. Each organization removes the list of nonselects and SSNs of selected officers before publiclyreleasing the identities of the officers selected. The organization provides the list of nonselects to the com-manders for their action.5.7.  Notifying Officers Selected for Promotion. See Attachment 6 for sample notification.

The letter must arrive at HQ ARPC/DPJA 2 business days before the pro-posed DOR. See also paragraph 6.5. 5. HQ USAF/REP makes USAFR colonel promotions incrementally. 6. Example: A first lieutenant with a DOR of 15 Mar 93, is not selected by the FY98 Captain Pro-motion  Board.  The  officer  meets  the  FY99  Captain  Promotion  Board  and  is  selected.  Theofficer’s DOR to captain is 1 October 1998, the first of October of the Fiscal Year of the board. 7. Calculate the officer’s date as if selected (using the eligibility criteria based on the officer’s ser-vice dates) by a Reserve of the Air Force Selection Board. However, at no time will the date besooner than the date of the officer’s transfer to the RASL. Also, see paragraph 6.5. AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 200333Chapter 6  PROMOTION SPECIAL ISSUES6.1.  Missing Officers. Consider and promote missing officers eligible for promotion along with all otherofficers. "Missing status" includes: Missing.Missing in action.Interned in a foreign country.Captured.Beleaguered. Besieged by a hostile force.Detained in a foreign country against the officer's will.6.2.  Posthumous Promotions. Officers on a select list, who die while on the RASL, are eligible toreceive a Posthumous Promotion. The commander sends a priority message (MINIMIZE included)including the information listed below through the MPF, to HQ ARPC/DPJA, with information copy toMAJCOM, FOA, or DRU. The request must include the date of death and the circumstances of death. HQARPC/DPJ will process the promotion order and send the published promotion order to the immediatecommander. The commander will present the order to the next of kin. Notify ANGUS officers per NGR(AF) 36-4. No financial benefits may accrue as a result of a posthumous promotion. Commanders must:Process the request for a posthumous promotion as soon as possible after the death. State that the officer was on a select list for promotion (captain through colonel), as of the date of death. State that a promotion propriety action was not in effect against the officer.6.3.  Requirement for Baccalaureate Degree. After 30 September 1995, no officer will receive a pro-motion above the grade of first lieutenant, or be federally recognized in a grade above first lieutenant,unless the officer has earned his/her baccalaureate degree at a qualifying institution. The officer will beconsidered by a selection board, but will not be selected for promotion unless either of the followingapplies. 6.3.1.  The officer was appointed or assigned for service in a health profession not requiring a bacca-laureate degree for original commission.6.3.2.  The officer was appointed or federally recognized in the grade of captain before 1 October1995.6.4.  Transfer of Promotion from the ADL to the RASL.  Any officer selected for promotion to ahigher grade, who transfers from the ADL to the RASL of the same armed force, will receive their promo-tion providing the officer remains in the same competitive category. The officer’s DOR on the RASL iscalculated using the current Reserve of the Air Force requirements for IPZ promotions for the officer’scompetitive category. HQ ARPC/DPJ will award a DOR based on the calculation (see Table 5.2.). NOTE:Officers must notify HQ ARPC/DPJ to receive further instructions.34AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 20036.5.  Accelerated Promotion. An officer, on a promotion list as a result of selection for promotion by amandatory promotion board (I/APZ or active duty selection - 10 U.S.C. Chapter 36), may be promoted atany time to fill a vacant position6.5.1.  The position and the officer must meet the same vacancy requirements as the PV program, asoutlined in Chapter 2. 6.5.1.1.  Deleted. 6.5.1.2.  Deleted. 6.5.1.3.  Deleted. 6.5.1.4.  Deleted. 6.5.1.5.  Deleted. 6.5.1.6.  Deleted.6.5.2.  The commander will complete a letter requesting the accelerated promotion of a selectedofficer (see Attachment 5). The commander will send the letter to the officer’s senior rater forendorsement. The senior rater will forward the completed letter to HQ ARPC/DPJA, who will verifyeligibility and initiate the promotion order. 6.5.3.  The letter requesting accelerated promotion must contain a recommended DOR. This date canbe no earlier than the public release date (if the officer is in the position at that time), or the date theofficer is placed in the higher graded position (after public release date). 6.5.4.  The letter requesting the accelerated promotion of a selected officer must arrive at HQ ARPC/DPJA 2 business days before the proposed DOR. This allows publication of the order prior to the pro-motion.6.5.5.  Accelerated promotion for USAFR AGRs must also follow the procedures outlined in para-graph 6.6. HQ AFRC/DPMO will publish the appropriate orders.6.6.  Promotion Procedures for USAFR AGRs. All HQ AGR officers selected for promotion to thegrade of colonel and below must obtain approval from AF/RE before the officer can assume the highergrade. For AGRs assigned to HQ AFRC, HQ AFRC/DPM (for lieutenant colonel selects and below), andHQ AFRC/DPO (for colonel selects) will send the request for the officer to assume the higher grade toHQ USAF/REAMO for processing to HQ USAF/RE. For other headquarters assigned AGRs, USAF/REAMO will prepare the request and process it to HQ USAF/RE for approval. HQ AFRC/DPM will pre-pare the request for all other officer AGRs, and send it to AFRC/CV for approval.  The memo will includea recommendation for promotion, position control number, PAS code, and authorized grade for the posi-tion to which assigned. 6.7.  ANG and USAFR officers are eligible to compete for position vacancy and mandatory promotion onthe Reserve Active Status List (RASL), when the promotion board is convened IAW Title 10 USC14101(a), while the officers are mobilized under Title 10 USC 12302 commonly known as partial mobili-zation. 6.7.1.  For USAFR Colonel selects only while mobilized under Title 10 USC 12302: (for normal pinon rules see AFI 36-2115, Assignments within the Reserve Components para 1.5.5.4 applies) AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003356.7.1.1.  Officers may elect to voluntarily delay their promotions IAW Title 10 USC 14312 andChapter 8 of this AFI. They may elect to pin on their promotions on promotion effective date-with or without having a higher graded reserve billet. If the Colonel select does not have a highergraded reserve billet, the member may continue to look for a higher graded billet for up to 6months after promotion effective date or 45 days after the member is demobilized whichever islater. 6.7.1.2.  Colonel Selects who have a higher graded reserve billet may have their promotions accel-erated to a date no earlier than Senate Confirmation if they already are incumbent in a higher gradereserve billet during the time they are mobilized under this statute and they meet the accelerateguidelines of this AFI in Chapter 6 . Note that AGR colonel selects may be involuntarily delayed in pin on due to strength limitationsof the AGR force imposed by law. Paragraph 8.7. of this AFI applies to mobilized AGRs as well. 6.7.2.  For USAFR Colonel selects not mobilized upon actual pin-on date; If the officer has notlocated a vacant colonel authorization, the MPF should project the officer for assignment to ARPC(non selected reserve) with an EDCSA of 6 months from pin-on date. At 60 days prior to EDCSA (4months after pin-on date), if the officer has still not yet located a vacant colonel position, the MPFshould, through command channels, request a stop loss waiver to allow reassignment of the officer toARPC on the established 6 month EDCSA date. 6.7.3.  USAFR officers selected for PV promotion may pin on while mobilized under Title 10 USC12302 when the mobilized officer’s Senior Rater submits a signed letter to ARPC/DPBA stating theofficer is “in the reserve position”. The promotion effective date can be no earlier than 2 business daysafter receipt of the letter by ARPC; or the date the officer meets the Time In Grade requirements inTable 2.1. of this AFI whichever is later; or the officer is demobilized from Title 10 USC 12302. Thepromotion effective date in this case will be the day after demobilization or the date the officer meetsthe Time In Grade requirements in Table 2.1. of this AFI whichever is later. 36AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003Chapter 7  PROPRIETY OF PROMOTION7.1.  What is a Propriety of Promotion Action. A propriety of promotion action is a delay in anofficer’s date of promotion, a removal of an officer’s name from a promotion list, or information pre-sented to the SAF or a selection board that shows an officer may not be qualified for promotion. 7.2.  When to Initiate.  Commanders initiate a propriety of promotion action when there is cause tobelieve that the officer is not mentally, physically, morally or professionally qualified to perform theduties of the higher grade. Early identification of the officer and proper documentation is essential. For-mal rules of evidence do not apply to a promotion propriety action. Process promotion propriety actionson individuals selected for general officer grades according to AFI 36-2501, Chapter 12.7.3.  Who Initiates a Propriety of Promotion Action.  An officer's wing commander or equivalent ini-tiates a promotion propriety action. See sample notification letters at Attachment 11, Attachment 12, orAttachment 13. The MAJCOM commander reviews propriety actions as outlined in Table 7.1. ForIMAs, promotion propriety actions normally will be initiated by the command to which the officer isassigned. For IMAs in programs centrally managed at HQ ARPC (HC, JA, SG), promotion proprietyactions will be initiated by the command to which the officer is attached.7.4.  How to Initiate a Promotion Propriety Action.  The commander informs the officer of the recom-mendation, either verbally or in writing, before the effective date of promotion. See processing guidelinesin Table 7.1.7.4.1.  A propriety action must contain a clear statement of the reasons for the action and evidencedocumenting the reasons.7.4.2.  The officer must acknowledge receipt and understanding within a reasonable time (Table 7.1.,Note 3). Officers may submit statements in their own behalf, including supporting documents. Anofficer who chooses not to submit a statement must include a statement to that effect with receiptacknowledgment.7.4.3.  Whenever possible, initiate promotion propriety actions by giving written notice to the officer.If it is not possible to give timely written notice, the initiating commander gives verbal notice person-ally or, if necessary, through a designated officer. Follow verbal notice by written notice as soon aspossible. Once initiated, the recommendation to find an officer in the grade of second lieutenant notqualified for promotion (NQP) or remove an officer from a promotion list automatically delays thepromotion.7.4.4.  Build the case logically before presenting the case file to the appropriate office (Table 7.1.,Note 5). Put information in chronological order. Include required documents. The case file shouldcontain original documents. If necessary, reproduced copies are acceptable but must be legible. Usereadable, reproduced copies and retyped documents (certified as true copies). Include a detailed casesynopsis, suitable for review by the appropriate approval authority or the promotion board, which ref-erences pertinent and tabbed documents, statements, or other significant matters.AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003377.4.5.  Give the officer the opportunity to comment on all derogatory information added after theofficer first reviews and acknowledges the initial recommendation, unless the information originatedsolely from the officer's personnel record.7.5.  Involuntary Delay.  A commander has the option to delay the promotion of any officer the com-mander cause to believe that the officer is not mentally, physically, morally or professionally qualified toperform the duties of the grade to which selected. A delay also occurs if an action begins to remove anofficer from a promotion list. The MAJCOM/FOA commander is the approval authority for delaying apromotion up to 6 months from the DOR. After 6 months, the SAF must approve a delay action up to 12additional months.7.5.1.  Reasons for involuntary delay actions are:7.5.1.1.  An officer, exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over an officer on the Select List,receives sworn charges against the officer.7.5.1.2.  Court martial charges are preferred against an officer on the Select List.7.5.1.3.  An investigation is being conducted to determine whether to bring disciplinary action ofany kind against the officer.7.5.1.4.  The convening of a board to consider officers for selective early removal (Title 10 U.S.C.,Section 14903).7.5.1.5.  A criminal proceeding in a federal or state court is pending against the officer.7.5.1.6.  Strength in grade limitations imposed by law. See paragraph 8.7. for further information.7.5.2.  Delaying a Promotion. Commanders must not use promotion delays as punishment. Delay anofficer’s promotion at any time before the DOR, if any of the reasons in the paragraph above apply.7.5.2.1.  Extension of the delay period is automatic upon initiation of a recommendation to find theofficer Not Qualified for Promotion (NQP) to first lieutenant or to remove an officer from the list.Process a recommendation to extend a delay in the same manner as the original, except SAF mustapprove the extension of delay. The recommendation should arrive at HQ USAF/REPX (for staff-ing to SAF) no later than 45 days before expiration of the current delay.7.5.2.2.  If the reason for delay no longer exists, promote the officer to the next higher grade withthe same DOR as if the delay did not occur. Any commander in the officer’s rating chain maydetermine the reason for delay no longer exists. Table 7.1., step 12 specifies the appropriate pro-cess for notifying the member and disposing of the case file.7.5.2.3.  .If the SAF determines the officer unqualified for promotion during any of the delay time,the SAF may direct adjustment of the DOR and position on the RASL to reflect the unqualifiedtime. See paragraph 7.5.4.7.5.3.  Notifying the Officer. In order to delay a promotion under this paragraph, notify the officer inwriting (Attachment 11), of the grounds for the delay.7.5.3.1.  Give the written notice to the officer before the DOR. If not practical to give the officerwritten notice before DOR, give verbal notice and follow up with written notice as soon as practi-cal.38AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 20037.5.3.2.  If it is not possible for the commander or a representative of the commander to deliver thewritten notice to the officer in person, mail it to the officer by certified mail, return receiptrequested.7.5.3.3.  The officer may make a written statement to the approval authority in response to theaction. The approval authority will consider any statement made by the officer.7.5.4.  Maximum Length of Delay. Do not delay the promotion to the higher grade more than 6months after the date the officer would have been promoted, unless the SAF specifies a longer time.Do not delay a promotion more than 18 months after the date the officer would have been promoted,except as stated below.7.5.4.1.  1.90 days after final action taken in any criminal case against an officer in federal or statecourt7.5.4.2.  2.90 days after final action taken in any court-martial case against the officer.7.5.5.  Adjusting DOR. If the SAF determines the officer is unqualified for promotion during any partof a delay, the officer’s DOR, and position on the RASL are adjusted to reflect the unqualified time.The amount of unqualified time is added to the projected DOR. This action then adjusts the officer’sposition on the RASL.EXAMPLE 1. Based on selection by a promotion board, an officer’s projected DOR is 1 June 1998. The commander begins a delay action on 6 May 1998. The SAF finds the officer not qualified from 15 May through 17 July (2 months and 3 days). When the delay ends on 2 November 1998, adjust the officer’s DOR to 4 August 1998, to reflect the 2 months and 3 days of not qualified time.EXAMPLE 2. A second lieutenant’s projected DOR to first lieutenant is 30 October 1996. The officer becomes not qualified for promotion on 17 August 1996, and this lasts until 1 December 1996. The officer’s new DOR to first lieutenant is 15 February 1997, reflecting the 3 months 15 days of not qualified time.7.6.  Recommending a Second Lieutenant Not Qualified for Promotion (NQP). Table 7.1., ColumnD specifies the processing steps. When the preponderance of the evidence shows an officer not qualifiedto perform the duties of the higher grade, the commander recommends in writing that the SAF find him orher NQP.7.6.1.  The commander informs the officer of the NQP recommendation, either verbally or in writing,before the date of rank. The notification must state if it is necessary for special processing under AFI31-501, Personnel Security Program Management (concerning sensitive compartment information[SCI] access).7.6.2.  If involuntary separation or court-martial is pending, the NQP action must be flagged to permitSAF to hold in abeyance the NQP decision, pending resolution of the other action. This will avoidautomatic discharge of the officer. If the other action does not result in separation, the NQP action willbe processed to completion.7.6.3.  Commanders should give officers a reasonable opportunity to overcome the basis for theirnon-qualification before taking separation action. Retain a second lieutenant found NQP in currentassignment for 6 months, starting on the date the promotion would have occurred, unless retention isinconsistent with good order and discipline.AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003397.6.4.  If the commander determines the officer is NQP by the end of the 6 month period and does notwish to retain the officer further, separate the officer according to AFI 36-3209, Separation Proce-dures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members.7.6.5.  The commander can request SAF approval to retain the officer beyond 6 months for additionalobservation. Initiate request to arrive at HQ USAF/REPX (for staffing to SAF) no later than 45 daysbefore expiration of the initial 6 month period. SAF can retain the officer for up to 18 months from thedate the promotion would have occurred.7.6.6.  If during the retention period, the commander determines the officer is qualified for promotion,then promote the officer upon MAJCOM commander approval. The promotion is effective uponmeeting time-in-grade requirements or the date the MAJCOM commander determined the officerfully qualified for promotion, whichever is later.7.6.7.  If at the end of the retention period, the commander determines the officer remains NQP, thecommander must separate the officer. The separation must occur within 18 months of the date the pro-motion would have occurred. The commander informs the officer of the separation and advises theofficer of the rationale supporting the belief, in writing, and that he or she is subject to immediate sep-aration, as determined by the SAF.7.7.  Recommending an Officer Above the Grade of Second Lieutenant NQP.   If  a  commanderbelieves an officer is NQP, the commander should make that recommendation (Attachment 12). Table7.1., Columns D and E, specify the processing steps. HQ ARPC/DPJ presents cases of this kind to the pro-motion board for all officers meeting a promotion board.7.7.1.  The MAJCOM commander (Adjutant General for ANGUS officers) makes the final recom-mendation to the selection board to find the officer not qualified for promotion. The case file mustarrive at the selection board for consideration before the board finishes scoring the officer’s competi-tive category. Such a recommendation does not itself make the officer ineligible for consideration. 7.7.2.  HQ ARPC/DPJ gives the correspondence to the board to evaluate the officer's selection folder.The recommendation stays in effect until the board adjourns. 7.7.3.  The promotion board decides if the officer is qualified for promotion.7.8.  Removing an Officer from a Recommended List.  Table 7.1., Column F, specifies the processingsteps.7.8.1.  President. The President may remove the name of any officer from a promotion list at any timebefore the date on which the officer is promoted.7.8.2.  Withholding of Senate Confirmation. If the Senate does not give its advice and consent forappointment to the grade of colonel or above, the name of that officer is removed from the list.7.8.3.  To start the process, the commander informs the officer (verbally or in writing) of the pendingremoval from the recommended list. The commander must provide written notice if initial notificationwas verbal (Attachment 13). The officer must receive notice of the pending removal before the DOR.7.8.4.  A commander's recommendation to remove an officer automatically delays the promotion untilthe SAF makes a decision on that recommendation and either returns the package or forwards it to thePresident.40AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 20037.8.5.  A promotion selection board reconsiders an eligible officer if the officer was selected the firsttime but was subsequently removed from the list.7.8.6.  Continued Eligibility. An officer removed from the list by either the President or the Senatecontinues to be eligible for promotion. If considered, selected and promoted by a later board, theofficer’s DOR is normally established as if selected by the second board, unless the SAF grants theofficer the same DOR as if selected by the first board.7.8.7.  Promotion Removal time Standards. Removal actions will be processed as expeditiously aspossible. the total period of time that an officer's promotion is delayed pending decision on removal,including any prior period period of delay under paragraph 7.5., should not exceed 18 months, exclud-ing any period of delay attributable to the officer.

See paragraph 5.10.AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 200351Chapter 8  VOLUNTARY DELAY AND DECLINATION OF PROMOTION8.1.  Purpose. Due to circumstances beyond an officer’s control, the officer may be unable to accept pro-motion. An officer may apply for a voluntarily delay of promotion. For USAFR personnel, the approvalauthority for voluntary delays is HQ USAF/RE. This authority is hereby delegated to AFRC/CV (unit per-sonnel) and HQ USAF/RE (MA) (IMA personnel). The approval authority for ANGUS personnel isNGB/CF, who hereby delegates it to The Adjutants General. The authority may not be redelegated. Theofficer shall be considered to have accepted the promotion on the date the promotion is made unless theofficer expressly declines the promotion or is granted a delay of promotion.8.2.  Making Application for Delay. An officer must apply for voluntary delay of promotion before adelay may be approved. The application must be approved through the appropriate channels before theDOR. Officers apply by submitting AF Form 3988, Application for Voluntary Delay, Acceptance, orDeclination of Promotion (in three copies) to unit commanders. All applications must arrive at HQARPC/DPJ at least 30 days before DOR (or within 15 days of public release of the results, if DOR is onpublic release).8.2.1.  For USAFR unit assigned officers, the senior rater will forward, through appropriate commandchannels to HQ AFRC/DPMO, the original copy for processing to AFRC/CV for approval. HQAFRC/DPMO will send approved forms to HQ ARPC/DPJA, for filing in the master personnel recordgroup. The MPF will maintain a copy for the UPRG and provide the officer one copy.8.2.2.  For USAFR IMAs, the supervisor will forward the original copy through the Program Managerto HQ ARPC/CC. HQ ARPC/CC will endorse the application (if HQ ARPC/CC concurs) and forwardit to HQ USAF/RE for approval. Send approved forms to HQ ARPC/DPJA, for filing in the masterpersonnel record group. The MPF will maintain a copy for the UPRG and provide the officer onecopy.8.2.3.  For ANGUS officers, the unit commander will forward the original form through commandchannels to the state Adjutant General for approval. Send the approved form to ANG/DP to updatePDS and forwarding to HQ ARPC/DPJ. Maintain a copy for the UPRG and provide the officer onecopy.8.2.4.  For non-participating officers, submit two copies to HQ ARPC/DPJ for processing.8.3.  Consequences of an Approval of a Delay in Promotion. If approved, the officer’s name remainson the promotion list during the authorized period of delay (unless removed under another provision oflaw). At the end of the delay period, or at anytime during the delay, the officer may accept the promotion.If the officer wants to accept the promotion before the end of the delay period, an AF Form 3988 indicat-ing acceptance must arrive as stated below, within 5 days of acceptance of the promotion. The effectivedate is the date the officer accepts the voluntarily delayed promotion (Table 5.2., Rule 10).8.3.1.  ANGUS. Submit AF Form 3988 (in three copies) to unit commander. The unit commander willforward the form to the State Adjutant General who will forward it to ANG/DP, for publication ofpromotion orders (with copy to HQ ARPC/DPJA).52AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 20038.3.2.  USAFR. Submit AF Form 3988 (in three copies) through the unit commander to the seniorrater. When the senior rater endorses the form, the unit commander will forward it to HQ ARPC/DPJA (with copy to HQ AFRC/DPMO [unit assigned] or HQ ARPC/CC [IMAs]), for orders publica-tion.8.4.  Consequences of Disapproval of a Delay in Promotion.  If the application for delay is disap-proved, the officer must either accept the promotion or decline the promotion. The denial of a request fora delay of promotion is not considered a failure of selection for promotion unless the officer declines toaccept the promotion following the denial of the request for delay. See paragraph 8.9. for the effects ofdeclination of a promotion.8.5.  Length of Delay. An officer may request a voluntary delay, in 1 year increments, for up to 3 yearsfrom the officer’s original DOR. The appropriate approval authority may approve a period of delay lessthan the 1 year requested. If granted less than a 1 year delay, the applicant must reapply if a longer delayis needed. Each 1 year delay requires separate application and approval. Application must include imme-diate commander’s plan to utilize the officer in a future higher graded position(s).8.6.  End of Delay Period. At the end of the delay period, the officer must either accept or decline thepromotion. The promotion will automatically occur at the end of the approved delay period if the officertakes no action.8.7.  Delay for Limitations in Officer Strength In Grade (AGR). Promotion of an officer on theRASL, serving on active duty, to a grade with strength limitations set by Title 10 U.S.C., Section 10211and 12310, can be delayed to ensure compliance with those strength limitations. The delay expires whenthe strength-in-grade limitations no longer apply. The grade of the position determines whether a selectedofficer can accept the promotion at DOR. If the grade of the position does not support the higher grade,the DOR is delayed until the officer obtains a position to support the higher grade, or the officer completesthe tour. If the officer wants to decline the promotion, the commander submits the original AF Form 3988to HQ ARPC/DPJ (for inclusion in the Master Personnel Record) through HQ USAF/REPS and HQAFRC/DP.8.7.1.  When the promotion becomes effective, the DOR and position on the RASL of these officersremains the same, as if there had not been a delay.8.7.2.  An officer with a delayed promotion under this paragraph may request release from active duty.If granted, when the promotion becomes effective, the DOR and position on the RASL of these offic-ers remains same, as if there had not been a delay.8.8.  Declination.  An officer selected for promotion is considered to have accepted the promotion on theDOR unless the officer expressly declines the promotion. An officer must submit a declination statementno later than 2400 hours on the day before the DOR for mandatory promotions. For officers whose DORis the public release date, and all USAFR PV selectees, the officer must decline no later than 15 calendardays after public release.8.8.1.  USAFR officers (other than Active Guard Reserve [AGR]) sign the original and one copy ofAF Form 3988 and forward through their commander to the servicing MPF. The officer may declinethe promotion with a written statement clearly indicating the officer is declining the promotion. Thewritten statement must be signed, dated, and the officer’s SSN clearly written on the statement. TheAFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 200353MPF sends the original to HQ ARPC/DPJA. The MPF files a copy in the officer's unit personnelrecord group (UPRG).8.8.2.  ANGUS officers (other than AGRs) sign the original and one copy of AF Form 3988 and for-ward them through their commander to the servicing MPF. The servicing MPF sends a copy of thedeclination statement through state headquarters to ANG/DP and to HQ ARPC/DPJA.8.8.3.  AGRs sign and send an original and three copies of the appropriate declination statement(either an AF Form 3988 or a letter) through the commander to the MPF. The MPF files the declina-tion statement in the officer's UPRG. The MPF then sends the original to HQ USAF/REPS and HQARPC/DPMO (USAFR) or a copy to the state headquarters and a copy to ANG/DP (ANGUS). Acopy is sent to HQ ARPC/DPJA.8.9.  Effect of Declining a Promotion.  Declining a promotion causes the removal of an officer’s namefrom the promotion list and, if serving in a grade below colonel, the officer is considered a deferredofficer.54AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003Chapter 9  SPECIAL SELECTION BOARDS (SSB)9.1.  Holding SSBs. HQ ARPC/DPJ conducts promotion SSBs to consider officers who did not meet aboard or who were improperly considered by one or more promotion boards. SSBs replicate promotionboards, including pre- and post-board procedures and policies as outlined in Chapter 1, Chapter 3,Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this instruction, to the maximum extent possible. Exception: Panel membersmust be at least a colonel and the board president must be at least a brigadier general.9.2.  Granting SSB Consideration. Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) or afederal court can direct an officer for consideration by an SSB. The HQ ARPC Director of Personnel Pro-gram Management (HQ ARPC/DP) can approve an eligible officer for consideration by an SSB based onthe conditions below.9.2.1.  Grant SSBs, based on an administrative error, a legal or material error, or based on a formalappeal. SSBs consider officers for promotion to the grades of captain through colonel.9.2.2.  Administrative Error. An administrative error occurs when an eligible officer did not meet aboard. If this occurs, the officer can meet the next promotion board convened that will consider theofficer’s grade and competitive category.9.2.3.  Legal or Material Error. HQ ARPC/DPJ can direct an SSB for a nonselected officer, if the SAF,or a person acting on behalf of the SAF, determines:9.2.3.1.  The action of the board that considered the officer was contrary to law or involved mate-rial error of fact or material administrative error; or9.2.3.2.  The board did not consider material information that should have been available in com-pliance with pertinent Air Force directives and policies. Do not have an SSB if, by exercising rea-sonable diligence, the officer should have discovered the error or omission and could have takencorrective action before the originally scheduled board convened.9.2.4.  Pursuant to Formal Appeal. The AFBCMR may grant SSBs when it determines an officer'snonselection for promotion resulted from an error or injustice in the officer's record. Barring extenu-ating circumstances, the SSB will convene and the officer informed of the results within 180 days ofthe finding of an error by the AFBCMR.9.3.  Application for SSB. Officers submit applications for SSBs using DD Form 149, Application forCorrection of Military Record Under the Provisions of Title 10, US Code, Section 1552, or AF Form 948,Application for Correction/Removal of Evaluation Report.9.4.  SSB Procedures. SSB members consist of officers who meet qualifications outlined in paragraph1.9., and who are diverse representations of officers corresponding to the officers under consideration bythe SSB.9.4.1.  Reconstruct the records of officers under consideration, as they would have appeared to theoriginal board had the officers been properly considered. Compare the officers' records with bench-mark records from the original board.9.4.2.  Use the scoring procedures outlined in paragraphs 4.8. and 4.9.AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003559.4.3.  Select an officer if the SSB finds him or her fully qualified for promotion and the record: 9.4.3.1.  Scores higher than all the nonselect records and 9.4.3.2.  Ties at least one of the selected records from the original board.9.4.4.  Identify any officer considered by the board whose record indicates the officer should "showcause" for his or her retention on the RASL. The majority opinion of the members of the board willidentify these officers.9.4.5.  Provide a report according to paragraph 4.17.9.5.  Writing Letters to SSBs. An officer may write a letter to the SSB according to paragraph 4.7. Theletter must contain only information available to the original board. Mail the letter to the HQ ARPC/DPJA. Letters should arrive at least 30 days before the board convenes. Letters must arrive no later than0800 the day the board convenes for consideration by the board.9.5.1.  Individuals meeting more than one SSB prepare and mail a separate letter to each board.9.5.2.  Address letters to FY (insert the appropriate year and grade), HQ ARPC/DPJA. To preserveanonymity, do not date the letter and do not address letter to the Special Selection Board.9.6.  Results of SSB. 9.6.1.  Administrative Error. If the SSB conducted for administrative error does not recommend anofficer (or former officer) for promotion to a grade below colonel, the officer is a deferred officer.9.6.2.  Material or Legal Error. If the SSB conducted for material error does not recommend theofficer (or former officer) for promotion to a grade below colonel, the nonselection constitutes adeferral by the original board. The officer does not receive an additional deferral for the nonselectionby the SSB.9.7.  Promoting Officers Recommended by SSB. Promote officers upon Presidential approval and Sen-ate confirmation (if required). Promote the officer with the date of rank he or she would have received ifconsidered and selected by the original board. The member, based on his or her retroactive promotion bySSB, may be eligible for further consideration by selection boards, provided he or she meets the eligibilitycriteria.9.8.  Disclosing SSB Proceedings. Release of information is the same as mandatory promotion boards.9.9.  Special Review Boards (SRB). Special Review Boards consider officers who, at the time of theiroriginal consideration, had an error in their selection record that met a board. SRBs are used for promo-tion boards held before 1 October 1996. An SRB will convene at HQ ARPC in conjunction with a regu-larly scheduled promotion board. Only the Air Force Board for the Correction of Military Records(AFBCMR) can direct this board. The SRB will forward their recommendations to the AFBCMR for finaldeliberations. The AFBCMR will then notify the officer of the results of the SRB.56AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003Chapter 10  CONTINUATION BOARDS10.1.  Purpose. The purpose of continuation boards is to retain in an active status, officers who wouldotherwise be required to separate due to twice failing promotion to the next higher grade or reaching theirmaximum time in service (lieutenant colonel and colonel only). Individual application will not beaccepted for continuation until HQ USAF/RE determines a need for specific grades of skills exists withinthe entire USAFR. If a need exists, HQ USAF/RE will request SAF authorize conducting a continuationboard. When the SAF determines there is a need to retain additional officers in specific grades and com-petitive categories, officers meeting one of the above requirements may be invited to apply for continua-tion consideration.10.2.  Responsibilities. 10.2.1.  SAF Responsibilities. SAF determines when to hold a continuation board based on Air Forcerequirements.

If the officer declines continuation status, processes the officer according to proceduresestablished for twice deferred officers, or for officers required to separate for years of service, asappropriate.10.3.  Consideration for Continuation.  10.3.1.  Once SAF determines a service need exists, an officer, required to be removed from the RASLdue to twice failing of selection for promotion (current grade of captain and major), or for years of ser-vice (current grade of lieutenant colonel and colonel), may be considered for continuation status onthe RASL. HQ ARPC/DPJ will notify officers eligible to apply for consideration by a continuationboard.10.3.2.  Recommending Officers Not Qualified For Continuation. A commander will submit a notqualified recommendation as soon as the commander deems an officer is not qualified for continua-tion.10.3.2.1.  The commander will complete the recommendation before the selection board con-venes.10.3.2.2.  The commander must notify the officer of the recommendation and forward the packagethrough command channels. Any commander may disapprove the recommendation. The MAJ-COM commander signs it indicating approval and sends the package to HQ ARPC/DPJA for filein the officer's selection folder. If the MAJCOM commander disapproves the recommendation,the MAJCOM commander returns it to the servicing MPF. The MPF advises the initiating com-mander of the decision.10.4.  Effects of Continuation. Normally, a selection board will consider officers for continuation inconjunction with the promotion board that nonselects officers for promotion the second time. NOTE:Depending on Air Force requirements, stand alone continuation boards may be held to continue officerspast their mandatory separation date.10.4.1.  Effects of Selection for Continuation. If selected for continuation, the officer shall be retainedon the RASL. The officer remains eligible for APZ promotion consideration, while in a continued sta-tus, provided the officer remains otherwise eligible.58AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 200310.4.2.  Effects of Nonselection for Continuation. If not selected for continuation, the officer shall beremoved from the RASL for twice failure of promotion or for mandatory time in service requirements,as appropriate.10.4.3.  Notifying Officers of Selection or Nonselection for Continuation. Commanders have theresponsibility to notify officers of selection or nonselection for continuation. The commander shalladvise them to return acceptance statement or declination to the MPF10.5.  Initiating Removal from a Continuation List. If the commander believes continuation is notappropriate, he or she recommends the officer be removed from the continuation list. The commandernotifies the officer of the recommendation, verbally or in writing, before the officer accepts continuationor prior to the 60-day suspense. The commander will advise the officer not to accept continuation until theSAF makes a final decision. NOTE: Do not initiate removal from a continuation list once the officeraccepts continuation.10.5.1.  The commander forwards the recommendation to the servicing MPF who forwards therequest through command channels to HQ ARPC/DPJA. HQ ARPC/DPJA sends the package to SAFfor final decision.10.5.2.  The SAF approves or disapproves the action.10.5.3.  HQ ARPC/DPJA notifies the commander and HQ ARPC/DPAD (separations) of SAF deci-sion to remove the officer from the nomination list. HQ ARPC/DPAD separates the officer not laterthan the last day of the 6th month after President approves the nomination list.10.5.4.  If the SAF disapproves the removal from the continuation list, notify the officer of his or hercontinued status. The officer has 10 days from notification to accept or decline continuation on theRASL. If the officer does not respond, or does not accept continuation, HQ ARPC/DPAD separatesthe officer not later than the 15th day after notification date.10.6.  Completion of Continued Status. Continuation status may not exceed the last day of the month inwhich the officer completes the commissioned service shown in Table 10.1. An officer must accept ordecline continuation status if offered (see Attachment 14).10.6.1.  An officer’s continuation status will terminate when removed from the RASL, if selected forpromotion to a higher grade, or when terminated by the SAF due to a change in the “critical skillneeds” of the Air Force.10.6.2.  If the officer declines to accept continuation on the RASL, the officer will separate as if notconsidered or selected for continuation on the RASL.Table 10.1.

Processing Continuation Statements. Officers sign the acceptance or declination statement.Involuntarily separate or retire officers who fail to sign the statement within 60 days from public release,except when an officer has been advised not to sign the statement as required by paragraph 10.5.10.8.  Early Termination of Continuation. The SAF may reduce the period of continuation on theRASL due to subsequent changes in the "critical skill needs" of the Air Force.60AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003Chapter 11  SELECTIVE EARLY REMOVAL BOARDS11.1.  Purpose. If the SAF determines there are too many officers in any grade and competitive categorywith at least 30 years of commissioned service or 20 years of satisfactory federal service for retirement,the SAF may convene a board for the purpose of recommending officers, by name, for removal from theRASL.11.2.  Quotas. The SAF will establish a specific number of officers to be selected for early removal. Allofficers in the grade and competitive category being considered for early removal from the RASL are eli-gible for selection.11.3.  Conducting the Board. Conduct Selective Early Removal Boards in the same manner as SelectionBoards. See Chapter 1, Chapter 3, Chapter 4 and Chapter 5.11.4.  Notification of Selection or Nonselection for Selective Early Removal from the RASL.   SAFwill provide specific notification guidance for each selective early removal board conducted.AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 200361Chapter 12  PROMOTION TO GENERAL OFFICER GRADES 12.1.

A vacancy determination will be based upon the following criteria: (1) the position vacancy must be within the nominee’s Duty Air Force Specialty (DAFS - excluding prefix and suffix) in an organization managed by the nominating senior rater and (2) a position vacancy is defined within the nominee’s DAFS if the number of officers assigned in the next or higher grades (up to an including lieutenant colonel) is less than the number of officers authorized in the next or higher grades (up to and including lieutenant colonel). When determining vacancies within a DAFS, compute authorized and assigned figures separately for each Reserve category (i.e., Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs), Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs), Active Guard Reserve (AGR), tradi-tional unit participants, etc.). When computing the number of officers assigned by grade to a particular DAFS, do not count officers who, within 90 days after the board convening date, are either projected for reassignment from the senior rater’s organization or have an established date for removal from the Reserve Active Status List (RASL). If their date of assignment from the senior rater’s organization or removal from the RASL is projected to be later than 90 days after the board convening date, they must be counted in determining the number of officers assigned.An ExampleThis scenario assumes that all authorized/assigned are the same Reserve category (traditional unit reservists), are assigned to an organization managed by Col Smith (the senior rater), are assigned against DAFS 11A UMD positions, and are not projected for reassignment from the organization or removal from the RASL within 90 days of board convening date. The numbers shown are purely for illustrative pur-poses and were chosen to illustrate promoting lower grades against higher graded vacancies. Col Smith’s UMD authorizes the number of officers shown, by grade, in DAFS 11A, and he has the number of officers assigned as shown:GRADEAUTHORIZEDASSIGNEDCaptainMajorLt. ColonelTOTAL813163710141236PV Promotion from First Lieutenant to Captain. In this example, a captain position vacancy does not exist as the number of assigned captains is equal to or exceeds the number of authorized captains. If the number of assigned captains had been less than the number authorized, then eligible lieutenants could be nominated up to the point where, if these lieutenants were selected for promotion, the number of captains assigned equaled the number of captains authorized. However, 10 U.S.C. allows us to fill a AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 200373vacancy in any grade with an authorized appointment in any lower grade. With this in mind, we next look at the majors and find that the summation of captains and majors (21 authorized, 24 assigned) still does not yield a position vacancy opportunity. Had this example shown less assigned than authorized, then eli-gible lieutenants could be nominated up to the point where, if selected for promotion to captain, the num-ber of captains and majors assigned equaled the number of captains and majors authorized. However, when we bring lieutenant colonels into the mix, a position vacancy now exists as the summation of cap-tain, major, and lieutenant colonels yields the totals shown above (37 authorized, 36 assigned). Col Smith can thus use a lieutenant colonel vacancy to nominate one lieutenant for PV promotion to captain. If the lieutenant is selected, Col Smith will be unable to nominate any more lieutenants for PV promotion as long as the number of captains assigned is equal to or greater than the number of captains authorized, or the total captain/major/lieutenant colonel assigned mix is equal to or greater than the total captain/major/lieutenant colonel authorized mix.PV Promotion from Captain to Major. A major position vacancy does not exist as the number of majors assigned exceeds the number of majors authorized. If the number of assigned majors had been less than the number authorized, then eligible captains could be nominated up to the point where, if selected for promotion to major, the number of majors assigned equaled the number of majors authorized. However, when we bring lieutenant colonels into this mix, we now have 29 majors and lieutenant colo-nels authorized and 26 assigned. Thus, Col Smith can nominate up to three captains for PV promotion to major using existing lieutenant colonel vacancies. If all three captains are selected, Col Smith will be unable to nominate any more captains for PV promotion as long as the number of majors assigned is equal to or greater than the number of majors authorized, or the total major/lieutenant colonel assigned mix is equal to or greater than the total major/lieutenant colonel authorized mix.PV Promotion from Major to Lieutenant Colonel. As there are four less lieutenant colonels assigned than are authorized, Col Smith may nominate up to four majors for PV promotion to lieutenant colonel. Had the number of lieutenant colonels assigned been equal to or exceeded the number authorized, Col Smith would be unable to nominate any majors for PV promotion to lieutenant colonel. Additionally, if Col Smith nominates four majors and they are all selected, he will be unable to nominate any more majors for PV as long as the number of lieutenant colonels assigned is equal to or greater than the number authorized.Note that when determining if a valid vacancy exists, you first look at authorized/assigned in the grade you wish to promote to. You only bring the higher grades into the vacancy determination mix if the number assigned in the grade you wish to promote to is equal to or greater than the number authorized. Although this process is somewhat cumbersome, it allows us the potential to promote more officers via PV as well as the potential to continue promoting the more junior grades despite overgrades and overages. In the above scenario, we can promote up to 8 officers (one lieutenant, three captains, and four majors) using the four lieutenant colonel vacancies. Had we only looked at the grade we wished to promote to, we could only promote 4 officers via PV (no lieutenants or captains and 4 majors).Keep in mind that the above scenario is a snapshot used to compute a position vacancy at a given point in time. The DAFS authorized/assigned are dynamic variables that will constantly change due to accessions, separations, reassignments, promotions into (lieutenant to captain) or out of (lieutenant colo-nel to colonel) the DAFS mix, UMD changes, etc. 74AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003Attachment 5  SAMPLE ACCELERATED PROMOTIONMEMORANDUM FOR (Senior Rater)FROM:  CommanderSUBJECT:  Accelerated Promotion1.

Officers who are voluntarily returned to lead before the one-year has expired will have orders generated that are greater than three years, which automatically places them of the ADL. 90Table 5.2.

The US Senate confirms promotions to colonel and above.  2. DOR will never be earlier than the public release date.  3. AGRs will pin on the new rank only if USAFR strength limits are not exceeded and the promotion is approved by HQ USAF/RE . (AGRs may delay declination of promotion until date released from the tour.) 4. This date can be no earlier than the public release date (if the officer is in the position at that time), or the date the officer is placed in the higher graded position (when after public release date) and meets all the criteria. The letter must arrive at HQ ARPC/DPJA 2 business days before the proposed DOR. See also paragraph 6.5. 5. HQ USAF/REP makes USAFR colonel promotions incrementally. 6. Example: A first lieutenant with a DOR of 15 Mar 93, is not selected by the FY98 Captain Promotion Board. The officer meets the FY99 Captain Promotion Board and is selected. The officer’s DOR to cap-tain is 1 October 1998, the first of October of the Fiscal Year of the board. 7. Calculate the officer’s date as if selected (using the eligibility criteria based on the officer’s service dates) by a Reserve of the Air Force Selection Board. However, at no time will the date be sooner than the date of the officer’s transfer to the RASL. Also, see paragraph 6.5. 6.6. Promotion Procedures for USAFR AGRs. All AGR officers selected for promotion to the grade of colonel and below must obtain approval from AF/RE before the officer can assume the higher grade. For AGRs assigned to HQ AFRC, HQ AFRC/DPM (for lieutenant colonel selects and below), and HQ AFRC/DPO (for colonel selects) will send the request for the officer to assume the higher grade to HQ USAF/REAMO for processing to HQ USAF/RE. For other headquarters assigned AGRs, USAF/REAMO will prepare the request and process it to HQ USAF/RE for approval. The memo will include a recommenda-tion for promotion, position control number, PAS code, and authorized grade for the position to which assigned. 92AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 2003Attachment 17 IC 2003-1 TO AFI 36-2504, OFFICER PROMOTION, CONTINUATION AND SELECTIVE EARLY REMOVAL IN THE RESERVE OF THE AIR FORCE9 JANUARY 2003 SUMMARY OF REVISIONS This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2003-1. Except where noted, these changes apply to the ANG/and USAFR. These changes permit Air Reserve Component officers to compete for promotion under the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) while mobilized and explain administrative procedures to accomplish. This change adds Para 6.7. A bar (|) indicates revision from the previous edition. 6.7. ANG and USAFR officers are eligible to compete for position vacancy and mandatory promotion on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL), when the promotion board is convened IAW Title 10 USC 14101(a), while the officers are mobilized under Title 10 USC 12302 commonly known as partial mobili-zation. 6.7.1. For USAFR Colonel selects only while mobilized under Title 10 USC 12302: (for normal pin on rules see AFI 36-2115, Assignments within the Reserve Components para 1.5.5.4 applies) 6.7.1.1. Officers may elect to voluntarily delay their promotions IAW Title 10 USC 14312 and Chapter 8 of this AFI. They may elect to pin on their promotions on promotion effective date- with or without hav-ing a higher graded reserve billet. If the Colonel select does not have a higher graded reserve billet, the member may continue to look for a higher graded billet for up to 6 months after promotion effective date or 45 days after the member is demobilized whichever is later.  6.7.1.2. Colonel Selects who have a higher graded reserve billet may have their promotions accelerated to a date no earlier than Senate Confirmation if they already are incumbent in a higher grade reserve billet during the time they are mobilized under this statute and they meet the accelerate guidelines of this AFI in Chapter 6 . Note that AGR colonel selects may be involuntarily delayed in pin on due to strength limitations of the AGR force imposed by law. Paragraph 8.7. of this AFI applies to mobilized AGRs as well. 6.7.2. For USAFR Colonel selects not mobilized upon actual pin-on date; If the officer has not located a vacant colonel authorization, the MPF should project the officer for assignment to ARPC (non selected reserve) with an EDCSA of 6 months from pin-on date. At 60 days prior to EDCSA (4 months after pin-on date), if the officer has still not yet located a vacant colonel position, the MPF should, through AFI36-2504   9 JANUARY 200393command channels, request a stop loss waiver to allow reassignment of the officer to ARPC on the estab-lished 6 month EDCSA date. 6.7.3. USAFR officers selected for PV promotion may pin on while mobilized under Title 10 USC 12302 when the mobilized officer’s Senior Rater submits a signed letter to ARPC/DPBA stating the officer is “in the reserve position”. The promotion effective date can be no earlier than 2 business days after receipt of the letter by ARPC; or the date the officer meets the Time In Grade requirements in Table 2.1. of this AFI whichever is later; or the officer is demobilized from Title 10 USC 12302. The promotion effective date in this case will be the day after demobilization or the date the officer meets the Time In Grade require-ments in Table 2.2. of this AFI whichever is later.
