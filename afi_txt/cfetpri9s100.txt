This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, and training support resources.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.  Note: Due to the diversity of the career field no core tasks are identified.  Civilians and Senior Noncommissioned Officers occupying associated duty positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training within the career field.  2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the reporting identifier (RI).  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with RI qualifications (knowledge, education, training…); Section D indicates resource constraints: some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities; Section E, when used, identifies transition training guide requirements.  2.2.  Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Job Educational Training Standard (JETS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, and correspondence course requirements; Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support materials.  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses; Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this RI receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP provides information for the AFCFM, RI Manager, MFMs, commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training individuals in this RI should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the RI specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this RI.  Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are:   1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.  1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual's career.  1.3.  Lists training courses available for the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints impacting full implementation of the desired career path training process.  2.  Use of the CFETP.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the RI.  2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field, and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM and RI Manager to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and proficiency requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this RI must be identified for inclusion into this plan.  2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval of the CFETP.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  The RI Manager, MAJCOM representatives, and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AETC training manager for this RI will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  Using the list of 6 courses in Part II, AETC will eliminate duplicate training.   Section B – Information and Career Progression   4.  Report Identifier Description   4.1.

Additional  Off-Duty  Education.  Off-Duty education  is  a  personal  choice  that  is  encouraged  for all.  Individuals  desiring to become an Air Education and Training Command Instructor should be actively  pursuing an associate degree.  A degreed faculty is necessary to maintain accreditation through the  Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.  8.  Career Field Path  8.1.  9S100 Enlisted Career Path.  12    8.2.  Force Development.  Throughout their career, members of RI 9S100 are subject to a wide variety of taskings to support dynamic missions utilizing technologically advanced systems.  These systems and the science and technology behind each of them are, individually, complete fields of study in the academic world.  Expanding diversity of these mission tasks and the ever-changing technologies needed to meet them impact our most valuable resource - people.  Over the course of a career a 9S100 personnel may stay completely within one discipline, maintain one system, or work in multiple highly technical areas with a variety of related systems.  There are opportunities for advancement whether a 9S100 chooses to remain in one area of expertise or learns multiple systems.  It is essential we effectively and efficiently train our people to succeed in this challenging environment with modular (or just-in-time) training, advanced certificate and degree programs, and robust in-depth OJT.  Adequate training and timely progression combined with experience as airmen progress in their career play an important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its missions.  It is also essential everyone involved in training do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  Each 9S100 should continue technical development through a variety of means, such as technical manuals, advanced courses, off-duty education, seminars, etc.  Technical development, just like professional growth, never ends.  Enlisted personnel with a Bachelor’s Degree may be eligible to compete for a position in several Air Force master’s degree programs.  8.2.1.  AB – Amn  Airmen are primarily at a learning competency level, adapting to the requirements of the military profession, acquiring knowledge of military customs, courtesies, and Air Force standards, as well as striving to attain technical proficiency.  Formal technical training for entry level Airmen consists of the task and knowledge training provided by AETC and consists of several courses.  The first course, Scientific Applications Fundamentals, is currently taught at Goodfellow AFB TX.  This course provides the student with a basic understanding of general duty topics, electronic components, circuits, test equipment, computers, technical knowledge (math, science, and phenomenology), community mission and organization.  More importantly, it provides a technical foundation for analytical thinking, vital to all 9S100 jobs.  It is a prerequisite for entry into one of the four initial skills courses also taught at Goodfellow AFB TX.  These courses cover technical skills training and task-oriented training that prepares airmen for duties based upon the requirements of their specific assignment.  This training is intended to provide assignment-specific technical training immediately prior to using the required skills.  Selection for any specific initial skills course is contingent upon the requirements of the assignment.  Task and knowledge training requirements are identified in the JETS.  Individuals must complete the fundamentals course and one of the initial skills courses in order to be awarded RI 9S100.  8.2.2.  A1C  A1Cs fully comply with Air Force standards and are expected to devote their efforts to the mastery of technical skills and knowledge required in this RI while becoming effective team members.  The requirements for completion of training are: (1) qualification in and possession of RI 9S100; (2) complete qualification training requirements for current duty position; (3) satisfactorily perform in current duty position for a minimum of 12 months (a minimum of 9 months if a retrainee); and (4) recommendation of immediate supervisor.  Individuals moving to new duty assignments or positions may require advanced training to acquire the assignment-specific information and skills required for the new position.  The task and knowledge training requirements for these courses are identified in the JETS.  13 8.2.3.  SrA  SrA must begin developing supervisory and leadership skills through progressively challenging responsibilities on the job, professional military education, individual study, and mentoring by their supervisors.  The requirements for completion of training are: (1) qualification in and possession of RI 9S100; (2) complete qualification training requirements for current duty position; (3) satisfactorily perform in current duty position for a minimum of 12 months (a minimum of 9 months if a retrainee); and (4) recommendation of immediate supervisor.  Individuals moving to new duty assignments or positions may require advanced training to acquire the assignment-specific information and skills required for the new position.  The task and knowledge training requirements for these courses are identified in the JETS.  SrA will typically attend the Airman Leadership School (ALS) after serving 48 months in the Air Force or upon selection for promotion to SSgt.  8.2.4.  SSgt  SSgts are primarily highly skilled technicians with supervisory and training responsibilities.  They must also continuously strive to further their technical development.  SSgts must complete all duty position requirements.  Individuals moving to a new duty assignment or position may also require advanced training through additional 9S100 training modules, certificate programs, or advanced coursework to acquire the information and skills required for the new position.  Retraining members must complete Scientific Applications Fundamentals course and one of the four follow-on initial skills courses to fulfill the initial technical training requirements.  To become position qualified, retrainees will complete local duty position qualification training and must be assigned in the position for 9 months.  Commanders are expected to ensure that all 9S100 SSgts are enrolled in the ASA course as soon as possible.  This course, currently taught at Goodfellow AFB, TX, is a capstone to the technical training and is crucial to the SSgt understanding the important role that the 9S100 fills in the strategic posture of the DoD and the United States.  All SSgts are highly encouraged to complete the ASA course prior to sewing on TSgt.  9S100 SSgts should strive to complete the academic requirements for a CCAF Associate Degree in Scientific Analysis Technology.  Additionally, TSgt-selects and select SSgts, will be eligible to attend Phase 2 Comprehensive EPME (NCO Academy Intermediate Leadership Experience).  SSgt are utilized as leaders in training, standardization/evaluation, and shift supervisors.  SSgts are encouraged to explore developmental special duty opportunities such as AETC instructor, Military Training Instructor, Recruiter, etc.  8.2.5.  TSgt  TSgts are often their organizations’ technical experts in addition to providing sound supervision and training.  They are responsible for the development of all assigned enlisted personnel within their span of control.  TSgts must complete all duty position requirements.  Individuals moving to a new duty assignment or position may also require advanced training through additional 9S100 training modules, certificate programs, or advanced coursework to acquire the information and skills required for the new position.  Retraining members must complete Scientific Applications Fundamentals course and one of the four follow-on initial skills courses to fulfill the initial technical training requirements.  To become position qualified, retrainees will complete local duty position qualification training and must be assigned in the position for 9 months.  Completion of the ASA is highly encouraged prior to 9S100s sewing on TSgt to include TSgt retrainees as soon as feasible.  TSgts must continuously strive to broaden and perfect their technical expertise and supervisory techniques.  TSgts are eligible to attend Phase 2 Comprehensive EPME (NCOA ILE).  9S100 TSgts are also expected to complete the academic requirements for a CCAF Associate Degree in Scientific Analysis Technology and are highly encouraged to continue academic education through civilian institutions.  9S100 TSgts should explore developmental special duty opportunities such as AETC instructor, Military Training Instructor, Recruiter, etc. to better prepare them for SNCO 14 responsibilities.  8.2.6.  MSgt  MSgts are transitioning from being technical experts and first line supervisors to operational leaders who merge their personnel’s talents, skills, and resources with other teams’ functions to most effectively accomplish the mission.  MSgts must complete all duty position requirements.  Individuals moving to a new duty assignment or position may also require advanced training through additional 9S100 training modules, certificate programs, or advanced coursework to acquire the assignment-specific training required for the new position.  MSgts are continuing to develop their leadership and management skills, so individuals should take courses or obtain added knowledge on specific disciplines and techniques as well as management of resources and personnel.  SMSgt-selects and select MSgts, will be eligible to attend Phase 3 Comprehensive EPME (SNCO Academy Advanced Leadership Experience).  9S100 MSgts should have already completed the CCAF associate degree and are strongly encouraged to pursue off-duty educational opportunities such as completing an undergraduate or graduate degree program.  9S100 MSgts desiring promotion to SMSgt typically need to have served as a directorate/squadron superintendent, detachment chief/superintendent, functional manager (HQ USAF, Joint, National agency, or MAJCOM), or in another leadership position indicative of increased responsibility, in order to be competitive for the promotion.  8.2.7.  SMSgt  SMSgts are key, experienced, operational leaders who merge their personnel’s talents, skills, and resources with other teams’ functions to most effectively accomplish the mission.  SMSgts continue to develop their leadership and management skills in preparation for expanded responsibilities and higher leadership positions.  By this point in their career, they should be serving as a detachment chief/superintendent, directorate/squadron superintendent, functional manager (HQ USAF, Joint, National agency, or MAJCOM), etc., as well as be experienced in First Sergeant-related matters and staff functions commensurate with senior leadership roles.  This broad-base of experience is vital to effective 9S100 leadership and valued by unit commanders.  There are no career-field-specific knowledge/training requirements for SMSgt.  Individuals moving to a new duty assignment or position generally will not require advanced training to assume the new position, although certain duty positions may require qualification training.  Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education to include the Senior Enlisted ISR Master Skills Course.  SMSgts are eligible to attend Phase 3 Comprehensive EPME (SNCOA ALE).  9S100 SMSgts should have completed an undergraduate degree program (and considered a graduate program) to enhance technical, managerial, or leadership capabilities.  8.2.8.  CMSgt  CMSgts are expected to excel in all duty positions.  CMSgts must have a broad base of experience with and knowledge of most, if not all, 9S100 missions/duties.  By this point in their career, they should have served as a detachment superintendent/chief or MAJCOM or higher level position as well as be experienced in First Sergeant-related matters and staff functions commensurate with senior leadership roles.  There are no career-field-specific knowledge/training requirements for CMSgt.  Chiefs moving to a new duty assignment or position generally will not require advanced training to assume the new position, although certain duty positions may require qualification training.  Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.  9S100 Chiefs should have completed an undergraduate degree program (and considered a graduate program) to enhance technical, managerial, or leadership 15 capabilities.  CEM codes are not available to the RI 9S100 career field.  Section C – Reporting Identifier Training Requirements   9.  Purpose.  This CFETP encompasses the entire spectrum of training requirements for RI 9S100.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  This strategy is designed to be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication, eliminate a disjointed approach, and ensure universal availability of training for all.  9.1.  Modular training.  RI 9S100 uses modular training to effectively meet mission requirements and train airmen “just-in-time.” Non-prior service (NPS) students from Basic Military Training and retraining students attend initial skills training.  Initial skills training is task-oriented training that prepares airmen for specific duty assignment requirements using training modules developed for specific systems operated and maintained by RI 9S100 personnel.  Each of the four initial skills training courses will deliver training and assignment-specific requirements tailored to the first duty assignment.  Personnel currently holding RI 9S100 I and being assigned to new duty positions will attend advanced training modules that will provide just-in-time skills and knowledge tailored to the new position.  In most cases, this training will consist of one or more courses taught at Goodfellow AFB.  The aim of both the initial skills and advanced training is to deliver current, relevant knowledge and skills training for use at the next duty assignment.  Modular training does not replace or alleviate the need for OJT.  Every unit and supervisor must carefully consider what additional core knowledge and critical tasks are required and build a training and evaluation program to meet unit mission requirements.  The MAJCOM formal training section will schedule advanced training for RI 9S100 personnel reassigned to new duties on an as required basis.  9.2.  Classification and Tracking of Training.  As an RI, 9S100 personnel face unique difficulties in tracking and administering training.  9S100s do not have skill-levels and because of this the standard Training Status Codes (TSC) utilized by AFSCs do not match the RI upgrade training architecture.  Because of this, 9S100 personnel will be entered into TSC “Q” while completing qualification training (refer to paragraph 10.2.1.).  TSC “Q” indicates that an Airman is in qualification training for a specific position and will not restrict them from promotion testing.  Following the completion of qualification training 9S100s will be entered into TSC “R” (fully qualified).  Units will use a locally developed process to track 9S100 OJT.  In addition, if not already accomplished, a skill level waiver will be completed as soon as the individual arrives on station.  10.  Training Categories.  The RI 9S100 CFETP uses two categories of training: Initial training and Qualification training rather than skill levels.  10.1.  Initial Skills Training Requirements   10.1.1.  Knowledge.  Must possess fundamental knowledge of the following:   10.1.1.1.  Electronic Principles including: circuits, terms and calculations, circuit components, motors, logic functions, transmitters, receivers, antennas, computer theory, soldering, and the use of various test measurements and diagnostics equipment.  10.1.1.2.  Mathematics including: basic and exponential algebraic equations and standard deviation calculations.  16 10.1.1.3.  Sciences including: atomic structure and properties of matter, dynamics and force, conservation of energy, fluid and thermodynamics, electromagnetic radiation, characteristics of wave propagation through various mediums (earth, water, atmosphere, and space), radioactivity, and nuclear reactions.  10.1.1.4.  Phenomenology including: geophysical, electro-optic, material, nuclear radiation, radar, and radio frequency.  10.1.1.5.  Computer Technology including: computer communications and networks; workstation operation, troubleshooting methods, and procedures; theory, operation, installation, and maintenance of electronic data processing equipment and their operating systems.  10.1.1.6.  Logistics and Maintenance including: maintenance practices and logistics management procedures.  10.1.1.7.  Missions and organizations including: community structure, roles and responsibilities, general principles, national and theater assets, and operational applications.  10.1.2.  Education.  Completion of high school or high school equivalency is mandatory for entry into this RI.  Courses in physics, mathematics, and computer science are desirable.  10.1.3.  Training.  Completion of the Scientific Applications Specialist Fundamentals qualification course (X3AQR9S100 00AE) and one RI 9S100 awarding follow-on modular training course (Subsurface Analysis, X3AZR9S100 0A0B; Subsurface Systems Maintenance, X3AZR9S100 0A1B; Remote Systems System Analyst, X3AZR9S100 0A2B; or Special Equipment Maintenance, X3AZR9S100 0A3B) are mandatory for award of the RI.    10.1.4.  Experience.  None required   10.1.5.  ASVAB.  Required minimum aptitude scores: mechanical – 88, electronic – 85.  10.1.5.  Other.  Normal color vision, open to United States Nationals only, and individual must be eligible for a Top Secret security clearance in accordance with AFI 31-501.  A minimum score of 57 on the Electronic Data Processing Test (EDPT) and a minimum Strength Aptitude Code – K (70 lbs.) is required to enter the initial skills course.  Additional requirements are listed in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory.  10.1.6.  Training Sources and Resources.  The initial skills courses will provide the required knowledge and qualifications.  Initial skills training is accomplished through a fundamentals “prerequisite” course and a follow-on modular course at Goodfellow AFB TX.  The current JETS identify all tasks trained through these formal courses, initial skills requirements are identified in the Initial column.  10.1.7.  Implementation.  Upon completion of Basic Military Training, Airmen are assigned (PCS) to Goodfellow AFB to attend the fundamentals “prerequisite” course and a follow-on modular course.  Initial skills training for RI 9S100 personnel are satisfied upon successful completion of both courses.  Training status code “K” (Attending Technical School) is to be used for NPS and retrainees while in the required formal courses (Technical School).  17 10.2.  Qualification Training Requirements   10.2.1.  Qualification Training.  Qualification training begins at the first duty station when the individual enters OJT.  The requirements for completion of “qualification training” are: (1) completion of initial skills training and subsequent possession of RI 9S100; (2) complete qualification training requirements for current duty position; (3) satisfactorily perform in current duty position for a minimum of 12 months (a minimum of 9 months if a retrainee); and (4) recommendation of the immediate supervisor.  10.2.1.1.  Implementation.  Upon arrival at first duty assignment, unit training managers will verify NPS and retrainees are entered into TSC “Q” and a skill level waiver has been accomplished.  The OJT progress evaluation time frame requirement of 12 to 24 months as listed in AFI 36-2201 is waived and is replaced with the requirements in 10.2.1.  above.  Units will use a locally developed process to track OJT requirements.  10.2.1.2.  Completing OJT.  Units will use a Master Training Plan and associated Master Task Listing to establish the position qualification criteria for upgrade to qualified status.  Once the individual has met the qualification training requirements of 10.2.1.  above, the supervisor recommends the unit training manager to remove them from the OJT process.  10.3.  Modular Training Requirements   10.3.1.  Modular Training.  9S100s utilize modular training matched to their projected assignment.  Therefore, when a 9S100 is assigned to a mission area they are not qualified for, they will require an additional advanced course.  10.3.1.1.  Implementation.  Training status code “K” (Attending Technical School) is to be used while attending the advanced module at the technical school at Goodfellow AFB.  Upon graduation the TSC is changed to “Q”.  OJT begins upon arrival at the new duty station.  10.3.1.2.  Completing OJT.  Once the individual has met the gaining unit’s qualification training requirements the supervisor recommends the unit training manager to remove them from the OJT process.  11.  Training Status Codes.  The training status codes are derived from AFI 36-2201.  12.  Training Requirements by Rank  12.1.  AB – Amn  Training encompasses those items required to provide essential knowledge and skills used throughout the RI, such as electronics principles, AF indoctrination, basic mathematics, scientific principles, community mission and organization, and an introduction to computers and workstations.  It also provides assignment-specific training to introduce specialized skills and knowledge to be used at the trainee’s first duty assignment.  The goal of the initial skills course is to provide airmen with a broad-based technical education they can build upon and apply to all missions and systems combined with specialization tailored to their first duty assignment.  12.2.  A1C – SrA  Training begins at the first duty station after initial skills training and consists of qualification 18 training on all tasks required for the assigned duty position.  Additionally, knowledge on the specific technique/mission and experience should be provided as required through a variety of means such as OJT.   12.3.  SSgt – MSgt  Training consists of qualification training on all tasks required for the assigned duty position.  Personnel in these training tracks may require advanced training through modular training, certificate, and/or higher education programs in conjunction with a move to a new duty position or assignment.  Members that have not performed duties related to an advanced module that they had previously attended (more than four years ago) are highly encouraged to attend the appropriate modular course again, due to currency and proficiency.  13.  On-the-Job Training (OJT)   13.1.  General Responsibilities.  The duties and responsibilities of the AFCFM, 9S100 RI Manager, unit commanders, unit training managers, supervisors, trainers, and trainees are specified in AFI 36-2201, AFI 37-138, and this plan.  13.2 Documentation.  Training records will be accomplished using the current AFCFM authorized standard for 9S100 OJT documentation (Training Business Area is the authorized standard on the publication date of this CFETP).  If the standard for OJT documentation is not available, a waiver can be granted by the AFCFM.  In addition all training will be accomplished IAW AFI 36-2201.  14.  Special Experience Identifier Requirements   14.1.  SEIs.  SEIs identify special experience and training not otherwise identified within the personnel data system.  SEIs complement the assignment process but are not substitutes for AFSCs, prefixes, or suffixes.  They are established when identifying experience or training is critical to the job and assignment match, and no other identification is appropriate or available.  SEIs permit identification of a resource already experienced to meet unique circumstances, contingency requirements, or management needs.  They provide a means to track individuals and identify positions requiring or providing unique experience or training that otherwise would be lost.  Refer to the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, for a more detailed explanation and list of SEIs.  14.2.  SEI award and removal.  Each site should ensure SEIs are awarded as appropriate for proper personnel tracking.  Each unit loads their individuals via the appropriate personnel data system.  Requirements for the award of the SEI are:  14.2.1.  SEI 058, Advanced Atmospheric Research Equipment.  Award of the SEI requires position qualification in Advanced Atmospheric Research Equipment maintenance, 9 months experience, and supervisor recommendation.  14.2.2.  SEI 950, Subsurface Analysis.  Award of the SEI requires completion of Subsurface Analysis course, Subsurface Operations Monitor position qualification in Subsurface Analysis, 9 months of experience, and supervisor’s recommendation.  14.2.3.

This JETS will be used to identify technical training provided by AETC for the Scientific Applications Fundamentals course with class beginning 20 April 2017.  Training for the follow-on ABR courses will start with classes beginning on 28 August 2017.  2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, AIR FORCE TRAINING PROGRAM, this JETS:   2.1.  Lists in Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the RI.  2.2.  As a minimum, trainees must complete all critical tasks for upgrade to qualified status.  Critical tasks will be determined by the supervisor relative to the individual’s assigned duty position.  2.3.  Wartime tasks.  In response to a wartime scenario, RI 9S100 does not require accelerated training in accordance with AFI 36-2201, AIR FORCE TRAINING PROGRAM.  2.4.  This JETS provides certification for OJT.  Columns 3A, B, C, D, and E are used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use Training Business Area (TBA) to document technician qualifications IAW paragraph 13.2, if available.  Task certification must show a certification or completed date.  2.5.  This JETS shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Columns 4 A, and B show the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge.  2.6.  Qualitative requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the Proficiency Code Key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.  2.7.  The JETS becomes a JQS for on-the-job training when utilized with an Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:   2.7.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training in accordance with AFI 36-2201.  OJT documentation will use the current AFCFM authorized standard to document training (refer to paragraph 13.2.).  2.7.1.1.  Converting from old CFETP to new CFETP.  Use the new CFETP to identify and certify all past and current qualifications.  Document according to current Air Force instructions.  2.7.1.4.  Decertification and Recertification.  When an airman is found to be unqualified on a task, the supervisor shall remove previous certification and enter airman into qualification training.  Appropriate remarks are entered in the Individual Training Record as to the reason for decertification.  The individual is recertified using the normal certification process.  2.7.2.  Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and certified to the “go” level.  “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets the local requirements for accuracy, 21 timeliness, and correct use of procedures.  This equates to a “3c” in the proficiency code key.  AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures.  Local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and use of procedures shall be applied accordingly.  2.7.3.  Task Numbering.  All tasks have been numbered relative to the attachment number.

Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or subject knowledge which is measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check, and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check.  5.  Standard.  The standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objectives and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required 22 to repeat all or parts of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  6.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step by step procedures for doing the task.  7.  Course Objective List.  These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by Block of Instruction.  7.1.  Initial Skills Course.  A detailed listing of the initial skills course objectives may be obtained by written request to 312 TRS/DOE, Goodfellow AFB TX 76908-4213.  7.2.  7-Skill Level Course.  N/A.

The current listing of AFQTPs can be obtained at <http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/>.  Many of the products can be downloaded directly from the web.  These are not mandatory for this career field but may be of use for those individuals needing qualification in areas that are covered by an AFQTP.  8.2.  Computer Based Training Products   8.2.1.  Air Force computer based training products can be found at https://usafprod.skillport.com/skillportfe/main.action.   Section D - Training Course Index   9.  Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to aid commanders, supervisors, and trainers, by providing a list of training courses available to personnel within RI 9S100.  Many of the courses listed in this section are often required to satisfy command/organizational/positional unique training requirements that are not part of formal initial skills or upgrade training.  Supervisors should refer questions concerning specialized training, not available at the unit, to their respective unit/base training manager or to their command/joint activity functional manager.  Refer to the Education and Training Course Announcements located at <https://www.my.af.mil/etcacourses/> for a complete list of USAF Formal Schools.  NOTE: Although not all inclusive, the courses listed represent much of the formal training recognized by the functional community as applicable to RI 9S100.    23 10.
