As  a  result,  the  Air  Force’s recruiting program must attract, engage, and access the brightest, physically fit individuals to create a diverse, technically-savy, military force that can successfully execute the Air Force’s mission.  The demographics of this force should reflect the eligible, qualified population of the United States as much as possible. 1.2.  The Air Force Recruiting Program will aggressively and effectively market the benefits associated with  serving in  Active, Air National  Guard, and Air  Force Reserve components.  The recruiting program will be responsible for successfully branding the Air Force to ensure recognition and awareness by our primary audience – eligible applicants and influencers. 1.3.  Given  the  importance  of  the  recruiting  mission,  the  fact  that  most  recruiters  are  not collocated  with  military  installations,  and  are  the  sole  Air  Force  presence  in  many  areas  of the  United  States,  individuals  selected  for  this  duty  must  be  thoroughly  vetted  and  must exemplify the Air Force’s Core Values. 2.  Responsibilities. 2.1.  SAF/MR  serves  as  an  agent  of  the  SECAF  within  manpower,  military  and  civilian personnel  policy  and  program  domains.    SAF/MR  provides  guidance,  direction,  and oversight  for  all  matters  pertaining  to  the  formulation,  review,  and  execution  of  plans, policies, and programs addressing the recruiting programs for Air Force military personnel. 2.2.  AF/A1, in collaboration with AF/RE and NGB/CF, develops, coordinates, and executes personnel  policy  and  essential  procedural  guidance  for  the  management  of  Air  Force recruiting programs.
