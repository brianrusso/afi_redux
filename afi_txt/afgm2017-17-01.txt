 DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE           WASHINGTON DC  OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs  FROM:  SAF/CIO A6 1800 Air Force Pentagon Washington DC 20330-1800      AFGM2017-17-01 11 October 2017SUBJECT: Cyber Squadron Initiative (CS-I)          ACCESSIBILITY:  Publication is available for downloading on the e-Publishing web site at                             www.e-Publishing.af.mil.  RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication. Compliance with this Memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its  directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in  accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Air Force Guidance Memorandum immediately implements Cyber Squadron Initiatives. CS-I is a transformational program to align Air Force (AF) communications units to evolving joint and service Cyberspace Operations doctrine, and to support major commands (MAJCOM) in effectively organizing, training and equipping the Cyberspace Operations Workforce.  CS-I will refocus and strengthen traditional AF communications units in delivering enhanced mission assurance of wing-level assigned and attached weapons and mission systems to maintain operational advantage across the Air Forces’s five core missions.  The CS-I is now transitioning from the  Pathfinder program into an operationalization period for select AF units.  To begin the phased transition to CS-I, MAJCOMs, when requested by the SAF/CIO A6S, will provide a prioritized unit nomination list to receive approval to establish Mission Defense Teams (MDT) where relevant and feasible.  From FY18 through FY24, SAF/CIO A6S will select 15 CS-I transition units per year based on MAJCOM input, mission need, and CS-I Pathfinder unit lessons learned.  SAF/CIO A6S  selected units will receive equipment and training for each MDT to protect a single priority mission or weapon system.  MAJCOMs may opt to fund additional MDTs contingent upon sufficient training and equipment availability.  Not all AF communication units will have a mission requirement to establish an MDT, but may transition other aspects of the CS-I in later stages depending on their enduring mission support requirements and available  resources.  There is potential for a unit outside of a traditional communication unit to receive authorization to stand up an MDT, on a case-by-case basis, without follow-on steps to fully transition to CS-I based on MAJCOM nomination.   CS-I Pathfinder units from FY16 and FY17 will continue to inform the MDT foundational concepts in an advisory role to their respective MAJCOMs, SAF/CIO A6S, as well as provide mentorship for new transitioning teams for a timeframe envisioned from FY18 - FY20 with pairing based on mission to maximum extent possible.  CS-I Pathfinder and transitioning units are empowered to tailor processes to operationalize active defense capabilities to provide mission assurance and report those processes to their respective MAJCOMs and SAF/CIO A6S.  This Guidance Memorandum will serve as the bridge for the Pathfinder and transitioning units until the CS-I Program Action Directive is approved.  Please use this initial guidance to empower coordination with other functional communities to accomplish initial essential actions. Ensure that all records created due to processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air  Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). This directive applies to all military and civilian Air Force personnel, the Air Force Reserve (AFR), and Air National Guard (ANG).  This Memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date of this  Memorandum, or upon release of a new Air Force publication permanently establishing this guidance, whichever is earlier.
