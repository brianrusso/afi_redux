All most commonly missed questions were #5, 8,13,14 and 2l.  After further review of questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because they were poorly worded and difficult to understand.  Questions 5,8, and 13 focused on the SA-2,SA-6, and MiG-29 respectively.  The squadron intelligence section will increase emphasis on these threat systems during the next training cycle.  Attached is a breakout of the test questions and how many times each question was missed.    JANE E.DOE, Capt, USAF Chief, Intelligence Operations and Training  Attachment Test Question Breakout
