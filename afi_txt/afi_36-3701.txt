OPR:   HQ AFSPC/A1MH  Certified by: HQ USAF/A1D (Mr. Daniel R. Sitterly) Pages: 33   This  instruction  implements  Air  Force  Policy  Document  (AFPD)  36-26,  Total  Force Development,  and  establishes  the  Air  Force  (AF)  Space  Professional  Development  Program (SPDP)  for  career  management  and  professional  development  of  AF  space  professionals.    It outlines SPDP roles and responsibilities and describes the SPDP certification program, designed to  develop  a cadre of space professionals  to  effectively support AF space operations, planning, programming  and  acquisition.    SPDP  certification  is  founded  on  education,  training  and experience  milestones  that  ensure  purposeful  development  of  space  professionals.    Experience tracking  and  documentation  is  accomplished  through  the  use  of  Space  Professional  Experience Codes  (SPEC),  alpha-numeric  identifiers  that  characterize  space-unique  experience  and  the requirements associated with space billets.  SPDP certification is also the basis for award of the Space Badge.  This Air Force Instruction (AFI) does not supersede existing AFIs.  It applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units. The guidance in this AFI  complements  and  should  be  implemented  in  conjunction  with  existing  personnel,  career field  management,  and  military  education  and  training  AFIs.  Refer  recommended  changes  and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication;  route AF  IMT 847s  from the field  through the  appropriate  functional’s  chain  of  command.

Purpose.  The  SPDP  is  an  AF  Total  Force  program  to  provide  deliberate  career management  and  professional  development  of  space  professionals,  recognizing  that  a  broad, deep pool of fully qualified, knowledgeable space professionals is the primary means of assuring National Security Space (NSS) supremacy. 1.2.  Program  Authority.  Department  of  Defense  Directive  (DoDD)  5101.2,  DoD  Executive Agent for Space, identifies the overarching requirement to develop and maintain an inventory of space-qualified  personnel  for  planning,  programming,  acquisition  and  operations.  DoDD 3100.16, DoD Management of Space Professional Development, establishes policy and assigns responsibilities  for  managing  and  providing  oversight  of  a  cadre  of  DoD  space  professionals.  AFPD 36-37 establishes the requirement for a comprehensive SPDP to produce highly qualified space  experts.    As  directed  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SECAF),  the  Commander,  Air Force Space Command (AFSPC/CC) is the Space Professional Functional Authority (SPFA), in accordance  with  AFI  36-2640,  Executing  Total  Force  Development.    In  this  role,  the AFSPC/CC  is  responsible  for  the  SPDP  and  provides  space-specific  inputs  regarding  space professional development to Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)-specific Functional Authorities at HQ Air Force. 1.3.  Program  Objective.  SPDP expands knowledge, experience and systems understanding to ensure  AF  space  professionals  serve  effectively  as  integral  members  of  the  joint  warfighting community.    SPDP  is  structured  to  establish  knowledgeable,  experienced  space  professionals, skilled  in  fielding,  launching  and  employing  space  power.  This  requires  a  space  professional population that satisfies validated position requirements.  Accurate identification and tracking of individual  skills  and  position  requirements  is  critical.  A  fundamental  element  of  SPDP  is deliberate  linkage  of  education,  training  and  experience  credentials  to  personnel  utilization  to build and enhance institutional and occupational competencies for all space professionals. 1.4.  Background.  The  2001  report  by  The  Commission  to  Assess  United  States  National Security  Space  Management  and  Organization  (The  Space  Commission)  identified  several deficiencies:  space  leaders  had  little  or  no  space  experience,  space  personnel  lacked  focused career  development,  personnel  managers  needed  a  comprehensive  view  of  all  space  career positions, and career-long education programs were lacking.  The Space Commission urged the Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  to  cultivate  an  inventory  of  highly-skilled,  technologically advanced  space  experts  through  a  career-long  education  continuum  to  develop  highly-qualified space  leaders.    As  a  result,  the  SECDEF  issued  a  memorandum,  National  Security  Space Management  and  Organization,  18  Oct  2001,  directing  specific  actions  to  implement  the Commission’s  recommendations.    SPDP  is  the  AF  program  to  address  personnel  deficiencies cited by the Space Commission.  It covers the career spectrum, providing a rigorous certification program,  focused career  management,  and  assignment options to  ensure  effective utilization of space  professionals.    On  16  July  2003,  AFSPC/CC  signed  and  the  SECAF  subsequently approved  the  USAF  Space  Professional  Strategy,  the  roadmap  for  training,  educating,  and developing  space  professionals.  The  Space  Professional  Strategy  is  available  through  HQ AFSPC/A1MH.  This AFI implements the Space Professional Strategy.   6  AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010 1.5.  SPDP Structure.  SPDP is a career development process focused specifically on AF space professionals.    Its  principles  and  policies  cross  traditional  AFSC  structures,  addressing  the development  of  space  professionals  for  the  Total  Force.    SPDP  maintains  data  to  identify  and track  individual  qualifications  and  requirements  for  space  positions.    SPECs  identify  space experience  at  a  level  broad  enough  for  functional  application  but  specific  enough  for  effective resource management.  These data also enable assessment of the health of the space professional inventory through a variety of metrics and career field analysis tools.  SPECs and structure will be  migrated  to  an  Air  Force  enterprise  Information  Technology  (IT)  solution  for  capability management once approved by AF/A1. 1.6.  Space  Professional  Disciplines.  The  core  disciplines  include  operations,  scientists, engineers,  program  managers,  weather,  communications  and  intelligence;  officer  AFSCs:  selected 13S, 14N, 15W, 33S, 61X, 62E, 63A; enlisted AFSCs: 1C6, and selected 1N0/1/2/4/5, 1W0 and 3D1.  Expansion to  include additional disciplines is  at  the discretion of the SPFA, in conjunction with the applicable Functional Authority, and is based on the degree of space-related activities performed within the discipline, as defined in billet requirements (see paragraph 4.8). 1.6.1.  Operations  (Space  [13S  and  1C6]).  Space  operations  is  a  diverse  discipline requiring  knowledgeable  and  technically-sound  operators  who  have  the  ability  to  employ their systems effectively.  Space operations requires a thorough understanding of the impact of space effects on joint air, land, sea and cyberspace operations. 1.6.2.  System  Acquisition  (Scientists  [61X],  Engineers  [62E]  and  Program  Managers [63A]).    Acquisition  personnel  with  the  appropriate  breadth  and  depth  of  space  experience are vital to SPDP and are responsible for delivering the capabilities-based space systems to meet  mission  objectives.    Additionally,  acquisition  personnel  provide  engineering  and technical support to operations. 1.6.3.  Intelligence  and  Communications.  Selected  14N  and  33S  officers  and  enlisted 1N0/1/2/4/5 are space professionals, based on duties with direct space mission roles.   Also included  are  enlisted  personnel  in  AFSC  3D1  who  have  served  or  are  serving  in  space positions.    In  addition  to  SPDP  tracking,  intelligence  personnel  will  be  assigned  a  Space Special  Experience  Identifier  which  will  also  be  used  to  track  personnel  but  will  not  affect career management. 1.6.4.  Weather.  Selected 15W officers and 1W0 enlisted are space professionals, based on duties  relating  to  space  environment;  intelligence,  surveillance  and  reconnaissance;  and launch weather that directly impact space missions. 1.7.  SPDP  and  Total  Force  Development.  SPDP complements AF Total Force Development as  defined  in  AF  Doctrine  Document  1-1,  Leadership  and  Force  Development,  and  AFI  36-2640.  The SPDP recognizes the need to develop appropriate depth in functional areas while also meeting  institutional  and  professional  needs.    The  SPDP  requires  varying  levels  of  space professional  specialization  and  is  deliberately  managed  to  ensure  the  appropriate  inventory  is available to meet functional technical specifications balanced against institutional requirements.  As outlined in AFI 36-2640, the SPFA interacts with the other Functional Authorities to ensure space  requirements  are  factored  into  overall  Air  Force  requirements  for  each  AFSC.    This includes  long-  and  short-term  manpower  forecasts;  personnel  requirements;  and  education, training and experience criteria for space cadre development.  The Space Professional Functional Authority  Advisory  Council  (SPFAAC)  supports  the  SPFA  and  includes  representatives  from AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010   7  key  organizations  associated  with  the  SPDP.    The  Space  Professional  Management  Office (SPMO),  HQ  AFSPC/A1MH,  has  primary  responsibility  for  SPDP  policy  development  and execution  in  accordance  with  SPFA  guidance  and  this  instruction.    SPFA  inputs  enable applicable Development Teams (DT) to effectively manage space professionals based on specific education,  training,  experience  and  certification  requirements  to  meet  AF  requirements.    DTs play a critical role in developing officers and civilians to support current and projected mission capabilities.  They ensure senior leadership within each career field is familiar  with the people in their  functional  area,  assess  potential  for  future  opportunities;  prepare  senior  leaders  with  a comprehensive  understanding  of  both  functional  and  institutional  personnel  requirements  and balance  those  requirements  for  personnel  utilization.    DT  membership  includes  key  Force Development  stakeholders  selected  by  the  career  field  Functional  Manager  to  represent  all aspects of the AFSC’s mission responsibilities. 1.7.1.  Depth and Breadth.  Space professionals will have depth and breadth of experience.  Depth  and  breadth  are  achieved  differently  among  the  various  AFSCs  with  space professionals.    For  operators  (AFSC  13S  and  1C6),  depth  is  achieved  through  a  core  of experience  in  specific  space  career  paths.    Breadth  is  achieved  through  experience  in  other mission  areas,  crossflow  between  operations-acquisition  duties  and  across  mission responsibilities  in  the  NSS  community.    Depth  for  other  space  professionals  generally equates to  two or three space-related tours and breadth  refers to  experience with  more than one space mission or expanded experience within the particular specialty.  Depth and breadth of experience will increase mission effectiveness and reinforce space education. 1.7.2.  Tailored, Deliberate Development.  SPDP recognizes the continuing need for depth in  functional  areas while presenting opportunities to  achieve the wider perspective required for  future  AF  leaders.    This  means  space  professionals’  development  will  be  more  tailored and  deliberate  within  identified  space  mission  areas.    Specialists  requiring  depth  of experience  will  need  more  relevant  and  focused  education  and  training.    After  acquiring sufficient depth, future senior leaders will have more opportunities to gain greater breadth of experience.    The  emphasis  is  to  provide  career-long  education,  training  and  experience opportunities, combined with a deliberate assignment approach, to match individual aptitude and expectations with mission needs. 1.8.  SPDP and the Assignments Process.  Effective linkage between SPDP and assignments is critical  to  successful  space  professional  career  development.    Important  aspects  of  this relationship are outlined below. 1.8.1.  Assignment  Teams  (AT).  The  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC)  ATs  execute permanent  change  of  station/assignment  actions  for  space  professionals  to  meet  SPDP objectives, space billet requirements and Trained Personnel Requirements consistent with AF priorities.  Since the primary factor in assignment selection is individual qualifications (AFI 36-2110, Assignments, paragraph 2.4.), the AFPC 1C6 AT and HQ AFSPC/A1MH (the 1C6 Functional Manager) will coordinate on AFPC’s identification of the most qualified member for  assignment  to  positions  requiring  specific  experience.    Those  assignments  requiring specialized skills may be advertised through Equal Plus. 1.8.2.  The  Space  Assignment  Advisory  Board  (SAAB).    This  board  is  co-chaired  by AFSPC/CV  and  the  Deputy  Director  of  the  National  Reconnaissance  Office  (NRO)  and  is made  up  of  AFSPC  and  NRO  operations,  acquisition,  communications  and  intelligence   8  AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010 representatives.  Its focus is management of AF personnel within the NRO.  It monitors the balance  of  AF  and  NRO  space  professional  manning  and  experience  levels  to  ensure appropriate development and utilization of space professionals.  An additional SAAB goal is development  of  a  sufficient  pool  of  senior  space  leaders  with  operations  and  acquisition experience in both organizations. The SAAB will provide inputs for review by the SPFAAC and is responsible to the SPFA. 1.8.3.  Utilization  of  Space  Professionals.  A  key  element  of  SPDP  is  tracking  of  space professionals’  experience  to  ensure  an  adequate  inventory  of  expertise  is  available  to  meet space  mission  needs,  while  at  the  same  time  considering  broader  AF  needs.    The  SPMO supports  the  SPFA  in  this  effort  by  providing  data  to  identify  qualified  space  professionals with  the  skills  to  satisfy  position  requirements.    However,  career  management  of  space-qualified individuals in AFSCs 14N, 15W, 33S, 61X, 62E, 63A, 1N0/1/2/4/5 and 3D1 often includes  non-space  assignments.    By  tracking  their  space  expertise,  the  SPMO  catalogs available skills  that may be used for space requirements, based on cooperation between the applicable Functional Authorities, DTs and ATs. 1.9.  SPDP and Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP).  SPDP and APDP, as  prescribed  by  Department  of  Defense  Directive  (DoDD)  5000.52,  Defense  Acquisition, Technology,  and  Logistics  Workforce  Education,  Training,  and  Career  Development Program, are compatible.  Developing and nurturing space acquisition expertise is a SPDP tenet, since space systems  acquisition requires a unique set  of acquisition skills.  Space professionals with acquisition expertise need APDP to develop general acquisition skills and SPDP for space-focused  acquisition  capabilities.    Additionally,  the  breadth  of  acquisition  expertise  provided through  space  and  non-space  acquisition/engineering  experience  is  valuable  from  an  Air  Force perspective. AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010   9  Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES/AUTHORITIES 2.1.

The purpose of SPDP is to develop, through individual career management and rigorous certification criteria, AF space professionals fully qualified to field, launch and employ space capabilities to achieve national security objectives.  Space professionals must be capable of managing  complex  development  and  acquisition  programs,  creating  new  space  doctrine  and concepts of operation, operating a wide range of space platforms and missions, integrating space capabilities  into  joint  warfighting  and  projecting  space  power  as  needed  by  national  decision makers  and  joint  warfighters.    This  requires  critical  thinking  and  problem-solving  skills  to deliver combat capability using increasingly complicated and dynamic space systems.  The main elements of SPDP include: 3.1.1.  A  continuum  of  relevant  education  spread  throughout  each  space  professional’s career. 3.1.2.  Appropriate training for space professional duty positions. 3.1.3.  Experience coding based on SPECs. Note:  Experience code structure for SPEC will be  transitioned  to  an  Air  Force  enterprise  IT  solution  for  capability  management  once approved by AF/A1. 3.1.4.  A  database  that  contains  SPECs  and  tracks  individual  space-relevant  experience, education, and training; space billet requirements; and provides data for metrics on the state of the space professional inventory and SPDP effectiveness. 3.1.5.  A  certification  program  that  merges  education,  training  and  experience  to  establish three distinct levels of space expertise. 3.2.  Space  Education.  Mission  effectiveness  demands  technologically  sound  personnel; sustained  by  career-long  education  in  applicable  science,  engineering,  application,  theory  and doctrine.  SPDP provides an educational framework designed to provide space-related education throughout  the  space  professional’s  career.    Space  education  consists  of  UST,  Space  200  and 300,  continuing  education  and  academic  programs.  The  principal  agencies  for  space  education are AETC, NPS, the NSSI and civilian institutions. AETC’s AFIT, Air University and the 381st Training Group (TRG) each contribute to space education.  Space professionals are expected to attain  appropriate  education,  commensurate  with  their  rank,  responsibilities  and  career progression  as  mandated  by  SPDP  certification  standards  and  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Air  Force guidance.  Officer space professionals are strongly encouraged to complete a master’s degree in a  space-related  area.    Enlisted  space  professionals  must  complete  a  Community  College  of  the Air Force (CCAF) degree to attain Level 3 certification.  Table 3.1. illustrates eligibility criteria and selection procedures for UST, Space 200 and Space 300.   14   AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010 Table 3.1.  Space Professional Course Eligibility/Selection.

Weather and Communications personnel attend either ASOpS Space Fundamentals Course or UST. Selection is managed at unit level in coordination with the SPMO. AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010   15  3.2.1.  381  TRG.  The 381 TRG teaches  UST, the  initial  phase of space  education for 13S, 1C6 and selected 15W, 33S, 61X, 62E, 63A space professionals. 3.2.1.1.  UST  is  an  introduction  to  AF  space  systems,  space  acquisition  and  the  tactical level  of  warfighting.  The  course  provides  an  initial  background  in  orbital  mechanics, trajectories, space environment, communications, sensor fundamentals, organizations and space history. 3.2.1.2.  Company  grade  13S  and  1C6  space  professionals  will  attend  UST,  usually  en route  to  their  initial  space  assignment  (exceptions  are  determined  by  the  SPMO  in conjunction  with  the  gaining  unit).    All  61X,  62E  and  63A  officers  designated  to  fill space billets will also attend UST, either en route the space assignment or during the first two  years  of  space  duty.    New  field  grade  space  professionals  scheduled  for  IQT  will attend UST; those en route to staff positions will attend the ASOpS Space Fundamentals Course, but may attend UST on a space available basis with SPMO approval.  Exceptions requiring quotas to be moved must be coordinated with the 2AF/TTOC-P, Quota Control Point. 3.2.1.3.  Upon  assignment  to  space-related  duty,  14N  officers  complete  the  Space Intelligence Formal Training Unit course in lieu of UST.  Initial space education for 15W and  33S  officers  is  accomplished  by  completion  of  the  ASOpS  Space  Fundamentals Course  or  UST,  depending  on  the  requirements  for  their  unit  of  assignment,  with Functional Manager and SPMO concurrence. 3.2.2.  NSSI.  The NSSI, part of AU’s Eaker Center of Professional Development, is the DoD center of excellence for space education for the NSS community.  It researches, develops and instructs  courses technologies,  capabilities,  operational  concepts, acquisitions and tactics in support of joint service strategies to develop certified DoD space professionals. in  space  system 3.2.2.1.  Space Professional courses include Space 200 and 300, which are required for space professionals at key career milestones. 3.2.2.1.1.  Space  200  is  for  mid-career  space  professionals.    It  focuses  on  the operational  level  of  warfighting  and  space  applications  by  refreshing  and  providing more depth on the concepts offered in UST.  It also includes space-related policy and doctrine,  space  system  design,  development,  and  acquisition  and  explores  space integration and tactics in joint warfare. 3.2.2.1.2.  Space  300  is  the  senior  level  space  professional  course,  focused  on  the strategic level of warfighting and acquisition of space capabilities.  It prepares space professionals  for  senior  leadership  roles  and  includes  integration  of  space  effects  to the warfighter, space acquisition, and space-related strategy, policy, doctrine and law. 3.2.3.  AFIT and NPS.  These schools offer graduate space certificate and degree programs for  qualified  space  professionals  of  all  services.    See  the  Space  Professional  Development website  for  an  overview  of  these  programs  and  links  to  associated  websites  for  additional information and enrollment instructions: http://www.afit.edu and http://www.nps.edu. 3.2.4.  Civilian  Institutions.  Several  civilian  institutions  provide  space-related  programs that  are  beneficial  to  space  professional  development  and  mission  effectiveness.    For   16  AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010 example,  the  AFSPC-University  of  Colorado  at  Colorado  Springs  Space  Education Memorandum of Understanding (July 2007) addresses the need for broader space education opportunities.    As  a  result,  the  University  of  Colorado  at  Colorado  Springs  established  the Space Certificate program as a starting point for space-related advanced degrees. 3.2.5.  CCAF.  CCAF  is  one  of  several  federally  chartered  degree-granting  institutions;  the only  2-year  institution  exclusively  serving  enlisted  personnel.  CCAF  awards  associate  in applied  science  degrees  once  enlisted  personnel  complete  programs  designed  for  specific AFSCs.    Enlisted  space  professionals  are  required  to  complete  a  CCAF  degree  for  their AFSC  to  attain  Level  3  SPDP  certification.    Application  is  accomplished  through  the  AF Virtual Education Center or local base education offices.  3.2.6.  Other Education Programs. 3.2.6.1.  Continuing  Education.  Space  professionals  should  stay  current  and  actively pursue  a  self-improvement  program.  Space-related  professional  reading,  self  study, community outreach and ongoing interest in developments in space capabilities, missions and systems will ensure a knowledgeable, informed community of professionals. 3.2.6.2.  The Spacelift Education and Crossover Program (SLEC-P) provides on-the-job education, experience, and exposure to the civilian industrial environment as well as experience  in  management  techniques  used  by  major  defense  and  commercial  launch contractors.   SLEC-P  is  a  two-phased  program  designed  for  61X,  62E,  63A  and  13S officers.  After completion of a Phase I Education with Industry (EWI) assignment, 61X, 62E  and  63A  officers  are  placed  in  spacelift  13S  jobs  and  13S  officers  are  placed  in spacelift  acquisition  jobs  for  a  3-year  assignment.    Officers  retain  their  original  core AFSC  throughout.    AFPC/DPAO  and  DPAS  conduct  an  annual  SLEC-P  board  and publish selection results prior to the summer assignment cycle. 3.3.  Space  Training  consists  primarily  of  IQT,  Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT),  and specialized  training.    Training  policy  and  management  are  the  responsibility  of  AF/A1  and  the training  course  owner;  occupational  competencies  are  determined  by  the  respective  functional communities.    The  principal  agencies  for  space  training  are  the  381st  TRG,  the  ASOpS,  the USAF Weapons School and AFSPC operational units. 3.3.1.  IQT for operations personnel is conducted by the 381 TRG.  Some mission areas do not have formal IQT programs.  In this case, initial training is provided by the unit. 3.3.2.  MQT  is  typically  employed  to  establish  and  maintain  operations  Combat  Mission Ready (CMR) status, and is provided by the applicable operational units. 3.3.3.  Initial specialty training for 14N, 15W, 33S, 61X, 62E, 63A, 1N0/1/2/4/5 and 3D1 is accomplished in accordance with the career field education and training plan or the training standard for each AFSC. 3.3.4.  Specialized  training to  prepare  space professionals  for  specific  duty  in  a  particular  mission  area.    For  example,  ASOpS  courses provide space training to prepare warfighters for deployed duty in joint military operations. Selected officer space operators attend focused training at the USAF Weapons School. involves  focused  programs  designed AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010   17  3.3.5.  Advanced  Courses are taught  by the ASOpS  and are  focused programs  designed to create  depth  of  expertise  in  specific  mission  areas.  These  courses  prepare  students  to  be subject  matter  experts  who  return  to  their  units  to  provide  improved  training,  tactics development, and acquisition management. 3.4.  Space  Experience  is  an  essential  element  of  SPDP.  Space  professionals  must  attain specific  experience  milestones  to  qualify  for  SPDP  certification.  The  primary  means  of measuring space professionals’ experience is through SPECs, a tracking methodology focused on space-unique  experience  across  the  Air  Force.    SPECs  are  a  key  element  of  SPDP  inventory management and requirement identification.  Note:  Experience code structure for SPECs will be transitioned to an Air Force enterprise IT solution for capability management once approved by AF/A1. 3.4.1.  SPECs  identify a specific space skill  set  and allow detailed documentation  of space professionals’  experience  using  three  characters.    See  Attachment  2  for  additional information and SPEC examples. 3.4.2.  SPECs  quantify space professionals’  experience in  specific missions, as well as the currency,  depth  and  breadth  of  that  experience.    SPECs  are  also  used  to  describe requirements  for  space  billets.    The  dual  application  of  SPECs  facilitates  identification  of appropriate  candidates  for  space  positions,  enables  accurate  measurement  of  the  space professional  inventory,  identifies  space  requirements  across  the  NSS  community,  and highlights experiential requirements for key leadership positions.  SPEC data are also used to develop SPDP metrics. 3.5.  Space Professional Database. 3.5.1.  Space  Professional  Database  Capability.  Accurate  identification,  documentation and  tracking  of  space  professional  skills  and  position  requirements  enable  effective  SPDP execution.    The  SPMO  maintains  a  database  capability  that  accomplishes  this  function  to ensure  a  common  approach  that  documents  space  professional  education,  training  and experience and space billet requirements.  The database uses SPECs to categorize experience and  allows  an  assessment  of  the  overall  inventory  of  space  professionals  to  meet  billet requirements.  It is a valuable tool for matching individual space professional qualifications with billet requirements.  Note: Structure, content and functionality of the Space Professional Database  will  be  transitioned  to  an  Air  Force  enterprise  IT  solution  for  capability management once approved by AF/A1. 3.5.2.  Data Sources.  The data come from two sources:  AFPC and the SPMO.  The AFPC data residing in the master personnel data systems are the primary source and provide service dates, AFSCs, duty history,  education and training. The SPMO provides  SPDP-related data such  as  SPECs,  Space  Badge  award  level,  SPDP  certification  level  and  space  professional continuing education course completion. 3.5.3.  Database Users.  Two other organizations use the database in addition to the SPMO.  AFPC uses the data to support DTs and ATs. SMC maintains a subset of the officer database that includes only personnel assigned to SMC.   18  AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010 3.5.4.  Career Opportunities Guide (COG).  The COG has two sections: a career guidance document  and  a  space  billet  database.    The  COG  provides  information  to  help  space professionals  make  informed  choices  as  they  pursue  a  space  career  and  assists  space professional  leaders  in  their  role  as  mentors.  The  COG  includes  guidance  for  officers, enlisted, and civilians and contains notional career paths for operators and acquirers.  It also includes  a  listing  of  all  AF  space  positions  by  organization,  with  position  descriptions  and organizational  information.    Reference  the  COG  at  https://halfway.peterson.af.mil/COG for additional information. AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010   19  Chapter 4 SPACE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM CERTIFICATION. 4.1.  Purpose.  SPDP certification is based on specific education, training and experience criteria used  to  document  individual  qualifications,  identify  space  billet  requirements  and  facilitate  an effective  match  of  individuals  to  jobs  for  mission  success.    Certification  is  the  basis  for  space professional  career  management  through  consistent  and  attainable  standards  at  several  career points.    These  standards  comply  with  AF  Force  Development  and  facilitate  guidance  for assignment processes.  In many cases, individuals categorized as space professionals (e.g., 14N, 15W, 33S, 61X, 62E, 63A) also move between space and non-space duties during their careers, so SPDP certification timelines are not the same for all AFSCs.  SPDP certification criteria are summarized in Table 4.1. 4.2.  Certification  Levels.  The  three  levels  of  SPDP  certification  are  tailored  for  the  Total Force.    Space  professionals  progress  from  a  foundation  of  technical  competency  (Level  1), through demonstrated depth of knowledge and experience in application (Level 2), to extensive knowledge  and  experience  in  space  and  warfighting  operations  (Level  3).    Criteria  for  the various  levels  are  tied  to  education,  training  and  experience.    Level  1  is  normally  attained  in conjunction with Combat Mission Ready (CMR) status (or equivalent, for those not required to be CMR), Level 2 is normally attained at the officer and enlisted mid-grades, and Level 3 applies to more senior personnel. 4.3.  Certification Authority.  The SPFA is the overall authority for SPDP certification; at unit level  this responsibility resides with  the wing commander (or  equivalent).  Space professionals attain their certification levels by fulfilling the requirements for each phase. 4.4.  Duty  Requirements.  Only  space-related  duty  counts  toward  SPDP  certification.    Space-related duty consists of duties performed in AFSCs 13S, 14N, 15W, 33S, 61X, 62E, 63A, 1C6, 1W0, 3D1 and 1N0/1/2/4/5 in a space billet.   Individuals in AFSCs 14N, 15W, 33S, 61X, 62E, 63A,  1W0  and  1N0/1/2/4/5  with  no  space  experience  are  ineligible  for  SPDP  certification  (for example,  a  63A  officer  serving  in  an  aircraft  acquisition  position  in  Air  Force  Materiel Command will not accrue space experience credit). 4.5.  Certification  Requirements.  SPDP  certification  requirements  are  summarized  in  Table 4.1.  Civilian requirements are still in development.   20   AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010 Table 4.1.  SPDP Certification Requirements.  Officer Enlisted Level 1   Level 2   Level 3   UST (or equivalent)  CMR or equivalent (12 months in a space position for 15W, 33S & 6X; 14N:   12 months  and  SIFTU, 24 months without SIFTU)  SPDP Certification Briefing Space 200  Job-related training (CMR if applicable)  13S, 6X:  6 years of space duty   (5 years for 15W, 14N and 33S)  Space 300  Job-related training (CMR if applicable)  13S, 6X:  9 years of space duty (7 years for 15W, 14N and 33S) UST (or equivalent)  CMR or equivalent (12 months in a space position for 1W0;  1N0/1/2/4/5:  12 months  and  SIFTU,  24 months without SIFTU)  SPDP Certification Briefing Space 200  Job-related training (CMR if applicable)  6 years of space duty   (5 years for 1W0 and 1N0/1/2/4/5) Space 300  Job-related training (CMR if applicable)  9 years of space duty  (7 years for  1W0 and 1N0/1/2/4/5)  CCAF degree 4.6.  Decertification.  Decertification is an administrative action to remove an individual’s space professional  status  for cause.   It  is  not  a disciplinary action or a substitute for  action under the Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice.  A  space  professional  will  be  decertified  when  found professionally unqualified to perform space duties.  Decertification actions will be handled IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). 4.7.  Certification  Documentation.  The  SPMO  tracks  certification  in  coordination  with  each unit.  Since Level 1 is based on CMR (or equivalent), units must submit reports via e-mail by the 20th  of  each  month  to  ensure  the  SPMO  has  a  current  list  of  space  professionals  who  have attained Level 1 during the previous month.  Reports will include space professionals’ names and Social Security Account Numbers.  SPMO tracks Levels 2 and 3 and releases a monthly list on the  SPD  Website  indicating  space  professionals  who  attained  those  levels  during  the  previous month.    Units  must  contact  the  SPMO  in  the  event  a  space  professional  who  is  otherwise qualified  for  Level  2  or  3  is  considered  ineligible  for  progression  to  the  next  level  (e.g., decertification). 4.8.  Billet  Requirements.  SPDP  certification  requirements  also  apply  to  space  billets.    AF space-related  billets  include  any  jobs  focused  specifically  on  a  space  mission:    designing, integrating, operating, employing, sustaining, maintaining or supporting space systems within the DoD and selected government positions.  In instances where job requirements also include non-AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010   21  space  responsibilities,  the  billet  is  considered  a  space  billet  if  greater  than  50%  of  the  total responsibilities  are  space  related,  as  determined  by  the  SPMO  in  conjunction  with  the  owning unit.  For example, an Air Force Research Laboratory engineer position focused on development of thermal and acoustic protection devotes the majority (>50%) of effort on thermal applications for space systems, but also includes work on non-space systems.  SPDP and APDP certification requirements  may  apply  to  the  same  position;  certification  under  the  two  programs  is  different but compatible. 4.8.1.  Billet Information.  Once a billet has been identified as a space professional position, the  owning  organization  designates  a  SPDP  certification  level,  the  SPEC  earned  while assigned  to  the  position,  the  SPECs  required  for  selection  to  the  position,  a  position description (the duties of the position), job requirements (other information not captured by SPECs, e.g., security clearance), educational requirements, and CMR status. 4.8.2.  Billet  Changes.  When  an  organizational  mission  changes  (new  space  position, deletion of space position, or a change in mission that affects the assigned SPECs), units will contact  the  SPMO  and  provide  the  updated  data  for  the  billet(s).    SPMO  and  AFPC  teams will  periodically  crosscheck  billet  data  to  ensure  accurate  tracking  of  space  billet requirements. 4.9.  Waiver  procedures.  Each  space  billet  requires  a  specific  certification  level  and  may include experience, education and training prerequisites.  Space professionals selected for duty in these  billets  should  meet  the  requirements  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.    Specific  education, training  and  experience  prerequisites  are  addressed  by  the  hiring  authority  and  ATs  during  the assignment  process.    SPMO  and  AFPC  will  develop  and  maintain  a  process  to  place  space professionals who do not possess the required certification level in a position requiring a higher level.    ARC  waivers  must  comply  with  the  process  described  in  paragraph  5.7.    Waivers  for space professionals who have not attained the appropriate certification level must indicate when the individual is projected to attain the required level. 4.10.  Space Badge.  The Space Badge is worn by officer and enlisted space professionals.  The badge level is indicative of the wearer’s SPDP certification level.  The Basic Badge is awarded upon  completion  of  UST  and  related  IQT,  if  applicable  (or  after  UST  for  those  with  no  IQT requirement) and is  retained based on  attainment  of SPDP  certification  Level  1.   Award of the Senior and Command Space Badge is directly linked to SPDP certification and is not based on AFSC, time in service or skill level requirements.  The process described in paragraph 4.7 also applies to documentation of award of the corresponding Space Badge. Reference AFI 36-2903, Dress  and  Personal  Appearance  of  Air  Force  Personnel,  for  additional  information  on  the correct wear of the Space Badge. 4.10.1.  Eligibility.  Only  space  professionals  listed  in  paragraph  1.6  are  eligible  for  the Space Badge.  Exceptions to badge award must be approved by the SPFA.  Individuals who fail to meet all certification requirements are ineligible for award of the corresponding level of  the  Space  Badge.    This  includes  space  professionals  who  do  not  complete  Space  200  or 300  within  their  window  of  eligibility  (award  of  the  next  level  badge  is  attained  upon completion of the applicable course if all other criteria are met).  Commanders may request a waiver for badge award at the next level (see Attachment 3).  Commanders must make every effort to maintain the rigor associated with award of the badge.  Presenting a Space Badge is not  an  appropriate  method  of  recognizing  meritorious  service,  achievement  or  international   22  AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010 friendship.  Other Services and foreign military members may wear the Space Badge based on SPFA-approved criteria that maintain the structure and rigor of SPDP certification.  Once the  SPFA  has  approved  the  criteria,  the  Service/foreign  military  authority  may  award  the badge based on the criteria without further coordination  with  SPMO or SPFA.  Changes to award criteria will require SPFA approval. 4.10.2.  Prohibiting  the Wear  of  the  Space  Badge.  Space professionals earn the privilege of  permanently  wearing  the  badge  in  accordance  with  SPDP  certification.    In  most  cases, space  professionals  may  continue  to  wear  the  badge  even  if  decertified  or  retrained  to  a different career field. Situations may arise, however, when the continued wear of the Space Badge may be inappropriate. To ensure a consistent policy, adhere to the following guidance: 4.10.2.1.  Reasons  for  Prohibition.  Commanders  at  any level  may  recommend prohibiting wear of the Space Badge if an individual is decertified as a space professional for  failure  to  maintain  professional  standards.    In  all  cases,  prohibit  wear  of  the  Space Badge  when:  (a)  an  individual  is  decertified  for  discrediting  the  badge  through misconduct or willful violation of regulations or procedures, (b) unwillingness or failure to  perform  assigned  duties  (c)  when  the  individual  fails  to  become  a  productive  space professional through factors over which he or she has control—to include lack of effort or motivation. 4.10.2.2.  Authority.  The SPFA is the approval authority for Space Badge removal. The commander's recommendation must be forwarded to the SPMO for staffing to the SPFA (see  Attachment  4).    If  the  SPFA  determines  wear  of  the  Space  Badge  is  no  longer appropriate,  the  individual’s  record  will  be  annotated  accordingly  in  the  database,  e.g., "Member  is  no  longer  authorized  to  wear  the  Space  Badge  per  SPFA  memo, DDMMYY". AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010   23  Chapter 5 AIR RESERVE COMPONENT SPACE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  5.1.  ARC SPDP  is governed by guidelines that parallel the active duty SPDP but are tailored to allow ARC airmen to participate as equal partners in space missions.  The SPFA has Total Force responsibility for SPDP. 5.2.  ARC  members  must attain  the appropriate SPDP  certification level.  When in a CMR billet  space  professionals  must  attain  and  maintain  unit-specific  CMR  requirements  for  their assigned weapon system. 5.3.  ARC organizations will coordinate with the SPMO for ARC SPDP management.  The ARC will retain appropriate responsibility to develop their respective Total Force components to meet the SPDP needs. 5.4.  UST Requirement.  All ARC space professionals must attend UST upon entering the 13S and 1C6 career fields; 61X, 62E and 63A officers will also attend UST when assigned to space billets,  depending  on  available  class  seats.    Space  professionals  in  14N,  15W,  33S,  1W0  and 1N01/2/4/5 will attend applicable space education for their AFSCs (see Table 3.1.). 5.5.  Good  Year  Credit.  An ARC good year consists of a minimum of 24 days of duty for an Individual  Mobilization Augmentee  and  36  days  of  duty  for  a  Traditional  Unit  Reservist.    The ARC must report good year status to the SPMO for accurate tracking of ARC space professional currency. 5.6.  Tracking.  The  SPMO  will  track  ARC  space  professionals  using  data  from  separate  Air Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  and  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  databases,  working  in coordination with applicable ARC organizations. 5.6.1.  AFRC  will  maintain  its  MilPDS  database  but  allow  SPMO  access  via  AFRC/A1 representatives at HQ AFPC.  AFRC will work with SPMO to ensure space professional data is accurate and compatible with the active duty databases. 5.6.2.  The  ANG  will  allow  SPMO  access  to  ANG  data  for  identification  and  tracking  of ANG space professionals. 5.7.  ARC  Senior  Leader  Review  Boards  (SLRB)  will  provide  policy  recommendations  and personnel  utilization  inputs  to  their  respective  component  commanders  for  approval  and submission to the SPFA for final review and approval. 5.7.1.  The  AFRC  SLRB  is  chaired  by  HQ  AFRC/A3T,  with  the  310th  Space  Wing commander  and  HQ  AFSPC/CR  as  voting  members  and  HQ  AFRC/A1T  and  SPMO advisors.    The  SLRB  will  meet  semi-annually  to  review  the  space  professional  inventory, identify  space  professionals  and  key  billets  across  AFRC  and  the  associated  SPDP certification  level  for  those  billets,  evaluate  records  of  AFRC  space  professionals,  and prioritize AFRC candidates for space education. The SLRB will make recommendations for waivers  to  allow  individuals  to  fill  a  position  without  the  required  SPDP  certification  level and  the  associated  process  to  make  that  decision.    All  SLRB  decisions  will  be  coordinated through HQ AFRC/A3 and HQ AFSPC/CC MA to HQ AFRC/CV and HQ AFRC/CC, then   24  AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010 to  the  SPFA  for  approval.  If  AFRC  issues  arise  during  coordination,  the  SLRB  will reconvene to resolve/update recommendations. 5.7.2.  The ANG SLRB will accomplish the personnel items identified in paragraph 5.7.1 for ANG  space  professionals.    The  SLRB  will  be  chaired  by  the  Weapon  System  Council representative  for  Space  with  additional  voting  members  consisting  of  a  senior-level  space representative from the field units, ANG/A3S and HQ AFSPC/CG.  The SLRB will have an advisory  member  from  SPMO  and  will  meet  semi-annually.    All  SLRB  decisions  will  be presented by HQ AFSPC/CG for approval by the SPFA. AFI36-3701  20 MAY 2010   25  Chapter 6 SPACE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM METRICS 6.1.  Metrics Review.  The SPMO tracks pertinent SPDP data and reviews metrics derived from the data on a quarterly basis to monitor the health of the space professional inventory and SPDP effectiveness.  Each  year the SPMO will conduct comprehensive data analysis of the inventory by billets and individuals to provide a complete assessment to the SPFA, SPFAAC, SAAB and DTs, as required. 6.2.  Baseline  data  are  used  to  define  the  space  professional  inventory,  tracking  space professionals  by  certification  level,  AFSC,  SPEC  and  rank  in  various  combinations.    Space billets are also tracked in the same categories. 6.3.  SPMO  Assessment.  Comparison  of  total  space  billet  requirements  (the  demand)  to  the space  professional  population  (the  supply)  provides  a  means  to  determine  if  the  manpower structure and personnel inventory are sufficient to meet current and future mission needs.  SPMO assesses  accurate  utilization  of  space  professionals  by  contrasting  specific  billet  requirements with the qualifications of the individual space professional assigned to each position. 6.4.  Space Education Programs  Timeliness  is tracked by monitoring the percentage of space professionals  completing  Space  200  and  300  within  their  window  of  eligibility  and  success  at meeting  requirements  of  the  other  services  and  government  agencies.    NSSI  and  ASOpS curriculum metrics ensure courses satisfy objectives provided by functional stakeholders. 6.5.  Periodic  Assessment.  SPMO  will  complete  a  periodic  assessment  of  the  accuracy  and effectiveness  of  the  metrics  in  measuring  program  success  and  the  analysis  methodology  and make  adjustments  as  required.    Results  of  the  assessment  and  the  annual  data  analysis  will  be presented to the SPFAAC for approval and feedback. 6.6.  NSSO  Report.  SPMO  also  provides  data  to  the  NSSO  in  response  to  reporting requirements to Congress as prescribed in the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act. 6.7.  Prescribed and Adopted Forms. 6.7.1.  Prescribed forms: AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication 6.7.2.  Adopted Forms. None.  RICHARD Y.
