RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication. OPR:   AF/A10-S Supersedes:   AFMAN 10-2605, 30 June 2008 Certified by: AF/A10-S (Mr Richard Benson) Pages: 142 AFMAN  10-2605,  Education,  Training,  and  Exercise  (ETE)  Competencies  for  Counter-Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  (C-CBRN)  Operations,  sets  forth  the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) crucial to effective C-CBRN operations. These C-CBRN ETE  KSAs,  herein  referred  to  as  competencies,  are  an  integral  component  of  institutional  Air Force  C-CBRN  operational  capability.  AFMAN  10-2605  implements  elements  of  Air  Force Policy  Directive  (AFPD)  10-26,  Counter-Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological  and  Nuclear Operations, and AFPD 10-25, Emergency Management; and reflects Air Force Doctrine Annex 3-40, C-CBRN Operations and guidance within Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. The  five  doctrinal  pillars  of  Air  Force  C-CBRN  operations  defined  in  Annex  3-40  organize unique  Air  Force  operational  capabilities  that  support  the  three  sets  of  countering  weapons  of mass  destruction  (CWMD)  activities  (synchronizing,  foundational,  and  specialized)  within  the Department of Defense Strategy for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (DODS CWMD) and  the  three  pillars  of  the  National  Strategy  to  Combat  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction.  The competencies  and  associated  levels  of  learning  and  proficiency  codes  within  this  manual contribute  to  Air  Force  operational  capability.  These  Air  Force-approved  C-CBRN  ETE competencies  provide  commanders,  educators,  trainers,  and  exercise  developers  with  valuable tools  to  effectively  perform  CWMD  operations  and  continue  mission  operations  in  a  chemical, biological,  radiological,  and  nuclear  (CBRN)  environment.  While  focused  at  Headquarters  Air Force,  Major  Commands  (MAJCOM),  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOA),  and  Direct  Reporting   2  AFMAN10-2605  24 APRIL 2015 Units  (DRU),  this  manual  applies  to  all  units  and  ETE  stakeholder  activities  under  Air  Force command and control to include the Air National Guard.  At foreign locations, this manual applies to the extent consistent with local conditions and treaty requirements,  agreements,  and  other  arrangements  with  foreign  governments  and  allied  forces. The  authorities  to  waive  wing/unit  level  requirements  in  this  publication  are  identified  with  a Tier  (“T-0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3”)  number  following  the  compliance  statement.  See  AFI  33-360, Publications  and  Forms  Management,  Table  1.1  for  a  description  of  the  authorities  associated with the Tier numbers. When complying with official policy, guidance, and/or procedures, a unit may  request  a  waiver.  The  fundamental  aim  of  a  waiver  must  be  to  enhance  mission effectiveness at all levels, while preserving resources and safeguarding health and welfare. When a commander approves a waiver, the commander is communicating to subordinates and superiors that the commander accepts the risk created by non-compliance. Each requirement mandated for compliance  at  the  Wing  level  found  within  this  manual  is  tiered,  signifying  the  appropriate waiver authority to the requirement. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to  the  appropriate  Tier  waiver  approval  authority,  or  alternately,  to  the  Publication  Office  of Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  for  non-tiered  compliance  items.  This  publication  may  be supplemented at any level. Direct Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to certification and approval.  Ensure  that  all  records  created  as  a  result  of  processes  prescribed  in  this  publication  are maintained in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management  of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil.

Strategic  Overview.  The  National  Strategy  to  Combat  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction, published in 2002, describes three pillars of CWMD: nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and consequence  management.  The  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  accomplishes  these  national strategy  pillars  through  three  sets  of  CWMD  activities  identified  in  the  DODS  CWMD.  First, DOD  must  synchronize  CWMD  efforts  across  the  operational  spectrum.  Second,  DOD  must maintain  and  expand  foundational  CWMD-specific  expertise  and  cooperate  with  and  support partners. Finally, DOD must continue to develop and expand specialized CWMD capabilities to understand,  control,  defeat,  disable,  or  dispose  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  (WMD)  threats while  safeguarding  the  force  and  managing  the  consequences  of  WMD  use.  Similarly,  the  five doctrinal  pillars  of  Air  Force  C-CBRN  operations  codified  by  Annex  3-40,  published  in  2007, support  the  three  sets  of  CWMD  activities  and  the  three  national  pillars.  The  five  Air  Force doctrinal  pillars  are:  proliferation  prevention  (PP),  counterforce  (CF),  active  defense  (AD), passive  defense  (PD),  and  consequence  management  (CM).  Underpinning  these  pillars  are strategic  enablers  (EN)  to  enhance  Air  Force  contributions  to  countering  CBRN  threats.  The competencies  within  Attachment  2  of  this  manual  contribute  directly  to  Air  Force  C-CBRN operational capability. 1.2.  Doctrinal Pillars of C-CBRN Operations.  As explained in Air Force doctrine, the pillars are  mutually  supporting  and  reinforcing,  forming  an  overlapping  and  interlinked  operational spectrum. Activities and operations falling within one of the doctrinal pillars may be conducted concurrently with activities and operations supporting one of the other doctrinal pillars. 1.2.1.  Proliferation  Prevention.  Those  actions  (e.g.,  diplomacy,  arms  control,  multilateral agreements, threat reduction assistance, export controls and interdiction) taken to prevent or limit the spread of WMD. By dissuading or impeding access to, or distribution of, sensitive technologies,  materials  or  expertise,  the  Air  Force  can  reduce  the  potential  for  adversary acquisition  and  use  of  WMD.  Air  Force  PP  capabilities  include  detecting,  deterring,  and denying an adversary’s acquisition of CBRN weapons and components, via robust air, space, and  cyberspace  power  capabilities.  These  capabilities  help  ensure  prohibited  technologies and materials do not get into the hands of potential adversaries or states potentially hostile to the U.S. 1.2.2.  Counterforce. CF operations provide combatant commanders with the ability to defeat the  full  suite  of  CBRN  capabilities  before  they  can  be  used  against  U.S.  interests,  while minimizing  collateral  effects.  CF  operations  aim  to  detect,  deter,  deny,  degrade,  or  destroy adversary  CBRN  capabilities,  including  research  and  development,  production,  storage facilities, fielded forces, and related command and control. 1.2.3.  Active Defense. AD operations attempt to intercept CBRN weapons  en route to their targets.  Successful AD operations can complement  CF activities by forcing an adversary to alter  attack  strategies  and  expose  CBRN  assets.  If  CF  operational  capabilities  are unsuccessful  or  unavailable,  successful  AD  operations  can  reduce  the  threat,  lessen  the number of attacks, thwart  an attack, allow more  effective passive defense and  consequence management responses, and enhance U.S./coalition operational capability following a CBRN AFMAN10-2605  24 APRIL 2015   5  attack. Effective AD measures take into account  AD capability sets (i.e., detect, divert, and destroy)  with  various  planning  considerations  for  each  of  the  layered-defense  domains (i.e., air,  land,  sea,  space,  and  cyberspace).  This  layered  defense  approach  incorporates networked systems, and employs both kinetic and non-kinetic means of defeat. 1.2.4.  Passive Defense. CBRN PD measures improve the abilities of personnel, equipment, and  assets  to  survive  and  sustain  operations  in  a  contaminated  environment.  PD  measures maximize  the  ability  to  survive  and  operate  in  a  contaminated  environment  through  proper planning, training,  risk  assessment,  and  vulnerability  and  hazard  mitigation.  All activities/measures fall under one or more components of the PD framework, which consists of sense, shape, shield and sustain. 1.2.5.  Consequence Management. CM activities serve to reduce the impact from an incident involving  CBRN  agents/materials  and  assist  in  the  restoration  of  essential  operations  and services at home and abroad in a permissive environment. Regardless of the specific CBRN incident  involved,  there  are  effectively  three  phases  to  dealing  with  the  post-attack consequences  of  an  event:    casualty  management,  remediation  of  the  affected  area,  and restoration of essential services. 1.2.6.  Strategic  Enablers.  EN  activities,  although  not  part  of  the  five  doctrinal  pillars,  are essential elements to the successful execution of many C-CBRN activities and operations that make  up  the  five  doctrinal  pillars.  EN  activities  include  the  collection,  exploitation,  and dissemination  of  CBRN  intelligence  data;  the  formation  and  sustainment  of  international partnerships; and strategic communications. 1.3.  C-CBRN  ETE  Integrated  Operational  Context.  A  robust  C-CBRN  operational capability for the Air Force is not achieved through a single individual or skill-level, nor is it the responsibility  of  a  single  functional  community.  C-CBRN  capability  is  realized  through  a  life-cycle  approach  using  Force  Development  principles  to  create  an  integrated  whole-base capability. It is not developed as the result of a single lesson, schoolhouse, or exercise event, but rather  the  culmination  of  growing  CBRN-smart  Airmen  capable  of  owning  this  operational environment regardless of an adversary’s intent, will, possession, or use of CBRN weapons. To facilitate  and  achieve  this  operational  objective,  five  targeted  audiences  are  defined  to  manage and  institutionalize  the  necessary  KSAs  that  ultimately  enable  and  sustain  an  integrated operational  capability.  Figure  1.1  provides  a  graphic  depiction  of  an  integrated  operational context.   6  AFMAN10-2605  24 APRIL 2015 Figure 1.1.  Integrated Operational Context  1.3.1.  Senior Leadership. Those with command authority and responsibility for directing C-CBRN  operations.  The  O-6  plus  category  shown  within  the  grade-band  architecture  in Attachment  4  is  recommended  to  produce  Air  Force  leaders  who  understand  the  CBRN environment and apply effective operational risk management decisions. 1.3.2.  Functional  Specific.  Those  classified  within  certain  Air  Force  Specialty  Codes (AFSC) with sufficient knowledge of and competence in their C-CBRN tasks in functionally-driven tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). In essence, this enables those who perform functional skills that ensure critical operations (e.g., sortie generation, cargo throughput, etc.) to  conduct  those  operations  within  a  CBRN  environment.  Grade  bands  recommended  in Attachment 4 closely correlate to Air Force skill-levels. 1.3.3.  Individual.  The  basic  building  block  upon  which  all  C-CBRN  capability  is  realized. This is where the preponderance of Airmen, regardless of rank or AFSC affiliation, possesses sufficient knowledge of and competence in their ability to operate in a CBRN environment. To ensure the ability to not only survive, but to operate in a CBRN environment, our Airmen need the broadest foundational (or universal) level of understanding and ability. 1.3.4.  Specialized  Expertise.  Those  within  certain  United  States  Air  Force  (USAF) communities who provide the underpinning science, equipment acquisition and procurement, or innovative solutions to defeat the CBRN challenge. AFMAN10-2605  24 APRIL 2015   7  1.3.5.  Civilians and Contractors. Should have a well-established understanding of C-CBRN operations  consistent  with  their  duties  and  responsibilities.  This  AFMAN  identifies competencies for emergency-essential and non-emergency-essential civilians and contractors. Attachment  4  delineates  competencies  that  may  apply  to  civilian  employees  (emergency-essential,  non-emergency  essential,  and  senior  leaders)  and  to  contractor  employees performing both emergency-essential and non-emergency-essential contractor services. Note: While  this  AFMAN  identifies  ETE  competencies  appropriate  for  contractor  employees,  it does  not  alter  ETE  responsibilities  for  any  particular  contract  or  contractor  employee;  ETE recommendations  should  be  implemented  through  the  applicable  contract.  Civilian  and contractor ETE recommendations are commensurate with that of their military counterparts. 1.3.6.  Dependents.  All  dependents  should  have  a  basic  understanding  of  the  hazards associated  with  the  area  they  live  in  and  should  understand  basic  protective  actions.  This information  should  be  included  in  Base  Emergency  Preparedness  Orientation  training  IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. 1.4.  C-CBRN  ETE  Methodology.  The  Air  Force  C-CBRN  Council  employed  a  four-step methodology  to  institutionalize  an  Air  Force  C-CBRN  operational  capability:  competency development; baseline evaluation; gap identification/assessment; and implementation. Iterations of the C-CBRN ETE methodology are conducted on a three-year basis, or as directed by the Air Force C-CBRN Council. 1.4.1.  Competency Development. A measurable cluster of KSAs, or other attributes that an individual should possess to successfully perform consistent with a given task, condition, and standard. 1.4.1.1.  Focus  Working  Group.  AF/A3/5  convened  a  focus  working  group  of  selected subject  matter  experts  (SME)  whose  knowledge,  experience,  and  responsibilities contribute directly to C-CBRN operational capability. The SMEs identified the KSAs that should be taught, trained, and exercised by the Air Force to realize its desired C-CBRN operational  capabilities.  The  focus  working  group  generated  an  initial  C-CBRN  ETE competency list (CL). 1.4.1.2.  Competency  List  Roll-Up.  Once  the  focus  working  group  produced  the  initial CL, the specific C-CBRN ETE competencies were edited for redundancy and accuracy. Each competency from the initial CL was then assessed for its contribution to operational capability and mission accomplishment as the primary criteria. 1.4.1.3.  ETE  Proficiency  Recommendations.  Education  levels  of  learning  and  training proficiency  codes  were  determined  and  applied  against  appropriate  Air  Force  grade band(s)  (e.g.,  E-1  –  E-3)  for  each  competency.  In  addition,  SMEs  examined  each  C-CBRN ETE competency to determine whether the knowledge or skill should be exercised and  by  which  group(s).  Attachment  4  details  the  recommended  levels  of  learning  and proficiency  codes,  and  articulates  exercise  recommendations  for  each  C-CBRN  ETE competency.  Note:    A  number  of  the  recommendations  reflect  group  competencies  and the  team  application  of  knowledge  and  skills.  These  exercise-only  competencies  (See Paragraph 1.7) do not provide individual training and education recommendations. 1.4.1.4.  Mission-to-Task  Alignment.  A  thorough  analysis  of  C-CBRN  related  core guidance  documents  yielded  a  comprehensive  list  of  tasks  that  should  be  performed  to   8  AFMAN10-2605  24 APRIL 2015 sustain  mission  operations  regardless  of  CBRN  threats  and/or  contamination.  SMEs aligned  the  C-CBRN  doctrinal  activities  to  unit  tasks  codified  in  the  AFUTL.  C-CBRN ETE competencies that support an essential AFUTL task, and subsequently contribute to the accomplishment of C-CBRN doctrinal operations, were retained in the final CL roll-up. Note: this analysis followed a mission-to-task methodology, which provided a direct linkage  from  the  overarching  mission  down  to  the  underlying  ETE  recommendations. Attachment 3 details the AFUTL task linkages for each C-CBRN ETE competency. 1.4.2.  Baseline Evaluation. Education and training stakeholders determined the current level of C-CBRN ETE within their domain. 1.4.3.  Gap  Identification  and  Assessment.  Education  and  training  stakeholders  compared existing baselines with defined C-CBRN ETE competencies to identify shortfalls within their domain.  The  gap  assessment  provided  potential  corrective  actions  and  identified  resources recommended to eliminate the shortfalls. 1.4.4.  Implementation.  An  approved  implementation  plan  completes  the  C-CBRN  ETE methodology by outlining steps necessary to institutionalize KSAs contributing to Air Force C-CBRN operational capability. 1.5.  Competency  Application.  The  C-CBRN  ETE  recommended  competencies  herein represent  the  KSAs  that  apply  to  Senior  Leaders  and  Individuals  (Airmen),  regardless  of functional  specialty. Some apply to  Airmen at  all grade levels,  some apply to  a broad range of grade levels, and others apply to a narrow range of grade levels. In addition, select competencies apply  to  emergency-essential  and  non-emergency-essential  civilians  and  contractors,  and dependents.  Educators,  trainers,  and  exercise  planners  may  integrate  the  C-CBRN  ETE competencies most appropriate for their operational or functional needs, refer to Attachment 4. (T-1) 1.5.1.  Though  some  C-CBRN  ETE  competencies  appear  to  be  functionally  specific  in nature, the intent was to identify universal KSAs and create C-CBRN ETE competencies that apply broadly across the Air Force. 1.5.2.  Air  Force  Career  Field  Managers  (AFCFM)  should  determine  the  C-CBRN  ETE competencies that apply to their specific career field, and incorporate them into their existing Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  as  foundational  KSAs.  To  aid  the AFCFMs  in  this  task,  related  references  for  each  C-CBRN  ETE  competency  are  listed  in Attachment 3. 1.5.3.  Competencies  should  be  used  to  develop  AFSC-awarding  courses,  as  appropriate. New C-CBRN training that is non-AFSC-specific should be vetted and approved through the corporate review process detailed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. 1.6.  Educational Levels of Learning and Training Proficiency Codes.  The educational levels of  learning  in  this  manual  use  an  adaptation  of  Bloom’s  cognitive  taxonomy  as  outlined  in AFMAN  36-2236,  Guidebook  for  Air  Force  Instructors.  The  training  proficiency  codes  follow the  guidance  contained  in  AFI  36-2201.  Both  the  recommended  levels  of  learning  and recommended proficiency codes for the C-CBRN ETE competencies are outlined in Attachment 4.  The  C-CBRN  ETE  competencies  and  educational/training  levels  of  learning  represent  Air Force  recommendations  that  should  be  met  collectively  through  various  education  and  training venues across the Air Force, including formal education and technical training; MAJCOM-level, AFMAN10-2605  24 APRIL 2015   9  base-level,  other  Service,  and  other  federal  agency  education  and  training;  and  appropriate civilian  academic  institutions.  NOTE:  The  Air  Force  Learning  Committee  (AFLC)  has  senior leader  oversight  of  any  changes  to  the  established  institutional  competency  development programs'  (ICDP)  curriculum  baseline  requirements.  Submit  any  requests  for  changes  to professional  military  education  (PME),  AF  commissioning  programs,  and  Basic  Military Training (BMT) curricula as outlined in AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education. 1.7.  Exercise Competencies.  The exercise C-CBRN ETE competencies listed in Attachment 4 may  be  incorporated  into  exercises,  war  games,  and  experiments  to  validate  education  and training programs and allow individuals to demonstrate their learned skills. 1.8.  Air  Force  Institutional  Competency  List  (ICL).  The  C-CBRN  ETE  competencies contained in Attachment 2 support the Air Force Institutional Competency Employing Military Capabilities as outlined in the Air Force ICL.   10  AFMAN10-2605  24 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

AFCFMs  should  ensure  that curriculum  developers  and  lesson  planners  for  all  AFSC-awarding  courses  use  the  specific competency  recommendations  applicable  to  their  students  and  monitor  incorporation  into  the appropriate  course  materials.  ETE  stakeholders  may  exceed  these  recommended  standards  at their discretion as they view the competencies’ applicability to their respective functional area(s) or  mission(s).  All  competencies  contribute  to  the  Air  Force’s  ability  to  operate  in  any  CBRN environment. The C-CBRN ETE competencies were revised from their original form through a mission-to-task  analysis  process.  This  mission-to-task-to-educate-and-train  methodology provides  a  direct  linkage  from  the  overarching  mission  down  to  the  underlying  C-CBRN  ETE recommendations.  Analysis  of  C-CBRN-related  core  guidance  documents  yielded  a comprehensive list of recommendations and tasks that should be performed to accomplish the C-CBRN  mission.  These  doctrinal  activities  are  aligned  to  unit  tasks  as  codified  in  the  AFUTL. The  resulting  C-CBRN  ETE  competencies  support  these  AFUTL  tasks  and  contribute  to  the accomplishment of the C-CBRN doctrinal operations. See Attachment 3 for associated AFUTLs and doctrinal references. The C-CBRN ETE competencies are aligned to the Air Force doctrinal pillars  identified  in  Annex  3-40:  proliferation  prevention,  counterforce,  active  defense,  passive defense, and consequence management; supported by the cross-cutting capabilities of  strategic enablers. The C-CBRN ETE competencies for C-CBRN operations contained within this manual supersede any preceding AF/A3/5-approved C-CBRN ETE competencies.
