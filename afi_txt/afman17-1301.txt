In accordance with DoDI 8100.04, use/obtain UC products certified by the DISA Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), JITC certifies interoperability and the UC-implementing DoD component  AO or the DISA Certifying Authority (CA) certifies  for Cybersecurity  under  RMF.    Approved  products  are  listed  on  the  DISA  UC  Approved Products List (APL) (https://aplits.disa.mil/processAPList.action) and should be added to the enclave security authorization package and assessed for Cybersecurity through the RMF process. 3.5.4.2.  As  a  general  rule,  Section  508-compatible  Voice  over  Internet  Protocol  (VoIP) devices are not listed on the DISA UC APL unless the vendor has included the assistive technology  (AT)  end  device  as  part  of  the  VoIP  system’s  evaluation  package.  Organizations  may  request  that  the  vendor  add  the  product  to  the  current  UC  APL certification package and request a “desktop review” from the DISA Unified Capabilities Certification  Office  (UCCO).    The  DISA  UCCO  (Email:  disa.meade.ns.list.unified-capabilities-certification-office@mail.mil)  has  a  listing  of  all  product  representatives.  This  review  ensures  the  product  operates  with  the  current  fielded  VoIP  system.    If  the vendor is unable or unwilling to add the AT product to the UC APL certification, identify compliance with AFMAN 17-1202 in the enclave/IS security authorization package. 3.5.4.3.  All  Air  Force  VTC  suites  are  transitioning  off  the  Integrated  Services  Digital Network  (ISDN)-based  Defense  Information  System  Network  (DISN)  Video  Service-Global  (DVS-G)  to  Global  Video  Services  (GVS),  IAW  Maintenance  Tasking  Order (MTO)  2014-295-001.    AF  organizations  should  not  expend  funds  on  the  upgrade, replacement,  and  acquisition  of  voice,  video,  and/or  data  services  equipment  outside  of the GVS program. 3.5.5.  Cloud  Services.    Acquire  and  implement  private  and/or  public  cloud  computing services in support of the Air Force Information Network (AFIN) IAW AFI 17-100. 3.5.6.  Foreign  produced  products.

Introduction.  AF  ISs  connect  to  the  DoD  Information  Network  (DoDIN)  subnetworks (e.g.,  SIPRNet,  Non-classified  Internet  Protocol  Router  Network  [NIPRNet],  GVS,  etc.)  IAW Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6211.02, Defense Information Systems Network  (DISN)  Responsibilities.    Every  individual  who  has  access  to  standalone  systems, specialized/functional ISs, enterprise ISs, and/or mission systems is an IS user. 4.1.1.  Access to AF ISs is a revocable privilege and is granted to individuals based on need to know and IAW National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Policy (NSTISSP) No. 200, National Policy on Controlled Access Protection; DoD 5200.2-R,  Personnel  Security  Program;  and  CJCSI  6510.01,  Information  Assurance  (IA)  and Support  to  Computer  Network  Defense  (CND).    Follow  procedural  guidance  in  MPTO  00-33B-5004. 4.1.2.  The  Information  System  Owner  (ISO)  ensures  methods  are  in  place  to  verify  user access  requests  before  granting  IS  access.    Address  delegation  of  authority  for  specific system/enclave access in the system authorization package. 4.2.  Authorized  Users.  An authorized user is  any appropriately  cleared individual required to access  a  DoD  IS  to  carry  out  or  assist  in  a  lawful  and  authorized  governmental  function.  Configure authorized user account creation and administration using role-based access schemes; see  AFMAN  17-1201,  User  Responsibilities  and  Guidance  for  Information  Systems.    Consult AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, for investigation requirements for access to an Automated Information System (AIS) position, as outlined in DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix 10. 4.2.1.  All  authorized  users  (e.g.,  military,  civilian,  contractor,  temporary  employees, volunteers,  interns,  key  spouses,  and  American  Red  Cross  personnel)  will  complete CyberAwareness  Challenge  training  prior  to  being  granted  access  to  an  IS.    (T-0).    Users annually  re-accomplish  CyberAwareness  Challenge training;  organizations  maintain compliance IAW DoD 8570.01-M.  Authorized user access to unclassified and classified ISs based on the assigned duties and the Automated Data Processing (ADP) position  categories identified in DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix 10:  Category ADP-III (also referred to as IT-III) are nonsensitive positions. 4.2.1.1.  CyberAwareness  Challenge  training  is  located  on  the  Advanced  Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) accessible via the AF Portal. 4.2.1.2.  A  publically  accessible  version  of  the  CyberAwareness  Challenge  training  is located  on  the  DISA  website  (http://iase.disa.mil).    Users  without  an  ADLS  account may substitute this training for initial network access. 4.2.1.3.  When  a  user  requires  a  new/modification  to  his/her  account  (due  to  change  of station  or  assignment,  Temporary  Duty  [TDY],  etc.),  the  gaining  CSS  verifies  the  user meets  access  requirements  before  granting  access  to  the  IS.    Users  are  not  required  to retake the CyberAwareness Challenge training provided the user has a valid and current (within  a  year)  course  completion  record.    Verification  of  completion  may  be AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 15 accomplished using the printed or electronic copy of CyberAwareness Challenge training certificate from DISA or ADLS or confirmation by the CSS. 4.2.1.4.  System access  by  authorized users requires PKI  access  methods as specified in DoDI 8520.03, Identity Authentication for Information Systems, and CJCSI 6510.01. 4.2.2.  Privileged  User.    Grant  privileged  access  to  unclassified  and  classified  ISs  based  on the assigned duties and the ADP position categories identified in DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix 10: Category ADP-I (also referred to as IT-I) are Privileged positions and Category ADP-II (also referred to as IT-II) are Limited Privileged positions. 4.2.2.1.  Administrative  and  privileged  accounts  require  PKI  user  authentication  IAW United  States  Cyber  Command  (USCYBERCOM)  Tasking  Order  (TASKORD)  2015-0102,  Implementation  and  Reporting  of  DoD  Public  Key  Infrastructure  (PKI)  System Administrator and Privileged User Authentication. 4.2.2.2.  Privileged  users  should  meet  all  the  requirements  of  an  authorized  user  as specified in AFMAN 17-1303 and paragraph 4.2.1. 4.2.2.3.  Privileged  users  are  established  and  administered  with  a  role-based  access scheme IAW the system policy and Chapter 3 of DoD 5200.2-R and AFMAN 17-1303. 4.2.2.4.  System  access  requires  PKI  access  methods  as  specified  in  DoDI  8520.03  and CJCSI 6510.01. 4.2.2.5.  Privileged  users  access  only  data,  control  information,  software,  hardware,  and firmware that they are authorized access and fulfills the “need to know” requirement. 4.2.2.6.  To  maintain  separation  of  duties  and  least  privilege,  users  maintain  separate accounts,  a  user  account  for  day-to-day  or  “non-privileged”  functions,  and  a  privileged account for administrative functions IAW DoD 8570.01-M. 4.2.2.7.  Prohibit sharing of privileged user accounts and credentials between users. 4.2.2.8.  Configure privileged user remote access  IAW the applicable DISA STIGs (i.e., Enclave,  Operating  System,  Remote  Access,  Directory  Services  Domain,  etc.)  and  the selected security controls within the RMF package. 4.2.2.9.  Privileged users are position-certified IAW DoD 8570.01-M and qualified IAW AFMAN 17-1303. 4.2.2.10.  Privileged users complete an Information System Privileged Access Agreement and Acknowledgement of Responsibilities IAW DoD 8570.01-M (Appendix 4). 4.2.3.  Foreign Nationals/Local Nationals.  A FN/LN user is anyone who is not a US citizen or permanent resident, IAW Title 8, Code of Federal Regulations, Aliens and Nationality. 4.2.3.1.  The  MAJCOM  FDO  determines  authorized  and  privileged  “need  to  know”  for the administrative access and control of information, software, hardware and firmware to include controlled unclassified information (CUI) and classified information, IAW DoD Manual  (DoDM)  5200.01,  Volume  4,  DoD  Information  Security  Program:  Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). 4.2.3.1.1.  WCOs  consult  the  Host  or  MAJCOM  FDO  and  applicable  ISSM  before authorizing  access  by  FN/LN  users  to  ISs  processing,  storing,  or  transmitting 16 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 classified  and  CUI.    Note:    Specific  FN/LN  access  guidance  can  be  found  in  the following  publications:  MPTO  00-33A-1301,  Foreign  National  NIPRNet  Access Core Services; MPTO 00-33B-5004; MPTO 00-33B-5006; MPTO 00-33A-1202, Air Force  Network  Account  Management;  MPTO  00-33D-2001,  AFNET  Enterprise Services  Naming  Conventions;  AFI  16-107,  Military  Personnel  Exchange  Program; AFI  16-201,  Air  Force  Foreign  Disclosure  and  Technology  Transfer  Program; DoDD 5230.25, Withholding of Unclassified Technical Data from Public Disclosure; DoDD  5400.7,  DoD  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  Program;  DoD  5400.7-R_AFMAN  33-302,  Freedom  of  Information  Act  Program;  AFI  33-332,  Air  Force Privacy  and  Civil  Liberties  Program;  DoDD  5230.11,  Disclosure  of  Classified Military  Information  to  Foreign  Governments  and  International  Organizations;  and DoDD 5230.20, Visits and Assignments of Foreign Nationals. 4.2.3.1.2.  Pursuant to applicable host-nation agreements, FN/LN privileged users are certified  to  baseline  computing  environment  (CE)  IAW  DoD  8570.01-M.    If privileged  access  is  required  to  an  IS,  restrict  FN/LN  user  access  to  IAT  I/II  level positions  and  only  under  the  immediate  supervision  of  a  US  citizen.    Furthermore, document access in the IS security assessment package. 4.2.3.1.3.  At  the  discretion  of  the  ISO,  FN/LN  system  access  requires  PKI  access methods as specified in Chapter 8. 4.2.3.1.4.  Sanitize  or  configure  classified  ISs  to  restrict  access  by  FN/LNs  to  only classified  information  authorized  for  disclosure  to  the  FN/LNs  government  or coalition,  as  necessary  to  fulfill  the  terms  of  their  assignments  IAW  applicable  host MAJCOM FDO requirements. 4.2.3.1.5.  Other Considerations.  Non-US citizens who are permanent legal residents are  required  to  meet  the  same  requirements  of  any  US  citizen  for  access  to  the unclassified network or system, as outlined in paragraph 4.2.1. 4.2.3.2.  Before  authorizing  FN/LN  access  to  unclassified  ISs,  the  ISO  ensures compliance with the IS access requirements in MPTO 00-33A-1301. 4.2.4.  Group  Accounts.    The  Enterprise  AO  (or  applicable  AO  if  entirely  within  their boundary)  is  the  approving  authority  for  group  accounts  and  may  require  a  Defense Information  Assurance  Security  Accreditation  Working  Group  (DSAWG)  waiver  IAW CJCSI  6510.01  and  DoDI  8520.02,  Public  Key  Infrastructure  (PKI)  and  Public  Key  (PK) Enabling.  Document authorization in the system/enclave authorization package. 4.2.4.1.  Requests  for  group  accounts  using  individual/unique  authentication  should  be submitted via email to AFSPC CYSS/CYZ PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil). 4.2.4.2.  Group  accounts  that  do  not  use  an  individual/unique  authenticator  require DSAWG  approval.    To  submit  requests  to  the  DSAWG  for  approval,  contact  AFSPC CYSS/CYZ PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil).   AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 17 4.2.5.  Temporary and Volunteer Accounts.  Grant only unclassified IS access to temporary employees and volunteer personnel in support of their assigned duties. 4.2.5.1.  A  volunteer  is  any  individual  (including  key  spouses)  authorized  to  be  DoD volunteers as defined in DoDI 1100.21, Voluntary Services in the Department of Defense.  Restrict volunteers to ADP-III/IT-III level positions IAW DoDI 5200.2-R, Appendix 10. 4.2.5.2.  Temporary  employees  and  volunteers  are  required  to  meet  the  requirements  as specified in paragraph 4.2.1. 4.2.5.3.  Temporary  employees  and  volunteers  require  PKI  access  as  outlined  in  Chapter 8. 4.3.  Required Account Access Documentation 4.3.1.  When required by the ISO for IS access, the CSS or ISSO ensures the DD Form 2875, System  Authorization  Access  Request  (SAAR),  is  completed  and  signed.    Document  access requests,  Annual  Information  Awareness  (CyberAwareness  Challenge)  training  completion, and justification for access and clearance/background investigation verification as referenced by  DoD  5200.2-R  and  AFI  31-501.    DD  Form  2875  signatures  can  be  “wet”  or  digitally signed.  Do not combine multiple system access requests on the same DD Form 2875. 4.3.1.1.  CSSs/ISSOs,  in  coordination  with  the  organizational  security  manager,  verify user background investigation requirements IAW DoD 5200.2-R. 4.3.1.2.  The ISSO/ISSM (referred to as the “Information Assurance Officer” on the DD Form  2875)  retains  the  DD  Form  2875  IAW  instructions  outlined  on  the  form  for  non-AFNet ISs.  The CSS retains the DD Form 2875 according to the instructions on the form for AFNet ISs. 4.3.1.2.1.  Original  DD  Form  2875s  for  unprivileged  AFNet  accounts  may  be transferred  when  duty  assignments  change;  the  gaining  unit’s  CSS  may  use  local methods  to  update  duty  information  in  the  “IAO  Express”  tool  and  shared  drive access  requirements.    The  losing  unit’s  CSS  ensures  termination  of  shared  drive access  prior  to  users  out-processing.    Changes  to  privileged  account  access requirements require a new DD Form 2875. 4.3.1.2.2.  Re-accomplish  DD  Form  2875s  for  AFNet-SIPRNet  (AFNet-S)  accounts when access requirements change. 4.3.2.  In  accordance  with  AFMAN  17-1201,  users  of  all  authorized  IS  devices  (to  include Mobile  Computing  Devices)  sign  the  standardized  AF  Form  4394,  Air  Force  User Agreement Statement-Notice and Consent Provision, prior to initial IS access.  For wireless devices, users complete the standardized AF Form 4433, US Air Force Unclassified Wireless Mobile Device User Agreement.  Maintain copies of signed AF Forms 4433 within the CSS. 4.3.3.  Access  to  classified  ISs  also  requires  a  Standard  Form  (SF)  312,  Nondisclosure Agreement, IAW AFI 16-1404, Air Force Information Security Program.   4.4.  Token  Access.  IAW  DoDI  8520.02  and  DoDI  8520.03,  users  authenticating  to  DoD networks  require  the  use  of  a  hardware  token.    Follow  guidance  in  Chapter  8  to  obtain  a hardware  token  prior  to  being  granted  access  to  AFNet  and  AFNet-S  Directory  Services Domains and authenticating to NIPRNet or SIPRNet PK-Enabled websites. 18 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 4.5.  Loss  of  Access.  Access  to  an  AF  IS  is  a  privilege  and  continued  access  is  contingent  on personnel actions, changes in need to know, or operational necessity; see AFMAN 17-1201.  The ISO has the authority to re-instate users who have lost access. 4.5.1.  Specific  procedural  information  for  account  disabling  is  located  in  MPTO  00-33B-5004. 4.5.2.  Failure  to  complete  annual  CyberAwareness  Challenge  training  results  in  immediate suspension of access to unclassified and classified ISs. 4.5.3.  Actions that threaten or damage AF ISs may result in immediate suspension of access to  unclassified  and  classified  ISs  IAW  CJCSI  6510.01  and  DoD  5200.2-R.    Deliberate inappropriate use of user accounts or systems may result in administrative disciplinary action IAW AFMAN 17-1201. 4.5.3.1.  If  an  individual’s  clearance  is  suspended,  denied,  or  revoked,  immediately suspend access to classified ISs.  Commanders should review circumstances surrounding the  suspension,  denial,  or  revocation  to  determine  if  continued  access  to  unclassified systems is warranted and if revocation  of the hardware token is required.  Commanders may provide recommendations regarding user access to the ISO. 4.5.3.2.  If  an  individual  violates  the  IS  terms  of  use,  commanders  should  consider suspending  access  pending  re-accomplishment  of  CyberAwareness  Challenge  training.  Additional  restrictions  on  reinstatements  for  classified  ISs  are  determined  locally  and should follow the guidelines of DoD 5200.2-R. 07-015,  Public  Key 4.6.  Account Management.  AF direction is to use PKI-based identification and authentication IAW  DoDI  8520.02,  DoDI  8520.03  and  the  USCYBERCOM  Communications  Tasking  Order 2 (CTO) (https://www.cybercom.mil/J3/orders/Pages/CTOs.aspx).    Manage  all  user  accounts  using applicable  system  configuration  guidance;  follow  TOs  published  by  AFSPC  (e.g.,  MPTO  00-33B-5004, MPTO 00-33A-1202 [for AFNet accounts], and the applicable DISA STIGs [enclave, application security, operating system, database, etc.]). Implementation,  Phase Infrastructure (PKI) 4.6.1.  ISSM/ISSOs implement automated IS controls to check and disable IS user accounts that have been dormant more than 30 days IAW CJCSI 6510.01. 4.6.1.1.  AF  CIO  Exception:  Disable  National  Guard  and  Reserve  member  IS  user accounts only after 90 days of inactivity. 4.6.1.2.  Document  system  specific  IS  user  account  disabling  requirements  after  periods of inactivity in the IS security authorization package. 4.6.1.3.  ISSMs  provide  a  monthly  list  of  disabled  SIPRNet  accounts  to  the  base  Local Registration  Authority  (LRA)  for  SIPRNet  hardware  token  recovery  actions;  see Chapter 8. 4.6.2.  Delete unnecessary  (to include service accounts) and/or default  accounts and change all  factory  default  or  user-generated  passwords  included  in  a  newly  acquired  system (software  or  hardware)  IAW  the  configuration  information  in  the  IS  security  authorization package before allowing any user access to the system. 4.6.2.1.  Rename default accounts that cannot be deleted, IAW applicable DISA STIGs. AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 19 4.6.2.2.  Do not execute root-level access in IS applications. 4.6.2.3.  Disable/deactivate  user  accounts  (do  not  delete/deprovision)  when  users  are unable  to  remotely  access  their  accounts  due  to  an  extended  absence  or  when  a  user  is suspended  from  work,  IS  access  is  revoked  for  any  reason,  or  the  security  clearance  is suspended as specified in paragraph 4.5.3. 20 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 5 END POINT SECURITY 5.1.  Introduction.  End point security provides the basis for overall protection of AF-controlled IT  assets.    Follow  CJCSI  6510.01  on  the  use  of  DoD-provided,  enterprise-wide  automated tools/solutions (e.g.,  Host  Based Security System  [HBSS]) to  ensure interoperability  with  DoD and  AF  provided  enterprise-wide  solutions  for  remediation  of  vulnerabilities  for  endpoint devices. 5.2.  General  Protection.  All authorized users should protect networked and/or standalone ISs against  tampering,  theft,  and  loss.    Protect  ISs  from  insider  and  outsider  threats  by  controlling physical  access  to  the  facilities  and  data  by  implementing  procedures  identified  in  Joint,  DoD, AF publications, and organizationally created procedures.  See AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, for physical  access  security  guidance.  End point  security procedures are  located in  MPTO 00-33B-5006. 5.2.1.  Identify  and  authenticate  users  before  gaining  access  to  any  government  IS  IAW guidance in Chapter 4. 5.2.2.  ISSM/ISSO  provide  protection  from  threats  by  ensuring  proper  configuration  of technical security mechanisms and establishing physical controls for the removal and secure storage of information from unattended ISs (e.g., Common Access Card [CAC] removal lock feature, keyboard locks, secure screen savers, add-on security software).  This is done IAW the DISA Operating Systems STIGs and the system security plan (SSP) (found in the system authorization package in the Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service [eMASS]).  See NIST SP 800-53, Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, for more information about SSPs. 5.2.3.  Treat  devices  released  to  or  potentially  accessed  by  unauthorized  personnel  (outside DoD control) as an untrusted device until IS security policy requirements are re-established and validated IAW the DISA Removable Media Storage and External Connections STIG. 5.2.4.  Protect devices at the applicable security classification of the information stored in the device IAW CJCSI 6510.01 and this publication. 5.2.5.  Protect display devices to prevent inadvertent viewing of classified and controlled or sensitive  information  by  unauthorized  users  (e.g.,  away  from  windows,  doorways,  public areas); for more information see the DISA Traditional Security Checklist. 5.2.6.  Control viewing of US-Only ISs and equipment by FNs/LNs IAW CJCSI 6510.01; see the DISA Traditional Security Checklist. 5.2.7.  Ensure  transmission  of  sensitive  information  is  encrypted  using  NIST-certified cryptography at a minimum IAW CJCSI 6510.01. 5.2.8.  Ensure  the  transmission  of  classified  information  is  encrypted  using  NSA-approved cryptography IAW AFMAN 17-1302, Communications Security (COMSEC) Operations, and CJCSI 6510.01. AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 21 5.2.9.  In  areas  where  classified  information  is  processed,  ensure  ISs  meet  TEMPEST requirements IAW Air Force Systems Security Instruction (AFSSI) 7700, Emission Security (to become AFMAN 17-1305). 5.2.10.  Appropriately  mark  and  label  IT  devices  IAW  the  highest  level  of  classification processed  or  displayed  on  the  device  IAW  DoDM  5200.01,  Volume  2  DoD  Information Security  Program:  Marking  of  Classified  Information,  and  DoD  5220.22-M,  National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), if appropriate. 5.2.10.1.  Display/peripheral devices (e.g., monitors, projectors, televisions) are required to  be  either  physically  marked  or  technically  configured  to  display  the  classification banner. 5.2.10.1.1.

Equipment  can  only  be  delivered  to  a Federal  government  facility  and  installed  by  the  local  communications  support activity.    The  CAP  is  not  responsible  for  the  installation  of  AT.    The  enclave  or system  ISSM  may  submit  any  non-IA/IA-enabled  software  to  Air  Force  Network Integration  Center  (AFNIC)/NTS  for  certification.    Once  certified  (or  if  there  is  no software  to  certify),  the  ISSM  conducts  a  risk  assessment  to  determine  the  overall impact  to  the  enclave/system  security  posture  and  adds  it  to  the  IS/enclave  security authorization package. 5.11.3.2.  In  accordance  with  Public  Law  109-364,  Title  V,  Section  561,  Military Personnel  Policy,  the  AT  is  authorized  by  law  to  become  the  property  of  the  wounded service member at his or her separation from active service.  Therefore, the AT can and should remain with the service members as they transition to other locations or leave the military.  While the service member remains on active duty, review/assess any software upgrades on a case-by-case basis. 5.11.3.3.  When CAP purchases AT for a DoD civilian employee, the equipment becomes the  property  of  the  employee's  organization.    The  individual  organizations  have  the freedom to decide if equipment should go with the employee if they change federal jobs or stay with the agency.  CAP strongly encourages organizations to transfer the AT with AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 29 the  federal  employee  to  another  federal  job,  reducing  the  time  waiting  for  replacement equipment for the employee, ensuring reuse of the technology, and saving federal funds. 5.11.4.

Remanence  is  the  residual  information  remaining  on  storage  media.  REMSEC  actions  are  taken  to  protect  the  confidentiality  of  information  on  ISs  (to  include infrastructure devices such as routers and switches).  See the  IS security  authorization package for  system  specific  incident  response  and  REMSEC  procedures.    Exercise  risk  management procedures  IAW  DoDI  8500.01,  CJCSI  6510.01,  and  NIST  SP  800-88,  Guidelines  for  Media Sanitization. AF policy is to safeguard classified and sensitive information, no matter what the media.  Safeguarding classified and sensitive information in computer memory and media is particularly important during routine maintenance, product end of life, and reuse.  ISOs, privileged users, ISSMs, ISSOs, WCOs, operations personnel, and other responsible people should know the risk factors before sanitizing ISs media and releasing them from the controlled environment.  To protect against compromise allow only authorized and properly cleared persons with a need to know access to media containing classified and sensitive information.   6.1.1.  Risk  Assessment.    Balance  risk  management  decisions  on  information  sensitivity, threats and vulnerabilities, and the effectiveness and potential impact of the decided action. 6.1.1.1.  When  assessing  the  risk  of  releasing  ISs  media  from  DoD  control,  the  ISSO should  develop  procedures  that  identify  the  residual  risk  and  risk  tolerance  (the acceptable  level  of  risk  as  determined  by  the  ISO).    Follow  the  guidance  in  MPTO  00-33B-5008, Appendix C, and NIST SP 800-30, Revision 1, Guide for Risk Assessments. 6.1.1.2.  The ISSO, assisted by the WCO, assesses the risks in consultation with the Wing IP Office before deciding whether to sanitize for reuse or disposal. 6.1.1.3.  The  ISO  considers  the  full  range  of  vulnerabilities  and  security  implications  to include  the  actual  loss  if  an  unauthorized  entity  extracts  the  residual  information,  the threat  directed  against  this  information,  the  threat  of  recovery,  and  the  potential  for damage.  See MPTO 00-33B-5008 for risk management guidance. 6.1.2.  Risk Management.  Utilizing REMSEC within an organization is a risk management process  that  involves  the  information  owner,  ISO,  ISSM,  ISSO,  and  security  manager  to make  a  determination  of  potential  impact  prior  to  sanitizing  media  or  devices  for  reuse  or disposal.  The decision is based on a complete risk analysis that involves the identification of organizational  mission,  mission  impacts,  threats,  and  possible  compromise  to  the  IS  or information.    A  thorough  cost  benefit  analysis  coupled  with  mission  priorities  provides  the framework for this decision. 6.1.2.1.  Once  the  risk  analysis  has  been  completed,  document  the  mitigations  and  any residual  risk  in  the  IS  security  authorization  package  SSP  and  Plan  of  Actions  and Milestones (POA&M). 6.1.2.2.  As  the  monetary  cost  of  media  decreases,  the  cost  of  sanitizing  media  may become  impractical  and  destruction  may  become  more  cost  effective.    Costs  to  be considered  in  the  sanitization  and  destruction  decision  include  purchase  price  of sanitization  software  and  degaussing/destruction  equipment,  periodic  recertification  of 34 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 equipment,  cost  of  outsourcing,  and  time  required  for  verification,  documentation,  and tracking of sanitized media. 6.2.  Sanitization.  REMSEC  actions  to  sanitize  medium  (smartphone,  Flash,  random  access memory  [RAM]  and  read  only  memory  [ROM],  optical  disks,  solid  state  drives  [SSDs], magnetic disks, hard disk drives [HDD], etc.) is dependent upon classification of data contained within the device. 6.2.1.  Sanitization of unclassified devices follows NIST SP 800-88.  The term “sanitization” is defined in SP 800-88 as a process to render access to target data on the media infeasible for a  given  level  of  effort.    Clear,  purge,  and  destroy  are  actions  that  can  be  taken  to  sanitize media. 6.2.1.1.  Clear – A method of sanitization that applies logical techniques to sanitize data in  all  user-addressable  storage  locations  for  protection  against  simple  non-invasive  data recovery techniques; typically applied through the standard Read and Write commands to the storage device, such as by rewriting with a new value or using a menu option to reset the device to the factory state (where rewriting is not supported). 6.2.1.2.  Purge – A method of sanitization that applies physical or logical techniques that render target data recovery infeasible using state of the art laboratory techniques. 6.2.1.3.  Destroy – Renders target data recovery infeasible using state of the art laboratory techniques and results in the subsequent inability to use the media for storage of data. chopping/pulverizing/wet 6.2.2.  Sanitization  of  classified  devices  follows  the  NSA/Central  Security  Service  (CSS) Policy  Manual  9-12,  NSA/CSS  Storage  Device  Sanitization  Manual,  and  involves  the destruction  of  the  media  and/or  data  via  degaussing,  incineration,  disintegration,  shredding, embossing/knurling, strip shredding/cutting,  or  power  removal  (dynamic  random-access  memory  [DRAM],  static random-access  memory  [SRAM],  volatile  Field  Programmable  Gate  Array  [FPGA]).    Only products  listed  on  the  NSA  Evaluated  Products  List  (EPL)  or  received  approval  from  NSA may be used to destroy classified information (to include media and devices) per NSA/CSS Policy Manual 9-12.  Contact the NSA/CSS System and Network Analysis Center (SNAC) at (410)  854-6358  or  via  email  at  SNAC@radium.ncsc.mil,  to  obtain  technical  guidance concerning  appropriate  methods,  equipment,  and  standards  for  destroying  classified electronic  media,  IT  equipment,  electronic  components,  and  other  similar  or  associated materials. pulping (paper), grinding, 6.2.2.1.  Degauss (HDD/Diskettes) – Process for reducing the magnetization of a storage device  to  zero  by  applying  a  reverse  (coercive)  magnetizing  force,  rendering  any previously  stored  data  unreadable  and  unintelligible,  and  ensuring  that  it  cannot  be recovered  by  any  technology  known  to  exist.    Classified  IT  storage  media  cannot  be declassified by overwriting per DoDM 5200.01, Volume 3. 6.2.2.2.  Embossing/Knurling  (CDs/DVDs)  –  One  or  two  rotating  knurled  shafts  press down  on  the  surface,  elongating  the  focal  point  and  making  all  information  unreadable and inaccessible. AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 35 6.2.2.3.  Grinding (CDs) – Sanitize by destroying the surface of the optical storage media; DVDs  and  Blu-Ray  disks  have  information  layers  in  the  middle  of  the  disk,  making grinding ineffective for sanitization. 6.2.2.4.  Disintegration  (HDD/Diskettes/CDs/DVDs/SSDs)  –  Reduces  the  storage  media into small fragments of a specific size, depending upon the type, using a knife mill. 6.2.2.5.  Incinerate  (HDD/Diskettes/CD/DVD/BluRay  Disks/SSD)  –  Destruction  using high heat/temperatures to reduce the media into ash. 6.2.2.6.  Shredding (Diskettes/CD/DVD) – Physical shredding of media into small strips using two interlocking patterned drums that rotate in opposing directions. 6.2.2.7.  Power Removal (DRAM/SRAM/volatile FPGA)  – Clearing of volatile memory by removing power source for a specific duration. 6.2.2.8.  Strip  Shredding  or  Cutting  (smart  cards  only)  –  Destruction  of  smart  cards  by cutting or shredding in small pieces. 6.2.3.  When  sanitization  cannot  be  accomplished  (e.g.,  inoperable  disk),  destroy  the  media IAW DoDM 5200.01, Volume 3. 6.2.4.  Before  media  can  be  reused  in  a  classified  environment  or  released  from organizational control, complete a separate administrative procedure for declassification.  To determine  the  classification  of  the  data,  consult  the  applicable  system  classification  guide.  The  Defense  Technical  Information  Center  (DTIC)  maintains  a  repository  and  index  of security  classification  guides  IAW  DoDM  5200.01,  Volume  1,  DoD  Information  Security Program:    Overview,  Classification,  and  Declassification,  or  contact  the  system/enclave ISSM for a copy. 6.3.  Media  Reuse.  Sanitize  media  to  ensure  that  no  data  or  information  remains  on  operable media that are to be reused within the DoD. 6.3.1.  Clear  unclassified  media  before  reuse;  purge  media  containing  sensitive  data  (e.g., PII) prior to reuse.  Reference NIST SP 800-88. 6.3.2.  Clear  classified  media  before  reuse  and  reuse  only  in  a  classified  environment  IAW CJCSI 6510.01. 6.4.  Disposal.  Disposal is the process of reutilizing, transferring, donating, selling, destroying, or other final removal of media from service.  Disposal of government hardware and software is governed by DoDM 4160.21, Volume 4,  Defense Materiel Disposition Manual: Instructions for Hazardous  Property  and  Other  Special  Processing  Materiel,  and  DoDM  4160.21,  Volume  2, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual: Property Disposal and Reclamation. 6.4.1.  Purge  or  destroy  all  unclassified  IS  storage  media  before  leaving  the  control  of  the DoD, IAW NIST SP 800-88. 6.4.1.1.  Dispose  of  unclassified  electronic  media  IAW  NIST  SP  800-88.    Dispose  of unclassified  computing  systems  and  hard  drives  IAW  DoDM  5200.01,  Volume  3, Enclosure  7.    When  no  longer  needed,  unclassified  computer  systems  and  hard  drives may  be  disposed  of  outside  the  DoD.    In  some  circumstances,  the  equipment  may  be provided to non-government entities for reutilization. 36 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 6.4.1.2.  The  Defense  Logistics  Agency  Disposition  Services  (DLADS)  disposes  of excess  property  received  from  the  military  services.

For  installations without  the  means  to  sanitize  or  verify  sanitization,  NSA  does  accept  and  destroy  some classified  media.    Follow  the  guidance  on  the  NSA  Classified  Materiel  Conversion  (CMC) for  packaging,  documenting,  and  shipping  devices  at  https://www.nsa.gov/cmc/.    Direct questions  to  the  CMC  Customer  Service  Office  at  301-688-6672  or  via  email  at cmc@nsa.gov. 6.5.  Mixed  Media  Devices.  Determine  the  sanitization  requirements  of  mixed  media  devices, following  MPTO  00-33B-5008,  NSA/CSS  Policy  Manual  9-12,  and  NIST  SP  800-88.  Sanitization  is  complete  by  appropriately  sanitizing  all  the  media  contained  within  the  device. Hardware  such  as  routers,  switches,  MFDs,  etc.,  may  contain  multiple  types  of  media  and  the sanitization  methods  are  based  on  the  type  of  media  and  the  classification  of  the  operational environment.  Most network architecture devices have solid-state storage devices such as RAM, ROM,  FPGA,  smart  cards,  and  Flash  Memory.    DRAM,  SRAM,  Ferroelectric  RAM  (FRAM), Magnetic RAM (MRAM), Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM), Ultra-Violet EPROM  (UVEPROM),  and  Electrically  EPROM  (EEPROM)  have  specific  sanitization requirements. AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 37 Chapter 7 COMPUSEC ASSESSMENTS 7.1.  Purpose  .    The  COMPUSEC  Assessment  is  designed  to  provide  Cybersecurity  personnel assistance with implementing and maintaining a cybersecurity program. 7.2.  Objective  .  The COMPUSEC Assessment is a “find and fix” program review, essentially functioning as a staff assistance visit and therefore, the COMPUSEC Assessment is not intended to  replace,  but  rather  augment,  the  Air  Force  Inspection  System  (AFIS)  and  strengthen  the  AF cybersecurity program IAW AFI 17-130 and AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System. 7.2.1.  In  instances  where  local  inspection  authorities  (e.g.,  Wing  Inspection  Teams)  are already  performing  inspection  activities  in  partnership  with  the  WCO,  conduct  a  separate annual  COMPUSEC  assessment  at  the  discretion  of  the  WCO  and  organizational commander. 7.2.2.  WCO  assessments  may  be  combined  with  MAJCOM  IG  inspections  that  assess COMPUSEC criteria. 7.2.3.  Results  of  these  inspections  satisfy  annual  COMPUSEC  assessment  reporting requirements in paragraph 7.4. 7.3.  Assessment  Process  .    WCO  will  perform  annual  assessments  of  all  units  utilizing  IT under  the  control  of  the  base  communications  unit,  including  IT  of  tenant  units  (i.e.  FOAs, DRUs, and other service units) unless formal agreements exist.  (T-1).  For Joint bases, the AF is responsible  for  all  AF-owned  IT  and  infrastructure.    The  annual  period  is  defined  as  the  12-month timeframe since either the last WCO Assessment or MAJCOM IG Inspection. interview  and  site  visit  with 7.3.1.  Assessments  consist  of  an the  applicable ISSO/ISSM/CSS.    During  the  interview,  the  WCO  reviews  all  responses  annotated  on  the AFMAN  17-1301  COMPUSEC  MICT  SAC  (https://mict.us.af.mil/)  provided  by  the ISSO/ISSM/CSS  during  the  last  self-assessment.    As  part  of  the  site  visit,  the  WCO  may assess organizational  compliance with  any COMPUSEC criteria as outlined in  this manual.  Sample assessment items may be found on the IACE.  Additional areas for review are at the discretion of the WCO. 7.3.1.1.  For  geographically  separated  units  (GSUs),  remote  interviews  (i.e.,  over  the phone) are acceptable in lieu of a site visit when travel costs are a concern. 7.3.1.2.  In-brief,  out-brief,  and  other  formalization  of  assessment  processes  are  at  the discretion of the WCO and the assessed unit. 7.3.2.  Assessments are not graded, but should instead provide organizational commanders an accurate COMPUSEC posture indication by itemizing the deficient COMPUSEC items and summarizing additional observations, recommendations, and best practices. 7.4.  Reports.  COMPUSEC  Assessment  Reports  provide  a  narrative  description  of  the deficiencies  and  significant  trends  identified  during  the  annual  COMPUSEC  Assessment.  Reports consist of detailed unit reports, follow-up reports, and annual executive summaries. 38 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 7.4.1.  Detailed  unit  reports  include  a  narrative  of  deficient  COMPUSEC  items,  impacts  if deficiencies  are  not  corrected,  additional  areas  assessed,  assistance  provided, recommendations,  and best  practices.

A  vital  element  of  the  DoD  defense-in-depth  strategy  is  the  use  of  a common,  integrated  DoD  PKI  to  enable  network  security  services  throughout  the  enterprise.  PKI  includes  a  combination  of  hardware,  software,  policies,  and  procedures,  as  well  as,  the ability  to  authenticate,  protect,  digitally  sign,  and  when  necessary,  encrypt  electronic  mail (email) and documents.  PKI verifies identities using digital signatures and certificates. Implementation of PKI through PK enabling is required on all IT IAW DoDI 8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03.   8.2.  PKI Guidance  .  The DoD and the CNSS PKIs have various tokens that are used with the DoD  and  AF.    PKI  hardware  tokens  provide  two-factor  authentication  IAW  DoDI  8520.02,  to DoD  and  AF  ISs  and  access  to  DoD  and  AF  Directory  Services  domains  on  NIPRNet  and SIPRNet.    The  DoD  and  the  CNSS  PKIs  use  asymmetric  cryptography  to  identify  and authenticate users to systems and networks for the NIPRNet and SIPRNet. 8.2.1.  DoDI  8500.01  requires  the  use  of  certificates  issued  by  DoD-approved  identity credentials to authenticate to DoD ISs. 8.2.2.  The  CAC  is  the  primary  hardware  token  for  identifying  individuals  for  access  to NIPRNet  assets  and  physical  access  to  DoD  facilities  according  DoDI  8520.02,  DoDM 1000.13, Volume 1, DoD Identification (ID) Cards:  ID Card Life-Cycle, and AFI 31-101. 8.2.2.1.  There  are  special  instances  where  the  CAC  cannot  be  used.    For  these  unique situations, the DoD CIO has approved the use of the Alternate Logon Token (ALT). 8.2.2.2.  The  NIPRNet  Directory  Services  domain  and  SIPRNet  legacy  Directory Services  domains  are  defined  in  the  DISA  STIGs  as  General  Business  Enclave  LANs.  All accounts and computers in Directory Services are required to use PKI. 8.2.2.2.1.  Annotate smart card removal and screensaver exemptions that are allowed for very limited use cases in the enclave/system security authorization documentation IAW the applicable DISA Operating System STIG. 8.2.2.2.2.  Submit PKI, (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil)  when  a  normal  Directory  Services-joined  computer cannot fulfill the organizations requirements. CYSS/CYZ AFSPC Service Requests to 8.2.3.  Identity  Credential  Determination.    DoDI  8520.03  requires  that  the  ISO    determines the  “Credential  Strength”  used  to  authenticate  to  the  DoD  IS  by  assessing  the  “Sensitivity Level” of the information contained in the DoD IS. 8.3.  NIPRNet PKI.  The most commonly used unclassified PKI hardware token or smart card is the  CAC.    The  ALT  can  be  issued  in  circumstances  where  the  CAC  cannot  be  issued  to  an individual.    The  Volunteer  Logical  Access  Credential  (VoLAC)  can  be  issued  to  eligible volunteers.    If  there  are  validated  circumstances  where  a  NIPRNet  token  cannot  be  used,  a NIPRNet Smart Card Logon (SCL) waiver allowing the use of username and password may be authorized.  Contact AFSPC CYSS/CYZ PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil) for guidance. 40 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 8.3.1.  AFI 36-3026 IP, Volume 1, Identification (ID) Cards for Members of the Uniformed Services,  Their  Eligible  Family  Members,  and  Other  Eligible  Personnel,  identifies  the individuals that are eligible for CACs.  Individuals should be issued a separate CAC for each persona  (e.g.,  Active  Duty  Service  Member,  Reserve  or  Guard  Member,  Government Civilian,  Contractor)  IAW  DoDM  1000.13,  Volume  1.    This  role  or  persona  is  commonly referred to as a Personnel Category Code (PCC). 8.3.1.1.  For  uniformed  services  personnel  and  DoD  civilians,  all  submissions  to  DoD Enrollment  Eligibility  Reporting  System  (DEERS)  can  be  made  electronically  via  an authorized data source feed (e.g., Civilian Personnel Management Service). 8.3.1.2.  The  Defense  Manpower  Data  Center  (DMDC),  as  the  administrator  of  DEERS and  the  Real-Time  Automated  Personnel  Identification  System  (RAPIDS),  requires  the use of the Trusted Associate Sponsorship System (TASS) for requesting CACs for “DoD PKI Certificate Eligible Users,” IAW DoDM 1000.13. 8.3.1.2.1.  DoD PKI Certificate Eligible Users are authorized DoD volunteers, State, local, or tribal government employees, or interns as defined DoDI 8520.02.  To begin the process for VoLAC issuance, to include completion of DD Form 2793, Volunteer Agreement for  Appropriated  Fund  Activities  and  Non-Appropriated  Fund Instrumentalities, contact supporting TASS Trusted Agent (TA).  The TA establishes sponsorship  of  the  applicant,  verifies  the  access  requirements,  and  initiates  the application process in TASS. 8.3.1.2.1.1.  The  TASS  application  replaced  the  Contractor  Verification  System (CVS) and was designed to replace the paper application process using DD Form 1172-2, Application for Department of  Defense  (DoD) CAC Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) Enrollment. 8.3.1.2.1.2.  TASS  allows  “DoD  PKI  Certificate  Eligible  Users”  requiring  DoD Network  access,  DoD  and  Uniformed  Service  Contractors,  Foreign  Affiliates, Non-DoD  Civil  Service  Employees,  Non-Federal  Agency  Civilian  Associates, Non-US Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) Employees, outside the continental U.S. (OCONUS) Hires, Other Federal Agency Contractors to apply for a CAC or other government credential  electronically through the Internet.  Government sponsors of DoD contractor personnel should contact their supporting TASS TA to request an application for an eligible contractor to receive government credentials. 8.3.1.2.1.3.  Follow  the  guidance  provided  in  DoDM  1000.13  and  the  TASS  TA user manual. 8.3.1.2.2.  Unfunded  contract  options  (annotated  in  the  contract  as  the  period  of performance [PoP]) are considered in the determination of the length of contract.  For example,  a  contractor  hired  under  DoD  contract  with  a  base  year  plus  two  option years  should  be  issued  a  CAC  with  a  3-year  expiration.    The  expiration  date  of  the PKI certificates on the CAC should match the expiration date on the card.  If contract option  years are not  exercised, the COR notifies the TASS TA to  revoke contractor access.   AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 41 8.3.1.3.  Dual-role  personnel  have  more  than  one  role/persona  (e.g.,  Civilian  and Reservist, Contractor and Air National Guard); the individual is required to have and use the  appropriate  CAC  for  each  role.    At  issuance,  the  CAC  should  not  have  the individual’s PCC appended to his or her Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier (EDI-PI). Portal (https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/self_service/rapids/unauthenticated?execution=e2s1).  Set  the  CAC/Directory  Services  account  that  the  individual  uses  the  most  with  EDI-PI@MIL,  and set  the CAC/Directory Services account  that is  used the least  with  EDI-PI.PCC@MIL.  Each time a new CAC is issued, append the PCC. the  RAPIDS   Append Service PCCs at Self 8.3.1.4.  Authorized  DoD  volunteers,  State,  local,  or  tribal  government  employees,  or interns  are  “DoD  PKI  Certificate  Eligible  Users”  IAW  DoDI  8520.02.    Contact supporting TASS TA to begin the process for VoLAC issuance, to include completion of DD Form 2793.  The TA enters user information into TASS. 8.3.1.5.  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC)  manages  the  issuance  of  CACs  through DEERS/RAPIDS.  On AF installations, the AF Military Personnel Section (MPS) issues the CAC.  On non-AF locations, any RAPIDS can issue a CAC to any authorized Service Member, Government Civilian, or DoD Contractor.  DoD Contractors contact their unit’s TASS  TA  prior  to  making  an  appointment  with  their  supporting  MPS  to  have  their information entered or updated in DEERS. 8.3.1.6.  Turn in expired, unneeded, or found CACs or VoLACs to the nearest RAPIDS facility  by  the  individual,  Contracting  Officer’s  Representative  (COR)  for  DoD contractors, or TASS TA. 8.3.2.  The ALT is another form of a DoD authorized PKI hardware token or smart card that can be issued to individuals for logical access to NIPRNet.  Currently, there is not an ALT-like capability on SIPRNet. 8.3.2.1.  Individuals who are ineligible for receiving a CAC (e.g., Italian Nationals) or the support  staff  serving  a  General  Officer  (GO)  or  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)  (e.g., PKI Tier-1) can be issued an ALT with DoD PKI certificates.  See T.O. 31S5-4-7282-1, Alternate  Logon  Token  (ALT)  Issuance  Standard  Operating  Procedures,  for  specific issuance criteria or eligibility. 8.3.2.2.  The  user/requestor  should  contact  their  base  ALT  TA,  usually  assigned  to  the supporting base communications unit or Communications Focal Point (CFP), to begin the ALT see https://afpki.lackland.af.mil/html/b-alttokencontacts.cfm. each  base’s  ALT  TAs, issuance  process. list  of   For a 8.3.2.3.  Turn in expired, unneeded, or found ALTs to the nearest AF base’s ALT TA. 8.3.3.  Most  commercially  available  token  readers  (separate  device  or  integrated  into  a keyboard)  can be used on the NIPRNet; there is  no approved or banned  product  list.   Only use  the  latest  approved  version  of  middleware  on  NIPRNet.    Remove  all  other  middleware products from the IS. 8.3.4.  Maintain positive control over hardware token at all times IAW AFI 36-3026. 8.3.4.1.  Do not leave any unclassified PKI hardware token in an unattended computer. 42 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 8.3.4.2.  The  person  who  is  issued  a  hardware  token  maintains  positive  control  of  the token  at  all  times  and  the  embedded  certificates  IAW  the  applicable  CNSS  guidance, DoD  Registration  Practice  Statement  (RPS),  or  United  States  Department  of  Defense X.509 Certificate Policy. 8.3.4.3.  Introduction of SIPRNet hardware tokens on NIPRNet ISs are not authorized.  If a SIPRNet  hardware token has been used on an unclassified  IS, see paragraph 8.4.6 for guidance. 8.3.5.  Implement SHA-256 algorithm on all DoD IT infrastructure (hardware and software) on both NIPRNet and SIPRNet IAW the DoD Secure Hash Algorithm-256 Transition Plan. 8.3.5.1.  All  DoD  Components  are  required  to  support  DoD-approved  SHA-256  PKI credentials for digitally signing and encrypting emails, logging onto DoD networks, and authenticating to systems no later than September 30, 2017. 8.3.5.2.  All  NIPRNet  Systems  are  required  to  be  SHA-256  compliant  according  to SAF/CIO  A6   AFSPC  CYSS/CYZ  PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil).   To be  compliant, all systems,  websites, web capabilities, network devices, and software should be capable of utilizing the SHA-256 certificate or SHA-256 certificates when issuance on the CAC begins. a  POA&M to or submit 8.3.5.3.  Follow  FIPS  180-4,  FIPS  140-2,  and  the  validation  lists  available  through  the NIST CMVP and the CAVP sites (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/index.html). 8.4.  SIPRNet  PKI.  The  SIPRNet  hardware  token  is  the  primary  means  for  logical  access  to SIPRNet.    If  there  are  validated  circumstances  where  a  SIPRNet  token  cannot  be  used,  a SIPRNet  SCL  exemption  allowing  the  use  of  username  and  password  may  be  allowed  IAW MTO  2013-077-002C  (or  current  update  of  the  MTO).    Contact  AFSPC  CYSS/CYZ  PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil) for guidance. 8.4.1.  Ensure  all  SIPRNet  networks  utilize  the  National  Security  Systems  (NSS)  Root Certificate  Authority  (CA)  and  are  current  with  all  PKI  security  patches  and  configuration settings IAW the applicable Certificate Practice Statement (CPS). 8.4.2.  Individuals  who  have  a  SIPRNet  Directory  Services  account  are  required  to  use SIPRNET  hardware  tokens  IAW  USCYBERCOM  TASKORD  J3-12-0863,  Fragmentary Order (FRAGO) 2. 8.4.3.  The  LRA,  normally  residing  at  the  supporting  base  normally  within  the  base communications  unit  or  CFP,  issues  the  SIPRNet  hardware  token  or  smart  card.    The SIPRNet  hardware  token  provides  authorized  users  with  an  identity  certificate,  digital signature certificate, and an encryption certificate.  With appropriate network configuration, the SIPRNet hardware token or smart card provides user authentication and non-repudiation for network logon. 8.4.4.  The  SIPRNet  hardware  token  or  smart  card  is  a  high-value  unclassified  item.  Maintain  the  SIPRNet  hardware  token  IAW  CNSSI  No.  1300,  National  Security  Systems Public  Key  Infrastructure  X.509  Certificate  Policy  Under  CNSS  Policy  No.  25,  and  the National  Security  Systems  Public  Key  Infrastructure,  Department  of  Defense  Registration Practice Statement (RPS). AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 43 8.4.4.1.  A  SIPRNET  token  is  classified  SECRET  when  inserted  into  the  SIPRNET hardware  token  reader  and  the  personal  identification  number  (PIN)  is  entered.  It  is considered unclassified when removed from the SIPRNET token reader or if it is inserted into the token reader but the PIN is not entered. 8.4.4.2.  Do  not  leave  the  SIPRNet  hardware  token  unattended  in  computer  network resources. 8.4.4.3.  Maintain  the  SIPRNet  hardware  token  in  the  positive  control  of  the  authorized user, who is  represented by the embedded certificates  IAW the applicable CNSS policy or  RPS.    Turn-in  expired,  unneeded,  or  found  SIPRNet  hardware  tokens  to  the  nearest NSS  LRA  by  the  individual,  COR  for  DoD  Contractors,  or  TASS  TA.    Note:    Do  not return the found SIPRNet hardware token back to the individual.  See paragraph 8.16 for key compromise guidance. 8.4.4.3.1.  Positive  control  includes  maintaining  visual  contact  when  in  use,  and retention on the person or secured when not in use. SIPRNET tokens are considered secured  when  locked  or  stored  within  a  container  (e.g.,  desk)  inside  a  facility authorized for the protection of SECRET. Only the assigned user is authorized to use the SIPRNET token. 8.4.4.3.2.  Contact the supporting LRA to revoke SIPRNet hardware token certificates when there is suspected loss of positive control or unauthorized use of the token or a certificate. Return any token determined to be temporarily out of the positive control of the assigned user to the LRA.  When returned, zeroize the private keys and revoke the certificates.  If zeroizing and revocation is not possible or if there is evidence of tampering with the SIPRNet hardware token, the LRA returns the token to NSA for investigation and/or destruction. 8.4.4.3.3.  If  the  SIPRNet  hardware  token  is  lost  or  stolen  and  not  recovered, immediately  report  this  information  to  the  LRA  to  initiate  the  revocation  process IAW the applicable CPS.   Issuance of a new SIPRNet  hardware token is authorized after  a  dated  and  signed  memorandum  (wet  or  digital  signature  acceptable)  on organizational  letterhead  by  the  requesters  Commander  authorizing  the  issuance,  is provided to the LRA. 8.4.4.3.4.  AF  GO  and/or  SES  members  are  authorized  to  retain  their  SIPRNet hardware token during a permanent change of station (PCS).  All other AF SIPRNet users are required to turn–in their SIPRNet hardware token when undergoing a PCS or permanent change of assignment (PCA) (see paragraph 8.4.5.3.4.2). 8.4.4.3.4.1.  The  GO/SES  or  designated  representative  notifies  the  losing  base LRA,  either  in  person  or  through  a  digitally-signed  e-mail  stating  that  he/she  is taking the SIPRNet hardware token to the new location and site code needs to be changed/updated.  The losing base LRA changes the site code for the registration tied  to  the  SIPRNet  hardware  token  of  the  GO/SES  in  the  Token  Management System  (TMS).  The  losing  base  LRA  notifies  the  gaining  base  LRA  of  the transfer through a digitally signed e-mail.   44 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 8.4.4.3.4.2.  Any  user  may  retain  their  SIPRNet  hardware  token  during  PCA,  if the issuing LRA remains the same. 8.4.4.3.5.  Enclave or system ISSM/ISSO notifies the base LRA of expired accounts (see  paragraph  4.6.1.2);  the  base  LRA  contacts  users  and  recovers  the  SIPRNet hardware tokens from them. 8.4.4.3.6.  Base  communications  unit  will  update  their  portion  of  the  base  out-processing checklist to ensure that all individuals have contacted their unit’s CSS to terminate their SIPRNet account and have turned-in their SIPRNet hardware token to the base LRA prior to signing off the individual’s Base Out-processing Checklist.  (T-1).  Contractors contact their unit’s CSS to terminate their SIPRNet account and turn-in their SIPRNet hardware tokens to the base LRA at the end of the contract PoP. 8.4.5.  Prohibit  the  introduction  of  (operational)  SIPRNet  hardware  tokens  on  unclassified ISs  and  the  introduction  of  unclassified  tokens  (e.g.,  CAC,  ALT,  Personal  Identity Verification [PIV], VoLAC, and or Personal  Identity  Verification-Interoperable [PIV-I]) on classified ISs. 8.4.5.1.  SIPRNet  hardware  tokens  inserted  into  an  unclassified  IS  may  result  in  a security violation.  Report suspected incidents to the WCO and local security manager to determine if the incident is a security violation.  Follow the guidance in DoDM 5200.01, Volume  3.    Note:    This  does  not  apply  to  SIPRNet  hardware  token  testing  cards  on unclassified test beds. 8.4.5.2.  The SIPRNet “90meter©” middleware configuration detects the NIPRNet token, blocks PIN entry, and blocks any service applets that do not require PIN entry. 8.4.5.3.  An  unclassified  hardware  token  inserted  into  a  SIPRNet  IS  may  result  in  a security violation.  Report suspected incidents to the WCO and local security manager to determine if the incident is a security violation.  Follow the guidance in DoDM 5200.01, Volume 3. 8.4.6.  Connect  only authorized SIPRNet  hardware token readers (i.e. Omnikey 3121, SCM 3310) to SIPRNet ISs.  The connection of keyboards with built-in CAC readers and external USB CAC readers to classified ISs are not permitted. 8.4.6.1.  Permit  only  the  latest  version  of  “90meter©”  middleware  and  configure  it  to activate only SIPRNet hardware tokens initialized for use on the SIPRNet. 8.4.6.2.  In the AF, “ActivClient©” middleware is not authorized on SIPRNet. 8.4.7.  All  SIPRNet  Systems  are  required  to  be  SHA-256  compliant  according  to  SAF/CIO A6 or submit a POA&M to  AFSPC CYSS/CYZ PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil).  To be compliant, all systems,  websites, web capabilities, network devices, and software should be capable  of  utilizing  the  SHA-256  certificate  or  SHA-256  certificates  when  issuance  on  the SIPRNet  hardware  token  begins.    Follow  FIPS  180-4,  FIPS  140-2,  and  the  validation  lists available CMVP sites (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/index.html). through CAVP the NIST and the   AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 45 8.5.  User  or  Administrator  Password/PIN  Management.  Passwords  may  be  allowed  only when the AF PKI SPO has evaluated the AF Information System and has validated that the use of  PKI  smart  cards  or  other  approved  two  factor  authentication  is  not  technologically  feasible; contact AFSPC CYSS/CYZ PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil) for guidance.  Specific procedural information for password/PIN management is located in MPTO 00-33B-5004.  In addition to the AF-specific  password  guidance  contained  in  the  MPTO  00-33B-5004,  configure  IS  password authentication  IAW  the  applicable  DISA  Operating  System  STIGs.

Classify and protect passwords/PINs at the highest level of information processed on that system.  As a minimum, safeguard passwords as FOUO.  See DoDM 5200.01, Volume 1, for a detailed explanation of FOUO. 8.5.2.  Classified  passwords/PINs  that  are  necessary  for  mission  accomplishment  (i.e.,  pre-established  accounts  for  contingency  or  exercise)  may  be  sealed  in  a  properly  marked envelope  or  annotated  on  a  SF  700,  Security  Container  Information,  and  stored  in  a  GSA-approved container as specified in DoDM 5200.01, Volume 3. 8.5.3.  Protect all passwords/PINs during transmission using FIPS-approved encryption IAW CJCSI 6510.01. 8.5.4.  All  passwords  for  AF  ISs  are  required  to  comply  with  the  following  password management criteria. 8.5.4.1.  To  the  extent  capabilities  permit,  system  mechanisms  are  implemented  to enforce automatic expiration of passwords and to prevent password reuse, and processes are in place to validate that passwords are sufficiently strong to resist cracking and other attacks intended to  discover a user's password.   All  factory set,  default or standard-user IDs and passwords are removed or changed. 8.5.4.2.  Authenticators are protected commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of  the  information  accessed,  they  are  not  shared,  and  they  are  not  embedded  in  access scripts or stored on function keys. 8.5.4.3.  Passwords are encrypted both for storage and for transmission.  Store passwords in  an  authentication  system  that  minimizes  their  exposure  to  disclosure  or  unauthorized replacement.    Encryption  of  electronically  stored  passwords  and  password  files  is required. 8.5.4.4.  Service Account passwords have different requirements than user passwords; see paragraph 8.21. 8.5.4.5.  Case  sensitive,  at  least  15-character  mix  of  two  upper  case  letters,  two  lower case letters, two numbers, and two special characters.  For password changes, change at least four characters when a new password is created. 8.5.4.6.  The  ISO  ensures  the  establishment  of  procedures  for  manual  or  automatic password changes by users, administrators, and machine-to-machine interfaces; password changes occur at least every 60 days or more frequently as determined by the ISO, IAW CJCSI 6510.01. 46 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 8.5.5.  For  systems  that  are  not  joined  to  the  Directory  Services  domain  and  require shared/group  passwords,  the  system  ISSM  requests  approval  from  the  AO  IAW  CJCSI 6510.01.  Implement system and physical auditing procedures to support non-repudiation and accountability.    For  more  information  on  waiving  DoD  or  AF  PKI  requirements,  see paragraph 8.22. 8.5.5.1.  Unauthorized  sharing  of  passwords/PINs  is  a  security  incident  IAW  CJCSI 6510.01. 8.5.5.2.  Incorporate  electronic  or  paper  tracking  methods  to  account  for  user  activity when using AO-approved shared passwords IAW CJCSI 6510.01. 8.5.6.  In  the  event  of  a  compromised  password/PIN,  the  ISO  and  the  ISSM  ensures procedures  are  in  place  to  implement  immediate  password/PIN  change  activities.    A compromised  PKI  PIN  warrants  probable  compromise  of  the  associated  certificates.    See paragraph 8.16. 8.6.  PIN  Caching  Setting  .

The  Organizational  Mailbox Sponsor should follow the procedures for managing the Organizational Mailbox Encryption Certificate found on the AF PKI SPO website (https://afpki.lackland.af.mil/). 8.8.  Organizational  Accounts.  Organizational  Accounts  are  Active  Accounts  that  individuals use to  logon using DoD-approved PKI and  accesses the electronic mailbox associated with  the Organizational Account (e.g., AFSPC/CC, AFSPC/CCC, AFSPC/CCF).  Each individual should have  a  unique  identifier  that  the  system  can  authenticate  and  provide  an  audit  trail.    The Organizational  Accounts  are  unique  since  a  DoD  approved  hardware  token  is  used  to  logon  to the associated Directory Services account to access files or email. 8.8.1.  In  order  for  multiple  users  to  access  the  same  Organizational  Account,  each  person should possess a unique DoD approved hardware token (e.g., ALT).  More than one person cannot share a single DoD approved hardware token. 8.9.  Group  Accounts  Utilizing  PKI.  Group  accounts  (not  to  be  confused  with  organizational accounts)  are  special  case  accounts  where  more  than  one  person  may  access  the  same  account using a DoD-approved PKI credential IAW DoDI 8520.02. AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 47 8.9.1.  The approval authority for group accounts is one of the applicable AOs; see boundary specific letters https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/SAFCIOA6/A6S/afcks/AFAAP/Lists/DAA_Program/AO_Public.aspx. appointment AFIN 8.9.1.1.  For AFIN group accounts, the approval authority is the Enterprise AO.  To begin the PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil)  to  determine  if  the  appropriate  solution  is  the  use  of  a group  account.    AFSPC  CYSS/CYZ  PKI  identifies  the  appropriate  next  step  in  the approval process. CYSS/CYZ approval process, contact AFSPC 8.9.1.2.  For  non-AFIN  group  accounts,  the  approval  authority  is  the  applicable  AO  for the specific boundary. 8.9.2.  Authorized  users  request  individual  ALTs  to  access  the  group  account;  each  token contains an individual identification certificate.  See paragraph 8.3.2. 8.9.3.  The ALT Sponsor maintains an inventory of token serial numbers and assigned users at all times. 8.9.4.  Requests for group account ALTs should follow T.O. 31S5-4-7282-1. 8.10.  External  PKI.  To  begin  the  approval  process  for  External  PKI  as  authorized  by  DoDI 8520.02,  contact  AFSPC  CYSS/CYZ  PKI  (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil).    AFSPC  CYSS/CYZ PKI identifies the appropriate next step in the approval process. 8.11.  Enterprise Certificate Trust Governance.  Identity assurance must be applied to ensure strong identification and authentication, and to eliminate anonymity in DoD IS and PIT systems. DoD  will  public  key-enable  DoD  ISs  and  implement  a  DoD-wide  PKI  solution  that  will  be managed by the DoD PKI Program Management Office in accordance with DoDI 8520.02.  The AF  Certificate  Trust  baseline  provides  a  white/black  list  of  PKI  Certificate  Authorities  (CAs)  trust  anchors  (or  roots)  to  secure  AF  systems  from  trusting  unknown  and/or  untrusted  issuing CAs.    It  includes  a  minimum  number  of  roots  required  for  the  OS  to  operate  and  to  support specific  enterprise  applications.      The  AF  Certificate  Trust  Store  Governance  process  exists  to manage the baseline and provide a formal means to add and remove roots at the enterprise level. 8.11.1.  If an AF IS user attempts to go to a website where the root CA has expired and is no longer being updated, a “Certificate Error” warning is displayed in the web browser. 8.11.1.1.  For non-enterprise use  (individual  users), follow  the procedures posted on the IACE. 8.11.1.2.  For  Enterprise  use,  the  ISSM  submits  a  request,  on  behalf  of  all  users,  to AFSPC  CYSS/CYZ  PKI  (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil)  using  the  template  found  on  the IACE. 8.12.  Escrowed  Certificates.  The  CA  provides  automatic  escrow  of  the  email  encryption  key IAW  United  States  Department  of  Defense  X.509  Certificate  Policy.    Perform  recovery  of escrowed  encryption  keys  according  to  the  CA  associated  practice  statements.    Recovery  of Escrowed Certificates is required to read encrypted emails that were received by the user using the previous certificates. 48 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 8.12.1.  Changing  of  employment  roles  (i.e.  contractor-to-government  civilian,  military-to-contractor,  etc.)  may  affect  the  users’  need  to  know  and  requires  the  users  to  request manually the escrowed encryption certificate.  For additional guidance, see the AF PKI SPO website (https://afpki.lackland.af.mil/). 8.13.  Software Certificate Issuance and Control.  The AF follows the methods for approving PKI  certificates  as  prescribed  in  the  DoD  PKI  RA/LRA  CPS  and  DoD  RPS,  supported  by  the DoD X.509 Certificate Policy.   AF RAs have overall management  responsibility  for  certificate issuance with LRA/TA as base level points of contact.  The AF Enterprise AO is the approving authority for each use of software certificates.  To begin the approval process, the system/enclave ISSM should contact AFSPC CYSS/CYZ PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil). 8.13.1.  AF PKI RAs, LRAs, CA Managers, CA Operators, System Administrators, and CA Security  Managers  comply  with  the  detailed  policy  and  procedures  as  applicable;  see https://afpki.lackland.af.mil/. 8.13.2.  Upon  approval  from  the  AO,  the  ISSM  annotates  the  use  in  the  authorization package (security control CM-6). 8.13.3.  ISSMs ensure all devices are configured with an approved token reader or have AF Enterprise  AO-approval  to  use  software  certificates  IAW  the  DISA  Commercial  Mobile Device  (CMD)  Policy  STIG.    Identification,  digital  signature,  and  encryption  software certificates  are  required  for  CMDs  and  have  a  designated  sponsor  appointed  in  writing; contact  AFSPC  CYSS/CYZ  PKI  (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil).    The  AF  Registration Authority  (RA)  or  LRA,  as  appropriate,  maintains  a  file  of  requirement  validation documentation..  For organizational email mailboxes on CMDs, follow the appropriate DISA STIG. SPO  website (https://afpki.lackland.af.mil/). the  AF PKI For  additional guidance, see 8.13.3.1.  For organizations working to comply with the mandate to use CAC readers and requiring  the  use  of  software  certificates  on  enterprise  activated  CMDs,  submit  a POA&M and the token reader exceptions to the AF PKI for review and recommendation to the AF Enterprise AO. 8.13.3.2.  Once  approved  by  AF  Enterprise  AO,  use  PKI  software  certificates  for  the minimum time necessary to comply with the token reader requirement.  The ISSM adds the  approval  to  the  system/enclave  authorization  package;  approval  may  be  a memorandum, letter, or included in the SSP. 8.13.3.3.  Organizations  update  user  training  materials  and  annotate  certificate  usage  in block 12 of the AF Form 4433. 8.13.4.  DoD  PKI  certificates  and  associated  private  keys  are  stored  in  a  Public-Key Cryptography  Standards  (PKCS)  #12  file  on  a  removal  storage  medium.    Do  not  leave PKCS#12  files  in  on-line  file  systems  and  are  properly  installed  into  the  cryptographic module on an IS for use. 8.13.5.  Do  not  share  personal  software  certificate  passwords;  protect  the  media  containing private keys from unauthorized access at all times IAW paragraph 8.5. 8.13.6.  The  Network  Operations  Squadrons  (NOS)  verify  removal  of  software  certificate installation files (.p12 or .pfx) from hard drives and other online storage devices weekly. AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 49 8.13.6.1.  Removal  of  software  certificate  files  does  not  prevent  usage  of  software certificates  for  web  servers,  group,  or  role-based  functions.    The  process  only  requires removal  of  the  “.p12”  or  “.pfx”  transportable  file  object  that  contains  the  private  key corresponding  to  the  DoD  trusted  certificate  from  online  accessibility  after  installation.  NOTE:  Some applications create files with extensions of “.p12” or “.pfx” that are NOT certificate installation files.  Removal of non-certificate installation files from systems is not required. eligibility information 8.14.  LRA  Guidance.  LRAs perform some  aspects  of certificate issuance and management  at the  local  level.    Designated  LRAs  have  certificate  issuance  authority  for  the  entire  installation, including Tenant organizations and GSUs supported by the installation.  Training, appointment, and at https://afpki.lackland.af.mil.    AF  MAJCOMS/Bases/Sites  and  AF  supported  COCOMS  can establish and maintain AF  LRAs who  are designated  IAW procedures outlined in  the CPS and RPS, meeting needs of all base, site, and tenant  organizations.  Designated  LRAs will attend a DISA  approved  AF  LRA  training  course  after  the  AF  RA  Office  has  vetted  and  approved  the submission  package.    Detailed  procedures  for  submitting  LRA  packages  are  available  at https://afpki.lackland.af.mil/html/. the  AF  PKI  SPO  website is available on 8.15.  CMD  Hardware  Token  Readers.  ISSMs  ensure  all  devices  are  configured  with  an approved  token  readers  and/or  an  AO-approved  process  for  installation  of  PKI  software certificates  IAW  the  DISA  Mobile  Policy  SRG.    See  paragraph  8.5  for  password  requirements for  devices  not  capable  of  supporting  PKI  and  the  DISA  Mobility  STIGs/SRGs  for  guidance setting up token readers. 8.16.  Key  Compromise.  The  ISSO  immediately  notifies  the  supporting  TA,  LRA,  or  the  AF RA (afpki.registration@us.af.mil) directly by encrypted email if an AF PKI certificate holder (software certificate or token) suspects a compromise of the holder’s private key. 8.16.1.  Certificate  revocation  is  necessary  to  terminate  a  certificate’s  use  before  its  normal expiration date.  Examples of reasons for revocations include private key compromise (e.g., lost or stolen token), loss of trust in a user, changes in a user’s legal name, or departure from the DoD.  The AF RA revokes certificates suspected of key compromise within 24 hours or the next duty day (whichever is first) after notification. 8.16.1.1.  Revoke all other certificates (e.g., encryption and digital signature) on the token if there is a revocation of a user's ID certificate. 8.16.1.2.  Enter  the  revoked  certificates  into  a  DoD  Certificate  Revocation  List  (CRL).  All applications (i.e., websites, etc.) should check validity (e.g., the trust path, expiration, and revocation status) of the presented certificate prior to allowing access based on PKI authentication. 8.17.  Server  Certificates.  The AF RA is the approving authority for the issuance of Medium-Assurance DoD PKI or NSS (SIPRNet) server certificates based on validation of the certificate used  to  digitally  sign  the  email  submitting  the  certificate  request  form  (AF  RA  Form  2842-2).  The certificate request form and specific instructions to obtain and load DoD server certificates are available on the AF PKI SPO website (https://afpki.lackland.af.mil/). 8.17.1.  Reissue  a  server  certificate  when  the  fully  qualified  domain  name  (FQDN)  for  the server changes or after three years. 50 AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 8.17.2.  All  AF  Web  servers  are  issued  a  DoD  X.509  PKI  Server  certificate  and  have 128/256-bit encryption; enable the certificate at all times IAW DoDI 8520.02. 8.18.  Code Signing and Mobile Code Certificates.  Code signing and mobile code certificates are  specially  formatted  certificates  used  for  digitally  signing  executable  program  code  in  any number of languages or formats. 8.18.1.  The  sponsor  is  required  to  submit  the  request  for  code  signing  and  mobile  code certificates  to  the  Code  Signing  Attribute  Authority  (CSAA),  AFSPC  CYSS/CYZ  PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil), to  begin  the process for issuance on  a hardware token by the AF RA/AF PKI SPO.  The sponsor coordinates with the ISSM for inclusion into the security authorization  package.    For  additional  guidance,  see  the  Air  Force  Developer's  Guide  for Obtaining  DoD  Code  Signing  Certificates the  AF  PKI  SPO  website (https://afpki.lackland.af.mil/). at 8.18.1.1.  Designate  individuals  authorized  to  receive  code-signing  certificates;  ensure that such designations are kept to a minimum consistent with operational requirements. 8.18.1.2.  Upon approval from the AF Enterprise AO, the ISSM annotates compliance in the  enclave/system  authorization  package  that  code  signing  and/or  mobile  code certificates are being used SC18 and CM-5/SA-10/SI-7). 8.19.  Certificate  Reissuance  Prior  to  Expiration.  Certificate  Sponsors  (owners)  needing continued PKI services ensures reissuance of their certificates no earlier than 60 days prior to the certificate expiration date in order to prevent disruption in service. 8.20.  Network Authentication.  Enable all unclassified networks to use hardware tokens, DoD PKI  certificate-based  authentication,  and  set  authorized  user  accounts  to  require  SCL  by selecting,  “Smart  card  is  required  for  Interactive  Logon,”  in  Windows  Directory  Services environments.    Obtain  exceptions  to  this  policy  from  the  AF  Enterprise  AO  via  AFSPC CYSS/CYZ PKI, (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil). 8.21.  Directory  Services  Service  Accounts.  Service  accounts  for  Directory  Services  Service Accounts-joined servers (e.g., AREA52 or SIPRNet legacy domain) are required to comply with the  mandate  for  all  Directory  Services  Service  Accounts  to  use  SCL.    Follow  the  password complexity requirements listed in paragraph 8.5.4. 8.21.1.  Interactive logon is not allowed for any Directory Services Service Account; the use of smart cards for logon is not possible.  Therefore, a SCL exemption can be granted for Use Cases that meet the SCL exemption guidance; the base enclave ISSM should contact AFSPC CYSS/CYZ PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil) for more information. 8.21.2.  Approve service accounts through the Change Request process IAW MPTO 00-33A-1100, AFNet Operational Change Management Process.  Comply with MPTO 00-33D-2001 and  populate  the  required  Directory  Services  attributes.    The  ISSM  documents  service account approval in the security authorization package. 8.21.3.  The  ISSM  ensures  the  Service  Account  passwords  are  changed  as  required  and documents compliance in the security authorization package. 8.22.  PKI  Waivers.  Technical  solutions  should  be  evaluated  before  pursuing  a  waiver.  Coordinate to  AFSPC  CYSS/CYZ  PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil).  See DoDI 8520.02 for PKI waiver guidance. all  PKI  waiver requests and submit AFMAN17-1301  10 FEBRUARY 2017 51 8.22.1.  If AFSPC CYSS/CYZ PKI determines that  a waiver is  required, the  ISO submits a waiver  package  (Authorization  to  Operate  [ATO],  DSAWG  briefing  package,  topology diagram,  and  POA&M)  through  the  system/enclave  ISSM  to  AFSPC  CYSS/CYZ  PKI (afspc.cyss.cys.2@us.af.mil). 8.23.  PKI  LRA  Assessments.  LRAs perform annual self assessements using the AF LRA PKI Self  Assessment  Checklist (https://afpki.lackland.af.mil/html/lra_trg.cfm)  and  submit assessment results to the RAs. 8.24.  Biometric  Management.  Biometrics  should  be  fully  integrated  to  conduct  the  AF mission  in  support  of  joint  military  operations  IAW  DoDD  8521.01E,  DoD  Biometrics.  Configure  biometric  programs  IAW  the  DISA  Biometric  Security  Checklist  for  the  Access Control STIG. 8.24.1.
