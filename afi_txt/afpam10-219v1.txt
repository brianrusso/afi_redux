Introduction. Contingencies and crises arrive with many names – natural disasters, accidents, terror-ist actions, war, and military operations other than war. In colloquial English, a contingency is somethingthat can happen, but that generally is not anticipated, while a disaster is generally defined by the outcomeof a specific contingency. Hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes and successful terrorist attack are generallydisastrous when they impact our installations or local community. Disasters are not measured by the chainof results, only the final impact. Who/What was hurt, damaged, destroyed or lost and how long will it taketo restore full mission capabilities? Only rarely, can humans prevent them or control their intensity. How-ever, we can minimize their ef fects and should always be  ready to respond through the development ofvarious contingency plans. A conti ngency plan is a set of  procedures prepared in advance to respond tospecific or multiple contingencies  the base and unit may face. Many pl ans fail due to restrictive think-ing—“that’s never happened”—and for failure to think outside the box. A good plan is tailored to the baseor unit specific situation and looks  at contingencies and second to thir d order effects. Likewise, a goodplan does not look so far outside the box that it includes things that will not happen or is too unwieldy. Forinstance, if assigned to Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, a plan is not required for hurricanes or tidal waves,but would include winter storms that bases in tropical areas would not consider. By anticipating problemsand planning for them, the base and unit can rapidly mobilize the technical, financial, administrative, andengineering resources needed to minimize detrimental impact to the base. For CE units to respond effec-tively to emergencies, contingencies and disasters, procedures and plans must be in place when the inci-dent occurs. Effective post-disaster or post-attack response begins with planning and base preparationswell before a crisis threatens. The chaotic environment following a disaster or an attack is not the time orplace to begin thinking about how to respond. This pa mphlet will help you plan for contingencies anddisasters and lay out ways to minimize their impact on the mission and the personnel at your installation. 1.2.  Overview. This chapter outlines what  civil engineer units must do  to prepare for a contingency. Itbegins with an overview of potential disasters—natu ral, man-made and hostile actions—that civil engi-neers may encounter and the potential effects that accompany such events. The remainder of the chapteroutlines AF responses to disasters and outlines the differences of an on-base response versus a response insupport of the local  community or external government agency. Ultimately, our focus is to “hammerhome” the importance of predisaster planning and th e direct effect it has on successful contingencyresponses. 1.3.  Natural Disaster. Natural disasters are defined as any emergency that occurs due to an act of nature.Natural disasters include hurricanes (cyclones and typhoons), tornadoes, blizzards, floods, earthquakes,volcanic eruptions, tidal waves (tsunamis), wildfires and severe drought. Table 1.1. lists damage that canbe expected for the different strengths of natural disasters. The following paragraphs describe the causesand effects of some of these natural disasters and give civil engineer personnel some examples and poten-tial effects they may have on personnel, resources and the base. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20087Table 1.1.

A hurricane (c alled a typhoon or trop ical cyclone when formed in the PacificOcean west of the International Dateline or a cyclone in the Indian Ocean) is a potentially deadly anddevastating storm system accompanied by high winds, torrential rainfalls and lightning. Military per-sonnel assigned to any coastal region of the world could face preparing for and recovering after a hur-ricane/typhoon. Historically, hurricanes are some of  the most destructive natural events, since theyspawn flooding, tornados and landslides. Table 1.2. highlights some of the major hurricanes and trop-ical storms that had effects to Air Force bases. 10AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Table 1.2.

Some of the most noteworthy hurricane /typhoon related disasters occur in third worldcountries where construction codes and standards are not as developed as in the US. This situationresults in storms hitting areas where poorly constructed residences are located in flood prone areasresulting in massive loss of life and property. In 1970, a tropical storm killed 200,000 in East Paki-stan (now Bangladesh), according to of ficial estimates; unofficial estimates put the death toll as8-12” 13” 8-12” 4-12” 30-37” 57 47 20 47 24 10-20” 77 15-30” 16 10” 2-10” 10-28” 5-10” 7-12” 37 59 32 7 65 25 $13 $9 $14 $3.37 $5.1 $6.1 $5.9 $5.0 $3.0 $1.2 $1.8 $27.0 $2.1 $12.0 $0.4 AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200811high as 500,000. Hurricane Camille  ravaged the Gulf Coast of  Mississippi in 1969 leaving 265people dead, another 55 missing, and caused $1.5 billion in damage. In 1992, the mega-storm Hur-ricane Andrew struck the lower tip of Florida and the Gulf Coast of Louisiana (Figure 1.1.). Thehurricane caused over 60 deaths and property damage exceeded $25 billion. In that storm, Home-stead AFB was severely ravaged with damages exceeding $100 million.  In 2005, hurricane Kat-rina caused an estimated $100 billion in damage wh en it swept across the  Gulf Coast facility onAugust 29. Keesler AFB suffered extensive damage to its industrial and housing areas as a resultof its sustained winds of 110 miles-per-hour and the base wide flooding reached as high as six feetin many areas (Figure 1.2.). 1.3.1.2.  Hurricanes originate in the warm, moist  air masses of the tropi cs and move west andnorthward with enormous destructive force. The hurricane's most devastating forces are wind, tor-rential rains, and storm surge. Winds within 100 miles of the hurricane's eye can range from 75 to200 miles per hour. Lesser, but still destructive, winds may reach out as much as 250 miles fromthe center. Rainfall accompanying a hurricane is generally heavy, averaging 5 to 10 inches. Ratesin excess of 20 inches in a 24- hour period have been observed. The extreme tide, or storm surge,which can inundate the coastline, is especially hazardous. As the storm front moves inland, theheights of these hurricane tides may vary from 3- to 20-plus feet. 12AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure 1.1.  Aftermath of Hurricane Andrew at Homstead AFB, FL. Figure 1.2.  Keesler AFB, MS, Flooding from Hurricane Katrina. 1.3.1.3.  The destructive force of a  hurricane is awesome. High tides, as well as the flash floodsgenerated by the torrential rains, present walls of wate r which slam into st ructures with greatimpact. Devastating winds, accompanied by tornadoes spawned by the hu rricane, create flyingdebris and mass destruction over a widespread area. Taking in and converting to energy a quarterof a million tons of water every second, the average hurricane generates a force equal to 500,000atom bombs of the Nagasaki-type. 1.3.1.4.  The hurricane storm surge is a large dome of water, 50 to 100 miles wi de, that sweepsacross the coastline where a hurricane makes landfall. Storm surges can easily reach depths of 15feet at their peak. Along th e coast, hurricane related storm sur ge is the greatest threat to life andproperty. 1.3.1.5.  In 1995 two hurricanes, Erin in August and Opal in October, caused over $100 million indamages at Patrick, Eglin, Hurlburt, and Tyndall AFBs. Some areas were submerged in up to 18feet of water as the hurricane forced water ashor e. In 2003, Hurricane Isab el came ashore at themouth of the Chesapeake Bay at high tide, resulting in a 20 foot storm surge that flooded LangleyAFB, leaving CE to recover the base (Figure 1.3.). AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200813Figure 1.3.  Engineers at Langley AFB during Hurricane Isabel. 1.3.1.6.  On 29 August 2005, Hurricane  Katrina made landfall near New Orleans, Louisiana as aCategory 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 140 mph. The resu lting storm surge, with 20 to 30foot waves, breached the levees that protected New Orleans from a nearby lake and put 80 percentof the city under flood water as high as 20 feet deep (Figure 1.4.). Because the storm was so large,its winds and storm sur ges also caused widespread devastation along the central Gulf Coast,including Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. The final  death toll in Louisiana, Ala-bama and Mississippi is unknown, but is well-over 1,000—including those deaths directly causedby winds, flooding and storm surge and those caused indirectly by subsequent accidents, fires andhealth issues. The economic impact is predicted to reach as high as $200  billion, including unin-sured losses. Federal disaster declarations cover 90,000 square miles, an area almost the size of theUnited Kingdom. By affecting such vast urban and in dustrialized areas, Hurricane Katrina hasbeen called the worst catastrophe in the history of the United States. Figure 1.4.  Levee Breach in New Orleans Caused by Hurricane Katrina. 1.3.2.  Tornadoes. Tornadoes are the most violent weather phenome na known to man. Although theareas affected by these funnel-shaped clouds are generally limited from 1/4 to 1/3 of a mile wide andseldom more than 16 miles long, the rotatin g velocities can reach 300 miles per hour ( Figure 1.5.).Air pressure within the funnel can be so low as to cause buildings to explode from the higher pressureinside the structure. These high winds and pressure differentials make tornadoes one of the biggestnatural disaster killers in the United States. 14AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure 1.5.  Tornado Moving Across Land. 1.3.2.1.  During the past 25 years, tornadoes have killed almost three times as many people as hur-ricanes. Tornadoes occur in all  50 states, but are most prevalent in the Midwest and Southeast.Although tornadoes occur throughout the year, weather conditions for tornado development arebest from April through June. Unlike other weather disasters, the suddenness and the erratic pathof the tornado seldom afford an opportunity to evacuate the danger area. For these reasons, timelywarning, good predisaster planning and immediate availability of shelters become critical factorsin saving lives and minimizing damage. 1.3.2.2.  On April 26, 1991, an F-5 catastrophic tornado touched down and tracked through McCo-nnell AFB. The Wichita/Andover Tornado caused $62 million damage to the McConnell flightlineand facilities, tracking within 2,000 yards of 80 F-16 fighter aircraft ( Figure 1.6.). Tinker AFBalso had tornados touch down in 1948 and 1982  causing millions in da mage. CE units in tor-nado-prone areas must be ready to respond to not only recover the base but also support local com-munities when they are hit. Figure 1.6.  Tornado Damage at McConnell AFB, April 1991. 1.3.3.  Blizzards and Severe Cold. Although blizzards and severe cold do not normally cause the wide-spread structural damage and death associated w ith tornadoes and hurricanes, this type weather cangreatly hamper normal airbase operations. The heavy snows which accompany blizzards cause manyactivities to grind to a halt. The build-up of ice makes roads and r unways unusable as well as snapsoverhead power lines. Water supply lines may fr eeze and rupture. Record low temperatures put astrain on heating systems, causing numerous failures that have to be repaired if operations are to con-tinue. A significant limiting factor under these conditions will be the reduced effectiveness of person-AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200815nel and equipment required to make repairs in an extremely cold environment. Also, reduced visibilityis a “must consider” factor. Individuals can easily get lost responding to a problem during a blizzard. 1.3.4.  Earthquakes. An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the Earth caused by the breaking andshifting of rock beneath the Earth’s surface. For hundreds of millions of years, the forces of plate tec-tonics have shaped the Earth as huge plates that form the Earth’s surface move slowly over, under andpast each other. Sometimes the movement is gradual.  At other times, the plates are locked together ,unable to release the accumulating  energy. When the accumulated en ergy grows strong enough, theplates break free causing the earth to shake. Most earthquakes occur at the boundaries where the platesmeet, however, some earthquakes occur in the middle of the plates. 1.3.4.1.  Ground shaking from earthquake s can collapse buildings and  bridges; disrupt gas, elec-tric, and phone service; and sometimes trigger landslides, avalanches, flash floods, fires, and huge,destructive ocean waves (tidal waves/tsunamis). Building with foundations resting on unconsoli-dated landfill and other unstable soil, and trailers and  homes not tied to thei r foundations are atrisk because they can be shaken off their mountings during large scale earthquakes. When earth-quakes occur in populated area they can result in large death tolls and extensive property damage. 1.3.4.2.  Northridge California was struck by a 6.7 magnitude Earthquake on 17 January 1994. Thedeath toll in this densely populat ed area was 60 with another 1,50 0 injuries. Electricity, gas andwater service was damaged and interrupted for almost 50,000 people. The relatively low casualtyand structural failure rate is credited to US  construction seismic codes and superior constructionstandards. Although the damage seemed relatively low for an eart hquake of this magnitude, theeconomic impact was estimated at $2 0 billion. Conversely, Kobe Japan, exactly one year to theday later, was hit by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake. The earthquake lasted 20 seconds and collapsedhouses, wrecked roadways, ignited fires and destro yed Japan’s sixth largest city. It resulted in5,500 deaths, 35,000 injuries, ap proximately 180,000 buildings damaged and 310,000 peoplehomeless. At an economic impact of $147 billion, the Kobe earthquake is one of the costliest nat-ural disasters on record ( Figure 1.7.). A December 2003 earthquake in the town of Bam, Iranresulted in an estimated 50,000 casualties and reduced  and entire city to rubble. Many poor anddeveloping countries have very few construction guidelines which results in low-grade construc-tion and weak buildings structures. Good planning, construction standards and federal/local guide-lines allow the US to minimize damage. Al though CE cannot eliminate earthquake damage,engineers can significantly mitigate the threat through sound  construction practices and strongpredisaster planning. 16AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure 1.7.  Earthquake Damage in Kobe, Japan. 1.3.4.3.  A repetition of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake under current conditions would causebillions of dollars in damage and result in the loss of thousands of lives. The small 1989 Loma Pri-eta quake just south of San Francisco measured only 7.1 on the Richter scale, but killed 62 peopleand damaged property valued over $6 billion. 1.3.4.4.  Earthquakes strike suddenly, without warning. There is no particular season as with mon-soons or hurricanes, and they ca n occur anywhere. The state of  California experiences the mostfrequent damaging earthquakes, while Alaska has the greatest frequency of earthquakes. The larg-est US earthquakes were felt during a three-month period from 1811 to 1812 along the N ewMadrid Fault line in Missouri. These 8.0 magnitude earthquakes were felt throughout the EasternUnited States in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Alabama, Arkansas andMississippi experiencing the strongest tremors. 1.3.4.5.  Depending on the magnitude, the primary effects of earthquakes can be dramatic and dev-astating. Large horizontal and vertical land mass displacements can  create fissures along majorfault lines. Bridges, buildings, da ms, tunnels and other rigid struct ures can be sheared in two orcollapse when subjected to the  extreme lateral forces created  by earthquakes. Water in tanks,ponds and rivers frequently overflow their banks.  In lakes, an oscillation sometimes occurs inwhich the water surges from one end to the other reaching heights sufficient to create a mini-tidalsurge. During the 1964 Alaskan ear thquake, this lake effect caused a tidal surge of six feet inMemphis, Tennessee, 5,000 miles from the center of the earthquake. The January 1994 NorthridgeEarthquake, near Los Angeles, which measured 6.6, injured more than  7,300 people, killed 56people and caused damage exceeding $15 billion to buildings and roads and ruptured power, waterand gas lines. 1.3.4.6.  Secondary effects of earthquakes are often more destructive than the earthquake itself.Landslides resulting from earthquakes in mountainous areas are frequently a major cause of liveslost. In May 1970, an earthquake registering 7.9 on the Richter scale created a massive avalancheof the glacier on Mt. Huasaran, Peru. This avalanch e started as a sliding mass of glacial ice, rockand mud 3,000 feet wide and one mile long. The avalanche swept away 11 miles of Earth destroy-ing the villages of Yungay and Ranrahirca at speeds in excess of 100 mph. The death toll from thisearthquake and subsequent floods was approximately 66,000 people with another 600,000 lefthomeless. Fire is often a by-product of earthquakes. The damage caused by these fires can also beAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200817greater than normal, due to loss  of firefighting equipment, blockage of access routes to the firescene, and the breaking of water mains essential to firefighting. This was demonstrated during theSan Francisco earthquake of 1906, in  which 80 percent of the half  billion dollars in damage wasdue to the fires which raged out of control for da ys following the tremor. Other secondary effectsof earthquakes include disruption of utilities, transportation, and communication systems, and thecreation of tsunamis (seismic sea waves). 1.3.4.7.  On 26 December 2004, an undersea earthquake occurred in the Indian Ocean off the west-ern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The earthquake’s magnitude was estimated at 9.15 and lastednearly ten minutes, whereas most major earthquakes last no more than a few seconds. The earth-quake created a 750 mile r upture in the sea bed, displaced an  estimated 20 square miles of waterand triggered a devastating tsunami. A tsunami is a series of wave s generated when water is rap-idly displaced on a massive scale—earthquakes, landslides, volcanoes and large meteorite impactsall have the potential to genera te a tsunami. The 2004 tsunami  was the single worst in recordedhistory, killing over 300,000 pe ople (Figure 1.8.). The true deat h toll may never be knownbecause tens of thousands were swept out to sea and reported  as missing, while an incalculablenumber died from subsequent di sease. Perhaps the most striking exa mple of the power of thisdisaster was that deaths attributed to it were recorded up to 5,000 miles from the earthquakes epi-center. Despite a time lag of several hours between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami,nearly all the victims were taken completely by surprise. One possible reason: there were no tsu-nami warning systems in the Indian Ocean. In the disaster’s aftermath, there is a new awareness ofthe need for such warning systems and there are proposals to create a unified global tsunami warn-ing system, to include the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean. 18AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure 1.8.  Before and After Pictures of Tsunami in Banda Aceh, Sumatra. 1.3.5.  Floods. Flooding can occur from any accumulation or rise of water on a land area (Figure 1.9.).Unusually heavy rains can run into streams or rivers causing it to overflow its banks. Runoff from thesudden melting of accumulated winter snow can add great amounts of water to rivers causing floodingdownstream. The heavy rains and  storm surge which accompany hurricanes can cause flooding oflow-lying coastal areas. Some floods result from th e failure of man-made barriers, such as dams andlevees, which attempted to control water flow. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200819Figure 1.9.  Flooded Homes in New Orleans After Hurricane Katrina. 1.3.5.1.  The primary effects of floods are due to inundation and the force of the currents. Flood-water and current-borne debris can drown, displace, or injure local residents. These same currentsand debris can cause structural damage to bridges, buildings, and ro ads as well as interrupt vitalutility services over a large area. Health hazards can be created through disruption of water andsanitary systems. Electrical fires can be caused by short circuits and the hazard of fire or explosioncan be increased from broken gas mains. Environmental and public health hazards are createdwhen chemical storage facilities are damaged. 1.3.5.2.  Floods may occur at any time of the year. They are more common because of heavy win-ter rains or the spring thaw of accumulated ice  and snow in the United States. The warmer, morehumid regions of the world often experience flooding during the monsoonal or rainy seasons. Theduration of a flood's impact varies. Flash floods generally rise rapidly over a period of just a fewhours and subside just as quickly, while floods in the great river basins may last for weeks. In thegreat flood of 1993, the Mississippi River exceeded flood stage in some areas for over 100 days. 1.3.6.  Volcanic Activity. Volcanoes are a rare but a very potent menace. Some 80 percent of all volca-noes are contained in the "ring of  fire" which circumscribes the  Pacific Ocean. Active volcanoes inthese areas are few in number, and the areas near most active volcanoes are sparsely populated. How-ever, as Mount St. Helens in Washington State (Figure 1.10.) proved in 1980 and Mount Pinatubo inthe Philippines (Figure 1.11.) in June 1991, even inactive volcanoes should be considered as only dor-mant and a potential source of danger. The Pinatubo explosion caused over $300 million in base dam-age at Clark AB and contributed to its closure and that of nearby Subic Naval Base. 20AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure 1.10.  Mount St Helens Eruption, May 1980. Figure 1.11.  CE Break Area at Mount Pinatubo Recovery, Clark AB. 1.3.6.1.  The underlying cause of volcanoes is the formation of molten rock (magma) through theprocess of orogenesis (mountain building). Shifting rocks are  forced to great depths, whereincreased temperature and pressure cause them to dissol ve and be converted to magma. Onceformed, this magma exerts pressure on surrounding solid material. If solid material has fissuresrunning toward the surface, molten rock will surge upward to form a volcano. 1.3.6.2.  The major dangers posed by volcanic eruptions are lava flows, airborne clouds of volca-nic ash, toxic gases, and volcanic mudflows. Because of devastating forces of volcanic eruptions,reduction of damage has proved to be difficult. Lava flows may be slowed or diverted by strategi-AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200821cally located stone barricades, but major prot ection involves evacuation of personnel and equip-ment away from the danger zone. 1.3.7.  Lightning. Lightning is an electrical discharge from mature storm clouds (Figure 1.12.). Light-ning is one of the deadly off spring of hurricanes, tornados and normal storms. On average, lightningcauses more casualties annually in the US than any other storm related phenomena, except for floods.Simple training and basic planning can reduce many of the dangers posed by lightning. Figure 1.12.  Lightning Strikes. 1.3.7.1.  In 1996, a single lightning strike  at Eglin AFB, Florida, resulted in the death of one andinjury of 11 Airmen working on the flightline. During natural  disaster contingency response,resources and personnel are limited. Through proper training and planning, CE can maximize theeffectiveness of the response force. 1.3.8.  Wild Fires. A wild fire is defined as an unplanned fire requiring suppression action. In contrast,prescribed wilderness fires burn  within prepared lines, enclosing a designated area, under predeter-mined conditions. Due to a severe lack of cleara nce of underbrush and periodic drought years, ourbrush lands, forests and foothills are tinderboxes dur ing late summers. Often a series of lightningstrikes or careless actions by humans will result is a series of fires burning in a localized area. 1.3.8.1.  Air Force firefighters and Readiness/ Emergency Management personnel are oftenrequested to assist with suppression and planning  actions when local resources become stretchedto thin. During many of the California wild fire months, Vandenberg and Beale have found them-selves with large brush fires encroaching upon the base (Figure 1.13.). 22AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure 1.13.  Southern California Wild Fires, 2003. 1.3.8.2.  The Base Civil Engineer, Base Fire Marshal, and th e Fire Chief must be prepared todefend the base from wild fires as well as support local fire fighters when required. Off base sup-port should be determined  well in advance through mutual aid agreements, memorandums ofunderstanding or support agreements. Military firefighters have matured this concept to includejoint training exercises and operations thereby solidifying a working relationship. This partnershipresults in almost seamless operations during an emergency response since all of the parties under-stand their roles and responsibilities and have practiced them in joint exercises. 1.3.9.  Conclusions. There are numerous other natural disasters that  civil engineer units might beforced to contend with in worldwide operations. In planning for contingencies and disasters, the CivilEngineer and base leadership shou ld consult with local emer gency managers to ensure they includeresponses to common local contingencies not listed  above. All civil engineers should remember oneimportant point: never underestimate the destructive force of nature . Effective warning systems areneeded, as is a mitigation plan. The plan should  be designed to limit damage or casualties throughpre-planned actions (i.e., site selection, permanent dikes, shelters, etc.) or expedient actions (i.e.,sandbagging, tying down, shoring up, evacuation, etc.). 1.4.  Man-Made Disasters. A man made disaster is defined as an emergency that occurs directly or indi-rectly because of some human acti on. Civil engineer units  may be faced with ove rcoming the effects ofman made disasters that occur on base or off base. This section outlines potential man made disasters andaddresses the anticipated recovery environment presented by each. The Federal Emergency ManagementAgency (FEMA) now refers to man made disasters as “technological disasters.” 1.4.1.  Fire and Explosion. Fires and explosions are closely related disasters. In many cases, a fire rag-ing out of control in an area where flammable materials are stored can cause an explosion; or, an unex-pected explosion can spread flam e and hot debris over a  large area causing the start and spread of amajor fire (Figure 1.14.). While some fires, such  as those caused by lightni ng, can be considered anatural disaster, the majority of fires start as a result of some human action. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200823Figure 1.14.  Aftermath of Explosion at Industrial Plant. 1.4.1.1.  Fires can be grouped into two general categories: facilities and grasslands. The first cate-gory can range in intensity from those involving man-made structures, facilities, or a small kitchenfire to a major aircraft or petroleum fire aerospace vehicles and those involving forests or involv-ing thousands of gallons of highly flammable material. Forest and grassland fires can be an evengreater problem. They can cover thousands of acres, requiring wide dispersal of limited firefight-ing equipment, and resources. 1.4.1.2.  Explosions present a threat to personnel near the blast. There is danger from the force ofa blast, flying debris, and intense heat and flam e that may be produced by an explosion. Naturalgas, liquid petroleum, and munitions storage facilities are potential explosion sites. In December1984, a gas explosion and resulting inferno in a Mexico City suburb demonstrated the destructiveforce of these type disasters. A  series of explosions destroyed  four spherical tanks, each holdingalmost 500,000 gallons of liquefied gas, and se nt enormous steel shards spearing into nearbyhouses. Flames from the blast shot  more than 300 feet into the  dawn sky, instantly engulfinghomes and other structures that surrounded the ga s plant. Subsequent blasts hurled 50-foot-longpropane cylinders into the air, crushing houses as far as half a mile from the explosion site. It wasseveral hours before firefighters could contain the flames sufficiently to enter the area. When theyfinally entered the zone of devastation, they found corpses carbonized in gestures of self-defense.Some were huddled together; others lay alone in their beds, arms raised in defense. 1.4.1.3.  Response to a fire or explosion involves  both firefighting and rescue of endangered per-sonnel. The first step is to cont ain the blaze as much  as possible and rescue any personnel in thearea. The next step is to gain control of the fire to minimize further damage. After these tasks areaccomplished, major efforts are devoted to completely extinguish the fire. Other civil enginee rteams may be called on to  support the firefighters. Reconstruc tion following a fire or explosiondepends on the magnitude of the disaster, but likely, it will require combined efforts of craftsmenwith varying skills. 1.4.2.  Hazardous Materials and  Radioactive Contamination. If allowed to escape into the environ-ment, toxic gases, harmful chemicals, or radioactive contam inants can pose significant hazards to24AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008humans. These substances can be accidentally released into the environment at manufacturing plants,at storage facilities, during transit to another location, or at points of use. Nuclear power plants, toxicgas and chemical manufacturing facilities, and hazardous materials storage depots have numeroussafeguards to prevent accidents. When these dangerous substances are transported, they are normallyencased in special rupture-proof containers to prevent leakage in  the event of a road or rail accident.But even with all these special precautions, accidents have and will continue to occur. When this hap-pens, the accidental escape of these lethal subs tances into the atmosphere or on the ground couldresult in thousands of deaths. 1.4.2.1.  The 1984 toxic ga s leak in India serves as an exam ple of how quickly toxic fumes canengulf and kill thousands. Methyl isocyanine, a deadly chemical used to make pesticides, began toescape from a Union Carbide plant on the outskirts of Bhopal a few minutes past midnight. Withinan hour, the gas had formed a vast, dense fog of death that drifted over the city, leaving hundredsdead as they slept. As  word of the cloud of poi son began to spread, thousands began to flee thefumes. 1.4.2.2.  Many individuals died while fleeing the noxious vapor, while others who had inhaled thefumes died hours later from the  effects, having reached what they thought was safety. By week’send, more than 2,500 people were dead, and thousands more suffered permanent blindness or dis-abling respiratory disorders (Figure 1.15.). Figure 1.15.  Clean Up After Union Carbide Plant Gas Leak in India. 1.4.2.3.  Toxic gases, harmful chemicals, and radioactive contamination can have a lasting impacton the environment. Some of these substances can render large land areas and water sources unus-able for years. To minimize the effects of these toxic materials, civil engineers must be prepared toassist in containment and cleanup activities. 1.4.3.  Petroleum Spills. Unlike the highly toxic substances discussed in the preceding section, petro-leum spills are not normally life-th reatening to humans even though they do pr esent a fire hazard.However, a petroleum spill can have a devastating impact on the environment. Water supplies can becontaminated, plants destroyed, and wildlife killed or injured. Marine  plants and animals are espe-cially susceptible to the effects of petroleum spills in or near water so urces and particularly ourAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200825oceans. As with toxic materials, a civil engineer's primary responsibilities will be to assist in contain-ment and cleanup activities. 1.4.4.  Major Accident. With humans, accidents are not just  possible; they are probable. Around anairbase, aircraft accidents are always a possibility ( Figure 1.16.). Whether involving a military or acivilian aircraft, a major aircraft accident could require the assistance of civil engineers. Trained fire-fighting and rescue personnel could be required to  extinguish fires associated with an aircraft crashand use special skills to rescue persons trapped within an aircraft. If the accident occurs in an inacces-sible area, rescue and investigatio n teams may require the support of  other civil engineer pe rsonneland equipment to gain access to the crash site. However, not all major accidents will involve aircraft.The possibilities are endless. An accident can be  the act that complicates a dis aster by triggering anexplosion, a petroleum spill, or a  toxic gas leak. Major accidents requi re multi-unit response by thebase Disaster Response Force (D RF). Minor accidents are handled  by responders such as the firedepartment, security forces, and medical services. Figure 1.16.  Airshow Aircraft Accident. 1.4.5.  Planning for Man made Disasters. The types of man made di sasters that could occur are toonumerous to make specific plans fo r each. Effective planning in this area consists of evaluating thebase and its surrounding area to id entify activities that have poten tial to develop into a damagingemergency. After the evaluation, c ourses of action and prioritized act ivities should be established toreduce the seriousness of such emergencies, should they occur. 1.5.  Hostile Actions. Hostile actions,  although they can come from ma ny sources, have the same basicobjectives. They are intended to kill personnel, destroy equipment and facilities, and generally reduce theability of a base to carry out its assigned combat mission. The following paragraphs highlight the types ofattacks that are expected, based upon the current world situation. 1.5.1.  Conventional Attack. A conventional attack can take many forms: ground forces supported byartillery and armored vehicles; ai rborne troops and equipment dropped behind our defenses; highspeed bombers and fighters dropp ing bombs and firing missiles ; and naval bombardments fromoff-shore ships or submarines. The primary objective for strikes against our airbases will be to destroyaircraft and weapons systems, comm and and control systems, and if th at is not possible, then inflictheavy damage on runways, POL storage areas, and  munitions storage facilities. This damage is26AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008intended to prevent us from being  able to launch and recover combat  aircraft, and it  is that damagewhich civil engineers will be called on to fix first. 1.5.1.1.  The explosion of a typical bomb or missile produces shock waves and concussion whichcan level structures and kill personnel near the point of detonation. Flying debris and bomb frag-ments or shrapnel can cause severe damage and injury at distances well beyond the impact point.The extreme temperatures that accompany an explosion can start major fires, particularly if flam-mable materials are in the proximity of an explosion. If incendiary bombs are used, their thickenedburning agents will create havoc  over widespread areas. Other  fires may originate from shortedelectrical circuits, ruptured gas lines and fuel tanks, and the spread of burning embers. 1.5.1.2.  Even after an attack is over, danger still lurks in the form of unexploded ordnance. WorldWar II history records that approximately 10 percent of all bombs dropped during an air raid failedto explode, either through some type of  malfunction or because they were fused for del ayedaction. Also, buried and exposed  mines and sub munitions intenti onally create a very dif ficultpostattack environment. Regardless of reasons,  civil engineer's explosive ordnance disposal(EOD) and repair crews will have to function in this hazardous environment. 1.5.2.  Chemical Attack. Often called the poor man's atomic bomb, chemical agents have been devel-oped to kill and disable opposing forces dating as far back as the ancient Greeks. In this century, dur-ing World War I, thousands of troo ps were killed or seriously injure d by the effects of mustard andchlorine gas as they fought in the trenches of Europe ( Figure 1.17.). Italian Premier, Benito Musso-lini, ordered the use of mustard gas in several battles in 1936 during Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia. Her-man Goering, former Marshal of Hitler's Reich, te stified at the Nuremberg war crimes trial that theGermans would have used gas aga inst the Allies in the invasion of Norm andy but for the danger tohorses that were a vital part of Germany's transportation system. Major General Alden H. Waitt, Chiefof US Army Chemical Warfare Service at the time, estimated that German use of chemical weaponswould have delayed the invasion by six months and made new landing points necessary. Is chemicalwarfare a thing of the past? Although both sides denied it, the use of chemical warfare agents was con-firmed in the 1980-1988 conflict between Iran and Iraq. Soldiers returning from the front were treatedfor severe burns and blisters, a common symptom of  exposure to certain chemical agents. In somecases, whole villages were affected. Within one week of ending the war with Iran in March 1988, evi-dence and testimony indicates that Saddam Hussein utilized CW against the Kurds in Northern Iraq,killing at least 5,000. Further evidence indicates that forces supported by the Soviet Union used chem-ical warfare agents in Laos, the Khmer Republic  (formerly Cambodia) and Afghanistan during the1980s. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200827Figure 1.17.  Casualties from Chemical Attack. 1.5.2.1.  How will modern chemical warfare be em ployed next? Chemical agents could be dis-pensed from large and small missiles or rockets, dropped from airplanes in canister-type bomblets,sprayed from aircraft, or disp ensed by ground troops  as they advance on  strategic positions.Regardless of the method, the re sults would be the same—no mushroom cloud or devastation ofthe airbase – only a fine mist or cloud that drifts gently over the area. It could easily be invisible,odorless, and tasteless. Perhaps individuals would  breathe a sigh of relief at  being spared from anuclear attack or a blitz of  1,000-pound bombs and return to normal activities. Within minutes,many people outside during the attack could be dying from  massive seizures and convulsions,while the base and its weapons systems are left intact and undamaged. 1.5.2.2.  Those who survive the  initial chemical attack cannot consider themselves completelysafe. Air Force chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) de fense operations relyupon risk-based decision making, i ndividual and collective protection equipment, and integratedindividual, unit, and airbase actions. 1.5.2.2.1.  Air Force units will retain the ability to operate under all conditions, but will focustheir primary efforts on conducting combat operations under the CBRN conditions expected atairbases. Single attacks and factors such as the type of agent and en vironmental conditions,may require wearing protective equipment for several minutes to hours. Multiple attacks, theuse of newly developed chemic al or biological agents, a nd unfavorable weather conditionsmay extend wear times or require repeated donning and doffing over extended periods. 1.5.2.2.2.  Airmen and leaders develop plans and execute attack response actions to limit con-tamination. They perform immediate and operational decontamination and conduct rapidpost-attack reconnaissance to detect, identify, and/or segregate contaminated resources andareas. 1.5.2.2.3.  Personnel should use uncontaminated assets to the extent possible in the post-attackenvironment. The UCC directs unit personnel to  accomplish mission essential tasks and stopnon-mission essential tasks. The UCCs monitor  the contamination status of people, equip-ment, and areas. UCCs also instruct unit personnel to minimize movement, especially betweencontaminated and uncontaminated zones. Individuals or teams  do not enter or exit contami-nated areas or move contaminated equipment into uncontaminated areas without UCC or EOC28AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008approval. Personnel go to contamination control areas or reduce MOPP when directed by theirunit or the EOC. See AFMAN  10-2602, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional(NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards, for more information on the Air Force CBRNoperational concept. 1.5.3.  Biological Attack. Biological warfare is not new. The Black Death (plague) was transmitted tothe Europeans in the 1300s when a Kipchak army , besieging a Genosese trading post in the Crimea,catapulted plague-infested corpses into the town. The British employed biological warfare against theIndians in the French and Indian War in the mid-1700s. Of all types of warfare, a biological attack isthe most difficult to recognize. At first, it may seem just a routine illness such as a cold or flu. But asa lot of personnel begin to show  the same symptoms or when th ose symptoms become increasinglyserious and personnel become ill and die, individuals begin to realize they have been exposed to bio-logical agents. 1.5.3.1.  Many pathogens can be em ployed as biological warfare ag ents. The effects of thesepathogens range from a minor in capacitating illness to sudden death. Aircraft spray, aerosolbombs and generators, missiles, infected animals, vials, capsules, or hand dispensers can dissemi-nate biological agents. The effectiveness of biological agents depends on the targets, the nature ofthe military operations at the target, and the weather. 1.5.3.2.  Combating a biological agent is very difficult. Since there are no suitable antidotes for themore virulent strains of pathogens, the best defense is to prevent them  from entering the bodythrough the common routes – nose, mouth, and skin. Outside of the body, these pathogens do noteasily survive. They are killed by variations in temperature, lack of moisture, exposure to sunlight,and application of various germicides. One of the best defenses against pathogens is to have per-sonnel don protective ensembles  at the first suspicion of an  attack. Maintaining good personalhygiene and physical conditioning, al ong with keeping immunizations current, go a long way toprevent infections. Currently, detection of biological agents is very difficult. They are normallyidentified only after their effects start showing up. 1.5.4.  Nuclear Attack. Of all of the types of attacks that may be experienced, the nuclear attack is themost awesome and frightening. A single nuclear bomb can cause more death and destruction thanthousands of conventional bombs and has the additional effect of making an entire area uninhabitablefor months, or even years, to come. However, with sufficient warning and appropriate precautions, thedevastating effects of a nuclear blast can be reduced. The explosion of two nuclear bombs over Japanin August 1945, the first and only nuclear weapons ever used against an enemy, caused unprecedentedcasualties. Yet, many of these casualties could have been prevented if there had been sufficient warn-ing to permit clearing the streets, and if the pe ople of Hiroshima and Na gasaki had known what toexpect and what to do. For example, only 400 people out of a population of almost a quarter of a mil-lion were inside the excellent tunnel shelters at Nagasaki that could have protected 75,000 people. 1.5.4.1.  A nuclear explosion, like a conventional expl osion, is due to the rapid release of a lar geamount of energy all at once. However, with the nuclear explosion,  the energy results from rear-rangement within the central portion, or nucleus  of an atom, rather than among the atoms them-selves as in a chemical  explosion. Since the forces existing between protons and neutrons in anucleus are much greater than are forces between the atoms in a molecule of chemical explosivematerial, the resultant release of energy is enormous. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008291.5.4.2.  Effects of a nuclear attack are numerous. There are extreme blast or shock waves, thermalradiation, nuclear radiation, and enormous electromagnetic energy. The blast or shock wave is themost destructive (Figure 1.18.). It accounts for 50 percent of  the expended energy, creating tre-mendous over pressures and winds that can crumble buildings and other structures for a consider-able distance around the detonation point. The atmosphere immediately surrounding a detonationpoint is raised to temperatures approaching those in th e center of the sun,  instantly vaporizingbuildings and people in the area. This thermal ra diation also has the ef fect of causing secondaryfires and serious burns to exposed persons miles from the point of detonation. Nuclear radiation isespecially intense close to ground zero. The lingering, cumulative effect of exposure to radioactivefallout can continue to cause death and radiation sickness for days, weeks, or longer following anattack. In addition, the great electromagnetic ener gy, generated by nuclear weapons, can tempo-rarily disrupt radio communications and permanently damage electronic components. Figure 1.18.  Nuclear Test at Bikini Atoll. 1.5.4.3.  Radioactive fallout will be the greatest danger during operations following an attack. Per-sonnel working in contaminated areas will have to be closely monitored for cumulative radiationdoses and complete personal decontamination will have to be accomplished prior to their return toshelter areas. Additionally, the civil engineer unit will likely be called upon to decontaminate cer-tain areas of the base so that recovery activities can proceed. 1.5.5.  Terrorism. While terrorist acts were once mainly viewed as random acts of deranged individu-als, they have emerged as highly organized operations, conducted with military precision against stra-tegic activities and targets. September 11th, 2001, brought home the deadly reality of terrorism in theUnited States. Nineteen men affiliated with the Al Qaeda network of Islamic or ganizations, high-jacked four commercial airliners. They intentionally crashed two airliners into the World Trade Centerin New York City and another one into the DOD  headquarters, the Pentagon, in Arlington, Virginia(Figure 1.19.). The fourth plane crashed into a rural field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, follow-ing passenger resistance. This terrorist attack  killed 2,595 people in New York, 189 at the Pentagonand 45 in Pennsylvania, including everyone aboard the four airliners; altogether 2,986 fatalities. Thesewere the most lethal terrorist acts ever carried ou t in the United S tates and most lethal individualattacks in the world. Al Qaeda had previously been involved in attacks on American targets overseas,notably American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000. Pre-30AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008viously, an attack was made on the US Marine compound in Beirut in 1983 ( Figure 1.20.). In thatattack, the terrorist crashed a tr uck laden with explosives through the compound fence, killing morethan 200 US servicemen. This incident also demons trated that our future protective measures wouldhave to go beyond what would stop a reasonable person. This method of attacking US service person-nel was also used in November 1995 at the United States Military Training Mission in Riyadh, SaudiArabia, which killed seven individuals and again in June 1996 in the bombing of the USAF dormitoryat Khobar Towers, near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 US servicemen. Figure 1.19.  Pentagon Recovery Operations after Terrorist Attack. Figure 1.20.  Khobar Towers Dormitory in Saudi Arabia after Explosion. 1.5.5.1.  In the words of former Secretary of State George Schultz, terrorism is “a new kind of war-fare” and is being practiced with an increasing degree of frequency. No longer is terror the exclu-sive weapon of the fanatic, terrorism is now endorsed, encouraged, and funded by governments inan attempt to achieve political objectives. 1.5.5.2.  It is no longer safe to as sume that only those exposed locat ions in areas of internationaltension are at risk. The world terrorist honors no country's borders, traveling widely to bring deathAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200831and destruction to those considered as enemie s. In fact, terrorists  from the Middle East haveboasted that even the residents of the White House  should not consider themselves safe fromextremist actions. "Home grown" terrorists are just as deadly. 1.5.5.3.  The most frighte ning aspect of terrorism today is that highly technological weapons ofwar, once possessed only by  military forces of the world's la rger nations, are now available tothese radical groups. What would happen if sophist icated nuclear, chemical, or biological weap-ons fell into the hands of thes e unpredictable elements? The consequences, in light of their ruth-less disregard for innocent human lives, are  unthinkable. The 1993 bombing of the W orld TradeCenter in New York, the 1995 release of nerve and bli ster agents in the Tokyo subway, and the1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City reinforce this point. 1.6.  Operations Other Than War. With increasing frequency, military forces are used for operations notassociated with combat. Such operations include Operation PROVIDE COMFORT following the PersianGulf War in 1991; the peacekeeping efforts in Haiti in 1994; and the rescue, detainment, and housing ofCuban refugees during both the Muriel Boatlift in 1980 and the over water exodus of 1994. It is difficultto deliberately plan for these operations since their requirements, timing, and location are unknown. How-ever, the common threads in many operations are a need to beddown forces or provide a camp for refugeesor disaster victims. These are activ ities which military forces should be  able to support through normalreadiness activities. 1.7.  Air Force Involvement. Disasters a nd other crises temporarily cha nge Air Force activities on abase—but not priorities; the mission still comes first.  In a crisis, all base or ganizations must focus onrestoring or maintaining the primary base mission, saving lives, reducing damage, and restoring missionessential resources. The nature of a crisis dictates the magnitude, the urgency, and the specific responsesof the base recovery effort. In most cases prompt ac tion is mandatory, and a team ef fort is required tomount an effective response. But a team ef fort does not just happen. The ba se team has to be built,equipped, trained, and exercised. Th e unpredictable nature of crises requires that each base and unit beprepared for a variety of circumstances. While a base cannot be prepared for every possible crisis, it canbe prepared for realistic worst-case scenarios. A meas ure of a base's preparati on is its ability to quicklyadapt to unplanned situations. 1.8.  Civil Engineers’ Role. Civil engineers play a key role on an airbase. Each day, civil engineer person-nel support more activities and units on a base than does any other organization. Not surprising then, civilengineers are involved in more pre- and post-disaster tasks than any other unit. We take the lead in emer-gency response planning. Engineers assist in vulnerability reduction by  constructing shelters, dispersingequipment, camouflaging facilities, and much more. We assess damage, fight fires, clear hazards, provideemergency utilities, beddown military forces and disaster victims, repair facility damage, and control andmonitor contamination. 1.8.1.  Superb civil engineer support is vital for an airbase to perform its mission before, during, andafter a crisis. Effective support of the airbase mission requires each member of the civil engineer teamto be organized, equipped, and trained to react to a variety of contingencies. This is true for everyonefrom the commander to the lowest ranking Airmen. It applies to all CE specialties including firefight-ing, EOD, and Readiness/Emergency Management. The civil engineer's response to disasters andother contingencies is not limited to  a unit's home base. Mobile engi neer forces must be capable ofproviding CE support anywhere in the world on short notice. 32AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20081.8.2.  While civil engineers are major players, always remember that civil engineers are only part ofthe base team. We must work cooperatively with the other base units to plan, prepare for, and respondto peacetime emergencies, man-made disasters, and war. 1.8.3.  Engineer forces must be prepared to fulf ill their mission requirements across the broad spec-trum of conflicts and under a full range of environments. In a ddition to providing essential facilities,utilities, and support whenever and wherever required to support CONUS and theater operations, CEforces will: 1.8.3.1.  Perform emergency repair of war damage to airbases. 1.8.3.2.  Support force beddown of Air Force units and weapons systems. 1.8.3.3.  Accomplish essential operations and maintenance functions for existing, as well as addi-tional bases, facilities, and utilities. 1.8.3.4.  Provide aircraft rescue fi re fighting (ARFF), fire suppression, and other emergency ser-vices. 1.8.3.5.  Perform detection, manage MOPP transition point requirements, collect detection infor-mation from UCCs, perform risk management assessment, conduct plume analysis, and advisecommanders on contamination risks and recommended mitigation in a CBRN environment. 1.8.3.6.  Identify, safe, and dispose of unexploded ordnance. 1.8.3.7.  In the event the decision is made to abandon the airbase; CE will be instrumental in basedenial, which is the functional destruction by any means available of facilities, utility systems, andequipment to deny their use to the enemy. 1.8.3.8.  Manage or oversee a ll repair, construction, operation, and maintenance activities con-ducted by Air Force, Army, wartime host nation support (WHNS), or contractor organizations onAir Force facilities and installations. 1.8.3.9.  Augment Major Command/Numbered Air Force (MAJCOM/NAF) staffs. 1.8.3.10.  Ensure that the mission is carried out in a manner consistent with national environmentalpolicies. 1.8.3.11.  Assist in reconstitution of bare base assets following their use. 1.8.3.12.  Provide installation emergency management support, coordination of incident manage-ment efforts, incident action planning, and manage the installation common operating picture dur-ing responses to all installation incidents. 1.8.3.13.  Support of deploying of aircraft and personnel during wartime. 1.8.3.14.  Reception of evacuees/casualties from overseas theaters. 1.8.3.15.  Accomplishment of predisaster tasks to minimize lo ss of life and  facility damage inanticipation of enemy attack. 1.8.3.16.  Recovery, search and rescue, decontamination and personal support services. 1.8.3.17.  Assistance to civilian authorities for Civil Defense actions when resources are available,or as directed by higher authorities. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008331.8.3.18.  Minimum operations  and maintenance support of missi on essential facilities, utilities,and airfields. 1.8.3.19.  Support of tenant's wartime essential requirements. 1.8.3.20.  Support of forces staged in preparation for deployment. 1.8.3.21.  ARFF and structural fire protection. 1.9.  Off-Base Support. Disasters are not limited to base boundaries and neither is the Air Force response.While the base mission has first priority, the Air Force does not ignore the needs of its civilian neighbors.Historically the Air Force has been  a good neighbor and provided much needed assistance when civilresources were overcome by disaster. 1.9.1.  There are numerous examples of this assistance: December 1955 and February 1986, Beale AirForce Base helped the local communities following catastrophic flooding in the Marysville and YubaCity communities. In March of 1964, Elmendorf Air Force Base assisted the city of Anchorage in theaftermath of the devastating Alaskan earthquake. August 1969 saw personnel from Keesler Air ForceBase rapidly responded to calls for aid from Gulf Coast communities struck by Hurricane Camille. InApril 1982, a Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) team from Carswell Air Force Base wasinstrumental in reconstruction efforts after a tornado ripped through the town of Paris, T exas. Over-seas in November 1980, Air Force personnel supported rescue and recovery efforts in Avellino Prov-ince after the southern Italy earthquake. This history of support continues even today. 1.9.2.  There are numerous ways  that Air Force personnel, equipm ent, and materials may becomeinvolved in providing assistance during civilian emergencies. Under the Homeland Security Act of2002, the Secretary of Homeland Security is designated the “principal Federal official” for domesticincident management and is respons ible for coordinating Federal re sources used in response to orrecovery from terrorist attacks, major disasters or other emergencies. Specific Air Force roles andresponsibilities are established in Air Force Policy Di rective (AFPD) 10-8, Homeland Defense andCivil Support, and further described in AFI 10-802, Military Support to  Civil Authorities. Air Forceresources can also be committed without prior coordination if the local installation commander deemsit necessary to save lives, preven t human suffering, or mitigate great property damage. Reciprocalagreements between military and civil fire departments and agreements between explosive ordnancedisposal teams and local civil  authorities are other ways that  Air Force resources may becomeinvolved in off-base emergencies. At overseas locations, Air Force resources are normally committedwithin the context of US and host government agreements. 1.9.3.  Always keep Air Force support  to civilian communities in perspective. Local civil authoritiesare responsible for leading the response to disasters in civilian communities. The Air Force can play asupport role, but does not  take over. The Air Force  only assists when asked  by local authorities, butproper approval must be coordinated through the appropriate command level prior to providing sup-port. Usually, that assistance is only provided if  it will not take away from support of the base mis-sion—however, the Secretary of Defense can direct otherwise. The authoritative guidance on AirForce support to civil authorities is found in AFI 10-802. 1.10.  The Need for Planning. The need for predisaster and preattack planning should already be obvious.Why then so many words on this topic? Quite simp ly: to emphasize the nee d. Individuals usually knowthey should make plans, but too often do not get around to it. They have good intentions, but they procras-34AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008tinate. Some, however, do not even see the need to plan. They believe they are smart enough to decidewhat to do on the spot. In other cases, they fail to  plan because they do not recognize a potential crisis.Even worse, a few refuse to think  about a potential disaster because the  cost to reduce the risk is "toomuch". No matter the reason, the consequences—and costs—for failing to plan can be staggering. 1.10.1.  Experimental Evidence. The results of an interesting study by psychologist Alexander Mintzhelp make the case for the value of planning. His study clearly showed the wide difference betweenplanned and unplanned responses in a period of stress. His tests involved 42 experiments with 15 to 21subjects. Experimental situations consisted of a large glass bottle with a narrow mouth into which hadbeen inserted a number of aluminum cones. These cones were attached to strings each of which washeld by one of the participants in the study. The idea was for each person to pull his or her cone out ofthe bottle. When emergency conditions were simulated, there was an “every man for himself” attitudeand traffic jams resulted. Sometimes only one or two cones were jerked free before the rest were hope-lessly snarled. As the experiment progressed, participants were given time for prior consultation andplanning. This prior planning elim inated traffic jams and, in one  case, all cones were removed inunder 10 seconds. This simple experiment dramatically demonstrates what happens when there are noplans for possible disasters. Cones get jammed, and strings get twisted. The real life results are muchmore devastating—personnel are killed and injured;  resources are destroyed; minor emer genciesbecome major disasters. 1.10.2.  Planning Versus Panic. After the ship T itanic hit an iceberg, Mrs. Dickinson Bishop left$11,000 in jewelry behind in her stateroom, but asked her husband to run back to pick up a forgottenmuff. Another passenger grabbed three oranges and a good luck pin, overlooking $300,000 in securi-ties he had in his cabin. Still another passenger carried nothing but a musical toy pig into the lifeboat.There are numerous cases of people  who, in their haste to escape hot el fires, jump from upper floorwindows located just a few feet from a fire escape. Panic causes such strange and illogical behavior,and it can undermine effective disaster response. While planning, preparation, and training may noteliminate panic, they certainly can reduce its effects. 1.10.3.  No Disaster Plan. An example of a disaster that could have been averted with proper planningoccurred in Galveston Bay in 1947.  It all began with a few wisps of  smoke from a cargo of fertilizercarried on board the French ship SS Grandcamp. A crewman investigated, but even after shifting sev-eral bags of fertilizer, he could find no evidence of flame. He tried throwing several buckets of waterin the direction of the smoke, with no effect. Next he tried a fire extinguisher. Still there was no effect.So he called for a fire  hose. The foreman objected, since hosing down the cargo would ruin it. Thecaptain was informed and he ordered that the hatches be battened down and the steam jets turned on.Turning on steam to fight fires is standard marine firefighting practice and has been used for manyyears. But this cargo of fertilizer was ammonium nitrate which becomes a high explosive when heatedto about 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 1.10.3.1.  Someone should have known how to deal with this explosive fertilizer. Someone shouldhave made plans for putting out a possible fire in or near ammonium nitrate. But no one had donethe necessary planning. So, at 0912 on  the morning of April 16, 1947, the 10,419 ton SS Grand-camp and all those aboard were blown to bits. The explosion, calculated as equivalent to 1.25 kilo-tons of dynamite, dropped 3 00-pound pieces of the Grandcamp three miles away. The blastflattened surrounding oil refineries and chemical pl ants and set off fires and explosions to othe rnitrate-filled ships, grain warehouses and chemical storage tanks in the port of Texas City (Figure1.21.). The accident destroyed one third of the homes in the town of 16,000 and killed at least 576AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200835people. Additionally, the first explosion killed 26 firefighters and de stroyed all of the city’s fire-fighting equipment, leaving the city helpless in  the wake of subsequent explosions. Property losswas estimated at $67 million. Figure 1.21.  Explosion of the SS Grand Camp, Texas City, Texas 1947. 1.10.3.2.  As a result of this explosion, and the subsequent more violent blasts, Texas City becamea scene of chaos. Altho ugh local agencies and citi zens of the city worked valiantly to help theinjured and reduce property damage, for the first few hours, their work was uncoordinated. Therewas no adequate plan for disaster. 1.10.3.3.  The head of the city’ s disaster organization stated that they had plans for protectionagainst a hurricane, but not for an emergency that came without warning like this massive explo-sion. In fact, in a meeting to expand the disaster organization’s function just three weeks before theexplosion, individuals had scoffed at the idea. 1.10.4.  An Effective Disaster Plan. An exploding ammunition ship presented South Amboy, NJ, witha similar situation as Texas City, but the New Jersey community had a  disaster plan all set to go intooperation. The community response force immediately  executed the plan and shifted into high gear .Personnel knew where they were supposed to go a nd quickly responded to their assignments. Fire-fighters were available to control blazes and prevent further explosions. Roadblocks were establishedto keep curious sightseers out and provide clear access routes for critical supplies. Effective commu-nications and liaison channels we re established between the involv ed agencies, as outlined in thedisaster plan. Although property loss was great, lo ss of life was reduced and the emer gency wasbrought under control much sooner than the T exas City disaster. The examples in this section coverpeacetime disasters, but there is no less of a need to plan for the contingencies of war. 1.11.  Summary. Crises can cover a wide range of very different situations. They may be highly localized,like a tornado or terrorist attack,  or they may impact a large area, like a hurrican e or nuclear attack.Regardless of how different each emergency may be, they have several traits in common. Almost all cri-ses are very unpredictable and requi re prompt action if lives are to  be saved and essential servicesrestored. The descriptions of natural disasters, man made disasters, and hostile-actions provide an idea of36AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008the environments in which civil en gineers must operate following an emergency. The discussion on theAir Force involvement in cr ises and the associated civil engineer's role sets the stage for more detaileddiscussions on CE contingency response planning. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200837Chapter 2  MAKING PLANS 2.1.  Introduction. Experience and history have shown that actions take n during an emergency, contin-gency, and disaster response and recovery actions are much more ef fective if planned. Plans help engi-neers respond to crises and minimize the time it takes to organize and begin recovery actions. The longerit takes CE units to react effectively—the potential for loss of life and USAF resources is increased. Planshelp focus our efforts so we do the  right things quickly and the most  important things first. When morethan one person is involved, plans he lp sort out who does wh at and when. Plans, operating instructions,and checklists are commonly consider ed the products of planning. When  preparing plans, never for getthat personnel—organized, equipped, and trained to respond to a variety of contingencies—are the mostimportant “product” of planning. This chapter outlines a number of plans that CE is the author, owner orpart of the development team. All plans should cover some very basic areas: 2.1.1.  Plans should clearly designate a chain of command, roles, and responsibilities of each level ofcommand, and how authority is transferred (i.e., at what point does the Incident Commander officiallytransfer incident command on-scene). 2.1.2.  Notification list for various responses. 2.1.3.  Specific training and exer cise requirements for teams respons ible for actions outlined in theplan. 2.2.  Overview. This chapter discusses contingency pla nning activities that civil engineers can expect toperform at base level. It  lists preparations civil engineers should plan for before a crisis threatens; listssome of the capabilities needed to respond following a disaster, and also provides brief descriptions of themajor plans which civil engineers must  prepare or contribute to. In each case, the reader is referred tosources where he or she can find information to help prepare those plans. This chapter presents additionalguidance on the preparation of the CE Contingency Response Plan as well as a discussion of the supportcivil engineers get and give to othe r base units. Formal and informal ag reements that impact civil engi-neers are briefly discussed as are environmental pr otection considerations in contingency planning. Thechapter touches on the need and value of checklists, discusses whose job it is to plan, and provides hintson preparing the plans. 2.3.  Major Planning Efforts. Crises—major accidents, hostile actions, and natural disasters—are unpre-dictable and full of the unexpected. This unpredictability dictates that a base reduce its vulnerability anddevelop flexible responses in adva nce to ensure Air Force operations continue during war and after adisaster. Because of their significant roles in first and emergency response, and post-attack/post-incidentbase recovery, civil engineers are heavily involved in advance planning. This chapter outlines the contin-gency planning civil engineers are most often called on to do at bas e level and identifies sources toretrieve additional information for developing plans. The focal point for CE-related contingency planningis typically the Readiness and Emer gency Management Flight with heavy involvement from Fire Emer-gency Services (FES), Operations, and EOD flights. 2.3.1.  The four tables that follow contain generic lists that may help stimulate thinking on what tasksand capabilities are required to be  considered during planning efforts. Table 2.1. outlines predisasterpreparations; Table 2.2. highlights postdisaster CE response capabilities; Table 2.3. lists preattack38AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008preparations; and Table 2.4. presents postattack capabilities. Do not rely solely on these tables; other-wise, important preparations or  capabilities may be overlooked. To further assist, the tables identifysource documents to find more information on each topic. There are other useful reference materialson many of the topics, but start with these sources.

While the CE unit may not be the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for all of the items inthe aforementioned tables, CE does have a unit responsibility for each one. This planning is necessaryfor an effective CE response, and the results should be included in the CE Contingency Response Planand associated checklists. 2.3.3.  Planning for any response must automatically include provisions for the personnel/teams, lead-ership, equipment, vehicles, supplies, and communications needed to perform the task. It should alsoinclude provisions for training and required support from others. 2.4.  Formal Plans. Considering the Air Force’s worldwide commitment, it should come as no surprisethat there are a plethora of Air Force plans. It is not uncommon for a base to  prepare more than a dozenplans and to support another dozen or so. Unfortunately, there is not a standard list of plans. Major com-mand (MAJCOM) planning requirements are not identical since the  commands have different missionsand geographical areas of responsibility. There are even differences between bases within a command.Consequently, it is not always easy to find the specific guidance desired. This section provides assistancewith the planning process by highlighting the plans that civil engineers commonly contribute to, prepare,or use. These plans may not be re quired for all locations; however, there may be required plans that arenot listed. At major bases, the BCE is often tasked to develop separate civil engineer annexes or an appen-dix to base plans. These annexes or appendices should briefly describe the support civil engineers provideto satisfy the plans and the support CE requires fro m the other base or ganizations. Such annexes andappendices are usually supported by  more detailed information in th e CE Contingency Response Plan.Always contact the base OPR and refer to source documents on each plan for preparation guidelines andformat. The Wing Plans office often prints a synopsis of plans that apply to the wing. MAJCOM war plansare listed in the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), volume 2. 2.4.1.  Wing Operations Plans. Each wing prepares operations plans (OPLAN) to show how the wingwill execute its taskings in s upport of MAJCOM OPLANs. Genera lly, but not exclusively, wingOPLANs cover wartime taskings. OPLANs detail how the wing will fight in support of MAJCOM orair component command OPLANs. This is mentioned to distinguish these plans from a base supportplan which outlines preparations which the wing must ta ke before hostilities and what actions mustoccur after hostilities to “keep the jets flying” while executing an OPLAN. The Wing Plans office isthe OPR for preparing war fighting OPLANs. AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, Planning Formats andGuidance, and MAJCOM/air component command OPLANs are th e source documents for wingOPLANs. 2.4.2.  Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2. At any USAF base, the CEMP10-2 is the "master" plan for base  level emergency response to physical threats resulting from majoraccidents; natural disasters; enemy attack or terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclearor high-yield explosives (CBRNE). This plan outlines actions and assigns responsibilities to agenciesrequired to cope with catastrophe s caused by the incidents menti oned above—especially those thatinvolve nuclear or other hazardous material. This can be a very useful and versatile document. A plan-ner can add appendices to the annexes to cover almost any disaster. A few other plans are often incor-porated in this way. Civil engineers are responsible for preparing this plan, but it requires the input ofmany other organizations on base. This plan helps provide the basis on which to build the CE Contin-gency Response Plan. The directing document for  the CEMP 10-2 is AFI  10-2501, Air Force Emer-gency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. This publication lays out the basicrequirements; however, the MAJCOM may provide additional details. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008432.4.3.  CE Contingency Response Plan. This plan should provide detailed guidelines, information, anddirection to help CE personnel to respond to crises. This plan should provide CE-specific guidance forsupporting implementation of the base’s CEMP 10-2 and other base level plan s. Preparing this planrequires a major effort by the CE unit. A contingency response plan is not required for each separateoperating site at a base. Separate  appendices or paragraphs within the CE plan are usually adequate.At a small base, a remote site or an Air Force station, CE support responsibilities may be described inpertinent paragraphs of the CE MP 10-2. MAJCOMs ensure CE con tingency response plans are pre-pared for USAF-controlled bases with contracted civil engineer functions. The directive for this planis AFI 10-211, Civil Engineer Contingency Response Planning. 2.4.4.  In-garrison Expeditionary Support Plan (IGESP). This is an omnibus plan (formerly known asBase Support Plan) that identifies base level actions required to support MAJCOM operations plans orcontingencies of any kind. An IGESP is usually written to get a base and its units ready for war, but itis also used to support military operations other than war, such as humanitarian relief. Often this planfocuses on force beddown and accommodating transient aircraft, units, and personnel. Its purpose is tointegrate all base support requirements. MAJCOMs  may permit consolidation of all base-level sup-porting plans into the IGESP, including the installation CEMP 10-2. Total consolidation can create anunwieldy plan, so to avoid duplication the IGESP may refer to other base plans. Each MAJCOM setsthe plan format within their co mmand. This is a major plan whic h civil engineer planners shouldreview. CE directly contributes to many of the annexes: CBRNE defense operations; airbase operabil-ity; EOD support; base reception; base maps; facility utilization; temporary facility plans. Engineersalso provide inputs to annexes in the plan written by other units. The master source document is AFI10-404, Base Support and  Expeditionary Site Planning. In addition, refer to the plans which theIGESP supports. The Logistics plans shop normally le ads development of this plan. IGESP require-ments are included in the Joint Support Plan for a collocated operating base (COB). 2.4.5.  Base Reception Plan. When operations plans  call for the addition of forces to a USAF-con-trolled base, there is a need for a reception plan to effectively and efficiently receive incoming forcesby ensuring arriving personnel are provided immedi ate protection from the ef fects of enemy attack,adequate living and working facilities; and arranging for the expeditious movement of arriving equip-ment to unit work areas. Civil engineers help bed  those forces down; but even before that, engineershelp determine if existing facilities can accommodate the additive forces or if temporary facilities arerequired. To do that, engineers need to know how many and what types of units will be arriving, whenthey will be arriving, when they will be leaving if the base  is serving a through-put base, and wherethey need to work on  base. The location of any  temporary facilities and utility systems can then bedetermined and beddown plans prepared. This plan is normally an annex to the IGESP. 2.4.6.  Civil Engineer Support Plan (CESP). The CESP  is not a stand-alone plan. When used, it is anappendix to the logistics annex, or separate annex, of unified command war plans and is not normallyincluded in Air Force p lans. The CESP identifies the minimum essential e ngineering services andconstruction requirements required to support the commitment of milita ry forces. Extract the base'srequirements from the unified plan  CESP to incorporate in the IG ESP. To those requirements, addlocal construction and facility requirements that the base will  satisfy. Explain how all requirementswill be satisfied and any preattack actions that must be taken by the base. 2.4.7.  Base Dispersal Plan. This plan is intended fo r overseas bases subject to attack. The plan pro-vides for relocating key assets to secure locations on and off the base. Provisions must be made to beable to easily recall the assets. This information may be a stand alone plan or included in the IGESP. 44AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20082.4.8.  Base Denial Plan. Overseas bases that could be attacked and overrun by an enemy force mustprepare a plan to deny the use of  facilities, supplies, and equipment to the enemy. The priorities andextent of denial will be decided by the commander ordering it, taking into account the potential valueof the assets to the enemy. Once the order has been given, the deni al of military equipment and sup-plies is the responsibility of the  using organization. Civil engineers have a big task destroying utilitysystems and pavements. A plan is needed to ensure  the more important items are denied first. At themany overseas locations not "owned " by the United S tates, denial planning is limited to denial ofUS-owned assets only. This plan is directed by theater OPLANs. The denial plan may be incorporatedinto the IGESP or a warfighting OPLAN. 2.4.9.  Joint Support Plan (JSP). If deploying to an overseas base operated by the host nation, read thejoint support plan for that base. The plan outlines, among other things, what part of the base and whatfacilities are available to deploying Air Force f orces. The plan also specifies  who is responsible forwhat tasks and who provides what support. Usually these plans are prepared by the theater MAJCOM(in USAFE by Regional Support Groups). If planning is tasked to an Air Force support base, the OPRfor this plan is usually the Logistics Plans office. In that case, the support Base Civil Engineer may betasked with providing inputs similar to those for a IG ESP. The JSP should also be available from thegaining theater MAJCOM Civil Engineer Readiness and Emergency Management Office. Copies mayalso be available, but probably in very limited numbers, from the reception team provided by the gain-ing command's sponsor base. 2.4.10.  Survival, Recovery, and Reconstitution Plan (SRR Plan 8044). This plan (formerly numberedthe SRR Plan 55) provides guidance to improve survivability of the strategic forces and to enhance therecovery and reconstitution of thos e forces in the event of a nuclear attack on Air Force bases thathave strategic weapon systems. As with all war plans, ci vil engineers are tasked with providing thefacilities, utilities and services needed to support the base mission. If called for in the plan, some of thecivil engineers may deploy with members of other ba se units to dispersal ba ses. If the main base isattacked and cannot support the mission, the deploy ed force is in a positio n to try to recover andreconstitute the strategic assets at undamaged di spersal bases. The deployed engineers provide asmuch wartime CE support—utility operations, damage assessment and repair , weapons safing,CBRNE monitoring, firefighting and  crash rescue, etc.—as they have capability. Because many dis-persal locations are at civilian  airfields, civil engineers may be  able to get support from civilresources. That support often requires prior agreements. Only bases  with a SRR tasking prepare thisplan. The Wing Plans office normally leads the base level planning for the SRR plan. The US Strate-gic Command Directive 8044 and th e MAJCOM’s supporting plan are the source documents for thebase-level plan. 2.4.11.  Installation Security Plan. This plan outlin es responses the base s hould take when priorityassets are threatened. In peacetime, the primary threat is terrorist  activities; other scenarios includeriot, civil disturbance, sniper, and hostage situations. Civil engineers are called on to support this planin many ways such as EOD troops to safe a bomb, firefighters to provide Fire trucks as a psychologi-cal deterrent, and heavy equipment to block access to  priority resources. Critical facilities may alsorequire hardening, traffic barriers constructed, and fences and alarm systems installed and repaired.The Security Forces unit is the OPR for this pl an and the source documen t is AFI 31-101, The AirForce Installation Security Program (FOUO). 2.4.12.  Resource Protection Plan. Simila r in purpose to the Installation  Security Plan, this plan pro-vides for protection of non-priority assets and CE support is essentially the same. At bases with prior-AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200845ity assets, the provisions of this plan are often incorporated into the Installation Security Plan. Underthis plan, all base units including civil engineers should make provisions to protect unit assets (equip-ment, vehicles, supplies, etc.). Civil engineers need to make sure  key features of the base utility sys-tems are not easy targets such as transformer stations, wells, water treatment facilities, pump houses,etc. Instructions for this plan come from AFI 31-101. 2.4.13.  Base Defense  Plan. The terrorist attacks of 1 1 September 2001 highlighted the fact that allUSAF bases, CONUS or  OCONUS, are subject to a potential  threat and should prepare a BaseDefense Plan. Although this is usually overseen by  security forces or OS I, civil engineers may betasked to provide construction expertise, counter mobility barrier erection and augmentation man-power for the base defense force. CE should strive to have active representation on the Base DefensePlanning Group as it can result in significant tasking for the CE squadron. The directing document isAFI 31-301, Air Base Defense. 2.4.14.  Stop Alert Plan. Every base with aircraft  has a Stop Alert Plan. It dictates how the baseresponds to prevent unauthorized movement, theft or  hijacking of aircraft. It also outlines how thebase may assist aircrews of hijacked aircraft from  other locations. The civil engineer role is usuallylimited to support from FE S to use their vehicles to block the  movement of the aircraft and EOD tocounter any explosive devices that the highjacker may use. The lead for this pl an is the OperationsSupport Squadron. Their basic guid ance comes from AFI 13-207, Prev enting and Resisting AircraftPiracy (Hijacking). 2.4.15.  Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Emergency Planning and Response Plan. AFI 10-2501 andAFMAN 32-4013, Hazardous Material Emergency Planning and Response Guide, requires installa-tions to prepare a plan that outlines how the base  responds to the spill of hazardous materials, otherthan nuclear and explosives. Whil e the base civil engineer is re sponsible for the HAZMAT plan, itrequires the active support of many base organizations. Rather than a stand-alone plan, it can be incor-porated as an appendix in  the CEMP 10-2. At overs eas installations, the guiding document for thisplan is AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program in Foreign Countries. This plan will be familiar to somepersonnel by its previous title, the Base Spill Prevention and Response Plan. 2.4.16.  Energy Contingency Plan. Also called the Energy Security Plan, this plan is developed toensure electrical power remains av ailable to priority mission users during and following a disaster .Many direct mission support functions on an airbase, such as aircraft maintenance and air traffic con-trol, are dependent on electrical  power; civil engineers have the j ob to supply it. This CE preparedplan outlines methods to protect the power system , to establish independent sources, and to providepower, including emergency backup, on a mission priority basis. The  details of this plan are oftenincluded in the CE Contingency Response Plan. The source document for this plan is AFI 10-211. 2.4.17.  Base Deployment Plan/Wing Mobility Plan. For bases and units with a mobility commitment,a deployment plan (sometimes called the wing mobility plan) is prepared to detail the responsibilitiesof getting base units ready to deploy. Base units, including the CE Prime BEEF teams; usually prepareattachments to the base/wing plan that are called mobility operating procedures or deployment proce-dures. Those procedures and associated checklists specify who goes, what to take, where to assemble,what to brief, who doe s what, etc. Rapid Engin eer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair SquadronEngineer (RED HORSE) squadrons develop their own plans, procedures, and checklists. Units wil lnormally deploy as part of a Multiple UTC Group (MUG). The unit may be either Lead or Follow-on.Ensure compliance with the requirements in AF I 10-401 concerning MUG  responsibilities. Genericinformation for deployment and mobility planning can also be found in AFI 10-403, Deployment46AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Planning and Execution. MAJCOM and base supplements are common. Additional information forCE Prime BEEF teams is contai ned in AFI 10-210, Prime Base E ngineer Emergency Force (BEEF)Program, AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Program, the Prime BEEF Implementation andPlanning Guide, and the Prime  BEEF Equipment and Supplies Listings (ESL). RED HORSE guid-ance can be found in AFI 10-209, RED HORSE Program. RED HORSE deployment and employmentinformation is also contained in the RED HORSE Concept of Operations. 2.4.18.  Emergency Action Procedures (EAP). This is a classified document. Each level of command,including HQ USAF, delineates specific time-sensitive actions which subordinate commands are totake to prepare for war. These actions are usually packaged in the  form of checklists. The specificactions vary with the level of the threat (alert condition). The actions and the method of communicat-ing which actions are to be taken are called the Emergency Action Procedures (some commands mayuse a different term, but the product is essentially the same; e.g., HQ USAFE uses Emergency ActionFile). Subordinate units are directed to tailor the EAP and make unit specific checklists to implementthe EAP taskings. CE EAP checklists can easily be included in Annex X of the contingency responseplan. The wing EAP should be  available within the civil engineer  unit at a base; if not, contact theWing Plans office. 2.4.19.  Anti-Terrorism Plan. Commanders, down to  installation and GSU level, will develop andimplement an antiterrorism (AT) plan. Commanders may use a stand-alone plan or include A Tannexes in their existing force protection plan.  Guidelines on AT planning are found in AF MAN10-401, Volumes 1 & 2. S tand-alone documents (i.e., Standard Operating Procedures, local regula-tions, or Operations Orders that  articulate requirements for AT key elements) shall be replicated inand/or referenced in the AT Plan. Task appropriate level units for support, ensuring all organic, tenantand supported units are considered, and receive copies of the plans. See AFI 10-245, Air Force Anti-terrorism (AT) Standards, for minimum key elements the plan shall address. 2.4.20.  Medical Contingency Res ponse Plan (MCRP). The MCRP/EOP  establishes procedures forwartime, humanitarian assistance, homeland security /defense, and disaster response contingencies.The MCRP describes medical responses to contingency scenarios, clearly addressing planning aspectsof mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Additionally, a Hazardous Vulnerability Analysiswill be included. Refer to AFI 41-106, Medical R eadiness Planning and Training, for more informa-tion on the MCRP. 2.4.21.  Disease Containment Pl an. The installation commander w ill establish an installation-widedisease containment plan (DCP) incorporating tenant units, geographically separated units, civilians,dependents, and visitors (where applicable) to  ensure the installation can effectively respond, miti-gate, and recover from disease outbreaks as a result of biological terrorism/warfare or from naturallyoccurring diseases of operational significance.  See AFI 10-2604, Diseas e Containment PlanningGuidance, for more information on the DCP. 2.5.  CE Contingency Response Plan Guidance. This pa ragraph offers a few thoughts on preparing andpackaging the contingency response plan. It contains information on plan content and format, supple-menting the guidance contained in AFI 10-211. Use the standard Air Force OPLAN format  which isdivided into two parts: the basic  plan and its supporting annexes. Th at format can be found in AFMAN10-401, Volume 2. The guidelines on formatting contingency response plans can be found in Attachment2 of this pamphlet. Bases located in overseas theaters will incorporate the Base Attack Recovery conceptof operation in CE contingency plans. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008472.5.1.  The Basic Plan. The basic plan contains seve n sections: references, task or ganizations, situa-tion, mission, execution, administration and logistics, and command and signal. When writing or edit-ing the base plan, keep it brief—save the details for the annexes. 2.5.2.  Supporting Annexes. AFI 10-211 delineates the annexes which must be used for all CE contin-gency response plans written by Air Force civil engineers. The preparation of a comprehensive set ofannexes will require the majority of effort devoted to plan development. 2.5.3.  Relationship to Ot her Base Plans. An effective contingency response plan consolidates CEtaskings that are specified in the various base plans, and it expands on those taskings with additionaldetails. The contingency response plan should be organized so it is easy to identify initial actions thatcivil engineers must take in a contingency. Figure 2.1. shows where in the contingency response planto incorporate and expand on task ings from other base plans. The  solid lines show the annexes thatcontain the details for support of the various plans. This recommended approach is offered to promotecommonality between Contingency response plans. There are ma ny possible variations, but be surevariations are necessary and “make sense.” The example does not include a complete list of possibleplans. Incorporate these and other plans in the annexes as appropriate to the base. 2.6.  Support To and From Others. Pl ans should document the support civil engineers provide to othersand the support received in return. Much of that support is obvious and is done routinely every day. Thisparagraph focuses on a few not so  common tasks. This listing is a me mory jogger to ensure these pointsare covered during the plan ning process. Some of th ese items apply more often to overseas Air Forceinstallations, but not exclusively. Be sure to coordi nate the support required  with the supporting unit inadvance. That support should also be documented in the CEMP 10-2 or IGESP. 48AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure 2.1.  CE Contingency Response Plan Relationship to Other Base Plans. 2.6.1.  Mortuary Officer. Few contingencies or disasters would likely cause great loss of life on an air-base, but war is one. While the li kelihood of a major attack on US ai rbases has diminished, the basemortuary officer (usually the services squadron commander) must still plan for processing and bury-AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200849ing human remains when the numbers of deaths exceed the base's capability to store the remains or toship them home quickly. The Base Civil Engineer should help the mortuary officer pre-identify buriallocations. Make sure the  burial sites do not create an environmen tal problem or interfere with otheruses for the proposed sites. If interment is requi red, civil engineers can fu rther help by providingequipment and operators to help  dig and close the graves. EOD assists during the processing ofremains by removing any explosive hazards/residue contained in the remains. 2.6.2.  Tactical Deception Officer (TDO). The TDO works for the Operations Group Commander andhas the job of developing plans to deceive the enemy about the us e of base aircraft. This can involvebase activities, the physical concealment of facilities, and deceptive use of facilities. Many other unitsmay be involved to include civil e ngineers. Specific actions vary with the situation. Possible actionsthat engineers and others may take are presented in volume 2 of this pamphlet series. 2.6.3.  Medical Group. Base medical  services personnel are responsible for identifying medical andpublic health problems and for recommending corrective actions. This includes contingency responseoperations. Good teamwork can prevent a minor health problem from becoming a major impact to thebase's mission. Specific responsibilities of the medical unit, as iden tified in AFI 41-106 include thefollowing actions: 2.6.3.1.  Provide professional and t echnical guidelines to DRF personnel and mobility personnelon the medical aspects of both peacetime and wartime contingency operations. 2.6.3.2.  Provide technical policy to installati on commanders on protection and operations inCBRN environments. 2.6.3.3.  Detect, identify, and monitor CBRN conditions on inst allations and medical treatmentfacilities and medical units. 2.6.3.4.  Conduct food and water vulnerability studies for employment sites and fixed installationsoverseas. 2.6.3.5.  Ensure that applica ble preventive medicine guidance is pr ovided to unit personnel fordeployments and exercises. 2.6.3.6.  Verify that pre-deployment medical  screening and immunization requirements fordeploying personnel are identified and completed. 2.6.3.7.  Provide self-aid and buddy care training to designated unit trainers. 2.6.4.  Vehicle Maintenance. In addition to the normal in-shop suppor t, arrange for mobile mainte-nance and repairs, especially for the heavy equipment. To facilitate this support, attempt to supportthem when they need help (e.g., provide them with a generator during a base power outage). Not onlywill it allow them to support the base and look good in the process, it will also help ensure CE vehiclesget repaired. In a contingency, contract maintenance is a possibility. 2.6.5.  Base Fuels. An agreement with this shop to get heavy construction vehicles fueled in the fieldis most helpful. Field refueling can save a lot of time and problems. If they cannot help, look into set-ting up a CE refueling operation; this also applies to refueling emergency generators. 2.6.6.  Base Supply. Special levels help ensure the critical, but little used and items that are not readilyavailable from local suppliers are  available for facility and utility  system repairs when needed. Itrequires an enormous amount of funds to maintain special levels; therefore, base supply works hard tokeep those levels to a minimum. A good working relationship with base supply can help make sure the50AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008items required are stocked. There is no one-time soluti on to this issue; the relationship must be rou-tinely nurtured by working together and not blaming each other when needed supplies fail to show up. 2.6.7.  Contracting. A good working re lationship is required with c ontracting personnel in order toobtain supplies and equipment from local sources in a hurry. Just as important, cooperation from basesupply and the base comptroller is required to ensure the paperwork gets to contracting quickly. 2.6.8.  Aircraft Maintenance. Aircraft maintenan ce units have equipment th at can prove useful intimes of recovery. One of the most useful items, especially during night operations, is light carts; theyusually have more than any unit on base. They also have air compressors and portable air conditionersand heaters that may be useful. Ob tain the contact information of  the lowest ranking person that hasauthority to release the assets. When requesting support, demonstrate how their cooperation will ben-efit the mission, because they most likely will have to divert equipment from one of their maintenanceactivities and live with the consequences. 2.7.  Formal and Informal Agreements. Formal agreements are sometimes required to “guarantee” supportcalled for in base plans. Such  agreements are usually prepared when support crosses MAJCOM lines, isfrom one country to another, or is between military and civilian authorities. An effective agreement spec-ifies what support will be provided, by whom, under what conditions, and who will pay for what. 2.7.1.  As a CE planner, know what base agreements are in place, how they are implemented, and howthey can be adjusted or renegotiated. Determine if additional agreements would be helpful and worththe effort to develop. Agreements are especially important when support is required from uncoopera-tive organizations. 2.7.2.  The names of the formal agreements someti mes change, but the purpose remains the same. Ifthe agreement name is unfamiliar, ask what it is and if CE has a role. The Logistics Plans office is thebase OPR for these agreements in almost every case. Whenever in doubt, start with them. 2.7.3.  The following is a brief review of common agreements which can impact civil engineers: 2.7.3.1.  Host Nation Support (HNS) Agreement. The term memorandum of understanding(MOU) is used interchangeably with HNS Agreement. This is a high level agreement between twocountries. Rarely are base level organizations involved; however, bases may be the beneficiaries.For that reason, know what support, if any, is provided for the base or deployment location by suchagreements. Some bases have received assured HNS for airfield damage  repair (ADR) and forsupplies through this type of agreement. If the Logistics Plans office does not have the answer, askthe MAJCOM counterpart if there are any such agreements that affect the base. Details that affectunits deploying to a host nation installation can be found in the Joint Support Plan. 2.7.3.2.  Joint Support Plan (JSP). This plan is a formal agreement between the host nation instal-lation commander, the USAF commander who will use the facilities, and the USAF support basecommander. It implements more general country -to-country agreements. Consequently, it willprobably not be easy to alter the agreement, nor will it be done quickly. The terms and conditionsin Joint Support Plans differ by country and by base. Guidance for this plan is theater specific. 2.7.3.3.  Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) and Mutual Aid Agreements. These agree-ments are those activities and  measures taken by DOD  Components to foster mutual assistanceand support between the Department of Defense and any civil government agency in planning,preparing for, or applying military forces a nd resources in response  to, civil emergencies orattacks, including national security emer gencies. As the name implies, they set up arrangeme ntsAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200851where organizations with like capabilities can support each other when called upon in an emer-gency. Fire and Emergency Services, security forces, and the medical group often enter into theseagreements with their off-base counterparts. A major advantage to these agreements is the speedin which support can be initiated. Usually only a phone call from  one organization to the other isneeded. Agreements are not limit ed to those three fu nctions; arrangements for other activities,such as environmental hazard re sponse, can also be secured.  While wartime support is notexcluded, these agreements will most often be  invoked for peacetime emergencies. The guidingdocument for these agreements is AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures. 2.7.3.4.  Host-Tenant Support Agreements (HTSA). These agreements detail the relationshipbetween a host base and tenant units. The agreement specifies what support the host base providesto a tenant organization and the responsibilities of the tenant. Because this is a routine peacetimeagreement, there is not usually much in it that applies to emergency situations other than the disas-ter responses that a base provides anyway (e.g.,  FES). Occasionally, however, there are units onbase that have special capabilities that can be used in a disaster. Two examples are: a mobile com-munications installation unit has special purpose equipment which can assist in base recoverytasks: trenchers, backhoes, line trucks, etc; and a mobile air combat control unit may have portablegenerators that could be made  available. Because of their mobility commitment, these units maynot be available for every disaster, but attempt to get their agreement to participate when they areavailable. This agreement is the way to doc ument their commitment. The authorizing documentfor the host-tenant support agreement is AFI 25-201. 2.7.3.5.  Interservice Support Agreement (ISSA). Nearby military installations have capabilities torespond to disasters. Find out what they can a nd are willing to provide. Let them know what CEcan do. Document the proposed support with an inter-service support agreement. In some cases, amutual aid agreement does the same thing. Rememb er that the Logistics Plans of fice is the OPRfor any agreement. Often, these agreements must be approved by the MAJCOM. 2.7.3.6.  Inter-Departmental Service Agreement. Occasionally other federal agencies in the areahave capabilities that can he lp the base handle an emer gency. If not already pr ovided for in amutual aid agreement, an inter-departmental service agreement can be prepared to formalize anyagreement the base can reach with the other agency. Count on additional preparation time, becausethis agreement must be approved above base level. 2.7.3.7.  Informal Agreements. Informal agreements are probably the most  useful in obtainingemergency response support and are also the most  common. They are quicker to produce, and anod of the head or a handshake is enough to seal an agreement. Certainly, the value of such agree-ments depends on the personality and integrity of the participants. True, informal agreements areeasier to break than a formal agreement. But in  most cases, except possibly with a foreign host,they probably achieve the same results (foreign hosts may be willing, but they are often severelylimited as to what they can do without gettin g approval from higher headquarters). The majordrawback of informal agreements is that they do not usually have longevity. When the individualswho make the agreements leave, it is a dead issue unless their successors continue to embrace theagreement. Be sure informal agreements with outside DOD agencies are not in violation of law bycoordinating agreements with the base legal office. 52AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20082.8.  Environmental Protection Considerations. Common sense suggests a base would not write environ-mental impact statements to wage war, respond to aircraft accidents, or put out fires. But that same com-mon sense should also indicate that environmental awareness is still important in those circumstances. 2.8.1.  War and disasters can create unexpected environmenta l problems. How CE responds canreduce the hazards, leave them unchanged, or increase them. In crises, CE may not have environmen-tally acceptable choices of action, but should at least understand the consequences of the choices. Donot use an emergency as an excuse to ignore environmental considerations. That is not smart. Poorchoices can affect the base immediately, such as allowing a toxic ch emical spill to get into the basedrinking water. As a minimum, civil engineer disaster response actions should not make an environ-mental problem bigger. 2.8.2.  In planning for disaster and postattack responses, be sure to cover two important environmentalconsiderations. First, be ready to deal with hazardous materials. Identify the different points on thebase where the runoff of such liquids can be contained. Ideally construct containment devices beforedisasters threaten. However, at most bases this is impractical, because there are so many places whererunoff leaves a base. By det ermining where most hazardous material s are stored or transported, CEcan construct containment structures in the few locations likely to do the most good. This prevents anyhazardous material from contaminating the base’s water sources and those of neighboring communi-ties. Second, also be prepared to handle hazardous or contaminated solid materials temporarily in war.Identify locations to bury those materials temporarily so that the locations do not interfere with otherbase activities. Select sites th at minimize ground water contamination from leaching action. Both ofthese actions should be covered in the HAZMAT Plan. 2.9.  Checklists. Once a plan is written  or updated, one final planning  task remains—and it may be themost useful one. The CE unit should prepare or revise supporting checklists. Generally, checklists shouldbe created for each operating instruction contained  in the CE contingency response plan. Checklistsshould also be prepared for all other CE contingency or emergency support not otherwise covered in thatplan. A good checklist summarizes the tasks specified in an operating instruction or plan; gives each task(and subtask) a number; identifies th e OPR (who will do the  task); and states when the task or subtaskshould be started and/or completed (be sure to clarify which). An execution checklist format can be sim-ple: Task Number (also number subtasks in this column); Task Description; OPR; and Timing (if needed). 2.9.1.  Prepare checklists for Emergency Operations Center (EOC) positions, unit or damage controlcenter (UCC or DCC) positions, fire alarm communication center (FACC) telecommunicator, CBRNcontrol center positions, shops, a nd response teams. It  is helpful to use th e same or similar taskdescriptions for checklists prepared at every level in the unit for the same threat or emergency. It helpscommunication when the DCC talks to a shop about a major accident response, for example, and bothhave similarly numbered checklists. The tasks are more  general at the control center level and moredetailed at the team/shop level. If an action does not  apply to a team or shop, that number is skippedin the shop checklist. Tasks can be further divided into subtasks. For subtasks, use the same task num-ber but add a letter or number su ffix (i.e., 2a, 2b, 2c, etc., or 2.1,  2.2, 2.3, etc). It is suggested thatchecklists are prepared in a format similar to Emergency Action Procedures. 2.9.2.  Checklists are only memory joggers that outli ne tasks to be performed by each CE DCC staffmember and by each CE recovery or response team for each likely response situation. They give focusto a team's efforts. They help a team to get m oving quickly on a recovery task versus spending valu-able time deciding what needs to  be done. Checklists are  especially helpful when tasks are not per-AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200853formed often. They are great for  pre-disaster preparations and can help keep complicated re coveryefforts on track. 2.9.3.  Checklist preparation involves more than one  person and each team l eader should write theirown. They can include as  much or as little detail as their  team members need. Checklists shouldinclude such points as the tasks to be done; who wi ll do each one; when each task must be started orcompleted; what equipment, tools, and vehicles should be used; and, if required, where the task is tobe done. Team leaders should provide copies to the  Readiness Flight whom ensures all requiredchecklists are written. The Readiness and Emergency Management Flight then provides current cop-ies for the CE DCC and in the EOC. Use local exercises to check the usefulness of the checklists andbenchmark the best to share up, down, and across the CE organization. 2.9.4.  Keep checklists current. Do not  wait for a plan to be  revised to update or improve checklists.Update them more frequently than the plans they support because of changes in points of contact, etc. 2.9.5.  Consider sizing checklists us ed outdoors to fit into BDU pocke ts and make them water resis-tant. Flight crew checklist binders (5 1/2" x 8 1/4") work well for this. 2.10.  Whose Job Is It To Plan? Every civil engineer unit must plan  for disasters and contingencies. Theplans for some units can be quite simple, for others they must be extensive. The number of plans and levelof detail included in each will vary with each unit based on mission and exposure to disasters, contingen-cies, and war. This chapter focuses on the planning done by  a civil engineer unit with base maintenanceresponsibilities. However, even CE units with only mobility commitments need to understand what plan-ning is required, so they can better s upport those plans when they deploy. Table 2.5. highlights some ofthe planning that CE units  are likely to perform or contribute towards based  on their location and basemaintenance responsibilities. 54AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Table 2.5.

Good local plans cannot be written at the Pentagon or MAJCOM headquarters and mailed outfor civil engineer units to put in to effect. Local plans must be made using sound engineering princi-ples, experience, and common sense. Traditionally, the Readiness and Emergency Management Flightdoes the CE planning, but in fact, many unit members have a role. 2.10.2.  Anyone who leads a CE response team should  participate and provide their inputs to eachplan. The CE commander has the option of choosing anyone in the unit to lead the planning effort forone or more of the plans. This helps spread out the workload and gets more personnel knowledgeablewith the unit response capabilities and requirements. 2.11.  Hints for Plan Development. This section offers some hints for preparing CE plans. 2.11.1.  The Process. The planning process is as important as the product. While gathering informationand developing solutions for the plans, much is  learned about the unit’s mission, capabilities, andshortfalls. The knowledge gained from ga thering information about the unit’s mission, capabilitiesand shortfalls, and developing solutions for the plans, makes the unit better able to respond to crises.The more individuals in the process, the more  knowledge expands throughout the unit and buildsdepth into the CE “team.” Plans and checklists only document the results of the process. 2.11.2.  Keep Plans Simple.  Good plans do not have to  be elaborate, but they  do have to be easy tounderstand. Generally, simple plans are better and are easier to follow and more likely to be success-ful. No plan can cover every co nceivable contingency, and experience shows that no crisis goesaccording to plan. Rely on the common sense and good judgment of the personnel to adapt to the sit-uation. The planning will be adequate if personnel are organized to respond to the crises, know whatto do, and have the resources to do it. 2.11.3.  Answer Key Questions. T he planning process is  essentially an effort to answer a few keyquestions. There are many ways to phrase the "who, what, when, where, why and how" questions. 2.11.3.1.  What does the plan’s OPR want from me? Know the purpose of the plan, what inputs theOPR expects, and what format to use. The OPR should be able to provide the basic plan or at leastan outline of the information from the standard five sections: situation, mission, execution, admin-istration and logistics, command and signals. 2.11.3.2.  What is the threat? What contingencies do engineers need to be prepared for? Identify allthe likely natural and man-made  threats to the base and its missi ons. Ideally, that informationshould be presented in the situation section of  the basic plan. If not available from the OPR,review chapter one of the basic pl an. It is a good place  to start, but contact the wing intelligenceoffice for terrorist and wartime threats. Threats change over time, so keep up to date. The baseweather office can provide useful data on weat her related emergencies. This should include thefrequency and magnitude of the natural threats. Provide the commander several proposals on whatthreats should be included. The commander can often offer valuable insights here. 2.11.3.3.  For each threat, what is  likely to be targeted/damaged and how important is that func-tion/facility to the mission? Identify the most probable targets and the most vulnerable functionsand facilities for each threat. Anticipate the impact on the mi ssion if those functions or facilitiesare damaged. 2.11.3.4.  What permanent or temporary solutions can be employed to reduce the vulnerability ofthe mission-critical functions and facilities? There will never be enough money to properly protect56AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008the key facilities identified on the Critical Facilities list established through the base contingencyplanning group. Efforts should be made to get the most protection for the available dollars. 2.11.3.5.  Based on the missi on, in what priority should the ba se respond to recovery tasks andfacility damage? This information should be updated as threats or missions change or as hardenedfacilities are built. 2.11.3.6.  What CE capabilities are required to respond to each disaster? 2.11.3.7.  What resources are needed for each response capability: personnel, equipment, vehicles,supplies, etc? What is availabl e? Determine resource shortfalls  and decide how to satisfy thoseshortfalls. 2.11.3.8.  Who in the unit will be responsible for what tasks and what support? Establish who is todo what, with what resources and, if possible, when they are to do it. 2.11.4.  Set Up A Planning Team. Many plans are the result of a few smart personnel thinking about aproblem and developing common sense solutions. Cert ainly, one person can prepare CE plans, butthat is not a formula for success; major advantages are gained by setting up a planning team. As statedearlier, getting more personnel invol ved in the planning process yiel ds a better-informed unit. Theadditional brainpower tends to yield more suggestions and better solutions—and a better plan. In addi-tion, when individuals feel they are part of the solu tion, they are more willing and better able to exe-cute the plan or provid e support for it. A part-time ad hoc te am works best. Team membership canchange with each plan. The team does not have to meet often. In fact the team members can meet withthe leader and each other only as needed to get guidance, coordinate efforts, and turn in their work. 2.11.5.  Take Advantage of the Experienced. Seek out personnel who have been at the base or in thearea for a long time and ask for their help. Some will freely share their thoughts and others may ask alot of questions. They will usually have a wealth of information and invariably reveal overlooked, butimportant, facts. 2.11.6.  The Planning Leader’s Job. The planning leader guides plan development, assigns tasks, con-solidates inputs, resolves conflicting requirements, and usually drafts the plan. The leader has an obli-gation to improve and streamline the ef fort so the team does not waste time, individually orcollectively. Here are some thoughts on what the leader must do. 2.11.6.1.  Learn all about the plan before meeting with the team. Get and read the reference mate-rials. Have a copy of the plan to be updated. Know it thoroughly. Find out what the OPR wants—in both details and format. 2.11.6.2.  Outline the ob jectives for the effort. Put them on paper to expl ain them clearly to theteam. Ask a friend to review them; if they are not clear, rewrite them until they are. 2.11.6.3.  Identify the required planning tasks and designate the person responsible for each task.Specify the level of detail and format expected from them. Encourage team members to identifyany additional required tasks to make the plan more complete. 2.11.6.4.  Set deadlines when the tasks are to  be complete. Make progress checks on the longlead-time tasks. 2.11.6.5.  Encourage imagination and ingenuity. If team members develop a good idea, give themtime and flexibility to verify the idea. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008572.11.7.  Minimum Alert Preparation Plan. One common assumption in war plans is that there will besome period of warning before an  enemy attacks. During this peri od, the base would implement theOPLAN and begin the preparations it calls for. Most planning also calls for a minimum alert prepara-tion plan to cover the possibility that there would be very little advance notice. When planning, iden-tify the most critical preattack preparation tasks and place them in priority order. Do this for tasks thatsupport the entire base and those for just the unit. Highlight those tasks in the plans. 2.11.8.  Do Not Plan In A Vacuum. Civil engineers are just part of the base team. Good planning canhappen only when all base units contribute. This is the only way to identify support requirements anddevelop agreements to provide or get that support. Be sure to coordinate unit plans with organizationsoutside CE whenever the plans call for or modify support requirements. 2.12.  Plan Updates. It is rarely necessary to totally rewrite a well-written plan, but do not assume prede-cessors did a perfect job; they  could have overlooked something im portant. Review plans on a regularbasis, usually once a year, and update them when necessary. Time-sensitive material requires the most fre-quent updating. If such material has been properly filed by annex, appendix and tab, it is necessary onlyto correct those individual items.  When the new material requires coor dination with other agencies, dis-tribute a copy to each agency s imultaneously and use a co ordination log to simplify follow-up actions.Keep a record file of coordination sheets. 2.13.  Sources of Information. Few indivi duals, if any, know everything needed to prepare contingencyresponse plans. Some useful documents and publications are listed here. Another good source is the expe-riences of others. 2.13.1.  MAJCOM Instructions and Planning Guidance. MAJCOMs prepare guidance that each basein the command is expected to follow. There is no standard content or format for this guidance and isoften provided in OPLANs. A CE planner can spend a lot of time and energy trying to find out if thereis any special MAJCOM guidance. Start with the CE Readiness and Emer gency Management Flightto see what information they have. Two other units on  base may also have  command guidance, theWing Plans and Logistics Plans office. Call MAJCOM CE Readiness and Emergency Managementpersonnel and ask for a list of current command guidance and instructions. If written guidance cannotbe found on base, ask the MAJCOM functional representatives to send copies. 2.13.2.  War Plans/OPLANs with Associated Time-Phased Force and Deployment Lists/ Time-PhasedForce Deployment Data (TPFDL/TPFDD). Operations plans tell where and how forces will be pos-tured to respond to a military threat. The TPFDLs  are a good source to find out what units and howmany personnel to beddown. These plans can be found in the Wing or Logistics Plans offices. Thesedocuments are not the most use r friendly, hopefully this information  is already included in the basereception plan. 2.13.3.  Base Comprehensive Plan. Component Plan O (Contingency Plan) of the comprehensive plancontains information on land use th at can be helpful when  updating other base and unit plans. Thiscomponent plan should address issues such as wart ime disposal of toxic wastes, human wastes, andsolid refuse. This plan reflects the results of other contingency planning. 2.13.4.  USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP), Volume 1, Civil Engineer Supplement. The WMP,HQ USAF, and MAJCOM planning documents provide mission requirements, direction, and guide-lines for periods of national emergency or war. These documents also give general guidelines to aid indisaster planning. The primary audience is MAJCOM planners, but the  Civil Engineer Supplement58AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008provides good background information for the base le vel planner. An airbase WMP can be found inthe Wing or Logistic Plans offices. The CE information is unclassified. 2.13.5.  Identify applicable laws and regulations. Di fferent laws and regulations may apply based onthe location of the installation and whether the op eration is supporting a peacetime or wartime mis-sion. 2.13.5.1.  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Within the CONUS, equip-ment worn by Emergency Responders must be compliant with the Occupational Safety and HealthAct and DOD Instruction 2000.18. According to the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemicaland Biological Defense (JPEO  CBD) this applies to Emer gency Responders, both on militaryinstallations and in support of civil authorities.  Detailed guidance and standard exclusions areavailable from the Department of Defense Chemical and Biological Defense Non-Standard Equip-ment Review Panel. 2.13.5.1.1.  Individual Protective Equipment (IPE).  IPE is personal clothing and equipmentrequired to protect an individual from chemical , biological, and some  nuclear effects in aCBRN-warfare environment. The protective ma sk also protects the  respiratory tract fromradioactive particles. IPE items may, but do not necessarily, meet the requirements of PPE foremergency response where OSHA/NIOSH or AFOSHSTDs apply. 2.13.5.1.2.  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). PPE is equipment designed to protect indi-viduals exposed to hazards from injury or illness in non-military unique occupational environ-ments where OSHA/NIOSH or AFOSHSTDs ap ply, including emergency response toCBRNE incidents in the United States. 2.13.5.1.3.  Military Unique Operations. Military-unique operations are exempt from needingOSHA/NIOSH and AFOSHSTDs ap proval; however, using this exemption within theCONUS is very dangerous. Avoid pre-planning that includes actions that break laws. Duringan emergency, the installation commander may do what is right and protect personnel the bestway possible, but pre-planning that places people in a situation without proper equipment andtraining may lead to civil and/or criminal actions. 2.13.5.2.  Peacetime vs. Wartime. Whether an event is an act of war or a crime is a complex deter-mination, the implications of which will continue to challenge planning and execution for DOD inthe operational environment. Within the Homeland, military  responders and support personnelmust be able to interact at an appropriate level with local, State, territorial, and tribal governmentagencies responsible for protecting their citizens. In the interim,  personnel must be capable ofoperating under the most restricted guidance provided by current Federal and State laws. 2.13.6.  Additional Sources. Many more sources for contingency planning information are listed inAttachment 1 of this publication, particularly the in structions, manuals, and pamphlets in the10-series publications. 2.14.  Summary. Preparing plans is an important step in getting civil engineers ready to respond to a crisis.The process is more important than the product. Civil engineers contribute to most plans written at a base;however, CE is the OPR for the CEMP 10-2. Good pl anning is a major ef fort and should involve morepersonnel than just the Readiness Flight. Any one of the unit officers should be able to lead the prepara-tion of the CE contingency  response plan. This chapter provides guidelines for preparing that plan andidentifies other planning that ci vil engineers must accomplish. A qu ote by British General S ir JohnAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200859Monash puts this chapter in perspective: “The main thing is always to have a plan; if it is not the best plan,it is at least better than no plan at all.” 60AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Chapter 3  RESOURCES 3.1.  Introduction. Plans give focus to  contingency responses, yet are wo rthless unless the resources areidentified and available to carry  plans out. Planning identifies the personnel, supplies, equipment, vehi-cles, and resources required to c onduct disaster responses, base recovery, and other military operations.There is one universal truth with regard to contingencies: you have to respond with the resources at hand.Consequently, preplanning should place an emphasi s on acquiring required resources before a crisisthreatens. Planners should also know how to get additional assets if a  crisis exceeds their assigned capa-bilities. 3.2.  Overview. This chapter is writte n from a civil engineer's perspect ive to help identify requirementsand obtain resources. It is not an authoritative document on personnel, supply, transportation, contractingor other functions. Since those agencies will all execute some level of predisaster planning, contact themif detailed information on their spec ialties is required. The purpose of  this chapter is to provide enoughinformation and plant enough ideas to work with those organizations successfully. 3.3.  Personnel. Personnel are the most  important resource for all aspects of preplanning, recovery andpost disaster actions. CE squadrons are comprised of talented military, government civilians and contrac-tors—the front line forces in a disaster and recovery response. It is imperative that planning considers riskmanagement factors and encourages safe practices. Further, planned exercises should actively assess riskassessment processes and safety practices. The next several paragraphs will discuss broad groups of peo-ple that can assist i n a response, but it is this core of people assign ed and ready-for-duty when disasterstrikes that are the most valuable in the early hours of response. We must ensure they are available whenneeded by performing risk assessments to prevent careless injury with proper safety and risk managementplanning. 3.3.1.  In-Place Forces. Each Base Civil Engineer has a substantial recovery force already in-place inthe form of their squadron members ( Figure 3.1.). Without exception, every CE unit has many tal-ented and dedicated individuals. These very same troops routinely perform mini-miracles when givena little direction, support, and encouragement. Assigned base level CE Squadrons have the home fieldadvantage, because they are already on-scene, intimate with the infrastructure and utility details of thebase, and are already or ganized into a cohesive team. Th ey will also have  a strong motivation torecover their base, homes and communities. A crisis, especially war, dictates a different CE organiza-tional personality than the one that exists during peace. The organization must switch from decentral-ized low intensity facility maintenance to focused high intensity repairs. Rarely will the number andmix of skills in the unit be ideal  for the crisis at hand. However, a CE unit can improve its ability torespond by freely loaning personnel  from one work center to anothe r. A skilled craftsman can makemany repairs with the assistance of untrained, but willing helpers from other CE shops. But this worksonly if individuals are more con cerned with getting the job done a nd less concerned with having the“right” specialties on the job. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200861Figure 3.1.  Engineers Conduct Hurricane Katrina Recovery Operations at Keesler AFB. 3.3.1.1.  Military Personnel. At CONUS bases and a few overseas bases, most CE military person-nel will be assigned to Prime BEEF teams. These individuals are subject to deploy on short notice.Consequently, there can be no guarantee these troops will be available to respond to a local contin-gency. A prudent BCE will assess the capabilities of the remaining military and civilian personneland then prepare plans to respond to disasters with these personnel. 3.3.1.2.  Civilian Personnel. Civilians in the BCE work force constit ute a vital component of thedisaster response and base recovery force. Ci vilian and military positions  absolutely required toprovide an initial contingency response force must be designated  as “key” or "emergency essen-tial." Emergency or mission essential employees are those who are employed at CONUS locationsand are vital to the mission at  their current duty station or anot her CONUS base during a crisisresponse. An emergency-essential employee is a DOD civilian employee  whose assigned dutiesand responsibilities must be ac complished following the evacuation of non-essential personnel(including dependents) during a d eclared emergency or outbreak of war. The position occupiedcannot be converted to a military billet because it requires uninterrupted performance so as to pro-vide immediate and continuing support for combat  operations and/or combat systems supportfunctions. The civilian personnel office will help in designating key or emergency-essential posi-tions. The basic guidance for establishing key and emergency-essential positions is found in AFI36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Workforce. Don’t let anyone harbor the idea a civilian posi-tion is not important if it is not coded key and essential. Disaster response may not be a conditionof employment for the civilians in those positions, but experience shows they too are “critical” andmany will make themselves available during and af ter a crisis without being specif ically called.They are no less dedicated than the military workforce. There is one special wartime considerationat airbases in foreign countries. For security reasons, the locally hired civilians may not be allowedon base following an attack. Consequently, CE military personnel must be able to perform all baserecovery tasks—without the knowledge and skills of their local civilian coworkers. Additionally,determine whether existing agreements exempt  local national employees from mobilization intotheir national armed forces. They too may "deploy." Before planning to use locally hired civilianemployees in an emergency, check with the civilian personnel office. Find out if there are any hostnation laws to consider. 62AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20083.3.2.  Outside Help. Even with the best planning  and preparations, disasters can occur that over-whelm the capabilities of the CE or ganization. A fully manned and in-place CE force will not nor-mally have enough personnel to perform all base  recovery tasks as fast as  needed or to operate 24hours-a-day. There are many ways t o augment the CE unit such as individual augmentees, PrimeBEEF teams, RED HORSE, Army and Navy engineer units, host nation engineers, and contracts. 3.3.3.  Individual Augmentees. Augmentees are available from within CE, from other base organiza-tions and from many off-base sources. Local augmentees have the advantage of being readily avail-able. Off-base sources usually require longer  times to marshal, and may ask for TDY costreimbursement. Keep in mind that most augmentees require training. The Readiness/Emergency Man-agement and EOD functions have used augmentees for many years. 3.3.3.1.  The Ideal Augmentee. The most useful augmentees usually come from within the organi-zation. There is less hierarchy to  go through to get them; they are  easier to get for training; andthey are generally more familiar with the mission. USAFE and PACAF CE units often look withinthe squadron first for EOD augmentees. 3.3.3.2.  On-Base Augmentees. Define requirements for and request local military augmenteesfrom the base Augmentation Duty  program manpower pool whic h is administered by the localmilitary personnel flight. CE will compete with other base organizations for personnel, so developand request Augmentation Duty requirements early . Augmentees will require supervision, trans-portation, tools, equipment, and training. Before requesting them, decide if their muscle power isworth the extra efforts required; usually, it will be. See AFPAM 10-243, Augmentation Duty andthe military personnel flight for additional information on this program. 3.3.3.3.  Uniquely Qualified Individuals. Sometimes civilian employees and military personnel inother base organizations may have especially useful skills. Do not hesitate to ask for their help. 3.3.3.4.  Personnel from Other Bases. For local disasters, other bases may be able to provide assis-tance. Decide what skills and numbers are needed, including supervisory personnel, then make therequest to the MAJCOM by phone and follow up with a message. The MAJCOM staff will deter-mine the source of augmentation. Depending upon conditions, these troops can arrive within 2 or3 days following the request. Feeding, housing and transportation are the unit’s responsibility; thisapplies to both civilian employees and military personnel. 3.3.3.5.  Reserve Components. Air National Gu ard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command(AFRC) unit assigned personnel (individuals, UTC packages and/or entire units) may also be usedfor temporary manpower augmentation. Reserve component members  are ordered to active duty(voluntarily or involuntarily) under Secretary of the Air Forc e written authority through theirrespective gaining MAJCOM. Funds for pay and allowances are provided from the USAF Mili-tary Personnel Appropriation (MPA man-days for volunteers or direct allocations during involun-tary call-up) and are apportioned to each gaining command. Travel and per diem are paid from theusing unit's (or MAJCOM’s) operations and maintenance (O&M) account. Man-days can be madeavailable to bring individuals and teams on bo ard quickly. This works best if the personnelrequested is known and are av ailable. Request these personnel by telephone (and message)through the MAJCOM. 3.3.3.6.  Civilian Over-hire. Hiring additional civilian personnel from the local economy is anoption for some installations. Normally, this can take 30 to 90 days, because position descriptionsmust be written; the positions have to be classified and graded by the civilian personnel office, andAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200863then the jobs recruited. Howeve r, the hiring process can be expe dited during an emergency, andstrong emphasis from the mission s upport group commander can help. The avai lability of localcraftsmen will be the unit’s biggest obstacle. The over hire approach only works well when thelocal market has excess labor. Even then, the excess may or may not have the needed skills. Keepin mind that the unit will ha ve to compete for this labor with the local contractors if the disasterimpacts the surrounding communities. Funds must be available to pay for these forces. The moneycan come from the CE budget, from the base budget, or from the MAJCOM. 3.3.3.7.  Mutual Aid Support. Do not overlook mutual aid agreements. While designed to provideimmediate short-term support, there may be possibilities to modify the agreement to arrange forlonger-term assistance. Be prepared to pay, however, for the additional help. 3.3.3.8.  Military Retirees and the Standby Reserve. Active duty retirees may be ordered to activeduty if the Secretary of the Air Force determines their skills are critical to mission accomplishmentand not available from other military  categories. Retirees do not  usually deploy overseas, butreplace active duty personnel who do. Standby Reserve personnel have completed all obligated orrequired service or have been re moved from the Ready Reserve due  to circumstances of civilianemployment, temporary hardship, etc. These reservists maintain affiliation but are not assigned toa unit, do not perform training, and are only available during full and total mobilization. 3.3.3.9.  Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA). One last  source has limited  application formost bases. IMAs may be available for use dur ing war or the mobilization period preceding war.IMAs are Selected Reserve memb ers not assigned to an organized Reserve unit. They are nor-mally assigned to active duty organizations to fill individual manpower requirements during con-tingency or wartime operations. Forward reque sts, with justification, for IMA manpowerrequirements to the MAJCOM counterpart. Access to IMAs for contingency operations is similarto the process used for ANG/AFRC unit personnel, discussed in paragraph 3.3.3.5. 3.3.4.  Prime BEEF Teams. When a lot of outside help is needed in a hurry, the best choice is to havethe assistance of another P rime BEEF team. Assuming the MAJCOM supports the unit’s request, aPrime BEEF team can be on-site within two days. While supervision is not needed, arrangements forsupplies, vehicle support, billeting, and messing  will be required. If neces sary, a Prime BEEF teamcan bring their own housekeeping or home station training sets so they have a place to sleep. This isunusual, so make a special request for this action. Given a contingency that occurs with limited warn-ing, Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard Prime BEEF teams may require a longer lead time thanacceptable for rapid on-scene support. However, if aware of such units in the local area that can andare willing to help, include this information in the request to the MAJCOM. 3.3.5.  RED HORSE. While RED HORSE support cannot be written into the plans, ask the MAJCOMfor their help. The big advantage with RED HORSE is that their squadron is essentially self-sufficient.They have the talent, vehicles, and heavy equipment to do most major work (Figure 3.2.). While theirheavy equipment may take some time to get to the base, RED HORSE has proven they can move fast.An advance team for the 823rd  RED HORSE Squadron was in plac e at Keesler AFB less than 24hours after Hurricane Katrina hit the base. The follow-on team arrived within the next two days.Based on the track of the storm, they anticipated  they might be needed and prepared to deploy evenbefore Katrina struck. 64AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.2.  RED HORSE Members Assist with Hurricane Recovery Efforts. 3.3.6.  Army/Navy Engineers. Do not overlook the possibility of getting help from nearby Army andNavy engineer units. Like RED HORSE, Army combat engineer units and Navy Seabees have the tal-ent and heavy equipment for base recovery tasks. Contact these units to see if they are willing to help,and then formally request their assistance through the MAJCOM. 3.3.7.  Host Nation Engineers. A few overseas bases may be able to get support from host nation engi-neer units. Find out what their capabilities are, who to contact, and what procedures are required to gettheir support. If the crisis affects a large area, they may ask for support, since CE is likely to have morecapability than the host nation units. 3.3.8.  Contractors. Local  construction companies can provide excellent engineer support; however,getting them on contract may be a challenge. Four conditions must exist to get timely contract supportfor crisis response. First, contract ors must be available; that will be  a problem if they ha ve sufferedsubstantially the same conditions that produced the problem on the installation. In addition, potentialcontractors may already be committed to the local public or private sector. Therefore, unless the con-tract is financially worth their effort, they will have no incentive to redirect their personnel and equip-ment. Second, put in writing what the contractor is to accomplish; this does not always mean detailedplans and specifications. Third, funds must be available. The contracting office must have money, ora very good promise of it, to enter into a contract. Fourth, a good relationship and preplanning with thecontracting office to ensure they are ready to use the inherent flexibility within the procurement regu-lations to provide crisis support is  crucial. Present the requirements to the contracting of fice and letthem decide how to meet the need. Identify pos sible sources, include names, addresses, and phonenumbers if known. When the crisis is over , be sure to acknowledge the good support received, if thecontracting office is used. 3.3.8.1.  Use Requirements Contracts. Requirements contracts can sometimes be used to help withemergencies. This type of contract is used in peacetime when the Air Force knows what goods andservices it desires, but does not know exactly how much it will need during a year. A unit price isagreed upon for the contractor to perform a servic e or deliver goods. When there is a need for anagreed service, the Air Force provides the mone y and informs the contractor how many units ofservice is desired. These contracts are usually good for just one year and have a minimum numberof units the Air Force must ask  for and a maximum number the contractor has to deliver. CE hasAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200865used requirements contracts to remove snow, clear debris, and paint buildings. Simplified Acqui-sition Base Engineer Requirements (SABER) contracts are ideal for contingency support; almostevery kind of construction possible is within its scope. If such a contract exists, some basic provi-sions may already include tasks needed to help with base recovery. There is no reason not toinclude anticipated base recovery tasks. Ensure the contracting  office, and the contractor, knowsthe tasks are for emergencies. If possible, do not apply the minimums or maximums to those items,but be fair. In an emergency affecting civilian areas as well AF property, the price of constructionmaterials tend to increase. Contractors may have to be allowed to recover material costs in such asituation. The contractor cannot afford to subsidize the Air Force for factors beyond their control.If the contractor is treated fa ir and a good relationship develope d during normal times, there is areasonable chance the contractor will remain loyal to the AF dur ing a crisis. That relationship isimportant, because there is practically nothing that can be done if the contractor was already obli-gated and could not support the requirement. Be sure to include a list of these contracts in the CEcontingency response plan. 3.3.8.2.  Develop Emergency Contracts. Attempt to secure an emergency contract to cover a situ-ation when no other contract is available. These types of contracts will always occur faster and bebetter when there is a strong relationship betw een the engineers and the  contracting office. Thatrelationship is developed from  consistent peacetime cooperation and earned trust; commandemphasis also helps. Do not overlook any avenue to satisfy mission requirements. Be aware of thelevel of contract effort taking place on the ba se and understand what waivers are required toaccomplish diversion; it may invo lve adding a contingency clause. If unable to find a solutionworking with the base-level contracting office, seek advice from the MAJCOM. 3.3.9.  CONUS Sustaining Backfill Requirements. Wh en Prime BEEF mobility personnel deploy insupport of major contingency operations, the losing BCE must: 3.3.9.1.  Quantify the expected voids in the work force and indicate which voids contract supportcan fill and which will require active or reserve military backfill. 3.3.9.2.  Identify and prioritize all mission-essential tasks that backfill forces must perform (e.g.,sewage, water, power, and heat plant operations; emergency service call operations; readiness/emergency management, EOD, FES, etc). 3.3.9.3.  Identify all missio n-essential tasks that require special licenses and certifications (e.g.,water plant operations, industrial waste plant operations, FES, etc.). 3.3.9.4.  Address the use of the base’s non-deployed active duty personnel and critical essentialcivilian members to support the installation’s mission. 3.3.9.5.  List minimum training augmenting forces will require to become familiar with the base'sequipment and operations. 3.4.  Supplies and Equipment. Traditionally, CE turns to base supply or the ba se contracting office—before and after disasters—for supplies and equipment. This section presents ideas on how to obtain thesupplies and equipment needed. 3.4.1.  Situation. The rules for getting supplies and equipment have become less rigid over the years.The Air Force is moving away from mandatory worldwide procedures and giving commanders morelatitude and authority. Users, base supply, and the contracting office have far more flexibility to set uplocal procedures to handle local needs. Many Air Force instructions and manuals still apply, but they66AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008present guidelines for smart individuals rather than inflexible proc edures. This does not mean thatroadblocks are nonexistent. Look for the experts in each organization that understand how the supplysystem works. It also helps to become familiar with AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual. 3.4.2.  Funding. Increased flexibility and local control discussed in  the previous paragraph requiresadditional local funding. Less centralized funding of supplies and equipment requires users to fund formore of the materials needed. This puts an added challenge on installations when preparing for contin-gencies. Engineers must divert funds from their budgets to build reasonable stockpiles of supplies andequipment required to respond to disasters. Due to limited funds, it may take engineers a few years tobuild the needed stockpiles. Ai r Force budgets do not  reserve funds for peacetime emer gencies ordisaster relief operations. Air Force commanders must use available funds as they see fit to protect lifeand property. Recurring conditions present a different situation. Civil engineers can and should budgeteach year for supplies and equipmen t for snow removal and other r ecurring events that can becomecrises. 3.4.3.  Determining Requirements. In addition to receiving assistance from the MAJCOM, the follow-ing approach may help when developing requirements. 3.4.3.1.  Timing. The best time to determine requirements is  while preparing or updating plans.Identify materials and equipment to support the plans. Use a planning group to scrub the require-ments and be careful not to overstate them; each recommendation should be justified. 3.4.3.2.  Planning Factors. Determine equipment and material quantities by using planning factors.Requirements vary by base, the severity of the di saster, the solution one chooses to solve a prob-lem, and many other variables. Some  planning factors and requirements are relatively easy todevelop; the number of sandbags  in a berm is a good example, wh ich follows. The standard bagsize of 4"x8"x16" yields a volu me of 0.3 cubic foot per bag. De termine the dimensions of thesandbag structure, calculate the volume of soil needed (in cubic f eet), and divide by 0.3 to deter-mine the number of sandbags required. 3.4.3.2.1.  Most material planning factors and requirements for base recovery are very difficultto determine. In those cases, make an educated guess. If available, borrow planning factorsfrom other bases exposed to the same crises . Unit personnel are in the best position to makethe assumptions and to use g ood engineering judgment to develop the planning factors andrequirements. Document any planning factors used in the contingency response plan or in apermanent, not-to-be-retired-or-destroyed file in the Readiness and Emer gency ManagementOffice. 3.4.3.2.2.  The Readiness and Emergency Management Flight officer should review the plan-ning factors at least once during their assignment to make sure they are still valid. This shouldbe a common-sense look versus a detailed technical review. 3.4.3.3.  Reality Check. After dete rmining the necessary amount of  requirements, look at theresults to verify if the numbers look reasonable and if there is balance in the requirements; if not,adjust the numbers. Unrealistic numbers are possible if the calculations  are blindly relied upon.There are no criteria to  perform this assessment; the reality check is an intuitive, common senseassessment. 3.4.3.4.  Availability Check. Once requirements are known, determine the quantity alreadyon-hand or normally available. Also, ascertain what and how much is re adily available throughAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200867local sources. The difference between the sum of these numbers and the total requirements will bethe deficit and must be ordered for contingency stockpiles. 3.4.3.5.  Common Items for Disaster Response.  Table 3.1. lists supplies commonly needed inemergencies; however, there may be many other needed items, but this list should stimulate think-ing. Do not forget common shop equipment the unit uses every day, especially radios and batter-ies, and specialized firefighting, readiness/emergency management, and explosive ordnancedisposal equipment. 3.4.3.6.  Minimum Stocks Required. Contact the MAJCOM for required peacetime and wartimestock levels. Some examples of items which may have minimum levels include: 3.4.3.6.1.  Firefighting Agents. AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Preven-tion Program, details the peacetim e minimum stock levels of firefighting agents equal to thetotal capacity of assigned firefighting vehicles at the fire station. Check with the MAJCOM forany guidance on required wartime stock levels for firefighting agents. 3.4.3.6.2.  Demolition Explosives. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) flights are required tomaintain demolition explosives according to  AFI 32-3001. The type and quantity of explo-sives are listed in the EOD Equ ipment and Supplies Listing (ESL) for Prime BEEF mobilityteams and AFCAT 21-209, Munitions Allowances for Individual Training and Training Unitsfor training munitions. Check to see if there are MAJCOM directives pertaining to demolitionexplosives. Demolition explosives listed in the ESL are configured and maintained in readilydeployable condition for either air or over the road movement. 3.4.3.6.3.  Heating Fuels. While no longer dictated by Air Force publications, MAJCOMs mayspecify minimum levels for solid, liquid, and gas heating fuels. 3.4.4.  Classes of Supply. The supply system categorizes materiel  in ten classes. Those classes arelisted in the USAF WMP, Volume 1 and are shown in Table 3.2. 68AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008ITEMS IN  HOLDING AREA sandbags, flares,  nails,  steel cable,  rope,  emergency lights,  reflectors, tarpaulins, common use tools,  large plumbing items, special use pumps,  plastic sheeting,  small generators BULK STORAGE sand,  gravel,  clay,  select fill (ADR), snow & ice control chemicals, salt, water treatment chemicals, fire extinguishing agent,  concrete block, brick,  culverts, snow fencing, fencing  Table 3.1.

On-Base Stock and Stockpiles. This paragraph outlines the s ources most often used by baseengineers. The first place one turns to get supplies and equipment is obviously from the stock alreadyon-base. Experience has shown that the supplies and equipment available for day-to-day operationsare often adequate for many peacetime contingencies or disaster situations. 3.4.6.1.  Base Supply Stock. Some of the items needed in an emergency may be available on theshelves in base supply wa rehouses. To be responsive to customer needs, base supply attempts tokeep a backup stock of high use items. Supply  uses its computer to track demands on each itemthey handle and to develop a historic demand level. Base supply uses stock funds to buy high useitems that users have not yet called for. Base supply reorders items based on the demand level. In70AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008other words, supply will often order high demand items in bulk. Items with a low consumptionrate are ordered infrequently, and it is possible none will be on  the shelves. High demand itemswill be more readily available, because a pipeline for them has been established. The user pays forthese items when issued. 3.4.6.2.  Bench Stock. The CE bench stock is set up to support the day-to-day facility operationand maintenance activities of the CE organization. However, bench stock can be a ready source ofsupplies for the CE DRF. Bench stock puts high us e, expendable items near the user rathe r thankeeping them in the base suppl y warehouses. This convenience ma kes bench stock the first stopfor supplies—after shop stock, of course. They are go od sources for materials in an emergency,because they include the items most commonly  used every day by CE. There are many items inbench stock, but quantities of each item are limited and can only support small disasters. 3.4.6.2.1.  A key feature with bench  stock is that the user cont rols them. The using organiza-tion decides what items are added and deleted and sets the authorized level for each item. Thisis only fair since the user pays for the bench stock items at the time of issue from base supplyeven though the items are not used until a later date. Bench stock is built around shop foremenrecommendations. 3.4.6.2.2.  Pure contingency response items can also be added, but keep two points in mind: 1)whatever is added must be paid for immediately; 2) low usage items have a way of being mis-placed, usually out of neglect but sometimes  from theft, and may not be available whenneeded. 3.4.6.2.3.  Setting up a bench  stock requires continuous management. Base supply does notautomatically refill bench stock; to get replenishment, a refill demand has to be placed on basesupply. A bench stock item is no rmally reordered when the number of items in a bin is lessthan 50 percent of the authorized level. The perc entage is arbitrary and set by the user. It canbe lower or higher and does not have to be the same for all items. This process allows the orga-nization to control the amount of money it spends on bench stock. 3.4.6.2.4.  When bench stock items have not been reordered for long periods, the base supplycomputer will highlight the item as a candidate for deletion from bench stock. This is the idealtime for the organization to reassess that contingency item to make sure it is still required. Newtechnologies make some items obsolete, but do not arbitrarily eliminate a serviceable item justbecause there is a new technology. The shop foremen should be i nvolved in identifyingrequirements for contingencies so they will understand why each item is included in the benchstock during the periodic bench stock reviews. This logic applies to all contingency items andsources. 3.4.6.2.5.  A practical way to enha nce bench stock support for emergencies is to increase theauthorized levels for items the planning team anticipates the unit will need most during contin-gencies. If an authorized level based on normal consumption is adequate to cover contingencyrequirements, no adjustments are necessary. Increasing the stock levels over 2 to 3 years maybe necessary to control costs. Bench stock  is not an efficient method for providing lowdemand, high value, or bulk items. 3.4.6.3.  Self-Help Store. This source is separate from base  supply stocks and CE bench stock atmany bases but remains a generally healthy source of common facility maintenance parts. Be cau-AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200871tious about accounting as some self help stores stock a mix of housing- purchased and FacilityOperations purchased items driving a potential need to account and reimburse. 3.4.6.4.  Special Levels. Special levels  may be established in base s upply to ensure critical itemsare on hand in the required quanti ties to support base contingencies. The demand for such itemsusually does not warrant addition to bench stock,  but are mission essential and must be readilyavailable. The user identifies the minimum quantity to be kept on hand, but do not expect supplyto stock more than that number. Special levels are very important at overseas bases, especially incountries where supplies and equipment are not readily available from local suppliers. Be sure tolist special level items that support continge ncies in the CEMP 10-2. Doing so provides theauthority and justification for base supply to maintain thos e special level items. Special levelrequests are submitted on AF Form 1996. 3.4.6.4.1.  Special levels are attractive, because the user does not pay for those items until theyare issued from base  supply. This arrangement ties up  base supply’s limited stock fund, sofocus on getting special levels for the most  mission critical items and those with the longe stlead times. Naturally, it is desirable to get the more expensive items covered as well. Attemptto get all necessary items on special level, but be  prepared to compromise, listen, and workwithin the supply system. 3.4.6.4.2.  Base supply usually stores and keeps track of special le vel item(s), but specialarrangements can be made to store selected items in the CE area. This gives CE physical con-trol, but CE will also ha ve to find the r oom to store the items, and  keep track of them. Thisreduces the chance that base supply will misplace the item or classify it as excess. However,CE runs this same risk if the items are not clearly marked and routinely inventoried. 3.4.6.4.3.  The chief of s upply has the option to establish c ontracts for special level items,either blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) or requirements contracts. As BPAs involve noexpenditure of funds until exercised, this type of contract is most often favored by base supply.From the BCE perspective, this means that the item is not physically  “on the shelf” in basesupply, but must be purchased when the demand is made; a lead time delay may be involved. 3.4.6.5.  Seasonal Items. So me items have a higher  demand at different times of the year. Con-sumption is so irregular on these items that the demand level does not provide satisfactory support.Work with base supply to ensure  adequate stock of seasonal items  is on hand at the right times.This approach can help units better prepare for cyclic conditions that can turn into an emergency,such as an exceptionally heavy  blizzard. Order these items early and keep track of their deliverystatus. The unit may have to negotiate as to which items base supply will hold in their warehousesand which CE must pay for up front. Some seasonal items are purchased by the user as bulk deliv-ery items. 3.4.6.6.  Bulk Delivery Items. Some  items are logically ordered in  bulk; sand, gravel, salt, rock,urea, bark-mulch, crushed sea shells, water and sewage treatment plant chemic als (includingindustrial water treatment) and oi l absorbent are a few examples ( Figure 3.3.). They often findextra applications during emergency situations. Most bulk items are ordered by sending a pur-chase request from the user to the contracting office. Base supply is not usually involved, becausebulk items are difficult to manage. For example, it is ha rd to count the cubi c yards in a pile ofgravel and know if two yards ar e missing. Operating level for ea ch item should be periodicallyreviewed, and quantities should be adjusted when warranted. 72AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure 3.3.  Stockpile Storage Yard. 3.4.6.7.  Residual Holding Area. This  BCE holding area contains resi due from work orders, andmay contain useful items in an emergency. Do not count on any specific item being there when adisaster hits; inventories often change. Items ma y be identified and marked for disaster support.The unit has already paid for these items and requires no additional funds. 3.4.6.7.1.  Occasionally, walk through the holding area to make sure the contingency supportitems are still there. The BCE must keep track of what supplies and equipment are in the hold-ing area. In addition, k eep track of items by looking at  the periodically updated inventorysheet. The shop foremen should definitely know what is in the holding area inventory. 3.4.6.7.2.  There is a good chance that mechanical and electrical equipment stored in the hold-ing area and exposed to the elements will not work if stored for a long time. It is a good idea tostore these type items in an indoor holding area, and if important, have the shops periodicallyinspect and service them. 3.4.6.8.  CE Contingency Stock. CE can always buy critical supplies and equipment. These itemsmay be stored in the shops, in th e residual holding area, or at  any location selected by the BCE.The best way to justify buying and storing these items is to list them in the IGESP or the CE Con-tingency Response Plan. Inventory these stocks periodically to ensure they are still available. Donot count on backup stock in base supply unless the unit routinely orders these items. 3.4.7.  Contractor Operated Civil  Engineer Supply Store (COCESS). The supply system is often notresponsive to CE needs because of  all the non-standard parts engin eers deal with, unlike the aircrafton base which the supply system can support well. Civil Engineers have tried many ways to improvesupply support and one of most successful is COCESS. For most CE units, COCESS is the key to get-ting needed supplies and equipmen t quickly. This is true for both  routine and disaster support. Ofcourse, CE still has access to base supply, but they generally try to follow one basic rule in this case:only one source of supply  for an item. Base suppl y does not want to handle items available throughCOCESS. This keeps base supply from having to tie up their stock funds to put backup items on theirshelves which have low demand le vels. Conversely, COCESS should not stock items that are alsoused by other organizations on base. Those items belong in base supply. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008733.4.7.1.  COCESS is essentially a requirements contract. The CE  unit lists the types of suppliesand equipment and approximately how much of each item it will need in a year. CE also providesa facility for the contractor. The COCESS contractor sets up a bench stock operation and getsmaterials for work orders. The prices for most of the items are set by the contract. There are pro-visions to get unanticipated materials as well. 3.4.7.2.  Under COCESS, special levels can be set  up. The BCE can either require the contractorto stock selected items (usually done at a prem ium price) or ask the contractor to pre-identifysources of supply that can satisfy emergency requirements within acceptable time limits. 3.4.8.  Local Vendors. Each CE unit should be aware of the civilian suppliers in the area that possessthe types of inventories  useful to the unit. Even with COCESS, this backup is  needed should theCOCESS contractor fail to meet the unit’s needs. In fact, identify and list these vendors in the CE con-tingency response plan as a source of materials following an emergency. Primary concerns when deal-ing with off-base civilian suppliers are transportation and payment requirements. 3.4.8.1.  For the supplies to be useful , they must be transported to  the work area. If CE does nothave vehicles available to pick-up the needed supplies, ask the vendor if they can deliver. This canbe a problem during emer gencies. The vendor may  not have enough trucks  to transport the sup-plies, or the roads leading to the base from the vendor location may be impassable. It is generallynot advisable to depend on the vendor to deliver supplies under emergency conditions. Base sup-ply or transportation may be able to help. 3.4.8.2.  Suppliers are  normally paid by government chec k after receiving the bill and beingassured by the receiving unit that the goods have  been delivered in serviceable condition. Duringemergencies, a civilian supplier, especially in overseas areas, may be reluctant to accept the gov-ernment’s promise or check in payment for goods received. In that case, provisions will have to bemade for a cash payment. 3.4.8.3.  Other factors that might limit or eliminate the use of civilian suppliers are: 3.4.8.3.1.  Civilian resources ma y be damaged or de stroyed from the same disaster whichimpacted the base. 3.4.8.3.2.  The civilian vendor may have previous commit ments to furnish supplies to thecivilian community. 3.4.8.3.3.  The civilian ven dor may take an opportunistic ap proach at the time of the emer-gency and sell goods only to the highest bidder. 3.4.8.3.4.  If the emergency involves a hostile action, the civilian supplier in the overseas areamay change alliances at this critical time and refuse to sell goods to the US. 3.4.8.3.5.  In some overseas theaters, civilian suppl iers of the military may become targets ofterrorists and other covert action groups. 3.4.8.3.6.  Overseas suppliers may also fall in the category where their inventories are essen-tially nationalized by their national military forces. 3.4.9.  GOCESS. In some insta nces, government operated civil engi neer supply store (GOCESS) isused in lieu of COCESS.  While there are some procedural dif ferences, the two operations look thesame to the user. 74AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20083.4.10.  CE Mobility Equipment. If the unit is short of hand tools and equipment following a disaster,do not forget about the Prime BEEF team kits. There is no better reason to use them than a crisis. Letthe MAJCOM know that the unit is no longer ready to deploy immediately if the Prime BEEF kits areused. Details of Prime BEEF team kits are contained in the Prime BEEF Equipment and Supplies List-ing. 3.4.11.  War Reserve Materiel (WRM). WRM assets, managed according to the policies contained inAFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures, once were essentiallyuntouchable during peacetime; this has changed. MA JCOMs set the policy for  the assets under theircontrol. With some restrictions, WRM may be used  in peacetime for disaster relief, mercy missions,and humanitarian purposes (flood, earthquake, major accidents, etc.). Generally, the wing commanderof the storing base can author ize the peacetime use of WRM w ithout advance approval from HQUSAF or other approval authorities when such eq uipment is required for an imminent emer gency ofpolitical or humanitarian significance. When this authority is exercised, HQ USAF or other approvalauthority must be notified promptly. If these assets are not on base, but needed, ask the MAJCOM toprovide them quickly. 3.4.11.1.  Prepositioned Assets. Most WRM assets are prepositioned to place the asset as close aspracticable to its point of use. Prepositioning depends on such variables and constraints as warningtime, unit readiness, security of the area, terminal facilities, storage capacity, maintenance, distri-bution capability, and survivability. Some WRM assets are dispersed to enhance their survivabil-ity. In the event of total mobilization, airlift  capability would be a  limiting factor. Therefore,certain prepositioning actions have already been accomplished that will help civil engineer forces(and others) accomplish their wartime mission. For instance, both USAFE and PACAF have BaseExpeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) housekeeping packages in storage. RED HORSE andADR heavy equipment are also stored at several locations in Europe. In addition, USCENTAF hasgreat quantities of BEAR equipment and vehicle fleets stored  in Southwest Asia in order to sup-port rapid deployment forces to that part of  the world. These housekeeping and heavy equipmentpackages have their own UTCs and are pushed to their employment locations based on OPLANs.Bases that are to receive these  packages should write operating instructions for setting up theassets and include them in the CE contingency response plan. 3.4.11.2.  ADR Equipment Sets. Prepositioning ADR sets has increased the crater repair capabilityat selected overseas main operating bases (MOB). These sets are generally located at bases vulner-able to attack, and may be deploy ed to other sites if needed ( Figure 3.4.). Prepositioning craterrepair and spall repair materials and equipment has enhanced Air Force civil engineers’ ability tosupport the wartime flying miss ion. The MAJCOM evaluates speci fic regional threats to deter-mine ADR set requirements and appr opriate levels of WRM, such  as crushed stone, fiberglassmats, precast concrete slabs, and spall repair materials for each base. ADR vehicle sets aredescribed in UFC 3-270-07, Airfield Damage Repair. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200875Figure 3.4.  Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) Equipment. 3.4.11.2.1.  ADR war reserve materiel  assets must be kept serviceable at all times as directedby AFI 25-101. Several organizations (supply, civil engineer, and transportation) store andmaintain portions of the ADR set. Special stock levels should be es tablished as required byeach MAJCOM to keep the ADR equipment serviced and in-commission at the base. 3.4.11.2.2.  The WRM mobility secti on of base supply and the us er must periodically inven-tory and inspect WRM equipment  and materials. While in stor age, inspections are made toensure the items are present and serviceable.  After use and before being returned to stock,tools and components should be inventoried and serviced. 3.4.11.3.  Other WRM (O-WRM). Some  bases are authorized to keep a special stock of suppliesand equipment called Other WRM. These items do not usually directly support aircraft operationsbut are important to sustain wartime operations. In effect, these stocks are special levels, but paidfor by WRM funds supplied by the MAJCOM. 3.4.12.  Home Station Training Sets. Items in the home station traini ng sets can be  used to supportemergencies. The allowance for these sets is c ontained in AS 429. They are authorized at CONUSunits with a mobility tasking and are not WRM assets. 3.4.13.  Military Supply Points. Military supply points are established to bring supply support closerto the user. They may be used to support Air Force activities at any contingency location where thereis no base supply function. In effect, the supply point becomes a base supply to the users in those sit-uations. Military supply points are also used overseas to support large or specialized supply items thatare normally available only from a depot located  thousands of miles away and requiring weeks, oreven months, to reach the requesting unit. For example, the 38 CTS at Ramstein AB, Germany servesas a military supply point for gener ators and aircraft arresting systems for USAFE units. The MAJ-COM can inform the unit if such supply points exist for CE items. 3.4.14.  Resupply. A few words are needed about resupply for overseas bases during wartime or majorcontingencies. During major crises, military supply sources  may be unable to support resupply76AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008requests from all units. Main base supply or ganizations will rapidly exhaust  their resources. Quickresupply from depots or CONUS locations is doubtful due to limited ai rlift availability, especially inthe early stages of a conflict. During that period,  aircraft will be fully involved in moving militaryforces and their equipment into th e theater of operations. Resupply  by air is even less likely for thebulky construction materials needed by civil engineers. For these reasons, planning guidance empha-sizes that overseas units should be capable of operating  for 30-60 days without resupply during war-time. This gives time for the military to establ ish the land and sea resupply pipeline. MAJCOMs setthe prepositioning objectives, but they do change, so follow MAJCOM guidance. 3.4.14.1.  Traditionally, Class IV materials are “pushed” to a theater of operation during the earlystages of a conflict. The items are sent based on requirements outlined by the theater unified/jointcommand in its CESP, which is part of the command’s OPLAN. MAJCOM requirements are con-solidated with the other US milita ry services in theater. The requirements may not cover everypossible item needed. They provide for a variety of items within a supply class. The user then hasto make do with what arrives. Eventually, with the supply pipeline operating, the resupply opera-tion begins to accommodate “pulle d” items. Those items are s hipped based on specific userrequests. Unless moved by air, the Air Force depe nds on other services to move goods from theCONUS to the theater ports and then to airbases; by itself this is not a problem. However, the unitmay or may not get what is needed. Items have a way of being diverted or stolen at the ports andat other intermediate destinations. Other units with the same re quirements also compete for sup-plies. Whenever authorized, order materials against aircraft sup port priorities. Working with theMAJCOM, understand what Class IV supplies are available through the joint command and whatmust be done to get them. Also,  find out if there are agreements  for resupply from local sources.Good HNS will reduce prepositioning requirements. 3.4.14.2.  The need for supplies a nd equipment can vary greatly depending on mission, location,extent of damage, etc. In future conflicts, expe ct more flexible resupply procedures to be used.This was accomplished during  Operations DESERT SHIELD/STORM. A military supply pointwas set up at Langley AFB to handle Air Force requirements. The supply point had the capabilityto order and track material just as a base supply operation could. This unit also coordinated airliftrequirements and set movement  priorities. The use of computer s and satellite communicationsallowed for very rapid ordering of supplies and  equipment. Requests were often processed fromthe units in the AOR to vendors within a matter of hours. To speed delivery to the units, items wereoften shipped from the supplier  directly to the final destination (e.g. by Fe deral Express) ratherthan by truck from the supplier to a CONUS aerial port to await transshipment by military or con-tract aircraft. 3.4.14.3.  Even with new t echnologies and procedures, engineers  must still face the reality thatbulky construction materials will  not get high priorities for  movement from the CONUS. Whilethey may eventually be shipped by sea, civil engineers must develop local sources of resupply. 3.4.15.  Informal Sources. There are some informal sources of supply when little else is working. Thesupply sources that a civil engineer unit normally uses will be limited or nonexistent during times ofdisaster. Since it is during these ti mes of limited resources that the services of the civil engineer unitare most important, no source of  resupply should be overlooked. An  effective salvage operation cancomplement the resupply network. Facilities damaged beyond repair  during the emergency shouldalways be considered sources of equipment and materials for base recovery. Another option is to can-nibalize undamaged lower priority facilities to get materials to support hi gh priority facilities. As aAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200877last resort, borrow, scrounge, or barter from nearby units of any service. Although many items will notbe available through these methods, the innovative  use of the resources that can be recovered orobtained will reduce the demands on the supply system at this critical time and will hasten the recov-ery effort. 3.4.16.  Protect Supplies and Equipment. Protect materials after receiving them. There are many waysto lose supplies; here are a few to consider: 3.4.16.1.  While not wanting to dwell on it, the greater the shortage, the more materials are at riskfrom pilfering. 3.4.16.2.  Materials can also be lost due to war damage or natural disaster. Consider protecting themost critical materials by dispersing them or putting them in prot ected areas such as revetments.Unfortunately, dispersing puts material at greater risk of pilferage. 3.4.16.3.  The biggest challenge to ke ep materials intact is the routine use of  contingency stock-piles. There is a tendency to raid  those stockpiles when a unit runs short of an  item in its regularstock. There is nothing wrong with  either practice as long as su pplies are quickly replaced. Toooften that is not accomplished, us ually due to a shortage of funds . Even when no disaster threat-ens, materials have a way of vanishing without any record. Periodic availability checks and inven-tories help expose these problems. 3.4.16.4.  Weather-sensitive products should be monitored closely (like urea). Open storage of saltand urea should be avoided. The greatest chance for contamination of ground water is at the stor-age site. The weather may degrade the product, re ndering it useless. Runoff from stockpiles mayclog storm drains, so monitor drainage systems carefully. 3.4.16.5.  Rotate stock with a shelf life. The CE logistics section should have procedures to makesure shelf-life materials do not go bad, but they need the cooperation of the shop foremen. 3.4.17.  Cost Accounting. Certain expenditures during contingency operations are reimbursable. Thisplaces great importance on  accurate and timely recording of  expenditures. However, the initialresponse phase of a contingency operation is not the time to worry about reimbursements; take care ofthe situation first. The CE cont ingency response plan should contain an operating instruction formaintenance engineering to open a work order and to notify financial management to track costs. 3.4.18.  Emergency Requisition. Rather than cite the public laws or Federal Acquisition Regulationswhich change, it is sufficient for civil engineers to know that both base supply and the base contract-ing office have provisions for getting supplies and equipment expeditiously under emergency condi-tions. Check with them in advance to find out what must occur for them to use those provisions. 3.5.  Vehicles. Obviously, vehicles are needed to move personnel, supplies, and equipment. Special equip-ment is also needed to perform heavy construction  and base recovery tasks.  The CE fleet includes bothgeneral and special purpose vehicles which are often adequate for most situations encountered duringcontingencies. The best way to ensure vehicles ar e available for a contingenc y is to have an activeday-to-day vehicle management program and good maintenance support. That program is outlined in AFI24-301, Vehicle Operations. State all vehicle requirements in the CE Contingency Response Plan orIGESP whether the unit currently has them or not. Sometimes units only copy their vehicle authorizationlist and fail to include special purpose vehicles they need for a recovery effort. 78AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20083.5.1.  General Purpose (GP)  Vehicles. GP vehicles form the backbone of the fleet. Allowance Stan-dard 019 lists vehicles allowed for normal operations. The unit should review the Allowance Standardto confirm its allowance and then submit a request  to the transportation squadron stating the unit’ srequirement with justification. The base must assign priorities to al l requests. When the wing Logis-tics Group commander approves the request, it is then sent to MAJCOM where it competes for com-mand priority with requirements  from the other bases in the co mmand. The MAJCOM gets fundingtargets from the Air S taff. The command will r ecommend buys from its prio rity list until reachingeach fiscal year funding target. MAJCOM requirements are sent to the Air Staff and consolidated forfiscal year buy programs by Warner-Robbins Air Logistics Center. This process often requires annualupdates and revalidation, because there is very limited funding fo r replacing vehicles. Acquiring anew vehicle can easily take three to four years—or longer. 3.5.1.1.  Occasionally, the unit may get a temporary loan from  the transportation squadron toreplace a vehicle that is deadlined for maintenance or parts. Usually, the unit must accommodatethe need within its fleet or temporarily rent a vehicle. 3.5.1.2.  Civil engineers (and other  support units) have one recurring  problem with GP vehicles.These vehicles are subject to recall and redistribution to other ba se units with a higher priority ,especially during contingencies when CE also needs them most. There has not been many ef fec-tive ways to counter this problem. Let the commanders know the impact on the unit’s capabilitieswhen this happens. Work with the transportation squadron and the logistics group commander toensure unit vehicles are listed with appropriat e priorities for the vari ous contingencies. Knowwhich of the unit vehicles are subject to being  pulled away to support others and do not count onthem being available. The commander’s weekly update briefing (if applicable) is a good forum tohighlight overall vehicle status and specific problems. 3.5.2.  Special Purpose Vehicles. Experience shows that this category of vehicles is most often criti-cally short during contingency operations (Figure 3.5.). Depending on the installation’s mission,other base agencies may be authorized vehicles similar or identical to those in the CE fleet. If this isthe case, a listing of such specia lized equipment, by type or cap acity and by organization (includingArmy Air Force Exchange Service,  non-appropriated funds, etc.) should be maintained in the CECRP. Figure 3.5.  Special Purpose Contingency Vehicles. 3.5.2.1.  The unit receives special purpose vehicles in the same manner as that of general-purposevehicles. However, special purpose vehicles tend to be expensive and compete for the same pot ofAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200879money as general-purpose vehicles. The temptation is very strong for the command to recommendbuying ten pickups for daily use rather than one excavator. There are no good solutions except tobe thorough when preparing the request; make the justification strong, but realistic. Line up MAJ-COM support in advance by le tting the MAJCOM CE staf f know what the unit needs and why .They can, and should, support those needs. Occasionally, the MAJCOM or Air Staff will providevehicles in a downward directed program. Many  ADR and firefighting vehicles were purchasedthat way. To obtain a vehicle not listed in an  allowance standard requires a powerful justificationand usually needs to show cost savings. Based on experience, the special purpose vehicles listed inTable 3.3. are critical assets during contingencies. Table 3.3.  Special Purpose Vehicles Important for Contingency Operations. Special Purpose Vehicles Crane  Front-End Loader and Attachments Backhoe Grader Low Boy with Tractor High-Reach/Bucket Truck Sweeper (Flightline and Street) Water Distribution Truck Dump Trucks Bulldozer Line Truck Mobile Emergency Operations Center (MEOC) ADR Equipment and Vehicle Set Aircraft Rescue Firefighting (ARFF) Vehicles HAZMAT Response Van/Trailer Up Armored Heavy Hummer Variant (HHV) 3.5.3.  Firefighting Vehicles. Firefighting vehicles (Figure 3.6.) are authorized based on aircraftassigned, or supported, and as specified in AS 019. MAJCOM Fire and Emergency Services identifyspecial requirements. The total number of personnel authorized in each fire department is based on thenumber of firefighters required to manage various emergency events. When contingency circum-stances dictate the use of alternate water sources or refueling points, include this data in the CE CRPfor quick reference. Figure 3.6.  Firefighting Vehicles. 80AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20083.5.4.  Explosive Ordnance Disposal  Vehicles. Both general and sp ecial purpose EOD vehicles areauthorized based upon the mission and MAJCOM unique requirements, and as allowed in AS(s) 012,156, and 456. Special purpose vehicles include the armored vehicles listed in Table 3.3. The vehicleslisted in AS 156 are prepositioned at overseas locations, at CONUS bases  supporting bombing andgunnery ranges, and the Silver Flag Exercise site only. 3.5.5.  Readiness and Emergency Management Vehicles. The mobile emergency operations center(MEOC) is an alert vehicle assigned to the CE Readiness and Emergency Management Flight. It pro-vides the incident commander w ith command, control, and commu nications support for disasterresponse operations. It is typically equipped with communications e quipment (radios, cellular tele-phone, fax machine, public address sy stems), sirens, maps/charts, and other disaster response equip-ment. 3.5.6.  Rental Vehicles. The unit may be able to satisfy shortfalls by renting vehicles and heavy equip-ment. Operation DESERT SHIELD/STORM revealed that this is true for bare  bases as well as formain bases. However, this method of obtaining vehicles and equipment is highly dependent upon thebeddown locations. Less developed nations cannot supply many types of special purpose vehicles aswas experienced in Operations ENDURING and IRAQI FREEDOM. 3.5.6.1.  Shortfalls may exist on a main base when vehicles are damaged, when out-of-commissionfor parts or maintenance, or when there are simply not enough assets. A list of off-base sources forgeneral and special purpose vehicl es should be compiled by the  base and maintained in the CECRP. Where renting is contemplated, blanket purchase agreements (BPA) will prove sufficient atmost main bases. For predictable conditions, such as snow removal, requirements contracts can beconsidered. In either case, actual or sample purchase  requests (AF Form 9) can be prepared inadvance with as much data filled in as possible. File these forms in a convenient location and notethis information in the CE CRP. Sample forms can be included in the plan. 3.5.6.2.  In the case of bare bases, WRM or other vehicles may not be there at all. This is especiallytrue for ADR and other heavy equipment. Arranging for these items in advance may not be possi-ble, but it becomes a high priority after a CE team arrives. The team leader must locate availablecivilian equipment and simultaneously make contact with the contracting officer. This informationshould be covered in the joint support plan for the beddown location. 3.5.7.  Borrowing Vehicles. Depending on the location, it  may be possible to  borrow vehicles fromneighboring bases or other governmental agencies. If so, be sure to include what type of vehicles andpoints of contact in the CRP. 3.5.8.  Spare Parts. Because vehicles are so vital  to CE performance, keeping them operating shouldhave a high priority. Work with base transportation to ensure specialized vehicle repair parts and tiresare available. 3.6.  Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP).  AFCAP is a contingent tool to provide CivilEngineer and Services personnel with  a force multiplier by leveraging  use of the commercial sector inmeeting urgent mission requirements. AFCAP is a cost  reimbursement or firm-fixed price contract toolproviding cost effective, responsive solutions to meet urgent realities of today. The AFCAP tool is onlyavailable for contingency situations and designed for rapid design/c onstruction, service contracts andlogistics/commodity solutions. Depending on urgency, degree of requirements definition or task stability,contracts can be tailored into firm-fixed price, cost-plus fixed fee or cost-plus award fee task orders. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008813.6.1.  AFCAP consists of five key players; 1) the customer, 2) MAJCOM Civil Engineer or Directorof Services, 3) AFCAP program  managers located at HQ AFCESA/CEO, 4) AFCAP contractingofficers (AETC Contracting Detachment at AFCESA), and 5) the six AFCAP contractors (Becht el,CH2M Hill, DynCorp, Readiness Management Support, URS and Washington Group). The customeris responsible for providing on-site contract administration, quality assurance and task order surveil-lance. The MAJCOM Civil Engineer/Director of Services (or delegated individual) provides resourceadvocacy, appropriate programming and guidance on execution method to complete tasks. The AFC-ESA AFCAP program managers work as an interface between customers and the AFCAP contractingofficers to solidify requirements available under this contract. 3.6.2.  AFCAP can be the right choi ce to satisfy increased support requirements and sustain forwardlocations facing extended operational life. The AFCAP contract  has provided continuity—manyAFCAP contractor personnel have been deployed for one year, or in many cases, longer. Power pro-duction and professional engineers are two examples across Southwest Asia. AFCAP can and has pro-vided everything from air traf fic controllers, WRM equipment augmentation, power plants, heavyequipment leases, and even rock quarry operations and concrete batch plants. For civil engineers, theproducts and services can include: planning and design; infrastructure and facility construction, oper-ation, maintenance, sustainment, revitalization;  reconstitution—tear-down, clean-up, repacking, siterestoration, environmental restoration; disaster recovery (terrorist or natural disaster), and the list goeson. Basically, AFCAP can perform any task expected from a CE, Services, or RED HORSE squadron,with only a few exceptions. 3.6.3.  Air Force policy imposes a few constraints on AFCAP use. The initial response and force bed-down for military operations or exercise scenarios cannot be contracted. Public Law limits contractedsupport for CONUS fire crash rescue  to only circumstances where a  shortfall is caused by militarydeployments. Also, contracted EOD support can be  for range clearance operations only . Lastly,AFCAP is not allowed to run a  mortuary operation (inherently Governmental) and cannot operatefield exchanges (money generating activity). 3.6.4.  In addition to AFCAP, other Air Force wide contracts may be in place to fill contingent needs. 3.6.4.1.  Contact AFCESA/CEO, Operations and Programs Support Directorate, at DSN 523-2275or commercial 1-850-283-2275 to discuss specifics and assist you in getting the process started. Atask can be underway in  4 to7 working days, althoug h in emergencies, it may take less than 24hours. 3.6.4.2.  The Air Force Center for Engineering a nd the Environment (AFCEE) also offers readyaccess contract support services. Contact their  Environmental and Construction ContractingDirectorate at DSN 240-6306 or commercial 210-536-6306 for inquiries. 3.7.  Summary. Let personnel, supply, contracting, and transportation work unit requirements, but keepclose track of what they are doing.  If the unit cannot satisfy needs with  assets on base, attempt to findsources in the local community, at other Air Force bases, at other DOD  military installations, with othergovernmental agencies, or with HN military and civilian agencies. Always find out who to contact (name,phone number, address) and what procedures to follow to obtain the desired assets. 3.7.1.  Document that information in the CE CRP. The MAJCOM can be a great source of help to getsupport moving to the base in a hurry. Make requests through the installation commander, but provide82AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008the MAJCOM civil engineer a heads up. By doing that, the MAJCOM CE staff can start working solu-tions to the problem even before a formal request for help arrives. 3.7.2.  This chapter opened with a universal truth and closes with a second. CE needs the help of otherorganizations to acquire resources. Unfortunately, they will not always—and sometimes cannot—deliver the goods. It is tempting to blame others when the unit cannot obtain needed material to sup-port the mission; avoid  the urge. Keep the commander informed and look hard for other ways toaccomplish the job done. Do not take no for an answer, but be prepared to pay for the needed support. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200883Chapter 4  ORGANIZING TO RESPOND 4.1.  Introduction. Organizing CE response teams before a disaster occurs reduces initial postdisaster con-fusion and helps initiate recovery activities quickly. A unit may not have all the personnel or equipmentneeded, but effective organization helps make the resources that are available more effectual. Anticipatewhat tasks will be required before, during, and after a crisis—and then  ensure teams are organized andtrained to perform each task. 4.2.  Overview. This chapter highlights how a typical Air Force base organizes to respond to disasters andhow civil engineers fit into that organization. It provides an example of how CE squadrons can organizefor peacetime postdisaster response and wartime postattack response to  recover the base. The chapterdetails the role and composition of  special response teams that civil  engineers may need, and offers tipsfor organizing those teams. It closes by discussing  the organizational relationship the host CE squadronshould maintain with augmentees during contingency operations. 4.3.  Base Organization for Disaster Response. The Ai r Force relies on the Inst allation Control Center(ICC) and Emergency Operations Center (EOC) for both peacetime  and wartime airbase command andcontrol organization. Additional information on the organization and manning of the ICC and EOC can befound in AFMAN 10-2501. The base level organization for disaster response and base recovery can varybetween bases, but the differences are not usually significant, often only in name. Regardless of how thebase is organized, similar functions and tasks must be performed pe rmitting some relatively universalobservations about organizing for disaster and wartime responses. 4.3.1.  Peacetime Emergencies. The base level disast er response structure is flexible, allowing it toadapt to the situation. Normal base emergency response forces (i.e., FES, security forces, or base med-ical services) handle minor incidents. As resp onse requirements become more complex, the emer-gency response organizational structure expands both horizontally and vertically. The peacetimeorganization focuses on saving lives and protecting property. In 2004, the Air Force formally adoptedthe National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Incident Command System (ICS) to com-ply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 5 to have a single integrated disaster man-agement system. The NIMS concept, and organizational and command structure, is used to respond tomajor accidents, natural disasters, and other peacetime contingencies beyond the full-time emergencyresponse agencies. This concept is implemented as the Air Force Incident Management System(AFIMS) as defined in AFI 10-2501. 4.3.2.  Base Attack Re covery Operations. In high threat areas, enemy combatants, terrorism, andinsurgency actions can be expected. Bases should prepare for damage , intense recovery actions, andpossible hazards, such as UXO and chemical warfare agents, following an attack. 4.3.2.1.  The ICC, led by the wing commander, is responsible for controlling all wing activities tosupport higher headquarters’ taskings. The activities include such things as sortie generation, air-craft maintenance, base defense, base recovery , etc. Since the ICC may be saturated with opera-tional tasks and requirements, the EOC is established as a command and control element to directand monitor preattack survival ac tions and postattack recovery. The EOC, normally directed bythe mission support group comma nder, receives mission requirements from the ICC. The EOCthen provides recovery guidance to lower level  organizations, usually through their control c en-84AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008ters. Just as with peace time responses, civil engineers play a  major role in base recovery opera-tions. 4.3.2.2.  This is not a wholesale organizational change from the peacetime disaster response struc-ture. In fact, the two organizational structures are more alike than different. One difference in thewartime EOC is focus. The wartime EOC organization, like its predecessor the Survival RecoveryCenter (SRC), is created to restore mission capability first and then to save lives and protect prop-erty. In many locations the wartime EOC may closely resemble the SRC in manning and activitiesas the entities' requirements have  not significantly changed and th e EOC construct is flexible toallow for the similarities while the AF adopts a common set of terminology in line with NIMS andAFIMS. 4.4.  Civil Engineer Squadron. Now to the real thrust of this chapter—organizing the CE unit for disasterresponse and base recovery. Figure 4.1. outlines the peacetime organization for a typical CE squadron,and Figure 4.2. shows a further breakout of the operations flight. Alth ough the actual organization canvary between units, this basic structure is sound fo r responding to most crises. Some or ganizationaladjustments must be made for a crisis, especially during war. 4.4.1.  The base civil engineer gene rally controls CE responses from either the CE UCC or from theEOC, depending upon the situation. As a rule of thum b, the BCE will be in the EOC to provide sup-port to the mission support group commander. When in the EOC, the BCE has a small staff from var-ious flights within the CE community to run the CE operations with in the EOC facility. This smallstaff is filling Emergency Support Functions (ESF) along with the Readiness and Emergency Manage-ment Flight (the installation’s emergency managers and OPR for ESF 5). In  a contingency environ-ment, additional personnel are added to perform emergency management cell activities and to receiveand plot facility damage and UX Os. The BCE provides direction to  the CE DCC and to the few CEteams that are directly controlled from the EOC (normally FES, Readiness/Emergency Managementand EOD teams through their senior staff representatives accomplishing ESFs 4 and 5 roles). 4.4.2.  In any disaster, the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight Chief and flight personnelperform many key functions. Th ey advise the mission support  group commander and the BCE onresponse options. They act as fac ilitators and coordinators for the  DRF. They activate the EOC andrespond on-scene with the MEOC, depending on the situation. In each case, they are the custodians ofthe command and control fa cilities and are responsible for doing the little  and big things needed tokeep the EOC or the MEOC operating. The base readiness support team augments the primary Readi-ness and Emergency Management Flight personnel as required. 4.4.3.  Other than the FACC, engineers must activate a control center to direct the efforts of CE forces.The control center keeps the CE fo rces focused on what is most im portant and arranges support forthem. Normally, the Operations Flight Commander leads the cont rol center and is supported byselected flight chiefs, element leaders, damage plotters, and radio operators. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200885Figure 4.1.  Standard CE Squadron Organization and Manning. Figure 4.2.  CE Operations Flight Organization Chart. 4.4.4.  There are some conditions when the CE disaster control center supports, but does not direct, theactions of selected CE teams. At major accidents and for “normal” emergencies, firefighters are con-trolled on-scene by an incident commander (IC) that is the senior fire officer (SFO), and supported bythe FACC and the CE control center. During recovery operations, the IC will direct operations at theincident site. In addition, during recovery operations, the damage assessment teams (DAT) and EODteams are normally controlled directly from the EOC due to time sensitive response requirements. 4.4.5.  Another organizational adjustment is to form teams capable of responding to anticipated emer-gencies and performing recovery tasks in respons e to the emergency. When possible, organizingresponse teams should be nothing mo re than assigning anticipated  tasks to existing BCE shops orflights. Ideally, every response team would consist of individuals from only one shop. Doing so easescommand and control and logistics problems, esp ecially if the same crews and leaders are kepttogether for all tasks. But indi vidual shops are not always or ganized with the personnel, skills, orequipment to handle large scale or major multi-skill tasks. Consequently, BCEs must often combinethe capabilities from two or more shops, or flights, to respond adequately. Form a multi-shop team byselecting a lead shop to perform a task and augment that team from other shops when additional capa-bilities are needed. 86AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20084.4.6.  Each crisis drives dif ferent requirements. However, the response and recovery tasks requiredduring many crises are similar. Therefore, civil engineers can form relatively few teams to do commontasks. The process of building teams requires a unit to decide what situations to plan for, what tasks toperform for each situation, and what shops or multi-shop teams to assign to the tasks. 4.5.  Civil Engineer Response Teams. Many peacetime emergencies can be handled without formingmulti-shop teams, but a major natural  disaster, a major accident, or a ba se attack definitely requires spe-cial teams in addition to standard shop support. The following paragraphs outline three scenarios and sug-gest the types of teams to form in response to each  crisis. They are just exam ples and not meant to beall-inclusive. They are offered to help prepare for other crises that may be faced as well. The structure andpersonnel of the objective squadron are used for these examples. No distinction was made between mili-tary or civilian positions. In any shop, everyone must be able to do the assigned tasks. When appropriate,augmentees from the base augmenta tion duty program are us ed, especially the readiness support team.These scenarios do not apply to every base, so use what information applies and set aside the rest. Adjustthe proposed teams to fit local base requirements and resources, and include the details in the contingencyresponse plan (see Attachment 3). 4.6.  Bomb Threat. Any installation can be the target of a bomb threat. The EOC usually directs the baseresponse to bomb threats. Security forces and civil engineers play major roles. CE EOD forces render safeexplosive devices while other CE forces take actions to limit damage should a device explode. This threatcan involve a number of CE shops, but probably not the entire unit. This is a scenario that CE peacetimeorganization supports well. While the control center may be activated, no special multi-shop teams needto be formed. The CE response is outlined in Table 4.1. Additional details on other teams follow in Table4.2. Other CE shops may also be pl ayers in a bomb threat. For exampl e, the heavy repair element canbuild soil blast berms or place heavy  equipment to form blast barriers or traffic barricades. When othershops are called on, they can expect to perform tasks they commonly do or require no extra training. Suchtasks are identified on-scene and ca nnot be anticipated. Upon notification of a crisis, sharp shop leadersdecide which work crews or indivi duals they would dispatch if called upon and give  those individuals aheads-up. This last bit of common sense applies to every crisis. 4.7.  Major Natural Disaster. No matter its location, ever y base is vulnerable to  some form of naturaldisaster. In this scenario, reestablishing the flying mission may not  be the most immediate priority, theICC will provide guidance as to its relative priority. Support from off base or from other military units isavailable, but not necessarily in the local area. CE can assume facilities and utility systems are damagedacross the entire base. Such a disaster requires a base wide response, and that response is controlled fromthe EOC through unit contro l centers. This example is included to show how  an entire CE unit mightrespond to a situation that  can be supported  from the existing shops.  A few multi-shop teams may berequired. A logical assignment of functions to shops or teams is outlined in Table 4.1. Of course, an actualsituation can easily dictate adjustments to this list. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 200887Table 4.1.

Base Recovery Operations—Initial Response. This scenario applies to overseas bases that are subjectto a major enemy air attack. In this example, assume airfield pavements, facilities, and utility systems areextensively damaged. The damage prevents the aircraft from flying and hinders aircraft generation activ-ities. In the first few hours  after the attack, the overriding base priority is to get the aircraft flying again.The base-wide response is controlled from the EOC through unit control centers. Support from off-base orfrom other military units is not available. This requires the use of ADR equipment. Special teams must beformed within the CE organization to give priority to recovery actions that quickly restore the flying mis-sion. A listing of needed  teams is outlined in  Table 4.1. Because this effort is equipment intensive andthere are not enough heavy equipment operators to cover all pieces of equipment, many specialties mustlearn to operate equipment they do not normally use. Except for firefighting, this organizational arrange-ment covers a 12-hour shift. 4.9.  Thoughts on Organizing Teams. A few thoughts may help put the pr ocess of organizing responseteams into perspective. 4.9.1.  A unit can or ganize too much. It is so easy and tempting to  organize every response, but theresults become complicated and confusing; fight the urge and keep things simple. If it does not makesense to someone, it probably is not the best approach. 4.9.2.  Team members must be told what team they are on, where to report when called, what tools andequipment they are to bring, and who is in charge. 4.9.3.  Give a little extra attention to tasks that need quick team response, those that are not normallyperformed in the peacetime base O&M environment (things personnel have little experience with),and those that need extra training as a team to be effective. 4.9.4.  Be aware of dual tasking shops; it is only a problem if two jobs require accomplishment simul-taneously. 4.9.5.  If someone can perform a task, it does not matter if that person has the right AFSC or is in theright shop. 4.9.6.  A changing organizational structure is not a problem. Over the years, the CE organization haschanged a number of times in response to functional transformations and technology integration.Engineers still have the same missions to accomplish and the same skills available. It remains a matterof assigning the right tasks to the right shop, and augmenting as needed. 4.9.7.  There are no hard rules on organizing teams. Therefore, there is no right or wrong solutions; ifit works—use it. 4.10.  Augmenting Forces. Operations plans call for CONUS Prime BEEF  forces to deploy overseas insupport of deployed flying squadrons (Figure 4.3.). Upon arrival, a deployed Prime BEEF unit will aug-ment the in-place CE organization, if applicable. If the team is a follow Prime BEEF team, it will augmentthe lead team. Ideally, preparations for this augmentation begin well before the team arrives, in the case ofan in-place force. Vehicles and equipment need to be provided. Command and control relationships needto be worked out. To minimize the problems of integration, the augmenting Prime BEEF force is placedunder the operational control of the host BCE or lead team commander. 96AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure 4.3.  CE Organization with Augmenting Prime BEEF Units. 4.10.1.  This pamphlet and other documents consistently stress the value of team integrity and havingpersonnel work for the same leaders, even in changing situations. If that concept is good for the unit,it also applies to a Prime BEEF augmentation team.  When possible, they should maintain their unitintegrity. Task them through their representatives in the control  center in much the same way CEassigns tasks to their own forces. The augmenting unit commander then ensures those tasks are com-pleted. This approach, rather than total integration, is taken since the Prime BEEF team and host unitare organized and trained separately. As a result, individuals know th eir leaders, have learned theircoworker’s strengths and weaknesses, and have learned to work as a team . This cohesion results inmore efficient and better-controlled repair efforts. 4.10.2.  There should be sufficient commonality of training so that both units can work side-by-side torecover the base. On some tasks, the combined skills of both units will be required. In those circum-stances, a work crew/team from one unit should be detailed (loaned) to the other unit for a specifictask. When that task is complete, the loaned crew should return to the control of its parent unit, unlessthe crew is immediately reassigned to another joint task. 4.10.3.  Some recovery tasks require detailed knowledge of the host base, such as those involving theutility systems. When assigning those tasks to the augmenting unit, the host BCE should detail at leastone host unit expert to help each augmenting work crew. 4.10.4.  There are logical exceptions to this “rule.” Forces deploying as part of small UTCs will inte-grate with the lead Prime BEEF  team or the host USAF  civil engineer organization. Personnel fromthe same UTC can still be assigned to the same work crew to maintain some form of integrity. All fire-fighters will integrate with the USAF host or lead unit firefighters. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008974.10.5.  Not every Prime BEEF tea m deploys to a MOB. COBs of fer even greater possibilities forvariation since USAF units must integrate their  efforts with host nation forces. As a deploying unit,determine how things are or ganized and adjust to  the differences. Be sure to inform unit personnelwhat the adjustments are. 4.11.  Summary. Civil Engineers are major players in most crisis responses. Consequently, the unit mustanticipate what crises may be faced and what tasks to complete in order to provide adequate support to thebase and its mission. Then, assign those tasks to existing shops or special teams with the required skill toaccomplish the task at hand. 98AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Chapter 5  TRAINING 5.1.  Introduction. Plans can be perfect; equipment and supplies on-hand; the unit and response teams wellorganized, and yet not ready for war, military operations, or peacetime disasters. The unit must train forthose contingencies—mentally, physically, individually, and as a team. Unlike many units, such as aircraftmaintenance, civil engineers’ contingency tasks are not the same as t hose accomplished in the course ofeveryday work. Just as football teams have preseason practice to hone skills lost during the off-season andto incorporate new players, civil engineers must ha ve periodic practice to  develop and maintain skillsneeded to respond effectively to disasters, military operations, and war. Such training is inherently a unitresponsibility. Ideally, that training would be conducted entirely at home station, but the reality of limitedresources makes that impossible. Consequently, civil engineers must rely on home station training to pre-pare disaster responses and to develop basic skills for other contingencies. Both military and civilian per-sonnel must be involved. For trai ning on equipment not available at  home station, and for training insituations that cannot be recreated there, civil engineers mainly rely on training provided at one of the AirForce's Silver Flag sites and its associated exercise, which prepares key members of Prime BEEF teams toperform both force beddown and wartime base recovery tasks and assesses the success of training. Thereare other training opportunities for engineers, but these two pr ograms—Home Station Training and theSilver Flag—are the foundation for Air Force Civil Engineer contingency and disaster response training.While Air Force instructions prescribe contingency training requirements, the unit’s success in dealingwith a contingency or a disaster depends largely on how well it defines training needs, how often it trains,and how well it plans and executes. 5.2.  Overview. This chapter highlights CE contingency training requirements and demonstrates how indi-vidual training and the two foundation programs satisfy many of those requirements. Discussions includethe classroom topics of category I home station traini ng and the “hands-on” lessons of category II. Thereader is introduced to other unit training for disaster response and a “leadership training work center” toimprove leadership skills. Some special contingency courses are also mentioned. The target audience forthis chapter is the Readiness and Emer gency Management Flight staff, the unit officers, and anyonetasked to conduct unit level training. While tar geted to Prime BEEF units, the in formation is useful forRED HORSE squadrons as well. 5.3.  CE Training Requirements. “What training is mandated? What skills does the unit need? Where canthe unit find out what it should do?” These are the universal and logical questions everyone asks who hasever been assigned to train others. This section should help identify individual and team training require-ments for contingency and disaster responses. CE requirements are found in a number of Air Force publi-cations, where they are adequately described. Rather than repeat the details, they are highlighted here andtheir source documents identified. Some requirements, however, will result from planning rather thanfrom a publication. Most requirements  can be grouped in one of the foll owing seven categories: 1) indi-vidual specialty skills, 2) ancillary training, 3) wartime and other contingency tasks, 4) disaster responsetasks, 5) base orientation, 6) leadership, and 7) command and control. Unit orientation requirements couldbe incorporated into other sections in this paragraph, but are treated separately to give them visibility. Theactual training should be combined with in-processi ng activities and other training whenever possible.Deployed CE forces augmenting the unit also need this training and information. Make checklists to iden-tify points to cover with augmenting forces. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008995.3.1.  Individual Specialty Skills. Individual specialty skills are the basis for everything done by civilengineers. When individuals are well qualified, not only can they pe rform the routine tasks, but alsomore importantly, they can figure out work-around methods when standard procedures do not work.This ability to adapt is critical  for contingency and disaster res ponses, and it comes with improvedskills and experience. 5.3.1.1.  The skill requirements are found in th e Career Field Education and T raining Plan(CFETP) for each Air Force enlisted specialty. Part 2 of the CFETP contains the Specialty Train-ing Standard (STS) that outlines sp ecific core tasks that all pers onnel in that Air Force specialtyare required to perform, along  with other common skills routinely performed in the specialty . Ithighlights the required training  that each individual attending appr entice technical training mustreceive and indicates the minimum tasks that must be mastered to upgrade their skill level. Ideally,when individuals meet these standa rds, they will be able to per form when called on in a crisis.Experts in each specialty update  the required tasks in the CFETPs periodically, about every 3years. In addition to being familiar with the 32EX CFETP, each officer should quickly review allCE enlisted STSs at least once and preferably after each update. Mobility team leaders shouldknow what skills their pe rsonnel possess. If necessary, a craftsman in each  specialty can explainunfamiliar skills to team leaders and provide an evaluation of the overall state of proficiency of theteam. 5.3.1.2.  For US civilian employees, the performance requirements for CE trades can be found inthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Qu alification Standards. OPM standards do notapply to local-hire civilian employees at overseas bases, but similar performance requirements canbe found at the local Civilian Personnel Office. Individual job descriptions contain the most usefulinformation. 5.3.2.  Ancillary Training. The Air Force mandates a few training programs to ensure Air Force per-sonnel have certain knowledge and  skills that are not part of thei r specialty training. Civil engineersmust complete these ancillary  courses: Explosive Ordnance Reconnaissance (EOR) Course; Law ofArmed Conflict; Protection from Terrorism; and Self Aid and Buddy Care. There are other courses,but these deal with emergencies and contingencies. 5.3.3.  CE Wartime and Other Contingency Tasks. Skilled individuals are critical, but skilled teamsenable civil engineers to meet their war fighting and contingency responsibilities. Team requirementsare outlined in AFI 10-210. This instruction specifies tasks, team composition, and performance stan-dards. It covers basic wartime knowledge plus mobilization, expedient repair and destruction, expedi-ent field construction, expedient beddown, passive defense, base recovery, survivability support, fireand emergency services, readiness, and explosive  ordnance disposal tasks. The instruction tar getsPrime BEEF teams both stationed overseas and in CONUS. 5.3.4.  Disaster Response Tasks. AFI 10-2501 specifies mandatory training requirements to help pre-pare individuals and the base for peacetime disaster responses, wartime CBRNE defensive operations,and unit Readiness operations. Courses are presented to dif ferent groups on base to satisfy theserequirements. All military personnel and emer gency-essential civilians assigned to base level CivilEngineer units will receive Base Emergency Preparedness Orientation, Air Force Emergency Man-agement Program Planning and Operations, and quarterly informational updates to support the Emer-gency Management Installation Information Program . The quarterly informational updates keep thebase populace informed of seasonal hazards and protective actions; security and awareness measuresspecific to the installation; and types of attacks, major accidents, hazardous material incidents, and100AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008natural disasters most likely to occur at the installation. They also provide commanders an opportunityto update personnel on CBRNE related tasks and other procedures identified as needing improvementduring exercises and inspections. 5.3.5.  Emergency Response Training. Civil engineers must ensure that immediate response teams arewell trained. Areas include: fire and emergency services, readiness support for command and control,and hazardous material (HAZMAT) spills. HAZMAT response training requirements are extensiveand often require formal certification. See AFI 10-2501 for additional information on this subject. 5.3.6.  Base Orientation. Unlike most CE training requirements that  are relatively universal, a fewapply only to the base CE unit. There is no comprehensive list, but the following provide some exam-ples. 5.3.6.1.  Job assignments and responsibilities. 5.3.6.2.  Location of equipment. 5.3.6.3.  Location of supplies. 5.3.6.4.  Utility system isolation procedures. 5.3.6.5.  Priority units and facilities. 5.3.7.  Leadership. Effective leadership is the one universal and essential requirement a team, flight, orsquadron requires in order to meet its mission taskings. The more critical and time sensitive the tasks,the more important good leadership  becomes. Developing leadership skills can begin at school, butthose skills can only mature in the field. Junior officers are often in charge of Prime BEEF and REDHORSE teams and sent on deployments to “help” develop their skills. Some do well in such “tests byfire” and some do not. But in any situation, it is not fair to the team or the leader when he or she is notadequately prepared and trained. The structure of  the civil engineer squadron provides good leader-ship opportunities for a few officers, but not for all. Create opportunities at home station to help offic-ers and NCOs develop and practice their leadership  skills, especially those who are not currently inleadership positions. 5.3.7.1.  The focus should be on junior officers and NCOs to create a pool of experienced leaders.Begin by giving them challenging jobs in local exercises. Have them set up and conduct unit-train-ing programs or lead a squadron/unit bivouac. Form this group into teams and assign them a con-struction project to research, de sign, plan, order material, and buil d. Junior leaders need to learnhow to balance taking care of their troops and completing the mission on time. This can be accom-plished through ad hoc construction teams, or a more permanent  “leadership training work cen-ter.” The training opportunities are limited only by the unit’s imagination and the willingness to trynew things. 5.3.7.2.  Whatever challenge th e junior leaders are give n, they need to be told what their task orjob is to be and understand from their supervisor  or commander what is expected of them. Theyneed to be trained and then turned loose. Us e unit training and local ex ercises or constructionprojects to test them. Junior leaders need oversight and constructive feedback, more so at thebeginning and less as they gain experience. This  is not solely the job of the commander. A unit’ssenior officers and NCOs have an obligation to guide their juniors. There is nothing wrong with asenior NCO giving private counsel to a junior officer. Hopefully, junior officers will recognize thevalue and ask for such feedback. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20081015.3.7.3.  The commander must create the environment and set the tone for the senior leaders’ par-ticipation. It takes an ongoing co mmitment to train junior leadership, because new ones continu-ously join the unit. In the short term, it seems like a sacrifice to take the lieutenants away from thedrawing board and the junior NCOs out of the shops where they can be “productive.” But trainingthe next generation of leaders is a fundamental responsibility of all CE senior leaders. 5.3.8.  Command and Control. This is another requirement that could be incorporated into other cate-gories. Like leadership training, it is critical to the success of  the CE mission and requires emphasis.This section highlights just two training topics that  officers, senior NCOs, and key civilians need toprepare them to direct unit respon se effectively to crises, disasters, contingencies, war, or any othermilitary operation. 5.3.8.1.  OPLAN Familiarization.  Unit leaders must become fa miliar with operations plansrequirements (that affect the base), the In-Gar rison Expeditionary support plan, the CEMP 10-2,the CE Contingency Response Plan, hazardous material spill plans, and checklists that support theplans. Each leader should depart from familiarization sessions knowing what their section must doto support each plan. Review the list of plans in  Chapter 2. Before conducting those sessions,decide which plans are most important, not all need to be covered in one sitting. Prepare well forthese sessions, short handouts and enthusiastic pres entations will speed the learning process andhelp everyone focus. 5.3.8.2.  Control Center Familiarization. Personnel working in  the CE Control Centers (damagecontrol center, FACC, etc.) or the EOC must be come familiar with the la yout and resources intheir control center. They should know what sources of information are available and how to usethe communications equipment. 5.3.8.3.  Common Sense Requirements. Remember , the common sense ap proach to trainingrequirements always applies. If the unit has to plan for something, then train for it. If not mandatedin writing, but the task is a known requirement, train for it anyway. 5.4.  Individual Training. Home station and Silver Flag training may be  the foundation for CE contin-gency responses, but individual specialty skills remain the bedrock. Air Education and T raining Com-mand (AETC) teaches basic skills to enlisted military  personnel before they report to their first dutystation, but these airmen do not arrive fully qualified in all tasks. Using the football team analogy again,airmen come to the team with basic skills, but they need to improve  on those skills to be ef fective teamplayers. Each Airman will improve their skills through on-the-job (OJT) training, career developmentcourses (CDC), and contingency training. Qualification Training Packages (QTP) and other multi-mediaproducts are used for upgrade and refr esher training. Civilian employees also come to the job with man-datory minimum skills and can improve their skills on  the job. Just as with the military, they may attendAETC courses to acquire additional skills. 5.4.1.  Demand Quality On-the-Job Training. Most supervisors do a good job with OJT. However, ifindividuals from a shop consistently cannot perform a required task, the OJT program in that shop isprobably weak. Use senior NCOs to find and fix these type problems. Occasionally, some supervisorsare willing to pencil whip requirements to “help” a friend or make their records look good. That prac-tice is illegal and it is unfair to Airmen who study and train hard to earn their upgrade. It also misleadsthe commander and the unit about its capabilities. If someone arrives in the unit who is unqualified toperform a needed task, return them to training stat us, even if the Airman was previously qualified.Otherwise, under-qualified Airmen may be put unknowingly in charge of a task. 102AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20085.4.2.  Set Up a Study Center. Many units have already done this in the fire department and some in aseparate training section. Make it comfortable an d attractive. Fill it with current study materialsincluding CDCs, videos, computer programs, etc. Provide more than one videocassette recorder(VCR) or digital videodisk (DVD) player to support multiple training activities simultaneously. Inter-net connectivity is a must now that many training programs are now web-based. Keep the study centerquiet by utilizing headphones when  possible to keep the noise leve ls down. Since multi-media com-puter based training is a valuable training tool, add fast computers (with a lot of memory) to the studycenter and begin with at least tw o. Attempt to keep the study cent er open during other than normalduty hours. This will require e xperimentation with the hours to  determine when Airmen are bestserved. Since all shops benefit,  share the manpower burden to k eep the study center open amongshops. Rather than operating the study center via a duty roster, designate Airmen for a 3- to 6-month“tour” to keep it open  during the non-duty hours. Train the designated attendants so they can teachothers how to use the equipment, know where to look for requested study materials, and know the pro-cedures to loan materials. Rotate the attendants so the same ones do not always get stuck with the leastdesirable hours. The usefulness of the study center will increase as the category I home station train-ing program evolves and other mult i-media training is added, such  as Qualification Training Pack-ages. 5.4.3.  Encourage Officer and Enlisted Professional Reading. There is no career development coursefor CE officers, but that does not diminish their  obligation to develop their contingency skills. Eachofficer should make a personal commitment to thoroughly read each of the volumes in this pamphletseries before he or she completes  two years of service. This obligation also extends to reviewing thereferenced documents and learning what information they contain. Likewise, they should make it ahabit to read books on le adership and wartime conduct. Although, the focu s above is on the of ficerprofessional reading, the professional NCO should also be encouraged to read similar books that willhelp them expand their skills and ability to provide solid NCO leadership. 5.5.  Home Station Training. Home station is the primary place to develop basic skills the unit requires formilitary operations and disaster responses in war and  peace. Some home station training is mandated,other elements are not, but all are intended to build  capable teams. Home station training is extremelyimportant. For 70 percent of the Pr ime BEEF team, this may be the only contingency training they willreceive. This section explores  six HST programs: Category I “c lassroom” training, Category II“hands-on” training, ancillary training, installation emergency management training, other unit trainingand exercises, and base exercises. AFI 10-210 is the source document for CE contingency training. 5.5.1.  Category I Training. “CAT I” knowledge-level training provides the baseline information engi-neers need to perform contingency tasks as a team. The gained knowledge prepares Airmen for Cate-gory II hands-on training and is an important prerequisite for Silver Flag Exercise activities. CategoryI training takes on added importance when it is the only method to expose engineers to a task when theunit does not have the needed equipment or res ources for hands-on training. Personnel assigned tobase level Civil Engineer units will receive initial and refresher training in all CAT I topics as shownin AFI 10-210, Attachment 2. Initial or recurring CAT I training can be satisfied by completing eitherunit classroom training, the General Continge ncy Responsibilities CD-ROM (GCRCD), orWeb-based courses available on the CE Virtual Learning Center (VLC) website. See AFI 10-210 formore details on CAT I training options. 5.5.2.  A synopsis of the CAT I training program follows. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20081035.5.2.1.  Prime BEEF Orientation/General Contingency. Upon assignment to the unit, train all mil-itary and emergency-essential civilian employees on the unit’s Prime BEEF and Emergency Man-agement missions. Emphasize the individual’s role and how it contributes to the program. Includean overview of Civil Engineer Doctrine and explain the organization, training, equipment, operat-ing concepts, and contingency missions pertaining to the unit.  The Prime BEEF manager willupdate unit personnel on sign ificant changes to the programs as  they occur. This sub-categorytraining also includes general contingency skills such as Enemy Prisoner of War Handling, AORSpecific General Orders, Operations Security, and CBRNE Defense Awareness Training. 5.5.2.2.  Combat Skills. Provide CE leadership and their personnel combat skills training, such asTroop Leading Procedures, Convoy Ops, Land Navigation and Ma p Reading, Air Base Defense,Work Party Security, Team Movement Techniques, Operating in a Joint Environment, and Use ofNight Vision Goggles. 5.5.2.3.  Field Sanitation and Heal th Training. This training includes Problems of Extreme Cli-mates and Field Sanitation and Personal Hygiene. 5.5.2.4.  Expedient Methods. Expedient methods trai ning will address three areas: Force Bed-down, Field Construction, and Repair Methods. 5.5.2.4.1.  Force Beddown. Force beddown subjects will include information on BEAR assetsas well as package configurations and pla ybook options. Lessons should cover items such asenvironmental protection; bare base layout; BEAR water, mechanical, and electrical utilitysystems; wartime construction management; and resource dispersal. 5.5.2.4.2.  Field Construction. Fi eld construction includes information on facility hardeningand construction of field latrines, berms, and dikes. 5.5.2.4.3.  Repair Methods. Re pair methods will include te chniques for DCC command andcontrol, minimum essential restoration of damaged facilities or utility systems including elec-trical, plumbing, road, and buildi ng repairs; shoring and scabbi ng; and war damage repair tothe airfield, facilities, and utilities). 5.5.2.5.  Emergency Management and CBRN Response. This training is tar geted towards Emer-gency Management personnel and covers CBRN Cell Operations and HAZMAT Awareness Level1 and 2 Certification. 5.5.2.6.  Force Protection. Force protection w ill introduce military Prime  BEEF members to theconcepts of military vehicle ope rator training, personal and work  party security, revetments, andobstacles. 5.5.3.  Category II Training. The ideal training method is for the trai nee to physically perform a taskand repeat it until becoming proficient—“hands-on” is the thrust of category II training. Make everyeffort to incorporate realism into CAT II training programs. Use field gear (to include primary weap-ons) as the “norm” rather than the exception whenever training on topics such as personal/work partysecurity, convoy operations, defensive fighting posi tions, etc. Category II topics are highlighted inAFI 10-210, Attachment 3. To help guide CAT II training efforts, lesson plans for each task have beendeveloped and posted on the AFCESA website at  https://wwwmil.afcesa.af.mil/Directorate/CEX/CEXX/ContingencyTrng/HST_LessonPlans.asp. Use of these lesson plans is mandatory and wil lhelp assure continuity of trai ning throughout the entire CE comm unity. If a new topic is added,develop an in-house plan until the standard plan becomes available on the website. Often, the unit can104AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008combine the training of many tasks into a single training period. On the other hand, complex tasks, orthose that require a lot of person nel, can be broken down into sub-tasks. Frequently, it is helpful totrain smaller size crews in the sub-tasks before attempting to train an  entire crew or team in the fulltask. With few exceptions, results will be better when training personnel in small groups of 10 to 15.Category II training is mandatory for CE personnel, but it can still be fun. It takes more effort to set upsuch a training program, but it is worth it. Train Airmen well the first time, they will require less fre-quent refresher training and those refresher sessions will be faster. Some observations concerning thegeneral category II topics follow. 5.5.3.1.  Government Vehicle and Equipment Operations Training. Airfield damage repair in ahigh threat environment requires many vehicles moving at the same  time to make the neededrepairs. In that situation, a t ypical CE unit has too few heavy eq uipment operators. To solve thisshortfall, civil engineers must train other individuals in the unit to  operate selected vehicles. AFI10-210, Table 4.4, outlines the requirements. Overs eas bases should have little trouble meetingthese requirements if they have the equipm ent on-hand. CONUS Prime BEEF units have a hugechallenge without the equipment. Consequently, train with what is available to the unit and borrowitems from other bases if possibl e. Units may also send person nel to the Regional EquipmentOperator Training Sites. 5.5.3.2.  Unit CBRNE Defense Training. Basic CBRNE training is provided through the Installa-tion EM Training Program as outlined in table 6.3 and para graphs 6.6.1.2 and 6.6.1.3 of AFI10-2501. However, additional unit training is required to gain proficiency. This includes task qual-ification training, equipment and large area decontamination training, shelter management train-ing for selected individuals, and training to process in and ou t of a toxic free area. Each unit isrequired to ensure its personnel can perform their  wartime roles in a chemical or biological war-fare environment. For civil engineers, this means base recovery activities. Overseas bases have theadvantage again because they have the equipment available. The biggest need is for personnel toexperience the physical limitations they face when  performing base recovery activities in chemi-cal warfare defense ensembles. During task qualification training, practice equipment decontami-nation and shelter in- and out-processing; a shelter is not required to practice these steps. Open aircontamination control area processing can be pe rformed. Spray personnel and equipment with atelltale chemical before they decontaminate equipment or themselves. Under an ultraviolet light,the absence of the telltale chemical reveals whether or not if the decontamination efforts were suc-cessful. 5.5.3.3.  Field Health. All Prime BEEF personnel will complete hands-on training in Self-Aid andBuddy Care training and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) certification. 5.5.3.4.  Expedient Methods (Be ddown). To maximize training opportunities, include some ofthese tasks in base exercises as well as durin g regular unit training. Tasks in this area includeTEMPER tent and small shelter system erection, preway heater  set up, and generator set opera-tions. Unfortunately many of the assets are not available at home  station. To compensate for thisshortfall, emphasize the information learned in category I training and make  sure the personnelwho attend the Silver Flag Exercise become “experts.” 5.5.3.5.  Weapon Skills. All military Prime BEEF personnel assigned  to a UTC will qualify withtheir primary duty weapon. E nsure individuals performing courier, guard, in-flight security, firechief, or similar duties are trai ned to fire the pistol. Individua ls assigned to Prime BEEF deploy-able and associated UTCs are included in arming Group B and will train to that frequency. Excep-AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008105tion: Personnel in DXX coded s tandard deployable UTCs and in AXX  coded associated UTCswill receive “just-in-time” training. Getting quotas can be a problem, especially for units that donot have a small arms range on base. Freque nt communications and good working relationshipwith the Security Forces Squadron combat arms training (CATM) flight will eliminate most prob-lems. 5.5.3.6.  Combat Skills.  In addition to weapons handling proficiency, Combat Skills trainingemphasizes command, control, and communications procedures; land navigation and map read-ing; individual/team movement techniques and combat organization; troop leading procedures;and construction of defensive positions. T rain military Prime BEEF members on personal andwork party security; night operations; convoy operations, and air base defense operations. Includedefensive combat skills that could be required while performing contingency tasks. 5.5.3.6.1.  Defensive combat skills and work party security training should concentrate on thebasics: detection methods, sign/countersign measures, rules of engagement, and reporting pro-cedures. Training in command, control, communications, and signals is especially important. 5.5.3.6.1.1.  Find out if, how , and when Security Forces will pl an to use CE in airbasedefense operations and train for those roles. Security for convoy operations is also impor-tant. Lessons learned indicate  that civil engineers often find  themselves providing theirown convoy security. 5.5.3.6.1.2.  Civil engineers are weapons-limited, with RED HORSE being the exception.CE has no crew served weapons (like M-60 mach ine guns), mortars, grenades, etc. With-out those items, personnel are limited to hunke ring down, calling for  help, and returningfire as best they can when attacked. Make sure personnel know how to do those threethings effectively. Trainees should be able to answer the  following seven questions whentrained: 1) What do I do first? 2) How do  I quickly determine th e source of attack? 3)Where am I supposed to shoot? 4) What signals do I use? 5) How do I keep from shootingfriendly units coming to help us? 6) Who do I call for help and by what means? 7) What doI do if receiving indirect fire? 5.5.3.6.1.3.  Passive defense measures should include topics such as camouflage, resourcedispersal, expedient hardening, blackout procedures, etc. 5.5.3.6.1.4.  It takes considerable training to perform security roles well, but there is onlylimited category II training time available. Obviously, the time spent on security comes atthe expense of other training, so the better-trained personnel are the first time will decreasethe time required for refresher training. 5.5.3.7.  Field Training Exercise (FTX). The annual field training is  an opportunity to devote alltime to contingency training. Rather than training on individual topics, it is a time to tie many ofthem together. Each Airman assigned to the UTCs listed in AFI 10-210, Attachment 3, must par-ticipate in a continuous 4 day FTX/bivouac once every 20 months (40 months for AFRC and ANGunits). Exceptions: (1) A MAJCOM Civil Engineer may reduce/waive this field training require-ment for those UTC-tasked units not having 4 FPE* and 4F9E* UTCs assigned. (2) T o satisfyunique ANG/AFRC requirements, the applicable  ANG/AFRC Civil Engineer may allow unitcommanders to divide the 4 day requirement into two sessions. If divided, only one session mustinclude a bivouac. However, units can elect to set up an encampment each session as needed. AFI10-210 identifies the mandatory and optional items to include in the FTX. 106AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20085.5.3.7.1.  The FTX mus t include command, control, and communications; CBRNE defenseactions; unit beddown; self aid/buddy care; and field sanitation. Unique combat skills trainingsuch as individual and team movement techniques, troop leading procedures, land navigationand map reading, weapons handling and qualification, convoy operations, work party security,first aid firefighting and fire prevention, airb ase defense, and night operations must also beincorporated into the FTX. 5.5.3.7.2.  Additional training may include vehicle operations; personnel alert and recall pro-cedures; deployment processing; equipment marshaling; pallet buildup procedures; hazardousmaterials preparation training; camp layout; erection of available bare base assets; EOR; expe-dient methods; appropriate multiskill training; plus any topic a unit wants to inject to make thetraining more effective. When applicable, Mission Essential Equipment Training should alsobe completed during the FTX. 5.5.3.7.3.  Split the unit  up for field training  if possible. Training will be better; less timewasted, and more individuals will receive leadership experience. Place a different officer andNCO in charge of each group and provide them the training objective. Make them responsiblefor planning/conducting the training and arranging for support. 5.5.3.7.4.  Allowance Standard 429 provides the Home S tation Training Set used to conductthe FTX. Consider joint training with services, security police, and other support forces. Theirparticipation adds realism and builds good working relationships. 5.5.4.  Ancillary Training. All ancillary training can be taught separate ly, but some topics are easilyincorporated into category I and II training. E xplosive ordnance reconnaissance and self-aid andbuddy care are examples. This trai ning can easily be included in  field training as well. OperationsSecurity (OPSEC) and Communications Security (COMSEC) are classroom activities, but have a“hands-on” application. 5.5.5.  Installation Emergency Management Training. This important training currently covers the fol-lowing courses: CBRNE Defense (Orientation, Awareness, Survival Skills, Functional Area TaskQualification Training, and Key Leaders) Courses; Contamination Control Area Management andOperations Course, Post-Attack Reconnaissance Course, Unit Control Center Operations Course,Emergency Response Operations Course, Readin ess Support Team Course, Shelter ManagementTeam Course, Contamination Control Team Course, Exercise Evaluation Team Course, Unit EM Rep-resentative Course, Base Emergency Preparedness Orientation, and Air Force Incident ManagementCourse. Civil engineers provide this training for  the entire base. These courses are presented usingstandardized lessons that are adjusted to meet local conditions and threats. See AFI 10-2501 for addi-tional guidance. 5.5.6.  Other Unit Training. There are other training requirements  civil engineers should perform.These tend to be base unique requirements that do not fit well into other categories. 5.5.6.1.  Physical Fitness. Engin eers must be in good physical  condition to handle the strenuoustasks inherent in contingency operations. Good  physical conditioning is important to CE readi-ness. FES and EOD technicians have had a physical  conditioning program for years. In fact, theFES program was the model for the Air Force. Physical conditioning is a personal responsibility,but CE units can help by emphasizing the value  of physical conditioning. One way is to conductweekly physical training sessions, as many units currently do. Consider asking the Services unit tohelp develop a unit or individua l fitness program. Physical fitness is im portant in contingenciesAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008107and battle. A person can  endure the stresses of battle better and long er—physically and men-tally—when the body is fit. 5.5.6.2.  Unit Orientation. Individuals should be oriented to the base during in-processing and thefirst few weeks on the job; a number of topics should be covered. 5.5.6.2.1.  Job Assignments and Responsibilities. Each individual needs and deserves to knowwhat tasks they could be asked to perform in a contingency or disaster. If an Airman has a spe-cific job during a contingency, he or she needs to know what it is, what the responsibilities are,and where to report. Everyone needs to practice or walk through his or her tasks at least once.Do not forget the jobs that backup someone else. 5.5.6.2.2.  Location of E quipment. Engineers need to know  what equipment is available,where it is located, and how to operate each item. They need to know how to get the equipmentand where to find the keys. 5.5.6.2.3.  Location of Supplies. Show new personne l what supplies are available and wherethey are located. Explain the procedures to get the materials. 5.5.6.2.4.  Utility System Isolation Procedures. Utilities personnel need to know how to isolatewater and electrical systems. They need to know where main water shut off valves are located,where circuits can be k illed, etc. They need  to know any special safe ty considerations. Thisinformation should be included in the CE Cont ingency Response Plan, but it must be passedalong and practiced. This information is often needed for da y-to-day activities, but occasion-ally one sees the knowledge residing with only one or two individuals. It will stay that way ifthe knowledge is viewed as job security . Superintendents and element leaders must beinvolved to overcome such a situation. 5.5.6.2.5.  Priority Units. Some units on base, by the nature of their mission, enjoy a high pri-ority and deserve more urgent attention when they call for CE  help. This knowledge is notself-evident. Be sure all CE personnel understand which facilities get priority attention. 5.5.6.2.6.  Recall Procedures. Brief individuals on recall procedures and explain their respon-sibilities to contact others. 5.5.6.2.7.  Alarm Signals. Individuals need to know what the local  alarm signals mean andwhat they should do when  they hear a signal. This is especially true at overseas locationswhere alarm signals and meanings can vary because of agreements with host nations. 5.5.6.2.8.  The natural inclination is to assume base-unique  training “automatically” takesplace. The shop foremen or NCOICs usually do it well. Make sure good base-unique trainingoccurs by encouraging each shop chief to incorporate contingency related requirements intohis or her newcomer ’s orientation checklist. Checklists can be useful for orienting the moresenior individuals when they a rrive as well. Some orientation  activities such as learning thelocation of valves should be hands-on. This re duces problems such as finding a valve for thefirst time at night with only a base utility map to help locate the valve. 5.5.6.3.  OPLAN Reviews and Exerci se Preparation. Do not wait fo r base-wide exercises to seehow well the unit can respond to disas ters and contingencies. CE units should periodically runtheir own OPLAN reviews and pre-exercise drills. These reviews and drills can be accomplishedto get the unit ready for a specif ic base-wide exercise or to make sure the unit is prepared for108AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008actual contingencies. The emphasis should be on command, control, and communications—that iswhere units tend to have the most problems. 5.5.6.3.1.  Everyone who leads a res ponse team should be involved.  This is their best chanceto learn what their teams may be called upon to perform. They can then decide what they mustdo to get their teams ready . The number two person on each te am should also be involved.Some might argue the experienced unit leaders who have been around for some time are wast-ing their time—not true. Since they have “heard and seen it all before,” their insights can helpeducate new personnel. 5.5.6.3.2.  OPLAN reviews and ex ercise preparations can  be conducted as briefings,talk-through sessions, walk-through drills, command post exer cises (CPX), and full up unitexercises. All have their advantages and all have essentially the same purpose: get Airmeninformed so they know how and when to res pond. Briefing the entire unit consumes a lot ofman-hours, but everyone hears the same message and it can minimize rumors. It can also be amorale booster if done well, but the unit may want to reserve this for major inspections. Thesesessions are good opportunities for the participan ts to “talk through”  an OPLAN or exerciseand resolve support problems. Use the checklists  for the plan being reviewed and find out ifthey are adequate. When the session ends, the pa rticipants should understand what is to bedone, by whom, and in  what sequence. Work out task timing and hi ghlight critical supportrequirements. Ask each leader to list what his or her team or shop must do to get ready, to setthe dates he or she plans to have all preparations complete, and to identify all limiting factorsand capability shortfalls. As individuals become more experienced, these sessions can be com-pleted faster. 5.5.6.3.3.  Sometimes, more than talk is needed. A walk-through, talk-through drill in the fieldhelps individuals see what they must do and what resources they have. With these drills, indi-viduals actually step through the tasks in order. Speed is secondary to learning the what, who,when, where, how, why, and in what sequence. A walk-through is helpful to train new person-nel; to teach complex ta sks; to de-conflict activities that involve a  lot of personnel whoseefforts could easily interfere with each other; to resolve timing problems; and to help person-nel sitting in control center jobs to understa nd what happens in the field. A walk-through caninvolve a few, or all leaders, or target specific crews or teams that may be having problems. 5.5.6.3.4.  A unit CPX in the CE control center (or Damage Control Center) can help fix com-mand and control problems without impacting the workforce. These sessions are beneficial toget new personnel and augmentees familiar with facilities and their job in the control center. ACPX allows participants to develop communi cation and COMSEC procedures, work out theflow of information, and gain experience in  making base recovery  and resource allocationdecisions in a hectic environm ent. Any other CE control locat ions can be added into theseexercises, such as the FES alarm room. 5.5.6.3.5.  Conduct unit exercises when unit personnel know what to do but need practice to doit well. Frequently, complex tasks must be repeated to get the timing right. A unit can waste alot of valuable time on exercises if personnel and leaders are not prepared. Use a combinationof these pre-exercise activities. For example,  start with a talk through  with the leaders. Havewalkthroughs with a selected team or teams. Then conduct a limited unit exercise. Very rarelydoes every section and shop need to get involved. The exception might be for an ADR or baserecovery after attack practice at an overseas base. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20081095.5.6.3.6.  Adequate exercise preparations will enable CE  leaders to answer the followingquestions at a minimum: 5.5.6.3.6.1.  What is supposed to happen? 5.5.6.3.6.2.  What am I expected to do? 5.5.6.3.6.3.  What resources—personnel and equipment—do I have to work with? 5.5.6.3.6.4.  What do my teams and I have to do to get ready? 5.5.6.3.6.5.  Who supports me? 5.5.6.3.6.6.  Who is my boss? 5.5.6.3.6.7.  How am I to communicate? By messenger, phone, radios? And with who? Arethere any codes? 5.5.6.3.6.8.  Are there any special rules to follow? 5.5.6.4.  Certification Training. Be aware that some  CE specialties must be specially trained andcertified to perform certain tasks. This is especially true in FES, EOD, barr ier maintenance, andutilities shops. Learn what tasks require certifi cation. For example, the unit does not want todeploy to a bare base, install a mobile aircraft arresting system (MAAS), and find out that there isno one qualified to certify that th e MAAS is ready to catch plan es. Firefighters and others in theunit must be certified on some  HAZMAT tasks. The best way to find out about certificationrequirements is to ask each shop foreman. Share that information with all CE officers. 5.5.6.5.  War Stories. Invite individuals that have b een on real-world deployments to relate theirexperiences, share their lessons learned, identify the problems they encountered, and the solutionsthey developed. “War stories” are an invaluable and interesting way to expose junior troops to thepotential problems they may enco unter. Find the individuals in th e unit with interesting deploy-ment experiences. Invite individuals from other base units that  can offer different perspectives.Experiences can be shared with the entire unit or targeted to the personnel in a shop or on a team. 5.5.6.6.  CE Officer’s Call. A periodic gathering of the unit’s officers can be used to help preparethem for their leadership responsibilities. Topics can come from daily e xperiences, home stationfield training, or Prime BEEF deployments—alm ost any topic is valid. Successes and failuresshould be highlighted. Getting individuals to talk about their fa ilures can be tough, but those areoften the most useful stories. Officer development should be the focus,  but attendance does nothave to be limited to officers. Civilians, and especially senior NCOs, can contribute to and learnfrom the discussions. Shop visits can be a good Officer’s Call activity. Periodically, have the offic-ers visit a different shop. Each flight chief or shop foreman should give a tour and highlight shopcapabilities, limitations, and the biggest challenge he or she faces. Be sure to look at all utility sys-tems. Also, visit the EOD, FES, and readiness fl ights. These visits help officers know who is incharge of each flight or shop and help them to  understand the unique f eatures of their unit andbase. 5.5.6.7.  Augmentee/Unit Integration Training. Augmentees, whether individuals or members ofPrime BEEF teams, require training to effectively support the unit. Readiness Support Team aug-mentees are trained through the formal cours e presented in the installation EM training. Ideally ,EOD augmentees get recurring training one to two days per month,  but they can also get a cra shcourse when hostilities threaten. Prime BEEF, or other teams, that deploy to the base must get area110AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008and base familiarization training. They may also require base-unique task training. Identify thesetraining needs in advance and acquire or develop lesson plans for them. Include training require-ments and list responsibility for conducting that  training in the contingency response plan. Theunit must determine the timing, content, and frequency of augmentee training. 5.5.7.  Base Exercises. Civil engineers do not respond to disasters and contingencies alone, but as partof a base team. To be effective, that team must periodically practice integrated responses to peacetimedisasters and wartime attacks through base wide exercises. Such exercises help engineers get familiarwith support they must provide to others, and highlight the support civil engineers need from others.Engineers must be willing and cooperative players.  More information on base exercises and evalua-tions will be covered in the next chapter. 5.5.8.  Annual Training Schedule. To provide visibility and control to home station training, each unitshould prepare an annual expeditionary training schedule. It does not have to be complicated. The keyis to pick tasks that the unit most needs and has the resources to perform. Next, determine how muchtime is needed to train each task and which  ones can be grouped together. Identify prerequisite train-ing for each task, because those must be scheduled first—then create the schedule. Some may arguethat with all the external demands on CE, a schedule cannot be kept. The counter argument is with allthe external demands; a schedule is needed to help meet all commitments. The schedule certainly canbe changed, but follow it as closel y as possible. This pr events having to go  through all the work ofcanceling and rescheduling support from others. 5.6.  Silver Flag. The Silver Flag prog ram is essential to civil engine er readiness training. Many contin-gency tasks simply cannot be trained at home station. For example, few bases have sufficient real estate,mission flexibility, or equipment to explode holes repeatedly in the runway to allow the Prime BEEF teamto practice airfield damage repair. Neither do civil engineer units have mobile facilities and utility systemsto practice setting up a bare base. Silver Flag Exercise sites are free of many or all of those home stationconstraints and resource limitations. 5.6.1.  The program provides intensive, hands-on  team training and certification for Prime BEEFteams in traditional engineer skills, as well as in FES, EM and EOD skills. A number of core person-nel on each Prime BEEF team train in special ta sks required to support air  operations anytime, any-where. These core personnel then lead and train their teammates during those contingency operations.The team task certification is an important tool to demonstrate the training readiness of the mobile CEforce. 5.6.2.  The curriculum focuses on preparing crews (versus individuals) to perform both beddown andbase recovery tasks. Trainees are grouped by functional area (technical specialty) into crews for spe-cialized training, task evaluation, and certification. Most traine es participate in a multi-skill baserecovery or beddown exercise at the end of the trai ning period to allow students to see the “big pic-ture” when beddown and base recovery activities require participation from many specialties. 5.6.3.  During task evaluations, trainees must successfully perform the major tasks listed for their spe-cialty. Because Silver Flag is important to Air Force Civil Engineer readiness, each Prime BEEF unitrecords successful completion of Silver Flag training in its SORTS report. AFI 10-210 provides crite-ria for MAJCOM Civil Engineers to grant CAT III training to units under specific circumstances. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20081115.6.4.  Silver Flag activities depe nd on adequate home station prep aration. Those requirements aredetailed in a predeployment information package  the training cadre sends to  each unit weeks be forethe unit deploys. 5.6.5.  Silver Flag training is not intended to be a one-time effort. The inability to practice many con-tingency tasks at home station dr ives the need for the core members of each Prime BEEF team toreturn to the Silver Flag site at least once every AEF cycle. 5.7.  Special Training Programs. There are other training opportunities to consider. 5.7.1.  Regional Equipment Operator Training Site (REOTS). REOTS is operated by the Air NationalGuard’s 201st RED HORSE Flight  at Ft. Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, and provides an intensiveweeklong course of initial and re fresher training to CE heavy equi pment operators. Its purpose is toelevate equipment operator proficiency on wartime tasks. The students train on four key airfield dam-age repair vehicles: excavator, 4CY front-end loader, grader, and dozer. Active force 3E2X1 personnelshould attend the REOTS course shortly after attaining the 5-skill level. Reserve component personnelmust attend the REOTS course every 3 years. The course is available to active duty personnel as wellas Guard and Reserve engineers. Each unit must pay trainee travel and per diem. See the course detailsin the AF Education and T raining Course Announcement located at  https://etca.randolph.af.mil inthe HQ AFCESA section. Units request course quotas through respective MAJCOMs. 5.7.2.  Expeditionary Combat Support-Training and Certification Center (ECS-TCC). The ECS-TCCat Dobbins ARB GA has a certified cadre that administers contingency training to strengthen CE corecompetencies. Task certification/re-certification, refresher, upgrade and just in time (in support ofcontingency requirements) training is this site’s primary focus. Students receive individual hands-onwar and contingency skills training. The cadre in structs core and diamond task items from theCFETPs on equipment and procedures not available at home station for 3-, 5-, and 7-level personnel,and provides CAT III preparation for UTCs and individuals. The site has mission essential equipmentto include Mobile Aircraft Arresting System (MAAS), Emergency Airfield Lighting System (EALS),Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU), and mission support equipment to include theContingency Airfield Marking System (paint striper), and Field Deployable Environmental ControlUnits (FDECUs). Beddown and sustainment equipment training includes bare base facilities setup andreconstitution, data collection and surveying using equipment and components from the EngineeringGIS package, and mobile hydraulic crane certification and training  up to a 50-ton capacity . TheECS-TCC also partners with local fire departments and offers proficiency training in live fire applica-tions, drivers training, and MAAS rewind operations. Note: EOD and REOTS training is not adminis-tered at this site. 5.7.3.  AETC Specialized Courses. AETC occasionally offers specialized courses that are tied to con-tingency training. Quotas can be di fficult to get for these courses,  because CE competes for limitedfunding with other Air Fo rce functional areas. Let the unit’ s voice be heard when requesting quotasfrom the MAJCOM. Just as with  REOTS, course details are located in the ETCA. Examples are thecourses that cover bare base systems such as Bare Base Power Generation (Diesel), Bare Base Electri-cal Systems, Bare Base Water Purification and Distribution System,  and Bare Base Structures Erec-tion course (this course can be delivered to the un it for just two course quot as making it a very costeffective means to practically train the entire unit). 5.7.4.  USAFE and PACAF Courses. HQ USAFE and HQ  PACAF offer theater specific versions ofthe Silver Flag curriculum for theater CE units. This training is presented by the 38 Construction and112AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Training Squadron at Ramstein AB, Germany, and by Det 1, 554 RED HORSE  Silver Flag ExerciseSite at Kadena AB, Japan. The P ACAF site sends a mobile tr aining team to some of its bases topresent selected contingency lessons. Each MAJCOM schedules its units. 5.8.  Ideas about CE Contingency Training. Some random but use ful ideas to help develop the trainingprogram follow: 5.8.1.  Pick training emphasis each year by deciding what capabilities are most important for the unit.Make sure the unit can do  those things well  and then work on eliminating  weak points. If there aremany, decide which is most important and work it first. 5.8.2.  Set training objectives for each lesson to in clude what must be done, what skills are needed,and who should be trained. 5.8.3.  There are not enough pe rsonnel in the Readiness and Emer gency Management Flight to planand conduct all required category II training. Use other individuals in the unit and select them early sothey have time to study th eir lessons. Consider dividing a Prime B EEF team into four to six groups.Put an officer and senior NCO in charge of each group for contingency training. At the beginning ofthe year, tell them what topics they need to cove r and give them an annual schedule. They are to betotally responsible for planning and conducting th e training for their group and should arrange theirown logistical support. They can use experts to help present some of the lessons. They should use thestandardized Prime BEEF lesson plans provided by HQ AFCESA/CEXX. 5.8.4.  Good instructor preparation is essential. The best instructors are the ones who are excited abouttraining. Occasionally ask the commander to visit a class for a short while—this gives a big boost tothe instructor and demonstrates to the class that the commander is serious about contingency training. 5.8.5.  Train on the difficult things also, not just the easy stuff. 5.8.6.  Training should build on previous lessons. 5.8.7.  Timing tasks and complex tasks need more training, more frequently. 5.8.8.  Train by shop when possible; it makes sense to  do so. This is more likely when tasks areassigned to specific shops as discussed in Chapter 6. 5.8.9.  Performance, not talk, is the measure of capability. Have personnel demonstrate how well theycan perform the job. Periodically and randomly ask individuals in the unit to explain their duties andtheir shop’s mission in a particul ar contingency. If the individual cannot sufficiently convey theresponsibilities, advise their supervisor that the individual requires training. If this is common in oneshop, the supervisor is either not doing his or her job or needs training themselves. 5.8.10.  Ensure that at least one expert is on the team for each contingency task. 5.8.11.  Trainers should train their replacements. 5.8.12.  To get the most out of Silver  Flag training, ensure individuals complete prerequisite trainingbefore deploying. 5.9.  Summary. Training occurs on three levels: individual, unit, and  integrated with other base units.Training should be realistic and conducted as inte nded to fight. Having enough time and resources forcontingency training is a historical problem. When a threat is not imminent, training is less emphasized.Yet, with a worldwide mobility commitment a nd peacetime disasters always possible, civil engineer sAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008113must always be ready to respond. Often, the biggest obstacle comes from within the unit. How do individ-uals in the unit view contingency  training, as a chore or a challenge?  If seen as distracting from theday-to-day peacetime duties, training is probably considered a chore. If individuals focus on how to over-come the shortages of equipment, time, and money, training is hopefully a challenge. Good training is anattitude: it takes work to overcome the obstacles. Help the commander by outlining a good training pro-gram, getting everyone involved, setting training objectives, and developing an annual training schedule. 114AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Chapter 6  EXERCISES, EVALUATIONS, AND INSPECTIONS 6.1.  Introduction. Exercise, evaluations and inspections—though not popular —are an important part ofreadiness and contingency response preparations. Exercises provide civil engineers with valuable oppor-tunities to practice base-wide contingency responses and to train our personnel. Exercises enhance readi-ness, improve crisis response, boost combat capability, streamline procedures, and help units masterOPLAN taskings. Evaluations and inspections provide  important feedback to units and commanders onthe adequacy of contingency planning, preparations,  and training. The challenge  is to intelligently useexercises, evaluations and inspections to enhance CE capabilities. 6.2.  Overview. This chapter outlines civil engineer involvement in exercises. It highlights the local exer-cises engineers participate in and offers suggestions on planning unit activities. This chapter briefly dis-cusses the joint service and MAJCOM exercises that CE teams may support. The chapter closes with adiscussion on local exercise evalua tions and offers tips for inspection preparation. While this chapterfocuses on base CE organizations and Prime BEEF units, RED HORSE units are major exercise players. 6.3.  Civil Engineer Involvement. Civil engineers are routinely involved in exercises. Usually, local exer-cises, but some engineers also have opportunities to participate in MAJCOM and joint service exercises.The degree of involvement depends upon exercise objecti ves and scenarios. In local exercises, units canusually dictate its level of ef fort by choosing to be a major player in  exercise planning. The more CE isinvolved, the better the unit will be  prepared to respond to crises. Unit attitude is important. A CE unitgains the greatest benefit when its personnel enthusiastically participate in all aspects of an exercise, fromplanning to final critique. It is no coincidence that in the best units the CE commander is actively involvedin the exercises, evaluations, and inspections. Where engineers look upon these activities as hindrances totheir “real job,” there is  usually a problem. These activities also  are not taken seriously when personnelare under-involved and have a lot of “sit-around” time—they get bored. The unit can improve attitudes byhelping create realistic local exercises that involve all members. Since only limited number of civil engi-neers have the opportunity to partic ipate in joint service or MAJCOM  exercises, unit leaders must pushfor engaged local exercises with maximum civil engineer involvement. 6.4.  Local Exercises. Local exercises provide opportunities for trai ning and evaluation. They are con-ducted more frequently than majo r off-base exercises, and the unit has more control over them. A FI10-2501 directs the type, category, and frequency of exercises to be  conducted. Functional publicationsprovide additional exercise requirements. Some exercise requirements that involve civil engineers are: 6.4.1.  Major Accident Response  Exercise (MARE). Each of follo wing MARE scenarios are to beconducted annually: a conventional munitions accident, a nuclear weapon accident if applicable to thebase, off-base response, mass casualty accident, HAZMAT response, radioactive material, and airshow response before an air show at the base. AFI 10-2501 and MAJCOM Supplements outline otherrequirements. If the base has a HAZMAT team, it should be exercised at le ast annually IAW withguidelines in AFMAN 32-4013. 6.4.2.  Natural Disaster Response Exercise (or review). If the MAJCOM has identified the installationas being subject to catastrophic natural disasters, conduct annual exercises of the type specified. Otherinstallations may conduct reviews. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 20081156.4.3.  Terrorist Use of CBRNE.  Conduct two CBRNE exercises annua lly, one must be a biologicalincident. 6.4.4.  Operational Readiness Exerci se (ORE). If in a low threat  area, conduct an annual CBRNEexercise that reflects the most stringent CBRNE threat s in place, or that ex peditionary forces couldface. In medium threat areas, conduct semi-annual CBRNE exercises, one of which may be a table topexercise. In high threat areas, conduct CBRNE exercises quarterly, one during the year may be a tabletop exercise. 6.5.  Planning the Exercise (CE portion). The Readiness and Emergency Management Flight and CE exer-cise evaluation team (EET) members work with th e local EET chief to plan  civil engineer exerciseinvolvement. Push for realistic sc enarios with minimum simulation. Th e more realistic an exercise, thegreater its value as an evaluation and training tool. Be sure to receive the commander’s input as to what heor she wants tested. Be ready to offer suggestions on what capabilities most need improvement and whatareas could benefit most from being exercised. 6.5.1.  Set Objectives. When planning CE inputs, first determine or set objectives for the exercise. Theparticular crisis or threat will dictate the basic thrust of the exercise. Also consider MAJCOM specialinterest items, Inspector General (IG) findings from other units, and deficiencies noted from previousexercises when setting exercise objectives. Do not overlook the common-core criteria detailed in AFI90-201, Inspector General Activities. General information is also contained in AFI 10-204, ReadinessExercises and After-Action Reporting Program. Obviously, the scenarios should test response capa-bilities and evaluate response planning. Scenarios should also identify limiting factors (LIMFAC) andevaluation of the following: 6.5.1.1.  Recall procedures. 6.5.1.2.  Command and control. 6.5.1.3.  Crisis management; the ability to respond to the situation (recovery actions). 6.5.1.4.  Predisaster actions. 6.5.1.5.  Security (OPSEC and COMSEC). 6.5.1.6.  Deployment processing. 6.5.1.7.  Postdisaster recovery. 6.5.2.  Requirements Vary. Exercise requirements vary with unit location and mission. 6.5.2.1.  CONUS Bases. CONUS forces must be capable of responding to peacetime disasters andemergencies. During wartime, they must also be capable of maintaining essential base functions.For wartime simulations, exercise planners should assume that  Prime BEEF teams are deployedand that remaining forces and resources must sustain essential base functions. CONUS unitsshould exercise the civil engineer contingency response capability at least once  each year usingonly the non-mobile force. One possibility is to  conduct a recovery exer cise while the PrimeBEEF mobile teams receive their annual bivouac training. The ne ed to pay civilian overtime andto consider work conditions negotiated with a civil service union may limit options to have civil-ian employees participate in these exercises. 6.5.2.2.  Overseas Bases. In-place forces should also exercise and receive evaluation in peacetimedisaster responses as well as the traditional wartime tasks: EM operations; ADR; EOD; utility and116AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008facility operations and maintenance; emergency repair of utilities and facilities; FES; debrisremoval; base denial; and other personnel support. Some exercises should be held without the ben-efit of locally hired civilian employees. Become familiar with Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)and other rules governing local civilian labor participation in exercises. 6.5.2.3.  Prime BEEF Teams. During wartime, civil engineers must be able  to provide base andfacility support to satisfy mission requirements worldwide. These operations may be conducted ina wide range of locations incl uding main, collocated, limited,  standby, and bare bases. PrimeBEEF personnel will normally form  a base civil engineer unit or  augment an existing civil engi-neer unit. Civil engineer support requirements for specific theater bases are normally documentedin In-Garrison Expeditionary Support or Joint Support Plans.  When available, use such informa-tion to enhance the exercises and evaluate the readiness capability of Prime BEEF mobility forces.Evaluate Prime BEEF forces  on mobility and deployment pla nning and execution, employment,and redeployment. 6.5.3.  Some Hints. Consider the following thoughts wh en planning civil engineer exercise involve-ment: 6.5.3.1.  Avoid the stereotyped or “canned” exercise—no two exer cises should be the same andvary the location. When exercising recovery res ponse, incorporate different problems and differ-ent types of buildings and utility systems. 6.5.3.2.  Be thorough when planning and designing s cenarios. Include as many shops as reason-able in the exercise. 6.5.3.3.  Build exercises as close to real-world scen arios as possible. Add details that help createthe stress and pressure experienced in actual situations. For example, provide a plethora of dam-age input to the EOC and CE control center from many sources over a short period of time. Han-dling a lot of both useful and extraneous information stresses control center personnel, but it alsogives them needed practice in sorting out what situations deserve priority attention. 6.5.3.4.  Exercise when it is not convenient and under unique conditions. It may be a routine taskto conduct a recovery exercise under norma l circumstances; try it  during non-duty hours withphones out of commission or under radio-silence. 6.5.3.5.  If civilian employees are to participate in exercises during non-duty hours, prepare to payovertime. 6.5.3.6.  Be creative—setting up quality exercises can be exciting and create interest for unit per-sonnel. 6.5.4.  Implementing Realism. An example of one base implementing realism in an exercise went likethis—they operated for five days without commercial power, using only back up or standby genera-tors. To add even more realism, the exercise was conducted while Prime BEEF teams were deployed.Such an exercise has tremendous impact on the entire  base. This is not an easy concept to sell to aninstallation commander. Such an exercise does not have to last mu ch more than a day to gain majorbenefits, but it is best done as part of a larger base exercise with all units participating. All personnellearn their true dependence on CE-provided power. They get a realistic opport unity to identify theirwartime limitations and develop work -arounds—the same applies to ci vil engineers. This type ofexercise conveys realism and encourages enthusiastic participation by all civil engineers. The CE unitrisks an immediate demand for emer gency generators from every unit on base—that cannot reason-AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008117ably be satisfied. Due to  potential impact of such an exercise, the installation commander shouldinform the MAJCOM in advance. 6.6.  Higher Headquarters Exercises. Civil engineers o ccasionally have the opportunity to participate inlarger scale MAJCOM and joint serv ice exercises. These exercises of fer a great chance to hone contin-gency skills, both during the exercise and on exercise related construction. For these exercises, PrimeBEEF and RED HORSE teams will not likely be involved in the exercise planning. That planning will beaccomplished by the joint or  MAJCOM engineers. CE  teams often arrive first  to beddown the exerciseparticipants and leave last after camp teardown. Exercises offer an opportunity to test mobile forces’ abil-ity to meet time sensitive requirements. While these  exercises usually last a week or more, they exposecivil engineers to tasks and equipment not used very often. BEAR equipment is frequently used and expe-dient methods often required. This  provides the important benefit  of offering Prime BEEF and REDHORSE personnel the unique opportun ity for additional “hands-on” tr aining with this equipment undersimulated wartime conditions. The following paragraphs provide examples of major exercises civil engi-neers support. 6.6.1.  Exercise FOAL EAGLE, and Reception, S taging, Onward Movement & Integration Exercise(RSO&I). These exercises test the ability of the US military to reinforce its forces in the Republic ofKorea in combined operations wi th South Korean forces. Prim e BEEF and RED HORSE personnelare deployed to augment in-place civil engineer units to provide force beddown, operations and main-tenance support, and base recovery capabilities. 6.6.2.  Exercise BRIGHT STAR. This joint service exercise is conducted in Southwest Asia to evalu-ate USCENTCOM capabilities. Some CE personnel are deployed to provide force beddown and baseoperations and maintenance. 6.6.3.  Exercise BRIM FROST. This joint service exercise is conducted in Alaska. The vast majorityof Air Force civil engineer support comes from personnel assigned to units in Alaska. However, sup-port from CE units in the “lower 48” is encouraged. This exercise presents an excellent opportunity topractice contingency skills in an extreme cold weather environment. 6.6.4.  Exercise FUERTE CAMINOS (STRONG ROAD). This exercise has a humanitarian and civicaction focus versus the ope rational employment focus of the other exercises. It occurs in CentralAmerica several times during the year, and provides engineers w ith an excellent opportunity to useand learn expedient construction methods. 6.6.5.  MAJCOM Exercises. Many exercises are planned and conducted each year by individual MAJ-COMs such as ACC, PACAF, USAFE, and AMC. Seldom are units from ot her than the sponsoringMAJCOM involved. 6.7.  Benefits of Hosting Major Exercises. Hosting a major exercise can be taxing, but can be beneficial.For example, exercise funds may be used to construct exercise facilities that the unit can use later for localexercises. The construction provides valuable prac tice for CE teams. The MA JCOM or the joint com-mand provides the exercise construction requirements, but the unit can certain ly identify needs andattempt to develop mutually satisfying solutions. 6.8.  Evaluations. An earlier paragraph mentioned the n eed to set exercise objectives. Each base has  anexercise evaluation team to determine if exercise objectives are met. The installation commander appointsthe EET chief. Each unit commander designates individuals to serve on the team to evaluate its own func-118AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008tional area. The evaluators need to  be experts in their field and we ll-trained. Exercises should not be an“us against them” event for the EET members and they must avoid the temptation to nit-pick. The evalu-ator’s role is to help the unit expose big problems and identify the reason for the problem. EET membersshould also be alert to give credit where credit is due. 6.8.1.  In conjunction wi th the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight, the CE evaluatorsshould develop checklists to aid in their evalua tions; a good place to start  is AFI 90-201. It providescommon-core evaluation criteria for Prime BEEF, mobility, environmental, OPSEC, SORTS, andself-defense of deployed units (self-defense applies to RED HORSE). The common-core criteria out-line baseline tasks to be measured, desired combat readiness status, and rating criteria to use by Oper-ational Readiness Inspection (ORI) teams. The common-core criteria emphasize performance versuscompliance. They are valuable tools when evalua ting civil engineer planning and execution duringcontingency and disaster response exercises. Do not forget the guidance contained in MAJCOM sup-plements to AFI 90-201. As with exercises , checklists should not be static —the first checklists willnot be perfect. As EET members learn, encourage them to update checklists. 6.8.2.  Evaluations are worthless if identified problem s are not corrected. In after -exercise critiques,designate who is to fix what problems. Establish a target date they can live with, and ensure everyoneunderstands they are to fix the problems. Then follow up personally or appoint a trusted individual tomake sure corrections are completed. Eliminate recurring deficiencies—the unit does not wantrepeats, especially during inspections and assessments. 6.9.  Inspections and Assessments. While official MAJCOM inspections and assessments cause great anx-iety and are not enjoyable, use them to improve readiness and contingency response programs. Anticipatewhat the inspectors will look for by  looking at previous unit inspection reports and recent reports fromother units. Ensure the unit can perform the common-core tasks. Call counterparts at units just inspectedand get their personal perspective. During inspection preparation, the unit improves unit response capabil-ities. 6.10.  Summary. Training and exercising as a unit produces unit cohesion and combat capability. Trainingalongside other functional and operational specialties develops integrated combat support. Exercises areimportant tools to measure the effectiveness of civil engineer contingency planning and preparations.Joint service exercises expose Prime BEEF teams to  major contingency tasks under actual deployed(field) conditions. Unfortunately, few teams have the opportunity to participate. A MAJCOM operationalreadiness inspection measures a unit’s capability to accomplish its wartime tasks, but these inspections arenot frequent enough to give commanders a steady flow  of readiness information. Local exercises remainthe best way to give commanders adequate force readiness information and provide personnel with realis-tic training. Use creativity, imagination, and realism when planning and conducting any exercise. Fol-low-up to fix problems and deficiencies identified during exercises, evaluations, and inspections. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008119Chapter 7  INFORMATION COLLECTION, RECORDS, AND FORMS 7.1.

Plans are prepared by combatant commanders in response to requirements established by theChairman of the Joint Ch iefs of Staff and by commanders of subordinate commands in response torequirements tasked by the establishing unified commander. Operation plans either are prepared in acomplete format (OPLAN) or as a concept plan (CONPLAN). The CONPLAN can be published with orwithout a time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) file. a. OPLAN - An operation plan for th e conduct of joint operations that  can be used as a basis fordevelopment  of an operation order (OPORD). An   OPLAN identifies the forces and supp liesrequired to execute the combatant co mmander’s strategic concept and  a movement schedule ofthese resources to the theater of operations. The forces and supplies are identified in TPFDD files.OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked operation. The plan is prepared with the appropriateannexes, appendixes, and TPFDD files as descri bed in the Joint Operation Planning and Execu-tion System manuals containing planning policies, procedures, and formats. b. CONPLAN  - An operational plan in an abbreviated  format that would require considerableexpansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the com-batant commander’s strategic concept and those annexes and appendixes deemed necessary by thecombatant  commander to complete planning. Ge nerally,  detailed suppor t  requirements are notcalculated and TPFDD files are not prepared. c. CONPLAN with TPFDD - A CONPLAN with TPFDD is the same as a CONPLAN except that itrequires more detailed planning for phased deployment of forces.

Readiness—The ability of US military forces to fight  and meet the demands  of the national militarystrategy. Readiness is the synthesis of two distinct but interrelated levels: a. Unit readiness – the ability to provide capabilities required by the combatant commanders to exe-cute their assigned missions. This is derived from the ability of each unit to deliver the outputs forwhich it was designed. b. Joint readiness – the combatant commander’s ability to integrate and synchronize ready combatand support forces to execute his or her assigned missions. (JP 1-02).

General Guidance. The basic sources of information for OPLAN preparation are AFI 10-401,AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, and Headquarters Air Force Functional Area Managers. These sources per-mit considerable latitude in format for plans other than MAJCOM OPLANs and concept plans (CON-PLAN), which are written in support of joint serv ice plans. The CE Conti ngency Response Plan (CRP)follows the basic format but varies to satisfy specific CE needs and to better support the CEMP 10-2. Theformat also makes it easy to add annexes or appendi xes to support other plan  taskings. The contingencyresponse plan does not replace CE input to other plans. Rather, it provides a convenient place to expandupon those inputs and provide detailed CE-specific response instructions. Table 2.5. lists plans CE oftensupports. Figure 2.1. shows where details to support those plans can be incorporated into the contingencyresponse plan. Some of those details are included in the examples in this attachment. A2.1.1.  The CRP contains a great deal of information in one convenient place to help civil engineersmake quick and sound decisions in  contingency situations. The large volume of information dictatesthat it be well or ganized to find needed information quickly. The ideal arrangement puts the mostimportant information at the fingertips. The suggested format in this attachment will organize the planin modules and then placed in binders, so all le vels of the organization can easily grab the bookrequired for each particular situation. The book de signed for each shop, team, or control center posi-tion need not have a complete CRP, but it should contain execution checklists (derived from the plan’soperating instructions); a copy of the applicable operating instructions; required maps and schematics;communication procedures, etc. A2.1.2.  Except for the annex letters and titles that  are specified in AFI 10- 211, the formats in thisattachment are guides only. If a more useful format for the base exists, use it and share it with others.Send ideas to HQ AFCESA and indicate that they are for consideration in the next update to this pam-phlet. A2.1.3.  The contingency re sponse plan should help the CE unit re spond to crises. Consequently, itmust contain response procedures  and useful supporting information.  It is very easy to include somuch information that the plan  becomes arduous. Avoid this by starting with a clear idea of what toinclude and what level of detail. Always review the plan in progress to ensure it stays within the gameplan. A plan does not need to cover every conceivable situation. It is a good plan if it clearly outlinesthe following for major situations. A2.1.3.1.  Who is to respond? A2.1.3.2.  What resources they are to take. A2.1.3.3.  Where to obtain resources, including any special access requirements. A2.1.3.4.  Where they are to go first. A2.1.3.5.  What initial tasks they are to do A2.1.3.6.  Who is in charge? A2.1.3.7.  How they are to communicate with their boss. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008135A2.1.3.8.  And how they will resupply. A2.1.4.  When a contin gency response plan is we ll researched and prepared, it will require fewchanges over the years, only tweak s to change names and equipmen t status. If the plan has manyweaknesses, not all have to be co rrected at one time. Pick one anne x or appendix at a time and do athorough job with it. Once completed with one of the first three  annexes (A, B, or C), the remainingwill be significantly easier. A2.1.5.  There are many ways to format a plan. Be  consistent as possible, practical, and logical.Attempt to place the same type information in the same relative place and use similar titles throughoutthe different appendixes or tabs. For example, choos e to place communication pr ocedures last in allappendixes or tabs. Such consistency makes the plan user friendly. A2.2.  Plan Components. The components to an OPLAN submitted by a MAJCOM or NAF are normallyconsists of a cover; a letter of transmittal; security instructions and record of changes; plan and planninginformation releasability; a plan s ummary; a table of contents; the basic plan ; attachments; executionchecklists; and a distribution list. Include these components in  the contingency response plan, but onlythree are necessary: the table of contents, the basic plan, and the attachments (with their annexes, appen-dixes, and tabs). These components are discussed in the following paragraphs. If the plan contains classi-fied information, mark the plan according to the AFI 10-401, Volume 2, and add the security instructionscomponent. Refer to AFI 10-401, Volume 2, for guidance on the other co mponents. A cover is optionalfor the CRP, but adds a finishing touch to a plan (Figure A2.1.). A2.3.  Table of Contents. Figure A2.2. presents a sample format for a table of contents. Suggest the devel-opment of a draft or working table of contents early in  the plan preparation process. It serves as a usefulplan preparation guide and makes it easier for others to assist in plan development. A2.4.  Basic Plan. Format and guidance for the basic plan is included in Figure A2.3. This sample is writ-ten as an unclassified plan. It is  recommended that the pl an be written as an unclassified document. Ifclassified material is required, incorporate that material into a  classified annex that is printed and boundseparately from the basic document. A2.5.  Attachments (e.g., Annexes, Appendixes, and Tabs). There is no required format or content forannexes, appendixes, or tabs. The following paragraphs offer some format and content suggestions. Fig-ure A2.2. also highlights one way to organize the appendixes and tabs. The list of appendixes and tabs inthe figure is not intended to be comprehensive, tail or it as needed. Add, drop,  or consolidate appendixesto cover the situations at the base. Create tabs (operating instructions) to guide the response of each teamorganized for each situation.  Table 2.1. through Table 2.4. in Chapter 2 may trigger ideas for otherappendixes and tabs; use as  few or as many appendixes  and tabs as required. If  an annex is not needed,still list it in the table of contents with its corresponding letter, but mark it “Not Used.” Use locally definedannexes U, V, and W if needed to include information  that does not fit well into the other annexes. Theletters “I” and “O” are generally not used as labels for annexes or tabs to avoid confusion with the num-bers one and zero. A2.6.  Annex A—Major Peacetime Accident. The recommended format for this annex is the same as thebasic plan, but this annex sh ould provide more detail on  major accident responses (Figure A2.4.). Theemphasis in the basic annex should be on the conditions which trigger a response, the major CE taskings,136AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008and the command relationships. The appendixes and ta bs provide the specific  details for CE responseteams. Likely accidents are covered in separate appendixes. The tabs to each appendix contain operatinginstructions for control centers and for each flight, shop, or team that must respond, either initially or in asupport role. General information for the basic annex can be extracted from annex A of the CEMP 10-2,especially from the CE appendixes. Rather than duplicate that information in two plans, write it in one andcross-reference it in the other. If information is extracted from the CEMP 10-2 (or any other plan) and itis rewritten often, the contingency response plan may have to be updated just as often. A2.6.1.  Appendixes to Annex A.  Prepare an appendix for each majo r accident likely to occur on ornear the installation. Accidents that ca ll for the same initial response across the or ganization can beconsolidated into one appendix. While accident situat ions vary, the initial response will generally besimilar. At least three appendixe s will be needed: one for on-ba se accidents, one for of f-baseresponses, and one for  hazardous material (HAZMAT) spills. Accidents involving nuclear materialsmay trigger the need for another appendix; follow the CEMP 10-2 direction. See Figure A2.5. for thesuggested format. A2.6.2.  Tabs to Appendixes in Annex A. Create tabs to provide specific instructions for the responseof each flight, shop, team, and control center. Recommend that tabs be formatted as operating instruc-tions as in Figure A2.6. CE control centers, flights, shops, and teams should develop execution check-lists from their operating instructions (tabs). Checklists are not part of the plan. A2.6.3.  Common Appendixes and Tabs. When guidance applies to all teams, a common appendix ortab can be written. A common tab is useful when there is a large amount of identical information andwhen not wanting to duplicate it in all tabs. Unit recall and assembly procedures and communicationprocedures are two examples. Special notifica tion and communication requirements should still beincluded in individual appendixes and tabs. If common appendixes and tabs are chosen, recommendusing that format throughout the plan. A2.7.  Annex B—Natural Disaster. Tailor the basic formats to present the information required in thisannex and its appendixes and tabs. Write an appendix for each “likely” natural disaster such as hurricane,tornado, wild fire, flood, etc. Where responses differ from those of an accident, write different operatinginstructions for each appendix. When responses are essentially the same, refer to a previous tab. Be sureto cover CE predisaster, dispersal, and evacuation actions. Also, address CE actions to provide temporaryshelter for disaster victims. See Figure A2.2. for ideas about appendixes in this annex. A2.8.  Annex C—Enemy Attack. The instructions for annex B also apply to this annex, except the appen-dixes will reflect wartime activities. Figure A2.2. offers ideas on other appendixes and tabs for this annex.Content suggestions for some of the appendixes follow. A2.8.1.  Appendix 1—Notification, Recall, and Assembly. Outline procedures used to notify the unitof its need to resp ond. Describe instructions and assign responsibility to initiate unit recall. Coverindividual responsibilities when notified to return to duty: recall responsibilities, what personal gear tobring, when and where to report, etc. Include notif ication, recall, and assembly instructions for eachtype of response. When the instructions apply to more than one situation, cross-reference rather thanrepeat the same instructions. A2.8.2.  Appendix 2—Base Reception Plan Support. Present the CE tasks and detailed instructions tobeddown forces that augment the base, or temporarily accommodate forces flowing through duringAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008137war. Also, cover all CE support to temporarily shelter non-combatant evacuees. Outline tasks by pri-ority order and indicate who will do each. Include a schedule showing when tasks must be completed. A2.8.3.  Appendix 3—Expedient Hardening. Provide instructions for the expedient hardening tasksthat CE must perform and for required support to other units engaged in hardening their own facilitiesand equipment. List the facilities involved, indicate what is to be done, by whom, and when. A2.8.4.  Appendix 4—Resource Dispersal. Identify resources to be disp ersed, how they will bemoved, who will do it, where they will go, and when. Also, identify any site preparation required forthe locations where teams disperse  as well as equipment and materi als they should take to preparethose sites. Include classified information in annex X. A2.8.5.  Appendix 5—Non-Combatant  Evacuation. If not included in  the Base Reception Plan Sup-port appendix, be sure to include CE support in some appendix. Since this is a base wide effort, showCE interface and timing. A2.8.6.  Appendix 6—Casualty Care. Following base procedures, explain what the unit and individualmembers are to do with casualties—both the wounded and the dead. Some details may not be able tobe included, such as locations of casualty collection points, because that information may not be avail-able until just before hostilities be gin or after an attack. The fact  that casualties should be taken tothose locations can be noted in this appendix as well as requirements to notify team chiefs or supervi-sors. A2.8.7.  Appendix 7—Base Recovery After Attack Ac tions. While the type,  intensity, extent, andduration of an attack cannot be known, this appendix and its tabs can provide the details for the initialCE response to a base attack. Th e details between an overseas and  a CONUS base will naturally beconsiderably different. The example in Figure A2.2. outlines the situation at an overseas base. A2.8.8.  Appendix 8—Vehicle and Limited Area Contamination Control. Show how vehicles and lim-ited areas (mission essential equipment, and command post entry points) can be decontaminated dur-ing peacetime chemical accide nts or wartime CBRNE  operations. Include a list of vehicles,equipment, and personnel used in decontamination operations. A2.8.9.  Appendix 9—Survival, Reconstitution, and Recovery. If the base has a SRR tasking, includeCE support actions in an appendix. As with all responses, identify what is to be done, by whom, withwhat resources, by when, and where. A2.8.10.  Appendix 10—Security and Bas e Defense. Show how CE personn el designated to beararms are to be used during cont ingencies and wartime operations. This requires direction from secu-rity forces. If they do not plan to use CE personnel, state that. Plans must contain provisions for com-mand and control with emphasis on fire control. Include an indication of when CE personnel might becalled on to help, such as a specific DEFCON or  FPCON or a specific situation. Usually this will beincluded only at overseas bases. A2.8.11.  Appendix 11—Weapons and Ammunition Management. Civil engineer forces assigned orsubject to performing recovery operations in a hostile environment should be armed, weapons-trained,and qualified to bear arms. In ge neral, the management of weapon s assigned to any civil engineerorganization is a shared responsibility between the commander, the readiness flight chief, a deployingPrime BEEF team chief, and the  individuals receiving the weapons. This appendix must address themanagement of the weapons authorized for use by Air Force engineers. Rather than a separate appen-138AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008dix, this information can be included as a tab (opera ting instruction) in the security and base defenseappendix. Instructions relating to deployment preparations can be included in Annex F. A2.8.11.1.  Address the accountability and mainte nance of all weapons assigned to the or ganiza-tion. The intent is to ensure that weapons and ammunition are controlled and that security proce-dures are followed when weapons are in storage or when they are issued to individuals. Stipulatethe security procedures to follow when weap ons are issued to ensure positive control is main-tained at all times. A2.8.11.2.  Address storage of weapons and ammunition in garrisons and under field conditions.The instructions should spell out procedures used to protect the firearms as well as the method ofsounding an alarm if a forceful  theft is attempted. An armed re sponse force must be reas onablyavailable to protect the weapons. A2.8.11.3.  Also, address the movement of weapons. This includes the preparation, storage, mar-shalling, issue, courier, and safeguarding of small arms and a mmunition deployed in support ofcontingency operations. A2.8.12.  Appendix 12—Base Denial. CONUS bases do not requi re this annex. Engineers are wellqualified to execute denial operations with hea vy equipment and demolitions, but other units mustalso be involved in denying their fa cilities and equipment. This annex must provide detailed instruc-tions for carrying out CE denial  tasks. When selecting facilities and equipment for denial, plannersmust consider national policy restrictions, if any, of the US or hos t nation. Coordinate, as required,with other functional areas, US elements, joint commands, and allied forces. Generally, these consid-erations should be covered in the installation deni al plan. Theater commanders establish the policiesgoverning denial operations in the theater, and delegate base-specific denial planning and execution tothe lower level command. As a minimum: A2.8.12.1.  State conditions for base denial when possible. A2.8.12.2.  List the commanders having local denial authority. A2.8.12.3.  List specific facilities, utilities, equipment, and supplies to deny. Indicate the methodand degree of denial. Assign those “targets” to specific denial crews for execution. Identify discre-tionary targets and the conditions in which they would be denied. Also, identify any prohibited tar-gets, such as facilities which must  not be damaged, because they  have historical or culturalsignificance. Evacuation of equipment and materials is as much  a part of denial operations asdestruction and should always be considered first. A2.8.12.4.  List the priority for destruction or  evacuation. Delineate the time phasing of denial.The amount of time available can affect the order in which items are denied. With little time, thehigher priority facilities will likely be denied first. With additional time and an uncertain situation,the higher priority facilities may be saved until the last. A2.8.12.5.  For evacuation, specify what items will be moved, on what vehicles, and by whom. A2.8.12.6.  Describe availability  of special civil engineer denial teams (such as RED HORSEdemolition teams). A2.8.12.7.  Outline limitations on destructive denial. A2.8.12.8.  Describe safety and security measures to be followed. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008139A2.8.12.9.  Describe how denial resources, from bot h on-base and off-base sources, will be allo-cated. A2.8.12.10.  Include instructions for removal or destruction of classified materials and documents. A2.8.13.  Appendix 13—Minimum  Alert Preparations. There will al ways be a need to outline themost important actions to get ready for war with minimum notice. Consider including minimum alertpreparations in each individual annex, appendix, and tab. Consolidate them in one appendix or includethem in annex X, if classified. Because of the time sensitivity, be sure to list the tasks in priority order;identify who will do them; state what resources will be available, priorities for use of equipment; andspecify when they should be completed. A2.8.14.  Appendix 14—Facility Operations and Maintenance with Limited Manpower. Identify whatfacility operations and maintenance tasks will be performed when not all members of the CE unit areavailable. This includes operation of utility and HVAC systems. Two scenarios come to mind: PrimeBEEF teams have deployed or the civilian workforce is unavailable for any reason at bases in foreigncountries. Cover each scenario as appropriate for the base. A2.8.15.  Appendix 15—Operations Secu rity (OPSEC). Civil engineers  must always be sensitive tooperations security. Describe procedures to minimize transmission by non-secure radios, phones,computers, messages, etc., of information about base status and uni t capabilities. The status of mosttasks covered in this annex is OPSEC sensitive. A2.8.16.  Appendix 16—Communication Procedures. If not covered elsewhere, include a communi-cations appendix. Be sure to cover the allocation of equipment, communication procedures and prior-ities, call signs, authentication codes, etc. Classified information should be included in annex X. A2.9.  Annex D—Terrorist Attack. Response to terrorist use of CBRNE requires many of the sameresponse actions as other types of incidents; however, responders must also establish and maintain a chainof custody for evidence preservation as directed by the IC. Responders must be alert for physical indica-tors and other outward warning signs of additional  CBRNE events, including armed assault. Also, theymust consider the potential for secondary attack, such as chemical dispersal devices, secondary explosivedevices or booby traps.. A2.10.  CE Support for Miscellaneous Plan s/Situations. This annex permits the plan to include CE sup-port for situations that are peculiar to a base or do not logically fit into annexes A, B, or C. It is suggestedto prepare an appendix with tabs for each of thos e plans or situations. G ood examples include a bombthreat, the Stop Alert Plan, mortuary support, and the Installation Secu rity Plan (or Resource ProtectionPlan). Joint Support Plans require ce rtain actions to be taken by ove rseas USAF support bases when theplans are implemented. If the unit has such taskings, include them in this annex. Provisions to protect realproperty records and engineering record drawings from damage can be included here or in annexes B andC to tie them to a specific crisis. A2.11.  Annex E—Fire Emergency Services Operations. Describe ARFF structural firefighting, contain-ment, other emergency services, and response actions to be taken during attack , natural disaster, majoraccidents, major fire incidents (as prescribed by AFIs 32-2001, 10-2501 and 10-210), and local operationsplans. Emphasis should be on the to tal unit response and  support for firefighting operations. “Normal”emergency responses and firefighting operations need  not be included if they  are covered by pre-fireplans. Include the following elements: 140AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008A2.11.1.  FES vehicles and quantities of fire suppression agents available on base. A2.11.2.  Emergency off-base responses, including predesignated firefighting vehicles with theirun-refueled on-road travel distances. Include logistics support requirements. A2.11.3.  Procedures to provide  fire emergency services for nearby federal facilities if municipalemployee strikes or slowdowns inhibit normal municipal fire suppression services. A2.11.4.  Conflagration hazards and natural cover fires. A2.11.5.  Alternate water sources. A2.11.6.  Vehicle resupply procedures (agent, water, and fuel), procurement of additional firefightingagent supplies, and the availability of personnel from other than the FES organization. A2.11.7.  Specific responsibilities of other organizations to support FES operations, types of equip-ment available by support agencies, and response procedures. This includes auxiliary firefighting. A2.11.8.  Reciprocal/mutual aid agreements for fire protection en tered into by Air Force installationFES with other fire or ganizations. These agreements ensure adequate manpower and equipment areavailable to cope with major fire incidents and disaster situations that exceed the capability of the AirForce installation FES. The agreements should be  summarized or the actua l agreements included inannex M. A2.11.9.  Confined space rescue. Include procedures and support requirements for confined space res-cue. Cover situations where the FES flight traditionally acts independently (such as rescues from  aPOL tank, an on-aircraft fuel cell, or a burning building) and situations that require an integrated effortby the disaster response force (such as a collapsed building rescue). A2.12.  Annex F—Deployment Preparations. As needed, include appendixes and tabs to define all actionsrequired to prepare the Prime BEEF  teams for deployment once they ar e alerted. Provide details for CEtasks outlined in the base  deployment plan. Assign responsibi lities to specific crews and identify wheneach task must be completed. Suggest the preparation of operating instructions for mobilizing the teams;preparing, marshalling, and transporting equipment and weapons; and if required, convoying the team toits port of embarkation. This annex should not duplicate information in the base deployment plan. A2.13.  Annex G—Contingency Environmental Considerations. Include instructions for environmentalprotection that are unique to contingencies or are so important that they need to be emphasized. By wayof example, contractors dispose of toxic wastes for most bases. In war, contract disposal may not be pos-sible. Identify procedures to temp orarily store or permanently dispos e of toxic materials when the unitcannot get access to an approved disposal location. If materials are to be buried,  identify those sites inadvance and determine what methods  and materials that will be used  to control runoff and leaching intothe ground. Non-standard pollution prevention and clean-up procedures should be addressed. Addressprocedures to protect on-base water supplies from HAZMAT spills and indirect runoff. A2.14.  Annex H—Facility Priority Listing. List the priority of installation facilities in their importance tothe installation mission. The list indicates which facilities get priority attention for actions such as expedi-ent hardening, firefighting, damage recovery, or utilities isolation (in reverse order). The list should beused as a guide, not  a hard, fast plan, since unfore seen circumstances can easily dictate deviations. Inthose situations, common sense  and good judgment must prevail.  Figure A2.9. illustrates a sample for-mat. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008141A2.15.  Annex J—CE Personnel Shelters. Provide instructions for sheltering civil engineers before, dur-ing, and after disasters and war. List the personnel shelters that civil engineers will occupy or manage.Extract that information from the base  shelter listing or incorpor ate that list in its entirety. For each CEshelter, include capacity; the kind of shelter (CBRNE, tornado, flood, etc.); who owns and operates it andwho else uses it; how long it should be prepared for occupancy; what utilities it has (heat, power, backuppower, communications, etc.); protection factor and date of last survey if a nuclear shelter. Identify whichpart of the facility is to be used for shelter space if not the entire building. Include shelter preparation andoperating instructions for CE shelter management teams. Provide shelter assignment instructions for CEshops/teams. Follow MAJCOM guidance if more specific. A2.16.  Annex K—Personnel Augmentation. This annex covers where additional personnel—both skilledand unskilled—are to be obtained. This includes Prime BEEF team s, contractors, reserve backfills, baseaugmentees, etc. A2.16.1.  Appendix 1—Base Augmentees. List augmentee requirements from the base AugmentationDuty program and highlight their duties and responsib ilities and who in CE  is responsible for eachgroup. A2.16.2.  Appendix 2—Integration of Deployed Teams. Provide instructions for integrating PrimeBEEF and other teams that  are deployed to assist the  unit. Identify facilities, space, vehicles, equip-ment, and communications equipment that will be provided to those teams. Outline the command andcontrol arrangements and likely tasks the teams will complete. Suggest the inclusion of an outline forthe in-brief or written information the unit shoul d present to the arriving team and its commander/chief. Provide a situation brief, the information contained in th is appendix, administrative and logis-tics support procedures, natural hazards in the area, and special safety concerns. A2.16.3.  Appendix 3—Civilian Contractor Capability and Unskilled Labor in the Area. Include thefollowing information in this appendix: A2.16.3.1.  Available contractors by name, address, phone number, point of contact, and special-ties. A2.16.3.2.  Contact points for obtaining unskilled laborers. A2.16.3.3.  Any restraints that would preclude using local civilians. A2.16.4.  Appendix 4—CONUS Sustainment Backfill Requirements. At some CONUS bases, reservepersonnel backfill deployed Prime BEEF positions and provide essential facility operation and main-tenance during war. List those requirements and plan to ef ficiently receive and employ backfill per-sonnel. A2.16.5.  Appendix 5—Availability of Other Military Forces. List US military engineer forces (espe-cially reserve and guard un its) on or near the base that could  rapidly backfill essential positions.Include the name, phone number, and address of the point of contact. These units have their own war-time taskings, so they may only be available in peacetime. A2.17.  Annex L—Equipment and Supplies. This annex provides a su mmary of required and on-handcivil engineer equipment, vehicles, and supplies. It outlin es possible sources for those items if noton-hand. A2.17.1.  Appendix 1—Equipment under Direct Air Force Control. Include this information: 142AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008A2.17.1.1.  General purpose, construction, and debris cleanup vehicles and support equipmentrequired for contingency operations; list by type and  quantity available. If the equipment is notunder CE control, note its location along with the contact point for authorizing CE use. A2.17.1.2.  Equipment and vehicle disp ersal procedures if not alr eady included in Annex C. Forpeacetime dispersal at all bases and wartime disp ersal at CONUS bases,  include site location,vehicle restrictions, dispersal notification, support available at the  site, etc. Kits enabling contin-gency response crews to su rvive and operate at each dispersed site should be identified in thisappendix. Give copies of the OIs to each team leader involved, and place one copy in Annex L. A2.17.1.3.  Handwritten changes can be  made to the copies of the plans in the EOC, CE controlcenter/DCC, and the master plan in lieu of retyping and reprinting and distributing a new appen-dix. A2.17.1.4.  The suggested headings for this appendix is illustrated below: Requirement (type/number) Quantity Available Source Location Type Agreement Point of Contact A2.17.2.  Appendix 2—Equipment to be Acquired from Nearby Civilian or Military Sources, or OtherState and Federal Agencies. Sources, types of agreement, types of vehicles/equipment available, andpoints of contact (including name, address, and phone number) should be listed. If mutual aid agree-ments have been made, include a  copy of the document in annex M.  Use the format in paragraphA3.16.1. To speed the paper work, include completed sample AF Form 9s except for the quantity of anitem needed. Identify the fund citation to be used on the Form 9. A2.17.3.

A contingency plan is a set of procedures prepared in advance to respond to specificor various contingencies a base and unit may face. A good plan is tailored to the base’s and unit’s specificsituation (e.g., Ellsworth AFB, Sout h Dakota, does not need to plan  for hurricanes or tidal waves). Byanticipating problems and planning for them, the base and unit can  rapidly mobilize the technical, finan-cial, administrative and engineering resources needed to minimize detrimental impact to the base.Remember, to respond effectively to emergencies, contingencies and disasters, procedures and plans mustbe in place when the threat occu rs. Developing plans can be accomp lished in a wide variety of methodsand various levels of participation. This attachment outlines one proven method. Development is brokendown into five steps: research, preparation, coordination, publication, and review. This approach is appli-cable to either military or civilian planning and ca n be utilized to develop everything ranging from sup-port annexes to entire base support plans. A3.2.  STEP 1—Research. Plans are useful only if they are backed by good research. Determine what theunit (or base) may be required to  do and the place, conditions, and circ umstances that the unit (or base)may have to operate if the plan is  executed. Research involves at least five sub-steps: understanding theplanning task; learning the base mission; reviewing existing plans and guidance documents; analyzing thehazards and threats; and assessing unit (or base) response capability. A3.2.1.  Understand the Pl anning Task. This is the  first step in any planni ng process. The expectedtask and outcome must be established up front. Understand what the plan’s OPR wants from the unit.Be flexible, as more is learned during research, the task may need modifying. A3.2.2.  Understand the Base’s Mission. The basis for any planning is to know the mission of the base.Know the types of aircraft, their likely munitions and fuel loads, and priorities of aircraft to fulfill thewing's priority mission(s) (e.g., fighters, loading bombs, loading missiles, tankers, ISR assets, etc.). A3.2.3.  Review Existing Plans an d Directives. The unit will seldom  need to create a plan fromscratch. First, review the plan to modify. Then read the documents  the plan references and the docu-ments of the supporting intelligence.  Many Intel shops have the W orldwide Threat to Air Bases andstudies of the various weapon systems the enemy could bring against the base. Security Forces, FES,and supporting medical facility will have copies of their s upport agreements. The logistics plansoffice, contracting, and several other agencies may also have copies of support agreements with tenantunits and local authorities. This step is necessary to avoid “recreating the wheel.” A3.2.3.1.  Check the Supported Plans. Many  base-level plans are written to support someoneelse’s plans. Higher headquarters, another military service or agency, a local civilian agency, or themilitary and civil forces of another nation may have written the plan the unit is supporting. If pos-sible, always obtain and review a copy of the plan the unit is supporting. It will identify, with a fairdegree of clarity, what the authors expect the unit to do for them, who will control the implemen-tation of the plan, where the unit wi ll be expected to go, what the unit should bring, and so on.Plans written above the MAJCOM-level are normally too general to help write a base-level plan. A3.2.3.2.  Check Governing Directives. The AFIs , as supplemented by th e MAJCOM, will usu-ally contain good information about what the plan is supposed to address and how it is to be writ-ten. Specific support tasks or responsibilities may also be covered in the AFI, especially if the task160AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008is required by law. Support Agreements or contracts can provide  another source of informationabout the extent of operations the unit may be  required to perform, when, and under what condi-tions. A few examples of governing directives include AFI 10-211, AFI 10-403, AFI 10-2501,AFI 10-401 and AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2. A3.2.3.3.  Check for Rela ted Publications. Check the Air Force electr onic publishing site forrelated publications. If writing a h azardous material accident response plan, check the index forpublications that refer to environmental, hazardous material and accident response subjects. Aspecific example would be AFI 10-2501. A3.2.3.4.  Verify Currency of Information. Nothing can destroy the value of the plan and its cred-ibility as quickly as change. A3.2.3.4.1.  Check directives. Find out if the directives used to justify the requirements and totask other agencies have been superseded. A3.2.3.4.2.  Check the supported plans. As the down sizing of military forces continues, checkthe plans the unit is supporting. The unit may  need to revise plans  because units, or bases,being supported, or from whom th e unit expected support, may have departed. Also, as thethreat or wing’s missions change, the unit may not be required  to perform the same functionsat the same intensity as before. A3.2.3.4.3.  Ensure all referenced materials are valid. These could be checklists, other annexesof the plan, other plans, regulations, forms, operating instructions and a variety of other items.The specific reference may have changed location, been deleted, or no longer applies to the sit-uation described. A3.2.3.4.4.  Check background files for pending in formation. AFI(s) are subject to modifica-tion. Look for messages or memo randa that establish new pro cedures, policies, or require-ments. For example, USAFE may decide to revise its policy on the operation and maintenanceof the collective protection system s. The unit needs to know that  before it starts writing theOPLAN Annex that deals with  shelters. Similarly, if the MAJCOM or wing has just workedout a new support agreement with the local nuclear power station, the unit should incorporatethe changes into the plan. A3.2.3.4.5.  Make certain the addresses, or ganizational symbols, abbreviations, etc., are cor-rect. A3.2.4.  Hazard/Threat Analysis. A systematic hazard/threat analysis is an essential step in develop-ing emergency, disaster, contingency, or operations plans. The analys is identifies all possible threatsand vulnerabilities, presents historical information about past disasters, assesses future probability andfrequency of emergencies, and validates gathered information. Considerations include predictability,frequency, controllability, duration, scope, and intensity of hazards or threat s. There are three basicsteps in conducting a threat and hazards analysis, and they are: A3.2.4.1.  Hazard/Threat Identification. Gather information on the specific major accidents, natu-ral disasters, hazardous material spills, and enemy attacks the base could face. Know the kind andlevels of damage to expect from foes. For exam ple, how the attack will be conducted, what kindand size of weapons they will bring to bear against the base, what are their probable targets, howoften will they attack, etc? Learn the location of the hazards. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008161A3.2.4.2.  Vulnerability Analysis. Identify the parts of the base or off-base community that may beaffected by each hazard or threat; the population within each zone that is subject to harm; criticalfacilities or functions at risk (for example, hospital and command post); and property and environ-mental systems that may be damaged. A3.2.4.3.  Risk Analysis. A risk analysis provides  a means to judge the relative likelihood of ahazard/threat occurring and the  magnitude of harm to personnel  and mission should that hazard/threat occur. In other words, attempt to determine the most probable incidents and their worst pos-sible impact. The analysis includes judgments of the probability of occurrence and severity of con-sequences. Consider natural disasters and major ac cidents as part of the planning for both peaceand wartime. Nature is not patriotic and does not take vacations. During combat operations thechances of someone creating an accident go up because individuals are tired, equipment wears out,and individuals may not be paying as much attention to safety as they should. Know what kinds ofincidents are most likely to occur and how they might affect the wing’s mission in the worst man-ner. For example, ask if the base is subject to typhoons, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, heavy snowstorms, lightning storms, sand storms , earthquakes, forest fires, etc. Is the  base likely to sufferfrom sabotage or terrorist attacks? How will thes e incidents affect central power stations, POLdumps or supply lines, natural ga s or fuel lines, water lines or  towers, pumping stations, accessroads, etc.? Are there any points that multiple utility lines converge that could increase the dangeror damage if affected by the incident? What key command and control functions could beadversely affected and how could they be protected? A3.2.5.  Capability Assessment. Next, develop a realistic evaluation of the base’s ability to prevent orrespond to accidents, natural disasters, hazardous material spills, and enemy attack. Understand whatresources the wing can bring to bear on various peace and wartime contingencies, how well the wingis trained and prepared to respond, and where the  wing is weak. For example, how many fire trucks,and what kind, are available during peacetime? What are their capabilities? Is this quantity and capa-bility sufficient? Where are they lo cated? Is this location close enou gh to allow them to fulfill theirduties? Does this location provide adequate protection from accidents, disasters, or attacks? Will moretrucks be available in wartime? If yes, where would the unit get them? Can wartime fire trucks be usedto help respond to a peacetime incident if they were needed? Where are the additional trucks located?Are these vehicles protected? Ho w quickly can they be reached, equipped, manned, and made fullyoperational? These same kinds of questions may be applied to nearly any wing organization. A3.2.5.1.  Be sure th e capability assessment includes other military services, host nation, alliedmilitary forces, civil authorities, and government organizations that agree to help the base respondto and recover from a disaster, accident, or attack. Be familiar with the kind and levels of supportthat can be expected. For example, what kinds  of facilities are available for use, what kinds ofcommunications capabilities will they provide, how many vehicles, and what types, can they pro-vide for support, etc.? A3.2.5.2.  Know who controls which resources, where they plan to locate the resources, and howwell those resources are protected from the affects of weapons, disasters, or accidents. Since theseresources will be used to respond to various co ntingencies outlined in the plans, know whom tocontact in order to coordinate  or implement the plan. Know wh ere the resources are going to beand how well they will be protec ted so the unit can judge whether  they will be readily availableand undamaged when the need for them arises. 162AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008A3.2.5.3.  Know the wing’s priorities for protecting its resour ces. These priorities may changedepending on the situation. For example, in a peacetime CONUS environment the wing may wantto prioritize support for the local  authorities during a natural disa ster. During combat overseas,however, the wing will probably not be willing to expend many of its assets to respond in supportof the civil authorities. Know what the wing wants to protect when, and how well it must be pro-tected. A3.2.6.  Other Sources of Information. Two other sources of information should be considered whenresearching a plan. A3.2.6.1.  On-Base Agencies. The wing plans office should be able to tell the unit all about thewing’s mission. Group and uni t planning offices will usually know their ca pabilities and weak-nesses and they will be able to tell the unit who owns what, where it is, and if it is protected. Withthem, CE may need to determine if the current level of protection is adequate. The wing’s support-ing intelligence shop and the Office of Special Investigation should be able to identify whom theenemies are. Security Forces, safety office, and FES should be able to help with records on majoraccidents or mishaps. The bioenvironmental engi neers, FES, and the logistics group’ s mainte-nance, supply and transportation units should be able to provide the location, quantities, commonuses, and transportation details of most hazardous materials on base. The supporting weather shopshould be able to provide information on the local natural disaster hazards. A3.2.6.2.  Off-Base Agencies. Consult with local Civil Defense, Red Cross (or Red Crescent),host nation civil and military auth orities, and other emergency response agencies and officials.This can help form a clear pict ure of the kinds of haz ardous materials transported near the baseand how often they pass. They may be able to provide a local history of the area’s natural disasters,major accidents, and intentional acts that caused significant damage (set forest fires, vandalism onfacilities, etc.). This consultation can also help  clarify what they think CE can do for them andwhat they can do for CE. The US Army Corps of Engineers can help determine the probability ofthe base suffering floods or other kinds of related disasters. USAF units with similar missions, orin similar areas, and the MAJCOM can provide guidance on the historical trends of incidents thathappen to bases in similar circ umstances or with similar mission s. If overseas, contact the unitsthat provide short range and point air defenses and perimeter security (if other than USAF securitypolice). A3.3.  STEP 2—Preparation. Plans are easier to use when the information and guidance is pertinent, con-cise, clearly written and intuitively  laid out. The best plans can be ruin ed by small things, like incorrectspelling, poor grammar, and misused punctuation. Poorly written plans lack validity to users, becausethey may feel that if it was not important enough to author correctly, it must not be important information. A3.3.1.  Content. Prepare a first draft. Keep it realistic, legal, and consistent with wing or higher head-quarter guidance. The plan must answer the classic five Ws: who, what, when, where, and why; some-times the plan may also need to address how. Discuss who will do what, when and where they will doit, why they will do it, how they will do it, and what they will use. The answers to these questions willchange at different stages of preparation, response, or execution. Provide answers to at least the fol-lowing questions. A3.3.1.1.  Who: A3.3.1.1.1.  Supports us? AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008163A3.3.1.1.2.  Do we support? A3.3.1.1.3.  Directs implementation or termination of which parts of the plan? A3.3.1.1.4.  Funds which parts of the plan? A3.3.1.1.5.  Commands or controls the resources (personnel, vehicles, supplies, materials, andequipment) that will be used to execute various parts of the plan? A3.3.1.1.6.  Will operate the equipment necessary to execute the plan? A3.3.1.1.7.  Will write what parts of the plan  and the supporting documents (checklists, ros-ters, equipment lists, diagrams, etc.)? A3.3.1.2.  What: A3.3.1.2.1.  Situation, or set of circumstances, is each part of the plan designed to handle? A3.3.1.2.2.  Are the basic assumptions? A3.3.1.2.3.  Specific duties, or  functions, are various agencies meant to perform in order toexecute the different parts of the plan? A3.3.1.2.4.  Resources (personnel, equipment, vehicles, supplies, or material) are the variousagencies meant to provide or employ to execute the different parts of the plan? A3.3.1.2.5.  Criteria will be used to judge progress of plan execution? A3.3.1.3.  When: A3.3.1.3.1.  Do different parts of the plan take effect? A3.3.1.3.2.  Will funds become available for each part of the plan? A3.3.1.3.3.  Must resources (personnel, equipment, vehicles, supplies, or material) be madeavailable, prepared, positioned, or employed in order to execute each part of the plan? A3.3.1.3.4.  Does the plan terminate? A3.3.1.3.5.  Does CE file which reports? A3.3.1.4.  Where: A3.3.1.4.1.  Do personnel perform their duties or functions to execute each part of the plan? A3.3.1.4.2.  Must resources (personnel, equipment, vehicles, supplies, or material) be assem-bled, stored, sent or employed to execute or terminate the plan? A3.3.1.4.3.  The unit sends what reports? A3.3.1.5.  Why: A3.3.1.5.1.  Does CE write and execute this plan (purpose of the plan)? A3.3.1.5.2.  Does CE perform certain aspects of this plan in a certain order? A3.3.1.6.  How: A3.3.1.6.1.  Will CE communicate or pass notification? A3.3.1.6.2.  Will CE evaluate the effectiveness of operations or the quality of work? 164AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008A3.3.1.6.3.  Should CE disperse resources? A3.3.1.6.4.  Does CE account for resources? A3.3.1.6.5.  Will CE protect resources? A3.3.1.6.6.  Does CE report operations, attack results, the wing’s status, etc.? A3.3.2.  Format. The format is specified in th e governing directives. For example, AFMAN 10-401,Volume 2, dictates the outline of an operation plan, and AFI 10-2501 provides the format for a disasteror accident plan. The format for each is similar. A3.3.3.  Style. Write the draft plan in a style easy to read. Common writing principles apply. Obtain acopy of AFH 33-337, The Tongue and Quill and use it. A3.4.  STEP 3—Coordination. Failure to properly coordinate a plan can cause confusion, consternation,and conflict. Plans should not come as a surprise to anyone except the enemy. A3.4.1.  Every agency that is tasked to participate in the plan should review and comment on it. A3.4.2.  Steps in Coordination. Revise the plan as necessary after eac h step in the coordination pro-cess. Some comments and recommendations for change are inappropriate or based on incorrect or out-dated information. If a suggested change is not made, contact the individual that requested the revisionand explain reasons for disapproving the modification. A3.4.2.1.  Have experts within the unit review a nd comment on the draft first. These individualsmay have an insight, experience, or knowledge th e author lacks. Their advice could improve theplan and save unit credibility. A3.4.2.2.  Obtain comments from functional experts.  These are the working level experts dealtwith regularly. They should be the most familiar  with their units’ abilities, responsibilities, andshortages. They help improve the plan and clear  up the details before it goes to commanders forreview. A3.4.2.3.  Obtain unit commanders’ co mments or approval. This is the opportunity for squadroncommanders to provide their thoughts and beliefs. They will usually  be particularly interested infunding, manpower, and equipment issues. They may need briefi ng a couple times before theyapprove the plan. Always brief the CE commander first. A3.4.2.4.  Receive coordination from local civil authorities, other services, and host nation equiv-alents when they are players. A3.4.2.5.  Obtain group commanders’ comments or approval. As with the squadron commanders,group commanders will want to interject their thoughts. They  may know less about the specificrules than the unit may, but they have a better view of the  “big picture.” Their comments mayreflect larger issues. A3.4.2.6.  Obtain wing commander’s comments or approval; this is the ultimate test. In general, ifthe plan gets this far there should be very little need for changes. Be ready to brief the wing com-mander if required, but only cove r the highlights. Go into details  when asked, so be prepared tocover them. The wing commander will probably have little knowledge of the mundane details, butwill be extremely familiar with MAJCOM requirements, overall policy, and direction. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008165A3.4.2.7.  Receive higher headquarters approval if necessary. Some of the plans may require coor-dination with higher headquarters, especially if in support of a particular contingency or crisis. A3.4.3.  Paperwork. Create a good paper  trail during the coordination process. The unit may need toreengage individuals and get additional clarification or request more changes. Most commanders wantproof that their experts reviewed and agreed with the plan bef ore they review and approve it. Thecover memorandum should inform  individuals why they are review ing the plan, the purpose of theplan, what parts of the plan they are to review, what they should do  if they have  questions or com-ments (do they contact CE, the OPR, write on the plan itself, or what?). In addition, it should let themknow when they should return the plan and to  whom, and any other info rmation they should know(background, pending changes to policy or procedures, etc.). A3.5.  STEP 4—Publication. Find out who locally is responsible for publishing the plan. If not CE, it maybe the responsibility of the wing plans office. They will usually require documentation of the plan reviewand make any required changes. They may also ask  the author to prepare DD Form 844, Requisition forLocal Duplicating Service. A3.6.  STEP 5—Review. Plans are never permanent. Plans require change for any number of reasons andscheduled reviews help keep plans  up to date. In general, conduct  reviews annually, when the threatchanges, when the mission changes, and when unit capabilities change. 166AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Attachment 4  OUR FOUNDATIONS: A HISTORY OF AIR FORCE CIVIL ENGINEERS A4.1.  A Proud Heritage. Air Force Civil Engineers have  a proud heritage tracing b ack to before WorldWar I. Originally, the engineering function was a small unit of the  Army Signal Corps and constructionwas handled through the Of fice of the Chief Signal  Officer. When the Air Se rvice was established in1918, the Building and Grounds Bran ch of the Division of  Military Aeronautics inherited maintenanceand construction responsibilities (in conjunction with the Construction Division of the War Department)for ten flying schools, one repair depot, and five  balloon schools. In 1921, cons truction of Air Serviceprojects was turned over to the Construction Service, Quartermaster Corps, working closely with the AirService (later Air Corps) Building and Grounds office. Throughout the 1930s, the Air Corps continued toslowly expand. The availability of Works Progress Administration (WPA) funds facilitated constructionthat otherwise would not have be en undertaken by the Air Corps. In 1940,  construction of Army AirCorps facilities in the Zone of In terior (the continental United States) was transferred to the Corps ofEngineers. For overseas construction, a new type of engineering organization was established. Figure A4.1.  Constructing Expedient Airfields During WWII. A4.2.  World War II. Long before Pearl Harbor, the growing Army Air Forces indicated the vital need forengineers specialized in the building of airfields overs eas in support of tactical  and strategic air opera-tions. The Air Forces needed their own engineers;  troops who trained with it, spoke its language andunderstood its needs. These men were to be trained and equipped to rapidly construct advanced airfieldsclose to or even behind en emy lines. They were also  to be trained to improve  and maintain the existingfacilities. They were to be skilled in the camouflage of airfields and the construction of defensive works.They were to be or ganized and prepared to repair airfields dama ged by enemy bombing. Fina lly, withtheir trained riflemen and machine gunners, they were to be prepared to take an active part in the defenseof their airdromes. Such was the concept of the Aviation Engineers—troops who were trained to con-struct, conceal, maintain and defend airfields. A4.2.1.  In June 1940, a handful of officers and 80 enlisted men assembled at Fort Benning, Georgia,to form the 21st Engineer (Aviation) Regiment, the first of its kind and the parent unit of the more than100,000 Aviation Engineers who served  in WWII. Originally established with 27 engineer of ficersAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008167and 761 enlisted men, each aviation engineer battalion was programmed for a lavish amount of equip-ment, including 220 items for construction and 146 vehicles—diesel tractors with bulldozers, carryallscrapers, graders, gasoline shovels, rollers, mixers, air compressors, drills, trucks, trailers, asphaltingand concreting equipment, rock crushers, draglines, and pumps—for its mission. To protect them-selves from air and ground attack, the Aviation Engineers were trained and equipped for combat aswell as construction. They were armed with a v ariety of weapons including bazookas, antitank andantiaircraft guns, grenade launchers, armed half-tracks, antitank mines and a full complement of smallarms. A4.2.2.  In addition to the regular aviation engineer battalions, airborne battalions were conceived inearly 1942 for mobile use in an invasion. Sixteen airborne aviation engineer battalions were organizedin 1943, each with a complement  of 28 officers and 500 men and light  equipment such as miniaturetractors, scrapers, rollers, a supply of weapons,  and radio equipment. These specialized units weredesigned to parachute into enemy territory, to establish an emergency strip, and, with light equipmentlanded by gliders, to im prove the runway until it could accommodate transports and tactical planes(Figure A4.2.). Figure A4.2.  Lightweight, Air Transportable Heavy Equipment in use during WW II. A4.2.3.  One of their successful operations occurred in North Africa. Major General James H. Doolit-tle, Commander, 12th Air Force, needed a dry base close to the front for his heavy bombers. BrigadierGeneral Donald A. Davison, Chief Engineer, Allied Forces, found a large sandy expanse near Biskra,deep in the Sahara. Because the conventional battalions were already busy on other projects, he calledin the airborne engineers. Troop transport planes carried the engineers and  their specially designedminiature equipment to Biskra, almost a thousand miles. They arrived on the evening of 13 Decemberand began work immediately. Twenty-four hours later, the first B-17 arrived from Oran. The bomberswere out of the mud and used th e base until the followi ng March, when spring winds blew sand insuch quantities as to make operations impossible. The airborne engineers also functioned as smoothlyand as efficiently as in a textbo ok exercise under conditions impossible for a  standard battalion inBurma and at Tsili Tsili in New Guinea. But, in general, their equipment was too light and the wholeconcept of their purpose was too specialized for  general use. Theater commanders greatly preferredthe standard battalion, and the air borne units sometimes sat idle or we re used in routine small jobs;eventually, many of them were either mer ged with other units or given no rmal size equipment and168AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008fought as standard battalions. The successes showed that there was some need for the airborne engi-neer unit but certainly not in the numbers which were formed. A4.2.4.  Immediately following the American entry into the war, aviation engineer units were sent toEngland to help service support  engineers prepare bases for the scores of planes which would soonfollow. The Aviation Engineers saw action in the deserts of Nort h Africa beginning in November1942. Four battalions stationed in England (809th,  814th, 815th, and 817th) ac companied the initialassault forces at Oran, Morocco. A4.2.5.  The battalions landed without incident and  usually without their equipment. The men of the814th walked 12 miles to their project site only to fill in holes, dig up duds, and remain idle becausetheir heavy equipment had been appropriated by another unit after being unloaded. The ship carryingthe 815th's equipment was sunk and the 809th's equi pment was on a ship that had developed enginetrouble 2 days out of England and turned back. A4.2.6.  When the units finally began their work in earnest, the major obstacle to constructing airfieldsalong the coasts of North Africa was not the German s or even the Italians, but “General Mud.” Theengineers had landed during the rainy season. General Davison described the construction of the air-drome at Tafaraoui, “To any aviation engineer in North Africa, the word Tafaraoui does not mean anairport alone, it means also a malignant quality of mud; something like wet concrete and of bottomlessdepth. We still speak of any bad type of mud as Tafaraoui.” A4.2.7.  Through active planning and  cooperation between engineer and planner, the Aviation Engi-neers were almost always at the  front lines, or sometimes even ahead of them. One night GeneralDavison was looking for the engineers of “B” company, 814th Battalion, when he was stopped by sen-tries from the 1st Armored Division,  “They stopped me a nd asked me if I knew  I was going out infront of their patrols. I said, ‘No that I didn't know that but I wanted to ask them one question—had acertain engineer company gone through and were they out in front?’  and they said ‘Yes, if you meanthose damn fools who wouldn’t pay any attention to us and took those big machines out, we think theyare about 10 or 15 miles down the  road.’ and I said, ‘That was what  I wanted to know.’ I found “B”company dug in with its defensive weapons in place  and already at work. It was by keeping in touchwith the planning…that we were able to do this.” A4.2.8.  The base at Bone, the easternmost port available to the Allies, was perhaps the most difficultbut probably the most rewarding to build. The only possible site for the all-weather airfield was a deltain the Seybouse River mouth. But the area was pure mud. The solution was to use sand available alongthe coast. Unfortunately, the sand dunes were on the opposite side of  the river from the constructionsite. The men constructed a causeway across the river, a roadway on the delta, and began to bring insand from the dunes. Although the s ite was under Axis air  attack, rain was the  enemy the engineersfeared most. A rare dry spell allowed the engineers to bring the sand across and finish the runway justhours before rain washed away the causeway. A4.2.9.  Shortly after completing the runway at Bone, the e ngineers received the most gratifying ofrewards. A B-26 returning from a  mission had become lost and was a bout to run out of fuel. Whileheaded for a ditching in the Mediterranean Sea, the pilot happened to glance down and see the “long-est runway he had seen in North Africa” at Bone. He made one sharp turn and landed without enoughgas left to taxi his plane off the runway (Figure A4.3.). AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008169Figure A4.3.  Bomber Landing on Completed Portion of Airstrip. A4.2.10.  The Aviation Engineers proved themselves in North Africa. By the end of the campaign theten battalions in theater had built or improved 129 airdromes. General Carl Spaatz, commander of theNorthwest African Air Forces, stated, “the Aviation Engineers have become as nearly indispensable tothe Army Air Force as is possible to ascribe to any single branch thereof.” A4.2.11.  The close working relationship forged between the engineers and the fliers in North Africacontinued in Sicily and Italy and was a key to the Allies’ success on the European continent. A4.2.12.  In the Sicilian campaign, the task of the Army Air Forces (AAF) engineers was to provideairstrips in support of the US Seventh Army, and though their officers had little advance knowledge ofconditions on the island, the Aviation Engineers were able to keep up with the whirlwind campaign.As it ended, the long-sought sepa rate organization came with the  formation of the AAF EngineerCommand, which was to serve as a model for the larger structure used later in the invasion of northernEurope. A4.2.13.  The invasion of Italy called first for  the familiar procedure of laying down emergencyfighter strips, in Calabria and then for Anzio. Later came the less spectacular but more lasting task ofbuilding all-weather fields for strategic bombers in Apulia and around Foggia; in both areas the heavyrains of “sunny” Italy caused serious but not insurmountable difficulties. By comparison, the assign-ments in Corsica and southern France in connection with the DRAGOON operation were routine. A4.2.14.  Operation OVERLORD’s planners recognized that airfield  availability would be a deter-mining factor in its success or failure. A tactical ai r force, to be truly ef fective, required airfields asclose to the front lines as possible to support a fluid and fast-moving operation. To provide these air-fields, a new organization was established, the IX  Engineer Command. Originally, no separate engi-neer command had been planned. However, because of the North African experience, where aviationengineers functioned as an integral part of the air force, Army Air Forces leaders such as LieutenantGeneral Lewis Brereton strongly pressed for an engineer  command. A provisional command con-ducted the training for the aviation engineer ba ttalions until March 30, 1944, when the IX EngineerCommand was activated. Four reg imental headquarters commanded sixteen battalions of engineers,while the command headquarters retained control of three airborne battalions and a camouflage battal-170AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008ion. Brigadier General James B. Newman beca me the Commander, IX Engineer Command ( FigureA4.4.). Figure A4.4.  Colonel Karl Shilling and General Newman at Construction Site. A4.2.15.  At 1050, 6 June 1944, first squad, third platoon of Company A of the 819th Engineer Avia-tion Battalion landed at Utah Beach, under the command of First Lieutenant Herbert H. Moore. Whenthe ramp was lowered, the engineers waded the final  200 yards to the beach in waist-deep water . AD-7 tractor followed closely behind and after that  came the second squad, th en a motor grader, thethird squad, another grader, a 2 1/2 ton truck, and finally another D-7 tractor. Men and equipment dis-persed on the beach with only one casualty  from shrapnel. Lieutenant Moore had to wait until theinfantry had taken the land for the emergency landing strip. Although the equipment had dispersed onwhat turned out to be  mud flats, it was extricated and reac hed the site by 1800. Work commencedimmediately and the engineers completed the strip by 2115 (Figure A4.5.). The men dug foxholes andspent their first night on the continent avoiding the considerable sniper fire. A4.2.16.  The landings at Omaha did not go as planned. Elements of the 834th, under the command ofLieutenant Colonel John Livingston, made repeated attempts to land at their scheduled location. Theirlanding craft grounded several times on beach obstacles in point blank fire. On D+1, the unit beachedat the nearest feasible location, several miles east of the planned site. The remaining elements of theunit landed at various locations up and down the coast. The scattered troops met at their in transit area,but found the planned sites for airfields still under enemy control. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008171Figure A4.5.  Expeditionary Airstrip Constructed During D-Day Invasion. A4.2.17.  The lead party of the 820th proceeded up Omaha Beach to within two miles from the shorewhen a Navy patrol ordered them to  return and stay clear of the Ge rman shelling of the beach. Laterin the afternoon, they succeeded in reaching the beach, but a shell struck close by just as the ramp wasbeing lowered, injuring several men from other units who were also in the craft, and seriously damag-ing the craft itself. They turned back and tied up to a landing ship, tank (LST) for the night. The nextmorning, another landing craft towed them to shore. A4.2.18.  The two  initially planned sites remained in enemy hands by D+2,  so the engineers of t he820th and 834th found another suitable location near St. Laurent-sur-Mer. They rapidly scraped out anemergency landing strip at the site, still waiting fo r the other sites to be taken. The Army made anurgent request for an airstrip to evacuate wounde d soldiers and receive emer gency supplies, so theengineers continued to develop the St. Laurent-sur-Mer emergency landing strip into a transport strip.By 2100 on D+2, they had constructed a 3,500 by 140-foot  runway that received its first aircraft thefollowing morning. For the next seve ral weeks, an average of 100  C-47s landed at the airfield daily.Although unplanned, this became the first operational American airfield in France. A4.2.19.  Engineers continued to construct airfields in the weeks fo llowing the invasion. Men of the816th marched 14 miles inland to the site of their planned airfield at Cardonville. They arrived in timeto help the Rangers clear the area of German soldiers, taking thirteen prisoners. On 13 June, they com-plete the new airfield that supported 500 fighter sorties in the first week. By the end of June, 11 Amer-ican airfields were in operation and five more  under construction. The original plans called forapproximately two-thirds of the airfields to be bu ilt to fighter specifications—a 3,600-foot runway.However, the Luftwaffe's ineffectual reaction to the invasion perm itted the Ninth Air Force to usetheir aircraft as fighter/ bombers, which dictated the construction of 5,000-foot runways. A4.2.20.  Aviation Engineers used three types of expedient runway materials during WW II: MarstonMat (known as Pierced Steel Planking or PSP),  Hessian Matting, and Square Mesh T rack. PSP was172AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008first tested at Langley Field, Virginia, in 1940. It was an example of design genius because of its sim-plicity, functionality, and endurance. Each section was 10 feet long, 15 inches wide, and weighed 66.2pounds. Originally manufactured as a solid plank  of ribbed steel, engineers decided that punchingholes would reduce the weight by  17.5 percent, help drain water a nd allow drying of the soil under-neath, permit backfill to be poured  into soft spots or depressions,  and contribute to camouflage anddust control by letting vegetation grow through the holes (Figure A4.6.). Figure A4.6.  Engineers Laying Pierced Steel Planking. A4.2.21.  Assembly of the PSP into a runway was  a simple process. Each  mat had thirty slots andL-shaped hooks on both long edges. One or two men dropped the hooks of one piece into the slots ofanother and then shoved it forward 2 inches, l ocking the pieces together. Easily removed U-shapedsteel clips provided further locking protection on the runway edge. The engineers laid the mat length-wise, across the runway, usually beginning in the middle and working towards both ends. As the avi-ation engineer troops became prof icient, they were able to lay  mat from both ends and the middlesimultaneously. Any discrepancy was solved by dragging sections into place with bulldozers. Thesubsurface was a variety of materials, depending on the projected permanence of the runway, locallyavailable materials, and the existing soil conditions. Leaves, palm branches, or straw created an effec-tive barrier reducing the dus t problem (Figure A4.7.). Repair of PSP was easy because the plankswere laid with the hooks on one row facing the opposite direction of the next row. Two men with prybars could remove a single mat or  repair it in place. If the base  below the PSP runway needed majorrepairs, large sections of planking could be rolled up to allow equipment to make the repairs. The run-way could then simply be unrolled. At the end of the war, two million tons of PSP had been manufac-tured, enough to build nearly a thousand 150- by 5,000-foot runways. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008173Figure A4.7.  Using Straw Under PSP to Control Dust. A4.2.22.  Prefabricated Hessian Surfacing, known as Hessian Matting, was a common runway mate-rial used on the continent of Eur ope following the D-Day Invasion. It was a Hessian cloth (a type ofburlap) coated with bitumen that had no load bearing capacity, but served as a waterproof cover for thegrade (Figure A4.8.). Figure A4.8.  Square Mesh Track Being Unrolled on Top of Hessian Matting. A4.2.23.  Hessian Matting was laid in long itudinal strips, using a 50-percent overlap, thus giving adouble thickness throughout. To facilitate accurate overlapping, the material had a red center line. TheBritish developed a machine known as a “Stamplicker” to lay the matting. This device applied solvent(usually diesel fuel) to the bottom of the material as it unrolled off the truck onto the ground. The endsof the rolls were stapled together as they passed through the machine to make one long strip. Becausethese runways were slippery when wet, engineers sprayed the completed runway with diesel fuel andapplied a coating of sand that  was rolled into the surface by rolle rs. This provided an ef fectiveanti-skid surface. 174AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008A4.2.24.  Aviation engineers needed a temporary surfa cing material for airfields to be used by lightand medium weight aircraft. The r unway material had to be lightwe ight, easily transportable, andquickly laid. In 1944, th ey began experimenting with concrete reinforcing mesh manufactured inEngland. Square Mesh Track had initial problems with excessive billo wing and a failure of clips tohold the material together. The solution was to stretch the Square Mesh Track by pulling it with trucksand crimping individual wires. A4.2.25.  Square Mesh Track's greatest advantage was its light wei ght. Square Mesh Track requiredonly 250 tons of material for a 120- by 3,600-foot runway, compared to 1,150 tons for PSP. Engineersunrolled the track either by hand or by pushing it in front of a jeep. As engineers tried different meth-ods, they found that Square Mesh Track laid on top of Hessian Matting provided a satisfactory runwaymaterial. When rain and snow caused PSP to be adopted as the main surfacing material, Square MeshTrack was used in many of the “Sandwich” jobs  that included Hessian Matting, Square Mesh Track,and PSP (Figure A4.9.). Figure A4.9.  “Sandwich” Runway Surface. A4.2.26.  From D-Day until V -E Day the activities of IX Engineer co mmand were intimatelyentwined with those of the tactical air forces and, indeed, with those of the ground troops. Along withother invading forces, the engineers were hampered by the rugged re sistance of the Germans at thebeaches and in Normandy; their schedules were disrupted by the slow breakout from the Cotentin andequally by the unexpectedly rapid advance thereafter. Important changes in plans were required by theneed for more fighter-bomber fields than had b een predicted and by the  decision to base mediumbombers on the Continent. A4.2.27.  As the First and Third Armies moved across France  supported by, respectively, the IX andXIX Tactical Air Commands, the Engineer Command was split into the lst and 2nd Engineer AviationBrigades, each with the duty of providing the advancing armies a series of airfields in immediate sup-port. Supply and transportation were never adequate, and aviation engineers were hard put to keep upwith the breakneck pace of the ground troops. By V-E Day, 8 May 1945, nearly 250 airfields had beenconstructed or reconditioned for Allied use from Normandy to Austria and Czechoslovakia; 182 werestill in use on V-E Day. During their peak period, the IX Engineer Command put an airfield into ser-vice every 36 hours (Figure A4.10.). AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008175Figure A4.10.  Assault Airfield Nearing Completion—Started From Each End. A4.3.  Pacific Theater. Aviation Engineers saw action quite early during the War in the Pacific. The 803rdBattalion endured a 5-month journey to the Philippines in 1941, arriving just a few weeks before the Jap-anese attacked. The men repaired  airfields, scraped out emergency runways and performed whateverengineering work was required. They soon found themselves serving as infantry troops, turning back aJapanese suicide attack at one point. The Japanese captured two of the companies on Bataan, with Com-pany A managing to evade escape and reach Corregi dor. These engineers became consumed in the des-perate and unsuccessful campaign to keep Kindley Fiel d operational, and eventually became one of thelast units to surrender to  the overwhelming Japanese attacked at Corregidor. The Aviation Engineeringcompanies captured at Corregidor and Bataan would become part of and suffer through one of the greatestatrocities of World War II during the Bataan Death March. During this march the Aviation Engineers andother US Army units, over 75,000 personnel in all, were marched nearly 100 miles to Camp O’Donnell, aUS constructed Philippine Training base captured by the Japanese. A4.3.1.  In the Pacific and Chi na-Burma-India (CBI) theaters, Aviation Engineers constructed air-fields on coconut-forested atolls and in steamy jungles (Figure A4.11.), as the American forces closedin on the Japanese homeland supporting MacArt hur’s island hopping campaign. The engineers wereoften forced to abandon their construction equipment and pick up their weapons to defend their posi-tions against the Japanese. In few instances were the Aviation Engineers in the Pacific areas or in theCBI able to call on the resources of an industrial society. Their supply problems were compounded bydistance and low priorities. In the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA), Aviation Engineers began theiroperations at Darwin in Australia early in 1942 and finished fa r to the north as  the war ended. Fromthe first, they worked side by side with Army and Navy engineers. A4.3.2.  Aviation engineers on the other front of the Pa cific campaign fought extreme climatic andaustere supply chains to create an aerial supply route across the Himalayas supporting British, Indian,Chinese, and American forces facing the Japanese. These airfields were critical to the support of these176AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008actions since the engineers constructing the overland route were faced with a virtually impassable bar-rier of mountains, rivers and jungles. Figure A4.11.  Airstrip Being Cut Out of a Tropical Jungle. A4.3.3.  As SWPA forces held at Port Moresby a nd then began the slow movement northward, eachjump in the hopscotch pattern of advance depended upon the previous development of new air bases.The terrain often was rugged, living conditions were extremely primitive, and the climate was debili-tating and unhealthy. Sites for airfields had to be  chosen based on inadequate information, and landtransportation was incredibly difficult. These factors made for the unorthodox methods, and in manycases, the standards accepted for airstrips were far different from those demanded in the CONUS or inthe European theater of operations. But, whatever the book may have said, the strips laboriously hewnout of jungles or la id on coral islands ( Figure A4.12.) still under enemy fire  usually stood up to thepragmatic test of hard use. Road building frequently became a necessary adjunct to airfield construc-tion, and more often than they liked, aviation engineers were employed in miscellaneous tasks bearinglittle relation to the air war. A4.3.4.  Occasionally, advance intelligence was so faulty as to require a radical revision of plans, as atHollandia, where designs for a huge complex of bases to be built by 25,000 Aviation Engineers werescaled down to a minimum, with most of the force moving on to develop an airfield on another islandinstead. In regard both to construction supplies and provisions for their own existence, Aviation Engi-neers felt that they suffered unduly while the Seabees lived a life of plenty; they also felt some resent-ment when the highly publici zed Seabees received wide acclaim  for accomplishments no differentfrom those of the unsung Aviation Engineers. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008177Figure A4.12.  Airstrip Constructed on Pacific Coral Island. A4.3.5.  With the return to the Philippines, Aviation Engineers passed a crucial test under fire in themud of Leyte, and then moved northward to Mind oro and Luzon, where a variety of tasks necessaryfor the restoration of those islands competed with  airfield construction for the attention of the e ngi-neers. A4.3.6.  In the North Pacific the Japanese threat of June 1942 seemed to reinforce ideas about the stra-tegic importance of Alaska and to  demand the immediate extension of ai r facilities in the area. As apoint of attack against Japanese-held Kiska and  Attu, two companies of Aviation Engineers built ausable airfield on Adak, Amchitka, and Attu work ing under the extreme climatic conditions imagin-able. A4.3.7.  In the China-Burma-India theater , the activities of the Aviation Engineers were as far fromnormal as were most operations in that vast theater of operations. In China there were no US aviationengineer units and only a handful of officers to advise General Chennault, and to some extent, the Chi-nese who built his airfields. In India the T enth Air Force used fields prepared by native labor underBritish supervision. Until 1944, all five aviation engineer battalions in CBI were assigned to work onthe Ledo Road, where they were joined later by thr ee other battalions. Their fine work was finishedonly with the completion of the ro ad early in 1945. Though some units then moved into China, theyarrived too late to accomplish much before Victory in Japan or V-J Day. Perhaps the most nearly nor-mal project in the theater was when Aviation Engineers, under AAF control, supported the campaignin Burma and developed the important complex of bases around Myitkyna. A4.3.8.  The task of preparing bases for the B-29s of the XXI Bomber Command in the Marianas wasone of the largest jobs Aviation Engineers faced during the Pacific campaign, but it went smoothly .Fifteen battalions were available for developing the islands. Plans based on insufficient data had to bemodified frequently. Nevertheless, the B-29 fields with their then generous airfield criteria were builtin time to accommodate the constantly expanding force of heavy bombers. An even greater construc-tion project, involving the use of 93 aviation engi neer battalions, was planned for Okinawa but was178AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008canceled when Japan surrendered. Had World War II continued a few months longer, many of the vet-eran aviation engineer units of the European theater would have been assigned to this mammoth con-struction program. Instead, most of the Aviation Engineers went home and after discharge participatedin the greatest building boom in American history. A4.3.9.  During most of World War II, general service engineers known as Post Engineers carried outmaintenance and repair of Army Air Forces installations. At the end of the war, 1,435 airfields locatedin 67 foreign countries had been used, built, or improved for or by the Army Air Forces. In the Zoneof Interior, 504 airfields were on an active status and 136 on a temporary inactive status. A4.3.10.  When the Air Force became a separate service in 1947, Air Force construction continued tobe programmed and budgeted by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Air Force Civil Engineer functionoperated as the Directorate of Installations under  the Deputy Chief of S taff, Materiel. At the baselevel, the Air Installation Officer was responsible for the repair and maintenance of installation facili-ties, grounds, and utilities. A4.3.11.  Early in WW II (38, 39, and 40) the Army High Command took a long look at itself and sawthat serious reorganization was required to fight the war that  was coming. Among the changes madewas the reassignment of the Army Fire Department responsibility from the Quartermaster Corps to theCorps of Engineers (COE) on 4 December 1941, three  days before Pearl Harbor. The COE inheritedan existing program and assumed all would roll along comfortably. On December 7 the COE discov-ered it would have to fight fire around the world with soldiers and with equipment designed for Stateside Army posts. During the next 6 months COE  studied, designed, and planned their overseas firedepartments. On 1 July 1942, the Engineer Fire Fighting Detachment (EFFD) and the Army Engineersoldier fire fighter (military occupational specialty, or MOS, 383) were authorized for activation. Thefirst 10 EFFDs were activ ated at Camp Claiborne Louisiana on  31 August 1942.  The cadre of eachDetachment was drawn largely from Infantry units with the hope that at least some of them had somefire fighting experience. Very few did. The balance of the staffing was Selective Service inductees.The first 4 EFFDs (1, 2, 4 and 5) deployed 1 April 1943 to North Africa, 3, 6, 7, 8 to North Africa and9 and 10 followed them shortly  to England. The Detachments brought only personal gear and weap-ons. Vehicles and everything else was drawn on arrival. A4.3.12.  On 15 August 1943 these 10 EFFDs, and maybe more if more had trained and deployed bythat date, were renumbered and renamed to th e 1201st through 1210th Engineer Fire Fighting Pla-toons (EFFP). They were organized and equipped per T/O & E 5-337, 12 M ay 1943, Engineer FireFighting Platoon. It is here that  these EFFPs would divide by func tion. EFFPs being general servicefire fighters and the Engineer Aviation Fire Fighting Platoons (EAFFP) that would come a bit laterappeared. The units were identical in officer and enlisted staffing and support vehicles. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008179Figure A4.13.  Military Fire Trucks 1940s. A4.3.13.  Fire protection  has been a critical part of the Air  Force Civil Engineering since January1945, when War Department Circular No. 36 transfer red all crash rescue a nd firefighting activitiesand equipment from the Army Service Forces to the AAF. At HQ AAF, fire protection was assignedto the Assistant Chief of Staff, Materiel and Services, Air Installations Division. A4.3.14.  At the base, structural fi refighting was under the post engin eer, while aircraft crash rescue(Figure A4.14.) reported to the aircraft maintenance officer. In 1949, these were placed under the AirInstallation Officer. The two functions were integrated under a single Air For ce specialty code in1953. Figure A4.14.  Firefighters Practicing a New Crash Rescue Technique (1945). A4.4.  Korean War. The Korean War presented tremendous challenges for Air Force engineers. Althoughthe Air Force had become a separa te entity under the National Security Act of 1947, it did not possess aseparate and unique engineering capability. In response to a significant airfield engineering and construc-tion need, the US Army created Special Category Army personnel with Air Force, or SCARWAF. SCAR-WAF troops were responsible for the construction, upgrading, expansion, and rehabilitation of airfieldsand operated under the Command of USAF control until 1951 when the Army resumed control and train-ing. In 1951, the organization had the Air Force furnishing funding an d manpower authorizations whilethe Army organized, trained, and equipped SCARWAF engineer units and then placed them under AirForce control. 180AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008A4.4.1.  This confusing concept led to a number of problems that hampered the engineers throughoutthe war. At the beginning of the Korean War SCARWAF battalions combat effectiveness was rated atapproximately 15% of the World War II Aviation Engineer battalions. Commanders and personnelassigned to SCARWAF units felt they belonged to neither the Air Force nor  the Army as neitheragency took responsibility for maintaining an effective and equipped engineering force. A4.4.2.  A SCARWAF battalion initially had an aut horized strength of 800 men. In July 1951, eachbattalion increased to 977 personnel . During the first ye ar of the war, most units were woefully illequipped and under strength. The  manning they did possess was often poorly tr ained and inexperi-enced. A4.4.3.  Two SCARWAF groups were assigned to the First Construction Command, Fifth Air Force.The 930th EAG Headquarters and Se rvice Company oversaw civilian construction while militaryconstruction would be handled by the 931st EAG, assigned to 12th AF, with units located in Guam andOkinawa. This unit was disbanded in December 1950 and the Fifth Air Force Director of Installationswas given command of both SCARWAF troops and installation squadrons. A4.4.4.  Company A of the 802d E ngineer Aviation Battalion (EAB) was the first Aviation Engineerunit to land in Korea, coming from Okinawa. Beginning on 11 July 1950, engineers rehabilitated theairfield at Pohang, using World War II-vintage equipment. They put a 500-foot PSP extension on theeast end of the runway and constructed a 40-foot wide taxiway with 27 hardstands for P-51 Mustangs.In early August, the engineers left their equipment and joined the infantry to defend the base againstadvancing North Korean troops. A4.4.5.  The 822d EAB arrived from Okinawa on 30 July with orders to repair the existing PSP run-way without hindering current air operations and mission generation at Taegu Airfield. It had one sodrunway, 4,000 feet long. Working around the clock, engineers, aide d by 500 Korean workers, laid4,300 linear feet of a new PSP runway and went  to work on the existing parallel runway . On 16August, North Korean forces attacked T ageu forcing the EAG to evacuate to Pusan. Returning amonth later, the engineers completed the runway to a length of 6,215 feet with a 1,000-foot stabilizedoverrun. This allowed F-80 jet aircraft and heavy C-119 transports to use the airfield. The 811th EABput Kimpo and Suwon airfields back into service just 10 days following the Inchon invasion. This pat-tern of construction, coming under  attack, retreating and having to  re-accomplish their work was apoint of constant frustration for EAG personnel. A4.4.6.  During the early stages of the Korean War, the low level of readiness of the SCARWAF avi-ation engineer units seriously affected the conduct of air operations. This problem was compoundedby the introduction of several new aircraft. Newer aircraft such as the F-80 and C-124 required longerand wider runways, larger taxiways and parking aprons, increased  pavement thickness, and morestringent design criteria for gradients and clear zones. Larger fuel and munitions storage, and moresupport facilities were requirements that added to the burden. The result of the technological advance-ments in aircraft in Aviation Engineering terms was a much lar ger construction effort required toexpand and support existing and new Korean airfields . In World War II, airfield construction wasexpressed in terms of battalion days or weeks; in Korea, it was battalion months. A4.4.7.  Other factors contributed to the reduced capabilities  of SCARWAF Aviation Engineers dur-ing the early months of the conflict. Although the Far East Air Forces had 3,600 SCARWAF authori-zations, only 2,322 were filled, and their equipment consisted of obsolete leftovers from World War II.These handicaps resulted in concentrating initial  construction effort on upgrading South Korean andAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008181WWII Japanese-built airfields. The newer, heavier and more performance driven aircraft of theKorean conflict quickly exceeded the design capabilities of the WWII airfields causing degradation,deterioration and increased maintenance and repair requirements.  The Aviation Engineers attemptedto solve the problem by overlaying the thin conc rete surfaces with PSP without addressing the poorbearing capacity of the runway subgrade. The PSP overlay method was ef fective to support fighteroperations but collapsed and failed under the weight of transport a nd bombers due to the inadequatesub grade bearing capacity. Operations had to continue to support combat operations, and as reportedat the time, the PSP “rolled and buckled, clips worked loose and lacerated aircraft tires, while the per-forated surface slowed the planes and increased the takeoff roll” (Figure A4.15.). Figure A4.15.  Damaged PSP Being Repaired. A4.4.8.  Since PSP was the only means of providing expedient airfield surfaces, the existing stock (5million square feet) was soon depleted. By September 1950, with a supplemental shipment of another5 million square feet, 8 .3 million square feet of  PSP matting had been laid  in Korea and Japan. ByDecember 1950, losses as a result of the Chinese Communist Forces offensive and other emergencyrequirements had once again depleted PSP supplies. A4.4.9.  December 1950 saw the Communist Chinese Forces launch a massive counter offensive overthe Yalu River. By the end of the month UN forces and positions started to retreat and fall. During thisretreat the 822nd EAB working around Pyongyang were  forced to retreat. During this action the822nd lost 75% of its equipment when an ammuni tion rail car exploded in capacitating the rails. ByJanuary 1951, the Chinese Communist Forces advance had been halted and UN forces began to takethe offensive. UNC forces established a static forward battle line along the 38th parallel that becamethe main battlefield for the next two years. A4.4.10.  As the war entered into this stage, the lack of training, manpower, and worn-out equipmentstill plagued the aviation engineer units, severely degrading construction efforts. The acute shortage ofrepair parts and mechanics, and equipment abuse by untrained operators further aggravated an alreadydifficult situation. A4.4.11.  The assessment of the e ngineers’ role and accomplishments during the first 2 years of warwas generally disappointing. The official Air Force history of the Korean War stated: “In two years of182AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008war in Korea no single factor had so seriously handicapped Fifth Air Force operational capabilities asthe lack of adequate air facilities.” A4.4.12.  Recognizing the problem of SCARWAF training, all CONUS training was placed under thecontrol of the Continental Air Command and the Aviation Engineer Force was established. Ten avia-tion engineer units with a total strength of 3,484 personnel were assigned to Aviation Engineer Force.The creation of the Aviation Engineer Force was an  important first step to correct the training prob-lems, but it was far short of solving them all. It took 2 years after the start of the war, until June 1952,for the Fifth Air Force to attain its required aviation engineer capability of 10 battalions. A4.4.13.  Considering the many difficulties encountered by SCARWAF units during the conflict, theirmany accomplishments are doubly impressive. Duri ng the early stages, Aviation Engineers usedexpedient methods to get as many airfie lds operational as possible; it  was the only  viable optionbecause time, manpower, equipment and materials were limited. As the frontlines stabilized in 1951,and more manpower became available, the effort shifted toward more durable construction methods.At Taegu, Kunsan, and Suwon 9,000-foot semi-permanent runways were built to last at least 2 years.From this point on, the construction effort in Korea increased dramatically. By the end of the war, Avi-ation Engineers had built or repaired 55 separate  airfields from which the Air Force flew nearly700,000 sorties. A4.4.14.  Installation squadrons operated and maintain ed the airfields. The squadron's three of ficersand 60 enlisted troops, supplemented by 300-400 Korean laborers, constructed prefabricated build-ings, established utility systems, and provided fire protection. Working in concert with aviation engi-neer battalions, the installation squadrons transforme d airfields into airbases. Engineers constructedhousing, administrative facilities, operational and  maintenance structures at South Korean bases tosupport prolonged operations. They also deployed forward to assist in the operation of temporary air-fields near the front lines during the fluid portion of the war. A4.4.15.  Even with lo nger and wider runways, jet aircraft co ntinued to be lost during takeoff andlanding operations. The Air Force decided to test the application of an aircraft arresting barrier systemsimilar to the Davis barri er used on aircraft carriers. The system adopted by the Air Force, theMA-1A, consisted of retractable stanchions which held the barrier in position and heavy anchor chainto decelerate the aircraft when it engaged the barrier (Figure A4.16.). In the first two weeks of use atTaegu, three F-84s (costing $200,000 each) were saved by the arresting system, which cost $17,000.Within six months of operation, the MA-1A had saved 36 aircraft through active engagements. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure A4.16.  MA-1A Aircraft Barrier. 183A4.4.16.  Problems relating to heavy equipment centered around lack of standardization and, at leastduring the early stages of the c onflict, operator training. Equipment obsolescence and insufficientreplacement parts presented difficulties as well. A4.4.17.  Training deficiencies in the SCARWAF units posed a ma jor problem throughout the con-flict. Once the Aviation Engineer Force had trained ten of the rotational uni ts, proficiency improvedconsiderably. In its after action report, the Aviation Engineer Force concluded “...the Air Force had avital need for aviation forces which were not combat engineers nor construction engineers but special-ists in the art of building airfields.” A4.4.18.  Following the war, the Air Force requested permission to organize its own engineering func-tion and transfer the 30,000 SCARWAF engineers from the Army. In 1955, however, the Secretary ofDefense decided to leave the engineers with the  Army and abolish the SCARWAF, thus leaving theAir Force without its ow n combat engineers until the estab lishment of the RED HORSE program in1965. A4.5.  A Professional Force. The 1950s were a period of significant growth in the basing of the Air Force.The elevation of the Directorate of  Installations to Assistant Chief  of Staff level from 1954 to 1957 wasindicative of the increased engineering activities related to the massive strategic forces buildup. A4.5.1.  With the beginning of operational planning for the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM),the civil engineering activity was  reorganized to provide for de sign and construction supervision ofmissile ground support facilities. The designer of th e missile ground environment had to work in anintegrated fashion with the designer of the missile itself. When the ICBM became a part of the aero-space force, it automatically introduced engineering considerations as a major element for the se lec-tion and employment of weapon systems and resulted in an incr ease in the scope and volume of AirForce engineering. The construction  of dispersed missile sites at va rious bases presented significantdifficulties in the areas of operations, maintenance and fire protection. A4.5.2.  The design and construction  of the Dye radar sites, Ballis tic Missile Early Warning Systemand Distant Early Warning Line (Figure A4.17.) installations presented many challenges. Extendingfrom Greenland to Alaska, these  sites were constructed under conditi ons that had never before beenencountered and required ingenuity and perseverance to complete. 184AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure A4.17.  Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line Facilities. A4.5.3.  In 1954, Air Force engineers  began construction of the new  Air Force Academy near Colo-rado Springs, Colorado. The Ai r Force Academy Construction Agen cy was created to oversee thework. The new institution reflected  the role that aeros pace power would play in the future ( FigureA4.18.). Figure A4.18.  Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado A4.5.4.  Air Force Engineer leaders stressed professionalism and registration in the 1950s and 1960s.In 1959, the Air Force Director of Installations was renamed the Director of Civil Engineering. At thebase level, Air Installation Of ficers became Installation Engineers (and later, Base Civil Engineers).This demonstrated the change in the perception of Air Force Engi neers from “handymen” to profes-sionals. A4.6.  Southeast Asia Conflict. In the 1960s, Air Force Engineers responded to several emergencies andthe growing American commitment in Southeast Asia and as a result, gave the Air Force the contingencyAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008185capability necessary to respond worldwide. The Lebanon crisis of 1958, Berlin crisis of 1961, and CubanMissile Crisis of 1962 demonstrated a need for mobile civil engineer teams ready for immediate deploy-ment to perform construction work during wartime or other emergencies. A HQ USAF study group rec-ommended that Prime BEEF (base  engineer emergency force) teams be created to respond worldwidewhen needed. A4.6.1.  As the Indochina War ended with the depa rture of French forces, Communist activities inSoutheast Asia started to gain the  attention of the United S tates. By late 1961, the insurgency in theRepublic of South Vietnam began to threaten the country's continued existence. A decision was madeto increase the US military advisory contingent. The buildup of personnel and equipment drove a con-current requirement for new construction. Some PACAF civil engineers were deployed on temporaryduty (TDY) to Vietnam to establish tent camps and basic support  facilities as interim measures untilpermanent facilities could be constructed by cont ract. Other civil engineers on TDY also providedoperations and maintenance support at several locations in Sout h Vietnam. The US Military Assis-tance Command, Vietnam (USMACV) had initial respon sibility for contract construction that thenshifted to the Navy. As the construction effort continued to grow, the in-country contractor capabilitywas soon saturated, while pressure to get the work  done increased constantly. After PresidentJohnson's statement on 4 August 1964 that the US would honor its commitment to South Vietnam, theUS buildup of forces in Southeast Asia started to shift into high gear. The number of Air Force person-nel and aircraft deployed to Tan Son Nhut, Bien Hoa, and Da Nang soon saturated these air bases. Asa later study would show, the Army, as required by Department of Defense (DOD) Directive, had nodedicated units to meet Air For ce troop construction requirements in an overseas theater . The AirForce, prohibited by that same directive from having its own wartime capability, had to rely on civil-ian contractors to provide its facilities for combat mission support. A4.6.2.  New bases became operational as the buildu p continued, but the flow  of CE forces did notkeep pace, at least not until 1966. The BCEs relied on indigenous labor to provide beddown facilitiesfor the incoming forces. Billets were not standardized and ranged from hardback tents to “Bien Hoa”huts, or whatever could be put together quickly with the skills available. Billeting was a minor prob-lem compared to the constantly  increasing challenges that confronted the BCEs. Water shortages inthe dry season followed by floods during the monsoons; sanitation hazards; heavy demands on powergeneration and utilities, maintenance of aircraft barrier systems; and daily flightline emergencies weresome of the major concerns. Becau se of the climatic ef fect on equipment and temporary facilities,constant maintenance became a heavy burden. During the Vietnam War, firefighters formed Pedrounits, comprising airborne firefighters who responded to crash scenes away from a base. Air Force fireprotection in Southeast Asia was  the busiest fire protection organization in the world, responding tonearly 100,000 emergency calls a year. A4.6.3.  While CE forces had received no specific wa r fighting training prior to their Southeast Asiaassignment, they nevertheless demonstrated the capability that was necessary to support the combatmission until better capabilities could be develope d. The Prime BEEF program implemented in late1964 was to fill the need; it was put to the test just a few months later. A4.6.4.  Lack of parking space and a rapid buildup in numbers made it necessary to park aircraft closetogether on existing ramps. The absence of shelters, with only a few protective revetments available,made aircraft highly vulnerable to accidental explosions and enemy attack. In May 1965, at Bien Hoa,the inevitable happened when a bomb accidentally exploded on a B-57 parked among a cluster of air-craft (Figure A4.19.). The sympathetic detonations that followed killed or injured 105 personnel and186AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008destroyed or damaged 45 aircraft. Some form of  protection from a similar accident or enemy actionhad to be found. Figure A4.19.  B-57s Damaged and Destroyed, Bien Hoa Vietnam. A4.6.5.  After prototype testing at Eglin AFB, Florida, the Air Force decided on a steel bin revetmentfilled with compacted soil to  provide the needed protection. Unable to obtain engineer support fromthe heavily committed Army to meet Air Force requirements (including revetment construction), threeCONUS-based, 28-person Prime BEEF teams were deployed to construct revetments at Bien Hoa,Tan Son Nhut, and Da Nang. This group of three teams was known as Prime BEEF I. By the time their120-day TDY ended in December 1965, Prime BEEF I  had many accomplishments to their credit,including more than 12,000 linear feet of  revetment constructed at three bases ( Figure A4.20.). Notonly had they provided greater protection for combat aircraft, these teams validated the Prime BEEFconcept. Wartime necessity had given Air Force Civil Engineers a war fighting capability. A4.6.6.  Other groups of  Prime BEEF teams follo wed to accomplish vital mi ssion support projects.Prime BEEF II, an 18-person plumbi ng team laid over 2 miles of water lines at T an Son Nhut; pro-vided nine latrines and constructed sewer mains, septic tanks, and leaching fields. A4.6.7.  Prime BEEF III arrived in October 1965; composed of six teams with a total strength of 225men, these teams were tasked to support the beddown of new Air Force units. Working with BCEs atvarious bases, each of these depl oyments was a success that attracted the attention of the leadership.By 1968, over 1,600 personnel from nearly 60 individual Prime BEEF teams had responded to supporturgent facility requirements in Southeast Asia. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008187Figure A4.20.  Aircraft A-2 Bin Revetments, Vietnam Era. A4.6.8.  A more permanent capability was required to meet the heavy construction and repair capabil-ity supporting the rapid force buildup in Southeast Asia. On 10 May 1965, Secretary of Defense Rob-ert McNamara asked Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert if the Air Force had the capabilityto construct expeditionary airfields and, if not, what could be  done to develop such a capability . InAugust 1965 the organization of Civil Engineering Squadrons (Heavy Repair) was proposed and twosquadrons were requested for assignment to PACAF. The mortar attack on Bien Hoa during may 1965,when 11 aircraft were damaged, intensified the concern and need for a greater organic capability. Onemonth after the proposal was made, the T actical Air Command was tasked to or ganize, train, equip,and prepare two squadrons for deployment to S outh Vietnam. Called Rapid Engineer DeployableHeavy Operational Repair Squadron, Engineerin g (RED HORSE), these squadrons were to beself-contained units with their  own equipment and supplies, capable of deploying anywhere in theworld. RED HORSE squadrons were to maintain their own identity when operating in the field. A4.6.9.  The first two units were  designated the 554th (P enny Short) and the  555th (Triple Nickel)Civil Engineering Squadrons, Heavy Repair (CES [HR]). By 15 December  1965, training of theseunits was underway at Cannon AFB, New Mexico; “graduation” took place on 26 January 1966. Evenbefore training was completed,  all of the 390 items of construc tion equipment to support the twosquadrons were ready for shipment at the Gulfport, Mississippi port of embarkation; it was an extraor-dinary feat accomplished in just 85 days  after Warner Robins Air Materiel  Area had been tasked toprovide this equipment. A4.6.10.  The two RED HORSE Squadrons arrived in South Vietnam in February 1966 with the 554thassigned to Phan Rang AB and the 555th going to Cam Ranh Bay. A4.6.11.  The 554th at fi rst concentrated on repair of the aluminum matting runway where severerains and poor initial construction had caused the subbase to fail. Repair was accomplished by exca-vating to depths of up to 8 feet and replacing subgrade material, installing sub drains, and laying newbase course material. The work proceeded without interruption of air operations. Later the 554th builtaircraft shelters, shops and other support structures, constructed NAVAID facilities and taxiways, andinstalled aircraft arresting barriers. A4.6.12.  The 555th RED  HORSE Squadron performed similar ta sks to maintain continued flyingoperations at Cam Ranh Bay; they were also ac tive in new facility construction and improvement ofroads and the utility systems. 188AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure A4.21.  RED HORSE Engineers at Tuy Hoa Beach. A4.6.13.  By the end of 1966, six RE D HORSE units had been organized and deployed to SEA. The556th arrived at U Tapao AB, Thailand, at the beginning of July 1966 and engaged primarily in build-ing construction. Members of the squadron also completed work at five other bases in Thailand. The819th’s role in Vietnam was unique among RED HORSE squadrons in that it deployed to an undevel-oped area, classified as unsecured, to establish a base camp without recourse to any base support func-tions. The mission of the squadron  was to construct the buildings  at Phu Cat while the constructioncombine of Raymond International, Morrison-Knudsen, Brown and Root, and J.A. Jones (RMK/BRJ)constructed the airfield. Phu Cat became the one base in So uth Vietnam at which almost all buildingconstruction and a great percentage of earthen and paving constr uction was accomplished by a REDHORSE squadron—the 819th. The 820th deployed to Tuy Hoa AB in October 1966. This unit com-pleted nearly 50 percent of all construction completed at Tuy Hoa, including: 170 aircraft protectiverevetments, 120,000 square feet of wooden buildings, and 175,000 square yards of AM-2 matting. Inaddition, the 820th operated a rock  crusher 9.5 miles from the base  and hauled aggregate throughenemy-held territory to the base. The 823d reported to Bien Hoa AB in October 1966. Operating outof Bien Hoa, the squadron reorganized into four self-sufficient units. By January 1967, deployed unitswere in place at Tan Son Nhut, Vung Tau, Da Nang, and Pleiku, while a unit remained at Bien Hoa. A4.6.14.  As the many RED HORSE  squadrons were beginning to  prove their capabilities as a warfighting engineering force, they were organized into the 1st Civil Engineering Group directed by the7th Air Force Civil Engineer. These squadrons carried out major c onstruction on several bases andcompleted much of the vertical work left undone  by the contractors. RED HORSE squadrons con-structed nearly 400 concrete aircraft shelters  at six bases in South Vietnam between 1967 and 1969.The RED HORSE squadrons succeeded in making the  bases safer and much  more livable for AirForce personnel. A4.6.15.  The first RED HORS E units deployed to Southeast Asia  for 1-year tours. However, therewas no program for training replacem ent personnel for the initial cadre. In 1966, T actical Air Com-mand established the Civil Engineering Field Activi ties Center at Eglin Auxiliary Field #2 and acti-vated the 560th RED HORSE Squadron to operate  the site. The 560th, comprised primarily ofreturning “Horsemen,” conducted 60  days of academic and field tr aining for RED HORSE replace-ment personnel. The hot, humid climate at Eglin Auxiliary Field #2 made it an ideal training site forSoutheast Asia-bound personnel. Also, the isolated site allowed the training cadre to establish a “typ-ical” Southeast Asia RED HORSE camp away from the main base. When RED HORSE requirementsAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008189in Southeast Asia began  to scale back, the training was no longer required. The Civil EngineeringField Activities Center closed in January 1970 after training over 5,000 personnel. A4.6.16.  At the p eak of activity, RED HORSE in-theater strengt h reached 2,400 military personneland 6,000-plus host nation personnel. In 1969 the workload for RED HORSE decreased, and someunits were inactivated or redeployed to other locations, leaving  two squadrons in South Vietnam bythe end of 1970. A4.6.17.  In 1966, the Air  Force was increasing its daily missi ons in support of the buildup of USground forces in Southeast Asia. The Air Force had several squadrons of aircraft ready for deploy-ment to South Vietnam. However, existing bases were loaded to the saturation point and building anadditional base posed other problems. The constr uction capability of both the Army and Navy wasalready overburdened, as was the existing civilian construction combine, RMK/BRJ. A4.6.18.  The Air Force responded with Project T urnkey, a concept for constructing a new base inminimum time. Project Turnkey was a single package wh ereby the new base  would be brought tocombat operational status in just 7 months, with the complete air base to be finished within 12 months.This was a new experience for the Air Force, because it had never had sole responsibility for the con-struction of an operational air base. A4.6.19.  The site chosen for the new air base was on the coast, near the village of Tuy Hoa. The initialoperational facility included a 9,000 foot runway  of AM-2 matting, a  taxiway, parking apron,pre-packaged tent facilities, and bladder systems for petroleum storage. This was followed by con-struction of sustained operational facilities to include  a parallel 9,500-foot concrete runway, plusmaintenance, cantonment, and operational facilities. A4.6.20.  The first shipments of construction supplies came in over the beach and were off-loaded byFilipino stevedores using landing craft. All of the contractor  camp facilities were  erected in theirplanned permanent locations for later Air Force use. A4.6.21.  A major part of the construction effort was first directed toward completion of the aluminummat runway so that operational status could be achieved at the earliest possible date. By early October,the first sections of aluminum ma tting could be placed in positi on. Mat emplacement proceeded at arate of 600-800 feet of runway per day. Simultaneously, construction was expedited on all basic facil-ities required for the interim operation of the ba se. The aluminum mat runw ay was finished by 12November 1966, a full 6 weeks ahead of the projected completion date. On that same day the new TuyHoa runway received its first aircraft, an Air Force C-130 and a C-124. These transports brought in theground control approach mobile unit and other navigational aids required for use of the runway. Threedays later, F-100s of the 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed to their new home at Tuy Hoa. A4.6.22.  The engineers then turned their attention to the construction of a concrete runway, concretetaxiway, and the base permanent  facilities. As F-100s took off from the AM-2 runway on daily mis-sions, paving operations on  the parallel runway moved forw ard at an accelerated pace (FigureA4.22.). Working both day and night, the paving crews were able to complete the concrete runway by6 April—a full month ahead of schedule. 190AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure A4.22.  Vietnamese Civilians Helping Build Tuy Hoa Parallel Runway. A4.6.23.  Simultaneously, the 820th RED HORSE Squa dron also worked around the clock to com-plete all of the sustained operationa l facilities. By June  1967, the entire air base was finished. AirForce civil engineers had proven  that when necessary they could  assume responsibility for the con-struction of an operational air base and complete it successfully. A4.6.24.  In the middle of the Vietnam effort, Prime BEEF teams and the 557th RED HORSE Squad-ron deployed to South Korea in response to the ra pid force buildup following the seizure of the USSPueblo on 23 January 1968. These units  constructed aircraft shelters, modular facilities, revetments,and other mission essential facilities to support the additional flying units in the country. A4.6.25.  During the period of rapid expansion, the civil engineering war fighting capability had tran-sitioned from virtually no capabili ty to a viable, battle-tested capability represented by its PrimeBEEF teams and RED HORSE squadrons. W e cannot fail to mention the dedicated legions of engi-neers who, during their year-long tours in Southeast Asia, operated and maintained the airbases. Theymay get little glory, but they were an essential force to help keep the aircraft flying. A4.6.26.  As American involvement in Southeast Asia began to wind down, RED HORSE capabilitieswere maintained at a high level of readiness. For the first time, the Air Force had organic heavy repairunits designed for contingency support with no contingency at hand. In  an effort to provide an engi-neer heavy repair capability as responsive and quickly deployed as the tactical aircraft they support, atraining program was developed which produced ta ngible results by completing civil engineeringprojects which developed skills similar to those which would be required during a contingency. A4.6.27.  One such projec t was the construction of  an aircraft bombing an d gunnery range at BlairLakes, Alaska. The project consisted of clearing 1,200 acres of forest, construction of personnel quar-ters, operations and maintenance buildings, and erecti on of observation towers 40 feet in height toprovide a standard range for use by Arctic construction operations. A4.7.  A Peacetime Force. In 1975, the Directorate of Engineering and Services was created at HQ USAFwhen responsibility for mortuary af fairs, housing, housing furnishings, bachelor quarters, and transientquarters transferred to the Directorate of Engineering. Other Services functions such as food service weretransferred in 1979 when the Air Force Services Office moved from the Defense Personnel Support Cen-AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008191ter, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to HQ Air Force Engineering and  Services Center (AFESC), TyndallAFB, Florida. A4.7.1.  In 1978, Services personnel began work on the Prime RIBS (readiness in base services) pro-gram to give the Services fiel d a contingency capability for f eeding, housing, and clothing deployedtroops. By using a building block concept similar to Prime BEEF, the Prime RIBS teams provided thenecessary flexibility to respond to a variety of situations. The Air Force now had the capability to sup-port troops properly in the field. A4.7.2.  Air Force civil engineers assisted local communities recovering from natural disasters. PrimeBEEF and RED HORSE teams resp onded in Northeastern Pennsylvania and Rapid City, SouthDakota, to help in the search,  rescue, and recovery operations fo llowing severe flooding. A tornadodevastated Xenia, Ohio, in 1974.  Engineers and firefighters from  Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio,assisted in the cleanup  and helped put out many  fires caused by gas leaks.  In 1979, the 823rd REDHORSE Squadron assisted in rec overy operations at Keesler AFB, Mississippi, which had beenheavily damaged by Hurricane Frederick. More recently, Air Force civil engineers helped residents inrecovery efforts following Hurricanes Andrew, Isabel, and Katrina. A4.7.3.  Protection and restoration of the envir onment became a major concern for Air Force Engi-neers in the 1970s. Responsibility for the Air Forc e environmental protection program was given tothe Directorate of Engineering and Services. Terms such as Environmental Impact Statement, Instal-lation Restoration, and pollution abatement became a part of the everyday language for Air Force civilengineers. A4.7.4.  Great improvements  in the quality of life for Air Force  personnel were made in the 1970s .High priority was given to upgrading housing, recreational facilities, child development centers, andthe workplace. A4.8.  Readiness Rebirth. Programs set in motion during the 1960s and 1970s, such as Prime BEEF, REDHORSE, quality of life improvemen ts, and environmental concerns continued to expand during the1980s. The 1980s was a period of challenges for Air Fo rce engineers as they found themselves workingon major projects overseas. A4.8.1.  Air Force engineers were responsible for th e overall program management for the construc-tion of two Israeli airbases in the Negev Desert as  part of the Camp David Accords. These projectspresented special challenges because of the for eign government construction standards and thedemanding construction schedule. A4.8.2.  Off-station Prime BEEF team training had its beginnings at  Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.That training, which developed limited beddown skills, moved to Tyndall AFB, Florida in 1972 withits parent unit, the Air Force Civil Engineering Center, the forerunner to today's Air Force Civil Engi-neer Support Agency (AFCESA). A4.8.3.  In 1979, HQ AFESC (now HQ AFCESA) relocat ed the Prime BEEF training to Field #4 atEglin AFB, Florida. The runways  at Field #4 enabled civil engineers to learn rapid runway repair(later known as airfield damage repair or ADR) as never before—on blown craters, and ADR becamethe focus. Prime BEEF team members also received some hands-on training in bomb damage repair,force beddown, Harvest Eagle equipment, chemical  warfare defense, and explosive ordnance recon-naissance. In October 1985, a major change occurred. The Prime BEEF contingency training con-ducted at Field #4 was greatly expanded to include other specialties. The new base recovery after192AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008attack (BRAAT) training combined the traditional Prime BEEF curricula with those of the dis asterpreparedness (later called Emergency Management, or EM), explosive ordnance disposal, firefight-ing, services, and commissary specialties. They learned how their individual functional areas interfacefor a coordinated base recovery effort. For 7 days, students trained and exercised together in a realisticwartime environment. A4.8.4.  Air Force Engineers were  given the opportunity to display  their capabilities during SALTYDEMO, an integrated air base survivability demonstration conducted in May  1985 at SpangdahlemAB, Germany. For 5 days, the Engineers were involved in almost every aspect of BRAAT. The dem-onstration opened a lot of eyes and focused attenti on on the importance of the air base and the engi-neers' role in air base recovery and sortie generation. A4.9.  Gulf War. Air Force Engineers played a vital  role during the Gulf War. Beginning on 7 August1990, thousands of men and women began deploying to Southwest Asia in support of Operation DESERTSHIELD/DESERT STORM—the largest movement of combat forces since World War II. US Air Forcepersonnel initially deployed to two primary locations, Dhahran and Riyadh. This soon grew to more thantwenty locations in the region, ranging from international airports, to airfields under construction, to mod-ern military air bases with state of the art facilities. Prime BEEF teams used Harvest Falcon assets to bed-down deploying forces. Created in th e 1980s, Harvest Falcon  is a complete bare ba se set that providesboth housekeeping and aircraft maintenance facilities. It combines aspects of Harvest Eagle and HarvestBare and uses soft-wall, and some hard-wall, shelters for base support and hard-wall shelters for aircraftsupport. All Harvest Falcon equipment is designed specifically for Southwest Asia operations. A4.9.1.  When billeting was unavailable at the sites, as was often the case, everyone went to work set-ting up "tent city” and no t just the engineers. Although so me Air Force personnel initially werehoused in hotels downtown, the terrorism threat forced them on  base. Soon, rows and rows of tentsblossomed on the Saudi sand.  Engineers erected approximately 5,000 tents during OperationDESERT SHIELD. Many of the bases gave their tent cities names such as "Camel-lot" and "BedrockCity." Figure A4.23.  Erecting a TEMPER Tent (Operation DESERT STORM). A4.9.2.  Electrical power was a critical element at all beddown locations, not only for aircraft supportequipment, but for computer operations and air conditioning as well. For bare base operations, the AirAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008193Force used primarily 60-kW, 100-kW, and 750-kW generators. Early in  the deployment, the smaller60-kW and 100-kW portable generators provided primary electrical power to small clusters of tents orfacilities. Such improvising required frequent servicing of the  equipment and refueling of generatorsand often led to generator overload  resulting in equipment failure. When they were later replaced orsupplemented by 750-kW diesel generators, most  Air Force power production personnel were unfa-miliar with the larger units. The problem was compounded by the unavailability of Technical Ordersfor the equipment. A4.9.3.  Generators began failing because of around-the-clock operations and a severe shortage of fil-ters and spare parts that reduc ed the amount of scheduled mainte nance that could be accomplished.The Air Force sent an eight-person civil engineer ing maintenance, inspection, repair, and training(CEMIRT) team to establish a depot repair cap ability for power production equipment at Thumrait,Oman. A4.9.4.  In August, a shortage of  primary distribution centers complicated the establishment of effi-cient power distribution systems, wh ich resulted in a lack  of safe hookups to  the primary electricaldistribution source. By 26 Sept ember 1990, however, the CEMIRT team at Kelly Air Force Base,Texas, designed an acceptable replacement using co mmercial off-the-shelf components and shippedthe thirty-four primary distribution centers to the Gulf region site s and one to Sheppard TechnicalTraining Center. A4.9.5.  Water availability, its storage, and distribution were critical elements at beddown locations.USCENTAF Engineering and Services established a minimum secure water  storage requirement of100 gallons per person for 5 days. Drinking water in itially was supplied as bottled water from localsources, and at some sites, it came from existing water distribution systems connected directly to com-mercial water sources. Nearly every site had to augment the in-place system. Other locations, such asCairo West, had to haul water by truck (Figure A4.24.) and store it in bladders. The quality of watervaried from site to site. A few  sites only needed to add a small am ount of chemicals to bring it up tostandards. Others were required to process it through Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units. Sev-enteen sites possessed water purification units. Figure A4.24.  Hauling Water to Support the Base (Operation DESERT STORM). A4.9.6.  Wastewater was collected either to underground storage tanks and pumped out by contractorsor to a gray water pond for evapor ation or absorption. However, soil conditions at some sites were a194AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008clay/sandy soil with a hard sandstone subbase  that did not permit absorption, and high humidityslowed evaporation. Engineers constructed lagoon systems to pipe the gray water furt her from thecantonment area and reduce the potential health hazard. A4.9.7.  Air Force Civil Engineers had to overcome many obstacles. Most engineers had never trainedon the set up of Harvest Falcon  equipment, and when TEMPER te nts and utility systems began toarrive, many without technical orders, the engineers were uncertain exactly what constituted a com-plete set, how they were to be assembled, or how to repair the equipment. Furthermore, the delivery ofHarvest Falcon equipment was del ayed, parts were missing, shippi ng containers inappropriatelymarked, and in some cases, equipment was appropria ted by organizations other than the consigned.War Readiness Spares Kits (WRSK) for several Harvest Falcon items often did  not accompany thedelivery or were incomplete because of funding. Inevitably, the most critical items were missing fromthe kits. Filters for genera tors were scarce, and e ngineers resorted to using T-shirts or panty hose.Spares shortages forced operators to “abuse” their equipment. Many generators, for example, operatedfor sixteen maintenance cycles without any routine maintenance. A4.9.8.  Engineers’ accomplishments the first days and weeks of the deployment were noteworthy.The following is a summary of a Prime BEEF team ’s first month’s work at King Fahd InternationalAirport, Saudi Arabia: The group accomplishments included laying over 4,000 tons of asphalt forroads, parking, Air Transportable Hospital, helicopter pads, and  chow halls. We erected over 370tents, set up 6 shower units, 10 latrines, a camp potable water and electric distribution system, a camprevetment system, designed and installed a bunker system, provided wood floors for admin/shop tents,constructed a mall complex consistin g of a chapel, BX, movie tents,  recreation center, laundry, andpersonnel facility. We have sectionalized the base for bomb damage repair purposes and set in placethe teams to conduct those operations. We set up our own logistics ope ration to acquire material andtools we could not obtain elsewhere for which we continue to rely on for 100 percent of our support. A4.9.9.  Firefighters established a  fire protection capability by asse mbling vehicles, equipment, andfirefighting agent (halon, dry chemical, and aqueous film-forming foam). They assessed the fire pro-tection requirements of the site, evaluated the host nation capabilities, and assisted engineers in plan-ning site layouts. A4.9.10.  Their vehicles arrived from prepositioned storage sites in theater, some from European WarReserves Materiel storage and one from Korea. Many of them were not operational; arriving with bro-ken pumps, dry-rotted fan belts and hoses, and few tools,  hoses, or firefighting agent. Firefightingagent was not prepositioned and did not come with  the vehicles. Empty prepositioned Flightline fireextinguishers had to be refilled on the local economy at a much higher cost. Firefighters also encoun-tered problems with the connection required to service halon tanks on vehicles, since the threads ofUS-made vehicles did not mat ch British-made equipment and required fabrication of connectors.Throughout the deployment, nearly all sites relied to some extent on host nation firefighting assistancewhose capabilities varied from site-to-site. In the early weeks, Air Force firefighters often sharedfacilities and equipment with host nation firefighters. A4.9.11.  Engineers from the 823d and 820th RED HORSE Civ il Engineering Squadrons begandeploying in late September 1990. Soon the Air Force had a strong engineering capability available intheater. They broke up into sm aller teams and spread throughout  the region performing major con-struction work at numerous sites. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008195A4.9.12.  In November, when President George Bush ordered additional forces to the Persian Gulfregion to provide an offensive capability, Air Force operations expanded at several bases with addi-tional planes and personnel. As  many sites stretched to maximum  capacity, Lieutenant GeneralCharles A. Horner, USCENTAF Commander, requested additional aircraft basing at existing sites anddispersed airpower assets by opening additional bases. For engineers this meant another push to bed-down deploying forces. This time,  however, support forces prepared the support structure for thearriving forces. Nearly every existing base added blocks of tents, erected bathhouses, and assembledaircraft hangars, general-purpose (GP) shelters, and weapons storage areas. A4.9.13.  RED HORSE engineers tackled larger and heavier jobs such as parking ramps and taxiways.At Shaikh Isa Air Base, Bahrain, the project called for constructing: two concrete hardstands, (550 by204 feet and 450 by 240 feet), groundi ng points, 100-foot wide asphalt  taxi ways around each hard-stand, and constructing a 100 by 3,200-foot asphalt taxiway running parallel to the northern side of thesouth loop. They erected 36 revetments for the inco ming aircraft. At Al Minhad Air Base, they con-structed a 390-foot by 1,050-foot concrete and asphalt parking apron for an additional F-16 squadron.At Jeddah, the Prime BEEF engi neers moved more than 150,000-cubic-yards of earth and createdmore than 400,000-square-feet of weapons storage area. The availability of a large-scale constructionindustry in the region enabled Air Force engineers to complete this type of work on time by contract-ing it out or by leasing equipment. A4.9.14.  To put more aircraft closer to the Kuwaiti border, General Horner directed his engineers toopen two new sites in Saudi Arabia . The first, about 60 miles south  of Riyadh near the town of AlKharj, had been programmed as a massive Saudi military installation, but only a runway, taxiway, andparking apron had been constructe d. This project presented one of  the biggest challenges facing AirForce engineers during the war. On 12 November 1990, RED HORSE accepted overall responsibilityfor construction, and the 4th Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) and ot her engineering personnel wouldaugment them. The 4th CES would operate and maintain the base after completion. On 25 November,RED HORSE, Prime BEEF, and contractor personnel went to wor k. The engineers compacted morethan 200,000 cubic yards of red clay to serve as the foundation for a tent city. Eventually, 630 TEM-PER tents, 4 kitchens, a gymnasi um, 21 latrines, and 26 shower a nd shave units were erected. Theyconstructed a sanitary system, and a power plan t of seventeen 750-kW generators, assembled anair-transportable hospital, and built six K-span structures. Al Kharj was ready for aircraft in early Jan-uary 1991, and by the beginning of the war, the base was home to 4,900 Air Force personnel (FigureA4.25.). 196AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure A4.25.  Al Kharj Tent City (Prince Sultan Air Base), DESERT STORM. A4.9.15.  At the same time, another RED HORSE team was busy building a forward operating loca-tion only 50 miles from the Iraqi border at King Khalid Military City, Saudi Arabia. This was initiallyplanned as a small, 800-person site with a quick turn-around capability for aircraft flying missions toIraq and Kuwait and to  recover damaged aircraft. This required the instal lation of aircraft arrestingbarriers and an expanded fire response capability. The base continued to expand until it reached a pop-ulation of 1,650 in mid-January and nearly 2,000 in February 1991. A4.9.16.  One of the outstanding engineeri ng accomplishments of the war was the construction ofover 5 miles of revetment at King  Fahd. The effort paid dividends when a missile on a parked A-10accidentally fired into a revetment wall. The earth-filled revetment stopped the missile and preventeddamage to aircraft parked nearby. A4.9.17.  Air Force civil engineers  also deployed to Turkey, Spain, the Indian Ocean, England, Ger-many, France, Italy, Greece, Portugal, and within the United S tates. Torrejon Air Base, Spain, andRhein Main Air Base, Germany, served as major  transit bases for deploying to and from SouthwestAsia. Rhein Main engineers redesigned the hydrant  system enabling them to double the refuelingcapacity by using more trucks over a shorter distance. A4.9.18.  Preparations for deployment assumed a feverish pitch throughout many areas of the world.Engineering teams reopened RAF Fairford, United Kingdom, and Moron Air Base, Spain, to supportflying operations. At Moron, they patched the runway between missions to keep it open during Oper-ation DESERT STORM. Tankers were bedded down in France, Greece, and Italy. While host nationssupplied the civil engineering suppor t, Air Force firefighters deploy ed to provide crash and rescueoperations for the aircraft. In  the United Kingdom, engineers open ed World War II-era contingencyhospitals at Nocton Hall, Bicester, and Little Rissington, where water storage capabilities had to besupplemented with bladders. A4.9.19.  In December 1990, the civil engineer fo rces in Europe began de ploying to bases in Tur-key—Operation PROVEN FORCE. At Incirlik AB, Turkey, a seventeen-member Prime BEEF teamfrom Ramstein AB, Germany, quietly worked inside a warehouse, ordering supplies and pre-assem-bling tent floors. When the T urkish government granted approval on  16 January, engineers, aircraftcrews, and other support personnel  deployed to Incirlik. The engineers constructed “Tornado Town”and helped bed down deployed personnel. A4.9.20.  When Operation DESERT STORM began, civil engineers at the sites were ready—equip-ment and materials were dispersed, personnel and structural protection was complete. FirefightersAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008197assumed 12-hour shifts to support coalition Air Forces with fire protection for integrated combat turnswith hot pit refueling operations.  As combat sorties increased, so  did the in-flight and ground emer-gencies, barrier engagements, and malfunctioning ordnance responses. Firefighters also extinguishedfires on armed aircraft with a va riety of problems caused by battle  damage. At King Khalid MilitaryCity, the firefighters responded to 157 in-flight emergencies and 785 integrated combat-turn standbysduring Operation DESERT STORM. A4.9.21.  For the United States Army Patriot batteries at Riyadh Air Base, King Khalid InternationalAirport, and near Eskan Village, RED HORSE personnel constructed security berms. They riggedfront-end loaders to assist in relo ading batteries, reducing the reload time from 45 to 5 minutes. TheAir Force also provided electricity to Patriot batteries at Riyadh and Shaikh Isa Air Bases. On 17 Jan-uary 1991, the 820th deployed to Ki ng Khalid Military City to complete the integrated combat-turnproject abandoned by the contractor. A4.9.22.  In the days before the formal cease-fire, a joint RED HORSE-Explosive Ordnance Disposalteam tackled the most challenging post-war project on 26 February, when General Horner tasked themto deny two airbases in southeastern Iraq to any future use by returning Iraqi forces. On 6 March 1991,two teams of engineers arrived  at Tallil and Jaliba Air Bases in  Iraq. At Tallil, RED HORSE usedapproximately 80,000 pounds of explosives, c onsisting primarily of 40-pound shape charges andMK-82, 500-pound bombs, to make cuts in the ru nway and taxiway every 2,000 feet. At Jaliba AirBase, the engineers denied a concrete runway and two parallel asphalt taxiways, with 27 cuts (72 cra-ters up to 40 feet  wide and 12 feet deep) in  the pavement. Only 4 days  later, on 10 March 1991, thefinal members of the team were aboard CH-47 helicopters returning to Saudi Arabia. When they werefinished, the engineers concluded that it would cost less to build a new base than to clean up and repairthe denied bases. A4.9.23.  During the Gulf War, more than 3,000 Air Force engineers bedded down 55,000 personneland 1,200 aircraft at nearly 30 sites. They erected 5,000 tents and constructed 300,000 square feet ofbuildings. They demonstrated they can provide a good living and working environment to support theprojection of air power around the world. A4.9.24.  Unlike previous wars or conflicts, civil engineers did not increase in numbers to support thewar. Consequently, many CONUS base civil engineers had to provid e essentially the same pre-warlevel of support to their home bases, but with no increase in manpower. A4.9.25.  Engineers also  assisted in humanitarian efforts. Following the war, engineers deployed toTurkey and Iraq to help feed and shelter Ku rdish refugees during Operation PROVIDE COMFORT.In 1992, both Prime BEEF and RED HORSE personnel traveled to Somalia to “Restore Hope” for thepeople there. A4.10.  Organizational Changes. The 1990s launched a period of consider able change, and opportunity,for Air Force civil engineers. In February 1991,  the Directorate of Engineering and Services wasrealigned directly under the Chief of Staff and re-designated as The Civil Engineer, an Assistant Chief ofStaff. This ended a 13-year tenur e under the Deputy Chief of S taff, Logistics and Engineering andreturned Engineering and Services to the or ganizational level of the 1950s when it was known as theAssistant Chief of Staff, Installations. A4.10.1.  Later in 1991, the 16-year union between E ngineering and Services was ended when Ser-vices merged with Morale, Welfare, and Recreation. As Services was leaving, the Explosive Ordnance198AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Disposal and Disaster Preparedness functions joined Civil Engineering, bringing essential capabilitiesto the Civil Engineer team. A4.10.2.  Civil Engineer team training evolved once again in August 1993. The BRAAT training func-tion, personnel and equipment were moved from Eglin to Tyndall AFB and placed under Air CombatCommand. At the new loca tion, designated the Silver Flag Exercise Site, program emphasis wasadjusted to give increased attention to beddown skills. This change was driven by the most probableuse of Air Force civil engineers in the era following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact threat. A4.11.  Explosive Ordnance Disposal. Prior to the Unite d Kingdom's effort to cope with unexplode dbombs during the 1940-1941 blitz on London, there is no record  of organized ordnance disposal. Inresponse to the many bombing raids to which they were subjected, the Royal Air Force formed their firstbomb disposal units. Through many su ccessful experiences, and failures, these personnel became bombdisposal experts. A4.11.1.  The United States EOD program dates back to April of 1941. The United States was not yetat war, but was actively preparing for that eventuality. Embassy personnel and military observers werereporting on the actions of warring nations and as the War Department Intelligence Section evaluatedthese reports, recommendations were made concerning actions that should be taken by the UnitedStates. One area stood out. Delayed-explosion-bombs were creating havoc in Europe, taking a heavytoll in lives and industry. It was expected that if the United States entered the war, it would experiencebombing of its cities and industries. As a result, the need for a bomb disposal program in this countryreceived immediate attention. A4.11.2.  In April 1941, the Sc hool of Civilian Defense was or ganized at the Chemical WarfareSchool, Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, and part of the training was to  be bomb disposal. It was laterdecided that the Army would train both military and civilian bomb disposal personnel, and the respon-sibility for bomb disposal was placed under the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. The location of theBomb Disposal School was changed from Edgewood Arsenal to the Ordnance Training Center, Aber-deen Proving Ground, Maryland. A4.11.3.  In the interim  the Navy, under a directive from the Chief of Naval  Operations, instituted aMine Disposal School in May of 1941. The school was located in Washington, D.C. and in Decemberof 1941 was renamed the Navy Bomb Disposal School. In 1947, the Navy was assigned Joint Serviceresponsibilities for basic bomb disposal training, making the bomb disposal career field one of the ear-liest joint service career fields established within the DOD. A4.11.4.  In 1942 the Royal Air Force started training United States Army Eighth Air Force personnelin bomb disposal procedures. At the same time, ordnance personnel were also being trained in bombdisposal techniques in the United States at the Army Bomb Disposal School, Aberdeen ProvingGrounds, Maryland. These personnel supported combat  operations in the Middle East, Sicily , andItaly from April 1943 through March 1944. Their duties included clearing unexploded bombs fromAir Corps installations, clearing enemy ammunition dumps, and safing or disposing of booby traps. AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure A4.26.  EOD Mine Hunt. 199A4.11.5.  In the Pacific Isla nd-hopping campaigns, bomb clearance challenges were numerous andenormous. Many times bomb disposal was being accomplished simultaneously with airfield recoveryand construction. Bomb disposal personnel moved forward with advancing units using their talents toreduce the risk from both American and Japanese ordnance. The end of World War II signaled a slow-down for Army Air Force bomb disposal efforts. With the reduction of military forces during the 1946to 1950 time frame, the bomb disposal or ganization was cut way back and its personnel scatteredthroughout the military. A4.11.6.  At the beginning of the Korean conflict, the function was revitalized, and the name Explo-sive Ordnance Disposal, or EOD, was adopted instead of “bomb disposal” to ensure that al l newmunitions developments were covered. A4.11.7.  On 21 May 1951, the Air Force picked up EOD responsibilities and assigned explosive ord-nance disposal operational duties within the Zone of Interior to Headquarters Air Materiel Command(HQ AMC). Accordingly, AMC activated its first explosive ordnance disposal squadron, on 16 June1952, when the 1st Ordnance Squadr on, Aviation, was re-designated as the 1st Explosive OrdnanceDisposal Squadron. The squadron wa s located at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, with an authorizedstrength of 11 officers and 65 enlisted. A4.11.8.  Combat operations in Vietnam were unique in nature because EOD personnel not only hadto eliminate explosive hazards from conventional weapons systems, they also had to contend with theingenious ability of the Viet Cong to acquire  dud US bombs and projectiles and emplace them asmines or booby traps. A4.11.9.  EOD’s mission and responsibilities have continued to change and grow from its beginningsin World War II to Operation DESERT STORM and the present (Figure A4.27.). EOD involvementin joint and allied operations such as Joint Casualty Resolution Center missions in recovering missingin action (MIA) airmen in Vietnam and Laos; insertion behind enemy lines to destroy classified com-ponents of downed United States aircraft; base denial of enemy in stallations; support of intelligencegathering agencies; protection of  the President of the United States and foreign dignitaries; andcleanup of ordnance storage depot  catastrophes in foreign countries,  highlight the diversity of EODactivities used by all levels of the United States government. 200AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008Figure A4.27.  EOD Preparing to Destroy Unexploded Ordnance. A4.11.10.  The Air Force EOD missi on is to protect personnel, resources, and the environment fromthe effects of hazardous ordnance. Air Force EOD  must sustain the capability to disarm unexplodedordnance delivered or placed by enemy forces, and render safe United States ordnance made danger-ous by accident or other circumstances. In addition, they are obligated to use their special expertise toassist federal and civil au thorities when called upon in times such as dea ling with terrorist or othercriminal acts, accidents, and found explosive items. A4.11.11.  EOD in the United States is a joint service program. Each branch of the service has specificresponsibilities assigned to it by DOD. Some of  these responsibilities are unique to one service andsome overlap between two or more services. In 1971, the Navy was designated as the single managerfor all common EOD training and t echnology. Today, training continues to be provided by theinter-service staff at the Explosive Ordnance Schools located at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. A4.11.12.  The Air Force EOD program has been managed by several disciplines, including Logisticsand Operations, throughout its history, but has now found a home within the Civil Engineer commu-nity. There is precedent for this arrangement as well, as it is common with other US and foreign mili-tary services. A4.11.13.  EOD personnel have bu ilt their tradition, through achievements gained in minimizingpotential explosive accidents throughout the years. They  are truly a valuable  addition to the UnitedStates Air Force Civil Engineer community. A4.12.  Disaster Preparedness. The Air Force Disaster Preparedness Program was established in 1965 asan outgrowth of the Disaster Control program of the 1950s, which had nuclear attack as its primary focus.The nuclear weapons accidents at Palmares, Spain and Thule Air Base, Greenland and Hurricane Camillewhich devastated the Mississippi coast, gave rise to a consolidation of several emergency, peacetime andwartime related activities into one co mprehensive program. An officer career field was established andaugmented with existing enlisted resources to create the Air Force Disaster Preparedness Program. A4.12.1.  As the US involvement in  Southeast Asia grew in the late  1960s, Air Force Disaster Pre-paredness added to its list of re sponsibilities the need for planning, training for, and conducting con-AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008201ventional attack protective measures. As the Vietnam conflict came to a close, Disaster Preparednessmoved its focus to the growing Soviet and Warsaw Pack threat against NATO. Limited capabilities forprotection against the growing threat of chemical/biological attacks led to an accelerated program inthe mid-1970s to equip and train USAF personnel against the chemical/biological threat. The DisasterPreparedness career field grew in numbers to meet these added responsibilities. A4.12.2.  As attention was focused on Airbase Survivability and Operability in the mid-1980s, Disas-ter Preparedness programs again  expanded to address the many de ficiencies identified during theSALTY DEMO air base op erability capability demonstration held at Spangdahlem Air Base, Ger-many. Once again, as attention shifted to potential adversaries in Southwest Asia, Air Force DisasterPreparedness programs emphasized the importance of training, protective clothing, and equipment forthe eventuality of chemical/biological and conventional attacks. In Operation DESERT STORM,Disaster Preparedness personnel mobilized and deployed to numerous bases and sites throughoutSouthwest Asia to ensure that all Air Force personnel were ready to survive and operate. A4.12.3.  Throughout these shifts in threat and as new responsibilities were added, Disaster Prepared-ness personnel continued to maintain a readiness posture and responded to numerous natural disasters,nuclear/conventional weapons accidents, incidents, hazardous materials incidents, and aircraft acci-dents. The Air Force Disaster Preparedness program in the past has ensured that commanders have thecapability to prepare for and respond to all peacetime and wartime threats and hazards. In 2000, a FullSpectrum Threat Response (FSTR) office was established at AF CESA to lead all Air Force-relatedefforts, support joint service interests, and provide support to civil  authorities. The FSTR program isdesigned primarily to support response activities on in stallations in the United States and overseas.The program was renamed as Emergency Management in 2006. As the Air  Force prepares for thechallenges of the future, CE Readiness and EM programs will continue to provide professional emer-gency management and airbase operability support to plan, train, equip, and respond to all peacetimeand wartime threats. A4.13.  Challenges in Post Cold War Europe. A4.13.1.  The Balkans and Operation ALLIED FO RCE (OAF). The breakup of Yugoslavia broughtsuppressed ethnic tensions to the surface in the 1990s. Engineers supported US deployments to theregion during Operations DENY FLIGHT, DELIBERATE FORCE and JOINT ENDEAVOR. As asign that the Cold War had truly ended, engineers bedded down forces at  Tuszla AB, Bosnia-Herze-govina and Taszar AB, Hungary. Engineers’ work in the Balkans continued throughout the nineties asthe region reached a boiling point in 1999. Although tensions had been present in the region for cen-turies, the immediate cause of the conflict in Kosovo was Slobodan Milosevic, and his oppression ofthe ethnic Albanians there for the preceding decade. Oppression ultimately gave rise to violent oppo-sition to Serb rule in the formation of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and then to the spiral of violencethat ensued in 1998 and  1999. Civil unrest and Serbian use of force in Koso vo caught internationalattention and when negotiations broke down and Serbian troops swept in causing massive civilian dis-ruption and an impending refuge e crisis, NATO responded with Operation ALLIED FORCE on 24March 1999. The American and NATO objectives in Kosovo were to stop  the killing and achieve adurable peace that prevents furt her repression and provides for demo cratic self-government for theKosovar people. A4.13.2.  Engineers directly s upported the beddown of aircraft  and personnel at bases throughoutEurope. They worked to pr epare RAF Fairford and Moron AB to ho st deploying forces but Aviano202AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008AB, Italy, was the operation’s main hub of activity. Already hosting added forces for Balkan opera-tions, the base was soon pac ked with deploying forces. In February 1999, civil engineers from the86th Civil Engineer Group at Ramstein Air Base  Germany and 52nd Civil  Engineer Squadron fromSpangdahlem Air Base Germany be gan assisting the stressed 31st  Civil Engineer Squadron at thebulging Italian base. They constructed a tent city designed to house up to 4,000 troops, resurfaced sixF-16 parking pads and provided high-voltage power feeds for a new substation. In addition, civil engi-neers, as part of site survey teams, traveled to countries such as Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungaryto identify potential beddown sites for the “Papa Bear” buildup. USAFE’s Construction and TrainingSquadron engineers deployed to several bases to wo rk projects. At Gioia del Colle AB, Italy , theyworked with Spangdahlem’s Prime BEEF troops to construct five parking ramps to reduce the explo-sive risk from parked A-10s. At Istres AB, France, the CTS team completed a ramp extension in con-crete and asphalt. A4.13.3.  Beginning in April, civil engineers moved to Rinas Airport at Tirana, Albania, to begin AirForce beddown for Joint Task Force Shining Hope, established to provide immediate humanitarianrelief to more than 450,000 ethnic Albanian refugees fleeing the Province of Kosovo into Albania andthe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Both Prime BEEF and RED HORSE e ngineersdeployed to Albania to support not only the humanitarian mission but also the massive air movementof the Army’s Task Force Hawk. The 823d RED HORSE engineers were tasked with deployment of aR-1 team to support USAFE operations on 11 April. By 13 April the team had arrived in Ramstein andwas deploying teams forward to Tirana by the next day. Figure A4.28.  RED Horse Heavy Equipment Shipping to Tirana, Albania. A4.13.4.  Battling the mud at Tirana, 823d RED HORSE engineers replaced a failing C-17 operationsramp by constructing a new 975’ x 150’ x 18” concrete parking and marshalling area; building a new987’ concrete taxiway to replace the taxiway destroyed by SHINING HOPE operations; improving3.5 miles of camp and pe rimeter supply roads; constructing a medical evacuation helicopter opera-tions pad; completing an upgrade of the power grid for the USAF tent city and installing 100 environ-AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008203mental control units; constructing a German fuel pad and a US Forces fuel pad; and installing 600’ ofaccess roads. A4.13.5.  Near the end of the conflict, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen ordered the 820th REDHORSE Squadron to deploy a RH-1 team and two RH-2 teams to  Tirana, Albania, to perform roadand bridge repairs and to complete projects begun by the 823rd RED HORSE Squadron at Rinas Air-port. For the humanitarian work in Albania, the Joint Staff decided to use the Air Force Contract Aug-mentation Program (AFCAP). The major project was to construct three tent cities in Albania to houseup to 20,000 refugees in each complex. AFCAP co mpleted Camp Hope and was well under way onCamp Eagle when hostilities ceased on 10 June. A4.13.6.  The remainder of the 823d  R-1 team in Ramstein continued to support USAFE operationsthrough contingency project evaluations, designs, and deployment/reception operations for two addi-tional 823d R-2 teams that would deploy forward to various other countries. In Hungary, a 94-personRH-2 team from the 823rd RED HORSE Squadron deployed to Taszar AB to perform airfield repairs.823d RED HORSE engineers also completed construction and beddown projects in Trapani, Sicilyand Aviano, Italy supporting Operation ALLIED FORCE. In Turkey, 823rd RED HORSE and PrimeBEEF engineers constructed a tent city at Balikesir AB in preparation for a beddown of F-15 aircraft.However, the war ended on June 10th, before the full force could move to the base. Following the war,Joint Air Force, Army, and Navy EOD teams were sent to Kosovo to locate and dispose of unexplodedordnance in the American sector. Figure A4.29.  RED HORSE Taxiway Repair Work, Taszar Hungary. A4.13.7.  Overall, engineers suppo rted Air Force personnel as they  deployed to 21 expeditiona rybases and generated 38,000 sorties without a single combat casualty. A4.14.  A New Millennium. The events of 11 September 2001 brought a new emphasis on the expedition-ary nature of the US Air Force and its ability to  project power anywhere around the world. Engineers atbases throughout the Air Force suddenly began putting their bases on  a wartime footing by constructingand installing antiterrorist/force protection measures and by preparing base populations to respond to ter-rorist acts. Within a matter of weeks, active duty, Guard and Reserve civil engineers found themselvesbedding down forces in places such  as Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Afghanistan in support ofthe Global War on Terrorism. Eventually, more than 2,700 engineers deployed to 13 main bases, mostly in204AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008the Central Command area of responsibility, to support Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF), theAmerican effort to eliminate the terrorist breeding ground in Afghanistan. These bases ranged from aus-tere sites to well-developed airbases. At one location, operators lived in a hangar without toilets for abouta month before engineers arrived with Harvest Falcon assets to build a tent city. A4.14.1.  RED HORSE, firefighte rs, EOD, and Readiness/Emergency Management personnel wereall heavily tasked. At Thumrait AB, Oman, engineers from 20 bases constructed more than 240 TEM-PER tents, 13 California shelters, 6 latrines, 4 shower/shave facilities, 27 expandable shelter contain-ers, and 2 power plants in the first 90 days as the mission grew from a tanker to a tanker/bomber base.Firefighters established two fire stations and placed  in service nine special purpose emer gencyresponse vehicles with associated equipment. In  the first 90 days firefighters responded to 49 emer-gencies at the base. In late September, members of the 2nd CES at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, arrivedat Masirah Island with a 55-person Prime BEEF lead team. Two 25-person teams arrived from DyessAFB, Texas and Whiteman AFB, Missouri. By mid- October the team had erec ted three tent cities:Tent City-1 was an 1,800- person city erected in 7-10 days ; Tent City-2 was a 2,200-person cityerected and completely functional in 60 hours;  Tent City-3 was a 1,400-person city completed bymid-October. A4.14.2.  As coalition forces captu red bases in Afghanistan, engineer s were put to the test as theyworked to prepare them to receiv e aircraft and personnel. The country ’s infrastructure was in sham-bles from years of conflict and neglect. The pounding given the bases by coalition aircraft during OEFfurther damaged airfields and surrounding structures. At Mazar-e-Sharif airfield, RED HORSE engi-neers found a bombed-out runway and no supplies to repair it. The engineers turned to local contrac-tors using 100-year old practices to fill th e craters. This included p ounding small rocks with handtools and pouring boiled tar over the rocks until the craters were filled. Eventually, they were able toreceive a deployable pavement repair system to make more pe rmanent repairs enabling C-17s to usethe base. A4.14.3.  The 86th Contingency Response Group from Ramstein AB, Germany, became the first AirForce team to deploy to Manas Airport, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan in December 2001. Prime BEEF, REDHORSE, and 49th Materiel Maintenance Squadron pe rsonnel helped construct a tent city for 2,200troops using four 550-person Force Provider sets in 30  days in the dead of winter. They experiencedsub-zero temperatures frequently during the first four weeks of their deployment, with freezing pipes,boilers, and diesel fuel that gelled. RED HORSE built a fuel storage area for six 50,000-gallon blad-ders in five days. Truly a coalition base, eight different countries had troops on site, including France,Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Spain. A4.14.4.  As combat operations in Afghanistan wound down, Air Force civil engineers kept busy pre-paring bases in the CENTCOM AOR for sustained operations in Afghanistan and to set the stage forOperation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF). Building faciliti es at bases throughout  the region aided in thepreparation for combat. Bedding do wn personnel and weapons in several countries enabled the AirForce to provide superb support  to the US drive to Baghdad and  destruction of the Saddam Husseinregime. A4.14.5.  Although combat operations began on 20 Ma rch 2003, civil engineers had been activethroughout the region for months.  Some bases had been used fo r several years under OperationSOUTHERN WATCH, the patrolling of the no-fly zone over southern Iraq, but additional forces wereheaded for the region. Engineers began opening  bases in Jordan and Sa udi Arabia and expandingAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008205bases such as Camp Snoopy at Doha International Airport and Al Udeid AB, Qatar, and Ali Al SalemAB, Kuwait. A4.14.6.  On 6 Ja nuary 2003, a 13-person team from the 16th Civ il Engineer Squadron at HurlburtField deployed to Al Udeid to build a combined air operations center for the Joint Special OperationsAir Component. They converted a Frame Supported Tensioned Fabric Shelter warehouse into a facil-ity with 6,000 square feet of of fice space, intelligence areas, a se nsitive compartmented informationfacility, a communications area, and a 5,000-square foot auditorium with live feed projection screensto track all operations in theater in just 17 days. A4.14.7.  Members of the 60 CES,  Travis AFB, California, deployed to Shaikh Isa AB, Bahrain, inNovember 2002, just in time for the OIF buildup. Shaikh Isa became home to Air Force and Marinesflying KC-135s and KC-130. As the camp grew from 800 to 2300 personnel, the engineers began con-struction on a 1600-person hard wall  Expeditionary Village. The number of aircraft also grew to 53aircraft requiring the engineers to construct a 385,000 square foot expeditionary ramp and later a $20million ramp, in addition to an Air Force/Marine Joint Operations Center. Engineers at Shaikh Isa ABdeveloped an expeditionary hydrant loop refueling system using 3,100 feet of six-inch diameter hoseline to provide direct refu eling capability to four aircraft parking spots. Constructed in less than 10days, it provided 1,200 gallons per minute and up to 600 gallons per minute to any one refueling point.The system accounted for more than 20 percent of all fuel issued during OIF. A4.14.8.  US planners ha d envisioned opening a nort hern front into Iraq from bases in Turkey. AirForce engineers began work at the first of three bases in Turkey in mid-February as an initial 10-per-son contingent from the 16th CES at Hurlburt Fiel d deployed to Diyarbakir AB, T urkey, to beginbuildup of a tent city fo r an estimated 7,000 troops. Diyarbakir  was slated to be the main northernoperating base in support of operations against Iraq, if the Turkish government granted permission forthe US to stage operations from its  soil. However, the Turkish Parliament’s approval to permit thedeployment of up to 64,000 American  troops to Turkish bases failed to garner enough votes. Whilethe negotiations continued, the remainder of the 55-person EA team from Hurlburt arrived at Diyarba-kir on 20 March. Although the populati on at Diyarbakir peaked at  approximately 800 personnel, thebig influx of troops and equipment never occurred and the Hurlburt team dismantled the contingencyfacilities and equipment and redeployed on 20 April. A4.14.9.  Engineers were called upon to support Special Operations Forces (SOF) at several locations.At one base in Saudi Arabia, members of the 375th CES from Scott AFB bedded down more than4,000 SOF troops while operating under a 45-day communications blackout. They erected 420 struc-tures—tents, Alaska shelters, GP  tents, Bedouin tents, AFCAP-procured tents, Sprung shelters, anddome shelters. When additional engineers arrived from Moody and Be ale AFBs, they created 1 mil-lion gallons of fuel capability with two hot refueling pits, set up a seven-megawatt power plant and awater distribution system with a water downloading point outside the gate, and used 9,000 square feetof AM-2 mat to build parking pads for diverted fighters. The engineers dismantled the facilities duringMay and redeployed forward to Baghdad International Airport in May. A4.14.10.  The 86th Contingency Response Group from Ramstein AB, Germany, deployed to BashurAirfield, 255 miles north of Baghdad in northern Iraq. Among them were firefighters and bioenviron-mental engineers. The 7,000-foot runway was being used for C-17  and C-130 airlift missions, drop-ping off approximately 1 million pounds of cargo a day to resupply coalition forces. The airfield, onceused to fly in oil field equipment, had become a bustling airlift hub supporting US Army forces. 206AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008A4.14.11.  The first civil engineer  squadron assigned to Iraq arri ved at Tallil on 27 March. 407thExpeditionary CES (ECES) personnel worked with British engineers to bed down and support A-10missions. They repaired two concrete runways, installed an airfield lighting system, and constructedthree fuel farms and more than 160  billeting tents, an electrical power plant and distribution system,shower and latrine facilities and a dining facility. A 55-person EA team from the 114 CES, SouthDakota ANG, later joined them. The Guard team, together with a Reserve EP team from Beale built atent city for 2,200 (2 housekeeping  sets) and operations and maintenan ce facilities for the A-10 andC-130 missions at Tallil. Additional assets arrived from Cairo West on 28 April after that base closed.Tallil was a coalition base, with troops from Great  Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, Estonia, Lithuania,and Korea. A4.14.12.  American forces entered and began securing Saddam International Airport, which theyrenamed Baghdad International Airport (BIAP), on 5 April. CENTAF/C7 tapped Maj Richard Reid togo to BIAP as the temporary BC E until another team could arrive.  Major Reid was OIC of the 1 14CES, South Dakota ANG Prime BEEF  team. While at Baghdad, Major  Reid and a handful of engi-neers began to lay out Air Force tent city but had no assets, vehicles, or equipment for several days. Figure A4.30.  Engineers Repairing Runway in Southwest Asia. A4.14.13.  On 17 April, an ADVON team headed by Lt Col Tracey Walker, including six firefightersand six EOD troops, traveled from Bashur AB to Kirkuk AB, Iraq, via Army convoy. The airfield wasopened for operations just two days later. A4.14.14.  Air Force civil engineer ing tested a new capability duri ng OIF with the fielding of Air-borne RED HORSE (ARH) teams.  ARH teams take 21 traditional RED HORSE members and aug-ment them with six fire fighters, six explosive ordnance disposal technicians, and two chemical andbiological readiness experts. Developed under Chief of Staff General John P. Jumper’s direction, thespecially trained and equipped teams could deploy into austere locations to assess airfield capabilities,prepare helicopter or aircraft  landing areas, clear obstacles, instal l emergency airfield lighting, andmake expedient airfield damage repairs. They could also perform expedient force protection construc-tion and clear explosive hazards. The teams could eith er parachute into these areas or be inserted by“fast roping” from helicopters. Their equipment could be sling-loaded and carried by helicopter. TheAirborne RED HORSE units faced their first operational tests during the war in Iraq. Three teams sup-ported forward basing of Joint forces at seized Iraqi airbases. At Tallil, they helped recover the airfieldAFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008207in preparation for use by forward deployed air assets, cleared over 475 acres of airfield surface, swepta 15-acre joint service beddown area, recovere d 13,000 small arms rounds, destroyed over 600 GulfWar-era munitions, exploited 30 “f irst seen” munitions items, an d established a 20-acre explosivestorage area. At BIAP, they evaluated one million square yards of airfield pavements, conducted EODsweeps of mission critical areas, prepared four craters for permanent repair, installed and operated anEmergency Airfield Lighting System (EALS), and battl ed a large structural fire at the 4th InfantryDivision’s headquarters. A4.14.15.  RED HORSE units were active at nearly every base in the theater. At Al Udeid AB, mem-bers of the 823rd constructed a 17-acre parking ramp, valued at $9.1 million. Larger than 17 footballfields, the ramp doubled the parki ng spaces for KC-135 and KC-10 airc raft and was finished in lessthan six months. While at Thumrait AB, Oman, RED HORSE engineers constructed a 47-acre parkingramp with blast deflectors, as phalt taxiways, hammerhead, and area/edge lighting. The Air Forceengineers were able to complete  the project in just six months, one -third the contractor estimate.Members of the 307 RHS also constructed a 200’ x 200’ concrete munitions holding pad and an 8000’x 24’ asphalt road. A4.14.16.  A handful of EOD specialists were involved in an interesting project in Iraq. On 29 March,four Air Force EOD specialists from the 321st ECES and the  384th ECES and 10 Navy EOD troopsformed a 14-man team to execute Operation RESTORE IRAQI OIL under direction of the 1st MarineExpeditionary Force. Over a period of 30 days they cleared paths to 700 oil wellheads in the Rumay-lah, Az Zubayr, and Safwan oilfields in Iraq and cl eared 14 gas-oil separation plants of unexplodedordnance and improvised explosive devices. In the course of their work they also uncovered numerousbunkers with weapons caches and de stroyed more than 5,000 pieces of ordnance  to help secure thevaluable oilfields for the Iraqi people. A4.14.17.  Overall, more than 4,500 engineers were deployed in support of the initial OIF operations.They established 12 new bases in the region and expanded the mission on all 10 existing bases on theArabian Peninsula. They set up  42 housekeeping sets or commercial housekeeping equivalents andsupported more than 64,000 Air For ce personnel, in addition to vari ous Army, Special Operations,Marine, and coalition forces. They executed more than $329 million in construction through 211 newcontracts. Engineers placed 820,000 square yards of concrete and asphalt, enough to build a four-lanehighway from Orlando to Miami. They constructed 3.2 million square feet of contingency facilities orthe equivalent of building a Mall of America in  less than one year. Air Force engineers put up 3,200bare base tents, installed 190 miles of expedient water piping, and built 200 million gallon petroleum,oils and lubricants (POL) storage and distribution systems. A4.14.18.  Since 2003, civil engineers have continued to support the American presence in the region.In 2004, they began to take on a new mission—direct support of the U.S. Army Combat Support Ser-vice throughout Iraq and Kuwait. Known as “in lieu of” missions, engineers through the 732nd ECESsquadron at Balad AB Iraq were embedded into Ar my units providing engineering, design and fire-fighting support to Army units who were short of trained engineers. This also meant expanded train-ing for engineers supporting the  Army. This entailed intensive training on convoy operations inKuwait, including a five-day live-fire exercise. The support to  the Army expanded later to includeRED HORSE squadrons. A4.14.19.  EOD forces have been heavily tasked to perform their missions in Iraq and Afghanistan inlight of the expanded use of improvised explosive devices by insurgent forces. Air Force EOD opera-tions “outside the secured perimete r” were essential to air base  force protection and the freedom of208AFPAM10-219V1   9 JUNE 2008operation of land-maneuver forces. Serving on weapons intelligence teams in Iraq and provisionalreconstruction teams in Afghanistan, EOD technicians provided agile combat support to the combat-ant commander. A4.15.  Future Challenges. This brief history of Air Fo rce Civil Engineers introduces a series of pam-phlets to help today’s Engineers prepare for future peacetime emergencies and wartime support whenonce again they are called upon to demonstrate their “Can Do—Will Do’ spirit. To the extent possible, thevolumes in this series update the lessons of the past and provide current guidance. Some of those lessonsare timeless. Methods and procedures  relating to newer systems, for wh ich there are no  historic prece-dents, await the innovative ideas  the unit develops and then passes al ong to those who will follow . Thegains of the past must not slip away, nor should anyone be satisfied with the status quo. The developmentof new initiatives to further strengthen the ca pabilities of all engineers poses a continuing and excitingchallenge to every member of the force. A4.16.  Additional Information.
