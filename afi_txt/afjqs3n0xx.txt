RELEASABILITY: There are no release restrictions on this publication. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ SECTION A:  GENERAL 1. This AFJQS standardizes on-the-job training (OJT) tasks and constitutes an approved trainingprogram for the Air Force Public Affairs Agency (AFPAA) Combat Camera Squadrons.   Unit training  managers,  supervisors,  trainers,  and  trainees  will  use  this  AFJQS  and  other  training functions to  plan, conduct, and document on the job training (OJT).  This AFJQS identifies the minimum training required to become a qualified CTCS member in accordance with AFI 35-111 4.3.    This  AFJQS  will  be  available  in  Training  Business  Area  (TBA)  and  must  be  used  to develop  the  Master  Training  Plan  (MTP)  and  the  Individual  Training  Plans  (ITP)  for  CTCS. Specific  applicability  of  this  AFJQS to  Air  National  Guard  and  Air  Force  Reserve  Command personnel  is  addressed  in  AFI  20-112.    This  AFJQS  will  remain  in  effect  until  superseded  or rescinded. 2. Maintain this AFJQS according to AFI 36-2201 and AFMAN 33-363.  Urgent changes aredisseminated  via  message. Submit recommended AFJQS improvements or  corrections  to  Air Force Public Affairs Agency Training Division (AFPAA / AOT Bldg. 171, 2261 Hughes Ave, Ste 157, Lackland AFB TX 78236-9853). 3. Review AF e-Publishing, the official source site for Air Force administrative publications andforms  (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/)  to  identify  available  training  materials.  Use  this AFJQS  in  conjunction  with  the  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  and locally  assigned  tasks  to  identify  work  center  duty  position training.    Also,  use  this  AFJQS along  with  the  CFETP  to  evaluate  newly  assigned  personnel  and  identify  individual  training requirements. 4. Tasks listed on the AFJQS were selected according to the Instructional System Development(ISD)  process  and  are  the  minimum,  mandatory  CTCS  training  requirements.    Tasks  may not  be  common  to  all  equipment  or  functions;  however,  the  task  must  be  trained  if  it  is assigned  to  the  individual’s  duty  position.    Trainees  must  demonstrate  the  ability  to  perform assigned tasks according to the established proficiency codes before completing training. 1 SECTION B: TASK QUALIFICATION 1. Personnel  will  be  qualified  to  the  GO/NO  GO  standard  on  this  AFJQS.  GO  means  theindividual can perform/identify the task according to the established proficiency code assigned to that  task  utilizing  appropriate  instructions,  training  references,  or  other  procedural  guidance identified in the AFJQS.  SECTION C: TRAINING DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINER/CERTIFIER IDENTIFICATION. 1. Document  training  required  on  this  AFJQS  in  accordance  with  AFI  36-2201,  Air  ForceTraining  Program  and  the  TBA  procedural  guide  available  in  the  TBA  application.    If  this product  is  used  separately  from  TBA  use  the  identification  blocks  below  to  list  all  personnel authorized  to  sign  off  tasks  according  to  AFI  36-2201,  para  6.9.6.    For  civilians,  document civilian training on AF Form 971.  All trainers and certifiers authorized to sign off tasks in Part II of this AFJQS will be identified in TBA. Per AFI 36-2201, paragraph 6.9.8.1, critical tasks in this  particular  AFJQS  are  defined  as  those  tasks  considered  core  requirements.    If  a  military trainee is assigned duties or a task not included in an individual’s CFETP or this AFJQS, the supervisor will add these tasks to the MTP and ITP.  2. This  AFJQS  has  been  coordinated  with  applicable  CFMs.  Overall  POC  for  this  AFJQS  isSAF/PAR, DSN 614-4462. BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE OFFICIAL KATHLEEN A.
