These Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) were developed to enhance on-the-job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. As a trainer, the QTPs provide you with the breakdown of tasks into teachable elements. The teachable elements will help you to guide the trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task performance without assistance. QTPs are also used by the task certifiers/certification official to evaluate trainees concerning tasks which need third-party certification.  2.  Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for the trainee’s job position. Core task items are identified with the number “5” on the STS Column 2; these items are the minimum mandatory skills which are required for all 4N0X1 personnel to be proficient in performing. You have the flexibility to arrange training for each module in the order that you decide.  3.  Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee to review the training references to gain a better understanding of the objective for each module. If the trainee has any questions about the objective, clarify the behavior that is expected in the objective. Review the performance checklist with the trainee, and allow him/her sufficient time to learn each step (some objectives may take longer to teach). Remember--the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and to allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task without assistance.  4.  When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate each task objective. When the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document task completion appropriately in AFTR.  5.  The QTP task completion is to be annotated on AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, filed in Part 3, Section B in AFTR. NOTE: The individual checklists are not filed in each member’s AFTR. A master checklist is filed in Part 3, Section B of the hardcopy Master Training Plan (MTP) folder.  6. concerning each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in AFTR. As the trainer, when you are satisfied that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met.  7. trainer first must ensure that the trainee is qualified to perform the task without assistance. Then the trainee will be evaluated by a task certifier/certifying official. The tasks which require third-party certification are denoted with a “^” in Column 3E of the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). After third-party certification, training qualification is documented appropriately in AFTR.  8.  The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing refresher/sustainment training. Such standardization will benefit the CFETP training concept throughout each member’s career. These documents also will be utilized for assessing/certifying the Aerospace Medical Service Specialist each time that he/she is assigned to a new duty position. The QTP developers’ goal is to publish a usable document for certifying officials, trainers, and trainees for the purpose of enhancing on-the-job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. We value your first-hand expertise, and we encourage your feedback. Direct all inquiries to:  If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which need remediation. Conduct a feedback If the task which is being trained requires third-party certification by a task certifier/certifying official, the 383d TRAINING SQUADRON/TRR c/o 4N0X1 CDC WRITER/MANAGER 2931 Harney Rd, BLDG 903  Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 DSN: 420-5126     3  Volume 3                                Module 1 FIELD TRIAGE  SUBJECT AREA: Field Medicine.

Performed hand hygiene and donned gloves 2.    Verified correct patient using two identifiers  3.    Removed jewelry, including rings, from the extremity   4.    Assessed the extremity for the 8 P’s: pain, pallor, pulses, paresthesia,                  paralysis, puffiness, position and pressure    5.    Obtained or facilitated radiographic studies as indicated. Expressed awareness that common indications include suspected fractures/dislocations, severe soft tissue injuries, and suspected foreign bodies. Notified the practitioner   immediately of any abnormalities in neurovascular status before splint  application  6.    If skin integrity was disrupted in the presence of a fracture, considered it to be an open fracture; notified the practitioner immediately 7.    Inspected all wounds and covered them with a sterile dressing. Cleaned and         cultured wounds as directed by the practitioner 8.    Collaborated with the practitioner in choosing the most suitable type of splint  9.    Placed the patient in a position of comfort that was appropriate for the splint            chosen   10.  Prepared water for splint material:            a.  Fiberglass splints: Used only a small amount of water.                      b.  Plaster splints:       Prepared a bucket of tepid water, 21°C to 29°C                                                      (70°F to 84°F) Note: Used cool or warm water, not hot water, to wet the plaster or fiberglass  11.   Measured the uninjured extremity  12.   Cut prepared splints, rolls, or loose sheets to the measured length.     Determined the width by the largest surface to be supported  13.   When using loose sheets or plain plaster, padded the entire area to be splinted with one to four layers of cast padding. Used extra padding for marked edema, friable skin, or bony prominences. Wrapped the padding around the extremity circumferentially from the distal to the proximal end of the extremity, seeking conformity and uniform pressure. Alternatively, folded the padding and placed it directly under the splint. Avoided making the splint too loose or too tight. Protected bony prominences by using the appropriate size of splint and shaping it carefully in addition to using extra padding. Used caution with patients at high risk for skin breakdown 14.   When incorporating digits in splints, placed a single layer of padding           between the digits                       11   15.   Activated the splint:           a.  Fiberglass splint rolls: Used a minimum amount of water (i.e., a single   line of water down the middle of splints 3 inches or less wide, and a zigzag line of water down wider splints).  Rolled up the moistened splint inside a            towel and pressed it to remove excess moisture (did not squeeze);           repeated this on the dry side of the towel.            b.  Plaster splints:  Immersed and maintained plaster splints in the soaking            bucket until the bubbling stopped; took the material from the bucket and    gently squeezed it to remove excess moisture, then smoothed the material together to meld the layers. Maintained the desired position of the extremity from the time the first layer of padding or splinting material was applied         16.   Applied the now-activated and smoothed splinting material.  Used the palmar surface of the hand and an elastic bandage to form and shape the material into a splint. Applied the elastic bandage circumferentially, wrapping the bandage from the distal to the proximal end of the extremity, seeking uniform pressure and conformity         17.   Reassessed distal motor and neurovascular status; notified the practitioner            immediately of any abnormalities  18.   Elevated the extremity on a smooth surface, and allowed 15 minutes of drying time before discharge. Did not place the splint on a plastic surface for drying  19.   Continued to reassess distal motor and neurovascular status (i.e., of the  hand or foot) after splint application; notified the practitioner immediately of any           abnormalities   20.   If the splint was for a lower extremity, taught the patient how to walk with           crutches or another ambulatory assistive device 21.   If a sling was appropriate, applied it after the splint had been cured to firmness 22.   Applied cold packs wrapped in a dry towel or cloth as indicated and/or           prescribed for no longer than 20 minutes at a time  23.   Assessed, treated, and reassessed pain according to institution standard  24.   Administered tetanus immunization as indicated and prescribed 25.   Administered antibiotics as indicated and prescribed  26.   Discarded supplies, removed gloves and performed hand hygiene  27.
