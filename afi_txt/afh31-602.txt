Introduction1.1.1. Executive Order 12829 establishes the National Industrial Security Program (NISP).  DoD5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-R,Industrial Security Regulation (ISR), and DoD 5220.22-M-Sup 1, National Industrial Security Pro-gram Operating Manual Supplement (NISPOMSUP), implement NISP requirements.  The NISPOMestablishes uniform security policies, practices, and procedures to ensure the proper safeguarding ofclassified information throughout industry.1.1.2. The NISPOM implements applicable Federal statutes, executive orders, and national direc-tives.1.1.3. The NISPOM prescribes requirements, restrictions and other safeguards that are necessary toprevent the unauthorized disclosure of classified information and to control authorized disclosure ofclassified information by US Government Executive Branch Departments and Agencies to their con-tractors.  The NISPOM replaces DoD 5220.22-M, Defense Industrial Security Manual  for Safeguard-ing Classified Information, January 1991.1.1.4. The NISPOMSUP prescribes special security measures to ensure the integrity of SpecialAccess Programs (SAPs), Restricted Data (RD), and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI),and imposes supplemental controls to  those security requirements prescribed in the NISPOM.1.1.5. Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security, implements E.O. 12829, NationalIndustrial Security Program, DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Man-ual, and DoD 5220.22-R, Industrial Security Regulation.  Air Force Instruction (AFI) 31-601, Indus-trial Security Program Management, provides broad guidance necessary to implement the NISP,NISPOM and ISR uniformly, and this handbook addresses general "how to," "lessons learned," and"best business" practices.1.2. Scope:1.2.1. The NISPOM applies to all executive branch departments and agencies and to all DoD clearedcontractor facilities located within the United States, its territories and possessions.1.2.2. The NISPOM shall be used by DoD contractors to safeguard classified information releasedduring all phases of the contracting, licensing, and grant process, including bidding, negotiation,award, performance, and termination.1.2.3. The NISPOM also applies to classified information not released under a contract, license, cer-tificate or grant, and to foreign government information furnished to DoD contractors that requiresprotection in the interest of national security.1.2.4. The NISPOM prescribes "baseline" security standards for safeguarding collateral classifiedinformation.  Imposing protection requirements more stringent than those prescribed by the NISPOMon contractor operations designated as "cleared facilities" is not authorized, nor will waivers or excep-tions be granted.  This provision does not apply to on-base contractors operating under the terms of agovernment/ contractor negotiated Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA).41.2.5. The NISP encompasses all security disciplines, i.e., personnel, information, computer, physi-cal, operations security (OPSEC), communications security (COMSEC), and emission security(EMSEC), to include international and special access program protection requirements.1.3. Administration and Oversight:1.3.1. The National Security Council (NSC) is responsible for providing overall policy for the NISP.1.3.2. The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) serves as the NISP "Executive Agent," and is responsiblefor overall program administration.1.3.3. The Director, Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO), is responsible for implementingand monitoring the NISP and for issuing implementing direction that shall be binding in all federalagencies.1.3.4. The Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Energy (DoE), the Defense NuclearRegulatory Commission (NRC), and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) jointly share NISPOMsecurity cognizance and oversight responsibilities.  These agencies have the authority to further dele-gate "security administration" type responsibilities internally or externally to another agency whichwill serve as that agency’s "Cognizant Security Office" (CSO).1.3.5. The Defense Investigative Service (DIS) is DoD’s designated CSO and is responsible for over-seeing implementation of NISPOM requirements for all off-base AF classified contracts.1.3.6. The Air Force Chief of  Security Police (HQ USAF/SP) has been delegated responsibility forformulating industrial security policy and providing broad program guidance and oversight.1.3.7. The Air Force Chief of Security Police, Information Security Division (AF/SPI), is the AirForce focal point for policy development and program oversight of the AF Industrial Security Pro-gram.1.3.8. At major command ( MAJCOM) and installation level, security police units or a designatedequivalent, manages, provides guidance, and oversees implementation of the installation’s industrialsecurity program.1.3.9. The Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Plans, Policy, and Evaluation Directorate, HQUSAF/INX, is responsible for management of the Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) secu-rity program.1.3.10. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Communications and Information, Director, Architectures andTechnology (HQ USAF/SCT), is responsible for the information protection, communications security(COMSEC), computer security (COMPUSEC), and emission security (EMSEC) programs (formerlyTEMPEST), as outlined in AFPD 33-2, Information Protection.1.3.11. The Director of Plans, HQ USAF/XOX, is responsible for the Operations Security Program(OPSEC).1.3.12. The Assistant Secretary (Contracting), SAF/AQC, is responsible for contracting policy andimplementation.5Chapter 2GENERAL PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITIES AND FUNCTIONS2.1. Air Force Activity (System, Program or Project Manager):2.1.1. The system, program, or project manager responsibilities are, but not limited to:2.1.1.1. Initiating procurement requests and identifying and incorporating program unique indus-trial security requirements into contract documents.2.1.1.2. Drafting and incorporating program specific security classification guidance into the DDForm 254, DoD Contract Security Classification Specifications.2.1.1.3. Discussing contract and security requirements with the contracting office and responsibleinstallation security discipline OPRs.2.1.1.4. Reviewing, revising and modifying security classification guidance, as appropriate.2.2. Contracting Officer Responsibilities:2.2.1. MAJCOM and field level contracting offices implement the NISPOM by incorporating spe-cific security clauses into classified contract documents as outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regu-lations (FAR), as supplemented by DoD and Air Force guidance.2.2.2. The contracting officer negotiates all contractual agreements, modifications, changes, revi-sions, and is responsible for ensuring NISPOM implementation and contractor compliance.2.2.3. The contracting officer coordinates all security requirements associated with classified con-tracts with the SSA and other installation security discipline OPRs or agencies, such as those respon-sible for computer security, emission security, foreign disclosure, information management,operations security, public affairs, etc.2.2.4. Additional contracting officer responsibilities include, but are not limited to:2.2.4.1. Incorporating any special security requirements into a contract, in addition to those iden-tified in the NISPOM.2.2.4.2. Initiating requests for Facility Clearance (FCL) action.2.2.4.3. Authorizing release of classified information by contractors at seminars, meetings, andsymposiums when authorization is required.2.2.4.4. Authorizing retention of classified material by contractor.2.2.4.5. Authorizing contractors to visit government activities and/or facilities in support of a spe-cific classified work effort.2.2.4.6. Reviewing and signing DD Form 254 and resolving security classification problems.2.2.4.7.

Delegating specific responsibilities via letter, directive, supplement, memorandum ofunderstanding (MOU), memorandum of agreement (MOA),  to other government or AF activities,as appropriate, in support of NISPOM implementation.62.3. Installation Commander Responsibilities:2.3.1. Installation commanders derive their authority to control access (grant, limit, or deny) to theinstallation under Title 5, U.S.C., Title 10 U.S.C. 2.3.4.2.3.2. The installation commander may deny a contractor employee access to the installation forcause.  This action is considered separate and distinct from any PCL action.  It is prudent, when mak-ing a recommendation to the commander or sending correspondence to a contractor or a contractoremployee regarding the revocation of  base access privileges, to avoid any reference to the individual’sPCL, its status, or how it may be impacted.2.3.3. The installation commander establishes and designates on-base contractor operations ascleared facilities, visitor groups, and/or intermittent visitors per authority of DoD 5220.22-R, Indus-trial Security Regulation, AFPD 31-6, Industrial Security, and AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Pro-gram Management.2.3.4. DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), recog-nizes the installation commander’s authority to establish installation security program requirementsequivalent to NISPOM baseline security standards for contractors operating within the confines of theinstallation.2.3.5. The installation commander designates an activity to perform industrial security program over-sight for individual on-base contractor operations (Defense Investigative Service (DIS) or ServicingSecurity Activity (SSA).  In most instances, this responsibility is entrusted to the installation securitypolice or an equivalent on-base security activity.2.3.6. The installation commander determines the frequency of security reviews for on-base contrac-tors designated as visitor groups per AFI 31-601 guidance, to include approving the security reviewreport format.2.3.7. The installation commander authorizes the appropriate agency (CSO or SSA) to conduct secu-rity reviews for on-base contractors designated as cleared facilities in accordance with NISPOMrequirements and in concert with the CSO.2.3.8. The installation commander may designate other government or AF activities via letter, direc-tive, supplement, MOA, MOU, etc., to perform specific duties in support of NISPOM implementa-tion.2.4. Defense Investigative Service (DIS) Responsibilities:2.4.1. DIS has been designated by the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) as the Cognizant SecurityOffice (CSO) for the Department of Defense (DoD), including the military service components.  DISadministers the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) in accordance with national and DoDpolicy.  This responsibility extends to all cleared facility operations, regardless of their geographicallylocation (on or off-base), except as specified in the NISPOMSUP.  NOTE:  As used in this handbook,the acronym "CSO" encompasses all DIS entities, i.e., headquarters, regional or field offices, centersand representatives.2.4.2. DIS has three primary missions relevant to the National Industrial Security Program (NISP):(1) conducting personnel clearances (PCLs) investigations for contractors, (2) granting facility clear-ances (FCLs), and (3) providing industrial security program oversight for cleared facilities.  This7agency is configured into a number of geographical  regions, with each regional headquarters beingresponsible for those cleared contractor facilities falling within their respective jurisdiction.2.4.3. DIS establishes and maintains a network of automated systems which provides real-time PCL/FCL data pertaining to contractor employees and facilities, to include intermittent visitors and/or vis-itor groups, although on-base oversight responsibility normally rests with the SSA.  DIS’s PersonnelInvestigative Center, Central Verification Activity (PIC-CVA), Baltimore MD, monitors, updates,and provides a PCL and FCL verification service.2.4.4. DIS assumes industrial security program oversight responsibility for on-base cleared facilitiesat the request of the installation commander.2.4.5. Only DIS has the authority to issue or terminate a contractor’s PCL or FCL.2.4.6. The CSO is responsible for and available to provide technical and quality control guidance tothose SSAs having oversight responsibility for on-base cleared facilities.2.4.7. The CSO is responsible for interpreting contractor submitted inquiries regarding NISPOMsecurity requirements.2.4.8. The CSO conducts security reviews for DoD contractor operations (cleared facilities) locatedoff the installation and on occasions may be authorized to conduct security reviews for on-basecleared facilities, when determined appropriate by the installation commander.2.5. Servicing Security Activity (SSA) Responsibilities:2.5.1. At base level, the National Industrial Security Program is implemented by the installation com-mander via the contracting officer through a designated security activity, usually the installation secu-rity police unit or an equivalent security activity, and thereafter termed the "Servicing SecurityActivity" (SSA).2.5.2. The designated SSA implements the industrial security program for the installation.  Thisactivity provides technical expertise, advice, and assistance to the installation commander, AF activi-ties, contracting office, and other base entities regarding NISPOM requirements and their applicabil-ity.  The SSA may be staffed by security police personnel or Department of the Air Force Civilian(DAFCs) security specialists, or a combination thereof.2.5.3. The SSA may be responsible for other installation functions commonly associated with Secu-rity Police Administrations (SPA), i.e., information and personnel security, reports and analysis, andpass and registration, resources protection and crime prevention.  Regardless of SSA’s organizationalhome, its industrial security program responsibility remains unchanged.2.5.4. The SSA provides industrial security program guidance and oversight for all visitor groupsunder the authority of the installation commander.  This authority may extend to on-base cleared facil-ities, when determined appropriate by the installation commander.2.5.5. The SSA coordinates and resolves contract security performance issues or problems via thecontracting office for visitor groups.  For on-base cleared facilities, the SSA consults with the CSOand contracting office when problems arise concerning contract security performance.2.5.6. The SSA interacts closely (installation security focal point) with the Communications andInformation, Intelligence, Public Affairs, Operations Security, International Affairs, and contractingactivity to ensure appropriate and approved security measures and/or safeguards are implemented to8prevent the unauthorized disclosure or loss of classified or sensitive unclassified information.  Baseagencies identified below can provide expertise in the following areas:2.5.6.1. Communications Unit - Information Protection (COMSEC, COMPUSEC, EMSEC, ForOfficial Use Only (FOUO), and Privacy Act issues).2.5.6.2. Intelligence Activity - SCI related matters, threat data, and counterintelligence.2.5.6.3. International Affairs Activity - disclosure of U.S. classified information to foreign enti-ties.2.5.6.4. Public Affairs Activity - guidance on disclosure and/or release of USAF information tothe general public.2.5.6.5. Plans & Operations Activity - guidance on identifying operational weaknesses and sug-gested countermeasures to defend against intelligence collection efforts.2.5.7. The SSA discusses and coordinates security performance issues with the contracting office,and when appropriate, the CSO.  This same principle applies equally to contract modifications or revi-sions.2.5.8. SSAs designated security oversight responsibilities for on-base cleared facilities, performsduties (surveys, security reviews, form completion or submission, etc.) per DoD 5220.22-R, in con-cert with the CSO.2.5.9. Although not responsible for all security requirements identified in DD Form 254, the SSA isregarded by installation activities, acquisition community, and contracting office as the installationfocal point for security guidance.  Most security issues will be directed to the SSA for guidance or res-olution.  Security issues outside the scope of the SSA’s responsibility should be immediately referredto the appropriate installation security discipline OPR.2.6. DoD Contractor’s Responsibilities:2.6.1. Contractors participating in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP) execute a DDForm 441, Department of Defense Security Agreement, as an eligibility prerequisite.  The DDForm 441, which is contractually imposed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.204-2,Security Requirements, requires the contractor to establish and implement applicable portions of DoD5220.22-M., National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM).2.6.2. Under the terms of the DD Form 441, the contractor agrees to establish and comply with theapplicable provisions of the NISPOM.  Execution of the DD Form 441 gives DoD the authority toconduct periodic security reviews to verify compliance with the terms of the agreement and specificcontract security requirements.2.6.3. The DD Form 441 may be terminated by either the government or the contractor.  However,termination of the security agreement is usually done by the government when a contractor is nolonger active in the NISP, or no longer eligible for continued performance in the program, or has dem-onstrated an unwillingness to comply with the requirements of the agreement or pertinent securityrequirements.2.6.4. The contractor’s baseline source of industrial security guidance is the NISPOM whichaddresses the general security requirements contractually imposed on the contractor by the federalgovernment.  However, additional security requirements may be imposed by the Air Force at govern-9ment expense, provided they are consistent with DoD policy and are clearly identified in contractingdocuments.2.6.5. The contractor’s responsibilities are defined by the terms of a negotiated contract.  The DDForm 254,  DoD Contract Security Classification Specification, DD Form 441, Department ofDefense Security Agreement, Statement of Work (SOW),  Statement of Objectives (SOO), Perfor-mance Work Standards (PWS), and/or Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA) identify those spe-cific security requirements applicable to the contractor’s performance.2.6.6. Contractors are not subject to most Air Force policies or instructions, unless their complianceis mandated under the terms of a negotiated contractual agreement.2.6.7. Contractors performing on a classified contract are required to sponsor those employees andconsultants that require access to classified information.  In addition, they are required to report anyadverse information that may impact any cleared individual’s eligibility to maintain a PCL to the CSO.10Chapter 3TYPES OF DOD CONTRACTOR OPERATIONS3.1. Cleared Facilities:3.1.1. A cleared facility is a non-government owned or operated industrial, educational, commercial,or other facility for which DoD has made an administrative determination (from a security viewpoint)that the entity is eligible for access to classified information of a certain category (Confidential,Secret, or Top Secret).3.1.2. On-base cleared facilities are established at the discretion of the installation commander, whodecides whether the installation SSA or the CSO will have security oversight and responsibility forthese designated contractor facilities.3.1.3. Cleared facilities comply with and are subject to the requirements of the NISPOM, regardlessof geographic location or responsible oversight agency.3.1.4. The SSA oversee on-base cleared facility operations IAW DoD 5220.22-R, AFPD 31-6, andAFI 31-601 guidance.3.1.5. On-base cleared facilities receive, store, dispatch, and process classified information under theprovisions of the NISPOM, the exception being when and where unique operating conditions or cir-cumstances dictates otherwise.3.2. Visitor Groups:3.2.1. A visitor group is a contractor operation located on an Air Force installation that requiresaccess to classified information.  It operates under the direct control of the Air Force.  It differs froma cleared facility by its close interaction and/or working relationship with an Air Force organization.Normally, the visitor group operation is integrated into and directly supports the organization’s mis-sion.  However, unlike a cleared facility, the visitor group does not have the capability to handle, pro-cess, or store classified information independent of the Air Force activity.  It differs from anintermittent visitor primarily because of its long-term presence on an installation.3.2.2. Visitor groups are established at the discretion of the installation commander under the author-ity of DoD 5220.22-R, AFPD 31-6 and AFI 31-601 to satisfy unique AF operational requirements.They are neither intermittent visitors nor cleared facilities.  Typically, they are contractor operationswhich maintain a long-term presence on an Air Force installation and that have a very interactive rela-tionship with the AF activity it is supporting.  Technically, visitor groups function as extensions of theAF activity, operating under installation security program guidance and/or the AF activity’s unit secu-rity operating instructions (OIs), or both.  (See Figure 3.1).3.2.3. Visitor groups may be authorized to operate in accordance with DoD 5200.1-R, InformationSecurity Program Regulation, or the host installation security program.  When so authorized, the spe-cific security requirements applicable to the visitor group must be identified and clearly specified inthe Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA).  The VGSA is different from, and in addition to,the DD Form 441, Department of Defense Security Agreement, and DD Form 254, DoD ContractSecurity Classification Specifications, which are required.113.2.4. The VGSA outlines safeguarding requirements for both classified and sensitive unclassifiedinformation to be disclosed under the terms of the contract.3.2.5. Visitor groups operating per DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401 are not allowed to generate, receive,or store classified information independent of the AF activity.  However, this is not the case for visitorgroups operating under NISPOM guidance nor may it be the case for visitor groups operating underinstallation security program requirements.3.2.6. Visitor groups, authorized to operate under the provisions of DoD 5200.1-R or installationsecurity program, may function and operate under AF security program procedures, provided the AFmaintains control of all classified information and the visitor group’s access is limited to contract-spe-cific information.  NOTE:  As used in this paragraph, "control" means stored in an AF owned secu-rity container, processed on AF owned equipment, transmitted via AF control requirements, andoccurs at a location or facility over which the AF has jurisdiction.3.2.7. Visitor group establishment is limited to areas or property over which the AF exercises juris-diction.  This includes auxiliary and detached installations.3.2.8. Security program oversight responsibility for visitor groups rests with the designated SSAunder the authority of the installation commander.3.3. Intermittent Visitors:3.3.1. The intermittent visitor can best be described as a cleared DoD contractor who may visit an AFinstallation on an infrequent basis for brief periods of time on a scheduled or on-call basis to performcontractual services or duties which requires access to classified information.3.3.2. Typical intermittent visitors include, but are not limited to, telephone maintenance technicians,reproduction equipment and computer technicians, etc.  Normally, the CSO provides industrial secu-rity program oversight for these types of visitors via their off-base home office facility (HOF).3.3.3. The intermittent visitor’s presence on a installation normally does not exceed 90 consecutivedays.Figure 3.1.

Facility Security Clearance (FCL) Requirements:4.1.1. The Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) is responsible for the establish-ment, maintenance, and termination of all contractor FCLs or PCLs.  DISCO also issues interimSECRET and CONFIDENTIAL FCLs, when possible and where practical.  This activity is located inColumbus, Ohio.  Address inquiries or correspondence as indicated below:4.1.1.1. For verification of contractor personnel security clearance (PCL) status:DISCOAttn:  S0834P.O. Box 2499Columbus, Ohio 43216-5006Telephonic Inquiries:  (614) 692-2265Telefax:  (614) 692-36634.1.1.2. For verification of facility clearance (FCL) status:Personnel Investigation Center (PIC)Central Verification Activity (CVA)P.O Box 46060Baltimore, MD 21240-6060Telephonic Inquiries:  (410) 865-2720/21Telefax:  (410) 865-2749Internet Address:  http://www.dis.mil.4.1.2. All contractors requiring access to classified information require an FCL.4.1.3. An FCL is an administrative determination that a company or firm is eligible for access to clas-sified information.  FCL eligibility is determined by the contractor’s demonstrated reliability, integ-rity, stability, and mandated ownership prerequisite.  Note:   The existence of an FCL should not beinterpreted to infer that a contractor is physically able to protect classified information.  A contrac-tor’s safeguarding capability is an additional issue that requires a separate determination. 4.2. Personnel Security Clearance (PCL) Requirements:4.2.1. DISCO issues PCLs and maintains records for all contractor personnel performing on a classi-fied contracts within the National Industrial Security Program (NISP).4.2.2. PCLs for all cleared contractor employees are retained on file at the contractor’s home officefacility (HOF) or the specific cleared facility .  The contractor HOF notifies the AF activity of all26employees requiring access to classified information (contract specific) and the status of their respec-tive PCL via VAL.4.2.3. The HOF should be tasked to forward a copy of the VAL to all contract performance locationsidentified in the contract per the AF’s guidance or instructions provided in the VGSA or other con-tracting documents.4.2.4. The VAL is completed and signed by the HOF’s FSO and serves as means of verifying andconfirming the employee’s PCL status.  The exception being when unique on-base conditions or cir-cumstances warrants otherwise, i.e. special access program (SAP), etc.4.3. Suitability Determination Background Investigations Requirements4.3.1. Contractor personnel performing on DoD contracts as a visitor group or cleared facility, on oroff -base, who are assigned duties using sensitive unclassified automated information systems (AISs)designated as ADP-I, ADP-II or ADP- III must be the subject of an investigation to determine theindividual’s suitability to occupy the position.  NOTE:  The background investigation requirement isnot applicable when the contractor employee has a valid PCL on file with DIS.4.3.1.1. The SF Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, is completed and submit-ted to:  DIS Personnel Investigation Center (PIC), P.O. Box 28989, Baltimore MD 21240-8989,for the appropriate scope and type of background investigation to be conducted.  See AFI 31-501.4.3.1.2. Once completed, DIS PIC returns the results of the investigation to the AF CAF who,in-turn, returns the investigation to the requesting activity, who makes the suitability determina-tion.  NOTE:  Investigations conducted to determine contractor employee’s suitability are notadjudicated by AF or DIS.4.3.1.3. For additional guidance see DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program.27Chapter 5VISIT NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS5.1. Pre-Announcement Notifications:5.1.1. A VAL commonly referred to as a "visit request" is a formal pre-visit announcement or notifi-cation to a government activity or contractor’s operation notifying that agency to expect the arrival ofan official visitor in support of a specific contract or program.5.1.2. Whether generated by a government activity or contractor agency, the VAL or equivalent doc-ument should contain the contractor’s name, address, telephone number, assigned CAGE Code, ifapplicable, level of FCL, and  name, date, and place of  birth, citizenship, and certification of theintending employee visitor’s security clearance.  In addition, also include:  purpose of visit, party to bevisited, and anticipated date and time of arrival and departure.5.2. Processing Requirements:5.2.1. Provide the agency or location to be visited sufficient advanced notification to verify the needfor the visit, other pertinent data, and ample time to approve or disapprove the request.5.2.2. A VAL is required to be processed for any visit during which classified information will be dis-cussed or disclosed, except when government representatives, serving in an official capacities asinspectors, investigators or auditors, visit contractor facilities.5.2.3. Incoming contractor generated VALs may be verified (PCL status confirmed) by the AF activ-ity, who approves or disapproves the visit, prior to disclosing or releasing any classified information.The AF activity publishes procedures for processing incoming VALs, to include designating VALverification officials, if appropriate and VAL repositories (AF activity, SSA, contracting, etc.).5.2.4. In addition to mailing, VALs may be verbally coordinated or FAXed to the agency to be vis-ited.  A written VAL must be submitted to confirm visits coordinated telephonically.5.2.5. Forward hard-copy visit requests directly to the agency to be visited or as directed otherwise.5.2.6. Contractor VALs submitted in support of a "classified" work effort may be accepted as beingvalid for a period of up to 12 months or for the duration of the contract, when authorized and approvedby the AF activity.28Chapter 6SECURITY REVIEW REQUIREMENTS6.1. Conducting Security Reviews for Cleared Facilities:6.1.1. The installation commander designates either the SSA or CSO to conduct security reviews foron-base cleared facilities.  SSAs designated security oversight responsibilities for cleared facilitiesperform duties (security reviews, surveys, form completion, etc.) per guidance of the DIS cognizantsecurity activity.  When and/or if required, complete either a hard-copy or automated DD Form 696,Industrial Security Inspection Report.  (See Figure 6.1.)6.1.1.1. The SSA coordinates security reviews with other installation security discipline OPRs(OPSEC, COMSEC, COMPUSEC, EMSEC, etc.) to ensure all aspects of the contract securityrequirements are addressed during the security review.6.1.1.2. Normally, letters of review are sent by the SSA directly to the contractor.  However, theSSA formally communicates the results of unsatisfactory security review results to the contractorthrough the contracting office.6.1.2. Security Review Scheduling .  Cleared facilities are scheduled for security reviews periodi-cally, consistent with risk management principles, but no more than once every 12 months unless spe-cial circumstances exist.6.1.3. Notification of Pending Security Review .  Cleared facilities are normally given advancedwritten notice, unless an unannounced security review is to be conducted.  Unannounced securityreviews must be justified (unsatisfactory security review rating, major deficiencies, etc.) and haveSSA commander or equivalent official approval.6.1.4. The Role of the SSA:6.1.4.1. The SSA confirms compliance with security requirements, identifies weaknesses in thecontractor’s security program, and recommends appropriate corrective action.6.1.4.2. The intent of the security review is to provide evidence of compliance and/or incidentalnoncompliance with contract security requirements.  This process identifies both programstrengths and weaknesses and assists the SSA in determining appropriate corrective actions.6.1.5. Pre-Security Review Planning:6.1.5.1. The SSA discusses and coordinates plans (in advance) with the on-base contractor’s facil-ity security officer (FSO) or representative prior to conducting a security review.  Pre-securityreview planning considerations may include:6.1.5.1.1. Reviewing last security review records.6.1.5.1.2. Reviewing security violation reports since last security review.6.1.5.1.3. Reviewing DD Form 254, Statement of Work, Visitor Group Security Agreement(VGSA), etc.6.1.5.1.4. Reviewing other correspondence, as applicable.6.1.5.2. The SSA evaluates data and information compiled during the pre-security review to makeplans for conducting the formal security review.296.1.6. Security Review Inbrief6.1.6.1. Whenever possible, schedule a meeting via the FSO with the contractor’s senior on-basemanagement officials prior to the beginning of the formal security review.6.1.6.2. The in-brief is a short explanation of the purpose and intent of the security review. It alsoprovides an opportunity for informal SSA and contractor interaction.6.1.7. Security Review Techniques6.1.7.1. Be knowledgeable of security standards and the specific security requirements applicableto the contract.  Apply sound judgment to problem areas, don’t get wrapped up in technicalitiesand use common sense.6.1.7.2. Follow plan articulated during the pre-security review.6.1.8. Conducting Unannounced Security Reviews6.1.8.1. Unannounced security reviews are conducted for cause (unsatisfactory rating, major defi-ciency, etc.) to confirm that appropriate corrective actions have been initiated, taken, or imple-mented which properly protect classified information.6.1.8.2. Whenever possible, conduct unannounced security reviews during time periods whencompany management and/or key personnel are available to answer questions, participate and/orinteract with SSA personnel.6.1.9. The Exit Briefing6.1.9.1. Brief the on-base contractor’s senior management officials and FSO or security represen-tative at the conclusion of the security review, providing accurate feedback on their overall secu-rity posture.6.1.9.2. Make only generic reference to minor administrative issues.  Stress the positive aspects ofthe contractor’s security program and give personal recognition, when appropriate.6.1.10. Unsatisfactory Security Reviews6.1.10.1. Normally, an unsatisfactory rating is given when the results of the security review dem-onstrates the contractor’s inability or unwillingness to properly safeguard classified information orrepeated failure to correct major deficiencies.6.1.10.2. Promptly coordinate the results of security reviews rated as "unsatisfactory" with thecontracting office and CSO.6.1.10.3. An unsatisfactory rating may be justification for FCL revocation.  The SSA may makesuch a recommendation to the CSO via the contracting office, depending upon the severity of thesituation or problem.6.1.10.4. Suspension of the cleared facility’s safeguarding capability is also an option available,pending resolution of the security deficiency.6.1.10.5. Notifying the cleared facility of adverse revocation/ suspension actions is the responsi-bility of the contracting office.6.2. Conducting Security Reviews for Visitor Groups:306.2.1. Security reviews are not conducted  for visitor groups operating under DoD 5200.1-R/AFI31-401, Managing The Information Security Program.6.2.2. Visitor groups designated to operate under DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401 are evaluated in accor-dance with installation information security program requirements, and the sponsoring AF activity’ssecurity operating instructions (OIs).6.3. Conducting NISPOM Equivalent Security Reviews for Visitor Groups:6.3.1. When determined appropriate by the installation commander, NISPOM equivalent securityreviews may be conducted for visitor groups operating under the auspices of the installation securityprogram.6.3.2. Conduct NISPOM equivalent security reviews as outlined in the installation security programsupplement and VGSA.  Normally, a combination of  DoD 5220.22-M, DoD 5200.1-R, and installa-tion security program specific requirements are reviewed when conducting this type of securityreview.Figure 6.1. Instructions for Completion of DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection Report.1.  Executing DD Form 696.  The DD Form 696 is undergoing revisions.  In addition, an automated ver-sion of the form will soon be made available.  Instructions listed below are applicable to the most current (hardcopy) version and are provided as recommendations for completing the form.  Use of the DD Form 696 is mandatory for cleared facilities and the CSO will provide the SSA guidance on its completion and submission.  AFI 31-601 makes its use optional for on-base visitor groups.  However, data fields on the form are not intended for visitor groups.  Suggested completion instructions are offered.      a.  Item 1. Date Prepared.  Date entered as numbers, year first, then month, then day.  For example:  September 14, 1993 is entered as 930914.      b.  Item 2.  Facility.  Enter complete data.      c.  Item 2b.  Address.  List physical address.      d.  Item 2c.  CAGE Code.  Data field does not apply to visitor groups.  Also known as a Federal Sup-ply Code Number (FSCN).  They are established and maintained by the Defense Logistics Supply Center, Battle Creek, MI for other reasons.  They are used by the CSO to identify individual cleared facilities.  Each cleared facility has a separate CAGE code.  They are not issued to visitor groups.  The CSO advises the SSA when temporary or final codes are issued for cleared facilities.      e.  Item 3.  Home Office.  Identify the facility which executed the DD Form 441 which drives cleared facility or visitor group status for the operation.  There may be an intermediary cleared division providing management and security oversight for the cleared facility or visitor group.  This is known as a Principal Management Facility (PMF), but PMFs are not always home offices.  Do not list the PMF in this data 31field.  However, since PMFs provide primary management oversight for the cleared facility or visitor group, when applicable, they may be referenced in the remarks section.      f.  Item 4.  Parent Holding Company.  This data field may be left blank.      g.  Item 5.  Facility Security Supervisor.  Identify by name and telephone number of the on-base con-tractor employee specified by company management to ensure contractor compliance with security requirements.      h.  Item 6.  Facility Clearance.  Data field is intended for cleared facilities.      i.  Item 6a.  Level.  For cleared facilities, the highest level of classified access permitted by the cleared facility.  For visitor groups, the highest level of classified access authorized for site performance.      j.  Item 6b.  Type.  Not applicable for visitor groups.      k.  Item 6c.  Type of Foreign Interest Resolution.  Might apply to either cleared facilities or visitor groups.  If the HOFs FCL has been established based on one of the formula FOCI resolutions noted, check the appropriate box.  If the FCL of the HOF has been established based on a Special Security Agreement (SSA), classified access restrictions will also apply to cleared facilities or visitor groups on-base.  The CSO can provide guidance on this subject.      l.  Item 6d.  Clearance Date.  Applies only to cleared facilities.  It may be left blank for visitor groups.      m.  Item 6e.  Applies only to cleared facilities.  The CSO categorizes cleared facilities by degree of complexity, using a weighted point system.  Each cleared facility is categorized, from "A" through "E," with "A" being the most complex and difficult to inspect. The CSO provides categorization instructions to the SSA and the SSA computes the category and reports the information to the CSO.      n.  Item 6f.  Security Review Frequency.  Cleared facilities are inspected in accordance with DOD policy.  Pursuant to AFI 31-601, the frequency of security reviews for on-base cleared facilities is deter-mined by the installation commander.      o.  Item 7.  Type of Business.  Brief description of the nature of the contractor’s work on site.  For example:  "Computer hardware services."      p.  Item 8.  Dates of Inspection.  List data numerically by year, month and date.  Project next inspec-tion for end of scheduled month.  Do not project unscheduled inspection on the report.      q.  Item 9.  Time Expended.  The CSO accounts for time expended as "TRIP" time, to report time spent on "T" for travel, "R" for presurvey research, to include time spent discussing the action with the contracting office and/or the CSO, "SR" security review, the actual time spent at the contractor site, and "P" for time expended in post survey actions, to include time needed to prepare the survey report and time 32spent immediately following the survey to coordinate with the contractor and ensure prompt submission of required documentation.  Trip time must be reported for cleared facilities, and may be required for vis-itor groups, if directed by the command.  For cleared facilities, the CSO normally requests that data be reported to the nearest half hour.      r.  Item 10.  Total Number of Employees.  Self explanatory.      s.  Item 11.  Number of US Employees Cleared.  Employees may not be cleared at a level higher than that of the FCL.  For visitor groups, employees may not be afforded classified access higher than the stated level of the contract.      t.  Item 12.  Number of Non-US Citizens.  Self explanatory.      u.  Item 13.  Number of Non-US Citizens With Limited Access Authorizations (LAAs). Self explanatory.      v.  Item 14.  Access to Classified Material Since Last Security Review.  Items 14d, e, and f do not apply to on -base cleared facilities.  Item 14b does not normally apply to on-base cleared facilities, but is intended to address HOFs who send intermittent visitors to customers.  Item 14g refers to Special Access Programs for which the CSO (or the SSA) has been relieved of security review duties.  If the CSO or SSA representatives encounters a suspected SAP during the course of the security review, document available information on it in the remarks section of the DD Form 696 and refer the matter through command chan-nels to SAF/AAZ for confirmation.      w.  Item 15.  Inspection.  Report the nature and results of the security review by checking the appro-priate boxes.      x.  Item 15a.  Scope.  Partial security reviews are only authorized to confirm compliance with correc-tive action following an unsatisfactory security review rating.      y.  Item 15b.  Rating Assigned.  Coordinate with the contracting officer and CSO before assigning an unsatisfactory security review rating to a cleared facility.  Coordinate with the contracting officer and home office before assigning an unsatisfactory rating to a visitor group, when applicable.      z.  Item 15c.  Results.  "NO DEF" means no deficiencies were cited during the security review.  "COS" means "Corrected On the Spot."  It reflects that minor deficiencies were noted but corrected promptly during the security review.  "LOR" means "Letter of Requirements" and indicates that minor deficiencies were noted that were not corrected during the security review and are specified in the security review results letter.  "MAJOR" reports serious incidents or conditions at the cleared facility or visitor group, if applicable, resulting in the probable loss or compromise of classified information and/or system-atic failures of the company’s security program which could result in loss or compromise of classified information.  MAJOR deficiencies may result in the assignment of an unsatisfactory security review rat-ing.33      aa.  Item 16.  Elements of Security Review and Ratings Assigned.  This form was intended to address cleared facility scenarios.  Data fields do not always relate to visitor group scenarios.  Annotate the blocks that apply to the cleared facility or visitor group.  For example, block "A," "Facility Clearance," applies to all cleared facilities, but does not apply to visitor groups.  Reflect "S" or "U" for a cleared facil-ity and "N/A" for a visitor group .  Block "B," "Access Authorizations," may apply to cleared facilities and visitor groups.  Block "K," "Classified Storage," does not apply to visitor groups, but might apply to cleared facilities.      bb.  Item 17.  Safeguarding Ability.  Applies to cleared facilities only.      cc.  Item 18.  Approved Storage Facilities.  Applies to cleared facilities only.  Unless contract lan-guage clearly specifies otherwise, the terms "Restricted Area" and "Closed Area" will refer to terms defined by the NISPOM.      dd.  Item 19.  Other DOD Programs.  Blocks 19a and b refer to programs monitored by the CSO which are not addressed by the SSA.      ee.  Item 20.  Number of Uncleared Locations With Cleared Personnel.  This data field is intended to address cleared PMFs.  It has no meaning for on-base cleared facilities or visitor groups.  Reflect "N/A" for this item.      ff.  Item 21.  ISR Number.  Annotate this data field "N/A."  This data field normally does not apply to SSA specialist performing surveys.  It is intended to identify CSO representatives.      gg.  Item 22.  Remarks.  Report any and all information of special interest relating to the cleared facil-ity or visitor group security review.      hh.  Item 23.  Security Specialists.  Self-explanatory.      ii.  Item 24.  Reviewing Official.  Self-explanatory.34Chapter 7FOREIGN OWNERSHIP, CONTROL, OR INFLUENCE (FOCI)7.1. FOCI Overview and Impact7.1.1. Federal legislation restricts the dissemination of critical technologies, classified and unclassi-fied, to foreign interests.  Foreign ownership of critical US companies has been addressed by DoDpolicy for decades.  Establishment and continuance of a company’s FCL is predicated, in part, on thefacility’s ability to demonstrate its freedom from inappropriate FOCI.  FOCI can pose problems forcontractors and disrupt the Air Force mission.  However, close interaction between the SSA, CSO,Contracting Officer, and foreign disclosure authorities offer ready solutions to most FOCI problems.7.1.1.1. DoD policy directs that, when elements of major FOCI are evident, the company’s FCLbe invalidated by the CSO.  Contracting officers are notified of the action by the CSO.7.1.1.2. An invalidation is a very serious condition which threatens FCL revocation.  Invalidationsignals to the contracting officer that the FCL may be revoked in the near future if a satisfactoryresolution of the FOCI problem is not found.7.1.1.3. Revocation of the FCL affects the status of currently issued classified contracts.  Whennotified by the CSO that an FCL has been invalidated for FOCI, contracting officers and programmanagers should review and plan for possible alternatives.  The CSO addresses and resolvesFOCI.7.2. DOD FOCI Policy:7.2.1. DoD FOCI policy is stated in DoD 5220.22-R, Industrial Security Regulation (ISR).7.2.1.1. Contractors report FOCI by executing and submitting to the DIS a Certificate Pertainingto Foreign Interests (DD Form 441s) with complete explanatory information.7.2.1.2. The HOF executes the DD Form 441S, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interest, forcleared facilities located on the installation, when applicable.7.2.1.3. DIS monitors a company’s ongoing involvement with foreign interests and  notifies theAir Force contracting office when influence from foreign interests becomes serious.  Invalidationof the FCL is considered only when major FOCI elements are reported.7.3. Resolution of FOCI Issues.   DIS resolves FOCI issues by completely neutralizing the foreigninfluence (via changes in voting trust or proxy agreement) or  modifying the FCL (via reciprocal FCL orFCL based on special security agreement), when appropriate.7.4. FOCI Special Security Agreements:7.4.1. Special Security Agreements are negotiated arrangements between DoD, the acquiring foreigninterest and the acquired US company.  They are the basis for establishment of special FCLs withnegotiated classified access restrictions.7.4.2. Special Security Agreements permit foreign ownership and operation of a US company.  Theinfluence of the foreign interest is neutralized by agreements with the foreign interest and the estab-35lishment of internal administrative procedures within the acquired US company intended to deter anddetect instances of noncompliance with those agreements.7.4.3. DOD policy considers Special Security Agreements to be fully acceptable methods to neutral-ize the influence of the foreign interest.  Companies cleared based on Special Security Agreement areconsidered to be US owned and operated for purposes of bidding on Air Force classified contracts.7.4.4. A user agency may justify and request a company be cleared under a Special Security Agree-ment to isolate FOCI.  This justification for such Special Security Agreement is called a NationalInterest Determination (NID).7.4.4.1. The NID is a agency level risk analysis, determination, and acceptance used to justify theneed for an Special Security Agreement.  ASD(C3I) approve the establishment of a Special Secu-rity Agreement.7.4.4.2. Contracting officers sponsor NIDs when the foreign interest refuses to accept the moretraditional FOCI solutions, when an alternative action will result in an unacceptable delay, orwhen the prospective contractor is the sole source.7.4.4.3. NID sponsorships are submitted through command channels to HQ USAF/SPI.  NIDsponsorships involving Special Access Program information are submitted through SAP com-mand channels to SAF/AAZ for consideration.  NIDs are transmitted by the Administrative Assis-tant to the Secretary of the Air Force, SAF/AA, to ASD(C3I).7.4.4.4. NID sponsorships include:7.4.4.4.1. Complete identification of the facility and the nature of the foreign involvement.7.4.4.4.2. Identification of current and pending classified contracts with the company.7.4.4.4.3. Explanation of the company’s products and/or services and why they are critical tothe Air Force mission.  If sole source, so state.7.4.4.4.4. Identification of the negative impact to the Air Force mission if the company’sproducts/services were no longer available.7.4.4.4.5. Description of efforts taken to discover or develop alternate sources of supply toreduce Air Force dependency on a foreign owned supplier and why they were ineffective.7.4.4.4.6. If possible, explain the planned efforts to discover or develop alternate sources ofsupply in the future.7.4.4.4.7. NIDs are reviewed periodically by the sponsoring activity and vacated when nolonger necessary.36Chapter 8INDUSTRIAL SECURITY  PROGRAM REPORTS AND RECORDS8.1. Industrial Security Program Reports:8.1.1. The SSA prepares industrial security program related reports in accordance with DoD policy,AFI 31-401, AFI 31-601, and/or installation security program, as applicable.  The facility’s designa-tion (cleared facility or visitor group) will normally determine reporting requirements.  Most reportsare submitted by the SSA as follows:8.1.1.1. For cleared facilities, send cleared facility’s management a notification letter in advanceof pending security reviews and a subsequent letter noting the results following such securityreviews.  Advanced notification is not required for conducting unannounced no-notice securityreviews for cleared facilities.  For visitor groups operating in accordance with installation securityprogram requirements, send a notification letter to the visitor groups’ on-base management and AFactivity, if appropriate.  Security reviews are not conducted for visitor groups operating strictlyunder AFI 31-401.8.1.1.2. Comply with CSO requests for reports and other administrative actions relating to clearedfacilities.  The following reports are sent to the CSO:8.1.1.2.1. Reports of cleared facilities security violations or compromises of classified mate-rial. For visitor groups operating under AFI 31-401, report only compromises to the CSO viathecontracting office, and process all other security violations in accordance with AFI 31-401,unless the severity of the violation warrants CSO notification.8.1.1.2.2. Copies of administrative inquiries conducted into those incidents of violations/com-promises, with identification of employee culpability, where known.8.1.1.2.3. Decision to downgrade or declassify information as a result of such contractordetermined security violations.8.1.1.2.4. Adverse information developed by the AF or disclosed by the contractor, relating toan employee of a cleared facility or visitor group, which is reportable pursuant to NISPOMrequirements.8.1.1.2.5. Forms and reports essential to the establishment and maintenance of the FCL, toinclude DD Forms 374, DD Forms 441, DD Forms 696, and correspondence relating to secu-rity reviews.8.1.1.2.6. Forms, reports, or other documentation prepared in connection with visitor groupsare not sent to the CSO, unless mandated by the severity of the situation.8.2. Establishment of Industrial Security File Folders:8.2.1. Each SSA establishes and maintains industrial security files in accordance with ISR, MAJ-COM, and, when applicable, local direction.  The following recommendations are offered to helpSSAs maintain such records in a uniform fashion.378.2.1.1. Contract Documents and DD Form(s) 254, DoD Contract Security Classification Spec-ification.  Current DD Forms 254, along with pertinent security requirements portions of contractdocuments are retained for all current and pending classified procurements for cleared facilitiesand visitor groups.  Destroy official records in accordance with AFMAN 37-139.8.2.1.2. DD Form 374, DoD Facility Security Clearance Survey Data Sheet.  This form docu-ments facility structure, ownership and history.  The purpose of the survey is to determine that thecontractor is capable of properly safeguarding classified information for precontract negotiations,and that the contractor is fully cognizant of the responsibilities involved in safeguarding classifiedinformation.  It is a prerequisite to granting the FCL.  It is used for cleared facilities and may beused for visitor groups, if and/or when appropriate.Partial survey reports are permitted, not more than one DD Form 374 may be retained on file.  Asa general rule, a complete history of ownership, address and name changes is evident in the DDForm 374s.  It is unimportant whether this history is reported in one complete DD Form 374 orseveral partial DD Forms 374.  Maintain your record copy of DD Form 374 in accordance withAFMAN 37-139.  (See Figure 8.1.)8.2.1.3. DD Form 441, DoD Security Agreement.  Each cleared facility retains a copy of theHOF DD Form 441 on file.  The SSA also retains a copy.  This does not apply to visitor groups.8.2.1.4. DD Form 441-1, Appendage to Department of Defense Security Agreement.  Eachcleared facility has a DD Form 441-1 on file.  Normally, the DD Form 441-1 is executed by theHOF on behalf of the on-base branch or division.  However, the HOF may delegate authority tothe division to execute the form locally.  It is countersigned by the CSO or SSA, when so autho-rized.  If the form is executed locally by the division, it is submitted to the CSO for certification.The SSA does not countersign the DD Form 441-1.  The DD Form 441-1 is reexecuted to reflectchanges in name or address.  Only the most current DD Form 441-1 is retained on file by thecleared facility or the SSA.  DD Forms 441-1 are not executed by or on behalf of visitor groups.8.2.1.5. DD Form 441S, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests.  This form is executed bythe HOF for on-base cleared facilities and visitor groups.  It is submitted by the home officedirectly to the CSO.  Copies are not retained in file for on base cleared facilities or visitor groups.The SSA is familiar with this form and its purpose pursuant to its obligation to support the acqui-sition community.8.2.1.6. DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection Report.  In conformance with DoD pol-icy the  DD Form 696 is used to document security reviews of  cleared facilities.  It may also beused to document security reviews of visitor groups when so mandated by the installation securityprogram.  Furnish copies of security review reports, to include security review letters of results, tothe CSO following security reviews conducted each cleared facility.  Security review reports forvisitor groups, when applicable, are not sent to DIS.  Maintain your record copy of DD Forms 696in accordance with AFMAN 37-139.8.2.1.7. DISCO Form 562, Personnel Security Clearance Change Notification.  This is a mul-tiple usage form used within the NISP to report changes in PCL status.  The FSO of the clearedfacility can demonstrate compliance with pertinent reporting requirements by maintaining copiesof this form until the SSA has had an opportunity to review them.  Normally, they are not executedby visitor groups, but by their home office.  They are not retained in the facility files.388.2.1.8. SF 312, Classified Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA).  For both cleared facility and vis-itor group employees, once executed, the DD Form 312 is forwarded to the CSA or it’s designee(DISCO).  The SSA may confirm the existence of a properly executed SF 312s for cleared on-basecontractor personnel by contacting the designated repository.  SSAs are not required to retain filecopies of contractor executed DD Forms 312.8.2.1.9. Classified Visit Authorization Letters (VALs).   On/off base cleared facility and visi-tor group HOF’s send VALs to the designated on-base activity or facility on behalf of their clearedemployees.  VALs may be sent to the contracting officer, SSA, or directly to the AF activity to bevisited.  Procedures should be established and implemented to facilitate the  immediate processingand coordination of in-coming VALs and to afford classified access only to those authorized.VALs are retained on file at the designated location (contracting office, SSA or AF activity) andare disposed of in accordance with AFMAN 37-139.8.2.1.10. General correspondence between the cleared facility, visitor group HOF, AF activity,CSO, and/or SSA is retained as long as needed.8.3. Records Maintenance Requirements.   The SSA maintains records relating to each cleared facilityand visitor group serviced by the SSA.  The CSO may request the SSA provide copies of reports and otherrecords required for cleared facilities.  With some exceptions, similar records may also be maintained forvisitor groups, if determined appropriate by the installation commander.Figure 8.1. Instructions for Completing DD Form 374, Facility Security Clearance Survey.8.1.  Executing DD Form 374:  Execution of the DD Form 374 or equivalent automated media is manda-tory for cleared facilities.  Its use and execution may also be mandated for those visitor groups operating under the installation security programs.  NOTE:  Visitor groups falling under the preview of AFI 31-401 are exempt from this requirement.  Complete DD Form 374 as follows:      a.  Part 1.  Industrial Security Representative.  Item 1.  Credential Number.  Enter "N/A."  This data field does not apply to Air Force personnel performing such surveys.  It is intended to identify the DIS Industrial Security Representative performing the survey.      b.  Item 2.  Name.  Self explanatory.      c.  Item 3.  Signature.  Self explanatory.      d.  Item 4.  Office Symbol.  The SSA organizational symbol is listed here.      e.  Item 5.  Time Expended.  The CSO accounts for time expended as "TRIP" time, to report time spent on "T" for travel, "R" for presurvey research, to include time spent discussing the action with the contracting office and/or the CSO, "SR" for security review, the actual time spent at the contractor site, and "P" for time expended in post survey actions, to include time needed to prepare the survey report and time spent immediately following the survey to coordinate with the contractor and ensure prompt submis-39sion of required documentation.  TRIP time must be reported for cleared facilities.  Normally, this requirement is not applicable to visitor groups, unless directed by the MAJCOM or installation mandates.      f.  Item 6.  Requesting User Agency/Contractor Address.  Identify the contracting office which has sponsored the cleared facility or visitor group.      g.  Item 7.  Telephone Number.  For FCLs try to list a commercial direct dial number (DDN).  The CSO may not have access to DSN circuits.      h.  Part II.  Facility In Process.  Item 8.  Facility Identifying Information.  Submission of precise data is important.  Coordination with the contracting officer helps to ensure that data reported on this form is consistent with information reported by the contractor elsewhere on contract documentation.      i.  Item 8a.  Exact Legal Name.  Once again, precise data is important.  For example, "The Boeing Company" is a proper corporate name.  "Boeing" is not.      j.  Item 8b.  "DBA/AKA/TA".  This refers to a company’s marketing name, when different from the legal name in item 8a.  "DBA" stands for "Doing Business As."  "AKA" stands for "Also Known As."  "TA" stands for "Trading As."  The abbreviations are interchangeable for our purposes.  Company docu-mentation will usually list the legal name and then the trading name.  For example, James T. Kirk, dba "Horizons Unlimited."      k.  Item 8c.  Physical Location/Address.  Identify the physical address of the cleared facility or visi-tor group.      l.  Item 8d.  Mailing Address.  Used normally to report the classified mailing address when different from the physical address.  For cleared facilities, this is usually a post office box.  For visitor groups, only the base classified mailing address may be listed, since visitor groups do not receive classified material independently.      m.  Item 8e.  CAGE Code.  Also known as a Federal Supply Code Number (FSCN). They are estab-lished and maintained by the Defense Logistics Supply Center, Battle Creek, MI.  They are used by the CSO to identify individual cleared facilities.  Each cleared facility has a separate CAGE code.  They are not issued for visitor groups.  The CSO advises the SSA when temporary or final CAGE codes are issued for cleared facilities.      n.  Item 8f.  Clearance Level Required.  For cleared facilities, list the highest sponsored level of facility security clearance necessary for contract performance.  For visitor groups, list the highest level of classified access necessary for on base performance.      o.  Item 8g.  Safeguarding Level Required.  Applies to cleared facilities only.  Level of safeguarding cannot be higher than that of the cleared facility.  For visitor groups, list "N/A."40      p.  Item 8h.  Safeguarding Approved.  A "Yes" answer is reflected only when the SSA has confirmed the existence of satisfactory security storage hardware and implementing procedures, to include supple-mental security controls, to ensure that the cleared facility can protect adequately classified material entrusted to it.  Safeguarding may not be certified prior to establishment of the cleared facility.  For visitor groups, this data field may be left blank.      q.  Item 8i.  Number of employees.  Self explanatory.      r.  Item 8j.  Type of Business.  Identify briefly the nature of work to be provided by the contractor.  For example:  "Operates BITS."      s.  Item 8k.  Facility Point of Contact.  For cleared facilities and visitor groups, list the on site con-tractor employee who will be the liaison for purposes of contract compliance.  Identify by job title and list, for cleared facilities, a direct dial telephone number.      t.  Item 9.  Name and Address Changes During the Last 10 Years.  This data field has limited meaning for on-base cleared facilities and no meaning for visitor groups.  If a cleared facility changes its physical address during its stay on-base, this is addressable pursuant to ISR requirements.  Prior addresses and time frames should be identified.  Name changes should also be reported as they occur.      u.  Item 10a.  All on-base cleared facilities are branch offices of an MFO, as opposed to a subsidiary.  This block is checked for cleared facilities only.  Visitor groups may leave this data field blank.      v.  Item 11.  Home Office.  Identify the facility which executed the DD Form 441.  There may be an intermediary cleared division providing management and security oversight for the cleared facility or vis-itor group.  This is known as a Principal Management Facility (PMF).  A home office may be a PMF, but PMFs are not always home offices.  Do not list the PMF in this data field.  However, since PMFs provide primary management oversight for the cleared facility or visitor group, they may be referenced in the remarks section.      w.  Item 11e.  Clearance Status.  The CSO can confirm the clearance status of the home office.      x.  Item 11f.  Clearance Level Required.  A HOF must be cleared at least to the level of the classified access required for on-base performance.  A HOF may be cleared at a level higher than that required for the on-base cleared facility or visitor group.  However, a HOF may not be processed for a higher level of clearance than necessary for contract performance.  For example, a home office may have a TOP SECRET FCL when its on-base cleared facility or visitor group requires only SECRET or CONFIDEN-TIAL access.  A home office may not be sponsored for a TOP SECRET FCL for performance on a clas-sified contract requiring only SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL access.      y.  Item 11g.  Facility Point of Contact.  Identify the official at the HOF responsible for ensuring satisfactory cleared facility or visitor group compliance with contract requirements.  Include job title and direct dial telephone number.41      z.  Item 12.  Parent Corporation.  This data field has no value to the SSA or CSO for on-base cleared facilities or visitor groups.  All on-base cleared facilities are divisions or branches of HOFs under the oversight of a CSO.  The existence and status of parent organizations to the HOF are addressed by that CSO.  Visitor groups are transparent to the CSO, but the HOF sponsoring the visitor group is under CSO oversight.  Parent organizations for visitor group HOFs are addressed by the appropriate CSO and are not a visible concern for the SSA.  This data field may be left blank.      aa.  Part III.  Organizational Structure.  Owners, Officers, Directors and Executive Personnel (OODEPs).  Item 13.  Organizational structure.  Part II is concerned primarily with FCLs.  Visitor group input is required only for item 14.      bb.  Item 13c.  On-base cleared facilities are always divisions or branch offices.  No other answers in the affirmative should be reflected for this item. Remaining data field for this item may be annotated with "N/A."      cc.  Item  14.  OODEPs Identification.  List the principal management official at the on-base cleared facility or visitor group and, if different, the person assigned responsibility for ensuring compliance with security requirements.  For cleared facilities, both are cleared to the level of the FCL.  For visitor groups, both are cleared to the level of classified access necessary for on-base performance.      dd.  Part IV.  Negotiators.  Item 15.  Identification.  Negotiators are key cleared facility employees, not OODEPs by definition, whose clearances are processed concurrently with OODEP clearances at the beginning of the FCL process to ensure their prompt issuance.  Negotiator clearances are needed immedi-ately upon issuance of the FCL to ensure that the contractor can respond promptly to bid or contract needs.  Negotiator clearance documents are annotated "Negotiator" and submitted with OODEP person-nel clearance documents to the CSO.  For visitor groups, this data field may be left blank.      ee.  Part V.  Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI).  Data reported applies to HOF and parent organizations and has no meaning for on-base cleared facilities or visitor groups.  This data field may be left blank.      ff.  Part VI.  Administrative Notes.  Item 17.  Processing Data.  Completed for cleared facilities only.  Item 17a does not apply to the SSA and may be left blank.  For item 17b, the "ISFO" means "Indus-trial Security Field Office" and is intended to identify the local DIS Industrial Security Field Office assigned inspection oversight for the cleared facility. For on-base cleared facilities, this is the SSA.  For items 17c and d, include data current as of the time the form is prepared.  Suspense receipt of remaining documentation.      gg.  Part VII.  Remarks.  Include data as directed above as well as any unique operating conditions worthy of attention to assist the CSO (for cleared facilities) and subsequent SSA representatives to have a clearer understanding of the cleared facility or visitor group.42Chapter 9SECURITY CONTRACTING DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS9.1. DD Form 254,  DoD Contract Security Classification Specifications:9.1.1. The DD Form 254 is a legally binding contract document.  Its preparation (drafting and revi-sion) is a program manager responsibility.  The contracting officer is responsible for ensuring its inter-nal AF coordination and distribution.  The SSA and other installation security discipline OPRs reviewthe DD Form 254 to ensure that appropriate and approved security guidance have been incorporatedinto the contract.9.1.2. National and DoD policy directs that all potential classified procurement actions contain a DDForm 254 that identifies the security requirements so all prospective contractors understand what isrequired.  As a baseline, security requirements of the NISPOM are applicable to all classified con-tracts.  (See Figure 9.1. and Figures 9.1., Attachment 1 and Attachment 2)9.1.3. The installation commander has the authority to specify equivalent security safeguards foron-base DoD contractor operations.  These equivalent security measures must be clearly specified inthe DD  Form 254, Statement of Work (SOW) or  Performance Work Statement (PWS), and VisitorGroup Security Agreement (VGSA), when used.9.1.4. Contract security requirements must be concise, specific, and understandable to the contractor.Unclear, no value added and redundant requirements should be challenged to avoid unwarranted addi-tional costs.9.1.5. The DD Form 254, VGSA and other referenced contract documents establish contractualrequirements on the contractor to provide adequate protection for the classified information for whichit has been entrusted.9.1.6. Identify security requirements at the earliest possible stage of the procurement process, ideallybefore Milestone Zero.  For this reason, establishing and maintaining close contact with the programmanager and contracting officer is a must during the preliminary drafting of security requirements thatwill be applicable to the contract.  Plus, it fosters continued SSA, program manager and contractingofficer interaction when security related questions or problems arise.9.1.7. A revised DD Form 254 is required for the various stages of a contract, i.e., bidding stage,awards stage, revision stage or completion stage.  Preparation of DD Form 254 at these various stagesensures currency and accuracy.9.1.8. Pre-award Stage :  Prepared to inform the prospective bidders of security requirements asso-ciated with the contract.9.1.9. Award Stage :  Prepared to confirm contract security requirements.9.1.10. Revision Stage :  Prepared , as appropriate, to modify or change security requirements.Negotiating changes or modifications to a contract is a contracting officer responsibility.9.1.11. Completion Stage :  Prepared to provide disposition and/or retention instructions, as applica-ble, per AFMAN 37-139.9.1.12. In contractual terms,  security requirements identified in the DD Form 254 are "deliverables,"and must be satisfied as a condition of the agreement or the contractor  may be subject to penalty.43Figure 9.1. Instructions for Preparing DD Form 254, DoD Contract Security Classification Specifi-cation.1.  General Information1.1.  A classified contract is any contract that requires, or will require, access to classified information by contractor personnel in performance of the contract.  (A contract may be a classified contract even though the contract document is not classified.)1.2.  The government provides guidance to prime contractors for classified contracts primarily by incor-porating DD Form 254, DoD Contract Security Classification Specification, into every classified contract.  The DD Form 254 tells the contractor what needs to be protected and to what degree.  The DD Form 254, with its attachments and incorporated references, is the only authorized means for providing security clas-sification guidance to a contractor.  It should be written as specifically as possible, and it should include only that information that pertains to the contract for which it is issued.  Do not cite government regula-tions in the DD Form 254.  The contractor rarely has the regulation and may be confused by the citing.  If access to a regulation is absolutely essential, cite the appropriate regulation in the DD Form 254.  The government program manager must ensure the contractor receives a copy of the necessary regulation.1.3.  If any attachment to the DD Form 254 includes classified information, refer to it in Item 13 as a sep-arately transmitted instruction rather than as an attachment.  Cite a short title or use whatever means nec-essary to identify such instructions without inserting classified information on the form.  Transmit classified information separately from the DD Form 254.1.4.  The contracting office forward one copy of the DD Form 254 and a copy of the SOW to the SSA for review and coordination purposes.  The SSA’s coordination is annotated in "Block 13" of the DD Form 254 or a separate attachment, if required.1.5.  The DD Form 254 must be an original, and all entries must be typewritten.  Do not staple the DD Form 254 to any other document.  For original (new buy) DD Forms 254, enter the Purchase Request (PR) number in pencil in the margin.  Corrections made using correction fluid or tape must be neat and legible.1.6.  DD Forms 254 should be forwarded to the SSA for coordination, through the base mail system if time allows.1.7.  The form must contain the signature of the certifying official prior to distribution.2.  Item-By-Item Instructions2.1.  ITEM 1.  Clearance and Safeguarding.442.1.1.  1.a.  Insert the highest level of facility clearance required by the contractor for performance of the contract.  Use only the words "TOP SECRET," "SECRET," or "CONFIDENTIAL."  Special caveats such as RESTRICTED DATA, FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA, COMSEC INFORMATION, etc., are not appropriate in this item.  The contractor must have a valid facility clearance at least as high as the clas-sification indicated in this item.2.1.2.  1.b.  Insert the highest level of safeguarding capability required by the contractor for performance of the contract.  The classification level shown in 1.b. may not be higher than that shown in Item 1.a.  If the contractor will not possess classified information at the cleared facility in performing the contract, enter "Not Applicable" (N/A) or "None."2.1.3.  NOTE:  If 11.a. is "YES," safeguarding capability IS NOT required.  If 11.b. or c. is "YES," safe-guarding capability IS required.2.2.  ITEMS 2. and 3.2.2.1.  For an original (new buy) DD Form 254:2.2.1.1.  ITEM 2.a.  Insert "X" (Contract number is entered at time of award by contracting official.)2.2.1.2.  ITEM 2.b.  Do not use.  For Prime contractor use only.2.2.1.3.  ITEM 2.c.  Insert "X" (Solicitation or other number and due date (YYMMDD).2.2.1.4.  ITEM 3.a.

Enter date of original.2.2.2.3.  ITEM 3.b.  Enter "X," latest revision number, and current date (YYMMDD).2.2.2.4.  NOTE:  The date of the original will appear unchanged on each revised DD Form 254.  Any change to DD Form 254 once it has been provided to a contractor either during the solicitation process or upon award, will be made by revising the form.  Each time a revision is issued, it shall be given a sequen-tial revision number.2.2.3.  For a final DD Form 254:2.2.3.1.  ITEM 3.a.  Enter date of original.452.2.3.2.  ITEM 3.b.  Enter latest revision number and date of latest revision (YYMMDD).2.2.3.3.  ITEM 3.c.  Enter "X" in 3.c. and current date (YYMMDD).2.2.3.4.  NOTE:  When a final DD Form 254 is issued, Item 5 is always marked "YES."  Issue a final DD Form 254 only when a contract is completed and retention of the classified material has been authorized, or the material in question is declassified.2.3.  ITEM 4:  This item pertains to follow-on contracts.  To qualify as a follow-on contract, the new con-tract must be to the same contractor for the same item or service as the preceding contract.  When these conditions exist, enter "X" in the "YES" box, and enter the preceding contract number in the space pro-vided.  This item authorizes the contractor to transfer classified material received or generated under the preceding contract to the current contract.  It is assumed that the contractor will require access to the same information for performance of the follow-on contract as was required for the previous contract.  If the preceding contract is not complete, transfer of accountability is not permitted; enter "X" in "NO."  An active contract justifies possession of the classified material.2.4.  ITEM 5.

Attachment 1, Sample Release of Non-SCI Intelligence Information to DoD Contrac-tors DD Form 254 Attachment.ATTACHMENT TO DD FORM 254 FOR CONTRACT NO:  _______________CONTRACT EXPIRATION DATE:RELEASE OF NON-SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION (NON-SCI) INTELLI-GENCE INFORMATION TO US CONTRACTORS1.  Requirements for access to non-SCI:    a.  All intelligence material released to the contractor remains the property of the US Government and may be withdrawn at any time.  Contractors must maintain accountability for all classified intelligence released into their custody.    b.  The contractor must not reproduce intelligence material without the written permission of the origi-nating agency through the Intelligence Support Office.  If permission is granted, each copy shall be con-trolled in the same manner as the original.    c.  The contractor must not destroy any intelligence material without advance approval or as specified by the contract monitor (CM).  (EXCEPTION:  Classified waste shall be destroyed as soon as practicable in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Security Program).56    d.  The contractor must restrict access to only those individuals who possess the necessary security clearance and who are actually providing services under the contract with a valid need to know.  Further dissemination to other contractors, subcontractors, other government agencies, private individuals or organizations is prohibited unless authorized in writing by the originating agency through the CM.    e.  The contractor must ensure each employee having access to intelligence material is fully aware of the special security requirements for this material and shall maintain records in a manner that will permit the contractor to furnish, on demand, the names of individuals who have had access to this material in their custody.    f.  Intelligence material must not be released to foreign nationals or immigrant aliens whether they are consultants, US contractors, or employees of the contractor and regardless of the level of their security clearance, except with advance written permission from the originator.  Requests for release to foreign nationals shall be initially forwarded to the contract monitor and shall include:      (1) A copy of the proposed disclosure.      (2) Full justification reflecting the benefits to US interests.      (3) Name, nationality, particulars of clearance, and current access authorization of each proposed for-eign national recipient.    g.  Upon completion or termination of the classified contract, or sooner when the purpose of the release has been served, the contractor will return all classified intelligence (furnished or generated) to the source from which received unless retention or other disposition instructions (see AFMAN 37-139) are autho-rized in writing by the CM.    h.  The contractor must designate an individual who is working on the contract as custodian.  The des-ignated custodian shall be responsible for receipting and accounting for all classified intelligence material received under this contract.  This does not mean that the custodian must personally sign for all classified material.  The inner wrapper of all classified material dispatched should be marked for the attention of a designated custodian and must not be opened by anyone not working directly on the contract.57    i.  Within 30 days after the final product is received and accepted by the procuring agency, classified intelligence materials released to or generated by the contractor, must be returned to the originating agency through the contract monitor unless written instructions authorizing destruction or retention are issued.  Requests to retain material shall be directed to the CM for this contract in writing and must clearly indicate the justification for retention and identity of the specific document to be retained.    j.  Classification, regrading, or declassification markings of documentation produced by the contractor shall be consistent with that applied to the information or documentation from which the new document was prepared.  If a compilation of information or a complete analysis of a subject appears to require a security classification other than that of the source documentation, the contractor shall assign the tentative security classification and request instructions from the contract monitor.  Pending final determination, the material shall be safeguarded as required for its assigned or proposed classification, whichever is higher, until the classification is changed or otherwise verified.2.  Intelligence material carries special markings.  The following is a list of the authorized control mark-ings of intelligence material:    a.  "Dissemination and Extraction of Information Controlled by Originator (ORCON)."  This marking is used, with a security classification, to enable a continuing knowledge and supervision by the originator of the use made of the information involved.  This marking may be used on intelligence which clearly identifies, or would reasonably permit ready identification of an intelligence source or method which is particularly susceptible to countermeasures that would nullify or measurably reduce its effectiveness.  This marking may not be used when an item or information will reasonably be protected by use of other markings specified herein, or by the application of the "need-to-know" principle and the safeguarding procedures of the security classification system.    b.  "Authorized for Release to (Name of Country(ies)/International Organization."  The above is abbre-viated "REL ________."  This marking must be used when it is necessary to identify classified intelli-gence material the US government originator has predetermined to be releasable or has been released through established foreign disclosure channels to the indicated country(ies) or organization.3.  The following procedures govern the use of control markings.58    a.  Any recipient desiring to use intelligence in a manner contrary to restrictions established by the con-trol marking set forth above shall obtain the advance permission of the originating agency through the CM.  Such permission applies only to the specific purposes agreed to by the originator and does not auto-matically apply to all recipients.  Originators shall ensure that prompt consideration is given to recipients’ requests in these regards, with particular attention to reviewing and editing, if necessary, sanitized or paraphrased versions to derive a text suitable for release subject to lesser or no control markings.    b.  The control marking authorized above shall be shown on the title page, front cover, and other appli-cable pages of documents, incorporated in the text of electrical communications, shown on graphics, and associated (in full or abbreviated form) with data stored or processed in automatic data processing sys-tems.  The control marking also shall be indicated by parenthetical use of the marking abbreviations at the beginning or end of the appropriate portions.  If the control marking applies to several or all portions, the document must be marked with a statement to this effect rather than marking each portion individually.    c.  The control markings shall be individually assigned at the time of preparation of intelligence prod-ucts and used in conjunction with security classifications and other marking specified by E.O. 12958 and its implementing security directives.  The marking shall be carried forward to any new format in which the same information is incorporated including oral and visual presentations.4.  Request for release of intelligence material to a contractor must be prepared by the contract monitor (CM) and submitted to the Intelligence Support Office.  This should be accomplished as soon as possible after the contract has been awarded.  The request will be prepared and accompanied with a letter explain-ing the requirements and copies of the DD Form 254 and Statement of Work.Figure 9.3.

The request will be prepared and accompanied with a letter explain-ing the requirement and copies of the DD Form 254 and Statement of Work.9.2. Visit Group Security Agreement (VGSA):9.2.1. DoD security policy does not specifically provide direction on visitor groups.  However, allsecurity requirements contractually imposed on a contractor are legally binding and as such, appropri-ate language (contract security requirements clause) should be inserted into agreements which estab-lish visitor groups and ultimately drives the Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA).  (Seerecommended security clause verbiage at paragraph 9.2.5.1.1.)9.2.2. The Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA) is a documented and legally binding contrac-tual agreement between an Air Force activity and a DoD contractor, whereby the contractor commitsto rendering or performing specific security services for compensation.  The VGSA attests to and cer-tifies the existence of such an agreement, including applicable changes, and amendments, attach-ments, supplements and exhibits.9.2.3. The VGSA is customized to suit the operational needs of the AF activity and the installation.The VGSA provides operational efficiency and  flexibility.9.2.4. The VGSA may be used to impose negotiated contractual security requirements upon the con-tractor.  Like the DD Form 254, the VGSA must be coordinated with those security discipline OPRsand other AF entity that imposes requirements on the contractor via the agreement.9.2.5. The VGSA may be used to specify security requirements and/or to provide security classifica-tion guidance in support of on-base classified work efforts.9.2.5.1. When visitor group security agreements are contemplated, include the clause at AFFARS5352.204.9011 in solicitations and contracts.Figure 9.4. Sample Visitor Group Security Agreement (DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401 Specific).                         VISITOR GROUP SECURITY AGREEMENT621.
