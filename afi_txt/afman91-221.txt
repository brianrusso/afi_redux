General. 1.1.1.  This  manual,  in  conjunction  with  AFI  91-204,  Safety  Investigation  and  Reports, provides  guidance  for  investigating  and  reporting  weapons  mishaps.    The  sole  purpose  of these safety investigations is to prevent future mishaps.  Investigations to gather evidence for claims, litigation, disciplinary, and adverse administrative actions, and for all purposes other than mishap prevention are not covered by this manual. 1.1.1.1.  Nuclear Accidents and Incidents. 1.1.1.2.  Nuclear  accidents  and  incidents  will  be  reported  using  flagwords  only (BROKEN ARROW, BENT SPEAR).  There is no associated mishap class (i.e. A, B, C, D) with a BROKEN ARROW or BENT SPEAR mishap report. 1.1.1.3.  When investigating BENT SPEAR or BROKEN ARROW events follow Class A mishap  procedures  for  board  composition,  mishap  reporting  timelines  and  investigation procedures in accordance with this manual and AFI 91-204. 1.1.2.  Weapons mishaps will be reported and classified in accordance with AFI 91-204 Class A,  B,  C,  D,  and  E  criteria.    Directed  Energy  Weapons  (DEW)  mishaps  will  comply  with additional reporting and classification requirements directed by AFI 91-401, Directed Energy Weapons Safety. 1.2.  Mishap Category. 1.2.1.  Reference  Figure  1.1  to  determine  if  the  mishap  should  be  reported  in  accordance with this manual. 1.3.  Mishap Severity Classification. 1.3.1.  Once it is determined that a non-nuclear mishap is reportable, classify mishap by total direct mishap cost and the severity of injury/occupational illness. 1.3.2.  When  determining  the  mishap  severity  classification  for  nuclear  mishaps,  be  sure  to reference the appropriate security classification guide and mark the report appropriately. 1.3.3.  Reference paragraph 1.4 for criteria requiring flagword reporting of a nuclear accident or incident. 1.4.  Flagwords. 1.4.1.  Flagwords  are  used  to  identify  nuclear  accidents  (e.g.,  BROKEN  ARROW)  and nuclear incidents (e.g., BENT SPEAR).  Flagword definitions may be subjective and it is up to the investigator to determine the best flagword to describe the mishap.  If the event status changes  after  submitting  an  original  report,  submit  another  report  using  the  new  flagword.  Upgrade the flagword only when time-critical responses are required.  Do NOT downgrade the flagword of nuclear mishap reports without the concurrence of AFSEC/SEW.  Additional flagwords  are  contained  in  AFI  10-206,  Operational  Reporting;  cross-reference  with  this guidance to ensure you are reporting the correct flagword. AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015   5  1.4.1.1.

Reports will include the applicable human factor code(s) in latest version of the DoD  Human  Factors  Analysis  and  Classification  System  (HFACS)  as  described  in  AFI 91-204, Attachment 6. 1.5.2.3.  DULL  SWORD  reports  are  used  to  identify  deficiencies  through  crosstell communication  and/or  trend  analysis  to  enhance  nuclear  surety  by  identifying  the potential for a nuclear mishap. 1.5.2.4.  AFSEC/SEW  will  prepare  a  quarterly  informational  summary  of  deficiencies and identified trends.  The summary will be posted to the AFSAS website for access. 1.6.  Mishap Costs. 1.6.1.  Use  the  guidance  in  AFI  91-204  with  the  following  additions  to  determine  mishap costs for mishap classification. 1.6.2.  Dropped Weapons.  For weapons or their components dropped a distance that exceeds the drop criteria in the specific item technical order, estimate the mishap cost at 15 percent of the item replacement cost in the current stock catalog for initial mishap class determination.  Upgrade  or  downgrade  the  mishap  class,  and  report  all  changes  when  actual  cost  is determined.  Upgrade or downgrade after completion of final evaluation. 1.6.3.  Prelaunch Damage.  Compute all ground-launch weapon prelaunch damage occurring without the weapon being launched, to include transportation and storage cost. 1.6.4.  Unintentional  Functioning.    If  the  weapon  or  explosives  functioned  unintentionally (e.g.,  a  bomb  exploded),  include  the  cost  of  the  item  (not  including  intentionally  jettisoned items). 1.6.5.  Intentional Functioning.  If a weapon or explosive was intentionally functioned, do not include  the  cost  of  the  item.  For  test  missions  where  recovery  was  expected,  but  not accomplished,  include  the  cost  of  these  items  to  determine  classification,  unless  test objectives were met or the risk of non-recovery had been anticipated and accepted. 1.6.6.  Parachute-recovered  Weapons. the  repair/replacement  costs  of  all components where recovery was expected, but not accomplished, related to abnormal events   Include AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015   11  or  clearly  excessive  damage.    Abnormal  events  include  torn  parachutes,  late  recovery initiation,  failure  of  a  parachute  to  blossom  or  release,  high  winds,  etc.    Excessive  damage includes buckling of the main fuselage, fire at impact, destruction of the payload section, etc.  The cost of expected damage to parachute-recovered weapons resulting solely from surface impact  during  an  otherwise  normal  recovery  sequence  is  an  operational  expense  and  not reportable.  Do not  include cost of recovery since recovery is  normally a mission  objective for recoverable weapons.   12  AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015 Figure 1.1.

The non-AF members will actively participate  in  the  investigation  and aid  in  report preparation under the  provisions  of AF 91-series  guidance.  The  CA  determines  whether  they  are  accorded  primary  member status  in  accordance  with  any  inter-service  agreements.  Depending  upon  the  extent  of involvement, other services may provide a qualified investigator to serve as an assistant Investigating Officer on the SIB. 5.2.2.14.  Additional  Representatives.    Include  additional  representatives  from  other federal agencies to serve as advisors or consults, if appropriate. 5.2.3.  Secondary Members. Secondary Members assist the SIB in mishap investigation and reporting.  The  BP  determines  the  extent  of  their  participation.  They  are  not  authorized  to submit  a  minority  report  and  do  not  sign  the  Authentication  Page  of  the  Tab  T.  Any additional  member  subordinate  to  a  Primary  Member  will  be  designated  as  a  Secondary Member  and  will  not  be  a  Primary  Member  (i.e.,  if  there  are  two  Technical  Engineering members, one will be primary and one will be secondary). If the BP determines a conditional primary member’s area of expertise is not a factor in the mishap but that member’s expertise is still needed, then this member serves as a Secondary Member. 5.2.3.1.  Recorder.    An  officer  or  NCO  familiar  with  administrative  procedures  and experienced  in  the  use  of  typical  office  computer  software.

These  members  can  be  from  various  technical backgrounds  and  training  levels  to  include  contractor  safety/technical  personnel.  If  a Technical  Engineering  Member  is  appointed,  he  or  she  is  the  lead  for  the  Technical Assistance Members. 5.2.3.4.  Commander’s  Representative.  The  SIB  BP  may  request  a  representative  from the commander whose assets were involved in the mishap, subject to CA approval. The commander  who  owns  those  assets  may  also  request  to  have  a  representative  on  the   20  AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015 board. The Commander’s Representative’s role is limited to providing basic information to the SIB regarding operational and organizational details and practices to help the SIB determine  who  to  interview,  mishap  organization  hierarchy,  etc.  This  individual  is considered  the  expert  on  local  procedures,  local  command  relationships,  organizational structure,  and  unit  personalities.  The  presence  of  the  Commander's  Representative  on  a SIB  will  not  substitute  for  interviews  with  mishap  principals.  The  Commander’s Representative  is  strictly  prohibited  from  providing  any  information  regarding  the  SIB investigation  to  anyone  outside  the  SIB,  including  his/her  commander  or  chain  of command. 5.2.3.5.

MISHAP MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS Class A Board President / Single Investigation Officer (see note 1) AFSEC Representative Investigating Officer Weapon Operations Officer Maintenance Member Medical Officer (see note 2) Technical Expert on item involved Other members as required (see note 3) Class B Board President / Single Investigation Officer (see note 1) Investigating Officer Other members as required (see note 3) Class C, D and  E Single Investigation Officer Notes: 1. Investigation can be conducted using a SIB or SIO.  2. Required when investigation involves a fatality, otherwise the requirement is optional.  3. For mishaps that involve certain focus areas (e.g., human factors, CFR, PO engineering control), assign primary members experienced/qualified in that focus area in order to thoroughly investigate the mishap. 5.4.  Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) Mishaps. 5.4.1.  Mishaps  involving  weapon  test  articles  undergoing  Operational  Test  and  Evaluation (OT&E)  will  be  reported  per  this  manual.    If  test  objectives  were  met,  a  mishap  report  is NOT  required.    Test  mishaps  may  be  investigated  using  a  SIB,  a  Launch  Analysis  Group (LAG) or an Air-Launched Missile Analysis Group (ALMAG).  ALMAG investigations will be  handled  in  accordance  with  AFI  99-151,  Air-Launched  Munitions  Analysis  Group.  However,  the  report  class  will  be  determined  in  accordance  with  AFI  91-204  classification guidance for the direct cost of the loss incurred. 5.4.1.1.  The CA will determine if OT&E mishaps may be reported via LAG or ALMAG based upon the following: 5.4.1.2.  The weapon, reflected energy, or its debris does not impact outside the predicted impact limit parameters. 5.4.1.3.  The mishap does not result in collateral (secondary and unintended) damage or injury. 5.4.1.4.  The  responsible  agency  fully  investigates  the  mishap  to  determine  causes  and recommended corrective actions. 5.4.1.5.  The CA does not have a reason to believe that there is a conflict of interest with the ALMAG or LAG conducting the investigation. AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015   23  5.4.2.  The  ALMAG/LAG  report  may  replace  the  formal  safety  investigation  report; however, all safety message reports (per Table A3.1) are required.  Classify mishaps per AFI 91-204. 5.4.3.  The  ALMAG/LAG  investigators  may  not  offer  promises  of  confidentiality.    If confidentiality is required to determine the cause(s) of a mishap, a safety investigation board must be convened under AFI 91-204 and a safety investigation report issued. 5.5.  Obtaining and Using Technical Assistance. 5.5.1.  If  technical  assistance  is  required  to  conduct  the  safety  investigation,  follow  these procedures: 5.5.2.  The  SIB  should  request  technical  assistance  through  the  CA.    The  CA  then  contacts AFSEC/SEW who will answer directly to the SIB.   24  AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 6 REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS 6.1.  General. 6.1.1.  In  addition  to  the  requirements  of  this  chapter,  nuclear  accidents,  incidents,  and deficiencies will require the submission of a nuclear flagword report.  Follow guidance listed in AFI 91-204, with the following additions. 6.1.2.  Report submission schedule.  Use Table A3.1 through Table A3.3  Reports required by these tables are in addition to OPREP-3 reports required by AFI 10-206. (T-1). 6.1.3.  When weapons involved in a mishap are common to other services, such as in Table A3.4, ensure other service safety agencies are notified. (T-1). 6.1.4.  Use the following examples for writing subject line of weapons reports, or if AFSAS cannot be accessed: 6.1.4.1.  CLASS B, GUIDED MISSILE, 19980307ZQKL003B. 6.1.4.2.  CLASS  C,  EXPLOSIVES  AND  CHEMICAL  AGENTS,  EXPLOSIVE, 19991225ZQKL123C. 6.1.4.3.  CLASS  D,  EXPLOSIVES  AND  CHEMICAL  AGENTS,  EXPLOSIVE, 19981122ZQKL005D. 6.1.4.4.  CLASS E, NUCLEAR, NUCLEAR WEAPON, 19990927FTFA005E. 6.1.5.  Reports will be closed by the originator. (T-1). 6.2.  Multiple Categories. 6.2.1.  When reporting multiple categories, refer to appropriate manuals that implement AFI 91-204 to provide all required information, and include necessary addressees in the reports. 6.2.2.  The  objectives  for  reporting  weapons  deficiencies  are  to  prevent  accidents  and incidents,  minimize  their  effects  if  they  should  occur,  and  reduce  the  occurrence  of  safety deficiencies.    The  requirement  for  reporting  nuclear  weapon  system  safety  deficiencies supports  the  objectives  of  AFI  91-101,  Air  Force  Nuclear  Weapons  Surety  Program.    The requirements for reporting radiological safety deficiencies support the objectives of AFI 40-201. 6.2.3.  While  the  results  of  safety  investigations  play  a  direct  role  in  the  mishap  prevention process,  the  indiscriminate  use  of  statistical  comparisons  between  units  can  jeopardize accurate  reporting  and  are  inappropriate  due  to  the  rare  nature  of  mishaps.    Do  NOT  make statistical comparisons of different commands or units using mishap reports as a source. (T-1). 6.2.4.  Because the criteria for the submission of safety deficiency reports (DR) are so broad, comparing nuclear safety statistics between commands and operating units may NOT provide accurate  trend  information  for  managerial  analysis.    Use  safety  deficiency  reports  only  to   Do  NOT  publish  statistical identify  potential  problems  and  corrective  measures. AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015   25  comparisons of different commands or units using safety deficiency reports as a source. (T-1). 6.3.  Preparing reports for weapons mishaps. 6.3.1.  Safety reporting will be through the AFSAS website.  If AFSAS is not available, units will report in accordance with AFI 91-204, paragraph 3.6. (T-1). 6.3.1.1.  For  nuclear deficiencies are reported in AFSAS. (T-1). investigations,  only  unclassified  DULL  SWORD  nuclear 6.3.1.2.  Nuclear  flagword  reports  will  be  submitted  via  SECRET  Internet  Protocol Network (SIPRNet) or other secure means. (T-1). 6.3.2.  MAJCOMs  may  supplement  their  addressees  to  include,  any  internal  organizations with  a  need-to-know.  They  may  use  Addressee  Indicator  Groups  (AIG)  to  add  addressees, within  the  command,  as  recipients  of  selected  safety  reports.    Do  not  include  addressees outside of MAJCOM AIG listings. 6.3.2.1.  Do not use an address list (AL) for reports that contain little or no information of worldwide  mishap  prevention  potential.    Use  routine  handling  procedures  for  AL addressees. 6.3.3.  Send reports conveying significant safety information peculiar to the nuclear weapon system to other Air Force MAJCOMs possessing like systems. 6.4.  Preliminary Message. 6.4.1.  Follow  guidance in  AFI  91-204  for  transmitting  preliminary  messages.   For Class  A and B on-duty mishaps, send a fully releasable preliminary message within 24 hours (Table A3.1). 6.4.2.  Include  a  narrative  description  of  what  happened  (but  not  why),  stating  the  best  and most complete information available in simple and direct terms.  Do not delay the report for lack of information.  If complete data is not available, provide it in a status report. 6.5.  10-Day Message: 6.5.1.  Follow  guidance  in  AFI  91-204.    Use  this  message  to  relay  new  information discovered since the preliminary message and to identify the investigating officer (by name, grade, organization, and position). 6.6.  Status Message: 6.6.1.  Follow guidance in AFI 91-204.  Status messages may be sent at any time to update information  prior  to  final  message  when  awaiting  results  from  deficiency  reports,  analyses, toxicology  (TOX)  tests,  etc.    The  purpose  is  to  relay  the  status  of  the  mishap  investigation and  any  new  information  discovered  since  the  initial  status  report.    Findings,  causes,  and recommendations may be made in a status report, if a delay is anticipated in receiving results, but  the investigator believes  that enough information is  available to  reach a conclusion.  In this  case,  issue  a  status  report  no  later  than  30  days  after  the  mishap  with  as  much information as is known.  Publish a final message when the results are known and revise the status report’s findings, causes, and recommendations, if required.   26  AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015 6.6.2.  If new information is found and the information makes significant changes to the final message, send a message updating findings, causes, or recommendations. 6.7.  Final Message. 6.7.1.  Follow  guidance  in  AFI  91-204.    Complete  the  investigation  and  prepare  the  final message within the specified time limits.  The CA will release the final message, unless this responsibility is delegated to the SIB or single investigator. 6.7.2.  The principles for writing the narrative portion of the final message are the same as for the formal report below. 6.8.  High Accident Potential (HAP) Reports. 6.8.1.  HAP  reports  provide  information  on  events  and  trends  that  did  not  cause  damage, injury, or death, but have the potential to do so.  HAP reports are Class E events that do not have a dollar cost. 6.8.2.  If  a  HAP  event  involves  materiel  failure,  malfunction,  or  design  deficiency,  the Program  Manager  (PM)  forwards  corrective  action  taken  or  contemplated  to  AFSEC/SEW, Air  Force  Materiel  Command  (AFMC)  Chief  of  Safety  (AFMC/SE),  and  the  investigating MAJCOM by message within 60 days following the date of the associated deficiency report or  combined  mishap  deficiency  report.    Replies  to  deficiency  reports  by  the  agency  with engineering responsibility suffice for the Air Logistics Complex (ALC) action message if the HAP’s mishap event number is included. 6.9.  Formal Reports. 6.9.1.  All privileged safety formal reports have three parts:  Part 1, Factual Information and Releasable  Material,  Part  2,  Board  Conclusions  and  Non-Releasable  Material,  and  Part  3, Other  Material.    Follow-up  actions  will  be  placed  in  supplemental  Status  Messages  as required by para 6.5.2. 6.9.2.  Authenticating Formal Reports.  Type each primary SIB member’s name, grade, and position  on  the  last  page  of  the  tab  containing  board  analysis  and  conclusions.    Have  each concurring member, including primary members from other services on Joint Investigations, sign above it for authentication of the report or for any changes to the report.  If the formal SIB  report  needs  to  be  changed  after  it  is  completed  and  signed  by  the  board,  all  primary members of the SIB shall be physically reconvened. 6.9.3.  Controlling  the  Formal  Report.    Once  the  SIB  completes  the  investigation  and finalizes  the  hard  copy  report,  the  SIB  will  send  all  copies  of  the  formal  report  to  the  CA.  The CA safety office will control all hard copies of the report until the CA is briefed on the results  of  the  investigation.    Upon  approval  for  release,  the  MAJCOM  safety  office  will control the distribution of the report.  MAJCOMs may set up different procedures to speed up the distribution process.  Publish these procedures in the MAJCOM Supplement. 6.9.4.  Forwarding Formal Reports. 6.9.4.1.  The  memorandum  of  transmittal  (see  Figure  A2.1)  will  list  all  addressees receiving copies of (or extracts from or attachments to) the report.  Number and account for all copies of privileged reports by listing each addressee, including office symbol and copy  number,  in  the  “Distribution  List”  attachment  to  the  memorandum  of  transmittal AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015   27  (for  example,  ACC/SE,  Harbor  Center,  2  Eaton  Street,  Suite  402,  Hampton  VA  23669, copy  4  of  20).    The  memorandum  of  transmittal  goes  before  all  Tabs  in  Part  1  of  the report.  Include a statement signed by the SIB president, certifying the number of copies of the report listed are the only copies of the SIB report produced. 6.9.4.2.  Distribution of privileged reports is restricted to those with a need to know in the Air Force or Unified Commands.  Do not provide copies or extracts to agencies outside the Air Force.  If an agency outside the Air Force needs a copy of the formal report for corrective actions or has statutory jurisdiction, request authorization from AFSEC Judge Advocate  (AFSEC/JA)  by  message  or  memorandum  before  sending  copies  to  these organizations. 6.9.4.3.  AFSEC  or  MAJCOMs  may  require  additional  copies  to  be  sent  to  their headquarters to  aid  in staffing the report.   After completing the command endorsement, MAJCOMs must destroy all but the file copy. 6.9.4.4.  Send  copies  of  the  formal  report  to  all  Air  Force  agencies  or  organizations tasked in the recommendations.  If investigators conclude action needs to be taken by an agency  outside  the  CA’s  command,  but  cannot  specifically  identify  where  it  must  be accomplished, the CA’s safety office will: 6.9.4.4.1.  Locate the responsible agency and provide the investigating officer with a point of contact, or 6.9.4.4.2.  Accept  initial  responsibility  for  the  action  by  being  tasked  as  OPR  in  the formal report.  In this case, the CA’s safety office should ensure an extra copy of the formal  report  is  prepared  and  available  for  forwarding  when  the  appropriate  action agency and point of contact are determined. 6.9.4.5.  If  a  Secretariat  level  or  Air  Staff  office  is  the  action  agency  for  a  validated recommendation,  the  MAJCOM  safety  office  will  forward  a  copy  of  the  report  to  that agency  and  an  informational  copy  to  the  Issues  Division,  Office  of  the  Chief  of  Safety (AF/SEI).    MAJCOM  safety  offices  will  also  forward  reports  directly  to  Forward Operating Agencies (FOAs) or Direct Reporting Units (DRUs). 6.9.4.6.  AFSEC  may  request  extra  copies  of  reports  for  distribution  to  other  agencies.  Send these copies to AFSEC/JA, who will provide them to the proper agency. 6.9.4.7.  Do not produce “information only” copies of formal reports. 6.9.4.8.  The SIB president may keep a complete copy of the formal report (for briefing purposes) for 60 days.  List this copy on the memorandum of transmittal and return it to the MAJCOM safety office for disposition. 6.9.4.9.  The  CA  may  retain  reports  according  to  AFI  33-364,  Records  Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities.  AFSEC/JA must approve retention of these reports for other than the CA. 6.9.4.9.1.  Wing-level  units  or  below  destroy  formal  reports  upon  receipt  of  the Memorandum  of  Final  Evaluation  (MOFE)  or  Letter  of  Administrative  Closure (LOAC). (T-1).   28  AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015 6.9.4.9.2.  Numbered Air Forces (NAF) and above destroy formal reports upon final close-out  of  recommendations  and  when  no  longer  needed  for  mishap  prevention purposes. 6.10.  Classified Safety Reporting. 6.10.1.  Classified reports will follow unclassified report schedules and will be submitted via SIPRNet to AFSEC/SEW (AFSC.SEW@afmc.af.smil.mil). (T-1). 6.10.2.  Format  templates  for  classified  messages  and  reports  are  available  via  SIPRNet  at http://intelshare.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afsec/SEWN/SitePages/Home.aspx (AFSEC/SEW’s  SIPR  sharepoint®  site).    Submit  access  requests  via  email  to  HQ AFSEC/SEWN.  Requests must include users name, organization and justification for access. 6.10.3.  Ensure  all  classified  messages  and  reports  are  properly  marked  in  accordance  with AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. 6.10.4.  Classified safety reports will be available for, or distributed to appropriate agencies for review and implementation of corrective actions. 6.10.4.1.  The CA has responsibility to distribute the formal safety report.  Formal safety reports  will  be  distributed to  AF/SE,  AF/A3/A4/A10,  AFSEC/SEW,  affected MAJCOM/CC  and  the  United  States  Strategic  Command  (USSTRATCOM)  Command Center, at a minimum.  Contact AFSEC/SEW for additional agencies requiring a copy of the formal safety report. 6.10.4.2.  Classified  DULL  SWORD  reports  are  available  via  AFSEC/SEW’s  SIPR sharepoint® site.  Create a report number in  AFSAS as a placeholder for any classified DULL SWORD report. 6.11.  Assembling Formal Mishap Reports. 6.11.1.  Prepare  formal  reports  according  to  this  instruction  and  AFI  91-204.    Additional guidance  on  report  format  and  access  to  report  templates  are  available  in  AFSAS  under “Pubs and Refs”. 6.11.2.  With the exception of nuclear flagword reports, the formal report will be assembled from various tabs that the SIB or SIO uploads into AFSAS.  Each tab will be a single .pdf file containing all the information for that tab.  Exceptions to the single .pdf file format are: 6.11.2.1.  Tab L, as it may contain digital data files. 6.11.2.2.  Tab  S  (non-privileged)  and  Tab  X  (privileged),  as  they  may  contain  pertinent videos and/or final versions of animations. 6.11.2.3.  Tab U, as it will contain the complete audio/video files for pertinent interviews that are partially transcribed. 6.11.3.  Prepare formal reports according to this instruction and AFI 91-204, use continuation pages, if needed. 6.11.4.  Ensure documents are marked with appropriate warnings in accordance with AFI 91-204. AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015   29  6.11.4.1.

The Maintenance Member completes this tab. 6.12.10.  TAB J:  Releasable Technical Reports and Engineering Evaluations. 6.12.10.1.  Reports  in  this  tab  are  factual  and  should  detail  observations  (what  parts  are bent, broken, or burned, etc.), analysis (how it happened, and whether it happened before, during,  or  after  the  mishap),  conclusions  (effect  on  system  function,  etc.),  and recommendations  (methods  to  prevent  the  observed  condition  from  re-occurring,  etc.). Analysis,  conclusions,  and  recommendations  will  be  based  on  physical  evidence,  other factual data, and statements made without a promise of confidentiality. 6.12.10.1.1.  Written  reports  and  on-scene  evaluations  submitted  by  DoD  personnel will  be  included  in  this  tab.    Do  not  provide  a  promise  of  confidentiality  to  DoD personnel,  but  obtain  their  signature  on  the  Safety  Investigation  Non-Disclosure Agreement (AFI 91-204 Attachment 3) which is kept on file with the SIB. 6.12.10.1.2.  Factual  reports  or  information  provided  by  a  contractor,  which  the contractor’s  representative  has  determined  does  not  require  the  promise  of confidentiality, are placed in this tab. The SIB will ensure they sign the Memorandum for Contractor Representatives Serving as Technical Experts to Safety Investigations (AFI 91-204 Attachment 3) and it is on file with the SIB. 6.12.10.1.3.  SIBs/SIOs  should  make  every  effort  to  have  their  technical  experts (government or contractor) write a non-privileged report for Tab J. Technical experts are  often  included in  all  SIB  proceedings and have  access  or  exposure  to  privileged AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015   31  information  during  the  investigation;  therefore,  SIBs/SIOs  must  thoroughly  review Tab  J  reports  to  ensure  they  do  not  contain  and  are  not  based  upon  privileged information. 6.12.10.2.  Analysis that includes or was based on privileged information (e.g., privileged witness  testimony,  board  deliberations)  or  includes  speculative  opinion  of  the  mishap cause by the technical expert is considered privileged and will be placed as an addendum in Tab W. The SIB will determine what caused the mishap, and that will appear in Tab T. 6.12.10.3.  The Investigating Officer and Maintenance Member completes this tab. 6.12.11.  TAB K:  Mission Records and Data. 6.12.11.1.  Include  all  mission  records,  data,  forms  and  work  orders  associated  with  the mishap item. 6.12.11.2.

Work  through  the  CA  Safety  office  for  contact information. The AIB will be responsible for final disposition of all material released to them by the SIB. 6.12.17.5.  The Investigating Officer and Recorder completes this tab. 6.12.18.  TAB R: Releasable Witness Testimony. 6.12.18.1.  Place  testimony  from  individuals  and  witnesses  that  were  not  granted  a promise of confidentiality in this tab. Pertinent recorded interviews placed in this tab will be completely transcribed verbatim. Do not include audio recordings in this tab. 6.12.18.1.1.  For non-privileged interviews, whether written or recorded, all witnesses sign  the  form  from  AFI  91-204  Attachment  3,  Non-Privileged  Witness  Statement. This only needs to be accomplished once for recorded interviews, but must be done for ALL written statements whether it be initial or subsequent follow-up. 6.12.18.1.2.  For  recorded  interviews,  ensure  all  interviewees  are  read  the  Notice  to Witness that Recorded Statement is not Confidential, AFI 91-204 Attachment 3, and it is recorded and transcribed. This must be done for ALL recorded interviews whether it be initial or subsequent follow-up. 6.12.18.1.3.  It is not necessary to transcribe or publish all testimony. If the testimony does not provide any insight into the mishap, do not include it in this tab, but provide it  to  the  AIB.  Place  the  statements  and  transcribed  interviews  from  applicable witnesses  together  in  chronological  order  starting  with  the  first  accomplished.  The mishap participants are placed first followed by other witnesses. 6.12.18.1.4.  Reference  AFI  91-204,  Figure  A3.3  for  a  non-privileged  witness statements. 6.12.18.2.

Do  not  include  photographs  of  deceased  personnel  or  unnecessary evidence  of  human  injury  (e.g.,  bloody  vehicle  parts)  in  the  safety  report.  These photographs may be included in Tab Y if they support findings or recommendations. Medical pictures can be given to the AIB. If the SIB absolutely needs to disseminate an injury photo to illustrate the mishap, consider using a black and white photo if it will meet the needs of the investigation. 6.12.19.1.3.  Label  each  image  to  aid  reviewers;  however,  do  not  refer  to  privileged safety  information  on  the  page  captions  or  in  comments  on  an  index.    When investigators include privileged safety information on a transparent overlay, place the photograph with the overlay in Tab T and the photograph without the overlay in Tab S. 6.12.19.1.4.  Staged  photographs  (e.g.,  pictures  of  models  showing  flight  paths  in  a midair  collision,  assembling  or  reconstructing  damaged  parts  or  aligning  parts  to show fire patterns or impact marks, or depictions of cockpit indications for a given set of  assumptions  made  by  the  SIB  or  described  in  witness  testimony)  are  considered privileged  if  they  are  staged  for  the  board’s  analysis  and  will  be  placed  at  Tab  X.  Pointing  with  a  finger  or  other  device  at  a  portion  of  wreckage  does  not  make  the photograph staged. 6.12.19.2.  Releasable Videos. 6.12.19.2.1.  Releasable videos. Only upload non-privileged videos (e.g., videos shot by  eye  witnesses,  etc.)  relevant  to  the  investigation  (in  accordance  with  paragraph 6.11.2)  and  make  a  reference  in  Tab  S.

TAB T:  Investigation, Analysis and Conclusions.  This section comprises the most important part of the report; therefore, information in this tab should draw from all portions of  the  report  to  not  only  provide  a  complete  picture  of  what  happened,  but  also  provide  a thorough  analysis  of  all  evidence  and  the  findings,  causes,  and  recommendations.    This section also records the opinions of the SIB, and it either accepts or rejects all scenarios or theories  in  the  report.    Only  in  the  case  of  a  minority  report  are  there  differing  findings, causes, or recommendations.  Human Factor recommendations related to causal findings will be included with  the other SIB recommendations.   Place all privileged status  messages  and the  final  Consolidated  Mishap  Report  (CMR)  in  this  Tab.  The  Investigating  Officer,  with contributions from all applicable SIB members, is responsible to complete this tab. Reference AFI 91-204, Chapter 5 for additional guidance for completing this tab. The layout should be as follows: 6.13.1.1.  (T1)  Glossary of Terms and Acronyms. 6.13.1.2.  (T2)  Mishap Overview. 6.13.1.2.1.  (T2.1)  History  of  Mishap.  The  section  is  a  narrative  of  the  mishap sequence,  in  chronological  order,  of  all  pertinent  events  from  briefing,  ground operations, maintenance, etc. Times of significant events should be integrated into the write-ups. The history explains what occurred, but not why. 6.13.1.2.2.  (T2.2)  SIB  Conclusions.  This  section  contains  a  brief  summary  of  why the  mishap  occurred.  Think  of  this  as  a  “bottom  line  up  front”  paragraph(s).  This section  does  not  include  detailed  explanations,  as  those  will  be  included  in  the appropriate factors sections of the Tab T. If human factors are issues in the mishap, be sure to include the name of the human factor and nano-code as defined by the DoD HFACS (reference AFI 91-204, Attachment 6). 6.13.1.3.  (T3)  Background  Information.  Provide  background  information  and  facts  on the mishap crewmembers, maintenance personnel, leadership, or others that were factors in the mishap. In addition, detail should provide sufficient background to understand the condition  of  vehicle  or  equipment  to  include  any  significant  events  in  its  design, manufacture, procurement, maintenance, or overhaul. 6.13.1.4.  (T4)  Operations Areas investigated. 6.13.1.4.1.  (T4.1)  Investigative Sources of Data. Explain the sources of data used by the  SIB  to  determine  the  operations factors  in  the  mishap  (e.g.,  interviews,  training, mission preparation, technical assistance provided by contractors). 6.13.1.4.2.  (T4.2)  Description  of  Systems,  Processes,  Organizations.  Describe  in narrative  format  the  normal  operation  of  weapon  systems,  the  process  directly involved in the mishap, or the organizational structures as required. Provide detailed descriptions  unusual  operational  environments  involved  in  the  mishap.  This  section will  contain  enough  detail  so  the  reader  can  understand  the  SIB’s  investigative processes. 6.13.1.4.3.  (T4.3)  Factors.  Analyze  the  factors  that  influenced  the  mishap  or  its outcome. This section is written in narrative format. Each factor will be analyzed in a   36  AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015 separate  write-up.  Topics  presented  should  flow  in  order  from  what  factors  the  SIB considered  most  important  to  least  important  in  contributing  to  the  mishap.  In collaboration  with  the  Medical  Officer  or  Human  Factors  Member  (if  applicable), integrate  DoD  HFACS  nano-codes  without  definitions  and  discuss  the  applicable human factor in this section. Provide a detailed analysis and rationale of how human factors contributed to the factor under discussion. 6.13.1.4.4.  (T4.4)  Non-Factors. 6.13.1.5.  (T5)  Maintenance Areas investigated. Subcategories in this section will mirror those described in paragraph 6.13.1.4. 6.13.1.6.  (T6)  Logistics  Areas  investigated.  Subcategories  in  this  section  will  mirror those described in paragraph 6.13.1.4. 6.13.1.7.  (T7)  Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion (NFWOD). 6.13.1.7.1.  If  an  issue  contributed  to  the  mishap,  even  minimally,  it  is  a  factor  and should not be placed in this section. 6.13.1.7.2.  Group NFWODs together by operations, maintenance, and logistics. 6.13.1.7.3.  In  collaboration  with  the  Medical  Officer  or  Human  Factors  Member  (if applicable),  integrate  DoD  HFACS  nano-codes  without  definitions  and  discuss  the applicable human factor in the this section. Provide a detailed analysis and rationale of how human factors contributed to the NFWOD under discussion. 6.13.1.8.  (T8)  Findings and Causes. 6.13.1.8.1.  This  section  is  a  chronological  list  of  all  the  SIB’s  findings  and  causes. Ensure all findings and causes are supported by the investigation and analysis section. 6.13.1.8.2.  Human factors related causes should include those specific human factors attributed as causal in a “due to” statement. 6.13.1.9.  (T9)  Recommendations. 6.13.1.9.1.  This  section  contains  a  listing  of  the  SIB’s  primary  recommendations. Each  recommendation  must  correspond  to  a  finding.  However,  each  finding  is  not required to have a recommendation. 6.13.1.9.2.  Most causal findings should have recommendations for future prevention or mitigation. 6.13.1.10.  (T10)  Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance (OFS/ORS). 6.13.1.10.1.  Use this section to fully discuss and provide rationale for any OFS and ORS identified. 6.13.1.11.  (T11)  Authentication Page. 6.13.1.11.1.  Type each primary SIB member’s name, rank, and board role on the last page of this section. Have each concurring member, including primary members from other services on joint investigations, sign above their name for authentication of the report or for any changes to the report. AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015   37  6.13.1.11.2.  If  the  formal  SIB  report  needs  to  be  changed  after  it  is  completed  and signed  by  the  board,  all  primary  members  of  the  SIB  will  reconvene.  However,  the CA may allow the SIB to make minor changes without reconvening the board. 6.13.1.12.  (T12)  Minority Reports (if applicable). 6.13.1.12.1.  Primary  members  who  disagree  with  the  results  may  submit  a  separate minority report. Minority reports must include reasons for disagreement in a narrative format  and  will  list  suggested  findings,  causes,  and  recommendations  if  different from those contained in the original report. 6.13.1.12.2.  If  a  SIB  member  submits  a  minority  report,  their  signature  block  still appears  on  the  Tab  T  authentication  page  but  they  do  not  sign  above  it.  Their signature will be on the minority report. 6.13.2.  TAB U: Witness Testimony Provided Under a Promise of Confidentiality. 6.13.2.1.  If testimony was provided under a promise of confidentiality, it will be placed in this tab. Select only meaningful testimony (written or verbal). Only pertinent sections of  interviews  need  be  transcribed.  If  any  interviews  are  only  partially  transcribed,  the audio  file  must  also  be  uploaded  to  this  tab  in  AFSAS.    Reference  AFI  91-204  for guidance pertaining to a promise of confidentiality. 6.13.2.1.1.  A promise of confidentiality may be given to any witness whom the SIB determines  should  be  extended  such  a  promise  for  mishaps  involving  nuclear  or DEW. 6.13.2.1.2.  A promise of confidentiality shall not be given on a blanket basis to every potential witness. 6.13.2.1.3.  The  promise  of  confidentiality  must  be  clearly  understood  by  those witnesses extended the promise, and they must be given the opportunity to waive any confidentiality.  Non-privileged statements will be placed in Tab R. 6.13.2.2.  For  privileged  interviews,  whether  written  or  recorded,  all  witnesses  sign  the form  from  AFI  91-204  Attachment  3,  Witness  Promise  of  Confidentiality  and  Non-Disclosure Agreement. This only needs to be accomplished once for recorded interviews but must be done for ALL written statements whether it be initial or subsequent follow-up. 6.13.2.3.  For recorded interviews, ensure all interviewees are read the Notice to Witness Documenting  Promise  of  Confidentiality  of  Recorded  Statements,  AFI  91-204 Attachment  3,  and  it  is  recorded  and  transcribed.  This  must  be  done  for  all  recorded interviews whether it be initial or subsequent follow-up. 6.13.2.4.  Place  the  statements  and  transcribed  testimony  of  each  witness  together  in chronological  order  starting  with  the  first  accomplished.  The  mishap  participants  are placed first followed by other witnesses. 6.13.2.5.  If  applicable,  place  privileged  72-hour  and  14-day  histories  to  include privileged witness statements in this tab. 6.13.2.6.

poses a hazard to life, health, or property as defined by the criteria in paragraph 1.4.6 Bent  Spear—A  reporting  flagword  identifying  a  nuclear  weapon  incident.    This  includes mishaps not in the accident category but meeting any of the criteria in paragraph 1.4.4 AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015   49  Broken Arrow—A reporting flagword that identifies a nuclear weapon accident that could NOT create the risk of war, but meets any of the criteria in paragraph 1.4.2 Catastrophic—Occurs  when  the  entire  system  or  a  major  portion  of  it  is  inoperative.    For example failure of the annunciation and display subsystem. Dull  Sword—A  reporting  flagword  identifying  a  nuclear  weapon  safety  deficiency.    This includes  mishaps  not  falling  into  the  accident  or  incident  categories,  but  meeting  any  of  the criteria in paragraph 1.5 Empty Quiver—The loss, theft, seizure, or destruction of a nuclear weapon or component.  Loss includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  intentional  weapon  jettisoning  according  to  approved  Air  Force procedures or inadvertent release of a nuclear component. Human Factors—“A body of scientific facts about human characteristics.  The term covers all biomedical  and  psychosocial  considerations;  it  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  principles  and applications  in  the  areas  of  human  engineering,  personnel  selection,  training,  life  support,  job performance aids, and human performance evaluation." Industrial  Weapons  Mishap—Mishaps  occurring  in  the  industrial  environment  that  involve weapons  (i.e.,  nuclear,  guided  missile,  explosives  and  chemical  agents,  or  directed  energy weapons) or associated unique support equipment.  Examples include bomb fin damage during handling or injury to a worker during a MJ-1 bomb lift operation. Limited-Life  Component—A  weapon  component  that  deteriorates  in  some  respect  over  time, and must be replaced periodically during weapon stockpile life: principle classes of limited-life components are reservoirs, neutron generators, radioisotope thermal generators and parachutes. Missile—Systems  that  are  propelled  through  the  air  that  are  unmanned,  guided  by  internal  or external systems, self-propelled, and designed to deliver ordnance to a target or act as a target.  This  definition  includes  training  missiles.  BQM-167  subscale  aerial  targets  and  ADM-160 Miniature  Air-Launched  Decoys  (MALD)  will  be  considered  subscale  Remotely  Piloted Vehicles (RPV) (i.e. Unmanned Aerial System) for mishap categorization purposes. Missile Mishap—Unplanned damage to or functioning of a missile; or damage, illness, or injury caused by a missile; or when the missile fails to complete its intended mission. Nucflash—A reporting flagword that identifies a nuclear weapon accident that could create the risk of war, meeting any of the criteria in paragraph 1.4.1 Nuclear  Components—Major  subassembly  of  a  nuclear  explosive  that  contains  SNM  in quantities  sufficient  to  fuel  a  nuclear  explosion  (e.g.    pit  or  canned  subassembly).    Note  that subassemblies containing tritium are not nuclear components. Nuclear  Surety  (A.K.A.  Nuclear  Weapons  Surety)—Materiel,  personnel,  and  procedures which contribute to the safety, security, and reliability of nuclear weapons and to the assurance that  there will be no nuclear weapon accidents, incidents,  unauthorized weapon detonations,  or degradation in performance at the target. Nuclear  Weapon  System  (A.K.A  Nuclear  System)—A  combat  delivery  vehicle  with  its nuclear  weapon  or  weapons  and  associated  support  equipment,  noncombat  delivery  vehicles, facilities, and services.   50  AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015 Nuclear  Weapon  System  Accident—A  serious  nuclear  weapon  system  mishap  involving  a nuclear weapon. Nuclear  Weapon  System  Incident—A  significant  or  unexpected  event  involving  nuclear weapons, nuclear warheads, or nuclear components not meeting the criteria for an accident. Nuclear Weapon System Mishap—Nuclear accident, incident, and safety deficiency involving nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon systems, and associated equipment and procedures. Nuclear Weapon  System  Safety Deficiency—A situation, event, or condition which could (or did) degrade nuclear surety but did not meet the criteria for an accident or incident. Pinnacle Faded Giant—A reporting flagword used to identify a radiological incident that poses a hazard to life, health, or property as defined by the criteria in paragraph 1.4.5  AFMAN91-221  21 AUGUST 2015   51  Attachment 2 SAMPLE SAFETY MEMORANDUM  Figure A2.1.
