Ensure  they  participate  only  in  ground  and  flying  activities  for  which  they  are qualified, current and prepared or properly supervised. 1.3.  Training:  Crewmember  training  is  designed  to  progress  a  crewmember  from  Initial Qualification  Training  (IQT),  to  Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT)  and  finally  to Continuation Training (CT).  Training limitations times are listed in Table 1.1 (T-2). AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   9  Table 1.1.  Training Time Limitations (Calendar Days).

Training time begins with first significant training event.  (i.e. ground training/flight training.) 2.  Any events not accomplished in MQT and/or waived, should be accomplished by the gaining unit. 3.  Differences training programs should be developed by operational units to train crew members in different systems/tactics within the same aircraft series. 1.3.1.  IQT:   Provides necessary training to initially qualify crewmembers in a basic aircraft position and flying duties without regard to a unit's mission.  IQT is usually accomplished at a  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU).    There  are  provisions  within  this  instruction  to  accomplish IQT in non-FTUs, if the situation necessitates.               Note:  After successful completion of the  qualification  flight  evaluation  (an  element  of  the  IQT  program)  crewmembers  are considered in  Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status.   BAQ is  a temporary qualification and  is  not  specifically  (or  necessarily)  documented,  as  such.  Crewmembers  are  usually documented  as  in  IQT  or  MQT  status  while  in  BAQ  status.    BAQ  is  not  a  long-term qualification  status.    Waiver  authority  for  any  crewmember  to  remain  in  BAQ  status  is ACC/A3. (T-2). 1.3.2.  MQT:  Provides necessary training to initially qualify or re-qualify crewmembers in a specific  position  and  duties  to  perform  the  missions  assigned  to  a  specific  unit.  Crewmembers  maintain  BAQ  status  until  they  complete  MQT.    Following  completion  of IQT  and  MQT  (or  formal  instructor  upgrade  program),  crewmembers  will  have  received training in all the basic missions of a specific unit, unless otherwise stated in  Chapter  3 of this  instruction.  Crewmembers  will  then  be  assigned  to  either  a  Combat  Mission  Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) position.            Note:  Progression from BAQ to CMR/BMC  status  requires  a  Mission  (MSN)  evaluation  IAW  AFI  11-2MC-12WV2,  MC-12W Crew Evaluation Criteria. 1.3.3.  Continuation Training (CT): 1.3.3.1.  CT  is  the  training  program  for  CMR/BMC-designated  crewmembers  and  is designed to maintain a minimum level of proficiency and/or to increase the capability of individual crewmembers.   10  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 1.3.3.1.1.  Combat Mission Ready (CMR): 1.3.3.1.1.1.  CMR requirements. requirements  are typically  more robust than  BMC 1.3.3.1.1.2.  Minimum training required for aircrew to be qualified and proficient in all of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system. 1.3.3.1.1.3.  All  designated  combat  aircraft  (CC-coded)  unit  active  duty  API-1 positions and flying SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR positions.  OG/CCs  may  designate  other  API-6/8  positions  not  assigned  to  the  flying squadron as CMR.  EXCEPTION:  If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to  train  the  front  line  of  their  Unit  Manning  Document  (UMD)  API-1s  to  CMR and designate the overage BMC.  In this case, priority should be given to API-1 inexperienced  crewmembers  and  at  least  50%  of  the  front  line  positions  will  be filled with inexperienced crewmembers, if available (ANG: any crewmember may be designated CMR or BMC at OG/CC discretion). 1.3.3.1.1.4.  CMR crewmembers maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions  of  the  flying  unit  to  which  they  are  assigned  or  attached.    CMR crewmembers must maintain currency in all core designated flight training, sorties and events and all mission ground training which affect CMR status. 1.3.3.1.1.5.  Non-CMR (N-CMR).  Failure to complete CMR training or maintain these currencies results in regression to N-CMR status unless waived by OG/CC.  While N-CMR, pilots may perform missions and events in which they are current and  qualified  at  the  discretion  of  the  SQ/CC.    Crewmembers  that  regress  to  N-CMR status will accomplish the requirements in accordance with paragraph 4.8 and 4.11 1.3.3.1.2.  Basic Mission Capable (BMC): 1.3.3.1.2.1.  The  minimum  training  required  to  be  familiar  with  all  (and  may  be qualified and proficient in some) of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system. 1.3.3.1.2.2.  All  active  duty  wing  crewmember  positions  that  are  not  designated CMR  positions,  are  BMC  positions.    BMC  designations  are  assigned  to crewmembers  that  have  a  primary  job  performing  wing  supervision  or  staff functions that directly support the flying operation.  FTU/ USAF Weapons School (USAFWS) instructors and operational test crewmembers are also assigned BMC status. 1.3.3.1.2.3.  BMC  crewmembers  maintain  familiarization  with  all  unit  core missions.    They  may  also  maintain  proficiency  and  qualification  in  some  of  the unit  core  missions.    For  those  missions  in  which  they  maintain  familiarization only,  BMC crewmembers must be able to  attain  proficiency  and qualification in 30 days or less.  BMC crewmembers must accomplish all mission-related ground training designated by their assigned SQ/CC. 1.3.3.1.2.4.  BMC  crewmembers  may  deploy  and  participate  in  any  mission  for which they are proficient and qualified, without additional training, as determined AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   11  by the SQ/CC. 1.3.3.1.2.5.  Non-BMC  (N-BMC).    Failure  to  complete  BMC  required  training results in  regression to  non-BMC (N-BMC) status.  While N-BMC, SQ/CC will determine  missions  the  crewmembers  may  perform  and  supervision  required.  Crewmembers that regress to N-BMC status will accomplish the requirements in accordance with paragraph 4.8 1.3.3.1.3.  Specialized Training.  Specialized training is training in any special skills not  required  by  every  crewmember  but  necessary  to  carry  out  the  unit's  assigned missions.    Specialized  training  is  normally  accomplished  after  a  crewmember  is assigned  CMR/BMC  status.    Unless  otherwise  specified,  crewmembers  in  CMR  or BMC positions may hold special capabilities/qualifications as long as any additional training requirements are accomplished. 1.3.3.2.  There  are  two  aspects  of  CT:    Ready  Aircrew  Program  (RAP)  and  non-RAP training requirements. 1.3.3.2.1.  RAP requirements are designed to focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish a unit's core tasked missions.  Types of training sorties and events are unit specific  and  established  by  the  MAJCOM  and  unit  commander.    Specifics  are contained in the RAP Tasking Message (RTM).  RAP requirements are annotated in Table 1.2 1.3.3.2.2.  Non-RAP training requirements ensure skills are maintained to safely and proficiently operate unit aircraft and associated equipment.  These requirements apply to all MC-12W units and generally do not change.  Non-RAP sorties and events are contained in Table 4.2 1.4.  Training Concepts and Policies (T-2): 1.4.1.  Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness consistent  with  flight  safety  and  resource  availability.    Training  must  balance  the  need  for realism  against   This instruction/volume  provides  training  guidelines  and  policies  for  use  with  operational procedures specified in applicable flying/operations publications. threat,  crewmember  capabilities,  and  safety. the  expected 1.4.2.  ACC  Training  Support  Squadron  (ACC/TRSS)  will  develop  and  validate  training programs when tasked by HQ ACC/A3.  Other MAJCOMS may submit requests for training program  support  to  the  HQ  ACC/A3.    If  validated,  these  requests  will  be  prioritized  and tasked  to  ACC/TRSS.    Designated  test  units  (CB-coded)  may  develop  syllabi  to  upgrade operation test crewmembers in support of specific test plans.  These syllabi will be approved by the TEG/CC and submitted to ACC/TRSS. 1.4.3.  Training  missions  will  be  designed  to  achieve  combat  capability  in  squadron-tasked roles, maintain proficiency  and enhance mission accomplishment  and safety.  RAP  training missions  will  emphasize  basic  combat  skills  or  scenarios  that  reflect  procedures  and operations  based  on  employment  plans,  location,  current  intelligence,  and  opposition capabilities.    Tactical  training  will  include  on-board  mission  equipment,  threat  simulators, and countermeasures.   12  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 1.4.4.  In-flight Supervision:  Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC or SQ/DO determines the  level  of  supervision  necessary  to  accomplish  the  required  training.    If  the  mission objectives include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor is required.  The following personnel must be supervised by an instructor from a like crew position when performing aircrew duties. 1.4.4.1.  All  non-current  aircrew  members.    Aircrew  members  non-current  in  an  event may fly a mission without supervision by an instructor (as applicable) provided: 1.4.4.1.1.  Expected  flight  conditions  provide  reasonable  certainty  that  performance of the non-current event will not be required in order to conduct that particular flight or mission. 1.4.4.1.2.  Flight  is  approved  by  applicable  authority  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  General Flight Rules, and local directives. Note: The Pilot in Command (PIC) is responsible for, and is the final authority as to the operation of the aircraft. 1.4.4.1.3.  At  a  minimum,  pilots  are  current  in  the  following  events:    takeoffs,  day landings, instrument approaches, all simulated single engine currencies, and approach to stall currency. 1.4.4.2.  All  aircrew  members  in  initial,  difference,  upgrade  or  requalification  flying training. 1.4.4.2.1.  Qualified members in  upgrade training  will maintain their  applicable pre-upgrade  qualification  status  throughout  upgrade  training  (paragraph  5.5).    Events accomplished  in  syllabus  training  may  update  currencies,  but  are  not  creditable  as RAP events (CT events can update RAP events). 1.4.4.2.2.  Members in upgrade training will be released from additional duties (SOF, Ops Sup, etc.) and require SQ/DO approval to be utilized for additional duties. 1.4.4.3.  Unqualified  crewmembers  and  senior  officers  as  defined  in  AFI  11-202V1and any  other  staff  personnel  the  WG,  OG,  or  SQ/CCs  designate  as  required  to  fly  with  an instructor.  For unqualified, non-current, or senior officer pilots, the instructor pilot must be at a set of controls during critical phases of flight, or when an individual is regaining currency or qualification in specific events. 1.4.4.4.  Training  events  as  specified  in  AFI  11-2-MC-12WV3,  General  Flight  Rules, Chapter 9. 1.4.5.  Evaluator  Usage:    Units  may  use  evaluators  as  instructors  for  qualification  and upgrade  training.    If  an  evaluator  is  used  as  a  primary  instructor  to  train  an  individual,  the same evaluator should not administer the associated evaluation. 1.4.6.  Every  attempt  should  be  made  to  ensure  instructor  continuity  for  crewmembers  in initial  mission  qualification,  requalification,  difference  training  and  upgrade  training.            Note:    Squadron  commanders,  operations  officers,  and  senior  enlisted  leadership  such  as Training/Operations Superintendents or Chief Enlisted Managers will not be counted against the total number of instructors. AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   13  1.4.7.  Crewmembers  will  not  be  required  to  accomplish  ground  and/or  ancillary  training except  as  required  by  this  instruction  or  AFI  36-2201,  Volume  1,  Training  Development, Delivery and Evaluation. 1.4.8.  Initial  Cadre  for  Change  of  Aircraft,  Equipment  or  Capability:    When  possible, qualified personnel in other units operating like equipment will provide the initial cadre.  In some instances, it will be necessary for units converting from one design aircraft to another to  form  an  initial  cadre  of  aircrew  personnel  for  whom  certain  training  qualification requirements may be waived.  Authorization to form initial cadre crews will be contained in the  conversion  program  action  directive.    Unless  otherwise  stated  in  the  program  action directive,  the  following  conditions  will  apply  to  management  of  initial  cadre  aircrew qualification. 1.4.8.1.  A  nucleus  of  instructor  and  flight  examiner  personnel  (initial  cadre)  will  be formed to begin aircrew conversion.  Converting units will send proposed initial cadre list by  name,  rank,  current  crew  position  and  aircraft,  total  flying  time  and  requested  crew qualification level through channels to HQ ACC/A3. 1.4.8.2.  Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held.  For example, HC-130  IP to  MC-12W  IP.  Appropriate comments  will be entered in  the remarks section of AF Form 8 explaining the individual’s status as initial cadre instructor or flight examiner.  Waiver authority rests with ACC/A3. (T-2). 1.4.8.3.  Following  final  approval,  a  squadron  letter  will  be  published  to  identify  initial cadre instructors and flight examiners by aircraft and crew qualification and file in each cadre individual’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF). 1.4.9.  Instructor Training: 1.4.9.1.  All squadron instructors will be current/qualified in the events they are teaching.  Attached instructors may maintain BMC status with approval of the SQ/CC.  Contractor Aircrew Trainers will maintain BMC status. 1.5.  Experienced Aircrew Requirements (T-2): 1.5.1.  Experienced  (EXP)  Crewmembers  must  meet  the  following  minimum  criteria  (total hours does not include student time): 1.5.1.1.  Pilots:  Pilots: 400 hours (hrs) Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI). 1.5.1.2.  Sensor Operators (SOs):  400 hrs PAI and one year qualified. 1.5.1.3.  Tactical  Systems  Operators  (TSOs):    400  hrs  total,  200  hrs  PAI  and  one  year qualified. 1.5.2.  At the discretion  of the SQ/CC, requirements  for PAI  and qualification time may be decreased or eliminated based on the member’s previous qualifications. 1.6.  RAP Policy and Management (T-2): 1.6.1.  MC-12W units are considered Low-Supply/High-Demand (LSHD) and are not aligned against a specific AEF pair.  Therefore, the RAP training period is aligned with a 12-month cycle, in order to best prepare for high operations tempo outside the normal AEF cycle.  The   14  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 12-month  training  cycle  runs  from  1  October  through  30  September.    Units  will  reference their MAJCOM RAP tasking message for specified training cycle and reporting procedures. 1.6.2.  Each RAP qualification level is defined by a total number and type of RAP missions, plus  specific  weapons  delivery/sensor  qualifications  as  determined  by  MAJCOM  and  unit commanders.  The breakout of sorties and mission types is provided as a guideline. 1.6.3.  Variations in sortie/mission types may be used as a basis for regression by the SQ/CC.  Qualification in a mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering the MAJCOM guidance and the individual’s capabilities. 1.6.4.  An  effective  RAP  or  training  sortie  requires  accomplishing  events  as  determined  by the SQ/CC or SQ/DO and Attachment 2. 1.6.5.  The SQ/CC and SQ/DO’s first priority should be to train all designated crewmembers to CMR. 1.6.6.  CMR status requirements: 1.6.6.1.  One month look-back at the CMR mission rate. 1.6.6.2.  Qualification in all core missions and sensor events required at CMR. 1.6.6.3.  Confirmation the progressed crewmember can complete the prorated number of sortie and event requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle. 1.6.6.4.  Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification. 1.6.6.5.  SQ/CC certification: 1.6.7.  Special  Certifications  or  Qualifications:   SQ/CCs  will  determine  and  assign crewmembers who will train for and maintain special certifications or qualifications.  Special certifications  and  qualification  sortie  and  event  requirements  are  normally  accomplished  in addition to baseline CMR/BMC sortie/event requirements. 1.6.8.  CMR  and  BMC  (wing-level  and  below)  crewmembers  will  fly  the  required  monthly mission  rate.    If  they  are  unable  to  maintain  this  mission  rate,  the  rules  of  regression  will apply. 1.6.9.  End of Cycle training requirements are based on the crewmembers’ experience level and qualifications on the last day of the current training cycle. 1.6.10.  Units converting to another Mission Design Series (MDS) may fly crewmembers in CMR positions at the BMC rate until one month prior to the operationally ready date if CMR mission rates cannot be supported.  CMR crewmembers should be flown at a CMR rate for the month prior to IOC.  Active duty wings converting to new MDS are authorized one SQ-equivalent  of  additional  API-6s  during  the  conversion  period.    However,  total  wing  staff flying the new aircraft shall not exceed total authorized for final conversion equipage. (T-3). 1.7.  RAP Training Mission Program Development (T-2): 1.7.1.  RAP sortie and event requirements (see Attachment 2 for definitions) apply to CMR and  BMC  crewmembers  as  well  as  those  individuals  carrying  special  capabilities  or qualifications  and  are  IAW  the  RAP  tasking  message.    The  requirements  in  Table  1.2 establish  the  minimum  number  of  sortie/missions  per  training  cycle  for  BMC  and  CMR AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   15  levels of training.  The current RTM takes precedence over this volume and may contain an updated sortie requirement or missions, events and currencies not incorporated in Table 1.2, Table 1.3, Table 4.2, Table 4.3 Table 4.4, Table 5.1 or in Attachment 2. Table 1.2.  Minimum sortie/mission requirements per training cycle for BMC and CMR crewmembers. MAJCOM   CYCLE  PILOTS / SENSOR TACTICAL SYSTEMS OPERATORS OPERATORS BMC  CMR BMC  CMR  INEXP/EXP INEXP/EXP INEXP/EXP INEXP/EXP ACC /ANG 1-month 4 6/4   Look-back  3-month Look-back  12-month RAP total  2 6 4/2 12/6 12 18/12 48 72/48 24 48/24 1.7.2.  Non-RAP requirements, missions and events designed to ensure maintenance of basic crewmember skills  are in  addition  to  RAP  requirements.  Crewmembers may log non-RAP events  on RAP  sorties provided there is  no effect  on RAP  sortie effectiveness.   Unit  flying hour  programs  contain  sorties  for  crewmembers  to  accomplish  their  minimum  non-RAP requirements. 1.7.3.  Collateral  or  cost-of-business  mission  requirements  will  be  considered  when developing  unit  flying  hour  programs.    These  missions  do  not  directly  relate  to  combat employment or basic skills training but are necessary for accomplishment of day-to-day unit operations.    Functional  check  flights  and  aerial  demonstration  support  are  in  this  category.  RAP training does not require these sorties. 1.7.4.  Unit  flying  hour  programs  contain  a  number  of  attrition  sorties  that  compensate  for non-effective  training  sorties.    Log  a  non-effective  sortie  when  valid  training  for  a  planned RAP or non-RAP training mission due to poor weather, air aborts, etc.  In order to allocate accurate  numbers  of  attrition  sorties  to  unit  flying  hour  programs,  it  is  essential  units appropriately log non-effective sorties. 1.7.5.  Pilots  and  Sensor  Operators  must  log  all  RAP  sorties  in  the  MC-12W  with  the exception  of  Pilot  Proficiency  Sorties.    Tactical  Systems  Operators  may  log  up  to  50%  of their RAP sortie requirements in non-MC-12 like-mission aircraft (i.e. BE350) 1.8.  Training Records and Reports:   16  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 1.8.1.  A training folder will be initiated for all qualification, upgrade and additional training directed by the squadron commander or a flight examiner. (T-3). 1.8.1.1.  The  training  folder  will  include  approved  Air  Force  forms  for  all  training reports,  other  approved  reports,  all  certifications,  waivers  and  other  applicable  records unit  training  managers  require  to  establish  a  historical  record  of  an  individual’s  ability and performance. (T-3). 1.8.1.2.  The  training  documents  will  be  placed  in  reverse  chronological  order  with  the most recent on top. (T-3). 1.8.1.3.  The SQ/CC or designated representative will conduct a review of active training folders prior to any flight evaluation required for training program completion.  Annotate the review in the student’s folder. (T-3). 1.8.1.4.  Instructors  will  review  training  folders  prior  to  each  training  period  (flight  or simulator)  to  develop  a  training  plan.    After  each  period,  instructors  will  document training  in  sufficient  detail  to  accurately  assess  student  performance  and  make recommendations for subsequent training. (T-3). 1.8.1.5.  Instructors  will  make  a  recommendation  for  an  in-flight  evaluation  after  the student satisfactorily completes all required training. (T-3). 1.8.1.6.  Students will review and initial training records after each training period. (T-3). 1.8.1.7.  Units  will  maintain  training  folders  on  each  aircrew  member.    Units  may  keep electronic  or  paper  copies  of  the  training  history.    However,  electronic  copies  are preferred to facilitate coordination with expeditionary units. (T-3). 1.8.2.  Units will maintain crewmember records for individual training and evaluations IAW. (T-2): 1.8.2.1.  AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training 1.8.2.2.

Requirements  and  accomplishment  of  individual  sorties,  RAP  sorties  and missions types and events cumulatively for the training cycle. 1.8.3.3.  Look-back:    RAP  mission  requirements  and  accomplishment  using  one  month and three month running totals for look-back. 1.8.3.4.  Currencies:  Sortie and event currencies required for unsupervised flight. AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   17  1.8.3.5.  Sensor  employment  records  in  sufficient  detail  to  document  all  employment attempts and histories. 1.8.4.  Units may fill in ARMS "NO DATE" with either the date of the last MQT sortie or the unit mission-certification date. (T-3). 1.9.  Crewmember Utilization Policy:  (T-3) 1.9.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  wing/group  crewmembers  (API-1/6,A/B)  fill  authorized positions IAW unit manning documents and that crewmember status is properly designated.  The overall objective is that crewmembers are capable of performing combat-related duties. Supervisors may assign crewmembers to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, FEB/mishap board  member,  etc.),  but  must  continually  weigh  the  factors  involved,  such  as  level  of crewmember tasking, flying proficiency, currency and experience. 1.9.1.1.  Supervisors  should  limit  non-flying  duties  to  ensure  maximized  flying  training efforts for inexperienced aircrew in the first year of their initial operational assignment. 1.9.2.  Commanders must ensure MC-12W crewmembers assigned duties are commensurate with their level of assignment (for an additional duty). 1.9.2.1.  Units  may  assign  the  following  duties  as  required  by  various  AFI’s  and MAJCOM directives  to CAF squadron-level crewmembers: 1.9.2.1.1.  Tactics officer 1.9.2.1.2.  Scheduler 1.9.2.1.3.  Flying safety officer 1.9.2.1.4.  Supervisor of Flying (SOF) 1.9.2.1.5.  Mobility and contingency plans officer 1.9.2.1.6.  Training officer (except ARMS documentation) 1.9.2.1.7.  SQ Stan/Eval liaison officer 1.9.2.1.8.  Other duties directly related to flying operations 1.9.2.1.9.  Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup) as applicable to the unit 1.9.2.2.  Squadron-assigned  MC-12W  crewmembers  should  not  be  attached  to  wing  or group  staffs  or  man  wing  or  group  staff  positions  with  squadron-assigned  MC-12W crewmembers unless total wing, group, and squadron MC-12W manning allows.  In some instances,  such  as  squadron-assigned  flying  safety  officers,  units  may  attach  squadron-assigned MC-12W crewmembers to the wing. 1.9.2.3.  Commanders  (CCs)  will  assure  wing-and-above  staff  crewmembers  perform duties justified in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and fill positions authorized in UMDs. 1.9.3.  Crewmembers  will  not  perform  long-term  duties  (greater  than  two  months)  which detract from their primary duties of training for, or performing, the unit flying mission. 1.10.  Sortie Allocation Guidance:   18  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 1.10.1.  In general, inexperienced crewmembers should receive sortie allocation priority over experienced crewmembers.  Crewmember experience level definitions are in paragraph 1.5. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows: 1.10.1.1.  Formal Training (TF-Coded) Units 1.10.1.1.1.  Formal syllabus training 1.10.1.1.2.  Instructor Upgrade Training 1.10.1.1.3.  Instructor CT 1.10.1.1.4.

Requirements directed by MAJCOM 1.10.1.3.2.  Training required to prepare for assigned projects and tasking 1.10.1.3.3.  BMC  training  requirements  that  cannot  be  accomplished  on  primary missions 1.10.2.  Wing API-6/B authorizations are IAW unit manning documents 1.10.3.  For wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, at least one of the following crewmembers will maintain MC-12W instructor status: (T-2) 1.10.3.1.  WG/CC 1.10.3.2.  WG/CV 1.10.3.3.  OG/CC 1.10.3.4.  OG/CD 1.10.4.  For  FTU-only  wings,  all  API-6  crewmembers  will  maintain  instructor  status (optional  for  WG/CC,  OG/CC  and  FCF  crews).    FTU-only  wings  will  fly  API-1/6 crewmembers as required by programmed flying training (PFT). (T-2) 1.10.5.  API-8/D  rated  personnel  flying  authorizations  will  be  IAW  AFI  11-401  and MAJCOM guidance.  Above-Wing-Level and test unit crewmembers will fly the BMC rate; however,  are  not  required  to  complete  BMC-specific  missions  and  events  or  meet  monthly look-back  requirements.    They  will  accomplish  non-RAP  requirements  within  their  BMC number  of  sorties.    Units  should  provide  assigned  crewmembers  adequate  resources  to maintain minimum training requirements; however, the support will not come at the expense AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   19  of the flying squadron's primary mission.  API 6/8/B/D flyers will strive to accomplish non-RAP  requirements  with  allotted  BMC  sorties.    If  units  cannot  meet  attached  crewmember requirements,  they  must  request  relief  IAW  AFI  11-401,  MAJCOM  Supplement.    Units requiring flying hour adjustments for attached crewmembers must request program changes IAW MAJCOM instructions. (T-2) 1.10.6.  (ANG: N/A)  There is no maximum sortie count for CMR crewmembers.  Table 1.3 defines  the  minimum  and  maximum  sortie  requirements  for  other  crewmembers.    On occasion,  unique  operations  may  require  crewmembers  to  fly  more  than  the  maximum number  of  sorties  authorized,  however,  this  may  impact  training  of  other  crewmembers.  Crewmembers  assigned  or  attached  to  ACC  Office  of  the  Inspector  General  (ACC/IGS)  as API-6/B will maintain RAP currencies/look-back per API-8/D guidance. (T-2) Table 1.3.

Waiver Authority: 1.11.1.  With  MAJCOM/A3  approval,  waiver  authority  for  all  requirements  of  the  RAP tasking  memo  is  the  OG/CC  or  the  Test  and  Evaluation  Group  Commander  (TEG/CC).  Additional  guidance may  be provided in  the memo.   Unless  specifically  noted otherwise in the appropriate section, and also with MAJCOM/A3 approval, the OG/CC or TEG/CC may adjust  individual  requirements,  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  to  accommodate  variations  in aircrew  member  experience  and  performance.    For  all  other  provisions  of  this  volume,  and IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1, the waiver authority is MAJCOM/A3. (T-2). 1.11.2.  Waiver  authority  for  supplemental  guidance  will  be  as  specified  in  the  supplement and approved through higher level coordination authority. 1.11.3.  Units subordinate to a Numbered Air Force (NAF) will forward requests directly to MAJCOM OPR and provide their NAF OPR with an information copy.   20  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 1.11.4.  Waivers to this volume will be valid until end of training cycle, unless the approving official cancels it in writing, or revises the publication. AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   21  Chapter 2 INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT) 2.1.  General: 2.1.1.  This  chapter  outlines  Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT)  of  crewmembers  into  the MC-12W  and  BE-350  aircraft.    IQT  includes  Basic  Training  (B-Course),  Requalification Training (TX) and Senior Officer Training. 2.1.2.  IQT will normally be conducted during a formal syllabus course at an FTU. training 2.1.3.  When  FTU  training  is  not  available,  pilots  may  complete  a  MAJCOM  and  FAA-approved  King  Air  350  (BE-350)  commercial  training  course.    An  FAA-approved commercial systems, normal/abnormal/emergency procedures and flight simulation. (T-2).  The flight simulations should  allow  pilots  50%  time  in  both  seats.    The  training  is  considered  complete  upon satisfactory  completion  of  an  end  of  course  FAA  equivalent  evaluation.    Completion  of  an FAA type rating is not required. general course shall consist of aircraft 2.1.4.

General: 3.1.1.  The  ACC  Syllabus  Course  for  the  MC-12W  is  considered  an  MQT  formal  training course  and  will  conclude  with  a  mission  (MSN)  flight  evaluation.    Unit-developed  and administered training programs  to  certify a crewmember CMR/  BMC are also  considered  a part of MQT.  Guidance in this chapter is provided to assist unit CCs in developing an MQT program. 3.1.2.  Individuals  should  complete  MQT  training  within  180  days  of  completing  IQT training.    Training  will  culminate  with  a  mission  evaluation  IAW  AFI11-MC-12WV2, resulting in qualification as either an aircraft/mission commander, mission co-pilot, mission SO, or mission TSO.  A unit-administered MQT program requires OG/CC approval (a copy of local MQT training programs will be forwarded to the MAJCOM). 3.1.3.  Units  may  tailor  the  program  for  each  crewmember  based  on  experience,  currency, documented performance and formal training. 3.1.4.  Sorties  and  events  for  a  unit-administered  MQT  program  will  be  based  on  the unaccomplished  portion  of  ACC  Syllabus  Course  MC-12W  and  additional  events  and/or sorties needed to qualify a crewmember in the unit-specific mission and TTPs. (T-3) 3.1.5.  Units  will  ensure  events  not  accomplished  in  MQT  are  completed  or  waived  before the  individual  is  certified  BMC  or  CMR.    The  gaining  SQ/CC  must  approve  any  items waived or not accomplished in MQT. (T-3) 3.1.6.  MQT  will  normally  be  completed  within  90  days  of  the  individual’s  start  of  MQT training.    Training  time  exceeding  90  days  requires  SQ/CC  coordination/approval.    MQT training is complete upon evaluation and SQ/CC certification to BMC/CMR. 3.1.7.  Prior  to  CMR  certification,  crewmembers  must  initially  qualify  in  all  mission  and sensor events required to be Qualified (QUAL) at CMR. (T-3) 3.2.  Ground Training:  (T-3) 3.2.1.  Units  will  develop  blocks  of  instruction  covering  areas  pertinent  to  the  mission  as determined by the SQ/CC.  Training accomplished during IQT may be credited toward  this requirement. 3.2.1.1.  CMR  Certification:    Crewmembers  will  complete  an  initial  CMR  certification brief to the SQ/CC within 90 days after completing MQT.  Failure to comply will result in regression to N-CMR until the certification is complete. 3.2.1.2.  Initial Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Defensive Training (INBCDT).  The  MC-12W  is  not  configured  to  conduct  operations  in  an  NBC  environment.  Therefore, the NBC training requirement for MC-12W aircrew may be determined by the flying unit or as directed by the RAP tasking message. AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   25  3.2.1.3.  MC-12W  entry/exit/emergency  egress  procedures.    Crewmembers  will  initially learn  entry,  exit,  and  emergency  egress  procedures  during  MQT  and  receive  recurring training in accordance with table 4.1 of this publication. 3.3.  Simulator Training:  (T-2) 3.3.1.  If  an  OFT  is  unavailable,  MQT  simulator  requirements  may  be  accomplished  in  an operational  MC-12W  aircraft.    Operational  aircraft  may  also  be  used  to  accomplish appropriate  switchology  and  emergency  procedures  training  based  upon  the  availability  of OFT’s  and/or  aircraft.    MQT  crewmembers  should  fly  training  device  mission  profiles  that replicate  wartime  tasking.    Training  device  mission  will  include  selected  critical  action emergency  procedures, spatial  disorientation,  channelized  attention  and  unusual attitude/inadvertent weather entry procedures. 3.3.2.  MQT OFT Event Requirements: 3.3.2.1.  Instruments  and  Emergency  Procedures  (EPs):    Mission  preparation,  normal ground  operations,  flight  operations,  navigation  and  published  to  home  base  and  any specified  alternate,  partial  panel  instrument  approaches,  post-flight  ground  operations, Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) and selected non-CAPs EPs will be accomplished. 3.3.2.2.  Tactical  Scenarios  should than 15,500lbs),  tactical  procedures,  tactical  navigation,  sensor  operations,  sensor  anomalies, emergency divert/recovery procedures and selected emergency procedures. takeoff  (greater include:   heavyweight 3.3.2.3.  Tactical  Mission/Emergency  Procedures  Evaluation:    This  mission  will  be administered  by  a  SEFE  IAW  AFI  11-202V2,  AFI  11-2MC12WV2  and  MAJCOM  and local directives. 3.4.  Flying Training:  (T-3) 3.4.1.  Unit-developed  MQT  programs  should  use  profiles  typical  of  squadron  missions.  Maximum  use  of  sensor  recording  assets  during  sensor  operations  are  encouraged  on  all MQT missions. 3.4.2.  Supervision:    An  IP/ISO/ITSO  is  required  unless  specified  otherwise.    The  SQ/CC will determine the physical position of supervision unless specified otherwise.  For example, the IP will always sit in the pilot/co-pilot seat during critical phases of flight but once safely airborne  may  swap  seats  to  allow  both  MQT  pilots  to  fly  and  tackle  the  mission  scenario based  on  syllabus,  AFI  and/or  SQ/CC  direction.    As  a  reminder,  all  MQT  pilots  are Instrument/Qualification checkride complete. 3.4.3.  Prerequisites and Currency:  If more than seven calendar days elapse between sorties, an  additional  break  in  training  sortie  may  be  flown  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC  before continuing the formal MQT syllabus. 3.4.4.  Tactical Mission Evaluation:  This mission will be administered by an evaluation IAW AFI  11-202V2,  AFI  11-2MC-12WV2  and  applicable  local  directives.    Crews  will  only  be evaluated on events in which they are trained.   26  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General:  (T-2) 4.1.1.

Ground training requirements are IAW Table 4.1 and the RTM.  Waiver authority for the  ground  training  specified  is  IAW  the  reference  directive  in  Table  4.1.  (T-3).    Ground training  accomplished  during  IQT/MQT  may  be  credited  toward  CT  requirements  for  the training  cycle  in  which  it  was  accomplished.    Table  4.1  is  a  reference  for  crewmembers ground training only.  This table does not include all Air Force ancillary training, which will also  be  tracked  at  unit  level.    Where  discrepancies  exist,  the  reference  directive  takes precedence.    Chapter  5  contains  upgrade  training  programs  with  both  flying  and  ground training requirements. 4.2.2.  Instrument  Refresher  Course  (IRC):    IRC  will  be  completed  IAW  AFMAN  11-210, Instrument Refresher Course Program; AFI 11-202V2; and MAJCOM supplements. 4.2.3.  MC-12W Operational Flight Trainers (OFT) will be used for simulator missions to the maximum extent possible. 4.2.3.1.  If  an  MC-12W  OFT  is  not  available,  aircrew  may  complete  training  in  a commercially available  BE-300 or  BE-350 series equivalent  Simulator or other Aircraft Training  Device  (ATD),  including  Part-Task  Trainer,  or  Cockpit  Procedures  Trainer (CPT). 4.2.3.2.  EP OFT: 4.2.3.2.1.  Mission  Objectives:    Practice  in-flight  EPs  and  maintain  proficiency  in applying aircraft general knowledge to abnormal situations. 4.2.3.2.2.  Specific Mission Tasks:  Instrument approach procedures, unusual attitude recoveries,  spatial  disorientation,  inadvertent  weather  entry,  controlled  flight departure recognition and spin recovery procedures, CAPs, aircraft subsystem failure checklist procedures, in-flight EPs and instrument procedures. 4.2.3.3.  Tactical OFT: 4.2.3.3.1.  Units will determine additional  CT training device requirements based on expected  employment  tasking,  training  device  capabilities  and  mission  training objectives.  Units will review scenarios annually and update as required.  Units will determine appropriate supervision levels for ATD missions/tasks.  Units will track all aircrew device training used to satisfy RAP and non-RAP requirements. 4.2.3.3.2.  Mission  Objectives:  Maintain  proficiency  in  combat  scenario  based  on expected  employment  tasking  and  training  device  capabilities.    Practice  in-flight malfunctions  applying  tactical  and  systems  knowledge  to  combat  scenarios.  Emphasis  should  be  placed  on  training  not  readily  attainable  during  daily  flying activities. 4.2.3.3.3.  Specific  Mission  Tasks:  Designed  Operational  Capability  (DOC)-relevant simulated  combat  employment,  threat  recognition  and  counter  tactics,  sensor malfunction  procedures,  relevant  CAPs  and  aircraft  subsystem  failure  procedures.  Inadvertent weather entry procedures training and unusual attitude recovery training. 4.2.4.  Situational  Emergency  Procedures  Training  (SEPT):    This  training  is  not  an evaluation,  but  a  review  of  abnormal/emergency  procedures  and  aircraft  systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   29  4.2.4.1.  The  following  guidelines  will  be  used  in  development  and  execution  of    the SEPT training program. 4.2.4.1.1.  Develop  SEPT  scenarios  using  MC-12W,  or  other  similar  aircraft, mishaps/incidents as baseline cases. 4.2.4.1.2.  SQ/CC or SQ/DO should provide inputs in the selection of monthly SEPT topics. 4.2.4.2.  SEPTs  should  be  accomplished  in  the  best  ATD  available.    Completion  of  an ATD EP profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement. 4.2.4.2.1.  If an ATD is not available, SEPTs should be accomplished as a crew, but small  flight-sized  groups  led  by  a  qualified  aircraft  commander  are  allowable  if  all members participate to the full extent and share equal time responding to emergency situations. 4.2.4.3.  Accomplish one SEPT each calendar month prior to the first flight of the month.  The intent of the program is to accomplish 12 SEPTs per calendar year. 4.2.4.3.1.  Discuss at least one EP for each phase of flight during the SEPT using the approved monthly SEPT scenarios.  One crewmember should present a situation and another  crewmember  discusses  actions  necessary  to  cope  with  the  malfunction  and carry it to a logical conclusion.  A review of all CAPs should be accomplished, and all special interest items should be emphasized. 4.2.4.4.  Accomplish four supervised SEPTs each training period with an IP or SQ/CC or SQ/DO  approved  SQ  supervisor.    IPs/supervisors  who  administer/observe  EP  ATDs satisfy their monthly SEPT requirement. 4.2.4.5.  Formal  course  student  EP/ATDs  may  be  used  satisfy  the  monthly  SEPT requirement for the IP administering the training. 4.2.5.  Tactics Academic Training:  Units will establish a weapons/tactics academic training program  to  satisfy  MQT  and  CT  requirements.    The  program  will  require  successful completion of an examination (85 percent minimum to pass).  Testing will be used to validate qualification training  program.  Crewmembers successfully scoring 85 percent or greater may be given training credit in lieu of ground CT, where authorized by the governing publication.  Audiovisual/Computer-Based Training (CBT) programs may be used in place of academic instruction. the  maximum  extent  possible to throughout the 4.2.5.1.  Academic instructors should be USAF Weapons Instructors Course (USAFWIC) graduates  or  have  training/operational  experience  applicable  to  teach  the  academic portions of MC-12W weapons/tactics employment. 4.2.5.2.  Instruction and tests should include (as applicable), but not limited to: 4.2.5.2.1.  Air-to-surface  sensors:    Description,  operation,  parameters,  limitations, preflight, tactics, normal and emergency procedures/techniques. 4.2.5.2.2.

The  intelligence  training  program will be developed in coordination with the unit’s weapons and tactics training program.  The focus and extent of academic training will be determined by the Unit/CC and will be aligned with  projected  wartime  tasking,  threats,  and  unit  equipage.    Supervisory  personnel  above squadron level maintaining mission qualification do not require this item. 4.2.7.  The  intelligence  training  plan  will  be  specifically  tailored  to  meet  unit/mission requirements.    Each  item  will  be  taught  at  least  once  during  the  annual  training  cycle.  Training categories include but are not limited to threat knowledge, visual recognition (VR), collection and reporting (C&R), and personnel recovery (PR). 4.2.7.1.  Threat  Knowledge.    Threat  knowledge  training  is  tailored  to  the  unit  mission, local  area,  deployment  base(s),  and  forward  operating  locations  and  is  concentrated  on threats  in  selected  countries  with  the  potential  for  direct  unit  involvement.    Training methods  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  threat-of-the  day  briefings,  weapons  and tactics academics, theater orientation briefings, weapons system videos, etc. 4.2.7.2.  Visual  Recognition.    VR  training  is  tailored  to  the  unit  mission,  local  area, deployment  base(s),  and  forward  operating  locations.    It  will  include  enemy/adversary, friendly or neutral weapon systems relevant to the prospective operational environment.  Training should teach how to describe threats to assist intelligence personnel in positive identification  and  include  examples  of  weapons  employment  to  illustrate  how  threats might appear when employed. 4.2.7.3.  Collection  and  Reporting.    C&R  training  enables  aircrew  to  initiate  aircrew originated  reports;  Inflight  Report  (INFLTREP),  and  Communication  Instructions Reporting Vital Intelligence Sighting (CIRVIS).  Training will familiarize them with the information  requirements  of  the  intelligence-generated  Mission  Report  (MISREP)  and Intelligence Report (INTREP).  A critical component of C&R training will be the unit’s AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   31  essential  elements  of  information  (EEI).    Training  will  identify  and  describe  theater-specific and peacetime reporting requirements. 4.2.7.4.  Personnel  Recovery.    When  assigned,  a  SERE  specialist  will  conduct  PR operational support training.  If intelligence personnel do provide PR operational support training  it  will  address:   PR  materials  (Isolated  Personnel  Report  (ISOPREP) maintenance  and  review,  evasion  plan  of  action  (EPA)  preparation  and  theater  combat recovery procedures. 4.2.8.  Air  Force  Anti-terrorism/Force  Protection  as  required  IAW  AFI  10-245,  Air  Force Antiterrorism (AT) Standards. 4.2.9.  Crew Resource Management (CRM):  Units will participate in MAJCOM established CRM  CT.    Training  builds  upon  the  basic  crew  management  skills  taught  in  Specialized Undergraduate Pilot training (SUPT) and FTUs.  Each crewmember is required to participate in one session every 24 months.  Training will be tracked in Aviation Resource Management System  (ARMS).    Failure  to  attend  CRM  training  results  in  grounding  (waiverable  by OG/CC). (T-3). Briefings and debriefings will include the core curriculum of CRM training IAW  AFI  11-290,  Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management  Training  Program  and  the appropriate MAJCOM Supplement to AFI 11-290.  The instructor CRM course may be used to satisfy the requirement. 4.2.10.  Enlisted Systems Operator Career Progression Training:  Enlisted Systems Operators must maintain core competency knowledge, skills and abilities in their enlisted career fields.  Use  assigned  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  or  Air  Force  Job Qualification  Standard  (AFJQS)  to  develop  and  manage  Systems  Operator  skill-level  and continuation  training.

If in-unit training is accomplished in lieu of formal school attendance, unit is responsible for ensuring all requirements are completed. 2.  Mandatory grounding item after expiration date; individual will not fly until required training is accomplished (VV01 is only grounding for night sorties using NVGs/ GA09 is grounding for aircraft with crypto loaded). 3.  Individuals may be declared CMR without completing event GA42 and GA43.  Complete GA42 and GA43 not later than 180-days prior to deployment. 4.  Initial training is called S-V80-A or S-V86-A according to AFI 16-1301 see paragraph 2.3.2.  This training is not accomplished at the FTU but should be completed before member arrives at the gaining unit.  If the member arrives at the gaining unit without this training, it should be scheduled as soon as practical. 5.  LL06 should be accomplished in conjunction with SS07, SS02, or SS05 and are mandatory  Grounding items:  individuals will not fly until event is accomplished, additionally must be re-accomplished upon arrival after each permanent change of station. 6.  Conducted as a review of the MQT SDP academic briefing. 7.  Conducted IAW SQ/CC discretion (i.e. class, exam, etc.) to include frequency and if it is a grounding item. 8.  Simulator events dual credits actual acft event; For IQT purposes only, simulator evaluations will dual credit aircraft evaluations. 9.  Instructors only. ARMS will track all ground training events required by aircrew.  4.3.  Flying Training:  (T-3) 4.3.1.  All  crewmembers  (except  API-8  and  ACC/IGS  crewmembers)  will  accomplish  the requirements in Table  4.1, Table  4.2, Table  4.3  and Table  4.4 as applicable to their crew position and qualifications.  Failure to accomplish the requirements in Table 4.2, Table 4.3 and  Table  4.4    will  affect  the  crewmembers  currency  status  and  may  require  additional training  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC.    Failure  to  accomplish  the  requirements  specified  in this paragraph or the RAP tasking message may require loss of certification or qualification (recertification or re-qualification is IAW paragraph  4.7).  In addition, crewmembers must meet  the  following  requirements  (API-8  and  ACC/IGS  flyers  will  strive  to  accomplish  the requirements as shown in Table 4.2, Table 4.3 and Table 4.4):   34  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 4.3.2.  Instrument Flying Training: 4.3.2.1.  Units  will  develop  and  implement  an  instrument  flying  training  program  to ensure instrument  proficiency.  Programs  will include briefings on recognition  and how to  deal  with  spatial  disorientation,  unusual  attitude  recoveries,  transition  between  visual and instrument conditions, weather avoidance and navigation procedures. 4.3.2.2.  Units  will  also  develop  theater-specific  instrument  academic  programs  for inclusion in their pre-deployment spin-up training programs.  Units will include a course on MC-12W  weather operations/limitations and navigation  capabilities in  their theater-specific instrument academic training. 4.3.3.  Pilot Proficiency Sortie (PPS):  Crews must maintain a high level of proficiency with basic aircraft flight procedures.  A PPS is a mission to practice instrument, transition, traffic patterns and emergency procedures.  Maneuvers will be flown under the direct supervision of an  IP.    An  IP  should  log  a  PPS  with  IP  supervision,  when  possible.    IPs  and  EPs  are  not required to  fly with  another  IP to  credit this event.   All maneuvers will be completed to  an acceptable level of proficiency as determined by the IP to log the PPS.  Should the PPS be incomplete  for  weather,  aircraft  malfunction,  or  pilot  performance,  the  instructor  will determine if the entire PPS will be re-accomplished or just the incomplete events.  Instructors need  not  accomplish  all  the  events  on  a  single  sortie.    The  PPS  will  be  credited  upon completion  of  the  last  event.    A  PPS  should  be  briefed  as  a  standard  alternate  mission whenever possible and should consist of the following: 4.3.3.1.  Two instrument approaches (one precision and one non-precision if available). 4.3.3.2.  A holding pattern or procedure turn. 4.3.3.3.  Simulated engine-out approach, go-around and landing. 4.3.3.4.  A Circling Approach (traffic permitting). 4.3.3.5.  VFR traffic pattern (weather permitting). 4.3.3.6.  Landings at all flap settings prescribed by the flight manual. 4.3.3.7.  A review of CAPs. 4.4.  Aircrew  Flight  Training/Currency  Requirements:  MC-12W  aircrew  will  accomplish training/currency  requirements  during  the  unit  training  cycle  IAW  Table  4.2,  Table  4.3  and Table  4.4 and the RTM.  Failure to accomplish required proficiency items will affect currency status as identified in table 4.2 and may require additional training as determined by the SQ/CC.  If any sortie/event from Table 4.2, Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 is subsequently converted to a RAP requirement in the RTM, failing to accomplish that requirement may affect CMR/BMC status, as designated.  The OG/CC is the waiver authority for flying training requirements listed in  Table 4.1, Table 4.2, Table 4.3, Table 4.4  and the RAP tasking message. (T-3).  IAW 11-202V1 RAP events should be accomplished evenly throughout the RAP cycle to the max extent possible.  (T-2 unless otherwise delineated) 4.4.1.  Crediting Event Accomplishment: 4.4.1.1.  Typically,  aircrew  members  should  only  log  one  RAP  sortie  type  per  flight (Basic  Mission  Sortie  (SR04)  Pilot  Proficiency  Sortie  (SR70),  or  Reconnaissance, AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   35  Surveillance  and  Target  Acquisition  Sortie  (SR43)  –  see  below)  with  the  following exceptions: 4.4.1.1.1.  A  crewmember  is  relieved  by  another  crewmember  for  the  purpose  of accomplishing a sortie and then subsequently takes over the position again during the same flight. 4.4.1.1.2.  Crewmembers  who  remain  on  the  aircraft  after  an  Engine  Running  Crew Change (ERRC) may log an additional RAP Sortie if training is accomplished on the subsequent sortie. 4.4.1.1.3.  Pilots  may dual  log  a PPS (SR70) with  a mission sortie  (SR01, SR43), if the requirements for both are met. 4.4.1.2.  Instructors/evaluators  who  occupy  a  primary  crew  position  during  a  tactical sortie for at least one hour of flight time or a scenario taken to a logical conclusion should log  a  RAP  sortie  (Basic  Mission  Sortie  (SR04)  or  Reconnaissance,  Surveillance  and Target  Acquisition Sortie (SR43)) and an instructor event  (ME10).   In this case, do not log an Instructor/Evaluator Sortie (SX09). 4.4.1.3.  Instructors/evaluators may log up to 50% of their monthly RAP sorties (typically two per month) while instructing from the jump seat even if they do not occupy a primary crew  position  during  a  tactical  sortie  for  at  least  one  hour  of  flight  time  or  a  scenario taken to a logical conclusion.  Log these sorties as specified in paragraph 4.4.1.2. 4.4.1.3.1.  Instructors/evaluators who fly in excess of the 50% of their monthly RAP sorties  while  instructing  from  the  jump  seat  should  log  Instructor/Evaluator  Sortie (SX09) and an instructor event (ME10). This is a non-RAP sortie and does not count CT look-back requirements. 4.4.1.4.  In  addition  to  events  accomplished  on  training  and  operational  missions,  those flight  events  accomplished  on  a  satisfactory  qualification,  mission  qualification, specialized  mission  qualification,  or  requalification  evaluation  may  be  credited  towards the individual’s currency requirements and to establish subsequent due dates. 4.4.1.5.  Crewmembers who are unqualified in the aircraft due to an unsatisfactory flight evaluation  will  not  log  continuation  training  requirements  for  events  graded  Q-3  IAW AFI 11-2MC-12W, Volume 2, Aircrew Evaluation Criteria, until re-qualified. 4.4.1.6.  Make-up  training  (ground  or  flying)  is  creditable  towards  the  new  training period. 4.4.1.7.  Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the accrediting criteria of this instruction are met.  Compatible sorties and events  may be credited on the same flight. 4.4.1.8.  Flying  training  events  accomplished  during  formal  training  will  use  the  course completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all subsequent currency  and  requirements.    Use  actual  dates  for  ground  training.    Certification  events trained  to  a  3C  during  qualification/requalification  training  will  use  the  date  of  the  last accomplished and log after checkride completion (i.e. LD02 - Night Landing:  checkride was accomplished 20 May  and last night  landing was 5 May  – member  will log 5 May date for LD02).   36  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 4.4.1.9.  Simulator  Credit  for  Flight  Training  Events:    Crewmembers  may  credit  events accomplished  in  an  ATD,  certified  for  the  event  by  lead  MAJCOM,  unless  otherwise specified by the respective event description in  Attachment  2,  Table  4.2, or the RTM.  No more than 50% of the annual flight training events may be credited.  A certified ATD may be used to maintain or regain currency in those events. Table 4.2.

Flight Surgeon:   Flight surgeons may participate in continuation training missions as observers.  Units will develop appropriate continuation training mission orientation programs for assigned flight surgeons. 4.5.2.  Above-Wing-Level  Crewmembers  (ANG:    Responsibilities  for  API-8/D  staff  flyers are contained in AFI 11-401 as supplemented by the ANG): 4.5.2.1.  Mission Directed Training (MDT) for Above-Wing-Level personnel (other than that  conducted  in  support  of  a  formal  inspection)  requires  coordination  with  the supporting  unit.    MAJCOM  A3Ts  are  the  reviewing  authorities  for  assigned  personnel.  They will: AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   39  4.5.2.1.1.  Coordinate  with  the  supporting  agency  to  ensure  maintenance  of appropriate ARMS data and provide that data IAW AFI 11-401. 4.5.2.1.2.  Review  assigned  crewmember  accomplishments  and  currencies  prior  to authorizing participation in MDT. 4.5.2.1.3.  Provide  each  crewmember  with  written  documentation  specifying  the authorized  mission  types  and  events  the  crewmember  may  fly.    Above-Wing-Level crewmembers  who  fly  with  only  one  unit  may  receive  this  from  their  attached  unit commander. 4.5.2.2.  Above-Wing-Level  crewmembers  maintaining  BMC  status  are  exempt  from academic ground training and special training programs within authorized mission areas.  Specific currencies will be provided to the host squadron and squadron supervisors will determine crewmember qualifications to participate in squadron scenarios for MDT. 4.5.2.3.  Above-Wing-Level crewmembers will: 4.5.2.3.1.  Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy. 4.5.2.3.2.  Submit qualification and authorization documentation along with currency information to the supporting squadron supervisors prior to flying with that squadron. 4.5.2.3.3.  Evaluate  the  demands  of  each  mission  scenario  and  ensure  they  do  not exceed their ability and proficiency. 4.5.2.4.  With  the  concurrence  of  the  OG/CC,  instructor-qualified  crewmembers  may perform instructor duties provided they have qualification and currency for the applicable missions and events. 4.5.3.  Active Duty pilots flying with ANG and AFRC units: 4.5.3.1.  Wing/group  air  advisor  rated  personnel  on  duty  with  operational  training  units can maintain CMR and may be qualified as an IP and SEFE. 4.5.3.2.  Active duty pilots other than assigned advisors are authorized to fly with AFRC units IAW AFI 11-401 as supplemented. 4.5.3.3.  Pilots  on  exchange  programs  from  active  duty  units  are  authorized  mission oriented  sorties  IAW  specific  operations  plans  (OPLAN)  that  establishes  the  exchange.  SQ/CCs  may  authorize their  specific  experience  and qualification. their  participation  IAW 4.5.3.4.  HHQ  staff  pilots  may  participate  in  tactical  training  events.    Each  pilot  will present  documentation  summarizing  medical  status  (e.g.,  AF  Form  1042,  Medical Recommendation for Flying.) 4.6.  Multiple Qualifications:  (T-2) 4.6.1.  ACC/A3 may authorize qualification in more than one MDS for crewmembers when command  mission  requirements  direct  such  action  and  dual  qualification  is  economically justifiable.    MAJCOMs  cannot  delegate  this  authority.    Unless  required  for  unit  mission accomplishment,  commanders  must  not  permit  crewmembers  qualified  in  primary  mission aircraft  to  maintain  qualification  in  support  aircraft.    Individuals  assigned  to  positions   40  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 covered by paragraph 4.6.2 have prior ACC/A3 approval and do not need to submit specific requests. 4.6.1.1.  Multiple qualification requests will be submitted through command channels to ACC/A3.    All  requests  must  contain  full  justification.    Units  will  provide  multiple qualification  approval  to  the  appropriate  host  base  flight  management  office.    Flight accomplishments will not be authorized until aircraft assignment is updated in ARMS. 4.6.1.2.  Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual remains assigned to the specific position and aircraft unless rescinded by MAJCOM/A3 (ANG:  NGB/A3). 4.6.1.3.  Multiple  qualifications  are  not  appropriate  for  senior  wing  supervisors  of  units with different types of aircraft.  Wing commanders (WG/CCs) will qualify in only one of their  wing's  aircraft.    Either  the  wing  vice  commander  (WG/CV)  or  OG/CC  should qualify in another of the wing's aircraft (not the one selected by the WG/CC). 4.6.2.  SQ/CC  must  designate  in  writing  MAJCOM  approved  crewmembers  that  will maintain  multiple  qualifications  and  designate  a  primary  (CMR)  aircraft.    Crewmembers flying  the  MC-12W  will  also  be  qualified  in  the  BE-350  aircraft  in  support  of  MC-12W operations and constitutes a single qualification. 4.6.3.  OG/CC  will  determine  which  currencies/events  may  be  satisfied  in  either  MDS  and which currencies/events must be satisfied in both MDS. 4.6.3.1.  Crewmembers  qualified  in  multiple  MDS  will  fly  at  least  once  each  45/30 (EXP/INEXP)  days  in  each  aircraft;  all  other  currencies/events  are  IAW  paragraph 4.6.3, Table 4.2, Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 4.6.3.2.  Crewmembers  qualified  in  multiple  aircraft  will  satisfy  at  least  50  percent  of their  sortie  requirements  in  their  primary  aircraft.    If  CMR  in  more  than  one  MDS,  an equitable distribution (as determined by OG/CC) of sortie and event requirements will be logged. 4.6.3.3.  If dual qualified, crewmembers will fly an equitable distribution (as determined by  OG/CC)  of  emergency  patterns,  instrument  sorties,  penetrations  and  approaches  in each MDS to fill their non-RAP requirements. 4.6.4.  Crewmembers  must  complete  MDS  conversion/qualification  training  IAW  an approved syllabus. 4.7.  Currency, Recurrency and Requalification:  (T-2) 4.7.1.  Currency/Recurrency:    Table  4.2,  Table  4.3  and  Table  4.4  define  currency requirements  for  MC-12W  crewmembers.    Aircrew  members  may  not  instruct,  evaluate  or perform  any  event  in  which  they  are  not  qualified  and  current  unless  under  instructor  or supervisor supervision.  Crewmembers logging events in the BE-350 will simultaneously log MC-12W  currencies.  Both  aircraft  are  of  the  BE-350  in  nature,  with  the  same  flight instrumentation.    Therefore,  SARM  should  produce  one  profile  of  currencies  that  will encompass both BE-350 and MC-12W events; pilots will log the same events regardless the aircraft in which the event is flown. Currency may be established or updated by: AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   41  4.7.1.1.  Accomplishing  the  event  as  a  qualified  crew  member  provided  member’s currency in the event has not expired. 4.7.1.2.  Accomplishing  the  event  as  a  qualified  crew  member  under  supervision  of  a current  instructor  IAW  paragraph  1.4.4    Note:    Instructor  Pilots  are  required  to supervise the update of expired pilot currencies as required in AFI 11-202V1. 4.7.1.3.  Events  satisfactorily  performed  on  any  evaluation  may  be  used  to  establish  or update currency in that event. 4.7.1.4.  Only  MC-12W  sorties  will  count  towards  aircrew  RSTA  or  tactical  mission sortie for RAP  or look-back purposes for pilots  and sensor operators.  Tactical  Systems Operators may count BE-350 sorties towards RAP and look-back. 4.7.2.  Training  annotated  as  affecting  CMR  status  will  require  regression  to  N-CMR  until accomplishing  appropriate  training  as  specified  by  SQ/CC.    Training  identified  as  not affecting  CMR  status  does  not  require  regression  from  CMR,  although  the  deficiency  may result in grounding until completing training.  The duration of grounding and status of sortie look-back will determine the effect on CMR status. 4.7.3.  Sortie  Recurrency/Requalification.    Loss  of  sortie  currency  requires  the  following action (timing starts from first day of being non-current): 4.7.3.1.  45-90 (60-90 for Experienced) Days:  Regain sortie currency.  Supervision level is an instructor qualified and current in the sortie or event. 4.7.3.2.  91-180  Days:    Same  as  paragraph  4.7.3.1;  plus  instructor  supervised  ATD including: 4.7.3.2.1.  For  CMR  crewmembers:    Tactics,  normal,  instrument  and  emergency procedures. 4.7.3.2.2.  For BMC crewmembers:  Normal, instrument and emergency procedures. 4.7.3.2.3.  If  an  ATD  is  not  available  training  may  be  accomplished  in  an  MC-12W Mission Aircraft. 4.7.3.3.  Aircrew who have not flown as a primary crew member for more than 180-days are unqualified  and will complete all required training events  as directed  by the SQ/CC and a flight evaluation  IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MC-12WV2.  The SQ/CC may authorize a “SPOT” evaluation in the applicable non-current areas. 4.7.3.4.  Aircrew members unqualified for a period up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment or 48 months at the end of any active flying assignment must complete training in all delinquent items (as applicable), any additional training as directed by the squadron commander, and a flight evaluation. 4.7.3.5.  Unqualified 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment or 48 months at the end of any active flying assignment or greater  complete IQT/MQT formal school flying training course and a flight evaluation. 4.7.4.  Instructor  Lack  of  Ability:    Instructors  serve  solely  at  the  discretion  of  Squadron Commanders.    Instructors  should  exemplify  a  higher  level  of  performance  and  present themselves a reliable and authoritative expert in their respective duty positions.   Instructors   42  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 exhibiting substandard performance should be reviewed for suitability of continued instructor duty.  Instructors will be decertified if: 4.7.4.1.  Awarded  a  less  than  fully  qualified  grade  in  any  area  of  a  flight  evaluation regardless of overall crew position qualification. 4.7.4.2.  Failure of a qualification, EPE, or instrument examination. 4.7.4.3.  Unit  commander  deems  instructor  is  substandard,  ineffective,  or  providing incorrect procedures, technique or policy guidance. 4.7.4.4.  Decertified  instructors  may  regain  instructor  status  by  correcting  applicable deficiency and completing training and/or evaluation as specified by SQ/CC or SQ/DO. 4.8.  Regression:  (T-2) 4.8.1.  CMR and BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Look-back:  Only RAP training, pilot proficiency  sorties  and  contingency  operations  sorties  will  be  used  for  look-back.    If crewmembers  do  not  meet  look-back  requirements  throughout  the  training  cycle,  SQ/CCs may  regress  them  to  N-CMR  or  N-BMC  status,  as  applicable,  remove  them  from  a  CMR manning position, or initiate action to remove them from active flying status. 4.8.1.1.  Failure  to  meet  one  month  RAP  sortie  look-back  requires  a  review  of  the crewmember's  three  month  sortie  history.    If  the  crewmember  meets  the  three  month look-back,  the  crewmember  may,  at  SQ/CC  discretion,  remain  CMR  or  BMC,  as applicable. 4.8.1.2.  Failure to meet three month RAP sortie look-back will result in regression to N-CMR  or  N-BMC  status  as  appropriate  or  the  SQ/CC  may  place  the  crewmember  in probation status for one month.  If the SQ/CC chooses probation, the only way to remove a crewmember from probation and preserve the current status is to re-establish a 1-month look-back at the end of the probation period. (See Figure 4.1) 4.8.1.3.  CMR  and  BMC  crewmembers  regressed  to  N-CMR  or  N-BMC  for  look-back must complete a SQ/CC-approved re-certification program to return the crewmember to CMR  or  BMC  standards.    This  re-certification  program  is  developed  by  the  SQ/CC’s training  representative  to  reinstate  aircrew  members  to  CMR  status  based  on  the individuals  flying  profile.    Upon  completion  of  the  re-certification  program,  the crewmember  also  must  meet  the  subsequent  one  month  look-back  requirement  prior  to reclaiming CMR or BMC status.   Units may credit the sorties and events accomplished during the re-certification program toward the individual's total and type sortie and event requirements for the training cycle as well as for the monthly sortie requirement. 4.8.1.4.  Look-back  computations  begin the crewmember  to  BMC  or  CMR.    The  crewmember  must  maintain  one  month  look-back until establishing a three month look-back.  If a new CMR or BMC crewmember fails to meet one month look-back while establishing three month look-back, SQ/CCs may apply probation rules as described in paragraph 4.8.1.2 In addition, one month look-back starts the first full month of CMR or BMC status. following  SQ/CC  designation  of 4.8.2.  Unqualified  Crewmember  Evaluations:    Crewmembers  who  fail  a  qualification, instrument, or mission flight evaluation will be handled IAW AFI 11-202V2.  Crewmembers will regress to N-CMR or N-BMC as applicable.  These crewmembers will remain N-CMR AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   43  or  N-BMC  until  successfully  completing  required  corrective  action,  a  reevaluation  and  are re-certified by the SQ/CC. 4.8.3.  Failure to Maintain Flying Standards:  If a qualified crewmember demonstrates lack of proficiency or knowledge during CT (not related to a flight evaluation) the SQ/CC may elect to  regress  the  individual  to  N-CMR  or  N-BMC  as  applicable.    These  crewmembers  will remain N-CMR or N-BMC until successfully completing corrective action as determined by the SQ/CC, an evaluation if required and are re-certified by the SQ/CC. 4.9.  End of Cycle Requirements:  (T-2) 4.9.1.  Crewmembers who fail to complete sortie or event requirements of this volume by the end  of  the  training  cycle  may  require  additional  training  depending  on  the  type  and magnitude of the deficiency.  Refer to paragraph 4.10 for proration policy guidance.  In all cases training shortfalls will be reported IAW paragraph 1.2 4.9.2.  Crewmembers who fail to meet the total RAP sortie requirement may continue CT at CMR  or  BMC  as  determined  by  look-back.    The  SQ/CC  will  determine  if  these crewmembers require additional training. 4.9.3.  Crewmembers  who fail to  meet  non-RAP  sortie or event  requirements  may  continue CT  at  CMR  or  BMC  as  determined  by  look-back.    The  SQ/CC  will  determine  if  these crewmembers require additional training. 4.9.4.  Failure to meet RAP Sortie Requirements will result in the following: 4.9.4.1.  Regression  to  N-CMR  or  N-BMC  if  the  SQ/CC  determines  the  sortie  type deficiency  is  significant.    To  regain  CMR  or  BMC,  the  crewmember  will  complete  all deficient sortie types.  Units may count these sorties against the total requirements for the new training cycle. 4.9.4.2.  Continuation  at  CMR  or  BMC  if  the  crewmember  maintains  total  RAP  sorties and look-back and the SQ/CC deems the sortie type deficiencies insignificant. 4.10.  Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements:  (T-3) 4.10.1.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle,  the  SQ/CC  may  prorate  all  training  requirements when  duty  not  to  include  flying  (DNIF),  emergency  leaves,  non-flying  temporary  duty (TDY),  exercises,  contingency  operations,  or  direct  combat  support  preclude  training  for  a portion  of  the  training  period  (ARC:    Includes  mandatory  training  required  by  civilian employment).  Do not consider normal annual leave as non-availability.  Units may consider extended bad weather that precludes the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days as  non-availability.    ANG  and  AFRC  crewmembers  unable  to  fly  during  their  monthly availability  period  due  to  weather  may  prorate  one  month’s  portion  of  total  training  cycle RAP sorties and events.  The following guidelines apply: 4.10.1.1.  Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-availability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies. 4.10.1.2.  Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for flying (to include post-deployment comp  time) during the training cycle.  Use  Table  4.5 to  determine the number of months to be prorated based on cumulative calendar days of non-availability.   44  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 4.10.1.3.  Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next lower whole number, but no requirement shall be prorated below one. (T-2). 4.10.1.4.  Consider  newly  assigned  or  converted  crewmembers  and  crewmembers achieving CMR or BMC status after the 15th of the month to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration purposes.  Crewmembers will complete prorated RAP sorties/events in CT. 4.10.1.5.  If  IQT  is  re-accomplished,  a  crewmember’s  training  cycle  will  start  over  at  a prorated share following completion of IQT/MQT training. 4.10.1.6.  SQ/CCs  may  prorate  a  crewmember's  last  month  on  station  prior  to  departing permanent  change  of  station  (PCS)  provided  they  do  not  exceed  one  month's  proration.  Units may  consider individuals departing PCS CMR for reporting purposes for 60 days from  date of last flight,  or until  loss of CMR currency, port call date, or sign in  at  new duty station. 4.10.2.  Contingency  Operations:    Contingency  operations  can  have  a  positive  or  negative impact  on  a  unit’s  CT  program,  as  emphasis  is  on  supporting  the  actual  contingency.    A potential lack of training opportunities while deployed can place a burden on the unit, forcing it to accomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced period of time at home station.  The following proration  procedures are intended  to  provide flexibility in  accomplishing the unit’s CT program. 4.10.2.1.  Normally,  all  sorties  flown  during  contingency  operations  will  be  logged  as contingency operations sorties. 4.10.2.1.1.  Contingency  operations  sorties  may  count requirements and may be used for look-back purposes. toward  annual  RAP 4.10.2.1.2.  RAP  events  logged  during  contingency  operations  sorties  may  count toward annual RAP requirements and may be used to update currencies. 4.10.2.1.3.  Upon  relief  from  contingency  operations,  units  may  prorate  RAP  sorties and events for the period of time each individual was tasked.  Additionally, proration is authorized for deployment preparation and deployment recovery time where home station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM or by the availability of flight hours. 4.10.2.2.  As  the  training  quality  of  missions  flown  at  contingency  locations  varies considerably,  OG/CCs  are  authorized  to  allow  sorties  that  provide  valid  training  to  be logged  as  RAP  sorties.    Events  accomplished  on  these  sorties  may  count  toward  RAP event  requirements  and  these  sorties/events  cannot  be  prorated  upon  return  to  home station. 4.10.2.3.  Upon return from contingency operations, proration is computed by calculating the  sorties  to  be  prorated  for  the  entire  deployment  and  then  subtracting  the  number  of valid  RAP  sorties  as  authorized  by  the  OG/CC.    The  result  is  the  allowable  sortie proration.    Negative  numbers  equate  to  zero.    Events  will  be  pro-rated  at  SQ/CC discretion based on the events accomplished during valid RAP sorties. AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   45  Table 4.5.  Proration Allowance. Cumulative Days of Months of Proration Training Non-Availability Allowed 0 - 15 16-45 46-75 76 - 105 106 - 135 136 - 165 166 - 180 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 4.11.  Regaining CMR and BMC Status:  (T-2) 4.11.1.  If  CMR/BMC  status  is  lost  due  to  failure  to  meet  the  End-of-Cycle  flying requirements or end-of-cycle RAP event requirements, requalification is IAW paragraph 4.9 4.11.2.  If a crewmember loses CMR or BMC status due to failure to meet sortie look-back IAW  paragraph  4.8,  the  following  applies  (timing  starts  from  the  date  the  crewmember came off CMR or BMC status): 4.11.2.1.  Up  to  90  Days:    The  crewmember  must  complete  a  SQ/CC  directed  re-certification program IAW paragraph 4.8.1.3.  In addition, the crewmember must regain RAP event currencies.  The SQ/CC or SQ/DO will approve any other additional training prior to re-certification to CMR. 4.11.2.2.  91-180  Days: Standardization/Evaluation generated qualification and written examinations.   Same  as  paragraph  4.11.2.1  plus  Operations  Group 4.11.2.3.  181  Days  and  Beyond:    Accomplish  applicable  syllabus.    Sorties,  individual events,  ATDs  and  ground  training  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC  or  SQ/DO,  plus qualification  (and  tactical  if  applicable)  written  exams,  EPE  and  mission  flight evaluation.    The  individual's  training  cycle  will  start  over  at  a  prorated  share  following completion  of  the  flight  evaluation.    The  instrument  and/or  qualification  flight evaluations must be re-accomplished only if overdue.   46  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 Figure 4.1.

General:  This  chapter  outlines  pilot  and  Sensor  Operator/Tactical  Systems  Operator upgrade  training  programs  for  special  capabilities  and  qualifications.    Units  will  develop  and maintain  local  specialized  training  programs  based  on  these  guidelines.    SQ/CCs  may  tailor programs  for  individuals  based  on  previous  experience,  qualifications  and  documented performance.  These capabilities and qualifications are in  addition to core missions for the unit and may not apply to every crewmember assigned or attached to the unit. (T-3) 5.2.  Requirements:  Requirements  for  upgrade  are  listed  in  Table  5.1   Additionally, commanders  must  ensure  the  candidate  has  adequate  retainability  to  justify  the  expenditure  of resources.

TSO Instructor candidates may calculate like-mission aircraft time towards PAA time. 5.3.  Waiver  Coordination:  OG/CC  has  waiver  authority  over  upgrade  training  requirements. (T-3).   48  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 5.4.  Aircraft/Mission  Commander  (AC/MC)  Upgrade:  SQ/CCs  have  the  authority  to upgrade pilots to Aircraft/Mission Commander status IAW this regulation.  Simulator training is not required for AC upgrade. 5.5.  Instructor Upgrade: 5.5.1.  Instructor  Pilot  Upgrade  (IPUG)  /Instructor  Sensor  Operator  Upgrade  (ISOU)/and Instructor  Tactical  Systems  Operator  (ITSO)  prepares  aircrew  members  for  qualification  as an instructor in their current crew position.  Reference the current ACC MC-12W Instructor Upgrade Syllabus which outlines the instructors training program, academics course content, flying training requirements/tasks and certification procedures. 5.6.  Flight Examiner (FE) Certification:  (T-3) 5.6.1.  Commanders  will  recommend  highly  qualified  instructors  for  flight  examiner certification.    Instructors  identified  as  flight  examiner  candidates  will  possess  in-depth knowledge  of  training  and  evaluation  policies  and  procedures  and  the  ability  to  administer evaluations according to applicable Air Force Instructions. 5.6.2.  Flight examiner candidates will be trained and qualified IAW local unit directives and policies. 5.7.  Functional  Check  Flight  (FCF)  and  Operational  Check  Flight  (OCF)  Pilot Certification:  (T-3) 5.7.1.  Local upgrade guidance will be followed. 5.7.2.  Qualified  aircrew  will  be  approved  by  SQ/CC  and  annotated  on  the  letter  of  X’s document. 5.8.  Contingency and Exercise Pre-Deployment Training:  (T-3) 5.8.1.  This  training  will  be  conducted  prior  to  deploying  in  support  of  contingency operations  locations  or  combat  exercises.    The  objective  of  this  training  is  to  ensure crewmembers' ability to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. 5.8.2.  Exercises:    Units  are  responsible  for  referring  to  appropriate  exercise  plans (EXPLAN)  and  contacting  appropriate  exercise  points  of  contact  to  determine  expected mission  tasking  (COMACC  EXPLANs  include  EXPLAN  80  for  Red  and  Maple  Flags, EXPLAN 323 for Green Flag West and EXPLAN 163 for Green Flag East). 5.8.3.  Contingency  Operations:    Units  are  responsible  for  contacting  appropriate  gaining command  or  organizations  to  determine  expected  mission  tasking.    Prior  coordination ensures  unit  preparation  for  the  appropriate  tasking  and  allows  the  responding  OG/CC  to tailor spin-up training for the theater, threat and tactics for the assigned task.  The SQ/CC is then  responsible  for  implementing  spin-up  training,  prosecuting  the  required  missions  and determining  the  specific  requirements  necessary  to  reach  the  desired  level  of  proficiency.  Units  will  place  emphasis  on  training  needed  for  missions  not  accomplished  in  daily operations.  Conduct spin-up training IAW all applicable instructions. 5.8.4.  Attached and Supporting Crewmembers.  Crewmembers not assigned to the supported squadron  must  receive  spin-up  training  as  determined  by  the  supported  SQ/CC.    This requirement  applies  to  all  attached  crewmembers  (OG,  WG,  HQ  staffs,  etc.)  and  all crewmembers supporting from any other squadron (operational, test or FTU).  The objective AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   49  of  this  spin-up  training  is  to  ensure  attached  and  supporting  crewmembers  are  proficient  to conduct  all  expected  missions.    The  supported  SQ/CC  determines  the  amount  of  spin-up training  required  for  each  attached  and  supporting  crewmember  based  on  the  individual's level of proficiency, currency, qualification, experience, etc.  The supported and supporting squadron commanders will jointly agree on the administration, documentation and evaluation of required spin-up training. 5.8.5.  Ground Training:  Crewmembers may be required to complete academic training prior to  contingency  operations  or  exercises.    Units  will  brief  contingency  (or  exercise)  Special Instructions  (SPINS),  ROE  and  Command  and  Control  (C2)  procedures.    Programs  will emphasize deployment airfield capabilities, limitations, approach procedures and hazards.  In addition,  air  defenses,  area  terrain  and  weather  and  unique  operating  procedures  will  be addressed.    The  local  Weather  Flight  can  assist  with  weather-unique  training.    Local intelligence  organizations  may  assist  the  unit's  intelligence  functions  in  the  development  of threat assessments, training materials and expected collection tasking. 5.8.6.  Flying  Training:    Spin-up  training  will  be  tailored  to  ensure  all  supporting crewmembers are proficient, current and qualified in expected mission tasking. 5.8.7.  Responsibility:    OG/CCs  are  responsible  for  ensuring  all  participating  crewmembers are ready to deploy and are proficient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. 5.9.  Conversion/Difference Training:  (T-3) 5.9.1.  Conversion  qualification  is  normally  associated  with  training  between  MDSs.  Difference qualification is normally conducted when training in a different series aircraft in the same MDS.  However, when the differences between series are great enough, the training is  considered  conversion  training  that  requires  completion  of  the  formal  school  initial qualification course.  Wing commanders will determine when conversion training is required within the same MDS.  For unit conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle  the  throughput,  MAJCOMs  will  develop  and  coordinate  with  the  training  command in-unit training plans that maximize use of highly experienced personnel as the instructors. 5.9.2.  Difference training (DT) for instructors is usually conducted under the supervision of  engineering specialists (usually coordinated through program office officials) responsible for improving  the  MC-12W  system  (e.g.  new  engines,  baseline  upgrades,  major  software changes, etc.). 5.9.3.  TSOs  are  authorized  Conversion/Difference  Training to  facilitate  Universal Qualification across like-mission aircraft.  TSO Difference Training is an instructor-certified event  and  will  be  conducted  IAW  the  MAJCOM-approved  Difference  Training  Syllabus.  Upon completion of this in-unit training, aircrew members will accomplish the unit’s written mission  qualification  examination.    Certify  crewmembers  using  the  AF  Form  4348,  USAF Aircrew Certifications or AF Form 1381, USAF Certification Of Air Crew Training. 5.9.3.1.  Universal  Qualified  crewmembers  will  comply  with  the  continuation  training events outlined in the AFI 11-2MDS, Vol. 1, for which they are primarily assigned.  As long  as  the  crewmember  maintains  CMR  status  in  their  primary  aircraft,  they  can maintain universal qualification in additional like-mission aircraft.   50  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 5.9.3.2.  Universal Qualified crewmembers who have not flown their non-primary aircraft within 60 days require instructor supervision to regain currency. 5.10.  Initial  Cadre:  The  following  conditions  apply qualification: (T-3) to  management  of initial  cadre 5.10.1.  A nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) will be formed to begin aircrew upgrades.    Initial cadre  will not  be designated in  a  crew position higher than currently held unless previously qualified.  The host unit providing training will document all DT  and  maintain  the  training  folder  until  successful  completion  of  the  upgrade  program.  Initial  cadre  crewmembers  are  responsible  for  completing  recommended  training  on  any equipment, systems, or crew procedures which differ from that in the MDS they are currently qualified. 5.10.2.  The OG/CC (or equivalent) will determine which training events are applicable after examining the training and evaluation records of initial cadre and determine if a certification is  applicable  or  whether  a  qualification  evaluation  (check  ride)  is  required.    OG/CC  may require  crewmembers  to  complete  a  written  examination  prior  to  unsupervised  flight  when emergency  procedures  have  changed;  even  if  an  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew Qualification,  flight  evaluation  is  not  required.    A  copy  of  proposed  training  qualification plan will be forwarded to MAJCOM OPR when training requires a flight evaluation. 5.11.  Qualifications  and  Certifications:  Aircrew  qualifications  are  attained through evaluations and documented on the AF FORM 8 or 8a, as applicable.  Aircrew certifications are attained through methods other than evaluation (e.g. instruction and instructor certified events or commander certifications) and may be documented on the AF FORM 1381, AF FORM 4348 or appropriate training records/folder or in ARMS. (T-2) 5.11.1.  The commander will select those aircrew members qualified in the unit’s mission to maintain additional special qualifications/certifications.  Special qualification is gained with a  flight  evaluation  (for  special  qualifications)  or  an  instructor  certification.    Qualifications requiring evaluations will be documented  IAW AFI 11-2MC-12WV2.  Special certification events are obtained by instructor supervised/administered training and proficiency training in the  required  tasks/event(s).    Upon  completion  of  the  required  task  proficiency  level  the certifying instructor will be annotated in  the crewmember’s training folder and on AF  IMT 1381.    During  MQT  training,  if  syllabus  resources  allow  and  student  is  able  to  complete  a special  qualification  or  instructor-certified  event  within  the  normal  syllabus  without detracting  from  developing  core  skills,  the  special  qualification  may  be  annotated  on  the MQT Form 8.  Instructors are authorized to teach any special qualifications in which they are qualified and current unless specifically restricted. 5.11.2.  Aircraft/Mission Commander Touch-and-Go Certification Program: 5.11.2.1.  Aircraft/Mission Commander Touch-and-Go Landings: 5.11.2.1.1.  Training  Program:   The  squadron  commander  is  responsible  for developing  a  certification  program  allowing  Aircraft/Mission  Commanders  the opportunity to practice this skill without IP supervision. 5.11.2.1.2.  Training  Requirements:    The  trainee  will  receive  a  minimum  of  one  IP-supervised  sortie.    The  trainee  will  perform  a  minimum  of  one  and  supervise  a AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   51  minimum  of  three  touch-and-go  landings  which  can  be  accomplished  in  either  seat.  The pre-brief for this sortie will include emphasis on procedures, common mistakes, abort decisions, and restrictions. 5.11.2.1.3.  Certification:    Document  certification  via  AF  Form  4324  (ARMS  event identifier Q050) or by an approved letter of X’s document signed by the Sq/CC. 5.11.2.2.  Certified  pilots  should  alternate  right  and  left  seats  when  maintaining proficiency/currency.

All active duty API-1/2’s, Squadron Commander, Operations Officers and OG/CC designated API-6 manning positions are required to maintain this qualification level.  EXCEPTION:  If a unit is over-manned, they may elect to train the front line of their UMD to CMR with the overage designated as BMC. Composite  Force  Training  (CFTR)—Scenarios  employing  multiple  flights  of  the  same  or different types of aircraft, each under the direction of its own flight leader, performing the same or different roles.  (AFI 11-214)   68  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 Continuation  Training  (CT)—Training to maintain proficiency and improve pilot capabilities to  perform  unit  missions  and  pilot  proficiency  sorties  not  flown  in  formal  syllabus  missions, tests, or evaluations.  Applicable to CMR and BMC pilots. Conversion  Training—Training  required  when  units  (or  individual  crewmembers)  are converting between MDS (i.e. C-12 to MC-12W).  Conversion training is normally done through formal training courses;  however MAJCOMs may  develop  in-unit training when formal school courses are not available.  In-unit training plans should maximize the use of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre. Currency—Minimum frequency required to perform an event or sortie safely. Delivery  Parameters—Data  reflecting  current  delivery  considerations  for  general  purpose ordnance  as  well  as  tactical  survivability.    Appropriate  aircraft/  weapons  Tech  Orders  must  be consulted for live ordnance safe escape criteria and -1 performance charts for recovery altitudes. Difference  Training—Training  required  when  new  systems/hardware  come  online  which represent  significant  changes  from  current  configurations.    Initial  cadre  instructors  completing difference training may provide training to other unit aircrew members at home station. Emergency  Procedures  Evaluation—An  evaluation  of  crewmember  knowledge  and responsiveness to critical and non-critical EPs conducted by a SEFE in an ATD, or the GCS.

NVG  Academic  Refresher  Training—IAW  AFI  11-202V1,  all  NVG  qualified  crewmembers will  accomplish  NVG  refresher  training  IAW  MAJCOM-developed  courseware.    When  such AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   69  products  are  not  available,  units  may  develop  an  NVG  refresher  training  program  based  on  a review  of  initial  NVG  academic  courseware.    The  content  and  extent  of  this  review  should  be tailored  to  the  MC-12W  mission  environment.    At  the  discretion  of  the  unit  commander,  a portion of this training may be completed with the Air Force Research Laboratory Night Vision Goggle  Refresher  Course  for  Tanker  and  Transport  Aircraft  and  may  credit  the  NVG  ground training  requirement.    The  Night  Vision  Goggle  Refresher  Course  for  Tanker  and  Transport Aircraft provides an excellent refresher on NVG use, limitations, adjustment procedures, lighting issues/compatibility,  weather/environmental  effects  and  hazards/shortfalls  of  NVGs.    At  least some  portion  of  the  training  must  be  completed  through  a  guided  lecture/discussion  led  by  a qualified NVG instructor.  Aircrew members overdue  for NVG refresher training  are restricted from  NVG  flight  until  this  training  is  completed.            Note:    Units  may  obtain  the  above mentioned  training  courseware  by  calling  the  Night  Vision  Program  office  at  the  Air  Force Research Laboratory (AFRLL/HEA), DSN 474-6561, extension 478. Operational  Flight  Trainer  (OFT)—A  training  device  which  dynamically  simulates  flight characteristics.    Used  for  normal,  emergency  and  instrument  procedures,  to  include  safety  of flight, warfighting tasks and skill integration training (see AFH 36-2235V7) Primary  Aircraft  Inventory  (PAI)—Aircraft  assigned  to  meet  the  Primary  Aerospace Authorization 9PAA).  The PAI forms the basis for allocation of operating resources to include manpower,  support  equipment  and  flying-hour  funds.    The  operating  command  determines  the PAI  required  to  meet  their  assigned  missions.    (See  AFI  16-402,  Aerospace  Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting and Termination.) Primary  Aerospace  Vehicle  Authorization  (PAA)—-  The  number  of  aircraft  authorized  to  a unit for performance of its operational mission. The primary authorization forms the basis for the allocation  of  operating  resources  to  include  manpower,  support  equipment,  and  flying-hour funds. Proficiency—Demonstrated  ability  to  successfully  accomplish  tasked  event  safely  and effectively.    For  purposes  of  this  volume,  proficiency  also  requires  currency  in  the  event,  if applicable. Special  Departure  Procedures—An IMC procedure designed to allow increased takeoff gross weight  for  multi-engine  aircraft  whose  OEI  climb  rate  would  otherwise  not  meet  the requirements  stated  in  AFI11-202V3  paragraph  8.7.2.    The  runway  and  all  obstacles  along  a chosen  takeoff  path  are  analyzed  and  compared  to  the  aircraft  OEI  takeoff  and  climb performance.  The  procedure  provides  a  maximum  allowable  takeoff  gross  weight  for  given performance  conditions  that  ensure  vertical  and  lateral  obstacle  clearance  safety  margins.  The minimum allowable gross and net climb gradients for SDPs are typically lower than TERPS, the takeoff  path  is  selected  to  minimize  obstacle  clearance  requirements  and  only  those  obstacles within  the  lateral  limits  of  the  chosen  flight  path  are  considered.  The  term  SDP  encompasses both the use of the textual obstacle data information and the graphical departure procedures. Specialized  Training—Training flight responsibilities such as flight  lead, instructor,  LASDT, etc.  This  training  may be conducted in MQT or CT, as required. tactics,  weapons  systems,  or in  specialized Squadron Supervisor—Squadron Commander, Operations Officers (DO), Assistant Operations Officers  (ADO)  and  others  designated  in  writing  by  the  SQ/CC.    Except  for  SQ/CC,  DO  and   70  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 ADO,  appointment  must  be  endorsed  by  OG/CC  and  qualification  will  be  documented  on  unit letter of X’s. Training Cycle—The standard ACC RAP training cycle is aligned with a unit’s 20-month AEF cycle.  However, MC-12W units are considered Low-Supply/High-Demand (LSHD) and are not aligned  against  a  specific  AEF  pair.    Therefore,  the  RAP  training  period  is  aligned  with  a  12-month cycle, in order to best prepare for high operations tempo outside the normal  AEF cycle.  Units  will  reference  their  MAJCOM  RAP  tasking  message  for  specified  training  cycle  and reporting procedures.  Units and individual crewmembers will complete all training requirements within  the  appropriate  training  cycle  unless  specifically  accepted  by  this  instruction  or  HHQ guidance. Verification—Applies  to  procedure  aimed  at  verifying  and  refreshing  aircrew  employment knowledge, emphasizing conventional operations and mobile targets.  Verification is conducted in  both  initial  and  follow-on  phases.    Initial  verification  phase  is  a  formal  board  proceeding convened to verify individual aircrew knowledge.  Continuation training is to reinforce, refresh and update aircrews on unit wartime mission/tasking, tactics and procedures. Visual  Identification  (VID)—(DoD,  NATO)    In  a  flight  control  system,  a  control  mode  in which  the  aircraft  follows  a  radar  target  and  is  automatically  positioned  to  allow  visual identification. Weapons  Delivery—Simulated or actual expenditure of air-to-ground munitions representing a typical combat configuration or SCL in a tactical scenario.  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   71  GLOSSARY OF MISSION/SORTIE AND EVENT DEFINITIONS Attachment 2 A2.1.  Sortie and Mission Definitions. A2.1.1.  Sortie.  The operational nature of MC-12W requires clarification of the term sortie within  the  scope  of  this  AFI.    An  MC-12W  flight  is  defined  as  initial  takeoff  until  the  full stop landing.  A sortie, for documenting events accomplished, is the portion of the flight in which an individual crewmember is performing his or her assigned duties.  For the purposes of this instruction the terms mission and sortie are synonymous. A2.1.2.  Logging  Sorties.    Normally,  aircrew  members  will  not  log  more  than  one  type  of sortie on a single flight. See A2.2.1.1 for exceptions. A2.2.  Flying training definitions. A2.2.1.  Total RAP Sortie (SR00) - Oriented to developing basic combat skills or practicing tactical employment simulating conditions anticipated in the unit mission.  A counter which includes  any  RAP  sortie  which  include  Pilot  Proficiency  Sorties  (SR70),    Reconnaissance, Surveillance  and  Target  Acquisition  Sortie  (SR43)  and  Tactical  Mission  (SR01).  This counter is incremented automatically, so aircrew need not log. A2.2.1.1.  Mission  Sortie  (SR04)  -  A  counter  which  includes  any  mission  sortie  which include   Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition Sortie (SR43) and Tactical Mission (SR01). This counter is incremented automatically, so aircrew need not log. A2.2.1.2.  Pilot  Proficiency  Sortie  (PPS,  SR70)    –  Pilot  Proficiency  Sortie  (PPS).  Crews must maintain a high level of proficiency with basic aircraft flight procedures.  A PPS  is  a  mission  to  practice  instrument,  transition,  traffic  patterns  and  emergency procedures.  Maneuvers will be flown under the direct supervision of an IP.  An IP should log a PPS with  IP supervision, when possible.  IPs and EPs are not required to fly with another IP to credit this event.  All maneuvers will be completed to an acceptable level of proficiency  as  determined  by  the  IP  to  log  the  PPS.   Should  the  PPS  be incomplete  for weather,  aircraft  malfunction,  or  pilot  performance,  the  instructor  will  determine  if  the entire  PPS  will  be  re-accomplished  or  just  the  incomplete  events.    Instructors  need  not accomplish all the events on a single sortie.  The PPS will be credited upon completion of the last event.  A PPS should be briefed as a standard alternate mission. Pilots may dual log  a  PPS  (SR70)  with  a  mission  sortie  (SR01,  SR43),  if  the  requirements  for  both  are met. A PPS should consist of the following: A2.2.1.2.1.  Two  instrument  approaches  (one  precision  and  one  non-precision  if available). A2.2.1.2.2.  A holding pattern or procedure turn. A2.2.1.2.3.  Simulated engine-out approach, go-around and landing. A2.2.1.2.4.  A Circling Approach (traffic permitting). A2.2.1.2.5.  VFR traffic pattern (weather permitting). A2.2.1.2.6.  Landings at all flap settings prescribed by the flight manual.   72  AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015 A2.2.1.2.7.  A review of CAPs . A2.2.1.3.

Unless A counter which includes any non-RAP sortie (SXxx). This counter is incremented automatically, so aircrew need not log. A2.1.3.  Non-RAP Sortie specifically tasked, there is no requirement to log non-RAP sorties. A2.2.4.  Basic  Non-RAP  Sortie  (SX03)  -  A  sortie  flown  in  the  BE-350  or  MC-12  where few, if any mission elements are accomplished. A2.2.5.  Instructor/Evaluator  Sortie  (SX09)  –  A  sortie  in  which  a  crewmember  is designated  on  the  flight  authorization  as  an  instructor  or  evaluator  and  accomplishes instruction/evaluation in flight but did not occupy a primary crew position. A2.2.6.  Total  Collateral  Sortie  (SC00)  -  A  counter  which  includes  any  collateral  sortie (SCxx). This counter is incremented automatically, so aircrew need not log. A2.2.7.  Ferry Flight (SC02) – Sortie delivering an aircraft, aircrew, or equipment from one location to another. Example: BUSY RELAY. A2.2.8.  Attrition  Sortie  (SC13) – A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training sortie, Non-RAP  sortie,  or  collateral  sortie,  that,  due  to  some  circumstance  (weather,  IFE, maintenance,  etc.),  fails  to  accomplish  the  planned  mission.  It  is  imperative  that  units  log these  sorties  properly.  Improper  accounting  of  these  sorties  will  result  in  improper  sortie allocation,  stresses  to  the  unit  schedule  and  negative  impacts  to  the  quality  of  unit  training programs. AFI11-2MC-12WV1  17 JULY 2015   73  A2.2.9.
