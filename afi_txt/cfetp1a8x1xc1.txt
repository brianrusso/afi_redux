Previously printed versions of the CFETP dated 1 March 2014 may be updated with the below write-in changes.    1.  Write-in changes:   Page 14-15 Task  Column Action 6.1.2. Unless otherwise directed, the DLPT or OPI is the primary method for testing language proficiency. All SMSgt and below ACLAs, to include DLI by-pass ACLAs, must test annually for currency in their CAFSC language unless they score L3/R3 or better.  Those who score L3/R3 or better are only required to test every two years.  (“Annually” is defined as one year from the first day of the first month after the most recent currency month.)  Additionally, CLAs whose currency expires due to a contingency deployment or TDY of 30 days or more shall be afforded up to 120 days to re-obtain currency upon their return, unless the TDY is for a Significant Language Training Event (SLTE). A CLA returning from a SLTE TDY whose currency expired during the TDY may be afforded up to 30 days to re-obtain currency upon their return.  ACLAs failing to test within the required timeframe will be considered sub-proficient and entered into UNCLASSIFIED RLTP.  Although not required, ACLAs are highly encouraged to test in any other language for which they possess a capability.  ARC Guard and Reserve ACLAs are only required to test annually in the language assigned in their current duty position (or every two years if they score L3/R3 or better), though they are welcome to test in other languages.
