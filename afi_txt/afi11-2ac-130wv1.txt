Coordinate  with  servicing  Military  Personnel  Flight  (MPF)  to  ensure  the individual acknowledges any Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) or Reserve Duty Service Commitment (RDSC) required for in-unit upgrade training and this ADSC/RDSC is properly processed once training is complete (see Paragraph 1.5, this instruction). AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015   11  1.3.10.  The Instructor  will: 1.3.10.1.  Be  thoroughly  familiar  with  all  courseware  and  contents  of  the  applicable attachments to this instruction for qualification, upgrade, and specialized training they are required to administer.  (T-3) 1.3.10.2.  Review the student’s training records prior to performing each flight or training session.  (T-3) 1.3.10.3.  Conduct thorough preflight briefing and postflight critique. (T-3) 1.3.10.4.  Ensure  all  required  upgrade  training  items  are  completed  and  signed  off  only after  the  student  demonstrates  the  required  level  of  knowledge  and  proficiency.  (T-3)  Complete and sign off all required training items prior to recommending the student for an evaluation or certifying the student in a  maneuver or procedure. 1.3.10.5.  Be  responsible  for  the  safe  execution  of  the  duties  of  their  respective  crew position.    At  any  time  during  the  flight,  if  the  judgment  or  proficiency  of  the  student should raise a question in the instructor’s mind as to the student’s ability to safely execute the duties of the aircrew position, the instructor will immediately take over these duties.  The instructor should then explain and demonstrate the proper method of executing these duties.    (T-3)    In  order  to  provide  effective  instruction  concerning  weapons  system employment,  instructors  are  thoroughly  knowledgeable  in  AC-130W  TTPs,  governing AFIs,  regulatory  guidance,  and  other  materials  such  as  applicable  manufacturers’ publications. 1.3.10.6.  As  an  instructor  pilot,  be  responsible  at  all  times  for  the  conduct  of  the  flight and safety of the aircraft.  At any time during the flight, if the judgment or proficiency of the  student  at  the  controls  raises  a  question  in  the  instructor  pilot’s  mind  as  to  the student’s  ability  to  safely  complete  a  prescribed  maneuver,  the  instructor  pilot  will immediately  take  over  the  controls  of  the  aircraft.    The  instructor  pilot  should  then explain and demonstrate proper methods of conducting the maneuver prior to the student resuming  control  of  the  aircraft.    (T-3)    All  instructors    place  special  emphasis  on  the procedures for positive identification of emergency conditions before initiating corrective action.        In  addition,  instructors  thoroughly  brief  and  place  a  high  emphasis  on  the procedures for positive exchange of control. 1.3.10.7.  If  an  instructor  demonstrates  deficiencies  in  their  instructional  abilities  they may  be  used  in  their  primary  crew  position  (provided  a  deficiency  does  not  involve primary  crew  duties).    Commanders  will  take  the  necessary  action  to  either  retrain  or remove those individuals from instructor status IAW Air Force or MAJCOM directives.   (T-3) 1.3.10.8.  Be  authorized  to  instruct  at  all  levels  of  qualification.    Instructors  are authorized to teach any event in which they are qualified and current unless specifically restricted. 1.3.11.  Individual Aircrew Member Responsibilities: 1.3.11.1.  As  part  of  PCS,  hand-carry  training  folder  and  other  training  records  to  assist gaining  unit’s  assessment  of  member’s  qualifications  and  additional training requirements.   12  AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015 1.3.11.2.  When  attending  a  formal  school  course,  hand  carry  a  copy  of  Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) Individual Data Summary, flying history report, individual  training  summary,  aeronautical  orders,  aviation  service  worksheet,  and  any additional requirements set forth in the ETCA to the training squadron aviation resource management office. 1.3.11.3.  Participate  only  in  ground  and  flying  activities  for  which  they  are  qualified, current, and adequately prepared. 1.4.  Aircrew Training Policy.  The primary training method for AC-130W initial qualification or  upgrade  training  is  attendance  at  an  ETCA  formal  school.  USAF  policy  dictates  the  use  of formal schools unless attendance is impractical.  The secondary method is in-unit training using applicable  formal  school  courseware.    Requalification  training  is  accomplished  IAW  AFI  11-202, Vol 1 1.4.1.  Secondary  Method  Training  (SMT).    Secondary  Method  Training  (SMT)  requires  a waiver  be  submitted  through  appropriate  channels  per  this  instruction  and  approved  by MAJCOM/A3T.  Any aircrew member who was previously disenrolled from a formal ETCA course  for  substandard  performance  is  ineligible  for  Secondary  Method  Training.    Aircrew members  (primary  or  supervisory)  must  complete  SMT  within  180  calendar  days  from  the date  of  their  first  ground  training  session  or  first  flight,  whichever  occurs  first.    (T-2) Individuals start training within 45 calendar days of waiver approval.  Individuals unable  to complete training within these limits may continue training; however, their units will notify AFSOC/A3T with a description of the difficulty and expected completion date (not to exceed an  additional  120  calendar  days).    (T-2)  If  SMT  is  not  completed  by  this  date,  any  further extension requires AFSOC/A3 approval.  Commanders ensure aircrew personnel engaged in qualification or requalification training complete their training in a timely and uninterrupted manner.    Duties  not  directly  related  to  qualification  or  requalification  training  should  be minimized. Upon completion of SMT training, units will notify AFSOC/A3T using the SMT Completion Memo.  (T-2) SMT Waiver and SMT Completion templates are available on the AFSOC/A3TA website, https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TA/Templates/Forms/AllItems.aspx. Sharepoint 1.4.1.1.  Formal  courseware  requests.    The  551  SOS  is  the  primary  source  for  formal training  products.    When  specific  formal  courseware  is  not  published,  use  of  locally developed training syllabi is authorized.  Units will forward all locally developed syllabi for in-unit training to AFSOC/A3T for review and approval.  (T-2) All locally approved in- unit syllabi are posted on the AFSOC/A3T web page.  For SMT requests, the waiver authority  (per  Table  1.1)  includes  the  appropriate  formal  school  (551  SOS)  as  an addressee  on  all  correspondence  and  requests  that  the  formal  school  forward  applicable courseware to the aircrew member’s unit of assignment.  Courseware includes but is not limited  to;  the  course  syllabus,  briefings,  Computer  Based  Training  (CBT)  modules, student  and  instructor  guides,  and  training  guides  and  grade  sheets  for  the  student’s training  folder.    The  unit  training  office  will  verify  the  current  version  is  used.    (T-2) (Note:  Formal  schools  will  not  forward  written  examinations  as  part  of  the  courseware for in-unit qualification training).  (T-2) 1.4.1.2.  Complete  all  academic,  ground,  and  flight  training  outlined  in  the  courseware.  When    the  courseware  is  adapted  for  local  use,  modify  it  only  if  the  training    is AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015   13  incompatible with local training conditions (e.g. simulator not available).  Students may proficiency  advance  (PA)  provided  all  required  proficiency  levels  (RPLs)  are  met  or exceeded  for  the  advanced  (skipped)  sortie(s)/lesson(s).    The  SQ/DO  is  the  approval authority for proficiency advancement. 1.4.1.2.1.  Syllabus Waivers. A syllabus waiver is a planned one-time exception to the syllabus  used  to  enhance  or  accommodate  student  training  in  special  or  unusual circumstances.    Syllabus  waivers  are  not  intended  to  be  permanent  changes  to  a syllabus,  but  should  be  suggested  as  syllabus  changes  if  a  permanent  change  is warranted.    AFSOC/A3T  is  the  approval  authority  for  syllabus  waivers.    Submit syllabus  waiver  requests  in  writing,  including  the  rationale  for  the  waiver  using  a memorandum  for  record.    All  waiver  requests  are  routed  through  SOG/CC,  who forwards  it  to  AFSOC/A3T.    AFSOC/A3T  will  approve  or  disapprove  requests  and forward  a  copy  of  approved  waivers  to  SOG/CC  and  the  appropriate  gaining  unit training office.  SOGs will maintain a record of all approved waivers for two  years.  (T-2)  Training  requested  in  a  syllabus  waiver  may  not  commence  until  waiver approval is obtained. 1.4.1.2.2.  Syllabus Deviations.  A syllabus deviation is any unplanned variation from syllabus  or  equivalent  directed  requirement  such  as  prerequisite  flow,  turn  times, landing  currency,  minimum  number  of  events,  etc.    Unless  a  waiver  request  is approved  prior  to  beginning  of  training,  all  syllabus  training  is  accomplished.    If unforeseen circumstances result in an omission of required training, the SQ/DO will determine  if  the  omitted  training  can  be  accomplished  later  in  the  syllabus  flow, without  adversely  affecting  the  quality  of  student  training.    (T-3)  Document  all syllabus  deviations,  SQ/DO  directed  corrective  actions,  and  accomplishment  of  the omitted training in the student’s training folder.  However, on a case-by-case basis the SQ/DO may authorize an intentional syllabus deviation in the interest of flying safety.  All syllabus deviations are documented and maintained in the student training folder. 1.4.1.3.  MAJCOM  approved  differences  training  may  be  conducted  in  unit  without  a waiver. 1.4.1.4.  Units conducting training where a waiver is not required (i.e., complete training for  restricted  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification,  MAJCOM  approved differences training) will send a request for any applicable courseware through channels to  MAJCOM/A3T,  with  an  information  copy  to  the  appropriate  formal  school.    (T-2) Include unit point of contact (name, rank, office symbol, and telephone number) and the name and rank of the trainee. 1.4.2.  Training  Forms.    Aircrew  training  records  and  forms  are  established  and  maintained per AFI 11-202, Vol 1 AFSOC Supplement. 1.4.2.1.  AF  Form  4348,  USAF  Aircrew  Certifications  are  used to  document ground/flying training associated with  mission qualification, and to document instructor certified and one-time/initial flying training events.  The AF Form 4348 is maintained in the  individual’s  Flight  Evaluation  Folder  (FEF)  per  AFI  11-202,  Vol  2,  Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. 1.4.2.2.  The following forms aid management of aircrew training programs.   14  AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015 1.4.2.2.1.  AF  Form  4109,  SOF/CSAR  Aircrew  Training  Record,  is  used  as  the training  record  jacket  to  document  in-unit  qualification  or  upgrade  of  an  aircrew member.  It documents applicable ground training, special function training, part task training,  cockpit  procedures  training,  simulator  training,  and  flying  training accomplished by crewmembers. 1.4.2.2.2.  AF  Form  4110,  Comments  –SOF/CSAR  Training  Record,  is  used  to document narrative comments on aircrew training activities. 1.4.2.2.3.  AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training Record, is used to list RPL, indicate events for training sortie completion, and to document demonstrated student task and subtask  performance  and  knowledge  proficiency  levels.    Units  are  authorized  to overprint and reproduce AF Form 4111 for approved course syllabi.  The number of training  tasks  in  the  appropriate  training  guide  is  a  recommended  minimum,  which normally allows the student to achieve proficiency. It is neither intended to restrict the number of times the task is accomplished nor restrict proficiency advancement. 1.4.2.3.  IAW  the  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP),  personnel  in  Air Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC)  1AXXX  are  exempt  from  maintaining  OJT  Training Folders (AF Form 623). 1.4.2.4.  For Weapons Instructor Course (WIC), prepare training records IAW USAFWS guidance. 1.4.3.  Aircrew  Training  While  DNIF.    Crewmembers  whose  status  is  “duty  not  involving flying” (DNIF) may log ground training events, including simulator training, if their physical   Consult  the  flight  surgeon  initiating  AF  Form  1042,  Medical condition  allows. Recommendation For Flying or Special Operational Duty, action if the DNIF status includes ground training limitations. 1.4.4.  In-flight  Supervision.    Unless  specifically  directed,  the  unit  commander  determines the level of supervision necessary to accomplish required training.  If the mission objectives include  introduction  to  tasks  or  instruction  to  correct  previous  discrepancies,  then  an instructor may be required.  The following personnel are supervised by an instructor from a like crew position when performing aircrew duties. 1.4.4.1.  Non-current crewmembers. 1.4.4.2.  Crewmembers in initial, difference, upgrade, or requalification flying training. 1.4.4.3.  Senior  officers  who  have  not  completed  initial  qualification  as  outlined  in Chapter 2 and in Paragraph 1.7. 1.4.5.  Cross Crew Position Training (CCPT).  With unit commander, operations officer,  or mission  commander  approval,  instructors  from  one  crew  position  may  train  crewmembers from a different crew position on specific skills/events in which both are qualified (as long as the instructor is not performing duties as a primary crewmember at the time) unless otherwise restricted  in  this  volume.    Flight  evaluations  comply  with  requirements  of  AFI  11-2AC- 130W, Vol 2 (or equivalent), Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. 1.5.  Service  Commitments.  Formal  training,  either  primary  or  secondary  method,  conducted per  this  instruction  may  incur  a  service  commitment  IAW  AFI  36-2107,  Active  Duty  Service Commitments  (ADSC).    Reference  the  appropriate  AFI  for  program  specifics.  Individuals  will AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015   15  acknowledge  the  incurred  SC  by  signing  the  appropriate  Active  Duty  Service  Commitment Acknowledgement  Statement,  prior  to  entering  training.    (T-3)  The  unit  training  officer  will notify  AFPC/DPSFO  via  the  servicing  Military  Personnel  Flight  (MPF)  once  training  is complete. (T-2) 1.6.  Waivers:  AF/A35  is  the  waiver  authority  for  training  requirements  specified  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol.  1.  This  authority  has  been  delegated  to  MAJCOM/A3  for  specific  aircrew  training events  (case  by  case  basis).    These  requirements  currently  include  initial  CRM  training,  initial life  support  equipment  and  procedures  training,  Survival  Evasion  Resistance  Escape  (SERE), flight evaluations, and egress training (see AFI 11-202, Vol 1 for specific guidance).  For case- by-case training  currencies, AFSOC/SGP  and  AFMSA/SGPA  are  the  respective  waiver  authorities.  Some  ground  training items (e.g. small arms training, LOAC, etc.) are tasked by other agencies. Reference the source instruction  to  determine  the  waiver  authority  in  these  cases.    MAJCOM/A3  is  the  waiver authority  for  MDS-specific  Vol  1  aircrew  training  requirements  unless  otherwise  noted  in  this AFI.

Waiver format templates are available on the website,  https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TA/default.aspx. AFSOC/A3TA Sharepoint 1.6.3.  Units  requesting  waivers  for  SMT  in-unit  qualification,  mission  qualification,  or upgrade  of  an  aircrew  member  will  send  requests  through  appropriate  channels  to MAJCOM/A3T.  (T-2)  Formal schools will forward current copies of courseware materials to  units  semi-annually.    (T-2)  Maintain  copies  of  all  waivers  in  the  individual’s  training folder. If the training incurs an ADSC per Paragraph 1.5, include the statement “Individual acknowledged  receipt  of  ADSC  by  signing  the  AF  Form  63,  Acitve  Duty  Service Commitment Acknowledgement Statement, on (date AF Form 63 signed)”. 1.6.4.  Operations Group commander or equivalent (e.g. CJSOAC/CC) may: 1.6.4.1.  Waive 10 percent of the Total and PAA hours in Tables 5.1 and 5.2 required for upgrade in all crew positions, on an individual basis only.  A copy of the waiver is filed in the individual’s training record.  Students attending formal school will bring a waiver letter to the formal school for insertion into their training record.  (T-2) 1.6.4.2.  Extend ground training requirement due dates up to 2 months for Note 1 events in  the  RTM  ground  training  table  on  an  individual  basis  only  (Exception:  Events referenced in Paragraph 1.6 levied by other AFIs may not be waived by the OG unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI).  These events may count towards the next periodic requirements (units should note on waiver when events were accomplished and the ARMS due date should be updated). 1.6.4.3.  Extend  due  dates  for  RTM  ground  training  table  events  on  an  individual  basis for the duration of an exercise, contingency or operational mission only if a crewmember goes  overdue  while  away  from  home  station  and  the  training  is  not  available  at  the deployed location. Exception: Events referenced in Paragraph 1.6 levied by other AFIs may not be waived by the OG unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI. 1.6.4.4.  Waive  all  flying  training  requirements  (RTM  BAQ  and  MR  tables  except  as otherwise noted) on an individual basis only.  Wings/groups must keep an accurate record of waivers granted.  (T-2)  Notify MAJCOM/A3T when waivers are issued. 1.6.5.  Unit commanders may carry new crewmembers as “mission ready” (MR) for up to six months if an aircrew member arrives at the unit after a PCS or formal school and is not MR in  all  core  mission  events.    Under  no  circumstance  may  crewmembers  perform  events  in which they are not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. This policy does not apply to basic aircraft qualification events.  If training is not complete in six months, the aircrew member becomes “non-mission ready” (NMR).  OG commanders may authorize extensions. Units must notify MAJCOM/A3T of any OG extensions.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015   17  1.6.6.  MAJCOM/A3  will  specify  via  RTM  the  time  an  aircrew  member  is  trained  and qualified  when  a  new  core  mission  event  is  added.    If  training  is  not  complete  within  that time,  the  aircrew  member  becomes  “non-mission  ready”  (NMR).    OG  commanders  may authorize extensions. Units must notify MAJCOM/A3T of any OG extensions.  (T-2) 1.7.  Senior Officer Flying/Supervisory Aircrew.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 1, AFSOC SUP. 1.8.  Intra-command and Inter-command Transfer of Aircrews.  For intra-command transfer of  aircrew  members,  the  gaining  organization  honors  validated  training  completed  by  newly assigned  crewmembers  prior  to  the  transfer.    For  inter-command  transfer,  certifications  and qualifications  should  be  accepted  to  the  maximum  extent  practical,  as  long  as  training  and evaluation standards are equivalent.  The operations officer at the gaining unit should review the individual's  career  training  folder  and  flight  evaluation  folder  to  determine  which  certifications and qualifications are honored.  (T-2) 1.8.1.  Permanent  Change  of  Station  (PCS)  Screening.    Losing  units  will  screen  individual flight  and  ground  training  records  during  unit  out-processing.    (T-2)    Accomplish  this screening in sufficient time to correct discrepancies prior to PCS.  Losing unit will provide a printed  copy  of  current  ground  and  flying  training  summaries  to  individuals  prior  to  PCS.  (T-2)  See AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, for additional guidance. 1.8.2.  Instructor training and qualifications may be accepted at the discretion of the gaining unit commander. 1.9.  Initial  Cadre  for  Change  of  Aircraft,  Equipment,  or  Capability.  When  possible, qualified personnel in other units operating like equipment will  provide the initial cadre.  (T-2)  In some instances, it is necessary for units converting from one design aircraft to another to form an initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification requirements may be waived.  Authorization to form initial cadre crews is contained in the conversion program action directive.    Unless  otherwise  stated  in  the  program  action  directive,  the  following  conditions  apply to management of initial cadre aircrew qualification for aircraft conversion: 1.9.1.  A  nucleus  of  instructor  and  flight  examiner  personnel  (initial  cadre)  are  formed  to begin  aircrew  training.    Initial  cadre  may  not  be  designated  in  a  crew  position  higher  than currently held; for example, AC-130W IP to AC-130J flight examiner. 1.9.2.  Units will send proposed initial cadre list containing name, rank, current qualification level, aircraft, requested qualification level, total primary aircraft flight hours, total instructor, and evaluator hours (if applicable) to MAJCOM/A3 for approval.  For additional detail, see AFI 11-202, Vol 2.  (T-2) 1.9.3.  Initial  cadre  is  not  required  for  minor  aircraft  modifications  when  any  required training for that modification is provided by the contractor and/or can easily be accomplished in-unit. Conduct differences training for the new equipment and log training on a letter of Xs or Memo for Record (MFR).  Crewmembers may not fly with new equipment until trained. 1.10.  Unit  Aircrew  Capability.  Squadrons  will  maintain  mission  ready  status  on  all  primary aircrew members up to unit authorizations (N/A for USAFWS instructor aircrew members).  (T-3)  Commanders will train aircrews to meet capabilities specified in unit DOC statements.  (T-3)  Supervisory  aircrew  and  staff  members  assigned  above  squadron  level,  which  are  in  excess  of the  unit’s  mission  requirements,  will  maintain  mission  ready,  basic  mission  capable  or  basic   18  AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015 aircraft  qualification  status,  as  required  .    Note:    To  change  from  BMC  to  MR  status,  a crewmember  begins  maintaining  full  MR  flying  currency.    The  unit  commander  may  assign additional training, as desired. 1.10.1.  ACC  Currency  Requirements.    Permanent  Party  aircrew  assigned  to  the  14  WPS  maintain  at  least  basic  mission  capable  flying  currency  in  the  portions  of  the  mission  they  instruct.    Unit  commanders  may  direct  specific  individuals  to  maintain  only  partial  BMC qualifications.  In such cases, the crewmember requires only those currency items associated with this tailored qualification.  The individual’s AF Form 8  indicates applicable restrictions based  on  assignments  of  less  than  full  mission  qualification.    If  14  WPS  crewmembers augment operational units, the gaining unit commander must be provided a detailed list of the individual’s  current  training  status.    The  individual  must  comply  with  MR  training requirements of the gaining unit or pursue applicable waivers through the operational unit’s MAJCOM/A3.    (T-2)    The  gaining  unit  or  MAJCOM  may  levy  additional  requirements  as desired.    Chapter  4  outlines  exceptions  to  continuation  currency  training  requirements  for these  personnel.    Note:    For  the  purposes  of  this  instruction,  enlisted  aircrew  members assigned to the 14 WPS are not considered USAFWS instructors.  (T-3) 1.11.  RAP  Tasking  Memorandum training requirements  for  subordinate  units.    Due  to  dynamic  requirements  of  Combatant  Commanders, training  requirements  and currencies may  be altered regularly.  These training requirement  and currency adjustments may be made via RTM.  AFSOC/A3 is an info addressee on all changes. (RTM).  MAJCOM/A3  will  determine 1.12.  Deviations.  This  instruction does not  authorize deviations from  the flight  manual  or any other  Air  Force  Instruction.    Flight  safety  is  given  prime  consideration  and    takes  precedence over the requirements and guidance of this instruction. 1.13.  Publication  Administration.  This  instruction  is  distributed  to  AFSOC,  AFSOC-gained units,  and  AFSOC  related  schools  based  on  requirements  established  through  the  Air  Force Publications Distribution Office (AFPDO).

Overview.  This  chapter  outlines for  Basic  Aircraft Qualification  (BAQ)  training  which  may  be  completed  as  part  of  initial  qualification, requalification, conversion, or differences training.  Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification training should be kept to a minimum. the  minimum requirements 2.1.1.  Qualification training provides the training necessary to initially qualify crewmembers in  a  basic  crew  position  and  flying  duties.    Upon  completion  of  qualification  training,  the crewmember attains BAQ status.  BAQ is a prerequisite for Mission Qualification Training (MQT, outlined in Chapter 3, this instruction). 2.2.  General  Requirements.  The  primary  method  of  initial  qualification  and  requalification training  is  the  appropriate  formal  training  course  listed  in  ETCA.    If  no  requalification  course exists, conduct requalification using the initial qualification course.  Completing the appropriate formal  course  satisfies  the  training  requirements  of  this  chapter.    When  attendance  is  not practical  or  quotas  are  not  available,  units  may  request  secondary  method  in-unit  qualification training  waivers  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  AFSOC  SUP.    Any  aircrew  member  who  has previously failed to successfully complete the ETCA formal course for substandard performance may not be issued a secondary method training waiver. 2.3.  Training  Prerequisites.  Course  prerequisites  are  IAW  the  appropriate  formal  course syllabus,  the  ETCA,  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  and  this  instruction.    The  formal  school  Syllabus  of Instruction (SOI) designates the course prerequisite approval authority. 2.4.  Ground  Training  Requirements.  All  crewmembers  must  complete  ground  training requirements  IAW  Table  2.1,  prior  to  the  first  flight    (T-3).    See  current  RTM  for  event descriptions. Table 2.1.

See MDS specific RTM for updated event information. 2.4.1.  Written  Examination.    Open  and  closed  book  qualification  examinations  are completed before the completion of basic qualification flying training.  Written examinations  satisfy the requirements of AFI 11-202, Vol 2 and MDS Volume 2.  The formal school will not  forward  their  examinations  as  part  of  the  courseware  for  in-unit  qualifications.    (T-2)  When qualification training is completed by secondary method, the student will complete the appropriate group stan/eval or equivalent examination IAW AFI 11-202V2. 2.4.2.  Emergency  Egress  Training,  Non-Ejection  [LL03].    All  crewmembers  and  other personnel regularly flying on AFSOC aircraft  receive hands-on egress training in the aircraft prior  to  their  first  flight.    Aircrew  members  are  given  flight  deck  and  cargo  compartment familiarization.    Place  emphasis  on  the  location  and  function  of  all  switches  and  controls required  for  all  emergency  procedures.    See  current  AC-130W  Ready  Aircrew  Program Tasking Memo (RTM) for further details.  (T-1) 2.5.  Flying  Training  Requirements.  Satisfactorily  completing  the  appropriate  ETCA  formal course  satisfies  the  requirements  of  this  section.    Approved  in-unit  qualification  training  is accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below: 2.5.1.  Flying  training  lessons  should  be  completed  sequentially.    If  required  by  mission scheduling  or  student  progress,  in-unit  training  sequences  may  be  changed  by  the  unit Operations Officer. 2.5.2.  AFSOC  policy  for  C-130  pilot  training  requires  that,  prior  to  certification,  ACs  and IPs will train to a 3C level in simulated 3-engine takeoffs and simulated 2-engine approaches and  landings.    (T-3)    CPs  will  see  a  demonstration  of  a  simulated  3-engine  takeoff  and  a demonstration  of  a  simulated  2-engine  approach  and  landing  prior  to  flying  without  an instructor.  These events may be accomplished in a simulator to satisfy this requirement.  (T-1) 2.6.  Basic  Aircraft  Qualification  Conversion/Differences/Transition  Training.  Conversion training  is  normally  associated  with  a  unit  conversion  to  another  MDS  (e.g.  C-21  to  C-130).  Difference training is conducted when training in a different series aircraft in the same mission design (e.g. C-130E to C-130H3).  Use difference training when changing between same design aircraft  and  the  amount  of  training  needed  for  qualification  does  not  warrant  attendance  at  a formal  qualification  course.    Additionally,  accomplish  difference  training  when  an  aircraft  is modified  and  any  required  training  for  that  modification  can  easily  be  accomplished  in-unit.  BAQ  difference  training  qualifies  an  aircrew  member  to  be  a  basic  crewmember.    A  formal school transition course (TX) may be used to complete differences training if available.  If a TX course  is  not  available,  the  alternate  method  is  via  in  unit  ground  and  flight  training  IAW MAJCOM/A3T approved AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training Record, satisfactory completion of  the  qualification  written  open/closed  examinations,  and  instructor  certification  on  the AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certification, or AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, for the new aircraft.  Aircrew members entered into differences training will complete training  within 180 days after the first flight  of the training program.    (T-3)   BAQ Differences training is authorized per Table 2.2, this instruction. AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015   21  2.6.1.  For  basic  aircraft  instrument/qualification  purposes,  the  AC-130H,  AC-130U,  C-130E/H,  C-130H1/2,  C-130H3,  EC-130E/H,  HC-130P/N,  MC-130E,  MC-130H,  MC-130P, and  AC-130W  are  generally  considered  to  be  different  series  aircraft  in  the  same  MDS.  Training between the C-130J variants and any other C-130 variant is conversion training and is accomplished via a formal course at an FTU or via SMT. 2.6.2.  For  purposes  of  Paragraph  2.6,  and  Table  2.2,  of  this  instruction,  C-130  ‘slick’ variants  are  C-130E/H,  C-130H1/2,  C-130H3,  and  demodified  EC-130E/H;  difference training and AF Form 4348 or AF Form 1381 entries are required for each variant. 2.6.3.  Upon  completion  of  differences  training  and  certification  on  the  AF  Form  4348  or AF Form  1381,  the  crewmember  is  Basic  Aircraft  Qualified  (BAQ)  in  the  new  aircraft.  Aircrew members may maintain previous C-130 instructor/evaluator and air to air refueling (AAR)  qualifications/certifications  at  the  discretion  of  the  unit  commander.    Other  crew position  qualifications  (i.e.  mission  instructor)  are  attained  through  the  procedures  in Chapter 5, this instruction. 2.6.4.  Aircrew  members  training  to  an  MDS  not  specifically  listed  in  Paragraph  2.6,  or Table 2.2,  this  instruction,  must  complete  transition  training.    (T-3)    Transition  training requires the completion of the formal school initial qualification course. 2.6.5.  Multiple Qualification.  Crewmembers will attend a formal initial qualification or TX course  to  gain  basic  aircraft  qualification  in  another  MDS  unless  authorized  difference training  per  Paragraph  2.6.    (T-3)    For  approved  secondary  method  training,  request courseware IAW Paragraph 1.4. 2.7.  C-130H  Qualification  Training.  All  aircrew  members  in  flying  billets  will  maintain qualification  in  the  AC-130W.    (T-3)    Aircrew  members  may  not  be  solely  qualified  in  the  C-130H.  Students awaiting AC-130W qualification training at the FTU are authorized to fly the C-130H  providing  they  are  qualified  and  current  (if  non-current,  under  the  supervision  of  an instructor).  All C-130H qualified aircrew members will comply with applicable ground training requirements  in  the  RTM  ground  training  table  and  flying  training  requirements  in  the  RTM BAQ table.

Overview.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  training  requirements  for  completing mission qualification and requalification.  Aircrew members completing mission qualification or requalification  are  to  meet  the  requirements  of  this  chapter.    Upon  completion  of  mission qualification  training,  the  crewmember  is  assigned  either  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)  or Mission Ready (MR) status. 3.2.  General  Requirements.  The  primary  method  of  mission  qualification  is  to  complete  the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA.  Completing the appropriate formal course satisfies the training requirements of this chapter.  Requalification training  is accomplished IAW AFI  11-202,  Vol  1.    If  required  and  no  formal  requalification  course  exists,  conduct requalification using the initial mission qualification course.  When attendance is not practical or quotas  are  not  available,  units  may  request  waivers  to  conduct  secondary  method  mission qualification  training  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  AFSOCSUP,  using  formal  school  courseware.  Aircrew  members  who  have  previously  failed  to  complete  an  ETCA  formal  course  for substandard performance are not issued a SMT waiver for same training.  The secondary method requires  use  of  formal  school  courseware  and  a  waiver  from  the  appropriate  waiver  authority.  This  courseware  establishes  the  minimum  training  requirements  to  meet  standards  specified  in AFI  11-2AC-130W,  Vol  2  (or  equivalent).    Units  may  supplement  courseware  to  meet  local requirements.   Submit  all  courseware  change  requests  to  HQ  AFSOC/A3T  prior  to implementation. 3.2.1.  Direct  Support  Operator  (DSO)/Tactical  Systems  Operator  (TSO)  Training.    DSOs and  TSOs  will  complete  appropriate  qualification/requalification  course  utilizing  AFSOC approved  syllabi  and  FTU  provided  courseware.    (T-2)    After  completing  initial  mission qualification training and evaluation, AFSOC differences/conversion training may be used to attain  qualification  in  different  series  of  AFSOC  aircraft.  In  all  instances  use  AFSOC/A3T approved courseware. 3.2.2.  DSOs and TSOs are tasked to  fly on all AFSOC aircraft and will maintain universal qualification per AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, AFSOC Supplement.  They are to comply with AFI 11- 2MDS, Vol 1, DSO and TSO semi-annual ground and flying training currency requirements for each aircraft in which a qualification is held. DSOs and TSOs will log a minimum of one CMP each semi-annual period per aircraft regardless of FTL.  (T-3)  The FTL requirements are halved for each MDS for DSOs who maintain both a C-130 and vertical-lift qualification. 3.3.  Training  Prerequisites.  Course  prerequisites  are  IAW  the  appropriate  formal  course syllabus,  the  ETCA,  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  and  this  instruction.    The  formal  school  syllabus designates the course prerequisite approval authority. 3.3.1.  This  does  not  preclude  simultaneous  basic  qualification  and  mission  qualification training.   Simultaneous/Concurrent  Multiple-MDS  qualification  upgrades  are  not accomplished.   24  AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015 3.3.2.  If there is not a separate mission requalification course, aircrew members requalifying in  the  units  mission  will  comply  with  the  initial  mission  qualification  course  prerequisites.  (T-3) 3.3.3.  For the minimum requirements to be trained as a mission Aircraft Commander, refer to Table 5.1, this instruction.  If the requirements of the table are not met, train and evaluate the individual as a mission CP unless excepted below. 3.3.3.1.  Prior Qualified  Pilots  (PQP, e.g.  FAIP,  OSA, etc.). PQP  pilots   fly in-unit as  a MC  until  they  have  the  required  PAA  flight  time.    Units  will  follow  requalification procedures in Chapter 4, this instruction, to requal those pilots as MPs.  (T-3) 3.3.3.2.  Mobility  Pilot  Development  (MPD)  pilots.    MPD  pilots    complete  AFSOC mission qualification in the right seat.  (T-2) 3.4.  Ground  Training  Requirements.  Complete  all  ground  training  in  Table  3.1,  this instruction, as part of mission qualification training or prior to certifying individuals as mission ready.    Completion  of  training    establishes  due  dates  for  recurring  ground  training  required  in Chapter  4,  this  instruction.    Credit  any  training  accomplished  at  a  formal  school.    Qualified mission ready crewmembers transferred from other units require only unit specific mission ready training events or events which are due/overdue. 3.4.1.  Academic  Training.    Complete  all  academic  and  ground  training  delineated  in applicable  courseware.    If  not  included  in  the  course  syllabus,  accomplish  the  minimum requirements listed in AFI 11-202, Vol 1 separately. 3.4.2.  Written Examination.  Crewmembers must complete a written examination before the end  of  mission  qualification  flying  training.    (T-3)    Formal  school  End  of  Course examinations, Group stan/eval or equivalent examinations for SMT satisfy this requirement.  The formal school  will not forward their examinations as part of the courseware for in-unit qualifications.  (T-2) 3.4.3.

If formal school instructors are deployed for contingency or exercise augmentation, these events are completed prior to deployment. 2.  Training Status Item.  Crewmembers will fly with an instructor until this event is accomplished.  (T-3) 3.  Grounding Item.  Crewmembers must complete training prior to first flight.  (T-3) 3.5.  Flying  Training  Requirements.  Satisfactorily  completing  the  appropriate  ETCA  formal course  satisfies  the  requirements  of  this  section.    Approved  in-unit  qualification  training  is accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below: 3.5.1.  Flying  training  lessons  should  be  completed  sequentially.    If  mission  scheduling  or student  progress  dictates  otherwise,  in-unit  training  sequences  may  be  changed  by  the  unit operations officer. 3.5.2.  There  should  be  minimum  time  lapse  between  training  missions,  and  every  effort should be made to complete mission qualification training requirements within the prescribed time period. 3.5.3.  Crewmember  requirements  may  be  completed  on  training  or  operational  missions under the supervision of an instructor in the same aircrew position.  Comply with restrictions in AFI 11-2AC-130W, Vol 3. 3.6.  Specific  Mission  Training  Requirements.  Dual  qualified  Navigator/CSO  upgrade requirements are provided in Paragraph 5.7, this instruction. 3.7.  Mission Difference Training Requirements.  When mission ready (MR) or basic mission capable  (BMC)  crewmembers  complete  differences  qualification  training  to  a  unit  assigned aircraft to be used in their current mission or to a C-130 having the same mission (i.e., AC-130H to AC-130W), they may be considered MR or BMC in the new aircraft.  If the new aircraft has a different  mission  or  aircraft  differences  warrant,  additional  mission  qualification  training  is required.    The  primary  method  for  accomplishing  this  training  is  to  attend  the  formal  school transition  course  (TX).    If  a  formal  school  course  does  not  exist  and  as  authorized  below, crewmembers  may  accomplish  this  training  in-unit  by  completing  MAJCOM/A3T  approved AF Form 4111, mission open/closed book examinations, and a flight evaluation. 3.7.1.  Crewmembers  qualified  and  current  in  special  mission  events  may  maintain  that qualification, once they are mission qualified in their new aircraft. 3.7.2.  Crewmembers  will  complete  all  required  ground  training  prior  to  being  declared mission ready.  (T-3)   26  AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015 3.7.3.  The  only  crew  positions  authorized  for  in-unit  difference  training  for  mission qualification are aerial gunners, flight engineers.  Accomplish in-unit difference training for aircrew members by completing the AF Form 4111 for difference training and satisfactorily completing  the  unit  written  mission  qualification  examination  for  the  appropriate  crew position. 3.7.3.1.  Aerial  Gunner  Difference  Training.    In-unit  difference  training  is  authorized from all series of AC-130 aircraft using applicable approved courseware. 3.7.3.2.  Flight  Engineer  Difference  Training.    In-unit  difference  training  is  authorized when changing from AC-130W to C-130H and from all series of AC-130 aircraft using applicable approved courseware. AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015   27  Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General Requirements. 4.1.1.  Requirements in this chapter satisfy the minimum flying and related ground training to maintain currency.  Individual proficiency may require a greater number of events.  Failure to accomplish  these continuation training requirements  may not  affect  BMC or MR status  but may  entail  additional  training  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC.    If  any  sortie  or  event  in  this chapter is  included in  the RTM, it becomes a  requirement for  BAQ, BMC, and MR status.  The RTM contains all ground training and flying requirements tables and definitions. 4.1.2.  Training  requirements  may  be  completed  on  any  sortie  if  the  accrediting  criteria  of this instruction are met.  Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the same flight. 4.1.3.  Aircrew  members  will  not  log  continuation  training  requirements  in  events  in  which they are unqualified.  (T-3) 4.1.4.  Training  events  accomplished  on  a  flight  evaluation  or  during  a  sortie  in  which  the aircrew  member  attains  an  instructor  certification  may  be  credited  toward  the  individual’s volume requirements. 4.1.5.  Flying training events accomplished during formal training  use the course completion date  (successful  evaluation  date)  to  establish  the  due  dates  for  all  subsequent  currency  and requirements.   Use actual  dates for  ground training.  Certification events  trained to  a 3C  in the FTU  use the date of the flight evaluation as the initial accomplishment date. 4.1.6.  Aircraft flying training requirements may be accomplished in an ATD as noted in the RTM BAQ and MR flying requirements tables. 4.2.  Training  Levels  (TL).  The  use  of  experienced  based  FTLs  and  Ground  Training  Levels (GTLs) allows the squadron commander to prioritize training resources.  Aircrew members  meet the  minimum  criteria  established  in  Paragraph  4.2.1,  and  Table  4.1,  this  instruction,  before assignment to the respective training level.  When these minimums are met, awarding a training level  is  at  the  sole  discretion  of  the  squadron  commander.    Note:    The  aircrew  member’s availability to fly should not be a factor in assigning a TL.  (T-2) 4.2.1.  FTLs are based on minimum primary aircraft assigned (PAA) time and total time per Table  4.1,  this  instruction.    For  basic  qualification  FTL,  PAA  time  includes  flight  and Weapon System Trainer (WST) time in any variant of C-130.  For mission qualification FTL, PAA time  includes any type C-130 time and any AC-130 WST time. 4.2.1.1.  FTL “A”-Highly experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members. 4.2.1.2.  FTL “B”-Experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members. 4.2.1.3.  FTL “C”-Inexperienced BAQ and MR aircrew members (All Copilots).   28  AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015 Table 4.1.  Minimum FTL Hour Requirements  (T-2).

Crewmembers  may  be  assigned  different  FTLs  for  basic  and  mission  qualifications and individual events.  For example, an aircraft commander coming from EC-130s might be assigned basic FTL “A”, mission FTL “C” with a caveat of FTL “A” for AAR. 4.2.3.  Change of FTL. Once a semiannual period begins, personnel may not be moved to a level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period. 4.2.4.  GTLs are based upon operational flying experience. 4.2.4.1.  GTL “1”–Aircrew members with 5 years or greater of operational flying. 4.2.4.2.  GTL “2”–Aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying. 4.3.  Proration  of  Training  Requirements.  See  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  AFSOC  SUP.    Prorate aircrew  member  flying  training  requirements  for  individuals  following  completion  of  basic qualification,  mission  qualification,  requalification,  and  upgrades  to  a  new  special  mission qualification,  or  who  are  not  available  for  flying  duties  due  to  PCS,  non-flying  TDY,  DNIF, emergency leave, or other unavoidable circumstances which prevent the individual from flying.  Only prorate to zero requirements (No Requirements) for the period of 166 days to 6 months in cases of qualification, requalification, or upgrade.  Aircrew members who enter training after the start  of  the  training  period  may  be  prorated.    Prorate  individual  requirements  based  on  the number  of  full  calendar  months  left  in  the  training  period.    Use  Table  4.2,  and  Table  4.3,  to determine the number of sorties and events required for an individual after proration. Table 4.2.  Prorating Training Requirements.

Recurrency  and  Requalification  Training.  Required when  an aircrew member does not meet  a  currency  requirement  in  this  instruction.    An  aircrew  member  may  not  perform  events unsupervised until training has been accomplished. 4.4.1.  Loss of Currency.  Failure to accomplish events listed in RTM training tables results in  a  loss  of  currency  for  that  event.    Crewmembers  are  non-current  the  day  after  event currency expires. 4.4.1.1.  Loss  of  currency  in  any  RTM  BAQ  table  event  results  in  loss  of  basic  aircraft currency.  These individuals  fly under the supervision of an instructor or flight examiner on all sorties until recurrent.   Exceptions:  FPs that lose left seat landing currency may fly in the right seat without an instructor. 4.4.1.1.1.  Crewmembers who maintain qualification in their primary aircraft and a C-130  variant  may  satisfy  RTM  BAQ  table  currency  requirements  in  either  their primary  aircraft  or  the  C-130.    If  basic  semiannual  currency  is  lost  (failure  to complete the requirements of RTM BAQ table), it is lost for both aircraft.  Lost basic semiannual  currency  may  be  regained  in  either  aircraft.    Crewmembers  must complete  at  least  one  aircrew  proficiency  sortie  in  the  C-130  semiannually.  (T-3)  Failure to complete at least one aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130 results in lost currency in the C-130 only and currency is regained in the C-130. 4.4.1.2.  Loss of currency exceeding 6-months.  Crewmembers non-current in designated BAQ events (RTM BAQ table, note 1 events) in excess of six months results in loss of BAQ.  Crewmembers non-current in designated mission events (RTM MR table, note 1 events) in excess of six months results in loss of mission qualification. 4.4.2.  Regaining Currency. 4.4.2.1.  Only  RTM  BAQ  and  MR  tables,  note  1  events  require  an  evaluation (unqualified) if loss of currency exceeds 6 months (see AFI 11-202, Vol 1).  Other events require  showing  proficiency  to  an  instructor  in  the  aircraft  or  simulator  to  regain currency.  If loss of currency exceeds 24 months in non-note 1 events, additional training consists of ground and flight training as directed by the unit commander (training folder is  opened).    A  FE  may  regain  currency  for  NVG  landings  under  the  supervision  of  an NVG landing qualified IP as long as that IP is not performing any other instructor duties at the time.  (T-2)   30  AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015 4.4.2.2.  Aircrew  non-current  in  special  mission  events  which  only  require  an  instructor certification (Table 5.3) may regain currency by showing proficiency in that event to an instructor. 4.4.3.  Requalification  Training.    Crewmembers  requiring  requalification  will  accomplish training IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1, applicable MAJCOM supplements, and Chapters 2, 3, and 5, of this instruction. 4.5.  Ground  Training.  Ground training is accomplished IAW the RTM ground training table.  Crew  members  will  comply  with  the  time  periods  listed  for  their  FTL/GTL.    (T-2)    Conduct training IAW the referenced publications, notes in RTM ground training table and the guidance below.    The  governing  directive  or  RTM  takes  precedence  over  Chapter  4,  this  instruction, requirements.  If the AFI 11-2AC-130W, Vol 1, is also listed as a governing directive, the most restrictive guidance should be followed. 4.5.1.  Failure  to  Complete  Ground  Training  Events.   Make-up  training  should  be accomplished  at  the  earliest  opportunity.    The  following  apply  when  crewmembers  exceed due dates for events in the RTM ground training table. 4.5.1.1.  Grounding  items.    Crewmembers  will  not  perform  flight  duties  until  the grounding item is satisfied.  (T-3) 4.5.1.2.  Training status items.  Crewmembers will not fly without instructor supervision.  (T-3) 4.5.1.3.  Mission  Ready  (MR)  items.    Failure  to  accomplish  MR  events  in  the  RTM ground  training  table  results  in  non-mission  ready  status  and  the  individual    may  not deploy as a crewmember. 4.5.2.  Ancillary  training.    This  volume  is  not  a  comprehensive  list  of  all  ancillary  training required by the DOD.    Ancillary training parent instructions take precedence over this AFI for those training items. 4.5.3.  Ground  Training  Events.    See  current  AC-130W  Ready  Aircrew  Program  Tasking Memo (RTM) for Ground Training Event definitions and requirements. 4.6.  Flying Training. 4.6.1.  All  aircrew  members  who  maintain  BAQ,  MR,  or  BMC  must  accomplish  all applicable  training  requirements  of  RTM  BAQ  table,  based  on  assigned  FTL  (A,  B,  or  C). (T-3) MR and BMC aircrew will: 4.6.1.1.  Accomplish  applicable  mission  ready  requirements  from  RTM  MR  table according to their mission qualification and FTL.  (T-3) 4.6.1.2.  Accomplish  at  least  50  percent  of  the  applicable  mission  requirements  from RTM MR table according to their assigned FTL.  (T-3) 4.6.1.3.  Maintain left seat aircraft currency IAW RTM BAQ table and right seat mission currency IAW RTM MR table.  (T-3) 4.6.1.4.  Complete Basic Qualification events (RTM BAQ table) in either seat.  Emphasis should be on left seat flying.  Local Proficiency Sorties are flown in the left seat.  PQPs may  fly  in  the  left  seat  for  airland  missions  when  an  aircraft  commander  who  has  a AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015   31  minimum of 100 hours since certification occupies the right seat.  Mission events may be completed  while  performing  copilot  duties  in  the  right  seat  or  in  the  left  seat  when  an aircraft  commander  with  100  hours  since  certification  occupies  the  right  seat.    AFI  11-2AC-130W, Vol 3 (or equivalent), further defines takeoff and landing policy.  (T-3) 4.6.1.5.  MPD pilots may maintain left seat qualification at the discretion of the squadron commander. 4.6.1.6.  Instructors  and  flight  examiners  may  not  log  events  performed  by  other crewmembers during instruction or evaluations. 4.6.2.  Flying  Training  Events.  See  current  AC-130W  Ready  Aircrew  Program  Tasking Memo (RTM) for Flying Training Event definitions and requirements. 4.7.  Multiple Qualifications.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 1, AFSOC SUP. 4.8.  Chemical Defense Task Qualification Training (CDTQT).  The purpose of CDTQT is to reinforce the crewmember's awareness of limitations and demonstrate physiological effects while wearing the aircrew chemical defense ensemble (ACDE).  The complications of heat exhaustion, fatigue, hyperventilation, limited dexterity, and hampered communication can all be experienced during  CDTQT.    All  aircrew  members  must  complete  initial  aircrew  life  support  chemical defense  training  prior  to  accomplishing  initial  CDTQT.    (T-3)    Complete  initial  disaster preparedness training for the ground ensemble prior to CDTQT if the ground ensemble is used.  Initial  CDTQT  should  be  done  in  the  aircraft  and  also  done  in  the  aircraft  at  least  every  four years.    If  initial  CDTQT  is  done  in  the  simulator,  the  next  event  is  logged  in  the  aircraft.    All other  times  the  event  may  be  accomplished  in  the  simulator.    Accomplishing  the  event  in  the aircraft dual logs normal CDTQT. 4.8.1.  CDTQT Procedures. 4.8.1.1.  Accomplish  CDTQT  in-flight  using  the  primary  unit  aircraft.    Crewmembers will perform primary crew duties while wearing the ACDE.  (T-3)  All in-flight profiles are  a  minimum  of  1  hour  and  accomplished  on  training  missions  only.    Accomplish CDTQT in the simulator using primary unit aircraft WSTs.  All simulator profiles are a minimum of 2 hours and flown on full tactical simulation profiles.  This should include a threat scenario and aircraft emergencies.  Flying the simulator profile with the entire crew wearing ACDE is highly encouraged. 4.8.1.2.  The  entire  ACDE  need  not  be  used.    Normally,  wear  the  filter  pack,  cotton gloves, butyl rubber gloves, Nomex gloves, and the protective hood, along with the CBO mask/AERPS and helmet (if applicable).  Either the ACDE or ground ensemble may be worn during aircraft preflight.  Ground ensembles come from training assets. 4.8.1.3.  When  wearing  the  CBO  mask,  do  not  accomplish  CDTQT  when  required  to wear NVGs.  When wearing AERPS, NVG events are accomplished. 4.8.1.4.  An  observer  is  required  to  monitor  each  crewmember  while  accomplishing CDTQT in-flight.  An instructor or flight examiner in each respective crew position, not wearing  the  chemical  defense  components,  will  act  as  the  observer  for  initial  CDTQT.  (T-3)    Exception:  An  IP  not  wearing  the  ensemble  and  not  performing  any  other instructor  duties  may  act  as  the  observer  for  initial  FE  training.    During  recurring CDTQT, if the crewmember can be directly observed by another primary crewmember, a   32  AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015 dedicated observer is not required.  The dedicated observer during recurring CDTQT may also  wear  AERPS  for  all  crew  positions  except  pilots  (two  non-pilot  crewmembers wearing  AERPS  may  observe  one  another).    Additionally,  for  safety  purposes,  one crewmember in the back of the aircraft cannot wear AERPS in case of smoke and fumes. 4.8.1.4.1.  An  instructor  or  flight  examiner  pilot  not  wearing  the  chemical  defense components will occupy the opposite seat during initial pilot CDTQT.  (T-3)  During recurring  CDTQT,  a  mission  qualified  pilot  not  wearing  the  chemical  defense components  will  act  as  the  observer  and  occupy  the  opposite  seat.    (T-3)    With squadron  commander  approval,  both  pilots  may  wear  AERPS  while  occupying  the pilot seats provided both pilots have accomplished CDTQT within the past 90 days.  The  squadron  commander  may  delegate  this  authority  to  the  operations  officer  or mission commander.  (T-2) 4.8.1.4.2.  Observers    closely  monitor  crewmembers  actions  during  CDTQT.    If  a crewmember  experiences  difficulties  such  as  excessive  thermal  stress,  headaches, hyperventilation, nausea, etc., the crewmember will remove the ensemble.  (T-3)  The observer will notify the AC of any difficulties encountered.  (T-3) 4.8.2.  Mission  profile.    Crewmembers  will  accomplish  CDTQT  during  a  normal  mission profile that includes mission crew duties (CAS, live fire, dry fire, air refueling, etc.).  (T-3)  In addition: 4.8.2.1.  Pilots  will  accomplish  a  minimum  of  one  approach  and  landing.    (T-3)    Pilots may accomplish CDTQT in either seat. AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015   33  Chapter 5 UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING 5.1.  General.

Inventory  (BAI)—Aircraft  assigned  to  a  unit  to  assist  in  maintaining readiness.  Aircraft designated as BAI assets do not receive funding or manning consideration for the unit. Basic  Aircraft  Qualification  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily completed  qualification  training  in  the  basic  aircrew  position  and  maintains  aircraft  currency IAW this instruction. Basic  Mission  Capable  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily completed  mission  qualification,  and  is  maintaining  50  percent  of  the  applicable  mission qualification  currency  requirements  of  this  instruction.    Basic  mission  capable  crewmembers may perform primary crew duties on any unilateral training mission.  For other missions, the unit commander    determines  the  readiness  of  each  basic  mission  capable  crewmember  to  perform primary crew duties. Calendar Month—Requirements are due once per month and not necessarily associated with a 30/60  day  requirement.    For  example,  an  aircrew  member  could  accomplish  the  event  on  1 February and then on 31 March the following month and still fulfill the requirement. Conversion Training—Training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.  Conversion training requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course.  For unit conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle the throughput, MAJCOMs will develop, and coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre. Core  Mission  Events—A crewmember is qualified in all core mission events to be considered Mission  Ready  (MR)  or  Mission  Capable  (MC).    To  determine  how  non-currency  in  any  core mission  event  affects  overall  mission  currency,  refer  to  the  aircraft’s  Mission  Ready  Flying Requirements Table (RTM MR table).  Loss of qualification in any core mission event results in loss of overall mission qualification.  A core mission event is considered an instructor certified event when it is not required to be evaluated on the Initial Mission Evaluation.  Squadrons will maintain at least 100 percent of their required manning as MR.  (T-3)  AFSOC unit CC/DO will determine  the  status/qualification  of  crewmembers  in  excess  of  100  percent  manning requirement.  (T-3) Difference Training—Training accomplished when changing between same design aircraft and the  amount  of  training  needed  for  qualification  does  not  warrant  attendance  at  a  formal qualification course. Direct Support Operator (DSO)—An AFSOC aircrew position responsible for providing threat warning  and  enhanced  situational  awareness  to  SOF  missions  utilizing  intelligence  data  and expertise in the area of operations. Dual  Qualified—A crewmember  who is  qualified in  more than one  crew position in  the same MDS. AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015   47  Event—A  training  item  to  be  accomplished.  Multiple  events  may  be  completed  and  logged during a sortie unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this instruction. Formal  School  Courseware—Training materials and programs  developed for training  aircrew members  at  formal  schools.    It  includes  all  student  study  guides,  workbooks,  computer-based training lessons, instructor guides, and AF Form 4111, Individual Mission Grade Record, related to the specific course. Formation  Operations—Accomplish  IAW  applicable  volume(s)  of  AFSOCI  11-202, AFI 112AC-130W,  Vol  3  (or  equivalent),  and  TO  1-1C-1-20.    AFSOC  guidance  is  never  less restrictive  than  the  formation  definitions  found  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  “Formation  Flight”, “Nonstandard Formation”, and “Standard Formation”.  Formation operations place all aircraft in a  critical  phase  of  flight  which  requires  constant  vigilance,  strict  discipline,  and  polished  crew coordination  for  mission  accomplishment.    Training  ensures  aircrew  can  think  and  plan  for multiple aircraft instead of single ship operations. Instructor  Certified  Events—Training given to  an aircrew member that requires an instructor to certify the student's attainment of the required proficiency and knowledge levels as specified in courseware and, if appropriate, AF Form 4111.  Instructor certified events are documented in AF Form 4348. Mission  Design  and  Series  (MDS)  for  Aircraft—The  official  designation  for  aerospace vehicles used to represent a specific category of aerospace vehicles for operations, support, and documentation purposes. Mission  Essential  Task  List  (METL)—Combat-oriented  training  requirements.    All  AFSOC aircrew training requirements should be in support of unit METLs. Mission  Events—The squadron Doctrinal (DOC) Statement defines required crew capabilities.  These capabilities/tactics/events can be categorized as either Core or Special Mission. Mission  Oriented  Simulator  Training—Training  conducted  in  a  WST  or  MRD  that incorporates a full mission profile.  The focus of this training should be crew coordination and problem solving. Mission  Ready  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily  completed mission  qualification  and  is  maintaining  all  of  the  applicable  mission  qualification  currency requirements of this instruction. Multiple Qualification—A crewmember who is qualified in more than one MDS. Self-Contained  Approach  (SCA)—An  approach  conducted  using  self-contained  navigation systems on the aircraft. Special  Mission  Events—Some  MR/MC  crewmembers    carry  additional  qualifications  in special  mission  events.    Unit  CC/DO  determines  which  crewmembers  to  qualify  in  special mission events. Unit CC/DO will determine if special mission events have affected C- rating and report  variations  through  Status  of  Resources  and  Training  Systems  (SORTS).    (T-3)    Special mission requirements are also shown in the RTM MR table. Syllabus  Deviation—A  syllabus  deviation  is  any  unplanned  variation  from  syllabus  or equivalent  directed  requirement  such  as  prerequisite  flow,  turn  times,  landing  currency, minimum number of events, etc.   48  AFI11-2AC-130WV1  8 JULY 2015 Syllabus  Waivers—A  planned  one-time  exception  to  the  syllabus  used  to  enhance  or accommodate student training in special or unusual circumstances. Tactical  Systems  Operator  (TSO)—An  AFSOC  aircrew  position  responsible  support  to  SOF missions utilizing intelligence data and expertise. Total Flying Time—Total time for all aircraft flown in military service to include student time.  Time accumulated is in the aircrew member's current rating (i.e., pilot, navigator, etc.). Training  Device—A  hardware  device  that  permits  learning,  development,  and  the  practice  of skills  and  procedures  necessary  for  understanding  and  operating  the  integrated  systems  of  a specific prime mission system. Training Status—A deficient status in which a crewmember must fly under the supervision of an instructor when occupying a primary crew position.  Once deficient items are corrected, the crewmember is removed from training status. Volume—For the purposes of this instruction, volume refers to the number of events an aircrew member must accomplish in a given period of time (i.e., quarterly or semiannually).
