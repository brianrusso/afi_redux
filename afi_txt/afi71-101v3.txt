Technical  Surveillance  Countermeasures  (TSCM).  TSCM  includes  techniques  and measures  to  detect,  neutralize,  and/or  exploit  a  wide  variety  of  hostile  and  foreign  penetration technologies  used  to  obtain  unauthorized  access  to  classified  and  sensitive  information. Department  of Defense  Instruction (DoDI) 5240.05,  designates the Air Force Office of Special Investigations  (AFOSI)  as  the  only  Air  Force  organization  authorized  to  perform  TSCM activities. 1.1.1.  Intelligence  Community  Directive  (ICD)  702,  establishes  Director  of  National Intelligence  (DNI)  policy  and  assigns  responsibilities  for  the  oversight  of  the  Intelligence Community (IC) TSCM programs. 1.1.2.  The National Technical Surveillance Countermeasures Strategy of the United States of America sets mission and enterprise objectives for the IC TSCM programs. 1.1.3.  The  Technical  Surveillance  Countermeasures  Implementation  Plan  carries  out  the national mission and enterprise objectives. 1.1.4.  Legal  authority  to  conduct  TSCM  is  outlined  in  DoD  5240.1-R,  Procedures Governing the Activities of DoD Intelligence Components That Affect United States Persons. 1.1.5.  DoDI  5240.05  defines  the  role  of  TSCM  as  one  of  the  counterintelligence  (CI) functional  services  and  applies  to  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  military departments, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff, the Combatant  Commands,  the  Office  of  the  Inspector  General  of  the  Department  of  Defense, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities, and all other organizational entities within the DoD. 1.1.6.  DoD  S-5240.05-M-1  &  2,  The  Conduct  of  Technical  Surveillance  Countermeasures, establishes  the  guidelines  and  procedures  for  the  conduct  of  TSCM  activities  in  the  DoD. Military Service Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) are detailed agreements between the Department of the Army G2X (AG2X), US Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), US Marine Corps Director of Intelligence and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) on the provision of cross-service TSCM support to each other as well as providing TSCM support during conflicts, contingencies, or security and stability operations. 1.2.  Philosophy of TSCM Activities. 1.2.1.  Technical surveillance may be the last information collection method of choice to U.S. adversaries. It may be used because other intelligence collection attempts (Cyber, HUMINT, SIGINT,  etc.)  have  failed  to  produce  results,  there  is  no  other  way  to  obtain  the  desired information,  or  as  a  demonstration  of  their  national  will.  AF  organizations  must  employ comprehensive  mitigation  efforts  including  counterintelligence,  security,  and  information assurance 0). procedures, technical counter to security threats. (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015   5  1.2.2.  Adversaries  include  Foreign  Intelligence  and  Security  Services  (FISS),  organized crime, drug traffickers, terrorists, persons engaged in industrial espionage, dissident groups, and others with interest in U.S. information. 1.2.3.  Our  adversaries  seek  information  to  support  bargaining  positions  (diplomatic),  asset information  (intelligence),  personal  data  (counterintelligence),  battle  plans  (National Defense), economic data (diplomatic/criminal), or law enforcement data (criminal). 1.2.4.  Technical surveillance usually takes the form of devices or software installed for the specific purpose of audio, visual, or data collection of information from a sensitive area. This information  may  be  obtained  by  direct  technical  penetration,  or  by  exploiting  a  technical vulnerability or physical security weakness. Devices employed may range from simple wired microphones  to  sophisticated  software  or  remote  controlled  devices  and  may  use  existing infrastructures such as networks, telephone, power lines, etc., to facilitate the surveillance. 1.3.  Scope of TSCM Activities. 1.3.1.  AFOSI  will  identify  and  focus  TSCM  efforts  on  likely  targets  of  FISS  or  other adversaries  intent  on  collecting  sensitive  or  classified  U.S.  information  through  technical means. (T-0). 1.3.2.  TSCM  activities  can  be  performed  anywhere  classified  or  sensitive  information  is discussed or processed.  This  includes government  and commercial  facilities, aircraft, boats, vehicles,  and  hotel  rooms,  as  appropriate.  TSCM  activities  use  techniques  and  specialized equipment to deter, detect, neutralize, and/or exploit technical penetration technologies used to  obtain  unauthorized  access  to  classified  and  sensitive  information.  TSCM  also  includes customer education to help defend against technical surveillance exploitation. 1.3.3.  TSCM activities are used to detect and/or prevent technical penetrations. Penetrations are  the  intentional,  unauthorized  interception  of  information-bearing  energy  such  as establishment of a clandestine transmission path to provide egress of a technical surveillance product. 1.3.4.  AFOSI will coordinate with  the Director of Counterintelligence (DCI) in  accordance with  ICD  304,  Human  Intelligence,  and  Director  of  Central  Intelligence  Directive  (DCID) 5/1P,  Espionage  and  Counterintelligence  Activities  Abroad,  TSCM    activities    conducted Outside  the  Continental  United  States  (OCONUS)  off  of  DoD  installations. (T-0). 1.4.  Limitations of TSCM Activity. 1.4.1.  TSCM activities are not a substitute for proper security practices. Physical, personnel and  industrial  security  practices  are  the  most  effective  impediments  to  a  technical penetration.  The following security practices affect the long-term validity of a TSCM: 1.4.1.1.  Maintaining a continuous and verifiable access control program. 1.4.1.2.  Controlling  the  acquisition,  shipment,  storage,  and  maintenance  of  equipment and furnishings. 1.4.1.3.  Implementing  a  strict  oversight  and  security  program  during  construction  and renovation. 1.4.1.4.  Using  cleared  and  qualified  personnel  with  controlled  equipment  to  design, install, and maintain intrusion detection and access control systems.   6  AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015 1.4.1.5.  Using  cleared  and  qualified  personnel  for  the  design  and  maintenance  of information systems. 1.4.2.  TSCM  is  not  compliance-oriented  and  should  not  be  confused  with  such  activities. However,  failure  by  customers  to  address  any  security  issues  identified  during  a  TSCM should be considered an acceptance of risk. 1.4.2.1.  When  a  TSCM  is  completed  the  requestor  is  given  reasonable  assurance  the surveyed  area  is  free  of  active  technical  surveillance  devices.  The  requestor  is  also informed  of  the  overall  security  posture  of  the  facility  to  include  all  security vulnerabilities  discovered  within  the  area  and  given  a  suggested  course  of  action  to correct them. However, the requestor should know it is impossible to provide an absolute guarantee there are no devices in a surveyed area. 1.4.2.2.  The  TSCM  survey  does  not  in  itself  eliminate  existing  security  vulnerabilities nor  ensure  the  technical  security  status  of  the  area  cannot  subsequently  change. Uncontrolled  access  by  unauthorized  or  uncleared  persons;  the  introduction  of  new furnishings, equipment, or construction; or alterations within the area could result in the placement  of  a  clandestine  device  and  nullify  any  existing  technical  security vulnerabilities.  Standards  of  physical,  personnel  and  industrial  security  need  to  be  kept high if any assurance given by the survey is to be maintained. 1.4.2.3.  TSCMs  are  usually  a  one-time  evaluation  and  only  accomplished  after  a validated threat  assessment  has indicated the  facility may be a likely target  of technical surveillance. Any assurance of protection remains in effect unless physical (construction in  facility),  personnel,  or  industrial  security  (uncontrolled  access  to  the  facility  by unauthorized persons) has been breached. Additional surveys may be requested if there is reason to believe a technical penetration of the facility may have occurred or the threat to the facility or operation has increased. 1.5.  The  USAF  TSCM  Program.  The  USAF  TSCM  program  is  authorized  by  the  Under Secretary  of  Defense  for  Intelligence  (USD(I))  IAW  DoDI  5240.05  and  centrally  managed  by HQ AFOSI. 1.5.1.  Support  will  be  based  upon  customer-initiated  requests  for  TSCM  or  proactively initiated by AFOSI based upon intelligence threat information in order to protect sensitive or classified AF information. In either case, AFOSI will comply with DoD 5240.1-R, Procedure 5, Part 4. (T-0). 1.5.2.  All  AF  personnel  attending  TSCM  training  specified  in  DoDI  5240.05  must  first  be approved by the USAF TSCM Program manager. (T-0). 1.6.  Air  Force  Office  of  Special  Investigations  (AFOSI).  The  AFOSI  is  a  field  operating agency directly responsible to the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) for criminal investigative authority  and  is  delegated  the  independent  authority  within  the  Air  Force  to  initiate  criminal investigations.  The  USAF  TSCM  Program  is  executed  by  the  Commander,  IAW  Air  Force Mission Directive 39, Air Force Office of Special Investigations. 1.6.1.  The AFOSI Commander’s designated Program  Manager for TSCM is  located at  HQ AFOSI, 27130 Telegraph Road, Quantico, VA, 22134. AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015   7  1.6.2.  AFOSI is the only Air Force organization authorized to conduct TSCM investigations, acquire and possess TSCM equipment, or have TSCM personnel assigned. 1.6.3.  TSCM  Certification.    TSCM  personnel  must  meet  the  following  TSCM  certification requirements: 1.6.3.1.  All initial and recurring training required in DoDI 5240.05. (T-0) 1.6.3.2.

Overview.  When  suspected  technical  surveillance  activities  are  discovered,  all  personnel will  employ  security  measures  in  a  manner  preventing  anyone  at  the  “listening  end”  of  the technical surveillance operation from learning the surveillance activity has been discovered. (T-0) 3.2.  Actions upon Discovery. 3.2.1.  Do not handle the device. Any person who discovers an actual or suspected technical surveillance  device  or  possible  technical  surveillance  activity  must  report  it  immediately  to the  person  responsible  for  security  of  the  area.  (T-1)  Discussion  concerning  the  discovery shall not occur in the area where the suspect device or activity is located and shall preferably occur  outside  the  facility.  AFOSI  must  treat  all  suspected  technical  surveillance  devices  or activities  as  possible  intelligence  gathering  activities  of  a  foreign  intelligence  service  until proven otherwise. (T-1). AFOSI  will classify the discovery in accordance with  AFI 71-101 vol  4,  Counterintelligence  and  DoDI-C  5240.08,  Counterintelligence  (CI)  Security Classification Guide (see Chapter 7 of this instruction for additional classification guidance). (T-0).  Specific  information  necessary  to  facilitate  the  investigation  may  be  released  to  law enforcement  agencies  IAW  DoD  5240.1-R  and  with  the  concurrence  of  the  USAF  TSCM Program Manager. If a device or suspected technical surveillance activity is discovered, the security manager or person who finds it will: 3.2.1.1.  Leave  the  suspect  device  in  place  and  ensure  the  area  is  secured.  No  tests  or attempts at removal shall be conducted unless directed by AFOSI after coordination with the USAF TSCM Program Manager. (T-1) 3.2.1.2.  Prevent  any  person  not  specifically  authorized  by  AFOSI  from  tampering  with or removing the device. (T-1) 3.2.1.3.  Ensure no one discusses the suspect device in the area where it is located. (T-1) 3.2.1.4.  Continue normal work in the area to the greatest extent possible. (T-2) 3.2.1.5.  Brief  only  those  people  who  are  directly  involved  with  the  facility  and  must immediately know about the suspect device.(T-2) 3.2.1.6.  Thoroughly document all aspects of the discovery noting location, dates, times, and all personnel involved or having knowledge of the discovery. (T-2) 3.2.2.  As  part  of  the  official  investigation  of  the  suspect  device,  AFOSI  agents  may  brief other  individuals  on  a  need-to-know  basis,  to  include  senior  officials  in  the  chain  of command. 3.2.3.  The  person  responsible  for  security  of  the  area  must  immediately  notify  his/her supporting AFOSI unit or the AFOSI Operations Center. (T-2) If needed, contact the AFOSI Watch  Center  at  (571-305-8484)  from  outside  the  affected  area  via  secure  phone.  The following information is needed in the initial report (T-0): AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015   11  3.2.3.1.  Name  and  contact  information  of  the  person  reporting  the  suspected  technical surveillance device. 3.2.3.2.  Time and date of discovery. 3.2.3.3.  Area, personnel, installation or facility involved. 3.2.3.4.  Method of discovery. 3.2.3.5.  Why you believe it may be a technical surveillance device. 3.2.3.6.  An  assessment/opinion  as  to  whether  or  not  personnel  involved  with  the discovery  alerted  the  “listener”  or  intended  recipient  of  the  information  that  their operation has been compromised. 3.3.  Air Force TSCM Program Manager’s Role:  If a suspected surveillance device is found, the    USAF    TSCM    Program    Manager    must    notify    the    DoD    TSCM    Program  Manager located in DIA within 1 duty day. (T-0) 3.3.1.  The USAF TSCM Program Manager needs to monitor AFOSI’s investigation. 3.3.2.  AFOSI  investigators  will  make  appropriate  reporting  through  the  USAF  TSCM Program Manager to national-level agencies as appropriate. (T-2). 3.4.  AFOSI’s Investigative  Role  upon  Discovery  of  a  Technical  Surveillance Device.  AFOSI  will  conduct  a  detailed  investigation  following  the  discovery  or  alleged discovery  of  any  technical  surveillance  device  or  activity  targeting  AF  facilities,  information, personnel  or supported defense organizations. (T-0)  Information derived from the investigation can be used to  assist the intelligence community, evaluate damage to national security, provide current threat information to Air Force and supported commanders, and to assist in strengthening Air Force security and countermeasures programs.   12  AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015 Chapter 4 TSCM SUPPORT DURING CONFLICTS, CONTINGENCIES, OR SECURITY AND STABILITY OPERATIONS 4.1.  Overview.  This  chapter  identifies  roles/responsibilities  and  establishes  standard  request and  reporting  procedures  for  TSCM  support  during  conflicts,  contingencies,  or  security  and stability  operations.  TSCM  is  a  CI  Functional  Service  authorized  in  accordance  with  DoDI 5240.16, DoD Counterintelligence Functional Services. It is one of five separate, but interrelated functions  within  DoD  CI  (investigations,  operations,  collection,  analysis  and  production,  and functional  and  technical  services  including  but  not  limited  to  TSCM  computer  network operations,  and  polygraph)  (ref.  Joint  Pub  2-01.2,  Counterintelligence  and  Human  Intelligence Support to Joint Operations, for additional details). 4.2.  Organization.  In  order  to  retain  organizational  integrity,  a  combined  or  joint  force commander  (JFC)  normally  exercises  coordination  authority  of  designated  CI  TSCM  support elements  through  their  respective  Service  component.  Each  CI  organization’s  TSCM  support element  remains  under  the  direction  and  control  of  their  respective  military  Services  and/or agency,  unless  otherwise  directed  by  the  President  or  SecDef.  However,  if  directed  by  the President or SecDef, the JFC will exercise OPCON of military forces and capabilities (including TSCM)  assigned  and  attached  to  the  joint  force  (i.e.  Joint  CI  units).  (T-0).  The  JFC  will  not exercise OPCON over law enforcement or CI investigations. (T-0). 4.3.  Roles and Responsibilities. 4.3.1.  Combined/Joint  Force  Commander  (JFC).  The  JFC  is  a  combatant  commander (CCDR), subunified commander, or joint task force commander. The CCDR is authorized to exercise  combatant  command  (COCOM)  over  a  joint  force.    A  subunified  commander,  or joint  task  force  (JTF)  commander  may  be  authorized  to  exercise  operational  control (OPCON) or tactical control (TACON) over assigned forces. 4.3.2.  Joint Force Staff Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Element (J2X). As the command focal point for CI, the J2X is responsible to coordinate, synchronize, manage, and deconflict all DoD CI activities in the JFC’s operational area. 4.3.3.  Task  Force  Counterintelligence  Coordination  Authority  (TFCICA).  When designated,  the  TFCICA  is  a  CI  officer  who  exercises  coordinating  authority  over  joint  CI mission requirements in a designated joint operations area. Should this coordinating authority not prove sufficient to accommodate the JFC CI goals, the TFCICA then refers the matter to the JFC with sufficient command authority to resolve the situation.  Typically this JFC is the CCDR  who  exercises  COCOM  over  assigned  CI  activities  and  units  in  the  joint  operations area  (JOA).    The  TFCICA  also  coordinates  and  deconflicts  the  activities  of  the  Service component CI organizations in the JOA. The JFC may also delegate tasking authority to the TFCICA. The TFCICA will engage with the senior representative of each Service CI element in the operational area as the composition of the staff is determined to  ensure the Services’ contribution reflects their proportionate share of CI resources in the operational area. This is normally  in  the  CI  component’s  best  interest,  since  their  own  personnel  are  most knowledgeable  about  their  capabilities  and  limitations,  and  can  ensure  appropriate apportionment of their component during the contingency. AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015   13  4.3.4.  Operations Support Element (OSE). The OSE (if established by the J2X) consists of three  separate  branches  and  is  responsible  for  all  administrative,  operations  support,  and services  support  functions  within  the  J2X.  TSCM  is  aligned  under  the  Technical  Support Branch along with Polygraph, Biometrics, Linguists and Technical Operations. 4.3.5.  Command  Counterintelligence  Coordinating  Authority  (CCICA). The CCICA is the  combatant  commander’s  expert  on  CI  matters.  The  CCICA  exercises  staff  supervision over subordinate joint CI staff elements on behalf of the combatant commander to maintain complete  situational  awareness  of  all  CI  activities  throughout  the  combatant  command assigned to the operational area. 4.3.6.  Military  Departments  or  Service  CI  Organizations. Service CI organizations (e.g. Air  Force  Office  of  Special  Investigations)  are  responsible  for  the  conduct,  direction, management,  coordination, and control of CI  activities within their respective organization, as well as providing CI support to other organizations as required. 4.3.7.  DoD  TSCM  Program  Manager  (PM).  The  PM  at  DIA  coordinates  TSCM responsibilities  when  Military  Service  CI  organization  are  unavailable  or  when  it’s  unclear which Military Service CI organization has primary TSCM responsibility. 4.4.  Request and Reporting Procedures. 4.4.1.  All AF units assigned to the joint operations area will request TSCM through the J2X or  their  designee.  (T-0).  The  J2X  ensures  requests  are  IAW  DoD  5240.1-R,  DCID  5/1  (if applicable),  and  DoDI  5240.05.  AFOSI  commanders  will  conduct  TSCM  activities  IAW DoD  S-5240.05  M1  &2.  (T-0).  This  responsibility  may  be  delegated  to  the  TFCICA  (if assigned) or operations support element (OSE) (if assigned). 4.4.2.  Unless  otherwise  designated  by  the  J2X,  AF  units  in  the  JOA  should  use  AF  Form 4445,  Request  for  Technical  Surveillance  Countermeasures  (TSCM),  or  the  TSCM  request format in DoD S-5240.05-M-1 (Appendix 1) to request TSCM. 4.4.3.  All  TSCM  requests  from  units  in  the  JOA  should  be  submitted  to  the  J2X,  or TFCICA’s  office  if  designated  by  the  J2X.  Any  request  misrouted  to  a  service  CI organization  should  be  forwarded  to  the  J2X  for  action  (ref.  Attachment  2,  JOA  TSCM Request Flowchart). 4.4.4.  The J2X, validates/approves the request IAW DoD policy and coordinates support as follows: 4.4.4.1.  If  the  combatant  commander  determined  during  the  planning  process  the formation of a joint CI unit(s) to focus on both strategic and operations-level CI missions would make CI support (all or designated functions) more responsive to command needs, then  the  commander  may  have  addressed  the  formation  of  a  joint  CI  unit(s)  and  have dedicated  TSCM  personnel  assigned.  The  CI  unit  will  define  the  full  scope  of responsibility  and  authority  in  the  unit’s  concept  of  operations  (CONOPS).  (T-0).  If TSCM  capabilities  are  resident  in  the  command’s  joint  CI  unit(s),  the  TFCICA  shall coordinate  the  TSCM  activity  with  this  supporting  joint  CI  unit  (IAW  the  unit’s CONOPS) once the request has been validated by the J2X. 4.4.4.2.  If  no  joint  CI  unit  with  TSCM  capability  has  been  formed,  or  if  additional TSCM resources are required to support the JFC within an operational area, the TFCICA   14  AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015 should  coordinate  through  the  combatant  command  CCICA  and  sister  elements  within the J2X for Military Service CI component TSCM support. The Service CI components will  provide  CI  TSCM  support  to  their  Service  component  commanders,  combatant commanders,  designated  task  forces,  the  CJCS,  and  other  DoD  agencies  and  defense support  activities  in  accordance  with  DoDI  5240.05,  Enclosure  3;  using  the  TSCM capabilities through their own organizations or other military support agencies.  (T-0) 4.4.4.3.  In addition to the Military Service CI components, additional DoD organizations with  TSCM  resources  exist  and  may  be  available  to  provide  limited  support.  TSCM support from  these organizations should be coordinated through the DoD TSCM PM at DIA. 4.4.5.  The  joint  CI  unit  or  Service  CI  organization  conducting  the  TSCM  shall  be responsible  for  reporting  TSCM  activities  IAW  established  DoDI  5240.05,  Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) Program. (T-0). 4.4.6.  The  AFOSI  team  lead  for  OCONUS  TSCMs  not  conducted  on  a  US-controlled compound must coordinate activities IAW DCID 5/1P as appropriate. (T-0). 4.4.7.  Reference Military Service TSCM organization MOUs as applicable. AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015   15  Chapter 5 TSCM INVESTIGATIONS 5.1.  Overview.  Reference Chapter 4 of this instruction for requesting support during conflicts, contingencies,  or  security  and  stability  operations.  TSCM  investigations  are  highly  specialized counterintelligence  investigations  and  as  such,  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  compromise. Therefore,  all  reasonable  measures  should  be  taken  to  ensure  the  request  for  the  TSCM investigation  and  subsequent  activity  are  not  compromised.  Until  the  investigation  indicates otherwise,  assume  the  facility  is  under  technical  surveillance.  Therefore,  any  discussion  of  the TSCM investigation in the area could compromise it and result in the surveillance device being temporarily deactivated or removed. Requests for TSCM investigations via non-secure means are considered compromised and cannot be approved. 5.1.1.  AFOSI  may  conduct  pre-construction  surveys  as  a  service  to  AF  Commanders  who are  designing  secure  areas  for  the  protection  of  sensitive  and/or  classified  information. Organizations planning major new classified projects or programs should consider the need for TSCM investigations early in the process. 5.1.2.  TSCM personnel are authorized access to the content of any communications acquired during the TSCM activity IAW DoD 5240.1-R. 5.1.3.  Conferences or sessions requiring discussions of sensitive or classified information are to be held in cleared government or contractor facilities whose security is commensurate with the sensitivity of the information discussed. AFOSI will not conduct TSCM activities in areas not  cleared  to  the  appropriate  security  level  unless  waivered  by  the  USD(I)  in  accordance with Assistant Secretary of Defense Memorandum, Classified Information and Meetings and Conferences, October 26, 2001 and DoDI 5240.05 para 6.2.3. (T-0) 5.1.4.  As a baseline, all AFOSI TSCM personnel have a Top Secret security clearance with Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  access.  Requestors  are  responsible  for  providing  the appropriate access authorization necessary for unescorted access of TSCM personnel. TSCM personnel cannot appear out of place and should be indistinguishable from other permanent facility personnel. 5.2.  Discussing  the  TSCM  Request  and  Investigation.  Never  discuss  the  TSCM    request and/or  investigation  within  the  area  to  be  surveyed  or  with  foreign  nationals.  Should  a surveillance device exist, such a discussion would most likely lead to any device being removed prior to the investigation and later reinstalled or simply switched off remotely by the person in control  of  the  device.  Under  such  circumstances  the  probability  of  discovering  the  device  is greatly  diminished.  For  this  reason,  no  discussion  or  verbal  comments  concerning  the  pending support should be permitted in the areas to be investigated. 5.3.  TSCM  Support  During  Exercise  and  Deployments.  TSCM  investigations  can  be requested  to  support  exercises  involving  sensitive  or  classified  information;  however,  they  are never  part  of  an  exercise.  The  only  exceptions  are  training  operations  conducted  by  the intelligence  community  or  AFOSI  for  the  specific  purpose  of  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of TSCM  equipment,  procedures,  or  personnel.  The  Air  Force  TSCM  Program  Manager  will approve participation in these exercises.  (T-2).   16  AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015 5.4.  Authorized  Requestors.  Air Force or DoD entities responsible for areas where classified or sensitive information is processed or discussed are authorized to submit requests for a TSCM investigation.  Non-Air  Force  agencies  requesting  support  from  AFOSI  will  abide  by  this instruction as a condition for AFOSI approval. (T-2) Failure to follow AFOSI’s guidance during an on-going TSCM investigation may result in its termination. 5.5.  Request Process.  Request TSCM in accordance with procedures established by AFOSI. 5.5.1.  Submit  requests  to  local  or  servicing  AFOSI  unit  using  AF  Form  4445,  Request  for Technical  Surveillance  Countermeasures  (TSCM).  If  unable  to  determine  the  servicing AFOSI unit, contact the AFOSI Global Watch Center’s Hotline at (571) 305-8484 via secure means from outside of the area of concern. 5.5.2.  The Air Force Program Security Manager must coordinate TSCM requests for Special Access programs. 5.5.3.  Submit requests through secure communications. Secure voice requests should not be made from within the facility for which the TSCM is being requested. 5.5.4.  TSCM may involve the incidental acquisition of the nonpublic communication of U.S. persons  without  their  consent.  The  official  in  charge  of  the  facility,  organization,  or installation  must  consent  to  the  use  of  TSCM  IAW  where  the  countermeasures  are  to  be undertaken  (ref.  DoD  5240.1-R,).  (T-0).  Within  the  AF  this  is  usually  the  commander  (or equivalent), not the unit security officer or staff members. 5.6.  Approval  Criteria  for  TSCM.  Not  all  facilities  processing  sensitive  and/or  classified material  can  receive  TSCM  support.  AFOSI  will  use  a  risk-based  approached  to  planning  and executing the Air Force TSCM program. (T-1). 5.6.1.  AFOSI retains final approval authority for the conduct of TSCM activities. 5.6.1.1.  AFOSI  must  coordinate  OCONUS  TSCMs  not  conducted  on  a  US-controlled compound with the DCI IAW DCID 5/1P. (T-0). 5.6.2.  New  facilities  and  those  having  undergone  major  renovations  cannot  receive  TSCM support  until  all  construction  and  interior  decoration/finishing  has  been  completed,  all equipment and furnishing are in place and the facility is fully operational and working on a normal day-to-day functional status. This may be waived under certain circumstances by the USAF  TSCM  Program  Manager  when  the  threat  is  deemed  to  be  extremely  high  or  the information to be protected extremely sensitive (i.e. related to loss of life). 5.6.3.  TSCM  investigations  of  general  officers’  or  other  senior  officials’  quarters,  offices, and conveyances, because of their position and potential targeting, may be provided despite minimal security provisions. 5.6.4.  Normally,  once  a  facility  receives  a  TSCM  investigation  it  cannot  receive  recurring TSCM  investigations.  In  principle,  once  an  area  has  been  the  subject  of  a  TSCM investigation  with  a  favorable  outcome,  the  results  are  considered  valid  as  long  as  the security  integrity  of  the  facility  is  maintained.  AFOSI  will  recommend  in  its  final  report  if additional or recurring TSCM support should be considered by the commanding official. (T-1). 5.6.5.  Follow-on TSCM support may be approved if: AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015   17  5.6.5.1.  There is evidence to suggest an area has been technically penetrated. 5.6.5.2.  There  was  extensive  construction,  renovation  or  structural  modifications  that required unescorted access by uncleared individuals. 5.6.5.3.  Unauthorized  personnel  gained  uncontrolled  or  unescorted  access  to  the  secure area.  If  this  access  was  a  result  of  poor  security  practices,  this  needs  to  be  corrected before follow-on TSCM activities are considered. 5.6.6.  Certain  high  profile  areas,  due  to  extensive  FISS  targeting,  may  be  designated  for recurring TSCM support by the Air Force TSCM Program Manager. 5.7.  Scheduling.  TSCM investigations are not inspections. No preparations are necessary other than  those  outlined  in  this  instruction.  Scheduling  should  be  done  in  conjunction  with  the requestor.  However,  a specific date  cannot  be set.  The requestor is  given a 90-day window for the TSCM investigation. Once scheduled, knowledge of a pending TSCM investigation is  kept on a need-to-know basis. If TSCM investigations are announced in advance, they may lose their effectiveness. 5.7.1.  TSCM  investigations  cannot  be  scheduled  when  the  facility  is  empty  or  not performing  its  primary  function.  For  example,  investigations  of  senior  officer  suites  should not be accomplished if the officer is away. Surveillance devices in the area would likely be turned off or disabled making its discovery problematic. 5.8.  Technical  Security  Measures.  The  following  security  measures  should  be  taken  for  all areas being considered for TSCM. While not all inclusive, they represent actions that should be taken to help ensure the area is not vulnerable to technical surveillance. The following measure should be considered prior to requesting TSCM: 5.8.1.  Ensure  the  telephone  security  of  areas  to  be  investigated  is  IAW  AFI  33-220, Communication—On-Hook  Telephone  Security  and  Telephone  Security  Group  (TSG)  and National (ref.  http://www.cnss.gov/). Telecommunications publications Security  Group (NTSWG) 5.8.2.  Ensure  adequate  acoustical  protection  exists  to  prevent  unauthorized  persons  from overhearing discussion in the area. 5.8.3.  Ensure  necessary  physical  security  safeguards  are  in  place  to  prevent  unauthorized access to the area. 5.8.4.  Remove all electronic storage or recording equipment not certified as essential to the mission. 5.8.5.  Provide properly trained escorts for those persons who need occasional access to the facility but who do not meet the criteria for unescorted access. 5.8.6.  Do  not  allow  repairs  or  alteration  of  sensitive  areas  except  under  the  supervision  of qualified and responsible personnel who can control the workers. 5.8.7.  Minimize the introduction of new furnishings or equipment that have not been under US control or procured through secure means. 5.8.8.  Do  not  allow  personal  electronic  devices  in  sensitive  or  classified  discussion  or processing areas.   18  AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015 5.8.9.  Do  not  allow  portable  electronic  devices  (e.g.,  cell  phones)  in  sensitive  or  classified discussion or processing areas. 5.9.  Unit  Responsibilities  Before,  During  and  After  a  TSCM.  The  organization’s Commander  requesting  TSCM  must  take  steps  to  ensure  the  TSCM  team  is  not  compromised when  preparing  for  or  conducting  the  TSCM  investigation.  (T-2).    Accordingly,  the  requestor will ensure the following: 5.9.1.  Ensure  the  team  members  have  unescorted  access  to  the  entire  facility  during  the TSCM investigation. (T-1) 5.9.1.1.  This  includes  all  information  systems,  including  telephones,  classified  and unclassified  networks,  teleconference  systems,  etc.  (ref.  DoD  S-5240.05-M-2).  Ensure system administrators are identified and available to TSCM personnel as needed. (T-1) 5.9.2.  Ensure  the  team  is  able  to  transport  their  equipment  into  the  facility  without  undue attention and the equipment is properly secured. 5.9.2.1.  TSCM  equipment  consists  of  items  not  normally  allowed  within  secured classified  environments  (e.g.,  cameras,  recording  and  transmitting  equipment,  network inspection  equipment,  and  other  types  of  electronic  devices).  This  equipment  is authorized solely for TSCM purposes and is not subject to inspection, validation, or pre-approval by unit personnel. 5.9.3.  Ensure  a  normal  working  atmosphere  is  maintained  in  the  area  before  and  during  a TSCM  investigation.  This  includes  refraining  from  any  comments  in  the  area  which  would reveal a TSCM investigation is contemplated or underway. (T-2). 5.9.4.  For  Sensitive  Compartmentalized  Information  Facilities,  provide  the  automated information  system  accreditation  package  including  local  area  network  (LAN)  maps  to  the TSCM team when requested. 5.9.5.  Provide a copy of the facility blueprints and/or floor plans when requested. (T-2). 5.9.6.  Ensure  continuous  access  controls  have  been  established  as  part  of  an  effective security program to preclude undetected unauthorized access. (T-2). 5.9.7.  Ensure  only  those  people  with  an  absolute  need-to-know  learn  an  investigation  has been requested or actual investigation is underway. (T-2). 5.9.7.1.  Ensure  the  TSCM  investigation  is  not  compromised  by  allowing  uncleared visitors into the area while the investigation is underway. (T-2). 5.9.8.  If, in the opinion of the TSCM team leader, the effectiveness of the TSCM has been compromised,  it  will  be  terminated  and  is  not  rescheduled  until  the  situation  causing  the compromise  has  been  corrected.  (T-1).  The  unit’s  commander  will  ensure  an  appropriate security inquiry is initiated if the compromise involves disclosure of classified information to uncleared personnel. (T-2). 5.10.  TSCM  Investigation  Out-Briefings.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  investigation,  the  TSCM team should provide a briefing on the results of the TSCM to appropriate facility personnel. The purpose  of  the  briefing  should  be  to  make  the  requestor  aware  of  any  security  deficiencies discovered  during  the  investigation.  TSCM  team  leader  will  provide  recommendations  for corrective measures to  enhance information  security.  (T-0). TSCM team  leader will include  all AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015   19  applicable  deficiencies  and  recommendations  in  the  TSCM  written  report  provided  to  the requesting  official  no  later  than  10  duty  days  after  completion.  (T-0).  At  the  discretion  of  the TSCM team, minor deficiencies corrected during the investigation by facility personnel may not be included in the report. 5.11.  What  to  Expect  from  TSCM.  TSCM  team  leader  will  identify  unauthorized  technical surveillance and indicate the technical security status of the inspected area during the period of the investigation. (T-0). The investigation provides the requester with  a professional  evaluation of a facility’s technical security posture. These evaluations are appropriate for virtually any area where classified or sensitive information is discussed or processed on a routine basis. However, it  should  be  noted  TSCM  is  a  manpower  and  resource  intensive  activity  and  can  only  be approved  for  those  facilities  where  there  is  a  viable  threat  against  the  information  discussed  or processed.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  investigation  cannot  replace  traditional  security measures as its focus is primarily counterintelligence not security or administrative compliance. Any assurance given by the team that the area is free of technical surveillance devices should be nullified  if,  after  completion,  the  physical  security  of  the  area  is  not  maintained.  The  TSCM teams: 5.11.1.  Detect  any  technical  surveillance  exploitation  of  an  area,  usually  through  the discovery of a technical surveillance device or modification of installed equipment. 5.11.2.  Identify classified or sensitive information “leaking” from a facility. Note: TSCM is not  a  replacement  for  EMSEC  or  TEMPEST  measures  (for  EMSEC  program  information, ref. AFI 33-200). 5.11.3.  Identify exploitable security conditions supporting or facilitating the installation of a device or modification of existing equipment to conduct technical surveillance. 5.11.4.  IAW  DoD  5240.1-R,  AFOSI  agents  performing  TSCM  activities  are  authorized  to monitor all government communications systems located within or servicing the area. AFOSI agents  are  required  access  and  authorization  to  determine  the  existence  and  capability  of electronic surveillance equipment being used by persons not authorized to conduct electronic surveillance. This  monitoring is  subject  to the limitations of procedure 5 contained in  DoD 5240.1-R. AFOSI agents will monitor these systems (traditional phone systems, voice-over-internet- protocol (VOIP), networks, etc.) by physical, electronic, or other means IAW DoD Manuals S-5240.05-M-1 & 2. (T-0). 5.12.  Requesting  Technical  Security  Threat  Briefings.  Awareness  training  of  the  technical threats  is  an  integral  part  of  the  TSCM  Program.  AFOSI  can  provide  CI  threat  briefings  to educate  AF  personnel  on  best  practices  and  procedures  to  minimize  the  threat  of  foreign collection activities. 5.12.1.  Upon  request,  AFOSI  will  present  appropriately  classified  briefings  on  current technical security threats and TSCM procedures to the following personnel: 5.12.1.1.  Personnel who are responsible for the security of sensitive facilities. (T-2). 5.12.1.2.  Personnel assigned to sensitive facilities receiving TSCM services. (T-2). 5.12.1.3.  Personnel who provide escort for uncleared visitors or workers in areas eligible for TSCM service. (T-2).   20  AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015 5.12.2.1.  Individuals  or  offices  desiring  technical  security  threat  briefings  should  send written requests containing the following information to their servicing AFOSI unit: 5.12.2.2.  The name of the organization or the activity requesting the briefing. 5.12.2.3.  A brief mission synopsis of the organization or activity. 5.12.2.4.  The location for the requested briefing. 5.12.2.5.  The  approximate  number  of  individuals  attending  the  briefing,  their  level  of security clearance, and a brief synopsis of their positions within the organization (such as command staff, security management, etc.). 5.12.2.6.  A preferred briefing date. 5.12.2.7.  All requests should be sent as far in advance of the briefing as possible to allow for the collection of current relevant threat information. AFI71-101V3  13 MAY 2015   21  Chapter 6 TSCM REPORTS 6.1.  Overview.  The  AFOSI  team  leader  will  generate  TSCM  reports  using  the  DoD  standard report  format  and  comply  with  all  requirements  in  DoDI  5240.05.    (T-0).    The  report  needs  to include threat assessments used to prioritize the investigation and any factors used to determine the overall security posture of the area. 6.1.1.  Reports of TSCM investigations conducted within  temporary  facilities in  a deployed environment may be limited in scope and forwarded via message or other secure means. 6.2.  TSCM Report Dissemination.  AFOSI will submit a written TSCM report to the requestor within 10 duty days of the conclusion of the TSCM investigation or after the investigation of a suspected technical penetration. (T-3). 6.2.1.  TSCM  reports  should  reflect  only  those  conditions  with  the  potential  to  allow  the transmittal  of  information  to  unauthorized  persons  through  technical  and  physical penetrations or deficiencies in the facility. Recommendations for correcting the deficiencies are provided but are not directive in nature. 6.2.2.  The  Recipient  commander  will  not  disseminate  the  TSCM  reports  generated  by AFOSI  without  the  permission  of  the  Air  Force  TSCM  Program  Manager.  (T-1). Unclassified  excerpts  may  be  disseminated  to  assist  in  correcting  identified  deficiencies. These  excerpts  cannot  divulge  that  the  deficiency  was  discovered  as  part  of  a  TSCM investigation, a connection to AFOSI, or the significance of the security deficiency. *Exceptions: A copy of the report on any TSCM activity conducted in a DIA certified SCIF should  be  available  to  DIA/DAC-2  (Defense  Intelligence  Agency  /  Chief,  Security  Division). TSCM reports are also archived in Portico and available to CI personnel with the appropriate clearance and access (i.e. analysts and DoD TSCM personnel). 6.3.  Required  Actions  Upon  Receipt  of  the  Report.  TSCM investigations are not conducted for  the  purpose  of  determining  compliance  with  administrative  security  requirements.  The requesting  unit  commander  must  forward  an  after  action  report  to  AFOSI  within  30  calendar days  of  receipt  of  a  report  if  the  TSCM  identified  any  Security  Vulnerabilities  or  Items  of Security  Interest,  IAW  DoDI  5240.05.  (T-0).    The  requestor  will  ensure  an  appropriately classified  after  action  report  is  provided  to  the  AFOSI  point  of  contact  for  the  TSCM investigation.  (T-0)  After  action  reports  are  essential  to  measure  the  effectiveness  and  value  of the DoD TSCM Program. 6.3.1.  The  TSCM  Team  Leader's  report  will  include  all  actions  taken  to  correct  identified items and include the following: 6.3.1.1.

Classification of TSCM Information.  Information pertaining to the TSCM program needs to be protected to preserve the integrity of the information and the program. Use DoD Instruction C-5240.08,  Counterintelligence  Security  Classification  Guide  (U),  and  Executive  Order  (EO) 12958,  Classified  National  Security  Information  (U),  and  this  publication  for  guidance.  If  the TSCM activity is associated with a special access program (SAP), the classification guidance for that program may apply. 7.1.1.  Normally  photographs,  floor  plans,  or  other  diagrams  of  the  facility  will  not  be classified unless they are specifically associated with the TSCM activity. 7.2.  Compromise  of  TSCM  Information.  AFOSI  agents  will  report  any  compromise  of classified  TSCM  information  to  unauthorized  persons  (i.e.  foreign  nationals  or  personnel lacking  the  proper  security  clearance)  immediately  to  the  Air  Force  TSCM  Program Manager.  (T-1).  AFOSI  will  document  the  details  of  the  compromise  and/or  monitor  any subsequent investigation into the compromise. The Air Force TSCM Program Manager will in-turn provide the findings to DIA (DoD TSCM Program Manager) for damage assessment. (T-1). 7.3.  Information  Release.  Requests  for  release  of  any  information,  classified  or  unclassified, pertaining to Air Force TSCM information, methods, or equipment are to be forwarded to the Air Force TSCM Program Manager. 7.3.1.  TSCM  Equipment  Procurement.  Information  relating  to  the  acquisition  or procurement  of  any  equipment  (U.S.  Government  or  Commercial  Off-the-Shelf  (COTS) systems) utilized for TSCM cannot be associated with AFOSI or the AF TSCM program. 7.3.1.1.  Only  TSCM  equipment  vetted  and  approved  by  the  DoD  TSCM-IMG  can  be solicited for procurement. 7.3.1.2.  Once vetted and approved, requirements for equipment used in the USAF TSCM Program  can  be  advertised  as  Brand  Name  only  IAW  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1(c).   Reference 10  U.S.C.2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1 and DFAR 206.302-1 for additional info. 7.3.1.3.  Efforts are to be made to ensure offers are solicited from as many U.S. potential sources as deemed possible.  GREGORY A.
