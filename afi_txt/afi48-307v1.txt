Mission Description.  AE includes all elements of medical care, support, treatment, staging and  transport,  from  the  point  at  which  a  request  for  movement  has  been  received,  through  the final  destination  for  definitive  care.  Aeromedical  Evacuation  (AE)  provides  time-sensitive movement  of  casualties  to  and  between  Medical  Treatment  Facilities  (MTFs),  using  organic and/or contracted aircraft with medical aircrew trained explicitly for this mission. AE forces can operate  as  far  forward  as  aircraft  are  able  to  conduct  air  operations,  across  the  full  range  of military operations, and in all operating environments. Specialty medical teams may be assigned to work with the AE aircrew to support patients requiring more intensive patient care. The goal is to  match  patient  needs with  the  appropriate  skills,  knowledge,  equipment,  and  infrastructure  to enable  safe,  effective,  and  efficient  AE.  The  AE  system  is  a  subset  of  the  overall  patient movement system. Patient movement begins as soon as a patient receives care, which may be at point of injury. Patient staging provides medical personnel and equipment necessary for 24-hour patient  staging  operations,  patient  transportation  to/from  aircraft,  and  administrative  processes for tracking patients transiting the AE system worldwide. 1.2.  Purpose.  This  AFI  provides  clinical  information  and  guidelines  to  promote  safe  and effective  en  route  care  for  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  beneficiaries  and  designees. Information presented in this AFI sets minimal standards for stabilized/stabilizing peacetime and wartime/contingency patient airlift operations, and is not intended to be used as a substitute for sound clinical judgment. 1.3.  Applicability.  This instruction applies to  all Air Force personnel,  AE and ERPS assigned personnel,  associated  in-flight  care  personnel  and  ground-based  Air  Force  AE  personnel, including Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG). 1.4.  Scope. 1.4.1.  Staging  facilities  provide  inpatient  medical-surgical  care.  Critically  ill  or  inpatient mental  health  patients  will  be  cared  for  at  the  nearest/supporting  MTF  with  required capability or on a short-term basis by an En Route Critical Care (ERCC) team (i.e. Critical Care  Air  Transport  Team;  Tactical  Critical  Care  Transport  Team;  Burn  Team;  Neonatal Intensive  Care  Team)  at  the  staging  facility  for  patients  awaiting  airlift.  (T-3)  En  Route Critical Care teams encompass several critical care teams (e.g. burn, neonatal, lung, pediatric, trauma). Provisions must be in place to address support services and additional clinical care required  by  patients  in  the  staging  facility  due  to  patient  condition  changes  or  mission delays/cancellations.  (T-3)  The  primary  supporting  MTF  is  responsible  for  providing  all clinical, surgical and ancillary support required for patients in the staging facility regardless of size. 1.4.2.  The  standard  Aeromedical  Evacuation  Crew  Member  (AECM)  complement  will provide specialized inpatient medical-surgical care capability with Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) resuscitative capability while contacting C2 for further medical direction. (T-2) During mission execution, AECM’s clinical practice is under the  medical  direction  of  the  Theater  Validating  Flight  Surgeon  (TVFS).  Mission requirements  drive  the  use  of  specialty  augmented  medical  teams,  individual  medical 10 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 attendants (MA), and advanced care teams subject to patient need, strategic requirements and aircraft availability/platform type. NOTE: In an emergency, when no physician is present or cannot be contacted, AECMs and/or medical personnel will follow guidance outlined within this  instruction,  and  are  authorized  to  perform  BLS/ACLS  within  their  scope  of  practice  in emergency  situations  to  preserve  life,  limb,  or  eyesight.  (T-2)  The  medical  crew  director (MCD) will notify the appropriate Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC) of any treatment performed outside a patient’s written orders as soon as operationally feasible. (T-2) 1.4.3.  Medical personnel in the AE system provide care based upon their Air Force Specialty Code  (AFSC),  Military  Occupational  Specialty  (MOS),  and  Naval  Enlisted  Classification (NEC) scope of practice/specific core competencies, level of knowledge, training, and skills. 1.5.  Standards. 1.5.1.  Standards of Care (SOC):  The AE and patient staging environments present the health care  provider  with  unique  challenges.  The  stresses  of  flight  must  be  considered  in  patient preparation. The SOC in the air are adapted to the aircrafts’ capabilities and limitations, and the in-flight environment. Refer to AFPD 46-1, Nursing Services. 1.5.2.  Standards  of  Performance:    The  standards  of  professional  performance  are  the expected level of function based on education, level of experience and criteria of the current AFSC/MOS/NEC position requirements. The baseline educational clinical standards of care is  inpatient  medical-surgical  care.    AMC/SGK  has  adopted  Mosby  Online,  Lippincott,  and Air  and  Surface  Transport  Nurses  Association  (ASTNA)  standards  of  professional performance  (when  operationally  feasible).  Refer  to  AFI  46-101,  Nursing  Services  and Operations. 1.5.3.  Standards of Practice:  Standards of practice focus on the medical personnel and their competency,  experience,  and  education.  The  primary  goal  of  the  AE  system  is  to  meet  the perceived, actual, or potential health needs of the patient, while maintaining the continuum of care. Refer to AFPD 46-1. 1.5.4.  Aeromedical Evacuation Clinical Protocols. AE Clinical Protocols are evidence based clinical  protocols  that  provide  standard  orders  in  specific  clinical  scenarios.  AE  Clinical Protocols at: https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/usafae/sg/SG%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx. located are AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 11 Chapter 2 OPERATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Manages launch and recovery of missions, interfaces with flight line support agencies, assists with  configuration of aircraft for AE missions, and overseas flight line  activities  for  patient  loading  and  unloading.  Supports  AE  and  ERCC  teams  equipment and resupply. Coordinates AE crew and ERCC teams requirements for life support, billeting, food  service,  transportation,  finance,  and  administrative  needs  (when  ERCC  teams  are attached to the AES). 20 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 3 REQUESTING AE PATIENT MOVEMENT THROUGH PMRC 3.1.  Requesting  AE  for  Patients.  The  referring  privileged  provider  assesses  risks  associated with  patient  movement  and  determines  the  need  for  evacuation.  The  AE  environment  and  the physiological  stresses  of  flight  described  in  Chapter  7  can  impair  the  ability  to  assess  and deliver  care  while  airborne.  Consultation  between  the  referring  privileged  provider  and  the PMRC  is  essential  to  mitigating  these  risks.  Transport  can  be  executed  by  military  or commercially  procured  modes.  The  request  for  AE  begins  with  the  initiation  of  a  PMR  by  the referring privileged provider. If the patient requires Urgent or Priority movement, call the PMRC immediately in addition to starting a PMR. 3.1.1.  PMRs  and  AF  Form  3899s  are  generated  at  the  referring  MTF  by  entering  patient information into TRAC2ES. The PMR contains fields for administrative and clinical data for validation  and  regulation.  The  AF  Form  3899  has  the  referring  privileged  provider’s signature  and  orders  for  AE  (ground  transport,  staging,  in-flight,  and  remain-overnight phases). The AF Form 3899 is the authorizing document for in-flight care, as well as part of the patient’s permanent medical record. 3.1.2.  Referring  Privileged  Provider.  The  referring  privileged  provider  and  the  Validating Flight  Surgeon  (VFS)  both  have  patient  care  responsibility  roles.  The  referring  privileged provider  initiates  a  medical  referral  and  clinical  assessment,  much  like  they  do  when requesting medical consultation. The VFS reviews this information, makes adjustments and interventions, then oversees the movement of the patient from one location to the next. Both providers have significant clinical input into the patients' care and outcome. 3.1.2.1.  The  referring  privileged  provider  will  be  responsible  for  finding  an  accepting privileged provider at the destination facility, if applicable. (T-2)  The PMRC will verify an accepting privileged provider, once obtained by referring privileged provider. (T-2) 3.1.2.2.  The  referring  privileged  provider  will  stabilize  patients  entering  the  regulated patient movement system as much as the situation and resources allowed include, but are not limited to: securing airway, controlling hemorrhage(s), treating shock and stabilizing fractures. (T-2) 3.1.2.3.  The referring privileged provider is responsible for completing transfer orders on the AF Form 3899 for all routine, urgent and priority patients. (T-2) 3.1.2.3.1.  This  order  will  include  the  phone  number,  service  and  name  of  the accepting provider (i.e., Transfer to Dr. X, General Surgery) as applicable. (T-2) 3.1.2.3.2.  Hand-written  orders  and  patient  information  must  be  written  legibly  so accurate patient information is relayed. (T-2) 3.1.2.3.3.  After  consulting  with  the  governing  PMRC  and  the  TVFS,  the  referring privileged  provider  must  take  into  account  the  adverse  effects  of  stresses  of  flight when writing orders. (T-2) 3.1.2.3.4.  Orders for AE must be signed by the referring privileged provider in order to be carried out. (T-2) AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 21 3.1.2.3.5.  All  special  diets  will  be  ordered  by  the  referring  privileged  provider  and documented on the AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent. (T-2) 3.1.2.4.  The referring privileged provider is responsible for writing or dictating a transfer summary whenever a patient is being transported in the AE system. (T-2) 3.1.2.4.1.  The  referring  privileged  provider  should  provide  key  information, including pending labs, x-rays, consults and the current status of the patient and their anticipated needs. (T-2) 3.1.2.4.2.  The  referring  privileged  provider  will  outline  recurring  assessment requirements.      (T-2) 3.1.2.4.3.  The referring privileged provider in collaboration with the VFS will order any O2 requirements needed during flight. 3.1.2.4.4.  The  referring  privileged  provider  in  collaboration  with  the  VFS  must provide  appropriate  documentation  requesting  use  of  VSB  or  a  NATO  litter  with  a Cervical Collar and have an ERCC team assigned to the patient. (T-2) 3.1.2.4.4.1.  Originating  facilities  are  responsible  for  assisting  ERCC  team  with putting the patient on the VSB. 3.1.2.4.4.2.  Always use a cervical collar (C-collar), in conjunction with the VSB, if  C-Spine  injury  is  suspected.  NOTE:    Equipment  waiver  is  required  from Standards & Evaluations             (AMC/A3VM) for VSB. 3.1.2.5.  Intra-theater triggers to activate burn flight team. Patients with significant burns, as defined by ABA criteria (http://www.ameriburn.org) as described in Attachment 10, will benefit from prompt consultation with a burn surgeon and transport to a burn center. 3.1.2.5.1.  Treating  physician  will  initiate  PM  process  and  contact  USAISR  Burn Center  designated  representative.  (T-2)  Governing  PMRC  will  assist  sending physician  with  appropriate  recommendations  for  PM  process.  (T-2)  Physician-to-physician  communication  is  vital  in  developing  optimal  movement  plan  for  each patient. The USAISR can be contacted at 210-222-2876 or DSN 312-429-2876. 3.1.2.5.2.  Burn patients who meet ABA burn center referral criteria shall be validated for  movement  precedence  in  consultation  with  the  TVFS,  USAISR  and  referring privileged provider. (T-2) If TRAC2ES is not available, direct contact with servicing PMRC  is  recommended  to  facilitate  PM.  (T-2)  The  USAISR  Burn  Center  will provide name of accepting burn surgeon. (T-2) Delay or inability to contact the Burn Center directly should not delay processing of the PMR. 3.1.2.5.3.  Criteria  for  Significant  burns:    Full  thickness  (3rd  degree)  burns  of  any size,  partial  thickness  (2nd  degree)  involving  >10%  Total  Body  Surface  Area (TBSA), or Burns >20% total body surface area. Only partial and full thickness burns are used to calculate % TBSA. 3.1.2.5.4.  Burns involving >10% TBSA in children and adults over 50 years old. 3.1.2.5.5.  Significant burns to the hands, face, feet, ankles, perineum, genitals, across major joints or circumferential burns. 22 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 3.1.2.5.6.  Smoke inhalation injury. 3.1.2.5.7.  Burn patients with associated polytrauma. 3.1.2.5.8.  Burn patients requiring mechanical ventilation. 3.1.2.5.9.  Burn  injury  in  patients  with  preexisting  medical  disorders  which  could complicate management, prolong recovery, or affect mortality. 3.1.2.5.10.  Burn  patients  with  high  voltage  (>1000  V)  electrical  injury,  including lightning.  Fluid  rate  cannot  be  estimated  using  %  TBSA  because  much  of  the  high voltage  injury  is  hidden.  Consultation  with  a  burn  surgeon  at  the  USAISR  is recommended to guide initial resuscitation guidelines. 3.1.2.5.11.  Chemical burns. 3.1.2.5.12.  Burns that require critical care or resuscitation (e.g. needing ERCC team transport). 3.2.  Local  Flight  Surgeon.  The FS is  the local authority for determining whether patients  are physiologically  ready  for  air  transport.  The  FS  or  privileged  provider  in  consultation  with  the TVFS (if a  FS is  not  available) will clear AE patients  for flight.  (T-2) The FS in  collaboration with  the VFS, may also  determine if a patient’s category should change  and adjust AE clinical care as indicated to safely transport patient. 3.2.1.  Patients in remain overnight (RON) status will remain under the care of the local FS, unless transferred to other privileged providers for specialty or higher-level care. (T-2) 3.2.2.  The  FS  must  reevaluate  each  RON  patient  for  continuation  in  the  AE  system, including those that are transferred. (T-2) This clearance to fly (proceed) will be documented on the AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent. (T-2) 3.2.3.  If transferred, the local MTF FS must assess whether the patient’s condition warrants removal from AE until further stabilized for movement. (T-2) 3.2.4.  When no FS is available,  the privileged provider at the RON location responsible for the RON-ing patients is responsible for the above duties (T-2) Approval for the RON with no FS should be confirmed before the patient departs the sending facility. (T-2) 3.3.  Patient Movement Considerations. 3.3.1.  When  requesting  AE,  the  requesting  provider  obtains  an  accepting  provider  at  the receiving  facility.  The  referring  privileged  provider  consults  the  governing  PMRC  to consider  standards  for  aeromedical  movement  of  patients,  flight  safety  and  operational constraints  of  the  current  operational  environment.  Weather,  maintenance  problems, availability  of  aircraft,  crew  duty  day  limitations,  en  route  stops,  and  diversions  may  cause delays, cancellations, or denials to requests for AE patient movement. Secondarily, patients should not experience any degradation in the delivery of a required level of care as a patient moves  through  different  phases  of  patient  movement,  e.g.  ground  to  air  to  ground.  The  FS and referring privileged  provider, in conjunction  with  the PMRC will work to  mitigate  any issues resulting from degradation in the level of care. (T-3) 3.3.2.  All  non-contingency  inpatients  being  moved  must  have  an  accepting  privileged provider and available bed prior to PMR submission. (T-2) If a non-contingency inpatient is AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 23 transiting a Continental United States (CONUS) patient staging facility without the required clinical capability, an interim RON accepting privileged provider at a local hospital must be arranged  by  the  referring  privileged  provider  and  documented  in  the  PMR.  (T-2)  NOTE:  There are situations when contingency patients also require an accepting privileged provider. The PMRC will provide guidance for these situations. (T-2)  3.4.  Submitting a PMR for Validation and Movement. 3.4.1.  Submit  a  PMR  as  soon  as  the  need  for  movement  is  determined.  The  patient movement  process  begins  when  the  referring  MTF  electronically  submits  the  PMR  to  the PMRC through TRAC2ES.  If the MTF does not have access  to  TRAC2ES, call the PMRC for assistance in  obtaining access  and/or submitting the PMR. The PMR contains fields  for clinical data and administrative data. 3.4.2.  The PMR will accurately reflect the patient’s current condition and medical equipment requirements. (T-2) The PMR also provides a succinct care summary to ensure the receiving MTF  is  prepared  and  capable  for  assuming  care  of  the  patient  upon  arrival.  Significant changes in the patient’s condition require updates to the PMR. Submitting thorough clinical and  administrative  information  will  shorten  the  validation  process.  The  PMR  content  will contain  the  following  information  when  applicable  and  should  be  consistent  with documentation contained within the patient’s medical record: 3.4.2.1.  Diagnosis. (T-2) 3.4.2.2.  Reason for movement. (T-2) 3.4.2.3.  Concise  and  accurate  medical  history.  This  includes  any  procedures/treatments specifically  addressed  in  this  document,  related  to  patient  diagnosis  (i.e.,  chest  X-ray results at least 24 hrs. post chest tube removal). (T-2) 3.4.2.4.  Date and time of last relevant surgery. Absolute dates and times are used (i.e. 3 Aug 14); not relative dates/times (i.e., 3 days ago). (T-2) 3.4.2.5.  Privileged provider’s orders. (T-2) 3.4.2.6.  Plan of care. (T-2) 3.4.2.7.  Current Vital Signs (VS) will be documented in the PMR within 72 hours prior to validation for all routine in-patients. All Urgent (U) and Priority (P) patients will have VS documented in the PMR within 12 hours prior to validation. (T-2) 3.4.2.8.  Significant lab values. Will have current hemoglobin and hematocrit  (H&H) for all  trauma,  post-arrests,  and  post-operative  patients.  If  ventilated,  will  include  arterial blood gas results within 12 hours of validation. (T-2) 3.4.2.9.  Oxygen  (O2)  requirements.  (T-2).  NOTE:    A  pulse  oximeter  is  available  on board  AE  aircraft,  but  referring  privileged  providers  must  recognize  these  devices  can give  erroneously  higher  readings  under  certain  physiologic  conditions  (i.e.,  carbon monoxide  poisoning,  dehydration,  anemia,  impaired  peripheral  circulation,  and  high  or low cardiac output states). NOTE:  A cabin altitude restriction is sometimes required in addition to supplemental oxygen therapy. 3.4.2.10.  Documentation  for  regional  and  epidural  pain  management  infusions  will include the medication, dosage, drug concentration, location, rate of infusion, pump type, 24 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 and the service that is overseeing the infusion. The pain score will also be documented in the PMR. Orders for break through pain management must be included. (T-2). 3.4.2.10.1.  Prior to manifesting a patient with epidural analgesia or Peripheral Nerve Block  (PNB)  infusions  onto  an  AE  flight,  the  presence  of  the  epidural  or  PNB (infusing or capped) will be annotated on the PMR within the TRAC2ES system. (T-2) The TVFS must be aware of the presence of the epidural or PNB infusion prior to clearing the patient for flight. (T-2) 3.4.2.10.2.  It  is  essential  for  all  providers  to  know  the  action  and  side  effects  of patient specific medications prior to starting care and prior to departure. 3.4.2.10.3.  During  the  placement  of  the  epidural  catheter  if  “loss  of  resistance technique  with  air”  has  been  used,  or  a  “wet  tap”  occurs,  the  patient  will  wait  a minimum  of  24  hrs.  prior  to  planned  AE  mission  to  decrease  the  possibility  of complications such as pneumoencephalopathy occurring. (T-2) 3.4.2.11.  All current medications with dose, frequency and route. (T-2). 3.4.2.11.1.  Anesthesia  will  order  and/or  review  all  pain  medication  loading  dose(s), PCA bolus dose amount, lock-out interval, basal flow (continuous) rate, breakthrough pain  orders,  continuous  peripheral  IV  infusion  or  saline  lock,  and  over-sedation protocol on the AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent. (T-1) 3.4.2.12.  Self-medicating  patients  will  be  clearly  identified  and  must  have  “Self-Administering  Medication”  (SAM)  clearly  indicated  in  current  orders  and  “SAM”  box must be marked on the 3899A or EHR equivalentat the end of the sentence. (T-2) 3.4.2.13.  Nutritional status and diet orders. (T-2) 3.4.2.14.  Ambulatory status and/or physical limitations. (T-2) 3.4.2.15.  Travel limitations. (i.e., stops, RONs, cabin altitude restriction). (T-2) 3.4.2.16.  Patient equipment, but not limited to the following. (external fixators, epidural pain  pumps,  cardiac  monitors,  chest  tube  drainage  systems,  wheelchair  to  include dimensions, crutches). (T-2) 3.4.2.17.  Request  for  medical  attendants  (MA)  or  non-medical  attendants  (NMA)  or specialty medical teams. (T-2) 3.4.2.17.1.  The  attending  privileged  provider  may  request  MA  in  order  to  avoid  a decrement  in  the  level  of  care  during  transport.  Types  of  MAs  may  include  the following: 3.4.2.17.1.1.  ACLS credentialed. 3.4.2.17.1.2.  Specialty medical attendant team for ventilated patients (i.e., ERCC team). 3.4.2.17.1.3.  Privileged  providers,  obstetrical  nurses,  or  nurse  practitioners  for obstetric  patients  on  continuous  IV  medications  for  premature  labor  or  pre-eclampsia. 3.4.2.17.1.4.  Nurses or technicians (if the PMRC requests) i.e., neuropsychiatric AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 25 class 1A and 1B patients. 3.4.2.17.1.4.1.  Validation  must  look  carefully  for  signs  that  mental  health patients  may have a change of status during flight  that may directly  threaten the  aircraft  or  personnel  onboard.  The  most  helpful  information  to  the  VFS can be ascertained by asking the originating mental health and medical staff, “what has the patient actually said or done?” 3.4.2.17.1.4.2.  The  VFS  needs  to  know  if  the  patient  is  a  danger  to  self, others, or the aircraft/facility. 3.4.2.17.1.5.  Other  special  attendants  for  patients  whose  needs  exceed  the capabilities of the aeromedical evacuation crew. 3.4.2.17.2.  Non-Medical Attendants. A complete discussion of NMAs & MAs can be found in Section 6.5. 3.4.3.  Required information and documentation (i.e., scanned copies of passports, contractor letters of authorization) will vary by patient situation and theater of operation. Contact your servicing PMRC for detailed guidance. 3.5.  Determining Movement Precedence. 3.5.1.  Precedence  determines  how  quickly  the  patient  is  moved  by  the  patient  movement system.  Precedence  is  determined  by  the  clinical  requirement  for  saving  life,  limb,  or eyesight and must be consistent with the delivery date to the destination medical facility. (T-2)  The movement precedence is determined through consultation between the referring and accepting privileged provider. The TVFS and the PMRC make the final determination on the precedence. NOTE:  During contingency operations, additional information may be required as determined by the PMRC. Generally, patients may be regulated to the closest uniformed services treatment facility having the medical capability to care for the patient. 3.5.2.  Precedence categories are Urgent (“U”), Priority (“P”) and Routine (“R”). All “U” or “P” requests must be approved in accordance with PMRC guidelines. (T-2) 3.5.2.1.  If  a  request  for  “U”  or  “P”  movement  is  not  validated  and  the  referring privileged  provider  non-concurs  with  the  decisions,  he/she  can  request  a  review  by TCSG, the appropriate theater command surgeon, or designated representative. 3.5.2.2.  Report “U” and “P” patients directly to the PMRC with the help of the AE clerk or  patient  administration  personnel.  “U”  or  “P”  patients  require  direct  communication between the referring, accepting privileged providers and validating flight surgeon. 3.5.2.3.  “U” Precedence (stabilizing/unstable) requires immediate PM to save life, limb, eyesight,  or  prevent  serious  complications  of  injury  or  existing  medical  condition. Immediate  action  shall  be  taken  to  obtain  suitable  transportation  to  meet  patient requirements. (T-2)  Timeline for movement is as soon as possible and will be validated by supporting PMRC TVFS. (T-2) PM should commence within 12 hours of a validated patient movement request. 3.5.2.4.  “P”  Precedence  (stabilizing/stabilized)  requires  expedient  PM  and  prompt medical  intervention  when  care  is  unavailable  locally  and  medical  condition  could deteriorate; PM is required sooner than the next scheduled channel AE mission. Timeline 26 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 for  movement  will  be  defined  by  the  competent  medical  authority  and  validated  by  the supporting PMRC TVFS. (T-2) PM typically commences within 24 hours of a validated patient  movement  request,  but  may  be  modified  based  on  the  patient's  requirement  for next clinical intervention. 3.5.2.5.  “R”  Precedence  (stabilized/stable)  requires  timely  PM,  can  tolerate  longer periods  except  when  clinical  requirements/or  status  change  warrants  higher  movement precedence. Timeline for movement will be defined by competent medical authority and validated by the supporting PMRC TVFS. (T-2) PM typically commences within 7 days of  a  validated  patient  movement  request,  but  may  be  modified  based  on  the  patient's requirement for next clinical intervention. 3.5.2.6.  Response Time. 3.5.2.6.1.  Many  factors  influence  response  time  for  “U”  and  “P”  movements. Validation of the PMR by the PMRC is required before airlift will be allocated. (T-2) The  PMRC  provides  the  validated  PMR  to  the  appropriate  C2  agency  to  procure airlift. (T-2) 3.5.2.6.2.  The  618  AOC/AMD/AECT  will  consider  all  airlift  sources  to  include commercial  air  ambulances.  (T-2)  The  PMRC  will  consider  alternative  sources  of patient  movement  or  transport  if  airlift  response  time  does  not  meet  the  patient’s clinical needs. (T-2) 3.6.  Special Category Patients. 3.6.1.  A  special  patient  is  any  patient  who  can  be  considered  at  significant  risk  being aeromedically  evacuated.  To  designate  a  patient  as  “special”  is  a  matter  of  judgment  based on many factors. Among these are the patient’s clinical status and degree of stability, amount of  time  between  origination  and  destination  MTF,  and  duration  of  individual  missions  if more  than  one  is  needed  to  move.    Special  patients  can  be  designated  by  the  MCD/FN, Patient  Movement  Clinical  Coordinators  (PMCCs),  VFS  or  responsible  physician  and  must be coordinated through the PMRC. (T-2) 3.6.2.  Potential special category patients. 3.6.2.1.  Cardiac defibrillator/pacemaker. patients:   Cardiac  monitor for transport, implanted 3.6.2.2.  Do not resuscitate patients. 3.6.2.3.  Infants:    Less  than  10  lbs.  requiring  Airborne  Life  Support  System  (ALSS)  for temperature  control;  in  ALSS  for  other  than  temperature  control;  requiring  medical attendant; apnea monitor; pulse ox/cardiac monitor for flight; ventilator support. 3.6.2.4.  Blood  disorder  patients:  Hemoglobin less  than 7.0 (coordination required with TVFS),  sickle  cell  crisis,  patients  requiring  blood/blood  products  in-flight.    Refer  to paragraph 8.10. 3.6.2.5.  Communicable  disease  patients:    Tuberculosis  (TB)  with  less  than  2  weeks treatment with TB meds, MRSA/VRE (Methicillin [oxacillin])-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus/ Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus ) (must be briefed to the TVFS prior to any AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 27 validation),  Rule  out  clinical  (ROC)  indicators  list  for  potential  contagious  patient movements. (T-2) 3.6.2.6.  Dialysis patients. 3.6.2.7.  Continuous IV/Intrathecal Medications:  ICU (Intensive Care Unit) type IV drips (Dobutamine, Dopamine, etc.), heparin, insulin, epidural patients, nerve-block patients. 3.6.2.8.  Obstetric (OB) patients in active labor with a medical attendant. 3.6.2.9.  Orthopedic  patients  with  spinal  precautions  and/or  needing  a  Stryker frame/traction. 3.6.2.10.  Respiratory disorder patients: Ventilator patients. 3.6.2.11.  Specialized  team  patients:    ERCC,  extra  corporeal  membrane  oxygenation team, lung team, burn team, neonatal intensive care unit team. 3.6.2.12.  Special  operational  restrictions:    Urgent,  priority,  cabin  altitude  restriction, command  interest,  any  patient  O-6  or  higher  (active  or  retired),  E-9  depending  on position  (command),  foreign  national,  secretarial  designee,  or  any  other  high  visibility patient movement. Indicate the patient is a special patient in the PMR within TRAC2ES. 3.7.  Determining Patient Classification. 3.7.1.  Classification will be assigned by a referring privileged provider in coordination with the PMRC and designates the patient status, based on diagnosis and ability to self-help in an emergency. (T-2) The MCD may assign a higher (upgrade) classification, e.g. 2B to 2A if the patient’s condition warrants. 3.7.1.1.  A  patient’s  classification  will  not  be  downgraded  without  the  approval  of  the VFS  (i.e.  1A  to  1C).  (T-2)  Patient  status  changes  can  and  do  occur  after  the  initial reporting  of  patient  movement  requests.  All  medical  personnel  will  continuously  re-assess  and  document  patient  status  changes  and  ensure  updated  information  is communicated to the PMRC. (T-2) 3.7.1.2.  The  MCD  will  notify  C2  who  will  then  contact  the  governing  PMRC  of  any change  in  patient  status  or  classification  as  soon  as  possible.  (T-2)  Complete  DD  Form 2852,  Aeromedical  Evacuation  Event/Near  miss  Report,  and  update  AF  Form  3829, Summary  of  Patients  Evacuated  by  Air.  (T-2).  The  DD  Form  2852  is  protected  from disclosure  except  as  specified  in  10  U.S.C.  Section  1102,  Confidentiality  of  Medical Quality Assurance Records: Qualified Immunity for Participants. 3.7.2.  Psychiatric classifications. 3.7.2.1.  Patients are classified according to the severity of symptoms. (T-2) 3.7.2.2.  1A  and  1B  patients  must  have  standing  and/or  as  needed  (PRN)  medication orders for agitation/anxiety/sleep. (T-2) 3.7.2.3.  1A  –  Severe.  Psychiatric  litter  inpatient  requiring  the  use  of  restraining apparatus, sedation, close supervision, and will have a medical attendant. (T-2) 3.7.2.3.1.  Patients will have restraints on prior to boarding the aircraft, be sedated for flight and have close supervision. (T-2) 28 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 3.7.2.3.2.  Inspect  short  and  long  restraint  belts  and  wrist  and  ankle  cuffs  for  cuts, tears, or excessive wear. Assure there are compatible/operable restraint keys available and the caregivers know the location of the keys. Prior to take-off, verify the restraint key opens the locking device. (T-3) The patient’s restraints will not be attached to or around the litter itself. See Section 8.20.9. for guidelines. (T-3) 3.7.2.3.3.

The  user  interface  is  a  primarily  web-based  application  (T-Web),  but  a computer-based  interface  (T-Mobile)  exists  for  users  with  sporadic  or  non-existent  internet connectivity. The system is used by:  PMRCs, fixed and deployed MTFs, PM C2 elements, and the headquarters of Joint Task Forces, combined task forces, and CCDRs. For the latest information  regarding  TRAC2ES,  go  to  https://www.trac2es.transcom.mil/  or  email trac2es@us.transcom.mil. Users may apply for new accounts by contacting the TRAC2ES Helpdesk at:    transcom.scott.tcj6.mbx.service-desk@mail.mil. The help desk can provide them with the forms and guidance needed to fill out accounts. 3.11.2.  Regulated Patient Movement (PM). All service MTFs should report into TRAC2ES any  patient  who  requires  PM  beyond  a  100  mile  radius.  During  peacetime,  patients  are regulated  to  closest  MTF  capable  of  providing  required  care  and  disposition.  Patients originating outside CONUS who are not expected to return to duty and being separated from service  by  reason  of  disability  are  regulated  to  MTF  or  Veterans  Affairs  Medical  Center nearest  patients’  place  of  residence  with  medical  capability  to  care  for  the  patient.  Patients who  are  expected  to  return  overseas  are  regulated  to  the  MTF  nearest  to  the  port  of  entry. Hospitalized patients who are away from their duty station may be returned to a MTF nearest their  duty  station.  Patients  moving  through  the  AE  system  will  be  reevaluated/re-assessed post-flight at all interim locations by service staging or fixed-MTF FSs/privileged providers. (T-2) This will identify changes in clinical status and clear patients for onward movement. 3.11.2.1.  Standard  regulation.  This  process  selects  destination  MTFs  for  patients medically  evacuated  from  a  theater  of  operations.  It  provides  identification  of  and assignment to MTFs capable of providing required definitive, recuperative or restorative care to eligible beneficiaries. 3.11.2.2.  Open  regulation.  In  the  event  of  a  National  Emergency/Secretary  of  Defense (SecDef) designated military contingency where patient  movement  requirements exceed Federal/State, Military Health Services (MHS)/Health and Human Services (HSS) forces’ capabilities  to  appropriately  regulate  patients  to  a  preferred  or  Service  designated capability. TCSG shall, in coordination with the GCCs, through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, initiate “Open” regulation of patients, providing PM to the closest MTF in  any  GCCs  AOR.  (T-0)  TCSG/GPMRC  shall  provide  detailed  regulating  instructions (forms/format) for contingency “Open” regulation. (T-2) Normally this period of “Open” regulation  shall not  exceed seven (7) days without the coordination and approval  of the above agencies. (T-0) 3.11.2.3.  Through  regulation.  Upon  evaluation  by  competent  medical  authority, stabilized  patients  may  enter  the  joint  common  user  PM  system  near  the  first  level  of formalized  medical  care  and  be  evacuated  directly  to  a  definitive  care  capability  in another theater, or bypass interim levels of care if the patients’ clinical requirements do not require earlier intervention. Patients still receive care and are re-assessed. Exception:  When  patients  are  through-regulated  from  a  Joint  Operations  Area  (JOA),  the  JPMRC will assist the originating MTF with identifying the appropriate destination MTF. (T-2) 34 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 3.11.2.4.  Outpatient  regulation.  Outpatients  may  be  regulated  IAW  service  specific guidance. When outpatients are not expected to return to duty within a reasonable amount of time, or in the absence of theater specific guidance, outpatients should be regulated to the MTF located within the TRICARE area in which the patient is enrolled. This MTF is typically closest to their unit of assignment and has the capability to care for the patient’s clinical needs. The PMRC will also verify this information prior to validation. (T-2) 3.11.2.4.1.  Patients  not  requiring  in-flight  care  may  be  manifested  as  passengers  on the  passenger  manifest  through  the  passenger  terminal.  Patients  traveling  as passengers will not have an AF Form 3899, but will still be entered and validated in TRAC2ES as “no in-flight care required.” (T-2) 3.11.2.5.  Unregulated patient movement. Refer to JP 4-02. 3.11.3.  The PMRC provides the AOC with the PM requirement and the AOC will coordinate the  tasking  of  appropriate  aircraft  and  AE  assets  to  execute  an  AE  mission  for  regulated patients.  (T-2) The AOC gives approved mission information to the PMRC. (T-2) 3.11.4.

Documentation  requirements  are  defined  in  AFI  48-307  V3.  Send  all  pertinent records, X-rays, lab results, etc. with the patient. (T-2) The documents sent will be the only information available to  the physicians and nurses caring for the patient en route and at the destination if the information is not entered into the EHR. Consider both the care needed in the air and at interim stops. Documentation is required (at a minimum) upon admission, once per  shift,  and  upon  discharge  from  RON  location,  ERPS,  or  MTFs  at  a  minimum.  (T-2) Triage  starts  with  review  of  the  patient  manifest,  PMR,  and  continues  throughout  the patient’s arrival to facility and nursing hand-off. The FS, with assistance of the ERPS nurse, determines whether each patient can remain in the ERPS or must be transferred to the MTF for medical care. (T-3) 6.13.2.  When preparing patients for departure from the ERPS or MTF nurse will include the Patient Preparation Checklist. (T-2)  See Attachment 6. 6.13.3.

(T-3) 6.13.4.  All  medical  records,  X-rays,  medications  and  supplies  will  be  placed  in  a  secure records  container  and  transported  to/from  the  aircraft  by  medical  personnel.  (T-3)  The medical personnel will transfer the envelope/bag to the MCD or FN during patient hand off at  the  beginning  of  the  mission.  (T-3)  The  MCD/FN  will  transfer  the  envelope/bag  to  the appropriate  medical  ground  personnel  during  patient  hand  off  at  patient’s  point  of debarkation.  (T-3)  All  information  regarding  patient  information  must  follow  AFI  33-332, Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program. (T-1) 6.14.  Hand-off  Identify,  Situation,  Background,  Assessment,  and  Recommendation  (I-SBAR) AE/ERPS. 6.14.1.  Definition. Hand-off communication is an interactive process of effectively relaying current patient-specific information from one caregiver to another to ensure the continuity of patient  care.  Responsibility  for  the  care  of  the  patient  is  transferred  through  the  hand-off process  between  all  clinicians  (Physician,  Nurse,  MA,  etc.).  A  structured  communication technique or I-SBAR type hand-off brief will be used by all clinicians (Physician, Nurse, and MA). (T-2) NOTE: as time allows in a contingency. See attachment 7 & 8. 6.14.2.  During  the  exchange  of  patient  information,  limit  interruptions  and  distractions, allow  time  for  questions  and  responses,  and  provide  the  opportunity  to  review  relevant patient data. Critical information is verified by read back of the critical information. 6.14.3.  A verbal report will include, but is not limited to:  (T-2) 6.14.3.1.  Patient’s current condition, ongoing treatment, recent changes in condition, and any possible changes or complications to anticipate while the patient is in the AE system. 6.14.3.2.  Include  the  type  and  amount  of  IV  fluids/medication  ordered,  intake/output, current settings of medical devices including Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pumps. Include date/time IV fluids/medication were given. 6.14.3.3.  AE/patient  staging  personnel  will  ensure  the  AF  Form  3899  series  or  EHR equivalent  is  complete  and  supports  transfer  of  care  communications  between  AE personnel and the clinical representative assuming responsibility of care. (T-2) 6.14.4.  I-SBAR  is  a  mnemonic  for  Identify,  Situation,  Background,  Assessment,  and Recommendation. 6.14.4.1.  I  =  Identify: admission/transport.   Identify the  patient  by  name,  age,  sex,  reason  for 6.14.4.2.  S = Situation:  Briefly state the problem or chief complaint. Include when chief complaint began and the severity. Identify what is going on with the patient (chest pain, nausea, etc.). 6.14.4.3.  B  =  Background:    Pertinent  background  information  related  to  the  situation such  as:    admitting  diagnosis,  list  of  current  medications,  allergies,  intravenous  fluids (IVF), most recent VS, lab results, and code status. 6.14.4.4.  A = Assessment:  What is the nurse assessment of the situation? 60 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 6.14.4.5.  R  =  Recommendation:    What  is  the  recommendation  or  what  does  clinician want? 6.14.5.  The  hand-off  checklists  (see  attachments  7  &  8)  provide  a  structured  I-SBAR framework for giving a hand-off report in a concise and comprehensive manner. Other tools may be used in specific areas requiring certain types of information. This form is not a part of the  patient’s  permanent  medical  record.  On  the  reverse  side  is  a  checklist  to  ensure  the medication  supply,  equipment,  supplies  and  documentation  is  complete and  accompany  the patient.  When  a  patient  is  transferred,  the  transferring  clinician  should  start  and/or  update, sign and give the Hand-off Checklist tool to the receiving clinician. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 61 Chapter 7 FLIGHT PHYSIOLOGY AND STRESSES OF FLIGHT 7.1.  Flight Environment.  AE occurs in a physically constrained, relatively hypoxic, hypobaric, noisy,  vibrating,  unclean  environment  with  wide temperature  shifts  differing  significantly  from the  MTF.  Physical  stresses  during  flight  affect  not  only  every  patient’s  physiology  and psychology, but can impair medical providers’ abilities to assess and deliver care while airborne. Patients in the AE environment are susceptible to physiologic stresses encountered at altitude. 7.2.  Gas Laws  . 7.2.1.  Dalton’s Law:  The law of partial pressure. Dalton’s gas law states the total pressure of  a  mixture  of  gases  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  partial  pressures  of  each  gas  within  the mixture.  Barometric/atmospheric  pressure  is  the  pressure  exerted  against  an  object  by  the atmosphere. Therefore, as altitude increases and barometric pressure decreases and there is a corresponding  decrease  in  the  partial  pressure  of  inspired  oxygen,  even  for  patients  on ventilators  with  100%  O2.  Oxygen  concentration  remains  21%  regardless  of  altitude. Barometric pressure multiplied by the concentration of gas is equal to the partial pressure of the  gas.  As  altitude  increases,  the  partial  pressure  of  a  gas  decreases.  The  actual  available oxygen  decreases  with  altitude  because  oxygen  molecules  move  farther  apart,  possibly resulting  in  hypoxia.  As  pressure  decreases,  O2  has  a  harder  time  crossing  into  the  blood stream,  resulting  in  a  decreased  O2  saturation  (SpO2)  of  the  blood.  For  example,  at  an altitude  of  10,000  ft.,  partial  pressure  of  oxygen  in  arterial  blood  (PaO2)  would  measure approximately 51mmHg, yielding a SpO2 of approximately 84% in a healthy individual. 7.2.2.  Charles’ Law:  When the pressure is constant, the volume of gas is proportional to its temperature.  Likewise,  if  volume  remains  constant,  the  pressure  on  the  gas  varies  directly with  temperature.  During  flight,  temperature  decreases  an  average  of  3.5  Fahrenheit  or  2 Celsius per 1000 ft., therefore, ambient temperature for an aircraft flying at 35,000 ft. can be expected to be near -57F. Such a reduction in temperature will result in a significant drop in oxygen  tank  pressure  if  exposed;  conversely  oxygen  tank  pressure  can  be  expected  to  rise with significant increases in ambient temperature. 7.2.3.  Henry’s  Law:    The  principle  of  evolved  gas  disorders.  The  solubility  of  gases  in liquids:    The  quantity  of  gas  dissolved  in  1  milliliter  (ml)  of  a  liquid  is  proportional  to  the partial  pressure of  gas in contact  with  the liquid. The weight  of  gas dissolved in  a liquid  is directly proportional to the weight of the gas above the liquid. An example is shaking a can of soda and opening it immediately. The balance of pressure is altered, releasing the bubbles of gas in the soda. During a rapid decompression the same principle applies where nitrogen bubbles are released into the blood following the dramatic changes in aircraft pressurization. This  relationship  explains  why  dissolved  nitrogen  transitions  to  a  gas  phase  in  blood  and tissues during decompressions. 7.2.4.  Boyle’s  Law:    The  principle  of  gas  expansion.  Boyle’s  Law  states  at  a  constant temperature,  the  volume  of  gas  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  pressure.  During  ascent (decompression),  gasses  expand  and  during  descent  (recompression),  gasses  contract.  For instance,  a  climb  to  flight  level  180  from  sea  level  (SL)  results  in  a  50%  reduction  in  total barometric  pressure  accompanied  by  a  50%  increase  in  gas  volume.  However,  the  constant 62 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 pressure (47 millimeter of Mercury [mmHg]) of water vapor within the body contributes to physiological  gasses  expanding  at  a  slightly  greater  rate  than  atmospheric  gasses  therefore resulting in a 50% increase in gas volume at 16,500 feet (1,500 feet. lower than atmospheric gasses). One example is the volume of gas in a balloon will expand at altitude. 7.2.5.  Graham’s  Law:    The  law  of  gaseous  diffusion.  Gases  flow  from  higher  pressure  (or concentration)  to  a  region  of  lower  pressure  (or  concentration).  Simple  diffusion  or  gas exchange at the cellular level is an example. 7.3.  Physiological Stressors of Flight.  The stressors of flight can be broadly categorized into 2 classes:    those  which  can  quickly  incapacitate  the  patient  and  crew  and  those  which  can aggravate  medical  conditions.  In  certain  age  groups,  (e.g.,  neonates)  irritant  stressors,  such  as extreme cold, can be life threatening. The patients’ ability to withstand the physiologic effects of flight  stressors  will  vary  depending  upon  their  underlying  disease  processes  and  their  age. Patients  are  exposed  to  barometric  pressure  changes,  decreased  partial  pressure  of  oxygen, decreased  humidity,  temperature  variations,  high  noise  levels,  vibration,  travel  fatigue  and gravitational-forces. 7.3.1.  Barometric Pressure Changes (Boyle’s Law). Gas volume changes are physiologically significant  in  AE.  The  mechanical  effects  of  expansion  and  contraction  can  exert  a differential pressure on the surrounding tissues, which can cause severe, potentially disabling pain and potential physical damage to tissues (e.g. ear, sinus, GI tract, and lungs). 7.3.1.1.  A cabin de-pressurization may result in decompression sickness. 7.3.1.2.  If  a  patient  experiences  adverse  symptoms  related  to  barometric  pressure changes, the clinician should document the maximum cabin altitude (MCA) at the time of the incident. 7.3.2.  Decreased  Partial  Pressure  of  Oxygen  (Dalton’s  Law).  Dalton’s  Law  more significantly  affects  patients  with  cardiac  disease,  pulmonary  disease,  anemia,  trauma,  and increased  intracranial  pressure.  These  patients  may  quickly  experience  vital  end-organ dysfunction when exposed to altitude hypoxia, and will require supplemental oxygen therapy as ordered. 7.3.2.1.  Increased oxygen or delivery pressures may be required when at altitude. 7.3.2.2.  If  a  PRN  order  for  oxygen  is  not  in  place  and  supplemental  oxygen  is  needed, begin supplemental oxygen, call C2 and the PMRC to obtain an order as soon as possible and initiate a DD Form 2852. (T-2) If an ERCC team doctor is on board, they can write the order but  also  notify C2.  (T-2)  NOTE:   A pulse oximeter is  available on board AE aircraft,  but  referring  privileged  providers  must  recognize  these  devices  can  give erroneously higher readings under certain physiologic conditions (i.e., carbon monoxide poisoning, dehydration, anemia, impaired peripheral circulation, and high or low cardiac output states).   NOTE:  A cabin altitude restriction is sometimes required in addition to supplemental oxygen therapy. NOTE:  Flying at lower altitudes may decrease speed and increase  fuel  consumption;  however,  rapid  transportation  to  definitive  care  takes precedence.See  Chapter  8  for  additional  cabin  altitude  restrictions  and  AE  Clinical Protocol – Emergency Oxygen. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 63 7.3.3.  Decreased  Humidity.  The  partial  pressure  of  water  (i.e.,  humidity)  of  cabin  air decreases as altitude increases. When air is cooled, it loses its ability to hold moisture. Air at altitude  is  cold,  possessing  very  little  moisture  (i.e.  the  higher  the  altitude,  the  colder  and drier  the  air  is).  The  fresh  air  supply  is  drawn  into  the  aircraft  cabin  from  a  very  dry atmosphere. Extended flying time magnifies the drying effects of exposure to altitude. 7.3.3.1.  Cabin  humidity  can  be  less  than  three  percent  (3%)  toward  the  end  of  a  long mission.  Resulting  dehydration  and  thickened  secretions  can  affect  pulmonary  patients. Use humidification bottles for all patients receiving oxygen to keep the secretions loose in the lower respiratory tract. 7.3.3.2.  Patients  with  fluid  balance  problems,  (e.g.  patients  with  renal  and  cardiac diseases or respiratory compromise), are at significant risk and should have strict intake and outputs ordered (oral or IV). Plan to provide hydration to all patients as required. 7.3.3.3.  Wounds  requiring  moist  packing  may  dry  out  quickly  during  airlift.  Treatment orders need to specify wound care objectives such as reinforcing dressings and providing additional solutions to the wound. 7.3.3.4.  Nothing  by  mouth  (NPO)  patients  must  have  more  attention  paid  to  hydration status  via  IVF.  (T-3)  Their  IVF  rates  would  need  to  be  slightly  increased,  compared  to usual MTF rates. (T-3) 7.3.4.  Temperature  Variations.  An  increase  in  altitude  results  in  a  decrease  in  ambient temperature.  Aircraft  cabin the temperature outside the aircraft. Temperature fluctuations on the flight line and in the aircraft can be extreme. temperature  fluctuates  considerably  depending  on 7.3.4.1.  Patients with burns/skin-damage, who are critically ill, sedated, mentally altered, elderly,  or  infants  can  succumb  to  hypothermic  conditions  that  may  often  occur  on military aircraft. 7.3.4.2.  An  air  worthy  certified  incubator  can  be  used  to  provide  warmth  for  infants under 10 pounds. 7.3.4.3.  Blankets and warm clothing should be available in flight. Prior to the flight, the originating facility should ensure the patients are dressed and covered for warmth while in-flight. 7.3.4.4.  When  traveling  at  extreme  temperatures,  monitor  portable  oxygen  source pressures. 7.3.5.  High Noise Levels. Noise is a problem in all aircraft. To reduce gross weight and thus maximize  fuel  savings,  military  aircraft  are  not  equipped  with  noise  shielding  materials found on modern civilian commercial aircraft. 7.3.5.1.  Noise  interferes  with  the  ability  of  providers  to  assess  VS,  auscultate  and communicate  with  patients  including  deescalating  /monitoring  psychiatric  patients,  and detecting equipment alarms while on board the aircraft. 7.3.5.2.  Patients,  passengers,  crews,  and  attendants  will  be  provided  hearing  protection prior to flight. (T-3) Alternate methods of communication may be required. 64 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 7.3.6.  Vibration.  When  the  human  body  is  in  direct  contact  with  a  source  of  vibration, mechanical energy is transferred, which is degraded into heat within those  tissues that have dampening properties. The response to whole body vibration is an increase in muscle activity both to maintain posture and to reduce the resonant amplification of body structures. This is reflected  in  an  increase  in  metabolic  rate,  a  redistribution  of  blood  flow  with  peripheral vasoconstriction, and increased oxygen requirements.  The increase in  metabolic rate during vibration  is  comparable  to  that  seen  in  gentle  exercise,  and  respirations  are  increased  to achieve the necessary elimination of increased carbon dioxide. Additionally, disturbances in visual acuity, speech, and fine-muscle coordination result from vibration exposure. 7.3.6.1.  Vibration  may  cause  increased  pain  for  orthopedic  fracture  patients  and  many painful  disorders.  Orthopedic  patients  often  benefit  from  pain  medication  administered during  preflight,  before  exposure  to  vibration.  Additional  padding/cushioning  of stabilizing  devices  (i.e.  casts,  external  fixators,  braces)  and  supportive  techniques  can help relieve discomfort from vibration. 7.3.6.2.  Equipment can be affected by vibration and settings require close monitoring. 7.3.6.3.  Originating privileged providers should provide a pain control regime to include PRN orders. 7.3.7.  Turbulence. Turbulence can be produced by high and low temperature changes in the outside  air.  Turbulence  increases  stress  during  flight  by  promoting  fatigue  and  increasing susceptibility to motion sickness and disorientation. 7.3.7.1.  Turbulence  may  easily  overwhelm  and  incapacitate  someone  suffering  from other  medical  conditions,  (e.g.  chemotherapy  patients,  pregnant  patients  experiencing nausea  and  vomiting,  or  patients  prone  to  motion  sickness).  PRN  anti-emetic  order  is recommended.  In  the  event  nausea  and  vomiting  are  already  preset,  the  patient  will  be medicated prior to arrival at the aircraft and have PRN orders written. 7.3.7.2.  All  patients,  equipment,  and  supplies  should  be  secured  IAW  AFI  11-2AE  V3 and AFI 10-2909. 7.3.8.  G-Forces. The effects of G-Forces involve an understanding of the concepts of exerted forces. Speed, velocity, weight, mass and the laws of motion are among those considerations. Specific  perils  from  the  effects  of  G-Forces  can  include  deterioration  of  vision  and disturbances  of  consciousness  related  to  high-performance  aircraft.  Newton’s  First  Law  of Motion states unless acted upon by a force, a body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in motion will move at constant speed in a straight line. 7.3.8.1.  Findings,  such  as  increased  intracranial  pressure  (ICP),  pregnancy,  unstable fractures  and  blood  pooling  are  conditions  to  consider  when  examining  effects  of  G-Forces  in  AE.  To  reduce  the  effects  of  G-forces,  extra  padding  may  be  used  on  the abdomen and seat belt for small children, pregnant women, and patients with abdominal surgery.  Patients  with  head  injuries  may  be  loaded  head  forward  and  facing  aft  at  the discretion of the VFS or ERCC team physician when applicable. 7.3.9.  Fatigue.  All  the  stresses  of  flight  induce  fatigue  to  some  degree  and  are  an  inherent stress  in  the  AE  environment.  Erratic  schedules,  multiple  platforms  over  several  days, AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 65 hypoxic environment, noise, vibration, and imperfect environmental systems will eventually take their toll. 7.3.9.1.  Travel  through  multiple  time  zones  may  cause  bodily  circadian  rhythm disruption  or  jet  lag,  also  characterized  by  symptoms  of  fatigue  and  irritability.  Order "litter for comfort" for patients who cannot tolerate prolonged sitting. 7.3.9.2.  Consider the following human systems factors which may lead to stress/fatigue. The acronym DEATH may assist in remembering the factors. 7.3.9.2.1.  D  rugs.  Use  of  over-the-counter (OTC)  medications,  misuse  of prescription medications, and use of stimulants such as caffeine can cause insomnia, tremors, indigestion, and nervousness. 7.3.9.2.2.  E  xhaustion.  Exhaustion  can  lead  to  judgment  errors,  limited  response, falling asleep, channeled attention, and changes in circadian rhythm. 7.3.9.2.3.  A  lcohol.  Using  alcohol  may  cause  histotoxic  hypoxia,  which  is  a deficiency  of  oxygen  reaching  the  bodily  tissues  due  to  impairment  of  cellular respiration  especially  by  a  toxic  agent  such  as  alcohol.  Histotoxic  hypoxia  affects efficiency of cells to utilize oxygen, interferes with metabolic activity, and can result in a hangover. 7.3.9.2.4.  T  obacco. Besides exposing the body to tar, nicotine and carcinogens, the average  smoker  will  normally  have  5 involved  as carboxyhemoglobin.  This  results  in  hypemic  hypoxia  (reduces  the  oxygen  carrying capacity  of  the  blood)  and  lowers  altitude  tolerance.  Flying  at  a  cabin  altitude  of 10,000 ft. with 10% carboxyhemoglobin is physiologically equivalent to 15,000 ft. to  10  %  hemoglobin 7.3.9.2.5.  H  ypoglycemia. Poor dietary intake can cause nausea, headache, dizziness and judgment errors. 66 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 8 PATIENT CARE RESPONSIBILITIES 8.1.

The AECM will document the use of any AE Clinical Protocol in the AF Form 3899 series  or  the  EHR  equivalent  if  one  is  available.  (T-2)  All  documentation  will  include  the statement “ IAW AE Clinical Protocol - XXX”. (T-2) In addition,  the AECM will complete the DD Form 2852. (T-2) Documentation and process improvement requirements specific to the AE Clinical Protocol are included in the applicable section of this AFI. 8.2.  Preflight  Assessment  and  Report.  Patient  acuity,  mission  requirements,  and  the  setting will  determine  how  extensive  this  process  will  be.  Tactical  and  peacetime  patient  information flow is variable. Obtain as much history as possible from the patient, PMR, and patient records using the I-SBAR format found in Attachment 7 & 8. (T-2) 8.2.1.  In the AE environment, the primary assessment skills are inspection, auscultation, and palpation.  Primary  and secondary trauma  assessment skills  are used to  quickly identify  and treat  life-threatening  conditions.  NOTE:    Auscultation  is  not  reliable  during  in-flight assessments. 8.2.1.1.  During flights shorter than 45 minutes, as appropriate and per diagnosis, or if the patient  has  restraints/constrictive  devices,  clinicians  will  do  the  following:    assess  for food/medication  allergies,  immediate  patient  concerns/interventions  required,  suicidal ideations/homicidal  ideations,  VS,  pain  level,  sedation  score  (refer  to  Table  8.9.), circulation, motor and sensory function. (T-3)  NOTE:  Operational constraints may limit completion of these tasks. (T-1) 8.2.1.1.1.  Clinicians will assess patients for abnormal respiratory findings to include respiratory adjuncts. (T-1) 8.2.1.1.2.  Clinicians will assess patient’s ability or inability to self-medicate, and any other clinical findings suggesting a decreased sensorium and/or altered judgment. (T-1) 8.2.2.  Primary  Survey.  Accomplished  when  the  patient  is  initially  seen  by  medical personnel,  such  as  at  a  first  aid  station,  MTF,  ERPS  or  at  the  flight  line.  Life  threatening conditions  are  identified  and  management  begins.  Ensure  this  is  done  prior  to  flight. Reassessment of circulation, airway, and breathing is ongoing. 8.2.2.1.  Circulation. 8.2.2.2.  Airway. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 67 8.2.2.3.  Breathing:  Ventilation and oxygenation. 8.2.2.4.  Disability:  Brief neurologic examination. 8.2.2.4.1.  Level of consciousness (LOC). 8.2.2.4.1.1.  The  following  is  a  MNEMONIC  for  differentiating  the  causes  and treatment coma/unresponsiveness: 8.2.2.4.1.1.1.

Exposure/environment:  If condition and situation warrants, completely undress the patient. Prevent hypothermia, if possible. 8.2.3.  General appearance: 8.2.3.1.  The  patient’s  body  position  noting  posture  and  any  guarding  or  self-protection movements. 8.2.3.2.  Observe for stiffness, rigidity, or flaccid muscles. 8.2.3.3.  Observe  unusual  odors  such  as  alcohol,  gasoline,  chemical,  vomitus,  urine  or feces. 8.2.4.  Secondary  survey.  This  assessment  is  a  brief,  systematic  process  to  identify  ALL injuries,  obtain  history  and  mechanism  of  injury  as  well  as  maintaining  core  body temperature, obtaining a complete set of VS, temperature, pulse oximetry, and the insertion of adjuncts such as a urinary catheter and nasogastric tube, as required. 8.2.4.1.  Full VS (blood pressure [BP], pulse, respirations, pulse oximetry, temperature), pain level, history, cardiac monitor and pulse oximeter applied as necessary. comfort  measures 8.2.4.2.  Give pharmacologic/non pharmacologic). (verbal reassurance,  pain assessment, and 8.2.4.3.  History and head--toe assessment (if condition and situation warrants). 8.2.4.4.  Include face, neck, chest, pelvis/abdomen, extremities. 8.2.4.5.  Inspect back and posterior surfaces. 68 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.2.4.6.  Refer  to  current  Trauma  Nurse  Core  Course  (TNCC)  if  available  and    current AHA ACLS guidelines for more in-depth information on practices and assessment skills. 8.2.5.  Ongoing  assessment/re-assessment.  Reevaluate  the  patient  noting,  reporting,  and documenting  any  changes  in  the  patient’s  condition  and  responses  to  resuscitative  efforts. Time, personnel and environment will determine this re-evaluation process. 8.3.  General Nursing Care. 8.3.1.  A  plan  of  nursing  care  is  developed  or  modified  using  the  patient’s  chart  and  other information,  to  assure  continuity  of  care.  The  patient  should  be  observed  throughout  all phases  in  the  AE  system.  An  appropriate  level  and  type  of  medical  and  psychological  care measures should be rendered as described in each medical system. 8.3.2.  Maintain strict patient confidentially (on a need-to-know basis), as related to HIPAA rules and regulations, in reviewing or releasing any medical information. 8.3.3.  Patient  comfort  . If the ambient temperature exceeds a comfortable level, the MCD will  speak  with  the  PIC  and  or  the  Loadmaster/Boom  Operator  to  correct  the  temperature. (T-0) 8.3.3.1.  Latrine  facilities.  Inform  litter  patients  that  urinals,  bedpans,  and  modesty curtains  are  available.  Ensure  patients  have  the  opportunity  to  use  the  restroom  before being transported to the aircraft and prior to critical phases of flight. 8.3.4.  Oral hygiene  . Dried secretions that accumulate on the tongue and palate reduce oral sensitivity  and  promote  bacterial  growth.  Mouth  care,  especially  for  debilitated  patients,  is essential  because  of  the  reduced  humidity  in  the  aircraft  cabin.  Comatose,  paralyzed,  and other patients at risk should have mouth care at least every 2 hrs. NOTE:  When a toothbrush and  toothpaste  is  contraindicated,  disposable  foam  swabs  make  an  acceptable  substitution. Patients  who  are  NPO  may  be  given  mouthwash  for  swish  and  spit  and  mouth/  lip moisturizer. 8.3.5.  Position  changes  .  Any  position,  even  the  most  comfortable  one,  may  have  an adverse  effect  on  a  patient  over  time.  A  patient’s  movements  may  be  limited  by  disease, injury,  or  helplessness.  Position  changes  promote  comfort  and  relaxation,  prevent  skin breakdown, and improve gastrointestinal and respiratory function. 8.3.5.1.  Position changes should be done at least every 2 hrs. Straps/stanchion arms can be adjusted 2 inches up or down to allow for position changes to reduce pressure points on  litter  patients.  A  blanket  roll,  lift  sheets  or  backrest  may  also  assist  in  shifting  the patient’s weight and keeping heels off the litter to relieve pressure. 8.3.5.2.  Range of motion exercises should be utilized whenever possible. 8.3.6.  The Braden Scale is used throughout the DoD Medical Service to identify patients at risk  for  developing  skin  breakdown  or  pressure  ulcers.  Factors  predisposing  a  patient  to develop  pressure  ulcers  include:    decreased  mobility,  activity,  and  sensory  perception; increased  moisture,  friction,  and  shear  forces;  and    intrinsic  factors  influencing  tissue tolerance  associated  with  age,  nutrition,  and  tissue  perfusion.  The  Braden  Scale  uses  these factors to provide a score 6-23. AECMs and ERPS staff will be familiar with these scores for purposes  of  awareness  and  documentation  during  hand-offs  from  MTFs  and  the  need  for AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 69 intervention to minimize pressure ulcer development or worsening during flight.  (T-3)    See Attachment 9. 8.3.7.  Patient ambulation. Encourage ambulation every 2 hours to prevent VTE  for patients whose condition allows. Ambulatory patients should be encouraged to stand up and stretch to promote circulation to the extremities. Litter patients should ambulate, if possible, assisted to the lavatory and allowed to sit in a seat. Ensure adequate pain control. Any complaints of calf tenderness or new posterior leg pain must be evaluated for VTE pre/post transport. (T-1) See Section 8.6. 8.3.8.  Reduce  fatigue.  All  patients  are  susceptible  to  the  effects  of  fatigue.  Litter  patients require  special  planning  and  care  to  reduce  fatigue.  NOTE:    Nursing  interventions  can  be accomplished  to  counter  these  stresses  of  flight.  Provide  ear  plugs,  blankets  and  pillows. Dimming  the  lights  in-flight  provides  an  atmosphere  for  sleep  and  relaxation.  An uncomfortable position may hinder sleep more than the vibration and noise of the engines. 8.3.9.  Skin  care.  Disposable  washcloths  are  available  and  can  be  placed  in  a  plastic  bag, dampened  with  hot  or  cold  water,  and  distributed  to  the  patients.  Antiseptic  towelettes  or liquid hand sanitizer are made available and offered before meals  and after a patient uses a urinal, bedpan or latrine. 8.3.10.  Monitor I&O as condition warrants. 8.3.10.1.  Intake:    All  those  fluids  entering  the  patient's  body  such  as  oral  fluids,  ice chips, parenteral, intravenous fluids, feeding tubes, irrigation and blood transfusion. 8.3.10.2.  Output:    All  fluid  that  leaves  the  client's  body  such  as:    urine,  diarrhea, vomiting, and, drainage from all tubes and bleeding. 8.4.  Airway and Respiratory Management. 8.4.1.  Stresses of flight affecting airway and respiratory management. 8.4.1.1.  Decreased  partial  pressure  of  oxygen:    Exacerbates  possible  oxygenation deficiencies due to a compromised respiratory system and diminished ciliary action. 8.4.1.2.  Barometric  pressure  changes:    May  cause  spontaneous  pneumothorax  in  a trauma  patient  with  significant  respiratory  compromise.  GI  gas  expansion  may  cause diaphragmatic crowding leading to lower tidal volumes. 8.4.1.3.  Thermal:    Both  an  increase  or  decrease  in  body  temperature  increases  the metabolic  rate  and  O2  demand  on  the  body  (particularly  true  in  ventilator  dependent patients). 8.4.1.4.  Decreased  humidity:    The  effectiveness  of  ciliary  action  is  decreased,  resulting in thickened secretions. 8.4.1.5.  Fatigue:   Most patients with respiratory disorders are already fatigued from the added workload of breathing. The overall effect  of the previously mentioned stresses of flight and the total length of time in the AE system may increase fatigue  and exacerbate the patient’s condition. 70 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.4.1.6.  Gravitational  Forces:   The  positive  gravitational  forces  generated  on takeoff/ascent  may  cause  diaphragmatic  crowding,  fatigue  and  exacerbate  the  patient’s condition. 8.4.2.  Assessment of respiratory status: 8.4.2.1.  Determine  the  mechanism  of  injury  or  disease.  Look,  listen  and  feel  for indicators  requiring  possible  intervention.  The  flight  environment  may  preclude auscultation. If appropriate, obtain a baseline oxygen saturation. 8.4.2.2.  Assess and document the following as dictated by the patient’s condition: 8.4.2.2.1.  Respiratory rate, depth, symmetry, oxygen saturation and MCA. 8.4.2.2.2.  Document if any of the following abnormal findings are present: 8.4.2.2.2.1.  Any use of accessory muscles, intercostal and substernal retractions, stridor,  nasal  flaring,  pursed  lip  breathing,  prolonged  expiration,  skin  color  and position of patient. 8.4.2.2.2.2.  Tongue obstructing the airway in an unconscious victim. 8.4.2.2.2.3.  Loose teeth and/or other foreign objects. 8.4.2.2.2.4.  Facial and/or oral bleeding. 8.4.2.2.2.5.  Facial  fractures  resulting  in  loss  of  maxillary  and  mandibular structural integrity. 8.4.2.2.2.6.  Inhalation injury or nasal/mucosal charring. 8.4.2.2.2.7.  Tracheal edema. 8.4.2.2.2.8.  Hematomas,  bruising,  wounds,  and  crepitus  of  the  neck  and  upper chest. 8.4.2.2.2.9.  Position of trachea (midline or deviated). 8.4.2.2.3.  Glasgow  Coma  Scale  (GCS):    A  score  of  less  than  8  may  suggest concurrent findings of hypoxia and require intubation. 8.4.2.2.3.1.  GCS – Best eye opening 8.4.2.2.3.1.1.  Spontaneous = 4 8.4.2.2.3.1.2.  To speech = 3 8.4.2.2.3.1.3.  To pain = 2 8.4.2.2.3.1.4.  No response = 1 8.4.2.2.3.2.  GCS – Best verbal response 8.4.2.2.3.2.1.  Oriented = 5 8.4.2.2.3.2.2.

Severe  respiratory  distress  or  status  epilepticus  may  require  sedation  or paralyzing  agents  to  secure  airway.  NOTE:  The  AE  in-flight  kit  does  not  contain paralytic drugs. 8.4.3.  Preflight/in-flight considerations and care for respiratory patients. 8.4.3.1.  Assure sufficient O2 is available in all phases of transport (including portable for ground  transport  if  required).  NOTE:    See  AFI  10-2909,  Aeromedical  Evacuation Equipment Standards for oxygen calculations and planning factors. 8.4.3.2.  Maintain a patent airway with positioning, suctioning, and adequate humidified oxygen. NOTE:  Administer oxygen for any signs of hypoxia and respiratory distress or significant change from original assessment. 8.4.3.3.  Respiratory disease pathologies may  require additional  preflight  evaluation  and possible cabin altitude restriction. Some of the more common diagnoses include, but are not limited to: 8.4.3.3.1.  Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease pulmonary emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and status asthmaticus. (COPD).  COPD includes 8.4.3.3.2.  Restrictive  lung  disease:    Extensive  pneumonic  consolidation,  aspiration pneumonia,  pulmonary  atelectasis  and  infarction,  pulmonary  contusions,  acute respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS),  pulmonary  edema,  and  hemothorax  and/or pneumothorax. 8.4.3.3.3.  Any disease or physiological process dependent upon oxygen delivery such as  extensive  tumors,  granulomatous  processes,  lymphatic  spread  of  carcinoma, diffuse parenchymatous diseases, alveolar proteinosis, sarcoidosis, interstitial fibrosis, shock, cardiac disease and traumatic brain injury (TBI). 8.4.3.4.  Cabin  altitude  restriction  and  supplemental  oxygen:    The  decision  for  cabin altitude restriction or supplemental oxygen will be based on individual patient needs, the VFS orders, and the following considerations (T-2): 8.4.3.4.1.  Most AE aircraft (C-17 and KC-135) cruise with a cabin altitude of 6,000 – 8,000 ft. At a 7,000 ft. (T-2)  altitude, a healthy person’s PaO2 is 60 mmHg or about 90  percent  saturation.  (T-2)  Patients  with  a  sea  level  PaO2  below  60  mmHg  (90 percent  saturation)  will  potentially  have  difficulty  with  hypoxic  hypoxia  while  in-flight. (T-2) 72 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.4.3.4.2.  Patients with COPD should be administered low flow oxygen therapy (1 to 2 liters per minute via nasal cannula [NC] or Venturi mask) to avoid suppression of their  hypoxic  drive.      (T-0)  Closely  monitor  respiratory  rate  if  receiving  higher concentrations of O2. (T-0) Request lower cabin altitude if unresponsive to high flow O2 and operationally feasible. (T-0) Complete DD Form 2852. (T-2) 8.4.4.  Urgent airway management. 8.4.4.1.  Airway obstructed or partially obstructed: 8.4.4.1.1.  Position  patient  to  allow  for  maximum  ventilation.  Consider  a  backrest  if not contraindicated. 8.4.4.1.2.  Open  and  clear  the  airway  (use  airway  adjuncts  IAW  current  AHA  BLS and ACLS standards). 8.4.4.1.3.  Suctioning (do not invoke a gag reflex). treatment/management: 8.4.4.2.  Advanced  airway   In  general,  advanced  airway procedures  such  as  oral/nasal  intubation,  cricothyrotomy,  and  tracheostomy  procedures will  not  normally  be  performed  by  AECMs.  Specially  trained  healthcare  professionals, working  within  their  AFSC  scope  of  practice,  may  perform  those  procedures.  The specially  trained  healthcare  professional  will  be  aware  of  the  indications,  risks,  and potential complications prior to performing the procedure in the AE environment.  (T-0) The benefits of the procedure must outweigh the risks of not performing the procedure in the  AE  system.  Any  change  in  a  patient’s  status  will  be  reported  to  C2  for  further guidance. (T-1) DD Form 2852 will be submitted. (T-1) 8.4.5.  General clinical guidelines for all respiratory patients. 8.4.5.1.  Refer to Table 8.1. for O2 delivery methods. Table 8.1.  O2 Delivery Methods. (American Heart Association [AHA], ACLS Provider Manual, Current Edition ).  METHOD  Liters Per Minute (LPM)  O2%  NC Low flow-O2 delivery mixes with ambient gas.

Administer 10-15 LPM via a tight-fitting mask for patients who require a rapid clinical effect/high-flow O2.   NOTE:  Requires close monitoring for nausea and vomiting. Suction should be readily available.  Venturi Mask Use for patients who retain CO2. Initially use 24%, unless otherwise ordered, and observe for respiratory depression.  > 90%       24  28  35  40  8.4.5.2.  In the most serious cases, give high flow O2 @ 100% via non-rebreather mask or BVM. 8.4.5.3.  Deliver  humidified  O2  whenever  possible.  Monitor  sterile  water  levels  in humidification bottles. 8.4.5.4.  Monitor pulse oximetry (O2 saturation) and titrate O2 up or down accordingly to maintain at least 92%. 8.4.5.5.  In  patients  with  low  hemoglobin  states,  supplemental  O2 should be  ordered  per Table 8.2. Table 8.2.  Oxygen Requirements for Low Hemoglobin States.

Conversion for In-flight Oxygen Administration. 8.4.5.6.1.  These  parameters  are  based  on  hemoglobin  because  hematocrit  may  be decreased or elevated in dehydration or fluid overload. 8.4.5.6.2.  If not contraindicated, push oral fluids to prevent dehydration.  8.4.5.7.  Pulmonary hygiene measures. 8.4.5.7.1.  Assist  into  sitting  position  (if  not  contraindicated);  position  on  a  backrest (if available). 8.4.5.7.2.  Turn,  cough,  and  deep  breathe  every  2  hrs.,  and  note  color,  amount  and consistency of secretions (i.e., soot, blood streaks, and clots). 8.4.5.7.3.  Incentive spirometry if available every 1-2 hrs. while awake. 8.4.5.7.4.  Use a pillow for abdominal/thoracic splinting when coughing. 8.4.5.7.5.  If breathing is ineffective or absent,  follow current  AHA ACLS and  BLS guidelines. 8.4.6.  Hyperventilation. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 75 8.4.6.1.  An abnormal increase in the rate and depth of breathing. Although unrelated in cause,  the  symptoms  of  hyperventilation  and  hypoxia  are  similar  and  often  result  in confusion and inappropriate corrective procedures. Contributing factors can be related to psychological stress, medications, physiological changes, and stresses of flight. 8.4.6.2.  Treatment for hyperventilation: 8.4.6.2.1.  At  altitude,  the  treatment  of  hyperventilation  and  hypoxia  for  the  AE patient  is  similar.  Refer  to  AE  Clinical  Protocol  –  Emergency  Oxygen  and encourage deep breathing. Refer to Attachment 2,  A2.1.1. 8.4.6.2.2.  When  a  patient  is  hyperventilating  from  anxiety,  putting  on  a  mask  to administer oxygen may heighten anxiety. 8.4.6.2.3.  Methods  to  reduce  the  patient’s  respiratory  rate  include  counting  to  5 slowly while exhaling, working with the patient to control inhalations and exhalations to  only  10  times  a  minute.  Give  the  patient  a  watch  with  a  second  hand,  or  a  cell phone with a stop watch, and instruct them to maintain a respiratory rate between 10 and 12 breaths per minute. 8.4.7.  Hypercapnia: 8.4.7.1.  Refers to increased amounts of CO2 in the blood. CO2 accumulates in the blood due  to  poor  alveolar  ventilation.  As  the  O2  in  the  blood  is  lowered,  the  CO2  is  raised. Altitude can exacerbate hypercapnia. The increased CO2 stimulates the respiratory center in the brain stem. Elevated CO2 is a powerful vasodilator, producing both peripheral and cranial  vasodilatation.  Any  condition  causing  poor  alveolar  ventilation  can  result  in hypercapnia. 8.4.7.2.  Signs/symptoms  of  hypercapnia: symptoms include; hypotension, coma, and cardiac failure.   Headache,  vertigo,  hypertension.  Late 8.4.7.3.  Pathological states primarily producing hypercapnia: (barbiturates, 8.4.7.3.1.  Central  nervous  system.  Pharmacological  depression narcotics,  alcohol,  and  tranquilizers),  cerebrovascular  accident,  meningitis  and encephalitis, severe intracranial hypertension associated with trauma, and tumors. 8.4.7.3.2.  Diseases  of  nerves  and  muscles:    Guillain-Barre’  syndrome,  muscular dystrophy,  myasthenia  gravis,  insecticide  poisoning,  tetanus,  chronic  progressive polyneuropathy, diptheritic polyneuritis, iatrogenic hemidiaphragmatic paralysis from indwelling interscalene pain catheters, and poliomyelitis. 8.4.7.3.3.  Diseases of the chest wall:  Flail chest and kyphoscoliosis. 8.4.7.3.4.  Metabolic  diseases:    Severe  hypothyroidism,  starvation,  obesity,  and electrolyte imbalance. 8.4.7.3.5.  Pulmonary  causes:    Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (emphysema and  chronic  bronchitis);  acute  obstructive  disease;  severe  asthmatic  disease;  acute bronchiolitis;  mechanical  obstruction  such  as  blood;  water;  pus;  pulmonary  edema; massive  parenchymal  lung  disease;  restrictive  disease  of  the  pleura;  severe  pain  or diaphragmatic embarrassment after surgery; mechanical obstruction of large airways; 76 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 upper respiratory obstruction; abdominal compartment syndrome; and obstruction of trachea or large bronchi. 8.4.8.  Care/management of endotracheal (ETT) tube and tracheostomy patients. 8.4.8.1.  Patients requiring artificial airway management should have extra airways with them. 8.4.8.2.  Attach an approved end-tidal CO2 monitoring device or an in-line CO2 indicator to the ET or tracheostomy tube. 8.4.8.3.  The ERCC team may elect to fill endotracheal and tracheostomy tube cuffs with air  and  then  attach  to  a  cuff  pressure  monitor  to  minimize  tissue  trauma  and  the complications of re-intubation. 8.4.8.3.1.  Cuff  pressure  is  usually  maintained  between  15-20  cm,  and  will  be checked preflight, at cruise and hourly, on descent, and prior to deplaning. Document cuff pressures on patients medical record. (T-1) 8.4.8.3.2.  If  an  ERCC  team  is  unavailable  and  an  ETT  or  tracheostomy  tube  cuff requires  inflation  for  flight,  ensure  it  is  inflated  with  air.    Use  minimal  occlusion volume/minimal leak technique in an effort to permit adequate ventilation and avoid tissue trauma.   WARNING:  Excessive pressure in the endotracheal or tracheostomy cuffs may decrease blood flow to tissue causing airway damage, while under inflation may  permit  air  leak/ineffective  ventilation  and  increased  potential  for  aspiration  of upper  airway  secretions.8.4.8.4.    Tracheostomy  patients  may  require  warmed humidification during AE. 8.4.9.  Ventilator patients. 8.4.9.1.  Only  approved  or  waived  ventilators  will  be  used  for  AE  missions.  (T-1) AECMs are responsible for ensuring the ventilator interfaces with aircraft systems and a dedicated regulator/oxygen line is available to operate ventilators. 8.4.9.2.  Assure  adequate  portable  oxygen  is  available  for  all  phases  of  transport including enplaning and deplaning. 8.4.9.3.  Set up for ventilated patients: 8.4.9.3.1.  During  transport  an  emergency  oxygen  line  for  any  vented  patient  is attached  to  a  personal  bag  valve  mask  (BVM).  The  BVM  will  be  kept  on  the  litter (normally  under/behind  backrest)  connected  to  the  oxygen  unless  using  the  oxygen line for an in-line respiratory treatment. (T-1) 8.4.9.3.2.  Cardiac monitor. 8.4.9.3.3.  Pulse oximetry. 8.4.9.3.4.  CO2 monitor. 8.4.9.4.  General nursing care for ventilated patients. 8.4.9.4.1.  Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is any pneumonia occurring in the patient  who  is  intubated  or  who  was  extubated  within  the  past  48  hrs.  Follow  the current clinical practice guidelines to prevent and mitigate VAP. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 77 8.4.9.4.2.  VS at least q 2 hrs. 8.4.9.4.3.  Oral care q 2 hrs. 8.4.9.4.4.  Nasogastric/oral gastric (NG/OG) tube inserted. 8.4.9.4.5.  Raise head-of-bed 30 degrees, unless contraindicated. 8.4.9.4.6.  Soft wrist restraints in  place to  prevent  extubation  or inadvertent  removal of vital therapeutic devices. 8.4.9.4.6.1.  Every 1 hr. restraint assessment and circulation will be documented. (T-1) 8.4.9.4.6.2.  Reevaluate  the  patient  and  ventilator  settings  at  altitude;  changes  at altitude may require ventilator-setting adjustments. 8.4.9.4.6.3.  Positive  end-expiratory  pressure  (PEEP)  settings  will  typically remain constant at altitude. 8.4.9.4.7.  Administer pain and sedation medication, as ordered, for patient comfort. 8.4.10.  Chest tubes. 8.4.10.1.  Chest tubes may be left in position for AE. Either a chest drainage unit with an integral one-way valve (e.g. Atrium Express 4050) or a Heimlich valve will be in place prior to patient transfer to the flight line. (T-0) The Heimlich valve may be utilized with a chest drainage system without a one-way valve system. Glass chest tube drainage bottles will  not  be  used  in-flight.        (T-1)  WARNING:  Use  of  the  Heimlich  valve  with  the Atrium  Express  could  cause  great  risk  to  a  patient  during  rapid  decompression.  Do  not obstruct the positive pressure relief valve. 8.4.10.2.  Chest  drainage  units  listed  in  the  current  AE  Equipment  Standards  are approved for use in-flight; ensure familiarity with conditions for use. Other drainage units may be encountered in the AE system and may be acceptable if a one-way valve system is  present,  conditions  for  use  are  followed,  and  a  waiver  is  obtained  IAW  AFI  10-2909 and 11-2AE V3. A DD Form 2852 is completed on all equipment requiring a waiver. (T-2) 8.4.10.3.  Patients may be airlifted 24 hrs. after chest tube removal. 8.4.10.3.1.  A  chest  x-ray,  anterior/posterior  and  lateral,  with  interpretation,  will  be completed post chest tube removal and documented in the patient’s medical records. (T-0) 8.4.10.3.2.  Patients  requiring  AE  before  24  hrs.  will  be  approved  by  the  referring provider and the TVFS. (T-2) 8.4.10.3.3.  Occlusive  dressing  is  applied  to  the  site  where  the  chest  tube  was removed. 8.4.10.4.  Preflight/in-flight considerations and care for chest tube patients. 8.4.10.4.1.  Patient  assessment  will  include;  assessing  breath  sounds,  VS  with  pulse oximetry,  and  inspection  of  the  chest  tube  site  to  ensure  intact  dressing  and connections for any leaks or kinks. (T-0)  Assess tidaling in the chest drainage device. 78 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 In  a  patient  with  a  pleural  chest  tube,  tidaling  is  normal.  Oscillations  are  more apparent  when suction is  momentarily turned off.  If there is  no tidaling, consider 1) an  occlusion  somewhere  between  the  pleural  cavity  and  the  water  seal,  2)  a  full expansion  of  the  lung  where  suction  has  drawn  the  lung  up  against  the  holes  in  the chest  tubes,  or  3)  PEEP,  which  can  dampen  oscillation.  WARNING:    Check  chest tubing for occlusion and assess patient for bilateral rise and fall of chest wall. 8.4.10.4.2.  Ensure  all  connections  are  taped,  tubing  is  not  looped  or  kinked  or hanging below the drainage system. 8.4.10.4.3.  Mark level of collection chamber. 8.4.10.4.4.  Document presence or absence of an air leak in the water seal (bubbling indicates free air in the pleural cavity). 8.4.10.4.5.  Do not allow the chest drainage system to be above the level of the chest. 8.4.10.4.6.  Position  patient  mid-tier  or  above  to  facilitate  drainage.  Patients  with chest tubes should not be floor-loaded. 8.4.10.4.7.  The  chest  tube  will  only  be  clamped  when  changing  the  chest  tube drainage unit or discontinuing the chest tube unless directed by a privileged provider. (T-0) If directed by the privileged provider, a Kelly clamp will accompany the patient while in the AE. (T-0) 8.4.10.4.8.  Maintain and document I&O on each leg of the mission on the AF Form 3899E or EHR equivalent and as required. 8.4.10.4.9.  Check  the  suction  control  frequently  and  adjust  the  suction  control  to maintain the appropriate amount of suction according to the physician’s order.  If the chest  drainage  system  uses  water  to  maintain  suction,  adjust  suction  control  for minimal bubbling according to manufacturer’s recommendations. 8.4.10.4.9.1.  Ensure  patient  is  utilizing  an  incentive  spirometer  (IS)  and/or coughing and deep breathing every 1-2 hours while in-flight. 8.4.10.4.10.  Move  and  drain  chest  drainage  tubing  hourly  to  facilitate  flow  and prevent  clotting.  WARNING:    If  clotting  is  suspected,  do  not  milk  or  strip  chest tubes;  this  has  the  potential  to  causes  increased  intra-pleural  pressure.  If  you  see visible clots, squeeze hand-over-hand along the tubing and release the tubing between squeezes to help move the clots in the drainage unit. 8.4.10.4.11.  Unless contraindicated, position on a backrest for comfort. 8.4.10.4.12.  Pain medication as required. 8.4.11.  Pulmonary emergencies. 8.4.11.1.  Initial response to pulmonary emergencies. 8.4.11.1.1.  Maintain  the  airway  and  assist  breathing  IAW  current  AHA  ACLS guidelines. 8.4.11.1.2.  Administer high flow O2 to maintain pulse oximetry greater than 92%. 8.4.11.1.3.  Establish IV access. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 79 8.4.11.1.4.  Call C2; the airlift agency will contact the governing PMRC for guidance, possible  cabin  altitude  restriction,  and  diversion  to  a  MTF  capable  of  handling  the situation, as required. (T-0) 8.4.11.2.  Asthma/COPD. 8.4.11.2.1.  Assess signs and symptoms: 8.4.11.2.1.1.  Tachypneic, labored respirations with increased effort on exhalation (prolonged). 8.4.11.2.1.2.  Possible cough and dyspnea. 8.4.11.2.1.3.  Signs of hypoxia. See Table 8.4. 8.4.11.2.1.4.  The absence of wheezing, difficulty speaking, and use of accessory muscles indicates an emergent situation. 8.4.11.2.2.  Emergency  treatment/management:    Refer  to  AE  Clinical  Protocol  - Emergency Oxygen. 8.4.11.2.3.  Administer medication and oxygen as directed. 8.4.11.2.3.1.  The  goal  of  oxygen  administration  for  a  COPD  patient  is  to maintain  adequate  arterial  blood  saturation  with  oxygen  (SaO2)  without worsening acidosis. WARNING:   Patients  with  chronically  elevated blood  CO2 levels  may  rely  on  relative  hypoxia  as  a  respiratory  driver.  Titrating  O2  outside ordered SpO2 parameters may  result in  decreased respiratory  drive.  In a  clinical emergency,  high  flow  oxygen  may  be  required.  Patients  receiving  high  flow  O2 will require full time observation. (T-1) 8.4.11.2.3.2.  Encourage  oral/by  mouth  (PO)  fluids  or  consider  IV  maintenance fluids, if not contraindicated. 8.4.12.  Tension pneumothorax. 8.4.12.1.  Air enters the pleural space and is unable to escape. This may occur as a result of  trauma,  complication  of  medical  treatment/procedure  or  spontaneous.  Tension pneumothorax  may  also  be  due  to  a  kinked  or  clotted  chest  tube.  The  involved  lung collapses  and  the  mediastinum  shifts  to  the  opposite  side,  compressing  the  contralateral lung. Venous return to the heart is decreased and cardiac output is dramatically reduced. 8.4.12.2.  Tension pneumothorax signs and symptoms: 8.4.12.2.1.  Hypoxia. See Table 8.4. 8.4.12.2.2.  Severe  respiratory  distress  with  dyspnea  (air  hunger  and  rapid respirations) and cyanosis. 8.4.12.2.3.  Decreased or absent chest expansion on affected side. 8.4.12.2.4.  Diminished or absent breath sounds on affected side. 8.4.12.2.5.  Difficulty ventilating patient with ETT. 8.4.12.2.6.  Presence of clots in the chest tube or Heimlich valve. 8.4.12.2.7.  Hyper-resonance on percussion. 80 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.4.12.2.8.  Subcutaneous emphysema. 8.4.12.2.9.  Distended neck veins and hypotension. 8.4.12.2.10.  Tracheal shift to unaffected side (late sign). 8.4.12.3.  Tension pneumothorax treatment/management: 8.4.12.3.1.  If  this  is  assessed  and  not  previously  treated  preflight,  the  patient  is  not stable for flight. 8.4.12.3.2.  If chest tube is present: 8.4.12.3.2.1.  Assure the drainage system is operational. 8.4.12.3.2.2.  WARNING  :    If  clotting  is  suspected,  do  not  milk  or  strip  chest tubes; this has the potential to causes increased intra-pleural pressure. If you see visible  clots,  squeeze  hand-over-hand  along  the  tubing  and  release  the  tubing between squeezes to help move the clots in the drainage unit. 8.4.12.3.3.  If chest tube is not present, or if the chest tube is not patent or operable, pressure must be relieved immediately by a needle decompression. 8.4.12.3.3.1.  A  14-gauge  needle  is  inserted  over  the  top  of  the  third  rib into  the 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line on the affected side. WARNING: The vascular bundle lies underneath the rib.  Lacerating the vasculature can lead to  life  threatening  intra-thoracic  hemorrhage.    Refer  to  current  AHA  ACLS  and TNCC guidelines. 8.4.12.3.3.2.  Continue to assess patient. Decompression may have to be repeated until a chest tube is inserted. 8.4.12.3.3.3.  Decrease the cabin altitude, if operationally feasible. (T-0) 8.4.12.3.3.4.  Contact C2; the airlift agency will contact the governing PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation. (T-0) 8.4.12.3.3.5.  Continue  to  closely  monitor  the  pulse  oximeter  and  patient  for reoccurrence. 8.4.13.  Open  pneumothorax.  Air  enters  the  chest  via  an  open  wound;  also  known  as  a “sucking chest wound.” 8.4.13.1.  Open pneumothorax:  Signs and symptoms: 8.4.13.1.1.  Severe respiratory distress with dyspnea and cyanosis. 8.4.13.1.2.  Gurgling, sucking wound. 8.4.13.1.3.  Tachypnea and grunting. 8.4.13.2.  Open pneumothorax:  Treatment/management: 8.4.13.2.1.  Treat by applying an occlusive dressing completely over the defect during expiration. 8.4.13.2.2.  Allow  the  casualty  to  adopt  the  sitting  position  if  breathing  is  more comfortable. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 81 8.4.13.2.3.  Monitor for possible development of subsequent tension pneumothorax. 8.4.13.2.4.  If  signs  of  a  tension  pneumothorax  develop,  REMOVE  the  occlusive dressing for a few seconds and allow the tension pneumothorax to decompress. If this does not resolve the issue, then refer to tension pneumothorax. 8.4.14.  Massive hemothorax. 8.4.14.1.  Signs and symptoms: 8.4.14.1.1.  Severe respiratory distress with dyspnea. 8.4.14.1.2.  Signs  of  shock  (section  8.8.)  and  hypoxia  (section  8.5.).  Refer  to  AE Clinical Protocol – Emergency Oxygen. 8.4.14.1.3.  Breath sounds decreased or absent. 8.4.14.1.4.  More than l00ml of blood loss per hr. from chest tube. 8.4.14.1.5.  Traumatic injury to the chest. 8.4.14.2.  Massive hemothorax:  Treatment/management. 8.4.14.2.1.  Treat shock as appropriate. 8.4.14.2.2.  Chest  tube  placement  is  required.  Seek  immediate  assistance  from  a privileged provider/C2/PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation. (T-0) 8.4.15.  Flail chest. 8.4.15.1.  Multiple rib  fractures  resulting in  loss  of chest  wall stability. Normal  thoracic function  and  gas  exchange  are  impaired.  The  underlying  pulmonary  contusion  and splinting of the fracture pain leads to hypoventilation and hypoxia. The flailing segment moves inward during inspirations and outward during expiration. Severe muscle spasms may conceal the flailing segment. 8.4.15.2.  Flail chest:  Signs and symptoms. 8.4.15.2.1.  Respiratory distress with dyspnea, cyanosis, and hypoxia. 8.4.15.2.2.  Paradoxical chest wall movement. 8.4.15.2.3.  History of blunt trauma to the chest. 8.4.15.3.  Flail Chest: Treatment/management. 8.4.15.3.1.  Supplemental oxygen. Evaluate for elective intubation. 8.4.15.3.2.  Adequate pain management. See Section 8.21. 8.4.15.3.3.  Position  for  comfort.  NOTE:    Place  on  affected  side  if  in  respiratory distress to improve oxygenation of unaffected lung. 8.4.15.3.4.  Monitor IVF infusion to avoid fluid overload. 8.4.15.3.5.  Pulmonary failure may require emergent intubation. 8.4.15.3.6.  May have PEEP or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure. 82 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.4.16.  ARDS. 8.4.16.1.  Lung injury with  several  causes  and may  be a  complication of  other diseases, injuries, volume overload, infection, toxic inhalation, massive transfusion, etc. 8.4.16.2.  ARDS  results  from  a  severe  alteration  in  pulmonary  vascular  permeability, which  leads  to  a  change  in  lung  structure  and  fluid  shift  to  interstitial  space  (edema). Interferes with alveolar-capillary membrane affecting ventilation. 8.4.16.3.  ARDS:  Treatment/management. 8.4.16.3.1.  Supplemental oxygen/ventilator support. 8.4.16.3.2.  PEEP (if required). 8.4.16.3.3.  Monitor continuous pulse oximetry saturations. 8.4.16.3.4.  Fluids should be restricted unless shock is present. 8.4.16.3.5.  Turn  patient  every  2  hrs.  unless  contraindicated  to  promote  postural drainage. 8.5.  Hypoxia: 8.5.1.  Hypoxia  is  a  general  term  describing  an  oxygen  deficiency  in  the  tissues  sufficient enough to cause impairment of function. Oxygen deficiency can result from various causes. AE patients are already in a compromised state, are at a higher risk and may experience signs of  hypoxia  faster  than  normal.    Administer  oxygen  for  any  sign  of  hypoxia,  respiratory distress  or  significant  change  from  original  assessment.  Base  the  treatment  on  underlying pathology, preflight VS and pulse oximetry. 8.5.2.  Stages of altitude induced hypoxia. 8.5.2.1.  Indifferent  stage:    Starts  at  sea  level  and  extends  to  10,000  ft.  The  body  reacts with  a  slight  increase  in  heart  rate  and  ventilation.  Night  vision  begins  to  diminish  at 5,000 ft. 8.5.2.2.  Compensatory stage:  Extends from 10,000 ft. to 15,000 ft. The body attempts to protect  itself  against  hypoxia  by  increasing  BP,  heart  rate,  and  the  rate  and  depth  of respiration.  Efficiency  and  performance  of  tasks  requiring  mental  alertness  becomes impaired. 8.5.2.3.  Disturbance  stage:    Extends  from  15,000  ft.  to  20,000  ft.  Characterized  by dizziness, sleepiness, tunnel vision, and cyanosis. Thinking becomes slowed and there is a loss of muscle coordination. 8.5.2.4.  Critical stage:  Extends from 20,000 ft. to 30,000 ft. Marked mental confusion, incapacitation followed by unconsciousness. 8.5.3.  Major causes of hypoxia in the AE environment: 8.5.3.1.  High altitude:  Altitude is the most common cause of in-flight hypoxia. 8.5.3.2.  Hypoventilation:    Hypoventilation  is  inadequate  ventilation  often  caused  by diseases outside the respiratory system  and  can  exist  when lung tissue is  normal.  Over-sedation is a common cause of hypoventilation. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 83 8.5.3.3.  Lung  pathology:    Conditions  of  the  lungs  producing  arterial  hypoxia  in  the presence  of  normal  alveolar  PaO2  is  termed  “increased  alveolar-arterial  oxygen  tension difference.” Three mechanisms contribute to this condition: 8.5.3.3.1.  Diffusion  defect:    Interference  with  diffusion  of  oxygen  from  alveolar  air into  pulmonary  blood  results  in  lowered  PaO2.  This  is  seen  in  diffuse  pulmonary infiltration,  interstitial  fibrosis,  early  edema,  viral  pneumonia,  sarcoidosis,  and anemia. 8.5.3.3.2.  Abnormal perfusion-ventilation ratio:  An important aspect of normal lung physiology  is  local/regional  optimization  of  alveolar  perfusion  based  on  the ventilation  of  the  alveolar-capillary  units.  In  certain  lung  diseases  there  is  a breakdown of this optimization with a resulting deterioration in gas exchange. This is seen  in  patients  with  pulmonary  emphysema,  status  asthmaticus,  pulmonary  edema, pulmonary embolus, and chronic bronchitis. 8.5.3.3.3.  Intrapulmonary  shunts:    When  the  ventilation/perfusion  ratio  is  abnormal due to poor ventilation of the alveoli, the blood passes through the involved parts of the  lung  without  the  oxygen-carbon  dioxide  exchange  occurring.  For  example,  in lobar  pneumonia,  the  blood  passes  directly  from  the  pulmonary  arterial  circulatory system into the pulmonary venous system without a gas exchange. 8.5.4.  Types of hypoxia: 8.5.4.1.  Hypoxic  hypoxia  (altitude  hypoxia):    Caused  by  exposure  to  the  airborne environment.  Results  in  deficiency  in  alveolar  oxygen  exchange.  A  lower  barometric pressure at altitude results in a decrease in alveolar PaO2 and interferes with ventilation and perfusion. Any condition requiring oxygen at sea level must be closely monitored at altitude. See Figure 8.1. (T-0) Figure 8.1.  Altitude Blood Oxygen Saturation. Altitude Blood Oxygen Saturation Sea level 98% 10,000 ft. 87% 22,000 ft. 60% 8.5.4.2.  Hypemic  hypoxia:    A  reduction  in  the  oxygen-carrying  capacity  of  the  blood caused  by  anemia,  hemorrhage,  hemoglobin  (Hgb)  abnormalities  (e.g.  sickle  cell disease),  medications  (e.g.  sulfanilamides,  nitrites),  or  chemicals  (e.g.  cyanide,  carbon monoxide). WARNING:  Carbon monoxide has a 200 x greater affinity to bond to Hgb than oxygen. Pulse oximetry reading may not be accurate in carbon monoxide poisoning. 8.5.4.3.  Histotoxic  hypoxia:    A  deficiency  of  oxygen  reaching  the  tissues  due  to impairment of cellular respiration especially by a toxic agent such as alcohol. Histotoxic hypoxia affects efficiency of cells to utilize oxygen, interfere with metabolic activity. 8.5.4.4.  Stagnant  hypoxia:    A  reduction  in  total  cardiac  output  due  to  the  pooling  of blood and the reduced blood flow to the tissues. Interferes with the transportation phase of  oxygen  by  reducing  systemic  blood  flow.  Causes  include:    Respiratory  failure, continuous  positive  pressure,   ventilation,  positive  end  expiratory  pressure, 84 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 cardiovascular and/or pulmonary embolus (blood clot or gas bubbles), shock, acceleration (G-Forces),  extremes  in  environmental  temperature,  postural  changes,  tourniquets, arterial spasm, hyperventilation, and heart failure. 8.5.5.  Characteristics of hypoxia: 8.5.5.1.  Generally, patients are not familiar with their personal symptoms of hypoxia, so AECMs  must  be  alert  to  all  possible  signs  and  symptoms  patients  may  exhibit.  (T-0) Because AE patients are already in a compromised state, they will usually experience the effects of hypoxia earlier than normal. Signs and symptoms are listed in Table 8.4.  8.5.5.2.  Cyanosis is a late sign of hypoxia because the oxygen saturation must be below 75% in persons with normal Hgb before it is detectable. Table 8.4.  Signs and Symptoms of Hypoxia. Signs Restlessness Slouching Euphoria Confusion Stupor Dyspnea Belligerence Tachypnea Hypertension Tachycardia Bradycardia Arrhythmias Hypotension (late) Cyanosis (late) Seizures (late) Unconsciousness(late) Symptoms Confusion Headache Dizziness Euphoria Blurred Vision Tunnel Vision Insomnia Hot and cold flashes Tingling Numbness Nausea Anger Tachypnea Short of breath Changing judgment or personality   8.5.6.  Due to the relative hypoxic environment in AE aircraft, patients having diagnoses or conditions which compromise tissue oxygenation should be considered candidates for either oxygen  supplementation  or  a  cabin  altitude  restriction,  or  both.  The  attending  physician,  in consultation  with  the  VFS,  should  consider  prescribing  supplemental  oxygen  and/or  cabin altitude restriction and document these orders in the patient movement request and AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent. 8.5.7.  Prevent  hypoxia  by  encouraging  deep  breathing  and  ambulation,  if  appropriate. Evaluate potential causes of hypoxia:  medications, underlying medical conditions, etc. 8.5.8.  Treatment of hypoxia. Refer to AE Clinical Protocol – Emergency Oxygen. 8.5.8.1.  Request lower cabin altitude if unresponsive to high flow O2 and operationally feasible. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 85 8.5.8.2.  When administering O2 to correct hypoxia, allow approximately 3-5 minutes to elapse for a more accurate pulse oximeter reading. 8.5.9.  Documentation will include subjective and objective data for giving oxygen; VS, date, time and delivery method of administering the oxygen (i.e. non-rebreather mask at 15 lpm or nasal-cannula  at  4  lpm),  notification  of  a  physician,  and  the  outcome.  (T-0)  The  following statement  will  be  documented  on  AF  Form  3899  or  EHR  equivalent.  (T-1)  “Oxygen  was administered  IAW  AE  Clinical  Protocol  –  Emergency  Oxygen.  (T-2)  Completion  of  the DD Form 2852. (T-1) 8.5.10.  Performance Improvement (PI) Monitoring will include: 8.5.10.1.  Hypoxia  is  identified  and  treated  within  the  parameters  of  the  AE  Clinical Protocol. 8.5.10.2.  AOC/AECT is notified and VFS is made aware. 8.5.10.3.  Treatment is documented on the patient’s AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent. 8.5.10.4.  DD Form 2852 is completed. (T-2) 8.6.  PE/VTE Events During AE. 8.6.1.  PE  is  the  obstruction  of  one  or  more  pulmonary  arteries  by  a  thrombus  usually originating in the deep veins of the legs. VTE occurs when a blood clot forms in a person’s veins. 8.6.2.  Stresses of flight contributing to PE/VTE events 8.6.2.1.  Thermal: Excessive heat will lead to additional dehydration 8.6.2.2.  Decreased  humidity:  Leads  to  dehydration.  Dehydration  effects  the  flow  of venous blood volume and may cause additional stasis. 8.6.2.3.  Fatigue:  Excessive fatigue may cause patients  to  be static for longer periods of time. They may not have the energy to walk or complete the recommended movements or exercises. 8.6.2.4.  G-forces: May cause additional venous stasis, leading to pooling of the blood. 8.6.2.5.  Flights lasting longer than 4 hours compound the other stresses of flight. 8.6.3.  Higher  risk  for  PE/VTE  includes  patients  with:    Prolonged  bed  rest,  long  bone  or pelvic  trauma,  obesity,  history  of  smoking,  history  of  thromboembolic  disease,  varicose veins,  pregnancy,  post-partum,  history  or  family  history  of  PE/VTE,  estrogen  use,  heart failure, myocardial infarction, active cancer, recent surgery, leg cast or splint and/or over the age of 40. 8.6.4.  PE signs and symptoms. 8.6.4.1.  Dyspnea,  pleuritic  chest  pain,  wheezing,  crackles  on  auscultation,  restlessness, and hemoptysis. NOTE: In-flight auscultation is not a reliable assessment tool. 8.6.4.2.

The  MCD  will  contact  C2  immediately;  the  airlift  agency  will  contact  the governing PMRC for guidance. (T-0) 8.6.5.  VTE signs and symptoms: 8.6.5.1.  Pain  in  the  calf  or  behind  the  knee  that  may  increase  with  standing  or ambulating, the feeling of being on pins and needles, swelling (especially unilateral), skin that is warm to touch, erythema, and a systemic temperature greater than 100.4F. Many VTEs are asymptomatic. 8.6.5.2.  Homan’s  sign  is  often  unreliable  due  to  false  positives.  It  is  no  longer recommended. 8.6.5.3.  VTE  prophylaxis  is  essential  to  preventing  complications  of  immobility  in  the AE system. Prophylactic methods or measures may include: 8.6.5.3.1.  Frequent  ambulation,  if  possible,  as  well  as  stretching  and  flexing  of  calf muscles.  Adequate  hydration  and  frequent  changes  in  position  are  required throughout the AE system. 8.6.5.3.2.  Sequential  Compression  Devices  (SCD)  or  foot  pumps  provide  non-pharmacologic  VTE  prophylaxis  in  critical  care  and  immobilized  patients.  Some patients  being  transported  benefit  from  use  of  a  combination  of  non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis. Approved SCDs in the AE environment may be used on one or more extremities and provides improved benefit over no  mechanical prophylaxis. 8.6.5.3.3.  VFS may consider heparin, low molecular weight heparins (e.g. Lovenox) or warfarin (e.g. Coumadin). 8.7.  Cardiovascular Management. 8.7.1.  Stresses of flight affecting the cardiovascular system.   Increases  myocardial  workload, 8.7.1.1.  Decreased  partial  pressure  of  oxygen: predisposing  compromised  patients  to  arrhythmias,  chest  pain  and  may  lead  to myocardial infarction. Consider cabin altitude less than 6,000 ft. for cardiac patients. 8.7.1.2.  Barometric  pressure  changes:    Gas  expansion  in  the  GI  tract  may  cause diaphragmatic crowding and decrease in tidal volume. 8.7.1.3.  Thermal:    Excessive  heat  may  cause  patients  on  cardiac  medication  to  become hypotensive. Hyperthermia and hypothermia may increase cardiac oxygen requirements. 8.7.1.4.  Fatigue:  Cumulative effect of stresses may exacerbate the patient’s condition. 8.7.1.5.  G-forces:    Ascent  may  increase  returning  blood  flow  and  cardiac  workload  for some cardiac patients. Use a backrest for cardiac patients on a litter. 8.7.2.  Preflight/in-flight considerations for cardiac patients. 8.7.2.1.  Use  alternate  anti-hijacking  procedures  for  patients  and  passengers  with implantable cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators. WARNING:  EMI from handheld and stationary surveillance systems interferes with these medical devices. Changes in pacing rates, shock, and possible cardiac arrest may occur. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 87 8.7.2.2.  Patients  with  a recent  acute  myocardial  infarction  are  considered  for  AE  on  an individual  basis.  The  referring  privileged  provider  and  VFS  will  work  together  to determine the appropriate AE precedence and clinical support for cardiac patients.  (T-2) When  continuous  cardiac  monitoring  or  other  critical  care  modalities  are  required,  the VFS, in consultation  with the referring privileged provider, shall determine if an ERCC team or medical attendant such as a physician or ACLS trained nurse will accompany the patient.  (T-2) The final  decision for determining these requirements rests with the VFS. A  12-Lead  electrocardiogram  taken  within  24  hrs.  of  scheduled  flight  and  read  by  a qualified physician should accompany the patient. 8.7.2.3.  Patient history. associated  with  dyspnea,  nausea 8.7.2.3.1.  Assess if patient is free of chest pain.  Document the last episode and if it was and/or  diaphoresis.  Note  what actions/medications  were  used  to  relieve  pain/discomfort.  List  other  current medications, allergies, and presence of pacemaker or other implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. 8.7.2.3.2.  Assess ability to ambulate for prolonged periods and climb stairs. 8.7.2.3.3.  All inpatient cardiac patients should have preflight VS and pulse oximetry; repeat VS and pulse oximetry at altitude. 8.7.2.3.4.  If  the  patient  has  nitroglycerin,  ensure  it  is  not  expired  and  the  patient notifies the AECM if consumed. 8.7.2.4.  Use a backrest if on litter. 8.7.2.5.  Place near O2 for flight. 8.7.2.6.  The cardiac monitor, if ordered, should be placed in  a viewable position for an ACLS certified member in all phases of transport when feasible. 8.7.3.  Cardiac emergencies/cardiac arrest:  ERCC team/MA may be included in the medical emergency  procedures  if  clinically  qualified  to  assist.

Treatment and Management of Ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia. 8.7.9.1.  Refer  to  current  AHA  ACLS  guidelines.  AECMs  refer  to  AFI  11-2AE  V3  and AFI 10-2909 for information specific to defibrillation on an aircraft. 8.7.10.  Treatment and Management of Asystole and Pulseless Electrical Activity. 8.7.10.1.  Refer to current AHA ACLS guidelines. 8.8.  Shock Management  . 8.8.1.  Stresses of flight affecting shock. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 89 8.8.1.1.  Decreased  partial  pressure:    As  altitude  increases,  ambient  air  pressure decreases, leading to a decrease in the oxygen tension which results in a decreased PaO2. 8.8.1.2.  Thermal: temperature extremes.   Inadequate  peripheral  perfusion  aggravated  by the  potential 8.8.1.3.  Humidity:    The  humidity  in  aircraft  cabins  is  extremely  low  and  exacerbates fluid loss. 8.8.1.4.  Fatigue:  Can exacerbate the patient’s underlying condition/diagnosis due to the overall  effect  of  stresses  of  flight  and  length  of  time  the  patient  has  been  in  the  AE system. Disruption of circadian rhythms occurs when crossing multiple time zones. 8.8.2.  General:    Shock  is  a  physiologic  state  characterized  by  a  significant  reduction  of systemic tissue perfusion, resulting in decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues. This creates an  imbalance  between  oxygen  delivery  and  oxygen  consumption.  Prolonged  oxygen deprivation leads to cellular hypoxia and derangement of critical biochemical processes at the cellular level, which can progress to the systemic level. 8.8.3.  Types of shock. 8.8.3.1.  Hypovolemic shock is a lack of oxygen to the tissues caused by  reduced blood volume. 8.8.3.1.1.  Hypovolemic  shock  may  result  from  hemorrhage-induced  blunt  or penetrating  trauma,  GI  bleeding,  hemorrhagic  pancreatitis,  fractures,  ruptured  aorta, abdominal or left ventricular free wall aneurysm. 8.8.3.1.2.  Also  caused  by  fluid  loss  induced  diarrhea,  vomiting,  heat  stroke, inadequate repletion of insensible losses, burns, and third spacing. 8.8.3.1.3.  Treatment of hypovolemic shock. 8.8.3.1.3.1.  Attempt  to  determine  cause  of  hypovolemia  (e.g.  hemorrhage, vomiting or diarrhea). 8.8.3.1.3.2.  Evaluate  for  decreased  peripheral  perfusion  as  indicated  by  delayed capillary refill and cool mottled extremities, dry skin, dry oral mucosa or postural hypotension. 8.8.3.1.3.3.  Unless  contraindicated,  an  initial  bolus  of  1-2  liters  of  warmed  (if possible)  Lactated  Ringers  (first  choice)  or  Normal  Saline  (second  choice) solution as rapidly as possible. Target is adequate tissue perfusion and improving signs/symptoms. Monitor fluid intake, BP, mental status and peripheral perfusion. 8.8.3.2.  Cardiogenic  shock  is  a  lack  of  oxygen  to  the  tissues  caused  by  cardiac  pump failure or pulmonary embolism. 8.8.3.2.1.  Specific conditions/events lead to cardiogenic shock including: myocardial infarction involving greater than 40 percent of the left ventricular myocardium, right ventricular  infarction,  dilated  cardiomyopathies,  stunned  myocardium  following prolonged  ischemia,  cardiopulmonary  bypass,  myocarditis  and  both  atrial  and ventricular arrhythmias. 90 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.8.3.2.2.  Atrial  fibrillation  and  flutter  reduce  cardiac  output.  Mechanical  causes  of cardiogenic shock include valvular defects, ventricular septal defects or rupture, atrial myxomas  and  a  ruptured  ventricular  free  aneurysm.  Other  cardiac  causes  of cardiogenic  shock  include  massive  pulmonary  embolism,  tension  pneumothorax, severe constrictive pericarditis and pericardial tamponade. 8.8.3.2.3.  Treatment of cardiogenic shock. 8.8.3.2.3.1.  Attempt  to  determine  the  cause  of  cardiogenic  shock:    Myocardial infarction,  myocardial  depression  due  to  advanced  septic  shock,  atrial  or   pulmonary  embolism,  tension ventricular  arrhythmia,  Brady  arrhythmia, pneumothorax,  constrictive  pericarditis,  pericardial tamponade  and  severe pulmonary hypertension. 8.8.3.2.3.2.  Perform  fluid  resuscitation  to  correct  hypovolemia  and  hypotension, unless pulmonary edema is present. 8.8.3.2.3.3.  Additional  drug  therapy  may  be  necessary  as  determined  by  a privileged provider. 8.8.3.3.  Distributive  (vasodilatory)  shock  is  a  lack  of  oxygen  to  the  tissues  caused  by hypotension  due  to  an  infection  or  anaphylactic  reaction.  Examples  include  neurogenic, septic and anaphylactic. 8.8.3.3.1.  May  result  from  systemic  inflammatory  response,  pancreatitis,  burns  or multiple  traumatic  injuries.  Also  from  toxic  shock  syndrome,  anaphylaxis  and anaphylactoid  reactions,  drug  or  toxin  reactions  including:  insect  bites,  transfusion reactions, and heavy metal poisoning.   Addisonian  crisis,  myxedema  coma, 8.8.3.3.2.  Other  contributing  factors: neurogenic  shock  after  spinal  cord  injury,  acute  systemic  inflammation  following acute  myocardial  infarction,  post-resuscitation  syndrome  and  post-cardiopulmonary bypass. 8.8.3.3.3.  Treatment for distributive shock. 8.8.3.3.3.1.  Evaluate  for  decreased  peripheral  perfusion  as  indicated  by  delayed capillary refill and cool mottled extremities, dry skin, dry oral mucosa or postural hypotension. 8.8.3.3.3.2.  At  least  1  or  2  liters  of  NS  or  lactated  ringers  are  initially  given  as rapidly as possible in an attempt to restore tissue perfusion. 8.8.3.3.3.3.  Continue  fluid  resuscitation  at  the  initial  rapid  rate  as  long  as  the systemic  BP  remains  low.  Monitor  fluid  intake/urine  output,  BP,  mental  status and peripheral perfusion. 8.8.3.3.3.4.  If  it  is  neurogenic  shock,  restore  volume.  Do  not  use  vasoactive medications  until  volume  is  restored.  Steroids  should  only  be  used  after consultation with a neurosurgeon. Keep the patient as normo-thermic as possible. 8.8.3.3.3.5.  If it is septic shock, treat the underlying infection. 8.8.3.3.3.5.1.  Antibiotics and fluid bolus IAW physician’s orders. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 91 8.8.3.3.3.6.  If  it  is  anaphylactic  shock,  initiate  resuscitation  and  follow  the  AE Clinical Protocol - Anaphylactic Reaction. 8.8.3.4.  Obstructive Shock. 8.8.3.4.1.  Obstructive  Shock  may  result  from  circulatory  compromise  due  to  direct failure  of  the  heart  muscle  or  compression  or  obstruction  of  blood  flow  through  the heart or great vessels. 8.8.3.4.2.  Contributing pulmonary embolism. factors: cardiac tamponade, tension  pneumothorax, 8.8.3.4.3.  Signs  and  symptoms  include  apprehension,  shortness  of  breath,  tracheal deviation, jugular vein distention. 8.8.3.4.4.  Treat the underlying pathology. 8.8.3.5.  The  different  types  of  shock  can  coexist.  As  an  example,  patients  with  septic shock    often  have  a  hypovolemic  component,  a  cardiogenic  component  (due  to  sepsis-related  dysfunction),  and  a  distributive  component  (due  to  the  effects  of  inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cascades on vascular permeability and vasodilatation). 8.8.4.  Clinical presentation of shock varies according to the type of shock, its cause, and its stage of presentation. 8.8.4.1.  Early signs of shock are characterized by rapid compensation for the diminished tissue perfusion. The early symptoms may include anxiety, restlessness, tachycardia, pale clammy skin, and either a modest increase or decrease in systemic BP. 8.8.4.2.  As  compensatory  mechanisms  become  overwhelmed,  additional  symptoms  for late  shock  may  include:  diaphoresis,  decreased  urine  output,  agitation,  lethargy, dizziness, hypotension, obtunded, and coma. 8.8.5.  Treatment/management and preflight/in-flight considerations for shock. 8.8.5.1.  Control  hemorrhage  and  maintain  circulation,  airway,  and  breathing.  Refer  to current AHA ACLS guidelines and notify C2. (T-2) 8.8.5.2.  Correct hypoxemia. Open airway with adjuncts if necessary. Maintain ventilator support  if  appropriate.  Provide  supplemental  oxygen  with  high  flow  delivery.  Refer  to AE Clinical Protocol –Emergency Oxygen. 8.8.5.3.  Place  the  patient  in  supine  position  to  assist  with  perfusion.  Keep  the  patient warm. 8.8.5.4.  Establish 2 large bore IV’s if not already in place. 8.8.5.5.  Monitor  BP  as  often  as  needed  but  at  a  minimum  hourly.  Urine  output  hourly with goal of 30-50 ml/hr. 8.8.6.  Documentation  will  include  subjective  and  objective  data  for  giving  the  medication; vital  signs,  if  indicated;  known  allergies;  for  women  of  childbearing  years:  date  of  last menstrual  cycle;  date  and  time  of  administration,  notification  of  a  physician,  and  the outcome.

Burn patients are frequently transported on AE missions and require intensive inflight nursing care. The  expert burn management  consultants  for worldwide AE are  at  the United States Army Institute for Surgical Research (USAISR). CONUS burn patients transferring to this facility are normally accompanied by a burn team from a civilian center. The burn team, only under special circumstances, accompanies burn patients from overseas. C2 and PMRC will coordinate the delivery of the burn team and their equipment to the originating facility and  subsequent  AE  airlift  of  the  patient  back  to  the  burn  center.  (T-2)  In  all  cases,  burn patients should be moved as soon as the USAISR and VFS concur it is appropriate. 8.9.2.  Stresses of flight affecting burn patients. 8.9.2.1.  Decreased partial pressure of oxygen:  Exacerbates oxygenation deficiencies due to  compromised  respiration  and/or  the  decreased  partial  pressure  of  oxygen  in  the presence of any inhalation injury. 8.9.2.2.  Barometric pressure changes:  Increases gastric distention and discomfort. 8.9.2.3.  Humidity:  Exacerbates fluid loss. 8.9.2.4.  Vibration:  May increase pain. 8.9.2.5.  Thermal:  Loss of natural insulation and skin integrity leaves the patient prone to hypothermia and pain. Severity of the burn affects the autonomic temperature regulatory functions and may increase oxygen demand. 8.9.2.6.  Fatigue:  Exacerbates the patient’s underlying condition. 8.9.3.  Intra-theater  triggers  to  activate  burn  flight  team.  Patients  with  significant  burns,  as defined by ABA criteria (http://www.ameriburn.org) as described in Attachment 10, will benefit from prompt consultation with a burn surgeon and transport to a burn center. 8.9.3.1.  Treating  physician  will  initiate  PM  process  and  contact  USAISR  Burn  Center designated  representative.  (T-2)  Governing  PMRC  will  assist  sending  physician  with appropriate (T-2)  Physician-to-physician communication  is  vital  in  developing  optimal  movement  plan  for  each  patient.

Burn patients who meet ABA burn center referral criteria shall be validated for movement  precedence in consultation  with  the TVFS, USAISR and referring privileged AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 93 provider.  (T-2)  If  TRAC2ES  is  not  available,  direct  contact  with  servicing  PMRC  is recommended  to  facilitate  PM.  (T-2)  The  USAISR  Burn  Center  will  provide  name  of accepting  burn  surgeon.  (T-2)  Delay  or  inability  to  contact  the  Burn  Center  directly should not delay processing of the PMR. 8.9.3.2.1.  Criteria  for  Significant  burns:    Full  thickness  (3rd  degree)  burns  of  any size,  partial  thickness  (2nd  degree)  involving  >10%  Total  Body  Surface  Area (TBSA), or Burns >20% total body surface area. Only partial and full thickness burns are used to calculate % TBSA. 8.9.3.2.2.  Burns involving >10% TBSA in children and adults over 50 years old. 8.9.3.2.3.  Significant burns to the hands, face, feet, ankles, perineum, genitals, across major joints or circumferential burns. 8.9.3.2.4.  Smoke inhalation injury. 8.9.3.2.5.  Burn patients with associated polytrauma. 8.9.3.2.6.  Burn patients requiring mechanical ventilation. 8.9.3.2.7.  Burn  injury  in  patients  with  preexisting  medical  disorders  which  could complicate management, prolong recovery, or affect mortality. 8.9.3.2.8.  Burn  patients  with  high  voltage  (>1000  V)  electrical  injury,  including lightning.  Fluid  rate  cannot  be  estimated  using  %  TBSA  because  much  of  the  high voltage  injury  is  hidden.  Consultation  with  a  burn  surgeon  at  the  USAISR  is recommended to guide initial resuscitation guidelines. 8.9.3.2.9.  Chemical burns. 8.9.3.2.10.  Burns that require critical care or resuscitation (e.g. needing ERCC team transport). 8.9.4.  Burns:  Preflight/inflight considerations. 8.9.4.1.  Airway:    Anticipate  possible  airway/trachea  edema.  If  clinically  indicated, secure airway early with the largest ET tube possible prior to transport. 8.9.4.1.1.  Signs and symptoms of inhalation injury. NOTE:  Inhalation injuries are at high risk for rapid airway obstruction. 8.9.4.1.1.1.  Nasal/mucosal  charring,  burns  and/or  soot  on  face,  in  mouth  and nose, carbonaceous sputum, and hoarseness. 8.9.4.1.1.2.  Carbon  monoxide  poisoning  symptoms  include  pink  to  cherry-red skin,  tachycardia,  tachypnea,  headache,  dizziness,  and  nausea;  central  nervous system (CNS) symptoms vary with carboxyhemoglobin level. WARNING:  Pulse oximetry reading is not accurate in carbon monoxide poisoning. 8.9.4.1.2.  Evaluate  individuals  involved  in  blasts  and/or  confined  in  a  burning environment  for  airway  compromise.  NOTE:    Onset  may  be  delayed  and  other injuries may not be apparent. 94 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.9.4.1.3.  Secure tubes with ties or suture rather than tape. Tape does not secure well on  burned  skin  and  increases  risk  of  ETT  dislodgement.  Important  to  reassess  ETT placement every hr. for the first 24-48 hrs. as edema forms and resolves. 8.9.4.1.4.  If  non-vented,  administer  high  flow  O2  via  humidifier  bottles  in-flight  to provide cool mist and maintain pulse oximetry greater than 92%. 8.9.4.1.5.  Patients with known or suspected inhalation injury may require specialized mechanical ventilation. 8.9.4.2.  Patients  with  burns  20%  TBSA  or  more,  excluding  first-degree  burns,  should have an IV, NG/OG tube, and foley catheter in place during all phases of AE. 8.9.5.  Burns:  Fluid loss and intravenous fluid resuscitation. 8.9.5.1.  IV access via 2 large bore (18 gauge or larger), if needed. Obtain central venous access if the patient will undergo fluid resuscitation prior to transport. (T-0) 8.9.5.2.  First 24 Hours: 8.9.5.2.1.  Intravenous  fluid  resuscitation  will  be  performed  for  patients  whose  burn size  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  20%  TBSA.  (T-0)  Lactated  Ringers  (LR)  is  the preferred fluid for resuscitation. The goal of initial fluid resuscitation is to restore and maintain adequate tissue perfusion and vital organ function, in addition to preserving heat-injured but viable tissue. Fluid needs are based on the size of the patient and the extent of the burn. 8.9.5.2.1.1.  The  ‘Rule  of  10s’  offers  a  simplified  method  of  estimating  initial fluid  rate  for  thermal  injuries  and  provides  values  generally  between  those calculated  by  the  Modified  Brooke  Formula  and  Parkland  formula.  The  Rule  of 10s is as follows:  Initiate fluid resuscitation using the Rule of 10s (10 mL/hr. x % TBSA) for patients with burns involving 20% TBSA or greater. The Rule of 10s is  applied  for  patients  weighing  between  40  and  80  kilograms  (kg).  For  patients weighing more than 80 kg, add 100 mL/hr. to LR rate for each 10 kg >80 kg. 8.9.5.2.1.2.  Clinical  indicators  for  adequacy  of  fluid  resuscitation  are:    Clear sensorium,  heart  rate  <  or  equal  to  120/minute  (min),  Mean  Arterial  Pressure (MAP) > or equal to 55 mmHg, strong peripheral pulses, serum and electrolytes within normal limits and the absence of metabolic acidosis. 8.9.5.3.  Urinary  output:    Determines  the  adequacy  of  renal  perfusion  and  fluid resuscitation. 8.9.5.3.1.  The  target  for  resuscitation  is  to  maintain  adequate  UOP  of  30-50ml/hr  . Titrate fluid up or down approximately 20% every hour to achieve this goal. NOTE:  The  fluid  rate  is  increased  by  20%  or  decreased  by  10%  every  hr.,  as  required,  in order to achieve an hourly urine output of 30-50 ml/hr. for an adult.   over  resuscitation  may  cause  more  harm  due 8.9.5.3.1.1.  NOTE  : to compartment syndrome than periods of under-resuscitation, thus UOP < 30 ml/hr should be tolerated if crystalloid infusion rates are high (>1L/hr) and adjuncts to crystalloid  infusion  are  unsuccessful  (e.g.  colloid  infusion  or  vasopressors  per physician). AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 95 8.9.5.3.2.  With  electrical  burns,  urine  may  be  rusty  red  in  color.  Maintain  output  at 30-50 mL/hr. to prevent buildup of myoglobin in the kidneys. If pigmenturia occurs, then maintain an output of 75-100 mL/hr 8.9.5.3.3.  In children less than 30 kg, hourly output is maintained at 1 to 2 ml/kg/hr. 8.9.6.  Burn dressings: 8.9.6.1.  Ensure  burns  are  dressed  with  clean,  dry,  non-constrictive,  bulky  dressings. Separate  fingers,  toes,  as  well  as  ears  from  touching  the  side  of  the  head.  Normally, dressings  are  not  changed  in-flight.  Reinforce  if  necessary.  Common  dressings  applied are: 8.9.6.1.1.  Silverlon  -  Used  on  partial  thickness  to  full  thickness  burns.  This  is  a synthetic  non-adherent  dressing  impregnated  with  Silver  that  is  applied  to  an  open wound  to  promote  healing.  This  is  moistened  with  sterile  water  prior  to  application and  must  remain  moist  to  activate  the  silver  properties.  (T-0)  Dressing  should  be moistened with sterile water every 6 hours and prn to keep moist. (T-0) 8.9.6.1.2.  Sulfamylon 5% Solution - Used on partial thickness to full thickness burns. It prevents infection from gram negative and gram positive bacteria and helps remove pseudo  eschar.  May  cause  burning  when  applied.  This  dressing  also  requires  wet downs with the Sulfamylon 5% Solution every 6 hrs. 8.9.6.1.3.  Bacitracin  -  Limited  antimicrobial  properties  but  easy  to  apply.  Used  for superficial burns. 8.9.6.2.  May see negative pressure wound dressings. 8.9.7.  Cardiac monitoring:  For patients with cardiac history, hypertension, electrical burns, and patients over 50 years of age. 8.9.8.  Circulation  checks:    All  extremities.  Monitor  peripheral  pulses  Q1hr  for  electrical, circumferential  burns  and  those  burns  >20%  TBSA.  May  require  Doppler  (difficult  to  hear on air craft) and may have escharotomy or fasciotomy. If the pulse is undetectable, call C2. (T-2) 8.9.9.  Mental  status:    Key  indicator  of  hypoxia  and  cardiovascular  stability.  Perform neurological assessments frequently. 8.9.10.  Temperature  control:    Extremely  prone  to  hypothermia.  Monitor  temperature  and maintain a high temperature in the cabin, if possible. The MCD will speak with the PIC and or  the  Loadmaster/Boom  Operator  whenever  patients  are  on  board  and  the  ambient temperature  exceeds  a  comfortable  level.  (T-0)  NOTE:    May  cover  patient  with  first  aid thermal blanket (i.e. space blanket), clean blankets or sleeping bags for temperature control. 8.9.11.  Positioning and exercise. 8.9.11.1.  Essential  to  promote  circulation  and  provide  comfort.    Prevents  contractures, pressure sores, thrombosis, and conversion of burns. 8.9.11.2.  Maintain the position of function (e.g. hands, joints, and feet). 8.9.11.2.1.  Elevate  upper  torso:    Assists  cerebral  venous  return,  slows  down  edema formation, and assists respiratory functions by reducing diaphragm crowding. 96 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.9.11.2.2.  Elevate  extremities:    Reduces  edema,  increases  venous  return,  and reduces pain. 8.9.11.3.  Consider pain medication prior to range of motion (ROM) exercise or changing positions. 8.9.11.4.  Perform ROM exercises according to provider’s orders. 8.9.12.  Narcotics/analgesics. 8.9.12.1.  Used  for  both  sedation  and  pain  relief.  Administered  as  ordered  by  the physician.  Do  not  give  supplemental  acetaminophen  (Tylenol)  with  oral  narcotics containing acetaminophen as this may lead to toxicity risks. 8.9.12.2.  Consider  using  continuous  IV  pain  medication  and  sedation  for  an  intubated patient during transport. 8.9.12.3.  Dilauded IV push will not be administered by flight nurses 8.9.13.  The  Burn  Flight  Team  may  internally  feed  critically  ill  patients  during  flight  if previous tube feedings were established. Patient may have an NG/OG tube inserted prior to flight for medication administration and possible gastric decompression. 8.9.14.  Eye drops/ointment/lacri-lube/antibiotics are frequently given to these patients.8.10.  Hematological and Endocrine Management. 8.10.  Not Used. 8.10.1.  Blood dyscrasia. Affects one or more of the blood components, the bone marrow or the  entire  blood  system.  It  can  be  acute  or  chronic,  acquired  or  congenital.  Seen  in chemotherapy, post-transplant, post-trauma, renal and liver disease. 8.10.2.  Stresses of flight affecting patients with hematological disorders. 8.10.2.1.  Decreased  partial  pressure  of  oxygen:    Exacerbates  the  body’s  decreased oxygen transport capability in the blood leading to hypoxia and cardiac decompensation. 8.10.2.2.  Thermal:  Hot and cold temperatures increase the body’s oxygen requirements. 8.10.2.3.  Decreased  humidity:    Dehydration  causes  headaches  and  decreases  blood volume. 8.10.2.4.  Fatigue:  Complicates the underlying pathology. 8.10.3.  Red  blood  cells  (RBCs):    The  efficiency  of  RBCs  depends  on  the  quantity  and quality of the hemoglobin it contains. Normal Hgb concentration is 14-16 grams (g)/deciliter (dL), and varies with the patient’s gender and age. 8.10.3.1.  Patients with Hgb below 8.0 mg may be transported if the condition is chronic and stable, and not related to bleeding. Patients with a hematocrit (HCT) below 25% are not  airlifted  without  concurrence  of  the  VFS.  Low  flow  O2  is  used  continuously  on patients with extremely low Hgb or HCT levels, as in dialysis and chemotherapy patients. A cabin  altitude restriction below 5,000 ft. may  be ordered by the VFS.  Refer  to  table 8.2. 8.10.3.2.  Types of anemia. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 97 8.10.3.2.1.  Hemolytic:    Destruction  of  erythrocytes  caused  by  bacteria,  parasites, venom, transfusions, chemicals, and genetics (thalassemia and sickle cell). Sickle cell crisis can occur at cabin altitudes as low as 4000 ft. 8.10.3.2.2.  Aplastic:    Failure  of  the  bone  marrow  to  produce  erythrocytes  due  to chemicals, medications and disease. 8.10.4.  White  blood  cells  (WBCs  or  leukocytes):    The  main  function  of  leukocytes  is  to isolate areas of inflammation or infection. 8.10.4.1.  Normal  adult  blood  contains  5,000  -  10,000  WBC’s  per  cubic  millimeter  of whole blood. 8.10.4.2.  Leukocyte  disorders  .  Caused  by  abnormal  WBCs  (too  few,  too  many  or abnormal morphology). 8.10.4.2.1.  Monitor  preflight  absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  and  en  route temperature.  ANC  below  1,000  is  considered  neutropenic  and  at  risk  for  infection; below  500  is  a  severe  risk  for  infection  and  for  flight.  Monitor  temperature  every  4 hrs.  Temperature  above  100.4  F  is  considered  significant;  above  101.0  F  requires communication with the VFS and AOC/AECT C2. 8.10.4.2.2.  Use  good  hand  washing,  protective  isolation  with  the  patient  wearing  a N95 mask. 8.10.4.2.3.  Dietary considerations: 8.10.4.2.3.1.  Avoid  all  fresh/uncooked  fruits,  nuts  and  vegetables,  including  all fresh  garnishes,  raw  or  rare-cooked  meat,  fish,  and  eggs.  All  eggs  should  be thoroughly  cooked.    Avoid  yogurt  and  yogurt  products  with  live  and  active cultures. 8.10.4.2.3.2.  All  canned,  bottled  and  powdered  beverages  and  sports  drinks  are OK. Brewed coffee and tea are acceptable. 8.10.5.  Platelets  (thrombocytes). 8.10.5.1.  Normal platelet count is greater than 150,000/cubic millimeter. 8.10.5.2.  Thrombocytopenia:    Observe  for  bruising,  uncontrolled  bleeding,  petechiae, hematuria, hematomas, and GI bleeding. 8.10.5.2.1.  Avoid aspirin and other platelet inhibiting medications. 8.10.5.2.2.  Position for safety and enforce fall precautions. 8.10.6.  Preflight/in-flight nursing care for blood dyscrasias. 8.10.6.1.

There is no glucose monitor or chem strips in the AE allowance standard. ERCC  team  may  be  able  to  assist  with  a  glucose  assessment  in  an  emergency situation  using  approved  equipment.  Although  glucose  monitors  are  not  included  in the  AE  allowance  standard,  use  of  a  glucose  monitor  approved  for  in-flight  use  is authorized. 8.10.7.2.7.  MTFs  at  RON  destinations  will  provide  patient  education  and  approved AE glucose monitors. (T-2). MTF will test approved glucose monitors prior to flight to ensure operation.   (T-2) 8.10.7.2.8.  Blood  glucose  should  be  checked  prior  to  departure  and/or  at  en  route stops.  If  glucose  monitoring  may  be  required  ensure  an  approved  glucose  monitor accompanies the patient in-flight. AECMs should be prepared to assist patients and/or attendants in performing blood glucose. 8.10.7.2.9.  If  a  patient  presents  with  objective  and/or  subjective  signs  of hyperglycemia  or  hypoglycemia,  assist  the  patient  with  obtaining  a  blood  glucose reading, contact the PMRC, and take additional action as required. 8.10.7.3.  Hyperglycemia.  Hyperglycemia  is  defined  as  an  abnormally  high  blood glucose  level.  Early  symptoms  of  hyperglycemia  include:  Polydipsia,  polyuria,  fatigue, blurred vision, headache and dry warm flushed skin. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 99 8.10.7.3.1.

Treatment/management. directed by a privileged provider. Insulin,  fluids,  electrolyte  replacement  as 8.10.7.4.  Hypoglycemia  . Hypoglycemia is  defined as a sub-therapeutic plasma glucose concentration  exposing  an  individual  to  harm.  The  American  Diabetes  Association  and the  Endocrine  Society  Workgroup  on  Hypoglycemia  published  a  clinical  classification system  for  hypoglycemia  in  patients  with  diabetes  mellitus.  This  classification  system includes  documented  symptomatic  hypoglycemic  events  and  severe  hypoglycemic events.  The  low-normal  cut-off  value  for  a  diabetic’s  self-monitored  blood  glucose (SMBG) level has been debated; with the low normal value ranging from <63 mg/dl to < 70mg/dl. However, a known diabetic with a SMBG level of <70 should alert the clinician to look for further signs and symptoms associated with hypoglycemia. 8.10.7.4.1.  The sending facility will provide known diabetic patients with a supply of simple  and  complex  carbohydrates  as  these  food  items  may  not  be  available  on  the aircraft. (T-3) 8.10.7.4.2.  Symptomatic mild hypoglycemia signs and symptoms. 8.10.7.4.2.1.  Plasma glucose concentration of <70 mg/dl (if available). 8.10.7.4.2.2.  Early  signs  and  symptoms  include  diaphoresis,  tremors,  pallor, tachycardia, palpitations, nervousness. Previous patient history is also valuable. 8.10.7.4.2.3.  Later  signs  and  symptoms  include  light-headedness,  headache, irritability, slurred speech and weakness. 8.10.7.4.3.  Severe hypoglycemia signs and symptoms. 8.10.7.4.3.1.  Classified  as  a  severe  event  if  it  required  the  assistance  of  another person to initiate resuscitative actions for the diabetic patient. 8.10.7.4.3.2.  Severe hypoglycemia can potentially be life-threatening and caused by  an  overdose  of  insulin,  a  reduction  in  diet  or  increased  exercise  without sufficient caloric intake. 8.10.7.4.3.3.  Signs  and  symptoms  include:    aggressive  or  unusual  behavior, normal  or  rapid  respirations,  tachycardia,  paleness,  diaphoresis,  headache, dizziness, fainting, disorientation, confusion, seizure, loss of gag reflex, and loss of consciousness. 8.10.7.4.3.4.  If any signs or symptoms are present, immediately rule out hypoxia. Concurrently obtain VS, pulse oximetry, ascertain last meal and check a glucose level if possible. 8.10.7.4.3.5.  For  all  known  or  suspected  hypoglycemic  events  notify  the validating flight surgeon and AOC/AECT for guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation. 100 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.10.7.4.4.

Patients  en  route  to  the  hyperbaric  (decompression)  chamber  may  also  include  the following  diagnoses:  carbon  monoxide  poisoning,  gas  gangrene,  or  extensive  wound infections. 8.12.  Neurological Management. 8.12.1.  Stresses of flight affecting neurological patients. 8.12.1.1.  Decreased partial pressure of oxygen:  Lower levels of O2 causes brain cell and tissue  ischemia.  Brain  cell  ischemia  produces  cerebral  edema  which  leads  to  increased ICP,  then  hypoventilation  and  further  hypoxemia.  NOTE:    One  hypoxic  episode  in  the presence of traumatic brain injury may lead to a catastrophic secondary brain injury. 8.12.1.2.  Barometric  pressure  changes:    Penetrating  head  injuries,  skull  fractures  and severe  facial  fractures  may  produce  air  in  the  cranium,  causing  increased  ICP.  The potential  for  ear  block  exists  in  those  patients  who  have  a  decreased  level  of consciousness,  inability  to  follow  directions  or  a  physical  disability.  Valsalva  increases ICP.  NOTE:    A  cabin  altitude  restriction  minimizes  the  stresses  of  barometric  pressure changes and decreased partial pressure of oxygen. 8.12.1.3.  Vibration:  May cause motion sickness and vomiting, thus increasing ICP. 8.12.1.4.  Thermal  Changes: involvement.   A  consideration  for  patients  with  hypothalamus 8.12.1.5.  Decreased  humidity:    Will  dry  the  corneas  of  patients  with  decreased corneal/blink reflex, and possibly increase dehydration and headaches. 8.12.1.6.  G-Forces:    Takeoff  may  increase  ICP  and  bleeding  for  litter  patients  or decrease  cerebral  blood  flow  to  ambulatory  patients.

Deliver high flow O2 and rule out hypoxia and hypoglycemia Maintain patent airway, adequate breathing and circulation, and a pulse oximeter reading > 92%.  If ordered, implement hyperventilation if patient’s pupil/pupils are dilated and nonreactive.  WARNING:  Excessive hyperventilation/ hyper oxygenation to control increased ICP without ICP monitoring may have adverse results. Keep assisted breathing rate < 20/min. If situation occurs in-flight, consider lower cabin altitude if operationally feasible. Notify C2 for guidance and possible diversion to a definitive care MTF (if required). (T-2) .  If ordered, initiation of hypertonic saline (3%), normal saline not greater than 100ml/hr. (if not hypovolemic). May receive mannitol as ordered. Document I&O If patient is in a drug-induced coma, the patient will be a ERCC patient and on a ventilator. (T-0) 8.12.4.  Intracranial pressure. 8.12.4.1.  Signs and symptoms increased ICP. 8.12.4.1.1.  LOC is the most important indicator of brain function. 8.12.4.1.2.  Elevated  BP  with  a  widening  pulse  pressure  (the  difference  between systolic and diastolic). 8.12.4.1.3.  Change in pupil size. 8.12.4.1.4.  Tachycardia initially, followed by bradycardia as ICP increases. 8.12.4.1.5.  Tachypnea (early) and then slowing with lengthening period of apnea. 8.12.4.1.6.  Headache:  Increasing intensity and may be aggravated with movement. 8.12.4.1.7.  Vomiting, with or without nausea, may become projectile. 8.12.4.2.  When ICP increases, the body attempts to perfuse the compressed brain tissue at  all  cost.  Hypotension  in  head  injured  patients  can  be  catastrophic  because  cerebral blood  vessels  cannot  auto-regulate  and  therefore  cannot  constrict  to  preserve  cerebral blood  flow  during  hypotension.  When  auto-regulation  is  lost,  massive  cerebral vasodilation  occurs,  and  secondarily  increases  ICP.  To  monitor  ICP  the  patient  would need an arterial line and ICP monitor. See Table 8.6. for assessment parameters. 104 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 Table 8.6.  ICP and Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) Parameters.

See Attachment 11. 8.12.6.2.  Casualties  displaying  any  of  the  signs/symptoms  in  Table  8.7.  MACE  -  Red Flags  should  be  referred  for  additional  medical  evaluation  as  soon  as  operationally possible.  If  new  symptoms  occur  before  takeoff,  the  patient  is  not  stable  for  flight,  and needs to be cleared by a FS. Notify Theater PMRC, as soon as possible. Table 8.7.  MACE - Red Flags.

Seizures/Status  epilepticus.    This  is  a  serious  neurologic  emergency.  Status epilepticus  has  high  morbidity  and  mortality  (permanent  brain  damage/severe  neurologic deficits).  It  is  characterized  by  acute,  prolonged,  repetitive  seizure  activity  or  series  of generalized  seizures  without  return  to  consciousness  between  attacks.  Factors  precipitating status  epilepticus  in  patients  with  pre-existing  seizure  disorder  include  medication withdrawal,  fever,  metabolic  or  environmental  stresses,  alcohol  or  drug  withdrawal,  and sleep  deprivation.  The  stresses  of  flight  should  also  be  considered  a  potential  precipitating factor. 8.12.9.1.  Signs and symptoms. 8.12.9.1.1.  Staring and subtle body movement. 8.12.9.1.2.  Brief loss of awareness. 8.12.9.1.3.  Stiffening of muscles especially the back, arms and legs. 8.12.9.1.4.  Rhythmic,  jerking  muscle  movements,  usually  affecting  the  neck,  face and arms or sudden brief jerks or twitches of the arms and legs. 8.12.9.1.5.  Loss of muscle control, which may cause a sudden collapse or fall to the ground 8.12.9.1.6.  Loss  of  consciousness,  body  stiffening  and  shaking,  and  sometimes  loss of bladder control or biting the tongue. 8.12.9.1.7.  Classic signs. 8.12.9.1.7.1.  The seizure lasts more than five minutes. 8.12.9.1.7.2.  Breathing or consciousness does not return after the seizure stops. 8.12.9.1.7.3.  A second seizure follows immediately. 8.12.9.1.7.4.

Decreased partial pressure of oxygen:  Exacerbates the effects of hemorrhage, shock and low H&H. 8.13.1.2.  Barometric  pressure  changes:    May  contribute  to  compartment  syndrome  if patient is in a circumferential cast or resultant condition causes extremity hypo-perfusion. 8.13.1.3.  Vibration:    Severe  jarring  may  affect  alignment  and/or  positioning  of unstabilized fractures. Vibration alone can increase pain at fracture sites. 8.13.1.4.  Humidity:  May lead to dehydration predisposing individuals to VTEs and may also cause skin dryness over time, leading to itching under cast. 8.13.1.5.  Thermal:    Changes  of  temperature  may  compromise  circulation  and  increase pain;  patient  can  sweat  under  cast/dressings  on  the  flight  line  and  then  become  cold  at altitude. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 109 8.13.2.  Preflight/in-flight considerations. 8.13.2.1.  Neurovascular  assessment:    Compare  to  unaffected  extremity.  Important  to obtain a baseline assessment prior to flight to recognize changes during flight. 8.13.2.1.1.  Sensation:    Compare  to  peripheral  nerve  block  side  to  unaffected  side.  Assess level of epidural effectiveness, utilizing the dermatome map in Figure 8.1. 8.13.2.2.  Peripheral pulse qualities (proximal/distal to injury). Presence does not rule out injury; re-assess frequently and compare to unaffected extremity. 8.13.2.3.  Capillary  refill  less  than  2  seconds  is  normal.  Can  be  hard  to  assess  in dark/shadows,  affected  by  extremity  temperature,  staining  of  extremity  with  blood/prep solutions. 8.13.2.4.  Presence  of  edema.  Remove  constricting  items  above  and  below  the  injury (rings and watches, tight clothing, tight dressings/splints; casts should be bivalved). 8.13.2.5.  Color  and  temperature.  Affected  by  ambient  temperature,  therapeutic  cooling, PNB/epidural catheter. 8.13.2.6.  Motor function. Affected by PNB/epidural catheter. 8.13.2.7.  Reassess after position change and immobilization. 8.13.2.8.  Instruct  the  patient  to  report  any  pain  and  motor  sensory  changes  (tingling, numbness, weakness, increasing pain). 8.13.2.9.  External  fixators:    pin  care  as  necessary  will  be  completed  during  preflight. Fixators  may  be  handled/manipulated  by  medical  care  personnel (nursing care/transportation/wound  care)  and  used  to  transmit  traction  to  affected  limb  in  select situations (skeletal traction). Fixators may also be suspended from fixed devices in select situations (preparation for surgery or edema control). 8.13.3.  Considerations for orthopedic and soft tissue injuries. 8.13.3.1.  Ensure skin integrity remains intact. 8.13.3.2.  Maintain  injured  extremity/fracture  immobility  to  control  bleeding,  maintain circulation, and to prevent fat embolism. 8.13.3.3.  Maintain traction if applicable. WARNING:  Do not use free hanging weights in-flight.  WARNING:    Sitting  in  cramped  conditions  for  a  long  period  of  time,  and/or injury and infection may lead to a VTE or a blood clot deep in the tissues of the calves or groin.    Consider  thrombosis  prophylaxis  in  select  cases  (should  be  part  of  preflight assessment). 8.13.3.3.1.  Ensure stability when using the following equipment: 8.13.3.3.2.  Stryker frame. 8.13.3.3.3.  HALO/external fixation/skeletal traction. 8.13.3.3.4.  C-Collar, backboard, vacuum spine board or other non-shifting medium. 8.13.3.3.5.  Hare, Sager, Kendrick traction devices and Thomas splints. 110 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.13.4.  Compartment syndrome  :  The compromise of muscle viability due to swelling of, or bleeding into tissues encased within the fascial sheath of an extremity. Resultant pressure change  in  the  extremity  blocks  venous  outflow  and  subsequent  “backup”  of  blood  flow, ultimately  preventing  arterial  inflow.  Associated  with  open/closed  fractures,  external fixation/skeletal  devices,  compression/crushing  injuries  or  constrictive  bandages/casts, vascular injuries, burns. Can occur in upper and lower extremity injuries. WARNING:  This is a limb-threatening emergency. 8.13.4.1.  Assess for signs and symptoms:  Classic signs of edema, pulselessness, pallor, paresthesia  or  sensory  deficit  with  late  signs  of  paralysis  and  cyanosis.  Severe unremitting  pain,  pain  on  passive  stretch  of  muscle  or  pain  that  is  out  of  proportion  to what  is  expected  by  the  provider  and  compartment  firmness  are  earliest  signs. Compartment  pressure  measurement  with  invasive  needle  device  is  not  required  for diagnosis, but can be used by physicians in obtunded/sedated patients. 8.13.4.2.  Treatment and Management. 8.13.4.2.1.  Remove  constrictive  dressings.  Ensure  cast  is  bi-valved  prior  to  leaving the MTF if cast is less then 48 hours old. Refer to  8.5.2. 8.13.4.2.2.  Maintain extremity at heart level. Neither elevation nor dependency of the extremity has been shown to benefit. 8.13.4.2.3.  Administer  pain  medication  after  assessment.  WARNING:    Frequently assess  adequacy  of  pain  control  measures.  Pain  medicine  is  often  inadequate  to control  the  symptoms  of  CS,  and  even  when  successful,  could  potentially  hide  the emergent  nature  of  the  problem.  This  is  a  surgical  emergency.  The  measures  listed here  are  of  potential  benefit  in  an  impending  compartment  syndrome,  but  once established these patients need fasciotomy. Call C2; the airlift agency will contact the governing PMRC to consider diversion to a location where surgical care is available. (T-2)   8.13.5.  Amputation  :  Control bleeding and pain. Assess dressings. Amputation stumps are prone  to  swelling,  causing  initially  adequate  dressings  to  become  compressive.  If  the  limb has  been  fitted  with  a  prosthesis,  the  socket  or  sleeve  may  become  too  tight  or  loose  and require removal. 8.13.6.  Pelvic  fractures  :    Complete  bed  rest.  May  have  external  fixation  devices.  Assess VS and assess distal pulses regularly. Extensive blood loss and internal vascular injuries are associated with pelvic fractures. PE/VTE prophylaxis is essential. Section 8.6. 8.13.7.  Application of splints/ace wraps/kerlix: 8.13.7.1.  Proper splint placement:  Splint the joint above and the joint below the injury (Do  not  splint  the  shoulder  when  splinting  an  elbow  and  do  not  splint  the  hip  when splinting the knee). 8.13.7.2.  Proper  alignment:    In  the  position  of  function/comfort  as  long  as  distal perfusion and neurological exam unchanged. 8.13.7.3.  Security of splint/ace. Re-wrap if too tight or too loose. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 111 8.13.7.4.  Air splints:  WARNING:  Air expands at altitude. Requires close observation and adjustments during ascent, at altitude and descent, and should not be used in-flight if alternate splinting devices are available. 8.13.7.5.  Positioning and alignment. 8.13.7.5.1.  Reposition every 2 hrs. with pillows. 8.13.7.5.2.  Pad and  elevate extremities. WARNING:   Do not  tie extremities to  any portion of the aircraft in order to maintain elevation. 8.13.7.6.  ROM exercises. 8.13.7.7.  Avoid resting extremities on the bulkhead or the interior of the aircraft due to effects of vibration. 8.13.7.8.  Litter patients should be positioned away from the bulkhead. 8.13.7.9.  Spica  casts  require  two  litter  spaces  (these  are  now  rare,  usually  confined  to pediatric patients, special attention to toileting needs is required). 8.13.7.10.  Mobility impaired ambulatory patients should not be near emergency exits. 8.14.  Wound management. 8.14.1.  Provider’s orders for all wound management include frequency of dressing changes and  type  of  wound  care,  including  surgical  debridement,  while  in  the  patient  movement system. 8.14.2.  All combat wounds are considered contaminated and will not be closed initially. 8.14.3.  Note type and amount of drainage on dressings. On the aircraft, dressings will not be changed; reinforce only. 8.14.4.  Any wound associated with a fracture must be managed as if it was an open fracture and  treatment  should  be  started  within  8  hrs.  (T-0)This  includes  debridement,  when appropriate, and IV antibiotics prior to and during flight. 8.14.5.  Observe for increased temperature, redness at wound site, swelling, and presence of drains (note amount, color and location). 8.14.6.  Control  bleeding  with  direct  pressure,  elevation,  and  pressure  points.  If  that  is  not effective, a tourniquet or Quick Clot may be used if available. NOTE: The Aircraft First Aid Kit contains an Israeli Tourniquet and Quick Clot.  Monitor BP closely in actively bleeding patients. Immediately contact C2. (T-2)   8.14.7.  Pain  medication,  as  ordered,  after  assessment.  Frequently  assess  adequacy  of  pain control measures. Avoid over-sedation and nausea, especially in supine patients. 8.14.8.  Wound drainage tubes (Jackson-Pratt [JP], T-tube, Hemovac etc.). 8.14.8.1.  Assess insertion site and assure suction is maintained at altitude, if indicated. 8.14.8.2.  Document I&O. 8.14.8.3.  Use standard precautions for disposal of blood and body fluids. 8.14.9.  Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT)  . 112 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.14.9.1.  NPWT systems are generally indicated for the management of wounds, burns, ulcers, flaps and grafts. NPWT applies negative pressure to the wound in order to remove fluids,  including  wound  exudates,  irrigation  fluids,  and  infectious  materials.  Benefits  of NPWT  include  augmented  wound  granulation,  wound  contraction,  improved  control  of wound  exudates,  decreased  wound  edema,  reduced  skin  maceration,  and  improved  pain management. 8.14.9.2.  NPWT  are  contraindicated  in  the  presence  of  exposed  anastomotic  sites, exposed vasculature, exposed nerves, exposed organs, necrotic tissue with eschar present, untreated  osteomyelitis,  non-enteric  and  unexplored  fistulas,  and  malignancy  in  the wound.  Also,  carefully  consider  the  use  of  this  therapy  in  patients  with  certain  risk factors, including those with a high risk for bleeding and hemorrhage, and those receiving anticoagulants or platelet aggregation inhibitors. 8.14.9.3.  Do not continue with the flight if problems occur on the ground preflight. 8.14.9.4.  Assess patient comfort and system functioning every 2 hrs. in-flight. 8.14.9.4.1.  Be  vigilant  for  potentially  rare  life-threatening  bleeding  complications, and be prepared to take prompt action if that occurs. 8.14.9.4.2.  NPWT  should  not  be  interrupted  for  greater  than  2  hrs.  within  a  24  hr. period due to the potential for infection. 8.14.9.4.3.  Assess  proper  function  by  examining  for  alarms  on  the  pump  unit  and inspecting the dressing. The dressing for a properly functioning system should have a “raisin-skin” appearance. 8.14.9.4.4.  WARNING  .  The NPWT may cease effective pressure if the occlusive dressing is not sealed. Occlusive reinforcement may need to be applied. 8.14.9.4.5.  For  non-correctable  NPWT  system  failures  in-flight,  the  overlying occlusive film should be opened by making 2-3 slits into the film to allow for wound drainage. DO NOT remove the occlusive film or the sponge inside the wound for risk of bleeding or wound contamination. A dry dressing should then be applied over the site and reinforced as needed. Report wound vacuum system failure and actions taken to  receiving  facility  during  hand-off  for  follow-on  care.  Complete  a  DD  Form  2852 and  notify  C2  at  end  of  mission.  (T-2)    WARNING:    Do  not  interchange  different types of NPWT devices and dressings. Other suction units may not provide adequate and consistent suction thereby increasing risk of infection. 8.14.9.4.6.  Extra  NPWT  canisters  should  be  available  in  the  event  that  the  current ones  become  full  or  cracked.  NOTE:    This  guidance  is  for  use  in-flight  should  full system  failure  occur.  If  NPWT  system  failure  occurs  while  on  the  ground,  at originating station, or during en route stops contact the appropriate TPMRC. 8.14.9.5.  Document amount of drainage from the NPWT canisters. 8.15.  Medical Devices. 8.15.1.  Special  considerations  must  be  made  to  ensure  extremities  and  devices  are  not impeding egress of the aisles and exits. (T-3) AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 113 8.15.2.  Casts.  Ideally,  casts  on  recent  fractures  should  be  at  least  48  hrs.  old  to  allow  for possible soft tissue expansion inside the cast.  Casts should be bivalved if tissue edema and vascular compromise is possible, or if cast restricts emergency egress. Cast cutters will not be available in-flight. If casts are not to be bi-valved, such as on casted old injuries or because it jeopardizes  alignment  of  the  fracture,  specific  orders  “Do  not  BiValve  for  flight”  must  be written on proper documentation. (T-2) 8.15.2.1.  If the cast is over a surgical wound site, “window” the cast to allow for tissue expansion. Always keep the window replaced in the cast after assessment to prevent focal edema through the window. 8.15.2.2.  Assess  cast  for:    Proper  drying,  cracks,  rough  edges,  drainage  and  bleeding (outline, date and time site), foul odor, and pressure points. 8.15.2.3.  Perform  circulation  and  neurovascular  checks  prior  to  flight.  If  abnormal, contact the MTF to bivalve the cast or loosen the bivalved cast. Cast padding can be cut on  both  sides  with  scissors  to  further  reduce  compression  if  necessary  without compromising immobilization. 8.15.2.4.  Patients with crutches or full leg casts, or whose condition prevents them from using seats,  will be classified and transported as  litter patients.  (T-2) The MCD is  final authority on whether patients should be enplaned via litter. NOTE:  Crutches and canes must accompany patients who require such items. (T-2) 8.15.3.

Stresses of flight. 8.16.1.1.1.  Decreased  Partial  Pressure  of  Oxygen:    May  cause  increased  intraocular pressure  and  vasodilatation  due  to  hypoxia  and  may  aggravate  retinal  hemorrhage, detached retina and glaucoma. 8.16.1.1.2.  Barometric  pressure  changes:    Causes  increased  pressure  with  pain  and reduced blood flow to the eye. Post-op eye surgery patients may have trapped  air in the  globe;  certain  gases  used  in  surgery  may  persist  three  to  nine  weeks.  A  closed penetrating  eye  injury  may  also  have  trapped  air  in  the  globe;  air  normally  is reabsorbed  in  three  days.  Expanding  air  at  altitude  may  lead  to  increased  pressure, pain and/or extrusion of eye contents. 8.16.1.1.3.  Decreased  humidity:    Excessive  drying  of  the  eyes  leads  to  corneal irritation  and  abrasions  of  the  sclera,  especially  in  comatose  patients  or  patients whose eyes do not completely close. 8.16.1.1.4.  Vibration/thermal/turbulence:    Leads  to  motion  sickness,  vomiting,  and increased intraocular pressure and pain. 8.16.1.2.  Preflight/in-flight considerations. 8.16.1.2.1.

Do not  place  a head wrap over an unshielded eye. 8.16.1.2.2.2.  Shield  with  a  rigid  eye  shield  or  an  alternative  such  as  a  cup,  the casualty’s eye armor or other expedient device that does not place pressure on the globe. 8.16.1.2.2.3.  Do not attempt to open the eye. Do not remove foreign bodies. Do not use topical anesthetics. Shield and transport 8.16.1.2.3.  Suspect  air  in  the  globe  with  recent  surgery  and  penetrating  eye  injuries (may also have associated facial trauma/burns and head and C-Spine injuries). 116 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.16.1.2.4.  Post-op eye surgery patients will be cleared by an Ophthalmologist prior to flight. (T-2)  NOTE:  Any O2 requirements needed during flight will be ordered by the Ophthalmologist, or the VFS, if the Ophthalmologist is not available. (T-2) 8.16.1.2.5.  Successful outcomes for penetrating  eye injuries  with  documented air in the  globe  are  highly  dependent  on  rapid  transportation  to  specialized  care.  Maintain the  cabin  altitude  restriction  which  may  be  ordered  by  the  VFS.  NOTE:    Flying  at lower  altitudes  may  decrease  speed  and  increase  fuel  consumption;  however,  rapid transportation to definitive care takes precedence. 8.16.1.2.6.  Hyphema  or  blood  in  the  anterior  chamber  may  re-bleed  2-7  days  post-injury. Re-bleeding may cause pain and substantial visual disability or blindness. 8.16.1.2.7.  Medication:    Will  be  ordered  on  the  appropriate  patient  treatment  form and provided by the originating MTF. (T-2) Prescribed eye drops may affect vision. 8.16.1.2.8.  Patients with suspected bacterial or viral eye infections will not have eye patches.  (T-0) 8.16.1.2.9.  Patients  with  a  severe  detached  retina  or  penetrating  injury  must  have  a physician’s  order  for  complete  bed-rest  on  a  litter  with  the  head  immobilized, bilateral  eye  patches,  and  O2  in-flight.  (T-0)  NOTE:    Signs  and  symptoms  of detached  retina:    Light  flashes,  floating  black  spots,  curtain-like  narrowing  of peripheral vision. 8.16.1.2.10.  If vision worsens or pain and drowsiness develops en route: 8.16.1.2.10.1.  Assess  oxygenation.  Administer  high  flow  O2  and  call  C2  for further instructions. (T-2) 8.16.1.2.10.2.

Stresses of flight. 8.16.2.1.1.  Barometric  pressure  changes:    Gas  expansion  or  contraction  affects  the middle  ear  when  pressure  in  the  air-filled  cavities  does  not  equalize  with  the  cabin pressure. Equalization depends on the patency of the eustachian tube. During ascent, pressure  is  normally  passively  vented.  During  descent,  the  eustachian  tube  needs active “opening” as the pressure becomes negative. 8.16.2.1.2.  Noise:  Exposure for even a short period of time can lead to tinnitus, mild to severe pain, fatigue, and temporary to permanent hearing loss. Position away from high noise areas of aircraft and provide ear protection. 8.16.2.2.  Preflight/in-flight considerations. 8.16.2.2.1.  Ear  block.  Potential  patients  at  risk  are:    Upper  respiratory  infections (URI),  sinus  infections,  allergies,  otitis  media,  on  high-flow  O2,  facial  injury,  nasal packing, infants,  post-ears-nose-throat  (ENT)  surgery,  difficulty  swallowing, language barriers, unconscious/comatose patients. 8.16.2.2.1.1.  Prevention  techniques.  The  following  may  help  prevent  ear  blocks on descent:  Swallowing, yawning, moving jaw from side to side, chewing gum, Toynbee maneuver (swallowing water with the nostrils closed), valsalva (turning head away from the blocked ear while stretching the opposite ear to the shoulder which  stretches  the  Eustachian  tube  of  the  blocked  ear).  While  in  this  position, have the patient valsalva.   WARNING:  With certain diagnoses (e.g. glaucoma, recent  eye  surgery  or  injury,  nasal/facial  fractures,  post-operative  nasal  surgery, history of aneurysm, acute head injuries, severe hypertension, cardiac disease and arrhythmias, and neurological disease with ICP) valsalva is contra-indicated. 8.16.2.2.2.

Protect access site from cold, pressure, venipuncture, disconnection, and infection. 8.17.8.4.2.3.  Have  clamps  available  for  external  shunts  to  control  bleeding  if disconnected. 8.18.  OB/In-Flight Child Birth Management  . 8.18.1.  Stresses of flight. 8.18.1.1.  Decreased  partial  pressure  of  oxygen:    May  cause  an  increase  in  cardiac workload with a decrease in diaphragmatic excursion. Lower concentration of O2 to the placenta results in fetal hypoxia. 8.18.1.2.  Barometric  pressure  changes:    Gas  expansion  may  cause  pain  and  uterine irritability  and  decrease  capacity  for  lung  expansion.  Decreased  barometric  pressure  is also associated with onset of labor and premature rupture of membranes. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 127 8.18.1.3.  Noise/vibration:    May  increase  seizure  risk  in  pre-eclamptic  and  eclamptic patients,  and  may  cause  uterine  irritability  and  excessive  stimulation  and  movement  of the fetus. 8.18.1.4.  Decreased  humidity:    Dehydration  may  induce  or  complicate  preterm  labor. Pregnant women are also especially prone to dehydration and its effects. 8.18.1.5.  Fatigue:    Excess  weight,  physiological  changes,  overall  effects  of  the previously  mentioned  stresses,  and  the  length  of  time  in  the  AE  system  fatigues  the patient. 8.18.1.6.  G-Forces:    May  result  in  pushing  fetus  onto  the  maternal  vena  cava  or  the placenta. 8.18.2.  General considerations. 8.18.2.1.  Patients who are beyond the 34th week of pregnancy are not routinely accepted for AE, but will be moved if determined necessary by a physician. 8.18.2.2.  Patients in premature labor, or with prematurely ruptured membranes, may be airlifted after labor is assessed on a case-by-case basis. 8.18.2.3.  Patient  positioning:    If  on  strict  bed  rest,  patient  will  be  positioned  in  the  left lateral  recumbent  position.  (T-0)  If  the  patient  must  be  placed  in  the  supine  position, place a pillow under either hip  to  promote uterine displacement and relieve pressure on the superior vena cava, which can lead to hypotension and decreased oxygen flow to the fetus.  If  ambulatory,  seatbelt  should  be  placed  low  on  the  abdomen  across  the  hips  and may  be  padded  with  a  blanket  or  pillow.  A  litter  should  be  available  if  needed  for ambulatory pregnant patients or a back rest may be used. 8.18.2.4.  Pregnant  patients  are  at  increased  risk  of  VTE.  Hydration  should  be  stressed and  seated  patients  should  be  encouraged  to  ambulate  and  litter  patients  should  be encouraged to perform ROM exercises. 8.18.2.5.  Supplies and equipment. 8.18.2.5.1.  Universal OB pack. 8.18.2.5.2.  Airborne  life  support  system  (ALSS)  if  greater  than  34  weeks  or otherwise indicated. 8.18.2.5.3.

Other  significant  medical  history:    Epigastric  pain,  cardiac  history,  headache, infectious  disease  status,  medical  conditions  such  as  diabetes  and  hypertension.  History of smoking, alcohol, or drug use in pregnancy. 8.18.4.  Treatment/management priorities and in-flight considerations. 8.18.4.1.  If  gestation  is  greater  than  20  weeks,  FHTs  should  be  obtained  before departure, at cruise altitude and every 12 hours thereafter. If rupture of membranes occur, FHTs  should  be  obtained  immediately  (ambient  noise  may  make  it  impossible  to  hear FHTs). Normal range for FHTs are 120-160/minute. 8.18.4.2.  Obtain  maternal  VS  at  cruise  altitude  and  if  indicated  by  a  status  change. Maternal oxygenation is particularly important to ensure fetal well-being. 8.18.4.3.  Patient  comfort  may  be  the  greatest  concern  in  stable  pregnancies.  Comfort items,  hydration/snacks,  ambulation,  and  position  change  should  be  offered  as appropriate. 8.18.5.  Considerations  for  high-risk  OB:    A  qualified  medical  attendant  will  accompany high-risk OB patients. (T-2) 8.18.5.1.  Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. 8.18.5.1.1.  Chronic  hypertension:    Preexisting  hypertension  may  affect  maternal health, fetal growth, oxygenation, placental function, and predispose patient to other pregnancy complications. 8.18.5.1.2.  Gestational  hypertension:    Hypertension  diagnosed  before  20  weeks  of pregnancy  not  accompanied  by  other  symptoms.  May  affect  maternal  health,  fetal growth,  oxygenation,  placental  function,  and  predispose  patient  to  other  pregnancy complications. 8.18.5.1.3.  Preeclampsia:   Condition  generally  diagnosed  after  20  weeks  of pregnancy. Multi-organ system disease usually evidenced by elevated BP (>140/90), proteinuria,  epigastric  pain,  visual  changes,  headaches,  and  abnormal  liver  function tests.  HELLP  Syndrome:    Variant  of  preeclampsia  characterized  by  hemolysis, AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 129 elevated  liver  enzymes,  and  low  platelets.  The  only  resolution  to  preeclampsia  is delivery or termination of pregnancy. 8.18.5.1.4.  Eclampsia  and  HELLP  Syndrome:    Patients  with  active  eclampsia  or HELLP Syndrome should not be moved. 8.18.5.2.  Placental disorders. 8.18.5.2.1.  Placental  abruption:   Premature  separation  of  normally  implanted placenta.  Placental  abruption  cannot  be  diagnosed  before  20  weeks  of  gestation. Cause  is  unknown  although  risk  factors  include  hypertension,  abdominal  trauma, short  umbilical  cord,  uterine  anomaly,  cocaine  use,  and  abruption  in  previous pregnancy.  Signs  and  symptoms  may  include  abdominal  pain  or  short,  frequent contractions, vaginal bleeding, change in maternal VS or change in fetal heart rate. If suspected abruption occurs in-flight,  patient  should be treated for hemorrhage/shock and C2 contacted for guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation. (T-2)  WARNING:  This is a life threatening condition for mother and baby. 8.18.5.2.2.  Placenta  previa:    Implantation  of  placenta  in  the  lower  uterine  segment, completely  or  partially  covering  the  internal  cervical  os.  Placenta  previa  cannot  be diagnosed before 20 weeks of gestation. Placenta previa may be stable or may result in  episodes  of  painless  vaginal  bleeding.  Should  an  unanticipated  bleed  occur  in-flight,  treat  for  hemorrhage/shock  and  contact  C2  for  guidance  and  diversion  to  a MTF capable of handling the situation. (T-2) WARNING:  A severe bleed or onset of labor is life threatening for mother and baby. 8.18.5.3.  Preterm  labor.  Progressive  cervical  dilation  and  effacement  prior  to  37  weeks of pregnancy. Signs and symptoms may include uterine contractions, back pain, vaginal discharge or bleeding, rupture of membranes, and pelvic pain. Preterm labor is generally slowed with medication and mother may be transported to facilitate higher level care for the premature infant.  There are no known effective treatments to stop preterm labor but may  successfully  prevent  delivery  long  enough  to  facilitate  transfer.  Normally  patients are not transported in active preterm labor. 8.18.5.4.  Gestational diabetes:  Diabetics diagnosed during pregnancy may be controlled by  a  combination  of  diet,  exercise,  oral  medication  and/or  insulin.  Gestational  diabetes should have orders for diet, glucose testing, and medications if needed. 8.18.5.5.  Medications used in high risk pregnancy: 8.18.5.5.1.  Magnesium  sulfate: in preeclampsia/eclampsia or for neuroprotection of the fetus in pre-term labor. It is also used to reduce uterine contractility in pre-term labor.   May  be  used  for  seizure  prophylaxis 8.18.5.5.1.1.  Magnesium sulfate is  a high risk medication and should  always be administered via infusion pump. WARNING:   May produce cardiac arrhythmia, bradycardia, or cardiac arrest.  Stop  infusion  if chest  pain  occurs. Contact  C2 for further guidance and possible diversion. (T-2) 8.18.5.5.1.2.  Maternal BP, respirations, strict I&O, and deep tendon reflex should be  monitored  carefully  during  magnesium  sulfate  therapy.  Patients  may 130 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 experience  flushing,  warmth,  dizziness,  and  malaise  as  normal  symptoms  of magnesium sulfate therapy. 8.18.5.5.1.3.  Patients  on  magnesium  sulfate  will  generally  have  orders  for  NPO or fluid restriction due to the risk of fluid overload. 8.18.5.5.1.4.  Magnesium sulfate toxicity:  Severe CNS depression and pulmonary edema  may  occur.  The  patient  should  be  stable  on  magnesium  sulfate  and/or serum  magnesium  sulfate  should  be  measured  for  therapeutic  levels  prior  to transport.  If  severe  lethargy,  slurred  speech,  decreased  respirations,  or  other symptoms  occur, infusion should be discontinued. Patient  should be placed on a cardiac monitor prior to administering magnesium sulfate and calcium  gluconate antidote may be administered per physician order if indicated. 8.18.5.5.2.  Tocolytic  agents:   Terbutaline,  nifedipine,  indomethacin,  and  less frequently,  magnesium  sulfate  may  be  used  for  inhibition  of  uterine  contractions. These  medications  will  tend  to  produce  flushing,  headache,  and  tachycardia. Generally they are effective in delaying delivery for 24-48 hrs. 8.18.5.5.3.  Treatment for Magnesium Sulfate Toxicity 8.18.5.5.3.1.  IV  access  -  central  line  (preferably)  and  arterial  line/Swan  Ganz (SG) may be present (insure balloon is deflated in SG prior to take-off). 8.18.5.5.3.2.  Infusion Pumps: Mainline/MgSO4 infusion. 8.18.5.5.3.3.  Foley catheter should be in place to monitor strict I & O. NOTE 1: Consider Left Lateral Recumbent position when monitoring Foley output. 8.18.5.5.3.4.  Calcium gluconate for MgSO4 toxicity. NOTE: Must be ordered on the patient treatment form and provided by the originating MTF. (T-0) NOTE 2: Not a part of the in-flight medical kit. 8.18.5.5.3.5.  Be  vigilant  for  loss  of  Deep  Tendon  Reflexes,  pulse  less  than 60/min; BP less than 90 mmHg/systolic; urine output less than 30cc/hour. 8.18.5.5.3.6.  Place on cardiac monitor. 8.18.5.5.3.7.  Administer  calcium  gluconate  10%  solution,  per  physician’s  order (usually 1 gram), slow IVP over 3 minutes. 8.18.5.5.4.  Steroids:    Betamethasone  injections  are  typically  given  to  women  when preterm delivery is threatened to promote fetal lung maturity. Betamethasone is given in 2 doses 24 hrs. apart and may result in an elevation in maternal blood glucose. 8.18.6.  In-flight considerations and care for unexpected labor and delivery. 8.18.6.1.  Contact  C2  for  guidance  and  diversion  to  a  MTF  capable  of  handling  the situation.  (T-2)  Request  the  receiving  facility  send  qualified  medical  personnel  to  the aircraft. 8.18.6.2.  Patient positioning for in-flight birth. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 131 8.18.6.2.1.  If  the  expectant  mother  is  a  litter  patient  and  there  is  another  patient underneath her, try to move the lower patient to another position. This way  you can facilitate care and privacy. 8.18.6.2.2.  If  ambulatory,  move  patient  to  a  litter.  Patient  may  be  positioned  side-lying, sitting with her back supported, or whatever position is most comfortable. 8.18.6.2.3.  Set  up  supplies  and  equipment  to  include  obstetric  pack,  doppler, absorbent pads, and blankets. 8.18.6.2.4.  Medical  or  non-medical  attendant  accompanying  patient  or  an  AECM should coach the mother to remain calm and if possible to avoid pushing until set up is complete. 8.18.6.2.5.  Start flowchart:  Obtain maternal VS q 1 hr. and FHTs q 15 mins. 8.18.6.2.6.  Start an IV of LR at 125ml/hr. depending on hydration and renal, cardiac, magnesium sulfate therapy and pulmonary status. 8.18.6.2.7.  Administer high flow O2 if needed. 8.18.6.2.8.  Delivery  procedures:    Follow  Lippincott  or  Mosby.  In  a  precipitous delivery,  support  baby’s  head  and  body  during  expulsion  and  guide  baby  to  the maternal abdomen. Maternal pushing efforts will generally facilitate delivery without any provider intervention. 8.18.6.2.9.  If neonatal resuscitation is required it should be performed by the medical attendant or AECM in accordance with Neonatal Resuscitation Program Guidelines. 8.18.6.3.  Immediate care of the newborn.  Infant  should be dried, stimulated and placed on the maternal abdomen. If needed, infant’s mouth and nose may be cleared with a bulb syringe. Suction the mouth first to avoid aspiration. If sterile scissors are available, cord may be clamped twice and cut, otherwise cord may be left intact. 8.18.6.3.1.  After delivery of placenta, place it in a towel or chux pad and then into a red biohazard bag with label. If cord is left intact, placenta should be placed near and approximately level to infant. The placenta will offload with the patient and will not be discarded. 8.18.6.3.2.  Breastfeeding should be encouraged within the first hr. of life to promote uterine involution and avoid neonatal hypoglycemia. Baby should be placed directly skin to skin with mom and both covered with a blanket to maintain temperature. 8.18.6.4.  Labor  and  delivery  and  postpartum  emergencies  -  all  of  these  emergencies require contacting C2 and diversion to a MTF capable of providing care. (T-2) 8.18.6.4.1.  Shoulder dystocia:  Following delivery of the fetal head the fetal anterior shoulder  may  become  stuck  on  the  pubic  bone  and  baby  will  appear  to  be  turtling. Delivery  of  the  shoulder  should  be  attempted  by  mother  assuming  McRoberts position  on  her  back  (flexion  of  maternal  legs),  suprapubic  pressure,  maternal position change to hands and knees, and attempting to rotate the fetal shoulders either towards each other to decrease the shoulder girdle or to rotate the fetus to the oblique to  deliver.  These  maneuvers  should  continue  to  be  attempted  until  the  fetus  is delivered or fetal death. 132 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.18.6.4.2.  Breech  presentation:    A  fetus  presenting  buttocks  or  feet  first  may  be delivered  vaginally  but  is  at  increased  risk  of  injury  or  cord  compression.  Allow maternal  pushing  efforts  to  occur  and  do  not  attempt  to  manipulate  the  baby  as  the gentle traction of the baby’s weight will provide support and facilitate delivery of the head. After delivery up to the fetal umbilicus you may assist the delivery of the arms by  sweeping  them  downward  if  they  do  not  deliver  spontaneously.  Following  birth, place the baby on the maternal abdomen to assess and provide routine care. 8.18.6.4.3.  Cord  prolapse:    The  umbilical  cord  precedes  the  presenting  part  and presents  a  risk  of  cord  compression  and  hypoxia  to  the  fetus.  This  is  most  likely  to occur following rupture of membranes and should be suspected if sudden decrease in FHT occurs with  rupture. The cord may be visualized at  the introitus  or palpated in the  vagina  alongside  the  presenting  part.  The  mother  should  be  placed  in trendelenburg or knee-chest  position and the presenting part should be lifted off the cord.  WARNING:    This  position  will  need  to  be  maintained  until  fetus  can  be delivered via cesarean section; do not discontinue until directed by a physician. (T-0) If cord prolapse occurs during second stage, baby may be delivered vaginally before cesarean can be performed. Assess fetal heart tones q 15 minutes. If baby is delivered, place on the maternal abdomen and assess for resuscitation. 8.18.6.4.4.  Postpartum  hemorrhage:    Blood  loss  greater  than  500  ml  following  a vaginal  delivery.  Patient  may  experience  dizziness,  fainting,  tachycardia,  and decreased  BP.  Treatment  for  hemorrhage  should  be  provided  along  with  aggressive fundal  massage.  Nipple  stimulation  may  be  provided  manually  or  through breastfeeding to encourage uterine contraction. 8.18.6.5.  Documentation. 8.18.6.5.1.  For the infant,  initiate an AF  Form 3899 or EHR equivalent,  AE patient record. Document time of birth; Apgar score at  one and five minutes post birth (per Lippincott); VS; and any concerns with labor. Document no vitamin K or ophthalmic ointment was given. Create a 3899 or EHR for newborn and document the same. Add infant to the AF Form 3830, Patient Manifest. 8.18.6.5.2.  On mother’s chart, annotate the following:  Course of labor; time of birth in  ZULU  time  (Universal  Time);  time  of  placenta  delivery  ZULU  time;  fundal massage and lochia checks; and VS q 15 mins for 2 hrs., then q 30 minutes for one hr., then every 4 hrs. for 24 hrs. 8.18.6.5.3.  Annotate events on AF Form 3829 (TRAC2ES Cover Sheet). 8.18.6.5.4.  Annotate events on DD Form 2852. (T-2) 8.18.7.  A  postpartum  mother  may  accompany  an  infant  to  more  definitive  care.  Ensure medication and supplies accompany the patient. If determined to be unstable, notify C2; the airlift  agency  will  contact  the  governing  PMRC  for  guidance  and  possible  diversion  to  a MTF capable of handling the situation. (T-2) If the patient is nursing the infant, all nursing supplies, breast pump and refrigeration capability is the responsibility of the patient/sending facility. 8.19.  Pediatric Management. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 133 8.19.1.  Stresses Of Flight. 8.19.1.1.  Decreased  Partial  Pressure  of  Oxygen:  Infants  and  younger  children  are  more reactive to hypoxia, and will become hypoxic earlier than adults. 8.19.1.2.  Barometric Pressure Changes: Encourage the use of a pacifier/bottle on descent to  help  the  infant/child  clear  their  ears.  Gastric  compression  may  restrict  diaphragmatic movement, especially if supine; elevate head and consider decompression with an oral or nasogastric tube if necessary. 8.19.1.3.  Thermal:  Thermal  changes  have  the  greatest  impact  on  infants  and  young children  who  have  a  very  sensitive  thermoregulating  system.  Increase  the  cabin temperature, if necessary and possible. 8.19.1.4.  Decreased Humidity: Infants and children are more susceptible to dehydration. If infant is in an Airborne Life Support System (ALSS), ensure that the proper amount of distilled sterile water is present in the humidification sponge. If not NPO or receiving IVs or  tube  feedings,  give  fluids  at  least  every  two  hours.  NOTE:  Assess  for  infant dehydration: palpate for depressed anterior fontanel. 8.19.1.5.  Noise: Infants/children are sensitive to excessive noise. Earplugs should be cut in  half  (vertically)  to  fit  the  smaller  ear  canals.  Infants  in  ALSS  should  also  wear earplugs, even though the double paned construction muffles aircraft noise. 8.19.1.6.  Vibration: Ensure infants are padded when in car seats or the incubator. 8.19.1.7.  Fatigue:  Fatigue  has  the  greatest  impact  on  pediatric  patients’  newborn  to  12 years old. 8.19.2.  General Considerations: 8.19.2.1.  Assess airway and breathing: is the child able to maintain independently or are adjuncts/assistance to maintain patency required? 8.19.2.1.1.  Respiratory  dysfunction  is  the  most  common  cause  of  cardiac  arrest  so stabilization of the airway is of primary concern. Assess rate; mechanics (retractions, grunting,  nasal  flaring,  use  of  accessory  muscles);  chest  expansion,  breath  sounds stridor, wheezing or paradoxical chest movement. 8.19.2.1.2.  Proper  positioning  is  essential  because  a  child’s  trachea  is  narrow,  the tongue is large and intercostal muscles are weak. 8.19.2.1.3.  Use jaw thrust or chin lift maneuver to open the airway. 8.19.2.1.4.  For spinal immobilization use jaw thrust. WARNING: Hyperextension or flexion  of  the  neck  will  cause  airway  compression.  A  rolled  towel  placed  under  the shoulders  of  the  infant  or  child  aids  in  maximizing  airway  size  and  reducing resistance.  For  neutral  alignment  of  the  C-Spine,  align  the  external  auditory  meatus with the shoulders. 8.19.2.2.  If  intubated,  there  should  be  a  medical  attendant  accompanying  the  patient capable of managing the airway and a ventilator. 8.19.2.2.1.  Use cuffless endotracheal tubes up to age ten. 134 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.19.2.2.2.  Have on hand one size larger and one size smaller endotracheal tube. 8.19.2.2.3.  Monitor  pulse  oximetry  and  titrate  O2  to  maintain  SaO2  greater  than 93%. 8.19.2.2.4.  Ensure adequate humidification of the O2 delivery systems. 8.19.2.2.5.  Assess  color  (pale  or  cyanotic);  capillary  refill;  skin  temperature; presence of mottling. 8.19.2.3.  Vital  Signs:  Normal  Heart  Rate.  Count  apical  pulse  for  a  full  minute. WARNING:  Bradycardia is  life threatening and  is  associated with  hypoxemia, perform CPR if the child is bradycardic with poor perfusion or is pulseless. 8.19.2.3.1.  Infant: 120-160/min. 8.19.2.3.2.  Toddler: 90 – 8.190/ min. 8.19.2.3.3.  Preschool: 80 - 110/min. 8.19.2.3.4.  School age: 75 - 110/min. 8.19.2.3.5.  Adolescent: 60 – 90/min. 8.19.2.4.  Normal  Respiratory  Rate.  Count  for  a  full  minute.  NOTE:  a  respiratory  rate greater than 60/min is abnormal for any child. 8.19.2.4.1.  Infant: 30 - 60/min. 8.19.2.4.2.  Toddler: 20– 40/min. 8.19.2.4.3.  Preschool: 20 - 30/min. 8.19.2.4.4.  School age: 18 - 30/min. 8.19.2.4.5.  Adolescent: 12 – 16/min. 8.19.2.5.  Blood  Pressure. Average systolic pressure for children one  year old  and over: (Age in  years  X 2)  + 90mm Hg;  lower limit: (Age in  years X 2) + 70mm  Hg indicates hypotension. 8.19.2.6.  Skin Color. Cyanosis is a late sign of hypoxia. 8.19.2.7.  Mental Status/Level of Activity. Active and alert? Lethargic or unresponsive? 8.19.2.8.  Urine Output. 8.19.2.8.1.  Infant: 2 ml/kg/hr. 8.19.2.8.2.  Child over 2 yr: 1 ml/kg/hr. 8.19.2.9.  Offer  fluids  every  one  to  two  hours  (unless  contraindicated).    NOTE:  IV infusion pumps will be used for all neonatal/pediatric patients. (T-0) 8.19.2.10.  CNS perfusion: responsiveness and recognizes parents. 8.19.2.11.  Muscle tone. 8.19.2.12.  Pupil size, posturing. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 135 8.19.3.  Rapid  Cardiopulmonary  Assessment/Treatment.  Refer BLS/ACLS/PALS guidelines.  to current  AHA 8.19.3.1.  Early  recognition  of  the  symptoms  of  progressive  deterioration  in  respiratory and circulatory function and prompt initiation of therapy can often prevent cardiac arrest. WARNING:  Bradycardia  is  life  threatening  and  is  associated  with  hypoxia;  CPR  is indicated  if  the  child  is  bradycardic  with  poor  perfusion  or  is  pulseless.  Notify AOC/PMRC  for  guidance  and  possible  diversion  to  a  MTF  capable  of  handling  the situation. 8.19.4.  Assessment of Signs/Symptoms of Severe Respiratory Distress. Notify AOC/ PMRC for guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation. 8.19.4.1.  Respiratory  Distress:  Respiratory  rate  over  60  per  minute,  grunting  or  forced expiration, and head bobbing. 8.19.4.1.1.  Retractions: Use of  accessory muscles:  sternal  retractions, chest  muscles visibly pulling and prolonged expiratory time. 8.19.4.1.2.  Nasal  Flaring.  Obligated  nose  breathers  for  the  first  four  months  of  life. Keep nares clear of secretions. 8.19.4.1.3.  Cardiovascular: poor peripheral perfusion, tachycardia. 8.19.4.1.4.  Neurological: decreased muscle tone, altered mental status. 8.19.4.1.5.  Pallor precedes cyanosis. Assess capillary refill (<2 seconds). 8.19.5.

Monitor infant/child closely during actual descent. Encourage the use of a pacifier/bottle. If crying during descent, this will usually clear the ears. 8.19.7.9.2.  Instruct nose-blowing technique for valsalva. 8.20.  Mental Health Patient Management. 8.20.1.  Stresses of flight. 8.20.1.1.  Decreased  partial  pressure  of  oxygen  and  low  humidity,  may  exacerbate  the effects of mental health patients. 8.20.1.1.1.  Rule out hypoxia. 8.20.1.1.2.  Exacerbates effects of medication. 8.20.1.2.  Noise,  fatigue,  vibration,  thermal  changes  in  the  aircraft  and  prolonged confinement  place  both  physical  and  psychological  stress  on  patients.  NOTE:  With psychiatric  patients,  this  stress  may  be  manifested  by  heightened  awareness;  mood changes to include increased irritability, depression, apprehension, paranoia, excitability or worsening suicidal thoughts. 8.20.2.  The acute exacerbation of psychiatric or behavioral disorders in-flight may place the aircraft,  crew,  other  patients,  and  passengers  at  risk.  If  a  patient  presents  a  risk  to  flight safety,  a  danger  to  themselves  or  others,  restraints  may  be  required.  The  goal  is  to  use  the safest  and  least  restrictive  measures  to  control  behavior  within  the  AE  environment  while maintaining the patient’s dignity. 8.20.2.1.  Physicians, nurses, MAs, and family members may be used to comfort and talk to the patient. 8.20.2.2.  An  extra  headset  from  the  wireless  communication  system  if  needed  may  be used  with  the  patient  to  be  able  to  comfort  and  talk  with  the  patient.  Assure  HIPAA  is followed with communications. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 139 8.20.3.  Patient classifications. See Section 3.7. 8.20.4.  Validation criteria of mental health patients. 8.20.4.1.  Validation must look carefully for signs that mental health patients may have a change of status during flight that may directly threaten the aircraft or personnel onboard. (T-0)The  most  helpful  information  to  the  VFS  can  be  ascertained  by  asking  the originating mental health and medical staff, “what has the patient actually said or done?” 8.20.4.2.  The  VFS  needs  to  know  if  the  patient  is  a  danger  to  self,  others,  or  the aircraft/facility. 8.20.4.3.  The  MCD  may  refuse  a  patient  for  AE  transport  if  the  patient’s  behavior  is determined  to  be  detrimental  to  self  and  others,  the  patient  has  not  been  adequately prepared for AE movement, the AE crew is unable to make corrections before departure, and  therapeutic  interventions  are  ineffective.  Document  in  the  health  record  and  notify C2.  The  airlift  agency  will  contact  the  governing  PMRC  at  time  of  refusal.  (T-2)  The MCD completes and submits a DD Form 2852. (T-2) 8.20.5.  General considerations for mental health patients. 8.20.5.1.  Physical  factors:    Age,  cognitive  level,  sleep  patterns,  nutrition/hydration, elimination, touch, comfort, and physical activity. If appropriate based on classification, allow ambulation, sitting in “get up” seats, “stretch breaks” at en route stops, and comfort breaks. Offer fluids and nutrition frequently. 8.20.5.2.  Pathophysiological  factors:    Drug  interactions,  substance  abuses,  dehydration, poor nutrition, underlying disease/illness, and metabolic and endocrine disturbances. 8.20.5.2.1.  Correct  underlying  pathology detoxification). 8.20.5.2.2.  Observe for and treat hypoxia. (dehydration; alcohol and  drug 8.20.5.2.3.  Sedated patients may be more susceptible to dehydration and/or hypoxia, and aspiration during patient movement. 8.20.5.2.4.  Assure adequate hydration and nutrition. 8.20.5.3.  Psychological factors:  Anxiety/fear, fatigue, depression/grief, denial, boredom, communication barriers, stress, and post-traumatic stress. NOTE:  History of physical or sexual abuse may affect individual reactions to physical contact and place the individual at  greater  psychological  distress.  Mental  health  patients  are  typically  physically  healthy and  therefore  capable  of  independent  actions  that  could  directly  threaten  the  aircrew, patient  staging  personnel  and  other  patients.  If  the  patient  is  exhibiting  aggressive  and uncontrollable  behavior,  is  extremely  agitated  or  violent  and/or  is  determined  to  be  a danger to flight safety, self or others, give as needed (PRN) medication as ordered. If no PRN  medication  is  ordered,  give  Haldol  or  Valium  in  accordance  with  AE  Clinical Protocol – Acute Exacerbation of Mental Health or Behavior Disorders. Consult with the  PMRC  VFS  and  AOC/AECT  for  guidance  and  possible  diversion  to  a  Medical Treatment Facility capable of handling the situation and for further medical direction as soon as operationally feasible. 140 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.20.5.4.  Environmental  factors: temperature, aircraft systems, and personal items.   Confined  space,  noise, lighting,  positioning, 8.20.6.  Physician orders for mental health patients. 8.20.6.1.  The  originating  physician  will  write  orders  for  routine  medication  as  well  as PRN medication for increasing symptoms while the patient is in the AE system. (T-3) 8.20.6.2.  Extremely  high-risk  mental  health  patients  should  travel  with  an  experienced psychiatric  technician/RN  or  medical  provider  capable  of  recognizing  the  need  for  the medication administration and/or providing specialized care. 8.20.6.3.  The requirement for a MA should be determined by the originating physician in consultation with the PMRC VFS. NOTE:  All mental health patients requiring ongoing supervision will, preferably, have a MA of the same gender, commensurate rank during movement between the originating and the destination facility. (T-0) 8.20.7.  Preflight/in-flight care for mental health patients. 8.20.7.1.  General: 8.20.7.1.1.  Position  litter  patients  in  the  lowest  litter  space,  away  from  the  flight deck, emergency exits, and O2 shutoff valves. Assign ambulatory patients a seat near the  bulkhead,  away  from  the  flight  deck,  emergency  exits  and  O2  shut  off  valves. Assess potential safety risks of nearby objects and cargo. 8.20.7.1.2.  Inform flight crew as to where the mental health patient is placed on the aircraft  and  where  they  are  at  all  times.  For  confidentiality  purposes,  no  further information is given. 8.20.7.1.3.  Give  clear  behavioral  expectations  (examples:    seatbelts,  no  smoking, stretch  breaks,  no  access  to  the  flight  deck,  and  use  of  the  lavatory)  and  establish  a verbal contract, including when medication or restraints can be used. 8.20.7.1.4.  Use  neutral  language  and  speak  in  a  non-threatening,  non-judgmental manner. 8.20.7.1.5.  Mental health inpatients and their hand-carried bags will be searched by an AECM for sharps, matches, lighters and cigarettes prior to enplaning. (T-0) These items will be inventoried, secured, and deplaned to the receiving MTF. (T-2) Use AF Form  3854,  Receipt  of  Valuables.  Litter  patients  are  allowed  to  carry  eyeglasses, toothbrush, and a small amount of money, wedding band, rings, wristwatch, ID card, and wallet. 8.20.7.1.6.  The  designated  MA  or  AECM  will  maintain  line-of-sight  or  one-to-one observation  of  patients  in  restraints  and/or  with  suicidal,  homicidal  or  elopement precautions.  (T-2) Assign one AECM, preferably the same gender to act as the team leader.  This  caregiver  will  coordinate  with  the  MCD  and  the  MA  should  further interventions be required. (T-2) 8.20.7.1.7.  Disposable  eating  utensils  do  not  need  to  be  removed  for  high-risk patients but should be inventoried when trays are collected. 8.20.7.1.8.  Offer fluids every 2 hrs. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 141 8.20.7.1.9.  Medications  are  to  be  given  preflight  and  PRN  if  behavior  becomes unmanageable.  Monitor  SpO2  and  temperature  for  patients  on  antipsychotic medications (i.e. risperidone, olanzapine). 8.20.7.1.9.1.  Determine whether medication is effective. Document findings. 8.20.7.1.9.2.  Body  temperature  of  102°F  and  above  along  with  increased agitation  while  on  antipsychotic  medication  may  indicate  neuroleptic  malignant syndrome (NMS) which can be life-threatening. If symptoms appear preflight, the patient  is  not  stable  for  flight.  Notify  C2;  the  airlift  agency  will  contact  the governing  PMRC.  (T-2)  WARNING:    If  symptoms  appear  in-flight,  hold medication, monitor VS, apply cooling blanket if available. Assess for increased agitation,  which  may  require  PRN  anti-anxiety  medication  as  ordered  by  the physician. Document the medication administration; notify C2; the airlift agency will contact the governing PMRC. (T-2) such  as  Haldol,  may  cause 8.20.7.1.9.3.  High  potency  neuroleptics, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) within hrs. or days after starting medication. EPS may present  as muscle spasms or distortion of the neck, jaw, tongue, rotating of the  eyes,  or  inability  to  be  still.  Other  side  effects  may  include  cardiac irregularities, hypotension, respiratory suppression, and over-sedation. Patients on these medications should have orders to treat possibility of EPS. WARNING:  If symptoms  appear  in-flight  and  no  orders  are  available,  hold  neuroleptic medications,  and  notify  C2  for  further  instruction.  (T-2)  Cogentin  and  Benadryl are  available  in  the  in-flight  kit  (IFK).  The  airlift  agency  will  contact  the governing  PMRC  for  guidance  and  possible  diversion  to  a  MTF  capable  of handling this emergent situation. (T-2) WARNING:  If previously untreated EPS symptoms are present preflight, the patient is not stable for flight. Notify C2; the airlift agency will contact the governing PMRC. (T-2) 8.20.8.  Acute  exacerbation  of  psychiatric  or  behavior  disorder.  If  the  patient  is  exhibiting aggressive  and  uncontrollable  behavior,  is  extremely  agitated  and  violent,  and/or  is determined  to  be  a  danger  to  flight  safety,  self  or  others  on  the  aircraft,  administer  PRN medication  as  ordered.  Consult  C2  and  the  PMRC  for  guidance,  medication  orders  and possible  diversion  to  a  MTF  capable  of  handling  the  situation.  If  no  PRN  medication  is ordered,  give  Haldol  or  Valium  in  accordance  with  AE  Clinical  Protocol  –  Acute Exacerbation of Mental Health or Behavior Disorders. Consult with the PMRC VFS and AOC/AECT  for  guidance  and  possible  diversion  to  a    Medical  Treatment  Facility  (MTF) capable  of  handling  the  situation  and  for  further  medical  direction  as  soon  as  operationally feasible. (T-2) 8.20.8.1.  An AECM trained and competent in the application of restraints will act as the team leader and coordinate with the MCD and the MA. (T-2) The team leader establishes and is responsible for patient interaction while en route. 8.20.8.2.  The  safest  and  least  restrictive  alternative  methods  for  controlling  violent  and uncontrollable behavior in the AE environment will be utilized. (T-0) These include but are not limited to: 142 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.20.8.2.1.  Countermeasures.  Appropriate  use  of  medications  and/or  physical restraints  in  AE  should  be  used  to  prevent  patients  from  physically  harming themselves,  others,  or  becoming  a  safety  risk  to  the  flight.  The  least  restrictive methods  should  be  used  to  maintain  safety  of  the  patient,  others  and  the  aircraft. Verbal deescalating techniques should always be used first. De-escalating techniques can include allowing the patient to verbalize their feelings in an appropriate manner and  talking  to  the  patient  in  a  calm  but  firm  direction.  An  extremely  agitated,  high-risk  patient  may  require  an  upgraded  classification  or  may  need  to  stay  behind. Appropriate standing PRN medications (PO/IM) should be used. 8.20.8.2.2.  Verbal de-escalation, verbal contract, explanation of consequences for not changing behavior, MA/family intervention, and medication as ordered. 8.20.8.2.3.  Perform  brief  examination  to  rule  out  and  treat  underlying  organic medical  causes  of  agitation  to  include  but  not  limited  to  hypoxia,  hypoglycemia, alcohol/drug intoxication  or  withdrawal,  medication  effect/overdose,  and hypotension. 8.20.8.2.4.  Assessment  to  include  but  not  limited  to  orientation  to  time,  person  and place,  ability  to  follow  commands/recall  directions,  or  accepts  limits  and  reliably contracts  for  safety.  Identify  if  a  danger  to  flight  safety,  increased  risk  to  self  or others, or too agitated/violent and needs sedatives administered. NOTE:  If attempts at verbal de-escalation have failed and the patient is extremely violent, out of control, or a threat to flight safety, then medicate with prescribed PRN medications and apply restraints. Call C2 and request a patch to the PMRC if in-flight or call the VFS if in the staging facility. (T-2)  NOTE:  If this situation occurs prior to takeoff, the patient is not stable for flight. The patient will be stabilized with medication prior to take-off in coordination with C2, PMRC, and/or local physician. (T-2) The mission should not be delayed in order to meet this requirement. 8.20.8.3.  When  alternative  measures  are  unsuccessful,  the  MCD,  as  the  AECM  team leader,  and the MA, will: 8.20.8.3.1.  Ensure the patient, the crew, and others are not in immediate danger. (T-0) 8.20.8.3.2.  Direct the notification of the flight crew to include securing access to the flight deck. (T-0) 8.20.8.3.3.  Make every effort to maintain the patient’s dignity and privacy. (T-0) 8.20.8.3.4.  Inform  the  patient  and  family  member  (if  present)  he/she  has  escalating symptoms, and the crew is assuming control until he/she is able to regain control. (T-0) 8.20.8.3.5.  If  restraints  are  required,  apply  IAW  AFI  10-2909  and  follow  the  AE Clinical  Protocol  -  Acute  Exacerbation  of  Mental  Health  or  Behavioral Disorders. (T-0) 8.20.9.  Management  of  patients  requiring  restraints  in  the  AE  environment.  WARNING:  When applying physical restraints, there is a potential to produce serious consequences, such AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 143 as physical  and psychological  harm, loss of dignity, violation of an individual’s rights,  and even death. 8.20.9.1.  The goal for restraint use is to provide the most effective method to ensure and maintain  the  safety  of  the  patient  and  staff/aircrew.  Restraints  may  also  be  utilized  for patients at risk for dislodging vital therapeutic devices. 8.20.9.2.  Restraints will not be applied as punishment or for crew convenience. 8.20.10.  Physician written time limited orders for restraints: (T-2) 8.20.10.1.  Physicians  will  annotate  restraint  orders  on  AF  Form  3899F  or  EHR equivalent. (T-1) Each order for physical restraints must cover the timeframe the patient is in the AE system. (T-0) A PRN restraint order is not a valid order. 8.20.10.2.  In an emergency, FN or RN may initiate the use of restraints before an order is obtained. The MCD/FN may determine a patient requires restraints or the patient requires the  continuation  of  restraints  in  the  AE  environment  beyond  initial  order.  In  either situation, the use of restraints will not exceed 24 hrs. 8.20.10.3.  Document  application,  continuation  of  restraints  and  clinical  observations  to the governing PMRC through C2. (T-2) 8.20.10.4.  After the original restraint order is obtained, the patient must receive face-to-face assessment by a physician or licensed independent practitioner, usually done at the RON or destination facility, whichever is sooner. (T-0) 8.20.10.5.  In  the  AE  system,  contact  C2  when  restraints  are  initiated  without  an  order. Document all C2 contact attempts/contacts on AF Form 3899 EHR or equivalent.  (T-2) NOTE:    In  the  AE  system  contact  C2  and  PMRC  with  any  change  in  the  patient’s condition and notify C2 of the delay of the time frames below. (T-2) 8.20.10.6.  The  following  time  constraints  are  ideally  required  for  physician  assessment after initiation of restraints: 8.20.10.6.1.  Four (4) hrs. for adults. 8.20.10.6.2.  Two (2) hrs. for children and adolescents age 9 to 17. 8.20.10.6.3.  One (1) hr. for patients under age 9. 8.20.11.  Level of observation required for patients in restraints. 8.20.11.1.  Restrained patients should be directly observed for the duration of the restraint episode. During the restraint period, the MCD/FN may remove wrist restraints but not the ankle  restraints.  This  is  consistent  with  maintaining  flight  safety  and  facilitates  patient feeding and other personal activities while the patient adapts to the AE environment. 8.20.12.  Documentation of patient in restraints and release criteria. 8.20.12.1.  Patient assessment and behavior/justification for PRN sedation medication or restraint application. 8.20.12.2.  Date/time of administration of medication and/or application of restraints, and outcome. 8.20.12.3.  Date/time of notification of the physician. 144 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.20.12.4.  Complete DD Form 2852. (T-2) 8.20.12.5.  Maintain direct observation, including during take-off and landing. 8.20.12.6.  Perform  neurovascular  assessment  to  extremities  and  document  observations every 15 minutes according to AF Form 3899Gor EHR equivalent. 8.20.12.7.  Assess hydration, nutrition, skin integrity, and toileting needs every 2 hrs. 8.20.12.8.  Turn and reposition patient at least once every 2 hrs., removing one extremity restraint at a time to check skin integrity. 8.20.12.9.  Perform skin care to the area and ROM exercises at least once every 2 hrs. 8.20.12.10.  Leg restraints should not be removed while in-flight. During patient staging, if the patient is reassessed by a physician, the physician may write an order to remove the restraints. 8.20.13.  Alcohol and drug withdrawal. 8.20.13.1.  Level  of  withdrawal  is  determined  according  to  the  clinical  institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol (CIWA) guidelines. Refer to Attachment 12. 8.20.13.2.  Signs  and  symptoms  may  be  mild-moderate  such  as  restlessness,  agitation, anxiety, and fear, nausea, vomiting, malaise, weakness, tachycardia, diaphoresis, elevated temperature, tremors, and dilated but reactive pupils. 8.20.13.2.1.  Critical symptoms may include abnormal VS, tremors, seizures, delirium (fluctuating mental status), and hallucinations. 8.20.13.2.2.  A detoxification period of 3-5 days is required to be accepted for flight. 8.20.13.2.3.  If  residual  withdrawal  symptoms  are  present,  patient  must  have  IV access. (T-3) 8.20.13.2.4.  Medications per AE Clinical Protocol - Acute Exacerbation of Mental Health or Behavior Disorders Medication Administration. 8.20.13.2.5.  Documentation will include subjective and objective data for giving the medication;  VS;  known  allergies;  for  women  of  childbearing  years:  date  of  last menstrual cycle; date and time of administration and notification of a physician, and the outcome. (T-0) The following statement will be documented on AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent “(Insert name of drug) was administered IAW AE Clinical Protocol -  Acute  Exacerbation  of  Mental  Health  or  Behavior  Disorders.

Documentation  of  administration  of  medication  on  the  AF  Form 3899I or EHR equivalent and the patient’s response to the medication. 8.20.13.2.6.3.  Documentation of notification to the PMRC VFS and AOC/AECT agency. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 145 8.20.13.2.6.4.  Completion of the DD Form 2852. (T-2) 8.20.14.  Acute stress disorder/post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). 8.20.14.1.  Special  consideration  should  be  given  to  mental  health  patients  experiencing acute  stress  reactions  and  PTSD.  Acute  stress  and  PTSD  develop  after  experiencing  a psychologically  traumatic  event  outside  the  range  of  usual  experience  (e.g.  combat, bombings, sexual assault). 8.20.14.1.1.  Individuals  may  re-experience  the  event  through  recurrent  thoughts, images, flashback episodes and dreams. 8.20.14.1.2.  Individuals  may  present  with  symptoms  such  as  increased  arousal  or irritability, sleep deprivation, hypervigilance,  exaggerated startled  response, survival guilt, poor concentration, anxiety and motor restlessness. 8.20.14.2.  Assess  for  signs  and  symptoms  (may  be  associated  with  other  injuries:  Tremors,  profuse  sweating,  dry  mouth, tachycardia,  shortness  of  breath  and hyperventilation (rule out hypoxia), irritability, flat affect, staring, crying, insomnia, and avoidant or emotional numbness). NOTE:  May be more prone to violent and aggressive behaviors while in the AE environment due to stress of flight. 8.20.14.3.  Treatment/Management begins as soon as symptoms are noticed. 8.20.14.3.1.  Keep  acute  stress  disorder/PTSD  patients  together  for  mutual  support and away from other patients, if feasible. Provide comfort measures to include fluids, nutrition, blankets, and medications. 8.20.14.3.2.  Talk  to  patients  in  a  calm,  reassuring  manner,  avoid  approaching individual from behind and keep from touching if possible. 8.20.14.3.3.  Anxiolytic  medications  may  be  necessary  preflight  and  in-flight  for increased anxiety, extreme agitation, and restlessness. 8.20.15.  Post-mission/RON requirements. 8.20.15.1.  The  receiving  MA  will  assume  responsibility  of  the  patient  and  remain  with the patient at all times until released.  (T-2) In consultation with the MCD, this MA, if a physician or licensed independent practitioner, determines if restraints will be continued during transportation to the MTF. Restraints will not be placed for the convenience of the receiving facility. (T-2) Continuity of care and patient dignity will be maintained en route to the receiving MTF. 8.20.15.2.  A  physician  or  licensed  independent  practitioner  will  perform  a  face-to-face reassessment of the patient to determine if restraints are to be continued while in the AE environment. (T-0) 8.20.15.3.  The physician or licensed independent practitioner at the RON site will review the  FN’s  determination  to  apply  restraints  and/or  administer  PRN  sedation  medications en route.   (T-0) 8.20.15.4.  Higher acuity psychiatric patients ( i.e., 1A or 1B) or alcohol abuse patients, or  in  extreme  situations  where  a  patient  has  required  restraints  for  more  than  24  hrs., 146 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 RON bed may be required at an off-base psychiatric facility. Notify PMRC personnel of requirements in the event of unscheduled RON’s. 8.21.  Pain Management. 8.21.1.  Stresses of flight. 8.21.1.1.  Decreased partial pressure of oxygen:  Decreases tissue oxygen availability and will  exacerbate  oxygenation  deficiencies  due  to  preexisting  hypoxias  related  to  injury, disease, and/or treatment. May exacerbate the CNS effects of pain medication. 8.21.1.2.  Barometric pressure changes:  Gas expansion in the abdominal cavity at cruise altitude may lead to  crowding of the diaphragm  increasing pain  and splinting. Splinting and diaphragmatic crowding decreases lung volume and expansion, and may exacerbate the risk of hypoxia. Consider placing a nasogastric tube. 8.21.1.3.  Thermal:    Cold  temperatures  may  lead  to  vasoconstriction,  shivering  and exacerbated pain. Keep patient warm and limit exposure to cold temperatures. 8.21.1.4.  Vibration/turbulence:  Increases muscle activity, metabolic rate, and peripheral vasoconstriction. Avoid excessive speed of ground transportation assets. Secure patients away from the bulkhead and floor of  ground vehicles and aircraft, encourage and  assist with  position  changes,  and  provide  adequate  padding  and  skin  care,  especially  for orthopedic patients with internal/external fixators. 8.21.1.5.  Gravitational forces:  Seat belts in side-facing and rear-facing seats may cause injury during acceleration/deceleration; use extra padding between abdomen and seat belt for patients with abdominal surgery. 8.21.1.6.  Fatigue:    Exacerbates  the  patient’s  underlying  condition/diagnosis  due  to  the overall effect of previously mentioned stresses of flight, and length of time the patient has been in the AE system. 8.21.2.  General:    Pain  is  a  complex  experience  with  multiple  dimensions  and  is  always subjective.  Pain  is  defined  by  the  International  Association  for  the  Study  of  Pain  as  an unpleasant  sensory  and  emotional  experience  associated  with  actual  or  potential  tissue damage,  or  described  in  terms  of  such  damage.  NOTE:    The  inability  to  communicate verbally does not negate the possibility that an individual is experiencing pain and is in need of  appropriate  pain-relieving  treatment.  NOTE:  Do  not  give  supplemental  acetaminophen (Tylenol) with oral narcotics containing acetaminophen as this may lead to toxicity risks. 8.21.2.1.  Undertreated  and  poorly  managed  pain  may  lead  to  adverse  physical  and psychological  consequences  and  complications  such  as  pneumonia,  VTE,  delayed recovery and/or progression to chronic pain. Reassessment of pain is required whenever the  patient’s  environment  changes.    Pain  management  needs  change  frequently  and  can dictate whether transport is possible (or recommended). 8.21.2.2.  For  any  patient  with  escalating  pain  control  requirements,  vigilant  monitoring and documentation during and after all interventions is mandatory to assess the patient’s response  to  therapy  and  to  prevent  problems  such  as  over-sedation  and  airway obstruction.  Proper  documentation  of  orders,  VS,  pulse-oximetry  monitoring,  patient response and a coordinated hand-off when providers change duties is critical. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 147 8.21.2.2.1.  Phenergan is sedating and when used with opioids may increase the risk of  respiratory  depression.  Respiratory  depression,  airway  obstruction,  and  apnea  are much  more  common  when  these  medications  are  used  in  combination.  Tolerance  to respiratory-depressant  effects  usually  develop  within  1  week  of  starting  regularly scheduled opioid therapy. Phenergan will not be given IV in the AE system. 8.21.2.2.2.  Benzodiazepines,  such  as  diazepam,  clonazepam,  or  lorazepam,  due  to their  sedative  and  respiratory  depressant  effects,  should  be  used  cautiously  with opioids. The opioids’ dose may need to be decreased. Respiratory depression, airway obstruction, and apnea are much more common  when these medications  are used in combination. 8.21.2.2.3.  Frequent  monitoring  of  VS,  including  Motor  Activity  Assessment  Scale (MAAS) sedation score, is essential not only when administering the medications, but for 15 – 30 minutes further to ensure these complications do not occur. 8.21.3.  Pain  assessment:    When  assessing  pain,  always  rule  out  and  treat  life-threatening conditions, such as cardiac pain/pulmonary embolism. 8.21.3.1.  Indicators of pain by hierarchy: 8.21.3.1.1.  Patient self-report – single most reliable measure of intensity of pain. 8.21.3.1.2.  Pathological conditions or procedures known to be painful. 8.21.3.1.3.  Observed  pain-related  behaviors  (grimacing,  restlessness,  vocalization, groaning). 8.21.3.1.4.  Reports of pain by family or attendant. 8.21.3.1.5.  Physiological changes (increased pulse and BP). 8.21.3.2.  Types of pain scales. When choosing a pain scale, select the one that best aligns with the age and condition of the patient. Refer to Attachment 13. 8.21.3.2.1.  0-10 Numeric Pain Rating Scale. 8.21.3.2.1.1.  Most commonly based on a scale from zero to 10. 8.21.3.2.1.2.  Zero  represents  no  pain  at  all  while  10  represents  the  worst imaginable pain. 8.21.3.2.2.  Wong-Baker faces. 8.21.3.2.2.1.  Represented  by  faces  with  expressions.  Zero  is  represented  by  a smiley face, while 10 is represented as a distraught, crying face. 8.21.3.2.2.2.  Useful  when  rating  pain  in  children,  or  for  adults  with  mild cognitive impairments. 8.21.3.2.3.  Defense  and  Veterans  Pain  Rating  Scale  (DVPRS).  This  scale  includes visual  cues  and  verbal  descriptors  to  improve  interpretability  of  incremental  pain intensity levels supplemental questions assess pain interference with general activity, sleep, mood, and stress. 148 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.21.3.2.4.  Face, Legs, Activity, Crying and Consolability (FLACC). Observer rated pain scale for children between the ages of 2 and 7 and for people who are unable to communicate their pain (e.g. ventilator patients). 8.21.3.3.  Obtain VS (including pulse oximetry) and assess pain  at least every 4 hrs. for patients  who  require  en  route  pain  medication  administration.  Rule  out  hypoxia  and consider compartment syndrome. radiation,  what 8.21.3.4.  Determine  characteristics  of  pain: provokes/triggers coughing), and palliates/eases  (repositioning/elevation/support/medication),  and  the  adequacy/adverse effects of pain medication. changes/deep  breathing (movement/dressing   Quality, region, 8.21.3.5.  Ascertain  the  patient’s  pain  level  and  their  acceptable  level  of  pain.  The acceptable level of pain is the level of pain the patient is willing to tolerate. Respect the patient’s  self-report  of  pain.  NOTE:    Individual  practice  may  lead  to  differences  in delivery  of  pain  medication.  NOTE:    Healthcare  providers’  bias,  prejudice  and stereotyping  may  lead  to  differences  in  delivery  of  pain  medication.  Avoid  attributing pain to psychological causes, and respect/accept patient’s self-report of pain. 8.21.3.6.  If appropriate, educate the patient on the availability of medications. 8.21.3.7.  A  pain  score  of  3  or  more  usually  indicates  the  need  for  pain  medication. Assess  current  medications  to  evaluate  potential  interactions  to  include  hypoxia  before administering pain medication. 8.21.3.8.  Pain should be reassessed as ordered and after interventions. 8.21.3.8.1.  Pain  and  VS  will  be  reassessed  15-30  minutes  after  pharmacologic interventions.   (T-3) 8.21.3.8.2.  Take  into  consideration  the  type  of  medication,  time  of  onset  based  on route, and duration of known effectiveness. 8.21.3.9.  When operationally feasible: 8.21.3.9.1.  Assess  cultural  attitudes, helplessness, mental functioning, mood, and fear of pain. stoicism,  guilt,  potential frustration, 8.21.3.9.2.  Educate  patients,  family,  and  attendants  regarding  reporting  pain, availability of pain  medication, as well as, the low risk of  addiction  from long-term use  and/or  high  doses  of  medication  for  pain  relief,  and  document  in  the  health record. NOTE:  Include information about PRN medications being available around-the-clock. 8.21.4.  Pain:  Treatment/management: 8.21.4.1.  Administer  pain  medication,  as  ordered,  prior  to  potential  painful  events  such as transportation movement and en route staging treatments and dressing changes. Take into consideration the type of pain medication, time of onset based on route, and duration of  known  effectiveness.  For  example,  opioid  analgesic  onset  is  immediate  when administered  intravenously,  and  rapid  when  administered  via  intramuscular  and  oral routes  (approximately  30  -  60  minutes);  duration  is  usually  1-  8  hrs.  Also  consider AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 149 adjunct  medications  such  as  anxiolytics.  NOTE:    Document  all  known  allergies  in  the health record. 8.21.4.2.  Assess  adequacy  of  pain  medication  at  all  patient  care  hand-offs,  en  route staging  locations  and  in-flight.  Consider  medication  for  breakthrough  pain  (pain  that occurs  in  between  regularly  scheduled  doses  of  pain  medication).  Start  pain  control  at least  60  minutes  prior  to  patient  movement  from  bedside  (en  route  to  aircraft)  when feasible.  NOTE:    If  medication  is  inadequate  or  absent  at  the  staging  facility,  the physician/FS will evaluate and order pain medication prior to continuation of PM.  (T-2) NOTE:    If  a  physician  is  not  present  and  pain  medication  is  not  available  or  is insufficient, request and establish contact with PMRC for a physician order. 8.21.4.3.  Non-drug interventions to assist in alleviating pain:  Maintain body alignment, elevate  extremity,  change  position;  readjust  splints  and  bivalved  casts;  encourage physical activity, if operationally and clinically feasible. Consider heat/cold application if not contraindicated. 8.21.4.4.  Prescribed  controlled  medications  entrusted to  a  patient/attendant  are considered  the  property  of  the  individual,  who  is  then  responsible  for  safeguarding  and administering  the  drug(s)  during  all  phases  of  PM.  Ensure  patients  understand  use  and have  an  adequate  supply  for  duration  of  movement  to  the  receiving  MTF.  Medical personnel will determine if the patient or attendant is competent to safely manage these medications.  (T-0)  NOTE:    Patients  and  NMA  will  not  carry  or  administer  controlled medications without a current written physician’s order. 8.21.4.5.  The  originating  facility  will  be  responsible  for  supplying  the  patient’s  pain medication for their time in the AE system. (T-2) Intratheater requires a 1-day supply and intertheater requires a 3-day supply of medication. (T-3) 8.21.5.  Epidurals and PNBs. 8.21.5.1.  Epidural analgesia and PNBs are a proven adjunct for severe pain management for  patients  transiting  the  continuum  of  care.  Patients  will  be  managed  by  ERCC  team, MAs,  and/or  AECMs  and  ERPS  personnel.  (T-2)  All  staging  facility  nursing  personnel and  AECMs  currently  providing  patient  care  in  the  AE  system  must  accomplish  the approved  AMC/SG  training  plan.  (T-2)  This  training  will  be  completed  annually  and within  90  days  of  deployment.  (T-1)This  training  will  be  documented  in  the  RN‘s Competency  Assessment  Folder  and  the  medical  technician/AET  Air  Force  Training Record.  (T-1)  The  CN  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  all  AECMs/staging  facility nursing  personnel  have  accomplished  training  prior  to  caring  for  patients  with  epidural analgesia  or  PNB  infusions.  (T-1)  The  training  can  be  local  AMC  SG/A3  website, https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/usafae/sg/SG%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx. 8.21.5.2.  The  following  apply  to  patients  moving  in  the  AE  system  without  an attendant/ERCC team: 8.21.5.2.1.  An  epidural  analgesia  or  PNB  infusion  must  be  in  place  and  running without incident for a minimum of 4 hrs. prior to departing the sending facility. (T-2) 8.21.5.2.2.  Only  analgesic  concentrations  of  local  anesthetics  will  be  infused.  (T-0) Narcotics (or any other medication) will NOT be added to the infusions. (T-0) 150 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.21.5.2.2.1.  Only amides such as bupivacaine and ropivacaine will be used. (T-0) Esters, such as procaine and chloroprocaine are not permitted due to increased risks associated with these medications. 8.21.5.2.2.2.  More  dilute  solutions,  i.e.  0.125%  Bupivacaine,  will  be  used  to decrease the risk of sympathetic blockade. (T-0) 8.21.5.2.3.  All infusions must be stable at an analgesic level, not a surgical anesthesia level,  at  the  T10  dermatome  (umbilicus)  level.  (T-0)  The  patient  should  be  able  to regain partial “motor” control of the lower extremities. (T-0) 8.21.5.2.4.  Other pain medications or narcotics may be administered orally, IV or by PCA using established protocols or in conjunction with written physician orders. 8.21.5.2.5.  All  epidural  analgesia  or  PNB  infusions  must  be  administered  using  an approved infusion pump. (T-2) Non-approved pumps will not be accepted without a waiver  from    AMC/A3VM.  (T-2)  The  pump  and  the  IV  tubing  must  clearly  be labeled  as  “EPIDURAL  INFUSION”  or  “PERIPHERAL  NERVE  BLOCK INFUSION.” (T-2) independently  verifying 8.21.5.2.6.  A  patient  hand-off  will  be  completed  and  documented  on  the  AF  Form 3899M or EHR equivalent each time a different clinician accepts care of the patient. (T-2) The hand-off will be performed consistently with high alert IV medications to prevent  programming  errors.  (T-2)  An  independent  double-check  is  defined  as  2 medical persons familiar with the process/equipment/medication (at least one being a RN), the  practitioner’s/provider’s  orders,  medication hanging,  and  the  correct  set  up  of  PCA  or  IV  pump  in  use  (rate,  dose,  volume  to infuse,  medication  concentration,  basal  rate,  bolus  lockout,  etc.).  This  hand-off  will include  clearing  the  infusion  history  on  the  infusion  pump.  (T-2)  Documentation  of double-checks will be reflected by two signatures on required forms/flow sheets or in the health record. (T-2) This is applicable to MTFs, ERPS, ERCC team, and AECMs. Double-checks are conducted and documented when initiating high alert medications, during hand-offs of care, following a change in orders, and when a new bag is started. 8.21.5.2.7.  Sufficient  orders  for  the  epidural  analgesia  or  regional  block  infusion must  be  fully  documented  in  the  health  record.  (T-2)  These  orders  should  include medication, infusion rates/settings as well as back-up pain management orders in the event the pump should fail or inadequate pain relief should occur while the patient is in transit. 8.21.5.2.8.  In  the  event  there  are  complications  related  to  the  epidural  infusion  or regional  block,  nursing  personnel  will  terminate  the  infusion  and  treat  patient  as appropriate and per established clinical guidelines included in the Epidural and PNB Training Plan established by  AMC/SGK.  (T-2)  Interventions could  include a range of activities from administering alternate pain adjuncts to airway/circulatory support. Changes  in  status  and  interventions  will  be  documented  in  the  health  record  and communicated to C2. (T-2) 8.21.5.2.9.  At  each  en  route  location,  an  anesthesia  provider  will  be  contacted,  if needed, for consultation. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 151 8.21.5.2.10.  Sterile dressings to insertion site will not be changed in the aircraft. (T-0) They may be reinforced if necessary. The epidural catheter will be secured so the catheter is not stretched or pulled at the site with any movement of the patient. (T-0) 8.21.5.3.  Patients  who  do  not  meet  the  above  criteria  must  be  assigned  a  medical attendant  who  is  appropriately  trained/credentialed  to  support  such  a  patient.  (T-0)  The PMR should also reflect type of infusion and attendant information. 8.21.5.4.  All  individuals  participating  in  the  care  of  the  patient  should  have  up-to-date training  and  experience  with  PCA  use,  regional  analgesia  and  the  equipment.  All equipment associated with the use of regional analgesia must be approved for flight. (T-2) Consider heat/cold application if not contraindicated. 8.21.5.5.  At  each  patient  care  hand  off  and  every  2  hrs.,  assess  pain  status,  MAAS sedation score, dermatome level of analgesia, VS, motor function, and drug side effects. AETs may assist in providing care to these patients in accordance with their Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). 8.21.5.6.  Assessing  motor/sensory  dermatome  levels  includes  motor  and  sensory function  checks.  NOTE:    a  dermatome  is  best  defined  as  that  area  of  the  skin  that  is supplied  by  a  single  spinal  nerve  or  more  specifically,  the  vertebral  level  at  which  the spinal nerve exits the spinal cord that innervates the skin in a contiguous sensory band or stripe  (~  1-2  inches  wide).  These  bands  arise  posteriorly,  from  the  spinal  column laterally/anteriorly.  Each  stripe  or  band  is  referred  to  as  a  dermatome  and  each dermatome corresponds to a specific nerve root. Dermatome segments are standardized to a  specific  nerve  root  and  enable  clear/consistent  communication  about  the  level  of anesthesia (sensory blockade). 8.21.5.6.1.  Assessing motor function: 8.21.5.6.1.1.  Ask patient to wiggle toes, dorsiflex foot. 8.21.5.6.1.2.  Ask patient to bend knees/raise leg. 8.21.5.6.1.3.  Tense the rectus muscles by lifting the head. 8.21.5.6.1.4.  See Figure 8.2. to determine the level of motor blockade. 152 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 Figure 8.2.  Dermatome Map.  8.21.5.6.1.4.1.

Assessing sensory function:  NOTE:  Positive findings indicate return of motor  function.  It  does  not,  however,  indicate  resolution  of  the  sensory/autonomic blockade therefore adequate pain control may still be present. 8.21.5.6.2.1.  Temperature - use a cold object (e.g. ice/alcohol swab). 8.21.5.6.2.2.  Touch - apply a sharp and dull object to the skin (e.g. paper clip). AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 153 8.21.5.6.2.3.  Begin  the  assessment  along  the  sternum  moving  from  side-to-side, progressing  downward  until  the  patient  identifies  a  'change'  in  ‘touch’  sensation and ‘temperature’ sensation (cold warmth or no sensation). Sensation levels may return faster on one side than the other, therefore clear documentation identifying the sensory levels (left and right) should be recorded. 8.21.5.7.  Peripheral nerve blocks. 8.21.5.7.1.  There  are  several  types  of  regional  anesthesia  currently  used  including axillary,  femoral,  and  popliteal  PNBs.  With  these  blocks,  the  anesthesia  provider injects  or  infuses  the  local  anesthetic  into  the  tissue  surrounding  the  nerve.  Needle placement  is  determined  initially  by  using  anatomic  landmarks.  Next,  a  peripheral nerve  stimulator  is  used  to  facilitate  precise  location  of  the  appropriate  nerve.  The anesthetic effect occurs primarily distal to the injection sites. For example, a popliteal block may be used for distal surgical procedures, such as the achilles tendon repair. In contrast,  intravenous  (Bier)  nerve  blocks  are  administered  distal  to  the  surgical  site and rely on diffusion rather than direct injection to achieve anesthetic effects. 8.21.5.7.2.  All local anesthetic agents used in PNBs induce physiologic responses via the  same  mechanism.  Specifically,  anesthetics the  neuronal membrane’s  permeability  to  sodium.  Disruption  of  sodium  exchange  results  in inhibition  of  neuronal  impulses  between  the  affected  extremity  and  the  brain. Consequently, sensory, motor, and sympathetic neural pathways are affected, and the patient is unable to feel or move the anesthetized limb. interfere  with 8.21.5.7.3.  Signs  of  systemic  toxicity  include  tinnitus,  sudden  metallic  taste, confusion that progresses rapidly to loss of consciousness, seizures, and abrupt onset of  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  Neurologic  symptoms  are  likely  to  appear  before cardiovascular  disturbances,  unless  epinephrine  (EPI)  has  been  added  to  the  block. Inadvertent systemic  administration  of  anesthetic  combinations  containing epinephrine will cause transient tachycardia and hypertension. Refer to  AE  Clinical Protocol - Local Anesthetic Toxicity (LAST) Treatment. 8.21.5.8.  Patient care responsibilities for epidural/PNB infusions. 8.21.5.8.1.  Ensure the patient  is  on  continuous pulse oximetry for  epidurals.  Assess and document the respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, MAAS sedation score, VS, pain scale, dermatome leve, motor and sensory function and side effects  (if present) every 2 hrs. Document this  on the AF Form 3899N, or EHR equivalent.  AETs may perform these duties in accordance with their CFETP. The AET will report these VS to  the  FN.  (T-3)    If  the  oxygen  saturation  falls  below  92%,  refer  to  AE  Clinical Protocol – Emergency Oxygen. 8.21.5.8.2.  Some motor weakness  in  patients  undergoing  epidural  analgesia or PNB therapy to  a lower extremity is expected and the patient should be considered a risk for falls and require assistance when ambulating. Identify the patient as a fall risk via the “Epidural Patient” or “PNB Patient” wrist band. 8.21.5.8.3.  Assess  the dressing for leakage every 4 hrs. and record on the AF Form 3899N or or EHR equivalent. 154 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.21.5.8.4.  Catheters  will  NOT  be  removed  until  reevaluated  by  an  anesthesia provider at the next scheduled en route stop. (T-2) Only the anesthesia provider will remove  the  catheter  if  required.  Staging  facility  personnel  and  AECMs  WILL NEVER  remove  the  catheter.  (T-2)  Administration  of  PRN  medications  per physician’s  orders  will  be  the  method  of  pain  management  if  the  approved  AE infusion pump must be turned off due to adverse side effects. (T-2) 8.21.5.8.5.  Caution  should  be  taken  with  any  patient  receiving  epidural  or  PNB analgesia via an indwelling catheter who is also receiving anticoagulation therapy, to include coumadin, heparin infusions, or low molecular weight heparin or lovenox. 8.21.5.8.6.  Maintain IV access of #20 gauge or larger. 8.21.5.8.7.  Change epidural/PNB medication bag before infusion runs out. 8.21.5.8.8.  Ensure  the  approved  AE  infusion  pump  and  IV  tubing  is  labeled “EPIDURAL ANALGESIA OR PERIPHERAL NERVE BLOCK” and the catheter is taped  with  label  indicating  "FOR  EPIDURAL  ANALGESIA  or  PERIPHERAL NERVE BLOCK USE ONLY." The MCD will ensure the patient’s placement on the aircraft  is  clearly  marked  on  the  load  plan  and  specifically  identify  the  patient’s location to the AE crew during pre-mission crew brief. (T-1) 8.21.5.8.9.  Adverse  effects  of  local  anesthetics  typically  occur  as  a  result  of  high blood  levels  of  the  drugs,  and  are  similar  among  all  agents  in  use.  Neurologic symptoms are likely to appear before cardiovascular disturbances, unless epinephrine has  been  added  to  the  block.    Inadvertent  systemic  administration  of  anesthetic combinations  containing  epinephrine  will  cause tachycardia  and hypertension. Hypersensitivity, or allergic reactions, although rare, are also a concern with regional anesthetic agents, and are more likely to occur with ester-based agents than  with  amides.  Esters tetracaine,  and piperocaine,  whereas  amides  include  bupivacaine,  mepivacaine,  and  prilocaine. WARNING:  If  adverse  side  effects  occur,  the  course  of  action  to  take  for  all problems related to these infusions during flight will be to terminate the infusion (turn off the approved AE infusion pump) and resort to other established pain management techniques. (T-2) include  procaine,  chloroprocaine, transient 8.21.5.8.10.  While  controversy  exists  regarding  the  mechanism  of  lipid  rescue,  the most  broadly  accepted  theory  is  that  Intralipid  creates  a  new  intravascular  lipid compartment,  or  “lipid  sink,”  that  increases  the  volume  distribution  of  lipophillic drugs. Distribution of drugs to this additional lipid compartment rapidly decreases the concentration of overdosed medicines on vital organs and quickly reverses the effects of the toxins. Thus far, lipid rescue has been proven to work in anesthetic overdoses such  as  bupivacaine  and  lidocaine  (commonly  used  emergency  department  [ED] anesthetics).

(T-2) 8.21.5.8.14.  Epidural  analgesia  therapy  and  PNB  therapy  to  a  lower  extremity  can cause motor weakness and is normal; therefore, the patient requires assistance with all activities.  The  staging  facility  nurses  and  flight  nurses  will  be  responsible  for assessing the patient’s motor strength. (T-1) If a patient cannot move their legs due to excessive motor block from the infusion, notify the TVFS immediately. (T-2) 8.21.5.8.15.  If the patient has a MAAS score of less than 2 or greater than 4, consider other causes like hypoxia, pain, and the need to use the restroom, etc. and call the C2 agency. Table 8.10. Table 8.10.

Ensuring  every  patient  has  an  ample  medication  supply  to  meet  their  individual requirements  throughout  the  patient  movement  system  is  the  responsibility  of  every  care provider  at  every  hand-off  location.  Variables  such  as  the  patient's  inpatient  or  outpatient status,  the  geographic  location,  and  the  capability  of  the  originating  and  final  destination MTF, along with  patient  safety, must be considered when determining the required  amount of  medications.  (T-2)  The  general  intent  is  to  minimize  the  logistical  demand  on  deployed locations  while  meeting  medication  requirements  for  all  patients  en  route  to  their  final destination MTF and/or follow-up outpatient appointment. 8.22.2.  Providers must use electronic order entry for prescriptions whenever available, IAW AFI  44-102,  Medical  Care  Management.  (T-1)  If  not  using  electronic  order  entry,  use  AF Form  781,  Multiple  Item  Prescription,  or  equivalent  computer-generated  means  via  an  AF approved system. 8.22.3.  Inpatients  should  receive  controlled  substance  medications  from  the  IFK  or  patient staging narcotics, when available. MTF’s will send those medications not maintained in the in-flight kit. (T-2) MTFs should not send a supply of those medications available in the IFK with the patient. (T-2)  If the inpatient will be traveling via CAA, MTFs will check with the AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 159 PMRC  arranging  transport  to  determine  what  medications  will  need  to  accompany  the patient.

Staging  Facility  patient  care  providers  and  AECMs  are  responsible  for  the accounting  and  administration  of  all  controlled  and  non-controlled  medications prescribed to inpatients. 8.22.4.  Self-administration of medications (SAM) patients. 8.22.4.1.  An  outpatient  may  carry  their  own  supply  of  controlled  substances,  if determined  by  the  sending  provider  to  be  competent  to  self-medicate  and  when designated by the clearing FS. NOTE:  Outpatient mental health patients (5C) will only be  cleared  to  self-medicate  after  consultation  by  a  provider  licensed  or  credentialed  in Mental Health. (T-2) 8.22.4.2.  When a patient is allowed to self-administer his/her own medications, AECMs do  not  have  to  count  them  and  those  medications  should  remain  under  the  patient’s control.  Medications  are  prescribed,  dispensed,  and  accounted  for  by  the  dispensing pharmacy. 8.22.4.3.  Qualified  health  care  providers  will  counsel  the  patient  with  instruction  and information  regarding  their  prescribed  medication.  (T-2)  Education  will be  documented in the health record. (T-2) 8.22.4.4.  Patients  who  self-administer  will  ensure  their  medications  are  not  stored/kept where other individuals have access to them and they will not leave them in their checked bags. (T-2) 8.22.4.5.  Prior  to  flight,  a  RN  must  personally  interact  with  the  patient  to  verify  the patient’s understanding and knowledge, and provide additional education, as appropriate, on proper SAM. (T-2) This process begins with the ERPS/MTF and continues throughout the AE system. 8.22.4.6.  Healthcare  professionals  should  remain  cognizant  of  potential  abuse  and misuse  of  controlled  medications  and  follow  this  guidance  as  applicable.  Outpatients deemed  compliant  and  competent  to  self-medicate  may  carry  and  administer  their  own supply  of  controlled  and  non-controlled  medications  if  the  following  is  clearly documented on the AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent. (T-2) 8.22.4.6.1.  Provider’s order for “SAM.” 8.22.4.6.2.  “Will  self-medicate”  boxes  must  be  marked  on  the  front  and  reverse  of the AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent. (T-2) 8.22.4.6.3.  The  following  statement  written  and  signed  by  the  verifying  provider  or nurse stating that the patient is compliant and competent to self-medicate:  “Patient is hand-carrying  medication(s);  has  been  instructed  on  self-administration  of  (list medication name[s]) and verbalizes understanding.” 8.22.4.6.4.  At  a  minimum,  SAM  patients  will  be  reassessed  at  every  hand-off  for continued competency and compliance. (T-2) 160 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.22.4.7.  If an outpatient is deemed not compliant and/or not competent to SAM at any point  of  the  patient  movement  process,  the  respective  care  provider  (e.g.  MCD,  FN, ERPS personnel) will:  (T-2) 8.22.4.7.1.  Immediately assume responsibility for and administration of that patient’s medication(s). (T-2) 8.22.4.7.2.  Clearly document the change in the patient’s SAM status on the AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent. (T-2) 8.22.4.7.3.  Verbally communicate changes in status to the accepting care provider at the next patient hand-off. (T-2) 8.22.4.7.4.  Initiate  a  DD  Form  2852  and  submit representative. (T-2) to  AMC  Patient  Safety 8.22.4.8.  MTFs  at  en  route  stops  will  refill  the  controlled  substance  as  required  for onward movement. (T-2) This will reduce excessive quantities of controlled medications being moved through the PM system. All  medication will be appropriately labeled with the patient’s name and directions for administration by the sending facility. (T-2) 8.22.4.9.  Deployed locations should send a 1-day supply for all patients moving from a role  2  to  a  role  3  facility  in  the  combat  operations  theater  and  a  2-day  supply  for  all patients moving from the role 3 to the role 4 medical center. Refer to Joint Publication 4-02 Health Service Support. 8.22.5.  Medication quantities required for PM. 8.22.5.1.  Outside the continental United States (OCONUS) to CONUS PM. 8.22.5.1.1.  Inpatients  moving  directly  from  an  OCONUS  MTF  to  port  of  entry accepting  MTF/Final  Destination  require  a  2-day  supply  (e.g.  Landstuhl  Regional Medical Center [LRMC]) to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. 8.22.5.1.2.  Inpatients moving from an OCONUS MTF to port of entry ERPS, RON and  then  move  on  to  accepting  MTF/Final  Destination  require  a  3-day  supply  (e.g. LRMC to Andrews ERPS to Fort Benning). 8.22.5.1.3.  All outpatients require a 5-day supply. 8.22.5.2.  CONUS  to  CONUS.    The  majority  of  CONUS  to  CONUS  moves  are completed in an 8-12 hr. time frame; therefore a 1-day supply of medication is adequate. 8.22.5.3.  CONUS  to  OCONUS.  Inpatients  follow  Section  8.22.5.1.,  and  outpatients follow  Section  8.22.5.1.3.  Variations  to  this  policy  regarding  amount  and  type  of medication  to  be  sent  with  outpatients  are  authorized  only  if  transportation  is  arranged using an alternate mode of travel such as commercial air, rail or ground movement based on anticipated length of travel. IAW DoDI 6000.11, documentation in TRAC2ES for all PM greater than 100 miles is mandatory, regardless of conveyance. 8.22.6.  Administration of medication. 8.22.6.1.  General information. Administer medications in-flight on the same schedule as in  the  originating  MTF,  or  as  near  as  possible.  The  goal  of  administering  any  type  of AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 161 medication or treatment in the AE system is to  maintain the continuity of care from the originating MTF to the destination MTF without significant delays. 8.22.6.2.  Prior to departing the ERPS or MTF, the patient will be assessed for pain and given  pain  medications  needed  within  1  hr.  of  departure.  (T-2)  If  required,  administer other  medications  within  1  hr.  of  departure.  Consider  adjusting  dosing  schedule  for diuretics to ensure patient restroom access. 8.22.6.3.  Administration of medication according to established protocols.  In emergency situations, the AECM initiates care based on individual competency, level of knowledge and  skill.  Refer  to  the  Nursing  Drug  Handbook  in  the  in-flight  kit  and  follow  refer  to current AHA ACLS guidelines for cardiac arrest. 8.22.6.4.  4N0s/X4N0s  trained  IAW  the  AFMS  medication  administration  program  will be allowed to administer medications IAW with the most current work center authorized drug list. (T-1) The AE authorized drug list is the allowance standard. Applicable areas of CFETP  will  be  signed  off,  to  include,  routes  of  administration  and  schedule  of medications commensurate with skill level. (T-1) 8.22.6.5.  AETs will not be team  lead or fill  the FN position on cardiac  arrest  or ACLS emergencies, regardless of level of certification held. (T-0) 8.22.6.6.  Controlled medications. 8.22.6.6.1.  A  controlled  drug  accepted  by  the  healthcare  provider  becomes  his/her responsibility  for  accountability,  control,  safeguarding,  and  disposition.  Nurses  are responsible  for  daily/mission  accountability  of  patient  narcotics  on  each  applicable AF  Form  3899  or  EHR  equivalent.  Annotate  drug  and  number  available  on  the  AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent during patient hand-off. WARNING:  enlisted ground personnel may only take control of Schedule II through V medications after they have been  trained  and  certified  by  someone  appointed  by  the  MTF  or  equivalent commander IAW the CFETP. 8.22.6.6.2.  If  controlled  medication  is  stored  at  a  remote  location  other  than  a pharmacy  (e.g.  a  nurse’s  station),  a  nurse  and  another  qualified  person  must  count them at change of shift or the beginning/end of every mission and when accessed for patient  use  and  document  on  AF  IMT  579,  Controlled  Substances  Register,  or  in automated equipment logs (e.g. Pyxis ® log), as appropriate. (T-1) This form will be included in the narcotics box for all controlled medications. (T-2) 8.22.6.6.3.  When  controlled  medications  are  brought  onboard  the  aircraft,  the MCD/FN and MTF representative together will complete an inventory. (T-2) 8.22.6.6.3.1.  The name  and quantity of medications are noted and signed for on the AF Form 3899A, (Front). (T-2) 8.22.6.6.3.2.  If these medications are returned to the MTF, the representative and FN  must  annotate  the  AF  Form  3899A  or  EHR  equivalent  with  the  statement “Refused and Returned,” and both persons sign the form. (T-2) 8.22.6.6.4.  During RONs, controlled medications will be secured at all times and are the responsibility of the FNs when a DoD MTF is not located at the RON site. (T-2) 162 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.22.6.6.5.  All controlled medications, not in the IFK, will accompany the patient to the destination MTF. (T-2) 8.22.6.6.6.  Upon  termination  of  the  mission,  all  unaccompanied/unserviceable controlled  medications  are  documented  on  the  AF  Form  3859,  Turn-In  of Unaccompanied  Narcotics,  and  turned  into  the  medication  room  for  disposition  per local policy and annotate AF Form 3829. (T-2) NOTE:  If controlled medications are off loaded at the incorrect MTF, notify C2 for immediate tracking. (T-2) 8.22.6.6.7.  Controlled  medications  missing/unaccounted execution. for  during  mission 8.22.6.6.7.1.  As  soon  as  the  FN  realizes  controlled  medications  are  missing, report the loss immediately to the PIC. 8.22.6.6.7.2.  As  soon  as  possible,  the  FN  creates  a  memorandum  for  record  or affidavit documenting the circumstances surrounding the loss, type, and quantities of  medications  missing.  If  possible,  obtain  written  statements  or  affidavits  from any persons having knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the loss. This is submitted to the chief nurse for review. 8.22.6.6.7.3.  Contact  C2  as  soon  as  possible  and  prior  to  landing  at  the  next  en route stop or final destination. (T-2) 8.22.6.6.7.4.  C2,  in  consultation  with  the  governing  PMRC,  should  notify  the Office of Special Investigations or the security police to ensure appropriate steps are taken upon landing. (T-2) 8.22.6.6.7.5.  If the medications are still not located, the investigating agency will dictate follow on actions. A DD Form 2852 will also be completed. (T-1) 8.22.7.  Anaphylaxis. Refer to AE Clinical Protocol – Anaphylactic Reaction. 8.22.7.1.  Anaphylaxis  is  a  severe,  systemic,  allergic  reaction  involving  the  respiratory and/or  cardiovascular  system.  It  is  an  immediate,  life-threatening  reaction  caused  by injection, ingestion, inhalation, insect stings or bites. It usually occurs within 30 minutes of exposure but may take up to 2 hours to develop. 8.22.7.2.  Signs  and  symptoms  may  occur  within  minutes  of  exposure  to  allergen  and may  include  flushing  of  the  skin,  itching,  hives,  edema  (primarily  of  face,  tongue, laryngeal),  bronchospasm,  cough,  wheezing, retractions, hypotension,  tachycardia,  arrhythmia,  palpitations,  pallor,  dizziness,  syncope,  anxiety, lethargy, sudden loss of consciousness, seizures, and coma. stridorous  breathing, 8.22.7.3.

(T-0)  The following statement will be documented on AF Form 3899 “(Insert name of drug) was administered IAW AE  Clinical Protocol  –  Anaphylactic Reaction. Complete and submit DD Form 2852. (T-0) 8.22.7.4.  Performance  improvement  monitoring  using  the  patient’s  medical  record  will include:    the  anaphylactic  reaction  is  identified  and  treated  within  the  parameters  of  AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 163 current  AE  Clinical  Protocol  –  Anaphylactic  Reaction,  documentation  of  notification  to the VFS and AOC/AECT agency; documentation of the event, intervention, and outcome on  patients  AF  Form  3899  or  EHR  equivalent  and  completion  of  the    DD  Form  2852.   (T-2) 8.22.8.  Documentation. 8.22.8.1.  All patients will have an up-to-date medication administration record (MAR) to ensure  accurate  and  timely  medication  administration  is  conveyed  and  documented throughout the continuum of care. (T-2) 8.22.8.2.  Every effort will be made to ensure the MAR, as well as the electronic forms in the TRAC2ES, are in agreement. (T-2) Exception:  Outpatients traveling via commercial air  do  not  need  a  MAR.  However,  all  medications  ordered  for  and  carried  by  the outpatient must be documented in TRAC2ES. (T-2) 8.22.8.3.  The  sending  MTF  or  staging  facility  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  MAR  is completed and sent with the patient. 8.22.8.4.  En  route  MAR  documentation  will  be  completed  at  the  MTF,  ERPS,  and  in-flight.    (T-2) Any changes must be updated on the MAR and annotated in TRAC2ES by the  clinician  initiating  the  change  utilizing  the  electronic  AF  Form  3899A  within TRAC2ES. (T-2) If changes occur in-flight or at an en route staging or RON facility, the PMCC will be notified to update the AF Form 3899A in TRAC2ES. (T-2) 8.22.9.  OTC medication administration. 8.22.9.1.  NOTE  : This AFI provides the registered nurse with the ability to administer OTC medication to  patients,  without notifying a  physician in  advance.  The medication will be documented on the AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent and the DD Form 2852 (T-2); Patient Movement Event/Near Miss Report. In emergency situations, the RN initiates care based on individual competency, level of knowledge and skill.  Refer to the current edition of the Nursing Drug Handbook or Physicians’ Desk Reference. Medications may be administered one time, unless otherwise stated, by a trained and competent RN. Once treatment flight  surgeon  and AOC/AECT/PMRC for further physician orders.

Documentation of the medication administered on the AF Form 3899I or EHR equivalent. 8.22.9.2.6.  Completion of the DD Form 2852. (T-2) 8.22.10.  High alert medications. 8.22.10.1.  High alert medications have a heightened risk of causing patient harm if they are  used  in  error.  The  Institute  for  Safe  Medication  Practices  provides  a  listing  of  high alert  medications.  The  more  common  high  alert  medication  in  the  AE  system  includes (but  not  limited  to):    IV  narcotics/opiates,  IV  anticoagulants,  total  parenteral  nutrition, and all epidurals and PNBs. 8.22.10.2.  Conduct  and  document  independent  double-checks  with  all  high-alert  IV medications,  all  PCA’s,  epidurals,  and  PNBs.  Documentation  of  double-checks  will  be reflected by 2 signatures on required forms/flow sheets. (T-2) This is applicable to ERPS, ERCC team and AECMs.    NOTE:  Documenting “Checked with (other clinicians)” in an EHR current field is adequate. 8.22.10.2.1.  An  independent  double-check  is  defined  as  two  authorized  medical persons  familiar  with  the  process/equipment/medication  (at  least  one  being  a  RN), independently verifying the practitioner’s/provider’s orders, medication hanging, and the correct set up of PCA or IV pump in use (rate, dose, volume to infuse, medication concentration, basal rate, bolus lockout, etc.). 8.22.10.2.2.  Double-checks are conducted and documented when initiating high alert medications, during hand-offs of care, following a change in orders, and when a new bag is started. 8.22.11.  Unconscious/Difficult to Arouse Patients 8.22.11.1.  Various  factors  may  lead  to  an  unconscious/difficult  to  arouse  patient  in  the AE  environment.    Opiate/narcotic  or  sedating  medication  overdose  will  produce inadequate ventilation/respiration and an altered mental status. For unconscious/difficult to  arouse  patients,  due  to  a  suspected  narcotic  or  benzodiazepine  overdose,  refer  to  the AE  Clinical  Protocol  -  Narcotic  or  Benzodiazepine.  Otherwise,  provide  basic  life support and immediately contact C2/VFS for guidance. 8.22.11.2.  For  all  unconscious/known  or  suspected  narcotic  overdose  notify  the validating  flight  surgeon  and  AOC/AECT  for  guidance,  treatment  options  and  possible diversion.  (T-2) 8.22.11.3.  Signs and symptoms of a narcotic overdose. 8.22.11.4.  Mental status changes. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 165 8.22.11.5.  Hypotension/hypertension. 8.22.11.6.  Decreased or absent respiratory rate or tachycardia. 8.22.11.7.  Pinpoint  pupils,  and  seizures.   Normal  pupil  examination  does  NOT  exclude opioid  intoxication.  Users  of  meperidine  and  propoxyphene  may  present  with  normal pupils. The presence of coingestants (such as sympathomimetics or anticholinergics) may make pupils appear normal or large. 8.22.11.8.  If  on  a  PCA  (regional  or  epidural  pump)  and  patient  suddenly  becomes difficult to arouse; turn pump off and continue BLS management. 8.22.11.9.  Do  not  rely  on  patient  history  of  ingestion,  especially  in  patients  with psychiatric history. 8.22.11.10.  Make sure patient is not still carrying other medications or has any weapons. 8.22.11.11.  Symptoms of opioid withdrawal can include nausea/vomiting, hyperactivity, increased pain, and combativeness. 8.22.11.12.  Documentation  will  include  subjective  and  objective  data  for  giving  the medication; VS, if indicated, known allergies; for women of childbearing years: date of last menstrual cycle, date and time of administration and notification of a physician, and the  outcome.  (T-0)  The  following  statement  will  be  documented  on  AF  Form  3899  or EHR  equivalent  “(Insert  name  of  drug)  was  administered  IAW  AE  Clinical  Protocol  - Narcotic or Benzodiazepine Overdose.” Complete and submit DD Form 2852. (T-2) 8.22.11.13.  Performance Improvement Monitoring. 8.22.11.13.1.  A  narcotic  overdose  is  identified  and  treated  within  the  parameters  of this AE Clinical Protocol. 8.22.11.13.2.  Documentation of notification to the VFS and AOC/AECT agency. 8.22.11.13.3.  Document event, intervention and  outcome on patients AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent. 8.22.11.13.4.  Completion of the DD Form 2852. (T-2) 8.23.  IV Therapy. 8.23.1.  Stresses of flight. 8.23.1.1.  Barometric  pressure  changes:    Air  expansion  at  altitude  may  cause  some  IV rates to fluctuate. 8.23.1.2.  Situations  potentially  dangerous  to  a  patient  are  a  sudden  surge  of  fluid, unregulated flow to the patient, and air bubbles in the administration tubing. 8.23.1.3.  Critical area of consideration:  Accurate administration of IV therapy poses one of the greatest concerns in-flight. If the IV is not regulated by the use of an IV infusion pump, drip rates will be reevaluated once cruise altitude is reached, frequently throughout the flight, after descent, and after a rapid decompression. (T-0)  NOTE:  “Dial-a-flows” will not be used to regulate IV rates in-flight. (T-0) 8.23.2.  IV containers. 166 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.23.2.1.  Plastic IV containers:  Plastic solution containers are preferred for in-flight use because  they  are  easy  to  handle  and  secure,  do  not  break,  and  expand/contract  with changes in barometric pressure without venting. 8.23.2.2.  Glass IV containers:  IV glass bottles without integral venting rods do not allow for the escape of expanding air. The expansion of air will force the fluid out of the bottle or the IV will not drip at all. NOTE:  Do not use glass bottles without venting them. 8.23.2.3.  Venting procedures:  Any rigid plastic or glass IV bottle requires venting. 8.23.2.3.1.  Insert  an  18-gauge  needle  through  the  bottle  cap  into  the  lumen  of  the integral air rod of the bottle. 8.23.2.3.2.  Remove the cap from the air vent on the drip set and insert a sterile 3 ml syringe into the vent. 8.23.2.3.3.  Secure  the  syringe  and  plunger  into  the  vent  by  running  a  strip  of  tape over the plunger of the syringe and around the neck of the IV bottle. As the air of the bottle expands it leaves via the needle inserted into the air rod; the syringe acts as a plug, held in place by the tape, and prevents fluid from pouring out of the bottle. 8.23.2.3.4.  Non-vented drip sets:  When non-vented drip sets are used, it is necessary to insert a needle only into the integral air rod of the IV bottle. 8.23.2.3.5.  Volutrol  (metered  drip  sets  constructed  of  pliable  plastic):    The  meter chamber  is  filled  and  clamped  off  between  the  bottle  and  the  chamber.  (Since  the meter chamber collapses as it empties, air does not enter or expand in the chamber.) 8.23.2.3.6.  Metered drip sets  constructed of rigid plastic:  Systems  with  air vents  in the metering section of the drip set allow air in the tubing during rapid decompression and will not be used. 8.23.3.  IV therapy:  Preflight/in-flight considerations. 8.23.3.1.  Document the IV start time, site, catheter gauge, and the last dressing change, if known. 8.23.3.2.  Label  IV bag  with  solution,  date, start and stop  times  and initials.  Do not  use markers because they are absorbed into the plastic bag. 8.23.3.3.  Infusion  pumps  will  be  used  for  heparin,  cardiac  and  vasoactive  medications, neonatal/ pediatric patients, and TPN. (T-1) Refer to AFI 10-2909. 8.23.3.4.  Ensure line is patent. 8.23.3.5.  Assess  insertion  site  and  evaluate  for  infection/irritation:    Redness/red  streaks at insertion site, warmth, edema, purulence/drainage, and pain. 8.23.3.6.  Ensure  patient  has  enough  IVs,  medications,  and  supplies  to  reach  the destination facility. 8.23.3.6.1.  When  patient  medical  supplies  and  PMI  are  coordinated  with  the  AE system in advance, most items will be provided from the AE staging base. (T-2) 8.23.3.6.2.  Without advance coordination, the originating facility will be responsible for providing these items and should provide a 1-day minimum of supplies, except for AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 167 patient  movement  from  theater  to  CONUS  and  within  CONUS  where  a  3-day minimum should be provided. (T-3) 8.23.3.7.  Place  patients  receiving  IV  therapy  in  the  middle  to  low  tier  to  facilitate  IV flow, if possible (if the IV is not managed with an IV infusion pump). 8.23.3.8.  After  a  rapid  decompression,  the  following  difficulties  may  be  encountered:  Bags/bottles break, drip  sets  pop out,  blood  backs up into tubing, and excessive air  and fluid is forced into patient. 8.23.3.9.  AECM actions following a rapid decompression:  Clamp tubing, check infusion site,  bottle  or  bag,  infusion  pump  (if  applicable),  and  tubing.  Assess  for  signs  and symptoms  of  infiltration.  Clear  the  tubing  of  air  and  resume  infusion  if  not  clotted  or infiltrated. 8.24.  Management/Administration of Blood and Blood Products  . 8.24.1.  All blood products carried in the AE system will be transported as rapidly as possible at  the  appropriate  temperature,  in  standard  blood  shipping  boxes  consisting  of  an  outer cardboard  box  with  a  Styrofoam  insert.  Blood  temperature  during  transport  needs  to  be maintained  between  1-10  degrees  C  for  liquid  RBCs.  Fresh  frozen  plasma  and  frozen cryoprecipitate  must  maintain  frozen  state  (it  is  usually  shipped  in  dry  ice).  NOTE:    The blood  product  may  be  in  aircraft  refrigerators,  if  maintained  in  the  blood  shipment  box,  to prevent the ice from thawing as fast. NOTE:  AE usually does not transport blood shipments which is handled through class VIII B channels. 8.24.2.  Blood  shipping  containers  will  not  be  exposed  to  extreme  temperatures  (below  1 degree C or over 27 degrees C).

NOTE:  Check bag label for expiration date and satisfactory serologic testing. 8.24.4.6.  Document  on  transfusion  record  names  of  persons  starting  the  infusion  and stopping infusions. 8.24.4.7.  Utilize  blood  transfusion  tubing  and  filter  as  prescribed.  Prior  to  initiation  of blood  product  take a full set  of VS to  include temperature. No medications or solutions should be added to or transfused concurrently with blood components except NS. 8.24.4.8.  The  total  volume  infused  must  be  documented  on  available  intake  and  output record. (T-2) 8.24.4.9.  Start infusion slowly (i.e. 2 ml/minute). Note the time from the time the blood begins infusing at the IV port site. Remain with the patient for 15 minutes and assess vital signs  IAW  paragraph  8.24.5.4.1.    NOTE:    Currently  there  are  no  blood  warmers approved for use in the AE environment. 8.24.4.10.  Reassess  patient  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  transfusion  reaction  (i.e.  acute hemolytic,  anaphylactic)  at  least  hourly.  NOTE:    Transfusion  reactions  usually  occur within the first 50-100 ml. 8.24.4.11.  Acute reactions can occur at any time during the transfusions. 8.24.4.12.  Documentation  of  assessment  is  required.  NOTE:    For  all  blood  component infusions, it is imperative that the patient be closely monitored for acute reactions. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 169 8.24.4.13.  Whole  blood,  RBC,  and  fresh  frozen  plasma  (FFP)  will  be  hung  within  30 minutes of removal from the blood-shipping container. (T-0) 8.24.4.14.

The infusion may be completed within 15 to 30 minutes depending on total volume. 8.24.4.16.  Cryoprecipitate, once thawed, must be infused immediately. (T-0) Run over 3 - 15 minutes. 8.24.4.17.  Platelets  may  be  transported  at  room  temperature  between  20-24o  C  or  68  -75.2o  F.  The  transfusion  may  be  completed  within  20-60  minutes  depending  on  total volume. 8.24.4.18.  Blood  and  blood  components  may  be  administered  during  emergent contingency and wartime ground and in-flight operations, and consent for transfusion is implied. 8.24.5.  Blood  transfusion  reactions.  Unexpected  complications  can  occur  in  any  blood transfusion recipient. These adverse reactions can be categorized as immunologic, infectious, chemical,  and  physical,  and  some  are  further  subdivided  into  acute  and  delayed  reactions. The most clinically important adverse effects of transfusion are infectious or immunological occurrences. Stringent screening requirements have drastically reduced the risk of transfusion acquired pathogens such as Hepatitis B, HIV and Hepatitis C thereby resulting  in a marked reduction in infectious related reactions. Additionally, infectious complications and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions generally manifest themselves 3-7 days post transfusion and therefore are outside of the scope of this AE Clinical Protocol. 8.24.5.1.  The  classic  transfusion  reactions  are  immunologic  in  nature.  Acute  reactions occur in 1% to 2% of transfused patients. Severe transfusion reactions are most likely to occur during the first 15 minutes of infusion. Therefore, to facilitate early recognition of potentially  life-threatening  complications,  patients  should  be  monitored  closely  upon initiation of any blood transfusion product. Examples of classic immunologic transfusion reactions include febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR); acute hemolytic transfusion  reaction  (AHTR)  and  allergic  reactions  (urticarial  and  anaphylactic  allergic reactions). Refer to AE Clinical Protocol - Reaction to Blood Products. 8.24.5.2.  For  all  known  or  suspected  blood  transfusion  reactions  notify  the  validating flight surgeon and AOC/AECT for guidance and possible diversion to a MTF capable of handling the situation. 8.24.5.3.  Documentation of any blood product reaction includes subjective and objective data for giving medication; VS, known allergies, women of child bearing years: date of last menstrual cycle; date and time of administration and notification of a physician, and the  outcome.  (T-0)  The  following  statement  will  be  documented  on  AF  Form  3899  or EHR  equivalent  “(Insert  name  of  drug)  was  administered  IAW  AE  Clinical  Protocol  - Reaction to Blood Products.” Complete DD Form 2852. (T-2) 8.24.5.4.  Process improvement monitoring includes: 170 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.24.5.4.1.  Documentation of VS.  Baseline vital signs will be documented within 30 minutes of start of transfusion; 15 minutes after start of transfusion and then every 60 minutes until transfusion is complete.  Post transfusion vitals will be documented 60 minutes after transfusion is complete. 8.24.5.4.2.  Document any reaction on the AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent. 8.24.5.4.3.  Document any medication administration on the AF Form 3899I or EHR equivalent and completion of the DD Form 2852. (T-2) 8.25.  Infection Control. 8.25.1.  Infection  control  can  be  difficult  in  the  dynamic  physical  environment  of  AE. Therefore,  originating  physicians  should  remain  vigilant  for  the  presence  of  communicable diseases that could spread to other patients, the crew, or the destination MTF community. 8.25.2.  General principles of infection control. 8.25.2.1.  The  guidelines  for  personnel  and  recommended  standards  of  patient  care  are contained in the most current Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and in local cleaning  directives.  Enhance  local  protocols  by  monitoring  the  CDC’s  website  at http://www.cdc.gov/nciDoD/dhqp/index.html. 8.25.2.2.  All  medical  personnel  in  the  AE  environment  will  implement  Standard Precautions with all patients coupled with Transmission Based Precautions and will keep aircrews informed, as required. (T-0) AFMAN 44-156, Treatment of Biological Warfare Agent Casualties, is available for additional guidance. (T-1) 8.25.2.3.  Brief  all  infectious  patients  and  their  attendants  on  isolation  procedures  and precautions. 8.25.2.4.  Each aircraft and mission is unique. Environmental lighting in most cases will be poor, making the visualization of blood and body fluids highly uncertain. The practice of infection control within the AE setting will adhere to the following principles: 8.25.2.4.1.  The aircraft is considered a dirty environment. Normally dressings will be reinforced unless there is evidence of significant blood loss. (T-2) 8.25.2.4.2.  Medical  personnel  with  “actively”  exudative lesions  or  weeping dermatitis should not be scheduled for mission until resolved/cleared by FS. (T-2)  If excess  drainage  occurs  during  flight,  bandage  the  wound  area  and  limit  patient  care until seen by FS. (T-2) 8.25.2.4.3.  Fingernails  must  comply  with  AFI  44-108,  Infection  Prevention  and Control Program.  (T-1) 8.25.2.4.4.  NOMEX/leather gloves will not be worn while administering patient care. (T-0) 8.25.2.4.5.  Eating,  drinking,  applying  cosmetics,  and  handling  contact  lenses  is prohibited  in  work  areas  where  there  is  a  likelihood  of  exposure  to  blood  and  body fluids (BBF). (T-0) 8.25.2.4.6.  Food  and  drinks  are  prohibited  on  countertops  where  blood  and  other potentially infected material are stored or placed. (T-0) Exception:  On cargo aircraft AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 171 this  may  not  be  feasible.  Ensure  the  loadmaster/boom  operator  is  notified  of  the storage/placement of such items, in order that they may disseminate the information to the rest of the crew. 8.25.2.5.  Patient  assignment  and  placement  of  patients.  NOTE:    The  airflow  of  each aircraft  will  govern  litter  and  seat  assignments  for  high  risk  immune  compromised patients or patients on airborne or droplet precautions.  (T-0) Refer to Attachment 14. 8.25.2.5.1.  High-risk  patients  (e.g.  those  particularly  susceptible  to  infection:  leukemia,  cancer  and  post-op  patients)  must  be  located  as  far  as  possible  from infectious  patients.  (T-0)    All  efforts  should  be  made  to  limit  the  number  of  care givers  to  either  highly  infectious  or  neutrophilic  patient  populations.  Consider  the direction  of  airflow  in  the  aircraft  and  having  the  high-risk  patient  wear  the  N-95 mask en route. 8.25.2.5.2.  Known  or  suspected  infectious  patients  should  be  in  the  lowest  litter position. 8.25.2.5.3.  When feasible, assign a single caregiver to infectious patients or to those who are at high-risk for infection. Avoid mixing infectious patients and those at high-risk for infection, whenever possible. 8.25.2.5.4.  Patients with known or suspected wound infections should not be placed in the same area as patients with clean wounds. 8.25.2.5.5.  Infectious ambulatory patients will be seated away from other  patients if possible.  (T-0) 8.25.2.5.6.  In  the  event  there  are  patients  who  have  active  infections  with  the  same disease (e.g., TB, measles, tularemia, cholera, etc.), they may be moved as groups or cohorted  in  another  area  of  the  aircraft  that  meets  safe  ventilation  and  airflow requirements for Airborne Precautions. 8.25.2.5.7.  In austere  ground operation settings  with  limited airflow (e.g., AMBUS, Humvee,  tentage),  the  infectious  patient  will  wear  a  N95  mask,  if  applicable.  (T-1) The patient will be placed to the greatest extent possible downwind, near the airflow exit and away from  other patients.  (T-0)  NOTE:   When in  confined areas and/or in areas  with  poor  air  circulation,  both  the  patient  and  the  health  care  worker  (HCW) will wear a N95 mask. (T-1) 8.25.3.  Standard precautions. 8.25.3.1.  Handwashing. 8.25.3.1.1.  Handwashing  is  the  single  most  important  method  for  preventing  the spread of infection. 8.25.3.1.2.  Handwashing  will  be  accomplished  with  soap  and  running  water,  if available. (T-0) 8.25.3.1.3.  AE  approved  waterless  hand  cleaners/antiseptics  may  be  used  as  an adjunct  to  routine  hand  washing  or  when  hand  washing  facilities  are  inadequate, inaccessible,  or  when  there  is  an  interruption  in  the  water  supply.  Waterless  hand antiseptics may come in a foam, gel, or towelette. NOTE:  If visible soiling is present 172 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 on the hands, a towelette will offer the physical removal of the dirt and should be the first choice for hand antisepsis. (T-0) Follow manufacturer’s directions for use. (T-0) NOTE:    Waterless  hand  cleaners/antiseptics  are  not  effective  against  all  organisms (e.g. C. Difficile) 8.25.3.1.4.  Wash hands or use hand antiseptic before and after each patient contact; immediately  after  removing  gloves  or  other  personal  protective  attire  (e.g.  gowns, masks,  goggles);  before  dispensing  medications,  performing  invasive  procedures, touching wounds or touching patients who are susceptible to infection; before serving meals; and after sneezing, coughing, eating, and performing personal hygiene. 8.25.3.2.

Wash hands immediately after removing gloves. 8.25.3.2.2.  Gowns. 8.25.3.2.2.1.  Fluid-repellent  gowns  are  worn  to  protect  skin  and  prevent  soiling of  clothing  during  procedures  and  patient  care  activities  likely  to  generate splashes or sprays of BBF.  In the event  the HCW clothing is  contaminated with BBF, a gown may be worn for a short duration to prevent cross-contamination. 8.25.3.2.2.2.  Promptly  discard  BBF  contaminated  disposable  gowns  after  use  in designated biohazard trash bags. 8.25.3.2.3.  Goggles and masks. 8.25.3.2.3.1.  Goggles,  safety  glasses  with  side  shields  or  mask  with  a  visor  will be worn anytime splashing of BBF is anticipated. (T-0) Normal eyeglasses are not considered  protective  apparel.  (T-0)  When  worn  for  PPE,  masks  and  goggles protect the wearer from splashes or sprays of BBF. (T-0) 8.25.3.2.3.2.  Fluid  resistant  surgical  masks  are  appropriate  and  will  be  changed when moist; as a general rule, change after 2 hrs. of wear or when wet. (T-0) 8.25.3.2.3.3.  The N95 respirator is approved for in-flight wear and will be worn by all caregivers when providing immediate care to a patient with a suspected or actual airborne transmissible infection. (T-1) Additionally, the N95 is worn by the patient for whom the disease is suspected. 8.25.3.2.3.3.1.  The  N95  mask  will  be  fit  tested  for  all  AECMs  by  a  local AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 173 Bioenvironmental Engineer or a certified fit-tester IAW AFOSHSTD 48-137; Respiratory  Protection  Program  and  local  policy  prior  to  wear  by  medical personnel.  (T-1)  NOTE:    Per  manufacturer’s  guidelines,  patients,  mission, and ground personnel who wear this mask do not require an official fit-testing but  the  medical  aircrew  member  will  evaluate  the  “fit”  of  the  mask  to  the patient’s face, and assure there are no gaps or leaks. (T-1) 8.25.3.2.3.3.2.  All  personnel  and  patients  will  change  the  N95  mask whenever wet or contaminated with BBF, if the straps are loose or if the mask is  damaged,  and  by  personnel  after  completing  direct  patient  care.  (T-1) NOTE:  The N95 mask will not be reused once it is removed. (T-1) 8.25.3.2.3.4.  Use  a  resuscitation  mask  or  bag-valve  mask  to  avoid  mouth-to-mouth contact. 8.25.3.3.  Needles and syringes/sharps. 8.25.3.3.1.  Do  not  recap  used  needles.  NOTE:   Recapping  is  acceptable  if  blood  is drawn  and  no  blood  tubes  are  available,  use  a  one-handed  scoop  technique.  Secure the cap with tape. 8.25.3.3.2.  Do not bend or break needles. 8.25.3.3.3.  Place needles in a puncture resistant container maintained as close to the point of use as possible. 8.25.3.3.4.  After securing the sharps container in the closed position, off-load sharps container according to local policy. 8.25.3.4.  Bio hazardous waste  . 8.25.3.4.1.  Bio  hazardous  waste  is  defined  as  liquid  or  semi-liquid  blood  or  other potentially infectious materials, contaminated items that would release blood, or other potentially infectious materials, in  a liquid  or semi-liquid  state if compressed.  Items that  are  caked  with  dried  blood  or  other  potentially  infectious  materials  and  are capable of releasing these materials during handling; contaminated sharps (see above for disposal  of sharps), or pathological  and microbiological  wastes containing blood or other potentially infectious materials. 8.25.3.4.2.  Place  a  red  biohazard  bag  at  the  end  of  the  patient’s  litter,  if  BBF  is expected. Biohazard bags will not to be used for trash that is not contaminated with BBF waste. 8.25.3.4.3.

Shelf-life (sterility) is either event-related and/or time-related: 8.25.3.9.3.3.  Event-related  sterility  means  that  as  long  as  an  “event”  has  not occurred  to  compromise  sterility,  the  item  is  considered  sterile.  An  event  may include any of the following:  the package is torn, ripped open, compromised in a way that causes the healthcare worker to question the integrity of the contents. 8.25.3.9.3.4.  Date-related sterility is based on the type of packaging and will have a tag with an expiration date. (T-0) 8.25.3.9.4.  Disposable items are not reused or reprocessed. 8.25.4.  The  following  patient  movements  will  be  specially  coordinated  by  the  PMRC  and GPMRC.  (T-2)  Multi-drug  resistant  Mycobacterium  Tuberculosis  (MDR-TB),  Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), plague, smallpox, cholera, yellow fever, typhus, ebola, malaria,  polio,  influenza,  and  any  other  diseases  under  special  surveillance  by  the  CDC. GPMRC will notify  TCSG, AMC/SG or when applicable, the CDC. (T-0) Plague, smallpox, hemorrhagic  fevers  require  approval  of  the  destination  country,  over-flight  privileges,  and approval  of  any  country  where  the  aircraft  will  land  for  servicing  or  where  the  patient  will remain  overnight.        (T-2)  Coordination  between  the  Geographic  Combatant  Commander, USTRANSCOM/CC and TCSG and the Department of State is required. 8.25.5.  Transmission based  isolation precautions.  There are 2 tiers to isolation. The first is  the  use  of  Standard  Precautions  with  every  patient  contact.  The  second  tier  is  the transmissions  based  precautions suspected  pathogenic microorganisms,  communicable  diseases,  or  colonized  pathogenic  microorganisms.  For further guidance, AFI11-2AE V3 and AFMAN 44-156. isolating  known  or for 8.25.6.  Airborne  precautions.  Airborne  Precautions  prevent  transmission  of  suspended infectious  agents  that  remain  infectious  over  long  distances  through  very  small  particles  or droplet nuclei. When they are inhaled by a susceptible individual, they enter the respiratory tract and can cause infection. Since air currents can disperse these particles or droplet nuclei over  long  distances,  airborne  transmission  does  not  require  face-to-face  contact  with  an infected individual. Airborne transmission only occurs with infectious agents that are capable of surviving and retaining infectivity for relatively long periods of time in airborne particles or droplet nuclei. Only a limited number of diseases are transmissible via the airborne route. Two  examples  of  airborne  transmissible  agents  include  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  which causes tuberculosis (TB) and the rubella virus which causes measles. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 177 8.25.6.1.  Isolate  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.  Patient  placement  should  be  in  a  low traffic area, downwind in the airflow circulation cycle and near the aircraft’s airflow exit, if possible. 8.25.6.2.  The  aircraft  airflow  (Attachment  14)  will  determine  patient  placement.  (T-2) Minimum  isolation  requirements  are  to  position  no  other  patients  within  ten  feet  of  the patient.  A  litter  is  optional  and  will  be  placed  in  the  lowest  position  in  the  tier.  (T-2) Ambulatory patients should be seated next to the sidewall. (T-2) 8.25.6.3.  The CDC recommends the use of filtering devices that have N, P, or R series filters with minimum filter efficiency of 95 percent, such as the N95 filtering face piece (N95 mask). Required protective procedures are outlined below: 8.25.6.3.1.  The patient will wear a N95 mask at all times. (T-1) This mask need not be fit tested but should not have noticeable gaps. NOTE:  Patients requiring airborne precautions  and  O2  may  wear  the  N95  mask  over  the  nasal  cannula  (1-4  LPM). Patients requiring higher levels of O2 may require a cabin altitude restriction or may wear  a  non-rebreather  O2  mask.  WARNING:    The  lowest  O2  percent  of  the  non-rebreather mask is 60%, and the patient must be able to tolerate high levels of O2 for the duration of the flight. (T-0) This mask does not have High Efficiency Particulate Air  (HEPA)  capability  but  has  the  smallest  exhalation  openings  of  the  O2  masks. Patients using the non-rebreather will be placed as close as possible to the aircraft’s exhalation port during the flight. (T-0) 8.25.6.3.2.  HCWs will wear a fit-tested N95 mask while within ten feet of the patient or while providing direct patient care. Refer to AFI 44-108, Infection Prevention and Control Program. (T-1) 8.25.6.4.  Unless directed by the theater director of air operations and the theater surgeon and/or TCSG; other  crewmembers, attendants  and passengers do not  require respiratory protection  unless  they  are  within  ten  feet  of  the  patient.  When  within  10  feet  of  the patient, the N95 mask for these individuals does not need to be fit-tested but should not have noticeable gaps. 8.25.7.  Strict  airborne  precautions.  Some  infectious  agents,  and  the  patient’s  overall clinical  condition,  may  require  strict  airborne  precautions  on  a  designated/devoted  mission with limited crew and with no other patients or passengers on board. Exception:  In extreme instances, the theater surgeon and the director of theater airlift operations will determine the use of the above aircraft for AE intratheater operations. (T-2) Theater surgeons will receive approval  from  destination  MAJCOM/CC  and  MAJCOM/SG,  and  the  USTRANSCOM/CC and  TCSG  to  use  these  aircraft  during  AE  intertheater  operations.  (T-2)  NOTE:    Consider regional medical intelligence reports and threats when validating and planning AE transport. WARNING:  MDR-TB and infectious ventilated patients pose the highest risk to the HCW, crew  and  passengers  due  to  the  potential  for  aerosolization  of  respiratory  secretions  and droplet nuclei. 8.25.7.1.  The  patient,  MAs,  and  all  mission  crewmembers  (e.g.  loadmaster,  boom operator,  etc.)  in  the  cargo/passenger  compartment  will  wear  a  N95  mask  for  the  entire mission. (T-1) HCWs and AECMs will wear a fit tested N95 mask. (T-1) The patient and 178 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 nonmedical  crewmembers  do  not  need  to  be  fit-tested  for  a  N95  mask  but  the  mask should not have noticeable gaps. 8.25.7.2.  The flight deck crew in aircraft with forward to aft airflow do not require N95 masks unless in the cargo/passenger compartment; the N95 mask does not need to be fit-tested but should not have noticeable gaps. The MCD will coordinate mission N95 mask requirements with the PIC and flight deck. 8.25.7.3.  On  an  aircraft  with  aft  to  forward  airflow  or  an  aircraft  with  mixing cargo/passenger  compartment  air,  flight  deck  personnel  will  wear  a  N95  mask  for  the entire mission; the N95 mask does not need to be fit tested but should not have noticeable gaps. (T-1) 8.25.7.4.  The  N95  mask  will  not  be  removed  to  eat  or  drink.  (T-1)  Mission  planning should incorporate this requirement. A straw may be used for ral fluids or an IV may be ordered for hydration. 8.25.7.5.  C-17 crewmembers, in the flight deck and crew rest areas, can remove the N95 mask  as  long  as  the  door  to  the  cargo  compartment  is  closed  and  the  environmental system is operating in the “high-flow” mode. 8.25.7.6.  The  flight  deck  crew  may  optionally  use  the  aircraft  O2  supply  and  wear  the aviator mask with the regulator set at normal which delivers 100% O2. 8.25.7.7.  Ventilators  will  have  a  HEPA  filter  connected  to  the  ventilator’s  expiratory port.       (T-1) Secure ventilation tubing connections and use in-line suctioning. NOTE:  High PEEP settings may not be possible using a HEPA filter. 8.25.7.8.  Cleaning of patient care area will occur as outlined. (T-1) NOTE:  No one will enter the aircraft without a N95 filter mask until the aircraft is aired out. (T-1) MCD will coordinate via the off-load message N95 mask requirements with mission ground support personnel.  (T-3)  All  mission  personnel  and  medical  personnel  will  follow-up  after mission completion at their local MTF or IAW local policy. (T-3) 8.25.8.  Airborne precautions:  Pre-mission and post-mission requirements. 8.25.8.1.  The  MCD  will  coordinate  mission  N95  mask  requirements  with  the  PIC  and medical support personnel. (T-3) 8.25.8.2.  Instruct the crewmembers and ground personnel on the correct fitting and wear of the N95 mask IAW Bioenvironmental Engineer guidance. Refer to AFI 44-108. 8.25.8.3.  Pre-mission  planning  includes  sufficient  number  of  N95  masks  and  PPE  to meet  mission  requirements,  including  replacements  due  to  contamination,  damage,  and limits  of  the  mask.  Planning  should  also  include  extra  N95  masks  for  ground  support personnel. 8.25.8.3.1.  The  use  of  cough  suppressants  may  be  indicated  for  patients  who  are actively coughing. 8.25.8.3.2.  Patients will wear a N95 mask prior to leaving the MTF’s isolation room and  will  wear  the  mask  until  admitted  to  the  receiving  MTF’s  or  RON  MTF’s isolation room. (T-1) AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 179 8.25.8.4.  At  mission  termination,  the  following  information  will  be  submitted  to  the PMRC and the unit infection control or public health officer:  Mission number/date, total time the patient was on the aircraft, personnel’s name, rank, unit of assignment and phone number; mission position, and approximate time in direct patient care. (T-2) 8.25.8.4.1.  Upon mission termination, all exits and doors are opened and the interior of  the  aircraft  is  aired  out.  Refer  to  AFMAN  10-2503,  Operations  in  a  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Environment, aircraft decontamination section. This may be done at home station but all personnel must continue to wear masks until airing-out is complete. (T-1) 8.25.8.4.2.  The exposed individual’s home station public health office will evaluate the need for follow-up testing and prophylaxis. If not at home station, contact C2 of the mission. (T-2) 8.25.8.4.3.  All mission and medical personnel will have a follow-up Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) 90 days after mission completion at their local MTF or IAW local policy, if patient had diagnosis of TB. (T-3) Results will be forwarded to the PMRC 100  days  post-mission.  (T-2)  The  PMRC  will  then  review  and  forward  personnel mission data to  AMC/SGP. (T-2) 8.25.8.5.  Transport of patients with known TB; including infants and young children. 8.25.8.5.1.  Patients  with  pulmonary  TB  responding  to  treatment  (known  drug sensitivity  and  clinical  signs  of  improvement)  may  be  safely  transported  on  any aircraft without respiratory protection when they meet all of the following criteria: 8.25.8.5.1.1.  Have negative sputum smears on three consecutive days. 8.25.8.5.1.2.  Received at least 14 or more days of appropriate treatment. NOTE:  Patients  with  laryngeal  TB  will  receive  at  least  30  days  of  therapy  with appropriate treatment regardless of smear status. (T-0) 8.25.8.5.1.3.  Are not coughing. 8.25.8.5.2.  Use standard and airborne precautions if the above criteria are not met or in  undiagnosed pulmonary  infectious disease processes in which TB is  suspected or possible. Refer to Attachment 15. 8.25.8.5.3.  HIV  infected  patients  going  for  evaluation  of  a  new  undiagnosed pulmonary process will be transported as possible active TB. 8.25.9.  Droplet Precautions.  Use with patients who have infections spread by large particle droplets generally larger than 5µ in size, generated by the infected patient during coughing, sneezing, talking, or during respiratory-care procedures. This includes microorganisms such as pneumonic plague, tularemia, CCHF, rubella, diphtheria, mumps, pertussis, influenza, and adenovirus. 8.25.9.1.  Spreads via droplets through the air by coughing, sneezing or talking. 8.25.9.2.  Droplets can travel up to 3 feet. 8.25.9.3.  Transmitted through mucosal surfaces (conjunctiva, nasal, and oral mucosa). 180 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.25.9.4.  Instruct the patient on the wear of the N95, the use and disposal of tissues in the appropriate waste bag, and washing hands. 8.25.9.5.  All  caregivers  and  AECMs  within  3  feet  of  the  patient  care  area  will  follow Standard, Droplet, and Contact Precautions (N95 mask, gown, gloves, and goggles). (T-0) 8.25.9.6.  Follow  the  guidelines  for  Airborne  Precaution  Guidelines  to  position  on aircraft. 8.25.10.  Contact  precautions.  Use  with  patients  who  are  infected  or  colonized  by  a microorganism that spreads by direct contact (skin-to-skin) or indirect contact (touch) with a contaminated object in patient’s environment. (e.g. GI, respiratory, skin or wound infections, antimicrobial resistant microorganisms such as vancomycin and methicillin resistant bacteria, scabies,  pediculosis,  and  Acinetobacter  baumannii  are  in  this  category).  Follow  Standard Precaution  Guidelines.  NOTE:    Use  N95  mask,  gown,  and  gloves  when  providing  direct care. 8.25.10.1.  Suspect  multi-drug  resistant  organisms  in  patients,  who  sustained  a  wound during combat or while deployed, have been hospitalized more than one week, were in a critical care setting, are recovering from multiple traumas, have indwelling catheters, and multiple tubes. 8.25.10.2.  A  clean  sheet  or  chux  may  be  placed  over  the  wound  site  to  prevent contamination of litter or seat. Treat all linens as infectious. 8.25.10.3.  Suspect C. Difficile if the patient has a history of recent antibiotic use, loose stools greater than 3 in 24 hours and/or elderly. 8.25.11.  Infection control special interest items  . 8.25.11.1.  Vaccinia  patients.  Vaccinia  virus  infections  are  complications  of  smallpox vaccination.  This  infection  should  not  be  confused  with  smallpox  disease,  caused  by variola  virus.  While  vaccinia  is  a  contact  transmission  hazard  (i.e.  contagious),  it  is significantly less infectious and pathogenic than variola (smallpox). 8.25.11.1.1.  Vaccinia  patients  are  contact standard/contact transmission based precautions, including: transmission  hazards  and  require 8.25.11.1.1.1.  Thorough hand washing after patient contact is the most important. 8.25.11.1.1.2.  Wear  of  PPE  (gloves,  gowns,  and,  depending  on  lesion  site, goggles). 8.25.11.1.1.3.  Handle of BBF as infectious for blood-borne pathogens. 8.25.11.1.1.4.  Terminal cleaning of the patient area. 8.25.11.1.1.5.  There  is  no  airborne/droplet  threat  so  respiratory  masks  are  not required. 8.25.11.1.1.6.  A  clean  sheet  or  chux  will  be  placed  over  the  site  to  prevent contamination of the litter or seat; treat all linens as infectious. (T-0) AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 181 8.25.11.1.2.  For those directly caring for a vaccinia patient, the following additional screening criteria may be considered, but is not mandatory: 8.25.11.1.2.1.  No  immunosuppression  due  to  medication  or  underlying  medical condition. 8.25.11.1.2.2.  No  history  of  eczema,  atopic  dermatitis  or  active  skin  disease (including psoriasis, moderately severe acne, and other forms of dermatitis). 8.25.11.1.2.3.  Not pregnant or attempting to become pregnant. 8.25.11.1.2.4.  No recent photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) or use of ophthalmic steroid drops. 8.25.11.1.2.5.  Not breastfeeding. 8.25.11.1.3.  Recent  smallpox  vaccination  is  highly  recommended  for  all  medical personnel,  including  AECM,  ERCC  team,  and  MA  directly  caring  for  vaccinia patients to prevent complications of vaccination at unintended body sites (i.e. fingers, hands, face). 8.25.11.1.4.  Vaccinia  wounds  must  be  covered,  preferably  with  dry,  cotton  gauze dressings, and are reinforced in-flight, as needed. (T-0) Occlusive dressings should be avoided. Do not change dressings in-flight; reinforce only. 8.25.11.1.5.  Requires dedicated PMI. 8.25.11.1.6.  Minimize  potential  for  cross-contamination  of  non-vaccinia  patients. When  feasible,  assign  a  single  caregiver.  If  operationally  feasible,  personnel  caring for  vaccinia  patients  should  not  be  assigned  to  care  for  patients  with  the  following medical  conditions:    Immunosuppression,  to  include  HIV,  cancer,  burns,  sepsis, autoimmune  disorders,  trauma,  steroid  use,  skin  disease,  pregnancy,  breast-feeding, or recent PRK. 8.25.11.2.  Managing  suspected  highly  communicable  diseases.  Refer  to  the  TCSG Interim Policy on Movement Regulation of Aeromedical Evacuation of Bioterrorism and Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  Bioterrorism  Agents/Diseases;  and  rule  out clinical (ROC) list. https://intelshare.intelink.gov/sites/ustcsg/SitePages/Home.aspx. 8.25.11.2.1.  Transported on a dedicated mission with the minimum number of crew members. 8.25.11.2.2.  If  possible,  place  a  N95  or  surgical  mask  on  the  patient  to  contain droplets  expelled  during  coughing.  If  this  is  not  possible  (i.e.,  would  further compromise respiratory status, difficult for the patient to wear), have the patient cover the mouth/nose with tissue when coughing. 8.25.11.2.3.  Oxygen  delivery  with  a  non-rebreather  face  mask  may  be  used  to provide  oxygen  support  during  transport.  If  needed,  positive-pressure  ventilation should be performed using a resuscitation BVM, preferably one equipped to provide HEPA  or  equivalent  filtration  of  expired  air.  If  a  patient  has  been  mechanically ventilated  before  transport,  HEPA  or  equivalent  filtration  of  airflow  exhaust  will  be used. (T-2) 182 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 8.25.11.2.4.  Healthcare providers who directly handle a patient infected with a highly pathogenic respiratory illness, such as pandemic influenza and severe ARDS, or who are in the compartment with the patient will wear PPE as recommended for Standard, Contact,  and  Airborne  Precautions.  (T-0)  This  includes:    disposable  isolation  gown, gloves, eye protection, and N95 mask. (T-0) 8.25.11.2.5.  Immediate  post-exposure  follow  up  for  flight,  support  and  medical personnel according to the TVFS. 8.25.12.  Contaminated and/or contagious patients. 8.25.12.1.  Patients known or suspected to be infected with a communicable disease will be treated-in-place in nearly all situations. (T-0) Under rare circumstances, the movement of  one  or  2  patients  ill  with  an  infectious  disease  may  be  essential  to  meet  critical operational  objectives.  These  situations  include  infections  with  a  pathogenic  agent  that may  pose  a  potential  threat  to  national  security,  require  special  public  health  actions, and/or  have  the  potential  to  cause  public  panic  and  social  disruption.  In  such  cases,  the geographic combatant commanders (CCDRs) will coordinate requests for movement of a potentially contagious patient with TCSG and Office of the Secretary of Defense with the approval  residing  with  the  United  States  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management (in coordination with the CDC). (T-0)  Additionally,  the  DoD  concurrence  for  movement  of  a  contagious  patient  will  be made  in  consultation  with  DoD  medical  authorities  (including    TCSG,  AMC/SG;  all parties must concur in order for the movement to occur). (T-0) 8.25.12.2.  Safe  transportation  of  AE  patients,  who  are  ill  with  an  a  droplet  or  airborne transmitted contagious  disease, will be  accomplished utilizing the Patient  Isolation  Unit (PIU). (T-0) The patient requiring the isolation will be transported to  a facility with the appropriate  bio-containment  level  for  identification  of  the  infectious  agent.  (T-0)  The isolation will include a specially trained ERCC team to care for the patient. (T-0) 8.25.12.3.  Natural  outbreaks  of  previously  unknown  diseases,  which  are  highly contagious, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and H1N1 influenza, are likely to occur. Bio-warfare pathogens remain easy to procure and cheap to manufacture, making their use by terrorists a significant threat to military and civilian populations. 8.25.12.3.1.  National security, global health concerns, or political considerations may necessitate  movement  of  one  or  2  highly  contagious  patients  for  evaluation  or treatment or development of methods for prevention and treatment. 8.25.12.3.2.  The AE/ERCC team capability to move contagious patients will only be used in extreme circumstances where it is necessary to transport 1 or 2 such patients to a diagnostic center with an appropriate level of bio-containment for identification of  the  infectious  agent.        (T-0)  These  dedicated  AE  missions  do  not  transport  any other patients. 8.25.12.3.3.  The PIU is  designed to provide isolation of a contagious patient during air  transport  and  has  been  approved  for  flight.  However,  potential  exposure  of aircrew, patients,  aircraft, and the surrounding environment to  contagious  pathogens may occur. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 183 8.25.12.3.4.  Use of the PIU will be governed by the Initial Capability Document for the to https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a3v/publications.aspx. (T-2)Refer AMC PIU CONOPS. 8.25.13.  Healthcare Worker Blood and Body Fluid Post-Exposure Plan. 8.25.13.1.  This  AFI  provides  guidance  for  Post-Exposure  Plan  (PEP)  regimens comprised  of  3  (or,  when  appropriate,  more)  antiretrovirals,  consistent  with  currently recommended treatment guidelines. Persons receiving PEP should complete a full 4-week regimen. The majority of data concerning adverse events has been reported primarily for persons  with  established  HIV  infection  receiving  prolonged  antiretroviral  therapy  and therefore might not reflect the experience of uninfected persons who take PEP. The term HCW refers to all paid and unpaid persons working in en route care settings who have the potential  for  exposure  to  infectious  materials,  including  body  substances  (e.g.,  blood, tissue,  and  specific  body  fluids),  contaminated  medical  supplies  and  equipment,  and contaminated environmental surfaces. 8.25.13.2.  The  most  important  strategy  for  preventing  occupationally  acquired  human immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  infection  and  other  blood-borne  pathogens  is  to implement  Standard  Precautions  coupled  with  Transmission-Base  Precautions.  For instances  in  which  an  occupational  exposure  has  occurred,  appropriate  post-exposure management  is  an  important  element  of  workplace  safety.  The  risk  of  acquiring  an infection depends upon the type of injury, the volume of material, and the patient’s virus titer.    An  exposure  that  might  place  HCW  at  risk  for  an  infection  is  defined  as  a percutaneous injury (e.g. a needle stick or cut with a sharp object) or contact of mucous membrane or nonintact skin (e.g. exposed skin that is chapped, abraded, or afflicted with dermatitis)  with  blood,  tissue,  or  other  body  fluids  (i.e.  semen  and  vaginal  secretions) potentially infectious. The following fluids are also considered potentially infectious but the  risk  for  transmission  is  unknown:  cerebrospinal  fluid,  synovial  fluid,  pleural  fluid, peritoneal  fluid,  pericardial  fluid,  and  amniotic  fluid.  Feces,  nasal  secretions,  saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and vomitus are not considered potentially infectious unless they are visibly bloody. 8.25.13.3.  Additional guidelines. 8.25.13.3.1.  Primary prevention of occupational exposures. 8.25.13.3.2.  Prompt  management  of  occupational  exposures  and,  if  indicated, initiation of PEP as soon as possible after exposure. 8.25.13.3.3.  Selection of PEP regimens that have the fewest side effects and that are best tolerated by prophylaxis recipients. 8.25.13.3.4.  Anticipating  and  preemptively associated with taking antiretroviral drugs. treating side-effects  commonly 8.25.13.3.5.  Attention  to  potential  interactions  involving  both  drugs  that  could  be included in PEP regimens and other medications that PEP recipients might be taking. 8.25.13.3.6.  Consultation  with  experts  on  post-exposure  management  strategies (especially determining whether an exposure has actually occurred and selecting PEP 184 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 regimens,  particularly  when experienced). the  source  patient is  antiretroviral treatment-8.25.13.3.7.  Testing  of  source  patients  (without  delaying  PEP  initiation  in  the exposed provider) using methods that produce rapid results. 8.25.13.3.8.  Counseling and follow-up of exposed HCW. 8.25.13.4.  The  current  PHS  guidance  recommends  prescribing  3  (or  more)  tolerable drugs  as  PEP  for  all  occupational  exposures  to  BBF.  Medications  included  in  a  PEP regimen should be selected to optimize side effect and toxicity profiles and a convenient dosing  schedule  to  encourage  HCW  completion  of  the  PEP  regimen.  In  instances  of  an occupational  exposure  to  drug-resistant  HIV,  administration  of  antiretroviral  agents,  to which the source patient’s virus is unlikely to be resistant, is recommended for PEP. 8.25.13.5.  The challenge to BBF exposure in the AE system is the HCW may not be in a facility. They may be in flight, in a high threat forward location, or in a temporary ERPS geographically separated from a fixed medical facility. 8.25.13.6.  The Public Health Service guideline has removed exposure codes. Contact the Patient Movement Requirements Center and the VFS as soon as operationally feasible. 8.25.13.7.  Initial Treatment.  Refer to AE Clinical Protocol - HCW BBF PEP. 8.25.13.7.1.  Information  to  relay  to  the  PMRC  and  VFS  includes:  Name,  SSN, date/time  of  injury/exposure,  unit  of  assignment,  phone,  home  phone,  date  of  last hepatitis  B  vaccine,  and  results  of  last  antibody/titer  screening,  if  known,  source  of BBF  and  how  the  exposure  occurred,  protective  items  worn,  volume,  duration, severity of exposure, and cite number of the source patient. 8.25.13.7.2.  Determine demographics of the source patient with the VFS if possible. 8.25.13.7.3.  The exposed HCW should report to a medical treatment facility, as soon as possible after the exposure, to address treatment options for the risk of hepatitis B virus  exposure.  If  the  HCW  was  immunized  against  hepatitis  B  virus  but  had  anti-HBs of less than 10 mIU/mL after vaccination, the source patient should be tested for HBsAg. If the source patient is HBsAg positive or unknown the HCW (with anti-HBs of  less  than  10  mIU/mL)  should  receive  2  doses  of  hepatitis  B  immunoglobulin (HBIG). The first dose should be administered as soon as possible after exposure and the second dose administered 1 month later. 8.25.13.7.4.  Administration of PEP for HIV should not be delayed while waiting for test  results.  If  the  source  patient  is  determined  to  be  HIV  negative,  PEP  should  be discontinued, and no follow-up HIV testing for the exposed provider is indicated. 8.25.13.7.5.  PEP is most effective when begun as soon as possible after the exposure and  PEP  becomes  less  effective  as  time  from  the  exposure  increases.  Occupational exposures  to  HIV  should  be  considered  urgent  medical  concerns  and  treated immediately.  PEP  is  not  justified  for  exposures  that  pose  a  negligible  risk  for transmission,  thus  making  the  communication  to  the  VFS  critically  important  to establishing the need for PEP. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 185 8.25.13.7.6.  The  PHS  now  recommends  Emtricitabine  (FTC)  plus  TDF  (these  2 agents  may  be  dispensed  as  Truvada,  a  fixed-dose  combination  tablet)  plus Raltegravir (RAL) as PEP for occupational exposures to BBF. 8.25.13.7.7.  HCW,  who  has  experienced  occupational  exposure  to  BBF,  should receive  follow-up  counseling,  post  exposure  testing,  and  medical  evaluation regardless  of  whether  they  take  PEP.  The  psychological  impact  of  needle  sticks  or exposure  to  blood  or  body  fluid  should  not  be  underestimated  for  HCW.  Exposed personnel should be advised to use precautions (e.g., use of barrier contraception and avoidance of blood or tissue donations, pregnancy, and, if possible, breast-feeding) to prevent secondary transmission, especially during the first 6–12 weeks after exposure. Providing HCW with psychological counseling should be an essential component of the management and care of exposed HCW. 8.25.13.7.8.  If PEP is used, HCW should be monitored for drug toxicity by testing at baseline and again 2 weeks after starting PEP. In addition, HCW taking antiretrovirals should be evaluated if any acute symptoms develop while receiving therapy. Exposed HCW, who choose to  take PEP, should be advised of the importance of  completing the prescribed regimen. 8.25.13.7.9.  Refer to AE Clinical Protocol - HCW BBF PEP for drug prescriptions. 8.25.13.7.10.  The PIC, MCD, and AECMs will assess the situation and the condition of the HCW to determine if the mission will continue or divert to a MTF capable of handling the situation. (T-3) 8.25.13.7.11.  Documentation includes: Completion of the DD Form 2852. (T-2) The HCW  will  maintain  a  copy  of  all  paperwork.  (T-2)  The  HCW  will  follow  up  with their local or home base military MTF. (T-2) 8.25.13.7.12.  Performance  Improvement  monitoring  includes  validating  the  HCW exposure follows the AE Clinical Protocol guidelines,  notifying the VFS as soon as operationally possible.  Initial treatment should begin within 15 minutes of exposure, complete and submit DD Form 2852.

Submit DD Form 2852 into TRAC2ES PMQ-R database within 5 days of the incident. (T-2) Event did not reach patient and did not result in patient harm but, is a potential system issue, hazardous condition or has the potential to cause harm. Submit DD Form 2852 into TRAC2ES PMQ-R database within 5 days of the incident. (T-2) 9.6.  Event Categories. 9.6.1.  There are multiple categories and subcategories listed on the DD Form 2852 or in the TRAC2ES PMQ-R system. 9.6.2.  More  than  one  category  and  sub-category  may  be  selected,  however,  each  selection must be supported in the narrative event description. (T-2) See Attachment 15. 9.7.  Reporting a Medical Class A, B, or Significant C event. 9.7.1.  These events result in serious patient harm or change in patient condition. Patient care and  safety  come  first  and  will  be  managed  before  beginning  the  reporting  process.  (T-2) Reporting involves contacting appropriate C2 as soon as possible and completing a DD Form 2852. (T-2) The reporting process involves: 9.7.2.  DD Form 2852 (front and back) is used to document events that resulted in or had the potential  to  result  in  harm  to  anyone  in  the  AE.  A  DD  Form  2852  is  completed  by  any AECMs, ERCC team, MTF, ERPS personnel, etc., who witnesses an event. (T-2) The overall purpose is to capture AE patient safety and process trends. 9.7.2.1.  Complete the form with as much detail and specifics as possible. 9.7.2.2.  Patient  Movement  Quality  Report  (PMQ-R)  Generated  Log  Number  will  be obtained from TRAC2ES by unit patient safety personnel when DD Form 2852 is entered in TRAC2ES system. (T-2) 9.7.2.3.  If the DD Form 2852 is completed by patient staging or MTF staff, follow local MTF incident reporting policy in addition to completing this form. (T-2) 9.7.3.  Notify C2 of the event, steps taken to rectify and DD Form 2852 documentation in the most expedient manner available (e.g. radio, telephone, fax, e-mail). (T-2) 9.7.4.  All verbal notifications will be followed up with written documentation of event using DD Form 2852 and submitted into the TRAC2ES PMQ-R IAW Table 9.1. (T-2) 9.7.5.  The  governing  PMRC  will  collect  and  review  all  internal  PMRC  records  (i.e. TRAC2ES  audit  history,  PMR,  all  internal  notes,  daily  log  entries,  and  mission  tracking AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 195 records) regarding validation prior to movement within 3 hours of notification of a Medical Class A, B, or C event. (T-2) 9.7.6.  If  no  formal  review  is  required,  the  relevevant  organizational  and  patient  safety representatives  will  collate  reported  event  details  in  a  written  summary  and  submit  to respective leadership for awareness. 9.8.  PM Event Review. 9.8.1.  The goal of the Event Review is to identify systems factors that led to the event and solutions to prevent or reduce the likelihood of similar events in the future.  The product of the  Event  Review  is  a  written  team  report  consisting  at  a  minimum  of  a timeline  of  events across  the  continuum,  identified  contributing  factors  with  root  causes,  and  an  action  plan designed  to  eliminate  or  minimize  the  root  causes  of  the  event  and  improve  safety  of  the process.  The focus is on human factors, processes, and systems rather than individual blame.  Any  concern  for  professional  competence  should  be  identified  by  the  leadership  for appropriate Standard of Care review separate from the Event Review process. 9.8.2.  Authority:  An Event  Review may be requested by  any level  of leadership in  the AE system. 9.8.3.  The Event  Review is  a quality assurance  document and is  exempt from  discovery or further disclosure except as specified in 10 U.S.C. Section 1102. 9.8.4.  The  team  composition  will  be  determined  by  the  type  and  severity  of  the  event  and will be comprised of selected subject matter experts as determined by the event. (T-2) 9.8.5.  TCSG  Director  of  the  PMPS  and    AMC/SG  AE  PSM  will  provide  Event  Review Team training and assist the Review Team with the process. (T-2) 9.8.6.  For  system  level  event  reviews,  the  event  review  team  will  send  the  final  written report to  the respective GCC/Theater SG PSM, TCSG Director of the PMPS and AMC/SG AE PSM within 120 days of being directed to conduct an event review. (T-2) 9.8.7.  Leadership who directed the Event Review, will determine requirements for a formal outbrief. (T-2) 9.9.  PM Medical Incident Investigation (MII). 9.9.1.  A formalized structured investigation process with a primary purpose to find out how the system contributed to the adverse outcome by thoroughly investigating the facts in a non-punitive  way.  The  ultimate  goal  is  to  learn  from  the  event  and  improve  healthcare  by recommending system changes to reduce the risk of recurrence, thereby decreasing harm to patients.  While  differences  exist  between  a  MTF  and  a  PM/AE  MII,  it  is  still  a  medical incident  investigation  under  10  U.S.C.  Section  1102.  (T-2)  A  PM/AE  MII  may  involve multiple  geographic  locations,  services,  and  systems  of  care,  which  may  complicate  and significantly lengthen the investigative process. 9.9.2.  Authority:    TCSG,  AMC/SG,  GCC/SG,  or  Service  SG  may  direct  a  MII.  Upon initiation, the TCSG, as the single-manager for patient  movement,  will take the lead for all MII  with  in  the  AE.  (T-2)  The  PM/AE  MII  is  a  quality  assurance  document  exempt  from discovery or release IAW 10 U.S.C. Section 1102. 196 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 9.9.3.  The team compliment will be selected by TCSG and AMC/SG.  (T-2) If AFRC/ANG AECMs  are  involved,  the  respective  MAJCOM  will  be  contacted  for  appropriate  team representation.  (T-2) TCSG Director of the PMPS and AMC/SG AE PSM will provide MII Team training. (T-2) 9.9.4.  The  final  written  report  with  timeline,  findings,  and  recommendations  will  be forwarded to the respective TCSG, GCC/Theater SG, and AMC/SG within 90-days of team selection. (T-2) 9.9.5.  A formal out brief will be required. (T-2) Attendees to the out brief will be determined by  the  TCSG  and  AMC/SG.  (T-2)  At  a  minimum,  Air  Force  Medical  Operations  Agency (AFMOA)/CC and the involved Theater/SG will be a part of the out brief. When possible, if ARC  personnel  are  involved  in  the  event,  the  ARC  leadership  will  be  contacted  for  team inclusion (T-2) 9.9.6.  All  events  (particularly A, B, C) will be evaluated for the requirement or need of an event  review process  (MII  vs Event  Review).  (T-1)  At a minimum,  an appropriate level  of review will be done on all sentinel events (as defined by The Joint Commission and DoD). (T-1) The following events may warrant a MII (list is not all-inclusive): 9.9.6.1.  Any  event  or  series  of  events  which  either  caused,  or  could  cause,  significant harm or death. 9.9.6.2.  Events  where  an  objective  evaluation  cannot  be  accomplished  by  an  internal team. 9.9.6.3.  Events with media attention or high-level interests. 9.9.6.4.  Patient suicide, attempted suicide, or self-harm. 9.9.6.5.  Hemolytic  transfusion  reaction  involving  inappropriate  administration  of  blood or blood products. 9.9.6.6.  An  event  resulting  in  unanticipated  death  or  major  permanent  loss  of  function, not related to natural course of patient's illness or underlying condition. 9.10.  Clinical Operations Patient Safety Alert (COPSA). 9.10.1.  A  COPSA  is  a  patient  safety  alert  issued  by  TCSG  and/or  AMC/SG  in  order  to address a critical patient safety trend or a high-risk low-volume concern. The directions and guidelines will be followed by personnel in the AE system. (T-2) 9.10.2.  Current at https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/amcsg/AMCSG%20Policies/Forms/AllItems.aspx                      or through TCSG or AMC/SG. COPSAs are available AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 197 Chapter 10 MISSION IRREGULARITIES 10.1.  Cabin Altitude restriction. 10.1.1.  Cabin  altitude  restrictions  may  be  required  with  clinical  conditions  associated  with retained  air  such  as  head  injuries,  eye  injuries,  or  decompression  injuries.  If  an  altitude restriction is required it should be input on the patients PMR and document on the AF Form 3899 or EHR equivalent prior to validating the patient. 10.1.2.  Cabin altitude restriction could lengthen the flight time and increased turbulence may occur. The PRMC communicates the cabin altitude restriction to the governing AOC. 10.2.  Medical Emergency/Change in Patient Status  . 10.2.1.  In  the  absence  of  direct  physician  contact/supervision,  RNs  will  immediately  start interventions following the most current AHA ACLS algorithms, if appropriate. (T-1) All IV solutions will be either LR or NS. (T-1) 10.2.1.1.  FN/AET  refers  to  AFI  11-2AE  Vol  3  for  operational  information.  ERPS personnel follow MTF guidelines. 10.2.1.2.  Do  not  use  any  personal  identifying  information  when  transmitting  medical information. Only use the patient’s cite number for identification purposes. 10.2.2.  Be  ready  to  communicate  demographical  and  medical  information  quickly  and succinctly.  Also,  report  any  treatment/intervention  and  the  outcome.  Be  prepared  to request/receive orders, mission deviation/divert, etc. to expedite meeting patient and mission requirements. 10.2.3.  If  instructed  to  divert  or  expedited  landing  is  required,  ensure  proper  off-load message  using  AF  Form  3858,  Aeromedical  Evacuation  Off-Load  Message,  is  provided  to the airfield with equipment and personnel requirements. 10.2.4.  Anytime  a  patient  is  removed  from  a  flight  or  the  staging  facility  for  clinical evaluation  or  a  significant  change  in  status,  the  MCD/Chief  Nurse  will  notify  C2  and complete DD Form 2852. (T-2) C2 will contact the governing PMRC ASAP. (T-2) 10.2.5.  A qualified member of the medical crew should accompany the patient to the MTF, if  needed,  to  maintain  the  same  level  of  care  and  to  provide  report  to  the  MTF  accepting privileged provider. 10.2.5.1.  In some instances, a civilian ambulance will respond to transport the patient to the  MTF  and  the  local  memorandum  of  agreement  may  not  permit  military  medical personnel to ride in the ambulance. (T-2) 10.2.5.2.  If  a  member  of  the  medical  crew  cannot  accompany  the  patient  to  the  MTF, report will  be provided to the accepting MTF privileged provider via radio or telephone. (T-2) The cite number will be used on the radio or telephone to identify the patient due to HIPAA regulations. (T-1)  10.2.5.2.1.  The  original  AF  Form  3899  and  other  medical  records  will  accompany the patient to the MTF. (T-2) 198 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 10.2.5.2.2.  Whenever  possible,  the  MCD  will  ensure  a  copy  of  the  AF  Form 3899/DD  Form  602  is  faxed  to  the  PMRC.  (T-2)  If  the  AF  Form  3899  cannot  be copied,  provide  detailed  information  on  AF  Form  3829,  and  complete  DD  Form 2852. (T-2) 10.3.  Death In-flight/Do Not Resuscitate (DNR). 10.3.1.  For Death in Flight refer to AFI 11-2AE V3 for AECMs. 10.3.2.  DNR  orders.  AE/ERPS  can  accept  DNR  patients  with  approval  from  the  Theater VFS  and  will  be  matched  with  the  appropriate  level  of  care.  (T-2)  If  a  patient  death  is anticipated  while  a  patient  is  in  the  AE  system  and  a  decision  has  been  made  not  to resuscitate,  an  AF  Form  3838  will  be  completed  and  attached  to  AF  Form  3899.  (T-1) Attending physicians should address DNR status of peacetime AE patients facing imminent death  or  classified  as  very  seriously  ill,  recognizing  that  the  stresses  of  flight  may  pose significant  risk  for  precipitating  death.  The  theater  VFS  reserves  the  authority  to  deny movement by AE of peacetime patients for whom AE poses an unacceptable risk of death or injury. Patients may also be moved for organ donation or family requests when a DNR would not be appropriate. 10.3.2.1.  The  originating  physician  will  provide  the  following  documentation  before flight:  (T-2) 10.3.2.1.1.  A completed AF Form 3838. 10.3.2.1.2.  “Do  Not  Resuscitate”  order  on  the  AF  Form  3899  or  EHR  equivalent. DNR orders will not be written more than 72 hrs. before the originating flight. (T-2) 10.3.2.2.  Prior to flight, verify the order with the patient and/or the patient’s family. 10.3.3.  Countermeasures should aim to reduce the risk of precipitating the onset of death to the  greatest  extent  allowed  by  mission  constraints.  The  goal  of  AE  for  DNR  patients  is  to successfully  and  safely  deliver  them  to  the  requested  destination  ensuring  highest  level  of comfort  possible.  Consequently,  supportive  supplemental  oxygen  therapy,  IV  hydration  to combat  dehydration,  en  route  MAs,  and  a  cabin  altitude  restriction  should  not  be automatically ruled out because the patient is a “DNR.” 10.4.  Mission Delays. 10.4.1.  Refer to AFI 11-2AE V3. The medical crew is responsible for the welfare, safety and clinical  care  when  patients  are  deplaned  for  comfort  during  ground  operations.  Patient  care will continue without degradation through the delay; on the aircraft if delay is expected to be less  than  one  hour  or  in  the  nearest  medical  facility  if  the  delay  exceeds  three  hours. MTF/ERPS personnel will assist if available. (T-2) 10.4.2.  AECMs should consider:  Medical orders for treatments, medications and diet should be followed if applicable. Before continuing mission after delay, ensure enough medication, supplies (if available), and nourishment for remainder of mission. (T-2) 10.4.3.  If  a  mission  delay  occurs  while  the  patient  is  under  the  responsibility  of  the  ERPS personnel, the ERPS personnel in collaboration with the MCD, will evaluate the best location for the patient. (i.e. remain on the ambus or return to the staging area). (T-3) 10.5.  Medical Delays. AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 199 10.5.1.  Placing patients on medical hold.  In the event of changes in the patient’s condition, the  FS  may  place  a  patient  on  medical  hold,  not  to  exceed  72  hrs.  Patients  with  status changes may require admission to a MTF whereupon the FS will arrange for hospitalization and  a  continuation  PMR  will  be  initiated.  (T-2)  ERPS  personnel  will  notify  the  PMRC  of interruption of PM. (T-2) 10.5.2.  In  the  event  the  MCD/Chief  Nurse  is  concerned  a  patient  is  at  significant  risk  for flight, or requires care beyond the scope of the AE crew or ERPS, the MCD or Chief Nurse will call C2.  (T-2) The airlift agency will contact the governing PMRC for additional MAs, support  or  re-evaluation.  Depending  on  the  contingency/tactical  environment,  refusing  a patient for flight may not be a viable solution. (T-2) 10.6.  In-Flight Refueling Considerations  . 10.6.1.  Refer to AFI 11-2AE Vol 3 for operational information. 10.6.2.  During mission planning if in-flight refueling is required, the VFS will approve. (T-2) 10.6.3.  Patients prone to motion sickness (i.e. pregnancy, GI disturbances), anxiety, and pain from surgical or orthopedic injuries may require medication 20-30 minutes prior to refueling. 10.6.4.  Patients  with  head  and  spinal  injuries,  and  those  requiring  advanced  life-support, should be reassessed just prior to refueling. 10.7.  En Route Diversions. 10.7.1.  Should a request for diversion, unrelated to patent needs, be received, and the MCD determines  this  would  place  a  patient(s)  in  jeopardy,  immediate  communication  will  be established  with  C2.  (T-2)  The  airlift  agency  will  contact  the  governing  PMRC  to  discuss and resolve the situation.  (T-2)  The MCD is  responsible for determining what  is  beneficial for, or detrimental to patients on board. 10.7.2.  All patients on the mission will be briefed on the change in itinerary and the reasons for diversion. (T-2) 10.7.3.  AECMs  should  take  into  consideration  equipment,  medications,  supplies,  and nourishment for patient care due to diversion. 10.7.4.  If available, Patient Staging personnel will assist as necessary. (T-3) 10.8.  Scheduled and Unscheduled RONs. 10.8.1.  Refer to AFI 11-2AE V3. 10.8.2.  AE  missions  may  require  either  scheduled  or  unscheduled  RON  stops.  MTF commanders at locations where RONs occur are responsible for the care of patients, securing medical records and narcotics. 10.8.3.  RON  in  the  MTF  or  other  facilities.  If  patients  need  to  RON  in  the  MTF  or  other agency while transiting the AE system, they shall not be formally admitted to the MTF. (T-2) The  MTF  FS,  or  designee,  will  manage  the  medical  care  of  such  patients  and  will  reaffirm their readiness for flight. (T-2)  Patients in RON status at a civilian medical facility may be admitted, but the ERPS will retain them administratively as ERPS RON patients. (T-2) 200 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 10.8.4.  Unscheduled RONs. 10.8.4.1.  See 11-2AE V3. 10.8.4.2.  MCD  will  coordinate  with  C2  for  assistance  with  facility  points  of  contact  to assure patient needs are met. (T-2) 10.8.5.  Controlled  medications  will  be  stored  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-2  AE  Vol  3  and section 8.22 of this regulation.  (T-2) 10.8.6.  MTFs at both scheduled and unscheduled RON stations will: 10.8.6.1.  Assist with deplaning and enplaning patients. (T-2) 10.8.6.2.  Admit and assign patients to the MTF (civilian or military) or billeting facility as appropriate. (T-2) 10.8.6.3.  Provide food/meals for the patients. (T-2) 10.8.6.4.  Prepare and manage records.

Refer to AFI 11-2AE V3. AECMs/ Patient Staging personnel will document patient’s condition on AF form 3899 or EHR equivalent prior to the patient being released. (T-2) 10.9.2.  AECMs/  Patient  Staging  personnel  will  have  the  patient  or  guardian  complete  AF Form 3841, Certification of Release. (T-2) 10.10.  Prisoner-patients  . 10.10.1.  If a prisoner-patient becomes ill or injured during flight, AECMs will immediately give care within scope of practice. (T-2) MCD will contact C2 as soon as possible to notify and receive orders and any other operational direction. (T-2) Refer to AFI11-2AE V3. 10.10.2.  The  responsibility  of  the  clinician  is  to  provide  safe  clinical  support  during transportation. 10.10.3.  Clinicians will refrain from stating names, dates, times or locations. (T-2) 10.10.4.  The  guard  of  the  prisoner  may  consider  blindfolding  the  prisoner-patient  if indicated for personnel safety. 10.10.5.  When possible the prisoner-patient should be assigned one caregiver. 10.10.6.  When meals or snacks are provided do not allow handcuffs to be released except for range  of  motion.  At  the  guard’s  discretion,  the  blindfold  may  be  removed  during  meals.  If meals are provided with no visual blind, only the direct caregiver and guard will be with the patient. (T-2) The area must be sanitized as much as possible. (T-1) 10.10.7.  Prisoner-patients  will  be  treated  as  humanely  as  possible;  all  treatment  is accomplished in coordination of the guard. (T-2) AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 201 10.10.8.  Offer  toileting  and  liquids  every  2  hrs.  If  ambulatory,  the  guard  will  assist  to  the bathroom.  (T-2) The clinician will monitor the prisoner-patient for safety and care only and assist as clinically required. (T-2) 10.10.9.  The prisoner-patient will be the last to enplane and first deplaned.

Any unaccompanied minor, under the age of 18, or any unaccompanied non-active duty patient  who is  incapable of directing their own care, will have an  applicable power of attorney, attached to the DD Form 602, Patient Evacuation Tag, or AF Form 3899. (T-2) The PMRC;  coordination  with  the  originating  MTF,  is  responsible  for  obtaining  consent  before manifesting on AE missions. 10.11.2.  Minors under the age of 14 will have an attendant. (T-2) 10.11.2.1.  If  a  parent  or  guardian  cannot  accompany  a  minor  under  14,  the  originating medical facility will send a responsible adult as the NMA. (T-2) This NMA will carry a written Power of Attorney to cover the time period the minor will be in the AE system. (T-2) 10.12.  Conflict Resolutions. 10.12.1.  Conflicts should be resolved at the lowest level possible prior to elevating to C2. 10.12.2.  If AECMs or ERPS personnel experience conflicts with a patient in the AE system, contact C2, who in turn will contact the governing PMRC. (T-2) Document the incident on a DD Form 2852. (T-2) 10.13.  Credentials Considerations. 10.13.1.  All  registered  nurses  (RN)  and  medical  technicians  shall  be  familiar  with credentialing standards of nursing practice as described in current texts and references listed in this AFI.  (T-2) The AECMs, specialty team members, Patient Staging personnel and any other MAs have a responsibility to notify the MCD or Chief Nurse of all incidents, accidents, and  potential  legal  concerns  detected  during  the  mission.  Such  matters  shall  be  carefully documented as close to the occurrence as possible in the DD Form 2852 annd the AF Form 3829. (T-2) 10.13.2.  The  MCD  is  responsible  for  identifying  and  elevating  the  above  issues  to  C2  and PMRC. (T-2) The PMRC will ensure notification to  AMC/SG. (T-2) 10.13.3.  Clinicians  are  subject  to  adverse  clinical  action  in  response  to  a  threat  to  patient safety under AFI 44-119. 10.13.4.  In the event a patient or attendant is injured while in the AE System, the AE/ Patient Staging  personnel  will  document  the  injury  and  care  rendered  on  the  patient’s  medical record. (T-2) Complete and forward a DD Form 2852 to the unit patient safety manager. (T-2)  Document  occurrence  on  AF  Form  3829.  (T-2)  These  two  forms  are  protected  from disclosure under 10 U.S.C. Section 1102 and are not included in the patient’s record. 10.13.5.  Special considerations for patients who are seriously ill and those at significant risk. The  RN  may  sign  a  document  as  required  on  behalf  of  an  unconscious,  incompetent  or 202 AFI48-307V1  9 JANUARY 2017 infectious  patient,  and  if  physically  unable.  When  signing  for  the  patient,  indicate  “for unconscious patient, John Doe.” For other patients, an entry of “patient unable to sign” may be made. Two witnesses will sign the form in both instances. (T-2) 10.14.  Engine Running Off/On Loads (ERO). 10.14.1.  Refer to AFI 11-2AE V3. If an ERO is required, patient preparation includes:  Eye protection,  hearing  protection,  and  securing  all  medical  equipment  or  tubing  accompanying the patient. 10.14.2.  Explain to the patients what they can expect during this enplane/deplane procedure so as to minimize their anxiety. 10.15.  No and Low Light Conditions. 10.15.1.  Mobility aircraft used for AE typically provide poor to fair lighting for patient care. Flashlights  or  head-lamps  may  assist  with  lighting  conditions.

Top to bottom/forward to aft  KC-10  NOTES: A14.1. Cabin air in military aircraft usually does not recirculate or mix with flight deck air making HEPA filtering of air unnecessary. Cabin air in civilian aircraft may recirculate with flight deck air with or without HEPA filtering. A14.2. There is mixing of cargo compartment air and flight deck air. A14.3. Dependent on engine speed, altitude and pressurization. *AE adapted CDC recommendations for removal of TB airborne contaminants from isolation rooms. Upon mission termination when indicated, all exits and doors are opened and the interior of the aircraft is aired for the prescribed time. The aircraft air conditioning will be running at maximum capacity during the airing out time period. Must also defer to AFMAN 10-2503 as stated in Aircraft Decontamination section. (T-1) ( Recirculating fans in cargo compartment direct front to back when turned on; however, the airflow directed aft is at the compartment ceiling and will eventually flow forward along the cabin floor. In normal operations, cargo compartment air recirculates through a non-HEPA filter, and then mixes with flight deck air. 100% ambient air (RAM Air) is available if required when “hi-flow” is selected on the cockpit environmental control panel. (* 50% of cabin air recirculates with ambient air through a HEPA filter and does not mix with flight deck air. 100% ambient air is available if required. WARNING:  Due to aircraft airflow characteristics (aft to forward) and the extreme risk of transmission of infectious airborne agents to all on board personnel, the C-17, C-21 and C-130 will not be used unless all the criteria for safe transport, based on agent, are met. Exception:  In extreme instances, the theater surgeon and the director of theater airlift operations will determine the use of the above aircraft for AE intra-theater operations. (T-2) Theater surgeons will receive approval from destination MAJCOM/CC and MAJCOM/SG, and the TCSG/CC and TCSG to use these aircraft during AE inter-theater operations. (T-2) All passengers, patients, medical crew and other crewmembers on these missions will wear a N95 mask throughout the mission, and will receive the recommended post-exposure follow-up for flight, support and medical personnel according to the TVFS.
