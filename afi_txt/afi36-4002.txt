FLPB.  FLPB  is  a  monetary  incentive  paid  to  eligible  and  qualified  personnel  possessing foreign  language  proficiency.    The  objective  of  FLPB  is  to  encourage  the  acquisition, maintenance, and enhancement of foreign language skills vital to national defense.  The ability of the  Air  Force  to  interact  in  the  international  arena  and  respond  effectively  to  any  global contingency mandates the need for language-qualified personnel to communicate with our allies and  the  local  populations  as  well  as  with  our  adversaries  and  to  mitigate  threats  from  our adversaries. 1.1.1.  Individual  participation  is  voluntary.    An  airman's  application,  qualification,  and receipt of FLPB constitute acknowledgment that he or she may be called upon to respond to global contingency requirements. 1.2.  FLPB  Authorization.  FLPB  is  authorized  under  Title  37,  USC,  Section  353,  and  is administered according to DoDI 1340.27 and DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapter 19, Military Foreign Language Skill Proficiency Bonuses. 1.2.1.  The Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) determines which foreign languages, specialties, and duties qualify under the Air Force FLPB program.  SAF may initiate, terminate, increase, or decrease FLPB. 1.2.2.  HQ USAF/A1D Force Development is the Service Program Manager (SPM) and AF Senior  Language  Authority  (SLA)  for  the  Air  Force  Language,  Regional  Expertise  and Culture  (LREC)  Program  and  FLPB.    HQ  USAF/A1D  represents  the  Air  Force  in  the Defense  Foreign  Language  Program.    The  SPM  provides  management  policy  for  the development,  coordination,  and  conduct  of  the  FLPB  Program  as  well  as  for  the  LREC program.    At  the  direction  of  HQ  USAF/A1D,  this  AFI  assigns  responsibilities  required  to administer  FLPB  under  uniform  policy  within  existing  directives.    HQ  USAF/A1D determines which languages are authorized FLPB within the Air Force AFI36-4002  16 JUNE 2015   5  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Proficiency.  To  be  considered  proficient  for  the  purposes  of  FLPB,  an  Airman  must demonstrate appropriate Interagency  Language Roundtable (ILR) proficiency in  any two of the three modalities of listening, reading, or speaking on any range, Very Low Range (VLR), Lower Range  (LR), Upper Range (UR) (as stated in  3.4.2 below, for UR), of the DLPT, OPI or other Defense  Language  Institute  Foreign  Language  Center  (DLIFLC)-certified  and  DoD  approved test in a foreign language or dialect (subsequently referred to as language) listed on the current AF Strategic Language List (SLL). 3.2.  Certification Period.  The certification date for FLPB is the date of the most recently tested qualifying  modality.    A  commander  cannot  deny  an  Airman  the  opportunity  to  take  a  DLPT System test in order to qualify for FLPB. 3.2.1.  Individuals  are  solely  responsible  for  contacting  the  installation  testing  office  to arrange  for  initial  and  annual  testing,  understanding  that  failure  to  test  as  scheduled  may result  in  loss  of  FLPB.    The  individual’s  request  for  initial  testing  must  include acknowledgement that once qualified for FLPB, failure to retest annually will result in a loss of FLPB. 3.2.2.  FLPB certifications expire one year from the first day of the first month after the final certification  month.    Exception:  Certification  for  Airmen  who  score  3/3  or  higher  will  be waived to two years from the first day of the first month after the final certification month.  Example:    If  an  Airman  certifies  on  15  August  2012,  the  certification  will  expire  on  1 September 2013 (2014 for 3/3 or higher).  Airmen receiving FLPB will test within 12 months but  not  sooner  than  180  days  from  their  previous  administration.    Pay  rate  changes  for Airmen recertifying are effective on the date of the re-certification test.  The first month of eligibility will be a prorated payment.  Eligibility will continue until end of the 12th month. 3.2.3.  Airmen  who  are  unable  to  re-certify  within  270  days  of  certification  (15  months  for ILR  3/3  or  higher)  due  to  deployment,  ad-hoc  operations  or  duty  assignment  where DLPT/OPI  testing  facilities  are  not  available  or  accessible  will  maintain  their  previous qualifying  scores  and  certification  for  the  duration  of  the  deployment  and  up  to  180  days after returning from deployment with an AFPC approved Testing Waiver Due to Deployment Letter.  Prior to approving a DLPT waiver AFPC, in conjunction with the AF LREC Office will  consider  whether  a  member’s  DLPT  was  at  least  180  days  old  prior  to  his  or  her deployment;  if  it  is  determined  that  the  member’s  DLPT  is  more  than  180  days  old  the member likely would have had the opportunity to test prior to his or her deployment and may not receive a waiver.  Every situation is considered based upon a specific member’s situation.  Airmen must recertify before follow-on deployments. 3.2.4.  Members  whose  FLPB  certification  expires  while  attending  a  significant  language education  or  training  event  will  maintain  their  previous  DLPT/OPI  scores  and  certification during  the  duration  of  the  significant  language  training  event  for  up  to  180  days  after completion  of  the  event  and  remain  eligible  for  FLPB  during  that  time  with  an  AFPC approved Testing Waiver Due to Significant Language Training Event Letter. AFI36-4002  16 JUNE 2015   9  3.2.4. 1.   IAW DoDI 5160.71, a significant language education or training event is defined as at least 150 hours of language immersion training or six consecutive weeks of five-hour-a-day language classroom training, or other significant event as defined by the Secretary of the Air Force. 3.2.4.2.  Extension  of  FLPB  eligibility  during  other  types  of  significant  education  or training events will be considered on an ad-hoc basis by submitting an ETP IAW Chapter 5, Exceptions to Policy. 3.3.  FLPB Certification.  Qualifying scores are the two highest valid scores in any combination of two of the three modalities (i.e., listening/reading/speaking) on any range of DLPT (i.e., VLR, LR,  UR),  and/or  OPI  tests  taken  within  a  30-calendar-day  period  from  the  date  of  the  last  test taken.  For example, if a member takes the reading/listening DLPT on 1 Jun then their OPI test for speaking must be taken on/before 1 Jul.  The OPI can be matched with any DLPT modality for  FLPB  certification.    OPI  tests  could  take  three  to  six  months  to  schedule  and  complete; therefore, the AF LREC Office suggests that members schedule and take the OPI before taking the DLPT.  NOTE:  See paragraph 3.4.2. for specific guidelines on UR certification.  For those languages  which  only  have  a  single-modality  OPI,  that  OPI  score  may  be  recorded  as  both listening  and  speaking  to  meet  the  two  modality  requirement  for  FLPB.    DLPT  scores  from DLIFLC as well as those obtained during BMT are valid for FLPB. 3.3.1.  Dialect listening tests that pair with a base language reading test in order to meet the two modality requirement for FLPB are not required to be taken within 30 calendar days of the  reading  modality.   Airmen  should  contact  their  TCO  and/or  their  appointed representatives  with  questions  about  which  dialect  listening  tests  pair  with  a  base  language reading  test.    Example:    An  Airman  takes  the  Listening  and  Reading  modalities  of  the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) DLPT on 2 January 2012 and achieves a 3/3, qualifying the Airman to receive FLPB for MSA.  The Airman subsequently takes the Listening modality of the Arabic-Levantine DLPT on 15 June 2012 and achieves a 2+.  The Airman is able to pair his Arabic-Levantine listening modality with the MSA Reading modality to receive FLPB for Arabic-Levantine  at  2+/3,  beginning  on  15  June  2012.    The  Airman’s  certification  date  for MSA expires 1 Feb 2013, but the member will remain eligible for Arabic-Levantine until 1 July  2013.    For  members  who  take  the  reading  portion  of  the  MSA  DLPT  but  not  the listening, the reading DLPT for MSA will still be valid for use with other Arabic dialect tests. 3.3.1.1.  The  one-year  certification  period  for  the  dialect  will  begin  on  the  date  of  the dialect listening test and will not change until the member next takes the dialect listening test  or  until  the  certification  expires,  regardless  of  any  change  in  the  base  language reading score.  The member must already have a current MSA reading DLPT with which to pair a dialect listening DLPT. 3.3.1.2.  An  OPI  score  may  be  substituted  for  the  dialect  listening  or  base  language reading score to meet the two-modality requirement for FLPB. 3.3.2.  For those who have received dialect training at the DLIFLC for which any modality of the  base  language  was  also  taught,  the  base  language  will  also  be  considered  to  have  been taught.  Example:    A  member  attends  DLIFLC  for  Arabic-Levantine.    Because  Modern Standard Arabic Reading is also taught in conjunction, for FLPB purposes Modern Standard Arabic will also be considered as having been taught at DoD expense, and will be eligible for FLPB at the Enhancement rate.   10  AFI36-4002  16 JUNE 2015 3.3.3.  The  UR  DLPT  may  be  used  for  certification  above  ILR  level  3  (i.e.,    3+  and  4).  Airmen may take the UR test in any modality on which they scored a 3 on the LR DLPT or 3+ or higher on the UR DLPT for the specified language.  The initial UR test may be taken immediately after the score for the LR test has been posted to the DLPT Authorization and Reporting system, but must be completed within 90 days of the date of the LR test to be valid for certification purposes.  Once the initial portion of the UR test has been taken, all portions must  be  completed  within  30  calendar  days  to  be  valid  for  certification.    If  a  member achieves a score above ILR level 3 on the UR test, the certification date will become the date the UR test was completed.  If the member scores a level 3 in listening or reading on the UR test, the date of certification will remain the date the LR test was completed and the member must take the LR DLPT for their next certification. 3.3.4.  Airmen  may  not  test  more  than  twice  on  the  same  range  of  DLPT,  in  the  same language, in a one year period.  This is a mandatory DoD requirement and cannot be waived at the AF level. 3.4.  Payment.  Listening,  Reading,  and  Speaking  proficiency  levels  will  be  used  to  determine the  amount  of  pay.    A  minimum  proficiency  of  2/2  is  required  in  at  least  two  of  the  three modalities (listening/reading/speaking) in order to determine the amount of proficiency bonus a member is eligible to receive.  Exceptions to this policy will be determined by the AF SLA based on  contingency  deployment  position  requirements  and  specific  special  operations  position requirements.  See paragraphs 4.4.2 and 4.8, respectively. 3.4.1.  In accordance with DoDI 1340.27, FLPB payments are authorized as follows: 3.4.1.1.  Payments will be made in monthly installments. 3.4.1.2.  Payments will not exceed $12,000 over a single year of certification. 3.4.2.  The  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  and  Service  member  will  make  a  written  agreement (template provided in appendix 4) regarding FLPB.  The agreement: 3.4.2.1.  Must specify the amount of the FLPB awarded, the period for which the FLPB will be paid, and the initial certification or recertification necessary for FLPB payment. 3.4.2.2.  Must  include  a  provision  discussing  repayment  of  the  unearned  portion  of  any remaining  FLPB  if  the  Service  member  does  not  satisfy  the  eligibility  and  certification requirements  for  the  length  of  the  written  agreement  or  separates  from  service  before expiration of the FLPB certification period. 3.4.3.  Total  payments  shall  not  exceed  $500  per  month  for  any  single  language,  or  $1,000 per month for any combination of languages. 3.4.4.  Languages  designated  Prevalent  in  the  Force  (PIF)  on  the  current  AF  SLL  are  not authorized for FLPB except as outlined below in Chapter 4, FLPB Eligibility.  PIF languages are those identified on the AF SLL as having sufficient capacity within the AF. 3.4.5.  Airmen  proficient  in  language(s)  outside  of  what  is  required  in  their  current  billets and/or  their  Control  Language(s)  (CLANG(s))  may  receive  FLPB  for  those  additional language(s)  IAW  paragraph  4.15,  All  Others,  or  IAW  other  paragraphs  that  may  apply.  CLANG is defined in Chapter 4 below, for each language community. AFI36-4002  16 JUNE 2015   11  3.4.6.  Payments  are  authorized  according  to  the  rules  outlined  in  Table  1:    AF  FLPB Payment Rate Categories, below. Table 3.1.

FLPB is effective the date of testing.  Pay rate changes are also effective the date of the test. 3.5.  De-authorization of FLPB 3.5.1.  Start  and  Stop  of  FLPB.    FLPB  starts  on  the  date  of  qualifying  certification.    FLPB normally is authorized for up to 12 months.  Recertification earlier than the anniversary date will  affect  the  eligibility  period  and  rate  based  on  the  new  certification.    FLPB  may  be stopped  for  a  variety  of  reasons.    These  reasons  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  change  in qualification,  changes  in  policy,  departure  from  duties  requiring  language  proficiency,  and failure to test in a timely manner.  Where FLPB is based upon an Airman’s assignment to a language-coded billet, FLPB will be stopped when the billet is vacated. 3.5.2.  Responsibility  to  Stop  FLPB.    It  is  incumbent  upon  the  Airman  to  notify  their servicing  installation  TCO  and/or  their  appointed  representatives  upon  detachment  from  a billet requiring language.  Airmen receiving FLPB for PIF languages based on assignment to a billet  coded for that language are responsible for contacting their installation TCO and/or their appointed representatives to stop their FLPB payment upon transfer from the authorized billet.  Failure to do so may result in overpayment, which will be recouped.   12  AFI36-4002  16 JUNE 2015 Chapter 4 FLPB ELIGIBILITY 4.1.  Requirements for FLPB Eligibility. 4.1.1.  RegAF  Airmen  and  Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC)  Airmen  entitled  to  basic  pay under Title 37, USC, Section 204 must: 4.1.1.1.  Be entitled to basic pay under Title 37, USC, Section 204. 4.1.1.2.  Be  certified  as  proficient  as  outlined  in  Chapter  3  using  the  DLPT  System  of tests and eligibility requirements outlined in this Chapter. 4.1.2.  Air  Reserve  Component  (includes  Air  Force  Reserves  and  Air  National  Guard) Members may be paid in advance for duty to be performed (ie UTA), but will be recouped for unsatisfactory performance. In order to receive FLPB in a similar fashion to their RegAF counterparts  if  not  entitled  to  basic  pay  under  Title  32  USC  Section  204,  (ARC)  members must: 4.1.2.1.  Meet  the  certification  requirements  outlined  in  Chapter  3  and  eligibility requirements outlined in this Chapter. 4.1.2.2.  ARC  members  must  be  entitled  to  compensation  under  Title  37  USC  Section 206. 4.1.2.3.  Fulfill  minimum  annual  service  requirements  for  retirement  eligibility  pursuant to section 12732 of Title 10, USC (Reference (j)), unless waived by the Secretary of the Air  Force.  ARC  members  must  earn  a  minimum  of  50  retirement  points,  regardless  of ARC  source,  in  each  full  anniversary  year  to  have  that  year  creditable  towards verification  of  the  total  years  of  qualifying  service  for  non-regular  retired  pay  and  the payment of FLPB. 4.1.2.3.1.  A partial qualifying  year is  any period  of less than 12  full months during which  the  ARC  member  earns  a  pro-rated  share  of  50  retirement  points  and  an identical  pro-rated  share  (or  smaller  percentage  of  full  FLPB  annual  payment)  of FLPB. 4.1.2.3.2.  ARC  members  who  perform  a  partial  qualifying  year  of  less  than  12  full months  and  earn  less  than  50  retirement  points  in  a  year  will  have  their  FLPB  pro-rated at a value of 2 percent for each retirement point less than 50 points.  Members may be paid in advance for duty to be performed (i.e. UTA), but will be recouped for unsatisfactory performance. 4.1.2.3.3.  For  example:  an  ARC  member  who  is  certified  2/2  proficient  in  an Enhancement  Rate  language  would  receive  annual  FLPB  of  $2,400  for  earning  50 retirement points in  an  anniversary  year  – the same as the RegAf member who  was certified  proficient  for  a  full  year.  If  another  ARC  member  with  identical  foreign language  qualifications  as  the  ARC  member  above  only  amassed  25  points  in  their anniversary year, that member would receive: 25 points / 50 points or 1/2 the annual FLPB of $2,400 = $1,200 FLPB. AFI36-4002  16 JUNE 2015   13  4.1.2.3.4.  In  accordance  with  chapters  57  and  58,  paragraphs  570306  and  580302, respectively  of  Volume  7A  of  DoD  Financial  Management  Regulations,  DoD 7000.14-R, the sum total of FLPB paid to RC members who are in good standing and who  have  not  been  adjudicated  as  unsatisfactory  performers  in  the  previous  12 months must equal the annual FLPB paid to an AC member with the same certified language proficiency. 4.1.2.3.5.  For ARC members, the requirement to attain 50 points during a separation year  is  waived  for  an  ARC  FLPB  calculation  if  the  member  separates  before  12 months  in  the  anniversary  year.  In  such  a  case,  the  ARC  member  will  be  paid  the standard FLPB monthly allotment for months in good standing, with the final month pro-rated  if  separation  occurs  before  the  last  day  of  the  month.  ARC  members  in  a separation year who fall from a good standing status will have their FLPB terminated in  the  month  in  which  they  fall  from  that  status.  The  exception  to  the  50  point standard  in  a  separation  year  is  an  ARC  member  who  serves  the  entire  anniversary year; in  such  a case the  individual must earn 50 points to  collect  the final  month of FLPB prior to separation. 4.2.  FLPB Eligibility.  FLPB eligibility is based upon awarded AFSC, current duty assignment, participation  in  specific  programs  (e.g.,  Language  Enabled  Airman  Program,  Overseas Development Education, Olmsted Scholar, etc.) and/or the designation of the language on the AF SLL.    The  following  paragraphs  provide  specific  information  for  individual  eligibility  and administrative  procedures  to  qualify  for  and  receive  FLPB.    Airmen  are  instructed  to  find  the category below that applies to their current duty assignments to determine FLPB eligibility and payment. 4.3.  Cryptologic Language Analysts (CLAs).  CLAs are authorized FLPB at the Enhancement Rate with  proficiency  2/2  and higher for their CLANG(s).   For the purposes of  FLPB, CLA is defined  as  any  Enlisted  Airman  who  has  been  awarded  and  maintains  the  AFSCs  1N3X1X  or 1A8X1X. 4.3.1.  For CLAs, a CLANG is defined for purposes of FLPB as: 4.3.1.1.  Any language acquired through graduation from the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center (DLIFLC) or other DoD-funded training course of comparable length  and  content  to  a  DLIFLC  initial  acquisition  course  with  a  graduation  or  course completion  minimum  requirement  of  2/2/1+,  or  DoD-funded  language  enhancement training designed to increase DLPT scores by a half level (from 2 to 2+ or from 2+ to 3); or 4.3.1.2.  A  language  for  which  an  Airman  has  been  awarded  a  1A8X1X  or  1N3X1X AFSC by the appropriate CFM. 4.3.2.  CLAs serving in a special duty with a Special Duty Identifier or Reporting Identifier differing from their AFSC are authorized FLPB at the Enhancement Rate at proficiency 2/2 and  higher  for  their  CLA  CLANG.    Example:  An  Airman  whose  AFSC  is  1N3X1X  and whose  CLANG  is  Spanish,  but  is  serving  as  an  8P000  in  a  position  that  does  not  have  a language  assigned  to  it  will  still  be  eligible  to  receive  FLPB  at  the  Enhancement  Rate  for Spanish at 2/2 or higher, even though Spanish is a PIF language.  This will remain in effect for as long as all other eligibility and certification requirements are met.   14  AFI36-4002  16 JUNE 2015 4.3.3.  CLAs  assigned  to  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command  (AFSOC),  United  States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), or Afghanistan-Pakistan  Hands  (AFPAK  Hands)  are  not  eligible  to  receive  sub-2/2  FLPB  for their CLANG(s) and must achieve a minimum of 2/2 qualifying score for FLPB. 4.3.4.  CLAs  who  test  in  multiple  languages  must  provide  documentation  verifying  official training, (examples include, but are not limited to: a DLIFLC training certificate, Verification of  Military  Experience  and  Training  (VMET)  printout,  or  other  proof  of  training  for  each language as verified by Member’s Command Language Program Manager). 4.3.5.  CLAs  who  test  in  only  one  language  and  who  meet  the  eligibility  requirements outlined in section 4.3, Cryptologic Language Analysts will continue to receive FLPB at the Enhancement Rate with no additional proof of training. 4.3.6.  Airmen  who  have  been  awarded  a  1A800  or  1N000  AFSC  and  were  previously awarded  a  1A8X1X  or  1N3X1X  as  their  primary  AFSC,  are  authorized  FLPB  at  the Enhancement Rate at proficiency 2/2 and higher for their CLANG(s) as outlined in 4.3. and its sub-paragraphs. 4.3.7.  The following examples may be used in Block V of IMT 2096, Remarks: 4.3.7.1.  AF  IMT  2096  –  CLA  example:    Member’s  AFSC  is  __________.    (Tested language) is/is not member's CLANG.

For Exchange Program participants, a CLANG is the language for which the Airman was selected for participation. 4.14.2.  Language  proficiency  testing  must  be  current  upon  departure  for  the  exchange program’s foreign location. 4.14.3.  Qualifying  Airmen  are  authorized  FLPB  payment  effective  the  start  date  of  their exchange program participation through the completion date. 4.14.4.  To maintain accurate FLPB accountability, Regional Air Force Elements (AFELM) shall  provide a quarterly roster of eligible participating Airmen and their CLANG to AFPC and AF LREC Office. 4.14.5.  The following example may be used in Block V of IMT 2096, Remarks: 4.14.5.1.  IMT 2096 – Exchange Program Participants example: Member is an Exchange Program  Participant  in  (program  name).    The  language  required  for  which  the  member was accepted as an Exchange Program Participant is (language). 4.15.  All  Others.  All  other  FLPB  eligibilities  not  authorized  under  any  of  the  previous categories are authorized FLPB for proficiency levels 2/2 and higher for all non-PIF languages in accordance with where the language appears on the AF SLL. 4.15.1.  FLPB is  not  authorized for PIF-designated languages, unless covered by any of the previous categories or paragraph 4.16, Ad-Hoc FLPB. 4.15.2.  Airmen with a 1C1 AFSC with the SEI 055 are authorized FLPB for Spanish at the Enhancement Rate at proficiency level 2/2 and higher. 4.16.  Ad-Hoc  FLPB.  Airmen  called  upon  to  use  their  foreign  language  skills  in  ad-hoc situations are eligible for FLPB at the Enhancement Rate under certain conditions. 4.16.1.  Ad-hoc  situations  include  emergency,  unplanned,  or  contingency  operations  where an Airman’s foreign language skill is required to support the mission.  Rotational or regularly planned deployments do not constitute an ad-hoc situation.  Use of language skill, including PIF  languages,  during  execution  of  regularly  assigned  duties  does  not  constitute  an  ad-hoc use of language skills and billets should be coded to include required language skills.   20  AFI36-4002  16 JUNE 2015 4.16.2.  To be eligible, Airmen must achieve a minimum qualifying score of 1/1 on the DLPT or OPI.  If no DLPT is available in the language(s) used for the ad-hoc situation the OPI may be entered into the listening in order to meet the two-modality requirement. 4.16.3.  Airmen without a current test in the language(s) used must be tested via the DLPT or OPI system within 90 days of the end of the operational deployment in which their language skill  was required.  Ad-hoc FLPB is  not  intended to  replace the need to  properly designate billets that have language requirements. 4.16.4.  For ad-hoc requests, FLPB will be paid  in a lump sum, upon completion of the ad-hoc situation, based on the length of time the language was used.  Following completion of the ad-hoc situation and receipt of scores, the Airmen’s commanding officer shall forward an Ad-Hoc  FLPB  Request  in  the  form  of  an  ETP  (See  procedures  outlined  in  Chapter  5).  NOTE:  A separate memorandum is required for each member. AFI36-4002  16 JUNE 2015   21  Chapter 5 EXCEPTIONS TO POLICY  5.1.  Exceptions to Policy.
