The DoD Health Benefits Program (DoD HBP) is a uniform health insurance program available to eligible Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) employees, retirees, and their family members.    The  DoD  HBP  consists  of  the  Preferred  Provider  Organization  (PPO)  Network  and Traditional-Indemnity  Medical  Plans,  the  DoD  HBP  Dental  Plan,  and  the  Stand  Alone  Dental (SAD)  Plan.    Plan  participants  living  in  the  Continental  U.S.  access  medical  care  through  the PPO  Network  Plan  or  the  Traditional-Indemnity  Plan,  depending  on  their  geographic  location.  Plan participants residing overseas use the Traditional-Indemnity Medical Plan.  Dental coverage is  offered to  participants  through the DoD HBP Dental Plan or the SAD Plan.  The SAD is  an insured  product,  procured  separately  by  the  DoD  HBP  Committee.  Under  an  insured arrangement,  the  Carrier  assumes  all  the  risk  and  claim  liability.    The  DoD  HBP  medical  and dental  plans  are  self-  insured.    This  means  they  provide  benefits  without  the  purchase  of commercial  insurance.    In  this  case,  a  third-party  administrator  provides  access  to  networks  of health and dental care providers and services, and also performs claims administration services.  Under the self-insured  arrangement,  the Air  Force pays its pro-rata share  of administrative and claim-payment expenses using the employee and employer contributions  deposited into the Air Force Insurance Fund (AFIF).  Participation in the program is voluntary. 1.2.  Purpose.  The DoD HBP provides an efficient way for employees and retirees to maintain a measure of security for themselves and their family members in the event of illness or injury. 1.3.  Obtaining Information and Program Documents. 1.3.1.  Nonappropriated  Fund  Human  Resources  (NAF-HR)  Sections  should  forward technical  questions,  requests  for  additional  supplies  and  information,  and  comments pertaining to the management and administration of the DoD HBP to the Air Force Services Activity (AFSVA) Insurance Section (SVXHI).  (T-2) 1.3.2.  Direct  inquiries  related  to  the  status  or  payment  of  claims,  pre-certification procedures,  and  covered  medical  and  dental  expenses  to  the  Carrier  at  the  toll-free  number listed  on  the  covered  participant’s  identification  card  or  online  through  the  Carrier's Customer Service Website. 1.3.3.  Applicable Documents: 1.3.3.1.  The Summary Plan Description (SPD) refers to the applicable health and dental benefits  information  booklet  related  to  eligibility,  covered  and  excluded  benefits, coordination  of  benefits,  continuing  coverage  programs,  and  other  plan-related information.    If  an  employee  enrolls  in  health  coverage  under  the  DoD  HBP,  the applicable SPD depends on the medical plan type offered by geographical location, either the  PPO  or  the  Traditional-Indemnity  Plan.    Separate  SPDs  apply  to  dental  coverage under the DoD HBP and the SAD plans. 1.3.3.2.  Flexible  Benefits  Plan  (FBP)  Documents.    The  FBP  gives  NAF  employees enrolled  in  the  DoD  HBP  or  the  SAD  the  option  to  pay  contributions  with  pre-tax earnings.  NAF-HR Sections and FBP participants coordinate plan enrollments, changes, and cancellations using AFI 34-307, NAF Flexible Benefits Plan.   6  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 1.3.3.3.  DoD  HBP  Policy  Document.    For  DoD  HBP  policy  guidance,  refer  to  DoDI 1400.25, V1408, DoD Civilian Personnel Management System: Insurance and Annuities for Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Employees. AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   7  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  DoD NAF Employee Benefits Committee reviews DoD HBP matters and develops policy recommendations for DoD consideration, recommends the kinds and levels of benefits the DoD NAF  HBP shall provide based upon such factors as cost, mainstream  private and public sector practice, and health benefits as an element of the total compensation package necessary to recruit and  retain  productive  employees.  The  Committee  is  chaired  by  a  member  of  the  Defense Civilian  Personnel  Advisory  Service  (DCPAS)  Nonappropriated  Fund  (NAF)  Personnel  Policy Division  and  is  composed  of  representatives  from  that  division  and  members  the  DoD  NAF Components. 2.2.  Air  Force  Services  Activity  (AFSVA)  provides  general  oversight,  management,  day-to-day  administration  of  the  DoD  HBP,  its  continuing  coverage  program,  and  publishes instructional  material.  An  AFSVA  representative  is  a  member  of  the  DoD  HBP  Employee Benefits Committee. 2.3.  Installation  NAF-HR  Section  performs  routine  installation-level  administration  as instructed  in  this  AFI,  the  DoD  HBP  Policy,  applicable  SPD,  and  administrative  guidance provided by the AFSVA/SVXHI or Carrier.  (T-0) 2.4.  AFSVA  Shared  Service  Center  (SSC)  Payroll  Branch  processes  the  collection  of employee  and  employer  contributions  associated  with  plan  participation  as  instructed  by  AF Services Financial Management System (AFSFMS) payroll procedures. 2.5.  The Carrier will: 2.5.1.  Perform  tasks  concerning  administration  of  the  PPO  Network  and  Traditional-Indemnity Medical Plans, the DoD HBP Dental Plan, and the SAD. 2.5.2.  Provide  customer  service  functions;  administer  and  pay  claims;  and  provide information and assistance on premium setting and reserve funding. 2.5.3.  Provide  expert  advice  on  health  and  dental  benefits  management  matters;  establish SPD content and publish and distribute SPDs. 2.5.4.  Develop  and  supply  employee  communications;  provide  administrative  assistance during the Open Enrollment Period; maintain participant information; and provide evaluation reports on medical and dental plans.   8  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 Chapter 3 NAF-HR  3.1.  Determine  Eligibility  for  Participation.  Employees,  retirees,  and  their  eligible  family members  may  not  be  excluded  from  coverage  because  of  a  pre-existing  condition.    The requirements  below,  and  those  listed  in  the  SPDs,  establish  the  eligibility  criteria  for participation in medical and dental coverage under the DoD HBP or the SAD.  Medical coverage is offered to employees through a PPO network Plan or a Traditional-Indemnity Plan, depending on the person’s geographic location.  (For retirees, the medical plan offered depends on the place of  residence  or  eligibility  for  Medicare.)    Dental  coverage  is  optional.    Employees  who  elect dental coverage have two enrollment options: either they may enroll in the DoD HBP dental plan or  they  may  enroll  in  the  SAD  only.    Retirees  may  continue  their  DoD  HBP  dental  coverage associated  with  their  DoD  HBP  medical  plan,  if  upon  retirement,  they  meet  the  enrollment requirements.  Otherwise, retirees are not eligible for the SAD Plan.  Employees are not required to participate in a separate benefit program, such as life insurance, to be eligible for DoD HBP coverage.    EXCEPTION:    If  employees  want  DoD  HBP  medical  and  dental  coverage  upon retirement  (i.e.,  Post-Retirement  Medical  (PRM)  coverage),  they  must  be  enrolled  in  a Retirement  Plan  and  be  eligible  for  an  immediate  annuity.    Employees  not  participating  in  a Retirement Plan, do not qualify for retiree PRM coverage. 3.1.1.  Active Employees. 3.1.1.1.  Regular  civilian  NAF  employees  are  eligible  if  they  are  scheduled  to  work  at least  20  hours  per  week,  are  employed  on  the  US  dollar  payroll,  have  a  social  security number or individual tax identification number, and are subject to US income tax. 3.1.1.2.  Eligibility  Following  Employee  Move  from  Appropriated  Fund  (APF)  Position to a NAF Position (Portability Move).  Health insurance is not portable, regardless of an employee’s  retirement  system  election.    APF  employees  moved  to  NAF  positions (whether involuntary or voluntary) may elect to enroll in the DoD HBP within 31 days of appointment to  a NAF position. They may not  remain in  the Federal  Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program.  Contact AFSVA/SVXHI for special guidance on processing a portability-related enrollment under the DoD HBP. 3.1.2.  Former Employee/Retirees. 3.1.2.1.  Eligibility  for  Post-Retirement  Medical  (PRM)  and  Dental  Coverage.    Former employees/retirees are  eligible to  continue participation in  the DoD HBP, excluding the SAD.  Notify  the  AFSVA  Insurance  Branch  of  former  employees/retirees  eligible  for PRM  coverage  within  31  days  of  the  eligibility  date.    Former  employees/retirees  must meet all of the following requirements. 3.1.2.1.1.  Enrollment.    Employees  must  be  enrolled  in  the  DoD  HBP  medical  plan (and  DoD  HBP  dental  plan,  if  applicable)  on  the  day  before  termination  of employment. 3.1.2.1.2.  Participation.  Have 15 years cumulative participation in any combination of  NAF  employer  health  plans  existing  before  1  January  2000,  and  the  DoD  HBP AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   9  medical  and  dental  plans.    Participation  in  either  the  health  or  dental  plan  does  not have to be continuous and is not affected by breaks in service. 3.1.2.1.2.1.  Credit  for  Federal  Employees  Health  Benefits  (FEHB)  Program Participation. Continuous participation in the FEHB Program as of the day before a  move  from  an  APF  position  to  a  NAF  position,  on  or  after  1  January  1987, without  a  break  in  service  of  more  than  3  days,  will  be  credited  towards  the  15 year cumulative participation requirement. 3.1.2.1.2.2.  Circumstances Allowing Waivers of 15 Years Participation. 3.1.2.1.2.2.1.  Involuntary  Movement  from  an  APF  Position  to  a  NAF Position.  The  health  and  dental  plan  requirement  for  15  years  cumulative participation  is  waived  for  employees  who  had  5  years  of  continuous enrollment in the FEHB Program on the day before being involuntarily moved from an APF position to a NAF position.  The move must have occurred on or after 1 January 1987, without a break in service of more than 3 days.  In this circumstance, an involuntary move occurs when the employee’s APF position is  abolished  in  the  APF  employment  system  and  reestablished  in  the  NAF employment system. 3.1.2.1.2.2.2.  Movement from an APF Position to a NAF Positions under the Uniform  Funding  and  Management  (UFM)  Program.    The  health  and  dental plan  requirement  for  15  years  cumulative  participation  is  waived  for employees  who  had  5  years  of  continuous  enrollment  in  the  FEHB  Program on the day before moving from an APF position to a NAF position under the UFM  authority  granted  by  Section  2494  of  10  U.S.C.  (Reference  (m)).    The employee  must  have  been  the  incumbent  of  a  position  that  the  employer moved  from  APF  to  NAF  under  the  UFM  funding  authority  and  must  have moved between the positions without a break in  service of more than 1  day.  The  NAF  Components  are  required  to  document  waivers  of  the  15-year participation  requirement  for  the  purpose  of  UFM  and  be  prepared  to  report this  information  to  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  as  requested. (SC1408.AP1.5.2.1.2.2.2.) 3.1.2.1.2.2.3.  Participation in a NAF Employer Dental Plan prior to 1 January 2000.    The  requirement  for  15  years  cumulative  participation  in  the  dental plan  is  waived  for  employees  who  participated  in  a  NAF  employer’s  dental plan when the NAF employer first offered it prior to 1 January 2000, and who have continuously participated in the DoD HBP dental plan. 3.1.2.1.3.  Retirement  Annuity.   Former  employees/retirees  must  receive  an immediate NAF annuity by a monthly annuity check or a lump-sum annuity payment.  The  annuity  may  also  be  from  the  Civil  Service  Retirement  System  (CSRS)  or Federal  Employees  Retirement  System  (FERS),  provided  the  employee  elected  to remain covered by CSRS or FERS as a NAF employee. 3.1.2.2.  Post-Retirement  Medical/Dental  Coverage  Election  and  Termination.    Group medical/dental  coverage  terminates  if  a  former  employee  separates  from  NAF employment  and  does  not  initially  elect  post-retirement  coverage  within  31  days  of  the   10  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 required  premiums, terminates. eligibility  date.    If  a  retiree  cancels  post-retirement  coverage  for  any  reason,  or  fails  to pay   A  former employee/retiree may not have post-retirement medical or dental coverage reinstated, or re-enroll in either coverage during subsequent Open Enrollment Periods. the  post-retirement  coverage 3.1.2.3.  TRICARE-for-Life.  Medicare-eligible retirees, including surviving dependents, may  suspend  their  DoD  HBP  medical  coverage  for  enrollment  in  TRICARE-for-Life.  TRICARE-for-Life retirees or surviving dependents  must also  suspend their dental plan participation,  if  covered  by  the  DoD  HBP  Dental  Plan.    Those  who  involuntarily  lose TRICARE-for-Life  may  return  to  DoD  HBP  health  and  dental  (if  applicable)  coverage immediately.    Otherwise,  the  retiree  or  surviving  dependent  may  do  so  during  the  next Open Enrollment Period. 3.1.3.  Dependents.    Employees  who  enroll  in  the  DoD  HBP  or  the  SAD  may  also  elect  to cover their eligible dependents.  Parents of covered employees are not eligible.  Refer to the appropriate medical or dental SPD for additional details on eligibility criteria for dependents. 3.1.3.1.

The  NAF-HR  Section  will  provide  advice  and  assistance  to employees  and  retirees  on  the  provisions  of  the  DoD  NAF  HBP,  including  distributing communication materials and assisting in proper completion of applicable forms. (T-0) 3.2.1.  Plan  Provisions.    Describe  the  plan  provisions  in  the  applicable  SPD  and  answer related  questions  so  employees  can  make  an  informed  decision  about  enrolling  in  health benefits.  Employees may voluntarily enroll in the DoD HBP or SAD.

Payroll deductions start at the beginning of the pay period in which the coverage is effective. 3.2.2.2.  SAD  Plan.    Follow  the  same  enrollment  rules  as  with  the  PPO  Network  and Traditional-Indemnity Plans unless otherwise directed. 3.2.3.  Contribution Rates. 3.2.3.1.  The  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Civilian  Personnel  Policy approves and announces contribution rates for the DoD HBP to the Service Component heads  of  NAF  Employers  each  year,  based  on  recommendations  from  the  DoD  HBP Committee.    The  Committee  reviews  plan  provisions  and  claims  utilization  reports provided  by recommendation.  AFSVA/SVXHI forwards approved rates to installation NAF-HR Sections, the SSC, and other AFSVA functional offices for implementation. to  determine its  proposed the  Carrier rates 3.2.3.2.

Employees enrolled in FBP may not cancel their DoD HBP or SAD coverage until they change their FBP  election to “after-tax” during the Open Enrollment Period.  Refer to  Attachment 2 (Qualifying Events for Changing a FBP Election) in AFI 34- 307, NAF Flexible Benefits Plan, for more information. 3.2.6.  Precertification or Advance Claim Review Provisions.  These provisions are explained in more detail in the medical and dental SPDs.  Plan participants must obtain precertification from  the Carrier  for  certain  types of healthcare services identified in  the  applicable SPD to avoid a reduction in benefits. 3.2.7.  Continuation  of  Coverage.    Refer  to  the  appropriate  section  of  this  AFI  and  SPD  to counsel  employees  on  continuation  of  coverage  based  on  the  circumstance  under  which  an employee  or  dependent  would  lose  eligibility  for  group  insurance.    Notify  the  AFSVA Insurance Branch of employees eligible for continuing coverage within 31 days of the date of eligibility. 3.2.8.  Conversion of Health Benefits Coverage.  Employees, retirees, and dependents losing DoD  HBP  medical  coverage  may  convert,  without  a  medical  exam,  to  a  personal  health policy  offered  by  the  Carrier.    If  an  enrollee  resides  overseas,  the  person  may  not  convert unless  he  or  she  returns  to  the  US  within  31  days  from  the  date  that  coverage  under  the   12  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 medical plan ceases. The personal policy will take effect on the day after DoD HBP medical coverage ceases, or any  Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) ends.  The DoD HBP medical  SPD  provides  detailed  application  requirements,  including  specific  time  periods during which a participant may apply.  The conversion provision does not apply to DoD HBP Dental or SAD coverage. 3.3.  Processing  Waivers  of  Enrollment.  If  an  employee  initially  declines  coverage,  have  the employee complete and sign a waiver of health and/or dental coverage card and file the card in the employee’s Official Personnel File (OPF).  The NAF-HR Section will document the waiver on an AF Form 2545, NAFI Notification of Personnel Action, in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS).  The employee may not  enroll in the plan until an Open Enrollment or Special Enrollment Period.  Refer to DoD HBP Policy and the SPD regarding special enrollment periods. (T-2) 3.4.  Processing  Enrollment  Elections.  The  NAF-HR  Section  will  enroll  eligible  employees and dependents electing to participate in the plan and determine their effective date of coverage for payroll deductions, as instructed below.  The NAF-HR Section will use the AF Form 2545 to notify the SSC of an employee’s plan election and other plan-related information. (T-2) 3.4.1.  If  an  employee  requests  coverage  within  31  days  of  hire  or  reclassification  to  an eligible employment category, the employee/NAF-HR Section must complete an enrollment form.    Make  a  copy  of  the  employee’s  enrollment  form  for  suspense  (see  paragraph  3.4.5. below)  and  forward  the  original  form  to  the  Carrier  Eligibility  Unit  as  instructed  by AFSVA/SVXHI. 3.4.2.  Process  an  AF  Form  2545  using the  applicable  plan  code  provided  by AFSVA/SVXHI.    The  effective  date  of  coverage  is  the  day  the  employee  completes  and signs the enrollment form  and returns it to  the NAF-HR Section.  Payroll deductions begin with the first day of the pay period during which coverage becomes effective. 3.4.3.  Employees who do not  enroll in  the DoD  HBP or SAD within the 31-day  eligibility period must wait to enroll during the next Open Enrollment Period or, if applicable, during a Special Enrollment Period. 3.4.4.  After processing an employee’s enrollment form, the Carrier will send a change form to  the  NAF-HR  Section  documenting  the  employee’s  benefit  election.    The  change  form  is filed  in  the  envelope  on  the  right  side  of  the  employee’s  OPF  and  used  later  to  notify  the Carrier  of  an  employee’s  cancellation  or  change  in  coverage.    The  NAF-HR  Section  will temporarily  suspend  the  employee’s  enrollment  form,  pending  receipt  of  the  change  form from the Carrier.  If a change form is not received within 2 to 3 weeks, the NAF-HR Section will  follow-up  with  the  Carrier  to  check  the  status.    Afterwards,  the  NAF-HR  Section  files the employee’s enrollment form and change form in the OPF. 3.5.  Processing Changes in Coverage.  The NAF-HR Section will use AF Form 2545 to notify the SSC of an employee’s change in coverage or cancellation, and also process the change form through the Carrier according to the AFSVA/SVXHI pre-established procedures. (T-2) 3.5.1.  Cancelling or Terminating Coverage.  Coverage ends on the date the employee signs the  required  cancellation  form,  or  on  the  date  the  employee  terminates  employment,  or changes to an ineligible category.  An employee does not pay an insurance contribution in the pay period during which the cancellation of coverage occurs. AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   13  3.5.1.1.  To cancel coverage at an employee’s request, the employee completes and signs a discontinuance of coverage card, which is filed in the employee’s OPF. 3.5.1.2.  Special Considerations for Total Disability.  If an employee declares disability at the time group coverage ends, refer to the DoD HBP SPD to determine if the employee is eligible for continued coverage.  Advise individuals who are potentially eligible for TCC disability coverage to: 3.5.1.2.1.  Obtain a physician’s statement as proof of total disability and the prognosis of  the  disability.    Acceptable  forms  of  evidence  for  total  disability  include  a  letter from  the  person’s  attending  physician,  or  the  Social  Security  Administration,  or  a completed medical benefits request claim form. 3.5.1.2.2.  Send Disability-TCC request documentation through the NAF-HR Section to AFSVA/SVXHI. 3.5.1.2.3.  AFSVA/SVXHI  will  review  the  information,  determine  eligibility  for Disability-TCC provisions, and enroll the disabled employee or family member(s) in the appropriate TCC Program option. 3.5.2.  Increasing  or  Decreasing  Coverage.    Depending  on  circumstances,  employees  may change coverage at any time during the plan year, provided they have not elected to pay their insurance contributions with pre-tax earnings under the Flexible Benefits Plan (FBP).  If the employee  requesting  the  change  is  enrolled  in  the  FBP,  refer  to  Attachment  2  (Qualifying Events  for  Changing  a  FBP  Election)  in  AFI  34-307,  NAF  Flexible  Benefits  Plan,  on  the qualifying events (restrictions) for making a change.  Changes must be made within 31 days of the life-qualifying event, e.g., birth of child, marriage, etc. 3.5.2.1.  An  employee  enrolled  in  single  coverage  may  add  a  newly  eligible  dependent within 31 days of the dependent’s eligibility date.  The effective date of family coverage is  either  the  date  of  the  election  or  the  date  of  the  event.    The  premium  increase  is effective the first day of the pay period during which the change in coverage occurred. 3.5.2.2.  Employees may change from family to single coverage (or medical and dental to medical-only) at any time during the plan year, unless they are paying contributions with pre-tax earnings under the FBP as described earlier in this section. 3.5.3.  Processing  Name  or  Address  Changes.    Use  AF  Form  2545  to  notify  the  SSC  of employee  personal  data  changes.    The  NAF-HR  Section  will  verify  name  change  using applicable  legal  documentation  and  file  the  information  in  the  employee’s  OPF.    Follow AFSVA/SVXHI  instructions  for  notifying  the  Carrier  Eligibility  Unit  of  the  employee change. 3.6.  Processing Transfer Actions.  The NAF-HR Section determines if a transferring employee meets  the  eligibility  criteria  to  continue  participation  in  health/dental  coverage  under  the  DoD HBP/SAD at the gaining installation. (T-2) 3.6.1.  Processing  Name  or  Address  Changes.    If  an  enrolled  employee  transfers  without  a break in service, coverage continues without interruption and the employee is not subject to the  31day  eligibility  period  for  enrollment  purposes.    The  transfer  AF  Form  2545  should reflect  continuing  health/dental  coverage  if  the  employee  had  it  at  his  or  her  previous  duty station.   14  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 3.6.1.1.  PPO Network and Traditional-Indemnity Plans.  Enter the gaining installation’s control-suffix-account  number  (group  policy  number),  the  effective  date  of  the  transfer, and the employee’s DoD HBP/SAD plan number and home address on the change form and forward it to the Carrier Eligibility Unit.  Notify the SSC of the insurance enrollment action  using  AF  Form  2545  to  start  (resume)  payroll  deductions.    File  copies  of  the change form and personnel action in the employee’s OPF. 3.6.1.2.  If  unable  to  locate  the  employee’s  change  form  in  the  OPF,  use  an  enrollment form to report the transfer to the Carrier.  The NAF-HR Section may need to enroll the employee in a different medical plan option (plan number) due to the geographic move.  The employee should be given relevant enrollment materials and the matching SPD. 3.6.1.3.  Transfer  between  NAF  Instrumentalities  (NAFIs).    If  the  termination  of employment  from  the  losing  installation  and  subsequent  employment  with  the  gaining installation occur in two different but successive pay periods, a full premium payment is made for each pay period at the respective installation. 3.6.1.4.  If  the  termination  of  employment  from  the  losing  installation  and  subsequent employment  with  the  gaining  installation  occur  in  the  same  pay  period,  a  full  premium payment  for  the  pay  period  is  made  by  the  gaining  installation.    If  both  installations deduct premiums, the losing installation should refund the erroneous premium deductions to the employee and gaining installation. 3.6.2.  If  an  enrolled  employee  transfers  with  a  break  in  service  of  one  or  more  workdays, determine if the employee is eligible for the DoD HBP/SAD at the gaining installation.  If the employee is not eligible to continue participation in the DoD HBP/SAD, complete the change form to cancel coverage and send it to the Carrier Eligibility Unit.  File a copy of the change form in the employee’s OPF. 3.6.3.  The NAF-HR Section notifies the SSC of the insurance cancellation action using AF Form 2545.  This action will stop payroll deductions. 3.7.  Performing Routine Insurance Audits/Reconciling Reports.  (T-2) 3.7.1.  The NAF-HR Section will routinely audit monthly reports from  the Carrier to ensure enrollment,  change,  and  cancellation its eligibility/claims  systems.    The  monthly  report  from  the  Carrier  should  match  the information in DCPDS. transactions  are  correctly  documented in 3.7.1.1.  Correct  errors  by  sending  the  Carrier  a  copy  of  the  enrollment  form  or  a corrected copy of the change form for each affected employee and suspense a copy of the form for follow-up with the Carrier in 2 to 3 weeks.  The Carrier will send a new change form  to  the NAF-HR Section documenting the employee’s insurance election under the DoD HBP/SAD.  The NAF-HR Section files the form  in  the OPF after reviewing it for accuracy.  If an employee’s change form is not received within the suspense time, contact the Carrier and determine the status. 3.7.1.2.  The  NAF-HR  Section  will  also  reconcile  the  biweekly  group  insurance enrollment/payroll  deduction  report  generated  by  the  SSC  with  health/dental  insurance-related  actions  submitted  on  AF  Forms  2545,  and  take  corrective  action  in  DCPDS  or through  the  SSC  or  the  Carrier,  as  required.    For  example,  the  NAF-HR  Section  will AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   15  verify each pay period that employees’ payroll deductions correspond with their benefit elections  using  a  detailed  group  insurance  enrollment/deduction  report.    The  payroll report should match the enrollment data in DCPDS and the Carrier report.  The NAF-HR Section corrects errors in DCPDS and notifies or coordinates with the SSC or the Carrier for resolution accordingly. 3.8.  Employee Contribution Shortages.  The NAF-HR Section coordinates with the SSC using whatever means available to immediately inform an employee when pay is insufficient to cover his or her health/dental contributions. (T-2)  In addition, the NAF-HR Section will: 3.8.1.  Instruct  the  employee  to  pay  the  shortage  by  the  next  pay  period  following  the  pay period in which the shortage occurred. 3.8.2.  Notify  the  SSC  when  the  employee  failed  to  timely  pay  the  shortage  as  instructed.  The NAF-HR Section also notifies the employee and Carrier that coverage is canceled. 3.8.2.1.  Process  an  AF  Form  2545  to  notify  the  SSC  of  the  employee’s  cancellation  of group health/dental coverage. 3.8.2.2.  The NAF-HR Section also completes the change form to cancel the employee’s coverage  through  the  Carrier  Eligibility  Unit.    The  effective  date  of  cancellation  is  the first  day  of  the  pay  period  immediately  following  the  pay  period  in  which  the  shortage occurred.  The NAF-HR Section files copies of both forms in the employee’s OPF. 3.8.3.  Losing  Coverage.    Any  employee  losing  group  coverage  due  to  the  nonpayment  of contributions is not eligible for continuing coverage and may not re-enroll in the DoD HBP or  SAD  Plan  until  the  Open  Enrollment  Period  unless  he  or  she  qualifies  for  a  Special Enrollment Period due to a life-changing event. 3.8.4.  Otherwise,  as  long  as  employees  continue  to  pay  their  share  of  the  contribution,  the NAFI  continues  to  pay  the  employer  share.    Exception:    The  SAD  Plan  is  100  percent employee-paid.  Coverage remains in effect as long as the respective shares are paid.   16  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 Chapter 4 ENROLLMENT OPPORTUNITIES 4.1.  Initial  Enrollment  of  Active  Employees.  Eligible employees may  enroll themselves  and eligible dependents in the DoD HBP or SAD within 31 days of the employee’s initial eligibility date.  Employees not  enrolling during this initial eligibility period must  wait to  enroll during a subsequent Open Enrollment Period or during a Special Enrollment Period. 4.2.  Open  Enrollment  Period  for  Employees.  AFSVA/SVXHI  will  announce  an  Open Enrollment  Period  for  eligible  employees.    Employee  elections  are  effective  1  January  of  the following  year.    Retirees  and  surviving  dependents  are  not  allowed  to  enroll  during  Open Enrollment Periods, with the exception of those who suspended DoD HBP coverage to enroll in TRICARE-for-Life.  During an Open Enrollment Period: 4.2.1.  Eligible employees and their eligible dependents not already participating in the DoD HBP may enroll in either the DoD HBP or the SAD at this time. 4.2.2.  Employees  who  are  already  enrolled  in  medical  coverage  under  the  DoD  HBP  may elect to add DoD HBP dental coverage; or they may drop their DoD HBP medical (and DoD HBP dental, if applicable) coverage altogether to enroll in SAD coverage only. 4.2.3.  Employees enrolled in single coverage may change to family coverage, and vice versa. 4.2.4.  Eligible employees and retirees living in areas covered by the Traditional- Indemnity Plan may opt into the PPO Network Plan that covers a nearby area, or reverse an earlier such decision and opt back into the Traditional-Indemnity Plan. 4.3.  Enrollment of Medicare-Eligible Retirees. 4.3.1.  Retirees  living  in  a  PPO  network  area  who  are  eligible  for  Medicare  due  to  age  or disability,  and  have  a  covered  dependent(s)  not  eligible  for  Medicare,  may  change  their current medical coverage during the Open Enrollment Period under either the PPO Network Plan or Traditional-Indemnity Plan.  The election is effective 1 January of the following year. 4.3.2.  They may also make this election if they move from an area not covered by the PPO Network Plan to one that is.  The election is effective 31 days after the move. 4.3.3.  At this point, there is no further option to elect the PPO Network Plan. 4.4.  Enrollment of Dependents. 4.4.1.  Optional  Dependent  Enrollment.    Employees  may  elect  family  coverage  and  cover eligible  dependents  under  the  DoD  HBP,  or  SAD  Plan,  within  31  days  of  the  employee’s initial eligibility date. 4.4.2.  Employees  and  retirees  already  enrolled  in  the  DoD  HBP  may  move  from  single  to family coverage, or add a new dependent to their existing family coverage, within 31 days of a change in family status, e.g., marriage, birth or adoption.  This also applies to the SAD Plan with the following exception:  retirees are not eligible for SAD. 4.4.2.1.  An employee’s  failure to  change to  family coverage or add a dependent  within the 31-day eligibility period will require the employee to wait to increase coverage until the next Open Enrollment Period or a Special Enrollment Period. AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   17  4.4.2.2.  Retirees  or  surviving  dependents  are  not  eligible  for  Open  Enrollment  Periods, with the exception of those who suspended DoD HBP coverage to enroll in TRICARE- for-Life. Retirees who fail to enroll a newly eligible dependent within 31 days following a  change  in  family  status  are  eligible  to  add  the  dependent  only  after  a  life-changing event covered by Special Enrollment Period rules; e.g., a change in family status, or the dependent’s loss of other health insurance coverage. 4.4.2.3.  If the surviving spouse remarries, neither the new spouse or any new dependents acquired by the remarriage are eligible for the DoD HBP. 4.5.  Required Dependent Enrollment Based  on a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO). 4.5.1.  DoD  HBP  will  honor  a  court-issued  QMCSO  requiring  an  eligible  employee  or enrolled  retiree  to  provide  health  coverage  for  dependents  if  they  meet  the  DoD  HBP definition of an eligible dependent.  Coverage level under the plan is mandated by the terms of  the  court  order.    If  an  enrolled  employee  or  retiree  fails  or  refuses  to  enroll  an  eligible child  as  required  by  the  QMCSO,  the  NAF-HR  Section  will  automatically  enroll  them  in family  coverage.    AFSVA/SVXHI  will  handle  QMCSOs  served  on  enrolled  retirees.    This health provision does not apply to retirees not already enrolled in the DoD HBP. 4.5.2.  SAD  Plan.    The  SAD  Plan  will  also  honor  a  court-issued  QMCSO  requiring  an eligible  employee  to  provide  dental  coverage  for  eligible  dependents.    Follow  the  same procedures  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4.5.1.    This  dental  provision  does  not  apply  to  retirees since  they  are  not  eligible  for  SAD  coverage.    EXCEPTION:    If  the  court  order  states “health”  or  “medical”  coverage  and  the  employee  is  enrolled  in  SAD,  then  the  employee must  cancel  the  SAD  coverage  and  enroll  in  the  DoD  HBP.    In  this  case,  the  court  order overrules enrollment procedures outlined in this AFI. 4.5.3.  If the employee named in the QMCSO is eligible, but is not enrolled in the DoD HBP, upon  coordination  with  the  AFSVA  Services  Legal  Office  (AFSVA/JA),  AFSVA/SVXHI, and the NAF-HR Section, the employee will enroll in the required coverage as ordered by the court.    Coverage  is  effective  on  the  date  of  the  court  order  unless  determined  otherwise  by the Chief, AFSVA/SVXHI. 4.6.  Special Enrollment Rules. 4.6.1.  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)  Special  Enrollment Periods.  As  required  by  HIPAA,  employees  and  dependents  which  decline  enrollment because of other health insurance coverage may, if eligibility requirements are met, enroll in the  DoD  HBP  within  31  days  of  the  end  of  the  other  health  plan  coverage.    Participating employees  and  retirees  may  also  enroll  eligible  spouses  and  dependents  acquired  through marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption within 31 days of the qualifying event.  Employees  may  enroll  themselves  in  family  coverage  in  order  to  cover  new  dependents  or provide coverage to dependents that have lost other health insurance.  Retirees must already be enrolled in the DoD HBP (post-retirement medical coverage) in order to initiate or change dependent coverage. 4.6.1.1.  SAD Plan.  Enrolled employees may add new dependents to the plan within 31 days after a life-changing event.  Eligible employees who waived or canceled coverage,   18  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 or who did not enroll new dependents when first eligible, must wait until the next Open Enrollment Period to join. 4.6.1.2.  The  effective  date  of  coverage  depends  on  the  circumstance  under  which  the employee  is  newly  electing  coverage,  or  the  employee/retiree  is  increasing  existing coverage.  To determine the effective date, refer to the SPD. 4.6.1.3.  Employees  Affected  by  a  Reduction in  Hours  Resulting  from  Troop Deployment.    When  troop  deployment  results  in  a  personnel  action  that  reduces  an employee’s employment category to flexible consequently the employee drops DoD HBP enrollment, the employee is permitted to re-enroll outside of an Open Enrollment Period if the following conditions are met: 4.6.1.3.1.  The employee meets all normal eligibility requirements. 4.6.1.3.2.  NAF-HR  Section  processes  an  AF  Form  2545  change  of  employment category to regular status.  (T-2) 4.6.1.3.3.  The employee re-enrolls in the DoD HBP within 31 days from the effective date of the personnel action increasing the employee’s hours; otherwise, the employee must wait until the next Open Enrollment Period.  If the employee enrolls within the 31-day period as explained above, coverage is effective on the date of application, but not earlier than the date of change of employment category back to regular status. AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   19  Chapter 5 PROGRAM ADVERTISING 5.1.  The  Carrier:  Updates  the  group  insurance  SPDs  and  prepares  and  distributes  Open Enrollment Period materials. 5.2.  NAF-HR  :  Are  responsible  for  distributing  and  explaining  the  SPD  contents  and  benefit materials to employees. (T-0) 5.3.  AFSVA/SVXHI:  Fulfills these responsibilities for retirees.   20  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 Chapter 6 PREMIUMS 6.1.  There  are  two  enrollment  classes,  single  and  family.  Employee  and  retiree  claims  are pooled  together  within  these  classes  to  develop  premiums.    Premiums  cover  the  cost  of  claims and Carrier administrative fees.  The DoD HBP is contributory, meaning employees and retirees both pay a portion of the total premium cost. 6.2.  Employer  and  Employee  Premium  Sharing  Arrangements  for  PPO  Network, Traditional-Indemnity,  and  DoD  HBP  Dental  Plans.  The  employer’s  share  of  the  PPO Network, Traditional-Indemnity, and DoD HBP Dental premiums is 70 percent. Employees and retirees pay 30 percent. 6.3.  SAD Plan.  Employees pay 100 percent of the premium.  There is no employer contribution to this plan.  Retirees are not eligible for the SAD Plan. AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   21  Chapter 7 LEAVE WITHOUT PAY (LWOP) COVERAGE 7.1.  During  approved  LWOP:  An  employee  may  elect  to  continue  coverage  under  the  DoD HBP,  provided  he  or  she  continues  to  pay  the  required  employee  share  of  the  premium.  Consequently,  the  employer  will  continue  to  pay  the  employer’s  share.  (EXCEPTION:  The SAD Plan is 100 percent employee-paid with no employer contribution.)  This LWOP provision for  insurance  continuation  also  applies  to  employees  placed  on  Workers’  Compensation  for  a work-related accident or injury. 7.1.1.  The coverage cannot be continued beyond 12 months from the date the LWOP began, except  in  the  case  of  authorized  LWOP  for  military  service  or  in  other  circumstances considered  appropriate  by  AFSVA/SVXHI.    The  NAF-HR  Section  should  counsel  the supervisor and employee prior to the LWOP period about continuing participation in the plan and  the  termination  of  coverage  due  to  non-  payment  of  contributions,  as  well  as reinstatement of coverage opportunities. 7.1.2.  When  an  employee  in  LWOP  status  fails  to  pay  required  contributions,  coverage  is canceled  effective  on  the  first  day  of  the  pay  period  following  the  pay  period  in  which  the employee failed to make a contribution. 7.1.2.1.  The  NAF-HR  Section  cancels  the  employee’s  coverage  using  the  change  form and sends it to the Carrier Eligibility Unit.  The NAF-HR Section also notifies the SSC of the coverage cancellation using AF Form 2545. 7.1.2.2.  File copies of the change form and personnel action in the employee’s OPF. 7.1.3.  Losing  Coverage.    Any  employee  losing  group  coverage  due  to  the  non-payment  of contributions  is  not  eligible for  continuing  coverage and may not  re-enroll in  the plan until the next Open Enrollment Period or a Special Enrollment Period, if applicable. 7.1.4.  Disability  Clause.    Under  the  DoD  HBP,  the  Program  does  not  have  a  disability clause, which would allow employees to receive payments while out on disability.  In other words, the Program does not offer an income replacement provision for disability.  Instead, in  place  of  short  or  long-term  disability  insurance,  employees  may  use  their  annual  or  sick leave  to  be  paid  during  the  period  of  their  disability;  or  if  applicable,  they  may  request approval through their supervisors and NAF-HR Section to be placed on leave-without-pay.  Employees  may  also  solicit  request  leave  donations  from  eligible  NAF  employees  via  the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program to offset time away from duty. 7.2.  LWOP:  Due to  Transfer with  Head of  Household.   Regular employees on  LWOP  due to transfer with head of household are entitled to remain in the DoD HBP, including SAD, for up to 150 days to avoid a break in service.  The NAF-HR Section should counsel employees prior to departure  about  continuing  participation  in  the  plan  while  on  LWOP,  continuing  coverage programs  upon  expiration  of  the  LWOP,  termination  of  coverage  due  to  nonpayment  of contributions, as well as reinstatement of coverage opportunities. (T-0) 7.2.1.  If  the  employee  does  not  elect  to  continue  participation  in  the  plan,  the  NAF-HR Section cancels coverage using the change form and sends it to the Carrier Eligibility Unit.    22  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 The NAF-HR Section also notifies the SSC of the cancellation of coverage using AF Form 2545. (T-0) 7.2.1.1.  The  effective  date  of  cancellation  is  the  date  the  employee  signs  the  change form. 7.2.1.2.  File copies of the change form and personnel action in the employee’s OPF. 7.2.2.  If the employee elects to continue participation in the plan, the NAF-HR Section will suspense a copy of the change form for 150 days. (T-0) 7.2.2.1.  The NAF-HR Section cancels coverage and notifies the SSC and the Carrier to cancel coverage when the employee reaches the end of the 150-day LWOP period; unless a gaining installation contacts the losing installation to request the employee’s OPF and change form for purposes of continuing his/her coverage without a break.  (T-0)  Contact the AFSVA/SVXHI  for  special  guidance for continuing the  employee’s coverage at the gaining  installation  without  interruption.    Otherwise,  if  canceling  the  employee’s coverage  because  the  150-day  LWOP  period  has  expired,  the  effective  date  of cancellation is the date the employee lost LWOP eligibility. 7.2.2.2.  If  the  employee  fails  to  pay  required  contributions  during  the  150-day  LWOP period, the NAF-HR Section cancels coverage effective on the first day of the pay period after  the  pay  period  that  he  or  she  failed  to  make  a  payment.    Follow  the  normal instructions  for  notifying  the  SSC  and  the  Carrier  of  the  employee’s  cancellation  of coverage. 7.3.  Rehiring  and  LWOP  Employee.  If  an  employee  is  rehired  in  an  eligible  employment category before the expiration of the  LWOP,  the gaining NAF-HR Section will verify with  the losing  NAF-HR  Section  that  the  employee  made  all  required  contribution  payments  and  that coverage was not terminated. (T-0) 7.3.1.  If  the  employee’s  account  is  current,  the  gaining  NAF-HR  Section  requests  the employee’s  change  form  from  the  losing  NAF-HR  Section.    The  gaining  NAF-HR  Section updates the change form with the gaining installation’s control-suffix-account number (group policy number), the effective date of the transaction, and the employee’s new home address, and  DoD  HBP/SAD  plan  number;  and  sends  a  copy  to  the  Carrier  Eligibility  Unit.    The gaining NAF-HR Section notifies the SSC of the employee’s continued enrollment using AF Form 2545 to start deductions. (T-0) 7.3.2.  If the employee’s account is not current and coverage has not yet been terminated, and if the employee is still eligible to remain in the plan, the employee must first make required  retroactive  contributions  to  the  losing  installation.    The  gaining  NAF-HR Section verifies with the losing NAF-HR Section that the employee made all the required payments  and follows the processing instructions in  this AFI  for notifying the SSC and the Carrier of the employee’s continued enrollment at the gaining installation.  (T-0) 7.4.  Coverage  During  Military  Service.  The  Uniformed  Services  Employment  and Reemployment Rights  Act  of 1994 (USERRA) covers NAF  employees who leave their jobs  to perform  duty  with  the  Uniformed  Services.    Employees  who  are  on  LWOP  while  performing military  duty  may  continue  participation  in  the  DoD  HBP  medical/dental  plans  for  up  to  24 months by paying the employee share of the applicable DoD HBP premium.  In accordance with AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   23  USERRA, employees who elect not to continue DoD HBP coverage while on military duty are entitled  to  immediate  reinstatement  in  the  same  DoD  HBP  coverage  when  they  return  to  NAF employment without waiting for an Open Enrollment Period (in this case, coverage is reinstated effective on the date the employee returns to NAF duty). 7.4.1.  Should  an  employee  placed  on  military  furlough  be  required  to  pay  for  coverage continuation,  the  NAF-HR  Section  will  monitor  the  contributions  for  the  duration  of  the military  furlough period, and coordinate with  the SSC, as necessary, to  report any payment default or cancellation of coverage. 7.4.2.  If the employee qualifies for the employer-paid premium benefit under the DoD HBP, the NAF-HR Section will notify the SSC using pre-established AFSVA procedures.  At the minimum,  the  SSC  should  receive  supporting  documentation  from  the  NAF-HR  Section  to start/stop the employer-paid premium benefit.  Contact AFSVA/SVXHI for special guidance if the employee’s military furlough period extends beyond 24 months.  (T-2) 7.4.3.  For reservists called to active duty on or after 14 September 2001 in support of a Contingency Operation, as defined in Section 101 (a)(13) of title 10, USC, the following special rules apply: 7.4.3.1.  Military  Reservists  Serving  in  Contingency  Operations.    NAF  employers  shall pay the employee’s share in addition to the employer’s share of the DoD HBP premium for  up  to  24  months  for  enrolled  employees  called  to  active  duty  (voluntarily  or involuntarily) in support of a Contingency Operation.  To be eligible for this employer-pay-all premium provision, reservists must be placed on LWOP or separated from NAF employment to perform active duty for a period of more than 30 consecutive days.  These provisions  apply  to  employees  enrolled  in  the  DoD  HBP  who  elect  to  continue  the enrollment, and who are called to active duty on or after 14 September 2001. 7.4.3.2.  Refer to the AFSVA pre-established instructions for application and processing procedures  related  to  the  employer-pay-all  premium  provision  for  military  reservists serving in contingency operations.  Go to the AFSVA website or contact AFSVA/SVXHI for an information copy.   24  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 Chapter 8 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE 8.1.  NAF employees:  Are covered by Public Law No. 1033, Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993  (FMLA).    Under  FMLA,  eligible  employees  are  entitled  to  a  total  of  12  administrative workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for specified family and medical needs. Refer  to  the  AFSVA  pre-established  instructions  for  application  and  processing  procedures related to the employer-pay-all premium provision for military reservists serving in contingency operations.  Go to the AFSVA website or contact AFSVA/SVXHI for an information copy.  (For military-related situations, eligible employees are entitled up to 26 administrative workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for specified family and medical needs.) 8.2.  During  approved  periods  of  FMLA  leave:  Employees  enrolled  in  the  DoD  HBP  or  the SAD Plan may continue their health and dental coverage. 8.2.1.  Employee and employer contributions  are  shared  according to  guidelines established in this instruction. 8.2.2.  Employees  not  continuing  DoD  HBP  or  SAD  coverage  while  on  FMLA  leave  are entitled  to  reinstatement  as  though  they  had  continued  in  active  employment  rather  than going  on  FMLA,  provided  they  request  such  coverage  within  31  days  of  the  date  FMLA terminates.  If they miss the 31-day deadline to reenroll, they must wait until the next Open Enrollment Period. AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   25  Chapter 9 PORTABILITY MOVE FROM NAF TO APF. 9.1.  An enrolled NAF employee who moves to an APF position without a break in service of  more  than  3  days:  Shall  continue  existing  health  and  dental  coverage  in  the  DoD  HBP without  charge  to  the  employee  for  31  days,  or  until  the  employee  becomes  covered  under  the FEHB Program; whichever comes first. 9.2.  This  provision  does  not  apply  to  the  SAD  Plan.  SAD  coverage  ends  on  the  day  the employee loses group eligibility or terminates NAF employment.   26  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 Chapter 10 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS FOR DOD HBP. 10.1.  Benefits  payable  under  the  DoD  HBP  take  into  account  any  coverage  an  employee, retiree, or dependent has under any other group plan.  The SPDs provide an explanation of how benefits are coordinated. 10.2.  Active  Employees.  Benefits  will  be  coordinated  to  ensure  reimbursement  to  active employees under the DoD HBP take into account payments made by other group plans.  Under this approach, active employees will not receive a total benefit greater than that provided under the DoD HBP plan. 10.3.  Retirees.  When retirees or their covered dependents are eligible for Medicare (whether or not enrolled in Medicare), DoD HBP benefits are secondary to Medicare. When retirees and their dependents become eligible for Medicare (whether or not enrolled in Medicare), health benefits from  the  DoD  HBP  will  be  offset  by  Medicare  payments  through  the  Government  Exclusion approach  to  Coordination  of  Benefits,  as  explained  in  the  SPDs.        Medicare  does  not  apply overseas; therefore, the Traditional-Indemnity Plan will be the primary payer of benefits. AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   27  Chapter 11 COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE ACTIVE EMPLOYEES AGE 65 AND OLDER 11.1.  At  least  31  days  before  an  enrolled  employee  in  the  DoD  HBP  reaches  age 65:  DCPDS will generate a notice to the NAF-HR Section.  The NAF-HR Section will contact the affected employee who must elect to either continue or cancel coverage under the DoD HBP.  The NAF-HR Section will  (T-0): 11.1.1.  Instruct the employee to make the election, in writing, on the appropriate personnel form. 11.1.2.  Advise  the  employee  to  promptly  contact  the  Social  Security  Administration concerning  eligibility  and    enrollment  rules  for  Medicare,  regardless  of  the  employee’s election to continue or discontinue enrollment in the  DoD HBP. 11.2.  If the employee elects to continue participation in the DoD HBP:  The DoD HBP will be  the  primary  payer  of  all  claims,  and  Medicare  will  be  the  secondary  payer  as  required  by Federal law.  The SPDs have more details and an explanation of any exceptions to this rule. 11.3.  If the employee elects to cancel coverage under the DoD HBP:  The employee’s health coverage  is  limited  to  Medicare  only.    Inform  the  employee  that  his  or  her  election  to  cancel coverage  also  cancels  coverage  at  the  same  time  for  any  dependents  under  the  DoD  HBP.  Follow  the  instructions  in  this  AFI  for  notifying  the  SSC  and  Carrier  about  the  employee’s cancellation of coverage under the DoD HBP.   28  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 Chapter 12 CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE FOR SURVIVING DEPENDENTS 12.1.  Eligible surviving dependents:  May continue DoD HBP coverage at a cost and length of time commensurate with  the sponsoring employee’s or retiree’s PRM eligibility status  or  years of  DoD  HBP  participation.    AFSVA/SVXHI  is  office  responsible  for  managing  coverage  for surviving  dependents  with  regard  to  continuing  DoD  HBP  benefits.    NAF-HR  Sections  should immediately contact AFSVA/SVXHI for assistance when a surviving-dependent case arises. (T-2) 12.2.  Eligibility  requirements  for  continuation  of  coverage  for  surviving  dependents:  Are as follows: 12.2.1.  Dependents.    For  the  purpose  of  continuation  of  coverage  for  survivors,  eligible dependents  include  children  conceived  before,  and  born  after,  the  death  of  an  employee  or retiree.    If  the  surviving  spouse  remarries,  neither  the  new  spouse  nor  any  dependents acquired upon remarriage are eligible for the DoD HBP. 12.2.2.  Dependent  Participation  Requirement.    Surviving  dependents  must  have  been enrolled in  the DoD  HBP health and dental plans on the day of the employee’s or retiree’s death. 12.2.3.  Employee Participation  Requirement.   The employee must have  had a minimum  of 90  days  of  participation  in  the  DoD  HBP.    Enrollment  in  a  NAF  employer  health  plan existing before 1 January 2000 counts towards the participation requirement.  Enrollment in the FEHB Program also counts toward the participation requirement if the employee moved from an APF position to a NAF position, after 1 January 1987, without a break in service of more than three days. 12.3.  Cost and Length of Coverage. 12.3.1.  The  NAF  employer  will  pay  100  percent  of  the  health  and  dental  premium  for eligible survivors for the first four months of coverage following the employee’s or retiree’s death.    Following  the  four  months  of  employer-paid  coverage,  survivors  are  eligible  to continue coverage as outlined in Table 12.1. 12.3.2.  Coverage  for  a  surviving  spouse  continues  regardless  of  remarriage.    Coverage  for dependent children continues for the length of time (duration) provided in the Table 12.1., or until the child no longer meets the plan eligibility criteria; whichever comes first. AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   29   Table 12.1.  Surviving Dependent Coverage     Surviving Dependent of: 1.  An employee who: a.  Had less than 15 years of cumulative participation in the DoD HBP health plan or b. Was not participating in the applicable defined benefit retirement plan at time of death. Type and Length of Coverage:  Cost to Survivor: 36-months  total  duration of  coverage  =  medical only benefits.  No dental. No cost for first 4 months after the employee’s death; then Survivor pays the applicable TCC premium rate of 102 percent (employee/employer shares plus an administrative fee of 2 percent). 2.  An employee who did not meet the PRM eligibility but: Same  health  coverage  as the employee. No cost for first 4 months after the employee's death;  Same  dental  coverage,  if the  employee  also  had  15 or  more  years  cumulative participation in  a  DoD HBP dental plan. then Survivor pays the same premium rate as an active employee (30 percent). Same  health  and  dental coverage  applicable  to  the retiree or employee. No cost for first 4 months after the retiree's or employee's death; then Survivor pays the applicable PRM premium rate (30 percent). a.  Had 15 or more years of cumulative  participation  in the DoD HBP health plan and b. Was participating in the applicable defined benefit retirement plan at time of death. 3.  A retiree receiving PRM, or an employee who met the PRM annuity/participation eligibility. Note:  A survivor retirement annuity is NOT required in order for the surviving dependent to continue DoD HBP health plan coverage.   30  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 Chapter 13 TEMPORARY CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE (TCC) 13.1.  Plan  participants  who  become  ineligible  to  participate  in  the  DoD  HBP  for  any reason (other than termination for gross misconduct or cause):  May be eligible to continue coverage  in  the  TCC  Program  of  the  DoD  HBP.    Special  continuation  of  coverage  provisions apply to surviving dependents of former employees/retirees enrolled in the DoD HBP.  Refer to the DoD HBP Policy and the medical SPD for more details. 13.2.  DoD HBP Health Plans.  The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA)  requiring  employers  to  provide  temporary  continuation  of  health  benefits  does  not apply to the PPO Network and Traditional-Indemnity Plans. 13.2.1.  Plan participants who become ineligible to participate in these plans are eligible for “COBRA-  like”  TCC  as  stated  below.    Plan  participants  cannot  continue  dental  coverage under the TCC Program.  Go to the AFSVA website or contact the AFSVA/SVXHI for the TCC application form  and current  rates,  as well as basic instructions for processing a TCC request under the DoD HBP. 13.2.2.  TCC does not apply to the SAD Plan. 13.2.3.  Basic TCC Eligibility Requirements.  Refer to the medical SPD for more information about the eligibility requirements, definitions, and TCC application timelines.  The following participants are eligible for TCC: 13.2.3.1.  Retirees.  Employees who retire without obtaining eligibility for PRM Benefits. 13.2.3.2.  Dependents.  Dependents who lose DoD HBP coverage because the sponsoring employee or retiree lost coverage or who otherwise become ineligible to participate. 13.3.  TCC  Length  and  Cost  for  DoD  HBP  Plan  Participants.  Refer  to  Table  13.1  for descriptions of length and cost of TCC for different circumstances. 13.3.1.  Disabled Employees.  Totally disabled employees receive up to 36 months of single or  family  TCC,  as  applicable.    TCC  ends  before  36  months  if  the  participant  ceases  to  be totally  disabled  or  becomes  eligible  for  Medicare  or  other  health  coverage.    Disabled employees with 5 or more years of cumulative DoD HBP participation will receive up to 12 months of continuing coverage at no charge if they meet the criteria.  Participation includes enrollment in the DoD HBP, in a NAF Component health plan, and enrollment in the FEHB Program  if  the  employee  moved  from  an  APF  position  to  a  NAF  position,  after  1  January 1987,  without  a  break  in  service  of  more  than  3  days.    Refer  to  the  medical  SPD  for definitions of total disability and procedures for providing proof of disability.  The NAF-HR Section  coordinates  with  AFSVA/SVXHI including dependents, in TCC disability coverage under the DoD HBP. (T-0) to  enroll  qualified  employees, 13.3.2.  Disabled  Retirees  Eligible  for  PRM.    If  a  disabled  retiree  qualifies  for  continuing health  benefits  under  PRM  coverage,  the  individual  will  not  be  enrolled  in  disability  TCC due  to  the  limited  duration  of  coverage  under  the  TCC  Program.    Instead,  disabled  retirees eligible  for  PRM  will  receive  continuing  health  benefits  under  the  same  conditions  and  for the  same  duration  as  non-disabled  retirees.    In  certain  cases  where  unusual  circumstances AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   31  exist, totally disabled employees who retire with PRM coverage may receive up to 12 months free coverage, as determined by the NAF employer. 13.3.3.  TCC Termination.  Generally, TCC for DoD HBP participants  may continue for up to 18 months from the date group eligibility ends.  The TCC participant pays the full cost of the  health  premium,  plus  a  two  percent  administrative  fee.    TCC  benefits  will  terminate earlier than described in Table 13.1 if the participant becomes eligible for Medicare or other health  coverage,  fails  to  pay  required  premiums  by  the  due  date,  or  voluntarily  chooses  to cancel coverage prior to the TCC expiration period. Table 13.1.   TCC Health Plan   Eligible Individual: 1.Employee, retiree, or dependent meeting TCC criteria. 2.  Totally disabled employee with less than 5 years of cumulative participation in the DoD HBP health plan. 3.  Totally disabled employee with 5 or more years of cumulative participation in the DoD HBP health plan. Note: TCC does NOT apply to disabled employees who are eligible to retire with PRM coverage. Length of Health Plan Coverage:  Cost to Individual: Up to 18 months from the date group coverage ends. Up  to  36  months  from  the date group coverage ends. Up  to  36  months  from  the date group coverage ends. 102 percent of the total premium cost (employee and employer shares, plus an administrative fee of 2 percent). 102 percent of the total premium cost (employee and employer shares, plus an administrative fee of 2 percent). No cost for first 12 months. NAF employer pays 102 percent of the total premium cost (employee and employer shares, plus an administrative fee of 2 percent); then TCC participant pays 102 percent of the total premium cost (employee and employer shares, plus an administrative fee of 2 percent) for up to 24 additional months. 13.3.4.  Survivors  of  TCC  Participants.    Should  a  TCC  participant  (sponsor)  with  family coverage  pass  away,  the  surviving  dependents  are  ineligible  for  continuation  beyond  the maximum length of coverage indicated in Table 13.1.  In this case, under the TCC Program,   32  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 the TCC participant’s death does not trigger an additional period of coverage under the TCC Program. 13.3.5.  Special  Considerations  for  Base  Realignment  and  Closure  (BRAC)  and  Workforce Reduction.  In situations where an employee is separated from NAF employment because of BRAC or workforce reduction, the employer may pay the employer’s share of the DoD HBP health premium and any applicable administrative fees for the employee for up to 18 months or  the  NAF  Component  may  require  the  employee  to  pay  the  full  cost  of  the  coverage, including  any  applicable  administrative  fees.    However,  the  employer  may  not  pay  any portion  of  the  employee’s  share.    Where  the  employee’s  separation  is  a  direct  result  of  an approved BRAC action, the employer may use APF BRAC accounts or NAF funds to pay the employer’s  share  of  the  DoD  HBP  health  premium  and  administrative  fee.    To  be  eligible, the employee affected by BRAC or workforce reduction must meet the following conditions: 13.3.5.1.  Must have been separated by BBA or resign or retire (if not eligible for PRM) after receiving a BBA separation notice.. 13.3.5.2.  Must been enrolled in the DoD NAF HBP for at least 6 months and be enrolled at the time of separation by BBA. AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   33  Chapter 14 PERSONNEL ACTIONS 14.1.  Processing  Personnel  Actions  within  Payroll  System.  The  SSC  processes  transactions from  DCPDS  that  begin,  cancel,  or  change  the  employee  and  employer  payroll  deductions  for group  health  and  dental  coverage.    The  SSC  also  processes  any  other  health/dental  insurance-related  actions  based  upon  information  received  from  DCPDS.    The  effective  date  of  the personnel form determines when deductions for coverage starts, stops, or changes. 14.1.1.  For enrollments, payroll deductions start in the same pay period that an employee’s coverage is effective. 14.1.2.  For  cancellations  and  terminations,  including  discontinuance  of  coverage  at  an employee’s  request,  employee  and  employer  contribution  deductions  are  not  taken  for  the last pay period that the insurance was in effect. 14.1.3.  For a change that increases coverage from single to family coverage, or from health- only to health and dental coverage, payroll deductions for the increased coverage begin with the  pay  period  during  which  the  change  becomes  effective.    The  effective  date  of  the insurance  change  depends  on  the  event  which  prompted  the  employee’s  opportunity  to increase  coverage,  such  as  a  newly  eligible  dependent,  an  Open  Enrollment  Period,  or  a Special Enrollment Period due to a life-qualifying event. 14.1.4.  For a change that decreases coverage from family to single coverage, or from health and  dental  to  health-only  coverage,  employee  and  employer  contributions  are  not  taken  for the last pay period such coverage was in effect.  The effective date of the  insurance change depends on the event that prompted the employee’s opportunity to decrease coverage such as an ineligible dependent, death, divorce, an Open Enrollment Period, or upon the employee’s request. 14.2.  Performing Routine Insurance Audits/Reconciling Reports.  The NAF-HR Section will reconcile the biweekly group insurance enrollment/deduction report generated by the SSC with health/dental insurance-related actions submitted on AF Forms 2545, and take corrective action in DCPDS or through the SSC or the Carrier, as required.  (T-2) 14.2.1.  If  an  insurance  correction  for  a  refund  or  deduction  applies  to  two  pay  periods  or less,  errors  are  corrected  through  the  payroll  system  using  current  AFSFMS  payroll procedures. 14.2.2.  If an insurance correction is for more than two pay periods, the SSC in coordination with  the  NAF-HR  Section,  will  provide  the  following  information  to  AFSVA/SVXHI  for review and corrective action.  (T-2) 14.2.2.1.  Explanation  of  the  problem  and  include  the  NAFI  Cash  Management Investment Program (CMIP) number and the pay periods involved. 14.2.2.2.  Copies  of  the  previous  AF  Form  2545  reflecting  the  effective  date  of  the “incorrect” erroneous information (group insurance plan code or effective date, etc.) and the  new  AF  Form  2545  reflecting  the  correct  effective  date  of  the  “correction.”    Also   34  AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015 include  copies  of  supporting  documents  reflecting  the  employee’s  enrollment,  change, cancellation, or waiver of insurance, as applicable. 14.2.2.3.  Worksheets  by  pay  period  indicating,    the  amounts  actually  paid  by  the employee  and  employer,  along  with  the  amounts  that  should  have  been  paid  by  both parties. (Take into account any rate changes that may have occurred under the DoD HBP or SAD Plan.) 14.2.2.4.  Name, social security number, and home address of the employee involved. 14.2.2.5.  The  NAF-HR  Section  will  notify  the  employee  of  the  corrective  action, including the related refund or retroactive amount due, and the procedures for requesting a waiver of indebtedness for retroactive contribution  cases in  accordance  with  AFMAN 34-212, Control Procedures for Protecting NAF Assets.  (T-2) 14.3.  Contribution Shortages.  The NAF-HR Section will coordinate with the SSC, and review any available arrearage/shortage reports generated by the SSC  and also initiate some method of contact  or  notice  when  an  employee’s  pay  is  insufficient  to  cover  his/her  share  of  the  group health/dental  premium.    This  is  especially  important  as  most  premium  arrearages/shortages typically  occur  when  an  employee  goes  on  LWOP  (including  LWOP  related  to  workers’ compensation) or furlough.  (T-2) 14.3.1.  If the employee pays the shortage no later than the pay period following the one in which  the  shortage  occurred,  the  SSC  processes  the  collection  for  the  next  pay  period.  Coverage continues without interruption. 14.3.2.  If  the  employee  fails  to  pay  the  shortage  by  the  pay  period  following  the  one  in which  the  shortage  occurred,  the  NAF-HR  Section  contacts  the  employee  to  determine payment status.  If no resolution occurs, the NAF-HR Section immediately cancels coverage due  to  nonpayment.    The  effective  date  of  cancellation  is  the  first  day  of  the  pay  period immediately following the default pay period.  (T-2) 14.3.2.1.  The NAF-HR Section completes the coverage cancellation form (change form) and forwards it to the Carrier Eligibility Unit.  (T-0) 14.3.2.2.  The  NAF-HR  Section  processes  an  AF  Form  2545  to  notify  the  SSC  of  the employee’s cancellation of group health/dental coverage and files copies of both forms in the employee’s OPF.  (T-0) 14.4.  Reviewing Eligibility During Leave-Without-Pay (LWOP). 14.4.1.  Employees  may  continue  coverage  in  the  DoD  HBP  during  a  period  of  approved LWOP,  provided  they  continue  to  pay  their  share  of  the  employee  contribution; consequently,  the  employer  (NAFI)  continues  to  pay  the  employer’s  share.    Coverage remains in effect as long as the respective shares are paid.  EXCEPTION:  The SAD Plan is 100 percent employee-paid with no employer contribution. 14.4.2.  The  NAF-HR  Section  will  coordinate  with  the  SSC  when  an  employee  on  LWOP fails  to  pay  the  required  contributions  or  reaches  the  maximum  period  for  participation  as defined below: (T-2) 14.4.2.1.  An employee on LWOP (for reasons other than illness or injury) is entitled to remain in the DoD HBP for 12 months unless AFSVA/SVXHI grants an extension. AFI34-305  29 APRIL 2015   35  14.4.2.2.  An  employee  on  LWOP  due  to  transfer  with  head  of  household  is  entitled  to remain in the DoD HBP for a maximum of 150 calendar days. 14.4.2.3.  An  employee  on  LWOP  due  to  military  furlough  is  entitled  to  remain  in  the DoD HBP for a maximum of 24 months.  The NAF-HR Section follows the instructions in paragraphs 7.4 thru 7.4.3.2. 14.4.2.3.1.    Should  an  employee  placed  on  military  furlough  be  required  to  pay  for coverage  continuation,  the  NAF-HR  Section  will  monitor  the  contributions  for  the duration  of  the  military  furlough  period,  and  coordinate  with  the  AFSVA  SSC,  as necessary,  to  report  any  payment  default  or  cancellation  of  coverage.    Otherwise,  if  the employee  qualifies  for  the  employer-paid  premium  benefit  under  the  DoD  HBP,  the NAF-HR Section will notify the AFSVA SSC.
