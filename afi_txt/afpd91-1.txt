RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.  OPR:  AFSEC/SEW  Supersedes:  AFPD, 13 December 2010  Certified by: AF/SE  (Maj Gen Andrew M. Mueller) Pages: 4 This  Directive  implements  Department  of  Defense  Directive  (DoDD)  3150.02,  Department  of Defense  Nuclear  Weapons  Surety  Program.    It  also  establishes  the  Air  Force  Nuclear  Surety Program. The potential destructive power of nuclear weapons is well known, and all radioactive materials pose hazards if not properly controlled. Nuclear systems require special handling and other  protective  measures  to  prevent  accidents,  unauthorized  use,  or  dangerous  exposure.  This Directive  provides  policies  for  managing  nuclear  weapons  and  weapon  systems,  and  for protecting  personnel,  property,  and  the  environment  from  hazardous  exposure  to  radioactive materials.  These policies apply to all Air Force personnel, including the Air National Guard of the United States (i.e., the Air National Guard in Title 10 status), the Air Force Reserve, nuclear certified  equipment,  and  facilities  involved  with  nuclear  weapons,  nuclear  weapon  systems, radioactive  materials-related  programs,  and  nuclear  systems  certified  software.  Personnel involved  with  nuclear  weapons,  nuclear  weapon  systems,  and  radioactive  materials  are responsible  for  compliance.  This  publication  may  not  be  supplemented.    Refer  recommended changes and questions about this policy directive to the Office of Primary Responsibility using the AF  Form 847,  Recommendation for  Change of  Publication. Ensure  all records created  as a result  of  processes  prescribed  in  this  publication  are  maintained  in  accordance  with  Air  Force Manual  (AFMAN)  33-363,  Management  of  Records,  and  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  Air Force  Records  Information  Management  System  (AFRIMS)  Records  Disposition  Schedule (RDS). 2 AFPD91-1  30 NOVEMBER 2016 SUMMARY OF CHANGES Added  AF/A10  coordination  role  with  AF/SE.    Added  roles  and  responsibilities  for  AF/SG, SAF/AA, and SAF/AQ.  Clarified the AF/SE’s nuclear surety oversight role of nuclear weapons and  weapon  systems  is  throughout  the  Stockpile-To-Target  Sequence.    Also  renumbered document to comply with AFI 33-360 formatting requirements. 1.  Policy. 1.1.  Nuclear Surety as defined in DoDD 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapons Surety Program, is the  centerpiece  of  the  Air  Force  Nuclear  Enterprise.  Air  Force  leaders  at  all  levels  will provide  emphasis  to  ensure  focus  remains  on  nuclear  surety.  Priority  will  be  to  strengthen nuclear surety compliance in accordance with  guidance contained in Air Force publications and technical orders. 1.2.  The  Air  Force  will  ensure  nuclear  weapons  and  weapon  systems  receive  special attention  and  consideration  because  of  their  political  and  military  importance,  their destructive power, and the potential consequences of an accident, unauthorized act, or public perception of such. 1.3.  The  Air  Force  will  ensure  that  personnel,  the  environment,  and  property  are  protected from  undue  risk  of  damage  or  harm  by  maintaining  risks  as  low  as  reasonably  possible consistent  with  mission  requirements.  This  policy  applies  to  nuclear  weapons,  nuclear weapon  systems,  nuclear  energy  power  and  propulsion  systems,  and  the  life  cycle  of  all terrestrial reactors. Also included are radioactive sources intended for missile or space use. 1.4.  The Air Force will keep personnel exposures to intrinsic ionizing radiation from nuclear weapons as low as reasonably achievable (also  known as ALARA) consistent with  mission requirements. 1.5.  The  Air  Force  will  establish  and  conduct  programs  to  maintain  surety  of  nuclear weapons and weapon systems in Air Force custody through the complete Stockpile-to-Target Sequence (STS). Additionally, the Air Force will ensure the safety and security of terrestrial reactors  the  Air  Force  owns  or  operates;  all  nuclear  energy  power  and  propulsion  systems, and radioactive sources intended for missile or space use. 2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 2.1.  The  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  Installations,  Environment  and  Energy (SAF/IE)  will,  in  accordance  with  the  HAF  Mission  Directive  (HAFMD)  1-18,  provide guidance,  direction,  and  oversight  of  all  matters  pertaining  to  the  formulation,  review,  and execution  of  policies,  plans,  programs,  and  budgets  relative  to  environment,  safety, occupational health, radiation safety, and radioactive materials management matters. SAF/IE coordination is required before this document is changed, reissued, or rescinded. 2.2.  The  Chief  of  Safety  (AF/SE)  will  provide  guidance,  direction,  and  oversight  of  all matters pertaining to nuclear surety of all nuclear weapons and weapon systems in Air Force custody  throughout  the  STS.    AF/SE  will,  in  accordance  with  Air  Force  Policy  Directive (AFPD)  13-5,  Air  Force  Nuclear  Enterprise,  coordinate  with  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for Strategic  Deterrence  and  Nuclear  Integration  (AF/A10)  to  develop  and  establish  Air  Force Nuclear  Surety  standards,  guidance,  training,  planning,  programs,  and  safety  design certification of nuclear weapon systems and components. AFPD91-1  30 NOVEMBER 2016 3 2.3.  The  Surgeon  General  (AF/SG)  and  AF/SE  will  issue  coordinated  guidance  on radiological health matters. 2.4.  The  Administrative  Assistant  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SAF/AA)  is  the Restricted  Data/Formerly  Restricted  Data  Management  Official  and  provides  oversight  for accountability,  training,  and  provision  of  accurate  guidance  for  handling,  safeguarding, protecting, or releasing  nuclear-related information  pursuant  to  Title 42 United States Code Section 2011 et.seq. Atomic Energy Act of 1954; 10 CFR Part 1045, Nuclear Classification and Declassification; and Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5210.02, Access to and Dissemination of Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data. 2.5.
