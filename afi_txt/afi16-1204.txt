General. The following guidance is established to ensure the proper safeguards, accounting, andcontrol measures of all medications maintained by the squadrons. In-depth guidance may be found in AFI41-209, Medical Logistics Support. 2.2.  Categories of Control. Drugs are designated as controlled by the Attorney General because of dem-onstrated or potential abuse. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Department of Justice, designatesdrugs as controlled substances, under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse, Prevention, and Control Act of1970 and assigns them to one of five schedules. The term "controlled medical items" includes the follow-ing type items: 2.2.1.  Code R applies to precious metals, drugs or other substances designated by the DEA as Sched-ule II controlled substances. The category includes stock listed items identified by an R in the Notescolumn of federal supply catalogs and similar non-stock listed items. 2.2.1.1.  Code Q applies to drugs or other substances designated by the DEA as Schedule III, IV,or V controlled substances. The category includes stock listed items with a Q in the Notes columnof federal supply catalogs and similar non-stock listed items. The Medical Logistics Flight Chiefmay designate additional items to be accounted for and stored as prescribed for code Q items.NOTE: Code “Q” items fall under the same guidelines as code “R” items. 2.2.1.2.  Controlled items will be procured, stored, shipped and disposed of accordingly. 2.2.1.3.  Reporting Loss or Theft of Controlled Substances to DEA. When a loss or theft of con-trolled substances is determined, the Medical Logistics NCOIC will immediately prepare DEAForm 106, Report of Loss or Theft of Controlled Drugs, and submit it to the nearest DEAregional office. DEA Form 106 is available from DEA regional offices. NOTE: All loss or theft of controlled substances needs to be reported back to the applicable MTFthrough the Medical Logistics Flight CC who holds the DEA certificate. In some situations, the pharma-cist may hold the DEA certificate. 2.3.  Command Surgeons or designated representatives:2.3.1.  Determine the type and quantities of all medications stocked, maintained and administered rel-evant to providing emergency medical care IAW individual qualifications and levels of certification.Ensure applicable coordination is accomplished with HQ USAF/SG and AFMLO and that itemsmaintained are IAW applicable allowance standards (AS). 2.3.2.  Revise and update required medications keeping with current concepts of emergency medicineand standards of care. Authorization for utilization will be IAW USAF Pararescue Medication andProcedure Handbook. 2.4.  Squadron Commanders: 2.4.1.  Coordinate with host MTF to ensure adequate support in the acquisition of medicationsrequired for mission support. 14AFI16-1204   16 OCTOBER 20062.4.2.

Pre-scribed controlled substances must be documented in either the SF 600 or the PJ/CRO Consolidated Mis-sion Report and must be reported to the units’ medical logistics upon return. Inspect controlled substances for adequate quality and quantity prior to turn-in. If discrepancies are noted,report discrepancies to the CMIC/CSIO immediately 2.9.  Storage of Controlled Medications.  2.9.1.  All controlled medical items require special protection. Squadron commanders and CMICs willensure that controlled medical items are properly stored and that storage areas meet the criteria in MILHDBK 1191 for caged or vault storage space and in AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation SecurityProgram (FOUO Publication available only through local Security Forces Squadron). 2.9.2.  CMICs will evaluate the adequacy of the vault and caged storage areas annually. At the requestof the CMIC, the chief of security police and the base civil engineer may assist in the evaluation.Report deficiencies to the squadron commander for corrective action. 2.9.3.  For secure storage areas equipped with intrusion detection systems or duress alarm systems, theCMIC in coordination with appropriate base agencies will periodically check the system as requiredby AFI 31-101 and local installation policy. Record the test results on AF IMT 2530, Alarm SystemTest Record, or an automated system that meets the requirements of AF IMT 2530. Make the resultsavailable for verification during any inspection. 2.9.4.  The CMIC will take the following minimum precautions in safeguarding the storage and issueof code "R" and "Q" items: 2.9.4.1.  A vault or safe protected by a combination type lock constructed as an integral part of thevault/safe door or by combination padlock will be used to store operating and WRM stock. Safeswill be placed in limited access areas. When a combination padlock is used, the hasp to which thepadlock is fastened will be securely attached to the door and frame in such a manner as to precludejimmying or prying. SF Form 701 Activity Security Checklist and SF Form 702 Security Con-tainer Check Sheet will be properly posted and maintained within the safe or vault. 2.9.4.2.  Only the CMIC will know the combination. Place a copy of the combination in a sealedenvelope marked “For Use in Emergency Only” and keep it in a safe or safe type filing cabinetwhich is not used for “TOP SECRET” storage and which provides at least the same degree of pro-tection as the controlled substance storage area. The container for the combination will be in alocation other than the controlled substance storage area. No other copies of the combination arepermitted. The medical materiel NCOIC will establish operating instructions to be followed dur-ing alert response, or in case of an emergency when additional controlled substances are requiredto support a mission. 2.9.4.3.  Code Q items should be stored in safes or vaults. When available vault or safe storagecapacity is inadequate, code Q items may be stored in locked cages or secure rooms with con-trolled access. Start action immediately to obtain the needed additional safe or vault space. AFI16-1204   16 OCTOBER 2006172.9.4.4.  Controlled items within WRM programs that are activated will be controlled in the samemanner as in garrison assets where possible. As a minimum, items will be secured in locked roomsor containers. 2.9.4.5.  The combination to vaults or safes will be changed annually or upon relief, transfer, sep-aration, or discharge of anyone having the combination, or if there is suspicion that an unautho-rized individual has knowledge of the combination. 2.9.5.  Controlled substances issued to individual pararescue personnel will be stored in individualmailboxes. Units that don’t have the mailbox system will use their current methods of safeguardingthe alert response controlled medications until receipt and installation of a mailbox system. 2.9.5.1.  Mount mailboxes inside a vault or in a limited access room to meet the requirements ofdouble lock and key for controlled substances. The limited access room will be secured from entryusing limited key control or padlock/cipher lock. 2.9.5.2.  Pararescue personnel will sign for one key to assigned mailbox using AF IMT 2431Aerospace Ground Equipment Status or equivalent. A log will be utilized to perform key inven-tories. Store extra keys in a sealed envelope marked “For Use in Emergency Only” and keep it ina safe or safe type filing cabinet which is not used for “TOP SECRET” storage and which providesat least the same degree of protection as the controlled substance storage area. No other copies ofthe keys are permitted. If a key or keys are lost, misplaced, or stolen, replace affected locks or cyl-inders at once 2.9.5.3.  Controlled substances will be stored in assigned mailboxes. Other medications may alsobe stored in the same box. 2.9.6.  Control substances will be retrieved on an as needed basis. Whenever the mission is complete,terminated, or otherwise over, the controlled substances will be immediately returned to the mailboxupon return to the base. 2.9.7.  Storage of Other Medications. Precautions will be taken in storing all other medication andmedical kits. Medications will be properly secured. Storage in safes or vaults is desirable, however,when space limitations preclude this type of storage, the item will be stored in locked cabinets, cages,or secure rooms and access limited to selected individuals. Medications will not be left unsecuredunless medical materiel personnel are working in view of the medications. 2.9.8.  The medical materiel NCOIC will annually evaluate the adequacy of the storage areas. At therequest of the CMIC, the chief of security police and the base civil engineer may assist in the evalua-tion. Report deficiencies to the squadron commander for corrective action. 2.9.9.  During TDY/deployments, controlled substances will be safeguarded using the following pro-cedures: 2.9.9.1.  At a TDY/deployment location, medications should be stored at the local base medicalfacility, or security police office (must allow 24 hour access). 2.9.9.2.  In the absence of an approved safe/vault, or storage area in the alert facility, Rescue Coor-dination Center (RCC), or other areas that allows adequate alert response; controlled substanceswill be maintained on individual pararescuemen. 2.9.9.3.  Controlled substances may be stored on board mission aircraft if the controlled sub-stances are either in a hi-valued bin; or placed in a standard weapons storage container if the con-18AFI16-1204   16 OCTOBER 2006tainer is solely for medication storage. Either container must be secured to a floor tie down ringand the container hasp secured with a combination lock. NOTE: The combination may only begiven to the aircraft commander, if required. 2.9.9.4.  The pararescue team leader or team member who signed for the controlled medicationsmust be present on the aircraft any time controlled substances are in the bin and the bin is beingopened for access to other equipment in the bin. 2.9.9.5.  A daily inspection of the controlled substances stored on any aircraft is required. Loss ortheft of controlled substances at a Temporary Duty (TDY)/deployment location will be immedi-ately reported to the commander of the storage facility, and to the home station squadron com-mander. An investigation will be initiated immediately. 2.9.9.6.  Medications should not be stored aboard the aircraft when extremes of temperature(below 40 degrees Fahrenheit or above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, unless specified otherwise by themanufacturer) are anticipated. Under these conditions, the medications should be stored at theTDY/deployment base medical facility or in a container, which meets the temperature require-ments of this paragraph. 2.10.  Documentation of Controlled Substances. Establish records by the fiscal year. Maintain docu-mentation (in vault or safe) with controlled substances for a period of three years from date of last entry.Do not remove records from the storage area, except under the personal supervision of the controlledmedical item custodian. The following records constitute accountability of controlled substances: 2.10.1.  Monthly, semi-annual, annual and biennial inventories. 2.10.2.  Record of all turn-ins, records of issue from host medical logistics and destruction documents. 2.10.3.  AF IMT 105F-2. 2.10.4.  Any item that is administered, wasted, contaminated, dropped, etc. will be documented with abrief explanation written and signed by the responsible PJ and team leader as a witness. If the teamleader is not available or if the team leader is the one who experienced the loss, then the witness mustbe of a higher rank. The medical materiel NCOIC will be notified and given documentation as asource document. Appropriate local procedures will be initiated. 2.10.5.  Documentation of Other Medications. For bench stock materiel not managed under the WRMprogram, in-house procedures will be established to ensure control and replacement of outdated, obso-lete, or re-called medications and other dated materiel. 2.11.  Inventory of Controlled Substances.  2.11.1.  The CSIO will complete required controlled substance inventory actions as specified in thisAFI in conjunction with the medical logistics NCOIC. 2.11.2.  The CSIO will inventory controlled substances; enter results in the “Sign-In/Sign-Out” log-book. Identify action by the word 'inventory'. Ensure all receipts, issues, turn-ins, and destructions areentered in the “Sign-In/Sign-Out” logbook and that balance corresponds. NOTE: Controlled medica-tions that have been turned in for destruction or inventory require signed documentation from the per-son receiving the medications. Receipts will be stored in the logbook for a period of three years. AFI16-1204   16 OCTOBER 2006192.11.3.  The medical logistics NCOIC and/or medical NCO/designated PJ will witness the inventoryand initial beside the CSIO signature. 2.11.4.  Anytime discrepancies are noted, they will be investigated and resolved immediately. 2.12.  Destruction of Controlled Substances. The following procedures may be used to destroy all typesof medical materiel or account for materiel that is turned-in to the host medical logistics. Coordinate withhost medical logistics prior to turn-in. NOTE: Controlled medications that have been turned in fordestruction or inventory require signed documentation from the person receiving the medications.Receipts will be stored in the logbook for a period of three years. 2.12.1.  A destruction document will be prepared by the medical materiel NCOIC and used as a sourcedocument for subsequent processing. A manually prepared DD Form 1348-6, Single Line Item Req-uisition System Document, DoD (Manual-Long Form) or similar form will be used. Assign a doc-ument number to the destruction document using the current julian date and serial number. Eachseparate destruction document will have a separate document number. 2.12.2.  Identification and quantity of items destroyed, reason, manner, and date of destruction mustbe shown and certified by the CSDO. 2.12.3.  Two disinterested individuals will witness the destruction. These witnesses will not be oflesser grade than the destruction officer. The following witness statement will be placed on the backof the document and signed by the CSDO and two witnesses: “I have witnessed on this date thedestruction of the materiel described on this document, in the quantity and manner indicated”. 2.12.4.  Destroy the materiel in a manner that precludes the re-use of any portion of the item for anypurpose. Items such as needles and syringes must be unrecognizable as well as unusable. Needles andsyringes utilized in the field will be stored in a sharps tube and returned to the medical materiel sectionfor disposal. 2.12.5.  The medical logistics NCOIC will coordinate destruction methods with the resident or com-mand Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) and annotate the coordination with the BEE on the docu-ment. 2.12.6.  The medical logistics NCOIC will annotate the destruction of controlled substance in the“Sign-In/Sign-Out” logbook. 2.12.7.  File destruction document with other controlled substance documentation for a period of threeyears. 2.13.  Rotation of Stock. Procedures will be established by the medical logistics NCOIC to ensure maxi-mum rotation of medications is accomplished. Coordinate with host medical logistics for support. 2.14.  Theft and Pilferage. All warehouse doors will have locks. Restrict unauthorized personnel fromall storage areas. Where possible, make arrangements with the security police to periodically check exte-rior doors and windows of the medical supply facilities during non-duty hours. 2.15.  Transportation of Controlled Substances. The remarks section of administrative orders willinclude a statement authorizing personnel to carry professional gear e.g., medical kits containing variousmedications including controlled substances. It is best to list an inventory of specific medications actuallytransported. If this is not possible, list “Narcotics Courier” on the orders of all personnel potentially able20AFI16-1204   16 OCTOBER 2006to carry controlled substances. Also note, that some countries are concerned about manufactured drugsfrom over the counter medications i.e. Sudafed. CARROL H.
