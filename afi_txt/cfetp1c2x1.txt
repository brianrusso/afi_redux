This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, minimum core task requirements and a defined career path.  Using the guidance provided in the CFETP ensures individuals receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts. Both parts are used to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints.  Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, task technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, core tasks, and correspondence course requirements: Section B contains the course objective list/training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support materials.  An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP), which may be developed to support proficiency training. These packages are identified on the AF publishing website, http:/www.e-publishing.af.mil/; Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses; Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  3  ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Skills Training Course (ASTC).

Purpose.  This CFETP provides the information necessary for the Career Field Manager (CFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, qualifications, upgrade, and advanced and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, or 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are: 1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method. 1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2. Uses.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty. 2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the CFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into plan. 2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  Lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The CFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AETC training manager for this specialty will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.   8  Section B – Career Progression and Information  4. Specialty Description.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training must do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career. 5.1.  Apprentice (3) Level. The Combat Control Apprentice attends the ASTC for completion of 5-skill level training objectives. While in the ASTC the apprentice may participate in joint exercises, contingencies, force projection, and if specifically required, combat and humanitarian operations.  Participates in team combat readiness, continuation, qualification and enlisted specialty training.  Prepares equipment to meet mission requirements including communications equipment, vehicles, static line parachutes, and other mission equipment.  Participates in training programs to satisfy EST and QT requirements.  They will utilize the Career Development Course (CDC) and Task Qualification Training and work with trainers and mentors to enhance their knowledge and skills. Once task certified, a trainee may perform the task unsupervised. Promotion to Airman (AMN) normally occurs within the first year of service and promotion to Airman First Class (A1C) normally occurs during the second year of service. Promotion to Senior Airman (SrA) normally occurs between 24 to 36 months service.  5.2.  Journeyman (5) Level.  The ASTC is designed to finish 5-skill level upgrade training within a year (must meet minimum time in training requirements IAW AFI 36-2201 Volume 2 prior to upgrading) and is followed with a PCS or PCA to an operational unit. Five-skill levels will normally attend an Airman Leadership School (ALS) after assuming the rank of SrA and completing 48 months of service, upon first reenlistment, or when selected for promotion to Staff Sergeant (SSgt). Completion of an ALS is mandatory prior to assuming the rank of SSgt.  A 5-level is required for promotion to SSgt.  Air National Guard (ANG) may substitute a non-resident ALS.  Promotion to SSgt normally occurs near the five-year point of service.  Once individuals have completed an ALS, they are authorized to supervise personnel.  Once upgraded to the 5-skill level, a journeyman will enter into continuation training to broaden their experience base and will begin training to 7-skill level tasks.  Although a journeyman has been trained and certified to perform designated tasked unsupervised at the 5- level, he will normally deploy and operate in the team member capacity.  Individuals will use their CDCs to prepare for testing under the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  They should also consider continuing their education toward a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree. 5.3.  Craftsman (7) Level.  A craftsman can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions.  A craftsman is the most technically proficient operator and will be expected to deploy and operate independently as well as in the role of a team leader.  Individuals should attend advanced qualification courses to allow them to operate as a team leader.  They will also be assigned to work in staff positions.  7-skill levels should take courses or obtain added knowledge on management of resources and personnel.  Promotion to Technical Sergeant (TSgt) normally occurs near the 11-year point of service.  Individuals must attend an NCO  10  Academy (NCOA) when selected for or after assuming the rank of TSgt.  Promotion to Master Sergeant (MSgt) normally occurs near the 15-year point of service.  Prior to assuming the rank of MSgt, individuals must complete the NCOA in residence.  ANG may substitute a non-resident NCOA Course.  Completion of CCAF degree programs is recommended.  Once selected for MSgt, completion of the SNCOA by correspondence is encouraged. 5.4.  Superintendent (9) Level.  A 9-skill level can be expected to fill positions of greater responsibility and should seek additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources and personnel management through continuing education.  Promotion to SMSgt normally occurs near the 20-year point of service.   Active duty individuals must complete the Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy (SNCOA) in residence prior to assuming the rank of SMSgt. ANG may substitute the non-resident SNCOA Course. 5.5.  Combat Control Manager (0) Level.  This individual will be awarded AFSC 1C200 once selected for Chief Master Sergeant (CMSgt). Promotion to CMSgt normally occurs near the 23-year point of service.    6.  Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Combat Control specialty.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  The following training decisions were based on a STRT and a U&TW held at Lackland AFB on 18-21 October 2011 and 19-22 June 2012 respectively and changes to the 1C1X1 apprentice course beginning in October, 2008.  Key training decisions from the STRT and U&TW involved adding specific line items for landing zone establishment and landing zone safety officer duties, stress inoculation and resiliency training.  It identifies more stringent fitness progression requirements and developmental water skills training for the apprentice training pipeline. The 1C1X1 apprentice course will now include tower and radar for all trainees. The CFM is the authority for waiving any mandatory training requirement(s).  Process waiver requests to the CFM as described in AFI 36-2201, Volume 5. 6.1. Apprentice Training.  The apprentice-training pipeline was adjusted to address training deficiencies. Specifically, progressive rucksack training standards were reduced and standardized to better prepare trainees for follow-on courses in the pipeline.  Fitness standards were adjusted to provide a science-based progression from the adjusted PAST standards, effective 1 July 2011, and development water skills were incorporated to ensure trainees are prepared for ASTC mandatory requirements.  Additionally major changes to the Combat Control Operator Course (ATC Course) were incorporated adding radar to the curriculum. These changes were driven by the 1C1X1 career field.  In the most expeditious manner, the Combat Control Apprentice pipeline provides: Screening to prepare Combat Control trainees physically and mentally for the rigors of the training pipeline; Air Traffic Control Training (Combat Control Operator Courses); Basic jump training (Army Airborne); water survival; helicopter dunker training; and Combat Survival Training.  These qualification courses are mandatory prerequisites for entry into the AFSC awarding course. The Combat Control Apprentice course provides individuals with knowledge and hands-on training that prepares them for the ASTC with apprentice 3-skill level skills.   6.1.1.  Apprentice Physical Training. Physical conditioning is a cornerstone of combat effectiveness. The Combat Control pipeline emphasizes physical training to assure that apprentice course graduates have the strength and endurance to meet the intense physical challenges inherent in the 5- level upgrade process and the CCT specialty.  Efficient training of Combat Controllers from course of initial entry (COIE) through Apprentice (3-skill level) and  11  Journeyman (5-skill level) is a complex, multi-command effort. The standards described in table 6.1 and table 6.2 support STS tasks 1.3.4. Physical Training, 1.3.5 Perform Surface Swimming, and 1.3.6 Perform progressive surface/sub-surface water skill training as these tasks apply to the apprentice pipeline. Events will be administered in the sequence and manner specified for PAST test procedures published on the HQ AETC/A3T portal page.

Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies specialty-wide training requirements. 2.2.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Column 3 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.  See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit training manager for current CDC listings.   2.3.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 4 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use automated training management systems to conduct technical qualifications if available.  Task certification (and initials) is no longer required for core and critical tasks. 2.4.  Qualitative Requirements.  The Proficiency Coding System indicates the level of training and knowledge provided by all resident training courses and career development courses.  This coding system represents the contract between the CFM and the course providers.   2.5.  Job Qualification Standard.  This becomes a Job Qualification Standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record Folder, and used according to AFI 36-2201, Chapter 6.  For current documentation, decertification, recertification and transcribing procedures see AFI 36-2201 Chapter 6.   2.5.1.  Documentation.  Document completion of training.  Identify duty position requirements by circling the subparagraph number or letter next to the task statement.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. 2.5.1.1.  Converting from Old Document to new CFETP.   For all tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, evaluate current qualifications and when verified, recertify using current date, as completion date and enter trainee’s and trainer’s initials.  When transcribing previous certification for tasks not required in the current duty position, carry forward only the previous completion date of certification (not the initials of another person).  If and when transcribed tasks become duty position requirements, recertify using standard certification procedures. 2.6.  Training Standard.  All tasks required in the current duty position are trained to the Go/No Go level.  Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of phraseology and procedures.  For ATC training, CCT/1C2X1 will attend the ATC School and use the 1C1X1STS for this portion of their training 2.7.  The CFETP Part II.  This is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.
