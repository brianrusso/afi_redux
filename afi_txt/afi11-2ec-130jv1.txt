See    AFI    11-202    Vol    2,    initial    instructor    evaluation,    for    evaluation  requirements. 1.9.2.  Units  send  proposed  initial  cadre  list  by  name,  rank,  current  crew  position  and  aircraft,  total  flying  time,  and  requested  crew  qualification  level  through  channels  to  AFSOC/A3  and  NGB/A3O  for  approval.    (T-2) 1.9.2.1.  Following  final  approval,  publish  a  squadron  letter  to  identify  initial  cadre  instructors  and  flight  examiners  by  aircraft  and  crew  qualification  and  file  in  each  cadre  individual‘s  FEF.    (T-2) 1.9.2.2.  If    a    check    ride    was    accomplished,    enter    appropriate    comments    in    the  remarks  section  of  AF  Form  8  explaining  the  individual‘s  status  as  initial  cadre  instructor  or  flight  examiner.    (T-2) 1.9.3.  Initial  cadre  is  not  required  for  minor  aircraft  modifications  when  any  required  training    for    that    modification    is    provided    by    the    contractor    and/or    can    easily    be  accomplished  in-unit.    Conduct  differences  training  for  the  new  equipment  and  log  training  on  the  letter  of  Xs  or  Memo  for  Record  (MFR).    (T-2)    Aircrew  members  will  not  fly  with  new  equipment  until  trained.    (T-2) 1.10.  Unit    Aircrew    Capability.  Squadrons    will    maintain    MR    status    on    all    primary  aircrew   members  up   to  unit   authorizations.     Commanders  will  train   aircrews  to   meet  capabilities  specified   in  unit  Deigned   Operational  Capability   (DOC)  statements.     (T-3)    Supervisory    aircrew    and    staff    members    assigned    above    squadron    level,    which    are    in  excess    of    the    unit’s    mission    requirements,    will    maintain    MR,    basic    mission    capable  (BMC),  or  basic  aircraft  qualification  status,  as  required.    (T-3)    Note:    To  change  from  BMC  to  MR  status,  a  crewmember  will  begin  maintaining  full  MR  flying  currency.    The  unit  commander  may  assign  additional  training,  as  desired. 1.10.1.  Commanders  will   not   assign   additional   duties   to   first    assignment   “pipeline”  (directly  out  of  formal  MDS  training)  crewmembers  (officer  and  enlisted)  for  their  first  6  months  in  the  unit.    (T-3)    First  assignment  crewmembers  in  any  AFSOC  weapon  system  should  not  be  given  an  additional  duty  for  the  first  6  months  in  the  unit.        This    policy    allows    pipeline    students    to    learn    the    weapon    system    without  distraction  of  an  additional  duty;  however,  first  assignment  senior  personnel  may  be  assigned  additional  duties. 1.10.2.  Aircrew  members  will  not  perform  long  term  duties  which  detract  from  the  primary  duties  of  training  for,  or  performing  the  unit  flying  mission.    (T-3) 1.10.3.  ACC  Currency   Requirements.    Permanent   Party  aircrew   assigned   to   the  34  WPS  USAFWS  as  instructors  must  maintain   at   least    BMC  flying   currency   in   the    18  AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011 portions    of    the    mission    they    will    instruct.        Unit    commanders    may    direct    specific  individuals    to    maintain    only    partial    BMC    qualifications.        In    such    cases,    the  crewmember    will    require    only    those    currency    items    associated    with    this    tailored  qualification.    The  individual’s  AF  Form  8  will  indicate  applicable  restrictions  based  on    assignments    of    less    than    full    mission    qualification.        If    34    WPS    crewmembers  augment  operational  units,  the  gaining  unit  commander  must  be  provided  a  detailed  list  of  the  individual’s  current  training  status.    The  individual  must  comply  with  MR  training   requirements  of  the   gaining  unit  or   pursue  applicable  waivers  through  the  operational  unit’s  MAJCOM/A3.    The  gaining  unit  or  MAJCOM  may  levy  additional  requirements    as    desired.        Chapter    4,    of    this    instruction,    outlines    exceptions    to  continuation    currency    training    requirements    for    these    personnel.        Note:        For    the  purposes  of  this  instruction,  enlisted  aircrew  members  assigned  to  the  34  WPS  are  not  considered  USAFWS  instructors.    (T-2) 1.11.  Changes.  Recommendations    for    improvement    to    this    instruction    are    encouraged.    Send    recommendations    to    193    OSF/OST,    on    an    AF    Form    847,    Recommendation    for  Change  of  Publication.    193  OSF/OST  will  coordinate  all  changes  through  193  OG/OGV  and  HQ  AFSOC/A3T.

Overview.  This  chapter  outlines for  Basic  Aircraft Qualification  (BAQ)  training  which  may  be  completed  via  initial  qualification,  requalification, conversion, or differences training.  Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification training should be minimized. the  minimum requirements 2.1.1.  Qualification  training  provides  the  training  necessary  to  initially  qualify  aircrew members  in  a  basic  crew  position  and  flying  duties  without  regard  to  the  unit’s  mission.  Upon completion of qualification training, the aircrew member attains BAQ status.  BAQ is a prerequisite for Mission Qualification Training (outlined in Chapter 3). 2.2.  General  Requirements.  The  primary  method  of  initial  qualification  and  requalification training is the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA.  If no requalification course exists, conduct requalification using the initial qualification course.  Completing the appropriate formal  course  satisfies  the  training  requirements  of  this  chapter.    When  attendance  is  not practical  or  quotas  are  not  available,  units  may  request  secondary  method  in-unit  qualification training  waivers  IAW  paragraph  1.4.1.    Any  aircrew  member  who  has  previously  failed  to successfully complete the ETCA formal course for substandard performance will not be issued a secondary method training waiver. 2.3.  Training  Prerequisites.  Course  prerequisites  are  IAW  the  appropriate  formal  course syllabus, the ETCA, AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, and this instruction.  The formal school SOI designates the course prerequisite approval authority. 2.4.  Ground    Training   Requirements.  Complete  all  required  ground  training  IAW  AFI  11  202,  Vol.  1,  and  applicable  RTM  prior  to  certifying  individuals  as  MR.    Completion  of    training    will    establish    due    dates    for    recurring    ground    training.        (T-2)        All  crewmembers    must    complete    crew    resource    management,    aircrew    flight    equipment  familiarization,  emergency  egress,  flight  physical,  physiological,  local  area  survival,  and  emergency  parachute  training,prior  to  the  first  flight,  as  well  as  a  flight  physical.    (T-2) Table 2.1.  DELETE.  2.4.1.  Written  Examination.    Open  and  closed  book  qualification  examinations  must  be  completed  before  the  completion  of  basic  qualification  flying  training.    Written  examinations  must  satisfy  the  requirements  of  AFI  11-202,  Vol  2  and  MDS  Volume  2.    The  formal  school  will  not  forward  their  examinations  as  part  of  the  courseware  for    in-unit    qualifications.        When    qualification    training    is    completed    by    secondary  method,    the    student    will    complete    the    appropriate    group    stan/eval    or    equivalent  examination.

Satisfactorily    completing    the    appropriate    ETCA  formal  course  satifies  the  requirements  of  this   section.    Approved  in-unit  qualification    20  AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011 training    must    be    accomplished    IAW    applicable    formal    school    courseware    and    the  guidance  below:    (T-2) 2.5.1.  Flying  training  lessons  should  be  completed  sequentially.    If  mission  scheduling  or student  progress  dictates  otherwise,  in-unit  training  sequences  may  be  changed  by  the  unit Operations Officer. 2.5.2.  Aircrew  member  upgrade  and  special  qualification  training  requirements  may  be completed  on  training  or  operational  missions  under  the  supervision  of  an  instructor  in  the same aircrew position.  Comply with restrictions in AFI 11-2EC-130J, Vol. 3. 2.6.  Basic  Aircraft  Qualification  Conversion/Differences   Training.  Conversion  training  is    normally    associated    with    training    between    MDS   (e.g.    C-21    to   C-130).        Difference  training  is   conducted   when  training  in   a  different   series   aircraft  in  the  same  mission  design  (e.g.  C-130E  to  C-130H3).    Use  difference  training  when  changing  between  same  design    aircraft    and    the    amount    of    training    needed    for    qualification    does    not    warrant  attendance  at  a  formal  qualification  course.    (T-2)    Additionally,  accomplish  difference  training  when  an  aircraft  is  modified  and  any  required  training  for  that  modification  can  easily    be    accomplished    in-unit.        (T-3)        BAQ    difference    training    qualifies    an    aircrew  member  to  be  a  basic  aircrew  member.    Primary  method  for  differences  training  is  via  completion  of  a  formal  school  transition  course  (TX).    If  a  TX  course  is  not  available,  the    alternate    method    is    via    in    unit    ground    and    flight    training    IAW    MAJCOM/A3T  approved  AF  Form  4111,  satisfactory  completion  of  the  qualification  written  open/closed  examinations,    and    instructor    certification    on    the    AF    Form    4348    for    the    new    aircraft.    Aircrew  members  entered  into  differences  training  will  complete  training  within  180  days  (12  months  for  AFRC  and  ANG)  after  the  first  flight  of  the  training  program.    (T-2)    BAQ  Differences  training  is  authorized  per  Table 2.2. 2.6.1.  For  basic  aircraft  instrument/qualification  purposes,  the  EC-130J,  C-130J,  MC-130J  and  C-130J-30  are  considered  to  be  the  same  mission  design.    Training  between  the  C-130J  variants  and  any  other  C-130  variant  is  conversion  training  and  will  be  accomplished  via  a  formal  course  at  an  FTU  or  via  SMT.    (T-2) 2.6.2.  Upon  completion  of  differences  training  and  certification  on  the  AF  Form  4348,  the aircrew  member  is  Basic  Aircraft  Qualified  (BAQ)  in  the  new  aircraft.    Aircrew  members may maintain previous C-130 instructor/evaluator, air-to-air refueling (AAR) and Maximum Effort  qualifications  at  the  discretion  of  the  unit  commander.    Other  crew  position qualifications (i.e. mission instructor) are attained through the procedures in Chapter 5. 2.6.3.  Aircrew  members  training  to  an  MDS,  not  specifically  listed  in  paragraph 2.6 or    Table  2.2    must    complete    conversion    training.        Conversion    training    requires    the  completion  of  the  formal  school  initial  qualification  course.    (T-2) 2.6.4.  Multiple    Qualification.        Aircrew    members    will    attend    a    formal    initial  qualification  or  TX  course  to  gain  basic  aircraft  qualification  in  another  MDS  unless  authorized    difference    training    per    paragraph  2.6.        (T-2)        For    approved    secondary  method  training,  request  courseware  IAW  paragraph 1.4. Table 2.2.  Basic Aircraft Qualification Differences Training.

Overview.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  training  requirements  for  completing mission qualification and requalification.  Aircrew members completing mission qualification or requalification  will  meet  the  requirements  of  this  chapter.    Upon  completion  of  mission qualification training, the aircrew member will be assigned either Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or Mission Ready (MR) status. 3.2.  General  Requirements.  The  primary  method  of  mission  qualification  is  to  complete  the appropriate  formal  training  course  listed  in  the  ETCA.    When  attendance  is  not  practical  or quotas  are  not  available,  units  may  request  waivers  to  conduct  secondary  method  mission qualification  training  using  formal  school  courseware.    The  secondary  method  requires  use  of formal school courseware and a waiver from the appropriate waiver authority as listed in Table 1.1  This courseware establishes the minimum training requirements to meet standards specified in  AFI  11-2EC-130J,  Vol.  2.    Units  may  supplement  courseware  to  meet  local  requirements.  Submit all courseware change requests to NGB/A3O prior to implementation. 3.3.  Training  Prerequisites.  Course  prerequisites  are  IAW  the  appropriate  formal  course syllabus, the ETCA, AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, and this instruction.  The formal school SOI designates the course prerequisite approval authority. 3.3.1.  This  does  not  preclude  simultaneous  basic  qualification  and  mission  qualification training.    Simultaneous/Concurrent  Multiple-MDS  qualification  upgrades  will  not  be accomplished. 3.3.2.  If    there    is    not    a    separate    mission    requalification    course,    aircrew    members  requalifying  in   the  units   mission  will  comply   with   the  initial   mission  qualification  course  prerequisites.    (T-2) 3.3.3.  For  the  minimum  requirements  to  be  trained  as  a  Mission  Pilot  (MP)  refer  to  Table 5.1   If the requirements  of the table are not  met,  train  and evaluate the individual as a MC unless excepted below. 3.3.3.1.  Prior Qualified Pilots (PQP, e.g. FAIP, OSA, etc.) with at least  800 hours total flying time will be trained in the left seat and evaluated as a MP.  PQP pilots trained as an MP with less than the required C-130 experience will fly in-unit as an MP until they have the required PMAI flight time.  Units will follow Requalification procedures in Chapter 4 to requal those pilots as MPs. 3.3.3.2.  Prior Qualified Pilots (PQP, e.g. FAIP, OSA, etc.)  with less than 800 hours total flying time will be trained and evaluated as an MC. 3.4.  Ground    Training    Requirements.  Complete    all    ground    training    required    per    the  RTM  as  part  of  mission  qualification  training  or  prior  to  certifying  individuals  as  mission  ready.        Completion    of    training    will    establish    due    dates    for    recurring    ground    training  required.    Credit  any  training  accomplished  at  a  formal  school.    Qualified  mission  ready  aircrew  members  transferred  from   other  units  require  only  unit  specific  mission  ready  training  events  or  events  which  are  due/overdue. AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011   23  3.4.1.  Academic  Training.    Complete  all  academic  and  ground  training  delineated  in applicable  courseware.    If  not  included  in  the  course  syllabus,  accomplish  the  minimum requirements listed in AFI 11-202, Vol 1, seperately. 3.4.2.  Written    Examination.        Crewmembers    must    complete    a    written    examination  before  the  end  of  mission  qualification  flying  training.    (T-2)    Formal  school  End  of  Course  examinations,  Group  Stan/Eval  or  equivalent  examinations  for  SMT  satisfy  this  requirement.    The  formal  school  will  not  forward  their  examinations  as  part  of  the  courseware  for  inunit  qualifications. 3.4.3.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 1, AFSOC Sup for Flight Surgeon (FS), Medical Technician, and Combat Camera Aerial Photographer Training requirements. Table 3.1.  DELETE. 3.5.  Flying    Training    Requirements.  Satisfactorily    completing    the    appropriate    ETCA  formal  course  satifies  the  requirements  of  this   section.    Approved  in-unit  qualification  training    must    be    accomplished    IAW    applicable    formal    school    courseware    and    the  guidance  below:    (T-2) 3.5.1.  Flying  training  lessons  should  be  completed  sequentially.    If  mission  scheduling  or student  progress  dictates  otherwise,  in-unit  training  sequences  may  be  changed  by  the  unit operations officer. 3.5.2.  There  should  be  minimum  time  lapse  between  training  missions,  and  every  effort should be made to complete mission qualification training requirements within the prescribed time period. 3.5.3.  Aircrew member requirements may be completed on training or operational missions under the supervision of an instructor in the same aircrew position.  Comply with restrictions in AFI 11-2EC-130J, Vol. 3. 3.6.  Specific    Mission    Training    Requirements.  It    is    the    unit’s    intent    for    the    WSO  candidate  to  be  dual  qualified  in  both  the  CSO  (Combat  Systems  Officer)    and  MCC  (Mission  Crew  Commander)  positions;  however,  this  may  be  altered  based  on  the  needs  of  the  unit.    CSO  training  is  intended  to  be  completed  prior  to  beginning  MCC  training  to  maintain  a  fluid  course  control  and  progression  of  students.    However,  a  new  WSO  student  can  begin  the  MCC  course  if  it  is  justified  for  mission  requirements.    Also,  the  unit    will    determine    the    need    for    any    changes    to    the    above    based    upon    individual  capabilities,  instructor  availability,  or  aircraft  availability.    (T-3)    If  unit  needs  dictate,  individuals  may   only   be  qualified  in   a   single  position.    The   FTU  commandant   must  approve  this  request  prior  to  beginning  the  course.    (T-3)    ECS  Operators  are  normally  qualified  to  operate  the  HF,  MF,  NB,  WB,  and  PT  positions.    However,  based  on  unit  needs  and  individual  capabilities,  single  seat  qualifications  are  at  the  discretion  of  the  FTU  and  SQ/CC.    (T-3) 3.6.1.  Aircrew  members  qualified  and  current  in  special  mission  events  may  maintain  that qualification, once they are mission qualified in their new aircraft.   24  AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General Requirements. 4.1.1.  Requirements  in  this  chapter  and  any  applicable  RTMs  satisfy  the  minimum  flying and related ground training to maintain  currency and the assigned training status.  Individual proficiency may require a greater number of events.  Failure to accomplish these continuation training requirements will not affect BMC or MR status but may entail additional training as determined by the Sq/CC. 4.1.2.  Training  requirements  may  be  completed  on  any  sortie  if  the  accrediting  criteria  of this instruction are met.  Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the same flight. 4.1.3.  Aircrew  members  will  not  log  continuation  training  requirements  in  events  in  which they are unqualified. 4.1.4.  Training events accomplished on a evaluation or an instructor certification (that event) may be credited toward the individual’s volume requirements. 4.1.5.  Flying  training  events  accomplished  during  formal  training  will  use  the  course completion  date  (successful  evaluation  date)  to  establish  the  due  dates  for  all  subsequent currency and requirements.  Use actual dates for ground training.  Certification events trained to a 3C in the FTU will use the date of the checkride as the initial accomplishment date. 4.1.6.  Aircraft flying training requirements may be accomplished in a aircrew training device (ATD) as noted in Table 4.4. and Table 4.5. 4.2.  Training Levels (TL).  The  use  of  experienced  based  Flight  Training  Levels  (FTLs)  and  Ground  Training  Levels  (GTLs)  allows  the  squadron  commander  to  prioritize  training  resources.  Aircrew  members  must  meet  the  minimum   criteria  established  in  paragraph 4.2.1,    and    Table  4.1,    of    this    instruction,    before    assignment    to    the    respective    training  level.     (T-3)    When  these  minima  are  met,  awarding  a  training  level   is   at   the  sole  discretion  of  the  squadron  commander.    Note:    The  aircrew  member’s  availability  to  fly  should  not  be  a  factor  in  assigning  a  TL. 4.2.1.  FTLs are based on minimum primary aircraft assigned (PAA) time and total time.  For basic qualification FTL,  PAA time will include any variant  of C-130J.  (Units with  C-130J variant  aircraft  assigned  and  who  fly  continuation  training  events  in  those  aircraft  may include time in those aircraft as PAA). 4.2.1.1.  FTL “A”-Highly experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members. 4.2.1.2.  FTL “B”-Experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members. 4.2.1.3.  FTL “C”-Inexperienced BAQ and MR aircrew members. Table 4.1.

Aircrew members may be assigned different FTLs for basic and mission qualifications and events.   For  example, an aircraft commander coming from AC-130s might  be assigned basic FTL “A”, mission FTL “C” with a caveat of FTL “A” for AAR. 4.2.3.  Change    of    FTL.        Once    a    semiannual    period    begins,    personnel    will    not    be  moved  to  a  level  requiring  fewer  events  until  the  next  semiannual  period.    However,  aircrew  members  may  be  moved  to  a  level  requiring  more  events.    (T-3) 4.2.3.1.  Additional  Training.    FTLs  do  not  prevent  the  squadron  commander  from scheduling an aircrew member for additional training. 4.2.4.  GTLs are based upon operational flying experience. 4.2.4.1.  GTL “1” – Aircrew members with 5 years or greater of operational flying. 4.2.4.2.  GTL “2” – Aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying. 4.3.  Proration  of  Training    Requirements.  See    AFI    11-202,    Vol.    1,    AFSOC    Sup.    Prorate  aircrew  member  flying  training  requirements  for  individuals  following  completion  of  basic  qualification,  mission  qualification,  requalification,  and  upgrades  to  a  new  special  mission  qualification,  or  who  are  not  available  for  flying  duties  due  to  PCS,  non-flying  TDY,    DNIF,    emergency    leave,    or    other    unavoidable    circumstances    which    prevent    the  individual    from    flying.    Only    prorate    to    zero    requirements    (No    Requirements)    for    the  period  of  166  days  to  6  months  in  cases  of  qualification,  requalification,  or  upgrade.    Aircrew    members    who    enter    training    after    the    start    of    the    training    period    may    be  prorated.    Prorate  individual  requirements  based  on  the  number  of  full  calendar  months  left  in  the  training  period.    Use  Table 4.2 to  determine  the  number  of  sorties  and  events  required  for  an  individual  after  proration.    (T-2)   26  AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011 Table 4.2.

Recurrency and Requalification Training.  Training  is  required  whenever  an  aircrew  member  does  not  meet  a  currency  requirement  in  this  instruction.    (T-2)    An  aircrew  member  will  not  perform  events  unsupervised  until  training  has  been  accomplished.    (T-2)    Aircrew  members  requiring  requalification  will  accomplish  training  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol.  1,  applicable  AFSOC  or  NGB  supplements,  and  Chapters 2, 3, and 5. 4.4.1.  Recurrency  training  is  the  training  an  aircrew  member  must  accomplish,  under  the supervision of an instructor, when currency has been lost.  The event resulting in recurrency and  each  event  thereafter  are  creditable  for  the  current  training  period.    Requalification training  is  the  training  conducted,  under  the  supervision  of  an  instructor,  when  an  aircrew member is unqualified. 4.4.2.  Basic  Currency/Requalification.     Failure  to    accomplish   a   basic  currency  item  that    is    required    periodically    (as    outlined    in    the    RTM)    or    failure    to    complete    the  semi-annual  requirements  of  the  RTM  results  in  the  loss  of  basic  currency.    Basic  recurrency/requalification    training    requirements    are    shown    below.        Individual  proficiency  will  dictate  the  number  of  events  to  be  flown  with  an  instructor  or  flight  examiner  to  satisfy  sortie  delinquency  (as  a  minimum,  one  sortie  will  be  flown).    (T-3) 4.4.3.  Loss  of  Currency.    Failure  to  accomplish  events  listed  in  continuation  training  as  outlined  in  RTM  results  in  a  loss  of  currency  for  that  event.    Aircrew  members  are  non-current  the  day  after  event  currency  expires. AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011   27  4.4.3.1.  Loss  of  currency  events  as  outlined  in  the  RTM  results  in  loss  of  basic  aircraft  currency.    These  individuals  will  fly  under  the  supervision  of  an  instructor  or  flight  examiner  on  all  sorties  until  recurrent.    (T-3) 4.4.3.1.1.  Aircrew  members  who  maintain  qualification  in  their  primary  aircraft  and  a  ‗slick‘  C130J  variant  may  satisfy  RTM  currency  requirements  in  either  their    primary    aircraft    or    the    C130J.        If    basic    semiannual    currency    is    lost  (failure  to  complete  the  requirements  as  outlined  in  the  RTM),  it  is  lost   for  both  aircraft.    Lost  basic  or  semiannual  currency  may  be  regained  in  either  aircraft    or    the    simulator.        ECS    Operators    and    MCCs    can    regain    basic    or  semiannual  currency  utilizing  an  Aircrew  Training  Device  (ATD). 4.4.3.1.2.  Non-current    less    than    6    months:        Show    proficiency    in    deficient  item(s)  to  an  instructor.  In  addition,  pilots  will  perform  a  takeoff,  approach,  and  landing.    (T-3) 4.4.3.1.3.  Loss  of  currency  exceeding  6-months.    Aircrew  members  non-current  in  designated  BAQ  events  (as  noted  in  the  RTM)  in  excess  of  six  months  results  in   loss  of  BAQ.    Aircrew  members  non-current   in  designated  RTM  mission  events  in  excess  of  six  months  results  in  loss  of  mission  qualification. 4.4.4.  Regaining Currency. 4.4.4.1.  Only  events  as  noted  in  the  RTM  require  an  evaluation  (unqualified)  if  loss    of    currency    exceeds    6    months    (see    AFI    11-202,    Vol    1).        Other    events  require    showing    proficiency    to    an    instructor    in    the   aircraft,    simulator,    or    ATD  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1,  to  regain  currency.    If  loss  of  currency  exceeds  24  months  in  other  noted  RTM  events,  additional  training  will  consist  of  ground  and  flight    training    as    directed    by    the    unit    commander    (training    folder    must    be  opened).    (T-3) 4.4.4.2.  Aircrew  non-current  in  special  mission  events  which  only  require  an  instructor certification (Table 5.4.) may regain currency by showing proficiency in that event to an instructor. 4.4.4.3.  Aircrew  non-current  more  than  24  months  in  special  mission  events  (refer  to  RTM)  requiring  an  evaluation  will  complete  all  initial  training  and  evaluation  requirements  for  that  special  mission.    (T-2) 4.4.5.  Requalification Training.  Reference AFI 11-202, Vol. 1 as supplemented, to compute the expiration date of qualification and determine the required training to become requalified. Previous  instructors  in  the  EC-130J  may  re-qualify  directly  to  instructor  in  the  EC-130J unless  AFI  11-202,  Vol  1  as  supplemented  directs  accomplishment  of    initial  qualification training  (TX-1). 4.4.5.1.  Unqualified  up  to  39  months  at  the  end  of  a  non-flying  assignment  or  48  months  at  the  end  of  any  active  flying  assignment.    Crewmembers  must  complete  requalification    requirements    IAW    Chapter    2,    of    this    instruction.        Previous  instructors  in  the  EC-130J  may  re-qualify  directly  to  instructor  status  in  the  EC-130J.    (T-2)   28  AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011 4.4.6.  Core  Mission  Currency/Requalification.    Failure  to  accomplish  all  events  during  a  semiannual  period  results  in  the  loss  of  mission  currency  or  for  that  mission  event  only,  based  on  the  most  current  RTM  guidance.    Mission  recurrency/requalification  training  requirements  are  shown  below.    Loss   of  mission   currency   or  qualification  does  not  affect  basic  aircraft  currency  or  qualification. 4.4.6.1.  Non-current  less  than  6  months:    Show  proficiency  in  deficient  item(s)  to  an instructor. 4.4.6.2.  Non-current    6-24    Months    (mission    unqualified):        Mission    qualification  training  as  directed  by  193  SOS/CC,  must  include  the  following:  completion  of  a  written    mission    qualification    exam    and    mission    requalification    flight    evaluation.    (T-2)    Previous  mission  qualified  instructors  may  re-qualify  directly  to  instructor  status. 4.4.6.3.  Non-current    24-60    Months    (mission    unqualified):        Crewmembers    must  complete  mission  requalification  requirements  IAW  Chapter  3,  of  this  instruction.    Previous  mission  qualified  instructors  may  re-qualify  directly  to  instructor  status.    (T-2) 4.4.6.4.  Non-current   over  60  Months  (mission  unqualified):     Crewmembers  must  complete    initial    mission    qualification    requirements    IAW    Chapter    3    of    this  instruction.    Previous  instructors  may  not  re-qualify  directly  to  instructor  status.    (T-2) 4.4.7.  Special Mission Event Recurrency/Requalification.  Special mission event recurrency/ requalification training requirements are shown below.  For a special mission event, loss of currency/qualification  in  that  special  mission  event  does  not  affect  basic  aircraft  currency/ qualification or mission currency/qualification. 4.4.7.1.  Non-current  less  than  six  months:    Show  proficiency  in  deficient  item(s)  to  an instructor. 4.4.7.2.  Non-current greater than six months (unqualified in that special mission):  Show proficiency  in  the  deficient  item(s)  to  an  instructor,  qualified  in  the  appropriate  special mission event.  Previously qualified instructors may re-qualify directly to instructor status in special mission events, if unqualified for a period less than 60 months. 4.5.  Ground  Training.  The  RTM  designates  ground  training  requirements  for  all  aircrew  members.    Crew  members  will  comply  with  the  time  periods  listed  for  their  FTL/GTL.    (T-3)    Conduct  training   IAW  the  referenced  publications,  most  current  RTM,  and  the  guidance    below.        The    governing    directive    or    RTM    takes    precedence    over    Chapter    4  requirements.    If  the  AFI  112EC-130J,  Vol.  1  is  also  listed  as  a  governing  directive,  the  most  restrictive  guidance  should  be  followed. 4.5.1.  Failure    to    Complete    Ground    Training    Events.        Make-up    training    should    be  accomplished  at  the  earliest  opportunity.    The  following  apply  when  aircrew  members  exceed  due  dates  for  ground  training  events  as  noted  in  the  RTM. 4.5.1.1.  Grounding  items.    Aircrew  members  will  not  perform  flight  duties  until  the grounding item is satisfied. AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011   29  4.5.1.2.  Training  status  items.    Aircrew  members  will  not  fly  without  instructor supervision. 4.5.1.3.  Mission  Ready  (MR)  Items.    Failure  to  accomplish  the  events  in  Table 4.3  results  in  non-mission  ready  status  and  the  individual  will  not  deploy  as  a  crewmember.        However,    the    OG/CC    may    waive    training    requirements    IAW  paragraph 1.6.4,  this  instruction.    Squadrons  will  document  any  crewmembers  that  are  deployed  while  non-current.    (T-3) 4.5.2.  Block Training.  Each group operations training office should establish and administer a  centralized  aircrew  block  training  session.    Block  training  should  include  all  recurring ground training required to maintain readiness. 4.5.3.  Ancillary  training.    This  volume  is  not  a  comprehensive  list  of  all  ancillary  training required by the DoD.  Ancillary training parent instructions take precedence over this AFI for those  training  items.    The  ETCA  website  at  https://etca.randolph.af.mil  lists  ancillary training courses; each course lists the applicable target group. Table 4.3.  DELETE. 4.5.4.

This  chapter  identifies  the  prerequisites  and  training  requirements  for  qualified aircrew members upgrading to additional levels  of qualification and certification in  specialized flight events. 5.2.  Aircraft  Commander  Upgrade  (MPA).  Commanders    will    consider    experience,  knowledge,  and  judgment  when  identifying  candidates.    (T-3)    Nominees  must  have  an  in-depth    knowledge    of    systems,    procedures,    and    instructions    prior    to    entry    into    the  upgrade    program.        (T3)        The    upgrade    program    is    designed    to    teach    AC    duties    and  responsibilities,  as  well  as  left  seat  mission  qualification.    Once  upgraded,  the  MPA  will  return  to  FTL  C  to  gain  hours  and  experience.    (T-3)    Reference  Table  4.1. 5.2.1.  Aircraft  Commander  Upgrade  Prerequisites.    The  prerequisite  flying  time  levels  for  upgrade  in    Table  5.1 of  this  instruction  are  based  on  pilots  having  gained  the  knowledge    and    judgment    required    to    effectively    accomplish    the    unit’s    mission.    Flying    experience    should    include    left    seat    time    prior    to    entering    formal    school  upgrade  training  (Aircraft  Commander  Prepatory  Course).    AC  candidates  will  also  meet  all  prerequisites  listed  in  the  ETCA  and  the  formal  school  syllabus.    (T-2)    To  become  eligible  for  the  Aircraft  Commander  Prepatory  Course,  each  MC,  in  addition  to  obtaining  the  minimum  hours  (recommending  a  minimum  of  500  PMAI)  and  IP  recommendations,    will    maintain    a    log    of    flight    experiences    (MPA    prepatory    log)  created    by    the    193    OSF/OST.        (T-3)        This    document    will    aid    in    assessing    a  candidate’s  ability  to  accept  a  higher  responsibility  as  an  Aircraft  Commander  and  document  exposure  to  an  adequate  amount  of  mission  experiences.    Instructors  and  current  MPA  pilots  will  document  the  MC’s  log  during  post  mission  debriefs.    (T-3) Table 5.1.  Minimum  Hours  Required  to  Upgrade  to  Aircraft  Commander    (T-2).

They must be familiar with AFTTP applicable volumes. 5.3.1.7.  Instructor Pilots.  Instructor pilots are responsible at all times for the conduct of the  flight  and  safety  of  the  aircraft.    If  at  any  time  during  the  flight,  the  judgment  or proficiency of the student at the controls raises a question in the instructor’s mind as to the  student’s  ability  to  safely  complete  a  prescribed  maneuver,  the  instructor  will immediately take over the controls of the aircraft.  The instructor should then explain and demonstrate  proper  methods  of  conducting  the  maneuver  prior  to  the  student  resuming   38  AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011 control of the aircraft.  All instructors will place special emphasis on the procedures for positive  identification  of  emergency  conditions  before  initiating  corrective  action.    In addition, instructors will place a high emphasis on the procedures for positive exchange of control; these procedures will be thoroughly briefed. 5.3.1.8.  Instructor  Aircrew  Members  (Other  Than  Pilots).    Each  instructor  aircrew member  is  responsible  for  the  safe  execution  of  the  duties  of  their  respective  crew position.    At  any  time  during  the  flight,  if  the  judgment  or  proficiency  of  the  student should raise a question in the instructor’s mind as to the student’s ability to safely execute the  duties  of  the  aircrew  position,  the  instructor  will  immediately  assume  those  duties.  The instructor should then explain and demonstrate the proper method of executing those duties. 5.3.1.9.  Instructor Deficiencies.  Instructors who demonstrate deficiencies in their ability to instruct may be used in their primary crew position (provided the deficiency does not involve  primary  crew  duties).    Commanders  will  take  the  necessary  action  to  either retrain  or  remove  those  individuals  from  instructor  status  IAW  Air  Force,  AFSOC,  and ANG directives. 5.3.1.10.

JPADS  PADS  operator  (PO)  mobile  training  team  (MTT)  instructors  must  be  an  IP,  WSO/CSO,  but  are  not  required  to  be  qualified  in  the  MDS  (e.g.,  a  certified  C-130J  IP  may  perform  PADS  operator  primary  or  instructional  duties  on  a  C-130E/H).    For  non-MDS  qualified  crew  members,  log  other    time    with    crew    duty    position    as    XP.        Crewmembers    that    previously  completed    the    interim    JPADS    training    syllabus    are    considered    JPADS    certified.    All  crewmembers  will  complete  Phase  I  training.    Phase  I  Pilots  will  receive  a  JPADS  certification,  but  will  not  require  any  continuation  training.    In  addition,  crewmembers    performing    PADS    Operator    (PO)    or    loadmaster    (LM)    duties    will  complete    Phase    II    qualification    training,    and    require    continuation    training.        PO  qualification  includes  I-CDS  and  JPADS  drop  operations.    If  a  unit/MTT  does  not  have    access    to    syllabus-required    training    equipment,    instructors    will,    with    unit  CC/DO  concurrence,  determine  if  a  PO  student    has  received  sufficient  instruction  for  certification.    All  simulated  events  must  be  verbally  debriefed.    For  example,  if  a  unit  has  dropsondes  but  no  AGU,  consider  the  PO  syllabus  Wireless  Transfer  Event  complete  if  the  student  imports  dropsonde  data  and  simulates  Wireless  AGU  Data    Transfer.        LM    certification    is    split    into    I-CDS    (Phase    I)    and    JPADS  operations  (Phase  II).    LMs  that  do  not  complete  hands-on  AGU  training  will  be  certified  as  Phase  I  only  until  JPADS  Phase  II  training  is  complete.    (T-2) 5.5.2.2.

Air  Refueling  (AAR)—For the purposes of this instruction, airborne fuel onload (simulated or actual) by EC-130J receiver aircraft. Airborne  Electronic  Communications  Systems  (ECS)  Operator—An  electronic  equipment operator on an EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft whose in-flight duties involve the operation of broadcast equipment in  commercial and military radio/television frequency bands in support of the  unit’s  mission.    Also  referred  to  as  Airborne  Mission  Sytems  Specialists  (AMSS)  of  other platforms. Aircrew  Review  Board  (ARB)—The ARB is designed to provide an overview of the 193 OG training  program,  provide  a  forum  for  informal  discussions  about  current  issues,  as  well  as  to approve  upgrade  nominations  for  all  crew  positions.    193  OSF/A3T  is  responsible  to  organize,   54  AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011 and prepare minutes to document upgrade nominations that were approved.  Normally, the ARB is attended by 193 OG/CC, 193 SOS/CC, 193 SOS/DO, 193 OSF/A3T, 193 OG/OGV, and the appropriate section chief for the needs of the ARB. Backup  Aircraft  Inventory  (BAI)—Aircraft  assigned  to  a  unit  to  assist  in  maintaining readiness.  Aircraft designated as BAI assets do not receive funding or manning consideration for the unit. Basic  Aircraft  Qualification  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily completed  qualification  training  in  the  basic  aircrew  position  and  maintains  aircraft  currency IAW this instruction. Basic  Mission  Capable  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily completed  mission  qualification  and  is  maintaining  50  percent  of  the  applicable  mission qualification currency requirements of this instruction.  Basic mission capable aircrew members may perform primary crew duties on any unilateral training mission.  For other missions, the unit commander  must  determine  the  readiness  of  each  basic  mission  capable  aircrew  member  to perform primary crew duties. Calendar Month—Requirements are due once per month and not necessarily associated with a 30/60 day requirement.  For example, an aircrew member could accomplish the event on 1 February and then on 31 March the following month and still fulfill the requirement. Conversion Training—Training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.  Conversion training requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course.  For unit conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle the throughput, MAJCOMs will develop, and coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre. Core  Mission  Events—An aircrew member must  be qualified in  all core mission events  to  be considered Mission Ready (MR) or Mission Capable (MC).  To determine how non-currency in any  core  mission  event  affects  overall  mission  currency,  refer  to  the  aircraft’s  Mission  Ready Flying Requirements Table (Table 4.4.).  Loss of qualification in any core mission event results in  loss  of  overall  mission  qualification.    A  core  mission  event  will  be  considered  an  instructor certified  event  when  it  is  not  required  to  be  evaluated  on  the  Initial  Mission  Evaluation.  Squadrons  will  maintain  at  least  100  percent  of  their  required  manning  as  MR.    AFSOC  unit Squadron  Commander  and/or  Director  of  Operations  CC/DO  will  determine the status/qualification of aircrew members in excess of 100 percent manning requirement. Difference Training—Training accomplished when changing between same design aircraft and the  amount  of  training  needed  for  qualification  does  not  warrant  attendance  at  a  formal qualification course. Dual  Qualified—An  aircrew  member  who  is  qualified  in  more  than  one  crew  position  in  the same MDS. Event—A  training  item  to  be  accomplished.    Multiple  events  may  be  completed  and  logged during a sortie unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this instruction. Flight  Training  Level—The experience-based  semiannual  training requirement level  based on either flying hours or years of service. AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011   55  Formal  School  Courseware—Training materials and programs  developed for training  aircrew members  at  formal  schools.

Formation Operations—Accomplish IAW applicable volume(s) of AFSOCI 11-202, AFI 11—2EC-130J, Vol. 3, and ATP-56(B).  AFSOC guidance will never be less restrictive than the  formation  definitions  found  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  “Formation  Flight”,  “Nonstandard Formation”,  and  “Standard  Formation”.    Formation  operations  place  all  aircraft  in  a  critical phase  of  flight  which  requires  constant  vigilance,  strict  discipline,  and  polished  crew coordination for mission accomplishment.   Training  will ensure aircrew  can think  and plan for multiple aircraft instead of single ship operations. Instructor  Certified  Events—Training given to  an aircrew member that requires an instructor to certify the student's attainment of the required proficiency and knowledge levels as specified in courseware and, if appropriate, AF Forms 4111.  Instructor certified events are documented in AF Form 1381/4348. Mission  Capable  Aircrew  Member—An  aircrew  member  who  has  satisfactorily  completed mission  qualification  and  is  maintaining  currency  requirements  of  this  instruction.

General.  This    attachment    contains    the    initial    and    recurring    aircraft    CDTQT  requirements    for    AFSOC    aircrews.        The    purpose    of    CDTQT    is    to    reinforce    the  crewmember's    awareness    of    limitations    and    demonstrate    physiological    effects    while  wearing    the    aircrew    chemical    defense    ensemble    (ACDE).        The    complications    of    heat  exhaustion,  fatigue,  hyperventilation,  limited  dexterity,  and  hampered  communication  can  all  be  experienced  during  CDTQT.    All  aircrew  members  must  complete  initial  aircrew  flight  equipment  chemical  defense  training  prior  to  accomplishing  initial  CDTQT.    (T-2)    Complete  initial  disaster  preparedness  training  for  the  ground  ensemble  prior  to  CDTQT  if  the  ground  ensemble  is  used.    Initial  CDTQT  will  be  done  in  the  aircraft  and  also  done  in  the  aircraft  at  least  every  4  years.    If  initial  CDTQT  is  done  in  the  simulator,  the    next    event    must    be    logged    in    the    aircraft.        All    other    times    the    event    may    be  accomplished  in  the  simulator.    Accomplishing  the  event  in  the  aircraft  dual  logs  normal  CDTQT.    (T-2) A2.2.  CDTQT  Procedures: A2.2.1.  Accomplish  CDTQT  in-flight  using  the  primary  unit  aircraft.    Crewmembers  will  perform   primary  crew  duties  while  wearing  the  ACDE.    All   in-flight   profiles  must    be    a    minimum    of    1    hour    and    accomplished    on    training    missions    only.    Accomplish    CDTQT    in    the    simulator    using    primary    unit    aircraft    WSTs.        All  simulator    profiles    must    be    a    minimum    of    2    hours    and    flown    on    full    tactical  simulation  profiles.    This  should  include  a  threat  scenario  and  aircraft  emergencies.    (T-2)    Flying    the    simulator    profile    with    the    entire    crew    wearing    ACDE    is    highly  encouraged. A2.2.2.  The  entire  ACDE  need  not  be  used.    Normally,  wear  the  blower  assembly  unit,  inter-communication  box,  cotton  gloves,  butyl  rubber  gloves,  nomex  gloves,  and  AERPS  mask  hood  and  helmet  (if  applicable).    Either  the  ACDE  or  ground  ensemble  may    be    worn    during   aircraft    preflight.    Ground    ensembles    will   come    from   training  assets. A2.2.3.  When  wearing  the  CBO  mask,  do  not  accomplish  CDTQT  when  required  to  wear  NVGs.    When  wearing  AERPS,  NVG  events  will  be  accomplished.    (T-2) A2.2.4.  An    observer    is    required    to    monitor    each    crewmember    while    accomplishing  CDTQT  in-flight.    An  instructor  or  flight  examiner  in  each  respective  crew  position,  not    wearing    the    chemical    defense    components,    will    act    as   the    observer    for    initial  CDTQT.        Exception:       An    IP    not    wearing    the    ensemble    and    not    performing    any  other  instructor  duties  may  act  as  the  observer  for  initial  WSO/FSO  training.    During  recurring  CDTQT,  if  the  crewmember  can  be  directly  observed  by  another  primary  crewmember,  a  dedicated  observer  is   not  required.    The  dedicated  observer   during  recurring  CDTQT  may  also  wear  AERPS  for  all  crew  positions  except  pilots  (two  non-pilot  crewmembers  wearing  AERPS  may  observe  one  another).    Additionally,  for  safety  purposes,  one  crewmember  in  the  back  of  the  aircraft  must  not  be  wearing  AERPS  in  case  of  smoke  and  fumes.    (T-2)   58  AFI11-2EC-130JV1  15 SEPTEMBER 2011 A2.2.4.1.  An  instructor  or  flight  examiner  pilot  not  wearing  the  chemical  defense  components  will  occupy  the  opposite  seat  during  initial  pilot   CDTQT.    During  recurring    CDTQT,    a    mission    qualified    pilot    not    wearing    the    chemical    defense  components  will  act  as  the  observer  and  occupy  the  opposite  seat.    With  squadron  commander    approval,    both    pilots    may    wear    AERPS    while    occupying    the    pilot  seats  provided  both  pilots  have  accomplished  CDTQT  within  the  past  90  days.    The  squadron  commander  may  delegate  this  authority  to  the  operations  officer  or  mission  commander.    (T-2) A2.2.4.2.  Observers  will  closely  monitor  aircrew  members  actions  during  CDTQT.    If    an    aircrew    member    experiences    difficulties    such    as    excessive    thermal    stress,  headaches,    hyperventilation,    nausea,    etc.,    the    aircrew    member    will    remove    the  ensemble.    The  observer  will  notify  the  AC  of  any  difficulties  encountered. A2.2.4.3.  Pilots  will  accomplish  a  minimum  of  one  approach  and  landing.    Pilots  may  accomplish  CDTQT  in  either  seat. A2.2.4.4.  All   other  aircrew  members  will  credit  CDTQT  while  performing  their  normal  crew  duties  in-flight A2.3.  Mission  profile.
