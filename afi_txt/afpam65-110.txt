Disbursing Agent (DA). A disbursing agent is an agent of a Disbursing Officer (DO) or DeputyDisbursing Officer (DDO). A DA normally operates an office geographically separated from the DO/DDO’s office and is authorized to make voucher payments, voucher collections, appoint cashiers and cer-tifying officers, and maintain funding documents (e.g., AF Form 616). Because of these duties, disbursingagents should be familiar with accounts payable, disbursing, military pay, and travel pay. The DA mayalso request the commander appoint local paying agents, change fund cashiers, and imprest fund cashiers.After the commander receives the request from the DA or if the commander initiates the action for animprest fund cashier, the commander must notify the contacting office to provide oversight and training.The DA tracks daily disbursement and collection voucher processing on a DD Form 2665, Daily AgentAccountability Summary. Disbursing agents will not act as purchasing officers. 1.1.1. Officers, enlisted members, or civilian employees may be appointed as a DA. To start theappointment process, the home station commander will coordinate with the DO/DDO. The DO/DDOwill maintain the original appointment letter (refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 020602C). The let-ter will contain the name, SSN, and rank/grade of the agent; where the agent’s office will be located;description of duties; effective date of appointment; a statement the individual has been counseled onpecuniary liability and has been given written operating instructions. The agent acknowledges receiptof the appointment letter by signing the statement “I acknowledge that I am strictly liable to theUnited States for all public funds under my control”. If the individual is already a DDO, disbursingagent orders to not need to be issued. 1.2. Paying Agent (PA). A paying agent is an agent of a DO, DDO, or DA. Usually, a PA is appointed toperform certain transactions for a specific period. Examples include: making cash military pay, travel pay,prepaid vendor payments, or accommodation exchange transactions. However, a PA should not beappointed over the protest of the DO or when the transaction can be accomplished by the DO, DDO, orDA. Paying agents will not act as purchasing officers. Paying Agents will be issued funding documents(e.g., AF Form 616). 1.2.1. Officers, enlisted members, or civilian employees may be appointed as a PA. The commanderwill issue the appointment letter (refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 020604B). The letter will con-tain the name, rank/grade, SSN, duty station of the agent, where the agent’s office will be located, theDisbursing Station Symbol Number (DSSN) of the accountable DO/DDO/DA, a description of dutiesand type payments that will be made, maximum funds to be advanced, the duration of the appoint-ment, the effective date of appointment, and a statement that the individual has been counseled onpecuniary liability and has been given written operating instructions. The agent acknowledges receiptof the appointment letter by signed the statement “I acknowledge that I am strictly liable to the UnitedStates for all public funds under my control”. 1.3. Written Operating Instructions. We suggest you use this pamphlet as part of your written instruc-tions. Additional instructions should be included with an appointment letter. 1.3.1. Agent Turn-Ins. The agent’s operating instructions should state how often the agent is requiredto make a return to the DO. While returns must be made at least monthly (DoDFMR, Vol. 5, paragraph030401D), agents who provide check cashing services should consider making turn-ins on a more fre-AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 20017quent (e.g., weekly) basis. Frequent turn-ins allow the DO/DDO to quickly deposit checks or othernegotiable instruments cashed by the agent and reduces the “float time” and number of checksreturned/dishonored for insufficient funds. 8AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 2001Chapter 2 PRIOR TO DEPARTURE 2.1. Initial Set-Up. Prior to deployment, the “supporting” MAJCOM and Base Level DA/PA shouldattempt to find out as much information as possible about the deployment. Attachment 2 contains achecklist that will aid in identifying needed information to ensure members are fully prepared prior todeparture. Attachment 3 contains a checklist for “supported” MAJCOMs to use as a guide to ensure theyare adequately prepared to answer the questions from the “supporting” MAJCOM and Base Level DA/PAs. Also included herewith are “mini-logistics detail support (LOGDET)” list of pubs, supplies, andforms. These can be found at Attachment 20, Attachment 21, and Attachment 22. In all instances, youshould work closely with your MAJCOM war planner. 2.1.1. “Bare Base” Deployments. When deploying to a new area, certain additional questions need tobe asked. These include: 2.1.1.1. Is there an U.S. Treasury approved bank? 2.1.1.2. Is there a place to store funds? 2.1.1.3. Does the local economy accept credit cards or cash? If cash, do they accept local or U.S.currencies? 2.1.1.4. Are there currency restrictions (denomination, etc.)? 2.1.1.5. Is a weapon authorized at the deployed location? If a weapon is not authorized, whatother security is available? The MAJCOM war planner should develop most of this information. You should work closelywith this individual to ensure that you have all pertinent information. If the MAJCOM war planneris not available, you should contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate that represents the AOR forthis information. Embassy phone numbers can be found in the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG).An electronic version is available at http://www.fcg.pentagon.mil. 2.1.2. Transportation. If the LOGDET is tasked and time allows, it must be transported to an AirMobility Command (AMC) Aerial Point of Debarkation (APOD) in the most economical way possi-ble that will still accomplish the mission in the time available. Contact AMC for more informationregarding aircraft into the theater. Based on the information obtained, it may be possible to use anothercommand’s LOGDET. Due to security issues, you should avoid carrying excessive cash on commer-cial transportation. 2.2. Automated Battlefield System (ABS).  2.2.1. Description. The Automated Battlefield System (ABS) was developed to meet the rapidlychanging requirements Financial Managers must face in a deployed environment. ABS uses commer-cial-off-the-shelf hardware/software and a variety of communication modes/protocols. ABS providesthe deployed Financial Manager the capability to accomplish on-line military pay inquiry support toArmy, Navy, Marine and Air Force active duty personnel as well as Air Force Reserves. ABS alsoallows you to process commitment and obligation transactions on-line to the Base Level GeneralAccounting and Finance System. Now you can provide real-time financial support to the deployedforces. AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 200192.2.2. SAF/FM Direction. As outlined in the 1998 Mid-Range plan under Support Contingency Oper-ations, ABS is deployed as standard equipment in every contingency deployment. Its use confirmsbetter customer service with fewer people required at the contingency location. Ensure eachUTC-tasked base has an ABS system in their logistics detail (LOGDET) kit. 2.2.3. Available Information. Located on the HQ Air Combat Command Financial Management webpage (https://wwwmil.acc.af.mil/fm/fmf/fmfos/abs/abs/htm) is all of the necessary informationrelating to ABS. You can access software applications, operating instructions, and links to applicableInternet sites using your web browser. The Air Force also has a technical help desk to resolve anyissues involving ABS positioned at HQ Air Combat Command Financial Management. 2.2.4. Pre-Deployment Responsibilities. Prior to the notification of a deployment, a copy of the ABSOperating Instructions should be downloaded from the HQ ACC web page. This OI should be incor-porated into the local training program to assist in preparing agents for deployment. Each individualshould have the opportunity to use the OI to accomplish the tasks outlined on an actual ABS unit. Aremote access service (RAS) account should be established at each permanent duty location. The RASis designed for dial-in connectivity and should be used for both training and actual deployments whenthere is no communications support. 2.2.4.1. Once notified of a deployment, the agent must obtain user IDs and passwords for both theAir Force and Army military pay systems from the security manager in military pay. Also, theagent must obtain terminal IDs, user IDs, and passwords for accessing the BQ system from theapplicable Accounting Liaison Office (ALO). Finally, the applicable ALO must provide informa-tion on the funding status and an Address Directory for processing commitments and obligations. 2.2.4.2. Upon notification of deployment, the agent should contact the home station or MAJCOMplanners as appropriate and attempt to determine what communications support will be availableat the deployed location. The agent also ensures that his/her communications requirements for theABS have been identified. 2.2.5. Areas of Interest while Deployed. Upon arrival at the deployed location, the agent verifies whatcommunications support is available. If there is a communication representative, that individualadvises the agent if a deployed local area network (LAN) is/will be functional. The communicationsrepresentative will also provide the information necessary to access the LAN and any technical assis-tance required. If the LAN is not yet active or will not be activated, the agent will then locate a com-mercial telephone. If austere conditions exist at the deployed site, and commercial telephones are notavailable, then the agent is authorized to take the necessary steps (e.g., purchase cell phone or othersatellite wireless communications) to establish connectivity via the RAS account. Once connectivityis established, the agent will begin daily processing into BQ, have the capability to extract reports(Paper View, WinBAS 95 or Louis Link) and process inquiries into the Defense Joint Military PaySystem (DJMS) for Air Force and Army personnel. 10AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 2001Chapter 3 WHAT TO DO AT THE DEPLOYED LOCATION 3.1.

Discussion Topics.  3.4.1. Deployed Commander. Establish office location, hours of operation, and business day hours.The DA should advise the commander on partial payments (approved authority, if any), check cashing(limits), and foreign currency sales policies. Determine if you have additional duties assigned. If thereis a conflict between your agent duties and your additional duties, discuss this with the commander. 3.4.2.

Find out if theywill accept wire transfers and EFTs, their cashier hours, how much advance notice is required toobtain U.S. or foreign currency; if they can give you a U.S. dollar check for unused U.S. currency; andif they can buy back unused foreign currency (bills and coins or bills only). Determine if they canmake vendor payments for you, current exchange rates and how often rates change. Lastly, determineif there are fees for check cashing, wire transfers, EFTs, purchasing foreign currency, exchanging for-eign currency for U.S. currency, or for making vendor payments. 3.4.4. Coordinate with transportation on the availability of a vehicle. 3.5. Informing. Inform your accountable DO/DDO, at least weekly, of your: 3.5.1.

DD Form 2666, AF Form 616, and SF 1149 (if an LDA was used). AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 200113Chapter 4 FUNDS SECURITY INFORMATION 4.1. Work Area. Signs must be posted within your cashier and office area stating “AUTHORIZED PER-SONNEL ONLY” as specified in DoDFMR Volume 5, paragraph 030302B4. 4.2. Safes. Make sure your safe is accessible to only you. Safeguard your funds in accordance with AFI31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, Chapter 25, Protecting Funds and DoDFMR Vol. 5,paragraph 030302B1 through 18. You must change the combination upon: relief, transfer, or discharge ofanyone knowing the combination; appointment of a new cashier or agent; installation of new vault or safe;at least every six months; or other times as circumstances warrant. If it is impractical to comply with theabove references, a one-drawer safe may be used, per Defense Cash Management Office (DCMO). 4.2.1. For ease of operations, prepare your SF 700, Security Container Information, and SF 702,Security Container Check Sheet at home station, but do not set your combinations until you arrive atthe deployed site. Have your accountable DO/DDO store your SF 700, in their safe. If somethingshould happen to you at the deployed site, your accountable DO/DDO can provide your alternate thesafe combination. This is not a regulatory requirement, however it could prove useful in an emer-gency. If these actions are not completed prior to departure, the deployed commander or securityofficer can store your combination (DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 030302B13). 4.2.2. The amount of currency/negotiable instruments you need to store will determine what type ofsafe you use. Generally, the safe must meet General Services Administration (GSA) specifications orbe certified as an “Underwriter’s Listed device”. If it weighs less than 500 pounds, secure it to preventit from being easily removed. If space permits, weights can also be added inside the safe to reach the500-pound requirement (refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraphs 030304 and 030305). 4.2.3. You must store cash (U.S. and foreign); uncashed prepositioned Treasury checks; cashedchecks; accountability records; and original payment and collection vouchers in the safe. Do not storeclassified material with funds (this may be waived by the deployed commander in an emergency) orput anyone’s personal funds in the safe. 4.3. Safety Deposit Box Rental. Rent a safety deposit box when no other safeguarding means are avail-able. Before renting a safety deposit box, get approval from your accountable DO/DDO. In addition, youmust contact the security forces to ensure security requirements are met; read the rental agreement care-fully to ensure the contents of the box cannot be impounded by the host government; and make sure youmaintain possession of the key at all times. The Contingency Contracting Officer (CCO) can pay for therental with the IMPAC card, or charge your AF Form 616, by using a SF 1034 to pay for the rentalcharges. 4.4. Safeguarding Funds in Hotel Safes. There may be times when other security methods are notavailable and your only option is to store funds in a hotel safe. Coordinate security requirements with thesecurity forces and find out hours of access, limitations, and restrictions. Get a signed receipt each timeyour storage container is locked in the safe. Normally, a hotel manager does not need to know the contentsof a locked container; however, it is possible you may to list the contents or place a value on them. Lastly,find out if there are any charges for using the hotel safe. Again, the CCO can pay for the rental with theIMPAC card, or charge your AF Form 616 by using a SF 1034 for payment. 14AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 20014.5. Funds Escort Procedures. (Ref AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, Chapter25, Protecting Funds). Escorts may be armed or unarmed, depending on local conditions and laws. TheChief, Security Forces, should establish the escort dollar limits. The final determination is based on theamount being transported, threat, geographic location, distance, and route. Generally, an amount up to$7,500 does not require a security forces escort. When funds are escorted regularly, vary the route andtime of movement. Escorts must not help carry the funds containers. During security forces escort, radiocontact must be maintained with the Law Enforcement Desk. Escorts must call the security forces imme-diately before their departure, giving time and place of departure, route of travel, destination, and esti-mated time of arrival. Security forces must also be notified when the escorts reach their destination.Movement of funds off base should be closely coordinated with the civil police. 4.6. Protection of Funds under Field Conditions. Under no circumstances will government funds beleft unprotected. Deploy with the minimum amount of funds necessary and make frequent deposits to reararea storage facilities (banks, finance offices, vaults, etc.). Deployed commanders will determine securityrequirements. Wherever possible, the guidelines in DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 030304 will be followed.However, where this is not practicable, MAJCOM commanders will establish procedures and guidelinesfor their Commands. AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 200115Chapter 5 EMERGENCY OPERATIONS 5.1. Robbery. The security forces should periodically schedule anti-robbery exercises. This will test boththe security forces response time and your reaction. Whether an exercise or an actual robbery, you shouldcomply with the robber’s request and try to give the robber marked bills. 5.1.1. After the robber has left the area, notify your fellow co-workers. They should secure the cash-ier area and all entrances, allowing no one to enter or exit (except security forces personnel). Segre-gate witnesses for later questioning and try to observe the direction the robber fled. 5.1.2. Activate the duress alarm (if available) and contact the security forces. Do not break contact(phone, walkie-talkie, etc.) until they tell you. In addition, complete an AF Form 439, Robbery Check-list. 5.2. Agent Killed/Injured. In most instances this should not disrupt operations. The deputy DA canobtain the safe combination from either the deployed commander or accountable DO/DDO. After the safeverification requirements are completed, business is back to normal. If there is no deputy DA/PA, contactthe accountable DO/DDO immediately. 5.3. (DA only). Limited Operations. (Ref AFI 10-213, Comptroller Operations under Emergency Con-ditions). When emergency conditions exist and there are overriding mission priorities, manpower short-falls or imminent danger to life and property, normal operations may be suspended and the agent mayassume limited operations. The deployed commander will make the decision to assume limited opera-tions. You will not take it upon yourself to stop normal operations unless you are cut off and the situationhas reached a point that clearly dictates you act immediately. 5.3.1. Heavy emphasis will be placed on safeguarding resources. Once the order is given to limitoperations, forward excess currency to your accountable DO/DDO. Generally, excess currency con-sists of coins and small bills. However, ensure you maintain sufficient currency for mission require-ments. Also, forward original disbursement and collection vouchers to your accountable DO/DDOusing a DD Form 2666, Transmittal of Statements and Vouchers, and DD Form 1081, Statement ofAgent Officer’s Account. Retain one copy of each. Throughout the limited operations, forward vouch-ers daily to your accountable DO/DDO. Ensure you use registered (uninsured) mail. 5.4. (DA only). Outside Agency Cash Turn-Ins. If conditions require an emergency turn-in of fundsfrom on-site activities, the commander or designee will instruct custodians of non-appropriated funds,Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), and custodians of appropriated funds to transfer cur-rency and coin to you. 5.4.1. Ensure you maintain a current recall listing of all cash holding activities. In addition, provideeach fund custodian training so they know what to do if a cash recall occurs. Providing them theappropriate forms in advance will speed up the cash recall process. If time is extremely limited, pro-cess the turn-in on a DD Form 634, Receipt for Miscellaneous Collections. 5.4.2. For Military Banking Facilities (MBFs), appropriated and non-appropriated fund activityturn-ins (i.e., Clubs, AAFES), process a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, using suspenseaccount 57X6875, Suspense, Department of the Air Force for all U.S. cash turn-ins (DoDFMR Vol. 5,16AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 2001paragraph 180202A, 180203A, and 180204A). Detailed instructions can be found in referenced para-graphs. 5.4.3. For MBFs, non-appropriated and appropriated foreign currency turn-ins, issue a DD Form 634only. The receipt must state: “Neither the DO, DA, nor the U.S. Government will be held accountableshould the currency/coin be lost.” (DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 180202B, 180203B, and 180204B).Detailed instructions can be found in referenced paragraphs. 5.5. Destruction of Funds. (Ref DoDFMR Vol. 5, Chapter 18 and AFI 10-213, Comptroller Operationsunder Emergency Conditions, paragraph 4.3). Currency, coin, and other negotiable instruments (blankchecks, traveler’s checks, etc.) must be completely destroyed. Ensure you have a means to rapidly inven-tory and destroy these items. Destroy the highest value items first. Destroy in the order of precedenceestablished in DODFMR, Vol. 5, paragraph 180102. 5.5.1. There are several methods of destruction available. The preferred methods are: a sodium nitrateemergency destruction kit (M4 kit), a paper shredder, or an incendiary device. If burning is used, allpaper items must be burned beyond recognition. Coins must be scattered in deep water, secretly bur-ied, or as an alternative, coins may be fused or mutilated in such a manner to make them unrecogniz-able as U.S. or foreign coins. You must make every effort to prevent currency/coins from falling intothe wrong hands. 5.5.2. If time permits, prepare a DD Form 2669, Destruction Schedule for Currency. Prepare separatecertificates, in original and three copies, for U.S. currency, U.S. coin, foreign currency, foreign coins,and Military Payment Certificates (MPC). You will have to modify block 4 of the form for U.S. coins,foreign currency bills and coins, and MPCs. Do not convert foreign currency to its U.S. dollar equiv-alent. Your other supporting documentation will reflect the U.S. dollar value. 5.5.2.1. U.S./Foreign currencies, and MPC certificates must be signed by the DA and three disin-terested officers, at least one of who is senior in rank to you. However, the arrival of a senior per-son must not unnecessarily delay destruction. If a senior person is not available, any disinterestedofficer, regardless of grade, may witness the destruction. Refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph180201A. 5.5.2.2. For U.S. and foreign coins, the destruction certificate must be signed by you and wit-nessed by two disinterested officers or two senior NCOs (E-7 or above) or any combination of theabove. The SNCOs do not have to be senior in rank to you. In addition, have the witnesses anno-tate their SSN in block 8 and provide all witnesses a copy of Attachment 17. Refer to DoDFMRVol. 5, paragraph 180201B. 5.5.2.3. For U.S. and foreign currency, send the original and two copies of the certificate alongwith copies of your DD Form 2665, Daily Agent Accountability Summary, and DD Form 2663,Foreign Currency Control Record, to DFAS-ADC/DE and your accountable DO/DDO. For MPCssend the original and two copies to the designated U.S. Army finance office and a copy toDFAS-ADC/DE along with a copy to your accountable DO/DDO. Ensure you retain a copy of allcertificates. 5.5.3. Necessary documentation for getting Treasury relief is: 5.5.3.1. The destruction certificates. AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 2001175.5.3.2. Current DD Form 2665. If time permits, the regular daily business will be ended and afinal DD Form 2665 prepared. If time does not permit, the cashier will prepare an OF Form 1129,Cashier Reimbursement Voucher and/or Accountability Report, which will be attached to the priorday’s DD Form 2665. 5.5.3.3. Form 2663, Foreign Currency Control Record, to support foreign currency certificates. 5.6. Inadvertent Wartime/Peacetime Destruction of Currency. Fragments must be inventoried by atleast three disinterested people and safeguarded the same as cash. 5.6.1. Packaging Currency.

(Ref DoDFMR Vol. 5, Chapters 4 and 12). Accommodation trans-actions are provided when satisfactory banking facilities do not exist. Accommodation transactionsinclude: regular accommodation exchanges (U.S. dollars exchanged for foreign currency); reverseaccommodation exchanges (foreign currency exchanged for U.S. dollars); and accommodation checkcashing (checks, money orders, etc., exchanged for U.S. dollars). The deployed site commander, in writ-ing, will authorize the DA to conduct these services. Adequate controls must be established to preventviolation of local restrictions. Anyone conducting these transactions must have proper identification. Reg-ular and reverse accommodation exchanges will be discussed under foreign currency operations. 6.2. Authorized Personnel. Accommodation transactions may be provided to the following individuals:active duty U.S. military members; civilian employees of the U.S. Government who are U.S. citizens; andU.S. civilians employed by U.S. firms working in the deployed area. For additional information, refer toDoDFMR Vol. 5., paragraph 040103 and 040104. 6.3. Accommodation Check Cashing. Check cashing services involve exchanging U.S. dollars forchecks, money orders, traveler’s checks, etc. The DA will coordinate with the deployment commanderand state, in writing, personal check cashing amount limitations. 6.3.1. The agent may negotiate the following instruments: personal checks and drafts, U.S. Treasurychecks, bank certified or cashier checks, money orders (postal, telephone, bank, express), traveler’schecks, and MPCs (if authorized in country). The above items must be drawn by the person presentingit. Under no circumstances will you negotiate an altered check. You may negotiate other instrumentsincluding third party instruments only when your operating instructions specifically authorize you todo so. 6.3.2. All authorized military and appropriated fund civilian personnel who request check cashingprivileges must consent, in writing, to immediate collection against their pay for the total of any dis-honored checks. Refer to the DoDFMR, Vol. 5, paragraph 040201E for procedures and options. TheTreasury FMS Form 2762 can be used for this purpose. 6.3.3. Ensure you maintain a detail record of all instruments you negotiate. You may photocopy/microfilm (both sides) of the instrument or maintain a manual log. If you maintain a manual log, it isbest to list each instrument as it is received. Ensure each cashed check has the following informationannotated: Name and SSN of the person cashing the item, military organization, duty address, andduty phone (refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraphs 050208 and 040105E). 6.4. Dishonored Checks. The accountable DO/DDO will return any bad checks that you negotiated asan advance using DD Form 1081. Upon receipt of the DD Form 1081, contact the command section todetermine if the individual is still on site. If so, make collection in cash or by cashier’s check, traveler’schecks, or U.S. Postal money order. Do not allow the individual to redeem a bad check with another per-sonal check. Also, do not allow the individual to negotiate additional checks until the bad check(s) hasbeen fully redeemed. If the individual opts to redeem a bad check(s) by payroll deduction, do not allowthe individual to negotiate additional checks until you have verified that a payroll deduction in the fullAFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 200119amount of the bad check(s) has successfully processed against the individual’s pay. If they have departed,return the dishonored check to your accountable DO/DDO as a turn in. 6.5. Foreign Currency Operations. The Treasury Department requires foreign currency be purchasedfrom a government source, if available, and at the best rate possible. MBFs are more convenient, but thebest rate rule still applies. Follow this prioritized list when getting foreign currency: 6.5.1. U.S. Treasury sources. 6.5.2. MBF. 6.5.3. Another DoD disbursing officer. 6.5.4. U.S. Embassy DO. 6.5.5. Non-appropriated fund activity. 6.5.6. Local source authorized by the local country to engage in foreign exchange transactions. 6.5.7. Foreign currency may be used to make payments to vendors and accommodation exchangesales to authorized personnel. 6.5.8. Maintain a certificate of purchase for all purchases regardless of the source. (Currently,DFAS-DE suggests you use an OF 1017-G, Journal Voucher, see Attachment 15). 6.5.9. A separate DD Form 2663, Foreign Currency Control Record, must be maintained for eachtype foreign currency purchased. It is required you maintain a separate record for vendor paymentsand accommodation exchanges if the foreign currency is being carried at two different exchange rates.The reason for this will be further explained in paragraph 6.6. below. 6.5.10. Do not acquire foreign currency prior to the time it is needed and attempt to avoid paymentfor the foreign currency until you receive it. If you must pay up-front, ensure you establish aFunds-In-Transit on your DD Form 2665, Daily Agent Accountability Summary. 6.5.11. Some countries limit the amount of currency you can purchase at any given time from U.S.Government sources or local banks. U.S. Government sources or local banks can identify these limitsfor you. If this occurs, you may have to place limits on the amounts of foreign currency individualscan purchase. Be sure to keep enough foreign currency on hand to support operational contracting andto meet official business. 6.6. Exchange Rates. This area may at first appear complicated, but it is relatively straightforward. Thesituation is governed by whether or not the country you are deployed to has a MBF, and if so, is the MBFat a location at which you receive your foreign currency. If you are purchasing your foreign currency fromthe MBF, you will usually need to have two pots of money; one pot to perform accommodationexchanges/sales, the other to make official purchases. In this situation, you must keep the funds separated.Vendor payments will be made at the official rate, and accommodation exchanges/sales will be made atthe same rate the MBF performs these transactions. If there is an in-country MBF that is not accessible toyou, or there is no in-country MBF at all, ALL transactions will be performed at the “Average PurchaseRate” of your foreign currency. (DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 130402). 6.7. Revaluation of Foreign Currency and Gains/Losses. If you are deployed to a location with aMBF, and you are procuring your foreign currency from the MBF, currency (both on-hand and in a LDA)20AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 2001must be revalued when the exchange rate changes (see paragraph 6.7.1.). If you are deployed to a locationwith an in-country MBF that is not accessible to you, or there is no in-country MBF at all, your local cur-rency remains at the rate it was purchased at. When you purchase additional foreign currency, the remain-ing currency is “averaged” with the new purchase. This will determine the new exchange rate (seeparagraph 6.7.3.). Every effort should be made to revalue/average foreign currency at the beginning of thebusiness day. This prevents the necessity of recording a gain or loss on each individual foreign currencydisbursement/collection conducted before the new rate is established. 6.7.1. When computing the new value of foreign currency on-hand, divide the balance of foreign cur-rency by the new exchange rate. Example: At close of business yesterday you had 42,380 lira on handat 630 to $1, or a value of $62.269 (3 decimal points) or $62.27. Upon starting business today, you dis-cover that the MBF rate has changed to 628 to $1. That same 42,380 lira, at today’s rate of 628 isworth $67.48. There was an increase in the value of the currency you are holding on-hand (you woulddo the exact same procedure for foreign currency held in a LDA account). This increase can be han-dled in two ways, either prepare a DD Form 1131 and collect the $.41 into the 576763 account ontoday’s business, or annotate it on line 6 of the DD Form 2665 and collect it in when you perform aturn-in. If there had been a net decrease in the value of your foreign currency, there are two ways thatthe loss can be accounted for, i.e., a SF Form 1034 on today’s business, or by recording on line 11 ofthe DD Form 2665, which you will absorb by preparing a voucher when you do a turn-in. Recordrevaluation gains/losses on DD Form 2663. 6.7.2. Post both the revaluation gain/loss and the rounding gain/loss amount to the DD Form 2665,and the DD Form 2663. The gain or loss must be documented on either DD 1131 or SF 1034 to theappropriation Gains & Deficiencies on Exchange Transactions **6763, with a Certificate of Revalua-tion (refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 130401B and C). 6.7.3. When computing the “average purchase rate” of foreign currency on –hand and in the LDA,use the following computation method: 56,565 lira on-hand at 630 is worth $89.79, 32444 lira in theLDA account at 630 is worth $51.50, total lira 89,009 worth $141.29. Now, purchase $100 worth oflira with an U.S. Treasury Check. The exchange rate today is 626. The $100 check nets an additional62,600 lira. To determine the “average exchange rate”, take the total lira (151,609) divided by the U.S.dollar value ($89.79+$51.50+$100.00) equals 628.32690 (5 decimal places per IC 97-10 to DoDFMRVol. 5). There is no accommodation gain or loss or revaluation gain or loss. Remember, only revalueyour currency when you procure additional currency. The official exchange rate is 628.32690 and willremain at that rate until you purchase additional foreign currency, even if the rate changes at the bank. 6.7.4. Record the additional purchase of foreign currency on your DD Form 2663 as well as the newexchange rate value of your on-hand and LDA account balances. Complete a “Certificate of AveragePurchase Rate” and attach to daily DD Form 2665. 6.8. Regular Accommodation Exchanges. In this type transaction, you are selling foreign currency toauthorized individuals. Your customers will exchange either U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar instruments forlocal foreign currency. All sales will be accomplished at the daily accommodation rate. 6.8.1. All sales will be posted to the DD Form 2664, Currency Exchange Record. As a minimum, usea separate DD Form 2664, for each type foreign currency sold and for each separate business day. Inaddition, cashiers must maintain their own DD Form 2664. AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 2001216.9. Reverse Accommodation Exchanges. Authority to make reverse accommodation exchanges isdetermined by whether or not there is an in-country MBF under DoD contract. If there is an in-countryMBF accessible to the deployed contingent, you may not make reverse exchanges, nor can you makereverse exchanges for members permanently assigned to the deployed country. If there is no in-countryMBF, make the reverse exchanges at the daily accommodation rate. You may refuse to conduct a reverseexchange if there is reason to believe the requester is attempting to convert illegally acquired foreign cur-rency through multiple reverse exchanges. Contact Security Forces or the Office of Special Investiga-tions. Reverse accommodation exchanges may be limited to bills only (no coins accepted). 6.9.1. All purchases will be posted to the DD Form 2664 clearly labeled “Reverse Conversions”. Likeregular accommodation exchanges, use a separate DD Form 2664 for each type foreign currency andfor each separate business day. In addition, each cashier must maintain his or her own DD Form 2664. 6.10. Rounding Gains/Losses. At the conclusion of the day, cashiers will total their DD Form 2664s.Total both the U.S. dollar and foreign currency sales columns. Next divide the foreign currency column bythe accommodation exchange rate and compare this U.S. dollar amount to the total of the U.S. dollar col-umn. It is usually at this point you will notice a rounding gain/loss. 6.11. Combined Quarterly Report of Foreign Currency. Quarterly, the DO will report the DA’s for-eign currency activities to DFAS-DE. You may be called upon to provide supporting information to theDO for his report. 6.12. (DA Only). Limited Depository (LD). (Refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, Chapter 14). There may be sit-uations when you have difficulty obtaining foreign currency or vendor payments are too large for cashpayments. If this occurs, you may have to establish a limited depository account. 6.12.1. Explanation of Terms: 6.12.1.1. Limited Depository (LD): A U.S. or foreign commercial bank designated by the Secre-tary of the Treasury to receive deposits from DO/DDOs or DAs. The LD may also be referred toas designated depositories. 6.12.1.2. Limited Depository Account (LDA): A foreign currency account in the name of theactivity to which the DO is assigned, and maintained in a foreign bank, by a DO/DDO or DA. ALDA is DSSN specific, and therefore is always “owned” by the DO. 6.12.1.3. LD Check: A check drawn form the official checking account of the DO/DDO or DA. 6.12.1.4. Confirmed Deposit: A deposit for which a receipted deposit ticket has been receivedfrom the LD. The ticket must show the date on which the deposit was credited to the checkingaccount. 6.12.2. Disbursing agents outside the U.S. must request permission to establish a LDA. The follow-ing are steps that must be taken when requesting a LDA. (If a recent site survey has been conductedfor the deployed location, much of the banking information may already be available): 6.12.2.1. If the MBF can support the operation no further action or request is required. 6.12.2.2. If not, solicit local banks to ascertain what services are available and the cost. After con-tract MBFs, preference will be given to American financial institutions unless a local bank’sarrangements is more advantageous to the U.S. Government. A statement from the selected bank22AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 2001stating that they will provide the services must be obtained. Any bank charges must be identified.Attach results to memorandum requesting approval for the LDA. 6.12.2.3. If more than one currency is to be used this must be stated in the request. Approval bythe Treasury is given for each currency. 6.12.2.4. Approval to open a LDA will come from the U.S. Treasury, through the DefenseFinance and Accounting Service, Disbursing and Cash Management Office. 6.12.2.5. The memorandum from the DO must include:   Name and address of bank    Reason for establishing an account Point of contact and phone number at bank  Type of currency/currencies that is/are to be used. (If U.S. dollars are needed, the bankmust be collateralized)   How payments are to be made (i.e., cash, check, wire transfer)   Approximate amount of U.S. currency/foreign currency disbursements per month   Average amount of cash, if any, to be retained in the bank overnight   DSSN of the Disbursing Officer 6.12.2.6. The request, plus attachments, will be forwarded through the servicing DDO. The DDOwill forward the request through the servicing DFAS Field Site DO for endorsement, which willforward it through DFAS/DCMO to the Treasury. 6.12.3. If a site survey has been performed for the deployed site, the survey can be a useful startingpoint for gathering banking information in the area. 6.12.4. When a DA knows in advance that he or she is to be deployed, there is nothing to precludesaid DA from starting the LDA approval process before deployment. This could be especially usefulwhen a DA is replacing an existing DA serviced by a different DO. The same information used to getapproval of the existing LDA could be used to request approval for the follow-on LDA. 6.12.5. Minimum required services are ability to honor payments to payees in outlying areas, providemonthly bank statements, and accept Treasury requirement for a zero (or near zero) account balance. 6.12.6. Confirmed deposits to the LDA do not reduce your accountability. Make deposits on theforms prescribed by the bank. You must abide by local policy concerning the taking of LDA checksoutside the country. When prohibited, overprint checks with the words “NOT NEGOTIABLE OUT-SIDE OF (Specify the country)”. 6.12.7. Service fees will be charged against your AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, using a SF1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal. 6.13. (DA only). Statement of Designated Depository. At the end of each accounting month, and uponclosing the LDA account, you must send your accountable DO a signed original and duplicate of a SF1149, Statement of Designated Depository Account. Refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 140902 fordetailed instructions. AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 2001236.14. (DA only). Closing the LDA. There are several situations that could cause you to close theaccount and each has specific actions you must accomplish. Refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 1410 fordetailed instructions. 6.15. Control of Voucher Numbers. Use a DD Form 2666, Transmittal of Statements and Vouchers, tocontrol voucher numbers. This will save time in the long run. If you use a voucher log, you have the addi-tional workload of also listing the vouchers on a DD Form 2666 prior to giving them to your accountableDO. Note: Request accountable DO/DDO assign a special voucher series to each of its deployed agents;this will allow the accountable DO/DDO to recognize each agents’ vouchers. 6.15.1. Prepare a DD Form 2666 for all collections and disbursements by each PC and partial pay-ments to other branches of service. All voucher numbers must be accounted for. 6.15.2. The prefix for each PC voucher number should differ from the DO’s prefix. Example, AP –Military Pay; AT – Travel Pay; AS – Accounts Payable; etc. Voucher number prefix will be providedby the appointing FSO. 6.15.3. Each DD Form 2666 must show the: 6.15.3.1. Agent’s voucher number. 6.15.3.2. Payee’s Name. 6.15.3.3. U.S. dollar amount. 6.15.3.4. Foreign currency amount, if voucher is paid in foreign currency. 6.15.3.5. Date paid. 6.15.3.6. Contract or purchase order number, if applicable. 6.16. Military Pay Payments. The deployed commander should establish a partial payment policy. Usethe member’s Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) to compute the payment. If a LES is not available, thetable below may be used as a guide. This is only a guide. The deployed commander can establish any lim-its appropriate to the deployment. E1 – E3E4 – E6E7 – 0304 – above====$100.00 $150.00 $250.00 $500.00 6.16.1. If a member needs a payment due to non-receipt of paycheck (local payee), request messageauthority from the permanent duty station DO before making any payment. Advise the member thatany payment received will be deducted from a future payday (normally within next two pay periods). 6.16.2. Individual payments may be made using DD Form 1351-6, Multiple Payments List. 24AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 20016.17. Military Pay Payments to Other Service Active Duty Personnel (Including Guard andReserve). Please refer to DFAS-DE Manual 7073-1, Chapter 77 for guidance. 6.18. Miscellaneous Military Pay Information.  6.18.1. Confirmation of direct deposit amounts can be accomplished by using ABS to inquire theDefense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS), by phone, message, or GAO3 listing. 6.18.2. Hardship Duty Pay is payable only in certain locations. See DoDFMR 7000.14-R, Vol. 7A,Chapter 17, and IC 11-99, for a listing of locations. It is payable to enlisted personnel only and the ratevaries by grade. 6.18.3. Family Separation Allowance-Type T (FSA-Type-T). Members with dependents and mem-bers married to military members who meet the requirements outlined in the DoDFMR, Vol. 7A,Chapter 27, and message R231300Z April 98, Subject: FSA Waivers, may be entitled to FSA-Type-Tat the rates prescribed in paragraph 270104B or D, as applicable. Procedures for starting FSA-Type-Tupon commencement of a TDY expected to exceed 30 days duration are contained in DFAS-DEM7073-1, paragraph 27-6. 6.18.4. Imminent Danger/Hostile Fire Pay applies to only those locations listed in DoDFMR7000.14-R, Vol. 7A, Chapter 10, including all Interim Message Changes (IMCs). It is payable to allranks and members need to be in the area for one day in order to receive the entitlement for the month. 6.18.5. FY98 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Section 602, Reform of BAS changedthe definition of field duty (this definition is used only in determining BAS entitlement, not per diemRef 6.23) which, in turn changed BAS deduction requirements. Only those enlisted members partici-pating in maneuvers, war games, field exercises, or similar type operations in excess of 180 days willforfeit their BAS. BAS is retained for any deployment of 180 days or less. See DoDFMR 7000.14-R,Vol. 7A, Chapter 25, and IC 29-98 for additional guidance. 6.19. Travel Payments to Regular Air Force/Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve (Note: Pay-ments should be made by home PDS).  Advance per diem payments are based on the daily per diemrate times the number of TDY days. Record the payments on a DD Form 1351-1, Travel Allowance Pay-ment List, or DD Form 1351-6, Multiple Payments List. Use a DD Form 1351, Travel Voucher, as a coversheet. Immediately, after making payment, mail or fax a copy of each payment to the member’s servicingFSO. In addition, notify their FSO by message. 6.19.1. TDY personnel claim missed meals using an AF Form 2282, Statement of Adverse Effect –Use of Government Facilities. Before departing the site, members must have the form approved by thedeployment commander. 6.20. Travel Payments to Other Service Personnel (Note: Payments should be made by home PDS).Use a DD Form 1351 for making payments. For Navy and Marine personnel, endorse their originalorders. Unless authorized by the deployed commander, no travel advance is authorized when the esti-mated costs are less than $50. Refer to DFAS-DE 7010.3-R, Travel Transactions at Base Level, Chapter18 (Marine), 19 (Navy), and 20 (Army) for specific procedures. 6.21. Travel Payments to Allied Nation Members. Prior to making any payments, coordinate withyour accountable DO/DDO. Approval must first be obtained from DFAS-AYCFM/DE. If approval hasAFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 200125been obtained, payment will be made from your AF Form 616. Payment amounts are limited to $2,000per person. At the time of payment, a receipt must be obtained from the individual. As a minimum, thereceipt must contain: 6.21.1. Name, grade, signature, identification number, organization, and country of individual. 6.21.2. Purpose of the advance. 6.21.3. Type and amount of currency advanced. 6.21.4. Rate of exchange per one U.S. dollar of the foreign currency at the time the advance is made. 6.21.5. Equivalent amount of U.S. currency. 6.21.6. Address of the settlement officer (so a billing document with receipts and supporting docu-mentation can be sent). Submit the paid advance voucher and the above documentation to the accountable DO/DDO on a sep-arate DD Form 2666. 6.22. DD Form 1588, Record of Travel Payments. A DD Form 1588 (or comparable form) will beused to record all travel payments. Establish a record the first time an individual receives a travel advance/accrual. Entries on the form should be complete enough to use in determining additional payments,adjustments, and final settlements. 6.23. Field Conditions. The JFTR Appendix A defines field duty as “All duty by members serving withtroops participating in maneuvers, war games, field exercises, or similar types of operations, and 6.23.1. The member is subsisted in a government mess or with an organization drawing field rations,and is provided government quarters or is quartered in accommodations normally associated withfield exercises (everything normally covered by per diem is furnished without charge, except thatofficer members are required to pay for rations at the discounted meal rate (basic meal rate)), or 6.23.2. Students are participating in survival training and forage for subsistence and improvise theirown shelter..” 6.23.3. Members furnished quarters and subsistence obtained by contract may also be considered asperforming field duty when so declared by competent official. 6.23.4. The change to the definition of field duty in the DoDFMR Vol. 7 is for use in determining theentitlement to Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) and has no effect on the non-entitlement to perdiem. 6.23.5. It is the responsibility of the senior commander in charge of the deployment to declare anddetermine the period of field duty. The senior commander is also responsible for determining howtroops will be fed and billeted during the period of field duty. Although the field duty definition readsin part, “and is quartered in accommodations normally associated with field exercises,” this does notpreclude the commander from providing troops with contract quarters or billeting at no charge. Youshould brief personnel about certificates needed to support payment of per diem for any period theywere not under field conditions. This certificate must be signed by the senior commander (or desig-nee) in charge of the deployment and be in the following format: “I certify that from (date) through(date), (name/SSN) was not quartered/subsisted under field conditions.” 26AFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 20016.24. Managing an AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization. Be sure you know what can and cannotbe purchased. Payments for local goods and services may be for any number of things. Question the needfor the item and why it cannot be shipped. Some common authorized purchases are: 6.24.1. Vehicle rentals for official business. 6.24.2. Official newspaper subscriptions. 6.24.3. Machine parts, paint, signs, photographic supplies/services, etc., for mission accomplishment. 6.24.4. Billeting/accommodations. 6.24.5. Insurance on rental vehicles when not included in rental agreement (only in overseas loca-tions). 6.25. Using a SF 44, Purchase Order – Invoice Number. This form may be used to purchase itemsfrom local vendors during exercises or emergency conditions. The contracting officer should designatethe purchasing agent in writing. In addition, written instructions defining what may or may not be pur-chased should also be included. However, the contracting officer is still responsible for the purchasingagent’s actions. The SF 44 must clearly describe the service or commodity being procured (Ref AFFARSup 5301.690). Do not use a SF 44 as a payment documents, but as an attachment to a SF 1034, PublicVoucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal. The small size of the SF 44 makes certification,brief block, and other documentation requirements difficult (Ref DFAS-DE 7010-2.R, Commercial Trans-actions at Base Level, paragraph 13-1a(1)). If the purchaser and seller blocks are signed, the otherback-up documentation requirements (receiving report and invoice) remain unchanged (Ref DFAS-DE7010.2-R Chapter 14). 6.25.1. The dollar limitation on a SF 44 is $2,500 for all purchases except for aviation fuel and oilpurchases which will not exceed the small purchases limitation in FAR 13.000 ($25,000); and over-seas transactions by warranted contracting officers up to the small purchase limitation established byFAR 13.000 in support of contingencies declared by the Secretary of Defense. 6.25.2. A funded SF 44 is subject to the same guidelines and fund availability as the AF Form 616,Fund Cite Authorization. Operations and Maintenance fund cites must be clearly shown on the SF 44and the AF Form 616 and advice number must be shown in the accounting data block. 6.25.3. A stock fund funded SF 44 (i.e., diesel fuel) must meet the requisitioning criteria establishedby the Standard Base Supply System. The proper stock fund appropriation must be clearly shown onthe SF 44. 6.26. Government Purchase Card. All participants in the Government Purchase Card Program (com-monly known as IMPAC) must review the existing policy guidelines “USAF Internal Procedures forInternational Merchant Purchase Authorization Card (IMPAC)”, set forth by SAF/AQC (to be publishedas AFI 64-177). Procedures used during the contingency operation must be coordinated and approved byFM and LGC. With the exception of the information contained in this section, all other Air Force Govern-ment Purchase Card procedures apply to the use of the card for contingency operations. 6.26.1. Warranted contingency contracting officers (CCO) are authorized to used the IMPAC in con-tingencies. A certified funding document (AF Form 4009, Government Purchase Card Funding Doc-ument) is required before purchase cards are requested. Accounts can be zero funded but must beassigned a specific base fund cite and corresponding master account code. When the CCO is notifiedAFPAM65-110   10 OCTOBER 200127to deploy an updated fund cite should be provided immediately. The original funding document willbe updated with the new fund cite and dollar amount – master account code should remain the same.Adequate funding is required before using the card. The funding document shall be closely moni-tored by both the approving official and the finance representative and shall be reconciled at leastmonthly. The approving official is ultimately responsible for ensuring purchases are authorized inaccordance with Air Force policy. 6.26.2. The contracting and financial management officer must train cardholders on how to buy directfrom the local vendor market. FM must provide joint local training to provide emphasis on ethics/pro-curement integrity, fiscal responsibility, and local business environment. Use may require cardholdersto travel off base to make purchases or to meet vendors at the gate to accept deliveries. All participantsmust resolve Force Protection issues when initiating use of the card program. (Note: Unit cards cannotbe brought from “home station” as they are linked to base funding documents and that bases’ accountcannot be transferred.) 6.27. Using an AF Form 315, U.S. Air Force AV Fuels Invoice. (ref AFI 23-202, Buying PetroleumProducts, and Other Supplies and Services Off-Station, and DFAS-DE 7010.2-R, paragraph 21-46).Authorized purchases are: a. Supplies and services in direct support of aircraft, motor vehicles, and boats when support cannotbe obtained from U.S. Government sources (e.g., for emergency purchases); b.Items or services required for immediate use maintaining communications, electronics, or meteo-rological equipment (these type purchases are authorized when the deployment communicationsupport or mobile team personnel cannot get the equipment from their supply base); c. Mechanical services, storage, civilian guards, etc. that are not within a reasonable distance of yoursite; d. And civilian guards or caretakers needed to protect an aircraft accident or forced landing site. 6.27.1. For aviation fuels purchased from the host government charge the fuels Stock Fund Appropri-ation. 6.27.2. For ground fuels, liquid oxygen, oil, etc. purchased from the host government charge your AFForm 616. 6.27.3. The following personnel or their designees are authorized to make the above listed purchases: 6.27.3.1. Aircraft commander. 6.27.3.2. Motor vehicle operators and boat masters. 6.27.3.3. Air Force Material Command depot area assistance maintenance team chiefs. 6.27.3.4. Communication electronic and installation team chiefs. 6.27.3.5. Mobile communications group deployment commanders or chiefs. 6.28. Foreign Currency Payment Vouchers.
