Scope.  This  instruction  outlines  the  procedures  applicable  to  the  safe  operation  of  the aircraft.    Along  with  the  complementary  references  cited,  this  instruction  prescribes  standard operational  procedures  to  be  used  by  all  pilots  operating  the  aircraft.    Units  will  provide  local operating  procedures  in  a  supplement  to  this  publication.    (T-2).    Note:  Service  contracts  may further restrict operations. 1.2.  Pilot’s  Responsibility.  In  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives,  this  instruction prescribes procedures under most circumstances, but is not to be used as a substitute for sound judgment  or  common  sense.  The  pilot  in  command  (PIC)  is  ultimately  responsible  for  the  safe and effective operation of the aircraft  and will ensure all occupants of the aircraft comply with this directive.  (T-0). from these  procedures 1.3.  Deviations.  Deviations the MAJCOM/A3  unless  an  urgent  requirement  or  aircraft  emergency  dictates  otherwise.    In  that case,  the  PIC  has  ultimate  authority  and  responsibility  for  the  course  of  action  to  be  taken  and will  take  the  appropriate  action  to  safely  recover  the  aircraft.    Report  all  deviations  without waiver through channels to the MAJCOM OPR.  (T-0). require  specific  approval  of 1.4.  References.  The primary references for aircraft operations are this instruction and technical orders  (TO)  1T-41D-1,  Flight  Manual,  USAF  T-41D  Series  Aircraft,  TO  1T-51A-1,  Flight Manual, USAF T-51A Series Aircraft, TO 1T-53A-1, Flight Manual, USAF T-53 Series Aircraft. Training  units  may  develop  phase  manuals  from  the  procedures  contained  in  these  documents. Phase  manuals  may  be  used  to  augment  initial  and  mission  qualification  training.  They  may expand these basic procedures, but will not be less restrictive.  (T-2).  Only maneuvers described in these references will be flown.  (T-2). 1.5.  Recommended Changes and Waivers: 1.5.1.  Submit suggested improvements to this instruction on AF Form 847, Recommendation for  Change  of  Publication,  to  the  parent  MAJCOM  through  standardization/evaluation (stan/eval) channels.  (T-1).  AF Form 847 is listed as an adopted form in AFI 11-215, USAF Flight  Manuals  Program  [FMP].    Refer  to  that  publication  for  guidance  on  filling  out  the form. 1.5.2.  Policy  and procedures are enacted to  provide quality  and consistency in  training and evaluation  whether  at  an  undergraduate  or  graduate level.  Occasionally,  unique circumstances  may  warrant  special  consideration  and  possible  waiver  of  policy  provisions. At  the  same  time,  because  it  is  important  to  preserve  fidelity  of  training,  evaluation,  and policy implementation throughout the command, a process must be established for review of proposed waivers. 1.5.3.  Waivers should be submitted using AF Form 679, Air Force Publication Compliance Item  Waiver  Request/Approval  or  as  directed  in  AFI  33-360  Publications  and  Forms Management. 6 AFI11-2T-41-51-53V3  9 JUNE 2017 1.5.4.  Waivers  that  change  the  intent  of  the  policy  outlined  in  this  instruction  are  not authorized without AETC/A2/3/10 (T-2) approval.  Unless otherwise stated in this document, Wing/CCs (T-3) are the approval authority for individual personnel exceptions to the policy outlined in this instruction caused by special or unusual circumstances. 1.5.5.  AETC Units. Coordinate T-2 waivers through AETC/A3VO as appropriate. Squadron commanders  will  submit  all  T-2  waiver  requests  through  command  channels  in  electronic format  using  AF  Form  679,  Air  Force  Publication  Compliance Item  Waiver Request/Approval.  (T-2).  Waiver requests must provide justification why the individual or unit  cannot  comply  with  requirements.

Preflight: 3.1.1.  Aircraft  Systems.  Students  will  not  fly  solo  in  aircraft  requiring  an  operational check.  (T-2).  Pilots may perform operational checks during dual student training sorties if the checks do not interfere with training objectives. 3.1.2.  Foreign  Object  Damage  (FOD).  To  reduce  the  risk  of  FOD  and  personal  injury, personnel will ensure loose items are secured in the cockpit at all times.  (T-2). 3.1.3.  Preflight Inspections: 3.1.3.1.  If  the  issued  survival  kit  is  missing  or  its  inspection  is  overdue,  contact  the Aircrew Flight Equipment. 3.1.3.2.  Visually  check  fuel  quantity  prior  to  every  flight.  Check  fuel  samples  for impurities and proper type after every refueling and before the first flight of the day.  To obtain the most valid sample, fuel should be allowed to settle for 30 minutes to an hour after refueling.  If the sample is good, pour back into tank or follow local procedures for sump  fuel.  If  the  sample  is  bad,  immediately  contact  local  refueling  and  maintenance personnel. 3.1.3.3.  Pilots  will not hand-prop  the  aircraft.  (T-2).   If the pilot  confirms  the master and ignition switches are off with the ignition key removed, the propeller may be turned to facilitate ground handling or to loosen congealed oil prior to cold starts. This does not constitute hand-propping. 3.1.3.4.  If the aircraft requires the use of external power to start the engine for the first sortie  of  the  day,  personnel  will  notify  maintenance  and  make  an  entry  in  the  AFTO Form781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and  Work  Document.    (T-3).    Only  maintenance personnel  will connect  and disconnect  the external  power source.   (T-2).    If the  aircraft requires the use of external power to start on any subsequent flight with the engine warm, abort the aircraft and make an entry in the AFTO Form 781A.  (T-2). 3.1.3.5.  Aircraft remaining off-station overnight  will carry chocks, tie-downs, and extra engine oil.  (T-3). 3.2.  Ground and Taxi Operations: 3.2.1.  Refueling  Operations.  Personnel  not  actively  involved  in  refueling  will  remain  at least 50 feet away from an aircraft refueling operation.  (T-2).  In addition, do not operate the engine, taxi, or radiate electromagnetic energy (radio, distance measuring equipment [DME], cell phones, or transponder operation) within the 50 feet safety zone. 3.2.2.  Ground Handling: 3.2.2.1.  Pilots will ground handle the aircraft whenever minimum wingtip clearances will be compromised during taxi.  (T-2). 10 AFI11-2T-41-51-53V3  9 JUNE 2017 3.2.2.2.  A qualified pilot or maintenance personnel must supervise ground handling.  (T-2).    Note:    Personnel  will  use  extreme  caution  when  ground  handling  aircraft.    (T-2).  Improper ground handling may result in structural damage. 3.2.2.3.  Do not use the empennage (tail section) to ground handle or turn the T-41 or T-51 or T-53.  (T-2). 3.2.3.  Prior to Starting Engine: 3.2.3.1.  At home station, pilots will ensure a fire bottle is in the vicinity prior to engine start.  (T-2). 3.2.3.2.  When starting behind another aircraft, pilots will ensure a minimum of  25 feet nose-to-tail separation.  (T-2). 3.2.4.  Engine Start: 3.2.4.1.  A qualified pilot or maintenance personnel will perform all engine starts.  (T-2).  Exception: Student pilots may start the engine under the supervision of an IP. 3.2.4.2.  If the engine fails after warmup for no apparent reason, abort the aircraft. Enter all engine failures or abnormalities on the AFTO Form 781A to include the total time the engine ran.  (T-2). 3.2.5.  After Engine Start.  Pilots will: 3.2.5.1.  Not onload or offload personnel or equipment while the engine is running.  (T-2). 3.2.5.2.  Use  caution  to  avoid  upsets  due  to  strong  jet  or  propeller  blast  from  larger aircraft.  If  aircraft  control  is  lost  during  taxi,  the  pilot  will  immediately  shut  down  the engine.  (T-2). 3.2.5.3.  Avoid  taxiing  through  snowdrifts  and  significant  accumulations  of  ice.    (T-2).  To  avoid  damage  to  the  propeller,  pilots  will  plan  to  taxi  around  gravel  and  puddles  of water  and  avoid  high  power  settings  on  the  ground  (greater  than  1500  RPM)  when possible.    (T-2).    When  damage  to  the  prop  tips  is  likely,  pilots  will  maintain  full  aft elevator control unless wind conditions dictate otherwise.  (T-2). 3.2.5.4.  Avoid rolling over any  cables or arresting  gear during taxi,  takeoff, or landing.  (T-2). 3.2.6.  Minimum Spacing and Taxi Interval.  Comply with the minimum taxi clearances in AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground. In addition, maintain: 3.2.6.1.  At least 50 feet behind light single-engine aircraft.  (T-2). 3.2.6.2.  At least 100 feet behind multi-engine or jet aircraft.  (T-2). 3.2.6.3.  A minimum of 500 feet behind taxiing helicopters.  (T-2). 3.2.7.  Wind  Limitations.  When  the  wind  equals  or  exceeds  gusts  of  35  knots,  pilots  will turn  the  aircraft  into  the  wind  and  cease  all  taxi  operations.    (T-2).    If  a  tow  is  required, shutdown the engine, set the parking brake, and wait for the tow to arrive.  (T-2). AFI11-2T-41-51-53V3  9 JUNE 2017 11 3.2.8.  Engine  Run-up.  Do  not  perform  an  engine  run-up  while  an  aircraft  is  stopped  or taxiing within a 100 ft of the front  of  your aircraft.  (T-2).  Do not  taxi within 100ft of the front of another aircraft performing an engine run-up.  (T-2). 3.3.  Takeoff and Landing: 3.3.1.  Runway: 3.3.1.1.  All  takeoffs  and  landings  require  prepared  surface  runways.  The  minimum runway required for normal operations is 2,485 by 40 feet or the sum of the takeoff and landing  rolls,  whichever  is  greater.    T-53  aircrews  will  compare  the  sum  of  the  takeoff and landing roll to the accelerate-stop distance and use the greater of the two values.  (T-2). 3.3.1.1.1.  Do  not  take  any  headwind  component  into  account  when  computing takeoff  and  landing  distances.    (T-2).
