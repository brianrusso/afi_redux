Purpose.  The  AF  Strategic  Basing  Process  provides  an  enterprise-wide  transparent, defendable,  and  repeatable  process  for  decision  making  to  ensure  all  strategic  basing  actions involving  AF  units  and  missions  support  AF  mission  requirements  and  comply  with  all applicable  environmental  guidance.    This  AFI  describes  the  process  for  how  mission requirements and locations are vetted and approved consistent with definitions in paragraph 1.6. 1.2.  Applicability.  AF  and  non-AF  entities  use  this  AFI  for  basing  actions  and  only  written basing  decisions  supported  by  the  processes  and  procedures  contained  herein  are  considered valid.  (T-1)  Specific exemptions to the Strategic Basing Process are listed in  chapter 16. Any questions  regarding  whether  an  action  qualifies  as  a  strategic  basing  action  are  referred  to SAF/IEIB for final determination. 1.2.1.  Overseas Basing.  Overseas basing applies to any basing action at any location outside the  United  States  or  its  territories/possessions.    Overseas  basing  actions  follow  the  process outlined  in  this  instruction  as  well  as  AFI  10-504,  Overseas  Force  Structure  Changes  and Host-Nation  Notification,  the  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  Instruction  (CJCSI) 2300.02J, Coordination of Overseas Force Structure Changes and Host-Nation Notification, and the primary AF source of guidance on environmental analysis required abroad, 32 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 989 at 989.37 and 989.38. 1.2.2.  Organization  Change  Requests  (OCR),  Program  Change  Requests  (PCR),  Program Action  Directives  (PAD),  Program  Guidance  Letters  (PGL)  or  Programming  Plans  (PPlan) do  not  constitute  basing  decision  execution  authority  nor  are  they  exempted  from  the Strategic Basing process. 1.2.3.  This instruction does not apply to: 1.2.3.1.  Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions. 1.2.3.2.  Expeditionary and contingency operations. 1.2.3.3.  Real property classified as industrial facilities under the control of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) (SAF/AQ). 1.2.3.4.  Testing  and  Evaluation  and  Depot  Source  of  Repair.    Actions  governed  by  the Testing  and  Evaluation    (T&E)  process  as  defined  in  AFI  99-103,  Capabilities-Based Test  and  Evaluation,  or the  Depot  Source  of  Repair  (DSOR)  process  as  defined  in  AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management, are exempt from the requirements of this instruction. 1.2.3.4.1.  Actions  that  exceed  the  scope  of  the  T&E  or  DSOR  processes  may  be considered AF strategic basing actions as defined in paragraph 1.7.  Coordinate with SAF/IEIB  to  determine  if  these  actions  require  approval  through  the  AF  Strategic Basing Structure.   AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 7 1.3.  Strategic Basing Alignment with Other AF and DoD Corporate Processes and Policies. 1.3.1.  Total  Force  Enterprise  (TFE).    TFE  actions  follow  AFI  90-1001,  Planning  Total Force  Associations  (TFAS),  and  are  coordinated  with  the  AF  Strategic  Basing  Process  as defined in chapter 6. 1.3.2.  Program  Objective  Memorandum.    While  strategic  basing  is  the  default  method  for making  basing  decisions,  actions  approved  by  the  Air  Force  Corporate  Structure  (AFCS) through  the  POM  process  are  coordinated  through  the  AF  Strategic  Basing  Process  as described in chapter 7. 1.3.3.  Real  Estate  Actions.    Leases  follow  applicable  AF  instructions  (AFI  32-9000-series) and  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Center  (AFCEC)  procedures  for  real  property  management.  Certain real estate actions described in chapter 16 are exempt from the AF Strategic Basing Process.  As  necessary,  the  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  Installations (SAF/IEI), may require real estate actions be coordinated with SAF/IEIB and AFCEC upon being submitted for approval. 1.3.4.  Air Reserve Component.  All strategic basing actions that affect ANG or AFR units or installations  also  require  compliance  with  Department  of  Defense  Instruction  (DODI) 1225.08, Reserve Component Facilities and Unit Stationing.   1.3.5.  Major Range and Test Facility Bases.  All strategic basing actions that affect a Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) also require compliance with DODD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base, and DODI 3200.18, Management and Operation of the Major Range and Test Facility Base. for  Acquisition,  Technology  and  Logistics 1.3.6.  Joint  Basing.    Strategic  basing  actions  at  joint  base  locations,  where  AF  is  the supporting Component, follow this instruction and the guidance and instructions in the Under Secretary  of  Defense (USD(AT&L)) Memorandum,  “Department  of  Defense  Supplemental  Guidance  for  Implementing  and Operating  a  Joint  Base  -  New  Mission  Stationing/Beddown,”  for  joint  mission  alignment.  Synchronization  of  operational  and  installation  support,  dispute  resolution,  and  transfer  of Total  Obligation  Authority  (TOA)  for  support  costs  are  addressed  in  the  Basing  Action Request (BAR), described in paragraph 3.1, of the AF Strategic Basing Process.  See chapter 10 for additional details. 1.3.7.  National Capital Region (NCR) Basing.  Any basing action, regardless of size, which takes  place  within  100  miles  of  the  Pentagon  (the  NCR)  is  subject  to  the  National  Capital Planning  Act  set  forth  at  40  U.S.C.  §§8701  et  seq.,  DODI  5305.5,  Space  Management Procedures,  National  Capital  Region,  AFI  32-9010,  Management  and  Reporting  of  Air Force  Space  and  Building  Services  in  OSD  Assigned  Facilities  and  in  the  Washington  DC Area,  and  Secretary  of  Defense  Memorandum,  “Land  Acquisition  and  Leasing  of  Office Space  in  the  United  States,”  in  addition  to  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  this instruction.    No  proposals  for  relocating  into  or  within  the  NCR  that  exceed  $500,000  in relocation  costs  may  be  made  public  without  Secretary  of  Defense  (SecDef)  or  Deputy SecDef approval.  8 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 1.4.  Environmental  Planning  and  Decision  Making.  This  instruction  does  not  provide National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) guidance, but is viewed and executed integrally with NEPA  as  implemented  within  the  Air  Force  by  32  CFR  989,  Environmental  Impact  Analysis Process  (EIAP).    Details  on  EIAP  requirements  for  strategic  basing  actions  are  identified  in paragraphs 3.2.8, 3.3.5,  3.4, and  chapter  15.   Timing of key NEPA milestones in  the strategic basing process are discussed in paragraphs 3.2.8 and 3.3.5. 1.5.  Documentation.  All taskings related to the AF Strategic Basing Process are accomplished in  writing.    See  Attachment  1,  Glossary  of  References  and  Supporting  Information,  for  terms used in this instruction. 1.6.  Definitions.  The  terms  basing  and  beddown  are  not  interchangeable.    Basing  is  a standardized,  repeatable,  transparent  and  deliberate  process  used  to  determine  the  location  of  a unit,  mission,  activity,  or  manpower.    Beddown  is  considered  the  execution  of  an  approved basing action.  Coordination between programming and basing actions is essential to successful AFCS review. 1.6.1.  Basing  Action.    A  basing  action  is  any  action  (i.e.,  activation,  inactivation, adjustment) that results in the increase, decrease, and/or movement of: 1.6.1.1.  AF or non-AF units, missions, manpower authorizations, and/or weapon systems to a location determined to be AF real property. 1.6.1.2.  AF  units,  missions,  manpower  authorizations,  and/or  weapon  systems  to  a location determined to be non-AF real property. 1.7.  AF Strategic Basing Actions. 1.7.1.  An AF strategic basing action is any basing action as defined in paragraph 1.6 meeting the criteria below. 1.7.1.1.  A  weapon  system  change  (additions,  subtractions,  or  mission  design replacement);  excludes  tail  number  swaps,  block/spiral  upgrades,  and  assignment  of Backup  Aerospace  Vehicle  Inventory  (BAI),  and/or  Attrition  Reserve  (AR)  aircraft. (Weapons  systems  are  defined  by  AFPD  10-9,  Lead  Command  Designation  and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems) 1.7.1.2.  Any organization action, as defined in AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization, that changes the number of permanent party and/or contractor personnel at an installation by at least 35.  See Attachment 1, Terms, Organization Action. 1.7.1.3.  A  unit  movement  as  described  in  AFI  16-403,  Updating  the  USAF  Program Installations, Units, and Priorities and Movement of Air Force Units. 1.7.1.4.  A non-AF entity requesting to move onto an AF installation or AF real property.  Non-AF entity exemptions are listed in paragraph 16.2. 1.7.1.5.  Any action by a non-AF entity residing on an AF installation or AF real property that  results  in  a  change  to  their  primary  mission,  to  include  any  increase  in  airspace  or range requirements/usage, or a change of 35 or more personnel.  AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 9 1.7.1.6.  An AF or non-AF entity continuous rotational presence or temporary duty on an AF installation or AF real property that will require the need for new construction or is greater than 300 days in a consecutive 18 month period with  an increase of 35 or more personnel (does not include base operating support (BOS)). 1.7.1.7.  Any  special  interest  action,  as  identified  by  SAF/IEIB,  regardless  of  size  or scope. 1.7.2.  AF strategic basing decisions are approved by the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) or delegated authority. These basing actions require staffing through the AF Strategic Basing Process as outlined in this AFI. 1.7.3.  Basing actions which do not meet the criteria above or are requested for a duration not to  exceed  one  year  are  the  responsibility  of  the  host  and/or  designated  lead  MAJCOM  and follow  appropriate  MAJCOM  processes  for  approval  and  beddown  execution,  to  include compliance with environmental laws, regulations, policy, and guidance.  Refer any questions regarding  whether  an  action  qualifies  as  a  strategic  basing  action  to  SAF/IEIB  for  final determination. 1.8.  Resource  Commitment.  Commitment  of  AF  resources,  construction,  movement  of personnel  and/or  equipment,  or  similar  actions  may  not  occur  prior  to  SecAF  (or  SecAF delegated  authority)  approval  of  an  AF  strategic  basing  action.  The  SecAF  approval  will  be documented in the form of a signed Basing Decision Memorandum (BDM) when EIAP results in a Categorical Exclusion (CATEX) or a Finding of No Significant  Impact  (FONSI), or a signed Record of Decision (ROD) when an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is completed. 1.9.  Public Announcements.  AF strategic basing actions are not announced to the public until approved  by  the  SecAF  or  SecAF  delegated  authority.    All  public  announcements  for  AF strategic  basing  decisions  require  coordination  through  the  Legislative  Liaison,  Office  of  the Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SAF/LL),  Public  Affairs,  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force (SAF/PA),  and  (as  required)  Congressional  Budget  and  Appropriations  Liaison,  Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Budget (SAF/FMBL). 10 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 Chapter 2 AIR FORCE STRATEGIC BASING STRUCTURE (AFSBS) 2.1.  Overview.  The  AFSBS  enables  the  AF  strategic  basing  process  by  supporting  an enterprise-wide, fact-centered review.  The  AFSBS presents  recommended courses of action to the  SecAF  for  making  criteria-based  strategic  basing  decisions.    The  top-down  deliberative elements  of  the  AFSBS  are  the  Strategic  Basing  Executive  Steering  Group  (SBESG)  and  the Strategic Basing Panel (SBP). 2.1.1.  The  ultimate  goals  of  the  AFSBS  are  to  provide  a  multifunctional,  cross-staff perspective  on  all  key  AF  strategic  basing  actions,  enhance  basing  issue  responsiveness, support interactive corporate decision-making, and bridge organizational barriers to improve the AF Strategic Basing Process. 2.1.2.  The AFSBS is informed by the National Defense Strategy, Air Force Strategic Master Plan  (SMP),  SMP  Strategic  Posture  Annex,  Quadrennial  Defense  Review  (QDR), CORONA-level  decisions,  analysis  performed  in  accordance  with  NEPA,  and  other applicable policy guidance and regulatory sources. 2.2.  SecAF and Chief of Staff, Air Force (CSAF).  The SecAF is the final decision authority for  AF  strategic  basing  actions  within  the  United  States,  its  territories  and  possessions,  unless otherwise delegated.  The CSAF assists the SecAF by providing advice on operational issues and military judgement.  For overseas basing actions requiring an Overseas Force Structure Change, the SecAF provides recommendations to the SecDef supporting the process described in AFI 10-504 and CJCSI 2300.02J. 2.3.  Strategic  Basing  Executive  Steering  Group  (SBESG).  The  SBESG  is  the  senior  forum (one-  and  two-star  general  officers  and  civilian  equivalents)  dedicated  to  cross-functional consideration  of  AF  strategic  basing  actions.    The  SBESG  reviews  and  evaluates  proposed actions  to  ensure  each  action  is  consistent  with  AF  concepts  of  operations  (CONOPS),  basing objectives,  criteria,  policies,  programming  and  planning,  and  presents  courses  of  action  to  the SecAF  and  CSAF  through  the  AFCS.    The  SBESG  also  returns  issues  requiring  additional information  or  work  to  the  basing  proponent  via  the  SBP.    The  SBESG  is  chaired  by  SAF/IEI with HQ AF/A8X (Director for Strategic Plans) and HQ AF/A8P (Director for Programs) as co-chairs.    Membership  consists  of  the  representatives  from  the  following  functional  areas: AF/A1M,  AF/A2R,  AF/A3O,  AF/A4L,  AF/A4C,  SAF/IEIB  (executive  secretariat),  AF/A8P, AF/A8X,  AF/A9R,  AF/A10,  AF/JAA,  AF/REX,  SAF/AQX,  SAF/CIO  A6,  SAF/FMB, SAF/GCN,  SAF/IEE,  SAF/IEI,  SAF/LLP,  SAF/PAO,  SAF/MG,  NGB/CF.  As  Required:  SAF/IA,  SAF/MRR,  AF/A3S,  AF/A3X,  AF/A3W,  AF/A4S,  AF/A5S,  AF/TE,  other Headquarters AF (HAF) offices, and MAJCOMs 2.4.  Strategic  Basing  Panel  (SBP).  As  required,  the  SBP  (O-6  and  civilian  equivalents) supports  the  SBESG  and  senior-level  leadership  as  a  forum  for  initial  corporate  review  and evaluation of appropriate issues within the same broad categories of the SBESG.  The SBP is the first  level  of  AFSBS  integration  for  basing  action  reviews.    The  SBP  is  chaired  by  SAF/IEIB.  Membership  consists  of  representatives  from  the  following  areas:  AF/A1MP,  AF/A3OT, AF/A4CP,  AF/A8PE,  AF/A8XF,  AF/A9RI,  AF/JAA,  AFLOA/JACE,  SAF/FMBL,  SAF/GCN, SAF/IEI,  SAF/IEIB,  SAF/LLP,  SAF/PAX,  SAF/CIO  A6,  NGB/A8FB,  MAJCOMs.  As AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 11 Required: AF/A2RM, AF/A3S, AF/A3X, AF/A3W, AF/A4LR, AF/A4LW, AF/A5S, AF/A4CA, AF/A10-O,  AF/REXP,  AF/TER,  SAF/AQX,  SAF/IAR,  SAF/IEE,  SAF/IEIP,  SAF/MRR, SAF/PAO, AF/A8X Mission Panels, Mission Support Panels, and other HAF offices. 12 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 Chapter 3 PROCESS 3.1.  Overview.  This  section  describes  the  strategic  basing  corporate  review  process  for standard, expedited or special-interest items.  For all AF strategic basing actions, the proponent will first submit a BAR to SAF/IEIB to initiate the AF Strategic Basing Process (T-1). 3.2.  Strategic  Basing  Action  Process  Steps.  Attachments  2  and  3  depict  the  standard  AF Strategic Basing Process. 3.2.1.  Upon  receipt  of  a  BAR,  SAF/IEIB  will  identify  the  lead  MAJCOM  for  weapon systems  basing  actions,  using  AFPD  10-9  as  a  reference.    SAF/IEIB  will  identify  the  lead MAJCOM for non-weapon systems basing  actions.  Note:  for the purposes of this  AFI, in some  cases  the  term  “designated  lead  MAJCOM”  may  not  be  a  formal  AF  MAJCOM,  but some other organization (e.g., the NGB or a FOA/DRU like the Air Force Flight Standards Agency). 3.2.1.1.  Dependent  on  the  respective  basing  action,  SAF/IEIB  may  identify  one  lead MAJCOM and one or more subordinate MAJCOMs, to include a FOA/DRU or the NGB, to coordinate as required. 3.2.2.  The  designated  lead  MAJCOM  will  coordinate  the  BAR  with  appropriate  agencies before SAF/IEIB schedules the action to meet the SBP. 3.2.2.1.  Consult  AFCEC/CZN  (NEPA  Division)  to  determine  anticipated  EIAP  actions to satisfy NEPA. NGB actions will execute NEPA through NGB/A4AM office and will coordinate with AFCEC as required. 3.2.2.2.  Coordinate actions involving a Major Weapon System with AF/A3O. 3.2.2.3.  Reference the BART (https://cs.eis.af.mil/sites/10010) for guidance on briefing formats and templates for each step in the Strategic Basing process. 3.2.3.  Initial Vector Check (IVC).  SAF/IEI will determine if a BAR requires a vector check.  The  IVC  is  intended  to  gain  AFSBS  guidance  on  a  strategic  basing  action  before  formal staffing through the AF Strategic Basing Process.  If an IVC is necessary, the designated lead MAJCOM will, in coordination with SAF/IEIB, prepare a presentation for the AFSBS.  The designated  lead  MAJCOM  will  incorporate  the  results  of  the  IVC  into  its  basing  criteria submission. 3.2.4.  SAF/IEI  will  provide  general  guidance  through  SAF/IEIB  to  the  designated  lead MAJCOM to frame the development of basing criteria and generate an enterprise wide list of installations  for  basing  consideration.    In  coordination  with  SAF/IEE  (Environment,  Safety and  Infrastructure)  and  SAF/IEIM  (Community  Partnership  and  Encroachment),  AF/A3O provides  operational  guidance,  including  range  and  airspace  considerations;  AF/A4C provides  guidance  for  the  development  of  environmental,  noise,  compatible  land  use,  and facility  criteria.    The  designated  lead  MAJCOM  will  apply  the  guidance  and  develop proposed specific basing criteria for the required action.  The designated lead MAJCOM will assign  weight  to  each  criterion  so  that  a  score  can  be  applied  to  each  basing  location,  as AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 13 directed in paragraph 3.2.6.  The designated lead MAJCOM will submit the proposed criteria to SAF/IEIB. 3.2.5.  SAF/IEIB  will  staff  for  review,  comment,  and  endorsement  the  proposed  enterprise and  criteria  through  the  SBP,  the  SBESG,  and  the  AF  Board  for  SecAF  approval.    Once approved,  SAF/IEIB  SAF/LL,  SAF/FMBL,  SAF/PA,  and  the  lead  MAJCOM  and  host MAJCOM  Public  Affairs  (PA)  offices  will  coordinate  public  and  congressional  release,  as required. 3.2.6.  The  designated  lead  MAJCOM  will  then,  in  coordination  with  all  affected MAJCOMs, gather data from the approved enterprise installations and assign scores to those installations  based  on  the  approved  criteria.    Data  collection  is  based  on  the  current conditions  at  the  installation  level.    Reuse  of  previous  data  gathering  requires  SAF/IEIB authorization.  The resulting scored enterprise-wide list is presented to the SBP, SBESG, and AF Board for review, validation, and endorsement for SecAF approval. 3.2.7.  The scored enterprise wide list is presented to the SecAF with SBESG and AF Board perspectives.  The SecAF selects the candidate list for site survey.  Once approved, SAF/LL, SAF/FMBL, SAF/PA, and the lead and host MAJCOM PA offices will coordinate the public announcement  of  the  candidate  list.    SAF/IEIB  will  provide  a  Site  Survey  Authorization Memorandum identifying the approved candidate list, in alphabetical order, for site survey to the  designated  lead  MAJCOM  along  with  a  site  Survey  Control  Number  (SCN)  for  the locations identified. 3.2.8.  The designated lead MAJCOM will generate and submit a draft AF 813  Request  for Environmental Impact Analysis, along with the BAR submission to AFCEC NEPA Division (or NGB/A4AM, if applicable) to initiate the EIAP. 3.2.9.  The designated lead MAJCOM, in coordination with the host MAJCOM as applicable, will  perform  site  surveys  for  all  approved  candidate  list  locations.    The  designated  lead MAJCOM  will  coordinate  with  AF/A9RI  to  accomplish  Basing  Life  Cycle  Cost  (BLCC) analysis for inclusion in the site survey report.  The designated lead MAJCOM will forward final site survey reports (reference paragraph 5.4) to SAF/IEIB as directed in the Site Survey Authorization Memorandum. 3.2.10.  SAF/IEIB  will  staff  the  site  survey  results  for  review,  validation,  and  endorsement through  the  SBP,  the  SBESG,  and  the  AF  Board  for  SecAF  approval  of  a  preferred alternative.    At  the  direction  of  the  SecAF,  other  candidate  bases  may  be  designated reasonable  alternatives  to  enable  EIAP  execution.    Once  a  preferred  location  is  approved, public  announcements  are  coordinated  with  SAF/LL,  SAF/FMBL,  SAF/PA,  and  the designated lead and host MAJCOM PA offices prior to release. 3.2.11.  After required public announcements of the preferred and reasonable alternatives, the designated lead MAJCOM, in coordination with the execution agent and proponent for EIAP, and host MAJCOM if applicable, will ensure the completion of the EIAP. This includes the initiation of interagency  and intergovernmental coordination letters and any required public scoping  announcements.    The  designated  lead  MAJCOM  will  forward  the  completed  EIAP documentation  to  HQ  AF/A4CP  and  SAF/IEIB  for  any  security  and  policy  review  and coordination with SAF/LL, SAF/FMBL, and SAF/PA. 14 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 3.2.12.  The  designated  lead  MAJCOM  will  not  execute  the  AF  strategic  basing  decision until  Congressional  notification(s)  is  complete,  a  BDM  or  ROD  is  issued  to  the  designated lead  MAJCOM  (with  a  copy  to  the  host  MAJCOM  as  applicable),  and  the  designated  lead and  host  MAJCOM  public  release  requirements  are  met.    SAF/IEIB  will  inform  HQ AF/A1M  (Director  of  Manpower,  Organization  and  Resources)  to  ensure  force  structure changes are placed into the annual AF Force Structure Announcement. 3.3.  Expedited Basing Actions.  There are circumstances when certain steps in the AF Strategic Basing Process are not necessary.  Expediting the process allows proponents to streamline steps in the AF Strategic Basing Process, which may reduce the time required to obtain a final basing decision.    The  final  approval  authority  for  expedited  basing  actions  is  the  SecAF  who  may delegate authority to SAF/IE (Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations, Environment and  Energy).    Further  delegation  is  authorized,  but  no  lower  than  SAF/IEIB.    Attachment  4 depicts the AF Strategic Basing Process for an expedited basing action. 3.3.1.  Expediting  a  basing  action  is  considered  the  exception,  not  the  rule.    When  an  AF strategic basing action qualifies as an expedited basing action, the designated lead MAJCOM will contact SAF/IEIB for specific instructions on how to proceed through the AF Strategic Basing Process.  For an AF strategic basing action to meet the requirements for the expedited process, it must qualify in at least one of the following three (3) SecAF-approved categories: 3.3.1.1.  Simple  –  an  action  that  meets  criteria  for  an  AF  strategic  basing  action (reference  paragraphs  1.7.1.1  –  1.7.1.7)  and  is  of  minimal  mission  and  non-significant environmental  impact  on  any  installation  selected  to  support  the  basing  requirement.  Examples of a simple action include (but are not limited to) non-AF entity requests less than 35 personnel, facility requirements with limited construction (i.e., O&M renovations when  no  Military  Construction  (MILCON)  is  necessary),  and  actions  with  low/minimal impact  to  base operating support.   This  does not apply to any  action that results in  the movement  of AF units or weapon systems  deemed AF or national  policy  significant,  or when the action itself is deemed AF or national policy significant. 3.3.1.2.  Specialized  –  an  action  that  supports  unique  mission  requirements  which  limit the enterprise of potential installations to one or more specific locations. 3.3.1.3.  Time-sensitive  –  an  action  which  has  SecAF  and  CSAF  documented  support (e.g.,  email)  for  an  accelerated  decision  timeline.    Factors  which  contribute  to  time-sensitive  basing  actions  include  (but  are  not  limited  to)  budgetary  constraints, Congressional time constraints, and critical mission degradation constraints. 3.3.2.  Proponents  who  request  consideration  for  an  expedited  strategic  basing  action  will provide  justification  within  the  completed  BAR  (reference  paragraph  3.1)  (T-1).    The  SBP will  analyze  the  BAR  to  determine  if  the  expedited  process  is  justified.    If  the  expedited request  is  not  supported,  the  proponent  will  revert  to  the  standard  Strategic  Basing  process (as  described  in  paragraph  3.2.).    If  the  expedited  process  is  approved,  SAF/IEIB  will establish the appropriate approval level in accordance with delegated authorizations. 3.3.3.  The  proponent  (with  designated  lead  MAJCOM  assistance  and  support  if  the proponent  is  a  non-AF  entity)  will  prepare  a  briefing  describing  the  basing  action  (T-1).  Reference the BART (https://cs.eis.af.mil/sites/10010) for guidance on briefing formats and templates for each step in the expedited Strategic Basing process. AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 15 3.3.4.  Qualification  for  an  expedited  AF  strategic  basing  action  can  be  overturned  at  any point during the AF Strategic Basing Process. 3.3.5.  Once  the  proponent  prepares  an  expedited  basing  action  briefing,  SAF/IEIB  will contact the designated lead MAJCOM and schedule an SBP.  The designated lead MAJCOM will  coordinate  the  expedited  proposal  with  HAF/A4C  and  AFCEC  NEPA  Division  (or NGB/A4AM for ANG hosted actions) to scope environmental concerns and assess the level of  EIAP  that  is  needed,  considering  that  NEPA  and  other  regulatory  actions  have  a  public review component, among other issues. 3.3.5.1.  If the action qualifies for a CATEX, the signed CATEX should accompany the basing action as soon as possible after approval and legal review is complete. 3.3.5.2.  If an EA or EIS is anticipated, initiation of consultation with resource agencies and  public  announcement  of  notices  of  availability  of  draft  EA/FONSIs  or  notices  of intent  to  prepare  an  EIS  will  be  coordinated  with  SAF/IEIB  and  should  not  occur  until after the SecAF approves the enterprise. 3.3.6.  If the proponent requires a site survey for an expedited basing action or if directed by the SBP/SBESG, see chapter 5 on procedures. 3.3.7.  Expedited basing actions approval options: 3.3.7.1.  SAF/IEIB review, validate, and approve or refer to SBESG 3.3.7.2.  SBESG review, validate, and approve or refer for SecAF approval 3.3.7.2.1.  If referred for SecAF approval, present action to the AF Board 3.3.7.2.2.  SecAF approval may be obtained by: 3.3.7.2.2.1.  SAF/IEI  presents  the  action  to  the  SecAF  during  the  in-cycle  AF Strategic Basing Update meeting, or 3.3.7.2.2.2.  SAF/IEIB  staffs  for  SecAF  approval  either  via  the  SecAF  Strategic Basing Monthly Update memorandum or by separate cover. 3.3.8.  As  necessary,  public  announcements  are  coordinated  with  SAF/LL,  SAF/FMBL, SAF/PA, and the designated lead and host MAJCOM PA offices prior to release. 3.4.  Finalizing  the  Basing  Decision.  No  basing  decision  is  final  until  proper  EIAP documentation is completed and approved at the appropriate level.  Additionally, Congressional notifications and other public announcements may be required, and must be properly coordinated and executed. 3.4.1.  Once  the  EIAP  is  complete,  SAF/IEIB  will  ensure  a  BDM  or  ROD  is  signed  at  the appropriate  level  within  the  Air  Staff.    If  required,  public  announcements  (or  Federal Register notices in the case of RODs) are coordinated with SAF/LL, SAF/FMBL, SAF/PA, and the designated lead and host MAJCOM PA offices prior to release.  For actions affecting ANG  installations,  NGB/LL  and  NGB/PA  will  facilitate  communication  with  state governments.  16 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 3.4.1.1.  If the EIAP concludes with a CATEX or FONSI, SAF/IEIB will prepare a BDM and inform SecAF (or delegated authority) through the SecAF Strategic Basing Monthly Update.    Following  congressional  notification  and  public  announcement  (if  required), SAF/IEIB (or designated authority) will sign and release the BDM, finalizing the basing decision and closing the basing action at the HAF level. 3.4.1.2.  If the EIAP concludes with a signed EIS ROD, the basing action is closed at the HAF level.   A signed ROD officially  documents the SecAF’s final basing decision  and precludes the need for a BDM. 3.4.2.  If  the  EIAP  presents  environmental  impact  information  that  renders  the  preferred alternative  impractical,  unsafe,  or  otherwise  detrimental,  the  SecAF  is  informed.    Based  on direction  from  the  SecAF,  SAF/IEIB  will  provide  instruction  on  the  way  forward  to  the proponent and designated lead MAJCOM. 3.5.  Special  Interest  Items.  Any  special  interest  items  as  determined  by  SAF/IEIB  that necessitate  AFCS  review  are  presented  to  the  SBP  and  SBESG.      Examples  include  but  not limited to airspace, range, and encroachment interest items. 3.6.  MAJCOM  Endorsement.  Lead  (or  Host)  MAJCOM  endorsement  (general  officer/flag officer/senior executive service official) of a BAR is necessary prior to formally entering the AF Strategic  Basing  process.    Similarly,  requests  from  non-AF  entities  require  appropriate headquarter level approval. 3.7.  Document  Distribution.  Pre-decisional  basing  analysis  is  for  internal  AF  use  on  a  strict “need-to-know”  basis  (reference  Department  of  Defense  Manual  (DoDM)  5200.01-V1,  DoD Information Security Program: Overview, Classification, and Declassification, and AFPD 16-14, Enterprise Security Governance).  Score sheets, site survey reports, briefings, and presentations (including  read-aheads  and  meeting  minutes)  are  distributed  only  to  authorized  personnel  and protected  as  For  Official  Use  Only  or,  as  appropriate,  at  the  higher  level  of  information classification. 3.7.1.  Limitations.    Access  to  pre-decisional  basing  information  by  industrial  firms  under contract to the AF should be limited to a strict “need-to-know” basis as provided in DoDM 5200.1-V1, AFI 16-1404, Air Force Information Security Program, Department of Defense (DoD)  5220.22-R,  Industrial  Security  Regulation,  and  AFI  16-1406,  Industrial  Security Program.    Limited general information may be released to the public, only as required and with  coordination  of  SAF/PA,  to  meet  NEPA  compliance,  or  other  legally  required  public notice  or  participation  requirements,  after  appropriate  security  and  policy  review  is completed. 3.8.  Decision Announcements.  AF strategic basing decisions are not releasable until approved by  the  SecAF  or  delegated  authority.    In  all  cases,  SAF/LL,  SAF/FMBL,  and  SAF/PA coordination is accomplished.  Overseas basing announcements follow AFI 10-504. AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 17 Chapter 4 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 4.1.

Consult  with  the  appropriate  Environmental  Planning  Function  (EPF)  when developing the  BAR and prior to  BAR submission.   The level  of EIAP  required to  support the basing action will depend on the scope of the proposed action and the anticipated level of environmental impacts. 22 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 4.18.3.  Direct  liaison  authority  is  permitted  between  SAF/IEIB  and  MAJCOM  basing organizations  upon  MAJCOM  endorsement  of  a  proposed  basing  action  from  formal submission of the BAR through final decision. 4.19.  Designated lead MAJCOMs will: 4.19.1.  Comply with the process in chapter 3. 4.19.2.  Coordinate  with  host  MAJCOM(s)  and  installation(s)  throughout  the  AF  Strategic Basing Process. 4.19.3.

Units and installations will support the process in chapter 3 (T-1). 4.20.2.  AF  installations  and/or  tenant  Wing  Commanders  shall  submit  all  requests  for  AF strategic basing actions through their MAJCOM basing organization (T-1). 4.20.3.  AF installations and/or tenant Wing Commanders contacted by non-AF entities with proposed AF strategic basing actions shall direct them to SAF/IEIB (T-1). 4.20.4.  No installation will allow a site survey by entities outside their MAJCOM without a valid site SCN (T-1). 4.20.5.  No  AF  installation  commander  will  allow  entities  to  beddown  without  the appropriate EIAP documentation and BDM or ROD (T-0). AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 23 Chapter 5 SITE SURVEYS 5.1.  Site  Surveys.  A  site  SCN  requires  written  approval  prior  to  the  earliest  basing  visit (exceptions may be granted by SAF/IEIB).  Intra-MAJCOM visits may be conducted without a site SCN provided the visit is exploratory in nature and does not require any public notifications and/or  announcements.    Note:    the  terms  site  survey  and  Site  Activation  Task  Force  (SATAF) visit  are  not  interchangeable.    See  Attachment  1  Terms  for  the  definitions  of  site  survey  and SATAF. 5.2.  Requesting  Site  Survey  Control  Numbers.  The  preferred  method  of  requesting  a  site SCN is through the BAR via the HAF BART (https://cs.eis.af.mil/sites/10010).  An alternative method  is  via  the  BAR  submitted  by  electronic  mail  to  SAF/IEIB  at  usaf.pentagon.saf-ie.mbx.saf-ieib-workflow@mail.mil  or  usaf.pentagon.saf-ie.mbx.saf-ie-saf-ieib-workflow-mbx@mail.smil.mil. 5.2.1.  Basing  actions  normally  receive  a  site  SCN  once  an  approved  candidate  list  is received from the HAF. 5.2.2.  Real  estate  actions  receive  site  SCNs  as  required  by  initiating  a  request  through  the SAF/IEIB website and providing a preliminary site plan and project concept briefing for the specific action. 5.3.  Survey  Coordination.  After lead MAJCOM/requesting entity must coordinate with the host MAJCOM(s) and installation(s) to be surveyed.  Site surveys within the NCR require notification and coordination with SAF/AAF.  A memo  (Attachment  6)  should  be  completed  and,  as  a  minimum,  contain  the  following information: site  SCN, receiving a the designated 5.3.1.  Attach relevant supporting documentation (i.e., BAR or feasibility study), which shall provide  initial  identification  of  infrastructure/environmental  concerns  and  any  other  issues that need to be addressed before and/or during the site survey. 5.3.2.  Team size and point of contact, to include name and grade of senior member. 5.3.3.  Initial statement of support needed by the survey team during the site visit (billeting, transportation, etc.). 5.3.4.  Proposed dates for each location of the site survey. 5.4.  Approval Authority.  SAF/IEIB has approval authority for all strategic basing site surveys.  SAF/IEIB may grant exceptions to documentation required to request a site SCN on  a case-by-case  basis.    Site  survey  approval  does  not  constitute  SecAF  approval  of  the  site  as  the  final basing location.  Site survey approval authority also does not constitute authority to execute AF strategic  basing  actions,  real  estate  related  actions,  or  approve  construction.    MAJCOMs  may expend funds to support general planning at approved site survey locations.   24 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 5.5.  Survey  Requirements.  The  proponent  shall  prepare  a  site  survey  report  following  the format  in  Attachment  7  (T-1)  and  reference  https://cs.eis.af.mil/sites/10010  for  current  format updates.    The  report,  consistent  with  the  basing  criteria,  addresses  costs  and  benefits  of  the proposed  action  (including  BLCC),  capacity  of  the  installation  to  support  the  proposed  action, assesses potential impacts to existing missions, housing, infrastructure, manpower, and any other applicable  BOS,  assesses  CONOPS  opportunities  to  operate  or  perform  the  mission  given  the candidate location’s specific capabilities and  capacity (with  particular  consideration to  airspace and  range  attribute,  accessibility,  and  capacity)  and  assesses  significant  airspace  and encroachment/compatible  land  use  issues.    Surveys  briefly  address  potential  environmental impacts,  length  of  time  required  to  complete  the  EIAP  (this  can  vary  widely  and  should  be evaluated early and factored in for each proposed action), proposed method of transaction (e.g., permit, license, lease where appropriate), and any additional interest areas as required.  Prior to submitting the final site survey report to SAF/IEIB, the proponent or designated lead MAJCOM shall obtain coordination on the report from the affected installation and the host MAJCOM (T-1).  Surveys  are due to  SAF/IEIB 60 days after  their completion or the completion of the final survey  of  multiple  installations  being  evaluated  for  a  single  AF  strategic  basing  action  and  are required at least 10 days prior to presentation to the SBP. 5.6.  Survey  Number  Usage.  SAF/IEIB  will  issue  a  unique  site  SCN  for  a  specific  survey  at affected installations, as identified in the BAR.  All correspondence shall reference this site SCN.  If  locations  other  than  those  originally  identified  in  the  request  need  to  be  surveyed,  contact SAF/IEIB to amend the BAR. 5.7.  Follow-on  Surveys.  Requesting  organizations  shall  coordinate  follow-on  surveys  and survey support to an already surveyed location through the host MAJCOM (T-1).  Approval for follow-on  surveys  is  not  required  from  SAF/IEIB;  however,  an  informational  copy  of  all correspondence  is  provided  to  SAF/IEIB.    Follow-on  survey  correspondence  uses  the  original site  SCN  followed  by  an  alpha-numeric  suffix  (e.g.,  SCN  10-017-AETC-1,  10-017-AETC-2, etc.). 5.8.  Overseas Site Surveys.  Site surveys at overseas locations, non-US territory or possessions follow  the  same  procedures  outlined  in  the  paragraphs  above.    See  AFI  10-504  for  additional information and requirements. AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 25 Chapter 6 TOTAL FORCE ENTERPRISE (TFE) 6.1.  Total  Force  Enterprise  (TFE).  The  AF  Strategic  Basing  Process  works  in  concert  with the  TFE  review  process  and  does  not  supersede  actions  or  decisions  outlined  in  AFI  90-1001 and/or  the  HQ  AF/A5/8  Total  Force  Evaluation  Board  (TFEB).    SAF/IEIB  will  work  closely with  HQ  AF/A8XF  to  ensure  all  levels  of  decision  making  are  coordinated,  with  objectives  of each  process  achieved.    In  general,  if  a  basing  location  is  in  question,  then  the  AF  Strategic Basing Process is used to determine the basing location. 6.2.  Database  Access.  SAF/IEIB  has  “read-only”  access  to  the  HQ  AF/A8XF  TFE  database.  Access  allows  maximum  awareness  of  new  TFI  proposals  staffed  through  the  TFE  review process and the ability to identify potential basing conflicts. 6.3.  SBP  Briefing.  Upon  administrative  review,  HQ  AF/A8XF  will  inform  SAF/IEIB  of  TFI proposals under consideration and support information-only briefings to the SBP. 6.4.  SBESG  Briefing.  HQ AF/A8XF will submit TEFB-recommended proposals to SAF/IEIB to support information-only briefings to the SBESG. 26 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 Chapter 7 PROGRAM OBJECTIVE MEMORANDUM (POM). 7.1.  Program  Objective  Memorandum  (POM).  The  AF  Strategic  Basing  Process  works  in concert  with  the  POM  process  to  ensure  all  levels  of  decision  making  is  coordinated  and  the objectives of each process are achieved. The AF Strategic Basing Process is the default method for making basing decisions.  The SAF/IEI representative to the AFCS will serve as the primary conduit for advising the AFCS on POM decisions with strategic basing implications. If a POM decision  is  made  without  a  specified  location,  then  the  AF  Strategic  Basing  Process  is  used  to determine the basing location.   If a location specification is required for the budget, AF/A8P will issue a memorandum through SAF/IE providing the rationale for waiving the basing process for SecAF approval. 7.2.  POM  Technical  Guidance.  AF/A8PE  will  issue  technical  guidance  regarding  issues  that would  otherwise  require  action  via  the  AF  Strategic  Basing  Process  based  on  input  from SAF/IEIB. 7.3.  SBP  Briefing.  Upon  administrative  review,  AF/A8PE  will  inform  SAF/IEIB  of  POM initiatives  with  basing  implications  and  support  information-only  briefings  to  the  SBP  and staffing for AFSBS documentation as required. AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 27 Chapter 8 DISCONNECTED AND UNCOVERED MANPOWER ACTIONS 8.1.  Disconnected  and  Uncovered  Manpower  Actions.  SAF/IE  will  inform  the  SecAF  and CSAF of any potential disconnected or uncovered manpower resulting from a basing action via electronic-mail,  memorandum,  or  the  SecAF  Strategic  Basing  Monthly  Update  (depending  on the  sensitivity  of  the  issue).    This  information  serves  as  an  IVC  in  which  the  SecAF  will determine whether an expedited basing decision is necessary.  If the SecAF and CSAF determine the disconnected or uncovered manpower action is time-sensitive, an O-6 level Tiger Team, led by SAF/IEIB, may be directed to convene.  The Tiger Team will develop a course(s) of action list  to  address  the  disconnected  or  uncovered  manpower  action.    If  the  SecAF  and  CSAF determine  the  action  is  not  time-critical,  then  the  lead  MAJCOM  will  follow  the  AF  Strategic Basing  Process  as  outlined  in  paragraph  3.2  for  determination  of  any  secondary  mission(s).  Attachment  5  depicts  the  AF  Strategic  Basing  Process  for  disconnected  and  uncovered manpower  actions.    This  instruction  clarifies  the  process  for  manpower  disconnects  related  to basing and does not supersede existing manpower management policy specified in AFI 38-201, Management  of  Manpower  Requirements  and  Authorizations,  and  AFI  38-204,  Programming USAF  Manpower.    See  Attachment  1  Terms  for  the  definition  of  disconnected  and  uncovered manpower. 28 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 Chapter 9 REAL ESTATE ACTIONS 9.1.  Real Estate Actions.  The AF Strategic Basing Process works in concert with the real estate process and does not supersede actions outlined in the 32-9000 series of AFIs dealing with real property management.  The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations, Environment, and  Energy  (SAF/IE)  has  overall  responsibility  and  oversight  of  Air  Force-controlled  real property.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations (SAF/IEI) provides AF  real  property  policy,  approvals,  and  oversight  guidance  as  delegated  by  SAF/IE.    Actions include licenses, permits, and easements. 9.2.  SBP  and  SBESG  Briefings.  Once  a  real  estate  action  is  forwarded  to  SAF/IEI  for approval,  SAF/IEI  will  include  SAF/IEIB  on  the  HAF  coordination  of  major  actions.    Major actions  are  as  determined  by  SAF/IEI.    Information  in  the  real  estate  action  is  used  to  provide informational briefings to the SBP and the SBESG by AFCEC. 9.3.  Real  Estate  Survey  Control  Numbers.  SAF/IEIB  will  accept  a  draft  feasibility  study, preliminary  site  development  plans  or  like  documents,  except  when  the  AF  Strategic  Basing Process  requires  additional  information  for  issuance  of  a  site  SCN.    SAF/IEIB  will  notify  the requestor (SAF/IEI and/or AFCEC) when additional information is necessary. AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 29 Chapter 10 JOINT BASES 10.1.  Joint Bases.  AF units must follow the AF Strategic Basing Process when considering an AF strategic basing action at a joint base or joint region location; non-AF entities follow chapter 12  (T-1).    In  staffing  for  a  joint  base  location,  the  requestor  should  address  the  rationale  for locating  on  a  joint  base.    If  the  AF  is  the  supporting  Component  at  a  joint  base  under consideration for an AF  strategic basing action, then the requestor will identify the TOA being transferred within the AF  (T-1).  If the AF is  the supported Component, then the requestor will identify  the  TOA  being  transferred  to  the  supporting  Component  (T-1).    If  approved,  the requesting  organization/MAJCOM  must  comply  with  all  USD  (AT&L)  guidance  and  related DODIs for basing and inter/intra-service support.  (T-0) One such document is the “Department of Defense Supplemental Guidance for Implementing and Operating a Joint Base - New Mission Stationing/Beddown.” Note: Joint Reserve Bases are defined as having facilities used by two or more reserve components (see: title 10 USC Chapter 1803, sections 18231 through 18240) and are not considered Joint Bases as defined in this paragraph. 10.2.  Air  Force-Led  Joint  Base.  Proponent  (i.e.,  supported  and  non-supported  tenants)  must submit a BAR through the appropriate designated lead MAJCOM (reference paragraph 3.2.1) to SAF/IEIB to initiate the AF Strategic Basing Process (T-1). 10.2.1.  Proponent  must  follow  the  process  as  outlined  in  paragraphs  3.2  or  3.3,  as appropriate (T-1). 10.2.2.  Proponent must document Intermediate Command Summit support for basing action (Joint Management Oversight Structure) (T-1). 30 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 Chapter 11 OVERSEAS BASING 11.1.  Overseas Basing.  See AFI 10-504 and CJCSI 2300.02J. 11.2.  OCONUS  Basing  Matrix.  HQ  AF/A3  has  developed  a  basing  tool  that  can  support  the development of basing criteria for OCONUS basing actions.  The matrix is designed to identify the  operational  value  of  an  installation  or  the  force  structure  changes  at  OCONUS  bases.    The proponent and designated lead MAJCOM will coordinate with HQ AF/A3OT for access to and assistance with the OCONUS Basing Matrix (T-1). AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 31 Chapter 12 NON-AF ENTITIES ONTO AF INSTALLATIONS 12.1.  Initial  Request.  The  non-AF  entity’s  top-level  headquarters  element  for  approving  a basing  action  will  submit  a  BAR  to  SAF/IEIB  (T-0).    Either  SAF/IEIB  or  a  designated  lead MAJCOM will assist the non-AF entity in articulating criteria to allow an enterprise-wide look.  The request should specify how the move benefits the AF or joint readiness requirements. 12.2.  Request Coordination.  SAF/IEIB will coordinate the BAR for host MAJCOM and HAF input, as required.  The host MAJCOM will be kept informed of BAR status. 12.3.  Basing Process.  If the BAR is approved, and after receiving a site SCN, non-AF entities are  expected  to  follow  the  same  strategic  basing  procedures  and  requirements  as  AF  entities.  Upon  SecAF  approval  of  the  basing  action,  a  BDM  or  ROD  is  issued  to  the  designated  lead MAJCOM authorizing the non-AF entity to execute the approved action.  Once a BDM or ROD has  been  issued,  the  non-AF  entity  is  responsible  for  completing  required  congressional notifications and public affairs announcements in coordination with the designated lead and host MAJCOMs.    Support  needs  to  be  negotiated  with  the  host  installation  or  MAJCOM  through  a Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA).    Services  should  refer  to  DODI  4000.19,  Support Agreements and AFI 25-201, Intra-Service, Intra-Agency, and Inter-Agency Support Agreement Procedures. 12.4.  Public  Education.  Public  schools,  universities,  and  non-AF  education  activities  follow the non-AF entity process. 32 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 Chapter 13 AF ENTITIES ONTO NON-AF INSTALLATIONS 13.1.  AF  Entities  onto  Non-AF  Installations.  AF  entities  requesting  to  move  onto  non-AF installations  shall  follow  the  AF  Strategic  Basing  Process  as  outlined  in  chapter  3  to  obtain SecAF  approval.    The  proponent’s  designated  lead  MAJCOM  is  required  to  submit  a  BAR  to SAF/IEIB  and  receive  HAF  approval  prior  to  submitting  requests,  conducting  site  surveys,  or actively  pursuing  basing  options  on  non-AF  property.    SAF/IEIB  will  coordinate  requests  with the  proponent,  designated  lead  MAJCOM,  HAF,  and  the  real  property  owner  to  provide  the proponent/designated lead MAJCOM with a basing decision.  The proponent should address the reasons for needing to be located on a non-AF installation and the additional costs to the AF if approved.  If movement onto a non-AF installation is approved by the SecAF, the proponent will then be required to follow the host-Service basing process (T-1). AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 33 Chapter 14 ENCROACHMENT/COMPATIBLE LAND USE 14.1.  Encroachment/Compatible Land Use.  The Encroachment Management Working Group (EMWG)  will  recommend  encroachment/compatible  land  use  issues  for  SBESG  review  and recommendation.  SAF/IEIB will, after SBP review, schedule encroachment/compatible land use issues  for  SBESG  and  AFCS  review  and  for  the  SecAF  and  CSAF  review  and  approval  as required.  Services should refer to AFPD 90-20, Encroachment Management Program. 34 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 Chapter 15 AF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS PROCESS (EIAP) 15.1.  AF  Environmental  Impact  Analysis  Process  (EIAP)  .    The  proponent  (typically  the designated  lead  MAJCOM)  of  an  AF  strategic  basing  action  is  responsible  for  initiating, complying  with,  and  funding  the  EIAP  in  accordance  with  32  CFR  Part  989.    The  designated lead  MAJCOM  will  coordinate  and  work  with  their  EPF  and/or  AFCEC  to  support  the  EIAP.  All  AF  strategic  basing  action  information,  released  to  the  public  as  part  of  the  EIAP,  is coordinated with HQ AF/A4CP and approved through SAF/IEIB.  Approval is granted once the release is coordinated through Air Force senior leaders, SAF/LL, SAF/FMBL, and SAF/PA, and proper notifications are made. 15.2.  Procedures.  The AF implements the environmental analysis process as promulgated in 32 CFR Part 989.  This regulation provides procedures for environmental impact analysis within the United  States  and  abroad,  fully  complies  with  the  NEPA,  and  incorporates  AF  specific requirements.  Coordination with the EPF and integration of the EIAP during the initial planning stages  (or  Planning  Requirements  in  the  EIAP  (PREIAP))  of  proposed  basing  actions  ensures planning and decisions reflect environmental requirements, avoid delays later in the process, and preclude potential conflict. 15.2.1.  Proponents  are  responsible  for  ensuring  the  EIAP  is  properly  timed  and  completed for proposed actions.  Proponents will ensure basing requests reflect all essential information on how it complies with the AF’s EIAP  (T-1).  Proponents will coordinate the purpose and need for action with their EPF, which then is reflected in their BAR submittal (T-1). 15.2.2.  AF  Form  813,  Request  for  Environmental  Impact  Analysis,  is  used  to  initiate  the EIAP  and  a  copy  is  sent  to  SAF/IEIB  with  an  anticipated  EIAP  key  milestones  and completion dates.  The AF Form 813 clearly presents the Purpose and Need for the proposed action as well as the Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA). 15.3.  Environmental  Baseline  Survey  (EBS).  Proponents  will  comply  with  AFI  32-7066, Environmental Baseline Surveys in Real Estate Transactions (T-1). AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 35 Chapter 16 EXEMPTIONS TO THE BASING PROGRAM 16.1.  Air  National  Guard  Bases.  On  a  case-by-case  basis,  basing  actions  on  an  Air  National Guard  base  may  exempted  from  the  basing  process  by  SAF/IEIB  after  coordination  with  the NGB  and  consideration  of  DODI  1225.08,  10  U.S.C.  section  18238,  and  32  U.S.C.  section 104(a). 16.2.  Exempted Non-Air Force Entities.  Requests for use of real property by non-AF entities that benefit the AF, have no significant environmental impacts as demonstrated through timely, appropriate and completed EIAP documentation that satisfies requirements in 32 CFR 989, and do not adversely impact base missions or BOS funds are exempted from the AFSBS so long as the requested use falls within the exemptions listed below or is otherwise exempted by SAF/IEIB on a case-by-case basis.  These include, but are not limited to: 16.2.1.  Banks and Credit Unions. 16.2.2.  Post Offices. 16.2.3.  Grazing and Cropland leases. 16.2.4.  Utility  and  Road  Easements  of  a  typical  right-of-way  nature.    Major  transmission lines,  wind  turbines,  solar  towers,  and  other  energy  generating  projects  are  staffed  through the EMWG for HAF action.  Projects requiring the base to create/relocate an access gate are not exempt. 16.2.5.  Utilities and Roads granted by lease and license (e.g., telephone equipment boxes in a building, underground communications cables, use of AF poles for telephone lines, storm drainage  ditch,  rail  spur;  radio  relay  link,  transmitter/receiver  tower,  cellular  telephone towers, and above ground pipelines).  Electronic emanation utilities are subject to frequency de-confliction. 16.2.6.  Military Exchange retail, warehouse, and support operations. 16.2.7.  Commissaries. 16.2.8.  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  support  activities  (e.g.,  trap  club,  archery  club, riding stables). 16.2.9.  Base  support  activities  (e.g.,  American  Red  Cross,  thrift  shop,  labor  union  offices, Civil  Air  Patrol,  Lighthouse  for  the  Blind  base  supply  stores,  Department  of  Defense Dependents Schools, Fisher House).       36  AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 16.2.10.  Outgrants or ingrants for use of facilities involving terms of five (5)  years or less, construction  of  temporary  structures,  or  renewals  that  result  in  no  new  resource  impacts  to the  AF  are  exempt  from  the  requirements  of  this  instruction.    Actions  which  benefit  the installation  require  compliance  with  the  AF  instructions  dealing  with  real  property management.  RICHARD K.

This includes  members of the Reserve Components serving on active duty or full-time training duty, but does not include full-time National Guard duty. Air  Force  Real  Property—Air  Force  real  property  is  any  right,  title,  or  interest  in  land, buildings,  fixed  improvements,  utilities,  and  other  permanent  additions  to  land.    Examples include  equipment  attached  to,  and  made  part  of,  buildings  and  structures  (such  as  heating systems), but not movable equipment (such as plant equipment). Basing—The  process  used  to  determine  the  location  of  a  unit, mission,  activity,  or  manpower.  Basing  involves  actions  taken  to  position  AF  units  (on  AF  or  non-AF  property)  or  non-AF entities on AF real property. Basing  Action  Request  (BAR)—The  formal  request  required  by  SAF/IEIB  to  initiate  the  AF Strategic Basing Process.  The proponent of a proposed basing action will complete and submit the BAR to SAF/IEIB. Beddown—The  execution  of  a  SecAF-approved  basing  action  establishing  a  unit,  mission, activity,  or  manpower  on  AF  real  property  or  AF  installation  for  longer  than  one  year.    This applies  to  activities  of  all  military  branches,  other  DoD  agencies,  non-DoD  federal,  state  and local  governmental  agencies,  and/or  private  agencies  requesting  the  use  of  Air  Force  real property. Base  Realignment  and  Closure  (BRAC)—The  process  under  Public  Law  (PL)  100-526 (BRAC 88) and PL 101-510 that the DoD has used to reorganize its installation infrastructure to more  efficiently  and  effectively  support  its  force  structure,  increase  operational  readiness,  and facilitate new ways of doing business through closure and/or realignment of bases above where actions exceed thresholds established in 10 United States Code (USC) § 2687. Contingency—An  emergency,  event  or  series  of  events  involving  military  forces  caused  by natural  or  human  disasters,  terrorists,  subversives,  international  instabilities  or  by  required military  operations.    Due  to  the  uncertainty  of  the  situation,  contingencies  require  plans,  rapid response and special procedures to ensure the safety and readiness of personnel, installations and equipment. Continental United States (CONUS—)—The contiguous United States territory, including the adjacent territorial waters, located within North America between Canada and Mexico. Description  of  Proposed  Action  and  Alternatives  (DOPAA)—Attached to an AF Form 813, Request  for  Environmental  Impact  Analysis,  initiates  the  required  assessment  of  environmental impacts  associated with  proposed program  actions as mandated by  the  National  Environmental Policy  Act  of  1969  (PL  91-190).    The  AF  Form  813  contains  two  main  elements:  the  Purpose and Need for the Action and the DOPAA.  The AF Form 813 identifies the need for the proposed action,  defines  the  scope  of  the  action,  discusses  reasonable  alternatives,  and  helps  in determining the appropriate level of environmental analysis required. Disconnected (unearned) Manpower— Manpower Authorizations (UMD) and/or End Strength (FYDP)  resources  that  are  deliberately  disconnected  from  a  requirement,  organization,  or AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 43 mission realigned to implement a Strategic Basing decision.  Manpower that is not moved with a realigned requirement and connected to another or new requirement is a disconnected resource. Enhanced Use Leasing—The National Defense Authorization Act (PL 106-398, Section 2812) (see  10  USC  §  2667)  establishes  authority  for  long-term  outgrant  leasing  of  AF  real  property.  The  lease  may  provide  for  the  alteration,  repair,  or  improvement  of  the  leased  property  by  the Lessee  as  part  of  the  lease,  including  maintenance,  protection,  alteration,  or  restoration  of  AF real  property.    This  includes  construction  of  new  facilities,  facilities  as  operational  support,  or other on-base services.  The lease is characterized by significant Lessee investment that includes site  identification,  competitive  grantee  selection,  strategic  basing  analysis,  and  senior-level negotiations for final closing. Enterprise—The enterprise of AF installations is comprised of all Active Duty (or Regular) Air Force,  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  and  Air  National  Guard  major  and  minor  installations  as defined  in  AFPD  10-5,  Basing.    The  AF  enterprise  also  includes  AF-supported  joint  bases  and other sites greater than 50 acres where the AF owns the underlying land (i.e., missile sites, AF-owned contractor-operated plants). Enterprise-wide  Look  (EWL)—The  process  of  applying  the  basing  criteria  developed  by  the proponent  and  approved  by  the  SecAF  to  score  major/minor  installations  and  sites  worldwide.  The  enterprise  could  be  as  large  as  approximately  200  AF  locations,  but  the  size  is  ultimately dependent on operational requirements and the nature of the mission being evaluated for basing.  Once  the  locations  have  been  quantitatively  evaluated  against  the  SecAF-approved  basing criteria, the SBP will meet to review the scored lists to produce a ranked potential candidate list.  When  the  candidate  list  is  endorsed  by  the  SBESG  and/or  approved  by  the  SecAF  and  CSAF, these locations are eligible for site survey requests and are subject to the Environmental Impact Analysis  Process  as  a  reasonable  range  of  alternatives  for  the  proposed  basing  action.    This deliberate process should produce repeatable and consistent results. Environmental  Impact  Analysis  Process  (EIAP)—The  National  Environmental  Policy  Act (NEPA) of 1969 requires analysis of the environmental effects of major federal actions. AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process, as promulgated at 32 CFR Part 989, governs AF NEPA compliance for installations in the United States and its territories. Environmental  Documentation—The  documents  specified  in  40  CFR  paragraph  1508.9 (environmental  assessment),  40  CFR  paragraph  1508.11  (environmental  impact  statement),  40 CFR  paragraph  1508.13  (finding  of  no  significant  impact),  and  40  CFR  paragraph  1508.22 (notice  of  intent).    Additional  Air  Force-specific  guidance  for  overseas  EIAP  can  be  found  in Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 989 (32 CFR 989.37-.38).  See 32 CFR 989 and AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process, for more details. Environmental Planning Function (EPF)—The environmental office or unit that manages the EIAP  in  support  of  the  proponent  for  implementation  of  the  action.    Duties  can  include completion of EPF portions of the AF Form 813, review and application of CATEXs, facilitation of  the  PREIAP,  support  for  DOPAA  development,  identification  of  an  interdisciplinary  team, and management of the EIAP and contract for completing analyses and required documentation.  Air Force NEPA Center (AFCEC/CZN) is the EPF for all EISs and high profile EAs. 44 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 Host MAJCOM—The AF major command(s) owning the installation(s) affected by a proposed basing action (e.g., affected by site surveys (Enterprise-wide List), by the EIAP (Environmental Impact Analysis Process), and/or by a SATAF for beddown execution). Industrial  Facility—Any  Air  Force-owned,-  leased,  or  -controlled  real  property  facility  that  a contractor  uses  to  perform  Government  research,  development,  test,  evaluation,  production, maintenance, or modification or to store production machinery and equipment in support of such activity. Lead  MAJCOM/Command—The  AF  major  command  or  other  entity  as  designated  by SAF/IEIB  per  paragraph  3.2.1  to  champion  a  proposed  basing  action  through  the  AF  Strategic Basing Process from initial BAR submission through beddown. Military  Judgment—A  qualitative  process  exercised  by  AF  senior  leadership  that  evaluates basing actions with respect to Plans and Guidance, Global Posture, Building Partnerships, Total Force,  Beddown  Timing,  Force  Structure,  Training  Requirements  and  Efficiencies,  Logistics Supportability, and Resources/Budgeting to make strategic basing decisions. Non-Air Force Real Property—Real property not owned or managed by the Department of the Air Force. Non-Air Force Entity—Any unit, group, or organization not part of the Air Force (e.g., private, commercial,  non-profit,  local  government,  state  government,  federal  government  or  Service other than AF). Organization  Action—Reference  chapter  4  of  AFI  38-101  for  a  description  of  organization terminology  and  procedures.    With  respect  to  strategic  basing,  if  an  organization  action/event entails activation, inactivation, designation, redesignation or assignment of an organization entity (unit and/or non-unit) that  changes the number of AF positions at  an installation by at  least  35 positions,  then  this  action/event  must  be  vetted  through  the  AF  Strategic  Basing  Process.  Manpower actions (e.g., application of new logistics composite model or manpower determinant, OSD  or  AFCS  program  adjustments,  etc.)  that  affect  the  number  of  positions  at  an  installation are not subject to this instruction. Organization  Change  Request—A  request  for  organization  action  such  as  unit  activation, inactivation, redesignation, or variation to a standard structure as depicted in AFPD 38-1 or AFI 38-101. Outgrant  Lease—A  conveyance  of  an  exclusive,  possessory  interest  in  non-excess,  AF-controlled  real  property  pursuant  to  the  authority  of  10  USC  §  2667  offered  in  exchange  for consideration equal to or greater than the property’s fair market value in cash or in kind. Outside of the Continental United States (OCONUS)—Outside the contiguous United States to include Alaska, Hawaii, and all other countries. Planning Requirements in the EIAP (PREIAP)—Emphasizes early interdisciplinary planning and  promotes  coordinated  and  consistent  implementation  of  repeatable  processes  to  achieve timely decisions on Air Force action proposals. Programming Plan (PPlan)—A directive, coordinated document consisting of a Basic Plan and supporting  functional  staff  annexes  which  defines  the  actions  required  and  outlines  the responsibilities for achieving a given program objective.  The primary types of actions for which PPlans  are  developed  include  unit  activations  and  inactivations;  realignments  involving  the AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 45 physical move of people or assets; base closures; beddown of weapon systems; unit conversions from  one  weapon  system  to  another;  beddown  and/or  integration  of  specialized  systems  or unique  organizational  constructs;  and  increases  or  decreases  in  a  unit's  Primary  Aerospace Vehicle Inventory (PAI). Programming  Message  (PMsg)—A  PMsg  may  be  used  in  lieu  of  a  PPlan  when  less comprehensive  documentation  will  suffice  to  implement  a  program  objective.    For  example,  a PMsg is often utilized when limited functional involvement is required to execute the action.  A PMsg  may  also  be  used  as  an  interim  measure  to  establish  the  overall  goal  and  provide  basic guidance  pertaining  to  a  major  program  action  while  more  comprehensive  documentation  is being developed.  This is the method of choice when planning time is limited. Program  Action  Directive  (PAD)—PADs are  generated at  the Air Staff level  and are used to direct MAJCOM development of PPlans/PMsgs for program actions already in the PB or which are to be worked into the PB through standard processes. Program Change Request (PCR)—Air Force program actions are authorized by the President's Budget (PB).  Formulation of the PB is a cyclic process.  A PCR is a tool submitted by the Air Staff through AF/A8PE or a MAJCOM which is used to initiate proposed out-of-cycle changes to programs contained in the PB. Program  Guidance  Letter  (PGL)—A  formal  planning  document  that  establishes  direction, assigns tasks, and provides guidance (i.e., Morale, Welfare, and Recreation/Services integration or Civil Air Patrol reorganization). Proponent—The office, unit, or activity at any level that initiates an Air Force basing action. Site  Activation  Task  Force  (SATAF)—A  team  of  MAJCOM  functional  experts  chartered  to travel  to  an  installation  to  identify  all  the  actions  required  to  ensure  the  SecAF-approved  final basing  decision  is  successfully  executed  at  an  installation  after  completion  of  the  AF  Strategic Basing Process.  SATAFs are led by a MAJCOM, and provide periodic, on-scene assistance to unit-level  agencies to  accomplish  a program  objective.   It  employs appropriate members of the MAJCOM  staff  and  may  include  HAF  functionals.    The  SATAF  structure  is  comprised  of headquarters  team  members  and  representation  from  the  affected  unit(s),  which  are  organized into functional working groups.  Each working group has an assigned chairperson, who functions under the auspices of the SATAF Team Chief.  A SATAF may be convened to support bringing a program, system, equipment and/or site to operational readiness. SATAFs are also conducted to  facilitate  unit  activations,  inactivations,  relocations,  and  conversions  from  one  weapons system to another. Site Survey—An authorized installation visit by an individual or team to survey real property to determine its feasibility for a proposed unit or mission beddown for SecAF approval during the AF  Strategic  Basing  Process.    Site  surveys  may,  in  part,  consist  of  preliminary  examinations, field investigations, etc. Site  Visit—A visit to  a site to  perform operational  or managerial  activities.  Examples include oversight  of programs,  grant  operations or management  activities for internal  control purposes; carry  out  an  audit,  inspection  or  repair  activity;  conduct  negotiations;  provide  instructions;  and provide technical assistance.  For purposes of this AFI, this definition is augmented to include an informal visit to a site to gather preliminary information unrelated to a specific basing action(s).  46 AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 Unit  commanders  and  headquarters  agencies  are  not  restricted  from  making  contact  with  other MAJCOMs as part of the site visit planning process. Uncovered  Manpower—A  situation  that  arises  when  an  AF  mission  (e.g.,  weapon  system, manpower  positions,  etc.)  moves  from  one  location  to  another,  is  reduced  or  is  eliminated leaving  the  existing  manpower  at  the  losing  location  without  a  mission.    Being  without  a mission,  the  affected  manpower  is  considered  uncovered.    Although  rare  and  most  common among the Air Reserve Component, an uncovered manpower situation is possible at any location where an AF mission exists. U.S.  Territories—Territories  associated  with,  or  administered  by,  the  U.S.  Government, including  but  not  limited  to  the  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico,  American  Samoa,  Guam,  the Commonwealth  of  the  Northern  Marianas  Islands,  Johnston  Atoll,  Midway  Island,  Virgin Islands, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and Wake Island.  AFI10-503  28 JULY 2017 47 Attachment 2 AF STRATEGIC BASING PROCESS (FUNCTIONAL) Figure A2.1.
