This guidance establishes requirements and grading criteria for ground and flight phases  of  initial,  requalification,  and  periodic  flight  evaluations.    Aircrew  evaluations  will  be conducted  IAW  this  guidance  and  AFI 11202,  Vol 2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation Program,  as  supplemented.    Specific  areas  for  evaluation  are  prescribed  to  ensure  an  accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of aircrews.  Flight  examiners use the AFI when conducting  aircrew  evaluations.    Instructors  use  this  guidance  when  preparing  aircrews  for qualification.  Waiver, supplement, evaluation procedures, grading instructions and requirements sections  are  Tier  2  requirements  and  can  only  be  waived  by  MAJCOM/CC  or  delegate  unless otherwise noted.  (T-2) 1.2.  Applicability.  This  guidance  applies  to  all  individuals  performing  crew  duties  on  any C130J  variant.    Evaluations  for  all  crew  positions  can  be  given  on  any  appropriate  C-130J, Weapons  System  Trainers  (WST),  aircrew  training  device  (ATD),  or  Part  Task  Trainer  (PTT) unless stated otherwise. 1.3.  Keywords and Definitions. 1.3.1.  “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.3.2.  “Should”  is  normally  used  to  indicate  a  preferred,  but  not  mandatory,  method  of accomplishment. 1.3.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.4.  “Note:”  indicates  operations  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  considered  essential  to emphasize. 1.4.  Waivers.  Waiver authority for the contents of this document is AF/A3O.  IAW AFI 11202, Vol 2, the MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for individual aircrew requirements on a case-by-case  basis,  but  the  MAJCOM/A3  may  not  approve  blanket  or  group  (two  or  more  aircrew) waivers.    Waiver  requests  should  be  submitted  through  MAJCOM  Standardization  and Evaluation channels to the A3.  As applicable, MAJCOM/A3 will forward requests to AF/A3O, with an info copy to AF/A3OI.  (T-2) 1.4.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. 1.4.1.1.  “Tier 1”  (T-1) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance may  put  airman  or  mission  strongly  at  risk,  and  may  only  be  waived  by  the MAJCOM/CC or delegate.  This AFI contains Tier 1 requirements. 1.4.1.2.  “Tier  2”    (T-2)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  potentially  put the  mission  at  risk  or  potentially  degrade  the  mission  or  program,  and  may  only  be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate. 1.4.1.3.  “Tier 3”  (T-3) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance has  a  remote  risk  of  mission  failure,  and  may  be  waived  by  the  Wing/CC  but  no  lower than the OG/CC.   6  AFI11-2EC-130JV2  16 JUNE 2015 1.5.  Supplements.  Units are encouraged to supplement this guidance with standard evaluation profiles that best fit the unit’s mission, equipment, and location.  MAJCOMs will forward a copy of  MAJCOM  supplements  to  AF/A3OI,  through  HQ  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command (AFSOC)/A3V,  for  approval.

HQ  AFSOC/A3V  will  forward changes to AF/A3OI for final approval prior to implementation.  (T-2) to 1.7.  Evaluation  Procedures.  Before  the  Aircraft  Commander  Briefing,  the  evaluator  will inform  the  aircraft  commander  of  any  special  requirements.    Flight  examiners  will  brief  the examinee on the conduct, purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as  all applicable evaluation criteria, prior to flight.  The examinee will accomplish all required mission planning.  If an Operations Planning Team or Deployment Planning Team accomplishes mission planning, the examinee is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all mission-planning paperwork.  Flight  examiners will be furnished a copy of necessary  charts, flight  logs, mission folders, and any additional items they deem necessary.  (T-2) 1.7.1.  Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior to initial/requalification evaluations. 1.7.2.  Unless  requested  by  examinee  and  approved  by  squadron  supervision,  the  examinee will be current for all events evaluated during a periodic evaluation. 1.7.3.  Flight  examiners  will  not  intentionally  fail  any  equipment  during  flight  evaluations, but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight. 1.7.4.  Under no circumstances will a pilot flight examiner allow the aircraft to slow to below one engine inoperative air minimum control speed (Vmca), regardless of airspeed tolerances listed for specific areas. 1.7.5.  Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight.  During the critique,  the  flight  examiner  will  review  the  examinee’s  overall  rating,  specific  deviations, area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required. 1.8.  Grading Instructions.  All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202, Vol 2 as supplemented, and this volume.  Examiners will use  the criteria contained in  this volume to accomplish all flight, simulator, and emergency procedures evaluations.  To ensure standard and objective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.  (T-2) 1.8.1.  Area/Subarea  Grades.    Areas/subareas  will  have  a  two-level  (Q/U)  or  three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system.  Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas. AFI11-2EC-130JV2  16 JUNE 2015   7  1.8.1.1.  Q.    is  the  desired  level  of  performance.    The  examinee  demonstrated  a satisfactory  knowledge  of  all  required  information,  performed  aircrew  duties  within  the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission. 1.8.1.2.  Q-.    indicates  the  examinee  is  qualified  to  perform  the  assigned  area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner.  Deviations  from  established  standards  must  not  exceed  the  prescribed  Q-  tolerances  or jeopardize flight safety. 1.8.1.3.  U.    indicates  a  breach  of  flight  discipline,  performance  outside  allowable parameters  or  deviations  from  prescribed  procedures/tolerances  that  adversely  affected mission  accomplishment  or  compromised  flight  safety.    An  examinee  receiving  an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training.  When, in the judgment of the  flight  examiner,  if  additional  training  will  not  constructively  improve  examinee’s performance, it is not required.  In this case, the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief the examinee. 1.8.2.  Critical  Areas.    Critical  areas  require  adequate  accomplishment  by  the  aircrew member  in  order  to  successfully  achieve  the  mission  objectives.    If  an  aircrew  member receives  an  unqualified  grade  in  any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will also  be  unqualified.    Critical  areas  are  identified  by  “(Critical)”  in  the  area  title  and  by shading of the Q- block on the appropriate AFSOC Form 48,  Flight Evaluation Worksheet, (evaluation worksheet) or AF Form 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet. 1.9.  Evaluation  Requirements.  Evaluation  profiles  will  reflect  a  sampling  of  the  unit’s missions.  Evaluation tables are provided to summarize evaluation areas.  Areas common to all crew members are contained in Tables 2.1 and 4.1.  Instructor evaluation areas are in Table 3.1.  Evaluation areas unique to each crew position are located in their respective chapter.  Each crew specific chapter defines required events.  Evaluation methods are identified by notes in the crew specific tables and include:  in-flight only; in-flight and/or in simulator (see  Paragraph  1.9.1); and  in-flight  and/or  alternate  methods  (see  Paragraph  1.9.2).    For  areas  without  a  note,  flight examiners may evaluate at their discretion if observed.  If required events are not observed, then the evaluation is incomplete and will be accomplished on another flight.  (T-2) 1.9.1.  Simulator.    Weapon  System  Trainers  (WST)  with  a  C  or  greater  certification  (or Training  Value  Code)  of  3  or  greater  for  all  areas  evaluated  as  determined  by  Simulator Certification may be used to accomplish evaluations.  Simulator certifications will be located at the HQ AFSOC/A3T website. 1.9.1.1.  If  an  area/subarea  was  not  able  to  be  evaluated  in-flight,  and  the  event  is certified for evaluation purposes in the simulator, it can be evaluated in the simulator to complete  the  evaluation.    Document  in  the  comments  section  of  AF  Form  8/8a, Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification,  which  portion(s)  of  evaluation  were  conducted  in simulator. 1.9.2.  Alternate  Method.    When  it  is  impossible  to  evaluate  an  area  in-flight  due  to equipment  malfunctions,  operational  requirements,  scheduling  restrictions,  or  weather,  the area  may  be  evaluated  by  an  alternate  method  (i.e.,  procedural  trainer,  or  verbal examination).  If, in the flight examiner’s judgment, an item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight.   8  AFI11-2EC-130JV2  16 JUNE 2015 1.9.3.  Grading  Criteria.    To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  flight  examiners  will  use  the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades.  Exercise judgment when the wording of areas is subjective and when specific areas are not covered.  Flight examiner judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.  Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade. 1.9.3.1.  Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable aircraft.    In  some  cases,  momentary  deviations  are  allowable  provided  the  examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety. 1.10.  Unsatisfactory  Performance.  If  the  flight  examiner  observes  an  aircrew  counterpart jeopardizing  safety,  the  examiner  will  assume  the  duties  of  that  aircrew  member  (provided  the examiner’s Flight Duty Period (FDP) does not exceed AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules maximum FDP for an un-augmented crew).  This does not mean the examiner must assume the examinee’s position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed.  If the examiner feels the examinee  can  continue  safely  with  supervision,  the  examiner  is  not  required  to  assume  the examinee’s  duties.    However,  if  the  flight  examiner  assumes  the  examinee’s  duties,  assign  a Qualification Level 3 (Q-3) as the overall grade.  (T-2) must report 1.10.1.  Evaluators established procedures/directives in  any  area, regardless  of the individual’s crew specialty, to  squadron or  group  commander,  along  with  evaluator’s  recommendation  for  corrective  action,  IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and MAJCOM supplement.  (T-3) deviations/discrepancies from 1.11.  Additional  Training.  Flight  examiners  are  responsible  for  assigning  additional  training, at their discretion.  Document additional training and completion IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and MAJCOM supplement.  Any approved training device or medium may be used. 1.11.1.  Additional  training  may  be  accomplished  on  the  same  flight  as  the  evaluation, provided  the  unique  situation  presents  a  valuable  training  opportunity  (i.e.,  crosswind landings), and the discrepancy requiring the additional training will not result in overall Q-3 evaluation.    This  option  requires  flight  examiner  discretion  and  judicious  application.    The examinee must be informed when the additional training begins and ends. 1.12.  Rechecks.  Rechecks  will  normally  be  administered  by  a  flight  examiner  other  than  the one who administered the original evaluation. 1.13.  Special Qualifications.  Special qualification evaluations are administered for events that are not universal to all members in that crew position.  Special qualification evaluations may be conducted  separately  or  in  conjunction  with  the  qualification/mission  evaluations.    After qualification, areas can be graded as part of periodic Mission Evals.  There are no requisites for special qualification evaluations unless specified.  Refer to the appropriate crew position for any special qualification evaluation requirements. 1.13.1.  Special qualifications result in an AF Form 8/8a.  Document IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as SPOT evaluations.  Although a unit may maintain 100% of its crew members qualified, this documentation is still required due to interfly and permanent change of station issues. 1.14.  Multiple Qualification. 1.14.1.  Qualification Evaluation.  Aircrew maintaining qualification on any EC-130J aircraft does  not  require  an  additional  qualification  evaluation  on  any  C-130J  variant.    See AFI11-2EC-130JV2  16 JUNE 2015   9  AFI 112EC130J,  Vol  1,  EC-130J  Aircrew  Training,  (or  equivalent)  for  differences  training and currency requirements for multi-qualified aircrew. 1.14.2.  Mission  Evaluation.   Multi-qualified  aircrew  can  exercise  EC-130J  mission qualification  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  (TTP)  and  training  events  IAW  AFI-11-2EC-130J, Vol 1, (or equivalent) minus any restrictions on their AF Form 8 on any C-130J variant. 1.15.  Roles and Responsibilities. 1.15.1.  Refer to Paragraphs 1.4 through 1.14.   10  AFI11-2EC-130JV2  16 JUNE 2015 Chapter 2 ALL EVALUATIONS 2.1.  General.  The general grading criteria contained in this chapter applies to all crew positions and all evaluations.  The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform required duties  safely  and  effectively.    This  includes  appropriate  aircraft  systems  operation  IAW applicable  technical  order(s)  (TO),  instructions,  and  directives.    All  evaluation  requirements including grading criteria are Tier 2 requirements.  (T-2) 2.2.  Requirements.  Evaluate  all  crew  members  on  areas  listed  in  Table  2.1  and  applicable areas in Table 4.1 and tables defined for individual crew positions in subsequent chapters.  (T-2) 2.2.1.  Examinations.  All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations as a requisite to periodic evaluations IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and applicable supplements. 2.2.2.  Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE).  An EPE is a requisite for all Qualification (QUAL)  and  Mission  (MSN)  evaluations  except  special  mission  evaluations.    EPE  may  be conducted  verbally,  in-flight,  in  a  simulator,  or  by  another  method  determined  by  the examiner or unit Stan/Eval.  OGV may develop EPE guides for each crew position for flight examiner use.  EPE should be scenario driven, and tailored to the specific crew position.  The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee’s qualification and experience level.  Examiners should include other  general  knowledge  areas as well.  For mission evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and situations.  EPE will include sufficient in-flight and ground emergencies to evaluate the examinee’s knowledge of systems and procedures to the flight examiner’s satisfaction. 2.2.2.1.  Examinees  may  use  publications  that  are  normally  available  in-flight.    The examinee must recite all BOLDFACE items from memory and should provide the initial steps of emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the examiner, would not allow time for reference. 2.2.2.2.  Grading criteria for EPE are outlined in area 5 of General Grading Areas. 2.2.3.  Publications Check.  Required for all QUAL or combined QUAL/Mission evaluations as outlined in area 12 of General Grading Areas. 2.2.4.  Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management  (CRM).    In  accordance  with  AFI  11-290, Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management  Training  Program,  crew  resource  management  skills will  be  evaluated  during  initial  and  periodic  evaluations.    CRM  skills  are  integral  to  all phases  of  flight;  therefore,  no  specific  area  titled  CRM  exists.    CRM  skills  are  imbedded within  specific  grading  criteria  (mission  planning,  airmanship/situational  awareness,  crew coordination,  communication,  risk  management/decision  making,  task  management,  and briefing/debriefing)  and  include  all  of  the  skills  listed  on  the  AF  Form  4031,  CRM  Skills Criteria Training/ Evaluation Form.  Therefore, use of the AF Form 4031 is unnecessary for evaluations. 2.2.5.  Formal  Course  Evaluations.

Mission qualified CSO require a combined qualification and mission evaluation.  CSO  maintaining  only  basic  qualification  require  a  QUAL  flight  evaluation.    Instructors  will demonstrate instructor duties on all periodic evaluations.  (T-2) 6.2.  Requirements.  Evaluate all applicable  general  areas outlined in  Table  2.1 and  Table  4.1 on all evaluations.  Also, evaluate all instructors on areas in Table 3.1 on all evaluations.  CSO specific areas and criteria are listed in this chapter.  Open and closed book examinations boldface and an EPE  are requisites for periodic evaluations and are pre-requisites for initial  evaluations.  All  requirements  for  CSO  instructor,  qualification/mission  and  special  mission  evaluations  are Tier 2 requirements unless otherwise noted.  (T-2) 6.3.  Combined  Qualification/Mission.  In  addition  to  areas  listed  in  Tables  2.1,  3.1,  and  4.1, mission evaluations will include applicable  areas in  Table  6.1.  At a minimum  for airdrop and low-level evaluations, annotate the following on the AF Form 8 Section IV Comments:  the type of drop conducted, drop score, TOA/TOT, type of low-level flown.  (T-2) 6.3.1.  Initial/Requalification  (airland).    The  mission  profile  will  include  an  Infil/Exfil operation,  defensive  tactics/threat  avoidance  maneuver(s),  tactical  recovery/SCA,  and mission systems operations with the MCC and ECS crew positions on board and/or air-to-air refueling.    Mission  systems  operations  may  be  ground  evaluated  if  not  accomplished  in-flight.  TOT/TOA will be evaluated to one of the events above.  (T-2) 6.3.2.  Initial/Requalification  (airdrop).    Initial  qualification  evaluations  require  in-flight events including at least a 30 minute low-level timed to a tactical event and a threat reaction. A  tactical  event  is  considered  to  be  an  airdrop,  or  SCA.    Though  only  one  TOA/TOT  is required,  both  events  must  be  observed.    The  CSO  must  be  actively  directing  the  aircraft during the low-level. If the timed tactical event is a high-speed airdrop then a separate slow-speed  TOA/TOT  is  required.    In  that  case,  the  evaluator  will  determine  the  length  of  the additional low-level.  Mission systems operations with the MCC and ECS crew positions on board and/or AAR may be accomplished.  TOT/TOA will be evaluated to one of the events above.    Mission  systems  operations  will  be  ground  evaluated  if  not  accomplished  in-flight.  (T-2) 6.3.3.  Periodic.  Required in-flight events are the same as initial/requalification evaluations noted  above  with  the  following  exception:    The  TOA/TOT  may  be  timed  to  either  a  high-speed airdrop, or slow-speed event.  AAR will be ground evaluated if not accomplished in-flight. 6.4.  Special Mission Events. 6.4.1.  Air-To-Air Refueling .  Reference  Chapter  4 Common Grading areas for additional information.  (T-2) 6.4.2.  Initial/Requalification.    The  evaluation  profile  will  include  a  TOT  to  an  actual rendezvous and the execution of all checklists from Rendezvous thru Post Air-Refueling.  (T-2) AFI11-2EC-130JV2  16 JUNE 2015   49  6.4.2.1.  AAR  qualification  is  only  required  in  one  C-130  MDS.    Once  AAR  qualified, AAR  may  be  conducted  in  any  AAR  capable  C-130,  with  a  CSO  station,  in  which  the CSO is qualified/differences trained. 6.5.
