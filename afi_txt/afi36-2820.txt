Sitterly) Pages: 16 This  publication  implements  Air  Force  Policy  Directive  36-28,  Awards  and  Decorations Programs, and describes Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) awards presented to individuals and organizations in recognition of their outstanding service or contributions to the ISR  mission.    It  explains  award  eligibility,  nomination  criteria,  and  procedures  for  nomination and  winner  selection.    In  collaboration  with  the  Chief  of  Air  Force  Reserve  (AF/RE)  and  the Director  of  the  Air  National  Guard  (NGB/CF),  the  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Manpower, Personnel  and  Services  (AF/A1)  develops  personnel  policy  for  Air  Force  Awards  Decorations, and Special Recognition  Programs.   This  publication applies to  Regular  Component, Air Force Reserve  (AFR),  Air  National  Guard  (ANG),  and  Department  of  the  Air  Force  (AF)  Civilians.

This publication may be supplemented at any level, but all direct supplements are routed to the OPR of  this  publication  for  coordination  prior  to  certification  and  approval.    Major  Commands (MAJCOM)  need  to  provide  a  copy  to  the  OPR  upon  publication.    IAW  Air  Force  Instruction (AFI)  33-360,  Publication  and  Forms  Management,  the  authorities  to  waive  wing/unit  level requirements  in  this  publication  are  identified  with  a  Tier  (“T-0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3”)  number following the compliance statement.  Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. SUMMARY OF CHANGES This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.  This revision adds a new  category  specifically  to  address  ISR  accomplishments  while  deployed.    Additionally,  it eliminates the division of awards into multiple levels of competition, removes 25th AF from the process,  limits  award  nominations  to  a  maximum  of  16  lines  of  text  and  addresses  roles  and responsibilities.    The  routing  and  boarding  process  has  changed  for  some  Air  Reserve Component  (ARC)  elements.    Additionally,  it  includes  risk  factors  (known  as  “tiers”)  to  tasks assigned to organizations below MAJCOM level to depict the assessed risk of non-compliance. AFI36-2820  6 APRIL 2017 3 Chapter 1 OVERVIEW 1.1.  General.  The  AFISRAP  is  designed  to  recognize  outstanding  performance  across  the Intelligence disciplines and/or support to ISR missions and exceptional contributions to the field of support to Intelligence disciplines and/or ISR missions during the preceding calendar year (1 January  –  31  December).    This  program  enhances  existing  AF,  Organization,  and  Intelligence Community  recognition  programs.    All  individual  and  organization  packages  that  are  properly submitted and meet the eligibility criteria are considered. 1.2.  Wear  of  Award.  Military  Recipients  of  individual  awards  are  authorized  to  wear  the  AF Recognition Ribbon and civilian recipients are authorized to wear the AF Recognition lapel pin IAW AFI 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards. 1.3.  Award  Withdrawal.  The AF/A2 may  withdraw  an award after the  selection and prior to its  presentation  if  it  is  determined  that  actions  by  an  award  winner  have  discredited himself/herself  in  such  a  way  that  presentation  of  the  award  would  reflect  adversely  upon  the ISR career field and the AF. 4 AFI36-2820  6 APRIL 2017 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Organizational  Processes.  The  SIO  of  each  AF  MAJCOM,  FOA,  DoD  Joint  Agency, CCMD, and Combined Command establishes organization-specific procedures for selecting their organizational-level winners to compete as nominees at the AF/A2 level and sends nominations to the AF/A2F POCs for final boarding.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization nominations require the  endorsement  of  the  first  U.S.  O-6  in  the  nominee’s  chain  of  command.    All  Organization Award nominations require endorsement from the O-6 level or higher. 4.2.  Nominee  Limits.  The  SIO  of  each  AF  MAJCOM,  FOA,  DoD  Joint  Agency,  CCMD,  or Combined  Command  may  submit  no  more  than  one  nomination  for  each  award  category.    An individual may not be nominated for more than one award or category. 4.3.  Deployed  Members.  Submissions  for  a  member  deployed  for  365  days  fall  under  the deployed unit’s responsibility.   If members are tasked with  a temporary  duty or in  deployment status  of 6 months or longer, they  fall under the deployed unit’s responsibility.  Members on a TDY  or  deployment  status  tasked  for  6  months  or  less  during  that  award  period  fall  under  the responsibility of the home unit. 4.4.  Additional Guidance for ARC Personnel. 4.4.1.  AF  Reserve.    Reserve  Unit  Commanders  nominate  their  units  and  individual  unit members  to  the  Director  of  Intelligence  for  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC/A2).  AFRC/A2 boards unit members nominated against any AFRC/A2 staff members and submits organization-level  winners  as  nominees  to  AF/A2F  for  final  boarding.    Individual Mobilization  Augmentee  (IMA)  submissions  are  boarded  through  the  active  duty  chain  of command of the assigned MAJCOM. 4.4.2.  Air National Guard.  All ANG units and individual nominations are boarded through the  active  duty  chain  of  command  of  the  gaining  MAJCOM  with  exception  of  personnel assigned to National Guard Bureau A2 staff who are submitted directly to AF/A2F for final boarding. 4.4.3.  The  MAJCOM  SIO  boards  IMA  and  ANG  submissions  together  to  determine  the ARC nominee for each category and submits to AF/A2F for final boarding. 4.5.  Award Package Submission. 4.5.1.  Suspense.    For  competition  at  the  AF/A2  level,  Command/Agency  POCs  email packages on either NIPR, SIPR or JWICS to the AF/A2F POC not later than the last Friday in  February.    Each  MAJCOM,  FOA,  DoD  Joint  Agency,  CCMD,  or  Combined  Command sets their own suspense for packages competing below the AF-Level. 4.5.2.  Memo of Transmittal.  Each Command/Agency POC submits one memo to cover the entire set of nomination packages per example in Attachment 2.  This memo confirms that all military  nominees  meet  AF  standards  and  all  civilian  nominees  have  maintained  a “successful” rating on the performance appraisals during the award period.  Additionally, the memo needs to state all packages have been through a security review to verify information submitted adheres to the appropriate level of classification marking, if necessary.  This memo 10 AFI36-2820  6 APRIL 2017 identifies  which  system  (NIPR,  SIPR  or  JWICS)  each  AF  Form  1206  is  being  submitted through  (as  reflected  in  Attachment  2).    If  all  nominations  are  sent  via  one  system,  an overall statement may be made on the Memo of Transmittal instead of identifying a system per nomination. 4.5.3.  Nomination  Form.    Award  nominations  are  submitted  on  an  AF  Form  1206, Nomination for Award.  The Award field, on the top of the AF Form 1206 needs to reflect the award name as outlined in this AFI.  In the Name field include the nominee’s military status, i.e., RegAF, Reserve, Guard and/or IMA.  Limit the award nomination narrative to 16 typed, single spaced lines only, to include the heading "Outstanding Leadership and Performance" for  all  individual  awards  and  “Outstanding  Unit  Performance”  for  unit  awards.    Use  bullet format  with  12-pitch,  Times  New  Roman  font  regardless  if  classification  markings  exist,  if applicable.    Reference  award  criteria  for  the  description  of  each  award  in  this  AFI  (do  not include  community  service  and  professional  military  or  other  education  accomplishments).  Use  of  acronyms  is  permitted.    All  acronyms  need  to  be  spelled  out  on  the  AF  Form  1206 continuation page. 4.5.3.1.  Classified Packages.  Nominations may be classified up to TS/SI/TK.  Collateral classified  packages  need  to  follow  proper  classification  guidelines  IAW  DoDM  5200.1, Information  Security  Program  and  AFI  16-1404,  Air  Force  Information  Security Program.    SCI  packages  must  follow  the  appropriate  guidelines  provided  in  DoDM 5105.21-V1,  Department  of  Defense  Sensitive  Compartmented Information Administrative  Security  Manual  and  Intelligence  Community  Directive  (ICD)  710, Classification and Control Markings System (T-0).  All classified nomination forms (AF Form 1206) need to  have an overall classification marking at  the top  and bottom  of the specific accomplishments section, along with typed portion markings at the beginning of each bulleted line showing the classification of each bulleted line (T-0). 4.5.3.2.  Each AF Form 1206 needs to be submitted as a separate file using the following naming  convention:  AWARD_CATEGORY_  LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_MAJCOM.                          EXAMPLE:  REGAF_NCO _DOE_JANE_USAFE. AFI36-2820  6 APRIL 2017 11 Chapter 5 SELECTION PROCESS 5.1.  Board  Process.  AF/A2  convenes  three  virtual  boards  in  the  spring  of  each  year  to  select AF-Level winners from submissions.

The  board  selects  a winner from all individual officer and civilian categories.  This board also selects a nominee from  the  organizational  award  packages  for  each  unit  award  as  well  as  a  RegAF  and  ARC nominee to compete for the Major General Jack E. Thomas, NMIA Award. 5.1.2.  Enlisted  board  is  chaired  by  the  ISR  CFM  and  comprised  of  four  additional  Chief Master  Sergeants  (three  RegAF  and  one  ARC).    The  board  selects  a  winner  from  all individual  enlisted  categories.    The  board  also  selects  a  nominee  from  the  unit  award packages  for  each  unit  award  and  an  RegAF  and  ARC  nominee  to  compete  for  the  Major General Jack E. Thomas, NMIA Award. 5.1.3.  Combined  board  is  chaired  by  the  14N  CFM  and  reflects  ISR  officer  and  enlisted representation.  The board reviews nominations from the Officer/Civilian and Enlisted boards and  selects  winners  for  each  Organization  Award  category  and  the  Major  General  Jack  E. Thomas, NMIA Award. 5.2.  Winner Announcement.  The AF/A2 announces winners to all command A2s and the ISR CFM  announces  to  all  command  A2  Chief  Enlisted  Managers  through  email  no  later  than  the first  Friday  in  April  each  year.
