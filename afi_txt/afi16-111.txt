Program Definition.  The USAFA C-SEAP is designed to respond to Air Force requirements for  foreign  language  proficient  officer  personnel  to  protect  US  global  interests  and  meet  our responsibilities.    In-country  language  and  cultural  immersion  programs  are  the  most  successful approaches  to  producing  language  fluency.    Such  programs,  conducted  at  a  foreign  military academy, have the added benefit of educating USAFA cadets on the forces of friendly nations.  At  the  same  time,  the  program  affords  international  cadets  from  foreign  academies  an opportunity for a brief period of study at USAFA furthers engagement and cooperation between air forces and provides strong, mutually beneficial educational dividends for both academies. 2.  Program Description.  The C-SEAP entails a one-for-one reciprocal exchange of cadets, for one  USAFA  academic  semester  (approximately  4  1/2  months),  between  USAFA  and  a  foreign military  academy  during  the  same  fiscal  year.    During  the  exchange,  visiting  cadets  are  fully integrated  into  the  academic,  military,  athletic,  and  social  life  of  the  host  academy.    The academic curriculum of the proposed military service academies must be comparable to  ensure participating  cadets  receive  academic  credit  for  attendance  at  the  host  service  academy.    All support  provided  to  visiting  cadets  under  this  program  will  be  on  a  reciprocal  basis.    Cadet exchanges  will  be  conducted  pursuant  to  a  memorandum  of  agreement  (MOA)  between  the participating military services. 3.  Responsibilities. 3.1.  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  International  Affairs,  Security  Assistance  Policy  and Education  and  Training  Division  (SAF/IAPX)  will  provide  guidance  and  administrative oversight of the C-SEAP and will serve as the overall focal point for C-SEAP matters. 3.2.
