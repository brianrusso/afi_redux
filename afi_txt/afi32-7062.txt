Comprehensive  Planning  establishes  a  systematic  framework  for  informing decision-making  on  the  physical  development  of  Air  Force  installations  and  their  environs.    It provides  an  integrated  context  and  advocacy  for  the  multiple  Air  Force  processes  that  support and sustain current and future missions.  It relies on active Air Force stakeholder participation in the  development  of  a  sustainable  plan  and  promotes  compliance  with  applicable  federal,  state, and local laws, regulations, and policies. 2.2.  Comprehensive  Planning  Foundations.  The following concepts  should be applied when conducting Comprehensive Planning: 2.2.1.  Planning  Districts  (PD).  Installations  are  divided  into  identifiable  PDs  based  on geographical  features,  land  use  patterns,  building  types,  and/or  transportation  networks (Community Center, Airfield, Warehousing, etc.). 2.2.2.  Sustainable  Planning.  The  concepts  and  principles  of  sustainable  planning  are incorporated into all installation development planning and infrastructure projects.  The goal is  to  satisfy  mission  requirements  while  maintaining  a  safe,  healthy,  and  high  quality environment  for  current  and  future  generations.    Key  principles  of  sustainable  planning include: 2.2.2.1.  Compact  Development.  Installations  work  to  conserve  land  resources.    This can be achieved through compact  development  patterns that support an appropriate mix of uses, encourage walking and other alternative modes of transportation, accommodate appropriate residential and commercial densities, and incorporate a more integrated grid network of streets and sidewalks.  Installations may have to reconfigure current land use patterns  and  transportation  systems  within  their  developed  areas  to  create  opportunities for  future  development.    Compact  development  patterns  may  include  multi-story buildings,  greater  densities,  mixed-uses,  and  minimal  spacing  between  buildings  while maintaining  consideration  of  Antiterrorism/Force  Protection  (AT)  requirements,  Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) impacts, and other constraints. 2.2.2.2.  Infill  Development.  To  conserve  limited  land  resources,  planners,  to  the maximum  extent  possible,  plan  development  within  the  installation  core  (existing cantonment area) and on previously developed land.  Planners should place buildings in gaps between existing developed areas and buildings.  Such infill development results in greater density at  the core of the installation and supports more integrated land use  and transportation  networks.    Removal/replacement  of  aging  low-density  development  with higher density development may also be appropriate. 2.2.2.3.  Mixed-Uses.  To  make  compact  development  feasible,  compatible  uses  should be  integrated  into  horizontal  and  vertical  mixed-use  development.    Incompatible  land uses are appropriately segregated. AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015   9  2.2.2.4.  Transportation  Networks.  Ensure that uses within each district as well as the districts themselves are connected via a network of streets and pedestrian pathways based on  modified  grid  patterns  that  afford  route  options  for  motor  vehicles,  bicycles,  and pedestrians. 2.2.2.5.  Landscape Development.  Integrate regionally-appropriate native or indigenous vegetation and inert materials across the installation to conserve water resources, control erosion, increase aesthetics, reduce heat  island  effects,  utilize storm  water, and mitigate antiterrorism  concerns  where  practical.    Effectively  incorporate  landscape  materials  to improve  the  human  experience  through  increased  recreational  opportunities  and encouraging walking and bicycle use while mitigating impacts to air quality and facility energy consumption. 2.2.2.6.  Low Impact Development.  Use on-site natural features to control storm water runoff  quantity  and  quality  in  lieu  of  traditional  “end-of-pipe”  solutions.    Implement engineered  small-scale  hydrologic  controls  to  replicate  the  pre-development  hydrologic regime  of  watersheds  through  infiltrating,  filtering,  storing,  evaporating,  and  detaining runoff close to its source. 2.2.2.7.  Energy  Efficiency.  Include  opportunities  for  production  of  renewable  energy and  use  of  nuclear  energy,  improvement  of  energy  security,  energy  conservation,  and enhancement of energy efficiency.  Identified opportunities should reduce dependence on energy from outside sources and enhance energy security. 2.2.2.8.  Natural  &  Cultural  Resource  Conservation.  Consider  installation  cultural and  natural  resources  to  ensure  protection  of  these  resources,  including  appropriate information and maps from the Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP) and the Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan (ICRMP).  Consultation and the development of enduring relationships with cultural entities is a significant component of cultural resource stewardship. 2.2.2.9.  Antiterrorism  (AT).  Planning incorporates provisions for AT per UFC 4-010-01, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings. 2.3.  The  Environmental  Impact  Analysis  Process.  Planners  shall  alert  the  EIAP  Program Manager  as  early  in  the  planning  process  as  possible  to  initiate  requirements  of  the  National Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA).    Planning  activities  must  integrate  the  NEPA  processes  to ensure that planning and decisions reflect environmental values, identify alternatives considered, document  which  alternatives  would  be  carried  forward  for  full  analysis  including  the  rationale for  those  dismissed  and  to  avoid  delays  later  in  the  process  avoiding  potential  conflicts. Additionally,  EIAP  supports  the  formulation  of  strategies  to  avoid  or  mitigate  adverse environmental impacts.  Planners can better implement the IDP by reaching out to stakeholders and decision makers associated with the environmental analysis process.   10  AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 3 THE COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING PROCESS 3.1.  Objective.  The  objective  of  the  Comprehensive  Planning  Process  (CPP)  is  to  synthesize data and information to  enable  commanders to  make effective development decisions  affecting their installation and the surrounding community.  CPP is a multidisciplinary process involving all stakeholders associated with management, use and development of Air Force lands, facilities, and  resources.    CPP  includes  analysis  of  the  installation’s  development  capability  to  perform current,  programmed,  and  potential  future  missions.      The  summary  product  of  the  CPP  is  the IDP.    The  IDP  provides  a  developmental  path  forward  that  incorporates  known  and  projected mission requirements, developmental constraints and opportunities, and recommended courses of action  to  achieve  optimal  use  of  lands,  facilities,  and  resources  in  support  of  installation performance.  The  IDP  also synthesizes the results of relevant studies, analyses, and functional plans prepared by members of the cross-functional planning team. 3.2.  Process steps.  The CPP takes place at all levels and includes five main steps: 3.2.1.  Identification.  The  installation  mission  is  the  most  important  element  affecting  the future direction of base development.  Assigned missions dictate functional requirements and the physical layout of the installation.  Planners need to understand the mission and its effect on  land,  facilities,  built  and  natural  infrastructure,  and  the  way  of  life  of  the  installation community.    Within  the  Identification  step,  the  BCP  identifies  shortfalls  in  the  existing capability, capacity, or relationship of installation resources with respect to their contribution to successful accomplishment of installation missions. 3.2.2.  Evaluation.  The BCP assesses the information collected in the first step, and relate it to  relevant  installation  development  opportunities  and  constraints.    The  evaluation  process also further quantifies the deficiencies highlighted in the Identification step. 3.2.3.  Development.  IDP  development  occurs  when  preliminary  (mission,  installation, environmental,  etc.)  and  projected  (future  mission  plans,  off  base  encroachment  projection models,  vegetation  growth,  etc.)  information  is  collected,  assessed,  and  development alternatives are shaped.   Plan development is “top down” with the IDP  prepared first, then area development plans, then site specific plans. implementation through is  accomplished 3.2.4.  Implementation.  IDP improvement projects.    The plan identifies projects necessary  to  meet  mission requirements and  execute the  plan’s  vision,  goals  and  objectives.    These  projects  become  the  foundation  for  the installation  Capital  Improvements  Plan  (CIP).    Funding  constraints  typically  inhibit simultaneous funding of all projects  in  the CIP.   This  fosters long-range, deliberate,  capital investment  decision  making.    An  installation’s  physical  development  evolves  at  a  pace necessary to meet mission needs;  yet accommodates responses to short-term problems such as swing space for renovations or construction project completion. 3.2.5.  Maintenance.  After  an  IDP  is  developed  and  approved,  it  should  remain  useful, current, and relevant to the installation’s mission.  This is achieved during annual review and validation  or  when  major  development  changes  are  proposed.    U.S.  national  security  and defense reviews may impact military posture, force structure, and installation configuration, AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015   11  and  any  of  these  strategic  drivers  can  impact  installation  requirements.    Comprehensive planning is a continuous process. 3.3.  Relationship  to  Other  Major  Processes.  Comprehensive Planning is an integral element in  resource  allocation  (such  as  strategic  basing,  requirements,  acquisition,  programming, environmental and budgeting).  The CPP requires data from other processes as inputs.  Likewise, outputs from the CPP are used as process inputs elsewhere in informing leadership on planning actions and resource allocation.  The following are basic processes and process outputs integral to comprehensive planning, but do not represent an all-inclusive list: 3.3.1.  Component  Plans.  The  comprehensive  planning  process  evaluates  and  balances  a spectrum of issues: environmental, land use, operational, engineering, transportation, safety, security,  design,  and  quality  of  life  that  determine  the  installation’s  future  physical development.  These issues are addressed in component plans, studies, databases, documents, and  graphics  required  to  be  prepared  and  maintained  by  the  BCP  and  other  functional experts.  Examples include Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Study, Integrated  Natural Resources  Management  Plan,  Housing  Community  Profile,  Privatized  Housing  Initial Development  Plans,  Dormitory  Master  Plans,  Integrated  Cultural  Resources  Management Plan,  Architectural  Compatibility  Plan,  Encroachment  Action  Plan,  Investment  Planning (AMPs,  BCAMPs),  and  Traffic  Engineering  Studies.    Elements  of  component  plans  and special  studies  are  generally  used  in  preparing  the  IDP.    All  of  these  component  plans  and special  studies  may  not  be  appropriate  or  desirable  for  all  installations.    Other  specialized component plans or special studies may also be desirable and necessary.  When relevant, all of the cited plans, and others as appropriate, are evaluated with respect to the IDP.  Planned resource  stewardship  actions,  opportunities  and  constraints  within  each  program  are evaluated with respect to the others to identify potential impacts on future development. 3.3.2.  Investment  Planning.  The  CIP  identifies  development  actions  needed  to  support current and projected mission activities.  As the Investment Planning process proceeds from the longer-range Program  Objective Memorandum  view, to  the budget  cycle, and finally to current-year execution, changes in anticipated and actual resource allocation can impact the IDP  when  proposed  projects  are  or  are  not  funded  in  the  years  where  need  has  been identified.  These changes, in addition to the insertion of unanticipated requirements resulting from  near-term  mission  changes  and/or  other  legislation  or  regulatory  change,  can  drive changes in proposed project scope or timing.  Consequently, the IDP is evaluated in terms of these  factors,  and  the  investment  plan  may  in  turn  need  to  be  revised  to  reflect  changing priorities  and  fiscal  constraints.    Figure  3.1  below  reflects  the  interaction  of  the Comprehensive Planning and Investment Planning processes.   12  AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015 Figure 3.1.  IDP/Investment Planning Integration.  3.3.3.  Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP).  The Air Force has established the EIAP to ensure the potential environmental impacts of Air Force actions are considered and inform decision-making processes.  Planners coordinate with the installation EPF for analysis of planning proposals for environmental effects.  The two key elements in the EIAP are (1) early identification of proposed actions and (2) completion of the entire EIAP process before decisions  are  made.    EIAP  embodies  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  NEPA  process  with emphasis  on  environmental  awareness,  sustainable  development,  historic  preservation  and protection of archeological and natural resources.  The proponent is responsible for initiating the AF Form 813 by completing Section 1 and submitting it to the EPF. The EPF conducts the EIAP for projects within its capacity.  For EIAP actions that exceed installation capacity, the  AFCEC  NEPA  Center  of  Excellence  serves  as  the  EPF.    For  overseas  installations, DODD 6050.7, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Department of Defense Actions, and 32 CFR §989, Part 187 apply. 3.3.4.  Encroachment  Management.  Encroachment  is  any  deliberate  action  by  any governmental  or  non-governmental  entity  or  individual  that  does,  or  is  likely  to,  inhibit, curtail,  or  impede  current  or  future  military  activities  within  the  installation  complex  or mission footprint; or deliberate military activity that is, or is likely to be, incompatible with the community’s use of its resources and reasonable quality of life.  Identified encroachment requires evaluation in terms of how it impacts current installation layout and operation, and constrains  future  development.    Proposed  military  and  community  development  actions  are evaluated  with  respect  to  how  the  development  mitigates  or  conflicts  with  known  or projected encroachment. IDPs consider encroachment with regard to recommended planning AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015   13  actions to ensure proposed development actions are consistent with encroachment prevention objectives. 3.3.5.  Explosive  Safety.  Proposed facilities that are intended for the storage, maintenance, processing, and handling of explosives, to include facilities and roadways to be constructed within  explosives  safety  clear  zones  as  defined  in  AFMAN  91-201,  Explosives  Safety Standards, require special siting.  These facilities require approval from the appropriate Air Force  and  DOD  level  before  expending  funds  on  any  construction  activity.    Proposed development  actions  require  evaluation  to  ensure  they  do  not  conflict  with  existing  or planned explosives-related facilities and their required separation distances. 3.3.6.  Infrastructure  Planning.  Address  all  infrastructure  systems  (to  include  utility delivery and conveyance systems and all base pavements to include roadways, taxiways, and runways) and infrastructure investments to provide an overview of the state of these systems throughout  the  installation.    Emphasis  is  placed  on  capacity  analysis,  systems  details,  age, location, and condition of facilities, and location of facilities with a clear and understandable graphic  presentation.  This  macro  view  of  these  detailed  engineering  infrastructure  systems provides  the  decision-maker  with  the  information  necessary  to  clearly  comprehend  the linkages  between  these  critical  engineering  systems  and  the  capability  to  support development  identified  in  the  other  component  plans.    Infrastructure  planning  should  also addresses  communications  systems  and  navigational  aids  as  they  affect  development opportunities. 3.3.7.  Interagency  Planning  Coordination.  Many  Federal,  State,  regional,  and  local agencies have established planning processes that would benefit from Air Force participation, and  whose  input  would  in  turn  benefit  Air  Force  installation  planning.    Planning  issues arising from encroachment, noise, population growth and transportation are examples of the need for direct Air Force participation in external planning processes.  It is important that Air Force  installations  develop  reciprocal  planning  relationships  that  help  ensure  such discussions on a continuing basis.  A proactive inter-governmental planning process provides an integrative planning framework that can respond to both Air Force mission  requirements and  local  planning  actions.    Air  Force  representatives  attending  local,  state,  and  regional planning  groups  should  contact  their  Public  Affairs  and  Staff  Judge  Advocate  offices  for consultation prior to commenting on official Air Force positions regarding projects occurring outside of the installation complex or mission footprint. 3.3.8.  Installation  Emergency  Management  Plan  (IEMP)  coordination.  AFI  10-2501, Air  Force  Emergency  Management  Program,  describes  the  Installation  Emergency Management Planning process.  The IEMP provides comprehensive guidance for emergency response to physical threats resulting from major accidents, natural disasters, severe weather events,  conventional  attacks,  terrorist  attacks,  or  Chemical/Biological/Radiological/Nuclear attacks.  It is important  for the BCP to maintain situational awareness of and coordinate on the IEMP.   14  AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 4 COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING REQUIREMENTS 4.1.  The  Installation  Development  Plan  Format.  The IDP summarizes the results of the Air Force Comprehensive Planning Process at a given point in time.  It provides the strategic goals and  supporting  geospatial  and  written  information  to  advocate  for  resources  through  project programming, evaluate energy initiatives, provide documentation on encroachment issues on and off  the  installation,  promote  airfield  safety,  and  enhance  the  general  health  and  welfare  of  the natural  and  built  environment.    The  BCP  will  ensure  the  IDP  contains,  at  a  minimum,  the following sections:  (T-2).  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7. Commander’s Cover Letter.

The  BCP  will  ensure  the  IDP  is  reviewed  and  updated annually,  or  as  needed  if  conditions  change  before  the  annual  review.    (T-2).  The  BCP  will ensure  the  IDP  is  briefed  to  the  installation  Facilities  Board  and  endorsed  by  the  Wing Commander  annually.    (T-2).  The  BCP  will  forward  all  major  changes  to  the  IDP  from  the installation to the MAJCOM before the IDP can be revised.  (T-2). (Major changes are defined as the  insertion  or  deletion  of  a  Military  Construction  (MILCON)  requirement  within  the  Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), re-siting of a MILCON project, or other threshold event as defined in  MAJCOM  supplemental  guidance.)  The  BCP  will  ensure  new  IDPs  and  major  changes  to existing IDPs are briefed to the MAJCOM as part of a Base-to-Command briefing, or forwarded for approval by the MAJCOM or as delegated not later than 30 April of each calendar year. (T-2). MAJCOM will develop MAJCOM specific guidance for the IDP approval process. 4.4.  Plan  Evaluation.  The  aggregate  effect  of  the  projects  proposed  in  the  IDP  should  be evaluated with  respect  to  how the projects  enable progress  toward the objectives established in Federal, Defense, Air Force, MAJCOM and installation policy and guidance in Chapter 2.  The Sustainability  Development  Indicators  (SDI)  provided  in  Attachment  3  illustrate  many installation performance measures that can help the BCP identify and quantify this progress, as well  as  the  source  of  the  data.    With  this  information,  the  BCP  will  then  include  a  Plan Achievement Matrix in the IDP, explicitly identifying the plan’s contribution to progress against key objectives as defined by AFCEC. (T-2).   16  AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015 4.5.  Plan  Maintenance.  Routine updates and maintenance of the IDP are the responsibility of the  BCP.    Resourcing  for  significant  studies  or  component  plan  development  outside  the capability  of  the  BCP  is  programmed  and  funded  by  the  BCE.    When  the  need  for  specific studies  or  analyses  is  driven  by  a  new  weapon  system  beddown  or  by  a  mission  change  for  a tenant  organization,  the  weapon  system  or  tenant  chain  of  command  may  need  to  program  for and fund the requirement. AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015   17  Chapter 5 GEOSPATIAL MAPPING 5.1.  Definition.  Geospatial Mapping is the spatial data component of comprehensive planning, and refers to the compilation and consolidation of spatial data to create maps to support planning decisions.      AFI  32-10112,  Installation  Geospatial  Information  and  Services,  defines  the mapping  requirements  for  the  common  installation  picture  and  the  data  layers.    Spatial  data collected  and  created  while  doing  comprehensive  planning  requires  adherence  to  the  specified common standards. 5.2.  Data  Layers  (DL).  DLs  are  necessary  in  order  to  perform  analysis  of  development constraints  and  opportunities  across  the  installation  and  within  PDs.    Data  for  current  and proposed  mission  requirements  are  used  to  establish  limitations  and  conditions  affecting  an installation’s capabilities to execute mission support. 5.2.1.  Origination.  Many  DLs  necessary  for  comprehensive  planning  are  created  by multiple external agencies.  The comprehensive planning process and the IDP integrate and analyze  these  data  layers  to  build  situational  awareness  of  the  installation  and  its  regional setting.  Attachment 2 lists the basic DLs required for preparing the IDP. 5.2.2.  Data  Maintenance.  Data stewards will review DLs on no less than an annual basis, and revise when necessary. (T-2). Data stewards will coordinate DL updates with their Geo-Integration Office.  (T-2) 5.3.  Information  Security.  To  address  information  security  concerns,  installation  security managers will review the IDP for suitability for public release. (T-2). The IDP is intended to be releasable  to  outside  contractors  and  other  external  agencies  as  required  to  facilitate  planning, coordination, mutual aid, and future construction.  DLs deemed to be classified at the SECRET level or higher should not be included in the IDP.  Access to DLs classified as For Official Use Only (FOUO) or Sensitive but Unclassified should be restricted to individuals having appropriate need  to  know.  Installation  security  managers  have  the  authority  to  withhold  the  release  of  any information, as the situation dictates.   18  AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 6 QUALIFICATIONS, TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 6.1.  Qualifications.  The BCP position requires knowledge, skills, and abilities in the practice of comprehensive  planning  and  successful  completion  of  a  full  4-year  course  of  study  from  an accredited college or university leading to a bachelor's or higher degree in a major appropriate to the  community  planning  field.    The  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC)  will  ensure  that qualified personnel are appointed as BCPs, as well as adherence to all of the Office of Personnel Management  standards  for  this  profession.  (T-1).  Commanders  will  ensure  these  qualified personnel perform the installation comprehensive planning function. (T-2) 6.2.  Training. 6.2.1.  Installation  Development  Plan  Training.  Upon  initial  appointment,  BCPs  shall  be scheduled  to  attend  the  next  available  offering  of  the  Air  Force  Institute  of  Technology (AFIT) educational course Comprehensive Planning Development (WENG-520). (T-2) 6.2.2.  Continuing  Education.  BCPs  are  strongly  encouraged  to  attend  related  AFIT courses as a part of a formal Individual Development Plan.  Suggested AFIT coursework in asset management and sustainability, such as WMGT 101, WMGT 416, WMGT 420, WENV 450, and WMGT 580 is highly recommended. 6.2.3.  Training  Plan.  Proficiency  in  the  practice  of  comprehensive  planning  is  vital  to representing Air Force interests before community and regional agencies.  BCPs work with supervisors  to  develop  and  implement  training  plans  to  maintain  proficiency  in  the  tactics, techniques  and  procedures  of  contemporary  comprehensive  planning.    The  training  plan should  indicate  continuing  education  opportunities  to  include  workshops,  seminars  and courses  conducted by  DOD, Air  Force, national, regional, or state associations, educational institutions,  or  other  organizations  affiliated  with  city/comprehensive  planning.    BCP proficiency training includes the recurring Air Force Planners Training Workshop conducted by  AFCEC.    The  Training  Plan  may  also  incorporate  cross-training  and  broadening experiences such as participation in the Assistance Team program.  JOHN B.

U.S.C.—United States Code VMT—Vehicle Miles of Travel Terms Area Development Plan—This plan elaborates on the proposed development of a specific area. It illustrates the functional as well as physical and human aspects of areas to be developed. This plan  may  be  short  range  but  could  show  proposed  long-range  (10-15  yr.)  physical  changes.  It generally includes roadways, pedestrian paths, parking, utility alignments, landscaping, cost and schedule  information,  etc.  Common  applications  are  the  community  center,  flight  line, administration complexes, etc. Air  Installation  Compatible  Use  Zone—This  program  is  designed  to  assist  local,  regional, state, and federal officials in protecting and promoting the public health, safety, and welfare by promoting  compatible  development  within  the  AICUZ  area  of  influence.  The  AICUZ  program also protects Air Force operational capability from the effects of land use which are incompatible with aircraft operations. techniques Activity  Management  Plan—A  plan  developed  for  an  activity  that  uses  multi-disciplinary management engineering,  planning,  programming, environmental, IT, risk management, and administration) over the lifecycles of the assets (when built  assets  are  involved)  and  applies  them,  in  the  most  cost  effective  manner,  to  achieve specified Air Force levels of service.

Base-to-Command  Briefing—Refers  to  management  oversight  procedure  and  protocols  for MAJCOMs  to  review  and  approve  installation  planning  programs  and  products  to  include  the Installation Development Plan. Capital  Improvements  Plan—Integrates  all  the  primary  elements  of  traditional  physical planning,  current  land  use,  vicinity  land  use,  existing  base  layout  and  facilities,  existing transportation systems, and each of the corresponding future plans into one document. Land use and  transportation  significantly  influence  development  of  the  CIP.  The  CIP  identifies  in  more detail  the  physical  location  of  projects  approved  for  funding  or  programmed  for  funding.    The CIP  integrates  MILCON;  Operations  and  Maintenance  (O&M);  Military  Family  Housing (MFH);  Non-Appropriated  Funds  (NAF);  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR)  programs; industrially-funded depot maintenance; and other source-funded projects that significantly affect facilities  and  land  development.    All  CIP  projects  should  reflect  in  their  appropriate  AMP,  but only key development projects should be included in the CIP. Component  Plan—A  separate  plan  or  special  study  required  by  other  Air  Force  programs focusing  on  functional  areas  that  support  the  Installation  Development  Plan  and  the  overall comprehensive  planning  effort.  Preparation  of  Component  Plans  is  not  specifically  required  by this  instruction.  Component  Plan  information  is  incorporated  into  the  Installation  Development Plan at an appropriate level of detail. Comprehensive Planning Process—The ongoing, iterative, participatory process addressing the full range of issues affecting or affected by an installation's development. Through this process, goals  and  objectives  are  defined,  issues  are  identified,  information  is  gathered,  alternative solutions are developed, and a sound decision-making process is employed to select a preferred alternative for implementation. Current  Planning—This  phase  covers  active  construction  programs,  extending  approximately one year into the future. This phase can be viewed as the implementation phase, where the Long-Range  and  Short-Range  Plans  are  translated  into  physical  development.  While  the  information will  be  the  most  detailed  available,  the  opportunity  to  accommodate  changes  becomes  limited and potentially costly. Data  Set—A  defined,  documented,  and  approved  set  of  Data  Layers  which  can  be  used  in conjunction with separately maintained business data to complete a recurring task or mission. A Mission Data Set is created in order to provide a standardized data model and consistent process for  mapping  and  analysis.    The  Data  Layers  within  a  Mission  Data  Set  can  be  obtained  from across multiple, different functional  groupings. The Data  Layers within a Mission Data Set  are selected based on relevance to a specific mission. Each Mission Data Set will address potential conflicts  arising  from  the  interaction  of  the  composite  Data  Layers,  to  include  topology, symbology  and  vocabulary.  An  example  of  a  Mission  Data  Set  is  the  Common  Installation Picture (CIP). Digital  Electronic  Data  and  Systems—Examples  include  Geographic  Information  Systems (GIS),  Computer  Aided  Design  and  Drafting  (CADD),  Automated  Facility  Mapping  (AF/FM), Computer  Aided  Facility  Management  (CAFM),  Multimedia  (MM),  databases,  spreadsheets, AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015   25  graphic  interfaces,  and  other  distributed  multimedia  systems  such  as  the  Internet  and  World Wide  Web  (WWW).  These  tools  are  used  in  managing,  manipulating,  and  maintaining comprehensive planning information. Encroachment—Any  deliberate  action  by  any  governmental  or  non-governmental  entity  or individual that does, or is likely to, inhibit, curtail, or impede current or future military activities within the Installation Complex or Mission Footprint,; or deliberate military activity that is, or is likely  to  be,  incompatible  with  the  community’s  use  of  its  resources  and  reasonable  quality  of life. Environmental  Impact  Analysis  Process  (EIAP)—  The  process  required  by  the  National Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969  (NEPA);  the  implementing  regulations  of  the  President’s Council  on  Environmental  Quality  (CEQ)  in  40  CFR  Parts  1500  -  1508;  and  Air  Force implementing regulations contained in 32 CFR Part 989. The NEPA established the CEQ and a national  policy designed to  encourage consideration  of the influences of  human activities (e.g., population  growth,  high-density  urbanization, the  natural environment. The CEQ implementing regulations established procedures requiring, among other things,  that  environmental  information  about  major  federal  actions  with  the  potential  to significantly impact the environment be made available to the public before decisions are made and  that  federal  agencies  promulgate  their  own  regulations  to  ensure  those  procedures  are followed. The Air Force EIAP regulations establish the procedural framework to implement the legal  requirements  of  NEPA  and  the  CEQ’s  implementing  regulations.  In  short,  EIAP  ensures that impacts of proposed Air Force actions are analyzed and considered in the decision-making process, and before any final decision or irretrievable commitment of resources is made. industrial  development)  on Installation  Complex—The  land,  facilities,  airspace,  and  ranges  providing  direct  mission support  to  and/or  are  managed  by  the  installation.    This  includes  a  combination  of  land  and facilities comprised of a main installation and its noncontiguous properties (auxiliary air fields, annexes, and missile fields) that provide direct support to, or are supported by, that installation.  Installation complexes may comprise two or more properties, e.g., a major installation, a minor installation, or a support site, each with its associated annex(es) or support property(ies). Installation  Development  Plan—The  document  that  provides  the  installation  commander  and other decision-makers  a  condensed picture of an  installation's capability to support the mission with  its  physical  assets  and  delivery  systems.  It  is  a  general  assessment  of  the  installation’s infrastructure and attributes for the purpose of gauging development potential. Integrated Priority List—A list of requirements falling within a specific funding category, and prioritized within each fiscal year. Investment  Planning—The process of using AF strategic drivers, AF mission objectives/needs and installation requirements along with defined levels of service to develop requirements across the  FYDP+2  that  informs  the  POM;  and  to  develop  and  prioritize  projects/opportunities  for implementation in the CY+1 budget. Long-Range  Planning—The planning phase that offers the widest view and the broadest level of detail. This planning phase typically covers a period extending to 20 years in the future. It is the  most  dynamic  phase  where  the  greatest  amount  of  change  can  be  introduced  and  absorbed with the least expense. Long-Range planning is accomplished through requirements analysis, and the development of future land use and transportation plans.   26  AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015 Map—A  graphic  representation,  usually  on  a  plane  surface,  and  at  an  established  scale,  of natural  or  built  features  on  the  earth  surface,  that  generally  encompasses  the  installation, surrounding  area,  and  region.  The  features  are  positioned  relative  to  a  coordinate  reference system.  Maps  in  most  cases  will  be  computer  generated.  Maps  support  the  Installation Development Plan, Component Plans, Special Plans and Studies. Mission  Footprint—The  installation  complex  plus  any  land,  facilities,  airspace,  or  ranges  that are not managed by the installation, but provide direct, routine support to the mission. Plan  Achievement  Matrix—A  summary  table  or  spreadsheet  showing  CIP-proposed  projects aligned with major planning objectives provided within HAF, MAJCOM, and Installation vision and guidance materials. Planning District—A subdivision of an installation, greater in scope than an Area Development Plan, discerned by defining characteristics such as geography, mission, land use, building types, that  entail  a  unifying  theme  for  focused  analysis  on  mission,  command  priorities,  and  facility requirements. Short-Range  Planning—The  planning  phase  which  coincides  with  the  lead  time  for  facility construction  programs,  generally  extending  5  years  into  the  future.  It  is  at  this  phase  that planning decisions are integrated with the appropriate construction and funding programs. Site Plan—A site plan is a detailed plan for a specific project. It shows the relevant natural and built  features  of  the  site,  including  precise  locations  of  buildings,  parking  areas,  driveways, landscaping,  fencing,  walkways,  signs,  lights,  etc.  The  site  plan  is  a  graphic  representation  of exactly  what  a  site  would  look  like  when  complete.  Site  plans  are  usually  completed  in  a  pre-construction design phase. Special Plans and Studies—A source of planning information on a functional area required by a specific Air Force program. Examples include Housing Community Profiles, Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans, Air Quality Studies, and Transportation Studies. Sustainable  Installation—An  installation  that  efficiently  supports  current  operations  with minimal impact on the built and natural environments without compromising the ability to meet future mission requirements.  AFI32-7062  18 DECEMBER 2015   27  Attachment 2 GEOSPATIAL VISUALIZATION A2.1.  Intent.  The  Installation  Development  Plan  aligns  geospatial  information  from  a  wide variety of sources in order to depict the installation as it currently exists, define constraints and opportunities, and illustrate future development plans. A2.1.1.  The following table highlights the majority of geospatial Mission Data Sets and Data Layers that are central to installation planning efforts.  Refer to the Comprehensive Planning Playbook for current  definition of relevant  planning-related data.   Installation  planners may identify  other  information  that  is  relevant  and  required  to  fully  define  the  situation  at  their bases, and should coordinate with the responsible data steward for access to current versions of that information. A2.1.2.  Various communities continue to expand their geospatial data libraries, and to define standards for the representation of their geospatial data layers.  Refer to the appropriate Geo-Integration  Office  or  AFI  32-10112,  Installation  Geospatial  Information  and  Services,  for more information on geospatial data. A2.1.3.  The  following  table  identifies  data  sets  and  layers  as  either  “Internal”  (I)  or “External”  (E)  in  terms  of  whether  they  are  generated  within  the  comprehensive  planning process  (internal),  or  are  developed  within  other  processes  and  serve  as  source  information for the comprehensive planning process (external).  For external data, the table also identifies the organizational elements within the host Wing that likely produce and maintain these data, although  assigned  responsibilities  may  vary.    The  data  sets  and  layers  listed  within  each category may be supplemented with additional information as required. Table A2.1.  Geospatial Data. Data Set  I/E Data Steward Detail A.

SDIs establish the existing installation sustainability profile for the IDP.  The SDIs can also be used as measurement and predictive tools to assess the impacts of planning actions.  The SDIs represent quantitative values and are used in conjunction with other quantitative and qualitative information used to inform the planning process.  The SDI comprise planning ratios, e.g. Use/Sq. Ft, Use/Per Capita, and qualitative description, e.g. professional assessment, in nine sustainability categories:  Air Quality, Energy Use, Water (Quality & Quantity), Encroachment, Land Use, Waste Reduction-Non Hazardous,  Renewable Energy, Space Optimization and Natural/Cultural resource areas, and include inside and outside-the-fence Indicators.  These categories are mandatory elements of the Installation Development Plan.  Table 3.1 below shows those required categories along with a list of suggested measures and data sources.  The list of measures and sources is not all inclusive.  Other measures and sources may be used where applicable. Table A3.1.  Sustainability Development Indicators & Data Sources.
