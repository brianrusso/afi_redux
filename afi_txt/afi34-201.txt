NAFIs below HQ USAF level created after 1 Oct 1988 must have a charter ( Attachment 3)signed by the official who authorized the NAFI, for example, the MAJCOM commander.  Thisauthority is called the chartering authority.3.1.3.1.  In the chartering authority letter, include:3.1.3.1.1.  The proposed purpose of the NAFI.3.1.3.1.2.  A clear justification of how the NAFI was necessary to meet Air Force programobjectives.3.1.3.1.3.  Types of functional activities the NAFI will conduct.3.1.3.1.4.  Successor NAFI ( paragraph 3.3.).3.1.3.1.5.  A financial plan to operate the supported activities.NOTE: NAFIs established before or initially established as a result of implementation of the installationMWR fund concept or Air Force reorganization/restructure is not affected by this paragraph's require-ment, but disestablishment is according to this instruction.3.1.4.  Each NAFI's official title must be standard.  Prefix NAFI titles by the applicable command,base, or isolated unit's official name; for example, Air Combat Command MWR Fund and RandolphAir Force Base MWR Fund.AFI34-201   17 JUNE 2002153.2.  Categorizing NAFIs and Activities. (See AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Wel-fare, and Recreation Programs and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, for categories of NAFIs andactivities.)  Categorize NAFIs and activities to:3.2.1.  Ensure uniformity and standardization.3.2.2.  Promote an understanding of the relationships of NAFIs to the activities they support.3.2.3.  Identify how much appropriated fund (APF) support may be authorized for MWR activitieswithin each category.3.3.  Successor NAFIs. Establish NAFIs through the successive delegation of authority through com-mand channels.  Each NAFI has a successor NAFI at either base, MAJCOM, or HQ USAF level.  Theyensure responsive, responsible and solvent NAFI financial administration.3.3.1.  A successor NAFI:3.3.1.1.  Provides the initial assets to establish a new subordinate NAFI. Identifies the successorNAFI in each new NAFI's charter.3.3.1.2.  Acts on requests from its subordinate organizations for support or assistance.3.3.1.3.

The Air Force Lodging Fund (AFLF) is the successor NAFI for MAJCOM lodging funds.The AFLF pays severance at closing bases when there aren't enough funds in residual assets or theMAJCOM lodging fund is insolvent.  The MAJCOM lodging fund acts as successor for base lodg-ing funds within the command.3.3.2.3.  The MAJCOM MWR fund is the successor NAFI for the MAJCOM's base MWR fundsand any other base NAFIs under the purview of the AFMWRAB, except for lodging funds, civil-ian welfare funds, and base restaurants.  The MAJCOM MWR fund is also the successor NAFI forStars and Stripes (where applicable) and isolated unit MWR funds.  EXCEPTION: If the isolatedunit fund is funded by a base MWR fund, the base MWR fund is the successor NAFI.3.3.3.  Specify any deviation from successor relationships identified in this instruction in the charterand get prior approval from Chairman, Finance and Audit Committee, AFMWRAB.16Section 3B—Types of NAFIs.AFI34-201   17 JUNE 20023.4.  Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) NAFs. APFs, NAFs, and a combination of APFs andNAFs fund MWR programs and facilities, depending on their nature.3.4.1.  The custodian determines whether MWR or other authorized programs proposed for NAFfunding fit the criteria for support stated in this instruction.  Sources of funds include:3.4.1.1.  Air Force AAFES dividends paid monthly to installation and MAJCOM MWR funds.Distribution to bases is a percentage of local AAFES exchange sales.  MAJCOMs receive anamount equal to a percentage of what their bases receive.  HQ USAF/SV establishes the percent-age amounts.  Chapter 11 covers locations where no AAFES exchange facilities exist.3.4.1.2.  Local fees and charges, membership dues, and proceeds from the sale of merchandise andservices from MWR activities.  This income remains at the generating base to support MWR pro-grams and activities.3.4.1.3.  Contributions and donations.3.4.1.4.  Income from other sources, including concessionaire-operated activities.3.5.  Command, Base, and Unit-level MWR NAFIs.3.5.1.  Command-level MWR Funds.

AFI 34-209 describes the NAF cost center code (CCC) to use in reportingNAF income and expenses associated with authorized MWR programs and services.3.5.3.1.  If a proposed program is not covered by an existing CCC, submit a brief description of theprogram through the MAJCOM and HQ AFSVA/SVF to HQ USAF/SV for review.3.5.3.2.  HQ USAF/SV assigns the proper APF support category and CCC, evaluates its impact oninsurance coverage and premiums, and provides additional guidance on how to conduct the newprogram.3.5.4.  Isolated Unit Funds (IUF). Unit-level MWR funds are authorized for active Air Force andAFRES units that are designated as isolated.  The Air Force MWR or AFRES MWR Fund providessupport to Air National Guard (ANG) units.  Income and expenditures are the same as for installationMWR funds.  (See Chapter 11.)3.6.  Command Lodging Funds. Each MAJCOM has a command lodging fund.  It allows the use ofcommand-wide resources for needed base lodging improvements (see AFI 34-601, Air Force LodgingProgram).3.6.1.  Don't invest base-level lodging funds.  The command lodging fund has the only savingsaccount for lodging funds in the command.  It receives all interest earned, including that on the CMIPdemand deposits.3.6.2.  Each base-level lodging fund maintains CMIP deposits to cover normal operating expenses.  Ifthe MAJCOM determines it necessary, it may move excess funds to the command lodging fund tofund capital expenditures or provide operating capital for needy bases.  Grants are the normal sourceof funds for capital expenditures or for operating capital at needy bases.3.7.  Base Lodging NAFIs. Each base establishes a lodging NAFI with the approval of the MAJCOM.3.7.1.  Activities within a base lodging NAFI operate on a self-sustaining basis as indicated by thelodging fund profit and loss statement.  This operation focuses on achieving the financial indicatorsestablished by HQ USAF/SV for the lodging NAFI.  Set daily service charge rates according to AFI34-601.3.7.2.  Small lodging activities (maximum of 15 rooms) may be satellites of another base's lodgingNAFI when approved by HQ AFSVA/CC.  Small lodging activities established before 1 Feb 1991 cur-rently being operated under an MWR fund are "grandfathered."3.7.3.  Transfer lodging funds (through the command lodging fund) from one base lodging fund toanother within the command to help needy bases and improve lodging services.3.7.4.  Establish temporary lodging facility (TLF) charges to provide enough cash to pay the assess-ment, cover operating expenses, and provide for capital requirements or improvements.  Do not gen-erate any extra cash.3.8.  Air Force Fisher Houses (Special NAFIs). Fisher Houses provide temporary lodging for familiesof patients who are hospitalized for complicated or critical medical problems.18AFI34-201   17 JUNE 20023.8.1.  NAFs provide support to Fisher Houses through supplemental mission support NAFIs thatoperate as TLFs.  Treat them as you would TLFs and lodging funds.  The base lodging fund is the suc-cessor NAFI for Fisher Houses. Services supports the operation by providing accounting and contract-ing services .3.8.1.1.  User fees, donations and gifts (with appropriate approvals), and APFs support FisherHouses, as authorized.  Services supports the operation by providing both accounting and con-tracting services through the NAF AO.3.8.2.  The installation commander administers the NAFI.  Overall responsibility for operations restswith Medical Treatment Facility commander.3.8.3.  The Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) commander initiates the request for the special NAFIcharter.  Overall responsibility for the operation rests with the MTF commander.  The MTF com-mander is a voting member of the base NAFs Council at locations with Fisher Houses.3.9.  Commandants' School Mission Support Funds (CSMSFs). CSMSFs provide services for stu-dents and faculty of Air Force schools and aid in military career education and training.  Use these NAFsto directly contribute to the schools' missions.3.9.1.  "Commandant" is the head of an Air Force school, commander of a training center or base, orSuperintendent, USAFA.  MAJCOMs identify the commandants.3.9.2.  MAJCOM/CC approves the establishment or dissolution of such NAFIs at base level.3.9.3.  Identify CSMSFs by the official school and base designation; for example,  Commandant'sSchool Mission Support Fund, USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Air Force Materiel Command,Brooks AFB TX 78235-5000.3.9.4.  Authorized expenses in support of the school's mission are:3.9.4.1.  Cost-conscious development or improvement of training and educational materials.3.9.4.2.  Payments to civilian and retired military speakers and lecturers participating in officialschool functions and contributing to the curriculum.3.9.4.3.

Keep expenditures conservative and limit expenditures to the same kinds of pur-chases authorized from special morale and welfare funds (SM&W) (see Chapter 12).3.9.4.4.  Awards for instructor and student incentive programs associated with the school's mis-sion.3.9.5.  The MAJCOM MWRF is the successor NAFI for command CSMSFs.3.10.  United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Athletic Association and Cadet Dining HallFunds. The Superintendent, USAFA, directly controls, operates, and supervises these NAFIs.  They arenot part of the Air Force MWR Program for purposes of APF reporting and other limitations.3.11.  HQ USAF Special Fund (Pentagon). This NAFI receives income from the DoD ConcessionCommittee.  Its income supports the SAF and HQ USAF Welfare and Recreation Activities.AFI34-201   17 JUNE 2002Section 3C—Dissolving NAFIs3.12.  Basic Procedures.193.12.1.

Use NAFs for other purposes only as permitted in this and otherAFIs.  Do not use NAFs for any purpose unless such use is allowed in the general authorization above orelsewhere in this or other AFIs.  The absence of a prohibition on a specific use of NAFs does not providethe authority to use NAFs.4.1.1.  Don't use NAFs for purchases requiring interest payments (other than those required by law) orcarrying charges to non-Government entities.4.1.2.  When APFs are not available, the commander may approve the conservative use of NAFs forpaying dues or fees in professional, scientific, or technical societies and associations for personnelwho act as Air Force liaison to those organizations.

Use NAFs to support an MWR sponsored coupon program to promote participation in MWRactivities.  The Services squadron commander or director approves and sets the value of all MWRcoupons.  Control coupons according to AFI 34-202.4.1.4.  Use NAFs for promotional mailings including postage when related to the sale of merchandiseand services (see paragraph 9.4.).4.1.5.  The use of NAFs to pay registration fees is the same as for APFs (see AFI 65-601V1, US AirForce Budget Policies and Procedures).4.1.6.  When APFs are authorized, use NAFs to purchase equipment for MWR activities only in anemergency. The installation commander certifies and identifies the emergency in writing andapproves waivers to use NAFs instead of APFs for the purchase.4.1.7.  (Added)  When NAF capital expenditures of more than one million dollars are being plannedfor Category C activities, the Public-Private Venture (PPV) alternative must be considered as pre-scribed in AFI 64-301, Nonappropriated Fund Contracting Policy, paragraph 8.  Before accomplishingan economic analysis consider the effect of the potential PPVon the benefit or mission involved andthe impact on authorized patrons, the MWR program, and the local community. Where an economicanalysis is required to determine best value for the Air Force, refer to the economic analysis programson the HQ AFSVA web site at http://www-r.afsva.af.mil (under Financial Management).  Any PPVcontract/agreement requires prior written approval from HQ USAF/ILV.4.2.  What NAFs Don't Cover. Do not use NAFs for:4.2.1.

Tax Payments.8.1.1.  NAFIs must collect, report, and pay all Federal taxes required by law.  Send tax paymentchecks when due to the designated tax collector.8.1.2.  Report disputes involving taxes to AFLSA/JACL (see AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation).  Forwarda copy to HQ AFSVA/SVL.8.2.  Federal Taxes.8.2.1.  The Director of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sets regulations for withholding, deposit-ing, paying, and reporting Federal taxes. For general tax guidance on income and Federal InsuranceContributions Act taxes, see IRS Circular E and AFI 34-209.8.2.2.  In the United States, NAFIs that sell alcoholic beverages or beer must have the appropriateoccupational tax stamp as a wholesale beer dealer, retail beer dealer, wholesale liquor dealer, or retailliquor dealer (see AFI 34-119).8.3.  State and Local Taxes.8.3.1.  As instrumentalities of the United States, NAFIs have the same immunity from state and localtaxes as the rest of the Federal Government. However, procedures for withholding and paying NAFemployees' state and local income taxes must conform to the policy applicable to APF employees ofthe Air Force at the same location.8.3.2.  On any other tax questions involving non-Federal taxing authorities, NAFI custodians consulttheir local servicing JA office.8.4.  Applying State and Local Taxes to Petty Cash Purchases.8.4.1.  The NAF AO obtains an opinion from its servicing JA office on whether local vendors maycharge amounts covering state and local tax on NAFI petty cash purchases.  Such charges are permis-sible when the legal incidence of the taxes does not fall on the purchasing NAFI.8.4.2.  Where the amounts covering state and local taxes are legally charged to the purchasing NAFI,the purchasing individual pays them and is reimbursed for the amounts paid.8.4.3.  Where the amounts covering state and local taxes can't be legally charged to the purchasingNAFI (that is, when the legal incidence of the tax falls on the purchasing NAFI), the followingrequirements apply:8.4.3.1.  The individual making the NAF purchase tells the vendor that the purchase is for an AirForce NAFI and asks that it be tax-free.  If the item costs more than a nominal amount ($25), theindividual normally must provide the vendor with a certification from the servicing JA office orthe NAF AO that:8.4.3.1.1.  The purchasing NAFI is an instrumentality of the United States.34AFI34-201   17 JUNE 20028.4.3.1.2.  It is exempt from state and local taxes.  Get the certification from the servicing JAoffice or the NAF AO.8.4.3.2.  If the vendor insists on charging the taxes, then the purchaser should consider going else-where.  If the vendor is the only source for the item or good judgment indicates that the amountinvolved doesn't justify the effort of going elsewhere, go ahead and make the purchase.  NAFs willreimburse the full amount.8.5.  Interest and Penalty Payments. As a general rule, one Federal agency may not assess interest andpenalties against another, except where specifically authorized by law.8.5.1.  NAFIs must pay interest and penalty assessments under Federal law where the amounts arepayable to an individual rather than to the Government.  Examples are the interest and penalties paidto a claimant that are required under the NAF Workers' Compensation Program by the Longshore andHarbor Workers' Compensation Act.8.5.2.  Before payment, the servicing JA office reviews any interest or penalty charges assessedagainst a NAFI by another Federal agency or instrumentality.  The servicing JA office or HQ AFSVA/SVL can help you respond to the Federal agency.8.6.  Taxes Levied by Foreign Governments. NAFIs usually are exempt from foreign duties and taxes,either by the express provisions of an international agreement or by recognition that they are United Statesinstrumentalities.  Report any attempted taxation by foreign countries or their political subdivisions toAFSLA/JACL as required by AFI 51-301.  Send a copy to HQ AFSVA/SVL.8.7.  Collecting Taxes for Foreign Governments. NAFIs have no authority to collect taxes for a foreigngovernment unless the United States has consented to do so by international agreement.8.8.  Tax Reporting for Personal Services Contracts, Awards, Bingo, and Prizes. NAFIs report theamount paid to any individual when it exceeds a specified dollar amount.  See AFI 34-209 for accountingprocedures.  The guidance in this paragraph applies to personal services contracts, awards, bingo, andprizes.8.8.1.  The NAFI reports NAF personal services contracts, including contracts with entertainers, thatadd up to $600 or more during a calendar year. Report to the IRS on IRS Form 1099 MISC.8.8.2.  A NAFI must report to the IRS any person who receives cash, prizes, or awards from a NAFIfor contests, including sporting events and commercial sponsorship, that total $600 or more in any cal-endar year.  Winnings include the fair market value of payment in any form other than cash (for exam-ple, a car, golf cart, television, golf clubs).8.8.3.  A NAFI must report to the IRS any person who receives a payment of $1,200 or more from onebingo game.  Determine the value of such winnings as follows:8.8.3.1.  Don't subtract the selling price of one or more bingo cards for that game from the amountof the winnings.8.8.3.2.  Total all the individual's winnings from one bingo game. If the winner uses two or morecards in the same game or receives other payments on a bingo card while playing one game, theindividual could be a multiple winner in that one game.AFI34-201   17 JUNE 2002358.8.3.3.  Don't include winnings and losses from any other games the winner played; for example,winnings on preceding or succeeding games do not accumulate for reporting purposes.36AFI34-201   17 JUNE 2002Chapter 9 SPECIAL USES OF NAFS9.1.  Trophies and Awards. The guidance in this paragraph applies when you purchase trophies andawards with NAFs.  Awards involving any form of NAFI profit-sharing are prohibited.  Expenditures aremade only when:- APFs aren't authorized.- The activities or programs aren't mission-related.- This chapter authorizes the use of NAFs.9.1.1.  Use NAFs to purchase trophies and awards for:9.1.1.1.  Competitive excellence in specified activities and programs.9.1.1.2.  Individual recognition of achievements authorized by Air Force instructions.9.1.2.  Use MWR NAFs for:9.1.2.1.  Trophies, plaques, US savings bonds, property, and cash awards for recreational compet-itive contests and events that are:9.1.2.1.1.  Officially announced in advance.9.1.2.1.2.  Conducted within a stated period.9.1.2.1.3.  Open equally to all eligible people and organizations that the NAFI supports.9.1.2.2.  For volunteers in the Family Services program and the MWR program.9.1.2.3.

For individual recognition programs when approved by the commander according toChapter 12.9.1.3.2.  For NAF employee incentive award and recognition programs.9.1.3.3.  For NAF employees participating in the NAFI suggestion program (see AFI 34-301).9.1.4.  Use CSMSFs for awards for instructor and student incentive programs associated with theschool's mission.9.1.5.  To ensure a consistent awards program:9.1.5.1.  Make the award commensurate with the achievement or accomplishment.9.1.5.2.  Make sure accomplishment and competition awards are officially established,announced, and (usually) of a continuing nature.  Give awards annually, unless you wish to honora unique accomplishment or when more frequent awards would clearly benefit the program.9.1.5.3.  Set processing, evaluation, and award procedures to minimize administrative or tempo-rary duty (TDY) costs or both.AFI34-201   17 JUNE 2002379.1.5.4.  Limit the number of trophies, plaques, useful property awards, and similar items, as nec-essary.9.1.6.  The Services squadron commander or director annually reviews all award programs anddecides whether they warrant continuation, as part of the NAF budget process.9.1.7.  The support group commander approves limits on cash or merchandise awards for sports andrecreational events. For such events:9.1.7.1.  Publicize all events to attract as many participants as possible and avoid preferential treat-ment for a select few.9.1.7.2.  Award only accomplishments achieved in sanctioned play, tournaments, or events ratherthan open, free, or unsupervised activities.9.1.7.3.  Evaluate the cost of each award against the value of awards from sponsoring associationsthat recognize the same kind of accomplishment (for example, an American Bowling Congressaward for bowling a 300 game).9.1.7.4.  Require competitors to acknowledge, in writing, that they understand that accepting cashprizes could void their amateur status.9.1.7.5.  Be prepared to give alternative awards, such as plaques, to those who decline cash.  (SeeChapter 8 for payment of taxes and other AFI 34-series instructions for any further limitations onawards for sport competitions.)9.1.8.  In addition to cash or property, awards may include coupons for rounds of golf, lines of bowl-ing, or free use of other MWR activities.  The Services squadron commander approves such awards.9.2.  Travel and Transportation.9.2.1.  Temporary duty (TDY) travel with APFs is authorized for a NAF employee when an authorizedDoD official directs the travel and it is related to business supported by APFs.  Publish special ordersfor travel as required by AFI 37-128, Administrative Orders (PA).9.2.2.  The NAFI directing the travel pays for the travel expenses of NAF officials or employees trav-eling on NAF business; that is, the internal operations of the NAFI (as opposed to supervisory func-tions that are official Government business).9.2.2.1.  Never use NAFs for travel to functions that the NAFI doesn't support.  For example, don'tuse lodging funds for travel to a conference on family housing.9.2.3.  All NAF employees traveling to an installation on official APF or NAF TDY travel ordersshould reserve lodging with the applicable base lodging activity whenever possible.  NAF employeesmust get a DD Form 1351-5, Government Quarters and Mess, or an assignment to contract quartersif they can't get lodging reservations.  Otherwise they won't get paid for the quarters portions of theper diem or actual expense allowance.9.2.4.  Use APFs to transport NAF property (see AFI 65-106).9.2.5.  Regular NAF employees selected for permanent change of station (PCS) transfer to a NAFI atanother Air Force installation are allowed essential travel and transportation according to AFI 34-301.38AFI34-201   17 JUNE 20029.2.6.  An individual traveling at NAF expense who receives a bonus coupon, a tangible article (forexample, clock, radio, bag, golf balls), trading stamp discount document, or another ticket, turns theitems in to the NAF AO or NAFI custodian.  The traveler gets a receipt for the item.9.2.6.1.  Travelers may enroll in "frequent flyers" or other mileage-accumulation programs to getfree or discounted travel or airline seat upgrades that ultimately accrue to the NAFI.  In addition,coupons, discount tickets, and other benefits help defray the cost of future NAF travel.9.2.6.2.  Tangible items go to an appropriate MWR activity for use by authorized participants.9.2.6.3.  Inventory accountability depends on the value of the item and its useful life (see AFI34-209).  When tangible items are received for APF travel, account for them according to AFI34-209.9.2.7.  Use NAFs to buy scheduled commercial airline tickets and recreational tourism services.9.2.7.1.

A military organization of one service that occupies facilities on an installation under thejurisdiction of another service.  (See DoDD 1015.1 for guidance on providing MWR fund benefitsto tenant organizations of another service.)11.1.1.2.  An Air Force organization of one MAJCOM or FOA located on or attached to an AirForce installation under the jurisdiction of another MAJCOM.11.1.2.  The host is one of two entities:11.1.2.1.  The MAJCOM that has jurisdiction over the installation or other real property that thetenant occupies.11.1.2.2.  The organization that the host MAJCOM or HQ USAF designates to furnish tenant sup-port.11.1.3.  Host commanders oversee all aspects of MWR operations.  They provide the same MWR ser-vices and benefits for tenants as for comparable organizations in their commands.11.1.4.  A MAJCOM/SV may help meet unique requirements of an organization tenanted on facilitiesof another command when the parent command considers it necessary.11.2.  Isolated Units.11.2.1.  An isolated unit is an organization that meets both of these criteria:- Isn't located on a military installation with MWR programs or isn't located within 15 miles of suchan installation.- Does not receive an AAFES dividend distribution.11.2.1.1.  Isolated units may also include:11.2.1.1.1.  Security groups, recruiting, communication, or weather detachments.11.2.1.1.2.  Military training groups at colleges and universities.11.2.1.1.3.  Radar squadrons.11.2.1.1.4.  Military advisory assistance groups operating in locations without NAF assistance(see AFI 16-104, Attache Affairs).11.3.  Getting MWR Support for Isolated Units. When a unit is within 15 miles of a military installa-tion with MWR programs, the unit receives its MWR support from that military installation.11.3.1.  Stipulate in a support agreement with the installation that the installation will:11.3.1.1.  Provide access to installation MWR facilities and services.11.3.1.2.  Allow the isolated unit full participation in MWR programs.AFI34-201   17 JUNE 20024311.3.1.3.  Provide other support as established by the installation commander.11.3.2.  Report problems in obtaining needed support through command channels for resolution.11.3.3.  On-the-spot assistance on MWR matters is available to smaller units that can't employ person-nel or are not authorized assigned personnel for MWR programs.11.4.  Establishing an Isolated Unit.11.4.1.  An isolated unit may establish a support agreement with any Air Force installation within a15-mile radius, regardless of whether other military installations may be closer.11.4.2.  An isolated unit may establish an agreement for MWR support with only one military instal-lation at a time.11.4.3.  Include intra-command support in the support agreement.11.4.3.1.  The MAJCOM/SVF negotiates such agreements and gets approval from the host-tenantMAJCOM.  The MAJCOM/SVF approves a memorandum of understanding (MOU), includingthe intra-command support provided.11.4.3.2.  The isolated unit fund (IUF) custodian keeps a copy of the MOU in the Life-of-the-Fundfile.11.4.4.  Isolated units are not necessarily entitled to host base MWR funds for unit parties and picnics.11.4.4.1.  Installations may choose to provide such support (see paragraph 4.3.4.).11.4.4.2.  Don't use any NAF source to provide supplemental funding for unit parties and picnicswhen local installation MWR programs do not include such support.11.4.5.  HQ AFSVA provides funding annually for Defense Attache Offices based on estimated mili-tary strength and adjusted to actual expenses at the end of the fiscal year.11.4.6.  Establish an isolated unit as an isolated unit fund when the unit's revenues exceed, or areexpected to exceed, $36,500 per year.  The isolated unit fund is subject to all regulations, reporting,and other requirements of MWR funds.11.5.  Determining MWR Support for Isolated Units.11.5.1.  Isolated Unit Report (RCS:HAF-SV [A&Q] 9469). Annually, by 1 October (with data as of1 August), each MAJCOM/SV sends HQ AFSVA/SVF a listing of its isolated units.  This report isdesignated emergency status code C3.  Continue reporting during emergency conditions, delayed pre-cedence.  Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to allow the submission ofhigher precedence reports.  During emergency conditions, submit by nonelectronic means, if possible.Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE.  This report includes:- The unit name and location.- Military strength by branch of service.- Name and distance from closest military installation.- Location Personal Accounting Symbol (PAS) code.- Any additional MWR support a unit receives.44AFI34-201   17 JUNE 200211.5.1.1.  Units with more than 100 military personnel provide this report by the first day of eachquarter with data as of 2 months prior.11.5.2.  HQ AFSVA/SVF provides funding to each MAJCOM, for support of its isolated units annu-ally or quarterly (as reported in paragraph 11.5.1.), at a per capita rate that HQ USAF/SV establishes.11.5.2.1.  To determine the equivalent full-time strength of ANG and Reserve units, multiply theirauthorized strength by 5 percent and apply the per capita funding formula to the result.11.6.  Accounting for MWR Disbursements to Isolated Units.11.6.1.  The MAJCOM accounts for MAJCOM or base (if the MAJCOM assigns support responsibil-ity to a base) disbursements to isolated units. Accounting is in accordance with AFI 34-209.11.6.2.  The allocating NAFI transfers NAFs for ANG units to the United States Property and FiscalOfficer (USPFO) for the state involved.  Allocated NAFs remain assets of the allocating NAFI untilthey are actually expended.11.6.2.1.  The USPFO establishes a single bank account (checking or savings) for these NAFs.11.6.3.  Do not commingle NAFs with any other type of funds (state, Federal, private, or other).11.6.3.1.  If more than one NAFI allocates funds (for example, if the state has ANG units sup-ported by more than one MAJCOM or base), the NAFs that the USPFO receives may be commin-gled, but they must be accounted for in such a way that allocations from a supporting NAFI areused for ANG units entitled to support from that NAFI.11.6.3.2.  The USPFO disburses NAFs to support ANG units as needed.  Use of these NAFs isaccording to the provisions of this AFI.11.7.  Disbursing Funds to Isolated Units.11.7.1.  MAJCOMs provide support to their units at intervals that the MAJCOM establishes.11.7.2.  A MAJCOM/SV may designate a base MWR fund within the command to provide MWRfund support to an isolated unit.11.7.3.  An isolated unit fund may act as a consolidated NAFI to account for the funds of other iso-lated units that the same MAJCOM or base MWR fund supports.  The fund may include other MAJ-COM or other military service units by agreement.11.7.4.  A MAJCOM/SV may provide MWR funds to the parent organization to use for a group of iso-lated units or detachments.11.7.5.  If funds provided to a MAJCOM for a unit are not disbursed to the unit, the MAJCOM returnsthe funds to the AFMWRF.11.7.5.1.  Annually, each MAJCOM reports funds disbursed to their units.11.7.5.2.  HQ AFSVA determines the amount, if any, the MAJCOM must return to the AFMWRF.11.7.6.  Provide additional MWR funds to isolated units from command funds, if the parent commandthinks it necessary.AFI34-201   17 JUNE 200245Chapter 12 SUPPORT FOR SPECIAL MORALE AND WELFARE (SM&W) PURPOSES12.1.

Include command-level expenditures in quarterly reports.46AFI34-201   17 JUNE 200212.2.2.2.  A HQ AFSVA representative periodically visits MAJCOMs to evaluate their manage-ment of the SM&W program.  This representative provides a written report of findings to theMAJCOM/SV for resolution with the command section.12.2.2.3.  MAJCOMs must respond to the finding in writing, indicating what corrective actionsthey're taking.12.2.3.  Host commanders have an obligation to fulfill the SM&W requirements for their unit com-manders, tenant unit commanders on their bases, and off-base unit commanders for which they haveMWRF support responsibility. Requests for SM&W funds follow the format at Attachment 6.12.2.4.  The commander decides what SM&W needs will be met and closely scrutinizes each expen-diture to avoid criticism or embarrassment to the Air Force.  Initially forward all requests for SM&Wexpenditures to FM for funding from APFs (see AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds):12.2.4.1.  If FM certifies that representation funds are not authorized, you may submit a request touse NAFs for an authorized SM&W expenditure.12.2.4.2.  If APF representation funds are authorized but not available, don't use NAFs for theSM&W expenditures.12.2.5.  Commanders must exercise restraint in using SM&W funds for purposes described in thischapter so that basic MWR programs and services are not deprived of the NAF resources required toensure their effectiveness.  The authorization for SM&W expenditures does not constitute a com-mander's fund in any sense.12.3.  MWR Fund Custodian Responsibilities.12.3.1.  The custodian:12.3.1.1.

It complements a change to AFI 64-301, Nonappropriated Fund Contracting Policy (IC 99-1, 13 May 99).  Paragraph 4.1.7. is added to identify the new requirement and provide a vehicle for conducting any economic analysis required.4.1.7.  When NAF capital expenditures of more than one million dollars are being planned for Category C activities, the Public-Private Venture (PPV) alternative must be considered as prescribed in AFI 64-301, Nonappropriated Fund Contracting Policy, paragraph 8.  Before accomplishing an economic analysis con-sider the effect of the potential PPVon the benefit or mission involved and the impact on authorized patrons, the MWR program, and the local community. Where an economic analysis is required to deter-mine best value for the Air Force, refer to the economic analysis programs on the HQ AFSVA web site at http://www-r.afsva.af.mil (under Financial Management).  Any PPV contract/agreement requires prior written approval from HQ USAF/ILV.AFI34-201   17 JUNE 200271Attachment 8 IC 2002-1 TO AFI 34-201, USE OF NONAPPROPRIATED FUNDS (NAFS)17 JUNE 2002 SUMMARY OF REVISIONS: This change expands the Special Morale and Welfare (SM&W) expenditure authority to provide memen-tos to the spouses of awardees, promoted individuals, and retirees, and mementos for guests of honor at memorialization (naming a street, building, etc.) functions.
