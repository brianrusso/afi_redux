HQ  AF/A4C  will  annually  recognize Civil  Engineer  organizations  and  personnel  for  outstanding  achievement  after  HQ  AF/A4 announces the winners and runner-ups. See Attachment 2 for a complete list of awards. 2.2.  General Nominating Procedures. 2.2.1.  Joint Basing: AF members of a Joint Base (JB) that are under AF lead qualify for all awards listed in this Instruction.  AF military members of a JB that are under Army or Navy lead  will  qualify  for  unit  and  individual  awards  listed  in  this  instruction  if  the  eligibility criteria  listed  for  the  awards  are  met.    However,  units  and  individuals  nominated  for  lead Service awards should not be nominated for like AF awards. 2.2.2.  Contractors are not eligible for individual or team awards pertaining to this AFI.  (T-1). 2.2.3.  Submit nomination packages on AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award, according to the directions outlined in the published award criteria unless otherwise specified. 2.2.3.1.  Nominations  exceeding  page  and  line  limitations,  or  not  following  subject headings  as  described  under  criteria  requirements,  will  not  be  considered  in  the  award competition.  Use  bullet  statements  to  show  what  the  nominee  accomplished,  including specific  results.  Place  these  statements  under  appropriate  headings  and  in  the  same sequence as described under the criteria requirements for each of the awards. All category headings will be in upper case; nothing else will be written in the category heading line. Be sure that the bullet items address the criteria requirements. Do not include additional criteria  unless  specifically  requested  to  do  so.  Ensure  bullets  contain  accomplishments from  the  current  award  period  only.    Nomination  packages  from  the  same  installation should not share the majority of award bullets; there is a reasonable expectation that some accomplishments  will  be  shared,  but  packages  should  not  be  exceedingly  similar. Nominations will not submit classified information. (T0). 2.2.3.2.  When  using  acronyms  on  award  forms  it  is  not  required  to  spell  out  their meaning  if  those  acronyms  appear  in  Attachment  1,  Glossary  of  References  and Supporting Information, Abbreviations and Acronyms of this AFI or any other 32-series AFI.  Acronyms can be spelled out on page two for all single page nominations submitted on  an  AF  Form  1206.    Abbreviations  and  truncated  words  (similar  to  what  is  used  on Enlisted  Performance  Reports  and  Officer  Performance  Reports)  can  be  used;  for example, “sqd” can be used as an abbreviation for squadron. 2.2.3.3.  Unless  specifically  addressed  all  award  criteria  and  respective  input  will  focus on  mission  and  duty  performance in  support  of  HQ  AF/A4C  objectives.  Accomplishments  reflecting  off-duty  and  community  involvement  will  be  kept  to  an absolute minimum, unless specifically addressed as part of the award criteria.   6 AFI36-2817  25 MAY 2017 2.2.4.

Each  nominee  must  meet  the  award  specific eligibility  requirements  issued  with  the  published  criteria.    Installations  listed  by  the Environmental Protection Agency as a Serious Violator, in Significant Non-Compliance, or  with  a  High  Priority  Violation  in  the  period  of  performance,  will  be  ineligible  to compete in any Environmental award category.

The  panel  members  will  score  and  rank nominations.  The award panel  chairperson will ensure that all scores are  reconciled before selecting and submitting the final rank order for their award. AFI36-2817  25 MAY 2017 7 2.3.2.  All nominations will be submitted to the CE Annual Awards website and ranked from 1-to-end by the award panel and certified by the chairperson.
