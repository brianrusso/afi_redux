The CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide vehicle management personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. Note: Civilians occupying associated positions may use Part II to support duty position qualification training. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) career paths will differ from the career paths depicted in this document. They may develop career paths that more accurately describe the life-cycle of reserve and guard personnel. The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan, manage and control training within the career field. 2.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training and other);  Section D indicates resource constraints (some examples are funds, manpower, equipment and facilities); Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 3.  Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the STSs and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, core task and correspondence course requirements; Section B Optional (not used); Section C identifies available support materials (an example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP) which may be developed to support proficiency training and they are identified in http://www.e-publishing.af.mil); Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training (included here are both mandatory and optional courses); Section E identifies (Major Commands) MAJCOM’s unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. 4.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in vehicle management specialties receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career. This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs. At unit-level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.      3  ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS).

The CFETP provides information necessary for AFCFM, MFMs, commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct effective career field training programs. This plan outlines the training individuals in these AFSs should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training. Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers. UGT identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-skill levels.  Qualification training (QT) is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the UGT process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is formal specialty training for selected Airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses or OJT.  It is provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes to include: 1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct and evaluate a career field training program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty. Identifies sources of training and the training delivery method. 1.4. Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process. 2. Uses. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty. (3) NOTE: The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) serves as the MFM for personnel assigned to Air Force Elements (AFELM). 2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs compliment the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade and proficiency requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training or exportable courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support these AFSCs must be identified for inclusion in the plan.   8  2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. The AETC training manager for 2T3X1 specialties will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. SECTION B: CAREER PROGRESSION AND INFORMATION 4. Specialty Descriptions.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training must do their part to plan, manage and conduct an   14  effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career. The following narrative and AFSCs 2T3X1 Career Development Flow Charts identify career skill progression. 5.1. Apprentice (3-skill level): Upon completion of initial skills training, trainees work with a trainer to enhance their knowledge and skills. Individuals will use a combination of Career Development Courses (CDCs), OJT and advanced courses to progress in the career field. Education toward a CCAF degree should continue. The goal for 5-skill level upgrade training is 24 months but must have a minimum of 12 months of OJT for all 2T3X1 AFSCs. 5.2. Journeyman (5-skill level): Once upgraded to the 5-skill levels, journeymen will enter into continuation training to broaden their experience base. Typical job positions for 5-skill levels include positions requiring supervisory skills such as OJT trainer, quality assurance inspector and materiel control or section supervisor. 5-skill levels will complete required available advanced courses, and MAJCOM specific training. Individuals will attend the Airman Leadership School (ALS) after completing 48 months in the Air Force, or upon selection for promotion to Staff Sergeant. Individuals will use their CDCs and appropriate reference materials to prepare for testing under the Weighted Airman’s Promotions System (WAPS). Education toward a CCAF degree should continue. Note: AFI 24-302 mandates that mechanic technicians in upgrade training to the 7-skill level rotate through each section of vehicle management in order to gain a working knowledge. The goal for 7-skill level upgrade training is 18 months but must have a minimum of 12 months of OJT for all 2T3X1 AFSCs. 5.3. Craftsman (7-skill level): Craftsmen can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions and may be assigned to higher headquarters staff positions and 2T3X1 formal schools. Personnel are encouraged to take courses to obtain added knowledge on management of resources and personnel. Continue academic education through CCAF and higher degree programs. In addition, eligible individuals will complete Enlisted PME developmental courses. 5.4. Superintendent (9-skill level): A 9-skill level is expected to fill leadership, supervisory and management positions such as vehicle fleet manager or vehicle management superintendent, and may be assigned to headquarters staff positions. Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resource, and personnel management is necessary, and can be provided through continuing education. The 9-skill level is awarded upon sew-on of Senior Master Sergeant. Additional higher education and completion of courses outside the career AFSC are also recommended. 6. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the vehicle management career field. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where and how to meet the training requirements. Strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. The CFETP was revised at the Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT) held in February 2015 at Naval Base Ventura County, Port Hueneme, California. 6.1. Initial Skills Training. The initial skills courses were revised to provide the training needed to better prepare graduates for the tasks they will be facing in the field. 6.2. Upgrade Training. Personnel progressing towards AFSCs 2T351, 2T351A and 2T351C are required to complete CDCs sets 2T35XX and 2T35XY prior to taking their AFSC specific volume(s). Note: When proficiency codes identified in Part II of this CFETP, which are common to all AFSCs (2T351, 2T351A and 2T351C), the required material will be included in CDC sets 2T35XX and 2T35XY. Completion of CDC 2T371 is required for award of AFSC 2T371.    15   7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of basic military training. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Sciences Degree. In addition to its associate’s degree program, CCAF offers the following: 7.1. CCAF Instructor Certification. Upon completion of instructor qualification training, consisting of the instructor methods course and supervised practice teaching, CCAF instructors who possess an associate’s degree or higher may be nominated by their school commander/commandant for certification as an occupational instructor. 7.2. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill certification is awarded for the primary occupational specialty. The college uses a competency based assessment process for trade skill certification at one of four proficiency levels: Apprentice, journeyman, craftsman/supervisor or master craftsman/manager. All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript. 7.3. Applicability.  The Vehicle Management program applies to occupational specialties: 2T3X1, 2T3X1A, 2T3X1C and 2T371. 7.3.1. Degree Requirements.

For AFSCs 2T331A, this STS for technical training applies to all classes entering after 04 August 2017. CDC customer need date 19 October 2017. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201 this STS: Lists the mandatory and general tasks, knowledge and Technical References (TRs) necessary for Airmen to perform duties at the 3-, 5- and 7-skill level AFSCs 2T3X1/2T3X1A/2T3X1C/2T371 ladders of the Airman Vehicle Management Career Field. Becomes an AFJQS for OJT when placed in an OJT Record, and used according AFI 36-2201. Provides OJT certification columns in Part 2, Section A to record completion of task and knowledge training requirements. Shows formal training requirements. The 3- and 7-level course columns show the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training in skill-level ascension courses. It is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the WAPS. SKTs are developed at the AETC Airman Advancement Division by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions Resource and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC). Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion/Demotion Programs. WAPS is only applicable to active duty personnel. Qualitative Requirements.  Part 2, Section A contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses. Documentation. Supervisors, trainers and trainees must ensure all training documentation is contained within an Airman’s Individual Training Plan (ITP) in TBA IAW AFI 36-2201 and the current TBA Application User’s Guide. The 2T3X1 AFCFM has not identified any core tasks requiring third-party certification. However, MAJCOMs may establish policy concerning third-party certification. Note: Required up- grade training “core task(s)” identified by local unit, as “not available for training” must be annotated in TBA. The 5- or 7- skill level can then be awarded when all other training and core tasks are complete.  Converting External Task into TBA (Transcription Procedures). This action allows supervisors to convert tasks from an external source (AF Form 623) into TBA. When this action is initiated, the tasks that are converted into TBA go into the Airman’s archived task lists. At that point, the supervisor with authority over the Airman’s record can then select which tasks should be un-archived and moved to an active status IAW the TBA Application User’s Guide. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available: The supervisor identifies CDC training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a minimum, that the trainee covers the mandatory items in the AFECD. For two-time CDC course exams failures:   23  Supervisors identify all STS items corresponding to the areas covered by the CDC. The trainee completes a study of CDC references, undergoes evaluation by the supervisor and receives ITP task completion in TBA. Note: Career knowledge must be documented prior to pursuing a CDC waiver. Decertification and Recertification of ITP Task. When an Airman is found to be unqualified on an ITP task previously completed for their duty position in TBA, the supervisor will take action to decertify the task and complete Journal Entry IAW the TBA Application User’s Guide, Decertify IPT Task instructions. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness and correct use of procedures IAW AFI 36-2201. Comments and Recommendations: Are invited concerning quality of AETC training. Reference specific STS paragraphs and address correspondence regarding changes to 37 TRG/DOS, 1220 Truemper Street, Suite 1, JBSA Lackland, TX 78236-5568. Report inadequacies of this STS through command channels to HQ USAF/A4LE, referencing specific STS paragraphs.  A 24-hour customer service information line (CSIL) has been installed for supervisors to conveniently identify over or under training of performance/knowledge items listed in the training standard.  For a quick response to any training concern, call CSIL, DSN 473-2917 anytime (day or night) or contact us via email at 37TRG.DOS@us.af.mil.  Notes: Users are responsible for updating training references pending revision of this STS. All tasks trained by AETC in 3-skill level courses are considered Wartime Tasks. Items in Core/Wartime Tasks column marked with a symbol/character * are mandatory “core” tasks that must be completed before the next skill level can be awarded. Required up- grade training “core task(s)” identified by local unit, as “not available for training” must be annotated in TBA. Comments regarding training availability may also be annotated in TBA. The 5- or 7-skill level can then be awarded when all other training and core tasks are complete.
