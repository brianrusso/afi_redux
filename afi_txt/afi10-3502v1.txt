Training  programs  are  designed  to  progress  PJs  from  IQT,  to  MQT/Team Member, to Element Leader (EL), to Team Leader (TL).  Training programs for CRO personnel are  designed  to  progress  from  IQT,  to  MQT/TC,  to  Mission  Commander  (MC).    Continuation Training (CT) will be carried on after initial MQT. 1.4.1.  IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify PJ and CRO personnel in basic ground and flight duties without regard to a unit's mission.  Upon completion of IQT PJ and CRO personnel will be designated Unqualified Pararescue (UJ) and immediately move into MQT.  For GA, IQT does not result in a long-term qualification status.  (T-2). 1.4.2.  MQT provides the training necessary to qualify or re-qualify PJ and CRO personnel in ground and flight duties integral to specific unit assigned missions.  PJ and CRO personnel will  maintain  UJ  status  while  performing  flight  duties  until  they  complete  MQT.    MQT completion  is  a  pre-requisite  for  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)  status.    PJ  and  CRO personnel  will  not  deploy  or  perform  operational  missions  until  MQT  is  complete.    PJ personnel who have completed MQT will be designated Mission PJs (MJP).  CRO personnel who have completed MQT will be designated Mission CROs (MJC).  CRO TC upgrade is a mandatory part of CRO MQT.  (T-2). 1.4.3.  CT consists of training in the basic skills contained in Table 5.1 plus any unit- specific training  required  to  accomplish  the  unit's  assigned  missions.    CT  is  a  program  designed  to focus  training  on  capabilities  needed  to  accomplish  broad  spectrum  PR  and  maintain  CMR status. 1.4.3.1.  CMR status is the minimum training for PJ and CRO personnel to be current and qualified  in  all  primary  missions  tasked  to  their  assigned  unit  IAW  this  instruction  and AFI  10-3502  Volume  2,  Pararescue  and  Combat  Rescue  Officer  Standardization  and Evaluation Program.  (T-2). 1.4.3.2.  All PJ and CRO personnel will maintain CMR status by accomplishing all CMR training events IAW Table 5.1.  Failure to complete the training/currency IAW Table 5.1 will result in Non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived IAW this instruction.  (T-2).  1.4.3.3.  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)  is  defined  as  PJ  and  CRO  personnel  that completed mission qualification training.  These individuals are qualified in some aspect of the unit mission, but are not considered to be CMR until all CMR training events are accomplished  IAW  Table  5.1.    (T-2).    NOTE:    Only  PJ  and  CRO  positions  above  (or outside) the Air Force wing level may be designated as Key Staff positions.  Individuals assigned to key staff positions are required to complete only those training events noted IAW Table 5.1 considered mission qualified and will continue to fly as MJs.  Key Staff personnel  will  be  evaluated  only  on  those  training  events  for  which  currency  is maintained  IAW AFI 10-3502V2.  Personnel  so  designated are considered BMC unless they  accomplish  all  CMR  training  events  IAW  Table  5.1.    Appropriate  MFM  is designation authority for Numbered Air Force (NAF) and MAJCOM Key Staff positions.  ACC FTU and AETC Detachment, Squadron, Group and Wing level may be designated as  Key  Staff;  however  they  must  be  current  and  qualified  in  all  tasks  and  currencies  in which  they  provide  instruction.    MFMs  are  designation  authority  for  Detachment, Squadron, Group and Wing Key Staff positions.  (T-2).  10 AFI10-3502V1  30 MARCH 2017 1.4.3.4.  N-CMR  and  BMC  PJ  and CRO  personnel  may  perform  missions  in  support  of civil  authorities,  DoD  assets  and  unsupervised  training  missions  only  in  events  where currency and qualification has been maintained.  (T-3).  1.4.3.5.  N-CMR  and  BMC  personnel  will  not  deploy  or  be  utilized  on  tactical-level combat missions unless waivered IAW this instruction.  (T-2). NOTE:  In rare instances or  instances  of  short-notification,  and  when  a  member  intends  to  deploy  in  a  non-operational capacity, the member may deploy N-CMR provided they meet all combatant command theater entry requirements (TER).  This approval is delegated to the SQ/CC. 1.4.3.6.  Specialized  Training.    Specialized  training  is  training  in  any  special  skills necessary to  carry out  the unit's assigned mission that may not be  required by  every PJ and/or CRO.  Specialized training consists of upgrade training such as trainer/instructor upgrade,  Tandem  Master,  Advanced  Military  Freefall,  etc.,  as  well  as  CT  to  maintain proficiency and qualification in unit tasked special capabilities and missions.  Specialized training  is  accomplished  after  PJ  and/or  CRO  personnel  have  attained  CMR  status.  Unless  otherwise specified, PJ and CRO personnel  in  CMR or Key Staff  positions may attain and maintain specialized certification provided applicable training/currency as long as any additional training requirements are accomplished.  (T-2).  1.4.3.7.  Common Skills Training.  PJ and CRO trainers/instructors may conduct training for tasks common to both AFSCs.  PJ or CRO specific training will be conducted within AFSC only. NOTE:  Other USAF AFSCs, sister service, Department of Defense Civilian employees  and  contracted  trainer/instructor  personnel  may  train/instruct/certify  IQT, MQT,  Upgrade  Training  (UGT),  CT  and  specialized  training  in  like  events  but  must utilize  the  PJ  or  CRO  TCSs  or  applicable  QTP  or  Syllabus  of  Instruction  (SOI).    Only instructor/evaluator PJs or CROs are authorized to make entries in individuals' CFETP or ITEF.  (T-2).  1.5.  Training  Concepts  and  Policies.  The overall objective is to develop and maintain a high state  of  mission  readiness  to  facilitate  immediate  and  effective  employment  in  exercises  and across the range of military operations.  Though not all inclusive, training should be structured to provide  mission  capability  based  on  employment  concepts  identified  in  JP  3-50;  Air  Force Doctrine Annex 3-50; AFPD 16-12, AFPD 10-35, Air Force Tactics Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP)  3-1  and  3-3  Guardian  Angel;  the  unit  Designed  Operational  Capability  (DOC) statement; and approved unit METLs and TCSs. 1.5.1.  Units  will  design  training  missions  to  achieve  combat  capability  in  squadron  tasked roles,  maintain  proficiency,  and  enhance  mission  accomplishment  and  safety.    Training missions should emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect procedures and operations  based  on  employment  plans,  location,  current  intelligence,  and  opposition capabilities.  Use of procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios are desired (e.g., appropriate  use  of  code  words,  authentication  procedures,  combat  tactics,  safe  recovery procedures, tactical deception, intel briefing/debriefing).  Tactical training will include use of live  fire  exercises,  full  mission  profiles,  realistic  medical  scenarios,  and  include  command and control (C2) nodes and reintegration as much as possible.  (T-2).  1.5.2.  PJ and CRO personnel will be afforded a minimum of two hours of the standard duty day  to  maintain  fitness  levels  required  to  perform  operational  missions.   Training  and  real-world  operations require a level  of physical  fitness  above the normal USAF standard.   The AFI10-3502V1  30 MARCH 2017 11 ability to provide sustained performance coupled with rapid recovery from exertion is critical to successfully execute physically and mentally demanding operational mission profiles.  (T-2).  1.6.  Failure  to  complete  training.  If  a  PJ  or  CRO  fails  to  successfully  complete  initial,  re-qualification, or upgrade training, or a repetitive pattern of failure and/or marginal performance occurs,  then  the  individual  should  be  considered  for  removal  from  training  and/or  permanent disqualification  from  the  PJ  or  CRO  AFSC,  IAW  AFI  36-2201,  AFI  11-402,  Aviation  and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, and AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions.  (T-1).  1.7.  Intra-command  and  Inter-command  Transfer  of  PJ  and  CRO  personnel.  Validated training  completed  prior  to  transfer  will  be  honored  by  the  gaining  command.    Members qualified  in  one  command  are  considered  qualified  in  like  equipment  and  to  the  same  level throughout  the  force  when  used  for  the  same  mission.    Current  and  qualified  PJ  and  CRO personnel transferring to a new unit will upon arrival: 1.7.1.  Complete in-processing requirements IAW this AFI and gaining unit requirements. 1.7.2.  Complete Permanent Change of Station (PCS) currency events, as required IAW this AFI. 1.7.3.  Complete MAJCOM/unit-specific MQT requirements, if applicable. 1.8.  Training  Records  and  Reports.

Tracking CRO Training.  All training, certification, and documentation remains under the ITEF for IQT and upgrade training.  The 13DX ITEF, if used as a JQS, is the sole source document for recording all task training. 1.8.2.  Tracking PJ Training.  All training, certification, and documentation remains directly under the Enlisted Specialty Training (EST) and/or OJT system.  The 1T2XX PJ CFETP is the sole source document for recording all task training. 1.8.3.  PJ  and  CRO  personnel  will  document  training  accomplishment  on  the  IMT  1522, ARMS  Additional  Training  Accomplishment  Report,  or the  Squadron  Training Accomplishment Report (TAR) IAW MAJCOM/unit Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).  This data will be input into the ARMS by squadron ARMS personnel. 1.8.4.  Units will use the date of the last equivalent event accomplished to fill in ARMS "NO DATEs” for continuation training requirements.  (T-2).  1.9.  PJ and CRO Utilization Policy. 1.9.1.  PJ  and  CRO  personnel  overall  objective  is  to  perform  PR  duties.    Supervisors  may assign  PJ  and  CRO  personnel  to  valid,  short-term  tasks  (escort  officer,  Flying  Evaluation Board/mishap board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of tasking, proficiency, currency, and experience.

PJs  and  CROs  generally  do  not  require  third  party  certification  on  tasks listed in  their respective  training  records.  There  is  however a small  set of skills  which require further certification before PJ and CRO personnel may perform them unsupervised.  These skills are identified by AF CFMs in the ITEF for CROs and in the CFETP for PJs. AFI10-3502V1  30 MARCH 2017 19 Chapter 5 CONTINUATION TRAINING 5.1.  General.  Continuation  Training  covers  basic  GA  capabilities.    These  requirements  are  to maintain currency only and do not equate to proficiency.  This chapter outlines CT requirements to maintain CMR status. 5.1.1.  CMR Status 5.1.1.1.  CMR  status  results  from  completing  IQT,  MQT,  maintaining  all  CT requirements  and  completing  all  AF  ancillary  training  requirements.    CMR  status  in accordance  with  Table  5.1  qualifies  PJs  and  CROs  for  worldwide  combat  deployment.  (T-2). 5.1.1.2.  Non-Combat  Mission  Ready  status  results  from  failure  to  meet  any  of  the requirements listed in para. 5.1.1.1.  Unless noted, CMR currencies are go/no-go for the individual  currency  event  only.    N-CMR  status  disqualifies  PJs  or  CROs  from  combat deployments.  (T-2). 5.1.1.3.  Non-Training  (NT) status  results from  failure to  meet  designated requirements.  No  training  will  be  conducted  until  requirements  are  met.    NT  currencies  are  go/no-go items  for  all  training  events  except  those  necessary  to  prepare  for  an  overdue  or  failed recurring certification.  (T-2). 5.1.1.4.  Grounded  (G)  status  results  from  failure  to  meet  designated  requirements.  Individuals will not fly until training is completed.  G currencies are considered go/no-go currencies for all flying events.  (T-1).  5.1.2.  CT event frequency is determined by PJ or CRO experience levels.  (T-2). 5.1.2.1.  PJ  3/5  levels  are  considered  inexperienced  for  the  purposes  of  CT.    CT  events will be accomplished using frequencies listed in the inexperienced column of Table 5.1.  (T-2).    NOTE:    PJ  5  levels  are  considered  experienced  one  year  following  award  of  5 level. 5.1.2.2.  CROs are considered inexperienced for the purposes of CT until they have held the  TC  designation  for  three  years.    CT  events  will  be  accomplished  using  frequencies listed in the inexperienced column of Table 5.1.  (T-2). 5.1.2.3.  PJ 7/9 levels are considered experienced for the purposes of CT.  CT events will be accomplished using frequencies listed in the experienced column of Table 5.1.  (T-2). 5.1.2.4.  CROs  are  considered  experienced  for  the  purposes  of  CT  once  they  have  held the  TC  designation  for  three  years.    CT  events  will  be  accomplished  using  frequencies listed in the experienced column of Table 5.1.  (T-2). 5.2.  Combat  Mission  Ready  Training  Requirements.  Table  5. 1  defines  currency requirements for all PJ and CRO personnel. 5.2.1.  If  an  event’s  frequency  is  exceeded,  that  event  may  not  be  performed  except  for  the purpose  of  regaining  currency.    Currency  will  be  regained  under  supervision  of  a 20 AFI10-3502V1  30 MARCH 2017 trainer/certifier  or  instructor  who  is  current  and  qualified  in  the  same  task  to  the  same  or greater level required by the CFETP or ITEF.  (T-2). 5.2.2.  Events  in  which  a  periodic  currency  has  been  established  will  be  considered  trained and qualified to the specified level in the event until 181 days following the expiration of the currency.  After this period the member must be retrained IAW a SQ/CC directed retraining, recertification or requalification program.  Qualification events require the completion of all evaluations  for  the  event  in  question  IAW  AFI  10-3502V2.    The  SQ/CC  may  approve adjustments  to  the  training  program  based  on  individual  experience  level  and  training requirements.    SQ/CC  approved  training  must  be  documented  in  the  individual  CFETP  or ITEF.  (T-2). 5.2.3.  Deployment  Currency.    If  a  member  goes  non-current  in  a  CMR  item  and  has  the ability to re-accomplish this task, all efforts will be made to regain currency.  If the deployed member is  unable or prohibited from  regaining the currency due to  operational  restrictions, the  member  will  remain  current  through  the  duration  of  the  deployment.    Upon  return,  all overdue currencies will be regained IAW para. 5.2.1. (T-2).  Table 5.1.  Combat Mission Ready Currencies.

Medical Skills Certification Scoring/Grading Guide. The  Pararescue  Medical  Skills  certification’s  purpose  is  to  certify  an  operator’s  medical competency.    The  certification  is  divided  into  two  sections:    a  physical  assessment  and  a cognitive discussion of protocols and medications.  An operator must pass both sections with an 80% or above for successful certification.  Points are awarded based on competency during each event- awarded based on the knowledge presented by the operator at  the  evaluator’s discretion.  For sections that are N/A to the scenario, the evaluator will ensure a verbalization of the sections is  completed  by  the  operator  before  or  after  the  scenario,  ensuring  competency  for  all  sections.

The  order  for  conducting  the  evaluation  is:    3-mile  run,  pull-ups,  sit-ups,  pushups,  and 1500-meter  swim.    After  the  3-mile  run,  a  rest  of  no  more  than  15  minutes  is  given  prior  to starting  the  calisthenics.    Calisthenics  events  will  be  tested  one  after  the  other  with approximately 2-minutes rest between events.  Upon completion of all calisthenics events, a rest of  no  more  than  15  minutes  is  given  prior  to  starting  the  1500M  swim.    Failure  to  meet  the physical  fitness  standard  for  any  event  constitutes  failure  of  the  entire  test.  Score  IAW  para. A3.6.    The  test  is  intended  to  mirror  the  AF  PFT  requirements  so  that  measurements  can  be recorded at appropriate intervals for dual credit, i.e., annotate time at 1.5 mile; number of sit up and push up reps at one minute.  (T-3). A3.2.  Three-Mile  Run  .    This  exercise  is  performed  in  running  shoes.    This  exercise  is designed to measure aerobic endurance during specific mission tasks.  Endurance is required to perform overland movement, climbing, load-bearing, and hand-to-hand combat tasks. A3.2.1.  Q.  Greater than or equal to 120, 110, 100 points based on age. A3.2.2.  U.  Less than 120,110,100 points based on age. A3.3.  Pull  ups  (time  limit:    one  minute).    This  exercise  is  executed  on  a  pull-up  bar.    The individual grasps the bar with the palms away from the face, shoulder width apart.  This is a two-count  exercise.    The  exercise  begins  in  the  “dead  hang”  position.    Count  one;  pull  the  body directly upward until the chin is over the bar.  Count two, lower the body until the body is again in the “dead hang” position.  Individuals will not swing excessively or bicycle feet as the chin is pulled  over  the  bar.    Repeat  as  many  times  as  possible.    This  exercise  is  designed  to  measure strength  and  endurance  in  the  back/shoulder  and  triceps/biceps  muscles  used  during  specific mission tasks.  Strength and endurance in these muscle groups are required to perform parachute control and climbing tasks. A3.3.1.  Q.  Greater than or equal to 40 points. A3.3.2.  U.  Less than 40 points. A3.4.  Sit-ups  (time limit:  two minutes).  Start with the back flat on the ground, knees bent at approximately  a  90-degree  angle,  arms  crossed  over  the  chest  with  the  hands  at  the  shoulders, resting on the upper chest.  Another individual may hold the feet during the exercise or secured under an anchored “toe-hold” bar.  This is a two-count exercise.  Count one; sit up until elbows contact  the  thigh  or  knee.    Count  two,  return  to  the  starting  position.    If  an  individual  raises buttocks  from  ground  or  his  hands/fingers  break  contact  with  the  chest/shoulders  during  a repetition, the repetition is not counted.  The only authorized rest position is in the up position.  This exercise is designed to measure strength and endurance in abdominal and hip flexor muscle groups used during specific mission tasks.  Strength  and endurance in  these muscle  groups are required to perform swimming, lifting, and load-bearing and hand-to-hand combat tasks. A3.4.1.  Q.  Greater than or equal to 40 points. A3.4.2.  U.  Less than 40 points. AFI10-3502V1  30 MARCH 2017 41 A3.5.  Pushups  (time  limit:    two  minutes).    This  exercise  starts  from  the  front  leaning  rest position.  The body must be maintained straight from head to heels with knees together.  This is a two-count exercise.  Count one; flex the elbows, lowering the body until the elbows form a 90-degree  angle.    Count  two;  raise  the  body  until  the  elbows  are  straight  and  locked.    Repeat  this exercise  as  many  times  as  possible.    Event  is  stopped  when  individual  lifts  an  arm  or  a  knee touches the ground.  The only authorized  rest position is the starting position.  This exercise is designed  to  measure  the  strength  and  endurance  of  the  chest  and  triceps  muscles  used  during specific mission tasks.  Strength and endurance in these muscle groups are required to perform swimming, lifting, climbing, load-bearing and hand-to-hand combat tasks. A3.5.1.  Q.  Greater than or equal to 40 points. A3.5.2.  U.  Less than 40 points. A3.6.  1500  Meter  Swim  .    The  swim  may  be  performed  with  swim  trunks,  facemask,  or goggles,  snorkel,  and  fins  using  any  stroke.    If  swim  is  performed  in  open  water,  a  life preserver/flotation device must be worn (exempt when within 100m of shore and/or a safety boat is  in  attendance).    10  minutes  will  be  added  to  maximum  times  in  Table  6.3  for  open  water swims.    This  exercise  is  designed  to  measure  aerobic  endurance  and  swimming  ability  during specific  mission  tasks.    Endurance  and  swimming  ability  are  required  to  perform  maritime transits as well as underwater dive recovery tasks. A3.6.1.  Q.  Greater than or equal to 120, 110, 100 points based on age. A3.6.2.  U.  Less than 120,110,100 points based on age. A3.7.  Score  .  Exercise, run and swim times will be rounded off to the next lower point value as depicted in Attachment 7.  A composite score of all events determines the overall score.  A total score greater than or equal to 430 is a Q, greater than or equal to 320 but less than 430 is a Q-, and less than 320 is  a U.   NOTE:  Failing to  meet  the minimum  standards in  any of the areas assessed will result in an overall Q-3 regardless of total score.  (T-3).   42 AFI10-3502V1  30 MARCH 2017 Table A3.1.
