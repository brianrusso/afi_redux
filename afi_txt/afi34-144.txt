Program  Overview.  The  mission  of  Air  Force  Child  and  Youth  Programs  (CYP)  is  to assist  DoD  military  and  civilian  personnel  in  balancing  the  competing  demands  of  the accomplishment  of  the  DoD  mission  and  family  life  through  delivery  of  a  system  of  quality, available and affordable programs and services for eligible children and youth birth through 18 years of age.  It is AF policy to ensure CYP:  1.1.1.  Provide  child  and  youth  development  programs  in  a  manner  that  supports  personnel and the Air Force mission.  As child care is a work force benefit, eligibility is contingent on the status of the custodial sponsor.  For additional eligibility information, see Department of Defense  (DoD)  Instruction  (DoDI)  6060.02,  Child  Development  Programs  and  Air  Force Instruction  34-101,  Air  Force  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR)  Programs  and  Use Eligibility.   1.1.2.

Program,  budget  and  allocate  funds  and  other  resources  to  meet  Military  Child  Care Act (MCCA) requirements and protect the health, safety and well-being of children/youth in a nurturing environment.   1.1.4.  Employ qualified personnel whose progression from entry level to positions of greater responsibility is determined by training, education, experience and competency.   1.1.5.  Promote the cognitive, social, emotional, cultural, language and physical development of  children/youth  through  programs  and  services  recognizing  their  differences  and encouraging  self-confidence,  curiosity,  creativity,  self-discipline  and  resiliency  while providing  experiential  learning  for  literacy,  mathematics,  science,  social  studies,  life  skills, healthy lifestyles, the arts and technology.  1.1.6.  Promote the prevention, early identification and reporting of child abuse or neglect in Air Force CYP in accordance with DoDD 6400.01, Family Advocacy Program and AFI 40-301, Family Advocacy.   1.1.7.  Facilitate the availability and expansion of quality, affordable, community-based child care which meets the intent of this instruction to support families unable to access installation care. 1.1.8.  Participate  in  all  required  annual  internal  certification  and  external  accreditation processes to ensure CYP are operating in accordance with all applicable Air Force, DoD and federal mandates and statutory requirements.     AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 13 1.2.

A  fire  inspector,  trained  CYP  manager  or  FCC provider  must  conduct  evacuation  drills  in  accordance  with  the  AFCEC  Fire  Inspection  Guide.  The  AFCEC  recommended  procedures  for  evacuation  drills  must  be  followed.    CYP  shall practice  monthly  evacuation  drills  and  a  minimum  of  two  (varying  scenarios)  shelter-in-place drills per year.  Drills are documented and kept on file.  (T-1) 5.8.1.  An approved evacuation map with designated emergency exits and written emergency instructions must be posted in all CYP activity rooms by the exit door, front lobby, kitchen, and  offices.    FCC  evacuation  plans  must  be  reviewed  by  the  FCC  Coordinators.    FCC providers must post their evacuation maps and written instructions on the parent board.  The recommended  procedures  for  evacuations  are  followed.    CYP  personnel  will  sweep  the classrooms to ensure all children are accounted for during the drill.  Managers and Training and Curriculum Specialists will check every room in the facility to ensure no children are left behind. 5.8.1.1.  Everyone on site must participate in evacuations or shelter in place.  Parents are not  permitted  to  sign  children  in  or  out.    Accountability  of  all  children/youth  must  be maintained. 5.8.2.  CDC evacuation drills are conducted monthly including a minimum of two shelter in place drills  per  year.   During  a drill  or evacuation, CDC teaching staff  carry the AF Form 1930, Youth Flight Daily Attendance, for each group of children/youth to perform a name to face accountability check.  The CDC clerk (or designee), using the AF Form 1182 or printout from  the  approved  data  system,  will  perform  a  by  name  cross  check  with  AF  Form  1930. Clerks will calculate the total number of children and adults for reporting accountability. 5.8.3.  SAC evacuation drills are conducted monthly with two during the  first  weeks of the school year and summer program including a minimum of two shelter in place drills per year.   The  SAC  clerk  (or  designee),  using  the  AF  Form  1930  will  perform  a  name  to  face accountability  check.  Clerks  will  calculate  the  total  number  of  children  and  adults  for reporting accountability. AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 53 5.8.4.  YP    evacuation  drills  are  conducted  monthly  including  a  minimum  of  two  shelter  in place drills per year.

A clerk or designee will calculate the total number of youth and adults for reporting accountability.     5.8.5.  An evacuation drill is practiced in the FCC home once a month including a minimum of two shelter in place drills per year.  If drills are missed due to severe weather, additional drills  are  held  in  the  other  months.    At  no  time  should  there  be  more  than  two  months between drills.   5.8.5.1.  The  house  fire  alarm  is  sounded  for  every  drill  using  the  smoke  alarm  test button.  Use  of  an  audible  signal  (or  the  smoke  alarm  test  button)  during  drills  is  not required  when the FCC  home is  located in  an apartment  building provided with  system smoke  detectors  that  activate  the  building  evacuation  alarm  rather  than  just  the  alarms within an individual FCC home. 5.8.5.2.  All persons in the FCC home shall participate in evacuation drills.  5.8.6.  If children/youth are not properly accounted for during drills, the AFS flight chief is notified  and  an  AF  Form  3424,  Reportable  Incident,  is  completed.    The  lapse  in accountability is analyzed to determine the root cause and CYP Personnel/FCC providers are retrained as necessary.   5.9.  Additional Requirements for FCC. 5.9.1.

Sudden  Infant  Death  Syndrome  Prevention  Practices.  CDC  and  FCC  providers  will follow the current recommended practices from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the AF CDC/FCC  Safe  Sleep  Instructional  Guide  to  reduce  the  potential  for  Sudden  Infant  Death Syndrome (SIDS). (T-1) 6.6.1.  The  current  AF  Infant  Safe  Sleep  Sign  is  posted  in  the  infant  sleeping  area  and followed.  6.6.2.  CDC  Managers,  FCC  Coordinators  or  T&C  Specialists  train  CDC  staff  and  FCC providers  on  safe  sleep  practices  and  monitor  for  compliance.  All  CDC  infant  classroom substitutes, FCC adult household  members,  FCC substitute providers  as  well as  contractors working in CYP (e.g. Military Family Life Counselors) must also receive training.   6.6.3.  Infants are directly observed by sight and sound at all times, including when they are going to sleep, are sleeping or are in the process of waking up.   Checking on sleeping infants shall  not  disrupt  the  infant’s  sleep  or  interrupt  the  interactions  with  other  children  who  are awake.  Frequency of checks shall reflect knowledge of an individual child’s characteristics (for example, a child with reflux may need more frequent checks).  6.6.4.  To reduce the risk of SIDS, infants must be placed for sleep on their back until they have reached one year of age.  Infants may then be allowed to assume any comfortable sleep position when they can easily turn themselves from the back position.  6.6.5.  Any  deviation  from  the  Safe  Sleep  policy  requires  documentation  from  the  child’s health  care  provider  and  approval  from  the  Installation  CYP  Medical  Advisor,  AFS  Flight Chief and concurrence from AFSVA/SVPY.  In the case of such exception, a notice will be posted on the infant's crib without identifying medical information. The full documentation is kept in the infant's file. 6.6.6.  Crib  mattresses  must  be  firm  and  maintain  their  shape  even  when  the  fitted  sheet designated for that model is used.  There must not be any gaps between the mattress and the side of the crib, bassinet, portable crib, or play yard. 6.6.7.  Infants will not be placed on or sleep on any beds other than an approved crib while in FCC because of the risk of entrapment and suffocation. 6.6.8.  Soft cushions, such as pillows, quilts, comforters, blankets, bumper pads, sheepskins, stuffed toys and other soft materials will be kept out of infant cribs.  These items must not be placed under or near a sleeping infant.  If infants need to be covered when they are sleeping, only wearable blankets are permitted. 6.6.9.  Swaddling and covering of the face and head will not be permitted. 6.6.10.  Infants will sleep in an area free of hazards such as dangling cords and electric wires. 58 AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 6.6.11.  Bibs and pacifiers will not be tied around the infant’s neck or clipped to an infant’s clothing during sleep. Infants who use pacifiers may be offered their pacifiers when they are placed to sleep.  6.6.12.  Sitting devices, such as car safety seats, bouncers, strollers, infant carriers and infant slings are not permitted to be used for routine sleep.   6.6.13.  If  an  infant  falls  asleep  in  a  sitting  device,  he  or  she  must  be  removed  from  the device and moved to a crib or other appropriate flat surface.   6.6.14.  Thin,  single  layer  receiving  blankets  may  be  used  in  the  play  area;  however,  the infant must be on his/her back, be awake and be directly monitored by classroom staff during this play time.  Once infants  begin  to  move independently,  blankets  will  no longer be used during floor time play.   6.7.  Signs and Symptoms of Illness.  Children/youth shall be screened at the time of entry and during  care  for  signs  of  illness.  Children/youth  may  not  be  accepted  into  care  when  ill.  Children/youth shall be accepted only when their presence no longer impacts the health of other children as confirmed by the child’s/youth’s health care provider. 6.7.1.  CYP  personnel  and  FCC  providers  shall  know  how  to  recognize  the  signs  and symptoms of illness to ensure  immediate medical needs are addressed.  CDC, SAC and YP must follow the current version of The American Academy of Pediatrics Managing Infectious Diseases in Child Care and School  for exclusion of children/youth and readmission into the program. 6.7.2.  Parents  shall  be  informed  when  their  child/youth  is  injured,  exposed  to  disease, experiencing distress or becomes ill.   6.7.3.  Adults to include staff, contractors, specified volunteers and parents with a contagious illness shall have restricted access to CYP.  6.7.4.  Youth  with  broken  bones  or  other  serious  injuries  shall  not  participate  in  physical activities without a health care provider’s approval.  6.8.  Communicable  Diseases.  If  a  communicable  disease  is  reported  by  the  Medical Community  or  Public  Health,  the  Installation  CYP  Medical  Advisor  will  coordinate  on  any communication  provided  to  parents.    CYP  staff  will  notify  AFSVA/SVI  and  consult  with AFSVA/SVPY when a communicable disease causes modifications to any CYP.  (T-1) 6.8.1.  During  documented  communicable  disease  outbreaks,  individuals  without  current vaccinations/immunizations or an approved exemption from AF/A1S will not be allowed to participate  in  the  program  unless  the  Installation  CYP  Medical  Advisor  approves  of  their participation.   6.9.

A  system  must  be  in  place  to  ensure  children/youth  are  not  exposed  foods  or environmental contaminants that may be harmful to them (e.g. allergens).   7.2.1.  Parents sign a statement of consent permitting the programs to post their child/youth’s allergy information (with or without pictures).  7.2.2.  A current list of children/youth with allergies is discretely posted in a standard way: 7.2.2.1.  In  each  CDC  and  SAC  activity  room  and  is  also  posted  in  the  CDC/SAC kitchen. 7.2.2.2.  In  youth/teen  center  rooms  (or  a  centralized  location  that  provides  staff-only access), in the kitchen and snack bar. 7.2.2.3.  In each FCC home. 7.2.2.4.  All  staff  (including  substitutes)  is  trained  on  where  this  information  is  located.  The allergy listing is taken on field trips. 7.2.3.  Children/youth  who  have  been  identified  with  a  food  allergy  or  who  are  otherwise intolerant to  specific  foods  must  be  offered  nutritionally  equivalent  substitutes. Documentation  to  include  recommended  food  substitutions  and  an  exposure  response  plan must be provided by the child/youth’s health care provider and maintained on file. 7.3.  Drinking  Water.  Drinking  water  is  provided  indoors,  outdoors  and  on  field  trips  via  single service cups or water fountains. 7.3.1.

In CDC/SAC, paper products are only used during emergencies; Styrofoam products are prohibited. 7.5.  Meal  Service.  Meal  times  should  be  a  pleasant,  social  learning  experience  for children/youth and provide opportunities to promote healthy nutrition habits.  7.5.1.  Food service staff provide timely delivery of food in a “ready to eat” manner without adding additional responsibilities (e.g. cutting up food) for classroom staff.   7.5.2.  CDC/SAC  staff  and  FCC  providers  sit  and  eat  with  the  children/youth  and  engage them  in  conversation.    Children/youth  are  encouraged  to  serve  themselves  based  on  their developmental abilities.    7.5.3.  Children/youth will be encouraged to participate with table setting and clean up after meal times.  7.5.4.  Youth  enrolled  in  SAC  may  have  a  snack  as  an  activity  choice  instead  of  eating together as a large group. Snacks are available for youth when they arrive at the program and youth  have  enough  time  to  eat  without  rushing.    Youth  are  notified  before  snacks  are  put away.  7.5.5.  Food is not used as a punishment or reward.  7.6.  Food Purchasing for CDC/SAC.  The majority of food items must be purchased from the Prime  Vendor.    The  Commissary  and  approved  local  sources  may  be  used  to  purchase  foods unavailable from the Prime Vendor.   7.6.1.  All  food  must  be  inspected  at  delivery  for  spoilage,  sanitation,  or  potentially hazardous  conditions  (e.g.  cans  with  dents  or  signs  of  rust,  frozen  foods  at  inappropriate temperatures, spoiled fruits and vegetables) and returned to the vendor.   7.6.2.  For accountability purposes, the individual placing the food order may not also be the receiver of the order.  Receivers must verify quantities and annotate overages, shortages and substitutions.    7.6.3.  Proper control of food cost depends on accurate forecasting, purchasing food only as needed,  proper  storage,  preparation  and  portion  control.    Programs  purchase  serving  bowls and utensils for determining the actual portion of food needed for each age grouping.   7.7.  CYP Facility Food Storage.  Conduct IAW AFMAN_IP 48-147, Triservice Food Code. 7.7.1.  All foods are labeled and dated upon delivery to the kitchen.   7.7.2.

Foods that have been thawed to room temperature or that have been held in the refrigerator longer than one day are not refrozen and are used immediately.  7.7.3.3.  The  First-In-First-Out  (FIFO)  method  (placing  new  products  behind  older products or below older products in the storage area) is used for stock rotation to ensure older products are used first.  7.7.4.  Open food is stored in tightly covered containers and labeled with the date.   7.8.  FCC  Home  Food  Storage.  FCC  providers  ensure  dry,  refrigerated  and  frozen  goods  are stored in a safe manner that reduces likelihood of contamination or food borne illness. 7.9.  Food  Preparation.  Food  must  be  prepared,  handled,  transported  and  served  according  to applicable Air Force Instructions, USDA CACFP guidelines and Public Health requirements.    7.9.1.  CYP  personnel  and  FCC  providers  must  have  ServSafe  Food  Safety  training  as required  by  their  position.    CYP  managers  and  food  service  personnel  must  have supplemental training from the installation Public Health office, to emphasize the impact of food safety on the Air Force mission IAW AFI 48-116. (T-1) 7.9.2.  CYP managers, food service personnel, and any other individuals assisting with food preparation must wear a hair restraint (e.g. hairnet, cap) while working in the facility kitchen and handling food. Anyone with a cold, infection or open wound must not handle food.   7.9.3.  Food  prepared  in  another  facility  must  be  transported  using  sanitary  containers  and kept at the appropriate temperatures during transportation and delivery.   7.9.4.

The  three-step  method  (wash,  rinse,  sanitize  in  a  water  and chlorine bleach solution) must be used if a dishwasher is not available.  7.10.1.  Cutting boards shall be cleaned and sanitized, before each use with a different type of raw  animal  food  such  as  beef,  fish,  lamb,  pork,  or  poultry  and  each  time  there  is  a  change from working with raw foods to working with ready to eat products (e.g. fruits, vegetables) to control the potential for cross contamination. 7.10.2.  Kitchen  equipment  including  small  appliances  must  be  cleaned  and  sanitized  after each use.  7.10.3.  FCC providers must wash dishes, utensils, cookware, serving items and infant bottles in  a  dishwasher.    If  a  dishwasher  is  unavailable,  items  are  washed  by  hand  in  hot  water containing a detergent solution, rinsed, and then sanitized by immersing each item for at least two minutes in lukewarm water.  Dishes must be air dried.  Paper or plastic products may be used if dishwasher is not available.    68 AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 7.11.  Feeding Infants and Young Children.  Bottle feeding must be done in such a way as to minimize the spread of disease and promote interaction.  CDC and FCC providers must follow the  policies  and  procedures  in  the  AF  Instructional  Guide  on  Feeding  Infants  and  Young Children.    Other  references  include  Caring  for  Our  Children:    National  Health  and  Safety Standards  Guidelines  and  USDA  Feeding  Infants,  A  guide  for  Use  in  the  Child  Nutrition Programs.)   7.11.1.  CDC will provide two types of iron fortified infant formula (IFIF):  one regular and one soy-based.  If the parent/guardian chooses to provide the IFIF, the parent/guardian may bring  pre-made  bottles  or  provide  IFIF  in  a  factory  sealed  container  to  be  prepared  by  the CDC.  Bulk preparation of IFIF will be prepared in a clean and sanitized work space in the facility kitchen.  CDC personnel may fill individual bottles in the classroom.  7.11.2.  A  system  will  be  in  place  to  ensure  young  children  receive  only  their  own  IFIF  or human  milk.    Each  bottle  must  be  labeled  with  the  child’s  first  and  last  name  and  labeled with the date and time the IFIF/human milk was prepared or expressed.  CDC staff and FCC providers will check the name on the bottle to ensure they are feeding the right bottle to the right  child.    7.11.2.1.    Infants  and  young  children  who  are  developmentally  ready  to  drink from a cup can be offered human milk in a no-spill sippy cup.  Additional measures such as close supervision (infant/young child sitting next to an adult), safe storage, and serving must also  be  in  place  to  prevent  other  infants  and  young  children  from  being  exposed  to  human milk not intended for their consumption.   7.11.3.  Human milk must be brought in, in ready to feed bottles and may not be stored in the refrigerator (41 degrees Fahrenheit) for more than 48 hours, or no more than 24 hours if the human milk was previously frozen.  Human milk may be stored in a freezer at zero degrees Fahrenheit or below for no longer than three months.   7.11.4.  IFIF must be discarded within one hour of removing from the refrigerator.  Partially used human milk bottles may be discarded or returned to the parent at the end of the day.  7.11.5.  If parents/guardians purchase human milk for use in CDC/FCC, it must be purchased from  a  milk  bank  which  screens,  pasteurizes    and  ensures  shipping  is  conducted  in  a  safe manner.  Refer to the American Academy of Pediatrics website for guidance.  7.11.6.  Infant cereal, fruit juice, or any other foods will not be added to bottles with IFIF or human milk unless prescribed in writing by the child’s health care provider and approved by the installation CYP Medical Advisor.   7.11.7.  Microwave ovens, bottle warmers, crock pots and heated pans of water are not to be used for warming IFIF or human milk.  If IFIF and human milk is warmed, it is warmed in a container of water which does not  exceed 98.6 degrees  Fahrenheit.  Excessive heating may destroy beneficial nutritional components.  7.11.8.  CDC  personnel  and  FCC  providers  will  wash  their  hands  before  handling  and serving  any  human  milk,  infant  formula  or  age  appropriate  solid  food.    Infants’  and  young children’s hands will also be washed before being served bottles or infant food.  7.11.9.  Infants who are less than 8 months old and who are unable to independently sit will be held for bottle and spoon-feeding.  Both criteria must be met.  Other feeding methods are AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 69 permitted  if    prescribed  in  writing  by  the  child’s  health  care  provider  and  approved  by  the installation CYP Medical Advisor. 7.11.10.  Infants and young children may not carry bottles or sippy cups around with them in the activity room or FCC home.  7.11.11.  Cow’s milk must not be offered to children less than 1 year of age unless prescribed in writing by the child’s health care provider and approved by the installation CYP Medical Advisor.   7.11.12.  Due to the risk of infant botulism, children younger than 1 year of age should not be fed any honey products or served baked goods containing honey.   7.11.13.  CDC  personnel  and  FCC  providers  who  inadvertently  feed  human  milk  to  the wrong  child  must  treat  the  incident  as  an  exposure  to  bodily  fluids  due  to  the  possible exposure to Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or Human Immunodeficiency Virus.   7.11.13.1.  Immediate notification must be made to the program supervisor, who in turn will notify the parents, encouraging them to contact their child’s health care provider for further guidance.   7.11.13.2.  The  installation  Public  Health  office  and  the  CYP  Medical  Advisor  will  be notified.   7.11.13.3.  The incident must be reported on the AF Form 3424 Reportable Incident.  7.12.  Solid  Foods.

Adequate resources must be  provided  to  protect  the  health  and  safety  of  children/youth  and  to  promote  child  and  youth development.   8.2.  Appropriated Funds.  Appropriated funds (APF) support is authorized for CYP.  8.2.1.  The  amount  of  APF  direct  support  used  to  operate  CDC/SAC  programs  must  be  at least equal to parent fees collected.    8.2.2.  APFs  may  be  used  in  CYP  for  salaries  of  employees,  food,  training  and  education, educational  field  trip  transportation  and  entry  fees,  program  accreditation  fees  and  support services,  contracted  services  (e.g.  sports  officials,  camps),  transportation,  marketing (recruitment, retention, and participation efforts), supplies and equipment.  APFs may also be used  in  FCC  to  purchase  materials  for  the  resource  center,  training  materials  for  providers, local travel expenses incurred by FCC program staff using their private vehicles to perform government  functions  and  direct  monetary  subsidies  to  FCC  providers.  Reference  AFI  65-106,  Appropriated  Fund  Support  for  Morale,  Welfare  and  Recreation  and  Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities for additional guidance.  8.3.  Nonappropriated Funds.  Nonappropriated Funds (NAF) will not be used where APFs are otherwise authorized.  8.3.1.  To the maximum extent possible, child care fees shall cover the NAF cost of care and NAF costs not covered by child care fees are to be minimized.  8.3.2.  Other potential sources of NAFs include funding received from Air Force Aid Society, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Combined Federal Campaign, USDA and similar sources, to include the installation MWR fund.  Assistance in reviewing and drafting grant applications as well as proposed donations/gifts should be obtained from the installation legal office. 8.3.3.  Nonappropriated  Fund  (NAF)  Financial  goals  are  based  on  the  Consolidated  Net Income  after  Depreciation  (NIAD)  and  are  between  zero  to  4  percent  for  the  CDC  and  no more  than  10  percent  for  SAC  at  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.    YP  shall  not  be  required  to generate a profit or generate funds to support adult programs. 8.4.  CDC/SAC Fees.  DoD prescribes uniform fee regulations annually according to Chapter 88 of title 10, United States Code which applies to  families who attend regularly  scheduled CDC, SAC,  and  subsidized  FCC  programs.      Each  installation  must  implement  the  weekly  fee established for each category.  Installation fees may only be changed once per year.   8.4.1.  Parent  fees  are  only  used  to  cover  the  cost  of  the  NAF  staff  wages,  benefits,  and training  including  recruitment  and  retention  initiatives,  consumable  supplies  (e.g.  paper goods, pet food/bedding, art supplies, sunscreen, trash bags, laundry detergent, materials that have  a  one-time  use)  and    food-related  expenses  not  paid  from  appropriated  funds  or reimbursed by the United States Department of Agriculture Child and Adult Food Program.     8.4.2.  The  installation  may  use  the  high  market  adjustment  rate  in  areas  that  pay  higher wages to compete with local labor or where staff  wages are affected by non-foreign cost of AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 71 living  allowance  (COLA),  base  differential,  or  locality  pay  as  indicated  in  DoDI  6060.02.  The  optional  low  market  adjustment  rate  may  be  used  in  areas  where  costs  for  comparable care  within  the  installation  catchment  area  are  significantly  lower.    The  high/low  market adjustment rate requires annual approval from A1/A1SOC.   8.4.3.  Child  care  fees  do  not  require  NAF  Council  approval  as  total  family  income  ranges and weekly rates  are set by DoD policy.  8.4.4.  Programs  must  notify  Defense  civilian  employee  sponsors  with  children  enrolled  in DoD  subsidized  CDC/SAC  programs  that  they  are  subject  to  the  requirements  of  Internal Revenue  Code,  title  26,  United  States  Code,  section  61  and  title  26,  Code  of  Federal Regulations, section 1.61-1. 8.4.5.  Fee  categories  are  based  on  50  hours  of  care  per  week;  however  programs  may  be open more or less hours.  8.4.6.  Programs will  provide a discount for families who have multiple children enrolled in the CDC, SAC or FCC Subsidy program. 8.4.7.  Fees  are  based  on  total  family  income  (TFI)  and  apply  to  all  children  who  attend CDC, SAC and FCC Subsidy programs on regular basis.  Combat related wounded warriors are assessed Fee Category I regardless of TFI. 8.4.7.1.  The DD Form 2652, Application for Department of Defense Child Care Fees, or electronic equivalent, will be used to verify TFI.  8.4.7.2.  Programs will verify patron TFI annually and adjust fees accordingly. 8.4.8.  The  MSG/CC  may  reduce  a  family’s  fees  based  on  unusual  financial  circumstances, such as when a  family’s total  income declines to  a lower fee category.   The MSG/CC may not delegate this authority.  (T-1) 8.4.8.1.  The new adjusted fee must be on the installation’s advertised fee scale and may not be set below Fee Category I.   8.4.8.2.  With  approval  from  AF/A1SOC,  adjustments  may  be  made  to  adjust  fees  for CDC/SAC  teaching  staff  if  programs  experience  operational  hardships  (e.g.  staffing shortage).   8.4.9.  Parents  must  be  notified  of  fee  changes  at  least  30  days  in  advance.    Programs  may meet this requirement by posting and announcing the annual DoD fee scale to parents while installation fees are being approved and TFI calculations are being made.  8.4.10.  CDC/SAC  parents  will  be  given  the  option  of  subletting  or  renting  their  space.  Under  no  circumstance  shall  the  authorized  user  of  the  space  profit  from  the  subletting  or rental  of  their  space.    Parents  occupying  the  sublet/rental  space  must  be  notified  of  the conditions upon which their space may be terminated and enrollment in a sublet/rental space does not give them higher priority on the waiting list if a permanent space becomes available. 8.4.11.  CDC/SAC registration fees may not be collected since the labor used to collect such fees is paid from appropriated funds.   8.4.12.  CDC/SAC  programs  may  offer  discounts  for  participating  in  an  approved  parent participation program.  72 AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 8.4.13.  SAC fees include the following additional requirements:   8.4.13.1.

Additional fees, outside the hours that are included in the weekly fee (e.g. teacher work days, inclement weather), will be assessed at the Total Family Income (TFI) hourly rate.   8.4.13.3.2.  The  rate  for  special  openings  (e.g.  Parents  Night  Out,  holiday  party)  or drop-in  care will be a flat  hourly rate (not based on TFI) for all patrons  and will be equal to or greater than the highest fee per hour for full-day care.   8.4.13.3.3.  For summer day camp, parents will be charged for the number of weeks requested.   8.4.13.3.4.  Charges  for  instructional  classes,  entertainment  events  or  transportation fees are additional and separate from the weekly fees.   8.4.14.

There  may  not  be  more  than  a  two  year  age  range  used  to  establish  and  conduct league  play.    All  participants  must  be  at  least  5  years  of  age  prior  to  the  start  of  the  first practice.  If a program wishes to have an age range greater than three years, the installation requests a waiver from AFSVA/SVPY.  (T-2) 11.28.6.  Youth are not permitted to participate in league sports unless they have had a sports physical  within the previous 12 months;  exams must remain current  throughout  the season.  Results of physical exams must be on file.  11.28.7.  Children/youth  are  protected    when  they  participate  in  fitness,  youth  sports,  and recreational activities.  11.28.8.  Do  not  offer  trampoline  activities  or  have  trampolines  in  any  child  or  youth facilities.  FCC providers must ensure trampolines are not accessible to children/youth. 11.29.  National Affiliation and Participation in Regional and National Competitions.  YSF Manager must weigh the cost of national affiliation and participation of selected teams or players in national and regional competitions against the overall benefits received by the total group of children  involved  in  the  Sports  Program.  Use  of  YSF  funds  for  these  activities  is  approved  in advance by the AFS Flight Chief.  11.30.  Installation/Community  Leagues.  Installation  youth  leagues  may  choose  to  join  and play among off-installation leagues when the YSF league does not have sufficient teams.  11.30.1.  Use of appropriated funds may be  authorized to  pay for  group fees if approved in advance by the AFS Flight chief. YSF Manager must coordinate with off installation leagues to obtain mutual agreement on league rules and guidelines.   11.31.  YSF  Participation.  In all leagues (on/off installation), a minimum play rule is required for all youth regardless of ability.  Youth, 5-12 years of age, must be permitted to play at least half of every game. Only youth 11 years of age and up are permitted to participate in post season play (e.g. tournaments, play-offs, championship games).  11.31.1.  Care is taken to minimize risk of concussion and head injury. Youth below the age of 11 years are not permitted to participate in activities that result in significant or frequent collisions involving the head or neck (e.g. tackle football, boxing, wrestling).   AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 109 11.31.2.  Girls, 15 years of age and over, may participate in leagues for adult females when there  are  not  sufficient  numbers  of  females  to  offer  YSF  leagues  for  girls.

Gender-specific sports activities may be offered to facilitate maximum participation by male and females but participation in any league may not be restricted to one gender.  11.32.  Emphasis  on  Participation.  The  emphasis  in  YSF,  especially  for  the  younger  age groups,  will  be  on  skill  development,  enjoyment  and  maximum  participation.  The  intensity  of competition  for  youth  under  11  years  of  age  must  be  minimized  by  eliminating  all-star  teams, playoffs,  league  standing,  player  statistics,  purchase  of  full-dress  uniforms  and  post-season tournaments.  Parents  are  advised  prior  to  sign-up  that  the  sport  is  recreational  in  nature  with emphasis on skill development and fun and that competition is not the main objective of the YSF program.  11.33.  YSF  Parents.  Parents  of  children/youth  participating  in  youth  sports  are  required  to attend an annual YSF orientation conducted by YP personnel (may be offered one-on-one).  The orientation  should  include,  at  a  minimum:    program  philosophy;  health  and  safety;  code  of ethics;  bylaws;  role  of  the  staff;  role  of  the  volunteers;  role  of  officials  and  parents; transportation policies, positive guidance and appropriate touch.   11.33.1.  Parents  sign  the  NAYS  Parent  Association  for  Youth  Sports  Code  of  Ethics pledging  their  commitment  to  providing  an  enjoyable  experience,  as  well  as  the responsibility parents play in supporting the youth sport experience.   11.33.2.  All  teams  are  required  to  have  at  least  one  team/parent  meeting  each  season (separate from the required annual league orientation).    11.34.  Sport  Supplies  and  Equipment.  Equipment  and  supplies  are  age  appropriate,  safe  for use and must carry the  National  Operating Committee for Standards in  Athletic Equipment   or ASTM  approval  for  safety.    Equipment  designed  to  ensure  injury  reduction  for  participants  is used  for  each  YSF  activity  (e.g.  baseballs  designed  to  reduce  injuries,  soccer  shin  guards  and approved protective equipment in contact sports).  11.34.1.  Equipment will not be altered without permission from the manufacturer.   11.34.2.  Equipment  and  uniforms  must  be  purchased  in  accordance  with  NAF  and  APF purchasing  requirements.    Both  must  be  inventoried,  in  serviceable  condition  and  stored properly when not in use. Equipment must be inspected before and after the season.  11.35.  YSF  Storage.  YP  must  have  adequate  space  to  store  YSF  equipment  and  supplies  if team and individual sports are offered.

The YSF Manager observes each coach’s performance within the first month of the sport  season.    Coaches  must  be  able  to  present  evidence  of  competency  in  coaching  youth sports and must be judged by the YSF Manager to be among the most qualified to serve as youth  coaches.  Acceptable  evidence  for  determining  the  most  qualified  may  also  include annual re-certification in programs such as the National Youth Sports Coaches Association. YSF Manager shall provide coaches with an evaluation at the end of the season.   11.37.3.  The  YSF  Manager  must  develop  an  evaluation  program  to  identify  those  coaches who are able and willing to support the purposes of the YSF program. 11.37.4.  YSF  Manager  will  ensure  game  officials  are  trained  and  scheduled  to  supervise games. Practice games will be conducted to give officials hands-on experience.   11.37.5.  Sporting events and league games will be officiated by qualified officials trained on the  policies  of  YSF.  If  qualified  officials  are  not  available,  certification  clinics  should  be conducted for officials.  Officials may be contract personnel or volunteers. 11.37.6.  YSF  Manager  will  ensure  equipment  necessary  for  volunteer  officials  is  provided (e.g.  whistles,  balls,  strike  counters).  Paid  officials  will  be  responsible  for  their  own equipment. 11.37.7.  Youth sports coaches must have at least one other adult present (e.g. another coach, parent of a participating youth) when working with youth.   11.38.  Clinics.  YP provide adequate space, time, materials and qualified instructors to conduct clinics.   11.39.  Player  Selection  and  Team  Organization.  The  system  used  for  player  selection  must be as fair as possible to all teams and individual players and the process documented in step-by-step  written  instructions  to  league  administrators  and  coaches.  Written  information  on  this process  must  also  be  available  for  parents  at  their  request.  The  YSF  Manager  and  league administrators  must  be  present  during  skills  assessment  and  team  assignments  to  monitor  the process.  11.39.1.  Each coach must be furnished a roster of all players assigned to his or her team. The coach must have this roster at all scheduled games and must make it available to any league official  or  opposing  coach  upon  request.

A  written  system  is  in  place  for  league  and  team  division,  in  which  weight  and skills are assessed in establishing a fair and equal league for youth 11 years of age and up.   11.39.3.  Rotation  of  youth  into different  playing positions facilitates skill development  and is  consistent with  the purposes of  youth  sports. At  younger age levels  (10  years of age and under) youth should be rotated among positions during practices and game play.  11.40.  Playing  Rules.  Sport  specific  and  age  appropriate  rules  must  align  with  NAYS guidelines.  11.40.1.  The  YSF  Manager  authorizes  and  modifies  rules  for  sports  or  use  of  equipment where  such  changes  will  make  play  less  dangerous,  reduce  inappropriate  physical  demands on young players and make the sport more appropriate and enjoyable for young athletes.  11.40.2.  For younger age groups (ages 5 to 6 years of age), rules must allow for instruction to  occur  during  games  and  practices.  Emphasis  is  on  the  fundamental  skills  instead  of competition.   11.40.3.  Over-coaching  (e.g.  yelling,  criticizing  and  providing  extensive  direction)  during games or practices must not be permitted.   11.41.  Scheduling  Games.  Only  the  YSF  Manager  will  change,  cancel,  postpone,  or  alter playing  schedules.  Once  play  begins  the  head  official  will  make  the  determination.

Special  competitions,  tournament  games,  bowl  games  or other  competitions  between  installation  and  off-installation  leagues  must  be  scheduled  by  the YSF Manager. Rules governing the event will be covered in pre-season meetings.  11.44.  Program Awards.  Awards and recognition may be part of YSF.  Individual awards are for sportsmanship and team work at all age levels. Individual awards for superior play (e.g. most valuable  player,  best  hitter,  best  offensive  player,  high  scorer)  shall  be  permitted  only  in activities  for  youth  11  years  of  age  and  older.  Solicitation  by  any  individuals  or  groups associated with the YSF program to purchase "luxury" items or extra awards (e.g. warm-up suits, jackets, jerseys, sweat bands) is prohibited.  11.44.1.  Patches,  certificates  or  T-shirts  may  be  given  to  all  players  for  participation.  However, participants who are dismissed from a team for disciplinary reasons or those who resign  or  quit  before  the  end  of  a  season,  including  playoffs,  must  not  be  eligible  for recognition  unless  their  departure  is  related  to  the  transfer  or  retirement  of  their  parent  or their parent’s absence because of a prolonged TDY or deployment.  11.44.2.  Promises of special  activities, functions, awards or prizes may  not  be made to  the players, coaches, parents  or volunteers unless prior approval  is  given by the YSF Manager. 112 AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 Such  activities  do  not  include  team  parties  or  other  minor  functions  which  promote  team unity.  11.45.  Pre/Post  Safety  Inspections.  CYP  personnel  must  be  constantly  aware  of  and  address safety  hazards  and  possible  problems  within  all  YP  areas,  including  both  indoor  and  outdoor spaces.  (T-1) 11.45.1.  A  field  and  facility  inspection  is  conducted  prior  to  the  beginning  of  any  league sports by the installation Safety office.  Documentation must be kept on file.  The inspection should  take  place  approximately  one  month  before  the  season  or  activity  begins  to  ensure repairs can be completed before the first game or activity starts.  CYP personnel must check equipment prior to each season.  (T-1) 11.45.2.  Ongoing  daily  equipment  and  field/facility  safety  inspection  is  performed  and documented;  discrepancies  are  reported.    If  a  risk  to  participants  exists,  interim  safety precautions  shall  be  made  or  practices  and  games  should  be  cancelled  until  the  problem  is fixed.   11.45.3.  Coaches  perform  a  mandatory  pre-game  field/area  safety inspection  and immediately report any/all safety hazards and possible problems to the YP personnel prior to play.   11.45.4.  A  documented  post-season  or  post-activity  equipment  and  field/facility  safety inspection is  required to be completed by YP  personnel.   This  inspection should take place one  week  following  the  conclusion  of  the  activity    or  the  season  to  ensure  repairs  can  be scheduled for completion before the upcoming season’s games or activities start.   11.45.5.  A Work Order Logbook and copies of submitted work orders must be kept on file to provide  a  system  of  record  keeping  that  tracks  construction,  renovation  and  repairs.  Information  obtained  through  the  pre/post  season  inspections  should  be  used  to  identify budget requirements, such a future repairs, maintenance and replacement requirements.  11.46.  Environmental  and  Emergency  Conditions.  The  YSF  Manager  or  designee  must determine when outside activities should be curtailed due to inclement or severe weather in the area.   11.46.1.  Coaches  must  be  trained  to  know  how  to  protect  youth  from  severe  weather including protection during lightning storms.  Players must be encouraged to wear sunscreen and sunglasses on sunny days.  11.47.  CYP  Reporting  Requirements.  Child  and  Youth  Program  managers  will  ensure  the following reports are completed in a timely manner 11.47.1.  AF quarterly operational reports reflecting operational capacity and enrollment are reported  to  AF/A1SOC  quarterly.    Program  managers  and  flight  chiefs  are  to  ensure information is accurate and reflects current operations before certifying. 11.47.2.  An AF Form 1187, Youth Flight Accident Report, must be completed for any injury and any fatality in any CYP.  Injuries must also be recorded on AF Form 1023, Youth Flight Record of Injuries, within 24 hours of when they occur.  Injuries must be logged in order of time  and  date  of  injury.    Parents  must  be  notified  of  any  accident/incident  regarding  their child/youth.   AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 113 11.47.2.1.  AFS  Flight  Chief  forwards  AF  Form  3424,  Reportable  Incident  for  all accidents  and  incidents  which  require  medical  attention,  hospitalization  or  other involvement  of  medical  personnel,  security  forces  or  family  advocacy  to  include  FCC certificate  revocations,  reports  for  epidemic  diseases,  facility  closures,  lapses  in supervision, inappropriate guidance/touch, child abuse and neglect or death of a child to AFSVA/SVI  within  24  hours  of  the  incident.    Evaluate  CYP  reportable  incidents  for trends.  (T-1) 11.47.2.2.  The incident report includes documentation of required notification to parents, flight  chief,  squadron  commander,  Family  Advocacy  Program  office  when  applicable (e.g.  lapse  of  accountability,  inappropriate  guidance/touch,  suspected  child  abuse  and neglect) and the AFSVA/SVPY and AF/A1SOC offices.   11.47.2.3.  AFS Flight  Chief provides updates to  AFSVA/SVI as additional  information becomes available. 11.48.  Facility Closures.  Before closing any CYP facility, a request must be sent to AF/A1S at least 60 days prior to proposed closure.  Request must include the rationale and the alternative to be  used  in  place  of  the  activity.    Requests  or  notifications  are  not  required  for  temporary emergency closures or if the installation is closing permanently.  Reference AFI 34-101.  (T-1)   11.48.1.  CDC/SAC  must  keep  classrooms  at  or  near  full  capacity  to  maximize  the availability of child care.  Closed child care spaces must be noted on the AF CYP Quarterly Operations  Report  to  include:    number  of  spaces,  justification  for  closure  and  expected  re-opening date.  Prior to conversion of closed classrooms for any purpose other than child care (e.g. training room), AFSVA/SVPY is notified. 11.48.2.  Short-term  facility  closures  are  discouraged  except  in  the  case  of  extreme emergencies/unusual circumstances.   11.48.2.1.  When  an  emergency  or  natural  disaster  occurs  on  the  installation  or  in  the local  area,  the  installation  Commander  may  suspend  CYP  operations.  If  conditions permit,  continue  to  offer  the  program  to  support  employed  parents.  The  WG/CC  may authorize parents or other volunteers to supplement the staff on a short term basis in order to maintain ratios and food service during extreme emergencies. If implemented, a 1701 series  qualified  manager  must  provide  oversight  to  ensure  child  abuse  prevention measures  must  be  in  place  and  AFSVA/SVPY  and  AF/A1SOC  must  be  notified  within 24 hours.   (T-1)  114 AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 CHAPTER 12 SUPERVISION AND ACCOUNTABILITY 12.1.  Child/Youth Supervision.  Programs have systems in place to protect children/youth from harm, especially when they move from one place to another, use the restroom, participate in field trips and emergency situations.  CYP personnel ensure children/youth are supervised at all times, ratios  are  maintained  and  accountability  is  transferred  to  replacement  staff  members  before leaving the group. When conducting accountability, counts will be a “name to face” check.  12.1.1.  CYP personnel and FCC providers are aware of the activities of the entire group of children/youth even when dealing with a smaller group.  CYP personnel and FCC providers position themselves strategically and look around often to check on the whole group.  12.1.2.  A  system  is  in  place  to  keep  unauthorized  people  from  taking  children/youth  from the program.   12.1.3.  CYP  personnel  do  not  use  personal  electronic  devices  including,  but  not  limited  to cell phones and tablets when supervising children/youth.  12.1.4.  Staff  implements  program  protocols  for  reporting  and  responding  in  the  event  of  a lost or missing child/youth.  12.1.5.  Volunteers  and  persons  under  age  18  years  of  age  must  not  be  alone  with children/youth and may not be counted in the staff to child/youth ratio.   12.2.  Staff  Scheduling.  CYP  managers  will  ensure  staff  to  child/youth  ratios  are  followed under all circumstances.   12.2.1.  The  program  is  organized  and  staffed  to  minimize  the  number  of  groups,  teaching staff, and classroom transitions experienced by an individual child/youth during the day and program  year.   Every  attempt  is  made  to  maintain  continuity  of  relationships  between teaching staff and children among groups of children.  CDC/SAC managers should strive to schedule  the  same  staff  daily.  CDC  management  will  review  AF  Form  1930s  weekly  to assess  the  number  of  staff  transitions  in  each  room  and  implement  plans  to  address  rooms with frequent staff transitions.  12.2.2.  There  must  be  enough  trained  staff  to  support  the  program  when  regular  staff members are absent.  12.2.3.  When  CYP  teaching  staff  is  scheduled  to  work  with  children/youth  4  or  more consecutive  hours,  they  are  provided  15  minutes  away  from  children/youth  in  each  4  hour period.   12.3.  Field  Trips.  CYP  personnel  and  FCC  providers  will  complete  a  face  to  name  check  to ensure all children/youth listed on AF Form 1930 (or applicable form) are present before leaving, during and departing destinations.  12.3.1.  CYP  personnel  and FCC providers will check vehicles upon arriving and departing destinations to ensure children/youth are not left in vehicles.  When unloading, drivers must perform a physical check in and around the vehicle to include the last row of the van/bus.   AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 115 12.3.2.  CYP  children/youth  must  be  directly  supervised  during  field  trips.    An  exception may be made for youth 13 to 18 years of age to be unchaperoned for short periods of time on low-risk field trips (e.g. mall, skating rink).   In such cases, youth must check in at periodic intervals with CYP personnel.  12.3.3.  Children 5 years of age and under will wear apparel (e.g. shirt, wristbands, labels) to identify  program/facility  and  phone  number  in  case  the  child  is  lost.    To  protect  children’s identity, names will not be displayed. 12.3.4.  There  is  an  age-appropriate  plan  in  place  to  locate  children/youth  who  may  be separated  from  the  group  during  trips  away  from  the  facility.    Staff  and  volunteers  are provided training on the plan prior to field trips. 12.4.  Playground Supervision.  A system must be in place when children/youth must leave the group.   12.4.1.  CDC  playgrounds  must  have  at  least  two  personnel  on  the  playground  when children/youth are outside.   12.4.2.  CDC/SAC personnel must be positioned to adequately supervise children/youth at all times  to  include  high  risk  equipment  such  as  composite  climbing  structures  and  high  risk activities  to  ensure  children/youth  are  safe.    CDC/SAC  personnel  should  not  be  grouped together  in  one  area  in  order  to  ensure  adequate  coverage  of  the  entire  playground  while interacting with children and youth.    12.4.3.  Areas behind buildings or around corners must not be accessible to children/youth or is continually monitored by CYP personnel.  12.5.  CDC Supervision.  Each facility must have a supervisor in the facility at all times. A GS-05  or  NAF  equivalent  may  manage  the  facility  for  no  more  than  two  consecutive  hours;  three consecutive hours as long as there is CYP manager of a higher grade available on the installation to assist if necessary.  12.5.1.  In  the  absence  of  a  Director,  a  person  of  equivalent  grade  or  higher  who  possesses the 1701 series qualifications must provide daily oversight.   If not located within the CDC, this person must conduct daily visits and be available to provide immediate onsite assistance when managerial support is needed. 12.5.2.  At least two paid staff must be in the facility when children are present.   12.5.3.  Individuals who are employed as T&C Specialists should not be used more than 10 hours per week to provide facility supervision for any program  12.5.4.  If  the  part-day  program  is  being  operated  in  another  facility  (e.g.  chapel  or  youth center)  and  there  are  48  children  or  less  with  other  adults  in  the  facility,  a  GS-05  or  NAF equivalent (in pay and job responsibilities) supervisor may also be responsible for a ratio of children.  12.5.5.

The  remainder  of  the  required ratio may be achieved by use of adult volunteers.  If overnight trips involve male and female participants, special consideration must be given to the number, gender and assignment of the adult chaperones.  12.10.3.  In addition to meeting required ratios, there must be two adults per group for each trip/tour; at least one paid staff is present.  118 AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 12.10.4.  For water-related and other high risk  activities, the required ratio is  one paid  staff member for every eight youth. Children who may need more attention (e.g. non-swimmers) are closely monitored. 12.10.5.  Special  precautions  must  be  considered  when  offering  and  conducting  high-risk activities  for  youth,  such  as  gymnastics,  martial  arts,  swimming,  canoeing,  and  other activities, requiring considerable physical skill.  12.10.6.

Any child custody order, divorce decree limiting parental rights or other court document must be reviewed by the installation legal office for guidance regarding release authorization.   12.11.1.2.  Parents may call, email or fax an authorization if another adult other than the one listed on the AF Form 1181 is to pick up their child. 12.11.2.  Children/youth  will  not  be  released  to  any  individual  who  appears  to  be incapacitated  by  drug  or  alcohol  use  (e.g.  stumbling,  smells  of  alcohol).    Programs  are  to contact Security Forces for support.   12.12.  CDC  Accountability.  CDC parents  must sign their children in/out  at  the front  desk on AF  Form  1182  (or  comparable  electronic  system  that  has  been  approved  by  AFSVA/SVPY).  Parents must also sign children in/out on AF Form 1930 in the activity room when they drop off or pick up their child.     12.12.1.  Parents  should notify the CDC if their children will not  be in  attendance.  Parents shall be contacted by 0900 if children do not arrive for care.  Parents must also be contacted if  preschool-age  children  (who  attend  other  preschools)  do  not  arrive  as  expected  from school.   12.12.2.  Each child is under the care of a specific adult and the adult knows where the child is at all times.  CDC personnel must take AF Form 1930s when the group leaves the activity room  (e.g.  field  trips,  fire  evacuations,  outdoors,  other  classrooms).    When  returning  to  the classroom,  a  “face  to  name”  check  is  performed.    This  includes  returning  from  the AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 119 playground.  For extended trips away from the facility, children are readily identifiable and a method is in place to locate children who may be separated from the group.   12.12.3.  Administrative  personnel  will  visually  count  the  number  of  children  in  each  room and compare the count with AF Form 1930 and AF Form 1182 (or equivalent report).  Action is taken to determine discrepancy and account for all children.   12.12.3.1.  The same process will be utilized during evacuation drills.  12.12.3.2.  Management  will  periodically  verify  the  AF  Form  1930  with  the  AF  Form 1182 throughout the day to ensure all children in attendance are accurately recorded.   12.12.4.

SAC teaching staff will carry their AF Form 1930 on field trips or evacuation  drills.    Youth  not  participating  in  the  field  trip  and  remaining  in  the  facility  are accounted for on a separate AF Form 1930.   12.13.1.  SAC personnel have a system to ensure all SAC youth are picked up from school.  SAC  personnel  have  a  system  to  identify  youth  that  have  not  arrived  as  expected  and  to contact the parents, the school or a responsible adult listed on the AF Form 1181.  12.13.2.  Parents should notify the SAC if their  youth will not be in  attendance.  Parents or the  emergency  contact  are  contacted  when  youth  who  arrive  by  bus  or  by  walking  do  not arrive at the program when expected.   12.13.3.  Youth under 9 years of age are not permitted to sign themselves in/out of SAC and are not released to siblings under 14 years of age.     12.13.3.1.

A locator board may be used in SAC to limit the number of youth using a specific room  or  location  (playground,  gymnasium)  and  to  provide  accountability  for  child/youth whereabouts.  The  locator  board  should  not  prevent  youth  from  using  the  restroom  when necessary.   12.13.5.  Facility  counts  are  taken  hourly.    Designated  staff  will  verify  the  AF  Form  1930 with the number of youth in the facility/playground to ensure accountability of all youth. 12.14.  YP  Accountability.  Youth  sign  in  and  out  of  the  YP  facility  (separate  requirements apply to SAC).   12.14.1.  Youth  under  5  years  of  age,  participating  in  an  organized  activity  remain  under constant supervision of a parent/guardian or sibling 16 years of age or older.   12.14.2.

The  maximum  group  size  in  a  home  is  six  children  per  provider (including  the  provider’s  own  children  under  8  years  of  age)  and  no  more  than  two  children under 2 years of age.  Parents must use AF Form 3412 FCC Daily Sign In/Out Form (or use the required  state equivalent).  12.15.1.  Child  care  may  not  be  provided  overnight  unless  authorized  by  the  FCC Coordinator.  If overnight child care is provided, no more than three children (including the Provider’s own children under 8 years of age) are cared for in the home.   12.15.1.1.

If  the  provider  chooses  to  stay  awake  it  is  not  required  for  the  provider  to remain on the same story of the FCC home as the sleeping clients/children. However, the provider should limit the amount of time present in those areas of the FCC home (such as a basement or garage) where a fast-developing fire has more potential to block the path between the provider and the clients/children. 12.15.3.  During  overnight  care,  children/youth  must  sleep  within  sight  of  the  provider.  Children/youth may not sleep in the same bed with the provider or their household members.  12.15.4.  When  the  provider  is  providing  care,  other  children/youth  (e.g.  friends  of  the provider’s  children  under  8  years  of  age)  may  not  be  present  in  the  home  if  their  presence makes the provider responsible for more than the maximum number of children.  AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 121 12.15.5.  Providers  may  combine  their  households  of  children/youth  with  those  of  other providers and neighbors only for special occasions and for short periods of time.  12.15.6.

When  staffing  at  a  single  ratio, paragraph 13.7.3 applies.   AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 125 13.7.2.  In SAC and YP, at least two staff shall be present whenever youth are in the facility and at  least  one SAC/YP staff must have current,  complete and adjudicated with  suitability determination made on all required background checks.  13.7.3.  Closed  circuit  television  (CCTV)  surveillance  must  be  used  when  staff  work  alone with children/youth.    The staff working alone and the staff member monitoring the CCTV must  have  current,  complete  and  adjudicated  with  suitability  determination  made  on  all required  background  checks.      At  least  one  CCTV  monitor  must  be  set  on  the  room  and periodically observed while the other monitors continue to rotate through the facility.   The staff member who is observing the CCTV monitor may continue with other duties.     13.7.3.1.  In  emergency  staffing  situations  (e.g.  staff  without  completed  background checks that work alone), the staff member observing the monitor must not  perform any other  duties  (e.g.  answering  the  phone,  updating  files).    This  should  not  occur  on  a regular basis. 13.7.3.2.  If  there  is  no  CCTV,  staff  without  completed  background  checks  must  work with a staff member that has a completed background check. 13.7.4.  If  a  CYP  child  care  program  is  being  conducted  in  facility  other  than  a  designated child care facility (e.g. chapel), other adults must be in the building during the hours of child care  operation  and  CCTV  is  not  required.    Two  CYP  personnel  must  always  be  with  the children and at least one member must have a completed background check with a favorable suitability determination.   13.7.5.  Youth sports coaches must have at least one other adult present (e.g. another coach, parent of a participating youth) when working with youth.   13.7.6.  When youth are transported off the installation, a minimum of two adults must be in the  vehicle.    The  only  exception  to  this  policy  is  when  youth  are  transported  on  the installation and two or more vehicles are used. When on the installation, vehicles may travel in tandem with one adult in each vehicle. The vehicles must travel directly behind each other.  13.8.  Closed Circuit Television (CCTV).  CCTVs are a requirement for use in CDC/SAC and any  systems  purchased  after  publication  of  this  Instruction  must  have  video  recording capabilities.   13.8.1.  Properly functioning CCTVs must be installed in each activity room.  Cameras must be  positioned  to  limit  blind  spots.    CCTV  monitors  are  located  where  the  front  desk personnel can clearly view and regularly observe each room.   13.8.2.  Parents/guardians  should  be  notified  that  CCTV  surveillance  systems  are  in  use  in CYP facilities so that they are aware of its usage and that recordings may be made regarding the daily activities.    13.8.3.  In the spirit of openness and transparency, parents/guardians may come to CYP and view  their  child/youth  participating  in  events  in  real-time  on  the  CCTV  monitor  unless contraindicated by a Collective Bargaining  Agreement (CBA)  covering  CYP  employees, in which case, approval  for reviewing must be made through the Freedom  of  Information  Act (FOIA) Requestor Service Center and must include a review by the installation legal office.   13.8.4.  Once  CCTV  recordings  are  made,  the  recording  becomes  an  official  Government record.    Requests  by  parents/guardians  for  viewing  a  CCTV  recording  may  be  made  to  the 126 AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 CDC/SAC Director.  Parents/guardians should be informed that such requests to view CCTV recordings will be acted upon as soon as the system has the capabilities and staffing and other factors permit. Oftentimes, such viewing may occur after the CDC has closed for the day.   13.8.5.  Obtaining copies of CCTV recordings, and requests for viewing a recording by DoD personnel other than a parent/guardian for non-DoD official purposes, should be submitted to the installation Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requestor Service Center.  All requests for obtaining a copy of a recording must also be reviewed by the installation legal office and approved by the appropriate release authority.   13.8.5.1.  CYP personnel do not have authority to make release determinations and must direct  the  requesting  individual  to  the  installation  FOIA  Requestor  Service  Center.  Release  determinations  in  these  cases  are  made  consistent  with  the  Privacy  Act  and,  as applicable, the FOIA.    13.8.5.2.  Unofficial release of video recordings may violate the FOIA, and Privacy Act (when a portion or complete of the video is maintain in a Privacy Act system of records), could  possibly  violate  the  privacy  rights  of  all  the  other  children/youth  and  CYP personnel in the recording. 13.8.6.  CCTV recordings should be maintained for 30 days unless there is a potential claim against  the  government  in  which  case  the  recording  shall  be  kept  for  6  months  or  until  the administrative claim is resolved or litigation is completed, whichever is later. 13.8.7.  In  addition  to  on-going  training  and  the  monitoring  of  the  direct  involvement  and personal  care  provided  by  CYP  personnel  and  volunteers,  CCTV  may  be  utilized  to  help monitor children/youth as well as to identify personnel training needs and other requirements necessary for maintaining a safe and secure environment. AFI34-144  2 MARCH 2016 127 Chapter 14 PROGRAM QUALITY 14.1.  Programming.  All CYP must offer intentional activities and experiences based on needs and interests of children/youth.  Programming is based on current knowledge of child and youth development, supports the unique challenges of military life and provides children/youth a safe place for exploration and a sense of belonging.  14.1.1.  Activities for children must be developmentally appropriate and emphasize concrete experiential  learning  that  promotes  developmental  gains  in  the  areas  of:  language,  social, physical,  emotional  and  cognitive.    Appropriate  activities  shall  support  curriculum  content areas  of  literacy,  mathematics,  social  studies,  science,  art,  music,  physical  education  and health.

All programs  will use the  AF CYP  Standard Weekly Planning  Form  for their respective age group/program.   14.4.1.  CYP teaching staff responsible for activity planning must be provided at a minimum one  hour  paid  planning  time  per  week  to  plan  and  consult  with  each  other.    Paid  planning time for CDC staff could be during children’s rest time if the children are one year of age or older and the majority of the children are resting. Additional planning time may be provided as needed to support individual program needs. 14.4.2.  Activity  plans  must that  support children/youth’s  learning  and  development  and  enhance  school  readiness.    Opportunities must  be  provided  that  support  success  at  various  skill  levels  and  incorporate  experiential learning opportunities.   intentional  goals  or  outcomes include 14.4.2.1.  Long term projects shall be planned for preschool children and youth.  Projects are  based  on  the  children/youth  needs  and  interests  and  may  extend  for  multiple  weeks depending on the age and interests of the participants.   14.4.2.2.  SAC/YP youth shall participate in planning, development, implementation and evaluation of programs and activities.   14.4.3.  The  Activity  Plan  is  reviewed  and  initialed  by  the  T&C  Specialist  prior  to implementation (with the exception of the FCC activity plan).  14.4.4.  Written  activity  plans  are  posted  in  activity  rooms/areas  available  to  staff  and substitutes and kept on file for one year.   14.5.  Daily  Schedule.  All  programs  use  a  daily  schedule  to  provide  children/youth  a  sense  of security,  independence  and  knowledge  of  what  they  can  expect  from  their  day.  The  daily schedule is followed, but is flexible to adjust to the needs and interests of children/youth.  14.5.1.  Each CDC activity room/FCC home will have a daily schedule posted.  The schedule will include: 14.5.1.1.  Outdoor time. 14.5.1.2.  Individual/small group/large group opportunities. 14.5.1.3.  Balance of child/youth initiated/adult initiated activities. 14.5.1.4.

Any  behavior  that  interferes  with  child/youth  learning, development  and  success  at  play,  is  harmful  to  themselves,  other  children  or  adults  or  puts  a child/youth at high risk for social problems or school failure.  A support plan must be developed when  children/youth  display  a  pattern  of  behaviors  that  put  themselves  or  others  at  risk.    The plan shall include:    14.11.1.  A  variety  of  positive  guidance  strategies  which  build  relationships  between  the child/youth,  staff  and  family,  reduce  the  need  for  conflict  and  teach  children/youth  to  be successful in their relationships with others.   14.11.2.  CYP personnel, FCC provider, specified volunteers and contractors must respond in developmentally appropriate ways to  child/youth  negative  emotions  and feelings of hurt by providing comfort, support and assistance.  14.11.3.  Managers and  T&C Specialists must  increase observations and   debriefs and offer parent  conferences  to  facilitate  successful  implementation  of  the  plan,  processes  and strategies.  Managers and T&C Specialists may obtain outside resources to provide additional support such as the Military Family Life Consultant (MFLC), Kids Included Together (KIT), SLO, Exceptional  Family  Member Program  (EFMP) Coordinators and the installation CYP Medical Advisor.  14.12.  Conflict  Resolution  Skills.  CYP  personnel  and  FCC  providers  model  and  use  conflict resolution skills  to negotiate and resolve differences when conflict arises.  14.12.1.  CYP  personnel and FCC providers engage children/youth  in setting and  enforcing classroom rules.  14.13.  Developmental  Screening/Observations/Assessment.

Written permission must be obtained from the parent prior to sharing information.  15.6.2.  Due  diligence  and  best  efforts  are  required  by  all  involved  to  consider  possible modifications  or  adjustments  that  can  reasonably  be  made  to  programs,  staffing  and/or facilities  in  order  to  accommodate  a  child  or  youth  with  disabilities  or  special  needs.  However,  such  accommodations  should  not  fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of  the  service, program, or activity.  If reasonable accommodations cannot be met, installations must consult with AFSVA/SVPY to explore additional alternate accommodations.  Additionally, programs should  contact  their  installation  Legal  office  for  guidance  and  assistance  in  exploring reasonable accommodations and options as well as to assure compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and other applicable public laws prohibiting discrimination based on disability.  Disapproval of care should only be considered if other options are unavailable and requires coordination from AFSVA/SVPY prior to parent/guardian notification.  (T-1) 15.7.  Support  Specialists.  Support  specialists  are  permitted  to  provide  services  within  CYP with parental permission.
