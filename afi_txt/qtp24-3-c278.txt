Straight Line Backing.  Back through and out of the alley/lane, without touching boundary lines or cones on either side of the alley/lane.  Figure A4.1.  Straight Line Backing.       A4.2.   Offset Backing – Left/Right.  Adjust boundary depending on vehicle.  At the start of the exercise, the vehicle is positioned in the right lane; the operator moves straight ahead and stops at the outer barrier lines/cones.  The operator then backs the vehicle so it is positioned in the left lane and continues backing until the vehicle has cleared the forward set of cones with the front of the vehicle.  A4.2.1.   The  outer  and  side  boundaries  are  containment  boundaries  and  are  used  as  a reference only.  A4.2.2.   The opposite lane is used for Offset Back-Right.  The driver drives straight in the left lane to the outer barrier, and backs the vehicle so it is positioned in the right lane and continues to back the vehicle until the front vehicle has cleared the forward set of cones.  Figure A4.2.  Offset Backing – Left/Right.    A4.3.   Left/Right  Turn  (4).    Include  turns  at  traffic  lights,  stop  signs,  and  uncontrolled intersections.  The turns should range from easy to somewhat difficult for commercial vehicles.  The operator should try to get a mixture of types of intersections so that they vary in complexity.  Try to include turns that have multiple approach lanes and a single approach lane turning onto a street with multiple lanes.  A4.4.   Lane Change (2).  Include two lane changes maneuvers.  Each maneuver must include a lane change to the left and to the right.  The lane change maneuvers can be conducted during any portion of the road test.  The locations should be suitable for conducting lane changes and allow enough time for the driver to complete each lane change.  The lane change maneuvers may be conducted during the expressway, urban or rural driving sections provided a sufficient amount of driving distance is available.  A4.5.   Intersections.  Select two through intersection and two intersections where a stop has to be made (a stop sign is preferred.  These intersections should not be included in the urban section.  One of the stop intersections should not be controlled by traffic lights (2- or 4-way stop).    A4.6.   Railroad Crossing.  Try to have an uncontrolled (no lights or stop arms) railroad crossing.  The crossing should have enough sight distance to see if the operator checks left and right while approaching the crossing.  The operator’s looking left and right down the track will often be the only way to tell if the operator has noticed the crossing.  A4.6.1.   If there is no railroad crossing in the testing area, do the following.  Find a lightly traveled street or road that contains a landmark which the observer will point out to the operator.  Tell the operator to pretend that there is a railroad crossing at that point.  The landmark can be an intersection, an entrance to the road, or a road sign or billboard.  Give the operator instructions out of traffic, while the vehicle is stopped.  A4.7.  Expressway.  A4.7.1. The operator should use a roadway segment in or close to the testing area.  If there is no roadway, freeway, etc., then use a road or highway with high speeds.  A4.7.2. The  roadway  section  should  be  a  four-lane  controlled  access  highway  such  as  an interstate highway.  The section should start with a conventional ramp entrance and end with a conventional ramp exit.  One set of lane change maneuvers may be conducted within this section.  A4.7.3. If using a rural highway section, it should be at least two miles long.  (In general, look for  an  area  of  rural  road  that  provides  driving  challenges  similar  to  those  found  on  an expressway.)  One set of lane change maneuvers may be conducted within this section.     Attachment 5  SEVEN-STEP INSPECTION PROCESS  Figure A5.1.  Seven-Step Inspection Process.  2.

Ammeter/voltmeter. Mirrors. Tires. If the trainee sees, hears, smells, or feels anything that might mean trouble, he/she should check it out. Safety inspection. Document any discrepancy on AF Form 1800.  Sign-off AF Form 1800 to signify accomplishment of inspection.    Figure A5.2.  Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes System.

Final Air Brake Check • • o o o o • • o o o o • o o o o o • o Procedure Check air compressor drive belt condition and tightness (if compressor is belt driven). Check manual slack adjusters on S-cam brakes.  Note:  Vehicles with automatic slack adjustors still must be checked. Park on level ground and chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes so the operator can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that it can be reached. Check slack adjuster, more than 1-inch indicates adjustments required (vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time.   o If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate. • o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 o o o o • psi). Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure. Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Compressor should cut-in at manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure. Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. Wait for normal air pressure. Release the parking brake. Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action. o o • o o o o o o   • • • •
