Additionally,  roles  for  Program  Managers were clarified. Section A—General Information 1.  Air Force Goal.  To prevent unauthorized activation of critical functions, as specified in AFI 91-107,  Design,  Evaluation,  Troubleshooting,  and  Maintenance  Criteria  for  Nuclear  Weapon Systems, the Air Force develops  positive measures to  protect  against inherent  risks and threats, and to ensure components are compatible with the assembled nuclear weapon system. 1.1.  A  critical  component  is  a  component  of  a  nuclear  weapon  system  that  if  bypassed, activated,  or  tampered  with  could  result  in  or  contribute  to  deliberate  or  inadvertent authorizing,  pre-arming,  arming,  or  launch  of  a  combat  delivery  vehicle  carrying  a  nuclear weapon or the targeting of a nuclear weapon to other than its planned target. Section B—General Responsibilities 2.  Air  Force  Chief  of  Safety  (AF/SE).  AF/SE  establishes  requirements  to  designate,  certify and manage the critical component process and directs AFSEC/SEW to: 2.1.  Designate critical components (when not designated by the AF Nuclear Weapon System Surety Group (NWSSG)). 2.2.  Designate  split-handling  or  split-knowledge  procedures,  as  defined  in  AFI  91-101,  Air Force  Nuclear  Weapons  Surety  Program,  for  critical  components  if  not  previously determined  or  if  procedures  proposed  or  in  use  are  determined  by  AFSEC/SEW  to  be inadequate (when not designated by the AF NWSSG). 2.3.  Approve  Operational  Certification  (OPCERT)/Operational  Decertification  (DECERT) and procedural controls for critical components. 2.4.  Approve vaults and containers used to store critical components (see paragraph 12). 2.5.  Nuclear  safety  design  certify  Tamper  Detection  Indicators  (TDI)  per  AFI  91-103,  Air Force  Nuclear  Safety  Design  Certification  Program,  and  approve  their  use  to  protect  the certification status of critical components. 3.  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) (SAF/AQ): 3.1.  Identifies Program Manager responsibilities for critical components 3.2.  Ensures  Program  Managers  for  nuclear  capable/certified  weapon  systems  and  nuclear certified mission support items develop OPCERT and DECERT procedures. 4.  Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Commander will: 4.1.  Ensure that the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) commander will: 4.1.1.  Support nuclear certification requirements IAW AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program. AFI91-105  22 JULY 2016 3 4.1.2.  Ensure TDI and designated critical components are nuclear safety design certified IAW AFI 63-125, as appropriate. 4.1.2.1.  Ensure Nuclear Certification Impact Statements (NCIS) affecting designated critical  components  and  TDIs  are  coordinated  with  AFSEC/SEW  to  determine appropriate nuclear safety design certification requirements. 4.1.2.2.  Ensure  designated  critical  components  are  properly  identified  in  the  Master Nuclear Certification List (MNCL). 5.  Air  Force  Nuclear  Weapon  System  Surety  Group.  Per  DoDM  3150.02,  DoD  Nuclear Weapon  System  Safety  Program  Manual,  the  AF  NWSSG  reviews  nuclear  weapon  system designs  and  operations  to  determine  if  they  meet  the  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  Nuclear Weapon System Safety Standards. It proposes safety rules and recommends changes to improve nuclear weapon system surety. Specifically, the AF NWSSG: 5.1.  Designates  which  nuclear  weapon  system  components  are  critical  and  reviews  those designated by AF/SE. 5.2.  Designates  which  nuclear  certified  critical  components  require  split-handling  or  split- knowledge procedures and reviews those designated by AF/SE. 5.3.  Designates  split-handling  or  split-knowledge  procedures  during  the  lifecycle  of  the nuclear weapon system critical component and reviews those designated by AF/SE. 5.4.  Reviews and, if required, updates weapon system safety rules. 6.  Program  Managers.  AFI 63-125 provides a  process  for establishing  and administering the nuclear  certification  of  Air  Force  nuclear  systems  throughout  their  life  cycles.  The  Program Manager responsible for procuring or modifying a nuclear weapon system must: 6.1.  Notify  AFSEC/SEW  of  weapon  system  modifications  that  impact  current  critical components by submitting a NCIS to the AFNWC/NTS (Surety and Certification Division). The NCIS IAW AFI 63-125 provides a functional description of the proposed new system or modification  and  includes  the  System  Program  Manager’s  evaluation  of  its  potential  for nuclear certification impact. Further NCIS guidance is provided in AFI 63-125. 6.2.  Recommend items for critical component status to AFSEC/SEW. 6.3.  Recommend  OPCERT  and  DECERT  concepts  and  Technical  Order  procedures  of critical  components  to  AFSEC/SEW.  Recommend  decertification  of  critical  components when component is no longer part of an assembled nuclear weapon system. 7.  Commanders of Organizations Possessing Critical Components will: 7.1.  Implement split-handling and split-knowledge control procedures. (T-0). 7.2.  Operationally certify critical components IAW AFI 91-103 and as required by approved Technical Order procedures. 7.3.  Decertify  critical  components  according  to  AFI  91-103  and  associated  Technical Orders. 7.4.  Control certified critical components according to Section D of this Instruction. (T-0). 4 AFI91-105  22 JULY 2016 Section C—Designating and Marking Critical Components 8.  Designating  Critical  Components.  Critical  components  must  receive  nuclear  certification IAW AFI 63-125 and be listed in the MNCL. 8.1.  Items  designated  as  a  critical  component  will  be  clearly  identified  as  a  critical component in the MNCL. 8.2.  The  National  Security  Agency  (NSA)  may  request  critical  component  designation  for NSA-produced  software  and  hardware  used  with  a  nuclear  weapon  or  nuclear  weapon system.  The  NSA-provided  software  and  hardware  items  receive  certification  equal  to  that provided by the Air Force and therefore do not need additional Air Force design certification. 9.  Marking Critical Components.  Organizations possessing critical components will: 9.1.  Affix  the  label  or  tag  to  the  outside  of  the  critical  component  and  the  component’s shipping container. (T-0). ICBM code components will be tagged  while outside of shipping containers. (T-0). 9.2.  Cover the label or tag when the component is not certified for operational use. (T-0). 9.3.  Ensure  no  external  markings  are  made  which  identify  areas,  facilities,  aircraft,  or equipment as containing critical components (e.g. adding identifying paint stripe). (T-0). Section D—Controlling Critical Components 10.  Two-Person Concept.  The Two-Person Concept (TPC), as defined in AFI 91-101, protects a part of each critical component’s life cycle. This minimizes the possibility that an unauthorized or  inadvertent  act  could  degrade  the  nuclear  surety  of  a  nuclear  weapon  or  nuclear  weapon system. TPC for a critical component may begin at the time of production and continue until the critical component’s destruction or may occur during any interim period. Complete the following tasks: 10.1.  Handle and control the component following the guidelines for operationally certified critical components in AFI 91-104, Nuclear Surety Tamper Control and Detection Programs. (T-0). 10.2.  Keep  a  code  component  or  device  under  TPC  or  store  it  according  to  the  methods described  in  paragraph  12  when  an  operational  code  that  cannot  be  overwritten  passes through it. (T-0). TPC applies if the code component or device has no operational DECERT procedure  and  continues  until  all  embedded  codes  are  superseded  or  IAW  controlling authority,  per  Emergency  Action  Procedures-Strategic  (EAP-STRAT),  Volume  16,  ICBM Code Component Control Policy and Procedures. 11.  Shipping  Requirements.  If  using  a  TPC  team  or  NSA-approved  TDIs  to  protect  the certification  status,  you  will  use  the  DoD  Courier  Service  to  transport  operationally  certified critical components. (T-0). 12.  Storage Requirements.  These storage requirements apply to certified critical components. Decertified critical components require storage units to meet security classification requirements, IAW CG-W-5, Joint DoE/DoD Nuclear Weapons Classification Policy Guide. (T-0). AFI91-105  22 JULY 2016 5 12.1.  Operational  Use  of  Critical  Components.  Protect  certified  critical  components  in operational use by keeping them under TPC or in a storage facility as specified in paragraph 12.2. (T-0). 12.2.  Use  one  of  the  following  methods  to  store  certified  critical  components  that  are  not under TPC. 12.2.1.  Method 1. Store components in an approved reinforced concrete vault. (T-0). 12.2.2.  Method 2. Store components in an approved storage container. (T-0). 12.2.3.  Method 3. Protect components with TDIs approved IAW AFI 91-104. 12.3.  Apply the following for methods 1 and 2. 12.3.1.  Store the component in a no-lone zone. (T-0). 12.3.2.  Secure  every  entrance  to  the  no-lone  zone  with  two  General  Services Administration  (GSA)  medium-security  locks  ensuring  no  individual  can  open  both locks, or a GSA approved combination lock which requires two separate combinations to be dialed out for it to be unlocked ensuring no lone individual can gain access to the no-lone zone. (T-0). 12.3.3.  Use  volumetric  motion  detectors  and  door  detectors  with  capability  to  cover  all facility openings greater than 96 square inches; all detectors must report independently to a remote, continuously staffed location. (T-0). 12.3.3.1.  Incorporate a line supervision scheme within the alarm reporting circuits for the storage area that detects tampering and reports it to the remote monitoring facility. (T-0). 12.3.3.2.  Keep at least one person focused on security functions at the alarm monitor location. (T-0). 12.4.  Unless  they  are  protected  by  method  3,  keep  temporarily  stored  certified  critical components  (e.g.  uncoded  Minuteman  missile  guidance  sets  remaining  overnight  at  missile alert  facilities)  in  a  no-lone  zone.  Protect  the  components  as  their  classification  warrants.  “See  EAP-STRAT  Volume  16,  Chapter  4,  paragraph  7,  for  procedures  concerning  code components.” (T-0).  ANDREW M.
