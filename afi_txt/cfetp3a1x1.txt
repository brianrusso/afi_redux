This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP ensures individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at appropriate points in their career.  It provides a clear career path to success and instills rigor in all aspects of career field training.  NOTE:  Civilians and military filling associated positions may use Part II to support duty position qualification training. 2.  The CFETP consists of two parts.  Supervisors plan, manage, and control training within the specialty using both parts of the plan. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how to use the plan.  Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path.  Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other).  Section D indicates resource constraints (i.e. funds, manpower, equipment, facilities).  Section E identifies transition training plans for the 3A1X1 career field. 2.2.  Part II includes specific training standards and resources.  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, and technical references to support training.  Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducts training, core task and correspondence course requirements.  Section B is not used for this specialty.  Section C identifies available support materials.  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training, including both mandatory and optional courses.  Section E identifies Major Command (MAJCOM) unique training requirements to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  Supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. 3.  Use of the guidance provided in this CFETP provides the foundation for effective and efficient training for individuals in this career field at the appropriate points in their careers.

This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFM), MAJCOM FMs, commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS-specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  This training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill level.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airman.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP serves several purposes--some are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career. 1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process. 2.  Usage.  The plan will be used by MAJCOM FMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MAJCOM FMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into the plan. 2.3.  81 TRSS/TSQ Qualification Training Flight (Q-Flight) personnel develop training packages (AFJQSs/AFQTPs) based on requests submitted by the MAJCOMs and according to the priorities assigned by the CFM. 2.4.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 10  2.5.  Submit recommended CFETP corrections to the 81 TRSS Q-Flight Customer Service Desk at 81 TRSS/TSQS, 601 D Street, Keesler AFB MS 39534-2235 or call DSN 597-3343.

Measurement.  Each objective is indicated as follows:  W indicates task or subject knowledge which is measured using a written test; PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check; and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a progress check. 7.  Standard.  The standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 8.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. Section C - Support Materials 9.
