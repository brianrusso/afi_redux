This checklist complements AFI 11-2C-130J-V3, Operations Procedures, and is printed on standard 8 ½” x 11” bond paper, and trimmed to fit the standard plastic aircrew checklist binders. This checklist is intended to provide MAFFS certified crewmembers quick reference to procedures required for the safe execution of MAFFS ground and flight operations.   All MAFFS certified C-130J pilots will carry this annex. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate chain of command.
