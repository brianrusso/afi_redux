This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive training document that identifies life-cycle training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task requirements for the Airfield Operations Officer specialty.  2. The CFETP consists of two parts used by supervisors and commanders to plan and manage training within the career field.  2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how to use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge and training); and Section D indicates resource constraints.  2.2. Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the course training standard and includes duties and tasks to support initial qualification training.   Section B identifies the training course index supervisors and commanders should use to determine resources available to support training.  Section C identifies available support material (Airfield  Operations  Management Qualification  Training  Package;  AOM  QTP).  Section D identifies MAJCOM unique requirements (there are currently none).  3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure Airfield Operations Officers receive effective  and efficient training at appropriate points in their career.  At unit level, supervisors and commanders will use Part I to identify, validate initial training and conduct follow-on training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  4 ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM).

This CFETP provides the information necessary for the AFCFM, MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), training management, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training that airfield operations officers should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  For purposes of this plan, training is divided into Initial Skills Training (IST), Mission Qualification Training (MQT), Continuation Training (CT), and Development Training (DT).  IST is Air Force Specialty (AFS) specific initial skills training.  IST is conducted by the 334th Training Squadron (334 TRS), Keesler AFB MS.  13M1s are awarded the Air Traffic Control occupational badge upon completion of IST.  MQT identifies qualifications and training requirements to become a 13M3.  MQT is conducted and facilitated at an individual’s first and follow-on AOF duty assignments.  CT is proficiency training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the  achievement of CMR.  2. Uses.  This plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels.  2.1. 334 TRS (AETC) training personnel will develop and revise formal training based  upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II.  They will also work with  the AFCFM to develop strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2. MFMs will ensure this training program is implemented IAW this CFETP and AFI       13-204v1, Airfield Operations Career Field Development.  MAJCOM-specific training to support this AFS must be identified in this plan.  2.3. Each 13MX officer will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  2.4. Student Training Report Card.  The AETC Form 156, Student Training Report, reports students’ performance during technical school training.  For information regarding training or the documentation of completed training contact the 334 TRS at DSN 597-5159.  2.5. Students will complete initial skills  training at Keesler AFB, MS.  The 334 TRS Air Traffic Control Training Flight manages the 13M1 IST Course.  Course content is based on the items in the CTS in Part II of this CFETP.    3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority for waiving requirements identified in this CFETP.  MAJCOM representatives and HQ AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on career field training requirements.  The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document by HQ AETC and MFMs to ensure its currency and accuracy.   7 Section B – Career Progression and Information  4. Specialty Description.  4.1.

Quality training and timely progression from the entry to qualified levels play an important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission.   Everyone involved in education and training must plan, manage and conduct an effective program.   The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career.  Figure 5.1 depicts typical duty positions in the 13M career field by skill level.  5.1. Entry (13M1):  AFSC 13M1 is awarded at time of selection to attend the initial skills training formal course at Keesler AFB, MS.  5.2. Intermediate (13M2):  This skill level is not used for this AFSC.  5.3. Qualified (13M3):  5.3.1. MQT will be administered by a 13M3 at the unit level and managed/facilitated by the owning MFM IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  If a 13M3 is not available to administer training at the unit, MAJCOM 13Ms may fulfill this requirement.  MQT at the first duty locations will include completion of:  5.3.1.1. One control position certification in either Tower or RAPCON (e.g. local control or approach control), and one assist “non-control” position in the opposite facility (i.e. flight data or approach assist [unless assigned to a tower only location]).  Proficiency will be maintained in those positions until reassignment.  Note:  13M officers will use “without prior experience” time limits to attain ATC position certifications specified in the appropriate position certification guides, unless an officer has previously earned a Special Experience Identifier (SEI) equivalent rating in the facility in which  9 they are training.  5.3.1.2. Airfield Management Operations Coordinator (AMOC) PCG.  5.3.1.3. The Airfield Operations Management Qualifications Training Package (AOM QTP).  Note: 13M officers have up to 24 months from IST course graduation to complete all MQT requirements.  Once MQT requirements are completed at the first assignment, 13M1 officers are considered CMR and are awarded the 13M3 AFSC.  5.3.2. Follow-on 13M3 MQT at subsequent AOF-level assignments consists of ATC position certifications and AM requirements.  These requirements will be validated by each MFM. Follow-on assignment MQT requirements are as follows:  Note: ATC and AM position certifications must be completed within 12 months of assignment.  5.3.2.1. Complete the local AM AF IMT 797 requirements (unless AM is contracted and without the ability to train 13Ms)  5.3.2.2. ATC “Assist” position certification (Flight Data or Approach Assist) in the most complex ATC facility if assigned to a complex or a “Flight Data” position certification if assigned to an AOF that operates a tower only facility.  5.4. Staff (13M4).  Airfield Operations officers are awarded the (4) skill level while assigned to a MAJCOM/HQ staff.  5.5.  Continuation Training.  CT begins following the completion of MQT and the attainment of CMR at the first AOF assignment.  Note:  MQT and CT requirements only apply to 13M officers assigned to AOF-level assignments.  Also, for ANG 13M officers, for training time limits, see the ANG supplement to the 13-204v1.  5.5.1.  The Airfield Manager’s PCG.  5.5.2.  Attend and complete the Advanced Airfield Manager Course at Keesler AFB, MS.  5.5.3.  Attend and complete the Military Airspace Management Course at Keesler AFB, MS.  5.6.
