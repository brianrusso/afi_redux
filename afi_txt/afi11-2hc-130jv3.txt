Send draft local operating procedures to ACC/A3JO for coordination. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 17 Chapter 2 COMMAND AND CONTROL 2.1.  General.  The  ACC  command  and  control  (C2)  system  is  based  on  the  principles  of centralized monitoring and decentralized control and execution.  The result is  a C2 mechanism which  keeps  the  ACC  Commander  (COMACC)  informed  of  the  current  status  of  ACC  forces while enabling the Wing  Commander  (WG/CC) or Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) to exercise control over day-to-day operations. 2.2.  Operational Control (OPCON).  ACC is designated as the controlling agency for assigned Air  Force  aircraft,  while  theater  commands  have  OPCON  of  theater-based  assets.    In  practice, responsibility  for  planning  and  executing  ACC  missions  is  routinely  delegated  to  the  WG  or OG/CC.  The WG/CC or OG/CC, in turn, exercises control of non-close-hold missions through the  command  post  supporting  the  wing.    In  the  event  that  assigned  forces  undergo  a  CHOP, responsibility  for  mission  monitoring  passes  from  the  wing  or  group  C2  facility  to  the  gaining command.    Changeover  is  accomplished  IAW  the  pertinent  Operational  Plan  (OPLAN), Operational Order (OPORD), or Deployment Order (DEPORD) or Execution Order (EXORD). NOTE:  For  certain  close-hold  activities,  security  considerations  may  compel  the  WG/CC  or OG/CC  to  shift  mission  monitoring  responsibilities  from  the  command  post  to  another  wing agency. The WG/CC or OG/CC will establish procedures for the responsible agency to monitor mission  progress  and  advise  the  MAJCOM/A3  and  Commander,  Air  Combat  Command (COMACC) as appropriate. (T-2). 2.3.  Mission Monitoring.  Except for selected close-hold missions, the ACC Command Center monitors all ACC aircraft that move to, from, or between Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS)  off-station  locations.    Key  components  of  the  ACC  C2  system  are  the  Global Command  and  Control  System  (GCCS)  and  the  various  C2  facilities  at  theater  and  wing locations.    When  aircraft  are  deployed  in  support  of  operations  and  exercises,  the  Command Center may obtain additional information from situation reports (SITREP) and Deployed Status Reports (DSR).  The following mission monitoring procedures primarily apply to missions that are not close-hold in nature and have not had operational control changed to another command. 2.3.1.  The  respective  unit  command  post  tracks  Continental  United  States  (CONUS) movements of their aircraft based on aircrew reports. 2.3.2.  Host wing command posts telephonically relay information on OCONUS movements of ACC aircraft to the ACC Command Center.  The host wing command posts receive their data directly from aircrew or via the enroute facility’s local command post. 2.3.3.  Mission commander or PIC flight reporting duties: 2.3.3.1.  Missions  at  Bases  with  a  C2  Facility.    At  least  30  minutes  prior  to  landing, mission  commanders,  PICs,  or  their  designated  crewmember  will  relay  the  following information to the applicable C2 facility: call signs, mission numbers, and estimated time of arrival (ETA), maintenance status, and additional service requirements. After landing, the  mission  commander  or  PIC  will  contact  the  C2  facility  with  ground  handling requirements  and  departure  information.  (T-2).    In  addition,  CONUS  based  crews operating OCONUS must keep their home station command posts appraised of all actual takeoff and landing times, projected takeoff times, and other related information.  (T-2).   18 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 Home station command posts relay the information to the ACC Command Center.  These actions keep COMACC apprised of the locations and status of OCONUS forces.  When forces CHOP to another theater commander, reporting is through theater C2 centers upon arrival in the assigned area of responsibility. 2.3.3.2.  Missions  at  Bases  without  a  C2  Facility.  Mission  commanders  or  PICs  will report,  as  soon  as  possible,  actual  takeoff  and  landing  times,  maintenance  status, projected  takeoff  times,  and  other  pertinent  data  to  the  host  wing  command  post  or command center. (T-2).  Possible methods of communicating this information include HF phone  patch,  satellite  communication  (SATCOM),  satellite  phone  (SATPHONE),  DSN, and commercial telephone.  Refer to the Flight Information Handbook, United States Air Force (USAF) High Frequency Single Side Band (HF/SSB) Airways and Command and Control Station section, for guidance on mission reporting. 2.3.3.2.1.  Accomplish  movement  reporting  when  crew  duties  and  safety  permit  but no later than 30 minutes after the event. (T-2).   2.3.3.2.2.  If  unable  to  contact  ACC  Command  Center    via  HF/SSB,  retain information for submission via voice to the controlling C2 center (CCC) when contact is reestablished. 2.3.3.2.3.  Restrict  HF  transmissions  to  operational  traffic,  i.e.,  movement  reporting, itinerary  revisions,  maintenance  status,  flight  plan  information,  weather  and/or aircraft emergencies, or other important flight information, as appropriate. 2.3.3.2.4.  If  experiencing  problems  complying  with  these  procedures,  report problems  to  the next CCC contacted.  The CCC transmits  the reporting problems  to the ACC Command Center. 2.3.3.3.  Enroute  Reporting.    Enroute  reports  are  not  required  unless  specified  in  an OPORD/OPLAN or other mission directive. 2.3.3.3.1.  Unless  shorter  flight  legs  dictate,  when  approximately  3  hours  from destination,  the  PIC  will  contact  the  destination,  CCC,  or  if  no  CCC  is  available, contact the ACC command center via HF radio. (T-2).  Upon initial contact, confirm your  arrival  message  has  been  received  and  update  your  ETA.    If  your  arrival message  has  been  received,  no  further  information  need  be  transmitted.    If  your arrival message has not been received, pass the following: 2.3.3.3.1.1.  Mission number. 2.3.3.3.1.2.  Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). 2.3.3.3.1.3.  Very Important Person (VIP) code.  Transmit VIP and honors code in accordance with (IAW) FLIP planning document.  Send the VIP code of each VIP on board. 2.3.3.3.2.  When  within  UHF/VHF  range,  the  PIC  will  contact  the  destination  CCC with the following information, unless previously transmitted. (T-2). 2.3.3.3.2.1.  Mission number. 2.3.3.3.2.2.  ETA. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 19 2.3.3.3.2.3.  Number of passengers. 2.3.3.3.2.4.

Aircraft  or  system  has  suspected  or  known  radiological contamination plus any additional servicing requirements. 2.3.3.3.3.  VIP Messages.  Airborne classified messages originated by VIP passengers may be transmitted at the discretion of the PIC. 2.3.3.4.  Close-Hold or Sensitive Missions.  C2 procedures for these missions are outlined in the tasking directive. 2.4.  Mission  Commander.  Designate  a  mission  commander  when  more  than  one  aircraft  or crew  is  deployed  away  from  home  station  for  training,  exercises,  or  other  operations.    The mission commander should be a field grade officer.  Mission commander duties include, but are not limited to: 2.4.1.  Briefing crews on local operating procedures. 2.4.2.  Coordinating with ATC, Guardian Angel (GA), Combat Control Team (CCT), Special Tactics  Squadron  (STS),  range  control,  users,  and  others  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the mission. 2.4.3.  Confirming  that  drop  zones  (DZ)  or  landing  zones  (LZ)  have  current  surveys  (when necessary). 2.4.4.  Ensuring  personnel  have  ample  and  adequate  billeting,  eating,  and  transportation arrangements. 2.4.5.  Providing maintenance personnel aircraft and fuel requirements. 2.4.6.  Submitting timely reports on aircraft movements (see paragraph 2.3.3.) 2.5.  Pilot In Command Responsibility and Authority.  The Flight Authorization designates a pilot in command (PIC) for all flights.  PICs are: 2.5.1.  In command of all persons on board the aircraft. 2.5.2.  Responsible for the welfare of their aircrew and passengers. 2.5.3.  Vested  with  the  authority  necessary  to  manage  their  crew  and  safely  accomplish  the mission. 20 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 2.5.4.  The final mission authority and makes decisions not specifically assigned to a higher authority. 2.5.5.  The final authority for accepting any waivers affecting the crew or mission. 2.5.6.  Charged  with  keeping  the  applicable  C2  or  executing  agencies  informed  of  mission progress. 2.5.7.  Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a mission commander (see paragraphs 2.3.3 and  2.4.) 2.6.  Mission  Clearance  Decision.  The  agency  with  OPCON  or  the  PIC  may  make  the  final decision  to  delay  a  mission  when,  in  the  opinion  of  either,  conditions  are  not  safe  to  start  or continue a mission.  Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC.  If the PIC refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or improved so  that  the  mission  can  operate  safely.  (T-2).      Do  not  alert  another  PIC  and  crew  to  take  the same mission under the same conditions. 2.6.1.  The commander with OPCON must authorize diverting or rerouting a mission, except in an emergency or when required by enroute or terminal weather conditions or facilities.  In the  event  of  an  emergency  or  weather-related  divert  or  reroute,  the  mission  commander  or PIC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible. (T-2). 2.6.1.1.  The  controlling  agency  directing  the  rerouting  or  diversion  is  responsible  for determining  if  destination  requirements  or  facilities  are  adequate  for  the  aircraft  and aircrew.  The PIC should verify that this is the case. 2.6.1.2.  The PIC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitations that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission. (T-2). 2.6.2.  When  directing  an  aircraft  to  an  alternate  airfield,  the  C2  center  provides  the  PIC enroute  weather,  existing  and  forecast  weather  for  the  alternate,  Notice  to  Airmen (NOTAM), and appropriate airfield information from the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR).  If the planned alternate becomes unsuitable while enroute, the PIC should coordinate with  the C2 center for other suitable alternates.  The C2 center coordinates with customs and ground service agencies to prepare for arrival.  The PIC is the final authority on selecting a suitable alternate. 2.7.  Civilian Law Enforcement Support.  It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD) to  cooperate with  civilian law enforcement  officials  to  the maximum  extent practical.   AFI 10-801,  Defesne  Support  of  Civil  Authorities,  incorporates  the  appropriate  directive  and  provides uniform  policies  and  procedures  to  be  followed  concerning  support  provided  to  federal,  state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies.  It establishes specific limitations and restrictions on the  use  of  Air  Force  personnel,  equipment,  facilities,  and  services  by  civilian  law  enforcement organizations.    Report  all  requests  for  assistance  and  coordinate  all  requests  from  civilian  law enforcement authorities through the appropriate C2 channels. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 21 Chapter 3 AIRCREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 3.1.  Aircrew  Qualification.  Each  aircrew  member  will  be  qualified  or  in  training  for qualification in that crew position, mission, and mission design series (MDS) aircraft to perform duties as a primary aircrew member. (T-2). 3.1.1.  Basic proficiency crewmembers may perform primary crew duties on any non-mission sortie and on unilateral training, joint training, and exercises mission sorties when receiving mission qualification training or evaluations under the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight  examiner  in  their  respective  crew  position.      NOTE:    Senior  leaders  who  complete  a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) or  orientation  for  a  Senior  Staff  Familiarization  flight  may  occupy  a  primary  crew  position when under direct instructor supervision. 3.1.2.  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)  crewmembers  may  perform  primary  crew  duties  on any unilateral training mission. For other missions, the unit commander must determine the readiness of each mission capable crewmember to perform duties. (T-3). 3.1.3.  Non-current or unqualified pilots may perform crew duties only on designated training or  evaluation  missions  under  the  supervision  of  a  qualified  instructor  pilot  (IP)  or  flight examiner  pilot.  Direct  IP  supervision  is  required  during  critical  phases  of  flight.  (T-2).  NOTE:  Critical phases of flight are defined as takeoff, approach and landing, and all tactical mission events. 3.1.4.  Other  non-current  or  unqualified  crewmembers  may  serve  as  a  primary  aircrew member  on  any  mission  under  the  direct  supervision  of  a  qualified  instructor  or  flight examiner.  Except as noted in Table 3.1, the student crewmember and the instructor or flight examiner fulfill the requirement for one primary position. 3.2.  Crew  Complement.  Units  must  comply  with  minimum  crew  complement  as  specified  in Table 3.1. (T-3).  Unit commanders may authorize reduced crew complements as noted in Table 3.1.  The waiver authority for any additional crew complement reductions, down to the minimum crew complement specified in the flight manual, is the OG/CC. Table 3.1.  HC-130J Crew Complement (T-2).

Both ACs must be qualified in all phases of the mission to be accomplished.  Transfer of PIC duties between qualified ACs will be briefed to the crew. 3.  A certified CSO or LM is required for AAR events.  4.  Instructor LM (IL) and one student are considered full mission complement on training sorties, except during HAAR when accomplishing simultaneous contacts. 5.  Only one LM is required for tactical training missions if any of the situations below apply: - Personnel or door bundle (less than 100 lbs) drops using only one paratroop door. - High altitude (up to 10,000’ Mean Sea Level (MSL) non-static line personnel are dropped from the ramp and   door, or only one paratroop door is opened. - CDS airdrops,  -  SATB or Dry Pass - HAAR, single hose operations. - Receiver Air to Air Refueling (AAR) 6.  When more than 40 passengers are on board the aircraft, two loadmasters (or 1 LM and 1 additional crew member) are required. Both loadmasters and/or additional crew member will remain in the cargo compartment for the sortie.   3.3.  Additional  Crewmembers supplemented. (ACM).  See  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management,  as 3.4.  Mission  Essential  Personnel  (MEP).  See  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management,  as supplemented. 3.5.  Interfly.  Interfly  is  the  exchange  and/or  substitution  of  aircrew  members  and/or  aircraft between  MAJCOMs  to  accomplish  flying  missions.  Normally,  interfly  should  be  limited  to specific  operations,  exercises,  or  special  circumstances,  but  may  be  used  to  relieve  short-term qualified manpower shortfalls. 3.5.1.  Unless specified in a MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM Memorandum of Agreement (MOA): 3.5.1.1.  Aircraft ownership cannot be transferred. 3.5.1.2.  The unit contolling the mission is responsible for publication and maintenance of the aircraft flight authorizations for each mission flown by the aircraft. 3.5.1.3.  Crewmembers will be mission qualified in HC-130J aircraft. (T-2).  Differences training may be required between different series aircraft.  See AFI 11-2HC-130JV1. 3.5.1.4.  Crewmembers will follow operational procedures defined in 11-2HC-130J VOL 3, AFTTP 3-1 and 3-3 HC-130, and the applicable technical orders for the MDS. (T-2). 3.5.1.5.  The MAJCOM with aircraft ownership will retain all flight  and ground mishap reporting responsibility. 3.5.2.  Approval Authority. 3.5.2.1.  The OG/CC is the approval authority for interfly on aircraft under the OG/CC’s control. 3.5.2.2.  Each  participating  MAJCOM/A3  must  approve  interfly  for  contingency operations. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 23 3.6.  Intrafly.  Intrafly  is  the  exchange  and/or  substitution  of  aircrew  members  from  separate units  under  the  same  MAJCOM  to  accomplish  flying  missions.    Normally,  intrafly  should  be used only to relieve short-term qualified manpower shortfalls. 3.6.1.  The OG/CC possessing the aircraft is the approval authority for intrafly between units. 3.6.2.  As a minimum, crewmembers will be qualified in HC-130J aircraft, as well as systems or  configuration  required  to  fly  the  aircraft  and/or  mission.  (T-2).    If  non-current,  comply with paragraphs 3.1.1,  3.1.2, and  3.1.3. 3.7.  Flight Duty Period, Crew Duty Period, and Crew Rest Restrictions.  See AFI 11-202V3 as  supplemented.    The  Flight  Duty  Period  (FDP)  falls  within  the  constraints  of  the  Crew  Duty Period (CDP).  The addition of CDP is intended for a basic crew to complete aircrew duties at the  aircraft  after  engine  shutdown  (e.g.  cargo  loading/offloading,  refueling,  etc.).      NOTE: Waiver authority for  paragraph  3.7 is  MAJCOM/A3 or deployed equivalent, unless otherwise noted. 3.7.1.  Flight  Duty  Period.    FDP  is  the  period  that  starts  when  an  aircrew  reports  for  a mission, briefing, or other official duty and ends when engines are shut down at the end of the mission, mission leg, or a series of missions. 3.7.1.1.  The  basic  FDP  is  16  hours  providing  no  mission  events,  helicopter  air-to-air refueling  (HAAR)  below  3,000  ft  AGL,  pilot  proficiency  training,  air  to  air  refueling (AAR) or functional check flights (FCF) are accomplished after 12 hours and no HAAR at  or  above  3,000  ft  AGL  are  accomplished  after  14  hours.    If  both  autopilots  are  not operational, it cannot be coupled to the flight director or its use is denied for more than 4 hours,  the  FDP  is  12  hours.    If  the  autopilot  fails  after  departure,  continue  to  the  next scheduled stop and then comply with the basic FDP limitations. 3.7.1.2.  The  augmented  FDP  is  20  hours  providing  no  mission  events,  HAAR  below 3,000 ft AGL, pilot proficiency training, AAR or FCFs are accomplished after 16 hours and  no  HAAR  at  or  above  3,000  ft  AGL  are  accomplished  after  18  hours.    If  the  both autopilots  are  not  operational,  it  cannot  be  coupled  to  the  flight  director,  or  its  use  is denied for more than 8 hours, the FDP is 16 hours. 3.7.1.2.1.  Crew changes should not be made immediately prior to performing critical phases  of  flight.    Normally,  30  minutes  prior  to  initiating  the  checklist  for  an  event allows the new crewmember time to acclimate.  EXCEPTION:  For training missions instructors plan and brief crew changes to safely maximize training objectives. 3.7.1.2.2.  Minimum in-flight crew rest facilities are 2 litters. 3.7.1.2.3.  FDP length is based on the mission to be performed.  For example, if the planned  mission  duration  is  15  hours  from  show  time  to  termination,  then  a  basic FDP  is  appropriate  even  if  the  crew  is  augmented.    Once  established,  a  basic  FDP cannot be changed to an augmented FDP, regardless of crew composition. 3.7.1.3.  Time spent traveling as a passenger on commercial or military transportation in excess of 4 hours counts as part of the duty period.  Official duty travel for personnel in official  military/civilian  status  counts  toward  the  duty  period.    For  further  information reference AFI 11-202V3 and MAJCOM Supplement. 24 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 3.7.2.  Crew  Duty  Period.    CDP  is  the  period  that  starts  when  an  aircrew  reports  for  a mission,  briefing,  or  other  official  duty  and  ends  at  the  completion  of  aircrew  duties  at  the aircraft.    Maximum  CDP  is  18  hours  for  a  basic  aircrew  and  22  hours  for  an  augmented aircrew. 3.7.3.  PICs  may  extend  the  FDP  and/or  CDP  by  up  to  2  hours  on  a  mission  in  progress.  PICs should attempt to comply with the waiver authority in AFI 11-202V3. If this option is exercised,  PICs  must  coordinate  with  C2  agencies  so  that  downstream  activities  are  not adversely affected.  (T-2). Units will not schedule missions to exceed the maximum FDP in this paragraph.  (T-2).      PICs should carefully  weigh all factors  affecting their crew before electing to extend the FDP and/or CDP. 3.8.  Alert  Duty.  See AFI 11-202V3 and MAJCOM Supplement.  Alert duty is defined as any period  during  which  an  alert  crew  is  on  call  to  perform  a  specific  mission.    Aircrew  will  be placed  into  crew  rest  prior  to  alert  status.  (T-2).      Upon  entering  crew  rest,  an  aircrew  will  be given an expected alert assumption time.  (T-2).   Alert aircrews must be prepared to respond at any time during the alert period. (T-2). 3.8.1.  Alert  personnel  are  those  required  to  be  on  duty  for  the  prompt  execution  of  the mission. Alert crews will be readily available in a location that allows the crew to meet the required time to launch from notification. (T-2).  Suitable facilities include adequate sleeping accommodations for the entire crew, unless at home station.  Publish flight authorizations for the alert crew to cover the entire alert duty period. 3.8.2.  The  alert  duty  period  begins  at  a  scheduled  time  determined  by  the  unit/mission commander.  Commanders  will  provide  aircrew  members  12  hours  crew  rest  prior  to  alert duty.  (T-3).  The unit/mission commander will determine the length of the alert period, not to exceed 72 hours. (T-3).  An alert period may be extended up to a maximum of 7 days with MAJCOM/A3  (or  deployed  equivalent)  approval  provided  aircrew  members  receive  a  24-hour  recovery  period  prior  to  the  next  alert.    Pre-departure  crew  rest  is  waived  for  flight surgeons  or  medical  technicians  who  are  on  alert  duty  for  urgent  Medical  Evacuation (MEDEVAC) missions. 3.8.3.  The FDP  will begin  when the  aircrew shows for flight  duties.  Crews may complete initial alert activities (e.g., transportation, briefing, preflight, engine run of their alert aircraft) without  starting  their  FDP.    This  time  should  not  exceed  3  hours.    If  the  aircrew  is  alerted while  performing  initial  alert  activities,  the  FDP  is  computed  from  the  time  crewmembers first arrived.  NOTE:  Alert response exercises that terminate prior to engine start do not start the FDP when they occur during normal waking hours. 3.8.3.1.  The  alert  crew  are  not  normally  used  as  a  preflight  or  engine  run  crew  for aircraft other than their  alert  aircraft.   Alert crews will not  perform other official duties (e.g., additional duties, commander’s call, safety meeting, etc.) within their alert period. (T-2). EXCEPTION:  During normal waking hours, alert aircrew may mission plan and accomplish updated pre-flights on their alert aircraft at the discretion of the PIC. 3.8.3.2.  A  daily  update  briefing  may  be  accomplished  without  starting  the  FDP.    This briefing  should  include  weather,  local  NOTAMS,  latest  Flight  Crew  Information  File (FCIF)  information,  special  instructions,  and  any  other  appropriate  items.    The  PIC determines which crewmembers attend the briefing. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 25 3.8.3.3.  An alert crew should not remain in alert status for more than 2 consecutive 72-hour alert periods. The alert crew will receive 12 hours of pre-mission crew rest between the  first  and  second  alert  periods.  (T-2).    Following  completion  of  the  second  72-hour alert period, the alert crew or crewmember will receive a minimum of 24 hours crew rest prior to reassuming alert status. (T-2). 3.8.4.  Flying the Alert Crew. 3.8.4.1.  If  the  alert  crew  is  launched  and  returns  with  FDP  remaining,  they  may  be launched  again  within  the  constraints  of  that  FDP.    Numerous  circumstances  may  arise that  affect  the  decision  to  replace  the  alert  crew  and  each  incident  is  evaluated  on  an individual basis. 3.8.4.2.  If the alert crew completes 12 consecutive hours of crew rest between flights or official duties within the 72 hour alert period, the previous FDP no longer applies and the cycle can be started  anew provided the  crew does not  remain on  alert  for more than 72 hours from their initial assumption of alert. 3.8.5.  Flying Crew Chief Work and Rest Plan.  The crew chief is responsible to the PIC. The PIC, in  conjunction with the enroute station  chief of maintenance, will determine how long the crew chief can safely perform aircraft recovery actions. (T-3).  The crew chief must have the opportunity to sleep 8 hours in each 24-hour period. (T-2).  See AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance. 3.9.  TDY Crew Rest/Post Deployment Stand Down. 3.9.1.  All primary/deadhead crewmembers departing on missions scheduled to be away from home  station  or  rotational  base  for  more  than  16  hours  or  recover  away  from  home  station should  be  notified  24  hours  before  reporting  for  the  mission.    The  first  12  hours  are  not considered  crew  rest,  but  are  designed  to  allow  crewmembers  time  to  resolve  personal affairs.   During these  first  12 hours, a crewmember may perform limited non-flying duties.  The second 12 hour period is inviolate crew rest. 3.9.2.  Post-mission  crew  rest  begins  upon  the  final  return  of  an  individual  to  home  station and  runs  continuously  until  completed.    Aircrew  must  complete  post-mission  crew  rest before  starting  the  12  hour  pre-departure  crew  rest  period  for  a  subsequent  mission.  (T-3).  Units  will  not  require  a  crewmember  to  get  immunizations,  engage  in  ground  training, perform standby or squadron duties, or perform any other activity that would encroach upon crew  rest.  (T-3).  Waiver  authority  for  post-mission  crew  rest  is  the  OG/CC  or  equivalent.  Waiver requests for post-mission crew rest are considered on a case by case basis only with the concurrence of the individual crewmember. 3.9.2.1.  Compute  post-mission  crew  rest  at  the  rate  of  1  hour  off  for  every  3  hours  of temporary duty (TDY), not to exceed 72 hours.  Note:  Not applicable to students while in formal schools listed in AFCAT 36-2223, USAF Formal Schools. 3.9.3.  Post-deployment stand down.  IAW MAJCOM guidance. 3.10.  Counter-Fatigue Management Program.  Refer to AFI 48-149,  Flight and Operational Medicine Program. 26 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 Chapter 4 AIRCRAFT OPERATING GUIDELINES 4.1.  Objectives.  The  objective  of  the  aircraft  maintenance  team  is  to  provide  an  aircraft  for launch with all equipment operational (Fully Mission Capable, FMC).  However, under specific circumstances,  some  missions  can  be  safely  operated  without  all  equipment  being  operational.  Using the following policies, the PIC is the final authority in determining an overall status of an aircraft.  (T-2)    The  PIC  will  ensure  a  detailed  explanation  of  the  discrepancy  is  entered  in  the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. 4.2.  Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy.  The MEL sets forth command policy regarding equipment/systems necessary to continue or complete missions after the aircraft is released from the responsible maintenance organization.  PICs must use/comply with the MEL Tables at 4.11. Equipment/systems not listed in Table 4.1 through Table 4.23 are considered required for flight without  exception.  (T-2).    This  list  cannot  anticipate  all  combinations  of  failures  and contingencies, and is not intended for continued operations, over an indefinite period, with failed or degraded equipment/systems. 4.2.1.  PIC  Responsibility.    PICs  should  account  for  the  possibility  of  additional  failures when  accepting  aircraft  with  inoperative  equipment/systems.    A  PIC  accepting  an  aircraft (one mission or mission segment) without an item or system does not commit that PIC (or a different PIC) to subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative. 4.2.2.  All  emergency  equipment  is  installed  unless  specifically  exempted  by  mission requirements/directives. 4.3.  Waiver  Protocol.  Waivers to operate with  degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-case basis.  The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical level of command.  A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a waiver through the appropriate C2 channels.  The PIC shall provide the C2 agency: 1) nature of request, 2)  individual  crew  member  qualifications,  3)  mission  leg(s)  requiring  the  waiver,  and  4)  the governing directive of waiver request to include volume, chapter, and paragraph. (T-2).   Initiate waiver requests as soon as possible.  MEL waiver authority is as follows: 4.3.1.  Training Missions.  SQ/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority. 4.3.2.  MAJCOM  Directed  Missions.    MAJCOM/A3  with  mission  execution  authority  for Regular  Air  Force,  AFRC,  or  ANG  units  flying  MAJCOM-directed  missions  (includes Operational Readiness Inspections).  Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency. 4.3.3.  Contingency  Missions.    COMAFFOR  (or  equivalent)  for  the  agency  with  C2,  if  not specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order. 4.3.4.  Other  than  MEL  Waivers.    Determine  governing  source  document  (i.e.  AFI,  Flight Manual, Maintenance Technical Order (T.O.), etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority.  Use C2 channels  to  notify  the  appropriate  waiver  authority.    Waivers  of  this  nature  may  require  an extended response time. 4.4.  Deviations.  If beyond C2 communication capability, or it is necessary to protect the crew or  aircraft  from  a  situation  not  covered  by  this  chapter  and  immediate  action  is  necessary,  the AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 27 PIC may deviate IAW paragraph 1.4.  Report deviations (without waiver) through channels to appropriate  MAJCOM/A3  within  48  hours.    Units  shall  collect  background  information  and submit a follow-up written report upon request. (T-2). 4.5.  Technical  Assistance.  The  PIC  may  request  technical  support  from  their  home  unit, MAJCOM staff, and maintenance representatives. 4.6.  One-Time  Flights.  An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that might be hazardous for continued use if the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another station. 4.6.1.  The  chief  of  maintenance,  senior  maintenance  officer,  or  chief  of  the  Air  Force Materiel Command (AFMC) repair team must first authorize the release. (T-2). 4.6.2.  After  maintenance  release,  contact  the  appropriate  authority  for  flight  authorization. NOTE:    One-time  flights  authorized  in  the  MEL  require  OG/CC  approval.    Any  one-time flight request not listed in the MEL requires MAJCOM/A3 approval. 4.6.3.  The  maintenance  release,  flight  authorization,  and  the  PICs  concurrence  are  all required before the aircraft can be flown to the specified destination. 4.7.  Fuel  System.  The  primary  concern  with  inoperative  fuel  boost  pumps  or  quantity indicators is fuel balance and wing loading.  Degraded operation is permissible; however, flight crews need to consider potentially trapped fuel and decreased range, should further degradation occur.    The  following  paragraphs  and  MEL  provide  guidelines  for  degraded  fuel  system operations under most circumstances. 4.7.1.  Crossfeed  Operations.    Begin  crossfeed  operation  when  the  symmetrically  opposite quantity indicator has decreased to 1,500 lbs (inboards) and 2,500 lbs (outboards) 4.7.1.1.  Engine  out  training  using  the  engine  corresponding  to  the  inoperative  indicator or its symmetrically opposite will not be conducted during tank to engine operation.  (T-2). 4.7.1.2.  Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow. 4.7.1.3.  Plan  to  terminate  local  training  flights  with  a  minimum  of  6,000 lbs  calculated main tank fuel. 4.7.2.  When an external tank indicator is inoperative and the tank cannot be visually checked empty due to foam modification, aircrew will comply with the following prior to flight:  (T-2). 4.7.2.1.  Check pressure with each pump in the external tank.  If no pressure is obtained, the tank is verified empty. 4.7.2.2.  If pressure is  obtained, ground transfer the fuel  from  the external  tank.  Defuel the external tank if unable to ground transfer. 4.7.2.3.  When unable to verify an external tank is empty prior to engine start, place the tank on crossfeed until no pressure is obtained.  Complete this prior to takeoff. 4.7.3.  For other than normal ground refueling/defueling operations and associated guidelines in this chapter, aircrew will not transfer fuel into or out of a main or external fuel tank with an  inoperative  indicator  or  its  symmetrical  tank  except  IAW  paragraph  4.7.2.2  and  the following: (T-2). 28 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 4.7.3.1.  Fuel  transfer into a main or external  tank with  an inoperative indicator may be accomplished during contingency or emergency fuel need situations.  All transfers, under these  conditions  require  more  than  one  crewmember  to  monitor  and  coordinate  the transfer to maintain lateral wing balance. 4.7.3.2.  A reliable source of known quantity transferred is available.  This source can be either internal aircraft operating fuel quantity indicators, or in-flight refueling tanker fuel onload data. 4.7.3.3.  Maintain  symmetrical  tanks  within  1,000  lbs  at  all  times.    If  small  amounts (4,000  lbs  or  less)  are  transferred,  then  transfer  up  to  1,000  lbs  into  the  tank  with  the inoperative  indicator  followed  by  an  equal  amount  into  the  tank(s)  with  operative indicator(s).  If large amounts of fuel are transferred, then transfer 1,000 lbs into the tank with  the  inoperative  indicator,  then  up  to  2,000  lbs  as  needed  into  the  tank(s)  with  the operative  indicators,  then  up  to  1,000  lbs  as  needed  into  the  tank  with  the  inoperative indicator to bring all tanks symmetrical, or continue up to 2,000 lbs as needed, repeating the cycle until desired fuel quantity and balance is achieved in applicable tanks. 4.7.4.  Fuel  may  be  transferred  from  main  or  external  tanks  with  inoperative  fuel  quantity indicators only if the receiver requires emergency fuel.  In this situation, aircrew will comply with the following procedures: (T-2). 4.7.4.1.  The fuel flow counter for the refueling pod being used is operational to track the amount of fuel transferred. 4.7.4.2.  Transfer from only one tank at a time. 4.7.4.3.  Transfer no more than 1,000 lbs at a time between the tanks with the inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank to monitor fuel balance. 4.8.  Landing  Gear  System.  If  a  landing  gear  malfunction  is  encountered,  PICs  will  make  a full-stop  landing.  (T-2).    The  discrepancy  is  corrected  prior  to  the  next  flight.    NOTE:  Gear indicator light failure does not constitute a gear malfunction. Check Soft Panel Gear indications to confirm landing gear position. EXCEPTION:  If repair capability does not exist and a positive determination  is  made  that  further  flight  can  be  accomplished,  with  the  gear  down  and  locked, the aircraft may be flown to a destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved from the down and locked position.  Required enroute stops are authorized. 4.9.  Navigation  Systems.    Chapter  11  lists  authorized  airspace  and  procedures  for  the  HC-130J.  Equipment listed in FLIP for compliance with appropriate airspace is mandatory.  Loss of any  component  before  airspace  entry  requires  return  to  a  station  with  maintenance  repair capability or continued flight with degraded systems when acknowledged and approved by ATC or filing via routes permitting operation with degraded equipment. 4.10.  Soft Panel Operations. 4.10.1.  For  partial  or  complete  hard  panel  failures,  aircrews  may  revert  to  soft  panel operations.  Normally, if a soft panel is selected due to hard panel failure, it should be used for the remainder of the flight.  Doing so mitigates the hazards associated with restoring hard panel  functionality  for  an  item  when  the  mission  computer  commanded-state  is  unknown.  Accomplishing the ENGINE SHUTDOWN and BEFORE LEAVING AIRPLANE checklists after  the  aircraft  is  parked  ensures  the  soft  panel  retains  control  of  the  particular  item AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 29 throughout  shutdown.    In  all  cases,  PICs  consider  the  increased  workload  associated  with using soft panels. 4.10.2.  Hard panel failures may be the result of a physical failure or loss of communication with the mission computer (MC), an aircraft “reboot” may recover hard panel functionality.  To determine if hard panel functionality can be regained, the PIC must follow the following procedures in sequential order: (T-2). 4.10.2.1.  Completely  power  down  when  accomplishing  the  BEFORE  LEAVING AIRPLANE checklist. 4.10.2.2.  Complete all checklist items in the POWER UP checklist.  Do not proceed past the  POWER  UP  checklist  until  it  can  be  determined  if  the  hard  panel  has  recovered.  Depending on the system effected (such as auxiliary power unit (APU), bleed air, landing gear,  etc.),  do  not  apply  bleed  air  or  hydraulics  until  hard  panel  functionality  can  be determined. 4.10.2.3.  To determine if a hard panel has recovered, confirm hard panel and soft panel selections/settings  are  identical.    Press  the  line  select  key  (LSK)  to  turn  the  soft  panel OFF.    If  a  CNI  “CHK  HARD  PNL”  or  a  referenced  hard  panel  fault  advisory,  caution, and  warning  system  (ACAWS)  message  (i.e.  “APU  PNL  FAULT”,  “DEF  SYS  PNL FAULT”, etc.) does not appear, press the “VERIFY OFF” LSK.  If feasible, check hard panel functionality. 4.10.2.4.  If  a  Communication/Navigation/Identification-Management  Unit  (CNI-MU) “CHK HARD PNL” or a referenced hard panel fault ACAWS message appears, the hard panel has not recovered.  The “CHK HARD PNL” message indicates there is a mismatch between  the  soft  panel  and  hard  panel  commands  to  the  MC  independent  of  physical switch positions.  Referenced hard panel fault messages are self-explanatory. 4.10.2.5.  If it is determined that the hard panel has not recovered, at the PIC’s discretion, the  mission  may  continue  to  a  station  supporting  a  repair  capability,  including  enroute stops.  Do not  reselect  the hard panel.    If  a flight  continues under the control of two or more soft panels, the PIC must obtain a waiver. (T-2). 4.10.3.  After  returning  to  home  station  or  repair  facility  with  a  hard  panel  malfunction, aircrew will shut down and turn the aircraft over to maintenance personnel. (T-2). 4.11.  MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. 4.11.1.  Installed - Number of components or systems installed. 4.11.1.1.  In some cases, a component can be controlled from either a conventional (hard) panel or from a CNI-MU display (soft panel).  Similarly, some indications can be viewed on  either  a  hard  panel  or  a  soft  panel.    Since  switch  functions  (or  indications)  may  be duplicated on each of the three CNI-MU displays, the number of switches (or indications) installed may not always be clear.  To clarify this condition, switches (or indications) are listed as ‘1’ in the installed column even when they are duplicated on a soft panel. 4.11.1.2.  Although the indications on each pilot’s Heads Down Displays (HDDs) can be repeated  on  more  than  one  HDD,  repetitions  of  data  in  excess  of  one  per  pilot  are  not relevant  for  flight  and  are  not  counted  in  this  MEL.    In  general,  the  flight  deck  is designed  to  provide  one  set  of  data  for  each  (in  addition  to  the  standby  instruments).  30 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 Thus,  for  most  HDD  indications,  the  “number  installed”  is  listed  as  “2”,  one  for  each pilot. 4.11.2.  Required - The minimum number (quantity) of items required for operation provided the conditions specified in the remarks or exception column are met. 4.11.2.1.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  when  the  item  is  a  switch  (or  indication)  which  is duplicated on a soft panel, the number required for dispatch may be satisfied by either the hard  panel  switch  (or  indication)  or  by  the  switch  (indication)  on  one  of  the  associated soft panels.  For HDD indications, the number required is ‘2’ if both pilots must have an indication, ‘1’ if only one pilot must have an indication and ‘0’ if neither pilot is required to  have  the  indication.    For  essential  flight  data  (heading,  airspeed,  attitude  and  when required,  navigation  data),  the  pilot’s  and  copilot’s  displays  must  have  independent sources. 4.11.3.  Remarks and Exceptions.  Some technical information and procedures are contained in  this column.  This  is  not  all-inclusive;  crewmembers shall  refer to  the flight  manual  and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc. Table 4.1.  Air Conditioning and Pressurization.

A  checklist  is  not  complete  until  all  items  have  been  accomplished.  Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and deviations specified in the flight manual, etc. are authorized.  Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations  may be added  to  the  checklists  (in  pencil).    Currency  of  notes  is  a  crewmember’s  responsibility.  Checklist  pages  may  be  carried  in  separate  binders  provided  checklist  integrity  is  not compromised. 5.1.1.  Checklist  Inserts.    The  only  pages  (or  inserts)  authorized  in  checklist  binders  are  C-130  series  T.O.  aircrew  checklists,  ACC  approved  checklists,  briefing  guides  and  unit approved information guides IAW AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program.  The inserts should be placed at the end of the appropriate checklist or in an in-flight guide.  Units must have  a  POC  on  all  checklist  inserts.  (T-2).    Units  may  construct  locally  approved  in-flight guides using AF Form 4124, Flight Crew Information Guide. 5.2.  Duty  Station.  IAW  Crew  at  Stations  guidance  and  Controlled  Cockpit  Rest  guidance  in AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules. 5.2.1.  Combat Systems Operator (CSO) Station.  The PIC may allow individuals to occupy the CSO station, when unoccupied, as long as their presence does not hinder the performance of the crew.  Qualified crewmembers, or unqualified crewmembers under the supervision of an instructor, may perform tasks assigned by the PIC. 5.3.  Flight Deck Entry.  PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight deck during  non-critical  phases  of  flight.    Limit  the  number  of  persons  on  the  flight  deck  to  the minimum  required for mission accomplishment.   The PIC will not  allow this to  exceed nine at any time (unless otherwise specified in a MAJCOM supplement to this AFI). (T-2).  Passengers and observers will not be permitted access to either pilot position. (T-2). 5.4.  Takeoff and Landing Policy.  An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left or the right  seat  during  all takeoffs and landings.  (T-2).  The designated PIC is  not  required to occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission. 5.4.1.  An AC or higher will make all takeoffs & landings during aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance or in the judgment of the AC it would be less safe. (T-2) 5.4.2.  PICs with less than 100 PAA hours since AC certification. If the pilot in the other seat is  not  an  AC  or  above,  a  new  AC  will  make  all  takeoffs  and  landings  under  any  of  the following conditions: (T-2). 5.4.2.1.  Ceiling/visibility less than 300 feet and/or RVR 4000’ (3/4 SM visibility). 5.4.2.2.  RCR less than 12. 5.4.2.3.  Crosswind component greater than 15 knots. 5.4.3.  NVG  Airland  current  and  qualified  pilots  may  accomplish  NVG  landings  (non-short field/non-max  effort)  from  the  left  or  right  seat  provided  the  other  pilot  is  NVG  Airland current and qualified. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 53 5.4.4.  Max Effort Procedures: ACs and MPD Phase 2 and 3 pilots may conduct Max Effort Takeoff  &  Landings  from  the  left  seat  w/out  IP  supervision.  NOTE:  MPD  Phase  1  pilots require direct IP supervision during Max Effort Procedures. ACs and below will not conduct Max Effort takeoffs or landings from the right seat unless an IP is in the left seat or the actual runway  is  large  enough  to  facilitate  a  normal  takeoff/landing  (i.e.  practicing  Max  Effort procedures  to  a  simulated  or  “painted”  zone).  See  “Runway,  Taxiway  and  Airfield Requirements” in Ch.5 for normal runway requirements. 5.5.  MPD  Trained  Landing  Policy.  Except  as  specified  in  paragraph  5.4,  MPD  pilots  may takeoff or land from either seat. Ample training opportunities will be given to develop skills in both seats. (T-2). 5.5.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  MPD  Phase  development  is  monitored  and  will  apply  risk management when scheduling MPD mission events with an AC. (T-2). 5.6.  Landing  Gear  and  Flap  Operating  Policy.  (T-2)  The  PF  commands  configuration changes. The PM verifies appropriate airspeed and configuration prior to echoing the gear or flap actuation  command.  The  PM  operates  the  landing  gear,  auxillary  pump  and  the  flaps  or  as briefed by the PIC. 5.7.  Outside  Observer/ACM  Duties.  Available  crewmembers  will  assist  in  clearing  during taxi operations, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 ft MSL as crew duties permit. (T-3). 5.8.  Seat  Belts.  Crewmembers occupying the P and CP positions will have seat belts fastened from engine start through shutdown, except as outlined in paragraph 5.2 and the following: (T-2). 5.8.1.  All  occupants  will  be  seated  with  seat  belts  and  shoulder  harnesses  (if  available) fastened during taxi,  takeoffs, and landings.  (T-2).   EXCEPTION:  Evaluators,  Instructors, Mission  Commanders,  crewmembers  performing  scanner  duties,  outside  observers  during taxi, LMs and medical personnel performing required duties; however, those individuals will have a designated seat (spot for combat loading procedures) and required restraint available. EXCEPTION:    shoulder  harnesses  may  be  removed  above  10,000  MSL  during  cruise,  but shall be fastened before beginning descent to terminal areas. 5.8.2.  Provide a safety belt for all occupants over 2 years of age.  Occupants will fasten seat belts  and  shoulder  harnesses  (if  available)  securely  when  turbulence  is  encountered  or anticipated, or in areas of forecast clear air turbulence. (T-2). 5.8.3.  Floor loading is authorized. Aircrews will not use this procedure in lieu of providing normal seating when available. (T-2).  Consideration should be given to oxygen requirements and liferaft provisions. 5.9.  Aircraft  Lighting.  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  AFI  11-218,  Aircraft  Operations  and  Movement on the Ground, and applicable T.O.s. 5.9.1.  NVG Lighting.  Lights-out operations during peacetime are conducted IAW AFI 11-202V3 and local procedures as required.  During contingency operations IAW SPINS. 5.9.1.1.  Total  lights  out  operations  are  authorized  with  concurrence  of  the  controlling agency in restricted airspace and warning areas. 54 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 5.9.2.  Cargo  compartment  lighting  is  dictated  by  the  tactical  situation  and  will  be coordinated  between  the  mission  commander/PIC  and  LM(s).    Cargo  compartment emergencies may require overt lighting on full bright.  The nature of the emergency and the tactical situation dictates what level of lights is used, and whether the LM continues the use of NVGs. 5.9.3.  Strobe  Lights.    During  contingency  operations  IAW  SPINS.  For  non-tactical operations, the aircrew will operate the aircraft strobe lights as follows: (T-3). 5.9.3.1.  BEFORE  STARTING  ENGINES  Checklist.  When  operating  the  APU,  set  the top strobe to RED. 5.9.3.2.  LINEUP Checklist.   Set  both strobes to WHT during daylight  and RED during night operations. 5.9.3.3.  AFTER  LANDING  Checklist.    Set  the  top  strobe  to  RED.    The  top  strobe remains in RED until APU shutdown. 5.10.  Portable Electronic Devices.  IAW AFI 11-202V3 and associated supplements. 5.10.1.  Aircrew members will not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) or  personal  devices  with  RF  transmit/receive  capability  on  aircraft  carrying  hazard  class  1 explosive  cargo  at  anytime.  (T-2).    Prohibited  devices  include  cellular  phones  and  laptop computers/PDAs  with  wireless  capability  enabled  (i.e.  Bluetooth).    LMs  will  ensure passengers  comply  with  this  restriction.  (T-2).    Aircrew  members  may  use  certified  GFE such as PFPS laptops, handheld (HH) GPS, and PDAs with infrared transmitters. 5.10.2.  Approved laptop computers and software, such as PFPS  are allowed in-flight  IAW AFI 11-202V3. 5.11.  Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft.  Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force aircraft. 5.12.  Advisory/Required  Calls.  The  PF  will  announce  changes  to  the  level  of  automation, flight  director  and  autopilot  mode  section,  and  mode  transition,  (e.g.  “Autopilot  engaged”, “Altitude  hold”,  “Auto-throttles”,  “Nav-Capture”,  etc.)  and/or  when  circumstances  require deviating from normal procedures. (T-2). 5.12.1.  Deviations.  Any  crewmember  seeing  a  deviation  of  heading  (+/-  10  degrees), airspeed  (+/-10  kts),  or  altitude  (+/-  100  ft),  and  no  attempt  is  being  made  to  correct  the deviation will immediately notify the PF. (T-2). 5.12.2.  Any crewmember seeing a potential terrain or obstruction problem will immediately notify the PF. (T-2). 5.12.3.  Advisory  calls:  Table  5.1  through  Table  5.4  contain  the  listing  of  mandatory advisory calls, responses, and aircrew actions. Table 5.1.  Takeoff.

Note 2.  The PF will announce intentions to land or go-around. Note 3.  Refer to stabilized approach criteria in paragraph 5.13. Note 4.  For CAT II approaches crosscheck offside Radar Altimeter if not accomplished previously on approach (i.e., 1000 AGL). 5.13.  Stabilized  Approach  Philosophy.  Unstable  approaches  are  primary  contributors  to numerous  military  and  civilian  mishaps.    Stabilized  approaches  are  essential  for  the  safe operation of aircraft and are mandatory.  This criterion defines specific parameters that mitigate the risk during this critical phase of flight.  This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate corrective actions to stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters. 5.13.1.  The PIC must comply with the following criteria for all non-tactical approaches: (T-2) 5.13.1.1.  At 1000 ft AGL (IMC): 5.13.1.1.1.  Airspeed  is  -5/+15  knots  of  computed  approach  speed  for  aircraft configuration. 5.13.1.1.2.  Aircraft is in a landing configuration. 5.13.1.1.3.  Sink rate is no greater than 1500 FPM. 5.13.1.1.4.  All briefings and checklists are complete. 5.13.1.1.5.  If these criteria are not met by 1000 ft AGL (IMC), the PM will announce the deviation. (T-2). 5.13.1.2.  At 500 ft AGL (IMC/VMC): 5.13.1.2.1.  Airspeed  is  -5/+10  knots  of  computed  approach  speed  for  aircraft configuration. 5.13.1.2.2.  Aircraft is in a landing configuration. 5.13.1.2.3.  Sink rate is no greater 1000 FPM. 5.13.1.2.4.  All briefings and checklists are complete. 5.13.1.2.5.  If these criteria are not met by 500 ft AGL for all non-tactical approaches, the  PM  will  announce  "Unstable,  go  around."  (T-2).    The  PF  will  execute  a  missed approach. (T-2). 5.13.2.  Tactical  Approaches/VFR  Patterns.    Stabilized  approach  criteria  for  tactical approaches/VFR  patterns  is  recommended  and  desired.    However,  it  is  recognized  that  this criteria is not always valid due to the type of approach being conducted. In this situation, the PF is required to brief the maneuver parameters prior to execution. (T-2). 5.14.  Communications  Policy.  The  Air  Force  does  not  give  a  promise  of  confidentiality  to aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications.  Crewmembers are expected to maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times. 5.14.1.  Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor VOX and interphone during all phases of flight. (T-2).  Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off interphone. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 57 (T-2).    Crewmembers  will  ensure  personnel  on  headset  or  within  listening  distance  are cleared  prior  to  discussing  classified  information  over  interphone.  (T-2).    Additional precautions should be briefed as required. 5.14.2.  Radios: 5.14.2.1.  The PM normally makes all ATC radio calls. 5.14.2.2.  In terminal  areas, all crewmembers (if  able) should monitor the primary ATC radio  unless  directed  otherwise.    A  crewmember  will  be  designated  to  monitor  C2 frequencies on the inbound and outbound legs. (T-2). 5.14.2.3.  The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and update the crew when the primary radio changes. (T-2). 5.14.2.4.  One pilot should record and read back all ATC clearances. 5.14.2.5.  Both  pilots  will  monitor  UHF  and  VHF  guard  emergency  frequencies  to  the maximum extent possible. (T-2).  EXCEPTION: During Receiver AAR the CSO should monitor those frequencies. 5.14.2.6.  The  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  prohibits  the  use  of unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training. 5.14.3.  Classified Communication Policies: 5.14.3.1.  Aircrews will not discuss classified information on the interphone during radio transmissions. (T-2). 5.14.3.2.  The  PIC  will  ensure  the  classified  interphone  or  radio  transmissions  are recorded on the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) if it is operating. Ensure the CVR remains on  and  running  for  30  minutes  until  the  tape  is  clear  of  any  recorded  classified conversations. (T-2) If classified information is discussed while the EO/IR voice recorder is  used  in  flight,  the  PIC  will  ensure  the  Removable  Memory  Module  (RMM)  card  is turned  into  tactics  to  be  classified  upon  landing.  (T-2).    If  en  route,  have  the  classified courier maintain the RMM card until it has been properly classified. 5.14.3.3.  Non-aircrew  members  may  monitor  interphone  or  radio  transmissions  only when specifically approved by the AC.  The AC will ensure the communications policy is briefed  to  these  personnel  prior  to  flight.  (T-2).    The  AC  must  ensure  no  one  monitors classified information for which they  are not  cleared or transmits  classified information over the radios. (T-2). 5.14.3.4.  In order to prevent accidental recording of classified information on the Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) or downloading it via the maintenance Data Transfer and Diagnostic  System  (DTADS),  crews  need  to  be  fully  aware  of  how  the  DFDR  and DTADS  work.    DTADS  is  used  routinely  to  download  data  from  the  DFDR  for  the  C-130J  AIRCAT  program  to  assess  structural  life  and  other  factors.    DTADS  is  an unclassified  system. information  such  as latitude/longitude,  it  could  be  downloaded  in  this  process.    Maintainer's  attach  the DTADS system directly to the DFDR export connect to accomplish the download.  This process only copies the data, the original content remains on the DFDR until written over.  In order to ensure classified information is not recorded to the DFDR; crews should use the  DFDR  contains  classified  If 58 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 the  'record  inhibit'  functionality  in  the  CNI-MU  during  classified  missions  and  inhibit data which is determined to be classified. 5.15.  Crew Resource Management (CRM). 5.15.1.  “Time Out” is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use of “Time Out” does: 5.15.1.1.  Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness. 5.15.1.2.  Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs. 5.15.1.3.  Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from established  guidelines,  the  briefed  scenario,  or  that  someone  is  simply  uncomfortable with the developing conditions. 5.15.2.  As  soon  as  possible  after  a  “Time  Out”  has  been  called,  the  aircrew  will  take  the following actions: (T-2). 5.15.2.1.  Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft and ensure terrain clearance. 5.15.2.2.  The initiating crewmember voices their concerns to the crew. 5.15.2.3.  The PIC provides all other crewmembers with  the opportunity  to  voice inputs relative to the stated concerns. 5.15.2.4.  After considering all inputs, the PIC directs the aircrew to continue the current course of action or direct a new course of action. 5.15.3.  Knock-It-Off  (KIO)  and  Terminate  Calls.    Use  KIO  or  Terminate  procedures  to direct  aircraft  to  stop  engagements,  scenarios,  and  tactical  maneuvering.    Procedures  IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures. 5.15.4.  Sterile  Cockpit.    Limit  conversation  to  essential  for  crew  coordination  and  mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below 3,000 ft AGL. 5.15.5.  Fuel  Panel.   The fuel  panel  is  considered a “verification panel.”  The PM/LM/CSO should advise the PF before operating the panel (i.e., priming, cross-feeding, tank-to-engine, transferring, non-standard configurations, and dumping).  After completing the task, a second crewmember  should  verify  the  panel  is  set  correctly.    To  facilitate  this  coordination,  crews should plan to make changes to the fuel panel during periods of low workload such as before taxi and during cruise segments. 5.15.6.  Critical Action Coordination. 5.15.6.1.  Flight  critical/irreversible  actions  should  always  be  confirmed  by  two  crew members.    These  actions  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  pulling  the  engine  fire  handle, placing  the  engine  start  switch  to  stop,  moving  a  propeller  control  switch  to  feather, discharging agent, and dumping fuel.  The crewmember performing the action points to the affected switch/handle and verbally seeks confirmation from a second crew member (i.e.  “CONFIRM  NUMBER  ONE”).    The  crew  member  confirming  the  action  looks  at the affected switch/handle and acknowledges (i.e. “NUMBER ONE CONFIRMED”). 5.15.6.2.  Abort/Engine Shutdown Brief. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 59 5.15.6.3.  Once the fire handle is pulled, the ACAWS messages indicating the shutdown condition/situation  may  disappear.    Verifying  and  verbally  confirming  associated ACAWS  messages  prior  to  engine  shutdown  assists  the  aircrew  in  determining  if  the engine can be restarted if a greater emergency arises. 5.16.  Automation.  The  purpose  of  the  automation  is  to  assist  the  flight  crew  with  mission accomplishment.  Aircraft automation does not command crew actions.  The automated systems recommends/performs actions and the crew will determine/verify the proper course of action. (T-2). 5.16.1.  Crewmembers  will  understand  the  operation  and  limitations  of  automation  and  be proficient at operating the aircraft in all levels of automation. (T-2).  The level of automation used at any specific time should be the most appropriate to reduce crew workload, increase situational awareness, and enhance mission effectiveness and safety. 5.16.2.  If  the  AFCS/Flight  Director  provides  unexpected  commands  to  the  flight  controls, the  PF  will  revert  to  lower  levels  of  automation  or  manual  flight  as  necessary  before attempting to resolve system problems. (T-2). 5.16.3.  Crews will follow the guidance below, except for cruise flight (above 3,000 ft AGL): 5.16.3.1.  The PF will fly the aircraft and maintain a dedicated head-up lookout. (T-2).  If the PF intends to be head-down, aircraft control is transferred to the PM, who will remain head-up. (T-2).  Head-down time does not include momentary scanning of the CNI-MU, HDDs, and panels. 5.16.3.2.  Any  crewmember  that  observes  both  pilots  head-down  at  the  same  time  shall alert the PF without delay. (T-2). 5.16.3.3.  If  the  PM  diverts  attention  away  from  normal  clearing  and  monitoring  duties for  an  extended  period  of  time,  the  PM  will  state  “head-down.”  (T-2).    The  PF  will verbally acknowledge this call. (T-2).  The PM will verbalize “head-up” after completion of duties. (T-2)  The PF will then update the PM on current status as required. (T-2). 5.16.4.  The  importance  of  entering  the  proper  data  into  the  system  is  elevated  with automated  flight.    Historical  data  has  indicated  a  significant  decrease  in  the  level  of  safe operations due to pilots becoming complacent and overly reliant on automated systems. 5.16.4.1.  A closed loop system of entering data and verifying the correct data is entered before  allowing  the  aircraft  automation  to  perform  a  function  is  critically  important. Regardless of who initiates the action, the other pilot must verify the data and both pilots monitor the aircraft for the appropriate response. (T-2). 5.16.4.1.1.  Verbalize,  Verify,  and  Monitor  (VVM)  is  a  closed-loop  system  of communication  designed  to  significantly  reduce  typical  automation  selection  errors between the PF and PM. VVM consists of the following three step process: 5.16.4.1.2.  Prior  to  making  any  changes  to  the  selected  automated  system,  or performing  any  T.O.  defined  irreversible/critical  action,  the  pilot  performing  the action will VERBALIZE the intended changes. (T-2). 5.16.4.1.3.  Both  pilots  will  VERIFY  the  intended  changes  prior  to  execution,  and ensure the correct change or action was made. (T-2). 60 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 5.16.4.1.4.  Both  pilots  will  MONITOR  the  aircraft  to  ensure  the  expected performance is achieved. (T-2). 5.16.4.1.5.  The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight director and autopilot mode selections, and mode transitions to the maximum extent possible. (T-2).  The  PM  will  acknowledge  the  call.  (T-2).    Use  appropriate  levels  of automation as required by the flight conditions. 5.16.4.2.  Both pilots and CSO must comply with the standard actions in  Table 5.5  and Table 5.6 during Automated and Manual flight. (T-2). 5.16.4.3.  Automated Flight  is  defined as the  autopilot fully engaged and coupled to  the Flight  Director.    Use  autothrottles  as  desired.      CAUTION:    If  the  autothrottles  are disengaged  for  sustained  descents  during  automatic  flight,  it  is  possible  that  Altitude Capture may occur with the power levers at or near Flight Idle and result in an approach to stall condition. 5.16.4.4.  Manual Flight is defined as the PF providing manual input to the flight controls or autopilot.  Use autothrottles as desired. Table 5.5.  Automated Flight.

Traffic  Alerting  and  Collision  Avoidance  System  (TCAS).  IAW guidance in  AFI  11-202V3, General Flight Rules. 5.18.1.  Mission  requirements  and  certain  emergencies  may  allow  selection  of  “TA  only” since  the  proximity  to  aircraft  or  terrain  may  result  in  unwarranted  RAs.    Excessive  climb and descent rates could lead to inadvertent TCAS advisories.  Reducing climb/descent rates near level off can limit inadvertent TCAS advisories. 5.19.  Radar Altimeter.  The PIC will comply with the items below: (T-2). 5.19.1.  Instrument Approaches. 5.19.1.1.  Precision Approaches. 5.19.1.1.1.  Set RAD ALT reference to HAT minus 50 ft. 5.19.1.1.2.  CAT procedures/settings. II ILS.   See  AFI  11-2HC-130JV3-CL-1 for  approach 5.19.1.2.  Non-Precision  Approaches.    Setting  the  RAD  ALT  as  prescribed  below  is meant  to  adequately  alert  the  crew  to  an  unsafe  terrain  clearance  condition  ("Altitude-Altitude") in the absence of a "Minimums-Minimums" alert.  Setting the RAD ALT to a higher  setting  than  prescribed  may  result  in  premature/unexpected  "Altitude-Altitude" advisories and prevent the GCAS "Minimums" alert. 5.19.1.2.1.  Straight-In  Approaches.    Normally  set  RAD  ALT  reference  to  250  ft (minimum setting). 5.19.1.2.2.  Circling  Approaches.    Normally  set  RAD  ALT  reference  to  300  ft (minimum setting). 5.19.1.3.  When  established  on  a  published  approach  in  IMC,  or  at  night  when  terrain clearance cannot be assured, and an "Altitude-Altitude" special alert is heard, initiate an immediate  go-around.    Once  terrain  clearance  is  confirmed,  resume  normal  operations.  In  day  VMC,  the  aircrew  evaluates  the  alert  and  determines  the  appropriate  course  of action (continue the approach or go-around). 62 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 5.19.2.  Tactical Operations.  Reference Chapter 16, paragraph 16.20 for further guidance. 5.20.  Runway, Taxiway and Airfield Requirements. 5.20.1.  Minimum  Runway  and  Taxiway  Requirements.  The  PIC  will  comply  with  the following items: For other than combat/contingency operations, do not use runways less than 3,000 ft long unless approved by the OG/CC or designated representative. (T-2)   Minimum runway width is 80 ft (60 ft for max effort qualified crews).  Minimum taxiway width is 30 ft.  The MAJCOM/A3 may waive runway/taxiway width requirements. Use Table 5.7 when applicable.  NOTE:  The  use  of  non-hard  surfaced  runways  or  taxiways  can  be  delegated down to the SQ/CC (or deployed equivalent) for approval. Use Table 5.7 when applicable. 5.20.2.  Use  of  Wheel  Brakes.    If  greater  than  a  flight  manual  defined  “partially  braked landing” is used, the PIC will comply with all zone requirements and minimum brake cooling times  IAW  the  performance  manual  LANDING  BRAKE  ENERGY  chart.  (T-2).    This ensures adequate braking capability is available for any subsequent takeoff and abort. 5.20.3.  Normal Operations. The PIC will comply with the following operations: (T-2) 5.20.3.1.  The minimum runway required for a normal takeoff is the charted CFL. 5.20.3.2.  Normal  takeoffs  are  not  made  when  Refusal  Speed  is  less  than  Ground Minimum Control Speed (Vmcg). In this condition the PIC will either: (T-2) 5.20.3.2.1.  Download cargo or fuel. 5.20.3.2.2.  Wait until weather conditions improve. 5.20.3.2.3.  Utilize maximum effort procedures, see paragraph 5.20.7. 5.20.3.3.  Runway  Length for Takeoff and  Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, takeoffs are initiated from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway.  Intersection takeoffs  may  be  made  at  the  discretion  of  the  PIC  provided  the  operating  environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows for a safe takeoff and departure. The PIC will update CNI TOLD to reflect actual runway remaining. (T-2). 5.20.3.4.  The  minimum  runway  required  for  normal  landings  is  the  charted  landing distance over 50 ft obstacle with outboard engines in high speed ground idle and inboard engines in max reverse. 5.20.3.5.  Use  of  Overruns.    If  approach  end  overruns  are  available,  stressed,  and authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff.  Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing if needed. 5.20.3.6.  Acceleration  Check  Time.    An  acceleration  time  check  is  mandatory  when refusal  speed  is  less  than  rotation  speed.    An  Acceleration  Time  Check  should  be computed  when,  in  the  opinion  of  the  PIC,  a  critical  condition  exists  (heavy  GW,  high PA, obstacles, RSC, etc.). 5.20.4.  Arresting Cables. The PIC will comply with the items below: (T-2) 5.20.4.1.  Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include recessed cables).  If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower to have the cable inspected. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 63 5.20.4.2.  Do  not  takeoff  or  land  over  an  approach  end  cable  that  has  been  reported  as slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, ATIS, or ATC. 5.20.4.3.  Operations  are  authorized  on  runways  where  BAK-12  systems  are  installed, with  an  eight  point  cable  tie-down  system,  without  regard  to  the  flight  manual  caution.  When operating from runways equipped with other types of systems, or if it is unknown if  the  BAK-12  system  includes  eight  point  tie-downs,  aircrews  should  recognize  the increased risk of damage to the aircraft. 5.20.5.  Other Airfield Requirements. 5.20.5.1.  Aircraft  Rescue  Fire  Fighting  Requirements  (ARFF).    ARFF  requirements  at non-USAF active flying bases are as follows: 5.20.5.1.1.  Refer  to  AFPAM  32-2004,  Aircraft  Fire  Protection  for  Exercises  and Contingency  Response  Operations,  and  AFI  13-217,  Drop  Zone  and  Landing  Zone Operations,  to  calculate  ARFF  requirements.      NOTE:    Non-USAF  ARFF  vehicles may be used if the agent and pumping capabilities are equivalent. 5.20.5.1.2.  Each  Group/Wing  should  track  landing  totals  at  airfields  under  their control.    If  landing  totals  are  not  tracked  at  airfields  owned/controlled  by  other agencies, Group/Wing current ops will track landings to ensure the restriction is not exceeded for assigned aircraft. (T-2). 5.20.5.1.3.  Waivers  to  the  ARFF  requirements  are  considered  on  a  case-by-case basis.  Required information for waiver requests can be found in AFPAM 32-2004. 5.20.5.2.  A  current  landing  zone  (LZ)  survey  is  needed  before  using  other  than  hard-surfaced runways or taxiways. 5.20.6.  RCR and RSC Limitations. 5.20.6.1.  When other than RCR or RSC is used to report the runway conditions, refer to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) for standard ICAO conversions based on general runway conditions; be conservative when dealing with unknown conditions (e.g., forward operating bases (FOBs), unpaved runways).   Normally, RCR values are not reported for taxiways and ramps.  During periods of reported low RCR, the taxiways and ramps may have  an  even  lower  RCR  than  reported  for  the  runway.    The  runway  surface  should  be considered wet when water on the runway causes a reflective glare. 5.20.6.2.  The performance charts used to determine braking action are based on concrete runways.  Use the RCR values given in  Table 5.7 when landing on other than concrete surfaces. The RCR values in Table 5.7 are estimates based on operational experience and should be used only as a guide. Table 5.7.  RCR Values. TYPE SURFACE Asphalt Aluminum Matting M8A1/With Anti-Skid (PSP) M8A1/Without Anti-Skid (PSP) RCR (DRY)  RCR (WET) 23 20 20 13 12 10 8 3 64 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 Clay/Crushed Rock/Coral 16 5 5.20.6.3.  Limit HC-130J operations into and out of slush or water covered runways to a covering of one inch.  This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10 is equal to one inch of slush or water.  Performance data where more than one inch of slush or water is present may not be accurate. 5.20.6.4.  On runways partially covered with snow or ice, takeoff computations are based on the reported RSC or RCR for the cleared portion of the runway.  A minimum of 40 ft either side of centerline should be cleared (30 ft for maximum effort procedures).  If 40 ft either side of centerline is not cleared (30 ft for max effort procedures), computations are based on the non-cleared portion. 5.20.7.  Maximum Effort Operations. 5.20.7.1.  Use Maximum Effort  procedures when conditions  (runway dimensions and/or obstacles)  or  directives  require  their  use.    Runway  widths  less  than  80  ft  require  a maximum  effort  qualified  crew.  (T-3).    The  PIC  must  ensure  all  maximum  effort operations  fall  in  the  "Recommended"  area  of  the  wind  limitations  charts  unless otherwise approved by the OG/CC. (T-3). 5.20.7.2.  Maximum Effort Takeoff.  Use maximum effort takeoff procedures if available runway length is less than CFL. 5.20.7.2.1.  Minimum runway length is the charted AMFLMETO. Minimum rotation speed  is  Adjusted  Maximum  Effort  Rotation  Speed  (VRamax).  EXCEPTION:  SQ/CCs  may  approve  the  use  of  MFLMETO  and  VRmax  if  mission  necessity dictates. 5.20.7.2.2.  Minimum  rotation  speed  is  Adjusted  Maximum  Effort  Rotation  Speed (VRamax).      EXCEPTION:    SQ/CC  may  approve  the  use  of  VRmax  if  mission necessity dictates. 5.20.7.3.  Maximum Effort Landing.  Use maximum effort landing procedures whenever the runway available for landing is less than that required for a normal landing.  Plan the touchdown within the first 500 ft of usable runway. 5.20.7.3.1.  The minimum runway required for a maximum effort landing is equal to the charted Maximum Effort landing ground roll plus 500 ft.  If the zone is unmarked, minimum  runway  length  is  ground  roll  plus  1,000  ft.    OG/CC  (or  deployed equivalent) may approve ground roll plus 500 ft to an unmarked zone.  WARNING:  The PIC will identify a go-around point to all crewmembers for all maximum effort landings and AMP-4 operations prior to execution. (T-2). 5.20.7.3.2.  Compute  landing  performance  using:  two  outboard  engines  in  ground idle,  two  inboard  engines  in  reverse,  (“2OB  HGI;  2IB  REV”  in  the  Performance Manual),  and  maximum  anti-skid  braking.    OG/CC  (or  deployed  equivalent)  may approve the use of all four in reverse performance data. 5.20.7.4.  Training. 5.20.7.4.1.  Minimum  runway  length  is  3,000  ft  or  IAW  paragraph  5.20.7.2.1  and  5.20.7.3.1. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 65 5.20.7.4.2.  Takeoff  speed  is  Adjusted  Max  Effort  Rotation  Speed  (AMAX).  Squadron commanders may approve the use of actual max effort speeds (takeoff and obstacle clearance) on a case-by-case basis. 5.20.7.4.3.  Simulated obstacle clearance height can not exceed 50 ft. 5.21.  Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Avoidance.  Comply with the items below: 5.21.1.  Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 ft of obstructions without wing walkers monitoring the clearance between aircraft and obstruction.   With wing walkers, avoid taxi  obstructions by at least 10 ft.  EXCEPTION:   IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, aircraft may taxi into or out of a marked parking spot without marshallers/wing walkers  at  home  station  along  fixed  taxi  lines  which  have  been  measured  to  ensure  a minimum  of  10  ft  clearance  from  any  permanent  obstruction.    Adjacent  aircraft  are considered a permanent obstruction provided the aircraft is parked properly in its designated spot  and  not  moving.  Aerospace  Ground  Equipment  (AGE)  and  vehicles  are  considered  a permanent  obstruction provided it is parked entirely within a designated area. OG/CCs will ensure  areas  are  designated  by  permanent  markings  such  as  painted  boxes  or  lines  on  the ramp or another suitable means. (T-2). 5.21.2.  When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are unavailable,  the  PIC  will  deplane  crewmembers  to  maintain  obstruction  clearance  and provide  marshaling  using  AFI  11-218  signals.  (T-2).    Use  wing  walkers,  deplaned crewmembers, or a crewmember on interphone positioned at the paratroop door(s) or ramp to act  as  an  observer  while  maneuvering  on  narrow  taxiways.  During  night  taxi  operations, marshallers and wing walkers will have an illuminated wand in each hand. (T-2).  Observers should  be  in  a  position  to  see  wing  walkers  at  all  times  (through  door  or  windows)  and communicate with the pilot. 5.21.3.  FOD  Avoidance.    Make  every  effort  to  minimize  the  potential  for  engine  FOD.  Crews should: 5.21.3.1.  Carefully review airfield layout during mission planning.  Be familiar with taxi routes, turn requirements, and areas for potential FOD. 5.21.3.2.  Minimize power settings during all taxi operations. 5.21.4.  Reverse  Taxi.  The  PIC  shall  coordinate  reverse  taxi  directions  and  signals  with  the LM and marshaller (when available). (T-2).  Before reverse taxiing, the LM shall: 5.21.4.1.  Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated. (T-2). 5.21.4.2.  Open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12-inches above horizontal. (T-2). 5.21.4.3.  Position  himself/herself  on  the  aircraft  ramp  to  direct  reverse  taxi,  report  any hazards,  and    provide  the  PIC  with  timely  interphone  instructions  on  turns,  distance remaining, conditions of the maneuvering area, and stopping point. (T-2). 5.21.4.4.  Stop no less than 25 ft from an obstruction even if using a wing walker. (T-2). 5.21.4.5.  During  night  reverse  taxi  operations  without  NVGs,  the  PIC  and  LM  will ensure the taxi area is sufficiently lighted. (T-2). 66 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 5.21.5.  After  landing  and  clearing  the  runway,  and  with  approval  of  the  PIC,  the  LM  may open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to horizontal to prepare for cargo offload/onload provided equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secure in the cargo compartment.  Careful attention should be given to the ramp position when taxiing on rough or unprepared surfaces. 5.22.  Fuel Jettison Procedures. 5.22.1.  PICs should elect to burn down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of flight dictates an immediate jettison (as determined by the PIC).  Except in the case of an emergency, before jettisoning  fuel,  notify  the  appropriate  ATC  or  flight  service  facility  of  intentions,  altitude, and  location.  If  available,  the  PIC  will  use  designated  jettison  areas,  except  when  safety  of flight would be compromised. (T-2). 5.22.2.  For  missions  tasked  by  higher  headquarters  authority,  the  tasking  C2  agency  may authorize  fuel  jettison  when  an  urgent  operational  requirement  dictates  immediate recovery/reconstitution  of  the  aircraft  and/or  aircrew.    The  tasking  C2  agency  may  provide fuel jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc. 5.22.3.  For  training  missions,  the  OG/CC  may  approve  fuel  jettison  when  an  urgent operational  requirement  exists  to  expedite  recovery  of  the  aircraft  and  all  alternatives  have been exhausted. 5.22.4.  OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to  minimize the impact  of fuel jettison.  (T-2).    Ideally,  establish  jettison  areas  at  altitudes  above  20,000  ft  AGL,  off published  airways,  avoiding  urban  areas,  agricultural  regions,  and  water  supply  sources.  Avoid circling descents. Initiate AF Form 813,  Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, and submit it to the base environmental coordinator. 5.23.  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Programs.  BASH  programs  are centralized  unit  efforts  that  provide  information  cross-feed,  hazard  identification,  and  a consolidated course of action. 5.23.1.  PICs must ensure compliance with base directives but never less restrictive than the AFPAM 91-212.  (T-2).   Consider bird migratory patterns during the enroute portion of the mission to help minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike.  The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM)  on  HQ  AFSC/SEF  website  contains  BASH  information  including  regionalized CONUS  bird  migration  patterns,  PFPS  software  overlay,  and  the  latest  news.    The  Avian Hazard  Advisory  System  (AHAS)  website  is  another  source  for  real  time  bird  hazard information.  See AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, for additional information. 5.23.1.1.  Bird Watch Condition  Low  - No significant  bird activity that would  present  a probable hazard to flying operations. List restrictions in local Chapter 10. 5.23.1.2.  Bird  Watch  Condition  Moderate  -  Concentrations  of  5  to  15  large  birds (waterfowl, raptors, gulls, etc.) or 15 to 30 small birds (terns, swallows, etc.) observable in locations that represent a probable hazard to flying operations. Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed when departure and arrival routes avoid bird activity. List restrictions in local Chapter 10. 5.23.1.3.  Bird  Watch  Condition  Severe  -  Bird  conditions  greater  than  moderate.  List restrictions in local Chapter 10. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 67 5.23.2.  When  operating  at  airfields  where  no  BASH  program  exists,  the  PIC  has  the authority  to  delay  takeoffs  and  arrivals  due  to  bird  condition  after  coordinating  with  the appropriate C2 authority. 5.23.3.  Following  a  bird  strike,  aircrews  should  land  as  soon  as  conditions  permit,  or  as practical, to inspect the aircraft for damage. 5.24.  Aircraft  Recovery  from  Unprepared  Surfaces.  Aircrews  will  not  normally  attempt  to recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground crews  accomplish  aircraft  recovery.  (T-2).    Unless  an  emergency  dictates  otherwise,  aircrews may only accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface can support the aircraft, and the PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities. 5.25.  Functional  Check  Flights  (FCFs)  and  Acceptance  Check  Flights  (ACFs).  FCFs  and ACFs  will  be  accomplished  IAW  T.O.  1-1-300,  Functional  Check  Flights  and  Maintenance Operational Checks, T.O. 1C-130J-6CF-1, Acceptance or Functional Check Flight Procedures, and AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. Crews should only perform tasks  or  functions  contained  in  specific  technical  order  guidance.  If  requested  to  perform  a nonstandard function, PICs should contact their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies. 5.25.1.  FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300 and AFI 21-101. 5.26.  Participation  in  Aerial  Events.  See  AFI  11-209,  Aerial  Event  Policy  and  Procedures, and  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  supplement.  Aerial  events  must  be  sanctioned  and  individually approved  by  the  appropriate  military  authority,  and  with  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration (FAA).  AFI  11-209  and  MAJCOM  supplements  identify  events  sanctioned  for  support,  and specifies the approval authority for each type. 68 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 Chapter 6 AIRCREW PROCEDURES Section 6A—Pre-Mission 6.1.  Aircrew Uniforms. 6.1.1.  Wear  the  aircrew  uniform  as  outlined  in  AFI  11-301V1,  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment (AFE)  Program,  and  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  supplement,  on  all  missions,  unless  other attire is authorized.  When the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) requires civilian attire, wear conservatively styled clothing. 6.1.2.  All  crewmembers  will  have  Nomex  gloves  in  their  possession.  (T-2).    LMs  and anyone  assisting  will  wear  gloves  for  all  airdrops,  cargo  loading/unloading,  winching,  and pyrotechnic operations. (T-2). 6.1.3.  Crewmembers will remove rings and scarves before performing aircrew duties. (T-2). 6.1.4.  Personnel will have the appropriate items of clothing in their possession when flying in Arctic and Antarctic regions. (T-2). EXCEPTION:  Not applicable to transoceanic flights or when staging or transiting Elmendorf AFB, AK. 6.2.  Personal and Professional Equipment. 6.2.1.  Passports. Carry passports on missions when the FCG requires them. 6.2.2.  Shot  Records.    Carry  shot  records  on  all  off-station  missions  outside  the  CONUS, Alaska, or Hawaii. Aircrew members must meet immunization requirements for the mission. (T-2). 6.2.3.  Identification Tags.  Aircrew members will wear Identification tags around the neck or carry them in a flight suit pocket. (T-2). 6.2.4.  FOD  Hazards.  Crewmembers  will  not  wear  wigs,  hairpieces,  rings,  ornaments,  pins, clips,  other  hair  fasteners,  or  earrings  in  the  aircraft  or  on  the  flightline.  (T-2).   EXCEPTION:    Female  crew  members  may  wear  plain  elastic  hair  fasteners  or  plastic barrettes,  providing  they  do  not  interfere  with  the  wearing  of  headsets,  helmets,  or  the donning of oxygen equipment.  Account for all devices before and after flight. 6.2.5.  Flight  Kits.  Aircrews  must  carry  a  headset,  helmet,  oxygen  mask,  and  operable flashlight on all flights. (T-2). 6.2.6.

Compile sufficient spare forms, flight orders, etc. to cover the TDY period. 6.3.1.8.  Ensure  the  correct  aircraft  navigation  database  is  loaded  or  carried,  as appropriate. The database should be current for the duration of the mission. If the aircraft navigation  database  is  discovered  as  expired,  or  will  expire  during  the  mission,  load  a current database before departure.   NOTE:  If mission conditions prevent installation of a  current  database,  SQ/CCs  may  allow  crews  to  continue  a  mission  with  an  expired database to the first location capable of loading a current database. Use this provision as a last  resort.  Crews  must  confirm  waypoint  data  with  another  current  source  (e.g.  FLIP, CFPS, etc.) and manually crosscheck the waypoints with NAVAIDs, if available. 6.4.  Airfield Review.  Accomplish airfield review IAW AFI 11-202V3. 6.5.  Intelligence  Briefing.  Before  departing  on  missions  outside  the  United  States,  aircrews will receive an intelligence briefing that emphasizes terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military  development  in  the  planned  operating  area.  (T-3).    In  theater,  aircrews  should  receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a forward operating location (FOL), or enroute stop, and thereafter  when  significant  developments  occur.    Report  information  of  possible  intelligence 70 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 value  to  the  local  intelligence  office  as  soon  as  practical  to  ensure  timely  dissemination  of mission reports (MISREPs). 6.6.  Aircrew Publications Requirements.  PICs will ensure the publications specified in Table 6.1 are current and available on the aircraft for all missions. (T-3).  Units may specify additional publications  in  their  local  unit  supplement.    The  use  of  electronic  flight  manuals  in  flight  are IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules. Table 6.1.

Classified  Equipment  and  Material.  Comply  with  the  following  or  as  directed  in MAJCOM supplement. 6.7.1.  Equipment.  When classified equipment is on board, ensure the C2 Center or airfield management operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security IAW Chapter 7.  At bases not under jurisdiction of the AF, ensure the aircraft and equipment are protected.  AFI  16-1404,  Air  Force  Information  Security  Program,  provides  specific  guidance concerning the security  of various levels  of classified equipment  on board the aircraft.  For classified  aircraft  components  which  cannot  be  removed  and  stored,  lock  and  seal  the aircraft.    If  available,  use  approved  security  personnel  to  guard  the  aircraft;  otherwise,  use guards employed by the host country for flightline/airport area control. 6.7.2.  Material.  Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination and  receipts  are  obtained.    The  on-site  C2  center  can  provide  temporary  storage  for COMSEC and other classified materials during enroute, turnaround, and crew rest stops.  If a AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 71 storage facility is not available, the aircraft safe may be used for material classified up to and including  SECRET.    Aircrews  will  only  transfer  encrypted  COMSEC  to  authorized  DoD personnel. (T-1).  NOTE:  Currency is not allowed to be stored along with COMSEC in the same aircraft safe at any time. 6.7.3.  Carry  COMSEC  equipment  and  documents  required  to  operate  the  Mode  IV  on missions when required for mission accomplishment.  Carry authenticators when flying into an ADIZ, participating in exercises, on overseas missions, deployments, and when specified in operation plans.  Before departing for any destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews should contact their local COMSEC managers for guidance. 6.7.3.1.  The  COMSEC  material  required  depends  on  the  theater  of  operation  and  user.  The  base  COMSEC  custodian  has  access  to  the  AFKAG  14  and  can  assist  in  obtaining the material required for the mission. 6.7.4.  Aircrews  must  remove  classified  information  stored  in  any  electronic  devices  or aircraft  systems  (such  as  secure  HPW,  AFTRS-R,  EPLRS,  IFF,  and  mission  information.). (T-1). 6.7.5.  In  the  event  of  an  emergency,  destroy  or  damage  classified  material  and  equipment prior to crash landing or bailout, if possible. 6.8.  Narcotics.  Maintain narcotics in the pararescue medical kits IAW appropriate directives. 6.9.  Flight  Crew  Information  File  (FCIF).  Crewmembers  will  review  the  FCIF  before  all missions or ground aircrew duties and update the FCIF currency record with the latest FCIF item number,  date,  and  crewmember’s  initials.  (T-2).    If  an  electronic  sign-in  system  is  used  (i.e., PEX), verify FCIF currency appropriately utilizing that system. 6.9.1.  Crewmembers delinquent  in  FCIF or joining a mission enroute will  receive an  FCIF update  from  their  primary  aircrew  member  counterpart  on  the  mission.  (T-2).    Instructor pilots flying with general officers will brief appropriate FCIF items to them. (T-2). 6.9.2.  Certify FCIF review for crewmembers not assigned or attached to the unit operating a mission by entering the last FCIF number and their initials beside their name on the file copy of the flight authorization or file copy of their crew orders.  This applies to all crewmembers if the electronic sign in system is not operational at alert time. 6.10.  Risk  Management  (RM).  RM  is  logic  based,  common  sense  approach  to  making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors.  PICs will accomplish RM assessment IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as part of preflight activities. (T-2). 6.10.1.  SQ/CCs will develop RM guidelines to identify and mitigate acceptable levels of risk for all missions. (T-2).  OG/CCs will be the approval authority for unit RM guidelines. (T-2). 6.11.  Aircraft  Mission  Kits.  Units  will  maintain  one  mission  kit  per  aircraft  for operational/contingency missions. (T-2).  EXCEPTION: FTUs establish the number and content of the mission kits for their assigned aircraft. 6.11.1.  Prior  to  off-station  departures  (operational/contingency  missions),  the  PIC  will confirm  a  current  mission  kit  is  on  board  the  aircraft.  (T-2).    Units  must  ensure  the  kit contains listed in Table 6.2. (T-2).   Items required by a unit or wing directive to be carried by an individual crewmember need not be duplicated in the mission kit.  Maintain sufficient 72 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 quantities of directives and planning documents to allow implementation  of evacuation and contingency plans. 6.11.2.  Unit Commanders will establish mission kit contents for local training and CONUS missions. (T-2). AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 73 Table 6.2.  Aircraft Mission Kit.(T-2) SECTION I – Publications 1.

NOTE:  Units may modify the kit to carry only FLIP documents for the theater of operations. Quantity Required 1 1 1 2 2 (if available) 3* 3*  As Required 1 6.13.  Briefing Requirements. 6.13.1.  Briefings  should  be  clear,  concise,  and  designed  to  provide  mission  essential information.  Refer to the appropriate briefing guides for content. 6.13.2.  Crewmembers will not fly unless they attend the crew briefings for their mission. (T-2).  EXCEPTION:    When  pre-mission  requirements  dictate,  the  PIC  may  excuse  certain crewmembers  from  the  briefing.    The  PIC  will  conduct  a  face-to-face  briefing  with  those personnel prior to engine start. (T-2). 6.14.  Call Signs.  Use Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL) or as specified in mission directives for all  missions  except  local  area  training  missions.    Use  squadron  or  wing  static  call  signs,  as directed, for local area training missions. 6.14.1.  Aeromedical  Evacuation.    Preface  normal  call  sign  with  “EVAC”  plus  the  last  five digits of the aircraft tail number when patients are on board. 6.14.2.  Search and Rescue (SAR). When tasked to participate in SAR operations, use the call sign “AIR FORCE RESCUE” plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number. 6.15.  Instrument  Flight  Rules.  Conduct  flight  operations  under  IFR  to  the  maximum  extent possible  without  unacceptable  mission  degradation.    This  does  not  preclude  VFR  training  to maintain proficiency in mission essential VFR operations. 6.16.  Sensitive Mission Operations. 6.16.1.  Certain  missions  require  special  flight  planning  procedures  or  deceptive  measures.  Mission operating directives, MAJCOM/CC operations orders, or other tasking orders direct use of these procedures.  Brief crew members on modification to normal procedures prior to execution of the operation.  For these types of missions, the MAJCOM/CC or COMAFFOR will approve missions requiring coordination with non-ACC agencies prior to execution. (T-2). AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 75 6.16.2.  The  planning  agency  tasked  with  the  mission  normally  provides  aircrew  with  the following information: 6.16.2.1.  Departure procedures. 6.16.2.2.  Enroute  procedures  to  include  tracks,  ALTRVs,  MARSA,  tanker  rendezvous, and emergency divert procedures. 6.16.2.3.  Arrival procedures. 6.16.2.4.  All communications requirements. 6.17.  Flight Plan/Data Verification. 6.17.1.  Computer  Flight  Plan  (CFP)  Use.    CFPs  are  an  official  source  of  performance, navigation, and climatic data, including enroute wind information.  If stand-alone computer based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available.  Use only MAJCOM validated CFPs.  Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by the aircrew or furnished  by  another  agency,  the  PIC  and  CSO  will  verify  routes  and  flight  altitudes  for proper terrain clearance. (T-2). 6.17.1.1.  Use  CFPs  to  the  maximum  extent  practical.    Flight  crews  may  manually compute  flight  plans.    The  PIC  has  final  responsibility  for  flight  plan  accuracy  and diplomatic clearance compliance. 6.17.1.2.  Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure. 6.17.2.  All waypoint data retrieved from a database should be verified by one or more of the following methods: 6.17.2.1.  Latitude/longitude from current FLIP. 6.17.2.2.  Bearing/distance from a flight plan. 6.17.2.3.  Ground based NAVAIDs. 6.17.3.  When conducting DZ/LZ operations, both pilots or the PM and CSO will verify CNI-MU  CARP/LZ  information  with  a  valid  DZ/LZ  survey.  (T-2).    Refer  to  AFI  13-217  for DZ/LZ survey information, requirements, and applicability. 6.18.  Departure  Planning.  Comply  with  AFI  11-202V3,  AFMAN  11-217V1,  AFMAN  11-217V2,  this  chapter,  and  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  supplements.    Regardless  of  the  type  of departure  flown  (IFR/VFR),  review  the  following  (as  appropriate):    IFR  Departure  Procedure, instrument approach plate, NOTAMS, GDSS Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts.  The PIC must  determine  the  obstacle  height,  distance,  and  gradient  information  necessary  for performance  computations.  (T-2).    To  verify  CNI  TOLD,  both  pilots  will  cross-check  CNI TOLD INIT entries. (T-2). 6.18.1.  VFR Departures. Do not fly VFR departures in lieu of obstacle clearance planning. 6.18.1.1.  VFR  departures  are  authorized  when  there  is  no  authorized  IFR  departure method  for  the  airport,  when  the  aircraft  cannot  depart  using  one  of  the  IFR  departure methods  contained  in  AFI  11-202V3  and  AFMAN  11-217V1,  when  operational requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the mission is planned as a 76 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 VFR flight for training.  VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain are avoided. 6.18.1.2.  The  minimum  climb  performance  for  VFR  departures  is  determined  by ensuring all the following conditions are met: 6.18.1.2.1.  All-engine  climb  capability  provides  obstacle  avoidance  along  departure route. 6.18.1.2.2.  Weather  Minimums  For  Takeoff  and  Departure  Alternate  Procedures.  Pilots must use Table 6.4 and AFI 11-202V3. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 77 Table 6.4.  Alternative Takeoff Minima and Departure Alternate Procedures. Approval Authority Departure Alternate Not Required Not Required (see note 1) OG/CC or designated representative Required (see notes 1, 2 and 3) Required (see notes 1, 2, 3 and 4) OG/CC or designated representative, if mission is HHQ directed Departure Weather At or above authorized ceiling and visibility landing minimums Below either authorized ceiling or visibility minimums and RVR is 1600 or greater (visibility 1/4 miles or greater) Below either authorized ceiling or visibility minimums and RVR is less than 1600 but equal to or greater than 1000 NOTES:   1.  A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for the available approach (at departure aerodrome).  Do not use CAT II ILS minimums to determine if a departure alternate is required.  2.  To qualify as a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:      a.  Alternate must be located within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1 hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400).  -OR-    b.  Alternate must be located within 2 hours flying time, the existing weather must be at least 500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but no lower than 600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for ETA at the alternate +/- 1 hour.  3.  Aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria.  4.  Departure runway must have operational centerline lighting and dual RVR readouts and displays for both the approach and departure end of runway (RVR must be at or greater than 1000 at both the approach end and departure end and runway).  For runways with triple RVR readouts, the pilot may use any two consecutive read-outs to determine if the runway is usable for departure (aircraft performance permitting).  For example: Approach end RVR=800, midfield RVR=1200, departure end RVR=1000.  If aircraft performance and runway length will permit taking off at midfield, this runway is usable for takeoff. 6.19.  Arrival Planning.  The forecast destination weather is according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following: 6.19.1.  File two alternates when: 78 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 6.19.1.1.  The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the available DoD or FAA AeroNav Products (AJV-3) precision approach. 6.19.1.2.  The  forecast  ceiling  OR  visibility  (intermittent  or  prevailing)  is  less  than published for all other approaches.  For approaches with no published ceiling requirement (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling is computed by taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest 100 ft (or as determined by MAJCOM  TERPs  review).    For  example,  a  Jeppesen  VOR  approach  with  a  published HAA of 642 ft would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 ft. 6.19.1.3.  The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected for RCR. 6.19.2.  File  an  alternate,  regardless  of  forecast  weather,  when  the  destination  aerodrome  is outside the CONUS.  EXCEPTION:  OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do not exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3. 6.19.3.  A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time.  (T-2) PICs must ensure the forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria: 6.19.3.1.  The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, are within limits at ETA and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and. 6.19.3.2.  The  prevailing  ceiling  and  visibility  are  equal  to  or  greater  than  published minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours.  However, if a precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-precision  approach  minimums,  but  not  below  precision  approach  minimums  (for  ETA plus 2 hours).  NOTE:  See Chapter 12 for fuel planning considerations to a remote or island destination. 6.19.4.  When  filing  to  a  destination  where  the  alternate  is  located  in  Alaska  or  at  latitudes greater than 59°N, see Chapter 12 for fuel planning considerations. 6.20.  Adverse  Weather.  All  missions  should  be  planned  to  avoid  areas  of  severe  weather. Comply with the following procedures and prohibitions: 6.20.1.  Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited. 6.20.1.1.  Anytime  windshear  may  be  encountered  on  departure  or  approach,  it  is recommended  that  aircrews  select  weather  mode  on  one  NAV  RADAR  display  and windshear mode on another NAV RADAR display. 6.20.1.2.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  all  passengers  are  seated,  with  seat  belts fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated. 6.20.2.  Flight  into  areas  of  forecast  or  reported  moderate  or  greater  mountain  wave turbulence is should be avoided 6.20.3.  Flight  into  areas  of  forecast  or  reported  severe  icing  is  prohibited.    Prolonged operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided. 6.20.3.1.  Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain or freezing drizzle. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 79 6.20.3.2.  When freezing rain, drizzle or fog is forecast or reported, aircrews will confirm with the supporting Air Force weather personnel, or other servicing weather organization (IAW AFI 11-202V3), what type (if any) icing is forecast or reported.  When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-icing prior to takeoff, refer to the following: 6.20.3.2.1.  Only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective flight manual. Aircrews  will  be  familiar  with,  and  follow  all  restrictions  in  their  associated  flight manual with respect to de-ice/anti-ice procedures and holdover times. (T-2). 6.20.3.2.2.  MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-icing  benefit,  and  therefore  do  not  have  holdover  times.    As  a  guide,  for  approved anti-icing  fluids,  aircrews  may  use  published  anti-icing  holdover  times  IAW  T.O. 42C-1-2, Anti-Icing, De-Icing and Defrosting of Parked Aircraft. The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and the PIC shall use time, temperature, and  dilution  of  mixture  to  determine  when  times  are  exceeded  and  re-apply  fluid  if required. (T-2). 6.20.3.2.3.  In  all  cases,  PICs  will  ensure  a  visual  inspection  of  the  aircraft  is completed within 5 minutes of departure. (T-2). 6.20.4.  Do not  fly  directly above (within  2,000 ft) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.  If unable to clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2,000 ft vertically, avoid them by at least: 6.20.4.1.  20 NMs at or above FL 230. 6.20.4.2.  10 NMs below FL 230. 6.20.4.3.  5  NMs  for  tactical  low-level  operations.      CAUTION:    Aircraft  damage  is possible  20  NMs  or  more  from  any  thunderstorm.    Refer  to  AFH  11-203,  Volume  1, Weather for Aircrews, for more information. 6.20.5.  Avoid  prolonged  flight  in  areas  of  high  lightening  potential,  i.e.,  clouds  within  +/- 5,000  ft  of  the  freezing  level  or  +/-  8°C  of  the  freezing  level,  and  in  any  intensity  of precipitation or turbulence associated with thunderstorm activity. 6.20.6.  Avoid thunderstorms visually, by airborne radar, or by specific request of a ground-based  radar.    The  use  of  ground-based  radar  as  a  means  of  thunderstorm  avoidance  should only be used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather.  It should  never  be  considered  a  normal  avoidance  procedure.    When  relying  exclusively  on ground-based  radar  for  weather  avoidance,  and  the  ground  controller  is  unable  to  provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by: 6.20.6.1.  Changing routing. 6.20.6.2.  Diverting to alternate. 6.20.6.3.  Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance. 6.20.7.  In  order  to  minimize  exposure  to  thunderstorm  hazards  when  approaching  or departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast: 6.20.7.1.  Attempt to maintain VMC. 6.20.7.2.  Maintain at least 5 NMs separation from heavy rain showers. 80 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 6.20.8.  Approaches  or  departures  may  be  accomplished  when  thunderstorms  are  in  the vicinity  of  the  airport  providing  they  are  not  producing  any  hazardous  conditions  (such  as hail, lightning, strong winds, gust fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and  are  not  forecast  or  observed  to  be  moving  in  the  direction  of  the  route  of  flight  (to include the planned missed approach corridor, if applicable). 6.20.9.  When performing approaches and landing at locations where temperature are 0°C or below,  refer  to  the  Flight  Information  Handbook  (FIH)  Section  D,  Temperature  Correction Chart, to correct MDA, DH, and other altitudes inside the FAF. 6.20.10.  Volcanic Dust Precautions. Flight into areas of forecast or reported volcanic activity or dust is prohibited.  Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least 20 NMs. Section 6C—Pre-flight 6.21.  AFTO Forms 781 Series. 6.21.1.  PICs must review the AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or  operating  aircraft  systems.  (T-2).    PICs  must  obtain  a  signed  exceptional  release  (ER) before  flight.  (T-2).    A  maintenance  officer,  maintenance  superintendent,  or  authorized civilian normally signs the ER.  If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the ER.  When a release is signed by the PIC, it is effective only for those flights in which the releasing  PIC  participates  as  an  aircrew  member.    Confirm  that  the  DD1896,  Jet  Fuel Identaplate, and AIR card are on board the aircraft. 6.21.2.  One-Time Flights.  An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another  station.    Refer  to  T.O.  00-20-1,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance  Inspection, Documentation,  Policies,  and  Procedures,  for  downgrade  authority  and  procedures.  The chief of maintenance, the senior maintenance officer, or the chief of the AFMC repair team must  first  authorize  the  release.  (T-2).    After  the  maintenance  release  is  obtained,  contact appropriate  MAJCOM,  via  Stan/Eval  channels,  for  flight  authorization.  The  PICs concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown. 6.21.3.  Aircrews  are  not  qualified  to  accomplish  the  required  ground  inspections.  In  those instances  where  maintenance  personnel  are  not  available,  the  aircrew  will  enter  a  red  dash symbol  in  the  AFTO  Form  781H,  Aerospace  Vehicle  Flight  Status  and  Maintenance Document,  updating  current  status  and  enter  a  red  dash  symbol  and  a  discrepancy  that reflects  that  the  applicable  maintenance  inspection  (i.e.  pre-flight,  thru-flight,  basic  post-flight) is overdue. (T-2). 6.21.4.  For  Red  X  clearing  procedures  at  stations  without  maintenance  support  refer  to Chapter 13. 6.22.  Dash One Pre-Flight. 6.22.1.  Aircrew Dash One Pre-flight Inspection Requirements.  Except to prepare for OREs, ORIs, and contingencies/evacuations, units should avoid using unscheduled crewmembers to accomplish multiple pre-flights. In the case where aircrew are flying an aircraft they did not preflight,  they  must  receive  a  briefing  from  the  preflight  crew  on  the  condition  of  that aircraft. (T-2). AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 81 6.22.2.  The  aircrew  dash  one  preflight  inspection  is  required  prior  to  the  first  flight  of  the flying period and remains valid until either: 6.22.2.1.  Aircraft ground time exceeds 12-hours (72-hours provided the aircraft is sealed, not flown, and documented entry control is maintained). 6.22.2.2.  Another maintenance dash six preflight is performed. 6.22.2.3.  When  an  aircrew  assumes  a  pre-flighted  spare  or  quick-turn,  perform  a thorough  visual  inspection,  paying  particular  attention  to  areas  affected  by  maintenance or servicing. 6.22.3.  Fire Protection and Crash Rescue.  See AFI 13-217 and MAJCOM specific guidance for specific Fire Fighting and Rescue requirements. 6.22.3.1.  The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements for fire protection during engine start.   If available, position a portable fire extinguisher for added fire protection. 6.22.3.2.  A  fire  guard  is  required  for  all  engine  starts  except  normal  APU  starts.    A crewmember or ground controller may act as fire guard. 6.23.  Alert  Aircraft.  When  an  aircraft  is  mobilizing  for  deployment,  units  are  authorized  to place it on alert status. Prepare the aircraft IAW established T.O.s. The aircraft will be accepted by an aircrew, remain under the control of operations, and be monitored by maintenance. (T-3).  When  sealing  an  aircraft,  accomplish  pre-flight  inspections  IAW  paragraph  6.22.  Maintain aircraft on alert status  as follows:      NOTE:  Placing  a unit on alert does  not  in  itself place the unit’s aircraft on alert status. 6.23.1.  Park the aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff. 6.23.2.  When  operationally  feasible,  have  an  aircrew  other  than  the  alert  aircrew  preflight the alert aircraft.  If this is not feasible, follow procedures outlined in paragraph 3.8.4. 6.23.3.  Aircraft preflight times should align with the start of the alert period eliminating the need to update the preflight during the alert period. 6.23.4.  The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided the following conditions are met: 6.23.4.1.  Alert  requirements  can  be  met  with  sufficient  fuel  to  meet  mission requirements. 6.23.4.2.  Communication is maintained with the primary controlling agency. 6.23.4.3.  Controlling  agencies  are  notified  any  time  the  alert  aircraft  departs  the  local area. 6.23.4.4.  Maintenance Thru-Flight Inspection. Accomplish a thru-flight inspection IAW T.O.  00-20-1  after  each  flight  when  a  turnaround  sortie,  continuation  flight,  or continuation of alert is scheduled and a basic post-flight inspection is not required. 6.23.4.4.1.  Alpha-1.    No  maintenance  actions  required.    The  aircrew  may  seal  the aircraft  for  alert  once  the  aircraft  servicing  is  complete.    A  new  preflight  is  not required until the end of the preflight validity period. 82 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 6.23.4.4.2.  Alpha-2.  Maintenance action required.  If the preflight validity period has time  remaining,  the  aircrew  may  seal  the  aircraft  after  a  thorough  inspection  of maintenance actions. 6.23.4.4.3.  Alpha-3.    Prolonged  maintenance  required.    If  major  maintenance  is accomplished,  accomplish  preflight  inspections  IAW  paragraph  6.22.    If  minor maintenance is accomplished and the preflight validity period has time remaining, the aircrew may seal the aircraft after a thorough inspection of maintenance actions. 6.23.5.  Units must prepare a DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance, Form F, for the alert aircraft.  (T-2).   Alert  crews are  authorized to  load TOLD using the worst weather conditions  expected  for  the  alert  period.    Use  the  TOLD  for  alert  scrambles.    If  the  alert aircraft is flown for other reasons, use TOLD for the existing weather conditions. 6.23.6.  Consider  alert  aircraft  off-limits  to  all  personnel  except  alert  crewmembers.    No maintenance  may  be  performed  on  the  aircraft  without  approval  of  the  unit/mission commander.  NOTE:  Alert LMs before the rest of the crew when cargo load warrants (i.e. T.O. 1C-130(H)J-9 section VI cargo).  Base the aircrew FDP/CDP on the LMs show time. 6.24.  Aircrew Flight Equipment and Oxygen Requirements. (T-1) 6.24.1.  The  PIC  or  designated  representative  will  ensure  appropriate  serviceable  protective clothing,  aircrew  flight  equipment,  survival,  and  Dash  21  equipment  for  the  entire  mission are  aboard  the  aircraft  and  all  personnel  are  briefed  or  trained  in  their  use  before  departing home  station  or  enroute  stations.  (T-2).    NOTE:    Local  training  missions  only  require  a preflight inspection prior to the first flight of the day. 6.24.2.  Before  departing  home  station  and  following  enroute  crew  changes,  the  PIC  must review, sign, and date the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, and verify all required equipment is on board and required inspections have been completed. (T-2).  In addition,  the  PIC  must  review  AF  Form  4076,  Aircraft  Dash  21  Equipment  Inventory,  and verify all required Dash 21 equipment has been certified as installed and initial check signed by maintenance and configuration documents match mission requirements. (T-2). 6.24.2.1.  Mission  Equipment.  When  missing  equipment  is  discovered  accomplish  the following: 6.24.2.1.1.  Make  an  AFTO  Form  781A  entry  for  equipment  found  missing.  Additionally,  ensure  equipment  removed  from  the  aircraft  at  an  enroute  station  is documented in the AFTO Form 781A. 6.24.2.1.2.  Annotate  in  the  AF  Form  4076  or  AFTO  Form  46  in  the  next  vacant column indicating the quantity remaining for the item. 6.24.2.1.3.  Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be recovered or replaced before mission continuation. 6.24.2.2.  Additional  Equipment.  If  more  equipment  is  discovered  during  the  pre-flight than is annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next vacant column for the item. 6.24.3.  Oxygen.  The  PIC  must  ensure  oxygen  on  board  for  takeoff  must  be  sufficient  to accomplish  the  planned  flight  from  the  equal  time  point  (ETP)  to  a  suitable  recovery  base, AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 83 should  oxygen  be  required  (minimum  5  liters  for  all  flights).  (T-2).    Calculate  crew requirements using the 100% Oxygen Duration Chart in the flight manual at 10,000 ft. 6.24.3.1.  Crewmembers  occupying  a  crew  station  will  have  an  oxygen  mask  (includes helmet  mask  if  primary  for  flight)  connected  and  readily  available  for  use  from  before starting  engines  until  engine  shutdown.  (T-2).    NOTE:  Crewmember  pre-flight  will include communication checks to include quick don and/or helmet and mask. (T-2). 6.24.3.2.  Normally,  unpressurized  flight  is  not  planned  above  18,000  ft  cabin  altitude (except HALO). 6.24.3.3.  Crewmembers who do not have access to the aircraft oxygen system will have an EEBD, EPOS, or other approved system within arm’s reach for flights above 10,000 ft. (T-2). 6.24.3.4.  On missions carrying passengers, distribute EPOS to each passenger regardless of planned flight altitude. Crewmembers will distribute and demonstrate the use of EPOS before departure. (T-2). 6.24.3.5.  Walk-around  bottles  are  not  considered  a  primary  source  of  supplemental oxygen  for  crewmembers  performing  duties  in  a  primary  crew  position.    Furthermore, walk-around  bottles  are  not  considered  as  a  source  of  supplemental  oxygen  for  any crewmember during unpressurized operations above 10,000 ft MSL. 6.24.3.6.  Crewmembers  will  not  remove  the  LMs  emergency  equipment  (cargo compartment quick dons/smoke masks) for use by flight deck crew members. (T-2). 6.24.4.  Life  Rafts.    On  overwater  flights,  the  PIC  must  not  carry  more  passengers  and crewmembers than wing well life rafts will accommodate. (T-2). 6.24.5.  Life Preserver Units (LPUs). The  LM will place an  LPU within easy reach of each passenger.Crewmembers  will  fit  and  adjust  LPUs  for  overwater  flights  and  wear  them  on overwater  missions  below  2,000  ft.  (except  for  takeoffs,  approaches,  or  landings).  (T-2).   NOTE:  Parachutists provide their own LPUs. The flying unit will notify the supported unit when route of flight requires the use of LPUs.  NOTE:  Infil/Exfil operations may preclude issuing  LPUs  to  user  personnel.    In  this  case,  carry  sufficient  LPUs  on  board  for  all personnel. 6.24.5.1.  Crewmembers  wearing  a  parachute  or  harness  during  air  refueling  overwater will also wear an LPU. (T-2). 6.24.5.2.  The LM must ensure the appropriate number and type of LPUs are on board for overwater missions carrying children and infants. (T-2). 6.24.6.  Anti-exposure  suits.  The  LM  will  ensure  anti-exposure  suits  are  available  during overwater flights when route of flight is beyond power-off gliding distance from land and the water  temperature  is  60°F  or  below  (except  when  only  the  approach  or  departure  is  flown over water.) (T-2). 6.24.6.1.  If  the  water  temperature  ranges  between  51°F  and  60°F,  the  unit  or  mission commander  may  waive  or  extend  the  anti-exposure  suit  requirement  after  carefully considering  factors  such  as:    climate  zone  and  existing  weather  throughout  range  of flight, operational requirements, time of flight over water, risk based on aircraft load and 84 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 configuration, mission mission, location/availability/capability of SAR forces (consider anticipated time in the water prior to pick-up), winds and wave height and their impact on SAR forces, altitude and distance from land. surveillance degree of over 6.24.7.  Parachutes  and  Restraint  Harness.  The  LM  will  configure  all  aircraft  with  one parachute for each crewmember when required.  See AFI 11-2HC-130J Vol 3 Addenda A for parachute requirements. (T-2). 6.24.7.1.  Crewmembers  should  wear  parachutes  during  combat  and  hazardous acceptance  flights.    EXCEPTION:    Unit  or  mission  commanders  may  authorize crewmembers  to  size  and  stow  their  parachutes  in  an  easily  accessible  location.    A restraint harness may be used in lieu of a parachute IAW  paragraph 6.24.7.2,  6.24.7.3 and    16.34.  However,  a  parachute  must  be  fitted  and  stowed  in  an  easily  accessible location for each crewmember using a restraint harness. (T-2). 6.24.7.2.  Personnel performing duties near an open (or suspected open) door/hatch/ramp in-flight will be restrained by a safety harness, or wear a parachute. (T-2). 6.24.7.3.  LMs  will  wear  a  restraining  harness  instead  of  a  parachute  during  airdrops below 800 ft AGL or when performing duties near an open exit above 14,000 ft MSL. (T-2).  For additional guidance see paragraph 16.34. 6.24.8.  Survival  Kits/Vests.    Configure  all  aircraft  with  one  survival  kit  (ML-4)  for  each crewmember. Use survival vests in lieu of survival kits if the mission will not be conducted beyond  gliding  distance  of  land.    Individuals  should  wear  survival  vests  on  all  combat  and contingency missions. 6.24.9.  Protective Headgear and Eye Protection. 6.24.9.1.  All crewmembers will preflight and wear their helmets during contingency and combat missions at the discretion of deployed commander. (T-2). 6.24.9.2.  Mobile  crewmembers  in  the  cargo  compartment  will  wear  helmets  with  the chinstrap  fastened  during  all  actual  airdrop  operations  from  checklist  initiation  through  completion.  (T-2).  EXCEPTION:    Helmet  is  not  required  for  SATB/non-equipment airdrop operations.  WARNING: Personnel in the cargo compartment will not be seated under the anchor cables or static line retriever cables that are rigged for use, unless cargo compartment  configuration  or  mission  requirements  dictate  otherwise.  (T-2).    In  that event,  personnel  will  wear  protective  headgear.  (T-2).    Personnel  will  not  position themselves  directly  under  the  center  anchor  cable  supports  (A-frames,  FS  737)  during personnel or equipment airdrops requiring the use of the anchor cable. (T-2). 6.24.9.3.  Eye  Protection.  All  personnel  aft  of  FS  617  will  lower  helmet  visors  or  wear eye  protection  on  all  airdrops,  PR,  HAAR,  and pyrotechnic  missions  requiring  doors  to be open. (T-2).  NVGs satisfy the requirement for eye protection. 6.25.  Cargo Documentation.  Loadmasters will ensure proper cargo documentation accompany each load. (T-2).  See Chapter 14 for more specific guidance. 6.26.  Airlifting  Hazardous  Cargo.  AFMAN  24-204,  Preparing  Hazardous  Materials  for Military  Air  Shipment,  contains  a  description  of  the  types  and  classes  of  hazardous  cargo  that may be carried.  PICs are responsible for ensuring all procedures contained in AFMAN 24-204, AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 85 AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft carrying Hazardous Materials, and any other applicable guidance are complied with when airlifting hazardous cargo. 6.26.1.  Cargo  Documentation.  PICs  will  not  accept  hazardous  materials  unless  proper documentation,  certification,  and  identification  of  the  cargo  are  provided.  (T-2).    This includes transportation control number entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods. 6.26.2.  Briefing.  Reference AFMAN 24-204. 6.26.2.1.  Placards. Reference AFMAN 24-204. 6.26.3.  Flight Planning.  Based on the Hazardous Cargo Briefing, the PIC will: 6.26.3.1.  Enter  "Hazardous  Cargo",  “Inert  Device”  (or  both),  and  the  mission  number, PPR  number,  or  flight  number  in  the  “Other  information”  or  “Remarks”  section  of  DD Form  1801  or  DD  Form  175,  unless  prohibited  by  directives  that  govern  the  area  of operation.    Refer  to  the  FCG  for  country  specific  requirements  concerning  over-flight when transporting hazardous materials cargo. 6.26.3.2.  If  possible,  plan  the  flight  to  minimize  overflying  heavily  populated  or otherwise critical areas.  Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded. 6.26.3.3.  Prepare a departure message. The PIC must include the remarks section of the departure message:  class of hazardous material, DoD class or division for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight.  (T-2).  If required, request special handling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams, etc.). 6.26.3.3.1.  If  ETE  is  less  than  1  hour,  or  if  other  circumstances  preclude  timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and information listed  above  in  paragraph  6.26.3.3.  If  available,  C2  normaly  relays  required information to the next destination. 6.26.4.  Before  Engine  Start.    Confirm  placards  are  removed.  Give  the  controlling  agency parking  location,  approximate  engine  start  time,  and  verify  the  fire-fighting  agency  has  the hazardous materials information.  If not, request the following be relayed to the fire-fighting agency:    class  of  hazardous  material,  DoD  class  or  division  for  explosives,  net  explosive weight (NEW), and estimated time of departure. 6.26.5.  Before  Landing.  Unless  specifically  prohibited  by  the  theater  commander  or  FLIP planning accomplish the following: 6.26.5.1.  Contact  base  operations,  control  tower,  approach  control,  or  other  agency specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) prior to arrival to announce that hazardous materials are on board, and to verify the appropriate base support agencies have received the departure message.   If not  received, notify the next  destination of the ETA and information listed in paragraph 6.26.3.3. 6.26.5.1.1.  If  landing  at  a  CONUS  civil  airport  without  a  tower,  give  the  previous information  to  the  nearest  FAA  flight  service  station.    Request  the  information  be relayed  immediately  to  the  civil  airport  manager,  fire-fighting  agency,  and  other support agencies (if required). 86 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 6.26.6.  Parking.  DoD requires aircraft carrying DoD Hazard Class or Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 explosives, DOT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked in areas  isolated  from  personnel.  PICs  must  correctly  identify  cargo  to  the  tower  and  ground control. (T-1).  When aircraft are not directed to an isolated area, identify the cargo again to tower or ground control.  Once identification is acknowledged, the host is solely responsible for selecting the parking area.  Should host procedures be questionable, submit trip reports, as appropriate, to document such occurrences. 6.26.7.  Unscheduled  Landing  Due  to  IFE.  In  addition  to  standard  declaration  of  the  IFE, PICs will transmit unclassified information including hazardous materials on board, location of the cargo, and applicable information listed in  paragraph 6.26.3.3 to the appropriate air traffic control facility. (T-2). 6.26.7.1.  After  unscheduled  landing,  PICs  will  contact  the  ACC  Command  Center  or theater  command  post  by  telephone,  HF  radio,  or  message,  giving  arrival  notice, hazardous materials information, and other pertinent information as required. (T-2). 6.27.  Hazardous  Medical  Equipment.  Nonstandard  hazardous  medical  equipment  possessed by  medical  facilities  using  ACC  air  evacuation  services  should  be  regarded  as  potentially hazardous.  Two types of equipment of major concern are: 6.27.1.  Electronic  Medical  Equipment.    This  type  of  equipment  produces  electromagnetic interference  (EMI) which is  commonly beyond the limits  specified by MIL  STD 461A and 462,  and  therefore  can  interfere  with  aircraft  communication  and  navigational  equipment.  For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions: 6.27.1.1.  Pararescue  personnel  must  inform  the  PIC  when  nonstandard  electronic medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft. (T-2).   In addition, the PIC must be informed of the anticipated period of use of the equipment during the mission. (T-2). 6.27.1.2.  The  PIC  must  be  alert  for  any  interference  with  aircraft  communications  or navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment. (T-2). 6.27.1.3.  If  continuous  use  of  the  equipment  is  required  throughout  the  duration  of  the mission, fly in VMC only. 6.27.2.  Therapeutic Oxygen Systems.  These systems present an increased hazard of fire or explosion.  A potential hazard is the inadvertent disruption of the cylinder neck, manifold, or regulator  resulting  in  explosion  and  propulsion  of  the  container  or  accessories.    For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions: 6.27.2.1.  The  LM  must  completely  secure  all  compressed  oxygen  equipment  with exposed,  unprotected  cylinder  neck,  manifold,  or  regulator  from  all  movement  in  its longitudinal and lateral axes. (T-2). 6.27.2.2.  Pararescue  personnel  should  continually  monitor  the  operation  of  the equipment to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude. 6.28.  Handling  of  Classified  Cargo,  Registered  Mail,  Mission  Capable  (MICAP)  Parts, Very,  Very  Important  Parts  (VVIP),  Forward  Supply  System  (FSS)  Shipments,  and Courier  Material.  MICAP,  VVIP,  sensitive  cargo,  courier  materials,  and  registered  mail moving within the normal airlift system are receipted at the on and offload stations using the air cargo manifest.   For unit moves operated IAW Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR), Part AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 87 III,  Mobility,  classified  or  sensitive  cargo  movement  is  normally  manifested  utilizing  the  DD Form  2130-2,  Cargo  Manifest  or  similar  automated  product  (such  as  CALM  or  AALPS),  and will  normally  be  accompanied  by  a  unit  courier.  However,  if  classified/sensitive  unit  cargo  is offered without an accompanying courier, use the DD1907, Signature and Tally Record. 6.28.1.  Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are authorized to designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military aircraft as couriers to escort  and  safeguard  courier  material  when  other  qualified  personnel  are  not  available.  Qualified  passengers,  if  carried,  are  designated  before  designating  crewmembers.    The following restrictions apply: 6.28.1.1.  Primary  crewmembers  will  not  be  designated  couriers  without  the  consent  of the PIC. (T-2). 6.28.1.2.  Crewmembers  on  aircraft  scheduled  to  make  an  extended  enroute  stop  at  a location  where  DCS  couriers  cannot  provide  enroute  support  will  not  be  designated  as couriers. (T-2). 6.28.2.  During  stops  at  enroute  locations  supported  by  DCS  stations,  DCS  couriers  are required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material. 6.28.2.1.  During unscheduled enroute stops crewmembers may place courier material in temporary custody of the following agencies in descending order of priority: 6.28.2.1.1.  DCS courier. 6.28.2.1.2.  TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces. 6.28.2.1.3.  US Department of State Diplomatic Courier. 6.28.2.1.4.  US Department of State activity. 6.28.2.1.5.  US military guards. 6.28.2.1.6.  US DoD civilian guards. 6.28.3.  If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or material is  lost,  stolen  or  otherwise  compromised,  the  PIC  will  report  circumstances  to  the  nearest DCS station and notify the local US military commander or US Government activity. (T-2). 6.28.4.  Life  or  death  urgency  shipments  consist  of  biological  or  other  medical  supplies  of such  urgency  that  human  life  is  dependent  upon  immediate  receipt.    The  LM  will  manifest shipments  separately  and  the  manifest  annotated  with  the  words  LIFE  OR  DEATH URGENCY. (T-2). The LM will handle all shipments on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the air cargo manifest or the DD 1907, for unit moves. (T-2).  The PIC will be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and be made the custodian during flight. (T-2). Section 6D—Departure 6.29.  On  Time  Takeoffs.  Mission  departures are on time if airborne no  later than 15 minutes after the scheduled takeoff time.  PICs may depart up to 30 minutes early provided the aircrew evaluates local and down-range impacts and no adverse effect results. 6.30.  NVG Departures. 88 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 6.30.1.  NVG  Departure  Weather  Minimums.    Pilots  may  use  NVGs  to  assist  in  instrument takeoffs as mission requirements dictate.  Weather minimums for NVG departures for pilots who are current and qualified is  1 mile visibility.  Weather minimums  for NVG departures for  pilots  who  are  non-current  or  unqualified  is  1500/3.    Crews  should  give  careful consideration  to  potential  hazards  during  this  critical  phase  of  flight.    Other  weather limitations  are  IAW  this  instruction  and  AFI  11-202V3.    NVGs  have  inherent  limitations which  can  further  be  reduced  by  poor  weather  conditions.    Crews  will  consider  weather conditions, moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting, and weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations. 6.30.2.  NVG Malfunctions During Takeoff.  During an NVG takeoff, if the PF experiences NVG  failure,  takeoff  may  be  continued  at  the  discretion  of  the  PIC.    If  NVG  malfunctions occur  after  the  PM  states  “rotate,”  consideration  should  be  given  to  either  continuing  the takeoff  as  an  overt  instrument  takeoff  or  transferring  control  of  the  aircraft  as  the  situation dictates.    If  either  pilot’s  NVGs  fail  after  takeoff,  continue  the  climb  out  and  follow  the appropriate  procedures  for  loss  of  NVGs.  The  PM  will  be  ready  to  immediately  assume aircraft  control  if  the  PF  experiences  spatial  disorientation  or  an  NVG  malfunction.  (T-2).  WARNING:  NVGs  and  associated  components  (battery  cords,  safety  cords,  and  other hardware)  can  become  entangled  with  the  fire  handles,  overhead  panel  switches,  or  other controls. 6.31.  Departure Monitoring.  The CSO and PM will back up the PF and report any deviations from the planned departure. (T-2).  Section 6E—En Route 6.32.  IFF/SIF Operations. (T-2) 6.32.1.  Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode IV when required for mission accomplishment. (T-2).  Conduct an operational ground test of the Mode IV using either the self-test or ground radar interrogator (ground test assets permitting).  If the self-test fails and radar  facilities  do  not  permit  a  ground  check,  takeoff  is  authorized  if  the  IFF/SIF  was operational  on  the  previous  mission.    Accomplish  an  airborne  check  immediately  after takeoff. 6.32.1.1.  Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode IV before takeoff.  Do not delay takeoff or cancel  a  mission  for  an  inoperable  Mode  IV,  except  when  the  aircraft  is  scheduled  to transit an area where safe passage procedures are implemented. 6.32.2.  Aircraft with inoperable Mode IV may continue to their intended destination if use is no longer required. If use is mandatory, the PIC must ensure repairs are accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance technicians are available. (T-2).  In theaters  where  safe  passage  is  implemented,  follow  procedures  for  inoperable  Mode  IV  as directed in the applicable Airspace Control Order or Air Tasking Order. 6.32.3.  PICs will use the IFF/SIF IAW Table 6.5. (T-2).   NOTE:  Once set and transmitted, IFF/SIF modes 1, 2, and 3/A codes are unclassified and may be left in the transponder. Table 6.5.

Flight Progress.  In-flight, use all available navigation aids to monitor Mission Computer performance.  Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability that degrades centerline accuracy to the controlling radar facility.  See  Chapter 11 for procedures to monitor flight progress. 6.33.1.  Operations in International/Territorial Airspace.  (See FLIP, FCG, and AP for further guidance).  US  military  aircraft  and  DoD  personnel  entering  another  nation  to  conduct  US government  business  must  have  the  approval  of  the  foreign  government  concerned  to  enter their  airspace.  (T-0).    Foreign  clearances  for  US  international  air  operations  are  obtained through US officials known as Defense Attaché Officers (DAOs). 6.33.1.1.  There  are  essentially  two  types  of  airspace:    international  airspace  and territorial airspace.  International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states’ territorial  seas.  Military aircraft operate in  such areas free of interference or control by the coastal state.  Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters,  inland  waters,  and  land  territory,  and  is  sovereign  airspace.    Overflight  may  be conducted  in  such  areas  only  with  consent  of  the  sovereign  country,  except  under customary  international  law  which  permits  state  aircraft  in  distress  to  make  emergency landings in foreign territory without affirmative authorization or right of assistance entry (see CJCSI 2410.01D, Guidance for the Exercise of Right of Assistance Entry. 6.33.1.2.  Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12 NMs.  Diplomatic  constraints  and/or  a  lack  of  diplomatic  clearances  usually  result  in  missions operating in  international  airspace.  Therefore, it is  imperative sufficient  information be provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established by  the  countries  concerned.    The  U.S.  claims  a  12  NM  territorial  sea  and  recognizes territorial sea claims of other nations up to a maximum breadth of 12 NM. 6.33.1.3.  Flight  Information  Region  (FIR).    A  FIR  is  an  area  of  airspace  within  which flight information and related services are provided.  A FIR does not reflect international borders  or  sovereign  airspace.    Aircraft  may  operate  within  an  established  FIR  without approval of the adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in territorial airspace. 6.33.1.4.  Aircrews  on  a  flight  plan  route,  which  takes  them  from  international  airspace into territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not amend entry point(s). 90 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 6.33.1.5.  Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or departure  of  aircraft.    Aircrews  should  not  enter  into  territorial  airspace  for  which  a clearance  has  not  been  duly  requested  and  granted  through  diplomatic  channels  apart from emergency landing and right of assistance entry as noted in paragraph 6.33.1.1. 6.33.1.6.  ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is mandatory from the respective country.  Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only. 6.33.1.7.  In  the  event  an  ATC  agency  challenges  the  validity  of  a  flight  routing  or attempts  to  negate  existing  clearances,  PICs  should  evaluate  the  circumstances.    The normal response is to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft is continuing to planned  destination,  as  cleared  in  international  airspace.    The  key  phrase  is  “in international  airspace.”   Safety  of  flight  is  paramount  in  determining  mission continuation.  Under no circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance, which routes their  mission  over  sovereign  airspace  not  approved  through  diplomatic  channels  before mission departure, as being valid authorization. 6.33.1.8.  Aircrews  operating  missions  requiring  unique  or  specially  developed  routing are  normally  briefed  at  home  station,  onload  station,  and/or  by  the  last  C2  facility transited before performing the critical portion of the mission. 6.33.1.9.  Due  Regard  Procedures.    Aircrews  normally  are  not  tasked  to  and  should  not fly “due regard” routings unless coordinated and authorized by the unit commander.  The “due regard” or “operational” option obligates the military aircraft to be their own ATC agency  to  separate  their  aircraft  from  all  other  air  traffic.    If  operational  requirements dictate,  the  PIC  may  exercise  the  “due  regard”  option  to  protect  their  aircraft.    The aircraft  returns  to  normal  air  traffic  services  as  soon  as  practical.    Fly  “due  regard” procedures  IAW  AFI  11-202V3  and  FLIP  GP  “Operations  and  Firings  over  the  High Seas.” 6.34.  Cold Weather Altimeter Setting  Procedures.  Apply cold weather altimeter corrections for non-tactical operations IAW AFI 11-202V3 and FIH. 6.35.  Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Operations.  Comply with AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules. 6.35.1.  Mission requirements may allow selection of TA Only when operating from parallel runways, in the visual traffic pattern, or during air refueling operations since the proximity to aircraft may result in unwarranted RAs.  In addition, excessive climb/descent rates could lead to an inadvertent TA/RA.  Reducing climb/descent rates near level off can limit inadvertent TCAS advisories. 6.36.  Navigational  Aid  Capability.  The  following  airspace  categories  are  each  defined  in FLIP,  and  are  considered  special  qualification  airspace:    MNPS,  RVSM,  RNP,  and  BRNAV.  For further details about specific airspace procedures and restrictions, see Chapter 11. 6.37.  Communications.  Crewmembers will make all communications IAW FLIP or as directed by the controlling agency. (T-2). 6.37.1.  Crews  should  conduct  an  HF  radio  ground  check  before  takeoff  if  use  of  the  HF radio  may  be  required  for  ATC  or  C2  communications.    Attempt  to  establish  HF  contact AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 91 before going out of UHF/VHF range.  If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling HF station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC information is not available, the aircraft should return to the nearest suitable support base. 6.38.  Communications  Instructions  Reporting  Vital  Intelligence  Sightings  and  Other Reports. 6.38.1.  Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FIH. 6.38.2.  In-flight  harassment  or  hostile  action  against  aircraft.  Aircraft  subjected  to harassment  or  hostile  action  by  foreign  aircraft  will  immediately  contact  the  nearest  USAF air  and  ground  voice  facility  and  report  the  encounter.  (T-2).    Include  aircraft  nationality, type,  insignia,  or  any  other  identifying  features;  note  position,  heading,  time,  speed  when harassed,  and  type  of  harassment.    Request  relay  of  the  report  to  the  nearest  C2  agency.  Also, attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range. 6.38.3.  Other  incidents  are  reported  as  indicated  in  JCS  Pub  6V5  and  AFI  10-206, Operational Reporting. 6.39.  In-Flight  Meals.  Pilots  should  not  consume  meals  at  the  same  time,  and  their  meals should consist of different menu items. 6.40.  In-Flight  Emergency  (IFE)  Procedures.  Crews  will  report  deviations  from  directives that occur as a result of an emergency IAW AFI 11-202V3, and this instruction. (T-2). 6.40.1.  Notification  of  Controlling  Agencies.    As  soon  as  practical  after  completing  the aircraft emergency action checklist, PICs will furnish the controlling agency and appropriate C2  agencies  with  a  description  and  extent  of  the  difficulty,  assistance  required,  intentions, and any other pertinent information. (T-2). 6.40.2.  The  PIC  may  initiate  a  CONFERENCE  HOTEL  when  additional  expertise  is necessary.  This procedure makes aircraft specialists accessible to the aircrew when in-flight situations pose systems-related questions that cannot be answered at the local level.  See AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision, for contact information and further details. 6.40.2.1.  When in  UHF or VHF range, initiate the conference over appropriate discrete frequencies.  When out of VHF or UHF range, use HF radios to establish a phone patch with the nearest or controlling C2 agency.  Provide a narrative description of the situation including actions taken, intentions, and type of expertise desired. 6.40.3.  Turnaround  Procedures.    When  a  turnaround  is  necessary,  use  procedures  in  FLIP.  Maintain VFR, reverse course, climb or descend to a VFR altitude or flight level and request ATC  clearance.    If  unable  to  maintain  VFR,  obtain  an  ATC  clearance  before  reversing course.  A turnaround under IFR conditions, without ATC approval, can be made only after a thorough evaluation of the seriousness of the emergency, general traffic density, and known traffic operating in the immediate area.  Normally, a climb or descent (with minimum change in altitude) to a VFR altitude or flight level results in minimum exposure to other aircraft. 6.40.4.  Continued  Flight  with  Engine  Loss.    A  flight  may  proceed  on  three  engines  to  its destination  if  two-engine  capability  exists,  favorable  operating  conditions  prevail  both enroute and at the point of intended landing, and a suitable alternate airfield is available at all times.  If  these  conditions  cannot  be  met,  the  PIC  will  terminate  the  flight  at  the  nearest 92 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 facility  (preferably  military)  which,  in  the  judgment  of  the  PIC,  offers  safe  and  favorable operating conditions. (T-2). 6.40.5.  Fuel Jettison. PICs will not jettison fuel except in combat, emergency conditions, or rescue missions requiring gross weight reduction. (T-2). 6.40.5.1.  Advise ATC should it become necessary to jettison fuel. 6.41.  Need for Medical Assistance.  When a person on board the aircraft requires medical care, PICs will include in the notification to the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical  personnel  may  meet  the  aircraft.  (T-2).    Notification  will  include  the  individual’s  sex, approximate age, and the nature of the medical problem. 6.41.1.  Suspected  Laser  Exposure.  If  laser  exposure  is  suspected,  ensure  appropriate  C2, intelligence,  safety,  and  medical  agencies  are  notified  as  soon  as  possible.    Aircrew  who suspect exposure to laser radiation from either friendly or hostile sources should report to the Flight Surgeon’s office or nearest emergency room where the individual can be examined by an ophthalmologist immediately upon landing. 6.42.  Weather Forecasts.  The PIC will ensure destination weather is obtained prior to descent for  landing.  (T-2).  NOTE:  For  all  flights  outside  the  local  area,  the  CSO/PM  will  obtain  the destination  and  alternate  (if  applicable)  forecasts,  to  include  pressure  altitude  and  temperature, before reaching the equal time point and one hour prior to ETA. (T-2). 6.42.1.  The  primary  sources  for  in-flight  weather  assistance  are  Operational  Weather Squadron (OWS), Pilot-to-Meteorological Service (PMSV), or through a USAF aeronautical station.    Refer  to  the  FIH  or  Air  Force  Visual  Aid  (AFVA)  15-137,  Operational  Weather Squadron Areas of Responsibility, for servicing OWS contact information.  The ATC system can provide weather information to enroute aircraft. Section 6F—Arrival 6.43.  Descent.  Crews  should  plan  and  initiate  their  descent  to  comply  with  ATC  arrival  and instrument  approach  procedures.  Before  descent  into  unfamiliar  areas,  pilots  and  CSO  will review appropriate terrain charts to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions. (T-2). Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other than aircraft  operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from the initial descent point to landing.  (T-2).    The  PM  and  CSO  will  monitor  the  approach  and  report  any  deviations  from  prescribed procedures. (T-2).   6.43.1.  Crosscheck  radar  altimeters  during  descent  to  verify  adequate  terrain  clearance throughout the descent and maneuvering portion of the approach. 6.43.2.  Night  and  Marginal  Weather  Operations.  Fly  a  precision  approach,  if  available,  at night or during marginal weather.  If a precision approach is not available, fly any available approved  instrument  approach.    A  visual  approach  may  be  flown  during  night  VFR conditions  if  an  approved  instrument  approach  is  not  available  or  operational/training requirements dictate. 6.44.  Instrument Approach Procedures. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 93 6.44.1.  Aircraft category.  The HC-130J is a category "C" aircraft. If approach speeds exceed 140 knots, use the minimums for category "D". 6.44.2.  Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3. (T-2). 6.44.3.  Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an enroute descent, confirm the existing weather is reported to be: 6.44.3.1.  At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches. 6.44.3.1.1.  For  PAR  approaches,  visibility  can  be  no  lower  than  RVR  2400  (730 meters) or ½ mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available. 6.44.3.1.2.  CAT  I  ILS  Procedures.    Decision  height  for  precision  approaches  is  as published, but no lower than a 200 ft height above touchdown (HAT). 6.44.3.2.  At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches. 6.44.3.2.1.  For  circling  approaches  with  no  published  ceiling  requirement,  the required ceiling is computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 ft rounded up to the next one hundred foot value.  (For example, if the HAA is 747 ft, add 100 ft to get 847 ft and then round up to the next one hundred foot value which would be 900 ft.  Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900 ft.)  When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach minimums are as published, but in no case lower than: 6.44.3.2.1.1.  Category C - 500 ft - 1 1/2 SM. 6.44.3.2.1.2.  Category D - 600 ft - 2 SM. 6.44.3.3.  Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½ SM or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway approach lighting system (ALS) is inoperative.  (This applies only to the ALS itself, not to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.) 6.44.4.  Flight Instrumentation Requirements. 6.44.4.1.  Full flight instrumentation for a CAT I ILS and precision approach radar (PAR) includes a HUD or PFD at each station, and no shared CADC or INU attitude reference. 6.44.4.2.  Full  flight  instrumentation  for  a  CAT  II  ILS  includes  an  operational  HUD  in the PF position, a HUD or PFD at the PM position, and meeting the flight manual CAT II ILS criteria. 6.44.4.3.  Aircraft are limited to a DH/MDA based on a HAT of 300 ft and RVR 4000 or 3/4  SM  visibility  (1220  meters)  with  no  RVR  if  full  flight  instrumentation  is  not operational. 6.44.5.  ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches.  Both pilots must be certified to conduct an ILS PRM approach. Comply with the following operational procedures: 6.44.5.1.  Two operational VHF communication radios are mandatory. 6.44.5.2.  The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach. 94 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 6.44.5.3.  If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA ATCSCC at  800-333-4286 prior to  departure time to  obtain a pre-coordinated arrival  time.  Pilots who  arrive  at  a  PRM  airport  unable  to  accept  PRM  approach  clearance  and  did  not contact  ATC  prior  to  departure,  should  expect  an  ATC  directed  divert  to  a  non-PRM airport. 6.44.5.4.  All  breakouts  from  the  approach  are  hand  flown.    Autopilots  are  disengaged when a breakout is commanded. 6.44.5.5.  Should  a  TCAS  Resolution  Advisory  (RA)  be  received,  the  PF  shall immediately  respond  to  the  RA.  (T-0).    If  following  an  RA  requires  deviating  from  an ATC clearance, the PM shall advise ATC as soon as practical. (T-0).  While following an RA,  comply  with  the  turn  portion  of  the  ATC  breakout  instruction  unless  the  PF determines safety to be a factor. 6.44.6.  CAT  II  ILS  Procedures.    DH  is  based  on  radar  altitude.    Minimum  HAT  is  100  ft.  Minimum RVR is 1200.  Maximum crosswind limitation is 10 knots.  Crosswind of 15 knots may be used for training approaches (requires weather of 200 – ½ or greater). 6.44.6.1.  PICs must confirm the following airfield and aircraft equipment are operational (AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures). 6.44.6.1.1.  Approach lights. 6.44.6.1.2.  Runway centerline lighting. 6.44.6.1.3.  High intensity runway lights or touchdown zone lights. 6.44.6.1.4.  Approach end transmissometer. 6.44.6.1.5.  ILS far field monitor. 6.44.6.1.6.  Sequenced flashers. 6.44.6.2.  Do  not  execute  an  IMC  CAT  II  ILS  to  minimums  unless  both  pilots  are qualified and current in Category II ILS. 6.44.6.3.  When  performing  CAT training/evaluations, the DH is the HAT for the CAT I ILS. II ILS  procedures  on  a  CAT I ILS for 6.44.6.4.  Refer to AFI 11-217V1 regarding equipment failure and go-around criteria. 6.44.7.  NDB Procedures.  The HUD alone is not sufficient for NDB approaches. Use a head-down  display,  which  depicts  a  bearing  pointer  tuned  to  the  NDB,  in  conjunction  with  the HUD  throughout  the  approach.    NDB  approaches  may  be  flown  during  day,  night,  or  IMC conditions  after  compliance  with  any  airfield  restrictions  in  GDSS2/ASRR.    Pilots  should back  up  each  approach  with  available  NAVAIDSs/GPS  to  include  loading  the  NDB coordinates in the FMS. 6.45.  After  Beginning  an  Enroute  Descent.  Do  not  continue  a  CAT  II  ILS  if  the  weather  is reported to be below CAT II minimums. 6.45.1.  Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 95 6.45.2.  If  the  approach  is  continued,  the  aircraft  must  have  sufficient  fuel  to  complete  the approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal fuel reserve. 6.45.3.  Holding.  An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but forecast to improve to at or above minimums provided: 6.45.3.1.  The  aircraft  has  more  fuel  remaining  than  that  required  to  fly  to  the  alternate and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time. 6.45.3.2.  Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel is consumed. 6.46.  NVG Approach and Landing. 6.46.1.  NVG  Approach  Weather  Minimums.    Weather  minimums  for  NVG  visual approaches, NVG visual pattern work, and pilots  who are non-current  and/or unqualified is 1500/3.  Current and qualified NVG pilots may fly IFR approaches with weather at approach minimums.  Crews should give careful consideration to potential hazards during this critical phase  of  flight.    Other  weather  limitations  are  IAW  this  instruction  and  AFI  11-202V3.  NVGs  have  inherent  limitations  which  can  further  be  reduced  by  poor  weather  conditions.  Crews  consider  weather  conditions,  moon  illumination  and  position,  sky  glow  at  dawn  and dusk, cultural lighting, and weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations. 6.46.2.  NVG  Malfunction  during  Approach  and  Landing.    If  either  pilot  experiences  NVG failure on short final, it is at the discretion of the PIC whether or not to transition to an overt landing  or  perform  a  go-around.  The  PM  will  be  ready  to  immediately  assume  aircraft control if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction. (T-2).  If the PFs NVGs  fail  after  touchdown,  transfer  control  of  the  aircraft  to  the  PM,  if  required,  for  the landing rollout.  Use overt landing and taxi lights for illumination until both pilots are ready to resume NVG operations. 6.47.  Salt Spray and Clear Water Rinse.  The accumulation of salt spray on windshields and side windows is  a hazard that should be considered for low-level  overwater flight.   Weigh this against  mission  urgency  prior  to  descent  below  500  ft,  when  heavy  seas  or  high  surface  winds exist.  In some cases, it is preferable to fly at a higher altitude to avoid this condition. 6.47.1.  Crews should use a clear water rinse facility (birdbath) after every flight in which the aircraft  is  flown  over  salt  water  below  3,000  ft  AGL,  including  tactical  approaches  and landings.  Two  or  more  approaches  over  salt  water  require  a  clear  water  rinse  after  the  last flight  of  the  day  IAW  T.O.  1-1-691,  Cleaning  and  Corrosion  Prevention  and  Control, Aerospace and Non-Aerospace Equipment. 6.47.2.  If a birdbath facility is unavailable make the following annotation in the AFTO Form 781A, “Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray, Birdbath Unavailable.” 6.47.3.  Clear water rinse facility (birdbath) usage guidelines are as follows: 6.47.3.1.  Deactivate all sensors, such as the LPCR and stow the EO-IR, prior to entering the birdbath. 6.47.3.2.  The APU remains off with doors closed to prevent flameout and flooding of the APU compartment. 96 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 6.47.3.3.  Set flaps to 100% and switch off and extend landing lights. 6.47.3.4.  All  four  engines  should  be  at  normal  ground  idle.    Two  engines  in  normal ground  idle,  and  two  in  LSGI  may  be  used  if  aircraft  weight  does  not  restrict  forward movement through the bath. 6.47.3.5.  As  full  water  spray  begins,  taxi  slowly  on  centerline  at  a  rate  which  allows adequate rinsing of the aircraft.  Hold nose wheel steering centered and start windshield wipers.  Exercise flight controls while in the birdbath. 6.47.3.6.  Complete  the  AFTER  LANDING  checklist  after  rinse  is  completed.    Run engines at normal ground idle for a minimum of two minutes to aid in drying out engine nacelles.      NOTE:    Each  birdbath  is  unique  in  design  and  function.    Review  local procedures  for  birdbath  operating  guidelines  including  direction  of  entry,  wing  tip clearance criteria, and noise abatement concerns.  NOTE:  It is possible to experience an overheat indication during or immediately following the birdbath due to water intrusion into  overheat  warning  systems.    Each  crew  should  analyze  the  indication  and  make  a judgment as to the emergency action to be taken. 6.48.  Maintenance.  Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing, the PIC and any  crewmembers  documenting  a  maintenance  discrepancy  will  debrief  maintenance  personnel on  the  condition  of  the  aircraft  and  subsystems  as  required.  (T-2).    The  PIC  will  review  the aircraft forms, determine those discrepancies considered as mission essential, and indicate them by entering “ME” in block letters in the lower left hand corner of the discrepancy block.  (T-2).   Enter  “MC”  for  mission  contributing  discrepancies  to  indicate  any  discrepancies  that,  if  not corrected, would substantially  affect  mission accomplishment,  but are not  mission essential. At stations where there is no maintenance, and maintenance support is necessary, ensure a thorough debrief is provided to the controlling C2 agency prior to entering crew rest. 6.48.1.  Documentation of Fuel Onload/Offload.  Document all fuel onloaded/offloaded in the AFTO Form 781H. 6.49.  Aircraft  Recovery  Away  from  Main  Operating  Base.  Ensure  the  aircraft  is  turned  to meet subsequent mission taskings, even when qualified maintenance specialists are unavailable. 6.49.1.  The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including: 6.49.1.1.  Parking and receiving. 6.49.1.2.  Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage. 6.49.1.3.  Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability. 6.49.1.4.  Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking. 6.49.1.5.  Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest. 6.49.1.6.  Coordinating aircraft security requirements. 6.49.1.7.  Documenting AFTO 781-series forms. 6.49.2.  In  all  cases  where  aircrews  must  service  the  aircraft  without  qualified  maintenance specialist assistance, comply with the appropriate maintenance T.O. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 97 6.49.3.  Aircrews are not qualified to  accomplish the required  ground inspections.   In those instances  where  maintenance  personnel  are  not  available,  the  aircrew  will  enter  a  red  dash symbol  in  the  AFTO  Form  781H,  Aerospace  Vehicle  Flight  Status  and  Maintenance Document,  updating  current  status  and  enter  a  red  dash  symbol  and  a  discrepancy  that reflects  that  the  applicable  maintenance  inspection  (i.e.  preflight,  thru-flight,  basic  post-flight) is overdue. (T-2). 6.50.  Crew Debriefing.  The PIC will conduct a debriefing after each mission. (T-2).  Include in the  debriefing  all  applicable  crewmembers  so  that  common  problems  can  be  discussed  and resolved.  Crewmembers may be excused from debrief at the discretion of the PIC. 6.51.  Border  Clearance.  The  border  clearance  responsibility  is  as  designated  by  the  base  or area command IAW DTR 4500.9R,  Defense Transportation Regulation, Part V, Department of Defense  Customs  and  Border  Clearance  Policy  and  Procedures,  AFI  24-203,  Preparation  and Movement  of  Air  Force  Cargo,  applicable  FCG,  and  other  US  entry  requirements  and  related areas. 6.51.1.  Normal Operations. 6.51.1.1.  The  unit  dispatching  the  mission  is  normally  responsible  for  the  border clearance of its aircraft. 6.51.1.2.  When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.  Duties  may  be  assigned  to  ground  personnel  or  the  LM,  but  the  PIC  retains  ultimate responsibility.    When  an  HC-130J  aircraft  is  on-loaded  at  a  base  without  an  air  traffic function, comply with the following: 6.51.1.2.1.  Crewmembers and passengers possess current passports and valid visas, if required. 6.51.1.2.2.  Crewmembers  and  passengers  have  current  certificates  of  immunization (shot records). 6.51.1.2.3.  Cargo entry documents are in proper order. 6.51.1.2.4.  Departure  or  arrival  to  the  US  is  through  a  port  of  entry  where  border clearance can be obtained. 6.51.1.2.5.  Border  clearance  for  aircraft  cargo,  passengers,  crew  and  baggage,  if required,  is  obtained  before  takeoff  to  a  foreign  area,  or  after  arrival  from  a  foreign area. 6.51.1.2.6.  Aircraft  spraying  is  accomplished,  if  required  (see  FCG  and  paragraph 6.52). 6.51.2.  Procedures for US Entry. 6.51.2.1.  Enroute:  Distribute  personal  customs  declarations  to  all  passengers  and crewmembers.  Brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and prepare and compile necessary border clearance forms for the PICs signature. 6.51.2.2.  Enroute, notify the base of intended landing of any  change in  ETA, to  ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing. 98 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 6.51.2.3.  The PIC must obtain a Permit to Proceed when the mission requires an aircraft, which  has  landed  in  the  US  for  customs  clearance,  to  proceed  to  another  US  base  to obtain  border  clearance.  (T-2).    The  permit  delays  customs  inspection  of  cargo, passengers,  and  crew  until  arrival  at  the  offload  station,  saving  intermediate  offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection.  The permit is valid only to the airport  of  next  landing,  where  the  border  clearance  is  completed,  or  a  new  permit obtained.  Do not make intermediate stops unless required by an emergency, or directed by the controlling agency. 6.51.2.4.  When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative normally meets the aircraft to obtain the required documents.  Do not deplane passengers or  crewmembers  unless  necessary  for  safety  (i.e.  flare  safety  check)  or  preservation  of life and property. Do not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their designated representatives.  This  procedure  applies to  the initial  landing in  the US and  all  subsequent  landings  until  crew,  passengers,  and  cargo  complete  final  border clearance. 6.51.3.  Inspections of US Aircraft by Foreign Officials. 6.51.3.1.  Follow  USAF  policy  on  status  of  military  aircraft  as  stated  in  chapter  3 (General  Information)  of  the  FCG.    This  policy  holds  that  US  military  aircraft  are immune  from  searches,  seizures,  and  inspections  (including  customs  and  safety inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, PICs must be aware of, and adhere to, any specific FCG provisions for individual countries. (T-0). 6.51.3.2.  If  confronted  with  a  search  request  by  foreign  authorities,  aircrews  should consider the following procedures: 6.51.3.2.1.  In  most  cases,  search  attempts  may  be  stopped  by  a  statement  to  the foreign  officials  that  the  aircraft  is  sovereign  and  not  subject  to  search  without consent of HQ USAF or the US Department of State in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities that  may  honestly,  but  mistakenly,  believe  they  have  authority  to  search  USAF aircraft. 6.51.3.2.2.  If foreign  authorities insist  on conducting a search, make every  effort to delay the search until contact is made with HQ USAF (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate American Embassy.  The PIC should unequivocally state that  they have no authority to consent to the search and that they must relay the host nation request to  these  agencies  for  decision.    The  PIC  should  then  notify  these  agencies  of  the request  by  the  most  expeditious  means  available  and  follow  their  instructions.  NOTE:  If necessary, seal the aircraft, enter crew rest, and cancel departure intentions until resolution of the matter by the appropriate authority. 6.51.3.2.3.  If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, the PIC should indicate  that  they  would  prefer  to  fly  the  aircraft  elsewhere  (provided  fuel  and mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so. 6.51.3.2.4.  If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way on board the aircraft, the PIC should state that they protest the course of action being  pursued  and  that  they  intend  to  notify  both  HQ  USAF  and  the  appropriate AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 99 American  Embassy  of  the  foreign  action.    The  PIC  should  then  allow  the  foreign agents  onboard  the  aircraft,  without  physical  resistance,  and  thereafter  report  the incident to HQ USAF and appropriate embassy, as soon as possible.  NOTE:  Other procedures  may  apply  when  carrying  sensitive  cargo  or  equipment.    These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the FCG should be followed, where applicable. 6.51.4.  Exercise and Contingency Operations. 6.51.4.1.  General.   Certain  missions, which do not  transit normal  ports of entry or exit, require  special  procedures  to  expedite  compliance  with  customs,  public  health, immigration,  and  agricultural  requirements.    A  joint  memorandum  of  understanding establishes procedures and waivers. 6.51.4.2.  Implementation.  Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the  agreement  as  necessary  for  each  operation.    Inspection  and  clearance  may  be accomplished at the US onload or offload base instead of the normal port of entry, or at the foreign onload or offload base. 6.51.5.  Customs Procedures. 6.51.5.1.  Outbound.    No  requirement.    Filing  of  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (CBP) Form 7507 is not required unless directed. 6.51.5.2.  Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival: 6.51.5.2.1.  CBP 7507 (passenger list not required). 6.51.5.2.2.  Cargo manifest. 6.51.5.2.3.  For troops out of country less than 140 days: 6.51.5.2.3.1.  Troop commander’s certificate for examination of troop baggage. 6.51.5.2.3.2.  One  copy  of  DD  Form  1854  or  CBP  Form  6059B  for  each passenger  not  under  command  of  the  troop  commander,  to  include  observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crewmembers. 6.51.5.2.3.3.  Upon  arrival  at  a  CONUS  offload  base,  a  customs  representative will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander's certificate with respect to troop  baggage.    Individual  baggage  declarations  are  not  required.    The  troop commander  should  have  inspected  troop  baggage.  Troops  debark  under  the observation  of  the  customs  representative  with  only  a  spot  check  of  articles  and baggage. The customs officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection. 6.51.5.2.4.  For troops out of the country 140 days or more: 6.51.5.2.4.1.  One  copy  of  DD  Form  1854  or  CBP  Form  6059B  for  each passenger and crewmember. 6.51.5.2.4.2.  Upon  arrival  at  a  CONUS  offload  base,  a  customs  representative will  meet  the  aircraft  and  collect  all  declarations.  Troops  debark  under  the observation  of  the  customs  representative,  who  may  make  discretionary examination of the baggage. 100 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 6.51.6.  Immigration Procedures. 6.51.6.1.  Outbound.  No requirement. 6.51.6.2.  Inbound. Submit the following to the Immigration inspector. 6.51.6.2.1.  One copy of CBP Form7507 6.51.7.  Agriculture Procedures. 6.51.7.1.  Outbound.  No requirement. 6.51.7.2.  Inbound.  Consult FCG. 6.51.7.2.1.  The  command  being  airlifted  instructs  troops  that  no  fresh  fruit,  milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat, and animal products can be brought into the US.  All items of troop personal gear/cargo are to be thoroughly  cleaned  of  mud,  dirt,  sand,  and  other foreign  material  before  brought  on board  the  aircraft.  Personnel  must  examine  personal  gear  and  equipment  for  snails and other plant pests to prevent their accidental entry into the US. (T-2).  6.51.7.2.2.  Before  loading,  the  command  responsible  for  cargo  being  airlifted  will clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil. (T-2). 6.51.7.2.3.  When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or higher HQ, the conduct an aerosol treatment 30 minutes before landing. 6.51.7.2.4.  On  arrival,  agricultural  inspectors  inspect  the  aircraft  after  troops  have disembarked.  Crewmembers  assemble  remains  of  in-flight  lunches  for  prompt removal by fleet service personnel. 6.51.7.2.5.  Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as offloaded.  Any items found to be contaminated can be held for such treatment as the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical cleaning, or fumigation). 6.51.8.  Military Customs Preclearance Inspection Program. 6.51.8.1.  The military customs program  outlined in  DTR 4500.9R Part  V,  chapter  506 was  developed  to  assist  DoD  and  other  US  Government  agencies  in  the  control  of narcotics, contraband, and prohibited agricultural products, and to expedite entry of DoD personnel and material into the customs territory of the US. 6.51.8.2.  Military  customs  inspectors  accomplish  this  inspection  immediately  prior  to departure  and  may  conduct  more  than  one  preclearance  inspection  on  CONUS-bound aircraft.    When  security  considerations  necessitate  deviation  from  this  policy,  mission planners  must  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  agency  to  prevent  jeopardizing  the mission. 6.52.  Insect and Pest Control (Aircraft Spraying).  (T-1) 6.52.1.  Responsibility.  The  PIC  will  ensure  required  spraying  is  accomplished  IAW  AFJI 48-104,  Quarantine  Regulations  of  the  Armed  Forces,  FCG,  or  as  directed  by  higher headquarters. (T-2).  Certify the spraying on CBP Form 7507, or on forms provided by the country  transited.    Aircraft  should  never  be  sprayed  with  passengers  on  board.    The  only exception is when when mandated by the FCG. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 101 6.52.1.1.  When  spraying  is  necessary,  use  insecticide,  Aerosol  D-Phenothrin-2%,  NSN 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.  Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying. 6.52.1.1.1.  Aerosol is normally dispersed at a flow rate of 10 seconds per 1,000 cubic ft.  Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed.  Do not spray plastic surfaces. 6.52.1.1.2.  Spray  spaces  inaccessible  from  within  the  aircraft  after  completely loading fuel, baggage, and cargo, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other similar spaces. 6.52.1.1.3.  Spray the cabin (aft to forward), flight deck, and other spaces accessible from  within  the  aircraft  ensuring  all  doors,  windows,  hatches,  and  ventilation openings are closed.  Exit and close the crew entrance door when complete.  Keep all doors and hatches closed for 10 minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on board.    WARNING: Aerosol D-Phenothrin-2% contains hazardous  ingredients  that  when  exposed  for  prolonged  periods  may  become hazardous to humans. 6.52.1.2.  Spray for 50 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being transited.    NOTE:    Keep  used  aerosol  cans  separate  from  other  trash  so  they  may  be disposed of safely. 6.52.2.  When  seeing  any  insect  or  rodent  infestation  of  the  aircraft  in-flight,  notify  the destination C2 center, airfield management, or airport manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft. 6.52.3.  Upon arrival, do not open doors or hatches except to enplane officials inspecting the aircraft  for  insect  or  rodent  infestation.    Do  not  onload  or  offload  until  the  inspection  is satisfactorily  completed.    This  procedure  may  be  altered  to  satisfy  mission  or  local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager. Section 6G—Miscellaneous Procedures 6.53.  Dropped  Objects.  During  aircraft  exterior  visual  inspections,  pay  particular  attention  to surfaces,  panels,  and  components,  which  could  potentially  be  dropped  objects.    If  a  dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will: 6.53.1.  Enter a write-up in the AFTO Form 781A. 6.53.2.  Notify  the  C2  agency  as  soon  as  practical.    Include  route  of  flight,  altitude,  and weather conditions (i.e., turbulence, etc.). 6.54.  Cockpit  Voice  Recorder  (CVR).  If  involved  in  a  mishap  or  incident,  after  landing  and terminating the emergency, PICs must pull the CVR power circuit breaker (ECB #464). (T-2). 6.55.  Impoundment  of  Aircraft.  If  an  aircraft  is  involved  in  a  serious  ground  or  in-flight incident,  the  PIC  should  impound  the  aircraft  immediately  and  contact  the  ACC  Command Center or controlling agency for further instructions. 102 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 6.56.  Aircrew  Notification  Procedures.  When  transiting  installations,  establish  a  point  of contact  with  the  C2  agency,  base  operations,  or  local  airport  manager.    Notify  the  PIC immediately in case of incident or emergency affecting the safety or security of the aircraft. 6.57.  Flight Deck Loose Objects.  Comply with the following: 6.57.1.  Do not  place any  items  (checklists, charts, etc.) on the center pedestal in  a position that covers or hides any switch or light from view.  Do not place any item behind the power levers. 6.57.2.  Do not place any items (checklists, charts, etc.) on the flight deck glare shield. 6.57.3.  Do not hang any item on the flight deck escape ladder higher than the second from the bottom rung. 6.57.4.  Store  only  the  minimum  amount  of  professional  gear  required  to  accomplish  the mission on the flight deck.  Additional items are secured in the cargo compartment. 6.58.  Ordnance  Procedures.  Conduct  the  following  procedures  after  the  live  firing  of chaff/flares on the HC-130J aircraft: 6.58.1.  After landing, the pilot will taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location to check for hung ordnance. (T-2). 6.58.2.  The LM or another qualified crewmember will deplane and check all dispensers for hung ordnance. (T-2).  NOTE:  ALE-47 flare squibs that fail to fire are not considered hung ordnance. 6.58.3.  If hung ordnance is found, identified by  a protruding or partially  ejected chaff/flare cartridge, the aircraft will remain in a de-arm area until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel meet the aircraft. (T-2).  The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area until EOD personnel can clear all hung ordnance. (T-2). AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 103 Chapter 7 AIRCRAFT SECURITY 7.1.  General.  This  chapter  provides  guidance  on  aircraft  security,  as  well  as,  prevention  and resistance against aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the HC-130J aircraft on the ground and in-flight.  Due to the sensitive nature of anti-hijacking procedures, aircrew members should reference AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking)  (FOUO),  AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), FIH, and any MAJCOM supplements or specific security publications.  Some aircraft contain equipment and documents that require protection per DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 16-1404,  Air  Force  Information  Security  Program.  Do  not  release  any  information  concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public. 7.2.  Security.  The  HC-130J  is  a  “Protection  Level  3”  resource.    Aircraft  security  at  non-US military  installations  is  the  responsibility  of  the  controlling  agency.    Additional  equipment onboard or installed on the aircraft may result in increased security measures. 7.3.  Procedures.  The  PIC  is  ultimately  responsible  for  the  security  of  their  aircraft  when located  away  from  US  military  installations.    The  PIC  must  ensure  arrangements  are  made  to protect the aircraft during crew rest status at non-US protected locations. (T-1).   If US military security  forces  are  not  available,  the  planning  agency  must  consult  with  the  US  embassy assigned  to  that  country.  (T-1).      For  missions  involving  a  planning  agency,  the  agency  must coordinate  with  the  PIC  to  ensure  the  planned  security  measures  conform  to  mission requirements. (T-1).  The amount of security required varies, depending on location and ground time. 7.3.1.  For  non-permissive  or  uncertain  environments,  airfield  and  LZ  security  is  the responsibility of the agency requesting the airlift. Coordinate with the agency requesting the airlift to ensure security meets the requirement for the mission. 7.3.2.  For  permissive  environments,  the  PIC  will  receive  a  threat  assessment  and  force protection  capability  evaluation  briefing  at  home  station  prior  to  departure  and  receive updates  enroute,  if  required.  (T-2).  When  landing  at  a  DoD  component  installation,  the installation commander is responsible to provide adequate security for the aircraft. The PIC will determine if security  is  adequate.  (T-2).   Planning  agencies  and PIC should use  Table 7.1  to  help  assess  the  risk  to  parked  aircraft  for  planned  overnight  stops  located  at  non-US military installations overseas and civilian airfields. For unscheduled or emergency landings at  non-USAF  installations,  assess  the  aircraft  security  situation  and  take  the  following actions, if force protection capability appears insufficient:    NOTE:  Aircrews do posses the training to provide the appropriate security when present at the aircraft. 7.3.2.1.  Aircrew  Surveillance.    If  the  aircraft  is  not  remaining  overnight,  aircrew  are capable  of  maintaining  appropriate  aircraft  security.  The  PIC  will  direct  armed crewmembers to remain  with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in the aircraft vicinity. (T-2).  Obtain a means to report suspicious or hostile activity to security forces (e.g., land mobile radio, cellular phone, etc.) 7.3.2.2.  Area  Patrol.  Request  area  patrol  coverage  from  local  security  forces  to  include back-up  response  forces.    If  local  authorities  request  payment  for  this  service,  use  AF Form 15, USAF Invoice. 104 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 7.3.2.3.  Departure  without  Crew  Rest.    If  local  security  forces  are  unacceptable  or unavailable,  the  PIC  may  waive  FDP  restrictions  and  depart  as  soon  as  possible  for  a destination with adequate force protection. If unable to depart the location due to system malfunction,  the  aircrew  must  secure  the  aircraft  to  the  best  of  their  ability.  (T-2).  Aircrew  will  not  leave  the  aircraft  unattended.  (T-2).    Crew  rest  requirements  are subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.  The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft protection and crew rest until relief  is  available.  Coordinate  through  home  station  channels  or  the  nearest  DoD installation,  US  embassy,  local  military,  or  law  enforcement  agencies  as  appropriate  to acquire additional security. 7.3.3.  Tailored Security Measures.  Standard physical security measures may be impractical at  times  due  to  mission,  terrain,  climate,  sociopolitical  sensitivities,  or  other  factors.    For example,  some  countries  don't  allow  armed  security  personnel.    On  other  deployments,  the mission  may  rely  on  maintaining  a  low  profile  and  attracting  as  little  attention  as  possible.  At such locations, tailor security measures to meet unique requirements when necessary.  As a minimum,  lock aircraft entry points and hatches.   If it is  not  possible to lock the aircraft, secure  aircraft  entry  points  and  hatches  in  a  manner  to  indicate  unauthorized  entry  (i.e., taping hatch release handles or using seals.)  The PIC is  the final  authority  for determining tailored  security  measures.    Contact  with  US  Embassy  personnel  is  required  at  locations where security agreements are not in existence. 7.3.4.  Ground Security Teams.  Ground security teams may be needed to guard the aircraft for  planned  overnight  stops.    Teams  may  be  sized  as  appropriate  based  on  mission requirements and threat evaluation (two member’s minimum) and may be made up entirely, or  in  part,  by  members  from  other  services.    Teams  may  travel  in  Mission  Essential Personnel  (MEP)  status  and  are  responsible  to  the  PIC  at  all  times.    In  turn,  the  PIC  is responsible for their welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.)  The PIC will ensure security team members  receive  a  mission  briefing,  aircraft  egress  training,  and  passenger  briefings,  as appropriate. (T-2).  The squadron commander is the final approval authority for the need of ground security teams for their aircraft and authority may be delegated to no lower than the PIC. 7.3.4.1.  Ground security teams will comply with AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials  For  Military  Air  Shipments,  at  all  times  when  carrying  weapons,  ammo  and equipment onboard the aircraft. (T-2). 7.3.4.2.  Due  to  the  sensitivity  of  weapons  in  foreign  countries,  ground  security  teams will keep their weapons  inside the aircraft and out  of sight of  foreign nationals, even if the  FCG  allows  them  to  be  carried  outside  the  aircraft.  (T-2).    If  a  destination  requires weapons to be carried outside the aircraft, the controlling MAJCOM must approve such action prior to deployment. 7.3.5.  Unauthorized  Entry.  If,  in  the  PIC’s  judgment,  the  aircraft  needs  to  be  locked  and sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry, take the following actions: 7.3.5.1.  Use  the  aircraft  lock  and  available  aircraft  ground  security  locking  devices. NOTE:   The aircraft will be locked during all off-station missions remaining overnight. (T-2). AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 105 7.3.5.2.  Secure  the  doors  in  a  manner  that  can  indicate  unauthorized  entry  (e.g.,  tape inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose). 7.3.5.3.  Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal.) 7.3.5.4.  Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of forced entry. 7.3.5.5.  Report  any  unauthorized  entry  or  tampering  to  the  Office  of  Special Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency.  Thoroughly inspect aircraft prior to flight. 7.3.5.6.  Close  and  seal  the  main  crew  entrance  door  or  left  troop  door  using  a  metal boxcar  seal  or  other  controllable  device  to  identify  forced  entry.    Wipe  the  immediate area around the seal clean to help investigate forced entry. 7.3.5.7.  Coordinate  with  the  local  base  operations  representative  on  procedures  for servicing the aircraft while the crew is away.  If a padlock is used, the key or combination is left with base operations or the representative for servicing and maintenance personnel. 7.3.6.  Security  awareness is  crucial to  effective  mission accomplishment.   Aircrews should always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially in high threat, low security locations.  During  pre-flight  activities,  inspect  accessible  areas  not  normally  covered  by  normal  pre-flight  duties,  to  include  aircraft  wheel-wells,  air  conditioning  compartments,  crew/troop oxygen  service  panels,  and  cargo  compartment  for  unauthorized  packages,  personnel,  or other  unfamiliar  devices.    Report  any  suspicious  items  to  host  security  forces.    Aircrews maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities. 7.4.  Aircraft  Security  Risk  Assessment  Matrix.  In  coordination  with  planning  agencies  use this matrix to help assess the risk to parked aircraft in a permissive environment.  This matrix is used for planned overnight stops at non-US military installations overseas and civilian airfields.  A cumulative score of less than 55 implies that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are adequate.    A  score  of  55  to  90  implies  moderate  security  risk.    Commanders  may  consider additional  security  measures.    If  the  cumulative  score  is  greater  than  90,  commanders  should consider  deploying  or  contracting  security  personnel.    The  squadron  commander  or  deployed commander  is  the  final  approval  authority  for  aircraft  security  issues.    Authority  may  be delegated no lower than the PIC.   EXCEPTION:  During unscheduled or emergency landings, the  PIC  is  the  final  approval  authority  for  aircraft  security.    The  PIC  should  contact  the  US Embassy or United States Defense Attaché Office (USDAO)  for security assistance.    NOTE:  Normally,  additional  security  for  the  aircraft  is  not  required  at  military  installations  within  a NATO country or US civilian airfields approved by the FAA/TSA. Table 7.1.

Protective  Standards  For  Aircraft  Carrying  Distinguished  Visitors.  This  paragraph applies  specifically  to  aircraft  transporting  DVs  Code  4  or  above.    The  PIC  is  responsible  for aircraft security at enroute stops. 7.5.1.  DoD  Installations.    Notify  base  security  forces  of  estimated  arrival  and  departure times.    Request  security  forces  maintain  continuous  security  surveillance  during  the  entire ground time.  If the installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available. 7.5.2.  Non-DoD  Installations.    Contact  the  airport  manager  or  installation  commander  to arrange for force protection.  If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security using AF Form 15. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 107 7.6.  Arming  of  Crewmembers.  When crews are directed to carry weapons, at least one flight deck  crewmember,  and  one  LM  will  be  armed.  (T-2).    All  crewmembers  should  know  who  is armed.  The following procedures apply when arming is necessary: 7.6.1.  Weapons  Issue.  Before  departing  home  station,  authorized  crewmembers  obtain weapons,  ammunition,  box  (if  required),  lock,  and  key.  Crewmembers  will  be  armed according to AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, and MAJCOM publications. (T-2). Crewmembers must present a current AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to  Bear  Firearms.  (T-2).    Crewmembers  are  reissued  the  same  weapon  until  the  mission  terminates  at  home  station.  If  an  armed  crewmember  must  leave  the  crew  enroute,  transfer the  weapon  to  another  authorized  crewmember  using  AF  Form  1297,  Temporary  Issue Receipt. 7.6.2.  Loading  and  Transfer  of  Weapons.    Load  and  unload  weapons  at  approved  clearing barrels/facilities, if available.  To transfer a loaded weapon to another crewmember, place the weapon on a flat surface.  Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer. 7.6.3.  Wearing of Weapons for Anti-Hijacking.  Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the identity of armed crewmembers.  Do not wear weapons off the flight line, except  to  and  from  the  C2,  armories,  and  other  facilities  associated  with  aircrew  activities such  as  base  operations,  fleet  service,  cargo  or  passenger  terminals,  flight  line  cafeterias, snack bars, etc. 7.6.3.1.  Military  Passenger  Terminal  Procedures.  Armed  crewmembers  must  discreetly identify  themselves  to  military  passenger  service  personnel  upon  arrival  at  security checkpoints.  (T-2).  One  crewmember  will  present  a  valid  set  of  crew  orders,  military identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing the carrying of concealed weapons. (T-2).  Once terminal personnel verify this, they then authorize  the  crewmember  to  vouch  for  the  remaining  crewmembers.  The  entire  crew then  proceeds  through  the  magnetometer  without  removing  objects  from  their  pockets.  This prevents passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed. 7.6.4.  Weapons Storage  In-Flight.  Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight, on-load  or  off-load  duties  and  until  completion  of  all  post-flight  duties.  (T-2).    When  no passengers  are  aboard,  weapons  may  be  stored  in  the  gun  box  in-flight  after  a  satisfactory stowaway  check.    If  no  gun  box  is  available  retain  weapon  for  the  duration  of  the  flight.  Crewmembers  will  rearm  before  landing.  (T-2).    Weapons  should  not  be  unloaded  before placing them in a gun box. 7.6.5.  Weapons Storage on the Ground.  Aircraft gun box use is acceptable at military base locations providing the aircrew coordinates with base security forces so they can provide a 24 hour guard at the aircraft. 7.6.6.  When storing weapons in the gun box: 7.6.6.1.  Weapons should normally not be unloaded. 7.6.6.2.  Inform  C2/base  operations  which key/combination. crewmember  has the  gun  box 108 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 7.6.7.  Crew  Rest.    During  crew  rest,  store  weapons  in  the  most  secure  facility  available, normally  the  base  armory.    If  a  weapons  storage  facility  is  unavailable,  or  the  country prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box. 7.6.7.1.  Aircraft  without  a  Gun  Box.  If  an  aircraft  without  a  gun  box  must  remain overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the nearest  acceptable  facility.    Acceptable  storage  facilities  are  US  or  Allied  military services  armories,  US  National  Guard  and  Reserve  armories,  and  US  civil  law enforcement  armories.    If  none  of  these  are  available,  or  the  PIC  believes  weapons security may be compromised, crewmembers may secure their weapons in their quarters. One crewmember will remain with the weapons at all times. (T-2).  In this case, turn the ammunition over to the PIC. 7.6.8.  Due  to  the  dynamic  nature  of  contingency  and  combat  operations,  unit  commanders may designate all aircrew as arming group A for the purpose of aircraft/resource protection for the following weapons: M-9, M-4/M-16 or equivalent, and M-870, IAW AFI 31-117 and AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms Program. 7.7.  Standby/Alert  Aircraft  Security.  Ensure  aircraft  hatches  and  doors  are  secure  to  show unauthorized entry; seal the crew entrance door with a box car seal, or other controllable device, which prevents entry without damaging the door or lock. Notify the C2 agency that the aircraft is sealed  and  provide  them  a  means  to  access  the  aircraft  in  an  emergency.    Annotate  the  forms with  the  time  the  aircraft  was  sealed.  The  C2  Senior  Controller  may  grant  access  to  a  sealed aircraft;  document  time  of  entry  and  ensure  it  remains  launch  capable.  The  PIC  or  designated representative  must  be  present  if  access  to  the  aircraft  is  necessary  and  ensures  the  aircraft  is resealed.  (T-2).    The  aircrew  pre-flight  portion  remains  valid  if  performed  by  one  aircrew, sealed,  and flown by another aircrew.     NOTE:    WG/CCs should develop  local  procedures for documentation and management IAW TO 00-20-1 and MAJCOM Supplement. 7.8.  Enroute Security.  If required, a ground security team may be assigned to the mission. 7.8.1.  Entry  Control  Procedures.    Unescorted  entry  is  granted  to  aircrew  members  and support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air Force  Entry  Control  Card,  supported  by  an  Entry  Access  List  (EAL)  or  aircrew  orders.  Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority. 7.8.1.1.  Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL. 7.8.1.2.  Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area. (T-2). 7.9.  Preventing and Resisting Hijacking. 7.9.1.  The  Air  Transportation  Act  of  1974  and  the  Federal  Aviation  Act  of  1958,  as amended, vest the FAA Administrator with exclusive responsibility for the direction of law enforcement activity in aircraft hijacking situations involving all aircraft (civil and military) in-flight in the United States. 7.9.2.  In  taking  action  during  an  aircraft  hijacking  situation,  military  forces  will  act  under military command within the scope of their duties. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 109 7.9.3.  In  the  event  an  aircraft  involved  in  an  aircraft  hijacking  situation  is  carrying documents,  equipment,  or  material  that  DoD  has  determined  to  be  highly  sensitive,  or weapons  of  mass  destruction,  DoD  will  provide  FAA,  and  where  appropriate,  the  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information.  Where possible, the FAA will consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity. 7.9.4.  An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft is operationally ready for flight. 7.9.5.  A  concerted  effort  is  made  to  prevent  the  hijacking  of  military  or  military  contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft. 7.9.6.  Should  preventive  efforts  fail,  any  actual  attempt  to  hijack  a  military  aircraft  is resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation. 7.9.7.  Since  air  piracy  may  be  committed  by  political  terrorists  or  by  individuals  to  whom the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may be ineffective.  Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures. 7.9.8.  Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of life or property. 7.9.9.  Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft is rendered as requested by the PIC  of  the  aircraft  and  the  authority  exercising  operational  control  of  the  anti-hijacking effort. 7.10.  Preventive Measures.  Commanders at all levels ensure preventive measures are taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers.  Aircrews make every reasonable effort to resist  an  aircraft  hijacking  attempt,  resistance  may  vary  from  dissuasion,  to  direct  physical confrontation,  including  the  use  of  deadly  force.    Due  to  the  sensitive  nature  of  anti-hijacking procedures,  crewmembers  should  reference  AFI  13-207,  Preventing  and  Resisting  Aircraft Piracy  (Hijacking)  (FOUO),  MAJCOM  Sup.  to  AFI  13-207,  and  the  FIH  for  more  specific guidance.  Aircrews  will  not  release  any  information  concerning  those  procedures  or  hijacking attempts. (T-2).  Anti-hijacking is a crew duty performed exclusively by aircrew personnel.  The hijacking  of  an  USAF  aircraft  could  create  a  serious  international  incident  and  jeopardize  the safety of passengers and property.  An aircraft is most vulnerable when the crew is on board and the aircraft is ready for flight.  Hijackers cannot be dealt with as ordinary criminals.  Some are mentally  disturbed,  emotionally  unstable  individuals  for  whom  the  threat  of  death  is  not  a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime.  Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and property.  Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the problem.    Passenger  terminals  should  be  used  for  passenger  screening  to  the  maximum  extent possible. 7.10.1.  Acceptance  of  Passengers.    The  host  station  passenger  processing  or  manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections.  Do not board passengers until the PIC is fully  satisfied  with  inspection  results.  In  the  absence  of  qualified  passenger  service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage is  accomplished.  (T-2).      EXCEPTION:    Supporting/supported  forces  may  be  anti-hijack inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew. 110 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 7.10.1.1.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration  provides  the  latest  guidance  on passenger screening and carry-on allowances. 7.10.1.1.1.  Aircrew  must  ensure  thorough  screenings  are  accomplished  when processing passengers at locations without a military passenger terminal. (T-2). 7.10.1.1.2.  Carry-on  restrictions  apply  to  all  passengers  required  to  process  through the passenger terminal.  Carry-on restrictions do not apply to personnel not required to process through the passenger terminal.  This includes: 7.10.1.1.2.1.  Aircrew  members  listed  on  the  Flight  Authorization  for  that mission. 7.10.1.1.2.2.  MEPs for that mission. 7.10.1.1.3.  Consider  baggage  contained  in  areas  not  readily  accessible  in-flight  as checked baggage, even if carried to the aircraft by the passengers.  This includes, but is  not  limited to  segregated baggage compartments,  floor loaded baggage tied down with cargo straps/chains, palletized baggage, and baggage in baggage bins. 7.10.1.1.4.  The  aircrew  will  brief  passengers,  required  to  process  through  the passenger terminal, or equivalent, that baggage in these areas can not be accessed in-flight.  (T-2).    If  these  passengers  attempt  to  access  checked  baggage  in-flight,  all attempts  should  be  made  to  stop  the  passengers  from  accessing  the  baggage.    Land the  aircraft  at  the  nearest  suitable  airport  (preferably  a  military  facility)  with appropriate  law  enforcement  personnel.    If  needed,  request  assistance  removing  the passenger(s) and any accompanying baggage from the aircraft.  Comply with all law enforcement direction. 7.10.2.  Medical  facility  commanders  are  responsible  for  anti-hijacking  inspection  of patients.    When  patients  are  delivered  to  the  aircraft  by  civilian  sources,  the  aircrew  will perform required inspections prior to loading. (T-2). 7.10.2.1.  For aeromedical evacuation (AE) missions, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) is  the  final  authority  for  determining  what  medical  items  can  be  carried  by/for  AE patients. 7.10.3.  During  exercises  or  contingencies  in  support  of  combat  operations  involving  the movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers and perform anti-hijacking inspections. 7.10.4.  Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried baggage  aboard  an  aircraft.  (T-2).      EXECPTION:    Special  agents,  guards  of  the  Secret Service  or  State  Department,  designated  security  team  members,  and  other  individuals specifically authorized to carry weapons with coordination of the PIC. In all cases the crew will be aware of location of weapons and ammunition. (T-2). 7.10.4.1.  Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an aircraft.  (T-2).    They  will  turn  it  in  to  the  troop  commander  or  PIC.  (T-2).   EXCEPTION:    During  combat  operations,  troops  may  carry  unloaded  weapons  and ammunition on board the aircraft.  When the tactical situation dictates, personnel who are prepared  to  engage  an  enemy  force  immediately  upon  deplaning  at  the  objective  may carry loaded weapons aboard the aircraft at the discretion of the troop commander/team AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 111 leader, with the PIC’s concurrence. Personnel will not breach weapons until clear of the aircraft. (T-2). 7.10.4.2.  Dummy  clips  that  can  be  easily  identified  may  be  loaded  for  training  at  the order of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew. 7.10.4.3.  Designated  security  teams  will  only  be  armed  in-flight  on  specifically designated missions identified on the mission “frag”  as “in-flight arming  required.”  (T-2). 7.10.5.  If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to: 7.10.5.1.  Move  to  a  safe,  clear  area  at  least  50  ft  from  any  aircraft,  equipment,  or personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons. 7.10.5.2.  Clear  weapons  in  accordance  with  standard  safety  procedures.    Ensure troop/aircraft commander retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.10.4.1. 7.11.  Initial Response.  When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft within  the  United  States,  response  is  according  to  the  following  guidelines  until  such  time  as FAA  assumes  active direction of  anti-hijacking  efforts.   Resist  all attempts  to  hijack a military aircraft.    Resistance  may  vary  from  simple  dissuasion,  through  deception  and  subterfuge,  to direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons. 7.11.1.  The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened, while the aircraft is on the ground: 7.11.1.1.  Delay  movement  of  the  aircraft  to  provide  time  for  ground  personnel  and  the aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions. 7.11.1.2.  The authority for determining when ground resistance is discontinued is vested in  the  highest  available  level  of  command.    When  adequate  communication  cannot  be established,  or  when  time  does  not  permit,  this  authority  is  delegated  in  the  following order: 7.11.1.2.1.  MAJCOM commander exercising control of the aircraft. 7.11.1.2.2.  MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies. 7.11.1.2.3.  Senior operational commander on scene. 7.11.1.2.4.  PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives. 7.11.2.  The  PIC  will  not  takeoff  if  the  hijacked  aircraft  is  carrying  weapons  of  mass destruction. (T-0) Refer to DoD 5210.41M, for additional guidance. 7.12.  In-Flight  Resistance.  In  the  event  of  a  hijacking,  crewmembers  should  act  immediately and  resourcefully,  without  instruction,  in  order  to  counter  the  attacker  successfully.    Many variables  of  a  hijacking  preclude  use  of  any  specific  counter-hijacking  procedure.    Some  key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker,  and  the  presence  of  sensitive  material  onboard.    Some  counter-hijacking  actions  the aircrew may consider are: 112 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 7.12.1.  Engage  the  hijacker(s)  in  conversation  in  an  attempt  to  calm  them  and  to  evaluate what course of action might be effective. 7.12.2.  Dissuade the hijacker. 7.12.3.  Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary. 7.12.4.  Propose  more  favorable  alternatives,  such  as  landing  in  a  neutral,  rather  than  a hostile, country. 7.12.5.  Exploit  any  reasonable  opportunity  to  incapacitate  or  overcome  the  hijacker physically, including the prudent use of firearms. 7.12.6.  In  any  suspected  or  actual  hijack  attempt,  the  aircrew  basic  objective  is  to  get  the aircraft  on  the  ground  as  quickly  as  possible  and  keep  it  there.    If  the  pilot  needs  to  land quickly, the pilot requests an emergency descent clearance from ATC. 7.13.  Communications  Between  Aircrew  and  Ground  Agencies.  Crews  facing  a  hijacking threat should transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC.  Notify ground agencies as soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as circumstances permit.  Covert signals are no longer used per FAA guidance. 7.14.  Forced  Penetration  of  Unfriendly  Airspace.  Refer  to  FIH  for  international  signals  for air intercept. 7.15.  Air Force Installation Security Program.  The following security procedures implement AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), requirements for C-130 aircraft: 7.15.1.  The aircraft is parked in  an established restricted area and afforded protection via a roving  patrol,  a  two-person  Internal  Security  Response  Team  (ISRT),  with  immediate response  not  to  exceed  3  minutes,  and  a  two-person  External  Security  Response  Team (ESRT), with response capability within 5 minutes. 7.15.2.  When  no  permanent  or  established  restricted  area  parking  space  is  available, establish  a  temporary  restricted  area  consisting  of  a  raised  rope  barrier,  and  post  with restricted area signs.  Provide a one-person mobile patrol, supported by  a two-person  ISRT capable  of  a  5  minute  response.    Portable  security  lighting  is  provided  during  the  hours  of darkness if sufficient permanent lighting is not available. 7.15.3.  At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter.  If he or she determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft departs to a station where adequate security is available. 7.15.4.  The security force is made aware of all visits to the aircraft.  The security force POC is identified to the PIC. 7.15.5.  Security  support  is  a  continual  requirement  and  is  not  negated  by  the  presence  of aircrew  or  ground  crewmembers.    Security  force  support  terminates  only  after  the  aircraft doors are closed and the aircraft taxis. 7.15.6.  Locking and Sealing.  Lock and seal the aircraft during a “remain over night” (RON) on non-secure ramps (see paragraph 7.3.5.)   NOTE:  The aircraft is locked during all off-station missions remaining overnight. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 113 7.16.  Force  Protection.  Crews need to be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.  Reference AFTTP 3-4, Airman’s Manual, Joint Service Guide 5260, Service Member's Personal Protection  Guide:  Combat  Terrorism  While  Overseas,  and  AFI  10-245,  Antiterrorism  (AT)  for Force Protection measures. 114 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 Chapter 8 OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS 8.1.  General.  This  chapter  contains  a  description  of  applicable  reports  and  forms.    For assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, unit, or local flight safety officer. 8.2.  AF Form 457,  USAF Hazard Report.  Refer to AFI 91-202, The USAF Mishap Prevention Program.  The USAF hazard reporting system provides a means for Air Force personnel to alert supervisors  and  commanders  to  hazardous  conditions  requiring  prompt  corrective  action.

Practice  emergencies  (which  require  simulating  an  engine  shutdown,  placing switches  in  other  than  their  normal  position,  or  an  abnormal  configuration)  only  during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is in one of  the  pilot  seats.    Instructor  pilot  candidates  who  occupy  a  pilot  seat  and  are  under  the supervision of a flight examiner pilot, not in a pilot seat, may conduct simulated emergency procedures  during  initial  or  requalification  upgrade  evaluations.    Preface  all  simulated emergencies  with  the  word  "simulated"  and  terminate  simulated  emergencies  if  an  actual emergency arises. Engine and Failure 9.17.  Simulated 3-Engine  Approaches/Landings/Missed Approaches.  Pilots  must  have  direct  IP  supervision  except  for  IP  candidates  under  the supervision of a flight examiner during initial or requalification upgrade evaluations to IP. (T-2).  One  power  lever  may  be  retarded  to  FLIGHT  IDLE  at  not  less  than  VMCA  (one-engine inoperative, out of ground effect) not less than 300 ft AGL. 124 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 9.17.1.  Turns into the simulated inoperative engine(s) should be minimized.  Such turns are permissible but require a higher degree of pilot skill than with actual failed engines and need to be smooth and coordinated.  WARNING:  Improper rudder or power application can lead to an immediate out-of-control condition where recovery may not be possible. 9.17.2.  Weather.  Simulated engine failure is authorized in day IMC conditions if weather is at or above circling minimums and at night with weather at or above 1,000 ft ceiling and 2 SM visibility, or circling minimums, whichever is higher. Pilots will only perform simulated engine failures if the crosswind  component is  within  the recommended zone of the landing crosswind chart. (T-2). 9.17.3.  Pilots must comply with the following additional restrictions: (T-2). 9.17.3.1.  Use all 4 engines for a touch-and-go takeoff. 9.17.3.2.  Simulated  engine-out  no-flap  landings  are  restricted  to  AC  candidates  and above. 9.17.3.3.  Planned  go-arounds  from  simulated  engine-out  no-flap  approaches  are  not authorized. 9.17.3.4.  Required  go-arounds  from  simulated  engine  out  no-flap  approaches  require setting the flaps to 50% and using all four engines. 9.17.3.5.  Do  not  compound  engine  out  circling  approaches  with  any  other  simulated malfunctions. 9.17.3.6.  Missed  approach/go-arounds  are  executed  IAW  paragraph  9.9  of  this instruction. 9.18.  Simulated  Engine-Out  Takeoff.  Pilots  must  have  direct  IP  supervision  and  authorized during  daylight  VMC  only.  (T-2).  Maximum  aircraft  gross  weight  is  limited  to  120,000  lbs.  Pilots  will  only  perform  simulated  engine  out  if  the  crosswind  component  is  within  the recommended zone of the takeoff crosswind chart. Pilots will only perform this when the runway is dry, hard surfaced, and at least 147 ft wide, by 7,000 ft long. (T-2). 9.19.  Actual  Engine  Shutdown  and  Airstart.  Pilots  must  have  direct  IP  supervision.  (T-2). One engine may by shutdown at no lower than 2,500 ft AGL in daylight VMC when necessary for maintenance actions such as Functional Check Flights (FCF). 9.20.  No-Flap  Approach/Landing.  Pilots  must  have  direct  IP  supervision.  (T-2).  Maximum aircraft gross weight limited to 120,000 lbs. Pilots will only perform no-flap approach/landing if the  crosswind  component  is  within  the  recommended  zone  on  the  crosswind  chart.  (T-2). Authorized  in  daylight  IMC  if  the  weather  is  at  or  above  circling  minimums  and  at  night  with weather  at  or  above  1,000  ft  ceiling  and  2  SM  visibility,  or  circling  minimums,  whichever  is higher.    Use  50%  flaps  for  a  go-around  and  touch-and-go  takeoff.    NOTE:    Check  no-flap landing distance with runway available and be aware of landing gear speed limitations. 9.20.1.  Do not compound no-flap circling approaches with any other simulated malfunction. 9.21.  Practice  Emergency  Climb  Procedure.  Authorized  in  day/night  VMC.    Minimum airspeed  should  not  be  less  than  10  knots  above  the  stall  speed  caret.    An  instructor  or  flight examiner is not required for accomplishment of this event. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 125 9.22.  Receiver  Air-to-Air  Refueling  Training.  Do  not  use  the  aux  hydraulic  system  and/or override signal amplifier during training missions. 9.23.  Formal  Course  Maneuvers  Only.  The  following  maneuvers  are  normally  conducted during formal course upgrade/qualification training only. 9.23.1.  Aborted  Normal  Takeoff.    Pilots  must  have  OG/CC  approval,  direct  IP  supervision and authorized during formal upgrade training in daylight VMC only. (T-2). Pilots will only perform this when the runway is dry, hard-surfaced, and equal to or greater than CFL. (T-2).  Pilots  will  only  perform  aborted  normal  takeoffs  if  the  crosswind  component  is  within  the recommended  zone  of  the  takeoff  crosswind  chart.  (T-2).    Initiate  the  abort  by  stating “REJECT”  before  refusal  speed.    Do  not  practice  aborts  from  touch-and-go  or  stop-and-go landings.  Do not shut down an engine due to simulated malfunctions. 9.23.2.  Aborted  Maximum  Effort  Takeoff.    Pilots  must  have  OG/CC  approval,  direct  IP supervision  and authorized for AC upgrades and above during formal  upgrade training.  (T-2). Procedure is restricted to the main runway during daylight VMC. Pilots will only perform this when the runway is dry, hard-surfaced, and equal to or greater than CFL. (T-2).   Pilots will  only  perform  aborted  normal  takeoffs  if  the  crosswind  component  is  within  the recommended zone of the takeoff crosswind chart. (T-2).  Simulate a runway length less than CFL.  Initiate the abort by stating “REJECT” at or below a refusal speed based on simulated runway  length.    Compare  the  distance  traveled  to  runway  length  and  point  out  the ramifications  of  operating  with  less  than  CFL.    Subsequent  aborted  takeoffs  can  lead  to excessive brake heating.  If greater than a flight manual defined “partially braked landing” is used to stop, comply with all zone requirements and minimum brake cooling times IAW the performance  manual  LANDING  BRAKE  ENERGY  chart  between  aborted  takeoffs.  Pilots will not shut down an engine due to simulated malfunctions. (T-2).  Do not practice aborted max effort takeoffs from stop-and-go landings. 9.24.  Degraded  Systems  Training  (DST).  DST  is  used  to  prepare  crews  to  accomplish missions  simulating  certain  pieces  of  equipment  inoperative  (or  intentionally  turned  off  for emission control.)  On non-local  routes, designate leg segments during the route briefing.   The following restrictions and procedures are designed to maximize training and safety. 9.24.1.  Restrictions: 9.24.1.1.  Visibility must be 5 SM minimum. 9.24.1.2.  One radar altimeter must be operational and on. 9.24.1.3.  The LPCR must be operational. 9.24.1.4.  A mission instructor must be in either the pilot or CSO position. 9.24.1.5.  One HDD at any crew position must be selected and monitored by an instructor (P/CSO) for DST of the navigation system. 9.24.2.  PICs will brief the following items: 9.24.2.1.  Equipment simulated inoperative. 9.24.2.2.  Aircrew coordination. 9.24.2.3.  Disorientation and emergency procedures. 126 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 9.25.  Expendables/ECM  Training.  Conduct  all  expendables  training  IAW  AFI  11-214,  AFI 10-706,  Electronic  Warfare  (EW)  Operations,  and  host  nation  directives.    Dispense  only  when approved by the controlling agency  IAW agency procedures and restrictions.  When over open water,  do  not  drop  expendables  below  500  ft  AGL  or  within  3  NM  of  any  surface  vessel, platform, or landmass. Table 9.1.  Training Restrictions Summary.

General.  Units will publish local and/or unique unit operation procedures as a supplement to this chapter commencing with paragraph 10.2. (T-2).  The title indicates the unit concerned (e.g., 10.2. 71 RQS Local Operating Procedures). 10.1.1.  Procedures in this chapter can not duplicate, alter, amend, or be less restrictive than those in this instruction. 130 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 Chapter 11 NAVIGATION PROCEDURES 11.1.  General. 11.1.1.  Definitions and Terminology. 11.1.1.1.  Category I (CAT I) Route.  Any route that does not meet the requirements of a CAT II route, including tactical navigation and overwater routes. 11.1.1.2.  Category  II  (CAT  II)  Route.    Any  route  on  which  the  position  of  the  aircraft can  be  accurately  determined  by  the  overhead  crossing  of  a  radio  aid  (NDB,  VOR)  or intersection  of  at  least  two  radio  aid  radials  (VOR,  TACAN)  or  one  radial  (VOR, TACAN) and one DME at least once each hour. 11.1.1.3.  Controlling  Navigation  Solution.    The  controlling  EGI  (INAV)  navigation solution the mission computer is using for enroute navigation.  The SHIP SOLN, selected via  the  NAV  SELECT  page  of  the  AMU,  determines  which  will  be  used  to  steer  the aircraft either manually or with the autopilot. 11.1.1.4.  First  Suitable Airfield (FSAF) and  Last  Suitable Airfield (LSAF).  Utilized in the equal time point (ETP) calculation.  These are represented as the “First Nearest” and the “Last Nearest” airports in the ETP calculation in the PROGRESS pages of the CNI-MU.    They  are  airports  closest  to  the  coast  out  and  coast  in  waypoints  that  meet applicable  criteria  for  HC-130J  operations.    Forecast  weather  for  the  FSAF  and  LSAF must meet destination weather minimum filing requirements. 11.1.1.5.  Equal  Time  Point  (ETP).    Geographic  point  along  the  route  from  which  the flight time to the FSAF or the LSAF is equal. 11.1.1.6.  Required Navigation Performance (RNP).  RNP accuracy standards require an aircraft  to  remain  within  a  specific  number  of  nautical  miles  of  its  cleared  course centerline for 95% of the duration of the flight.  The associated track containment limit is twice the RNP value and represents the maximum limit of protected airspace.  Airspace where RNP is applied is considered special qualification airspace.  Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas.  RNP airspace is being  incorporated  around  the  world  to  increase  air  traffic  capacity  by  decreasing separation requirements between routes.  Refer to FLIP Area Planning publications/charts to determine RNP airspace. 11.1.1.7.  Minimum  Navigation  Performance  Specifications  (MNPS)  Airspace.    MNPS airspace exists in both the North Atlantic Region (NAT) and certain Canadian portions of the  North  American  Region.    Refer  to  FLIP  Area  Planning  publications/charts  to determine  MNPS  airspace.    The  HC-130J  must  comply  with  all  MNPS  equipment requirements when flying within the lateral dimensions of this airspace (consult FLIP for mandatory  equipment).    Aircraft  meeting  the  North  Atlantic  MNPS  requirements  also meet the Canadian MNPS requirements.  Aircraft entering MNPS airspace are required to have two Long Range Navigation Systems (LRNS) capable of staying within 12.6 NM of cleared track for 95 percent of the flight.  Gross navigation errors are those that exceed 24 NM  from  track  center  line.    Prior  to  entering  MNPS  airspace,  both  INSs  must  be  fully AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 131 operational  to  meet  the  MNPS  requirement  of  having  two  fully  serviceable  LRNSs.    In order to signify that a flight is approved to operate in NAT MNPS airspace, the letter “X” will be inserted within item 10 of the DD1801 flight plan form. 11.1.1.8.  NAT  Tracks.    Contained  within  the  North  Atlantic  MNPS  airspace  is  an organized track system (NAT Tracks) between FL 285 and FL 420 to optimize air traffic flow  between  the  North  American  and  European  continents.    NAT  tracks  are  designed based on meteorological data and are updated twice daily.  When flying over the North Atlantic, crews should obtain a copy of the North Atlantic Tracks (NAT tracks) valid for their coast out time from the DoD NOTAM internet site. 11.1.1.9.  Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  Airspace.    This  airspace requires special certification and exists to increase airspace capacity, safely, by reducing vertical  separation  from  2000  ft  to  1000  ft  between  suitably  equipped  aircraft.    RVSM has been implemented in the CONUS, Europe, Africa, and Middle East.  RVSM airspace typically extends from FL 290 through FL 410.  Consult AP/1 and AP/2 for locations and lateral and vertical dimensions of this airspace. 11.1.1.10.  Mission Planning Environment (MPE). A MAJCOM-certified combination of mission  planning  hardware  and  software  used  to  load  an  aircraft  data  transfer  device. Only an ACC-approved MPE may be used to load HC-130J map cards and mission cards (RMMs) for use in flight. 11.2.  High-Level Mission Planning Procedures. 11.2.1.  Refer to Chapter 6 for general mission planning requirements. 11.2.2.  Mission/Route  Planning.    Pilots/CSO  normally  accomplish  and  verify  mission planning while in a flight planning facility/base operations; the data is then loaded manually (or  via  the  data  transfer  card)  into  the  CNI.    Pilots/CSO  will  also  calculate  and  verify  the required ramp fuel load. (T-2). 11.2.2.1.  When practical, pilots/CSO plan the most direct routing possible or utilize wind optimized CFP routing to enhance fuel conservation. 11.2.2.2.  Computer  Flight  Plan  (CFP).    A  CFP  generated  from  PFPS  is  the  preferred flight  plan for all HC-130J operations.  Wind may  either be applied automatically via a MAJCOM  approved  source  or  manually  from  a  DD  175-1,  or  AF  product.When  paper wind products are used for flight planning, flight crew must carry them in-flight and file the completed master log and  chart for 3 months.  (T-2).  When planning CAT  I sorties crews should obtain wind data for multiple suitable altitudes including 10,000 ft MSL. 11.2.2.3.  Pilots/CSOs  must  verify  the  CFP  for  route  definition  and  accuracy,  paying particular attention to adherence with over flight clearances. (T-2). 11.2.2.4.  Refer to Chapter 12 for fuel planning procedures. 11.2.3.  Equal Time Point (ETP) Computations. 11.2.3.1.  The ETP provides crews a tool for recovery airfield decision-making when in-flight emergencies occur. Flight crews must complete ETP computations on CAT I routes when the total time between the LSAF and FSAF is 5 hours or more. (T-2).  Flight crews must annotate and plot ETPs on the MPC and MFP prior to the coast-out waypoint.  (T-132 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 2).  Squadron-approved computer programs which use similar algorithms as the manual computation  may  be  used.    The  PFPS  Fuel  Analysis  Tool  (FAT)  is  approved  for computing  ETPs.    Enter  ETP  information  into  the  CNI  PROGRESS  page  during preflight.  CNI-computed ETPs only become accurate upon reaching the PERF CRUISE altitude.  CNI-computed ETPs can be obtained for different airspeeds (i.e. 260 KTAS for a  3-engine  scenario).    CNI-computed  ETP  do  not  calculate  if  you  do  not  overfly  the programmed  coast-out  point.  NOTE:    ETP  computations  are  not  required  for  maritime search procedures. 11.2.3.2.  The blocks provided on top of the C130J PFPS CFP should be used to record information needed by the CNI to compute an ETP.  These blocks and provided formulas also  serve  as  a  worksheet  for  crews  to  do  the  manual  ETP  computation.    If  using  the computer programs or the CNI, annotate applicable information on the Master Flight Plan (MFP).  If the CNI is used, annotate “CNI” in the master flight plan blocks for which the CNI does not present a number. 11.2.3.3.  In-flight ETP.  Use the PFPS FAT or manually re-compute the ETP via one of the four ETP options from Figure 11.1 when the actual arrival over any reporting point prior to the ETP (as displayed on the printed and winded flight plan) exceeds 15 minutes ahead or behind time when the change was caused by erroneous wind information. Figure 11.1.  ETP Calculations. 11.2.3.4.  Follow the below procedures to compute a manual ETP: 11.2.3.4.1.  Identify  and  record  the  LSAF,  coast-out  point,  approximate  midpoint  of the  CAT  I  portion,  coast-in  point,  and  FSAF.    The  coast-out  point,  approximate  AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 133 midpoint,  and  coast-in  point  are  actual  waypoints  on  the  flight  plan.    The  coast-out point for ETP purposes occurs after initial level-off. 11.2.3.4.2.  Determine and record the distance from the LSAF to the FSAF (entering the two airfields and approximate midpoint into PFPS is an easy way to do this). 11.2.3.4.3.  Determine  and  record  the  average  groundspeed  (GS)  for  the  first-half (coast-out to midpoint) and second-half (midpoint to coast-in) of the CAT I portion.  Divide  the  respective  enroute  distance  by  the  enroute  time  to/from  the  midpoint  to determine accurate average GS. 11.2.3.4.4.  Calculate  a  wind  factor  (WF1  &  WF2)  for  each  half  by  subtracting  the flight-planned average TAS  from  the averaged GS.   If  a tailwind  is  experienced the WF is positive.  If a headwind is experienced the WF is negative. 11.2.3.4.5.  Use  the  provided  formulas  to  compute  the  time  it  takes  to  fly  from  the ETP  to  the  FSAF.    Use  this  time  and  the  second-half-averaged  GS  to  calculate  a distance from the FSAF that the ETP occurs. Figure 11.2.  Formulas to compute the time it takes to fly from the ETP to the FSAF.  11.2.3.4.6.  The  INDEX  FROM/TO  and  PROGRESS  pages  may  also  be  utilized in-flight  to  update  times  and  distances  to  diversion  bases  along  the  route  of  flight.  An accurate GS needs to be entered in order to obtain correct ETE calculations. 11.2.3.4.7.  Due to  the requirement for ETPs to  be highly  accurate in  the  case of  an emergency,  it  is  always  advisable  for  aircrew  to  double-check  both  computer  and manual calculations.  Failure to follow this guidance could result in the inability of an aircraft to make landfall prior to fuel exhaustion. 11.3.  Master Flight Plan and Master Plotting Chart. 11.3.1.  The flight  crew must use one CFP and one plotting chart as master copies for each flight  utilizing  CAT  I  procedures.  (T-2).    Both  are  labeled  “MASTER  COPY”  and  are referred to as Master Flight Plan (MFP) and Master Plotting Chart (MPC). Both documents must be retained by the unit current operations or designated representative for a period of 3 months following the mission. (T-2). 11.3.2.  MFP Usage.  The MFP is normally maintained by the PM or CSO but should be kept readily available to all crew members. Use the MFP to record the following in flight: 11.3.2.1.  All ATC route clearances and changes to clearances. 134 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 11.3.2.2.  The  wind,  temperature,  altitude,  fuels  remaining,  and  the  bearing/range between  the  INAV  solutions  over  waypoints  bordering  and  within  CAT  I  Navigation airspace. 11.3.2.3.  Any loss or degraded navigation/avionics equipment. 11.3.2.4.  Compass deviation checks. 11.3.2.5.  Oceanic Navigation Accuracy Check. 11.3.3.  MFP Symbology. Use the following symbology to ensure that both pilots can easily determine  which  waypoints  have  been  programmed  into  the  CNI-MU,  which  programmed waypoints  have  been  verified,  and  which  waypoints  have  been  transitioned  in-flight.    See Figure 12.2 for an example MFP. 11.3.3.1.  Place  a  check-mark  next  to  the  waypoint  to  signify  the  waypoint  has  been entered into the CNI-MU and the course and distance have been verified. 11.3.3.2.  Circle  the  check-mark  to  signify  the  coordinates,  course  and  distance  in  the CNI-MU have been verified by another crewmember. 11.3.3.3.  Draw one diagonal line through the circled check-mark to signify the waypoint has  been  passed,  reported,  and  all  applicable  annotations  associated  with  waypoint passage have been completed. 11.3.3.4.  Cross the first  diagonal  line with  another to  signify that the aircraft‘s position has  been  plotted  on  the  MPC  approximately  60  NM  (10  to  15  minutes  depending  on groundspeed) after waypoint passage. 11.3.4.  MPC Usage. The flight crew must use a plotting chart on every route requiring CAT I Navigation. (T-2).   Use an appropriate JNC-A, JNC, GNC, or an Oceanic Planning Chart (OPC).  During mission planning,  draw/print the course line representing  the planned route of  flight  on  the  MPC  and  mark  the  associated  suitable  emergency  airfields.  The  PIC  will verify  this  information  and  annotate  the  chart  with  his/her  signature,  date,  and  mission number/call sign.  (T-2).   During flight, 10 to 15 minutes (depending on groundspeed) after each CAT I waypoint, Mark Position and then plot the INS-only position on the MPC (using a  dot  surrounded  by  a  square)  and  annotate  the  marked  time  and  position  coordinates adjacent to the plot.  The CSO/PM should compare the plotted point to the course line.  This procedure  confirms  that  the  navigation  system  is  steering  the  airplane  to  the  correct waypoint. 11.4.  Pre-Flight Procedures. 11.4.1.  The  flight  crew  must  include  in  the  pre-flight  procedures  a  ZULU  time  check  and resynchronization  of  the  aircraft  master  clock,  if  necessary.  (T-2).    The  flight  crew  will always set the aircraft master clock to ZULU time.  (T-2).  The flight crew will annotate all times in ZULU format.  Aircraft clock errors resulting in position report time errors can lead to  an  erosion  of  actual  longitudinal  separation  between  aircraft.    Acceptable  time  standards that can be used include GPS, Naval Observatory Master Clock (DSN 312-762-1401/1069 or 312-560-6742), and WWV (2500, 5000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 kHz) via wristwatch or other device. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 135 11.4.2.  Pre-Flight  Communications  Check.    A  pre-flight  check  of  the  SATCOM  and  HF radios should be made to a suitable agency (operating authority, command post or ATC). The PIC must terminate the mission unless at least one HF radio must be confirmed operational prior to coast out. (T-2). 11.4.3.  Navigation  Initialization  and  Solutions.    Both  the  AUTONAV  and  manual  GC alignment of the INSs result in the required navigation performance needed for RNP RNAV operation.  The GPS positions may be used as initial positions as long as they agree within one-tenth of one minute.  If GPS is not available, use precision parking coordinates or, as a last resort, obtain coordinates from an airfield diagram published in an approved instrument approach  book.  This  position  must  be  checked  and  verified  by  both  pilots  and  recorded  on the MFP. (T-2). 11.4.4.  Communication/Navigation/Identification  Management  System In addition to Chapter 6 requirements, when configuring for CAT I operations, both pilots or pilot  and  CSO  will  verify  that  the  INAV  Position  Alert  1  is  set  to  4.0  miles  and  INAV Position Alert 2 is set to 8.0 miles on the CNI PROGRESS page.  (T-2).   This generates an INAV  POS  DIFFERENCE  Advisory  at  4.0  miles  and  an  INAV  POS  MISCOMPARE Caution at 8.0 miles. (CNI-MS). 11.4.5.  Loading the Route of Flight.  Because CAT I routes usually involve the manual input of waypoints not found in the database, and often require aircraft maximum range capability, it is critical that both pilots and CSO work in sequence and independently to  enter accurate route  of  flight  data.    It  is  not  sufficient  for  one  crewmember  to  simply  observe  another crewmember entering the data. 11.4.5.1.  The following steps are completed by the pilots/CSO: 11.4.5.1.1.  Load  the  route  of  flight  directly  from  the  filed  flight  plan,  MFP  or  data transfer card into the CNI and verify both the magnetic course and the leg distance for each  waypoint  with  the  MFP.    Loading  the  route  directly  from  the  filed  flight  plan may  minimize  pilot/controller  clearance  loop  (misinterpretation)  errors.    Label waypoints  so  they  can  be  readily  identified  for  subsequent  position  reporting.  If  the courses differ by more than 2° or the distances  differ by more than 2 NM, the pilot will resolve the discrepancy prior to flight. (T-2). Completion of this step is annotated with a check-mark next to the waypoint. 11.4.5.1.2.  Using  the  LEGS  pages,  insert  the  forecast  winds  (if  available)  at  each waypoint. 11.4.5.1.3.  Verify the total distance to the destination on the CNI PROGRESS page. Any  significant  disparity  (more  than  25  NM  to  allow  for  SIDs/STARs  and approaches)  in  the  total  distance  between  the  CNI  and  MFP  will  require  the  flight crew to recheck the ramp position and waypoint coordinates. (T-2). 11.4.5.2.  Both pilots (or pilot and CSO) will verify the waypoint coordinates and course and distance information from  the opposite side  CNI to  the MFP.  (T-2).  Completion of this step is annotated with the check-mark being circled on the MFP. 136 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 11.4.5.3.  If  the  planned  route  of  flight  is  a  stored  route  or  one  loaded  during  a  data transfer,  verification  of  waypoint  coordinates  must  still  be  accomplished  by  both  pilots (or pilot and CSO) in the same manner. (T-2). 11.5.  CAT I Navigation Procedures.  Complete and/or comply with the following procedures: 11.5.1.  This  section  provides  general  procedures  and  guidance  for  the  operation  of navigation  systems  on  CAT  I  routes.    For  navigation  system  requirements,  consider  all oceanic  airspace  as  MNPS  airspace.    Specific  procedures  for  RNP  RNAV  airspace  are addressed in subsequent sections. 11.5.2.  Ensure aircraft is RVSM compliant. 11.5.3.  Navigation System Accuracy Checks. 11.5.3.1.  Ground.  After leaving the ramp, perform the INS/INAV groundspeed check by stopping  the  aircraft  and  checking  each  pilot‘s  groundspeed  on  the  CNI-MUs  or HDDs/HUDs.    Groundspeeds  in  excess  of  1  knot  while  the  aircraft  is  stationary  may indicate a faulty INS. 11.5.3.2.  Airborne.    Determine  INAV  position  accuracy  by  comparing  it  to  enroute NAVAIDs. 11.5.3.3.  Compass  Deviation  Check.    Perform  a  compass  deviation  check  using  both INSs  and  the  standby  compass  prior  to  entering  CAT  I  airspace.    Perform  subsequent checks after heading changes of 30° (or greater) or every 3 hours.  Record the deviation in  the  appropriate  block  of  the  MFP.    Apply  this  correction  to  headings  to  be  flown whenever it is necessary to use the standby compass as the sole source for navigation. 11.5.3.4.  Oceanic Navigation Accuracy Check.  Prior to coast-out, evaluate/compare the accuracy of all navigation solutions.  In the event of discrepancies, greater than 4 NM, the crew should investigate the cause and determine if CAT I flight is feasible.  Record this gross  error  check  in  the  appropriate  block  of  the  MFP.    If  a  pure  INS  position  is determined  to  be  more  than  4  miles  in  error,  an  in-flight  alignment  (IFA)  may  be accomplished  provided  sufficient  time  is  available  prior  to  entering  RNP  RNAV  or oceanic airspace.  If coast-out is made at a radial/DME fix, the appropriate radial should be  selected  on  the  non-active  CDI  as  a  further  check  that  the  navigation  system  is tracking to the fix. 11.5.4.  Communications. In addition to guidance in Chapter 6, accomplish the following: 11.5.4.1.  Emergency Frequency Monitoring.  In the interest of safety during oceanic and remote  area  operations  (100  NM  offshore),  crews  will  maintain  a  listening  watch  on 121.5 and 243.0 MHz and the VHF common frequency. (T-2). 11.5.4.2.  BIU  Backup.    Ensure  that  a  pilot  places  their  transmission  switch  to  an  HF radio so that the crew can transmit on HF in case of BIU Backup.  The other pilot should select VHF 2 for the same reason.  VHF 1 is available on the Get Home Control and crew can  attempt  to  relay  transmissions  to  other  aircraft  on  121.5  until  within  VHF  range  of ATC. 11.5.5.  Oceanic Clearance.  If not received before take-off, the oceanic clearance should be obtained prior to the boundary of oceanic airspace IAW FLIP. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 137 11.5.5.1.  The PIC will designate the duties of flying the aircraft and copying/monitoring clearances  so  that  they  are  clearly  understood  by  all  crewmembers.  (T-2).      The  PM normally  receives  and  records  the  oceanic  clearance.  Both  pilots  will  monitor  and crosscheck to ensure that it has been copied correctly and clearly understood. (T-2). 11.5.5.2.  The  clearance  will  be  recorded  on  the  MFP,  and  reviewed  by  two  crew members.  (T-2).    If  the  oceanic  clearance  received  is  different  from  the  planned clearance, use the following procedures: 11.5.5.2.1.  Record  the  new  route  on  the  MFP  to  include  applicable  updates  to  ETP data. 11.5.5.2.2.  Enter  the  new  waypoints  into  the  CNI  IAW  the  pre-flight  procedures  in this chapter. 11.5.5.2.3.  Ensure fuel is still be sufficient to arrive at the destination waypoint with required reserves. 11.5.5.2.4.  Mark out the old plotted track and draw the revised plot on the MPC. 11.5.5.2.5.  In no case should this process simultaneously engage the attention of both pilots during flight. 11.5.6.  Approaching Coast-Out.  Prior to coast-out and outside of RNP RNAV airspace it is permissible and recommended to use the EGI or GPS (INAV source in AUTO mode) as the INAV solution  for both  CNI-SPs if NAVAIDs  are available for monitoring. Prior to  losing NAVAID reception, the flight crew must place the INAV solution that is not the controlling solution to INS. (T-1). This ensures there is constant comparison of the controlling solution to an independent INS solution.  Beginning at the coast-out waypoint and continuing through coast-in,  CNI-MU  bearing/range  between  INAV  solutions  should  be  recorded  at  each waypoint to provide a running record of INS drift relative to the controlling solution. 11.5.7.  IFF.  Reset Mode 3A code to 2000, 30 minutes after entering Category I airspace. 11.5.8.  MFP and MPC Procedures. Complete and/or comply with the following procedures: 11.5.8.1.  After  takeoff,  record  the  takeoff  time  in  the  Actual  Time  of  Arrival  (ATA) block of the departure airfield on the MFP.  As soon as practical after takeoff, determine a revised Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for each line of the MFP using flight-planned leg times and the actual departure time. 11.5.8.2.  Prior  to  waypoint  transition,  check  the  MFP  magnetic  course  and  distance  to the  next  waypoint  against  the  CNI-MU.    The  courses  should  be  within  2º  and  the distances should agree within approximately 2 NM.  Check and verify that the subsequent waypoint is properly programmed.  Update ETAs to the next two waypoints. 11.5.8.3.  Overhead  the  waypoint,  confirm  the  ATA  and  determine  the  minutes ahead/behind by  comparing it to  the ETA.  Record the CNI-MU bearing/range between INAV  solutions  to  provide  a  running  record  of  INS  drift  relative  to  the  controlling solution.  Record the actual fuel remaining above the flight-planned continuation fuel and write the difference between continuation fuel and actual fuel remaining in the EXCESS block  of  the  MPF.    See  the  in-flight  fuel  management  section  of  Chapter  12  for additional guidance and definitions. 138 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 11.5.8.4.  Immediately after waypoint passage, and as soon as the aircraft has intercepted its new course, confirm that the aircraft is outbound on its flight planned magnetic course to the next waypoint. 11.5.8.5.  Record the actual in-flight conditions (altitude, wind, and static air temperature (SAT))  above  the  forecast  conditions  on  the  next  line  of  the  MFP.    Update  these conditions as well as fuel flow as needed on the PERF CRUISE and LEGS pages in the CNI-MU. 11.5.8.6.  If  required,  complete  a  position  report  to  the  controlling  agency  IAW  FIH procedures.  The layout of the CNI PROGRESS page supports the format of the position report; however, ensure that ETAs passed to the controlling agency match the ETAs on the  MFP.    This  enables  the  pilots  to  determine  if  an  ETA  has  changed  from  what  was previously reported.   If  an ETA changes by more than 3 minutes, notify  the controlling agency. 11.5.8.7.  Draw a diagonal line through the waypoint on the MFP to indicate it has been passed,  reported,  and  all  applicable  annotations  associated  with  waypoint  passage  have been completed. 11.5.8.8.  Approximately  60  nm  (10  to  15  minutes  depending  on  groundspeed)  after waypoint  passage,  MARK  the  aircraft  position  and  plot  the  INS-only  position  on  the MPC.    Record  the  mark  time  and  position  coordinates  next  to  the  plot.    If  the  plotted position  is  not  within  2  NM  of  the  course  center-line,  check  waypoint  coordinates  for accuracy, ensure the autopilot is tracking correctly in NAV mode, re-check the accuracy of the charted course-line, and re-check that the position was plotted correctly. 11.5.8.9.  Cross  the  first  diagonal  on  the  MFP  to  indicate  that  the  aircraft  position  has been plotted. 11.5.8.10.  When the frequency of waypoints along CAT I route segments is greater than one every thirty minutes, full-line entries and plotting can be limited to a minimum of one every  hour.    Full-line  entries  with  the  corresponding  position  plot  are  mandatory  for every waypoint involving a change of heading over 20 degrees. 11.5.9.  Routine Monitoring. the 11.5.9.1.  Because  of altitude/steering modes, regular checks of correct engagement with the navigation system should be made. the  autopilot  disconnecting  from the  possibility  of 11.5.9.2.  Crews  should  monitor  aircraft  performance  and  outside  parameters,  suspect potential problem areas, and review the performance manual if the following conditions are encountered: 11.5.9.2.1.  The fuel remaining is less that the planned continuation fuel. 11.5.9.2.2.  Any Low Calculated Fuel CNI-MU advisory. 11.5.9.2.3.  ATA at any MFP fix is off by more than ± 5 minutes. 11.5.9.2.4.  SAT differs by more than ± 5ºC from flight planned. 11.5.9.2.5.  Actual winds differ by more than 30º or 15 knots from flight-planned. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 139 11.5.9.2.6.  Any Ahead/Behind Time more than 10% of total planned enroute time to that point. 11.5.9.2.7.  Hazardous meteorological conditions. 11.5.10.  Approaching Landfall.  Use the radar to help identify the coast-in position.  When the  aircraft  is  approaching  the  first  landfall  NAVAID,  tune  and  identify  the  navigation facility  and  crosscheck  the  aircraft  position.    If  coast-in  is  made  at  a  radial/DME  fix,  the appropriate  radial  should  be  selected  on  the  non-active  CDI  as  a  further  check  that  the navigation system is tracking according to the current clearance.  Once NAVAID reception is assured and flight is not being conducted in RNP RNAV airspace, all INAV solutions can be returned  to  AUTO.    If  entering  BRNAV  airspace,  AUTOTUNE  the  NAVAIDS,  select INS/RAD as the controlling solution, and place the other INAV solution in AUTO.  Revert to CAT II procedures.  Reset POS ALERT and IFF Mode 3 as appropriate. 11.6.  Special  Certification  Airspace  Requirements  and  Procedures.  Comply  with  the following procedures/guidance: 11.6.1.  The  GPS  installation  in  the  HC-130J  navigation  suite  does  not  meet  FAA certification  requirements  for  IFR  navigation  due  to  the  lack  of  Receiver  Autonomous Integrity  Monitoring  (RAIM)AFI  11-202V3  allows  the  GPS  to  be  used  as  a  mission enhancement  system  for  enroute  instrument  navigation,  if  it  is  used  to  update  a  self–contained navigation system, such as INS or mission computer, and is checked against other approved sources (in this case an RNP-10 certified INS).  Therefore, on CAT II routes (not including  operations  in  BRNAV  airspace),  the  EGI  or  GPS  can  be  used  as  the  controlling solution  for  enroute  instrument  navigation  if  NAVAIDs  are  available  for  monitoring.  The flight  crew  must  ensure  the  NAVAIDs  are  operational  and  actively  monitored.  (T-1).    If deviations are observed, crews should revert to navigation via ground based NAVAIDs.  For operations over CAT I routes (not including operations in RNP-10 airspace), the EGI or GPS can be used as the controlling solution providing the pilot can monitor its performance using the offside INS as an independent navigation source.  The EGI or GPS cannot be used as the controlling solution in BRNAV or RNP-10 airspace, even when using INS as the sole input source for the EGI. 11.6.2.  The HC-130J is certified for RNP-10 and Basic RNAV  (BRNAV)/RNP-5 airspace, but with operational time restrictions.  These certifications are based on raw INS data. 11.6.2.1.  RNP-10  airspace  requires  a  track  keeping  accuracy  of  10  NM  for  95%  of  the flight.  The track containment limit is 20 NM.  The HC-130J navigation system has been certified to meet the requirements of RNP-10 airspace for up to 10.4 hours from the time the  controlling  INS  was  commanded  to  the  NAV  mode.    The  pure  INS  solution  is  the only  certified  navigation  solution  for  flying  in  this  airspace.    Annotate  the  letter  “R”  in Block 10 of the DD Form 1801 or appropriate block of the ICAO flight plan to indicate RNP-10 certification. 11.6.2.1.1.  The clock can be reset for an additional 10.4 hours maximum, following an in-flight alignment of an INS.  Due to the lack of GPS RAIM, the flight crew must conduct in-flight alignments done for the purpose of extending RNP-10 airspace time must be conducted on only one INS at a time and within coverage of a NAVAID. (T-140 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 2).  Only after verifying the aircraft’s position within 0.3 NM of the first alignment, may an in-flight alignment be performed on the subsequent INS. 11.6.2.2.  BRNAV/RNP-5 airspace requires a track keeping accuracy of 5 NM for 95% of the flight.  The track containment limit is 10 NM.  Minimum equipment to operate in this airspace  is  one  INS  capable  of  updates.    The  INS/RAD  or  INS-only  solution  is  the controlling INAV solution in this airspace.  The INS/RAD solution can be used without time  restrictions  if  the  solution  is  being  updated  from  NAVAIDs.    If  the  NAVAIDs become  unreliable,  either  through  radio  failure  or  denial,  the  INS-only  solution  still maintains  BRNAV  accuracy  for  2.6  hours  from  the  time  the  controlling  INS  was commanded to the NAV mode.  If needed, an in-flight alignment may be used to restart the time-in-NAV of an INS prior to entry into this airspace.   The flight crew must select the INS/RAD or INS-only solution prior to entering BRNAV airspace. (T-1).  The flight crew must enable the AUTOTUNE function of the CNI-MS.  BRNAV airspace currently exists  throughout  the  European  Region.  (T-1).    Because  BRNAV  airspace  exists  only where NAVAID reception is available, CAT I procedures are not required.  Annotate the letter “R” in Block 10 of the DD Form 1801 or appropriate block of the ICAO flight plan to indicate BRNAV certification. 11.6.3.  Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  Airspace.    Airspace  where  RVSM is  applied  is  considered  special  qualification  airspace.  Both  the  operator  and  the  specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas. (T-2).  Refer to FLIP AP/2 and the following for RVSM requirements : 11.6.3.1.  The flight crew must ensure both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and the transponder, are fully operational. (T-1).  Request a new clearance to avoid this airspace should any of this equipment fail. 11.6.3.2.  Have  the  autopilot  engaged  during  level  cruise,  except  when  circumstances such as the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement. 11.6.3.3.  Crosscheck  the  altimeters  before  or  immediately  upon  coast  out.    Record  the readings of both altimeters. 11.6.3.4.  Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 ft. 11.6.3.5.  Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 ft per minute when operating near other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories. 11.6.3.6.  Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action. 11.6.3.7.  Document  in  the  aircraft  forms  malfunctions  or  failures  of  RVSM  required equipment. 11.6.4.  North  Pacific  Region  (NOPAC)  MNPS  airspace.    For  flights  in  NOPAC  MNPS airspace  comply  with the Anchorage/Tokyo  Oceanic  Control  Area/First-Impressions  Report;  Flight  Information Region  on  the  NOPAC  North  route.    The  following  minimum  operable  navigation  systems are mandatory: following  additional  procedures  when the transiting 11.6.4.1.  Prior to entering the NOPAC North route, the flight crew must ensure the radar and both EGI navigation systems are fully operational. (T-1). AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 141 11.6.4.2.  After entering the NOPAC North route: 11.6.4.2.1.  Aircraft  on  the  NOPAC  North  route  may  continue  without  functional radar, if radar is not required for weather avoidance, as long as both EGI systems are fully  functional  to  include  GPS  and  INS  inputs.    If  the  EGI  accuracy  cannot  be determined, either re-file a flight plan on another track (fuel permitting) or return to the nearest facility possessing maintenance capability. 11.6.4.2.2.  Aircraft  on  the  NOPAC  North  route  may  continue  with  only  one functional  EGI  system,  which  includes  both  GPS  and  INS  input,  or  two  functional INS  provided  the  radar  system  is  fully  functional.    Verify  in-flight  that  RADAR returns are available on  all ranges, particularly the 80, 160, and 320 NM ranges.   If the radar system is either marginal or inoperative, fuel permitting, re-file a flight plan to another track or return to the nearest facility possessing maintenance capability. 11.6.4.2.3.  Aircraft  that  do  not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraphs  11.6.4.1  or  11.6.4.2 will return to the nearest maintenance repair facility. (T-2). 11.7.  North Atlantic Tracks (NAT).  When flying over the North Atlantic, crews should obtain a copy of the NAT valid for their coast out time. 11.8.  Navigation  Malfunctions  and  Failures.  Complete  and/or  comply  with  the  following procedures/guidance: 11.8.1.  Should INAV solutions noticeably separate and exceed 8 NM, determine and use the INS  solution  considered  most  accurate  by  evaluating  both  INSs  using  available  radio  aids, ground mapping radar, and GPS.  Highest validity should be given to positions referenced via radar.  Next highest validity should be given to positions derived via radio aid fixing.  When left  to  determine  most  probable  position  (MPP)  via  navigation  solution  comparisons,  two agreeing INS positions are more valid than two agreeing GPSs; and two agreeing GPSs and one agreeing INS indicate a probable INS problem.  Consider INS-radar/NAVAID, INS-INS, and  INS-GPS  position  comparisons  that  are  less  than  4  NM  difference  to  be  valid  and  in agreement.   Once the most accurate  INS  is  determined, select  it as the controlling solution.  Update ETAs to ATC if required. 11.8.2.  Situations  may  arise  when  crews  cannot  identify  the  faulty  navigation  system  by simple  comparison  of  positions  between  navigation  solutions.    Fly  the  aircraft  halfway between  the  disagreeing  INS  solutions.    Plot  both  CNI-SP  solutions  at  least  once  every  30 minutes on the MPC, labeling the pilot CNI-SP navigation solution MPP1 and the copilot‘s MPP2.    Continue  to  evaluate  outputs  from  each  INS  and  try  to  use  plotted  position information to identify adverse trends. 11.8.3.  Malfunctions and failures in MNPS airspace: 11.8.3.1.  After  entering  MNPS  airspace,  flight  may  be  continued  with  a  minimum  of only  one  functional  INS  if  the  opposing  EGI  system  has  access  to  both  GPS  and  INS inputs. 11.8.3.2.  Crews  experiencing  deterioration  or  failure  of  navigation  equipment  that reduces  the  capability  to  comply  with  MNPS  prior  to  MNPS  entry  will  return  to  a suitable airfield with a maintenance repair facility. (T-2).  142 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 11.8.3.3.  Crews experiencing deterioration or failure of navigation equipment after entry into MNPS airspace should immediately report the malfunction to the controlling agency and  subsequent  agencies  throughout  the  route  of  flight.    Once  the  aircraft  has  entered oceanic  airspace,  the  PIC  should  continue  to  operate  the  aircraft  IAW  the  Oceanic Clearance already received, appreciating that the reliability of the total navigation system has  been  significantly  reduced.    The  PIC  should  also  prepare  a  proposal  to  ATC  with respect  to  the  prevailing  circumstances  and  consult  with  ATC  as  to  the  most  suitable action. 11.8.3.4.  If  an  aircraft  in  MNPS  airspace  is  unable  to  continue  flight  IAW  ATC clearance  for  reasons  such  as  severe  turbulence,  aircraft  performance  problems,  or pressurization  failure,  a  revised  clearance  should  be  obtained  as  soon  as  possible.    If unable  to  obtain  a  new  clearance,  offset  30  NM  from  the  assigned  route  by  turning  90 degrees  from  track  and  maintain  altitude  if  possible.    Once  offset  30  NM,  climb  or descend to an altitude which differs from those normally used by 500 ft. 11.8.4.  Malfunctions and failures in RNP-10 or BRNAV airspace: 11.8.4.1.  Aircraft unable to maintain RNP-10 or BRNAV RNAV tolerances must advise controlling agency immediately and take appropriate coordinated action. (T-1). AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 143 Chapter 12 FUEL PLANNING 12.1.  General.  This chapter is designed to assist planners and aircrews in fuel planning airland and  airdrop  missions,  with  or  without  low-level  segments.  ACs  must  have  a  fuel  plan  for  all flights.  The CFPS Computer Flight Plan (CFP) and T.O. 1C-130(H)J-1-1 Performance Manuals are the primary preflight references.  ACs must verify all preflight planning with aircraft mission computer (MC) performance prior to departure. (T-2).  Missions should be planned at altitudes, routes, and airspeeds to minimize fuel usage. 12.2.  Definitions.  The  following  definitions  apply  to  fuel  planning,  and  take  precedence  over similar definitions published elsewhere. 12.2.1.  Contingency Fuel:  An identified extra to compensate for unforeseen circumstances during any phase of flight (i.e. un-forecasted weather, launch delay, etc.) 12.2.1.1.  Terminal Fuel Flow (TFF). Hourly fuel flow from the last applicable cruise leg on the CFP. 12.2.2.  Required  Ramp  Fuel  Load  (RRFL):    Minimum  fuel  required  at  engine  start  to complete tasked mission. 12.2.3.  Depressurization Fuel:  Additional fuel required to protect the aircraft and occupants in  the  event  of  a  cabin  depressurization  followed  by  an  extended  diversion  to  an  alternate airport at low altitude where fuel consumption is increased. 12.2.4.  Tankered  Fuel:    Additional  fuel  carried  through  a  primary  destination  for  use  on  a subsequent leg. 12.2.5.  Wing  Relieving  Fuel:    Additional  fuel  kept  in  the  main  tanks  intended  to  counter wing bending moments and keep the aircraft within flight manual weight limitations. 12.3.  Alternate  Selection.  Plan  fuel  to  an  alternate  only  when  AFI  11-202V3  or  11-2HC-130JV3 VOL 3 require the filing of an alternate. 12.3.1.  When  only  one  alternate  is  mandatory,  use  the  closest  suitable  airfield  meeting mission  requirements  (such  as  special  requirements  for  hazmat  or  patients)  and  AFI  11-202V3 weather criteria. 12.3.2.  If  two  alternates  are  mandatory,  use  the  two  closest  suitable  airfields  meeting  AFI 11-202V3 weather criteria and fuel plan to the more distant of the two. 12.3.3.  When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields are preferred. 12.4.  Fuel Planning Profiles.  Divert profiles should be fully fuel planned and represent what is actually  going  to  be  flown.    Altitudes  should  be  no  higher  than  the  ATC  cruise  ceiling  per  the performance  manual.    Account  for  pre-planned  winds  during  fuel  planning  analysis.  For  fuel analysis,  use  Table  12.1,  Fuel  Load  Components  with  the  C130JHI.frm  PFPS  form  (non-air refueled) or AF Form 4139 (if receiver air refueled). The PFPS Fuel Analysis Tool can directly read the CFPS route and print a completed copy of AF Form 4139. 12.4.1.  Computer  Flight  Plans.  Print  the  CFPS  route  using  the  C130JHI.frm  form.  If  a destination alternate or an air refueling abort base is mandatory, use the Turnpoint/Additional 144 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 Points tool to insert the designated airfield as a DVT (divert) type after the intended landing airfield. 12.4.2.  Computer Fuel  Plans. Forms printed from  certified MAJCOM MPE are authorized.  ACs  must  ensure  the  computation  matches  aircraft  type,  configuration,  requirements  and limitations  for  the  mission  to  be  flown.  (T-2).    The  C-130J  Flight  Performance  Module (FPM) of PFPS is certified to calculate accurate fuel planning information for the HC-130J. Crews should use CFPS System Admin to verify the FPM version with TO 1C-130J-1-1 and note any differences. 12.4.2.1.  CFPS CFP Planning Profile.  The C130JHI.frm form permits both the route of flight and fuel planning information to be recorded.  Use the fuel planning blocks on the top of the flight plan and Table 12.1 for fuel planning.  Enroute and Minimum Landing Fuel are automatically printed.  Ensure an accurate Recovery Fuel is input on the CFPS Premission/Configuration/Fuel  screen  so  calculated  Continuation  Fuels  used  during  in-flight  fuel  monitoring  are  valid.    When  alternates  are  mandatory,  planners  may  need  to accomplish and print two iterations of the flight plan to incorporate an accurate Recovery Fuel.    For  example:  After  the  first  calculation,  extract  the  enroute  fuel  to  the  alternate from  the  last  line  of  the  flight  plan  and  add  this  to  the  initial  Recovery  Fuel.  A  second flight  plan  is  calculated  once  the  Premission/Configuration/Fuel  screen  is  updated  with the  correct  Recovery  Fuel.    If  an  alternate  is  mandatory,  use  the  Turnpoint/Additional Points  screen  to  insert  the  designated  airfield  as  a  DVT  (divert)  type  after  the  intended landing airfield. See Figure 12.2 for a sample of a completed CFPS CFP and Figure 12.3 for a sample of a completed fuel planning worksheet. 12.4.2.2.  Continuation  Fuel following formula:Continuation  Fuel  =  Fuel  Remaining  (beginning  of  leg)  –  Landing  Fuel  + Recovery Fuel is  calculated  using the for  each leg 12.4.3.  Non-Air Refueled Planning . En route cruise airspeed normally should be planned at a  constant  TAS.  Use  the  fuel  planning  blocks  at  the  top  of  the  printed C130JHI  flight  plan form  with  Table  12.1  for  fuel  analysis.  En  Route  and  Minimum  Landing  Fuel  are automatically printed. 12.4.4.  Air Refueled Planning. Use AF Form 4139 in place of the fuel planning blocks at the top of C130JHI.frm.  The AF Form 4139 is applicable to both single and multiple tanker air refueled  planning.  The  PFPS  Fuel  Analysis  Tool  can  be  used  to  produce  a  computerized version of this form directly from the CFPS route. The computerized version of the form is valid  for  up  to  four  receiver  air  refuelings.  All  items  are  self-explanatory  except  as  noted below. Items common to all sections:  Item A, OPERATING WEIGHT on the manual form is the basic aircraft operating weight plus the cargo/pax weight. The computerized version of the form has separate blocks for the two items. 12.4.4.1.  UNIDENTIFIED  EXTRA.  Can  not  be  negative.  If  necessary,  add  fuel  to  the Planned Ramp Fuel (item B) or the Planned Onload (items C, D, E, or F). Alternatively, move the air refueling track or add another air refueling. 12.4.4.2.  GROSS WT. Not required. 12.4.4.3.  TEMP DEV. Not required. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 145 12.4.4.4.  TAKEOFF TO EAR 1 Section: 12.4.4.5.  ENROUTE  (Item  1).  CFPS  Clock  Time  and  Total  Fuel  at  EAR  1  (prior  to onload), minus STTO fuel from line 1. Subtract the helicopter/tiltrotor refueling offload (if any) from Fuel  and add it to  Item 3,  Identified Extra. The PFPS Fuel  Analysis  Tool performs this correction automatically. 12.4.4.6.  IDENTIFIED  EXTRA  (Item  3).  Include  1000  pounds  per  hour  for  the  time anticipated at lower altitude on the track prior to and during actual air refueling. Do not enter if the CFP takes into account the altitude change for the refueling. 12.4.4.7.  RESERVE (Item 5). Ten percent of the Category I time from takeoff to end air refueling, not to exceed +45 minutes. Compute at TFF. 12.4.4.8.  FUEL AT EAR #1 (No Onload) (B-6) (Item  7). Planned Ramp Fuel  (item  B) minus Total (item 6). This is the fuel remaining at EAR 1 prior to onload. 12.4.4.9.  PLANNED EAR #1 FUEL (Item 8). Planned fuel at EAR 1 including the fuel onload. 12.4.4.10.  EAR 1 TO AR 1 ABORT BASE: 12.4.4.10.1.  This  section  accounts  for  an  unsuccessful  fuel  transfer.  Plan  an  abort base  for  all  receiver  air  refueling  operations.  The  departure  base  may  be  used.  The designated abort base must meet alternate airfield weather requirements. (T-2). 12.4.4.11.  EN ROUTE (Item 9). CFPS DVT time from the EAR to the abort base. 12.4.4.12.  RESERVE (Item 10). Ten percent of the DVT time from EAR to abort base. The combined total for item 5 plus item 10 can not exceed +45 minutes. If the combined total exceeds +45, reduce Item 10 to bring the total down to +45. Entry is only required when the flight time from the EAR to the abort base exceeds 1+30. Compute at TFF. 12.4.4.13.  AAR #1 ABORT ALTERNATE (Item 11). Optional entry. 12.4.4.14.  HOLDING (Item 12). Use 3000 pounds if the AR abort base is in Alaska or at latitudes greater than 59 degrees N/S. 12.4.4.15.  PLANNED  RAMP  FUEL  (Item  16).  Required  to  be  greater  than  Item  17, Required Ramp Fuel. 12.4.4.16.  REQUIRED  RAMP  FUEL  (Item  17).  Sum  of  the  totals  in  Items  6  and  15. This  is  the  fuel  required  to  fly  from  departure  to  the  end  air  refueling  point  and  then continue to the abort base with required reserves if the transfer is unsuccessful. 12.4.4.17.  EAR  1  TO  EAR  2  Section.  Not  applicable  to  single  air  refueling  planning. The computerized AF Form 4139 also supports EARs 3 and 4 using procedures identical to this section. Items in this segment are identical to the TAKEOFF TO EAR 1 section, but the ENROUTE TIME and FUEL values are the differences in CFPS Clock Time and Total Fuel between the next EAR (prior to onload) and the previous EAR (after onload). 12.4.4.18.  EAR  TO  DESTINATION  Section:    Items  separated  by  a  diagonal  (  /  )  are applicable  to  both  single  and  multiple  air  refueling  missions.  Use  the  item  letter  or number that corresponds to the final refueling. 146 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 12.4.4.19.  EN  ROUTE  (Item  38).  The  differences  in  CFPS  Clock  Time  and  Total  Fuel between destination/IAF and the final EAR line after onload. 12.4.4.20.  RESERVE  (Item  39).  Ten  percent  of  the  Category  I  time  from  EAR  to destination/IAF, not to exceed +45. Compute at TFF. 12.4.4.21.  HOLDING  (Item  41).  Use  3000  pounds  if  abort  base  is  in  Alaska  or  at latitudes greater than 59 degrees N/S. 12.4.4.22.  REQUIRED  EAR  TO  DEST  (Item  44).  This  is  the  fuel  required  at  the  final EAR to arrive at the destination/IAF with required reserves. 12.4.5.  HC-130J  CNI-MS  Profile.    The  HC-130J  CNI-MS  plans  a  complete  climb,  cruise, descent, approach and landing profile based on the inserted LEGS DATA and PERF CLIMB, CRUISE,  and  DESCENT  factors.    Accurate  leg  fuels,  as  calculated  by  the  CNI-MS,  are dependent  on  crews  ensuring  that  airspeed,  altitude,  winds,  temperature,  and  fuel  flow  are correctly  represented for each leg of the route and updated/corrected as in-flight  conditions change.    Because  the  flight  profile  is  more  than  a  planning  tool,  use  good  judgment  when inputting  forecast/planned  information  versus  actual  performance  and  conditions.  During preflight and at each waypoint, the flight crew must compare the Fuel On Board (FOB) for remaining legs against the flight planned Continuation Fuel to ensure there is sufficient fuel to continue the mission as planned in order to meet or exceed destination fuel requirements. (T-2). Once airborne, the FOB on the PERF INIT WEIGHT page is calculated (not sensed) using sensed Fuel Flow versus Time.  Update the FOB on the PERF INIT WEIGHT page to the  amount  indicated  by  the  totalizer  only  when  the  totalizer  amount  is  less  than  the calculated FOB.  Use the most conservative of the FOB or totalizer readings when recording fuel  remaining  during  in-flight  fuel  monitoring.    The  CNI-MS  provides  a  FUEL  QTY ERROR advisory when the PERF INIT WEIGHT FOB and totalizer readings differ by more than  2500  lbs  for  more  than  10  minutes.    Set  the  FIXED  reserve  fuel  on  PERF  INIT WEIGHT  to  the  Recovery  Fuel  value.    Set  the  +EXTRA  reserve  fuel  on  PERF  INIT WEIGHT  to  the  Unidentified  Extra  fuel  value.  The  CNI-MS  then  alerts  the  crew  to  a deteriorating fuel situation by generating two Low Calculated Fuel advisories: one when the Unidentified  Extra  fuel  is  burnt  and  a  second  one  when  the  Recovery  Fuel  is  burnt.  Destination and Alternate Landing Fuel can be obtained from the CNI-MS.  Use the CNI-MS to evaluate and verify destination landing fuel status after mission changes and reroutes and whenever a divert is necessary and/or extensive weather avoidance routing is necessary. 12.5.  Fuel  Analysis.  Aircrew  and  mission  planners  manage  aviation  fuel  as  a  limited commodity  and  precious  resource.    Fuel  optimization  is  considered  throughout  all  phases  of mission planning and execution.  Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft gross weight and increases fuel consumption.  Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum requirements for safe mission accomplishment and training objectives.  Aircrew and mission planners should optimize flight  plans  and  flight  routing  for  fuel  efficiency.    In-flight  procedures  such  as  climb/descent profiles  and  power  settings  should  also  be  considered  for  efficient  fuel  usage.    Due  to  the dynamic  nature  of  CSAR,  fuel  optimization  may  not  always  be  possible  due  to  airborne  alert status,  unknown  orbit  times,  and  TEXACO  procedures.    Alert  fuel  loads  should  be  carefully considered  to  plan  for  these  circumstances  while  practicing  good  fuel  management.    Aircrew should  employ  the  following  aviation  fuel  optimization  measures  without  compromising  flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment: AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 147 12.5.1.  Plan  a  45-minute  fuel  reserve  at  destination  or  alternate  (when  an  alternate  is necessary.) 12.5.2.  For  remote  destinations,  holding  is  authorized  in  lieu  of  an  alternate  airport.  Use 3000 lbs for holding fuel in this case. 12.5.3.  For  all  missions,  calculate  an  additional  15  minutes  of  contingency  fuel.  Contingency fuel should not be considered reserve fuel since crews may burn some or all of their  contingency  fuel.    Contingency  fuel  is  included  in  the  initial  required  ramp  fuel  load (RRFL.) 12.5.4.  Reserve  and  contingency  fuel  are  computed  using  consumption  rates  providing maximum endurance at  10,000 ft MSL.  When computing reserve and contingency fuel for remote destinations, use consumption rates providing maximum endurance at 20,000 ft MSL. 12.5.5.  Calculate CAT 1 fuel reserve as 10% of flight time fuel over the CAT 1 route/route segment, not to exceed +45 minutes of fuel at TFF. 12.5.6.  Thunderstorm  forecasts  are  based  on  the  DD  Form  175-1  or  equivalent.    Where weather forecast conditions dictate, add the following fuel corrections to Identified Extra: 12.5.6.1.  1,000 lbs if the route of flight has known or forecast icing conditions. 12.5.6.2.  1,500 lbs if forecast thunderstorms are scattered or numerous along the route of flight. 12.5.7.  Approach fuel is 700 lbs, not required for a planned enroute descent. 12.5.8.  Minimum  landing  fuel  is  3,000  lbs.    This  fuel  accounts  for  gauge  errors.    Do  not include this 3,000 lbs  of fuel  in  the 45-minute fuel  reserve and 15 minute contingency fuel calculations. 12.5.9.  Using  all  available  planning  tools  and  guidance  in  this  chapter,  PICs  determine  the RRFL.  In all cases, the PIC is the final authority for determining the actual fuel required for a mission. 12.5.10.  Wing Relieving Fuel. 12.5.10.1.  Calculate  Wing  Relieving  Fuel  using  the  flight  manual  weight  limitations chart for the aircraft‘s planned cargo load.  Enter the chart with the aircraft empty weight and cargo weight, then read across to determine the fuel required to remain within limits.  Add enough Wing Relieving Fuel, if required, to ensure that Recovery Fuel does not fall below the fuel required to remain within limits. 12.5.10.2.  Units will ensure all local and JA/ATT missions flying low-level will initially takeoff  with  main  tanks  full  to  reduce  the  effects  of  wing  upbending  and  increase  the center wingbox service life. (T-2).  Decreased takeoff fuel in the main tanks can decrease the center wingbox service life as much as 47 percent. 12.5.11.  Optimize  Fuel  Loads.    Mission  plan  for  the  required  ramp  and  recovery  fuel.  Ensure ramp fuel is correct upon arrival at aircraft. 12.5.12.  Minimize use of APUs.  Use ground power units when practical. 148 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 12.5.13.  Delay  engine  start  time.    Units  should  establish  and  implement  local  engines  start time standards. 12.5.14.  Minimize aircraft weight through optimized fuel loads and reduction of equipment not necessary to accomplish the mission. 12.5.15.  Establish  C2  and  flight  following  procedures  to  ensure  timely  notification  of mission changes/cancellations to avoid unnecessary or unproductive flight time. 12.6.  Depressurization  Fuel.  Pressurization  Loss  fuel  is  applicable  when  carrying  passengers and oxygen is not available to them. 12.7.  In-Flight  Fuel  Management.  For  a  flight  plan  and  corresponding  fuel  log  to  be  most meaningful for in-flight fuel monitoring, the actual cruise altitude should be no lower than 2000 ft below planned altitude and the airspeed no lower than planned airspeed –10 KTAS or higher than  planned  airspeed  +  10  KTAS.    If  initial  cruise  conditions  do  not  fall  within  these parameters, the PIC should strive to reach (or beat) them as soon as possible. 12.7.1.  Monitor fuel  consumption  by comparing  the FOB to  predicted  Fuel  Remaining and the  required  Continuation  Fuel  on  the  flight  plan.  At  a  minimum,  accomplish  and  record consumption comparisons on the Master Flight Plan (MFP): 12.7.1.1.  As soon as practical after initial level off. 12.7.1.2.  At convenient waypoint intervals not to exceed 1 hour. 12.7.1.3.  At  convenient  waypoint  intervals  not  to  exceed  30  minutes  if  aircraft performance  is  critical  or  marginal  (actual  fuel  is  less  than  Continuation  Fuel,  icing conditions, weather avoidance, etc.) 12.7.1.4.  Any time re-routing occurs or a lower altitude than what was flight-planned is to be flown. 12.7.1.5.  After onload or offload is complete for air-to-air refueling missions. 12.7.2.  When proceeding to an air refueling abort base after aborting an air refueling onload, compute  the  Recovery  Fuel  based  on  required  reserves  at  the  abort  base.  Reset  FIXED  on PERF  INIT  WEIGHT  to  match  the  new  Recovery  Fuel.  Use  the  CNI-MS  to  monitor  fuel consumption as for non-air refueled missions. 12.7.3.  Inflight fuel management may be discontinued at the discretion of the PIC when the following conditions have been met: 12.7.3.1.  The Equal Time Point (ETP) has been crossed (CAT I routes.) 12.7.3.2.  Fuel systems and quantity indicators are functioning normally. 12.7.3.3.  There is obvious extra fuel and the +EXCESS fuel trend is favorable. 12.7.4.  On  CAT  I  routes,  prior  to  the  ETP,  if  the  EXCESS  fuel  becomes  negative  the  PIC will consider and accomplish one of the following recommended actions: (T-1) 12.7.4.1.  Change the flight profile to ensure planned performance is reacquired and Fuel Reserves at destination is met or exceeded. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 149 12.7.4.2.  Continue and land short of the intended destination (i.e., First Suitable Airfield (FSAF)) or proceed to intended destination based on an updated weather forecast that no longer requires an alternate. 12.7.4.3.  Return to the departure base or the Last Suitable Airfield (LSAF). 12.7.5.  Flight  Plan  Changes  and  Diversion.  When  mission  requirements  or  ATC  dictate  a change  to  the  planned  mission  or  route,  the  flight  crew  must  recalculate  the  fuel  to  ensure safe  completion of the  flight.  (T-2).   It  is  not  practical  to  complete  a new PFPS flight  plan and fuel log, so the CNI-MS is the primary method of deciding if a mission change or reroute can be accommodated. 12.7.5.1.  For  an  unplanned  or  directed  enroute  divert,  the  FROM/TO  page,  with  an associated  cruise  ground  speed,  can  be  used  to  determine  an  Estimated  Time  Enroute (ETE).  Using a 4000 lbs/hr fuel burn, crews should be able to decide if the new routing is  achievable  without  adverse  effects  on  destination  fuel.    Do  not  accept  a  reroute  that adversely depletes the destination Reserve Fuel as prescribed in this chapter. 12.7.5.2.  If the enroute change does not affect the intended destination, then in-flight fuel monitoring  consists  of  comparing  the  CNI-MS  predicted  Remaining  Fuel  with  Flight Plan  Continuation  Fuel  at  the  next  point  common  to  the  reroute  and  the  original  flight plan.  After any route alteration, crews should actively monitor fuel state by recording the Fuel  Remaining  values  at  abeam  positions  of  the  original  flight  plan  and  using  the “Abeam” function of the INDEX/FIX INFO PAGE to crosscheck fuel status. 12.7.6.  Declare “Emergency Fuel” IAW the T.O. 1C-130(H)J-1.  Declare “Minimum Fuel” to ATC when it is determined that the aircraft is going to land with less than 3000 lbs plus the Required Reserve.    NOTE:  According to the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) Pilot/Controller  Glossary,  “Minimum  Fuel  indicates  that  an  aircraft’s  fuel  supply  has reached a state where, upon reaching the destination, it can accept little or no delay.  This is not  an  emergency  situation  but  merely  indicates  an  emergency  situation  is  possible  should any undue delay occur.”  Furthermore the AIM states that “a minimum fuel advisory does not imply a need for traffic priority.  If the remaining useable fuel supply suggests the need for traffic priority to ensure a safe landing, you should declare an emergency due to low fuel and report fuel remaining in minutes.” Table 12.1.  Fuel Load Components. EN ROUTE  STTO FUEL PLANNING Fuel required from takeoff through landing at the intended destination. Components include climb, cruise, and approach fuel. Enroute fuel will be obtained from the CFPS CFP or the Fuel Analysis Tool. For planned enroute descent to destination or alternate, use a CFPS Approach leg (“AP” point type) with Fuel set to 700 lbs. CFPS uses this fuel for the entire distance of the Approach leg.   For air refueled missions, En Route is the fuel (excluding onload) required from takeoff through the first EAR, or between EARs, or from the final EAR through destination IAF or landing. Fuel required for engine start, taxi, and takeoff. Normally 800 lbs. 150 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 CAT I RESERVE ALTERNATE REQUIRED RESERVE CONTINGENCY FUEL HOLDING FUEL MINIMUM LANDING FUEL  RECOVERY FUEL CONTINUATION FUEL TANKERED FUEL UNIDENTIFIED EXTRA WING RELIEVING FUEL WEATHER AVOIDANCE ICING KNOWN HOLDING DELAYS For known taxi delays or additional engine running ground time in excess of 30 minutes, add 30 lbs/min. Fuel for 10% of enroute time along a CAT I route/segment, not to exceed +45 minutes of flight time. Compute at TFF. Fuel required from intended destination to alternate, or most distant alternate when two are required. Flown at optimum cruise altitude, using direct routing to the alternate at LRC airspeed. Fuel for a missed approach (2000 lbs) and second approach at the alternate airfield is required when the visibility-only weather criteria is used to determine the suitability of the original destination. 45 minute reserve, using maximum endurance airspeed at 10,000 ft MSL (20,000 ft remote fields.) Required overhead destination or alternate (if alternate is needed.) 30 minutes, using max endurance airspeed at 10,000 ft MSL (20,000 ft MSL for remote fields.) Use 3000 lbs when the alternate or AR abort base is located in Alaska, or is located at latitudes greater than 59 degrees N/S. 3000 lbs (Required.) If it is determined that the aircraft will land with less than this amount, a fuel emergency exists and ATC must be informed. This entry is separate from required reserve and contingency fuel. Sum of MINIMUM LANDING FUEL, HOLDING FUEL, and  ALTERNATE or AAR ABORT FUEL (if required). Also add any applicable Identified Extra categories, e.g. fuel for icing between the destination and alternate or AAR abort base. Used to calculate accurate Continuation Fuels for each leg; it must be updated in the Premission Configuration screen of CFPS. Fuel required at the beginning of each leg to be able to proceed to the intended destination and land with the required Recovery Fuel. Fuel for succeeding legs without refueling. The difference between RRFL and actual ramp fuel. For air refueled missions, also the difference between Planned EAR and Required EAR fuel. Must never be negative.   Additional fuel kept in the main tanks intended to counter wing bending moments and keep the aircraft within flight manual weight limitations. 1,500 lbs if forecast thunderstorms are scattered or numerous along the route of flight. 1,000 lbs if the route of flight has known or forecast icing conditions. Fuel for anticipated/planned holding, including remote destinations. Compute at Four-Engine Maximum Endurance Fuel Flow. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 151 Figure 12.1.

HC-130J Master Flight Plan Example (Page 2 of 2).  AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 153 Chapter 13 AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES 13.1.  General.  This  chapter  contains  aircrew  procedures  not  contained  in  the  flight  manual, other portions of this AFI, or other readily available publications. 13.2.  Responsibilities.  Aircrew  may  assist  the  normal  maintenance  function  when  critical contingency taskings dictate their use, provided this action does not impact crew duty and crew rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI. 13.3.  Authority to Clear a Red X.  Aircrews are not normally authorized to clear a Red X.  If a situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are not  available  to  clear  it,  the  PIC  may  obtain  authorization  to  clear  the  Red  X  from  the  home station  MXG/CC  or  designated  representative,  in  accordance  with  T.O.  00-20-1,  Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedure. 13.3.1.  At  enroute  stations,  LMs  are  authorized  to  clear  Red  X  symbols  for:  intake  and exhaust  inspections,  dust  covers  and  plugs  installed,  and  aircraft  panels  removed  and installed  to  facilitate  other  maintenance  when  qualified  maintenance  personnel  are  not available. 13.3.2.  In-Process  Inspections.  LMs  must  be  aware  of  their  responsibility  to  perform  in-process inspections when clearing Red X symbols. (T-2).  During the assembly where further assembly  prevents  the  required  inspection  of  the  item,  the  LM  must  perform  an  in-process inspection. (T-2).  Document the inspection IAW TO 00-20-1. 13.4.  Forms  Management.  In  addition  to  the  procedures  in  TO  00-20-1  and  AFI  11-401,  the CSO/LM assists the PIC in maintaining the AFTO Form 781.  Verify the exceptional release is signed before flight and resigned, if necessary, at enroute stops. 13.4.1.  After  each  flight,  ensure  the  number  of  discrepancies  (if  any),  landings,  and  flight duration time(s), etc., are entered on the AFTO 781H.  Review all AFTO 781A discrepancies to  ensure  symbols,  date  discovered,  and  clear,  detailed  entries  were  entered  and  the discovered by blocks are completed for each discrepancy. 13.4.2.  The  PIC  must  log  all  off-station  fuel  purchases  (to  include  FARP  and  in-flight refueling)  on  AFTO  781H  and  AF  Form  664  (IAW  AFI  11-253,  Managing  Off-Station Purchases  of  Aviation  Fuel  and  Ground  Services,  and  AFI  23-111,  Management  of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force), if applicable. (T-2). 13.4.3.  IAW AFMAN 23-110CD, Air Force Supply Systems Electronic Publishing Library, record  all  in-flight  transfers  from  C-130  tanker  aircraft  to  any  receiver  aircraft  on  the  DD Form  791.    Accomplish  the  DD  Form  791  for  Forward  Area  Refueling  Point  (FARP)  off-loads and fuel jettison in excess of 1,000 lbs. Turn completed forms in during maintenance debrief. 13.5.  Aircraft  Servicing  and  Ground  Operations.  Aircrews  are  normally  not  required  to service  the  aircraft;  however,  they  are  qualified  and  authorized  to  perform  those  aircrew maintenance support tasks found in  this volume.  The  aircrew performs  these tasks only in the absence  of  qualified  maintenance  personnel  and  is  designed  for  support  of  the  aircraft  and  its 154 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 mission  while  away  from  home  station.    Without  exception,  aircrews  will  use  the  applicable checklists/job guides during all refueling and defueling operations. (T-2). 13.5.1.  Liquid  Oxygen  (LOX)  Servicing.    Crewmembers  will  not  service  liquid  oxygen under any conditions. (T-2). 13.5.2.  Aircraft  Refueling.

Flight monitoring.  Monitor all applicable aircraft systems during all phases of flight and ground operations and notify the PIC of all abnormal indications then take the appropriate action. 14.9.  Channel Cargo and Passenger Missions. in  planning  of  proposed 14.9.1.  Channel  Cargo.  HC-130J aircraft do not routinely airlift  channel  cargo;  however, if tasked,  contact  the  Air  Terminal  Operations  Center  (ATOC),  Airlift  Control  Element (ALCE),  or  air  freight/passenger  service  to  obtain  the  cargo  and  passenger  breakdown  and assist the cargo/passengers  being  carried  will  be  briefed  to  the  loadmaster  during  the  initial  load briefing at ATOC. At stations where aircraft tie-down equipment is exchanged, make every effort to ensure that a one-for-one exchange occurs. If this is not possible, inform the PIC of lost  or  missing  equipment  and  annotate  missing  items  on  the  aircraft  Dash  21  Equipment Inventory, refer to AFTO IMT Form 781. load.  If  necessary,  security  requirements  for 14.9.2.  Passenger Missions. 14.9.3.  HC-130J  aircraft  will  not  normally  be  tasked  to  support  Air  Mobility  Command passenger missions, nor will passengers be manifested or loaded aboard aircraft without the prior approval of the PIC/mission commander. (T-2). 14.9.4.  Prior to releasing seats, ensure terminal operations passenger handling personnel are aware that passenger comfort latrine facilities are extremely limited, and of the possibility of an in-flight diversion. 14.10.  Passenger  Handling.  The  loadmaster  is  the  key  figure  concerning  good  passenger relations.  Be  aware  of  the  doubts  and  fears  that  may  arise  in  the  minds  for  passengers  and anticipate their questions and actions. 14.10.1.  Comments  by  the  Loadmaster  and  the  manner  in  which  they  are  made  often determines  passenger  attitudes  about  the  flight  and  its  crew.  Always  address  and  handle passengers with respect and professionalism. 14.10.2.  Loadmasters will ensure frequent checks of cargo compartment cabin temperature, passenger safety/comfort, and cleanliness of the cargo compartment. (T-2). 14.10.3.  Passengers  may  move  about  the  cargo  compartment.  Good  judgment  must  be exercised  on  the  number  of  passengers  allowed  out  of  their  seats  at  one  time.  Encourage passengers to keep seat belts fastened when seated. 14.10.4.  LMs  will  not  allow  passengers  to  lounge  on  or  tamper  with  equipment,  cargo,  or baggage and ensure passengers are not allowed access to checked baggage. (T-2). 14.10.5.  LMs will ensure that classified equipment remains secured during the entire mission when passengers are onboard and ensure passengers are denied access to this equipment. (T-2). 14.11.  Troop  Movements.  Most personnel  carried aboard the aircraft are aboard to perform  a specific mission. Every effort should be made to advise them of mission progress and deviations. Identify the troop commander prior to boarding. 14.11.1.  Determine if the troop commander has any special requirements prior to departure, and advise the PIC of these requirements, if appropriate. 160 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 14.11.2.  Determine  if  specific  communications  requirements  exist  and  coordinate  these requirements with the PIC. 14.11.3.  Determine if there is a need for the troops to perform any type of in-flight rigging. Ensure the aircraft is  loaded to  accommodate in-flight  rigging if necessary.  Inform the PIC prior to in-flight rigging. If turbulence is anticipated, the PIC should inform the loadmaster as much in advance as possible. 14.11.4.  LMs  ensure  that  troops  do  not  have  access  to  aircraft  classified  equipment  during the mission. (T-2).    If troops require access to classified equipment, the requirement should be made known to the PIC prior to the mission. 14.11.5.  Passenger  Combat  Loading.  Floor  loading  is  authorized  to  support  dedicated unconventional  forces  and  foreign  counterparts  during  operations,  exercises,  and  training. Standard  seating  configurations  listed  in  applicable  addenda  should  be  used,  if  practical. EXCEPTION: Group commander (COMAFSOF for contingency operations) may authorize Rapid  Infil/Exfil  procedures  and  floor  loading  with  non-SOF  personnel.  NOTE:  This procedure  will  not  be  used  in  lieu  of  providing  normal  seating  when  available.  (T-2).  WARNING: During passenger combat loading, the loadmaster will ensure all occupants are provided  restraint  IAW  AFTTP  3-3  HC-130/J.  (T-2).    At  no  time  shall  the  number  of combat-loaded personnel exceed five across per row. (T-2).  The loadmaster shall not exceed the aircraft’s maximum allowable gross weight or center of gravity limitations. (T-2).  Adult passenger weight shall not be calculated at less than 175 pounds per person. (T-2). 14.11.6.  The  LM  will  ensure  all  personnel  in  the  cargo  compartment  will  be  seated  and secured except those crew members having valid duties to perform. (T-2). 14.11.7.  Combat Loading. Combat loading is comprised of three types of operations: combat off-load, passenger combat loading, and infil/exfil. 14.11.8.  Combat  Off-load  Training.  No  special  authorization  is  necessary  for  combat  off-load training using unilateral training loads. 14.12.  Supporting/Supported  Forces  Procedures.  The  loadmaster  will  ensure  forces  are properly manifested as passengers. (T-2). Give one copy of the manifest to the PIC for filing and retain  sufficient  copies  for  border  clearance.    The  loadmaster  will  ensure  completion  of antihijacking requirements for forces in accordance with AFI 13-207 and this instruction. (T-2). 14.13.  Border  Clearance.  Customs,  Immigration,  and  Agriculture  require  certain  forms  for border  clearance.  (T-2)  The  loadmaster  will  ensure  that  necessary  forms  are  contained  in  the aircraft mission kit, distribute the forms to the crew and ensure their completion prior to landing; deliver them to the proper persons and also comply with the requirements of this instruction. 14.14.  Weight and Balance.  The LM will accomplish weight and balance computation for the aircraft  in  accordance  with  T.O.  1-1B-50.  (T-2).    A  basic  handbook  of  weight  and  balance containing  current  aircraft  status  is  maintained  by  the  unit  possessing  the  aircraft.  A supplemental weight and balance handbook for each aircraft is stored on board. This is a binder containing a certified copy of Chart C providing the current basic weight and moment, and also includes the applicable T.O. 1C-130(M)X-5, and this AFI’s addenda. Sufficient blank copies of DD Form 365-4 for the anticipated mission(s) will be onboard prior to flight. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 161 14.14.1.  The  LM  will  compute  weight  and  balance  either  using  the  Chart  E  mathematical (moments) method or approved Automated Form F (AFF) software and compute DD Form 365-4 in accordance with this AFI’s Addenda A. (T-2). 14.14.2.  Presently AFF software does not accommodate HC-130J airframes. If used, Center of  Gravity  limits  for  takeoff  and  landing  must  be  physically  checked  against  T.O  1C-130M(X)-5. Estimated landing  fuel  function will also  be used as software does not  support HAAR, AAR, and present ACC fuel burn rates. These items are annotated in the additional remarks  block  of  the  AAF.  Two  copies  are  printed,  one  remains  onboard  until  mission termination, and leave the other copy with air terminal/maintenance personnel remaining on the ground. 14.14.3.  The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the aircraft is responsible for providing the appropriate agency with information necessary to keep documents current and accurate. 14.14.4.  Ensure correct data is entered into CNI-MU weight and balance pages. 14.15.  Fuel  Weight  Computation.  To  compute  takeoff  fuel  weight  entered  on  the  DD  Form 365-4, read directly from the fuel totalizer gauge or fuels payload page on the CNIMU for total fuel weight. Compute limiting wing fuel computations using the charts in the appropriate flight manual, this AFI’s Addenda A, or AFF software. 14.16.  Combat  Loading.  Combat  loading  is  comprised  of  three  types  of  operations:  Combat Offload,  Passenger  Combat  Loading,  and  Infil/Exfil  procedures.    See  AFTTP3-3.HC-130  for additional  guidance.    LM  will  ensure  all  personnel  in  the  cargo  compartment  are  seated  and secured except those personnel having valid duties to perform. (T-2). 14.16.1.  Combat Offload.  Combat Offload provides a means of off-loading single, multiple, and  married  pallets;  ramp  and  airdrop  platforms;  and  CDS  containers  without  the  use  of Material  Handling  Equipment  (MHE).    OG/CCs  or  deployed  equivalent  may  authorize combat  off-load  when  hostile  conditions  or  similar  situations  warrant  the  use  of  these procedures.  The method of combat offload will be determined by the aircrew based on the conditions at the offload site. 14.16.2.  Combat Offload Method A. 14.16.3.  A taxiway or ramp at least 500 ft long is necessary; however, 1,000 ft is desired to provide  a  margin  of  safety.    When  pallets,  platforms,  or  containers  are  offloaded  one  at  a time,  use a longer taxiway based on the number to be offloaded.  Explosives and munitions shall not be combat offloaded unless approved by MAJCOM/A3 or deployed equivalent. (T-2).    EXCEPTION:    Small  arms  ammunition  (hazard  class  and  division  1.4)  and explosives/munitions  rigged  for  airdrop  may  be  combat  offloaded.    WARNING:    Many explosive  items  have  specific  drop  criteria  that,  if  exceeded,  render  the  item  useless  or dangerous  to  the  user.    CAUTION:    When  using  Method  A  on  excessively  rough,  sharply undulating,  or  battle-damaged  surfaces,  damage  to  the  aircraft  ramp  may  occur.    Reducing forward taxi speed on these surfaces will reduce aircraft oscillation.  The PIC must determine if  the  offload  area  permits  the  offload  operation  to  be  conducted  without  damage  to  the aircraft or equipment. 162 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 14.16.4.  Combat offload of fragile and sensitive cargo items (i.e., computers) that might be damaged  by  standard  Method  A  combat  offload  procedures  will  not  be  attempted  without user concurrence.  If the nature of the mission dictates that cargo must be offloaded, aircrews may  lower  the  ramp  to  approximately  18  inches  above  the  ground.    CAUTION:    Do  not attempt to lower the ramp below horizontal unless the UNRESTRICTED RAMP TRAVEL light  is  illuminated.    EXCEPTION:    UNRESTRICTED  RAMP  TRAVEL  light  will  not illuminate  when  cargo  compartment  lights  are  in  the  covert  position.    NOTE:    Normal Method  A  procedures  cannot  be  used  with  the  ramp  below  the  horizontal  position.  In  this case the LM must release the locks using either the PLCUs or RECP Jettison switches. 14.16.5.  Pallets  may  be  offloaded,  without  ballast,  using  Method  A  procedures  provided their total weight does not exceed 12,000 lbs, and the height of the pallets fall within cargo height  jettison  limit  in  section  III  of  the  flight  manual  or  section  V  of  the  cargo  loading manual. 14.16.6.  Airdrop  rigged  platforms  up  to  24  ft  in  length  may  be  offloaded,  without  ballast, using  Method  A  procedures  provided  their  weight  does  not  exceed  12,000  lbs.    NOTE:  Pallets and airdrop rigged platforms over 12,000 lbs total weight may be offloaded using this method, provided ballast or cargo equal to the difference between 12,000 lbs and the weight of  the  pallets  or  platforms  (to  be  offloaded)  remains  in  C  through  F  compartments  during offload.    Example:    A  17,000  lb  married  pallet  or  airdrop  platform  requires  5,000  lbs  of ballast or cargo to remain in C through F compartments during the offload. 14.16.7.  CDS  may  be  combat  offloaded  using  Method  A  procedures.    The  static  line retriever will be used via manual activation; manual gate cut may be done if the retriever is inoperative.    With  Centerline  Vertical  Restraint  (CVR),  offload  will  be  accomplished  one side  at  a  time  if  the  total  bundle  weight  exceeds  12,000  lbs.    Non-CVR  sticks  may  be offloaded if the total weight is less than 12,000 lbs.  Without the CVR, if the total weight of the  bundles  exceeds  12,000  lbs  bundles  should  be  restrained  in  groups  of  four  or  less  and offloaded  one  group  at  a  time.    For  the  unplanned  combat  offload  of  non-CVR  bundles, restrain  the  bundles  as  described  above.    Perform  an  initial  offload  via  the  static  line retriever,  and  on  sequential  offload,  remove  aft  restraint  before  clearing  the  pilot  to  taxi.  Consider the slope of the offload site which may  cause bundles to  roll aft upon removal of restraint. 14.16.8.  Combat Offload Method B.  Use this method to offload married pallets that do not fit the category for Method A or for which no ballast is available for married pallets weighing between 12,000 to 15,000 lbs.  Use four serviceable steel 55-gallon drums under each pallet to be offloaded.  The correct number of steel drums needed to complete this type of offload must  be  available  at  the  offload  site  or  must  accompany  the  load  when  conditions  at  the offload  site  are  unknown.  WARNING:    The  maximum  weight  for  pallets  to  be  offloaded across the ramp at any one time when using Method B is 15,000 lbs.  Do not use Method B for airdrop-rigged platforms to prevent binding the platform under the vertical restraint rails. 14.16.9.  Passenger Combat Loading.  Additional procedures are located in AFTTP 3-3.HC-130.  Floor loading is authorized to support dedicated forces and foreign counterparts during operations,  exercises,  and  training.    Standard  seating  configurations  listed  in  AFI  11-2HC-130JV3,  Addenda  A,  HC-130J  Configuration/Mission  Planning,  are  recommended,  if practical. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 163 14.17.  Infiltration/Exfiltration.  Infil/Exfils  are  a tactical  method of on-loading or off-loading dedicated  unconventional  and  CSAR/PR  Forces.  The  spring-loaded,  latch-activated,  folding ramps  (canary  slides),  or  ground  loading  ramps  are  used  to  off-load  and  on-load  vehicles, personnel, and H-6 series helicopters in minimal time. The selection of the onload/off-load point and  aircraft  orientation  impacts  total  ground  times.  Extensive  pre-mission  planning/static  load training may be necessary for large or complex loads. 14.17.1.  Egress and Static Load Training. Conduct static load training prior to all Infil/Exfil operations.    EXEPTION:    For  unilateral  Infil/Exfil  training  conducted  with  home-station assigned units using  ATV, Quads, Polaris,  and  Gator type vehicles, the  OG/CC may  waive this requirement. 14.17.2.  The loadmaster wears NVGs during blacked-out Infil/Exfil operations. 14.17.3.  LMs wear NVGs on aircraft with NVG-compatible lighting; however, they may be raised when NVG lighting is illuminated. 14.17.4.  Use  the  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  to  amplify  flight  manual  procedures  and  guidance found in this instruction. 14.17.5.  When the CSO calls 100 ft, the loadmaster notifies the onboard user, "Prepare To Land". 14.17.6.  After Touchdown. 14.17.7.  During  the  initial  Infil/Exfil  brief,  the  pilot  may  prebrief  the  opening  of  the  ramp and door upon reversing of the  engines. When there is  a delay in  the off-load/onload or  an extended  ground  time  is  anticipated,  raise  the  ramp  approximately  12  inches  above  the ground so the aircraft can taxi in the event of an emergency. Refer to Infil/Exfil Procedures. 14.18.  Off-Load Operations. 14.18.1.  Vehicles will be backed onto the aircraft. Park vehicles in lowest gear (neutral for diesel powered). Put automatic vehicles in park. 14.18.2.  Loadmasters  pass  time  warnings/advisories  to  the  troop  commander/Departure Airfield Controlling Officer (DACO). 14.18.3.  All personnel prepare for landing at the 6-minute advisory. 14.18.4.  A loadmaster remains on headset at all times (normally the left side loadmaster). 14.18.5.  Loadmasters use NVGs for all infil/exfil operations. 14.18.6.  Cargo  compartment  Electroluminescent  (EL)/NVG  lighting  is  adjusted  to  the minimum  setting  necessary  at  the  6-minute  advisory.  Aircraft  not  equipped  with  EL/NVG lighting turn the red lights off at the 6-minute advisory. Do not turn off/readjust lights until the troop commander/DACO confirms  checks are complete.  NOTE:  EL/NVG lighting may be adjusted to minimum setting prior to the 6-minute advisory, provided the user is notified. 14.18.7.  User  personnel  initiate  their  “80-knot”  procedures  upon  hearing  the  “80-KNOT” call or when the aircraft ramp and door start to open. 14.18.8.  All  restraint  devices  except  one  forward  and  one  aft  (opposite  corners)  may  be removed  during  taxi  to  the  off-load  point  (one  strap  over  seat  for  motorcycles,  quads  and 164 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 mini-bikes  will  remain  installed).  Self-propelled  vehicles  must  have  drivers  in  place  with brakes  set  prior  to  removing  restraints.  EXCEPTION:  All  restraints  remain  on  helicopters except for the tail boom until the aircraft has come to a complete stop. 14.18.9.  LMs will not position the cargo ramp below horizontal until the aircraft comes to a complete  stop  at  the  off-load  point.  (T-2).    For  areas  where  ground  threats  or  mission requirements  dictate  minimum  time  on  the  ground,  the  loadmaster  and  the  PIC  will  brief  a countdown for movement of the ramp below horizontal. (T-2).  Caution must be exercised to ensure the ramp does not contact the ground before the aircraft stops. 14.18.10.  Do  not  deploy  canary  slides/ground  loading  ramps  until  the  ramp  is  positioned below horizontal and the aircraft has stopped. 14.18.11.  Clearance  to  off-load:  A  loadmaster  is  positioned  on  the  vehicle  driver’s  side  of the cargo ramp and raise both arms to signal clearance to off-load. The loadmaster drops both arms to signal vehicle drivers to halt off-load operations. 14.18.12.  Off-load vehicles and personnel as trained during statics. 14.18.13.  Clear  a  stalled  vehicle  immediately  to  the  aircraft  right  (engines  3  and  4)  or  as static  trained  to  allow  the  off-load  to  continue.  NOTE:    If  a  time  delay  occurs  before onloading/departure,  turn  off  all  EL/NVG  lighting  and  raise  the  ramp  approximately  12 inches to allow the aircraft to be taxied in the event of an emergency. 14.19.  Onload Operations. 14.19.1.  A loadmaster will remain on headset at all times (normally the left side loadmaster). (T-2). 14.19.2.  Use NVGs for Infil/Exfil operations. 14.19.3.  Adjust EL/NVG lighting as necessary for the on-load. 14.19.4.  A loadmaster will be positioned on the vehicle driver’s side of the cargo ramp. (T-2).  Advise troop commander/DACO  will  not  clear  personnel  or  vehicles  to  load  until  cleared  by  the loadmaster. (T-2). troop  commander/DACO  when ready the for loading.  The 14.19.5.  A  loadmaster  will  be  in  the  cargo  compartment  to  marshal  vehicles  into  position with IR chem-lights. (T-2). 14.19.6.  Load vehicles and personnel as trained during statics. 14.19.7.  Coordinate  with  the  troop  commander/DACO  to  confirm  all  personnel  and equipment are onboard and the onload is complete. 14.19.8.  When  the  loadmaster  has  determined  sufficient  restraint  has  been  applied  to  the load, (minimum of one forward and one aft) and it is safe to do so, the loadmaster will advise the  crew  “CLEAR  TO  TAXI.”  Once  the  ramp  and  door  are  closed  and  locked,  the  cargo compartment EL/NVG lights may be turned to the maximum setting (if necessary). After all cargo and personnel restraint is checked, the loadmaster will advise the crew “SECURE”. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 165 Chapter 15 COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES 15.1.  General.

In-flight  Requirements.    When  NVG  use  is  required,  the  pilots,  CSO,  LMs,  and scanners  should  wear  them  or  have  them  immediately  available  based  on  mission requirements.  WARNING:    NVGs  and  associated  components  (battery  cords,  safety  cords, and other hardware) can become entangled with the fire handles, overhead panel switches, or other controls.  Any interference can cause inadvertent engine shutdown, or repositioning of other critical switches or controls. 16.9.  Minimum  Operating  Equipment  Requirements.  The AC will ensure compliance with the minimum operating equipment required for tactical employment contained in Table 16.2. (T-2).    Aircrew  experience  level  and  mission  factors  may  dictate  greater  equipment  requirements than those listed. Table 16.2.  Minimum Operating Equipment Requirements.

Mission  Planning.  Refer  to  AFTTP  3-1/3.HC-130  for  in-depth  mission  planning  and employment  considerations.    For  complex  missions,  a  minimum  of  one  full  day  should  be allocated for mission planning. 16.10.1.  Enroute  Planning.    Crews  should  fly  tactical  missions  at  the  highest  altitude commensurate with the threat(s) environment.  NOTE:   Crews will conduct a daylight route survey for all unpublished training routes prior to NVG/IMC operations. 16.10.1.1.  When  possible,  plan  the  leg  course  prior  to  the  IP  or  ARIP,  to  be  within  30 degrees of the run-in or AR track course. 16.10.1.2.  During  contingency  or  combat  operations,  executing  portions  of  planned flights  in  IMC  may  be  necessary  to  accomplish  mission  objectives;  however,  due  to aircraft  equipment  limitations,  operational  employment  in  a  low  level  environment should be considered a last resort.  The pilots and CSO consider the terrain, accuracy of the altimeter setting, and increased mid-air collision potential prior to IMC profiles being attempted. 16.10.2.  NVG Low Level Specific Requirements. 16.10.2.1.  Lunar  Illumination  Criteria.    There  is  no  minimum  illumination  requirement to  conduct  NVG  modified  contour  low  level  operations.  Aircrews  will  use  10  percent  effective illumination as a standard for low illumination. (T-2).  When below 10 percent effective  illumination  risk  mitigation  procedures  will  be  identified  and  briefed.  (T-2).  This  may  require  changing  profile,  airspeeds,  or  altitudes  among  many  other  options.    NOTE:    Lack  of  sufficient  illumination  may  prevent  NVG  contour  operations  in otherwise VMC conditions. 16.10.2.2.  NVG  Altitudes  and  Start  Climb  Points  (SCPs).    The  CSO/P  will  compute NVG  altitudes  and  SCPs  for  all  NVG  low  level  routes  and  CSO/P  will  brief  the  SCPs during  route  study.  (T-2).    See  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  for  addition  information  on  NVG Altitudes. 16.10.2.2.1.  NVG Altitudes. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 16.10.2.2.2.  SCPs.    Refer  to  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130.  Calculate  SCPs  IAW  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 173 16.10.3.  Fuel Planning.  For tactical low level operations, assume a 5,000 lbs per hour fuel burnoff rate unless more accurate data is available. 16.10.4.  Threat Analysis.  Refer to AFTTP 3-1.1 and AFTTP 3-1.2 for in-depth information of threat system capabilities and limitations, as well as threat employment techniques. 16.11.  Low Level. 16.11.1.  Briefing  Requirements.  Conduct  aircrew  briefings  IAW  paragraph  6.14  of  this instruction and the guidance below: 16.11.1.1.  During the mission crew briefing, the PIC will brief all applicable items from the PIC’s briefing guide located in AFI 11-2HC-130JV3 CL-1. (T-2). 16.11.1.2.  Tactical  Briefings.  The  PIC  must  ensure  all  tactical  sorties  include  a  route  brief and tactical briefing. (T-2).  The CSO will brief all applicable items from the CSO’s briefing guide located in AFI 11-2HC-130JV3 CL-1. (T-2).  All pilots and CSO are required to attend the tactical route brief and briefing. (T-3). 16.12.  Chart  Requirements.  Print  the  planned  low  level  routes  on  a  1:500,000  (TPC  or Sectional)  or  larger  scale  chart,  if  required.  Use  a  1:250,000  (JOG)  or  larger  scale  chart  for overland  threat  penetration  operations,  mountainous  NVG  low-level  operations,  and  the objective  areas,  unless  not  available,  or  of  an  inferior  quality  to  a  TPC.  MAJCOM  approved MPE  may  be  used  to  calculate  all  terrain  clearance  altitudes.  Crews  should  verify  all  altitudes using chart elevations. WARNING:  Aeronautical charts do not depict man-made obstacles less than  200  ft  AGL  or  a  change  in  terrain  until  it  exceeds  the  chart  contour  interval.    The  worst situation would occur if a 199 ft tower sat on terrain with an elevation just below the next higher contour.    For  a  1:500,000  (TPC)  with  a  contour  interval  of  500  ft,  this  would  result  in  an uncharted obstacle existing 698 ft above charted terrain.  Additionally, the highest spot elevation on  any  given  leg  may  not  be  the  highest  terrain  as  in  the  case  of  gradually  rising  elevations.    NOTE: Whenever available (e.g., in most instances) Level II or greater DTED should be utilized when determining controlling obstacle elevations.  Likewise, selection of VVOD overlay should not implement option to hide towers when determining controlling obstacles.    NOTE:  For local training routes, if a mountainous NVG route has been planned using a JOG and elevations and altitudes are verified, the route may be flown with reference to a TPC. 16.12.1.  Minimum Hardcopy Chart Requirements for Mission Planning and Flight. 16.12.1.1.  The CSO will carry a hardcopy chart (or set of charts as required) that covers all  enroute  and  objective  mission  areas.  NOTE:  Aircraft  modified  with  approved  Pilot tablets and CSO laptops can utilize that equipment in lieu of a hardcopy chart. 16.12.1.2.  The pilot and copilot may share a single low level/objective area chart during flight.    If  this  option  is  used,  both  the  pilot  and  copilot  must  participate  in  pre-mission route  analysis  using  the  single  chart(s).  NOTE:  Aircraft  modified  with  approved  Pilot tablets and CSO laptops can utilize that equipment in lieu of a hardcopy chart. 16.12.1.3.  DTD ID should match chart turnpoint labels and CNI-MU waypoint labels to aid in crew coordination. 174 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 Table 16.3.  Chart Symbology Requirements.

If planned route is different than course line, draw deviation lines. Annotate magnetic heading  information near these deviation lines (if desired) to aid in dead reckoning during significant  turns. 2. Place a box around the obstacle or terrain that defines the MSA for each leg. 3. Place the ESA in bold numbers on the chart. When multiple ESAs are used, or when using  strip charts, annotate ESA on each chart segment. Place a double box around the obstacle or  terrain that defines each ESA. 4. If the leg is split between two charts, place a Course Arrow Box on both charts. 5. Required for NVG low-level operations. Clearly identify the controlling obstacle on the charts. Place SCPs and associated NVG altitude at the  required distance to go where the start climb (S/C) is to be initiated.  Annotate as follows: ―S/C  17/12/3500‖ or ―S/C 17/3500/12‖ or ―S/C 3500/17/12.‖ Example indicates a S/C to 3500‘ MSL NVG altitude, started at 17 NMs to go and at NVG altitude by 12 NM to go.  6. Calculate IMC airdrop SDPs IAW AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 IFR Drop Corridor procedures. 16.13.  Minimum IFR Enroute Altitude. 16.13.1.  Minimum  IFR  enroute  altitude  is  IAW  AFI  11-202V3  as  supplemented.    EXCEPTION:    For  contingency  operations,  compute  minimum  IFR  enroute  altitude  by adding  1,000  ft  (2,000  ft  in  mountainous  terrain)  to  the  highest  obstacle  or  terrain  feature within 5 NM either side of route centerline, and rounded up to the next 100-ft increment.  For routes  where  the  terrain  varies  significantly,  crews  may  establish  a  separate  minimum  IFR enroute altitude for route segments with similar terrain or obstacle elevations. 16.13.2.  Descent  below  IFR  minimum  altitudes,  listed  above,  is  only  allowable  under  the following conditions: 16.13.2.1.  Intercepting glideslope for an approved IMC SCA. 16.13.2.2.  Reaching the Drop Zone Entry Point for IMC airdrop. 16.13.2.3.  Established on an ATC provided minimum  radar vectoring altitude available from a suitably equipped and capable radar facility. 16.13.2.4.  Established  on  a  published  IFR  route  or  instrument  approach  procedure compatible with aircraft navigation systems. 16.13.2.5.  IMC descent to VFR. 16.14.  Low  Level  Operations.  VFR  tactical  operations  conducted  below  3,000  ft  AGL  are considered low level operations. 16.14.1.  AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 augments procedures in this instruction. 16.14.2.  ACs will comply with the minimum operating equipment requirements IAW Table 16.1. (T-2). 176 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 nation ICAO/host requirements 16.14.3.  Weather  Minimums.    Conduct  modified  contour  low  level  operations  in  VMC.    NOTE:  This does not preclude the pilot from VFR filing requirements in AFI 11-202V3 or applicable WARNING:  Operating under VFR clearance in IMC conditions is normally an emergency procedure during training or exercise operations, requiring appropriate IFF and radio calls to the area air traffic control agency.  During contingency or combat operations, flying portions of planned flights in IMC may be necessary to accomplish mission objectives; however, due to aircraft equipment limitations, operational employment in a low level environment should be considered a last resort.  The pilots and CSO consider the terrain, accuracy of the altimeter setting, and increased mid-air potential prior to IMC profiles being attempted. if operating outside  CONUS.               16.14.4.  Low Level Altitudes. 16.14.4.1.  Lowest  Acceptable  Altitude  (LAA).    During  training  operations,  higher weather  or  altitude  minimums  may  be  dictated  by  FLIP,  ICAO  procedures,  training considerations,  or  crew  experience.    LAAs  allowed  for  enroute  modified  contour  low level operations are: 16.14.4.1.1.  Day  VMC  LAA.    LAA  is  300  ft  AGL  modified  contour  above  the terrain  (except  when  using  Threat  Penetration  Altitude),  by  visual  reference  to  both the terrain and radar altimeter.  Momentary terrain clearance deviations are expected and allowed due to terrain variance; however, avoid sustained deviations below LAA. 16.14.4.1.2.  Night VMC (Non-NVG) LAA.  LAA is MSA.  When the altitude for the next  leg  or  segment  is  higher  than  the  altitude  currently  being  flown,  complete  the climb prior to the turn point or segment.  When the altitude for the next leg segment is lower than the current altitude, do not initiate descent until established on the new leg or  segment.    EXCEPTION:    During  terminal  area  operations  (airdrops  and approaches), do not descend from enroute altitude until the objective is identified and adequate terrain clearance is assured. 16.14.4.1.3.  IMC LAA.  LAA is MSA.  When the altitude for the next leg or segment is higher than the altitude currently being flown, complete the climb prior to the turn point or segment.  When the altitude for the next leg segment is lower than the current altitude, do not initiate descent until established on the new leg or segment.   NOTE:  During  training,  conduct  planned  IMC  routes  under  instrument  flight  rules  (IFR) unless FLIP, ICAO, or host nation rules define other procedures. 16.14.4.1.4.  NVG  LAA.    LAA  is  500  ft  AGL  modified  contour  above  the  terrain (except  when  using  Threat  Penetration  Altitude),  by  visual  reference  to  both  the terrain  and  radar  altimeter.    (T-2)  Momentary  terrain  clearance  deviations  are expected  and  allowed  due  to  terrain  variance;  however,  crews  must  avoid  sustained deviations below LAA. 16.14.4.1.5.  Threat  Penetration  (TP)  LAA.    LAA  is  200  ft  AGL  for  day  VMC operations  and  300  ft  AGL  for  NVG  operations  for  training  operations.    During contingency and/or combat operations TP LAA is no lower than 100 ft AGL. 16.14.4.1.5.1.  During combat operations, limit the time spent at TP altitude to the duration needed to avoid/negate the specific threat. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 177 16.14.4.1.5.2.  During  training  operations,  fly  TP  altitudes  with  the  following restrictions: 16.14.4.1.5.2.1.  A mission IP must be in either seat. (T-2). 16.14.4.1.5.2.2.  Not authorized on unfamiliar routes. 16.14.4.1.5.2.3.  Pre-planned  and  restricted  to  flat/rolling  terrain  and  coastal penetrations. 16.14.4.1.5.2.4.  Prior to intiating a “Break” or “Hard Turn”, crews will climb to  300  ft  AGL.  (T-2).    No  simulated  emergencies  allowed.  WARNING:  Severely restrict bank angles below 200 ft AGL.  Due to the close proximity to  the  ground,  aircrews  must  be  cautious  of  any  descending  vector  that  may develop during TP operations. 16.14.4.2.  Climb to MSA when either pilot must leave the seat during low level flight. 16.14.5.  NVG  Enroute  and  Objective  Area  Navigation.    Obstacle  avoidance  at  night  is accomplished  using  NVGs,  LPCR,  EO-IR,  and  radar  altimeter  along  with  flying  NVG altitudes  as  necessary  to  maintain  terrain  clearance.    Higher  altitudes  up  to  MSA  may  be required.    WARNING:  NVG low level flight and low illumination air refueling increase the chance crewmembers can experience spatial disorientation. 16.14.5.1.  Crews should set the cross track limit during enroute ops to alert them when close  to  maneuvering  outside  of  the  current  MSA  corridor.  (i.e.  set  to  2.5  nm  to  notify crew  they  are  approaching  the  limits  of  their  cooridor).    Calculate  a  new  MSA  if maneuvering outside of preplanned MSA cooridor. 16.15.  Low  Level  Emergency  Procedures  .    The  procedures  listed  below  apply  to  both training  and  contingency  operations.      EXCEPTION:    During  combat  operations,  a  climb  to MSA/ESA  may  expose  the  aircraft  to  greater  hazard  due  to  enemy  threat  detection.    The  PIC may  climb  to  a  Detection  Free  Altitude  (DFA)  or  intermediate  altitude  during  a  low  level emergency.  Base the decision to use this lower altitude after a thorough pre-mission assessment of the enemy’s overall threat detection capability and nature of the emergency. 16.15.1.  Crew  Disorientation.    When  a  crew  becomes  disoriented  on  a  low  level  mission, start a climb to ESA.  Continue the climb until ESA is reached or a positive fix is obtained.  After  obtaining  a  positive  fix,  descend  and  resume  low  level  operations.  The  CSO/PM crosschecks timing and adjusts as necessary. 16.15.2.  Spatial Disorientation or NVG Malfunction. The PM will be ready to immediately take control of the aircraft if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or NVG malfunction. (T-2). 16.15.2.1.  If  either  pilot  experiences  spatial  disorientation  or  NVG  malfunction,  start  a climb to at least MSA until the pilot experiencing the problem is ready to resume PM or PF duties.  Continue low level operations at PICs discretion. 16.15.2.2.  During NVG takeoff or landing, the PM must react quickly to assume control and  execute  the  appropriate  action,  regardless  of  qualification  or  pilot  position.  (T-2).  The CP must be ready to turn on overt landing and taxi lights to assist in the maneuver. (T-2). 178 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 16.15.3.  Inadvertent  Weather  Penetration.    Climb  to  MSA  if  unable  to  avoid  flight  into weather conditions that prohibit VMC operations.  A further climb to ESA may be required.  After VMC is reestablished, continue low level operations at PICs discretion. 16.15.4.  Aircraft  System  Failure.    Start  a  climb  to  MSA  when  a  known  or  suspected malfunction  prevents  continued  safe  low  level  operations.    Maintain  at  least  MSA  until completion  of  troubleshooting.    If  the  aircraft  meets  minimum  operating  equipment requirements IAW Chapter 4 and Table 16.1, the crew may continue low level operations at PICs discretion.  Aircraft not meeting requirements will fly at MSA or higher. (T-2). 16.15.5.  Emergency Climb.  The decision to execute an emergency climb should be made as soon as possible.  The procedure should be considered in cases of, but not limited to, certain equipment  malfunctions,  spatial  disorientation,  inadvertent  weather  penetration,  loss  of situational awareness, and imminent contact with the terrain.  Any crewmember may initiate an emergency climb by stating “EMERGENCY CLIMB.” 16.15.5.1.  Emergency  Climb  Procedure.  Execute  “TAWS  TACTICAL  MODE  PULL UP RECOVERY” procedure from the T.O. 1C-130(H)J-1. 16.16.  Barometric  Altimeter  Settings.  Barometric  altimeter  updates  will  be  performed  IAW AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 16.16.1.  An  ALT  UPDATE  derived  aircraft  altimeter  setting  should  only  be  used  outside ATC controlled environments.  An ALT UPDATE should be performed prior to all airdrops or landings.  Obtain an ALT UPDATE as close to the objective area and as near the objective altitude as possible.  Use sound judgment  when  updating aircraft altimeters and  crosscheck elevations and new settings with all available information. 16.16.1.1.  If  a  valid  GPS  position  is  available  (FOM  2  or  better),  the  PM  updates  the aircraft altimeter setting to equal the GPS altitude once established on drop altitude (for airdrops)  or  final  ingress  altitude  (for  SCAs).    For  SCA  ingress  altitudes  greater  than 1000 ft above threshold elevation, use the lowest forecast altimeter setting. 16.16.1.2.  If a valid GPS altitude is unavailable (FOM 3 or greater), the CSO updates the pressure altimeter by recording the current altimeter setting, AGL altitude from the radar altimeter, and the MSL altitude from  the pressure altimeter over a known elevation and computing  a  new  setting  or  use  the  minimum  altimeter  setting  for  the  objective  area.  This  works  well  when  flying  over  a  body  of  water,  or  flat  terrain.    Ensure  the  radar altimeter is  fully operational  and use sound judgment when updating aircraft altimeters.   WARNING:  Obtaining an ALT UPDATE at a significantly higher or lower altitude than the target can induce substantial altimeter error.  Use extreme caution when updating the pressure altimeter to a higher setting, as lower absolute altitudes will result. 16.16.2.  Cold  Weather  Altimeter  Corrections.  Apply  cold  weather  altimeter  corrections  to any  non-GPS  derived  barometric  altitude  (MSA,  ESA,  NVG  altitude,  drop  altitude,  SCA backup  altitudes,  SCA  minimums,  etc.),  used  during  low-level  operations  when  the  outside air temperature is below 32F/0C. 16.17.  Radar Altimeter Settings. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 179 16.17.1.  Low  Level  Settings.    Set  radar  altimeters  no  lower  than  20%  below  minimum enroute altitude (i.e. minimum setting of 400 ft for 500 ft NVG modified contour and 160 ft for day TP altitude at 200 ft). 16.17.2.  The  PF  will  make  an  immediate  correction  any  time  the  system  provides  an “Altitude-Altitude”  annunciation.  (T-2).    NOTE:    Regardless  of  the  radar  altimeter  setting used, the PF will not wait for an annunciation to begin a correction to altitude. (T-2). 16.18.  Use of TCAS During Tactical Operations. 16.18.1.  TCAS. 16.18.1.1.  Crews may operate TCAS in TA-only mode during low level operations. 16.18.1.2.  Operate TCAS in TA-only mode during HAAR, and AAR operations. 180 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 Chapter 17 TERMINAL AREA OPERATIONS 17.1.  General.  This  chapter  provides  procedures,  requirements,  and  restrictions  for  HC-130J terminal area operations.  Additional TTPs required by crews in the tactical execution of PR are contained  in  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  and  other  tactics  manuals.    In  the  case  of  conflict,  the information in this instruction takes precedence. 17.2.  Infil/Exfil Operations. 17.2.1.  Aircraft Preparation. 17.2.1.1.  Chemical lights. As required. 17.2.2.  Approach to LZ. 17.2.2.1.  Minimum  Operating  Equipment  Requirements.    See  Table  16.2  for  any restrictions for the approach type being flown to an LZ. 17.2.2.2.  NVG  Batteries.  Each  pilot  will  silently  check  both  NVG  batteries  are operational during the INFIL/EXFIL checklist. (T-2). 17.2.2.3.  Barometric Altimeter Setting. Determine the most accurate altimeter setting for the LZ using all available sources. 17.2.2.4.  Radar Altimeters.  Radar altimeters should be set to 50 feet AGL below HAT. 17.2.3.  Descent.  Do not descend below MDA AGL until both pilots visually identify the LZ environment. Whoever identifies the LZ first calls out "zone in sight,” its clock position, and any discrepancies (i.e., any lights out, etc.)  Both pilots then confirm the zone and crosscheck the alignment for proper heading.    WARNING:  Do not initiate a descent below 300 ft AGL prior to 2 NM to touchdown.  This causes the glideslope to be excessively shallow. 17.2.3.1.  Landing lights.  Depending on the type of landing, the pilot selects either overt or covert lighting. If the PF requires lights to acquire the LZ, call for “taxi lights,” the PM then  turns  on  the  taxi  lights.    If  the  PF  requires  additional  lights  they  call  for  “landing lights,”  the  PM  then  turns  on  both  the  taxi  and  landing  lights.  NOTE:  Setting  covert lighting  will  change  all  lights,  including  navigation  and  position  lights,  to  covert.    This should be accomplished IAW FAA or host nation aviation regulations. 17.2.3.1.1.  Aircraft lighting is as briefed/directed by ground parties for authentication purposes.  Aircrews will be thoroughly briefed on the use of covert lighting in respect to the threat, runway environment, and authentication procedures.  (T-2). 17.2.3.2.  The CSO will call 2 miles, 1 mile, 100, 50, 25 and 10 ft above touchdown or as briefed. (T-2). 17.2.4.  Go-Around  and  Departure  Procedures.    Identify  a  go-around  point  during  pre-mission planning for all NVG airland operations. When executing a go-around or departure, the  CSO  will  call  out  passing  through  100,  200,  and  300  ft  AGL.  (T-2).  Whether maneuvering  for  another  approach  or  proceeding  with  the  route,  plan  to  fly  no  lower  than enroute  LAA  unless  operational  requirements  dictate  other  altitudes.    During  a  go-around, AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 181 initiate  the  GO  AROUND  Procedure.    WARNING:    Pilots  are  more  susceptible  to  spatial disorientation during NVG go-arounds and departures. 17.2.4.1.  Immediate Landing Feasible.  If an immediate visual approach and landing are feasible,  clear  vigilantly  for  obstacles.    Maneuver  the  aircraft  to  be  500  ft  AGL  wings level and configured at approximately a 2 NM final. The PF should keep the landing zone insight during this maneuver to the maximum extent possible. 17.2.4.2.  Immediate  Landing  Not  Feasible.    If  an  immediate  approach  and  landing  are not  feasible, maneuver the aircraft to  the  IP or next  waypoint at or  above enroute  LAA unless  operational  requirements  dictate  other  altitudes.    When  an  immediate  landing  is not  feasible,  execute  the  AFTER  TAKEOFF  checklist  after  the  completion  of  the  GO AROUND Procedure. 17.2.5.  Ground Operations. 17.2.5.1.  The  copilot  and  CSO  will  assist  the  pilot  in  locating  the  offload/onload  site once taxi speed is reached and aid in clearing for other aircraft and obstructions. (T-2). 17.2.5.2.  Use  IR  taxi  and  landing  lights  to  the  minimum  extent  required  to  maintain visual references during taxi operations and takeoff roll.  Interior lighting is the same as for the approach and landing. 17.2.6.  Overt  Landings  Following  NVG  Landings.    If  the  sortie  continues  with  Non-NVG VFR  traffic  patterns,  accomplish  either  the  COMBAT  EXIT  and  TOUCH  AND  GO LANDING  checklists  or  the  INFIL/EXFIL  OPTION  LANDING  checklist.    If  only  a  few patterns are planned, the INFIL/EXFIL OPTION LANDING checklist is quicker and easier to  use.    If many patterns or instrument work is  planned, the COMBAT EXIT and TOUCH AND GO LANDING checklists are appropriate. 17.2.7.  Infil/Exfil  Option  Landing  Procedures.    Fly  a  normal  visual  pattern.  Pilots  will  call “zone in sight” as they turn final and the CSO will make standard altitude advisory calls on descent. (T-2). 17.2.8.  Loss of NVGs. 17.2.8.1.  Before  Landing.    If  the  PF  or  PM  loses  use  of  their  NVGs  inside  of  1  NM, perform a go-around. 17.2.8.2.  After  Takeoff.    Transfer  aircraft  control  and  continue  the  climb  to  enroute altitude or MSA as appropriate. 17.2.8.3.  On the Ground. The PF determines whether to  continue the landing rollout or takeoff  roll  as  applicable.    The  PM  should  be  prepared  to  turn  on  overt  lighting  at  the direction of the PF in case of NVG failure during takeoff or landing roll. 17.2.8.4.  AMAX/Max Effort T/O.  Set 150’ in the RADAR Altimeter for AMAX/Max Effort initial T/Os and subsequent T/Os from stop and go operations so you are >66% of the  RADAR  Altimeter  setting  when  the  gear  is  fully  retracted.  This  will  prevent triggering a GCAS alert as described in TO 1C-130(H)J-1; pg 18B-11. 17.3.  Self-Contained  Approach  (SCA).  SCA  procedures  may  be  used  for  approaches  to conventional  airfields  and  assault  zones,  and  for  either  overt  or  NVG  airland  operations.  Conduct  SCAs  using  the  tactical  INFIL/EXFIL  checklist  procedures  or  from  the  normal 182 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 APPROACH  and  BEFORE  LANDING  checklists.    SCAs  may  be  accomplished  using  IPRA procedures or LZ procedures. Comply with local ATC restrictions and host nation agreements, as appropriate. 17.3.1.  Weather Minimums: 17.3.1.1.  Aircrews will conduct Non-IMC approved SCAs in VMC only. (T-2). 17.3.1.2.  Aircrews  must  ensure  IMC  SCA  weather  minimums  are  IAW  the  published procedure, but no lower than 300-1. (T-2). 17.3.1.3.  Fly IMC SCAs IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 3 and the following guidance: 17.3.1.3.1.  To  provide  an  early  indication  of  degraded  navigation  accuracy,  set  the POS ALERT(s) at 0.03 NM (55 yards; FOM 2) and 0.05 NM (110 yards; FOM 4). 17.3.1.3.2.  For any SCA, verify navigation accuracy  within 10 minutes of the FAF. Do not descend from FAF altitude without verifying the active ship solution if any of the  following  conditions  exists:  either  FOM  greater  than  4,  INAV  Pos  Miscompare ACAWS, or INAV Pos Difference ACAWS. 17.3.1.4.  Both  pilots  or  a  pilot  and  CSO  will  verify  runway  point  of  intercept  (RPI)  or LZ coordinates in the mission computer. (T-2). Verify the CNI-MU LZ information with a valid LZ survey or DAFIF. 17.3.2.  Minimum Operating Equipment Requirements.  See Table 16.2. 17.3.3.  Pre-mission Requirements. 17.3.3.1.  SCA  Construction.    Construct  SCAs  IAW  the  guidance  found  in  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130. 17.3.3.1.1.  Chart Scale.  Use the largest scale chart available from 10 NM inbound.  A 1:50,000 chart is preferred, but in no case can it be smaller than 1:250,000. 17.3.3.1.2.  The  CSO/pilot  will  construct  an  approach  plate  for  the  SCA  using  a computer Approach Planning Tool (APT), the AF Form 4118,  SCA Planning Form, or an OGV approved planning form. (T-2). 17.3.3.2.  Plan  a  minimum  of  a  7  NM  straight-in  approach  for  VMC/IMC  SCAs  unless the order of battle or terrain prohibits it.  Plan and execute turning SCAs, dogleg SCAs, etc. IAW AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 17.3.3.3.  Plan  to  intercept  a  3  degree  glideslope  from  enroute  altitude  unless  terrain  or obstructions  dictate  a  different  glideslope.    Avoid  using  glideslopes  greater  than  5 degrees. 17.3.4.  Missed Approach Point (MAP).  The MAP is at zero distance to  go on the mission computer or as required on the SCA plate at MDA. 17.3.5.  Approach Execution: 17.3.5.1.  General.  The CSO will make 30 seconds to slowdown, slowdown, 2 mile and 1 mile calls. (T-2). 17.3.5.2.  Inbound  to  LZ.    Maintain  enroute  profile  until  descent  to  MDA.    Initiate slowdown  at  the  point  identified  during  mission  planning.    Slow  the  aircraft  to  no  less AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 183 than  50  percent  threshold  speed,  configure  the  flaps  and  gear  as  airspeed  permits.    Call for  100%  flaps  as  airspeed  permits.    Confirm  100%  flaps  are  set  prior  to  reaching threshold speed.  NOTE:  The EO-IR is helpful in LZ identification and should be used to  scan  the  LZ  for  obstructions,  but  it  is  not  intended  to  be  used  to  fly  the  entire  SCA.   WARNING:  Do not slow to threshold speed until established on final for both straight-in and turning SCAs. 17.3.5.3.  Descent.  At  descent  point,  the  CSO  states  "begin  descent,"  and  repeat  the desired  FPA,  then  provide  glide-path  advisories  as  necessary.  The  CSO/PM  provides glideslope/horizontal  advisories  with  reference  to  the  mission  computer,  pressure altimeter,  and  radar  altimeter.    These  calls  are  made  at  1/2  NM  intervals  until  reaching the "100 feet" call or as briefed.  The CSO relays altitude deviations in actual feet above or  below  glideslope  (ex.  “15  feet  above  glideslope.”)  to  the  crew.  The  CSO  relays deviations in excess of 150 ft explicitly to the crew.  CSO may omit altitude calls, except deviations  of  more  than  150  feet  during  IPRAs.  The  CSO  also  advises  the  PF  if  the aircraft  is  correcting  to  or  diverging  from  glideslope,  using  the  term  "Rapidly,"  if appropriate. The PM and CSO will closely monitor radar altimeters to ensure accuracy of altimeter settings to prevent inadvertently flying below planned AGL minimums.  (T-2).  WARNING:  Use of a 5 degree glideslope can cause descent rates in excess of 1,500 ft per  minute.    Pilots  need  to  take  extreme  care  to  break  high  descent  rates  prior  to touchdown. 17.4.  Tactical  Approaches.  Aircrews  will  conduct  tactical  approaches  (overhead,  downwind, random  steep,  SCA,  and  random  shallow)  IAW  the  airland  operation  procedures  found  in AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. (T-2). 17.4.1.  NVG Tactical Approaches.  Certified pilots may conduct NVG tactical approaches to AMP 1, 2, 3 or 4 marked landing zones. 17.4.2.  When  performing  tactical  approaches,  adhere  to  flight  manual  maneuvering  and configuration restrictions. 184 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 Chapter 18 AIRDROP OPERATIONS 18.1.  General.  This  chapter  prescribes  HC-130J  employment  procedures  for  all  airdrop operations. For additional guidance and information, refer to AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 18.1.1.  Prior  to  takeoff,  crewmembers  will  review  the  emergency  procedures  for  the proposed  airdrop.  (T-2).    In  the  event  of  a  malfunction,  incident,  or  off-DZ  drop,  do  not execute FLIGHT COMPLETE or remove any CNI-MU data, do not de-rig, handle or move items  unless  required  for  safety  of  flight.  Any  follow-on  investigation  will  benefit  from seeing  the  items  in  the  position  or  state  they  were  in  at  the  time  of  the  event.  Drop  zone malfunctions  and  off-DZ  drops  will  be  reported  IAW  AFI  13-210  and  AFI  13-217  as supplemented. 18.2.  Specific  Airdrop  Information.  For  additional  information  about  airdrops  to  include airdrops not covered in this section see AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 18.3.  Airdrop Altitudes and Airspeeds.  Refer to AFI 11-231 for specific airdrop altitudes and airspeeds. 18.4.  Minimum Drop Zones Size.  Refer to AFI 13-217. 18.5.  Types of Drop Zones.  Refer to AFI 13-217. 18.6.  Drop Zone Markings.  Plan and coordinate DZ markings according to AFI 13-217. 18.6.1.  Water  DZs.  Water  drops  can  be  conducted  on  marked  or  unmarked  DZs.  Refer  to AFI 13-217 for further guidance. 18.7.  Airdrop  Planning/Aircraft  Airdrop  Setup.  NOTE:  Any  reference  to  CARP  applies  to both CARPs and HARPs. 18.7.1.  The  approved  ACC-approved  Mission  Planning  Environment  is  authorized  for planning  airdrop  missions.    Crews  compute  applicable  CARP(s)  and  print  out  applicable planning product for the crew brief/route study. 18.7.2.  Aircrew should use a DZ mosaic for pre-mission planning/briefing for DZ situational awareness and familiarity with CARP solution.  Mosaics are not required in-flight. 18.8.  Methods of Aerial Delivery. 18.8.1.  There are several methods of aerial delivery for the HC-130J that include: automatic release at the computer derived release point, JMD, Rescue Drops, etc. See AFTTP 3-3.HC-130  for  additional  guidance  on  methods  of  aerial  delivery.  See  paragraph  16.36  for navigation system accuracy requirements. 18.8.2.  Low Altitude Airdrop Positioning (Visual). The following are approved methods of positioning the aircraft on a final for low level visual airdrops 18.8.3.  Pilot/LM  Directed  Airdrops.  Pilot  and  LMs  may  direct  certain  specialized  rescue equipment and freefall equipment deliveries IAW this chapter and AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 18.8.4.  Ground  Marked  Release  System  (GMRS).  See  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  for  additional guidance. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 185 18.8.5.  Verbally  Initiated  Release  System  (VIRS).  See  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  for  additional guidance. 18.9.  Airdrop Restrictions. 18.9.1.  Airdrop wind limitations. Refer to AFI 13-217. 18.9.2.  DZ Surveys. The pilots and CSO will review the DZ survey during mission planning. (T-2).  Carry a valid DZ survey onboard all flights performing airdrops.  NOTE:  CSO laptop with  current  DZ  database  meets  this  requirement.    EXCEPTION:    Contingency  operations are exempt from this requirement if current DZ survey is not available. 18.9.3.  Airdrop  Communications  Procedures.  Aircrews  must  coordinate  radio  silence procedures prior to mission execution. (T-2). 18.9.4.  Minimum  Enroute  Flight  Time.  Minimum  enroute  flight  time  from  takeoff  to  time over release point,  for drops, will be sufficient  to safely  accomplish  all required  checklists. For airdrops involving personnel, enroute time of less than 20 minutes must be approved by the JM. (T-2). 18.9.5.  Ballistic  Requirements.  Crews  will  not  make  airdrops  using  parachutes  for  which AFI  11-231  does  not  list  ballistics  unless  the  user  provides  approved  ballistic  data  or  K factor.  (T-2).  HQ  ACC/A3T,  Aeronautical  Systems  Division  or  US  Army  Soldier's  System Center  Natick  (ASD/ENFC),  and/or  Special  Operations  Aerial  Delivery  Element  (SOADE) will approve the ballistics or K factor. This does not apply to formal test missions where the purpose of the test is to derive ballistic data for a specific load or operational test. 18.9.6.  Airdrop Operations. 18.9.6.1.  The  aircraft  will  not  be  configured  where  the  cargo  ramp  and  door  and  the paratroop  door(s)  are  open  at  the  same  time.  (T-2).    EXCEPTION:    Authorized  LM-directed  airdrops  of  bundles  off  the  ramp  while  spotting  from  a  single  open  paratroop door. 18.9.6.2.  If  an  air  deflector  door  cannot  be  opened,  the  LM  will  not  use  its  respective paratroop door. (T-2). 18.9.6.3.  A maximum of ten static lines may be retrieved manually per paratroop door. A maximum of 20 static lines per cable may be retrieved with a static line retriever winch. 18.10.  Airdrop Kits.  The LM will carry enough equipment in the airdrop kit to satisfy load or mission requirements. (T-3). The LM will ensure the airdrop kit includes the following minimum items: cloth-backed pressure sensitive tape, 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord, 550 cord, 5 cord, 80 lb cotton webbing, two G-14 clevises, adjustable wrench and four carabiners. (T-3). 18.11.  Joint Airdrop Inspection. 18.11.1.  Joint  Airdrop  Inspection  Records.  Unless  exempted  by  AFI  13-210,  Joint  Airdrop Inspection  Records,  Malfunction  Investigations,  and  Activity  Reporting,  MAJCOM supplements  or  waivers,  the  LM  will  accomplish  a  DD  Form  1748  prior  to  all  equipment airdrops. (T-2). The LM will complete, retain, and dispose of the form(s) in accordance with AFI 13-210, as supplemented. (T-2).    A-7A and A-21 containers rigged as door bundles do not  require a before loading or after loading inspection. The JM of the airdrop unit and the LM will perform an inspection to ensure the A-7A and A-21 containers are properly rigged 186 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 for  either  breakaway  or  nonbreakaway  (IAW  FM  3–21.220),  connection  to  aircraft equipment,  and clear route of exit.  (T-2).    NOTE:  Equipment  not  rigged  IAW 13C-series TOs,  Army  Field  Manuals,  or  Joint  Special  Operations  Command  (JSOC)  350-series manuals  require  a  waiver  from  U.S.  Army  Quartermaster,  Ft  Lee,  VA.  Channel  waiver requests  through  HQ  ACC/A3TV.  EXCEPTION:  Waivers  are  not  required  for  resupply, parabundles, and equipment described in this volume. 18.11.2.  If airdrop and airland loads are carried at the same time, the LM will comply with the restrictions listed in Table 18.1. (T-2).  These restrictions are designed to prevent airland loads from interfering with airdrop rigging equipment. Table 18.1.  Load Planning Restrictions.  1.  Retriever Winch Cable/Pulley from aircraft floor Restrictions 2. Distance between anchor cables; (a) CDS or Equipment (b) Personnel1       (1) Forward Bulkhead       (2) Intermediate Supports 3.  Airland Cargo Height 4.  Cargo locations on personnel airdrops (Static line or HALO) Minimum Distance (Inches) 84”  108”  6” Inboard, 64” Outboard 76” Inboard, 76” Outboard Cannot interfere with overhead rigging equipment CDS Only – 80” Height2 Troop Door Exit: No Cargo Between FS 657-737 5.  Passenger/Personnel distance from airdrop rigging equipment  60” 6.  Safety Aisle to rear of aircraft3 7.  Access to operate airdrop equipment All missions, alongside or over top of cargo Troop Seats not used 1L and 2L NOTES: (1) Personnel airdrops may be performed with only one troop door configured for airdrop with user concurrence.  (2) Will not exceed 80” with 12” either side of retriever cable.  Height of cargo outside of the 12” left and right (total 24”) may exceed the 80” height limitation, but will not interfere with overhead rigging equipment.  (3) CDS and heavy equipment configuration. A maximum of three rows of nylon seats may be used.  The remaining vacant row serves as a safety aisle.  All sidewall seats will be raised or stowed in the wheel well area when airland pallets and vehicles are located within this area and exceed 96” width. 18.12.  Verification Of and Marking Airdrop Loads.  The CSO/P will verify with the LM the actual number and type of parachutes, load weights, sequence of extraction, and position of loads in the aircraft agree with planned CARP data. (T-2).  If an individual load has a different type or number of parachutes from other loads, compute a CARP for each load to ensure all loads land on  the  DZ.  Base  drop  altitude  on  the  item  requiring  the  highest  drop  altitude.  For  training AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 187 missions, the LM will will coordinate with the CSO to ensure all equipment, drogues, containers, and standard airdrop training bundles are marked with  the aircraft call sign  and date.  (T-2).   If more than one load is dropped on the same pass, mark loads with order of exit from aircraft. The LM will ensure markings are placed on the extracted end of the load, and on the drogue line. (T-2). EXCEPTION: If more than one CDS bundle is dropped on the same pass, mark only the first container NOTE: Contingency loads are not be marked. 18.13.  Safety  Equipment.  During  Airdrops,  all  personnel  in  the  cargo  compartment  will  be seated with their seat belt fastened. (T-2).  Crewmembers will wear a restraint harness/parachute, helmet when performing duties near an open exit in flight.  (T-2). EXCEPTION: Helmet is not required  for  SATB/non-equipment  airdrop  operations.    WARNING:  (T-2)  Crewmembers  must wear a restraint harness when performing duties near an open exit above 14,000 ft MSL or below 800 ft AGL.      WARNING: Except for an actual contingency, towed trooper, or emergency that threatens the survivability of the aircraft and crew, the restraint harness will not be disconnected or lengthened to a point that would allow the LM to fall outside the aircraft. (T-2). 18.13.1.  When used, crewmembers will fit the restraint harness and adjust the lifeline before flight.    (T-2).      Comply  with  the  following  guidance  when  fitting/adjusting  the  lifeline (exception: inflight paratroop door usage/drop operations when mission requirements dictate, adjust  the  appropriate  harness  length  to  preclude  exiting  the  aircraft  before  opening  the paratroop door(s)): 18.13.1.1.  Connect  and  adjust  the  lifeline  to  a  floor  tie-down  ring  that  precludes  the wearer from exiting an aircraft (no further aft than FS 737). 18.13.1.2.  Restraint  harness  lifelines  may  be  attached  to  an  unused  anchor  cable provided no static lines are attached and an anchor the cable stop is positioned and taped at FS 737. The center anchor cable support may be used in lieu of the stop if lowered.  Do not use this configuration(s) if both paratroop doors are open at the same time.  Instead, connect  and  adjust  the  lifeline  to  a  floor  tie-down  ring  that  would  preclude  the  wearer from exiting either exit. 18.13.1.3.  Connect the lifeline when at or anticipating movement aft of FS 737. 18.13.1.4.  Onboard safety personnel normally provide their own parachute. Alternately, at  their  discretion,  they  may  use  a  restraint  harness.  Personnel  required  to  be  mobile  in the  cargo  compartment  will  wear  a  restraint  harness  or  parachute  before  doors  are opened.  (T-2).  For  static  line  jumps,  static  lines  are  attached  to  anchor  cables  before doors  are  opened.    EXCEPTION:    Jumpers  exiting  on  subsequent  passes  (racetracks) may stand and hook up with doors open if they are forward of the aft edge of the wheel wells FS 617.  NOTE: Do not use the flight deck restraint harness for airdrops. 18.14.  General Airdrop Flight Procedures. 18.14.1.  Airdrop  Checklists.  Airdrop  checklists  are  located  in  the  TO  1C-130(H)J-1. Checklists may be compressed or completed early if mission requirements dictate.  Normally, all  items  of  the  preceding  checklist  are  to  be  accomplished  prior  to  initiating  the  next checklist.  Avoid the use of the word “GREEN” or “LIGHT” after initiation of the slowdown checklist until arriving at the release point. 18.14.2.  Aircrew No Drop Decisions. 188 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 18.14.2.1.  Prior to the “1-MINUTE” call, any crewmember who determines a condition exists that could jeopardize a safe drop will notify the PIC. (T-2).  A “NO DROP” can be called at the discretion of the PIC. initiates it  will  be  followed the  "NO  DROP"  call, 18.14.2.2.  After  the  “1-MINUTE”  call,  any  crewmember  observing  a  condition  that would  jeopardize  a  safe  drop  will  transmit  “NO  DROP”  on  ICS.  (T-2).    Regardless  of who immediately  by  an acknowledgement  from  the  loadmaster  and  pilot  monitoring.  (T-2).    The  LM  will accomplish the applicable no drop procedures before performing the COMPLETION OF DROP checklist. (T-2). The PIC must ensure the crew is aware of what the plan is in the event of a no drop (race track, alternate DZ, RTB, etc.) and instruct the crew to follow the appropriate procedures. (T-2). 18.14.2.3.  If a “NO DROP” is called after the load restraint is removed and a racetrack is not planned, the LM will reapply restraint. (T-2). 18.14.2.4.  For non-contingency operations, crews will not allow a load to exit the aircraft while CARP VERT and/or CARP XTRK are displayed. 18.14.3.  Departure from Drop Zone (Escape). The PM/CSO will call "RED LIGHT" at the expiration  of  the  "GREEN  LIGHT"  time  or  upon  hearing  the  LM’s  call  of  "LOAD CLEAR/MALFUNCION," whichever occurs first. 18.14.3.1.  When  the  red  light  is  turned  on,  immediately  begin  the  escape  maneuver  by tracking flaps if required, turning to the departure heading, increase airspeed as required, and attain  enroute altitude.  NOTE:  During combat, static lines that cannot be retrieved will be cut so that doors can be closed. 18.14.4.  Multiple  Passes  (Racetrack).  Multiple  passes  will  not  be  made  unless  directed  or previously agreed upon by all units involved. (T-2).  If multiple passes are flown, crews will accomplish  all  airdrop  checklists.  (T-2).    Checklists  may  be  compressed  during  racetracks, but  the  aircraft  commander  must  ensure  the  LM  has  adequate  time  to  complete  all  items before  the  drop  is  initiated.  (T-2).    The  One  Minute  Warning  is  never  compressed  and  is always  given  on  time.  EXCEPTION:    During  pilot  directed  airdrops,  the  checklist  may  be initiated at a point commensurate with the available time and type of drop. Doors may remain open at the discretion of the PIC. 18.15.  IMC Airdrop Procedures. 18.15.1.  IMC Drop Altitude. Plan minimum  IMC drop altitude of 500  ft above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400 ft plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is higher, within 3 NM of the run-in centerline from DZ entry point to DZ exit point, or as specified in AFI 11-231, whichever is higher. 18.15.2.  IFR Drop Corridor. As defined in FAR Exemption 4371, the corridor where aircraft may  transition  between  IMC  enroute  altitude  and  IMC  drop  altitude  to  perform  airdrop operations.  The  beginning  of  the  corridor,  the  IFR  Drop  Corridor  Ingress  Point,  is  a maximum of 40 NMs from the IFR Drop Corridor Egress Point (co-located with the DZ Exit Point). Plan segmented corridor altitudes not lower than 500 ft above the highest obstruction to flight (manmade obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400 ft plus one contour AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 189 interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is highest, within 3 NMs either side of centerline. 18.15.2.1.  DZ  Entry  Point.  The  point  where  an  aircraft  may  safely  begin  descent  from IFR enroute altitude or a segmented altitude to IMC drop altitude. 18.15.2.2.  DZ  Exit  Point.  A  fixed  point  on  the  DZ  escape  flight  path  centerline  where each aircraft is at minimum IFR enroute altitude. Normally, calculate the exit point based on  a  1000  FPM  climb  at  140  KIAS.  Analyze  3-engine  climb  performance  and  ensure obstacle  clearance  at  pre-airdrop  gross  weight.  If  unable  to  clear  all  obstacles  on  3-engines, adjust the DZ exit point based on 3-engine climb capability. This point will be a minimum  of  4  NMs  track  distance  from  the  trailing  edge  of  the  DZ.  WARNING: Analyze pre-drop gross weight to determine if obstructions can be cleared on 3- engines from DZ Entry through DZ Exit. If obstructions cannot be cleared, reduce aircraft gross weight, revise run-in and/or escape course, or increase drop altitude. 18.16.  High  Altitude  Airdrop  Procedures.  Airdrops  conducted  above  3,000  ft  AGL  are considered  high  altitude  drops.  EXCEPTION:    RAMZ  airdrops  at  or  below  3,500  ft  AGL  are considered  low  altitude  drops.    PSYOPS  are  governed  by  paragraph  16.44.          NOTE:    Only essential personnel who have accomplished appropriate physiological training described in AFI 11-403,  Aerospace  Physiological  Training  Program,  are  permitted  on  mission  aircraft  for airdrops above 10,000 ft MSL. 18.16.1.  Crewmembers will follow established MAJCOM oxygen mask requirements. (T-2). See  AFI  11-202V3  ACC  Supplement  for  additional  guidance.  AFI  11-409,  High-Altitude Airdrop  Mission  Support  Program,  is  the  source  document  for  high-altitude  oxygen,  pre-breathing, and Physiology Technician (PT) requirements/restrictions. 18.16.2.  The  JM  may  dictate  the  use  of  supplemental  oxygen  by  any  or  all  jumpers  at altitudes  less  than  those  listed.  Parachutists  transfer  from  the  aircraft  oxygen  system  or portable oxygen console to a personal oxygen system at approximately 1 minute before green light. 18.16.3.  High Altitude Emergency Procedures. If a physiological incident occurs: 18.16.3.1.  Abort the mission. 18.16.3.2.  Begin descent (pressurization and descent will be determined by the type and degree of sickness or pain). 18.16.3.3.  Ensure  the  affected  person  remains  on  100%  oxygen  until  a  medical  doctor determines the type of treatment required. 18.16.3.4.  Proceed to the nearest base with qualified medical assistance available. 18.16.3.5.  Advise the control tower of the emergency and request an ambulance meet the aircraft. 18.16.4.  High Altitude Mission Requirements 18.16.4.1.  The aircrew will compute a high altitude release point (HARP) solution for all HALO  or  HAHO  drops  unless  specific  mission  directives  dictate  otherwise.  (T-2).  Use the Personnel Airdrop checklist. 190 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 18.16.4.2.  For all HALO/HAHO operations, CSOs will provide the JM with a magnetic course +/- 5 degrees and a distance (NM or yards) from the release point to the drop zone. (T-2). 18.16.4.3.  CSOs  will  compare  their  HARP  location  and  calculations  with  the  JM  chart and  calculations.  (T-2).    Aircrew  will  ensure  all  aspects  of  HALO/HAHO  airdrops  are discussed  in  detail  at  the  aircrew/jumpmaster  briefing.  (T-2).    NOTE:  Due  to  potential ballistic data and release point variations between the primary mission planning software, AFI 11-231 and the CNI-MU, calculations performed IAW AFI 11-231 ballistic data and supporting  FCIFs  will  be  the  primary  source  for  HC-130J  HARPs.    This  may  drive  a manual  release  point,  depending  on  the  currency  of  MPE,  aircraft  software,  and MAJCOM approved HAAD training plans. 18.16.4.4.  In-flight  changes  to  the  HARP  location  or  significant  wind  changes  are relayed to the JM as soon as possible. 18.16.4.5.  The  CNI-MU  winds  may  be  used  to  update  preflight  HARP  winds  and  to determine and update the winds at altitude. 18.16.4.6.  For HALO, the aircrew must confirm positive identification of the drop zone area electronically or visually prior to calling the release. (T-2). 18.16.5.  Pressurization Scheduling.  Maintain  cabin  pressure  at  or  below  10,000  ft  until  the Twenty  Minute  Warning  and  until  prebreathing  is  complete.  Pressurizing  after  the  drop  is IAW mission requirements; normally, the cabin altitude should return to 10,000 ft or below as  soon  as  possible.  If  any  jumpers  are  still  onboard,  ensure  the  parachutes  automated actuation devices are disabled prior to descending or pressurizing. 18.16.6.1.  Drop Configuration. 18.16.6.1.1.  Flaps.  Normal  configuration  is  with  50%  flaps.  However,  at  high altitudes, it may be desirable to use less flaps. 18.16.6.1.2.  Airspeed. The JM will be briefed on the airspeed used. (T-2). 18.16.6.1.3.  Altitude.  Pressure  or  indicated  altitude  is  used  as  the  airdrop  altitude reference. 18.16.7.  Exits. 18.16.7.1.  Parachutists  normally  exit  from  the  cargo  door  and  ramp.  All  parachutists, with the exception of the JM, will stand forward of the ramp hinge until the One-Minute Warning. 18.16.7.2.  A paratroop door may be used in lieu of the cargo door and ramp. When this is the case, the crew will open the air deflector doors. (T-2).  All parachutists, except JM, will stand forward of the paratroop door until the One Minute Warning. (T-2).   NOTE: Jump  platforms  must  be  installed.    NOTE:  All  parachutists,  including  JM,  will  exit  the aircraft during the green light time. (T-2). 18.16.8.  Communications  and  Signals.  The  LM  will  coordinate  the  following  hand  signals with the JM. (T-2). AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 191 18.16.8.1.  Time warnings (20, 10, 6, 2, and 1-minute) may be given to the parachutists by the LM pointing at a watch and then indicating with fingers the correct warning. 18.16.8.2.  The  velocity  of  winds  on  the  DZ  will  be  given  by  the  LM  by  cupping  one hand and blowing into it, then indicating with upturned fingers the speed of the wind. (T-2). 18.16.8.3.  The crew will indicate a no drop by passing a hand slash across the throat. (T-2). 18.16.8.4.  LMs  will  have  pencil  and  paper  available  during  airdrops  for  use  in communicating with parachutists. (T-2). 18.17.  Personnel Airdrop Procedures. 18.17.1.  LMs  will  ensure  JMs  receive  all  time  advisories,  wind  updates,  and  no-drop decisions when passed. (T-2). 18.17.1.1.  The LM must ensure air deflectors are operational if paratroop doors are used. (T-2). If an air deflector does not extend, do not open the affected troop door. 18.17.1.2.  LMs/Personnel  will  not  position  themselves  directly  under  the  center  anchor cable  supports  (A-Frame,  FS  737)  in  case  of  anchor  cable  or  support  mounting  failure. (T-2). WARNING: Ensure all personnel are secured to the aircraft or have a static line(s) connected prior to  opening ramp  and door/troop  door(s). HALO/HAHO  personnel  must be configured and ready to jump. 18.17.1.3.  Loadmaster-Jumpmaster Control. 18.17.1.3.1.  At  completion  of  the  Slowdown  Checklist,  the  LM  will  allow  the  JM access to the paratroop door or ramp no later than (NLT) 1 minute prior to jump. (T-2). 18.17.1.3.2.  For JM-directed airdrops using the SEARCH AND RESCUE checklists, after  Pre-Deployment  checks  are  complete,  the  LM  will  allow  the  JM  access  to paratroop door or ramp NLT 2 minutes prior to the jump. (T-2). 18.17.1.3.3.  The LM will then take position in such a manner as to provide maximum maneuverability for the JM and safety NCOs to  perform their duties, and to prevent interference with exiting jumpers. (T-2).  Upon seeing the red jump lights illuminate, the LM will notify the JM or safety personnel of the red light condition.  (T-2).   The LM will take no further action to stop any of the remaining parachutists. (T-2).  The LM will count (if possible) any parachutists that exit the aircraft after the red light has illuminated. (T-2).  WARNING:  Do not attempt to physically stop or hinder jumpers from exiting the aircraft if jumpers continue to exit after "red light". 18.17.1.3.4.  Control  of  the  paratroop  door/cargo  ramp  will  revert  back  to  the  LM after all parachutists have exited or remaining parachutists have been stopped by the JM or safety NCO and cleared from the paratroop door/cargo ramp area. (T-2). 18.17.1.3.5.  For multiple passes (racetracks), after assuming control of the paratroop door/cargo  ramp  from  the  JM,  the  LM(s)  will  maintain  control  of  the  doors/cargo ramp until completion of subsequent Slowdown Checklists. 192 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 18.18.  Fouled  Parachutist  Procedures.  The  JM  or  safety  observer  is  responsible  to  observe the  fouled  parachutist  and  recommend  whether  to  retrieve  or  cut  the  parachutist  free.  If  all parachutists have exited and there is no JM on board, this responsibility rests with the LM. The recommendation  is  relayed,  by  the  LM,  to  the  PIC  who  makes  the  final  decision  whether  to retrieve  or  cut  the  parachutist  free.  The  LM  will  initiate  retrieval  or  cut  the  parachutist‘s  static line  on  the  pilot‘s  command.  (T-2).    When  a  parachutist  is  observed  to  be  fouled  during  a paratroop  door  exit,  the  first  priority  is  to  retrieve,  regardless  if  the  parachutist  is  conscious  or unconscious.  If  the  parachutist  cannot  be  retrieved  and  indicates  consciousness,  cut  the parachutist free. For a tailgate exit, the first priority is to cut the parachutist free if the parachutist indicates consciousness. If the parachutist is unconscious, does not signal, cannot be observed, or a condition exists that prevents cutting the static line, implement emergency retrieval procedures. 18.18.1.  The  JM  stops  remaining  parachutists  and  the  LM  notifies  the  pilot  of  a  fouled parachutist. 18.18.2.  Upon being notified of a fouled parachutist, aircrew will follow T.O. 1C-130(H)J-1 procedures for Airdrop  Emergency Operations.  (T-2).   If fouled parachutist  is  equipped for airdrop  on  land,  avoid  flying  upwind  or  over  water  if  possible.    If  fouled  parachutist  is equipped for airdrop in water, avoid flying upwind or over land if possible. 18.18.3.  The PF maintains at least the minimum drop altitude (AGL) for the type parachute being used, and avoids flying over or upwind of water or built up areas.     EXCEPTION:  If the  parachutist  is  equipped  for  a  water  drop,  the  PF  should  avoid  flying  over  land.     WARNING: If possible, the PF will avoid turning the aircraft in the direction of the fouled parachutist. Turning into the parachutist often starts violent swinging of the parachutist and poses an increased possibility of injury to the fouled parachutist. 18.18.4.  The PM turns on the red light. 18.18.5.  The parachutist  indicates consciousness and that the  reserve parachute is  ready by maintaining a tight body position with both hands on the reserve parachute. 18.18.6.  If the PIC’s decision is to cut the parachutist free, the parachutist‘s static line will be cut by the LM on the PIC’s command. (T-2). 18.19.  Emergency Parachutist Bailout. 18.19.1.  Maintain  an  acceptable  altitude  and  attitude  for  the  parachutists  to  evacuate  the aircraft.  The  minimum  acceptable  altitude  is  400  ft  AGL  for  static  line  deployments  and 1,000 ft AGL for personnel freefall deployments. If the jump is made at airspeed in excess of 140 KIAS, advise parachutists of the airspeed and altitude. 18.19.2.  If  conditions  are  unsuitable  for  aircraft  evacuation,  turn  the  red  light  on  until  exit doors are closed. The PIC advises the JM through the LM to have the parachutists unhook, take their seats, and fasten seatbelts. 18.20.  Jumpmaster  Directed  (JMD)  Airdrop  Procedures.  JMD  airdrops  require  OG/CC  or higher  approval.  EXCEPTION:    Unilateral  PJ  airdrops  for  continuation  training.  These  drops may  be  performed  by  qualified  AF  or  sister  service  JMs  (or  trainees  under  the  supervision  of qualified personnel), may direct the aircraft to a release point and determine the exit point IAW the following restrictions and procedures: AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 193 18.20.1.  Crews will conduct JMD airdrops using the SEARCH AND RESCUE checklists in AFI 11-2HC-130J Vol 3 Attachment 2 or appropriate checklists in the TO 1C-130(H)J-1. (T-2). 18.20.2.  Airdrop  personnel  in  VMC  only.        NOTE:  For  PJ JMD  airdrops  of  ATV/RAMZ packages, crews will use SEARCH AND RESCUE checklists and either a Fixed, Moving, or Crosswind Target Pattern for deployment or appropriate checklists in the TO 1C-130(H)J-1. (T-2). 18.20.3.  The  JM  parent  service/user  accepts  all  responsibility  for  the  accuracy  of  the  drop, plus any potential injuries/damage to equipment. See AFI 13-217 for additional guidance. 18.20.4.  In-flight visual signals, verbal signals, and interphone procedures between the JM, LM, and pilots will be coordinated prior to takeoff. (T-2). 18.20.5.  HALO and HAHO operations may be conducted using JMD procedures. 18.20.6.  Personnel will not exit the aircraft unless the green light is illuminated. (T-2). 18.20.7.  The CSO will still calculate a CARP/HARP for mission planning purposes.  (T-2).  CNI-MU  calculated  CARP/HARPs  will  be  used  to  back  up  the  computations  and  in-flight directions  given  by  the  JM.  (T-2).    Prior  to  flight,  the  aircrew  and  the  JM  will  compare predicted  release  points,  resolve  any  significant  differences,  and  agree  to  a  planned slowdown  point  or  time.  (T-2).  The  CSO  will  update  the  JM  in-flight  on  actual  wind information and any changes to the crew’s preflight CARP/HARP location. (T-2). 18.20.8.  Standard  Voice  Terminology.  (T-2)  When  the  JM  provides  assistance  on  final approach, crewmembers will use the following standard voice terminology: 18.20.8.1.  "Steady" (present course is satisfactory.) 18.20.8.2.  "Right" (change direction to the right 5 degrees.) 18.20.8.3.  "Left" (change direction to the left 5 degrees.) 18.20.8.4.  "Right  or  left  __  degrees"  (change  direction  as  indicated.)  This  direction  is utilized when directional changes in excess of 5 degrees are desired. 18.20.8.5.  "No-drop"  (no-drop unsatisfactory positioning over the target.) is  called  for  unsafe  or  unknown  conditions  or 18.20.8.6.  "Load Clear" (jumpers or cargo bundles have cleared the aircraft and the PF is clear  to  make  a  turn  to  begin  the  next  pass  and/or  observe  results  of  the  drop  just accomplished.) 18.20.8.7.  Hand  Signals.  The  JM  may  use  the  following  hand  signals  to  relay  course corrections through the safety man: Thumb left/right, indicating 5-degree correction; and palm open, fingers pointed toward the cockpit, indicating steady. 18.20.9.  Deployment Procedures. 18.20.9.1.  No less than 2 minutes out from the release point, the LM will allow the JM access to the door to begin the "spotting procedures." (T-2).  JM duties can be performed from  any  position  in  either  paratroop  door  or  the  ramp  and  door;  however,  it  is recommended that the JM use the right door for right-hand patterns and the left door for 194 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 left-hand patterns. The JM, when wearing a parachute, will connect the static line to the anchor cable designated for use.  (T-2).  When wearing  an adjusted restraint  harness,  the JM  will  connect  to  the  personnel  restraint  system  or  to  a  tie-down  ring  that  would preclude  the  wearer  from  exiting  the  aircraft.  (T-2).  The  JM  visually  relays  steering signals  to  the  LM,  who  verbally  relays  this  information  to  the  PF.        WARNING:  The paratroop door(s) and the cargo ramp and door will not be opened at the same time.  (T-2).    EXCEPTION:    Authorized  LM-directed  airdrops  of  bundles  off  the  ramp  while spotting from a single open paratroop door. 18.20.9.2.  Once safety checks are complete, and the pilot determines that all conditions are favorable for deployment upon reaching the planned/desired exit point, the pilot states "CLEAR TO JUMP" and the PM turns on the green light.  Jumpers exit the aircraft upon reaching  the  JMs  identified  release  point.    NOTE:    The  aircrew  may  turn  on  the  green light once the drop zone has been positively identified, but no earlier than 1 minute prior to  the release point for freefall operations, or 30  seconds for static line operations.  If at any time exit of jumpers becomes unsafe (aircraft emergency or similar circumstances), the  aircrew  will  turn  on  the  red  light  and  the  LM  will  direct  the  JM  to  stop  remaining parachutists (T-2). 18.20.9.3.  Mixed  Procedures.  LMs  will  not  mix  JMD  releases  with  any  other  type  of airdrop method (e.g., GMRS, VIRS) or standard CARP drops.  (T-2).    When JMD drop procedures  are  used,  the  crew  should  follow  the  JM‘s  instructions,  while  adhering  to normal safety concerns. 18.21.  Pararescue  JMD  Fixed,  Moving,  and  Crosswind  Target  Patterns.  For  PJ  JMD airdrops of ATV/RAMZ/ARC/CRL packages, Pararescue Fixed, Moving, and Crosswind Target Patterns will be used running the SEARCH AND RESCUE checklists. These procedures may be used for JMD pararescue personnel only drops. Comply with the applicable guidance in section 18.17. 18.21.1.  Pre-Deployment Evaluation. In a permissive environment, evaluation of the landing surface  and  surrounding  obstructions  should  be  accomplished  by  observation  passes. Evaluation of the weather should include existing and forecast temperatures, wind direction, precipitation,  cloud  cover,  fog,  visibility,  etc.  Wind  velocity  evaluations include consideration  of  direction,  gusts,  and  wind  shear.  The  crew  should  keep  the  JM  advised  of current mean altitude winds. The presence of rocks or stumps may impose a lower maximum velocity while the presence of trees, unfrozen tundra, or soft snow might permit safe jumping at higher velocities. 18.21.2.  General.  Pararescuemen  (PJ)  wearing  static  line  parachutes  normally  deploy through  a  single  paratroop  door  or  off  the  cargo  ramp  (tailgate).  The  LM  will  connect  the parachute static lines to the anchor cable on the same side as the static line retriever that has been rigged for airdrop. (T-2).  No more than 20 parachutists may exit on a single pass either from the paratroop door or off the ramp. The LM will ensure streamer/spotter chutes are used prior to JMD PJ deployments using Pararescue Fixed Target, Moving Target, or Crosswind Target deployment patterns. (T-2). 18.21.2.1.  Streamers  are  20-ft  lengths  of  crepe  paper  weighted  on  one  end.  The  spotter chute  used  is  the  standard  J-1  (12  ft  diameter)  wind  drift  determination  parachute.  The spotter  chute  weight  can  be  provided  by  the  PJ  or  designated  smoke.  When  the  signal AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 195 marker smoke is used, the JM will signal the safetyman/LM when to launch the smoke. (T-2).    Immediately  upon  receiving  the  signal,  the  safetyman/LM  will  simultaneously activate and launch the smoke. (T-2). 18.21.2.2.  The safetyman/LM will assist the JM in launching the streamer/spotter chute and  remain  at  the  door  during  PJ  deployments.  (T-2).    The  JM,  Pilot,  and  CSO  will confirm the exit point prior to release. (T-2).  NOTE:  For low altitude JMD PJ drops, a CARP  is  not  required  when  using  streamers/spotter  chutes.        WARNING:  During paratroop door static line personnel drops, personnel will not position themselves directly under the center anchor cable supports (A- frame, FS 737.) (T-2). 18.21.3.  Deployment Pattern. The normal flight pattern is a racetrack pattern, with the final approach from spotting device to target.     NOTE: See AFI 11-231 for detailed guidance on Pararescue Fixed Target, Moving Target, or Crosswind Target deployment patterns. NOTE: Pararescuemen  will  not  be  deployed  from  aircraft  with  gross  weights  greater  than  155,000 lbs.          NOTE:  Static  line  deployments  at  airspeeds  above  130  KIAS  are  prohibited  due  to parachute limitations. 18.21.3.1.  The JM must be kept advised of the position of the aircraft in the pattern and the PIC must be kept informed of the activities in the rear of the aircraft. (T-2). 18.21.4.  Deployment  Procedures.  In  addition  to  the  deployment  procedures  listed  in paragraph 16.38.5.9, the comply with the following procedures: 18.21.4.1.  Leave the red light on for dry passes and streamer/spotter chute patterns. 18.21.4.2.  On  final  for  live  drops,  the  pilot  will  make  a  "CREW,  1-MINUTE WARNING" call (T-2).  WARNING:  For the confined lake or near shore water drops of PJ  personnel  or  RAMZ  training,  the  “CREW,  1-MINUTE  WARNING”  may  occur  if over land. Exercise extreme caution when calculated release point is over land to ensure that personnel/equipment will land in the water. 18.21.5.  Post-Deployment.  Maintain  visual  or  radio  contact  with  the  pararescue  team  and maintain surveillance of the area for possible natural or man-made hazards. After pararescue deployment, the PIC will notify the appropriate agencies to ensure required team support is provided.  (T-2).   Every effort is expended to ensure that the pararescue team is covered by rescue  aircraft  until  the  party  is  assured  of  surface  assistance.  Surface  assistance  for  land operation is not required as long as sufficient supplies are available. Prior to departure of the aircraft  from  the  incident  site,  resupply  schedules,  communication  schedules,  supply requirements, and planned actions of the pararescue team will be established by the aircraft commander and team leader. (T-2). 18.21.5.1.  Primary  and  alternate  frequencies,  schedules,  and  an  alternate  method  of communication  will  be  established  by  the  mission  commander  and  included  in  the mission commander’s pre-mission brief. (T-2). 18.21.5.2.  If  practicable,  the  pararescuemen  will  immediately  establish  radio  contact with the drop aircraft upon penetration of the incident site. (T-2).   The team leader then verifies  the  predetermined  schedule  for  the  next  radio  contact  before  the  drop  aircraft departs the area. 196 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 18.21.5.3.  In  the  event  the  PJ  team  fails  to  establish  communication  at  the  initial  pre-briefed  time,  maximum  effort  is  made  on  the  next  check  or  the  alternate  schedule  until radio contact is established. 18.21.5.4.  If  communication  cannot  be  established  through  the  procedures  outlined above,  any  other  method  of  communication  may  be  used  to  relay  information  to  the rescue team. 18.21.5.5.  Radio is used as the primary method of communication. The MK 13 day/night flares are the alternate method. When signals for special purposes are needed, they may be locally devised. 18.21.6.  Pararescue Deployments to Ships. 18.21.6.1.  In  sea  conditions  other  than  calm,  it  is  essential  the  ship  have  a  motorized launch in the water prior to team deployment, unless the PJ team deploys with a RAMZ watercraft.        WARNING:    The  aircrew  will  prepare  an  MA-1  sea  rescue  kit  for deployment  from  the  cargo  ramp  as  soon  as  practical  following  an  open  water  PJ deployment (not required for training). (T-2). 18.21.6.1.1.  Positioning  and  maneuvering  of  the  ship,  motorized  launch,  and deployment  of  the  MA-1  kit  is  the  ship  captain’s  decision.  When  possible,  the  PIC should advise the ship captain on positioning and maneuvering prior to  deployment. The crew should determine whether the ship can remain still in the water, whether the ship should be steered into the wind or crosswind, and where the launch needs to be positioned. 18.21.6.1.2.  The rescue aircraft should deploy the pararescue team  to  the motorized launch.  The  launch  should  maintain  its  position  during  the  deployment  pattern.   WARNING:  The  crew  will  make  every  effort  to  advise  the  ship  to  shut  down  its propellers anytime a pararescuemen is in the water alongside it. (T-2). 18.21.6.1.3.  In the case that a decision is made to deploy the team without the use of a  motorized  launch,  it  is  critical  that  the  method  of  boarding  is  verified  prior  to deployment. 18.22.  Rigged  Alternate  Method  Zodiac  (RAMZ)/All  Terrain  Vehicle  (ATV)  Equipment Airdrops. For additional guidance see AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 18.22.1.  Deployment Altitudes. 18.22.1.1.  The  minimum  deployment  altitude  is  3,000  ft  AWL/AGL  when  the  PJs  exit using non-static line deployed parachutes. Higher altitudes may be used for training. 18.22.1.2.  For  operational  missions,  minimum  altitude  with  a  non-static  line  deployed parachute is 2,500 ft AWL/AGL. 18.22.1.3.  The  minimum  deployment  altitude  for  training  or  non-combat  single-pass combination  air  drops  of  RAMZ/ATV  and  PJs  exiting  with  static  lines  is  800  ft AWL/AGL. NOTE: The RAMZ/ATV and PJs is deployed from the same altitude. 18.22.1.4.  Exit  times:  AFI  11-231  does  not  currently  contain  exit  time  data  for conducting a RAMZ airdrop.  Use an exit time of 1 to 3 seconds RAMZ airdrops. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 197 18.22.2.  Deployment Procedures. In addition to  the deployment procedures required by the specific method of delivery being used, the following procedures apply: 18.22.2.1.  Parachutists using static line deployed parachutes will attach their static lines to the same anchor cable to which the RAMZ/ATV static lines are attached or jump on a subsequent pass after the RAMZ/ATV static line deployment bags are retrieved. (T-2). 18.22.2.2.  Military freefall parachutists may exit from the aircraft ramp on the same pass after  the  RAMZ/ATV  static  line  deployment  bags  are  retrieved  or  cut,  or  exit  on  a subsequent pass using Fixed/Moving target JMD procedures, as appropriate. If dropping from  the  paratroop  door  on  the  subsequent  pass,  complete  the  POST-DEPLOYMENT checklist, and initiate the PRE-DEPLOYMENT checklist. 18.22.2.3.  For JMD drops, at the pilot‘s "ONE MINUTE ADVISORY" call, the JM may be  on  either  side  of  the  cargo  ramp  and  may  be  spotting  from  the  aft  end.  Additional jumpers  will  be  forward  of  the  RAMZ/ATV.  (T-2).    The  LM  will  be  positioned  to remove  aft  restraint  and  to  observe  equipment  and  jumpers  at  all  times.  (T-2).    At  the "ONE MINUTE ADVISORY," the JM will be alerted, the load release gate is checked, and the aft restraint is removed. (T-2). 18.22.2.4.  The LM will relay "Safety Checks Complete" to the PF if the JM has already gone off interphone. (T-2).  The PM will turn on the green light, indicating to the JM that conditions are satisfactory for the airdrop. (T-2). 18.22.2.5.  The  JM  will  determine  the  exit  point  and  deploy  prior  to  receiving  a  “No-drop” notification or seeing the red light on. (T-2).  The LM will relay to the PF all visual corrections given by the JM. (T-2).  The JM will signal for the LM to cut the release gate. (T-2).      WARNING:  If  a  “No-drop”  is  called  and  the  RAMZ/ATV  is  held  in  place  by only the release gate, all personnel will move forward of the load, except the LM and the JM  who  monitor  the  RAMZ/ATV  for  possible  shifting  and  secure  as  necessary.  (T-2).   WARNING:  If  the  RAMZ/ATV  exits  the  aircraft  but  fails  to  properly  deploy,  the  LM will  cut  the  static  lines  immediately.  (T-2).    CAUTION:  The  LM  must  cut  the  release gate below the knot to allow the nylon strap to pull free through floor tie down rings. (T-2). 18.22.3.  Limitations. During training, limit sea state for RAMZ to 5, Moderate Wave (10ft), taking  a  pronounced  long  form,  with  many  white  caps.  Limitations  for  operational  or contingency missions will be determined by the JM in coordination with the PIC. (T-2). 18.23.  Combination  Airdrops.  Combination  drops  are  those  during  which  parachutists  exit from the aircraft ramp after the deployment of an airdrop load. When tailgating parachutists, the drop altitude is determined by the item requiring the highest drop altitude per AFI 11-231. If an additional pass is needed to drop all the personnel after a combination CDS drop, close the ramp and door and re-rig the static line retriever cable as depicted in TO 1C-130(H)J-9. 18.24.  Equipment Airdrop Procedures. 18.24.1.  Specialized Rescue Airdrop Procedures. 18.24.2.  Aircrew will use the SEARCH AND RESCUE checklist or the PERSONNEL/CRL checklist for specialized rescue airdrops. 18.24.3.  Free Fall Airdrops. For additional guidance see AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 & AFI 11-231. 198 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 18.24.3.1.  Drift Effect. For free-fall airdrops, wind drift need not be considered. 18.24.4.  Parabundle  Airdrops.  For  additional  guidance  see  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  &  AFI  11-231. 18.24.5.  MA-1 Kit Airdrop.  For additional guidance see AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 & AFI 11-231. 18.24.6.  Minimum Drop Altitudes. For freefall airdrops minimum altitude during the day is 150 ft and 500 ft at night.  For parabundle & MA-1 kit airdrops minimum altitude during the day is 300 ft and 500 ft at night.  WARNING:  Keeps turns below 300 ft AGL to a minimum. 18.24.7.  Combat  Rubber  Raiding  Craft  (CRRC).  For  additional  guidance  see  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130. 18.24.8.  PSYOPS Drops (Leaflets). see AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 18.25.  Door Bundle Airdrops 18.25.1.  General A-7A or A-21 containers weighing up to 500 lbs (excluding the weight of the parachutes) are  referred to  as  "door bundles"  and  are dropped from  the aircraft through the  paratroop  door  or  ramp  and  door  using  the  PERSONNEL/CRL  or  SEARCH  AND RESCUE  checklist.  Loads  weighing  more  than  350  lbs  require  two  trained  designated pushers to assist the LM/JM in pushing loads from the aircraft. Door bundles may be dropped independently or with personnel and are limited to one bundle per exit used. When dropped with  personnel,  the  bundle  is  the  first  object  to  exit  the  aircraft.  Remove  restraints  and position the bundle in the paratroop door or on the ramp prior to completion of the slowdown checklist  (EXCEPTION:  If  the  JM  needs  the  paratroop  door  for  spotting,  place  the  door bundle as close as possible to the paratroop door). If jumpers are to follow the door bundle, the  user  is  responsible  for  ejecting  the  bundle  out  the  troop  door  or  off the  ramp.  Maintain positive control of all door bundles exiting out the cargo ramp. To maintain positive control of door bundles exiting over the ramp, it may be necessary to secure the forward end of the bundle  to  a  suitable  floor  tiedown  ring  with  550  cord  or  suitable  substitute.  This  tie  is  to prevent premature release of the bundle and is cut by the LM at the release point. 18.25.1.1.  The  LM  will  rig  door  bundles  dropped  from  the  paratroop  doors  with  non-breakaway  static  lines.  (T-2).    The  LM  must  ensure  the  dimensions,  including  the parachute,  do  not  exceed  48  inches  by  30  inches  by  66  inches  unless  authorized  in  a specific  T.O.  (T-2).    When  the  container  is  placed  in  the  door  for  airdrop,  place  the largest dimension in the vertical or upright position. 18.25.1.2.  LMs  must  ensure  door  bundles  followed  by  paratroopers  dropped  from  the ramp  and  door  or  paratroop  door(s)  are  rigged  with  a  T-10  parachute  (converted  for cargo)  or  parachute  equipped  with  breakaway  static  lines  (per  T.O.  13C7-1-11).  (T-2).  Also, bundles rigged for a ramp exit are equipped with a skid board compatible with the center  roller  conveyors.        NOTE:    If  no  parachutists  are  to  be  dropped  after  the  door bundles, the LM must ensure non-breakaway static lines are used. (T-2).    The LM must ensure  anchor  cable  stops  are  positioned  as  depicted  in  T.O.  1C-130(H)J-9  for  CDS airdrops. (T-2). 18.25.2.  During unilateral single-ship airdrop training, the LM must ensure door bundles do not exit the aircraft after a paratrooper has jumped.  (T-2).  NOTE:  During joint training, a AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 199 combat or contingency operation, the user determines door bundle requirements and order of exit from any or all personnel airdrop aircraft in the formation. 18.25.3.  When  door  bundles  are  dropped  with  personnel,  compute  the  CARP  for  the  first paratrooper exiting after the bundle and compute an additional CARP for the door bundle to ensure that it impacts on the DZ. Release the bundle at the personnel CARP, followed by the parachutists when the door is clear. When a door bundle is the only object dropped, base the CARP on the bundle. 18.26.  Container Ramp Load(CRL)/Ramp Bundle. 18.26.1.  CRL/Ramp Bundle. CRLs may consist of A-series containers (e.g. double A-22 or single A-22) or loads rigged on combat expendable platforms (e.g. ATV, motorcycle) rigged for airdrop  from  the cargo ramp  or floor. CRLs  are individually  restrained with  a length of Type VIII nylon webbing (release gate) routed through ramp/floor tiedown rings and secured to the container webbing on the forward and aft side. At the release point the LM manually cuts the release gate, allowing the bundle to exit from the aircraft. The LM must ensure ramp bundles are rigged IAW T.O. 13C7- series rigging manuals. (T-2).  The LM must ensure the total weight of the bundle does not exceed 2335 lbs. (T-2).  The LM must ensure loads to be followed by parachutists are rigged with  breakaway  static lines, unless specified in  specific rigging directive. (T-2).  The LM must ensure all remaining restraint are removed prior to the completion of the 10 minute checklist (EXCEPTION:  Forward restraint for CRLs rigged on the ramp may be removed after the cargo ramp and door are in the ADS position and prior to the  completion  of  the  slowdown  checklist).  (T-2).    The  bundle  may  be  followed  by personnel. These procedures may be accomplished from either side of the ramp or from the centerline.  Specific  aircraft  preparation  and  rigging  procedures  are  contained  in  T.O.1C-130(H)J-9, Section VII. 18.26.1.1.  Exit Time Adjustment:  AFI 11-231 does not  currently contain  exit time data for CRL airdrops.  For CRL aidrops use an exit time of 1-3 seconds until more specific data is developed. NOTE: The CSO will discuss approximate exit times with the LM as this time varies on LM experience and strength. (T-2). 18.27.  CDS Airdrops. 18.27.1.  Manual  CDS  gate  cuts  are  authorized  for  all  CDS/I-CDS/JPADS  single-stick airdrops (CVR or non-CVR). A manual gate cut is defined as using a knife to cut/release the CDS/intermediate  gates.  LMs  will  ensure  they  hear  and  see  “GREEN  LIGHT”  before manually cutting the CDS/intermediate release gate. (T-2).  LMs are allowed to go aft of the buffer  stop/alternate  forward  barrier  to  manually  cut  the  release  gate.  Exercise  caution  to remain  clear  of  any  bundles  in  the  event  of  an  emergency.  Manual  gate  cuts  may  be performed with CDS loaded into both sides of the CVR, as long as the bundles are released one stick at a time, and the LM has adequate space to remain clear on the opposite side of the exiting  CDS.        WARNING:    Double  stick  CDS  released  simultaneously  is  only  to  be  cut using  the  static-line  retriever.        WARNING:  LM  will  not  cut  release  gates  while  in  the paratroop doors next to the exiting CDS. (T-2). 18.28.  Heavy Equipment Airdrops.  Crews will be thoroughly familiar with both towplate and non-towplate procedures. (T-2).  Only equipment rigged in accordance with 13-C series T.O.s or USSOCOM 350 series may be airdropped. The maximum airdrop load to be extracted over the 200 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 ramp  is  42,000  lbs.  The  aerial  delivery  unit  supporting  the  load  movement  ensures  current publications  are  available  for  LM  reference  during  joint  inspections.  NOTE:  When  conducting HE airdrops LMs should connect their restraint harness to an anchor cable. WARNING: Do not open  the  ramp  and  door  to  accomplish  SATB/simulated  airdrop  with  loads  rigged  with  an extraction/drogue  parachute  in  the  pendulum  release  system.    If  the  actual  airdrop  platform cannot  be  dropped,  the  extraction/drogue  parachute  will  be  removed  the  pendulum  release system and secured forward of the airdrop load. 18.29.  SATB Procedures 18.29.1.  Inspect  all  SATBs  in  the  following  manner:  elongate  the  static  line  and  check  for wear,  ensure  the  pilot  chute  is  attached  with  one  turn  ticket  8/4  cotton  thread  on  all  four corners, ensure bag closing tie is made with a single length of 8/4 cotton thread, and ensure the G-14 clevis is attached to static line. the  following  rigging  sequence:  remove 18.29.2.  The  LM  will  comply  with the transportation tie and activate the bundle marker light (if required). (T-2).  Attach static line to aircraft using a properly rigged G-14 clevis. Clevis may be attached to a locking carabiner and  attached  to  a  floor/ramp  tie-down  ring.  Ensure  the  cotter  pin  on  the  G-14  clevis  is sufficiently bent (approx 45 degrees).  NOTE: LMs may attach a locking carabiner directly to  the  loop  at  the  end  of  the  static  line.  When  an  anchor  cable  is  used  for  static  line attachment, only a G-14 clevis may be used. 18.29.3.  Towed SATB Procedures. If a training bundle is outside and fails to separate, make no attempt to retrieve it. If possible, cut the bundle loose over the pre-briefed salvo area or DZ.  When  using  the  cargo  ramp  and  door,  a  hung  bundle  could  become  wedged  in  the aircraft elevator during turns. If possible, cut the static line prior to making a turn. If at any time the static line may interfere with a flight control surface, immediately cut the static line and notify the crew. If an SATB was rigged in the bomb rack and falls on the ramp, close the ramp and door. Make no attempt to remove the bundle from the ramp prior to ensuring the doors  and  closed  and  locked.  WARNING:  Do  not  open  the  ramp  and  door  to  accomplish SATB/simulated  airdrop  with  loads  rigged  with  an  extraction/drogue  parachute  in  the pendulum  release  system  (aka  the  bomb  rack).    If  the  actual  airdrop  platform  cannot  be dropped, the extraction/drogue parachute will be removed the pendulum release system and secured forward of the airdrop load. 18.30.  JPADS  Airdrops  (I-CDS/I-CRL  and  Guided).  JPADS  operations  are  conducted  using the  JPADS  T-1  aircraft  modification.  Specific  aircraft/aircrew  equipment  includes  the  GPS Retransmission kit (GPS-RTK), UHF Dropsonde Receiver Subsystem (UHF-DRS), the JPADS Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) laptop and software. I-CDS loads are normally rigged CDS loads with non-steerable chutes. JPADS guided operations are conducted using steerable chutes rigged with Autonomous Guidance Units (AGUs). When referenced in this volume, JPADS refers to the aircraft equipment and family of guided and unguided systems. 18.30.1.  Aircrew  Qualification.  JPADS-qualified  PADS  Operators  (POs)  are  authorized  to use  the  JPADS-MP  to  calculate  release  points  for  JPADS/I-CDS/I-CRL,  JPADS  guided combination personnel/equipment, and normal (CDS/CRL) airdrop operations. 18.30.2.  JPADS Alert Procedures. For additional guidance see AFTTP 3-3.HC-130 and AFI 13-217 for amplified information on JPADS DZ and airspace restrictions. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 201 Chapter 19 REFUELING OPERATIONS 19.1.  General:  This  chapter  prescribes  HC-130J  employment  procedures  for  all  refueling operations. For additional guidance and information, refer to AFTTP 3-3.HC-130. 19.2.  HAAR  Operations.  HAAR  operations  are  conducted  IAW  ATP3.3.4.2(C),  T.O.1C-130(H)J-1, and AFTTP 3-1/3.HC-130. 19.2.1.  Minimum HAAR Altitudes. 19.2.1.1.  Training.    Aircraft  will  not  conduct  HAAR  below  1,000  ft  AGL  on  normal training  missions.  (T-2).    Waiver  authority  for  HAAR  down  to  500  ft  AGL  is MAJCOM/A3 or deployed equivalent.  OG/CCs may request standing waivers for local HAAR  tracks  and  recurring  major  exercises  be  included  in  their  supplement  to  this instruction.        NOTE:  Aircraft  will  not  conduct  Low  altitude  HAAR  training  (below 1,000  ft  AGL)  at  tanker  gross  weights  above  130,000  lbs  or  without  a  minimum  three engine climb capability of 500 FPM. (T-2). 19.2.1.2.  Contingency/Combat.  Plan HAAR altitudes as follows: 19.2.1.2.1.  Day  Operations.    Compute  HAAR  altitude  no  lower  than  500  ft  AGL above the highest terrain or obstacle within 1 NM of the air refueling/flight planned track. 19.2.1.2.2.  NVG  Operations.    Compute  HAAR  altitude  no  lower  than  500  ft  AGL above the highest terrain or obstacle within 3 NM of the air refueling/flight planned track.        NOTE:    HAAR  altitudes  below  1,000  ft  AGL  may  be  required  due  to  the threat environment or weather conditions on actual rescue or combat missions.  Final HAAR  altitude  in  no  case  can  be  lower  than  300  ft  above  the  receivers’  minimum enroute altitude capability.    WARNING:  Low altitude HAAR (below 1,000 ft AGL) assumes permissive terrain and is not normally possible at night with unaided vision.  Large  turns  or  course  reversals  below  1,000  ft  AGL  should  be  avoided.    WARNING:    When  operating  at  or  near  minimum  operating  speed,  any  bank  angle could result in a stall without warning. 19.2.2.  ATP3.3.4.2(C), guidance is supplemented as follows: 19.2.3.  HC-130J  aircrew  will  not  use  Rendezvous  (RV)  Altitudes  (AAR  altitude  +  500  ft) under  normal  circumstances  during  rendezvous  operations.  (T-2).    Tankers  conduct rendezvous  and  join-up  operations  at  refueling  altitude  (AAR  altitude)  unless  operational requirements dictate otherwise. 19.2.4.  Either  the  tanker  or  receiver  may  initiate/direct  a  breakaway  when  an  unsafe condition is identified. 19.3.  Tanker Air Refueling. 19.3.1.  Comm  Check.  During  the  communications  check  10  min  prior  to  the  ARCT,  the LM will pass the altimeter to be used for refueling. 19.3.2.  Crew Coordination.  See ATP3.3.4.2(C) for additional guidance. 202 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 19.4.  Receiver  Air-To-Air  Refueling  (AAR).  ATP3.3.4.2(C)  provides  the  basic  guidance  for refueling terminology and procedures. 19.5.  Policy.  The following policies apply to all air refueling conditions regardless of emission control or type of rendezvous: 19.5.1.  AAR  will  only  be  accomplished  by  an  AAR  qualified  pilot,  or  a  pilot  in  training under the supervision of an instructor. (T-2).  Unqualified pilots, undergoing AAR training, must inform the tanker prior to completing any contacts and receive an acknowledgment. (T-2). 19.5.2.  Use manual boom latching procedures only during fuel emergencies and contingency operations.     EXCEPTION:  Manual boom latching procedures are authorized for all AAR operations  with  the  KC-10A  if  the  tanker‘s  independent  disconnect  system  is  operational.  CAUTION:  The  aircraft  commander  will  not  conduct  air  refueling  operations  when  radio communications capability between the tanker and receiver is lost, except during emergency fuel situation. (T-2). 19.5.3.  During aerial refueling missions, the aircraft commander will not onload fuel with an inoperative drain pump. (T-2). 19.5.4.  Do not make any HF radio transmissions or Electronic Counter Measures emissions during AAR operations.   EXEPTION:  ECM expendable patterns approved for use during AAR may be utilized IAW their flight tested parameters. 19.6.  Altitude  Reservations  (ALTRV).  Whenever  practical,  refueling  operations  are  done  on tracks  or  anchor  areas  published  in  DoD  FLIP.    ALTRVs  are  used  when  certain  missions  or operational  considerations  may  require  air  refueling  operations  in  areas  not  published  in  FLIP.  For specific ALTRV procedures, refer to FLIP and FAA Special Military Operations 7610.4H, 3. 19.7.  Hot Refueling Operations 19.7.1.  General.  This  chapter    provides  guidance  for  Hot  Refueling/FARP  for  HC-130J aircraft. The guidance in this chapter supplements the procedures outlined in TO 00-25-172, GROUND  SERVICING  OF  AIRCRAFT  AND  STATIC  GROUNDING/BONDING,  AFI  11-235,  FORWARD  REFUELING  POINT  (FARP)  OPERATIONS,  AFTTP  3-3.HC-130  and checklists.    A  comprehensive  mission  briefing  and  strict  compliance  with  these  procedures ensures an expeditious safe refueling operation. For ACC aircrews, basic hot refueling is the transfer of fuel (refuel or defuel) at sites where all required equipment is provided at that site. Aircrews  qualified  in  hot  refueling  may  refuel/defuel  at  fixed-sites,  refuel/defuel  with approved fuel trucks and receive fuel from a fixed-wing tanker at FARP sites. NVG-qualified aircrews may conduct hot refueling operations under NVG conditions. 19.7.2.  Terms. The following terms are unique to hot refueling operations: 19.7.2.1.  Wet  Wing  Refueling.  Engines  not  running  (power  cart,  GTC,  or  APU  used). The same checklist and procedures apply as for hot refueling. 19.7.2.2.  Tanker  Operations.  The  act  of  providing  fuel  to  a  receiver  source  at  a  hot refueling site. 19.7.2.3.  Receiver Operations. The act of receiving fuel at a hot refueling site. 19.7.2.4.  Fuel Servicing Safety Zone (FSSZ). See AFI 11-235 Glossary for definition. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 203 19.7.3.  Hot  refueling  equipment.  Refueling  aircraft  while  engines  are  running  requires specific  equipment  and  inspections  prior  to  commencing  operations.  Only  equipment approved IAW TO 00-25-172, TO 37A9-7-2-1, and in the system safety engineering analysis (SSEA) shall be used. This equipment is unique in that it provides for an internal bond that is not  provided  for  with  conventional  refueling  equipment.  If  unapproved  equipment  is  used, the refueling operation must be accomplished without engines running (cold refueling). 19.7.3.1.  Necessary  personal  equipment  for  personnel  having  direct  contact  with refueling equipment:. See AFI 11-235 for specific requirements. 19.7.4.  Weather  Requirements.  For  training  operations  and  exercises,  stop  fuel  servicing when high winds or reduced visibility caused by blowing rain, snow, or sand exists or when an  electrical  storm  is  within  a  five  mile  radius  of  the  hot  refueling  site.  For  real  world operations, consider the distance of the storm from the refueling site, direction it is traveling, and its intensity, and use good judgment to determine when to suspend fueling operations. 19.7.5.  Safety. See AFI 11-235 for specific guidance. 19.7.6.  Electronic Emissions. See AFI 11-235 for specific guidance. 19.7.7.  Aircraft Marshaling. See AFI 11-235 for specific guidance. 19.7.8.  Planning  Factors:  Planners  must  be  aware  of  factors  which  limit  hot  refueling employment.  (T-2).    Consider  the  following  when  including  a  hot  refueling  option  in  an exercise or contingency: 19.7.8.1.  Passengers. Personnel and equipment may be off/on-loaded in conjunction with refueling  operations.  Personnel  movement  on  or  off  the  aircraft  should  be  monitored  to maintain accountability in case of an emergency. 19.7.8.2.  Hot refueling sites. Depending on the sister service or host nation there can be several  different  types  of  hot  refueling  sites.  Some  of  the  different  types  of  sites  are  as follows: 19.7.8.2.1.  Forward  Area  Refueling  Equipment  (FARE).  Forward  area  refueling equipment  sites are normally setup  by the Army  using blivets  to  refuel  aircraft. Hot refueling qualified crews may conduct refueling /defueling operation at these sites. 19.7.8.2.2.  Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP). Forward area refueling point sites are  normally  established  for  aircraft  to  aircraft  refueling.  Hot  refueling  qualified crews may conduct receiver operations at these sites.   NOTE: Refueling trucks may conduct refueling/defueling operations to a single aircraft at FARP sites. 19.7.8.2.3.  Hot Refueling Site. Hot refueling site is a generic term used for a site that refuels/defuels aircraft with engines running from a fixed source or a fuel truck. Hot refueling qualified crews may conduct operations at these sites.   WARNING: All hot refueling  sites  will  have  a  current  site  survey  and  meet  the  minimum  unobstructed egress distance required by the survey to ensure the aircraft can taxi from the site in the  event  of  an  emergency.  (T-2).    If  the  egress  distance  is  less  than  the  required minimum  or  the  egress  area  is  obstructed,  tanker/receiver  aircraft  will  perform refueling/defueling in a cold environment only. (T-2). 204 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 19.7.8.3.  Planners must verify equipment at intended Hot Refueling location is approved for use in hot refueling operations. (T-2).  Refer to T.O. 00-25-172, T.O. 37A9-7-2-1 and SSEA for approved equipment. 19.7.9.  Responsibilities. Only current and qualified crewmembers will be allowed to occupy a primary crew position on hot refueling missions.  (T-2).  EXCEPTION: Crewmembers in training  under  the  supervision  of  a  current  and  qualified  instructor.    NOTE:  The  Pilot, Copilot,  and  Combat  Systems  Operator  will  remain  on  the  flight  deck  in  the  event  of  an emergency taxi. 19.7.9.1.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  the  overall  safety  of  the  crew  and  the  aircraft  hot refueling operations. The PIC relies on the LM to announce any unusual situations and to recommend the best course of action. 19.7.9.2.  The Aircraft Commander responsibilities: 19.7.9.2.1.  Ensure  approval  has  been  granted  by  the  proper  authority  prior  to conducting hot refueling operations. 19.7.9.2.2.  Ensure all crewmembers are briefed on their specific responsibilities. 19.7.9.2.3.  Analyze runway availability prior to landing to determine braking action. Unnecessary or heavy braking could delay hot refueling operations. 19.7.9.2.4.  Analyze  planned  hot  refueling  area  for  hazards  and  sufficient  taxi clearances. 19.7.9.2.5.  Determine fuel requirements to include estimated on-load and off-load. 19.7.9.3.  The CSO/CP responsibilities: 19.7.9.3.1.  Control fuel distribution and the SPR drain pump. 19.7.9.4.  Loadmaster  responsibilities:  The  LM  is  responsible  for  supervising  fuel servicing operations. 19.7.9.4.1.  Ensure compliance with all safety procedures. 19.7.9.4.2.  Immediately  inform  the  pilot  and  advise  the  crew  on  recommended course of action, in the event of a hazardous situation/emergency. 19.7.9.4.3.

Voice  communication  contact  between  the  LM  and cockpit will be maintained at all times. (T-2).  The LM does not have to maintain interphone contact  while  positioning/repositioning  refueling  equipment,  but  will  be  on  interphone  any time  the  refueling  nozzle  is  connected  to  the  aircraft  and  the  switches  on  the  Fuel Management Panel are in a position other than off or closed.  (T-2). 19.7.11.  Bonding procedures.  If a ground is not available at a FOL or remote site, aircraft is bonded  to  servicing  equipment  during  actual  servicing.  Bonding  will  be  accomplished  by inserting  the  bonding  plug  into  the  receiver  aircraft’s  external  receptacle  prior  to  any  other action. 19.7.12.  Emergency  Procedures.  Emergency  procedures  are  published  in  the  amplified checklist  contained  within  Attachment  2.  They  will  be  reviewed  by  all  crewmembers  and briefed  by  the  PIC  prior  to  commencing  Hot  Refueling  operations.  (T-2).    All  personnel, including  ground  controllers,  will  know  the  ground  evacuation  plans.  (T-2).    Stop  all  Hot Refueling  operations  immediately  when  a  leak,  unsafe  condition,  or  system  malfunction occurs. Correct the deficiency before resuming hot refueling operations. 19.8.  FARP Operations. running 19.8.1.  General. FARP is a tactical ground refueling operation that can be performed by the HC-130J  with  engines fuel bladders/vehicles. FARP may be used to extend the combat radius/loiter time of the receiver. FARP  is  normally  conducted  at  night  in  austere  environments  with  engines  running  and includes  fuel  transfer  from  aircraft  fuel  tanks  through  the  SPR  panel  or  the  Rapid  Ground Refueling  (RGR)  port  to  the  receiver.  All  equipment  and  personnel  required  to  set-up  the FARP site are assigned to the tanker aircraft. fixed/rotary-wing/tilt-rotor  aircraft  or to  a 19.8.2.  Planning Factors: Planners must be aware of factors which limit FARP employment.  (T-2).  Consider the following when including a FARP option in an exercise or contingency: WARNING:  All  FARP  sites  will  have  a  current  site  survey  and  meet  the  minimum unobstructed egress  distance  required by the survey to ensure the  aircraft  can taxi  from  the site  in  the  event  of  an  emergency.  (T-2).    If  the  egress  distance  is  less  than  the  required minimum  or tanker/receiver  aircraft  will  perform refueling/defueling in a cold environment only. (T-2). the  egress  area is  obstructed, 19.8.2.1.  Units  will  ensure  fire  protection  equipment  is  available  IAW  AFI  11-235, Forward Area Refueling Point Operations, and meets the requirements of TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing and Static Grounding/Bonding. (T-2). 19.8.2.2.  All  Air  Force  personnel  involved  will  be  trained  IAW  appropriate  command directives. (T-2). 19.8.2.3.  Passengers. Personnel and equipment may be on/off-loaded in conjunction with refueling  operations.  Personnel  movement  on  or  off  the  aircraft  should  be  monitored  to maintain accountability in case of an emergency. 19.8.3.  Responsibilities. Only current and qualified crewmembers will be allowed to occupy a primary crew position on FARP missions.   EXCEPTION: Crewmembers in training under the supervision  of a current  and qualified instructor.    NOTE: The Pilot,  Copilot,  and CSO 206 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 will remain on the flight deck in the event of an emergency taxi, i.e. moving the aircraft. (T-2). 19.8.3.1.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  the  overall  safety  of  the  crew  and  the  aircraft  hot refueling operations. The PIC relies on the LM to announce any unusual situations and to recommend the best course of action. 19.8.3.2.  Aircraft Commander responsibilities: 19.8.3.2.1.  Ensure  approval  has  been  granted  by  the  proper  authority  prior  to conducting FARP operations. 19.8.3.2.2.  Ensure all crewmembers are briefed on their specific responsibilities. 19.8.3.2.3.  Analyze runway availability prior to landing to determine braking action. Unnecessary or heavy braking could delay FARP operations. 19.8.3.2.4.  Analyze planned FARP area for hazards and sufficient taxi clearances. 19.8.3.2.5.  Determine fuel requirements to include estimated on-load and off-load. 19.8.3.3.  The Panel Operator (PO) is normally the CSO. PO responsibilties: 19.8.3.3.1.  Control fuel distribution and the SPR drain pump. 19.8.3.4.  Hot Refueling Supervisor (HRS) is the LM. There will be two HRS’s during all FARP  operations.  The  primary  HRS  is  responsible  for  supervising  fuel  servicing operations and ensures that all personnel are properly briefed on fueling procedures.  (T-2).    The  secondary  HRS  will  be  standing  near  the  SPR/RGR  port  to  observe  the  hose connection and be standing by to disconnect the hose in case of an emergency. (T-2). 19.8.3.4.1.  The  HRS  has  a  thorough  knowledge  of  all  equipment  and  systems  and how they operate. 19.8.3.4.2.  Has a thorough knowledge of and observes all safety procedures. 19.8.3.4.3.  Has  a  thorough  knowledge  of  and  follows  the  sequential  steps  for  each operation.    NOTE:    The  HRS  will  ensure  the  right  paratroop  door  remains  open during FARP operations. (T-2). 19.8.3.4.4.  A  HRS  will  position  an  inter-phone  cord  near  the  right  paratroop  door. (T-2).      NOTE:  During  hose  deployment,  the  HRS’s  assists  the  HDP  deploying  the hoses. 19.8.3.4.5.  A  HRS  will  instruct  the  PO  when  to  dispense  or  shut-off  fuel  flow  by interphone, monitor for fuel leaks and periodically scan the tanker wings. (T-2). 19.8.3.4.6.  In the event of a hazardous situation/emergency, a HRS will immediately inform the PO and advise the crew on recommended course of action.  (T-2).   When the FARP operation is complete, the HRS’s assist the HDPs with the tear down of the FARP site and the primary HRS assumes interphone contact. 19.8.3.4.7.  The  HRSs  secure  the  aircraft  for  departure  after  all  equipment  and personnel are aboard. 19.8.3.4.8.  The  primary  HRS  will  brief  whoever  operates  the  ramp  and  door, paratroop door, and canary slides/ground loading ramps. (T-2).  A HRS, upon landing AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 207 and after clearance from the pilot, will open the cargo ramp.  (T-2).    Upon clearance from the pilot to offload the HRS will lower the cargo ramp to the ground. (T-2).  A HRS will exit the aircraft through the ramp and door to perform the hot brake /hung flare checks and to clear personnel off the aircraft to establish the FARP site. (T-2). 19.8.3.4.9.  The primary HRS will be positioned so as to have an unobstructed view of the entire FARP operation. (T-2). 19.8.3.4.10.  Upon  clearance  from  the  primary  HRS,  the  secondary  HRS  and  HDP exits  the  aircraft  and  deploys  the  tanker  end  of  the  refueling  hose  towards  the  SPR panel/RGR port. 19.8.3.4.11.  The  secondary  HRS  monitors  the  refueling  hose  to  prevent  the  HDP from  possibly  damaging  the  hose/connector.  Once  hose  layout  is  complete,  position the  fire  extinguisher  and  water  container  next  to  the  SPR  panel/RGR  port.  The secondary HRS then connects to the prepositioned inter-phone cord.   CAUTION: In the  event  the  aircraft  requires  departure  immediately,  the  PO  must  immediately discontinue  refueling  by  placing  all  the  transfer  pumps,  IFR  pumps,  and  valve switches to the OFF/CLOSED position. (T-2).  The secondary HRS must confirm the SPR Valve/pod supply valve position with the PO to ensure no fuel is pressurizing the hoses prior to disconnecting the SPR nozzle. (T-2).  NOTE:  The HRSs and HDP at each refueling point will perform an on-scene inspection of the pressurized system for leaks, slippage of fuel hoses from hose couplings and general condition of hoses. (T-2).   Hoses that leak or have blistering, saturation or cuts/abrasions which expose the reinforcement material shall be removed from service by the HRS. 19.8.3.4.12.  To drain the residual fuel from the refueling hoses, pressure is relieved from the refueling hose IAW applicable directives.    CAUTION: The secondary HRS disconnects  the  SPR  nozzle  after  confirming  with  the  PO  the  SPR  Valve/pod  fuel valve position to ensure no fuel is pressurizing the hoses. 19.8.3.4.13.  After all hoses have been rolled/stowed to the low (suction) side of the pump, turn the pump off and disconnect the hose. The 10’ section can be evacuated by  use  of  the  SPR  drain  pump  and  holding  the  hose  over  head.  Some  residual  fuel remains in this section of hose. 19.8.3.5.  Hose Deployment Personnel (HDP).  Air Force fuels personnel (AFSC 2FOXl) will  be  included  in  the  FARP  crew  and  deploy/redeploy  fuel  hoses.  (T-2).    Minimum HDPs will be one person for each receiver point. The personnel designated as HDPs will deploy hoses from the aircraft and set up the refueling points. (T-2). 19.8.4.  FARP  Equipment.    See  AFI11-235.  FARP  requires  specific  equipment  and inspections  prior  to  commencing  operations.  HRS  personnel  will  only  use  equipment approved IAW TO 00-25-172, TO 37A9-7-2-1, and in the system safety engineering analysis (SSEA).  (T-2).  This equipment is unique in that it provides for an internal bond that is not provided for with conventional refueling equipment. If unapproved equipment is used, HRS personnel must accomplish the refueling operation without engines running (cold refueling). (T-2). 19.8.5.  Hose Deployment from Aircraft Floor/Ramp. 208 AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 19.8.5.1.  When deploying hoses for a multi-point site, refer to the FARP site survey for proper  positioning  of  equipment.        CAUTION:  Refueling  hoses  should  only  be  pulled from over the shoulder while walking forward, not backwards. 19.8.5.2.  While  deploying  hoses,  after  sufficient  resistance  is  met,  lay  down  hoses  and return to the aircraft for another length. Repeat this step as necessary until positioning is complete. Minimize dragging connections/valves to prevent damage. 19.8.5.3.  When using the RGR port, drag the length of hose towards the SPR panel first to ensure proper slack is available for defueling. 19.8.5.4.  After  positioning  hoses  the  full  distance,  the  nozzle  end  is  brought  back approximately 25 feet  (50 feet  when refueling  fixed wing  aircraft). HDPs will walk  the length of the hoses back to the aircraft checking for kinks, twists, and dry break positions. (T-2). 19.8.5.5.  After HDPs have finished walking the hoses, they will notify the primary HRS with a thumbs up signal that the (dry) line check is complete. (T-2).  HDPs will return to the aircraft for the fire extinguishers and water containers and return to the “X/T” fitting. (T-2).  They then wait for fuel pressurization to the points. 19.8.5.6.  After the hoses are pressurized, the HDPs will perform a leak check taking the water bottle and fire extinguisher along. (T-2).  When the leak check is complete, the fire extinguisher  and  water  container  are  positioned  alongside  the  refueling  nozzle  at  the refueling point.  The HDP will place an infrared chemlight on the water container, then kneel  indicating  the  point  is  ready  for  operation.  (T-2).      NOTE:    If  the  point  becomes non-operational, remove the chemlight from the water container 19.8.5.7.  HDPs  will  remain  at  the  refueling  point  to  act  as  fire  guard  after  passing  the refueling nozzle to the receiver crewmember. (T-2). 19.8.5.8.  Bonding  is  accomplished  by  inserting  the  bonding  plug  from  the  refueling nozzle into the aircraft’s external receptacle prior to any other action. Once the bond has been made, the HDP will not place the hose on the ground or touch the receiver aircraft until the bonding wire is removed. (T-2). 19.8.5.9.  After  the  final  receiver  is  fueled,  the  HDPs  position  themselves  at  each refueling point to drain the hose. When using the RGR port, disconnect the nozzle from the port and attach to the SPR panel before starting to drain hoses.  Stretch hoses to their full  length  and  attach  the  squeegee  to  drain  that  segment  of  hose.    After  running  the squeegee over the length of hose and reaching a connection, close both sides of the valve and disconnect hose.  Install dust caps.  Roll that segment of hose.  Repeat steps for each section of hose.  Return hoses to the aircraft. 19.8.5.10.  Squeegees should  be used to  drain  hoses. When squeegees  are not  available, walking and rolling the hoses suffices as an alternate method of draining. This alternate method  leaves  more  residual  fuel  in  the  hoses  and  increases  tear  down  time  as  well  as hose weight. When reaching the fittings, raise the hose and let fuel drain from the fitting into  the  next  hose,  close  both  valves  while  in  raised  position.  When  reaching  the  cross connection, only close the valve that is designated for the hose you evacuated. AFI11-2HC-130JV3  8 JUNE 2017 209 19.8.6.  Internal  Communications.  During  ground  operations,  communications  can  be difficult due to aircraft noise levels. Interphone discipline is essential so emergency calls may be  relayed  clearly.  All  unnecessary  voice  communication  is  prohibited  for  safety  reasons. Voice communication contact between the loadmaster and cockpit will be maintained at all times. (T-2). 19.8.6.1.  FARP  operations  will  not  be  conducted  if  interphone  contact  cannot  be established  and  maintained  between  the  HRS,  PO,  and  flight  deck  crew.  (T-2).  EXCEPTION: The HRS may clear off interphone to assists the HDPs with the tear down of the FARP site. 19.8.7.  Emergency  Procedures.  Emergency  procedures  are  published  in  the  amplified checklist contained in attachment 2.  They will be reviewed by all crewmembers and briefed to  the  crew  by  the  HRS  prior  to  commencing  FARP  operations.  (T-2).    All  personnel, including ground controllers, will know the ground evacuation plans.  (T-2).  Stop all FARP operations immediately when a leak, unsafe condition, or system malfunction occurs.

Emergency  procedures  are  not  an exact  science.  Common  sense  and  sound  judgment  should  prevail.  However,  crews  should follow  guidelines  during  hot  refueling  operations.  Remember  that  the  LM,  HRS,  and  HDP are the eyes and ears of the crew during all hot refueling operations. Escape routes should be established  for  each  aircraft  in  the  event  of  an  emergency.  The  escape  route  should  be depicted on the hot  refueling site survey  and must be reviewed prior to  the mission. Crews must  monitor  radios  to  ensure  they  receive  any  evacuation  call  and  must be  ready  to  break radio silence and notify other participants in the event they experience an emergency. A2.4.5.1.  The  emergency  signal  for  stopping  fuel  flow  is  arm  and  hand  extended  level with shoulder, palm downward, moving from left to right in front of the body. At night, the same procedure will be used while holding an overt/covert chemlight. 1. Fuel Leak/Spill“EMERGENCY STOP”         Any Crewmember 2.
