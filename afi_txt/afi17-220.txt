Overview. AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 1.1.  Managing  the  Radio  Frequency  (RF)  Spectrum.  International  law,  domestic  law,  and implementing  regulations  require  effective  and  efficient  use  of  the  EMS.  Effective  and efficient use is defined as applying design or operational techniques that conservatively use of the EMS in a compatible (i.e. non-interference) manner. 1.2.  Allocation. The EMS is allocated between federal and non-federal users with portions of the spectrum shared. Federal users must utilize frequency bands allocated for government or shared  use.  A  government  frequency  assignment  may  be  authorized  in  a  non-  government band  provided the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC). is  coordinated  and  granted  approval  by the  request 1.3.  International  Spectrum  Management.  The  International  Telecommunications  Union (ITU) international  frequency  allocations,  worldwide telecommunications standards, and telecommunications development activities. the  body  responsible  for is 1.3.1.  ITU  Membership.  The  United  States  (US)  is  a  member  of  the  ITU.  The  legal framework of the  ITU consists of the  ITU Constitution and Convention,  along  with  the administrative  regulations  that  complement  the  Constitution  and  Convention;  these documents have treaty status and are binding on ITU members. 1.3.2.  Host Nation (HN) Approval. Sovereign nations exercise control over the use of the EMS  within  their  own  territory.  This  basic  consideration  of  international  spectrum management  becomes  extremely  important  when  US  military  forces  operate  abroad.  In nearly all circumstances, it is necessary to obtain HN approval for frequency use before US forces can legally operate any SD equipment in a foreign nation. Failure to obtain HN approval has many serious consequences, including a lack of protection from interference and potential violation of international and local laws (which could lead to fines, seizures of equipment, and ultimately could potentially cause an international incident). 2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 2.1.  Authority. 2.1.1.  US  National  Spectrum  Management.  Title  47  United  States  Code  (USC),  151  et seq.,  The  Communications  Act  of  1934,  (47  USC  151)  established  separate  control  of federal  (government)  and  non-federal  (civilian)  use  of  the  EMS.  The  National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Organization Act (47 USC 901,  et  seq.),  codified  the  NTIA’s  role  as  the  agency  responsible  for  federal  spectrum management.    Non-federal  spectrum  use  is  controlled  by  the  FCC.  Under  this  act,  the only government agencies that assign and control the use of frequencies in the US are the NTIA and the FCC. 2.2.  Organizations. 2.2.1.  NTIA. The NTIA assigns and regulates frequencies for all federal users within the United  States  and  its  Possessions  (US&P).  The  NTIA  governs  all  federal  (including DoD) use of the EMS through the NTIA Manual. 2.2.2.  FCC. The FCC assigns and regulates frequencies for non-federal users within the US&P.  Non-federal  users  include  private  citizens,  companies,  and  state  and  local government users. AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 5 2.2.3.  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  Spectrum  Management.  The  Under  Secretary  of Defense  for  Acquisition,  Technology,  and  Logistics  (USD  [AT&L])  sets  policy  for acquiring  systems  utilizing  the  EMS  and  ensures  compliance  with  EMS  support procedures. The DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) develops overall DoD policy for managing and using the EMS. DoD activities involved in frequency management (see Figure 1.) are: 2.2.3.1.  US Military Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Executive Board  (USMC4EB).  The  USMC4EB,  or  hereafter  “MC4EB”,  develops  joint  policy and provides direction in military communications-electronics (C-E) matters. 2.2.3.2.  The MC4EB Joint Frequency Panel (JFP). The MC4EB JFP provides expert technical advice to the MC4EB in the areas of RF engineering and EMS management. Through the Equipment Spectrum Guidance Permanent Working Group (ESG PWG), it reviews the characteristics of major C-E equipment purchased or developed by the DoD.  This  is  known  as  the  Joint  Frequency  Equipment  Allocation  Process  (also called  the  J/F-12  Process)  and  is  defined  by  requirements  established  by  the  NTIA, Interdepartmental  Radio  Advisory  Committee (IRAC),  Spectrum  Planning Subcommittee (SPS), and military joint or allied system review groups. The MC4EB, through the Frequency Panel’s (FP) Spectrum Operations Permanent Working Group (SOPWG),  establishes  procedures  for  submitting  frequency  assignment  requests according  to  requirements  established  by  the  NTIA,  IRAC,  Frequency  Assignment Subcommittee (FAS), and military joint or allied frequency assignment groups. Figure 1.  DoD Spectrum Management. 2.2.3.3.  DoD  Area  Frequency  Coordinator  (AFC).  The  DoD  AFCs  are  responsible for  ensuring  successful  frequency  coordination  in  the  areas  that  lie  within,  are  6 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 adjacent to, or are within radio line-of-sight (LOS) to any range spectrum dependent system,  including  all  systems  brought  to  a  national  test  range  or  other  designated complex.  Activities  must  coordinate  all  military  frequency  use  within  a  DoD  AFC area  of  responsibility  (AOR)  with  the  appropriate  DoD  AFC  before  starting operations. Attachment 9 details the responsibilities of the AF sponsored DoD AFCs. DoD AFCs obtain administrative support directly  from their parent  major command (MAJCOM)  and  to  the  MC4EB  for  policy  guidance.  The  Allied  Communications Publication  (ACP)  190  (US  SUPP-1(D),  Guide  to  Frequency  Planning,  contains specific  policy  guidance.  Refer  to  the  NTIA  Manual,  Annex  D,  Table  3,  Section 8.3.26,  and  Table  8.3.26  for  a  list  of  the  DoD  AFC  geographic  descriptions, addresses, and phone numbers. 2.2.3.4.

The  HERO  program  encompasses the  establishment  and implementation of explosives safety standards, criteria, instructions, regulations, and electromagnetic  emission  control  procedures  of  EMR  emitters  throughout  the  Air Force. Procedures for HERO certification and management are found in AFI 91-208, Hazards  of  Electromagnetic  Radiation  to  Ordnance  (HERO)  Certification  and Management. 4.  Spectrum Certification. 4.1.  Process and Guidance. Spectrum certification is the statutory process whereby national regulatory  bodies  –  NTIA  and  FCC  for  the  U.S.,  review  telecommunications  systems  for frequency  availability,  electromagnetic  compatibility  (EMC),  and  telecommunications service priority. This process, often referred to as equipment certification, is required for all RF  transmitters  including  COTS  and  non-developmental  items,  unless  specifically  exempt. See  Attachment  3  for  more  details  on  exemptions.  The  successful  completion  of  the certification  process  allows  users  to  request  radio  frequency  assignment  for  each  discrete frequency for certified systems. 4.1.1.  IAW  DoDI  4650.01,  Policy  and  Procedures  for  Management  and  Use  of  the Electromagnetic  Spectrum,  para  4.d.;  and  OMB  Circular  A-11,  section  31.12;  all  using activities,  system  developers,  PMOs,  and/or  acquisition  activities  are  required  to  obtain AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 15 spectrum  guidance  before  submitting  estimates  for  the  development  or  procurement  of major SD systems (including systems employing space satellite techniques). (T-0) 4.1.2.  While  local  purchases  of  SD  systems  through  contracting  offices  or  government credit cards may not require U.S. national regulatory coordination, they must be reviewed by the appropriate spectrum management office to evaluate spectrum supportability prior to the obligation of funds; particularly if the system will be deployed OCONUS. 4.1.3.  All SD systems must meet EMC standards IAW para 4.3.2. 4.2.  Allocation Tables. Frequency allocation tables (NTIA Manual, Chapter 4) provide the guidance for general EMS use both nationally and internationally (each nation that manages their  RF  resources  has  a  national  table).  The  allocation  tables  delineate  proper  use  of  the spectrum by the type of service (i.e., fixed service, aeronautical mobile service, etc.). Every effort should be made to ensure equipment design and use of the EMS by the system is IAW the allocation tables (e.g., planned frequency use matches preexisting station classes in those bands). Specific exemptions can be made for operation outside of designated bands providing that the system be coordinated with the appropriate governing body and proof that the system will cause no harmful interference. Use of non-federal bands must be justified (beyond cost and  convenience)  and  assessed  to  guarantee  non-interference  to  the  current  and  future systems operating in that band. Justification consists of two parts:  1) why the non-allocated frequencies are needed in the first place; and 2) how the system will operate in the requested band(s) without causing harmful interference to systems operating in established services. 4.2.1.  Out-of-Band Operations. 4.2.1.1.  Within the  continental  United  States  (CONUS).  If  an  out-of-band justification is accepted by the NTIA for the system, system certification and use will be on a strict non-interference basis (NIB), not only to systems presently operating in the  established  services,  but  to  any  future  systems  operating  in  established  services that  may  be  certified  at  some  later  date.  Systems  that  do  not  comply  with  the  US Table  of  Frequency  Allocations,  with  an  out-of-band  justification  acceptable  to NTIA,  may  be  permitted  to  operate  on  an  unprotected,  NIB.  Lacking  such justification, programs  should  not  expect  NTIA  certification for such non-compliant systems. 4.2.1.2.  Outside  the  continental  United  States.  Out-of-band  justifications  are  host nation  dependent  and  are  coordinated  via  the  CCMD  responsible  for  that  region  or area of operation. 4.3.  Electromagnetic  Environmental  Effects  (E3).  E3  consists  of  the  specialized  areas  of EMC, EMI, electromagnetic pulse (EMP), electromagnetic vulnerability, lightning, radiation hazards  (RADHAZ),  precipitation  static,  and  electrostatic  discharge.  Consideration  of  all these  various  aspects  of  E3  are  crucial  to  fielding  Air  Force  systems  that  are electromagnetically  compatible  with  each  other  and  the  surrounding  systems  that  must operate  in  the  electromagnetic  environment  (EME).    AF  agencies  and  organizations developing, procuring, or modifying equipment using the EMS must do everything possible to meet applicable international, national, military, and HN EMC standards. Noncompliance may result in the denial of frequency authorization or severe operational restrictions. 16 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 4.3.1.  National EMC. The NTIA establishes EMC standards for all SD systems operating within  the  U.S.  and  its  territories  and  publishes  these  standards  in  the  NTIA  Manual. Penalties for nonconformance are described in Chapter 5, section 5.1.2, “Consequences of  non-conformance  with  the  Provisions  of  this  Chapter”.  However,  in  certain  limited cases where compliance is not technically possible, a temporary waiver may be granted. All  waiver  requests  should  be  routed  through  appropriate  program  and  spectrum management  channels  to  the  AFSMO,  Spectrum  Certification  Division  (AFSMO/SQC) for  further  review  and  consideration  at  the  NTIA.  All  waiver  submissions  must  contain evidence that the SD system is non-compliant with NTIA EMC technical standards and will  not  cause  unintended  or  harmful  electromagnetic  spectrum  interference  (EMI).  A waiver of EMC standards does not constitute authorization to operate. 4.3.1.1.  DoD  EMC.  DoDI  3222.03,  DoD  Electromagnetic  Environmental  Effects (E3)  Program,  establishes  policy  and  responsibility  for  the  management  and implementation of the DoD's EMC and E3 Program, to ensure operational EMC and effective  E3  control  for  all  electronic  and  electrical  systems,  subsystems,  and equipment developed, acquired, and operated by the DoD Components. Additionally, DoDI  4650.01,  Policy  and  Procedures the Electromagnetic  Spectrum  provides  policy  and  guidance that  directs  DoD Components’  spectrum-dependent  system  developers  to  assess  EMC  through  a Spectrum  Supportability  Risk  Assessment  (SSRA);  enclosure  3,  para  2.  Note: Additional information on the AF SSRA process is provided in Attachment 5. for  Management  and  Use  of EMC 4.3.1.2.  DoD (MIL-STD-464), Electromagnetic Environmental Effects Requirements for Systems provides important EMC  and  E3  standards  for  DoD  SD  systems.  All  Air  Force  SD  programs  shall conform to MIL-STD-464. Standards.  Military-Standard-464 4.3.2.  Hazards  of  Electromagnetic  Radiation.  SD  systems  leverage  electromagnetic waves of radiant energy; called spectrum, to carry data, voice, and other information from one place to another as the energy propagates through space. In some cases, such as radar and  x-rays,  we  use  the  electromagnetic  waves  themselves  as  information.  An electromagnetic wave has both electrical and magnetic field components, which oscillate in  a  fixed  relationship  to  one  another,  perpendicular  to  each  other  and  perpendicular  to the direction of energy and wave propagation. Depending on the level of energy and the frequency of the oscillation, these waves can present harmful effects when in contact with certain  reactive  materials  like  fuels,  weapon  systems,  electrical  components,  and  even humans.  Collectively,  this  phenomenon  is  referred  to  as  Hazards  of  Electromagnetic Radiation and all SD system developers must ensure compliance with appropriate DoD, national,  and  applicable  host  nation  EMC  requirements  as  part  of  the  equipment certification  and  SSRA  processes.  DoDI  3222.03,  DoD  Electromagnetic  Environmental Effects (E3) Program, directs DoD Components’ spectrum-dependent system developers, to mitigate the following primary EM radiation hazards: 4.3.2.1.  Hazards  of  Electromagnetic  Radiation  to  Ordnance  (HERO).  Military- Handbook-240  (MIL-HDBK-240),  Hazards  of  Electromagnetic  Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) Test  Guide, describes HERO as a situation in which exposure of ordinance to external electromagnetic environments (EMEs) results in specific safety AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 17 or reliability margins of electrically initiated devices  (EIDs) or electrically powered ordnance firing circuits to be exceeded, or EIDs to be inadvertently actuated. 4.3.2.2.  Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation  to Fuel  (HERF). HERF occurs when EM  radiation  creates  electrical  currents  strong  enough  to  create  electrical  arcs (sparks)  when  an  induced  voltage  exceeds  the  breakdown  voltage  or  flashpoint  of  a surrounding  medium.  These  sparks  can  then  ignite  the  fuel  possibly  leading  to  an explosion.  Air  Force  Safety  (AF/SE)  and  the  Air  Force  Safety  Center  (AFSEC) establishes  and  implements  policy  and  inspection  standards,  in  conjunction  with SAF/CIO  A6,  for  safety  programs  associated  with  the  non-biological  hazards  of EMF-producing systems and equipment, e.g., HERO, HERF. 4.3.2.3.  Hazards  of  Electromagnetic  Radiation  to  Personnel  (HERP).  HERP  is  a situation  in  which  exposure  to  electromagnetic  radiation  causes  harm  to  personnel. Typically,  adverse  biological  effects  of  non-ionizing  (electromagnetic)  radiation  are thermal, resulting from overheating of human body tissue. Overheating results when the body is unable to cope with or adequately dissipate heat generated by exposure to RF energy. AFI 48-109, Electromagnetic Field Radiation (EMFR) Occupational and Environmental Health Program provides minimum occupational health requirements for  an  EMF  health  surveillance  program,  provides  minimum  occupational  health requirements,  for  an  EMF  health  surveillance  program  IAW  DoDI  6055.11, Protecting Personnel from Electromagnetic Fields, requiring personnel  hazard to  be addressed as part of the Air Force acquisition lifecycle. 4.3.2.4.  AFI  91-208,  HERO  Certification  and  Management,  and  AFI  91-203,  Air Force Consolidated Occupational  Safety Instruction, provides Air Force  HERO and HERF  guidance,  while  DoDI 6055.11, provides for  HERP, and should  be consulted as  part  of initial  spectrum-dependent  system  development  and  acquisition.  Compliance with these instructions is mandatory. 4.3.3.  HN EMC Standards.  HN authorities consider HN EMC standards during the DD Form 1494 coordination process. 4.3.3.1.  Application for Equipment Frequency Allocation – “Spectrum Certification”. A principal goal of the DoD’s SM program is to develop and efficiently manage the DoD’s use of the spectrum during the frequency allocation, allotment, and assignment processes.  Achieving  this  goal  minimizes  the  potential  for  interference  during  the fielding  and  employment  of  SD  equipment  in  its  intended  operational  environment. The  spectrum  certification  and  supportability  process  supports  the  DoD’s  SM  goal and is a critical factor due to significant increases in the complexity and use of limited electromagnetic spectrum. 4.3.3.2.  The  application  process  is  closely  aligned  with  the  four  stages  of  the  DoD acquisition  milestones,  where  the  equipment  or  system  program  office  (PO) completes the DD Form 1494 andan EL CID file with radio frequency data for each stage of a systems acquisition lifecycle as it matures from the conceptual through to the operational stage of development. 4.4.  HN  Coordination.  Each  government  has  its  own  rules  for  using  the  spectrum.  US military  use  of  the  spectrum  has  varying  priority  from  nation  to  nation.  Submitters  must 18 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 consider US forces that are garrisoned in other nations and must use equipment on a day-to- day  basis  for  training.  Equipment  that  has  not  obtained  HN  approval  is  not  authorized  for use. This loss of capability can have serious mission impact. The HN coordination process is described  in  more  detail  in  Attachment  4.    Foreign  Forces  operating  within  the  US&P  will follow the guidance as outlined in ACP 190 US SUPP-1(D), Chapter 3, para 306f, Support for HNs Deploying SD Equipment into the US&P. 4.5.  SPS Review.  All major systems (excluding EW) used in the US receive MC4EB review and NTIA certification. AFSMO determines which DD Form 1494 or EL CID files require SPS review. With  the exception of the systems  listed below, goal  systems must go through SPS  review.  NOTE:  As  of  November  1,  2009  all  spectrum  certification  applications submitted to the SPS by AFSMO are required to be in EL CID format. 4.5.1.  New  systems  or  subsystems  and  major  modifications  to  existing  systems, including  all  systems  operating the  space  services  or  radio  determination (radiolocation, radionavigation) services. in 4.5.2.  All  new  systems  or  subsystems  and  major  modifications  to  existing  systems previously  reviewed  by  the  SPS  if  there  is  a  significant  impact  on  the  EMS  when considering geographical location and frequency availability. 4.5.3.  Land mobile radio (LMR) trunked systems. 4.5.4.  Other  systems  or  facilities  that  the  NTIA,  IRAC,  or  other  government  agencies refer to the SPS. 4.5.5.  Systems  referred  for  SPS  submission  by  the  MC4EB  FP  Equipment  Spectrum Guidance (ESG) Permanent Working Group (PWG). 4.6.  Spectrum  Supportability  Risk  Assessment.  Certification  of  spectrum  support  shall  be obtained as required prior to authorization to operate. An integral part of this process is the Spectrum Supportability Risk Assessment (SSRA). SSRA suggested tasks are listed in DoDI 4650.01, Enclosure 3, Table 2, with the detailed process provided in Attachment 5. 5.  Frequency Actions. 5.1.  Frequency  Assignment  Guidance.  All  RF  emitters  must  have  a  frequency  assignment prior to operation. Before making a permanent assignment, the MC4EB must review the RF equipment  via  a  DD  Form  1494J  unless  specifically  exempted  as  noted  in  Attachment  3. Before making a temporary assignment or special temporary authorization, a DD Form 1494 and  EL  CID  file  must  be  submitted  to  AFSMO  and  a  J/F-12  number  assigned.    Frequency assignment parameters must match the technical characteristics of the equipment as listed in the DD Form 1494 or as recommended in the MC4EB guidance page. 5.2.  Types of Frequency Assignments. There are four types of frequency assignments listed in the  NTIA Manual. Descriptions of, and requirements for, these assignments can be found in Section 9.6:  (1) Regular, (2) Temporary, (3) Trial, (4) Group. 5.2.1.  Frequency  Applications.  An  application  is  used  for  the  following  frequency assignment actions (SFAF 010): 5.2.2.  New (N): To apply for a new frequency assignment. AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 19 5.2.3.  Modification (M): Used to apply for the addition, substitution or removal of one or more  of  the  particulars,  except  for  Frequency,  Agency  Serial  Number,  or  Transmitter State/Country,  of  an  existing  frequency  assignment.  No  more  than  60  data  fields  of  an assignment can be modified at one time. If more than 60 data fields require modification submit  either  a  NEW  or  NOTIFICATION  action  using  the  record  replacement  feature described in Section 9.8.2.40 (of the NTIA Manual), or a simultaneous DELETION and NEW or NOTIFICATION action. 5.2.4.  Notification: Used to notify the bringing into use of a frequency by stations under the authority of Section 7.5.2, 7.12, 8.3.11, 9.1.3, or 9.6.5, of the NTIA Manual. 5.2.5.  Renewal  (R):  To  apply  for  the  extension  of  a  TEMPORARY  or  TRIAL assignment and to simultaneously update other particulars of the assignment. 5.2.6.  Deletion  (D):  To  apply  for  the  cancellation  of  a  frequency  assignment  and  the removal  of  all  its  particulars  from  the  Government  Master  File  (GMF)  and  FRRS database. 5.3.  Lead-times.  Lead-times  provide  federal  agencies  and  overseas  commands  and  host countries  with  the  time  necessary  to  coordinate  and  process  applications  for  frequency actions. If the following lead-times are not met, the frequency request must include a mission impact statement if the assignment is not granted by the date requested. Limit such requests to  safety  of  life  or  urgent  matters  of  national  security.  In  all  cases,  requesting  commands must  provide  justification/operational  impacts  statements  when  the  requirement  does  not meet the required lead-time. 5.3.1.  AFSMO lead-times for operations in the US&P. The lead-times below start when AFSMO  receives  the  request  and  does  not  include  time  required  by  the  MAJCOM  or intermediate agencies. 5.3.2.  Regular Assignments. Sixty (60) business days. In most cases, additional lead-time is  required  for  actions  requiring  coordination  with  the  FCC  or  the  FAA.  Requirements that are not IAW the national table of allocations, or have unusual technical parameters, may require additional engineering time or study. It is not uncommon for such requests to take more than six months at the national level. 5.3.3.  Temporary and Group Assignments. Sixty (60) business days. These assignments are described as those temporary assignments  requiring more than 90  calendar days but less than five years for entry into the GMF. Additional lead-time is needed for all actions requiring coordination with the FCC or FAA. Requirements not IAW the national table of allocations, or have unusual technical parameters may require additional engineering time or study, consequently requiring even longer lead-times 5.4.  Exercise  Support.    AFSMO  will  review  and  provide  national  level  coordination  for spectrum  support  prior  to  start  of  the  exercise.    AFSMO  requires  frequency  assignment actions,  operational  data,  and  other  documentation  in  order  to  accomplish  national  level coordination.    Spectrum  Managers  need  to  engage  in  the  earliest  stages  of  the  exercise planning process, see Attachment 10. 20 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 5.4.1.  Exercises which include foreign participants require 150 calendar days for review and  coordination.    Foreign  platforms  will  require  additional  documentation  to  support national level coordination as noted in Annex H, ACP 190 US SUPP-1 (D). 5.4.2.  Exercises with only US exercise participants require 120 calendar days for review and coordination. 5.4.3.  For operations outside the US&P. Unified commands set lead-times for frequency actions  based  on  agreements  with  host  governments.  Generally,  theater  CCMD  JFMOs require  a  minimum  of  ninety  (90)  business  days  lead-time  to  process  overseas requirements. The 90-day time starts when the CCMD JFMO receives the request. Refer to theater instructions for specific lead-times. 5.5.  Frequency Coordination. The DoD does not own spectrum exclusively for military use. In fact, spectrum is not owned by any organization, it is “allotted” and assigned. The DoD, through  the  Military  Assignment  Group  (MAG),  manages  the  spectrum  between  225  MHz through 328.6 and 335.4 MHz through 399.9 MHz for the federal government (NTIA). When it  is  necessary  for  the  AF  to  use  frequencies  managed  by  another  federal  department  or agency, the AF must coordinate with the appropriate agency prior to submitting a frequency request to the NTIA for assignment action. Coordinate frequency actions as outlined in paras 5.5.1  through  5.5.9  and  include  a  statement  of  completed  coordination  and  comments  with the frequency action. 5.5.1.  FCC.  Refer  to  the  NTIA  Manual  for  the  civil  frequency  bands  requiring coordination. AFSMO completes final coordination with the FCC national office before submitting the request to the FAS for assignment action. 5.5.2.  FAA.  The  FAA  manages  certain  frequency  bands  through  the  Aeronautical Assignment Group (AAG), a working group of the FAS. Coordination with HQ FAA is required  for  all  new  and  existing  assignment  modifications  with  changes  in  technical parameters. AFSMO, a member of the AAG, completes final coordination with the AAG before submitting the request to the FAS for assignment action. 5.5.2.1.  FAA coordination procedures are detailed in Attachment 8. Utilize the FAA Web  Frequency  Coordination  Request  (WebFCR)  site  to  process  assignment proposals for FAA managed frequency bands.  Place FAA coordination number and notes in SFAF item 520. 5.5.2.2.  If  after  three  attempts  to  coordinate  and  two  inquiries  with  the  FAA  via WebFCR,  add  the  following  in  SFAF  item  520:  “Attempted  coordination  and inquiries  with  HQ  FAA  on  (list  dates)  have  failed.”  Process  this  SFAF  through AFSMO. 5.5.3.  DoD  AFC.  Coordinate  frequency  actions  at,  among,  and  within  radio  LOS  of ranges according to NTIA Manual, para 8.3.26, Table 8.3.26 and Annex D. 5.5.4.  Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council (AFTRCC). Coordinate all frequency requirements that fall within the 1435-1525 and 2360-2395 MHz band with the appropriate  AFC  prior  to  submission.  The  AFC  coordinates  with  the  AFTRCC coordinator. AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 21 5.5.5.  Army. Coordinate all AF frequency requirements on an Army installation with the appropriate Army frequency coordinator prior to submission. 5.5.6.  Navy.  Coordinate  all  AF  frequency  requirements  on  a  Navy  installation  with  the appropriate Navy frequency coordinator prior to submission. 5.5.7.  Canadian  border.  Coordination  prior  to  assigning  frequencies  is  required  with Canada  within  80  kilometers  (km)  (approximately)  of  the  US/Canadian  border  for terrestrial  communications  requirements  and  250  nautical  miles  (nmi)  for  aeronautical communications frequency  proposal requirements with Canada.  Refer to the NTIA Manual for specific guidance. requirements.  The  NTIA  coordinates the 5.5.8.  Mexican  border.  Coordination  prior  to  assigning  frequencies  is  required  with Mexico  within  75  km  (approximately)  of  the  US/Mexican  border  for  terrestrial communications for  aeronautical communications  requirements.  The  NTIA  coordinates  the  necessary  requirements  with Mexico.  Refer to the NTIA Manual for specific guidance. requirements  and  250  nmi (approximately) 5.5.9.  Outside  US&P.  MAJCOMs  coordinate  frequency  actions  according  to  theater policies and procedures through the appropriate AF component command. 5.6.  Frequency Application and Approval Channels. 5.6.1.  AF Organizations in the US&P. 5.6.1.1.  Installation  Spectrum  Manager.  The  ISM  is  responsible  to  the  installation commander for managing all frequency use on the installation and outlying sites/areas under  the  control  of  the  installation  commander.  Therefore,  all  units/organizations assigned  to  the  installation  submit  their  frequency  applications/requirements  to  the ISM. The ISM will: 5.6.1.1.1.  Submit proposals for host installation units to the host MAJCOM. (T-2) 5.6.1.1.2.  Submit  proposals  for  tenant  units  supporting  the  host  installation mission to the host’s and tenant’s MAJCOMs respectively. 5.6.1.1.3.  Submit  proposals  for  tenant  units  not  supporting  the  host  installation mission to the supported unit’s MAJCOM with a copy to the host and tenant unit MAJCOMs, e.g., as described below: 5.6.1.1.3.1.  Submit  frequency  requirements  for  a  HQ  ACC  maintenance expediter  net  on  a  Headquarters  Air  Mobility  Command  (HQ  AMC) installation to HQ ACC with a copy to HQ AMC. 5.6.1.1.3.2.  Submit  frequency  requirements  for  a  HQ  AFMC  unit  in  support of HQ ACC on a HQ AMC installation to HQ ACC with a copy to HQ AFMC and HQ AMC. 5.6.1.2.  ANG and Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC) units will: 5.6.1.2.1.  Submit actions to support day-to-day operations, training requirements, fixed Air Traffic Control (ATC), and navigational  aids  (NAVAIDs) at  operating bases  and  permanent  training  sites,  through  appropriate  channels  to  the  ANG Readiness  Center  (ANGRC)  or  HQ  AFRC,  respectively.  The  ANGRC  or  HQ 22 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 AFRC sends the actions to AFSMO. 5.6.1.2.2.  Submit requests in support of exercise or readiness inspections through the tasking agency to AFSMO. 5.6.1.2.3.  The  ANG  units  will  submit  actions  to  support  state-levied  mission requirements  through  their  State  Level  Joint  Force  Headquarters  (JFHQ-J6 Spectrum  Manager’s  Office)  for  action,  then  route  to  National  Guard  Bureau (NGB)  (HQ  ANG-A6  Operations)  for  necessary  adjudication.  The  Adjutant General (TAG) endorses JFHQ-J6 Spectrum Manager Directives and routes them to FCC Safety and Special Radio Services Bureau. 5.6.1.3.  Military Affiliate Radio System (MARS) activities: 5.6.1.3.1.  Submit  actions  for  MARS  very  high  frequency  (VHF)  nets  on  a military installation or on outlying locations hosted by an installation through the host ISM to the host MAJCOM. MAJCOMs coordinate with the 38th Cyberspace Readiness Squadron (38 CYRS/SCM), 203 West Losey Street, Room1200, Scott AFB  IL 62225-5222 to  ensure the net  is  authorized before sending the  action to AFSPC who in turn will submit to AFSMO. 5.6.1.3.2.  Civilian  affiliate  stations  send  frequency  actions  to  the  state  MARS director.  The  state  MARS  director  sends  actions  to  the  region  communications manager, who, in turn, sends it to the Chief, USAF MARS (38 CYRS/SCM), 203 W.  Losey  St.  Rm.  1200,  Scott  AFB,  IL  62225-5222.  If  approved,  the  Chief, USAF MARS sends the frequency action through AFSPC to AFSMO. 5.6.1.3.3.  The Chief, USAF MARS and AFSPC coordinate High Frequency (HF) actions.  HF  assignments  are  made  on  a  regional  basis.  The  authority  for  station operation  is  found  in  AFI  17-210,  Radio  Management.    No  formal  action  is required. 5.6.1.4.  Civil Air Patrol (AFAUX/CAP). The CAP is an auxiliary of the AF under 10 USC 9441, et seq, Civil Air Patrol. AFI 10-2701, Organization and Function of the Civil  Air  Patrol,  outlines  AF  support the  AFAUX/CAP.  Per  SECAF Organizational Change Request, 10 May 2016, ACC assumed responsibility for CAP. CAP  units  will  submit  frequency  actions  that  support  AF  operations  and  training, whether in whole or in part, to AFAUX/CAP National Headquarters (AFAUX/CAP-DOSF),  105  South  Hansell  Street,  Maxwell  AFB  AL  36112-6332.  AFAUX/CAP National  Headquarters  sends  the  frequency  actions  to  HQ  ACC/A6CF,  who  in  turn, sends them to AFSMO. to 5.6.1.4.1.  AFSMO  may  assign  AFAUX/CAP  frequencies  for  AF  units  to communicate with the AFAUX/CAP during operational missions. 5.6.1.4.2.  AF units may allow AFAUX/CAP to use their assigned frequencies to communicate with other AF units during operational missions. 5.6.1.4.3.  AFAUX/CAP  units  give  the  ISM  a  list  of  frequencies  used  on  the installation. 5.6.1.4.4.  AFSMO  will  maximize  the  use  of  regional  and  the  US&P  frequency assignments to meet AFAUX/CAP spectrum requirements and registration in the AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 23 GMF. Exceptions will encompass requirements,  which require GMF registration as defined or  required by  the NTIA for management of spectrum use in the US, most notably, stations within border zone areas (Canada and Mexico), on federal real estate, at civil airports and stations in proximity to high-density metropolitan or  military  area  facilities.    Other  location  specific  stations  operating  under  the auspices of regional or US&P assignments will be registered in FRRS. 5.6.2.  AF  Organizations  Outside  the  US&P.  Overseas  units  submit  frequency  requests according  to  unified  command  policy.  The  geographical  CCMD  is  responsible  for military use of frequencies within the command’s geographical area. 5.7.  Contractor Use of Frequencies. 5.7.1.  AF Contracts. Contractors must submit frequency requests in direct support of AF contracts  through the AF representative  (normally the  ISM if on an AF  base or if  at  an Acquisition Center, the PO responsible for the contract), to the MAJCOM responsible for administering  the  contract.  Include  in  the  SFAF  Item  520,  Supplemental  Details, associated contract  number (s), AF POC, and expiration date of the contract.   Note, the contractor  must  obtain  frequency  assignments  from  the  FCC  for  requirements  not  in direct support of the contract.  These licenses/assignments should be entered into FRRS. 5.7.2.  Multiple Service Contracts. Contractors must submit frequency requests in support of a multiple service contract through the appropriate spectrum management channels to the military department that is the executive service for the contract. The contractor must obtain frequency assignments from the FCC for requirements not in direct support of the contract. 5.7.3.  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS),  Direct  Commercial  Sales  (DCS),  and  Hybrid programs.  If the intention is  to  radiate  within the US&P, requirements must  go through the US&P process (i.e., certification and assignment). However, Hybrid programs will be handled case-by-case. 5.8.  Shared-Use  Facilities.  Shared-use  facilities  as  defined  by  the  NTIA  is  a  radio  system using one or more frequencies authorized by the NTIA and one or more frequencies licensed by the FCC. Shared systems may be authorized IAW conditions described in Section 8.2.47, Shared Federal/Non-Federal Radio Systems, of the NTIA manual. 5.9.  Joint Bases. With the implementation of Joint Bases throughout DoD, the following is provided for those AF units designated as the lead service to provide spectrum management support  for  a  Joint  Base.  Table  1  lists  all  of  the  locations  currently  affected  by  the  Joint Basing  program  and  the  identified  lead  service  designated  to  provide  overall  spectrum management support for those locations:   24 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 Table 1.  Joint Base Locations. Joint Base Installations Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI Joint Region Marianas, Guam Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, DC Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, VA Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, VA Joint Base Charleston, SC Joint Base Andrews-Naval Air Facility Washington, MD Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, AK Joint Base San Antonio, TX Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, NJ Joint Base Langley-Eustis, VA Lead Service Navy Navy Navy Navy Army Army Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force Air Force 5.9.1.  The Lead Service will designate a spectrum management office (SMO) to provide SM support of the Joint Base EME. The Military Services will ensure that the Joint Base SMO is cognizant of their SD equipment/systems within the boundaries of the Joint Base and the operators of any SD devices obtain and maintain frequency assignments for those systems. 5.9.1.1.  The  Joint  Base  SMO  will  process  Joint  Service  temporary  and  permanent frequency actions through established channels. 5.9.1.2.  In Joint Base environments, the Services are responsible to: 5.9.1.2.1.  Pre-coordinate  all  temporary  and  permanent  frequency  proposals  with the Joint Base SMO prior to submission to the national level for processing. 5.9.1.2.2.  Conduct  periodic  reviews  of  their  frequency  assignments  and  pre- coordinate  updated  information  with  the Joint  Base  SMO  prior  to  submission  to the national level for further processing. 5.9.1.2.3.  Obtain  an  approved  equipment  certification  prior  to  submitting  any frequency proposal. Equipment certification is obtained using the EL CID, via the NTIA SPS process. 5.10.  Frequency  Assignment  Review  Program.  Each  responsible  Air  Force  entity;  i.e. MAJCOM, NAF, Center, Wing, etc., and user shall maintain a program of continuing review of assigned radio frequency assignments for its radio stations and shall delete or amend such assignments  as  appropriate.  The  objectives  of  this  program  are  a)  to  ensure  that  frequency assignments are in current use and are correctly reflected in the DoD FRRS and the GMF, b) to  ensure  that  frequency  assignments  are  required  for  continued  operations  for  the  purpose stated in their justification, and c) to ensure that frequency assignments are still qualified for authorization  under  the  provisions  of  the  regulations  contained  in  the  NTIA  Manual  and subsequent DoD and AF policy. Each assignment shall be reviewed in a manner specified in Attachment 7 and IAW the NTIA Manual, Annex F. (T-0) 5.11.  Non-licensed Devices. A non-licensed device is a low power intentional, unintentional, or incidental radiator or device that conforms to the technical criteria found in the FCC rules, 47 U.S.C., Part 15 or Annex K, NTIA Manual.  There are provisions in Sections 7.8 and 7.9 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 25 and  Annex  K  of  the  NTIA  Manual  that  allow  federal  agencies  to  operate  systems  that conform to the FCC’s rules in 47 CFR Part 15 (which are incorporated into Annex K of the NTIA Manual) on a non-licensed, non-interference basis. Non-licensed devices are afforded no  protection  from  interference;  if  interference  is  caused  to  an  authorized  service  the  non-licensed device must cease operation. Because of this, AF activities must exercise caution in procuring  and  using  non-licensed  devices.  Examples  of  non-licensed  devices  are  wireless local  area  networks,  wireless  microphones,  and  cordless  telephones.  Using  activities  are strongly  advised  not  to  use  non-licensed  devices  for  critical  command  and  control applications  essential  for  mission  success,  protection  of  human  life,  or  high  value  assets. Frequency  registration  will  be  coordinated  at  the  local  spectrum  management  level  and documented in the FRRS when the device directly supports an AF mission. 5.12.  Frequencies Not Requiring Specific Assignment. International distress and emergency frequencies do not need specific assignments for use. Table 6.2 lists frequencies not requiring assignment for use in the US&P. Outside the US&P, theater commanders and HNs determine frequencies that do not need specific assignment. 5.13.  Emergency  Frequency-Sharing  Notification.  Under  emergency  conditions,  several government agencies (i.e., Federal Emergency Management Agency operations) may operate on, or near, frequencies assigned to AF organizations. When this occurs, one of the involved agencies  should  coordinate  with  the  affected  AF  organization  to  arrange  frequency  sharing during  the  emergency.  AF  units  will  cooperate  fully  during  emergencies  unless  frequency sharing would jeopardize mission-essential operations. To properly coordinate at the national level, a representative for the local AF units must up-channel the information concerning the emergency  situation.  Ideally,  this  information  should  flow  through  command  channels  to notify AFSMO. 5.14.  Air  Force  Spectrum  Interference  Resolution  (AFSIR)  Program.  EMI  is  any  EM disturbance  that  interrupts,  obstructs,  or  otherwise  degrades  or  limits  the  effective performance  of  electronics  and  electrical  equipment.  It  can  be  induced  intentionally,  as  in some  forms  of  EW,  or  unintentionally,  as  a  result  of  spurious  emissions  and  responses, intermodulation  products,  and  the  like.  The  AFSIR  program,  discussed  in  AFI  17-221, contains guidance for units experiencing EMI that must be resolved on a case-by-case basis. The 85th Engineering Installation Squadron (85EIS), Keesler AFB, MS can provide technical assistance to AF units to resolve interference. Units that experience interference and require on-site assistance may request Quick Fix Interference Reduction Capability assistance IAW AFI 17-221. 6.  Guidance for Specific Cases of Frequency Usage. 6.1.  General.  This  chapter  lists  permissible  frequency  usage  within  the  US&P.  Unless otherwise noted, frequency assignments are necessary for the specific frequencies. 6.2.  Non-Licensed/Annex  K  Devices.  The  Purchase  and  Use  of  Federal  and  FCC  Non-Licensed Devices is outlined in Section 7.8 of the NTIA Manual. The following AF caveats and warnings apply: 6.2.1.  AF  activities  should  not  use  non-licensed  equipment  for  critical  tactical  or strategic  command  and  control  applications  essential  for  mission  success,  protection  of human life, or protection of high-value assets, as they offer no protection of spectrum use 26 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 in  support  of  operational  requirements.  Non-licensed  devices  operate  on  a  non-interference  basis,  which  includes  accepting  any  interference  from  any  federal  or  non-federal  authorized  radio  station,  other  non-licensed  device,  or  industrial,  scientific,  and medical equipment. 6.2.1.1.  Upon  notification  by  cognizant  spectrum  management  personnel  that  the device is causing interference, the operator of the non-licensed device shall cease all radiation from the device until it can be proven that further use will no longer cause interference. 6.2.1.2.  Users  will  not  modify,  modernize,  enhance,  or  change  the  equipment’s power, antenna, waveform, or information transfer characteristics in any manner that would  cause  it  to  violate  the  NTIA  criteria  for  non-licensed  devices  or  the  device’s FCC type certification. 6.2.2.  US&P  Operations.  Unmodified  non-licensed  devices  (i.e.,  devices  meeting  the standards  in  47  CFR  Part  15  as  incorporated  into  Annex  K  of  the  NTIA  Manual) operating  within  the  US&P  do  not  require  NTIA  certification  or  an  approved  NTIA frequency  assignment.  However,  the  AF  requires  a  frequency  assignment  registered  in the FRRS and a DD Form 1494 coordinated with the ESG PWG for information purposes only. 6.2.3.  Outside  US&P  Operations.  Theater  commanders  and  HNs  decide  if  frequency support is available and the requirements for frequency assignments.  Users must submit a  DD  Form  1494  through  the  supporting  spectrum  manager  for  equipment  that  radiates and will be deployed outside the US&P. After obtaining HN approval, users may request frequency assignments. US non-licensed devices require HN approval to operate. 6.2.4.  Use  of  Ionospheric  Sounders.  Reference  Section  8.2.21  of  the  NTIA  Manual.  In addition  to  the  minimum  information  required  in  the  sounder  frequency  assignment request,  the  SFAF  will  include  the  following:  pulses  per  channel,  sweep  rates,  sweep intervals,  pulse  width  (duration),  pulse  repetition  rate  (PRR),  antenna  type,  antenna orientation,  and  the  statement,  “No  existing  authorized  ionospheric  sounder  system  is capable  of  meeting  this  requirement.”  Also,  include  on  line  SFAF  500,  special  note  - S383. 6.2.5.  Chirpcomm.  Chirpcomm  is  a  low  power,  highly  reliable  message  transmission capability  system  used  in  conjunction  with  sounders.  The  system  sends  nonsecure narrative  messages  up  to  38  characters,  with  a  two  character  transmit  station  identifier. This  subsystem  supplements  and  sustains  existing  HF  communications  circuits  by enhancing the sounder capability. However, EMC differs significantly from the sounder-only  mode.  You  must  consider  potential  interference  to  other  HF  circuits  and  meet  the following conditions: 6.2.5.1.  US  military  Chirpcomm  systems  are  authorized  only  for  critical  or contingency requirements when standard methods of communication are not feasible. 6.2.5.2.  Obtain specific frequency assignments for the Chirpcomm mode in addition to those for the chirpsounder. 6.2.5.3.  AFSMO coordinates Chirpcomm systems within the US&P with the NTIA. AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 27 6.3.  AF  Considerations  for  use  of  HF  systems  in  the  CONUS.  To  insure  sufficient frequencies  will  be  available  for  the  operation  of  radio  circuits  essential  to  the  national security and defense and to conserve frequencies below 30 MHz for services which cannot be operated  adequately  without  them,  AF  activities  will  adhere  to  the  regulations  contained  in Section 8.2.11 of the NTIA Manual. 6.4.  VHF  Air/Ground  (30-50,  118-136,  138-144  MHz).  VHF  air-to-air  and  air-to-ground communications supports both ATC and tactical operations. 6.4.1.  VHF  ATC.  VHF  ATC  operations  are  conducted  in  the  118-136  MHz  band.  The AAG controls the use of these frequencies. The FAA considers normal ATC operations at a location to consist of:  one ground control, one local control, two approach controls, one departure  control,  and  one  Automatic  Terminal  Information  Service  (ATIS),  and Automated  Surface  Observation  System  (ASOS)/Automated  Weather  Observation System  (AWOS).  NOTE:  If  additional  frequencies  are  required,  justification  must  be provided  in  SFAF  Item  520.  This  justification  will  be  considered  by  HQ  FAA  to determine the need for the additional frequencies. All requirements must be coordinated via FAA WebFCR. A service volume must be included on all ATC assignments (SFAF Item  503).  FAA  coordination  information  must  be  listed  in  the  Notes  Free-  text Comments  (SFAF  Item  501)  as  a  M018  note.  Additionally,  in  certain  RF  saturated regions  not  all  normal  ATC  operations  can  be  supported  with  a  FAA  VHF  band assignment. 6.4.2.  VHF Tactical  Operations. VHF tactical  operations are normally conducted in  the 30-50 or the 138-150 MHz bands. 6.4.3.  VHF Pilot to Dispatch. This function cannot reside in the 108-136 MHz frequency band. Place this function into the band of 138-150 MHz. Use 139.3 MHz when feasible, to standardize AF operations. 6.5.  Ultra High Frequency (UHF) (225-399.9 MHz). The 225-399.9 MHz band, referred to as  the  UHF  band,  supports  fixed,  mobile,  aeronautical  radionavigation,  and  satellite operations. Assignments to support the various functions must be IAW the channeling plan. The following are various AF functions supported in the 225-399.9 MHz band: 6.5.1.  Aeronautical  Operations.  Within  the  US&P,  the  MAG  recommends  assignment action  used  to  support  aeronautical  operations.  Frequencies  are  channeled  in  25  kHz increments and must be used IAW the USMC4EB-M-002-12, 225-399.9 MHz allotment plan. The use includes both air-to-air and air-to-ground operations. Typical uses include ATC,  squadron  operations,  etc.  When  processing  assignment  requests  for  aeronautical operations, a service range and height must be included. 6.5.1.1.  Air-to-Air  Refueling.  All  frequencies  used  for  air-to-air  refueling  must contain the track number, exit and entry points on the track, and the names of the sites with the track geographical coordinates. 6.5.1.2.  ATC Frequencies. ATC frequencies are used solely to control the movement of  aircraft.  ATC  services  include  approach  control,  departure  control,  clearance delivery,  enroute  control,  ground  control,  and  local  control.  The  AAG  controls  all frequencies  used  for  ATC  and  must  coordinate  prior  to  an  assignment  being  made. ATC  communications  support  is  provided  by  military  and  civilian  FAA  certified 28 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 facilities  in  direct  support  of  the  National  Airspace  System  (NAS)  and  conducted under  a  MOU  between  the  facility  and  FAA.  Coordination  is  required  via  FAA WebFCR for all ATC requirements. 6.5.1.2.1.  Communications  between  military  stations  and  aircraft  operating within a military operating area, after being handed over by FAA control, are not considered ATC operations. 6.5.2.  Wideband  Operations.  Any  bandwidth  greater  than  12.5  kHz  is  considered  a wideband  requirement.  Frequencies  used  must  conform  to  the  designated  wideband allotments in the UHF allotment plan. 6.5.2.1.  Fixed  Multichannel  Radio  Relay.  Fixed  multichannel  radio  relay  is  not permitted  to  operate  in  this  band  within  the  US&P,  except  for  tactical  exercises  or training,  or  unless  demonstrated  that  its  use  is  the  only  effective  way  to  satisfy  a communications  requirement.  Multichannel  radio  relay  is  normally  a  duplex operation; therefore, make sure frequencies are requested for both locations. 6.5.3.  Satellite  communications.  The  225-399.9  MHz  band  is  used  to  support  military satellite  communications.  Per  USMC4EB-M-002-12,  Allotment  Plan  for  the  225-399.90000  MHz  Frequency  Band,  Annex  D  provides the  plan  for  satellite communications. 6.6.  NAVAID Frequencies. NAVAIDs help provide safe and efficient operation of civil and military aircraft. All frequency assignments for NAVAIDs are under the control of the AAG and require HQ FAA coordination except the long-range aid to navigation (LORAN) system. There  are  many  radio  frequencies  used  to  support  airfield  operations  at  a  typical  AF installation.  Periodically,  the  ISM  should  compare  assigned  frequencies  against  the  DoD flight  information  publications  (FLIP).  Errors  should  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  the airfield  manager  so  the  FLIP  can  be  corrected,  or  frequencies  changed  to  those  assigned. Aeronautical NAVAIDs and their allocated frequency bands are: 6.6.1.  Low  Frequency  (LF)  and  Medium  Frequency  (MF)  Non-Directional  Beacons (NDB). Frequencies for LF or MF radio beacon operations range from 70 to 2000 kHz. AF NDBs normally operate in the 200-415 and 510-535 kHz band within the US&P. A Station Class of ALB, emission of 2K04A2A, and service volume (SFAF Item 503) are required for each proposal. 6.6.2.  Instrument Landing System (ILS). The ILS consists of three components: marker beacon,  localizer,  and  glideslope.  The  ILS  provides  guidance  for  an  aircraft  on  final approach to a runway. The runway number that the ILS will service must be documented in the frequency assignment. 6.6.2.1.  Marker Beacon. The marker beacon operates on a standard frequency of 75 MHz.  The  marker  beacon  indicates  a  specific  location  along  the  final  instrument approach.  Station Class:  ALA; Emission 6K00A2A. 6.6.2.2.  Localizer.  The  localizer  operates  in  the  108.1-111.95  MHz  band  and transmits  horizontal  guidance  signals  to  direct  the  aircraft  to  the  runway  centerline. The localizer also transmits a Morse code airfield identifier consisting of the letter "I" followed  by  a  Runway  number  (SFAF  Item  503)  and  NAVAIDS  Identifier  (SFAF AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 29 Item  304)  that  must  be  included  in  the  proposal.  Station  Class:  ALL;  Emission 2K04A1A (without voice). 6.6.2.3.  ILS  Glideslope.  The  frequency  band  328.6-335.4  MHz  transmits  vertical guidance  signals  for  descent  to  the  runway.  The  Glideslope  is  allocated  for aeronautical  radionavigation  and  is  used  to  support  ILS  Glideslope.  Glideslope  and localizer frequencies are paired according to the channeling plan shown in the NTIA Manual. The AAG controls these assignments. Coordination is required with the FAA via WebFCR for all ATC requirements. 6.6.3.  Microwave  Landing System (MLS). The  MLS operates in  the 5031-5090.7 MHz band and is the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) approved replacement for  the  current  ILS  system.  The  MLS  is  based  on  time-referenced  scanning  beam, referenced  to  the  runway,  allowing  aircraft  to  determine  precise  azimuth  angle  and elevation angle. The FAA engineers support the MLS and associated precision Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) operating in the band 972-1143 MHz. 6.6.3.1.  Mobile Microwave Landing System (MMLS). The AN/TRN-45 is a tactical military  precision  approach  and  landing  system  that  is  compatible  and interoperable with the national and international MLS systems. It is designed as a tactical landing guidance  for  military  aircraft  and  provides  azimuth,  elevation  data,  and  range information at off-base landing sites. The AN/TRN-45 has two transmitters. The first transmitter is in the 979-1143 MHz frequency range and is used for DME. A second transmitter is in the 5031-5090.7 MHz frequency range and is used to transmit data, azimuth,  and  elevation  as  specified  by  the  ICAO.  Coordination  is  required  with  the FAA via WebFCR as they engineer the frequency support for MMLS systems. This system is highly transportable as it is deployed to off-base landing sites. 6.6.4.  Tactical  Air  Navigation  (TACAN).  The  TACAN  provides  short-distance  range and  azimuth  information  to  the  aircraft.  The  TACAN  system  consists  of  an  airborne interrogator operating in the 1025-1150 MHz band and a ground transponder operating in the  962-1024  MHz  or  1151-1213  MHz  band.  In  some  cases  the  transponder  is  on  an airborne  platform.  This  configuration  is  referred  to  as  air-to-air  TACAN.  This configuration  is  used,  for  example,  during  air  refueling.  The  band  962-1024  MHz  is referred  to  as  low  band  and  1151-1213  MHz  is  referred  to  as  high  band.    This  is important  when  supporting  tactical  equipment  because  many  systems  have  a  low  band antenna  and  a  high  band  antenna;  therefore,  know  which  is  in  use  in  order  to  request frequency  supportability.  When  making  assignments  normally  only  the  ground  transmit frequency  (SFAF  Item  110)  is  assigned  and  its  paired  airborne  frequency  is  assumed. TACANs are classified into three categories depending on their operational use: terminal facility, local enroute facility, or high enroute facility. The classification of the facility is important because it determines the level of protection afforded the facility. The standard service volume (SSV) (SFAF Item 503) is required on all assignments. 6.6.4.1.  SSV.  Ground  stations  are  classified  according  to  their  intended  use.  These stations are available for use within their service volume. Outside the service volume, reliable  service  may  not  be  available.  For  standard  use,  the  airspace  boundaries  are called SSVs. They are defined in Table 2 for the three station classes. 30 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 Table 2.  Standard Service Volume SSV Class Designator  Altitude and Range Boundaries T (Terminal) L (Low Altitude) H (High Altitude) From 1000 feet (305 m) above ground level (AGL) up to and including 12,000 feet (3,658 m) AGL at radial distances out to 25 nmi (46 km). From 1000 feet (305 m) AGL up to and including 18,000 feet (5,486 m) AGL at radial distances out to 40 nmi (74 km). From 1000 feet (305 m) AGL up to and including 14,500 feet (4,420 m) AGL at radial distances out to 40 nmi (74 km). SSV Class Designator  Altitude and Range Boundaries   From 14,500 feet (4,420 m) AGL up to and including 60,000 feet (18,299 m) at radial distances out to 100 nmi (185 km).  From 18,000 feet (5,486) AGL up to and including 45,000 feet (13,716 m) at radial distances out to 130 nmi (241 km). 6.6.4.2.  TACAN  Channels.  Airborne  and  ground  TACAN  frequencies  are  paired  to form 126 "X" channels and 126 "Y" channels as shown in the NTIA Manual. In the "X"  configuration,  the  ground  reply  frequency  is  63  MHz  less  than  the  airborne frequency  for  channels  1-63  (low  band)  and  63  MHz  higher  for  channels  64-126 (high band). In the "Y" configuration, the ground reply frequency is 63 MHz higher than  the  airborne  frequency  for  channels  1-63  and  63  MHz  lower  than  the  airborne frequency  for  channels  64-126.  The  AF  primarily  uses  "X"  channels  within  the US&P,  except  for  certain  air-to-air  TACAN  operations.  TACAN  channels  1-16  and 60-69  are  reserved  for  military  tactical  and  training  operations,  while  the  remaining 100 "X" channels are used by the NAS. 6.6.4.3.  Air-to-Air TACAN Channels. The following applies to AF units that need to use TACAN channels for air-to-air operations: 6.6.4.3.1.  TACAN frequency assignments are normally for a 10-year period, with renewal, after coordination with the FAA. 6.6.4.3.2.  TACAN operations using the azimuth mode are authorized only within areas bounded by specific geographical coordinates. Send frequency proposals in SFAF to AFSMO through the appropriate MAJCOM. Include in SFAF Item 531 the geographical coordinates that enclose the desired area of operation. If several states are involved, insert "USA" in Items 300 and 400 and list all states in SFAF Item  530.  Coordinate  with  FAA  for  all  areas  involved.  Ask  for  "Y"  channels  if technically possible. State the number of channels needed and justify their use in SFAF Item 520. 6.6.5.  Distance Measuring Equipment (DME). DME operates on frequencies in the UHF spectrum between 962-1213 MHz in a LOS principle and furnishes distance information with  a  high  degree  of  accuracy.  In  the  operation  of  DME,  paired  pulses  at  a  specific spacing are sent out from the aircraft (this being the interrogation) and are received at the ground station. The ground station (transponder) then transmits paired pulses back to the aircraft at the same pulse spacing but on a different frequency. The time required for the AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 31 round trip of this signal exchange is measured in the airborne DME unit and is translated into distance (nmi) from the aircraft to the ground station. 6.6.5.1.  Air-to-air DME operations are authorized on an area-wide basis (e.g., state or states,  US,  or  US&P).  Submit  frequency  proposals  for  DME  operations  in  SFAF through  command  channels  to  AFSMO.  Give  the  number  of  channels  needed,  the maximum number of aircraft involved in the operation and justification for use of the civil  channels.    Apply  for  “Y”  channels  if  technically  possible.    Include  in  SFAF Item520 the statement, “Required for DME operations only; will not use the azimuth mode.” 6.6.6.  VOR.  VHF  Omnidirectional  Range  facilities  provide  bearing  information  to aircraft  and  operate  in  the  108-117.95  MHz  band  as  shown  in  the  NTIA  Manual.  Most VORs use voice and Morse code transmissions to identify the ground facility. 6.6.7.  VOR  Tactical  Air  Navigation  (VORTAC).  The  VORTAC  is  a  facility  consisting of a collocated VOR and TACAN. The VORTAC is the most common unified aid within the AF. Both facilities are located in the same place, transmit simultaneously on a paired channel  and  share  the  same  three-letter  identifier.  If  the  facilities  do  not  meet  the following antenna separation criteria, they are not considered a single NAVAID and must use  unpaired  channels  and  different  identifiers.  Only  the  FAA  may  waive  these requirements. 6.6.7.1.  For  stations  used  in  terminal  areas  for  approach  procedures,  the  separation for  a  standard  VOR  antenna  and  the  associated  DME  or  TACAN  antenna  will  not exceed  100  feet.  For  a  Doppler  VOR  antenna  and  associated  DME  or  TACAN antenna, separation will not exceed 260 feet. 6.6.7.2.  VOR and DME or TACAN antenna separation will not exceed 2,000 feet for facilities  providing  only  enroute  services.  Refer  to  the  NTIA  Manual  for  complete table. 6.6.8.  ATC  Radar  Beacon  System  (ATCRBS)  Identification  Friend  or  Foe  (IFF)  and Selective Identification Feature (SIF). The IFF/SIF consists of a ground interrogator that operates on 1030 MHz and an airborne transponder that  replies to  the interrogations on 1090  MHz.  Frequency  assignments  are  required  for  both  the  ground  interrogator  and airborne  reply.  Frequency  1090  MHz  is  also  used  to  transmit  Automatic  Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast  (ADS-B)  data  asynchronously  as  an  extended  squitter  1090-ES.  These  emissions  also  require  a  frequency  assignment.  The  IFF/SIF  is  normally  paired with  the  airport  surveillance  radar  (ASR).  If  the  IFF/SIF  is  paired  with  an  ASR,  SFAF Item 503 must cross reference the ASR. For example:  P/W AN/TPX-42, PRR250. 6.6.8.1.  The surveillance radars is normally 300 watts. transmitter  power  of  beacon interrogators  used  with terminal 6.6.8.2.  IFF/SIF  ramp  tester  units  will  use  a  PRR  of  230  pulses  per  second  (PPS), triggered for stability and limited to 4 watts of transmitter power to the antenna. 6.6.8.3.  PRRs  for  IFF/SIF  may  be  the  same  as,  or  submultiples  of  the  ASR  PRR. Also, if the ASR operates with a staggered PRR, the IFF/SIF may also operate with a staggered PRR, normally below 400 PRR. 32 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 6.7.  Radar.  Radar systems operate in various portions of the spectrum. 6.7.1.  Aeronautical  Radio  Navigation  Radar.  Only  ground-based  radars  performing  an ATC  function  may  use  these  frequency  bands.  Use  includes  associated  airborne transponders  activated  by  radars  operating  in  the  same  band.  Coordinate  with  FAA  via WebFCR  before  sending  frequency  proposals.  Radar  equipment  performing  a  function other than listed below will not normally have frequency assignments in these bands. 6.7.2.  Long-Range Radar (LRR).  The 1240-1370 MHz band is used for LRR. 6.7.2.1.  Air  Surveillance  Radar  (ASR).  ASRs  operate  in  the  2700-2900  MHz  band. The FAA controls the frequencies and PRR. In certain areas of the US it is difficult to accommodate  new  radars  in  the  2700-2900  MHz  band.  Radar  systems  complying with Criteria D of the Radar Spectrum Engineering Criteria (RSEC), under the NTIA Manual,  shall  incorporate  additional  EMC  features  when  intended  for  use  in designated heavily used areas, or for collocated operations with other radars. The HQ FAA  and  the  agency  asking  for  the  assignment  assess  the  need  for  these  additional EMC  features  when  coordinating  a  frequency  assignment  in  the  2700-2900  MHz band.  Frequency  assignments  for  those  radars  with  the  additional  EMC  features installed will contain record note S373. 6.7.2.2.  Precision  Approach  Radar  (PAR).  PARs  operate  in  the  9000-9200  MHz band. 6.7.3.  Aircraft Control and Warning (AC&W). The military AC&W radars operate in the 2900-3100 MHz band. The FAA does not control this frequency band; however, since the AC&W radar is normally paired with an IFF/SIF, the FAA will need to know the PRR of the AC&W radar so they can properly coordinate on the PRR for the IFF/SIF. 6.8.  Radar  Speed  Guns.  Police  radar  speed  guns,  are  not  exempt  from  requiring  spectrum equipment allocation and frequency assignment. 6.9.  Commercial  Satellite  Use.  See  para  6.43.,  Commercial  Satellite  Communications,  for additional information and guidance on DoD use of commercial satellites. 6.10.  Spacecraft  and  Balloon  Systems.  Spacecraft  and  balloon  systems  developed  or operated by the AF must be capable of on and off control of emissions by telecommand. 6.11.  Electronic  Fuses.  Installation  commanders  set  local  coordination  procedures  for installation and tenant activities that develop, design, or use electronic fuses. Electronic fuses that  activate  detonation  devices  do  not  require  NTIA  spectrum  certification.  Units  that develop, design, or use electronic fuses must: 6.11.1.  Research,  determine,  and  evaluate  existing compatibility with the intended RF environment. frequency  assignments for 6.11.2.  Contact  the  applicable  spectrum  managers  (MAJCOM  or  DoD  AFC)  to  select fuse frequencies. 6.11.3.  Limit fuse-triggering transmitter emissions to the narrowest bandwidth possible. 6.11.4.  Reduce the level of unnecessary emissions. 6.11.5.  Use equipment tunable on more than one frequency. AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 33 6.11.6.  Provide  protection  from  accidental  triggering  by  other  RF  emissions  through coding, improving receiver selectivity, shielding components, or other techniques. 6.12.  Weather  Radars.  Weather  radars  normally  operate  in  the  2700-2900  and  5350-5650 MHz bands.  Spot frequency assignments are required. 6.13.  Weather  radars  that  use  conventional  magnetron  output  tubes  have  inherent  spurious emission  levels  that  may  cause  RF  interference  to  digital  radio-relay  microwave  ystems.  Existing radars in the category include the WSR-57, WSR-74S, WSR-74C, AN/FPQ-21, and the  AN/FPS-77.  Users  must  install  RF  waveguide  filters  that  reduce  the  spurious  emission levels by at least 40 dB before using these radars at a new location. 6.14.  Telemetry Frequencies. The following bands are allocated for telemetry operations of aeronautical  vehicles,  upper  atmosphere  research  devices,  guided  missiles,  space  system boosters, and space vehicles subject to compliance with NTIA Manual 4.3.4, Telemetry Plan. 6.14.1.  The  1435-1535  MHz  and  2360-2395  MHz  bands.  These  frequencies  are designated for telemetry and associated telecommand during flight testing of manned and unmanned  aircraft,  missiles,  or  their  major  components.  Coordinate  all  operations  in these  bands  with  the  AFTRCC  and  the  applicable  AFC.  The  NTIA  Manual  provides detailed  AFTRCC  procedures.  Refer  to  Section  8.3.17,  NTIA  Manual  for  the  AFTRCC coordination agencies. 6.14.1.1.  Assignments in both bands are centered on frequencies at standard intervals of  1  MHz,  beginning  at  1435.5  and  2310.5  MHz  respectively,  and  are  allowed bandwidths of 1, 3, or 5 MHz. Assignments with bandwidths greater than 1 MHz are centered  so  they  do  not  extend  outside  the  allocated  bands.  Emissions  with bandwidths greater than 5 MHz may be approved by NTIA on a case-by-case basis. 6.14.1.2.  The  1435-1525  MHz  band  consists  of  ninety-nine  (99)  1-MHz  channels designated for telemetry. 6.14.1.2.1.  Frequencies 1444.5, 1453.5, 1501.5, 1515.5, 1524.5, and 1525.5 MHz are shared with flight telemetry mobile stations. Use limited to 1 MHz bandwidth except  for frequencies 1524.5 and 1525.5 MHz  where a bandwidth  of 2  MHz is permitted. 6.14.1.3.  The  2310-2390  MHz  band  consists  of  seventy-three  (73)  1-MHz  channels designated for telemetry. 6.14.1.3.1.  Frequencies  2312.5,  2332.5,  2352.5,  2364.5,  2370.5,  and  2382.5  are shared  on  a  coequal  basis  with  operations  of  expendable  and  reusable  launch vehicles.  Such use is limited to 1 MHz bandwidth. 6.14.1.4.  Telemetry  associated  with the  earth's atmosphere,  as  well  as  incidental  orbiting  before  reentry  of  occupied  objects undergoing flight tests, is also allowed within these bands. launching  and  reentry into 6.14.1.5.  Telecommand  stations  authorized  to  operate  in  these  bands  must  directly support telemetry functions. Assignments are limited to 1 MHz bandwidth and must use antennas having a half-power beamwidth of no more than 8 degrees and a front- to-back ratio of at least 20 dB. 34 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 6.14.1.6.  Channels designated for aeronautical telemetry in the 1435-1525 MHz band are also available for space telemetry on a shared basis. 6.14.1.7.  The 1530-1535 MHz band is allocated primarily to Maritime Mobile (MM) satellite services (MSS); mobile aeronautical telemetry is secondary. 6.14.2.  The  2025-2100  MHz  and  2200-2290  MHz  bands.  These  frequencies  are designated  for  telemetry  and  associated  telecommand  for  launch  vehicles,  missiles,  and upper atmosphere research rockets, in addition to space missions (of extended duration). Such use is on a coequal shared basis with fixed and mobile LOS operations. All (space-related)  operations  in  these  bands  must  be  coordinated  with  DoD  and  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 6.14.2.1.  The  2200-2290  MHz  band  consists  of  ninety  (90)  1-MHz  narrowband channels beginning at 2200.5 MHz in 1-MHz increments through 2289.5 MHz. 6.14.2.2.  Emission  bandwidths  greater  than  1  MHz  are  permitted,  provided  the assigned  frequencies  are  centered  on  the  center  frequencies  of  narrowband  channels and do not extend outside the allocated band. 6.14.2.3.  No  provision  is  made  in  the  2200-2290  MHz  band  for  flight  testing  of piloted aircraft. 6.15.  International  Distress  and  Emergency  Frequencies.  The  U.S.  Government  and  DoD have  adopted  the  international  distress  and  emergency  frequencies  shown  in  Table  3 Frequency assignments are not required. Table 3.  Emergency Frequencies. SERVICE International Distress and Emergency             FREQUENCY (EMISSION) 500 kHz COMMUNICATION SERVICE Aeronautical, Maritime, Survival Craft FUNCTION Distress (Telegraphy) 2182 kHz 3023 kHz 5680 kHz 8364 kHz 40.5 MHz 121.5 MHz 123.1 MHz 156.3 156.8 MHz 243.0 MHz 406-406.1 MHz 53.3 MHz (36K00F3E) Aeronautical, MM, Survival Craft Mobile Mobile Aeronautical, MM Mobile Aeronautical Aeronautical, Mobile Aeronautical, MM MM Military Aeronautical Mobile-Satellite  Distress Search and Rescue (SAR) SAR Operations SAR Military Joint Common (US&P only) Emergency and Safety SAR, Scene of Action SAR Operations Call, Reply and Safety Emergency and Survival Emergency Position- Indicating Radiobeacon   AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 35 6.15.1.  Any mobile station experiencing an emergency may use the frequencies listed in Table  6.2.  If  a  mobile  station  in  distress  is  unable  to  make  contact  on  emergency frequencies,  it  may  use  any  available  means  to  obtain  help.  Policies  for  using  these frequencies are: 6.15.1.1.  Send  distress  calls  or  messages  only  on  the  authority  of  the  person responsible for the ship, aircraft, or other vehicle carrying the mobile station. 6.15.1.2.  The  frequencies  are  used  only  for  actual  emergencies,  not  for  simulated emergency training. 6.15.1.3.  Do not  radiate when testing an emergency frequency during experimental, production, or maintenance operations. 6.15.1.4.  Do  not  make  operational  checks  to  ensure  proper  system  operation (confidence checks) more than once in any 24 hour period and keep them as short as possible. 6.15.1.5.  Activities  completing  a  communications  contact  on  equipment  used  for emergency purposes will consider the contact the confidence check for that period. 6.15.1.6.  Only  make  confidence  checks  with  stations  authorized  to  operate  on  the particular emergency frequency. Do not transmit "in the blind" for confidence checks. 6.16.  Radio  Amateur  Civil  Emergency  Services  (RACES).  AF  activities  may  make  initial contact  on  the  frequencies  listed  in  Table  6.2  with  RACES  stations  to  coordinate  on emergency  or  disaster  related  matters  IAW  the  FCC  rules  covered  in  47  C.F.R.  §  97.407. Additional information can be found in the NTIA Manual. 6.17.  Standard  Frequency  and  Time  Broadcasts.  Frequencies  are  nationally  and internationally  allocated  and  assigned  for  specific  stations  to  broadcast  time  and  frequency signals.  The following are key points about the national standard broadcasts: 6.17.1.  US Standard Broadcasts. The National Institute of Standards and Technology of the  Department  of  Commerce  operates  three  radio  stations  providing  highly  accurate frequency and time signals: 6.17.1.1.  WWV  near  Fort  Collins  CO  broadcasts  on  frequencies  2.5,  5,  10,  15,  and 20 MHz. 6.17.1.2.  WWVB, also near Fort Collins CO broadcasts on frequency 60 kHz. 6.17.1.3.  WWVH,  on  the  island  on  Kauai  HI  broadcasts  on  frequencies  2.5,  5,  10, and 15 MHz. 6.17.1.4.  These  stations  provide  government  and  private  agencies  precise  time  and accurate  frequency  signals  for  setting  chronometers  and  calibrating  frequency- sensitive equipment. 6.18.  DoD  Use  of  Frequencies  in  Non-Federal  Government  Bands.  The  military  may  use some frequencies allocated for non-federal government use on a secondary, NIB as outlined below. These frequencies may be used to meet peacetime tactical and training requirements as  well  as  military  test  range  operations.  The  frequencies  are  used  only  when  government bands  will  not  satisfy  frequency  needs  and  when  use  does  not  cause  interference  to  non-36 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 federal  government  users.  The  military  must  accept  any  interference  caused  by  non-federal government  authorized  users.  Military  use  of  a  frequency  will  not  bar  new  non-federal government assignments on that or adjacent frequencies. 6.18.1.  The 4-27 MHz Maritime Mobile (MM) and Broadcasts Bands. AF activities may use  frequencies  allocated  to  the  MM  service  and  broadcast  services  for  peacetime military  tactical  and  training  purposes  within  the  US&P.  Refer  to  the  NTIA  Manual Section 7.15.2. 6.18.1.1.  MAJCOM  SMOs  are  delegated  assignment  authority  in  these  bands  to exclude  use  of  long  haul  communications.  No  assignment  in  either  the  GMF  or  the FRRS is required. 6.18.1.2.  MAJCOMs  will  implement  procedures  to  track  assignments  within  their respective  command  to  include  unit,  location,  and  inclusive  dates  (not  to  exceed  1 year). Either spot frequency or band assignments are authorized. 6.18.1.3.  MAJCOMs  may  not  use  this  authority  to  circumvent  standard  frequency assignment procedures for fixed terrestrial systems or HF networks. 6.18.1.4.  This  authority  is  to  support  training  and  field  operations  around  an installation  or  exercise  area  where  the  type  of  equipment  used  is  either  portable  or transportable.  Aeronautical mobile operations are strictly prohibited. 6.18.1.5.  Users  will  limit  transmitter  power  to  the  minimum  necessary  for  reliable communications and will not exceed the power for specific types of emissions. Refer to  the  NTIA  Manual  Section  7.15.2  paras  1,  a  and  b  for  the  allowable  frequencies, emissions, and power levels in the 4-27 MHz band. 6.18.1.6.  When  notified  by  the  FCC  or  other  authority  that  AF  transmissions  are interfering  with  a  MM  or  broadcast  station,  the  identified  station  will  immediately cease operation. 6.18.1.7.  Users  may  receive  interference  on  these  bands  and  will  not  try  to  obtain relief  from  such  interference;  however,  they  can  request  a  replacement  frequency through command spectrum management channels. 6.18.1.8.  AFSMO  reserves  assignment  authority  for  those  frequencies  listed  in Section 7.15.2, para 2 of the NTIA Manual for long haul HF operations. Request use of these frequencies through command channels. 6.18.2.  Military use of non-federal government bands above 25 MHz. 6.18.2.1.  The AF may use frequencies in the non-federal government bands above 25 MHz for tactical and training operations in the US&P as shown in the NTIA Manual Section 7.15.3. AF activities will coordinate use with their host MAJCOM SMO and the local FCC through the FCC Watch Officer. 6.18.2.2.  Military use of these frequencies will not bar present or future assignments of non-federal government frequencies to non-military government agencies through normal IRAC and FCC coordination. 6.18.2.3.  The  military  will  protect  specific  non-federal  government  frequencies authorized for government agencies. AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 37 6.18.3.  Military  Test  Range  Operations.  The  FCC  and  the  military  services  have arranged for the military use of non-federal government bands at the military test ranges shown in the NTIA Manual Section 7.17.  The authorized frequency bands are listed in the  NTIA  Manual.  The  following  procedures  apply  to  use  of  these  non-federal government bands: 6.18.3.1.  Do  not  use  these  frequencies  if  government  bands  can  satisfy  the requirement. 6.18.3.2.  Limit use to those intermittent operations that can be stopped immediately upon notification that they are causing harmful interference. 6.18.3.3.  Select  frequencies  to  avoid  harmful  interference  to  known  non-federal government operations. 6.18.3.4.  Where  practical,  the  military  station  identifies  itself  using  a  call  sign  or periodic interruption according to a prearranged schedule. 6.18.3.5.  Do not use non-federal government bands to develop military systems that may need a new frequency allocation. 6.19.  Amateur  Frequencies.  The  military  services  may  not  use  amateur  frequencies  within the US&P during normal peacetime conditions, except as authorized by the NTIA or FCC. 6.20.  Citizen Band (CB) Radio Service. AF CB stations must operate IAW 47 CFR Part 95, Personal  Radio  Services.  AFSMO  maintains  frequency  assignments  within  this  band authorized  by  the  FCC  for  AF  CB  operations.  Frequency  proposals  for  CB  frequency assignments  are  considered  on  a  case-by-case  basis  based  on  justification  and  operational concept. Assignments will include record note S348 in SFAF Item 500 and results of national level coordination with the FCC. 6.20.1.  Law  enforcement  agencies  may  communicate  with  the  motoring  public  on  and around  an  installation  for  the  purpose  of  providing  emergency  assistance  to  the  public. Use CB Channel 9 for this purpose. 6.20.2.  Emergency  vehicles  using  public  highways  for  travel  or  guarding  military convoys may communicate with the motoring public and civil authorities. 6.20.3.  Convoys  traveling  on  public  highways  may  communicate  with  the  motoring public and civil authorities. 6.20.4.  Only US government personnel may operate the equipment. 6.20.5.  Do not use CB radios to conduct military-related communications, or instead of obtaining a frequency assignment to operate on an appropriate military system. 6.20.6.  Users will not submit frequency requests for CB assignments. Authorization for the use of CB will only be granted IAW the above rules. 6.21.  Broadcasting Service Frequencies. The military services are not authorized to operate any  broadcast  facility  within  the  US&P,  except  in  select  circumstances.  Exceptions  are Travelers  Information  System  Amplitude  Modulation  (AM)  broadcast  stations  that  are licensed through the FCC. These stations are non-commercial and are generally restricted to bulletin board-type information such as available installation facilities, travel restrictions, and 38 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 driving hazards. Submit  requirements  for broadcast  facilities through  command channels  to AFSMO for FCC coordination. 6.22.  Cellular  Telephone  Systems.  These  systems  operate  on  non-federal  government frequencies.  National  regulations  do  not  permit  assignment  of  these  frequencies  to government  agencies  (including  DoD).  AF  activities  planning  to  procure  transportable Advanced Wireless Service (AWS), Cellular, and Personal Communications Services (PCS) Systems, including Cell-On-Wheels (COW) and Cell-On-Light Truck (Colt) systems, which operate  in  the  bands  698-758,  775-788,  805-806,  824-849  MHz,  901-902  MHz,  930-931 MHz, 940-941 MHz, 1710-1755 MHz, 1850-1990 MHz, and 2110-2155 MHz are required to obtain NTIA spectrum certification. 6.22.1.  Consumer  Signal  Booster  (Cell  Repeater).    Consumer  signal  boosters  are permitted  on  AF  installations.  However,  ISM  approval  must  be  granted  prior  to  any contractual  agreements  with  service  providers.    In  addition,  a  JSC  study  must  be performed to  ensure there will be no RF interference to  federal systems.    If no harmful interference is predicted in the JSC study, use of a consumer signal booster is permitted at the discretion of the ISM providing the power levels are maintained at/below FCC class B Part 15 requirements and are acquired from wireless providers.  The repeater may not be  modified  from  manufacturer’s  specifications.    Use/location  of  repeaters  must  be approved by appropriate cybersecurity personnel.  Repeaters do not require certification and are provided no protection from interference other than what may be experienced in the  non-federal  bands.    These  devices  can  only  be  used  if  and  only  if  the  following conditions  are met:   1. Subscriber  obtains some  form of licensee consent  to  operate the booster.  2. The booster is registered with their provider.  3.  Booster meets the Network Protection  Standard.  4.  Booster  is  FCC  certified.  5.  The  booster  is  operated  on  a secondary,  non-interference  basis  and  must  be  shut  down  if  it  causes  harmful interference. 6.23.  Pager Systems. The 138-144 MHz band is used for AF pager systems, unless another band  is  required  for  operational  reasons.  AF  activities  will  study  shared  use  of  existing paging systems in the area before asking for a frequency assignment and obligating funds for equipment.  Ensure  a  pager  frequency  authorization  is  available  before  deploying  pager equipment overseas. 6.24.  Maritime Mobile (MM) Frequencies. The 156-162 MHz band is allocated primarily for non-federal government MM communications. 6.24.1.  The channels in the MM band are reserved for communications between vessels and  designated  commercial  marine  operators  and  for  non-federal  government  ship-to- shore and inter-ship operations. 6.24.2.  Government stations may request the use of specific channels on a case-by-case basis if they have a valid need to communicate with the affected non-federal government licensees. AF activities will submit requirements through command channels to AFSMO. 6.24.2.1.  When  using  MM  frequencies,  regulations  in  the  NTIA  Manual  must  be adhered to. Channel 6, 156.3 MHz, may be authorized for inter-ship communications.  This  channel  is  authorized for coordinated operation at  the scene of a SAR incident (refer to the NTIA Manual). Coast stations may use this channel during emergencies AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 39 affecting  life  or  property  when  other  means  of  communications  are  not  practical. Channel  22,  157.1  MHz,  is  the  primary  frequency  for  liaison  communications between  ship  stations  and  the  US  Coast  Guard  stations.  AF  activities  will  submit requirements  through  command  channels  to  AFSMO.  Channels  81A  and  82A  are allocated for “US Government Only” and can be requested to support AF operations. 6.25.  Experimental Radio Stations. Certain experimental radio stations are authorized by the NTIA Manual to use any RF except those bands specifically excluded by the NTIA Manual for short or intermittent periods without prior authorization of specific frequencies, subject to conditions outlined in Section 7.11 of the NTIA Manual. 6.26.  Industrial, Scientific, and Medical Equipment. Industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment  is  defined  as  the  operation  of  equipment  or  appliances  designed  to  generate  and use  RF  energy  for  ISM,  domestic  or  similar  purposes,  excluding  application  in  the  field  of telecommunications.  Assignments  are  not  required  to  operate  ISM  equipment  within  the US&P, IAW the conditions outlined in Section 7.10 of the NTIA Manual. 6.27.  Family  Radio  Service  (FRS).  FRS  is  a  FCC  unlicensed  low  powered  service  that provides coverage up to 2 miles using frequencies within the FRS frequency pool (see Table 6.3.). FRS radio may be used on any of the 14 FRS channels, which are shared between all FRS users. Thirty eight privacy codes allow the FRS users to limit the transmissions received to  those  users  on  the  same  channel  and  privacy  code.  This  reduces  confusion  between multiple conversations on the same channel. A reminder that any FRS user can listen to any ongoing  conversation  and  can  legally  break  into  that  conversation.  No  FCC  license  or permanent  frequency  assignment  is  required  and  no  FRS  channel  may  be  assigned  to  any specific individual or organization. Table 4.  FRS Frequency Pool. FRS Frequency Pool (MHz) 462.5625 462.6625 467.5875 467.6875 462.5875 462.6875 467.6125 467.7125 462.6125 462.7125 467.6375  462.6375 467.5625 467.6625   6.27.1.  Federal  government  entities  are  authorized  to  purchase  and  operate  radios certified  by  the  FCC  in  the  FRS  pursuant  to  47  CFR  Part  95,  Subpart  B.  Federal  users will  be  accorded  the  same  privileges  as  non-federal  users.  FRS  users  must  share  each channel and no user is assured protection from interference caused by another authorized user.  AF  FRS  users  may  not  purchase  and  operate  FRS  radios  for  planned communications  operations  that  safeguard  human  life  or  property.  AF  FRS  users  must comply with the following conditions: 6.27.1.1.  The provisions of 47 CFR Part 95 and Section 7.5.8 of the NTIA Manual. 6.27.1.2.  Use  of  FRS  devices  outside  the  US&P  is  subject  to  host  country  and international  regulations.  AF  members  or  employees  are  not  authorized  to  use  FRS radios  outside  the  US&P  without  HN  approval.  Unified  command  directives  apply. Coordinate FRS use with the appropriate AF component SMO. 40 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 6.27.1.3.  AF  members  and  employee  users  are  responsible  for  all  communications using FRS radio equipment.  Use must comply with federal, state, and local law. 6.27.1.4.  The installation commander may prohibit FRS when interference to mission essential EM equipment is anticipated or to resolve a suspected RFI problem. 6.27.1.5.  AF members and employees using FRS radios must relinquish channel use for  emergency  communication  messages  concerning  the  immediate  safety  of  life  or the immediate protection of property. 6.27.1.6.  Use  only  FCC  certified  FRS.  Any  modification  to  the  equipment  to  boost power, add a different antenna, or to increase the gain of the current antenna, cancels the  FCC  certification  and  voids  authority.  Illegal  FRS  equipment  is  subject  to confiscation. 6.27.1.7.  FRS  devices  are  not  authorized  for  classified,  sensitive  but  unclassified, command  and  control,  squadron  operational,  aircraft/flight  line  maintenance,  fire crash,  explosive  ordinance  disposal,  security  forces,  emergency/disaster  response, tactical or training operations, and/or medical communications. 6.27.1.8.  Under  no  circumstance  will  FRS  radios  be  permitted  for  use  in  controlled areas  without  express  written  consent  of  the  installation  commander  and  full compliance with all security directives. 6.27.1.9.  Use of FRS cannot be protected from harmful interference. FRS radios may not  cause  interference  to  any  licensed  device  and  must  accept  all  interference  from licensed devices. 6.27.1.10.  The FCC may restrict use of the FRS radios if the station is located within the  National  Radio  Quiet  Zone  (areas  of  MD,  VA,  and  WV  bounded  by  39°15’N 78°30’W, 39°15’N 80°30’W, 37°30’N 78°30’W, 37°30’N 80°30’W). 6.27.1.11.  AF  members  and  employees  assigned  to  non-appropriated  fund  activities and  some  appropriated  fund  activities  may  use  FRS  radios,  as  follows:  to communicate  with  non-government  users  during  AF  supported  or  sponsored community activities, i.e., scouts, Special Olympics, youth activities/sporting events, civil  disasters,  funeral  details  for  deceased  military  veterans,  etc.  In  addition,  FRS radios may be used for administrative purposes when communicating in warehouses, commissaries, base exchanges, billeting areas, work crews, etc. FRS radios may also be  used  on  AF  installations  where  the  public  is  permitted  entrance  and  in  family housing areas. 6.28.  Inter-Squad  Radio  (ISR).  The  ISR  is  the  military  FRS  radio  operating  in  the  380- 399.975 MHz sub-band and is recommended over the commercial FRS for AF members and employees. Because it is in the government frequency band and the potential for EMI is less, it  can  be  used  for  tactical  or  training  operations  unlike  the  FRS  that  uses  civil  spectrum. Other  operations  permitted  with  the  ISR  are  cantonment  areas  and  roving/walking  guard posts. Unless  appropriately encrypted,  ISRs cannot  be used to  transmit  classified, sensitive, command  and  control, response/medical to  AFMAN  17-1302,  Communications  Security  (COMSEC) communications.  Refer Operations, for guidance on protecting these types of communication. security,  and/or  emergency fire/crash, AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 41 6.28.1.  Do not modify the ISR. 6.28.2.  Only  AF  members,  employees,  and  contractors  providing  support  to  military operations will use the ISR. 6.28.3.  ISR will not be used for personal business. 6.28.4.  Possession  and  use  of  ISR  devices  outside  the  US&P  is  subject  to  host  country and international regulations. AF members, employees, or contractors are not authorized to  use  ISR  devices  outside  the  US&P  without  HN  approval.  CCMD  directives  apply. Coordinate  ISR  use  with  the  appropriate  AF  component  SMO.  Additional  restrictions may  be  imposed  in  different  AORs  (i.e.,  Tactical  and  Training  LMRs  require  National Security Agency type 1 encryption). 6.29.  General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS). The GMRS is an FCC licensed personal two- way voice communications service used to facilitate the activities of an individual and their immediate family providing coverage up to  5 miles. GMRS cannot  be used by  government agencies under any circumstances. 6.30.  Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS). The FCC established MURS in 2002 as a Citizens Band Radio Service. This equipment cannot be used by government employees in the line of duty, or as an employee of any government entity, including non-appropriated fund activities. 6.31.  Terrestrial  and  Space  Systems  within  Shared  Bands.  The  following    information applies  to  those  bands  between  1  GHz  and  50  GHz  equally  shared  by  space  and  terrestrial services: 6.31.1.  AFSMO  determines  whether  a  proposed  fixed  or  mobile  station  in  these  bands will  be  within  the  normal  coordination  distance  of  an  earth  station  listed  in  the  NTIA Manual. 6.31.2.  If  the  location  is  within  the  coordination  distance,  AFSMO  coordinates  the request with the agency operating the earth station. 6.31.3.  Begin  coordinating  earth  stations  during  the  system  review  using  procedures outlined  in  the  NTIA  Manual.  Indicate  on  applications  for  frequency  assignments  the status of coordination with agencies that have terrestrial operations in the same band and within the coordination area of the earth stations. 6.31.4.  AFSMO does not take final assignment action until national level coordination is complete. 6.32.  Space and Balloon Systems. Include with each frequency request to radiate EM energy from  spacecraft  or  balloon  systems,  either  a  detailed  description  of  the  methods  for  on-off telecommand capability, or a justified request for an exception. 6.33.  Space-Ground  Link  Subsystem  (SGLS)  and  Unified  S-Band  (USB).  Satellite operations  for  military  satellites  are  authorized  for  SGLS  uplinks  in  the  band  1761-1842 MHz  and  USB  uplinks  in  the  band  2025-2110  MHz  and  SGLS  and  USB  downlinks  in  the band  2200-2290  MHz.  Spectrum  managers  at  Space  and  Missile  Systems  Center  (SMC) located  at  Los  Angeles  AFB  CA;  Eastern  Range  (ER)  located  at  Patrick  AFB  FL;  and Western Range (WR) located at Vandenberg AFB CA manage and issue discrete frequency assignments on a program-by-program basis for all operations in these bands and coordinate 42 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 with  Federal  Satellite  Operations  (per  DoD/NASA  MOU,  23  October  2003)  and  also  the Electronic News Gatherers for uplink operation in the 2025-2110 MHz band. NOTE: Dual- Band  satellite  operations  policy  requires  shared  AF,  NASA,  and  National  Oceanic  & Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  operation  in  the  2025-2110  and  2200-2290  MHz bands. 6.34.  Antenna Test on Frequencies Above 30 MHz. Applications for antenna testing should be IAW Section 8.2.23 of the NTIA Manual and include the following information in SFAF Item 520: 6.34.1.  Effective radiated power.  If unknown, give a reasonable estimate. 6.34.2.  Profile of the surrounding terrain by description or other means. If testing within shielded enclosures, so state and give the attenuation (in dB) provided by the enclosure. 6.34.3.  Antenna configuration, to include: 6.34.3.1.  Whether full scale or less than full scale. 6.34.3.2.  The estimated hours of use in local time (e.g., 0800 to 1700 daily, Monday through Friday; daytime only, Monday through Friday). 6.35.  Requests for Restricted Frequencies. Except  in  unusual  circumstances, do not  ask for bands  where  regulations  prohibit  assignments  (e.g.,  radio  astronomy  bands,  standard frequency bands, some space bands, etc.). If a frequency is needed in a prohibited band, fully explain in SFAF Item 520 why operation is necessary in the prohibited band. Include type of service  for  which  the  antenna  test  is  intended,  (e.g.,  radiolocation,  radionavigation,  fixed, space).  Give  the  government  agency  and  contract  number  if  testing  supports  a  government contract.  Explain the mission impact if you are not provided an assignment. 6.36.  Line-Of-Sight  Frequency  Diversity  (Use  of  multiple  paired  transmit  and  receive antennas  operating  at  different  frequencies).  Justify  the  use  of  frequency  diversity  for  new LOS transmission systems in 1780-1850, 2200-2290, 4400-4990, 7125-7250, 7300-7975, and 8025-8400  MHz  bands.  Explain  the  need  for  such  a  high  degree  of  systems  reliability  and cite  the  engineering  study  showing  that  frequency  diversity  is  necessitated  by  the  required reliability.  Existing  systems  using  frequency  diversity  may  continue  until  frequency congestion requires reevaluation. 6.37.  Operating FCC-Licensed Stations on AF Installations. 6.37.1.  CBs,  amateurs,  taxi  companies,  commercial  entities,  and  other  FCC  licensed radio stations may transmit on AF installations but are subject to limitations imposed by the installation commander. Limitations should not unnecessarily infringe on the rights of the individual to operate a radio according to FCC Rules and Regulations (47  CFR Part 73, Radio Broadcast Services). 6.37.2.  Based  on  need,  commanders  may  require  registration  of  FCC-licensed  station operating  on  an  AF  installation.  Registration  instructions  should  be  included  within installation introduction materials. 6.37.3.  If FCC licensed stations are involved in interference: 6.37.3.1.  Report interference from a FCC licensed station to AF operations according to  AFI  17-221.  The  installation  commander  may  direct  an  on-installation  offending AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 43 station  to  cease  operations  and  will  notify  AFSMO,  through  host  MAJCOM,  of details of the action within 3 duty days. AFSMO will give this information, including action  taken,  to  HQ  FCC,  Washington  DC  if  appropriate,  through  the  FCC  Watch Officer. 6.37.3.2.  Licensees  report  interference  between  two  FCC  licensed  stations  to  the FCC Watch Officer. 6.37.3.3.  Report  AF  operations  interference  to  FCC  licensed  stations  according  to AFI 17-221. 6.37.3.4.  The FCC resolves interference by a FCC licensed station to the reception of commercial  broadcast  stations  or  the  use  of  home  entertainment  units.  Victims  of such interference report the problem to the FCC Watch Officer. is   Link-16 6.38.  Link-16,  formerly  known  as  Joint  Tactical  Information  Distribution  System (JTIDS)/Multifunctional  Information  Distribution  System  (MIDS). the nomenclature  for  terminals  used  in  a  Link-16  terminal  network.  Link-16  utilizes  Time Division  Multiple  Access  (TDMA)  to  provide  integrated  communications,  navigation,  and platform  identification.  Link-16  enables  secure,  jam-resistant,  tactical,  radio  navigation  and communications with low probability of intercept and jamming between ground-based (fixed and mobile), ship, and airborne platforms. When not transmitting, each terminal can receive information broadcasted by other terminals in the area. Link-16 terminals use message time-of-arrival  (TOA)  information,  broadcast  position  data,  and  multilateration  techniques  to determine their own location. Link-16 terminals operate from 969 MHz to 1208 MHz using 51 hopped carrier frequencies with a maximum power of 200 watts. The carriers exclude the IFF  communication  bands  centered  at  1030  MHz  (transponder  receiver)  and  at  1090  MHz (interrogator receiver).  Additionally, by January 2025, all fielded Link-16 terminals will be capable of remapping up to 14 frequencies, refer to NTIA Manual para 4.3.17. 6.38.1.  Users  will  process  Link-16  frequency  requirements  through  command  channels to  AFSMO.  All  Link-16  frequency  actions,  including  waivers  for  time  slot  duty  factors (TSDF), will be coordinated at the national level with the FAA through NMSC. A Link-16  worksheet  is  required  for  temporary  and  new  permanent  requirements,  frequency proposals will be coordinated via SXXI. Permanent frequency requests follow the normal IRAC/FAS  process  and  require  a minimum  of sixty (60) business  days lead time. Once FAA approved, temporary authorizations will be entered into the FRRS only. 6.38.2.  Link-16  Terminals.  Link-16  terminals  operate  within  the  frequency  band allocated worldwide for aeronautical radionavigation. The FAA controls use of this band in the US&P. The DoD must operate within the strict guidelines set by the FAA to ensure flight safety. 6.38.3.  Frequency assignments and operations must be in strict adherence to Chairman of the CJCSI 6232.01 (Series), LINK-16 Spectrum Deconfliction, and ACP 190 US SUPP-1 (D), Annex F, LINK-16 Coordination Procedures. 6.39.  Station  Keeping  Equipment  (SKE)  (AN/APN-169  &  AN/APN-243).  SKE  provides transport  aircraft  (C-130)  the  ability  to  fly  safely  in  close  formation  in  all  weather.  This  is accomplished  by  presenting  the  aircrew  with  a  situational  display  that  shows  the  relative position of the other formation members in reference to the lead aircraft and alerts the crew 44 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 via  audiovisual  proximity  warning  when  aircraft  come  too  close  to  each  other.  The  system transmits high-powered pulses on one of four frequencies (3350, 3390, 3470, 3510 MHz). 6.39.1.  The AMC Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) SMO maintains four frequency assignments for SKE usage within the US&P. The TACC SMO deconflicts SKE usage to ensure safe passage of multiple formations and drop zones. 6.39.2.  Station  Keeping  Equipment  Follow-On  (SKEFO)  (AN/APN-243A)  provides transport  aircraft  the  ability  to  fly  safely  in  close  formation  in  all  weather.  The  system  allows interoperation of up to 100 aircraft in 100nmi  range, utilizing a low probability of detection spread spectrum waveform in the 3100-3600 MHz band. The frequency hop set is programmable based on HN authorizations. Multiple hop sets may be loaded in to the system  depending  on  each  nation’s  authorizations.  The  lead  aircraft  coordinates  the manual  switching  of  the  hop  sets  at  country  borders.  When  used  with  the  zone  maker (AN/TPN-027B),  the  SKEFO  system  operates  in  high-powered  pulsed  mode  on  one  of four fixed channels and the system provides for precision guidance to the drop zone. 6.40.  Single  Channel  Ground  and  Airborne  Radio  System  (SINCGARS).  The  AF  acquires ground  SINCGARS  radios  from  the  Army.  This  program  encompasses  the  following program  elements: Airborne SINCGARS Jam  Resistant VHF radio  (AN/ARC-222) and the Ground  SINCGARS  Jam  Resistant  VHF  Communications.  The  increased  usage  of  tactical Unmanned  Aerial  Systems  (UAS)  and  other  Airborne  Communications  Node  platforms requires  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  request  procedures  as  well  as  potential  limiting factors when considering employing the SINCGARS radio in ground based and/or airborne-based  operations,  hopping  or  non-hopping  mode.  The  guidance  below  applies  to  CONUS only. 6.40.1.  Ground-Based  SINCGARS.  The  objective  of  ground  SINCGARS  is  to  obtain  a jam-resistant VHF ground radio capability. 6.40.1.1.  Hopping  and  Non-hopping  Modes. coordination for use are subject to the spectrum resources available in the local area.   Frequency  assignments  and 6.40.2.  Airborne  Based  SINCGARS.  The  objective  of  Airborne  SINCGARS  is  to achieve a jam-resistant VHF voice radio capability for AF aircraft. 6.40.2.1.  Hopping mode: 6.40.2.1.1.  30-88 MHz - Below 1,000 feet elevation AGL, hopping operations are coordinated with the supporting AFC. 6.40.2.1.2.  30-54  MHz  -  Above  1,000  feet  elevation  AGL,  all  frequencies  must be coordinated with the supporting AFC. 6.40.2.1.3.  54-88  MHz  -  Above  1,000  feet  elevation  AGL,  the  SINCGARS hopping  mode  may  be  permitted  at  selected  sites  within  CONUS.  Use  can potentially  interfere  with  commercial  television,  operational  use  is  based  on  a case-by-case noninterference basis. This requires national level coordination with the FCC through proper frequency management channels. Refer to NTIA Manual for sub-bands authorized for usage when training with ground-based SINCGARS. 6.41.  Military Aircraft Collision Avoidance System (MILACAS). MILACAS is the current generation  technology  version  and  replacement  of  Traffic  Alert  and  Collision  Avoidance AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 45 System (TCAS) and Enhanced Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (ETCAS). The system  has  advanced  surveillance  functions  to  support  improved  overall  performance. MILACAS-FR  supports  improved  TCAS  performance  and  extended  range  coverage,  while MILACAS-FR  supports  formation  rendezvous  capability  utilizing  Mode  “S”  data  link  and ultimately replacing SKE on C-130 and C-17 platforms. 6.42.  Airborne IFF (AIFF). Within the US&P, the FAA requires airborne IFF/SIF systems, interrogators  and  transponders  (1030/1090  MHz)  be  Air  Traffic  Control  Radar  Beacon System,  Identification  Friend  or  Foe,  Mark  XII/Mark  XIIA,  Systems  (AIMS)  certified  and obtain spectrum supportability (refer to NTIA Manual, para 10.8.4 and ACP-190 US SUPP 1(D),  Annex  D),  and  frequency  assignments  through  the  NTIA  before  employment.    Non-certified IFF systems may require an AIMS Letter of Recommendation for FAA coordination along with a frequency assignment request. AIMS support can be obtained by contacting the AIMS SPO at email: dod.aimspo.wkflo@us.af.mil. Each specific mode of operation (Modes 1,  2,  3A/C,  4,  5,  &  S)  being  employed  must  have  frequency  authorization.  All  Mode  4 requirements  must  be  processed  through  AFSMO  to  the  DoD  Mode  4  Coordinator  and  all Mode 5 requirements must be processed through AFSMO to the national level FAA SMO. 6.43.  HAVE QUICK. The basic HAVE QUICK radio is a single channel UHF radio system modified  to  include  a  slow  frequency  hopping  capability  to  counter  jamming  threats encountered in the early 1980s. During the mid to late 1980s, HAVE QUICK II evolved as a minimal  cost  modification  of  the  basic  HAVE  QUICK  that  provided  additional  anti-jam protection,  improved  frequency  hopping  algorithms,  and  expanded  hopsets.  With  an anticipated  increase  in  jamming  threats  in  the  late  1980s  and  in  an  effort  to  refine  the system’s capabilities, the development of HAVE QUICK IIA was initiated. HAVE QUICK IIA  was  designed  to  provide  faster  frequency  hopping  rates,  additional  hopset  capability resulting from narrower channel bandwidth, and support for the transmission of digital data. Per STANAG 4372, HAVE QUICK IIA was designated as SATURN, the Second-generation Anti-jam  Tactical  UHF  Radio  for  NATO.  Although  the  US  supports  STANAG,  SATURN remains  an  unfunded  requirement  and  is  not  presently  part  of  our  radio  inventory.  The  AF uses  many  different  types  of  equipment  for  HAVE  QUICK  operations.  For  example: (AN/ARC-164/171/204/210/215/225;  AN/GRC-171B  (V)  4/206(V)  3/240;  AN/PRC-113; AN/TRC-176;  AN/TSQ-198;  AN/URC-98A/99A;  AN/VRC-83  (V)  3).  Frequencies  for  AF operations  are  set-aside  in  Annex  C  of  the  MC4EB  225-399.9  MHz  channeling  plan  for HAVE  QUICK  I  and  HAVE  QUICK  II  operations.  Additional  information  for  HAVE QUICK requirements can be found in AFTTP (I) 3-2.49, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for HAVE QUICK Radios. 6.44.  Commercial  Satellite  Communications.  The  use  of  commercial  satellite  services  is becoming more and more prevalent within DoD. DoD policy and guidance are described in CJCSI 6250.01E, Satellite Communications. 6.44.1.  Once the requirement is defined the type of radiocommunication service must be identified.    These  services  are  either  Fixed  Satellite  Service  (FSS)  or  Mobile-Satellite Service (MSS). 6.44.1.1.  FSS uses fixed earth stations and one or more space stations to route radio signals between fixed locations. FSS provides users with a leased transponder from a commercial satellite provider. 46 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 6.44.1.1.1.  Refer  to  ACP  190  US  SUPP  1  (D),  Annex  I,  DoD  Spectrum Procedures for the Use of Commercial Satellite Earth Terminals Outside United States and Possessions, for procedures and guidance regarding DoD users of earth terminals utilizing commercial FSS outside of the US&P. 6.44.1.1.2.  Users  must  contact  DISA,  through  command  channels,  for  guidance on leased FSS under the DISN Satellite Transmission Services  – Global (DSTS- G) contract. 6.44.1.2.  MSS provides for communications between mobile earth stations by means of  one  or  more  space  stations.    (A  mobile  earth  station  is  an  earth  station  operating while  in  motion  on  land,  at  sea  or  in  the  air,  or  when  halted  at  an  unspecified location.) MSS provides users a service at a monthly fee similar to telephone service. to  DoD  CIO 6.44.1.2.1.  Refer to  Assistant  Secretary  of Defense/Command,  Control,  Communications  and  Intelligence  (ASD(C3I)  and ASD/Networks  and  Information  Integration  (ASD(NII))  Policy  Letter,  DoD Policy Letter on Managing MSS. successor 6.44.1.2.2.  Since the DoD is considered as just another user, the service provider is responsible for all spectrum supportability issues, including HN coordination. 6.44.1.3.  In  some  cases,  the  FSS  and  the  MSS  include  satellite-to-satellite  links, which also  may be operated in  the  Inter-Satellite Service (ISS). Also, these services may include feeder links necessary for their operation. 6.44.2.  All equipment used to access a commercial satellite must conform to FCC Rules and  Regulations  (47  CFR  Part  25).  One  of  two  situations  must  apply.  Either  the government  owns  and  operates  the  terminal  equipment,  or  the  terminal  equipment  is leased. 6.44.2.1.  If the equipment is leased or commercially owned, the commercial provider is responsible for securing FCC Part 25 certifications and the frequency assignments. 6.44.2.2.  If the equipment is DoD owned, DoD must request Part 25 certification in order  to  obtain  spectrum  certification.  When  processing  the  EL  CID  file,  the  user must also submit the information in Table 5.   AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 47 Table 5.  FCC Part 25 Certification.

NOTE:  All frequency bands and all emission designators must be listed for each band. 48 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 6.44.2.3.  The FCC requires the following information for federal government use of commercial satellite spectrum: 6.44.2.3.1.  A letter of acceptance or agreement from the satellite service provider. 6.44.2.3.2.  A  letter  from  the  commercial  satellite  regional  coordinator  (for  the earth station location) that indicates the earth station operations are accepted. 6.44.2.3.3.  Documentation that the earth station terminal complies with Part 25. 6.44.2.3.4.  A letter of request from the federal agency for use of the commercial spectrum (it must include the information in Table 6.4.). 6.44.3.  Use outside of the US&P is subject to restrictions set forth by HN governments. Equipment  use  must  be  coordinated  through  the  appropriate  spectrum  management channels.  Users  must  verify  HN  supportability  for  equipment  use  and  satellite  service before deploying overseas with the service. 6.45.  Commercial  Mobile  Satellite  Services  (MSS)  -  Provide  full-duplex,  half-duplex,  and simplex communications services, which support any type of digital telephone transmission. These commercial systems complement DoD communications resources and are standalone terminals that can only be used on one system; for example, an Iridium® phone may only be used in the Iridium® system. MSS systems are primarily on- demand, first-come, first-served communications.  They  often  operate,  but  not  exclusively,  on  frequencies  at  3  Gigahertz (GHz) or below. Types of systems include, but are not limited to, Iridium® and Inmarsat™. 6.45.1.  Operations  in  Foreign  Countries.  Commercial  satellite  operations  in  foreign locations  require  Host  Nation  Approval  (HNA),  Terminal  Licenses/Certifications, Frequency Clearances (FCs), and/or Landing Rights (LRs). When a mission partner plans to  use satellite bandwidth  or equipment  in  foreign countries, it is  required to  follow the laws of the host nation  when operating in  the commercial spectrum. DoD or  US  policy does  not  supersede  the  laws  of  the  host  nation.  Failure  to  get  HNA  equates  to  no protection from interference, possible interception, and potential violation of international and  local  laws  (which  could  result  in  fines,  seizure  of  equipment,  and  creating  an “international incident). 6.45.2.  Inmarsat™, a commercial satellite communications company, owns and operates a fleet of L-band and Ka-band satellites providing mobile voice and data communications capability.  The  Inmarsat™  terminal  is  a  radio  communications  device  using  a  satellite link  to  interface  with  terrestrial  telephone  systems  or  other  Inmarsat™  terminals.  For procurement of Inmarsat™ hardware assets and associated services refer to AFI 17-213, Warfighting Integration Satellite Communications Resource Management. 6.45.3.  Iridium®/Enhanced  Mobile  Satellite  Service  (I/EMSS)  -  an  L-band  satellite constellation  which  provides  a  global  wireless  personnel  communications  network designed to permit narrow-band wireless transmission, (i.e., voice, data, fax, or paging), to  reach  its  destination  with  a  minimum  reliance  on  land-based  infrastructures.  Cross-linking  between  satellites  and  up/down-linking  through  the  DoD  terrestrial  satellite gateway  at  Wahiawa,  Hawaii,  enables  DoD  users  DSN  secure/non  secure  and commercial  global  access  and  coverage  capability.    Per  DoD  CIO  policy,  Iridium®  is approved  for  use  as  a  commercial  leased  service  without  a  waiver.  Neither  spectrum AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 49 certification  nor  frequency  assignments  are  required;  however,  special  procedures  exist for  the  purchase  and  use  of  Iridium®  service  and  equipment.    For  procurement  of Iridium® hardware assets and associated services refer to AFI 17-213. 6.45.4.  Users  must  contact  AFNIC/ECWM  and  DISA,  through  command  channels,  for guidance. Refer to AFI 17-213 for procedures regarding MSS resources. Refer to DISA Circular  310-130-1,  Submission  of  Telecommunications  Service  Requests,  for  the provisioning procedure. 6.45.5.  Use outside of the US&P is subject to restrictions set forth by HN governments. Equipment  use  must  be  coordinated  through  the  appropriate  spectrum  management channels.  Users  should  contact  AFNIC/ECWM  to  determine  whether  the  HN  has authorized  the  use  of  Iridium®.  Contact  the  Iridium®  POC  to  negotiate  HN  approval coordination. 6.46.  Frequency Requests in Canada or along the US/Canadian Border. The US and Canada have  made  arrangements  to  coordinate  frequency  requests  for  radio  transmitters  operating close to both countries. AFSMO obtains licenses using the data from frequency actions sent by  the  MAJCOMs.    Include  in  SFAF  Item  520  the  approximate  number  of  civilian  and military  personnel  assigned  to  the  radio  station  on  a  yearly  basis  that  directly  operate  and maintain transmitter and receiver stations. 6.47.  Permanent and Temporary Assignments. The US and Canada have made arrangements to  coordinate  frequency  requests  for  radio  transmitters  operating  in  Canada  or  near  the US/Canadian  border.  These  arrangements  are  documented  in  Section  3.4  of  the  NTIA Manual.  All  assignments  required  for  longer  than  ninety  (90)  days  that  conform  to  the arrangements will be coordinated by the IRAC with Industry Canada (IC). 6.47.1.1.  Assignments  for  AF  Radio  Stations  in  Canadian  Territory.  The  Canadian Government  (in  agreement  with  the  US  Government)  licenses  US  military  radio stations in Canada. The Canadian-US defense agreement must authorize each station; however, these radio stations do not need individual licenses. 6.47.1.1.1.  The  following  procedures  apply  to  US  military  activities  within Canada: 6.47.1.1.2.  A Canadian-US defense agreement must authorize each installation or activity. 6.47.1.1.3.  US military radio stations that support a US activity need a Canadian license. 6.47.1.1.4.  Multiple  equipment  installations,  such  as  communications  complex transmitter sites, are licensed as individual stations. 6.47.1.1.5.  Airborne  radio  stations  do  not  need  a  Canadian  license  for communications  with  a  licensed  ground  station,  but  do  require  frequency coordination and approval from the Canadian Frequency Allocation Coordinating Subcommittee  and  the  Joint  Telecommunications  Committee  for  airborne  radio operations.  AFSMO  processes  the  coordination  and  clearance  through  the MC4EB FP for AF airborne radio stations operating in Canada. 6.47.1.1.6.  Licenses  issued  to  parent  fixed  stations  include  associated  vehicular 50 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 radio stations. 6.47.1.2.  STAs. All Special Temporary Authorizations (STA) for 90 days or less will be coordinated by AFSMO with the National Defense Headquarters, Ottawa, Canada. 6.48.  Mutual  Aid.  When  the  equipment  is  owned  by  the  civil  agency  and  is  given  to  the government agency for the purpose of mutual aid, a government frequency assignment does NOT require entry into the GMF. However, corresponding assignment(s) will be entered into FRRS  with  a  copy  of  the  mutual  aid  agreement  maintained  on  file.  When  the  government entity owns fixed station equipment and the purpose of the frequency usage is "mutual aid," then the frequency assignment must be registered into the GMF. Government owned mobile or portable assets, unless used in a fixed station mode that is specifically intended to provide "mutual  aid"  support  under  a  licensed  non-federal  government  fixed  station  operating environment,  does not  have to be  registered into the GMF.  During the registration process, the  FCC  performs  coordination  required  in  the  NTIA  Manual.    In  addition,  a  Letter  of Agreement  must  be  on  file  and  have  been  signed  by  the  non-federal  government  or government parties requesting the aid agreement. 6.49.  Spectrum  support  for  RF-Dependent  Foreign  Military  or  Direct  Commercial  Sales (FMS/DCS). Before AF spectrum support can be provided, a determination must be made by the  FMS  officer  and  the  program  manager  that  AF  spectrum  support  is  required.  This determination depends in part on how the sale is being processed. 6.49.1.  Foreign Military Sales (FMS). With regard to FMS, if the US government owns the equipment and will transfer the equipment directly to a foreign government, but has never operated the equipment in the US&P and never intends to operate the equipment in the US&P, then no DD Form 1494 is required and the US  government may apply for a temporary  frequency  assignment.  The  frequency  proposal  application  will  clearly  state, using S-Note 303, that there is no intent to use the equipment in the US&P and a remark in SFAF Item 503 should state: “FMS.”  If the US government owns the equipment and has operated or intends to operate the equipment in the US&P, then the NTIA spectrum certification  and  frequency  assignment  process  must  be  followed.  If  the  equipment  is currently in the AF inventory there should be an existing DD Form 1494 or EL CID file already on file. 6.49.2.  Direct  Commercial Sales (DCS).  If  a US manufacturer owns the  platform to  be transferred  directly  to  a  foreign  government,  that  process  is  called  DCS.  Unlike  FMS sales,  DCS  are  negotiated  directly  between  the  foreign  government  and  the  US manufacturer without the Pentagon serving as an intermediary. The equipment involved is typically slightly different from the equipment that same US manufacturer built for or sold  to  the  US  government.  The  US  manufacturer  must  obtain  any  required  spectrum support  from  the  FCC  for  developmental  and  operational  tests,  if  needed.  Essentially, neither the US manufacturer nor the foreign government intends to operate the equipment within the US&P on a permanent basis. 6.49.3.  However, there exists a hybrid scenario whereby a US manufacturer makes a sale to a foreign government via the DCS process with FMS support. The foreign government is accepting equipment directly from the US manufacturer but training on that equipment will occur in the US&P through a DoD  SPO. For example, US- type aircraft/equipment being  sold  to  an  allied  country  with  training  on  that  new  aircraft/equipment  being AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 51 provided by the USAF.  These equipment  may have RF- dependent  equipment  on board that  operates  similarly  to  that  of  the  AF.  In  these  instances,  spectrum  support  must  be obtained  through  AF  channels  for  developmental  testing  and  eventually,  operational testing and training. 6.49.4.  AFSMO  will  challenge  ownership  on  all  “Experimental/Temporary”  frequency assignment proposals. If the AF does not have clear ownership, then AFSMO will ask for clarification. 6.50.  Contractor-Owned Equipment.  IAW the guidelines contained in Section 8.2.17 of the NTIA Manual, a determination must be made as to whether or not a station belongs to and is operated by the US as specified in Section 305(a) of the Communications Act of 1934. If the station  is  not  under  the  effective  control  of  a  federal  department  or  agency,  the  contractor must seek approval to operate on federal property and obtain spectrum support according to the  FCC  and  provision  of  para  8.2.47,  Shared  Federal/Non-Federal  Radio  Systems,  of  the NTIA Manual. 6.50.1.  If the AF has accepted and taken possession/ownership of the equipment then the AF must apply for spectrum support through the NTIA process. If the equipment is being manufactured  under  direct  AF  contract,  the  AF  must  provide  spectrum  support  through the NTIA process. 6.50.2.  If the equipment being supported is not in direct support of an AF contract, then the  contractor  must  apply  to  the  FCC  for  the  license  to  develop/test/operate  the equipment. 6.51.  Land Mobile Radio (LMR) 30-88, 138-144, 148-150.8, 162-174, 380-399.9, and 406-420  MHz.  Because  of  extreme  congestion  in  the  162-174  MHz  band,  new  LMR  frequency assignments are usually made in the 138-144, 380-399.9, or 406.1-420 MHz bands unless use of  another  band  is  needed  for  operational  reasons.  No  one  solution  works  everywhere; therefore,  to  ensure  LMR  frequencies  are  available  before  deploying  equipment  overseas, MAJCOMs  must  contact  the  appropriate  service  component  for  guidance.  The  following conditions, restrictions and special provisions apply: 6.51.1.  The 29.89-50 MHz band. Refer to the Supplement to Manual of Regulations and Procedures  for  Federal  Radio  Frequency  Management,  August  2009.  Government  and non-government  agencies  share  this  band  and  available  frequencies  are  very  limited. Frequency channels begin with 29.90 MHz and move up the band in 20 kHz increments. 6.51.2.  The 138-144 MHz band. The military services are the primary users in this band. Channels begin with 138.0125 MHz and move up the band in 12.5 kHz increments. 6.51.2.1.  All  equipment  in  this  band  must  operate  within  a  12.5  kHz  narrowband channel. 6.51.3.  148-150.8  MHz  band.  This  band  is  allocated  for  non-government  mobile- satellite (earth-to-space) operations, on a shared basis with government stations. 6.51.3.1.  All  equipment  in  this  band  must  operate  within  a  12.5  kHz  narrowband channel. 6.51.4.  162-174  MHz  band.  Refer  to  the  Supplement  to  Manual  of  Regulations  and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management, August 2009. This band is used 52 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 primarily  by  non-military  government  agencies.  AF  users  will  satisfy  new  LMR  and pager requirements from other frequency bands. Channels begin with 162.000 MHz and move up the band in 12.5 kHz increments. 6.51.4.1.  All  equipment  in  this  band  must  operate  within  a  12.5  kHz  narrowband channel. 6.51.4.2.  AF assignments in the 162-174 MHz band are only made when: 6.51.4.2.1.  The  frequency  is  needed  for  dual-channel  operation  with  an  existing net. 6.51.4.2.2.  The  frequency  of  an  existing  net  must  be  changed  because  of interference problems. 6.51.4.2.3.  An  existing  assignment  is  shared  with  another  unit  at  the  same location. 6.51.5.  The 406.1-420 MHz band. Refer to the Supplement to Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management, August 2009. This band is used primarily by non-military agencies. Channels begin with 406.0125 MHz and move up the band in 12.5 kHz increments. 6.51.5.1.  All  equipment  in  this  band  must  operate  within  a  12.5  kHz  narrowband channel. 6.51.6.  Off-channel  Assignment.  AF  users  will  adjust  existing  off-channel  assignments within the US&P that do not conform with the MC4EB channeling plan (e.g., 148.065 or 150.195) as soon as possible. 6.51.6.1.  Spectrum  managers  at  all  levels  should  look  for  practical,  economical opportunities to realign such off-channel frequency assignments. 6.51.6.2.  The following special provisions apply to AF users of LMR frequencies not conforming to the MC4EB channeling plan: 6.51.6.2.1.  When  an  AF  unit  is  planning  to  replace  off-channel  equipment,  the commander  must  determine  whether to  obtain  an  on-channel  frequency assignment before the equipment is ordered. 6.51.6.2.2.  When  an  off-channel  LMR  net  is  receiving  interference  from  an  on- channel system and a frequency change is the most economical way to solve the problem, change the off-channel net. 6.51.6.2.3.  If  all  the  equipment  on  an  off-channel  net  is  turned  in,  delete  the frequency  assignment  immediately.  Do  not  reserve  the  off-channel  frequency assignment for a new unit. 6.52.  Narrowbanding.  AF  owned  or  leased  LMR  systems  operating  in  the  US&P  in  the bands in the 138-150.8, 162-174, 380-399.9, and 406.1-420 MHz bands must be narrowband capable. Any AF system that is not narrowband compliant will operate on a NIB to all other narrowband users. 6.53.  Trunked  Land  Mobile  Radio  (TLMR)  Systems.  All  TLMR  systems  require  SPS approval prior to the application for frequency assignment. Installation of a TLMR requires AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 53 consolidation  of  all  TLMR  nets.  Federal  agencies  managing  TLMRs  shall  allow  access  by other federal agencies where such access is technically and operationally feasible. All TLMR proposal  requests  for  operation  in  the  US&P  must  include  a  current  SPS  and  IRAC  docket number.  Delete  conventional  frequencies  as  you  receive  approval  for  the  new  narrowband frequencies. 6.54.  Receive-Only Systems. Though these systems do not require MC4EB coordination, if interference  protection  is  required  then  submit  a  DD  Form  1494  via  HNSWD-O  for O’CONUS or anEL CID file for US&P to: 6.54.1.  Provide interference protection, update SXXI, and conduct EMC studies. 6.54.2.  Process  coordination  contours  for  the  NTIA  Manual  for  operational  (Stage  4) receive-only satellite communications terminals. 6.54.3.  Coordinate  spectrum  requirement  through  CCMD  channels  via  Host  Nation Spectrum Worldwide Database-Online (HNSWD-O). 6.55.  Commercial  Antennas  on  Federal  Property.  Commercial  vendors  may  request  the installation of commercial  antennas on AF  property. To  ensure no  adverse impacts  to DoD systems,  commanders  and/or  agency  directors  shall  coordinate  requests  through  the  Base Civil  Engineering  Real  Property  Office  for  the  placement  of  new  telecommunications services on AF property. The vendor  will provide information  to  JSC for an EMI  radiation hazard  analysis  at  their  own  expense.  The  ISM  may  facilitate  in  these  procedures.  Refer  to AFI 32-9003for additional information. 6.56.  Built-In  Test  Equipment.  With  the  exception  of  GPS  re-radiating  equipment,  this equipment  does  not  require  spectrum  certification  unless  it  exceeds  the  technical  criteria  in the  NTIA  Manual  or  if  the  intended  use  is  outside  the  US&P.  Frequency  assignments  are required for built-in test equipment. 6.57.  Electronic Warfare (EW). EW is a military action involving the use of electromagnetic and  directed  energy  to  control  the  electromagnetic  spectrum  or  to  attack  the  enemy.  EW consists  of  three  aspects:  electronic  attack  (EA),  electronic  protection  (EP),  and  electronic warfare support (EWS). 6.57.1.  EW, in general, and EA, in particular, is not recognized as an authorized service by  the  National  Level  approval  authority,  (i.e.  NTIA  and  FCC).  Additionally,  there  are strict controls for the use of frequency bands controlled or shared with the FAA because of safety-of-life issues relating to  commercial  aviation  flight  routes  and terminals. With proper coordination, EA may be performed under the condition that harmful interference will not be caused to authorized services. 6.57.2.  Performing  EA  for  Testing,  Training  and  Exercises  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada. Frequency  bands  are  not  allocated  for  EW  operations,  testing  or  training.  Therefore,  it will  be  necessary  to  coordinate  planned  EW  testing  and  training  events  using  the  EA approval  process  defined  in  CJCSM  3212.02  (Series),  Performing  Electronic  Attack  in the  United  States  and  Canada  for  Tests,  Training,  and  Exercises,  and  CJCSM  3212.03 (Series),  Performing  Tests,  Training,  and  Exercises  Impacting  the  Global  Positioning System (GPS) in the United States and Canada. These procedures are recognized by the 54 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 NTIA  as  the  official  guidance  for  coordination  and  frequency  clearance  procedures  for performing EA. 6.57.3.  AFSMO is the Air Force approval authority for EA and jamming requests for AF EW events within the US&P and Canada. EA requests for frequency clearance outside of the US&P and Canada is accomplished by submitting the EA request according to theater policies and procedures. 6.58.  Commercial  off-the-Shelf  (COTS).  COTS  devices,  as  defined  by  48  CFR  12.103, including devices with FCC Type Acceptance, require spectrum supportability either through the  NTIA  SPS  or  MC4EB  process.    Not  all  COTS  devices  are  considered  non-licensed devices; Chapter 10 of the NTIA manual denotes the factors for determining which stage of system review is required.  COTS devices require a frequency assignment to be registered in the GMF  and/or the DoD FRRS.  Note:   The use of  aeronautical  COTS  systems  will bring significant risks associated with the use of these products in a military environment.  Mission characteristics  must  be  taken  in  consideration  before  procuring  and  placing  these  systems into operation. 7.  Windmill Operations. 7.1.  The advent of large (250-foot-tall and greater) wind turbines, or “windmills” for power production  has  raised  the  issue  of  possible  effects  on  the  performance  of  ATC  radars.  Windmills  with  heights  up  to  700  feet  above  ground  level  are  being  installed  on  sites throughout  the  United  States.  As  noted  in  the  NTIA  Technical  Report  TR-08-454, Assessment of the Effects of Wind Turbines on Air Traffic Control Radars, radar reflections can mask the true radar return.  http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/pub/ntia-rpt/08-454/. 7.2.  Due  to  potential  flight  obstruction  concerns,  windmill  site  developers  are  required  to coordinate proposed site locations near or  close to ATC facilities with  the FAA. Para 7.2.1 describes  the  coordination  process  with  potentially  affected  MAJCOMs  become  aware  of proposed windmill sites within their area of operations. 7.3.  In  addition  to  the  FAA  Web  Portal  notification  process  outlined  in  AFI  90-2001, AFSMO  receives  notifications  from  the  NTIA  and  in  turn  forwards  to  all  affected MAJCOMS. If a MAJCOM Encroachment Committee has concerns regarding the proposed location of a wind turbine site, it will return a proposed rebuttal and contact information via AFSMO.  The  NTIA  will  compile  concerns  and  prepare  an  official  Response  Letter  to  the Windmill  developer.  As  required,  the  involved  MAJCOM/Installation  Encroachment Committee may engage the Windmill developer to resolve conflicts. If the MAJCOM cannot resolve the identified concerns with the Windmill  developer, then these concerns should be elevated to HAF for assistance. 8.  Electromagnetic Spectrum Data Sharing 8.1.  The EME is a critical shared joint-use environment that must be effectively controlled in order to enable successful military operations. In order to effectively share spectrum data, it must be timely, comprehensive, relevant, accurate, and trusted. 8.2.  DoDI  8320.05,  Electromagnetic  Spectrum  Data  Sharing.  Establishes  policy,  assigns responsibilities,  and  provides  procedures  for  the  collection,  provision,  maintenance,  and AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 55 sharing of timely, comprehensive, relevant, accurate, and trusted data used to characterize SD systems and define the EME. 8.3.  Electromagnetic  Spectrum  Data  Community  of  Interest  (COI):  A  COI  is  a  strategic approach for developing the agreements necessary for meaningful information exchange, and doing so collaboratively across the community of stakeholders who share a common interest. The  spectrum  data  COI  is  established  and  functions,  IAW  DoD  8320.02-G,  Guidance  for Implementing  Net-Centric  Data  Sharing,  to  ensure  spectrum-related  data  identification, standardization, collection, provision, and maintenance is provided for meeting the needs of the DoD. 8.4.  AF spectrum stakeholders and SD system developers shall: 8.4.1.  Implement  procedures  to  ensure  that  all  data  generated  at  each  stage  of  the spectrum certification process is complete, accurate, and in conformance with published spectrum-related data standards. (T-0) 8.4.2.  Ensure  that  all  spectrum-related  data  for  SD  system(s)  is  submitted  via  the  DoD data  capture  describing  supportability  tracking  and  data  maintenance  capabilities throughout the SD system life cycle. (T-0) 8.4.3.  Provide  AFSMO  with  operational  lessons  learned  and  spectrum-related  data feedback. 8.4.4.  Ensure that all current and future spectrum-related data assets are made consistent with DoDI 8320.05. 9.  Electromagnetic Spectrum Reallocation 9.1.  In 2010, the Secretary of the Air Force directed the AFSMO to create and standardize a process  for  all  federal  spectrum  reallocation  events.  In  response,  an  Air  Force  Smart Operations  for  the  Twenty-First  Century  (AFSO21)  event  was  held  that  brought  together stakeholders  from  the  operations,  intelligence,  logistics,  spectrum,  acquisition,  program management, cost, and joint communities. The output of the AFSO21 event was a standard model  to  effectively  identify  every  SD  system  and  mission  that  can  be  impacted  by  the reallocation of spectrum. 9.1.1.  Reallocation is a change to the “U.S. National Table of Frequency Allocations.” A reallocation  event  could  impact  any  frequency  band  that  is  currently  allocated  as exclusively  “federal”  spectrum,  redesignating  it  to  exclusively  “non-federal”  spectrum (i.e., commercial use only and a complete loss of Air Force licensed access). 9.1.2.  Alternatively, a reallocation event could change the status of some portion of the spectrum  from  exclusively  “federal”  to  “shared–federal/non-federal.”  The  Air  Force, DoD  and  other  federal  agencies  would  then  be  required  to  share  a  frequency  band  or bands  with  commercial  users  under  a  regulatory  sharing  agreement  or  relative  status (primary, co-primary or secondary) in a licensing arrangement.    AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 9.1.3.  Pursuant  to  federal  law,  special  conditions  apply  to  DoD  use  of  the  spectrum. These  conditions  may  impact  attempts  to  reallocate  spectrum  when  the  DoD  is  the primary  user  of  that  spectrum.    See  the  NTIA  Manual,  Section  2.3.13  for  further information. 56  WILLIAM J.

General.  This  attachment  describes  the  Air  Force  process  for  obtaining  spectrum- dependent      (SD)  system(s)  or  RF  device  certification  of  spectrum  availability,  supportability, EMC,  and  Service  Priority,  commonly  referred  to  as  Spectrum  Certification.  The  process  is usually  initiated  by  a  using  activity  for  procurement(s),  an  SD  system/device  development contractor,  PMOs,  and/or  other  acquisition  activities,  and  is  then  coordinated  through  the applicable  chain-of-command;  i.e.  organization,  Center,  MAJCOM,  to  the  AFSMO.  AFSMO evaluates EMS parametric data against applicable EMC standards and submits recommendations for certification to the MC4EB Equipment Spectrum Guidance Permanent Working Group (ESG PWG) and to the applicable host nation regulator; i.e., NTIA SPS for the U.S., for final review and certification. SD systems or devices deemed “supportable” receive certification guidance and can  either;  a)  proceed  to  the  next  acquisition  milestone,  b)  request  radio  frequency  assignment and/or use, or c) both. Spectrum Certification is required for all RF emitters including COTS and non-developmental  items,  unless  specifically  exempt;  see  Attachment  3  of  this  instruction. Spectrum  certification  is  accomplished  IAW  guidance  and  policy  specified  by  the  MC4EB Frequency  Panel  (FP),  ESG  PWG,  DoD  Instruction  4650.01,  Policy  and  Procedures  for Management  and  Use  of  the  Electromagnetic  Spectrum;  and  applicable  host  nation  regulatory conditions and policy, depending on planned use.  The certification and supportability process is shown in Figure A2.1 below. Figure A2.1.

Equipment  Exempt  from  Spectrum  Certification.  According  to  the NTIA Manual  of Regulations  and  Procedures  for  Federal  Radio  Frequency  Management;  “The  NTIA  Manual”, the following categories of equipment in the US&P are exempt from the spectrum certification process. If any devices listed below are to be used outside US&P, spectrum certification may be required by the HNs prior to procurement. A3.1.1.  47 CFR Part 15, Radio Frequency Devices.  There are provisions in Sections 7.8 and 7.9  and  Annex  K  of  the  NTIA  Manual  that  allow  federal  agencies  to  operate  systems  that conform to the FCC’s rules in 47 CFR Part 15 (which are incorporated into Annex K of the NTIA Manual) on a non-licensed, non-interference basis. A3.1.2.  47 CFR Part 18, Industrial Scientific and Medical Equipment (ISM).

IAW Section 7.5.8 of the NTIA Manual, Federal  entities  are  authorized  to  purchase  and  operate  radios  certified  by  the  FCC  in  the Family Radio  Service (FRS), pursuant  to 47 CFR Part 95, Subpart B. Federal  users will be accorded  the  same  privileges  as  non-federal  users.  Because  FRS  users  must  share  each channel  and  no  user  is  assured  protection  from  interference  caused  by  another  authorized user, Federal entities may not purchase and operate FRS radios for planned communications operations that safeguard human life or property. A3.1.4.  Built-in  test  equipment  that  does  not  exceed  the  technical  criteria  outlined  in  the NTIA manual with the exception of GPS re-radiating equipment. A3.1.5.

All  SD  equipment  that  will  be  used  by  deploying  or  garrisoned  forces  in  another  nation must be approved by the HN through the HN coordination process. While the process for gaining authorization to use SD equipment in other nations is separate and distinct from the US process, the DD Form 1494 is used to initiate the HN coordination request (HNCR). A4.2.  To ensure timely program implementation, HN coordination should begin with sufficient lead time to allow for completion of the coordination process prior to operational deadlines. A4.3.  Contents  of  the  HNCR  Package.  A  submission  package  that  is  separate  from  the  US package must be prepared. The first step is to determine the locations where the equipment will likely  operate.  Each  nation  is  aligned  under  a  CCMD  AOR  IAW  the  Unified  Command  Plan. The  CCMDs  have  unique  processes  and  some  require  more  detailed  information  than  others. However,  any  HN  coordination  package  requires  a  Foreign  Disclosure  Letter  be  submitted  to AFSMO. A4.4.  Foreign Disclosure  Letter. Determine the locations where the equipment will be used.  If this  determination  is  uncertain,  use  the  best  approximation  available.  The  data  on  a  DD  Form 1494 must be deemed releasable to these nations. To begin the process, the completed DD Form 1494  should  be  reviewed  by  the  appropriate  AF  Foreign  Disclosure  Office  (FDO).  The appropriate MAJCOM FDO will determine whether the information contained on the DD Form 1494 is releasable. If the FDO cannot make the decision, the DD Form 1494 will be forwarded through the disclosure channels to SAF/IA. Once foreign disclosure is granted, the submitter of the  DD  Form  1494  must  provide  a  letter  indicating  the  release  approval  including  the  case number to their local SMO with the foreign coordination DD Form 1494 package. The releasable data  must  accompany  the  appropriate  foreign  disclosure  release  letter.  The  foreign  disclosure release letter indicates the nations that can receive the different data. Alternatively, the FDO may specify  that  the  DD  Form  1494  may  not  be  released  to  a  HN  for  spectrum  supportability coordination,  but  that  individual  data  items  may  be  released  to  that  nation  for  the  purpose  of coordinating frequency assignments for operations within the country. A4.5.  HN  Coordination  Package.  MAJCOMs/Centers  will  submit  HNCR  to  AFSMO.    Upon receipt,  AFSMO  will  review  the  HNCR.  Once  the  United  States  Air  Force  (USAF)  HN coordinator at AFSMO has approved, the request will be uploaded to HN Spectrum Worldwide Database  Online  (HNSWDO)  for  further  review  by  the  MC4EB  ESG  Steering  Member.  Once the ESG Steering Member has approved release  of the request  to  CCMD for HN coordination, AFSMO will upload the MC4EB cover letter for the request  to  HNSWD-O. AFSMO will then release  the  request  to  CCMD  for  coordination  of  the  request  with  HNs  as  specified.  This coordination ends with HN comments being received by CCMD and entered into HNSWD-O for review  by  AFSMO.  With  the  DoD  acceptance  of  HNSWD-O  as  the  official  HN  coordination database,  HN  comments  no  longer  are  included  in  NTH  requests  for  appendage  of  such comments to MC4EB memos. Instead, these comments can be approved directly by AFSMO in HNSWD-O,  as  AFSMO  is  authorized  to  accept  HN  comments  on  behalf  of  the  USAF. HNSWDO serves as the repository for all HN comments received by CCMDs. A4.6.  Unique  HN  Coordination.  Some  countries  may  have  unique  HN  processes,  for  example Japan and Korea. These countries do not allow equipment to be coordinated for possible future AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 79 deployments.  Coordination  for  notional  equipment  use  is  not  permitted.  As  a  result,  HN coordination  with  Japan  and  Korea  has  an  associated  timeline  of  90  duty  days  after  HN comments are received to submit a frequency proposal. If no frequency proposal is submitted in that time frame then the HN coordination will have to be reinitiated. A4.7.  Submission  Procedures.  As  in  the  DD  Form  1494  process,  the  submitter’s  spectrum manager will distribute the completed HNCR package to the spectrum manager in the next level of the chain of command. AFSMO will provide the HNCR package to the MC4EB for tasking to the appropriate CCMD, or to the Defense Attaché Office for foreign coordination.  80 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 SPECTRUM SUPPORTABILITY RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS Attachment 5 is  available  for A5.1.  General.  The  SSRA  is  the  principal  means  by  which  the  DoD  determines  whether sufficient  spectrum the  SD  equipment  associated  with  a  proposed system/platform.  This  attachment  describes  the  Air  Force  Spectrum  Supportability  Risk Assessment (AF SSRA) process, applies to all AF SD system acquisitions, and is intended to be used in conjunction with the guidance and suggested tasks provided in DoD Instruction (DoDI) 4650.01, Policy and Procedures for Management and Use of the Electromagnetic Spectrum. A5.1.1.  This  instruction  applies  to  all  Air  Force  SD  program  managers  (PMs),  materiel developers,  program  executives,  and  program  offices  (POs).    In  addition,  the  roles  of  the SSRA  author  and  the  PM  include  developing  relationships  with  the  appropriate  MAJCOM spectrum  management  office  (SMO)  and  AFSMO  to  familiarize  personnel  in  these  offices with  the  nature  of  the  particular  SSRA  and  to  facilitate  the  collection  and  exchange  of information  during  the  preparation  of  the  SSRA.    All  AF  SD  systems  are  required  to complete  SSRA  submissions  for  each  Milestone  decision.    The  content  of  the  SSRA  to  be completed differs between developmental and non-developmental programs.  To support the delivery  and  completion  of  SSRAs  a  set  of  clear  coherent  directions  are  provided  to  assist SSRA authors. A5.1.2.  SSRAs  should  be  created  in  an  electronic  format,  preferably  using  the  Microsoft Office  suite.  The  electronic  version  of  the  SSRA  should  be  used  throughout  coordination, review, and submission.  Use of the portable document file (pdf) format should  be  avoided. Prior to the presentation of the completed SSRA to the milestone decision authority (MDA), the PM will approve and forward the SSRA to the MAJCOM-A6, who after their review and concurrence actions will forward the package to  the AF/SSRA review authority at AFSMO who  will  complete  their  review  and  concurrence  actions  and  submit  the  package  to  the Director  of  AFSMO.  After  receiving  AFSMO/CC  concurrence  with  appropriate  signatures the package will be submitted to the AF/CIO for their completion of the review actions. The PM  is  expected  to  maintain  a  file  version  control  scheme  that  will  ensure  changes  to  the SSRA are properly recorded during the preparation and coordination of the document. A5.2.  AF  SSRA.  The  SSRA  is  needed  to  ensure  the  Air  Force  procurement  system  uses  due diligence  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  its  SD  equipment  will  be  able  to  obtain  access  to sufficient radio frequency spectrum in the electromagnetic environment required while using that spectrum efficiently. The Air Force owns, manages, and develops SD equipment and capabilities and  must  plan  for  future  SD  equipment  configurations.  Given  the  limited  frequency  spectrum available  for  DoD  SD  equipment,  it  is  vital  that  the  Air  Force  is  cognizant  of  all  existing  and planned system/platform SD equipment. SD equipment is currently regulated and certified in the US&P  through  the  National  Telecommunications  and  Information  Agency  (NTIA)  review  and certification  process.  International  DoD  SD  equipment  usage  is  managed  through  Host  Nation Coordination  (HNC)  and  International  Telecommunications  Union  (ITU)  conferences, agreements, and treaties. A5.2.1.  DoDI  4650.01  and  the  “Joint  Service  Guide  for  the  Production  of  a  Spectrum Supportability Risk Assessment (SSRA)” are the principal sources for SSRA requirements and procedures.  The SSRA is  a very important  DoD and Air Force spectrum management tool AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 81 that  helps  identify  spectrum  issues  that  affect  the  DoD  and  Air  Forces’  ability  to  field system(s)/platform(s)  that  meets  SD  equipment  design  requirements.    Once  all  spectrum issues have been identified, an assessment of the spectrum supportability risk associated with the system/platform including any proposed mitigations is provided.  For major SD systems, SSRAs  are  required  at  key  MS  decision  points,  as  described  in  para  A5.4,  as  the  system makes its way through the acquisition review lifecycle. However, all  SD developers should identify  and  mitigate  regulatory,  technical,  and  operational  spectrum  supportability  risks using  suggested  tasks  in  this  attachment.    The  SSRA  document  title  typically  includes  the MS for which the SSRA is submitted. A5.2.2.  An SSRA is composed of four components and an executive summary. The four are the  Regulatory,  Technical,  Electromagnetic  Environment  Effects  (E3),  and  Operational components. These components are combined as needed to form a single risk assessment for the  applicable  system  or  platform  to  meet  the  successive  MS  review  requirements.  The Executive  Summary  provides  a  synopsis  of  the  overall  assessment  for  the  system/platform SD  equipment  at  that  MS  point  in  the  acquisition  review  cycle.  The  linking  of  the  SSRA requirement with the program MS approval process ensures that spectrum availability issues are addressed throughout the program lifecycle. A5.2.2.1.  The  Regulatory  component  addresses  the  equipment  spectrum  certification (ESC) stage and status and the relative status of the acquisition with respect to the radio services authorized within the Tables of Frequency Allocations (TOAs) of the U.S.  and intended  HNs.  The  Regulatory  component  of  the  SSRA  for  a  space  station  should  also identify ITU registrations for other space stations registered in the frequency band being sought  for  operation.  As  the  system  matures,  the  Regulatory  component  should  contain additional  spectrum  insights  from  the  ESC  and  HNC  processes.  Assess  whether frequency  management  regulations  are  complied  with  and  spectrum  is  available  for operations in the host nation. A5.2.2.2.  The combined Technical/E3 component. The Technical component focuses on candidate technologies and available technical parameters, such as system type, platform type,  bandwidth  requirements,  etc,  to  generate  initial  quantification  of  potential  mutual interactions.  DoD  Components  developing  or  acquiring  SD  systems,  including  CI  and NDI, are required to perform limited E3 assessments as part of the SSRA; as a minimum, EMC and EMI are to be addressed to determine the potential for interactions between the proposed  system  and  its  anticipated  operational  EME.  The  assessment  also  includes  an analysis  to  determine  the  possible  effect  on  operational  performance  as  a  result  of  any EM interaction. Analyses of additional E3 disciplines (e.g. HERP, HERF, HERO, EMP, lightning,  ESD,  etc)  may  be  required;  contact  the  MILDEP  SMO  for  guidance.  The combined  Technical/E3  component  assesses  the  ability  of  the  platform  or  system  to operate without intersystem and intrasystem interference. A5.2.2.3.  The  Operational  component  assesses  the  full  complement  of  SD  systems anticipated to be in the operational environment. As data or hardware becomes available, analyses  should  be  performed  and/or  updated  to  determine  if  the  system  meets  its operational performance requirements as specified in the Joint Urgent Operational Need Statement (JUONS) or Operational Need Statement (ONS), or the acquisition documents (e.g.  ICD,  CDD,  CPD,  or  ISP).  F-D  separations  and  mitigation  measures  and/or  TTPs that may be needed to reduce risks to acceptable levels should also be identified. 82 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 A5.3.  Preparing  the  SSRA.  SD  system  developers,  PMOs,  and/or  acquisition  activities  will generate  and  submit  an  SSRA  report  before  each  acquisition  milestone  using  the  outline presented in Table A2.1 and tasks provided in DoDI 4650.01, Enclosure 3; Table 2.

Consider  the  SSRA  development  cost  in  budget  justification  during  the procurement phase of major telecommunication, broadcast, radar, and similar systems. A5.4.  Milestones and submission timelines.  The information below summarizes by milestone the  key  SSRA  components,  their  contents,  and  timelines.  The  submission  and  review  process follows the two-phased order shown in Figure A5.1 below. A5.4.1.  As the program progresses through its lifecycle Milestone (MS) events the following requirements must be met. A5.4.1.1.  At MS A, the initial Regulatory component of the SSRA should be completed and should include a listing of the equipment certification status  of the system/platform SD  equipment.  At  MS  A,  Technical  and  E3  issues  of  concern  to  the  PO  should  be addressed  (such  as  SD  equipment  proposed  for  operation  in  frequency  bands  not allocated  for  the  radio  service  of  the  SD  equipment).  An  initial  description  of  the system/platform operational environment should also be presented at MS A. A5.4.1.2.  At MS B greater detail should be provided for the Regulatory, Technical & E3, and  Operational  components  of  the  SSRA.  HNC  status,  radio  frequency  characteristics, and concept of operations information should all be in the MS B SSRA. 84 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 Figure A5.1.  SSRA Workflow. A5.4.1.3.  At  MS  C,  full  assessments  of  spectrum  supportability  risks  should  be completed for the Regulatory, Technical & E3, and Operational components. The MS C spectrum supportability risk assessments need to be fully completed for each component in order that the MDA can decide whether or not to approve low-rate initial production. Consequently, the MS C SSRA should contain an overall Executive Summary spectrum supportability assessment to aid in the MDA MS C decisions.  the  spectrum  supportability  of  new  versions  and/or  upgrades A5.4.1.4.  The  full  rate  production  (FRP)  Milestone  is  the  means  by  which  the  MDA tracks the system/platform  and  its  SD  equipment.  Only  those  SSRA  components  affected  by  the new version and/or upgrade are revised for FRP. to A5.4.2.  All SSRAs are to be initiated into the review process from the PM to the appropriate Wing, Center, or MAJCOM Spectrum Management Office not later than ninety days prior to the  scheduled  Milestone  decision.  Each  of  the  reviewing  organizations  must  ensure  their review is properly completed while remaining cognizant of the time the other reviewers will need  to  complete  the  process  to  ensure  the  MDA  receives  the  SSRA  in  time  to  meet  the scheduled Milestone decision. This review process timeline is applicable for all MS SSRAs. (T-2) A5.5.  Reviewing  the  SSRA.  The  information  below  summarizes  the  review  process  actions after the PM has submitted the SSRA. A5.5.1.  MAJCOM Spectrum Management Office will: AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 85 A5.5.1.1.

Security  Classification.  This  attachment  is  a  reference  used  for  Air  Force  specific frequency assignment requirements. As a reference it explains the handling and retention of the classification of frequency assignments, whereas DODM 5200.01and AFI 16-1404 are general in nature. This attachment is reference only and is not to be used as a classification source. A6.1.1.  Primarily  the  association  with  the  function  they  support  determines  security classification of DoD and Federal Government frequency assignments and the information in them.  Classify individual data items according to DODM 5200.01and and AFI 16-1404. A6.2.  Individual Air Force Frequency Assignments. A6.2.1.  The following frequency assignment information, standing alone or in combination and not associated with  any other assignment information, is UNCLASSIFIED. Mark these items as (U) in the SFAF. A6.2.1.1.  Overall classification of the frequency assignment (SFAF Item 005). A6.2.1.2.  Security classification modification (SFAF Item 006). A6.2.1.3.  Type of action (SFAF Item 010). A6.2.1.4.  Agency  serial  number  (SFAF  Item  102).  Note:  AFT  serial  numbers  are  for STAs only. A6.2.1.5.  IRAC docket number (SFAF Item 103). A6.2.1.6.  List serial number (SFAF Item 105). A6.2.1.7.  Serial replaced, delete date (SFAF Item 106). A6.2.1.8.  Docket number of older authorizations (SFAF Item 108). A6.2.1.9.  Operating  frequency  or  frequency  band  and  excluded  frequency  or  frequency band (SFAF Items 110 and 111). A6.2.1.10.  Agency (SFAF Item 200). A6.2.1.11.  Command (SFAF Item 204). A6.2.1.12.  IRAC Notes (SFAF Item 500). A6.2.1.13.  Frequency action officer (SFAF Item 701). A6.2.1.14.  Control/request number (SFAF Item 702). A6.2.2.  Classify other assignment information, standing alone or in combination with other information  (including  A2.2.1.),  according  to  DODM  5200.01  and  AFI  16-1404  by  the appropriate  classification  authority.  Include  the  appropriate  classification  marking  with  the corresponding SFAF Item. A6.3.  Lists of Air Force Frequency Assignments. A6.3.1.  Most individual frequency assignment records in the Radio Frequency Authorization (RFA)  are  individually  unclassified,  classify  the  total  RFA  according  to  the  highest AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 87 classification  level  of  the  assignments  it  contains.    Lists  (two  or  more  frequencies)  of unclassified frequency assignment records in a given range of frequencies, or in a given area, can  be  categorized  as  sensitive,  but  unclassified  because  they  may  provide  information leading to the disclosure of military or national security-related operations and scientific and technological  matters  relating  to  national  security.  These  lists  can  indicate  the  overall strategic telecommunications capabilities of the US, and their disclosure could cause damage to  national  security.  The  continued  protection  of  this  information  is  essential  to  national security  because  it  pertains  to  communications  security  and  reveals  vulnerabilities  and capabilities. Its unauthorized disclosure can reasonably be expected to result in nullifying the effectiveness of telecommunications networks and the capability of the US. A6.3.2.  The MC4EB-M-001-12, dated 9 Nov 12, gives guidance on classifying compilations of frequency assignment records.  Based on this guidance: A6.3.2.1.  Classify  RFAs  or  frequency  lists  at  the  highest  level  of  any  individual frequency assignment it contains. A6.3.2.2.  When  RFAs  or  frequency  lists  contain  the  aggregation  of  UNCLASSIFIED DoD,  MILDEP,  or  NSA  frequency  assignment  records,  classify  it  CONFIDENTIAL, except as exempted by para A2.5. A6.3.2.3.  An  RFA  or  frequency  list  containing  only  UNCLASSIFIED  assignments  of one  unit  or  location  is  considered  UNCLASSIFIED.  For  example,  to  select  all  records where  SFAF  data  Item  200  (Agency)  =  USAF  would  result  in  a  CONFIDENTIAL aggregate  list;  whereas,  select  all  records  where  SFAF  Item  301  (Transmitter  Location) or  401  (Receiver  Location)  =  Hill  would  result  in  an  UNCLASSIFIED  aggregate  list. Users  that  plan  to  operate  in  an  UNCLASSIFIED  environment  should  select  from  the FRRS only UNCLASSIFIED records applicable to their operational requirements. A6.4.  Marking. A6.4.1.  All DoD frequency assignment material must contain proper warnings/markings, as outlined,  whether  computer-generated  or  manually  applied.  Mark  DoD  data  extracted  from frequency  assignment  databases  with  one  of  the  following  warning  statements,  depending upon which category is applicable. A6.4.2.  Documents/Material  containing  SECRET/CONFIDENTIAL  frequency  assignment or  equipment  spectrum  certification  records  and  UNCLASSIFIED  “sensitive”  DoD frequency assignment or equipment spectrum certification records /data will be marked IAW current  security  directives    under  Section  4  of  the  MC4EB-M-001-12  and  carry  markings according to existing DoD security regulations and AFI 16-1404.

The frequency assignment review process is normally accomplished by reviewing within a  given  year  all  frequency  assignments  that  were  last  reviewed  during  the  previous  five  to  ten years, or SFAF Line 143: Revision Date. A7.2.  Assignment reviews shall be accomplished by the revision date (SFAF 143) plus: A7.2.1.  Five years for most assignments. A7.2.2.  Ten years for those assignments considered by the Aeronautical Assignments Group (AAG). A7.2.3.  Ten  years  for  assignments  in  which  all  the  space  stations  are  in  a  geostationary- satellite orbit. A7.2.4.  Five  years  for  assignments  which  include  one  or  more  space  stations  in  a  non- geostationary satellite orbit. A7.3.  During the review the unit/organization responsible for the assignment will determine for each frequency assignment: A7.3.1.  Whether the assignment is essential to meet the agency's requirements; and. A7.3.2.  If so, whether other existing assignments will meet the requirements; and, A7.3.3.  If not, whether the justification for and description of the assignment under review, are still accurate; and, A7.3.4.  If so, whether the assignment is completely up to date. A7.4.  Each  unit/organization  responsible  for  the  assignment  will  maintain  the  contact information of the person responsible for validating that the radio frequency is still in use. This information will include their name and date of verification for each 5 year or 10 year review and will be accessible to AFSMO via SXXI. A7.5.  An  assignment  is  completely  up  to  date  if  it  contains  in  the  proper  fields  all  of  the particulars required by the NTIA Manual and applicable DoD and AF policy. A7.6.  Responsible  spectrum  management  entities  will  submit  DELETION  actions  for  those assignments that are not qualified for retention under A7.3.1 above. Those assignments qualified for retention, but not up to date IAW the particulars of the NTIA manual and applicable DoD and AF policy, will be updated by submitting a MODIFICATION action using the procedures found in the NTIA Manual, Chapter 9. A7.7.  Assignments  qualified  for  retention,  and  completely  up  to  date  IAW  the  NTIA  Manual, DoD and AF policy, will be certified by the NTIA Frequency Assignment Subcommittee.  AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 91 AERONAUTICAL RADIONAVIGATION SPECTRUM MATTERS FOR FAA AND DOD AFCS Attachment 8 A8.1.  Aeronautical Radionavigation A8.1.1.  FAA coordination of AAG and Radar Bands (190-285 kHz, 285-435 kHz, 510-535 kHz,  74.800-75.200  MHz,  108.000-121.9375  MHz,  123.5875-128.8125  MHz,  132.0125-137.000 MHz, 328.6-335.4 MHz, 978-1020 MHz, 1030 MHz, 1031-1087 MHz, 1090 MHz, 1104-1146 MHz, 1157-1213 MHz 5000-5250 MHz) and Air Traffic Control frequencies in the  Military  Assignment  Group  (MAG)  Bands  (225-328.6  and  335.4-399.9  MHz).    The coordination of unclassified frequencies will be done through the FAA WebFCR (Frequency Coordination Request) portal located at https://webfcr.faa.gov. A8.1.2.  The FAA coordinator provides a coordination serial number that must be entered in Standard Frequency Action Format (SFAF) Item 501 as a M018 note. A8.1.3.  AF  installations  having  an  ATC  support  agreement  with  a  FAA  facility  for  local control of civil aircraft will be assigned suitable VHF frequencies for control of civil aircraft. A8.1.4.  Agencies  requiring  frequencies  in  the  bands  listed  in  the  NTIA  Manual,  Annex  D, will  coordinate  all  actions  with  HQ  FAA  frequency  coordinators  listed  in  Table  1  of  that Annex.  92 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 Attachment 9 AIR FORCE - DOD AREA FREQUENCY COORDINATORS FOR NATIONAL AND SERVICE TEST AND TRAINING RANGES A9.1.  This  enclosure  describes  duties  and  responsibilities  of  the  Air  Force  DoD  AFC  for minimizing  EMI  at,  among,  and  within  the  line-of-sight  of  three  Air  Force  test  and  training ranges and with all civil and non-military federal activities within the AF DoD AFC responsible area  of  responsibility  (AOR).  Crucial  to  the  frequency  coordination  process  is  developing  and maintaining  a  cadre  of  highly  skilled,  qualified  and  professional  frequency  coordinator personnel.  Adequate resources are required to implement these systems and processes. A9.2.  For the purpose of these terms of reference the following definitions apply: A9.2.1.  Frequency  coordination:  the  process  of  obtaining  approval  to  use  the  EMS  via arrangements  and  technical  liaison  for  the  purpose  of  minimizing  harmful  interference through cooperative use of the EMS.  To be effective, the coordination must extend through the planning, proposal, and actual in-use phases of radio frequency utilization. A9.2.2.  Harmful  interference:  interference  which  endangers  the  functioning  of  a  radio navigation service or of other safety services, or seriously degrades, obstructs, or repeatedly interrupts a radio communications service operating IAW the NTIA Manual. A9.2.3.  Line-of-sight (LOS): the distance to the horizon at a given height approximated by the formula: d = √2ht + √2hr (distance equals [the square root of two times the height of the transmitter antenna] plus  [the square root of two  times the height  of the  receiver antenna]), where d = LOS (miles), ht = height of the transmitter antenna in feet and hr = height of the receiver  antenna in  feet.  For purposes of this document, "LOS" includes situations  where a non-line-of-sight emitter has the capability, due to propagation and other technical factors, to interfere with a range or range-hosted system. A9.2.4.  Range equipment/systems:  range equipment refers to any SD item (e.g., transmitter, receiver)  that  is  part  of  or  organic  to  the  range  infrastructure  including,  range  telemetry, radars,  data telemetry, telecommunications systems, etc. enforcement,  medical links, installation security, law A9.2.5.  Range-hosted  equipment/systems:  refers  to  any  SD  device,  whether  stand  alone  or part  of  another  platform,  brought  to  a  range  for  research,  development,  test,  evaluation (RDT&E), training or demonstration. A9.3.  Air  Force  Major  Range  and  Test  Facility  Base.    The  Air  Force  Major  Range  and  Test Facility Base (MRTFB) is a set of test installations, facilities, and ranges which are regarded as national  assets.    These  assets  are  sized,  operated,  and  maintained  primarily  for  DoD  test  and evaluation missions.  However, the MRTFB facilities and ranges are also available to other users on  a  reimbursable  basis  such  as  U.S.  Government  Agencies  (Federal,  State  and  local),  defense contractors, commercial entities, and allied foreign governments.  Because of the wide variety of activities that may take place on the DoD Ranges, often simultaneously, the functions performed by  the  AFC  are  critical.    Facilities  comprising  the  Air  Force  MRTFB  with  AFC  oversight  are listed below, and as defined in NTIA Manual, Table 8.3.26 and Annex D. AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 93 A9.3.1.  Eastern  AFC.    45th  Space  Wing,  Air  Force  Space  Command  (AFSPC)  provides support to the Eastern AFC at Patrick AFB FL. A9.3.2.  Gulf  AFC.    96th  Test  Wing,  Air  Force  Materiel  Command  (HQ  AFMC)  provides support to the Gulf AFC at Eglin AFB FL. A9.3.3.  Nevada  AFC.    99th  Air  Base  Wing  provides  support  to  the  Nevada  AFC  at  Nellis AFB NV. A9.4.  Procedures.  The following responsibilities and procedures apply. A9.4.1.  The  MILDEPs  are  responsible  for  the  coordination  and  assignment  of  radio frequencies  in  support  of  all  military  operations  in  CONUS  and  for  the  coordination  of military spectrum use among civil and Federal agencies within the US&P. A9.4.2.  The AF DoD AFC is responsible for frequency coordination in the areas that lie in, among  and  within  line-of-sight  of  AF  range  or  range-hosted  SD  system  at  a  major  AF  test and training range, or other designated complexes.  Although AF DoD AFCs are assigned by the MILDEPs, these coordinators are responsible to OSD/CIO, and thus, are responsible for complying  with  all  provisions  of  this  publication  and  all  spectrum-related  national, departmental, joint and DoD spectrum-related regulations, instructions, manuals and policies.  AF  DoD  AFCs  will  communicate  through  proper  MILDEP  channels  to  establish  a departmental position prior to presenting an issue or subject to the OSD/CIO, MC4EB FP, or national level.  AF DoD AFCs and installation/range spectrum managers are responsible for the  compliance  of  spectrum-dependent  systems  within  their  purview  with  national,  joint, DoD and departmental procedures.  Range Commanders shall resource AFCs assigned by the MILDEPs at the range location where the AFC resides. A9.4.3.  AF DoD AFCs will ensure their range and range-hosted SD systems comply with all spectrum-related national, joint, DoD, and department regulations, instructions, manuals and policies.    AF  DoD  AFCs  are  also  responsible  for  the  operational  de-confliction  of  all  SD assets  under  their  purview  with  other  spectrum  users  through  established  frequency  de-confliction processes.  The AF DoD AFC will inform the Range or Center Commander and the  ISM  at  which  they  reside  and  to  the  Commanders  and  the  respective  ISM’s  at  other installations within the AOR of that AFC for all spectrum actions as noted above. A9.5.  The MILDEPs will ensure coordination has been accomplished with the appropriate DoD AFC  and  cognizant  base/ISM  prior  to  assignment  of  all  frequencies,  or  activation  of  any intended  EMS  use,  within,  among  or  within  line-of-sight  of  the  areas  delineated  in  para  9.4 above.    Spectrum  use  may  not  be  authorized  until  permission  is  granted  by  the  cognizant  AF DoD AFC in coordination, as necessary, with all other AF DoD AFCs – and ISM - that could be affected  by  any  MILDEP  activity.    Coordination  for  ships  and  aircraft  use  at  non-US instrumentation  sites  and  within  international  waters,  will  be  accomplished  by  the  cognizant MILDEP  with  the  appropriate  CCMDs  through  the  MC4EB  FP.    AF  DoD  AFCs  will  function within the following terms of reference and procedures.  Nothing in these terms of reference is intended  to  usurp  the  services  and/or  a  commander's  responsibilities  in  respect  to  frequency management.  However, certain responsibilities for departmental activities in an AF DoD AFC’s area of cognizance may be delegated to the AF DoD AFC by the department concerned. A9.5.1.  Objectives: 94 AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 A9.5.1.1.  To provide a radio frequency coordination system and infrastructure for DoD, national  and  service  test  and  training  ranges  and  test  sites.    Adequate  resources  are required  to  train,  staff  and  sustain  highly  qualified  individuals  able  to  perform  these functions. A9.5.1.2.  To  minimize  harmful  interference  at,  among  and  within  line-of-sight  of  all DoD,  test  and  training  ranges  and  test  sites  possibly  affected  by  any  range  owned  or range-hosted EMS use. A9.5.1.3.  To ensure compliance of range and range-hosted SD systems with all national, federal, joint  and  departmental  spectrum  management  regulations,  policies  and procedures. A9.5.1.4.

To coordinate the spectrum use of all SD systems supporting RDT&E, as well as operational and training activities, at, among, and within line-of-sight of DoD, national and service test and training ranges and test sites. A9.5.2.  AFC Responsibilities: A9.5.2.1.  AF DoD AFCs are responsible for attainment of the objectives listed above. A9.5.2.2.  AF  DoD  AFCs  are  directly  responsible  to  their  respective  MAJCOM  for administrative purposes and to OSD/CIO and MC4EB for policy guidance. A9.5.2.3.  AF  DoD  AFCs  shall  advise  each  range/center  commander  of  all  affected  test and  training  ranges  and  sites  within  the  AFC’s  AOR  of  anticipated  radio  frequency conflicts  in  proposed  and  scheduled  operations  and  tests.    Mutual  resolution  of  such conflicts is the responsibility of the commander’s concerned.  (T-2) A9.5.2.4.  AF DoD AFCs will assist the ISM, if requested, in the detection, identification and elimination of real time harmful EMI to Air Force test and training range and test site operations within their AOR. A9.5.2.5.  AF  DoD  AFCs  are  authorized  to  issue  temporary  radio  silence  directives,  or otherwise withhold  approval  to  radiate  within their AOR, for any  frequency, channel(s) or  band  of  frequencies  within  the  transmission  capability  of  any  interfering  activity  for the  period  of  time  necessary  for  any  potential  victim  operation  to  be  completed,  or  to protect civil or federal safety-of-life operations. A9.5.2.6.  Per  Title  47,  CFR,  installation  commanders,  and  all  other  personnel,  are subject  to  personal  fines  if  the  spectrum  use  of  any  unauthorized  activity  causes interference to any civil or private sector SD system.  AFI17-220  16 MARCH 2017 95 SPECTRUM SUPPORT OF AIR FORCE SPONSORED EXERCISES WITHIN US&P Attachment 10 A10.1.
