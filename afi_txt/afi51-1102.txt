Establishment  of  Guidance.  This  instruction  establishes  guidance  and  procedures  to  Air Force officials for cooperation and interaction with the United States Office of Special Counsel (OSC).  It does not establish an independent basis for any person or organization to assert a right, benefit, or privilege. 1.2.  Office  of  Special  Counsel.  OSC is an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency  whose  primary  mission  is  to  safeguard  the  merit  system  by  protecting  civilian  federal employees and applicants from PPPs, especially reprisal for whistleblowing.  The Civil Service Reform Act, as amended, codified in various sections of Title 5, United States Code (Public Law 95-454  (1978)),  the  WPA,  as  amended  by  WPEA,  Public  Law  112-199  (2012),  codified  at  5 U.S.C. §§ 1211 et seq., and 5 U.S.C. §§ 2302 et. seq., the Hatch Act, as amended by the Hatch Act Modernization Act of 2012, and USERRA provide OSC with statutory authority to conduct investigations and/or undertake other activities in the following areas: 1.2.1.  PPPs  and  Whistleblower  Protection.    OSC  receives,  investigates,  and  prosecutes allegations  of  PPPs,  with  an  emphasis  on  protecting  federal  government  whistleblowers.  OSC  seeks  corrective  action  remedies  (such  as  back  pay  and  reinstatement),  either  by negotiation or from  the United States Merit Systems  Protection Board (MSPB), for injuries suffered  by  whistleblowers  and  other  complainants.    OSC  is  also  authorized  to  file complaints at the MSPB to seek disciplinary action against civilian employees who commit PPPs. 1.2.2.  Whistleblower  Disclosures.    Pursuant  to  5  U.S.C.  §  1213,  OSC  provides  a  secure channel for federal employees, former employees and applicants for federal employment (the “Whistleblower”) to disclose workplace impropriety they believe evidences a violation(s) of law,  rule  or  regulation;  gross  mismanagement;  gross  waste  of  funds;  abuse  of  authority; and/or  a  substantial  and  specific  danger  to  public  health  or  safety  (referred  to  herein  as  a 1213  disclosure  allegation).    If  upon  receipt  of  the  complaint,  OSC  determines  there  is  a substantial likelihood that such workplace impropriety occurred, OSC is required to refer the matter  to  the  head  of  the  respective  agency  for  investigation  under  section  1213(c).    (1213 Disclosure Investigation).  OSC may also refer whistleblower disclosures to the head of the agency under section 1213(g). (See Chapter 3).  Upon receipt of OSC’s 1213(c) referral, the head of the agency is required to conduct an investigation and to submit a written report to OSC (1213 Disclosure Report) in accordance with statutory requirements.  Upon completion of its review process, OSC will submit the 1213 Disclosure Report to the President and to the agency’s  congressional  oversight  committees,  as  well  as  publish  a  copy  of  the  1213 Disclosure Report on OSC’s public webpage.  [Note:  Complaints disclosing alleged PPPs in violation  of  5  U.S.C.  §  2302  are  investigated  by  OSC  under  their  statutory  authority  to investigate allegations of PPPs and whistleblower reprisal. (See ¶ 1.2.1.).] 1.2.3.  Hatch  Act.    The  Hatch  Act  prohibits  civilian  federal  employees  from  engaging  in impermissible  political  activity.    OSC  promotes  compliance  with  the  legal  restrictions  on political activity by providing advisory opinions, conducting investigations, issuing warning letters  to  employees,  and  prosecuting  Hatch  Act  violations  before  the  MSPB.    OSC has   8  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015 exclusive  jurisdiction  to  investigate  and  prosecute  complaints  alleging  a  violation  of  the Hatch Act.  The Hatch Act does not apply to military members. 1.2.4.  USERRA.    USERRA  ensures  that  persons  who  serve  or  have  served  in  the  Armed Forces,  including  Reserve,  National  Guard  or  other  “uniformed  service”  (1)  are  not disadvantaged in their civilian career because of this service, (2) are promptly reemployed in their  civilian  jobs  upon  their  return  from  duty;  and  (3)  are  not  discriminated  against  in employment  based  on  past,  present  or  future  military  service.    OSC  protects  the  civilian employment and reemployment rights of veterans and members of the Guard and Reserve by enforcing USERRA.  OSC receives and investigates complaints of USERRA violations and may prosecute certain USERRA complaints involving federal executive agencies before the MSPB.

Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Manpower,  Personnel  and  Services  (AF/A1)  is  responsible for providing SAF/GC with military and civilian personnel policy guidance for OSC issues. 2.9.  Civilian Personnel Offices are responsible for: 2.9.1.  Ensuring  that  local  training  for  all  civilian  personnel  specialists,  attorneys,  and management officials covers OSC functions and activities; 2.9.2.  As  appropriate,  assisting  management  officials  with  implementing  corrective  and disciplinary actions. 2.10.  Air Force Commanders and Management Officials.

(T-0) [Remainder of Page Intentionally Blank]   16  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015 Chapter 3 WHISTLEBLOWER DISCLOSURE CASES 3.1.  OSC  Referral.  Pursuant to their authority under 5 U.S.C. §§ 1213(c) and (g), OSC refers alleged violations of law, rule, or regulation; gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, to SecAF, as the head of  the  agency.    The  Office  of  the  Secretary  will  forward  OSC’s  referral  letter  to  SAF/GC  for action. Section 3A -- OSC 1213(c) Referral 3.2.  Request  for  Investigation.  Upon  review  of  OSC’s  referral  letter  and  any  accompanying evidence, SAF/GCA will  make a written request  to  SAF/IG (or other appropriate organization) for  an  investigation  of  the  allegations  of  a  violation  of  any  law,  rule,  or  regulation;  gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to  public  health  or  safety  set  forth  in  OSC’s  referral  letter.    The  written  request  will,  at  a minimum,  request  an  investigation,  identify  the  allegations  referred  by  OSC  which  are  to  be investigated,  and  provide  a  suspense  date  by  which  the  report  of  investigation  (ROI)  and  all underlying evidence must be provided to SAF/GCA. 3.3.  1213  Disclosure  Investigation.  A  1213  Disclosure  Investigation  into  allegations  referred to  the  Air  Force  by  OSC  is  not  a  standard  inspector  general  investigation.    The  disclosure allegations  to  be  investigated  are  framed  by  OSC  in  its  referral  letter,  not  by  the  investigating officer (IO) through a complaint analysis process.  OSC’s allegations may be broad in scope and generally include a qualification that, where a specific allegation of wrongdoing (i.e., a violation of  law,  rule  or  regulation)  is  identified  in  the  referral  letter,  it  is  not  intended  to  be  exclusive.  Consequently,  the  OSC  referred  allegation(s)  usually  requires  a  broad  inquiry  into  the  subject matter.    For  purposes  of  investigation,  the  IO  oftentimes  paraphrases  OSC’s  allegations.    Such paraphrased  allegations  for  1213  Disclosure  Investigations  must  encompass  all  reasonably foreseeable  issues  related  to  the  initial  allegations  referred  by  OSC  and  should  be  coordinated with SAF/GCA prior to commencing the investigation.  In no case should the IO’s paraphrased allegations limit or narrow the OSC referred allegations. 3.4.  Appointment  of  Investigation  Officer.  Upon  receipt  of  SAF/GCA’s  request  for  an investigation, SAF/IG will appoint an IO. 3.4.1.  Consult  with  SAF/GCA.  Upon  appointment,  prior the  initiation  of  the investigation,  the  IO  will  consult  with  SAF/GCA  for  guidance  and  to  discuss  the  IO’s investigative plan. to 3.4.2.  Interviews.  In  cases  where  the  identity  of  the  whistleblower  is  known,  the  IO  will interview the whistleblower first (except for interviews with subject matter experts). 3.4.3.  Complaint Analysis.  Depending on the circumstances and how much information is known  at  the  start  of  the  investigation,  the  IO  may  find  it  helpful  to  conduct  a  complaint analysis.  The complaint analysis cannot limit or narrow the OSC referred allegations. 3.4.4.  Legal Review.  AF/JA, through AF/JAA (or other appropriate judge advocate office), provides  advice  to  SAF/IG  during  the  pendency  of  the  1213  Disclosure  Investigation  and AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   17  performs  a  review  of  SAF/IG’s  underlying  investigation  and  resulting  ROI  for  legal sufficiency. 3.5.  Time  is  of  the  essence.  Under  5  U.S.C.  §  1213(c),  SecAF  (or  his/her  delegatee)  must submit  the  1213  Disclosure  Report  to  OSC  within  60  days  after  the  case  is  referred  to  the Agency.  As such, time is of the essence. 3.5.1.  To  allow  sufficient  time  for  review,  revision  and  coordination,  the  disclosure investigation must be conducted within the suspense provided by SAF/GCA in its request for investigation.    If  the  IO  needs  more  time  to  conduct  a  thorough  investigation,  the  IO  must immediately notify SAF/GCA of the reasons and/or circumstances that warrant an extension of time and the length of time requested, not to exceed 60 days. 3.5.2.  With  proper  justification,  and  where  appropriate,  SAF/GCA  will  make  a  written request to OSC for an extension of time within which to submit the 1213 Disclosure Report.   [Note:  OSC  may  grant  the  Air  Force’s  request  for  an  extension  of  time;  however,  such extensions by OSC are not automatic.] 3.6.  Report  Requirements.  Under 5 U.S.C. § 1213(c), 1213 Disclosure Reports generated for submission  to  OSC  must  include  the  following  five  categories  of  information:  [Note:    The  IO must include the first four categories of information in the ROI.  With regard to the last category, the IO may include recommendations for actions based on the investigation.] 3.6.1.  A summary of the information giving rise to the investigation; 3.6.2.  A description of the conduct of the investigation; 3.6.3.  A summary of any evidence obtained from the investigation; 3.6.3.1.  Because 5 U.S.C. § 1213(c) requires a summary of the evidence, as opposed to the evidence itself, it is Air Force policy to provide a comprehensive written summary of the  facts  of  the  case  in  the  report,  rather  than  attach  the  evidence  (i.e.  transcripts  of testimony or documents) as an exhibit to the report. 3.6.3.2.  The summary of evidence assists the public in easily understanding the facts of the case and protects information gathered in the investigation that is either unnecessary to address the OSC-referred allegations or is inappropriate to release publicly. 3.6.4.  A listing of any violation or apparent violation of any law, rule, or regulation; and 3.6.5.  A description of any action taken or planned as a result of the investigation; 3.6.5.1.  Actions taken or planned as a result of the investigation may include changes in agency  rules,  regulations  or  practices;  the  restoration  of  any  aggrieved  employee; disciplinary action against any employee or military member; and referral to the Attorney General of any evidence of a criminal violation. 3.6.5.2.  This  section  of  the  1213  Disclosure  Report  is  generally  not  part  of  the underlying investigation conducted by SAF/IG.  However, where appropriate, the IO may include recommendations in the ROI for such actions based on the investigation. 3.6.5.3.  SAF/GCA  will  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal Office and management official(s) to determine what, if any, action should be taken and assist in implementing such action(s).  Such actions may include both administrative and   18  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015 disciplinary  actions.    Where  appropriate,  SAF/GCA  and/or  the  Coordinating  Air  Force Legal Office shall consult with NGB/JA. 3.6.5.4.  SAF/GCA will prepare this section of the 1213 Disclosure Report. 3.7.  Provision of ROI and Evidence to SAF/GCA.  After completion of the investigation, and in  accordance  with  SAF/GCA’s  suspense,  SAF/IG  will  deliver  a  ROI  and  all  the  evidence obtained during the investigation to SAF/GCA. 3.7.1.  SAF/GCA reserves the right to request evidence (testimony and exhibits) obtained in the investigation be provided prior to the completion of the investigation. 3.7.2.  SAF/GCA  must  review  the  SAF/IG  ROI  and  the  underlying  evidence,  and  may request further investigation. 3.7.3.  SAF/GCA  may  also  choose  to  author  a  separate  1213  Disclosure  Report  for submission to OSC, which is derivative of the SAF/IG ROI and the underlying evidence. 3.8.  Coordination.  Prior  to  submission  to  OSC,  the  final  1213  Disclosure  Report  must  be reviewed and approved by SAF/GC and signed by SecAF (or his/her delegatee). 3.8.1.  The final draft 1213 Disclosure Report for submission to OSC is only required to be staffed from SAF/GCA to SAF/GC to SecAF. 3.8.2.  At the request of SAF/GC or the direction of SecAF, the final drafted 1213 Disclosure Report may be coordinated through any other office for review and comment. 3.9.  OSC’s  Review  Process.  Under  OSC’s  review  process,  the  Air  Force  1213  Disclosure Report is shared with the whistleblower(s) who may comment on it in writing.  Thereafter, OSC may  come  back  to  the  Air  Force  for  clarification  or  with  additional  questions,  requiring additional investigation, information and/or a supplemental report. 3.9.1.  SAF/GCA will work with SAF/IG if additional investigation is needed. 3.9.2.  SAF/GCA will respond to OSC’s requests for additional information. 3.9.3.  When  appropriate,  SAF/GCA  will  prepare  and  submit  any  required  supplemental reports.    If  necessary,  SAF/GCA  will  coordinate  for  SecAF’s  signature  on  any  substantial supplemental report. 3.10.  OSC  Submission  of  Final  1213  Disclosure  Report.  OSC  is  required  by  law  to  submit the final Air Force 1213 Disclosure Report to the President and DoD’s congressional oversight committees, and to post the report along with OSC’s review and any written comments from the whistleblower(s) on the OSC’s public website, http://www.osc.gov. 3.10.1.  Until  OSC  makes  the  required  submissions  and  publication  on  its  website,  the investigation  is  still  considered  open.    Accordingly,  until  such  time,  the  1213  Disclosure Report is not considered final, may be used for official use only, and should not be released beyond those Air Force employees who have a need to know. Section 3B – OSC 1213(g) Referral 3.11.  OSC  Referral.  Under  section  1213(g),  OSC  may  refer  allegations  to  SecAF  without making a determination of substantial likelihood of a violation. AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   19  3.11.1.  Under  this  provision,  SecAF  is  required,  within  a  reasonable  time  after  OSC’s transmittal of information, to inform the Special Counsel in writing of what action has been taken or is being taken and when such action will be completed. 3.11.2.  OSC  will  provide  the  Air  Force  response  to  a  1213(g)  referral  to  the  President  and the DoD Congressional Committees, as well as post it on OSC’s public website. 3.11.3.  In certain cases, after receiving the Air Force Disclosure Report, OSC may make an official referral under 1213(c), requiring an official investigation and report of investigation. 3.11.4.  As  a  matter  of  Air  Force  policy,  upon  receipt  of  a  section  1213(g)  referral,  the procedures  set  forth  above  for  referrals  made  under  section  1213(c)  will  be  followed.  Exceptions  to  this  policy  will  be  directed  by  SAF/GCA  on  behalf  of  the  Headquarters  Air Force (HAF).  SAF/GCA, in its discretion, may determine that a limited inquiry rather than a full  investigation  would  be  appropriate.    For  example,  where  the  referred  allegations  of wrongdoing have already been investigated, in whole or in part, through another process (i.e. IG  investigation,  Commander  Directed  Investigation,  etc.),  a  limited  inquiry  may  be appropriate  to  avoid  redundant  investigative  effort.      SAF/GCA  retains  the  discretion,  in appropriate circumstances, to request a limited inquiry into the allegations, rather than a full IG investigation and will prepare a written response based upon such inquiry.

Air Force Liaison.  SAF/GCA is the Air Force liaison with OSC. 4.2.  OSC  Contact  and  Notification  Requirements.  OSC  may  contact  the  Air  Force  at  any organizational level.  Typical contacts include requests for information from OSC’s Complaints Examination Unit seeking information to determine whether to open an investigation; requests to mediate  a  complaint  from  OSC’s  ADR/mediation  unit;  and/or  a  request  for  a  POC  or  for information from an IO with OSC’s Investigation/Prosecution Unit.  In the event a representative from  OSC initiates direct  contact  with  Air Force personnel  concerning an alleged PPP, the Air Force  organization,  unit  or  civilian  employee  or  military  member  contacted  shall  immediately refer  the  OSC  representative  to  SAF/GCA.    (T-1)    After  appropriate  local  coordination  (to include their local  SJA), notice of the OSC contact  must be provided to SAF/GCA by  close of business the following day. (T-1) 4.3.  Designation of a Point of Contact.  Upon notification of an OSC contact, SAF/GCA will generally make a request to the appropriate Coordinating Air Force Legal Office, depending on the Air Force organization or unit at issue, for identification of a POC to work with OSC on the particular request for information, ADR request and/or investigation. 4.3.1.  The  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal  Office,  through  appropriate  AF/JA  channels,  will identify  a  POC  to  respond  to  OSC’s  request  for  information,  assess  OSC’s  ADR  request, and/or  administratively  assist  OSC  in  its  investigation.    Usually,  the  POC  will  be  a  judge advocate or civilian attorney assigned to the Air Force legal office for the installation where the  alleged  PPP  took  place.    Where  appropriate,  the  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal  Office shall consult with NGB/JA. 4.3.2.  The  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal  Office,  as  appropriate,  will  provide  the  POC’s name and contact information to SAF/GCA. 4.3.3.  SAF/GCA will officially designate the POC and communicate the POC designation to OSC, along with the POC’s name and contact information. 4.3.3.1.  The  POC  may  not  delegate  this  designation  to  another  attorney  without  the express, written approval of SAF/GCA. 4.3.3.2.  If  the  POC  is  scheduled  to  PCS,  go  on  extended  temporary  duty  assignment (TDY), separate from the United States Air Force, retire, or otherwise be unavailable to serve as POC, the POC must provide timely notification to SAF/GCA, through his or her judge  advocate  chain  of  command,  of  the  need  to  identify  and  designate  a  replacement POC. 4.3.4.  In certain cases arising out of the HAF (especially those involving senior officials), or for  cases  that  are  particular  sensitive  or  high  profile,  SAF/GCA  may  elect  to  serve  as  the POC to OSC. AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   21  4.4.  POC  Responsibilities.  This  instruction  defines  the  authority  of  the  POC  ,  subject  to expansion  or  reduction  by  direction  of  SAF/GC  or  SAF/GCA.    Following  POC  designation, SAF/GCA,  and/or  the  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal  Office,  as  appropriate,  will  send  an authorization letter to the POC setting forth the limits of the POC’s authority with respect to the OSC investigation.  (See Attachment 2 for a sample authorization letter).  Upon designation, the POC responsibilities include: 4.4.1.  Responding  to  OSC  requests  for  information  (including  interrogatories  and  requests for documents); 4.4.2.  Acting  as  the  official  POC  for  the  OSC  investigator  on  the  particular  matter  being investigated; 4.4.3.  Assisting  the  OSC  investigator  with  administrative  matters,  to  including  arranging witness interviews and related logistical requirements; 4.4.4.  Acting  as  a  legal  representative  for  the  command,  activity  or  installation  on  the particular OSC matter, within limitations set forth in this Instruction and his/her authorization letter; 4.4.5.  Informing  Air  Force  personnel,  as  appropriate,  of  the  nature  and  basis  of  the  OSC investigation, the authority of OSC, and the rights and duties of Air Force personnel; 4.4.6.  Advising  employees  and  military  members  suspected  or  accused  by  the  OSC  of committing a PPP or an illegal or improper act of their right to request legal representation from  the Air Force as set  forth  in  this Instruction (but see  Note at  ¶ 2.5.3.3.) and receiving and processing such requests for legal representation; 4.4.7.  Consulting  with  the  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal  Offices,  and  NGB/JA,  as appropriate, on policy and legal issues arising from the OSC investigation; 4.4.8.  Immediately contacting the Coordinating Air Force Legal Office, as appropriate, (who will notify SAF/GCA), if, during the course of an investigation, OSC files a stay of agency action.    The  appropriate  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal  Office  will  handle  the  stay  (in conjunction with the POC) before the MSPB.  (See ¶ 4.8. below.) 4.4.9.  Immediately contacting the Coordinating Air Force Legal Office, as appropriate, (who will  notify  SAF/GCA),  if  OSC  requests  ADR/mediation  or  seeks  to  initiate  settlement discussions  in  an  effort  to  resolve  the  case.    Only  SAF/GCA  is  authorized  to  engage  with OSC regarding ADR and/or settlement. This authority may be delegated by SAF/GCA to the appropriate Coordinating Air Force Legal Office or the POC.  (See ¶ 4.6. below.) 4.4.10.  Providing  regular  updates  on  the  status  of  the  assigned  OSC  investigation  to  the appropriate Coordinating Air Force Legal Office to assist in monitoring OSC investigations in the Air Force.  During the course of an investigation, status updates shall be provided at least every two weeks or sooner if a major event warrants.  (See ¶ 4.7. below.) 4.5.  Request for Information.  Upon designation, the POC will respond to OSC’s requests for information.  Requests for information may include requests for copies of Commander Directed Investigations  or  Inspector  General  ROI.    The  POC  must  coordinate  with  the  respective commander or IG office on such requests.   22  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015 4.5.1.  OSC has statutory authority to issue subpoenas as part of an official PPP investigation for  documents  held  by  an  agency.    It  is  unusual  for  OSC  to  issue  a  subpoena  for  a  typical document production request.  However, the Air Force considers an OSC document request to have the full force and effect of a subpoena, and the Air Force will provide documents in response to such an OSC request, provided the following factors are met: 4.5.1.1.  The OSC request for document production is in writing; 4.5.1.2.  The document requested is in the custody of the Air Force; 4.5.1.3.  The release of the document is not prohibited by any law, regulation, executive order, or DoD or Air Force instruction; and 4.5.1.4.  The  information  contained  in  the  document  is  not  protected  by  the  ACP  or  the attorney work-product doctrine (AWP) and is not otherwise protected from disclosure. 4.5.2.  It is the responsibility of the POC to ensure every factor is met prior to releasing any document  to  OSC,  although  the  POC  may  consult  with  the  appropriate  Coordinating  Air Force Legal Office as needed. 4.5.3.  Documents  that  are  protected  by  the  AWP  and/or  the  ACP  must  be  withheld  from disclosure  to  OSC  by  the  POC.    In  the  event  only  part  of  a  document  is  protected  from release to OSC, the protected information must be redacted with a clear marking by the POC of the redacted information.  For example, if  a sentence in  an email is  privileged, the POC should white-out that sentence, then draw a line through the whited-out portion and mark it “REDACTED – ACP” or with similar language; then copy the page to ensure the redaction cannot be read from the reverse side.  The POC must also keep a log of all redactions, as well as unredacted versions of all documents. 4.5.4.  SAF/GC is the approval authority for waiver of the ACP and for the release of AWP.  Any  request  for such waiver/release  will be routed through AF/JA and SAF/GCA,  and any approval of such waiver/release will be made in writing by SAF/GC or SAF/GC’s designee, SAF/GCA. 4.5.5.  Any  OSC  request  for  classified  information  shall  be  processed  under  all  applicable laws and regulations governing the handling and disclosure of classified information.  (T-0) SAF/GCA must be notified that an OSC request covers classified information. (T-1) 4.5.6.  Only SAF/GCA is authorized to release Air Force documents to OSC.  However, this authority  is  routinely  delegated  to  the  designated  POC  and  to  the  appropriate  Coordinating Air Force Legal Office.    [Note:  But see ¶ 4.11.1. regarding employees or applicants filing complaints]. 4.6.  Request  for  ADR/Mediation  or  Initiation  of  Settlement  Discussions.  In  an  effort  to resolve the case, OSC may request ADR or initiate settlement discussions with the POC.  If OSC requests to engage in ADR or initiates settlement discussions, the POC must contact SAF/GCA immediately, through appropriate channels.  (T-1) Absent affirmative delegation, only SAF/GCA is authorized to engage with OSC regarding ADR and/or settlement.  This authority will often be delegated by SAF/GCA to the Coordinating Air Force Legal Office (as appropriate) or the POC.  When  such  authority  is  delegated,  the  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal  Office  or  the  POC  will provide SAF/GCA with the draft settlement agreement for review.  Upon SAF/GCA’s approval, the settlement agreement may be finalized. AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   23  4.7.  Monitoring  of  PPP  Investigations.  The  POC  is  required  to  keep  the  Coordinating  Air Force  Legal  Office  (as  appropriate)  apprised  of  the  status  of  any  OSC  investigations.  (T-1) During  the  course  of  the  OSC  investigation,  the  POC  shall  provide  updates  at  least  every  two weeks  or  when  a  major  event  warrants.    The  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal  Office  (as appropriate)  will  monitor  each  OSC  PPP  investigation  under  their  jurisdiction  and  update SAF/GCA  on  the  status  of  all  OSC  investigations  on  a  monthly  basis  or  when  a  major  event warrants.    SAF/GCA,  in  turn,  will  keep  the  SAF/GC  informed  of  the  status  of  OSC investigations in the Air Force. 4.8.  Petitions for Stays of a Personnel Action Filed by OSC.  The OSC may request that the MSPB stay a personnel  action pursuant  to  5 U.S.C. § 1214.  When the OSC serves an activity with a petition for stay, the POC, if designated, or the SJA, if no POC has been designated, must immediately notify the appropriate Coordinating Air Force Legal Office.  See Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), Administrative Personnel, Part 1201, Practices and Procedures, Subpart D, Procedures for Original Jurisdiction Cases for further information. 4.8.1.  When  the  Air  Force  voluntarily  agrees  to  a  stay  of  a  personnel  action  or  where  the MSPB grants a stay at the request of the OSC, the POC must provide weekly status updates to  the  appropriate  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal  Office,  which  addresses  any  development concerning the employee(s) affected by the stay, including “no change” reports.  This weekly written  report  shall  be  e-mailed  by  close  of  business  each  Friday  during  the  period  of  the stay. (T-1) 4.9.  Funding.  The  command,  activity,  or  installation  within  which  the  alleged  PPP  arose  will provide funding for travel, per diem, and other expenses related to the OSC investigation.  These expenses may include appropriate funding for witnesses and other administrative support.  (T-1) [NOTE:  When an ANG witness is required by OSC, it may be necessary to provide a Title 10 line of accounting to ensure the witness is in an appropriate military duty status.] Section 4B—Civilian Employee and Military Member Cooperation 4.10.  Requirement  to  Cooperate.  All  Air  Force  civilian  employees  and  military  members must cooperate in all OSC investigations, subject to the proper exercise of rights pursuant to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution; Article 31 of the UMCJ, as applicable; and any other law, regulation, Executive Order, DoD or Air Force Instruction, privilege, or doctrine that prohibits or otherwise protects certain information from being released.  Subject to these limitations, civilian employees and military members are required to answer all questions truthfully and completely and  request  clarification  of  anything  that  the  civilian  employee  or  military  member  does  not clearly understand. 4.11.  Document Production.  Documents will be provided to OSC only by the designated POC, the  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal  Office,  when  authorized,  or  SAF/GCA,  and  only  after  the appropriate  review  required  in  Section  4A.    The  POC  may  contact  civilian  employees  and military  members  to  assist  in  document  production  and  answering  interrogatories.    All  civilian employees and military members must cooperate with requests of the POC subject to ¶ 4.10.  In response to a direct request for information from OSC, a civilian employee or military member is not permitted to provide Air Force or other government documents directly to OSC.   24  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015 The civilian employee or military member contacted shall immediately refer the OSC representative to the designated POC (if there is one) or to SAF/GCA.  (T-1)  After appropriate local coordination (to include their local SJA), notice of the OSC request for information must also be provided to SAF/GCA.   4.11.1.  This  Instruction  does  not  prohibit  Air  Force  employees  (civilian  or  military  and/or applicants  for  employment)  from  filing  complaints  with  OSC  and/or  from  providing supporting documentation with their complaint, as long as the release of such documentation is not prohibited by any law, regulation, executive order, DoD or Air Force Instruction. 4.12.  Official  Business.  Civilian  employee  and  military  member  participation  in  OSC investigations,  MSPB  hearings,  and  other  related  proceedings  is  considered  official  business  if the  civilian  employee  or  military  member  is  otherwise  in  duty  status.    Participation  in  an  OSC investigation  should  be  coordinated  with  the  civilian  employee’s  or  military  member’s supervisor.    [Note:    When  the  presence  of  a  reserve  military  member  not  currently  in  military duty status is required or desired, contact the legal office at Air Force Reserve Command or the member’s  servicing  JA  representative  for  assistance.    Similarly,  contact  NGB/JA  if  Title  32 personnel (military or technician) are involved.] 4.13.  Witness  Testimony/Reprisal.  No Air Force  civilian employee or military member shall influence  witness  testimony  or  create  the  appearance  of  influencing  witness  testimony.    (T-0) Further,  civilian  employees  and  military  members  are  protected  by  law  from  reprisal  for cooperating in an OSC investigation. 4.13.1.  If  a  civilian  employee  or  military  member  believes  they  are  subject  to  retaliation because  of  their  participation  in  an  OSC  investigation,  they  may  contact  an  appropriate official within or outside the Air Force.  If the civilian employee or military member elects to report the retaliation within the Air Force, they may contact the designated POC or the local IG’s office.  The civilian employee or military member is free, however, to contact officials within their chain of command, the SJA, or any other official he/she deems appropriate. 4.14.  Recording Testimony.  A civilian employee or military member may personally create an audio recording of a meeting with OSC if the recording device is in plain view, all attendees at the  interview  have  knowledge  that  the  meeting  may  be  recorded,  and  the  OSC  investigator agrees to allow the recording to take place. 4.15.  OSC  Recording  Testimony.  An  OSC  investigator  may  create  an  audio  recording  of  an interview  with  an  employee  or  military  member  if  the  OSC  investigator  notifies  the  civilian employee or military member that an audio recording is being made and the recording device is in plain view. 4.16.  Affidavits.  A civilian employee or military member is not required to sign an affidavit or written summary of their testimony, but may do so subject to the following: 4.16.1.  A civilian employee or military member may edit the document to correct errors with an ink pen, and must initial the edits. 4.16.2.  A  civilian  employee  or  military  member  may  request  a  copy  of  the  affidavit  or written summary as a condition of signing. Section 4C—Legal Representation during a PPP Investigation AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   25  4.17.  Witnesses.  Civilian  employees  and  military  members  asked  to  provide  testimony  or documents or otherwise participate in an OSC investigation, whom OSC has not identified as a suspect  or  who  do  not  reasonably  believe  the  OSC  suspects  or  accuses  them  of  improper  or illegal  conduct  (i.e.  a  witness),  do  not  qualify  for  Air  Force-provided  personal  legal representation  under  this  Instruction.    Such  witnesses  may,  however,  receive  legal  advice  from Air  Force  attorneys  regarding  the  investigation,  including  legal  advice  on  their  rights  and obligations.    However,  no  attorney-client  relationship  will  attach  as  a  result  of  rendering  such advice  (but  see  Note  at  ¶  2.5.3.3.).    The  attorney-client  relationship  shall  not  be  established unless the civilian employee or military member is suspected or accused by OSC of committing a PPP or other illegal  or improper act,  the civilian employee or military  member has requested legal representation in writing, SAF/GC has approved such request, and the employee or military member has been assigned Air Force or DoD counsel. 4.18.  Approval  Authority.  In  accordance  with  DoDD  5500.19,  SAF/GC  may  approve  the assignment of Air Force legal counsel, upon request, to represent the personal interests of an Air Force employee or military member suspected or accused by the OSC of committing a PPP or an illegal or improper act, provided: 4.18.1.  The alleged PPP or other illegal or improper act complained of was done within the scope of the employee’s official responsibilities; and 4.18.2.  The assignment of agency counsel to the employee or military member is in the best interest of the Air Force. 4.19.  Procedures.  The  following  procedures  will  apply  when  a  civilian  employee  or  military member  requests  an  Air  Force  attorney  be  appointed  to  represent  his  or  her  personal  interests during an OSC investigation: 4.19.1.  The  civilian  employee  or  military  member  must  submit  a  written  request  for  legal representation to the designated Air Force POC.  (T-0) The written request must state that the employee  is  requesting  an  Air  Force  attorney  be  appointed  to  represent  his  or  her  personal interests; indicate whether, in  connection with an OSC investigation, he or she has retained legal  counsel  from  outside  the  Air  Force;  and  explain  the  circumstances  that  justify  the requested  Air  Force  counsel.    In  addition,  the  civilian  employee  or  military  member  must attach  all  documents  served  on  that  civilian  employee  or  military  member  by  OSC,  and attach any other relevant evidence supporting the request.  (See Attachment 3 for a sample.) 4.19.2.  The  burden  is  on  the  requester  to  supply  sufficient  facts  to  establish  that  the appointment of an Air Force attorney would be in the Air Force’s best interest. 4.19.3.  In  addition,  the  civilian  employee  or  military  member  must  obtain  a  written certification  from  his  or  her  supervisor  that  the  civilian  employee  or  military  member  was acting  within  the  scope  of  his  or  her  official  duties  and  that  no  adverse  or  disciplinary personnel  action  has  been  initiated  or  taken  by  the  Air  Force  against  the  employee  for  the conduct being investigated by the OSC.  (T-0) 4.19.4.  The  POC  shall  immediately  notify  the  appropriate  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal Office as well as SAF/GCA when a request is initiated.  (T-1) The POC shall also coordinate with OSC to ensure that any interviews are scheduled to allow sufficient time for the civilian employee or military member to obtain legal representation. (T-0)   26  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015 4.19.5.  Once  a  request  for  government  legal  representation  has  been  initiated,  if  the employee  or  member  chooses  to  obtain  private  counsel,  in  connection  with  an  OSC investigation, the employee or member shall immediately notify the POC. (T-1) 4.19.6.  The  POC,  with  the  coordination  of  the  servicing  SJA,  must  write  a  litigation report/opinion  that  details  the  known  relevant  facts  under  investigation,  including  the requesting  employee’s  relationship  to  the  complainant  and  involvement  in  the  allegations under  investigation,  with  a  recommendation  as  to  whether  or  not  providing  an  Air  Force counsel would be appropriate.  (T-1) 4.19.7.  Except  as  set  forth  below,  the  servicing  SJA  will  route  the  request  package  along with the POC’s written litigation report/opinion through JA channels to the MAJCOM.  (T-1) The  MAJCOM  will  forward  the  entire  request  package  to  AFLOA/JACL-LLFSC, AFMC/JA,  and/or  AFRC/JA,  as  appropriate,  who  will  provide  a  written  evaluation  of  the request  and  forward  the  package  to  AF/JA  for  coordination.    AF/JA  will  then  forward  the package  to  SAF/GCA,  who  will  provide  a  recommendation  and  forward  the  request  to SAF/GC for final decision. 4.20.  Approval  Authority.  SAF/GC  is  the  approval  and  denial  authority  for  Air  Force  legal counsel  requests  made  under  this  section.    Upon  approval,  SAF/GCA  will  provide  the  civilian employee  or  military  member  with  a  written  explanation  of  the  terms  of  legal  representation. (See  Attachment  5  for  a  sample).    The  civilian  employee  or  military  member  must  accept  the conditions of legal representation in writing.  (T-0) 4.21.  Duration of Representation.  If the request for Air Force legal counsel is approved under this  Instruction,  the  representation  will  only  extend  to  the  OSC  investigation.    Air  Force resources cannot be used to provide legal representation for a civilian employee for disciplinary action initiated against the employee for committing or participating in a PPP or for engaging in other illegal or improper conduct, regardless of whether that participation or conduct is also the basis for the disciplinary action proposed by OSC. 4.22.  Appointment  of  Counsel/Conflict  of  Interest.  Upon  approval  of  a  request  for  legal representation  and  the  acceptance  of  the  conditions  of  legal  representation  by  the  employee  or military  member,  SAF/GC  will  notify  and  coordinate  with  AF/JA  who  will  identify  and  detail agency counsel.  Appointment of counsel should be made after notification and consultation with that  attorney’s  commander  or  MAJCOM  (or  equivalent  (SJA)).    If  legal  representation  is approved  for  Title  32  personnel,  AF/JA  shall  consult  with  NGB/JA  prior  to  appointment  and detail of agency counsel. 4.22.1.  Prior to appointment, AF/JA, in consultation with SAF/GC, shall determine whether an Air Force attorney under consideration to represent the employee or member is likely to have  a  conflict  of  interest.    Any  Air  Force  attorney  considered  for  appointment  under  this section  to  represent  the  personal  interests  of  an  Air  Force  employee  or  military  member  is disqualified  from  such  consideration  if  the  attorney  has  a  conflict  of  interest  in  the  matter.  Where appropriate, AF/JA shall also consult with NGB/JA. 4.22.2.  In the event no Air Force attorney qualifies for consideration because of conflicts of interest,  the  SAF/GC  or  AF/JA  on  behalf  of  SAF/GC,  may  contact  other  Military Departments  to  identify  legal  counsel.    Upon  identification  and  appointment  by  the  other AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   27  Military  Department,  that  attorney  shall  be  made  available  to  the  employee  or  member requesting representation. (T-1) 4.22.3.  In  the  event  no  attorney  within  the  DoD  is  qualified  for  consideration  and/or available,  the  request  for  representation  made  by  the  employee  or  military  member  will normally be denied. 4.23.  Private  Counsel.  The  Air  Force  will  not  provide,  retain  or  fund  private  outside  legal counsel  on  behalf  of  a  civilian  employee  or  military  member  or  provide  funds  to  a  civilian employee  or  military  member  for  the  purpose  of  retaining  outside  counsel,  except  in  unusual circumstances as determined by and subject to, the personal approval of DoD/GC. 4.24.  Letters  of  Appointment.  All  letters  of  appointment  must  clearly  explain  the  scope  and limits  of  the  legal  representation  (which  should  mirror  the  conditions  set  forth  in  the  SAF/GC approval letter).  (See Attachment 4 for a sample).  When appointed to such a duty, an Air Force attorney’s client in the matter is the civilian employee or military member, and the attorney shall diligently represent that assigned client in matters related to the OSC investigation.  (T-0)  The attorney’s  professional  responsibility  to  DoD  and  the  Air  Force  is  satisfied  by  fulfilling  this responsibility to the civilian employee or military member. 4.25.  Termination of Legal Representation.  SAF/GC is the approval and denial authority for all requests to terminate legal representation under this section. 4.25.1.  An Air Force attorney may request to terminate the legal representation or withdraw from  representing  the  civilian  employee  or  military  member,  by  sending  a  request  for termination or withdrawal to SAF/GC. 4.25.2.  Requests will be justified by the attorney to the extent they do not conflict with the attorney’s rules of professional responsibility. 4.25.3.  An  Air  Force  attorney  may  request  to  withdraw  from  representing  the  civilian employee or military member, subject to SAF/GC approval, and without explanation, where the  justification  for  the  withdrawal  request  provides  that  further  explanation  would compromise the ACP. 4.25.4.  The attorney client relationship may be terminated if the assigned Air Force attorney for the civilian employee or military member determines, with the approval of SAF/GC, that: 4.25.4.1.  The civilian employee or military member was acting outside the scope of his or  her  official  duties  when  engaging  in  the  conduct  that  is  the  basis  for  the  OSC investigation or charge; and 4.25.4.2.  Termination of the professional representation is not in violation of the rules of professional conduct applicable to the assigned counsel. 4.26.  Area Defense Counsel.  Military members may request legal counsel from their servicing Area Defense Counsel (ADC) office.  Military members being disciplined for misconduct arising from  improper  or  illegal  conduct,  or  a  PPP,  are  entitled  to  military  defense  counsel  under  the UCMJ.    The  procedures  for  whether  a  military  defense  counsel  will  be  assigned  to  represent  a military member are set by AFLOA/JAJD. (See Note, ¶ 2.5.3.3.) 4.27.  Private Counsel.  Military members and civilian employees are always permitted to retain civilian counsel at their own expense.  Neither the Air Force nor DoD will reimburse any costs to   28  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015 a  civilian  employee  or  military  member  who  retains  private  counsel  unless  the  employee  or military  member  obtains  advance  authorization  from  SAF/GC  and  DoD/GC  for  such representation. Section 4D—Corrective Action 4.28.  Remedies.  If it is determined that a PPP took place, corrective action may result.  As set out in 5 U.S.C. § 1214(g), corrective action may include remedies taken to place the individual, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the PPP not occurred (often referred to as returned to “status quo ante”); reimbursement for attorneys’ fees; back pay and  related  benefits;  medical  costs  incurred,  travel  expenses,  any  reasonable  and  foreseeable consequential  damages  and  compensatory  damages  (including  interest,  reasonable  expert  fees, and costs).  [Note:  The WPEA was signed into law on November 27, 2012, with  an effective date  of  December  27,  2012.  The  MSPB  has  held  that  the  WPEA  provision  providing  for compensatory damages does not apply retroactively to cases that were pending on the effective date of the WPEA.] 4.29.  Settlement.  Upon finding a PPP took place, and sometimes prior to the completion of an investigation,  OSC  may  attempt  to  broker  a  settlement  between  the  Air  Force  and  the  affected employee to satisfactorily return the employee to status quo ante and negate the need to litigate corrective  action.    In  doing  so,  OSC  acts  as  the  intermediary  between  the  Air  Force  and  the affected employee during settlement discussions.  Generally, OSC drafts and approves settlement agreements. 4.30.  Authority  to  Settle.  SAF/GCA  has  the  sole  authority,  absent  delegation,  to  conduct settlement negotiations with OSC, in consultation with the Coordinating Air Force Legal Office and the designated POC (as appropriate) and with the assistance of any other necessary Air Force employee.    SAF/GCA  also  has  the  discretion  to  delegate  the  authority  to  conduct  settlement negotiations with OSC in a particular case to the POC or another Air Force attorney. 4.31.  Settlement and Air Force Responsibility for PPPs.  While OSC may sometimes attempt to settle a case for corrective action prior to the completion of their investigation (either directly or  through  ADR/mediation),  it  may  not  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the  Air  Force  to  do  so, especially if OSC declines to provide underlying information relating to the PPP allegation.  It is usually in the best interests of the Air Force to fully investigate claims of PPPs so that decisions on whether or not to grant corrective action, as well as whether or not to take disciplinary action, are based on full knowledge of the facts.  The Air Force has a responsibility to identify PPPs and to correct them.  Settling a corrective action case simply for expediency  or “nuisance value” is generally inappropriate. 4.32.  Corrective  Action  during  Investigation.  Where it is determined by a preponderance of evidence that a PPP took place, it is Air Force policy to enter into a settlement agreement with the employee to take appropriate corrective action to return the employee harmed to  status quo ante.  When the Air Force determines that a PPP likely took place, there may be circumstances during the pendency of an OSC investigation where it may be prudent for the Air Force to take certain  corrective  action.    Generally,  the  corrective  action  contemplated  in  such  circumstances would be to forego further personnel actions related to the employee.  For example, if it appears that  a  proposal  for  removal  was  tainted  with  retaliatory  motive,  it  may  be  prudent  to  simply withdraw  the  proposal.  Where  deemed  appropriate,  the  Air  Force  may  take  such  corrective AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   29  action without a settlement agreement.   In no case, however, should management officials take corrective action related to an OSC investigation without consultation with SAF/GCA. 4.33.  Review of Settlement Agreements.  Regardless of which Air Force attorney conducts the settlement negotiations, SAF/GCA will review all written settlement agreements related to OSC investigations  prior  to  execution.    SAF/GCA  will  consult  with  the  servicing  legal  office  on whether the settlement agreement is in the best interests of the Air Force.  While the appropriate management  official  maintains  the  authority  to  approve  or  disapprove  a  settlement  agreement, that authority may be withheld by a more senior management official in any case depending on the best interests of the Air Force. 4.34.  OSC Prosecution.  In the event a settlement cannot be reached and management officials decline to take corrective action, OSC has the statutory authority to file the case with the MSPB to request an order for corrective action.  OSC may also choose not to file, in which case OSC will issue the employee an individual right of action (IRA) to file with the MSPB.  In the event a corrective  action  case  is  filed  with  the  MSPB,  the  Coordinating  Air  Force  Legal  Office,  as appropriate, is responsible for representing the Air Force in the proceeding. 4.35.  Funding.  Funding  for  corrective  actions,  whether  through  settlement  or  ordered  by MSPB,  will  be  provided  from  the  command,  activity,  or  installation  from  which  the  PPP allegations arose.  (T-1) Section 4E—Disciplinary Action 4.36.  Special  Counsel  Approval.  By  statute,  5  U.S.C.  §  1214(f),  the  Air  Force  is  prohibited from  taking  disciplinary  action  against  an  employee  for  any  alleged  PPP  (or  for  any  related activity) that is under investigation by OSC, unless the Special Counsel approves. 4.37.  OSC  Prosecution  of  Disciplinary  Action.  OSC is charged, by statute, with prosecuting the appropriate disciplinary action against the employee at the MSPB upon finding that a civilian employee  committed  a  PPP,  violated  the  provisions  of  any  law,  rule  or  regulation,  engaged  in any other conduct within the jurisdiction of the Special Counsel as described in 5 U.S.C. § 1216, or knowingly and willfully refused or failed to comply with an order of the MSPB. 4.38.  OSC  Request  for  Agency  Action.  OSC  may  request  that  the  Air  Force  take  the appropriate  disciplinary  action.    Upon  such  a  request,  SAF/GCA,  the  Coordinating  Air  Force Legal  Office  and  the  appropriate  servicing  legal  office,  will  advise  on  the  appointment  of appropriate proposing and deciding officials, and discipline will be considered per standard Air Force policy, federal employment law and regulations.  Prior to the imposition of any discipline, SAF/GCA will consult with OSC on the matter to gain OSC’s approval.  In the event OSC does not approve of the proffered disciplinary action, the Air Force will close the matter internally so that  OSC  can  move  forward  with  their  own  prosecution.    Disciplinary  action  may  not  be proposed  against  a  civilian  employee  for  an  alleged  PPP  under  investigation  by  OSC,  without OSC’s written approval. 4.39.  Evidence.  To  consider  appropriate  discipline,  generally  it  is  necessary  to  obtain  OSC’s evidence  file  from  their  investigation.    SAF/GCA  is  responsible  for  coordinating  with  OSC  to obtain all necessary evidence.  If OSC refuses to provide the necessary evidence, the Air Force may  decline  to  prosecute  disciplinary  action  or  may  undertake  a  separate  investigation  to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to support disciplinary action.   30  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015 4.40.  Discipline  for  Military  Members.  Upon  finding  that  a  military  member  engaged  in  a PPP, OSC may recommend disciplinary or other appropriate action to SecAF in conjunction with providing  the  evidence  on  which  such  recommendation  is  made.    Upon  the  referral  of  such  a recommendation,  the  matter  will  be  delegated  to  the  lowest  appropriate  authority  for consideration.    OSC  has  no  authority  to  take  disciplinary  action  against  a  military  member.  However,  SecAF  is  required  to  report  to  OSC  on  actions  taken  or  proposed  against  a  military member if OSC refers such a case after a PPP investigation. 4.41.  Disciplinary  Action  After  OSC  Case  Closed.  If  OSC  closes  its  investigation  without taking any disciplinary action, and the Air Force determines that a PPP or other misconduct has taken  place,  the  Air  Force  may  determine  responsibility  for  such  misconduct  and  consider appropriate disciplinary action against those responsible. AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   31  Chapter 5 OSC CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS INTO OTHER ALLEGED PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES (USERRA AND HATCH ACT VIOLATIONS) 5.1.  Procedure.  Upon OSC notice to the Air Force of OSC complaints containing allegations of violation(s)  of  the  Hatch  Act  or  USERRA,  the  basic  procedure  set  forth  in  Chapter  4  for  PPP investigations will be used. 5.2.  Designation  of  POC.  A  POC  will  be  designated  and  he  or  she  will  have  the  same substantive duties as a POC in a PPP investigation.  (See ¶s 4.3. and 4.4. above.) 5.3.  Duty  to  Cooperate.  Civilian  employees  and  military  members  have  the  same  duty  to cooperate with OSC and the POC in these investigations, subject to the same limitations set forth in Chapter 4.  (See section 4B above.) 5.4.  Legal  Representation.  Requests for legal representation will be handled according to the same procedure as set forth in Section 4C. 5.5.  ADR  and  Settlement.  The roles, responsibilities and procedures for ADR and settlement authority for these investigations will follow the same guidelines as set forth in Chapter 4.  (See ¶ 4.6. above.) 5.6.  Notification of OSC Contact and Monitoring.  The guidance on notification requirements for  OSC  contacts  and  for  monitoring  of  Hatch  Act  and  USERRA  investigations  conducted  by OSC is the same as set forth in Chapter 4.  (See ¶s 4.2. and 4.7. above.) 5.7.  Funding.  The  command,  activity,  or  installation  within  which  the  alleged  Hatch  Act  or USERRA violation arose will provide funding for travel, per diem, and other expenses related to the OSC investigation.  These expenses may include appropriate funding for witnesses and other administrative support. (T-1) 5.8.  Corrective  Action  –  USERRA:  The  specific  relief  granted  for  a  particular  USERRA violation will depend on what needs to be remedied (for example, restoration of leave that was denied,  reemployment  in  the  position  that  was  previously  held,  compensation  for  any  loss  of wages or benefits, or promotion due to the escalator principle).  However, the core principle is to put  the appellant  where  he or she would have been if not  for the violation.   In  addition,  where appropriate, such individuals may also receive reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and other litigation expenses. 5.9.  Disciplinary Action – USERRA:  As warranted, disciplinary actions based on a USERRA investigation may be taken against civilian employees and military members found responsible for USERRA violations. 5.10.  Disciplinary  Action  –  Hatch  Act:  The Hatch Act Modernization Act of 2012, effective January  27,  2013,  modified  the  penalty  structure  for  violations  of  the  Hatch  Act  by  federal employees.  Under  the  modified  penalty  structure,  an  employee  who  violates  the  Hatch  Act  is subject  to  a  range  of  disciplinary  actions,  including  removal  from  federal  service,  reduction  in grade,  debarment  from  federal  employment  for  a  period  not  to  exceed  5  years,  suspension, reprimand, or a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000. (Before enactment of these amendments, an employee  was  subject  to  removal,  or  in  some  cases,  a  suspension  of  no  less  than  30  days  for   32  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015 Hatch Act violations). The modified penalty structure applies to violations that occurred before, on, or after January 27, 2013, unless OSC has already initiated a complaint with the MSPB as of that date, or an employee has already entered into a settlement agreement with OSC.  OSC has exclusive  jurisdiction  to  investigate  and  prosecute  complaints  alleging  a  violation  of  the  Hatch Act. [Remainder of Page Intentionally Blank]  Gordon O.

The definition of abuse of authority does not contain a de minimis standard or threshold. Corrective Action for a PPP may include—    That the individual be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the PPP not occurred;    Reimbursement for attorney’s fees, back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages, and compensatory damages (including interest, reasonable expert fees, and costs); and   36  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   Any corrective action may include fees, costs, or damages reasonably incurred due to an agency investigation.   Covered Position. To qualify under civilian reprisal law, the complainant must be in a “covered position.”  A “covered position” means any civilian position in the competitive service, a career appointee position in the Senior Executive Service, or a position in the excepted service.  It does not include any position which is, prior to the personnel action, 1) excepted from the competitive service because of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character; 2) excluded from the coverage of this section by the President based on a determination by the President that it is necessary and warranted by conditions of good administration; 3) a contract position; or 4) a uniformed military personnel position.    Gross Mismanagement means a management action or inaction which creates a substantial risk of significant adverse impact upon the agency’s ability to accomplish its mission.  It does not include management decisions which are merely debatable, nor does it mean action or inaction which constitutes simple negligence or wrongdoing.    Gross Waste of Funds means a more than debatable expenditure that is significantly out of proportion to the benefit reasonably expected to accrue to the government.    Personnel Action.  As used IAW 5 U.S.C. § 2302(a)(2)(A), a “personnel action” with respect to an employee in or applicant for a covered position within the Air Force means any actual adverse or unfavorable personnel action taken or threatened or any positive personnel action withheld (failed to take), to include the following:   An appointment   By way of example, a failure to take an action may include cancellation of a vacancy announcement.     A promotion   An action under chapter 75 of Title 5 or other disciplinary or corrective action   Applies to more than just actions in an employee’s official personnel file such as suspensions or removals.    By way of example, it also applies to a letter of admonishment or suspension of law enforcement authority.   A detail, transfer, or reassignment   A reinstatement   A restoration   A reemployment   A performance evaluation under chapter 43 of Title 5   A threatened action may include placing an employee on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) if all other elements of civilian reprisal are present.   A decision concerning pay, benefits, or awards, or concerning education or training if the education or training may reasonably be expected to lead to an appointment, promotion, performance evaluation, or other action described in this subparagraph    By way of illustration, this includes but is not limited to:   Placement of an employee in a leave without pay or absent without leave status; AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   37    Denial of annual leave; and   Denial of an opportunity to earn overtime pay that an employee would otherwise have been provided.   A decision to order psychiatric testing or examination    Any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions   Under this item, case law has included a variety of management actions that may be considered changes in duties or working conditions, including but not limited to retaliatory investigations, reorganizations, deliberate idling, cessation of communications with the employee by the manager, development of an occupational disease because of working conditions, and denial of courteous treatment (i.e. being subject to yelling, profanity, embarrassment).    Under Federal Circuit case law, a revocation of a security clearance is not considered a personnel action; however DoD/IG may take these types of civilian reprisal cases.  Prohibited Personnel Practice.  An action taken by an employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, when such action is prohibited by 5 U.S.C. §§ 2302(b)(1) - 2302(b)(13).  Such employee shall not, with respect to his or her authority: 1)  Discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicapping condition, marital status, or political affiliation, as prohibited by certain specified laws in 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(1); 2)  Solicit or consider any recommendation or statement, oral or written, with respect to any individual who requests, or is under consideration for, any personnel action, unless the recommendation or statement is based on the personal knowledge or records of the person furnishing it, and consists of an evaluation of the work performance, ability, aptitude, or general qualifications of the individual, or an evaluation of the character, loyalty, or suitability of such individual (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(2); 3)  Coerce the political activity of any person (including the providing of any political contribution or service), or take any action against any employee or applicant for  employment as a reprisal for the refusal of any person to engage in such political activity (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(3)); 4)  Deceive or willfully obstruct any person with respect to such person's right to compete for employment (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(4)); 5)  Influence any person to withdraw from competition for any position for the purpose of  improving or injuring the prospects of any other person for employment (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(5)); 6)  Grant any preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation to any employee or applicant for employment (including defining the scope or manner of competition or the requirements for any position) for the purpose of improving or injuring the prospects of any particular person for employment (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(6)); 7)  Appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment,  promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position any individual who is a relative as  defined in 5 U.S.C. § 3110 of the employee if the position is in the Agency in which the  employee is serving as a public official (as defined in reference (h)) or over which the  employee exercises jurisdiction or control as an official (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(7));    38  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015 8)  Take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to  any employee or applicant for employment because of whistleblower disclosures.  (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8)); 9)  Take or fail to take a personnel action against an employee or applicant for employment  as a reprisal for the exercise of any appeal, complaint or grievance right granted by law, rule, or regulation or testify for or otherwise lawfully assist any individual in the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance, right granted by any law, rule, regulation; cooperating with or disclosing any information to the Inspector General of any Agency,  or the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law; or for refusing to  obey an order that would require an individual to violate a law (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(9)); 10) Discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of conduct that does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(10)); 11) Knowingly take, recommend, or approve any personnel action if the taking of such action  would violate a veteran's performance requirement; or fail to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action if the failure to take such action would violate a veteran’s performance requirement (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(11));  12) Take or fail to take any other personnel action if the taking, or failure to take, such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in 5 U.S.C. § 2301 (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(12)); or 13) Implement or enforce any nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement, if such policy, form, or agreement does not contain the following statement: “These provisions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by existing statute or Executive Order relating to (1) classified information, (2) communications to Congress, (3) the reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or (4) any other whistleblower protection. The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by controlling Executive Orders and statutory provisions are incorporated into this agreement and are controlling.”  (T-0 (for all))   Protected Disclosure.   A protected disclosure is any formal or information communication or transmission of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences one or more of the following: 1.  Any violation of any law, rule or regulation; 2.  Gross mismanagement; 3.  Gross waste of funds; 4.  Abuse of authority; or 5.  Substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.  if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law and if such information is not specifically required by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.  Disclosures that are prohibited by law or required to be kept secret are protected if they are made to the Special Counsel or to an agency’s IG.   The term “protected disclosure” does not include a communication concerning policy AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   39  decisions that lawfully exercise discretionary authority, unless the employee or applicant providing the disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evidences a violation of law, rule or regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.   A disclosure shall not be excluded because—   Of the employee’s or applicant’s motive for making the disclosure;    Of the amount of time which has passed since the occurrence of events described; or   The disclosure    was made to a supervisor;    was made in the normal course of duties;    was made to a person who participated in the disclosed wrongdoing;    was not made in writing; or   was made while the employee was off duty.  revealed information that had been previously disclosed;  Substantial or Specific Danger to Public Health or Safety.  For civilian reprisal, a disclosure of a “danger to public health or safety” must be substantial and specific.  A variety of factors may determine when a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific.  Two of these are (1) the likelihood of harm resulting from the danger and (2) when the alleged harm may occur.  If the disclosed danger could only result in harm under speculative or improbable conditions, or is not likely to occur in the immediate or near future but rather manifest only in the distant future, it would not qualify.  The nature of the harm, that is the potential consequences, affects the substantiality of the danger.  Whistleblower. A present or former Federal employee or applicant for Federal employment who makes a protected disclosure of information he or she reasonably believes evidences:   A violation of any law, rule, or regulation;   Gross mismanagement;    A gross waste of funds;    An abuse of authority; or   A substantial or specific danger to public health or safety,  if such disclosures are not specifically prohibited by law and if such information is not specifically required by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs (5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8)(A)).    40  AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015 Attachment 2 SAMPLE POC AUTHORIZATION LETTER (Date)  MEMORANDUM FOR ____________ (Air Force Attorney)  FROM:  SAF/GCA  Subject:  Designation of Office of Special Counsel Point of Contact  You [have been] [are hereby] designated as the point of contact (POC) for the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) in their investigation [case citation if known] into allegation(s) of prohibited personnel practices against (employee) by (management official).  While we are not privy to the complaint made or other details of the case, we have been told by OSC that the matter involves ___________.  You are instructed to review AFI 51-1102 in its entirety.  You may also find it helpful to review DoDD 5500.19.  Your role as POC is to act as the official contact with the OSC investigator on this particular matter being investigated.  In this case, the OSC investigator is (name) and he/she can be contacted at (telephone) or by email at (email address).  Please establish contact with him/her as soon as practical.  According to OCS, POCs should expect an explanation of (in general terms) the allegation(s) under investigation but often OSC will not reveal the name of the complainant.    In conducting their investigation, the OSC investigator will require your assistance.  Generally, OSC will ask you to produce documents, answer interrogatories, and arrange for witness interviews.  You are responsible for coordinating on all these requests.  As it is unlikely that you can personally find and produce all requested documents and/or answer all interrogatories, you have the authority to retrieve documents and information from any Air Force employee in order to respond completely to OSC’s requests.  In turning over documents or interrogatory answers to OSC, you should be mindful that it is your responsibility to review every aspect of what is turned over.  As the gatekeeper, you must ensure that the information released to OSC is not only accurate and complete, but also free of classified, privileged, or otherwise protected information.   See AFI 51-1102 for procedures on how to handle such information.    OSC investigators generally conduct either a telephonic or on-site interview with witnesses.  You will be responsible for arranging access to witnesses by way of scheduling the interviews and arranging for a secure location if interviews are conducted on-site.  As the POC, you must ensure that 1) witnesses are aware of their responsibility to provide truthful testimony; 2) subjects of the investigation are aware that OSC permits them to be represented personally by counsel during their interviews; 3) witnesses are aware of their responsibility to protect classified, privileged or otherwise protected information; and 4) that management officials are aware that an agency attorney generally has no right to be present at witness/subject interviews.   Agency attorneys may not sit in on OSC interviews of agency employees for informational AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   41    While you may serve as a legal advisor to management officials related to this case, purposes or to represent the agency.  Under AFI 51-1102, it is Air Force policy that all Air Force employees fully cooperate with OSC investigations, to include retrieving documents and information at your request as well as being available for an interview with OSC.  In the event you encounter an uncooperative employee, please notify my office immediately.  You should be aware that OSC reserves the right to contact witnesses directly as they deem appropriate.     please be aware of the coordination and reviewing authorities outlined in AFI 51-1102.  Specifically, corrective actions may not be taken and disciplinary actions may not be proposed without first coordinating with SAF/GCA.  POCs must make management officials aware of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 1214(f), which states that during the course of any OSC investigation, no disciplinary action shall be taken against any employee for any alleged prohibited activity under investigation or for any related activity without the prior approval of the Special Counsel.   If such disciplinary action is contemplated, contact SAF/GCA through [AFLOA/JACL-LLFSC, AFMC/JA, and/or AFRC/JA] prior to proposing such action.  Further, OSC may request ADR/mediation or attempt to broker a settlement agreement You are required to keep [AFLOA/JACL-LLFSC, AFMC/JA, AFRC/JA, and/or between the complainant and the Air Force.  In the event this occurs, you must contact [    ] immediately, who will notify SAF/GCA.  You are not authorized to engage with OSC on settlement negotiations at this time.

However, in the event of a major event, you should provide an update immediately.  Major events would include your completion of OSC requests, OSC’s request for ADR/mediation, OSC’s request for settlement discussions and OSC informing you that their investigation is closed.

I am employed by the Department of the Air Force as a _____________ (job title) for ________________ (office symbol) at _________________ (office location).    I request that the General Counsel of the Air Force appoint an attorney to represent me.  I do not intend to hire a private attorney from outside the Department of Defense.  I understand that if I hire a private attorney the Air Force will not reimburse any expenses that I incur with the private attorney except in highly unusual circumstances as personally determined by and subject to the advance approval of the General Counsel of the Department of Defense.   The facts and circumstances surrounding this investigation are stated as follows: ____________ (To the extent known, include a detailed explanation about the factual circumstances from which the OSC allegations against you likely arose).    I have also attached copies of all pleadings and other documents that OSC has given to me, as well as _________ (any other documentation relevant to the allegations).  I understand it is my burden to demonstrate the facts of the case sufficient to justify why an Air Force attorney should be appointed in my case.  I further understand that if I fail to bring forward sufficient evidence, my request will likely be denied.     I certify that my actions, which are the focus of the OSC investigation, were done in the course of my duties as a [civilian employee or military member] of the Air Force and that I have not been notified of the Air Force taking any disciplinary action against me as a result of the alleged conduct that is the focus of the OSC investigation.   I understand that if the Air Force appoints an attorney to represent me, that attorney will represent me and consult with me on my personal interests related to the OSC investigation.  I understand my consultations with this attorney will be protected by the attorney-client privilege.  I further understand this attorney will only represent me for the matter under investigation by OSC and only for the duration of the investigation.  I understand in no circumstance will the representation include assistance for any other matters, including but not limited to advising me on potential disciplinary actions proposed or taken against me and/or representing me in front of the Merit System Protection Board.    AFI51-1102  23 APRIL 2015   43  I understand that I may terminate my appointed attorney representation for any reason, and if I do so that the Air Force has no obligation to appoint another attorney to represent me.

Pursuant to AFI 51-1102, the AF Judge Advocate General or his designee shall appoint a judge advocate or attorney advisor after notification and consultation with that attorney’s commander or MAJCOM (or equivalent) staff judge advocate.   You will be notified by [AFLOA/JACL-LLFSC, AFMC/JA, AFRC/JA and/or NGB/JA] of the name of your appointed counsel and his/her contact information.    Legal representation has been approved to provide you legal advice with respect to the above-referenced OSC Investigation.  Your appointed counsel shall diligently represent you; however, legal representation is specifically limited to providing advice during the investigation, in accordance with AFI 51-1102.  Your appointed counsel may advise you on your participation in the OSC investigation and assist you with any information you provide to OSC (whether in the form of documents, interviews or testimony).  Attached for your information is OSC’s Policy on Legal Representation at OSC Interviews (dated March 15, 2002), including OSC’s required Designation of Personal Legal Representative Form.    An attorney-client relationship shall be established and continued between you and your assigned counsel.  Unless required or allowed by law, regulation, or professional responsibility ethical rules, your appointed attorney must maintain attorney-client confidentiality with respect to communications with you that were made during the time period the appointed attorney was representing you.  You may terminate your appointed attorney representation for any reason.  However, the AF has no obligation to appoint another attorney to represent you if you terminate the appointed attorney representation.    In the event the attorney wishes to withdraw from representing you, your attorney must submit a request for withdrawal to the General Counsel of the AF who has the authority to approve or deny such request.  Requests for termination may be approved where your appointed counsel (1) determines that (a) you are not a subject of the OSC investigation, or (b) you were acting outside the scope of your official responsibilities when you engaged in the conduct that is the focus of the OSC investigation; and (2) the termination of representation does not violate the appointed attorney’s rules of professional conduct.

The AF General Counsel retains the discretion to terminate the detail of your appointed counsel as your legal representative if he determines legal representation is no longer in the best interest of the AF.  Regardless of the reason, at the termination of the representation, the attorney is required to maintain attorney-client confidentiality with respect to your communications, unless release of such communication is required or allowed by law, regulation, or rule of professional responsibility.   Pursuant to AFI 51-1102, you must cooperate in all OSC proceedings requested by the OSC or the AF, subject to proper exercise of rights pursuant to the Fifth Amendment, Article 31 of the UCMJ (for military members), or any applicable contractual requirements regarding statutory rights to union representation. Subject to this limitation, you are required to answer all questions truthfully and completely and request clarification of any questions that you do not clearly understand.     The representation by your appointed AF attorney for your personal interests only extends to matters directly related the OSC investigation.  The representation may not extend to any matters beyond the OSC investigation and will terminate at the end of the OSC investigation.  In no circumstance will the representation include assistance for any other matters, including but not limited to rendering advice on potential disciplinary actions proposed or taken and/or representation in front of the Merit System Protection Board.  Pursuant to AFI 51-1102, AF resources cannot be used to provide legal representation for a civilian employee with respect to an AF disciplinary action against the employee for committing or participating in a prohibited personnel practice or for engaging in improper or illegal conduct, regardless of whether that participation or conduct is also the basis for the disciplinary action proposed by OSC.
