This  volume  outlines  the  basic  policy  and  guidance  for  AFSOF  intelligence personnel in the execution of the intelligence standardization and evaluation (Stan/Eval) program specific  to  qualification  in  a  duty  position  within  an  AFSOF  unit.    It  provides  intelligence evaluators  and  examinees  with  procedures  and  evaluation  criteria  to  be  used  during  periodic evaluations.  Unit-level guidance may expand upon the basic procedures contained in this AFI, but in no case will it be less restrictive. 1.2.  Waivers.  MAJCOM/A2s will courtesy-copy AFSOC/A2 regarding all waiver requests and responses.  AFSOC/A2 will notify AF/A2DF of significant trends in waiver correspondence if such correspondence indicates the need to readdress existing policy and guidance. 1.3.  Responsibilities. 1.3.1.  AFSOC/A2, in addition to Lead Command and MAJCOM responsibilities outlined in AFI 14-202, Volume 2, shall convene an intelligence standardization and evaluation working group  annually  to  review  this  instruction,  AFSOF  unit  standardization  and  evaluation policies,  and  procedures  for  AFSOF.    Working  group  participants  will  include  applicable active representatives with reserve participants coordinated through AFRC/A2F. 1.3.2.  Unit Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO).  In addition to duties outlined in AFI 14-202, Volume  2, a Standardization/Evaluation Board (SEB) to address positive and negative trends in training and evaluations.  (T-3) analysis  by the  SIO rigorous trend shall ensure chairing 1.3.2.1.  Develop written guidance for the conduct of SEBs. 1.3.2.2.  Conduct an SEB at least annually. 1.3.2.3.  Submit  SEB  minutes  to  HQ  AFSOC/A2F  within  30  calendar  days  of  SEB.  AFRC  units  route  SEB  minutes  through  AFRC/A2F.    Substantive  data  and  trends  are forwarded to HAF/A2 and appropriate MAJCOM partner A2s. 1.3.3.  Stan/Eval Program Manager (Chief of Unit Intelligence Stan/Eval, as applicable).  In addition to duties outlined in AFI 14-202, Volume 2, the Stan/Eval Program Manager shall organize and participate in the SEB.  Develop courses of action (COA) to correct negative training and evaluation trends making recommendations to the SIO.  Establish and document procedures to monitor COA progress until negative trends are resolved.  (T-3) 1.4.  Procedures. 1.4.1.  At a minimum, AFSOF personnel shall undergo a periodic mission (MSN) evaluation at least every 24 months.  (T-1) 1.4.2.  Unit Stan/Eval shall: 1.4.2.1.    Monitor  and  provide  oversight  on  individual  periodic  evaluation  due  dates  and eligibility windows to ensure periodic evaluations are scheduled in a timely manner.  (T-2)   4  AFI14-2AFSOFV2  23 DECEMBER 2014 1.4.2.2.  Document  all  evaluations  on  AF  Form  4381,  Intelligence  Gradesheet,  and maintain  examinations  until  AF  Forms  4350,  Certificate  of  Intelligence  Qualification, and trend analysis are complete.  (T-3) 1.4.2.3.  Document  all  Master  Question  File  (MQF)  question  reviews  and  forward updated questions to HQ AFSOC/A2F.  (T-3) 1.4.2.4.  Ensure all unit intelligence members will have access to MQFs.  Closed book tests will be used to evaluate, as a minimum, knowledge of the mission and duty position-specific role in the mission.  (T-3) 1.4.2.5.  All evaluations shall include a written exam administered as a pre-requisite for the performance based portion of the evaluation.  (T-3) 1.4.2.6.  Conduct 100% accountability of all hardcopy exams during monthly inventories and document inventory results.  (T-3) 1.4.2.7.  Ensure  all  examination  materials  are  clearly  marked  “Controlled  Item-Test Material” on the top and bottom of each page of the exams as well as on cover sheets and each exam will also be labeled with a unique control number IAW AFI 36-2605, Chapter 5.  (T-3) 1.4.2.8.  All  classified  exams  will  be  marked  IAW  The  Intelligence  Community Classification  and  Control  Markings  Implementation  Manual,  V2,  Edition  1  (Version 2.1), 5 January 2009 and Executive Order 12958, as amended.  (T-3) 1.4.2.9.  Test Compromise.  If an exam was/could have been compromised, the SIO will notify the unit commander who will determine if a Command-Directed Investigation into the  facts  and  circumstances  is  appropriate  direct  an  investigation  to  document  the underlying facts and circumstances.  (T-3) 1.4.2.10.  Transfer  of  Qualification  Training  and  Evaluation  Record.    Stan/Eval  shall transfer  training  and  evaluation  records  to  members  when  they  depart  the  unit  of assignment  during  a  permanent  change  of  station  (PCS)  or  permanent  change  of assignment (PCA).  If the databases being used to track training/certification do not allow for  inter-command  transfer,  upon  PCS  or  PCA,  members  shall  hand  carry  hard-copy evaluation records to their gaining organization.  When circumstances prevent the ability to  hand-carry  records,  the  losing  unit  will  mail  the  records  to  the  gaining  unit.    Upon retirement or separation, Stan/Eval will give the record and all its contents to the member.  (T-3) 1.4.2.11.  Maintain  a  record  to  document  the  disposition  of  training  and  evaluation records.  Disposition documentation will be maintained for 12 months.  (T-3) 1.4.3.  A  SPOT  evaluation  is  the  SIO’s  tool  to  audit  processes  rather  than  individuals.  Stan/Eval  will  use  SPOT  evaluations  to  assess  adherence  to  written  guidance  or  TTP implementation, for example. Stan/Eval will develop written guidance on SPOT evaluation procedures.  SPOT evaluations will be documented in Memos for Record (MFRs).  (T-2) 1.4.4.  No-Notice evaluations have two categories:  SIO-directed or random.  All no-notice evaluations will be reported in SEB minutes.  (T-3) AFI14-2AFSOFV2  23 DECEMBER 2014   5  1.4.5.  SIO-Directed  No-Notice  Evaluations.    SIO-directed  no-notice  evaluations  assess  an intelligence  professional’s  qualification(s)  after  another  individual  observes  routinely substandard  performance  or  one-time  performance  that  jeopardizes  the  mission.    The observer  will  submit  an  MFR  to  Stan/Eval,  recommending  a  SIO-Directed  no-notice evaluation.  The Chief of Stan/Eval shall review the recommendation and forward to the SIO for  approval.    If  the  recommendation  is  approved,  Stan/Eval  will  conduct  the  no-notice evaluation as soon as reasonable.  Once the evaluation is complete, the Intelligence Evaluator (IE) will determine an appropriate rating/course of action  IAW AFI 14-202V2, Chapter 5, and document on AF Form 4350.  (T-2) 1.4.6.  Random No-Notice Evaluations.  Random no-notice evaluations assess the unit’s daily performance and training effectiveness, IAW AFI 14-202V2, paragraph 5.2.3.3.  Each year Stan/Eval shall conduct random no-notice evaluations of a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the unit’s total number of qualified intelligence personnel measured at the beginning of each calendar  year.  Stan/Eval will randomly select  members to be evaluated each month or as required to meet the minimum 10%.  All qualified intelligence personnel are eligible for no-notice evaluations regardless of the time since their last evaluation.  Results of random, no-notice evaluations will be documented on Stan/Eval Memorandum for Records (MFRs).  If a member elects, before the evaluation is conducted, to use the random no-notice evaluation to satisfy the requirement for a periodic evaluation; the IE will also document the evaluation on AF Form 4350.  (T-2) 1.4.7.  Prior to any formal evaluation conducted by a qualified  Intelligence Evaluator (IE), the examinee must have completed all mission qualification training (MQT) or specialized training  requirements,  as  outlined  AFI  14-2AFSOF,  Volume  1,  AFSOF  Unit  Intelligence Training.    Additionally,  the  examinee  should  have  on  file  an  AF  Form  4381,  Intelligence Gradesheet,  from  an  Intelligence  Qualification  Trainer  for  each  area  listed  in  Table  2.1., Intelligence  Evaluations.    The  gradesheets  can  be  filed  in  the  individual’s  qualification training record or in the on-line documentation system.  (T-2) 1.4.8.  IEs  shall  use  the  evaluation  criteria  contained  in  this  volume  for  conducting  all intelligence  evaluations.    To  ensure  standard  and  objective  evaluations,  intelligence evaluators will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria. 1.4.9.  Prior  to  commencing,  the  IE  will  brief  the  examinee  on  the  evaluation  conduct, purpose,  requirements  and  applicable  criteria.    The  examinee  shall  accomplish  required planning in accordance with the duty position being evaluated.  The examinee shall provide the IE a copy of necessary data or materials.  (T-3) 1.4.10.  Required  areas  for  evaluation  are  shown  in  Table  2.1.,  Intelligence  Evaluations.  Evaluations should take place in conjunction with peacetime, home station aircrew training events to the maximum extent possible.  When it is impossible to evaluate a required area in a peacetime training event (e.g., actual deployment briefing or debriefing), examinations may be conducted via an alternate method (i.e., simulated, staged, or by verbal examination) in order to complete the evaluation.  The evaluator shall use the AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet, to assist in the completion of the AF Form 4350. 1.4.11.  The  IE  shall  thoroughly  debrief  all  aspects  of  the  evaluation.    This  debrief  shall include the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified) and any required additional training.  (T-3)   6  AFI14-2AFSOFV2  23 DECEMBER 2014 1.5.  Grading  Instructions.  The  IE  shall  compare  examinee  performance  for  each  area accomplished  during  the  evaluation  with  the  standards  provided  in  this  volume  and  assign  an appropriate  grade for the area.  Derive the overall intelligence evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite for the observed events and tasks IAW this instruction.  Grading will be conducted in the following manner:  (T-2) 1.5.1.  IEs shall use the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades.  IE judgment must be exercised when the wording for general graded areas is subjective and when  specific  situations  are  not  covered.    .    IEs  will  be  expected  to  use  their  personal experience and knowledge in the assessment of examinee performance and determination of overall  grade.   Discrepancies or issues with  grading or unsatisfactory performance will be resolved by the SIO. 1.5.2.  General Criteria.  The following general grading criteria applies to grading individual items: 1.5.2.1.  Qualified (Q).  Performance is correct.  Quickly recognizes and corrects errors. 1.5.2.2.  Qualified  with  discrepancies  (Q-).    Performance  is  safe,  but  indicates  limited proficiency, makes errors of omission or commission. 1.5.2.3.  Unqualified  (U).    Performance  is  unsafe  or  indicates  lack  of  knowledge  or ability. 1.6.  Additional Training.  Intelligence Evaluators are responsible for recommending additional training  as  necessary.    Document  any  additional  training  and  completion  IAW  AFI  14-202, Volume 2.  (T-2) 1.7.  Unsatisfactory  Performance.  Examinees  receiving  an  overall  unqualified  grade  (“Q-3”) shall be placed in supervised status until recommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation  is  successfully  accomplished.    If  an  examinee  receives  a  “Q-3”  on  a  mission evaluation, the examinee may not perform mission duties or specialized duties unsupervised until remedial actions are accomplished.  If an examinee receives a “Q-3” on a specialized evaluation, the examinee may not perform specialized duties until remedial actions are accomplished, but may perform mission duties unless specifically restricted.  (T-2) failure  of either the  written  or  performance  based 1.7.1.  Upon  the  initial  failure  of  either  the  written  examination  or  performance  based evaluation,  the  intelligence  evaluator  will  determine  remedial  training  required.    Upon  the second a Standardization/Evaluation  and  Training  Review  Board  (STRB)  will  be  convened  to determine a course of action.  (T-3) 1.7.2.  Conduct STRB.  Unlike SEBs which address programmatic stan/eval issues, STRBs are convened to address an individual’s issues (e.g. failed examinations, failed evaluations, failure to attain/maintain proficiency or failure to progress).  (T-3) 1.7.3.  STRBs  shall  include  a  training  representative,  stan/eval  representative  and  the supervisor.  (T-3) 1.7.4.  Stan/Eval shall compile STRB minutes with recommendations for  remedial training and/or other courses of action and forward to the SIO for review and final approval.  (T-3) evaluation, AFI14-2AFSOFV2  23 DECEMBER 2014   7  1.7.5.  Stan/Eval shall file approved STRB minutes in the member’s training and evaluation record (soft copy).  (T-3) 1.7.6.  The person responsible for the majority of an individual’s qualification training should not  perform  the  initial  qualification  evaluation  for  that  same  individual.    Recurring evaluations may be performed by any certified IE.   8  AFI14-2AFSOFV2  23 DECEMBER 2014 Chapter 2 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  General.  Intelligence personnel must complete initial and periodic evaluations to attain and maintain their qualification IAW AFI 14-202, Volume 2.  Evaluations typically consist of two areas:  knowledge and task evaluation.  Evaluations must include all required areas as depicted in Table 2.1.  All evaluations will be graded using the criteria in Chapter 3.  (T-1) 2.2.  Intelligence  Mission  Qualification  Evaluation.  The  evaluation  must  be  documented  in the individual’s qualification training record or in the on-line documentation system.  (T-2) 2.2.1.  Knowledge Evaluation.  Knowledge evaluations will be conducted as part of the initial and  periodic  mission  qualification  evaluations  to  test  the  examinee’s  understanding  of AFSOF concepts and operations.  Examinees will complete a knowledge test from the unit’s master  question  file  (MQF)  covering  mission  qualification  evaluation  subject  areas.  Examinations will be recorded on the AF Form 4350.  Research, analysis and dissemination (RAD)  and  intelligence  preparation  of  the  operational  environment  (IPOE)  involves knowledge  intelligence  personnel  should  be  applying  throughout  all  areas  of  performance task evaluations and will be evaluated as subsets of each applicable performance task.  (T-2) 2.2.2.  Task  Evaluation.    Units  shall  assemble  materials  using  current  intelligence,  unit tasking and area of responsibility (AOR) scenarios that incorporate all appropriate evaluation requirements from Table 2.1.  Deployments are prohibited from being used in the evaluation process.  (Real  world  contingencies  may  provide  a  unique  opportunity  to  conduct  an evaluation;  however,  factors  beyond  the  control  of  the  examinee  and  IE  may  preclude  its successful  completion).    The  following  guidelines  are  provided  to  assist  in  constructing evaluation materials:  (T-2) 2.2.2.1.  Order of Battle (OB).  This section includes both manual and automated OB. 2.2.2.1.1.  (Manual)  The number of coordinates in the OB plotting exercise should be  of  sufficient  volume  to  be  challenging,  yet  not  so  overwhelming  that  the  time taken  is  beyond  that  necessary  to  determine  proficiency.    Examinee  should  have  a variety of threats/items to plot to ensure correct symbology is used.  The exercise may include both geographic coordinates (geocoords) and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) coordinates.  The scenario may include erroneous information to mirror the fog of war by including intentionally incorrect coordinates or types of threats for that particular AOR, thereby allowing the Intelligence Evaluator to assess the examinee’s ability  to  identify  errors  and  question  the  validity  of  information.    When  using  a scenario  developed  by  the  examinee,  OB  coordinates  listed  on  Mission  Evaluation Worksheet  will  be  evaluated  by  the  IE  for  accuracy.    The  examinee  may  use  MIL STD 2525C, Common Warfighting Symbology, for reference. 2.2.2.1.2.  (Automated)  Examinee should be provided with a variety of OB sources from which to pull data.  When using an examinee-developed scenario, evaluate the examinee’s ability to develop and save threat files, insert accurate data, load, update, and  purge  data  to  ensure  quality  control  of  the  displayed  data  and  question  the information’s accuracy for a particular AOR.  Ensure the opportunity exists for the examinee to be evaluated on his or her ability to manipulate the OB displays and print AFI14-2AFSOFV2  23 DECEMBER 2014   9  using the intelligence support systems available.  Evaluate the examinee’s ability to convert coordinates between geocoords to MGRS and DD/MM/SS to DD/MM.mm. 2.2.2.2.  Intelligence  Briefings.    Briefings  should  be  assembled  from  information provided  by  the  evaluator;  message  traffic,  intelligence  reports,  imagery,  and  other sources that are used to evaluate the mission areas may be used to fulfill this requirement.  Evaluated briefings shall include all information tasked in the graded areas list on Table 2.1. (i.e. changeover, pax/deployment, battlestaff, mission/alert, and step briefings). 2.2.2.3.  Air  Tasking  Order  (ATO)/Airspace  Control  Order  (ACO)/Special  Instructions (SPINS)/Air Support Request (ASR)/Special Tactics Support Request (STSR).  Scenario, actual contingency or exercise materials may be used for this purpose.  Provide enough information that the examinee’s unit is not the sole unit tasked in the tasking mechanism.  Ensure  the  opportunity  exists  to  evaluate  the  examinee’s  ability  to  break  out  the  ATO with  and  without  the  assistance  of  automated  mission  planning  tools.    Ensure  the opportunity exists to evaluate the examinee’s proficiency in identifying and breaking out the elements of ATO/ACO/SPINS/ASR/STSR to include but not limited to unit tasking, air  space  control,  landing  zone/drop  zone  (LZ/DZ),  and  personnel  recovery  (PR) information. 2.2.2.4.  Mission  Planning.    Actual  contingency  planning  or  exercise  materials  and imagery  may  be  used.    Ensure  the  opportunity  exists  to  evaluate  the  examinee’s proficiency in planning, coordinating and conducting the entire mission planning process. 2.2.2.5.  Mission  Tracking.    Scenario,  actual  contingency  or  exercise  communication tools  and  agency  contact  information  will  be  provided  by  the  evaluator.    Ensure  the opportunity  exists in  using  whatever communication means necessary chat tools such as MIRC to monitor mission execution, communicate  with  other  agencies  and  coordination  centers  and  document communication.    In  addition,  ensure  the  opportunity  exists  to  evaluate  the  examinee’s proficiency in monitoring blue force tracking feeds and filter relevant threat information from national intelligence broadcasts as required/available. 2.2.2.6.  Debriefing.    Debriefings  should  be  conducted  with  aircrew  and/or  battlefield airman whenever possible.  The evaluator may construct inject cards or coordinate with aircrew  and/or  battlefield  airman  to  identify  a  particular  threat  scenario  for  the debriefings.  Ensure there is enough activity to represent the typical level of detail for a threat scenario commensurate with unit AOR tasking.  Grade the examinee’s ability to control the debriefing, ask amplifying questions and recognize irrelevant information. 2.2.2.7.  Intelligence  Reports.    All  applicable  reports  (e.g.,  mission  reports  (MISREPs) and intelligence reports (INTREPs)) should be constructed using information provided in the  debriefing.  MISREPs  and  INTREPs  should  be  completed  IAW  MAJCOM/theater intelligence reporting directives. 2.2.2.8.  Geospatial  Data  Management.    In  order  to  accomplish  the  task  evaluation scenario, actual contingency or exercise materials may be used.  Actual systems should be available to replicate process of disseminating appropriate geospatial information and services (GI&S) products to tasking unit.  Provide a variety of tasking units and scenarios to demonstrate different product type, resolution, and timeliness requirements. the  examinee’s  proficiency to  evaluate   10  AFI14-2AFSOFV2  23 DECEMBER 2014 threats/hazards to identify  potential 2.2.2.9.  Terrain  Analysis  Scenario.    Actual  contingency  or  exercise  materials  may  be used.    Evaluate  the  examinee  on  his  or  her  ability  to  analyze  detailed  terrain  data, correctly the  mission,  accurately  position targets/objective areas and facilities elevated on the terrain, effectively utilize 360-degree azimuth/elevation  masks  for  access  analysis,  and  disseminate  analysis  to  appropriate users. 2.2.2.10.  Special Tactics Commander’s Back Brief.  Briefing should be assembled from information  provided  by  the  evaluator;  previous  briefings  given;  message  traffic, intelligence reports, imagery, and other sources that are used to evaluate other mission areas may be used to fulfill this requirement. 2.3.  External  Intelligence  Trainer  (EIT)  Evaluation.  EIT  evaluations  should  consist  of  a knowledge  examination  and  a  task  evaluation  and  should  be  conducted  IAW  AFI  14-202, Volume 2.  The EIT should demonstrate knowledge of the information presented by successful completion of a test based on the questions from the master question file (85 percent minimum to pass).    The  EIT  should  also  be  evaluated  on  his  or  her  ability  to  present  training  in  each applicable  sub-category  (threat  knowledge,  visual  recognition  (VR),  collection  &  reporting (C&R),  Personnel  Recovery  (PR)  and  force  protection  (FP).    Evaluators  should  give  the examinee no less than 4 hours’ notice of the subject matter or briefing topic for the evaluation.  (T-2) 2.3.1.  In  certain  circumstances  it  may  be  beneficial  to  certify  an  individual  to  conduct training in one or more  individual EIT events (e.g. C&R)  at a time.  The individual must complete the specific training identified for the event and be evaluated on the task or briefing element by an Intelligence Evaluator.  Document the evaluation in the on-line documentation system.  The individual must maintain currency for the subject matter according to AFI 14-2AFSOF, Volume 1, AFSOF Unit Intelligence Training. 2.3.2.  Subsequent  EIT  evaluations  may  be  conducted  as  part  of  the  periodic  mission evaluation. 2.3.3.  Grade all EITs using the criteria in Chapter 3. 2.4.  Intelligence Evaluator Evaluation.  IE evaluations shall be conducted IAW AFI 14-202, Volume 2.
