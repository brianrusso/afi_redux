Notes: Capture velocity is air velocity at any point in front of a hood necessary to capture a contaminant at that point and convey the contaminant into the hood. Capture velocity is a product of hood airflow rate and hood design. It is important to note that capture velocity refers to the centerline velocity, which is the air velocity along a line extending out from the center of the hood or duct, and does not describe the velocity distribution across the hood opening.

Notes:  According to AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2013-0008, Ventilation Technical Guide, 2nd ed., “A baseline survey for a ventilation system is the combination of collecting ventilation data in the form of volumetric flow rate, static pressure, and velocity pressure along with air sampling data to ensure exposures to the worker are acceptable.  Once a baseline survey is completed, the exposure to the worker, as determined by air sampling, can be linked to the ventilation system through the performance metrics (static pressure, velocity pressure, and volumetric flow rate) of the system. To determine whether a system is in compliance or not, technicians should compare future ventilation surveys to the baseline criteria, not design criteria.       33  AFQTP 4B051-18                                                     Journeyman Training Guide:  Mechanical Ventilation Systems    TASK STEPS  1.
