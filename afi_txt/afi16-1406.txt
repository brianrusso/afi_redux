Installation  commanders  categorize  contractors  operating  on  the  installation  as cleared  facility,  visitor  groups,  or  intermittent  visitors.  (T-0)  Cleared  facilities  are  discussed  in Chapter  5.  Contractor  operations  performing  less  than  90  days  qualify  as  intermittent  visitors Intermittent  visitors  may  operate  under  the  security  requirements  of  the  NISPOM  or  the installation  security  program.  Generally,  contractor  operations  in  excess  of  90  days  are designated visitor groups. Visitor Group limits and actions while on the installation are codified in Visitor Group Secuity Agreements. 4.2.  Development of the VGSA  . The industrial security specialist will ensure VGSA: 4.2.1.  Incorporates the visitor group into the AF Information Security Program. (T-1) 4.2.2.  A  separate  or  independent  VGSA  is  developed  for  subcontractors  when  prime  and subcontractors are not working at the same AF installation. If at the same location, a separate VGSA  is  not  required;  however,  at  a  minimum,  the  subcontractor  signs  the  prime contractor’s VGSA. (T-0) 4.2.3.  Prohibits  Visitor  Groups  from  establishing  their  own  Information  Technology  (IT) systems/networks  (Local  Area  Networks  [LAN],  Wide  Area  Network  [WAN],  Cellular phone/USB  Modem  as  WAN,  Wi-Fi  as  WAN,  etc.)  without  the  direct  permission  of governing  communications  and  responsible  information  systems  office.  If  permission  is granted,  the  Government  office  approving  the  contractor  system/network  is  responsible  for providing  oversight  to  the  contractor’s  system/network  to  ensure  the  system/network  is properly  accredited/authorized  and  all  DoD/AF  information  technology  requirements  are met. (T-0) 4.2.4.  Require contractor employees who need access to government IT are determined to be trustworthy by the completion of a favorable personnel security investigation commensurate with  assigned  duties  and  by  a  designated  government  official  prior  to  IT  access  being granted.  (T-0)  This  is  accomplished  through  the  system  authorization  access  request,  DD Form  2875,  process.  Reference  AFI  31-501  (or  applicable  revisions)  for  background investigation requirements. Information  Technology,  etc.),  procedures,  operating 4.2.5.

Clearances.  There  are  two  types  of  clearances  within  the  industrial  security  program.  A Facility  Security  Clearance  (FCL)  is  an  administrative  determination  by  Defense  Security Service (DSS) that a company is eligible for access to classified information. The other clearance is  Personnel  Security  Clearance  (PCL).  A  PCL  is  an  administrative  determination  that  a contractor  is  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  FCL  can  be  affected  if  adverse information  results  in  the  removal  of  a  PCL,  or  change  introducing  FOCI  indicators  of  those identified as key management personnel. 5.2.  Requesting  a  FCL.  Most  companies  bidding  on  a  classified  contract  have  an  FCL. However, a company may be awarded a contract and not be in possession of an FCL. Should this occur, the contracting office initiate a request for an FCL. (T-0) A sample FCL request letter can be obtained from the Defense Security Service (DSS) website, Industrial Security page. 5.2.1.  A company’s FCL can be verified through the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD) maintained by DSS. ISFD can verify the company’s safeguarding capability, address, CAGE code, and if the company requires a NID for access to proscribed information. 5.2.1.1.  To  gain  access  to  the  ISFD  complete  the  ISFD  System  Access  Request  form located on the DSS website, Information Systems ISFD web page. 5.2.1.2.  It  is  U.S.  policy  to  support  foreign  investment  in  the  United  States  consistent with  the  protection  of  the  national  security.  Foreign  Ownership,  Control,  or  Influence (FOCI)  is  a  set  of  processes  which  may  facilitate  foreign  investment  in  the  US.  These processes  become  necessary  to  make  a  determination  by  DSS  that  access  to  national defense  information  by  companies  impacted  by  FOCI  is  considered.  SAP  NID questions/submissions  will  be  reported  to  the  MAJCOM  SAP  Management  Office. Submit all (Collateral, SCI and SAP) NIDs in accordance with AFHB 16-1406. 5.2.1.3.  REVISED from 5.2.2.1. Program/project manager, contracting office, becoming aware of the sale of a contract or a company subject to FOCI must report this information to the servicing Wing Information Protection Office.

Visitor groups will report violations through their unit to the Wing  Information  Protection  Office.  Cleared  facilities  report  directly  to  the  Wing Information  Protection  Office.  The  Wing  Information  Protection  Office  reports  security violations to the HOF for cleared facilities. When contractors cause security incidents on AF installations,  Wing  Information  Protection  Office  (IP)  will  notify  the  contractor’s  Facility Security Officer (FSO) and Contracting Officer. (T-1) 5.4.2.  Program/project  managers  will  respond  to  the  DSS  requirements  and  provide  the Wing  Information  Protection  Office  a  copy  of  the  response.  (T-0)    Original  Classification Authorities are responsible for conducting damage assessments. See DoDM 5200.01, Vol 3, Enclosure 6. 5.4.2.1.  These  are  cases  of  external  Security  Violation  processing.  The  AF  receives notice  of  security  violations  occurring  at  an  industry  concerning  information  an  AF program or project manager uses is at risk or has been compromised. Specifc instructions are provided for each occurrence. 5.5.  Reporting  Espionage,  Sabotage,  and  Subversive  Activities.  Suspicious  activities  may extend  beyond  the  AF  and  endanger  the  defense  industrial  framework  of  our  nation  and  its governing principles.

The installation commander is the authority responsible for granting contractors  access  to  the  installation,  regardless  of  which  DoD  agency,  military  service component, or activity awarded the contract. 7.2.  Contractor  Visits  to  AF  Installations.  DoD  contractors  located  on  or  visiting  AF installations in  support of a classified  contract  must comply with  DoD 5220.22-M,  Chapter  6, Section 1, visit requirements. (T-0). 7.2.1.  Verify the information/accesses are authorized  via the DD  Form 254 on the contract for which the information is being released to fulfill the contract. (T-0) 7.2.2.  In  the  case  of  a  subcontractor,  review  the  subcontract  DD  Form  254.  The  Joint Personnel  Adjudication  System  (JPAS)  is  the  system  of  record  for  confirming  classified access eligibility for DoD employees and all contractor personnel. (T-0) 7.3.  AF  Visits  to  Contractor  Facilities.  AF  personnel  who  require  access  to  classified information  while  visiting  commercial  contractor  facilities  must  comply  with  the  visit  request submission requirements of DoD 5200.01, V1-4 and AFI 16-1404, DoD 5220.22-M, and/or the contractor location to be visited. (T-0). AFI16-1406  25 AUGUST 2015 23 Chapter 8 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS 8.1.  Special  Access  Program.  The  AF  assumes  cognizance  (instead  of  DSS  for  oversight responsibility) of Special Access Program contracts. Program Security Officers (PSO) coordinate with the appropriate contracting officer (CO) and program manager (PM) to validate DD Forms 254  contain  language  indicating  DSS  is  “carved  out”  of  program  oversight  and  identifies  AF Office  of  Special  Investigations,  Office  of  Special  Projects  (AFOSI/PJ)  as  having  security  and compliance  inspection  responsibility  in  accordance  with  the  NISP  and  AF  authorities  (T-0).  In these cases, a DD Form 254 may be completed only after endorsement by a PM and PSO. (T-0) COs may not delegate the authority to approve a SAP DD 254 (for specific SAP guidance also see  DoD  5220.22M-Sup  1,  NISPOM  Supplement,  NISP,  AFPD  16-7  and  AFI  16-701, Management  Administration  Oversight  of  Special  Access  Programs).  Non-SAP  classified material  and  CUI  kept  within  a  SAPF  does  not  fall  within  the  assessment  (or  self-assessment) purview  of  the  industrial  security  specialist.  Responsibility  for  such  material  rests  with  the applicable PSO (T-0). 8.2.  Sensitive Compartmented Information.  Program managers for SCI may relieve DSS and AF from security review and oversight responsibility for cleared facilities and/or visitor groups. This relief is normally limited to specific SCI information. Non-SCI classified material and CUI kept  within  a  SCIF  does  not  fall  within  the  assessment  purview  of  the  Information  Protection office. Responsibility for such material rests with the applicable SSO. 8.3.  Other  Access  Considerations  . The CO will engage program managers to validate a DD Form 254 requires access and adherence to other programs (e.g., Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), Restricted Data (RD), Critical Nuclear Weapons Design Information (CNWDI), Nuclear Command and Control Extremely Sensitive Information (NC2 ESI) and NATO. (T-0) 8.4.  NATO  . AF organizations will: 8.4.1.  Ensure  contracts  requiring  access  to  NATO  classified  materials  is  included  on  a  DD Form  254  when  applicable.

A  contract  may  be classified even though the contract document itself is not classified. Cleared  Facility—A non-government owned and operated industrial, educational, commercial, or  other  facility  for  which  DoD  has  made  an  administrative  determination  (from  a  security viewpoint) that the entity is eligible for and requires access to classified information of a certain category (Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret). Cognizant  Security  Agency  (CSA).—Executive  Branch  Agencies  authorized  to  establish  an industrial  security  program  to  safeguard  classified  information  under  the  jurisdiction  of  those agencies when disclosed or released to U.S. Industry. These agencies are DoD, DHS, DOE, CIA, and NRC. Cognizant Security Office—The designated Department of Defense (DoD) agency responsible for industrial security program administration. The Secretary of Defense (SedDef) has designated the  Defense  Security  Service  (DSS)  to  perform  this  function.  The  DSS  Director  has  further delegated  this  responsibility  downward  within  the  agency.  DSS  Regional  Directors  provide industrial  security  administration  for  contractor  facilities  located  within  their  respective geographic  area.  One  exception  for  which  AF  has  responsibility  is  DoD  contractors  on  AF installations designated as “visitor groups.” Functional  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)—Functional  OPR  examples  are  a  SAF directorate, A-Staff, or squadron that manages a security discipline and its associated proscribed or  collateral  information/material/equipment.  Examples  are  A/2  or  local  SSO  office  for  SCI; SAF-CIO, A/6, or communications squadron for COMSEC; etc. Industrial Security—the element of the security enterprise to ensure the safeguarding of classified  information  when  in  the  possession  of  U.S.  industrial  organizations,  educational institutions, and organizations or facilities used by contractors. Industrial  Security  Specialist—This  AF  position  administers  the  industrial  security  program most  commonly  located  on  a  Wing  staff  at  an  installation.  The  industrial  Security  Specialist  is responsible  for  overseeing  contractor  security  programs  and/or  operations  through  an  executed (signed by both parties) VGSA. AFI16-1406  25 AUGUST 2015 29 Installation—An  installation  is  an  area  in  which  the  AF  holds  a  real  property  interest  or  real property over which the AF has jurisdiction by agreement with a state or foreign government or by right  of occupation. The term  installation also includes all off-base or detached installations under the jurisdiction of the commander of the primary installation. Intermittent  Visitor—A  contractor  or  company,  cleared  per  the  National  Industrial  Secutiy Program (NISP) or Industrial Security Regulation, that require “entry” to an AF installation for brief  periods  of  time  on  a  scheduled  or  on  call  basis  to  perform  contractual  duties.  An intermittent visitor’s presence on an installation does not usually exceed 90 consecutive days. Invalidation—A  condition  at  a  cleared  facility  caused  by  changed  conditions  or  performance under  which  the  facility  may  no  longer  be  eligible  for  an  FCL  unless  the  facility  promptly initiates appropriate corrective actions. Major  Discrepancy—A condition, which resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in the loss or compromise of classified information. National  Industrial  Security  Program  Operating  Manual  (NISPOM)—DoD  5220.22-M establishes  the  standard  procedures  and  requirements  for  all  government  contractors,  with regards to classified information. National  Interest  Determination—a  determination  that  contractor  access  to  proscribed information is consistent with the national security interests of the United States. Proscribed Information—Proscribed information is Top Secret (TS); Communications Security (COMSEC) material, excluding controlled cryptographic items when unkeyed and utilized with unclassified  keys;  Restricted  Data  (RD);  Special  Access  Program  (SAP);  and  sensitive compartmented information (SCI). Reciprocity—A  reciprocal  condition,  relationship,  mutual  or  cooperative  agreement,  between two or more agencies, components, or departments agreeing to recognize and accept the efforts (e.g., requirements, procedures, actions, etc.) of the other in exchange for the same reparation. Visitor  Group—Any  contractor  operation,  cleared  per  the  NISP  or  Industrial  Security Regulation  that  requires  access  to  classified  information  (excluding  a  cleared  facility).  A contractor on an installation less than 90 days is categorized as an Intermittent Visitor and does not rquire a VGSA. The Installation Commander determines the categorization of the contractor operation based on the interaction with the serviced unit. Visitor Group Security Agreement—The VGSA is installation and Wing specific and traces its existence  to  installation  commander  authority  for  allowing  personnel  to  access  a  military installation; a documented and legally binding contractual agreement between an AF and a DoD contractor whereby the contractor commits to complying with, rendering, or performing specific security tasks or functions for compensation. The VGSA is different from, and in addition to the DD  Form  441,  Department  of  Defense  Security  Agreement,  and  DD  Form  254,  DoD Contract Security Classification Specifications, which are required.
