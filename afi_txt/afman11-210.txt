General Concepts. 1.1.1.  The  USAF  Instrument  Refresher  Program  (IRP)  is  a  two-part  program  designed  to provide USAF aircrews with the knowledge, procedures, and techniques required to achieve safe  and  effective  worldwide  mission  accomplishment  when  operating  under  Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).  Part 1 is the USAF Instrument Refresher Course (IRC).  This recurring requirement  is  primarily  an  interactive  classroom-based  training  event  conducted  IAW  this manual,  AFI  11-202  Volume  1,  Aircrew  Training,  and  MAJCOM  guidance.    Part  2  is  the open-book  Instrument  Examination.    This  examination  includes  USAF,  MAJCOM,  and Mission  Design  Series  (MDS)-specific  instrument  regulations  and  publications.    It  is  a requisite of the Instrument Flight Evaluation and is accomplished IAW this manual and AFI 11-202  Volume  2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation  Program,  and  MAJCOM  guidance.  Note:  parts 1 and 2 are separate events.  Part 2 is not a requirement to receive credit for Part 1. 1.1.2.  For the purpose of this manual, AFDW is considered a MAJCOM.  For the purpose of this manual, the term unit refers to Operations Group level activity.  MAJCOMs may adjust unit-level responsibilities as needed but no lower than the squadron level. 1.1.3.  Waivers.    Directive  guidance  (will,  shall,  must,  etc.)  throughout  this  publication  are tiered  IAW  AFI  33-360,  Publications  and  Forms  Management.

USAF,  AFRC,  and  ANG  pilots,  navigators,  and  combat  systems operators  (CSO),  or  any  other  pilot  operating  a  USAF  aircraft  on  active  flying  status  will complete the IRC every 17 months.  (T-1).  IRC currency will expire on the last day of the 17th month following the month in which the IRC was successfully completed (e.g. a class that was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12).  If other crewmembers are mandated by AFI 11-202V1, MAJCOM guidance, or unit policy to attend the IRC, they are required to attend the IRC on the same 17-month schedule.  (T-1). 2.1.1.1.  USAF  AIS  Attendance.    Successful  completion  of  the  AIS  curriculum  at  the USAF Advanced Instrument School satisfies IRC completion for that particular 17-month cycle. 2.1.1.2.  IRC Instructor.  IRC instructors who teach all blocks of instruction for the course may take credit for the IRC event. 2.1.1.3.  IRC  completion.  The instrument  exam  is  not  required to  receive credit for the IRC.    MAJCOMs  may  develop  IRC  specific  tests.    The  IRC  instructor  determines  who completes  the  course  and  will  ensure  the  information  is  forwarded  to  the  appropriate SARM or training office so that IRC completion can be recorded. 2.1.1.4.  Failure to complete IRC.  IRC is a mandatory continuation training item.  Refer to AFI 11-202V1 guidance for failure to complete continuation training requirements. 2.2.  IRC Instructor Qualifications. 2.2.1.  Instrument School Graduate.  IRC instructors must be graduates of the USAF AIS, the AF  AIS/Instrument  Pilot  Instructor  School  (AIS/IPIS)  formerly  taught  at  Randolph  AFB, TX,  the  SAC  Instrument  Flight  Course  (SIFC)/Advanced  Instrument  Flight  Course  (AIFC) formerly taught at Castle AFB, CA, or the US Army Instrument Flight Examiner Preparatory Course (EIFE-PC) taught at Annville, PA. (T-1).  The EIFE-PC is for helicopter pilots only.  In  the  event  a  unit  is  without  an  AIS,  AIS/IPIS,  SIFC/AIFC,  or  EIFE-PC  graduate,  HQ AFFSA will process waivers to this manual on a case-by-case basis IAW paragraph 4.2. 2.2.1.1.  All instrument school graduates will automatically receive the special experience identifier  (SEI)  code  of  “OEV”  on  their  personnel  records.    They  will  also  receive  a certificate of course completion and an SEI code letter from AIS.  Note:  AF graduates of the  EIFE-PC  will  need  to  request  these  documents  from  AIS  upon  completion  of  the EIFE-PC and present them to their local unit training manager (UTM) in order to get this SEI code loaded into their records. 2.2.2.  IRC  instructors  must  be  an  instructor  pilot  (IP),  instructor  navigator  (IN),  instructor combat systems operator (ICSO), a previously qualified instructor in a DOD aircraft, or have an equivalent level of experience. (T-1).  The intent is to have rated flyers teach rated flyers about instrument flying. AFMAN11-210  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 7 2.2.3.  Contracted and certified civilian instructors may teach the IRC.  These IRC instructors must  attend  AIS  if  not  previous  AFAIS,  AFAIS/IPIS,  SIFC/AIFC,  or  EIFE-PC  graduates. (T-1). 2.2.4.  Guest  speakers  from  other  agencies  such  as  weather,  air  traffic  control  (ATC), aerospace  physiology,  flight  medicine,  etc.,  are  highly  encouraged.    At  installations  where these  subject  matter  experts  are  assigned,  the  IRP  administrator  may  arrange  timely  and relevant  guest  speaker  presentations  during  the  IRC,  with  special  emphasis  on  recurring USAF  mishap  causal  factors.    For  example,  every  effort  should  be  made  for  an  aerospace physiologist  or  flight  surgeon  to  present  spatial  disorientation  and  situational  awareness topics and how they factor into USAF mishaps. 8 AFMAN11-210  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 Chapter 3 IRC DEVELOPMENT AND CONTENT 3.1.  IRC Development. 3.1.1.  Unit-Level Development.  The most appropriate level for IRC content development is at  the  unit  level.    Operational  commanders  and  unit-level  IRC  instructors  are  in  the  best position  to  accurately  judge  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  their  unit’s  aircrews.    The primary  objective  of  the  IRC  should  be  to  increase  USAF  combat  capability  by  providing aircrews  advanced  instrument  flight  rules  (IFR)  knowledge  and  techniques  to  safely  fly worldwide.    The  IRC  may  review  normal  instrument  procedures,  but  it  should  also  expose aircrews to new and evolving procedures.  Normal operations should not be the basis for the unit’s entire IRC.  The following guidance will help instructors decide on what to cover in an IRC. 3.1.1.1.  Refresh  aircrew  members  on  information  on  instrument  knowledge,  especially those topics not seen on a daily basis. 3.1.1.2.  Instruct procedures and information that have changed since the last IRC. 3.1.1.3.  Reinforce topics the Wing staff, Stan/Eval, training offices, Air Traffic Control, base  operations  personnel,  weather  personnel,  flight  surgeons,  etc.  have  identified  as weak areas.  Guest speakers in such areas of expertise are highly encouraged. 3.1.1.4.  Emphasize  instrument  procedures  deemed  necessary  to  ensure  successful accomplishment of the unit mission. 3.1.2.  CBT  Development.    CBTs  will  be  developed  IAW  DoD  and  AF  directives  and applicable  36-series  regulations.    Additionally,  CBTs  will  be  updated  as  new  or  revised instructions  and  manuals  are  released.    CBTs  will  be  approved  by  their  respective MAJCOM/A3 divisions prior to use.  (T-1). 3.1.3.  Simulator  Profile  Development.    Simulator  capabilities  vary  based  on  MDS  and  can be valuable training tools.  Regardless of the level of fidelity, a simulator profile specifically designed  for  IRC  training  provides  one  of  the  best  methods  to  reinforce  safe  instrument procedures and concepts.  Including emergency procedures in the IRC simulator is a valuable and encouraged technique (e.g. engine failure and transition to a Special Departure Procedure (SDP)).    Other  examples  would  be  a  pending  deployment  route  and  terminal  procedures, divert  base  approach  information,  missed  approach  procedures  and  techniques,  local  divert base familiarity, standard instrument departures (SID), obstacle departure procedures (ODP), etc.   This  list  is  not  all-inclusive, but  does  offer  some ideas  for structuring  an  IRC specific simulator profile. 3.1.4.  Sources of Academic Course Material.  Academic material for the IRC can come from multiple sources.  Some sources of IRC academic material include: 3.1.4.1.  HQ  AFFSA/XOT  SharePoint®.    The  HQ  AFFSA/XOT  SharePoint®  is  the central  reference  point  for  all  IRP  information.    The  site  contains  the  most  current  HQ AFFSA  Instrument  Examination  Test  Bank,  sample  outlines  for  individual  IRC  topics, and  briefings  used  by  the  HQ  AFFSA  AIS  instructor  cadre.    All  material  can  be AFMAN11-210  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 9 downloaded and used by the unit IRP administrators to develop their own unit IRP.  The SharePoint® also provides links to other sites offering instrument-related information. 3.1.4.2.  USAF AIS.  The instructors at AIS provide a great deal of information helpful to IRC  instructors.    Contact  AIS  at  DSN  884-7073  or  visit  the  HQ  AFFSA/XOT SharePoint®. 3.1.4.3.  MAJCOMs may also  develop  IRC course materials  (i.e. CBT or  MDS  specific simulator profiles) for use by unit-level IRC instructors. 3.2.  IRC Content Requirements. 3.2.1.  IRC Content.  As a minimum, the IRC will contain instruction in each of the following required  categories:  new  or  revised  regulations/instructions,  instrument  procedures,  flight planning, weather and local related hazards, spatial disorientation, “Hot Topics,” and head-up displays (HUD) (if applicable). (T-1). 3.2.1.1.  Hot Topics.  The IRC instructor will teach any briefing items found in the “Hot Topics” section of the HQ AFFSA/XOT SharePoint®. (T-1). 3.2.1.2.  HUDs.    IRC  instructors  in  units  possessing  aircraft  equipped  with  HUDs  will cover items  found in  the lesson plan titled “The Head-Up Display  (HUD).”  (T-1).  The lesson  plan  is  on  the  HQ  AFFSA/XOT  SharePoint®.    If  the  aircraft’s  HUD  is  not authorized  for  use  in  instrument  meteorological  conditions  (IMC),  presentation  of  this subject cannot count towards the course length specified in paragraph 3.2.3. 3.2.2.  Method  of  Instruction.  The  IRC will be taught  in  a classroom  format by  a qualified IRC instructor in accordance with this manual and applicable MAJCOM supplements. (T-1).  Simulator profiles and/or CBT programs specifically designed for IRC training may be used for IRC classroom credit IAW paragraphs 3.2.3.1 and 3.2.3.2.  However, supplemental forms of instruction (simulators, CBT, video, guest speaker, etc.) are not authorized as a sole means of IRC completion.  A portion of the IRC must utilize instructor based training (IBT) IAW paragraph 3.2.3.4. (T-1). 3.2.3.  Course Length.  The IRC will be at least six hours in length. (T-1).  Time spent taking the Instrument Examination does not count towards the six-hour IRC course length since the exam  is  aligned  separately  and  is  a  requisite  for  the  qualification  portion  of  the  check  ride IAW AFI 11 202V2. 3.2.3.1.  CBT  Credit.    Completion  of  a  MAJCOM  approved  CBT  may  fulfill  up  to  a maximum  of  four  hours  of  the  IRC  classroom  credit.    Aircrew  completing  a  CBT program will provide a completion certificate to the IRC instructor. (T-1). 3.2.3.2.  Simulator  Credit.    If  the  unit  IRC  program  includes  simulator  training  profiles specifically designed for IRC training, a maximum of two hours of the IRC may be spent in a simulator as classroom credit. 3.2.3.3.  Other  Credits.    Other  methods  of  instruction  that  relate  to  IRC  topics  may  be utilized, such as videos, expert guest speakers, tours, etc.  These other methods can fulfill a maximum of one hour of classroom credit for each event. 10 AFMAN11-210  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 3.2.3.4.  IBT  Credit.    If  a  combination  of  CBTs,  simulator  profiles,  and/or  other instructional  methods  is  utilized,  a  minimum  of  one  hour  of  classroom  IBT  is  still required to complete the IRC. 3.2.3.4.1.  IBT Requirements.  When using combination credit, IRC instructors must still  cover revised regulations/instructions,  unit-designated  and  HQ  AFFSA/XOT  SharePoint®  “Hot Topics,” and local instrument trends and procedures. (T-1). following  during the the IBT  portion:   new  and 3.3.  Requisite Instrument Examination. 3.3.1.  The purpose of the requisite Instrument Examination is to provide an extensive open-book  review  of  instrument  procedures  and  other  instrument-related  subjects.    The  test  is synchronized  with  the  instrument  and/or  qualification  checkride  IAW  AFI  11-202V2  and AFI 11-2MDSV2. 3.3.2.  HQ AFFSA Instrument Examination Test Bank.  HQ AFFSA/XOT maintains the HQ AFFSA  Instrument  Examination  Test  Bank  (i.e.  MQF  or  PEX  QDB)  in  electronic  format.  The test bank is  available for download via the  HQ AFFSA/XOT SharePoint®.  The MQF and PEX QDB are not considered secure databases; they are available for review but will not be referenced during the Instrument Examination. 3.3.2.1.  Changes to individual questions in the HQ AFFSA Instrument Examination Test Bank are not  authorized.  Do not use questions if  changes in  source material  render the question invalid. 3.3.2.2.  The IRP administrator, with the assistance of IRC instructors, will act as the unit conduit  for  deficiencies  and  updates  to  questions  in  the  HQ  AFFSA  Instrument Examination Test Bank.  IRP administrators will utilize the process outlined in AFI 11-202V2 to notify HQ AFFSA/XOT of any necessary changes to the questions or answers contained in the HQ AFFSA Instrument Examination Test Bank. (T-1). 3.3.3.  Unit  Instrument Examination Test  Bank.    The unit instrument  examination test bank includes  the  HQ  AFFSA  Instrument  Examination  Test  Bank  and  any  locally  developed questions as described in paragraph 3.3.4.5. 3.3.3.1.  The  IRP  administrator  is  responsible  for  the  currency  of  the  unit’s  instrument examinations test bank IAW AFI 11-202V2. (T-1).  The latest version of the HQ AFFSA Instrument Examination Test Bank (as indicated on the HQ AFFSA/XOT SharePoint®) is  used  to  generate  any  requisite  instrument  examinations.    The  HQ  AFFSA  Instrument Examination Test Bank is dated to indicate when the latest changes were made. 3.3.4.  Requisite Instrument Examination Content.  The requisite instrument examination will contain a minimum of 40 questions taken from the HQ AFFSA Instrument Examination Test Bank  and  a  minimum  of  10  locally  developed  questions  specific  to  the  unit  mission  and/or aircraft type. (T-1).  The test will be constructed as follows: 3.3.4.1.  15  questions  (minimum)  -  AFMAN  11-217V1,  Instrument  Flight  Procedures (T-1). 3.3.4.2.  10 questions (minimum) - AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules (T-1). 3.3.4.3.  10 questions (minimum) - Flight Information Publications (FLIP) (T-1). AFMAN11-210  1 SEPTEMBER 2017 11 3.3.4.4.  5 questions (minimum) - AFH 11-203 Vols 1 & 2, Weather for Aircrews (T-1). 3.3.4.5.  10 questions (minimum) - Locally developed.
