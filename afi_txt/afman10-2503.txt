Overview.  How  Air  Force  installations  and  units  operate  in  a  chemical,  biological, radiological,  nuclear,  and  high  yield  explosive  environment  is  an  evolving  effort.    In  2002  the Air  Force  implemented  the  counter-chemical  warfare  concept  of  operations  (CONOPS)  that changed  how  installations  prepared  for  and  responded  to  conventional  chemical  munitions attacks.    The  AF  further  defined  the  most  probable  threat  as  tactical  ballistic  missiles.    That reevaluation  of  the  threat  became  the  basis  for  developing  tactics,  techniques  and  procedures (TTP)  for  installations  to  recover  and  continue  mission  operations.    In  2003,  the  AF  began investigating  potential  vulnerabilities  for  biological  attacks  by  conducting  exercises  at  Kunsan AB, Korea.  These  exercises led to  the development and refinement of  TTPs for responding to conventional  and irregular biological  warfare attacks.  The resulting  counter-biological  warfare CONOPS  was  institutionalized  through  two  Air  Force  Instructions:  AFI  10-2603,  Emergency Health  Powers  on  Air  Force  Installations  and  AFI  10-2604,  Disease  Containment  Planning Guidance.  In 2009, the Air Force published and began implementing the Counter-Radiological Warfare  CONOPS.    This  CONOPS  is  being  institutionalized  through  this  document  and  other Air Force and multiservice directives. 1.1.1.  The  nuclear  threat  has  been  exhaustively  studied.    The  AF  will  review  existing information  to  determine  a  need  to  change  TTPs  for  nuclear  weapon  threats.    This  manual will incorporate the information from all CBRNE efforts as they mature in order to provide installations guidance to prepare for, respond to, and recover from a conventional or irregular CBRNE attack. 1.1.2.  In  addition  to  developing  Counter-Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological  CONOPS,  the AF has made changes to its emergency response procedures and operations.  The impetus for these  changes  includes  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive  –  5,  Management  of Domestic  Incidents  (28  February  2003),  The  National  Response  Framework,  and  the subsequent  Memorandum  from  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  (SecDef),  Homeland Defense  (26  January  2004).    These  references  mandated  the  integration  of  the  NRF  and HSPD-5 into Department of Defense (DOD) incident management and emergency response plans.  Information on the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) is in AFMAN 10-2502,  Air  Force  Incident  Management  System  (AFIMS)  Standards  and  Procedures.  Procedures  for  detailed  planning,  organization,  training,  and  response  and  recovery information  for accidents and natural  disasters are in  AFMAN 10-2504,  Air Force Incident Management Guidance for Major Accidents and Natural Disasters. 1.2.  Purpose.  This  Manual  provides  commanders,  staff,  key  agencies,  units  and  the  Disaster Response Force (DRF), which includes first and emergency responders, guidance to prepare for, prevent,  respond  to,  recover  from,  and  mitigate  an  enemy  attack  through  conventional  or irregular  warfare.    Additionally,  this  Manual  implements  the  AFIMS  in  compliance  with  the intent and guidelines in HSPD-5.  This Manual expands the guidance in AFI 10-2501, to provide installations  the  guidance  needed  to  sustain  and  continue  the  mission  after  an  attack  from  an enemy  state  or  terrorist  organization.    Installations  apply  the  applicable  procedures  from  this manual to develop CBRN plans for the hazards likely to affect the location.  Note:  Installations AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   7  with limited CBRNE defensive capability, the MAJCOM will determine what capabilities these installations will maintain to respond to a CBRNE attack. in  a  CBRNE  environment  are 1.3.  Mission.  Operations to  balance  mission continuation  with  force  survivability  to  maximize  mission  effectiveness  during  and  after  a CBRNE  event.    Towards  this  end,  the  concept  of  risk  assessment  is  an  integral  part  of  the equation.  Commanders will either accept or mitigate the risk based on threat and vulnerability assessments,  resources  available,  and  the  anticipated  or  actual  mission  impact.    This  Manual supports that process  by  providing key information, procedures, and actions needed to  prepare, survive, and restore mission capability after a CBRNE event. intended 1.4.  Operational  Environment.  An  operational  environment  (OE)  is  a  compilation  of interrelated conditions, circumstances, and influences that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the commander‘s decisions.  An assessment of the OE consists of a detailed analysis of  the  CBRNE  threats  and  hazards  and  the  political,  military,  economic,  social,  information, infrastructure,  physical  environment  and  time  variables  (PMESII-PT).    These  assessments determine the type of the OE that  forces will operate in.   MAJCOM and Air Operation Center staff  should  develop  a  picture  of  the  OE  for  their  area  of  responsibility  to  determine  the capabilities required. 1.4.1.  Threat  and  Hazard  Assessments.    Threat  and  hazard  assessments  are  used  to  assist commanders and planning functions to determine what threats they face at their installation or  a  deployed  location.    The  threat  and  hazard  assessment  provides  commanders  and planning  functions  an  idea  of  the  threat  or  hazards  that  exist  in  the  OE.    The  process  is discussed in more detail in AFMAN 10-2502 and Chapter 2 of this Manual. 1.4.2.  PMESII-PT.    PMESII-PT  is  a  joint  systems  approach  that  allows  commanders, planners,  and  support  staff  to  understand  the  OE.    The  PMESII-PT  variables  provide  a framework  for  understanding,  characterizing,  and  managing  CBRNE  threats  and  hazards specific to an OE.  Consideration of the variables of PMESII-PT can lead to the identification of  key  CBRNE  vulnerabilities.    A  conventional  adversary  has  all  of  these  variables,  with many  of  them  possessing  tangible  infrastructure  that  is  easily  identified  by  Intelligence, Surveillance,  and  Reconnaissance  (ISR).    An  irregular  adversary  has  the  same  variables  to varying degrees; however, the nature of the variables may be different.  Irregular adversaries are organized in a fundamentally different way than states, and they manifest themselves in completely different ways.  The utility of the PMESII-PT construct for irregular forces is still valid.    For  deterrence,  the  political,  psychological,  and  economic  characteristics  of  an  OE assume  increased  importance  at  the  operational  and  tactical  levels.    For  example,  on  the political scale, if an adversary has possessed CBRNE weapons during past crises, it becomes important  to  understand  the  effect  that  the  presence  of  those  weapons  has  on  the  region's politics and on the decision to use or withhold such weapons.  It also provides vulnerability reduction  measures  by  understanding  the  enemy‘s  national  and  strategic  considerations, operational  considerations,  threats,  information,  their  infrastructure,  and  the  physical environment. 1.4.2.1.  Political.    Political  decisions  made  during  the  conduct  of  military  operations impact  the  strategic,  operational,  and  tactical  actions  that  shape  the  OE.    Planners  and combatant  command  (COCOM)  staffs  must  understand  the  political  environment  of nation states or non-state actors to  determine how it could  affect  the  OE.  Planners  and   8  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 commanders  should  conduct  an  analysis  of  the  adversary‘s  strategic  capabilities.    It  is vital to understand the adversary‘s motivations and values in order to be able to estimate the  pressure  it  might  feel  to  use,  or  withhold,  CBRN  weapons  in  a  particular  situation.  Political,  psychological,  and  economic  considerations  that  influence  deterrence  may  be the  dominant  factors  influencing  the  adversary‘s  courses  of  action.    At  this  level,  the analysis of the adversary‘s strategic capabilities will concentrate on  considerations such as the psychology of political leadership, national will and morale, ability of the economy to sustain warfare, possible willingness to use CBRN weapons, and possible intervention by  third-party  countries  and  non-state  groups.    Consider  other  factors  such  as  treaties, international law, and moral or religious issues with the enemy using CBRN weapons. 1.4.2.2.  Military.  The military variable includes aspects of the OE such as armed forces, security forces (SF), insurgent groups, paramilitary organizations, and criminal groups.  It includes an analysis of how the effects of a CBRNE environment will impact personnel, mission  operations,  weapons  systems,  and  the  installations.    Commanders  must  analyze the  enemies‘  weapon  systems  to  determine  their  accuracy,  the  likely  means  of  delivery for attacks involving CBRNE materials, the ranges of the weapon systems, and the likely enemy firing protocol (number of munitions and separation time between weapons).  In addition, commanders must assess the suitability and effectiveness of the protection and detection equipment the installation possesses, to include the capability of active defense systems (such as the Patriot anti-aircraft/missile system) to intercept and destroy enemy weapon systems. 1.4.2.3.  Economic.    The  economic  variable  looks  at  the  formal  economy,  including production,  distribution,  consumption,  labor  force,  and  trade.    While  this  is  not  an installation  or  MAJCOM  responsibility,  an  analysis  of  the  enemy‘s  economy  provides insight into their ability to sustain a war, to produce CBRNE weapons, and if their trade partners might become involved in the war if trade is cut off. 1.4.2.4.  Social.    When  evaluating  the  social  variable  in  the  OE,  commanders  and planners should look at these areas: What is the social structure of the people operating or living  in  the  area  of  operations?    What  are  their  religious  beliefs  and  sensitivities  the commander and the forces operating in the area need to be aware?  Does the enemy have allies  that  might  enhance  their  capabilities?    Do  they  have  a  history  of  using  CBRNE weapons?    What  are  the  known  attitudes  of  the  population  to  the  government  and/or ruling force?  Is the population accustomed to local warfare and civilian casualties?  Has the enemy shown a willingness to knowingly endanger the resident populace?   The information  variable  evaluates intelligence,  media 1.4.2.5.  Information. information,  and  other  sources  to  provide  details  on  the  status  of  enemy  and  friendly forces.  This helps produce a common operating picture of the OE.  Accurate and timely intelligence information provides commanders with situational awareness of the enemy‘s capabilities to use and sustain CBRNE weapons attacks. 1.4.2.6.  Infrastructure.  The infrastructure variable is more than the collection of physical assets.    Planners  have  to  evaluate  the  likelihood  and  impact  of  potential  hazardous releases  from  local  activities  or  industries  such  as  pipelines,  storage,  or  shipping facilities.    What  is  the  civil  response  capability  of  hospitals,  clinics,  and  other  medical treatment facilities to handle patients from a CBRNE incident?  Are there water sources AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   9  available  that  can  be  used  for  decontamination  purposes?    The  infrastructure  must  be evaluated on what is available for friendly forces as well as enemy forces.  For example, if  an  enemy  has  underground,  hardened  chemical-biological  storage  and  missile  launch facilities,  it  is  possible  that  those  assets  will  be  able  to  survive  initial  U.S.  attacks  and present a longer-term threat. 1.4.2.7.  Physical  Environment.    The  physical  environment  includes  weather,  terrain, geography,  and  manmade  structures  within  the  operational  area.    Weather  and  terrain must be well understood in  the operational  area to determine the optimal timing for the enemy‘s  use  of  CBRN  weapons  against  an  installation.    Note  that  the  enemy  can  use CBRN  weapons  at  any  time  but  that  the  adverse  impact  will  be  greater  under  some circumstances  than  others.    Planners  can  use  this  physical  environment  information  to assess  and  predict  the  effects  of  CBRN  weapons  using  modeling  and  predictive  tools.  Refer to Air Force Tactic, Technique, and Procedure (AFTTP) (I) 3-2.56, Multi-Service Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and Nuclear  Contamination  Avoidance,  and  AFTTP(I)  3-2.46,  Multi-Service  Tactics, Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Nuclear,  Biological,  and  Chemical  (NBC)  Protection, regarding  the effects of the physical environment on CBRN materials. 1.5.  Policy Overview.  The goal of United States policy is to help create a world of democratic, well-governed states that can meet the needs of their citizens and conduct themselves responsibly in  the  international  system.    The  United  States  must  champion  aspirations  for  human  dignity, strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism, work with others to defuse regional conflicts, and prevent our enemies from threatening and/or using WMD.  Our defense and military strategy is based on this strategic policy. 1.5.1.  National Strategy.  It is the policy of the United States to seek and support democratic movements  and  institutions  in  every  nation  and  culture,  with  the  ultimate  goal  of  ending tyranny  in  our  world.    In  the  world  today,  the  fundamental  character  of  regimes  matters  as much as the distribution of power among them.  The goal of our statecraft is to help create a world  of  democratic,  well-governed  states  that  can  meet  the  needs  of  their  citizens  and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system.  This is the best way to provide enduring security for the American people. 1.5.1.1.  Countering  the  spread  of  biological  weapons  requires  a  strategy  focused  on improving  capacity  to  detect  and  respond  to  biological  attacks,  securing  dangerous pathogens, and limiting the spread of materials useful for biological weapons. 1.5.1.2.  To  defend  against  chemical  weapon  threats,  the  US  Government  is  working  to improve detection and other chemical defense capabilities at home and abroad, including ensuring that US  military  forces and emergency  responders are trained and equipped to manage the consequences of a chemical weapons attack. 1.5.2.  The  National  Defense  Strategy.    The  NDS  supports  the  National  Security  Strategy (NSS)  by  establishing  a  set  of  overarching  defense  objectives  that  guide  the  Department‘s security  activities  and  provide  direction  for  the  National  Military  Strategy.    The  NDS objectives serve as links between military activities and those of other government agencies in  pursuit  of  national  goals.    The  Department  must  take  action  to  secure  the  United  States from direct attack and counter, at a safe distance, those who seek to harm the country.  The Department must work to secure strategic access to key regions, lines of communication and   10  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 the  ―global  commons‖  of  international  waters,  airspace,  space  and  cyberspace.    Defense activities  must  help  establish  security  conditions  favorable  to  the  United  States  and  its partners while working to expand the community of like-minded nations.  The NDS supports the NSS and provides the framework on which the U.S will achieve enduring security.  The following  five  key  objectives  for  implementing  the  strategy  include:  defend  the  homeland; win  the  long  war;  promote  security;  deter  conflict;  and  win  our  nation‘s  wars.    These objectives  will  structure  strategic  planning  and  decision-making  across  all  segments  of  the Department. 1.5.3.  National Military Strategy.  The National Military Strategy (NMS) supports the aims of  the  NSS  and  implements  the  National  Defense  Strategy  (NDS).    It  describes  the  Armed Forces‘  plan  to  achieve  military  objectives  in  the  near  term  and  provides  the  vision  for ensuring they remain decisive in the future.  The NMS establishes three supporting military objectives:  to  protect  the  United  States  against  external  attacks  and  aggression;  prevent conflict and surprise attack; and prevail against adversaries. 1.5.3.1.  Protect the United States against external attacks.  Joint forces help to secure the United  States  from  direct  attack  through  military  activities  overseas,  planning  and execution of homeland defense and support to civil authorities.  Our experience in long-term  and  extended  conflicts  reinforces  the  fact  that  protecting  the  Nation  and  its  global interests  requires  more  than  passive  defensive  measures.    The  threats  posed  by  terrorist groups  and  rogue  states,  especially  those  that  gain  access  to  Weapons  of  Mass Destruction  Effect,  mandate  an  active  defense-in-depth.    Achieving  this  objective requires  actions  to  counter  threats  overseas  and  close  to  their  source;  to  secure  our  air, sea,  space  and  land  territorial  approaches;  and  at  home  to  defend  against  direct  attacks.  When directed, the Armed Forces provide military support to civil authorities, including capabilities to manage the consequences of an attack. 1.5.3.2.  Prevent  conflict  and  surprise  attacks.    Preventing  conflict  and  deterring aggression  rely  in  large  part  on  an  integrated  overseas  presence.    Overseas,  US  forces permanently  based  in  strategically  important  areas,  rotationally  deployed  forward  in support of regional objectives, and temporarily deployed during contingencies, convey a credible message that the United States remains committed to preventing conflict.  These forces  also  clearly  demonstrate  that  the  United  States  will  react  forcefully  should  an adversary threaten the United States, its interests, allies and partners.  The United States must  remain  vigilant  in  identifying  conditions  that  can  lead  to  conflict  in  anticipating adversary  actions  and  in  reacting  more  swiftly  than  in  the  past.    The  Joint  Force  will deploy forward with a purpose – on the ground, in the air, in space and at sea – and work with  other nations to  promote security and to  deter aggression.  Preventing conflict and surprise  attacks  requires  that  the  Armed  Forces  take  action  to  ensure  strategic  access, establish favorable security conditions and work to increase the capabilities of partners to protect common security interests. 1.5.3.3.  Prevail  against  adversaries.   Developments  in  the  security  environment necessitate a Joint Force that can achieve tactical and operational success and prevail in a manner  that  establishes  favorable  security  conditions  and  ensures  enduring  victories.  Terrorist attacks demonstrate that modern conflicts are not limited to intra-state and local conflict.    Incidents of international  terrorism demonstrate the increasing  global reach of militant  organizations.    The  United  States  will  constantly  strive  to  enlist  the  support  of AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   11  the  international  community  and  increase  the  capabilities  of  partners  to  contend  with common challenges, but will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary. 1.5.3.4.  The  United  States  faces  a  number  of  dangerous  and  pervasive  threats.  Conventional,  irregular,  catastrophic,  and  disruptive  challenges  will  require  the  Armed Forces to adjust quickly and decisively to change and anticipate emerging threats.  Three key  aspects  of  the  security  environment  have  unique  implications  for  executing  this military strategy and will drive the development of concepts and capabilities that ensure success in future operations. Table 1.1.  Maturing and Emerging Challenges Conventional Irregular Catastrophic Disruptive Challenges are posed by states employing recognized military capabilities and forces in well-understood forms of military competition and conflict. Challenges come from those employing ―unconventional‖ methods to counter the conventional advantages of stronger opponents. Challenges involve the acquisition, possession, and use of WMD or methods producing WMD-like effects. Challenges may come from adversaries who develop and use breakthrough technologies to negate current U.S. advantages in key operational domains. 1.5.4.  US Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Warfare Defense Policy.  The Armed Forces of the United States must be prepared to  conduct  prompt, sustained and decisive combat operations in CBRN environments.  An adversary‘s CBRN capabilities can have a profound impact on US and multinational objectives, campaign plans, and supporting actions, and therefore must be taken into account in planning.  A fundamental premise of US military  preparedness  is  that  adversaries  are  most  likely  to  be  deterred  from  provocative action  when  US  forces  are  sufficiently  and  visibly  organized,  trained  and  equipped  to overcome  the  effects  of  their  weapon  systems.    Deterring  an  adversary‘s  use  of  CBRN weapons depends to a significant degree on effective preparations by the defender to deny the adversary any meaningful advantage from the employment of such weapons.  Commanders must include the unique CBRN aspects in the intelligence preparation of the OE, take action to  reduce  force  vulnerability  to  CBRN  attack  and  provide  for  protection  of  the  force commensurate with mission accomplishment.  Commanders are responsible for maintenance of  the  health  of  their  commands  to  assure  mission  accomplishment  in  the  event  of  CBRN attacks. 1.5.5.  Combating  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction.    The  National  Strategy  to  Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction (NS-CWMD) guides all US Government activities to combat WMD.    It  states  that  chemical,  biological,  nuclear  and  radiological  weapons,  in  the possession  of  hostile  states  and  terrorists,  represent  one  of  the  greatest  security  challenges facing  the  United  States  and  that  we  must  pursue  a  comprehensive  strategy  to  counter  this threat  in  all  of  its  dimensions.    The  NS-CWMD  has  three  principal  pillars:  counter-proliferation  to  combat  WMD  use,  strengthened  nonproliferation  to  combat  WMD proliferation,  and consequence management  to  respond to WMD use.  These pillars  form  a common framework for the interagency conduct of CWMD activities and provide a strategic foundation  for  military  operations.    These  three  pillars  are  further  expanded  upon  in classified annexes to the NS CWMD, as well as in the National Military Strategy to Combat   12  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 WMD,  as  there  are  eight  discrete  military  mission  areas,  including  passive  defense  and consequence management. 1.5.5.1.  CWMD  requires  a  long-term,  strategic  campaign  approach  and  places  heavy emphasis  on  interagency  support  and  coordination.    CWMD  involves  execution  of  a broad global strategy where DOD is often not the lead agency, and military programs and activities  must  be  integrated  with  a  larger  US  Government  effort.    Commanders  must think  long  term  and  collaborate  with  interagency  and  multinational  partners.    For combatant  commanders  (CCDRs),  CWMD  operations  must  be  integrated  into  theater campaign  plans,  particularly  security  cooperation  and  partnership  activities,  with  the realization  that  these  actions  will  produce  few  immediate  results.    CCDRs‘  efforts  will consist  of  a  wide  variety  of  CWMD  actions  across  discrete  lines  of  operations  being executed  in  conjunction  with  other  US  Government  efforts  and  the  theater  campaign strategy.    Thus,  CWMD  can  be  envisioned  as  part  of  grand  strategy  –  a  continuous campaign  fought  by  DOD  in  concert  with  interagency  partners  and  in  cooperation  with multinational partners.  The two pillars that affect the guidance in this publication are the counter-proliferation  and  the  consequence  management  pillars.    Within  AF  doctrine, these two pillars fall under the AF Counter-CBRN Operations.  The threat or occurrence of  a  CBRNE  event  is  a  catalyst  for  initiating  passive  defense  and/or  consequence management actions.  Each may be used in conjunction with the other to balance mission continuation  with  force  survivability,  which  in  turn  maximizes  mission  effectiveness within a CBRNE environment. 1.5.5.2.  Passive Defense.  Passive defense measures are designed to protect US and host nation (HN) installations and facilities, interests, points of embarkation and debarkation, critical  infrastructure,  equipment,  and  personnel  from  CBRNE  effects.    Passive  defense measures will enable sustained air and ground combat and combat support operations in a CBRNE environment.  CBRNE passive defense includes measures to minimize or negate the vulnerability to, and minimize effects of CBRNE use against US and allied forces, as well  as  US  military  interests,  installations,  and  critical  infrastructure.    Activities associated  with  passive  defense  include  preparation  and  planning  for  operations  in  a CBRNE environment.  Success depends on the effective integration of equipment, trained personnel, and proven TTPs. 1.5.5.3.  Consequence Management.  Consequence management (CM) activities serve to reduce the effects  of a CBRNE attack or event,  and assist  in the restoration of essential operations and services at home and abroad in a permissive environment.  CM includes actions  taken  to  prepare  for,  respond  to  and  mitigate  the  effects  of  a  CBRNE  attack  or event  against  our  homeland,  deployed  forces  and  US  interests  abroad;  to  assist  the  US, HN and allies on an installation; and to provide military assistance to civilian authorities off  an  installation  to  restore  essential  operations  and  services.    In  non-permissive environments, DOD forces may perform consequence management measures designed to save  lives  and  to  restore  and  sustain  wartime  mission  operations.    The  purpose  of  CM operations  during  a  CBRNE  incident  is  to  control  the  incident  in  order  to  minimize  the long-term impact on an AF installation and on its ability to conduct operations.  Within CONUS, many local, State and Federal agencies will be involved.  Agreements and plans must be established and exercised fully to ensure integrated and efficient operations and communication during real-world incidents. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   13  1.5.6.  Defense Support of Civil Authorities and Foreign Consequence Management (FCM).  The  DOD  may  support  a  request  from  civil  authorities  above  already  established  mutual agreements  under  certain  conditions  and  if  the  resources  are  available.    CBRNE  foreign consequence management is assistance provided by the United States Government to a host nation  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  a  deliberate  or  inadvertent  CBRNE  attack  or  event  and restore essential government services. 1.5.6.1.  Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA), United States (US), its territories and  possessions.    The  commander‘s  inherent  authority  to  maintain  law  and  order  on  a military installation coupled with the responsibility to protect AF personnel, facilities and equipment  guides  the  response  to  any  use  of  CBRNE.    The  SecDef  is  the  approval authority  for  support  of  civil  authorities  (foreign,  federal,  state  or  local)  involving Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  responses  to  acts  of  terrorism  or  CBRNE  events.    The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has investigative jurisdiction over CBRNE attacks and  should  be  immediately  notified  when  an  incident  occurs.    The  installation  may respond  immediately  and  report  the  incident  as  soon  as  possible  if  the  effects  of  an incident on an installation extend to surrounding civilian communities or when the need to  save  lives,  prevent  human  suffering  or  mitigate  great  property  damage  is  a  concern.  This also includes when time does not allow the commander or installation leadership to obtain prior approval from Higher Headquarters in response to a direct request from civil authorities  for  assistance  to  save  lives,  prevent  human  suffering,  or  mitigate  great property  damage.    The  civil  authorities  must  submit  requests  in  writing  as  soon  as possible if the requests are verbal "immediate response" requests. 1.5.6.2.  Foreign  Consequence  Management.    A  Status-of-Forces  Agreement  (SOFA) generally  governs  response  to  terrorist  use  of  CBRNE  attacks  on  US  installations  in foreign  countries.    Most  SOFAs  require  that  military  authorities  assist  the  host  nation authority with investigations.  The Department of State (DOS) is the lead federal agency (LFA) for all FCM operations and coordinates the overall Unites States response, unless otherwise  directed  by  the  President.    The  HN  requests  US  support  through  the ambassador  or  other  designated  DOS  official.    The  HN  has  primary  responsibility  for responding  to,  managing  and  mitigating  the  effects  of  a  foreign  CBRNE  incident.    All DOD  support  to  the  HN  will  be  coordinated  by  the  responsible  chief  of  mission  and country  team,  to  include  gaining  approval  for  the  use  of  DOD  forces  from  the  SecDef.  DOD assistance does not  diminish the HN government‘s responsibilities to mitigate the effects  of  a  CBRNE  incident.    When  imminently  serious  conditions  resulting  from  any foreign emergency or attack require immediate action, military commanders may respond as may be necessary in order to save lives.  When such compelling conditions exist and time does not permit prior approval from Higher Headquarters, commanders or officials acting  under  this  ―immediate  response  authority‖  may  take  necessary  action  to  respond according to AFI 10-2501.   14  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Chapter 2 PREPAREDNESS 2.1.  Preparedness  Overview.  Preparedness begins before a conventional or irregular CBRNE attack  occurs  and  includes  planning,  equipping,  training,  and  exercising.    Developing  the installation  Comprehensive  Emergency  Management  Plan  (CEMP)  10-2  and  checklists,  and establishing  TTPs  to  respond  to  all  potentialities  are  vital  to  the  planning  segment  in  the preparedness  phase  of  incident  management.    Possessing  and  maintaining  the  necessary equipment to accomplish all assigned tasks is critical to detection, identification, protection, and recovery efforts.  Installation training is imperative to ensure personnel are prepared to respond collaboratively  to  an  event.    The  installation  CBRNE  training  program  provides  the  base populace training on CBRNE response procedures and threats.  Exercises provide the means for the installation to test their plans, TTPs, and response forces and equipment before an incident.  Figure  2.1, depicts  the  phases of incident  management  relationships  within a CBRNE incident context. Figure 2.1.  Phases of Incident Management   2.2.  Planning  -  Threat  Probability  and  the  Operational  Environment.  Installation  threat probabilities include attacks by air, ground, missile, special operations forces (SOF), or terrorists.  Depending upon the theater of operations and installation location, enemy forces could employ CBRNE weapons against multiple locations, single bases, or as part of a terrorist or SOF attack.  For  the  near  future,  the  theater  ballistic  missile  (TBM)  remains  the  dominant  CBRNE  weapon delivery system against an installation during wartime.  As many TBMs are relatively inaccurate, enemy  forces  may  choose  to  increase  the  impact  of  their  weapons  by  employing  chemical  or biological warheads.  TBMs may employ either binary, unitary, or submunitions-filled warheads.  Terrorists or SOF ground forces may conduct random installation attacks with standoff weapons against  targets  of  opportunity  such  as  aircraft  and  massed  troops.    These  forces  may  also  use standoff  weapons  or  saboteurs  to  target  specific  parts  of  the  airbase,  such  as  command  and control  (C2)  systems;  critical  utility  nodes;  petroleum,  oil,  and  lubricants  (POL)  storage  and distribution systems; and large sources of toxic industrial materials on or near the base.  Enemy AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   15  ground force weaponry within range of Air Force installations normally are limited to small arms and  conventional  explosives,  but  could  employ  small  quantities  of  CBRNE  weapons.    Figure 2.2,  below  depicts  the  likely  types  of  CBRNE  terrorist  attacks  in  terms  of  likelihood  of occurrence  and  probable  impact.    Attachment  6  provides  additional  information  on  CBRNE threats. Figure 2.2.  Probability of Threats  2.2.1.  When  developing  installation  plans,  bases  should  consider  Memorandums  of Agreement,  civilian  agency  plans,  base  installation  support  requirements,  shelters,  and evacuation  procedures.    The  development  of  checklists  and  standard  operating  procedures (SOP) must be part of this planning process to ensure the installation is able to respond to the hazards  that  threaten  the  site.    The  development  of  Continuity  of  Operations  Plans  should also take place during this phase.  Identifying and prioritizing all mission essential functions (MEFs)  performed  on  the  installation  guides  commanders  decisions  during  an  incident.  Deliberate  planning  prior  to  an  event  allows  installations  to  minimize  the  effects  of  an incident.    Refer  to  AFI  10-208,  Continuity  of  Operations  (COOP)  Program  for  more information.    EM  planning  implements  AFIMS  to  standardize  incident  management  for conventional and irregular CBRNE threats on and off base.  Standardization ensures effective communication when additional assistance is required.  Installations begin the planning phase by  completing  a  vulnerability  assessment.    Information  gathered  in  this  effort  allows installations to determine what personnel, supplies, and equipment are required for response, recovery,  and  mitigation.    Installations  must  plan  by  considering  the  worst-case  scenario along  with  the  most  probable  scenarios,  and  balance  efforts  through  operational  risk management decisions. 2.2.2.  Each  installation  must  ensure  their  emergency  operations  plans  address  the  unique planning requirements associated with conventional and irregular CBRNE attacks.  Planning may produce maps, charts, tables, checklists, resource inventories and summaries of critical information.    These  planning  products  should  be  included  as  part  of  the  installation CEMP10-2, Disease Containment Plan (DCP), or other appropriate plan. 2.2.3.  Air  Force  planners  and  subject  matter  experts  (SME)  must  use  the  probable consequences  of  representative  CBRNE  threat  profiles  as  a  basis  for  their  planning.    In Likelihood of ThreatNuclear WeaponsChemical WeaponsRadio-IsotopesContagious Biological PathogensBiological ToxinsImpact of ThreatIndustrial ChemicalsHigh-Explosives  16  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 addition, planners must consider data acquired through the Intelligence and Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) communities and the material contained in Attachment 6 of this publication.  Table 2.1, contains additional references for obtaining this information.  Specific  CBRNE  defense  planning  requirements  are  identified  and  described  in  other  AF publications.

Installation  and  Planning  Management  Structure.    To  assist  the  commander  in determining  the  right  deterrence  methods  and  resources  the  following  installation  level working  groups  are  established  to  provide  guidance:  Antiterrorism  Working  Group, Emergency  Management  Working  Group,  and  the  Threat  Working  Group  as  shown  in Figure 2.3 Figure 2.3.  Air Force Emergency Management Program Structural Relationships Installation Level Note:  This figure shows the relationship between specific working groups, rather than all working groups on an installation.  2.2.4.1.  Antiterrorism  Working  Group  (ATWG).    The  Installation  ATWG  oversees  the Antiterrorism  (AT)  program  and  is  the  force  protection  advisory  body  for  the commander.    The  ATWG  develops  AT  related  policy  for  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force approval, TTP, and guidance; clarifies AT roles and responsibilities; conducts long-range planning  and  recommends  resourcing  requirements;  and  addresses  emergent  or emergency  requirements  through  the  Combating  Terrorism  Readiness  Initiatives  Fund.  The  ATWG  recommends  to  the  commander,  through  the  Antiterrorism  Executive Committee, courses of action that will help to deter or interrupt a terrorist attack prior to or during the course of a terrorist attack.  See AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism (AT) for more information on the ATWG. 2.2.4.2.  Emergency  Management  Working  Group  (EMWG).    The  EMWG  coordinates on a continual basis with the Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) and ATWG.  The EMWG will  conduct  an  annual  CBRNE  Vulnerability  Assessment  (VA)  based  on  the  Threat Assessment,  and  will  provide  the  installation  commander  a  plan  to  mitigate  the vulnerabilities  within  90  days  of  the  CBRNE  VA.    See  AFI  10-2501  for  additional information on EMWG. 2.2.4.3.  Threat  Working  Group  (TWG).    The  Installation  TWG  is  an  antiterrorism  and force  protection  advisory  body  for  the  commander.    Key  functions  include  analyzing threats  and  providing  recommendations  to  commanders  concerning  potential  Force Protection  Condition  (FPCON)  changes,  AT  and  other  measures  based  upon  potential threats  to  facilities,  personnel,  equipment,  or  missions.    See  AFI  10-245  for  additional information on TWG. 2.2.5.  Integration  of  Installation  Plans.    Integration  of  installation  plans  is  essential  to effective  response  and  recovery  activities.    Installations  are  tasked  to  develop,  train  and   18  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 exercise  a  number  of  different  but  interlocking  plans,  which  if  not  integrated  to  work  in concert  with  one  another,  may  lead  to  inappropriate  decisions,  inappropriate  use  of  limited resources  and  potential  increased  risk  to  personnel.    In  order  to  be  successful  and  prevent unnecessary disruption at the time of execution, the CBRNE defense portions of installation plans  must  be  complementary.    For  example,  when  an  installation  responds  to  a  potential biological event in a CONUS environment, several installation planning documents may be called into play: CEMP 10-2, DCP, MCRP, etc.  Each of these documents may address the methods  of  individual  protection  for  a  biological  agent  hazard;  however,  the  information  is complementary.  The CEMP 10-2 identifies installation procedures for response and recovery from  conventional  or  irregular  attacks,  using  CBRNE  materials;  the  MCRP  addresses individual protection for medical personnel and patients; and the DCP provides procedures to maximize protection for base personnel before, during, and after an operationally significant naturally occurring outbreak of disease or terrorist attack involving biological materials.  The Installation  Defense  Plan  provides  procedures  in  protecting  and  defending  the  installation from an attack from ground forces, SOF or terrorists. 2.2.5.1.  Plans  should  not  be  duplicative;  cross  referencing  between  the  products  is  the desired  practice.    Installation  CBRNE  defense  planners  should  look  at  the  entire  set  of CBRNE defense segments from the various plans in overarching cross-functional review sessions  in  order  to  ensure  the  commander‘s  guidance  is  being  followed,  installation capabilities  and  response  procedures  are  accurately  portrayed,  and  all  resource  and/or procedural disconnects are resolved.  The baseline assumptions for the CBRNE defense portions of the planning documents and the results of the overarching reviews should be briefed to both the EMWG and TWG. 2.2.5.2.  OPRs  for  each  plan  must  coordinate  their  respective  plan(s)  with  all  tasked agencies within their plan, as well as the OPRs for the other installation plans that contain CBRNE defense segments.  At the time of execution in an attack recovery environment (wartime, contingency, or peacetime), the relevant portions of the respective plans will be integrated  into  the  Incident  Action  Plan  (IAP).    See  AFMAN  10-2502,  for  additional details regarding the development, coordination, and use of the IAP. 2.2.5.3.  Integration of Other Services or Nations Forces.  The CBRNE defense portion of AF plans must address units and personnel from other services and nations to the extent these  forces  are  on  the  installation,  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  installation,  or  are expected to be used in the aftermath of an attack involving CBRNE materials.  This holds true  regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  AF  element  is  the  supported  or  supporting organization.  The incorporation and integration of these forces is just as important to the success of overall installation force survivability and mission continuation. 2.2.5.3.1.  It is unlikely that the forces from other services or nations will be familiar with  all  AF  terms  and  procedures  across  the  full  CBRNE  response  spectrum.    As  a result, if the AF is the supporting organization, it is incumbent upon the Emergency Operations  Center  (EOC)  and  appropriate  Emergency  Support  Function  (ESF) representatives to ensure that the supported personnel are fully aware of the terms and procedures that will be used, as well as any specific responsibilities the unit will have in support of the overall installation CBRNE defense posture.  It is equally important, if  the  AF  is  the  supported  unit,  that  the  AF  equivalent  of  the  EOC  or  unit  control center  and  appropriate  ESF  representatives  learn  and  distribute  the  host  terms  and AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   19  procedures.    Table  2.3,  provides  a  representative  listing  of  some  of  the  anticipated disconnects that exist between AF personnel and other services or nations in regards to CBRNE defense operations. Table 2.3.  Potential CBRNE Defense-Related Disconnects Between Air Force Units And Other Services Or Nations Alarm Signals (AF uses Alarm Green; others do not). AF uses alpha designators to report description of unexploded ordnance; others do not. AF does not use formal decontamination teams in the aftermath of enemy state chemical, biological, or nuclear attacks; others may employ these resources. Release of People after Enemy Missile Attack (in recognition of effect of chemical droplet fall phase - AF uses Alarm Black Initial/Limited/General Release; others do not). Army/Marines have each unit responsible for their own perimeter security; AF generally does not. AF places M8 paper around facilities; others do not necessarily do so AF CCA procedures differ from Army Detailed Personnel Decontamination procedures and Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) Gear Exchange procedures. AF uniformly uses Split MOPP/transition points; others do not necessarily do so. Handling of contaminated resources (AF uses specific procedures; others do not). 2.2.5.3.2.  AF  CBRNE  defense  planners  must  make  every  effort  to  resolve  these issues.  In addition to the just-in-time training component that may be required for the respective differences, AF units should recommend the use of a liaison  officer from the  tenant  unit  in  the  EOC  to  assist  the  communications  and  desired  response activities.    In  instances  where  the  AF  is  the  tenant  unit,  the  AF  leadership  should strongly consider placing a liaison officer in the EOC equivalent location of the other service or nation. 2.2.6.  Assessment  Process.   AFTTP  3-2.70,  Multiservice  Tactics,  Techniques,  and Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological  and  Nuclear,  Aspects  of  Command  and Control,  provides  guidance  regarding  the  vulnerability  assessment  (VA)  process.    While AFTTP 3-2.70 does not specifically address vulnerability reduction measures for high-yield explosives, the process for accomplishing the VA is applicable.  The CBRNE VA process is a  continuous  cycle  of  four  functions:  threat  analysis-  identify  threats,  vulnerability assessment  –  assess  friendly  capabilities  and  limitations,  vulnerability  analysis  –  analyze threat  and  friendly  capability,  and  vulnerability  reduction  measures.    The  concept  of operational  risk  management  (ORM)  is  used  when  deciding  which  vulnerability  reduction measures to pursue.  Figure 2.4., depicts the vulnerability assessment process. 2.2.6.1.  The  commander  establishes  and  implements  a  deliberate  process  for  assessing and  mitigating  the  vulnerability  of  manpower,  facilities,  operational  missions,  and materiel  to  a  CBRNE  attack.    This  process  will  integrate  all  capabilities  to  reduce  the threat  of  CBRNE  use  and  sustain  operations  if  attacks  occur.    The  process  will  also   20  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 include implementing mitigation and restoration plans to reduce the operational impact of CBRN contamination and other toxic hazards.

CBRNE threat analysis is a continual process of compiling and examining  all  available  threat  information  in  order  to  identify  and  analyze  the  likely CBRNE  threat  profiles  the  installation  faces  from  both  enemy  nations  and  terrorist organizations.    Commanders  identify  and  analyze  the  most  likely  threats  for  both  in-garrison  and deployed locations, and tailor their forces to  conduct  operations to  counter them.    This  assessment  is  used  for  deliberate  and  execution  planning,  exercise  scenario development and evaluation, and installation VA.  See paragraph 1.4.2, PMESII-PT for information to consider during the threat analysis. 2.2.6.2.1.  Worldwide CBRNE Threat Assessment.  AFI 10-2501, identifies threats by geographical  location  as  provided  by  the  major  commands.    This  assessment  of postulated  threats  enables  commanders  to  identify  minimum  standards  to  train, organize, equip, and protect forces.  Airbases within these geographical locations are categorized as CBRNE high, medium, or low threat areas.  This assessment uses open source  publications,  MAJCOM  and  theater  guidance,  and  unclassified  intelligence information  available  at  the  time  of  publication.    In  a  related  area,  AFI  31-101, outlines  three  installation  attack  threat  levels  that  installations  may  face.    AF personnel and units must be capable of reacting to CBRNE attacks at all threat levels, which  range  from  independently-initiated  terrorist  activities  to  major  attacks  by aircraft and ballistic missiles. 2.2.6.2.2.  The  installation  TWG  is  tasked  to  develop  the  threat  analysis  using guidelines  in  this  publication,  AFI  10-245,  and  AFTTP  3-2.70.    As  a  minimum, commanders  must  use  the  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  Warfare Capstone  Threat  Assessment  05-0909-027,  http://www.dia.smil.mil.  in  determining local CB threats.  The analysis incorporates current intelligence and force protection information  from  theater,  MAJCOM,  and  Joint  Task  Force  Headquarters.    It  also includes  input  from  local  intelligence,  AFOSI,  security  forces,  civil  engineer,  and AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   21  medical  organizations.    The  AF  recognizes  that  the  specific  nature  of  the  threat  is seldom static. 2.2.6.3.  Threats. 2.2.6.3.1.  In  contingency  environments  where  terrorists  or  enemy  sympathizers  are involved, AF installations will face a number of potential CBRNE weapon systems, to  include  Improvised  Explosive  Devices  (IED).    Figure  2.5,  depicts  the  increased use  and  impact  that  IEDs  have  had  on  American  casualty  figures  in  the  Iraq  war.  Table  2.4,  provides  background  information  regarding  approximate  fragmentation distances  of  military  ordnance  that  AF  personnel  may  encounter.    Additionally, Attachment  5,  Figure  A5.10,  Recommended  Improvised  Explosive  Device  (IED) Minimum  Evacuation  Distance  (MED),  provides  MED  based  upon  the  type  of military ordnance or size of an IED.  Contact the installation AFOSI and intelligence representatives for additional information regarding which specific threat systems are likely  to  be  used  in  the  local  area.    Contact  the  installation  Explosive  Ordnance Disposal  (EOD)  Flight,  Bioenvironmental  Engineering  (BE)  Office,  and  the Readiness  and  Emergency  Management  (EM)  Flight  for  additional  information regarding  the  potential  effects  that  could  result  from  attacks  using  these  weapons.  See  Attachment  6  for  information  regarding  additional  irregular  weapons  and delivery mechanisms that AF installations may be challenged with (e.g., radiological dispersal devices (RDD), radiological exposure devices (RED), etc). Figure 2.5.  Increased Use and Impact of IEDs on American Casualty Figures in Iraq War (2003 – 2007)  2.2.6.3.2.  Theater  missile  attacks  are  the  primary  CBRNE  threat  to  airbases  in  a conventional  conflict.    Large-scale  airbase  attacks  by  aircraft  armed  with  CBRNE weapons  are  unlikely,  unless  air  dominance  is  lost.    If  attacking  aircraft  reach  the airbase,  they  would  most  likely  use  high-yield  explosive  weapons  and  attack  large, highly valued and visible targets  such as  airfield surfaces, troop concentrations, tent cities,  tactical  and  cargo  aircraft  in  open  areas,  POL  storage  tanks,  and  visible  C2 structures. 2.2.6.3.3.  Personnel  accomplishing  the  threat  analysis  must  consider  all  aspects  of the  issue  in  order  for  the  assessment  to  be  complete.    For  example,  the  fact  that  an enemy  state  possesses  missile  systems  that  can  reach  the  installation  and  carry chemical  agents does not provide enough detail to develop the best planning factors possible.  In regards to targets, it is highly unlikely that a single AF installation will be the only target for the enemy missiles.  Consequently, the number of missiles per   22  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 attack and frequency of attacks will be affected by the number of locations the enemy is trying to disrupt and/or destroy.  Planners must research the theater-level operations plan for the conflict; in some cases, these documents contain projected enemy orders of battle that will provide installations with valuable insight. Table 2.4.  Approximate High-Explosive Fragmentation Distances Item Hand grenade 60 mm mortar 82 mm mortar 120 mm mortar 122 mm rocket Vehicle borne IED, 50 pounds Vehicle borne IED, 500 pounds Vehicle borne IED, 1000 pounds Vehicle borne IED, 4000 pounds Approximate Fragmentation Distance  Maximum Fragmentation Distance 243 ft (74 m) 305 ft (93 m) 337 ft (103 m) 431 ft (131 m) 472 ft (144 m) 600 ft (183 m) 875 ft (267 m) 981 ft (300 m) 1231 ft (376 m)      4,970 ft (1,516 m) 6,273 ft (1,913 m) 6,665 (2,031 m) 7,450 ft (2,270 m) 2.2.6.3.4.  There are several other factors that should be evaluated as part of the threat analysis in addition to the number of missiles that may be involved in an attack.  The circular error probable (CEP) of the missiles, the existence of defensive systems such as  the  Patriot,  and  the  mechanisms  for  air  burst  versus  ground  burst  release  of  the missiles must be considered.  For  example, personnel  conducting the threat  analysis would determine the approximate quantity of missiles that would be targeted against the installation in any one attack.  The next step is to determine the accuracy or CEP of the threat missile systems.  Use the Probability of Missile Impact in Main Area of Installation Table in Attachment  6 to provide an estimate of the number of missiles that would impact in the main work area of an undefended installation. 2.2.6.3.5.  If  the  installation  lacks  aerial  defense,  then  the  people  accomplishing  the threat analysis can move onto the next step.  However, if the installation is defended with a Patriot system with PAC-3 warhead for instance, the next step is to determine how many of the missiles that are anticipated to hit the installation are likely to ―leak‖ through the missile defense system.  See the installation intelligence representative or air defense liaison officer for this information since the answer will be classified. 2.2.6.3.6.  The next step in the threat analysis is to make an assessment of the airburst capacity  of  the  missile  system.    If  the  missile  is  capable  of  accurate  air  burst dissemination  of  a  chemical  agent,  then  the  chemical  droplet  fall  phase  must  be considered  as  a  major  planning  factor.    If  the  missiles  do  not  possess  an  airburst capacity,  then  the  installation  has  more  operational  response  flexibility  because  the chemical droplets will likely settle to the ground within three minutes as opposed to taking up to an hour. 2.2.6.3.7.  The  final  step  in  this  segment  of  the  threat  analysis  is  to  produce  hazard plumes  for  planning  purposes  that  represent  the  likely  post-attack  environment  in regards to agent, weather, and airburst/ground burst dimensions.  See  Attachment  6 AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   23  for  information  regarding  likely  hazard  profiles  from  CBRN  weapons  expected  in conventional conflicts. 2.2.6.3.8.  The AF has made significant CBRN defense capability improvements over the last ten years.  Developments throughout the world indicate an increased need for vigilance  and  emphasis  on  CBRN  defense.    Many  of  the  countries  engaged  in offensive CBRN programs combine their efforts with theater missile and Unmanned Aerial  Vehicle  (UAV)  programs.    UAVs  are  ideally  suited  for  the  delivery  of chemical or biological weapons given the UAVs‘ ability to disseminate aerosols.  The primary  concern  for  adversary  use  of  UAVs  with  chemical  or  biological dissemination  capability  has  been  nation-states.    There  is  a  potential  for  terrorist groups to produce or acquire small UAVs and use them as delivery vehicles. 2.2.6.3.9.  Toxic  Industrial  Material  Threats.    There  is  a  growing  concern  that  the wide  availability  of  many  Toxic  Industrial  Materials  (TIMs)  makes  them  potential tools  for  asymmetric  attacks  against  airbases.    Hostile  forces  could  target  storage sites, such as industrial plants or treatment facilities located on or near an airbase.  A deliberate release could present a short or long term hazard at the release site and for those within the downwind plume. 2.2.6.3.10.  Installations  are  under  threat  from  irregular  forces  such  as  terrorists, militia,  or  special  operations  forces.    These  forces  can  deliver  IEDs,  biological warfare  agents,  RDDs,  chemical  agents  or  mortars.    Most  of  these  forces  act independently  and  are  difficult  to  detect.    The  installation  may  not  know  the  attack occurred (biological agents) or where it came from.  In addition, our forces could be vulnerable to sniper attacks and plans must address this issue. 2.2.6.3.11.  Mass artillery  or rocket  attacks on an installation are unlikely  unless the ground  situation  changes  and  the  installation  comes  within  range  of  conventional artillery  or  multiple  rocket  launcher  (MRL)  forces.    If  this  happens,  because  of  the physical  damage  to  facilities,  aircraft,  and  aircraft  operating  surfaces  that  can  occur from significant amounts of enemy artillery or MRL systems, it will be very difficult even impossible--to conduct effective installation operations. 2.2.6.4.  Vulnerability  Analysis.    Vulnerability  analysis  is  a  continual  process  of compiling  and  examining  information  on  the  CBRNE  protective  posture  of  an installation.    The  process  assesses  the  ability  of  the  installation  to  protect  itself  and respond to CBRNE events, and the vulnerability of critical assets and infrastructure to the anticipated  threat.    It  is  imperative  the  installation  establish  what  the  projected operational  mission  requirements  are,  or  will  be,  for  both  home  station  and  deployed environments.    For  instance,  the  installation  should  determine  where  and  how  sortie generation  and  other  maintenance  processes  would  be  accomplished  and  the  resulting vulnerabilities  to  mission  degradation  in  a  CBRNE  environment.    AFTTP  3-2.70, provides  detailed  guidelines  installations  should  use  during  this  process.    Installation personnel  should  be  very  thorough,  critical,  and  skeptical  of  stated  installation capabilities  during   Table  2.5.,  provides representatives  samples  of  CBRNE  vulnerabilities  that  may  exist  in  home  station  and deployed environments. the  overall  vulnerability  assessment.   24  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 2.2.6.4.1.  Vulnerability  Reduction  Measures.    Once  specific  vulnerabilities  are identified,  the  installation  will  develop  vulnerability  reduction  measures  to  mitigate the  impact.    The  end  states  of  this  segment  of  the  process  are  the  coordinated recommendations  to  the  commander  on  CBRNE  related  vulnerability  reduction measures  from  the  Threat  Working  Group,  Antiterrorism  Working  Group,  and Emergency Management Working Group.  Refer to  Attachment  8 for related Force Protection CBRN measures. Table 2.5.  Representative CBRNE Vulnerabilities ENVIRONMENT SITUATION Home Station (peacetime) Deployed (contingency) Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) (C-bags) is centrally stored on the installation; masks and training suits are returned to centralized storage after training sessions and/or exercises. Installation may not develop a Disease Containment Plan in the same manner as existed at home station. Home Station (wartime against CBRN-capable nation state) Units do not possess sufficient barrier materials to execute desired contamination avoidance activities.  REPRESENTATIVE VULNERABILITY IPE, especially protective masks, are not readily available for personnel use as emergency escape assets in the aftermath of a terrorist event involving CBRN materials. The installation may not have an executable mass prophylaxis distribution plan that can be rapidly implemented upon recognition of a covert biological attack through the medical surveillance system. Degradation in mission operations because unit personnel must remain in MOPP 4 longer than they would if they had prevented the resource from becoming chemically contaminated. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   25   Table 2.6.  Representative CBRNE Vulnerability Reduction Measures ENVIRONMENT VULNERABILITY Home Station (peacetime) Deployed (contingency) Home Station (wartime against CBRN-capable nation state) Adversaries could transport radioactive sources (for use as RED or in RDD) onto installation without being detected. Installation biological detection and identification capabilities are rudimentary in nature (DOD sampling kits) and do not provide capability for producing ―actionable‖ results. Time-Phased Force Deployment Data are not fully familiar with actions that should take place prior, during and after an attack.  POTENTIAL VULNERABILITY REDUCTION MEASURE Use radiation detection instruments or dosimeters at installation access gates during increased FPCON levels. Determine feasibility of employing dry filter units (DFU) during periods of increased readiness and establish rapid sample transport protocol to nearest AF/DOD laboratory with JBAIDS/M1M (or equivalent) capability. Emergency Management personnel provide short orientation session to personnel during in-processing process (in addition to having information in local guides or standard operating procedures). 2.2.6.4.2.  The  recommendations  will  include  a  proposed  commander‘s  intent  and guidance  regarding  mission  continuation  priorities  and  degrees  of  acceptable  risk.  For  in-garrison  operations,  vulnerability  mitigation  should  be  based  on  ―without warning‖  standards.    Commanders  should  not  wait  until  warning  escalates  to  begin mitigation  measures.   It  is  recommended  that  action  be  taken  to  decrease vulnerabilities by methods such as hardening, over pressurizing facilities, or creating back-up  power  capability  on  a  full-time  basis  and/or  without  regard  to  degree  of warning  of  the  threat.    Table  2.6.,  provides  examples  of  potential  vulnerability reduction measures for specific vulnerabilities. 2.2.6.5.  Logistics  Assessment.    A  comprehensive  logistics  assessment  is  crucial  to  the success  of  the  CBRNE  planning  and  vulnerability  assessment  processes.    In  many circumstances, the ability to execute a critical task may hinge on logistics, both in terms of  the  availability  of  resources  and  the  shared  use  of  limited  assets.    For  example,  in  a chemical attack recovery scenario perpetrated by an enemy nation-state, the effectiveness of  contamination  control  area  (CCA)  ensemble  resupply  activities  does  not  depend entirely  on  the  fact  that  the  installation  may  have  7000  fully  serviceable  chemical protective ensembles.   The key in  this case is  the location of the ensembles.  Generally speaking,  the  ensembles  may  be  in  one  of  three  locations:  at  the  CCA  site,  in  the possession of the base populace personnel, or at a supply point other than the CCA.  Part of  the  logistics  assessment  of  this  resupply  activity  must  be  to  determine  how  the replacement chemical protective ensembles are acquired and transported to the CCA site.  Collecting  the  ensembles  from  the  base  populace  will  not  likely  be  accomplished  in  a rapid  manner  and  limited  tractor  trailer  availability  may  result  in  delays  in  transporting the  ensembles  from  a  centralized  site  to  the  CCA.    In  either  event,  the  delay  in  getting replacement  ensembles  to  the  CCA  will  result  in  either  delays  in  the  initiation  of   26  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 personnel  processing  or  a  situation  in  which  personnel  who  have  completed  CCA processing are vulnerable for a period. 2.2.6.5.1.  In order to produce credible results, logistics assessments must thoroughly examine  the  implied  or  stated  assumptions  that  plans  and  vulnerability  assessments contain.    For  example,  an  installation‘s  DCP  may  state  that  limited  medical prophylaxis  supplies  will  be  resupplied  in  a  timely  manner  by  stocks  from  the Military  Vaccine  Agency  or  the  Strategic  National  Stockpile  (SNS).    Further examination during the logistics assessment may uncover the fact that the installation has to request supplies from the SNS in conjunction with the local civil community, but  that  the  installation  has  never  discussed  the  issue  with  the  local  authorities.  Further,  the  logistics  assessment  may  reveal  that  an  agreement  with  the  civil community  has  not  been  reached  regarding  who  is  responsible  for  accounting  for different  portions  of  the  population  (e.g.,  dependants  who  live  off  base),  and integrated  plans  have  not  been  made  regarding  the  division  and  distribution  of  the supplies  once  the  bulk  packages  are  received  by  the  local  civil  community.  Consequently, the ability of the installation to acquire and distribute needed medical prophylaxis  may  be  unduly  optimistic  and  additional  work  in  this  area  would  be required. 2.2.6.5.2.  The  logistics  assessment  should  also  examine  whether  or  not  valuable resources are available on the installation or are rapidly available in the local area but unnecessary  operational  or  human  health  risks  are  being  taken  because  these resources  are  not  being  used  in  existing  installation  response  plans.    For  instance, planners must account for all CBRN equipment that will be needed and available; to include  those  assets  used  by  bioenvironmental  engineers,  fire  emergency  services, and security forces.  All functions with a UTC tasking and having a CBRN equipment requirement,  must  either  posture  the  equipment  on  their  UTC  or  identify  the requirement to Emergency Management.  CBRN planners must account for areas that would  require  CBRN  equipment  such  as  shelters,  alternate  COOP  locations,  CCAs, and  logistics  for  detecting  contamination  on  cargo.    In  addition,  planners  must  take into  account  war  reserve  materials  (WRM)  that  could  be  used  during  an  incident.  Assets in WRM status can and should be used during the different phases of incident management.    IAW  AFI  25-101,  War  Reserve  Materiel  (WRM)  Program  Guidance and Procedures, WRM assets can be used to support domestic incidents, but approval will be obtained from the WRM releasing authority.  Do not delay the use of WRM assets as necessary during actual CBRN events, but notify the approving authority as soon as possible. 2.2.6.5.3.  The  logistics  assessment  must  also  evaluate  the  sustainability  of  the projected  CBRNE  operations.    Installations  must  sustain  response,  recovery,  and critical  mission  operations  in  the  aftermath  of  attacks  involving  CBRNE  materials.  Planning  must  include  acquisition,  storage,  and  resupply  for  initial  issue  and consumable items (e.g., IPE/PPE and associated spare parts, barrier material, boot and glove troughs,  and  decontamination  kits  such  as  M295  or  Reactive  Skin Decontamination  Lotion  (RSDL),  CCA  assets,  medical  prophylaxis,  etc).    Many  of these  assets  may  be  available  on  the  local  economy,  while  others  may  be  obtained through  stockpiling  or  reach-back  capabilities;  whatever  the  means,  it  must  be AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   27  expedient and reliable.  As part of this portion of the logistics assessment, ensure the CBRN resupply expectations and requirements are included in the appropriate mutual aid  agreements  with  local  civilian  communities.    It  is  imperative  that  installations understand  if  they  are  expected  to  provide  CBRN  resupply  items  to  local  first responders  or  if  they  are  to  bring  their  own  CBRN  resupply  items  should  they  be supporting a local community through a DSCA operation. 2.2.6.6.  Risk Management.  Military CBRNE defense operations involve the acceptance of risk.   Leaders weigh  risks against the benefits from  an operation.  The commander‘s judgment balances the requirement for mission success with the inherent risks of military operations.  An installation commander‘s implementation of split MOPP operations and adherence  to  the  rules  of  handling  chemically  contaminated  resources  are  examples  of risk management.  The establishment  of Operational  Exposure Guidelines (OEG) in  the aftermath  of  an  RED  or  RDD  event,  and  the  decision  on  when  to  initiate  medical treatment based on initial results from medical surveillance reports, are examples of risk management  decisions  made  in  the  aftermath  of  irregular  warfare  activities  involving radiological or biological materials. 2.2.7.  Split MOPP.  The split MOPP technique recognizes that it is very unlikely that CBRN contamination  will  cover  the  entire  installation  in  the  aftermath  of  an  enemy  state  attack.  Rather, there will be pockets or swaths of contamination; there will also be large areas of the airbase that are uncontaminated.  Effective split MOPP operations require an assured, base-wide  communications  system,  a  well-trained  base  population  (AF,  sister  Service,  coalition forces  and  contractor  personnel)  and  command  and  control  element,  and  senior  leadership that understands the limitations, as well as the opportunities provided by this technique.  All of  these  requirements  should  exist  insofar  as  Air  Force  installations  and  personnel  are concerned, as an effective communications system is required for all operations, and the split MOPP technique is covered in formal training and exercises for all affected personnel.  Sister Service  and  coalition  forces  are  trained  in  split  MOPP  operations  through  their  education programs or through efforts embedded within normal host-tenant responsibilities.  The use of split  MOPP  operations  does  not  mean  the  installation  will  not  be  able  to  react  to  unlikely situations,  rather  the  technique  ensures  that  airbases  are  able  to  protect  their  personnel  and maximize  mission  operations  when  the  most  likely  hazard  profiles  are  encountered.    In  the unlikely event that CBRN contamination does cover the entire installation, the Crisis Action Team  (CAT)  and  the  Emergency  Operations  Center  (EOC)  will  declare  the  appropriate MOPP level for all CBRN zones (MOPP 4 for chemical attack, mask-only option for people working outside during period when radioactive fallout is settling, etc.). 2.2.7.1.  Prior  to  hostilities,  planners  identify  installation  CBRN  zones  based  on  base geography  and  mission.    The  Readiness  and  Emergency  Management  Flight  personnel should use the same sector boundaries and identification  used by the Security Forces to identify installation defense sectors if feasible.  This simplifies preparation, training, and use by the base population and EOC staff.  The objective is to develop easily discernible zone  boundaries  to  simplify  understanding  by  planners,  C2  personnel,  and  the  base populace.    Sometimes  the  use  of  the  same  sectors  used  by  the  Security  Forces  is  not feasible because only a few sectors may exist on an installation wherein the development of more CBRN zones provides greater operational  benefit in  the aftermath of an attack.  Once planners develop the CBRN zones, the installation must conduct training to ensure   28  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Unit Control Centers (UCCs) and all personnel fully understand the split MOPP process prior to actual implementation. 2.2.7.2.  Split-MOPP implementation is a sequential event.  It involves a chain of events that allows the commander the opportunity to  implement the tactic.  It  also  requires the CAT  and  EOC to  determine  mission  priorities  and  provide  course-of-action recommendations to the commander. 2.2.7.3.  Detector  limitations  may  result  in  situations  where  the  use  of  split  MOPP  may not be extremely useful in a biological environment.  Being able to accurately assess the residual  hazard  is  essential  to  establishing  and  executing  split  MOPP  in  a  manner  that supports operations and provides an appropriate level of protection for all personnel. 2.2.8.  Laboratory  Analysis  and  Shipment  Planning.    While  the  procedures  for  CBRN sampling  (planning,  collection,  preservation)  are  contained  in  other  documents,  it  is important  to  plan  for  laboratory  analysis  of  suspected  CBRN  agents.    Certified  laboratory results are required to verify a terrorist use of a non-conventional weapon, provide exposure information for hazards not identified and quantified by field instruments, or when requested by higher authority.  Samples collected due to a CBRN event likely present a greater health threat  to  all  personnel  in  the  sampling,  packaging,  transportation,  and  laboratory  analysis chain,  and  therefore,  require  increased  precautions  in  packaging  and  shipping.    These samples  could  be  used  for  criminal  investigations  and  prosecution;  therefore,  greater attention  should  be  paid  to  security  of  sample  and  chain  of  custody  procedures  and documentation.  In some circumstances, samples taken post-CBRN attack may require out of the ordinary handling by specialist personnel such as US Army Technical Escort or FBI. 2.2.8.1.  Different  hazards  have  different  criteria  for  laboratory  analysis  and  shipment requirements.    For  example,  suspected  biological  agents  must  be  sent  through  the National  Laboratory  Response  Network  (LRN).    Respectively,  nuclear  and  radiological samples  will  be  sent  (with  prior  coordination)  to  the  Air  Force  School  of  Aerospace Medicine  (USAFSAM).    At  the  tactical  unit,  preplanning  and  coordination  with  the medical  commander,  medical  laboratory,  and/or  bioenvironmental  engineering  must occur  to  determine  where  samples  will  be  shipped.    Additionally,  coordinate  with  the laboratory to ensure their awareness of your requirements, your knowledge of laboratory acceptance  protocols,  and  quickest  possible  turnaround.    Refer  to  the  International Aviation  Transportation  Association  (IATA)  for  additional  hazardous  materials (HAZMAT) shipping procedures.  The installation Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) ensures a mechanism exists at the local level to have personnel trained in IATA shipping procedures. For  guidance on transporting samples thought  to  be biological  select  agents and  toxins,  refer  to  AFI  10-3901,  Minimum  Security  Standards  for  Safeguarding Biological Select Agents and Toxins. 2.2.9.  Command and Control.  Effective C2 is a basic requirement for conducting successful military  missions  and  service  functions.    An  essential  enabler  for  a  rapid  and  effective application  of  C2  is  a  functional  organization  that  is  coherent  and  recognizable.    AFIMS provides this structure.  Further guidance can be found in AFI 10-207, Command Posts and AFMAN 10-2502. 2.2.9.1.  Commander‘s Intent.  The multitude of variables associated with CBRNE events means that multiple preparatory, response, and recovery approaches may be appropriate.  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   29  Consequently,  clear  communication  of  the  commander‘s  intent  is  crucial  throughout  all aspects  of  CBRNE  defense  operations  because  this  information  is  the  foundation  for planning and implementing protective posture actions and finalizing mission continuation priorities and associated decisions.  Table 2.7, illustrates this point through the provision of representative items that the commander‘s intent will influence. Table 2.7.  Representative Examples of Commander’s Intent regarding CBRNE Events SUBJECT Guidelines for conducting exercises. Balance point between increased protection and disruption or degradation of mission operations. Degree of acceptable risk. REPRESENTATIVE INFLUENCE OF COMMANDER’S INTENT Desired amount and length of disruption to normal operations.  Degree of allowable simulation(s).

Timing of ―release of personnel‖ decisions such as Alarm Black, General Release.  Establishment and implementation of radiological operational exposure guidelines (OEG) in aftermath of RDD incident.  Use versus avoidance of contaminated resources and areas. 2.2.9.2.  Command and Control Elements. 2.2.9.2.1.  CAT.  The CAT provides the commander of an AF installation, an Air and Space  Expeditionary  Wing  (AEW),  or  an  Air  Expeditionary  Group  (AEG)  with  a single C2 capability through which to monitor, assess, plan, and execute the full range of installation activities.  The CAT may be contained within one centralized facility or  it  may  be  a  virtual  collaborative  effort  between  the  various  C2  nodes  providing status to the CAT Director and installation commander. 2.2.9.2.2.  CAT Director.  A key  figure in  the CAT is  the CAT Director.  The CAT Director is delegated the responsibility for orchestrating the macro C2 functions in the CAT.    The  CAT  Director  is  a  conduit  for  presenting  actionable  information  to  the commanders.    This  does  not  preclude  commanders  from  receiving  and  acting  on information  relative  to  their  respective  responsibilities.    During  day-to-day  steady state operations at home station, the Chief of the Command Post normally serves as the CAT Director. 2.2.9.2.3.  Command Post.  The CP Controllers work within the CP and serve as the 24-hours per day/7 days per week (24/7) primary conduit for C2 information flow to and  from  the  installation  commander.    The  CP  serves  as  the  24/7  warm-start capability  for  the  CAT.    Some  traditional  CP  functions  will  be  consolidated  during expeditionary  operations.  The CP Controllers will closely  coordinate with the CAT Director, the Mission Director, Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), and EOC. 2.2.9.2.4.  CAT Support Staff.  The CAT Director‘s support staff is a dedicated cadre whose duties are administrative in nature.  The support staff is normally a compilation of information management personnel designated by units across the base to serve in this  capacity  during  24/7  operations  and  during  other  periods  designated  by  the installation commander.   30  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 2.2.9.2.5.  Mission Support Team.  The Mission Support Team focuses on supporting generation,  execution,  and  sustainment  of  installation  missions,  and  supervises reception,  beddown,  and  resupply  of  equipment  in  support  of  deployed  operations.  The  EOC  Director  reports  status  and  limiting  factors  (LIMFAC)  to  the  installation commander through the CAT Director.  In some instances, the EOC Director reports status  and  LIMFACs  directly  to  the  installation  commander.    Mission  Support consists  of  five  main  centers:  the  LRS,  EOC,  Emergency  Communications  Center (ECC),  the  Base  Defense  Operations  Center  (BDOC),  and  the  Air  Transportation Operations Center (ATOC). 2.2.9.2.6.  EOC.    The  EOC  Director  is  designated  by  the  installation  commander.  The  EOC  is  the  central  EM  C2  element  for  expanded  emergency  or  contingency response  operations  that  require  additional  support  beyond  the  CAT‘s  day-to-day functions: including major accidents, natural disasters, enemy attack and terrorist use of CBRNE materials.  The EOC is organized into ESFs, as defined in AFI 10-2501.  The  installation  EOC  is  designated  as  the  focal  point  for  coordination  with  civilian EOCs,  ESFs,  and  first/emergency  responders  during  a  Homeland  Security  incident, natural disaster, or other crises. 2.2.9.2.7.  The  BDOC  is  the  C2  center  for  integrated  defense  operations  during routine  and  emergency  operations.    AFTTP  3-10.2,  Integrated  Base  Defense Command and Control, is the definitive guidance regarding the BDOC.  The Defense Force Commander will establish a BDOC to coordinate and direct the tactical control of integrated defense forces and supporting capabilities.  All other names for Security Forces  control  centers  should  be  discontinued.    All  functions  performed  by  Central Security  Control,  Law  Enforcement  Desk,  or  other  Security  Forces  Control  Center (SFCC) will be performed by the BDOC, at all locations, home station and deployed.  Units protecting nuclear assets will refer to DOD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108V1, Nuclear  Weapons  Security  Manual  and  applicable  MAJCOM  supplements  for guidance on additional facility requirements. 2.2.9.2.8.  ECC.    The  ECC  is  the  single  day-to-day  emergency  response  dispatch point and includes, as a minimum, the functions of SF, Fire Alarm Communications Center  and  Medical  dispatch  (when  applicable).    ECC  operations  address  the  initial incident  notification  and  response  action  responsibilities  of  those  three  disciplinary areas.    The  ECC  is  the  centralized  24  hours,  7  days  a  week,  365  days  a  year emergency  communications  control  center  responsible  for  receiving  initial  incident notification,  dispatching  prescribed initiating emergency operation plan protocols IAW installation directives, informing leadership of the situation, and maintaining C2 with forces.  The ECC controllers and on duty SF flight  leadership  may  act  as  the  day-to-day  BDOC,  all  dependent  on  the installation commander‘s preference. tactical  response  forces, initial 2.2.9.3.

CBRNE  Resource  Protection.    CBRNE  resource  protection  provides  the  force  with survival  and  sustainment  measures  to  operate  during  conventional  and  irregular  CBRNE warfare events.  It includes the physical measures taken to protect equipment, personnel, and facilities  from  the  effects  of  CBRNE  hazards.    Physical  protection  must  be  combined  with threat-based FPCONs and procedures to minimize mission degradation and provide the most effective  defense  against  CBRNE  hazards.    Specific  protection  measures  are  influenced  by the  expected  threat,  unit  mission,  and  type  of  resource  to  be  protected.    Other  factors  also affect the ability to employ the optimum protective measure (e.g., lacking enough equipment at a bare base to construct revetments for all vital resources).  Some protection measures are threat-specific  (e.g.,  covering  equipment  with  barrier  material  prior  to  a  chemical  release, blast  protection  on  any  new  construction).    Other  measures  provide  broader  protection against  multiple  threats  (e.g.,  hardened  facilities  provide  shelter,  blast  protection,  and overhead  cover).    Theater  and  Joint  Task  Force  requirements  may  establish  additional requirements  beyond  AF  minimum  standards.    Planning  for  expedient  and  long-term hardening  as  well  as  enough  barrier  material  is  essential  to  protect  our  resources  from CBRNE weapons effects. 2.2.10.1.  Equipment Protection.  Ensure mission critical equipment is protected from the effects  of  CBRNE  hazards  when  possible.    The  threat‘s  nature  dictates  whether  the following  installation  considerations  should  be  taken  into  account  when  protecting  vital resources:  dispersing  equipment  or  assets,  riveting  or  placing  equipment  in  hardened structures  to  lessen  blast  effects  and  to  avoid  contamination,  and  placing  one-of-a-kind equipment  assets  in  hardened  facilities.    The  plan  should  also  include  how  to  handle contaminated  or  damaged  assets  when  equipment  protection  fails.    LRS  must  have  a tracking system for all contaminated vehicles.  Proper marking must be accomplished for equipment to warn others that the asset is contaminated.  Determine if the equipment was effectively  decontaminated;  thereby  enabling  the  removal  of  hazard  marking  once decontamination  operations  are  complete.    When  prioritizing  equipment  protection activities,  consider  what  the  mission  impact  will  be  if  equipment  is  contaminated  or damaged.   32  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 for  planning  are 2.2.10.2.  Personnel  Protection.  Planning is  necessary to  ensure personnel  are protected to survive and operate to the maximum extent possible despite the existence of CBRNE hazards.    Written  procedures  and  availability  of  protective  equipment  are  designed  to protect  the  health  and  safety  of  personnel  before,  during,  and  after  a  CBRNE  event.  Planning  includes:  procedures  designed  to  keep  personnel  out  of  a  hazard  area (avoidance); medical measures (preventive medicine, vaccines, fit and healthy force); and identifying  equipment  and  facilities  that  provide  protection  by  design.    Additional considerations IPE,  PPE,  medical  prophylaxes,  sheltering, decontamination,  and  response  actions  training.   The  military  protective  mask (MCU2A/P  series,  M45,  and/or  Joint  Service  General  Purpose  Mask  (JSGPM)  (M50)) provides  a  diverse  range  of  CBRN  airborne  hazard  protection  to  the  wearer  and  is immediately available for use once issued.  As such, the Surgeon General has approved that  the  mask  can  be  used  by  all  military  and  government  employees  requiring  CBRN protection  for  emergency  escape  situations  or  the  conduct  of  critical  uniquely  military missions outside of wartime operations in the absence of local health and operational risk assessments  deeming  this  mask  inappropriate.    The  military  protective  mask,  like  all respiratory protection, has limitations.  For emergency responders specifically responding to  hazardous  material  CBRNE  events  during  irregular  warfare  activities,  NIOSH approved respiratory protection is required per AF guidance.  These limitations must be considered when planning and executing missions.  Refer to Attachment 2 for details on the analysis process and considerations.  Security Forces, in coordination with  LRS and Emergency Management, should develop  personnel  protection plans and issue available IPE  and  PPE  items  to  enemy  prisoners  of  war  (EPW),  retained  personnel,  civilian internees, and other detainees in AF custody. 2.2.10.2.1.  Sheltering.   The installation commander is  responsible for establishing a shelter plan and should designate unit responsibility for preparing and operating each shelter  during  a  CBRNE  event.    Shelters  are  structures  that  protect  personnel  from CBRNE  effects  over  extended  periods.    Walls,  doors,  and  windows  offer  limited physical barriers to CBRNE hazards penetration.  Although filter systems in heating, ventilation,  and  cooling  systems  can  remove  levels  of  particulates,  they  should  be shut  off  to  prevent  CBRN  hazard  spread.    Personnel  may  be  required  to  shelter-in-place (SIP) in the event the type or extent of the hazard is unknown and/or evacuation at the time would be dangerous.  Although military masks can be used for emergency escape purposes, the installation populace is  essentially unprotected during irregular warfare  with  the  exception  of  sheltering  in  place  or  implementing  evacuation procedures in a timely manner.  Commanders may also use the shelter infrastructure during quarantine and/or isolation operations if necessary in the aftermath of an attack with  a  contagious  biological  agent.    Refer  to  Attachment  4  for  detailed  sheltering procedures. 2.2.10.2.2.  Withdrawal/Evacuation.    Withdrawal  is  a  protective  action  used  when responders  are  in  imminent  danger  or  when  all  response  actions  are  complete.  Withdrawal  may  be to  Attachment  5  for withdrawl/evacuation  TTPs  specifically  Figure  A5.10    Recommended  Improvised Explosive  Device  (IED)  Minimum  Evacuation  Distance  (MED),  be  used  when determining  MED.    Move  victims  away  from  the  scene  and  away  from  responders.  immediate  or  planned.   Refer AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   33  Evacuation is a protective action to remove all personnel from a threatened area to a safer location.  It is typically regarded as the controlled relocation of people from an area of known danger or unacceptable risk to a safer area or to an area of acceptable risk.  Responders must always consider their own safety prior to entering a potentially hazardous environment to rescue others. 2.2.10.3.  Facility Protection.  Appropriate assessments and planning should be conducted to  ensure  facilities  comply  with  Unified  Facilities  Criteria  (UFC)  standards  for antiterrorism protection (e.g., standoff from fence lines, standoff from parking areas, and laminated  windows).    Expedient  hardening  methods  may  be  employed  to  mitigate  blast effects until permanent retro-fitting can be completed.  In addition to hardening, attention should  be  given  to  keeping  interior  spaces  contamination  free.    Collective  protection  in facilities  provides  the  best  protection  as  long  as  the  proper  maintenance  and  training  is completed.    Most  installations  have  little  or  no  collective  protection  and  retro-fitting  is expensive and time consuming.  In order to mitigate these shortfalls, implement low-cost procedures such as closing windows and doors, shutting off HVAC systems, using boot and  glove  troughs  (placed  outside  facilities)  prior  to  entry,  and  ensuring  contaminated personnel  process  through  a  CCA  prior  to  entry.    In  extreme  emergencies,  ensuring personnel  decontaminate  themselves  and  their  ground  crew  ensembles  (GCE)  prior  to entry  is  a  low-cost  and  effective  means  in  reducing  the  CBRN  facility  contamination.  Attachment 4 contains more detailed information on facility protection requirements. 2.2.10.4.  Critical  Missions.    Appropriate  pre-event  assessments  and  planning  should  be conducted  to  identify  critical  missions  that  will  need  to  continue  during  and  following CBRN  incidents.    The  Commander  should  explore  shelter-in-place  and  relocation  or transfer options available to these critical missions prior to an actual incident occurring, and  should  make  additional  plans  based  on  whether  or  not  the  critical  mission  can continue  from  its  current  location.    AFI  10-208  provides  additional  guidance  in  critical mission planning. 2.2.11.  Mutual  Aid  Agreements/Host  Nation  (HN)  Support  Agreements.    Commanders develop  and  execute  Mutual  Aid  Agreements  (MAAs)  as  directed  in  AFI  25-201,  Support Agreement Procedures.  Additional guidance for the use of MAAs may be found in AFI 10-2501, and AFMAN 10-2502.  MAA templates can be downloaded from the AF Emergency Management  Community  of  Practice  under  folder  F:  Publications  and  Plans/Mutual  Aid Agreements.    A  CBRNE  attack  or  incident  OCONUS  will  involve  the  HN  in  one  form  or another  and  HN  considerations  must  be  taken  into  account  when  planning  installation CBRNE defense.  There may be a requirement to report all CBRNE events to HN authorities and for existing Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA).  Mutual aid agreements, supplemental mutual  aid  agreements  or  memorandums  of  understanding  may  be  required  to  obtain  HN support to ensure effective response during a CBRNE incident on a fixed installation.  These agreements may include civil and military assistance rendered by the host nation to US forces within  its  territory  during  peacetime,  crises,  emergencies,  or  war  based  on  agreements mutually concluded between nations.  Host nation laws or SOFAs may  require that the  AF relinquish control of the incident to local or national authorities, especially when the incident has  the  potential  to  impact  citizens  of  the  HN.    A  prime  example  would  be  a  contagious disease  outbreak  that  affects  the  local  community  as  well  as  the  installation.    The  HN  may decide to vaccinate all of their citizens and direct the AF to follow suit with all US military,   34  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 civilians,  contractors,  and  dependents.    Issues  like  this  should  be  worked  out  between  the parties and detailed in the MAAs. 2.2.12.  Planning Considerations for Conventional CBRNE Attack Threats.  Many aspects of CBRNE  preparedness  apply  regardless  of   However,  special considerations  should  be  given  during  the  planning  phase  when  dealing  with  conventional CBRNE attacks.  One of the largest considerations is the posture of the base population.  The majority  of  the  base  population  is  equipped  with  readily  available  protective  equipment,  so approaches  to  personnel  and  equipment  protection  should  be  more  straightforward.  Similarly,  the  population  is  typically  military  members;  as  such,  mission  continuation  is typically the priority. the  attack‘s  nature. 2.2.12.1.  Contamination  Avoidance.    Contamination  avoidance  is  defined  as  taking actions  to  avoid  or  reduce  the  effects  of  a  CBRN  attack  and  to  minimize  the  effects  of CBRN contamination hazards.  AFTTP 3-2.56, is a source of comprehensive information on this subject. 2.2.12.2.  While  the  specific  TTPs  will  vary,  the  concept  of  contamination  avoidance applies  to  each  individual  element  of  CBRN  materials  –  regardless  of  the  environment (home  station,  deployed,  conventional  warfare,  irregular  warfare,  etc).    In  order  to establish the best  possible foundation for success in  the execution phase,  contamination avoidance  must  be  carefully  considered  during  the  CBRN  planning  and  vulnerability assessment processes.  CBRN planners must ensure they fully consider the strengths and weaknesses of contamination avoidance measures throughout the threat spectrum and not limit  actions  to  only  conventional  chemical  warfare  activities.    The  representative contamination  avoidance  activities  in  Table  2.8,  outlines  what  CBRN  planners  and vulnerability assessment analysts should consider during the performance of their duties. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   35   Table 2.8.

Recognition of the impact of the chemical droplet fall phase during ―release of personnel‖ timeline decisions (Alarm Black, General Release for example).  Use of uncontaminated assets rather than contaminated assets whenever possible.

Adherence to strict cordon control protocols.  Initiation of appropriate SIP activities (and subsequent evacuation actions) at time of attack.  Rapid assessment of what resources may have been exposed to hazard, with follow-on action (if appropriate for hazard) of using uncontaminated assets rather than potentially contaminated assets whenever possible.  Use of expedient protection measures (gloves of any type for instance) to avoid skin contact (within context of hazard).  Consideration for potential of re-aerosolization during respiratory protection-related decisions.  Implementation of restriction of movement (ROM) measures if appropriate.  Use of personnel who have been vaccinated against disease in question whenever possible in regards to accomplishment of mission operations in potentially affected area(s).  Implementation of FPCON measures to direct the increased use of detection equipment among first responders, and help prevent unauthorized access of these materials onto the installation.

Establishment of operational exposure guidelines (maintaining principle of ALARA), with supportive use of dosimeters to ensure personnel safety.   Nuclear Home Station or Deployed, Conventional Warfare 2.2.12.3.  CBRN Zones Option.  Airbase zoning can be an effective technique to reduce inefficiencies  and  mission  degradation  that  result  from  a  "one  base,  one  response" reaction  to  CBRNE  threats.    Installations  will  use  this  technique  during  conventional CBRN warfare activities and will strongly consider its use for irregular warfare incidents.  This concept manages protective actions and IPE/MOPP by dividing the installation into zones.    The  UCC  or  EOC  directs  and  controls  movement  into  and  out  of  contaminated areas.  Individuals or teams do not enter or exit contaminated areas or move contaminated equipment into uncontaminated areas without UCC or EOC approval.  The use of CBRN zones requires a base-wide communications system, a well-trained base population, and senior  leadership  that  know  the  limitations  provided  by  this  technique.    Table  2.9,  is  a quick start guide for establishing zones. Table 2.9.  Considerations for Establishing CBRN Zones Work center disposition within the area.   Physical features. Accessibility and requirement for transition points. Responsibility for the area. Potential three-dimensional aspect. Compatibility with established or developing integrated defense sectors. 2.2.12.3.1.  Work center disposition within the area.  The designation of a very large zone  may  be  feasible  if  there  are  few  work  centers  located  in  the  area  (runway, alternate runway and section of perimeter road for instance).  On the other hand, one large work area with a clearly defined boundary (munitions storage site) would be a good candidate for a single zone designation. 2.2.12.3.2.  Physical  features.    Zone  boundaries  should  be  easily  discernable  to planners, C2 personnel and the base populace alike.  It is better to have one zone on AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   37  the north side of a main thoroughfare and another zone on the south side, as opposed to  designating  zone  boundaries  that  split  buildings  and  parking  lots.    Group  similar surface areas, (concrete and asphalt versus concrete and sand), into the major portion of  the  zone.    This  grouping  of  similar  surfaces  will  simplify  MOPP  declarations because  of  the  differences  in  chemical  hazard  duration  timelines  between  the surfaces. 2.2.12.3.3.  Accessibility and requirement for transition points.  It is desirable to have clear  access  routes  into  and  out  of  zones.    Whenever  possible,  these  access  points should  have  a  relatively  large  work  area  in  the  immediate  vicinity  because  of  the potential  need  for  manpower  elsewhere.    These  work  areas,  with  accompanying instructional signs and personnel, can become the backbone for zone transition points where  CBRN  contamination  identification,  marking  and  decontamination  activities take  place.    The  transition  points  can  also  serve  as  the  briefing/debriefing  point  by informing  personnel  of  the  actions  they  must  take  prior  to  entering  the  next  zone, MOPP levels, and dangers present in the area they are about to enter. 2.2.12.3.4.  Responsibility  for  the  Area.    This  factor  applies  on  collocated  operating bases in which the AF is sharing the installation with the host nation, allied nations or a  sister  service.    While  it  is  preferable  that  all  organizations  and  units  on  the installation react in the same manner  prior to, during, and after an attack, experience has shown that goal is not always achievable. 2.2.12.3.5.  Potential  Three-Dimensional  Aspect.    Zone  designations  may  become three-dimensional.    If  the  installation  populace  has  been  trained  and  the  detection equipment  is  suitable,  the  zones  can  ―go  up,  not  out.‖    For  example,  during  an incident  where  SIP  is  directed  the  upper  floors  of  buildings  have  less  agent concentration  than  at  ground  level  (the  exception  would  be  if  penetration  radiation were  on  the  rooftop).    Once  contamination  is  located  and  cordoned  off,  you  can further reduce the sectors into a lower protective posture.  The area within the cordon will remain at the higher level of protection. 2.2.12.3.6.  Compatibility  with  Established  Integrated  Defense  Sectors.    Zone concepts are easier to implement if only one system is employed.  However, if that is not  feasible,  SF  and  EM  personnel  must  ensure  the  zone  designations  are  clearly different  both  in  terms  of  nomenclature  and  map  designations.    For  example,  the integrated defense sectors might be labeled #1 through #4, while the CBRN zones are labeled  ―A‖  through  ―H.‖  The  objective  is  to  develop  easily  discernible  zone boundaries  to  simplify  understanding  by  planners,  C2  personnel  and  the  base populace.  Once planners develop the zones, the installation must conduct training to ensure  UCCs  and  all  personnel  fully  understand  and  are  able  to  execute  their responsibilities.    Figure  2.7,  provides  a  notional  example  of  an  installation  zone identification map. 2.2.12.3.7.  How to  Use  Zones (An example).When an incident  or attack  warning is declared; all personnel assume the appropriate IPE and take protective actions.  Once the incident or attack is  over and Alarm Black is announced, the EOC should direct CBRN  reconnaissance  teams  and  other  specialized  teams  to  conduct  CBRN reconnaissance  and  report  their  results.    The  EOC  staff,  in  consultation  with  the   38  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 CBRN  Control  Center,  medical  representatives,  and  any  other  agencies  involved analyze  the  post-  incident  or  attack  results,  consider  the  sensitivity  of  available detectors, identify the contamination footprints and downwind hazards, and determine what  zones are  affected.    If the incident  involved in  an  attack  with  air burst  tactical ballistic  missiles  then  the  commander  must  consider  the  potential  impact  of  the chemical  droplet  fall  phase  before  implementing  split-MOPP  or  directing  personnel other  than  those  performing  mission-essential  tasks,  to  leave  shelter  or  overhead cover.  Following the attack analysis and mission assessment, the EOC will provide each  UCC  with  the  commander's  decision  and  installation  hazard  locations.    Each UCC  is  responsible  for  controlling  their  forces  and  limiting  movement  between contaminated  and  non-contaminated  zones.    When  contamination  is  present  on  the installation  and  movement  is  required,  individuals  do  not  move  between  zones without  direction  from  their  UCCs  or  approval  from  other  higher  authority.    When movement  is  required,  use  the  appropriate  contamination  control  procedures  as directed by the EOC or UCC. Figure 2.7.  Installation Zone Identification Notional Example  2.2.12.3.8.  Considerations  for  Using  CBRN  Zones.    Consider  assigning  zone  chiefs to establish transition points and control the movement of mission critical equipment and  personnel  between  contaminated  and  uncontaminated  areas.    These  transition points should have instructional signs that direct individual actions.  Consider placing individual  detection  and  decontamination  assets  (M8/M9  paper,  RSDL,  and  M295 decontamination  kits)  at  these  areas  so  that  personnel  can  accomplish  required contamination control activities and replenish depleted supplies.  The CBRN Control Center must use CBRN detectors and modeling tools in close coordination with DOD Weather  specialists  continually  monitoring  weather  conditions  [e.g.,  local  OSS Weather  Flight  and/or  Operational  Weather  Squadron  (OWS)  responsible  for  the region] to assess contact, inhalation, and percutaneous vapor or radiation penetration hazards,  to  include  those  downwind  of  the  contamination  source.    Use  these assessments to recommend zone MOPP changes. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   39  2.2.12.3.9.  Zone  Signs.    The  use  of  standardized  signs  at  zone  transition  points  is required.  Signs, versus the posting of zone transition point attendants, will suffice if installation personnel are aware of the CBRN hazards in various parts of the base, are able  to  accomplish  required  protection  and  contamination  control  activities,  and  are aware  of  the  zone  boundaries  through  local  handouts  and  clear  pictures  on  the commander‘s channel or installation local area networks.  Zone signs should use large obtrusive  markings  and  depict  the  zone  designation,  alarm  condition,  MOPP  level, and  desired  activities  such  as  decontamination  and  marking  of  contaminated  assets.  These  signs  must  be  checked  and  updated  to  ensure  continuity  of  information  and proper direction for transiting personnel. 2.2.12.3.10.  Physical  Barriers.    The  competency  of  the  base  populace  and  the adequacy of the  Installation  Notification and Warning System  (INWS) are the main considerations  when  determining  if  physical  barriers  are  needed  at  CBRN  zone boundaries.  A physical barrier is any marking that delineates between contaminated and  uncontaminated  areas.    These  barriers  can  be  cones,  construction  tape,  CBRN markers and any resource used to clearly identify the areas. 2.2.12.3.11.  CBRN  Zone  Transition  Points.    The  number  of  transition  areas  into  a particular zone should be a balance between mission requirements and entry control.  Do  not  block  a  key  segment  of  an  aircraft  taxiway  and  force  aircraft  and maintenance/munitions  vehicles  to  detour  large  distances.    Conversely,  do  not  leave streets  open  into  an  area  when  mission  requirements  can  be  met  and  better contamination  avoidance achieved with  fewer access  points.  During a  conventional threat or conventional attack, zone transition points are not required to be used unless otherwise directed.  Refer to Table 2.10, for transition point guidelines. Table 2.10.  CBRN Zone Transition Point Operational Guidelines Competently accomplish the required contamination avoidance measures prior to transitioning to/from-contaminated areas. Do not take contaminated assets out of the contaminated zone unless necessary. Conduct operational decontamination and clearly identify the asset as being contaminated and remain in the appropriate level of IPE when using the contaminated asset. Warn personnel in other areas of the danger associated with the contaminated asset. 2.2.12.3.12.  Boundary  markers should not  be necessary around the perimeter of the pre-designated  zones.    Rather,  these  markers  may  be  required  to  prevent  access  at selected points, and to funnel traffic through designated transition areas in much the same  manner  as  normal  security  checkpoints  are  used.    In  fact,  established  security checkpoints  typically  function  well  as  transition  areas.    Installation  CBRN  planners must recognize that if selected access  points are used for zone transition operations, the tendency of some base populace members on foot will be able to cut across zones by the most direct route possible – bypassing the transition stations. 2.2.12.3.13.  Transition  Area  Attendants.   EM  personnel  must  determine,  in conjunction  with  key  leadership,  if  attendants  will  be  used  at  transition  points.  Consideration must be given to how well the base populace is trained in actions taken at  the  transition  points,  and  manpower  availability  since  this  will  require  several   40  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 people to be available to man these transition points.  The manpower for this tasking will come from augmentation of existing forces if the installation commander deems it  necessary.    EM  personnel  will  inform  their  Higher  Headquarters  staff  of  the required manpower so that the appropriate number and type of UTCs can be sourced.  This  information  is  required  to  be  included  in  the  CBRN  Annex  of  the  IGESP  or similar  governing  document.    EM  personnel  must  provide  the  required  training  and assets  for  zone  transition  point  attendants.    CBRN  reconnaissance  personnel  should periodically  check  on  the  status  of  the  individual/transition  area  as  they  move throughout their specified reconnaissance areas. 2.2.12.3.14.  Recommended  Materials  for  Zone  Transition  Points.    When  possible, materials to facilitate required activities should be readily available at zone transition points.    These  materials  vary  according  to  the  specific  CBRN  threat  but  typically include:  stocks  of  M8  paper,  RSDL  kits,  M295  decontamination  kits,  mops  and buckets  of  5  percent  chlorine  solutions,  hand  and  boot  troughs,  hand  troughs  with clean water, contaminated waste disposal receptacles, marking signs or materials for depicting contaminated assets, and sealed water containers.  Signs must be developed to tell personnel the MOPP level in the zone they are entering, alarm condition, zone number,  and  actions  before  leaving  and  entering  contaminated  areas.    (Table  2.11., provides detailed information on exit and entry actions. Table 2.11.  Contaminated Area Exit and Enter Actions Actions Before Exiting a Contaminated Zone Check vehicle and cargo for contamination. If asset is contaminated and is not mission essential leave in contaminated zone. Use uncontaminated assets unless the asset is mission essential and there are no other uncontaminated assets available. Accomplish operational decontamination of assets as required. Mark assets that are contaminated. If on foot, conduct self decontamination with M295 and RSDL kits and decontaminate boots in chlorine solution.   Actions Before Entering a Contaminated Zone Assume required MOPP level. Ensure you have all required equipment such as decontamination kits and M8 paper. Fill or replace canteen. 2.2.12.4.  Threat  Detection  Grid.    CBRN  agent  detection  and  identification  activities provide commanders with the information needed to determine protective postures and to tailor protective actions to the specific threats.  The detection grid provides an adjustable sensor  capability  for  detecting  airborne  and  surface  CBRN  contamination  during conventional  and  irregular  warfare  operations,  with  the  set-up  and  implementation  of detectors based on the threat profile at the time.  The detection grid layout must consider hazard  characterization  requirements  for  the  highest  priorities,  such  as  mission  critical areas, facilities and population centers.  Early detection provides more time to implement protective measures.  Accurate identification of CBRN materials enables selection of the most effective protective actions and medical treatment, and reduces mission degradation by limiting unnecessary response actions. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   41  2.2.12.4.1.  The threat  analysis will determine when the detection grid is  required to be  established  and  operational.    In  most  cases,  the  detection  grid  will  not  be  placed out during normal day-to-day operations.  CBRN detection and identification includes the  use  of  available  detection  assets  and  methods,  risk  assessment  and  all  available medical  and  non-medical  intelligence  assets.    Plume  modeling  also  impacts  the detection grid plan development.  The planners must consider the different strategies for detection (e.g., detection for protection, detection for treatment and detection for warning.)  Readiness and Emergency Management Flights must establish a plan that is  coordinated  with  other  base  agencies  (Bioenvironmental,  Public  Health,  Fire Emergency  Services,  EOD,  and  Weather  personnel  responsible  for  the  region)  to ensure the plan considers all threats and utilizes all appropriate resources.  This plan must be routinely exercised to ensure accuracy and success.  Use the Readiness and Emergency  Management  Flight  Playbook  for  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological, and  Nuclear  (CBRN)  and  Passive  Defense  Response  Standards  located  on  the Readiness  and  Emergency  Management  Community  of  Practice  (CoP)  for  the procedures  and  steps  on  how installation  detection  grid.  https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-EN-CE-52-7-26&Filter=OO-EN-CE-52 to  establish the 2.2.12.4.2.  Critical  Equipment.    Identify  and  plan  actions  to  protect  critical equipment  when  CBRNE  threats  increase.    Actions  may  include  dispersing equipment,  hardening,  providing  overhead  cover,  and  closing  windows,  doors,  and aircraft canopies.  For sensitive satellite, computer, and communication equipment, a back-up power supply may be warranted.  Actions should be included within AT/FP and alarm condition checklists. 2.2.12.5.  Trigger Events.  Trigger events indicate that a CBRNE event is likely to occur, may have occurred, or is occurring, and will prompt commanders to initiate a response.  Many publications discuss trigger events only within the context of biological incidents; however,  the  trigger  event  mechanism  applies  across  the  spectrum  of  CBRNE  attack situations.    Trigger  events  provide  time-critical  information  that  will  help  tailor  the installation‘s  response.    Trigger  events  may  occur  outside  the  perimeter  of  the installation, thus the installation must establish and maintain close ties with state or host nation  and  local  public  health  departments.    There  are  four  categories  of  trigger  events signaling CBRNE events: intelligence triggers; weapons triggers; detector triggers; and a sentinel casualty. 2.2.12.5.1.  Intelligence  warning  trigger  events  occur  when  a  commander  receives convincing information or intelligence indicating that a CBRNE event is imminent. 2.2.12.5.2.  Weapons  trigger  events  refer  to  attacks  by  a  weapon  system(s),  such  as theater ballistic missile, vehicle bomb, or observed attacks employing other delivery means  such  as  an  aerosol  sprayer.    If  any  possibility  of  adversary  CBRN  capability exists,  installations  should  initially  react  to  weapons  events  as  if  they  contained CBRN materials. 2.2.12.5.3.  Detector alarm trigger events refer to the discovery of a CBRNE event via a  positive  result  from  a  detection  device,  bomb  dog,  laboratory  report  from   42  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 environmental  samples,  or  a  positive  food/water  sample  indicating  that  CBRN contamination is present in the environment. 2.2.12.5.4.  A  Sentinel  Casualty  trigger  event  refers  to  the  medical  community‗s detection of a covert chemical, biological, or radiological event by assessing trends in medical symptoms among personnel or the diagnosis of an index case. 2.2.12.6.  CBRN  Warning  and  Reporting  System  (CBRNWRS).    The  purpose  of  the CBRNWRS is to verify  enemy use of CBRN weapons for the President and inform US Forces, allies and friendly governments of the impending or actual use of CBRN weapons by an enemy.  See AFTTP (I) 3-2.56, for details about the CBRNWRS. 2.2.12.6.1.  Installation  Notification  and  Warning  System.    The  INWS  must  provide effective  coverage  for  all  installation  areas.    Local  warning  signals  should  be prominently  displayed  and  included  in  locally  developed  plans.    The  INWS  should use  warning  signals  that  are  compatible  with  host-nation,  local,  or  theater  systems.  The effective use of a rapid, multi-capability INWS is crucial to force protection and mission  operations.    Commanders  use  warning  signals  to  posture  installations  for attacks,  warn  of  attacks  in  progress,  initiate  attack  recovery  actions,  and  return installations  to  a  state  of  readiness.    Warning  requires  real-time  or  near-real-time detection  equipment,  a  reliable  warning  system,  and  a  well-trained  base  populace.  The  INWS  must  consider  areas  where  excessive  noise  such  as  jet  engines  may prevent  individuals  from  hearing  sirens,  mobile  radios,  telephones  etc,  and supplement the warning system to address this vulnerability. 2.2.12.6.2.  Local  Commander.    The  local  commander  and  the  EOC  director  decide when  to  disseminate  a  warning  for  the  installation  and  report  the  attack  to  Higher Headquarters after weighing all available information.  The commander consults with EM  personnel,  public  health  preventive  medicine,  operations  and  intelligence  staffs regarding  the  available  information.    Through  these  staff  elements,  the  local commander  monitors  and  evaluates  intelligence  reports,  detection  information, medical  information,  reports  of activities suggesting the  release of a CBRN weapon and any reports of a CBRN attack from other units or Higher Headquarters. 2.2.12.6.3.  Readiness  and  Emergency  Management  Flight.    The  Readiness  and Emergency Management Flight advises the EOC director and installation commander on  the  issuance  of  warnings  and  MOPP  levels.    However,  the  installation commander‘s decision will also be influenced by additional factors such as the time before  critical  mission  tasks  are  required  to  be  initiated,  mission  criticality,  and  the vulnerability of critical resources to CBRNE attack and/or contamination. 2.2.12.6.4.  Other Warning Systems.  Warning times will vary by threat and the real-time ability of both  theater and installation warning systems  to  disseminate warning information  for  conventional  as  well  as  irregular  warfare  threats.    Planners  should analyze the warning systems‘ performance for each primary threat to the installation.  Use  the  analysis  to  develop  a  chain-of-events  timeline  that  identifies  each  primary and secondary warning  event  from  initial  event  detection through notification to  the lowest  level.    These  timelines  enable  the  CAT  and  EOC  to  develop  and  practice scenarios and quickly adjust strategies to react to attack situations.  Commanders and their staffs must quickly analyze the available attack information, evaluate the effect AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   43  on current  operations,  and decide on the most effective  courses of  action  within the time available. 2.2.12.6.5.  Test the Process.  Test all warning systems periodically to verify system operation and warning timelines.  Develop alternate notification methods for areas of the  installation  where  the  warning  systems  are  not  available  or  sufficient.    Conduct limited  exercises  and  immediate  action  drills  to  verify  the  effectiveness  of  warning and notification systems down to the unit control center and work center levels. 2.2.13.  Response  Teams.    There  are  not  enough  specialized  CBRNE  personnel  at  home station or at a deployed location to accomplish all CBRNE-related tasks after an attack in a conventional  warfare  environment.    Consequently,  installations  use  a  combination  of specialized  personnel  and  the  general  base  populace  to  complete  CBRNE  activities.    As  a minimum,  CBRNE  planners  must  ensure  the  staffing,  training,  and  equipping  of  the following response teams: airfield and building damage assessment teams, specialized CBRN reconnaissance  teams  (composed  of  EM  personnel),  facility  post  attack  reconnaissance (PAR)  teams,  personnel  decontamination  teams  (open-air  CCA,  aircrew  CCA,  collective protection  CCA,  and  patient  decontamination),  fire  and  rescue,  EOD  render  safe  procedure (RSP) teams, and bomb removal teams. 2.2.13.1.  Base  populace  members  are  used  to  staff  PAR  teams,  open-air  CCA  teams, collective protection CCA teams, bomb removal teams, and zone transition point  (ZTP) positions.  EM technicians supervise PAR teams, open-air CCA team, and ZTP positions.  An  EOD  technician  supervises  bomb  removal  teams.    The  CEMP  10-2,  Annex  C  must identify personnel  who  will accomplish  these functions.  This  is  because personnel  will not be deployed solely for completing these duties.  Installations must provide personnel assigned  to  these  positions  with  just-in-time  training,  support  materials,  and  required equipment. 2.2.13.2.  Even  though  specialists  compose  airfield  and  building  damage  assessment, specialized  CBRN  reconnaissance,  aircrew  CCA,  and  patient  decontamination  teams, these personnel do not accomplish these functions as part of their day-to-day operations at  home  station.    Consequently,  supervisors  must  ensure  that  personnel  who  may  be tasked  to  fill  positions  on  these  teams  remain  fully  qualified  in  these  functions  at  all times.  This includes ensuring personnel accomplish these duties in local exercises. 2.2.13.3.  Personnel  Decontamination.    Personnel  decontamination  is  the  process  of neutralizing  or  removing  CBRN  contamination  from  a  person‘s  skin  or  clothing.    This can  take  multiple  forms  from  individual  one-on-one  decontamination,  buddy  system,  or processing through a decontamination line with attendants assisting.  Refer to AFTTP 3-2.60,  Multiservice  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Chemical,  Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Decontamination for further guidance. 2.2.14.  Planning  Considerations  for  Irregular  Warfare  CBRNE  Attack  Threats.    Many aspects  of  CBRNE  preparedness  apply  regardless  of  the  nature  of  the  attack.    However, special considerations should be given during the planning phase when dealing with irregular warfare  CBRNE  attacks.    One  of  the  largest  considerations  is  the  posture  of  the  base population.    The  majority  of  the  base  population  is  not  equipped  with  readily  available protective  equipment,  so  procedures  for  personnel  and  equipment  protection  will  vary.  Similarly,  the  population  is  typically  diverse  (e.g.,  children,  young  adults,  elderly,  military,   44  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 civilian,  etc.)    Therefore,  mission  continuation  challenges  may  vary.    This  document  will specifically address unique aspects as they pertain to planning in an irregular CBRNE OE. 2.2.14.1.  Response  Teams.    Specialized  personnel  are  the  primary  source  for  staffing response  teams  in  the  aftermath  of  irregular  warfare  activities  involving  CBRNE materials.    These  response  teams  fall  within  the  framework  of  the  installation  Disaster Response Force (DRF) and include fire emergency services, emergency medical service, security  forces,  EOD,  emergency  management,  patient  decontamination,  and  traumatic stress  response.    In  addition  to  remaining  technically  qualified,  these  personnel  must receive  appropriate  HAZMAT  and  AFIMS  training;  see  AFI  10-2501  for  additional details.  Each parent organization is responsible for staffing, training, and equipping these individuals and response teams IAW applicable directives. 2.2.14.2.  In the case of irregular warfare attacks involving CBRNE materials, numerous federal  response  teams  and  support  centers  exist  to  provide  assistance  as  required.    See the  CEMP  10-2  template  and  Chapter  3  in  AFTTP  3-2.56,  for  further  information regarding technical reach-back capabilities.  In regards to requesting technical reach-back support,  CBRN  planners  must  ensure  installation  leadership  understands  to  request  the required  capability,  and  not  identify  a  specific  response  team.    The  decision  of  which team to request will be made by Higher Headquarters. 2.2.14.3.  Contamination  Control.    Within  the  context  of  this  section,  contamination control  refers  to  the  containment  of  CBRN  contamination  that  was  released  during conventional  or  irregular  warfare.    In  some  cases,  an  action  could  simultaneously  be considered  both  a  contamination  control  and  a  contamination  avoidance  measure.    An example  is  the  use  of  uncontaminated  versus  contaminated  assets,  thereby  reducing  the possibilities of cross contamination.   The effectiveness  of contamination  control actions in many instances will be directly related to the degree of effort put forth regarding this area during the planning phase.  CBRN planners must consider the CBRN material  and the substance‘s reactivity characteristics with different surfaces, the anticipated size and intensity  of  the  contaminated  area,  and  the  environment  when  developing  projected contamination  control  measures.    The  availability  of  required  contamination  control resources is also a factor. 2.2.14.3.1.  Cross  contamination  between  people,  resources,  and  terrain  can  occur  if CBRN  materials  remain  on  the  surface.    Contamination  control  steps  taken  to mitigate the probability or extent of cross contamination in those cases would not be necessary  for  instances  in  which  the  CBRN  material  is  rapidly  absorbed  into  the surface, leaving behind a potential vapor hazard but not a contact-transfer problem. 2.2.14.3.2.  The  control  of  runoff  in  a  decontamination  operation  is  a  viable  and necessary  technique  during  small-scale  irregular  warfare  situations.    However,  this technique  is  neither  feasible  nor  worthwhile  in  the  aftermath  of  a  conventional warfare  attack  involving  multiple  missiles  that  contaminated  hundreds  of  resources and large areas. 2.2.14.3.3.  If  the  residual  contamination  presents  a  re-aerosolization  hazard, consideration must be given as to whether the contamination danger can be mitigated through the application of a covering or sealing material. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   45  2.2.14.3.4.  The  availability  of  CBRN  marking  kits  and  the  base  populace‘s recognition  and  use  of  expedient  CBRN  marking  signs  are  vital  when  it  comes  to warning personnel of residual contamination in areas or on specific resources. 2.2.14.3.5.  Contaminated  Waste.    During  the  CBRN  planning  and  vulnerability assessment  processes,  installations  must  address  and  prepare  for  the  identification, marking, handling, and disposal of contaminated waste.  The extent of the challenge will  largely  depend  on  the  CBRN  material  itself,  the  mass  and  quantity  of contaminated waste items, and the environment.  CBRN planners should consider the following: 2.2.14.3.5.1.  Installations  have  a  hazardous  waste  accumulation  site  that  could suffice  for  the  temporary  placement  of  small  quantities  of  CBRN  contaminated waste. 2.2.14.3.5.2.  Contaminated  waste  storage  containers  that  are  adequate  for chemical, TIC, biological, or alpha radiation may not suffice for gamma radiation sources. the  number  of  people 2.2.14.3.5.3.  In  some  situations the contaminated  waste  disposal  operation  may  be  relatively  small.    In  some environments, virtually the entire base populace and every unit on the installation are  involved.    For  example,  the  creation  and  use  of  unit  contaminated  waste disposal  areas  in  the  aftermath  of  conventional  chemical  warfare  attacks  will involve large quantities of people and units. involved in 2.2.14.3.5.4.  The  size  of  the  items  could  influence  the  collection  technique  and temporary storage locations for the contaminated waste.  The challenge posed by chemically  contaminated waste from  the munitions build area is  far  greater than the  problem  posed  by  two  used  biological  DOD  Sampling  Kits.    The  wooden pallets,  large  metal  bomb  and  guidance  system  containers,  and  metal  strapping materials not only require special equipment to move the items but also represent enough of a residual off-gassing hazard in the aftermath of a chemical attack that the items may need to be moved or nearby munitions build lines will have to be conducted in MOPP 4. 2.2.14.3.5.5.  All  personnel  must  be  aware  of  the  hazards  associated  with contaminated  waste  items.    For  instance,  personnel  must  understand  that  the RSDL  neutralizes  some  but  not  all  chemical  agents  and  M295  kits  do  not neutralize chemical agents; rather, they remove the agent from the skin or surface.  Consequently,  these  used  decontamination  materials  must  be  handled  while wearing  IPE  and  disposed  of  properly  as  opposed  to  being  dropped  at  the decontamination site. 2.2.14.4.  Contaminated Waste Collection and Disposal Operations.  Following a CBRN attack  during  a  conventional  or  irregular  operational  environment,  we  can  expect contaminated waste to be produced.  Most contaminated waste will be materials used as barrier  protection  or  during  CCA  operations.    Contaminated  waste  may  include  items such  as  RSDL/M295  decontamination  kits,  M8/M9  paper  and  munitions  packing materials.   Note:  When initially placing or replacing contaminated M8 paper as part of   46  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 the threat detection grid, the tape used to adhere the new M8 paper sheet must be marked with  date  and  time  of  replacement.    Any  form  of  tape  may  be  used  to  adhere  the  M8 paper to include M9 tape.  The installation planners must consider removal and disposal of this waste, and therefore must have a contaminated waste disposal plan to mitigate the hazards  from  the  contact  hazards  and  off-gassing  associated  with  waste  accumulation.  Planning  considerations  are  listed  in  Table  2.12.    Contaminated  waste  operations following  an  irregular  threat  can  pose  different  challenges  especially  in  a  CONUS environment when regulatory agencies impose guidelines for environmental compliance.  These  same  challenges  can  also  apply  in  host  nations  that  also  have  similar  regulatory guidelines. Table 2.12.  Contaminated Waste Control Planning Considerations Unit waste disposal points. Installation waste disposal point. Options of open storage, burning and burying. Contaminated waste areas must be marked. Installation personnel will need to be trained on disposal point locations. Installation personnel will need to be trained on contaminated waste site hazards. 2.2.14.4.1.  Contaminated Waste Sites.  If several contaminated waste collection sites exist  on  the  installation,  the  roles  and  responsibilities  governing  who  will  transport the  contaminated  waste  from  the  unit  collection  sites  to  the  centralized  installation contaminated  waste  disposal  area  must  be  clearly  articulated.    The  two  primary options that exist in this situation are either to have each unit bring their contaminated waste to the centralized disposal site or appoint a group of personnel, with specialized equipment to gather the items from each remote site. 2.2.14.4.1.1.  Installation  Sites.    For  conventional  warfare  activities,  installations must  establish  temporary  contaminated  waste  collection  sites  in  order  to  help prevent  or  control  the  spread  of  contamination.    The  collection  site  should  be established  at  both  the  unit  and  installation  level.    The  Installation  CEMP  10-2 should  clearly  define  procedures  and  identify  the  location(s)  of  the  collection point(s).    Contaminated  waste  is  collected  at  the  sites  for  later  disposal  IAW governmental or local guidelines. 2.2.14.4.1.2.  Unit Sites.  Management of unit-generated contaminated waste will be  conducted  through  the  unit‘s  contamination  control  teams  (CCT)  or  other designated  unit  personnel,  whose  responsibility  it  is  to  implement  contaminated waste  control  operations  and  establish  centralized  collection  points  for  the  unit.  Further,  CCTs  train  unit  personnel  to  collect  and  dispose  of  their  non-reusable contaminated items in these designated areas.  Use plastic bags, trashcans, barrels, and  empty  munitions  cans  for  contaminated  waste  storage.    Trash  barrels  with multiple  layers  of  plastic  bags  are  easy  to  obtain  and  simplify  waste  removal.  Mark the contaminated waste.  The disposal point should be at least 10 feet away and downwind from the rear or entrance to the facility, bunker, fighting position, or  CCA.    Clearly  identify  the  disposal  point  and  prepare  contaminated  marking signs in advance to mark containers after use.  Unit CCTs or other designated unit AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   47  personnel  are  also  responsible  for  the  transfer  of  unit  contaminated  waste  to  the installation site once the unit‘s site has reached capacity.  Unit  personnel  should empty  the  waste  from  these  unit  sites  after  every  attack  and/or  once  a  day  for CBRN events that have hazard durations longer than 24 hours.  This will mitigate the  cumulative  hazard  that  can  be  created  by  the  consolidation  of  multiple contaminated  assets  in  a  single  location.    This  cumulative  hazard  will  manifest itself in the immediate area (within 50 feet) and downwind of contaminated waste disposal sites for chemical, TIC, and biological events; and represent a 360 degree hazard  for  radiological  incidents.    If  it  is  within  the  capability  of  available resources  and  detectors,  CBRN  reconnaissance  teams  should  periodically  check unit  contaminated  waste  disposal  sites  to  ensure  the  CBRN  hazard  is  not extending to populated work centers in an otherwise uncontaminated area. 2.2.14.4.2.  Contaminated  Waste  Disposal.    The  final  disposition  of  contaminated waste  will  be  highly  dependent  upon  whether  an  installation  is  recovering  from  a conventional  or  irregular  threat  situation,  as  well  as  the  location  of  the  event.    The Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA),  along  with  State  and  local  governments, has  established  guidelines  for  the  proper  disposal  of  contaminated  waste  within  the CONUS.    The  Overseas  Environmental  Baseline  Guidance  Document  (OEBGD) and/or  country  Final  Governing  Standard  (FGS)  establish  guidelines  for  OCONUS sites.    Expeditionary  sites  not  covered  by  either  CONUS,  OEGBD/FGS  or  other established  guidelines should  consider other disposal  methods such as open storage, burying,  or  burning.    Installations  that  are  located  in  high  threat  locations  should consider  other  disposal  methods  such  as  open  storage,  burning,  or  burying.    For conventional  warfare  activities,  CE  is  responsible  for  the  selection  and  operation  of the  installation  contaminated  waste  disposal  site.    It  may  be  appropriate  for  the contaminated  waste  to  be  disposed  of  through  existing  procedures  and/or  contracts established at the installation hazardous waste accumulation point for irregular CBRN warfare  situations.    These  methods  have  individual  strengths  and  weaknesses,  to include  the  degree  and  extent  of  residual  hazards  that  are  associated  with  each.  Regardless  of  the  environment,  the  disposal  of  radiologically  contaminated  soil  will likely  not  be  within  the  capability  of  the  installation  to  accomplish  without  external assistance.    See  AFH  10-222,  Volume  4,  Environmental  Guide  for  Contingency Operations, for additional information regarding contaminated waste disposal. 2.2.14.4.2.1.  Open Storage.  Above ground, open area storage is the simplest and least costly option.  No special equipment is necessary and simple marking signs will suffice to identify the area.  Locate the storage site in an area that least affects the  installation  operations  and  will  not  require  movement  before  the  end  of hostilities.    Depending  upon  the  type  of  contamination,  this  area  may  present  a long-term contact hazard.  It may also generate a sizeable downwind vapor hazard that  extends  beyond  the  marking  signs  and  installation  boundary.    Bagging  the waste will substantially reduce-- but not eliminate--these hazards. 2.2.14.4.2.2.  Burning.  It is DOD policy to prohibit the disposal of certain waste in  open-air  burn  pits  during  contingency  operations  except  when  no  alternative disposal  method  is  feasible  as  determined  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  in Directive Type Memo (DTM) 09-032, Use of Open-air Burn Pits in Contingency   48  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 the  Secretary  of  Defense Operations.    The  Commanders  of  Combatant  Commands  are  delegated  the authority  and  responsibility  of to  determine circumstances  under  which  no  alternative  disposal  method  for  covered  waste  is feasible.    Radiological  contaminated  waste  shall  not  be  burned  under  any circumstances.    Burning  quickly  reduces  contaminated  chemical,  TIC,  and biological  waste  hazards  and  requires  little  space  or  manpower.   Burn contaminated  chemical,  TIC,  and  biological  material  completely  in  an  open-pit, diesel-fueled  fire.    Burning  will  most  likely  generate  a  low  concentration  vapor cloud and create a downwind hazard.  Select a site in an area that least affects the airbase  operations  and  minimizes  fire  or  visibility  hazards.    Coordinate  the  burn site location and burn times with the airbase fire department, Base Civil Engineer, Medical  EOC,  CBRN  Control  Center,  and  base  operations.    Coordinate  with appropriate  HN  agencies  in  expeditionary  operations  and  burning  may  create  a downwind hazard. 2.2.14.4.2.3.  Burying.  Post-conflict environmental restoration difficulties and the possibility  of  ground  water  contamination  are  the  primary  reasons  not  to  bury contaminated waste.  Another reason to avoid burying waste is the need for heavy equipment  or  a  significant  amount  of  labor  to  prepare  the  burial  site.    If  this method  is  used,  bag  the  waste  to  reduce  handling  and  removal  hazards.    Locate the  storage  site  in  an  area  that  least  affects  installation  operations  and  post marking signs accordingly.  Do not allow people or vehicles to drive over the area because  the  contaminated  material  may  rise  to  the  surface  and  create  additional hazards.  Do not bury contaminated waste without the approval of the installation commander  and  knowledge  of  the  Base  Civil  Engineer  (BCE).    If  burial  is approved,  provide  the  BCE  with  a  written  report  that  includes  the  date  burial started  and  ended,  types  and  quantity  of  material  buried,  type  of  contamination, the  location  (Global  Positioning  System  coordinates  are  preferred),  and  the  size and depth of the excavation. 2.2.14.4.2.4.  For  additional  information  on  waste  disposal  procedures,  refer  to in  Air  Force  Technical  Order  11C15-1-3  Chemical  Warfare guidelines Decontamination, Detection and Disposal of Decontaminating Agents, and AFH 10-222, Volume 4. 2.2.14.5.  Decontamination.    Planning  for  the  conduct  of  effective  decontamination operations  is  a  multi-faceted  task.    Several  decontamination  planning  factors  must  be considered:  the  CBRN  material  itself;  the  standards  of  cleanliness  associated  with  the environment or mission requirement; available time, manpower, and resources. that  any  decontamination  operation  will 2.2.14.5.1.  CBRN planners and installation leadership must be aware of what can and cannot be accomplished through decontamination activities.  For instance, it is highly unlikely in  100  percent uncontaminated  resources,  regardless  of  the  environment.    For  example,  complete decontamination  is  not  possible  once  the  chemical  agent  absorbs  into  the  surface  of many  materials;  total  removal  of  the  substance  is  required  to  attain  this  level  of cleanliness.    Further,  the  sizes  of  many  of  the  anticipated  radioactive  particles produced  by  tactical  nuclear  weapons,  improvised  nuclear  weapons,  or  radiological result AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   49  dispersal  devices  are  too  small  to  see  and  will  infiltrate  into  cracks  and  seams, adhering to oil film and sealant materials. 2.2.14.5.2.  CBRN planners also face a challenge in the decontamination area wherein a lack of data and standards are available for several key situations.  For example: 2.2.14.5.2.1.  The  DOD  and  AF  do  not  possess  a  comprehensive  reference document that provides detailed decontamination instructions for the multitude of potential  TIC  hazards  in  regards  to  resources  (aircraft,  vehicles,  facilities,  etc.).  While  documents as  AFTTP  3-2.60,  provide  decontamination recommendations  for  specific  chemical-biological  agent/surface  combinations, they do not provide similar matrices for likely TIC hazards that installations may encounter during irregular CBRN warfare activities. such 2.2.14.5.2.2.  There  are  a  number  of  personnel  chemical  and  TIC  exposure standards that are published, including: immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH),  airborne  exposure  limits  (AEL),  airborne  exposure  guideline  levels (AEGL).    The  interpretation  and  use  of  these  standards  can  be  challenging  for untrained personnel and may not apply to conventional CBRN warfare situations.  In  addition,  these  standards  may  not  be  appropriate  for  use  in  critical  mission operations  in  the  aftermath  of  irregular  CBRN  warfare  attacks  because  of  the increased  acceptance  of  risk  inherent  with  military  activities  and  the  fact  that these standards were built for a wider range of non-military people.  Further, these personnel exposure standards are not specifically identified as ―decontamination‖ standards.    Medical  professionals  should  be  consulted  when  making  these determinations. 2.2.14.5.2.3.  Internationally agreed-upon decontamination standards do not exist for  all  conventional  and  irregular  CBRN  warfare  activities  (e.g.,  cleanliness requirements  associated  with  aircraft  over-flight/landing  clearances.).    The associated  deficiencies  in  this  area  are  what  drove  the  Air  Mobility  Command (AMC)  and  the  Transportation  Command  (TRANSCOM)  to  develop  their ―exchange zone‖ concept of operations. 2.2.14.5.3.  CBRN planners must also consider the impact of not having chemical and biological  detectors  capable  of  providing  sufficient  capacity the effectiveness of decontamination in a timely manner. to  verify 2.2.14.5.4.  It  is  imperative  that  CBRN  planners  consider  and  assess  the  ability  to successfully  execute  decontamination  activities.    This  assessment  must  consider required  timelines,  the  number  of  people  or  resources  that  must  be  decontaminated, and the safety of the process. 2.2.14.5.5.  Unit CCT activation is not normally required for wartime immediate and operational  levels  of  decontamination.    All  personnel  are  expected  to  perform  these levels  of  decontamination  using  the  RSDL  and  M295  decontamination  kits  or  field expedient  methods.    Vehicle,  equipment,  munitions,  aircraft  maintenance,  and  base populace  personnel  are  expected immediate  and  operational decontamination  on  their  assigned  assets.    Form  and  activate  CCTs  if  thorough decontamination  is  required.    The  installation  commander  will  have  to  decide  if  the to  execute   50  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 accomplishment  of  thorough  decontamination  is  likely  to  produce  an  operationally-beneficial  result,  and  if  the  time  and  resources  required  to  conduct  decontamination operations  is  worth  the  effort  to  increase  operational  tempo  or  reduce  the  MOPP level.  The installation commander will determine if there is a need for an installation CCT  or  if  those  units  identified  to  establish  CCTs  are  required  to  conduct  those decontamination operations.  For example, if there are a large number of vehicles that must  be  decontaminated;  the  installation  commander  can  decide  to  have    the  LRS (Transportation) conduct the decontamination operation or set up a team from several base  agencies  with  a  Transportation  representative  to  oversee  the  operation.    Teams will  receive  just-in-time  training  from  the  Readiness  and  Emergency  Management Flight when the requirement for CCTs is established. 2.2.14.5.5.1.  To  facilitate  the  success  of  just-in-time  training,  units  should conduct thorough decontamination planning by identifying command and control relationships,  team  requirements,  equipment  requirements,  decontamination assets,  and  contaminated  waste  collection  points.    Readiness  and  Emergency Management Flight personnel will provide assistance to the CCTs in developing their team checklists to guide activities.  Focus these plans and checklists on unit tasks  such  as  critical  cargo  movement  and  post-conflict  decontamination operations.    Include  requirements  in  the  CEMP  10-2  and  base  or  joint  support plan.    Do  not  confuse  wartime  decontamination  requirements  presented  in  this Manual  with  other  CCT  requirements  such  as  those  used  for  nuclear  weapon accidents, terrorist WMD, or hazardous material emergency response.  See Table 2.13., for equipment considerations for CCTs.  Additional guidance is provided in AFI 10-2501. Table 2.13.  Equipment Considerations for CCTs Mops, brooms, or scrub brushes Plastic sheeting Buckets  Water Water hoses  CBRN detectors  Sand-bags (to create berms around area) HEPA vacuum cleaner (nuclear/radiological) Decontaminate (chlorine solution, soap, or other) High-pressure washer (military decontamination assets or any commercial version) 2.3.  Training  and  Exercises.  The  AF  must  put  a  high  priority  on  training  and  exercises  in everything we do.  Training provides the required knowledge and skills to plan for, respond to, and  recover  from  conventional  and  irregular  warfare  CBRNE  events.    To  complement  the training,  installations  must  include  realistic  exercises  and  scenarios  demonstrating  the  level  of proficiency  required  for  evaluation  purposes.    All  personnel,  i.e.  military,  civilians,  and contractors  on  the  installation  should  participate  in  training  and  exercises.    Additionally, integrated exercises involving all plans listed in Table 2.2, with underlying operational scenarios are the best method to evaluate mission continuation effects during a CBRNE event. 2.3.1.  Exercises  are  a  means  to  plan,  conduct,  and  execute  realistic,  integrated  tactics, techniques,  and  procedures  from  all  installation  personnel,  and  to  provide  accurate  and honest feedback on the installation‘s CBRN response capability.  The following are examples of  areas  that  require  both  training  and  exercising:  force  protection/anti-terrorism,  CBRNE defense skills, response teams, UCC operations, and sheltering. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   51  2.3.2.  Resulting  lessons-learned  need  to  be  addressed  in  order  for  progression  (filling  gaps and  shortfalls)  of  the  installation‘s  capabilities  to  occur.    Further  guidance  on  training  and exercises is available in AFI 10-2501.   52  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Chapter 3 RESPONSE 3.1.  Response  Overview.  An  objective  of  conventional  or  irregular  CBRNE  response preparations is to establish an installation CBRNE and hazardous materials (HAZMAT) response team  framework  made  up  of  various  functional  areas  from  the  first  responder  and  emergency responder  communities.    An  installation,  therefore,  must  identify  its  capabilities  by  functional area  in  order  to  respond  to  conventional  or  irregular  CBRNE  attacks.    These  capabilities  and response teams will be the catalyst for protecting personnel and ensuring the installation is able to continue or restore critical mission operations. 3.2.  CBRNE  Operational  Standards  and  Enabling  Tasks.  The  AF  conducts  operations  in both  mature  and  austere  theaters  of  operation.    CBRNE  defense  TTPs  must  be  flexible  and adaptable to varied basing realities.  Forces located in or deployed to mature theaters primarily operate from existing main or collocated operating bases.  Main operating bases normally have an  established  support,  manpower,  and  facility  infrastructure.    Collocated  operating  bases  may have an established support and facility infrastructure, but portions of the infrastructure may be in caretaker versus operational status at the time of U.S. force arrival.  Forces deployed to austere regions  or  to  recently  re-occupied  areas  may  find  airbases  without  pre-existing  support  and facility  infrastructure.    In  addition,  hostile  action  or  civil  unrest  may  damage  or  destroy  the installation infrastructure before the arrival of United States forces.  CBRNE Defense Enabling Tasks are defined in Table 3.1 Table 3.1.  CBRNE Defense Enabling Tasks Installation Level Unit Level Maintain installation security and physical integrity.  Maintain control of resources through the Recognize attack initiation and protect personnel, weapon systems, and material from weapon effects. Generate and sustain critical missions in CBRNE environments. Complete tactical, strategic, and aeromedical airlift movement. Care for and evaluate medical casualties. Leader or Supervisor Level Lead people and manage resources. Maintain unit cohesion and focus. Control forces through the crisis action team, emergency operations center, or unit control center. Conduct action drills for likely attack scenarios. Ensure people are trained in CBRNE defense knowledge and tasks. unit control center and work centers. Develop threat-based plans, standard operating procedures, and checklists. Ensure CBRNE defense equipment is available and serviceable. Maintain individual and team training proficiency. Expeditionary Airman Level Understand the nature of CBRNE warfare. Prepare for and survive CBRNE attacks. Identify, avoid, mark, and report hazards. Mitigate the effects of an attack, perform self-aid, and buddy care. Perform essential individual and collective tasks while wearing IPE. 3.2.1.  The  Air  Force  standards  for  mission  sustainment  and  mission  capability  restoration following chemical  attacks are summarized below.  Although specific standards are not  yet AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   53  established  for  mission  restoration  following  biological,  radiological,  or  conventional weapons attacks, commanders should use the wartime chemical  defense standards in  Table 3.2, as a guide to restore the mission.  AFI 10-2501 outlines the peacetime response enabling standards  and  proficiency  requirements.    It  also  includes  response  to  irregular  CBRNE attacks. Table 3.2.  Wartime Chemical Attack Standards AF Unit Conducting Combat Operations or in Support of Combat Operations Resume primary mission within 2 hours after the end of a chemical attack Support operational sustainment, in accordance with CEMP 10-2 for up to 96 hours Support operational sustainment by reducing contamination-related casualties to the lowest possible level AF Units Conducting Force Projection Operations in Support of Expeditionary Forces Resume primary mission capability within 6 hours after a chemical attack.  3.3.  Trigger Events.  See paragraph 2.2.12.5 for a description of trigger events.  The following information  describes  the  response  options  available  with  each  individual  trigger  event.  Response  to  this  type  of  trigger  event  could  involve  prophylaxis  medications,  vaccinations, further  sampling,  casualty  management,  and  public  affairs  actions  to  inform  the  public  and mitigate  panic.    The  mitigation  options  are  influenced  by  when  the  CBRNE  event  was discovered (e.g., the earlier in the trigger event process the event is discovered, the more options are  available  to  the  airbase.)    Table  3.3,  provides  an  illustrative  example  of  this  insofar  as biological events are concerned. Table 3.3.  Effective Biological Event Mitigation Options: Warning: Intelligence Trigger  Warning: Detector/Weapons Masking Medical Surveillance Environmental Sampling Physical Protection Collective Protection Refresher Training Prophylactic Vaccination Prophylactic Medicine Public Affairs Detector Sampling Supply Inventory Casualty Management  Trigger Masking Medical Surveillance Environmental Sampling Physical Protection Collective Protection Prophylactic Vaccination Prophylactic Medicine Detector Sampling Public Affairs Casualty Management   Warning: Sentinel Casualty Trigger Medicines Vaccinations Medical Surveillance Environmental Sampling Public Affairs Casualty Management   3.3.1.  Intelligence Warning.  This trigger affords the most response options after application of  permanent  and  routine  measures  to  decrease  vulnerability  and  continue  uninterrupted operations.  Since intelligence warning assumes prior knowledge, it allows a commander to   54  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 take  aggressive  actions  to  protect  personnel  and  resources,  and  to  tailor  the  response.    It allows  a  commander  to  apply  a  full  range  of  threat-based  options  from  the  use  of prophylaxis, to staged detection equipment, all the way to training or warning personnel. 3.3.2.  Weapon  Event  and/or  Detector  Alarm.    During  and  immediately  after  an  attack,  the top  priority  should  be  to  determine  whether  it  was  a  CBRN  attack.    Detection  and observation  prior  to  the  occurrence  of  casualties  will  prompt  the  initiation  of  protective actions, which are initially designed to preserve human life and protect critical resources. 3.3.3.  Sentinel Casualty.  Response actions based on a sentinel casualty may begin well into the  health  degradation  or  disease  progression  cycle.    Response  to  this  type  of  trigger  event could sampling,  casualty management, and public affairs actions to inform the public and mitigate panic.  Table  3.3, provides an illustrative example of biological events. involve  prophylaxis  medications,  vaccinations, further 3.4.  Response  Command  and  Control.  The  different  elements  of  the  CBRNE  defense organization that provide response C2 are defined in AFMAN 10-2502. 3.4.1.  Disaster Response Force (DRF).  The DRF is defined in AFI 10-2501.  It responds to, supports and performs CBRNE operations.  The DRF use AFIMS and the incident command system (ICS) in responding to CBRNE enemy attacks and terrorist use of CBRNE materials.  The Specialized teams, as defined in AFI 10-2501, are any teams that support the overall EM program. 3.4.1.1.  Crisis  Action  Team  (CAT).    The  CAT  is  directed  by  the  Installation Commander,  and  includes  the  Command  Post  (CP).    The  CAT  directs  strategic  actions supporting the installation‘s mission and response to incidents. 3.4.1.1.1.  The CP directs actions in support of the installation's assigned mission by functioning as the focal point for base-wide notification, warning and reporting.  CP staff responsibilities are listed in Table 3.4 Table 3.4.  CP Staff Responsibilities Maintaining notification rosters and notifying members and elements not on the secondary crash net. Activating of the INWS. Briefing the CAT and Commanders Senior Staff on the status of operations. Disseminating information to, and collecting information from the EOC. Coordinating response support requirements, coordinating external specialized teams, and coordinating with civil and governmental authorities. 3.4.1.2.  Emergency Operations Center.  The EOC is the C2 support element that directs, monitors,  and  supports  the  installation‘s  response  actions  before,  during  and  after  an incident.    The  EOC  updates  the  CAT  with  ongoing  incident  status  reports  and  seeks support  through  the  CAT  when  on-scene  requirements  surpass  the  installation‘s capability.    The  EOC  and  the  CAT  will  coordinate  planning,  response,  and  recovery efforts.  The EOC is not typically manned on a 24/7 basis but is activated as needed.  The EOC does not  have to  be fully manned in  order  to  begin  communicating with  the CAT (key communication should not be delayed). AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   55  3.4.1.2.1.  Emergency  Support  Functions  (ESF).    ESF  capabilities,  as  stated  in  the National  Response  Framework  (NRF),  are  grouped  into  an  organizational  structure that  provides  support,  resources  and  services  that  are  needed  during  an  incident.  ESFs serve as the primary operational level mechanism for incident resource support.  While not all ESF members may be required in the early phases of the response, they can  provide  valuable  advice  and  assistance  in  the  myriad  of  tasks  and  begin coordinating activities regarding recovery and restoration resources. 3.4.1.3.  National-level responders, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Department of Energy (DOE) may not be immediately available to respond to an installation‘s needs. 3.4.1.4.  Installation  planners  and  responders  must  be  prepared  to  conduct  the  initial, advanced,  and  mission  continuation  response  operations  until  additional  assets  are available.    Installations  must  plan  for  a  large-scale  CBRNE  incident  or  attack  response based on organic resources and mutual aid. 3.4.1.5.  The  response  shifts  to  recovery  and  restoration  as  the  immediate  hazard  is mitigated.  ESF planning and coordination determines the length and extent of recovery and restoration. 3.4.1.6.  CBRN  Control  Center.    The  CBRN  Control  Center  is  managed  under  ESF  5, Emergency  Management.    The  control  center  is  subordinate  to  the  EOC  director  and serves as an advisory element to the EOC and the Installation Commander.  The control center  directs  CBRN  reconnaissance  activities  to  shape  the  hazards  and  advises  the commander  on  hazards,  countermeasures  and  protective  actions.    The  CBRN  Control Center  plots  and  maintains  CBRN  hazards  status  on  the  airbase,  in  off-base  areas  of operational  concern  and  at  potential  recovery  bases.    The  CBRN  Control  Center  also conducts  CBRN  and  release  other  than  attack  (ROTA)  plotting  and  reporting  activities IAW  NATO  Standardization  Agreement  (STANAG)  2103,  Allied  Tactical  Publication (ATP) 45, NATO Reporting Nuclear Detonations, Biological and Chemical Attacks and Predicting  and  Warning  of  Associated  Hazards  and  Hazard  Areas,  or  IAW  MAJCOM guidance.  The guidance from STANAG 2103 and ATP 45 is embedded in AFTTP (I) 3-2.56.  These activities facilitate force survivability and mission continuation for forces on and  off  the  installation,  both  in  the  hazard  area  and  in  the  downwind  hazard  area.    The CBRN  Control  Center  manages  Shelter  Management  Team  (SMT),  CCA  and  CCT operations  and  supports  installation  warning  and  reporting  and  operations  with  United States  joint  service,  coalition  and  host  nation  forces.    CBRN  Control  Center  personnel coordinate  with  bioenvironmental,  medical,  weather,  and  intelligence  representatives  to provide  advice  to  the  commander.    The  control  center  may  include  host  nation  CBRN defense specialists and may provide reciprocal manning at the host nation control center. 3.4.1.7.  UCCs  provide  mission  support  to  the  Incident  Commander  as  directed  by  the EOC  and  to  the  Installation  Commander  as  directed  by  the  CAT.    The  EOC  and  CAT resolve any conflicting requirements.  UCCs provide a focal point within an organization to maintain unit C2, relay information to and from unit personnel, provide expertise to the EOC or Incident Commander, and leverage unit resources to respond to and mitigate the incident.   56  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 3.4.1.7.1.  UCCs  maintain  a  base  map  with  unit  areas  of  responsibility,  structures, shelters, bunkers, and primary operating areas marked to enable quick identification. 3.4.1.7.2.  UCC  checklists  outline  tasks  and  responsible  unit  functions  under  each alarm and FPCON condition. 3.4.1.7.3.  The UCC directs  PAR operations,  reports  attack hazards,  and  coordinates recovery actions.  Large units or those with widely separate functions may designate unit work centers or sub-control centers to assist with UCC responsibilities. 3.4.1.7.4.  UCCs track the location of all known attack hazards that may  affect  their unit‘s  personnel  or  mission.    This  includes  hazards  such  as  contamination  and unexploded  ordnance.    The  UCC  advises  unit  personnel  of  hazard  locations  and directs  the  movement  of  unit  assets  away  from  hazard  areas.    The  UCC  tracks  the alarm  condition  and  IPE  for  each  CBRN  zone  and  controls  movement  of  unit resources into and out of contaminated areas. 3.4.1.7.5.  Establish/Activate  Primary  and  Alternate  Unit  Control  Centers.    Each primary  unit  control  center  must  have  the  capability  to  function  from  an  alternate location.    For  irregular  warfare  activities,  units  should  strive  to  establish  their alternate unit control center at a site that is unlikely to be included in the same hazard cordon affecting the primary location. 3.5.  Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS).  AFI 10-2501 requires every AF installation to have a rapid and effective system to disseminate emergency information.  INWS includes  signals  or  messaging  appropriate to  FPCON,  Defense  Readiness  Conditions (DEFCON),  Alarm  Signals,  MOPP  levels,  watches,  warnings,  evacuation  routes,  and  other alerting  information  to  meet  DOD  and  federal  warning  requirements.    Installations  should incorporate all available resources to provide warning, which may include cable override, reverse 911,  or  a  Network  Broadcast  System.    All  required  incorporated  resources  compose  the  AF INWS. 3.5.1.  Each AF installation‘s CEMP 10-2 will identify the notification and warning system capabilities specific to their location. 3.5.2.  Air Force Visual  Aid (AFVA) 10-2511, USAF Standardized Attack Warning Signals for NBCC Medium and High Threat Areas.  AFVA 10-2511 provides specific attack warning signals  for  areas  subject  to  CBRNE  combined  weapons  attacks  during  contingency  or wartime operations. 3.5.3.  Alarm Signals.  Commanders use AF standardized warning signals to posture airbases for  attacks,  warn  of  attacks  in  progress,  initiate  attack  recovery  actions,  and  return  the  air-base to a state of readiness.  Warning signals quickly communicate commanders' intentions, direct personnel and units to take planned, phased defense actions, or notify everyone to take cover.    Although  warning  signals  are  primarily  designed  to  provide  warning  of  aircraft, missile, ground attack, and indirect  fire  (IDF) to  include rockets,  artillery, and mortar, they may  be  used  to  warn  of  covert  chemical,  biological,  and/or  radiological  weapons  attacks.  Warning signals must be adapted to the environment to ensure they are effective because of inherent  difficulties  to  communicate  within  high  noise  areas,  at  night,  and  during  bad weather.    Therefore,  it  is  crucial  that  once  a  warning  has  been  issued  the  personnel  who received  the  warning  pass  the  information  along  to  other  affected  personnel  IAW  local AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   57  procedures  via  one  or  more  sources.    For  example,  aircrew  members  who  receive  warning while  inside  the  aircraft  should  execute  their  pre-planned  actions,  and  alert  passengers  and ground support personnel. 3.5.3.1.  Alarm Green and Alarm Yellow.  This is a preparedness notification indicating that  attack  is  possible.    It  signals  a  level  of  heightened  awareness  above  normal operations.  The enemy must have the means and intention of attacking your installation to  make  the  recommendation  to  declare  Alarm  Green.   Normally,  installation commanders will base their decision on advice provided by intelligence.  The Combatant commanders may also direct alarm declarations.  If a CBRN threat exists and the onset of hostilities  appears  imminent,  MOPP  2  is  the  minimum  level  of  protection  required.  However,  if  the  threat  of  hostilities  is  not  pressing,  MOPP  0  is  the  normal  MOPP declaration  associated  with  Alarm  Green  preparedness  activities.    Alarm  Yellow  is established generally when an attack is expected within 30 minutes or less.  This allows forces to take protective actions. 3.5.3.2.  Alarm  Red.    This  response  attack  alarm  means  the  attack  is  imminent  or  in progress.  During Alarm Red, a wavering tone will sound and a voice announcement will be made over the notification system to alert installation personnel of the type of attack.  The warning will be for an air attack, either from missiles or aircraft, or from ground or SOF forces.  Note:  Alarm Blue in Korea. 3.5.3.2.1.  During  Alarm  Red  air  attack,  the  primary  response  action  is  for  most personnel  to  take  cover.    Command  and  control  personnel  working  in  hardened facilities  should  continue  operations  to  maintain  situational  awareness  and  direct forces appropriately.  The commander should inform the base populace what type of attack is taking place. 3.5.3.2.2.  During Alarm Red Bugle Call.  The bugle call is used to notify the entire base populace that a ground or SOF attack is imminent or in progress.  Notification is a bugle tone or voice announcement.  Response actions  are to  don helmet  and body armor and take defensive positions behind cover, prepare to defend oneself and one‘s position, and watch for security forces.  Remain in position until ―ALARM GREEN‖ or  ―ALL  CLEAR‖  is  declared.    Movement  is  normally  authorized  only  for  on-duty security  forces  responding  IAW  directions  from  the  BDOC  Defense  Force Commander to the EOC Director. 3.5.3.3.  Alarm Black.   Alarm Black is  the attack recovery alert to  indicate the attack is over, and CBRNE contamination, UXO, and other hazards are suspected or present.  This condition also indicates base recovery actions.  Once in Alarm Black, the EOC director will look for inputs of hazards resulting from post-attack reconnaissance.  This is a base-wide effort with an integrated network of UCCs, shelters, and specialized teams reporting information  to  the  EOC.    Recovery  operations,  such  as  firefighting,  casualty  treatment, UXO  render  safe  actions,  airfield  damage  repair,  and  facility  restoration  should  begin after complete deposition or mission priorities have been considered. 3.5.3.4.  Provide  Visual  Aids  and  Current  Information  IAW  CEMP  10-2.    The effectiveness  of installation warnings is  directly related to  how well it is advertised and trained.    For  example,  displaying  warning  signal  visual  aids  in  all  work  centers  and common  use  areas  (such  as  billeting  tents,  post  offices,  latrines,  dining  facilities,  and   58  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 recreation  areas)  increases  the  probable  effectiveness  of  issued  warnings  by  increasing familiarity  with  the  various  meanings  of  the  warnings.    In  addition,  upon  arrival  of  all permanent party and transient personnel the installation should provide a handout of local warning  signals  and  associated  protective  action  information.    Transient  personnel include  aircrew,  passengers,  noncombatants,  and  all  other  personnel  not  assigned  to  the airbase. 3.5.3.5.  As  appropriate  for  the  coalition  and/or  host  nation  forces,  installations  should consider developing multilingual visual aids and public address systems  announcements to ensure the broadest receipt of installation warnings.  Installations should also include preparing  warning  procedure  handouts  for  geographically  separated  units  and  enemy prisoners of war. 3.5.3.6.  Local  Variations.    Commanders  are  authorized  wide  latitude  in  determining warning signals and are authorized to overprint the standard AF visual aids to incorporate local  information.    This  may  include  changes  in  alarm  color  codes  (consistent  with theater  guidance),  audible  signals,  or  supplemental  information  to  respond  to  specific weapons or threats. 3.5.3.7.  Commanders declare alarm conditions to initiate passive defense actions.  Alarm conditions, combined with supplemental instructions through the chain of command, are the  most  effective  way  to  establish  the  defensive  posture  of  an  airbase.    When  CBRN threats  are  present,  the  commander  directs  MOPP  levels  or  variations  to  provide individual protection for the current mission and situation. 3.5.3.8.  Commanders may direct mission-essential tasks or functions to continue during any  alarm  condition.    Mission  requirements  may  require  commanders  to  accept  an increased risk of casualties or contamination. 3.5.3.9.  Indirect  Fire Alarm Signals.    Indirect  fire alarm signals  are used to  notify base personnel in the immediate area of an indirect fire (IDF) attack.  Notification is a Klaxon tone, voice announcement or unexplained explosion.  Response actions are immediately to  lay  face  down  protecting  eyes  and  ears.    After  2  minutes  from  the  last  known explosion,  personnel  move  to  cover  until  the  nature  of  the  explosion  is  determined  or ―ALARM GREEN/ALL CLEAR‖ is declared.  While moving to cover, personnel survey the  area  for  injured  personnel  and  UXOs.    If  the  installation  does  not  possess  IDF detection  and  warning  capability  (Counter-Rocket,  Artillery  and  Mortar  (C-RAM) system), then Alarm Red is appropriate for an IDF attack.  The declaration of MOPP 0 is normally appropriate for this alarm signal. 3.5.3.9.1.  Installations  with  C-RAM  capability:  Transition  from  Alarm  Green  to Klaxon is automated.  SME: Security Forces. 3.5.3.9.2.  Installations  with  C-RAM  capability:  Transition  from  Alarm  Green  to Alarm  Red  may  be  accomplished  from  the  BDOC  or  Command  Post  once  attack  is imminent or in progress. 3.5.3.9.3.  Installations  with  or  without  C-RAM  capability:  Transition  from  Alarm Red  to  Alarm  Black  with  approval  from  installation  leadership.    SME:  Emergency Management. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   59  3.5.3.9.4.  Installations  with  or  without  C-RAM  capability:  Transition  from  Alarm Black to Alarm Green with approval from installation  leadership.  SME: Emergency Management. 3.5.4.  CBRN  and  Force  Protection  Condition  (FPCON)  Relationships.    CBRNE  protective actions can have a direct correlation with Force Protection Conditions at an installation when there is a threat of a terrorist attack using CBRNE materials.  These protective actions are to be used in conjunction with the appropriate FPCON measures.  As the FP level increases, the installation  will  initiate  CBRNE  protective  measures  identified  in  CEMP  10-2  FPCON CBRN  measures  and  AFI  10-245.    Some  of  these  actions  could  include  inspecting mechanical rooms for suspect packages, putting out CBR detectors around critical  facilities, issuing medical prophylaxis, or issuing IPE to key and essential personnel. 3.5.5.  Defense Readiness Conditions (DEFCON) and States and Stages of Alert.  The U.S. Armed Services and allies respond to the increased threat of enemy nation-state attacks in a methodical  manner  commensurate  with  the  situation.    For  comparison  sake,  the  concept  is similar  to  the  use  of  the  FPCONs  to  prepare  for  potential  terrorist  attacks.    The  DEFCON system  is  used  within  the  United  States  and  at  some  locations,  OCONUS  to  accomplish preparatory  actions,  and  different  States  and  Stages  of  Alert  are  used  within  the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  Table 3.5, summarizes the progressive postures used between the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the commanders of Unified Commands. Table 3.5.  Description of Defense Readiness Conditions DEFCON LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF DEFENSE READINESS CONDITIONS 5 4 3 2 1 This is the condition used to designate normal peacetime military readiness.   This refers to normal, increased intelligence and the heightening of national security measures. This refers to an increase to force readiness above normal.  Note:  DEFCON 3 was declared during the September 11, 2001 attacks. This refers to a further increase in force readiness just below maximum readiness.  Note:  The most notable time this level was declared was during the Cuban Missile Crisis, although the declaration was limited to the Strategic Air Command. This refers to maximum readiness. 3.5.5.1.  Each State and Stage of Alert has a separate name, and in some cases the name itself is classified.  These are used in the same concept as DEFCONs (e.g., higher levels are declared as the threat increases).  Both systems (DEFCONs and States and Stages of Alert)  have  individual  measures  associated  with  each  level.    These  measures  have specific  timelines  associated  with  their  completion.    Unless  specifically  omitted  by  the declaration  authority,  some  are  required  to  be  accomplished  immediately  upon  the declaration of the respective DEFCON/State and Stage of Alert, some are required to be completed within four hours of the declaration, etc.  Note:  Unless specifically omitted by the  declaration  authority,  all  measures  that  were  not  accomplished  from  a  lower DEFCON/State and Stage of Alert, become due immediately upon the declaration of the next higher level.   60  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 3.5.5.2.  Normally  classified,  the  completion  of  individual  measures  associated  with DEFCONs/States  and  Stages  of  Alert  is  reported  from  the  unit  level  to  a  centralized installation  report  collection  function,  and  when  all  units  are  complete  with  a  specific measure or group of measures, from the installation to the next higher level of command.  When  the  threat  decreases  and  lower  DEFCON/State  and  Stage  of  Alert  levels  are  re-instituted,  installations  and  individual  units  must  be  careful,  for  Operations  Security (OPSEC)  purposes,  during  the  drawdown  activities  not  to  highlight  exactly  which preparatory items were associated with the specific DEFCONs/States and Stages of Alert. 3.5.6.  Higher Headquarters Reporting.  See AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, Figure 3.6., for  the  Operational  Report  (OPREP)-3  submission  requirements  outside  of  the  Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Warning and Reporting System (NBCWRS).  Figure 3.6., of AFI 10-206  is  entitled  Guide  for  Reporting  Suspected  or  Confirmed  Terrorist  use  of  Chemical, Biological, or Radiological (CBR) Materials, and contains 21 desired report line items.  See AFTTP  3-2.56  and  North  American  Aerospace  Defense  Command  Instruction  10-22, Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical  Warning and  Reporting System, for higher headquarters reporting NBCWRS.  https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/DocMan/DOCMain.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-52&FolderID=OO-EN-CE-52-7-25&Tab=0. requirements within the 3.6.  First  and  Emergency  Responders’  Missions.  The  First  and  Emergency  Responders‘ Missions outline the basic tactical functions evaluated and implemented during conventional and irregular incidents.  These missions recognize that a majority of incidents are minor in nature and the missions should be used as flexible guidance.  It allows for expansion as the incident grows in scope.  It also builds on the action of the first responding units and facilitates identifying the roles  and  responsibilities  at  each  level  of  response.    First  and  Emergency  Responder  missions provide  a  consistent  management  structure.    Not  all  missions  may  be  used  in  sequence.    For example,  mission  8  ―Establish  Hazard  Control  Zones‖  is  considered  ―identifying  the  CBRN zones,‖ and those zones won‘t  be identified until the problem (chemical  agent  or other hazard) has been identified and preliminary identification of risks and hazards has been initiated.  When responding to an irregular attack during peacetime or non-wartime operations all missions could be followed in  sequence.  Under each mission, each first  and emergency  responder  agency has identified  mission  capabilities  they  provide  in  response  to  a  conventional  or  irregular  CBRNE attack  and  a  HAZMAT  incident.    These  mission  capabilities  include:  the  mission,  description, standards,  personnel  requirements  and  position  descriptions,  role  and  responsibility  references, and tables, which are defined in Attachment 3. 3.7.  Conventional  CBRNE  Attack  Response.  The  AF  has  a  single  integrated,  interoperable structure for supporting or conducting CBRNE response operations.  During conventional attack response operations, commanders determine what actions are executable based upon prevention and recovery attack threat assessments, availability of resources, and mission needs.  Airmen and leaders implement attack response actions to limit contamination.  They perform immediate and operational  decontamination  and  rapid  post-attack  reconnaissance  to  detect,  identify,  and segregate contaminated resources and areas.  C2 of the response to a terrorist or enemy attack is a challenge requiring a unified framework to prepare and execute plans and orders.  Control of attack response actions must be flexible to address all capabilities and resources across the AF.  An effective C2 system supports military and civilian operations and ensures effective response operations.    During  combined  operations  (i.e.,  the  AF  working  with  other  services  and  civilian AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   61  agencies) the AF installation commander retains responsibility for military forces and on-going military operations.  During attack response operations, commanders determine what actions are executable  based  upon  capability  assessments.    Refer  to  Attachment  5  for  CBRNE  response decision tools that will support attack response operations. 3.7.1.  Commander‘s Considerations.  If an attack is imminent, the commander must initiate notification of the base populace of the type of attack, estimated time of attack (e.g.3 minutes out),  initiate  alarm  signals  based  on  the  type  of  attack,  and  protective  actions  and  MOPP.  The commander must be aware of critical missions that will take place after the attack.  This awareness of mission criticality will  allow the commanders to  establish recovery objectives based  on  the  type  of  attack,  contamination  levels,  risks  to  personnel  and  the  damages incurred.  The commander must consider protective actions for personnel and critical assets.  Are there adequate aircraft shelters or hangar space to house and protect aircraft?  Are there adequate  shelters  for  personnel  and  do  they  include  collective  protection  systems?    Is  the notification  and  warning  system  working  and  is  it  capable  of  reaching  everyone  on  the installation?    Is  the  attack  warning  system  adequate  and  does  it  provide  advance  warning?  Are there adequate medical supplies and prophylaxis available? 3.7.1.1.  Identify  and  provide  collective  protection  spaces  for  in-place  and  deployed  Air Force personnel  as  required by theater or MAJCOM  guidance.    If theater or MAJCOM guidance is not provided, plan to provide rest and relief collective protection for at least 30  percent  of  the  force,  and  toxic  free  area  rest  and  relief  for  at  least  20  percent  of  the force  per  shift.    Use  any  combination  of  Class  I-IV  transportable,  fixed  facility,  or expedient collective protection systems.  Include additional space, if required, to protect transient aircrew and passengers.  For planning, assume collective protection shelters and toxic  free  areas  used  for  rest  and  relief  will  operate  two  12-hour  shifts  and  provide  the capability to protect at least 50 percent (30 percent with collective protection, 20 percent with toxic free areas) of the airbase population per shift.  See Attachment 4 for all other collective protection requirements.  Consider adding additional capability to account for system attritions.  Plan to sustain this capability for up to 96 hours (continuous or 12-hour segments) within a 30-day period. 3.7.1.2.  Implement  MOPP  operations  based  upon  the  current  threat.    Consult  with Emergency Management and Medical personnel to determine the projected MOPP, work-rest  cycles,  and  hydration  standards  for  the  next  24-hour  period.    Notify  the  base populace  and  re-evaluate  every  12  hours  or  when  climatic  conditions  significantly change.  Determine the need for MOPP options and direct them when appropriate.  Based upon  threat,  direct  personnel  to  wear  field  gear  and  personal  body  armor  (if  issued)  in addition  to  the  current  MOPP.    On  a  case-by-case  basis,  delegate  MOPP  authority  to subordinate commanders. 3.7.1.3.  Use  all  available  facility  overhead  cover,  hardened  facilities,  revetments,  and berms.    Prioritize  use  of  facility  overhead  cover  for  mission  critical  assets  (aircraft, munitions,  aerospace  ground  equipment,  fire  trucks,  and  POL  vehicles).    Develop procedures  to  identify  empty  shelters  or  facilities  with  overhead  cover  for  use  as temporary protection when they are not in use to protect the primary assets. 3.7.1.4.  Implement standard operating procedures to protect tactical aircraft, large-frame aircraft,  and  passengers.    Ensure  procedures  include  methods  to  notify  aircrew  and   62  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 passengers  of  airbase  alarm  conditions  and  MOPP  level  prior  to  aircraft  arrival,  during aircraft taxi, and during ground transfer to and from the aircraft. 3.7.1.5.  Consider  the  mission  priorities,  threat,  and  warning  timeline  and  direct appropriate actions.    Identify  critical  tasks and  missions to  either continue or terminate.  Terminate routine or non-critical operations and direct units to implement the appropriate pre-planned actions. 3.7.1.6.  The  installation  commander  may  direct  mission  essential  activities  to  continue during  attacks.    The  importance  of  these  missions  should  justify  the  increased  risk  to personnel  and  resources.    Examples  include  mission  continuation  and  sortie  generation, aircraft  launch  or  recovery,  medical,  EOD,  fire  fighting,  or  airbase  defense  operations.  Essential  activities may  also  include the safe termination of in-progress  operations such as aircraft and bulk storage POL transfers, weapons loading, aeromedical evacuation, and air traffic control operations. 3.7.2.  Standard Response Actions for all CBRN Attacks. 3.7.2.1.  Initial Actions.  When an attack warning (Alarm Red) is declared, all personnel assume  the  appropriate  MOPP  and  take  protective  actions.    Once  the  attack  is  over, commanders decide when and how they wish to release the CBRN reconnaissance teams, Airfield  Damage  Assessment  Teams,  Post-Attack  Reconnaissance  (PAR)  teams  and  the base  population  from  their  protected  positions.    Commanders  should  consider  the following  when making  this decision:  the potential  type of warhead, mission criticality, base populace actions, and the protective actions implemented. 3.7.2.1.1.  Type of Warhead.  When chemical warfare agents delivered by TBMs are involved,  the  liquid  contamination  may  take  up  to  60  minutes  to  settle  completely when airburst warheads are employed.  The rate of the chemical droplet fall phase is not  linear  (see  Figure  3.1).    The  figure  shows  the  behavior  of  a  specific  TBM detonated in air.  By comparison, for the same chemical-filled TBM that detonates via a ground burst mechanism, the chemical droplet fall phase will last approximately 3 minutes.  When a bomb from an aircraft is used to deliver CB agents the amount of agent  and  the  area  contaminated  is  much  smaller  and  will  have  less  affect  on  the installation.  In addition, the droplet fall phase will be shorter.   Effective increasing risking  people‘s  health  and risk  management  would  preclude 3.7.2.1.2.  Mission  Criticality. unnecessarily the  probability  of personnel/resource  contamination  for  accomplishing  routine  activities  that  can  be delayed.    If  the  next  critical  mission  activity  is  not  scheduled  for  an  hour  or  more, commanders  can  have  personnel  remain  inside  their  protective  positions,  thereby reducing the risk of direct liquid chemical agent exposure to the people.  If sufficient time  does  not  exist  to  allow  the  chemical  droplet  fall  phase  to  finish,  delaying  the release of personnel for even a few minutes will potentially make a large difference in the  number  of  people  and  resources  that  become  contaminated.    The  ESF representatives  in  the  EOC  analyze  the  attack  results  and  determines  what  CBRN zones are  affected.   Following the attack analysis and mission assessment,  the EOC will notify the base populace and UCCs of the commander‘s decision.  For example, the decision may be Alarm Green, MOPP 4 in zones 1, 2, 4, and 7; and Alarm Green, MOPP 2 for the remainder of the installation. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   63  Figure 3.1.  Estimated VX Liquid Agent Deposition Time Following a SCUD Airburst Warhead Detonation 250 Meters (820 feet) Above Ground Level  3.7.2.1.3.  Base  Populace  Actions.    Personnel  that  work  inside  facilities  or  other structures  that  provide  complete  overhead  cover  should  begin  mission  activities immediately when Alarm Black is declared. 3.7.2.1.4.  Protective  Actions.    In  a  chemical  or  biological  attack  it  is  critical  to protect equipment and personnel as much as possible.  How effective an installation can  protect  equipment  and  personnel  will  affect  how  quickly  the  installation  can recover  and  continue  operations.    If  the  majority  of  equipment  is  put  under  cover (either inside a facility or covered with plastic) the less operational decontamination personnel will have to conduct on the equipment and the faster it can be put into use.  If  personnel  are  put  under  cover  and  the  longer  they  remain  under  cover  then  the numbers  of  personnel  requiring  decontamination  will  be  reduced  as  well  as  all  the resources needed to operate a CCA. 3.7.2.1.5.  Response  Teams  Actions.    In  a  chemical  attack  situation  the  release  time after  attack  does  not  impact  the  likely  mission  results  of  the  CBRN  reconnaissance teams  and  Airfield  Damage  Assessment  Teams  (ADAT),  but  it  does  impact  the probability of success associated with PAR teams.  The CBRN reconnaissance teams will likely find evidence of chemical contamination whenever air burst munitions are involved,  and  the  ADAT  will  be  able  to  determine  the  serviceability  of  the  aircraft operating  surfaces  and  support  infrastructure,  regardless  of  when  they  are  released from  their  protection  positions.    However,  the  initial  reconnaissance  results  may  be erroneous  or  incomplete  if  the  PAR  teams  are  released  and  begin  reporting  results before  the  vast  majority  of  the  chemical  cloud  has  settled.    Consequently, commanders  normally  choose  to  stagger  the  release  of  the  CBRN  reconnaissance teams/ADATs in comparison to when they release the PAR teams.

The same principle of a staggered release mechanism between CBRN reconnaissance teams  and  the  base  populace  also  applies  to  biological,  radiological,  and  TIC scenarios.    In  these  cases,  the  CBRN  reconnaissance  teams  possess  appropriate detectors  for  these  materials  but  the  base  populace  does  not.    Consequently,  the staggered  release  of  the  base  populace  is  protective  in  nature  for  these  people  as opposed to enhancing the effectiveness of detection activities.  CBRN reconnaissance teams will not need to canvas the detection grid for nuclear fallout since the detectors will  register  the  presence  of  the  high  levels  of  radiation  from  inside  protective shelters. 3.7.2.2.  Each  UCC  is  responsible  for  controlling  their  forces  and  limiting  movement between contaminated and non-contaminated zones in the aftermath of the attack.  Unless otherwise directed by their UCC or other authority, individuals are expected to remain in a  shelter  or  under  overhead  cover.    When  contamination  is  present  on  the  airbase  and movement  is  required,  individuals  do  not  move  between  zones  without  direction  from their UCCs or approval from other authority. 3.7.2.3.  Release  of  Personnel.    Phased  release  of  personnel  normally  applies  to conventional CBRNE attacks.  Following an enemy attack, teams and personnel will be released  during  Alarm  Black  in  phases  to  perform  mission  continuation  tasks.    These teams include CBRN reconnaissance, airfield damage assessment, PAR, security forces, fire  emergency  services,  medical  teams  and  base  populace  personnel.    Teams  and personnel  will  be  released  based  upon  the  tasks  they  are  required  to  perform  CBRNE detection  and  identification.    Installations  use  a  three  phase  process  in  releasing personnel.  The phases are initial release, limited release, and general release.  Release of CBRN  reconnaissance  teams/ADAT  is  conducted  during  Alarm  Black,  Initial  Release and PAR teams are released during Alarm Black, Limited Release and base populace are released during Alarm Black, General Release. 3.7.2.3.1.  Initial  Release.    Initial  release  is  established  for  CBRN  reconnaissance teams  and  ADAT  teams  to  be  released  from  their  staging  areas  upon  Alarm  Black announcement.  The CAT normally releases the CBRN reconnaissance team when the attack  is  over,  although  the  CBRN  hazards  have  probably  not  completed  the deposition  phase  at  this  time.    The  results  of  these  teams‘  efforts  allow  installation senior leaders to consider mission adjustments and procedures that might be required. 3.7.2.3.1.1.  ADAT.    The  ADAT  conducts  airfield  damage  assessment  to determine  airfield  operability  and  define  a  minimum  operation  strip  for installation  and  coalition  aircraft  to  maintain  operational  sortie  generation capability.    The  ADAT  is  normally  comprised  of  EOD  and  Engineer  Assistant team members. 3.7.2.3.1.2.  CBRN  Reconnaissance  Team. the  CBRN reconnaissance team is to determine and report if CBRN contamination is present on  the  installation.    They  accomplish  this  by  using  CBRN  equipment  to  include vapor,  liquid  and  solid  detection  techniques  along  pre-designated  routes.    This team  is  comprised  of  EM  personnel,  but  can  be  supplemented  by  BE  personnel upon request.   The  purpose  of AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   65  3.7.2.3.2.  Limited  Release.    PAR  teams  leave  their  protected  positions  and accomplish  chemical  detection  and  unexploded  ordnance  identification  within  their specified  area  upon  announcement  of  Alarm  Black,  Limited  Release.    The  CAT normally releases the PAR teams when most or all of the CBRN deposition phase is complete.    The  PAR  teams  delineate  the  extent  of  CBRN  contamination  on  the installation  and  discover  CBRNE  hazards  beyond  the  CBRN  reconnaissance  team routes.    The  consolidated  reports  from  the  PAR  teams  allow  the  senior  leaders  to make mission adjustments and decisions regarding split MOPP operations. 3.7.2.3.2.1.  PAR  Teams.    PAR  teams  are  organized,  trained,  and  equipped  by each unit that has been  assigned responsibilities  for a PAR sector.  This  team  is initially comprised of facility managers and other designated unit personnel.  The minimum  size  for  a  PAR  team  is  two  people.    This  enables  one  member  to maintain a constant watch for hazards, provide security, and call for assistance if accidents or injuries should  occur.  There is  no  maximum  number of PAR team members; however, team size should be kept to a minimum to reduce the number of  people  exposed  to  attack  hazards  and  still  accomplish  the  mission.    Larger teams  may  be  appropriate  depending  on  the  unit  mission,  weather,  security requirements,  or  size  of  the  area  to  be  surveyed.    PAR  teams  should  be knowledgeable  of  the  unit  area,  mission  and  assigned  equipment.    Installations must organize, train, and equip enough teams to enable a complete reconnaissance of  all  unit  areas  of  responsibility  within  15-20  minutes  after  the  initiation  of  the PAR  mission.    The  PAR  team  reports  to  their  assigned  facility  manager.    Local modification  is  authorized  and  encouraged  to  adapt  to  the  PAR  team‘s  specific circumstance.    Attachment  7  provides  recommended  checklists  for  all  PAR teams for most situations. 3.7.2.3.2.2.  Complete PAR Team Sweeps.  During attack recovery, detection and marking  of  contaminated  areas  reduces  the  inadvertent  spread  of  contamination, thereby reducing future decontamination operations.  The area of the hazard must be determined and marked to alert personnel and to define the limit of the hazard for follow-on remediation.  Contaminated areas should be marked and reported as soon as they are found. 3.7.2.3.3.  General  Release.    Mission  essential  personnel  leave  their  protected positions  to  accomplish  their  assigned  duties,  to  include  supporting  CBRNE reconnaissance,  upon  announcement  of  Alarm  Black,  General  Release.    The  CAT normally  releases  mission  essential  personnel  based  on  mission  requirements;  the ideal  situation  is  to  delay  this  release  until  the  CBRN  deposition  phase  and  PAR checks are complete.  The purpose of the base populace reconnaissance function is to identify CBRNE hazards within their capability and mark specific resources that have been  contaminated  and  report  the  results  to  their  UCC.    This  activity  allows individuals and the UCC to determine if uncontaminated assets are available for use and prioritize upcoming tasks. 3.7.2.4.  Ground Survey Assessment (Area Recon).  A ground survey assessment locates, detects  and  quantifies  the  levels  of  contamination  within  a  defined  area,  (e.g.,  airfield, taxiway,  industrial  area,  cordon)  using  methods  described  in  AFTTP  (I)  3-2.44, Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical   66  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Reconnaissance.    The  focus  is  to  locate  ground  and  surface  CBRN  contamination.    A secondary purpose is to detect aerosols and vapors.  Detailed hazards mapping is limited with this capability due to variances caused by winds and agent movement.  The focus is to  create  a  contamination  COP.    This  interacts  with  plume  modeling  from  the  CBRN Control  Center  to  ensure  a  more  complete  contamination  COP.    The  ground  survey provides  detailed  information  for  C2  decisions  in  developing  recovery  plans  and  IPE requirements.    The  type  of  CBRN  hazard  is  confirmed  prior  to  team  deployment.  Therefore, the teams will employ the specific CBRN hazard detection and quantification equipment. 3.7.2.5.  Damage Assessment. 3.7.2.5.1.  CBRNE  Aspects.    CE  must  dispatch  pre-identified  and  trained  damage assessment  teams  (DAT)  following  an  attack  to  assess  the  damage  and  impact  on critical  assets  and  infrastructure.    The  PAR  teams,  damage  assessment  teams,  and CBRN  reconnaissance  teams  assessing  the  base  for  damage,  contamination,  and UXOs  are  critical  in  providing  the  information  to  the  senior  leaders  to  size  up  the effects of the attack. 3.7.2.5.2.  Quick  initial  reconnaissance  will  allow  assessment  of  the  installation following  an  attack.    The  objective  of  rapid  field  damage  assessments  is  to  quickly obtain reliable information from a wide range of impacted entities on damage to the airfield,  facilities,  environment,  utilities  and  other  supportive  infrastructure,  and  the potential impacts of the damage. 3.7.2.5.3.  Specialized  teams  (EOD,  airfield  damage  assessment,  BE,  and  CBRN reconnaissance) may be directed to start operations immediately following the attack to  provide  senior  leadership  with  a  quick-look  assessment  of  airfield  status  and  the overall  post-attack  situation.    If  communications  fail,  commanders  may  also  direct specialized teams to "auto-roll" as soon as the attack is over. 3.7.2.5.4.  All  base  personnel  should  promptly  treat  and  report  casualties,  identify, report  and  mark  facility  damage,  suspected  contamination,  location  of  UXO,  and other problems to the CAT or EOC through their respective control centers. 3.7.2.6.  Whenever possible, the CAT or EOC should supplement attack warning signals with detailed attack information.  If available, provide the attack type (aircraft, missile, or ground  force),  expected  attack  location  (building,  sector,  or  zone),  and  time  remaining until  the  attack  begins.    Supplemental  information  enables  individuals  and  units  to execute the most effective protective actions and minimize mission degradation.  It also enables  the  airbase  to  tailor  actions  and  respond  to  simultaneous,  multiple  threats.    The CAT  or  EOC  should  not  delay  attack  warning  solely  to  include  supplemental information.  Likewise, individuals and units should not delay protective actions to wait for supplemental information.  React to alarm signal warnings immediately based on the information available. 3.7.3.  Chemical Attacks.  At present, the primary threat is from TBM warheads filled with a V-series nerve agent.  TBM warheads can be fused for either ground or airburst release.  The level of contamination achieved is greatly dependent upon the point of chemical release and type of agent contained in the warhead.  An enemy may target TBMs to deliver toxic agents AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   67  upwind of the installation or airbase.  Conditions most favorable for this are stable or neutral conditions  with  low  to  medium  winds  of  5-13  kilometers  per  hour  (kph).    Unfavorable conditions  for  downwind  movement  of  chemical  clouds  are  marked  air  turbulence,  winds above 13 kph, moderate to heavy rain, and an air stability category of ―unstable‖.  Use post-attack reconnaissance to determine what happened in an attack and direct protective actions. 3.7.3.1.  Characteristics  of  Chemical  Warfare  Agents.    Chemical  warfare  agents  usually sorb into porous airbase surfaces/materials within minutes and slowly evaporate releasing toxic chemical vapors over time.  While the presence of precipitation (natural or human-created) does not appear to affect the absorption of chemical agents into these materials, field  and  laboratory  testing  has  shown  that  the  introduction  of  light  precipitation  into  a contaminated  area  may  cause  a  small,  temporary  increase  in  vapor  production  and dilution  of  liquid  surface  contamination.    The  re-emergence  of  vapor  can  occur  many hours  after  the  cessation  of  initial  primary  vapor.    Vapor  levels  produced  by  this phenomenon  are  quantifiably  lower  than  initial  vapor  levels  detected  and  are  only expected to approach mild effects levels in the most heavily contaminated areas.  On dry asphalt  or  concrete  neat  or  thickened  agents  will  not  be  slung  off  of  aircraft  or  vehicle tires.  However, dilution of surface contamination may present a contact/ transfer hazard.  If  possible,  avoid  contact  with  standing  pools  of  water  or  visibly  wet  surfaces.    If unavoidable,  tires,  wheel  wells,  and  perhaps  the  extreme  underbelly  of  the  aircraft  and vehicles  may  contain  low  levels  of  contamination.    Nonetheless,  consider  this phenomenon when operating in contaminated areas.  Utilize the Hazard Duration Charts on  the  Air  Force  Emergency  Management  Portal  as  reference  for  estimated  persistency on various surfaces. 3.7.3.1.1.  Artillery shells, rockets, bombs,  grenades, mines, and missiles can release chemical  agents.    They  can  also  be  sprayed  from  air,  land,  and  water  vehicles  or covertly used to  contaminate food and water supplies.  The most likely  methods for chemical  agent  delivery  on  airbases  during  conventional  warfare  environments  are from  missile attack, and/or aircraft bomb  or spray  attack.  Other delivery means are possible, but they do not allow an adversary to place a militarily significant quantity of an agent on the airbase because of delivery system limitations or agent properties. 3.7.3.1.2.  Current  SOF  weapons  systems  are  unable  to  deliver  enough  of  these chemical  agents  to  achieve  effective  and  sustained  area  coverage.    Weapon  systems used  by  special  operations  forces  or  terrorists  are  poor  candidates  for  nerve  and/or blister  agent  dissemination.    The  use  of  blood  or  choking  agents  is  possible  but  not operationally feasible except for the purpose of disruption and terror. 3.7.3.1.3.  Warnings and Notifications.  A TBM launch may be detected by the USAF Space Command or by Patriot intercept detection radar systems.  If the installation is connected  to  a  theater  wide  warning  system,  the  installation  will  receive  warning through this system.  As soon as the CAT receives a warning the installation could be attacked  the  notification  should  go  out  to  the  entire  installation.    Base  alert  for  a chemical  attack  may  be  achieved  with  radio  communications,  Giant  Voice,  TV, Pigeon  e-mail,  or  flags.    Manual  systems  are  used  for  back-up  roles  and  to  expand coverage.  Alarm Red should be issued for the base populace. 3.7.3.1.3.1.  During  Alarm  Red,  the  primary  response  action  is  for  personnel  to   68  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 take  cover.    The  objective  is  to  link  the  declaration  with  Alarm  Yellow  actions whenever possible and time the notification so that people have time to complete last second contamination avoidance and mission critical activities prior to taking cover  in  the  most  sheltered  area  possible.    Command  and  control  personnel working  in  hardened  facilities  must  continue  operations  to  maintain  situational awareness and direct forces appropriately. 3.7.3.1.3.2.  Personnel  must  decide  whether  to  take  immediate  cover  or  reach adequate shelter.  Use ponchos, plastic sheets, or any expedient cover to minimize exposure to chemical agents if no overhead protection is available.  Personnel in vehicles should stop the vehicle; close the windows, hatches, and doors; and take cover  in  a  location  that  provides  both  overhead  cover  and  splinter  protection.  Personnel  don  their  masks  and  remaining  protective  gear  as  appropriate  after taking  cover.  All  but  the most mission essential functions cease.   All  personnel should  assume  MOPP  4  (full  IPE)  in  the  absence  of  any  other  information,  and remain  in  IPE  until  directed  to  reduce  the  MOPP  level.    Commanders  should consider going with full MOPP until they can gain more information on the type and extent of contamination.  The ultimate goal is to balance mission continuation with force survivability in order to maximize mission effectiveness. 3.7.3.1.4.  After the attack the installation commander will determine when personnel will be released and what teams will be released.  If there is a critical mission coming up,  then  a  quick  assessment  of  contamination  and  damage  will  need  to  be accomplished to determine what areas of the base are contaminated and damaged, so teams could be released 10 to 30 minutes after the attack.  The longer personnel are held under cover the less likely they will become contaminated from the chemical fall phase of a TBM attack. 3.7.3.1.5.  Mission  essential  teams  will  be  released  to  conduct  assessments  of  the installation.  These assessments will provide a preliminary determination of where the hazard areas are located or if there are any hazards. 3.7.3.1.6.  Once  the  assessment  of  contamination  and  runway  damage  has  been assessed  the  commander  will  determine  when  to  release  mission  essential  personnel to  conduct  mission  operations.    The  use  of  CBRN  zones  to  identify  contaminated areas is essential in disseminating quickly and easily hazard threat information to the base populace.  Once the commander has assessed the areas affected by the attack this information will be disseminated to the base populace and UCCs. 3.7.3.1.7.  The PAR teams will transmit any finding to their UCC, which will in turn send it to the EOC through the appropriate ESF.  Once this assessment is completed and  the  information  is  provided  to  the  EOC,  the  EOC  manager  will  provide  an assessment  to  the  EOC  director,  who  will  in  turn  brief  the  installation  commander.  The  installation  commander  will  determine  mission  critical  objectives  to  be accomplished during the recovery phase. 3.7.3.1.8.  The EOC Director will direct response and recovery operations as the area commander.    The  EOC  Director  would  base  the  response  and  recovery  objectives from  the  installation  commander‘s  priorities  based  on  mission  requirements.    The AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   69  EOC  Director  will  determine  which  emergency  essential  teams  must  be  released  in order to continue mission operations. 3.7.4.  Biological  Attack.    A  biological  warfare  (BW)  attack  is  the  deliberate  release  of biological  agents  to  cause  illness  or  death  in  people,  animals,  or  plants  and  can  result  in contaminated  food,  water,  equipment,  and  supplies.    The  Defense  Intelligence  Agency estimates  that  more  than  ten  countries  have  active  BW  programs.    A  number  of  other countries  have  the  infrastructure,  technical  expertise,  and  the  degree  of  secrecy  needed  to create  biological  agents.    Some  have  achieved  weaponization,  and  others  will  attain  that status  very  soon.    Concerns  relating  to  potential  military  use  of  biological  warfare  agents focus  primarily  on  Russia,  because  of  its  heritage  of  an  extensive  Soviet-era  BW  program.  China,  Syria,  and  Iran  have  identifiable  offensive  BW  programs  and  North  Korea  is suspected  of  having  a  BW  program.    A  biological  attack  may  come  with  no  warning  (i.e., upwind aerosol  release)  due to  the difficulty in  detecting and  correctly assessing the use of biological  agents.  Personnel should treat  a suspected biological attack just as they would a chemical  attack.    Since  it  is  difficult  to  readily  detect  and  determine  the  character  of  a particular biological attack (e.g., anthrax, smallpox, or botulism toxin), donning a well-fitting protective  mask  remains  the  best  method  to  enhance  the  survival  of  unvaccinated  forces.  Most biological agents have a delayed onset of signs or symptoms of a few days to a week—thus  hampering  identification,  complicating  personnel  decontamination,  and  delaying definitive treatment.  It is important to note that due to the nature of some biological agents, an attack could go unrecognized for a few weeks. 3.7.4.1.  Characteristics and Effects of Biological Agents. 3.7.4.1.1.  Biological  warfare  agents  consist  of  living  organisms  (pathogens)  or chemicals produced by organisms (toxins).  The ability of pathogens to replicate once disseminated,  means,  a  relatively  small  group  of  persons  (e.g.,  single  individuals deployed  in  a  military  staging  area)  could  ultimately  bring  about  the  infection  of  a large number of persons.  Some BW agents are difficult to detect and indications of a BW event will not occur until days or weeks later when personnel display symptoms.  Victims of primary exposure may not respond to treatment by the time a BW attack has been identified.  Some agents can become dormant, which can lead to long-term contamination.    Some  agents  are  delivered  in  a  dormant  form  that  can  persist  for months  in  the  environment  but  still  become  active  upon  entering  the  body.    The lethality of an agent, or the rate at which it kills its victims, has an obvious impact on force  protection  and  operations.    The  potency  of  an  agent  will  partially  dictate  the number  of  casualties  relative  to  agent  delivered.    Highly  infective  agents  are  more likely  to  cause  disease  because  fewer  particles  are  needed  to  cause  illness.    Lethal doses  are  dependent  on  particle  size:    particles  1-10  microns  in  size  can  reach  the lower lungs, and cause more severe illness. 3.7.4.1.2.  Most  BW  agents  can  be  produced  at  relatively  low  cost  and  can  be disseminated  through  low  technological  means,  although  the  production  of  reliable effective  agent  requires  a  quality  control  supporting  infrastructure  that  is  generally available  only  from  large  and  sophisticated  organizations.    Some  agents  kill  while others  incapacitate;  some  act  quickly  while  others  incubate  for  several  weeks;  and some  are  contagious  while  others  are  not.    The  devastation  a  BW  agent  will  cause depends on a number of variables.  Minor changes in any one variable can result in a   70  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 significant difference in the effectiveness of the attack, as well as in the effectiveness of the appropriate response. 3.7.4.2.  Response Actions.  If the attack(s) is detected (e.g., TBM, UAV, or aircraft) the installation  will  respond  as  for  a  chemical  attack.    Once  the  assessments  are  completed and chemical  agents  are  not  detected and there are no conventional  warheads on TBMs then an assessment for biological agents should be made.  If data can be retrieved on the location of the weapons detonation, this could provide approximated locations to conduct assessments.  The location of weapons detonations may be identified from radar, missile warning  systems,  Patriot  batteries,  or  eye  witness  accounts.    By  locating  a  detonation location the CBRN control center leverages the local Weather Flight (responsible for the region),  Air  Force  Weather  Agency,  or  Fleet  Numerical  Meteorological  and Oceanographic  Center  for  DOD-approved  real-time  and  high-resolution  forecast meteorological data files for use in computer modeling to provide a quick assessment of the  areas  potentially  affected  until  more  detailed  sampling  and  assessments  can  be conducted.    Should  contamination  be  suspected,  installation  personnel  operating  in  this location  would  have  to  operate  in  at  least  the  protective  mask  in  order  to  protect  the airways  of  personnel.    Refer  to  AFI  10-2604,  for  additional  BW  response  actions  and disease containment principles. 3.7.4.2.1.  During  the  assessment  process  Bioenvironmental  Engineering,  Public Health,  and  Emergency  Management  personnel  will  have  to  work  together  in gathering  information  and  conducting  area  surveys.    Public  Health  personnel  are essential in providing response and protective measures after a biological attack. 3.7.4.2.2.  Once  an  assessment  is  made  and  the  areas  of  possible  contamination  are identified  the  installation  commander  can  reduce  the  MOPP  level  in  the  unaffected areas or have personnel wear the mask only.  This decision should be made only after consulting  with  the  Public  Health  officer  (PHO)  or  the  Public  Health  Emergency Officer (PHEO) and weighing the risks of lowering the protective posture. 3.7.4.2.3.  After  weighing  the  risks  the  installation  commander  will  provide information to the base populace on the areas affected by the attack and the protective measures  required.    Continuous  monitoring  of  personnel  coming  into  the  military treatment  facility  should  continue  in  order  to  detect  any  outbreaks  of  disease.  Monitoring should continue throughout  operations to  detect  trigger events  discussed in paragraph 2.2.10.5 3.7.4.2.4.  In order to control the spread of contamination, personnel should continue to  conduct  operational  decontamination  on  equipment  they  have  to  touch  or  use.  Services should take precautions to protect food sources or issue MREs until food can be sampled to ensure it is safe to eat.  The installation may have to issue bottled water or  take  other  measures  if  the  water  source  is  unprotected  or  has  been  contaminated.  Bioenvironmental Engineers should conduct periodic assessments of the water system to detect contamination in the water supplies.  Some water supplies are provided from off  base  so  the  installation  will  have  to  coordinate  with  the  civilian  companies  or government to conduct these assessments. 3.7.5.  Radiological  Attack.    Although  radiological  attack  cannot  be  totally  dismissed  as  a conventional  CBRNE  attack,  it  is  addressed  in  the  more  probable  terrorist  attack  response AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   71  section  in  paragraph  3.8.3.3.    For  specific  information  beneficial  to  installation  first  and emergency  responders  in  their  efforts  to  prepare  against  and/or  respond  to  a  radiological threat,  refer  to  the  Radiological  Intelligence  Decision  Aid  posted  on  the  Air  Force Emergency Practice.  (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-A9). Management Community of 3.7.6.  Nuclear Attack.  A strategic or tactical warning may precede an enemy nuclear attack.  In the event deterrence fails, a tactical warning of an imminent enemy attack or an attack in progress  may provide only a  few minutes of notice or no notice (depending upon  a service member‘s  location)—for  personnel  to  take  immediate  shelter.    The  first  indication  of  a nuclear detonation is a flash of intense light and heat.  Direct radiation arrives with the light.  The leading edge of the atmospheric shock wave and fireball propagates at nearly the speed of  sound,  and  its  arrival  will  be  somewhat  delayed  behind  the  light,  heat,  and  radiation, depending  on  the  distance  from  the  detonation.    For  those  who  are  not  debilitated  by  the initial  heat  or  radiation,  this  delay  may  be  great  enough  to  allow  an  attempt  to  find  cover from the blast.  Blast hazards include trauma from flying debris, being blown into obstacles, collapsing structures or falling objects, and the overpressure wave impact itself.  There is also a  radiation  hazard  as  much  of  the  debris  and  dust  that  moves  with  the  blast  can  be radioactive.    If  enough  time  is  available  try  to  reach  a  trench,  dugout,  or  basement—these usually provide the best protection.  As soon as possible, don any protective gear at hand then move  as  quickly  and  as  far  away  from  ground  zero  as  the  mission  and  conditions  permit.  Post strike concerns will be damage assessment, restoration of combat power, and treatment of casualties.  Leaders must maintain control, take contingency actions quickly, and plan for the continued presence of radioactive contamination from fallout. 3.7.6.1.  Nuclear  Weapons  Characteristics  and  Effects.    Nuclear  weapons  have  an enormous potential for physical damage.  Even the simplest of these devices can destroy or  damage  major  portions  of  a  city.    Logistics  centers,  such  as  airfields  and  ports,  are especially vulnerable because of their value as reinforcement points.  Military forces in or deployable  to  areas  with  a  nuclear-capable  adversary  must  also  take  precautionary measures  and  develop  plans  to  mitigate  the  effects  and  recover  from  the  results  of  a nuclear detonation.  Nuclear weapons cause damage and destruction mainly from blast or shock.  Their relative effect is largely determined by the yield (strength) of the warhead and the altitude at which the warhead detonates.  Blast, thermal radiation (heat), nuclear radiation energy and electromagnetic pulse are released from a nuclear detonation.  The yield of a nuclear weapon is measured by the amount of explosive energy it can produce. 3.7.6.2.  Nuclear  Weapons  Operational  Concerns.    At  the  detonation  point,  or  ground zero,  extremely  high  dose  rates  by  gamma  rays  and  neutrons  occur  initially.    Nuclear fallout, consisting of fission products, unspent fuel, and activated material, will be present within the area close to ground zero and will be spread to areas outside the blast area by winds during and right after the detonation.  This fallout will emit alpha and beta particles and  gamma  radiation  and  cause  radiation  injury  to  people  who  do  not  clear  the  area immediately after the detonation. 3.7.6.2.1.  High  Altitude.    A  high  altitude  detonation,  or  burst,  occurs  at  an  altitude greater than 30,000 meters or about 100,000 feet above surface level.  A high energy electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is produced that can damage electrical, solid state, and unprotected electronic components.  Wide-ranging communications interruptions may   72  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 result and last  for many  hours.  The light  or  "flash" from the  weapon's fireball may produce  eye  injuries  to  personnel  witnessing  the  burst  even  though  they  are  many miles away. 3.7.6.2.2.  Air.  An air burst occurs at an altitude below 30,000 meters, but its fireball does  not  contact  the  earth's  surface.    The  fireball  and  blast  will  destroy  nearly  all unhardened  structures  and  military  equipment  at  ground  zero.    Further  out,  some  of the greatest damage will be from secondary fires.  Little or no fallout is generated by an  airburst.    While  the  fireball  is  still  glowing,  a  tremendous  amount  of  radioactive energy  is  released.    The  blast  destroys  buildings,  overturns  vehicles,  shatters  glass, and can splinter wood creating a lethal shower of debris for anyone caught in its path.  The blast wave can cause broken bones, head trauma, or internal injuries with a high potential for sudden death. 3.7.6.2.3.  Surface.    A  surface  burst  warhead  detonates  on  or  slightly  above  the surface of the earth.  The fireball will actually touch the surface of land or water.  On land, the detonation forms a large crater, carries tons of earth and debris into the air, and forms the characteristic mushroom-shaped cloud.  The cloud from a surface burst over  land  will  be  black  or  very  dark.    Over  water,  the  cloud  color  is  almost  white.  The  heaviest  amount  of  fallout  occurs  within  24  hours  in  the  immediate  area  of ground  zero  (the  point  of  detonation).    Lighter  fallout,  in  the  form  of  a  radioactive cloud,  creates  a  residual  radiation  hazard,  or  footprint,  that  can  extend  hundreds  of kilometers  downwind.    Airbases  within  the  downwind  footprint  of  a  surface  burst must take protective actions appropriate for the threat.  This includes actions to limit personnel exposure to radiation or the evacuation of personnel and equipment to safer locations. 3.7.6.2.4.  Subsurface.    A  subsurface  burst  occurs  beneath  the  surface  of  land  or water.    Cratering  will  generally  result.    If  the  fireball  does  not  penetrate  above  the surface, the primary hazard is from the heavy ground or water shock.  If the burst is shallow enough to vent to the surface, then blast, heat, ground shock, and very heavy local radioactive fallout will be present. 3.7.6.3.  Response  Actions.    For  those  bases  close  to  the  impact  area,  they  will  not  be mission  effective  and  may  not  be  capable  of  response  actions.    Installations  that  are several miles from the attack area will have to take cover and shelter personnel before the arrival  of  fallout.    The  CBRN  Control  Center  will  have  to  integrate  local  AF  weather flight or OWS subject matter expertise (SME) into CBRN Control Center operations and leverage  for  the  most  accurate  representative  CBRN  plume  model  weather  input  to determine  when  fallout  will  arrive  at  the  installation  so  missions  can  continue  until  the arrival of the fallout. 3.7.6.3.1.  If  mission  critical  equipment  is  not  protected  then  the  installation  should take  action  to  protect  these  assets  by  moving  them  inside  facilities  or  by  covering them with plastic or other available barrier materials. 3.7.6.3.2.  Shelters should be prepared IAW the local shelter plan or CEMP 10-2. 3.7.6.3.3.  The installation commander should consult with BE and EM personnel on the following: health effects of radiation, determining operational risks for continuing AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   73  operations,  determining  when  operations  should  be  suspended,  and  determining exposure limits for personnel operating in a nuclear contaminated environment. 3.7.6.3.4.  After fall-out arrives, assessment teams should be sent out to determine the hazardous areas and if there are areas with less radioactive contamination.  Turn back times or exposure limits must be set for the teams before they are released to conduct the  surveys.    BE  or  shelter  management  personnel  will  issue  electronic  personal dosimeters (EPD) to the assessment teams prior to leaving the shelter.  Exposure logs will have to be maintained on personnel entering and leaving the shelter by the shelter manager or designee. 3.7.6.3.5.  Once the assessment teams complete an assessment of the installation, the commander  must  consider  the  information  and  then  disseminate  information  on  the hazard areas, level of contamination, damage, protective postures, shelter stay times, and any mission critical actions that must take place.  The commander will establish mission  objectives  through  the  EOC  Director  and  response  and  recovery  teams  will accomplish those mission essential tasks. 3.7.6.3.6.  The  installation  commander  will  determine  when  recovery  actions  will occur  after  considering  the  levels  of  contamination,  risk  to  personnel,  missions,  and hazards. 3.7.7.  Conventional  Attack  Threat.    Conventional  attack  threats  include  missiles,  artillery, mortar,  mines,  direct  small  arms  and  high-yield  explosives.    The  conventional  threat  is generally associated with military forces, but is also in the hands of insurgents and terrorists.  Nation-state  adversaries‘  preparations  and  specific  assets  can  be  detected  by  intelligence organizations  well  before  attack.    Insurgent  and  terrorist  preparations  and  assets  are  not usually detected by our intelligence organizations prior to an attack. 3.7.7.1.  Conventional Attack Characteristics.  Theater ballistic missile attacks with high-explosive warheads are the primary conventional threat to airbases.  Large-scale airbase attacks by aircraft armed with conventional weapons are unlikely, unless air dominance is lost.    If  hostile  aircraft  reach  the  airbase,  they  would  most  likely  attack  large,  high visibility  targets  such  as  airfield  surfaces,  troop  concentrations,  tent  cities,  tactical  and cargo  aircraft  in  open  areas,  petroleum,  oils,  and  lubricants,  storage  tanks,  and  visible command  and  control  structures.    Attacking  aircraft  may  employ  conventional  or precision-guided  munitions,  cluster  munitions,  guided  missiles,  rockets,  and  aircraft cannon. 3.7.7.2.  Six  classes  of  conventional  weapons  are  considered  threats  to  airbases:  bombs, rockets and missiles, projectiles and mortars, landmines, bomblets, and rocket propelled grenades and grenades.  You must know the type of weapons you are defending against to  determine  the  correct  design  and  placement  of  protective  shelters,  revetments,  and individual cover. 3.7.7.2.1.  Bombs  are  generally  classified  into  four  major  categories  of  high-explosive,  chemical,  pyrotechnic,  and  practice.    They  are  further  classified  into specific  categories  according  to  their  tactical  employment  such  as  dumb  or  smart bombs.  Dumb bombs are designed to impact a target based upon their release from the aircraft only, where as a smart bomb focuses on its target through a dynamic set   74  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 of  electronic  fuzes.    Typical  bombs  that  may  be  encountered  during  peacetime  and wartime are classified as general-purpose, armor-piercing, fragmentation, destructors, and special purpose bombs. 3.7.7.2.2.  Rockets  and  missiles  are  generally  classified  as  spin-stabilized  (rotating rockets),  fin-stabilized  (non-rotating  rockets),  or  guided  and  designed  to  be  used against stationary or moving targets in the air or on the ground.  The type of rocket or missile determines the fuze classification which in-turn determines the type of target it is used against. 3.7.7.2.3.  Projectiles and mortars are generally classified as spin or fin stabilized and are used in tanks, anti-tank guns, and some aircraft.  The projectile or mortar is that part  of  a  complete  round  of  ammunition  that  is  projected  from  these  weapons  as  a result of gas pressure developed by a burning propelling charge when the weapon is fired.  The projectile or mortar is classified according to their degree of assembly of all  components  and  can  be  fixed,  semi-fixed,  separated,  or  separate  loading.    The most  basic  means  of  identifying  a  projectile  is  by  its  caliber  and  method  of stabilization in flight. 3.7.7.2.4.  Landmines  are  generally  categorized  as  antipersonnel  or  antitank,  hidden under  the  surface  of  the  ground,  and  detonated  by  applied  pressure  or  pressure-release, depending  upon  the fuzing.   Antipersonnel  mines usually consist  of a small amount of high explosives, less than 1 pound, whereas antitank mines may contain as much  as  22  pounds.    They  are  extremely  dangerous  because  their  placement  is generally  under  earth  cover  when  in  the  open  or  under  some  object  when  placed inside a building or occupied structure and not easily visible to the human eye.  Many contain more than one method of fuzing used to detonate the main charge, known as a secondary fuze or booby-trap. 3.7.7.2.5.  Bomblets are small bombs that are one of a number usually contained in a cluster  bomb.    These  bomblets  can  be  air-dropped  or  ground-delivered.    The  most common  types  are  designed  to  kill  enemy  personnel  and  destroy  tanks,  but  are sometimes used as area denial in the form of anti-tank, anti-runway, and mine laying. 3.7.7.2.6.  Rocket  propelled  grenades  and  grenades  are  generally  categorized  as fragmentation,  practice,  offensive,  riot  control,  smoke  grenades,  or  incendiary grenades.  They are designed to be launched by a gun or hand thrown.  Fragmentation grenades have high-explosive fillers, a striker-initiated delay-element fuze, and a case that fragments on detonation of the filler.  Offensive grenades are used principally for blast  effect.    Smoke  grenades  are  made  of  sheet  metal  and  designed  to  obscure  the vision of the enemy. 3.7.7.2.7.  Each  of  the  aforementioned  weapon  systems  can  be  used  as  part  of  an improvised  explosive  device  (IED),  which  is  an  unconventional  weapon  used  to incapacitate or kill personnel or destroy structures, either man-made or natural.  IEDs are  the  most  dangerous  of  all  weapons  employed  during  wartime  based  upon  their unpredictability  to  function  as  designed  and  the  ability  to  determine  the  amount  of damage that can be caused by one device.  Additionally, explosive material extracted from  these  weapons  can  be  placed  into  different  types  of  common  containers  or vehicles and inconspicuously placed in public places. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   75  3.7.7.2.8.  Explosive Effects.  When an explosive is detonated, the primary effects are the result of blast overpressure and fragmentation.  Fires may also result from the heat produced by the blast, incendiary components from the weapon, or from the ignition of flammable material near the detonation.  The Base Civil Engineer determines the most  effective  protective  shelter  and  barrier  requirements,  and  identifies  safe evacuation  distances  based  upon  the  expected  effects  of  a  detonation.    Detailed information  on  blast  effects,  calculation  of  blast  standoff  distances,  and  planning factors are in  Air Force Handbook (AFH) 10-222 Volume 14, Civil Engineer Guide to Fighting Positions, Shelters, Obstacles, and Revetments and AFH 10-2401, Vehicle Bomb  Mitigation  Guide  (VBMG)  (FOUO),  and  Figure  A5.10,  Recommended Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Minimum Evacuation Distance (MED).  Unified Facilities  Criteria  (UFC)  4-010-01,  DoD  Minimum  Antiterrorism  Standards  for Buildings,  UFC  4-010-02,  DoD  Minimum  Antiterrorism  Standoff  Distances  for Buildings  (FOUO),  and  DoD  6055.9-STD,  DoD  Ammunition  and  Explosive  Safety Standards. 3.7.7.3.  The  specific  notification  actions  to  take  for  Alarm  Red  depend  upon  the  threat and  the  location  of  the  individual  or  weapon  system.    Whenever  possible,  the  CAT  or EOC  should  supplement  attack  warning  signals  with  detailed  attack  information.    If available, provide the attack type, expected attack location and time remaining until the attack  begins.    Supplemental  information  enables  individuals  and  units  to  execute  the most effective protective actions and minimize mission degradation.  It  also enables the airbase to  tailor notification  actions and  respond  to  simultaneous, multiple threats.  The CAT  should  not  delay  attack  warning  solely  to  include  supplemental  information.  Likewise,  individuals  and  units  should  not  delay  protective  actions  to  wait  for supplemental  information.    React  to  Alarm  Red  warning  immediately  and  based  on  the information available.  If supplemental information is incomplete or unavailable, execute the most stringent alarm red protective actions, then contact the UCC or work center and request guidance.  Alarm Red notification tasks are dependent upon the CAT, EOC, and UCC  personnel  completing  their  warning  and  notification  actions  before  assuming protective  actions  unless  under  direct  attack  or  otherwise  directed.    This  enables  rapid warning  of  the  airbase  population  and  takes  advantage  of  the  hardening  protection provided to most command and control facilities. 3.7.7.3.1.  Response actions for missile attacks are not always as simple as declaring Alarm  Red.    The  operations  and  support  staff  use  the  planned  warning  timelines  to implement  actions.    For  example,  a  missile  launch  warning  received  during  aircraft generation  and  recovery,  cargo  aircraft  load/unload,  bomb-buildup,  PAR,  or  combat turn  operations  would  each  require  specific  actions.    The  commander  may  direct some  operations  to  continue  or  safely  terminate  depending  on  the  estimated  time  to impact. 3.7.7.3.2.  Report observed attacks or enemy personnel movement to the unit control center  or  work  center  as  soon  as  they  occur.    Armed  individuals  should  defend themselves  under  the  current  Rules  of  Engagement  (ROE)  and  coordinate  actions with  other  personnel  within  their  areas.    Assist  injured  personnel  if  possible  and shelter personnel and equipment.   76  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 3.7.7.3.3.  Mission  Continuation.    The  airbase  commander  may  direct  mission essential  activities  to  continue  or  prioritize  mission  essential  activities  required  to continue during all Alarm Reds, regardless of the cause of the alarm.  The importance of these missions should justify the increased risk to personnel and resources. 3.7.7.3.4.  After  the  attack  is  over,  assessment  teams  will  have  to  conduct  surveys around the installation with priority given to runways, taxiways, and critical facilities.  Once  the  assessment  is  completed,  the  installation  commander  will  determine recovery  objectives  and  communicate  them  to  the  EOC  Director  who  will  carry  out recovery actions in order to continue the mission. 3.7.8.  Response  to  TIC/TIM  Attacks  in  Wartime  Environments.    While  similar  in  many aspects, response to attacks involving TIC/TIM during wartime is not the same as response to attacks involving chemical warfare agents (CWA).  On the positive side, TIC/TIM materials other  than  those  categorized  as  CWA,  are  generally  not  as  deadly  as  conventional  CWA and/or have other limitations that prevent the material from being used as an effective CWA.  On  the  negative  side,  existing  IPE  is  not  designed  to  provide  complete  protection  from  all TIC/TIM.  While the limitation of IPE is a significant influence in a commander‘s decision making  process,  the  IPE  is  effective  against  the  vast  majority  of  high-threat  TIC/TIM.  Increased  risk  to  human  safety  is  a  necessary  part  of  wartime  activities  and  termination  of critical mission activities may not be an acceptable alternative.  Consequently, for these and other  threat-related  reasons,  response  to  TIC/TIM  attacks  in  wartime  environments  cannot mirror procedures utilized for home station response in peacetime situations. 3.7.8.1.  The  threat  profile  for  TIC/TIM  in  wartime  environments  has  at  least  five considerations: hazard plume size, nature of the residual hazard, toxicity of the material, ability  of  IPE  to  provide  protection,  and  ability  to  detect  the  substance(s).    While  there are exceptions because of the large number of potential TIC/TIM that could be involved in  an  attack,  the  following  paragraphs  provide  representative  information  regarding  the likely TIC/TIM threat. 3.7.8.1.1.  TIC/TIM  are  not  likely  to  be  disseminated  in  traditional  weapon  systems (missiles,  bombs,  mortars,  etc.)  used  to  attack  Air  Force  installations,  primarily because  they  do  not  possess  sufficient  toxicity  to  be  effectively  disseminated  in traditional weapon systems.  Rather, the most likely attack methodologies will be to sabotage  nearby  industrial  facilities  possessing  large  TIC/TIM  storage  containers, utilize railcars and trucks that normally carry TIC/TIM as the delivery system, and/or develop  improvised  delivery  systems  using  smaller  TIC/TIM  containers  (150  pound cylinders and/or one-ton containers for instance).  Figure 3.2, displays some potential TIC/TIM  delivery  mechanisms.    The  probable  hazard  plumes  generated  by  these attack methodologies will likely differ significantly from the hazard profiles outlined in the Department of Transportation (DOT) Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG).  The ERG does not provide hazard plume estimations that are operationally useful.  In some  cases,  the  hazard  distance  is  likely  to  be  larger  than  that  depicted  in  the  ERG while in most situations the hazard distance is likely to be much less than the value(s) shown  in  the  ERG.    The  primary  reason  for  these  differences  is  that  the  ERG  has large  safety  factors  built  into  it  in  order  to  accommodate  the  large  amount  of uncertainties that will exist at the time of the event.  This is further exacerbated by the ERG‘s use of a ―one-size-fits-all‖ approach for large spills (defined as anything more AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   77  than  200  liters/53  gallons),  and  the  ERG  guidance  that  states,  initial  isolation  and protective  action  distances  in  this  guidebook  are  derived  from  historical  data  on transportation  incidents  and  the  use  of  statistical  models.    For  worst  case  scenarios involving  the  instantaneous  release  of  the  entire  contents  of  a  package  (e.g.,  as  a result  of  terrorism,  sabotage  or  catastrophic  accident)  the  distances  may  increase substantially.  For such events, doubling of the initial isolation and protective action distances  is  appropriate  in  absence  of  other  information.    Table  3.6,  provides examples  of  probable  TIC/TIM  hazard  plume  dimensions  and  how  these  compare with DOT ERG estimates.  Note:  The ERG distances shown in Table 3.6, have not been  multiplied  by  the  factor  of  two.    The  ERG  is  a  transportation  encompassing handbook  for  the  First  Responder,  providing  initial  cordon  distances  for  the  first  30 minutes upon arrival. Figure 3.2.

Note 2:  Hazard distances for automated plumes were based on the level where unprotected, exposed people would begin to experience sub-lethal effects. 3.7.8.1.2.  The nature of the residual hazard following a TIC/TIM attack differs from that  of  an  attack  involving  CWA.    Primary  threat  CWA  attacks  on  an  air-base  will generally  involve  an  agent  released  in  liquid  form.    Immediately  upon  release  the liquid  generally  begins  to  absorb  into  the  surface  it  comes  in  contact  with,  and  also begins  to  generate  toxic  vapors  as  the  liquid  begins  to  evaporate.    As  long  as  the liquid is on the surface it remains a contact hazard, with the vapor of nerve and blister agents  presenting both  an inhalation and percutaneous (skin penetration)  hazard.   In many cases TIC/TIM present a different hazard profile.  In some cases, such as with sulfuric  acid,  the  substance  is  a  contact  hazard  while  it  remains  on  the  surface  but does  not  generate  a  downwind  vapor  hazard.    In  many  other  cases  (such  as  with chlorine,  ammonia,  hydrogen  cyanide,  phosgene,  and  methyl  isocyanate)  the TIC/TIM rapidly turns from a liquid to a vapor or small liquid particles upon release and  presents  primarily  only  an  inhalation  hazard  for  people  that  were  not  in  the immediate vicinity of the release.  Consequently, as opposed to being the longer-term, continuous hazard posed by  CWA that remains  as long  as the liquid  is  evaporating, the TIC/TIM hazard is generally transient (e.g., it exists only in potentially militarily significant  amounts  for  the  length  of  time  it  takes  for  the  vapor  or  small  liquid particles to pass over the area as it is carried by the wind).  After the initial release, liquid  and  vapor  will  continue  to  be  released  at  a  slower  rate  that  is  limited  by  the ability  of  the  residual  liquid  in  the  tank  to  absorb  heat  from  the  environment.    The residual  liquid  will  cool  itself  to  below  zero  (F)  temperatures  and  experience  has shown  that  many  small  container  punctures  are  sealed  by  the  formation  water  frost and ice from the atmosphere.  This means that the TIC containers can contain residual material  that  will  continue  to  emit  toxic  vapors  long  after  the  initial  release.    This residual  hazard  can  be  handled  utilizing  standard  HAZMAT  procedures.    It  is  the initial explosive release that creates the downwind hazard distances depicted in Table 3.6 3.7.8.1.3.  While  inherently  hazardous  to  human  health,  even  the  TIC/TIM  listed  as ―high  threat‖  on  lists  generated  by  International  Task  Force  (ITF)  25  and  ITF  40 groups are generally much less toxic than the primary CWA of concern to Air Force installations.    The  fact  that  militarily  significant  concentrations  of  TIC/TIM  will generally only be in an area for a relatively short period, and that Air Force personnel will  have  some  level  of  protection  (being  inside  facilities,  wearing  protective  mask, etc.)  also  help  mitigate  the  toxicological  effect  of  many  TIC/TIM.    Table  3.7, provides  a  comparison  of  the  relative  toxicity  between  major  CWAs  and  some potential TIC/TIM hazards.   80  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Table 3.7.

While military IPE was designed to protect against chemical, radiological, and biological agents as opposed to the full spectrum of TIC/TIM, the IPE does have good protective capabilities for many of the most probable high threat TIC/TIM that would likely be used in an attack against an Air Force installation.  See Appendix E of  AFTTP  3-2.46,  for  details  regarding  the  assessment  of  protective  filter  element performance against 21 high, 41 medium, and 36 low-hazard TIC vapors and gasses.  Note:  Filter elements were assessed as ―effective‖ for 18 of the 21 high-threat TICs. 3.7.8.1.5.  Limitations exist in detection of TIC/TIM in the field, just as they exist in the areas of chemical and biological agent detection.  This is especially true when it comes  to  the  availability  and  quantity  of  instruments  capable  of  detecting  and measuring  the  concentration  of  TIC/TIM  vapors.    However,  in  several  instances people can detect the presence of the high-threat TIC/TIM through the sense of smell AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   81  before  impairment  levels  are  reached.    Even  without  other  warning,  such  as  being alerted by the installation notification and warning system, this may allow personnel to  take  protective  actions  such  as  donning  their  protective  mask  prior  to  receiving incapacitating dosages.  Table 3.8, portrays the odor thresholds in comparison to the toxicity thresholds for several high-threat TIC/TIM. Table 3.8.

Installations  should  use  the  following  basic  steps  and  considerations  when responding to TIC/TIM attacks in wartime environments. 3.7.8.2.1.  Determine the likelihood that mobile TIC/TIM storage containers (rail car, tanker truck, etc.) or fixed TIC/TIM storage facilities are close enough, or could get close enough to the installation to the point that they could cause adverse effects if the storage container(s) were sabotaged or otherwise used as delivery mechanisms.  See Table  3.6,  Illustrative  TIC/TIM  Hazard  Plume  Dimensions,  for  assistance  in  this area.    In  the  case  of  fixed  storage  facilities,  identify  the  specific  TIC/TIM  involved and  determine  the  effectiveness  of  the  IPE  mask  filter  elements  against  the material(s). 3.7.8.2.2.  Following the initial attack response procedures for chemical attacks in the event  of  an  observed  attack  (declare  Alarm  Red,  MOPP  4;  have  personnel  remain   82  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 inside facilities to the extent possible, etc.).  Declare Alarm Black, MOPP 4 and direct people to remain inside facilities to the extent possible in the event of an attack that is discovered using smell or the onset of symptoms. 3.7.8.2.3.  Use  the  estimated  distance  from  the  attack  location  to  the  edge  of  the installation  furthest  from  the  release  point  divided  by  one-half  the  wind  speed  to determine the likely time when the hazard cloud will pass over the installation.  For example, if the distance was 3 kilometers and the wind speed was 12 kilometers per hour,  the  trailing  edge  of  the  TIC/TIM  hazard  plume  would  likely  pass  over  the installation in 30 minutes from the time of attack. 3.7.8.2.4.  Use  available  detectors  to  identify  the  specific  TIC/TIM  involved  and  to verify that the hazard plume was no longer present on the installation.  Return to the appropriate, lesser alarm and MOPP posture (Alarm Green, MOPP 2 for instance) at the appropriate time. 3.7.8.2.5.  Use  very  sensitive  detectors  such  as  the  HAPSITE  to  conduct  post  attack health risk assessments.   Provide information  to  the population  regarding symptoms to be aware of, screen and triage exposed personnel, and provide medical treatment to the extent necessary. 3.7.8.2.6.  Until  Air  Force-wide  decontamination  procedures  are  established, decontamination  of  TIC/TIMs  will  be  accomplished,  when  required  using  locally developed resources and procedures, to the maximum extent possible. 3.7.9.  Toxic  Industrial  Materials.    TIM  hazards,  previously  considered  insignificant  during wartime,  increase  greatly  in  significance  when  manufactured,  stored,  distributed,  or transported  in  close  proximity  to  fixed  sites,  ports,  or  airfields.    Deliberate  or  inadvertent release  significantly  increases  hazards  to  the  indigenous  population  and  US  forces.    While CW agents are highly toxic and lethal in small amounts, the countries that produce them are generally  known  and  are  few  in  number  when  compared  with  the  quantities  and  universal nature  of  TIM.    Given  the  prevalence  of  TIM  throughout  the  world,  US  forces  use  area studies, intelligence estimates, and/or economic studies possibly to indicate TIM hazards in an AO.  TIM should be recognized for the singular hazards they pose as well as the potential risks that may result from an explosion or a fire.  Most TIM will present a vapor (inhalation) hazard.  Vapor concentration at or near the point of release may be very high and may reduce the oxygen concentration below that required to support life.  TIMs are generally classified in one of the following categories: 3.7.9.1.  Agricultural—includes insecticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. 3.7.9.2.  Industrial—chemical  and processes, in fuel, or in cleaning. radiological  materials  used in  manufacturing 3.7.9.3.  Production and research—chemicals and biological materials produced or stored in a facility. 3.7.9.4.  Radiological—nuclear power plants, medical facilities, and laboratories. 3.7.9.5.  Response Actions.  Fixed sites with large bulk storage of materials are potential hazards.  Units that have positioned themselves in the downwind or local area to the TIM sites must be prepared to take appropriate response actions on short notice following TIM AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   83  releases.    Following  a  TIM  release  response  agencies  will  respond  using  the  First  and Emergency Responders‘ mission process in paragraph  3.6  If personnel are in wartime posture,  then  the  EOC  Director  will  determine  what  teams  will  respond  to  mitigate  the hazards.  The EOC Director will determine what protective measures are required for the hazard  posed  by  the  release  of  TIM,  if  known  and  appoint  an  incident  commander  for tactical level command during the incident. 3.8.  Terrorist  Attack  Response  Actions.  Terrorist  use  of  CBRNE  materials  is  an  irregular warfare event that poses a significant threat to installations and personnel due to the potential for damage,  casualties  and  mission  disruption.    Commanders  ensure  that  their  installations  can respond to a terrorist attack by using the CBRNE incident response procedures in the installation CEMP  10-2  or  other  relevant  plan  (DCP  in  the  aftermath  of  a  covert  biological  attack  for instance).  In-place or deployed emergency response forces (Med, FES, CE and SF) provide the bulk of terrorist attack response and recovery mission capabilities as defined in Attachment  3.  This capability can be augmented by host nation forces, mutual aid and support agreements and through  the  deliberate  addition  of  specialized  response  forces.    If  an  attack  occurs,  additional response forces from the FBI, FEMA, or the DOD may also be available.  AFI 10-2501, AFI 10-245, AFMAN 10-2504 and this Manual, outline actions for an irregular operational environment CBRNE attack response. 3.8.1.  Initial installation response  actions for  a terrorist attack are largely  dependent  on the degree  of  warning.    Additionally,  response  actions  taken  during  a  terrorist  attack  with CBRNE  materials  are  identical  in  nature  to  the  hazardous  materials  response  as  defined  in AFMAN  10-2504.    The  goals  during  a  response  to  a  terrorist  CBRNE  attack  are:  protect lives,  property,  and  the  mission.    The  response  phase  ends  when  emergency  actions  have been  implemented  and  lifesaving  actions  have  been  completed;  however,  some  response actions  may  be  done  during  prevention,  preparedness  or  recovery  phases  of  incident management. 3.8.2.  Initial  terrorist  attack  response  considerations  include:  responding  and  establishing incident command, lifesaving and rescuing personnel, suppressing and containing the hazard, establishing cordons, controlling site access, establishing tactical priorities, determining and communicating  protective  measures,  preserving  all  potential  evidence,  and  establishing responder  protection.    Initial  terrorist  response  actions  also  include  critical  mission continuation,  relocation,  transfer,  or  termination  decisions,  with  the  accompanying  mission restoration or sustainment activities. 3.8.3.  Installation  planners  should  identify  the  threats  to  their  installation  during  the vulnerability assessment process.  Each agent or material a terrorist can attack an installation with will present varying hazards and response actions. 3.8.3.1.  Chemical.    Terrorist  employment  of  chemical  agents  influences  operational tempo  and  sustainment  of  forces.    However,  the  mission must  continue  in  a  chemically contaminated environment.  A clear understanding of what is required as a response to a chemical  attack,  coupled  with  risk-based  management  lessens  mission  disruption  and delays.  Contamination avoidance is the primary action taken to minimize the impact of chemical  contamination  on  operations.    Successful  avoidance  measures  significantly reduce  and  prevent  contamination  of  personnel,  equipment,  vehicle,  aircraft  and  cargo.    84  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Decontamination  efforts  must  focus  individual  actions  necessary  to  maintain  and/or restore combat operations. 3.8.3.2.  Biological.    A  terrorist  biological  attack  may  be  covertly  done,  masked  as  a conventional attack, or as a deliberate act of war.  A commander may not know an attack has occurred until personnel present with symptoms.  The basis for the AF response to a biological  attack  is  first  to  detect  a  biological  attack  and  then  identify  the  agent  used.  Detection  and  warning  of  the  attack  are  critical  to  the  implementation  of  protective measures.  Detection of trigger events is indicative of a biological attack.  Trigger events determine  how  far  into  the  execution  phase  the  response  to  a  biological  event  begins.  This  response  timing  shapes  the  installation‘s  response  capability.    The  closer  the response is  to  the actual event,  the less likely the damage to  operations.   The  goal  is  to reduce  the  gap  between  the  actual  occurrence  of  the  event  and  its  discovery,  thus maximizing the number of options for responding to the threat. 3.8.3.3.  Radiological.    A  terrorist  could  use  a  myriad  of  delivery  means  to  employ radiological  materials.    Radiological  hazards  produce  difficult  choices  for  operations  in urban environments.  Radiation may be masked by barriers until personnel are too close to be considered safe.  Fast moving operations through an area containing a radiological hazard often progress more quickly than some instruments can respond to the presence of radiation.    Building  surfaces  may  allow  radiological  hazards  to  radiate  in  place  until moved  by  wind,  water  or  other  movements.    Buildings  may  also  shield  or  scatter radiation.    Quality  sample  collection  is  especially  critical  for  analysis  and  identification of  radiological  materials.    Although  BE  and  EM  personnel  possess  radioisotope identifiers, definitive identification requires a certified reference laboratory to provide the highest  accuracy.    A  radiation  dispersal  device  (RDD)  is  any  device  that  causes  the purposeful dissemination of radioactive material without a nuclear detonation.  An RDD could function as a terror weapon or terrain-denial mechanism.  Most RDDs function by using conventional explosives to blow up and scatter the radioactive source debris across the targeted area.  This type of weapon may also cause conventional casualties to become contaminated  with  radioactive  material  and  complicate  the  rescue,  medical  evacuation and recovery actions within the contaminated area.  Responders must use and be familiar with the nuclear and radiological decision tools in Attachment  5.  Detailed information regarding the radiological threat and probable residual hazard is included in Attachment 6. 3.8.3.4.  Nuclear.  Nuclear weapons are the most destructive man-made force on the face of the earth.  Even the simplest nuclear device can destroy or damage major portions of a city or  greatly impair the communications and  electronics infrastructure  of a large area.  Following  a  nuclear  ground  burst,  fallout  that  contains  lethal  amounts  of  radioactive debris  may  be  all  around.    All  nuclear  detonations  create  blast,  heat,  nuclear  radiation, and  electromagnetic  pulse.    Logistics  centers,  such  as  fixed  airfields  and  ports,  are vulnerable  because  of  their  value  as  reinforcement  points.    Military  forces  in  or deployable  to  areas  with  a  nuclear-capable  adversary  where  a  terrorist  might  obtain nuclear  materials  must  also  take  precautionary  measures  and  develop  plans  to  mitigate the  effects  and  recover  from  the  results  of  a  nuclear  detonation.    Improvised  Nuclear Devices  (IND)  incorporate  numerous  radioactive  materials  designed  to  result  in  the formation of a functioning nuclear weapon.  Response to IND attacks within the area of AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   85  prompt  (immediate)  effects  (e.g.,  blast,  thermal  radiation  and  electromagnetic  pulse) should be consistent with response to a nuclear weapon attack.  The remaining response (e.g., downwind response actions) should be consistent with radiological response actions to a RDD.  For example, prompt radiation is anticipated out to 20 km (12 miles) for a 10 kiloton  (kt)  IND.    Actual  values  should  be  validated  by  detectors  at  the  time  of  event.  Table A6.1, in Attachment 6 outlines the expected hazard areas for 1kt and 10 kt INDs. 3.8.3.5.  High  Yield  Explosive.    Terrorist  use  of  high-yield  explosives  influences  the operational tempo and restoration of critical installation infrastructural capabilities.  The actions  following  a  terrorist  use  of  high-yield  explosives  are  focused  on  two  tenets: restoring situational awareness and restoration of mission activities.  The specific actions to take depend upon the location of the individual or weapon system.  Whenever possible, the  CAT  or  EOC  should  supplement  attack  warning  signals  with  detailed  attack information.    If  available,  provide  the  attack  type  and  attack  location.    Supplemental information enables individuals and units to execute the most effective protective actions and  minimize  mission  degradation.    Information  also  enables  the  installation  to  tailor actions and respond to simultaneous, multiple threats.  The CAT should not delay attack warning  solely  to  include  supplemental  information.    Likewise,  individuals  and  units should  not  delay  protective  actions  to  wait  for  supplemental  information.    React  to warning immediately based on the information available.  If supplemental information is incomplete or unavailable, execute the most stringent protective actions, then contact the UCC or work center and request guidance.  Report observed attacks or enemy personnel movement to the UCC or work center as soon as they occur.  Assist injured personnel if possible.  Otherwise, remain in the current position and under cover until provided with further instructions.  When it is safe to send response teams out to make an assessment, response teams will use the First and Emergency Responders‘ mission process. 3.9.  Withdrawal/Evacuation.  Withdrawal  occurs  when  response  forces  are  in  imminent danger or all response actions have been completed.  Withdrawal may be immediate or planned.  Evacuate people in immediate danger of a downwind hazard.  Move victims away from the scene and away from responders when evacuating personnel. 3.9.1.  Evacuation is a viable option for  ensuring  the preservation of the base populace and resources.  In cases where the mission is not time-critical, and a SIP option may increase the risk of exposure or harm, the commander may elect to evacuate the area.  Relocation enables the commander to maintain operational capability by conducting operations from alternative locations. 3.9.1.1.  Rarely  is  the  specific  agent  identified  immediately  after  an  incident.    Although protection from specific agents is to shelter-in-place, or evacuate, the guidance for each specific agent differs.  In order to adequately protect personnel from all potential agents prior to identification, standardized SIP guidance directs personnel to protect themselves from  the  most  likely  agents  by  combining  the  similar  actions  for  each  agent  into  one procedure. 3.9.1.2.  For conventional or irregular warfare, an evacuation will most likely be an IC‘s decision  based  upon  the  information  received  at  the  incident  site  during  initial  incident assessment.  This decision will occur when it is too dangerous to have personnel shelter-  86  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 in-place.    An  IC  must  have  a  means  to  move  personnel  safely,  and  a  location  to  move personnel to before evacuating. 3.9.1.3.  The installation commander will make decisions to evacuate personnel from the installation.   A  major  factor  in  an  evacuation  decision  is  shelter  availability, transportation to move personnel, mission criticality of assets to be moved, and the safety of personnel evacuated.  AFI 10-2501 outlines the steps necessary to conduct evacuation planning  within  the  installation  CEMP  10-2.    AFI  10-208  provides  additional  guidance on moving mission critical personnel. 3.9.2.  Identify  an  alternate  facility  if  your  primary  is  forced  to  evacuate.    Coordinate  this alternate facility with the EOC.  Initial information on the type of incident and on-the-ground conditions  must  be  received,  analyzed,  and  disseminated.    This  information  is  crucial  to support  many  key  functions.    Among  these  key  functions  is  deciding  what  areas  should receive instructions on whether to evacuate or to SIP. 3.9.3.  When the decision to evacuate an area has been made, a safe evacuation route must be identified, and the plan must be clearly communicated.  Use of a safe rally point is especially important in cases where there could be confusion and hysteria.  These critical factors should be planned and routinely exercised, thus providing a level of confidence in the unit‘s ability to execute evacuation plans.  Personnel or equipment evacuated from a hazard area should be checked for the possibility of residual contamination. 3.9.4.  SIP.  Sheltering in place is used when it is more advantageous to remain indoors rather than  evacuate  and  become  exposed  to  CBRNE  effects.    For  shelter-in-place  operations, installations  must  identify  procedures  for  each  facility  to  turn  off  their  heating,  ventilation and  air-conditioning  systems.    Shelter-in-place  actions  can  provide  short-term,  one-to-two hours, protection to the occupants and are most effective when building occupants plan and practice  their  actions  in  advance.    Detailed  information  on  shelter-in-place  procedures  is located in Attachment 4. 3.9.5.  Decision Trees.  Decision trees are useful decision support aids to implement specific conventional or irregular action goals.  Refer to the Protective Actions to Minimize Exposure and Protective Actions to Avoid Fatalities tables defined in AFMAN 10-2504. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   87  Chapter 4 RECOVERY AND MITIGATION 4.1.  Overview  of  Recovery  and  Mitigation.  The  goal  of  recovery  is  to  re-establish  the installation  mission  and  return  to  normal  operations.    Though  there  are  supporting  goals,  re-establishment of the mission is paramount.  This implies that there may be critical missions that must continue before or during the recovery phase.  Installations must plan for those operations and develop procedures to remove or minimize the hazards in an area or at a facility in order to continue  the  critical  mission.    Analyzing  the  information  from  the  post-attack  reconnaissance teams--to define the hazard perimeter and characterize the hazard--is the start of recovery actions after  an  enemy  attack.    This  chapter  will  discuss  contamination  control  operations  such  as personnel  decontamination,  resource  decontamination  and  contaminated  waste  operations.  Contamination avoidance is a supporting key principle for recovery actions.  Consequently, this chapter  will  discuss  the  actions  required  during  a  terrorist  attack,  (e.g.,  conducting  damage assessment, contamination control and developing an incident action plan).  Medical protection and  casualty  management  are  key  actions  required  during  the  recovery  phase.    In  addition,  the chapter will discuss mitigation.  The goal of mitigating actions is to reduce or eliminate risks or effects to personnel or property prior to, during, and after an incident.  Mitigation actions may be taken  during  all  phases  of  incident  management.    These  actions  include:  documenting information;  tracking  of  events;  after-action  reporting;  analyzing  damage;  implementing  the  incident  action  plan;  documenting  contamination;  accounting  for  classified  and  hazardous materials;  maintaining  installation  or  site  security;  assisting  personnel;  providing  the  response personnel  stress  debriefing;  providing  legal  assistance  for  claims,  witnesses,  and  victims;  base populace actions; and issuing notifications and communications. 4.1.1.  Recovery  Considerations  for  Attacks  during  Conventional  and  Irregular  Warfare Operations.   Recovery  requires  detailed  planning.    Mission  priorities  may  require commanders  to  make  determinations  on  protective  postures  and  recovery  actions  based  on incomplete  information.    Recovery  decisions  should  focus  installation  resources  on lifesaving,  preventing  the  further  loss  of  combat  power,  maintaining  or  restoring  base integrity  and security, restoring C2 over forces,  primary mission restoration, and support  to other  forces.    Actions  require  stabilizing  the  incident  and,  if  needed,  allowing  critical missions  to  continue.    Decisions  will  be  based  on  an  operational  risk  assessment  weighing known  hazards  and  the  risk  to  personnel  operating  in  the  area.    The  EOC  must  coordinate recovery actions with the BDOC to ensure the safety of recovery operations.  Some materials cannot  be  decontaminated  and  will  need  to  be  segregated  or  destroyed.    If  heavy contamination  is  present,  it  may  be  desirable  initially  to  allow  weathering  and  to  relocate non-essential personnel and uncontaminated equipment to uncontaminated areas of the base.  Long  term  recovery  efforts  will  require  outside  assistance  with  clean-up  actions.    Attacks with  biological  agents  will  present  issues  with  detection  and  locating  the  area  of contamination.    There  may  be  no  indication  until  affected  people  begin  to  arrive  at  the medical treatment facility.  It may take days to determine the location and scope of the attack.  After  hostilities  are  over,  reconstitution  efforts  could  be  easy  for  some  biological  agents because  they  degrade  rapidly  when  exposed  to  the  outside  environment.    For  example, botulinum toxin is inactivated by sunlight within 1 -3 hours, yersina pestis (plague) becomes desiccated  in  areas  with  low  humidity  and  is  susceptible  to  heat  and  exposure  to  sunlight.    88  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Other  biological  agents,  such  as  anthrax,  could  remain  in  the  soil  or  materials  for  several years  unless  deliberately  decontaminated.    In  addition,  radioactive  contamination  creates complex issues during remediation actions.  There could be areas that the base populace will not be able to enter for many years. 4.2.  Contamination Control.  Contamination control includes not only fixating contamination, but  also  avoiding  the  contamination.    Avoidance,  within  the  context  of  this  Manual,  means taking actions to avoid or minimize the impact of a CBRN attack and to reduce the effects of the CBRN  hazard.    In  addition,  decontaminating  personnel  and  resources  limits  the  spread  of contamination. 4.2.1.  Decontamination  Operations.    The  traditional  operational  environment  includes  four levels  of  decontamination  operations:  immediate,  operational,  thorough,  and  clearance.  Given  our  current  lack  of  suitable  decontamination  methods,  under  most  traditional operational environmental conditions commanders should not attempt thorough or clearance decontamination operations. 4.2.1.1.  Decontamination  Priorities.    Decontamination  operations  are  intended  to  help sustain  or  enhance  military  operations  in  CBRN  environments  by  preventing  or minimizing  mission  personnel  and  equipment  performance  degradation  by  reducing  or preventing casualties or loss of resources.  They include individual, team and unit actions to reduce, remove, weather, or neutralize the primary hazards from CBRN contamination.  Exposed  skin  is  the  priority  for  immediate  decontamination,  followed  by  the  protective mask  and  hood,  overgarment,  personal  weapon  and  other  individual  equipment.  Decontamination actions beyond the immediate and operational level are manpower time and  resource  intensive  processes  and  generally  will  not  yield  satisfactory  results.  Decontamination efforts should be limited to actions that are necessary to permit mission accomplishment.    Refer  to  AFTTP  3-2.60.    Natural  decontamination  is  the  most  cost-effective  and  easiest  of  the  decontamination  methods,  however,  mission  needs  will  not always  allow  this  as  an  option.    Limit  decontamination  operations  to  those  actions necessary to minimize contact hazards and limit the spread of contamination to personnel and  equipment.    Decontamination  cannot  restore  all  assets  to  a  totally  uncontaminated condition. to decontaminants.    Biological  agents  and  radioactive  particles  too  small  to  see  will  enter cracks and crevices, and adhere to seam sealants, oil film, etc.   Some  resources  are  uniquely  sensitive to  chemical  agents  or 4.2.1.2.  Personnel  Decontamination  Operations.    Refer  to  AFTTP  3-2.60,  for  further guidance. 4.2.1.2.1.  Emergency  Decontamination  Capability  Description.    During  irregular warfare  activities,  the  HAZMAT  response  team  or  other  designated  personnel conduct  emergency  personnel  decontamination,  which  is  the  physical  process  of reducing the contamination from individuals in potentially life-threatening situations with  or  without  the  establishment  of  a  technical  decontamination  corridor.    This process  must  be  set  up  before  first  and/or  emergency  responder  teams  enter  the hazardous area or hot zone.  A mass decontamination station may be established in a separate  area  from  the  emergency  responder  decontamination  area  in  order  to decontaminate exposed personnel.  This is usually established by the first responding fire unit to expedite personnel in obtaining medical treatment. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   89  4.2.1.2.2.  Emergency  decontamination  is  used  when  response  personnel  or  base populace  members  encounter  a  life-threatening  situation  that  requires  immediate decontamination.   Emergency decontamination is  a gross decontamination  operation that  should  include  the  immediate  removal  of  contaminated  clothing  or  PPE,  and  a thorough washing as soon as possible, unless the water will cause an adverse reaction with the CBRN material.  For example, sulfuric acid reacts violently with water. 4.2.1.2.3.  Technical  decontamination  is  a  multi-step  process  in  which  contaminated personnel  are  cleansed  with  the  assistance  of  trained  personnel.    There  is  an  entry point  and  an  exit  point  with  a  decontamination  corridor  in  between.    For  non-radiological events, the entry point is set up in the hot zone, and the exit point is in the warm zone close to the cold zone.  Most of the contamination is removed in the initial steps  of  the  process.    For  radiological  events,  in  order  to  keep  doses  as  low  as reasonably  achievable,  the  decontamination  area  will  be  set  up  just  inside  the  warm zone where it transitions to the cold zone. 4.2.1.2.4.  Technical  Decontamination  Corridor.   A  technical  decontamination corridor will be established from the outer perimeter of the hot zone to the cold zone.  This  corridor will be used exclusively for emergency  responders  working  in  the hot zone  accomplishing  different  tasks  attempting  to  mitigate  the  situation.    The installation  HAZMAT  response  team,  or  other  designated  personnel,  will  be responsible for setting up the corridor and ensuring that the appropriate methods and materials  are  used  to  decontaminate  the  team.    An  emergency  decontamination  site may be set up to process individuals in potentially life-threatening situations with the immediate removal of contaminants. 4.2.1.2.5.  Contamination  Control  Area  (CCA)  Capability  Description.   The Readiness  and  Emergency  Management  Flight  is  the  OPR  for  establishing  the installation‘s  CCA  capability  to  process  and  decontaminate  personnel  exposed  to liquid, solid, aerosol or vapor chemical, biological, and radiological agents.  Although the  equipment  and  procedures  are  primarily  designed  for  these  types  of  warfare agents,  the  CCA  can  be  modified  for  use  with  personnel  contaminated  with TIC/TIMs. 4.2.1.2.5.1.  Prepare for Contamination Control Areas.  Preparation for CCAs is a function  of  contingency  planning.    The  two  focal  points  of  the  contingency planning  process  are  identifying  the  CCAs  in  advance  of  an  incident  and developing  appropriate  strategies  for  their  use.    This  includes  deciding  whether fixed  CCA  locations  will  be  used,  a  mobile  CCA  operation  will  be  used,  or  a combination of both.   It  also includes determining, in combination with  Aircrew Flight  Equipment  personnel,  whether  aircrew  CCAs  will  be  collocated  with ground  crew  CCAs.    Planners  and  operators  need  to  develop  procedures  and designate  areas  for  mask  refurbishment,  weapons  decontamination  and  storage, and  trash  disposal  (discarded  contaminated  equipment,  and  waste  generated  by shelters and CCA operations).  Local plans must outline the required procedures to  coordinate  with  the  LRS  or  logistics  activity  and  Civil  Engineers  to  obtain water,  supplies  and  equipment  for  CCA  stocking  and  re-supply.    Training programs and budgetary support must include training for designated attendants in CCA  setup,  conduct,  and  management.    Refer  to  Attachment  9  for  CCA   90  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 procedures. 4.2.1.2.5.2.  Contamination  Control  Area  (CCA)  Teams.    CCA  teams  are responsible for managing collective protection shelters as well as open air CCAs.  This includes site selection, timing, and method of equipment delivery and set-up, assignment  and  training  of  processing  line  attendants,  IPE  component  aeration and/or  refurbishment,  decontamination,  and  disposal  activities.    CCA  teams  are activated  by  the  EOC  and  are  managed  by  the  CBRN  Control  Center.    These individuals  will  work  closely  with  EM  personnel  assigned  as  contamination control  or  shelter  management  points  of  contact  (POC).    CCA  teams  are  unique because  they  are  working  in  an  originally  clean  environment  with  the  base populace coming to them in a contaminated state.  Contamination avoidance and control are essential. 4.2.1.3.  Resource Decontamination Operations.  CBRN contamination should be avoided when  possible.    When  this  is  not  possible,  personnel  and  equipment  must  be decontaminated  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  risk  to  personnel  and  to  make  equipment serviceable.    Decontamination  procedures  should  not  degrade  the  performance  of personnel or equipment and should not harm the environment.  Refer to AFTTP 3-2.60, for further guidance on the levels of decontamination and the associated decontamination operations in a CBRN environment. 4.2.1.3.1.  Conventional  warfare  decontamination  priorities.    In  wartime,  manpower and time are critical resources that cannot be wasted on nonessential tasks or efforts that  will  not  produce  operationally  relevant  results.    Therefore,  the  decontamination of  areas,  facilities,  and  equipment  will  be  prioritized  and  limited  by  necessity,  to allow  resumption  of  operations  by  protected  personnel.    Priorities  will  be  directly impacted by the mission with the realization that protected personnel can work with contaminated  equipment.    Therefore,  decontamination  must  be  aimed  at  restoring mission  capability  rather  than  totally  minimizing  hazards.    When  determining  if decontamination  is  required,  planners  should  consider  essential  requirements  in conducting decontamination operations listed in Table 4.1  If decontamination is not possible  or  needed,  contaminated  areas  may  be  marked  and  non-mission-essential restricted from use. Table 4.1.  Essential Requirements for Conducting Decontamination Operations Identification of contamination. Designation and marking of contaminated area. Identification of facilities, equipment, and material that have been contaminated. Availability of personnel to fully complete decontamination operations within the required timeframe. Number and deployment or utilization of decontamination personnel. Selection of appropriate decontaminant and decontamination equipment. Selection of an effective method of decontamination. Ability to verify effectiveness of decontamination. 4.2.1.3.1.1.  The first priority will be given to personal decontamination to prevent casualties and reduce manpower losses. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   91  4.2.1.3.1.2.  The  second  priority  will  be  the  decontamination  of  equipment  and material or facilities necessary to meet mission requirements as established by the commander. 4.2.1.3.1.3.  During wartime, decontamination operations will be expedited as the situation requires.  Primary considerations will be for effective accomplishment of the mission. 4.2.1.3.2.  Decision to Decontaminate.  The installation commander should decide to decontaminate  through  a  risk  assessment  process  that  evaluates:  technological capability to achieve the desired results, the need to increase mission operations, the ability to  reduce MOPP levels, and troops and resource availability.  Immediate and operational  decontamination  efforts  are  not  as  manpower  or  resource  intensive  as thorough or clearance decontamination.  These should be factors in the commander‘s decision to determine what level of decontamination will be conducted.  The levels of decontamination are shown in Table 4.2   92   Table 4.2.  Levels of Decontamination AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Levels Techniques Purpose Best Start Performed Immediate  Personnel wipe down Saves lives Stops agent penetration Limits agent Spread Immediate Operator wipe down of IPE and equipment Operational Spot decontamination of areas that must be touched or used Operational MOPP Gear Exchange (CCA Operations) Stops agent penetration Limits agent spread Stops agent penetration Limits agent spread Provides temporary relief from MOPP 4 Limits agent spread Operational  Equipment wash down Limits agent spread Thorough Clearance Detailed Equipment Decontamination (DED) Detailed Aircraft Decontamination (DAD) Detailed Troop Decontamination (DTD) Detailed Equipment Decontamination (DED) Detailed Aircraft Decontamination (DAD) Detailed Troop Decontamination (DTD) Limits agent spread and may lead to reduction of MOPP level Unrestricted use of resources By Individual or buddy Time Within 15 minutes (for biological or radiological and 2 minutes for chemical) Within 15 minutes Individual or crew Within 1 Individual or hour crew Within 6 hours Within 1 hour (non-CARC) or within 6 hours (CARC) When mission allows or during reconstitution operations When mission allows or during reconstitution operations CCA Team Crew Contamination control teams Supporting strategic resources individual  or crew  decision 4.2.1.3.2.1.  The immediate decontamination  will  minimize  casualties  and  limit  the  contact  hazard.    This applies  the  ―speed  and  need‖  principles  of  decontamination.    Following decontamination,  the unit  continues to  ―fight  dirty.‖  The unit‘s MOPP provides protection;  however,  continued  wearing  of  MOPP  gear  causes  performance degradation. to conduct 4.2.1.3.2.2.  The unit or activity decision to conduct operational decontamination AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   93  will provide temporary relief from MOPP 4 and limit the spread of contamination.  Operational  decontamination  supports  sustained  unit  operations  for  prolonged periods  and  is  used  to  limit  the  spread  of  contamination  by  removing  the contamination from areas that must be touched to enter a facility, vehicle, aircraft, or other resources as well as to conduct maintenance on these resources. 4.2.1.3.2.3.  The command decision to conduct thorough decontamination equates to reducing contamination below the detectable level with tactical-level detection equipment.    Caution  should  be  exercised  and  use  of  highly  sensitive  detectors such as the HAPSITE should be considered, when available and when it will not delay  treatment  of  injured  or  ill  personnel,  to  verify  the  effectiveness  of decontamination.  Current tactical chemical detectors are not sensitive enough to ensure  that  the  item  does  not  off-gas  when  the  temperature  rises.    Units  can operate  at  increased  temperatures  without  the  degradation  imposed  by  higher MOPP  levels.    The  commander  determines  which  assets  are  critical  for  a subsequent  mission  and  if  the  technological  ability  to  effectively  decontaminate the  resource  exists,  allocates  the  resources  to  conduct  Detailed  Equipment Decontamination  (DED)  and  Detailed  Troop  Decontamination  (DTD).    The commander accepts the trade-off that the contaminated assets and personnel will not  be  available  for  the  period  of  time  required  to  conduct  a  thorough decontamination. 4.2.1.3.3.  Levels  of  decontamination.   When  a  CBRN  incident  occurs,  the commander  must  decide  whether  decontamination  is  required  to  restore  combat power  and,  if  so,  what  level  of  decontamination  is  required.    The  initial  decisions regarding immediate and operational decontamination are time-critical.  These levels of  decontamination  save  lives  and  help  to  regenerate  and  maintain  combat  power.  The  units  and  activities  affected  will  continue  their  primary  mission.    However,  the level  of effort  required for thorough  and clearance decontamination  will remove the resource for extended periods from its mission.  Decontamination is not a sequential process  that requires the conduct  (in order) of immediate, operational,  and thorough decontamination.  For example, weathering may alleviate the requirement to conduct thorough decontamination. 4.2.1.3.4.  Principles of Resource Decontamination.  Personnel perform higher levels of  decontamination,  such  as  resource  decontamination,  because  of  risk  assessment.  Personnel should consider the following: 4.2.1.3.4.1.  Speed.    Personnel  should  conduct  decontamination  operations  as soon after the event as possible, if decontamination is deemed necessary.  Direct exposure to some, CBRN and TIC/TIM agents may create resource casualties and could  contaminate  a  resource  to  the  point  that  it  cannot  be  decontaminated effectively  within  minutes.    The  sooner  equipment  is  decontaminated,  the  less likely it is to absorb the agent or spread to other surfaces. 4.2.1.3.4.2.  Need.    Decontaminate  only  what  is  necessary.    Decontamination resources  are  limited  and  consequently  should  only  be  expended  where  they  are needed. 4.2.1.3.4.3.  Priority.  Decontaminate the most essential items first; foremost will   94  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 be  an  individual‘s  skin  if  contact  has  occurred.    Once  wearing  protective equipment, personnel should begin decontamination operations by priority and in sequence on clothing, equipment, and vehicles. 4.2.1.3.4.4.  Limited  Area.    Personnel  should  perform  decontamination  near  the area  where  the  contamination  has  occurred.    This  limits  the  spread  of contamination to other areas and reduces the time spent traveling. the level  of residual  hazard  prior 4.2.1.3.4.5.  Use  of  detectors.    Whenever  suitable  detectors  are  available,  they should  be  used  to  determine  if  an  item  is  contaminated,  the  location  of  the contamination,  and to  conducting decontamination  operations.    Detectors  should  then  be  used  to  verify  the effectiveness of decontamination once the operation has been completed.  In some cases, as with radiological contamination, this is easily achieved as our detectors can detect radiation essentially down to ―background‖ levels.  Unfortunately, this capability  does  not  exist  for  the  other  types  of  contamination.    Chemical  and TIC/TIM detectors have threshold sensitivity and agent identification challenges, and  current  biological  equipment  does  not  allow  the  field  identification  of contamination on resources in a timely manner. 4.2.1.3.4.6.  Operating  Environment.    The  allowable  decontamination  activities, level  of  decontamination  required,  and  the  speed  at  which  it  must  be accomplished  will  be  tremendously  influenced  by  whether  or  not  the  operating environment  is  home  station  peacetime,  deployed  contingency,  or  wartime.    For example, in a home station peacetime environment, it is unlikely that the flying of chemically or biologically contaminated aircraft will be allowed even though that action may be the most effective decontamination technique for the exterior of the aircraft. 4.2.1.3.4.7.  Inspections.    In  some  cases,  following  exposure  to  certain  TIC/TIM for instance, the CBRN material may degrade the serviceability of a component of the equipment item over time.  For example, TIC/TIM agents have been shown to degrade webbing and other cotton and petroleum-based products by 25% or more as time passes.  Further, tensile strength of materials and electrical contacts within electronic  parts  may  be  adversely  affected.    Consequently,  in  conjunction  with appropriate  decontamination  activities,  the  incorporation  of  more  frequent mechanical and electrical inspections may be required. 4.2.1.3.5.  Forms of Resource Contamination. 4.2.1.3.5.1.  Vapor.    Vapors  can  be  generated  by  generators,  bursting  munitions, or  from  evaporating  liquids.    Once  the  source  of  the  vapor  has  been  expended, vapor  in  an  open  or  outdoor  area  will  generally  disperse  rapidly.    Vapor contamination  is  likely  to  exist  in  the  aftermath  of  chemical  attacks,  and  vapors will likely be the primary hazard following TIC/TIM and biological attacks, while not  being  present  in  radiological  events.    Non-porous  portions  of  resources  will not  be  affected  by  vapor  contamination;  however,  very  porous  surfaces  such  as cloth can absorb chemical and TIC/TIM vapors and become a low-level residual off-gassing hazard. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   95  4.2.1.3.5.2.  Liquid.    Chemical  agents  are  typically  disseminated  as  liquids,  and most  TIC/TIM  start  out  as  liquids.    Radioactive  particles  falling  into  puddles  or pools will contaminate the liquid and rain falling onto radiologically contaminated surfaces may result in contaminated runoff.  Liquid droplets can range from thick and  sticky  to  the  consistency  of  water.    The  removal  of  liquid  contamination before  it  absorbs  into  materials  is  the  primary  challenge  associated  with  the decontamination of chemical agents. 4.2.1.3.5.3.  Aerosol.  An aerosol is  a liquid or solid composed of finely  divided particles  suspended  in  a  gaseous  medium.    Examples  of  common  aerosols  are mist, fog, and smoke.  In limited ways, they behave much like vapors. 4.2.1.3.5.4.  Solids.    Solid  forms  of  contamination  include  radioactive  particles, biological  spores, and dusty chemical  agents.   A dusty  chemical  agent  is a solid particle  that  has  been  impregnated  with  the  liquid  agent  and  subsequently disseminated  as  an  aerosol.    CBRN  materials  delivered  in  solid  form  do  not absorb into resource surfaces but the small particles do easily penetrate the cracks and crevices of an item and adhere to oil, grease, seam sealants, etc. 4.2.1.3.6.  Transmission Hazards Among Resources. 4.2.1.3.6.1.  Transfer.  Some items that contact a surface contaminated with liquid or solid contamination may pick up that contamination and potentially transfer it from that object to another. 4.2.1.3.6.1.1.  The  probability  of  transfer  for  chemical  agents  is  mostly dependent upon the absorbance characteristics of the agent and the type(s) of surfaces  involved,  although  drop  size  also  plays  a  role.    Table  4.3, summarizes  the  results  of  chemical  agent  transfer  tests  involving  the  nerve agent  VX.    When  it  comes  to  chemical  agents,  the  time  of  contact  with  the residual  contamination  is  of  only  minor  importance  in  the  overall  transfer problem.  AD-B086974, A Factorial Study of the Transfer Characteristics of Neat and Thickened CW Agents GD and HD, August 1984, showed that agent transfer  happens  immediately.    There  was  no  difference  between  a  1-second touch  and  a  15-minute  contact  with  the  contaminated  surface.    However, different materials have different transfer potential; IPE overgarments picked up 2.5 times more agent than rubber gloves.   96  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Table 4.3.

The pick-up mechanism for all trials was one revolution of a denim-cloth covered 70 kg roller approximately 24 by 42 inches in size. 4.2.1.3.6.1.2.  Biological agents can be transferred from different surfaces for at least four hours.  The presence of moisture increased the transfer potential from hand to hand generally more than transfer from hand to surface.  Table 4.4,  shows  the  transfer  efficiencies  of  different  biological  viruses  and  non-spore  forming  bacteria.    The  factors  that  influence  the  transfer  potential  for biological  agents,  in  order  of  importance,  are  contact  frequency,  amount  of contamination  on  the  surface(s),  duration/pressure/friction  of  contact,  and moisture.

The PRD1 bacteriophage is a virus that only infects bacteria. **Non-spore forming bacteria.  Serratia rubidea has been used as a plague (Y Pestis) stimulant.  4.2.1.3.6.2.  Spread.   Touching  a  surface  covered  with contamination can spread contamination on that same surface. liquid  or  solid 4.2.1.3.6.3.  Desorption.    Liquid  chemical  contamination  absorbs  into  porous material.    Once  absorbed,  it  begins  to  produce  toxic  vapors  as  the  liquid evaporates from the surface. 4.2.1.3.7.  Methods of Resource Decontamination. 4.2.1.3.7.1.  Neutralization  is  the  most  widely  used  method  of  decontamination, particularly  for  chemical  warfare  (CW)  agents.    Neutralization  is  the  reaction  of the  contaminating  agent  with  other  chemicals  to  render  the  agent  less  toxic  or nontoxic.  When mixed with a reactive decontaminant, the agent is converted into other  substances  (i.e.,  reaction  products).    The  reactive  decontaminant  may  be  a commonly  available  material  or  a  specifically  designed  decontaminating  agent.  Neutralization is not an option for radioactive materials. 4.2.1.3.7.2.  Physical  removal  is  the  relocation  of  the  contamination  from  one mission-critical  surface  to  another  less  important  location.    Physical  removal generally  leaves  the  contamination  in  toxic  form.    It  is  often  combined  with  the subsequent  neutralization  of  the  contamination.    For  example,  if  soap  and  water are  used  to  remove  the  agent,  the  runoff  may  be  drained  into  a  pit  containing  a high chlorine solution.  Depending on mission requirements, physical removal can be an effective technique without subsequent neutralization.   98  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 4.2.1.3.7.3.  Weathering involves such processes as evaporation and irradiation to remove or destroy the contaminant.  The contaminated item is exposed to natural elements (e.g., sun, wind, heat, precipitation) to dilute or destroy the contaminant to  the point of reduced  or negligible hazard.  This  may be as simple as letting a vehicle sit in the hot desert sun to bake off the contaminant.  Natural weathering is the simplest and most often preferred method of decontamination, particularly for terrain  and  non-mission-essential  buildings  and  roads.    Weathering  is  normally not an option for radioactive contamination in the aftermath of a terrorist incident involving an RDD, but may be an option in the aftermath of nuclear detonations (IND or tactical/strategic weapons). 4.2.1.3.8.  Specific Resource Decontamination Considerations. 4.2.1.3.8.1.  Patient  Decontamination.    Decontamination  of  casualties  protects them from the detrimental effects of contamination and protects those who move and  treat  them.    Units  and  individuals  have  the  responsibility  for  immediate decontamination  of  casualties  during  the  Self-Aid  Buddy  Care  (SABC)  process.  This  will  be  done  as  soon  as  contamination  is  suspected  or  found  and  prior  to moving  casualties  to  the  medical  facility;  quick  action  saves  lives.    Upon completion  of  SABC  efforts,  units  will  move  contaminated  casualties  into  the medical  treatment  system  as  soon  as  possible,  even  if  decontamination  is  not complete.    The  Medical  Treatment  Facility  (MTF)  will  plan  for  and  provide patient decontamination dependent on local threat conditions.  This capability will normally  be  provided  by  the  In  Place  Patient  Decontamination  Team.    Under some circumstances the wartime patient decontamination team, if deployed due to the  CBRN  threat,  may  provide  this  capability.    Commanders  at  the  employment location may need to provide manpower augmentation to the medical unit  in the event of insufficient medical resources.  In all instances, patient decontamination will  be  conducted  IAW  AFTTP  3-42.32,  Home  Station  Medical  Response  to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Events. 4.2.1.3.8.2.  Medical Litters Decontamination.  It is unlikely that installations will be  able  to  effectively  decontaminate  chemically  contaminated  medical  litters made  from  canvas  and  wood.    Insofar  as  the  Decontaminatable  Litter  is concerned, apply a five percent chlorine solution to the entire surface of the litter, handles, and poles.  Use the M295 decontamination kit if the chlorine solution is not  available.    It  is  highly  unlikely  that  medical  litters  will  become  physically contaminated  with  TIC/TIM,  but  if  this  does  happen,  the  decontamination technique  will  depend  on  the  TIC/TIM  involved.    For  example,  some  TIC/TIM react adversely with water (Diborane for instance) so chlorine slurries would not work,  and  the  use  of  chlorine  solutions  to  decontaminate  a  litter  contaminated with  chlorine  is  not  appropriate.    Radiological  decontamination  is  accomplished by  physically  removing  the  radioactive  particles  by  brushing,  use  of  industrial HEPA vacuum, use of adhesives (tape), etc. 4.2.1.3.8.3.  Vehicle  and  Equipment  Decontamination.    With  the  exception  of  a vehicle that is contaminated by a large amount of radioactive particles (producing dose  rates  that  are  unsafe  for  vehicle  operators),  there  is  generally  no  need  for extensive  vehicle  decontamination  as  long  as  contaminated  vehicles  are  clearly AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   99  than  1  hour  after  contamination. identified as containing a residual CBRN hazard; operators will be able to use the vehicle  as  long  as  they  wear  the  appropriate  IPE.    Vehicle  decontamination operations will not produce significant results once chemical agents have sorbed into  the  paint  or  other  surfaces.    Consequently,  where  chemical  agents  are concerned, vehicle  and equipment  operators must expediently decontaminate the parts that will continuously be touched as soon as possible after the attack but no later   The  operator  will  use  M295 decontamination  kits.    Operators  and  passengers  should  place  plastic  or  some other  barrier  material  on  vehicle  seats  if  the  area  or  their  ensembles  are contaminated  with  chemical  agents.    It  is  unlikely  that  vehicles  and  equipment will  be  contaminated  with  TIC/TIM  or  biological  agents,  and  if  they  are, weathering  is  likely  to  be  the  most  effective  decontamination  technique.  Radiological  decontamination  is  accomplished  by  physically  removing  the radioactive  particles  by  rinsing  with  water,  brushing,  use  of  industrial  HEPA vacuum  on  inside  surfaces  of  vehicle,  etc.    In  the  case  of  radiological decontamination,  use  available  detectors the  effectiveness  of decontamination.    If decontamination  is  desired after  a biological  attack, the use of a wet cloth to wipe surfaces with a 5 percent chlorine solution is the best option in most cases. to  verify for  both  chemical  and  biological  contamination, 4.2.1.3.8.4.  Weapons  Decontamination.    Many  weapons  may  be  extremely  hard to  decontaminate  completely  because  of  lubricants  that  trap  agents  or  perforated handguards  that  allow  small  chemical  droplets  to  get  into  hard  to  reach  places.  Contaminated  weapons  should  be  operationally  decontaminated  within  minutes after  exposure  if  possible  using  the  M295  or  RSDL  decontamination  kit.    Use water-soaked  rags  to  remove  the  decontamination  kit's  powder  residue.    When feasible, thoroughly decontaminate the weapon by disassembly and soaking in a five percent chlorine solution.    Table  4.5.,  depicts  the  half-life  of  the  chemical  agents  HD  and  VX  in five percent chlorine solutions.  The half-life is defined as the time that it takes for half of the initial amount to undergo reaction.  Always wear gloves when cleaning previously  contaminated  weapons.    Decontaminate  the  weapons  cleaning  tools (cleaning rod and brush) with a 5 percent chlorine solution.  Dispose of the used weapons  cleaning  materials  as  contaminated  waste.    Previously  contaminated weapons may become inhalation hazards to unmasked personnel within closed or unventilated  areas.    If  stored  inside  a  collective  protection  area  or  other unventilated area, the weapon should be double wrapped in plastic bags to contain the residual hazard and prevent exposures to low level chemical vapors whenever a previously contaminated weapon is not required for immediate use.   100  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011  Table 4.5.

Pallet  Decontamination  Considerations.    The  proper  chemically protective  packaging  of  the  pallets  must  be  accomplished  in  order  to  maximize contamination  avoidance  and  cargo-handling  effectiveness in  a  CBRN environment.  (Note:  Do not conduct the following activities until after the liquid deposition  phase  is  complete.)    Personnel  responsible  for  pallets  will  determine, report, and annotate the contamination status of each pallet.  In addition, they will remove and replace the covering if a single sheet of contaminated barrier material protected  the  contaminated  assets.    These  tasks  must  be  accomplished  within  6 hours of initial contamination.  The pallet handlers must carefully roll the material so the contaminated side rolls to the inside.  They will dispose of the material as contaminated waste.  Personnel must remove the outer layer and replace it as time permits if a double or triple sheet of plastic or canvas protected the contaminated assets.  Dispose of the barrier material as contaminated waste at a pre-determined location.  Identify the item as contaminated if barrier material did not protect the contaminated  property.    Mark  the  item  in  accordance  with  Air  Force  and installation  procedures.    Attach  both  signs  to  the  property  if  more  than  one category of CBRN material contaminated the property. 4.2.1.3.8.6.  Aircraft  Decontamination.    Aircraft  decontamination  is  the  most complex  and  multi-faceted  decontamination  activity  on  the  installation.    This complexity  encompasses  a  number  of  factors  the  multitude  of  surfaces  on  the interior and exterior of aircraft.  The constraint that chlorine cannot be used as a decontaminant; crew members may have to be inside the contaminated aircraft for 12 continuous hours or more on selected missions; and the fact that aircraft depart the installation and are scheduled or may be forced to land at other locations.  As an  overarching  technique  for  all  CBRN  materials,  spot  decontamination  is  an immediate decontamination technique that will normally be performed on aircraft AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   101  that  have  been  recovered  and  will  be  quickly  turned  around  for  continued  flight operations.    Spot  decontamination  reduces  the  contamination  on  areas  that  must be touched during an operation and while servicing the aircraft.  Conducting spot decontamination  will  reduce  contamination  and  limit  its  spread.    If  mission requirements  do  not  allow  ample  time  for  weathering,  then  provide  spot decontamination  for  fighter  and  large  frame  aircraft.    Table  4.6,  summarizes immediate aircraft decontamination.    In  the  event  that  thorough  or  clearance  decontamination  is required, this activity will be conducted when time allows and potentially extreme measures, such  as the replacement of interior coverings  and seating, are  feasible options.    These  activities  will  be  accomplished  by  specialized  teams  who  have access  to  the  most  sensitive  detectors  and  most  effective  decontamination technologies  available  as  opposed  to  being  accomplished  by  individual  crew chiefs and maintenance crews. decontamination operational and techniques for   102  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011  Table 4.6.

Also, increased inspections will be necessary to ensure electronics are working properly; the potential degradation will likely occur over time.   ° Whenever operationally feasible and useful (remainder of area is not already contaminated), the water from rinse activities should be funneled into a runoff area that can subsequently be AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   103  treated/removed.   ◊ Test results have shown water is nearly as effective as a five percent chlorine solution for removing biological spores from vehicles (96.8% for water; 98 percent for chlorine solution).  However, water did not kill the spores in the runoff containment area while the chlorine solution did significantly reduce the spore count over time.

High-Test  Bleach  (HTH)  neutralizes  most  chemical  and  biological agents,  given  sufficient  contact  time.    HTH  is  a  chlorine  material  in  granular  or tablet  form,  containing  a  minimum  of  70  percent  calcium  hypochlorite.    The compound  contains  a  higher  percentage  of  chlorine  than  STB  and  is  therefore more  corrosive.    Properly  diluted  HTH  can  be  used  for  the  decontamination  of individuals and personal protective material.  HTH will not blister paint during a decontamination  operation  that  includes  a  pre-rinse  and  post-rinse;  however,  it can severely corrode metals. 4.2.1.3.9.2.  Super  Tropical  Bleach  (STB)  neutralizes  most  chemical  and biological agents, given sufficient contact time.  STB is a mixture of chlorinated lime and calcium oxide in a white powder form.  STB, in a diluted solution, can be substituted for household bleach.  When manufactured, it contains 30 percent available  chlorine.    STB  can  be  expected  to  cause  serious  degradation  of electronic  equipment,  it  is  corrosive  to  most  metals,  and  it  is  injurious  to  most fabrics.  It has a slight effect on nonmetals and a moderate effect on sealants. 4.2.1.3.9.3.  Household  bleach  neutralizes  most  chemical  and  biological  agents, given  sufficient  contact  time.    It  is  normally  two  to  six  percent  sodium hypochlorite in water.  For vehicle wash-down, household bleach will corrode the metal parts of vehicles. Table 4.7.

Reactive  Sorbent  Powder  absorbs  and  neutralizes  most  chemical agents.    This  sorbent  is  a  free-flowing,  reactive,  highly  absorptive  powder.    The use  of  Reactive  Sorbent  Powder  decreases  decontamination  time  and  eliminates the need for water.  Note:  M295 kits are made with reactive sorbent powder. 4.2.1.3.9.5.  Inert sorbents uses materials that physically remove liquid chemicals from  surfaces  (e.g.,  skin).    Generally,  synthetic  sorbents  adsorb  liquids,  and natural sorbents absorb them.  The state of the liquid after sorption depends on the   104  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 type  of  sorbent  material  used.    For  simple  inert  sorbent  materials  such  as  soil, diatomaceous earth, activated charcoal, or some commercially available sorbents, the  liquid  remains  active  in  the  sorbent  material,  making  the  sorbent  material toxic. 4.2.1.3.9.6.  Soap  and  water  also  has  the  capability  to  neutralize  agents  to  some extent  by  the  chemical  method  of  slow  hydrolysis  but  is  mainly  used  to  remove agents.    However,  hydrolysis  is  limited  due  to  the  typically  low  solubility  and slow rate of diffusion of agents in water.  Contaminated surfaces may be wiped or scrubbed  with  soapy  water.    If  possible,  the  item  may  be  immersed  in  soapy water; however, since soapy water does not detoxify CB contaminants, the runoff water must be considered contaminated and precautions must be taken to prevent additional  CB  contamination.    Mustard  is  emulsified  and  carried  off;  it  is  not neutralized. 4.2.1.3.9.7.  Solvents.  The use of a solvent to remove a contaminant is a physical rather than a chemical process.  Chemical agents are removed from a surface by washing  the  molecules  away  using  water,  alcohol,  Freon,  diesel  fuel,  etc.    The agent  is  diluted,  but  not  detoxified,  and  there  may  be  residues  left  behind  in cracks,  pits,  joints,  etc.    Degreasing  solvents  are  noncorrosive,  water-dispersible liquids  that  are  commonly  used  to  clean  aircraft  and  automotive  engines  by absorbing  grease  and  oily  dirt.    Water,  preferably  under  pressure,  is  used  to remove the solvent and to flush the dirt, grease, oil, and chemical agents from the equipment.    The  solvent  action  of  the  liquid  varies  with  the  nature  of  the contaminated surface and the contaminant. remove CB processes contaminants 4.2.1.3.9.8.  Thermal through vaporization/desiccation  and  hasten  its  decomposition.    The  effectiveness  of  hot air decontamination varies with respect to the physical properties of the CB agent being  decontaminated  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  contaminated  material.    CB contaminants  distributed  over  a  nonporous  or  nonabsorbent  surface  are  readily removed  using  heat.    However,  if  the  CB  contaminants  are  distributed  over  a porous  or  absorbent  surface,  additional  heat  and  time  are  required  to  remove  it fully.   In other words, as the air temperature increases, the decontamination  rate increases.  Other factors, such as the humidity content within the air, velocity of the air, or the air exchange rates, will also influence the thermal decontamination process. 4.2.1.3.9.9.  High  temperature  saturated  steam  can  also  be  employed  to  remove CB contaminants.  Saturated steam is also used to remove grease and oil, as well as for sterilizing, disinfecting, degreasing, and degassing. 4.2.1.3.9.10.  Weathering  gradually  decomposes  CB  agents  by  aeration, hydrolysis,  and  evaporation.    The  time  necessary  for  decontamination  by weathering  depends  on  the  persistency  of  the  agent,  its  composition,  climatic conditions, and the type of surface.  Although weathering is the easiest method of decontamination,  persistency  of  an  agent  is  difficult  to  predict.    Therefore, mission  deadlines,  unfavorable  weather  conditions,  or  hazards  to  unprotected personnel may require the use of a faster method of decontamination. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   105  4.2.1.3.9.11.  Earth (Covering)  can be used to  seal  in  the  contamination  or as  an absorbent  for  the  contamination.    Covering  an  area  with  approximately  4  inches of earth gives protection from chemical agents as long as the earth is not disturbed and  the  chemical  agent  exposed.    Additional  protection  may  be  obtained  by mixing chlorine with the earth.  An area treated in this manner may be subjected to light use; however, periodic monitoring will be required. 4.2.1.3.9.12.  Fire.   Burning  reduces  the  amount  of  agent  and  increases decomposition.  The ideal conditions for the use of fire are during periods of lapse temperature  gradient  with  a  moderate  wind  speed  away  from  friendly  forces.  Burning  operations  could  cause  a  downwind  hazard  and  should  be  carried  out with caution. 4.2.1.3.9.13.  Caustic Soda (Sodium  Hydroxide or  Lye) dissolves easily in water or  alcohol.    Considerable  amounts  of  heat  are  generated  when  caustic  soda  is dissolved;  therefore,  containers  must  not  be  handled  with  bare  hands.    A  water solution of caustic soda will neutralize G agents on contact.  Caustic soda hastens the hydrolysis of lewisite.  However, mustard is neutralized only after prolonged contact with caustic soda.  An alcohol solution and caustic soda will neutralize BZ and VX agents. 4.2.1.3.9.14.  Ammonia (NH3) or Ammonium Hydroxide (NH4OH).  Ammonium hydroxide is  a water solution  of ammonia.  Ammonia or its water solution  is  an effective  decontaminant  (as  a  weak  hydroxide)  for  several  chemical  agents.  Ammonia  may  be  used  to  neutralize  G  agents;  however,  it  is  slower-acting  than caustic soda. 4.2.1.3.10.  Decontamination (Removal) Process for Radioactive Material.  Radiation is  a  result  of  changing  atomic  structure,  the  basic  building  blocks  of  all  things,  so radiation can never be eliminated.  The best decontamination method is to remove as much radioactive material as possible, as quickly as possible, to prevent its spread to other areas and to prevent its damage and uptake into the body.  Once contaminated, it is important to stay in the area, alert others in the area of the problem, and request assistance.    The  decontamination  process  for  six  commonly  found  radioactive elements is discussed in the following sections.  The processes may be applicable to other elements having similar chemical properties. 4.2.1.3.10.1.  Cesium  -  Cesium-137  emits  beta  and  gamma  radiation.    Cesium chloride  is  a  soluble  salt  and  is  known  to  adsorb  from  a  solution  onto  glass surfaces.   Decontaminating  a  cesium  liquid-contaminated  surface  is  best accomplished  by  wetting  the  surface,  absorbing  the  solution  with  a  rag  or  other absorbent material, and rinsing the area several times with water.  Contamination on  a  porous  surface  should  be  preceded  by  vacuuming  with  an  industrial  HEPA vacuum.    If the contamination persists, a detergent  solution  and scrub brush can be  used  to  scrub.    Metallic  surfaces  are  treated  with  strong  mineral  or  oxidizing acids.  Waxed surfaces can be removed. 4.2.1.3.10.2.  Cobalt  -  The  Cobalt  salt  is  a  beta  gamma  emitter  and  is  best decontaminated  with  a  detergent  or  an  ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  solution, followed by a treatment  with  mineral  acids.   Particles of cobalt dust adhering to   106  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 small articles are readily removed by ultrasonic cleaners or by dipping the article in  a  diluted  solution  of  nitric,  hydrochloric,  or  sulfuric  acid.    Cobalt-dust contamination  over  a  large  area  can  be  removed  by  vacuuming.    Contamination from solutions containing cobalt may be decontaminated with water. 4.2.1.3.10.3.  Plutonium  -  Plutonium  is  an  alpha  emitter.    Contamination  may result  from  a  nuclear  weapon  accident  and  may  be  scattered  as  a  metal  or  as  an oxide  dust,  both  of  which  are  insoluble.    Plutonium  contamination  that  covers  a small  area  can  be  removed  by  vacuuming.    The  area  should  be  washed  with  a detergent  solution  to  remove any remaining contamination,  and if contamination remains,  it  can  be  sealed  in  a  protective  coating  of  paint,  varnish,  or  plastic.  Plutonium oxide or metal dust spread over a large area, such as a field, should be decontaminated  by  removing  the  top  layer  of  soil  and  disposing  as  radioactive waste.    Personnel  should  wear  respiratory  protection  when  decontaminating  or moving the soil. 4.2.1.3.10.4.  Strontium - Strontium-90 is a beta emitter.  It is best decontaminated by  vacuuming,  followed  consecutively  by  a  water  treatment,  then  a  complexing agent solution, and then a mineral acid.  Contamination resulting from a dilution containing  strontium  should  be  decontaminated  by  absorbing  the  solution  and washing  the  area  with  a  detergent  solution.    If  strontium  contamination  persists, the  top  layer  of  the  surface  should  be  removed  by  abrasives  or  other  removal procedures and a sealing coat should be placed over the surface. 4.2.1.3.10.5.  Tritium - Tritium is a weak beta emitter.  If tritium is released to an area as a gas, the area should be flushed with air.  Objects exposed to tritium for a length of time may absorb the gas and should be disposed of.  Prior to disposing, they  may  be  degassed  under  a  vacuum  by  flushing  with  helium  or  hydrogen.  There is no practical way of removing tritium oxide (T20) from water because of its similarity to natural water.  Since inhalation of tritium can present an internal hazard,  personnel  entering  an  area  containing  tritium  gas  should  wear  an appropriate self-contained breathing apparatus. 4.2.1.3.10.6.  Uranium - Uranium is predominantly a beta emitter.  Contamination would  likely  occur  as  a  result  of  a  nuclear  weapon  accident  in  which  the fissionable  uranium  would  be  spread  as  a  metal  or  oxide  dust.    The  common isotopes of uranium contamination are uranium-235 and uranium-238, which are insoluble.    They  are  best  removed  from  a  contaminated  surface  by  brushing  or vacuuming,  followed  by  a  treatment  with  mineral  acids  or  oxidizing  acids,  and then  sealed.    Large-area  uranium  contamination  is  best  decontaminated  by removing the top layer of the surface or by sealing the area. 4.2.1.3.11.  Containment  systems  use  physical  measures  to  reduce  the  risk  and  the impact  of  decontamination  waste-water  from  contaminating  or  polluting  the surrounding  area.    Barrier  methods,  including  berms,  sand  bags,  pan  inserts,  drain seals and plugs, etc., create an obstacle in the pathway of decontamination wastewater and prevent any effluent from reaching the surrounding environment.  Pools, pumps, dikes,  etc.  can  be  used  to  collect  and  retain  the  decontamination  wastewater  at  the decontamination site. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   107  4.2.1.4.  Contaminated  Waste  Operations.    Contaminated  waste  operations  are  key  in recovery and in controlling the spread of contamination.  After a CBRN attack, there will be  vast  amounts  of  contaminated  waste  that  will  need  to  be  disposed  of  or  stored  until reconstitution  can  start.    Many  of  the  actions  for  contaminated  waste  operations  are covered under contamination control in Chapter 2. 4.3.  Contamination  Avoidance.  Contamination  avoidance  is  a  broad  area  that  includes  all  of the  actions  taken  to  minimize  the  impact  of  CBRN  contamination  on  operations.    Successful avoidance measures will significantly reduce--and often prevent--personnel, equipment, vehicle, aircraft  and  cargo  contamination.    Operational  advantage  is  gained  through  a  more  rapid reduction  of  protective  measures  and  a  reduced  requirement  for  personnel  and  equipment decontamination.    Measures  include  actions  such  as  limiting  contamination  from  entry  into facilities,  detection  and  identification,  prediction,  marking,  dispersal,  relocation  and  rerouting, and sampling.  Review specific contamination  avoidance actions to  ensure they do not  conflict with safety, fire prevention or functional area technical order requirements. 4.3.1.  Cover and Limit Entry.  The most effective way to avoid contamination is to prevent the  asset  from  becoming  contaminated  in  the  first  place.    Develop  low  or  no-cost  standing operating  procedures  to  put  equipment  that  is  not  being  used  under  overhead  cover.    If  the equipment cannot be placed under overhead cover, wrap or cover it with at least one layer of barrier  material  to  prevent  contamination.    Use  water  repellant  plastic  sheets,  canvas,  or tarpaulins.  Use two layers of cover so the top cover, along with any contamination, can be easily  removed,  safely  discarded,  and  replaced.    When  removing  contaminated  barrier material, remove and fold the material in a manner to encapsulate the contaminated surface.  Place  the  covers  in  containers  or  plastic  bags  and  neatly  stack  to  simplify  waste  removal.  Place  aircraft,  vehicles,  aerospace  ground  equipment,  munitions,  and  bulk  supplies  into shelters  or  under  overhead  cover.    Close  all  facility  windows,  turn  off  or  close  outside  air intake  ventilation  systems  at  the  time  of  attack,  and  implement  single-  entry  procedures.  Entries to  facilities should have foot-troughs and hand-troughs placed outside to  reduce the possibility  of  contamination  entering  the  facility.    Pre-plan  specific  actions  when  attack threats  increase.    Include  these  actions  within  the  alarm  condition  checklists.    When  attack warning  is  given,  personnel  should  accomplish  quick  and  easy  "last  second"  actions  to protect critical resources.  These actions may include placing tools, weapons, and equipment under  cover;  or  closing  aircraft  canopies,  building  and  vehicle  windows,  and  equipment access panels. 4.3.2.  Contamination  Avoidance  Detection.    The  detection  of  CBRN  agents  is  pivotal  to defining  the  correct  action  in  contamination  avoidance.    Detection  includes:  identification; protection and warning; treatment; verification; defensive warning (dewarning); and surface contamination. 4.3.2.1.  Detection and Identification.  CBRN agent detection and identification activities provide commanders with the information needed to determine protective postures and to tailor protective actions to the specific agent threats.  Early detection provides more time to implement protective measures.  Accurate identification of agents enables selection of the  most  effective  protective  actions,  including  medical  treatment,  and  limits  mission degradation  that  results  from  taking  unnecessary  actions.    CBRN  detection  and identification includes the use of point and standoff detection methods, risk assessment, and all available medical and non-medical intelligence assets.   108  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 4.3.2.2.  Detection  for  Protection  and  Warning.    Standoff  detection  provides  warning  in sufficient  time  to  implement  protective  measures  before  exposure  to  contamination occurs.    For  attacks  upwind,  detection  must  occur  at  sufficient  upwind  distances  to provide  a  reasonable  amount  of  time  for  detection,  processing,  and  information transmission.  Detection of the leading edge of the cloud is preferable, since it can give more  warning  time.    Warning  of  an  upwind  attack  may  come  from  upwind  detectors placed outside the installation or from other units monitoring the area upwind. 4.3.2.3.  Detection  for  Treatment.    Detection  for  treatment  is  focused  on  identifying  the type  of  agent  dispersed  in  an  attack  so  treatment  can  be  rendered  as  early  as  possible.  Some aspects of treatment are agent-specific; therefore, agent discrimination is extremely important.    Agent  sampling  and  analysis  continue  to  be  the  primary  means  of accomplishing  this  detection  role.    Sampling  is  a  local  action,  while  analysis  can  occur locally  or  at  designated  medical  laboratories,  depending  on  capabilities.    Medical personnel  collect  and  submit  clinical  samples  from  patients  and  perform  environmental sampling and detection functions. 4.3.2.4.  Detection  for  Verification.   Detection  for  verification  provides  critical information to the President of the United States and United States Secretary of Defense to support decisions concerning the need for tailored response and to select options in  a timely  manner.    Specific  procedures  for  sampling  and  transporting  samples  to  a laboratory  may  vary  depending  upon  the  installation  location  and  host  nation requirements.    Follow  theater  and  MAJCOM  direction  for  the  overall  process  and responsibilities for the collection and evacuation of samples for analysis. In the absence of guidance, use the sampling procedures contained in AFTTP(I) 3-2.44. 4.3.2.5.  Detection for Defensive Warning (Dewarning).  Detection for dewarning means; detecting  to  identify  when  contamination  reaches  levels  that  enable  removal  of  the protective  mask.    Use  various  types  of  surfaces  when  conducting  agent  detection.    For example, some chemical warfare agents will remain, or persist, much longer on glass and within shaded areas than on items such as painted surfaces, concrete, and asphalt. 4.3.2.6.  Detection for Surface Contamination.  Detection for surface contamination is the ability to detect deposited contamination on surfaces.  The results are used to determine the  need  for  immediate  or  operational  decontamination  and  appropriate  protective equipment.    They  may  support  the  need  to  use  alternate  routes  to  avoid  contaminated terrain  if  personnel  cannot  wait  the  short  time  period  required  for  agent  absorption.  Results may also be used to adjust protective measures for people handling contaminated resources. 4.3.3.  Handling  Contaminated  Equipment.    Contaminated  equipment  must  be  identified, decontaminated, properly marked, have the appropriate item records annotated, and reported to  the  UCC  for  tracking.    Supervisors  and  UCCs  should  monitor  and  direct  the  use  of uncontaminated resources, even within contaminated CBRN zones. 4.3.3.1.  Handling  Procedures  for  Chemically-Contaminated  Objects  (CCO)  (non-porous).    A  chemically-contaminated  resource  composed  of  metal  surfaces  will  retain  a residual  chemical  hazard  longer  than  the  terrain  surface  on  which  it  is  located.    As  a result,  installations  have  two  primary  choices  when  it  comes  to  handling  these contaminated resources.  The first choice is to leave the entire chemical zone in MOPP 4 AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   109  until  the  longer  of  the  two  hazards  duration  periods  has  passed.    The  second  choice, which is applicable to situations when the hazard duration from the major terrain surface is  less  than  that  from  the  contaminated  resource,  is  to  adopt  special  guidelines  for  IPE required  when  in  the  area  of  these  contaminated  resources.    The  second  choice  will always provide operational benefits to the installation because at least some of the people in the chemical zone will be able to adopt MOPP 2; however, to be effective this choice requires  a  well  trained  base  populace.    When  proper  handling  procedures  are  correctly implemented, mission operations will be easier and personnel will not be burdened with the MOPP 4 performance degradation effects. 4.3.3.2.  Refer  to  Table  4.8,  Chemically  Contaminated  Object  Rule  (CCOR)  Handling Guidelines  Background.    Negligible  risk  is  the  maximum  acceptable  risk  according  to this  method.    The  guidelines  were  calculated  based  on  one  hour  of  exposure  at  the distances specified as no longer requiring MOPP 4. Table 4.8.  Chemically Contaminated Object Handling Guidelines Background CCOR applies when chemical contamination is liquid in nature (e.g., this special handling procedures will not be necessary past the point of the hazard duration of the major terrain surface when the resource has been exposed only to agents in vapor or dusty form.). The use of the special handling procedures embodies a safety factor that goes beyond existing Department of Defense (DOD) guidance, which allows the removal of IPE whenever detectors no longer detect a chemical agent vapor hazard. The ―small object‖ category encompasses resources that have 10 square meters or less of metal and/or glass surfaces.  Examples include aerospace ground equipment (AGE), munitions trailers, munitions, and vehicles such as pick-up trucks, high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles (HMMWV), and one and one-half ton stake-bed trucks. The ―large object‖ category encompasses resources that have more than 10 square meters of metal and/or glass surfaces.  Examples include 44-passenger buses, fuel trucks, P-19 fire trucks, and all aircraft. 4.3.3.2.1.  The  times  associated  with  the  guidelines  are  not  absolute  guarantees  of safety.    The  AF  developed  the  guidelines  for  sustained  mission  operations  and  to prevent a few contaminated resources from unnecessarily driving the MOPP level in the  entire  CBRN  zone.    The  guidelines  do  not  automatically  equate  to  a  point  at which  personnel  may  safely  operate  for  indefinite  periods  in  close  contact  with  the resource.    Personnel  must  be  cognizant  of  the  circumstances  that  affect  the  time estimates  and  remain  alert  for  evidence  of  chemically-induced  symptoms  in themselves or co-workers. 4.3.3.2.2.  Installations  may  choose  to  employ  the  uncomplicated  generic  version  of the CCOR guidelines, or if operational circumstances and base population capabilities warrant, bases may choose to use the more advanced CCOR protocols. 4.3.3.3.  Simplified  CCOR  Guidelines.    To  simplify  response  processes,  commanders may choose to use the worst case scenario as the foundation for all declarations involving the handling of these contaminated resources in a zone that is otherwise considered safe for  MOPP  2  operations.    Under  the  generic  guidelines,  MOPP  reduction  in  a  zone  that has been contaminated will not be achievable for a minimum of one hour after the attack.   110  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Table 4.9.

Although a contact hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent may still be present.  The use of gloves will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact with agent residue is avoided.  4.3.3.4.2.  Advanced  Guidelines  for  Handling  Large  Contaminated  Objects.    The installation  may  choose  to  use  the  timelines  outlined  in  Table  4.10,  if  the  CBRN reconnaissance  team  has  the  ability  to  determine  whether  a  resource  was AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   111  contaminated at a density level of less than 50 mg/m², and if the base population has a mechanism  that  allows  them  to  determine  when  they  are  500  feet  from  a  large contaminated resource. 4.3.3.4.3.  Illustrative examples. 4.3.3.4.3.1.  Situation:    Small  contaminated  resources  move  into  chemical  zone that  only  requires  the  protection  afforded  by  MOPP  2.    In  this  situation,  the installation  should  use  the  ―small  object‖  guidance  contained  in  Table  4.9    In other words, after one hour has passed from the attack until 24 hours have passed since the time of attack, people would remain in MOPP 4 within 10 feet of small contaminated objects. 4.3.3.4.3.2.  Situation:    Attack  recovery  phase  on  airbase  when  a  contaminated resource  (aircraft)  moves  from  a  chemical  zone  currently  in  MOPP  4  to  a chemical zone that only requires the protection afforded by MOPP 2.  Under these circumstances,  the  goal  is  to  prevent  the  existence  of  a  limited  number  of contaminated  resources  from  driving  the  entire  otherwise  uncontaminated  zone into  MOPP  4.    In  this  situation,  the  installation  should  use  the  ―large  object‖ guidance  contained  in  Table  4.9,  for  the  time  of  1  to  3  hours  after  the  attack, people would remain in MOPP 4 if they were within the identified zone(s) of the contaminated resource(s).  From 3 to 24 hours after the attack, this MOPP 4 area will decrease from the entire zone(s) to 50 feet. 4.3.3.4.3.3.  Situation:  Contaminated aircraft lands at an uncontaminated airbase.  In  this  situation,  although  the  guidance  will  be  very  safe-sided  because  of  the decontamination  benefits  derived  from  flying  the  aircraft,  the  installation  should use the ―large object‖ guidance contained in Table 4.9. 4.3.3.4.3.4.  Situation:    Attack  recovery  phase  on  an  airbase  when  mission operations  can  be  completed  in  MOPP  4  within  timelines  specified  in  generic guidelines.    In  this  situation,  it  is  best  to  use  the  guidelines  contained  in  Table 4.10,  in  the  attack  recovery  environment.    Even  though  the  operational  risk  is negligible  or  low,  there  is  not  a  valid  need  to  increase  the  probability  of  risk  to personnel  if  no  operational  benefit  will  be  achieved.    This  information  is  only  a general  rule-of-thumb.    Once  the  specific  agent  is  identified,  the  anticipated chemical  duration  is  available  in  tables,  which  are  located  on  the  Air  Force Emergency Management Community of Practice. 4.3.3.4.3.5.  Situation:    Attack  recovery  phase  on  an  installation  when  critical mission operations cannot be completed in MOPP 4 within timelines specified in generic  guidelines.    Commanders  must  weigh  the  positive  and  negative,  short term and long term effects of each modification they chose to enact in situations where critical  mission operations can be completed using the  rules  embedded in Table  4.10    The  commander‘s  key  advisors,  Emergency  Management  and  BE personnel, should be consulted during this decision-making process. 4.3.3.4.3.6.  Situation:  If a chemical agent other than VX or R33 was used in the attack, it can be a safe decision to declare that ―MOPP 4 within 10 feet of a small contaminated  object‖  is  terminated  before  24  hours  in  accordance  with  the   112  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 timelines shown in  Table  4.10.  The 24-hour  aspect  of the  generic  guidelines is safety focused in regards to agents other than VX or R33.  Figure A5.2, provides examples  of  M8  paper  looks  like  with  the  various  levels  of  contamination  and includes 50 mg/m². 4.3.3.4.3.7.  Situation:  The acceptance of increased operational risk regarding the handling of large contaminated objects applies only to the time period beginning one  hour  after,  and  ending  three  hours  after,  a  chemical  attack.    Installations should  not  reduce  the  distance  of  MOPP  4  from  500  to  50  feet  from  a  large contaminated  object  during  this  time  unless  qualified  CBRN  reconnaissance personnel are sure the contamination density on the aircraft is less than 50 mg/m².  This is not an easy assessment to make since 50 mg/m² of contamination will look different based on the mass median diameter of the chemical droplets. 4.4.  Recovery Actions for Conventional and Irregular CBRNE Attacks.  Whether the attack is conventional or irregular, recovery actions following an attack are crucial.  The type of attack and  the  materials  or  agents  used  during  the  attack  will  drive  initial  actions  and  recovery  plan development. 4.4.1.  Analyze  CBRN  reconnaissance  and  damage  assessment  results.    Post  attack reconnaissance  reports  will  provide  the  installation  commander  with  a  common  operating picture  of  the  damage  and  contamination  on  the  installation.    Installation  commanders  will base their decision for recovery plan on the type of contamination; the extent of damage, the area contaminated, and mission priorities. 4.4.2.  Define  the  hazard  perimeter.    During  a  conventional  attack  with  CBRN  weapons, CBRN zones can be used to identify the hazard perimeter using all detection equipment and resources  available.    In  an  irregular  attack  the  hazard  perimeter  will  take  longer  to  define because there may not be adequate warning of an attack and detection equipment will not be pre-positioned before the attack.  Responders will have to  bring detection equipment  to  the attack location and determine where the hazard perimeter is located.  This mission capability is  further  defined  as  hazard  perimeter  definition  in  Attachment  3  of  this  Manual  under Emergency  Management.   For  additional  information,  refer  to  AFTTP  (I)  3-2.37, Multiservice  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  for  Nuclear,  Biological,  and  Chemical Aspects of Consequence Management. 4.4.3.  Conduct Hazard Identification.  Hazard identification occurs after the initial detection of  a  CBRNE  event.    Timely  and  accurate  CBRNE  hazard  detection,  identification,  and quantification  are  fundamental  capabilities  to  successful  recovery  and  mitigation  activities.  These capabilities provide the commander with an operationally significant understanding of the  threats  involved.    CBRNE  responders  maintain  the  routine  capability  for  CBRN (presumptive,  field  confirmatory,  theater  validation,  and  definitive)  identification  and  EOD maintains the explosives specific identification capability.  The Air Force possesses reliable detection and identification capabilities for radiological materials, in the forms of traditional radiation  detectors  and  specialized  radioisotope  identifiers.    Medical  laboratory  personnel maintain  the  capability  for  biological  identification  under  medical  treatment  conditions  and suspected  biological  attacks.    Current  chemical-biological  agent  detectors  used  by  CBRN reconnaissance  teams  do  not  detect  every  potential  agent  in  all  forms.    Chemical  detectors will  detect  field  concentrations  of  likely  wartime  agents  under  most  conditions.    Current AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   113  hand-held  biological  detectors  were  designed  to  detect  agents  at  the  source  of  the dissemination  e.g.,  letter  or  reservoir  in  spray  device.    These  detectors  are  not  sufficiently sensitive for testing swab samples from HVAC systems or extractions from dry filter units or Radeco  (or  equivalent)  air  samplers;  these  sorts  of  samples  should  be  tested  by  personnel using  the  JBAIDS  systems.   While  potentially  dangerous  to  human  health,  if  the  chemical-biological agent concentration is below the detector‗s sensitivity threshold level, the detector will not show agent presence.  This mission capability is further defined in Attachment 3 of this Manual under Emergency Management and Bioenvironmental. 4.4.4.  Hazard  Analysis.    Emergency  Management  personnel  will  collect  information  from initial  entry,  initial  facility/area  reconnaissance,  and  other  responder  teams  to  locate  and quantify ground/surface contamination.  Emergency Management personnel will use this data and  put  it  into  automated  hazard  prediction  programs  such  as  JEM  like  (JWARN,  HPAC, VLSTRAC,  ALOHA,  and  CAMEO)  along  with  DOD-approved  real-time  and  high-resolution  forecast  meteorological  input  data  to  conduct  hazard  analysis.    This  information will be used by the incident commander or the EOC director to determine the area affected by the attack or release.  It will assist the IC or EOC director if off base notifications need to be made to warn local residents of the attack or release.  This information will further define the area contaminated, which is critical for the IC or EOC director to recommend protective actions for those areas affected, and to  continue operations in those areas unaffected by the attack.    For  further  information  on  this  mission  capability,  see  Attachment  3  under Emergency Management. 4.4.5.  Considerations.    The  general  scheme  of  attack  recovery  actions  in  which  CBRN agents were used includes: control the situation; protect  yourself; prevent the situation from claiming  more  casualties;  rescue,  protect  and  treat  victims;  decontaminate  exposed  victims and  minimize  the  spread  of  contamination;  conduct  early  hazard  identification;  preserve evidence per the SOP, follow-on emergency response SOPs and operations plans (OPLANs); coordinate with local, State, Federal and HN agencies.  For irregular attacks, the hostile use of TIC/TIMs presents a large threat to airbases CONUS and OCONUS.  Most nations in the world  have  some  form  of  TIM  production,  storage  facility,  or  distribution  capability.    U.S. forces  frequently  operate  around  locations  where  there  are  TIMs,  TICs,  toxic  industrial biological  material,  toxic  industrial  radiological  materials  ,  radiological  industrial  chemical (RICs) and radiological industrial material (RIMs).  While the substances are generally less dangerous, TIC detection and identification is more difficult than working with standard CW agents.    While  there  is  detection  and  identification  equipment  and  methods  available  for TIC/TIM,  the  number  of  possibilities  makes  knowing  what  type  of  protection  and  when  to don protection more difficult.  Often there are no specific antidotes for TIM.  Self-protection is  the key to  successful response efforts.   When personnel  ensure their self-protection, they can save lives, minimize the spread of contamination and protect property. 4.4.6.  Split  MOPP  Operations.    Split  MOPP  operations  refer  to  separating  the  installation into several CBRN zones during conventional warfare activities to enable increased mission continuation  by  not  encumbering  personnel  that  are  not  in  contaminated  areas  with  the burden of MOPP 4.  The CAT and EOC can also use CBRN zones during irregular warfare activities to relay the location of contaminated or uncontaminated areas in the aftermath of an attack  involving  CBRN  materials.    See  more  details  on  Split  MOPP  and  setting  up  CBRN zones in Chapter 2.   114  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 4.4.7.  Standardized  Contamination  Marking  and  Documenting  Procedures.   CBRN contamination  hazard  prediction  allows  commanders  to  determine  the  probable  effect  of contamination  on  current  and  future  operations.    A  combination  of  manual  and  automated methods  is  available  to  predict  the  location,  movement,  and  intensity  of  contamination.  These  methods  use  post-attack  detector  data,  physical  observations,  and  automated predictions  to  identify  known  contamination  and  likely  hazard  areas.    Prediction  tools  and specialist expertise enable a rapid assessment of mission impact and a means to communicate contamination information to Higher Headquarters, joint service, and coalition forces. 4.4.7.1.  Contaminated resources should be marked and documented.  Contaminated areas may or may not have marking signs prominently positioned around the entire boundary.  During  conventional  warfare  situations,  it  is  not  necessary  to  place  contamination markers  around  the  boundary  of  each  affected  CBRN  zone;  the  contamination  status  is maintained  and  updated  at  the  CBRN  zone  transition  point.    Conversely,  it  is  entirely possible  that  small  areas  contaminated  by  RDDs  will  be  prominently  marked  during irregular warfare situations.  Individual pockets of CBRN contamination in an otherwise clean  area  (irregular  warfare  activities  or  contamination  from  widely  spaced submunitions  in  a  conventional  warfare  environment  for  instance)  must  be  located  and marked  as  soon  as  is  tactically  possible.    This  quick  action  allows  others  to  know  that precautions are required and avoids the need to send personnel to the site a second time.  Your  CEMP  10-2  or  other  appropriate  plan  must  outline  specific  marking  requirements for the installation. 4.4.7.2.  Marking  Contaminated  Vehicles.    When  marking  contaminated  vehicles,  the vehicle  operator  or  owning  unit  personnel  are  responsible  for  marking  and  reporting information to their UCC.  They are also responsible for annotating the AF Form 1800-series form with key information.  This information is also reported to vehicle operations dispatch  and  vehicle  maintenance  control  and  analysis  (MC&A).    MC&A  enters  the information  into  the  On-Line  Vehicle  Interactive  Management  System  (OLVIMS), consolidates  the  information  in  the  vehicle  historical  files  and  reports  contaminated vehicles to MAJCOM Transportation Division.  The MAJCOM Transportation Division forwards  this  information  to  AF/A4LE  and  Warner-Robins  Air  Logistics  Center  for  the item  manager's records.  .  OLVIMS will provide visibility of the vehicle‘s maintenance record and contamination status  to the installation, the MAJCOM, and the Air Staff.   If this  information  cannot  be  entered  into  OLVIMS,  MC&A  will  keep  a  master  log  of contaminated vehicles and record the contamination status in the vehicle's historical file. 4.4.7.3.  Standards for Marking Hazards. 4.4.7.3.1.  Standard  Marking.    Unless  otherwise  indicated,  during  conventional  or irregular  operations,  the  AF  uses  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO) signs to mark and identify contamination or hazards.  Refer to  Figure  4.1, Standard Nuclear,  Biological,  Chemical  and  Conventional  (NBCC)  Hazard  Markers.  Additional guidance for UXOs can be found in AFTTP (I) 3-2.12, UXO Multi-Service Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures for  Unexploded  Explosive  Ordnance Operations. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   115  Figure 4.1.  Standard Nuclear, Biological, Chemical and Conventional Hazard Markers  4.4.7.3.2.  When  using  the  Standard  NBCC  Hazard  Markers,  the  primary  or background color indicates the type of contamination and the secondary  color  gives specifics  on  the  hazard.    The  shape  of  the  sign  is  a  right  isosceles  triangle  with  its base  approximately  11  inches  and  the  sides  approximately  8  inches.    Post  the  signs with  the  tip  of  the  triangle  pointing  downward.    PAR  teams  may  also  use  the  NBC Marking  Kit.    The  kit  includes  everything  needed  to  mark  a  contaminated  area  – flags, ribbons, crayons, mounting stakes, and a carrying container. 4.4.7.3.3.  Expedient  Markers.    You  can  also  construct  expedient  markers,  such  as those  shown  in  Figure  4.2,  when  standard  markers  are  unavailable  or  impractical.  Construct  the markers to the approximate size and shape of the  examples using  any suitable  material.    Options  for  expedient  marking  include  locally  produced  marking signs or decals and the use of masking tape, chalk, or paint to mark the hazard.  If no markers  are  available, use any means to  mark the hazard that draws  attention  to  the problem  and  communicates  to  others  that  a  hazard  exists.    Expedient  marker  sizes may  vary  between  8  and  20  inches,  depending  upon  the  type  of  material  used  to   116  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 construct the marker and the size of the item to be marked.  These signs can be made using  any  available  material.    The  drawback  to  the  use  of  expedient  markers  is  that they  do  not  easily  allow  users  to  display  the  supplemental  hazard  information required when using pre-constructed hazard markers (name of agent, dose rate, time of  attack,  etc.).    See  AFTTP  3-2.44,  for  details.    When  the  hazard  has  dissipated, remove the expedient marker through whatever means are necessary (remove tape or decal, erase chalk, paint over area, etc.). Figure 4.2.  Expedient Nuclear, Biological, and Conventional Hazard Markers  4.4.8.  Develop  Recovery  Plan.    Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  CBRNE  attack,  extensive damage, mass casualties, and contaminated areas or equipment could result.  The installation commander  or  designated  representative  will  have  to  approve  the  recovery  plan  during conventional warfare activities.  See AFMAN 10-2502 for additional information regarding the development, coordination, and execution of the recovery plan.  The CEMP 10-2 contains executable tasks for developing a recovery plan in each appropriate Annex.  Key items that should  be  reviewed  during  the  recovery  plan  development  are:  damage  assessment  reports, contaminated equipment, contaminated areas and facilities listings, and casualty reports.  The recovery plan should be based upon an assessment of the long- and short-term impacts on the installation‘s  ability  to  conduct  mission  operations  due  to  damage  or  contamination,  and should address questions such as:  Are facilities or airfields available?  If the installation is contaminated  how  long  will  personnel  have  to  operate  in  IPE  or  PPE?    For  long  term AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   117  recovery after a conventional or irregular warfare attack, a recovery plan must be developed to  bring  the  installation  and  area  to  pre-incident  conditions.    The  recovery  plan  should address the following: 4.4.8.1.  Logistical support and resupply. 4.4.8.2.  Force protection. 4.4.8.3.  Documentation  and  reporting  requirements,  to  include  resource  expenditures, losses,  and  environmental  exposure  data  that  is  necessary  to  estimate  exposure  (to determine  long-term  and  short-term  health  effects  including  quantification  of  CBRN hazards.) 4.4.8.4.   Decontamination.  To include levels of decontamination and locations. 4.4.8.5.  Environmental  considerations  to  prevent  pollution  and  restore  the  area.    This should include any environmental studies and cleanup criteria. 4.4.8.6.  Sampling and Monitoring.   Include locations of laboratories where samples are shipped  if  not  done  at  the  installation.    Information  on  sample  collection  procedures should  be  referenced  here.    The  sites  or  areas  should  be  monitored  to  ensure contamination  is  not  spread  or  responders  or  private  workers  are  not  exposed  to  levels above prescribed guidelines.  Refer to AFTTP (I) 3-2.44 or see the Air Force Emergency Management  Community  of  Practice  for  more  specific  information  regarding  sampling timelines.  4.4.8.6.1.  The operational exposure guidelines depend on the mission's criticality and the  commander's  degree  of  acceptable  risk.    Since  one  of  the  goals  is  to  keep personnel exposures ALARA, and because sampling operations do not fall within the categories  of  "life  saving"  or  "critical  mission  operations",  sampling  operations should be considered as  "routine" missions unless unusual  circumstances  exist.   See Table A5.4, OEGs, for additional information. 4.4.8.7.  Medical  issues  to  include:  personal  protection,  casualty-handling  operations, medical screening, and documentation and traumatic stress response. 4.4.8.8.  PA activities. 4.4.8.9.  Liaison with Federal, State, local, and HN officials as required. 4.4.9.  Conventional  Warfare.    During  conventional  warfare  operations  a  written  recovery plan may not  be developed until  the war is  over  and reconstitution begins.  During  combat operations,  the  recovery  plan  is  verbalized  by  the  installation  commander  or  designated representative  through  objectives  or  priorities  based  upon  the  mission  the  installation  is tasked  with  at  the  time  of  the  attack.    For  example,  if  the  runway  is  damaged  and  the installation is tasked with a close air support mission in four hours then the focus is going to be getting the runway and all supporting functions operational to meet that mission.  The type of  material  used  in  the  weapons  (i.e.,  CBRN)  will  also  drive  actions  in  the  recovery  of  the installation, both short term and long term.  In the short term, installation leadership will have to  look  at  how  much  of  the  installation  was  affected  by  the  attack,  the  hazard  durations, casualty  management,  any  actions  that  can  be  taken  to  reduce  the  hazards,  personnel protection  measures,  and  how  long  will  personnel  remain  in  protective  equipment.    Long-term recovery or reconstitution actions plans will have to be developed to identify and record   118  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 contaminated  areas  to  include  contaminated  waste  sites,  contaminated  equipment  and aircraft, and contaminated remains. 4.4.10.  Irregular  Warfare.    The  recovery  plan  during  an  attack  by  irregular  forces  such  as terrorist organizations is developed as part of the Incident Action Plan (IAP).  If the incident affects the civilian community, the plan must be coordinated with civil authorities.  The plan must have clearly defined goals and objectives to ensure that tasks between civil authorities and  the  installation  commander  are  understood  and  completed.    Top  priorities  are reestablishing  mission  capability,  developing  a  plan  to  cover  short-  and  long-term  recovery requirements,  and  returning  to  normal  operations.    Special  consideration  is  given  to minimizing and mitigating environmental damage. 4.5.  Hazard Duration.  The calculation and verification of hazard duration timelines for CBRN materials  is  a complex endeavor  and has many variables  (see  Table  4.11).  Not  every  variable applies  to  every  category  of  CBRN  material.    For  example,  the  hazard  duration  timeline  for  a radioisotope  (Cesium  137  for  instance)  is  not  affected  by  meteorological  factors  while  these factors have a large influence on chemical and biological hazard duration timelines.  Utilize the following  resources  and  considerations  when  calculating  hazard  duration  timelines  for  CBRN materials. Table 4.11.  Factors Affecting Determination of Hazard Duration Timeline FACTORS AFFECTING DETERMINATION OF HAZARD DURATION TIMELINE Toxicity of the material involved Volatility and absorption characteristics of material involved Natural decay/dissipation rate of material involved Physical form of material involved (liquid, solid, gas) FOR CBRN MATERIALS Meteorological Factors (wind speed, temperature, humidity)  Type of terrain and resource surface (grass, sand, concrete, painted metal, etc.) Amount of material involved Acceptable residual hazard level (how clean is safe) Presence of precipitation, standing water, snow Delivery mechanism (missile, spray, mortar, etc.) Size of particulate or droplet of material involved Ability to verify presence and desired residual toxicity level of material through detectors 4.5.1.  Chemical  detectors  (JCAD,  ICAM,  M8  Paper,  M22,  etc.)  are  not  always  sensitive enough to register the presence of an unsafe liquid contact or vapor hazard.  Consequently, while  informative  in  the  process,  the  readings  from  these  detectors  are  not  the  sole justification for unmasking or otherwise lowering MOPP in  the aftermath  of an attack.  An exhaustive  review  of  scientific  literature,  and  live  agent  testing  from  several  technically sound sources, provides a framework for determining the probable hazard duration associated with  chemical  agents.   Contact  and Vapor Hazard Tables that address  many weapon-agent-surface-weather  combinations  are  available  through  the  Air  Force  Emergency  Management Community  of  Practice.    Units  will  use  these  tables,  in  conjunction  with  the  acquisition  of negative  detector  readings,  to  determine  hazard  duration  timelines  for  chemical  warfare agents. 4.5.2.  While work continues in this area, at this time hazard duration tables do not exist for biological  agents  to  the  same  degree  of  depth  as  those  available  for  chemical  agents.    One AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   119  available biological hazard duration tool available is an extract from the Biological Residual Hazard Tool located through the Air Force Emergency Management Community of Practice.  This  spreadsheet  addresses  Sporulated  Bacteria  (Anthrax  for  instance),  Non-Sporulated Bacteria (Plague for example), Viruses, and Toxins.  The spreadsheet has entries for different weapon  systems  and  provides  protective  posture,  personnel  exposure  control,  and  hazard duration recommendations for both indoors and outdoors situations. 4.5.3.  The  type(s)  of  radioisotope(s)  involved  is  the  primary  factor  to  consider  when calculating  hazard  duration  times  for  radiological  materials.    In  the  case  of  a  radiological dispersal  device  (RDD)  or  radiological  exposure  device  (RED),  generally  only  one  or  two types  of  radiological  material  are  anticipated  to  be  involved.    In  the  case  of  an  improvised nuclear  device  (IND)  or tactical/strategic  nuclear  weapons,  hundreds  of  different radioisotopes are involved. 4.5.3.1.  The radioactive half-life of specific radioisotopes can be determined from a wide variety of sources, to  include the handbooks provided by the Defense  Threat  Reduction Agency as part of their radiological courses at Kirtland AFB, NM.  Table 4.12, outlines the  half  life  information  for  the  radioisotopes  most  likely  to  be  used  in  RDD/RED packages.    Without  human  intervention  (removal  of  the  contaminated  surface  for instance)  a  time  period  equal  to  eight  to  ten  half-lives  is  generally  required  before  a radioisotope will decay to an acceptable level. Table 4.12.  Half-Life Information for Selected Radioisotopes HALF LIFE INFORMATION FOR RADIOISOTOPES LIKELY TO BE USED IN RDD/RED PACKAGES RADIOISOTOPE Iridium-192 Cobalt-60 Strontium-90 Cesium-137  Plutonium-238 HALF-LIFE 74 days 5.3 years 28.8 years 30.1 years 88 years 4.5.3.2.  When  nuclear  detonations  (fission/fusion)  occur,  hundreds  of types  of radioisotopes  are  involved  in  the  process.    Many  of  these  have  half-life  periods  of seconds, minutes, or hours.  As a result, the hazard duration timelines in the aftermath of a  nuclear  detonation  are  less  than  for  an  area  that  was  contaminated  with  only  one radioisotope  (Cobalt-60  for  instance).    The  ―7-10  rule‖  is  the  rule  of  thumb  for determining hazard duration timelines within the fallout area in the aftermath of a nuclear detonation.  See AFTTP 3-2.56, for details regarding this technique. 4.5.3.3.  The probability and extent of re-suspension of the radioactive particles after an attack  are  another  aspect  of  hazard  duration  that  must  be  considered.    While  alpha radiation particles do not pose a militarily significant hazard while outside the body, they can  have  serious  effects  on  internal  organs  and  tissues  once  inhaled  or  ingested  in sufficient  quantities.    Re-suspension  associated  with  RDDs  typically  does  not  represent an  operational  threat  to  personnel.    The  worst-case  results,  based  on  nuclear  fallout  re-suspension  caused  by  vehicles,  show  that  the  expected  one-hour  exposure  obtained  50 meters  (m)  downwind  from  the  highest  deposition  level  of  re-suspendable  deposition  is   120  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 well  below  the  general  public  annual  exposure  limit  of  0.1  REM.  Jet  wash  (backwash caused by a jet engine) data gathered from earlier studies and applied to RW depositions suggest  re-aerosolization rates one million  times lower than the ones used above, so jet wash  does  not  appear  to  be  an  operationally  relevant  factor.    However,  it  is  prudent  to monitor for re-suspension hazards in order to maximize personnel safety. 4.6.  Mission  Continuation.  Split  MOPP  operations  facilitate  mission  continuation  despite  the presence  of  CBRN  contamination  on  the  installation.    However,  supervisors  and  UCCs  should make every  effort to  control the movement  of personnel  from contaminated to  uncontaminated CBRN zones and vice versa (see  Chapter  2 Split MOPP).  Determine if a task can be delayed until the projected hazard duration time has passed; thereby allowing accomplishment of the task in a lesser MOPP.  The associated contamination avoidance objective is to expose the minimum amount of people to the minimum amount of hazard. 4.6.1.  When  movement  is  required,  supervisors  and  UCCs  must  identify  conditions  and procedures  to  regulate  movement  of  contaminated  personnel  and  equipment  between  clean and contaminated areas. 4.6.2.  Implement procedures for receiving and handling contaminated equipment moved into clean areas.  Examples include movement of contaminated munitions and POL vehicles into uncontaminated  zones  or  sectors  and  the  movement  of  uncontaminated  material  and transportation of people across contaminated zones or sectors.   Contamination  marking and clear  communication  of  the  zone  MOPP  levels  are  critical  to  successful  mission  execution and effective contamination avoidance. 4.7.  Medical  Protection  and  Casualty  Management.  Medical  protection  refers  to  those protective  measures  to  promote  fit  and  healthy  force,  obtain  proper  immunizations,  use  of prophylaxis,  and  barriers  to  prevent  or  counter  exposure  (i.e.,  RSDL)  during  a  CBRN  event.  Casualty  management  involves  self-aid  and  buddy  care,  patient  identification,  stabilization, medical  treatment,  rehabilitation,  and  transportation  of  victims  of  attacks,  is  necessary,  to  a higher level of care. 4.7.1.  Medical  Protection.    Some  vaccines  exist  as  a  preventive  measure  for  biological exposure.    These  vaccines  significantly  reduce  the  likelihood  of  disease.    There  are  also antibiotics available for use after a potential exposure to biological agents that can reduce or eliminate the agent  effects.  Commanders and supervisors must enforce proper hygiene and sanitation methods at all times.  The most basic of these measures is hand washing with soap and  water  before  eating  and  after  using  the  latrine.    Other  measures  include  protecting  and properly  storing  food;  cleaning  food  preparation  equipment  and  eating  utensils  after  use; eating  protected  foods  and  drinking  sufficient  amounts  of  protected  or  treated  water;  using approved methods for collection, storage and disposal of sewage and other wastes; avoiding direct contact with blood, body fluids, and feces; using insect repellents, and wearing shoes or boots and clothing that protects arms and legs. 4.7.2.  Casualty  Management.    IAW  AFTTP  3-42.2.,  a  casualty  is  defined  as  a  person  or persons unavailable for duty due to illness or injury.  It further defines casualty types, which are  classified  as  disease/non-battle  injuries  (DNBI)  and  battlefield  injuries/illness  (BI).    In cases within an irregular operational  environment with a CBRNE threat,  our direct  BI rates may increase significantly and may overwhelm medical treatment facilities and dramatically reduce combat effectiveness.  In addition to physiological ailments, victims of an attack may AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   121  suffer  from  psychological  disorders  including  acute  stress,  panic,  and  post-traumatic  stress syndrome, the effects of which may not be apparent for weeks, months, or even years after an attack.  Symptoms of psychological disorders range from anxiety due to fear of exposure, to long-term  stress  that  deteriorates  physical  and  mental  health.    The  actual  physical  damage individuals could suffer in an attack can vary significantly.  All CBRN events may achieve a psychological  impact  that  exceeds  the  physical  damage  caused,  especially  when  the  events occur without warning. 4.7.2.1.  Challenges.  Unique challenges can arise for proper casualty management when CBRN materials are involved.  All aspects of care, from SABC to transportation, become more complicated. 4.7.2.1.1.  SABC involving CBRN.  SABC involving CBRN materials in a traditional OE has been widely trained, specifically with the use of the nerve antidote treatment and personal decontamination kits.  SABC involving CBRN during irregular warfare situations  can  be  more  complicated  and  does  not  have  standardized  post  exposure treatment that can be administered by the general military populace.  In cases where CBRN exposure is suspected, it is critical that particular attention is given to the signs and symptoms being presented by the patient, and this information is passed along to medical personnel to assist in treatment. 4.7.2.1.2.  Patient  Identification.   Patient  identification  procedures  have  been standardized and trained during SABC courses;  however, casualties created because of CBRN exposure  may  need to  be further identified as contaminated.    If possible, the patient identification information should include the suspected contaminant.  This will assist in patient treatment as well as the protection of health care providers. 4.7.2.1.3.  Medical Treatment.  Casualties caused by exposure to CBRN can place an excessive burden on pharmacy stockpiles.  Medical  treatment  facilities (MTFs) may have  to  draw  upon  Military  Vaccine  Agency,  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and Prevention  (CDC)  and/or  strategic  national  stockpiles  to  meet  the  needs  of  patients.  The Laboratory Response Network (LRN) burden may increase due to use of CBRN.  Today, the LRN is charged with the task of maintaining an integrated network of state and  local  public  health,  federal,  military,  and  international  laboratories  that  can respond  to  bioterrorism  and  chemical  terrorism  as  well  as  other  public  health emergencies. 4.7.2.1.4.  Transportation  of  contaminated,  contagious  or  potentially  exposed casualties.    Transportation  of  contaminated,  contagious  or  potentially  exposed casualties  resulting  from  a  CBRN  incident  poses  unique  challenges  to  the aeromedical patient movement system.  Decontamination must be completed prior to transportation.    In  rare  cases,  prior  to  the  completion  of  full  decontamination operations  transportation  may  be  essential  to  preserve  life  or  continue  critical missions.    In  such  cases,  all  efforts  must  be  made  to  prevent  the  spread  of contamination,  and  prior  approval  must  be  obtained  from  the  geographic  combatant commander,  USTRANSCOM,  and  the  SecDef  in  consultation  with  DOD  medical authorities.  Casualties with  known or suspected highly contagious  diseases will not be transported within the system.   These include infections with  any  agent  that may pose  a  potential  threat  to  national  security,  require  special  public  health  actions,  or   122  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 have  the  potential  to  cause  public  panic  and  social  disruption.    Patients  known  or suspected to be infected with a highly contagious disease should be treated in place or with  minimal  transportation  to  medical  authorities.    In  extreme  circumstances,  there may  be  a  requirement  to  move  index  cases  (approximately  two)  for  evaluation  or critical medical care.  In such cases, prior approval for movement must be obtained in the same manner as applies to contaminated casualties. 4.8.  Restoration  of  Infrastructure.  CBRNE attacks or incidents  may  generate a wide variety of  effects  that  greatly  complicate  planning  and  preparations  to  restore  infrastructure.    Nuclear events  create  a significant  degree of physical  damage and radiation.   Chemical,  biological,  and radiological incidents may result in short- or long-term residual contamination hazards, but may create  little  or  no  physical  damage.    Conventional  high  yield  explosives  may  cause  extensive physical  damage.    All  CBRNE  events  will  likely  challenge  existing  capabilities  to  continue  or restore operations.  Actions must be taken to maintain or restore essential services and manage and mitigate problems resulting from CBRNE attacks.  Limit infrastructure restorations to those necessary to permit mission accomplishment.  CE will restore critical infrastructure based on the installation  commander‘s  priorities  and  in  accordance  with  applicable  information  assurance contingency plan and continuity of operations processes.    An attack in an irregular operational environment  may  be  isolated  to  an  individual  facility  or  multiple  locations  depending  on  the complexity and type of attack.  The effects of the attack may be similar to that of a nation-state, but evidence preservation considerations may delay restoration of infrastructure. 4.8.1.  DELETED 4.8.2.  DELETED 4.9.  Mitigation.  Mitigation is defined as any sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate long-term  risk  to  human  life  and  property  from  an  event.    The  goal  of  mitigation  is  to  decrease  the need for response, as opposed to simply increasing the response capability.  Mitigation can save lives  and  reduce  property  damage.    Mitigation  strategies  include:  education  and  awareness initiatives,  development  and  update  of  CBRNE  response  plans  (DCP,  MCRP,  and  CEMP  10-2 for instance), rapid inventory assessment protocol for critical resources (e.g., staffing, beds, large pre-designated waiting areas) and supplies (e.g., antibiotics, X-ray film, laboratory supplies, anti-virals and anti-toxins).  Protection is also a major element of mitigation.  Protection provides the force  with  survival  and  sustainment  measures  to  operate  in  a  CBRN  environment  when contamination cannot be avoided.  Identifying, assessing, and mitigating residual hazards in the theater of operations are another important aspect of conflict termination.  US and multinational forces  must  be  able  to  detect  and  evaluate  hazardous  areas  in  order  to  contain  and  mitigate contamination hazards. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   123  Chapter 5 INFORMATION COLLECTION, RECORDS, AND FORMS 5.1.

This  is derived from  the ability of each unit to deliver the outputs for which it was designed.  (b) joint readiness - The combatant commander‘s ability to integrate and synchronize ready combat and support forces to execute his or her assigned missions. Reconstitution— Decontamination that involves:  (1) Aim - eliminate contamination to restore mission critical resources to a condition which permits unrestricted use, handling, or operation,   160  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 and  release  from  military  control.    (Decontaminate  to  the  national  standards  of  the  location  to which the resources will be sent.  If no national standards are available, use US standards.) (2) When— conducted after hostile actions have terminated, when the commander determines it is in the unit's best interest, or when directed by higher authority.  (3) Who - units or installation s with external support.  (4) What - mission critical aircraft, equipment, material, work areas and terrain.

Personnel  Protection.  Personnel protection, within the context of this Manual, includes the  procedures  and  equipment  designed  to  protect  the  health  and  safety  of  members  before, during,  and  after  a  CBRNE  event.    This  includes  those  procedures  designed  to  keep  personnel out of a hazard area as well as medical measures and equipment/facilities that provide protection by design. A2.2.  Individual  Protective  Equipment  (IPE).  During  contingency  operations,  personnel protection  is  achieved  using  IPE  and  protection  levels  known  as  MOPP.    MOPP  is  used  to support  military  unique  conditions.    The  IPE  and  MOPP  levels  are  designed  to  allow commanders to increase or decrease the level of protection rapidly.  The commander determines the initial MOPP level, based on MOPP analysis, and adjusts MOPP level as CBRNE risks and mission priorities change.  Individual protective actions are taken by personnel in response to an alarm  condition  change,  discovery  of  unexploded  ordnance  (UXO),  CBRN  contamination,  or direct attack.  A complete IPE listing can be found in AFI 10-2501. A2.2.1.  Proper selection and wearing of approved IPE will provide the required respiratory protection  and  contact  protection  while  in  a  conventional  CBRN  environment.    This  is achieved  via  air  filtration  devices,  by  atmosphere  supplying  respiratory  equipment,  such  as the M7 Firehawk Responder, Self -Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), T.O. 14S5-36-1 Operation  Instrustion—Self  Contained  Breathing  Apparatus,  Manual,  Operation  and  User Maintenance Instructions, Self Contained Breathing Apparatus, Firehawk M7 Responder Air Mask.        Skin  protection  is  achieved  through  the  chemical  protective  overgarment  (CPO) otherwise known as Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST).  While IPE respiratory protection is not normally used to respond to a CBRN incident during non-contingency  postures,  it  can  be  used  by  personnel  as  an  escape  mask  to  evacuate  from  a hazard zone.  For example, Security Forces members during the course of their daily military duties may find themselves unexpectedly in a hazard zone and can use the protective mask to evacuate to a safe location.  It will not be used to re-enter or respond into a hazard zone that has not been characterized. A2.2.1.1.  Air-Filtration  Masks.    The  military  protective  mask  (MCU2/P  series,  M45 and/or M50) provides a diverse range of CBRN airborne hazard protection to the wearer and  is  immediately  available  for  employment  in  authorized  circumstances  (e.g. conventional  warfare  environments,  military  unique  operations  during  irregular  warfare activities).  As such, it can be used by all military and government employees requiring CBRN  protection  in  lieu  of  local  health  and  operational  risk  assessments  deeming  this mask inappropriate.  The military protective mask has limitations.  These limitations must be considered when planning and executing missions.  For example, air-filtration masks do not provide oxygen, so using them in oxygen deficient environments is dangerous and impractical. A2.2.1.2.  Atmosphere-Supplying  Respiratory  Equipment.   Atmosphere-supplying respiratory equipment, such as the SCBA and the supplied-air respirators (SAR), provide the wearer with  a source of air that creates a positive pressure in  the face-piece.  These respirators permit the wearer to operate in low-oxygen and volatile chemical atmospheres   166  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 where  an  air-purifying  respirator  does  not  offer  enough  protection.    The  SCBA  is  most commonly used in emergency operations and the SAR is used when extended work times are required.  These devices will provide the wearer with the greatest protection against the widest range of potential exposures to gases and vapors. A2.2.1.3.  Chemical  Protective  Overgarment.    Protection  of  skin  contact  is  normally provided  with  the  Joint  Service  Lightweight  Integrated  Suit  Technology  (JSLIST) ensemble, consisting of gloves, pants, jacket, and boots.  Thus equipped, the JSLIST will create a protective barrier between the wearer and the hazard. A2.2.2.  IPE Analysis and Management.  The projected threat environment at an airbase will not always require extended full MOPP 4 conditions.  In some threat environments, presence of  radioactive  fallout  for  instance;  MOPP  4  is  never  the  required  or  desired  protective posture.  During the preparation phase, EM personnel can use threat intelligence and current weather  conditions  to  formulate  protection  requirements  and  predict  hazard  duration.  Medical  personnel  can  provide  recommendations  to  ensure  safe  and  sustained  operations under various climatic conditions.  The commander and staff should use this information to develop standard responses and follow-on courses of action for each primary airbase mission.  After an attack, EM personnel will use the information collected from PAR teams to identify the  type  of  agents  used,  the  likely  duration  of  exposure,  and  minimum  protection requirements.    The  commander  and  staff  can  then  determine  what  courses  of  action  to employ.    EM  and  BE  technicians  can  further  assist  the  commander  to  determine  risk  and assist units as they develop threat-based courses of action. A2.2.2.1.  Most,  if  not  all,  installation  missions  can  be  conducted  in  contaminated environments  if  the  base  populace  is  well  trained  and  leadership  understands  the  threat environment.    Through  a  combination  of  training  and  leadership,  all  mission  essential tasks  can  be  completed  while  wearing  IPE  or  using  approved  MOPP  options.    Most senior leaders know they cannot expect the same work rates in MOPP 4 as those achieved in  MOPP  0.    They  must  evaluate  their  ability  to  meet  mission  requirements  and communicate  changes  to  their  forces.    Depending  on  the  task  and  climate,  the consequences to personnel may range from insignificant to catastrophic. A2.2.2.2.  Depending  on  the  tactical  situation,  commanders  choose  the  appropriate  IPE level. A2.2.2.3.  Commander‘s Guidance.  Commanders should use IPE flexibly to protect their units  in  a  potential  or  actual  CBRNE  situation.    While  the  various  headquarters  may provide  initial  directives  on  IPE  level,  subordinate  units  adapt  this  guidance  to  local conditions when warranted.  Units can increase the IPE level set by higher headquarters in response to direct threats. A2.2.2.4.  IPE  Analysis  Procedures.    Commanders  must  perform  situation-based  IPE analysis to determine the appropriate IPE level.  This analysis enhances the probability of mission  success  by  balancing  the  reduced  risk  of  casualties  due  to  exposure  to  CBRN materials against the increased risk of performance decrements and heat strain casualties as IPE levels.  Commanders must consider three factors for their IPE analysis: mission, environment, and airman factors when performing IPE analysis. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   167  A2.2.2.5.  The  type  of  mission  will  influence  the  amount  of  protection  needed  by  each airman.    How  important  is  the  mission,  and  what  risks  will  it  require?    The  answers  to several of the mission-related questions will be provided in the intelligence preparation of the battlespace (IPB) process.  When the threat of CBRNE agent employment is high, and expected  warning  time  for  the  unit  is  short,  a  high  level  of  IPE  is  dictated  to  provide adequate  protection.   However,  increased  IPE  levels  will  lead  to  performance degradation.    Additionally,  the  incidence  of  heat  casualties  among  airmen  performing physically  demanding  work  becomes  greater  with  increasing  IPE  levels.    The  more critical the mission, the more thorough commanders must be in their analysis; the impact of decreased performance and heat casualties from IPE must be weighed carefully against the risk of casualties and potential mission failure due to CBRN agent exposures. A2.2.2.5.1.  IPE  analysts  must  consider  the  work  intensity  the  mission  will  require and how long this work-load must be maintained.  Is time a critical factor in mission success? What  will be required of the airmen after achieving the mission objective?  Can they rest?  Must they dig-in and defend in place? A2.2.2.5.2.  The ambient environmental conditions must be known before beginning an assessment of how these conditions will affect the airmen's ability to successfully complete a mission.  Ensure you have accurate local weather information.  Check the weather daily; variations in temperature, wind, and humidity can be substantial from region  to  region.    Know  what  your  weather  will  be.    Primary  environmental  factor considerations are listed below in Table A2.1 Table A2.1.  Environmental Factor Considerations What is the ambient air temperature? What is the humidity? What is the WBGT index reading for the unit's AO? Is it cloudy, sunny or windy? Is it day or night? A2.2.2.5.3.  Most  AF  guidance  for  prevention  of  heat  injury  and  illness  is  based  on wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) readings.  The WBGT reading provides a single measure  of  the  major  determinants  of  environmental  heat  stress  (for  example,  air temperature, wind speed, solar load, and humidity).  Although the WBGT provides an adequate representation of the heat stress under most conditions, it is not perfect and should be interpreted as approximate guidance.  For instance, it was not optimized for conditions commonly seen in environmental extremes, such as the desert.  Guidance based  on  the  WBGT  is  appropriate  only  for  airmen  who  are  fully  acclimatized, optimally conditioned, hydrated, and rested.  Additionally, WBGT guidelines do not accurately  forecast  injury/illness  rates  under  conditions  of  lower  temperatures  and high  humidity  such  as  may  be  experienced  in  the  early  morning  hours;  humidity levels  over  75  percent  substantially  increase  the  risk  of  heat  injury  under  all  work conditions.  Another critical item of weather information for the IPB and IPE analysis is  wind  speed.    When  the  air  temperature  is  below  skin  temperature  (approximately 92°F), high winds aid in the dissipation of body heat.   168  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 A2.2.2.6.  Airman  Factors.    The  maintenance  of  full  hydration  is  the  most  important factor influencing the work performance of airmen wearing  IPE in  warm environments.  Dehydration  negates  the  advantages  of  heat  acclimation  and  high  physical  fitness.  Dehydration  impairs  the  ability  to  regulate  body  temperature,  reduces  mental  and physical work performance, and increases susceptibility to heat injuries/illnesses.  These adverse effects become increasingly dangerous as the level of dehydration becomes more severe.  Even as little as a two percent loss of body weight due  to dehydration degrades performance.  Factors to consider are in Table A2.2, below. Table A2.2.  Airman Factor Considerations Are the airmen well hydrated and nourished?  Are the airmen well rested?  Are the airmen heat acclimatized?  Are the airmen physically fit and well trained?  Are the airmen healthy? A2.2.2.6.1.  Leadership  can  minimize  dehydration  by  establishing  guidance  of enforced drinking.  Leaders can reduce the likelihood of inadequate drinking in IPE, especially when masked, by taking advantage of flexible masking policies (IPE 1-25 percent masked), often rotating masked and unmasked airmen. A2.2.2.6.2.  The  work/rest  and  maximum  continuous  work  time  values  in  Table A2.6, assumes that all airmen are fully hydrated, heat acclimatized, physically fit, and fully rested.  In those cases when the commander is aware that the assumptions of the guidance  do  not  hold,  the  estimates  in  the  tables  must  be  adjusted  upwards  or downwards  depending  on  the  situation.    Dehydration  has  the  greatest  impact  on performance,  but  failure  to  meet  the  other  factors  will  also  impact  upon  thermo-regulation  and  performance.    For  instance,  going  without  sleep  for  more  than  30 hours  can  impair  one's  ability  to  regulate  body  temperature  and  can  reduce  task performance. A2.2.2.6.3.  Performance  degradation  factors  (1.5  for  physical  work  and  2.5  for mental work) may require upward adjustment.  Additionally a downward adjustment may be necessary in the cases of experienced personnel.  Example: if a task normally takes  90  minutes  to  complete,  take  the  performance  degradation  factor  for  physical work, then multiply the performance degradation factor by the normal time (1.5 x 90).  The full IPE time to completion is 135 minutes.  If conducting the mission in full IPE will take longer than the commander's guidance permits, adjustments will be required to  meet  the  mission  guidance.    The  possible  adjustments  include:  staggering scheduled  personnel  on  the  task;  augmenting  the  unit  with  additional  manpower; adopting  a  MOPP  variation  such  as  the  ventilation  option  if  the  CBRN  contact  and percutaneous vapor penetration hazards are low. A2.2.3.  Missile  Warning.    Missile  warning  systems  are  different  within  each  theater  of operations.    In  most  cases  the  airbase  will  have  a  common  operating  picture  that  provides instantaneous  warning  from  the  theater  air  and  missile  defense  system  but  may  receive missile launch warning from the Theater Air Control Center or other command and control node.  Warning systems are often a mix of computer systems, radio, telephone, or pager alert AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   169  systems.    Actual  warning  timelines  are  a  combination  of  events  that  begin  with  the  missile launch detection, and end with the impact on or near the airbase.  Quick actions are required by  each  link  in  the  warning  chain  to  maximize  pre-attack  actions  at  the  targeted  airbase.  Delays  in  warning  or  slow  response  by  key  staff  may  limit  or  eliminate  the  ability  to accomplish mitigating actions.  Planning for these scenarios and quick decisions by the staff may  allow  the  airbase  to  launch  sorties  or  complete  other  critical  missions  that  would otherwise be delayed or lost. A2.2.3.1.  Installation  staffs  must  analyze  their  warning  system  and  develop  likely timelines  for  each  warning  event  from  missile  launch  to  impact.    An  analysis  would include  the  actual  or  expected  time  for  each  event  in  the  warning  chain.    These  events may  show  that  a  window  of  opportunity  exists  for  the  commander  to  direct  last  minute actions to continue missions or protect vulnerable resources. A2.2.3.2.  Installation  Response  to  Missile  Flyovers.   TBM  flyovers  are  nearly indistinguishable  from  direct  attack  during  the  missile  flight.    Only  after  the  TBM  has passed or impacted at another location will anyone know if it was only a flyover.  TBMs may include chemical or biological agents; therefore, conduct accurate and timely threat assessments  to  determine  the  appropriate  alarm  condition,  IPE  level,  and  ―last  second‖ contamination avoidance actions.  Since there are several targets within any given theater that an enemy would like to destroy or disrupt, it is probable that each TBM attack will not include strikes at every desirable target.  While the CAT may be routinely warned of missile  launches,  it  is  likely  that  not  every  attack  is  targeted  at  the  installation.  Consequently,  it  is  imperative  the  installation  be  able  to  rapidly  respond  to  all  missile warnings, but be prepared and able to return rapidly to normal operations within moments after  determining  that  it  was  a  flyover  versus  an  attack  at  the  site.    This  aspect  of conventional  warfare  activities  must  be  exercised  routinely  because  critical  mission operations will be degraded if needless activities are accomplished and excessive time is lost following each missile launch that was not targeted at the installation. A2.2.4.  Aircraft  Attack  Warning.    The  aircraft  attack  warning  process  is  similar  to  the missile warning process, with the exception that warning times may permit the commander to implement planned, Alarm Yellow actions.  Table A2.3, shows how in the absence of an air defense  common  operating  picture  the  staff  identifies  aircraft  attack  warning  timelines  for three likely airbase attack ingress routes.  The sample analysis includes the expected time for each event in the warning chain.  These events show how long the airbase can take advantage of  Alarm  Yellow  actions  and  establish  an  approximate  time  for  declaration  of  Alarm  Red.  Alarm  Yellow  actions  should  be  planned  and  time-phased  to  achieve  the  highest  defensive posture possible shortly before Alarm Red is declared. A2.2.5.  Task  performance  in  CBRN  IPE.    Increasing  threats  of  CBRN  weapons  make  it critical to understand how task performance may suffer in a contaminated environment.  For example,  wearing  protective  gloves  reduces  manual  dexterity,  thus  increasing  task performance  time  and  impairing  the  precision  of  movement.    Wearing  of  a  chemical protective respirator can restrict the field  of view, and thus  may interfere with  the wearer‘s ability to see the objects they are manipulating.   170  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 A2.2.6.  Heat Stress Considerations while Wearing the IPE.  The protective suit often causes heat  stress  and  subjective  discomfort  during  continuous  operation  in  hot  and  humid conditions. Table A2.3.

Dehydration.    Although  strict  adherence  to  work/rest  criteria  is  possible  during training  exercises,  this  may  not  be  possible  during  combat  operations.    For  example,  the maximum  number  of  minutes  of  work  before  the  risk  of  becoming  a  casualty  exceeds  five percent.    These  estimates,  representing  average  expected  values  within  a  large  population, should be considered approximate guidance and not be used as a substitute for common sense or experience.   Individuals  will vary in  their tolerance.  Once the  work time limit  has been reached, airmen should rest in the shade before returning to work. A2.2.7.1.  In  minimizing  heat  stress,  work/rest  schedules  may  be  supplemented  by microclimate cooling systems in which an air- or liquid- cooled vest worn under the CPO removes  body  heat  away  from  skin.    Microclimate  cooling  systems  are  available  inside certain  combat  vehicles,  but  microclimate  cooling  options  are  not  usually  available  for dismounted airmen. A2.2.7.2.  Even  when  work/rest  schedules  and  microclimate  cooling  are  used,  an increased risk of performance degradation and heat casualties is inevitable when wearing IPE in hot weather. A2.2.7.3.  Because  of  higher  body  temperatures,  airmen  in  IPE  gear  sweat  considerably more  than  usual,  often  more  than  1.5  quarts  of  water  every  hour  during  work.    Water must be consumed to replace lost fluids or dehydration will follow.  Even a slight degree of  dehydration  impairs  the  body's  ability  to  regulate  its  temperature  and  nullifies  the benefits  of  heat  acclimatization  and  physical  fitness,  increases  the  susceptibility  to  heat injury,  and  reduces  work  capacity  (including  G-tolerance  in  pilots),  appetite,  and alertness.    Even  in  airmen  who  are  not  heat  casualties,  the  combined  effects  of dehydration, restricted heat loss from the body, and increased work effort place a severe strain on the body's functions, and airmen suffer from decrements in mental and physical performance. A2.2.7.3.1.  The difficulty of drinking in IPE increases the likelihood of dehydration.  Thirst  is  not  an  adequate  indicator  of  dehydration;  airmen  will  not  sense  when  they are dehydrated and will fail to replace body water losses, even when drinking water is AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   171  readily  available.    Leadership  must  take  responsibility  for  enforcing  regular  and timely fluid replacement in their personnel. A2.2.7.3.2.  Base  the  recommended  hourly  replenishment  shown  in  Table  A2.4,  on current work intensity, temperature, clothing layers, and light cycle.  For example, at moderate  work  intensity  in  full  IPE  (over  underwear  only)  and  daylight  WBGT  of 80°F, personnel  should drink  approximately 2.0  quarts of water per hour if working continuously, or 1.0 quart per hour if working according to the work/rest schedule. A2.2.7.3.3.  Airmen should drink as much as possible before donning the mask, and frequent  drinking  while  working  is  more  effective  in  maintaining  hydration  than waiting until rest periods to drink.  The estimates in Table A2.4, will also provide the logistics  officer  with  information  that  can  be  used  to  calculate  potential  drinking water  requirements  and  allocate  assets  needed  to  get  the  water  to  the  personnel.  Additional water should be made available for such things as hygiene, cooking, and medical requirements. Table A2.4.

If wearing MOPP 4, add 10ºF to WBGT.  If wearing personal body armor in humid climates, add 15ºF to WBGT. 2.  Rest means minimal physical activity (sitting or standing), accomplished in shade if possible. 3.  Caution: Daily fluid intake should not exceed 12 quarts.  Hourly fluid intake should not exceed 1 quart.  The work/rest time and fluid replacement volumes will sustain performance and hydration for at least 4 hours of work in the specified work category.  Individual water needs will vary ±¼ quart/hour. 4.  NL=no limit to work time per hour. 5.  For continuous work in temperatures above 80ºF, personnel will consume 2 quarts of water. A2.2.8.  Inadequate Nutrition.  In addition to bodily requirements for electrolyte replacement caused  by  sweating,  the  higher  work  intensities  typical  of  operations  in  IPE  lead  to  an increased demand for calories.  Lack of adequate energy supplies can lead to decrements in both  physical  and  mental  performance.    The  AF  has  tailored  its  field  feeding  menus  to provide adequate amounts of both salts and calories to support IPE operations.   172  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 A2.2.8.1.  The  method  selected  to  minimize  feeding-related  problems  depends  on availability of safe, uncontaminated areas, as well as other operational  constraints.  In a contaminated  area  where  there  is  also  a  vapor  hazard,  move  airmen  into  a  collective-protection facility to eat meals.  Since collective protection shelters have limited capacity, rotate  small  groups  through  these  facilities.    In  a  contaminated  area  with  no  collective protection available, relocate airmen to a safe area for feeding by rotating small portions of the unit or by entire unit replacement.  If personnel are in a contaminated area with no detectable inhalation hazard or in a clean area where they are under a constant threat of CBRN  attack,  use  a  rotating  method  for  feeding  about  25  percent  at  any  one  time  and take care to prevent contaminating the food. A2.3.  Miosis.  Observe the eyes for contraction of the pupils, the first sign of exposure to nerve agent  vapor.    Although  IPE  gear  may  be  the  most  common  source  of  performance  problems during  CBRN  operations,  some  chemical  agents,  primarily  the  nerve  agents,  can  produce performance decrements at exposure levels below that which would cause casualties.  Very small amounts  of  nerve  agent,  such  as  vapor  or  aerosol  absorbed  through  the  eyes  will  constrict  the pupils.  This condition is called miosis.  It may or may not involve pain or headache.  The pupil is unable to dilate normally, thus reducing night  vision and the efficiency of using night vision devices.  Miosis can degrade depth perception as well as reduce the efficiency of performance of tasks  at  night:  for  example,  navigating  on  foot,  identifying  and  engaging  targets,  and  driving vehicles  under  blackout  conditions.    Miosis  can  also  interfere  with  a  pilot‘s  ability  to  change focus frequently while flying. A2.3.1.  Symptoms  of  miosis  range  from  minimal  to  severe,  depending  on  the  dosage.  Victims  may  experience  headaches  when  exposed  to  bright  light.    Severe  miosis  and  the consequent reduced ability to see in dim light may persist for 48 hours after onset.  The pupil gradually  returns  to  normal  over  several  days.    Full  recovery  may  take  20  days  or  longer.  Repeated exposures within this period cause cumulative effects. A2.4.  Psychological Factors. A2.4.1.  CBRN warfare threat adds to an already stressful situation because it creates unique fears in personnel and isolates them from their environment.  Full IPE reduces the ability to see and hear clearly and makes it more difficult to recognize and communicate with others.  This  creates or increases feelings of isolation and confusion.  The awkwardness  of wearing bulky overgarments, gloves, and boots on top of the Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) or Battle Dress  Uniform  (BDU)  causes  frustration  in  many  personnel  and  claustrophobia  in  some.  Long periods of reduced mobility and sensory awareness degrade attention and alertness and create  or  increase  feelings  of  alienation.    Chemical  filters  in  the  protective  mask  make breathing more difficult; this too may create feelings of claustrophobia or panic.  The enemy will  use  the  chemical  agent  threat  to  exploit  these  weaknesses  and  to  induce  protective postures that reduce combat effectiveness. A2.4.2.  The adverse impact of psychological stress during IPE operations can be minimized by  the  experience  and  confidence  that  realistic  training  in  full  IPE  provides.    Successful training helps support unit preparations for battle stress encountered during conflict or war. A2.5.  Combat  Stress.  The  threat  of  CBRN  warfare  increases  the  overall  psychological  and physiological stress that is an integral part of combat.  Because full IPE is only worn when the threat  of  imminent  attack  is  the  greatest,  encapsulation  increases  generalized  fears  and  anxiety AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   173  about combat.  Combat stress or battlefield fatigue can cause significant numbers of psychiatric casualties; estimates range from 10 percent to 30 percent depending on the duration and intensity of attack.  Psychological  stress  stems  not  only  from  the death  and destruction that characterize combat,  but  also  from  the  challenging  operational  conditions  --  noise,  confusion,  and  loss  of sleep.    Challenging  operational  conditions  create  fatigue  and  may  cause  changes  in  diet  and personal hygiene.  The result is a significant increase in physiological stress.  Realistic training, fitness, and effective leadership reduce the liabilities associated with combat stress. A2.5.1.  Leaders can sustain airmen performance at an optimal level by using frequent short rest  breaks  to  provide  relief  from  IPE,  combined  with  adequate  sleep,  food,  and  drink.  Combat stress studies indicate that six or more hours of uninterrupted sleep per twenty-four hour period is optimum; four hours is the minimum for a few days of sustained operations.  During  the  period  of  0100  to  0700  hours,  leaders  must  be  aware  that  the  body  experiences reduced mental concentration, confusion, nervousness, and lack of clear thinking.  Reversed cycle training is a proven method to reduce the impact of degraded performance during the early morning hours.  Leaders should plan activities to reduce boredom, fatigue, inattention, and discomfort; these are major contributors to ineffective performance. A2.5.2.  Two factors that increase unit effectiveness as a whole are for leaders to create and maintain  a  high  level  of  unit  cohesion  and  individual  identity.    Units  must  frequently  train together under demanding  conditions.    If personnel  know that they can overcome  adversity together,  unit  cohesion  will  be  high.    Leaders  must  take  a  visible  and  true  interest  in  the welfare  of  their  personnel  and  build  the  confidence  necessary  to  withstand  the  effects  of stress.  Leaders must keep personnel informed about the tactical situation so that the adverse effects of uncertainty are minimized.  Personnel who become ineffective because of combat stress should be given a period of rest as close to the front as possible and given reassurance and support by all members of their unit. A2.6.  Psychological  Symptoms.  Rarely  will  leaders  on  the  integrated  battlefield  be  able  to distinguish between the different types of stress.  For example, excessive sweating, nausea, and claustrophobia can be caused by fear and anxiety about combat, by dehydration and heat illness, by total encapsulation in full IPE, or even by exposure to a chemical agent.  Symptoms of stress with a psychological origin could include any of the following shown in Table A2.5 Table A2.5.  Psychological Stress Symptoms Mood Thinking Unusual impatience, frustration, or irritability. Unusual fatigue or sleepiness. Loneliness, isolation, or alienation. Feelings of helplessness.  Claustrophobia. Forgetfulness or absentmindedness (especially common are errors in map plotting and message coding). Impaired decision making, reasoning, or judgment. Disorientation, confusion, or panic. Hallucinations or paranoia. Physical Signs Rapid breathing (hyperventilation) or rapid heart rate (tachycardia). "Cotton mouth" or nausea. Cramps or muscle tension.  A2.7.  Authority  to  Declare  IPE  Levels.  The installation  commander  or  designated representative  determines  the  IPE  levels  for  the  airbase.    The  installation  commander  or   174  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 designated representative is the authority for IPE level reductions.  Subordinate commanders can be delegated the authority to reduce IPE levels or employ IPE options.  Commanders delegated this  authority  must  be  provided  with  the  specific  conditions  under  which  an  IPE  reduction  or option is authorized. A2.7.1.  IPE Levels.  All AF personnel located in or deployable to CBRNE medium and high threat areas are trained to use standard IPE levels.  Table A2.6, shows the estimated time for a  trained  airman  to  don  the  IPE  for  each  IPE  level.    After  personnel  don  IPE,  they  will perform  a  buddy  check  on  personnel  within  the  immediate  area.    Use  the  buddy  check method  to  verify  proper  IPE  wear  and  to  provide  IPE  and  specialized  equipment  donning assistance. Table A2.6.

See AFVA 10-2512, Mission Oriented Protective Postures (MOPP) for visual representation of all MOPP levels. A2.7.1.1.  MOPP  Levels.    Individual  protection  levels  are  referred  to  as  MOPP  and  are used  only  to  support  militarily-unique  conditions.    These  levels  are  designed  to  allow commanders  to  increase  or  decrease  the  level  of  protection  rapidly  without  providing long explanations.  The commander determines the initial MOPP level, based on MOPP analysis,  and  adjusts  MOPP  levels  as  CBRNE  risks  and  mission  priorities  change.  Individual  protective  actions  are  taken  by  personnel  in  response  to  an  alarm  condition change,  discovery  of  unexploded  ordnance  (UXO)  or  CBRN  contamination,  or  direct attack.  See AFVA 10-2512, for visual representation of all MOPP levels. A2.7.1.2.  MOPP  READY.    All  IPE  will  be  stored  and  available  for  use  within  the prescribed time determined by the installation commander.  This should be determined on average  time  it  would  take  someone  to  get  to  their  IPE  and  the  local  threat.    Personnel will  inspect  issued  IPE  and  prepare  it  for  use.    Stored  IPE  and  field  gear  components should be located within each person‘s assigned shelter, duty section, or other designated area.  When directed, wear field gear and personal body armor.  Use MOPP READY as the  normal  wartime  IPE  level  when  the  enemy  has  a  CBRN  capability  but  there  is  no indication of CBRN use in the immediate future. A2.7.1.3.  MOPP 0.  Personnel inspect issued IPE and prepare it for use.  Keep the field gear and one CPO available for immediate donning.  Store the components of the second or subsequent CPO sets in each person‘s assigned shelter, duty section, or other area until arrangements are made to collect the ensembles for use at the CCAs.  Do not remove the operational  CPO  from  the  vapor  bag  or  install  operational  C2  series  canisters  on  the AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   175  protective mask until directed.  Install the second skin on the protective mask.  Wear the field gear and personal body armor when outdoors or when directed.  Inspect and attach M9 paper when directed to  remove the CPO from  the vapor bag.  Adjust the protective mask.  Remove contact lenses.  Adjust and wear the protective mask spectacles or place them  with  the  IPE  that  is  available  for  immediate  donning.    Keep  M8  and  M9  paper, nerve  agent  antidotes,  and  decontamination  kits  with  the  IPE  that  is  available  for immediate donning.  Use MOPP 0 as the normal wartime IPE level when the enemy has a CBRN capability. A2.7.1.4.  MOPP  1.    Wear  the  CPO.    Carry  the  protective  mask,  footwear  covers,  and gloves.    Close  all  zippers,  snaps,  and  Velcro®  fasteners.    Wear  field  gear  and  personal body  armor  when  outdoors  or  when  directed.    Attach  M9  paper  to  the  CPO.    Carry  or keep  at  hand  M8  and  M9  paper,  nerve  agent  antidotes,  and  decontamination  kits.  Remove contact lenses.  Wear protective mask spectacles.  Implement forced hydration, work/rest cycles, and buddy checks.  Use MOPP 1 when attacks could occur with little or no warning. A2.7.1.5.  MOPP  2.    Wear  the  CPO  and  overboots.    Carry  the  protective  mask  and gloves.    Close  all  zippers,  snaps,  and  Velcro®  fasteners.    Wear  field  gear  and  personal body  armor  when  outdoors  or  when  directed.    Attach  M9  paper  to  the  CPO.    Carry  or keep  at  hand  M8  and  M9  paper,  nerve  agent  antidotes,  and  decontamination  kits.  Remove contact lenses.  Wear protective mask spectacles.  Implement forced hydration, work/rest cycles, and buddy checks.  Use MOPP 2 when attacks could occur with little or no warning.  Individuals assume MOPP 2 when Alarm Yellow is declared in an area with a chemical-biological threat.  Use MOPP 2 to provide additional protection to personnel when crossing or operating in previously contaminated areas. A2.7.1.6.  MOPP 3.  Wear the CPO, overboots, and protective mask.  Carry the  gloves.  Close  all  zippers,  snaps,  and  Velcro®  fasteners.    Wear  field  gear  and  personal  body armor when outdoors or when directed.  Carry or keep at hand M8 and M9 paper, nerve agent  antidotes,  and  decontamination  kits.    Remove  contact  lenses.    Wear  protective mask  spectacles.    Enforce  hydration  standards,  work/rest  cycles,  and  buddy  checks.  MOPP  3  is  a  post-attack  protective  posture  that  has  very  limited  application.    Use  it  at additional  risk  when  personnel  performing  essential  tasks  require  increased  dexterity.  Use MOPP 3 when a negligible contact or percutaneous vapor hazard is present. A2.7.1.7.  MOPP  4.    Wear  the  CPO,  overboots,  protective  mask,  and  gloves.    Close  all zippers,  snaps,  and  Velcro®  fasteners.    Wear  field  gear  and  personal  body  armor  when outdoors  or  when  directed.    Carry  or  keep  at  hand  M8  and  M9  paper,  nerve  agent antidotes,  and  decontamination  kits.    Remove  contact  lenses.    Wear  protective  mask spectacles.    Enforce  hydration  standards,  work/rest  cycles,  and  buddy  checks.    Use MOPP 4 when attacks are imminent or in progress or when chemical, TIC, or biological contamination is suspected or present.  Individuals assume MOPP 4 when Alarm Red is declared  in  an  area  with  a  chemical-biological  threat.    Use  MOPP  4  to  provide  the maximum individual protection to personnel. A2.7.2.  MOPP Options.  Commanders may need to reduce the heat burden for personnel for some missions.  They may be forced to  choose between the possibility of increased CBRN exposure  or  casualties  and  the  certainty  of  increased  heat  casualties.    The  installation   176  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 commander  or  designated  representative  may  accept  the  increased  risk  and  authorize  IPE options to provide flexibility and to minimize IPE-related degradation.  IPE options may also be  used  when  agent  threats  do  not  require  full  body  protection.    Consult  with  EM  and  BE personnel to determine the most effective course of action. A2.7.2.1.  Mask-Only  Option.    Wear  the  protective  mask  only  without  the  hood.    Wear the  ABU,  BDU  or  flight  suit  with  sleeves  rolled  down.    Use  the  mask-only  option  to provide respiratory protection against biological agents (other than toxins like T2), RDD or  nuclear  fallout,  and  chemical  agent  downwind  hazards  that  are  not  a  percutaneous exposure danger.  The mask-only option can also be used for TICs that do not present a percutaneous  exposure  danger  and  for  which  the  filter  element  is  effective.    Use  the mask-only  option  after  post-attack  reconnaissance  is  complete.    This  variation  may  be used when personnel are protected from direct contact with solid or liquid contamination or in low vapor concentrations areas.  Commanders may direct that personnel also wear protective gloves with this option; thereby providing respiratory protection and covering the vast  majority of skin.   Should  a subsequent  attack occur, personnel  using the mask-only option will assume the directed IPE level. A2.7.2.2.  No  ABU,  BDU,  or  Flight  Suit  Option.    Under  this  option,  individuals  do  not wear the ABU/BDU or flight suit under the CPO.  This option reduces heat stress but is not a substitute for work/rest cycles.  This option increases the risk of skin contamination and vapor exposure.  The CPO may also  cause skin  irritation from  direct  contact  of the skin with activated charcoal in the cloth. A2.7.2.3.  Ventilation Option.  Personnel may open the CPO jacket to aid ventilation and reduce  thermal  build-up  under  command-specified  conditions.    The  ventilation  option involves  risk  because  some  chemical  and  TIC  vapors  can  be  absorbed  through  the  skin and may cause casualties over time.  Ventilation periods when agents are present must be limited to the minimum amount of time needed for heat relief.  The ventilation option is automatically  revoked  with  each  MOPP  level  increase,  unless  specifically  reauthorized by  the  commander.    Only  under  special  circumstances  (aftermath  of  a  biological  agent attack  for  instance)  combine  the  non  ABU  or  BDU,  and  the  Ventilation  options  as  the risk to personnel is too great. A2.7.3.  Wearing  Specialized  Clothing  and  Field  Gear.    Specialized  clothing  and  field equipment is normally worn over the CPO.  Examples are personal body armor, cold weather parkas and pants, hats and hoods, work gloves, load bearing equipment, and field accessories.  Size this equipment to the individual while they are wearing the CPO, gloves, and protective mask.  Larger sizes are required to enable a functional fit and unrestricted movement.  Adjust load  bearing  equipment  and  position  field  accessories  to  allow  proper  positioning  and carrying  of  the  protective  mask  and  canteen.    Clothing  intended  for  wear  underneath  the ABU/BDU  uniform,  flight  suit,  or  against  the  skin  may  be  worn  underneath  the  CPO.  Examples include the cold weather shirt and pants, personal body armor (T-shirt style), and undergarments.    Consider  that  some  of  these  additional  items  may  increase  heat  buildup.  Specialized equipment must be removable during CCA processing without compromising the integrity of the IPE.  Regardless of the method of wear, specialized clothing must not prevent proper wear of the individual protective equipment. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   177  A2.8.  IPE.  The USAF relies on protective masks, individual protective ensembles, and, where feasible,  on  collective  protection  systems  for  physical  protection  against  CB  agent  exposures.  Adequate  training  is  necessary  for  effective  mask  and  IPE  use.    Initial  issue  of  masks  and  IPE and support of scheduled IPE changes requires informed, coordinated logistics support. A2.8.1.  Scheduled  IPE  exchange  is  necessary  for  rest,  relief,  decontamination,  and  to counter protection limitations of the ensemble.    Collective protection  requires that facilities be  available,  stocked,  manned,  and  operations  preplanned.    Collective  protection  facilities provide filtered air "shirtsleeve" environments for work (command posts, crisis action teams, emergency operations centers, squadron operations, medical facilities) or rest and recovery. A2.8.2.  IPE protects the wearer from direct exposure to CBW agents.  The IPE consists of a protective mask, a protective suit of either coverall (CWU-66/P) or CPO (jacket and trouser) configurations, gloves and overboots.  The mask keeps agent from entering the body through the nose, mouth, or eyes; and the overgarment prevents skin contact, absorption through the skin,  and  entry  through  cuts  or  abrasions  of  the  skin.    Masks  provide  a  critical  and  unique form  of  protection  not  available  through  normal  combat  clothing,  whereas  protective  suits generally duplicate or enhance the protection offered by normal combat clothing.  Poor mask fit  and  careless  mask  donning  seriously  degrade  the  protection  the  ensemble  is  capable  of providing.    Hoods  provide  additional  head,  neck,  and  face  protection  from  gaseous  agents and  from  falling  agent  droplets.    Protective  garments  serve  as  a  barrier  between environmental agents and skin.  They can be fabricated from impermeable materials or from air-permeable  protective  materials,  which  rely  on  a  thin  layer  of  chemical  agent  absorbent carbon to prevent agent penetration.  This allows water vapor to escape and is generally more comfortable and cooler than impermeable materials. A2.9.  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).  The AF Surgeon General and AF Deputy Chief of Staff Logistics, Installations, and Mission Support will determine overall requirements.  It will be up to the installation responders to determine the proper IPE/PPE based on the hazards. A2.9.1.  Levels of Protection.  During routine operations, there are four levels of protection established  by  the  Occupational  Safety  &  Health  Administration  (OSHA).    Table  A2.7, illustrates the different levels of protection.  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is required to  support routine missions and hazardous material emergency  responses and is  certified to provide  protection  in  accordance  with  the  levels  of  protection  established  by  OSHA.    PPE can  be  used  during  contingency  operations  but  is  dependent  upon  the  level  of  risk  a commander is willing to accept at the time and mission requirements.  With few exceptions, military personnel are provided IPE, not PPE, for conventional CBRNE attacks. A2.9.2.  Other  Factors.   Other factors to  consider in  this selection process are matching the PPE  to  the  service-member‘s  mission  requirements  and  task-specific  conditions.    The durability of PPE materials, such as tear strength and seam strength, should be considered in relation to the member‘s tasks.  The effects of PPE in relation to heat stress and task duration are a factor in selecting and using PPE.  In some cases, layers of PPE may be necessary to provide sufficient protection, or to protect expensive PPE inner garments, suits or equipment.  The  more  that  is  known  about  the  hazards  at  the  site,  the  easier  the  job  of  PPE  selection becomes.    As  more  information  about  the  hazards  and  conditions  becomes  available,  the commander  can  make  decisions  to  up-grade  or  down-grade  the  level  of  PPE  protection  to match the tasks.   178  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Table A2.7.  Levels of Protection Level A - Protection should be worn when the highest level of respiratory, skin, eye and mucous membrane protection is needed. Level B - Protection should be selected when the highest level of respiratory protection is needed, but a lesser level of skin and eye protection.  Level B protection is the minimum level recommended on initial site entries until the hazards have been further identified and defined by monitoring, sampling, and other reliable methods of analysis, and equipment corresponding with those findings utilized. Level C - Protection should be selected when the type of airborne substance is known, concentration measured, criteria for using air-purifying respirators met, and skin and eye exposure is unlikely.  Periodic monitoring of the air must be performed. Level D - is primarily a work uniform and is used for nuisance contamination only.  It requires only coveralls and safety shoes/boots.  Other PPE is based upon the situation (types of gloves, etc.).  It should not be worn on any site where respiratory or skin hazards exist.  Refer to The Office of Emergency and Remedial Response.  Environmental Response Division.  See "Interim Standard Operating Safety Procedures" for full details.  The type of environment and the overall level of protection should be reevaluated periodically as the amount of information about the work environment increases and as workers are required to perform different tasks. Note:  Further explanation of Levels A, B, C, and D can be found in 29 CFR 1910.120, Appendix B. A2.9.3.    National Fire Protection Association Standards.  As an aid in selecting suitable protective clothing, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has developed standards.  The AF Protective Equipment Standards are listed in Table A2.8  These standards apply documentation and performance requirements to the manufacture of protective equipment.  It is recommended that protective equipment that meets these standards be used. Table A2.8.  AF Protective Equipment Standards DODI 6055.6 – DOD Fire and Emergency Services Program.

If required to evacuate, all personnel must be directed to evacuate an incident site in an upwind direction. In a non-CBRN environment, Security Forces may physically go door-to-door to notify effected personnel to evacuate or SIP. When notifying personnel in a building, such as a barracks, SF personnel may designate a buildings occupant to assist in notifying the other personnel within the building.  SF personnel will ensure building occupants know what direction in which to evacuate.  When CBRN hazards are known or suspected, SF will control the evacuation of personnel by directing evacuees to a dedicated rendezvous area as they approach or exit the cordon.  The BDOC may assist with the evacuation or SIP notifications via a landline notification to buildings identified within the cordon.  The removal of aircraft, missiles, and other equipment requiring specialized actions is the responsibility of the custodial forces.  If time and situations permit, personnel evacuating the area should remove critical equipment, vehicles, and materials from the danger area.  When evacuating personnel, the following priorities for evacuation are: injured personnel, endangered personnel, equipment carrying hazardous material, high-value or mission essential equipment, and fatalities.  When a Protection Level Restricted Area, CAT, EOC, or BDOC is affected and directed to evacuate, established installation operating instructions and plans will be followed.

The Cold Zone outer perimeter is established to prevent individuals from interfering with recovery operations and to keep innocent bystanders and onlookers from being hurt.  During a weapons or explosive threat, this perimeter should be established outside the maximum effective range of any weapon or fragmentation distance of the explosive.  SF will direct all vehicles and pedestrians not involved in recovery operations away from the incident scene.  Set up an ECP along the outer perimeter in an area that is easily accessible to responding units.  SF will send all persons who need to enter the area to the ECP.  Cold Zone inner perimeter for a hostile situation, normally, on-duty security forces personnel initially set up the inner perimeter to contain the immediate scene.  Specialized teams may replace security forces personnel posted on the inner perimeter if they are available and appropriate for use by the IC.  Security forces can adjust the inner perimeter as needed.  Due to the dangers, strict control of the area must be maintained.  Only key personnel such as the Emergency Services Team (EST), local Special Weapons and Tactics teams, negotiation teams, EOD, and the IC are allowed within the inner perimeter.  At this point, the installation commander could choose to have the lead agency assume control of the situation. Standard:  AFMAN 31-201, V4, High Risk Response Personnel:  Situation dependent Description:  N/A Description:  N/A Description:  SF at the MAJCOM or Installation level will develop SF First Responder PPE requirements and usage procedures for initial response to a CBRN incident, enemy attack, or terrorist use of CBRN.  SF at the installation will determine conventional protective equipment.  BE will determine what protective equipment SF personnel will require in a CBRN environment and will use the following guidance when determining respiratory protection.  The military gas mask provides a diverse range of CBRN airborne hazard protection to the wearer.  The military gas mask, like all respiratory protection, has limitations.  These limitations must be considered when planning and executing missions.  Local health and/or operational risk assessments by Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) may deem this mask inappropriate for local threats, and in those cases, their guidance must be followed.  During terrorist type CBRN events, OSHA stated (OSHA Letter of Interpretation, 24 May 2004) that 29 CFR 1910.120 requirements are only applicable to hazardous material incident responders (e.g. CEF, CEX, and BE) as their duties require them to remain in, enter, or respond to hazardous material sites.  Security Forces duties do not routinely fall under this category.  As such, the military gas mask can be used for escape protection during CBRN irregular warfare emergency responses by all military personnel and government civilian employees.  All security forces personnel issued military gas masks must be trained on the use, maintenance, and operational limitations of their masks by their servicing Readiness and Emergency Management Flight.  When a military gas mask is not available or is deemed ineffective for the potential threats, NIOSH certified respiratory protection will be procured with guidance and approval from Personnel:  N/A Personnel:  N/A Standard:  N/A Standard:  N/A 26 27 28 AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   189  Standard:  N/A Standard:  N/A Standard:  N/A Personnel:  N/A Personnel:  N/A Personnel:  N/A local BE personnel.

Shelter  Planning.  The installation commander directs  the BCE to  survey and designate appropriate rest and relief shelters.  Protection from CBRNE weapons effects will determine the suitability of buildings as shelters.  Likely threat conditions should be considered in the shelter selection  process  as  some  facilities  provide  better  protection  than  others  based  on  the  hazard involved.    For  example,  a  facility  that  provides  adequate  protection  from  chemical-biological agents  may  be  inadequate  in  regards  to  protecting  personnel  from  gamma  radiation.    The installation  commander  should  designate  unit  responsibility  for  preparing  and  operating  each shelter,  performing  CBRNE  Post  Attack  Reconnaissance  (PAR)  around  the  shelter,  and  Force Protection (FP) issues.  Units responsible for the shelters will prepare them by sealing cracks and holes, closing all doors and windows, and shutting down non-filtered ventilation systems at the appropriate time.  Refer to  Attachment  5  for decision tools to  determine the best  shelter areas with the least amount of contamination infiltration based on the unique aspects of CBRN agents. A4.1.1.  Plan  for  CBRNE  protection  based  on  the  threat  for  both  in-place  and  deployed operations.  Where possible, MAJCOMs should develop a single shelter management guide for  use  at  command  locations.    Shelters  may  be  used  to  facilitate  quarantine  or  isolation activities  in  the  event  of  naturally  occurring  or  man-made  disease  outbreaks.

MAJCOMs  specify  installation  shelter  exercise  requirements  for  peacetime  and wartime  contingencies.   Address  procedures  and  checklists,  C2,  shelter  supplies management, shelter occupation operations, extended sheltering operations, exposure control, and CCA processing, to include open air processing, during shelter evaluation. A4.1.4.  Installation  Commander. installation commander should:   To  implement  a  successful  shelter  program,  the A4.1.4.1.  Develop  a  comprehensive  protection  program  to  provide  sufficient  shelter spaces  for  peak  on-base  population,  for  military  and  emergency  essential  civilians (include  added  forces  projections  for  teams  and  supplies).    Determine  the  type  and quantity of shelters based on the threat, both peacetime and wartime.  Consider the use of open air CCAs and TFAs in CBRN threat areas. A4.1.4.2.  Plan shelter occupancy on a worst case basis to support assigned personnel and personnel that are relocated from another installation.  Include peacetime disaster shelter operations, to include appropriate evacuation activities, in local planning documents. A4.1.4.3.  For  preparatory  actions  covering  contingencies,  consider  a  phased  approach where limited resources are always available for contingency response, but total program requirements are not activated until the appropriate DEFCON or state or stage of alert.  In the  event  evacuation  is  required,  consider  a  phased  approach  where  non-essential activities  are  terminated  early  in  the  process  and  life-saving  capabilities  are  maintained until the last feasible stage.   216  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 A4.1.4.4.  Include  sheltering  scenarios  during  exercises  using  MAJCOM  criteria  in conjunction  with  installation  shelter  exercise  requirements  for  peacetime  and  wartime contingencies. A4.1.5.  Unit Commanders.  Unit commanders should: A4.1.5.1.  Tailor MAJCOM and American Red Cross (ARC) guidance, shelter materials, and publish unit and facility checklists for shelter operations as required. A4.1.5.2.  Deleted. A4.1.5.3.  Deleted. A4.1.5.4.  Deleted. A4.1.5.4.1.  Request  technical  training  on  shelter  management  fundamentals  and CBRN-related  equipment  or  procedures  from  the  Readiness  and  Emergency Management flight for all assigned SMT members. A4.1.5.4.2.  Request  systems  (i.e.,  collective  protection  facilities  and  components) training from the Base Civil Engineer or functional manager. A4.1.5.4.3.  Request shelter-stocking training from Services, when required. A4.1.5.5.  Ensure  required  equipment  inspections  are  performed  according  to  technical orders and MAJCOM or ARC guidance. A4.1.5.6.  Ensure  routine  maintenance  actions  on  detection  instruments,  available collective  protection  facilities,  and  other  personnel  protection  items  not  specifically tasked to maintenance functions are performed. A4.1.5.7.  Develop  a  shelter  floor  plan  diagram.    Changes  should  be  made  any  time structural modifications are made to the shelter. A4.1.5.8.  Consider  assigning  personnel  with  the  same  critical  Air  Force  specialties  to different  shelters  to  enhance  mission  continuation  capabilities  through  personnel dispersal. A4.1.5.9.  Stagger  work  shifts  and  rest  cycles,  as  the  mission  permits,  to  minimize bottlenecks during shelter processing. A4.1.5.9.1.  Plan supply and resupply actions to support extended shelter operations.  This  should  include  planning  for  shelter  operations  for  14  consecutive  days  after nuclear  fallout  peaks;  for  7  consecutive  days  after  the  onset  of  CBR  contamination; for shelter operations in deployed locations. A4.1.5.9.2.  Identify  enough  SMT  members  to  provide  24-hour  coverage  in  the shelter.    Ensure  SMT  members  do  not  have  conflicting  duties.    If  required  by  base support plans, identify and train selected unit personnel identified for mobilization in shelter  management  techniques.    If  a  home  station  CBRN  threat  does  not  exist, training is only required for the appropriate number of shelter management personnel necessary for natural disaster and major accident activities.  In these cases, should a subsequent  CBRN  threat  manifest  itself  –  the  threat  of  nuclear  war  for  instance, SMTs will be identified, trained, and equipped at the appropriate DEFCON, state or stage of alert. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   217  A4.1.5.9.3.  Train  SMTs to  operate, maintain, and perform  minor troubleshooting of the equipment within the shelter or that will be used by SMT personnel.  This should include  filtration  systems,  air  conditioning  and  heating  systems,  electrical  systems, sanitation  systems,  CBRN  detectors,  decontamination  systems,  and  communications systems.  For additional training, unit commanders should: A4.1.5.10.  Consider  the  mission,  work  and  rest  cycles,  and  the  previous  and  expected exposure to contamination before directing personnel to duty outside the shelter. A4.1.5.11.  Oversee the operation of the exposure control system.  When deactivating the shelter, units should collect all radiological logs and individual radiological dose records.  These logs should be given to the director of base medical services upon termination of shelter operations. A4.1.5.12.  Assign unit personnel to accomplish expedient shelter hardening measures as required. A4.1.6.  Medical Services.  The director of Base Medical Services should: A4.1.6.1.  Plan for medical treatment during shelter operations. A4.1.6.2.  Specify first  aid kit requirements for shelter operations.  If not pre-positioned in shelters, provide guidance concerning the delivery of these assets. A4.1.6.3.  Plan for, train, and equip the In-Place Patient Decontamination Team (IPPDT).  The primary mission of the IPPDT is to provide capability to remove or neutralize CBRN agents on casualties immediately prior to being admitted to the MTF.  This includes, as a minimum,  planning  for  patient  decontamination  layout,  resources,  and  procedures  at CCA and TFA locations. A4.1.7.  Force Support.  Force Support Squadron Commander should: A4.1.7.1.  Locally  determine  the  level  of  shelter  stocking  support  necessary  to  meet CEMP 10-2 and natural disaster planning requirements.  Develop a shelter stocking plan to  issue  available  food,  water,  and  clothing  stocks  to  shelter  supervisors.    Ensure installation  units  provide  appropriate levels  of  support,  as  required,  example: Transportation: vehicles and drivers; Supply: water, clothing, and replacement IPE. A4.1.7.1.1.  Not  physically  stock  shelters  during  local  exercises  and  IG  inspections.  The  shelter-stocking  plan  will  be  evaluated  for  locally  determined  requirements  by using specified transportation assets to deliver inventory sheets to each shelter and/or based on CEMP 10-2 planning. A4.1.7.1.2.  Provide  the  SMT  guidance  on  shelter  stocking  contained  in  the  shelter stocking plan. A4.1.7.2.  Within the shelter-stocking plan, address the need for self-directed recreational activities during shelter operations.  Take into consideration what can be purchased upon execution. A4.1.8.  Base Civil Engineer (BCE).  The BCE should: A4.1.8.1.  Plan  for  expedient  hardening  to  increase  shelter  protective  capability  during contingency operations.  Assist with bunker and revetment installation and repair.   218  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 A4.1.8.2.  Direct the performance of preventive maintenance and unit level maintenance on  available  collective  protection  systems,  to  include  those  categorized  as  equipment (i.e., survivable collective protection systems (SCPS), transportable collective protection systems (TCPS), etc.). A4.1.8.3.  Provide  and  maintain  systems  delivering  potable  water  used  to  sustain contingency operations. A4.1.8.4.  Train  SMTs troubleshooting and repair. in facility  and  equipment  operation  and  emergency A4.1.8.5.  The  Readiness  and  Emergency  Management  Flight  ,  trains  designated  SMTs in: A4.1.8.5.1.  Basic  concepts  of  shelter  management  and  operations  including  CCA management and processing. A4.1.8.5.2.  Selected shelter equipment use. A4.1.8.5.3.  CBRN-related subjects as required. A4.1.8.5.4.  Post-attack  damage  assessment  procedures, requirements. to include reporting A4.1.8.5.5.  Exposure control procedures when applicable. A4.1.8.6.  Plan for implementation of CCA and TFA procedures to include site selection, processing procedures, risk assessment, etc. A4.1.8.7.  Coordinate with Aircrew Flight Equipment on aircrew CCA processing. A4.1.9.  Aircrew Flight Equipment should: A4.1.9.1.  Plan and prepare for personnel deploying to locations where Aircrew Chemical Defense (ACD) shelter facilities exist. A4.1.9.2.  Prior  to  deployment  become  familiar  with  the  processing  procedures, capabilities, and other operational aspects of various collective protection systems. A4.1.9.3.  Make  every  effort  to  co-locate  aircrew  CCA/TFA  operations  with  base populace CCA/TFA operations established by the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and Readiness and Emergency Management Flight.    Refer to  AFMAN 11-301, Volume 3,  Aircrew/Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  Combat  Operations  for  aircrew  processing procedures.    Logistics,  security,  agent  detection,  hazard  predictions,  and  site  selection established  by  the  EOC/Readiness  and  Emergency  Management  Flight  will  enhance aircrew processing. A4.1.10.  Security Forces.  Incorporate into unit checklists security requirements necessary to protect CCA and TFA operations. A4.1.11.  Transportation.    Incorporate  into  unit  checklists  transportation  requirements necessary to sustain CCA and TFA operations. A4.1.12.  Individual.    Know  the  location  of  their  protective  shelter  and  understand  shelter processing procedures. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   219  A4.2.  Shelter Requirements.  Air Force units are allowed to use War Reserve Materiel (WRM) to  support  shelter  operations  to  support  our  National  Military  Strategy.    Accordingly,  although installation plans should reflect the existence and potential use of WRM assets, actual peacetime use  of  CBRN-related  WRM  must  be  limited  to  activities  accomplished  in  the  aftermath  of irregular warfare events involving CBRN materials.  AFI 25-101, provides more information on the WRM program. A4.2.1.  There  are  two  types  of  personnel  shelters:  emergency  operations  shelters,  where personnel  perform  essential  functions;  and  rest  and  relief  shelters,  where  personnel  obtain rest and relief between work shifts. A4.2.1.1.  Rest  and  relief  shelterees  normally  should  not  use  emergency  operations shelter space unless they work in the emergency operations shelter. A4.2.1.2.  Shelter  space  in  medical  facilities  normally  should  not  be  used  by  the  base populace for rest and relief purposes. A4.2.2.  Staffing consists of shelter supervisors, CCA supervisors, and assistants. A4.2.2.1.  Minimum team size, for emergency operations and rest and relief shelters used for  CBRN  protection  is  one  shelter  supervisor,  one  exposure  control  monitor,  and  one CCA supervisor per shift. A4.2.2.2.  The number of attendants required for CCA processing depends on the skill of the base populace in regards to processing, the protective ensemble they are wearing, and the required flow rate into the TFA. A4.2.3.  For nuclear fallout protection, planning factors should include: A4.2.3.1.  Providing  one  shelter  space  for  each  person  based  on  the  projected  peak  on-base population of military and emergency essential civilians. A4.2.3.2.  Planning for required supplies and equipment. A4.3.  Attack Prevention and Preparedness Actions.  Units should: A4.3.1.  Recall  shelter  teams  and  activate  shelters.    This  involves  training  SMTs  and  CCA team  members,  implementing  operating  directives  and  checklists,  obtaining  and  checking equipment  and  supplies,  and  preparing  the  shelters  for  occupancy.    Pre-position  personal gear, equipment, food, clothing, first aid supplies, and hygiene kits for occupants. A4.3.2.  Improve  shelter  survivability  both  inside  and  out.    Internal  improvements  include boarding and covering windows, doors, and other openings; securing loose articles; placing excess furniture and equipment along inside of external walls; and, when necessary, moving people  to  the  innermost  part  of  the  shelter.    External  improvements  include  revetting  or placing earth berms or sandbags against the shelter to increase protection. A4.3.3.  Control entry and exit through a central point. A4.3.4.  During  conventional  warfare  activities,  all  SMTs  must  have  the  ability  to  detect, measure, and document radiation type, intensities, and doses if the enemy possesses nuclear weapons and be able to detect chemical warfare agents in liquid form if a chemical warfare threat  exists.    SMTs  for  collective  protection  facilities  must  have  the  ability  to  detect chemical  agents  in  vapor  form  inside  the  TFA  if  a  chemical  warfare  threat  exists.    Note:    220  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Personnel  may  require  off-base  relocation  if  there  are  insufficient  rest  and  relief  shelter spaces.   Relocation  should  be  consistent  with  theater  directives,  major  command requirements,  logistics  capabilities,  security  for  personnel  and  resources,  and  local  area capability. A4.4.  Attack Response Actions.  SMTs should: A4.4.1.  Suspend shelter in and out processing and secure doors. A4.4.2.  Instruct  personnel  to  take  cover  within  the  confines  of  the  shelter.    Personnel  may use splinter protected or expediently hardened shelter CCAs and other covered areas for blast and shrapnel protection. A4.4.3.  Instruct personnel to don IPE items if required. A4.4.4.  Monitor overpressure and filtration systems for proper operations, when applicable. A4.5.  Attack Recovery Actions.  SMTs should: A4.5.1.  Check for damage, unexploded ordnance, casualties, and determine if contamination is present in or around the outside shelter area.  Report any findings to the EOC through the CBRN Control Center. A4.5.1.1.  If  available,  verify  the  integrity  of  the  filtration  and  over  pressurization systems.    Direct  personnel  in  the  shelter  to  use  the  appropriate  amount  of  individual protection. the  appropriate A4.5.1.2.  Initiate level  of  CBRN  material  decontamination.  Decontaminate  and  process  equipment  through  a  CCA.    Remove  protective  coverings from  items  before  placing  them  in  the  airlock.    Remove  vapor  contamination  from equipment and supplies by allowing the items to off gas.  Note:  Decontaminate masks in the CHA/VHA and pass them into the TFA (in a sealed water-proofing bag) following a chemical attack. A4.6.  Shelter Equipment.  Each shelter should have a shelter kit.  Contents may vary; however, each kit should have: A4.6.1.  First aid kit sufficient for the expected number of shelterees and their likely medical needs. A4.6.2.  Floor  plan  identifying  preplanned  areas  (to  include  key  item  locations,  e.g., dosimeters,  other  detection  and  warning  devices,  and  fire  extinguishers)  and  emergency utility shut off locations. A4.6.3.  Base  grid  map  with  medical  facilities,  shelters,  control  centers,  and  key  phone numbers indicated. A4.6.4.  SMT identification devices. A4.6.5.  T.O.s and operational manuals for the shelter system, other support equipment, and specialized equipment. A4.6.6.  Shelter directives and operational checklists to cover all shelter operation aspects. A4.6.7.  Administrative  supplies  needed  for  maintaining  personnel  accountability,  exposure control, and log of events, etc. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   221  A4.6.8.

RADIACS.    Recommended  radiological  detection  and  monitoring  equipment for use during shelter operations include; EPDs and batteries and ADM-300 Radiacs. A4.6.9.  Shelter Checklist and Sign Requirements. A4.6.9.1.  Checklist  Requirements.    In  most  cases,  checklists  should  be  specific  enough to allow an untrained person to accomplish all needed actions. A4.6.9.2.  The unit should develop checklists for UCC and shelter interface. A4.6.9.3.  The  SMT  should  develop  implementing  instructions  for  shelter  operation.  These  instructions  should  include  activation,  shelter  operation,  equipment  operation, contamination  control,  and  deactivation  for  their  specific  shelter.    In  addition,  the  SMT may require untrained assistants for specific tasks necessary in the shelter.  The number of assistants, task distribution, and combining of tasks are flexible and determined by the SMT.    The  SMT  should  develop  the  following  checklists  for  untrained  assistants  to follow: A4.6.9.3.1.  Casualty Care Tasks.  Establish a first aid and buddy care capability for the  shelter.    Arrange  for  casualty  transportation  to  casualty  collection  points  or medical facilities, if necessary. A4.6.9.3.2.  Security  Tasks.    Secure  all  points  of  entry  or  exit  when  the  shelter  is operational.    Use  only  one  entrance  and  exit.    Provide  security  for  supplies  and equipment critical to the mission.  Maintain order and discipline in the shelter. A4.6.9.3.3.  Fire Control Tasks.  Inspect the shelter each shift to identify potential fire sources.    Brief  shelterees  on  fire  suppression  equipment  location  and  ensure  it  is operational.    Plan  for  evacuation  in  case  the  shelter  becomes  uninhabitable.  Designate reassembly points and a method to ensure everyone is evacuated. A4.6.9.3.4.  Supply  Tasks.    Coordinate  consumable  resupply  with  the  control  center responsible for the consumables. A4.6.9.3.5.  Subsistence  Tasks.    Follow  guidance  from  Force  Support  Squadron.  Implement the shelter stocking plan. A4.6.9.3.6.  Sanitation  Tasks.    Plan  for  and  maintain  sanitation  in  the  shelter  to prevent  disease.    Remove  solid  waste  (garbage,  trash,  unusable  clothing,  etc.)  from the  shelter  on  a  regular  basis.    Usually,  this  can  be  done  as  shelterees  out  process.  Human waste disposal is another critical area.  Use built-in toilet systems and plan for back-up systems in emergencies.  If the shelter does not have a built-in toilet, develop a  make  shift  system.    Consider  using  trash  cans  with  garbage  bag  liners.    Frequent AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   223  removal is required.  Plan for shelterees to clean their hands before dining, after toilet use, and after handling garbage to minimize disease. A4.6.9.3.7.  Administrative  Tasks.    Keep  an  events  log  from  the  time  the  shelter  is activated  until  deactivation.    Include  all  significant  events  for  the  shelter,  directed actions  from  higher  authority,  and  communications  between  the  shelter  and  the CBRN control center.  Report casualties and deceased persons to the CBRN control center for relay to the medical control center, mortuary control center, and personnel readiness unit.  Take all shelter administrative records when evacuating. A4.6.9.3.8.  Mortuary  Tasks.    Report  all  deaths  as  soon  as  possible,  and  follow  the mortuary control center instructions for remains disposition. A4.6.9.3.9.  Sleeping  Tasks.    Plan  for  and  operate  a  sleeping  area  for  the  shelter.  Provide sleeping accommodations for each expected shelter occupant. A4.6.9.3.10.  Recreation Tasks.  Plan and conduct regular recreation sessions during extended shelter operations. A4.7.  Toxic  Free  Areas.  If  personnel  shelters  do  not  have  collective  protection  then  another means must be provided for rest and relief of personnel.  Shelter operations should include steps to  determine  the  number  of  non-mission  essential  personnel  who  require  toxic-free  area sheltering.  Commanders will plan for toxic-free areas, which are located well away from liquid, vapor contaminated areas, and address logistical, transportation and civil engineer support for the rest and relief of personnel. A4.7.1.  Shelters are structures that protect from the effects of CBRN contamination.  Walls, doors,  and  windows  offer  limited  physical  barriers  to  the  penetration  of  contamination.  Although filter systems in heating, ventilation, and cooling systems can remove certain levels of  particulates,  they  should  be  shut  down  to  prevent  unnecessary  spread  of  contamination.  Unless employed in combination with other types of weapons, CB weapons normally involve less  destructive  force,  so  that  the  agent  can  be  disseminated  without  destroying  it  in  the dispersal  process.    Collective  protection  (ColPro)  systems  protect  those  inside  a  building, room,  shelter  or  tent  against  contamination  through  the  combination  of  non-penetrable structural materials, air filtration equipment, air locks, and over pressurization. A4.7.2.  ColPro  systems  enable  personnel  to  work  or  gain  rest  and  relief  without  the encumbrance  of  IPE.    If  ColPro  systems  are  not  available  and  CBRN  contamination  is present  and  persists  beyond  a  few  hours,  it  may  become  necessary  to  locate  and  designate toxic-free areas for rest and relief. A4.8.  SIP.  The goal of SIP is to minimize the exposure of personnel to accidental or intentional airborne  HAZMAT  releases  from  transportation  modes  and  storage  facilities  (e.g.,  Railroad tankers,  tractor  trailers,  or  storage  facilities);  day-to-day  use  (e.g.,  farms  or  sewage  treatment plants);  terrorist  use  of  CBRNE.    Facilities  provide  substantial  protection  if  air  is  filtered, temporarily interrupted, or reduced.  Interrupting the air flow is the basic principle applied during SIP.    Personnel  make  a  shelter  out  of  where  they  are.    People  are  directed  to  go/stay  indoors when  an  airborne  hazard  exists.    Speed  is  essential  for  SIP  to  work.    The  quicker  actions  are taken the less airborne contaminants will enter the facility.  SIP uses the building and its indoor atmosphere to temporarily separate people from a hazardous outdoor atmosphere.  Personnel are still  in  the  danger  area  but  will  be  protected  by  a  barrier  created  by  the  facility  and  its  indoor   224  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 atmosphere.  SIP, if done properly, has been proven to provide substantial temporary (one to two hours) protection from outdoor concentrations high enough to cause injury. A4.8.1.  For radiological materials, the amount of protection provided by SIP depends upon the building‘s protection factor (PF).  The larger the PF, the more protection provided.  For example, people inside a building with a PF of two will receive one-half of the dose received by unprotected personnel outside the shelter.  People inside a building with a PF of 100 will only receive 1/100th of the dose received by personnel outside.  Because of the penetrating power  of  gamma  radiation  and  the  lengthy  hazard  duration  timelines  associated  with radiological incidents, evacuation after the hazard cloud has passed over the area is generally the  best  response  in  order  to  keep  cumulative  doses  as  low  as  reasonably  achievable.    For chemical,  TIC,  and  biological  materials,  the  amount  of  protection  provided  by  SIP  varies mainly with the air tightness of the facility and the length of time the building is exposed to a hazardous  plume.    Modern,  energy  efficient  and  weatherized  buildings  provide  the  most effective  air  movement  barrier  and  require  the  least  amount  of  additional  sealing.    Each facility  must  be  evaluated  and  determinations  made  on  whether  SIP  is  an  option  or  if evacuation is needed. A4.8.2.  Buildings  can  provide  protection  in  varying  degrees  against  airborne  hazards  that originate  from  the  outside.    Such  protection  is  limited,  however  and  effective  only  under certain  conditions.    Conversely,  the  hazards,  to  personnel  inside  the  shelter,  produced  by  a release inside the building, can be much more severe than a similar release outside.  Because buildings allow only a limited exchange of air between the inside and outside, not only can higher  concentrations  occur  when  there  is  a  release  inside  or  directly  into  a  building,  but inside hazards are more likely to last longer. A4.8.3.  Commanders  must  be  aware  of  the  effects  SIP  will  have  on  systems  within  the shelter  and  pre-plan  emergency  actions.    Certain  command,  control,  communication,  and computer systems are dependent on air conditioning and shutting down heating, ventilation, and  air  conditioning  (HVAC)  may  cause  damage  or  loss  of  mission  capability.    They  must decide if the mission must continue even at a greater risk to occupants or whether it will be transferred to  an alternate location.   If operational  risk management determines the mission must  continue  consideration  should  be  given  to  providing  those  locations  without  ColPro with  personal  protective  equipment  such  as  respiratory  and  skin  protection.    Life  safety  is paramount  during  peacetime  operations.    Commanders  should  also  determine  who  might authorize HVAC to be shut down and if the mission will be transferred, taking into account speed of implementation and effect on the mission.  Units should dedicate funding for HVAC improvements  within  their  facilities,  which  provide  for  use  of  interior,  recirculated  air  or rapid shut down of systems, with minimal impact to personnel. A4.8.4.  Most  strategies  to  protect  people  from  airborne  hazards  require  some  advanced warning or a means of detecting the hazard.  Advanced warning may be  provided from  the Security Forces, Air Force Office of Special Investigations or other sources and disseminated through the various installation C2 networks.  Depending upon the type of material, hazard detectors may be used to provide warning of a release.  Although effective and inexpensive devices are widely available for detecting smoke and fire, there is limited detection that can rapidly  alert  occupants  to  a  broad  range  of  CBRN  hazards.    If  advanced  warning  is  not provided and detectors are not available, personnel must initially react to the situation based upon what they see, hear, feel and smell. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   225  A4.8.5.  In  the  absence  of  an  advanced  warning,  people  can  also  be  alerted  to  an  airborne hazard  by  observing  symptoms  or  effects  in  others.    This  provides  a  practical  means  for initiating  protective  actions  because  the  susceptibility  to  HAZMAT  varies  from  person  to person.    These  variations  may  present  a  greater  hazard  to  some  occupants  than  to  others.  Other  warning  signs  of  a  hazard  may  involve  seeing  and  hearing  something  out  of  the ordinary, such as the hissing sound caused by the rapid release from a pressurized cylinder or an  unusual  number  of  dead  birds,  animals,  or  discolored  plant  life.    Awareness  to  warning properties,  and  signs  and  symptoms  in  other  people  provide  the  basis  for  taking  protective actions. A4.8.6.  To  define  protective  measures  for  buildings  and  individual  protective  actions, releases are divided into two general types: external and internal building releases. A4.8.6.1.  External  releases  may  result  from  accidents  involving  industrial  storage  or transport, fires or malicious acts.  The downwind airborne hazard produced by the release is  referred  to  as  the  plume  or  cloud.    The  airborne  hazard  from  an  external  release normally  ends  when  the  release  ends  and  the  plume  moves  downwind.    However, depending on the type of agent or material released and the environmental conditions, the plume  passage  may  not  necessarily  mean  that  there  is  no  residual  hazard.    Some construction materials, such as bricks or asphalt used on roads or roofs, may absorb the agent while other surfaces may hold the agent. A4.8.6.1.1.  An important consideration is that in external releases, the source of the hazard is almost always at or near ground level.  With a ground level release of gases or  aerosols  at  night  and  during  periods  from  1-2  hours  before  and  after  sunrise  or sunset,  the  plume  tends to  remain  at  ground  level.    If  not,  the  plume  is  diluted  as  it rises under conditions that typically occur on sunny days. A4.8.6.1.2.  Canyon  Effect.    Buildings  or  other  structures  channel  the  downwind plume  movement.    They  can  also  confine  and  concentrate  the  cloud  within  built-up areas such as warehouse and industrial areas of an installation. A4.8.6.1.3.  For biological and some chemical releases, the plume may also contain a fine aerosol of solid or liquid particles.  Depending upon the wind speed and particle size, the heavier particles will fall  closest  to  the  release point while lighter particles will  fall  farther  downwind.    After  the  particles  reach  the  surface,  the  respiratory hazard may be reduced, but is not eliminated.  Depending upon the agent or material and environmental  conditions,  these particles may  continue to  be a contact  or vapor hazard.    However,  they  do  not  present  an  immediate  contact  hazard  to  personnel inside  a  shelter  in-place-protected  building  or  those  correctly  wearing  appropriate IPE/PPE. A4.8.6.1.4.  For  radiological  releases,  incident  commanders  will  have  to  decide whether it is more hazardous to keep personnel inside the facility or  if it is better to expose  personnel  to  low  doses  to  get  them  out  of  the  hazardous  area.    Incident commanders should refer to the decision tools in  Attachment  5.  Some radiological materials  will  pose  a  greater  risk  to  personnel  that  remain  in  the  shelter  for  1  to  2 hours because of their production of gamma radiation.  In order to be as effective as possible,  commanders  must  determine  which  critical  missions  will  likely  need  to continue, whether or not the critical mission can continue in place or whether it will   226  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 need to be relocated, and what sheltering and evacuation options are available for the base population prior to radiological events. A4.8.6.1.5.  The radiological hazards generated by the fallout from an IND explosion are far more dangerous than the comparatively small amounts of radiation released by an RDD or RED.  If the installation is located in an area of the hazard plume that is expected to deliver lethal radioactive doses to personnel in a short time (hours), it is probable  that  the  installation  commander  will  consider  the  feasibility  of  evacuating non-essential  personnel  to  areas  outside  of  the  affected  area.    However,  this  action may  not  be  executable  if  time  is  limited,  the  affected  area  is  too  large,  and/or  the installation  is  located  in  or  near  a  city  that  is  simultaneously  trying  to  evacuate millions of personnel.   Consequently, installation leadership may instead direct base personnel to report to the best shelters available throughout the installation in order to minimize personnel exposures.  These facilities may be formally designated shelters, or in some cases selected work centers and/or basements of base housing units.  The rapid  establishment  and  effective  utilization  of  a  shelter  network,  which  is  likely dormant  on the installation except  perhaps for use in  natural  disaster situations, will be  challenging.    Pre-planning  will  be  the  key  to  success  i.e.,  identifying  which facilities  are  best  suited  for  this  specific  activity,  procedure  for  notifying  the  base population of where to report and what to bring with them, selection and just-in-time training (anticipated to be virtual training in many cases) of shelter management team members,  etc.    For  further  information  on  the  use,  challenges,  and  corresponding mitigating strategies associated with sheltering in an IND fallout situation, refer to the Shelter  Management  Activities  for  an  Attack  Involving  an  Improvised  Nuclear Device  posted  on the  AFCESA  Emergency  Management  web  portal (https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-A9). A4.8.6.2.  Internal  hazardous  material  or  military  agent  releases  may  occur  inside  the building and could affect all occupants.  Depending upon the release location and type of hazardous material, the building will normally contain the release and present little or no hazard  to  personnel  outside  of  the  building.    Personnel  inside  the  building  may  be affected if they are within the immediate area of the release or if the airborne material is distributed  to  other  areas  through  the  building  HVAC  system.    In  most  cases,  the response to an internal release will be to warn building occupants, attempt to contain the hazard  within  the  immediate  area  of  the  release  and  evacuate  the  building.    Those evacuating  should  assemble  at  a  pre-designated  area  and  await  assistance.    If  possible separate  those  contaminated  from  those  uncontaminated.    In  some  instances,  it  may  be difficult to determine between those that are contaminated and those that are not. A4.8.7.  The concept of sheltering in place is to close all openings to the outside and attempt to  restrict the exchange  of air from  the outside to the inside.  These preparations should be accomplished before the arrival of a contaminant cloud.  Given adequate warning, additional measures should be taken, such as sealing openings with plastic sheeting and tape and using available IPE/PPE.  The amount of protection afforded by sheltering in place varies with the air  exchange  factors  previously  discussed.    Based  on  the  levels  of  sealing,  there  are  four levels of sheltering in place: AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   227  A4.8.7.1.  Normal Sheltering Level.  Close all windows and doors and turn off all HVAC equipment  that  does  not  use  interior,  re-circulated  air.    Facilities  with  HVAC  shut  off switches should be shut off by the facility managers. A4.8.7.2.  Expedient Sheltering Level.  The procedures of expedient sheltering are based on  an  assumption that  there  are  techniques  that  can  be  applied  with  little or  no  training and  with  commonly  available  materials  to  reduce  the  air  exchange  rate.    Take  rapid measures to enhance protection, such as taping doors, windows and electrical outlets and placing  rolled,  wet  towels  at  door  bottom.    Selecting  and  sealing  one  room  can  also provide a higher protection level by reducing the air exchange rate.  Testing has indicated that  a  room  sealed  with  plastic  sheeting  and  tape  provides  10  times  the  protection  than that available in the remainder of the house. A4.8.7.3.  Enhanced  Sheltering  Level.    Caulk  joints,  apply  weather  strips,  install  storm windows and make other modifications to reduce air infiltration.  This is a preparedness activity as opposed to a technique that can be accomplished at the time of execution. A4.8.7.4.  Pressurized Sheltering Level.  Use gas-particulate filter blowers to increase the inside  pressure  so  that  it  exceeds  the  outside  pressure  and  provide  filtered  air.    The positioning of these devices is a preparedness activity as opposed to a technique that can be accomplished at the time of execution. A4.8.8.1.  Implementation.  The implementation of SIP requires planning to: A4.8.8.1.1.  Ensure that occupants know how to take protective measures. A4.8.8.1.2.  Determine that a CBRN release has occurred. A4.8.8.1.3.  Determine areas that may be affected by the release. A4.8.8.1.4.  Communicate a timely warning to all people in the affected areas. A4.8.8.1.5.  Communicate the appropriate time to vacate in-place shelters. A4.8.8.1.6.  Turn off the HVAC systems that do not use interior, recirculated air prior to the arrival of the cloud and activate the HVAC systems after the cloud passes. A4.8.9.  HVAC Recommendations for SIP.   Following  are the requirements,  considerations for implementation and low cost options for buildings where such switches are not required. A4.8.9.1.  Antiterrorism  requirement  for  facilities  are  found  in  UFC  4-010-01.    The standard  makes  HVAC  shut  down  switches  mandatory  for  new  inhabited  buildings  and when  existing  inhabited  buildings  have  undergone  major  renovations  where  such  costs exceed 50 percent of the replacement cost of the facility or if a facility, have undergone a conversion of use.  See the UFC for complete details.  In all other facilities, such switches are recommended but not required. A4.8.9.2.  When  equipping  a  building  with  a  HVAC  system(s)  shut  down  switch,  it should be located so as to be easily accessible by building occupants.  In most buildings, it should be located by the fire alarm panel.  If the building has controlled access or has functions manned 24/7, consider locating the switch at those locations.  If the facility is on  an  Energy  Management  and  Control  System  (EMCS),  the  HVAC  system  should  be capable  of  being  shut  down  either  by  the  EMCS  operator  or  by  the  occupants  at  the   228  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 facility.    Either  way,  an  indicator  light  located  by  the  shut  down  switch  at  the  building should indicate system operating status. A4.8.9.3.  For  buildings  with  HVAC  lacking  shutdown  switches  there  are  several  low cost modifications to the HVAC system that can improve its effectiveness for sheltering in place.  Equip the HVAC system with the highest rated Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) filter it can accommodate.  Though not absolute like a charcoal and high efficiency  particulate  air  filter  combination,  changing  from  a  MERV  7  to  a  MERV  14 filter  can  significantly  improve  the  removal  rates  for  CB  agents.    Many  systems  can accommodate  a  higher  rated  filter  without  modifications.    However,  before  replacing filters,  one  should  determine  from  the  HVAC  system‘s  manufacturer  or  designer  the maximum  static  pressure  drop  across  the  air  filter  without  adversely  impacting  system performance.    Make  sure  you  take  into  account  loading  of  the  filter  when  selecting  the filter with the highest MERV rating.  Note:  Increasing static pressure drop will require increasing fan speed to maintain the same air flow rates.  If fan speed must be increased, check  the  fan  motor  to  confirm  it‘s  not  being  overloaded.    In  addition,  an  increase  in static pressure across the filters may prevent condensate from draining properly in some units and will require increasing the depth of the water trap. A4.8.9.4.  Though building modification is involved, raising the air intake louvers 10 feet above  ground  level  reduces  the  possibility  and/or  concentration  of  agents  entering  the building.  Raising air intake can be considerably less expensive than installing shut down switches. A4.8.9.5.  There  are  actions  the  occupants  should  take  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of sheltering  in  place  when  the  buildings  lack  a  HVAC  shut  down  switch.    Seal  off  the outside  air  louvers  and  inside  the  building,  the  exhaust  air  grills  (located  in  bathrooms, copy room, snack bar etc.) with tape and plastic.  Have CE identify the location of these louvers  and  grills.    One  does  not  want  to  mistakenly  seal  off  the  return  air  registers (mistaking them for exhaust grills) since doing so will increase the suction on the outside air louver, causing the plastic seal to fail.  Move personnel to interior rooms and shut off all unnecessary lights and equipment. A4.8.10.  The  options  represented  below  are  an  example  of  the  reasoning  process  for implementing a viable SIP program.   By incorporating all the considerations and principles discussed above, an installation may follow a similar thought process to develop options for implementing their SIP. A4.8.10.1.  Option  1:  Allow  facility  owners/users  to  shut  off  HVAC  locally  using automated Local Area Network based controls (Variable cost – Low risk). A4.8.10.1.1.  Authorization to  access  this system must be worked out  with CE prior to an emergency. A4.8.10.1.2.  Using this option with existing automated controls (Low cost). A4.8.10.1.3.  Retrofitting facilities to have this capability (High cost). A4.8.10.2.  Option 2: Panic switch placed within the building either at a control center or central location (Medium cost – Low risk). AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   229  A4.8.10.2.1.  Installation  of  panic  switches  may  require  extensive  wiring  depending on the building. A4.8.10.3.  Option  3  (Least  tenable):  Manual  shutdown  of  HVAC  (No  cost  –  Variable risk based on details of the HVAC system). A4.8.10.3.1.  A  manual  shutdown  requires  detailed  instructions  and  extensive training. A4.8.11.  See AFTTP(I) 3-2.46, for additional details concerning SIP instructions. A4.9.  Collective  Protection  (COLPRO).  The  purpose  of  COLPRO to  produce  a temperature-controlled,  toxic-free  area  (TFA)  where  operations,  rest  and  relief,  and  medical treatment, to name a few, can continue without protective equipment.  COLPRO systems protect those  inside  a  building  against  contamination  through  the  combination  of  non-penetrable structural  materials,  air  filtration  equipment,  air  locks,  and  over  pressurization.    The  most appropriate collective protection solution(s) can be determined based on the most likely threats and mission requirements. is A4.9.1.  Classes  of  Collective  Protection.    COLPRO  is  designed  to  house  or  protect  large numbers  of  personnel  when  advanced  warning  permits  the  mass  movement  of  personnel away  from  those  areas  most  vulnerable  to  attack  and  must  be  provided  for  in-place  and deployed  personnel  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  MAJCOM  guidance.    Refer  to  Table  A4.6  Classes of Collective Protection. A4.9.1.1.  Class  I  through  IV  collective  protection  shelters  provide  clean,  filtered  air inside a facility located in a contaminated area.  However, collective protection designed for use in chemical and biological environments may not offer sufficient shielding from penetrating radiation unless it is modified.  COLPRO filters can prevent the introduction of  airborne  radioactive  materials  into  a  facility.    However,  it  is  important  to  note  that filters  designed  to  collect  particles  will  concentrate  the  radioactive  particles  into  a modified  point  source  (also  called  a  radiological  exposure  device,  or  RED).    Class  V refers to shelter-in-place facilities and entails improving the protection factor of existing buildings by sealing off windows and HVAC systems for short periods of time.  Class V shelters  optimized  for  protecting  occupants  from  airborne  contamination  may  not  offer sufficient shielding to protect occupants from penetrating radiation (gamma). A4.9.1.2.  Shelters  are  structures  that  protect  personnel  from  the  effects  of  CBRN contamination over extended periods.  Walls, doors, and windows offer limited physical barriers  to  the  penetration  of  contamination.    Although  filter  systems  in  heating, ventilation, and cooling systems can remove certain levels of particulates, they should be shut  down  to  prevent  unnecessary  spread  of  contamination.    CBR  weapons  normally involve  less  destructive  force,  unless  employed  in  combination  with  other  types  of weapons, so that agent can be disseminated without destroying it in the dispersal process.   230   AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Table A4.6.

Chemical  Decision  Tools.  Chemical  Duration  Tables  are  posted  on  the  Air  Force Emergency Management Community of Practice.  In the preparation and preparedness phases, it is  important  to  inventory  detection  and  sustainment  equipment  and  supplies.    Identify  the detector  sensitivities,  the  appropriate  equipment  technical  orders,  and  the  threshold  level  of detection expected for each threat agent/material under current and projected weather conditions. A5.1.1.  For  chemical  attacks,  it  is  recommended  that  initial  tests  for  vapor  be  conducted using  all  available  detectors.    If  the  initial  tests  are  positive,  follow-on  tests  should  be conducted using only the least sensitive field detectors until they indicate agent vapor is no longer present  (reaches that  detector‘s threshold).  Then begin tests  with  the most sensitive field  detector  until  the  tests  indicate  the  agent  is  no  longer  present  (reaches  that  detector‘s threshold). A5.1.2.  Once  the  most  sensitive  detector  can  no  longer  detect  agent  presence,  the  test location has reached the Baseline Risk level and all subsequent hazard prediction and health risk  assessment  for  that  location  is  the  primary  responsibility  of  the  BE.    Figure  A5.1, illustrates  this  process  for  VX  and  GB.    Other  detectors  may  be  used  based  on  availability (refer to Table A5.1. Figure A5.1.  Chemical Attack Baseline and Residual Risk Analysis Process (Notional)  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   233  A5.1.3.  The  relative  difference  between  the  amount  of  CW  agent  released  in  the  air,  in milligrams per meter cubed (mg/m3) as shown in Table A5.1, necessary for various detectors to have a chance in making a positive identification.  The baseline indicates the concentration of  CW  agent  required  to  observe  negligible  human  effects  according  to  the  EPA‘s  AEGL derivation  in  NRC  Vol.  3  EPA  at  http://www.epa.gov/oppt/aegl/pubs/tsd21.pdf.    AEGL results are at http://www.epa.gov/oppt/aegl/pubs/results21.htm.  A5.1.3.1.  Values represent the difference between the actual onset of symptoms and the concentration necessary to elicit a positive detection for each detector.  For example, the sensitivity of the M256A1 would provide a positive identification for GB before a person at  the  same  location  would  be  expected  to  experience  negligible  effects  whereas  the CAM is not expected to detect the agent until the concentration is above that necessary to observe negligible effects. A5.1.3.2.  These  values  represent  the  total  concentration  necessary  to  exhibit  negligible effects.  Smaller doses of any CW agent over longer periods are expected to cause similar effects.  Although the concentration of CW agent may be below the detector threshold, it can still cause miosis if enough time is spent in a contaminated area.  AFTTP (I) 3-2.55 provides  toxicity  values  for  mild  effects  as  ECt50  (higher  than  the  lowest  limit  of  the negligible ECt01 documented by USACHPPM/EPA. A5.1.3.3.  Concentrations in air.  The units in Table A5.1, represent the concentration of each agent in air required to cause each detector to alarm.  Some concentrations are given in  milligrams  per  cubic  meter  (mg/m3)  whereas  others  are  given  in  terms  of  parts  per billion or million  (ppb or ppm).  To determine  which detector is  most sensitive to  each agent one must realize that 1 ppb is less than 1 ppm, which is smaller than 1 mg/m3 for the  agents  in  Table  A5.1.    See  Table  3.7,  for  information  regarding  how  to  convert mg/m3 to ppm and vice versa.   234  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 A5.1.3.4.  Figure A5  2., illustrates another method to determine the deposition and type of agent used during an attack.  The deposition category in the figure indicates how much of  the  agent  was  released  in  that  particular  area  and  provides  additional  information  on how  long  contamination  will  remain  a  hazard  for  personnel,  which  protective  measures are required, and risks to personnel operating in the area.

Figure A5.2.  M8 Paper Deposition Guide A5.2.  Biological  Decision  Tools.  Biological agent detector thresholds for instruments that use immunoassay technologies are illustrated in Figure A5.3  The figure refers to the amount of BW agent  released  in  the  air  for  these  detectors,  which  have  relatively  low  sensitivity,  to  have  a chance in collecting the sample and making a positive identification.  The dose value represents the dose for 50% of the population to develop onset of symptoms.  For example, the sensitivity of these detectors for anthrax is at the level where a person at the same location would have been exposed to a dose approximately 40 times a single dose that would cause symptoms for 50% of  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   237  the  population.    The  implication  is  that  many  attacks  of  lesser  concentration  could  produce significant  casualties  and  never  be  positively  identified  until  the  samples  were  tested  using another  technology  (such  as  that  used  with  JBAIDS,  for  instance).    The  data  is  based  on:    Dr. Peter Emanuel,  US  Army  Critical  Reagents  Program,  Chemical  Biological  Medical  Systems  of the Research Development and Engineering Command (RDE COM).

The area above the baseline indicates the detector is less sensitive than the human body.  Alternatively, the area below the baseline indicates a positive identification is more likely before infection in 50% of the population is likely.  Detector sensitivity is relative to the human body's sensitivity to each agent as indicated by a dose that is likely to infect 50% of the population in a given area.  A5.3.

Commanders use the flow diagram shown in Figure A5.5, as a guide for responding to an RED event.  The flow diagram is for situations in which the RED was discovered, using radiation  detectors  for  example.    In  the  event  that  people  begin  showing  up  at  the  medical treatment  facility  with  symptoms  of  acute  radiation  syndrome,  the  first  mitigation  measure would be to use available radiation detectors to locate the radiation source that was causing the people to become sick.  For detailed information on how to locate an RED based on the presence  of  an  initial  dosimeter/detector  reading,  refer  to  the  ―Finding  REDs‖  material located on the Air Force Emergency Management Community of Practice.  Once an RED is   238  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 located, use Figure A5.5, to frame the remainder of the response to the event while ensuring the public and first responders are not exposed to unnecessary levels of radiation. A5.3.2.  The commander‘s main decision points during the response to an RED event will be to    determine  if  the  radiation  hazard  zone  was  or  was  not  contained  on  the  installation  and inform  the  appropriate  civil  authorities.    Also,  determine  if  critical  mission  operations  are affected by the event and make appropriate mission continuation decisions and direct use of appropriate OEGs. A5.3.3.  Figure  A5  6.,  provides  a  flow  diagram  for  commanders  to  use  as  a  guide  for responding to a RDD event.  The commander‘s main decision points during the response to a RDD event will be to: A5.3.3.1.  Determine  if  the  radioactive  contamination  was  contained  on  the  installation and inform the appropriate civil authorities if it was not. A5.3.3.2.  Determine  if  critical  mission  operations  are  affected  by  the  event  and  make appropriate mission continuation decisions. A5.3.3.3.  Determine the length of time it will take for the hazard cloud to pass and direct evacuation  actions  once  this  has  occurred  (goal  is  for  people  not  to  inhale  any  of  the radioactive  material  during  evacuation).    Alpha  emitters  such  as  Plutonium-238  present an  especially  dangerous  respiratory  hazard;  therefore,  personnel  should  shelter  or  don respiratory  protection  during  initial  cloud  settling  where  alpha  emitters  are  present  or suspected. A5.3.3.4.  Determine  and  direct  use  of  appropriate  public,  first  responder,  and  critical mission  operational  exposure  guidelines  (OEG)  to  ensure  radiation  exposure  is  kept ALARA. A5.3.4.  Figure A5  4., directs initial actions based on a measured dose rate.  Responders can determine where the measured dose rate (at the scene of the incident and/or at initial cordons) falls on the arrow to determine if the dose rate falls within the cold, warm, or hot zones.  For example, if the dose rate displayed on the screen of a dosimeter is within the range of 0.1-1.0 REM/hr,  then  response  personnel  located  in  the  warm  zone  should  take  the  appropriate measures  to  ensure  exposure  levels  remain  ALARA.    Further,  if  the    exposure  reading increases  responders can assume  they are getting closer to the source, whereas decreasing readings generally imply a greater distance away from the source; assuming shielding factors are not significantly impacting the dose reading.  Installations should determine the average background readings for inclusion using Figure  A5.4, Note:  background readings will vary from one installation to another and often within the installation itself. A5.3.4.1.  While  the  Department  of  Transportation  Emergency  Response  Guidebook (ERG)  is  the  national  standard  for  the  selection  of  isolation  and  protective  action distances associated with accidents involving CBRN materials,  it is  not  designed to  nor sufficiently  addresses  CBRN  hazard  footprints  resulting  from  an  intentional  terrorist release.   In  situations  involving  suspected  and/or  known  REDs  and  RDDs,  the  Incident Commander (IC) will be faced with  the choices between using the most likely or worst plausible scenarios as the foundational basis for cordon implementation.  Generally, it is recommended the IC use the most likely scenarios for both RED and RDD situations as their  initial  planning  factor.    For  the  most  likely  RED  scenarios,  the  ―small  spill‖ AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   239  evacuation  recommendation  (25  meters)  for  radioisotopes  provided  in  the  ERG  will generally be sufficient.  The majority of the most likely RDD packages will be contained within  the  ―large  spill‖  evacuation  distance  (100  meters).   In  all  cases,  responders  will need  to  begin  using  radiation  detectors  as  early  as  possible  and  adjust  the  cordon perimeter as required based upon ―ground truth‖ readings. A5.3.4.2.  The  IC  should  locate  the  dose  rate  number(s)  and  initial  evacuation  (or  the closest dose rate in Table  A5.2, by rounding the reported dose rate up.  For example, if the dose rate reported was 300 mrem/hr, then rounding up according to the next closest dose  rate  on  the  table  would  be  to  500  mrem/hr  on  the  following  table  to  determine  if additional  evacuation  is  necessary  for  the  public  and/or  responders.    If  the  dose  is  still above 20 mrem/hr for the public and/or above 1 rem/hr for responders (as in Table A5.3) at the cordons established, then the cordons should be expanded if possible.  According to this  table,  if  you  evacuated  the  public  to  75  feet  according  to  the  2008  ERG  Guide Number163 for the initial isolation and the actual dose rate reading is still 100 mrem/hr, then the  IC should  back  up the cordon by an additional 93 feet.   Since measurement  to this exact a distance is not necessarily feasible in the field,  approximately 100 feet may be more appropriate.  The dose rate should be taken again at that distance to confirm the dose rate is below 20 mrem/hr for the public.   Note: For emergency response functions we assume that R = RAD = REM. Figure A5.4.

These distances are suggested while awaiting arrival of Emergency Responders for more detailed analysis of the radiation contamination. A5.3.5.   Until EOD arrival and analysis, if a radiological threat exists, an unknown device should be considered an RDD.  The IC should consider expanding the current evacuation distance if the device is expected to be an RDD.  If the device is expected to contain radiological material there is a current radiological threat, the minimum evacuation distance may need to be expanded based upon the downwind hazard associated with the radiological source.  If the radiological source is unknown than the minimum evacuation distance should be expanded out to 2000 feet or the recommended distance provided in Figure A5.7, Radiological Device Evacuation Distances, whichever is greater.  However, if the radiological source of the suspect device is known then the minimum evacuation distance would be the greater of Table A5.2, RED Evacuation Distances for the Public, Table A5.3, RED Evacuation Distance for First Responders, and Figure A5.7, Radiological Device Evacuation Distances.  If it is known that the dispersal method of the RDD is by explosives than use the greater of the distances listed in Table A5.2, Table A5.3, Table A5.7, and Table A5.10., Recommended Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Minimum Evacuation Distance (MED). AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   243  Figure A5.7.  Radiological Device Evacuation Distances  A5.3.6.  Operational Exposure Guidelines (OEG).  The commander has the responsibility and authority to  set  radiation exposure limits,  referred to  as OEGs,  for personnel.   Table  A5.4., lists  the  recommended  OEGs  for  different  ―acceptable  risk  level‖  and  ―mission  criticality‖ combinations.  As mentioned earlier, the goal is to keep personnel exposures ALARA. A5.3.6.1.  Joint publications provide a definition (listed at the bottom of  Table  A5.4) of critical, priority, and routine missions.  No definition exists for the risk level categories of extremely  high,  high,  moderate,  and  low.    The  choice  of  which  risk  level  to  use  is  a subjective call that commanders will have to make. A5.3.6.2.  The  concept  behind  personnel  exposure  control  is  to  expose  the  minimum amount  of  people  to  the  minimum  amount  of  hazard  for  the  minimum  amount  of  time.  Commanders  should  ensure  that  people  have  very  focused  tasks  and  plans  of  attack before they are allowed to enter the hazard zone(s). intersect  of the  ICs  corresponding  assigned  ―mission  criticality‖  and A5.3.6.3.  The  predetermined  rem  total  dosage  is  determined  by  locating  the  answer  at the the corresponding assigned risk level in the ―commander-designated acceptable risk level‖ in Table  A5.4.    For  example,  the  table  shows  the  OEG  would  be  125  rem  if  the  mission criticality factor was ―critical‖ and the commanders acceptable risk level was ―extremely high.‖   244  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Table A5.4.

Table A5.5, is a quick reference tool for commanders  and  key  advisors  to  determine  how  long  it  will  take  to  reach  various radiation  doses  given  a  variety  of  dose  rates.    The  table  has  some  built-in  precepts  that commanders should be aware of: A5.3.6.4.1.  The ―total dose‖ figure equates to the OEG value that the commander or incident  commander (as appropriate) has selected for the mission.  See  Table  A5.4, regarding the selection of appropriate OEGs. A5.3.6.4.2.  The ―total dose‖ figure can equate to either the total allowable dose or to the  remaining  allowable  dose.    If  the  individuals  have  not  been  exposed  to  the radiation previously, the ―total dose‖ figure will equate to the commander-designated OEG.    If  someone  had  prior  exposure,  the  amount  of  prior  exposure  (15  rem  for instance) would need to be subtracted from the OEG (25 rem for example) to derive the total dose remaining (10 rem in this case). A5.3.6.4.3.  The  anticipated  dose  rate  in  the  area  where  the  individuals  will  be working  must  be  known.    EM  and  BE  personnel  can  provide  information  regarding this assessment. A5.3.6.4.4.  The values shown in the table are based on precise exposures to radiation of  the  same  intensity.    This  results  in  the  creation  of  a  small  safety  factor.    As opposed  to  being  exposed  to  an  equal  intensity  of  radiation  for  the  entire  exposure period,  people  will  enter  the  area  at  a  location  that  has  a  dose  rate  less  than  the predetermined OEG, travel no further than the area of the anticipated dose rate, and then return to the ECP or pre-established location– experiencing lesser dose rates the further out they go. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   245  A5.3.6.4.5.  People  entering  the  hazard  area  should  be  wearing  dosimeters  so  that precise  exposures  are  captured  regardless  of  the  varying  dose  rates.    The  use  of alarming dosimeters ensures individuals can be warned in the event they reach their total  allowable  dose  quicker  than  anticipated  and/or  encounter  a  dangerous  hot  spot (location where the radiation dose rate is  higher than anticipated).  Dosimeter alarm threshold/trigger settings will vary based on the Installation Commander‘s established acceptable  level  of  risk  once  a  radiological  incident  is  identified.    However,  it  is recommended  the  default  settings  of  each  dosimeter  be  initially  pre-set  to  alarm  at 0.001  cGy/hr  (0.01  millisievert/hr)  for  dose  rate  and  0.1  REM  for  total  dose  when first  issued  to  Security  Force  and  Fire  Protection/HAZMAT  personnel  at  a  time before  radioactive  sources  were  detected.    Alarm  values  can  then  be  reset  and/or increased accordingly as the situation warrants. A5.3.6.4.5.1.  Table  A5.5.    is  read  by  locating  the  answer  at  the  intersection  of  the appropriate ―total dose‖ column and ―dose rate‖ row.  For example, the table shows it will take 75 minutes for a person to reach the total dose of 125 rem if they were in an area with a dose rate of 100 rem/hr. Table A5.5.

Reference: Derived from ratio of respective dose rates to total doses. A5.3.7.  Installation  Detection  Capabilities.    It  is  imperative  that  installations  possess  a radiation  detection capability.   Detection  instruments  must be used in  this capacity because personnel will not be able to smell or see radioactive materials in the same manner they could sense chlorine, ammonia, or other hazardous chemicals.  Radiation detectors are used in the following general capacities: A5.3.7.1.  Detection of radioactive materials as they are attempted to be brought onto the installation. A5.3.7.2.  Accomplishment  of  radiation  surveys  in  order  to  identify  contaminated  areas and resources. A5.3.7.3.  Verification  of decontamination operations. the  effectiveness  of  contamination  avoidance  and A5.3.8.  In order to tailor the response to the maximum extent, it is important that response personnel  be  able  to  determine  what  specific  radioisotope  is  present,  but  immediately recognize  the  presence  of  the  overall  radiological  hazard.    Installations  will  be  able  to implement unique FPCON measures if intelligence agencies are able to provide any advance warning  of  a  terrorist  attack  involving  radioactive  materials.    The  implementation  of  these FPCON  measures  will  likely  direct  the  increased  use  of  radiological  detection  equipment; especially among the installation‘s first responder community.  This includes the positioning and use of dosimeters with audible dose and dose rate alarm functions within Security Force patrol  vehicles.    The  combined  effect  of  these  unique  FPCON  measures  is  an  increased chance  the  threat  will  be  identified  at  an  installation  access  gate  and/or  discovered  and contained in a timely manner.  For example, if a patrol vehicle's dosimeter alarms, the patrol would immediately notify the ECC of the situation.  The Security Forces representative in the ECC  would  subsequently  notify  the  appropriate  agency  (normally  the  Emergency Management  Flight  or  the  Bioenvironmental  Engineering  Flight  depending  on  the  structure of  the  installation).    These  personnel  will  then  transport  their  radiological  detectors  and support equipment to the site, check the dosimeter and receive a debriefing from the patrol, and then locate the radioactive source through the use of triangulation techniques.  It is also important that dosimeters are available for first responders, specialized teams and/or critical AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   247  mission  personnel  who  will  be  working  in  the  hazard  zone.    Dosimeters  track  the  gamma and/or neutron radiation dose that people receive.  The information obtained from dosimeters serves  as  the  cornerstone  for  the  personnel  exposure  control  program  that  will  be  put  into place in the aftermath of a terrorist attack involving radioactive materials. A5.3.8.1.  Installation  Protection  Program  (IPP)  provided  EPDs  shall  be  utilized  by  SF and  augmentees  for  first  line  radiological  detection  and  to  aid  in  personnel  risk management  response  operations.    Readiness  and  Emergency  Management  Flights through assigned contractor logistics support (CLS) will support employment of EPDs by coordinating  and  conducting  primary  planning,  reoccurring  training,  and  sustainment activities  as  required.    CLS  coordinates  with  BE  to  ensure  EPD  thresholds  are  set  for radiological detection employment (see paragraph A5.3.8.1.1.  ,  for  recommended  default  alarm  settings).    SF  and  Emergency Management  are  encouraged  to  utilize  the  Installation  Threat  Working  Group  or Antiterrorism Working Group to analyze installation specific radiological threats and establish base level employment of EPDs. A5.3.8.1.1.1.  Employment  options include each  SF patrol vehicle utilizing an  EPD-Mk2  for  detection  of  beta  and  gamma  radiation  during  routine  patrols,  or  at  a minimum  during  elevated  FPCONS  and/or  random  antiterrorism  measures.    Each installation gate should have at least one EPD-N2 for detection of gamma and neutron radiation  during  normal  operations  or  at  a  minimum  elevated  FPCONS  and/or random antiterrorism measures. A5.3.8.1.2.  Installations  receiving  EPDs  and/or  Radiation  Portal  Monitors  (RPMs) reserve installation level development for the tactical employment utilization options of  the  GR-135.    Redistribution  of  the  GR-135s  from  the  SF  to  the  Readiness  and Emergency  Management  Flight radioisotope identification  where  the  EPD  or  RPM  alarmed,  during  elevated  FPCONS  and/or random antiterrorism measures. recommended is for further A5.3.8.1.3.  BE  maintains  primary  responsibility  for  radioisotope  identification, however  during  elevated  FPCONs  and/or  random  antiterrorism  measures  the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight may be utilized to assist the BE with the radioisotope identification function. A5.3.8.2.  The  value  gained  by  possessing  radiological  detection  equipment  is  severely diminished  if  the  installation  does  not  effectively  allocate  and  distribute  in  a  timely manner the appropriate instruments to its responder community before an incident occurs.  EM  and  BE  personnel  should  identify  the  availability  and  distribution  of  radiological detectors  throughout  the  installation  which  could  include  fixed  detection  systems,  hand held  detectors,  and  alarming  dosimeters.    Further,  this  assessment  should  include radiological  detection  equipment  that  may  be  available  on  ―built-up‖  Unit  Type  Code (UTC) packages or stored in War Reserve Materiel (WRM) status.  This information will assist  in  the  establishment  of  a  desired  baseline  capability  and  resource  allocation structure.    In  cases  where  gaps  exist,  an  integrated  installation  detector  utilization  plan that  addresses  task  prioritization  and  equipment  cross-leveling  will  be  crucial  for applicable detection equipment alternatives.  See Table A8.2, for FPCON measures that trigger distribution of detection equipment).   248  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 A5.3.8.3.  Installation Commanders should also be aware that detection assets are likely to  be  available  through  local  civilian  response  organizations  and  accessible  through mutual  aid  or  other  support  agreements.    However,  consideration  should  be  given  that while these agencies may possess similar radiological detection capabilities, the specific type  of  equipment  used  and  their  capabilities  and  limitations  will  likely  vary.  Consequently,  the  base  emergency  responders  should  be  aware  of  the  specific  local detection capabilities so they can be used to effectively augment installation operations if required. A5.3.9.  Protection  Factor  (PF)  of  common  external  building  material  configurations.    The amount  of  protection  a  facility  provides  from  gamma  radiation  is  directly  related  to  the amount and type of material that make up the building‘s construction.  Generally, the denser or heavier the material, the better shielding it offers.  The degree of protection afforded by a shelter is expressed as its PF.  The use of the PF value enables planners to determine which installation  facilities  are  best  suited  for  providing  protection  in  the  aftermath  of  a  C-RW event.    Refer  to  the  Air  Force  Emergency  Management  CoP  for  a  PF  calculator  and instructions.  Figure A5.7, depicts a potential application of the results of PF calculation. Figure A5.8.  Example of Estimation of Protection Factor from Fallout  A5.3.9.1.  The  PF  simply  represents  the  fraction  of  the  available  radiation  dose  that penetrates  the  shelter  and  reaches  the  people  inside  compared  to  the  radiation  dose  that would  be  received  by  an  unprotected  person  outside.    A  PF  of  2  indicates  that  an individual  inside  the  shelter  is  expected  to  receive  only  one-half  of  the  radiation  doses they would receive if they were outside.  A PF of 100 indicates that the people inside the facility should receive only 1/100 or 1% of the radiation dose they would receive if they were outside. A5.3.9.2.  The  determination  of  a  building‘s  PF  involves  very  complex  calculations because  of  the  number  of  variables  involved  in  each  calculation:  the  potential radioisotope,  the  types  of  building  materials  ,  the  distance  from  the  shelter  area  to  the source(s) of radiation (which must be specifically measured). A5.3.9.3.  Table  A5  6.,  provides  representative  PFs,  with  an  accompanying  radiation reduction  (RR)  factor  (expressed  as  the  percent  by  which  the  total  available  radiation AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   249  dose will be reduced) for different common exterior building construction materials.  The Civil  Engineers  are  responsible  for  evaluating,  selecting  and  designating  installation facilities  as  shelters.    The  shelter  listing  should  be  contained  within  the  Civil  Engineer Contingency Response Plan. Table A5.6.

Tables A5.  7., and A5.8, are similar to Table A5.5, in that both are designed to assist commanders and key advisors determine when an individual is likely to receive a specified dose.  Tables A5.7, and A5.8, provide additional variables to the calculation. A5.3.9.4.1.  Tables  A5.  7.,  and  A5.8,  define  the  protective  factors  that  might  be involved.  This is very important when people may be working inside facilities.  The PF value of ―1‖ is used for people that have no shielding whatsoever. A5.3.9.4.2.  The  total  dose  values  associated  with  Table  A5.7,  refer  to  the  dose required to cause performance degradation (PD) in personnel.  Those individuals who are  predicted  to  be  ―performance  degraded‖  would  be  operating  at  a  performance level between 25 and 75 percent of their pre-exposure performance.  Those predicted as ―combat ineffective‖ should be considered as capable of performing their tasks at 25 percent (at best) of their pre-exposure performance level. A5.3.9.5.  Tables  A5.  7.,  and  A5.8,  provides  the  estimations  expressed  as  days,  hours and minutes.  Personnel are expected to reach the PD category after a cumulative dose of 125  rem  and  reach  the  combat  ineffective  (CI)  category  after  a  cumulative  dose  of  530 rem A5.3.9.5.1.  Table  A5  7.,  and  A5.8,  are  read  by  locating  the  answer  at  the intersection  of  the  appropriate  ―protection  factor‖  column  and  ―exposure  rate‖  row.  For  example,  the  table  shows  it  will  take  6  hours  for  a  person  to  reach  the  PD category if they were in a facility with a PF of 5,  and the outside dose rate was 100 rem/hr.   250  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Table A5.7.

These  were  correlated  with  the  locations  of  202  CONUS and 18 OCONUS AF installations.  In order to impact an installation, a storage site must be within  approximately  70  miles  according  to  the  Hazard  Prediction  and  Assessment Capability  (HPAC)  automated  plotting  program.    The  potential  hazard  plumes  range  in length  from  0.5  miles  to  70.5  miles  depending  on  weather  conditions  and  the  nature  of  the   252  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 incident.   The relative probability of either  a cladding failure or a zircaloy  fire occurring is low, but still possible. A5.3.10.1.  Tables  identifying  the  proximity  of  installations  to  nuclear  storage  facilities (CONUS and OCONUS) are posted on the Air Force Emergency Management CoP. A5.3.10.2.  Column Summary on Spreadsheet: A5.3.10.2.1.  Column 1.  Location of AF installation. A5.3.10.2.2.  Column 2.  Location of storage site. A5.3.10.2.3.  Column 3.  Distance between facility and site. A5.3.10.2.4.  Column 4.  Depiction of how many plumes could affect the installation (i.e.,  how  many  plumes  have  a  length  greater  than  the  distance  between  the installation  and  the  storage  site).    If  this  number  is  one  or  greater,  the  installation should consider the scenario in planning and exercises. A5.3.10.2.5.   Column 5.  Depiction of which (if any) of the potential plumes could affect the installation. A5.3.10.3.  The purpose of the spreadsheets is to identify which specific AF installations, including  Air  National  Guard  installations,  could  potentially  be  affected  by  incidents (natural  disasters,  accidents,  terrorist  attacks)  at  nuclear  storage  facilities.    Background regarding the values in the spreadsheet is as follows. A5.3.10.3.1.  Ground shine.  This is the residual radiation deposited when the hazard cloud has fully settled.  In all the scenarios studied, the plotted level of ground shine radiation is at or below normal background radiation readings. A5.3.10.3.2.  Acute  exposure  dose  levels.    These  plumes  depict  dosages  received during  the  passage  of  the  primary  hazard  cloud  within  a  short  time  period.    While there is no standard definition, short-term (commonly called ―acute‖) exposures occur within seconds to days.  In the case of these plumes, the exposure was for a 24-hour period.  Exposure includes cloud shine (gamma radiation from the passing cloud) and inhalation of aerosol particles.  When physical injury to the body cells occurs, these effects are known as deterministic (sometimes referred to as immediate effects). A5.3.10.3.3.  Stochastic  effects.    These  plumes  depict  dosages  received  by  the passage of the primary hazard cloud (24-hour exposure) at which health effects occur randomly  and  years  after  the  exposure,  and  for  which  the  probability  of  the  effect occurring is proportional to the dose received.  An example is an increase in the risk of cancer.  Exposure includes cloud shine and inhalation of aerosol particles. A5.3.10.3.4.  Different  hazard  effects  tables  are  used  for  the  acute  and  stochastic effects results.  Each table takes into account the particular physiological interaction of  the  radiation  with  the  different  body  organs  and  the  amount  of  time  before  the radiation  effects  are realized.  All  exposures are evaluated for both  acute immediate deterministic (operational) and delayed stochastic effects. A5.3.10.4.  Prevalent wind direction from each site was not factored in when determining which  installations  might  be  affected  by  these  incidents.    Rather,  the  study  used  a  360-AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   253  degree  methodology,  (i.e.,  any  installation  within  the  specified  distance(s)  from  the nuclear storage site was considered to be potentially affected.) A5.3.10.5.  Fuel  Cladding  Failure.    ―Cladding‖  refers  to  the  external  layer  of  zirconium alloy, or zircaloy, applied directly to a nuclear fuel or other material to provide protection from  a  chemically  reactive  environment,  containment  of  radioactive  products  produced during  the  irradiation  of  the  composite,  or  structural  support.    In  some  scenarios,  the cladding  material  may  be  cracked,  allowing  the  radiological  material  to  escape  into  the atmosphere.   This  represents  the first category of hazard listed in the spreadsheet  - fuel cladding  failure.    Virtually  all  US  spent  fuel  pools  have  been  ―re-racked‖  to  hold  more spent-fuel  assemblies  than  was  anticipated  in  the  original  power  plant  design.    The densities of these spent-fuel pools can approach those in nuclear reactor cores, increasing the likelihood of fuel cladding failure. A5.3.10.5.1.  Zircaloy Fire.  In other scenarios, especially those involving the loss of the  coolant  water  surrounding  spent-fuel  rods  that  were  recently  discharged  from reactors,  the  zircaloy  itself  may  overheat  and  catch  fire.    This  event  represents  the second category of hazard listed in the spreadsheet - zircaloy fire. A5.3.10.5.2.  For  the  purpose  of  this  analysis,  the  HPAC  values  used  were  for  fuel rods that had been discharged from the reactor two months previously. A5.3.10.5.3.  In  a  fire,  the  zircaloy  cladding  on  each  uranium  fuel  pellet  begins  to crack at 600 degrees Celsius (C), and combusts spontaneously above 900 degrees C.  Such temperatures could easily be reached in a fire following a large airplane crash.  For comparison, most media reports indicate that the 9/11 fires that brought down the Twin Towers reached temperatures in excess of 1,500 degrees C. A5.3.10.5.4.  While  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  estimates  the  likelihood  of an accident  leading to  a  critical  loss of water to  be very low—a chance  of less than one  in  100,000  per  pool  per  year—the  probability  of  the  zircaloy  fire  scenario resulting  from  a  terrorist  attack  is  unknown.    The  Board  on  Radioactive  Waste Management from the National Academies made the following statement in the 2006 Safety  and  Security  of  Commercial  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel  Storage:  Public  Report: ―FINDING  3B:  The  committee  finds  that,  under  some  conditions,  a  terrorist  attack that  partially  or  completely  drained  a  spent  fuel  pool  could  lead  to  a  propagating zirconium cladding fire and the release of large quantities of radioactive materials to the environment.‖ A5.3.10.5.5.  Many  radioactive  materials  could  potentially  be  released  into  the environment in the event of an inadvertent or terrorist-induced release of radioactive material  from  nuclear  storage  facilities.    HPAC  postulates  that  radioactive  materials from 12 separate groupings will be released. A5.3.10.6.  Nuclear  Storage  Incident  Operational  Considerations.   Two  general characteristics of radiation effects are useful for understanding the human effects of these scenarios:  onset  time  and  type  of  effects.    Onset  time  of  radiation  effects  following exposure is either immediate or delayed.  Immediate effects are often referred to as acute effects and occur within seconds to days.  Immediate effects include hemopoietic (blood related),  gastrointestinal,  and  central  nervous  system  syndromes.    These  effects  are  the   254  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 prime causes of incapacitation.  There are other immediate radiation  effects that are not considered in  this effort  since they  are  either  associated with  localized exposures or are not  incapacitating,  such  as  skin  burns,  hair  loss,  and  temporary  sterilization.    Delayed effects  of  radiation  exposure  may  appear  years  or  decades  later,  and  include  cancer, genetic effects, shortening of lifespan, and cataracts. A5.3.10.6.1.  Radiation effects can be classified as either deterministic or stochastic.  Deterministic effects result from the collective injury of substantial numbers of cells in  affected  tissues.    There  is  a  threshold  dose  level  below  which  the  effects  will probably not occur.  Above that threshold, the severity of the effect increases as the dose increases.  Deterministic effects were among the first observed biological effects of  ionizing  radiation,  and  include  cataract  of  the  lens,  non-malignant  damage  to  the skin,  cell  depletion  in  the  bone  marrow,  and  gonadal  cell  damage  leading  to impairment of fertility.  Deterministic effects may also be associated with damage to blood vessel or connective tissue elements. A5.3.10.6.2.  Stochastic  effects  occur  randomly,  and  the  probability  of  the  effect occurring, rather than its severity, is assumed to be a linear function of dose without any lower threshold.  Stochastic effects can result from injury to a single cell or small number  of  cells,  and  the  principal  consequences  are  considered  to  be  heritable (genetic) and carcinogenic (cancer) effects. A5.3.10.6.3.  A single radiation exposure can lead to both deterministic and stochastic effects.    Each  type  of  effect  must  be  considered  separately.    To  make  things  even more confusing, each type of effect is computed differently (from the same exposure) and sometimes reported using different units of measurement.  (The use of different exposure units for deterministic and stochastic effects ensures that the correct effects tables are used.) A5.3.10.6.4.  The exposure from a release of nuclear materials is associated with the passage of the hazard  cloud.   The  cloud  passage time depends on how long it takes the cloud to reach a particular downwind point.  Cloud passage time is roughly one-third  of  the  cloud  travel  time.    If  it  takes  a  cloud  60  minutes  to  reach  a  particular location, it will take 20 minutes for the cloud to pass over that location. A5.3.10.6.5.  While the cloud passes over a location, some of the radioactive material is  deposited  on  the  ground.    This  is  called  dry  deposition.    The  deposited  material emits gamma radiation, which is called ground shine.  The ground shine intensity is represented  as  a  dose  rate  and  is  used  to  determine  the  residual  hazard  to  personnel occupying  the  contaminated  area.    While  the  cloud  passes  a  location,  personnel  are exposed to the gamma radiation (cloud shine).  Some of the particulate matter in the cloud is inhaled and retained in the body.  This inhaled material is initially deposited in  the  lung  but  can  be  transported  to  other  organs,  resulting  in  a  complex  internal exposure  that  contains  alpha,  beta,  and  gamma  emitters  with  a  wide  range  of  decay rates. A5.3.10.6.6.  The  acute  effects  output  accounts  for  this  type  of  internal  exposure  by considering  the  immediate,  deterministic  radiation  effects.    These  data  are  used  to estimate the distance at which radiation exposures are intense enough to cause short-term  severe effects  that could  affect  operations.  Stochastic effects  include the same AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   255  type  of  exposure  discussed  above  (cloud  shine  and  inhaled  material),  but  the  output levels  consider  the  delayed  stochastic  effects  of  radiation  exposure,  such  as  cancer, which  can  occur  decades  after  the  exposure  event.    These  effects  will  not  cause immediate  operational  effects,  but  a  commander  will  want  to  consider  them  in  any risk management evaluation. A5.3.11.  Fallout plotting for INDs will be accomplished in the same  manner as for tactical nuclear  weapons  i.e.,  manual  accomplishment  of  simplified  and/or  detailed  plotting,  and/or automated plotting through the use of the Joint Effects Model (JEM).  See AFTTP 3-2.56, for additional detail  regarding nuclear fallout  plotting.  However, in  regards to determining the likely  unshielded  dose  rate  and/or  dose  at  specified  distances  from  1  KT  and  10  KT detonations, personnel  should  use the information  in  Table 3.9. and/or the "initial  dose rate and  doses"  charts  available  on  the  AFCESA  Emergency  Management  portal.    These  charts provide precise exposure projections; thereby enabling specific calculations to be performed that cannot be performed based solely on the definitions associated with Zone I and Zone II from  the manual  simplified and detailed fallout  plotting methods.

The Air Force must sustain the capability to render safe or dispose of unexploded ordnance (UXO) and IEDs  delivered  or  placed  by  enemy  forces  and  US  and  allied  ordnance  made  dangerous  by accident  or  other  circumstance.    EOD-qualified  military  members  are  the  designated  and authorized  personnel  within  the  Air  Force  who  are  trained  and  equipped  to  analyze  and  defeat the  threats  caused  by  hazardous  EO,  criminal/terrorist  IEDs,  and  WMDs.    Air  Force  EOD mission is  to protect people, resources, and the environment from the dangerous effects of these hazardous by locating, identifying, evaluating, rendering safe, disposing, and gathering evidence for  profiling  terrorists.    EOD  provides  full-spectrum  response  capability  to  CBRNE  WMD devices, incendiary, conventional explosive ordnance and IEDs.   256  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 A5.4.1.  There are times when an emergency response to a military weapon or IED does not require  the  formation  of  the  installations  Disaster  Response  Force  (DRF).    The  actions required  by  the  EOD  team  may  take  far  less  time  to  alleviate  the  hazard  and  return  the installations operations back to its normal posture than what it would take to deploy the DRF.  Additionally, the suspect device may only impact a very small area that only affects a minor part of the current operations with no impact to the installations overall mission.  It may be after  EOD  conducts  their  initial  reconnaissance  of  the  suspect  device  before  the  DRF  is activated. A5.4.2.  The  best  method  of  protecting  the  public  and  all  emergency  responders  during incidents involving UXO, IEDs, and CBRNE WMD is to establish a safe distance from the device  that  will  protect  against  blast  overpressure  and  fragmentation  associated  with  an intentional or unintentional detonation of these devices.  Establishment of the initial cordon is based upon the minimum evacuation distance (MED) associated with the specific weapon or the overall size of a suspected device or IED. A5.4.3.  The  distances  provided  in  Figure  A5.10,  Recommended  Improvised  Explosive Device  (IED)  Minimum  Evacuation  Distance  (MED),  provides  AF  first  and  emergency responders with the standard MED to use when establishing the initial and adjusted cordon.  Generally,  the  cordon  will  only  be  adjusted  (expanded  or  decreased)  after  EOD  has completed an initial reconnaissance of the device and provided the IC with a recommended evacuation distance. A5.4.4.  The  calculations  provided  in  Figure  A5.10,  are  in  compliance  with  Department  of Defense  (DOD)  Standard  6055.9-STD,  DOD  Explosive  Safety  Board  Technical  Paper  16, Methodologies  for  Calculating  Primary  Fragment  Characteristics,  AF  Instruction  91-201, and  EOD  specific  60  series  publications.    Approval  documentation  is  archived  at AFCESA/CEXD,  DSN  523-6433.    The  use  of  any  secondary  agency  MED  chart  for explosive devices is prohibited due to the inconsistency of the mathematical methods utilized to  determine  their  evacuation  distances  that  in  most  cases  recommend  much  smaller  safety footprints.    Existing  MED  charts  include  Alcohol,  Tobacco,  and  Firearms  Vehicle  Bomb Explosion  Hazard  and  Evacuation  Distance  Tables,  National  Counterterrorism  Center (NCTC)  Bomb  Threat  Stand-off  Distances,  National  Ground  Intelligence  Center  (NGIC) Improvised  Explosive  Device  (IED)  Safe  Standoff  Distance  Cheat  Sheet,  Technical  Support Working Group (TSWG) Bomb Threat Standoff Card. A5.4.5.  Utilize the four columns in the recommended IED MED chart in Figure  A5.10  To determine  the  MED  use  column  1  and  select  the  container  size/type  comparison  for  the suspected  device  and  correlate  your  distance  based  upon  columns  2  through  4.    The  chart provides 5 notes which must be noted and implemented to ensure the maximum protection of all personnel. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   257  Figure A5.10.

The threat or use of CBRN weapons represents one of the most difficult challenges facing our  nation  and  our  Air  Force.    There  are  a  multitude  of  possibilities  in  regards  to  CBRNE weapon systems and agents/materials.  For example, while the AF may understand that a TBM may  carry  submunitions,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  installation  would  know  the  ―spread  factor‖ associated with the package which could range from less than 100 meters to approximately 1000 meters.  An example from a potential terrorist attack would be that an installation might receive intelligence that a particular group was making plans to detonate a radiological dispersal device (RDD)  in  the  local  area.    However,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  intelligence  information  will  specify exactly what radioisotope(s) will be involved, what amount of the radioisotope(s) will be present, and what type and amount of explosive will be used.  In both the TBM and RDD examples, the absence  of  this  information  means  that  the  appropriate  Emergency  Support  Function  (ESF) representatives  will  not  be  able  to  generate  accurate  pre-attack  projections  of  the  extent  and intensity of the residual hazard area.  While other CBRNE attack configurations are possible, and different  weather  conditions  will  generate  other  results,  the  following  tables  and  figures  depict representative  hazard  profiles  (approximations)  based  on  climatological  winds  with  zonally averaged west-to-east flow that should be used to assist installations in their planning, training, and  exercise  processes  but  not  for  real-world  events.    These  hazard  profiles  shown  in  Table A6.1,  are  drawn  from  agreed  upon  sources  such  as  the  National  Planning  Scenarios  and  are realistic portrayals of the most likely and worst plausible attack scenarios.  For real-world events, CBRN Control Centers should run fresh model plumes using DOD-approved current surface and upper-level  wind  directions  and  speeds  at  the  location  and  time  the  event  occurs  as  well  as forecast winds downstream from the event. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   259   Table A6.1.

Radiological weapons are not expected to have a severe, earth-shattering impact.  Keep in mind  that  radiological  and  nuclear  weapons  are  not  the  same.    The  level  of  risk  to  installation personnel  from  possible  contamination  of  food  and  water  sources  is  low.    The  probability  of  a large  number  of  casualties  suffering  from  the  effects  of  exposure  to  ionizing  radiation  via  the ingestion pathway is low due to the large amounts of radioactive material that would be needed to  achieve  sufficient  high  concentrations  of  radioactivity  after  dilution.    Public  perception  and fear will most probably be the largest issue associated with this type of threat.  The tables in this section  are  representative  graphical  samples,  depicting  likely  but  not  all-inclusive  irregular radiological attack scenarios. A6.5.1.  Unlike  the  damage  and  high  intensity  fields  of  radiation  associated  with  INDs,  the impact of RDDs on critical missions and human health is expected to be easily manageable.  Although  each  situation  will  potentially  be  different,  representative  analysis  of  critical mission  operations  following  RDD  incidents  showed  that  if  commanders  are  willing  to accept an increased health risk from radiological exposure over normal peacetime standards, there is  not  a physical  reason critical  missions can't  be continued for at  least  72 hours after   278  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 the attack.  Because of the relatively small dose rates people would be exposed to outside of the  immediate  area  surrounding  the  release  point  for  an  RDD,  personnel  doses  associated with  the  conduct  of  critical  missions  will  not  result  in  immediate  incapacitation  and/or  life threatening situations.  The largest projected doses won't result in short term symptoms but do represent a 2% to 6% increased risk of lifetime fatal cancer.  See AFTTP 3-2.56, for the definitions  associated  with  people  who  are  considered  to  be  combat  effective,  performance degraded, or combat ineffective. A6.5.2.  REDs  are  unlikely  to  affect  critical  mission  operations  unless  very  specific populations  such as pilots,  UAV  operators, or satellite control specialists are targeted.  The key  to  defense  against  a  RED  is  discovery  of  the  source.    The  timeline  for  the  onset  of symptoms depends on the strength of the source, cumulative length of exposure, proximity of the individual to the source, and protection factor of the items/building materials between the source  and  the  people.    Even  if  the  source  is  not  discovered  right  away,  the  onset  of symptoms will occur before the person is incapacitated. Table A6.11.

A6.5.3.  INDs  can  rapidly  bring  about  the    termination  or  transfer  of  critical  missions  (to organizations outside the affected area) because of the high intensity of gamma radiation in portions  of  the  hazard  cloud.    The  radiological  dose  rates  from  an  IND  are  primarily determined  by  how  far  the  installation  is  from  the  detonation  point  and  the  yield  of  the weapon.  Table A6.12, provides representative dose rates for 1 KT and 10 KT ground burst weapons as a function of distance from the IND detonation point. Table A6.12.

RadPro Calculator (http://www.radprocalculator.com/) is an online tool that may be used for quickly converting radiological unit and/or planning when advanced notice of a AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   279  specific radiological point source is received.  For example, if a known quantity of a gamma source  is  stolen,  the  specific  isotope  and  size  can  be  input  into  the  calculator  to  determine how far the radiation would be detectable with and without shielding. A6.5.5.  Some types of radioisotope packages can create problems for the adversaries wherein high levels of unshielded radiation emanating from the device would incapacitate and kill the adversaries prior to them being able to use the source for its intended purpose (i.e., component of a RDD for instance).  The amount of shielding that terrorists would need during the handling and transport phases of their attack depends in part on their objective and the number of adversaries (e.g., alternating shifts to minimize total exposure) available to help carry out the mission.

It  is  important  to  note  that  commanders  should  ask  (through  normal  higher headquarters  channels)  for  the  capability  they  require,  and  not  ask  for  a  specific  team  or compilation of specialized resources.

The  attacks  that  occurred  on  11  September  2001  clearly  demonstrated  that  the  United States  is  no longer  a  sanctuary.    While  the  terrorists  chose  the  Pentagon  because  it  symbolizes America‘s  predominant  military  influence,  any  number  of  military  installations  around  the country  could  have  been  attacked.    AF  installations  must  safeguard  their  personnel,  equipment and  infrastructure  to  include  high  value  targets.    Due  to  the  proliferation  of  knowledge, technology, and materiel, terrorists are no longer limited to high yield explosives as they are now able  to  employ  chemical,  biological,  radiological,  and  possibly  nuclear  weapons  against  both civilian  and  military  targets  in  the  United  States and  abroad.    To  protect  personnel  and  critical infrastructure  from  the  effects  of  terrorist  use  of  CBRNE  materials  the  AF  uses  the  CBRN measures listed in Table A8.2  to supplement current FPCON measures when a credible CBRN threat exist. A8.2.  CBRN  FP  Measures.    CBRN  measures  require  a  collaborative,  integrated,  cross-functional effort between first and emergency responders to include, Civil Engineers, Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams, Fire Emergency Services, Emergency Management, Security Forces, Medical  Services,  Bioenvironmental  Engineers,  Public  Health  Emergency  Officer, Communications, Intelligence, and Counterintelligence communities.  All play key roles in force protection.    In  the  future  these  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  AFI  10-245,  as  added measures to counter the threat of terrorist attacks with CBRN materials.  When installations have a threat of terrorist using CBRN materials these measures will be used along with FPCONs. A8.3.  The FPCON system (Table A8.1.) is a DOD program standardizing the military services‘ identification  of,  and  recommended  responses  to  terrorist  threats  including  the  use  of  CBRNE materials against United States personnel and facilities.  CBRN FPCON measures are defined in Table A8.2  The FPCON system is the principle means for a commander to apply an operational decision  on  how  to  protect  against  terrorism.    It  also  facilitates  inter-Service  coordination  and support for antiterrorism.  Commanders that have jurisdiction or control over threatened facilities or personnel  declare the appropriate level  of response.  FPCONs describe progressive levels  of terrorist threats and initiate pre-planned defensive or mitigation actions.  FPCON declarations are normally  provided  through  the  chain-of-command,  base  public  address  system  announcements, and other available base media.  The minimum measures required for FPCON levels are found in AFI 10-245, as well as theater and local guidance.   290  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011  Table A8.1.  Force Protection Condition (FPCON) System FPCON NORMAL  Applies when a general global threat of Application Considerations Warrants a routine security posture. ALPHA BRAVO possible terrorist activity exists. Applies when there is an increased general threat of possible terrorist activity against personnel or facilities, the nature and extent of which are unpredictable. Applies when an increased or more predictable threat of terrorist activity exists. CHARLIE  Applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely. Applies in the immediate area where a terrorist attack has occurred or when intelligence has been received that terrorist action against a specific location or person is imminent. DELTA  ALPHA measures must be capable of being maintained indefinitely. Sustaining BRAVO measures for a prolonged period may affect operational capability and relations with local authorities. Implementation of CHARLIE measures will create hardship and affect the activities of the unit and its personnel. Normally, this FPCON is declared as a localized condition.  FPCON DELTA Measures are not intended to be sustained for substantial periods. AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   291   Table A8.2.  CBRN Force Protection Measures NUMBER  MEASURE There are no specific CBRN measures for FPCON NORMAL  Establish/review plan for all hand-held CBRN detectors (deployment and home station assets) that will be used at home station during periods of increased threat for terrorist use of CBRN materials. Develop and exercise (tabletop and/or field exercise) a CBRN detection plan using available detectors. Review SIP and evacuation plans for all facilities on base or controlled by USAF personnel/units. Brief installation leadership if manning or capabilities do not allow for specialized teams as outlined in AFI 10-2501 (shelter management team, contamination control area, emergency management support team, etc.).    Review Joint Service Installation Vulnerability Assessment (JSIVA), Service, and local vulnerability assessment reports.  Identify specific CBRN-related operational shortfalls in planning documents and brief to installation leadership. Have intelligence and OSI personnel provide a CBRN threat briefing to the Threat Working Group (TWG) or equivalent.  Include specific information such as: Probability of CBRN material use against installation or local community. Type(s) and amounts of CBRN materials that may be used. CBRN materials release mechanism(s), e.g., explosive release of toxic industrial material from tanker truck, use of biological materials through pesticide sprayer, etc. Probable targets and intent of CBRN release. Verify the interoperability of CBRN response procedures with local community resources.  In addition, coordinate response capabilities with local responders. Establish/review process for getting key installation personnel (leadership, first responders, emergency responders, and specialized team members) and mutual aid resources onto the installation to assist with CBRN response/recovery efforts during FPCON DELTA. Ensure the information in the DCP and MCRP has been coordinated with off-base medical treatment facilities to ensure procedures have been developed for these facilities to handle contaminated casualties. Review procedures for re-supply of critical CBRN response supplies/equipment, and establish who can provide the re-supply and the time frame.

As applicable, assess CBRN detection and identification capabilities.  Verify stockpiles and review detection arrays and collection schedules for maximum effect. As appropriate to the threat or when directed, develop a plan to issue CBRN Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) to first and emergency responders. Review DCP and MCRP to ensure consideration is given to mass issuance of CBRN pre-treatment medications, nerve agent antidotes, biological prophylaxis and/or antibiotics. Ensure the medical surveillance system as outlined in the MCRP includes triggers/criteria for personnel exposure to CBRN material. Ensure updates from local medical care providers are automatically received through the medical surveillance system.  Contact local hospitals and establish lines of communication for notification of the installation in the event of significant increase in antibiotic use or people exhibiting symptoms of exposure to CBRN materials. Secure and inspect base water supply and food storage facilities.  If a CBRN threat exists, ensure all shortages of CBRN equipment and potential impact is briefed to the installation commander. If a CBRN threat exists, verify operation, deploy, and begin using all available CBRN detectors (deployment and home station resources) as outlined in the detection plan. Ensure available collective protection (COLPRO) facilities are operational. If a CBRN threat exists, consider routing all traffic through installation access gates that have RPM or other CBRN detectors installed/available. If a CBRN threat exists, consider the use of hand-held detectors to check for the presence of radioactive materials and chemical hazards at installation access gates. Consider increased AT/FP measures such as conducting random monitoring with radiological detection devices of vehicles with installation access stickers at installation access gates that do not possess RPMs. If a potential biological threat exists, consider the usefulness and feasibility of increasing the sampling rate of available biological detection systems. Consider placing mobile biological detection systems (if available) such as SpinCons at key installation facilities (C2, critical mission) Ensure all personnel with IPE are briefed to have it available at all times (work, living quarters, and during transit). Ensure flow of information between on and off-base medical treatment facilities participating in the medical surveillance program.  Consider initiation of manual collection of data if the automated AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   293     CHARLIE    DELTA   11 12 13   14  15  16  17 18 19 20  21 22  1 2 3 system has a 24-hour or more delay in providing results. If a CBRN threat exists, consider placing the installation Disaster Response Force (DRF) into 24-hour operations.  If not feasible, consider placing key DRF personnel on standby. If a CBRN threat exists, consider activation of specialized team members, and place them on standby. Ensure that DRF, and if permissible, local authorities are briefed on potential CBRN threat. If the Homeland Security Advisory System is Orange (High) or Red (Severe), determine (through MAJCOM and AF) if a Principal Federal Official (PFO) has been designated and an Emergency Response Team (ERT) is in the process of establishing a Joint Field Office (JFO).  As appropriate, make contact and begin coordination for influx of forces and equipment as necessary. Accomplish CBRN contamination avoidance measures to the maximum extent possible IAW CEMP 10-2 and the Civil Engineer Contingency Response Plan (CRP) Distribute instructions for individual response to CBRN incidents to the base populace through existing channels.  Have facility managers ensure facility staff understands emergency actions to take in the event of a CBRN attack. Validate that all CBRN warning, notification, and reporting channels are operational, and that all parties know what announcements will be made and what reporting protocol (for terrorist use of CBRN materials) will be followed. Increase medical surveillance activities and consider beginning vector surveillance. Increase monitoring of food and water sources, both on and off base. If a CBRN threat exists, consider suspending/closing all non-mission essential group gatherings. If a CBRN threat exists, consider enhanced disease prevention as outlined in the DCP and MCRP – increased emphasis on hygiene, and sectoring medical treatment facility for medical provider protection. If a credible CBRN threat exists, initiate issuance of CBRN pre-treatment supplies, biological prophylaxis, and nerve agent antidotes to the installation population if appropriate.    Take appropriate action to complete all previous CBRN measures not already accomplished. Initiate enhanced medical surveillance procedures; include triage outside the medical treatment facility. If not already accomplished and a credible threat exists, initiate collective protection operations, if installed.   294  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 Attachment 9 CONTAMINATION CONTROL AREA (CCA) PROCEDURES A9.1.  CCA  Supervisor  and  Attendant  Guidelines.  The following information is provided to help  the  CCA  supervisor  and  attendants  perform  their  duties.    It  is  designed  to  cover  the overarching  concepts  of  the  CCA  and  not  specific  equipment.    This  information  is  especially important  to  the  CCA  attendants  if  they  were  not  pre-designated  and  trained.    It  may  be necessary for one person to perform multiple tasks in more than one area and it may be possible to  divide  the  tasks  in  a  single  area  between  several  people.    You  may  have  to  modify  the information  to  add  CCA-specific  designs,  equipment,  supplies,  and  available  manpower  to  fit your  mission  needs.    If  staffing  allows,  it  is  a  good  idea  to  have  an  attendant  located  in  the holding  area  who  can  answer  questions  concerning  the  procedures  and  direct  people  to  the appropriate  processing  line,  thereby  increasing  the  flow  of  personnel  and  minimizing  bottle necks.  Regardless of staffing levels, clearly printed signs will be placed throughout the CCA to inform personnel of requirements or emphasize verbal instructions being provided.  Utilize Table A9.1., for the CCA Supervisor‘s and Table A9.2., for the CCA Attendant‘s Actions. Table A9.1.  CCA Supervisor’s Actions CCA SUPERVISOR’S ACTIONS 1.  Supervise attendants.      a.

Identify and provide CCA capability for in-place and deployed Air Force personnel as required by theater or MAJCOM guidance. A9.3.2.  If theater or MAJCOM guidance is not provided, plan to process at least 20percent of the airbase population during a 24-hour period.  Include additional capability, if required, for transient aircrew and passengers. A9.3.3.  CCA planning factors: A9.3.3.1.  Determine  the  agent‘s  expected  persistency  time.    This  determination  will result in one of two scenarios:  the agent will remain in the area for a period of time that will  require  a  percentage  of  the  base  population  to  process  one  or  more  times,  or  the persistency  of  the  agent  is  such  that  only  those  people  whose  CPO  was  physically contaminated will require CCA processing. A9.3.3.2.  Use  all  available  variables  (mission  requirements,  weather,  physical  and mental  condition  of  base  populace,  transportation  capabilities,  etc.)  to  determine  the amount of time leadership realistically believes each person should spend on shift and use this  information  to  determine  when  the  CCA  should  be  established.    For  example,  if personnel  are  on  a  12  hour  shift  then  planners  will  need  to  back  up  that  time  based  on AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011   309  how long it will take to set up, provide supplies and process personnel through the CCA.  Planners should use the below actions to determine when CCA set-up should begin and how many are required. A9.3.3.3.  Determine the amount of time it will take to establish the CCA/TFA complex.  If it is  not  already  established, use a figure of two hours.  Planners should also  use this time to allow equipment and CPOs to weather.  This weathering will greatly reduce the contact  hazard  people  bring  with  them  to  the  CCA,  thereby  reducing  the  potential  for casualties caused by cross contamination. A9.3.3.4.  Assess  the  number  of  people  who  would  be  expected  to  be  caught  outside without  overhead cover in the event of an attack.  The adequacies of the INWS coupled with  the  base  populace‘s  competency  are  the  main  factors.    Add  a  safety  factor (recommend  5  percent).    For  example,  if  you  believed  10  percent  of  the  base  populace would be caught outside, then use 15 percent as your figure for this step. A9.3.3.5.  Assess  the  number  of  people,  over  and  above  the  personnel  thought  to  be contaminated in  the last step, who will contaminate their CPO  (don‘t  count  gloves and overboots),  during  mission  operations.    For  example,  if  15  percent  of  personnel  are believed  to  be  contaminated  then  add  another  5  percent  for  those  that  could  be contaminated  removing  covers,  moving  equipment  or  conducting  mission  operations.  This would bring up the percentage of base personnel that are required to process through the CCA to 20 percent. A9.3.3.6.  Using  the  steps  and  examples  above  planners  would  use  these  figures  to determine  the  number  of  CCAs  required.    Planners  will  look  at  the  time  of  attack  and how  long  it  takes  to  set  up  CCA(s)  based  on  when  personnel  will  come  off  shift.    If personnel are on a 12 hour shift and they worked 4 hours prior to an attack.  They would have 8 hours left on their shift.  Planners will subtract 2 hours (time to set up CCA) from 8 hours which equals 6 hours. A9.3.3.6.1.  Divide  the  required  number  of  people  (Base  populace  of  8000  X.20 percent  contaminated  =  1,600  personnel  that  would  require  to  process  through  the CCA) into the amount of personnel  that can process  through the CCA (70).   In this example,  1,600  personnel  divided  into  70  =  22  hours  to  process  1,600  personnel through one CCA.  In order to process 1,600 personnel within the 6 hour time frame (6 divided into 22) 4 CCAs are required. A9.3.3.6.2.  To  shorten  that  timeline  additional  CCAs  are  required.    In  addition, planners will have to set up schedules when personnel will process through the CCA based on time on shift and mission criticality. A9.3.3.7.  Reduce the CCA processing requirements by the number of personnel that will use Class I through IV collective protection CCA. A9.3.3.8.  Where  feasible,  include  procedures  to  rapidly  process  minimally  injured (ambulatory)  personnel  through  non-medical  CCA.    This  speeds  access  to  medical treatment and reduces the burden upon medical decontamination teams. A9.3.3.9.  For planning, assume the CCA will operate two twelve-hour shifts and provide the capability to process at least 10 percent of the airbase population per shift.   310  AFMAN10-2503  6 JULY 2011 A9.3.3.10.  Consider  adding  additional  capability  to  account  for  system  attritions  and CCA  surge  processing  capability.    Plan  to  sustain  this  capability  for  up  to  96  hours (continuous or 12-hour segments) within a 30-day period. A9.4.  Amplifications. A9.4.1.  If  an locations simultaneously, either open-air or in conjunction with collective protection facilities, the total required processing lines can be distributed between the various locations. is  capable  of  operating  multiple  CCA/TFA installation A9.4.2.  In  the  case  where  people  contaminated  only  their  gloves  and/or  overboots,  these items can be decontaminated and disposed of in the following manner: A9.4.2.1.  Decontaminate gloves and overboots in a liquid solution containing 5 percent chlorine (straight bleach or suitable slurry). A9.4.2.2.  Remove overboots and discard into plastic bags (which will be transported to the contaminated waste disposal area). A9.4.2.3.  Remove gloves in typical ―both at same time‖ manner and discard into plastic bags (which will be transported to the contaminated waste disposal area).
