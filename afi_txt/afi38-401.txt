Continuous  Process  Improvement  (CPI)  increases  operational  capabilities  while  reducing associated costs by applying proven techniques to all processes associated with fulfilling the Air Force  (AF)  mission.    The  goal  of  Air  Force  CPI  is  to  eliminate  waste  while  maximizing customer  value.   Air  Force  CPI  uses  several  widely  accepted  process  improvement methodologies,  including  lean,  six  sigma,  theory  of  constraints,  and  business  process reengineering.    Key  principles  contained  in  these  methodologies  include  improving  flow  and reducing  waste  within  a  process,  focusing  on  factors  that  degrade  product  quality,  identifying and  overcoming  process  constraints,  and  redesigning  processes.    The  application  of  these principles  enables  Airmen  to  integrate  continuous  improvement  into  day-to-day  operations across the full spectrum of AF operations.   4 AFI38-401  15 APRIL 2016 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  2.1.

Practical Problem Solving Method (PPSM) (formerly known as the 8-Step).  3.1.1. This training cultivates a standard, innovative, critical thinking culture to improve the way we work.   Solving day-to-day work area problems, regardless of organizational level, goes to the heart of CPI efforts.  This problem-solving method serves as the framework for the application of all CPI approaches, methodologies, tools, and techniques available to the practitioner.  Practical Problem Solving Method training is provided during accession and PME courses.  It can also be provided by a trained GB practitioner, using the curriculum posted on the AF CPI portal.  3.2.  Just-in-Time Training.  3.2.1.  Team  members  receive  training  when  they  participate  in  a  CPI  project.    The practitioner determines what type of training is needed by the team and when to provide it.  3.3.  Green Belt (GB) Training.  3.3.1.  Green Belt training is the initial level of CPI training for a practitioner.  It introduces CPI methodologies, tools, problem solving, and facilitation.  Green Belt training is provided via two sources:  1) the Manpower and Organization Apprentice Course, or 2) a certified BB practitioner who is also current.  (Note: a practitioner who has attended BB training, but has not  received  BB  certification  may  be  authorized  to  provide  GB  training  upon  MPO approval).  Practitioners delivering GB training use the standard curriculum posted on the AF CPI portal.  Use of the SAF/MGM-approved curriculum is mandatory.  (T-1)  3.3.2.  After  successful  completion  of  GB  training,  civilian  employees  can  update  their civilian training record in the Defense Civilian Personnel  Data System (DCPDS) according to published procedures.  3.4.  Black Belt (BB) Training.  3.4.1.  Black  Belt  training  is  the  intermediate  level  of  CPI  training  for  a  practitioner.    It  is designed  to  increase  knowledge,  skills,  and  abilities  using  CPI  tools,  as  well  as  further develop  facilitation and  problem  solving techniques.  The  course is  delivered by AU’s CPI E&T  at  Maxwell  AFB,  AL.    Practitioners  must  be  nominated  to  attend  the  course.    (T-1)  Nomination requirements are provided in Attachment 2.  3.4.2.  The  MPO  submits  the  practitioner’s  BB  training  nomination  package  to  CPI  E&T.  Continuous  Process  Improvement  E&T  recommends  nominees  to  SAF/MGM  for  final approval.  3.4.3.  Continuous Process Improvement E&T instructors will update those who successfully complete the BB training in AF CPI portal.  (T-1)  3.4.4.  After  successful  completion  of  BB  training,  civilian  employees  can  update  their training record in the DCPDS according to accepted procedures.  3.5.  Master Black Belt (MBB) Training.  10 AFI38-401  15 APRIL 2016 3.5.1.  Master  Black  Belt  training  is  the  most  advanced  level  of  CPI  training  for  a practitioner.    It  is  designed  to  further  develop  and  increase  knowledge,  skills,  and  abilities using CPI tools, as well as further develop facilitation and problem solving techniques.    3.5.2.  This  training  is  currently  not  provided  by  the  AF.    Master  Black  Belt  training  is personal  professional  development  the  AF  encourages,  but  is  not  currently  an  AF requirement.    3.6.  Senior Leader Education.  3.6.1.  The  SLC  provides  senior  leaders  with  an  overview  of  how  CPI  is  used  to  define problems; measure, manage, and monitor performance; and strategically align organizational goals,  objectives, and project  selection.  The course introduces leaders to  CPI concepts  and uses an industry tour to provide first-hand exposure to CPI mindset and tools.  Colonels, GS-15s  (or  equivalent),  Chief  Master  Sergeants,  and  squadron  commanders  should  attend  the SLC.        This  course  is  hosted  by  the  MPO  or  WPM  and  is  scheduled  with  CPI  E&T,  who coordinates  the  instructor  and  provides  any  course  materials.    Continuous  Process Improvement E&T provides instructors for the SLC, whether through physically assigned or “adjunct” instructors.  3.6.1.1.  Procedures for scheduling and supporting a SLC are found on the AF CPI portal.  3.6.1.2.  After  successful  completion  of  the  SLC,  civilian  employees  can  update  their civilian training record in the DCPDS according to accepted procedures.  3.7.  Executive Leader Education.  3.7.1.  The  Executive  Leader  Course  provides  executive  leaders  with  a  basic  understanding of key CPI principles to improve and expand the implementation  of CPI efforts throughout the enterprise.

General  Officers,  Senior  Executives,  Command  Chief  Master  Sergeants  and HAF  Functional  Area  Managers  should  attend  the  Executive  Leader  Course.    SAF/MGM manages the course, but registration and scheduling are accomplished by AF/A1D.  AFI38-401  15 APRIL 2016 11 Chapter 4 CERTIFICATION, CURRENCY, AND EQUIVALENCY  4.1.  Certification.  4.1.1.  Certification  demonstrates  practitioner  credibility  to  commanders  and  project customers.    It  also  provides  a  developmental  path  for  CPI  practitioners  and  provides  a standard  CPI  approach  across  the  AF  enterprise.    Certification  requirements  are  listed  in Attachment 3.  4.1.2.  Air Force CPI certification consists of four elements:  completing training, performing CPI duties for  a specified minimum  length  of time, demonstrating capability to  accomplish project  work  to  a  published  standard,  and  gaining  a  recommendation  from  the  individual’s commander and MPO.  4.1.2.1.  Certification  scoring  methodology  for  project  work  is  posted  on  the  AF  CPI portal.  4.1.2.2.  Project work submitted for certification should be scoped at the appropriate level of  complexity  and  be  aligned  to  the  unit’s  strategy.    Use  the  following  DoD  scoping guidance as a reference.  This is not an all-inclusive description of project scope.  4.1.2.2.1.  Green Belt project scope is a single issue within a single process within an organization.  4.1.2.2.2.  Black  Belt  project  scope  is  a  single  process  in  an  organization(s) addressing multiple issues.    4.1.2.2.3.  Master  Black  Belt  project  scope  is  an  enterprise  issue  involving  no  less than two organizations.    4.1.2.2.4.  A  practitioner  may  need  to  accomplish  multiple  CPI  projects  before completing a project that demonstrates proficiency at the level of certification being pursued.  Practitioners should submit their best project for certification purposes.  4.1.3.  Practitioners  receiving  certification  should  update  their  military  and/or  civilian personnel  records  with  the  appropriate  Special  Experience  Identifier  (SEI).    (T-1)    See Attachment 4 for the list of relevant SEIs.  4.2.  Equivalency.  4.2.1.  Practitioners with CPI/LSS certifications from industry, academia, or non-AF agencies can  be  considered  for  AF  CPI  certification  and  should  request  consideration  through  their MPO.    The  MPO  will  interview  the  practitioner  to  assess  knowledge  of  AF  CPI  principles and  project  work,  and  provide  a  recommendation  to  the  appropriate  certification  authority.  The appropriate certification authority will update the AF CPI portal accordingly.  Air Force CPI  certification   Additional  equivalency requirements are summarized in Attachment 3.    time-in-position  durations  are  required. 4.2.2.  Certifications  previously  received  under  Air  Force  Smart  Operations  for  the  21st Century  (AFSO21)  and  AFSO  construct  are  automatically  considered  equivalent  to  the certifications outlined in this instruction.  No additional action is required.  12 4.3.  Currency.  AFI38-401  15 APRIL 2016 4.3.1.  After certification, practitioners should continue to facilitate and conduct CPI projects and  improve  their  skills.    However,  these  skills  can  diminish  over  time.    To  reinforce  a culture  of  continuous  learning  and  communicate  a  minimum  level  of  proficiency  to commanders,  practitioners  should  facilitate  one  project  or  mentor  a  lower-level  practitioner through one project annually.  The AF CPI portal is designed to track this currency.    4.3.2.  Practitioners must be current to teach GB training.  (T-2)  AFI38-401  15 APRIL 2016 13 Chapter 5 GOVERNANCE  5.1.  Enterprise Process Improvement Council (EPIC).  5.1.1.  The  Enterprise  Process  Improvement  Council  (EPIC)  ensures  Air  Force  strategic goals,  change  management  objectives,  and  strategic  priorities  are  enabled  by  ongoing  CPI efforts.

CPI  Project—A  problem  to  which  the  PPSM  and  CPI  tools  are  applied.    May  be  used  to maximize function effectiveness prior to assessing need for new manpower determinants model.  May generate just-do-its, rapid improvement events (RIE), or additional subordinate CPI projects as countermeasures.  Green Belt (GB)—Green Belts are entry-level process improvement practitioners.  They operate under  the  mentorship  of  experienced  BBs  and/or  MBBs.    Green  Belts  are  equipped  with  basic problem  solving  skills  and  competencies  to  eliminate  waste  and  maximize  customer  value  to solve process  problems that do not  cross organizational  boundaries.   Green  Belt work includes the deployment and application of lean principles, concepts and methods locally, within a work cell, work group or value stream.  Problems requiring more complex tool/technique application require the GB to seek out a BB for assistance.  Lean—A  CPI  methodology  focused  on  work  flow,  customer  value,  and  eliminating  process waste;  unique  from  traditional  process  improvement  strategies  in  that  its  primary  focus  is  on eliminating non-value added activities.  Master  Black  Belt  (MBB)—Master  Black  Belts  are  process  improvement  practitioners  with extensive  experience  and  are  capable  of  facilitating  the  most  complex  and  difficult  process improvement  challenges.    The  depth  and  breadth  gained  through  years  of  experience,  uniquely equip them with the necessary skills to mentor senior leaders and BBs.    Practical  Problem  Solving  Method  (PPSM)—Formerly  known  as  the  AF  8-Step  Problem Solving  Model.    Standardized  approach  to  properly  define  a  problem,  its  root  cause, countermeasures, and countermeasure implementation.  Provides a concise and common format for  presentation  of  data,  problem  solving  facts  and  information.    Eases  benchmarking  and sharing  of  best  practices  when  similar  problems  arise  in  other  areas.    The  structure  provides  a common language which more easily translates into common understanding.  Six  Sigma—A  disciplined,  data-driven  methodology  for  process  improvement  that  focuses  on satisfying  customer  requirements  while  minimizing  defects  by  reducing  waste  and  controlling process variation.  Theory  of  Constraints  (TOC)—A  systematic  approach  to  optimize  resource  utilization  by identifying,  exploiting,  subordinating,  elevating,  and  reassessing  constraints  in  the  process. Scientific principles are applied as a set of logical thinking processes to develop transformational breakthrough business solutions.  A constraint is any resource with capacity less than the demand placed upon it.  Theory of constraints attacks constraints and barriers (a restriction or other block to increases in output).   AFI38-401  15 APRIL 2016 19 Attachment 2 BLACK BELT TRAINING REQUIREMENTS  A2.1.
