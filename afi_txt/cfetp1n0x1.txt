This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.  NOTE:  Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training within the career field.  2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training…); Section D indicates resource constraints.  Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities; Section E, when used, identifies transition training guide requirements.  2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, core task, and correspondence course requirements; Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support materials.  An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP), which may be developed to support proficiency training.  These packages are identified in AFIND8, Numerical Index of Specialized Educational Training Publications; Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses; Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.    4   ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Training (AT).

NOTE:  All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code in this CFETP are trained during wartime. 9   Section A - General Information  1.  Purpose.  This CFETP provides information necessary for AFCFM, AFSM, MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 5-, 7- and 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  This CFETP also serves the following purposes:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field-training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.  1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual's career.  1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints, which impact, full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Uses.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.  2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM and AFSM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into this plan.  10   2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  2.4.  Converting to New CFETP.  Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative function, not a re-evaluation of training.  Therefore, supervisor and trainer are considered synonymous for the purpose of documentation.  Transcribe within 120 days (240 days for ARC) of CFETP revision date or from date revision is posted to automated training records system.  Upon publication of a new CFETP, use the following procedures to transcribe:  2.4.1.  Use the new CFETP to identify past and current training requirements and to transcribe qualifications from the previous CFETP.  2.4.2.  For tasks previously qualified/certified and required in the current duty position, circle the subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter the current date in the completion column.  Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current task certifier or supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column.  2.4.3.  For tasks previously certified but not required in the current duty position (do not circle), transcribe only the previous certification date (no initials).  If the task later becomes required in the duty position, recertify using current dates and initials.  2.4.4.  Annotate the AF Form 623a or automated version, (for example, “I certify the information contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded CFETP.” Signed and dated by supervisor and trainee).  2.5.  An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM.  NOTE:  AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for their career field.  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  The AFSM, MAJCOM representatives, and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AETC training manager for this specialty will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.    Section B - Career Progression and Information  4.  Specialty Description.  4.1.  Specialty Summary.  4.2.

For further information on applying to the National Intelligence University, visit http://ni-u.edu/wp/  7.7.  Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)  7.7.1.  Mission:  The Air Force Institute of Technology, or AFIT, is the Air Force’s graduate school of engineering and management as well as its institution for technical professional continuing education.  A component of Air University and Air Education and Training Command, AFIT is committed to providing defense-focused graduate and professional continuing education and research to sustain the technological supremacy of America’s air and space forces.  7.7.1.2.  Air Force Enlisted Application Process: 17   The “Enlisted-to-AFIT” program is a unique element of enlisted professional development.  In conjunction with other training and education programs, resident AFIT sponsored science, engineering, and management graduate degree opportunities further develop noncommissioned officers' technical education and skills.  This program is intended to enhance combat capability through career field core competency augmentation and to provide the air force with a source of highly proficient NCOS, technically experienced in their career field and highly educated through AFIT graduate degree programs.  Prospective students must meet service eligibility standards and receive a letter of academic eligibility from the Office of Admissions and the Registrar prior to selection and assignment to the Graduate School of Engineering and Management.  Interested NCO’s should apply for an academic review anytime.  HQ Air Force Personnel Center calls for applicants in November each year. The requirements vary, but generally speaking, a grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 on a 4-point scale is needed for the standard 18-month program, as well as either a Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score of 500 verbal/ 600 quantitative or, depending on the program, a Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) score of 550.  If an applicant does not meet the requirements of the typical in-resident program (generally 18 months), that individual will be evaluated for the possibility of an extended length program.  This would allow the time for the student to receive additional work to bolster their academic prowess and assure successful completion.  The in-residence program has no expiration date on the test scores.  There is generally some latitude in the minimal GPA and test scores.  Math requirements vary, but the level of math is rarely waived.  Eligibility for master's programs is judged based on undergraduate work, and to some extent, graduate work when present. Evaluations for an advanced academic degree program cannot be completed until the following documents are on file: your application, official transcripts from each school attended (even if only one course was taken), excluding CCAF and CLEP/DANTES transcripts, and a GRE or GMAT score report.  The GRE is acceptable for all resident programs; some will accept a GMAT or GRE. The Graduate School of Engineering and Management’s Admission Office only determines your academic eligibility.  HQ AFPC/DPAFE will establish selection procedures for Air Force enlisted members and announce their selections in late March or early April each year.  For more information check: http://www.afit.edu/  7.8.  Additional off-duty education is a personal choice that is encouraged for all.  Individuals desiring to become an Air Education and Training Command Instructor should be actively pursuing an associate’s degree.  A degreed faculty is necessary to maintain accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.     18   8.

As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, this STS:  2.1.  Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) in most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  Number task statements sequentially i.e., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies specialty-wide training requirements, and are identified by a “C.”  2.2.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use automated training management systems to document technician qualifications, if available.  Task certification must show a certification/completed date.  2.3.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.  See AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit training manager for current CDC listings.  2.4.  Qualitative Requirements.  Page 29 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.  2.5.  Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for OJT when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  2.5.1.  Documentation.  Document IAW AFI 36-2201.  An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM.  NOTE:  The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or when deemed necessary for their career field.  2.5.1.1.  Converting to New CFETP.  Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative function, not a re-evaluation of training.  Therefore, supervisor and trainer are considered synonymous for the purpose of documentation.  Transcribe within 120 days (240 days for ARC) of CFETP revision date or from date revision is posted to automated training records system.  Upon publication of a new CFETP, use the following procedures to transcribe:  2.5.1.1.1.  Use the new CFETP to identify past and current training requirements and to transcribe qualifications from the previous CFETP.  2.5.1.1.2.  For tasks previously qualified/certified and required in the current duty position, circle the subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter the current date in the completion 26   column.  Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current task certifier or supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column.  2.5.1.1.3.  For tasks previously certified but not required in the current duty position (do not circle), transcribe only the previous certification date (no initials).  If the task later becomes required in the duty position, recertify using current dates and initials.  2.5.1.1.4.  Annotate the AF Form 623a or automated version, (for example, “I certify the information contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded CFETP.” Signed and dated by supervisor and trainee).  2.5.1.2.  Documenting Career Knowledge.  When a CDC is not available, the supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, at a minimum, that trainees cover the mandatory items in Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (ECD).  For two-time CDC course exam failures: Commanders may direct that supervisors identify all STS items corresponding to the areas covered by the CDC.  The trainee completes a study of STS references, undergoes evaluation by the task certifier, and receives certification on the STS.  NOTE:  Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.  2.5.1.3.  Decertification and Re-certification.  When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor lines through the previous certification or deletes previous certification when using an automated system.  Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623a, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for decertification.  The individual is re-certified (if required) either by erasing the old entries and writing in the new or by using correction fluid (if the entries were made in ink) over the previously certified entry.  NOTE:  Entry should always be in pencil.  2.5.2.  Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the designated proficiency level that meets local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures.  2.6.  This CFETP is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  A team of senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career field develops Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  Individual responsibilities can be located in AFI 36-2502, ENLISTED AIRMAN PROMOTION/DEMOTION PROGRAMS.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air Reserve Component.  3.  Recommendations.  Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates.
