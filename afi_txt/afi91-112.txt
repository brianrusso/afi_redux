Self-defense munitions loaded on aircraft and one additional load of air-to-air missiles, chaff, and flares, and an aircraft gun loading system, which may contain multiple loads, are permitted. (T-0). 16.4.  Authorized operations involving both nuclear weapons and conventional munitions in a  PAS  with  WSV  (e.g.,  nuclear  generation,  command  disablement  operations,  and  CJCS-directed  SEV)  always  require  MAJCOM-approved  plans.    The  appropriate  host/US  wing commander must authorize each operation prior to start.  Self-defense munitions as described above do not require a plan. (T-0). 16.5.  Only  aircraft  NOT  loaded  with  live  munitions  (except  for  captive  air-to-air  missiles, chaff,  flares,  and  aircraft  target  practice  gun  ammunition)  and  associated  ground  support equipment can remain in the PAS while performing maintenance on the WSV, or authorized weapons  maintenance  in  the  WSV,  provided  all  other  activities  within  the  PAS  are terminated.
