SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  document  is  substantially  revised  and  must  be  completely  reviewed.   Major  changes include the following:  This revision adds roles and responsibilities in chapter 2.    Updates Table 4.1, Determining Duty or Chargeable leave and provides examples.  Updates to Maternity Leave policy are reflected in paragraphs 4.2.1.1.1, 4.2.1.1.1.1, 4.2.1.1.1.2 and Table 4.3, rule 2.  Clearly aligns Table 4.5, Authorizing PTDY, under the guidance of DoD Instruction 1327.06, Leave and Liberty  Procedures,  and  reduces  49  rules  to  21;  note  some  may  be  renumbered  from  previous version of AFI and obsolete rules have been deleted.  Rule 4 was expanded allowing rules 8-10 (from  previous  version)  to  be  deleted.    All  rules  pertaining  to  Professional  Development  are captured in Rule 7 (this rule combined rules 15,16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 34, 39 and 45 from previous  AFI  version).    Deletes  rules  pertaining  to  non-sectarian  national  youth  organization participation,  presenting  inspector  general  complaints,  to  complete  naturalization  processing, aero  club  aircraft,  procurement  of  artifacts,  tattoo  removal  and  to  participate  in  medical charitable/mission trips. The rule to obtain a legal marriage (CONUS) was also deleted as same-sex  marriage is legal in all U.S states.   Adds new rule 21, which authorizes PTDY for any AF member to serve as the presiding official at a military retirement ceremony.  Removes paragraph 12.2, Exception to Policy for permissive temporary duty (PTDY). Adds paragraph 7.13 allowing a Reserve Component member who accumulates leave during a period of active service to carry over any leave accumulated to the member’s next period of active service. Removes instructions for  preparing  AF  Form  972,  as  well  as  instructions  for  preparing  DD  Form  1610  for  IPCOT, Deferred  COT  Leave  Travel  or  for  15  days  of  OTEIP  Leave;  instructions  for  preparing  forms available on MyPers.

Ensure members sign statements of understanding that they normally do not return to duty  when  terminal  leave  begins.    Exception:  Unit  commanders  may  recall  members  from leave due to military necessity or urgent, unforeseen circumstances. 2.5.4.  May  not  change  established  dates  of  separation  so  that  members  may  take  unused leave. 2.5.5.  Ensure members taking ordinary leave instead of terminal leave return 15 days before their scheduled dates of separation or retirement to prevent pay problems. 2.5.6.  Ensure that members remain  assigned  to  their  organizations  until  they separate or retire. 2.6.  Unit/Squadron Commander (CC) or equivalent. 2.6.1.  Establish annual leave programs to give members opportunity to use leave. 2.6.2.  Enforce Air Force and command-approved leave guidelines. 2.6.3.  Make  sure  members  who  refuse  to  take  leave  understand  their  obligation  to  comply with unit leave programs and that refusal to take leave may result in the loss of earned leave at a later date. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   7  2.6.4.  Instruct  members  to  schedule  leave  within  operational  requirements  and  follow  their leave schedule. 2.6.5.  Encourage members to take one leave of at least 14 continuous days every FY and to use leave accrued each FY. 2.6.6.  Inform    members    that    there    may    be    instances    of    leave    disapproval    or cancellation due to military necessity. 2.6.7.  Ensure members schedule leave annually at the beginning of the FY and update their leave schedule periodically. 2.6.8.  Advise members who schedule “use or lose” leave in Aug or Sep that they risk losing leave on 1 Oct if military requirements or personal circumstances prevent them from taking leave at that particular time. 2.6.9.  Seek,  if  necessary,  American  Red  Cross  (ARC)  verification  when  members  request emergency leave. 2.6.10.  Charge  leave  for  leave  periods  such  as  those  taken  by  members  waiting  for  family members’ passports or visas or for the outcome of humanitarian reassignment requests. 2.6.11.  Combine ordinary leave with other types of leave unless specifically prohibited and treat the combination of leaves as one leave period. 2.6.12.  Charge members leave for travel time, delay en route, and time spent house hunting in conjunction with a permissive reassignment. 2.6.13.  Provide  an  opportunity  to  use  leave  to  Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard members  serving  man-day  tours  longer  than  30  consecutive  days  under  AFI  36-2619, Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) Man-Day Program. AFI 36-2619 authorizes use of accrued  leave.  See  AFI  36-2254,  Volume  I,  Reserve  Personnel  Participation,  for  Reserve Personnel Appropriations (RPA) tours over 30 days. 2.6.14.  Normally  do  not  grant  leave  to  members  undergoing  treatment  for  an  infectious  or contagious disease.  Exception: Unit commander may grant leave if the attending physician provides written verification that the member does not pose a threat to the public health. 2.6.15.  Do not grant leave for the purpose of serving sentences in civil confinement because civil  confinement, including probated sentences thereto,  is inconsistent with  military  status. Comment: Members confined by civil authorities while on approved leave may continue on leave  until  the  original  leave  termination  date,  unless  recalled  from  leave  status  to  duty.  If unit  commander  recalls  member  to  duty,  terminate  leave  status  as  of  the  recall  date  and change the member’s status to “absent in the hands of civil authorities.” 2.6.16.  Ensure guidelines are followed in accordance with (IAW) AFI 33-332, The Air Force Privacy  and  Civil Liberties  Program,  Commander's  Policy, and  DoD  Regulation  5400.7-R, DoD  Freedom  of  Information  Act  Program,  for  instructions  when  transmitting,  receiving, collecting,  maintaining,  storing,  or  distributing  Privacy  Act  Information  to  ensure  they maintain the protection of privacy rights of individuals, and to minimize the opportunity for privacy violations to occur.   8  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 Chapter 3 MANAGING THE LEAVE PROGRAM 3.1.   Military Leave Program  3.1.1. Statutory Authority.  The more common statutes are: 3.1.1.1.  Title 10, U.S.C., section 701, Entitlement and Accumulation. 3.1.1.2.  Title 10, U.S.C., section 704, Use of Leave; Regulations. 3.1.1.3.  Title    10,    U.S.C.,    section    705,    Rest    and    Recuperative    (R&R)    Absence: Qualified   Members  Extending  Duty  at  Designated  Locations  Overseas.      R&R  and  the overseas tour extension incentive program (OTEIP) are synonymous. 3.1.1.4.  Title 10, U.S.C., section 706, Administration of Leave Required to be Taken. 3.1.1.5.  Title  37,  U.S.C.,  section  411b,  Travel  and  Transportation  Allowances:  Travel Performed in Connection with Leave between Consecutive Overseas Tours. 3.1.1.6.  Title  37,  U.S.C.,  section  411g,  Travel  and  Transportation  Allowances: Transportation Incident to Voluntary Extensions of Overseas Tours of Duty.  This is also referred to as the overseas tour extension incentive program (OTEIP) and is synonymous with R&R. 3.1.1.7.  Title 37, U.S.C., section 501, Payment for Unused Accrued Leave. 3.1.2.  Annual  Leave  Program.    Annual  leave  programs  give  members  the  opportunity  to take  leave  within  the  constraints  of  operational  requirements.    Unit  commanders  establish these  programs  to  encourage  the  use  of  leave  for  the  maximum  benefit  of  the  member. Scheduling  leave  prevents  loss  of  leave  at  fiscal  year  (FY)-end  balancing,  retirement,  or separation  from  active  duty.    Both  management  and  members  share  responsibility  in managing  leave  balances  throughout  the  FY.    Note:  Leave  is  a  right;  however,  unit commanders can deny leave due to military necessity or when in the best interests of the Air Force. 3.1.3.  Safe  Travel  Guidelines.    Members  on  leave  or  on  other  non-duty  status  should  use Risk  Management  principles  to  assess  all  hazards  and  control  risks  prior  to  excessive  or hazardous  travel,  especially  by  automobile.    Applicable  guidelines  are  in  AFI  90-802,  Risk Management.  A comprehensive risk  management assessment may conclude that fatigue  or road conditions are high risks requiring a change to travel plans. 3.1.4.  Use of Leave.  The use of leave is essential to the morale and motivation of members and  for  maintaining  maximum  effectiveness.    Lengthy  respites  from  the  work  environment  tend  to  have  a  beneficial  effect  on  an  individual’s psychological  and physical status.   Weekend absences (regular pass) or short periods of leave do not normally afford a similar degree of relief.  In providing leave, Congress intended for members to use their leave as it accrues.  Congress provides for payment of accrued leave when members are unable to use their leave because of military necessity.  However, Congress  did  not  intend  for  members  to    accrue    large    leave    balances    expressly    for  payment  of  accrued  leave.      All  members should have the opportunity to take at least one leave period of 14 consecutive days or more AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   9  every  FY  and  are  encouraged  to  use  the  30  days  accrued  each  FY.      Supervisors  and commanders  will  encourage  members  to  use  leave,  military  requirements  permitting,  and consider the desires of the member.  See para 4.1.1.1 for typical uses of annual leave. 3.2.  Leave  Approval  Authority.  While  commanders  have  final  approval  authority,  they  may delegate  approval  authority  according  to  the  organization’s  needs.    Normally,  annual  leave requests are delegated to a level no lower than the first-line supervisor. 3.3.  Leave  Disapproval  Authority.  Leave  is  a  right;  however,  unit  commanders  can disapprove leave requests due to military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force. 3.1.3.1.  Unit  commanders  may  delegate  disapproval  authority  to  a  level  no  lower  than first-line supervisors.  Commanders   may   adjust   delegation   of   authority   based on mission requirements. 3.4.  Leave Accrual.  Title 10, U.S.C., section 701, governs leave accrual and accumulation. 3.4.1.  Accrual.   Members accrue 2.5 days leave for each month of active duty.  See Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2 below. 3.4.2.  Accumulation.   Members who are unable to use leave due to military necessity may accumulate  a  maximum  of  60  days  by  the  end  of  a  FY.      See  Chapter  6  for  special  leave accrual (SLA) provisions.  Members not eligible for SLA can request recovery of days lost on 1 Oct by submitting a DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Record Under the Provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 1552.

FY-end Leave Balancing.  Members may not carry leave in excess of 60 days into the next FY.    At  the  end  of  the  FY,  they  lose  leave  in  excess  of  60  days  unless  eligible  for  SLA.  The Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) drops accrued leave in excess of 60 days at FY-end leave  balancing  unless  automatic  carry-over  of  SLA  applies.    See  Chapter  6,  Special  Leave Accrual. 3.6.  Payment  for  Accrued  Leave.  Title  37,  U.S.C.,  section  501,  is  the  authority  for  payment for accrued leave upon reenlistment, retirement, separation under honorable conditions, or death.  It limits payment of accrued leave to 60 days in a military career effective 10 Feb 76. A military career  includes  former  service  in  enlisted  or  officer  status.    Cumulative  payment  for  accrued leave as an enlisted member, officer, or both cannot exceed 60 days. DoD Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Department of Defense Financial Management, Military Pay Policy - Active Duty and  Reserve  Pay,  Table  35-1  outlines  when  members  may  carry  leave  forward  or  receive AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   11  payment  for  accrued  leave  when  separating  with  or  without  immediate  reentry  on  active  duty. See your financial services office for detailed information on payment of accrued leave. 3.1.6.1.  An additional one-time Special Leave Accrual (SLA) sell back is authorized for enlisted  Service  members.      An  enlisted  member  may  sell  back  up  to  30  days  of  SLA, provided they have an excess of 120 days of leave.  Members may exercise this one-time option only when the member would lose accumulated leave in excess of 120 days.  Such a sell back counts towards the Service member’s cap of 60 days over a career. 3.7.  Disability Separation. 3.7.1.  DoD  Guidelines.  DoD  processing  requirements  require  members  to  receive  payment for up to 60 days accrued leave and afford them time to take any accrued leave in excess of this 60-day limit. 3.7.2.  Determining      Retirement      or  Separation      Date.            HQ      AFPC/DPFD  (Physical Disability Division) determines a member’s separation date, taking into account: 3.7.2.1.  Leave balance and leave accruing in excess of the 60-day accrued leave payment limitation for members authorized payment for up to 60 days of accrued leave. 3.7.2.2.  Accrued  leave  and  leave  accruing  to  the  date  of  separation  for  members previously paid for 60 days. 3.7.2.3.  PTDY authorized. 3.7.2.4.  Processing time.    Members  may  take  accrued  leave instead  of  processing  time.  Example: A member previously paid for 40 days of accrued leave and has a leave balance of 70 days.  In this case, the member receives payment for 20 days and can take leave for the remaining 50 days plus leave accruing to date of separation.   If member is receiving payment for accrued leave for the first time, he or she receives payment for 60 days.   The member  then  can  take  leave  for  the  remaining  10  days  plus  leave  accruing  to  date  of separation.  The established date of separation remains firm and members forfeit accrued leave  if  unable  to  take  leave  due  to  extenuating  circumstances  (for  example, hospitalization or convalescent leave).  Note: Paragraph 3.7.2. does not apply to members separating or retiring because of imminent death. 3.7.3.  Leave Awaiting Orders.  Charge leave as accrued and accruing when the commander sends  a  member  home  or  to  another  location  in  a  PCS  status  to  await  orders  for  disability separation.   Charge  any remaining  time as  an authorized absence after the member uses all accrued leave. 3.8.  Leave Outside the United States: 3.8.1.  Authority to Grant Leave Outside the United States. Unit commanders may authorize members  to  take  leave  in  areas  outside  the  continental  United  States,  Alaska,  Hawaii,  or United States possessions.   If leave is in conjunction with PCS or TDY, include on the PCS or TDY order: 3.8.1.1.  The  area  or  country  of  final  destination  and  each  country  the  member  will  be visiting. 3.8.1.2.  A  leave  address  and  telephone  number  through  which  the  unit  may  contact  the member.    Note:  Members  taking  leave  overseas  en  route  to  their  overseas  assignment   12  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 must sign a statement agreeing to the fact they cannot report earlier than their report not later  than  date  (RNLTD)  month.  (T-3)  Include  in  the  PCS  orders:  “In  connection  with member’s leave overseas en route to the overseas assignment, member has agreed to the fact that reporting to the new assignment may not be earlier than the RNLTD month.” 3.8.2.  Ordinary  Leave  When  Not  Assigned  Overseas.  Include  on  the  AF  Form  988,  Leave Request/Authorization: 3.8.2.1.  The  area  or  country  of  final  destination  and  each  country  the  member  will  be visiting. 3.8.2.2.  A  leave  address  and  telephone  number  through  which  the  unit  may  contact  the member. 3.8.3.  Ordinary  Leave  When  Assigned  Overseas.  Follow  overseas  host  MAJCOM procedures for processing and approving leave.  Include on the AF Form 988: 3.8.3.1.  The  area  or  country  of  final  destination  and  each  country  the  member  will  be visiting. 3.8.3.2.  A  leave  address  and  telephone  number  through  which  the  unit  may  contact  the member. 3.8.4.  Special Instructions for All Members Taking Leave in Overseas Area: 3.8.4.1.  Instruct members to comply with foreign government procedures as required by AFI 16-606, Foreign Clearance Program, to include the DoD Travel Security Advisory. Ensure they also comply  with  security  procedures prescribed for visits to communist or communist-controlled countries. The passport/visa section in the MPS maintains a copy of the guide and advisory. 3.8.4.2.  When the purpose of the visit is marriage to a foreign national, the requirements of  existing  marriage  instructions  of  the  Air  Force  commander  in  the  area  where  the marriage  occurs  apply.    The  approving  commander  ensures  that  the  member  can  meet these requirements during the leave period. 3.9.  Forms to Document Leave and PTDY: 3.9.1.  Normally  use  the  AF  Form  988  for  all  types  of  leave  and  PTDY.  AFMAN  65-116, Volume 2, Chapter 7, Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) Unit Procedures Excluding FSO, contains leave processing procedures using the AF Form 988. 3.9.1.1.  Use the AF Form 972, Request and Authorization for Emergency Leave Travel, for  members  authorized  funded  emergency  leave  travel.  See  paragraph  4.1.3.9, Emergency  Leave,  of  this  AFI.  AFI  65-114,  requires  the  AF  Form  972  to  document authorized emergency leave travel. 3.9.1.2.  Use  DD  Form  1610,  Request  and  Authorization  for  TDY  Travel  of  DoD Personnel,  for  participants  or  trainees  authorized  space-required  travel  with  PTDY  for sports, recreation or talent events.  See Table 4.5, Rule 12, of this AFI. 3.9.1.3.  Use  DD  Form  1610  for  deferred  consecutive  overseas  tour  (COT)  leave  or  in-place COT (IPCOT) leave.  See paragraph 7.3, Determining Deferred COT Allowance, of this AFI. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   13  3.9.1.4.  Use  DD  Form  1610  for  15-day  Special Rest &Recuperation (SR&R)  leave  under  the  OTEIP.    See paragraph 7.6, SR&R or OTEIP, of this AFI. 3.9.2.  Place the authorization for PTDY for house hunting in conjunction with reassignment on the PCS orders when: 3.9.2.1.  Members reassigned with TDY en route or 3.9.2.2.  Members  authorized  to  relocate  family  members  to  a  designated  place  when going  to  or  returning  from  an  overseas  unaccompanied  tour.    Note:      If  commander approves PTDY, the MPS includes the following statement on the PCS orders: “Member has authorization for (number of days, not to exceed 10) PTDY for the purpose of house hunting.” 3.9.3.  When  members  take  leave  en  route,  authorized  PTDY,  or  both,  with  PCS  or  TDY travel,  the  financial  services  office  (FSO)  uses  the  travel  voucher  to  determine  authorized travel, authorized PTDY, and chargeable leave. 3.9.4.  Local  Instructions  to  AF  Form  988.    Unit  commanders  send  requests  to  add  local instructions  to  the  AF  Form  988  to  HQ  USAF/A1PA,  Military  Compensation  Policy Division, 1500 W. Perimeter Rd, Suite 4780, Joint Base Andrews, MD 20762. 3.10.  Holidays.  Public  holidays  established  by  Federal  statute  are  non-working  days,  military operations permitting. When a holiday falls on a Saturday, the non-working day is the preceding Friday.    When  a  holiday  falls  on  a  Sunday,  the  non-working  day  is  the  following  Monday. Holidays  are  chargeable  leave  days  if  they  occur  during  an  authorized  period  of  leave.    If departure on a period of leave is on a holiday, the holiday is a day of leave.  If return from an authorized period of leave is on a holiday, the holiday is not a day of leave. Commanders  may  be  as  liberal  as  training,  mission,  and  local  conditions  permit  in authorizing leave during the Christmas and New Year’s Day period. 3.10.1.  New Year’s Day, 1 January. 3.10.2.  Martin Luther King’s Birthday, the third Monday in January. 3.10.3.  Washington’s Birthday, the third Monday in February. 3.10.4.  Memorial Day, the last Monday in May. 3.10.5.  Independence Day, 4 July. 3.10.6.  Labor Day, the first Monday in September. 3.10.7.  Columbus Day, the second Monday in October. 3.10.8.  Veterans Day, 11 November. 3.10.9.  Thanksgiving Day, the fourth Thursday in November. 3.10.10.  Christmas Day, 25 December. 3.10.11.  Other holidays as directed by proper authority under the law. 3.11.  Miscellaneous Information: 3.11.1.  Leave  for  Enforcement  of  Child  Support  Obligation.    Unit  commanders  approve leave  requested  to  attend  hearings  to  determine  paternity  or  to  determine  an  obligation  to   14  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 provide child support.  Unit commanders may disapprove such leave requests if the member is serving in or with a unit deployed in a contingency operation or exigencies of the military service require a denial of such request. 3.11.2.  TDY  from  Leave  Status.    A  member  ordered  TDY  while  on  leave  reverts  to  duty status as of the TDY effective date.  Annotate the TDY orders to show whether the member is reverting to leave status originally authorized or is returning to his or her duty station upon completing the TDY. 3.11.3.  Recall from Leave.   Unit commanders may recall members from leave for military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force.  When recalling a member, do not charge the period  of  absence  as  leave  when  the  period  between  departure  on  leave  and  the  member’s receipt  of  recall  is  3  days  or  less.      Consider  the  remaining  time  of  absence  as  travel  time, unless  the  unit  commander  determines  it  is  clearly  excessive  to  the  circumstances.    If determined excessive, charge the entire period of absence as leave. 3.11.3.1.  Refer  to  the  JTR,  paragraph  7045,  Recall  from  Leave,  to  determine  whether travel and transportation allowances apply.  If so, member reverts to duty status the day travel to the permanent or TDY station begins.   Annotate travel orders to show the date the member reverts to duty status. Use the travel orders to cancel the remaining portion of leave. 3.11.3.2.  If the unit commander authorizes the member to resume leave after the member completes  the  duty  that  resulted  in  recall,  prepare  a  new  AF  Form  988.  If  authorized travel, publish orders to return the member to the location where he or she received recall notification. 3.11.4.  Absence Over Leave: 3.11.4.1.  See  DoD  Regulation  7000.14-R,      Volume      7A,      Military      Pay      Policy      -Active Duty and Reserve Pay, to determine whether an absence was unavoidable. 3.11.4.2.  Charge  leave  for  an  absence  in  excess  of  authorized  leave  or  pass  if  the  unit commander later determines it to be unavoidable; otherwise, consider it absence without leave. 3.11.4.3.  Do  not  charge  leave  for  an  absence  in  excess  of  authorized  leave  caused  by mental incapacity, detention by civil authorities, and early departure of a mobile unit due to operational commitments.   This applies whether the absence is avoidable or excused as unavoidable, regardless of duration. 3.11.4.4.  Charge  leave  for  other  unauthorized  absences  that  the  unit  commander determines to have been avoidable. 3.11.5.  Unable  to  Return  from  Leave  Because  of  Illness  or  Injury.    When  a  member  is unable to return to duty from leave because of illness or injury: 3.11.5.1.  The member must advise the leave approving authority by the quickest means. (T-3) 3.11.5.2.  The  next  of  kin,  attending  military  or  civilian  physician,  nearest  military medical  treatment  facility  (MTF),  or  ARC  may  act  on  the  member’s  behalf  when incapacitated to such a degree that notification by the member is not possible. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   15  3.11.5.3.  Upon  return  from  leave,  the  member  presents  a  statement  from  the  nearest MTF or the attending physician regarding the individual’s medical condition.   The unit commander evaluates the statement before authenticating the leave document. 3.11.5.4.  The  unit  commander  may  consult  with  the  local  medical  treatment  facility  or ARC providers for clarification or recommendation. 3.11.5.5.  Unit commander issues amended leave authorization, if required. 3.11.6.  Medical, Dental, Hospitalized or Placed on Quarters. 3.11.6.1.  Medical  or  Dental  Care.  When  a  member  on  leave  requires  medical  or  dental care,  he  or  she  reports  to  the  nearest  military  medical  treatment  facility.    If  treated  at civilian  facilities,  governing  directives  authorize  medical  or  dental  treatment  from civilian  sources  at  government  expense  only  for  emergency  and  immediate  non-emergency care. 3.11.6.2.  Hospitalized  or  Placed  on  Quarters.      If  a  member  on  leave  requires hospitalization    or    quarters    status,   do    not    charge    leave   while    hospitalized    or    on quarters.      Chargeable  leave  ends  the  day  before  and  starts  again  the  day  following hospitalization  or  quarters’  status,  regardless  of  the  hour  of  admission  or  discharge  or release from quarters. 3.11.6.3.  If a military health care provider places the member on quarters, the member’s status  changes  from  leave  to  quarters,  and  the  medical  authority  directing  such  status notifies the individual’s commander.   The nearest military health care provider approves civilian health care provider’s placement of members on quarters. If the member desires to revert to leave status after release from quarters: 3.11.6.3.1.  On  return  to  duty,  the  member  provides  the  leave  approving  authority with  a  statement  from  the  attending  physician  or  military  treatment  facility  that certifies  the  period  of  quarters  and  date  of  release.    This  statement  is  usually  the admission and disposition list of the medical treatment facility. 3.11.6.4.  The  above  provisions  apply  to  a  member  hospitalized  or  placed  on  quarters while on emergency leave in CONUS or overseas.  After termination of hospitalization or quarters’ status, the member contacts the traffic management office (TMO) at the nearest Air Force installation for assistance with return transportation, if required. 3.11.7.  Absent  Without  Leave  (AWOL).      The  MPS  and  HQ  AFPC/DPFCM  (Missing Persons  Branch)  change  members’  leave  status  to  AWOL  when  members  fail  to  return  to duty at the end of their leave period. 3.11.8.  Proceed  Time.    MPSs  administer  proceed  time  IAW  AFI  36-2102,  Base-Level Relocation  Procedures.    The  FSO  computes  leave  for  authorized  absences  in  excess  of allowed proceed time. 3.11.9.  Travel Time with En Route Leave.  The time allowed for PCS or TDY travel is not chargeable  leave  when  members  take  en  route  leave.  The  FSO  charges  leave  for  any authorized absence in excess of allowable travel time and proceed time, if applicable. 3.11.10.  Missing  Port  Call.    Aerial  port  passenger  section  personnel  notify  the  servicing MPS and HQ AFPC/DPFCM within 72 hours after members miss a port call.   16  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 3.11.11.  Retiree Continued on Active Duty.    Retirees who continue on active duty without a break in service qualify to carry over their leave balance into the period of continued active duty. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   17  Chapter 4 TYPES OF LEAVE 4.1.  Chargeable Leave: 4.1.1.  Annual  Leave.    Another  name  for  annual  leave  is  “ordinary”  leave.    Normally, members  request  leave,  as  accruing,  within  mission  requirements  and  other  exigencies.  Member’s  failure  to  use  leave,  as  accruing,  can  result  in  loss  of  accrued  leave  at  FY-end leave balancing or upon retirement or separation from active duty. 4.1.1.1.  Use of Annual Leave.  Members typically use annual leave: 4.1.1.1.1.  For vacation or short periods of rest from duty. 4.1.1.1.2.  To attend to parental family needs such as illnesses. 4.1.1.1.3.  With  a  PCS  or  after  periods  of  arduous  duty  and  protracted  periods  of deployment from the home station. 4.1.1.1.4.  During traditional national holiday periods. 4.1.1.1.5.  To  attend  to  family  emergencies  or  personal  situations  caused  by  natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes. 4.1.1.1.6.  For attendance at spiritual events or for other religious observances. 4.1.1.1.7.  During the pre-processing period incident to release from active duty. 4.1.1.1.8.  As  terminal  leave  with  retirement  or  separation  from  active  duty.  However,  members  separating  under  Palace  Chase/Palace  Front  may  carry  any unused leave over to the RC as long as there is no break in service (ref. para 4.1.1.1.9 and para 7.13) for future use. 4.1.1.1.9.  Prior  to  the  end  of  an  active  duty  tour  for  Reserve  Component  (RC) personnel.  However, an RC member who accumulates leave during a period of active service  may  carry  over  any  leave  so  accumulated  to  the  member's  next  period  of active  service,  subject  to  the  accumulation  limits  in  section  701  of  Title  10  of  the United States Code, without regard to separation or release from active service if the separation or release is under honorable conditions.  Note: Members separating under “for  cause”  provisions  and  other  separatees  separating  at  the  earliest  possible  date cannot take terminal leave.    They either receive payment for unused accrued leave or forfeit  the  accrued  days  if  they  receive  a  discharge  under  other  than  honorable conditions. 4.1.1.2.  Unit  Approval Level.      Unit  commanders  are the  approval  authority  for  annual leave  requests  and  normally  delegate  approval  to  a  level  no  lower  than  the  first-line supervisor. 4.1.1.2.1.  For  headquarters’  staff,  commanders  delegate  leave  approval  to  no  lower than assistant functional deputy directors or equivalent. 4.1.1.2.2.  Unit commanders can disapprove leave requests for military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force.   18  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 4.1.1.3.  TDY Commanders. 4.1.1.3.1.  Notify parent organizations of leave requests. 4.1.1.3.2.  Approve leaves with which the parent organizations agree. 4.1.1.3.3.  Send  e-mail  as  appropriate.    Note:  Paragraphs  4.1.1.3.1  through  4.1.1.3.3 apply to PERSCO Team Chiefs at deployed locations. 4.1.1.3.4.  Charge leave to members attending AETC formal schools that close for the Christmas and New Year's Day holidays.  Do not charge them leave if they perform authorized  duty  at  the  TDY  site  or  report  for  approved  duty  to  their  home  station during  holiday  periods.      When  their  permanent  duty  station  commanders  concur, members  may  return  to  the  home  station  to  perform  duty.      If  so,  allowances prescribed  in  JTR,  paragraph  U4440,  Voluntary  Return  to  PDS  or  for  Personal Reasons, may apply.  See AFI 65-114. 4.1.1.4.  Commanders  Reporting  Directly  to  the  Chief  of  Staff,  Vice  Chief  of  Staff,  or Assistant  Vice  Chief  of Staff.    These  commanders  approve their  own  leave.  Send leave notification by e-mail at least 7 days in advance to HQ USAF/CVA. Include in the leave notification: 4.1.1.4.1.  Effective date of leave. 4.1.1.4.2.  Duration. 4.1.1.4.3.  Leave address and telephone number. 4.1.1.4.4.  Name of acting commander.  Note: HQ USAF/CVA advises commanders when extenuating circumstances require adjustments to scheduled leaves. 4.1.1.5.  Leave in Conjunction With TDY.  Unit commanders: 4.1.1.5.1.  Determine TDY is clearly essential to the mission. 4.1.1.5.2.  Make  certain  members  do  not  take,  schedule,  plan,  or  arrange,  in  fact  or appearance, TDY to serve leave desires of the member. 4.1.1.5.3.  Authorize leave when operationally feasible. 4.1.1.5.4.  Ensure the government incurs  no additional cost incident to  leave.   Note: Members may not use non-duty days to extend the TDY or leave period. 4.1.1.6.  Leave Extensions: 4.1.1.6.1.  The member must ask, orally or in writing, for the extension sufficiently in advance of expiration of leave authorized to permit return to duty at the proper time if the approval authority disapproves the extension. (T-3) 4.1.1.6.2.  Members  who  fall  ill  or  need  hospitalization  while  on  leave  must  advise the leave-approving authority as soon as possible.  See para 3.1.11.6. (T-3) 4.1.1.6.3.  The next  of kin,  attending physician, nearest MTF, or  ARC  may act on  a member's behalf. 4.1.1.7.  Leave Begins and Ends in the Local Area.  The local area is the place where the member lives and from which he or she commutes to the duty station.  Charge leave for AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   19  duty days and non-duty days (for example, Friday through Monday) when members take leave on the day before and the day after non-duty days.  This applies to leave taken in the local area. Exception: When a member’s leave ends on a day before a non-duty day, the commander may authorize leave on the next duty day for an emergency situation and not charge leave for the non-duty days.  If the member knew of the emergency situation before  his  or  her  departure  on  the  original  leave,  charge  the  member  leave  for  the weekend or other non-duty days. 4.1.1.7.1.  Normally, leave begins on the effective date reflected on the AF Form 988. If the leave start date changes, make the change to the leave status date and leave start date on the leave form.  The member and leave approval authority initial the changes before the member departs on leave. 4.1.1.7.2.  Normally, leave ends on the effective date reflected on the AF Form 988. Change  the  last  day  of  leave  on  Part  III  of  the  leave  form  if  the  leave  approval authority approves an extension or if the member returns early. 4.1.1.8.  Leave  Overlaps  Two  FYs.    When  a  member’s  leave  period  overlaps  two  FYs, the DJMS reduces the member’s leave account in the FY in which the member takes the leave.  Example: The DJMS charges 5 days to the previous FY and 5 days to the next FY when a member takes 10 days leave, 26 Sep - 5 Oct. 4.1.1.9.  FSO.      The  FSO  computes  leave  for  authorized  absences  in  excess  of  allowed travel time, PTDY, and proceed time, if applicable.  Members can ask the FSO to verify regular and SLA leave balances to determine “use or lose” leave status.   “Use or lose” leave means leave days members lose if not used before 1 Oct. 4.1.1.10.  Leave or Duty Status.  Determine leave based on the actual date members start leave and actual return date from leave according to Table 4.1 below.  Charge leave for non-duty  days,  including  holidays,  if  the  non-duty  days  fall  between  leave  days.    This applies  to  members  who  take  leave  in,  or  away  from,  the  local  area.  Exception:  Commanders  may  authorize  leave  on  Monday  without  charging  leave  for  Saturday  and Sunday  if  an  emergency  situation  requires  a  member  to  take  unplanned  leave  and  the member is in the local area.  This applies when members take leave on Friday.   20  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 Table 4.1.  Determining Duty or Chargeable Leave.

Comments:  Leave  status  is  not  necessarily  chargeable  leave.      For  example,  a  member  is on leave status after working at least 50% of the duty day, and the following day is the first day of  chargeable  leave.    However,  a  member  cannot  sign  up  for  space-available  transportation before the first day and time of leave status. 4.1.1.11.  Examples  of  chargeable  leave.    The  following  examples  use  a  normal  work schedule  of  Monday  through  Friday,  0730  to  1630.  (For  members  on  shift  work  or alternate work schedules, arranged equivalent schedules may vary.) 4.1.1.11.1.  Example  1.  If  the  member  starts  leave  or  signs  up  for  space-available transportation on Tuesday: 4.1.1.11.1.1.  Tuesday is a duty day and Wednesday is the first day of leave when the leave approving authority determines that the member performed the majority (over 50%) of scheduled duty on Tuesday. 4.1.1.11.1.2.  Tuesday  is  the  first  day  of  leave  if  the  leave  approval  authority determines  that  the  member  performed  less  than  50%  of  scheduled  duty  on Tuesday. 4.1.1.11.2.  Example  2.  Saturday is a day of leave if the member, regardless of the hour, starts leave or signs up for space-available transportation on Saturday. 4.1.1.11.3.  Example  3.    Sunday  is  a  day  of  leave,  if  the  member,  regardless  of  the hour, starts leave or signs up for space-available transportation on Sunday. 4.1.1.11.4.  Example 4.  Friday is a day of duty and Thursday is the last day of leave if the leave approving authority determines the member performed the majority (over 50%) of scheduled duty on Friday. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   21  4.1.1.11.5.  Example 5.  If the member returns from leave on Saturday, regardless of the  hour,  Saturday  shall  not  be  charged  as  a  day  of  leave.  This  also  applies  if  the member returns from leave on Sunday or a holiday. 4.1.2.  Advance  Leave.  Advance  leave  is  leave  granted  based  on  a  reasonable  expectation that a member will accrue leave during the remaining period of active military service. 4.1.2.1.  Purpose of Advance Leave.  The purpose of advance leave is to enable members to  resolve  emergencies  or  urgent  personal  situations  when  they  have  limited  or  no accrued leave.   Members may not depart on leave before the unit commander approves the advance leave.  Unit commanders may approve requests for members: 4.1.2.1.1.  Requesting  up  to  30  days  of  advance  leave  and  includes  leave  requests which, if approved, result in a negative leave balance of 30 or less days. 4.1.2.1.2.  Requesting up to 30 days of advance leave in connection with travel, either PCS  or  TDY,  including  a  consecutive  overseas  tour  (COT).    This  includes  leave requests which, if approved, result in a negative leave balance of 30 or less days. 4.1.2.1.3.  Completing technical training and requesting up to 10 days advance leave if the first duty station is in CONUS or up to 14 days if outside CONUS.  Note:   Unit commanders  normally  approve  the  lesser  of  30  days  or  the  amount  of  leave  the member will earn during the remaining period of active military service. 4.1.2.2.  Delegating  Approval.    Unit  commander  can  delegate  approval  to  a  level  no lower than squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalents.   For emergency leave situations, first sergeants can approve advance leave when delegated authority to approve emergency leave for enlisted members. 4.1.2.2.1.  At headquarters’ staff, commanders can delegate approval to no lower than assistant functional deputy directors or equivalents. 4.1.2.2.2.  AETC  training  commanders  can  delegate  approval  authority  to  no  lower than first sergeants for enlisted members. 4.1.2.3.  Thirty  Days  or  More  of  Advance  Leave.    HQ  AFPC/DP2SSM  is  the  approval authority.  Send  requests  for  advance  leave  when  members  have  already  taken  up  to  30 cumulative days of advance leave through the wing commander or FOA/A1 or equivalent (colonel  or  above)  for  a  recommendation  to  HQ  AFPC/DP2SSM,  550  C  Street  West, Joint Base San Antonio Randolph, TX 78150.  Include: 4.1.2.3.1.  Justification and recommendation for the leave requested. 4.1.2.3.2.  When the requested leave begins and ends. 4.1.2.3.3.  The number of advance leave days initially approved, if any. 4.1.2.3.4.  The  member's  leave  balance  at  the  beginning  of  the  initial  advance  leave approval. 4.1.2.3.5.  The number of days accruing to the expiration of term of service. 4.1.2.3.6.  The  number  of  additional  advance  days  requested.    Note:  For  immediate emergencies  or  urgent  personal  situations,  HQ  AFPC/DP2SSM  gives  telephonic approval  when  members  have  already  taken  up  to  30  cumulative  days  of  advance   22  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 leave  (DSN  665-2591  or  commercial  (210)  565-2591).    First  Sergeants  ensure  Unit Leave Monitor completes the AF Form 988 and follows up with a message or e-mail within 48 hours, with the information in 4.1.2.3.1 through 4.1.2.3.6 4.1.2.4.  Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO) Team.  The PERSCO Team  Chief  requests  approval  for  advance  leave  in  excess  of  30  days  from  HQ AFPC/DP2SSM and notifies the unit of assignment of the final decision. 4.1.2.5.  Advance  Leave  Becomes  Excess  Leave.      When  a  member  has  taken  all  the advance  leave  that  he  or  she  can  accrue  during  the  remaining  period  of  active  service, unit commanders change member’s leave status from advance to excess leave. Members carry forward advance leave to a new period of service if an enlisted member separates and immediately reenlists 3 or more months before expiration of the term of service. 4.1.2.6.  Advance  Leave  Not  Authorized.      Unit  commanders  may  not  approve  advance leave: 4.1.2.6.1.  For  members  pending  administrative  or  punitive  actions  requiring  their separation at the earliest possible date. 4.1.2.6.2.  In  conjunction  with  excess  leave  authorized  for  members  awaiting punitive, administrative, or disability discharge. 4.1.2.7.  Advance  Leave  and  Excess  Leave.    When  authorizing  excess  leave  in conjunction  with  advance  leave,  advance  leave  does  not  accrue  during  the  period  of excess  leave  involved.  Example:    A  member  with  an  Expiration  of  Term  of  Service (ETS) of 15 Mar 16 requests 30 days leave effective 1 Oct 15.  The member has 2 days accrued  leave  through  30  Sep  15.    The  member  would  normally  accrue  14  days  during the period 1 Oct 15 - 15 Mar 16.  Therefore, the member would have a total of 16 days accrued and tentative advance leave through ETS.  The tentative excess leave period is 14 days (30 days requested leave minus 16 days accrued and tentative leave).  The member will not accrue 1.5 days during the tentative excess leave period. (T-1)Therefore, reduce the 14 days leave that would normally accrue by 1.5 days that will not accrue during the excess leave period (see Figure 4.1 below).  This results in advance leave of 12.5 days.  In  this  example,  the  authorized  leave  is  2  days  accrued  leave,  12.5  days  advance  leave, and 15.5 days excess leave. 4.1.2.8.  Indebtedness.   The Financial Services Office stops or collects, if applicable, all pay  and  allowances  paid  after  a  member's  leave  status  changes  from  advance  to  excess leave.  There is an additional collection for non-accruals of one half-day for every 6 days of excess leave (see Figure 4.1 below).  Note: See AFMAN 65-116, Volume 2, Chapter 7. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   23  Figure 4.1.  Non-Accrual Days.

Compute in 30-day increments. 4.1.3.  Emergency  Leave.  Emergency  leave  is  chargeable  leave  granted  for  personal  or family emergencies involving the immediate family.  See paragraph  4.1.3.10 for emergency leave requests, and paragraph 4.1.3.11 for travel situations.  See also AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty  Orders,  when  preparing  special  orders  for  emergency  leave  travel.  See  AFI  36-3020, Family Member Travel, for dependents who may be eligible for emergency travel allowances and when member is ineligible for emergency leave.  Emergency travel allowances are under the JTR, Chapters 5 and 7. 4.1.3.1.  Immediate  Family.  Immediate  family  consists  of  the  member's  spouse  and member’s or spouse's: 4.1.3.1.1.  Parents (including stepparents). 4.1.3.1.2.  Children (including illegitimate children and stepchildren). 4.1.3.1.3.  Brothers and sisters. 4.1.3.1.4.  Sole surviving blood relative. 4.1.3.1.5.  In loco parentis person (defined in paragraph 4.1.3.10, Table 4.2). 4.1.3.2.  Emergency Leave Approval.   Unit commanders approve initial emergency leave periods up to 30 days and extensions up to 30 days.   If a member has, or anticipates, a negative  leave  balance,  unit  commander  considers  only  that  leave  which  is  absolutely necessary  to  take  care  of  the  emergency  situation.  Note:  The  TDY  commander  or PERSCO  Team  Chief  approves  emergency  leave  after  notifying  and  receiving  approval from the unit of assignment. 4.1.3.3.  Delegating Emergency Leave Approval: 4.1.3.3.1.  Unit  commanders  can  delegate  approval  for  emergency  leave  for  enlisted members  to  a  level  no  lower  than  the  first  sergeant.    When  delegated  authority  to approve emergency leave for enlisted members, first sergeants can approve up to 30 days  advance  leave.    They  also  can  approve  excess  leave  when  the  combination  of accrued, advance, and excess leave is 60 days or less. 4.1.3.3.2.  At headquarters’ staff, commanders can delegate approval to no lower than assistant functional deputy directors or equivalents. 4.1.3.4.  HQ AFPC/DP2SSM Approval.  HQ AFPC/DP2SSM approves emergency leave:   24  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 4.1.3.4.1.  If leave requested results in a member having a cumulative negative leave balance of over 30 days. 4.1.3.4.2.  Exceeding  60  days  when  members  have  already  taken  advance  or  excess leaves. 4.1.3.5.  Unit Commander’s Responsibilities.  Unit commanders: 4.1.3.5.1.  Approve  or  deny  emergency  leave  on  a  case-by-case  basis  based  on  their knowledge of the circumstances. 4.1.3.5.2.  Who  have  reason  to  doubt  the  validity  of  an  emergency  situation,  may  request  assistance  from  the  military  Service  activity  nearest  the  location  of  the emergency  in  determining  the  validity  of  the  emergency  situation  and  the  necessity for    the    member’s    presence.        When  necessary,  unit  commanders  may  request assistance from the ARC to verify emergency situations. 4.1.3.5.3.  Approve initial periods of emergency leave for no more than 30 days and extensions for no more than 30 days. 4.1.3.5.4.  Advise members to apply for humanitarian or exceptional family member reassignment,  or  separation  for  hardship  reasons  if  the  leave  period  is  more  than  60 days. 4.1.3.5.5.  Send  emergency justification if leave requested results in a member: leave  requests to  HQ  AFPC/DP2SSM  with  full 4.1.3.5.5.1.  Having a cumulative negative balance of over 30 days. 4.1.3.5.5.2.  Taking    leave    for    60    or    more    days    and    member    has    already  taken advance or excess leave. 4.1.3.5.6.  Give  members  the  opportunity  to  apply  for  ordinary  leave,  reassignment, or separation for hardship reasons if they do not qualify for emergency leave. 4.1.3.5.7.  Do  not  deny  emergency  leave  solely  because  of  lack  of  funds  for  funded travel. 4.1.3.5.8.  Do  not  approve  emergency  leave  for  purpose  of  either  increasing  the member’s travel priority or offsetting personal travel costs. 4.1.3.5.9.  Ensure  members  contact  the  TMO  or  commercial  travel  office  (CTO)  for travel arrangements because failure to do so can result in non-reimbursement of travel costs. 4.1.3.6.  Advance Leave for Emergencies.  When members do not have sufficient accrued leave to take care of urgent personal or emergency situations: 4.1.3.6.1.  The unit commander approves the lesser of 30 days or the amount of leave the  member  accrues  during  the  remaining  period  of  active  military  service.    First sergeants can approve advance leave when delegated authority to approve emergency leave for enlisted members. 4.1.3.6.2.  HQ AFPC/DP2SSM approves advance leave for more than 30 days when members have already taken 30 cumulative days of advance leave. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   25  4.1.3.6.3.  The PERSCO Team Chief requests approval for advance leave in excess of 30  days  from  HQ  AFPC/DP2SSM  and  notifies  the  unit  of  assignment  of  the  final decision. 4.1.3.7.  Excess Leave for Emergencies.   When members use all advance leave that they have not yet earned: 4.1.3.7.1.  Unit  commanders  may  approve  excess  leave  when  the  combination  of ordinary,  advance,  and  excess  leave  is  60  days  or  less.    First  sergeants  can  approve excess  leave  when  delegated  authority  to  approve  emergency  leave  for  enlisted members. 4.1.3.7.2.  HQ    AFPC/DP2SSM  approves    excess    leave    when    members    have  already  taken  more  than  a  total  of  60  days  cumulative  leave  (ordinary,  advance, excess). 4.1.3.8.  Emergency Leave Extension. If an extension to emergency leave is necessary: 4.1.3.8.1.  Members contact the: 4.1.3.8.1.1.  Organization  commander  or  first  sergeant  (contact  the  losing- organization commander or first sergeant if on en route leave). 4.1.3.8.1.2.

For  headquarters’  staff,  commanders  delegate  leave  approval  to  no  lower than assistant functional deputy directors or equivalent.   30  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 4.1.5.3.  Commanders  Reporting  Directly  to  the  Chief  of  Staff,  Vice  Chief  of  Staff  or Assistant Vice Chief of Staff.  These commanders approve their own leave.  They send leave  notification  7  days  in  advance  by  message  to  HQ  USAF/CVA.    Include  in  the notification message: 4.1.5.3.1.  Effective date of leave requested. 4.1.5.3.2.  Duration. 4.1.5.3.3.  Leave address and telephone number. 4.1.5.3.4.  Name of acting commander.  Note: HQ USAF/CVA advises commanders when extenuating circumstances require adjustments to scheduled leaves. 4.1.5.4.  Disapproving or Denying Terminal Leave.  Unit commanders: 4.1.5.4.1.  May disapprove terminal leave for military necessity or in the best interest of the Air Force. 4.1.5.4.2.  Deny  terminal  leave  when  governing  separation  directives  require member’s separation at the earliest possible date. See paragraph 4.1.5.5.5 below. 4.1.5.4.3.  Deny terminal leave requested in conjunction with authorized PTDY when governing  separation  directives  require  member’s  separation  at  the  earliest  possible date. See paragraph 4.1.5.5.5 below. 4.1.5.5.  Terminal Leave Guidelines.  Unit Leave Monitors will: 4.1.5.5.1.  Limit members' absences to their leave balances. 4.1.5.5.2.  Do not normally allow members to return to duty after a leave begins. 4.1.5.5.3.  Limit  requests  for  excess  leave  to  emergency  situations.  See  paragraph 4.1.3.7. 4.1.5.5.4.  In  consultation  with  the  MPS,  ensure  members  complete  all  required separation or retirement processing and have orders in hand before starting leave. 4.1.5.5.5.  Advise  members  separating  under  “for  cause”  provisions  or  other separatees  required  to  separate  at  the  earliest  possible  date  that  the  FSO  calculates payment or forfeiture  of  accrued  leave  at  time  of  separation.    DoD  Regulation  7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Department of Defense Financial Management, Military Pay Policy  –  Active  Duty  and  Reserve  Pay,  governs  payment  of  accrued  leave.      Note:   Do not authorize terminal leave to “for cause” separatees authorized PTDY or excess leave or other separatees required to separate at the earliest possible date. 4.1.5.5.6.  Advise  members  they  cannot  use  half-days  and  that  terminal  leave  is scheduled so that it is continuous and ends on the date of separation. 4.1.5.5.7.  Advise  members  that  they  forfeit  unused  half-days  when  not  authorized payment for accrued leave. 4.1.6.  Environmental and Morale Leave (EML).  EML is leave authorized at an overseas installation where adverse environmental conditions require special arrangements for leave in desirable places at periodic intervals. The EML taken is ordinary leave. Unified commanders designate the authorized EML duty locations and destinations. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   31  4.1.6.1.  Purpose.      The  purpose  of  EML  is  to  make  use  of  DoD-owned  or    controlled aircraft  to  supplement  in-country  leave  schedules  established  to  carry  out  basic  leave programs. 4.1.6.2.  Funded EML.   Funded EML authorizes members DoD-owned or -controlled air transportation  from  EML  duty  locations  for  purposes  of  taking  leave  in  an  EML destination site. Do not charge leave for  member’s time spent en route to and returning from an EML destination site.    Charge  leave  for  the  period  of  time  at  the  EML destination  site.    Leave  begins  the  day  after  the  member  arrives  at  the  aerial  port  of debarkation  that  services  the  destination  site.    Leave  ends  the  day  before  the  member   See  JTR,  paragraph  7000,  FEML returns  to  the  aerial  port  of  embarkation. Transportation. 4.1.6.3.  Unfunded  EML.        Unfunded  EML  authorizes  members  space-available  air transportation  from  EML  duty  locations  for  purposes  of  taking  leave  in  an  EML destination site.  Charge leave for travel time to and from, and for the period of time at an EML  destination  site  when  traveling  on  a  space-available  basis.    The  MAJCOM/A1 equivalent  or  designee  grants  extensions  for  unfunded  EML.      Any  leave-approving authority  within  the  chain  of  command  can  deny  requests  without  referring  them  to  a higher-level headquarters. 4.1.6.4.  Required Travel Documents.  When traveling  outside  the United States, ensure member checks AFI 16-606, Foreign Clearance Program, for required travel documents.   Instruct members to comply with foreign government procedures as required by AFI 16-606, to include the DoD Travel Security Advisory. The passport/visa section in the MPS maintains a copy of the guide and advisory. 4.2.  Non-chargeable  leave.  The  following  types  of  leave  are  not  chargeable  toward  the member’s annual leave balance: 4.2.1.  Convalescent  Leave.  Convalescent  leave  is  an  authorized  absence  normally  for  the minimal time essential to meet the medical needs for recuperation.  The Air Force Surgeon General oversees the convalescent leave program. 4.2.1.1.  Convalescent  Leave  Approval.          The  unit  commander  normally  approves convalescent leave, to include any associated and cleared travel, up to 30 days based on the  recommendations  by  either  the  MTF  authority  or  the  attending  physician  most familiar  with  the  member’s  medical  condition.  The    commander    must    not    approve  more    than    30    days    initial    convalescent    leave.  (T-3)    Extending  convalescent  leave beyond  30  days  requires  additional  medical  review  and  consent.   Exception: Convalescent leave due to pregnancy or childbirth.    Note: During short absences of the unit  commander,  the  commander’s  designated  representative  may  approve  convalescent leave. 4.2.1.1.1.  Absence  from  duty  because  of  pregnancy  and  childbirth.    During pregnancy, members continue to perform normal duties as long as they are medically fit  to  do  so.  When  it  is  necessary  for  the  member's  or  fetus'  health  and  safety, convalescent  leave  is  appropriate  as  long  as  it  is  medically  required.    For  childbirth where  member  retains  the  child(ren),  postpartum  Maternity  leave  following  normal pregnancy is 84 days.  Maternity leave begins the day of discharge from the medical   32  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 treatment facility or following a birth event (whichever is later) and continues through the  end  of  the  84-day  period,  unless  otherwise  extended  by  a  physician.    Medical authorities determine whether the member’s medical condition warrants convalescent leave beyond 84 days.  Members may elect to return to work prior to the end of the authorized 84-day period; however, all remaining days will be forfeited.  Note:  For a member  who  gives  birth  but  does  not  retain  the  child(ren),  medical  authorities  will prescribe convalescent leave consistent with AFI 41-210. 4.2.1.1.1.1.      In  the  case  of  dual-military  couples,  Maternity  Leave  under  this instruction may not be “transferred” to create any kind of shared benefit. 4.2.1.1.1.2.  Maternity  Leave  policy  applies  to  active  component  Airmen,  and Reserve  Component  Airmen  serving  on  call  or  order  to  active  service  for  a continuous  period  of  at  least  12  months.      In  all  cases,  unused  Maternity  Leave will be forfeited upon separation from active service. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   33  Table 4.3.  Convalescent Leave Requests.

Note: If member does not retain child, convalescent leave is prescribed IAW AFI 41-210. normally approves the number of days that the attending physician deems necessary for the member’s or fetus’ health and safety. normally approves the number of days that the attending physician deems necessary, not to exceed 30 days. MTF service chief or department chairman normally approves up to 30 days that the attending physician deems necessary.  MTF commander may approve more than 30 but less than 90 days.  More than 90 days requires MAJCOM/SGP approval. (T-3) Army or Navy MTF commander or VA Director normally approves up to 30 days that the attending physician deems necessary. Continued convalescent requires additional medical review. (T-0) normally approves the number of days that the attending physician deems necessary, not to exceed 30 days. cannot approve.  Comment: Members take ordinary leave to cover the period of absence.  The period of absence includes the time actually spent as an inpatient in a civilian hospital and any convalescent period deemed necessary by the attending physician. 9  paid for medical procedure which Air Force MTF medical authority determined member did not require is subsequently treated at an Air Force MTF after experiencing complications normally approves the number of days that the attending physician deems necessary, not to exceed 30 days.   34  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 4.2.1.2.  Medical Authority.  The medical authority or attending physician determines: 4.2.1.2.1.  When a medical condition warrants continuance of convalescent leave. 4.2.1.2.2.  Whether the member can depart the local area while on convalescent leave. 4.2.1.3.  Convalescent  Begins.      Convalescent  leave  begins  the  day  of  release  from  the medical  treatment  facility  and  continues  through  the  day  before  the  member’s  return  to duty, if applicable, or return to in-hospital status. 4.2.1.4.  Voluntary  Termination.    A  member  may  voluntarily  terminate  convalescent leave earlier with the attending physician approval. 4.2.1.5.  Requesting  Ordinary  Leave.        A  member  may  request  ordinary  leave  after completing convalescent leave. 4.2.1.6.  Terminating  Convalescent  Leave.   The  unit  commander  may  terminate convalescent  leave  status  if  the  member’s  continued  absence  from  duty  would  clearly have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  readiness  or  operational  mission  of  the  unit.    The  unit commander  must  consult  the  cognizant  military  health  authority  to  determine  whether such action is medically advisable prior to terminating convalescent leave. (T-3) 4.2.2.  Excess  Leave.  Excess  leave  is  leave  members  normally  use  for  personal  or  family emergency  situations  when  members  cannot  request  advance  leave.    Excess  leave  is  a  no- pay status; therefore, authority for pay and allowances and leave accrual stops on member’s first day of excess leave. 4.2.2.1.  Unit  Commanders  or  Designees  with  General  or  Special  Court-Martial Convening Authority: 4.2.2.1.1.  Approve or deny members’ requests for excess leave. 4.2.2.1.2.  If approving excess leave, advise members to use all accrued leave first. 4.2.2.1.3.  Advise  members  excess  leave  begins  the  day  after  accrued  leave  ends. Note:  When  unit  commanders  send  requests  recommending  approval  through  the chain  of  command,  any  approval  authority  in  the  chain  may  subsequently  deny  the requests. 4.2.2.2.  Convening  Authority  Directing  Appellate  Review  Leave.        When  directing appellate review leave, approve travel according to the JTR, paragraph 7635G, Convicted Personnel  Awaiting  Completion  of  Appellate  Review,  and  AFI  36-2102,  Base-Level Relocation Procedures, and advise members they may take either: 4.2.2.2.1.  Ordinary leave and then excess leave. 4.2.2.2.2.  Payment for accrued leave (if authorized) and then excess leave. 4.2.2.2.3.  Some    ordinary    leave,    payment    for    remaining    accrued    leave,    and  excess leave. 4.2.2.3.  Involuntary Excess Leave.  With the concurrence of the Show Cause Authority concerned,  commanders  may  place  on  involuntary  excess  leave,  regular  officers recommended  for  discharge  (i.e.,  not  recommended  for  retention  on  active  duty)  by  a Board of Inquiry “Show Cause Board.”  The officer may be required to begin such leave AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   35  at any time following the officer's receipt of the report of the board of inquiry including the  board's  recommendation  for  discharge/removal  from  active  duty,  and  the  expiration of any period allowed for submission by the officer of a rebuttal to that report.  The leave may  be  continued  until  the  date  on  which  action  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (or his/her  designee,  normally  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  Personnel  Council)  on  the officer's case is completed or may be terminated at an earlier time. 4.2.2.4.  Reverting  to  Pay  Status  from  Appellate  Review  Leave.    For  overruled  or  set-aside court-martial sentences, members: 4.2.2.4.1.  Qualify for pay and allowances for excess leave taken when directed by the unit commander. 4.2.2.4.2.  Do not qualify for pay and allowances for voluntary excess leave taken. 4.2.2.4.3.  Do not get credit for accrued leave for which they elected payment before departing on appellate-review leave. 4.2.2.5.  Excess Leave Periods.  Unit commanders advise members: 4.2.2.5.1.  Excess leave is leave without pay and allowances, and they do not receive disability pay, if injured, for time spent on excess leave. 4.2.2.5.2.  The  FSO  stops  all  pay  and  allowances  effective  the  first  day  of  excess leave. The FSO collects, if applicable, any pay and allowances paid.   When members separate  from  active  duty,  there  is  an  additional  collection  for  non-accrual  of  leave resulting from periods of excess leave. This is one half-day for each six-day period of excess leave. 4.2.2.6.  The following table explains voluntary excess leave requests. R U L E 1 for an emergency or urgent personal situation 2  3 for separation or retirement relocation activities such as job search and is eligible under AFI 36-3009, Airman and Family Readiness Centers, as a: (1) Voluntary separation incentive separatee.

Under AFI 36-3206, para 4.8 the Show Cause Authority may grant an officer’s request for excess leave.  Note:  Leave is authorized for members who complete administrative discharge proceedings while awaiting a final grade determination. Advise members they can retain their leave balance up to 60 days. Approve when you no longer need the member there and when the member meets medical criteria for separation.  When reviewing requests, any approving authority may deny leave based on military necessity or in the best interests of the Air Force.  6 as an officer resigning in lieu of court martial the wing commander or FOA/A1 may approve unlimited days in 60-day increments. If applicable approve when: (1) You no longer need the member there, (2) The member meets medical criteria for separation, and (3) The member serves all adjudged confinement, or (4) You or another authority figure commutes, remits, suspends, or defers the member’s sentence.

Excess leave begins after ordinary leave. (1) Any level may deny the application if it does not meet the defined requirements or if determined not to be in the best interest of the Air Force. (2) Advance and excess leave may not be used prior to receiving approval under this program. 4.2.2.7.  Requesting  Excess  Leave.    Before  requesting  excess  leave,  review  paragraph 4.2.2 and Table 4.4  The member submits request  through  channels  to  the  appropriate commander or the appropriate court marital convening authority, as applicable.  Include the following applicable statements: 4.2.2.7.1.  I hereby request excess leave under AFI 36-3003, Table 4.4, Rule       . 4.2.2.7.2.  I  understand  I  may  have  to  use  my  accrued  leave  before  entering  excess leave status. 4.2.2.7.3.  I understand excess leave is a no-pay status; therefore, I will not accrue any pay and allowances while on excess leave. 4.2.2.7.4.  I  understand  I  am  eligible  for  medical  care  and  use  of  other  military facilities while I am in an excess leave status. 4.2.2.7.5.  I  understand  I  will  not  receive  disability  pay  if  injured  for  time  spent  on excess leave. 4.2.2.7.6.  I understand the FSO stops all pay and allowances effective the first day of excess leave. 4.2.2.7.7.  I understand the FSO collects, if applicable, any pay and allowances. 4.2.2.7.8.  I  understand  there  is  a  collection  for  non-accrual  of  leave  resulting  from periods  of  excess leave upon  separation  from  active  duty.     This  is  one half-day  for each six-day period of excess leave. 4.2.2.7.9.  I  understand  that  the  period  of  excess  leave  will  not  count  toward  the fulfillment of any active duty service commitment. 4.2.2.8.  Excess  Leave  to  Pursue  Activities  with  Potential  Recruiting  or  Public  Affairs Benefit  to  the  Department  of  the  Air  Force.    Officers  and  enlisted  Airmen  may  request excess leave to pursue other career opportunities.  Such requests can be made for, but are not  limited  to,  pursuing  careers  in  professional  sports,  music  contracts,  or  other professions in which there is a strong expectation of the Air Force receiving a recruiting or public affairs benefit.  Airmen are expected to use their talent primarily in the United AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   39  States  in  a  manner  that  generates  significant  favorable  media  coverage  and  likely generates  interest  in  service  in  the  United  States  Air  Force.      Evaluation  of  requests considers the needs of the Air Force, the quality of the professional performance to date, the strength of the public affairs or recruiting proposal, and potential positive recruiting or  public  affairs  benefit  to  the  Air  Force.    In  addition,  in  making  a  recommendation  or decision  on  an  application,  reviewing  authorities  should  consider  that  Airmen  in  excess leave  under  this  provision  are  in  effect  “ambassadors”  of  the  Air  Force  and  any determination  should  consider  whether  an  Airman’s records  and  service  history,  to include derogatory or disciplinary action, render him or her an inappropriate candidate. 4.2.2.8.1.  The  approval  authority  for  this  program  is  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the Air  Force,  Manpower  and  Reserve  Affairs  (SAF/MR).      The  Airman  requesting excess leave  must  make  the  application  by  memorandum,  endorsed  by  the  wing  or equivalent commander and sent through AFPC/DPSOS to SAF/MR for approval. (T-2)  Any level in the process may disapprove the application if it does not meet the defined requirements or if determined not to be in the best interest of the Air Force. 4.2.2.8.2.  Airmen may apply for excess leave not to exceed one year.   Excess leave cannot begin until the Airman has served at least 24 months on active duty. 4.2.2.8.3.  While in excess leave status, Airmen may be recalled to active duty so they must  maintain  contact  information  with  the  commander  responsible  for  monitoring the Airman’s progress. (T-2) 4.2.2.8.4.  The Airman must meet physical fitness requirements and standards. (T-2) 4.2.2.8.5.  The Airman must have secured a contract or binding commitment with an organization  guaranteeing  the  opportunity  to  pursue  an  activity  with  potential recruiting benefits. (T-2) 4.2.2.8.6.  Airmen  enter  into  a  non-pay  status  and  are  not  authorized  pay  and allowances while in excess leave status.  Airmen who incur a physical disability while in  excess  leave  status  are  not  authorized  to  receive  disability  retired  pay.    As  a condition  of  approval  of  this  extraordinary  excess  leave  and  consistent  with  past practice, Airmen are required to acquire private disability insurance. (T-2) 4.2.2.8.7.  Airmen in excess leave status for this purpose must acknowledge that time served  in  excess  leave  is  not  used  to  satisfy  an  existing  active  duty  service commitment. (T-2) 4.2.3.  Permissive  TDY  (PTDY).  This  section  describes  PTDY,  an  administrative  absence under DoD Instruction 1327.06, Leave and Liberty Policy and Procedures, for which funded TDY is not proper.  PTDY is non-chargeable leave.  The lack of official TDY funds is not a reason to grant PTDY. 4.2.3.1.  General  Information.  PTDY  is  an  authorized  absence  limited  to  reasons  in Table 4.5 below. Unit commanders may not authorize PTDY in place of leave or special pass nor in conjunction with special passes, or for reasons in paragraph 4.2.3.7 4.2.3.2.  Commander PTDY Approval: 4.2.3.2.1.  Ensure the reason for PTDY is outlined in the specific rules in Table 4.5   40  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 4.2.3.2.2.  Do not approve PTDY to conduct official business for which funded TDY is appropriate. 4.2.3.2.3.  Do not authorize PTDY in place of leave or special pass, or in conjunction with a special pass. 4.2.3.2.4.  Judiciously  approve  PTDY  consistent  with  organizational  mission  needs and the actual time necessary to complete the PTDY. 4.2.3.2.5.  May  authorize  PTDY  in  conjunction  with  ordinary  leave.  This  requires separate AF Form 988s.  The ordinary leave start date must begin the next calendar day after termination of PTDY.  If ordinary leave is taken prior to PTDY, the end date must  be  the  calendar  day  prior  to  the  PTDY  start  date.    The  combination  of  leaves will serve as one leave period. 4.2.3.2.6.  May authorize PTDY with TDY.  This requires an AF Form 988. 4.2.3.2.7.  Charge leave for any additional absence beyond the approved PTDY. 4.2.3.2.8.  May  deny  PTDY  requests  without  referring  them  to  higher-level headquarters. 4.2.3.2.9.  Do not grant PTDY for reasons in paragraph 4.2.3.7 4.2.3.2.10.  Unit  commanders  may  delegate  approval  authority  to  no  lower  than deputies or equivalents. 4.2.3.2.11.  For  headquarters’  staff,  commanders  may  delegate  approval  to  no  lower than functional deputy directors or equivalents. 4.2.3.2.12.  When a specific time period is provided for in Table 4.5: 4.2.3.2.12.1.  Unit commanders (or equivalents) may approve the period of PTDY up to that specified in the table. 4.2.3.2.12.2.  Commanders  at  all  levels  are  not  authorized  to  approve  PTDY  in excess of that allowed for by Table 4.5. 4.2.3.2.13.  When a specific time period is not provided for in Table 4.5: 4.2.3.2.13.1.

Note:  For an extension beyond the authorized pass period, a Servicemember shall be charged leave for the entire period if the absence exceeds 3 days and is deemed unauthorized and avoidable.  For unavoidable circumstances, a Servicemember will be charged leave only for those days beyond the authorized pass period. 5.2.  Regular Pass. 5.2.1.  A regular pass (liberty) starts after normal working hours on a given day and stops at the beginning of normal working hours on the next working day. 5.2.2.  A regular pass normally begins at the end of working hours on Friday afternoon until the  beginning  of  normal  working  hours  on  the  following  Monday  when  non-duty  days  are Saturday and Sunday. 5.2.3.  A  regular  pass  period  (non-duty  days)  for  units  on  non-traditional  work  schedules (alternate or compressed work schedules) may not exceed the 4-day special pass limitation.  The  combination  of  non-duty  days  and  a  public  holiday  may  not  exceed  the  4-  day  special pass  limitation.

A    DoD    Management    Headquarters    or    Headquarters    Supporting    Activity,    as defined  in  DoD  Instruction  5100.73,  Major  DoD  Headquarters  Activities,  determines whether Monday or Friday is compensatory time off with a holiday observed on a Tuesday or Thursday.   An authorized 4-day holiday period consisting of a holiday, compensatory time off  day,  and  a  weekend  is  a  regular  pass  period.    For  the  purpose  of  this  AFI,  major  DoD Headquarters Activities refer to the MAJCOMs and equivalents. 5.3.  Special Pass.  Unit commanders may award 3- or 4-day special passes for special occasions or circumstances, such as reenlistment or for some type of special recognition or compensatory time  off.      They  may  delegate  approval  to  a  level  no  lower  than  squadron  section  commander, deputies, or equivalents.  Special passes start after normal working hours on a given day.  They stop at the beginning of normal working hours on either the 4th day for a 3-day special pass or the  5th  day  for  a  4-day  special  pass.      A  3-day  special  pass  can  be  Friday  through  Sunday, Saturday through Monday, or Tuesday through Thursday.  A 4-day special pass can be Thursday through  Sunday  or  Saturday  through  Tuesday  or  Friday  through  Monday.  This  applies  to  a normal Monday through Friday workweek.

At  training  bases,  commanders  can  require members  to  be  able  to  return  in  time  to  resume  training  or  class  attendance.    Commanders need to base all restrictions on reasonable and legitimate military requirements.   52  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 5.4.2.  Inform members that the authorized absence that exceeds the pass period is chargeable leave if they fail to return from an authorized pass period. 5.4.3.

Overview.  This chapter describes the SLA provisions when deployments or assignments to a  hostile-fire  or  imminent-danger  pay  area  prohibit  members  from  using  leave.    The  SLA  also applies when deployments or assignments to designated operational missions at the national level prohibit members from using leave. It provides information on restoring leave lost at the end of the Fiscal Year when permitted by Congress. 6.1.1.  SLA Provisions: 6.1.1.1.  Leave in Excess of 60 Days at the End of the Fiscal Year.  SLA allows members in qualifying duties to accumulate leave in excess of 60 days.  Furthermore, it should be a result of the members’ inability to take leave or to reduce their leave balance to 60 days before the end of the fiscal year while being assigned to said activities.  SLA shall not be used  as  a  means  to  authorize  the  accumulation  of  leave  in  excess  of  60  days  that  is  a result of members’ failure to properly manage their leave balance. 6.1.2.  SLA  Eligibility.  A member may not carry forward a leave balance of more than 60 days into a new fiscal year, except when entitled to SLA, as outlined below: 6.1.2.1.  A  member  who  serves  on  active  duty  while  entitled  to  hostile  fire/imminent danger  pay  (HFP/IDP)  for  a  continuous  period  of  at  least  120  days  are  authorized  to retain such leave (not to exceed 120 days) until the end of the third fiscal year following the fiscal year in which SLA was lost. 6.1.2.1.1.  The situation preventing members from using leave must have been caused by a catastrophe, national emergency and/or crisis or operations in defense of national security. 6.1.2.2.  Members  assigned  to  a  non-HFP  and/or  non-IDP  area  in  support  of  a contingency  operation  who  are  on  CED  orders  (and  in  rare  cases,  1610  orders)  are authorized  to  retain  such  leave  up  to  120  days  until  the  end  of  the  second  fiscal  year following the fiscal year in which SLA was lost. 6.1.3.  Restoring  Leave  Lost  on  1  Oct.  The  maximum  amount  of  SLA  leave  that  may  be carried forward is the leave balance at the end of the fiscal year following the end of the SLA qualifying period not to exceed 120 days. 6.1.3.1.  The  maximum  amount  will  be  reduced  to  a  new  level  whenever  the  leave balance drops below the previously set level. If, at any time, the leave balance drops to or goes  below  60  days,  then  there  is  no  longer  any  SLA  protected  leave.  Therefore,  the actual  maximum  leave  that  can  be  carried  forward  into  succeeding  fiscal  years  is  the lowest leave balance achieved following the completion of the SLA duty or the usual 60 days, whichever is greater. 6.1.3.2.  If the SLA qualifying period crosses a fiscal year, then the entire leave balance (not  to  exceed  120  days)  will  be  carried  forward  and  the  leave  accrued  from  the beginning  of  the  new  fiscal  year  through  the  end  of  the  SLA  qualifying  period  will  be added  to  establish  the  maximum.  Only  that  portion  of  a  leave  balance  in  excess  of  60   54  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 days  which  could  not  have  been  taken  before  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  because  the member was assigned to SLA qualifying duty will be included in the carryover amount.  Example:  On August 31, 2007, a member had a leave balance of 80 days.  On September 15,  2007,  he  was  assigned  to  duty  qualifying  for  SLA.    Had  the  member  not  been assigned  to  SLA  duty,  he  could  have  possibly  taken  15  days  leave  from  September  16 through  September  30.    If  the  member  had  taken  leave  during  this  period,  then  there would  still have  been  a  loss  of  7.5 days  (82.5  days  accrued  through  September  30,  less the 15 days  potentially taken and the normal 60-day carryover restriction)  at the end of the fiscal year.  Therefore, since only the portion that potentially could have been taken is protected, the member may carry forward 75 days and will lose 7.5 days of leave. 6.1.4.  Effective Date of SLA.  Refer to the AFPC SLA message for effective and other key dates.  Note:  Last approved period of SLA was for 75 days from October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2015. 6.1.5.  Submitting  SLA  Requests.  Refer  to  the  Leave  PSD  Guide  for  processing procedures. 6.1.6.  SLA  Approval  Authority.  The  Wing/CC  or  Wing/CV  has  the  final  authority  and may be delegated no lower than the first O-6 in chain of command.  Additionally, the first O-6  in  chain  of  command  will  recommend  approval  for  SLA  packages  requiring  AFBCMR approval.    At  other  organizations  (i.e.  Air  Staff,  MAJCOM,  FOA,  DRU)  the  senior  officer representative (O-6 and above) or equivalent at the directorate level approves SLA for his/her organization.    At  joint  organizations,  the  senior  Air  Force  officer  representative  on  staff approves SLA for members assigned to units, headquarters, and supporting staffs. 6.1.7.  SLA Disapproval.  Any commander in the chain of command may deny a member’s request  for  SLA  without  referring  it  to  a  higher-level  authority  when  the  member’s  request does not meet the criteria for SLA consideration. 6.1.8.  SLA Not Authorized.  Members are ineligible for SLA when the following precludes using leave: 6.1.8.1.  Normal PCS moves and TDYs. 6.1.8.2.  Base closures. 6.1.8.3.  Hospitalizations, aeromedical evacuations, quarters, and convalescent leaves. 6.1.8.4.  Details and special working groups. 6.1.8.5.  Training exercises, attending schools or courses, and research requirements. 6.1.8.6.  Pending separations and retirements. 6.1.8.7.  Workload after return from deployment and members did not take leave before 1 Oct. 6.1.8.8.  Post-Deployment Recovery Time. 6.1.8.9.  Post deployment/mobilization respite absence (PDMRA). 6.1.9.  Members  not  eligible  for  SLA,  for  the  reasons  listed  in  paragraph  6.1.8,  can  request recovery of days lost by submitting a DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Records  under  the  Provisions  of  Title  10,  U.S.  Code  Section  1552.  See  AFI  36-2603.  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   55  Member’s application clearly establishes that an error or injustice by the Air Force caused the member’s lost leave.  If the Board restores leave to current leave account, members must use these days before the end of the current FY. (T-3)   56  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 Chapter 7 UNIQUE LEAVE PROVISIONS 7.1.  IPCOT.  IPCOT refers to members assigned to a consecutive tour at the same overseas duty station.  Members cannot initiate the travel until they have entered the new IPCOT tour, and have until  the  end  of  the  IPCOT  tour  to  use  the  travel  and  transportation  allowances,  otherwise  the authority  expires.      The  leave  taken  is  ordinary  leave  charged  based  on  authorized  allowable travel.  See paragraph 7.4 for exception to the end of tour limitation when members are unable to use the travel due to duty in connection with a contingency operation. 7.2.  Deferred  COT.  Deferred COT refers to members unable to use the COT leave travel and transportation allowances between the two tours because of military necessity, or when requested by  member  and  approved  for  COT  leave  deferment.  Members  have  until  the  end  of  their  new tour to use the COT leave travel and transportation allowances, otherwise the authority expires. The  leave  taken  is  ordinary  leave  charged  based  on  authorized  allowable  travel  time.    See paragraph  7.4  for  exception  to  the  end  of  tour  limitation  when  members  are  unable  to  use  the travel due to duty in connection with a contingency operation. 7.3.  Determining Deferred COT Allowance. 7.3.1.  Review the member’s PCS orders for deferred COT transportation.  The orders should  contain    the    authorization    to    defer    the    COT    transportation    allowance    and    the authorization (if applicable) to take leave (non-COT) en route.  The losing commander is the approval authority to approve the deferred COT allowance and non-COT leave en route.  If there  is  no  authorization  to  defer  the  COT  authority  on  the  orders,  consider  the  COT allowance used.  If the orders authorize deferred COT, check with the FSO to determine the number of chargeable leave days taken en route. Effective 1 Dec 98, the non-COT leave en route cannot exceed 10 days.  If the member took at least 11 days chargeable leave en route, consider  the  COT  allowance  used.    Note:    If  a  member  takes  greater  than  10  days  of  non-chargeable leave en route (e.g. PTDY as a participant in Recruiters Assistance Program and transportation  is  at  member’s  expense),  the  deferred  COT  opportunity  is  still  available  to member to use at a later date. 7.3.2.  If the authorization for the deferred COT transportation is on the orders but the FSO determines  member  took  more  than  10  days  non-COT  leave  en  route,  consider  the  COT opportunity  used.  The  member  may  request  reinstatement  of  the  authority  by  submitting    a  request  for  a  review  of  circumstances  to  HQ  USAF/A1PA  through command channels.    If  the  leave  en  route  exceeds  the  10-day  limitation  due  to  reasons  beyond  the  member’s control, the member may request a review of circumstances.  The member  must  submit  a  written  request  through  the  chain  of  command  to  HQ USAF/A1PA, 1500 W. Perimeter Rd, Suite 4780, Joint Base Andrews, MD 20762. (T-2)  If the determination is made that the member did not use the deferred COT, the member is required to reimburse the government for PCS COT leave travel payments made on the PCS voucher. (T-2) 7.4.  Scheduling Travel.  The unit works with the member to schedule the IPCOT or COT travel and makes sure the member uses the travel opportunity.  Since the IPCOT and COT travel is a statutory  allowance,  members  forfeit  this  opportunity  if  not  used  within  the  specified  period AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   57  covered in para 7.4.1 or 7.4.2 below.   Use the DD Form 1610 for COT, deferred COT or IPCOT travel. 7.4.1.  Scheduling IPCOT Leave Travel.  A member cannot initiate the travel until they have entered  the  new  IPCOT  tour  and  has  until  the  end  of  the  IPCOT  tour  to  use  the  travel  and transportation allowances.  Otherwise the allowance expires. 7.4.2.  Scheduling  Deferred  COT  Leave  Travel.      When  a  member  arrives  at  the  new  duty station, PCS orders should show member authorized deferred COT.  Members have until the end of their new tour to use the COT leave travel and transportation allowances. Otherwise the allowance expires.   Note:  If the determination is made that the member did not use the deferred  COT,  the  member  is  required  to  reimburse  the  government  for  PCS  COT  leave travel payments made on the PCS voucher. 7.4.3.  Exception  to  End  of  Tour  Limitation.      Members  unable  to  use  the  authority  before completing  the  new  tour  due  to  duty  in  connection  with  contingency  operations  may  defer travel until not more than 1 year after the completion of the duties precluding travel.  In this case,  the  member  is  still  authorized  to  leave  travel  from  the  new  Permanent  Duty  Station (PDS) (i.e., the PDS after departure from the OCONUS location from which deferred travel could  not  be  taken)  to  an  authorized  location.  The  cost  limitation  for  travel  from  this  new PDS and return is the cost from the PDS from which deferred travel could not be taken to the HOR  and  return.      Note:    The  additional  deferment  based  solely  on  duty  performed  in connection  with  a  contingency  operation  is  a  one-time  additional  authority  and  cannot  be further  extended.      If    members    do    not    qualify    for  an    extension    based    on    duty    in connection with a contingency operation, they may submit a DD Form 149,  Application for Correction  of  Military  Records  Under  the  Provisions  of  Title  10,  U.S.  Code  Section  1552.  See  AFI  36-2603.    Member’s  application  establishes  that  an  error  or  injustice  by  the  Air Force prevented the member from using the authority within the specified time frame. 7.4.4.  Ensure members contact TMO/CTO for travel arrangements because failure to do so can result in non-reimbursement of travel costs.  Comments: The JTR authorizes travel and transportation allowances to  members in  connection  with  authorized leave from, and return to, the overseas duty station.  The JTR, paragraph 7060, COT Leave, explains the allowances for  members  and  their  command-sponsored  dependents  who  travel  from  the  overseas  duty station  to  the  home  of  record  (HOR)  or  place  of  residence  and  return.  The  government reimburses authorized travel and transportation expenses. 7.5.  COT  or  IPCOT  Designated  Places.  An  authorized  destination  is  the  member’s  HOR  or an alternate authorized place to which travel is no more expensive than to the HOR.  If travel to the selected alternate place is more expensive than travel to the HOR, the member is financially responsible  for  the  additional  cost  unless  travel  to  the  more  expensive  alternate  place  is authorized/approved  by  the  Secretarial  Process.        If  the  member  travels  to  a  more  expensive alternate place (and the Secretarial Process has not authorized/approved travel to that destination) city-pair airfares are not authorized to that alternate place. 7.5.1.  Commanders send requests for travel via a designated place or alternate location with COT or IPCOT travel through HQ AFPC/DP3SA to HQ USAF/A1PA, IAW JTR, paragraphs 7060-D.4, Designated Place and 5052, Travel to/from a Designated Place.   58  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 7.5.2.  HQ  USAF/A1PA  normally  recommends  approval  on  applications  forwarded  for  a Secretarial determination on travel to an alternate location IAW JTR, paragraph 7060,  COT Leave  and  5052,  Travel  to/from  a  Designated  Place      (Example:  members  who  have  an overseas HOR want to visit family members in CONUS). 7.6.  SR&R  or  OTEIP.  Another  name  for  SR&R  is  OTEIP  as  described  in  AFI  36-2110, Assignments.    OTEIP  is  non-chargeable  leave  authorized  in  lieu  of  special  pay  for  certain enlisted  members  who  voluntarily  extend  their  tour  at  designated  overseas  locations  under  the OTEIP Y2 or Y3 option. 7.6.1.  OTEIP  Eligibility  Requirements.    Eligibility  requirements  are  in  AFI  36-2110. Eligible  members  agree  to  extend  at  a  designated  overseas  location  for  a  period  of  exactly one year. 7.6.2.  OTEIP Leave Options: 7.6.2.1.  Thirty-day non-chargeable leave (Y2).  Use AF Form 988 for this option. 7.6.2.2.  Fifteen-day  non-chargeable  leave  and  round-trip  transportation  at  Government expense  for  the  military  member  only  (Y3).    This  applies  to  travel  from  the  designated overseas location to the nearest CONUS port and return.  Dependents are not authorized travel  under  this  incentive.    The  FSO  uses  the  AF  Form  985,  Report  of  Travel Time/Leave, to determine chargeable leave based on authorized allowable travel time. 7.6.2.3.  Since  the  OTEIP  leave  option  is  a  statutory  authority,  members  forfeit  their leave options if not used within 12 months after entering the extension. 7.6.3.  OTEIP  Leave  Time  Frame.    Members  normally  use  the  15-  or  30-day  leave  in  one increment  within  6  months  after  the  effective  date  of  extension.    See  paragraph  7.6.4.3  for exception due to military requirements. 7.6.4.  OTEIP Approval.  Commanders: 7.6.4.1.  Approve  30-day  option  (Y2)  and  15-day  option  (Y3)  leave  requests  within  6 months after the member’s effective date of extension. 7.6.4.2.  May not approve OTEIP for banking or en route leave with a member’s PCS. 7.6.4.3.  May  waive  the  6-month  requirement  if  a  member  is  unable  to  take  the  OTEIP within  6  months  after  the  effective  date  of  extension  because  of  military  requirements.  Set the time frame for member to take OTEIP prior to expiration of extension. 7.6.4.4.  Can  approve  the  30-day  option  in  conjunction  with  valid  TDY  and  emergency leave, but not with ordinary leave, special passes or PTDY. 7.6.4.5.  May approve up to 15 days ordinary leave in conjunction with the 15-day option. 7.6.4.6.  Cannot  approve  15-  or  30-day  option  in  conjunction  with  reassignment  or  in conjunction with retirement or separation from active duty. 7.7.  Use  the  DD  Form  1610  for  15  days  of  OTEIP.  See  the  JTR,  paragraph  7650,  Aviation Cadet, for transportation in conjunction with this non-chargeable leave. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   59  7.8.  Rest  and  Recuperation  (R&R).  R&R programs are for members in a designated hostile-fire or imminent-danger pay area when military necessity restricts the annual leave program and the use of ordinary leave. 7.8.1.  The Assistant Secretary of Defense approves R&R programs. 7.8.2.  MAJCOMs submit requests to HQ USAF/A1PA, 1500 W. Perimeter Rd, Suite 4780, Joint  Base  Andrews,  MD  20762,  to  establish  R&R  leave  programs  for  units  in  their command that meet DoD criteria. 7.8.3.  HQ  USAF/A1P  works  with  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  to  coordinate MAJCOM requests for R&R leave programs. 7.8.4.  R&R Program Management.   Unified commanders manage R&R programs for their theaters of operation. 7.8.5.  Members  are  authorized  transportation  on  a  space-available  basis  to  and  from designated R&R areas. 7.8.6.  The travel time to and from R&R areas is not chargeable leave. 7.8.7.  R&R chargeable leave periods limited to 1 per 12-month period. 7.8.8.  Members  cannot  combine  R&R  leave  with  pass,  PTDY,  TDY,  or  travel  for  other purposes. 7.9.  Recruiter Assistance Program (RAP).  HQ Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS) oversees RAP.  See  the  local  recruiting  squadron  and  the  Recruiter  Assistance  Program  Operations Handbook  for  detailed  instructions  and  guidance.  If  you  need  additional  guidance,  contact AFRS/RSOAP, at DSN 665-0381 or commercial (210) 565-0381. 7.10.  Air Force Academy Leave Program.  The Superintendent of the United States Air Force Academy  (USAFA)  manages  the  leave  programs  for  its  faculty  and  staff  and  for  newly commissioned officers upon graduation from the USAFA. 7.10.1.  Graduation  Leave.    Graduation  leave  is  non-chargeable  leave  for  graduates  of  the Service academies. 7.10.1.1.  The    USAFA    Superintendent    may    authorize    up    to    60    days    of    non-chargeable leave, military requirements permitting. 7.10.1.2.  Graduates  take  and  complete  graduation  leave  within  3  months  after  the member’s  graduation  and  before  the  member  reports  to  the  first  PCS  or  port  of embarkation for permanent duty outside the CONUS. 7.10.1.3.  Graduates placed on TDY or hospitalized during the leave period may revert to leave  status  to  complete  the  leave  provided  completion  if  the  leave  occurs  within  3 months after graduation. In such cases, the activity having responsibility for the member when TDY or hospitalization occurs approves continuation of graduation leave status. 7.11.  Personnel  Detailed  or  Assigned for  Peace Operations.  Effective 1 Dec 94, personnel detailed or assigned to the UN for peace operations may take non-chargeable leave.  Prior to 1 Dec 94, any leave taken was chargeable leave. the  United  Nations to (UN)   60  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 7.11.1.  UN  Non-chargeable  Leave.    UN  Force  commanders  or  chief  military  observers approve    leave    for    Air    Force    members    within    their    geographic    area    of    authority.  Members: 7.11.1.1.  May take UN non-chargeable leave within the geographic area of the UN Force commanders' or chief military observers' authority. 7.11.1.2.  Use    the    AF    Form    988,    annotate    PTDY,    and    cite    this    paragraph    as authority. 7.11.2.  UN Pass: 7.11.2.1.  UN  Force  commanders  or  chief  military  observers  may  grant  passes  for  Air Force members within their geographic area of authority. 7.11.2.2.  Members  granted  UN  passes  must  stay  within  the  geographic  area  of  the  UN Force commanders’ or chief military observers’ authority. (T-1) 7.11.2.3.  Document passes according to UN rules. 7.11.3.  Leave or Pass Outside the UN Geographic Area. 7.11.3.1.  Air Force members taking leave or passes outside the UN Force commanders' or chief military observers' geographic area of authority are under the control of the US chain of command and are in a non-duty status. 7.11.3.2.  Members  are  subject  to  US  laws,  directives,  and  instructions.    In  these occurrences: 7.11.3.2.1.  The UN Force commanders or chief military observers and the US chain of command representatives approve leave and passes. 7.11.3.2.2.  Members use AF Form 988 for leave, annotate ordinary, and cite this AFI as  authority  in  the  Remarks  section  of  Block  8.      This  is  chargeable  leave.  PCS  or TDY en route leave and emergency leave are also chargeable leave. 7.11.3.2.3.  The    US    chain    of    command    representatives    document    passes    in writing.  Cite this paragraph as authority. 7.12.  Educational Leave of Absence.  As of 14 Mar 2014, the Air Force Educational Leave of Absence  (AFELA)  was  suspended.   For  additional  details  on  AFELA,  see  AFI  36-2649,  AF Voluntary  Education  Program.    Should  the  program  be  reinstated,  AFPC  will  publish  a  field message with applicable guidelines and procedures. 7.13.  Reserve Component (RC) Carryover Leave.  RC members and AD members separating under Palace Chase/Palace Front may carry over leave earned during an active duty tour for use during a future active duty tour.  RC members are not required to use, sell or lose their earned leave at the end of an active duty tour. Carryover leave usage is not restricted to the next tour and may  be  used  on  future/subsequent  active  duty  tours.    While  members  are  authorized  to  carry leave  forward,  members  should  remember  that  leave  should  be  taken  when  earned  unless circumstances do not afford that opportunity. Commanders should strongly encourage members to  take  leave  during  the  tour  in  which  the  leave  was  earned  as  there  is  no  guarantee  that  leave carried forward can be used due to unforeseen mission requirements. 7.13.1.  Carryover Leave Usage (see AFRC Leave Carry Over Guide): AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   61  7.13.1.1.  A  member  must  not  be  called/ordered  to  active  duty  for  the  sole  purpose  of taking carryover leave. 7.13.1.2.  Member must obtain gaining commander's approval for carryover leave usage prior  to  issuance  of  orders.    The  commander's  approval  must  include  validation  of resource  availability,  to  include  O&M  funding,  if  appropriate.    Members  who  wish  to take carryover leave during a tour must present documentation (e.g., Defense Finance and Accounting  Service  (DFAS),  Defense  Joint  Military  Pay  System  (DJMS),  previous Orders) that reflects member's carryover leave balance. 7.13.1.3.  If the gaining commander approves, the carryover leave days will be included as  part  of  the  overall  tour  length  and  carryover  leave  will  be  taken  during  that  tour.  Example: RC member agrees to a 60-day tour and asks to use 10 days of carryover leave.  Commander approves an overall 70-day tour length that includes authorized travel, duty time, annual leave accrued during the tour (5 days) and the 10 days of carryover leave. 7.13.1.4.  The gaining commander has discretion to approve and cancel approved leave if mission or circumstances (e.g., disciplinary actions) dictate. 7.13.1.5.  If  the  request  that  led  to  approved  leave  is  withdrawn  by  the  member,  or  the commander cancels previously approved carryover leave, the unused carryover leave will be credited back to the member’s leave balance and tour length adjusted. 7.13.1.6.  When a member does not take leave during a tour of duty and chooses not  to sell it, this leave must be carried forward to the next active duty long tour. 7.13.2.  Carryover Leave Limitations: 7.13.2.1.  Carryover leave cannot be taken in conjunction with an Annual Tour. 7.13.2.2.  Carryover leave cannot be used to justify entering sanctuary for the purpose of an active duty retirement. 7.13.2.3.  Members  may  not  carry  more  than  60  days  of  leave  from  one  FY  to  the  next unless authorized SLA (see Chapter 6). 7.13.2.4.  Leave  cannot  be  carried  over  for  the  Regular  AF  (except  for  members transferring  into  the  AGR  program  with  no  break  in  service  to  include  PALACE CHASE/PALACE FRONT), ANG or other services transferring into the AFR. Members must settle all leave accounts prior to transferring. 7.13.2.4.1.  AFR  members  transferring  within  the  Selected  Reserve  from  AGR,  the losing Reserve Pay Office (RPO)/Financial Services Office (FSO) will submit a CMS case to request accrued leave be transferred to the member’s new pay record. 7.13.2.5.  Sell back of carryover leave will be limited to 60 days per career (not including excepted  leave).    For  additional  details  on  selling  back  leave,  see  AFRC  Leave  Carry Over Guide. 7.13.3.  Tracking/Payout of Carryover Leave: 7.13.3.1.  Carryover leave will be tracked via DFAS and DJMS. 7.13.3.2.  There are no restrictions on use of Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA), to include  Medical  Continuation  Orders  (MEDCON)  or  Reserve  Personnel  Appropriation   62  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 (RPA) earned leave based on the type of order in which the leave was earned or which it can  be  used.    Therefore,  leave  earned  in  one  active  duty  status  may  be  authorized  and taken in a different active duty status funded by a distinct and different appropriation. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   63  Chapter 8 POST DEPLOYMENT/MOBILIZATION RESPITE ABSENCE (PDMRA)  8.1.  Overview.  In  support  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense’s  utilization  of  the  Total  Force  policy, the PDMRA is established for members who are required to mobilize or deploy with a frequency beyond  established  rotation  goals.    The  yearly  rotation  goal  consists  of  a  deployment-to-dwell ratio of 1:2 years for active duty personnel and 1:5 years for the Reserve component.  That is, for every one (1) year an active duty service member is deployed, he/she requires two (2) years at the home station; and for every one (1) year a Reserve component service member is deployed, he/she  requires  five  (5)  years  at  the  home  station.    This  policy  applies  to  all  members  with creditable deployments and mobilizations underway on, or commencing after, 19 January 2007. PDMRA is a type of Administrative Absence. 8.1.1.  Active Component. 8.1.1.1.  Creditable Deployments/TDYs occurring on or after 19 January 2007, but before 1  October  2011.  For  the  purpose  of  accruing  PDMRA  under  this  program,  creditable deployments/TDYs  include  deployments/TDYs  to  the  land  areas  of  Afghanistan  or  Iraq or with certain theater units (units that routinely conduct operations or support units that conduct  operations  in  Iraq  but  are  not  based  in  Iraq).  Aircrew  participating  in  missions into, out of, within or over the Area of Eligibility in support of military operations, count each  day  of  operation  as  one  day  of  eligibility.  Deployment  is  defined  as  a  member  on Temporary  Duty  under  Contingency,  Exercise,  and  Deployment  (CED)  orders  or  other orders  indicating  Operation  ENDURING  FREEDOM/Operation  IRAQI  FREEDOM (OEF/OIF) support, Plan Identification/Unit Line Number (PID/ULN),  or similar terms. The  orders  state  “in  support  of  OEF/OIF,”  an  OEF/OIF  PID/ULN,  or  similar  terms. Normally,  the  "certain  theater  units"  are  those  in  Kuwait,  Qatar,  United  Arab  Emirates, and  Manas,  Kyrgyzstan  supporting  units  performing  operations  in  or  airspace  over Iraq/Afghanistan. 8.1.1.2.  Creditable  Time.  Creditable  time  for  the  purpose  of  determining  eligibility  is calculated  as  all  creditable  deployments  (time  in  theater  only,  travel  time  to/from  not included) accomplished within a “rolling 36-month window” on or after 19 January 2007, but  before  1  October  2011.  For  example,  if  the  member  returned  to  the  home  station (dwell) on 20 January 2011, after serving 15 full months in the Area of Eligibility, he/she would  have  “broken  dwell”  by  being  deployed  beyond  12  months  and  would  be authorized PDMRA of 3 days. 8.1.1.2.1.  Creditable time continues to accrue during periods of Rest & Recuperation (R&R),  in-theater  R&R,  leave,  and  for  TDYs  from  the  Area  of  Eligibility  to  areas outside of Afghanistan or Iraq of 30 consecutive days or less. 8.1.2.  Reserve Component. 8.1.2.1.  Qualifying  Mobilizations  occurring  on  or  after  19  January  2007,  but  before  1 October  2011.  For  the  purpose  of  accruing  PDMRA  under  this  program,  creditable mobilizations are defined as mobilizations under sections 12301 (A), 12302, or 12304 of Title  10  of  the  United  States  Code.  This  period  includes  the  effective  date  of  the member’s mobilization order through the date of the expiration of the mobilization order.    64  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 Aircrew  participating  in  missions  into,  out  of,  within  or  over  the  Area  of  Eligibility  in support of military operations, count each day of operation as one day of eligibility. 8.1.2.1.1.  To implement P.L. 112-120, IAW the OSD Memo dated 27 Jul 2012, the following  procedures  apply  for  current  and  former  RC  members  on  mobilization orders    issued  under  10  USC  sections  12301(a);  12302  or  12304,  whose  orders (without amendments) commenced after 19 Jan 2007 and before 1 Oct 2011: 8.1.2.1.1.1.  Eligible  former  and  current  RC  members  will  need  to  apply  for benefits authorized in PL 112-120.  Eligible current RC members:  If not currently mobilized, member may elect to receive PDMRA days or a payment of $200 per day.  If the member who is not currently mobilized elects PDMRA days, the days will  be  banked  and  cannot  be  used  until  the  next  qualifying  period  of  service.  Alternatively,  if  the  member  is  mobilized,  the  member  may  elect  to  use  the PDMRA  days  that  will  be  added  to  the  current  mobilization  order  or  bank  the days  that  cannot  be  used  until  the  next  qualifying  period  of  service  or  receive  a cash  payment  of  $200/day.  Banked  days  will  be  lost  if  the  member  is  separated from  the  military  service  prior  to  being  able  to  use  the  banked  PDMRA  days.  Eligible  former  RC  members:    the  only  option  is  to  receive  a  $200  payment  for each  qualifying  PDMRA  day.      The  RC  (Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National Guard)  will  identify,  by-name,  all  eligible  claimants  and  track  those  eligible claimants  regarding  days  earned  and  disbursements/benefits  provided.  RC  will establish   Air  Force  Reserve  (AFRC/A1RR  and AFRC/FGC/FGS)  has  primary  responsibility  for  implementation,  tracking  and records  for  Air  Force  reservists.    Air  National  Guard  (ANG/A1PR)  has  primary responsibility for implementation, tracking and records for members of the ANG. implementation  plans. 8.1.2.1.1.2.  RC  implementation  plans  will  include  procedures  to  apply,  certify and  process  requests  for  additional  PDRMA  days;  identification  of  one  primary and one alternate certifying officer who will verify the accuracy and correctness of information in the applicant’s supporting documents that will be used by DFAS to authorize payment.  RC will coordinate with DFAS to obtain monthly feedback disbursement reports. Feedback reports, to include amounts of PDMRA payments disbursed,  will  be  provided  to  AF/A1PA,  by  first  business  day  of  each  month.   Ensure  procedures  document  that  each  RC  eligible  member  understands  there  is an option of receiving a PDMRA day which can be banked/used IAW paragraph 8.1.2.1.1.1 or payment of $200 for each PDMRA day that the RC member would have  been  eligible  to  receive  had  the  1  Oct  11  PDMRA  changes  not  applied  to that  member.    For  former  RC  members,  their  only  option  is  to  receive  a  $200 payment  for  each  qualifying  PDMRA  day.    Former  RC  members  who  were discharged or released from service under other than honorable conditions are not eligible for these benefits per PL 112-120. 8.1.2.1.1.3.  Points of Contact for AF Reserve and Guard, respectively, will need to retain a copy of applicant’s supporting documents, a calculation record that is used to verify the accuracy of the computation, and a copy of the certified record provided to DFAS for payment.  The record should be retained for not less than six years (6) and three months. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   65  8.1.2.1.1.4.  No payments shall be made to qualifying RC members prior to 1 Oct 2012  and  payments  will  only  be  made  on  or  after  that  date  if  authorized  funds used  to  make  the  payments  are  available  pursuant  to  the  Appropriations  Act enacted after 25 May 2012, pursuant to PL 112-120. 8.1.2.1.1.5.  The  authority  to  provide  benefits  per  PL  112-120  expires  on  1 October 2014. 8.1.2.2.  Creditable  Time.  Creditable  time  is  calculated  as  all  creditable  mobilization accomplished  within  a  “rolling  72-month  window”  starting  no  earlier  than  7  October 2001.  Note:  Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel who were mobilized on or after 19 January  2007  and  have  previous  voluntary  deployment  (Title  10  USC  Section 12301(d)  orders  to  Afghanistan  or  Iraq  after  7  October  2001  or  72  months  prior  to member’s mobilization, whichever is most recent, will have that period used as creditable time for award of PDMRA. (T-3)Example:   In 2003, a member serves in Iraq on Section 12301(d)  orders  for  6  months,  and  is  then  mobilized  for  8  months  in  2007.      Member would be credited with a total of 14 months of creditable time earning 2 days of PDMRA. (T-2)  If  a  member  has  been  previously  mobilized,  only  that  time  served  on  Section 12301(d)  orders  since  the  most  recent  demobilization  is  counted  as  creditable  time  if PDMRA was earned on the previous mobilization. 8.1.3.  For deployment/mobilization accomplished on or after 19 January 2007, but before 1 October 2011, accumulation of PDMRA is as follows in Figure 8.1:   66  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 Figure 8.1.  Post Deployment Mobilization Respite Absence Accumulator (for deployment/mobilization accomplished on or after 19 January 2007, but before 1 October 2011). Deployed Beyond Following Months PDMRA Per Month Cumulative Days of PDMRA Credit 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 22 Note:    Concerning  the  first  column,  “ Deployed  Beyond    Following    Months,”  PDMRA  is provided  for  each  month  or  fraction  thereof  a  member  is  deployed/mobilized  in  excess  of  12 months  within  a  36-month  “rolling  window”  (or  a  72-month  “rolling  window”  for  reserve component  members).   Twelve  months is defined as 365 days. Note:   If a member is deployed/mobilized in a creditable Area of Eligibility beyond 12 months within the 36-month “rolling window” (or a 72-month “rolling window” for reserve component members)  then  he/she  is  eligible  for  PDMRA.   The  duration of the deployment does not have to be consecutive, but is instead cumulative. Example: A member is deployed for 9 months, returns to the place of dwell for 8 months, and is then  deployed  again  for  an  additional  5  months,  this  person  would  have    broken    dwell    by  being  deployed  for  14  months  in  a  22-month  window. Keeping in mind that the ratio for an active duty service member is for every 1 year deployed, he/she must have 2 years outside the Area of Eligibility (normally, this is the home station, but could include other TDYs which are not within the Area of Eligibility) the member would be authorized 2 days of PDMRA.  8.1.4.  Program Administration. 8.1.4.1.1.  Commanders  submit  PDMRA  requests  through  the  servicing  Force Support Squadron to the following offices for approval. (T-3) 8.1.4.1.1.1.  Active Component:  AFPC/DP2SSM is the approval authority for all AC  PDMRA  requests.    AFPC/DP2SSM  will  approve  and  track  all  requests meeting the guidelines in this instruction. 8.1.4.1.1.2.  Air  Force  Reserve:    AFRC/A1RR  and  AFRC/FGC/FGS  is  the approval  authority  for  all  AFR  PDMRA  requests.   AFRC/A1RR  and AFRC/FGC/FGS will approve and track all requests meeting the guidelines in this instruction. AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   67  8.1.4.1.1.3.  Air  National  Guard:    ANG/A1PR  is  the  approval  authority  for  all ANG PDMRA requests.  ANG/A1PR will approve and track all requests meeting the guidelines in this instruction. 8.1.4.1.2.  Reserve  component  members  who  are  federal,  state,  or  local  government civilian  employees,  and are “precluded  by law” from  being paid  by  federal,  state  or local governments simultaneously serving in a reserve component status and in their civilian jobs may elect to receive Assignment Incentive Pay (AIP) (37 U.S.C. Section 307a)  in  lieu  of  being  awarded  administrative  absence  days.  Federal  employees  are advised that they are prohibited from working at their civilian government positions while  on  PDMRA.  Prior  to  deployment,  a  member  opting  AIP  must  sign  a  written AIP  agreement  for  payment.  (T-3)    For  this  purpose,  the  AIP  is  valued  at  a  rate  of $200  for  each  day  of  administrative  absence  authorized/earned  under  the  PDMRA program,  not  to  exceed  the  $3000  monthly  maximum  payable  to  an  individual member  under  37  U.S.C.  Section  307a.  A  member  qualifying  for  AIP  under  more than  one  incentive  program  may  receive  concurrent  AIP  payments,  not  to  exceed more than $3000 monthly in total AIP payments. 8.1.4.1.3.  Active component members must use PDMRA within 12 months of return from deployment or it is forfeited. (T-3)  PDMRA is used prior to, or in conjunction with, the next PCS/PCA.  PDMRA is not used as justification for authorizing special leave accrual. 8.1.4.1.4.  PDMRA  days  earned  must  be  used  during  the  deployment/mobilization order period, including amendments/extensions, under which the PDMRA days were earned. They can also be used when the member is on ADOS/RC when those orders immediately  follow  the  qualifying  mobilization.  PDMRA  days  cannot  be  carried forward/rolled over to a new deployment/mobilization period.  Example:  RC Airman is mobilized on 12302 orders from 1 Jan 08 until 1 Jan 10 (24 months) and earns and uses 22 days of PDMRA.  RC Airman has a new mobilization on 12302 orders from 1 Jul 11 to 31 Aug 11 (2  months).  Question:  How much PDMRA did RC Airman earn from 1 Jul 11 to 31 Aug 11?  Answer:  8 days (4 days/month earned in current period of orders for 1 Jul – 31 Aug 11. 8.1.4.1.4.1.  Mobilization/deployment orders of Reserve Component Airmen may be  extended,  within  statutory  limitations,  to  allow  Airmen  to  use  PDMRA  days accrued  during  the  mobilization.    Reserve  Component  Airmen  do  not  accrue PDMRA  days  during  the  time  that  mobilization  orders  are  extended  for  the purpose  of  utilizing  PDMRA  days.    AFRC/A1RR  and  ANG/A1PR  will  send validated mobilization order extension requests to AF/A5XW for approval. 8.1.4.1.4.2.  Reserve  Component  Airmen  must  be  serving  pursuant  to  sections 12301(a),  12301(d),  12302,  or  12304  of  Title  10  of  the  United  States  Code  in order  to  utilize  the  administrative  absence  days  accrued  under  the  PDMRA program.     68  AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016 8.1.5. Program guidance for qualifying deployments and mobilizations beginning on or after 1 October 2011. 8.1.5.1.  Creditable Time.  Airmen, at a minimum, must meet PDMRA eligibility criteria contained in paragraph 8.1 and 8.1.5 of this AFI for 30 consecutive days in order to begin accruing PDMRA days. 8.1.5.2.  Creditable time for Active Component (AC).  AC Airmen who, on the first day of their current deployment, had deployed in excess of 12 months out of the previous 36 months,  and  who  meet  the  other  eligibility  criteria  contained  in  this  instruction,  qualify for  PDMRA  days.  Example:    If  an  AC  Airman’s  cumulative  deployments  of  30 consecutive days or longer is more than 12 months out of the previous 36 months, he/she is eligible to accrue PDMRA if deployed to a location authorized for PDMRA accrual. 8.1.5.1.1.  Creditable  time  for  Reserve  Component  (RC).    RC  Airmen  who,  on  the first  day  of  their  current  qualifying  mobilization/deployment,  had  been  mobilized pursuant to sections 12301(a), 12302, or 12304 of Title 10 of the United States Code in  excess  of  12  months  out  of  the  previous  72  months,  and  who  meet  the  other eligibility criteria contained in this enclosure, qualify for PDMRA days.  In addition, voluntary deployments on 12301(d) orders to a Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) area will be used for determining creditable time for PDMRA accrual.  Example:  An RC Airman is mobilized on 12302 orders from 1 Jan to 31 Oct 09 (10  months) and then deployed to Iraq on 12301(d) orders from 1 Jan – 31 Apr 10 (4 months) he/she will  have  14  creditable  months  toward  breaking  the  threshold  requirement  for PDMRA  eligibility.  In  this  case,  he/she  would  be  eligible  to  accrue  PDMRA  if deployed/mobilized to a location authorized for PDMRA accrual. 8.1.5.2.  PDMRA  Accrual  Rates.    PDMRA  begins  to  accrue  after  30  consecutive  days BOG, and is provided for each month or fraction of a month beyond 30 consecutive days.  PDMRA  days  cannot  be  carried  forward/rolled  over  to  a  new  deployment/mobilization period. 8.1.5.2.1.  Two Administrative Days Per Month 8.1.5.2.1.1.  AC Airmen accrue 2 administrative absence days per month when the deployment  threshold  in  paragraph  8.1.5.1.1  of  this  AFI  is  exceeded  and  the Airman  is  entitled  to  CZTE  for  deployment  to  a  combat  zone.    Creditable  time starts when the Airman is BOG at the CZTE location (the same day they become eligible for CZTE). 8.1.5.2.1.2.  RC Airmen serving pursuant to sections 12301(a), 12301(d), 12302, or  12304  of  Title  10  of  the  United  States  Code  accrue  2  administrative  absence days  per  month  when  the  mobilization/deployment  threshold  in  paragraph 8.1.5.1.2  of  this  AFI  is  exceeded  and  the  Airman  is  entitled  to  CZTE  for  active service in a combat zone.  Creditable time starts when the Airman is BOG at the CZTE location (the same day they become eligible for CZTE). 8.1.5.2.2.  One Administrative Day Per Month 8.1.5.2.2.1.  RC  Airmen  serving  pursuant  to  sections  12301(a),  12302,  or  12304 of  Title  10  of  the  United  States  Code  accrue  1  administrative  absence  day  per AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   69  month  when  the  mobilization  threshold  in  paragraph  8.1.5.1.2  of  this  AFI  is exceeded  and  the  Airman  is  outside  of  the  United  States,  not  in  a  CZTE  area.  Creditable time starts when the Airman is BOG outside of the United States. Figure 8.2.

Same RC Airman is mobilized from 1 Oct 11 – 31 May 12 (8 months) on 12302 orders.  From 1 Oct 11 – 31 Mar 12 (6 months), RC Airman was BOG in Afghanistan; from 1 Apr – 31 May 12 (2 months) RC Airman was INSIDE United States. Question:  How many days of PDMRA are accrued?  Answer:  14 days. RC Airman exceeded mobilization threshold (12 months of mobilization out of 72 prior months) on 1 Oct 11 IAW para. 15.5.1.2.  While in Afghanistan from 1 Oct 11 – 31 Mar 12 (6 months), the Airman accrued 2  days/month  for  6  months  (12  days)  IAW  para.  15.5.2.1  (Figure  8.2).    While  inside  the  United  States from 1 Apr – 31 May 12 (2 months), the Airman accrued 0 days PDMRA. Example  2:    RC  Airman  is  mobilized  from  1  Jan  10  –  31  Jan  12  (25  months)  on  12302  orders  in Washington, DC. Question:  How many days of PDMRA were accrued?  Answer:  14 days. RC  Airman’s  PDMRA  creditable  time  and  accrual  rate  for  1  Jan  10  –  30  Sep  11  (21  months)  is calculated IAW para. 15.2.2 and Figure 8.1 -- the Airman accrues 14 days PDMRA for those 21 months since they exceeded the mobilization threshold (12 months of mobilization out of 72 prior months) on 1 Jan 11. The Airman’s PDMRA creditable time and accrual rate for 1 Oct 11 – 31 Jan 12 (4 months) is calculated IAW  para  15.5.1.2  and  15.5.2  (also  Figure  8.2)  –  the  Airman  accrues  0  days  PDMRA  since  they  were INSIDE the United States (Washington, DC).       AFI36-3003  11 MAY 2016   71  Example 3:  AC Airman was deployed to Afghanistan from 1 Jul – 31 Dec 09 (6 months), 1 Jul – 31 Dec 10 (6 months), and 1 Jul – 31 Dec 11 (6 months). Question:  How many days of PDRMA were accrued?  Answer:  9 days. AC  Airmen  creditable  time  and  accrual  rate  for  1  Jul  –  30  Sep  11  (3  months)  is  calculated  IAW  para. 15.1 and Figure 8.1 – the Airman accrues 3 days PDMRA for those 3 months since they were deployed beyond  the  threshold  (12  months  of  deployment  out  of  36  prior  months)  on  1  Jul  11  and  in  a  location where PDMRA could be accrued. The Airman’s PDMRA creditable time and accrual rate for 1 Oct – 31 Dec 11 (3 months) is calculated IAW para. 15.5.1 and 15.5.2 (also Figure 8.2) – the Airman accrues 6 days for those 3 months since they were deployed beyond the threshold (12 months of deployment out of 36 prior months) on 1 Jul 11 and in a location where PDMRA could be accrued.
