SUMMARY OF CHANGES This publication has been revised to reflect the addition of Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force, Resources Directorate (SAF/AAR) as part of the mandatory coordination process specific to HAF MDs, and reflects the location of Secretariat and Air Staff HAF MD templates within the Air Force Information Publishing Tool (AFIMPT) 2     HOI 90-1  31 MARCH 2016 (https://wmsweb.afncr.af.mil/afimpt/).  This instruction has been substantially revised and should be reviewed thoroughly. 1.  Overview. HAF MDs are publications signed by the SECAF documenting the delegations of authority and assignments of responsibility to HAF (Secretariat and Air Staff) two-letter offices. When applicable, HAF MDs also state special limitations or provisions affecting re-delegation and/or re-assignment, that are not already specified in statute or other relevant documents.  HAF MDs do not dictate procedures.  Any policy or procedural guidance required to implement the authorities or responsibilities in HAF MDs will be issued in Air Force departmental publications in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.  All Secretary of the Air Force Orders (SAFOs) in effect as of the date of this Headquarters Operating Instruction (HOI) remain in effect until expressly cancelled or superseded by a HAF MD. 2.  Responsibilities. 2.1.  The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/AA) administers the HAF MD process through the Information Management Directorate (SAF/AAI). 2.2.  Two-letter.  Each HAF two-letter organization shall assign a point of contact (POC) / action officer (AO) that will develop and maintain the HAF MD.  The POC/AO: 2.2.1.  Prepares their two-letter HAF MD using the appropriate template located on the AFIMPT website ensuring:  2.2.1.1.  The HAF MD is numbered as referenced in Attachment 3 of this HOI. 2.1.1.2.  DoD issuances assigned to the two-letter organization IAW AFPD 90-1 and AFI 90-101, Processing Department of Defense Issuances, as documented in the Issuances, Delegations of Authority and Responsibilities (IDAR) database (https://www.idar.hq.af.mil/Presentation/Common/index.cfm), are included in Attachment 1 of the HAF MD. 2.2.1.3.  Narratives effectively describe the organization’s mission, delegated authority and assigned responsibility including re-delegation limitations. 2.2.1.4.  The authorities/responsibilities listed accurately reflect information in the most current version of cited DoD issuances, statute, public law, executive order, or other source documentation. 2.2.2.  Obtains necessary functional/oversight and mandatory coordination specific to HAF MDs (see paragraph 4.1) using AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request. 2.2.3.  Staffs the final draft for certification and approval. 2.2.4.  Maintains the official record set of the HAF MD in accordance with instructions in AFI 33-360, and records management guidance in AFMAN 33-363. 2.2.5.  Ensures standard operating  procedures (SOP) are developed as appropriate/ necessary.  HAF two-letter organizations that regularly work together are encouraged, but not required, to develop SOPs that set forth the procedures that will be followed to fulfill and carry out the missions, and roles that are set forth in their respective HAF MDs. These SOPs are set forth in writing and signed by the principals of the organizations HOI 90-1  31 MARCH 2016  3 concerned.  All affected organizations should attach the SOPs to their respective HAF MDs.  The SOPs shall be amended and reissued as needed or during rewrites of the HAF MD and attached to the HAF MD of the organizations concerned.  Amended SOPs do not require prior notification or coordination with SAF/GCA or SAF/AAII.  Forward amended SOPs to AFDPO, IAW AFI 33-360, for posting to the e-Publishing website. 2.2.6.  Reviews the HAF MD, to include SOPs, periodically IAW AFI 33-360, and revises as required. 2.3.  General Counsel, Fiscal, Ethics and Administrative Law (SAF/GCA): 2.3.1.  Is the focal point for HAF MD reviews for Secretary of the Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GC). 2.3.2.  Reviews HAF MDs to provide advice and assistance on fiscal and administrative law issues, and identifies conflicts and contradictions with other HAF MDs. 2.3.3.  Routes internally within SAF/GC as needed for further reviews. 2.3.4.  Provides consolidated set of comments back to POC/AO. 2.4.  Policy and CIO Support Division, Policy Branch (SAF/AAII): 2.4.1.  Is the focal point for HAF MDs. 2.4.2.  Reviews HAF MDs to ensure proper format and ensures content does not conflict with other HAF MDs. 2.4.3.  Ensures content of Attachment 1 to the HAF MD includes authorities listed in the Issuance, Delegations of Authority and Responsibility (IDAR) database. 2.5.  Air Force Departmental Publishing Office (AFDPO): 2.5.1.  Sends a request (via Air Force Information Management Publishing Tool (AFIMPT)) to POC/AOs for periodic review of HAF MDs. 2.5.2.  Posts approved HAF MDs on the e-Publishing website. 3.  HAF MD Development.  Two templates for HAF MDs (one for Secretariat offices and one for Air Staff offices) in Word versions are maintained in AFIMPT under Templates (see samples at Attachment 2).  The appropriate template must be applied when developing a draft HAF MD. 3.1.  Publication body.  The body will contain the following paragraphs/subparagraphs: 3.1.1.  “Mission.”  A brief description of the organization’s mission. 3.1.2.  “Organizational relationships.”  States to whom the head of the organization reports and describes any relationships with other organizations, i.e., relationships with organizations under their purview and/or organizations that may have an interest in or oversight of their functions.  Field Operating Agencies (FOAs) and/or Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) that fall under an organization will be referenced in this section. However, their missions will be documented in an AFMD.  See HAF MD template(s) for language to use when referencing FOAs and/or DRUs. 3.1.3.  “Responsibilities.” A broad description of the organization’s responsibilities.     4     HOI 90-1  31 MARCH 2016 3.1.4.  “Delegations of Authority/Asssignments of Responsibility.”   A single paragraph  that will have the legal effect of incorporating the delegations of authority and  assignments of responsibility set forth in Attachment 1 of each HAF MD.  This paragraph  should also state the general rules for subsequent re-delegations of those authorities. 3.1.5.  “Notifications to Congress.”  When appropriate, a paragraph stating general limitations on the authority to provide notifications or reports to Congress on re-delegated  authorities. 3.1.6.  “Continuation of Prior Re-Delegations of Authoriy/Assignments of Responsibility.”  Use verbiage provided in applicable template. 3.1.7.  “Revocation of Secertary of the Air Force Order.”  Provide the SAFO number, title and publication date that will be superseded by the HAF MD being written. Only include this paragraph when a SAFO is being superseded. Normally revisions will not  require this paragraph. 3.2.  Publication Attachments. 3.2.1.  Attachment 1 will be titled “Delegations of SECAF Authority and Assignments of  Responsibility.”  Attachment 1 will set forth specific delegated authorities or assigned  responsibilities along with the specific source of the authority/responsibility (typically  Department of Defense issuances, although occasionally United States Code, Public Law,  or Executive Order, if not cited in a DoD issuance). 3.2.1.1.  Individual entries in Attachment 1 should differentiate between specific authority delegated and overall responsibility for compliance with a responsibility  assigned.  See HAF MD templates for examples. 3.2.1.2.  Special limitations or provisions affecting the specific re-delegation or re- assignment of any particular authority will be identified.  Delegations/assigments may  specify the lowest organizational level to which re-delegation/re-assignment is allowed by SECAF and any other relevant limitations or conditions on the re- delegated/re-assigned authority.  Where delegation or re-delegation is not restricted, the particular authority may be delegated / re-delegated, with or without limitations or  conditions. 3.2.1.3.  Unless re-delegation is restricted, any re-delegation or reassignment of  authority will be documented in some other medium (i.e., a re-delegation is  accomplished via memorandum or a departmental publication [e.g., AFI]). 3.2.2.  Attachment 2 will describe the organizational structure of the two-letter organization.  It includes an organizational chart, down to the three-letter level, and brief  descriptions of each office’s functions. 3.2.3.  Attachment 3 will list SOPs, as applicable.  See paragraph 2.2.5. 4.  Coordination, Certification and Approval. Coordination is the process in which the OPR obtains endorsements of the proposed publication from offices with functional interest/technical  expertise, oversight responsibilities, statutory/regulatory review requirements.  These  endorsements must be obtained prior to seeking certification and approving official's signatures  on the AF Form 673.  Assistance in determining appropriate HOI 90-1  31 MARCH 2016  5 offices/organizations from which  coordination should be obtained is found in AFI 33-360 Table A3.1.  This table is not all-inclusive but provides recommended coordinating offices for certain subject areas/conditions.  NOTE: All HAF MDs must receive coordination from SAF/AAR, SAF/GCA and SAF/AAI  Policy Branch (in this order). 4.1.  Coordination. 4.1.1.  The POC/AO will obtain SAF/AAR coordination.  SAF/AAR verifies the office titles, symbols and descriptions used in the draft are official.  SAF/AAR coordination can be obtained concurrently during initial technical/functional coordination.  All Office Symbol Code (OSC) packages should be approved prior to submitting to SAF/GCA and SAF/AAII Policy Branch for coordination. 4.1.2.  The POC/AO will obtain SAF/GC and SAF/GCA coordination.  SAF/GC and SAF/GCA coordination is obtained AFTER technical/functional and BEFORE  coordination is requested from SAF/AA and SAF/AAII Policy Branch.  SAF/GC and SAF/GCA coordination can be attained through a single AO/POC TMT tasking to SAF/GC that requests coordination from both offices. 4.1.3.  The POC/AO will obtain SAF/AA and SAF/AAII Policy Branch coordination. SAF/AA and SAF/AAII Policy Branch coordination can be ottained through a single AO/POC TMT tasking to SAF/AA that requests coordination from both offices.  This is the final coordination required before certification and approval. 4.2.  Certification and Approval.  After receiving HAF MD-specific mandatory coordination from SAF/GCA and SAF/AAII Policy Branch, the POC/AO will: 4.2.1.  Obtain the Certifying Official’s (owning two-letter) signature on the consolidated AF Form 673; 4.2.2.  Prepare a package that includes: the proposed draft HAF MD, the consolidated coordinated AF Form 673 and the CRM (if applicable). Route this package through the Headquarters Air Force Executive Secretariat (HAF/ES), for approval by the Approving Official (SECAF), in accordance with Table 4.1 below. 4.3.  fter obtaining the Approving Official’s (SECAF) signature on AF Form 673, the POC/AO will submit the approved HAF MD and signed AF Form 673 to AFPDO, via AFIMPT, for publishing to the ePublishing website.  The POC/AO will file and maintain the approved package as part of the official record-set. Table 4.1.  Routing for Certification and Approval of HAF MD Route to: Certifiying Official HAF/ES AF/CVA AF/CV SAF/US AF/CC SAF/OS (Approving Official) Owning two-letter Executive Action Group Assistant Vice Chief of Staff Vice Chief of Staff Under Secretary of the Air Force Chief of Staff of the Air Force Secretary of the Air Force - - - - - -       -    6     HOI 90-1  31 MARCH 2016 5.  Revisions.  The POC/AO will submit all proposed revisions to SAF/GCA and SAF/AAII Policy Branch.  SAF/AAII Policy Branch, in consultation with SAF/GCA, will determine whether proposed changes are administrative or substantive. 5.1.  ative Changes (ACs).  ACs are non-substantive revisions to the main text of the HAF MD or an attachment (e.g., office symbol change, office realignment, etc.).  ACs do not change the SECAF’s delegated authority or assignment of responsibility.  Only POCs/AOs may make administrative changes to their publications.  SAF/AAII Policy Branch and SAF/GCA coordination is required.  The POC/AO will provide a Word® document IAW the format referenced in AFI 33-360 for ACs.  Both the POC/AO and the two-letter (certifying official) sign the appropriate area of AF Form 673.  The POC/AO will submit the AC to AFPDO, via AFIMPT, for publishing to the ePublishing website.  The AC will sit on top of the HAF MD; the POC/AO will incorporate the information in the next revision. 5.2.  antive Changes.  The delegation of a new authority, substantive or significant change(s) to a DoD issuance, public law, or Executive Order, or a HAF reorganization/transfer of responsibilities between two-letters, are examples of circumstances that may necessitate  re-issuance of an existing HAF MD.  Substantive changes to HAF MDs are coordinated and processed in the same manner as original versions of HAF MDs.  HAF MDs should be updated as soon as possible to reflect substantive changes. 6.  Rescissions.  Rescissions of HAF MDs are based on the decision of the Secretary to reorganize or restructure the HAF (e.g., the disestablishment or merger of two-letter offices), or otherwise alter delegations of authority and/or assignments of responsibility.  Because HAF MDs delegate the SECAF’s authority, a HAF MD may only be rescinded by the SECAF.  HAF MDs must be submitted for rescission using AF Form 673 and are coordinated and processed in the same manner as a newly written HAF MD.
