It applies to all HC-130 and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) MC-130P Regular Air Force (RegAF), AFRC and ANG units and their                               2                              AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-1                                        assigned Back-up Aircraft Inventory (BAI) aircraft.  Waivers are IAW with AFI 11-2HC-130V3.  Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS)   Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  using  the  AF  IMT  847, Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication;  route  AF  IMT  847 from  the  field  through    appropriate  chain  of  command.    This checklist  complements  AFI  11-2HC-130V3,  HC-130  Operations Procedures, and is printed on standard 8 ½” x 11” bond paper then trimmed  to  a  unique  size  4  ½  “  x  6  ½”  that  will  fit  the  standard plastic HC/MC-130 aircrew checklist binders.    SUMMARY  OF  CHANGES:  The  following  checklist  have  been added with this revision:  Dropsonde Checklist, Precision Airdrop System  Operator  Preflight  Checklist.    Precision  Airdrop  System procedures have been added to the Air Drop Checklist for guided and  improved  airdrop  deployments.    Minimum  Equipment  Table from  AFI  11-2HC-130V3  and  associated  notes  have  been  added.  High  Altitude  Emergency  procedures  have  been  updated.    A “Depressurized” call has been added to Pre-Search/Pre-Deployment Checklist.    Note  [N],  Caution  [C]  and  Warning  [W]  annotations have been added to all checklists.                           AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-1                               3  PREMISSION Preflight Guide..................................................................5 Aircraft Commander’s Briefing Guide.............................7 Navigator’s Briefing Guide...............................................9 Pilot-Jumpmaster/Loadmaster Briefing Guide................12 Navigator-Jumpmaster Briefing Guide............................14 ACM Briefing Guide.......................................................16 DEPARTURE / ARRIVAL / ENROUTE Pilot Departure Briefing Guide........................................17 Pilot Arrival Briefing Guide............................................18 Combat Entry Briefing Guide…………………………21 Infil/Exfil Briefing Guide…………………………..….22 HELICOPTER AIR TO AIR REFUELING HAAR Briefing Guide......................................................24 AIRDROP Airdrop Briefing Guide....................................................26 PADS Operator Preflight Checklist.................................27 CDS Flap Setting Chart....................................................30 Airdrop Checklist.............................................................32 High Altitude Emergency Procedures..............................38 Dropsonde Checklist........................................................39 SEARCH AND RESCUE Search and Rescue Mission Briefing Guide.....................43                               4                              AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-1                                        Pre-Search/ Pre-Deployment Checklist.............................45 Equipment Deployment Checklist………………………47 Personnel Deployment Checklist………………………..48 Post-Search/Post-Deployment Checklist..........................49 HOT REFUELING AND FORWARD AREA REFUELING POINT FARP / Hot Refueling Briefing.........................................50 FARP / Hot Refueling Additional Info..............................51 Hot Refueling (Receiver) Checklist..................................52 FARP / Hot Refueling (Tanker) Checklist........................56 FARP / Hot Refueling Emergency Procedures.................59 ONLOAD / OFFLOAD Engine Running Offload (ERO) Checklist........................61 MISCELLANEOUS Rear Vision Device Checklist............................................63                                AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-1                               5 PREFLIGHT GUIDE (T-2) May be used to ensure preflight requirements are accomplished.   1.

Duplicate steps may be omitted when using these checklists.  When applicable the flight engineer will complete the UARSSI system check during aircraft preflight. Checklists are applicable to those aircraft equipped with and without the UARRSI modification.  When using the INFIL/EXFIL checklist, perform ON THE RUNWAY Checklist (through Step 2) as follows: 1.  Ramp and Door – “CLEAR TO OPEN” (P) 2.  “CLEAR TO OFFLOAD” [N] (P) NOTE:  (T-1)  Hot brake/Hung Flare checks.  Hung Flare checks (if required) will be accomplished prior to entering the hot refueling site.  The loadmaster will state “Clear to Taxi” after completion of required checks and when cargo compartment is secure.  Aircraft will then taxi into refueling area.  A Hot Brake Check will be completed if Hot Brakes are suspected. NOTE:  (T-2)  If flight operations will continue after FARP / Hot Refueling operations, complete the ON THE RUNWAY CHECKLIST if using INFIL/EXFIL procedures or resume with the BEFORE TAKEOFF checklist if using normal checklist. NOTE:  (T-2)  After the FARP / Hot Refueling Checklist has been called complete, ensure that all radios, navigational equipment, and ECM equipment is set as required to continue the mission.  This equipment is covered in the INFIL/EXFIL and BEFORE TAKEOFF checklists. NOTE:  If the sortie will terminate after refueling, complete the AFTER LANDING Checklist.  52                              AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-1                                                                      HOT REFUELING (RECEIVER) CHECKLIST 1.
