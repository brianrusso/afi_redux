These members will fill the positions of the ARFPC Executive Director and ARFPC Senior Enlisted Advisor. 7.1.1.  The  Executive  Director  position  should  be  filled  by  an  officer  holding  the  rank  of colonel who possesses experience in or other specialized knowledge of his or her RC’s policy matters.    The  Executive  Director  also  should  be  capable  of  drafting  ARC  policy recommendations  on  behalf  of  the  entire  committee  and  in  collaboration  with  all  affected HAF  and  MAJCOM  ARC  Advisors,  AFRC,  AF/RE,  NGB/CF,  and  the  National  Guard Bureau.  SAF/MRR is the hiring authority for the Executive Director position. 7.1.1.1.  SAF/MRR rates and supervises the Executive Director.   The Executive Director will  have  authority  to  act  on  behalf  of  the  ARFPC  in  implementing  ARFPC  approved plans,  programs,  and  policies  and  act  on  those  matters  that  do  not  require  formal committee  action.    Duties  will  include:    preparing  the  ARFPC  agenda  for  conferences, telephone-conferences, SecAF/CSAF briefings, Executive Board meetings, subcommittee meetings,  organizing  information  for  committee  members,  taking  necessary  steps  to assemble  a  meeting  of  the  ARFPC,  referring  matters  for  committee  consideration, processing  committee  recommendations,  supervising  all  administrative  matters  of  the ARFPC  to  include  leadership  of  the  ARFPC  support  staff,  and  representing  the Committee when ARC policy matters are being discussed within the HAF. 7.1.2.  The  Senior  Enlisted  Advisor  to  SAF/MRR  will  also  serve  as  the  Senior  Enlisted Advisor  to  ARFPC  and  contribute  to  the  administrative  support  for  the  functioning  of  the Committee.  This position should be filled by an E-9 member of the full-time support AGR program  from  either  RC.
