This  AFI  provides  general  direction  for  implementation  of  cybersecurity and  management  of  cybersecurity  programs  according  to  AFPD  33-2.    Compliance  ensures appropriate measures are taken to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of AF  IT  and  the  information  they  process.    This  AFI  ensures  the  use  of  appropriate  levels  of protection  against  threats  and  vulnerabilities,  helps  prevent  denial  of  service,  corruption  and compromise of information, and potential fraud, waste, and abuse of government resources.  1.1.1.  The  AF  cybersecurity  program  incorporates  strategy,  policy,  awareness/training, assessment, authorization, implementation and remediation.    1.1.2.  The  cybersecurity  discipline  aligns  with  the  AF  Cybersecurity  strategy  key  concept that  total  risk  avoidance  is  not  practical  and  therefore  risks  assessment  and  management  is required.  1.1.3.  Cybersecurity  encompasses  the  following  disciplines/functions:  Air  Force  Risk Management  Framework  (RMF),  IT  controls/countermeasures,  Communications  Security (COMSEC),  Computer  Security  (COMPUSEC),  TEMPEST  (formerly  known  as  Emissions Security  [EMSEC]),  AF  Assessment  and  Authorization  (A&A)  (formerly  known  as Certification  and  Accreditation  Program  [AFCAP]),  and  Cybersecurity  Workforce Improvement Program (WIP).  1.2.  Applicability.   This publication is binding on all military, civilian and contractors or other persons through the contract or other legally binding agreement with the Department of the Air Force, who develop, acquire, deliver, use, operate, or manage AF IT. This publication applies to all  AF  IT  used  to  process,  store,  display,  transmit,  or  protect  AF  information,  regardless  of classification or sensitivity.  AF IT includes but is not limited to:  Information Systems (Major applications  &  Enclaves),  Platform  Information  Technology  (PIT)  &  PIT  systems,  IT  Services (Internal & External), and IT Products (Software, Hardware, Applications).  1.2.1.  More restrictive  Federal, DoD,  and Director of National  Intelligence (DNI) directive requirements  governing  Special  Access  Program  (SAP)  information  take  precedence  over this  publication.    The  latest  version  of  all  publications  (e.g.,  Federal,  Joint,  DoD,  AF) referenced within this publication are to be used.    1.2.2.  This  publication  and  implementation  guidance  identified  within  is  not  applicable  to Intelligence  Community  ISs  to  include  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  (SCI)  ISs.  Refer  to  the  Intelligence  Community  (IC)  Directive  (ICD)  503,  Intelligence  Community Information Technology Systems Security Risk Management, Certification and Accreditation and or the Unified Cross Domain Services Management Office (UCDSMO) as applicable.   1.2.3.  Authority  for  AF  space  systems  rests  with  Air  Force  Space  Command  (AFSPC)  as delegated by US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). AF space systems generally follow AF Cybersecurity policy and processes; where exceptions exist, this instruction is annotated accordingly.    NOTE:    Non-AF  space  systems  follow  cybersecurity  policy  and  guidance  in DoDI  8581.01,  Information  Assurance  (IA)  Policy  for  Space  Systems  Used  by  the Department of Defense.      AFI33-200  31 AUGUST 2015 7 1.2.4.  Effective  implementation  and  resultant  residual  risk  associated  with  cybersecurity controls  is  assessed,  documented,  and  mitigated  according  to  DoDI  8510.01,  DoD  Risk Management  Framework  (RMF),  Air  Force  Manual  (AFMAN)  33-210,  Air  Force Assessment and Authorization Program, and the AF RMF Knowledge Service, for inclusion in the AF Information Technology (IT) A&A package.   1.3.  Objectives.    The  objective  of  the  AF  Cybersecurity  Program  is  to  manage  the  risk presented  by  adversary  cyber  capabilities  (purposeful  attacks)  and  intelligence,  environmental disruptions,  human  or  machine  errors,  and  to  maintain  mission  survivability  under  adversary offensive  cyber  operations.  The  AF  implements  and  maintains  the  Cybersecurity  Program  to adequately secure its information and IT assets.  The Cybersecurity Program:  1.3.1.  Ensures AF IT operate securely by protecting and maintaining IS / PIT resources and information processed throughout the system's life cycle.  1.3.2.  Protects  information  commensurate  with  the  level  of  risk  and  magnitude  of  harm resulting from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, or modification.  1.3.3.  Leverages  the  multi-tiered  organization-wide  risk  management  approach  defined  in NATIONAL Institute of Standards and technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk (See figure 1.1).    1.3.3.1.  Tier  1  –  Organization:    Risk  management  at  this  tier  is  performed  through cybersecurity governance bodies at the AF enterprise level.  1.3.3.2.  Tier 2 – Mission/Business Process: risk management at this tier is performed by mission owner level and is informed by the risk context, risk decisions, and risk activities at Tier 1.  1.3.3.3.  Tier  3  –  Information  System:    risk  management  at  this  tier  is  performed  by individuals  responsible  for  the  management  of  individual  IT  and  is  guided  by  the  risk context, risk decisions and risk activities at Tiers 1 and 2.
