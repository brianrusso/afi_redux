Air Force Architecting. 1.1.  Relevance.  The mandate to develop architectures comes from law (Clinger-Cohen Act, Title  10);  Federal  level  requirements  (OMB  A-11,  Federal  Enterprise  Architecture);  DoD policies  and  instructions  (DOD  5000.01,  CJCSI  3170  and  6212);  and  the  AF  policies  and instructions  (AFPD  33-4,  AFI  63-101).    The  intelligence  community  is  also  governed  by AFI33-401  17 MAY 2011   3  Intelligence  Community  Directive  (ICD)  Number  1,  "Policy  Directive  for  Intelligence Community Leadership”. 1.2.  Purpose.  Government  agencies  continually  assess  current  performance,  identify opportunities for performance improvement, and translate opportunities into specific actions. AF  leaders  are  called  upon  daily  to  make  decisions  across  the  AF,  often  without  being provided  objective  analysis  of  the  second  and  third  order  impacts  of  their  decisions. Enterprise  architectures  are  formal  blueprints  for  methodically  and  completely  defining  an organization’s  current  (baseline)  or  desired  (target)  operational  process  and  enabling environment.    It  is  a  tool  that  contains  information  for  use  by  decision-makers  in consideration  of  addressing  and  aligning  enterprise-wide  business  plans  and  programs. Enterprise  Architecture  (EA)  also  helps  all  echelons  to  understand  their  alignment,  key processes, roles, critical information, and supporting enablers. Thus, architecture is the key to understanding  complexity  and  managing  change;  laying  out  the  complexity  of  AF  systems, processes  and  programs,  and  presenting  decision-makers  with  clear  articulated  analysis.  Architecting provides a traceable connection from business strategy to each decision through implementation and deployment.   This AFI provides the roles and responsibilities required to ensure all architectures are built for purpose, built to quality standards, enable analysis that can be used to support decision making, and guide transformation. 1.3.  A  Federated  Approach.  The  AF  uses  a  federated  approach  that  partitions  the  AF Enterprise into an inter-related hierarchy of architectures (such as AF Service Core Function (SCF)  architectures,  Domain  architectures,  and  Program  architectures).    AF  Service  Core Function  architectures  express  the  ways  in  which  the  Air  Force  is  particularly  and appropriately suited to contribute to national security.  The SCF Architectures, along with the AF  Business  Support  Services,  depict  the  relationships  between  AF  capabilities,  functional support,  and  other  DoD  and  external  agencies.    The  Domain  architectures  are  those architectures  which  reflect  a  segment  of  one  or  more  AF  Service  Core  Functions  and depicting a set of capabilities and its associated missions, tasks, and their interrelationships.  The Program architectures are those architectures which reflect the programs, systems and or services  which  provide  IT  support  to  the  Domains  and  Service  Core  Functions.    These architectures  are  developed  and  managed  by  various  AF  organizations  (e.g.,  Service  Core Function  Lead  Integrator  Commands,  Major  Commands  (MAJCOM),  Field  Operating Agencies  (FOA),  and  Program  Offices  etc.).  The  specific  focus  and  layered  nature  of  the architectures  facilitate  allocation  of  responsibilities  and  enable  architectures  to  be  built autonomously. Architectures must be compliant with other interdependent architectures and the  Air  Force  Enterprise  Architecture  (AFEA).  Architectures  in  each  successive  layer  must provide its  area  of  responsibility  and  articulate interdependencies  to  other  architectures.  An  architecture  that  is  certified  as  compliant  with the  AFEA  can  be  used  to  certify  compliance  of  subordinate  architectures  under  certain conditions  (see  section  1.6.2.    Architecture  Certification),  thus  providing  architecture certification  reciprocity.  In  this  way,  an  architecture  at  the  lowest  level  of  an  enterprise  is compliant  with  the  highest  federated  level  of  an  enterprise  simply  by  complying  with  the level  immediately  above  it.    For  the  AF,  this  concept  extends  upward  from  the  AFEA  to Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  and  Federal  Enterprise  Architecture  (FEA)  as  the  AFEA  is deemed compliant with the  DoD EA and the FEA. the  detail  necessary to  fulfill   4  AFI33-401  17 MAY 2011 1.3.1.  The architecture community leverages subject matter expertise throughout the AF, to enable the development of architectures that support analysis and decision making. We achieve this by using the appropriate perspectives to ensure a linkage between the service or  component  level  strategy,  associated  objectives,  performance  measures,  their  related processes,  and  the  activities  (core,  governing,  and  enabling)  of  the  AF.  This  is accomplished  by  building  architectures  that  follow  the  rules  of  AF  architecting  (e.g. architectures  that  fully  address  Doctrine,  Organization,  Training,  Materiel,  Leadership and  Education,  Personnel,  and  Facility  (DOTMLPF)  considerations,  address  horizontal and  vertical  interdependencies,  and  are  built  to  enable  federation  [federate-able])  as described in this instruction. 1.3.2.  Designation of AF architecting areas of responsibility follows Figure 1 and begins with the AFEA which is assigned to the AF Chief Architect. Designation of architecting areas of responsibility at the next lower level is by AF Core Functions Lead Integrators (CFLIs) plus Business Support Services. The Business Support Services area is assigned to and managed by the AF Deputy Chief Management Office (DCMO). Lead Integrators and DCMO will work with HAF/SAF Functionals to define architecture requirements for Service  Core  Functions  and  the  Business  Support  Services  area  and  the  levels  of decomposition of each.  This will be reflected in their domain level architectures.  At the domain  level  and  below,  architecting  areas  of  responsibility  lie  with  the MAJCOM  and associated Program Offices. It is important to note that Domain architectures may support several SCFs, and likewise Program Architectures may support multiple Domains.  It is the responsibility of the lead architecting organizations to ensure interfaces are negotiated appropriately to enable the Federated Approach. 1.3.3.  Figure  1  -  Architecture  Federation  depicts the  AFEA  relationship  with architectures that are higher and lower in the hierarchy. The layers depicted run from the Federal  Enterprise  Architecture  (FEA),  through  the  DoD  and  the  AF,  down  to  an  SCF level, a Domain  Level which sub-divides any given SCF, and the Program  Level where program  architectures reside. Architectures in  each layer must comply with the relevant rules  for  architecting,  the  relevant  compliance  criteria  from  above  in  the  hierarchy  that guide the content of the architecture (such as standards), and must represent operational interdependencies  resulting  in  an  architecture  that  is  federate-able.  An  architecture  is federated into architectures above in the hierarchy by the organization responsible for the architecture  above  in  the  hierarchy.  This  pattern  must  be  followed  down  the  hierarchy resulting  in  traceability  from  the  Federal  Enterprise  Architecture  to  the  program  level architectures.  The  AFEA  is  built  to  be  federate-able  with  DoD  Enterprise  Architecture and in turn the DoD EA is built to be federate-able to the FEA. AFI33-401  17 MAY 2011   5  Figure 1.  Architecture Federation.  1.3.4.  The AF Enterprise Architecture.  The AFEA, maintained by SAF/A6PA, does not exist in isolation, but is part of (and must conform to) the larger DoD EA and FEA.  The AFEA defines how capabilities are met or intended to  be met and documents processes and/or systems to support those capabilities.  Enterprise architecting in the context of this policy encompasses all activities involved in developing, certifying, approving, and using federated architectures at all levels of the Air Force.  It includes information from other DoD,  Intelligence  and  AF  architectures,  National  Institute  of  Standards  Module Validation  List,  National  Information  Assurance  Partnership  Validated  Products  List, DoD  Metadata  Repository,  Net-Centric  Enterprise  Services  Service  Registry,  DoD Issuances Website, DoD Enterprise Software Initiative Web Site, AF Enterprise IT Data Repository  (EITDR),  AF  e-Publishing,  DISR,  the  Infostructure  Technology  Reference Model  (i-TRM),  Federal  Enterprise  Architecture,  DoD  BEA,  DoD  IEA,  DoD  Strategic Management  Plan,  AF  Strategic  Plan,  and  the  AF  Strategic  Management  Plan.    The AFEA  registers  its  Overview  and  Summary  Information  (AV-1)  with  DARS,  per  OSD mandated requirement. 1.3.5.  The Air Force Architecture Resource (AFAR).  AFAR is the authoritative source for AF  architecture information  and is  the repository  for architecture data and metadata describing  all  approved,  certified,  and/or  under-development  AF  architectures.    Using AFAR in this way ensures full lifecycle traceability, as well as visibility of architectures from  initial  development  through  certification  and  approval.    Additionally,  the  AFAR will include contact information on all architects throughout the AF. 1.3.6.  The Defense Architecture Repository System (DARS).  DARS-required metadata elements will be provided by each architecting organization submitting their architecture for approval and certification.  SAF/A6PA will register the architecture and its associated required architecture metadata with DARS under the AF community after certification.   6  AFI33-401  17 MAY 2011 1.4.  Using  Architectures.  The  AF  will  use  architecture  to  maximize  its  contribution  to  full spectrum dominance for the joint warfighter by supporting AF decision-making at all levels and guiding the transformations necessary to implement the decisions. AF architectures guide the  transformations  to  ensure  solutions  support  the  business  /  mission  need  and  deliver  the required  capability  while  supporting  CIO  requirements.  For  example,  AF  architectures  will be used to ensure that proposed spending is optimized as appropriate and that solutions meet the targeted performance improvement upon which the decision to proceed was founded. 1.5.  Building Architectures. The AF will build architectures specifically to support decision makers  and  decision  making  processes,  and  to  guide  potential  transformation.  The  AF  will build  architectures  to  a  minimum  standard  and  must  adhere  to  approved  DoD  architecture frameworks  as  directed  by  DoD  or  AF  policy  (e.g.,  DoDAF,  etc.)  or  as  appropriate  (e.g., FEAF).  Architectures will be developed to this minimum standard to ensure that a common set of information can be readily shared throughout the AF as described in this document. AF organizations  must  build  architectures  in  accordance  with  a  documented  or  referenced architecture development process and plan which must explicitly include meeting the needs of decision makers associated with the area of responsibility. 1.6.  Governing  Architectures.    The  AF  will  govern  the  quality  of  architecture  and architecting activity through approval and certification processes to ensure that architectures are of significant quality for decision making and adhere to the rules of AF architecting. 1.6.1.  Architecture Approval.  AF Architectures will be approved as Fit for Purpose  by designated Architecture Approval Authorities. Architecture Approval Authorities will be assigned by the owning MAJCOM or HAF/SAF Functional office with notification to the AF Chief Architect.  The Architecture Approval Authority will direct a thorough review of  the  architecture  which  includes  stakeholders.    The  Architecture  Review  Process  may be formal or informal  depending on the scope of the project.   The results of the review will  be  given  to  the  Architecture  Approval  Authority,  with  a  recommendation  for approval or with recommended improvements. 1.6.1.1.  Architecture approval criteria.  Approval criteria are used to assess whether any given architecture is Fit for Purpose.  Fit for Purpose also ensures an architecture has  sufficient  information  to  support  decision  making  (such  as  DOTMLPF  impacts, standards,  and  interoperability  requirements;  and  that  relevant  laws,  regulations  and policies  are  adequately  addressed).    In  addition,  architectures  must  capture  and represent  the  desired  end  state  and  performance  with  sufficient  data  to  guide  the transformation.  Architecture Approval  Authorities will provide a signed architecture approval letter indicating the architecture has been reviewed by an appropriate body of stakeholders and deemed Fit for Purpose. The architecture approval letter will have an attachment documenting the assessment leading to the architecture approval.  The AF Architecture Approval letter template is available on the AFAR. The AF will not prescribe  any  given  method  for  reviewing  an  architecture  for  approval  as  there  are many methods available  - each with  their own strengths.  For example, some openly available methods include:  the Architecture Tradeoff and Analysis Method (ATAM), the  Software  Architecture  Analysis  Method  (SAAM),  and  the  Active  Reviews  for Intermediate  Design  (ARID)  method.    Specific  architecture  approval  criteria  are dependent on the given purpose of the architecture; however the list below is a good baseline: AFI33-401  17 MAY 2011   7  1.6.1.1.1.  Decision  Making:  Architecture  should  be  assessed  for  completeness and accuracy in context to supporting specific decisions.  Full DOTMLPF review is  one dimension of completeness.  Addressing the mission, information,  service, and technology areas are another dimension. Additionally the architecture should be  assessed  for  its  accessibility  to  decision  makers  and/or  their  support  staff. Additionally  architectures  should  be  used  to  identify  gaps  and  redundancies across the enterprise to inform investment decisions. 1.6.1.1.2.  Architecture  Feasibility:  The  architecture  should  be  assessed  for technical feasibility, business feasibility, and financial feasibility. 1.6.1.1.3.  Architecture  Integrity:  The  architecture  should  be  assessed  for consistency  between  the  mission/business,  information,  service,  and  technology areas and their connections. 1.6.1.1.4.  Architecture Agility: The architecture should be assessed for its ability to accommodate alternatives based on changes in environment. 1.6.1.1.5.  Interoperable:  The  architecture  should  be  assessed  to  ensure  that solution  requirements  for  interoperability  are  appropriately  represented  and  that standard  interfaces  (internal  and  external)  utilize  standardized  vocabularies (reference  DoDD  4630.8).    Assertions  for  interoperability  will  be  demonstrated and  supported  through  the  architecture  as  directed  by  the  appropriate  approval authority. 1.6.1.1.6.  Dependable: The architecture should be assessed to ensure the solution meets  the  requirement.  This  will  be  stated  through  performance  measures  based on  OMB  A-11  and  Federal  Enterprise  Architecture  (FEA)  Consolidated Reference  Model  (CRM)  requirements.    These  requirements  and  associated performance  measures  should  address  solution  manageability,  recoverability  and serviceability. 1.6.1.1.7.  Useable:  The  architecture  should  be  assessed  for  human  factors (Section 508, ADA), including hardware, software, and human systems (computer and machine) integration and interactions. 1.6.1.1.8.  Prepared for Certification: The architecture should be assessed against certification  criteria.    The  certification  assertions  should  be  prepared  using  the certification  scorecard  (available  on  AFAR)  as  an  input  to  the  certification process. 1.6.1.1.9.  Security:  The  architecture  should  be  assessed for  adequate representation  of  security  issues  to  support  trusted  relationships  with  partners driven by policy. 1.6.1.1.10.  Technically  Compliant:  The  architecture  should  be  assessed  from  a technical  and  overall  design  perspective  seeking  to  understand  whether  the  right technical  approaches  are  being  applied  for  the  given  solution  requirements  and whether the collection of technologies will work together seamlessly.   8  AFI33-401  17 MAY 2011 1.6.1.1.11.  Compliant  with  appropriate  Law,  Regulation  and  Policy  (LRP): Architecture  will  address  the  LRPs  and  their  associated  review,  inspection,  or audit requirements based on the architectures stated purpose and scope. 1.6.1.1.12.  Stakeholder  Involvement:    The  stakeholders  are  included  in  the approval  process,  for  example,  AFSPC/AFNIC  for  capacity,  compliance,  and supportability. 1.6.2.  Architecture  Certification.        AF  Architectures  will  be  certified  by  the  Air  Force Chief  Architect  or  a  designated  Architecture  Certification  Authority.  Certification  is required  for  any  architecture  that  has  interdependencies  with  other  architectures.  Certification  ensures  architectures  address  AF  rules  for  architecting,  as  presented  in  the AF  Enterprise  Architecture  (AFEA)  Compliance  Guidance  to  meet  interoperability support requirements as the AF moves toward an optimal set of capabilities. 1.6.2.1.  The goal of AF Architecture Certification is to maintain a minimum common standard of Architecture across the Air Force.  Accomplishing this goal will assist the AF Architecture to achieve multiple objectives: 1.6.2.1.1.  The architecture meets a minimum common standard. 1.6.2.1.1.1.  Discoverable information assets are captured in the Architecture. 1.6.2.1.1.2.  Reusable information assets are captured in the Architecture. 1.6.2.1.2.  The architecture has addressed appropriate compliance requirements. 1.6.2.1.3.  The architecture is Fit-for-Federation (F4F). 1.6.2.1.3.1.  The architecture supports decisions at or above the program level. 1.6.2.1.3.2.  The  architecture  support  analysis  (i.e.  such  as  interoperability, redundancy, DOTMLPF impacts, etc.). 1.6.2.1.3.3.  The  Federation  of  architectures  provides  a  means  to  address  Air Force Organization / Enterprise issues. 1.6.2.2.  Certification  of  architectures  is  intended  to  streamline  the  architecture development process over time by reducing rework and lowering costs of integration and interoperation. 1.6.2.3.  The  Architecture  Certification  Authority  will  provide  a  signed  architecture certification  letter  indicating  the  architecture  has  been  reviewed  and  that  the architecture  meets  /  does  not  meet  minimum  criteria  for  certification.    The architecture certification letter will have an attachment documenting the certification results which will be presented in a scorecard that rates the architecture against each criterion.    This  scorecard  will  note  any  material  weaknesses  found  in  the  assessed architecture, along with a “get well plan” that describes the criteria / requirements that need to be addressed.  The scorecard and any associated “get well plan” will comprise the attachment. The Certification Letter and Scorecard templates are available on the AFAR. AFI33-401  17 MAY 2011   9  1.6.2.4.  Certification will address the following eight (8) criteria: 1.6.2.4.1.  Architecture  Approval  process  was  conducted:  The  architecture  has been approved based on specific criteria and approval has followed a documented process. 1.6.2.4.2.  The  Architecture  content  is  valid:  The  architecture  contains  valid data/information. 1.6.2.4.3.  Architecture  is  positioned  to  support  decisions:  The  architecture  has been assessed for how it supports the defined consumers (purpose) and decisions it will be informing. 1.6.2.4.4.  Architecture  is  positioned  to  be  federated  within  the  Air  Force Enterprise  Architecture:  Architecture  has  related  or  aligned  subordinate  and parent  architectures  via  the  mapping  of  common  architecture  information.  Architecture artifacts are visible and accessible to analysts, planners and decision makers at all levels. 1.6.2.4.5.  Architecture  is  compliant  with  laws,  regulations,  and  policies:    The architecture  has  addressed  compliance  requirements  based  on  the  stated  purpose and scope. 1.6.2.4.6.  Architecture  meets  a  minimum  standard  (discovery  and  use):    The architecture has been developed to a minimum standard of architecting to ensure architecture information is authoritative, discoverable and useable. 1.6.2.4.7.  Architecture  meets  a  minimum  AF  standard  (traceability):  The architecture  has  been  developed  to  a  minimum  standard  to  deliver  auditable processes  that  maintain  traceability  from  NEED  to  Deployed  Capability  -  the solution meets the architecture and the need! 1.6.2.4.8.  Architecture  is  under  configuration  control:  The  architecture  is  static upon approval and has identified a process to  evolve and maintain configuration of architecture information. 1.6.2.5.  AF  architecture  certification  results  will  be  reported  through  AFAR.  This will include the certification letter and associated certification scorecard with results. 1.6.2.6.  Designating Additional Certification Authorities.  The AF Chief Architect is the primary architecture certification authority and will certify AF architectures.  To enable  tiered-accountability,  the  AF  Chief  Architect  may  delegate  authority  to architecting organizations at lower levels of the AF Enterprise to certify subordinate architectures.    Organizations  will  not  certify  architectures  they  have  created  or sponsored  themselves  as  those  must  be  submitted  to  the  next  higher  certification authority. 1.7.  IT  and  NSS  Standards.    As  with  DoD  architectures  and  the  AFEA,  adherence  to approved technical standards is required.  The DoD IT Standards Registry (DISR) mandates the  minimum  set  of  standards  and  guidelines  for  the  acquisition  of  all  DoD  systems  that produce,  use,  or  exchange  information.    In  accordance  with  DoDI  4630.8  Procedures  for Interoperability  and  Supportability  of  Information  Technology  (IT)  and  National  Security   10  AFI33-401  17 MAY 2011 Systems (NSS), and AFI 63-101 Acquisition and Sustainment Lifecycle Management, all AF architectures shall use the DoD-mandated IT standards found in the DISR. 1.7.1.  To add, update or delete a standard currently in the DISR, a change request must be  submitted  to  the  DISR  for  consideration  by  DISR  Technical  Working  Group representatives  after  coordination  with  SAF/A6PA.    To  use  an  emerging  or  retired standard or to disregard a DoD-mandated IT standard requires a waiver.  The process for change  requests  or  waivers  is  available  on  the  AF  Information  Technology  Standards Management web site (see references). 1.7.2.

Purpose:  The  Air  Force  Architecture  Executive  Committee  (AEC)  will  guide  the development and use of Air Force enterprise architecture (EA) to enhance the understanding of   24  AFI33-401  17 MAY 2011 operational  and  technical  relationships  within  the  USAF  and  provide  direction  and  context  for change.  The  AEC  is  the  AF’s  architecture  governance  body  that  guides,  reviews  and  approves architectures as  well as  advises and informs the  AF CIO by leveraging  AF architecture data to provide  relevant  information  for  decision  making.  The  AEC  will  facilitate  an  enterprise architecture strategy for requirements planning, portfolio management and product development in  alignment  to  the  Air  Force  core  missions  and  in  support  of  SAF/CIO  A6  Mission  Area Integrators (MAI). The AEC allows the AF Chief Enterprise Architect (CEA) to carry out duties outlined  in  AFI  33-401.  The  AEC  goal  is  to  act  as  a  decision-  making  body  that  collectively establishes  a  relevant  and  accessible  AFEA.  The  group  will  exercise  effective  and  efficient configuration control of the AFEA, and share best practices across the Air Force. AF Enterprise Architecture purpose: The purpose of the AFEA is to enhance mission effectiveness, security and information assurance, financial efficiencies, and to influence future technology transitions through guided investment portfolio strategies and decisions based on joint capability and interoperability requirements and defined standards. A2.2.  Scope:  The  AEC  scope  includes  the  Air  Force  Enterprise  Architecture  (AFEA)  and architectures  across  the  entire  Air  Force  from  the  Business  Mission  Area  (BMA),  Warfighting Mission  Area  (WMA),  DoD  portion  of  the  Intelligence  Mission  Area  (DIMA)  and  the Information  Enterprise  Mission  Area  (IEMA)  otherwise  identified  as  Enterprise  Information Environment  Mission  Area  (EIEMA)  as  defined  by  DoDD  8115.01,  October  10,  2005  DoDI 8115.02, October 30, 2006, CJCSI 8410.01, 22 June 2007 and DoDI 8510.01, March 12, 2014.

Meetings  will  be virtual. The agenda will be finalized 72 hours prior to the AEC meeting. If a vote is expected, every  attempt  will  be  made  to  get  supporting  materials  out  with  the  agenda.  If  no  vote  is expected,  then  read-aheads  will  be  sent  out  at  least  24  hours  in  advance  of  the  meeting. Meetings that require decisions of the AEC will be duly noted in the agenda with every effort made  to  ensure  ample  time  for  review  and  consideration.  As  a  precedent,  votes  will  most often occur within a defined period of time (i.e. 14 days) following the AEC. A2.7.2.  AEC voting members will conduct a simple majority vote. One AEC member from each of the voting member organizations may participate in voting. If an organization is not available  to  participate  in  the  vote,  the  member  may  email  their  intention  to  the  AEC Secretariat in advance of the meeting.  If an organization is not present, or has not provided their vote to the AEC Secretariat in advance of the meeting, a “did not vote” will be entered. In the event of a tie, the AF CEA will cast the deciding vote. In order to call for a vote, the AF  CEA,  the  AEC  Chair,  and  at  least  half  of  the  voting  member  body  must  be  present,  or have  provided  their  vote  in  writing  prior  to  the  meeting.

Develop an EA strategic communications plan.    30  AFI33-401  17 MAY 2011 AIR FORCE DATA PANEL (AFDP) TERMS OF REFERENCE (TOR) Attachment 3 A3.1.  Establishment.  This  document  establishes  the  Air  Force  Data  Panel  (AFDP)  as  the subordinate  governance  forum  under  the  Architecture  Executive  Committee  (AEC)  that  is charged  with  improving  how  data,  information,  and  associated  Information  Technology  (IT) services  are  visible,  accessible,  understandable,  trustworthy,  and  interoperable  across  the  Air Force.  The  AEC  is  chartered  by  the  AF  Chief  Enterprise  Architect  under  the  authorities  in  the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 8330.01, Interoperability of Information Technology (IT), including National Security Systems (NSS). A3.2.  Purpose.  The  AFDP  serves  as  the  Air  Force’s  directive  body  for  development  of  the coordinated enterprise position on data strategy and standards. The AFDP also guides the use of resources  for  implementing  the  sharing  of  data,  information,  and  associated  IT  services  within the  DoD  Information  Enterprise  and  with  mission  partners  as  outline  in  the  Department  of Defense  Instruction  (DoDI)  8320.02,  Sharing  Data,  Information,  and  Information  Technology (IT) Services in the Department of Defense. A3.2.1.  This  panel  serves as the Air Force’s adjudication body for data issues, coordinated data- sharing efforts across the Air Force enterprise, and collection and dissemination of best practices  and  lessons  learned  for  the  data  community  (DoDI  8320.02,  Sharing  Data, Information, and Information Technology (IT) Services in the Department of Defense). A3.2.2.  This panel will also serve as the Air Force governance body that oversees the proper registration of authoritative data sources (ADSs) for the Air Force. Reliable, accessible ADSs are critical to trustworthy data and information. An ADS is established when producers and consumers  recognize  a  match  between  data  needs,  data  sources,  and  data  assets.    ADS designation  and  registration  includes  policy,  process,  and  technical  access  agreements. Formal  designation  of  an  ADS  thus  supports  the  policy  agreement  that  producers  and consumers need, assuring producers that their data will be protected, and assuring consumers that  their  data  needs  will  be  met.  The  process  of  ADS  designation  also  helps  reduce  the number  of  unmanaged  duplicative  data  sources,  saving  money  on  the  producer  side  while reducing the incidence of conflicting answers on the consumer side.  Designating and using ADSs  where  possible  improves  mission  effectiveness  by  enabling  the  reuse  of  visible, accessible,  understandable,  trustworthy,  and  interoperable  data  (DoD  Data  Framework Strategy, 1 January 2014). A3.3.  Functions.  The AFDP shall perform the following functions: A3.3.1.  Recommend the establishment of policies, standards, processes, formats, references, and  tools  for  creating  and  delivering  Data  Management  (DM)  products  and  vocabularies. This  includes  the  Air  Force  requirements  and  position  regarding  the  standards-based approach  to  exchanging  information  such  as  the  National  Information  Exchange  Model (NIEM). A3.3.2.  Promote standards leading to visibility of data to support global mission operations, analytics and daily decision-making. A3.3.3.  Sponsor  organizational  use  case  data  problems/operational  questions  for  AFDP review/selection. The AFDP  will select  and address  use cases with the intent of  addressing AFI33-401  17 MAY 2011   31  issues  the  resolution  of  which  will  yield  enterprise-wide  benefit  in  terms  of  operational  or business process effectiveness and lessons learned. A3.3.4.  Identify metrics that indicate how Air Force authoritative data is visible, accessible, understandable, trustworthy and interoperable. A3.3.5.  Identify, resolve, and elevate data issues unresolved at lower levels. A3.3.6.  Provide  oversight  and  articulate  procedures  for  configuration  management  of  any Air  Force  namespace  and  Authoritative  Bodies  (AB)  as  specified  in  DoD  Data  Services Environment  Concept  of  Operations  (CONOPS),  2  August  2013  and  DoD  Data  Services Environment User Manual, Version 2.2.3. A3.3.6.1.  AB’s within their functional purview will ensure proper registration of ADSs. An  ADS  is  a  recognized  or  official  data  production  source  with  a  designated  mission statement  or  source/product  to  publish  reliable  and  accurate  data  for  subsequent  use  by data  consumers.  An  ADS  may  be  the  functional  combination  of  multiple,  separate backend databases, data feeds, systems, or other data sources. A3.4.  Framework.  Proposed Objectives: A3.4.1.  Understand the business processes such that required data is identified. A3.4.2.  Determine the single, unique  ADS for  each element  of required  data, and  formally designated that ADS.  Duplicate sources and unnecessary data sources are deprecated. A3.4.3.  Ensure each ADS is managed by a designated data steward. A3.4.4.  Ensure tiered standards for data quality are defined and applied to each ADS based on the level of importance. A3.4.5.  Establish  Air  Force  DM  policies,  procedures,  roles  and  responsibilities,  standards and  standard  frameworks  to  protect  data,  information,  and  associated  IT  services  while enabling their secure sharing as strategic assets. A3.4.6.  Establish  common,  consistent  processes  with  standard  naming  conventions  to centrally manage data as an enterprise asset. A3.5.  Organization  and  Membership.  The  AFDP  membership  consists  of  two  categories: Voting  and  Advisory.  Each  member  of  the  AFDP  has  equities  in  AF-wide  data  standards, processes,  and  procedures  to  foster  improvement  of  information  exchange  across  the  DoD  and with its mission partners. The AFDP members will operate under the leadership and authority of the  Air  Force  Chief  Technology  Officer  (CTO).  The  Air  Force  CTO  will  serve  as  the  AFDP Chair. The SAF/CIO A6SA will provide Secretariat services for the AFDP. A3.5.1.
