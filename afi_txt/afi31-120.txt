(T-2) 1.3.  Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS). 1.3.1.  DIBRS  is  primarily  a  reporting  system  covering  all  active  duty,  reserve,  federal employees,  family  members  and  guard  military  personnel.  DIBRS  is  DoD’s  centralized reporting system to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). It implements reporting requirements of: 1.3.1.1.  Section  534  of  Title  28,  United  States  Code  (also  known  as  “The  Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act of 1988”) (Reference (c)). 1.3.1.2.  The victim and witness assistance notifications of Sections 10601 through 10608 of Title 42 (also known as “The Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990”) (Reference (d)). 1.3.1.3.  Section  922  of  Title  18,  United  States  Code  (also  known  as  “The  Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and The Lautenberg Amendment to the Gun Control Act”) (Reference (e)).   10  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 1.3.1.4.  Sections  16901  through  16928  of  Title  42,  United  States  Code  (also  known  as “The  Jacob  Wetterling,  Megan  Nicole  Kanka  and  Pam  Lychner  Sex  Offender Registration and Notification Program”) (Reference (f)). 1.3.1.5.  Public Law 107-188 (Reference (g)). 1.3.1.6.  The  establishment  of  a  central  Air  Force  database  on  domestic  violence incidents. 1.3.2.  Active,  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard  Security  Forces  units  will  comply  with  the reporting  requirements  mandated  by  Congress  and  outlined  in  DoDD  7730.47,  Defense Incident-Based  Reporting  System  (DIBRS),  and  DoD  7730.47-M  Volume  1,  Manual  for Defense  Incident-Based  Reporting  System.  For  definitions  of  reportable  incidents,  refer  to DoD 7730.47-M, Volume 2, Manual for Defense Incident-Based Reporting System. (T-0) 1.3.3.  DIBRS reporting  is  triggered when Security Forces respond to  a  credible report of a criminal incident. Typically, any Security Forces response which requires more than an AF Form  1168,  Statement  of  Suspect,  Witness  or  Victim,  requires  a  report  to  ensure  DIBRS reporting.  Security  Forces  shall  collect to  fulfill  reporting responsibilities, including the data required by NIBRS. information  necessary 1.3.3.1.  If  a  military  member  commits  a  crime  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  the  federal government  (e.g.,  civilian  police  agency),  DIBRS  reporting  is  still  required.  Civil agencies  will  typically  complete  NIBRS  reporting,  but  not  DIBRS.  In  these  instances, Security Forces will complete the DIBRS requirement. (T-0) 1.3.3.2.  In  the  event  an  agency  (e.g.,  Defense  Criminal  Investigative  Organizations, Federal  Bureau of  Investigations (FBI), or AFOSI) with jurisdiction takes responsibility for a criminal incident, DIBRS reporting passes to them. Security Forces must not report information in these situations to prevent double reporting in DIBRS. (T-0) 1.3.4.  DIBRS  submissions  must  be  completed  by  the  15th  day  of  each  month.  DIBRS submissions  pending  final  action,  to  include  the  report  of  commander’s  action,  must  be tracked until final disposition. (T-0) 1.3.4.1.  Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units will run their reports once a month. This can be accomplished by the DFC appointed SFMIS monitor or the alternate. (T-0) 1.3.4.2.  ANG and AFRC Security Forces units which are co-located on active duty Air Force  bases  will  not  run  the  Criminal  Summary  Report.  These  entities  will  forward  the DIBRS-reportable  information  to  the  active  duty  host  Security  Forces  unit,  who  will perform  the  computer  run  of  the  previous  month’s  Criminal  Summary  Report.  ANG Security  Forces  units  that  are  co-located  on  sister  service  installations  will  forward DIBRS reportable information to the host Law and Order/Provost Marshal’s Office.  (T-2) 1.3.5.  Units must identify and correct DIBRS errors. DIBRS errors occur when information placed into SFMIS is  incorrect.  SFMIS will give a visual warning to  the  user indicating  an error on the page where data is entered. (T-2) 1.3.6.  The AF Form 3545A or Report of  Investigation (ROI) records the data reportable to the DMDC for DIBRS submission. Incidents not covered by DIBRS will be documented and AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   11  reported  under  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  guidelines.  NOTE:  Reports  of  Survey (ROS) are often related to the theft, loss or damage of government property, which are also usually DIBRS reportable. An ROS can be added to an AF Form 3545 as an attachment. The purpose  of  an  ROS  is  to  determine  if  the  person  is  accountable  for  the  item  and  does  not establish  criminal  activity.  AF  Form  3545A  is  a  SFMIS  generated  incident  report.  An  AF Form 3545 is used at locations where SFMIS is  not available and can be downloaded from AF  e-Publishing.  Once  completed,  the  unit  then  forwards  the  report  to  the  subject’s  home station for upload in SFMIS. (T-1) 1.3.6.1.  The  SFMIS-generated  Incident  Report  Summary  (AF  Form  3545A)  or  an original AF Form 3545, with original signature or digital signature on the Commander’s Action page, is approved for use as the final file copy. 1.3.6.2.  The disposition of a commander’s action is mandatory for DIBRS reporting. On a yearly basis, DMDC provides DoD with DIBRS data on criminal statistics. One of the major  areas  reviewed  are  the  commander’s  action  reports.  A  list  of  the  commanders’ actions taken or not taken is required. To ensure Air Force compliance, SF unit FSAs will conduct a monthly review of all pending cases and attempt to finalize them. An incident is finalized when it is adjudicated and has the commander’s signature. (T-0) 1.4.  National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). 1.4.1.  NIBRS is  the overall reporting system DIBRS feeds into. NIBRS originated in  1930 as  the  Uniform  Crime  Reporting  (UCR)  Program.  The  UCR  data  is  used  by  the  FBI  to develop criminal statistics for law enforcement agencies throughout the country. 1.4.2.  NIBRS is comprised of six segments (e.g., Administrative Segment, Offense Segment, Property  Segment,  Victim  Segment,  Offender  Segment  and  Arrestee  Segment)  and  53  data elements. 1.4.3.  Security  Forces  must  input  information  from  civilians  who  commit  offenses  on  Air Force installations into NIBRS. (T-0) 1.5.  General Administrative Information. 1.5.1.  Assistance. The Field Assistance Service (FAS) provides assistance to Base Network Control Centers, Defense Mega Centers  and users worldwide. MAJCOM or local  FSA will create  new  user  accounts.  FSAs  will  be  appointed  via  appointment  letters  signed  by  their commander and a signed copy of the DD Form 2875, System Authorization Access Request (SAAR). A copy will be sent to the respective MAJCOM FSA and will be maintained IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). (T-3) 1.5.1.1.  Installations  may  have  four  FSAs  to  create  and  maintain  user  accounts.  The primary  and  alternate  FSAs  at  SF  squadrons  will  have  staff  level  access  and  overall responsibility of system use for the unit.  (T-3) 1.5.1.2.  If  additional  administrators  are  needed,  submit  a  request  in  writing  to  the MAJCOM FSA, who will notify AFSFC/SFOP for approval. (T-3) 1.5.2.  Contractors hired in an SF unit in a capacity requiring access to SFMIS are authorized to  be an FSA. They must  complete the same requirements for training  and authorization to use the system as military personnel and DoD employees. (T-0)   12  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 1.5.2.1.  Contractors  outside  of  this  requirement  are  not  authorized  unless  approved  in writing  by  AFSFC/SFOP.  MAJCOMs  will  provide  a  copy  of  appointment  letters  to AFSFC/SFOP, as well as a signed copy of the DD Form 2875. (T-0) 1.5.2.2.  Prior  to  foreign  nationals  being  authorized  access  to  and  use  of  Information Systems (ISs), they must meet the requirements IAW AFI 33-200, Information Assurance Management;  AFI 31-501, Personnel Security;  and AFSSI 8522,  Access  to  Information Systems. This includes the AF provisioned portion of the Global Information Grid (GIG) (e.g., unclassified base LAN). (T-0) 1.5.3.  FSAs  will  only  have  access  to  the  “System  Administrator”  module  in  SFMIS.  They must create another account to have access to the other modules without FSA rights. NOTE: Group accounts are NOT authorized. (T-0) 1.5.4.  Wing/Support Group Commanders, Staff Judge Advocate, AFOSI and Military Equal Opportunity  staff  may  request  “live”  access  to  SFMIS.  These  organizations  may  be  given read  only  access  with  DFC’s  Approval.  Approvals  must  be  in  writing  and  maintained  for record.  (T-2) 1.5.5.  SFMIS  is  Common  Access  Card  (CAC)  enabled.  In  order  to  access  SFMIS  with  a CAC card, it must be done through the AF Portal. The CAC card can only be associated with one user name. If multiple user names are required for your duty position, then users will be assigned user names/passwords for access and permissions commensurate with “the need to know” information within the system. Individual passwords will not be shared with other users.  It  is  a  system  security  violation  for  multiple  users  to  share  the  same  user  ID  and password.  Passwords  will  be  changed  at  least  every  60  calendar  days,  immediately  upon compromise or after 45 days of inactivity. SFMIS can identify the number of days remaining until a change of password is required. Audits of the system will be done annually for proper accountability to prevent misuse/abuse of the system and data. (T-1) 1.5.6.  Should  a  lockout  occur  as  a  result  of  an  improper  or  forgotten  password,  the MAJCOM or unit FSA will assign a new password; however, the account will remain locked for  a  period  of  one  hour  or  until  the  user’s  identity  can  be  positively  identified.  Users  who have  expired  accounts  must  have  their  passwords  reset  through  the  functional  system administrator.  If after duty hours, contact the AFPEO BES/Field Assistance Service (FAS) Team  5  at  DSN:  312-596-5771/COMM:  334-416-5771  then  select  option  #1,  then  select option  #5  and  then  option  #4.    If  requesting  assistance  through  the  AFPEO  BES/FAS, requestors will need to provide the FAS with an email with their SFMIS account user name, unit and DSN number.  MAJCOM FSAs can perform this function for unit FSAs. Unit FSAs can  perform  this  function  for  members  of  their  unit.  Problems  encountered  should  be forwarded to the AFPEO BES/FAS for resolution. If a problem cannot be resolved within a reasonable time (24 hours), ensure the user gets a trouble ticket from the FAS, which will be forwarded  to  the  SFMIS  Program  Manager’s  office,  until  the  problem  is  fixed.  If  users experience  log-in  problems  due  to  their  CAC,  please  refer  to  local  procedures  to  unlock CACs. 1.6.  Privacy Information.  All SFMIS data is protected by the Privacy Act and must be handled as For Official Use Only (FOUO). All information will be strictly controlled IAW AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy and  Civil Liberties Program, to  ensure it is  only released to  officials with  a need-to-know.  Individuals  may  access  SFMIS  for  authorized,  official  purposes  only. AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   13  Military  members  who  improperly  access  SFMIS  or  its  information  or  provide  or  enable such access  to third parties,  for other than official authorized purposes,  may be punished under Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and provisions  of federal  or state  law.  Civilian  personnel  who  improperly  access  SFMIS,  its  information,  provide,  or enable  such  access  to  third  parties,  for  other  than  official,  authorized  purposes,  may  be prosecuted  under  applicable  provisions  of  federal  or  state  law.    Violations  by  military  or civilian  members  may  result  in  the  full  range  of  authorized  administrative  and  disciplinary actions  in  addition  to  otherwise  applicable  criminal  or  civil  sanctions  for  violations  of  related laws. (T-0) 1.6.1.  All SFMIS users are required to read the SFMIS Rules of Behavior pertaining to their tasks of safeguarding SFMIS information and sign the Acknowledgment of Responsibilities. All units will keep the Acknowledgement of Responsibilities for personnel on file. A copy of the  Acknowledgement  of  Responsibilities  can  be  found  on  USAF  Security  Forces SMARTNet  NIPR-  https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil.  Units  can  use  this  form  or  a  locally generated memorandum that includes the same information to meet this requirement. (T-1) 1.6.2.  Units will maintain signed Acknowledgement of Responsibilities on file while SFMIS user accounts are active. When SFMIS user accounts are no longer active, the letter will be archived IAW the  Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). (T-1) 1.6.3.  All SFMIS users must be aware that data displayed on monitors may be susceptible to unauthorized viewing. Take appropriate action to ensure privacy data is always protected. (T-0) 1.6.4.  Violations  of  the  system’s  operation  or  unauthorized  release  of  the  “FOUO” information  will be immediately reported to  the local  FOIA office and  Unit FSA, who will notify the commander at each level of concern. (T-0) 1.7.  SFMIS  Capabilities.  SFMIS  operates  through  the  use  of  role-based  access,  granted  to authorize  users  at  all  levels  in  the  System  Administration  Module.  The  list  below  is  not  all inclusive and more features are added with each SFMIS release. Currently, the SFMIS program has the following capabilities: 1.7.1.

The  primary  capability  is  searching  for  statistics  which offers parameter setting for ad-hoc queries. 1.7.9.  AFSFC/SFOP periodically publishes information regarding SFMIS. This information will appear on the SFMIS “Message of the Day,” SMARTNet and/or be posted on periodic electronic  news  releases.  These  messages  inform  users  of  developments,  new  releases  and other  important  information.  Users  should  check  these  sources  for  updates  daily,  and  are highly encouraged to submit items to AFSFC/SFOP for future publication. 1.8.  On-Line Manual.  The SFMIS program has an online help manual available for users. The manual is user-friendly and can be printed for easy reference. Refer to DoD Instruction 7730.47-M  Volume  2  for  the  DIBRS/NIBRS  code  tables.  NOTE:  These  code  tables  are  subject  to change. DMDC controls the additions/deletions on the code tables. 1.9.  SFMIS  Training.  The  DFC  must  ensure  personnel  are  trained  to  use  SFMIS  to  meet installation needs and DIBRS requirements. Training and familiarization will not  be conducted using the SFMIS “live” system modules. (T-1) 1.9.1.  Web-Based Training (WBT). The SFMIS  WBT module provides  familiarization and refresher training. It is the primary means for familiarization training. WBT can be found on the  SF  SMARTNet.  The  primary  capability  is  an  interactive  step-by-step  process  for  each module on SFMIS. 1.9.2.  Help  Center.  The  SFMIS  Help  Center  page  provides  useful  information  regarding everyday use of the SFMIS program. The Help Center is broken into five categories: 1.9.2.1.  Contact  Info.  This  page  provides  contact  information  for  the  FAS,  MAJCOM and SFMIS Points of contact (POC). 1.9.2.2.  Important Settings and Configuration.

This section provides User Guides for numerous topics in each SFMIS Module. 1.10.  Erroneous Incident Report Entries (EIRE).  If erroneous information is entered into the SFMIS “live” site, users need to notify the S5R or their FSA. S5R will then notify the DFC and MAJCOM FSA of the EIRE prior to voiding/deleting information. After contact is made with the MAJCOM FSA, the following steps should be conducted to correct the ERIE:  (T-1) 1.10.1.  The affected unit’s DFC or delegate will contact the servicing Staff Judge Advocate (SJA)  regarding  the  EIRE  and  request  a  memorandum  acknowledging  the  EIRE.  The  SJA will accomplish a memorandum acknowledging the voiding/deleting of the EIRE, which will be  forwarded  to  the  unit’s  S5R  and  the  MAJCOM  FSA.  The  MAJCOM  FSA  will  then AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   15  forward  the  completed  memorandum  to  AFSFC/SFOP.  Both  MAJCOM  and  the  local  unit must maintain a copy of the memorandum. (T-1) 1.10.2.  After  the  memorandum  has  been  received  by  the  unit’s  S5R,  they  must  locate  and open the erroneous incident report(s). 1.10.3.  S5R  will  then  delete  all  personal  information  from  the  report  and  enter  a  brief synopsis,  concerning  the  reason  for  deletion  in  the  narrative  portion  of  the  incident  report panel and click the “Save” button. (T-1) 1.10.4.  After  completing  the  above  actions,  user  will  click  on  the  “Routing”  button  in  the incident panel to open the SFMIS Routing Dialog. 1.10.5.  Select “Voided” from the “pick list” and be sure to click the “Save” button. 1.11.  Requests for SFMIS Information and Releasing SF Information to the Public. 1.11.1.  IAW DoDI 5505.17, Collection, Maintenance, Use and Dissemination of Personally Identifiable  Information  and  Law  Enforcement  Information  by  DoD  Law  Enforcement Activities,  daily  law  enforcement  operations  include  collecting  personal  information  on  the public, which must be safeguarded according to DoD. Follow AFI 33-332, and DoD 5400.7-R AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program. (T-0) 1.11.2.  All first party requests will be directed to the unit’s S5R section; no other SF office will provide this information unless designated by the DFC in writing and those individuals have  been  trained  IAW  paragraph  1.11.3.  All  third  party  requests  will  be  forwarded  to  the local  FOIA  office.  Contact  the  FOIA  office  at  the  installation  for  further  guidance  and assistance.  Individuals  or  agencies  desiring  copies  of  reports  (to  include  enclosures)  or Security Forces blotters will do the following: (T-3) 1.11.2.1.  If the requester desires copies of statements, they must submit a request under the  Privacy  Act  (AFI  33-332)  or  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act,  as  required  by  DOD 5400.7, as supplemented. 1.11.2.2.  Insurance  companies  requesting  case  reports  concerning  clients  will  make  the request in writing. Units will assess a fee per DOD Regulation, 7000.14-R, Volume 11a, Reimbursable  Operations,  Policy  and  Procedures.  Company  checks  will  be  used  and made payable to Base Finance and mailed to the local SFAR office. Turn over checks to Finance  using  DD  FM  1131,  Cash  Collection  Voucher.

Individuals  seeking  information  to  include  statistical information must send the request to the servicing installation FOIA office. The requester can go  to  http://www.foia.af.mil/  for  information  on  how  to  submit  a  request.  NOTE:  If  an insurance  company  uses  another  company  to  request  information,  this  is  considered  a  third party request and must go through FOIA. 1.11.7.  Government  Agency  Requests.  The  following  are  procedures  for  release  of information: 1.11.7.1.  S5R  is  authorized  to  release  information  within  their  installation  and  will coordinate with DFC before information is released. (T-3) 1.11.7.2.  MAJCOMs  are  authorized  to  release  information  within  respective  units  of responsibility. 1.11.7.3.  HQ AFSFC is authorized to release AF information. 1.11.7.4.  The DFC is authorized to determine information sharing with other government agencies for statistical  reports, the requests must  be submitted and  recorded.   Statistical information can be released but cannot have any PII information included in the report. If PII information is required, the request must be sent to the local FOIA office. (T-2) 1.11.7.5.  Law  enforcement  agencies  can  request  information  with  an  official  request  to local  installations or MAJCOMs.   IAW Title 10 USC Chapter 18, Military Support For Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, USA PATRIOT Act (P.L. 107-56), and AFI 31- AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   17  101,  information  sharing  between  intelligence  and  law  enforcement  agencies  is authorized. Each request will receive DFC approval, and all requests will be recorded. (T-3) 1.11.7.6.  : Requests for SFMIS data submitted by federal government agencies (outside of  law  enforcement  activity)  are  also  addressed  as  a  functional  use/official  use  request directly  by  the  record  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility.    Requests  for  SFMIS  data submitted by a state or local agency (outside of law enforcement activity) should be sent to the local FOIA office for appropriate review and action. Police or government agencies (e.g.  Drug  Enforcement  Agency,  Recruiters,  Family  Advocacy)  requesting  information for official reasons will receive all requested information after the identity of the agency can be verified. Such requests must be made either in person upon proper identification or using official letterhead. The written request can be mailed, scanned/emailed or faxed. Ensure the requester is advised to include points of contact, mailing addresses and phone or  fax  numbers  to  ensure  a  prompt  response.  Ensure  requesters  are  authorized  release under  the  Privacy  Act  (AFI  33-332)  before  disclosing  the  information.  The  requester‘s letter will be attached to  the case files/blotters for a matter of record. Responses can be mailed,  emailed  or  faxed  back.  The  unit  will  maintain  a  log  to  verify  action  was completed. For investigators conducting military/federal background checks, the local SF unit  will  establish  local  policy/guidance  on  how  this  information  is  requested  by investigators  and  tracked  by  the  local  Reports  and  Analysis  Clerk.  Requests  from  any Federal agency are required to apply for requests through the proper channels and have a valid need to know. (T-2) 1.11.7.7.  MAJCOMs and Installation Commanders/DFCs may pull their own statistics to obtain  criminal  patterns  or  brief  personnel  on  criminal  activity  for  their  installations.  If MAJCOMs or installations need information from other MAJCOMs or installations, they must  request  the  information  in  writing  to  the  location  desired  or  contact  HQ AFSFC/SFOP.  Statistical  information  may  not  be  released  without  AFNETOPS/CC approval.  This  does  not  prevent  Installation  Commanders/DFCs  from  using  their  own statistics  to  obtain  criminal  patterns  or  brief  personnel  on  criminal  activity  in  the  local area of their installation. Statistics will not be released for unit, numbered AF, regional, or  MAJCOM  comparisons.  While  local  commanders  may  desire  this  information  for comparison  purposes,  this  does  not  meet  the  System  Security  Access  Agreement‘s requirement for a valid  need to  know‖ in  order to release SFMIS information.  Improper release  of  information  without  a  valid  need-to-know  may  jeopardize  continued  SFS access to the SFMIS. 1.11.7.8.  Any release of information regarding the technical aspects of the system itself, not  data  contained  within,  must  be  coordinated  through  24  AF/CC.  Contact  HQ AFSFC/SFOP for additional guidance. If the government was involved in an incident or the  situation  might  result  in  litigation  against  the  government,  consult  the  Staff  Judge Advocate before the release of any information. (T-1) 1.11.8.  Violation  of  PII  Disclosure.    IAW  AFI  32-332,  The  Air  Force  Privacy  and  Civil Liberties  Program,  immediately  report  any  suspected  or  confirmed  breaches  of  PII  to  the United  States  Computer  Emergency  Readiness  Team  (USCERT)  within  one  hour  of  the discovery.  Also,  report  action  to  the  local  Privacy  Act  Monitor  or  Officer  and  provide  a preliminary report to the installation Privacy Manager. (T-0)   18  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 1.11.9.  FOIA Exemptions. The FOIA provides access to federal agency records (or parts of those  records)  except  those  protected  from  release  by  nine  specific  exemptions.  For  more information refer to http://www.foia.af.mil/handbook/. 1.11.10.  Deleting  Records.  The  Air  Force  Board  for  Correction  of  Military  Records  is  the authority  for  SFMIS  records  deletions.  Individuals  can  also  have  records  deleted  if  they receive a legal order of expungement of records pertaining to a specific case(s). (T-1) AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   19  Chapter 2 DEFENSE BIOMETRICS IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (DBIDS) 2.1.  Background.  DBIDS  is  a  DoD-owned  and  operated  system  developed  by  the  Defense Manpower  Data  Center  (DMDC)  as  an  identity  management  program  for  personnel  access  at DoD  installations.  It  is  a  networked  client/server  database  system  designed  to  electronically verify the access authorization of personnel entering military installations by the use of barcode contact  and  contactless  reader.  The  program  supports  the  adding,  retrieving,  updating  and displaying  of  information  for  individuals  who  require  military  installation  access.  The  DBIDS software  application  is  used  to  enter  personnel  information  into  a  database,  capture  biometric information and retrieve that data and biometric information for verification and validation at a later time. DBIDS enhances the military Integrated Defense (ID) mission by helping to provide a safe  and secure  community. DBIDS  is  the  Air  Force Physical  Access  Control System (PACS).  NOTE:  Installation  Access  Control  System  (IACS)  is  a  version  of  DBIDS  and  is  known  as IACS in USAFE. 2.1.1.  Installation  entry  control  information  is  contained  in  AFI  31-113,  Installation Perimeter Access Control. 2.1.2.  The  system  works  in  the  Online  (connected  to  LAN)  and  Offline  (not  connected  to LAN) modes. 2.1.3.  The offline function is utilized when the server connection is down and access to the database  through  a  local  workstation  is  required.  The  offline  function  works  from information  stored  in  the  hard  drive  of  the  respective  workstation  or  Access  Control  Point (ACP). Newly added information  on vehicles or personnel  registered in  DBIDS  will not  be available until the workstation can synchronize the data for that local file. 2.1.4.

Receive  immediate  notification  when  a  barred  individual  attempts  to  enter  the installation. 2.4.7.  Support  Force Protection Condition  (FPCON) measures related to installation access control. 2.5.  System Operation. 2.5.1.  Installations with DBIDS must utilize the system IAW AF 31-113. (T-2) 2.5.2.  Traffic lanes at the installation gates will be equipped with DBIDS scanners. (T-2) 2.5.3.  Visitor  Control  Centers  should  be  equipped  with  DBIDS  desktop  computers  to facilitate issuing visitor passes and generate daily reports (if required). 2.5.4.  Base Defense Operations Centers (BDOC) may have DBIDS computers and personnel with law enforcement officer (LEO) access. This facilitates the ability of BDOC personnel to find  information  on  those  individuals  in  DBIDS.  There  are  also  unique  functions  the  LEO role can perform. Specifics on these functions can be found in the DBIDS manual. 2.5.5.  ID  cards  will  be  scanned  by  using  a  handheld  device.  An  audible  beep  and  a  green light will verify the ID card has been scanned properly. If the handheld will not scan the ID cards, scan them with the pistol scanner attached to the gate system. The purpose is to verify if there is a problem with the ID cards. If problem continues, conduct a manual lookup on the computer desktop. Instruct the person to report to the Visitor Control Center (VCC) to assist in resolving any problems. 2.5.5.1.  The  scanner  will  positively  identify  an  individual  and  return  an  access recommendation (green, yellow or red). 2.5.5.2.  If  a  green  screen  appears,  physically  verify  the  individual’s  picture  and information on the ID card against the display and person presenting the ID.   24  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 2.5.5.3.  If the information matches, allow entry. If it does not match, deny entry and send for secondary screening. BDOC will be contacted immediately if the secondary screening does not match. 2.5.5.4.  If  a  yellow  screen  appears,  it  can  indicate,  but  is  not  limited  to,  any  of  the following:    debarred  at  another  installation,  driving  status  suspended,  Red  Cross notifications or pending DEERS verification. Check Status box on handheld scanner for information. 2.5.5.5.  If a red screen appears, follow the displayed instructions. Red notifications will normally consist of: wants and warrants, Be On The Look Out (BOLO), barred, call law enforcement,  expired  ID,  terminated  ID,  lost  or  stolen,  unrecognized  credential, unauthorized  credential,  not  authorized  at  this  time/day/gate,  etc.  Check  Status  box  on handheld  scanner  for  information.  Access  Point  Operators  must  pay  attention  to  the notifications  which  will clearly  detail  the  reason  for  a  red  screen.  Use  of  Force  may  be required with certain notifications. 2.5.5.6.  Yellow  and  red  notifications  will  require  action.  Units  should  develop procedures for handling these notifications. 2.5.6.  If the individual is not  registered in  DEERS, the individual will be required to  go to the  installation’s  designated  visitor  center  and  produce  two  forms  of  identification. Installations will determine the age required for children to receive a DBIDS credential and if they  have  to  be  registered  in  the  system.  Circumstances  for  how  this  is  applied  will  be developed locally. 2.5.7.  In the event of a lost or forgotten identification card, personnel can gain access to the installation  with  a  sponsor  or  issuance  of  a  pass  after  authentication  of  fingerprints  or  the card can be brought to the member prior to being allowed entry. 2.5.8.  Individuals must be registered in DBIDS at an installation in order to facilitate access.  DBIDS v.4.0. will automatically register personnel with CAC or Teslin ID cards when the ID is scanned with the handheld scanner at the ACP, or the ID may be manually registered at the VCC.  Non  DoD  PIV  cardholders,  FNs,  DBIDS  cardholder  and  visitors  must  be  manually registered in DBIDS. 2.5.9.  Actions for System  Failure. Any technology can fail for a number of reasons.  In  the event the DBIDS system is off line and credentials cannot be produced, the AF Form 75 and SFMIS will be used to allow access IAW AFI 31-113. AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   25  Chapter 3 NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM (NLETS)/NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC) AND ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS 3.1.  Program Definition.  National Law Enforcement Terminal System (NLETS) and National Crime  Information  Center  (NCIC)  are  access  systems  to  civilian  law  enforcement  data.  These systems  allow  the  prompt  exchange  of  law  enforcement  information  between  Security  Forces and  other  law  enforcement  officials.  NLETS/NCIC  terminals  are  required  for  identity verification  prior locations  for NLETS/NCIC to support DBIDS operations are the Visitor Control Centers, 24 hour SF Facility (BDOC)  to  conduct  name  checks  after  the  Visitor  Center  closes  and  the  Commercial  Vehicle Inspection  (CVI)  station.  As  indicated  below,  the  DFC  will  determine  the  number/location  of NLETS/NCIC terminals needed to accomplish identity verification. issuance  of  visitor  passes/DBIDS  Cards.  Potential to 3.2.  Program  Responsibilities.  The  following  agencies  and  personnel  are  responsible  for various aspects of the NLETS/NCIC program: 3.2.1.  HQ  AFOSI  is  the  US  Air  Force  executive  agency  for  National  Crime  Information Center (NCIC) matters. 3.2.2.  MAJCOMs ensure US Air Force installations in the same state share systems and fund system acquisition, installation and support. 3.2.3.  The DFC establishes the need for an NLETS/NCIC terminal(s) and before acquiring and installing s/he must: (T-0) 3.2.3.1.  Contact MAJCOM/A7S to identify/obtain the FBI assigned ORI for the SF unit.

Restrict  access  to  data  as  “OFFICIAL  USE  ONLY  Law Enforcement  Sensitive”.  Users  and  serviced  agencies  follow  the  state  and  NCIC  guidance  on policies,  procedures,  formats  and  codes  required  for  entering  records  into  the  system.  Users  of the system can include but are not limited to SF members, Department of the Air Force (DAF) Civilian Police and DAF Security Guards requiring an official need for the information. (T-0) 3.4.  Criminal  History  Data.  Computerized  Criminal  History  (CCH)  and  the  NCIC  Interstate Identification Index (III) are federal systems of records and are controlled under the Privacy Act of  1974.  Grant  access  to  this  data  for  valid  law  enforcement  purposes  on  a  case-by-case  basis. There  must  be  a  DFC  level  approval  process  involved  with  access.  Units  will  determine  the process and codify it in local instructions. (T-0) 3.4.1.  Requests from  outside  the SF unit, with  the exception of AFOSI,  must be in  writing        and include the reason for the request to be approved by the DFC. Disclose data according to         AFI 33-332 and Chapter 2. (T-0) 3.4.1.1.  NCIC name checks are authorized for all visitors entering the installation.  Refer to AFI 31-113 for more information. 3.4.1.2.  Positive “Hit” for Code 4/Wants and Warrants: (T-0) 3.4.1.2.1.  The  operator  of  the  system  must  ensure  privacy  is  adhered  to  at  all  time and all radios  are secured and away from the subject  before any information can be transmitted across the net. 3.4.1.2.2.  Any  agency  that  receives  a  record  in  response  to  an  NCIC  inquiry  must confirm  the  “hit”  on  the  record.  Hit  confirmation  must  be  made  prior  to  taking  any action based upon the hit, such as arresting the wanted person, detaining the missing person,  or  seizing  the  stolen  property.  Once  the  Security  Forces  Controller  receives the initial notification of a hit, he will then direct the patrolman to “secure their mics”. This  warning  will  advise  the  patrolman  to  turn  their  radio  down  and  of  possible danger/criminal history of their subject. Also, this will ensure the radio transmission is  not  overheard  by  the  vehicle  occupants  and  alerting  them  of  a  possible  warrant situation.  While  receiving  the  information,  the  patrolman  will  take  appropriate measures to  get  behind  the vehicle for an additional layer of cover. Simultaneously, the SF Controller will direct another patrol to respond Code 2 to assist the patrolman on scene. Once an additional patrolman is on scene, they will take appropriate actions to detain the subject unit the situation is resolved. AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   27  3.4.1.2.3.  Confirming  a  hit  means  to  contact  the  agency  that  entered  the  record  to: ensure that the person or property inquired upon is identical to the person or property identified in the record. 3.4.1.2.4.  Ensure  that  the  warrant,  missing  person  report,  or  theft  report  is  still outstanding.  Obtain  information  regarding:  (1)  the  extradition  of  a  wanted  person when applicable, (2) the return of a missing person to the appropriate authorities, (3) the return of stolen property to its rightful owner, or (4) the terms and conditions of a protection order. 3.4.1.2.5.  NLETS  is  the  recommended  network  for  Hit  confirmation.  Even  if  the initial  confirmation telephone,  NLETS  should  be  used  for documentation. NLETS has created inquiry (YQ) and response (YR) formats for Hit confirmation. The (YQ) must contain one of the following priorities: is  handled  via 3.4.1.2.5.1.  Priority  1/Urgent  -  confirm  the  hit  within  10  minutes.  This  priority should be used in  those instances where the Hit  is  the only basis for detaining a suspect or the nature of a case requires urgent confirmation of a hit. 3.4.1.2.5.2.  Priority 2/Routine  - confirm  the hit  within  1 hour. This  priority will be used when the person is being held on local charges or when property has been located  under  circumstances  where  immediate  action  is  not  necessary.  NOTE: After  confirming the hit  with  the entering  agency and upon taking  a person into custody or acquiring property, the recovering agency must place a “locate” on the corresponding  NCIC  record.  This  will  indicate  to  initiating  law  enforcement agency the subject or property location. 3.4.2.  Although  this  is  not  a  background  check,  it  will  provide  feedback  on  whether  the person  is  wanted  by  any  federal  agency,  to  include  the  national  Terrorist  Screening  Center (TSC) IAW AFI 31-113. A positive hit, via the TSC, will provide the following information in most circumstances:  (T-0) 3.4.2.1.  Handling Code 1: Table 3.1.

Do  not  enter Subject’s  name  and  identifiers  into  a  blotter  entry  or  into  SFMIS.  AFOSI  investigates terrorism cases jointly with the FBI and is  the primary liaison  agency  for the Air Force with  the  FBI  and  other  federal  agencies.  FBI  investigative  data  will  not  be  entered  into other data bases (SFMIS) or permanent documents (SF Blotters) due to discovery actions that  could  impact  the  investigations.  Additional  agreements  must  be  in  place  to  define   30  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 how  these  scenarios  will  be  handled  after  notification  of  AFOSI  and  subsequently  the FBI. 3.4.2.5.  TSC information and local policy must be included in annual training and Duty Position    Evaluations  (DPE)  for  all  positions  which  may  receive  TSC  notifications  via NCIC or through notification. This  will include the following positions: Desk Sergeant, Flight Sergeant, Visitor Control Center, Installation Entry Controller and others. (T-0) 3.4.3.  Prohibit obtaining the CCH or NCIC III data from other sources except as authorized by the installation DFC. (T-3) 3.4.4.  Keep all requests for CCH or NCIC III check data from outside the SF unit on file for validation  purposes.  If  validation  records  do  not  correspond  with  access-approval  files, conduct an inquiry to resolve the difference. (T-3) 3.5.  Validation System and Records Maintenance.  Validate all entries into NCIC III or State Terminal System (STS). The FBI or STS sends records that require validation to the DFC. The DFC establishes a validation system that includes: 3.5.1.  Security  Forces  Desk  Blotter  (AF  Form  53)  entry  or  an  Incident  Report  (AF  Form 3545A) containing complaints where the offense occurred. This serves as source documents for entries. 3.5.2.  Use a folder for NLETS or NCIC-directed validation documents to maintain a list of all system entries. 3.5.3.  The  Defense  Force  Commander  must  select  a  terminal  agency  coordinator  (TAC)  to supervise, train with and control terminal operations. The TAC uses available documentation to validate entries into the system. (T-3) 3.6.  Agencies  Receiving  NLETS/NCIC  Service.  Agencies  will  adhere  to  the  written requirements and responsibilities provided by the terminal-owning agency. Written requirements include  training,  physical  protection  and  validations.  Units  with  NLETS  service  will  appoint  a primary  and  alternate  system  administrator.  Administrators  should  be  appointed  in  the  section which oversees routine use of the system, generally the S3 section. (T-0) 3.7.  Additional SF Systems. 3.7.1.  ForcePRO is a software application and the only authorized automated tool to conduct the  Integrated  Defense  Risk  Management  Process  (IDRMP).  ForcePRO  was  developed  to relieve the risk analyst of a large number of hand calculations while considering the risks to assets numbering in the tens to hundreds (specifically an entire AF base). ForcePRO is an AF certified  Decision  Support  Tool  authorized  to  be  installed  on  AF  computer  systems connected to the AF Global Information Grid (GIG). Once data is input into ForcePRO, the information  contained  within  becomes  classified  and  must  be  safeguarded.  For  more information on ForcePRO and the IDRMP, refer to AFI 31-101. 3.7.2.  The Security  Forces SMARTNet  is  a conceptual approach to  the future management of  Security  Forces  web-based  computer  applications.  In  the  past,  applications  were developed  either  by  the  unit,  the  Major  Command  or  the  Headquarters  Air  Force  Security Forces  Center  when  units  established  and  validated  new  requirements.  The  programs  were normally  contracted  as  stand-alone  applications.  This  resulted  in  a  multitude  of  programs with unfamiliar user interfaces, disparate databases and no common code base. AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   31  3.7.2.1.  SMARTNet is intended to consolidate programs to the greatest extent possible to maximize efficiency and reduce resource allocation. Where possible, technicians will re-write  programs  to  a  common  programming  language  and  use  a  mutual  database  on  a supported platform. This will ensure efficiencies are realized in re-utilization of common application code, reduce manpower by utilizing shared programming skill sets, condense cost  as  a  result  of  corporate  software  procurement  and  increase  security  for  critical  law enforcement personally identifying information (PII) data. Additionally, by streamlining the DoD certification and accreditation process and simplifying the migration to evolving technologies, applications can become more robust and released back to the user sooner. 3.7.2.2.  Where  possible,  merging  programs  onto  common  hardware  platforms  will reduce hardware costs (servers, switches, UPS, etc.), decrease manpower costs for system administration,  lower  server  hosting  costs  and  increase  stability  while  guaranteeing increased  uptime.  This  will  aid  in  future  technological  advancements  of  the  Security Forces  career  field  by  allowing  the  deployment  of  automated  products,  reducing  the training time to learn new programs and more efficient use of valuable resources. 3.7.3.  The Working Dog Management System (WDMS) is a software program developed for the  DoD  Military  Working  Dog  (MWD)  Program  and  is  utilized  by  the  341  TRS,  Military Veterinary Services, US  Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and US  Army MWD management offices.  WDMS provides full lifecycle management of the identity, medical status, training, operational  assignment  and  disposition  of  military  working  dogs  that  have  been  evaluated, acquired and deployed by the DoD and other Federal agencies participating in the program. The system now maintains over 10,000 dog records and other supporting records. 3.7.3.1.  To reach the worldwide customer base, the system is web based operating on a framework permitting worldwide access via the Internet and local area networks (LANs) using Secured Socket Layer (SSL) and encryption technologies. Data entry, reporting and ad-hoc querying can be performed. The application is composed of autonomous modules operating  off  a  common  database.  Each  module  facilitates  a  business  function  that generates or uses information significant to the lifecycle management of a working dog. This  system  is  managed  by  the  DoD  MWD  Program  Manager  at  HQ  AFSFC  and  is accessible via SMARTNet.   32  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 Chapter 4 SECURITY FORCES FORMS 4.1.

The  BDOC/Emergency  Control  Center (ECC)  controller  prepares  this  form  as  the  official  chronological  record  of  Security  Forces activities.  Installations  with  more  than  one  BDOC/ECC,  must  complete  separate  blotters. Completed  AF  Forms  53  should  include  sufficient  information  to  identify  persons  concerned, time of incident, facts and circumstances of incidents, and provide a complete summary of events for the duty shift of each flight. The form will be initiated at the beginning and terminated at the closing  of  each  duty  shift.  Blotters  must  be  signed  by  the  on-duty  flight  sergeant  to  certify  the form is official. Ensure required information is included on the reverse side of the original copy. Units  may  create  alternate  Microsoft  Word  versions  of  the  AF  Form  53.  Local  generated products  must comply with AF RDS  and PII  rules and regulations. AF Forms 53 often contain sensitive investigative or Privacy Act information and must be controlled. 4.2.1.  Blotters  may  be  kept  electronically.  If  filed  electronically,  MAJCOMs/local installations  will  develop  a  system  to  ensure  the  blotters  are  being  reviewed  by  the  Flight Leader/Flight Sergeant. 4.2.2.  Prepare sufficient copies to satisfy local requirements; however, distribution must be limited to only those personnel who have a valid daily requirement to monitor it, such as the Wing  Commander,  the  local  AFOSI  detachment  and  the  SJA  or  as  determined  by  the Installation Commander. At no time should the blotter be distributed below group level. Unit first sergeants and commanders receive notifications involving personnel within their unit. If the  Installation  Commander  decides  to  add  agencies  or  positions  to  the  distribution  list  not listed  here,  it  must  be  done  in  writing.  The  additional  distribution  list  will  be  reviewed annually to ensure it is relevant. 4.3.  AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass.  The AF Form 75 is an alternate means for controlling entry on and off AF installations if DBIDS or SFMIS are unavailable. This form is available on the e-publications website.

Sufficient copies should be prepared to satisfy local requirements. 4.6.  AF Form 1176, Authority to Search and Seize.  A search is an examination of a person, property or premises to uncover evidence of a crime or to uncover evidence of a criminal intent, such as stolen goods, burglary tools, weapons or other evidence. A seizure is the taking of such AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   33  items by authorities for evidence at a courts-martial or trial. Use the AF Form 1176 to ensure the search  and  seizure  is  legal  and  any  evidence  found  is  admissible  at  a  courts-martial  and Magistrate  Court.  This  form  is  prepared  for  the  signature  of  the  commander  having  search authority  over  a  specific  area,  property  or  person  to  be  searched.  The  commander  may  give verbal authority to search only after a probable cause briefing to him/her is accomplished and the situation  warrants  immediate  search.  The  commander  must  sign  the  AF  Form  1176  as  soon  as possible after oral authorization. Once the form is signed, Security Forces will retain and place it into  the  case  file.  NOTE:  Authority  to  Search  and  Seize  is  only  valid  for  3  days;  if  sufficient evidence  is  not  collected  within  the  3-day  time  frame,  a  new  1176  needs  to  be  accomplished. Copies are made and forwarded based upon local requirements. A search authorization is not a search warrant. Search warrants are an authority to search issued by civilian authorities only. 4.7.  AF  Form  1199  Series  of  Restricted  Area  Badges.  The USAF Restricted Area Badge is issued to  each person who is  granted unescorted entry authority for  restricted areas. The  forms are  serial  numbered  as  well  as  accountable  and  supplies  must  be  kept  secured.  The  forms  are self-explanatory and normally issued by the Pass and Registration Section.

Use  this  form  as  a  cumulative  traffic  record  (driving history)  for  drivers  who  are  principals  in  motor  vehicle  traffic  accidents  or  moving  traffic violations IAW AFMAN 31-116, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision Program. 4.9.  AF  Form  1315,  Accident  Report.  This  form  is  used  to  record  investigations  of  major traffic  accidents.  The  investigation  of  major  accidents  should  be  accomplished  by  a  trained accident investigator. Refer to AFMAN 31-116. 4.10.  AF  Form  1361,  Pick-Up/Restriction  Order.  This  form  is  used  to  record  facts  and provide  Security  Forces  with  information  about  pick-up  or  restrictions  on  members  of  the military services. The BDOC/ECC controller is responsible for completing the form. Filling out the  form  is  self-explanatory.  In  the  remarks  section,  include  a  brief  statement  as  to  why  the individual is restricted or required to be picked up. 4.11.  AF Form 1364, Consent for Search and Seizure.  This form is used when an individual voluntarily  consents  to  a  search  of  their  person,  area  under  their  control  or  their  personal possessions. Probable cause is not needed to ask a person for consent to search. Use this form to obtain  the  consent  in  writing.  Also,  ensure  the  suspect  and  witnesses  to  the  consent  sign  the appropriate  blocks  on  the  form.  Ensure  the  person  giving  consent  reads  and  fully  understands that anything  found in  the search  can be used  against them in  a criminal  trial, other judicial or administrative  proceedings.  Inform  the  individual  that  if  they  do  not  consent  to  a  search,  the Security Forces member cannot conduct a search without consent, authorization, warrant or other authorization recognized by law. Prepare this form only in one copy and then retain it with the case file. 4.11.1.  If  during  the  search  the  individual  withdraws  their  consent,  terminate  the  search immediately.  Ensure  all  pertinent  information  (time  consent  withdrawn,  time  search terminated and actions taken) are documented in the AF Form 3545, Incident Report. 4.12.  AF  Form  2586,  Unescorted  Entry  Authorization  Certificate.  This  form  is  used  to document,  coordinate,  and  approve  unescorted  entry  authority.  NOTE:  The  IDP  will  list  the units responsible for initiating the AF Form 2586.   34  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 4.13.  AF Form 3226, Authority to Apprehend in Private Dwelling.  Rule for Courts-Martial (RCM) 302 (e) of the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), requires written authority be obtained prior to  apprehending  a  person in  a private dwelling. This  form is  used to document receipt of this authority. 4.14.  AF  Form  3545  and  AF  Form  3545(A),  Incident  Report.  The  AF  Form  3545  and 3545(A)  were  created  to  meet  the  requirements  of  NIBRS/DIBRS  reporting  as  detailed  in Chapter  1.  Use  this  form  to  record  facts  about  an  incident  or  complaint  for  the  proper  military authority. Include in the report all available facts, names of personnel involved and a summary of the initial on-scene investigation. 4.14.1.  Use  the  AF  Form  3545  as  the  official  Incident  Report  at  sites  where  SFMIS  is  not available. In this case, each offender/victim/witness will require a separate information page. For example, there may be three offenders; each will require his/her own information page. At  sites  with  SFMIS  access,  use  the  AF  Form  3545  as  a  worksheet  to  gather  all  necessary information for future input into SFMIS and for creating the AF Form 3545(A). 4.15.  AF  Form  3907,  Security  Forces  Field  Interview  Data.  This  form  is  used  to  record routine contact between Security Forces members and members of the public IAW. For example, if a suspicious person was observed walking around the housing area in the middle of the night, this form would be used to record the contact made with the individual. The form is completed in one  copy  and  is  forwarded  to  the  Security  Forces  Investigations  Section.  The  Investigations Section can then compare this form with reported crimes in the area to develop possible leads or suspects. The form is self-explanatory. 4.15.1.  Units  will  develop  guidance  and  procedures  for  the  disposition  of  AF  Forms  3907.  (T-3) 4.16.  AF  Form  4443,  Law  Enforcement  and  Physical  Security  Activities  Report (LEPSAR).  This  form  is  used  to  query  statistics  on  all  criminal  activity  and  assist  installation commanders to reduce crime. 4.17.  DD Form 460, Provisional Pass.  This form is issued by a Security Forces member to an enlisted member of the Armed Forces. Information required by the form is self-explanatory. The DD Form 460 is issued when: 4.17.1.  The member is apprehended for a minor violation which does not require detention, but  which  may  result  in  a  delay  preventing  them  from  reporting  to  their  assigned  duty section/ installation within the time limit indicated on their orders or pass. 4.17.2.  The member's previous pass has expired or he/she is without a pass or leave orders, but is en route to his/her destination as evidenced by a valid transportation ticket. 4.17.3.  The member can present evidence they reported or attempted to report his/her delay to his/her commander. 4.17.4.  Because  of  extenuating  circumstances,  the  member  missed  their  transportation,  are delayed  through  no  fault  of  their  own  and  they  voluntarily  report  their  status  to  proper authority. 4.17.5.  It  is  necessary  to  order  an  individual  to  return  to  their  home  station  after apprehension for Absent Without Leave (AWOL). AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   35  4.18.  DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket.  This form is issued to an individual who has  committed  a  moving  or  non-moving  traffic  offense.  It  is  prepared  in  three  copies.  The original (white) copy is submitted through channels to the violator’s commander or if the violator is a military family member, to the sponsor’s commander. If the violator is a civilian employee, the white copy is sent to the individual’s commander. The ticket is sent to commanders for action to  be  taken  against  the  violator.  Unit  Commanders  or  Section  Commanders  are  the  only personnel  allowed  to  sign  the  Command  Action  area  of  the  DD  Form  1408,  Armed  Forces Traffic Ticket. Ensure this form is entirely completed. 4.18.1.  The second (yellow) copy is used by Security Forces to record pertinent information. It  can record details  about  the instructions issued to  the violator, names of witnesses to  the offense and vehicle defects. Tracking history for stationary and moving RADAR can also be detailed.  Use  this  information  later  to  refresh  the  patrol  person’s  memory  if  the  ticket  is contested. The yellow copy is then filed in the S5R section. 4.18.2.  The third copy (pink) is given to the violator or affixed to the vehicle if the vehicle is unattended. Do not  complete blocks 2-7 if ticket is  left  on an unattended vehicle. This  will ensure personal information is protected. The patrolman will still need to complete blocks 2-7  on  the  (white/yellow)  copies  for  administration  purposes.  Complete  the  back  of  the  pink copy  before  giving  it  to  the  violator.  This  gives  the  violator  written  reporting  instructions. This must be done even if the violator has been given verbal instructions. Normally, the back of the pink copy is completed before the back of the yellow copy. This prevents the violator from being detained for an unnecessary amount of time. 4.18.3.  File the second (yellow) copy and give the third (pink) copy to the violator or place it on the windshield of the unattended vehicle. If there is inclement weather, place the ticket in a plastic bag. 4.18.4.  The  reverse  side  of  the  DD  Form  1408  is  used  for  transmittal  of  traffic  violations through  military  channels.  Ensure  the  violation  indicated  on  the  DD  Form  1408  is    IAW AFMAN 31-116 and all required information is carefully entered on the form. 4.18.5.  Ensure the required information is annotated. If the ticket has administrative errors, it will  be  returned  to  S3  for  correction.  If  the  ticket  needs  to  be  voided,  the  issuing  Security Forces member or DFC may do so. No other person has the authority to void a ticket. 4.19.  DD  Form  1920,  Alcohol  Influence  Report.  This  form  is  used  to  record  field  sobriety tests  and  observations  made  of  individuals  suspected  of  being  involved  in  any  incident  where alcohol or drugs may be a factor. The apprehending Security Forces member will complete the form  and  it  will  become  a  record  of  their  observations  for  future  reference.  Record  all observations made, including those not required by the DD Form 1920. 4.20.  DD  Form  2701,  Initial  Information  for  Victims  and  Witnesses  of  Crime.  This  form should  be  available  and  is  issued  to  all  personnel  when  criminal  conduct  adversely  affects victims or when witnesses provide information regarding criminal activity. If in doubt, issue the form.  The  form  gives  the  individual  information  on  the  Victim/Witness  Assistance  Program (VWAP) and is self-explanatory. Information needed to complete the form can be obtained from the base legal office or the S2I. When the form is issued, it must be documented on AF Form 53 and AF  Form  3545. Further information  on the  DD Form  2701 and the  VWAP  is  contained in AFI 31-118, Security Forces Standards and Procedures.   36  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 4.21.  DD  Form  2708,  Receipt  for  Inmate  or  Detained  Person.  This  form  is  used  when Security Forces personnel are releasing an individual they have detained or apprehended. It can also  be  used  to  transfer  prisoners  between  confinement  facilities.  The  form  is  self-explanatory and  should  be  prepared  in  two  copies.  The  original  form  is  maintained  with  the  case  file  as  a source  document  indicating  an  official  transfer  of  the  individual  and  the  copy  is  given  to  the individual who received the subject. 4.22.  United States District Court Violation Notice (USDCVN).  This form is used when it is determined  an  offender  will  be  prosecuted  for  a  minor  offense  before  a  US  Magistrate  under   AFI 51-905, Use of US Magistrates for Trial of Misdemeanors Committed by Civilians. Active Duty Air Force personnel will not be issued a USDCVN. Security Forces, Department of the Air Force civilian guard/police or game wardens who are authorized to make an apprehension, arrest or to issue a violation notice  or ticket,  will issue this form. Before it is distributed, the specific address of the Clerk of the United States Court (Central Violations Bureau) to which the violator must address  his/her communication will be stamped (or typed) in  black ink,  on the  reverse of the violator's copy (manila card stock) of the four-part form. The USDCVN is accountable once it is issued to the violator. 4.22.1.  When  completing  the  USDCVN,  Security  Forces  personnel  must  take  great  care  to assure  each  entry  is  legible  and  no  entry  is  smudged  on  the  chemically  carbonized  paper copies . NOTE: Required information for the violation notice may vary from installation to installation. Consult with the local SJA for further processing requirements. 4.22.2.  USDCVN Copy, Reverse: This  is the area used for the probable cause statement, if necessary. The probable cause statement is a very important item on the USDCVN. Contact local SJA for guidance on completing this section. 4.22.3.  After the notice is issued, the following disposition is mandatory: 4.22.3.1.  The original copy (white) will be forwarded by the issuing Security Forces unit (SFAR/S-5R) to SJA who will then forward to the Central Violations Bureau. 4.22.3.2.  The  officer’s  copy  (pink)  will  be  forwarded  to  the  Security  Forces  unit (SFAR/S-5R) to maintain in SFS records. 4.22.3.3.  The defendant copy (yellow) and envelope is given to the violator, or if it is a parking  violation,  placed  on  the  vehicle.  The  reverse  includes  instructions  for  the violator. 4.22.3.4.  If  a  violation  notice  has  been  issued  in  error,  it  may  only  be  voided  for  two reasons.  The  DFC  is  responsible  to  the  United  State  Magistrate's  Court  and  only  voids violation  notices  in  cases  of  mistaken  identity  of  person  or  obvious  legal  error.  If  the agency is still in possession of all copies, the violation notice will be voided by the DFC. This  ensures  the  integrity  of  the  ticket  issuing  process.  All  spoiled  tickets  will  be disposed of according to the guidelines furnished by the court. 4.22.3.5.  Ensure  all  required  information  is  annotated.  If  the  violation  notice  has administrative errors, it will be returned to S3. If the ticket needs to be voided, the DFC must do so. AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   37  4.22.3.6.  If  the  violation  notice  has  already  been  placed  on  a  vehicle,  given  to  the defendant, or has been forwarded to the CVB, the notice can only be dismissed by the US magistrate judge for that district. 4.22.3.7.  A written statement signed by the DFC from the agency requesting a violation notice(s)  dismissal  or  void  must  be  forwarded  to  the  CVB  via  mail  or  e-mailed  to  the following address: cvb@cvb.uscourts.gov. (FD-249)/Criminal  Fingerprint  Card.  DoDI  5505.11, 4.23.  Federal  Document-249 Fingerprint  Card and Final  Disposition Report Submission Requirements, requires an FD-249, Criminal Fingerprint Card, be submitted on all subjects under investigation by SF for offenses listed in Attachment  8 of the DoDI. For additional requirements and procedures for use of the Criminal Fingerprint Card, refer to AFI 31-118, Chapter 9. 4.24.  R-84/Final Disposition Report.  The R-84 must be prepared on each subject who has had an FD-249 submitted to the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division without final disposition noted. If the final disposition is not available, complete the left side and forward the  form  when  the  case  is  referred  to  the  prosecutor  and/or  courts.  If  the  final  disposition  is known when the FD-249 is submitted, it should be noted on the FD-249 which in turn makes the R-84 unnecessary. The Agency that is ultimately making the final disposition will complete and mail the R-84 to: FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg WV 26306. 4.24.1.  SF  should  fill  in  all  arrest/apprehension  data  on  the  left  side  of  the  R-84  as  the contributor of fingerprints. SF will ensure their Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) is placed in the appropriate block. If the arrest/apprehension is disposed of by SF (e.g., the offender is released without charge), SF will complete the R-84 and mail the R-84 to CJIS at the address listed in  paragraph 4.20.1.  In the event  the  case  goes to  the prosecutor, the R-84 should be forwarded to the prosecutor with the offender’s case file. (T-0) 4.24.2.  The  prosecutor  will  complete  the  R-84  to  show  final  disposition  at  the  prosecution level is not being referred for court action and submit the R-84 to FBI/CJIS. If court action is required,  the  prosecutor  should  forward  the  R-84  with  the  case  file  to  the  court  having jurisdiction. (T-0) 4.24.3.  The  court  should  complete  the  R-84  as  to  final  court  disposition  such  as  when offender is acquitted, case is dismissed, conviction/sentence imposed or suspended, or person placed on probation. (T-0) 4.24.4.  Completing  the  form.  The  numbers  in  the  blocks  shown  on  the  front  and  reverse sides  of  the  Form  R-84  correspond  to  the  following  paragraphs  describing  the  information you should enter into the blocks. FBI/CJIS has released several versions of the Form R-84 of which all are accepted. For the purposes of this instruction, the 2007 version was used. 4.25.  US  Army  Criminal  Investigation  Laboratory  (USACIL)  DNA  Database  Collection Card.  The  collection  card  is  contained  in  the  collection  kits  provided  by  USACIL,  as  well  as detailed instructions on how the kit is to be handled. All blocks on the card are to be completed in their entirety.  After completion of the card, ensure the Gold Notification Card enclosed in the kit is distributed to the offender.   38  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 Chapter 5 SECURITY FORCES ADMINISTRATION AND REPORTS 5.1.  Security Forces Processing DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket. 5.1.1.  If the violator does not notify S5R within 5 duty days of request to rebut the citation, S5R will complete the administrative process by writing on the back of the white copy ‘did not rebut’ and endorse the infractions on the DD Form 1408. However, S5R must still notify the  violator’s  first  sergeant  and  commander  of  the  violation.  If  the  violator  is  assigned  to another  installation,  forward  the  citation  to  the  assigned  installation  for  action.  It  is  the responsibility  of  the  installation  to  which  the  member  is  assigned  to  input  the  citation  and complete the administrative action in SFMIS. (T-3) 5.1.1.1.  Notification to the violator’s first sergeant and commander can be accomplished either via e-mail, base information transfer system (BITS) or official mail; however, the process must be standardized and provide accountability.  (T-3) 5.1.1.2.  If the violator does not  wish to rebut  the violation, S5R inputs the citation into SFMIS; S5R will then check the appropriate response on the back of the citation and the violator requires no further action. NOTE: Notify the installation commander or designee for  approval  to  revoke/suspend  driving  privileges  for  violators  who  have  accumulated enough points. The violator’s first sergeant/commander will need to escort the member to S5R for issuance of revocation/suspension letter. 5.1.2.  If  an  individual  is  cited  for  a  serious  offense  such  as  drag  racing  on  the  installation, driving while under revocation, or speeding (Art 134, Reckless Endangerment), the DD Form 1408  will  be  processed  though  S5R  as  outlined  in  paragraph  5.5.,  Incident  Reports.  The nature of these incidents may generate a report. If so, process the report and ticket together. 5.2.  Security Forces Processing DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, rebuttals. 5.2.1.  If  the  violator  wishes  to  make  a  written  rebuttal,  the  violator  must  submit  a  rebuttal letter  articulating  his/her  position  to  the  DFC through  S5R  within  14-days  of  receipt  of  the ticket. The letter must be endorsed by his/her commander. The purpose of this endorsement is to ensure commander-level involvement. The commander must add comments supporting the violator’s guilt or innocence. 5.2.1.1.  S5R  will  obtain  a  written  statement  from  the  Security  Forces  patrolman  who issued the ticket for inclusion in the rebuttal package. 5.2.2.  S5R will log the DD Form 1408 into a local suspense tracking system and SFMIS and obtain the answers to the following questions to give to the rebuttal authority: 5.2.2.1.  Is the offense on the citation suspendable? 5.2.2.2.  If  the  rebuttal  authority  allows,  does  the  offender  wish  to  make  a  personal appearance or produce a written rebuttal? 5.2.2.3.  S5R places the yellow copy of the DD Form 1408 in the suspense file pending disposition. Set 14-day suspense for command action. AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   39  5.2.2.4.  Complete  blocks  19-23  on  the  back  of  the  white  copy  and  annotate  any  prior history, points assessed and the suspense date. In the Report of Action Taken on Traffic Violation,  black  out  the  words  ‘No  Action  Taken’;  this  is  not  an  option.  If  applicable, attach  the  driving  history  for  the  violator  from  SFMIS.  Forward  the  white  copy  to  the violator’s commander for action. If a DD Form 1408 was issued during the course of an accident investigation, attach a copy of the accident report to the ticket when it is sent for command action. 5.2.2.5.  If response on command action is not received by the due date, forward a Notice of  Late Suspense memorandum,  which  can be electronic, providing an additional 7-day suspense.  If  the  additional  suspense  is  not  met,  send  a  Notice  of  Second  Late  Suspense memorandum  to  the  unit  commander  with  a  courtesy  copy  to  the  group  commander. Suspense  extensions  will  be  granted  by  DFCs  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Notices  of  Late Suspense  can  be  completed  electronically  as  long  as  S5R  maintains  a  copy  of  the  read receipt. 5.2.2.6.  The  completed  package  will  be  forwarded  to  the  DFC  for  his/her  annotation/ recommendation  and  subsequently  to  the  rebuttal  authority  (wing  commander  or designee)  for  final  decision.  Once  the  rebuttal  authority  has  made  a  decision,  S5R  will notify the violator of the final outcome of his/her ticket rebuttal in writing. 5.2.2.7.  Once  finalized,  record  command  action  and  enter  it  into  the  SFMIS  case database. 5.3.  United States District Court Violation Notice. 5.3.1.  Log  the  USDCVN  into  SFMIS.  For  units  without  SFMIS  access,  log  the  USDCVN into  the  local  tracking  system  in  S5R  and  create  a  file  for  the  violator’s  records.  Each violation requires a different USDCVN. 5.3.2.  For  hard  copy  files,  file  the  pink  copy  in  the  suspense  file  pending  disposition.  S5R will mail the white copy to the CVB at the local Magistrate's location, unless another process has been determined by the local SJA office. 5.3.3.  The CVB will set a Magistrate Court Docket list and forward it to S5R. 5.3.4.  Using  the  CVB  Docket  list,  pull  the  white  and  pink  copies  for  Magistrate  Court  as indicated by the local staff judge advocate. 5.3.5.  After the Magistrate’s action, enter the actions taken in the SFMIS database. 5.3.6.  Procedures for Rebutting the USDCVN: 5.3.6.1.  Violators who  receive a USDCVN may  rebut  the ticket  through  the Magistrate Court System on the date scheduled by the CVB. The violator may call the Magistrate for additional  information  regarding  the  status  of  their  ticket.  Staff  Judge  Advocate  (SJA) and S5R representatives, along with the court clerk, will take into account all information presented by the violator and determine if the ticket  merits dismissal.  SJA has the final word  on  whether  or  not  to  dismiss  the  ticket.  S5R  personnel  serve  primarily  in  an advisory and administrative capacity. 5.3.6.2.  If the violator still wishes to rebut the USDCVN and requests a hearing with the federal magistrate, S5R will obtain a court schedule through SJA and notify the Security   40  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 Forces  patrolman  who  issued  the  citation  of  their  scheduled  appearance.  The  federal magistrate will make the final determination as to guilt or innocence. 5.3.6.3.  CVB  provides  S5R  with  a  list  of  the  status  of  all  processed  tickets.  S5R crosschecks this list with SFMIS and local ticket tracker (SFMIS applicable). 5.3.7.  When  your  existing  stock  of  violation  notices  is  depleted,  request  form  via  the following  website:  http://www.cvb.uscourts.gov/vn.  Enter  the  login  name  of  “AGENCY” with a password of “TICKETS.” 5.3.7.1.  Choose the option “Request Violation Notices.” 5.3.7.2.  To submit a request, complete the form and click the button at the bottom of the page. 5.3.7.3.  A valid CVB location code is required to order violation notices. 5.3.7.4.  The  CVB  will  send  the  books  directly  to  the  law  enforcement  agencies  in  the field. 5.4.  Processing Incident Reports. 5.4.1.  Review reports for accuracy and required information. If a report is incomplete, return it to the appropriate office with a suspense for returning the corrected report. 5.4.2.  Ensure when Security Forces patrolmen enter a report into the SFMIS database that all appropriate  fields  are  filled  in  without  NIBRS/DIBRS  errors.  If  a  Report  of  Investigation (ROI) is  completed by Security Forces  Investigations,  regardless  if it is  the initial  report or follow-up  report,  ensure  the  entire  ROI  is  entered  into  SFMIS  (to  include  the  synopsis, interviews, etc.). 5.4.3.  Establish a 60-day suspense for reports requiring commander action and place them in a suspense file. Annotate the suspense date on the cover letter of the report. If prior histories exist,  print  and  attach  the  history  to  the  report  for  the  commander’s  information.  (NOTE: Prior histories are normally provided only for suspects/subjects of the report.) If response on command  action  is  not  received  by  the  due  date,  forward  a  Notice  of  Late  Suspense memorandum  establishing  an  additional  14-day  suspense.  If  the  additional  suspense  is  not met, forward a Second Notice of Late Suspense memorandum to the unit commander with a courtesy copy to the group commander. The DFC will only extend suspense dates on a case-by-case  basis.  Notices  of  Late  Suspense  can  be  completed  electronically  as  long  as  S5R maintains a copy of the read receipt. 5.4.3.1.  Incident reports require command action. They must be signed by the subject’s unit/squadron  commander.  First  sergeants  or  other  personnel  may  complete  the administrative  process  of  the  report;  however,  the  report  must  be  signed  by  the unit/squadron commander. 5.4.3.2.  An e-mail with  the Common Access  Card (CAC)  enabled digital  signature  can satisfy the commander’s signature for closeout of the incident. 5.4.4.  For reports on civilians not affiliated with the base or retired military and their family members over the age of 18, forward the report and the USDCVN(s) to the US Magistrate or local  District  Attorney  for  consideration  of  prosecution.  If  the  case  involves  military  type crimes  such  as  driving  in  a  restricted  area,  missing  ID  cards,  etc.,  forward  to  the  base AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   41  commander  or  designee  for  disposition.  If  the  report  is  on  a  juvenile,  local  procedures  will identify the action authority. 5.4.5.  For  incidents  involving  members  from  other  DoD  components,  the  initial  incident report  will  be  logged  into  the  SFMIS  database.  Forward  an  action  copy  to  the  individual’s installation  provost marshal/master at  arms/military  police unit. Annotate  forwarding of the report in the narrative portion. 5.4.6.  For incident reports involving Air Force personnel away from their home station, log the report into the SFMIS database and forward an action copy to the member’s home station DFC  for  processing.  The  individual’s  home  station  S5R  will  track  the  incident  for  final disposition/ commander’s action through the SFMIS database using the  existing record and case  number  entered  by  the  base  where  the  incident  occurred.  Do  not  generate  a  new  case. Use the existing case previously entered into SFMIS. 5.4.7.  Information Only reports are reports with no subject. Annotate the “Action Required” in the SFMIS database with “Information Only.” Provide a copy of the report to appropriate commanders upon request or per local policy. 5.4.8.  Reports sent for additional investigation: 5.4.8.1.  If a report needs additional investigation by Security Forces Investigations (S2I), forward  a  copy  of  the  AF  Form  3545A,  Incident  Report,  and  all  attachments  (if  not received from SFMIS) to S2I. 5.4.8.2.  If  a  report  is  investigated  by  the  Air  Force  Office  of  Special  Investigations (AFOSI), a copy of the report with a Request for Investigation/Declination cover letter is sent  with  a  21-day  suspense.  The  letter  must  be  returned  with  OSI’s  Special  Agent  in Charge  or  designee  written  acceptance/declination.  SFMIS  will  be  updated  to  show  the transfer. (T-2) 5.4.8.3.  Reports are not releasable until the final investigation is completed IAW AFI 33-332  and  DoDR  5400.7,  Freedom  of  Information  Act.  Upon  completion  of  the investigation, reports may be released to the SJA, as necessary. Unit commanders receive either an action or information copy of the report. 5.4.9.  Reports Not Returned by the Suspense Date: 5.4.9.1.  If  response  is  not  received  by  the  due  date,  contact  the  investigating  agency  to see  if  the  investigation  is  ongoing.  Keep  the  DFC  advised  as  to  why  the  report  has  not met the suspense and have the DFC determine what  action should be taken. Extensions may be granted on a case-by-case basis. 5.4.9.2.  Keep all correspondence or make a memo concerning any communication about a case and file with the report. 5.5.  Forwarding of Driving/Criminal Records/Suspension, Revocation and Debarment. 5.5.1.  Upon  receipt  of  PCS  orders  or  notification  via  Virtual  Military  Personnel  Flight (VMPF), conduct a SFMIS check. The SFMIS feature for the forwarding of records will be utilized for PCS moves. 5.5.2.  If the violator is pending commander action for a citation or criminal activity, attempt to place the violator on administrative hold until the action has been completed. If a member   42  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 refuses to give S5R any needed information, inform them they cannot be out-processed until it is provided. 5.5.3.  The Commander Support Staff (CSS) must be listed on the Security Forces Squadron out-processing  checklist  for  both  PCS  and  TDY.  Review  the  latest  admin  hold  list  prior  to clearing a member. If there are any questions about whether or not a member can be released, consult SJA. 5.6.  Preparation  of  DUI/DWI,  No  Proof  of  Insurance  or  Revocation/Suspension  of  Base Driving Privileges Packages. 5.6.1.  Prepare  a  folder  (this  can  be  electronic  or  hard  copy)  on  the  individual  with  the following paperwork: 5.6.1.1.  Request for legal review/coordination. 5.6.1.2.  Copy  of  the  preliminary  or  driving  revocation  letter  (pre-signed  by  the  wing commander  or  his/her  designee  and  normally  issued  by  the  apprehending/detaining Security Forces patrolman). 5.6.1.3.  Copy  of  the  DUI/DWI,  no  insurance,  driving  while  license  suspended/revoked report or ticket (to include any command action already taken). 5.6.1.4.  Any blood test drug/alcohol results (if available/applicable). 5.6.2.  Input  revocations  and  suspensions  information  into  the  SFMIS  database  and  follow routing procedures. The installation commander or designee is the final  action authority for these packages. 5.6.3.  Installation commanders may honor suspensions from other installations on a case-by-case basis per AFI 31-218(I), Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision. 5.6.4.  If  a  certified  suspension/revocation  letter  is  returned  as  undeliverable,  ensure  S5R retains the original with the case file and forwards a copy to the S3. If contact is made with the subject on base, Security Forces will issue the letter and forward the signed letter to S5R for attachment to the case file. 5.6.4.1.  If  a  military  member’s  driving  privileges  are  suspended/revoked,  then  his/her unit commander or designee must be notified. 5.6.4.2.  Overseas locations will develop procedures IAW host nation agreements. 5.6.5.  Update  the  suspension/revocation/debarment  listing  as  soon  as  the  installation commander or designee signs the package. 5.6.6.  Once  the  letter  is  returned  with  the  appropriate  signature,  inform  the  individual’s commander. The individual and their supervisor must report to S5R where the individual will sign  the  final  revocation  letter.  If  the  person  is  not  military  affiliated,  send  the  letter  by certified mail to the violator’s listed address. If overseas, local procedures will be developed to meet notification needs. 5.6.7.  If  a  rebuttal  is  requested,  provide  the  individual  with  instructions  to  submit  their rebuttal  letter  through  S5R  to  the  installation  commander  (or  designee)  for  driving revocations and the installation commander only for debarments. AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   43  5.7.  Notifying State Licensing Offices.  Notify state licensing agencies (state offense occurred in and the issuing state of driver’s license), by mail, of all DUI/DWI cases as well as revocations of base driving privileges or refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test. A sample memo is located in Attachment 3. Telephone numbers for state agencies are located in  Attachment 4. Many of these state licensing offices addresses can be found online. 5.8.  Debarment  Authority.  Under  the  authority  of  50  U.S.C.  §  797  and  DoDD  5200.8, Security  of  DoD  Installations  and  Resources,  installation  commanders  may  deny  access  to  the installation  through  the  use  of  a  debarment  order/letter.  Installation  commanders  may  not delegate this authority. (T-0) 5.8.1.  Debarment  Orders.  Debarment  orders  will  be  coordinated through  SJA. Documentation  supporting  debarment  must  be  kept  for  the  period  of  the  debarment. Debarment  orders should be in  writing and contain  sufficient  details  to  support prosecution by civilian authorities. The debarment order must also state a specific, reasonable period for the  debarment.  Oral  debarment  orders  should  be  given  only  when  time  constraints  prevent preparing  a  written  order  (letter),  or  the  severity  of  the  incident  warrants  immediate debarment.  In  all  cases,  debarment  must  be  immediately  followed-up  in  writing.  SFMIS contains debarment information. An example is available in Attachment 5. 5.8.1.1.  If practical, debarment letters will be hand-delivered. 5.8.1.2.  If  hand  delivery  is  impracticable,  debarment  letters  should  be  sent  via  certified mail to ensure a record of receipt. 5.8.1.3.  Debarment  information  will  be  placed  into  SFMIS.  S5R  will  ensure  the  Site Security  Manager  (SSM)  at  their  location  is  forwarded  the  most  current  Debarment information. This will be done every time an individual is debarred. The information will be placed in DBIDS. 5.8.2.  Installation commanders may honor debarments from other installations on a case-by-case  basis  per  Title  18  United  States  Code  Section  1382.  For  further  information  on Debarments, refer to AFI 31-113. 5.9.  Preparation of Revocation of Exchange/Commissary Privileges Packages. 5.9.1.  Review  report  and  ensure  an  on-scene  revocation  of  AAFES/Commissary  Privileges Letter was issued. This letter is locally generated. 5.9.2.  Prepare  the  final  AAFES/Commissary  Revocation  Letter  and  a  copy  of  the  case  for local  SJA  and  installation  commander  or  designee  for  signature.  This  process  can  be modified through local procedures approved by installation commander or designee and SJA. Ensure the case is updated in SFMIS accordingly. (T-3) 5.9.3.  Once  the  letter  is  returned  with  the  appropriate  signature,  inform  the  individual’s commander.  For  military  members  and  federal  civilian  employees  on  the  installation,  S5R issues the final revocation letter in person, with the individual’s supervisor/sponsor present. If the person is not military affiliated, send the letter by certified mail to the violator’s listed address. If overseas, local procedures will be developed to meet notification needs. 5.9.4.  If using a pre-signed letter, it should be issued by the patrolman while on scene after coordination with installation commander or designee and SJA.   44  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 5.10.  Certified Mail Procedures. 5.10.1.  Use  the  S5R  certified  mail  log  to  document  certified  mail.  Annotate  the  number below the last line of the return address on the envelope. Also, put the number on the front, lower  left  hand  corner  of  the  Postal  Service  (PS)  Form  3811,  Domestic  Return  Receipt.  If authorized, mailer may use a privately printed Form 3800, Certified Mail Receipt, or obtain a certified  mail  PS  Form  3800,  Certified  Mail  Receipt,  and  affix  it  to  the  middle,  upper  and front  portions  of  the  envelope.  All  forms  should  be  typed.  For  more  information  refer  to USPS S912.2.4 located at www.usps.com. 5.10.2.  Prepare a Postal Service (PS) Form 3811. Annotate in section 4a the article number (the same control number listed on the PS Form 3800). In section 4b, check the box for the correspondence being sent (certified). On the bottom of the PS Form 3811, indicate the case number  and/or  type  of  incident  case  to  which  the  PS  Form  3811  pertains  (i.e.,  I-00-02-050/Driving Revocation). 5.10.3.  Type  an  AF  Form  12,  Accountable  Container  Receipt.  In  the  “TO”  block,  type information  in  all  capital  letters:  UNIT  DESIGNATION,  PHYSICAL  ADDRESS,  AIR FORCE BASE, STATE AND ZIP CODE. NOTE: Each envelope counts as a separate item number. Under the container number, write the S5R  log number in numerical  order.  Under reference,  write  in  all  capital  letters,  CERTIFIED/RETURN  RECEIPT  REQUESTED  for each entry. After the last entry, type dashes and the words ///LAST ITEM///. Finish the line with more dashes to the end of the row. 5.10.4.  Wrap the AF Form 12 around the envelopes, which must be in numerical order, and secure  them  with  a  rubber  band.  When  BITS  picks  up  the  mail,  they  will  acknowledge receipt of the forms and leave the top copy of the AF Form 12 in the case folder. 5.10.5.  The  Postal  Service  will  return  the  signed  PS  Form  3811  to  S5R  upon  addressee acknowledgment. If the PS Form 3811 is returned undeliverable and is a debarment package, forward the original letters to the S3 and file the envelope along with any other receipts in the case folder. All other incidents are filed directly in the case folder. 5.11.  Preparing Packages for Filing. 5.11.1.  Once a package has been coordinated, a file folder or electronic files will be prepared with  a  copy  of  the  report  and  signed  package.  Prepare  the  label  and  ensure  it  specifies  the deletion date for the file. As a reminder, you must follow all appropriate steps before the file can  be  closed  (i.e.,  driver  safety  course,  notification  to  state  licensing  agencies,  etc.).  The case is then filed accordingly. 5.11.2.  AFOSI  is  the  agency  responsible  for  putting  data  into  the  Defense  Clearance Investigations Index (DCII).  Security Forces will provide original reports of investigations, AF Forms 3545A, Incident Reports, and USDCVN to  AFOSI. S5R  will maintain copies of these reports IAW disposition of records requirements. 5.12.  Requests for Information.  Requests for reports will be processed IAW AFI 33-332; DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN  33-302,  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  Program;  thru  the  S5R  office only  or  FOIA  office  (follow  instructions  in  paragraph  1.12.).  The  routine  uses  for  Security Forces  incident  reports,  including  traffic  violation  reports,  are  listed  in  the  applicable  Security Forces (SORN)located Records Notice System of AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   45  at:http://dpclo.defense.gov/Privacy/DODComponentArticleList/tabid/6799/Category/277/department-of-the-air-force.aspx.  All  information  released  will  be  marked  “For  Official  Use Only”; it is the releasers duty to ensure documents are marked correctly. 5.13.  Conducting Local Records Checks.  Law enforcement/official government agencies may request  local  record  checks.  These  requests  will  be  written,  e-mailed,  faxed  (on  official letterhead) or delivered in person with  proper identification from  requester. Criminal  checks as part  of  a  law  enforcement  investigation  require  no  prior  consent  from  the  person(s)  being checked.  Only  local  base  records  checks  can  be  conducted  by  S5R.  Using  the  NCIC  for employment  background  checks  is  not  authorized  IAW  federal  law,  28  U.S.C.  §  534,  and  as discussed  in  the  National  Law  Enforcement  Telecommunications  Systems  Handbook,  dated        1 Jan 99. 5.14.  Tracking Reports and Statistics.  AF Forms 53, Security Forces Blotter, are received by S5R via e-mail, on a unit server, and/or hard copy. S5R maintains all AF Forms 53 IAW AFI 33-364,  Records  Disposition  Procedures  and  Responsibilities.  Ensure  all  AF  Forms  3545A,  DD Forms  1408,  USDCVNs  and  AF  Forms  1315,  Major  Accident  Report,  are  completed  and/or issued  into  SFMIS  or  arrange  for  the  responding  patrolmen  to  input  information  into  SFMIS. Identify all trackable incidents in the blotter and enter them into SFMIS according to category, (e.g.,  Larcenies,  Accidents,  DUIs,  Suicide  Attempts,  Damage  to  Property)  and  for  statistical crime data information reporting. 5.15.  Management and Disposition of Security Forces Files. 5.15.1.  Security  Forces  files  will  consist  of  reports,  tickets,  forms,  patrolman  notes,  etc.  NOTE:  The  installation  may  choose  to  use  an  electronic  file  plan.  If  used,  paper  records should  not  be  destroyed  until  they  are  no  longer  needed  for  revision,  dissemination,  or reference, whichever is later IAW AF RDS, Table Notes 212-214. 5.15.2.  Records will be recorded and maintained  IAW AF RDS, Table 31-01: Security Law Enforcement Records, Table 31-102: Security Correction Records and table 31-13: Security Incident-Based reporting. 5.15.3.  All information containing Privacy Act data or sensitive information will be properly disposed  of  as  required  by  AFI  33-364  and  AFI  33-332,  will  be  maintained  IAW  AFMAN 33-363 and will be disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). 5.16.  Disposition of Files from Active to Inactive and Staging. 5.16.1.  Disposition of SFAR/S5R records is governed by AFI 33-364 and AFMAN 33-363.      AF Forms 53 are destroyed (by shredding) at the end of the retention period. 5.17.  Disposition of Debarment, AAFES & Driving Revocation Packages. 5.17.1.

Driving  Revocations  are  removed  at  the  end  of  their  timeframe  and  put  in  the inactive  file  to  be  maintained    IAW  AFMAN  33-363  and  disposed  of    IAW  the  Air  Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).   46  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 5.18.  Sex Offenders. 5.18.1.  The  AF  does  not  have  a  sex  offender  registry.  Sex  offenders  living  on-base  must register  IAW  the  state  in  which  they  reside.  Enforcement  of  state  laws  on  military installations  depends  upon  the  jurisdiction  of  the  installation  (i.e.,  exclusive  federal, concurrent  or  proprietary).  The  real  estate  division  of  the  Civil  Engineer  Squadron  (CES) maintains records that document type of jurisdiction. In the event that jurisdiction is not clear despite  CES  records,  installations  will  work  with  the  local  SJA  to  determine  privatized housing jurisdiction. If the base has no jurisdiction, the state or county must enforce the state sex offender laws at these locations. If the on-base housing unit sits on land that is subject to exclusive or concurrent federal jurisdiction, the installation commander can enforce the state sex offender registration laws. Keep in mind that sex offender laws, such as when to register and how far the registered offender must live from a school, vary from state to state. 5.18.2.  Nothing  herein  prevents  the  installation  commander  from  debarring  a  sex  offender from  base.  Such  decisions  must  maintain  good  order  and  discipline  and  advance  the  health and welfare of the base populace, and not be arbitrary and capricious. AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   47  Chapter 6 LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION EXCHANGE (LINX) AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE LAW ENFORCEMENT DEFENSE DATA EXCHANGE (D-DEX)  6.1.  History.  LInX was developed by NCIS in 2002 and achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in 2003. The concept was to provide automated and rapid sharing of law enforcement data that  was  already  in  the  Records  Management  Systems  (RMS)  of  the  various  law  enforcement agencies in regions of the country of particular interest to the Department of the Navy and NCIS.  The  primary  purposes  of  the  system  include:  rapid  identification  of  suspects,  resolution  of suspicious  incidents,  lead  generation  to  solve  crimes  and  prevent  terrorism,  “connecting  the dots”,  and  “giving  context  to  the  dots”.    The  system  now  consists  of  10  geographical  regions listed below. 6.1.1.  Building on the success of the LInX system, NCIS Executive Leadership determined it would be beneficial to the Department of Navy (DoN) and the Department of Defense (DoD) to develop and implement a companion system identified as the Department of Defense Law Enforcement Defense Data Exchange (D-DEx). The D-DEx system capitalizes on the LInX technology and is similar in its operation.  The D-DEx system is currently operational and is connected to all 10 LInX geographical regions as well as the National Law Enforcement Data Exchange  (N-DEx).  Once  full  implementation  is  completed,  D-DEx  will  contain  data  from the  Department  of  Defense  law  enforcement  agencies.  The  D-DEx  system  may  contain certain  information  which  participating  DoD  agencies  elect  not  to  share  outside  the  DOD. Therefore, as described in Section 3 below, it is NCIS policy that NCIS users will only have D-DEx  accounts,  which  permits  access  to  both  the  D-DEx  and  LInX  systems.  D-DEx  is  a replication of an agency’s data stored on a separate and secure D-DEx server. 6.2.  Partner Systems.  LInX and D-DEx cooperate with other information sharing entities such as  the  National  Law  Enforcement  Data  Exchange  (N-DEx)  administered  by  the  Department  of Justice and various private and regional systems.  In D-DEx, N-DEx can be queried from within the system by selecting the appropriate “neighborhood(s)” or it can be accessed directly through an N-DEx portal in D-DEx. Searching such partner systems is encouraged as they cover parts of the USA that are not in the LInX Regions. Users should realize that displays of data from other systems may have different data sets available and they may display differently than data from LInX agencies. 6.2.1.  Information  Sharing  Memorandums  of  Agreement  (MOA)/Understating  With Jurisdictions  Not  Participating  or  Covered  by  CJI  Sharing  Through  N-DEx.    To  ensure against  information  sharing  gaps  in  N-DEx,  Defense  Force  Commanders  (DFC)  are authorized  and  encouraged  to  seek  MOA/MOU  CJI  sharing  agreements  with  allied  and partner  agencies  (i.e.  State/local  LE/Police  Departments  (PD)  not  tied  into  N-DEx.    These MOA/MOUs  should  contain  clearly  established  standard  operating  procedures  regarding scope and timeliness on how and what information will be shared. (T-3) 6.3.  Access to Information Sharing Systems. 6.3.1.  Access to D-DEx. As previously mentioned, Security Forces users will obtain D-DEx accounts  to  achieve  maximum  benefit  from  the  systems.  D-DEx  users  have  full  access  to LInX information and therefore do not require LInX accounts. AFSFC and MAJCOMs will   48  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 have a     D-DEx System Administrator assigned and that person should be contacted for new accounts and training. 6.3.1.1.  Initial training and an agreement to use the system only for lawful purposes are required before accessing the system. All personnel will be required to fill out a DD Form 2875  and  complete  current  training  for  PII.  There  are  various  features  allowing  for automated  system  administration,  self-service  password  help  and  additional  video training  modules.  D-DEx  is  currently  Common  Access  Card  (CAC)  enabled  and  will eventually be CAC enforced. Certain types of DoD users may have access limited to their need to know as listed below. (T-0) 6.3.1.1.1.  Tactical  User  -  Able  to  query  “pointer”  data  only  (Title,  CCN  and Agency/POC). 6.3.1.1.2.  Analytical User - Able to query full reports. Envisioned for Special Agents, Criminal Analysts, Dispatchers and Police Watch Commanders. 6.3.1.1.3.  Systems  Administrator  -  Able  to  create  accounts,  disable  accounts  and block reports. 6.3.1.2.  All  prospective  D-DEx  users  are  required  to  complete  a  basic  training  course prior to accessing the data in the system. (T-0) 6.4.  Training  and  Certifications.  All  prospective  D-DEx  users  are  required  to  complete  a basic  training  course  prior  to  accessing  data  in  the  system.  Normally,  D-DEx  System Administrators are responsible for providing this training although they may also  certify others as D-DEx Trainers who have completed the required training and exhibit the ability to train on the  system.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  AFSFC  and  MAJCOMs  to  assist  the  System Administrators  by  providing  logistical  support  such  as  arranging  training  spaces  and  managing participation. (T-0) 6.4.1.  D-DEx users are  encouraged to  periodically  review the on-line training modules and “New Features” descriptions available from the D-DEx homepage located on SMARTNet. 6.5.  Expectation  of  Use.  It  is  NCIS  policy  that  D-DEx  is  expected  to  be  used  to  thoroughly research relevant  information on all NCIS investigations and operations regardless  of category. The best practice is for the D-DEx inquiry to be conducted by the case agent, who by definition is  most  familiar  with  the  case  and  therefore  most  likely  to  identify  pertinent  results.    It  is  also permissible for D-DEx inquiries to be conducted by support personnel, assigned analysts and on urgent  cases  when  normal  D-DEx  access  is  not  available,  by  watch  standers  in  the  NCISHQ MTAC.  In addition to the initial D-DEx inquiry normally conducted at the time the investigation is  opened,  periodic  D-DEx  inquiries  should  be  conducted  during  the  pendency  of  the  case  as additional information is developed.  Remember, in addition to investigative support, D-DEx is a primary tool for safety. Security Forces users are encouraged to use the “watch list” function in D-DEx on active subjects so that the investigators will be alerted if the subject has a new contact with  law  enforcement.  This  function  is  managed  under  the  “My  D-DEx”  section  of  the  home page. 6.6.  Validation.  Data derived from D-DEx/LInX may be used for the primary purposes of rapid identification of suspects, resolution of suspicious incidents and lead generation to solve crimes without  further  authorization.  The  use  of  NCIS  data  in  D-DEx  by  Security  Forces  users  is AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   49  permissible  in  all  ways  that  the  same  information  is  used  now  without  further  authorization. However, all D-DEx information derived from other agencies, including any analytical products derived from it, may not be used as a basis for action nor be disseminated outside of the D-DEx program  for  any  purpose  or  in  any  other  manner,  unless  the  person  making  the  inquiry  first obtains  the  express  permission  of  the  agency  or  agencies  that  contributed  the  information  in question. Included within the prohibition are any specific inclusion of D-DEx/LInX information in an official case file, and any use of such information in the preparation of judicial process such as  affidavits,  warrants  or  subpoenas  without  prior  permission  of  the  contributing  agency.  Normally, the person making the D-DEx inquiry will simply contact the contributing agency to determine if the information is current, correct and complete and to request a copy of their report for  inclusion  in  the  case  file.  The  various  Memoranda  of  Understanding  governing  D-DEx  do allow for immediate use of some information under conditions of extreme danger, but follow-up with the originating agency must be made as soon as possible. 6.7.  Justification.  All  D-DEx  users  are  required  to  provide  a  reason  for  the  inquiry  in  the “justification” block of the search page. In many cases, the case control number (CCN) may be used;  however,  a  CCN  is  not  necessary  and  it  is  adequate  to  include  sufficient  information  to remind the user why he/she made the inquiry if questioned in the future such as during the audit process.  Such  reasons  as  “investigation”  are  not  specific  enough  to  meet  the  justification requirement.  Some  examples  of  proper  justifications  are:  “ID  possible  theft  suspect”,  “locate witness”, “Get XYZ PD report number” and “verify suspect’s address”.  “Testing”, “Training”, and  “Demonstration”  are  also  valid  justifications  for  those  functions.  Users  are  generally cautioned against running themselves or acquaintances to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety. 6.8.  Background  Investigations.  D-DEx/LInX  policy  prohibits  the  use  of  these  systems  for employment  background  investigations  with  the  exception  of  backgrounds  conducted  on prospective employees of one’s own agency. In other words, D-DEx inquiries can be run during investigations on Security Forces employees or prospective employees. It  generally may not be run  for  other  purposes  such  as  general  licensing,  eligibility  for  federal  or  state  benefits  or background investigations for other agencies. This prohibition does not apply to background type inquiries  conducted  as  part  of  any  criminal  or  CI/CT  investigation.    If  unique  circumstances exist, contact a D-DEx Division Representative for additional information. 6.9.  Reporting  Results.  When  D-DEx/LInX/N-DEx  information  is  summarized  or  otherwise documented,  the  user  shall  indicate  that  the  information  was  obtained  from  the  contributing agency  and  not  D-DEx/LInX/N-DEx.  A  user  may  put  very  general  comments  on  D-DEx/ LInX/N-DEx  in  Security  Forces’  reports.  For  example,  a  Security  Forces  ROI  (OPEN)  may contain  this  or  similar  language:  “Reporting  Investigator  queried  the  D-DEx/LInX/N-DEx systems, which showed that Subject was identified as being a victim of a burglary investigated by XYZ Police Department in 2006 under report #123456. LInX records also indicated Subject was  arrested  for  DUI  by  XYY  PD  in  2007  under  citation  #34567  and  FBI  #XX34561.    The official  records  of  these  incidents  will  be  requested  from  XYZ  and  XYY  Police  Departments.  No  official  action  will  be  taken  without  the  official  documents  or  communications  with  the originating  agency”.    The  actual  reports  of  the  burglary  and  DUI  should  be  sought  from  the police department, if relevant, and permission should be requested to include the actual report or a summary of it per current policy. (T-0)   50  AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015 6.10.  Printing.  The decision to  temporarily print  inquiry results in  the  LInX program  is  made by  the  regional  Board  of  Governance  or  N-DEX.  These  governing  bodies  generally  permit  the temporary printing and retention of the copy for a period not to exceed 72 hours. These regional LInX rules are incorporated in the LInX operating system, which prevents printing if printing is not  authorized  from  a  particular  region  represented  in  the  result  set.  Each  printed  document contains a caveat  showing who printed the material  and when it must be destroyed. Within  the D-DEx program, temporary printing of any information has been authorized following the same 72-hour  retention  period.  Printed  D-DEx/LInX  results  are  not  to  be  filed  in  case  files.  System Administrators will monitor compliance through the case review and audit processes. 6.11.  Use  of  Photographs.  Most LInX regions and D-DEx permit the printing of photographs (mug  shots)  obtained  from  the  system.  The  retention  of  these  photographs  follows  the  same      72-hour restriction unless they are used in a photographic line-up.  In that case, the contributing agency should be contacted to validate the photograph and the photograph handled as per current policy. 6.12.  Sanctions.  Unauthorized use, which includes requests, dissemination, sharing, copying or receipt of D-DEx/LInX information, could result in civil proceedings against the USAF Security Forces  and/or  criminal  proceedings  against  any  user  or  other  person  involved.  All  violations should be reported to the NCIS LInX/D-DEx Division. (T-0) 6.12.1.  Audits of Security Forces use of the D-DEx system will be conducted at least once per year. These audits consist of a sampling of the users and of particular individual users as warranted.  The  system  allows  for  precise  auditing  by  username,  date  and  time.  NOTE:  Administrators should audit 25% of their personnel quarterly. This process will make it easier for annual audits. Questionable transactions will be researched and provided to the appropriate  oversight  entity  only  when  necessary.  It  is  the  intent  of  the  audit  to  maintain system integrity and not to discourage creative, appropriate uses of the system. Users will be presumed to be using the system for appropriate purposes and within the spirit of innovative police work and cooperation unless evidence suggests otherwise.  (T-0) 6.12.2.  Information  Sharing  Memorandums  of  Agreements/Understanding  (MOA/MOU) with  jurisdictions  not  participating  or  covered  by  CJIS  sharing  through  N-DEx.  To  ensure against  information  sharing  gaps  in  N-DEx,  Defense  Force  Commanders  (DFC)  are authorized and encouraged to seek MOA/MOU CJIS sharing agreements with state and local LE  Police  Departments  (PD)  not  tied  into  N-DEx.    These  MOA/MOUs  should  contain clearly established standard operating procedures regarding scope and timeliness on how and what information will be shared.  JUDITH A.

It has come to my attention that you [describe incident(s) in detail; for example, "were found in possession of marijuana at the on-base quarters of Staff Sergeant John Smith on 15 January 2008."].   2.  Based upon the above, I consider your continued presence on this installation to be detrimental to the maintenance of good order and discipline.  Effective immediately, you are ordered to not enter or reenter (installation name) for a period of (state the time frame).    3.  If you fail to comply with this order, you will be subject to prosecution under Title 18 United States Code §1382, which reads in part:    “Whoever reenters or is found within any installation, after having been removed there from or ordered not to reenter by any officer or person in command or charge therefore shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.”   4.  Should you reenter (installation name) in violation of this order, without having received prior approval, you will be subject to detention by the Security Forces for delivery to the appropriate civilian and military authorities.    5.  If you are entitled to medical treatment at (hospital name), you may enter (installation name) for the sole purpose of using said facility.  To do so, you must present this letter to the entry controller at the installation entry point and obtain the appropriate visitor pass.  You will travel directly to the medical facility by [describe precise route the individual must travel to go to and from the medical facility].  You may not deviate from this route nor stop for any reason on your way to or from the facility.    6.  Under extraordinary circumstances, requests for temporary access to other facilities on (installation name) may be granted.  Such requests should be made in advance and in writing through the Chief of Security Forces, and set out the reason(s) why access should be granted.  If time does not permit, such a request must be made to the Security Forces control center at (phone number).  The controller will then notify the appropriate officials and convey your request.    7.  This order will remain in effect [(indefinitely) or (for the period prescribed above)], unless otherwise modified or revoked in writing by myself.  If a compelling reason exists which you believe should be sufficient to justify modification or termination of this order, you may submit your justification to me, in writing, through the Chief of Security Forces.    AFI31-120  1 APRIL 2015   65    Installation Commander's Signature Block    cc:  SFS Reports and Analysis Branch    1st Ind, (name of first indorser)                                                                                                  MEMORANDUM FOR  (installation commander office symbol)   This is to certify that I, the undersigned, have received the forgoing order in writing and have read and fully understand the same.
