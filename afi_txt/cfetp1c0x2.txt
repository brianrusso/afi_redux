The CFETP is a comprehensive core-training document that identifies life-cycle training and education requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for every specialty.  The CFETP will provide Aviation Resource Management personnel a clear career path to success and instill sound objectivity in unit level training. 1.1.  Compliance with the provisions contained within this CFETP is mandatory. 1.2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how to use the plan.  Section B identifies career progression, duties, responsibilities, training strategies and career field path.  Section C associates each skill level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, training, education, and experience).  Section D indicates resource constraints i.e., funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.  NOTE:  See Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) for job descriptions. 2.2.  Part II includes:  Section A  Identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) training conducted, wartime course/core task and correspondence course requirements.  The STS is placed at the end of the CFETP because it requires a different page formatting, and so that it may be easily separated from the CFETP if required. Section B  Identifies the Initial and Advanced Skills Course objective list. Section C  Identifies available OJT support materials.  Qualification training packages identified in this section have been developed to support both upgrade and qualification training.  Section D  Contains the Training Course Index and identifies courses available for the specialty. Section E  Identifies MAJCOM Formal schools. 3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  1 CFETP 1C0X2 9 February 2017 ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED Advanced Training (AT).

Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for the AFCFM, MFMs, commanders, CHARM/FM, training managers, supervisors, trainers and trainees to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive and a qualification level to maintain in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3, 5, 7 and 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  It is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual career. 1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual's career. 1.2.1  When the proficiency codes are the same for 5-skill level and 7-skill level ICWs, the 7-skill level trainee will receive enhanced instruction. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process. 2.  Uses. The plan will be used by MFMs, CHARMs/FMs, 1C0X2 training program managers, and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for every individual in the specialty. 2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, qualification, and proficiency requirements.   2.3.  Each individual must complete the mandatory training requirements specified in AFI 11-421.  The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AETC training manager for this specialty will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  Use the list of courses in Part II to eliminate duplicate training.  5 CFETP 1C0X2 9 February 2017  SECTION B - CAREER PROGRESSION AND INFORMATION 4.  Specialty Descriptions.

This section identifies known resource constraints that preclude optimal/desired training from being developed or conducted, including information such as cost and manpower.  Explanations of each resource constraint and its impact on training are included.  Also included in this section are: actions required, office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates.  Resource constraints will be, as a minimum, reviewed and updated annually. 12.  Training Constraints.  None. SECTION E - TRANSITIONAL TRAINING GUIDE There are currently no transitional training requirements. This area is reserved.  PART II SECTION A - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD 1C0X2 1.  Implementation.  Implementation of this Specialty Training Standard (STS) for technical training provided by AETC is scheduled with the class entering 05 Jan 2017 and graduating 09 Feb 2017 for 3-skill level training.  2.  Purpose.  As prescribed, this STS:  2.1.  Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and Technical References (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. Number task statements sequentially i.e., 1.1, 1.2, and 2.1 Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements.  2.2.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  For OJT documentation and transcription procedures, see AFI 36-2201. Column E and F are proficiency codes for the ICW 5 and 7- skill level training requirements.  2.3.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task and knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.  2.4.  Qualitative Requirements.  The proficiency code key is used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and CDCs.  2.5.  Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the AETC Airman Advancement Division, by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in Chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, AF Military Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to the ANG.   3.  Recommendations.  Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of AETC training.

(Example:  b and 1b)  **  A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.  -  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.  X  This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.    NOTE:  All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time. 16         1.  Tasks, Knowledge And Technical References 2.  Core Tasks  3.  Certification For OJT 4.
