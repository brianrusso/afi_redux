Purpose. 1.1.1.  The  mission  of  the  Air  Force  Medical  Service  (AFMS)  is  to  ensure  medically  fit forces,  provide  expeditionary  medics,  and  improve  the  health  of  all  we  serve  to  meet  our nation’s needs.  To carry out this important mission, the AFMS must recruit and retain highly qualified medical assets.  Medical Special and Incentive (S&I) pay is one of the many tools designed  to  attract  and  retain  highly  skilled  health  professions  officers.    S&I  pay  is authorized  by  37  U.S.C.  Chapter  5;  Department  of  Defense  Instruction  (DoDI)  6000.13, Medical  Manpower  and  Personnel;  and  Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Health  Affairs (ASD(HA)) policy memorandums.  Statutory requirements for special pays are regulated by the Secretary of Defense and delegated to ASD(HA) for implementation.  The S&I budget is subject to re-authorization each fiscal year. 1.2.  Applicability. 1.2.1.  This instruction applies to Regular Air Force (RegAF) AFMS officers and mobilized Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve on Title 10 orders for other than training purposes for  at  least  one  year.    Failure  to  comply  with  the  policies  and  procedures  within  this  Air Force Instruction (AFI) may result in a member losing pay, delayed payment, or extension of active duty service commitment (ADSC). 1.3.  General Eligibility. 1.3.1.  While  basic  eligibility  based  on  licensure  remains  consistent,  criteria  is  subject  to change based on changes in legislation, budgetary restrictions, needs of the Air Force (AF), and  ASD(HA)  policies.    Each  fiscal  year  (FY),  the  AFMS  S&I  pay  plans  are  approved  for implementation  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for  Manpower  and  Readiness  (SAF/MR) and  published  by  the  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC),  Medical  Special  Pays  Branch (AFPC/DPANF1).  For details, refer to the current FY pay plans and contracts. 1.3.2.  To  be  eligible  for  S&I  Pay,  an  individual  must  be  an  officer  in  (or  in  the  case  of accession bonus (AB), agree to accept a commission into) the RegAF designated as a health professions officer (HPO), and 1.3.3.  Meet  retainability  requirements  to  complete  the  ADSC  incurred  upon  signing  and submitting  any  contract.    The  officer’s  signature  on  a  special  pay  contract  authorizes AFPC/DPANF1 to extend the officer’s ADSC provided it does not exceed a mandatory date of  separation  (DOS)  based  on  age,  commissioned  years  of  service,  or  other  force management tools. If an extension to the current DOS is required for the officer to serve the full ADSC incurred by the S&I pay contract, all changes must be made to the officer’s record before the contract is submitted to AFPC/DPANF1. 1.3.3.1.  Age.  Upon reaching age 61, officers who wish to remain RegAF beyond age 62, but not to exceed age 68, must obtain an approved age waiver and submit the waiver with the special pay contract.  Note:  Officers in the rank of lieutenant colonel and below may request  DOS  waivers  and  age  waivers  through  the  appropriate  assignments  office  at AFI41-109  14 JANUARY 2015   5  AFPC/DPAN.    DOS  changes  and  age  waivers  for  officers  in  the  rank  of  colonel  and above are managed by the AF Colonel Management Office (AF/DPO). 1.3.3.2.  Commissioned  Years  of  Service.    In  accordance  with  (IAW)  10  U.S.C.  §634, Retirement for years of service: regular colonels and Navy captains, §633, Retirement for years of service: regular lieutenant colonels and commanders, and AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements,  Table  4.1.,  officers  cannot  exceed  commissioned  years  of  service  limits unless approved for continuation by a selective continuation board.  Officers in the rank of lieutenant colonel  cannot  enter into a special pay agreement that results in  an ADSC that  surpasses  28  years  of  total  active  commissioned  service.    Officers  in  the  rank  of colonel cannot enter into a special pay agreement that results in an ADSC that surpasses 30 years of total active commissioned service. 1.3.4.  Be fully qualified in his/her specialty and not currently attending internship training or initial residency training except as specified in the current pay plan, 1.3.5.  For privileged HPOs:  meet requirements of licensure and/or certification and be able to  practice  independently  to  the  extent  authorized  in  AFI  44-119,  Medical  Quality Operations.  1.3.6.

Insufficient  retainability  to  enter  into  a  specified  time  period  contract.  Commanders  (authorized  endorsers)  may  initiate  a  recommendation  to  withhold  special pays  based  on  the  propensity  to  continue  serving  on  active  duty  and  continued retainability for entering into specified time period contracts.
