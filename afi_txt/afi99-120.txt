General. 1.1.  The Air Force has experienced a significant growth in the procurement and development of precision guided air-to-ground (A/G) and air-to-air (A/A) weapons.  The increased range, complexity  and  lethality  of  these  weapons  routinely  require  the  use  of  a  TIK  and/or  FTS during  developmental  and  operational  test  and  evaluation  as  well  as  testing  during sustainment  to  comply with  range safety policy  and procedures to  allow expenditure, along with the need to know what is happening to munitions during all phases of employment for fault analysis.  See paragraphs 2.1.1 and 2.2.1 for types of testing covered.  This instruction resolves the historical misconception that requesting and getting a munition asset, includes getting any required TIK or FTS; it does  NOT.  The actions to get a TIK/FTS are worked separately with the weapon program office. 1.2.  Successful  implementation  of  this  instruction  is  incumbent  upon  close  coordination between  the  Requirements  and  Acquisition  communities,  to  include  the  test  organizations and  parent  headquarters,  aircraft  and  weapon  program  managers,  and  applicable Headquarters Air Force  (HAF) offices in  identification of TIK and FTS requirements.  The significant costs of TIK and FTS necessitates that requirements are scrutinized and numbers validated at each level of review.  The validation of TIK and FTS asset requirements used in developmental  test  occurs  at  the  program  office  level,  while  operational  test  resources  are closely coordinated with the operational test agency/organization (OTA/OTO). 2.  Responsibilities. 2.1.  Program Managers (PM) (Aircraft and Weapon program offices) will: 2.1.1.  Develop  program  specific  TIK  and  FTS  requirements  through  coordination  with test  agencies  and  ranges  to  be  used.  (T-1)    These  requirements  include  TIK  and  FTS required  for  developmental  test  and  evaluation  (DT&E),  live  fire  test  and  evaluation (LFT&E),  lot  acceptance  test  (LAT),  qualification  test  and  evaluation  (QT&E),  first article test (FAT), regression  testing, Air  Force  Operational Test  and Evaluation  Center (AFOTEC)-led test from paragraph 2.3, and MAJCOM-led test in paragraph 2.2.1.  AFI99-120  18 SEPTEMBER 2017 3 2.1.2.  Ensure  POM  submittals  include  validated  requirements.  (T-1)    Non-DT&E  TIK and  FTS  requirements,  such  as  described  in  paragraph  2.2.1,  are  identified  separately from  DT&E  requirements  to  the  appropriate  agency  in  supporting  documentation.  (i.e., one line for DT&E TIK and FTS requirements and one line for non-DT&E TIK and FTS requirements). 2.1.3.  Ensure weapon program managers provide TIK and FTS cost data, as required. (T-1) 2.1.4.  Provide  TIK  and  FTS  based  on  actual  funding  allocated  for  TIK  and  FTS.    This includes support for TIK and FTS installation, checkout, post-mission data reduction, and other required TIK/FTS support. (T-1) 2.2.  The Lead/Using MAJCOM will: 2.2.1.  Direct subordinate test agencies to develop and submit TIK and FTS requirements to  the  appropriate  weapon  PM  for  inclusion  in  the  POM.    MAJCOM  requirements include  any  required  TIK  and  FTS  for  force  development  evaluation  (FDE),  tactics development  and  evaluation  (TD&E),  weapon  system  evaluation  program  (WSEP), production  acceptance  test  and  evaluation  (PAT&E)  and  other  rapid  acquisition programs.   AFOTEC  is  not  a subordinate test agency and submits their requirements to the appropriate PM, and copies the Lead/Using MAJCOM/agency as stated in paragraph 2.3. 2.2.2.  Validate  TIK  and  FTS  requirements  by  subordinate  test  organizations,  prior  to submittal to PM. 2.2.3.  Submit  TIK  and  FTS  requirements  to  PM  with  sufficient  lead-time  (normally  18 months  from  receipt  of  funding)  to  account  for  TIK  and  FTS  total  production  time  and incorporation  in  appropriate  POM  submittal,  and  advocate  support  for  TIK  and  FTS requirements in the POM.  Non-DT&E TIK and FTS requirements, such as described in paragraph  2.2.1,  are  identified  separately  from  DT&E  requirements  to  the  appropriate agency in supporting documentation (i.e., one line for DT&E TIK and FTS requirements and one line for non-DT&E TIK and FTS requirements). 2.3.  AFOTEC.  Provide  TIK  and  FTS  requirements  to  the  supporting  PM,  and  copies  the Lead/Using MAJCOM and Air Staff.  AFOTEC requirements include, but are not limited to, TIK  and  FTS  for  initial  operational  test  and  evaluation  (IOT&E),  qualification  operational test and evaluation (QOT&E), follow-on operational test and evaluation (FOT&E) and multi-service operational test and evaluation (MOT&E). 2.4.  AF/TEP.  Arbitrate (MAJCOMs)/AFOTEC in conjunction with AF/A5RW and SAF/AQPW. limited  TIK  and  FTS  resources  across  Major  Commands 3.  Programming and Funding Responsibilities. 3.1.  Through  IOC.  See  Table  1;  which  does  not  prevent  program  offices,  MAJCOMs  or AFOTEC  from  making  separate  temporary,  documented  funding  agreements  if  required.  Any  funding  agreement(s)  should  be  governed  by  the  principle  that  whoever  is  driving  the need  for  the  test  should  program  and  fund  TIK  and  FTS.    However,  in  the  absence  of  any documented agreement, use Table 1.  4 AFI99-120  18 SEPTEMBER 2017 3.2.  Upon distribution of annual FY budget, program managers will ascertain the quantity of TIK  and  FTS  that  can  be  procured  based  on  forecasted  requirements  and  actual  funding received. (T-1) 3.3.  Beyond IOC.  See Table 2. 3.3.1.  For  programs  that  require  aircraft-weapon  integration,  if  the  integration  test  is  a result  of  an  aircraft  change  or  upgrade,  the  aircraft  program  is  responsible  for programming  and  funding.    If  the  integration  test  is  the  result  of  a  weapon  change  or upgrade, the weapon program is responsible for programming and funding. 3.3.2.  As a life cycle system cost for sustainment weapons testing after weapon IOC, the weapons  PM,  through  Lead/Using  MAJCOM,  programs  and  funds  TIK  and  FTS  in support  of  WSEP  and  LAT.    Per  paragraph  3.3.1,  this  responsibility  falls  to  either  the weapon  PM  or  aircraft  PM  in  support  of  FDE  and  TD&E  dependent  upon  the  program driving the integration test need.

Unplanned Test Requirement Request. 4.1.  The  acquisition  of  a  TIK  or  FTS  normally  takes  a  minimum  of  18  months  from  the receipt of funding.  In parallel with the annual requirements process, test agencies coordinate their  TIK/FTS  requirements  directly  with  the  appropriate  weapon  PM,  to  include  any  out-year projections for major users, in  order to  avoid out-of-cycle requests (OOCR) inside the 18-month planning and execution cycle. (T-1)  Any agency requiring a TIK and/or FTS not previously identified or funded in the annual requirements process will submit a request for the assets through their MAJCOM to the weapon program office. (T-1)  The requesting unit needs to identify the munitions type, item required (TIK/FTS), quantity, test type, MAJCOM, test organization, test program, funding PE, justification/test reference specifics, and impact if not supported.  The agency request must be signed at the Group level (0-6 or equivalent),  6 AFI99-120  18 SEPTEMBER 2017 with  complete  justification  and  need  date.  (T-1)  The  MAJCOM  or  non-weapon  program office user validates the requirement and determines if it is a "must fill" requirement; if so, the  MAJCOM  or  non-weapon  program  office  makes  every  effort  to  source  required  assets from within assets already on hand supporting programs under its oversight using same.  If assets cannot be sourced from within, the non-weapon program elevates the request through channels to the Lead MAJCOM for internal resourcing; and if still unable, to AF/A5R with the most current TIK and FTS status.  AF/A5R coordinates with AF/TEP and SAF/AQP to assess  the  impacts  and  source  assets  based  on  priority  of  all  available  TIK  and  FTS.  AFOTEC  will  validate  their  own  unplanned  test  requirement  requests  at  the  O-6  level  and forward their requirement  through the  Lead MAJCOM to  the weapon program  office, or to AF/TEP directly,  as appropriate. (T-1)   In all cases, if the request  is  supported, the support determination addresses reimbursement for the replacement cost of the TIK and/or FTS from the appropriate agency or program. 4.2.  AF/TEP notifies SAF/IA (Weapons Division) if reprioritization or allocation from other programs results in changes or delays to foreign test programs involving USAF munitions. DEVIN L.
