General.  This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for operating the E-9A aircraft.  Use it in  conjunction with the aircraft flight  manuals,  FLIP, and AFI11-202V3,  General  Flight Rules, as supplemented, and other governing directives.  This volume prescribes procedures for E-9A aircraft under most circumstances but is not to be used as a substitute for sound judgment or common sense. Operations and/or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe and effective mission accomplishment.  When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source document, that document takes precedence. For matters where this AFI is the source document, waiver authority is In Accordance With (IAW) paragraph 1.4. 1.1.1.  Unit  commanders and agency directors involved with  or supporting E-9A operations shall make current copies of this AFI available to appropriate personnel. 1.2.  Applicability.  This  AFI  applies  to  aircrew  members,  support  personnel,  contractors,  and managers involved with employing E-9A aircraft. 1.3.  Key Words Explained. 1.3.1.  "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.3.2.  "Should" indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment. 1.3.3.  "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.4.  "NOTE"  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  considered  essential  to emphasize. 1.3.5.  “CAUTION”  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  which  could  result  in damage to equipment if not carefully followed. 1.3.6.  “WARNING” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed. 1.4.  Deviations.  Deviations  from  these  procedures  require  specific  approval  from  the  53 WEG/CC  unless  an  urgent  requirement  or  an  aircraft  emergency  dictates  otherwise,  in  which case the aircrew will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft. 1.5.  Waivers.  Unless  specifically  noted  otherwise  in  the  appropriate  section,  waiver  authority for  requirements  of  this  volume  is  ACC/A3  (T-2).    Waivers,  if  approved,  will  be  issued  for  a maximum of 1 year from the effective date.  ACC/A3TV is Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR) on all waiver requests to this AFI. 1.6.  Instruction Changes:  Submit recommendations for changes to this volume using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through the 53 WEG Stan/Eval. Approved AF  Forms  847  will  be  forwarded  to  HQ  ACC/A3TV  for  coordination.  HQ  USAF/A3O  is  the approval authority for changes and revisions to this instruction. 1.7.  Definitions.  Find explanations or definitions of terms and abbreviations commonly used in the  aviation  community  in  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Title  14,  Part  1;  DoD  FLIP General  Planning,  Chapter  2;  and  Joint  Pub  1-02,  The  DoD  Dictionary  of  Military  and Associated Terms. See Attachment 1 for common terms used herein. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   9  Chapter 2 COMMAND AND CONTROL 2.1.  General.  The  ACC  command  and  control  (C2)  system  is  based  on  the  principles  of centralized monitoring and decentralized control and execution.  The result is  a C2 mechanism which keeps the ACC commander informed of the current status of ACC forces while enabling the wing or group commander to exercise control over day-to-day operations.  The C2 network consists of the 53rd Wing and the 53rd Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG). 2.2.  Execution  Authority.  Commanders  with  execution  authority  formulate  plans,  allocate assets, and approve PICs to carry out directed or training missions through the C2 network.  The WEG/CC  serves  as  the  execution  authority  for  local  training  missions.    The  Squadron Commander (SQ/CC) or the designated representative assigns unit missions to PICs.  The Pilot in Command is the final authority for proper mission planning and the safe conduct of the flight. 2.3.  Pilot  in  Command  Responsibility  and  Authority.  SQ/CCs  shall  designate  an  aircraft commander  (AC),  instructor  pilot  (IP),  or  evaluator  pilot  (EP)  as  the  PIC  for  all  flights,  on  a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable supplements. An unqualified or non-mission ready pilot may not be designated as PIC.  PICs are: 2.3.1.  In  command  of  all  persons  aboard  the  aircraft  and  responsible  for  the  welfare  of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP), and passengers. 2.3.2.  Responsible for safe mission execution.  The PIC shall only fly events authorized by appropriate command supervision (C2, which represents Operations Supervisor, SQ/Director of Operations (DO), SQ/CC and/or appropriate chain of command authorities), unless in the PIC’s judgment an emergency condition demands otherwise. 2.3.3.  The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority. 2.3.4.  The final authority for requesting and accepting aircrew or mission waivers. (T-3) 2.3.5.  Responsible  for  passing  mission  progress  reports  (at  least  daily)  when  away  from home station to C2. 2.4.  Mission  Clearance  Decision.  The  execution  authority  and  PIC  shall  make  the  mission clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC.  If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may task another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions. 2.4.1.  Only  re-route  or  divert  a  mission  when  authorized  by  the  execution  authority,  to resolve an emergency, or if required by en route or terminal weather conditions. 2.4.2.  The  agency  that  directed  the  re-route  or  divert  shall  ensure  the  aircraft  is  capable  of executing departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures. 2.4.3.  The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that may preclude re-route or divert. 2.5.  Diversion.  When  a  C2  agent  directs  a  PIC  to  fly  to  an  alternate  airfield,  the  agent  will ensure  existing  and  forecast  weather  for  the  alternate,  Notices  to  Airmen  (NOTAMs),  and   10  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 airfield information  from the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) is suitable. If the  alternate  becomes  unsuitable  while  en  route,  the  PIC  will  coordinate  with  the  C2  agent  for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final authority for accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent will alert all appropriate ground service agencies of the aircraft’s impending arrival. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   11  Chapter 3 AIRCREW REQUIREMENTS 3.1.  Aircrew  Qualification.  Primary  aircrew members, or those occupying a primary position during flight, must be qualified or in training for qualification in that crew position and mission.  If  non-current  or  in  training  for  a  particular  event,  the  aircrew  member  must  be  under  the supervision of an instructor while accomplishing that event (direct supervision for critical phases of  flight).    Additionally,  commanders  and  key  supervisors  under  the  direct  supervision  of  an instructor may occupy a primary position IAW 11-401, paragraph 3.6.1. 3.1.1.  Senior leaders who complete a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight may occupy a primary crew position when under direct instructor supervision. Refer to AFI 11-401 for procedures and requirements governing senior leader flying. 3.1.2.  Crewmembers  who  complete  the  Senior  Staff  Course  will  log  FP  as  the  Flight Authorization  Duty  Code  on  the  AFTO  Form  781,  ARMS  Aircrew/Mission  Flight  Data Document. 3.1.3.  Crewmembers who complete the Senior Officer Familiarization flight will log OP as the Flight Authorization Duty Code on the AFTO Form 781. 3.2.  Crew Complement: 3.2.1.  Minimum Crew. The minimum crew is two pilots.  Mission system operators will fly dependent upon mission requirements. 3.2.2.  Aircrew members will occupy their respective seats during takeoff, approach, landing, climb and descent, emergencies (simulated and actual), and turbulent flight conditions. 3.3.  Pilots.  An  IP  must  supervise  non-current  or  unqualified  pilots  regaining  currency  or qualification (direct IP supervision during takeoffs, landings and emergency procedures). 3.3.1.  Missions  with  Passengers.  To  occupy  a  pilot‘s  seat  with  passengers  aboard,  pilots must have a current AF Form 8 for the E-9A aircraft. For takeoff, approach and landing one of the following conditions must be met: 3.3.1.1.  Two qualified and current pilots must be at the controls. 3.3.1.2.  A  qualified  pilot  non-current  no  more  than  60  days  for  flying  currency requirements  and  an  IP  providing  direct  supervision  (must  be  at  the  controls).  AC‘s regaining currency may be designated PIC. 3.3.1.3.  A qualified BMC pilot accomplishing mission qualification training (MQT) and an IP providing direct supervision. 3.3.1.4.  A qualified AC upgrade candidate on an initial or requalification mission and a qualified  IP  with  direct  supervision  of  the  controls  (AC  upgrade  candidates  will  be designated in command). 3.3.1.5.  A basic qualified (valid AF Form 8 in MDS-specific aircraft) senior officer who has completed a Senior  Officer Qualification course may  occupy  either  pilot  seat  under direct IP supervision.   12  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 3.4.  Non-Current or Unqualified Pilots.  An IP must be seated at a primary crew position with access  to  the  flight  controls  while  supervising  non-current  or  unqualified  pilots  regaining currency or qualification. 3.5.  Mission  System  Operators.  Non-current  and/or  unqualified  telemetry  (TM)  and  sea surveillance  radar  (SSR)  operators  will  fly  with  a  current  and  qualified  instructor  at  their respective  station.    Mission  system  aircrew  members  in  training  will  have  a  mission  system instructor providing direct supervision. 3.6.  Orientation  Flights.  Orientation Flights will be conducted IAW 11-401 as supplemented.  All orientation participants will be briefed IAW Attachment 2.  Rated pilots provided access to the  controls  during  critical  phases  of  flight  will  accomplish  BOLDFACE,  normal  and  critical action procedures training in the cockpit with an IP prior to flight. 3.7.  Duty Periods. 3.7.1.  Flight Duty Period (FDP) begins when the individual reports for his or her first duty period and ends at engine shutdown at the end of the mission or series of missions. However, time spent in the completion of post flight duties will not count as crew rest toward the next flight duty period. The maximum FDP is 16 hours (12 hours with an inoperative autopilot).  No planned touch-and-go or practice/simulated emergency work will be accomplished after the flight duty period extends past 12 hours. 3.7.2.  Crew Duty Time (CDT) begins when an individual reports for their first duty period. CDT  is  FDP  combined  with  post-mission  duties.  Maximum  CDT  is  18+00  hours  for  basic aircrew.  Plan  the  mission  so  aircrew  members  may  complete  post-mission  duties  within maximum CDT. 3.8.  Scheduling Restrictions.  Aircrew scheduling  will be IAW AFI 11-202V3 requirements. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   13  Chapter 4 AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS 4.1.  Objective.  This chapter applies to accepting an aircraft from maintenance prior to launch.  The ultimate objective of the aircraft maintenance team is to provide an aircraft for launch with all  equipment  operational  (Fully  Mission  Capable,  FMC).    Manpower  limitations,  skills,  and spare part availability have a negative and direct impact on mission accomplishment.  However, under specific circumstances, some missions can be safely operated without all equipment being operational.    Minimum  equipment  will  be  as  established  in  AFI  21-103  ACC  SUP  1, ADDENDUM  Q,  the  Master  Minimum  Equipment  Listing  (MMEL),  and/or  maintenance guidance. The PIC is responsible for ensuring equipment required for safe flight is operable. 4.2.  Master Minimum Equipment List Policy.  The MMEL is a pre-launch document that lists the  minimum  equipment/systems  to  operate  the  aircraft.  It  is  impractical  to  prepare  a  list  that would  anticipate  all  possible  combinations  of  equipment  malfunctions  and  contingent circumstances. Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. A PIC who  accepts  an  aircraft  with  degraded  equipment/systems  is  not  committed  to  subsequent operations  with  the  same  degraded  equipment.  PICs  are  not  committed  to  operations  with degraded equipment accepted by another PIC. 4.2.1.  The PIC is responsible for exercising the necessary judgment to ensure no aircraft is flown  with  multiple  items  inoperative  that  may  result  in  an  unsafe  degradation  and/or  an undue increase in workload.  The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during  continued  operation  with  inoperative  systems  or  components.  The  MMEL  is  not intended  for  continued  operation  over  an  indefinite  period  with  systems/subsystems inoperative. Safety of flight is paramount. 4.2.2.  All  emergency  equipment  will  be  installed  unless  specifically  exempted  by  mission requirements/directives. 4.3.  E-9A  Minimum  Essential  Subsystem  List  (MESL)  (AFI  21-103  ACC  SUP  1, ADDENDUM Q).  This applies to E-9A aircraft and lists the minimum equipment and systems to  launch  the  aircraft  under  routine  operations.  The  MESL  does  not  include  all  equipment  or systems essential to airworthiness. The MESL is not intended to promote continued operation of the aircraft for an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative. 4.4.  Waiver Protocol.  Waivers to operate with degraded equipment may be granted on a case-by-case  basis  and  only  in  exceptional  circumstances.    Waiver  authority  is  based  on  who  has operational  control (OPCON) and execution of the aircraft performing a  specific mission.  The PIC determines the need for a waiver and initiates the request. 4.4.1.  Local  Missions  (Executed  by  WEG/CC).    Waiver  authority  for  local  missions  is  the WEG/CC or designated representative. (T-3) 4.4.2.  ACC-Directed  Missions  (including  HQ  ACC  Operational  Readiness  Inspections).   Waiver authority is HQ ACC/A3. (T-2) 4.4.3.  Other Missions.  Aircrew members may request additional assistance or confirmation from their home units or ACC.   14  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 4.5.  Technical Assistance Service.  The PIC may (at any time in the decision process) request technical  support  and  additional  assistance  from  their  home  unit  and/or  maintenance representatives. 4.5.1.  PICs  electing  to  operate  with  degraded  equipment  or  aircraft  systems  (with appropriate  waiver,  if  necessary)  must  coordinate  mission  requirements  (revised  departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.) with the C2 agency before flight. 4.6.  Aircraft  Loading/Cargo  Handling.  Passenger  and  cargo  loading  will  be  in  accordance with Chapter 12 of this instruction. 4.6.1.  Cargo, including baggage, will be safely secured prior to taxi. 4.6.2.  Ensure a weight and balance computation is accomplished if cargo/passengers change the standard configuration weight and balance on aircraft. 4.7.  Arms and Ammunition.  No ammunition will be carried in magazines, clips or inserted in weapons aboard the aircraft except when approved by the PIC. 4.8.  Transportation  of  Passengers.  Passengers  are  limited  to  personnel  authorized  IAW AFI11-401/ACC Sup 1, Flight Management, and approved by the Wing Commander (WG/CC). Orientation flights may be accomplished IAW AFI 11-401/ACC Sup 1. 4.9.  Passenger  Manifest.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  a  copy  of  the  manifest  is  filed with a responsible agency at the departure point, and that sufficient copies of the manifest are in their possession before departure. 4.10.  Maintenance  and  Inspection  Records  Review.  The  AFTO  Form  781,  Aerospace Vehicle  Flight  Data  Document,  will  be  available  at  the  aircraft  when  the  crew  reports  to visually inspect  the aircraft. No aircraft system  will be activated without a pilot  first reviewing the AFTO Form 781. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   15  Chapter 5 OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES 5.1.  Checklists.  Accomplish  all  checklists  with  strict  discipline.    A  checklist  is  not  complete until  all  items  have  been  accomplished  and  all  crewmembers  have  called  it  complete.  Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and deviations specified in the flight manual, etc., are authorized.  Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be added to  the checklists in  pencil.   Aircrew  will use Air  Force Technical Orders and Checklists produced by Tinker AFB, OK. 5.1.1.  Unit  Developed  Checklists/Local  Pilot  Aids  are  authorized  and  will  be  used  for  all local flights. 5.2.  Duty  Station.  A  qualified  pilot  will  be  in  control  of  the  aircraft  at  all  times  during  the flight.    (EXCEPTION:    Unqualified  pilots  undergoing  qualification  training  and  senior  leaders who  have  completed  training  IAW  paragraph  3.1.3  of  this  volume).    Only  one  pilot  may  be absent from their duty station at a time.  During non-critical phases of flight,  aircrew members will notify the pilot before leaving and after returning to their duty stations. 5.3.  Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles: 5.3.1.  The  emergency  cabin  exits  and  cabin  safety  aisle  will  remain  unobstructed  during flight.  NOTE:    Aircraft  telemetry  antenna  modification  blocks  a  portion  of  the  right  side emergency exits. 5.3.2.  Cargo will be loaded so as to provide an unobstructed safety aisle from the cockpit to the rear of the aircraft. 5.4.  Safety Belts, Shoulder Harness and Life Vests.  The PIC will ensure crew members and passengers  have  safety  belts  securely  fastened  during  takeoffs,  approaches,  landings,  simulated emergencies and when turbulence is encountered or anticipated. 5.4.1.  When  occupying  their  crew  position,  the  pilot  and  copilot  will  have  safety  belts  and shoulder harnesses fastened at all times. 5.4.2.  Life  vests  will  be  located  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  crew  during  over  water flights so as to be accessible and worn when directed by the PIC. 5.5.  Missions with Passengers.  See Para 3.3.1 for pilot qualification requirements. 5.5.1.  Pilots  shall  not  conduct  emergency  procedure  patterns,  touch-and-go,  or  stop-and-go landings  with  passengers  on  board.  Emergency  procedure  training,  touch-and-go  and  stop-and-go landings are authorized with MEPs on board. 5.6.  Landing  Gear  and  Flap  Operating  Policy.  The  pilot  flying  (PF)  the  aircraft  will command configuration changes. The pilot  not  flying (PNF) the aircraft will verify appropriate airspeed and configuration prior, then echo the gear and/or flap actuation command, and finally, actuate the appropriate switch. 5.7.  Jumpseat/Observer  Duties.  Available  crewmembers/passengers  should  assist  in  clearing during taxi operations, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL (provided it does not distract the pilots).   16  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 5.8.  Communications  Policy.  The  Air  Force  does  not  give  a  promise  of  confidentiality  to aircrews regarding their  recorded aircraft crew  communications. Crewmembers are expected to maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times. 5.8.1.  Challenge and Response.  IAW TO 1E-9A-1, and local governing directives. 5.8.2.  Sterile  Cockpit.    Limit  conversation  to  that  essential  for  crew  coordination  and mission  accomplishment  during  taxi,  takeoff,  approach,  landing,  and  any  flight  below  400 feet AGL. 5.8.3.  Only  aircrew-essential  communications  are  permitted  from  commencement  of  the takeoff roll until passing an altitude of 400’ AGL. This applies during touch-and-go or stop-and-go landings also. 5.9.  Aircraft  Interphone.  Primary  crewmembers  will  monitor  interphone  (Net  1)  during critical phases of flight.  Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off Net 1 and notify him/her of which Net will be monitored. 5.10.  Radios. 5.10.1.  The PNF normally makes all air traffic control (ATC) radio calls. 5.10.2.  In  terminal  areas,  all  crewmembers  (if  able)  will  monitor  the  primary  radio  unless directed otherwise. 5.10.3.  The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and update the crew when the primary radio changes. 5.10.4.  Both pilots will monitor UHF guard emergency frequency. 5.11.  Advisory Calls.  The PF will periodically announce intentions during departures, arrivals, approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. Mandatory calls will be IAW squadron SOPs. 5.12.  Runway Criteria.  The PIC is responsible for determining that all airfield facilities are of suitable  construction,  width,  length  between  barriers,  and  weight  bearing  capacity  for  normal operations. 5.13.  Barrier  Operations.  Takeoff,  touch-and-gos,  and  landings  over  a  raised  cable  are  not authorized due to restricted clearance of the sea surveillance radar dome.  Taxiing over a raised cable is permitted and will be executed with caution at the discretion of the PIC. 5.14.  Minimum  Takeoff  Runway.  The  accelerate-stop  distance  corrected  by  Runway Condition Reading (RCR) must be less than 80% of usable runway available 5.15.  Minimum  Landing  Runway.  The computed landing distance must  be less than 80% of the useable landing distance (without propeller reverse) corrected for RCR. 5.16.  Landing Surface.  Operations from other than hard surfaced runways are not authorized. 5.17.  Crosswind  Limitations.  The  following  table  will  be  used  to  determine  maximum crosswind component allowed for takeoffs, full stop landings, and touch and go’s. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   17  Table 5.1.  Crosswind Limits. RCR 26-23 (Dry) 15-12 (Wet) 11-09 08-05 (Ice/Snow) 04-01 MAXIMUM CROSSWIND IN KNOTS Full Stop Touch and Go 20 15 10 05 Touch and go not authorized Touch and go not authorized Takeoff/landing not authorized  Touch and go not authorized 15 10 5.18.  Maximum  Gross  Weights.  Operating  weights  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  flight manual weight, altitude, and temperature limits. These limits will not be exceeded. 5.19.  Transfer  of  Aircraft  Control.  Will  be  positive  and  verbally  confirmed.    The  following information  will be  relayed:  Aircraft altitude, heading, airspeed, primary  navigational  aid, and whether autopilot is engaged or not. 5.20.  Altitude  Monitoring.  When  climbing  or  descending  the  PNF  will  call  1,000  feet above/below  and  level  off  altitude.  The  PNF  will  inform  the  PF  anytime  the  indicated  altitude varies more than 100 feet from the desired altitude, or if the aircraft appears to be dangerously close to terrain or obstructions. 5.21.  Landings.  All  landings  will  be  made  with  15°  degrees  of  flaps  unless  an  emergency dictates otherwise. Ensure sufficient runway is available beyond any barrier to permit a full stop landing without use of reverse. 5.22.  Touch-and-Go Landings.  Touch-and-go landings are authorized on runways with 6,000 ft or more between barriers. Procedures will be IAW squadron SOPs. 5.23.  Radar Altimeter. 5.23.1.  Any  crewmember  detecting  the  illumination  of  the  radar  altimeter  Low  Altitude Warning  Light  will immediately notify the PF. Terrain  clearance and  aircraft position must be verified. 5.23.2.  Before departure set the radar altimeter for emergency return. 5.23.3.  The  pilot  and  copilot  will  use  the  same  radar  altimeter  setting  unless  briefed otherwise. 5.23.4.  Set  the  radar  altimeter  to  the  Height  Above  Touchdown/Height  Above  Airport (HAT/HAA) during instrument approaches. 5.24.  Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS).  TCAS will be tested and audio monitored prior to and during flight if equipped.  It is imperative to follow resolution advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow the computed RA may increase  the  probability  of  a  midair  collision.  Pilots  who  deviate  from  an  ATC  clearance  in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new clearance. 5.25.  Crew Resource Management (CRM) Assertive Statement “Knock it Off" 5.25.1.  "Knock it Off" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use of "Knock it Off" will:   18  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 5.25.2.  Provide  a  clear  warning  sign  of  a  deviation,  loss  of  situational  awareness,  or dangerous situation developing. 5.25.3.  Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs. 5.25.4.  Notify  all  crewmembers  when  someone  sees  the  aircraft  or  crew  departing  from established  guidelines,  the  briefed  scenario,  or  that  someone  is  simply  uncomfortable  with the developing conditions. 5.25.5.  As soon as possible after a "Knock it Off " has been called, the aircrew will take the following actions: 5.25.5.1.  Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft and ensure terrain clearance. 5.25.5.2.  The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew. 5.25.5.3.  The  PIC  will  provide  all  other  crewmembers  with  the  opportunity  to  voice inputs relative to the stated concerns. 5.25.5.4.  After  considering  all  inputs,  the  PIC  will  direct  the  aircrew  to  continue  the current course of action or direct a new course of action. 5.26.  Operational Risk Management (ORM).  ORM is a logic based, common sense approach to  making  calculated  decisions  on  human,  material,  and  environmental  factors  before,  during, and after all operations. USAF policy on risk management is contained in AFI 11-290/ACC Sup 1. PICs are responsible for assessing ORM before flight IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as part of preflight activities. 5.27.  Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP).  The Military Aviation Safety Action Program is an identity-protected, self-reporting system modeled after successful FAA/Airline programs to encourage the voluntary reporting Operational issues and events. It is designed to provide a non- punitive  environment  for  the  open  reporting  of  safety  concerns  and  information  that  might  be critical  to  identifying  hazardous  situations  and  precursors  to  accidents.  These  safety  concerns may  be  either  observed  or  experienced  by  the  submitter.  The  goal  is  to  prevent  mishaps  by addressing those unintentional errors, hazardous situations and events, or high-risk activities not identified  and/or  correctable  by  other  methods  or  through  traditional  safety  reporting  sources. The  ASAP  website  is  accessible  at  www.safety-masap.com.  Crewmembers  can  submit comment via the Comment/Feedback link. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   19  Chapter 6 AIRCREW PROCEDURES 6.1.  General.  Procedures in this chapter are to  be used on E-9A missions. The procedures are designed to provide aircrews with standard methods of operation under normal conditions. The PIC is the final authority to operate other than standard if the situation dictates. Section 6A-Pre-Mission 6.2.  Aircrew Uniform. 6.2.1.  Aircrew  will  wear  the  aircrew  uniform,  as  outlined  in  AFI  36-2903,  Dress  and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement on all missions unless otherwise authorized. 6.2.2.  Squadron  commanders  will  determine  clothing  and  equipment  to  be  worn  or  carried aboard all flights commensurate with mission, climate and terrain involved. 6.2.3.  All aircrew members are required to wear flight gloves during critical phases of flight and  as  deemed  necessary  by  the  PIC.  Critical  phases  of  flight  is  defined  as  engine  starts, takeoffs, landings, and emergencies except where flight gloves hinder completion of required actions.  Because  of  the  inherent  protection  afforded,  crewmembers  are  encouraged  to  wear gloves at all times in the aircraft. Gloves will not have the fingers exposed or modified in any manner. 6.3.  Flight  Planning  Procedures.  Aircrews  will  perform  mission  planning  in  sufficient  detail to ensure safe and efficient mission accomplishment to include: 6.3.1.  Weight  and  Balance  Clearance  Form.  Pre-computed  DD  Forms  365-4  (or equivalent)  are  permitted.  They  must  be  available  for  ready  reference  and  kept  current  in accordance with  the contractor’s maintenance plan. The PIC is  responsible for ensuring the center of gravity is within specified limits for all flights. 6.3.2.  Weather  Briefing.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  the  best  information  available concerning  weather,  trends,  and  forecast  for  takeoff,  the  proposed  route,  destination,  buoy data for mission sorties, and alternate airfields. 6.3.3.  Takeoff  and  Landing  Data  (TOLD)  Computations.  A  TOLD  card  will  be computed for every mission and will cover the conditions existing at the takeoff location. 6.4.  Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). 6.4.1.  Crewmembers  will  review  FCIF,  Volume  1,  before  all  missions  or  ground  aircrew duties,  and  update  the  FCIF  currency  record  with  the  latest  FCIF  item  number,  date,  and crewmember's  initials.    Note:    Electronic  signatures,  or  PEX  Sign-Off,  may  be  used  on FCIFs. 6.4.2.  Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF review or joining a mission en route will receive an FCIF update from the PIC. Instructor pilots who fly with general officers are responsible for briefing appropriate FCIF items. 6.4.3.  Crewmembers  not  assigned  or  attached  to  the  unit  operating  a  mission  will  certify FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials after their name on the file   20  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 copy  of  the  flight  authorization  or  file  copy  of  their  crew  orders.  This  applies  to  all crewmembers if the electronic sign-in system is not working at show time. 6.5.  Flight Kit Requirements.  The following items will be carried as applicable: 6.5.1.  AFI 11-202V3 and ACC Sup 1. 6.5.2.  Aircraft  Flight  Manual  (TO  1E-9A-1,  TO  1E-9A-1CL-1,  TO  1E-9A-1CL-2,  and DeHavilland Manual) 6.5.3.  Operating Data Manual (DeHavilland Manual) 6.5.4.

Supplemental  weight  and  balance  handbook  to  include  a  DD  Form  365-4  (or equivalent) with standard setups (i.e., 2 pilots, 2 crew, and a full fuel load). 6.6.  Mission Planning: 6.6.1.  A  pilot  and  telemetry  operator  will  attend  the  Weapon  System  Evaluation  Program (WSEP) pre-briefs unless missions dictate not attending. The PIC is responsible for gathering all  pertinent  mission  information.  For  non-WSEP  missions,  the  telemetry  operator  and  PIC (if able) should coordinate mission requirements with the customer. 6.6.2.  The  crew  briefing  should  occur  NLT  one  hour  prior  to  planned  takeoff.  All  crew members  should  come  to  the  crew  briefing  knowing  what  is  needed  to  accomplish  their portion of the mission. The main focus of the crew briefing should be a discussion on how the crew will act as a team to best accomplish the particular mission safely. 6.7.  Performance  Data.  All  factors  which  affect  the  performance  of  the  airplane  will  be considered  when  computing  takeoff  data.  Any  one  factor  or  combination  of  factors  can jeopardize the safe accomplishment of the takeoff. Pilots should have complete understanding of the  effects  of  gross  weight,  temperature,  pressure  altitude,  runway  available,  runway  gradient, runway condition, and wind on the airplane performance. 6.8.  Flap  Setting.  Takeoff  flap  setting  will  be  5  degrees  unless  runway  or  climb  out requirements dictate otherwise.  Takeoff with 0 degrees flaps is not authorized. 6.8.1.  Mandatory callouts will be IAW the Squadron Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Section 6B – Pre-departure 6.9.  Preflight.  The PIC ensures the following are accomplished before departure. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   21  6.10.  Briefing/Debriefing: 6.10.1.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  presenting  a  logical  briefing  that  will  promote  safe, effective mission accomplishment and crew coordination. All crewmembers will attend these briefings  unless  excused  by  the  PIC.  Regardless,  all  crewmembers  will  be  briefed  prior  to engine start. Briefing guides will be used to provide the briefer with a reference list of items that  may  apply  to  particular  missions.  Items  listed  may  be  briefed  in  any  sequence.  The briefer  should  tailor  the  briefing  to  the  experience  level  of  the  aircrew  participating  in  the mission as well as the difficulty of the mission. 6.10.2.  Briefings should begin at least 1 hour before scheduled takeoff time. 6.10.3.  An alternate mission will be briefed for each flight. Other than basic instrument and transition  sorties,  specifically  brief  the  Operations  Supervisor  for  approval  of  alternate mission profile. 6.11.  AFTO Forms 781 Series. 6.11.1.  Review  AFTO  Forms  781  series  before  applying  power  to  the  aircraft  or  operating aircraft  systems.  Any  exceptional  release  must  be  signed  before  flight.  A  maintenance officer,  maintenance  superintendent,  or  authorized  civilian  normally  signs  the  exceptional release. If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release. Ensure that the DD Form 1896, DoD Fuel Identaplate, and Multi Service Corporation (MSC) AIR Card (AIR Card) are aboard the aircraft. 6.11.2.  One-Time  Flights.  An  aircraft  may  be  released  for  one-time  flight  with  a  condition that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another station for maintenance. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,  Documentation,  Policies,  and  Procedures,  for  downgrade  authority  and procedures.  After  the  maintenance  release  is  obtained,  coordinate  sortie  requirements  with the controlling agency. The PIC’s concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown. 6.12.  FMS  Verification.  Both  pilots  will  verify  waypoint  data  inserted  into  the  Flight Management System (FMS). 6.13.  Oxygen Requirements.  Oxygen will be used as prescribed in AFI 11-202V3/ACC Sup 1 or the flight manual, whichever is more restrictive. 6.14.  Navigational  Aids.  Applicable  navigational  aids  will  be  tuned  and  identified  prior  to departure to ensure accurate aircraft positioning. 6.15.  Operational Risk Management (ORM).  ORM is a logic based, common sense approach to  making  calculated  decisions  on  human,  material,  and  environmental  factors  before,  during, and  after  all  operations.  USAF  policy  on  Risk  Management  is  contained  in  AFI  90-802,  Risk Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as part of preflight activities. 6.15.1.  Flying units will develop a local ORM program to include personal ORM assessment for all missions and accomplished by all crewmembers prior to each flight. Section 6C - Departure: 6.16.  Taxi.  All  checklists  will  be  accomplished  IAW  applicable  flight  manuals  and  local governing directives.   22  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 6.16.1.  During ground operations in congested areas, all aircrew members will devote their full attention to clearing the aircraft. 6.16.2.  Do  not  taxi  an  aircraft  within  25  feet  of  obstructions  without  wing  walkers monitoring  the  clearance  between  aircraft  and  obstructions.  With  wing  walkers,  avoid  taxi obstructions  by  at  least  10  feet.  EXCEPTION:  IAW  AFI  11-218  Aircraft  Operations  and Movement on the Ground, aircraft may taxi without marshalers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines which have been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from  any  obstruction  and  the  obstruction  is  permanent.  Parked  aircraft  (e.g.  on  the  WSEP ramp) are not considered permanent, and 25 feet of clearance, or a wing walker, is required. 6.16.3.  The reverse taxi capability of the E-9 will not be utilized, except in an emergency. 6.16.4.  Aircraft  will  not  be  taxied  with  malfunctions  that  affect  the  gear,  the  nose  wheel steering, or brake systems. 6.17.  Takeoff, Departure, Climb, and Cruise: 6.17.1.  Takeoff, Departure, and Climb Briefing.  The pilot performing the takeoff, departure, and climb will accomplish this IAW TO 1E-9A-1CL-1. 6.17.2.  Takeoff.    Takeoff  weather  minimums  will  be  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202V3/ACC Sup 1. 6.17.3.  Takeoff  Performance.    To  obtain  the  best  takeoff  performance,  prescribed  takeoff procedures  should  be  followed  exactly.  Airplane  performance,  as  predicted  by  the  Aircraft Dash-1 performance section, can only be achieved by following the procedures contained in this section. These procedures result in the safest possible operation of the airplane. 6.17.4.  Engine-Out Takeoff.  Engine-out takeoffs are not authorized. 6.18.  Takeoff  Aborts.  If  a  takeoff  abort  occurs  (regardless  of  airspeed),  the  crew  will accomplish  the  full  stop  taxi-back  checklist  if  another  takeoff  will  be  attempted.  Determine maximum  braking  energy  and  consider  the  possibility  of  cumulative  effects  of  hot  brakes  if  a subsequent abort occurs. 6.19.  On-Time  Takeoffs.  Mission  departures  are  on  time  if  the  aircraft  is  airborne  within  15 minutes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement. 6.19.1.  Early Departures.  Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to weather, ATC restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational  limitations, to adjust mission flow during a large-scale operation, or if approved through C2 channels provided the impact on local  and downrange facilities and crew duty is evaluated. 6.20.  Departure/Approach  Briefing.  The  pilot  who  will  perform  the  takeoff  will  accomplish the  departure  briefing.  This  briefing  will  be  completed  prior  to  taxiing  onto  the  runway  for takeoff.  The  approach  briefing  will  be  accomplished  in  conjunction  with  the  descent  or  traffic pattern checklist. 6.21.  Takeoff, Climb, and Cruise. 6.21.1.  For normal missions in the Gulf Range the E-9A should fly a stereo flight plan. 6.21.2.  The E-9A will fly IFR to the maximum extent possible. If unable to proceed IFR into working airspace, the following procedures are available: AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   23  6.21.2.1.  Hold  outside  of  airspace  IFR  with  the  controlling  agency  until  scheduled airspace becomes available, and IFR entry is permissible. 6.21.2.2.  Proceed  IFR down a  corridor until  scheduled airspace becomes available,  and IFR entry is permissible. 6.21.2.3.  Proceed  VFR  into  the  airspace  if  able  to  maintain  Visual  Meteorological Conditions  (VMC).    Request  flight  following,  and  updates  on  aircraft  working  in  the airspace. Work to coordinate for airspace below 7,000 MSL to accomplish range sweep. 6.21.3.  At no time will E-9A aircraft penetrate warning area airspace without knowledge of, or coordination with the controlling agency or players. This presents an unacceptable hazard to both E-9A and other aircrews. 6.22.  In-flight  Emergency  Procedures.  The  PIC  shall  report  deviations  from  directives  that may  occur  as  a  result  of  an  emergency  according  to  AFI  11-202V3.  Time  and  conditions permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions. 6.22.1.  When  practical  after  completing  the  aircraft  emergency  action  checklists  and associated actions, the PIC shall furnish ATC and appropriate C2 agencies with a description of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any other pertinent information.  Follow tech order 1E-9A -1 guidance for emergency procedure actions. 6.23.  Air  Aborts.  The  mission  will  be  aborted,  regardless  of  apparent  damage  or  subsequent normal operation, for any of the following: 6.23.1.  Birdstrike/Foreign Object Damage. 6.23.2.  Over-G. The aircraft will land when practical out of a straight-in approach. 6.23.3.  Flight control system malfunctions. 6.23.4.  Engine flameout or unplanned shutdown. 6.24.  Weather Minimums for Takeoff:  See Table 6.1 below. Table 6.1.  Weather Minimums for Takeoff. MISSION  Operational  All others  REMARKS  VIS  1000 RVR   When less than RVR 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR 1000, the crew may take off if mission priority dictates, provided the runway has dual RVR readouts and displays (minimum RVR 1000 on both) and runway centerline lighting is operational. For any takeoff below 1600 RVR, the crew must be fully qualified.  For runways with more than one operating RVR readout, RVR must read 1600 minimum on all.  1600 RVR  NOTES:  If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to be 1/2 mile (800 meters).  When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling or visibility) a takeoff alternate is required (See paragraph 6.27.)    24  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 6.25.  Alternate Planning.  Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3. Choose  alternates  that  best  meet  mission  requirements  and  conserve  fuel;  they  should  not  be within  the  same  terminal  area,  if  terminal  forecasts  are  marginal.  Select  alternates  that  are  not restricted by FLIP and are compatible with the mission load and performance characteristics of the  aircraft.    The  PIC  retains  final  authority  in  the  choice  of  alternates;  however,  selection  by support  agencies  normally  should  be  used  if  they  meet  the  above  criteria  and  the  aircraft  has already been serviced. 6.26.  Departure Alternates. 6.26.1.  A  departure  alternate  is  required  if  weather  (ceiling  or  visibility)  is  below  landing minimums for the available approach (at departure aerodrome). 6.26.2.  Suitability  of  Departure  Alternates.  When  a  departure  alternate  is  required,  the aircraft  must  be  capable  of  maintaining  the  minimum  enroute  altitude  (MEA)  or  minimum obstruction  clearance  altitude  (MOCA),  whichever  is  higher,  to  the  alternate  using  one engine inoperative (OEI) performance criteria. To qualify as a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions: 6.26.2.1.  For  an  alternate  within  30  minutes  flying  time,  the  existing  weather  must  be equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1 hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or; 6.26.2.2.  For an alternate within 1 hour flying time, the existing weather must be at least 500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than 600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for 1 hour after ETA at the alternate. 6.27.  Destination Requirements (for filing purposes).  Plan fuel to an alternate only when 11-202V3 requires filing of an alternate. The forecast destination weather will be according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following: 6.27.1.  File two alternates when: 6.27.1.1.  The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the available DoD precision approach; or: 6.27.1.2.  The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected for RCR. 6.27.2.  When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews may use holding in lieu of an alternate airport. In such situations, use 2+00 hours reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate  and  0+45  reserve).  For  remote  destinations,  reserve  and  contingency  fuel,  will  be computed  using  consumption  rates  providing  maximum  endurance  at  20,000  feet  MSL  at destination gross weight. A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours of flying time. The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria: 6.27.2.1.  The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and: AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   25  6.27.2.2.  The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-precision  approach  minimums  (excluding  ASR),  but  not  below  precision  approach minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours). NOTE: See Chapter 10, Table 10.1, this AFI, for fuel planning considerations to a remote or island destination. Section 6D – Enroute/Mission Execution. 6.28.  Flight  Progress.  In-flight,  use  all  available  navigational  aids to  monitor  FMS performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability that degrades centerline accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control center (ARTCC). 6.29.  Operations Under Adverse Conditions.  The following guidance will be strictly adhered to: 6.29.1.  Thunderstorms.    There  is  no  mission  which  requires  intentional  penetration  of  a thunderstorm. Aircrews will follow guidance in AFI 11-202V3/ACC Sup 1. 6.29.2.  When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C or below, refer to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section D, Temperature Correction Chart,  to  correct  MDA,  DH,  and  other  altitudes  inside  the    Final  Approach  Fix  (FAF).  Additional procedures for temperature corrections beyond the requirements listed in the FIH are contained in AFI 11-202V3/ACC Sup 1. 6.29.3.  Do  not  fly  into  an  area  of  known  or  forecast  moderate  or  greater  mountain  wave turbulence. 6.29.4.  Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds. If  unable  to  vertically  clear  thunderstorms  or  cumulonimbus  clouds  by  at  least  2000  feet, avoid them by at least: 6.29.4.1.  20  NM at or above flight level (FL)230. 6.29.4.2.  10  NM below FL230, or: 6.29.4.3.  5    NM  for  low-level  operations  below  FL230  provided  the  outside  air temperature is at or above 0°C at flight altitude.  Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly  moving  thunderstorm.    CAUTION:  Aircraft  damage  may  occur  20NM  or  more from  any  thunderstorm.    Aircrews  must  familiarize  themselves  with  information  on thunderstorm  development  and  hazards.    Refer  to  AFH  11-203,  Volumes  1  and  2, Weather for Aircrews. 6.29.5.  The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be used to  assist  in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant  weather.  It  should never  be  considered  a  normal  avoidance  procedure.    When  relying  exclusively  on  ground-based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by: 6.29.5.1.  Changing routing. 6.29.5.2.  Diverting to alternate. 6.29.5.3.  Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.   26  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 6.29.6.  Aircrews  should  avoid  flying  in  areas  of  recently  dissipated  thunderstorms  and advected  clouds  (horizontal  movement  of  clouds  caused  by  wind)  downwind  of thunderstorms. 6.29.7.  In  order  to  minimize  exposure  to  thunderstorm  hazards  when  approaching  or departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast: 6.29.7.1.  Attempt to maintain VMC. 6.29.7.2.  Maintain at least 5 NM separation from heavy rain showers. 6.29.7.3.  Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e. clouds within plus or minus 5,000 feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level.  NOTE: Approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NM providing they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds, gusts fronts,  heavy  rain,  wind  shear,  or  microburst)  at  the  airport,  and  are  not  forecast  or observed  to  be  moving  in  the  direction  of  the  route  of  flight  (to  include  the  planned missed approach corridor, if applicable). 6.29.8.  Missions will not be planned into areas of forecast severe turbulence. 6.29.9.  Significant  Meteorological  Information  (SIGMET).    National  Weather  Service  in-flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft.  Contact the nearest military weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable. 6.29.10.  Severe Weather Penetration. Flight through severe weather should not be attempted.  However,  if  unavoidable,  prior  to  severe  weather  penetration,  appropriate  flight  manual procedures will be accomplished. 6.29.11.  Intentional  flight  into  areas  of  known  or  forecast  freezing  rain  or  severe  icing  is prohibited. Cruising flight in moderate icing is permissible provided all de-ice equipment is operating and mission requirements will not  allow for alternate profiles.  The E-9A will not takeoff with suspected snow/ice on aircraft surfaces. 6.30.  Range Patrol: 6.30.1.  Initial  range  patrol  will  be  accomplished  at  an  altitude  that  the  radar  operator determines  to  be  the  best  for  that  day,  but  all  attempts  will  be  made  to  keep  UHF  radio contact  with  the  controlling  agency.    Normally  altitudes  from  5,000  ft  to  8,000  ft  work  for initial  range  patrol.  If  radio  contact  cannot  be  maintained,  the  crew  will  inform  the controlling agency prior to ascending.  They will give an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) of when they will descend back to an altitude where radio contact can maintained. 6.30.2.  After the initial range patrol, the SSR operator will receive “boats of interest” (BOI) information from the Range Safety Officer (RSO) and coordinate with the crew on verifying contacts.    The  radar  operator  should  pass  current  latitude,  longitude,  heading,  and  speed  of the BOI to the RSO if the contacts pose a threat to the shoot track.  If the radar system is not able to keep updates on the boats of interest, the radar operator will convey this to the RSO and  pilots  as  soon  as  possible.    The  pilots  will  provide  a  stable  platform  and  make  every attempt  to  allow  the  radar  system  to  update  all  BOI.  If  the  crew  believes  that  they  will  be unable  to  update  a  boat  of  concern  for  a  period  longer  than  30  minutes,  the  SSR  operator (callsign “Vanna”) will inform the RSO.  This call will include the contact number and the last time of known update. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   27  6.31.  Telemetry Receiving/Recording/Relaying: 6.31.1.  The  crew  should  hold  at  the  altitude  and  standoff  distance  discussed  in  mission planning, unless conditions dictate otherwise. 6.31.2.  Telemetry gathering may dictate bringing the wing up or down to improve telemetry data quality.  Pilots may either use the rudder trim or manually step on the rudder to bring the wing up or down. 6.31.3.  Care must be exercised when changing power during telemetry collection. 6.31.4.  As airspeed decreases below 135-130 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS) the outboard spoilers  become  effective.  If  the  aircraft  is  in  a  slip  to  bring  the  wing  up  for  telemetry collection and the plane slows through this speed the spoilers become effective immediately and bobble the wing.  This bobble equates to decreased performance of the telemetry antenna and  therefore  transitioning  through  these  speeds  should  be  avoided  during  telemetry receiving. 6.31.5.  Minimum  airspeed  of  1.3VS  will  be  observed.    Landing  gear  horn  actuation  should be avoided. 6.32.  UHF Relay: 6.32.1.  The E-9A is equipped with 4 UHF radios capable of relaying two different pairs of frequencies.  Two of the four radios are labeled Air-to-Ground; the other two are labeled Air-to-Air.    Each-Air  to-Ground  radio  is  paired  with  an  Air-to-Air  radio  to  allow  for  the  relay.  Due to this set up, radios are described as Air-to-Air 1, Air-to-Ground 1, Air-to-Air 2, & Air-to-Ground 2.  Do not tune/transmit on UHF 2 radio (copilot’s side) if the same frequency is in  one  of  the  Air-to-Ground  radios.    The  Air-to-Ground  radio  antennas  and  the  UHF  2 antenna  are  in  close  proximity  and  could  damage  each  other  when  simultaneously transmitting.    If  a  SSR  operator  is  aboard,  the  PIC  may  designate  him/her  with  UHF  relay operation responsibilities. Section 6E – Arrival 6.33.  Descent.  Obtain  approach  and  landing  weather,  compute  landing  data,  and  review  the planned initial  descent  and approach.   This  initial  review will, at minimum,  include navigation aid  frequencies,  minimum  and  emergency  safe  altitudes,  descent  rates,  minimums  for  the approach to  be flown, missed approach procedures, landing  ground roll  and flare distance,  and aerodrome  sketch.  The  pilot  flying  the  approach  will  brief  the  crew  on  the  descent  rate, Minimum  Descent  Altitude  (MDA)/Decision  Height  (DH)/Vision  Descent  Point  (VDP),  and missed  approach/climb  out  procedures.  Lost  communications  procedures  will  be  coordinated  if required.  During  the  descent  and  approaches,  other  crewmembers  will  back  up  the  pilot  flying the approach and report any deviation from prescribed procedures. 6.33.1.  Both pilots flying the approach will set the radio altimeter MDA index to the Height Above Touchdown (HAT) or Height Above Airport (HAA) for the approach being flown. 6.34.  Instrument  Approaches:  The  E-9A  is  a  category  “B”  aircraft.    If  an  approach  will  be flown  at  greater  than  120  KIAS,  use  category  “C”  minimums.    Prior  to  starting  an  instrument approach,  pilots  will  confirm  that  their  aircraft  can  comply  with  the  missed  approach  climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202 V3.   28  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 6.34.1.  It is the pilot’s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior to descent. 6.34.2.  Night  and  Marginal  Weather  Operations.    Fly  a  precision  approach,  if  available,  at night or during marginal weather.  If a precision approach is not available, fly any approved instrument  approach.    A  visual  approach  may  be  flown  during  night  VFR  conditions,  if  an approved instrument approach procedure is not available or mission requires a non-standard approach. 6.34.2.1.  On  training/evaluation  flights  at  familiar  fields,  pilots  may  fly  non-precision approaches or VFR traffic patterns to accomplish required training and evaluations.  The pilot  monitoring  (PM)  will  monitor  a  precision  approach  when  practical  to  enhance safety. 6.34.2.2.  For recovery at  home station, pilots may  elect  to  fly a visual or non-precision approach, if weather minimums permit. 6.35.  Instrument Approach Procedures.  Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an enroute descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be: 6.35.1.  At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches. 6.35.1.1.  For  precision  approaches,  visibility  will  be  no  lower  than  RVR  2400  (730 meters) or 1/2  mile visibility (800 meters) with  no RVR readout  available.  DH will be based on a HAT of no less than 200 feet. 6.35.1.2.  At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches. 6.35.1.3.  If  the  ceiling  is  below  the  value  depicted  for  published  DoD  precision approach,  but  visibility  is  at  or  above  authorized  minimums,  comply  with  fuel requirements before initiating enroute descent, penetration or approach. 6.35.2.  Established  on  a  segment  of  the  approach.  When  cleared  for  or  established  on  a segment  of  the  approach  and  weather  is  reported  or  observed  to  be  below  approach minimums,  the  PF  has  the  option  of  continuing  the  approach  to  the  missed  approach  point (MAP)/DH.   If the approach is abandoned, level off (or descend if lower altitude is required for the missed approach procedure).  Comply with the last assigned clearance until a new or amended clearance is received. 6.35.2.1.  Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing. 6.35.2.2.  If  the  approach  is  continued,  the  PIC  must  have  sufficient  fuel  available  to complete  the  approach  and  missed  approach,  and  proceed  to  a  suitable  alternate  with normal fuel reserve. 6.35.2.3.  The  PIC  has  the  final  responsibility  for  determining  when  the  destination  is below designated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request. 6.35.3.  Holding.  An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but forecast to improve to or above minimums provided: 6.35.3.1.  The  aircraft  has  more  fuel  remaining  than  required  to  fly  to  the  alternate  and hold for the appropriate holding time, and weather at the alternate is forecast to remain at above filing minimums for the period. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   29  6.35.3.2.  Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel will be consumed. 6.36.  Stabilized Approach.  Unstable approaches are primary contributors to numerous military and civilian mishaps. Stabilized approaches are essential for the safe operation of aircraft and are mandatory. The following criteria define specific parameters that mitigate risk during this critical phase of flight. This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate corrective actions to stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters. 6.36.1.  The following criteria apply to all approaches: 6.36.1.1.  At 1000 feet AGL: 6.36.1.1.1.  Aircraft is in approach configuration. Circling configuration is acceptable for circling approaches. NOTE: In those cases where VFR traffic pattern is 1,000 feet AGL  (as  opposed  to  1,500  feet),  the  aircraft  will  be  configured  for  landing  prior  to commencing the base turn to final. 6.36.1.1.2.  Airspeed is appropriate for the configuration and conditions. 6.36.1.1.3.  Sink  rate  is  no  greater  than  1200-1500  fpm.  NOTE:  Under  certain conditions  (WX,  Threats,  Terrain,  etc.)  some  IAPs  and  Tactical  Approaches  may require greater than a 1000 fpm descent rate. 6.36.1.1.3.1.  Non-precision  Approaches.  A  recommended to calculate  a  constant  descent  gradient  profile  from  the  FAF  altitude  to  the  VDP.  This  is  considered  the  safest  profile.  During  a  go-around,  ensure  descent  below the MDA does not occur. technique is 6.36.1.1.4.  All  briefings  and  checklists  are  complete  unless  contrary  to  T.O. guidance. 6.36.1.1.5.  Aircraft is on the correct track. 6.36.1.1.6.  Aircraft  in  the  correct  bank  angle  to  maintain  proper  approach  track  for instrument, circling, or visual/tactical approach. 6.36.1.1.7.  Power set to maintain the descent profile at approach speed. 6.36.1.1.8.  If these criteria are not met by 1000 feet AGL, the PM will announce the deviation  and the PF will take immediate corrective action.  PM states “1000 xxxx,” where “xxxx” equates to a concise description of the unstable characteristic(s) which clearly  relay  to  the  PF  what  actions  are  required  to  return  the  aircraft  to  a  stable platform.    Examples:  “1000,  fast,”  or  “1000,  half  dot  low”.  If  criteria  are  met,  PM will simply state “1000.” 6.36.1.2.  From  500  AGL  to  the  runway,  if  these  parameters  are  exceeded  the  PM  will announce “Go-Around” and the PF will execute a go-around/missed approach. If criteria for stable approach are met, the PM will state “500.” 6.36.1.2.1.  Parameters are the same as those at 1000 feet AGL. 6.36.1.2.2.  If unstable at 500’ crews should perform a go-around.   30  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 6.36.1.3.  From 300’ AGL to the  runway, if these parameters are exceeded the PM will announce “Go-Around” and the PF will execute a go-around/missed approach. If criteria for stable approach are met, the PM will state “300’, Stable.” 6.36.1.3.1.  Momentary minor corrections or deviations are acceptable and defined as: 6.36.1.3.1.1.  Airspeed: +10/-5 kts from target 6.36.1.3.1.2.  Bank Angle: +/- 15 degrees 6.36.1.3.1.3.  Rate of Descent: +/- 300 FPM from target 6.37.  Closed  Traffic  Patterns.  Initiate  the  pattern  at  the  departure  end  of  the  runway  unless directed/cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. Section 6F – Post Flight/Miscellaneous 6.38.  Loading  and  Offloading  of  Personnel.  The  loading/offloading  of  passengers  and/or cargo  through  the  aircrew  entrance  door  is  permitted.    The  PIC  will  ensure  the  number  one engine is shut-down and propeller has stopped rotating before allowing personnel and/or cargo to enplane  or  deplane  the  aircraft.An  aircrew  member  or  crew  chief  will  be  positioned  at  the  air stair door to assist passengers and keep them clear of the aircraft’s propeller arc (forward of the plane extending perpendicular to the fuselage from the rear of the air stair door). 6.38.1.  The  loading/offloading  of  passengers  and/or  cargo  through  the  cargo  door  is permitted.  The PIC will ensure the number one engine is placed in the START/FEATHER position before any personnel and/or cargo are loaded or offloaded. 6.39.  Cross-Country (X/C) Procedures: 6.39.1.  Review/Approval.  All off-station training and cross country sorties that will remain overnight will be approved IAW ACCI 11-261, Cross Country Operations. 6.39.2.  Enroute  Reporting.    Any  enroute  changes  in  itinerary  must  be  coordinated  and approved through C2. 6.39.3.  Refueling  and  Servicing.    Aircrews  should  have  refueling  instructions,  oil  and oxygen  servicing  instructions,  and  extra  oil  onboard  the  aircraft.    In  absence  of  qualified maintenance personnel,  crewmembers will check the engines oil level within 30 minutes of engine shutdown. 6.40.  Night Flying Operations.  Night flying operations are authorized.  Pilots must be current and qualified IAW AFI 11-2E-9V1.  If night flying operations must be conducted without a night flying  current  pilot,  an  instructor  pilot  must  be  at  the  controls  (left  or  right  seat)  throught  the mission. 6.41.  Cockpit  Voice  Recorder.  If  involved  in  a  mishap  or  incident,  after  landing  and terminating the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker (if safety allows). AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   31  Chapter 7 AIRCREW SECURITY PROCEDURES 7.1.  General.  This  chapter provides  guidance on aircraft security and preventing  and resisting aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the E-9A  aircraft.    AFI 13-207, Preventing  and Resisting Aircraft Piracy  (Hijacking),  AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense  (FOUO),  FAA  Notice  (FAAN)  7110.422, Aircraft  Hijack  and  Suspicious  Inflight  Activities  -  Response  and  Notification  Procedures,  and specific MAJCOM security publications contain additional guidance.  Aircrews will not release information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public. 7.2.  Security.  The PIC determines the adequacy of local security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter.  If he or she determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft  will  depart  to  a  station  where  adequate  security  is  available.    Aircraft  security  at  non-United States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency. 7.2.1.  Security personnel must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security POC must be identified to the PIC. 7.2.2.  Securing.  Secure  the  aircraft  during  a  remain  overnight  (RON)  on  non-secure  ramps with tampering tape placed on the crew entrance door and cargo door. 7.3.  Arrival.  On  arrival,  the  PIC  will  assess  the  local  situation  and  ensure  the  aircraft  and equipment are properly secured. 7.4.  Inadequate  Security.  If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate and the PIC determines the safety  of the aircraft is  in  question, the PIC may  waive the FDP  limits  and crew  rest  requirements  and  depart  as  soon  as  possible  for  a  base/airport  considered  secure.  Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as practical.  If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability.  In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security  when  the  airframe  may  be  at  risk.    The  PIC  should  rotate  a  security  detail  among  the crew  to  provide  for  both  aircraft  protection  and  crew  rest  until  relief  is  available.    Request security assistance from the nearest DoD installation or law enforcement agencies as appropriate. 7.5.  Entry  Control  Procedures.  Unescorted entry is  granted to  aircrew  members and support personnel  assigned  to  the  mission  who  possess  their  home  station  AF  Form  1199,  Air  Force Entry  Control  Card,  supported  by  an  Entry  Access  List  (EAL)  or  aircrew  orders.    Aircrew members are authorized escort authority. 7.6.  Detecting Unauthorized Entry. 7.6.1.  When  parking  on  a  secure  ramp,  the  aircraft  will  normally  be  left  unsealed  to  allow ground personnel immediate access.  If, in the PIC judgment, the aircraft needs to be secured in order to detect unauthorized entry, then: 7.6.1.1.  Use  available  aircraft  ground  security  procedures/recommendations  at destination. 7.6.1.2.  Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tamper tape outside or inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).   32  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 7.6.1.3.  Close and secure all doors and exits. 7.6.1.4.  Wipe the immediate area around latches clean to aid in investigation of a forced entry. 7.6.1.5.  Report  any  unauthorized  entry  or  tampering  to  the  Office  of  Special Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency.  Have aircraft thoroughly inspected prior to flight. 7.6.2.  Security  awareness  is  crucial  to  effective  mission  accomplishment.    Aircrews  must always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.  In  addition  to  normal  preflight  activities,  aircrews  must  inspect  areas  of  the  aircraft  not covered by normal preflight duties, to include inside inboard main  landing gear doors, nose wheel  compartment,  and  the  aft  avionics  bay  for  unfamiliar  devices.  Report  any  suspicious items  to  host  security  forces.    Aircrews  will  maintain  a  heightened  security  posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   33  Chapter 8 AIRCREW OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS 8.1.  General.  This  chapter  provides  guidelines  for  worksheets,  reports,  and  forms  associated with  E-9A  operational  activities.    Consult  governing  instruction  or  contact  wing,  unit,  or  local flight safety officers for assistance with safety forms. 8.2.  AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report.  The AF Form 457 is a tool to notify supervisors and commanders  of  a  hazardous  condition  that  requires  prompt  corrective  action.    For  hazardous weather, complete the front side of an AF Form 457 and send it to the parent wing flying safety office.  Ensure the parent unit receives it within 5 days of the event.  For more information, see AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. 8.3.  AF  Form  651,  Hazardous  Air  Traffic  Report  (HATR).  The  AF  Form  651  is  a  tool  to report near midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions.  See Attachment 3 of AFI 91-202 for more information concerning the HATR program. 8.3.1.  AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, list HATR reportable incidents. 8.3.2.  The PIC shall report the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g. center, Flight Service Station (FSS), control tower, or aeronautical radio station) as quickly as safety allows. Include the following information in the radio call (as appropriate): 8.3.2.1.  Aircraft identification or call sign. 8.3.2.2.  Time  and  place  (radial/DME  of  NAVAID,  position  relative  to  the  airfield, incident, etc). 8.3.2.3.  Altitude or flight level. 8.3.2.4.  Description of the other aircraft or vehicle. 8.3.2.5.  Advise controlling ATC agency that the PIC will file a HATR upon landing. 8.3.3.  Deadline  to  file  a  HATR  is  24  hours  after  event  via  any  communication  mode available.    If  landing  airport  has  a  USAF  airfield  management  function,  submit  completed AF  Form  651  to  the  airfield  management  officer  for  forwarding  to  wing  safety  office.  If landing  airport  does  not  have  an  airfield  management  office,  notify  the  safety  office  of  the Air  Force  base  nearest  to  location  where  the  condition  occurred,  PIC‘s  home  base  safety office,  or  as  prescribed  by  overseas  MAJCOM.    In  that  case,  provide  contact  sufficient information to prepare AF Form 651. 8.3.4.  Grant individuals who submit a HATR immunity from disciplinary action provided: 8.3.4.1.  If they were the offending party, their violation was not deliberate. 8.3.4.2.  They committed no criminal offense. 8.3.4.3.  Their actions did not result in a mishap. 8.3.4.4.  They properly reported the incident using procedures above.   34  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 8.4.  Report Violations, Unusual Events, or Circumstances.  PICs shall document events that require them to deviate from AFI 11-202V3 (unless waived by appropriate authority) or alleged navigation errors (include over-water position errors over 24NM, border, or ATC violations). 8.4.1.  Describe deviation(s) using the following report format: 8.4.1.1.  Facts. Report pertinent details of the event. 8.4.1.2.  Investigation  and  analysis.  Report  circumstances  which deviation(s). required/drove 8.4.1.3.  Findings and conclusions. 8.4.1.4.  Recommendations to prevent recurrence. 8.4.1.5.  Corrective actions taken. 8.5.  Unusual Events.  PICs shall expeditiously report unusual events/circumstances that impact their mission to appropriate MAJCOM agencies.  Reportable events include, but are not limited to, spectrum interference, interception, fuel dumping, multiple engine failure, hostile fire, injury to  passenger  or  aircrew  member,  etc.    This  list  is  not  all  exhaustive.    Most  events  require  C2 agents  to  forward  OPREP  reports  to  higher  headquarters.  In  all  cases,  pass  the  ―who,  what, when, where, why, and how of the incident to a C2 agency. 8.6.  Petroleum,  Oil,  and  Lubricants  (POL)  -  Aviation  Fuels  Documentation.  This  section prescribes  aviation  POL  (AVPOL)  procedures  that  ensure  correct  documentation,  form  and invoice processing, and program supervision.  Use the AIR Card for the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some military installations) worldwide.  The  AIR  Card  is  authorized  for  use  by  all  U.S.  government  aircraft,  state,  and  local  law enforcement  aircraft,  and  some  foreign  government  aircraft.      In  most  cases,  there  will  be  no changes when refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations.  The AIR  card is  accepted at  approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list  of all MSC-accepting merchants can be found at https://www.airseacard.com.  It replaces the SF 44 at locations that accept the AIR card. 8.6.1.  Responsibilities.  Aircrew  and  maintenance  personnel  will  be  familiar  with  AVPOL procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter.  Improper use of the MSC card could create financial liability for the purchaser. 8.6.2.  Refuel/defuel  USAF aircraft at  DoD locations  whenever possible.    If  DoD service is not available, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority: 8.6.2.1.  Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts. 8.6.2.2.  Open market AIR card purchase to include Shell International Trading Company (SITCO) agreement. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   35  Chapter 9 TRAINING AND OPERATING LIMITATIONS 9.1.  General.  This  chapter’s  purpose  is  to  establish  procedures  for  continuation  training, simulated  emergency  procedure  training,  and  area  work  training  that  may  be  accomplished  to include:  steep  turns,  traffic  pattern  stall  series,  alternate  gear  extension,  and  Vertical-S maneuvers. 9.2.  Area Work.  Military Operating Areas (MOA) for area work will be coordinated with unit scheduling.  Area work maneuvers will be conducted in VMC. 9.2.1.  Steep Turns.  Steep turns should be limited to 60° of bank during level flight. 9.2.2.  Traffic Pattern Stall Series. 9.2.2.1.  Pre-Series Checks: 9.2.2.1.1.  Accomplish traffic pattern stall series at an altitude between 5,000 ft AGL and 15,000 ft MSL.  The crew will obtain an altitude block for accomplishing traffic pattern  stalls.    Accomplish  the  “Descent  Checklist”  and  the  “Before  Landing Checklist.” 9.2.2.1.2.  Do not trim the aircraft at speeds below 100 KIAS. 9.2.2.2.  Stall Series.  Power settings to be used will be briefed prior to accomplishment. 9.2.2.3.  Post-Stall Series Checks.  Complete the “After Takeoff/Climb Checklist”. 9.2.3.  Alternate Gear Extension.  Follow the procedures in T.O. 1E-9A -1 for alternate gear extension training. 9.2.4.  Vertical-S.  Fly Vertical-S maneuvers in accordance with AFI 11-217 Volume 1. 9.3.  Practice  and  Simulated  Emergencies.  Practice/simulated  emergencies  will  not  be accomplished when there are passengers who are not on the AF IMT 4327 (Flight Authorization) (exception:  Mission  essential  personnel  (MEP)  listed  on  the  passenger  manifest).    Inform  the crew  of  simulated  emergency  procedure  (EP)  intentions  and  actions  before  commencing simulated  EPs.    Additionally,  notify  crew  once  simulated  EP  training  is  complete  and/or terminated. 9.4.  Single-Engine  Simulation.  The  following  procedures  will  be  used  when  simulating  an engine failure in flight. 9.4.1.  PF  will  disengage  the  autopilot.    Turn  off  synchrophase  and  set  condition  levers  to maximum (1200 RPM).  Retard the appropriate power lever to 15-20 percent torque. 9.4.2.  Accomplish the appropriate checklist.  (NOTE: The gear warning horn circuit breaker system will not be disabled). 9.4.3.  An  instructor  pilot  with  direct  access  to  flight  controls,  is  required  to  conduct simulated  single-engine  approaches,  simulated  single-engine  missed  approaches,  simulated single-engine touchdowns to a two-engine (normal) go, and simulated single-engine full stop landings  on  dry  runways.    Weather  must  be  1000  ft  and  2  miles  or  circling  minimums, whichever  is  higher  for  simulated  single-engine  operations.    This  restriction  does  not   36  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 preclude initiating simulated single engine training while in IMC above 1000 ft and 2 miles or circling minimums, whichever is higher. 9.4.4.  During  a  simulated  single-engine  approach,  if  an  unplanned  go-around  or  missed approach  is  executed,  both  power  levers  will  be  used.    Again,  planned  simulated  single-engine  missed  approaches  are  permitted  but  will  be  thoroughly  briefed  prior  to  the  missed approach. 9.4.5.  Simulated  loss  of  an  engine  immediately  after  takeoff  may  be  performed  under  the following conditions: 9.4.5.1.  With an IP occupying either seat. 9.4.5.2.  After reaching at least 300 feet AGL on takeoff. 9.4.5.3.  Day only, 1,000 ft and 2 miles or circling minimums, whichever is higher. 9.4.5.4.  When  airspeed  is  above  minimum  control  speed  or  computed  takeoff  speed, whichever is higher. 9.4.6.  At no time will more than one of the aircraft’s engines be simulated out.   Simulated single-engine  missed  approaches  will  be  initiated  above  300  feet  AGL  to  ensure  that  the aircraft  will  not  descend  below  300  feet  AGL  throughout  the  maneuver.    If  the  aircraft descends below 300 feet AGL for a planned full stop or touch-and-go landing and a missed approach is necessary, the missed approach will be accomplished using both engines. 9.5.  Practice  Emergency  Descents.  Practice  emergency  descents  will  be  completed  clear  of clouds and before reaching 5,000 feet AGL or the established MOCA, whichever is higher. 9.6.  Touch-and-Go/Stop-and-Go  Weather  Minimums.  Normal  touch-and-go/stop-and-go landings will not be accomplished unless the actual weather conditions are at or above published approach  minimums  for  the  approach  being  flown  (minimum  2,400  RVR)  and  useable  runway length is at least 6,000 ft. 9.7.  Practice No-Flap Landings.  Practice no-flap landings will not be accomplished in the E-9A aircraft. 9.8.  Divert Instructions.  Refer to 53 WEG/WSEP Pilot Aid for divert data. 9.9.  Operating Limitations. 9.9.1.  Unless  specifically  authorized  elsewhere  in  this  section,  do  not  practice  emergency procedures  that  degrade  aircraft  performance  or  flight  control  capabilities  (in-flight).    In  an actual emergency, terminate all training and flight maneuver practicing. Training should only be resumed when the PIC determines it is safe. 9.9.2.  Option  Approach  and  Visual  Low  Approaches.    Initiate  a  planned  missed  approach according to the limitations in Table 9.1 9.9.3.  Aircrews  will  only  perform  engine-out  approaches  and  landings  during  daytime  and clear of clouds with a discernible horizon present. 9.9.4.  Other simulated emergency approaches will be limited to non-critical phases of flight and will be kept to a minimum when IMC or at night. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   37  Table 9.1.

This  chapter  provides  general  E-9A  fuel  planning  considerations  and procedures.  Missions  should  be  planned  at  altitudes,  routes,  and  airspeeds  to  minimize  fuel usage. Publish local procedures in unit supplements to this AFI. 10.2.  Fuel  Conservation.  It  is  Air  Force  policy  to  conserve  aviation  fuel  when  it  does  not adversely  affect  training,  flight  safety,  or  operational  readiness.    Aircrew  will  manage  aviation fuel  as  a  limited  commodity  and  precious  resource.    Fuel  optimization  will  be  considered throughout all phases of mission planning and execution.  Comply with the following whenever consistent with technical order guidance and safety: 10.2.1.  Fuel  Loads.  Excessive  ramp  and  recovery  fuel  adds  to  aircraft  gross  weight  and increases fuel  consumption.  Standard ramp  fuel  loads will be used  for local  missions.  Do not  ferry  extra  fuel  beyond  optimum  requirements  for  safe  mission  accomplishment  and training objectives. 10.2.2.  Flight Planning.  Aircrew and mission planners will optimize flight plans and flight routing for fuel efficiency. 10.2.3.  Center-of-Gravity (CG).  Load and maintain aircraft within CG limits consistent with Flight Manual restrictions. 10.2.4.  Departure Planning.  Consider use of opposite direction runway to reduce taxi and/or expedite departure routing if winds allow. 10.2.5.  Takeoff.  Rolling takeoffs will normally be used for takeoff.  Consider using reduced power  when  able  if  conditions  permit.    This  saves  fuel  and  engine  wear.    Clean  up  on schedule and don‘t delay gear and flap retraction. 10.2.6.  Climb/Descent.    In-flight  procedures  such  as  climb/descent  profiles  and  power settings should also be considered for efficient fuel usage. 10.2.7.  Weather  Deviations.    Attempt  to  coordinate  for  off-course  deviation  early  so  gross maneuvering is not required. 10.2.8.  Cruise techniques.  Attempt to trim the aircraft and match throttle settings whenever possible.  Fly fuel efficient speeds and altitudes to the maximum extent possible. 10.2.9.  Approach.    Fly  most  direct  routing  to  arrival  approach  consistent  with  mission requirements. 10.2.10.  Holding.    If  holding  is  required,  hold  clean  at  the  most  fuel  efficient  altitude  and request  a  large  holding  pattern.    Hold  at  endurance  or  performance  manual  recommended holding speeds, conditions permitting. 10.2.11.  Parking.  Consider using shortest taxi route when able. 10.3.  Fuel  Planning  Procedures.  Aircrew  should  employ  the  following  aviation  fuel optimization  measures  without  compromising  flight  safety  or  jeopardizing  mission/training accomplishment: AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   39  10.3.1.  Plan  a  45-minute  fuel  reserve  at  destination  or  alternate  (when  an  alternate  is required). 10.3.2.  Plan fuel to an alternate only when AFI 11-202V3 and/or this document require the filing of an alternate. 10.3.2.1.  When  only  one  alternate  is  required,  use  the  closest  suitable  airfield  meeting mission requirement and 11-202V3 weather criteria. 10.3.2.2.  If two alternates are required, use the two closest suitable airfields meeting 11-202V3 weather criteria and fuel plan to the more distant of the two. 10.3.2.3.  When  selecting  an  alternate,  suitable  military  airfields  are  preferred,  but  not required. 10.3.2.4.  The practice of selecting an alternate in another weather system or selecting an alternate based on maintenance capability will not be used. 10.3.2.5.  For remote destinations, holding is authorized in lieu of an alternate airport.  In such  situations,  use  2+00  hrs  reserve  fuel  (1+00  holding  in  lieu  of  an  alternate,  0+45 reserve, 0+15 contingency). 10.3.2.6.  Alternate  selection  is  ultimately  the  Aircraft  Commander‘s  responsibility  and should  include  multiple  factors  including  landing  fees,  diplomatic  relationships  and availability of contract gas.  Fuel savings should not compromise mission effectiveness. 10.3.3.  For  all  missions  calculate  an  additional  15  minutes  of  contingency  fuel  to compensate  for  unforeseen  circumstances  during  any  phase  of  flight  (i.e.  unforecasted weather, launch delay, etc).  Contingency fuel will not be considered reserve fuel since crews may  burn  some  or  all  of  their  contingency  fuel  at  any  time  during  the  mission.  Compute using planned destination gross weight at 10,000 feet. 10.3.3.1.  Reserve  and  contingency  fuel  will  be  computed  using  consumption  rates providing  maximum  endurance  at  10,000  feet  MSL  at  destination  gross  weight.    If  an alternate  is  required,  compute  using  weight  at  alternate  destination.  When  computing reserve  and  contingency  fuel  for  remote  destinations,  use  consumption  rates  providing maximum  endurance  at  20,000  feet  MSL.    If  an  alternate  is  required,  compute  using weight at the alternate destination. 10.3.4.  Using all available planning tools and guidance in this chapter, PICs will determine the required ramp fuel load (RRFL) to complete mission to the final destination when away from home station. 10.4.  Fuel  Requirements.  This  paragraph  implements  standard  minimum  fuel  requirements. Comply with AFI 11-202V3/ACC Sup 1 and local guidance, if applicable. 10.4.1.  Required  ramp  fuel  will  consist  of  all  fuel  required  for  engine  start,  taxi,  takeoff, climb, cruise, alternate/missed approach (if required), descent, approach, transition, landing, and  fuel  reserve  (holding  fuel).    Plan  fuel  load  using  computer  flight  plan  or  AF  Form  70, Flight  Plan,  Table  10.1,  and  the  flight  manual  (fuel  plan  not  required  on  local  training missions remaining within 100 NM). 10.5.  Alternate  Fuel.  Fuel  for  flight  from  intended  destination  to  alternate  aerodrome  at optimum altitude and normal cruise speed.  Compute fuel, time, and altitude from T.O. 1E-9A-1.   40  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 When  holding  is  required  in  lieu  of  an  alternate  at  a  remote  or  island  destination,  compute holding  for  2+00  hours  using  planned  destination  gross  weight  at  FL200.    This  provides  1+15 minutes  holding  fuel  in  addition  to  the  45  minute  reserve  requirement.    A  remote  or  island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which, due to its unique geographic location, offers no suitable  alternate  (civil  or  military).    The  forecast  weather  at  the  remote  or  island  destination must meet the criteria listed in Chapter 6.  NOTE: Plan initial arrival overhead destination with fuel  for holding plus  approach and landing or 800 pounds, whichever is  greater.   If destination has  two  operational  and  suitable  runways  for  landing,  plan  initial  arrival  overhead  destination with fuel for holding plus approach and landing or 600 pounds, whichever is greater.  Additional fuel  may be added to  allow crews some  flexibility  when dealing with  unplanned contingencies (e.g. weather avoidance, ATC delays, etc).  When dealing with unplanned contingencies, crews will still plan to touchdown with fuel reserve (minimum).  Unit may develop standard alternate fuel  requirements for local  training missions; however, these fuel  requirements will not  be less than those specified in this chapter. Table 10.1.

When holding in lieu of alternate is required (paragraph 6.37.) use 1+15 holding fuel computed at 20,000 feet  200 pounds  Fuel for planned holding when delays are anticipated  NOTES:  (1) Include all planned off-course maneuvering for departure or en route deviations.  (2) When two alternates are required, compute fuel from the destination to the most distant alternate only.  (3) Minimum fuel required over destination or alternate is fuel for holding plus approach and landing or 1,000 pounds, whichever is greater.  (4) Compliance with this chart ensures fuel reserve requirements in AFI11-202V3.  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   41  10.6.  Minimum  Fuel.  Minimum  fuel  is  400  pounds.    Crews  should  plan  to  terminate  all missions  with  not  less  than  400  pounds  (when  required  holding  is  1+15  crews  should  plan  to land  with  approximately  800-1000  lbs).    When  operating  in  FAA  airspace,  pilots  will  declare minimum  fuel  to  the  controlling  agency  when  in  their  judgment  the  aircraft  may  land  at  the intended destination with less than these amounts. 10.7.  Emergency  Fuel.  Emergency  fuel  is  260  pounds.    Crews  will  declare  an  emergency whenever it is determined that they will land with emergency fuel or less.   42  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 Chapter 11 AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES 11.1.  General.  This  chapter  contains  aircrew  procedures  not  contained  in  the  flight  manual, other portions of this AFI, or other publications. 11.2.  Responsibilities.  Aircrew  may  assist  the  normal  maintenance  function  when  critical contingency tasking dictate their use, provided this action does not  impact  crew  duty  and crew rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI. 11.3.  Authority  to  Clear  a  Red  X.  Pilots  are  not  normally  authorized  to  clear  a  Red  X.  If  a situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are not  available  to  clear  it, the  PIC  may  obtain  authorization  to  clear  the  Red  X  from  the  owning MX Program Manager or OG/CC. Other crew members are not authorized to clear a Red X. 11.4.  Aircraft  Servicing.  Aircrew  are  normally  not  required  to  service  the  aircraft;  however, they  are  qualified  and  authorized  to  perform  those  aircrew  maintenance  support  tasks  found  in this  volume.    The  aircrew  performs  these  tasks  only  in  the  absence  of  qualified  maintenance personnel.  This exception is designed for support of the aircraft and its mission while away from home station.  Without exception, the applicable checklists will be used during all refueling and de-fueling operations. 11.4.1.  Aircraft  Refueling.    Aircrew  members  qualified  in  ground  refueling  may  perform refueling duties. Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed. 11.4.1.1.  When crewmembers are required to refuel, a pilot will act as the refueling team supervisor.    Pilots  acting  as  refueling  supervisors  and  panel  operators  will  comply  with T.O.  00-25-172,  Ground  Servicing  Of  Aircraft  And  Static  Grounding/Bonding  (ATOS), and applicable E-9A series T.O.s. 11.4.1.2.  Concurrent  Ground  Operations.    Concurrent  servicing  ground  operations  are not authorized. 11.4.2.  The following guidance will be used for fuel servicing (refuel) operations only: 11.4.2.1.  Electric  and  electronic  equipment  may  be  left  on  provided  it  does  not  radiate energy; but it must not be turned on or off during refueling. 11.4.2.2.  TACANs must be turned off. 11.4.2.3.  Radar may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned off. 11.4.2.4.  IFF may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned off. 11.4.2.5.  FMS  may  be  on  and  may  be  updated.  Do  not  turn  on  or  off  during  refuel operations. 11.4.2.6.  A ground power unit (GPU) may be used to supply aircraft electrical power. 11.4.3.  Fire Protection and Crash Rescue. 11.4.3.1.  A  fire  bottle,  if  available,  should  be  positioned  near  the  front  of  the  aircraft prior to starting engines. AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015   43  11.4.4.  Aircrew and Maintenance Engine Runs. 11.4.4.1.  A mixture of aircrew and maintenance personnel will not normally accomplish engine  runs.    When  an  aircrew  member  is  required  to  start  or  run  up  engines  for maintenance purposes, the following procedures apply: 11.4.4.1.1.  Coordinate  engine  run  with  scheduling  and  engine  run  objectives  with maintenance. 11.4.4.1.2.  Accomplish  aircraft  interior  and  exterior  checklists,  engine  start  and before taxi, taxi (if required), and engine shutdown checklists. 11.4.4.1.3.  If taxi is required, coordinate with ground controllers or tower controllers as appropriate. 11.4.4.1.4.  Maintenance  personnel  will  accomplish  all  necessary  inspections  and preparations  for  the  engine  run.    These  actions  include  but  are  not  limited  to: intake/exhaust  inspections,  access  panel  security  servicing,  and  AFTO  Form  781 documentation. 11.5.  Aircraft  Recovery  Away  from  Main  Operating  Base  (MOB).  The  PIC  is  responsible for ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings.  If qualified maintenance specialists are unavailable, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet subsequent mission taskings. 11.5.1.  The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including: 11.5.1.1.  Taxi, parking and mission tasking coordination with C2. 11.5.1.2.  Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage. 11.5.1.3.  Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability. 11.5.1.4.  Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking. 11.5.1.5.  Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest. 11.5.1.6.  Coordinating aircraft security requirements. 11.5.1.7.  Documenting AFTO 781-series forms. 11.5.2.  In  all  cases  where  aircrews  must  service  the  aircraft  without  qualified  maintenance specialist assistance, comply with the appropriate maintenance T.O. 11.5.3.  Aircrews are not qualified to  accomplish the required  ground inspections.   In those instances  where  maintenance  personnel  are  not  available,  the  aircrew  will  enter  a  red  dash symbol  in  the  AFTO  Form  781H,  Aerospace  Vehicle  Flight  Status  and  Maintenance Document,  updating  current  status  and  enter  a  red  dash  symbol  and  a  discrepancy  that reflects  that  the  applicable  maintenance  inspection  (i.e.  preflight,  thru-flight,  basic  post-flight) is overdue.   44  AFI11-2E-9V3  15 MAY 2015 Chapter 12 CARGO AND PASSENGER PROCEDURES 12.1.  General.  A  pilot  coordinates  passenger  and  cargo  loading  with  C2  agency  and/or  unit schedulers. 12.2.  Responsibilities for Aircraft Passenger Loading.  A passenger manifest will be provided to  the  PIC  to  verify  passengers  on  board  for  mission.    The  PIC  or  a  designated  representative qualified  in  egress  procedures  training  will  brief  passengers  on  emergency  actions  and  other pertinent passenger information. See Attachment 2 for Passenger Briefing Guide. 12.3.  Responsibilities  for  Aircraft  Cargo  Loading.  The  pilot  is  responsible  for  aircraft preflight, load planning (as required) of all cargo, preparing takeoff and landing data, weight and balance criteria, properly operating aircraft equipment, tiedown of cargo, and checking the cargo against  manifests.    The  pilot  supervises  and  directs  on/offloading  and  is  responsible  for  safe movement of cargo into and out of the aircraft. 12.4.  Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles.  No part of the cargo load will extend into the aisle, so as not to obstruct the aisle in case of evacuation.  TOD D.
