SUMMARY OF CHANGES The  OPR  for  this  document  has  changed  from  HQ  ACC/A3CS  to  HQ  ACC/A3J.    Chapter  1 should be read in  its entirety  as this chapter has  been thoroughly re-written.  Additionally, this revised  document  has  changed  from  an  “ACCI”  to  an  “AFI”  due  to  the  fact  that  a  MAJCOM Instruction cannot provide direction to another MAJCOM. AFI10-3002  3 MARCH 2016 3 Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1.  Background.  Friendly  Force  Tracking  (FFT),  formerly  known  as  Blue  Force  Tracking (BFT) describes Department of Defense programs that provide systems for locating, tracking and determining the status of friendly (US, allied, coalition) forces. BFT as an all-encompassing term has been replaced in joint publications and instructions with Friendly Force Tracking. FFT takes precedence  over  BFT  due  to  its  consistency  with  joint  operations  guidance  and  policy  as specified in CJCSI 3910.01B. Specifically, FFT is defined in Joint Pub 1-02 as “the process of fixing, observing, and reporting the location and movement of friendly forces.” The FFT-family of space-based and terrestrial systems is employed to generate, collect and disseminate or share friendly  force  identification,  location  and  tracking  information.  For  the  purpose  of  this instruction,  the  term  FFT  will  be  used  except  where  BFT  is  appropriate  (i.e.,  document  titles, policies, etc). When discussing  FFT, be aware that BFT is  prevalent in  various documents  and that other Services and agencies may still use the term BFT interchangeably with FFT (e.g. there are also specific FFT devices which have Blue Force Tracker in their name). 1.1.1.  Friendly  Force  Tracking  systems  use  the  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  to calculate their current position, velocity and time and then transmit their position via space-based,  airborne  and  ground-based  receivers  to  other  FFT  users  and  Command  and  Control (C2) Centers on  a Common  Operating Picture  (COP). Fielded forces and C2 nodes  receive FFT  data  via  one  or  more  communication  links  such  as  satellite  communications (SATCOM),  classified networks (e.g. Secret  Internet Protocol Router (SIPRNET)), or Non-Classified  Internet  Protocol  Router  (NIPRNET)  when  in  CONUS  which  is  then  displayed through a Tactical Display Processor (TDP), such as C2PC (Command and Control Personal Computer), or situational awareness software tools. 1.1.2.  In addition to the position location information (PLI), some FFT devices can transmit brevity  codes  or  free  text/canned  messages  to  communicate  limited  status  and  intention. Units  use  FFT  capabilities  for  building  their  situational  awareness  (SA)  in  order  to  aid  C2 efforts,  assist  in  the  prevention  of  fratricide  and  to  support  execution  of  traditional  or  non-traditional PR missions. FFT devices are not intended to provide the fidelity required for use as  a  friendly  force  deconfliction  tool  for  airspace  control  and  joint  fires  C2.  FFT  devices should not  be used in  this  capacity  -- standard Airspace Control Measures (ACM) and Fire Support Control Measures (FSCM) should be used for friendly force deconfliction. 1.1.3.  PR forces currently use several different FFT devices; one for flying platforms (HH-60  &  C-130  variants)  and  the  other  for  GA  (Guardian  Angel)  units  that  have  PJ’-s (Pararescue Jumper) and CRO’-s (Combat Rescue Officer). 1.1.4.  IAW  AFI  90-201,  The  Air  Force  Inspection  System,  PR  units  will  participate  in  the Inspector  General’s  Reporting  System  utilizing  the  Management  Internal  Control  Toolset (MICT) (T-2). 1.2.  Objective.  To identify procedures for effectively managing a FFT system within the USAF PR community.  Due to  the sensitive nature of FFT technology, and the  potential danger to  all Service  personnel  should  sensitive  FFT  information  be  compromised,  personnel  must  protect FFT  devices  and  information.  This  instruction  provides  guidance  to  forces  issued  FFT  devices 4 AFI10-3002  3 MARCH 2016 from  ACC, including PACAF, USAFE, ANG,  and AFRC PR forces.  It  also  provides guidance on  the  management  of  FFT  device  distribution,  information  data  dissemination,  operational considerations  as  well  as  inventory,  tracking  and  accounting  procedures.  Finally,  current  PR CAF approved devices are authorized for use OCONUS. 1.3.  ACC  Personnel  Recovery  (PR)  Division  (ACC/A3J)  Approval  of  FFT  Devices.  PR units will notify ACC/A3J of all devices used for FFT purposes. Prior to initial FFT device use, units  must  coordinate  with  ACC/A3J  to  ensure  emerging  FFT  technologies  are  supported  by operational  requirements,  undergo  appropriate  operational  and  systems  testing,  are  integrated into  the  Mission  Management  Center  (MMC)  data  base,  and  approved  for  use  in  aircraft  as warranted  by  established  requirements  (T-2).  ACC/A3J  ensures  FFT  device  standardization, utilization  and  architecture  integration  are  in  compliance  with  current  security  and  operating guidance (i.e. CJCSI 3910.01B, Enclosure C, FFT Security and Classification Policy). 1.3.1.  When additional  or new FFT devices are  authorized for employment,  ACC/A3J will provide and distribute command guidance identifying the approved FFT devices along with operational  guidance  for  integrating  the  FFT  technology  and  information  into  the  existing FFT architecture.  FFT is an integral part of PR operations. 1.3.2.  All  FFT  challenges    relating    operational    requirements,    device    management,  training,  architecture  integration  of  FFT  equipment  and  technologies  must  be  coordinated through, and approved by ACC/A3J. Likewise, all functions relating to plans, programs, and requirements, to include aircraft integration, funding and contracts, will also be coordinated through ACC/A3J to ensure proper FFT management. 1.3.3.  Units will not use devices for FFT that are not ACC approved.  Devices not approved for ACC FFT employment will not be used to transmit PLI for FFT purposes. 1.3.4.  All  requests  to  recommend  a  device  for  consideration  and  inclusion  as  an  approved FFT device will be submitted through  ACC/A3J via the AF  Form 1067 process. Units will not  unilaterally  sponsor  or  support  unapproved  devices  for  FFT  utilization,  to  include sponsoring  device  production,  procurement,  and  integration  in  the  FFT  architecture  or Common  Operating  Picture  (COP)  via  Defense  Information  System  Agency  (DISA), Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  Agencies  (to  include  the  Army  Strategic  Command  and MMC), or Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Tech Center. 1.3.5.  Units requiring additional  or  replacement  FFT  devices  will  contact  ACC/A3J  for acquiring    FFT    devices.    If  approved,  ACC/A3J  will  facilitate  requisition  of  additional  or replacement FFT devices, or sponsor the purchase request  with  the appropriate government controlling  authority  that  must  authorize  the  transaction  prior  to  the  purchase  of  the  FFT device. 1.3.6.  All  FFT  devices  will  be  registered  with  the  MMC,  Data  Dissemination  Center,  for friendly  force  tracking/common  operating  picture  management  prior  to  the  device  being issued  for  use.  Iridium  satellite  or  other  commercially  procured  devices  also  have  to  be registered  through  the  DISA  in  order  to  connect  to  the  Iridium  satellite  or  other  relevant constellation  and  for  use  on  the  DoD  Enhanced  Mobile  Satellite  Service  (EMSS)  gateway. DISA,  through  the  Defense  Information  Systems  Network  (DISN)  EMSS,  contracts  with commercial  providers  on  registration  and  airtime  usage  fees  for  the  DoD.  Currently,  DISA has established centralized billing at the Service/Agency level for EMSS/Distributed Tactical AFI10-3002  3 MARCH 2016 5 Communications  System  (DTCS)  services  where  customers  have  unlimited  airtime  on  an unlimited number of devices. DTCS is also known as “Netted Iridium.” Registration of FFT devices with the MMC, DISA, and NSWC Crane is facilitated through ACC/A3J. Although units do not pay for monthly satellite airtime usage they are still responsible for paying the one- time device activation fee and any sustainment costs. 1.3.7.  FFT  devices  are  assigned  to  specific  PR  units.    Once  a  FFT  device  is  installed  on  a flying  platform,  the  device  may  be  moved  or  transferred  to  another  aircraft  with  the  same unit. However, devices will not be moved to another unit except under critical situations to support  operational  requirements  or  at  an  exercise  event  such  as  Red  Flag  where  there  are devices  available  for  units  to  borrow.  As  for  other  type  training  activities  or  events  for Security Forces Squadron (SFS) or TACP (Tactical Air Control Party), refer to the functional that  controls  their  equipment/device  use.  If  a  device  must  be  moved,  the  unit  POC  will immediately coordinate the change through ACC/A3J or its designated representatives such as NSWC Crane Tech Center and the MMC using SIPRNET e-mail and secure phone. This process ensures COP accuracy, C2 architectural management and FFT control/accountability. FFT devices are US only and are not to be given or loaned out to non-US personnel. 6 AFI10-3002  3 MARCH 2016 Chapter 2 DEVICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND SECURITY PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  General.  Some  FFT  devices  utilize  highly  sensitive  technologies  and  contain  encryption keys.   The  following  paragraphs  outline  FFT  device  accountability  requirements  and responsibilities.  FFT devices must be stored in a physically controlled area and accounted for in storage as “sensitive items.” 2.1.1.  Units  interested  in  obtaining  additional/replacement  FFT  devices  should  contact ACC/A3J for guidance through their Wing/Group FFT Point of Contact (POC). 2.1.2.  Shipping  (T-0).    The  only  approved  carries  for  FFT  devices  are  Federal  Express®, DHL, or official pouch service. Ensure that only approved carriers or official pouch service are  used  for  shipping  FFT  devices.    Contact  the  unit  security  office  for  the  latest  list  of approved  carriers.  When  shipping  devices  within  the  continental  United  States  (CONUS) they will be sent next day as a minimum. They should be shipped Monday through Thursday and not on Friday. Senders will always call the receiving end on the day the shipment is due to  verify  receipt.  If  the  device  is  going  outside  of  the  CONUS,  these  CONUS  precautions apply with the added constraint of extended shipping times. If at all possible, ship devices via official pouch system. If the device is going to or coming from an overseas remote location where  an  approved  carrier  or  official  pouch  services  are  not  available,  it  must  be  hand-carried. 2.2.  FFT Device Accountability. 2.2.1.  Since PR FFT devices are an accountable, equipment item, units will track devices on their Custodian Authorization / Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) (T-2). This equipment is not tied to any UTC, but may be put on a mobility account. The authorized quantity of FFT devices on-hand is based on individual unit mission requirements and A3J approval. 2.2.2.  Mobile  Satellite  Service  (MSS)  devices  will  also  be  accounted  for  on  the  unit’s CA/CRL to ensure control and accountability of the radios (T-2). Additionally, owning units are  required  to  load  new  FFT  devices  into  the  Air  Force  Equipment  Management  System (AFEMS) for accountability. ACC A6/A6CS tracks FFT MSS devices through AFEMS and conducts an annual MSS Data Call and an inventory of MSS equipment during the month of June each year. 2.2.3.  Units will inventory FFT devices yearly and notify ACC/A3J that the unit’s CA/CRL account has been verified by 30 August each year. The unit equipment custodian or squadron representative  with  knowledge  of  FFT  devices  will  notify  ACC/A3J  via  e-mail  with  the current list (serial numbers) and type of device(s) in the unit (T-2). 2.2.4.  Units  will  not  transfer  or  loan  FFT  devices  to  other  PR  units  without  prior coordination  from  ACC/A3J.    Permanent  transfers  and  loans  to  other  PR  units  will  follow accountability guidance in AFMAN 23-110, “USAF Supply Manual”, Volume 2, Part 13 (T-2). 2.3.  Responsibilities and Tasks for Device Control. 2.3.1.  HQ ACC/A3J will: AFI10-3002  3 MARCH 2016 7 2.3.1.1.

The  database  will  include:  programming  information associated  with  each  FFT  device,  unit  issued  the  FFT,  its  current  location,  and  other information as needed. The database will provide the MAJCOM and unit FFT managers with  crucial  information  on  ACC’s  FFT  devices.  Reporting  information  from  the  field will be managed in accordance with report control symbol (RCS): ACC/A3J (AR) 0801, BLUE FORCE Device Tracking. 2.3.1.2.  Facilitate FFT training and instruction materials to units when devices are issued and  on  an  as  needed  basis  thereafter.  Provide  guidance  to  NSWC  Crane  Tech  Center which will be incorporated into NSWC Crane training and fielding documents for units. 2.3.1.3.  Report compromised, missing or destroyed FFTs to the MMC and NSWC Crane Tech Center (for SHOUT devices). 2.3.1.4.  Act  as  the  command’s  OPR  for  PR  FFT  device  control,  accounting,  and reporting procedures. 2.3.1.5.  Act as the command’s OPR for requests for new or replacement FFT devices. 2.3.1.6.  Coordinate  with  ACC/A5R  for  any  request  ACC/A3J  receives  for  FFT installations on ACC personnel recovery aircraft (C-130 variants or HH-60). 2.3.1.7.  Maintain a record of device transfers between units. 2.3.1.8.  Provide  units  information  on  the  process  to  repair  malfunctioning  or  failed  FFT equipment and coordinate replacement if needed. 2.3.1.9.  Act as liaison to the National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO), MMC, and NSWC Crane Tech Center for all PR units. 2.3.2.  HQ ACC/A5R will: 2.3.2.1.  Coordinate  and  manage  all  installations  of  new  or  replacement  Kit-As  for  FFT devices on personnel recovery aircraft (C-130 variants and HH-60). 2.3.2.2.  Forward  all  information  regarding  installation  or  removal  of  FFT  T-1 modifications  on  personnel  recovery  aircraft  (C-130  variants  and  HH-60)  which  will include unit, type aircraft, and tail number to ACC/A3J. 2.3.3.  Units  at  home  station  in  coordination  with  their  Wing/Group  FFT  POC  will  (Note: deployed units will work through their home station): 2.3.3.1.  Appoint  a  FFT  primary  and  alternate  POC  via  memorandum  to  ACC/A3J  via NIPRNET  e-mail.  (T-2).  FFT  POCs  must  have  a  SIPRNET  account  and  access  to  a secure phone. 2.3.3.2.  Maintain  accountability  of  their  FFT  devices  on  a  CA/CRL  (i.e.  MTX  and Iridium devices). 2.3.3.3.  Report  inoperative,  malfunctioning,  missing  or  destroyed  FFT  devices  to ACC/A3J via SIPRNET e-mail within two duty days (T-2). 2.3.3.4.  Report compromise of FFT devices via SIPRNET e-mail to the MMC or NSWC Crane Tech Center and inform ACC/A3J within 24 hours (T-2). 8 AFI10-3002  3 MARCH 2016 2.3.3.5.  Notify ACC/A3J when FFT devices are involved in mishaps or suspected to be involved in mishaps. Notification must occur within two duty days of the mishap. Make every effort to recover FFT devices involved in mishaps. Provide NRO/TASC recovered FFT  devices  or  destruction  notification  if  devices  are  destroyed  and  notify  ACC/A3J. Destruction  notification  must  occur  within  two  duty  days  of  determination  that  the devices are destroyed. 2.3.3.6.  Maintain  FFT  devices  in  good  repair  IAW  that  specific  device  Manual,  and return  inoperative  or  malfunctioning  devices  to  TASC  (The  Analytic  Sciences Corporation)  for  evaluation  and  repair  using  unit  funds.  Units  will  coordinate  with ACC/A3J  prior  to  shipping  devices  to  ensure  up-to-date  shipping  instructions,  TASC POCs  and  appropriate  mailing  address.  Units  may  use  the  Government  Wide  Purchase Card  (GPC)  if  the  cost  falls  within  allowable  limits.  Overseas  shipments  require additional  shipping  documentation  IAW  the  International  Traffic  Arms  Regulation (ITAR). Iridium devices will be shipped to NSWC Crane Tech Center accordingly. 2.3.3.7.  Report all aircraft T-1 FFT Kit modifications to ACC/A5R. 2.3.3.8.  Designate  unit  FFT  POC  via  Memorandum  for  ACC/A3J  including  24  hour emergency/911  contact  info  (T-2).  Currently,  the  theater  Joint  Personnel  Recovery Centers  are  the  focal  point  for  the  MMC  to  contact  in  the  event  of  a  “911”  activation. Units may want to designate their command post or similar function within their unit as the secondary 24 hour contact point. 2.3.3.9.  Notify ACC/A3J when FFT devices are being deployed to a theater of operations (T-2).  One  week  prior  to  deployment,  notify  ACC/A3J  via  SIPRNET  e-mail  of  the following: unit, serial #s to be deployed, location of deployment and/or geographic area of  operations,  time-  frame  expected  for  deployment  and  mission  design  series  type. Subsequently,  upon  redeployment  to  the  home  base,  notify  ACC/A3J  of  the  same information. 2.3.3.10.  Install FFT devices as a T-1 aircraft modification only as tested and approved by the System Program Office (SPO) (T-2). 2.3.3.11.  Contact  ACC/A3J  before  contacting  the  NRO,  MMC,  or  NSWC  Crane  Tech Center. 2.3.3.12.  Refer to Attachment 2 for a snapshot of reporting events and timelines. 2.4.  Exercises and Training. 2.4.1.  For  exercises  and  tests  where  the  user  is  directed  to  use  a  different  frequency  other than the one to  which their FFT devices  are programmed (e.g. DESERT  RESCUE, JFEXs, etc), the user must contact ACC/A3J (via SIPRNET message) a minimum of 1 month prior to the  exercise  with  the  following  information.  ACC/A3J  will  build  a  file  to  reprogram  the device  and  forward  it  to  the  unit(s)  requiring  the  change  (T-2).  The  SIPRNET  message request must state the following: 2.4.1.1.  Device serial numbers requiring change. 2.4.1.2.  Operation supported/Theater where devices will be operated. 2.4.1.3.  Geographic coverage requirements. AFI10-3002  3 MARCH 2016 9 2.4.1.4.  Dates and time periods for coverage. 2.4.1.5.  POC. 2.4.2.  Local  Training:  Users  may  use  their  FFTs  and  other  approved  devices  during  local training  for  familiarization.  To  initiate  support,  send  a  SIPR  e-mail  to  A3JT  at (acca3jt.jid@langley.af.smil.mil) at usarmy.peterson.smdc.mbx.mmc@mail.smil.mil  approximately1  month  prior  to  training event.  A3JT  or  MMC  will  collect  information  from  the  user  to  complete  and  submit  a Consolidated  Exercise  Support  Request  (CESR)  to  make  required  timing  for  submission prior to the actual event or training. Under no circumstances will the FFT “911” call be used unless in an actual emergency. MMC or 2.5.  Contact Information. 2.5.1.  ACC/A3CS SIPRNET Web Page: (http://www/acc/af/smil.mil/a3/a3c). 2.5.2.

Classification of FFT Information. 3.1.1.  Some  devices  used  by  units  are  unclassified  but  contain  sensitive  technology.  Association  of  device  serial  numbers  with  a  PR  squadron  designation  is  unclassified. However, certain information associated with FFT devices and the means by which unit’s use them  may  be  classified  for  operations  security  (OPSEC).  Classification  during  training  and exercises  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  security  classification  guidance  of  the  training  or exercise. Classification for contingency operations will be in accordance with the Combatant Commander’s  OPSEC  guidance.  If  OPSEC  guidance  is  not  provided,  or  unless  otherwise specified,  units  will  follow  the  guidance  in  Table  3.1.  Additionally,  Iridium  devices  are controlled by United States export laws and regulations. Table 3.1.  FFT Device Information Contingency Classification Guidance. Element Associated with Classification Device  Serial Number  Specific location plus the fact that a “911” Secret* brevity code has been transmitted Device  Serial Number  Operational mission brevity code cross-matrix Secret* * Derived from Combatant Commander OPSEC guidance. (brevity code meaning) 3.1.2.  If operating with USSOCOM/AFSOC units, adhere to their classification policies (see the USSOCOM SCG, the COBRA SCG, and CJCSI 3910.01B Enclosure C on Classification of FFT Information). 3.1.3.  Certain  technical  information  associated  with  the  architecture  used  to  support  some FFT  devices  is  classified.  For  PR  flying  platform  FFT  devices,  refer  to  COBRA  Security Classification Guide, found on the ACC/A3J SIPRNET website and the MMC website. For other FFT devices, i.e. Iridium devices refer to the appropriate security classification guide. 3.1.4.  Only ACC/A3J can authorize PT units to change device programming.  Unauthorized changes  could  cause  data  from  other  devices  not  to  be  received  properly  from  the  national architecture (T-2). This could cause serious damage to the units involved. 3.2.  Naming Convention Requirements. 3.2.1.  The  MMC  in  Colorado  Springs  is  responsible  for  associating  track  names  and attributes  with  device  serial/IMEI  numbers.  These  track  names  and  attributes  are  used  to “build  the  track”  that  subsequently  appears  in  approved  COP  systems.  Various  FFT  using organizations coordinate naming conventions with the MMC to ensure that the track data is displayed  in  a  consistent  and  understandable  format  for  each  user.  When  users  do  not  pass naming information to the MMC, FFT track data will be seen as unknown or incorrect tracks, which significantly reduces the usefulness of the data. AFI10-3002  3 MARCH 2016 11 3.2.2.  For  those  PR  units  using  standardized  naming  conventions  for  global  operations,  an example of MTX naming convention is  shown in  Attachment  3. ACC/A3J will  coordinate with the MMC to ensure that all MTXs are displayed with these naming conventions. Theater FFT managers must inform  ACC/A3J through  the home station FFT POC via SIPRNET e-mail  of  any  changes  made  to  the  naming  conventions  for  FFT  devices  in  their  area  of responsibility  within  two  duty  days  of  coordinating  the  change  with  the  MMC.  This  is because  ACC/A3JT  maintains  a  database  that  must  match  the  MMC  records.
