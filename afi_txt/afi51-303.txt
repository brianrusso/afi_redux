An employee may bring suit against theUnited States in the United States Court of Federal Claims under 28 U.S.C. ß1498(a) or (b) for patent orcopyright infringement, except where:3.1. The employee was in a position to order, influence, or induce use of the invention or work ofauthorship by the Government.3.2. The invention or work of authorship was related to the official functions of the employee; or3.3. Government time, materials, or facilities were used in making the invention or preparing thework of authorship.4. Employee Inventions.  4.1. The Staff Judge Advocate of AFMC has designated AFMC LO/JAZ, ESC/JAZ, HSC/JA, 377ABW/JAN, and RL/JA (hereinafter referred to as servicing legal office patent counsel) to provide thenecessary legal services to obtain and maintain patents on behalf of the Air Force.  For Air Forceactivities which do not have a designated servicing legal office patent counsel, AFMC LO/JAZ willprovide the necessary invention processing and patenting services.  Each of the servicing legal officepatent counsels may transfer the invention disclosure to any of the other servicing legal office patentcounsels if technical expertise is not available at the servicing legal office patent counsel that receivedthe invention disclosure.4.2. The servicing legal office patent counsel for the employee’s activity will process each employeeinvention for patenting or publication as a Statutory Invention Registration without cost to theemployee, if the invention involves statutory subject matter within the context of Title 35 UnitedStates Code, Section 101 and receives a favorable technical evaluation and determination that theinvention is within the Air Force mission. As a condition precedent to filing a patent application, theemployee must agree to assign his or her entire right, title, and interest in and to the invention to theGovernment, or acquiesce in a decision on a determination of rights that an assignment is required. 4.3. The servicing legal office patent counsel will obtain an independent evaluation of each inventionfrom the laboratory or other activity where the invention was made, or alternatively, from an activity4AFI51-303   1 SEPTEMBER 1998which has cognizance of the technology of the invention.  The evaluation will be completed using AFForm 1981, Invention Evaluation.  Based on the recommendation of the evaluator and taking intoconsideration the importance of the invention to the Air Force mission, its technology transfer poten-tial, and its patentability, the servicing legal office patent counsel will determine whether it is in thebest interests of the Air Force to file a patent application.  The employee will be notified of the deci-sion.4.4. If the servicing legal office patent counsel does not intend to file a patent application on theinvention, then pursuant to Title 15 United States Code, Section 3710d, the servicing legal officepatent counsel, on behalf of the Air Force, shall allow the inventor/employee to obtain or retain title tothe invention subject to the reservation by the Government of a nonexclusive, nontransferrable, irre-vocable, paid-up license to practice the invention or have the invention practiced throughout the worldby or on behalf of the Government.  4.5. The servicing legal office patent counsel shall provide SAF/GCQ a periodic summary report ofactivities under this paragraph including the information on any issued patents which have beenassigned to the United States of America, as represented by the Secretary of the Air Force, or in whichthe Government has retained a royalty-free, non-exclusive license for government purposes.5. Protection of Invention Rights.  Each employee is responsible for keeping an accurate record regard-ing his or her research, development, or other activity.  All records should be signed and dated by at leasttwo competent witnesses who shall attest that they read and understood the description of the invention,its function, and the method of using it.  If the invention previously was actually reduced to practice andoperated, the witnesses should state not only did they understand the invention, but that they saw theinvention work successfully on a specific date.  Witnessed documents should be safeguarded to serve asproof of either or both conception and reduction to practice.6. Recording and Submitting Inventions.6.1. Each employee must disclose in writing all inventions made during the period of his or heremployment.  Employees should document inventions by completing AF Form 1279, Disclosure andRecord of Invention, and supplement the form with documentation, such as sketches, prints, draw-ings or other illustration to provide a full and complete statement regarding the invention.6.2. Each employee shall  indicate his or her intent to assign his or her entire right, title, and interestin and to the invention to the Government by completing the "Certification of Inventor(s)" section ofAF Form 1279.  If the employee does not agree to assign his or her entire right, title and interest in andto the invention to the Government, then the procedures set forth in paragraph 7. of this AFI must befollowed.6.3. Each employee will forward AF Form 1279 and all supplemental documentation describing aninvention to the servicing legal office patent counsel for the employee’s installation.6.4. An AF Form 1279 describing an employee invention may not be duplicated, used, or disclosed,in whole or in part, for any purpose other than technical and security review, invention evaluation andpatent prosecution, unless prior permission is obtained from the employee, or the servicing legaloffice patent counsel.AFI51-303   1 SEPTEMBER 199856.5. An employee must notify the servicing legal office patent counsel of every pending patent appli-cation and any patent maturing from an application in his or her name relating to inventions made dur-ing Government employment filed through channels other than those of the Air Force.  7. Determination of Rights.7.1. An employee who does not agree to assign his or her entire right, title and interest in and to aninvention to the Government must complete AF Form 1280, Invention Rights Questionnaire, andprovide information necessary to permit a determination of the respective rights of the Governmentand the employee in the invention.  The employee will submit the AF Form 1280 together with his orher job description, which was in effect at the time the invention was made, to the servicing legaloffice patent counsel.  7.2. The servicing legal office patent counsel will prepare and forward to SAF/GCQ a written recom-mendation with reasons supporting the respective rights of the Government and the employee in anyinvention disclosed in AF Form 1279 resulting from research, development, or other activity. The rec-ommendation  will be based upon statements in AF Form 1280, any other information the employee isrequired to submit, and the employee’s job description.7.3. SAF/GCQ, in accordance with the criteria of Executive Order 10096, Providing for a UniformPatent Policy for Government with Respect to Inventions Made by Government Employees and for theAdministration of Such Policy, dated 23 January 1950, as amended by Executive Order 10930, Abol-ishing the Government Patents Board and Providing for the Performance of Its Functions, dated 28March 1961, and its implementing regulation, Title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 501, Uni-form Patent Policy for Rights in Inventions Made by Government Employees, will review the recom-mendation of the servicing legal office patent counsel and render a determination that either:7.3.1. The Government shall obtain, except as herein otherwise provided, the entire right, title,and interest in and to the invention made by the employee;7.3.2. The employee shall retain the entire right, title, and interest in and to the invention, subjectto the reservation by the Government of a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in theinvention with the power to grant licenses for all governmental purposes; or7.3.3. The employee shall retain the entire right, title, and interest in and to the invention, subjectto law.7.4. An employee may submit evidence to establish that any one or more of the conditions of 37C.F.R. Part 501 are absent, and the Government may establish that equitable considerations justify therequirement that the invention and any patent to issue on the invention should be assigned to it.7.5. SAF/GCQ will provide the employee with a signed and dated statement of its determination andreasons therefor and a copy of Title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 501 and will preserve andmake the determination rights available for purposes of appeal.  If the determination is made pursuantto 37 C.F.R. Subpart 501.6(a)(2), SAF/GCQ may impose on the employee any one or all of the fol-lowing conditions or any other conditions that may be necessary in a particular case: 7.5.1. That a patent application be filed in the United States and/or abroad, if  SAF/GCQ hasdetermined that the Government has or may need to practice the invention; 7.5.2. That the invention not be assigned to any foreign-owned or controlled corporation withoutthe written permission of SAF/GCQ; and 6AFI51-303   1 SEPTEMBER 19987.5.3. That any assignment or license of rights to use or sell the invention in the United Statesshall contain a requirement that any products embodying the invention or produced through theuse of the invention be substantially manufactured in the United States.NOTE:SAF/GCQ shall notify the employee of any conditions imposed in its determination. 7.6. Throughout the entire Determination of Rights process, including an appeal, a controversy overthe respective rights of the Government and of the employee shall not unnecessarily delay the filing ofa patent application by the Air Force to avoid the loss of patent rights. In cases coming within thescope of 37 C.F.R. Subpart 501.6(a)(2), the filing of a patent application shall be contingent upon theconsent of the employee. 7.7. Where the servicing legal office patent counsel office has filed a patent application in the UnitedStates, the servicing legal office patent counsel will, within 8 months from the filing date of the U.S.application, determine if any foreign patent applications should also be filed.  If the servicing legaloffice patent counsel chooses not to file an application in any foreign country, the employee mayrequest rights in that country, subject to the conditions stated in paragraph 7.5. that may be imposedby SAF/GCQ.  Alternatively, SAF/GCQ or the servicing legal office patent counsel may permit theemployee to retain foreign rights by including, in any assignment to the Government of an unclassi-fied U.S. patent application on the invention, an option for the Government to acquire title in any for-eign country within 8 months from the filing date of the U.S. application.7.8. The employee may appeal the determination of rights by filing two copies of a notice of appealwith the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology (hereinafter Under Secretary of Commerce)within 30 days (or within a longer period of time granted by the Under Secretary of Commerce forgood cause shown in writing) after receiving notice of the determination by SAF/GCQ.  The addressof the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology is listed in Attachment 1 of this AFI.7.9. AFLSA/JACN serves as the liaison with the Under Secretary of Commerce in the event theemployee appeals the determination of rights.  As such, AFLSA/JACN shall represent the Air Forcein any such appeal and shall file any required documents on behalf of the Air Force.7.10. Any appeal of a Determination of Rights shall be pursued in accordance with regulations pre-scribed by the Department of Commerce.  See 37 C.F.R. Part 501.8.

Because the requirements for licensing inventions are different for inven-tions made under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRDA), the implementingAir Force instructions are found in a different Air Force instruction, namely AFI 61-303.  Air Forcepersonnel should be cognizant of the different requirements between these two instructions.13.2. The Air Force may only grant a license, including a foreign license, if the applicant (or prospec-tive licensee) has submitted a satisfactory plan for development or marketing of the invention, or both,in accordance with Subpart 404.7, Title 37 Code of Federal Regulations.13.3. The Air Force may treat each plan under paragraph 13.2. as commercial and financial informa-tion obtained from a person and privileged and confidential, and not subject to disclosure under Title5 United States Code, Section 552.13.4. Each  application for a license and all inquiries and communications regarding a license will beforwarded by the receiving office immediately to the servicing legal office patent counsel.  The ser-vicing legal office patent counsel will review the application, obtain any missing information, and for-ward the complete application and any advisory recommendation to SAF/GCQ.  13.5. SAF/GCQ will notify the servicing legal office patent counsel of its decision whether toapprove or deny each application for an exclusive or partially exclusive license.  In order to documentthis determination SAF/GCQ will either prepare a memorandum of the decision, based upon all argu-ments and evidence, or recommend to the servicing legal office patent counsel to include the bases forthe determination in the license agreement.  Any such determination documentation shall be consis-tent with Subpart 404.7, Title 37 Code of Federal Regulations. 13.6. Patent licenses will be negotiated on behalf of the laboratory, or other Air Force activity wherethe invention was made, by the servicing legal office patent counsel. Patent licenses shall be negoti-ated consistent with the Air Force model Patent License and guidelines for using the Air Force modelPatent License. The model Patent License and its guidelines shall be distributed to Air Force activitiesby SAF/GCQ.  In any case when the negotiation of a Patent License involves a substantial substantivemodification to a provision of the model Patent License which is required by the guidelines to be usedverbatim, concurrence for such modification shall be obtained from SAF/GCQ.  Such concurrenceshould be requested prior to the signature by any party.  After signature by the licensee(s), the licenseshall be forwarded to SAF/AQ, through SAF/GCQ, for review and signature.  All licenses forwardedto SAF/AQ will have the concurrence of the laboratory or other Air Force activity commander, direc-tor or delegee.
