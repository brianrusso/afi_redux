Purpose:  LCBP  is  a  premier  2-year  developmental  program  with  an  optional  one-year follow  on  assignment  to  the  same  installation,  where  officers  are  competitively  selected  and developed as acquisition, supply chain, and maintenance leaders; with the potential to fill future materiel  leader  /senior  materiel  leader,  logistics/supply  chain  commander  or  maintenance commander  positions  in  the  Air  Force  and  joint  logistics  systems.    Officers  selected  for  this program gain valuable knowledge and experience in managing acquisition, logistics, and product support  aspects  of  the  Air  Force  logistics  system  through  rotational  assignments  in  various functional  areas  of  Air  Force  Sustainment  Center  (AFSC),  Air  Force  Life  Cycle  Management Center (AFLCMC) or Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC); and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  All  career broadening officers (CBOs) will be placed on an acquisition coded position and will be required to obtain a Life Cycle Logistics (LCL) Level I APDP certification for program completion.  After the 2-year program is complete, the final year can be used at the discretion  of  the  ALC  Deputy  Commander  for  Maintenance  (ALC/DCM),  the  AFNWC  Vice Commander (AFNWC/CV), and Defense Logistics Agency Primary Level Field Activity (DLA PLFA)  Commander  to  allow  CBOs  to  gain  additional  experience  within  AFSC,  AFNWC  and DLA functional  areas.   This  additional  year can also  be used to  complete  LCL  Level  II  APDP certification  provided  the  CBO  is  on  a  LCL  coded  position.    Normal  assignment  rules  apply when undergoing a permanent change of station (PCS) to complete this program. 1.2.  Eligible  Career  Fields:  LCBP  is  an  AF/A4-sponsored  Air  Force  Materiel  Command (AFMC) program  that applies to  officers in  the following Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs): 21R (Logistics Readiness), 21A/M (Aircraft Maintenance, Munitions and Missile Maintenance), 61X  (Scientist),  62E  (Engineer),  63A  (Acquisition  Manager),  64PX  (Contracting)  and  65FX (Financial Management).  For DLA CBO positions, only the 21R AFSC is eligible to participate.  For  AFNWC  positions,  only  21M  AFSC  is  eligible  to  participate,  with  core  nuclear  officers receiving priority placement. Note:  These AFSC restrictions apply to the core assigned positions listed in Table 4.1, but do not limit the rotational opportunities on an installation.  Example – A 21A assigned to OO-ALC performs a rotation though DLA Aviation Ogden or the AFNWC/NI directorate located physically at Hill AFB. 1.3.  Description:  This  program  provides  work  experience  in  all  areas  of  acquisition  logistics and  product  support  and  explains  relationships  between  key  logistics  functions  within  the  Air Force  and  DLA.    Officers  rotate  through  designated  wing(s)  or  directorates  as  prescribed  in paragraph  2.10.    While  in  each  organization,  participants  learn  how  different  functions  work together and are given tasks that support mission needs while reinforcing concepts to be learned.  Rotation  through  every  wing  or  directorate  is  desired,  but  the  rotation  process  is  designed  to provide  participants  exposure  to  the  key  elements  of  acquisition  and  life  cycle  logistics  to maximize learning.    AFI36-2111  17 FEBRUARY 2017 5 1.4.  Program  Phases:  The  three  designated  phases  of  the  program,  the  objectives  and  the mandatory requirements are as follows: 1.4.1.  Phase I: Orientation.  This phase consists of in-processing, initial acquisition training, and  an  Air  Force  Materiel  Command  introductory  conference.   This  phase  lasts approximately one month. 1.4.2.  Phase  II:  Rotations.    This  is  a  20-month  long  work-and-learn  phase  emphasizing professional  growth  and  active  participation.    Throughout  this  phase,  CBOs  continue  to complete  logistics  and  acquisition  courses  from  Air  Force  Institute  of  Technology  (AFIT) and  Defense  Acquisition  University  (DAU),  professional  development  seminars,  and  tours.  This phase consists of three 6 to 8-month flexible rotations, defined as Phase IIA, Phase IIB and  Phase  IIC.    Within  AFSC,  LCBP  participants  obtain  experience  in  the  Supply  Chain Management  and  Depot  Maintenance  mission  areas.    Each  CBO  completes  one  rotation  in each  of  the  following  three  mission  areas,  in  any  sequence.    Within  the  Supply  Chain Management mission area, one of the rotations is accomplished within a “commodity” area and  the  other  rotation  is  in  a  “weapon  system”  area.    The  first  rotation  through  the  three mission areas begins after completion of Phase I.  CBOs assigned to the DLA PLFA obtain experience in Demand/Supply Planning, Acquisition, Weapon System Support, Contingency Planning  and  Supply  Chain  Management.    CBOs  assigned  to  the  AFNWC  obtain  nuclear unique  experience  in  joint  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)/DoD  warhead/bomb  management and transport, weapon systems management, maintenance and equipment, nuclear surety and certifications,  acquisitions  and  modifications,    nuclear  materiel  management,  and  supply chain management. 1.4.3.  Phase III:  Two Options.  With the approval of the ALC/DCM, AFNWC/CV or DLA PLFA Commanders, the officer may elect one of two options for the remaining 3-months of the program: Extension of Phase II rotations to compensate for training, leave, or other out of rotation time or the addition of an abbreviated rotation via temporary duty (TDY) in another approved career broadening location. 1.5.  Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP) Certifications:  All CBOs will obtain  a  Level  I  APDP  certification  in  LCL  for  program  completion.    Students  are  placed  in  a LCL acquisition coded position, complete the DAU training as directed by AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management (see courses at http://icatalog.dau.mil) and perform work in a  designated  acquisition  organization  (such  as  an  acquisition  sustainment  unit  or  aircraft sustainment wing) in order to obtain the LCL APDP certification.  If the CBO remains in AFSC, AFNWC,  or  DLA  after  program  completion,  they  may  work  towards  a  LCL  Level  II  APDP certification, provided the CBO is on a LCL acquisition coded position.  CBOs must enroll in the introductory  classes  during  Phase  I  of  the  program  and  plan  ahead  to  ensure  all  APDP certification  requirements  are  met.    Failure  to  complete  all  required  courses  may  impact  the officer’s follow-on  assignment and/or completion of the program.   To ensure CBOs  are placed on  an  LCL  acquisition  coded  position  and  be  placed  as  priority  1  for  DAU  courses,  the  Unit Manning Document (UMD) must reflect the correct acquisition codes in the Manpower Planning and Execution System (MPES) to properly feed the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS). NOTE:    Due  to  the  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  manpower  funding  process,  AFRC sponsored CBOs remain assigned to their home unit throughout their participation in LCBP and are  unable  to  occupy  a  LCL  acquisition  coded  position.    Once  the  AFRC  CBO  completes  the  6 AFI36-2111  17 FEBRUARY 2017 program and all DAU educational requirements, they coordinate with AFSC Logistics Functional Office for APDP adjudication and conferment of appropriate LCL APDP certification. 1.5.1.  Minimum requirements to obtain a APDP LCL Level I certification are occupying an LCL  acquisition  coded  position  for  one  year  of  Life  Cycle  Logistics  experience  in  an acquisition  and/or  sustainment  organization  as  outlined  IAW  the  current  DAU  Catalog.  When  occupying  a  LCL  acquisition  coded  position,  a  CBO  performs  work  in  a  designated acquisition organization to receive credit towards their Level I APDP certification. 1.5.2.  Minimum  requirements  to  obtain  LCL  Level  II  certification  include  occupying  an LCL-coded  position,  two  years  of  Life  Cycle  Logistics  experience  in  an  acquisition  and/or sustainment  organization  and  completion  of  courses  as  outlined  IAW  the  current  DAU Catalog.  AFI36-2111  17 FEBRUARY 2017 7 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

DLA  rotations  include  experience  in  demand/supply  planning,  weapon  system  support, contingency  planning  and  supply  chain  management.    AFNWC  rotations  include  Supply Chain  Management,  Weapons  System  Management,  Product  Quality  Manufacturing  and Nuclear Maintenance.  Other areas may be included at the AFSC (ALC/DCM), AFNWC/CV or DLA PLFA Functional Manager’s discretion.  Training Matrices have been established for all locations and are contained in Attachment 2. 2.10.2.  Keep  reporting  official  informed  of  progress  and  accomplishments  while  rotating through other directorates. 2.10.3.  Notify  the  ALC  Lead  LCBP  Officer,  AFNWC  Lead  LCBP  Officer  or  DLA  PLFA Functional  Manager  of  any  changes  in  duty  phone,  office  symbol,  or  leave  and  Temporary Duty (TDY) absences prior to departure; so accurate rosters can be maintained.  12 AFI36-2111  17 FEBRUARY 2017 2.10.4.  Attend  LCBP  meetings  and  PGCs  as  called  by  the  ALC/DLA  PLFA  Functional Manager or Lead LCBP officer. 2.10.5.  Complete training requirements and attain certification for APDP Level certification requirements as outlined in para. 1.5 2.11.  Host Wing FSS (for DLA this is accomplished by 11 FSS at Andrews AFB): 2.11.1.  Ensure  all  LCBP  officers  are  administratively  assigned  to  the  Host  Wing  FSS  after AFPC/DP2L  assigns  officers  for  program  participation  by  Personnel  Accounting  Symbol (PAS) administration. 2.11.2.  Ensure  only  LCBP  personnel  are  assigned  to  LCBP  authorizations.    LCBP participants  remain  assigned  to  the  same  PAS  for  two  years  regardless  of  their  rotational assignments. 2.11.3.  LCBP participants PCS or PCA upon completion of the two-year program.  AFI36-2111  17 FEBRUARY 2017 13 Chapter 3 ROTATIONAL TRAINING PLANS 3.1.  Objectives:  Training  objectives  for  LCBP  are  outlined  in  the  training  matrices  for  the ALCs,  AFNWC  and  DLA  PLFA  and  are  provided  in  Figure  A2.1.,  Figure  A3.1.  and  Figure A4.1.    These  are  documented  by  the  CBO  and  tracked  locally.    These  objectives  are  reviewed annually to ensure accuracy. 3.2.  Intent:  The  intent  of  the  training  objectives  is  to  expose  CBOs  to  key  logistics  concepts and issues within their  LCBP assignment.   These training objectives are  not  confined solely to one rotation and require continued accomplishment throughout the entire assignment. 3.3.  Focus:  It  is  unrealistic  to  expect  a  CBO  to  master  these  objectives  over  the  course  of several  months  for  each  rotation.    Instead,  each  rotation  should  be  used  to  focus  efforts  and attention  on  key  learning  objectives.    The  intent  is  for  CBOs  to  satisfy  the  training  objectives first  through  a  combination  of  methods  to  include  hands-on,  training  courses,  workshops,  self-study and readings.  ALC/DCM, AFNWC/CV, DLA PLFA Commanders and program mentors play a significant  role in mentoring, counseling and assessing officer development with respect to  the  attached  objectives.    At  the  end  of  a  CBO’s  assignment,  he/she  should  be  able  to comfortably  discuss  the  key  points  associated  with  each  of  the  objectives  outlined  in  Figure A2.1., Figure A3.1. and Figure A4.1.    14 AFI36-2111  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 4 SELECTION PROCEDURES 4.1.  21X  AFSC  Selection:  The  following  guidance  outlines  the  process  for  the  21X  active component officer selection for the LCBP.  Officers use their Airman Development Plan (ADP) to communicate their desire to participate in the LCBP to Development Teams (DTs).  DTs from the 21X career fields  are responsible for selecting officers to  attend LCBP during their fall DT meetings  (6XX  officers  use  the  guidance  contained  in  paragraph  4.2.    Air  Force  Reserve Officers use the guidance contained in paragraph 4.3.). 4.1.1.  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC)  notifies  the  DTs  of  the  program  timeline  and processes to meet assignment timelines. 4.1.2.  The  DTs  receive  supplemental  guidance  in  a  separate  message  from  their  respective career  field  managers  outlining  individual  board  processes  and  program  vacancies  for  the following fiscal year. 4.1.3.  AFPC  reviews  candidate  eligibility  to  ensure  officers  satisfy  time-on-station  (TOS) requirements, meet primary career path goals and ensure timing of LCBP entry is appropriate and applicable for each officer. 4.1.4.  Officers are notified of their eligibility for the LCBP through an email or Assignment Management System (AMS) Robot message from AFPC. 4.1.5.  During  fall  DT  meetings,  the  teams  make  selections  to  fill  program  vacancies  as outlined in Table 4.1. 4.1.6.  An appropriate number of alternates are designated to fill potential vacancies. 4.1.7.  Results  of  the  selection  process  are  published  in  a  consolidated  selection  message NLT 30 days after the last selection board and identify selected officers and the gaining unit. 4.2.  6XX  AFSC  Selection:  Eligible  officers  submit  applications  in  accordance  with  current year’s Advanced Academic Degree and Special Experience Exchange Duties Selection Process Guide available through MyPers. 4.2.1.  LCBP candidates are competitively boarded and approved by the 6XX CFMs  within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (SAF/AQ) or Financial Management (SAF/FM). 4.2.2.  Selection  results  are  published  via  Personnel  Services  Delivery  Memorandum.  Projected  Report  No  Later  than  Dates  and  the  gaining  units  will  be  assigned  by  the appropriate Officer Assignment Team at AFPC. 4.2.3.  Alternates may be designated to fill potential vacancies. 4.3.  AFRC  Selection:  The  following  guidance  outlines  the  process  for  the  selection  of  Air Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  officers  into  the  LCBP.    Program  participation  depends  on AFRC officer availability and AFMC coordination for additional CBO positions for the program. 4.3.1.  AFRC funds two LCBP positions per year for officers with a primary AFSC of 21X.  These positions are in addition to the active component positions annotated in Table 4.1 and require coordination with AFMC each year to ensure proper placement of potential CBOs.  AFI36-2111  17 FEBRUARY 2017 15 4.3.2.  21X officers interested in the LCBP communicate their desires in their AFRC Officer Development Plan. 4.3.3.  Eligible  candidate  records  are  reviewed,  scored  and  ranked  by  the  AFRC  21X  DTs during their annual DT meeting. 4.3.4.  After verification by the CFM, results are published NLT 30 days after selection.  The published  results  identify  selected  officers,  in  addition  to  projected  Report  No  Later  than Dates and gaining units. 4.3.5.  The AFRC 21X DTs vector LCBP graduates into an appropriate Reserve assignment upon  completion  of  LCBP,  to  include  assignment  as  a  Traditional  Reservist,  Air  Reserve Technician or Individual Mobilization Augmentee.  AFRC does not normally fund follow-on active  component  assignments,  TDYs  or  PCSs  upon  completion  of  LCBP,  and  officers should not expect to be vectored into such an assignment. 4.3.6.  Reserve  CBOs  are  awarded  the  Special  Experience  Identifier  (SEI)  “LLA”  upon successful  completion  of  the  LCBP,  IAW  procedures  established  in  paragraph  8.1  of  this AFI. 4.4.  Commander’s  Involvement:  Commanders are encouraged to indicate officers’ desires to attend LCBP in the ADP and in officer evaluations. 4.5.  Allocations:  The DTs select 16 or 17 (alternating years) officers and assigns them based on the  matrix  provided  below  for  a  total  of  33  officers  participating  in  the  program  at  any  given time.  An appropriate number of alternates are designated to fill potential vacancies. Table 4.1.  Career Field Allocations.

Rating  Officials:  CBOs  assigned  to  AFMC  are  assigned  under  the  ALC/DCM  or AFNWC/CV,  are  rated  by  the  ALC/DCM  or  AFNWC/CV  and  receive  Officer  Performance Reports  (OPRs).    For  active  component  CBOs  assigned  to  AFMC,  the  senior  rater  position designated  by  the  Management  Level  for  the  ratee’s  organizational  Personnel  Accounting Symbol  (PAS)  is  the  additional  rater  and  reviewer  on  the  CBO’s  OPRs;  and  completes promotion recommendation forms (PRFs).  Active component CBOs assigned to DLA are rated by  the  first  O-6  in  their  chain  of  command  and  have  the  PLFA  Commander  serve  as  the additional  rater.    An  AF  Form  77,  Letter  of  Evaluation  (LOE),  for  each  CBO  is  sent  to  raters following each rotation within 30-days of rotation completion. 6.1.1.  Reserve  CBOs  participating  in  this  program  at  an  AFMC  ALC  (i.e.,  unit  of attachment) are rated by the ALC/DCM and receive OPRs with the ALC/DCM also serving as the additional rater.  Reserve CBOs participating in this program  at a DLA activity (i.e., unit  of  attachment)  are  rated  by  the  first  O-6  in  the  DLA  chain  of  command  and  have  the PLFA  Commander  serve  as  the  additional  rater.    In  all  instances,  Reserve  CBO  OPRs  are sent to the ratee’s unit of assignment for reviewer endorsement. 6.2.  Performance  Reports:  Complete  LCBP  participant’s  OPR  according  to  AFI  36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems. 6.2.1.  Duty  title  (Block  II  of  AF  Form  707,  Officer  Performance  Report)  for  LCBP participants for all reporting periods is: “USAF Logistics Career Broadening Officer.” 6.2.2.  Include the following statements in each participant's job description (Block II of AF Form 707, Officer Performance Report (Lt thru Col)) on performance reports: 6.2.2.1.  “-  Competitively  selected  for  HQ  AF  Logistics  Development  Program  focused on fielding Materiel Management Leaders.” 6.2.2.2.  “- Completed duty rotations in the Air Force Sustainment Center, leading depot-level  maintenance  and  supply  chain  activities.”    For  DLA  participants,  replace  this statement with  “-Completed duty  rotations in  Defense  Logistics Agency, leading depot-level  maintenance  and  supply  chain  activities.”    For  AFNWC  participants,  replace  this statement  with  “Completed  duty  rotation  at  the  Air  Force  Nuclear  Weapons  Center, leading depot-level maintenance and supply chain activities.” 6.2.2.3.  “-  Focused on  weapon system modernization, life cycle management, logistics, and product support.” 6.2.3.  The  final  line  of  the  participant’s  job  description  (Block  II  of  AF  Form  707)  is reserved  for  the  CBO’s  rater  to  capture  the  officer’s  responsibilities  for  the  rotation(s) completed during the reporting period.  For active component CBOs, the following statement is placed in Section VI, the reviewer’s comments block:  “ADDITIONAL RATER IS ALSO THE REVIEWER.”  18 AFI36-2111  17 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 7 ADDITIONAL DUTIES AND DEPLOYMENTS 7.1.  Expectations:  Additional duties for officers in the program should be minimal and only be assigned with the approval of the Program Advisor identified in paragraph 2.8. 7.2.  Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) Posturing Guidance  :  Officers in the LCBP are considered to be in a training status and, as a general rule, unavailable for deployment during the  2-years  of  the  program.    Officers  in  the  LCBP  are  assigned  Deployment  Availability  Code (DAV)  64  in  MilPDS  for  the  duration  of  their  assignment  to  the  program.    Upon  selection  to attend the LCBP, unit commanders initiate the approval process for a DAV 64 on the individual prior to the start of the member’s AEF vulnerability period--usually 7-8 months prior to the start of  their  postured  AEF  rotation  period--in  order  to  preclude  any  potential  deployment  taskings.  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF)  Functional  Area  Managers  (FAMs)  must  provide  specific guidance to respective AFMC FAMs to ensure this process is managed correctly.  AFI36-2111  17 FEBRUARY 2017 19 Chapter 8 PROGRAM COMPLETION AND FOLLOW-ON ASSIGNMENTS 8.1.  Special  Experience  Indicators:  Upon  successful  completion  of  this  two-year  program, LCBP participants are awarded the Special Experience  Identifier  (SEI)  “LLA.”  AFPC and the respective  development  team  are  actively  involved  in  selecting/vectoring  graduates  for  their follow-on assignments. 8.2.  Subsequent  Assignments:  LCBP  is  focused  on  developing  materiel  management  leaders of  tomorrow  and  LCBP  graduates  are  required  to  complete  a  payback  assignment  following graduation.    CBOs  remaining  at  the  same  duty  station  at  the  conclusion  of  the  2  year  program should be assigned to duties that capitalize on the skills acquired through LCBP participation, or are  consistent  with  their  AFSC‘s  career  development.    Development  teams/AFPC  assignment teams  manage  payback  assignments  (timing  and  location)  in  concert  with  developmental  plans for individual officers. 8.3.  Active  Duty  Service  Commitment  (ADSC):  Career  Broadening  Officers  incur  a  3-year ADSC  upon  completion  of  the  program  as  described  in  AFI  36-2107,  Active  Duty  Service Commitments.  Career Broadening Officers complete the program one of three ways:  successful completion of all training requirements; self-elimination from the program; or removal from the program  for  the  good  of  the  Air  Force.    Officers  who  self-eliminate  from  the  program  or  are removed from the program for the good of the Air Force return to their core AFSC career field. JOHN B.
