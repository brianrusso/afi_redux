Overview.  This Instruction is intended to provide requirements to report, track, and resolve non-compliance  with  environmental  laws,  regulations,  and  standards.    It  also  provides requirements for the reporting and tracking of environmental releases, inspections, and fines and penalties associated with non-compliance.  The Environmental Reporting Playbook is available on the CE Portal https://app.eis.af.mil/A7CPORTAL/Pages/default.aspx to provide additional guidance  regarding  implementation  of  this  Instruction.  This  Instruction  is  part  of  the Environmental  Management  System  (EMS)  mandated  by  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, and expanded by  E.O.  13514,  Federal  Leadership  in  Environmental,  Energy,  and  Economic  Performance; Department  of  Defense  Directive  (DoDD)  4715.1E,  Environment,  Safety,  and  Occupational Health (ESOH); Department of Defense Directive (DoDI) 4715.17, Environmental Management System;  and  AFI  32-7001,  Environmental  Management.    It  also  contributes  to  AF  compliance with Title 10 United States Codes (U.S.C.) Section (§) 2706: Annual Reports to Congress, which requires The Secretary of Defense submit to Congress each year, a report on the progress made in carrying out activities under the environmental quality programs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the military departments. 1.2.  Goals.  The  goal  for  installations  within  the  United  States  and  its  territories  is  to  achieve and maintain compliance with applicable federal, state, local environmental laws and regulations, and  AF  guidance  and  instructions.    The  goal  for  enduring  locations  in  overseas  locations  is  to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable international agreement requirements and Final Governing Standards (FGS), or if no FGS exists, the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance Document (OEBGD).  Key factors in attaining these goals are acquiring and reporting accurate and reliable information on the status of AF compliance with such standards. 1.3.  Objectives.  Identify and proactively address circumstances that may lead to the issuance of new  Enforcement  Actions  (EAs)  and  Host  Nation  Enforcement  Actions  (HNEAs).    Place management emphasis on oversight and execution of proper practices.  Encourage leadership to vigorously  pursue  a  return  to  compliance  and  closure  of  existing  EAs/HNEAs.    Use  EA  trend analyses and identify root causes to develop actions to prevent future repeat or similar findings.  Achieve  objectives  by  providing  standardized  and  timely  information  to  leaders  and  program managers  so  that  they  can  assess  the  overall  health  of  the  AF  environmental  compliance program,  demonstrate  progress  made  toward  AF  compliance  goals,  and  identify  areas  for improvement. AFI32-7047  22 JANUARY 2015   5  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

The  AF  shall  report  and  track  regulatory  and  HNGA  inspections, spills/releases,  and  non-compliance  related  issues  using  the  EASI  database  (or  current  AF approved database). 3.2.  Reporting  and  Tracking  Inspections.  Installations  shall  report  regulatory  and  HNGA inspections within five (5) business  days of the start  of an inspection using the EASI database, Inspections Module.  Installations shall complete all data fields and upload all inspection reports to  the  EASI  database.    A  single  media  or  multi-media  inspection  shall  be  tracked  as  one inspection per media area inspected regardless of length or duration. (T-1). 3.3.  Reporting  and  Tracking  Spills/Releases.  Installations  and  IEF  shall  execute  all  release notification and reporting requirements according to applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations  and  in  accordance  with  AFI  10-2501,  Air  Force  Emergency  Management  (EM) Program  Planning  and  Operations,  AFI  10-206,  Operational  Reporting.  (T-0).    For  overseas installations, release notification and reporting requirements shall be accomplished in accordance with  international  agreement  provisions  and  the  country-specific  FGS  or,  if  no  FGS  exists,  the OEBGD.  (T-0).   All  installations shall report spills  and releases within one business  day using the  EASI  database,  Spill  Module  (also  known  as  the  Spill  Incident  Release  Internet  System [SIRIS]). (T-1). 3.3.1.  When releases meet one or more of the criteria reported in paragraphs 3.2.1.1 through 3.2.1.10,  the  appropriate  IEF  shall  notify  AF/A4CF,  by  telephone  or  email  as  soon  as possible but no more than one business day after a spill/release is reported by the installation. (T-2). 3.3.1.1.  Results in injury or loss of life. 3.3.1.2.  Results in loss of aircraft or facility. 3.3.1.3.  Causes interruption of flying operations. 3.3.1.4.  Causes environmental contamination extending beyond installation boundaries. 3.3.1.5.  Creates potential of financial impact exceeding $50,000. 3.3.1.6.  Results in or may result in litigation, publicity, or media coverage. 3.3.1.7.  Contaminates a body of water and/or waters of the US. 3.3.1.8.  Involves a release to the environment of 25 gallons or more of petroleum, oils, or lubricants (POL) or the release of POL causes a film or sheen on nearby surface water.  If the release is entirely contained on a hard surface with no environmental contamination, EASI reporting is not required. 3.3.1.9.  Is estimated to be equal to or greater than a Reportable Quantity (RQ). 3.3.1.10.  Involves sewage and one or more of the following conditions apply: 3.3.1.10.1.  The  release  may  cause  imminent  and  substantial  threat  to  public  health, safety, or the environment.   14  AFI32-7047  22 JANUARY 2015 3.3.1.10.2.  A release in any amount reportable to a regulatory or permitting authority. 3.3.1.10.3.  A release of 1,000 gallons or more. 3.3.2.  Follow-up  Release  Reporting.    Installations  shall  provide  follow-up  reports  on incidents  meeting  any  of  the  criteria  listed  in  paragraph  3.3.1  to  their  assigned  IEF  by telephone, email, OPREP-3 (see AFI 10-2501), and updating the EASI database, as required by the situation.  The  IEF shall submit follow-up information  to  AF/A4CF by telephone or email.    Installations  shall  continue  to  update  the  EASI  database  Spill  Module  when completing immediate corrective actions and coordinate with IEF and AFCEC/CZT to close each reportable incident. (T-2). 3.4.  Reporting  Non-Compliance  Related  Issues.  Installations shall report  all written notices, e-mail messages, field citations, and other correspondence from regulatory agencies pertaining to non-compliance with applicable environmental requirements within one business day through the EASI  database.    Installations  in  overseas  locations  shall  report  all  written  notices,  e-mail messages, and other correspondence from appropriate HNGA (e.g., Ministry of Defense, federal, state,  regional,  community  officials)  of  noncompliance  with  any  environmental  standard  that applies pursuant to applicable country-specific FGS or, if no FGS exists, the OEBGD.  Overseas installations shall report such notification within one business day through the EASI database.  If the notification must be translated into English, installations shall upload the notification within seven (7) business days.  All organizations shall utilize the EASI database to capture the required data.    In  addition,  installations  shall  aggressively  pursue  the  closure  of  open  EAs/HNEAs  in EASI.  (T-1). 3.5.  Identifying  EAs/HNEAs.  The  IEF,  AFCEC/CZT  and  RCOs  shall  decide  by  consensus whether  or  not  a  written  notice  of  non-compliance  issued  by  a  regulatory  agency  shall  be designated as an EA.  The IEF, AFCEC/CZT and RCO have three (3) business days to determine whether  written  notice  of  non-compliance  from  a  regulatory  agency  meets  the  criteria  and classification  of  an  EA.    If  only  two  parties  agree  to  track  as  an  EA,  the  dissenting  party  may request  a  review  of  that  decision  by  AF/A4CF.    AF/A4CF  will  expect  a  formal  position  from AFCEC/CZ.    AF/A4CF  notifies  SAF/IEE  and,  when  appropriate,  SAF/GCN,  if  and  why consensus was not achieved.  For overseas installations, the appropriate IEF is AFCEC/CF, who shall coordinate with the MAJCOM/JA to determine whether a written notice of non-compliance issued by a HNGA meets the minimum criteria identified in the HNEA definition.  The IEF may delegate  its  responsibility  for  identifying  HNEAs  to  the  Numbered  Air  Force  (NAF) Environmental Function after consultation with the MAJCOM ESOHC, but any delegation shall be  in  writing  and  a  copy  of  the  delegation  document  shall  be  provided  to  AFCEC/CZ, MAJCOM/JA, AF/A4CF, and ELFSC. (T-1). 3.5.1.  Enforcement  Action  (EA).    A  formal,  written  notification  by  the  EPA  or  other authorized  federal,  state,  inter-state,  regional  or  local  environmental  regulatory  agency  of violation  of  any  applicable  statutory  or  regulatory  requirement.    Sub-paragraphs  3.5.1.1 through  3.5.1.9  shall  be  followed  when  determining  what  type  of  written  notification  does and does not constitute an EA. 3.5.1.1.  A  formal,  written  notification  may  include  a  letter,  inspection  report,  field citation,  e-mail  message,  unilaterally  issued  compliance  order,  or  other  written correspondence sent from a regulatory agency by a person authorized to issue notices of violation and other incidences of non-compliance. AFI32-7047  22 JANUARY 2015   15  3.5.1.2.  The content of the letter (not the subject line or title on the letter) shall determine whether a formal, written notification is an EA.  For example, if the subject line or title states “potential,” “possible” or “alleged” violation, but the text of the letter clearly states the installation is not in compliance with  a regulatory requirement (e.g., cites violations of  environmental  laws  or  regulations),  then  it  shall  be  reported  as  an  EA  in  accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3. 3.5.1.3.  EAs include notifications of violation of applicable permits, consent agreements, and  compliance  orders.    They  also  include  warning  letters  or  similarly  titled  formal written notifications referring to  violations of applicable permits, agreements,  orders, or releases of contaminants into the environment. 3.5.1.4.  EAs  do  not  include  written  communications  that  do  not  cite  a  violation  of  an applicable  environmental  law  or  regulation,  or  notices  of  deficiencies  to  permit applications. 3.5.1.5.  One  written  notice,  regardless  of  the  number  of  individual  violations,  findings, or  citations  listed  in  it,  counts  as  one  EA,  if  all  violations  cited  relate  to  a  single environmental law or regulation.  If the written notification cites violations of more than one environmental law or regulation then it is counted as multiple EAs, one under each applicable environmental law or regulation. 3.5.1.6.  Multiple  written  notices  that  cite  the  same  violation  of  law  or  regulation  at different facilities, sites, or locations under the operation or control of the installation will be counted as one if the notices are issued by the same regulatory agency and that agency either a) considers the multiple notices to be part of one enforcement action, b) withdraws the  multiple  notices  and reissues  one  notice  that  alleges  violations  at  multiple  facilities, sites,  or  locations,  or  c)  agrees  to  combine  the  various  notifications  or  otherwise  treat them as part of one enforcement action. 3.5.1.7.  Internal  or  other  DoD  component  review,  compliance  review,  audit,  or inspection that identifies a violation of any applicable statutory or regulatory requirement is not to be counted as an EA. 3.5.1.8.  Any  written  correspondence  from  a  regulatory  agency  addressing  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6901 to 6992k) Corrective Actions or  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensation,  and  Liability  Act (CERCLA,  42  U.S.C.  §§  9601  to  9675)  requirements  which  will  be  corrected  using Environmental  Restoration  Account  (ERA)  funds  are  to  be  excluded  from  external  EA reporting,  but  will  be  tracked  internal  to  the  AF.    However,  if  RCRA  or  CERCLA cleanup  activities  themselves  generate  an  EA  that  is  issued  under  some  authority  other than  CERCLA  or  RCRA's  Corrective  Action  provisions,  the  EA  shall  be  included  in external EA reporting. 3.5.1.9.  EAs  do  not  include  notifications  of  violation  of  federal,  state,  or  local environmental  impact  analysis  (e.g.,  National  Environmental  Policy  Act),  historic preservation  (e.g.,  National  Historic  Preservation  Act),  emergency  planning  (e.g., Emergency  Planning  and  Community  Right-to-Know  Act),  or  occupational  safety  and health (e.g., Occupational Safety and Health Act) requirements.  Notifications regarding such requirements are reported in EASI, but are not tracked and managed as EAs.   16  AFI32-7047  22 JANUARY 2015 3.5.2.  Host  Nation  Enforcement  Action  (HNEA).    A  formal,  written  notification  by  the appropriate HNGA that  an installation located outside the US  and its territories violated an environmental  standard  contained  in  the  applicable  country-specific  Final  Governing Standards  or  DoDD  4715.05-G,  Overseas  Environmental  Baseline  Guidance  Document, whichever applies.  If the written notification cites a standard that is not contained in the FGS or  OEBGD,  installations  should  consult  the  appropriate  IEF  for  guidance.    The  IEF  will consult the MAJCOM/JA and appropriate Lead Environmental Component (formerly called DoD Environmental Executive Agent), if necessary, to determine if compliance with the HN requirement is mandatory. (T-0).  If compliance with the HN requirement is mandatory, then the notification of violation of that HN standard will be treated as an HNEA. 3.5.2.1.  One  written  notice,  regardless  of  the  number  of  individual  violations,  findings, or  citations  listed  in  it,  counts  as  one  HNEA  if  all  violations  cited  relate  to  a  single environmental  media.    If  the  written  notification  cites  violations  of  more  than  one environmental media (e.g., air, waste water, drinking water, hazardous waste, etc.), then count it as multiple HNEAs, one under each applicable media area. 3.5.2.2.  Items found to be out of compliance during an internal or other DoD Component review, compliance review or audit, are not to be counted as (included in this definition of) HNEAs. 3.5.2.3.  The  written  notification  need  not  cite  the  specific  standard  or  criteria  of  the applicable FGS, OEBGD, or other requirement source to be met.  The written notification need not request or direct the installation to take corrective action. 3.5.2.4.  HNEAs  do  not  include  warning  letters  that  do  not  cite  a  violation  of  the applicable  FGS,  OEBGD,  or  other  requirement  source,  informal  notices  of  deficiencies (e.g.,  field  inspection  notes  versus  field  citations),  or  notices  of  deficiencies  to  permit applications. 3.5.3.  Classification of EA/HNEA.  Along with making an EA decision, the appropriate IEF, AFCEC/CZT  and  RCO  have  three  (3)  business  days  to  determine  the  classification  of  the written correspondence and report it in EASI.  These parties shall also determine if EA meets the  criteria  for  High  Visibility  as  defined  in  the  Environmental  Reporting  Playbook.    For overseas  installations,  the  appropriate  IEF  coordinates  with  the  MAJCOM/JA  to  determine the classification and whether an HNEA meets the criteria for a High Visibility HNEA.  (T-1). 3.5.3.1.  Administrative  (A).    Any  non-compliance  relating  to  incomplete  paperwork  or lack of detail, such as, but not limited to: failing to complete forms in their entirety; note dates  on  forms;  note  land-ban  information;  keep  logs  up  to  date;  or  document  required training. 3.5.3.2.  Operational  (O).    Any  non-compliance  relating  to  how  business  is  conducted, such as, but  not limited to: failing to  make proper notifications; obtain required permits before  conducting  operations  that  require  permits;  submit  required  samples  in  a  timely manner;  storing  hazardous  waste  beyond  allowed  timeframes;  lacking  training  or certification required by law; or transporting hazardous waste without a manifest. 3.5.3.3.  Project (P).  Any non-compliance requiring the initiation of a project to fund the work and/or significant construction and/or demolition, such as but not limited to: when AFI32-7047  22 JANUARY 2015   17  permit standards are exceeded and substantial facility repairs, modifications, or upgrades must be made to regain compliance. 3.6.  Reporting  and  Tracking  of  EA/HNEA.  Installations  and  IEF  shall  utilize  the  EASI database for data management, reporting and tracking (T-1).  The appropriate IEF shall input the EA/HNEA  determination  into  the  EASI  database  within  three  (3)  business  days  after  the consensus designation that the written notice of non-compliance is an EA/HNEA. (T-1).  Once the  installation  receives  automated  notification  by  EASI  of  EA/HNEA  determination,  the installation  shall  immediately  notify  the  Installation  Commander  and  input  all  required information into the EASI database within three (3) business days. (T-2).  Overseas installations should  consult  the  FGS  or  OEBGD,  whichever  applies,  and  the  DoD  Lead  Environmental Component  for  any  additional  reporting  requirements.    Installations  shall  upload  an  electronic copy of any correspondence between the AF and the regulating agency regarding the EA/HNEA into  the  EASI  database  within  three  (3)  business  days  of  receipt  to  include  closure documentation. (T-1). 3.6.1.  EA/HNEA  Status.    The  appropriate  IEF,  AFCEC/CZT  and  RCO  shall  determine  the status  of the EA and  report  through the EASI database.   In overseas locations,  the  IEF and MAJCOM/JA shall determine the status of an HNEA and report through the EASI database. (T-1). 3.6.1.1.  Unresolved  EA/HNEA.    An  EA/HNEA  for  which  any  deficiency  has  not  been corrected. 3.6.1.2.  Pending  EA/HNEA.    An  EA/HNEA  for  which  a  deficiency  has  been  corrected but remains open pending agreement by the regulator that it is closed or rescinded. 3.6.1.3.  Disputed  EA/HNEA.    An  EA/HNEA  for  which  the  AF  disagrees  that  there  is non-compliance or disagrees that  the  requirement  is  applicable to the installation and is working with the regulator toward resolution.  A disputed EA/HNEA does not include an EA/HNEA in which only the fine or penalty is in dispute or being negotiated.  A disputed EA/HNEA  shall  be  tracked,  but  not  reported  outside  of  the  AF  until  the  dispute  is resolved. 3.6.1.4.  Rescinded  EA.    Formal  written  correspondence  from  a  regulating  agency classified as an EA that, for any reason, is revoked by the issuing agency. 3.6.2.  Updates  to  the  EASI  database.    Installations  shall  provide  real  time  updates  to  EA entries  in  the  EASI  database.    In  the  event  that  no  changes  have  occurred,  this  shall  be annotated at least monthly.  IEF shall validate data in the EASI database by the fifth business day of each month.  All offices shall meet the suspense date to their HHQ so that AF/A4CF can review and forward monthly data to SAF/IEE.  A root cause code and corrective action details resulting from the root cause analysis for the EA/HNEA shall be entered in the EASI database.    The  purpose  of  the  codes  is  to  identify  the  underlying  cause  for  violations  or incidents and to aid in trend analysis and creating solutions to prevent recurrence. (T-1). 3.7.  Compliance  Agreements  (CAs).  A  CA  is  a  multi-party  agreement,  consent  order, interagency  agreement,  or  other  compliance  document  negotiated  between  a  regulatory  agency located  in  the  US  or  a  US  territory  and  the  installation.    Upon  receipt  of  a  proposed  CA, installation  personnel  shall  notify  the  installation  SJA  and  CEI  immediately.    Within  one business day, the installation shall report receipt of the proposed CA to the appropriate IEF and   18  AFI32-7047  22 JANUARY 2015 the  appropriate  SAF/IEE  REO.    The  Installation  or  IEF  shall  initiate  a  CA  entry  in  the  EASI database.  A signed CA in no way negates the need to close EAs, in accordance with Chapter 4 of this Instruction, and complete corrective actions associated with those EAs.  The CA cannot be  closed  until  the  corrective  actions  are  complete.    Installations  track  CA  updates  using  the EASI  database  until  all  findings  from  the  associated  EA(s)  are  closed.    Chapter  4  of  this Instruction specifies closure requirements for CAs. (T-1). 3.7.1.  RCOs,  in  coordination  with  installation SJA,  appropriate  CEI  personnel,  IEF,  and/or others (e.g., REO, AFCEC/CZT, AF/A4CF, ELFSC, and MAJCOM ELO), negotiate CAs or orders, or their equivalent, with local, state, or federal regulators. (T-1). 3.7.2.  To  facilitate  closing  EAs,  CAs  or  orders  need  to  establish  mutually  agreeable milestones for resolving issues of non-compliance and clearly state criteria for closure of the EA. 3.7.3.  Proposed  mutual  CAs  or  orders,  or  their  equivalent,  shall  be  consistent  with agreements or orders signed by other AF installations and must not establish an unfavorable precedent.    Only  Installation  Commanders  may  sign  CAs  or  orders,  or  their  equivalent,  on behalf of AF.  This authority may not be delegated.  Installation Commanders shall not sign agreements  until  coordination  with  appropriate  AF  agencies  has  been  completed.    Before making  any  recommendation  to  an  Installation  Commander  to  sign,  RCOs  shall  submit  all proposed  mutual  CAs  or  orders,  or  their  equivalent,  to  AFLOA/JACE  Division  Chief  for review and approval.  AFLOA/JACE shall coordinate the review of any precedent setting or contentious  CAs  or  orders,  or  their  equivalent,  with  SAF/GCN  to  ensure  appropriate visibility. (T-1). 3.7.4.  Installations  provide  real  time  updates  to  the  EASI  database.    IEF  shall  provide additional information, if needed, and validate data in the EASI database by the fifth business day  of  the  month.    All  offices  shall  meet  the  suspense  date  to  their  HHQ  so  AF/A4CFcan review and forward monthly data by mid-month to SAF/IEE. (T-1). 3.8.  Fines and Penalties.  Civil fines or penalties levied against AF installations as the result of environmental  EAs  normally  are  the  funding  responsibility  of  that  installation.    Commanders shall  determine  the  specific  internal  funding  realignment  necessary  to  fund  these  costs.  (T-1).  Commanders  shall  ensure  that  the  correct  appropriation  is  used  to  fund  these  costs.  (T-0).  Although Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds may be used, environmental quality (EQ) funds shall not be used to pay fines, penalties, or SEPs.  (T-1).  SEPs are projects performed in lieu of fines and penalties levied by the EPA or other regulatory agency.  The Air Force views SEPs as equivalent to paying a fine, therefore, the funding guidance for fines and penalties also applies  to  SEPs.    Installations  shall  seek,  through  their  assigned  IEF  and  RCO,  AFLOA/JACE Division Chief approval  a minimum of ten (10) business days prior to paying a fine or penalty (including  a  SEP)  to  a  regulatory  agency  as  part  of  a  mutual  or  unilateral  compliance  order  or settlement. (T-1).  Under no circumstance shall a fine or penalty (including a SEP) be paid until coordination  with  the  appropriate  IEF  and  RCO,  and  AFLOA/JACE  Division  Chief  gives approval.  (T-1).  When significant  legal  issues are involved, the AFLOA/JACE Division Chief will  consult  with  SAF/GCN  and  SAF/IEE  before  approving  payments  of  fines,  penalties,  and SEPs. AFI32-7047  22 JANUARY 2015   19  Chapter 4 ENFORCEMENT ACTION (EA), HOST NATION ENFORCEMENT ACTION (HNEA), AND COMPLIANCE AGREEMENT (CA) RESOLUTION AND CLOSURE 4.1.  Closing EAs.  An EA may be closed or, if applicable, rescinded if any of these conditions exist: 4.1.1.  Regulator revokes or rescinds the action in writing. 4.1.2.  Regulator issues written notice (to include email notification) that the action is closed. 4.1.3.  Regulatory  agency  which  issued  the  EA  does  not  respond  within  sixty  (60)  days following written notice (sent via email with receipt response, certified mail or other delivery confirmation  receipt  method)  informing  the  regulator  that  the  installation  is  in  full compliance  concerning  the  matters  cited  in  the  EA.    (See  Attachment  2  for  sample  60-day close out correspondence) 4.1.3.1.  Sixty (60) day closeout correspondence may be sent after it is determined by the installation and appropriate IEF that all actions necessary to close the EA have been taken but a formal response by the regulator has not been received. 4.1.3.2.  If  the  regulator  responds  within  the  sixty  (60)  day  window  with  additional requirements,  the  EA  may  need  to  stay  open.    If  the  regulator  responds  after  sixty  (60) days with additional requirements to close the EA, the original EA is reopened. 4.1.4.  Satisfaction of the terms of closure specified in a signed CA or order. 4.1.5.  Discovery  and  verification  by  AFCEC/CZT    or  REO  that  the  EA  is  not  open  on regulatory  agency  records,  no  further  action  is  required  and  AFCEC/CZT  closes  the  EQ  in EASI. 4.2.  Closing  HNEAs.  An  HNEA  may  be  closed  or,  if  applicable,  rescinded  if  any  of  these conditions exist: 4.2.1.  HNGA  issues  written  notification  stating  that  it  is  satisfied  with  the  actions  taken  to resolve the cited violation(s). 4.2.2.  The HNGA revokes or rescinds the action in writing. 4.2.3.  The HNGA does not respond within sixty (60) days following written notice (sent via certified  mail  or  other  delivery  confirmation  receipt  method)  informing  the  HNGA  that  the installation is in full compliance concerning the matter cited in the HNEA, requesting written confirmation  from  the  HNGA  that  the  HNEA  is  closed,  and  notifying  the  HNEA  that,  in absence of confirmation, the installation shall deem the HNEA closed within sixty (60) days of  the  HNGA  receipt  of  the  letter.    (See  Attachment  3  for  sample  60-day  close  out correspondence) 4.2.3.1.  Installations  shall  consult  with  the  appropriate  IEF  and  the  appropriate  DoD Lead Environmental Component on the proper method to notify HNGA prior to sending a  60-day  closeout  letter  to  the  HNGA.    In  many  cases,  this  communication  must  be routed through  a host nation military agency  rather than being directly  addressed to  the HNGA.  Written notice (60-day closeout letter) is only sent after it is determined by the   20  AFI32-7047  22 JANUARY 2015 installation and the appropriate IEF that any necessary project has been fully developed to correct all violations associated with an HNEA, and funding for the project(s) has been allocated in  full.
