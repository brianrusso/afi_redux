Travel  expenses  for  all  DoD  personnel  should  be  paid  with  O&M  travel  per diem, unless otherwise approved by SAF/AA. 2.5.11.1.  ORF  may  be  used  to  pay  the  expenses  of  DoD  personnel  included  in  the official  party  who  participate  in  the  officially  hosted  meals  and  officially  hosted cultural activities.  Participation should be kept to the minimum number needed. 2.5.11.2.  DoD  personnel  must  claim  “meals  provided”  on  their  travel  vouchers  for any  ORF-funded  meals  received.    If  a  meal  is  not  provided,  “actual  expenses”  are claimed for all meals that day.   10 HOI65-3  12 OCTOBER 2017 2.5.11.3.  When an event is held in the NCR, DoD personnel not in a travel status do not receive per diem; therefore, some DoD personnel expenses may be paid by ORF if allowed by DoD  and USAF fiscal  and budget policy and approved in  advance by SAF/AA. 2.6.  CSAF-directed  Foreign  Engagement  Events:  Include  Operator  Engagement  Talks, Logistics-to-  Logistics  Talks,  Airman-to-Airman  Talks,  Air  Senior  National  Representative Meetings and F-16 Steering Committee and Executive Session Meetings. 2.6.1.  By  31  July  of  each  year,  the  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  for  each CSAF-directed  foreign  engagement  program/event,  submits  an  annual  engagement  plan and ORF budget for the next fiscal year for VCSAF and SAF/AA review and approval. 2.6.2.  The  OPR  submits  a  separate  ORF  request  and  obtains  VCSAF  and  SAF/AA approval  for  each  foreign  engagement  event.    Note:    ORF  will  cover  100%  of  the authorized cost of meals (to include meals, beverages and gratuities) and/or refreshments for the foreign national participants in foreign engagement events. ORF can be authorized to  cover  no  more  than  five  required  Air  Force  participants  at  any  one  of  these  events.  Any  ORF  payment  for  USAF  participants  will  cover  60%  of  the  overall  meal  cost  (to include meals, beverages and gratuities). The five Air Force attendees will be required to pay  the  40%  balance  of  the  overall  meal  cost.    Organizers  and  approval  authorities  for engagement meal events should continue to keep the number of Air Force participants to the minimum required to extend appropriate courtesies and hosting.  This reimbursement will  not  be  available  to  personnel  in  a  TDY  status.    Also,  absent  an  advance  written waiver from SAF/AA, any required USAF attendees above the five authorized above will have to pay for their own meals. 2.6.3.  Gift exchanges should ordinarily not be a part of these foreign engagement events.  If a gift exchange is contemplated, a request for a gift from the HAF Gift Locker should be  submitted  with  the  ORF  event  request  for  SAF/AA  approval.    When  approved, presentation of an ORF-funded gift should be limited to the head of the visiting foreign group.  The HAF Gift Locker Custodian is responsible for the selection and/or purchase of appropriate level gifts as may be needed. 2.7.  US  Dignitaries:  When  authorized  in  advance  by  SAF/AA  official  domestic  guests  as specified in AFI 65-603, paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3, may be extended official courtesies in the form  of  luncheons,  dinners,  receptions  and  participation  in  DoD-sponsored  events.

During  the  third  quarter  of  each  fiscal  year,  SAF/AAR,  through  SAF/AA,  issues  a request for the annual (fiscal year) HAF engagement plans for recurring ORF requests. 3.1.1.  A HAF organization with recurring ORF requests submits an annual engagement plan  and  proposed  budget  as  an  electronic  staff  summary  sheet  (e-SSS)  package  for approval(s) by 31 July of each year. 3.1.2.  SAF/GCA provides a legal and policy review; SAF/AAR provides a financial and policy review. HOI65-3  12 OCTOBER 2017 11 3.2.
