(T-2)  All projects modifying Air Force real property (e.g. carpet, wall coverings, painting, electrical outlet moves, etc) shall be approved by the BCE. (T-3) 4.1.4.  Trade  Shows.  This  program  presents  an  opportunity  each  year  for  installation  level managers  to  receive  direct  support  from  AFNAFPO  while  attending  various  trade  shows. Working in concert with our NPA vendors, special discounts are offered during these shows that  are  ordinarily  not  offered  during  any  other  time  of  the  year.    AFNAFPO  may  perform leverage buying in support of programs and installations during trade shows, i.e. Professional Golfers Association (PGA) Show; Hospitality Design Expo; National Restaurant Association (NRA) Show; Bowl Expo, etc. 4.1.5.  Consolidated Buys.  Consolidated buys create an opportunity for Services operations worldwide  to  participate  in  unique  purchasing  opportunities  by  consolidating  common requirements under one order issued by AFNAFPO.  Consolidated buys focus on generating volume  to  create  additional  discounts  from  the  NPA  pricing  program.    Golf  carts  and  ski equipment  are  a  few  examples  of  bulk  purchases  being  made  under  the  consolidated  buy initiative. 4.1.6.  Product  Bulletins.    This  program  works  very  successfully  for  our  NPA  contractors who  want  to  market  their  programs  aggressively  to  our  customer  base.    AFNAFPO  works with our trading partners to promote and market various products in their product line.  It is a simplified  process  distributed  via  product  bulletin  format  announcing  pricing  specials, closeouts, new products, and various other applications that complement our trading partners' AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 19 annual  marketing  strategy.    In  addition  to  distributing  these  bulletins  to  our  worldwide Services  customers,  AFNAFPO  posts  these  special  buying  opportunities  on  the  AFNAFPO websites. 20 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 Chapter 5 SERVICING CONTRACTING OFFICE (SCO) 5.1.  Contracting  Support.  The SCO must use the guidance and procedures of this manual  as the  method  of  contracting  in  support  of  local  NAF  requirements  to  the  fullest  extent  possible.  When  FAR  clauses  are  used  in  NAF  contracts,  the  Contracting  Officer  deletes  references  to “Government”  and  substitutes  “NAFI”.    The  SCO  provides  contracting  support  for  the following: 5.1.1.  Contracts that exceed NAF Contracting Officer purchasing authority. 5.1.2.  Nonpersonal  services  contracts  that  exceed  NAF  Contracting  Officer  purchasing authority  when  the  Service  Contract  Labor  Standards  Act  applies.

This  limitation  applies  to  requirements containing  goods  and  services  where  the  service  exceeds  the  NAF  Contracting  Officers warrant.    A  purchase  request  and  statement  of  work  are  provided  to  the  SCO  when establishing a nonpersonal service contract.  The value of a recurring services contract and or agreement is measured not by the amount of an individual award or call but by the total value of the award or calls when considered together. 5.1.3.  Construction  contracts  that  have  received  approval  through  the  civil  engineer  work order/requirements  review  board  process  and  exceed  NAF  Contracting  Officer  purchasing authority  when  the  Construction  Wage  Rate  Requirements  Statute  applies.

Limit  for  NAF  Contracting  Officer  is  $2,500 CONUS, up to the NAF Contracting Officer warrant overseas.  While many are zero dollar contracts,  it  is  the  total  monetary  value  of  the  relationship  that  determines  the  appropriate warrant  level  to  execute.    Prior  to  award/execution  of  any  concessionaire  contracts,  CE coordination is required to ensure compliance with utility provision and infrastructure codes. 5.1.5.  NAF  requirements  placed  against  APF  indefinite-delivery  contracts  where  cost effective. 5.1.6.  Special requests for contracting support or technical assistance. 5.1.7.

The SCO will obtain at least two repair cost estimates for aircraft repair from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) licensed aircraft repair firms.  (T-0)  The  solicitation  advises  offerors  that  no  award  is  made  if  it  is  determined  the  aircraft  is  not economical  to  repair  or  if  a  decision  is  made  to  accomplish  repairs  in-house.    The  SCO  will provide  the  repair  estimates,  including  price  and  terms  or  conditions,  to  the  local  aero  club AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 21 manager.

(T-2) 6.7.1.  Food purchases under resale.  Standard commercial practices concerning the purchase of food items apply to NAF purchasing.  Branding is a commonly accepted concept in food services.    Brand  name  food  items  may  be  purchased  without  further  competition  and established  as  standard  presentations  (e.g.,  core  menus  and  core  recipes)  within  food operations.    Food  items  in  general  (whether  they  are  directly  provided  to  the  consumer  or they are part of the recipe) may be considered items for resale; however, competition may be in  the  best  interest  of  the  NAFI  in  certain  cases.    Price  reasonableness  must  be  determined when purchases are made outside the NAF Prime Vendor program.  Eighty percent (80%) of NAFI  food  purchases  must  be  purchased  from  the  respective  Prime  Vendor  in  the  region.  The  80%  is  calculated  using  the  total  purchases  for  the  NAF  FSS  food  and  beverage operations. 6.7.2.  Rental  item  purchases  without  competition.    The  decision  to  purchase  brand  name items for rental without competition is made by the Contracting Officer in coordination with the requesting activity.  Contracting Officers are required to seek competition for rental items not driven by brand name preference only if it is in the best interest of the NAFI. (T-2) 6.7.3.  Items that generate revenue by virtue of their function, such as amusement machines, vending  machines,  and  bingo  prizes  may  be  purchased  without  competition.    When competition is not obtained, the Contracting Officer will determine price reasonableness and include this determination in the contract file and attach it in the NAF electronic purchasing system. (T-2) 24 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 6.8.  Brand  Name  and  Sole  Source.  Brand  Name  is  used  when  only  one  particular manufacturer’s product, and not a substitution or equivalent, meets the essential requirements of the  NAFI.    Requirements  are  generally  based  on  customer  preference  and/or  demand.    Sole Source implies that there is only one person or company that can provide the contractual services needed  and  that  any  attempt  to  obtain  proposals  would  only  result  in  one  person  or  company being  available  to  meet  the  need.    Contracting  Officers  must  receive  written  justification  for brand  name  and  sole  source  purchases  from  the  requesting  activity  along  with  the  purchase request.  (T-2)  Contracting Officers will ensure the justification states what  specific or unusual need makes the required brand name product(s)/sole source necessary. (T-2)  Personal preference is  not  sufficient  justification  for  a  sole  source  purchase.    The  Contracting  Officer  determines whether there is  sufficient  justification to  purchase the brand name or from  the sole source.  A brand name only purchase may be competed to determine if the item can be procured at various discounts  from  the  manufacturer  or  from  authorized  distributors.    Sole  source  requests  may  be validated  by  publicizing  the  requirement.   The  Contracting  Officer  determines  price reasonableness and includes the determination in the contracting file. 6.9.  Brand  Name  or  Equal.  The  brand  name  or  equal  method  is  another  procedure  for describing a requirement.  The purchase description should set forth those salient characteristics of  the  brand  name  product  that  are  essential  to  the  needs  of  the  NAFI.    The  make  or  model number or other appropriate nomenclature and all other known acceptable brand name products, should be listed as a part of the description.  The Contracting Officer shall require the offerors to submit information that establishes that the product offered meets the NAFI requirement.  Brand name  or  equal  procurements  are  not  accomplished  on  a  sole-source  basis.  (T-2)    Therefore,  no justification or approval is needed other than documentation in the file showing that competition was sought, and a determination of fair and reasonable pricing was made, with subsequent award of the contract. 6.10.  Determination of Responsibility.  Before award of any contract, the Contracting Officer must  determine  the  responsibility  of  the  firm  that  is  being  considered  for  award.    Contracting Officers will use the standards listed below as a guide in  determining contractor responsibility. (T-2)  To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must demonstrate they: 6.10.1.  Have  adequate  financial  resources  to  perform  the  contract,  or  the  ability  to  obtain them. (T-0) 6.10.2.  Are able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule. (T-2) 6.10.3.  Have a satisfactory performance record. (T-2) 6.10.4.  Have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics. (T-2) 6.10.5.  Have  the  necessary  organization,  experience,  accounting  and  operational  controls, and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them. (T-2) 6.10.6.  Have the necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities, or the ability to obtain them. (T-2) 6.10.7.  Are  not  presently  suspended  or  debarred  from  government-wide  procurement  (See excluded parties list at www.sam.gov). (T-2) AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 25 6.11.  Design  Inclusion Provision.  A firm that designs or specifies projects (or its subsidiaries or  affiliates)  cannot  compete  for  a  contract  to  provide  items  for  that  project.    This  is  not  to  be confused with a competed design build contract. 6.12.  Performance Period of NAF Contracts or Agreements.  Contracts subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards Act are restricted to 5 years.  Maximum time for contracts not subject to  the  Service  Contract  Labor  Standards  Act  is  limited  to  10  years.    Contracting  Officers  will ensure  that  Blanket  Purchase  Agreements  (BPAs)  and  Nonappropriated  Fund  Purchase Agreements (NPAs) state the beginning and ending dates of the basic period.  (T-2)  BPAs and NPAs  may  include  option  periods  to  extend  their  duration;  however,  they  cannot  exceed  ten years.    For  AFNAFPO  issued  contracts  that  exceed  10  years,  the  Contracting  Officer  must provide  a  written  determination  that  demonstrates  the  extended  performance  is  in  the  best interest of the NAFI and be approved by the Director of NAF Purchasing. (T-2) 6.13.  Purchase  of  Hazardous  Materials.  Contracting  Officers  will  ensure  that  awards  which include  the  purchase  of  hazardous  materials  include  the  FAR  clause  52.223-3,  Hazardous Material Safety Data, by reference or in full text. (T-2)  Contracting Officers will ensure orders identify where safety hazardous sheets should be submitted. (T-2)  Requester will ensure that all purchases  of  hazardous  material  are  coordinated  in  advance  with  the  Hazardous  Materials Pharmacy and the Contracting Officer will ensure the coordination is documented in the file (see AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management). (T-2)  Awards which include hazardous waste removal must require that removal be conducted IAW the installations’ HAZWASTE plans. (T-1) 6.14.  Information  Technology  Coordination.  All  AFNAFPO  awards for  Automated Information Systems (AISs), and Information Technology (IT) equipment and services must be coordinated through the Air Force Services Activity, Directorate of Systems prior to award. (T-2)    Installation-level  requirements  for  AIS  and  IT  will  be  coordinated  with  the  supporting Communications  Directorate  or  Communications  Squadron  prior  to  submittal  to  contracting  to ensure compliance with Air Force IT criteria and standards. (T-2) 6.15.  NAF  Vehicles.  All  NAF  vehicles  for  CONUS  installations  must  be  purchased  by AFNAFPO  unless  a  waiver  has  been  approved  in  advance  by  AFNAFPO  for  local  purchase through  the  installation  SCO.    For  OCONUS  installations,  because  of  the  unique  vehicle requirements,  NAFIs  may  utilize  the  local  SCO  to  make  vehicle  purchases  on  their  behalf without  requesting  a  waiver  from  AFNAFPO.    However,  all  requirements  outlined  in  AFI  34-204,  Property  Management,  Chapter  6,  must  be  complied  with  before  any  vehicles  can  be purchased, either CONUS or OCONUS. 26 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 Chapter 7 PURCHASE REQUEST (PR) 7.1.  PR Guidance.  Contracting Officers shall ensure purchase requests as a minimum identify the  requesting  NAFI  (e.g.,  Offutt  AFB  Morale  Welfare  &  Recreation  (MWR)  fund),  the requirement, and requested delivery date. (T-2)  PRs must be submitted with a realistic delivery schedule  and  the  appropriate  requirement  documents  (i.e.  performance  work  statement  (PWS),  statement of work (SOW), Independent Government Estimate (IGE), market research, suggested sources, BCE coordination. (T-2) 7.2.  Numbering PRs.  Numbering of PRs should be configured to identify base name, branch of service, fiscal year, and a unique number that identifies the particular PR.  Contracting Officers shall  ensure  the  PR  numbers  are  compatible  with  NAF  electronic  purchasing  system.  (T-2)  Exception will be a base SCO generated PR number. 7.2.1.  Purchase  Request  Register.    A  register  for  purchase  requests  and  resulting  purchase orders is maintained electronically in the NAF electronic purchasing system.  If the electronic purchasing  system  is  not  available,  Contracting  Officers  shall  ensure  a  manual  register  is maintained until the system becomes available and is updated with the information. (T-2) 7.2.2.  Funds  Availability.    Contracting  Officers  shall  ensure  all  purchase  requests  contain certification of  funds availability (signed by  an individual  with  fund  certification authority) before purchasing action is initiated. (T-2) 7.2.3.  Distribution  of  Purchase  Requests.    The  preferred  method  of  distribution  is  through the NAF electronic purchasing system. 7.3.  Green Procurement.  Contracting Officers will ensure all purchase requests for non-resale products or services includes written statement from the requisitioner that  requirements comply with  the  Green  Procurement  Program.  (T-2)    Training  on  green  procurement  is  available  at Defense Acquisition University. 7.4.  Authorization  of  Additional  Funds  against  Original  PRs.  Any  contracting  action (modifications,  claims,  equitable  adjustments,  etc.)  that  requires  more  funds  than  originally authorized cannot be executed without certification that funds are available. AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 27 Chapter 8 SOLICITATIONS AND AWARD 8.1.  Solicitations.  Contracting  Officers  will  provide  any  information  that  would  be  necessary for  the  preparation  of  proposals  to  all  prospective  offerors  in  the  bidding  process  in  order  to avoid creating an unfair competitive advantage. (T-2)  Written solicitations may be structured as a  request  for  quotation  (RFQ)  or  a  request  for  proposal  (RFP).    Responses  to  RFQs  are  not binding  on  the  offeror.    The  Contracting  Officer  will  issue  an  RFP  when  a  binding  offer  is needed and bears the signature or electronic certification of an official in the company authorized to  commit the firm.  (T-2)  The offer becomes a  binding contract  when accepted  and signed by the  Contracting  Officer.    Solicitations  may  be  transmitted  and  received  electronically  and  have the same binding effect as a written solicitation.  The NAF electronic purchasing system, which is  located  at  www.afnafpo.com  provides  necessary  formats  to  forward  to  prospective  offerors electronically or manually. 8.1.1.  Contracting  Officers  will  use  written  solicitations  for  open  market  purchases exceeding $150,000. (T-2) 8.1.2.  Change in NAFI requirements.  If there are changes in the requirement before or after receipt of quotations or proposals, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of the change.  If  the  quotations  or  proposals  are  not  yet  due,  an  amendment  will  be  sent  to  all  firms  that received  the  solicitation.    If  the  deadline  for  quotations  or  proposals  has  passed,  send  the amendment only to those firms that responded.  The Contracting Officer will make a written determination  if  the  changes  are  significant  enough  to  warrant  canceling  the  entire solicitation and resoliciting. (T-2) 8.2.  Synopsis.  Synopsis  is  not  a  requirement  for  NAF  purchases.    However,  the  AFNAFPO Contracting Officer may synopsize requirements when it is determined to be in the best interest of the NAFI only after obtaining written approval from the Director of AF NAF Purchasing.  If synopsis is deemed appropriate, the Contracting Officer will use the Government-wide Point of Entry  system  and  determines  the  length  of  time  for  publicizing  NAF  requirements.  (T-2)  Contracting  Officers  will  ensure  solicitation  and  contract  award  notices  for  synopsized  NAF purchases include the following as the last part  of the notice to  be published (T-2):  “This  is  a nonappropriated fund purchase and it does not obligate appropriated funds of the United States Government.  Nonappropriated funds are generated by the military community through the sale of  goods  and  services  and  the  collection  of  fees  and  charges  for  participation  in  military community  programs.    This  purchase  does  not  involve  federal  tax  dollars.”    Contract  award notices  are  not  a  mandatory  requirement  for  NAF  purchases.    However,  AFNAFPO  will  send written  notification  to  all  unsuccessful  offerors  that  outlines  their  right  to  request  a  debriefing IAW para 8.4 below. (T-2) 8.3.  Source  Selection  (Applies  to  AFNAFPO  Only).  Source  selections  require  written proposals.  Contract award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to  the  NAFI.  (T-0)    The  source  selection  approach  and  evaluation  factors  are  specific  to  each acquisition  and  the  Contracting  Officer  will  ensure  they  are  identified  in  the  solicitation.  (T-2)  An acquisition strategy is developed prior to the drafting of the solicitation to determine the most effective  source  selection  approach  for  the  requirement,  to  establish  evaluation  criteria,  to 28 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 identify the source selection evaluation team evaluating proposals, and develop the documents to support  the  Source  Selection  Authority  (SSA)  decision.    The  SSA  will  determine  if  a  formal acquisition plan is required.  Contracting Officers will ensure solicitations inform offerors of the format required for the submission of a proposal  and will elicit from offerors only the material needed to fairly evaluate offers. (T-2)  Contracting Officers will use, at minimum, cost and past performance  as  evaluation  factors.  (T-2)    Poor  past  performance  ratings  may  disqualify  an offeror from receiving an award.  Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as  terms  and  conditions,  representations  and  certifications,  and  technical  requirements,  in addition  to  those  identified  as  evaluation  factors  or  subfactors.  (T-2)    Failure  to  meet  a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award.  Contracting Officers will require non-disclosure  agreements  from  source  selection  team  members  during  the  source  selection process.  (T-2)    The  Director  of  AF  NAF  Purchasing,  or  designee,  is  the  SSA.    The  SSA  is responsible  for  the  proper  and  efficient  conduct  of  the  entire  source  selection  process encompassing proposal solicitation, evaluation, selection, and contract award. 8.3.1.  When  using  source  selection  procedures,  the  Contracting  Officer  will  identify  the evaluation  factors in  the solicitation with their order of importance in  selecting  an offer for award. (T-2) 8.3.2.  The Contracting Officer will document the source selection decision with the rationale for making award to a particular contractor. (T-2) 8.4.  Debriefings.  An  offeror,  upon  its  written  request  received  by  the  agency  within  3  days after  the  date  on  which  that  offeror  received  notification  of  contract  award,  shall  be  promptly debriefed and furnished the basis for the selection decision and contract award.  The Contracting Officer will ensure the debriefing does not include point-by-point comparisons of the debriefed offeror’s  proposal  with  those  of  other  offerors  and  is  not  a  forum  for  debate  regarding  the subjective judgment of the SSA and shall not reveal any information exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act or other applicable law or regulation. (T-0)  At a minimum, the debriefing information should include: 8.4.1.  The  Government’s  evaluation  of  the  significant  weaknesses  or  deficiencies  in  the offeror’s proposal, if applicable. 8.4.2.  The  overall  evaluated  cost  or  price  (including  unit  prices),  and  technical  rating,  if applicable,  of  the  successful  offeror  and  the  debriefed  offeror,  and  past  performance information on the debriefed offeror. 8.4.3.  The  overall  ranking  of  all  offerors,  when  any  ranking  was  developed  by  the  agency during the source selection. 8.4.4.  A summary of the rationale for award. 8.4.5.  For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. 8.4.6.  Reasonable responses to relevant questions about whether source selection procedures contained  in  the  solicitation,  applicable  regulations,  and  other  applicable  authorities  were followed. 8.5.  Pricing  Summaries  and  Price  Negotiation  Memorandums  (PNM).  After the receipt of offers, the Contracting Officer may make an award based on the initial quotations/proposals, or AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 29 conduct  negotiations.    The  Contracting  Officer  will  ensure  that  discussions,  if  held,  are conducted openly and fairly without affording any offeror a competitive advantage and that the discussions are documented in the PNM. (T-2)  The Contracting Officer will prepare a PNM or pricing summary to document the price analysis and to establish the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed pricing.  (T-2)  When price reasonableness  is  based upon  adequate  competition (two  or  more  technically  acceptable  offers),  no  further  supporting  documentation  is  needed.  When only one offer is  received or found to  be  technically  acceptable, the Contracting  Officer will include in the file documents that support the reasonableness of the offer (i.e. price catalog references,  price  lists,  previous  prices  for  similar  goods  or  services,  a  brief  statement  of  facts regarding  the  anticipation  of  competition,  or  other  documents.).  (T-2)    Price  reasonableness addresses the issue of whether the offered price is too high and may be determined based on one or more of the following considerations: market research, comparison with previous competitive purchase  of  same  or  similar  item,  current  catalog/published  price  list/advertisement,  buyer’s personal knowledge of item. 8.6.  Award Types. 8.6.1.  Purchase  Orders  (PO).    POs  are  offers  to  buy  items  on  the  open  market  at  specified prices and other terms and conditions.  POs are binding when the firm accepts the offer either by  signing  the  order  or  initiating  performance.    Use  the  template  provided  in  the  NAF electronic  purchasing  system.  If  automated  ordering  is  not  available,  then  utilize  the, Nonappropriated Fund Order for Supplies or Services, available on the AFNAFPO website.  Commercial  vendor  literature,  business  agreements  and  licenses  may  be  attached  as  part  of the order; however, the Contracting Officer will ensure commercial business agreements are reviewed by the local SJA/Contract Attorney prior to including them in any order or contract. (T-2)  Contracting Officers will add the NAF General Provisions to all open market purchase orders. (T-2) 8.6.2.  Confirmation  Orders.    Orders  may  be  issued  orally  with  follow-on  written  orders confirming the oral requirements.  Contracting Officers will ensure the written order contains the date and individual with whom the verbal order was placed. (T-2)  Confirmation Orders should be used only in an emergency situation.  See paragraph 3.12. 8.6.3.  POs  Outside  the  United  States.    In  the  event  of  inconsistency  in  the  translation between  terms  of  a  contract  written  outside  the  United  States,  the  English  definition  takes precedence. 8.6.4.  Delivery  Orders  (DO).    A  DO  is  an  order  written  against  an  existing  contract  or agreement.  Terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  basic  contract  apply  to  delivery  orders issued. 8.7.  Numbering of Contracts/Orders.  Contracting Officers will ensure the numbering system is  consistent  with  the  NAF  electronic  purchasing  systems  to  provide  an  audit  trail  of contracts/orders issued against individual purchase requests. (T-2)  Contracts or Orders issued by the SCO will be consistent with the SCO numbering system. (T-2) 8.8.  Clauses  and  Certifications.  Contracting  Officers  will  ensure  contracts,  orders,  and agreements funded exclusively with NAFs contain only those clauses and certifications required for the purpose of complying with Federal law, DoD requirements, and protecting the interests of the NAFI. (T-2)  The NAF electronic purchasing system contains the approved contract formats 30 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 and  general  provisions  to  be  used  for  NAF  purchases.    Any  deviations  including  the incorporation  of  proposed  contractor  clauses,  commercial  literature,  business  agreements  and licenses may be incorporated as part of NAF contracts and orders providing they do not conflict with  a  federal  requirement  or  immunity.    Contracting  Officers  will  obtain  a  legal  review  when any of the aforementioned documents are proposed to be incorporated into NAF contracts. (T-2) 8.9.  Payment Terms.  Contracting Officers will specify payment terms on orders/contracts. (T-2)    The  Contracting  Officer  may  choose  from  the  payment  terms  available  in  the  electronic purchasing systems.  Deviations must be approved by AFNAFPO. 8.10.  Contract  Approvals.  Within  AFNAFPO,  a  contract  review  committee  will  review solicitations estimated to exceed $150,000 to ensure all actions comply with the applicable rules and  regulations,  including  this  manual  and  AFNAFPO  Office  Instructions  (OIs).  (T-2)    The following actions are taken by AFNAFPO during the review process: 8.10.1.  The  Director  of  AFNAF  Purchasing,  or  designee,  will  administratively  review solicitations  and  contracts,  exceeding  $150,000.  (T-2)    This  includes  amendments  and modifications that affect price and scope, excluding those that are administrative in nature. 8.10.2.  AFNAFPO  Contracting  Officer  will  obtain  a  legal  review  for  solicitations  and contracts/agreements and amendments or modifications exceeding $150,000. (T-2) 8.10.3.  Contracts,  agreements  and  amendments  or  modifications  that  exceed  $500,000 require  approval  by  the  Director  of  AFNAF  Purchasing,  or  designee.    The  Director  of AFNAF  Purchasing,  or  designee,  will  review  and  approve  any  contract  or  agreement awarded  as  a  result  of  the  competitive  proposal  process  through  Request  for  Proposal  and Source Selection. (T-2) 8.10.4.  The  Director  of  AFNAF  Purchasing,  or  designee,  and  legal  will  review  all termination actions, including cure notices, show cause notices, notices of terminations and termination settlement agreements. 8.11.  Base  SCO  Contract  Approvals.  All  solicitations,  contract,  amendments  and modifications executed by the Base SCO will be administered by the Base SCO. AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 31 Chapter 9 NAF PURCHASE CARD (P-CARD) 9.1.  Introduction.  The  NAF  P-Card  is  used  to  make  purchases  for  official  government  use.  The purchasing thresholds for the card are determined by AFNAFPO.  The NAF P-Card is  the preferred method of acquiring standard commercial items within the dollar thresholds set forth in this manual.  All cardholders shall be familiar with the requirements of this manual, AFI 34-275, and other instructions pertaining to the NAF P-Card Program. (T-2) 9.2.  Dollar  Limitations/Restrictions.  The  RM  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  execution  of purchasing  transactions  to  ensure  they  do  not  exceed  the  individual  cardholder’s  dollar limitations  and  that  the  card  is  being  used  only  for  authorized  government  transactions.    The limitations  set  at  installation  level  cannot  exceed  the  overall  thresholds  established  by AFNAFPO. 9.2.1.  The NAF P-Card card may be used to purchase supplies, equipment, and non-personal services.  Individual transactions may not exceed $5,000 except as follows: 9.2.1.1.  For purchases from the Commissary, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), Naval Exchange Service (NEX), Prime Vendor, and printing services from the Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS), the limit is $25,000 per transaction. 9.2.1.2.  Cardholder  accounts  may  be  established  by  training  and  education  program managers with a single purchase limit up to $25,000.  The NAF P-Card does not replace the  SF  182,  Request,  Authorization  Agreement,  Certification  of  Training  and Reimbursement. 9.2.2.  NAF  Contracting  Officers  may  specify  the  NAF  P-Card  as  a  method  of  payment  on agreements,  purchase  and  delivery  orders,  and  contracts  up  to  the  limit  of  their  warrant authority.      The  Contracting  Officer  can  specify  any  NAF  P-Card  cardholder  at  their installation,  except  themselves,  as  the  payer.    Card  limits  can  be  adjusted  by  the  local  card approving authority to meet mission needs and maximize use of the NAF P-card. 9.2.3.  Cardholders shall not use the NAF P-Card for the following: (T-0) 9.2.3.1.  Personal Purchases. 9.2.3.2.  Use as a travel card for official government travel. 9.2.3.3.  Cash Advances. 9.2.3.4.  Rental or lease of land or buildings. 9.2.3.5.  Purchase  of  hazardous/dangerous  items  such  as  explosives,  toxins.    Exception:  The  purchase  of  ammunition  and  firearms  used  for  resale  in  Rod  &  Gun  Clubs  or  on skeet  ranges  is  authorized  if  proper  purchase  authorization  is  obtained  from  applicable base, local, state and/or federal agencies. 9.2.3.6.  Items designated for purchase with APFs. 9.2.3.7.  Purchase any goods or services requiring modification to Air Force real property without BCP approval. (T-3) 32 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 65-107,  Nonappropriated  Funds  Financial  Management  Oversight 9.2.4.  AFI Responsibilities, requires the Nonappropriated Fund Financial Analyst (NAFFA) conduct an annual review of the NAF P-Card program. AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 33 Chapter 10 BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (BPA) AND BLANKET DELIVERY ORDERS (BDO) 10.1.  BPAs.  BPAs provide a method of purchasing supplies and services on a recurring basis on the  open  market  when  the  use  of  the  NAF  P-Card  card  is  not  practicable.    NAF  Contracting Officers negotiate BPAs.  A PR is not required to create a BPA for resale.  Contracting Officers will accomplish BPAs by using the templates provided in the NAF Electronic Purchasing System and will include the NAF General Provisions. (T-2)  NAF Special Provisions are also added on BPAs for perishable items.  Contracting Officers will ensure the BPA numbering is compatible with  the  NAF  electronic  purchasing  system.  (T-2)    Contracting  Officers  will  ensure  the agreement  contains  as  a  minimum:  pricing,  identification  of  items  covered,  delivery  terms, Contracting  Officer’s  signature,  dollar  call  limitations,  individuals  or  positions  authorized  to place calls against the BPA, and mandatory clauses identified in this manual, i.e., NAF General Provisions and Special Provisions. (T-2) 10.1.1.  Description of Agreement.  A statement that requires the supplier to furnish supplies or services, described in general terms, if and when requested by the Contracting Officer (or the  authorized  representatives  of  the  Contracting  Officer)  during  a  specified  period  and within a stipulated aggregate amount, if any.  BPAs should be for a basic period of one year.  Option years cannot exceed nine year(s), so that the total duration of this agreement does not exceed ten years from the date of its inception. 10.1.2.  Extent  of  the  Obligation.    A  statement  that  NAF  is  obligated  only  to  the  extent  of authorized purchases actually made under the BPA. 10.1.3.  Purchase  Limitation.    A  statement  that  specifies  the  dollar  limitation  for  each individual under the BPA. 10.1.4.  Individuals  Authorized  to  Purchase  Under  the  BPA.    The  Contracting  Officer  will furnish to the supplier a statement with a list of individuals authorized to purchase under the BPA identified either by title of position or by name of individual, organizational component, and the dollar limitation per purchase for each title or individual. (T-2) 10.1.5.  Delivery  Tickets.    The  Contracting  Officer  will  include  a  requirement  that  all shipments  under  the  agreement,  except  those  for  newspapers,  magazines,  or  other periodicals,  are  accompanied  by  delivery  tickets  or  sales  slips  that  contain  the  following minimum information: (T-2) 10.1.5.1.  Name of supplier 10.1.5.2.  BPA number 10.1.5.3.  Date of purchase 10.1.5.4.  Purchase number 10.1.5.5.  Itemized list of supplies or services furnished. 34 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 10.1.5.6.  Quantity,  unit  price,  extension  of  each  item,  less  applicable  discounts  (unit prices and extensions need not be reflected with the use of automated systems, provided the invoice is itemized.) 10.2.  Prepriced  and  Unpriced  BPAs.  The Contracting Officer is  responsible for determining whether a prepriced or unpriced BPA should be established.  Products or services that fluctuate in price on a frequent basis are usually established as an unpriced BPA.  The Contracting Officer should attempt to ensure adequate competition is available when establishing sources that qualify for BPAs. 10.2.1.  The Contracting  Officer shall approve price lists or negotiate  firm  fixed pricing for prepriced BPAs. (T-1)  The Contracting Officer will ensure the approved price lists contain the effective dates, and a copy is maintained with the BPA. (T-2) 10.2.2.  Distribution.    The  Contracting  Officer  will  ensure  copies  of  the  price  list  or negotiated prices for services are dated and distributed to the applicable activities. (T-2)  The activities shall not solicit additional pricing discounts against the pre-negotiated prices. (T-2)  However, voluntary price reductions are acceptable if offered by the contractor. 10.2.3.  Items  not  covered  by  the  BPA  are  not  eligible  for  purchases  under  the  BPA.  Requirements  for  these  items  should  be  referred  to  the  Contracting  Officer  for  inclusion under the BPA. 10.2.4.  Documenting Calls.  Calls against BPAs should be documented by the activity using the  Call  Register  located  in  the  NAF  electronic  purchasing  system.    Other  controls  may  be established  by  the  Contracting  Officer  as  necessary.    Sales  slips,  invoices,  delivery  tickets, and  other  commonly  accepted  documents  may  be  used  by  the  activity  to  verify  receipt  of goods.  Discrepancies  are  noted.    Authorized  BPA  Callers  ensure  call  registers  are documented in NAF electronic purchasing system. 10.2.5.  Administration  of  BPA  Calls.    The  activity  that  placed  the  call  is  responsible  for follow-up  action  as  it  relates  to  delivery,  cancellation,  and  other  related  matters.    Problems that cannot be resolved are referred to the Contracting Officer. 10.2.6.  Payment.    Consolidated  payments  are  made  on  a  monthly  basis.    The  specific  time and conditions of payment are established within the terms of the BPA.  Contracting Officers will ensure BPAs for commodities subject to accelerated payment under the Prompt Payment Act contain appropriate payment provisions. (T-0) 10.3.  BDOs.  A  BDO  provides  a  way  of  ordering  undetermined  quantities  of  supplies  and services through prepriced contracts using the call process similar to a BPA.  A PR is required to create  a  BDO.    The  total  estimated  dollar  amount  to  be  used  during  the  specified  time  is identified on the order.  The BDO is created against an existing contract using a purchase order form. 10.3.1.  The  order  should  specify  a  time  frame  in  which  calls  are  valid  against  the  BDO.  However,  the  performance  period  of  the  BDO  has  to  fall  within  the  performance  period  of the source contract. 10.3.2.  The Contracting Officer shall provide the contractor a list of individuals or position titles authorized to place calls against the BDO and maximum call limitations. (T-2)  BDOs AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 35 are  accomplished  by  using  the  same  format  as  delivery  orders.    BDO  numbering  will  be compatible with the NAF electronic purchasing system. (T-2) 10.3.3.  Documenting Calls.  Calls against BDOs should be documented by the activity using the  Call  Register  located  in  the  NAF  electronic  purchasing  system.    Other  controls  may  be established  by  the  Contracting  Officer  as  necessary.    Sales  slips,  invoices,  delivery  tickets, and  other  commonly  accepted  documents  may  be  used  by  the  activity  to  verify  receipt  of goods. Discrepancies are noted.  Documentation is forwarded to the appropriate paying office to support payment. 10.3.4.  Administration  of  BDO  Calls.    The  activity  that  placed  the  call  is  responsible  for follow-up  action  as  it  relates  to  delivery,  cancellation,  and  other  related  matters.    Problems that cannot be resolved are referred to the Contracting Officer. 10.3.5.  Payment.    Consolidated  payments  are  made  on  a  monthly  basis.    The  specific  time and conditions of payment are established within the terms of the BPA.  Contracting Officers will ensure BPAs for commodities subject to accelerated payment under the Prompt Payment Act (meat, perishables, etc.) contain appropriate payment provisions. (T-0) 10.4.  Reviews.  The Contracting Officer  will perform an  annual  review  of BPAs and  BDOs to monitor compliance and to determine if continuance of the agreement is warranted. (T-2) 36 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 Chapter 11 SPECIAL TYPE CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS electronic purchasing 11.1.  Formats.  Formats  for  all  special  NAF  contracts  and  agreements  are  maintained  in  the NAF website: https://www.afnafpo.afsv.net.    Apply  the  guidance  on  the  special  contracts  and  agreements discussed in this chapter.  Contracting Officers will obtain legal review when a change is made to any of the contract templates.  DO NOT include the contractor social security number as a part of  the  contract  or  store  in  the  NAF  electronic  purchasing  system.    The  Privacy  Act  precludes open access to certain information such as social security numbers. (T-0) AFNAFPO the system and on 11.2.  Entertainment  Contracts.  Commercial into noncompetitively.    Contracting  with  booking  agents  utilizes  the  same  format  prescribed  for contracting directly with entertainment acts. Legal review must be obtained for contracts entered into with an agent. entertainment  may entered be 11.3.  Aircraft  Lease  Agreement.  The  Aero  Club  cannot  operate  the  leased  aircraft  until written  approval  is  obtained  from  AFSVA/SVPC.    When  approval  has  been  obtained,  the Contracting Officer will submit a copy of the completed lease agreement to AFSVA/SVPC for inclusion in the Air Force Insurance Program. (T-2)  Extension of leases should be forwarded to AFSVA/SVPC. 11.4.  Aero  Club  Instructor  and  Mechanic  Contracts.  These  contracts  include  flight  and ground  instructors,  aircraft  and  power  plant  (A&P)  mechanics,  and  inspection  authorization inspectors.  These contracts may be entered into noncompetitively and paid on an hourly basis. (ISC).  These  contracts  may  be  entered into 11.5.  Individual  Service  Contracts noncompetitively.    Insurance  should  be  considered  where  unique  risks  are  associated  with  the services to be performed.  These contracts are awarded to specified individuals for their unique skills,  experience,  or  knowledge  in  performing  a  service  for  the  NAFI.    Consider  the  Twenty Common  Law  Factors  in  Attachment  2  to  determine  whether  an  employer-employee relationship results.  Contracts for individual services to a Federal agency are generally exempt from the requirements of the Service Contract Act. 11.5.1.  The  Contracting  Officers  will  ensure  the  ISC  meets,  as  a  minimum,  the  following criteria: 11.5.1.1.  Only the individual specified on the contract performs the service.  Substitutes and/or assistants are not allowed. 11.5.1.2.  Payment should be based on a fixed amount or per job basis.  Do not pay on a per  hour  basis  or  specify  a  percentage  of  the  fees  (except  as  authorized  in  paragraph 11.4). 11.5.1.3.  The ISC cannot exceed one year. 11.5.1.4.  The  ISC must not  create an employer/employee relationship  (e.g., supervision by a government employee). 11.5.2.  Rights, benefits, and privileges that NAFI payroll employees accrue do not apply to a person who furnishes services under an ISC. AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 37 11.5.3.  Do not use ISCs in the following situations: 11.5.3.1.  For services that the individual is obligated to provide the NAFI as a result of his or her military or civilian employee position. 11.5.3.2.  For construction services. 11.5.3.3.  For services by  an  employee of the  activity where performance of the service would  create  a  conflict  of  interest.    Consult  with  the  base  legal  office  for  conflict  of interest issues. 11.6.  Nonpersonal  Services.  A  nonpersonal  service  contract  is  negotiated  with  a  contractor (individual, corporation, etc.) for services that do not require unique skills and the individual or individuals  performing  the  service  are  not  specified  within  the  performance  work  statement  of the contract.  The Service Contract Labor Standards Act may apply to nonpersonal services (see paragraph  3.4.3).    For  service  contracts  that  do  not  exceed  $2,500,  the  contractor  must  pay  its employees at least minimum wage. (T-0)  Service contracts that exceed $2,500 may require wage rate  determinations  for  various  types  of  service  employees.    Therefore,  service  requirements greater than $2,500 in the aggregate are forwarded to the local Servicing Contracting Office for purchase.  The purchase request form and the statement of work are provided to the SCO when establishing nonpersonal service contracts. 11.7.  Consignment  Contract,  Charter  Flight/Tour  Desk  Concessionaire  Contract,  and Ticket  Consignment  Agreement.  Contracting  Officers  will  obtain  a  legal  review  if  the prescribed format is changed on any of these contracts. (T-2) 11.8.  Concessionaire  Contract.  One  level  above  the  FSS  Commander  (or  equivalent)  must approve  concessionaire  contracts.  (T-2)  (See  AFI  34-101,  Air  Force  Morale,  Welfare,  and Recreation  (MWR)  Programs  and  Use  Eligibility,  paragraph  2.5,  for  additional  guidance.)  Concessionaire contracts stipulate a fixed return to the NAFI or provide for a percentage of the income.    The  gross  amount  (includes  income  of  both  the  NAFI  and  contractor)  is  used  in determining  the  contract  amount.   Contracting  Officers  shall  obtain  advance  approval  from  the appropriate  AFSVA  Program  Manager  before  awarding  a  contract  to  operate  any  services activities,  or  any  part  thereof.  (T-2)    All  modifications  to  Air  Force  real  property  to  meet concessionaire contract operations shall have BCE approval. (T-3) 11.9.  Contracting  for  Training  and  Education.  When  NAFs  are  authorized  to  contract  for vocational  training  and  part-time  college  level  education  of  NAF  personnel,  compete  training and  education  needs  in  excess  of  $25,000  among  commercial  firms  or  educational  institutions, unless a sole source justification is included in the contract file. 11.10.  Contracts with Government Employees.  Contracts or lease agreements are authorized with  military  personnel,  government  employees,  or  business  organizations  substantially  owned or  controlled  by  government  employees,  when  such  contracts  or  leases  are  funded  solely  with NAFs.    However,  Contracting  Officers  will  obtain  a  legal  review  prior  to  the  execution  of  any such contracts or agreements. (T-2) 11.11.  Donations.  NAF contracts funded completely with donations do not require competition if the donor specifies the source to be used. 11.12.  Purchasing  of  Advertising.  See  AFI  34-108,  Commercial  Sponsorship  and  Sale  of Advertising. 38 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 11.13.  Public-Private  Ventures (PPV).  PPV  contracts/agreements  are  considered  as alternative  methods  of  satisfying  capital  requirements  in  excess  of  $1  million  for  Category  C MWR  activities.    PPV  arrangements  may  be  used  to  provide  only  those  services  and  activities that are within the mission and scope of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) programs as authorized  in  DoDI  1015.13,  Department  of  Defense  Procedures  for  Implementing  Public-Private  Ventures  (PPV)  for  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation  (MWR),  and  Armed  Services Exchange  Category  C  Revenue-Generating  Activities.    MWR  services  and  activities  provided through  PPV  arrangements  are  limited  to  authorized  patrons  (AFI  34-101,  AF  MWR  Programs and Use Eligibility). AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 39 Chapter 12 CONTACT ADMINISTRATION 12.1.  Contract  Administration.  Contract  administration  covers  actions  necessary  to  ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the order or contract.  It includes, but is not limited to  monitoring  contractor  compliance  and  the  resolution  of  problems  associated  with  shipments (lost  or  damaged  goods),  processing  claims,  payments,  modifications  and  terminations.    A contract  generally  is  considered  to  be  completed  when  final  payment  has  been  made  under  the contract.  Contracting Officers will not modify expired contracts. (T-2)  The Contracting Officer is  responsible  for  ensuring  contract  closeout  is  accomplished  within  the  electronic  purchasing systems.  (T-2)    NAFIs  will  notify  the  AFNAFPO  of  any  contractor  associated  with  the  CSBP whose goods or services do not conform to contract terms and conditions. (T-2) 12.2.  Inspection, Acceptance, and Receiving Reports.  The receiving activity is the authorized representative of the Contracting Officer for the purpose of conducting oversight and acceptance of  supplies  and  services  when  the  contract  provides  for  acceptance  and/or  inspection  at  final destination.  The receiving activity will accomplish acceptance of goods and services in the NAF electronic purchasing systems within the first business day after delivery. (T-2)  When delivery did  not  occur,  the  Contracting  Officer  will  perform  follow  up  within  a  reasonable  time (maximum 7 days) after the original delivery date to determine the cause of delay and establish an  acceptable  delivery  date  and  contractor  consideration,  as  applicable.  (T-2)    For  overseas activities,  follow-up  requests  should  be  made  within  30  days  after  the  delivery  date  to  the stateside  port.    The  delivery  date  identified  on  the  order/contract  for  shipments  overseas  is  the required  delivery  date  to  the  port  and  not  the  final  destination.    If  defective  or  nonconforming supplies  are  not  rejected  within  the  time  allowed  by  the  contract,  or  in  the  absence  of  such provision, within a reasonable length of time, the NAFI is considered to have accepted them.  If a contractor fails to make delivery after follow-up action, cancellation of the order/contract may be executed if it is in the best interest of the NAFI. 12.2.1.  The following actions should be taken whenever a shipment is received: 12.2.1.1.  The receiving official should be present when goods are received. 12.2.1.2.  The Receiving Official must examine all boxes, cartons, packages, containers, etc., for damage before  opening.  (T-2)   Outside  damage may  consist  of  cave-ins,  holes, water marks, etc. 12.2.1.3.  Inspection  of  actual  goods  should  consist  of  at  least  matching  stock  numbers, quantity,  kind,  color,  etc.,  with  the  contract  and  any  modifications  thereto.    See Attachment 3 to file claims for the loss of or damage to in-transit NAF property. 12.2.2.  The receiving official shall ensure receiving reports include acceptance by signature and  date  either  electronically  or  manually.  (T-2)    Sales  slips,  delivery  tickets,  Material Inspection and Receiving Report, electronic formats established for receiving, or other forms used commercially or internally are acceptable to verify receipt and acceptance of goods or services.  Partial shipments should be processed in a timely manner to ensure payment to the contractor.  The receiving official shall ensure payments are made for partial deliveries when authorized by the terms of the award. (T-2) 40 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 12.2.3.  Proof-of-Shipment  Procedure  (Overseas  only).    Under  the  proof-of-shipment procedure,  acceptance  occurs  when  the  shipment  is  received  by  the  common  carrier  or  the government  representative  at  the  Consolidation  Containerization  Point  (CCP)  or  Port  of Embarkation  (POE).    Inspection  of  goods  is  waived  until  receipt  at  final  destination.  Payment is made upon receipt of a proper invoice and proof of shipment. 12.3.  Termination  of  Orders  or  Contracts.  Only  Contracting  Officers  are  authorized  to terminate  orders  or  contracts.    The  Contracting  Officer  will  obtain  legal  coordination/review when  any  termination  action  is  contemplated.  (T-2)    There  are  two  types  of  terminations:  Termination for Convenience (T for C) and Termination for Default (T for D). 12.3.1.  Termination  for  Convenience  occurs  when  the  Contracting  Officer  determines  that such  termination  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  NAFI.    A  termination  for  convenience  may involve costs.  Any termination costs exceeding the Contracting Officer’s warrant authority should  be  forwarded  to  the  SCO  or  AFNAFPO  for  termination  action.    The  parties  may mutually agree to a no cost termination or cancellation. 12.3.2.  Termination for Default is warranted when the contractor fails to deliver supplies or perform  services  within  the  time  specified  in  the  contract,  when  the  contractor  fails  to perform any other provision of the contract, or when the contractor fails to make progress so as  to  endanger  performance  of  the  contract.    A  termination  for  default  requires  sufficient documentation to validate the termination.  Before proceeding with a termination for default, the contractor should be issued a cure notice or  show cause notice as appropriate.    If, after compliance  with  the  procedures  in  paragraphs  12.3.2.1  or  12.2.3.2,  the  Contracting  Officer determines  that  a  termination  for  default  is  proper,  the  Contracting  Officer  must  refer  the proposed  final  decision  to  the  cognizant  legal  office  for  legal  advice  and  coordination  with AFLOA/JAQ.  Notice of termination must include the contract number and date; the acts or omissions  constituting  the  default;  a  statement  that  the  contractor’s  right  to  proceed  further under the contract (or a specified portion of the contract) is terminated; that the supplies or services  terminated  may  be  purchased  against  the  contractor’s  account,  and  that  the contractor is held liable for any excess costs; that the NAFI reserves all rights and remedies provided  by  law  or  under  the  contract,  in  addition  to  charging  excess  costs;  and  that  the contractor  has  the  right  to  appeal  the  termination  to  AFNAFPO.  (T-1).    The  NAFI  shall provide a copy of the notice of termination (electronically or in writing) to AFNAFPO. (T-2)  A copy of any notice of termination for default with estimated re-procurement costs greater than $500,000 shall be provided to SAF/AQCA. 12.3.2.1.  Cure  notice.    If  a  contractor  fails  to  perform  other  provisions  of  the  contract (such  as  not  furnishing  a  required  performance  bond,  required  certifications,  etc.)  or  so fails to make progress as to endanger performance of the contract, the Contracting Officer shall give the contractor written notice specifying the failure and provide a period of 10 days (or longer period as necessary) in which to cure the failure. (T-2)  The Contracting Officer  shall  issue  cure  notices  by  certified  mail,  return  receipt  requested.  (T-2)    Upon expiration of the 10 days (or longer period), the Contracting Officer may issue a notice of termination for default unless it is determined that the failure to perform has been cured. 12.3.2.2.  Show cause notice.  If the contractor has failed to make delivery of the supplies or  to  perform  the  services  within  the  specified  time,  a  notice  of  failure  or  notice  of  the possibility of termination for default is not required to be sent to the contractor before the AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 41 actual notice of termination.  However, the contractor may be issued a show cause notice.  This show cause notice should be sent immediately upon expiration of the delivery period and should state that failure of the contractor to present an explanation may be  taken as an admission that no valid explanation exists.  The Contracting Officer shall issue show cause notices by certified mail, return receipt requested. (T-2) 12.4.  Changes  to  Award  Documents.  Only  Contracting  Officers  are  authorized  to  issue modifications to award documents.  However, NAF activity personnel who have been delegated the  authority  by  the  Contracting  Officer  to  place  calls  can  make  changes  to  calls  against BPAs/BDOs provided the change is within the scope of the BPA/BDO.  NAF Activity Personnel must ensure NAFs are available or obtained when additional funding is needed. (T-2) 12.4.1.  Use the NAF electronic purchasing system to issue modifications or amendments to purchasing  documents.    If  the  electronic  system  is  not  available,  then  utilize  the, Amendment  of  Solicitation/Modification  of  Contract,  available  on  the  AFNAFPO website.    Only  the  contracting  office  that  issued  the  order/contract  will  make  all modifications/amendments  unless  the  written  authority  is  delegated  to  another  contracting office. (T-2) 12.4.1.1.  Contracting  Officers  will  number  modifications/amendments  sequentially.  (T-2)    Contracting  Officers  will  ensure  modification/amendment  numbering  is  compatible with  the  NAF  electronic  purchasing  system.  (T-2)    Any  downward  adjustments  do  not require a modification unless the Contracting Officer deems it is in the best interest of the NAFI. 12.4.1.2.  Unilateral/bilateral  modifications  are  determined  based  on  the  nature  of  the change  to  the  order/contract.    Unilateral  modifications  require  only  the  Contracting Officer’s  signature  whereas  bilateral  modifications  require  the  signature  of  the Contracting  Officer  and  the  contractor’s  authorized  representative.    Administrative changes  usually  can  be  accomplished  with  a  unilateral  modification  whereas  significant changes  such  as  change  in  quantity,  dollar  adjustments,  or  changes  in  the  delivery schedule  require  a  bilateral  modification.    Bilateral  modifications  are  prepared  and forwarded to the contractor for signature prior to signing by the Contracting Officer. 12.4.2.  In the event a NAF contractor makes an allegation of frustration of purpose or breach of contract, that information should be immediately communicated to the chain of command and the servicing legal office with a notification to AFLOA/JAQ. 12.5.  Protests.  Protests involving NAF contracts (except when issued by an APF buying office) are  not  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  U.S.  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  or courts.  AFNAFPO makes determinations on protests for contracts executed centrally.  The NAF Contracting  Officer  will  resolve  all  protests  of  base  level  contracts.  (T-2)    All  protests  will  be reviewed by the servicing legal office prior to a final decision being issued. (T-2) 12.5.1.  Protests should be concise and logically presented to facilitate review by the agency.  Failure to substantially comply with any of the requirements in the subparagraphs below may be grounds for dismissal of the protest. 12.5.1.1.  Protests include the following information: 12.5.1.1.1.  Name, address, and fax and telephone numbers of the protester; 42 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 12.5.1.1.2.  Solicitation or contract number; 12.5.1.1.3.  Detailed  statement  of  the  legal  and  factual  grounds  for  the  protest,  to include a description of resulting prejudice to the protester; 12.5.1.1.4.  Copies of relevant documents; 12.5.1.1.5.  Request for a ruling by the agency; and, 12.5.1.1.6.  Statement as to the form of relief requested. 12.5.1.1.7.  All information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purpose of filing a protest. 12.5.1.1.8.  All information establishing the timeliness of the protest. 12.5.1.2.  All  protests  filed  are  addressed  to  the  Contracting  Officer  or  other  official designated to receive protests. 12.5.2.  Protests  prior  to  award.    Protests  based  upon  alleged  improprieties  in  a  solicitation which are apparent prior to the time set for receipt of initial proposals  are filed prior to the time set for receipt of initial proposals.  All other protests are filed not later than 10 calendar days after the basis of protest is known or should have been known. 12.5.2.1.  When a protest  is  received prior to  the  award of a contract,  the  award  will be delayed  until  the  protest  (including  appeals)  is  resolved,  unless  one  of  the  following applies (such determination will be made at one level above the Contracting Officer): 12.5.2.1.1.  The supplies or services to be contracted for are urgently required. 12.5.2.1.2.  Delivery  or  performance  will  be  unduly  delayed  by  failure  to  make  a prompt award. 12.5.2.1.3.  Expiration  of  current  contract  is  imminent  and  continued  service  is required. 12.5.2.1.4.  A timely award will otherwise be advantageous to the NAFI. 12.5.2.2.  Before awarding a contract under the above-cited circumstances, written advice of legal counsel shall be obtained and placed in the contract file. 12.5.2.3.  The  Contracting  Officer  will  determine  the  merits  of  the  protest  as expeditiously  as  possible.    If  the  Contracting  Officer  finds  that  a  protest  has  merit  (for example, ambiguous specifications, flawed  evaluation process), he or she will promptly take  appropriate  corrective  action.    Such  possible  actions  include,  among  others,  the rejection of all proposals and issuance of a new or amended solicitation or using revised specifications or evaluation criteria.  In the event of amended solicitations, the scheduled date for receipt of proposals will be extended accordingly.  If the resolution of the protest makes  previously  ineligible  offers  eligible  for  award,  appropriate  notification  will  be given to the offerors concerned. 12.5.3.  Protests after award.  To be considered, a protest shall be lodged within 10 calendar days of notification of contract award.  When a protest is received by the Contracting Officer after  the  contract  has  been  awarded,  the  contract  normally  will  not  be  terminated.    If  the AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 43 Contracting Officer finds merit in the protest, he or she shall seek legal advice to determine the most appropriate course of action. 12.5.4.  The protestor may appeal  a protest  decision  within 10 calendar days of its issuance by AFNAFPO or the base NAF Contracting Officer.  Comptroller General decisions and this manual are primary sources of authority for deciding protests. 12.5.5.  Decisions  issued  by  NAF  Contracting  Officers  may  be  appealed  to  AFNAFPO.  AFNAFPO is the final protest appeal authority for protests to the NAF Contracting Officer.  Decisions  made  by  AFNAFPO  may  be  appealed  to  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  (DAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC.  SAF/AQC is the protest appeal authority for AFNAFPO awarded acquisitions.  SAF/AQC’s address: 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1060. 12.5.6.  Appeals  of  decisions  issued  by  a  base  NAF  Contracting  Officer  are  filed  with  the executing base’s NAF contracting office.  The base NAF contracting office will forward the appeal to AFNAFPO, accompanied by a background paper outlining the facts, a copy of the contract  and  all  related  documents,  and  a  proposed  reply.  (T-1)    The  Director  of  AF  NAF Purchasing  is  the  decision  authority  on  appeals  of  decisions  issued  by  the  base  NAF Contracting Officer. 12.6.  Claims.  The  Contracting  Officer  is  responsible  for  processing  contract  claims  filed against the NAFI.  A claim by the contractor must be in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer  for  a  written  decision.   Where  the  claim  exceeds  $100,000,  the  claim  shall  be  certified and  signed  by  a  person  authorized  to  bind  the  contractor.    The  content  of  the  certification  is prescribed  by  the  Disputes  Clause  in  the  contract.    The  Contracting  Officer  must  immediately notify  the  funds  custodian  and  the  Staff  Judge  Advocate  in  writing  when  a  claim  is  filed  by  a contractor.  (T-2)    Include  in  the  notification  the  amount  claimed  by  the  contractor.    The Contracting Officer must obtain additional funds from the funds custodian before commitment of funds  to  settle  a  claim  when  the  amount  of  available  funds  on  the  purchase  request  would  be exceeded. (T-1) 12.6.1.  A  claim  by  the  Contractor  shall  be  made  in  writing  and  submitted  to  the  NAF Contracting Officer for a written decision.  A claim by the NAFI against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the NAF Contracting Officer. 12.6.2.  For  contract  claims  less  than  $100,000,  the  NAF  Contracting  Officer  must,  if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. 12.6.3.  For  Contractor-certified  claims  over  $100,000,  the  NAF  Contracting  Officer  must, within 60 days, decide the claim  or notify the Contractor of the date by  which the decision will be made.  Prior to making a final decision on a claim, the Contracting Officer must refer the  matter  to  the  servicing  legal  office  for  advice,  ADR  suitability,  and  appropriate  dispute resolution  strategies.    Contracting  Officers  must  use  ADR  to  the  maximum  extent practicable.  (See AFPD 51-12, Alternative Dispute Resolution).  All proposed final decisions must be reviewed by AFLOA/JAQ. 12.6.4.  The  NAF  Contracting  Officer’s  final  decision  on  claims  may  be  appealed  by submitting a written appeal to Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) with a copy to the Contracting Officer, within 90 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer’s final decision.  ASBCA decisions are final and are not subject to further appeal. 44 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 12.6.4.1.  AFLOA/JAQ represents the Air Force in appeals to the ASBCA. 12.6.4.2.  If the contractor files an appeal with the ASBCA, the Contracting Officer must notify AFNAFPO and forward to  AFLOA/JAQ and the servicing legal  office a  copy of any  notice  of  appeal  to  the  ASBCA,  along  with  the  envelope  in  which  the  notice  was received.    If  the  contractor  files  an  appeal  with  the  Contracting  Officer  instead  of  the ASBCA,  the  Contracting  Officer  must  immediately  notify  AFLOA/JAQ  of  the  date  the appeal was received and forward to AFLOA/JAQ and the servicing legal office a copy of the appeal and a copy of the envelope in which the appeal was received.  The Contracting Officer must forward the original appeal and envelope to AFLOA/JAQ, which will then forward the appeal and envelope to the ASBCA, as necessary. 12.6.4.3.  The  Contracting  Officer  must  prepare  a  “Rule  4  file”  for  any  appeal  to  the ASBCA in accordance with Rule 4 of the ASBCA rules (see  DFARS Appendix A, Part 2).  The Contracting Officer must consult with AFLOA/JAQ before including in the Rule 4  file  any  legal  opinions  or  intra-governmental  or  inter-governmental  documents  as described  in  DoD  Regulation  5400.7,  DoD  Freedom  of  Information  Act  Program,  and FAR 24.2. 12.6.4.4.  While  an  appeal  is  pending,  the  Contracting  Officer  along  with  the  customer and  servicing  legal  office  will  support  the  assigned  trial  attorney  as  required  including; identifying  and  locating  government  witnesses,  gathering  contractual  documents  and other  physical  evidence  for  conferences  and  hearings  necessary  to  defend  or  otherwise dispose of an appeal. 12.6.4.5.  Once the Rule 4 file is complete, AFLOA/JAQ will file it with the ASBCA on behalf of the Contracting Officer. 12.6.5.  All claims will be reported to the Director of NAF Purchasing within 5 business days and AFNAFPO will maintain a record of each claim  submitted.  NAF Contracting Officers will provide periodic updates to the Director of NAF Purchasing  until the claim is settled or appeals have expired. 12.6.6.  AFNAFPO must  promptly notify SAF/AQC with  all known information  relating  to any  proposed  final  decision  on  a  claim  over  $500,000,  and  provide  periodic  updates  to SAF/AQCA until the claim is settled or appeals have expired. 12.7.  NAF  Ratification  Procedures.  At  base  level,  the  FSS  Commander  (or  equivalent)  may approve  ratifications  up  to  and  including  $50,000.    Ratifications  that  exceed  that  amount  are forwarded to AFNAFPO for approval.  At a minimum, the ratification package will contain the following: 12.7.1.  The  individual  who  committed  the  unauthorized  purchase  will  prepare  a  detailed statement of facts and a purchase request, then forward to his/her supervisor for review and action. (T-2) 12.7.2.  The  supervisor  will  review  the  statement  of  facts  for  adequacy  and  certify  that  the item(s)/services were received and used for an authorized purpose; that funds were available at  the  time  the  commitment  was  made;  and  indicate  what  actions  were  taken  to  prevent recurrence. (T-2)  The supervisor will forward all documentation (Employee’s Statement of Facts,  Supervisor’s  Certification,  Invoice,  and  funded  Purchase  Request)  to  the  NAF AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 45 Contracting Officer. (T-2)  In the event a signed statement from the individual who made the unauthorized commitment cannot be obtained, the supervisor of the individual will explain in writing why the statement is unavailable. (T-2) 12.7.3.  The  NAF  Contracting  Officer  will  review  the  ratification  package  for  adequacy, prepare  the  necessary  contractual  documents,  and  forward  to  the  servicing  legal  office  for review.  (T-2)    After  legal  review,  the  package  is  forwarded  to  the  ratifying  authority  for consideration.    If  approved  by  the  ratifying  authority,  the  Contracting  Officer  will  sign  the contract and make appropriate distribution. (T-2)  If the action is not ratified the file includes the method used to resolve the matter. 46 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 Chapter 13 ELECTRONIC COMMERCE (EC) IN NAF CONTRACTING 13.1.  Electronic Commerce  (EC).  EC as it applies to NAF contracting means the exchange of contracting information electronically between the NAFI and the private sector.  NAF Activities will  use  the  NAF  electronic  purchasing  systems  approved  by  AFNAFPO  for  purchases.  (T-2)  All  users  requiring  access  to  the  electronic  purchasing  systems  must  be  submitted  through  the NAF  base  system  administrator  to  verify  that  the  access  and  authority  levels  requested  in  the system correspond to their job duties.  Personnel without a specific need to access the electronic purchasing systems will not be granted access. 13.2.  Contracting  Officer’s  Signature.  Contracting  documents  generated  by  automated procurement  systems  may  use  an  electronic  signature  to  represent  the  Contracting  Officer’s authorization  of  the  contract  action.    This  authorization  applies  to  all  electronically  generated contracting  documents,  even  when  EC  cannot  be  completely  executed  (e.g.,  some  contractors may  not  be  capable  of  accepting  EC).    In  this  situation,  the  contracting  office  mails  the electronically generated contracting document with the option to sign the hard copy.  Contractors may use an electronic signature on contracting documents where applicable.  NAF Activities will use EC only if the following conditions are met: (T-2) 13.2.1.  Use  of  personal  identification  codes  to  control  access  to  electronic  generation software and to permit only the signer use of the digital signature. 13.2.2.  Transmission and storage of a discrete electronic symbol to represent the Contracting Officer’s signature. 13.2.3.  Use of a discrete authentication intended to bind, as a means of verifying the identity of the individual originating the contracting action and to validate transaction content. 13.2.4.  The electronic signature is linked to the data in the signed document in such a way that modification of the data would invalidate the signature. 13.2.5.  Entering  documents  by  proxy.    The  NAF  electronic  purchasing  system  allows documents  such  as  PRs,  orders,  and  contracts  to  be  created  and  entered  by  proxy.    Before using this function, Contracting Officers must ensure that documents with original signatures are electronically scanned and attached in the NAF electronic purchasing system. (T-2) 13.3.  Electronic  Commerce  Distribution.  EC  contracting  systems  may  be  used  to  distribute contractual documents if they transmit all the information contained in the input to the reviewing system and provide an electronic signature in accordance with paragraph 13.2. 13.4.  Electronic  Creation  and  Storage  of  Contract  Files.  Contracting  activities  shall  create and store contractual documents and files electronically and ensure: (T-2) 13.4.1.  Access to document creation software and applications are controlled. 13.4.2.  Audit trails of transactions and significant events are maintained. 13.4.3.  Electronic  documents  and  files  are  executed  by  individuals  acting  within  their authority. 13.4.4.  Dates and times of all records and modifications are defined and recorded. AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 47  DARLENE J.

It does not include the installation of carpet, wall covering, or draperies. Also, it does not include the  manufacture,  production,  furnishing,  construction,  alteration,  repair,  processing  or assembling of products or other kinds of personal property. Continental United States (CONUS)—The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia, further defined as the United States territory, including adjacent territorial waters, located within the North American Continent between Canada and Mexico. Contract—An  agreement  that  creates  a  legal  obligation.  The  elements  of  a  contract  are:  (1)  a mutual  agreement;  (2)  between  competent  parties;  (3)  for  a  legal  purpose;  (4)  involving  the exchange of legal consideration; (5) which creates a mutuality of obligation to perform between the parties. The term contract as used in this manual includes, without limitation, formal bilateral contracts,  purchase  orders,  agreements,  and  modifications  as  well  as  other  agreements  entered into by an authorized Contracting Officer acting within his/her authority. AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 51 Contracting  Officer—A person authorized in writing, either by appointment or by position, to execute and administer contracts on behalf of a NAFI.

Petty Cash—A cash fund of a fixed amount set through an advance of funds, for immediate cash payment of relatively small amounts for authorized buys of goods and services. Purchase  Order—A  simplified  method  to  buy  goods  or  services.  All  necessary  terms  and conditions  are  included  in  the  order  form,  and  the  price  is  obtained  based  on  oral  or  written solicitations. A unilateral purchase order is where the NAFI issues an order for goods or services without express  written acceptance of the terms  by the vendor. Acceptance occurs when and if the  vendor  performs  according  to  the  order,  at  which  time  a  binding  contract  is  formed.  A bilateral purchase order is where both parties expressly agree to enter into mutual obligations (for NAF  contracting,  this  involves  obtaining  a  vendor’s  signature  on  a  contract  document  before performance).

Instructions.  A worker who is required to comply with other persons’ instructions about when,  where,  and  how  he  or  she  is  to  work  is  ordinarily  an  employee.    This  control  factor  is present  if  the  person  or  persons  for  whom  the  services  are  performed  have  the  right  to  require compliance with instructions. A2.2.  Training.  Training  the  worker  by  requiring  an  experienced  employee  to  work  with  the worker,  by  corresponding  with  the  worker,  by  requiring  the  worker  to  attend  meetings,  or  by using other methods, indicates that  the person or  persons for whom the services  are performed want the services performed in a particular method or manner. A2.3.  Integration.  Integration  of  the  worker’s  services  into  the  overall  business  operations generally  shows  that  the  worker  is  subject  to  direction  and  control.  When  the  success  or continuation  of  a  business  depends  to  an  appreciable  degree  upon  the  performance  of  certain services, the workers who perform those services must necessarily be subject to a certain amount of control by the owner of the business. A2.4.  Services Rendered Personally.  If the services must be rendered personally, presumably the person or persons for whom the services are performed are interested in the methods used to accomplish the work as well as in the results, and the control factor is satisfied. A2.5.  Continuing Relationship.  A continuing and regular relationship between the worker and the person or persons for whom the services are performed indicates that an employer/employee relationship  exists.    A  continuing  and  regular  basis  may  exist  where  work  is  performed  at frequently recurring, although irregular intervals. A2.6.  Set Hours Of Work.  The establishment of set hours of work by the person or persons for whom the services are performed is a factor indicating and showing necessary control. A2.7.  Doing Work On Employer’s Premises.  If the work is performed on the premises of the person or persons for whom the services are being performed, that factor suggests control over the  worker,  especially  if  the  work  could  be  done  elsewhere.  Work  done  off  the  premise  of  the person  or  persons  receiving  the  services,  such  as  at  the  office  of  the  worker,  indicates  some freedom  from  control.    However,  this  fact  by  itself  does  not  mean  that  the  worker  is  not  an employee.  The importance of this factor depends on the nature of the service involved and the extent  to  which  an  employer  generally  would  require  that  employees  perform  such  services  on the employer’s premises.  Control over the place of work is indicated when the person or persons for whom the services are performed have the right to compel the worker to travel a designated route, to canvas a territory within a certain time, or to work at specific places as required. A2.8.  Order Or Sequence Set.  If a worker must perform services in the order or sequence set by the person or persons for whom the services are performed, that factor shows that the worker is not free to follow the worker’s own pattern of work but must follow the established routines and schedules of the person or persons for whom the services are performed.  Often, because of the nature of an occupation, the person or persons for whom the services are performed do not set  the  order  of  the  services  or  set  the  order  infrequently.    It  is  sufficient  to  show  control, however, if such person or persons retain the right to do so. 54 AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 A2.9.  Oral  Or  Written  Reports.  A  requirement  that  the  worker  submit  regular  or  written reports  to  the  person  or  persons  for  whom  the  services  are  performed  indicates  a  degree  of control appropriate for an employee. A2.10.  Payment Of Business And/Or Traveling Expenses.  If the person or persons for whom the  services  are  performed  ordinarily  pay  the  worker’s  business  and/or  traveling  expenses,  the worker is ordinarily an employee.  An employer, to be able to control expenses, generally retains the right to regulate and direct the worker’s business activities. A2.11.  Furnishing Of Tools And Materials.  The fact that the person or persons for whom the services are performed furnish significant tools, materials, and other equipment tends to show the existence of an employer/employee relationship. A2.12.  Right  To  Discharge.  The  right  to  discharge  a  worker  is  a  factor  indicating  that  the worker  is  an  employee  and  the  person  possessing  the  right  is  an  employer.  An  employer exercises control through the threat of dismissal, which causes the worker to obey the employer’s instructions.    An  independent  contractor,  on  the  other  hand,  cannot  be  fired  so  long  as  the independent contractor produces a result that meets the contract specifications. A2.13.  Right To Terminate.  If the worker has the right to end his or her relationship with the person  for  whom  the  services  are  performed  at  any  time  he  or  she  wishes  without  incurring liability, that factor indicates an employer/employee relationship. A2.14.  Significant Investment.  If the worker invests in facilities that are used by the worker in performing services and are not typically maintained by employees (such as the maintenance of an office rented at fair value from a related party), that factor tends to indicate that the worker is an  independent  contractor.    On  the  other  hand,  lack  of  investment  in  facilities  indicates dependence on the person or persons for which the services are performed for such facilities and accordingly,  the  existence  of  an  employer/employee  relationship.    Special  scrutiny  is  required with respect to certain types of facilities such as home offices. A2.15.  Realization Of Profit Or Loss.  A worker who can realize a profit or suffer a loss as a result of the worker’s services (in addition to the profit or loss ordinarily realized by employees) is generally an independent contractor, but the worker who cannot is an employee.  For example, if the worker is subject to a real risk of economic loss due to significant investments or a bona fide liability for expenses, such as salary payments to unrelated employees, that factor indicates that the worker is an independent contractor.  The risk that the worker will not receive payment for his or her services, however, is common to both independent contractors and employees and thus  does  not  constitute  a  sufficient  economic  risk  to  support  treatment  as  an  independent contractor. A2.16.  Working  For  More  Than  One  Firm  At  A  Time.  If  a  worker  performs  more  than minimal  services  for  a  multiple  of  unrelated  persons  or  firms  at  the  same  time,  that  factor generally  indicates  that  the  worker  is  an  independent  contractor.    However,  a  worker  who performs  services  for  more  than  one  person  may  be  an  employee  of  each  of  the  persons, especially where such persons are part of the same service arrangement. A2.17.  Making  Services  Available  To  General  Public.  The  fact  that  a  worker  makes  his  or her  services  available  to  the  general  public  on  a  regular  and  consistent  basis  indicates  an independent contractor relationship. AFMAN64-302  8 NOVEMBER 2016 55 A2.18.  Hiring  Supervising,  And  Paying  Assistants.  If  the  person  or  persons  for  whom  the services  are  performed  hire,  supervise,  and  pay  assistants,  that  factor  generally  shows  control over  the  workers  on  the  job.    However,  if  one  worker  hires,  supervises,  and  pays  the  other assistants pursuant to a contract under which the worker is responsible only for the attainment of a result, this factor indicates an independent contractor status. A2.19.  Full Time Required.  If the worker must devote substantially full time to the business of the person or persons for whom the services are performed, such person or persons have control over the amount of time the worker spends working and thereby restricts the worker from doing other gainful work.
