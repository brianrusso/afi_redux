DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE Headquarters, United States Air Force Washington, DC 20330-1030 CFETP 21MX Parts I and II     31 May 2017 AFSC 21MX MUNITIONS AND MISSILE MAINTENANCE OFFICER                CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN ACCESSIBILITY: Publications and forms are available on the e-publishing website  at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/ for downloading or ordering. RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.         Munitions Maintenance The  Munitions  and  Missile  Maintenance  Officer  combines  a  unique  Air  Force  expertise  in nuclear  surety and weapons safety founded on maintenance discipline essential to enabling the Air  Force’s  ability  to  fly,  fight,  and  win.  As  logisticians,  munitions  and  missile  maintenance officers  develop  joint  capabilities  while  mastering  specialized  munitions  maintenance  skills. They  hold the  critical  responsibility  to  formulate  and  implement  maintenance  procedures that  ensure  Air  Force  arsenals  are  always  fully  stocked,  highly  functional  and  ready  to  be deployed and continue  a diverse missile and maintenance heraldry. Air Force Maintenance Badge Heraldry The  design  of  the  falcon  is  a  replica  of  the  maintenance  falcon  located  in  the  National Cathedral  at  Washington  DC.  The  falcon  symbolizes  the  airborne  strength  by  the  Air  Force and  made  possible  by  the  maintenance  of  aircraft,  munitions,  and  communications-electronics equipment.  In  its  talons,  the  falcon  is  holding  a  bomb  and  a  generic  21st  century  aircraft. They  are  crossed  to  show  the  interrelationship  of  the  career  fields.  The  three  levels  of  the award  are  signified  by  the  addition  of  a  star  centered  above  the  falcon  for  the  senior  level and the star  surrounded by  an olive wreath for the master level. The  aircraft,  streamlined  to  depict  a  21st  century  aircraft,  is  symbolic  of  all  aircraft maintained  by  the  personnel  who  will  wear  the  badge  into  the  21st  century. The  aircraft  has three  leadingedges,  which  represent  the  three  enlisted  maintenance  specialties:  aircraft, munitions,  and  communications-electronics.  The  personnel,  like  the  leading  edges  of  the aircraft,  work  together to  support  the  flying  mission.  The  bomb,  streamlined  to  depict  a modern  munition,  symbolizes  the  primary  mission  of  the  Air  Force  maintainer  to  make  sure they put the bombs on target.  The  field  is  without  obstruction  and  depicts  a  free  sky  and  the olive  wreath  surrounding  the  badge  symbolizes  the  peace,  which  we  defend  through professional maintenance.  The Missile Badge Heraldry The  first  distinctive  missile  badge  was  established  May  23,  1958,  to  recognize  those  within the  Air  Force  who  had  a  direct  role  in  the  development,  maintenance  or  operation  of guided  missiles.  The  badge  was  first  called  the  Guided  Missile  Insignia  and  was  authorized for  those  who  performed  duty  in  or  were  associated  with  the  Snark,  Atlas,  Goose,  Thor, Jupiter,  Matador,  Mace,  Bomarc,  Titan  and  Minuteman  missile  systems. In  1963,  the  name was  changed  to  the  Missileman  Badge  and  three  levels  of  expertise  were  established: Basic,  Senior,  and  Master  Missileman.  The  honor  of  wearing  the  badge  went  to  those  who completed  specialized  missile  training.  In April  1979, the name of  the Missileman  Badge was once again changed, this time to  the Missile Badge, deleting any reference to gender.  In  1988, with  the  approval  of  the  “Missile  Operations  Designator,”  a  wreath  encircling  the  Missile Badge, the  original  Missile  Badge  became  a  badge  awarded  exclusively  to  missile maintainers.  The  Missile  Badge  is  now  awarded  to  maintenance  personnel  working  in  the ICBM, cruise missile, and air-to-air missile systems. The  original  design  of  the  Missile  Badge  was  prepared  by  the  United  States  Army Heraldic  Division at Arlington, Virginia. There are four significant elements of the badge.  The use of the  generic missile is intentional so as to resemble no particular missile in the inventory. ii  The  badge  was  given  an  hourglass  shape  to  signify  the  timeliness  of  the  weapon  systems’ response  capabilities.  The  four  stars,  two  on  either  side  of  the  missile,  represent  the operational  domain  of  the  missile  systems,  the  total  aerospace  environment.  Finally,  two vertical bands beneath the  missile represent a residual vapor trail left by a missile in flight.    iii     DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE Headquarters, United States Air Force Washington, DC 20330-1030 CFETP 21MX Parts I and II     31 May 2017 TABLE OF CONTENTS Preface Definitions/Acronyms/Abbreviations PART I Section A, General Information Purpose of the CFETP CFETP Uses Coordination and Approval    Section B, Career Field Progression and Information Purpose Specialty Description Duties and Responsibilities Specialty Qualifications Skill and Career Progression Entry Level Basic Certification Intermediate Level Senior Certification Staff and Senior Level Master Certification Grandfather Plan          U&TW Training Decisions          21M Career Progression  Section C, Proficiency Training Requirements Purpose 21M1 and 21M3 Specialty Qualification Requirements 21M4 Specialty Qualification Requirements  Section D, Resource Constraints Resource Constraints  OPR: 363 TRS/TRR (Mr. Henrick Petrosian), DSN 736-3279 Certified by: AF/A4LW, Col Kim Brooks Supersedes: CFETP 21MX, dated 12 Nov 2014 Pages: 56 iv 1 2 7 7 7 7 8 9 9 9 9 10 12 12 13 13 13 13 14 14 15 15 18 18 18 18 19 19                PART II Purpose Section A, Course Training Standards Task, Knowledge, and Proficiency Level requirements Customer Feedback Records Documentation Section B, Training Course Index Purpose Munitions and Missile Maintenance Officer AFSC Awarding Courses Non-AFSC Awarding Courses Air Force In-Residence Courses Air Force Enlisted Career Development Courses (CDC) Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) Field Training Detachment Courses (FTD) Extension Course Institute (ECI) Courses Exportable Courses Follow-on MAJCOM/Unit Courses Department of Defense Courses Section C, Support Material Reference List Follow-on Unit Training Maintenance Officer Training Task List 21M3X Core Requirements 21M3A Requirements 21M3N Requirements 21M3I Requirements Senior Certification Requirements Master Certification Requirements Section D, MAJCOM Unique Requirements Tables       Table 1.

In turn, this will require new knowledge, skills, and abilities in our officer, enlisted, and civilian workforce that align to the way we must operate in the future.  These changes must be identified and implemented across the near, mid, and long-term planning time frames. Vision:  We must be able to deliberately, repeatedly, and affordably deliver high quality, integrated, agile Total Force logisticians, across all planning time horizons, with the right competencies, at the right place, at the right time to provide agile logistics support of Global Vigilance – Global Reach – Global Power.”              Air Force Logistics Human Capital Strategy, 2016 1.  The  Aug 2016  21X  Utilization  and  Training  Workshop  drove  significant  and  necessary  changes  to the  21M  career  field.    The  most  significant  change  is  the  requirement  to  functionally-pair,  or  gain  a second  21M  shred,  prior  to  senior  certification.    This  change  was  made  in  order  to  grow  breadth  of experience in various weapon systems within the 21M community.  Growing this breadth of experience is a deliberate and essential developmental strategy to ensure the Air Force has a robust, versatile inventory of 21M officers to serve in a variety of leadership positions across an officer’s career.     2.  Force  Development  is  designed  to  link  training  and  education  to  assignment  experiences,  connect individual  goals  to  Air  Force  requirements,  invest  the  right  education  and  training  experience  at  the right  time  for  the  officer,  and  to  enhance  leadership  and  functional  competencies  to  best  utilize individual  officers  throughout  the  development  and  assignment  processes.  Successful  careers  have  a common  thread;  a  good  combination  of  depth  (significant  expertise  in  a  core  area)  and  breadth (experience across multiple missions that complement core knowledge and/or officer growth). 3.  The  Munitions  and  Missile  Maintenance  Officer  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP) is  the  vehicle  used to  communicate  force  development  guidance.  This  guidance  facilitates  the  growth  of future  munitions  leaders  and  provides  a  “training  roadmap”  that  identifies  mandatory  and  optional  skill- level training. 4.  The  CFETP  provides  force  development  guidance  that  the  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC) assignment  team  (AT)  uses  to  make  informed  decisions  in  support  of  an  officer’s  career  progression. Upon  selection  to  major,  the  developmental  team  (DT)  adds  rigor  to  the  process  and  provides  career vectors,  which  AFPC  uses  to  match  officers  to  future  assignments.  The  primary  objective  is  to  ensure officers  remain  proficient  in  munitions  and  missile  maintenance  fundamentals  and  disciplines  while improving  personal  skill  sets  and  expertise  needed  to  successfully  operate  and  lead  across  an  evolving maintenance  spectrum. 1             DEFINITIONS/ACCRONYMS/ABBREVIATIONS Advanced  Training.

Purpose. This  CFETP  contains  information  for  career  field  functional  managers,  training  managers, commanders, supervisors, trainers,  and  technical  training  centers  to  plan,  develop,  manage  and  conduct  a robust 21M training and force development program. The CFETP: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to ensure officers receive training at appropriate points in their career. 1.2.  Identifies requirements for each certification level and recommends training for each career phase. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty. 1.4. Identifies training sources and the training medium. 1.5.  Establishes force development guidance that the AFPC assignment team uses to allocate assignments. 2. CFETP Uses. MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM) and supervisors at all levels will use this plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training program is instituted for each officer. 2.1.  Air  Education  and  Training  Command  (AETC)  develops/revises  formal  resident,  and  exportable training  based  on  user  requirements  documented  in  this  CFETP.  AETC  is  responsible  for  developing procurement and acquisition strategies to obtain the resources required to provide training identified in the CFETP.  The  AETC  Course  Training  Manager  (AETC  CTM)  and  the  AFCFM  are  the  custodians  of  this CFETP  and  ensures  HQ  AFPC/DPPAT  receives  approved  revisions  for  publication.  The  AETC  CTM  is responsible for notifying HQ AETC to index the CFETP in http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. 2.2.  The  AFCFM  will  schedule  and  chair  a  U&TW  at  a minimum,  every  three  (3)  years  to  address the training needs of the career field. AETC will provide a progress report 12 months after the U&TW. 2.3. The  MAJCOM  functional  manager  (MFM)  will  ensure  training  programs  complement  the  CFETP’s mandatory  initial  skills and  upgrade  requirements. Identified requirements  can  be  satisfied  by AETC and unit  resident  training,  or  exportable  courseware/courses.  MAJCOM-developed  training  to  support  this AFSC  must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate available training. 2.4. Commanders and immediate supervisors will manage and control progression through the career field by ensuring each officer completes the  mandatory training requirements for upgrade specified in this  plan and  as  supplemented  by  their  MAJCOM.  The  list  of  courses  in  Part  II,  Section  D,  will  be  used  as  a reference  to  determine  required  training.  Commanders  should  take  advantage  of  local  opportunities  to provide 21M officers the opportunity to develop consistent with the functional pairing concept.  2.5.  Squadron  Commanders,  or  equivalent,  are  responsible  for  ensuring  their  assigned  officers  meet the  requirements  of  the  CFETP.  T h e   Squadron  Commander  (or  higher  authority)  will  certify  the officer’s  training  progression  by  creating  a  journal  entry  in  the  Training  Business  Area  (TBA)  system. Group Commanders should take advantage of 21M/21A cross flow opportunities within their groups when circumstances allow.  However, the 21M functional pairing concept should take precedence over cross flow actions where both opportunities exist locally.  Group Commanders have decision authority for 21M/21A cross flow opportunities within their groups.  If award of secondary AFSC is desired, Group Commanders must consult with the AFPC maintenance officer assignment team and AFCFM to discuss AFSC inventory requirements and to secure required initial skills training as applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                               7     2.6.  Individual  21M  officers  will  use  this  CFETP  to  determine  training requirements  and  understand  the career  field development paths and opportunities.  Each 21M officer will complete the  mandatory  follow-on  training  requirements  specified  in  this  plan  and  as  specified  by  the  unit.  Specific  instructions  for follow-on  training  are  described  in  Part  II,  Section  C.    2.7.  Cross flow officers will maintain a 21M CFETP while in the 21M cross flow and accomplish all core tasks identified in the CFETP, as well as locally identified mandatory items (both will be documented in TBA).  Recommend  cross  flow  officers  returning  to  their  core  AFSC continue  to  maintain  this  record for  future  requirements.  A  cross flow officer that does not have an AFSC related CFETP will use the 21M CFETP. 3. Coordination and  Approval.  The  CFETP  is  approved  and  maintained  by  the  AFCFM  in  accordance with  (IAW)  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program  Career  Field  Education  and  Training.  Forward recommended  changes  to  the  AFCFM,  HQ  USAF/A4LW.  MAJCOM  requests  for  additional  training must  either be accompanied by funding or  must  be satisfied  within existing resources; the  AFCFM is the approval  authority.  MAJCOM  representatives  and  AETC  training  personnel  will  identify  and  coordinate career field training requirements.  The  AETC CTM for  21M  AFSC  will  coordinate  with the  AFCFM  to initiate an annual MAJCOM review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. 4. Training Documentation. The use of TBA is mandatory for all  active,  guard,  and  reserve  munitions personnel  to  document  CFETP  requirements.  Contact  your  MAJCOM  21M  functional  if  unable  to comply with this mandate. 8        PART I SECTION B - CAREER FIELD PROGRESSION AND INFORMATION 1.  Purpose.

Skill  and  Career  Progression.  Quality  training  and  timely  progression  through  skill  levels  plays  an extremely important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission. The guidance provided in this part  of  the  CFETP  will  ensure  officers  receive  correct  training  at  appropriate  points  in  their  career. Generally,  skill-level  progression  is  associated  with  four  levels  of  certification:  Entry,  Basic,  Senior  and Master.  Table 2 provides a visual representation of each level of certification and the requirements for each. 3.1. Entry  Level.  IAW  AFI  36-2201, Air  Force  Training Program, Initial  Skills Training  (IST)  must  be completed  within  6 months  of  entering  active  duty  unless  restricted  by  lack  of  security  clearance  or other  extenuating  circumstances.  Upon  successful  completion  of  MOFC  and  the  appropriate  AFSC awarding follow-on course, graduates  will  be  awarded the  entry level  “21M1” AFSC  with the  appropriate “A”,  “I”  or  “N”    shred.    Initial  assignments  provide  opportunities  to  establish  and  build  depth  and technical  expertise  within  this  munitions  and  missile  maintenance  discipline.  Commanders will expose new officers to the entire mission of the unit.  3.1.1. Entry level officers should thoroughly understand all requirements within the 21M CFETP.  12            3.1.2.  The  maintenance  badge  is  the  occupational  badge  awarded  to  a  21M  upon  completion  of  the fundamentals  and  follow-on  shred-out  (i.e. CMOC, IMOC, or NMOC)  courses. 3.1.3. The  missile  badge  will  be  awarded  to  21Ms  that  complete  IMOC  and/or  meet  requirements  as outlined in AFI 36-2903. 3.2. Basic  Certification.  The  following  are  mandatory  for  basic  certification:  Completion  of  a  formal AETC  entry-level  training  course,  24  months  managing  conventional  munitions  maintenance  activities, nuclear  weapons  maintenance  activities,  or  ICBM  maintenance  activities,  and  completion  of  CFETP requirements.  Additionally,  commanders  may  enroll  officers  in  enlisted  2W  or  2M  Career  Development Courses to accelerate and enhance an officer’s technical knowledge. 3.3.  Intermediate  Level.  This  represents  the  period  between  the  24-month  basic  certification  and senior certification. 3.3.1. To  develop  a  firm  foundation  in  the  maintenance  career  fields,  two  of  the  first  three  assignments should  be  in  a  21M  position.  Commanders,  supervisors  and  the  individual  officer  should  strive  to  fulfill the  intent  of  the  functional  pairing  concept.  Functional  pairings  are  ICBM  –  Nuclear,  Conventional  – Nuclear or  Conventional  –  ICBM.  Commanders  should take  advantage of local broadening  opportunities between  21M  shreds  as  situations  allow,  specifically  at  locations  such  as  Minot  and  Whiteman  where 21Ms  can  move  between  conventional  and  nuclear  maintenance billets and locations such as Vandenberg, FE  Warren,  Malmstrom  and  Minot  where  21Ms  can  move  between  ICBM  and  nuclear  maintenance billets.  Initial skills training availability should be arranged before broadening decisions are finalized. 3.3.2.  After  broadening  their  knowledge,  experience  and  expertise  within  the  21M  career  field, Developmental  Assignment  (DA)  opportunities  should  be  considered.  Primary  DA  cross  flow  should be  into  aircraft  maintenance  or  logistics  readiness,  but  other  opportunities  include  AETC  instructor, acquisition,  Component  Repair  Facility/Air  Logistics  Complex  (CRF/ALC),  and  aerospace  power employment.  Timing  and  needs  of  the  AF  as  well  as  individual  goals  will  determine  DA  opportunities for  each  individual.  Back-to-back  development/cross  flow  assignments  are  strongly  discouraged. Commanders  may  take  advantage  of  local  21A/21M  cross  flow  and  broadening  opportunities  as situations  allow.  NOTE: Initial  skills  training  availability should  be  arranged  before  cross  flow  decisions are finalized. 3.3.3. Company  Grade  Officers  will  be  considered  for  the  Logistics  Career  Broadening  Program  by  the 21A/M Development Team.  Information  pertaining to  this  program and  eligibility  criteria  can  be  found  in AFI 36-2111, The Logistics  Career  Broadening Program. 3.3.4. Company Grade Officers will also be considered for the Base Level Broadening Program (BLBP) by the  21A/M  Development  Team.  Information  pertaining  to  this  program  and  eligibility  criteria  can  be obtained from the 21M, 21A and 21R AFCFMs. 3.4.  Senior  Certification.  An  officer  will  be  eligible  for  the  Senior  Certification  at  the  7-year  point provided they have been functionally paired to a second 21M specialty shred and have also completed the Maintenance  Officer  Intermediate  Course  (MOIC)  or  have  attended  the  Advanced  Maintenance  and Munitions  Operations  School  (AMMOS).  With  prior  coordination  and  approval  from  the  Group Commander, ARC  members may extend this requirement up to 36 months to accommodate their unique time availability constraints. All CFETP requirements must be complete for the officer to be eligible for the award of the senior certification. 3.5. Staff  and  Senior  Level.  At  the  field  grade level, an  officer  will  continue to  broaden  expertise  while strengthening  their  background  in maintenance  through  leadership  and  staff  assignments.  During  this time,  they  should  pursue  those  opportunities  that  make  them  viable  for  squadron  command  and 13     subsequent  selection  for  group  command  or  a  key  senior  maintenance  officer  position.  DE  and  DA opportunities  for  field  grade  officers  are  evolving.  Check  the  AFPC  Force  Development  web  page  for the most current information. include  aircraft  maintenance,  logistics  readiness,  acquisition,  CRF/ALC, 3.5.1.  DA  opportunities financial management, aerospace power employment, plans and programs and political military positions. 3.6. Master  Certification. An  officer  will  be  eligible  for  the  master  certification  at  the  15-year  point in the specialty.  Officers within  this level of competency are prepared to assume broader leadership roles. Table 2.  Munitions & Missile Maintenance Officer Certification    NOTE:  Officers  who  do  not  attend  IMOC  are  authorized  to  wear  the  basic  missile  badge  if  they  have directly supervised 2M/2W personnel in the maintenance, loading or unloading of guided missiles/missile systems for 12 months after attending IST.  Refer to AFI 36-2903 for additional information.    3.7. As a general rule, time spent outside of core duties (SOS, OTS, ROTC, USAFA instructor, etc.) does not count towards the award of senior/master certification.  However, time spent outside of core duties that can  be  related  to  the  21M  career  field  (certain  staff  jobs,  nuclear  fellowships,  etc)  can  count  towards senior/master certification.  Group Commanders (or equivalent) will determine what does/does not count with respect to individual officers and have waiver authority for time spent in out-of-core duties.      3.8. Grandfather  Plan.  When  the  21M  AFSC  was  formed  in  1998,  a  plan  was  developed  to  transition officers  in  various  year  groups  into  the  new  training  scheme.    Refer  to  Table  3  for  the  Grandfather timeline or consult your MAJCOM Functional Manager.  Table 3. Grandfather Plan  TAFCSD  CFETP Requirements  Senior All Grandfathered Grandfathered Master All All Grandfathered  1 Jan 02 through current 1 Jan 91 through 31 Dec 01 31 Dec 90 and prior Basic All Grandfathered Grandfathered      NOTE: The Waiver  authority  is  the  AFCFM (21M).        14         4.  U&TW  Training  Decisions.  The  82d  Training  Group  hosted  a  Specialty  Training  Requirements Team  (STRT)  and  Utilization  and  Training  Workshop  (U&TW)  for  the  21X  Logistics  enterprise  at Sheppard  AFB  22-26  Aug  2016.  The  21A,  21M  and  21R  Career  Field  Managers  (CFM)  co-chaired  the event.  During  the  STRT/U&TW,  the  working  group  determined  future  career  field  training  requirements and revised the Career Field Education and Training Plans (CFETP), the Air Force Officer Classification Directory  (AFOCD) and  Course  Training  Standards  (CTS)  for  initial skills  and intermediate  training pipeline  courses.  After  reviewing  occupational  analysis  report  (OAR)  data,  formal  training  data,  course training  standards  and  available  formal/informal courses,  the following decisions  were made: 4.1. The 21M working group updated the CTSs for MOFC, CMOC, IMOC and NMOC by consolidating duplicative  CTS  items  under  MOFC  and  by  altering  existing  behavioral  statements  across  all  courses. New  behavioral  statements  will  ensure  pipeline  courses  build  upon  the  fundamental  concepts  taught  in MOFC  as opposed to “repeating” material.  4.2. During  the  NMOC  CTS  review,  the  21M  break-out  group  realigned  behavioral  statements  linked  to nuclear  weapons  treaty  governance  and  NC3  processes  from  NMOC  to  MOFC.  The  group  also developed  requirements  for  AETC  to  provide  instruction  on  the  various  types  of  nuclear  generations  for insertion  into  the  NMOC  curriculum.  Specific  generation  models  include  MUNSS  operations,  bomber operations (gravity and cruise missile), ICBM and DCA fighter platform operations. 4.3  The  group  reviewed  the  21M  CFETP  for  adequacy  and  completeness.  Additionally,  the  group incorporated  the  updated  CTS  listings  for  MOFC,  CMOC,  IMOC  and  NMOC  into  the  CFETP  and identified  an  action  item  to  establish  special  experience  identifiers  (SEI)  for  AFCOMAC  and  NAC.  The establishment  for  these  SEIs  will  call-out  specific  munitions  officer  competencies  that  normally  would not  be  as  identifiable  within  the  duty  history  of  a  21M  officer.  The  group  also  updated  the  CFETP  to reflect functional pairing (second shred) as a mandatory requirement for 21M senior certification. 4.4  The  team  also  discussed  timing  for  21M  AFSC  award.  The  team  decided  to  continue  the  award  of the  21M  AFSC  following  the  respective  pipeline  course  (CMOC,  IMOC,  NMOC).  This  decision recognizes  MOFC  “plus”  respective  pipeline  course  as  Initial  Skills  Training  for  accessions  and  cross- flow officers (21Ms functionally paired to additional shred will attend new shred pipeline course only). 4.5  The 21A and 21M functional communities combined efforts on day 4 of the STRT/U&TW to jointly review the MOIC CTS listing.  This joint review proved  beneficial by having all 21M shreds  and aircraft maintainers from across the MAJCOMs represented in one room to review training requirements. During the review, the group converted  CTS line-items from proficiency  codes to behavioral statements in order to  clearly  define  training  requirements.  The  joint  reviewing  body  also  removed  the  requirement  to  teach subject  matter  deemed  not  applicable  to  the  pre-Operations  Officer  targeted  audience  (non  production- related  subjects)  such  as  R&D,  ODT&E  and  ACR  lessons.  The  group  also  took  special  interest  in ensuring  inclusiveness  throughout  MOIC  by  modifying  CTSs  to  include  the  ICBM  intermediate-level audience  by  changing  phrases  like,  “explain  airframe  factors  in  determining  maintenance  production capabilities”,  to  “explain  weapon  system  factors,  etc  …”.  The  group  emphasized  the  nuclear  enterprise training  requirements  by  adding  a  pre/post  look  at  the  DoD  nuclear  enterprise. This  new  requirement uses the “Minot Incident” (a current case study within MOIC) as the pre/post reference point and adds the “Taiwan Shipping Incident” as a case study within the same lesson. 5. 21M  Career  Progression.  Experience  and  knowledge  in  this  Air  Force  specialty  will  help  officers plan  and  achieve  their  Air  Force  career  goals  as  Munitions  and  Missile  Maintenance  Officers.  There  are certain jobs or experiences in this discipline that will assist them in meeting individual goals.  5.1. All facets of unit-level maintenance provide many opportunities to supervise Airmen of all ranks and          experience levels. It is common to find maintenance officers leading and supervising as few as 30    15   technicians to as many as 200 during the first assignment. Several permanent change of station (PCS)   moves are normally required for an officer to experience  the  breadth  of  unit  maintenance  opportunities     to sufficient depth.  When contemplating such a move, the officer should keep in mind the following:  5.1.1. Functional Pairing Concept. Broadening to another 21M3X shred to obtain complementary     experience IAW 21M CFETP guidance (e.g., 21M3I to 21M3N) will expand an officer’s understanding of   the differences in weapon system complexity, supportability, and deployability within the 21M career   field. 21Ms will obtain nuclear surety experience prior to Senior Certification.   5.1.2.  Short-tour overseas assignments represent prime opportunities to quickly fill gaps in an officer’s      professional development and to hone skills in a typically austere environment.  5.1.3.  A  change  in  major  command  (MAJCOM).  Experience in several different  MAJCOMs  will  give an officer  a  broader  view  of  the  total  Air  Force  mission  and  a  deeper  understanding  of  how  all  the "pieces" fit together.  This  knowledge  will  lay the  foundation for success on the Air Staff or  Joint Staff.      5.2. Officers  will  develop  depth  on  their  first  assignment  by  gaining  experience  both  as  a  leader  and  a functional  expert.  As  they  progress,  officers  will  gain  experience  and  depth  that  will  ultimately  lead  to becoming  a  fully  qualified  maintenance  officer  (21M3X).  A  minimum  of  three  years  of  experience  is recommended  before  cross flowing into  a second  AFSC.  Upon  completion  of  training,  a  minimum of  24 months  of  experience  is  required  to  become  fully  qualified  in  the  second  functional  area.  Maintenance officers  will  also  gain  valuable  experience  in  their  development  while  assigned  to  a  headquarters  staff position and during a tour as an operations officer. 5.3. Upon  completion  of  the  second  tour,  a  variety  of  new  options  become  available.  Officers  will  have the opportunity to: 5.3.1.  Concentrate  on  building  depth  by  leading  a  larger  flight/branch  or  leading  squadron  maintenance activities as an operations officer.  5.3.2.    Cross  flow  into  Aircraft  Maintenance  or  other  logistics  disciplines  to  develop  breadth  of experience. Compete for Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)  degree programs. Officers graduating from these programs are typically assigned to staff positions.    5.3.3.  Career  broaden  into  an  Air  Force  Special  Duty.  Opportunities  include:  United  States  Air  Force Academy  (USAFA),  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps  (ROTC),  Squadron  Officers  School  (SOS), Technical  Training  and  Officer  Training  School  (OTS)  instructors,  Recruiting  Flight  Commander, command  and  control  operations,  and  operations  support  officers.  These  jobs  are  available  to  a  limited number  of  maintenance  officers. Release  is  contingent  on  career  field  dynamics  and  officers  return  to their “core” AFSC following the career broadening tour.  5.3.4.  Career broaden into an Air Force Logistics Special Program.  Opportunities include: Logistics Career Broadening  Program  (LCBP),  Base  Level  Broadening  Program  (BLBP),  Acquisitions  and  Logistics Experience  Exchange  Tour  (ALEET)  and  Education  with  Industry  (EWI).    Unlike  the  opportunities mentioned in paragraph 5.3.3, experiences gained through LCBP, BLBP, ALEET and EWI provide a direct positive benefit to the 21MX AFSC.  These programs introduce officers to a much broader view of logistics to include acquisitions, sustainment and life-cycle management.  The knowledge, skills and abilities gained during  these  programs  will  enable  officers  to  be  more  effective  within  their  respective  mission-sets  and weapon systems upon return to the 21M career field.  These programs can also positively impact an officer’s future assignment opportunities by giving them breadth of experience within the broader field of logistics.      5.4. The  technical  foundation  built  early  in  a  career  will  pay  great  dividends  as  a  staff  officer.  Staff billets  above the  wing level  for  munitions officers  are available at  NAF, MAJCOM, HQ  Air  Force, joint 16                service  agencies,  Direct  Reporting  Unit  (DRU),  and  field  operating  agencies.  Staff  positions  will normally be  coded with a  shred to indicate the type  of experience the  officer needs to  be  effective in  the position. 5.5.  A  certain  percentage  of  officers  selected  for  Major  will  be  identified  as  “ selects”  for  resident Intermediate  Developmental  Education  (IDE).  Many  IDE  students  will  go  to  a  challenging  joint-duty staff  assignment,  commander,  MAJCOM,  or  Air  Staff  level  job  upon  graduation.  Officers  not  afforded the  opportunity  to  attend  Professional  Military  Education  (PME)  in  residence  must  complete  PME by correspondence or seminar to remain competitive in their Air Force career progression. 5.6.  Command  billets  exist  at  several  levels.  Captains  can  compete  for  detachment  commander positions;  Majors  and  Lieutenant  Colonels  can  compete for  squadron  command  positions. Assignments  for Lieutenant  Colonels  include opportunities  to serve as squadron commanders,  joint duty positions,  higher  headquarter  staff  positions,  as  ROTC  detachment  commanders,  and  deputy maintenance  group  commanders. 5.7. Officers  selected  for  promotion  to  Lieutenant  Colonel  or  Colonel  will  also  have  the  opportunity to  compete  for  in-residence  attendance  at  SDE.  Upon  graduation,  officers  may  be  assigned  to  the  Air Staff,  joint-duty billets  or  chosen  for  command  at  the  group  level. 5.8. As Table 4 indicates, there are many paths a 21M can take to  become a senior leader. However, the most important factor in determining future opportunities is an officer’s performance in  their  current  job. Table 4.  21M Career Progression Chart 17     PART I  SECTION C - PROFICIENCY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 1. Purpose.

Designed  to  teach  new  officers  how  concepts  presented  at  technical  school are applied at the unit level. 2.1. Concept.  Ideally  officers  should  complete  AETC  formal  training  prior  to  unit  training.  The  intent  of follow-on unit training is to provide a local training plan to familiarize officers with unit specific procedures and  operations.  Follow-on  unit  training  consists  of  the  core  tasks  identified  by  an  asterisk  (*)  within  the 21MX  CFETP along with unit-identified tasks at the discretion of the unit commander.  Officers  will not be upgraded  to a fully qualified  level until satisfactorily  completing  both AETC  formal training and CFETP core  tasks.  One  successful  occurrence  does  not  necessarily  constitute  understanding  of  the  training objective,  but  it  should  provide  the  individual  with  a  basic understanding of subject areas. 2.2. Training  Plan.  The  instructional  design  for  unit  level  training  is  determined  locally.  Appropriate lesson  plans,  support  materials,  and  instructor  guidance  are  the  responsibility  of  each  unit. Unit  training may instruction,  self-study, supervisor/commander  interaction  to  meet  training  objectives.  Squadrons/groups  should  produce  a  local Maintenance Officer Training Plan (MOTP) to standardize and formalize follow-on unit training processes. include  work  center  and  field  visits, task  observations,  classroom 2.3. Training  Period.  The  unit  must  structure  and  conduct  training  to  ensure  the  officer  completes  all training within 24 months (cumulative) after assignment to a 21M position (may be extended to 36 months for ARC). If an officer moves from one shred to another (e.g., I to N) before 24 months has elapsed, the officer’s timeline  resets  and  will  have  24  months  from  the  effective  date  of  duty  change  to  accomplish  training requirements for the new shred.  Units must ensure that officer movement between shreds does not prevent an officer from obtaining at least 24 cumulative months in at least 1 shred prior to a PCS. 2.4.  Familiarization  Training  and  Workcenter  Visits.  Officers  must  be  scheduled to  observe familiarization  tasks  from  start  to  finish.  Supervisors  will  ensure  pre-task,  task,  and  post-task  actions  are included.  Training  may  be  conducted  concurrent  with  team  training  operations  or  during  routine maintenance  operations.  Instructors/supervisors  will  ensure  officers  understand  the  fundamentals  of  each 28          task,  why  it  is  performed,  associated  hazards,  and  the  overall  system  impact.  Unit  training  should  also include work center visits. Visits consist of tours of all maintenance work centers and key support agencies as determined by the commander/supervisor. 2.5.  Training  Documentation.  Document  the  officer’s  training  in  TBA. 2.5.1. Supervisors  will  review training  progress  with trainees  at an  initial  interview  within  60  days  of  the trainee’s  assignment  to  the  unit.    During  the  interview  the  supervisor  and  trainee  will  discuss  core  task requirements to be completed within 24 months after assignment to a 21M position. Core task requirements are  identified  in  Part  II,  Section  C,  paragraphs  3.1  –  3.4  by  an  asterisk  (*).    At  a  minimum,  officers  will complete  all  core  tasks  identified  in  paragraph  3.1  plus  all  core  tasks  identified  in  their  respective  shred (A/I/N).  Unit commanders can identify additional tasks not labeled as core tasks at their discretion (also to be completed within 24 months). The initial review shall be documented as a journal entry in TBA. 2.5.2.  For the Basic Certification Training Task List, supervisors will review training progress with trainees quarterly.  Supervisors will  conduct  the  review  on  this  basis  until  all  items  are  complete.  Reviews shall be documented as a journal entry in TBA.  2.5.3.  Grandfathered Record Documentation.  Document Grandfathered tasks/training via journal entries in TBA.  2.5.4.  The matrix identified in paragraph 3 (this section) is intended for the officer to use throughout his/her training  experience.    It  was  designed  to  accompany  the  officer  during  training  events  for  ease  of  initial documentation prior to input into TBA.     29        3. 21M Maintenance Officer Training Task List.
