These Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) were developed to enhance on-the-job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. As a trainer, the QTPs provide you with the breakdown of tasks into teachable elements. The teachable elements will help you to guide the trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task performance without assistance. QTPs are also used by the task certifiers/certification official to evaluate trainees concerning tasks which need third-party certification. 2.  Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for the trainee’s job position. Core task items are identified with the number “5” on the STS Column 2; these items are the minimum mandatory skills which are required for all 4N0X1B personnel to be proficient in performing. You have the flexibility to arrange training for each module in the order that you decide. 3.  Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee to review the training references to gain a better understanding of the objective for each module. If the trainee has any questions about the objective, clarify the behavior that is expected in the objective. Review the performance checklist with the trainee, and allow him/her sufficient time to learn each step (some objectives may take longer to teach). Remember--the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and to allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task without assistance. 4.  When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate each task objective. When the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document task completion appropriately in the six-part folder. 6.  The QTP task completion is to be annotated on AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, filed in Part 3, Section B in AFTR. NOTE: The individual checklists are not filed in each member’s six-part training folder. A master checklist is filed in Part 3, Section B of the Master Training Plan (MTP) six-part training folder. 7. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which need remediation. Conduct a feedback concerning each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in AFTR. As the trainer, when you are satisfied that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met.  If the task which is being trained requires third-party certification by a task 8. certifier/certifying official, the trainer first must ensure that the trainee is qualified to perform the task without assistance. Then the trainee will be evaluated by a task certifier/certifying official. The tasks which require third-party certification are denoted with a “^” in Column 3E of the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). After third-party certification, training qualification is documented appropriately in AFTR. 9.  The  QTPs  are  a  necessary  tool  for  standardizing  refresher/sustainment  training.  Such standardization  will  benefit  the  CFETP  training  concept  throughout  each  member’s  career. These  documents  also  will be  utilized  for  assessing/certifying the  Aerospace Medical Service Specialist each time that he/she is assigned to a new duty position. The QTP developers’ goal is to  publish  a  usable document for  certifying  officials,  trainers, and trainees  for the purpose of enhancing  on-the-job  training  for  Aerospace  Medical  Service  Specialty  personnel.  We  value your first-hand expertise, and we encourage your feedback.

If the procedure is not completed in the allotted time, it’s an automatic UNSATISFACTORY.  The trainee will be allowed to complete the duration of the PCL.  There can be no more than four electrode measurements with a 0.7-1.0 cm deviation; the fifth will result in an automatic UNSATISFACTORY.  Any deviation greater than 1.0 cm will result in an automatic UNSATISFACTORY.    There can be no more than two electrode impedances above 5 KΩ: the third is an automatic UNSATISFACTORY.  The trainee must accomplish 10 of the 13 items in section three to successfully pass.    No violations of safety requirements. 1 EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.  After the trainee has received instruction, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task. Trainee should be evaluated on this task utilizing a digital instrument. The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and correct the trainee if performance could become detrimental to patient safety at any time. Use the performance checklist to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished. Document task competency upon completion of the evaluation in the trainee’s AFTR. Initial evaluation should be documented in the CFETP.

The trainee will set-up and perform a lower extremity somatosensory evoked response (LSSEP) using an evoked potential instrument for interpretation by an electroencephalographer MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION: 1. Measure and apply appropriate electrodes for procedure within (+/-) 0.7 cm for each site   of headset.  2. 3. 4. 5. Measure and apply electrodes  Locate and properly stimulate lower extremity nerve. Complete procedure within allotted time of 2 hours. No unsatisfactory scores allowed on entire procedure. 6.  No violations of safety requirements.    21 EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS: 1. 2. 3. 4.  After the trainee has received instruction, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task. The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and correct the trainee if performance could become detrimental to patient safety at any time. Use the performance checklist to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished. Document task competency upon completion of the evaluation in the trainee’s AFTR. Initial evaluation should be documented in the CFETP. All recurring evaluations should be documented on AF Form 1098. Vol.10 Module 5 PERFORMANCE ITEM Somatosensory Evoked Potential Testing (Lower Extremity) RETEST RATING  S  U  N A  S  U  N A TEST ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES 1.
