The CFETP will provide our personnel with a clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of our career field training. Note:  Civilian  occupying  associated  positions  may  use  Part  II  as  a  guide  to  support  duty  position qualification training.  The CFETP consists of two parts used by the supervisor to plan, manage, and control training  within the career field. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. •  Section A provides general information about how the CFETP will be used. •  Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and the career field path. •  Section C associates each skill-level with specialty qualifications (knowledge,  education, and training). •  Section D displays resource constraints. •  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. Part II includes the following: •  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) to include duties, tasks, and technical references to support Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, and correspondence course requirements. •  Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if an Airman has satisfied training requirements. •  Section C identifies available support materials. •  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses, and exportable courseware. •  Section E identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. •  Section F identifies home station training references and courses material required for this specialty in support of contingency/wartime training. Note:  At  unit  level,  supervisors  and  trainers  must  use  Part  II  to  identify,  plan,  and  conduct  training commensurate with the overall goals of this guide. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty  receive  effective and efficient  training at  the appropriate point  in their  careers.    This  plan will enable us  to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.  At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this guide.   4 CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017 ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced  Distributive  Learning  (ADL).

Existing CDCs were reviewed and updated  to ensure only current material remained and new technology information was added.  Specialty  Task Standards were reviewed and validated.    Additions and deletions of core tasks as well as  modifications to proficiency codes were made.  B3.3.  Seven Level Upgrade  Training  Requirements.  Seven-level training  requirements  were reviewed and validated.    The requirement to complete the Operational Entomology Course was removed.  B3.4.  Proficiency Training.  Any additional knowledge and skill requirements that were not taught through initial skills or upgrade training are assigned as continuation training.  Purpose of continuation training is to provide training exceeding minimum upgrade training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions.  MAJCOMs must develop a continuation-training program that ensures personnel in the Pest Management career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their careers.  The training program will identify both mandatory and optional training requirements.  B3.5.    Supplemental  Training.   Subject  Matter  Experts  (SMEs)  and  the  Training  Committee reviewed supplemental training courses for technical accuracy and identified training that was no longer  required.  They revalidated  the  remaining  courses  as  necessary to  fully  support  career progression in the AFS.  B4.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Academic Programs.  Airmen are automatically enrolled in CCAF upon completion of basic military training.  CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it’s the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel.  The college is regionally accredited through Air University by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees designed for specific Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest multi-campus community college in the world.  Upon completion of basic military training and assignment to an AF career field, all enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an AAS degree.  In order to be awarded, degree requirements must be successfully completed before the Airman separates/retires from the Air Force or is commissioned as an officer.  See the CCAF website: http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/ for details regarding the AAS degree programs: In addition to its Associates degree program, CCAF offers the following programs.  Complete details can be found at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/certifications.asp.  In addition to its degree program, CCAF offers the following:  B4.1.  CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC) Program.  The CIC is a professional credential that recognizes the instructor’s extensive faculty development training, education and qualification required to teach a CCAF course, and formally acknowledges the instructors practical teaching experience. Qualified officer, enlisted, civilian and other service instructors are eligible for this certification. Complete details for the instructor certification program can be found at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/certifications.asp.  15 PART I CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017  B4.2.  The Professional Manager Certification (PMC).  This professional credential is awarded by CCAF and formally recognizes an individual’s advanced level of education and experience in leadership and management, as well as professional accomplishments.  The PMC is primarily designed for Air Force SNCOs.  However, any enlisted Airmen who meet all program requirements may be nominated and awarded the PMC.  Once an individual retires, separates or is commissioned, they are no longer eligible for the PMC.  Complete details can be found at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/certifications.asp.  B4.3.  CCAF offers the Instructional Systems Development (ISD) Certification.  The ISD Certification is a professional credential that recognizes the writers or managers’ extensive training, education, qualifications and experience required to develop and manage CCAF courses. The certification also recognizes the individuals ISD qualifications and experience in planning, developing, implementing and managing instructional systems. The program is designed to broaden faculty and professional development. Complete details can be found at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/certifications.asp.  B4.4. Air Force Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (AF COOL) Program.  AF COOL replaced the CCAF Credentialing and Education Research Tool (CERT).  The AF COOL Program can be accessed at https://afvec.langley.af.mil/afvec/Public/COOL/Default.aspx.  The site provides a research tool designed to increase an Airman’s awareness of national professional credentialing and CCAF education opportunities available for all Air Force occupational specialties.  The AF COOL Program also provides information on specific occupational specialties, civilian occupational equivalencies, CCAF degree programs, and AFSC-related national professional credentials available to enlisted members through credentialing agencies and professional organizations.  The AF COOL Program contains a variety of information about credentialing and licensing and can be used to:  B4.4.1.  Get background information about civilian licensure and certification in general and specific information on individual credentials including eligibility requirements and resources to prepare for an examination.   B4.4.2.  Identify licenses and certifications relevant to an AFSC.   B4.4.3.  Learn how to fill gaps between Air Force training and experience and civilian credentialing requirements.   B4.4.4.  Get information on Tuition Assistance and GI Bill eligible funding opportunities to pay for credentialing examinations and associated fees.   B4.4.5.  Learn about resources available to you that can help gain civilian job credentials.   B4.5.  Trade Skill Certification.  When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill certification is awarded for the primary occupational specialty.  The college uses a competency-based assessment process for trade skill certification at one of three proficiency levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman/Supervisor.  All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.    16 PART I CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017 B4.6.  Air University Associate to Baccalaureate Cooperative (AU-ABC).  AU-ABC directs Airmen with associate in applied science degrees from the CCAF to a collection of accredited “military friendly” colleges and universities to consider when completing a four-year degree. The program maximizes the application of military career education and training, and provides a multitude of online academic and support services for the enlisted member.    B5.

The multitude of engineers before you established this expectation through excellent service in both peace and war.  Eligibility criteria for award and wear of AF occupational badges can be found in AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.  20 PART I CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017 B7.2.  CE Badge Heraldry.  The gear wheel and compass have historically been used to represent the engineering profession, in both the military and civilian sector.  The gear represents the essence of engineering:  applying scientific principles and technology to practical ends.  To Air Force engineers, the gear symbolizes an element (representing the built environment) that meshes with other environments (weapon systems and trained personnel) to enable the Air Force to perform its mission.  The compass is a precision tool historically used by engineers in designing and constructing facilities and equipment.  The gear and compass together symbolize all the diverse specialties within Air Force civil engineer.  Finally, the wings help to portray the fundamental linkage between the engineering and aviation components; and that the built environment is the foundation supporting Air Force mission and people.  B7.2.1.  Basic Badge.  The basic badge is awarded upon successful completion of the apprentice course.           B7.2.2.  Senior Badge.  The senior badge adds a star to the top of the badge.

This section is reserved.” 29   PART II CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017 SECTION A - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD  A1.  Implementation.  This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for the 3- level J3ABR3E433 00AD, Pest Management Apprentice course with classes beginning 2 October 2017 and graduating on or after 6 November 2017.  A2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, and in collaboration with  the  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Career  Field  Manager  (CFM),  it  is  mandatory  for  all  civil engineers,  regardless  of duty assignment,  to  use  an  automated  training  record.    The  automated training record currently being utilized to document upgrade and qualification training is the Air Force Training Record (AFTR) and the application is located on the CE-VLC.  A2.1.  Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References).  Lists the most  common tasks, knowledge, and supporting technical references (TRs) necessary for Airmen to  perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  A2.2.    Column  2  (Core  Tasks).    Column  2  identifies  core  tasks  (specialty-wide  training requirements) by an asterisk (*) in the appropriate skill level sub-column.  As a minimum,  trainees must complete all core, critical, and diamond tasks for skill level upgrade.  A2.2.1.  Wartime Tasks.  All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks.  In response to  a wartime scenario, these tasks will be  taught in the 3-level course  in a streamlined training environment.  A2.2.2.  Diamond Tasks.  Tasks identified by a diamond () are considered contingency/war tasks and are critical to the career field.  Equipment shortfalls at most locations have created problems with the actual hands-on certification of these tasks.  In instances where required equipment is not available for instruction, completion of the corresponding task AFQTP is all that is required for upgrade/qualification training.  A2.3.   Column 3  (Certification for OJT).   Used  to  record completion of tasks and  knowledge training  requirements.    Use  AFTR  automated  training  management  application  to  document individual qualifications.  Task certification of core, critical, and diamond tasks  require a training completion date and initials of the trainee, trainer, and certifier.  All non-core  tasks require training completion date and initials of the trainee and trainer only.  A2.4.  Column 4 (Proficiency Codes Used To Indicate Training/Information Provided).  Indicates formal  training  and  correspondence  course  requirements.    It  shows  the  proficiency  to  be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task, knowledge, and the  career knowledge provided by formal courses, correspondence courses, web-based training  (WBT), and AFQTPs.  See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit education and  training manager for current CDC listings.  A2.5.  Qualitative Requirements.  Contains the proficiency code key  used to indicate the level of training  and  knowledge  provided  by  web-based  training  (WBT),  resident  training,  and  career development courses.    30 PART II CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017 A2.6.  Job Qualification Standard (JQS).  The STS becomes a JQS for OJT training when placed in the automated training application and used according to AFI 36-2201.  For OJT, the tasks in Column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use  of procedures.  AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements applies:  A2.6.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training:  A2.6.1.1.    Duty position.    Duty position  requirements  will  be  developed  and  identified  by  the workcenter supervisor and loaded into the automated training management application. Completion of core, critical, and diamond tasks are mandatory for all duty positions.  Ensure the correct duty position title is listed under Profile 1 section of the trainees’ automated training  record.  A2.6.1.2.    AFQTP  Training  and  Documentation.    AFQTP  or  AFQTP  assessments  have  been created for all core (*) and diamond () tasks and completion are mandatory to fulfill task knowledge requirements for upgrade/qualification training.  Each AFQTP provides the step-by-  step procedures for the trainee, trainer, and certifier in completing each core or diamond task and  instructions how to document the training in the individual automatic training record.  A2.6.1.2.1.   Training.  Documentation of the start and completion of the AFQTP in the QTP section located in the automated training record is required for all core and diamond tasks.  The  automated training record will not let  you sign off any tasks in the JQS until the completion date  has been entered.  Diamond tasks require the completion of the web-based course (with the  review and post-test located in the program) or completion of the AFQTP assessment located on  the CE-VLC to determine if the trainee has attained the knowledge level required.  Once the trainee has completed the web-based course or AFQTP assessment, the course completion certificate must be provided to the trainer/supervisor  for  documentation of the completion in the automated training  record and completion of hands-on training, if the equipment is available.  A2.6.1.2.2.   Hands-On Training.   DO NOT  sign off  the tasks in  the  JQS until the  trainee  has completed hands-on/certification training.  For diamond tasks, if the equipment is not available  at home station, the completion of the AFQTP or AFQTP assessment is the ONLY requirement  for upgrade.  When the equipment becomes available either at home station or at a TDY location,  the trainee can be signed off on the JQS tab in the automated training record.  A2.6.2.    Transcribing  from previous  versions  to  new  CFETP.    Most  items  should  transcribe automatically during the update of the new CFETP.    The UTM and supervisor must  conduct  a review of the new  STS to identify any new core, diamond, or non-core tasks and add those tasks to their duty  positions.  A2.6.2.1.  Previous training certification not listed.  If previous training certification is not listed in the individual record, select the parent task to be transcribed, check the task title(s) block, and click on the transcribe button.  Enter the date of the original certification and sign off the task(s).  The trainee will then sign off the task(s) to finalize the transcription of previous training  certification.  The automated application will place an entry into the trainee 623a and must  be acknowledged by the transcriber and trainee.   31 PART II CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017 A2.6.2.2.  Transcribing external training certification.  If a trainee attended a formal training course  and  received  appropriate  accreditation,  select  the  623  III  section  of  the  users  automated training record and locate the course title in the master task list, then enter the completion date.  If the course title is not listed, contact the UTM to have it loaded from the master catalog.  If it is not listed in the master catalog contact the Force Development Manager at AFCEC to have it loaded in the master catalog.  A2.6.3.  Documenting Career Knowledge.  When a CDC is not available, the supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all mandatory items specified in AFI  36-2101,  Classifying  Military  Personnel  (Officer  and  Enlisted).    For  two-time  CDC  exam failures, the unit commander will take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201. Note: Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.  A2.6.4.  Decertification.  When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task, the supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title.  The supervisor shall select the Decertify  button  on  the  screen  menu  and  enter  a  623a  comment  explaining  why  the  task  was decertified, and then enter the Airman into qualification training.  The individual is recertified using the normal certification process.  A2.6.5.  Recertification.  When an Airman is required to be recertified on a previous task due to annual or bi-annual requirements.  The supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box  next  to  the  task  title  and  select  the  Recertify  button  on  the  screen  and  entry  the  dates  the recertification was completed.    A2.6.6.    Training  Standard.    Tasks  are  trained  and  certified  to  the  “go”  level.  Go  means  the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets the local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures.  This equates to a 3c in the proficiency code key. AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures.  A2.7.  Specialty Training Standard.  The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests are developed at the USAF Airman Advancement Division by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their  career  fields.    The  tests  sample  knowledge  of  STS  subject  matter  areas  judged  by  test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based  upon  study  references  listed  in  the  Enlisted  Promotions  References  and  Requirements Catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, AF Military Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces.   A3.    Recommendations.    Comments  and  recommendations  are  invited  concerning  quality  of training AETC graduates receive.  Reference this STS and address your correspondence regarding changes to 782 TRG/TGE, 917 Missile Road, Rm 1A300, Sheppard AFB TX 76311-2368 or E-mail 782csil@us.af.mil.    A  Customer  Service  Information  Line  (CSIL)  has  been  installed  for  the supervisor’s convenience to identify graduates who may have received over or under training on tasks/knowledge items listed in this STS.  For a quick response to problems, call the CSIL at DSN 736-2574 any time day or night.  32 PART II CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017 SECTION B - COURSE OBJECTIVE LIST (COL)  B1.   Measurement.  Measurement of each objective is indicated as follows:  B1.1.   Written Test (W) indicates task or subject knowledge that is measured using a written test.  B.1.2.  Performance Test (P) indicates required task performance that is measured with a performance progress check.  B1.3.    Progress Check (PC)  indicates separate  measurement  of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check.  B2.   Standard.    The  standard  is  70%  on  written  examinations.  Standards  for  performance measurement  are  indicated  in the  objectives  and  delineated  on the  individual progress  checklist.   Instructor  assistance  is  provided  as  needed  during  the  progress  check  or  performance  test,  and students  may  be  required  to  repeat  all  or  parts  of the  behavior  until  satisfactory performance  is attained.  B3.    Proficiency  Level.   Most  task  performance  is  taught  to  the  “2b”  proficiency  level,  which means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of  the task (partially proficient).    The student  can also  determine step-by-step procedures for doing  the task.  B4.    Course  Objective  List.    These  objectives  are  listed  in  the  sequence  taught  by  Blocks  of Instruction.  Per AETCI 36-2641, Technical and Basic Military Training Development, detailed listing of  the  initial  skills  course  objectives  may  be  obtained  by  written  request  through  the  requesting organizations MAJCOM to HQ AETC/A3T. 33 PART II CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017 SECTION C - SUPPORT MATERIAL  C1.  Air Force Qualification Training Packages.  C1.1.    The  mandatory  AFQTP’s  for  each  skill  level  are  identified  on  the  3E4X3  AFQTP Documentation Record.  C1.1.1.   For a complete list of up-to-date AFQTPs applicable to the 3E4X3 AFSC, go to CE-VLC. Resources Library.  C1.2.  The UTM or supervisor can download paper-based AFQTPs.  Paper-based AFQTPs can be found on the CE-VLC under the Library link and then by selecting Resources.  C1.2.1.    In  additional  to  the  paper-based  AFQTPs  there  are  web-based  courses  or  assessments developed for certain tasks that are available on the CE-VLC under the Course List link and specialty topic area.    C2.  AFQTP Assessment for Civil Engineer CDCs.  C2.1.  FDMs have developed CDC assessments for their career field and they are located on the CE-VLC under the topic header Civil Engineer Career Development Courses (CDCs).  C2.2.   The  CDC  assessments  are  for  the  sole  purpose  of  providing  the  Unit  Commander,  Unit Training  Manager  (UTM)  and  the  supervisor,  a  predictive  indicator  of  whether  the  trainee  has studied sufficiently to successfully pass their CDC end of course (EOC) exam.  34 PART II CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017 SECTION D – EDUCATION AND TRAINING COURSE INDEX  D1.

This area is reserved.” 36     PART II CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017 SECTION F - HOME STATION TRAINING training  conducted  in  a  classroom,  to  task-oriented  hands-on  F1.    Purpose.    The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  identify  the  tasks,  training  references,  and training  sources available  in support of contingency/wartime training.    Civil Engineer  forces will train  to  meet  the  full range  of tasks  expected  in  the  contingency  environment.   Training  ranges from  knowledge-type training conducted  in  the  field.    These  training  requirements,  frequencies,  and  sources  are  listed  in  AFI 10-209, RED HORSE Program and  AFI 10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force  (BEEF) Program.  F2.    Home  Station  Training  (HST).    HST  is  knowledge-based  and  hands-on  training  that  is conducted at the individual’s home station for contingency operations.  The CE Commander ensures training is provided and documented and arranges for subject matter experts to conduct training as required.  AFI 10-209, Attachments 2-6 and AFI 10-210, Attachments 2-6, identifies the personnel to be trained by specialty and frequencies.    F3.    Combat  Skills  Training  (CST).   CST  must  be  institutionalized  as  an  integral part  of any HST  program.   Lessons  learned  from operations  such  as  IRAQI  FREEDOM  have  taught  us  the importance of maintaining a higher level of combat readiness.    Although the inclusion of combat skills-focused  training  into  HST  does  not  fully  prepare  CE  personnel  to  work  in  a  high  threat combat  environment,  the  steps  taken  to  enhance  training  will  help  elevate  units  to  a  readiness level  capable  of  supporting  safe  and  effective  operations  in  low  to  medium  risk  combat environments.  F4.   Mission  Essential Equipment  Training  (MEET).    Wartime  or  contingency environments often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-essential equipment that civil engineers  do not  use  in  their  day-to-day  operations.    Due  to  the  cost  and  complexity,  mission  essential contingency  equipment  and  trainer  expertise  are  not  commonly  found  at  CONUS  installations.   Personnel must be hands-on certified and the certification documented in their CFETP.  AFI 10-210, Attachment  4,  identifies  minimum  number  of  personnel  to  be  trained,  positions  by  specialty, frequencies  and Chapter 2  identifies the  locations  of training  sites.    Inadequate training on these key equipment items can negatively impact Air Force contingency operations.  F5.    AF  Expeditionary  (ES)  Training  Requirement.    AETC,  as  lead  MAJCOM  for  AF  ES training,  revamped  ancillary  home-station  and  advanced  (mission  specific)  expeditionary  skills training plans to standardize and synchronize training across the force.    Detailed requirements for AF ES training is available in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, Chapter 8.  F6.  Training References.  F6.1.    AFI  10-209,  RED  HORSE  Program,  Chapter  3  and  Attachments  2-6  identify  the  RED HORSE recurring training requirements.  F6.2.    AFI  10-210,  Prime  Base  Engineer  Emergency  Force  (BEEF)  Program,  Chapter  4  and Attachments 2-6 identify the Prime BEEF recurring training requirements.  F6.3.  AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, Chapter 8 identify ES training requirements.    37 PART II CFETP 3E4X3, 1 OCT 2017 F6.4.  Web-based Products.

AFQTP Documentation Record. A3.1.  To ensure each Pest Management trainee is trained to the correct standard an AFQTP () has been  developed  for  each  core  and  diamond  tasks  identified  in  their  STS.    These  AFQTPs  are mandated  to  be  used  by the  trainee,  trainer,  and  certifier  in  their  on-the-job-training  program  for upgrade to the 5- or 7-level.  A3.2.  These AFQTPs ensures all aspects of the task is covered sufficiently and provide  additional task  knowledge  in  preparation  for  hands-on  training.    AFQTPs  summarize  procedures  on a task performance checklist for use by trainers, certifiers, and trainees.  A3.2.1.  The UTM or supervisor can download AFQTP's from CE-VLC reference library.  A3.2.2.   In additional to the paper-based AFQTPs there are web-based courses or assessments developed for certain tasks that are available on the  CE-VLC under the specialty topic area.  A3.3.   Documentation.    Before a core or diamond task can be signed off in the JQS section of  the individual automated training record the task must be signed off in the QTP section first.  A3.3.1.   Core/Diamond  Tasks.    To  document  the  completion  the  supervisor  or trainer  opens  the individual automated training record, navigates to the QTP section, enter the start and completed  date with signatures.  A3.3.2.    Diamond (♦) Tasks.    Supervisors/Trainers DO NOT sign off the corresponding JQS  task until the trainee has completed hands-on training.
