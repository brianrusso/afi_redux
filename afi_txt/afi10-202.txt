Introduction.  Successful  support  of  the  global  engagement  of  United  States  forces  is contingent upon establishing and maintaining a global air mobility support system (GAMSS) that enables the timely deployment, employment, sustainment and redeployment of forces throughout the  range  of  military  operations.    As  part  of  GAMSS,  the  United  States  Air  Force  (USAF) maintains  expeditionary  CRFs  to  manage,  coordinate,  support  and  control  global  mobility missions. CRFs deploy to locations where mobility operations support capability is  insufficient or  nonexistent.    They  provide  C2,  air  transportation,  aircraft  maintenance  capability  and  may contain  support  elements  from  specific  functional  areas  (e.g.,  security  forces,  weather, intelligence, etc.) to ensure safe, effective global air mobility operations.  These forces deploy on very  short-notice  to  support  contingencies,  humanitarian  assistance  and  disaster  response operations,  President  of  the  United  States  (POTUS)  support,  Security  Cooperation  (SC) engagements and operations, Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAMs), Joint Airborne and Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), exercises and tanker deployment support.  Furthermore, CRFs provide the capability to  “Open  the Airbase” by executing Force Module 1 (FM1) in the Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) FM list. 1.1.1.  Key terms and definitions. 1.1.1.1.  “Will” and “shall” indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.1.1.2.  “Should” indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment. 1.1.1.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.1.1.4.  Contingency  Response  Force  (CRF)  is  the  preferred  acronym  used  when generically  referring  to  dedicated  forces  that  provide  expeditionary  air  mobility  support operations capability. 1.1.1.5.  Contingency  Response  Group  (CRG)  is  an  acronym  that  refers  to  both  a  home station  CRF  organizational  structure  and  a  specific  CRF  team  designation  when executing the Open the Airbase mission. 1.2.  Administration. 1.2.1.  Applicability.    This  instruction  applies  to  all  USAF  personnel  performing  CRF missions.  It  is  a  compilation  of  cross-functional  information  from  various  sources.    The source directive normally has precedence in the case of any conflicts, revisions and matters of interpretation. 1.2.2.  Supplements.  This Air Force Instruction (AFI) is a basic directive. Major Commands (MAJCOM)  may  supplement  this  AFI.    Supplements  will  not  alter,  amend  or  be  less restrictive than the provisions of this AFI unless specifically authorized by this AFI OPR. 1.2.2.1.  Coordination Process.  Forward MAJCOM-approved supplements (with attached AF  FORM  673,  Air  Force  Publication/Form  Action  Request)  to  HQ  AMC/A3CM,  402 Scott Dr, Unit 3A1, Scott AFB IL 62225-5302. HQ AMC/A3C will review the proposed supplements and provide a recommendation to HQ AMC/A3 and notify the MAJCOM.   6  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 1.3.  Mission.  CRFs provide the capability to Open the Airbase, extend the fixed global mobility en route system, jointly open ports and operate worldwide where little or no mobility operations support  exists.    CRF  C2  elements  provide  command  leadership  and  management  of  deployed forces  (assigned  or  attached),  air  transportation  (aerial  port)  elements  provide  cargo  and passenger  handling  services  required  to  meet  operational  requirements,  quick-turn  aircraft maintenance elements provide basic crew chief skills to assist transiting aircraft, security forces (SF) provide force protection (FP) for aircraft parking areas and lodgment, Air Force Office of Special  Investigations  (AFOSI)  provides  counterintelligence  elements,  airfield  operations provide required airfield management and limited air traffic control (ATC) services, and mission support elements provide organic base operating support (BOS) required for the CRF.  To meet these objectives, the following specific missions must be accomplished: 1.3.1.  Deploy scalable CRF teams and equipment to immediately manage expeditionary air mobility operations and provide support to airlift users in moving passengers and cargo. 1.3.2.  Establish CRF operations at designated airfields.  This includes C2, communications, aerial  port  unit  move  capabilities  and  quick-turn  aircraft  maintenance  to  provide  support  to launch,  recover  and  refuel  transient  aircraft.    Additionally,  CRFs  have  the  capability  to sustain operations under bare base conditions for five days without resupply when unit self-sufficiency is required. 1.3.3.  Provide  CRGs  to  support  FM1  IAW  airbase  opening  directives.    Under  uncertain threat and environmental conditions, CRGs may need additional augmentation to perform the airbase  opening  mission  (e.g.,  Special  Tactics  (ST)  forces,  SF,  civil  engineer  (CE), Intelligence, AFOSI, etc.). 1.3.4.  Conduct  Contiguous  United  States  (CONUS)  and  Outside  Continental  United  States (OCONUS) airfield and landing zone (LZ) surveys (AF FORM 3822, Landing Zone Survey) and assessments to determine the capabilities and limitations of specified airfields and LZs in support of air mobility operations. 1.3.5.  Conduct landing zone safety officer (LZSO) and landing zone control officer (LZCO) duties IAW AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. 1.3.6.  Provide training in air mobility contingency load planning and equipment preparation to all Department of Defense (DoD), interagency and other designated DoD airlift users IAW the Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9-R Part III, Mobility. 1.3.7.  Provide organic communications support for deployed C2 operations. 1.3.8.  Deploy  a  CRF  liaison  officer  (LNO)  to  the  Air  Mobility  Division  (AMD),  when needed,  to  coordinate  CRF  operations  and  follow-on  forces’  requirements  with  Theater planners. 1.3.9.  Provide limited aircraft and/or aircrew stage crew management at CRF locations (Unit Type  Code  (UTC)  7E1AE  up  to  4  crews).    CRFs  require  augmentation  to  provide  tactics, aircrew flight equipment (AFE), and robust Intel or aircrew mission planning personnel.  For additional information see AMCI 10-210, Stage Management Operations. 1.3.10.  Assist with engagements and operations in support of SC programs that assess, train, advise and assist partner nations (PN) in the development of an Air Mobility System (AMS). AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   7  1.4.  Objective.  CRFs are mobility first responders for opening and initially operating air bases or forward operating locations, bridging the  gap  between handover forces (either diplomatic or forceable  seizure)  and  follow-on  or  sustainment  forces,  and  robusting  or  extending  existing global mobility  en  route locations.  Selected CRFs habitually train  with  US  Army soldiers  and maintain  a  rapid  response  posture the  US  Transportation  Command’s (USTRANSCOM) Joint Task Force-Port Opening (JTF-PO) capability.  Selected personnel may also  be  trained  and  tasked  to  conduct  airfield  and/or  LZ  assessments,  surveys  and  operations.  Additionally,  CRFs  may  support  operations  in  an  augmenting  capacity.    This  instruction addresses  CRF  roles  and  capabilities,  standardizes  core  capabilities  and  expectations,  and provides  top-level  guidance  on  force  presentation,  training,  tasking  processes  and  command relationships. to  establish 1.4.1.  CRFs  must  have  the  ability  to  rapidly  deploy  and  conduct  operations  immediately upon arrival in  a variety of threat  environments  from  permissive to  uncertain; however, the CRG Assessment Team may be inserted at the tail end of an airfield seizure operation when conditions are transitioning from hostile to uncertain.  This includes the ability to operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and in minimum lighting conditions. 1.4.2.  CRFs  have  the  ability  to  survive  and  operate  in  chemical,  biological,  radiological, nuclear  and  high  yield  explosive  (CBRNE)  environments  only  when  deployed  with appropriate  augmenting  forces  capable  of  detection  and  personnel  and  equipment decontamination support. 1.4.3.  The unique CRF cross-functional home station and deployed organizational structure facilitates  a  light  and  lean  operational  footprint  enhancing  their  rapid  deployment  and immediate operations capability.  Habitual expeditionary training also affords CRF the ability to operate with generally two thirds less manpower than traditional deployed forces, reducing their deploy/redeploy airlift and external support requirements. 1.5.  CRF Military Essentiality Status (MES) and Priority.  Through its Service components, the DoD identifies and prioritizes essential military manpower, materiel and programs to ensure proper management and allocation of critical resources. 1.5.1.  Per  AFI  38-204,  Programming  USAF  Manpower,  the  CRF  C2  capability  or  position requirements  are  designated  military  essential  performing  direct  combat  support.    Core manpower  positions  do  not  require  active  engagement  in  combat;  however,  contingency response  duties  are  critical  to  combat  operational  success  and  may  expose  personnel  to hostile action. 1.5.2.  IAW  AFI  16-301,  US  Air  Force  Priority  System  for  Resources  Management,  CRFs deploy  as  direct  combat  support  units  and  have  a  DoD  Force/Activity  Designator  (FAD) essentiality  rating  of  FAD  II  and  a  precedence  rating  of  2-01  through  2-10  (FAD  IV  and  a precedence rating of 4-01 through 4-10 for ANG and AFRC during peacetime, reverting to FAD II when deployed/mobilized). 1.6.

Unless  otherwise  directed  in  this  AFI,  waiver  authority  for  the  contents  of  this document  rests  with  the  assigned  or  gained  MAJCOM  A3.    MAJCOM  A3s  will  forward   10  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 copies of approved waivers to HQ AMC/A3C.  Waiver requests will be kept on file for two years. 1.7.2.  Deviation  Protocol.    If  unable  to  request  an  operational  mission  waiver  during execution  due  to  time  constraints  when  mission  criticality  dictates,  the  CRF  commander  or team chief may authorize the operation if the risk can be safely mitigated, or when necessary to  protect  the  team  or  equipment  from  a  situation  not  covered  by  this  AFI  and  immediate action  is  required.    The  CRF  commander  or  team  chief  must  report  the  deviation  to  the assigned or gained MAJCOM A3 within 48 hours. (T2)  The CRF commander or team chief must  be  prepared  to  collect  background  information  and  submit  a  follow-up  written  report upon request. (T-3) 1.8.  Tasking  Process  and  Command  Relationships.  The United States Secretary of Defense assigns  CRFs  to  the  Commander,  United  States  Pacific  Command  (CDRUSPACOM), Commander,  United  States  European  Command  (CDRUSEUCOM)  and  Commander,  United States  Transportation  Command  (CDRUSTRANSCOM)  who,  in  turn,  delegates  operational control  (OPCON)  to  air  component  commanders  (PACAF,  USAFE  –  Air  Forces  Africa (AFAFRICA)  and  AMC).    CDRUSPACOM,  CDRUSEUCOM  and  CDRUSTRANSCOM,  in coordination with component commanders and Director of Mobility Forces (when assigned), will determine  CRF  requirements.    CRFs  are  normally  presented  for  employment  through  their Commander,  Air  Force  Forces  (COMAFFOR).    MAJCOMs  are  the  tasking  authority  for assigned CRF and will develop and publish official tasking processes and procedures. if  organic  capability 1.8.1.  Geographic  Combatant  Commanders  (GCC)  may  request  CRF  support  from USTRANSCOM   Normally, USTRANSCOM-assigned  CRFs  operate  under  a  support  relationship;  with  OPCON remaining with the Commander, AMC unless otherwise specified in a Secretary of Defense (SecDef)  execute  order  (EXORD).    The  supported  Component  Numbered  Air  Force  (C-NAF)  commander  or  Component  Major  Command  commander,  through  their  A-Staff,  is responsible  for  relaying  any  specific  instructions  to  the  tasked  CRF,  through  18  AF, necessary to carry out the assigned mission. is  unavailable  or  nonexistent. 1.8.2.  USTRANSCOM  assigned  or  gained  CRFs  provided  to  the  GCC  in  a  support relationship  do  not  require  a  formal  request  for  forces  (RFF)  since  CRFs  normally  remain under Commander, AMC OPCON, and typically support USTRANSCOM strategic mobility and  GCC  Theater  mobility  requirements  concurrently.    For  urgent  requirements  when  a GCC’s  organic  CRF  capability  or  capacity  is  insufficient  or  nonexistent,  the  GCC  may verbally  request  CRF  capability  through  USTRANSCOM  and  follow  up  with  a  written request. 1.8.3.  Proposed  taskings  of  AMC-assigned  or  gained  CRFs  to  the  USEUCOM  and USPACOM area(s) of responsibility (AOR) must be coordinated with applicable Theater air component  planners  to  ensure  compliance  with  appropriate  Theater  directives  and  to eliminate CRF operational redundancies. 1.8.4.  Capability, availability and utilization of Air Reserve Component (ARC) CRF will be coordinated with the appropriate ARC MAJCOM Functional Area Manager (FAM). AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   11  1.8.5.  Cross-functional recurrent expeditionary  skills  training  ideally  suits  CRFs  to  assimilate  co-located  air  mobility operations and support forces at the deployed environment. composition, team specialized equipment and 1.9.  Response Timing.  Active duty component CRFs will be postured so they are ready to load all tasked personnel and equipment within 12 hours of receipt of a deployment order or tasking, either verbal or written, ANG CRFs will be ready to load in 36 hours from mobilization or call-up,  and  AFRC  CRFs  will  be  ready  to  load  in  72  hours  from  mobilization  or  call-up.    The installation  commander  where  the  CRF  unit  is  based  will  establish  sufficient  mobility  support and  procedures,  in  coordination  with  the  CRF  unit  commander,  to  deploy  CRFs  within  this prescribed  response  time.  (T2)    CRFs  are  normally  among  the  first  elements  deployed  during contingencies.  For this reason, CRF unit commanders must work closely with host installation commanders to  ensure proper sequencing and timing of deploying chalks.  CRF personnel  will not be tasked to be permanent members of host installation mobility processing units; however, the CRF may designate members to support their unit’s processing. (T-3) 1.10.  Sustained Operations.  CRFs will be equipped to be self-sufficient for the first five days of the deployment to include meals ready to eat (MREs), water and shelters.  Assessment Teams (AT) will be self-sufficient for initial sustainment up to three days.  CRFs are designed for short-term operations up to 60 days; therefore, planners must consider follow-on forces’ requirements to allow for CRF reconstitution and subsequent tasking. 1.11.  General Policies. 1.11.1.  Orders.    The  following  special  authorizations  are  approved  for  inclusion  in  all mission temporary duty (TDY) orders (includes AF FORM 938,  Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Tour, used to order ARC members to active duty): 1.11.1.1.  During  travel  to  and  from  a  deployed  location  and  while  at  the  deployed location (work load permitting) personnel on active flying status may update their flying currency  on  aircraft  in  which  they  are  current  and  qualified.    Personnel  should  obtain prior  approval  from  the  flying  unit  and  be  entered  on  the  file  copy  AF  FORM  4327A, Crew  Flight  Authorization  (FA),  or  applicable  theater  command  form  once  that  unit returns to home station. 1.11.1.2.  CRF personnel are authorized Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) status to and from deployed locations IAW AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations and AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. 1.11.1.3.  CRF  personnel  may  be  authorized  as  Mission  Route  Support  (MRS)  status  to and  from  deployed  locations  when  required  to  perform  short-notice,  time-sensitive actions  critical  to  AMC  missions  IAW  AMCI  24-101V14,  Military  Airlift  Passenger Service,  when  they  cannot  be  accommodated  through  the  normal  passenger  priority system. 1.11.1.4.  When  mission force  protection consideration, orders will direct personnel to travel and perform duties in civilian clothes. (T-3) requirements  dictate,  normally for 1.11.1.5.  Team integrity is essential.   12  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 1.11.1.6.  Travel  via  military  airlift  is  preferred  to  allow  movement  of  mission  essential UTC  vehicles  and  equipment.    Line  haul  may  be  directed  if  more  efficient  for  shorter distances.   Travel  via  commercial air may  be  authorized or directed at  the discretion of the tasking authority. Excess baggage will be authorized when transporting required UTC equipment. (T-3) 1.11.1.7.  CRF personnel require both  military  and civilian passports.   Passports will be purchased at government expense. (T-3) 1.11.2.  Every effort should be made to use government or contract quarters at the deployed location.    The  deployed  commander  or  team  chief  may  use  commercial  facilities  when military lodging facilities are nonexistent or do not meet Air Force standards IAW AFI 34-246,  Air  Force  Lodging  Program.    The  GCC  exercises  authority  for  FP  over  all  DoD personnel  assigned,  attached,  transiting  through  or  training  in  the  GCC’s  AOR  except  for those for whom the Department of State Chief of Mission retains security responsibility.  The GCC  may  direct  CRFs  to  relocate  work  centers  or  change  billeting  arrangements  for  their safety.  CRF will contact the theater Threat Working Group (TWG). (T-1) 1.11.2.1.  Teams  will  deploy  under  field  conditions  when  directed  to  meet  mission  or training objectives.  Even though CRFs have bare base capability, Expeditionary Combat Support  (ECS)  for  the  CRF  is  normally  the  responsibility  of  the  exercise  or  supported commander and will be outlined in the exercise or contingency order prior to deployment. (T-3) 1.11.2.2.  Secure  voice  and  data  capable  communications  must  be  readily  available  to deployed  CRF  commanders  and  team  chiefs  to  maintain  secure  connectivity  with  their controlling agency. (T-2) 1.11.3.  Deployed Personnel Utilization and Additional Duties.  Work schedules for deployed operations  are  based  on  12-hour/7-day-a-week  shift  work  with  minimum  personnel  and assets needed to accomplish the mission.  Approval from the commander with CRF OPCON authority is required to utilize CRF assets and/or personnel to support any non-CRF mission requirement. 1.11.4.  CRF  loadmasters  and  in-flight  refueling  system  operators  will  not  perform  primary aircrew  duties;  however,  they  may  assist  primary  crew  members  with  aircraft  loading  at home station or deployed locations. (T-2) 1.11.5.  When on active duty, ARC personnel must be in paid duty status to accomplish all of the following tasks: (T-1) 1.11.5.1.  Pre-mission planning, to include planning conference attendance. 1.11.5.2.  Equipment preparation and packing. 1.11.5.3.  Team briefings. 1.11.5.4.  Travel to and from the deployed location. 1.11.5.5.  Mission operations. 1.11.5.6.  Equipment reconstitution/recovery and turn-in. 1.11.5.7.  After-action reporting. AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   13  Chapter 2 ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS 2.1.  General.  The  usefulness  of  a  CRF  is  relative  to  its  ability  to  rapidly  respond  to  global requirements with tailored forces that are adaptable to multiple operational environments.  CRFs must  be  organized,  trained,  manned  and  equipped  to  support  short-notice  requirements  as  the first  on-scene  USAF  operations  and  support  force.    CRFs  are  designed  to  provide  seamless transitions  from  seizure  force  to  follow-on  sustainment  forces  through  the  use  of  interoperable communications,  integration  with  airfield  seizure  and  follow-on  force  operations,  and  must  be capable of providing ramp operations and limited organic BOS.  The CRF must be prepared to provide the skill sets that permit operations at staging bases and operating locations in support of any  joint  or  coalition  force  deployment  involving  air  and  space  operations  under  permissive, uncertain and hostile environments.  CRFs will be organized as light, lean and quick to deploy, employ,  redeploy  and  reconstitute.    The  unit  will  be  composed  of  personnel  who  are  both expeditionary  operations  and  functionally  skilled  experts,  trained  and  equipped  to  operate effectively  in  the  joint  and  coalition  environment.    MAJCOMs  will  leverage  emerging technology to ensure CRFs are properly equipped. 2.1.1.  USAF  airbase  opening  forces  may  require  some  BOS  and  installation  services  from the  supported  Service  with  the  preponderance  of  personnel  and  assets  at  the  deployed location. 2.1.2.  CRF operating locations may vary from robust international airports to semi-prepared dirt  LZs,  which  may  not  be  initially  mission  supportable  due  to  damage  resulting  from conflict or environmental conditions.  A CRF AT may be required to assess the airfield or LZ capabilities  and  make  suitability  recommendations  to  the  controlling  agency  prior  to  the deployment of the CRF main body.  Although a single CRF is normally tasked to support one operating  location,  it  may  be  required  to  support  multiple  locations  (split  operations)  if  the mission dictates, the scope of operation is limited and the necessary personnel and equipment are available. 2.1.3.  A  CRF  is  not  designed  to  participate  directly  in  forcible  entry  or  airfield  seizure operations,  but  must  have  the  capability  to  closely  interface  with  these  operations  in  an accelerated  timeline.    Under  hostile  conditions,  the  CRF  normally  requires  force  protection augmentation to effectively perform the airbase opening mission. 2.2.  Core  Capabilities.  CRFs  provide  the  following  core  capabilities  with  assigned  or augmenting forces: 2.2.1.  Rapid deployment. 2.2.2.  Ability to operate in an austere environment. 2.2.3.  Airfield assessment. 2.2.4.  Initial C2. 2.2.5.  Initial FP (includes SF, Intelligence and AFOSI) which typically provide the “first-in” airfield operations FP (resource protection and weapons system security).   14  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 2.2.6.  Initial  air  mobility  support  operations  including  aerial  port  and  quick-turn  aircraft maintenance. 2.2.7.  Initial  airfield  operations  (includes  airfield  management  and  weather  support;  may include ATC and Navigational Aids (NAVAIDS). 2.2.8.  Initial Force Health Protection (FHP). 2.2.9.  Initial airbase support (includes CE, petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL), contingency contracting,  finance,  vehicle  management,  material  management,  logistics  readiness,  CR Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE)/Power Production, Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO) and Public Affairs (PA)). 2.3.  CRF  Composition.  The  composition  of  the  CRF  team  varies  depending  on  mission requirements,  but  normally  includes  all  core  capabilities.    The  deploying  commander  or  team chief  carefully  balances  mission  requirements  and  airlift  limitations.    The  desired  effect  will shape  personnel  and  equipment  decisions  and  UTCs  may  be  tailored  to  achieve  the  desired effect.  Note: Unique unit capabilities exceeding or modifying those outlined in this instruction may still be required to perform MAJCOM-specific missions.  These alternative capabilities and forces are acceptable providing they do not detract from the established core CRF capability set. 2.4.  Home  Station  Organizations.  Unit  commanders  will  man,  train  and  equip  assigned personnel  IAW  Chapter  5  of  this  instruction.  (T-2)    Unit  commanders  will  ensure  pre-deployment planning and preparations in support of mission taskings are properly completed. (T-3)  Unit commanders will ensure post-deployment reconstitution of personnel and equipment is completed within established AFI and MAJCOM guidance. (T-3) 2.4.1.  MAJCOMS  may  organize  CRF  units  to  meet  unique  Theater  or  component  mission requirements.  However, regardless of home station organizational structure design, all CRF units will be postured to execute operations specified in Chapter 1, and all CRG-designated organizations  will  maintain  a  standardized  minimum  capability  to  execute  the  Open  the Airbase  mission  specified  in  FM1.    All  CRFs  must  also  develop  and  maintain  adequate procedures to meet their designed operational capability (DOC)-required response time. (T-3) 2.5.  Deployed CRF Organization.  When the unit commander receives an execution order for a contingency  tasking,  CRFs  will  recall,  brief,  mobilize,  process  home  station  manpower  and deliver materials  to  the  ready line for deployment.   The planning phase of operations normally occurs  between  the  alert  or  warning  order  and  the  execution  order.    However,  short  notice mission requirements may dictate the planning phase concurrently takes place within the unit’s allotted response time.  CRF advanced echelon (ADVON) packages may be deployed earlier in the sequence if mission requirements dictate.  Deployed CRFs will maintain the ability to rapidly roll-up and redeploy. (T-2) 2.5.1.  Once  CRFs  deploy,  capabilities  (personnel  and/or  equipment)  should  not  be reassigned to another mission or be given another tasking without the commander’s or team chief’s coordination since CRFs are tailored.  Additionally, the commander or team chief will not redeploy personnel without controlling agency approval. (T-2) 2.5.2.  Deployed CRF designation.  When necessary to combine UTCs from various units to form  a  complete  deployed  capability,  the  deployed  organization’s  name  will  be  defined  by AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   15  the  unit  providing  the  commander  or  team  chief.    The  deployed  organization  name  will  be derived by: (T-3) 2.5.2.1.  Commander  or  team  chief  parent  organization  (e.g.,  CRW  for  CONUS  active duty component, CRG for PACAF or USAFE - AFAFRICA and AW or AMW for ARC). 2.5.2.2.  The team composition designation. 2.5.2.3.  An  alpha  designator,  for  multiple  contingency  response  teams  from  the  same unit. 2.5.2.4.  Deployed location. location identifier  example 2.5.2.5.  Unclassified is  “621  CRW  CRE/B/EDDF,” designated as such because the team chief is from the 621 CRW (parent organization), it is a CRE (contains at least core mobile C2, maintenance and aerial port), it is the second CRE (B) currently deployed from the 621 CRW and is deployed to Frankfurt, Germany (ICAO:  EDDF). 2.5.3.  Contingency Response Group (CRG).  A CRG is  the designated composite group of forces  that  provides  the  Combatant  Commander  (CCDR)  with  a  majority  of  the  Open  the Airbase FM.  This deployed capability bridges the gap between seizure forces (when present) and sustainment forces (in subsequent FMs).  The CRG includes core CRF capabilities of C2, aerial  port  and  aircraft  maintenance  plus  organic  base  operating  support  and  is  capable  of supporting  a working maximum  on ground (MOG) of 2 with  24 hour C2 coverage.   Select CRGs may also train and deploy with a US Army Rapid Port Opening Element as part of the JTF-PO to provide capability of establishing and moving cargo up to 10 kilometers from the airbase to a forward distribution node to increase the volume of cargo through an aerial port of debarkation.  A CRG is led by a rated mobility O-6 as prescribed by the 7E1AM/7E1AK UTC Mission Capability (MISCAP) statements. 2.5.4.  Contingency  Response  Element  (CRE).  The  CRE  is  a  deployed  organization  at forward locations where air mobility support is insufficient or non-existent.  The CRE’s core capability sets consist of C2, aerial port and aircraft maintenance.  CREs provide minimum essential  on/offload  and  en  route  aircraft  mission  support  during  deployment,  employment and redeployment operations.  The standard CRE is capable of supporting a working MOG of 2 with 24 hour C2 coverage. 2.5.5.  Contingency Response Team (CRT).  A CRT performs the same functions as a CRE, but on a smaller scale and usually with no aircraft maintenance capability.  CRTs are led by an  enlisted  supervisor  (7-level  or  above)  trained  and  certified  by  the  unit  commander.    A CRT is capable of supporting a working MOG of 1 for 12 hours a day but will maintain 24 hour a day C2 coverage. 2.5.6.  Contingency Support Element (CSE). CSEs consist of CRF personnel and equipment providing  a  specific  contingency  support  capability  (e.g.,  affiliation,  communications  or aerial  port).  They may  be deployed as a support element  of a CRE or CRT, or as a small-scale, stand-alone entity. 2.6.  Deployed Functions and Tasks.  The following is a compilation of functions and tasks that may be executed by deployed CRF.  Not all CRF units possess the capabilities listed below.  The   16  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 deployed  organizations  mentioned  in  paragraph  2.5.  will  conduct  the  following  when  they possess the necessary personnel and equipment: (T-1) 2.6.1.  Airfield  AT.    The  AT  is  a  small,  O-6  led  team  comprised  of  personnel  who  usually precede  the  CRF  main  body  to  verify  airfield  operations  and  installation  infrastructure  and determine  whether  the  airfield  can  support  the  planned  mission.    The  AT  reports  this information  to  the  controlling  agency  and  follow-on  CRF  through  secure  communications.  ATs will provide an initial verbal assessment within 4 hours of arrival to commence the flow of mobility aircraft and will provide a more detailed airfield assessment  within 24 hours of arrival. (T-2)  AT assessments will address runways, taxiways, ramps, FP, communications, facilities,  airfield  operations,  munitions  and  explosive  storage  capabilities,  hot  cargo operations  capabilities  and  other  specific  data  requested  by  the  supported  command  and/or controlling  agency.  (T-3)    These  assessments  are  used  to  provide  a  recommendation  to planners and commanders on the suitability of conducting further air operations.  A more in-depth assessment will continue to the extent practical after the initial assessment is complete.  When required, the AT deploys with CE (32E and/or 3E5X1) and airfield operations (13M or 1C7X1) personnel certified to populate the AF FORM 3822 and AMC FORM 174, Airfield Survey.    The  AT  may  also  be  tasked  to  conduct  airfield  assessments  to  support  the development  of  an  expeditionary  Theater  basing  strategy  or  evaluate  established  facilities and recommend opportunities for increasing air mobility operations throughput and mission support capabilities.  The AT leader normally is dual-hatted as the CRG commander. 2.6.2.  Airfield  Survey  Team  (AST).  Similar  to  the  AT,  the  AST  will  collect,  validate  or update  airfield  suitability  information.  (T-2)    The  AST  chief  will  be  certified  to  conduct airfield  surveys  and  tailors  the  team  composition  as  required  for  each  mission  for  unit commander approval. (T-3)  When required, the AST will deploy with 32E or 3E5X1 (CE) and 13M or 1C7S1 (Airfield Operations) personnel certified to complete AMC FORM 174. (T-3)   At  a minimum,  a  1C7X1 (Airfield Manager) or  a 13M  (Airfield Operations Officer) will  conduct  the  airfield  survey.  (T-3)  Other  desired  team  members  include  a  Terminal Instrument  Procedures  (TERPs)-qualified  13MX/1C1XX  (ATC),  a  32EXX/3E5X1  (CE),  a 2A5X1  (maintenance  crew  chief),  a  2T2X1  (air  transportation  specialist),  3DXXX (communications specialist), 11M/12M (mobility pilot  or navigator), 21R  (LRO) and either 31PX/3P0X1 (SF) or 71SX/7S0X1 (AFOSI).  When time permits, a pre-mission analysis of the  field  to  be  surveyed  will  be  conducted  prior  to  deployment  and  will  include  a determination on whether a new pavement evaluation is required. (T-3) 2.6.3.  In-Transit Visibility (ITV). ITV provides support personnel to set-up and operate ITV equipment at passenger and cargo on/offload locations. 2.6.4.  Joint  Inspection  (JI)  Team.    The  JI  Team  conducts  joint  inspection  of  air  cargo  and notifies  air  mobility  users  of  discrepancies  requiring  correction  before  their  cargo  may  be transported by air.  JI teams do not certify cargo for air drop. 2.6.5.  Affiliation Training Team (ATT).  An ATT provides instruction to airlift users in the areas  of  airlift  planning,  cargo  load  planning  and  equipment  preparation  by  instructing  the equipment  preparation  course  (EPC)  and  the  airlift  planner’s  course  (APC)  to  designated airlift users.  An ATT normally consists of one or two affiliation instructors. 2.6.6.  Contingency Load Planning Team (CLPT).  The CLPT helps airlift users prepare and marshal initial loads prior to arrival of the first aircraft, and provides on-the-spot training and AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   17  quality  control  to  deploying  organizations.    The  CLPT  will  consist  of  three  qualified  ATT members. (T-2) 2.6.7.  Stage  Operations  Management.    In  cases  where  there  are  insufficient  aircrew management services, the CRG, CRE or CRT can manage a limited number of stage crews (4 crews or less).  When there is a significant amount of airfield and/or aircraft activity, or when a  large  number  of  stage  aircrews  are  planned,  separate  stage  crew  management  teams (7E1AN UTC) will be deployed to perform this task. (T-2) 2.6.8.  Initial C2. 2.6.8.1.  C2.    Provides  leadership  to  establish  safe  operating  environments;  integrate various  assigned  or  attached  forces  to  rapidly  open  or  expand  an  airbase  and  support follow-on  combat  or  combat  support  forces;  maintain  communications  with  the controlling  agency;  perform  personnel  accounting,  force  management  and  casualty reporting; provide command and control communication and reporting systems; manage a limited number of stage aircraft and/or aircrews (4 crews or less, unless augmented by a qualified  aircrew  stage  manager).    The  designated  CRF  commander  normally  provides leadership for all collocated mobility forces. 2.6.8.2.  The  Senior  Airfield  Authority  (SAA)  is  defined  as  an  individual  appointed  by the  component  responsible  for  airfield  operations  at  the  direction  of  the  Joint  Force Commander  (JFC).    The  CRG  commander  will,  on  order,  assume  initial  SAA.  (T-2)  IAW JP 3-17, Air Mobility Operations, the SAA is responsible for the control, operation, and  maintenance  of  an  airfield  to  include  runways,  associated  taxiways,  parking  ramps, land,  and  facilities  whose  proximity  affect  airfield  operations.    In  situations  where  the SAA  is  not  the  overarching  authority  for  airfield  operations  (e.g.,  host  nation  maintains airfield  authority,  operations  on  civil  airfield),  the  SAA  maintains  responsibility  for  all US military and/or coalition force airfield operations, but will coordinate in advance with the respective airfield officials. 2.6.8.3.  C2  Support.    Responsible  for  all  actions  related  to  information  collection  and dissemination  regarding  base  response  coordination  and  HHQ  notification,  mission management, and operational reports (OPREP). 2.6.8.4.  Communications.  Provides organic initial line of sight and beyond line of sight communications. Provides limited secure/non-secure data, fax and voice communications to support CRF operations. 2.6.9.  Initial FP. 2.6.9.1.  SF.  Will provide initial FP and physical security for USAF resources supporting CRF operations and 24-hour security for  an aircraft parking  area. (T-2)  CR SFs will be manned, trained and equipped to defeat Level I threats and disrupt and/or delay Level II threats  IAW AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense  (FOUO). (T-2)  Will  provide armed close defense  of  USAF  assets  by  flight-line  detection  and  response  teams  and  facilitate seamless reception of follow-on SF. (T-2) Will establish link between CRF, host nation, coalition forces and sister services and coordinate for the patrol of the Base Security Zone (BSZ)  by  these  forces  to  protect  aircraft  transiting  the  airbase.  (T-2)    Aircraft  on  the ground retain the Protection Level (PL) assigned IAW AFI 31-101.  Planners will utilize   18  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 AFI 36-2646, Security Forces Training and Standardization Evaluation Programs, when identifying SF requirements. (T-2) 2.6.9.2.  Intelligence.    Will  conduct  and  continuously  update  Intelligence  Preparation  of the  Operational  Environment  (IPOE),  focusing  on  potential  impact  to  both  ground  and aviation assets and CRF operations area. (T-2)  Will consider terrorist, criminal, medical, military and foreign intelligence threats. (T-2)  Will provide mission planning and debrief support for all CRF operations or activities both inside and outside the airbase perimeter. (T-2)    Will  provide  geospatial  information  and  services  (GI&S)  support  for  the  CRF.  Will  establish  procedures  for  gathering  information  collected  by  aviation  and  ground forces  and reporting to  CRF commander  and controlling agency;  procedures for timely, clear  dissemination  of  intelligence  to  all  co-located  friendly  forces  and  transiting aircrews;  and  indications  and  warning  matrix  for  the  local  area,  as  necessitated  by  the threat.  (T-2)    Will  coordinate  with  SF  and  AFOSI  to  form  a  TWG  (TWG  may  include medical,  CE  and operations personnel, if needed). (T-2)   The CR TWG  will coordinate with the controlling MAJCOM TWG. (T-2) 2.6.9.3.  AFOSI.    The  affiliated  AFOSI  team  will  provide  effective  and  timely counterintelligence  and  special  investigations  (CI/SpI),  conduct  protective  services operations (PSO), participate in the TWG and provide counterintelligence gathered from sources in and around the deployed location. (T-2) 2.6.10.  Initial Air Mobility Support Operations. 2.6.10.1.  Air Transportation.  Will establish aerial port capability of up to and including a working MOG of 2 aircraft/24-hour operations. (T-2)  Will handle cargo and passengers in  minimum  lighting  conditions.  (T-2)    Will  provide  ITV.  (T-2)    Will  establish  and manage  Deployable  Radio  Frequency  Identification  (DRFID)  system  and  Deployable Global  Air  Transportation  Execution  System  (DGATES)  computer  system  to  supply transportation  data  to  the  Integrated  Data  Environment  Global  Transportation  Network Convergence  System  (IGC).

(T-2)    They  will  serve  as  the  primary  legal  advisor  to  the  CRF commander on all legal matters. (T-2) interrogation  operations,  administrative law  and law, 2.6.14.  Augmenting  CRFs.  Augmenting  capabilities  are  those  personnel  or  equipment  not normally  assigned  or  attached  to  a  CRF,  but  are  required  to  support  a  CRF  in  special circumstances.  The necessity for these additive forces may be identified early on by the air component  or  recognized  later  in  the  planning  process,  which  may  affect  the  deployment synchronization  with  the  respective  CRF.    Despite  the  possible  timing  inconsistency,  the tasked  CRF  is  responsible  for  requesting  additional  functional  support  through  MAJCOM tasking  authority  and  incorporating  these  forces  within  the  CRF  organizational  construct when deployed.   Examples include ARFF, fuel services and force protection assets. 2.7.  Commander and Team Chief Responsibilities and Authority. 2.7.1.  CRFs are led by a commander or team chief depending upon the mission requirements and  team  size.    The  airbase  opening  mission  is  led  by  an  (O-6)  CRG  commander,  while GAMSS missions are led by  a CRE commander or a CRT  chief.   The  commander or team chief is the final mission authority and makes decisions not specifically assigned to a higher level  authority.    The  commander  or  team  chief  is  the  primary  liaison  with  host  nation, coalition  or  other  US  forces,  and  the  supported  commander  and/or  controlling  agency.  Unless  otherwise  indicated,  the  commander  or  team  chief  may  delegate  specific  duties  to other team members as necessary.   22  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 2.7.1.1.  The  CRG/CRE commander  or  CRT  chief  will  ensure  the  following  actions  are accomplished during pre-deployment: (T-2) 2.7.1.1.1.  Determining  deployed  organizational  structure  and  succession  of command. 2.7.1.1.2.  Ensuring all personnel are qualified to perform assigned tasks. 2.7.1.1.3.  Ensuring  all  personnel  are  deployment  eligible  IAW  AFI  10-401,  Air Force  Operations  Planning  and  Execution,  AFI  10-403,  Deployment  Planning  and Execution and AFI 36-3802, Personnel Readiness Operations. 2.7.1.1.4.  Ensuring  all  personnel  deploying  with  weapons  are  briefed  prior  to departure  on  the  Law  of  Armed  Conflict  (LOAC),  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of Staff  (CJCS)  Standing  Rules  of  Engagement  (SROE),  theater-specific  ROE,  SOFA and AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force, if applicable. 2.7.1.1.5.  Finalizing  make-up  of  the  deploying  CRF  and  ensuring  personnel  and equipment required to accomplish the mission are tasked. 2.7.1.1.6.  Ensuring  that  pre-departure  mission  planning  is  accomplished  IAW  this AFI. 2.7.1.1.6.1.  Accomplish  deployment  load  plans  to  include  unit  line  numbers (ULN)  represented,  accompanied  by  associated  Hazardous  Materials  Diplomatic Clearance  Request  (HAZDIP)  and  transmit  to  appropriate  sourcing/tasking agency. 2.7.1.1.6.2.  Ensuring FP plan is completed. 2.7.1.1.6.3.  Coordinating logistical support for mission execution. 2.7.1.1.6.4.  Ensuring medical assessment plan is completed. 2.7.1.1.6.5.  Completing  severe  weather  response  planning  to  include  warning thresholds, lead times, issue responsibilities, dissemination methods and response actions. 2.7.1.1.6.6.  Ensuring visual information documentation plan is completed. 2.7.1.1.7.  Ensuring  all  deploying  personnel  are  briefed  prior  to  departure  on  the mission  objective,  operating  environment  and  individual  preparation  required  for deployment. 2.7.1.2.  The  commander  or  team  chief  will  accomplish  the  following  throughout  all phases of CRF operations: (T-2) 2.7.1.2.1.  Safety  of  personnel,  aircraft  and  equipment.  If  safety  procedures  are  not established  initially,  operations  could  be  jeopardized.    The  commander  will  ensure adequate  safety  practices  and  procedures  are  in  place  to  support  the  mission  (e.g. parking  and  taxi  plans  and  procedures,  development  of  a  wildlife  program  IAW guidance  found  in  Air  Force  Pamphlet  (AFPAM)  91-212,  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Management  Techniques,  adequacy  of  FOD  prevention procedures for  airflow and operating environment,  etc).  Of particular importance is explosive  safety  to  ensure  proper  quantity-distance  separation  of  explosives  from AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   23  inhabited building, public areas, and other areas of the airfield and to ensure hot cargo parking  areas  are  properly  designated,  evaluated  and  segregated.    When  assigned, qualified  safety  professionals  designated  as  advisors  work  closely  with  the commander  and  subordinate  commanders  or  team  chiefs  to  ensure  relevant  safety issues are considered and addressed as part of the commanders’ operational decision making  and  plans  process  and  provide  commanders  or  team  chiefs  with  operations support,  including  program  development  of  Flight,  Ground  and  Weapon  safety standard  practices  identified  in  AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air  Force  Mishap  Prevention Program, as applicable. 2.7.1.2.2.  Ensuring  continuous  security  of  resources  from  home  station  departure until return. 2.7.1.2.3.

Performing SAA duties when directed (normally CRG commander). 2.7.1.2.8.  Commanding  USAF  follow-on  or  sustainment  forces  until  the  transfer  of authority to the designated commander (normally CRG commander). 2.7.1.2.9.  Ensuring a seamless transition from seizure forces (when present) to CRG forces  and  from  CRG  forces  to  follow-on  sustainment  forces  (normally  CRG commander). 2.7.1.2.10.  Initiating  and  guiding  airbase  opening  operations  IAW  the  CCDR’s direction (normally CRG commander). 2.7.1.2.11.  Requesting  augmentation  from  other  functional  areas  as  the  mission dictates  (e.g.,  CCT,  SF,  medical,  contracting,  finance,  CE  Emergency  Management, EOD, aircrew flight equipment, public health). 2.7.1.2.12.  Facilitating RFF process initiation by the supported command for follow-on or replacement forces if required. 2.7.1.3.  Additional  CRG  commander  responsibilities  during  airfield  assessment,  CRG main body arrival, CRG execution, CRG transition and CRG redeployment are listed in Chapter 4. 2.7.2.  Contingency  Airbase  Support.    Contingency  support  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to, construction;  sustainment  and  servicing  of  CRF  facilities  and  infrastructure  (work  areas, living  areas,  shower  and  latrine  facilities,  power  and  water  sources,  armory  and environmental  control);  and  maintaining  adequate  supply  of  expendable  resources  (food, drinking water, ammunition).   The individual designated to provide contingency support will coordinate  and  supervise  airbase  development  IAW  CRF  commander  direction.    Designee will be qualified in his or her primary AFSC and UTC responsibilities. (T-3)   24  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 2.8.  Deployed  Command  and  Working  Relationships.  When  CRFs  arrive  at  their  deployed operating location, the commander or team chief must establish positive working and logistical relationships  with  in-place  forces,  host-base  organizations  and  airlift  users.    To  every  extent practical,  relationships  with  the  supporting  unit  or  host  base  regarding  availability  of  existing resources should be negotiated and formalized through a memorandum of agreement.  Normally, BOS  will be provided by  the host base or supporting  components.  CRFs will provide mission information, OPREPs and SITREPs to the controlling agency.  CRF integrity must be maintained to the maximum extent possible for redeployment or forward deployment mission requirements. (T-2)  The following protocol applies to command relationships at deployed locations: 2.8.1.  CRFs  normally  fall  under  tasking  authority  OPCON  when  departing  home-station unless directed otherwise in a SecDef order. 2.8.2.  At CRF-only locations, the CRF commander or team chief has responsibility for all air mobility operations and support personnel and equipment.  Personnel from other units tasked to support CRFs are normally temporarily attached and are under the control and authority of the commander or team chief. (T-2) 2.8.3.  CRFs  and  Special  Tactics  Team  (STT).    The  CRG  commander,  if  designated  as  the SAA at the deployed location, is responsible for the control, operation and maintenance of an airfield,  to  include  runways,  associated  taxiways,  parking  ramps,  land  and  facilities  whose proximity affects airfield operations.  This responsibility includes directing STT activities to coordinate airfield operations when these forces are attached as an element providing direct support  to  the  CRF.    However,  OPCON  and  tactical  control  of  the  STT  normally  remains with AFSOC and/or the Joint Special Operations Air Component while attached to the CRF. (T-2) 2.8.4.  Air expeditionary wing (AEW) or air expeditionary group (AEG) and CRF locations.  Often  CRFs  are  deployed  to  an  operating  location  where  other  deployed  C2  units  are operating or where they will be replaced by follow on forces.  Normally, an AEW or AEG is the tasked organization to provide deployed USAF core functions.  At these locations, CRFs normally retain their deployed unit structure, designation and commander and do not undergo a Change of Operational Control (CHOP).  Unless otherwise specified in a SecDef order or through a CCDR agreement, the CRF commander is normally responsible for all collocated air mobility units if the CRF commander is the senior ranking officer. 2.8.5.  CRFs  and  Theater  bases.    When  a  CRF  deploys  in  support  of  contingency  or  surge operations to an airfield hosted by a Theater-assigned USAF unit commander, the host unit may  provide  much  of  the  ECS  required  for  base  tenant  units,  to  include  messing,  tents, sanitation facilities and showers.  While CRFs may not fall under the host base commander for  administrative  or  operational  authority,  CRFs  should  assist  in  establishing  and maintaining  the  airfield  or  base  camp,  when  possible,  with  manpower  and  equipment  not essential  to  the  air  mobility  mission.    Safety  and  availability  of  essential  equipment  dictate that the duty duration for personnel is reasonable and equipment is not abused or used in any manner that could impact the primary mission. 2.9.  Selection  and  Qualification  of  CRF  Personnel.  Active  duty  component  personnel selected for Permanent Change of Station (PCS) or Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) to a CRF unit should have a minimum of three years of retainability (two years for OCONUS CRGs) to  accommodate  the  multitude  of  additional  training  requirements.    Members  will  fill AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   25  deployment  UTCs  based  upon  AFSC,  training,  qualification  and/or  certification  regardless  of home station duty title or position.  Enlisted personnel will be coded for either a 36- or 48-month tour, IAW AFI 36-2110, Assignments, per MAJCOM direction. 2.9.1.  The  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC)  will  not  assign  personnel  who  are  not worldwide deployable to CRF units.  CRF unit leadership will review inbound assignments data  to  verify  personnel  meet  the  AFSC  and  deployability  requirements.    When  CRF  unit leadership identifies personnel on assignment who do not meet minimum requirements, this information will be elevated through the chain of command to AFPC. 2.9.1.1.  Security  Clearance  Requirements.    All  CRF  personnel  will  have  a  secret clearance at a minimum.  Certain AFSCs may require a Top Secret/Special Background Investigation  (TS/SBI)  clearance.    Personnel  Security  Investigations  (PSI)  will  be  IAW AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, and if required, will be initiated or completed prior to assignment if possible. (T-2) 2.9.1.2.  Airmen  being  considered  for  assignment  to  a  CRF  position  should  possess  the AFSC,  grade  and  skill-level  and  special  experience  identifier  (SEI)  assigned  to  that position. 2.9.1.3.  Personnel  with  a  physical  profile  that  would  prevent  or  exempt  them  from worldwide  mobility  requirements  will  not  be  assigned  to  a  deployable  position.  Personnel who cannot deploy and perform required tasks due to permanent or long-term physical limitations or restrictions will be considered for reassignment or separation. (T-2)   26  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 Chapter 3 MISSION PREPARATION 3.1.  Readiness. 3.1.1.  Before  an  Airman  can  be  assigned  to  a  deployable  position,  the  Airman  must  meet deployment eligibility requirements IAW with this instruction, AFI 10-401, AFI 10-403, AFI 36-2110,  and  the  Supported  Command  processing  guidance  and  reporting  instructions.   Refer  to  mission  directives,  tasking  orders  or  MAJCOM  guidance  for  additional requirements. 3.1.2.  Personnel Readiness.  CRF personnel must maintain the highest state of readiness to include worldwide mobility, medical, Total Force Awareness Training, AFSC and functional area proficiency.  CRF personnel who cannot meet worldwide mobility requirements are on medical P3 or P4 profiles greater than 6 months will be reassigned to non-mobility positions. (T-2) 3.1.2.1.  Passports  and  International  Driving  Permits.    To  facilitate  rapid  deployment, personnel,  including  those  assigned  to  affiliate  UTCs  that  routinely  provide  support  to CRF,  are  required  to  have  both  official  and  civilian  passports  purchased  at  government (unit) expense.  Should an international driving permit be required, it will be purchased at government (unit) expense. (T-3) 3.1.2.1.1.  CRF  units  should  develop  agreements  with  affiliated  units  to  define funding sources for supporting CRF requirements. 3.1.2.2.  Shot  Record.    Immunizations  must  be  current  for  at  least  45  days  past  the deployment start date or for the expected length of the deployment, whichever is longer.  Documentation will be carried on all missions. (T-2) 3.1.3.  Equipment Readiness. CRF-assigned equipment must all be maintained at the highest state of readiness.  Comprehensive equipment control encompassing accountability and rapid access to all authorized equipment must be guaranteed.  CRF equipment which cannot meet worldwide  mobility  requirements  must  be  reported  and  replaced  as  soon  as  funding  and priorities permit.  To facilitate rapid access, CR equipment should be maintained organically to the maximum extent possible. (T-2) 3.1.4.  Teams will have immediate access to the publications specified in this instruction. See Attachment 1.1-1.3 (T-2) 3.1.5.  Commanders  will  ensure  an  adequate  number  of  team  members  are  qualified  in Declaration of Hazardous/Dangerous Goods preparer, certifier and inspector duties, deployed equipment  custodian  duties,  Communications  Security  (COMSEC)  courier  and  weapons courier duties to accomplish the full range of the unit’s mission. (T-2) 3.2.  Pre-Deployment Procedures. 3.2.1.  Contingency  Planning.    Contingency  mission  planning  is  a  dynamic  process constrained  primarily  by  available  time.    To  maximize  efficiency  and  thoroughness,  the mission  planning  process  should  involve  representatives  from  multiple  functional  areas.  Within  a  short  span  of  time,  unit  planners  must  identify  the  mission  tasking,  analyze  all AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   27  facets  of  the  deployed  location  and  environment,  determine  team  composition,  equipment and  support  necessary,  and  then  prepare  the  required  team  and  equipment  for  deployment.  Mission  support  requests  must  be  processed  as  soon  as  possible  to  allow  thorough coordination  and  planning.    Air  Mobility  Command  Pamphlet  (AMCPAM)  10-405,  AMC Deployment,  Employment,  and  Redeployment  Guide  for  Base  Operating  Support,  and  AFI 10-403  may  be  referenced  for  additional  planning  guidance.    Also  see  Attachment  2  for recommended planning considerations. (T-2) 3.2.1.1.  The  CRF  commander  or  team  chief  is  responsible  for  ensuring  pre-departure planning  is  complete  and  adequate  to  accomplish  the  mission  while  providing  for  the well-being  of  deployed  personnel.    Units  should  develop  local  mission  planning procedures that clearly define organizational and individual roles and responsibilities and provide systematic guidance to ensure the timeliness and thoroughness of planning.  The minimum pre-departure planning consists of: (T-2) 3.2.1.1.1.  A FP assessment and plan in conjunction with IPOE. 3.2.1.1.2.  A medical assessment and plan as required. 3.2.1.1.3.  A beddown plan. 3.2.2.  Planning Guidance. 3.2.2.1.  Airlift Planning.  IAW AFMAN 24-204_IP, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military  Air  Shipments,  command  planners  will  ensure  CRFs  defined  within  this instruction will deploy and redeploy under Chapter 3 guidelines.  This guidance will be included  in  the  Mission  Detail  section  of  the  Global  Decision  Support  System,  if required.  See AFMAN 24-204 for waiver authority.  Units must ensure that they develop load plans and hazardous diplomatic clearances and submit to Tasking Authority. (T-2) 3.2.2.2.  Entry  Clearances.    Personnel  country  and  theater  clearances  will  be  submitted IAW  the  Foreign  Clearance  Guide  (FCG).    Theater  commanders  may  levy  notification requirements upon a military team entering a country in their AOR. (T-2) 3.2.2.3.  Intelligence  Considerations.    The  primary  focus  of  CRF  Intelligence  is  to provide support for CRF operations on the ground.  A secondary role is to provide limited support  for  aircrew.    Intelligence  personnel  will  be  integrated  into  the  contingency planning process and are responsible for providing Geospatial Information and Services (GI&S) support, threat data for the airfield, AOR and IPOE. (T-2) 3.2.2.4.  ATC Considerations.  Sourcing of non-organic CRF ATC services for the Open the  Airbase  FM  should  be  requested  by  the  supported  CCDR  or  CDRUSTRANSCOM.  AFSOC  or  the  Theater  Special  Operations  Component  is  the  designated  force  provider for  ATC  support  to  FM  1  when  the  CRF  does  not  have  assigned  ATC  capability.  Planners should also simultaneously coordinate for long term sustainment ATC capability if the mission is planned for longer than 60 days. 3.2.2.5.  AT Considerations.  ATs will gather airfield suitability information by whatever means  available  (e.g.,  previously  conducted  site  surveys,  satellite  imagery,  previous operations, Base Support and Expeditionary (BAS&E) Planning Tool, GeoReach, Global Decision  Support  System  (GDSS)  Giant  Report/Airfield  Detail,  HQ  AMC  Airfield Suitability  and  Restrictions  Report  (ASRR),  airfield  surveys,  LZ  surveys,  after  action   28  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 reports  (AAR)).    Information  that  cannot  be  verified  by  the  team  will  be  annotated  as such. (T-2) 3.2.2.6.  FP  Considerations.    Ensure  planners  utilize  AFI  36-2646  when  identifying  SF-specific  requirements.    For  the  greater  FP  requirements,  planners  must  consult  the OPORD  or  instruction  of  the  combatant  command  into  which  they  are  deploying.    The commander  or  team  chief  is  responsible  for  ensuring  security  of  resources  under  CRF control at deployed locations.  The commander or team chief shall utilize the full TWG, to include local, host nation, sister service and coalition counterparts, if appropriate.  The TWG will keep the commander or team  chief abreast of FP requirements and concerns.  The commander or team chief shall further incorporate SF, Intelligence, AFOSI, CE and medical personnel under their command into an FP cell for their deployed location.  This deployed  cell  will  keep  the  commander  or  team  chief  abreast  of  FP  requirements  and concerns.    When  operating  in  an  uncertain  threat  environment  the  CRF  may  need additional  SF  augmentation.    In  a  hostile  threat  environment  the  CRF  will  require additional SF augmentation. (T-2) 3.2.2.7.  CBRNE  Defense  Considerations.    CRF  CBRNE  defense  capabilities  are  very limited. Defense requirements will be determined by CBRNE threat conditions and host base or augmenting capabilities. (T-2) 3.2.2.8.  Support  from  Outside  Agencies.    The  CRF  may  find  itself  dependent  upon  the host  nation  and/or  coalition  forces  for  any  number  of  services  from  fuel  to  messing facilities. 3.2.2.9.  Weapons.    CRFs  normally  deploy  with  weapons.  Qualified  weapons  couriers will be appointed in writing for deploying forces.  All personnel deploying with weapons will  be  briefed  prior  to  departure  on  the  LOAC,  CJCS  Standing  Rules  of  Engagement (ROE), Theater specific ROE, SOFA and AFI 31-117, if applicable. (T-2) 3.2.2.10.  Communications.  Develop a communications plan IAW mission requirements. Submit  a  Communications  and  Computer  System  Implementation  Directive  (C2SID) Request  and  Satellite  Access  Request/Gateway  Access  Request  (SAR/GAR)  through assigned  higher  headquarters  frequency  manager  IAW  Theater  and  parent  MAJCOM guidance. (T-2) 3.2.2.11.  Uniform.    The  appropriate  uniform  for  the  deployed  location  should  be determined  IAW  AFI  36-2903,  Dress  and  Appearance,  and  the  CCDR’s  policy.  Performance  of  duty  in  civilian  clothes  is  normally  specified  in  the  tasking  order  or message  and  should  normally  be  in  an  appropriate  military  uniform.    However,  the commander  or  team  chief  may  authorize  the  wear  of  civilian  clothing  in  exceptional circumstances.  Authorization may be given by competent authority at the MAJCOM or Combatant  Command  levels  and  by  the  designated  authorities  in  AFI  36-3004,  to perform  duties  in  civilian  clothes  based  on  emerging  security  requirements,  host  nation sensitivities  or  requests,  or  other  conditions  that  might  cause  diplomatic  incidents  or adverse publicity. (T-2) 3.2.2.12.  Weather  Considerations.    Utilize  assigned  weather  function  during  mission planning to assess environmental impacts to the potential operations area.  For operations AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   29  requiring  continuous  CRF  surface  weather  observations,  consider  tasking  additional weather personnel to ensure uninterrupted weather services. (T-2) 3.2.2.13.  Mission  Documentation.    When  necessary,  Combat  Camera  (COMCAM) forces should be requested to provide ground and aerial documentation support. 3.2.3.  Team  Qualification.    Primary  team  members,  or  those  occupying  a  primary  position during an operation (see paragraph 5.4.1.), must be qualified, or in training for qualification, in that position.  If non-current, or in training for a particular event, the team member must be under  the  supervision  of  an  instructor  or  trainer  while  accomplishing  duties.    All  other unqualified or uncertified team members will be under the direct supervision of a trainer or certifier in that team position. (T-2) 3.2.3.1.  Affiliated  Forces.    Affiliated  personnel  must  be  current  and  qualified  in  their primary  AFSC  and  meet  mobility  deployment  requirements.    Regular  training  will  be conducted  with  their  respective  CRFs  to  the  extent  practical  to  ensure  mission  and  unit familiarity. (T-2) 3.2.3.2.  Augmenting Forces.  Augmentees must be current and qualified in their primary AFSC  or  occupational  series  and  meet  the  mobility  requirements  specified  in  this instruction. (T-2) 3.2.3.3.  Medical  Clearance.    All  CRF,  CRF-affiliated  and  CRF-augmenting  forces should  be  medically  cleared  to  perform  duties  for  at  least  45  days  past  the  deployment start  date  or  for  the  expected  length  of  the  deployment,  whichever  is  longer.    Medical clearance will be performed by the host base or unit assigned medical forces. (T-2) 3.2.4.  Equipment  Preparation  and  Accountability.    Equipment  monitors  will  prepare equipment-shipping documentation IAW Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9R Part III, Mobility and AFMAN 24-204(I).  Each UTC-owning team is responsible for its own HAZDEC and other documentation.  Deployed equipment custodians will be appointed prior to  deployment  to  ensure  positive  control  of  equipment.    Certified  individuals  must  be available to prepare and document equipment for redeployment. (T-2) 3.2.5.  Planning  Conferences.    Planning  conference  attendees  should  have  appropriate knowledge and authority to effectively plan the mission and represent the assigned or gained C-NAF commander’s intent.  Ideally the unit representative at a planning conference should actually  deploy  on  the  mission  to  ensure  continuity  throughout  the  planning  and  execution process.   Planners will examine each mission or exercise to maximize training opportunities.  At a minimum, planning conference representatives should gather the following information: (T-2) 3.2.5.1.  Description  of  mission,  units  and  equipment  to  be  deployed,  overall  supported commander’s intent, objectives or exercise scenario. 3.2.5.2.  Locations and dates. 3.2.5.3.  Airflow estimates, expected MOG and operating hours (if available). 3.2.5.4.  Negotiated CRF support requirements and responsibilities. 3.2.5.5.  Specific  funding  and/or  reporting  instructions  (e.g.,  special  statements  required on orders, uniform and/or clothing requirements).   30  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 3.2.5.6.  Planning conference contact list. 3.2.5.7.  Location  information.  Deployed  host  installation  contact  list,  airfield  maps  and diagrams  to  include  parking  areas,  working  areas  and  airfield  survey  information  as required. 3.2.5.8.  C2 relationships and responsibilities. 3.2.5.9.  Threat assessment and force protection requirements. 3.2.5.10.  Base Operating Support requirements. 3.2.6.  ARC  CRF  Funding.    Military  Personnel  Appropriations  (MPA)  and  per  diem  for deployed  operations  will  be  funded  by  the  gained  MAJCOM  or  agency.    MAJCOMs  will specify  procedures  for  processing  MPA  requests.    Supported  units  will  provide  funding  for personnel participating in primary positions and other mission-related activities such as pre-mission  planning,  airfield  survey,  planning,  completion  of  post  mission  reports  and reconstitution.  ARC personnel deployed in training status must be ARC unit funded for pay, travel and per diem. ARC units will pre-coordinate deployment funding with their assigned headquarters prior to volunteering for any deployment tasking. (T-2) 3.2.7.  Preparation  for  Deployment.    Upon  notification  of  deployment,  CRFs  will  be  ready for aircraft loading IAW paragraph 1.9.  Units will maintain a 24-hours a day/7-days a week availability  to  receive  taskings  or  directives  from  the  appropriate  command  authority  (a wing-level 24-hour operations center may be used to satisfy this requirement). (T-2) 3.2.8.  The  tasking  authority  and  unit  commanders  will  ensure  pre-departure  planning  is completed  and  adequate  to  accomplish  the  mission  while  providing  for  the  well-being  of deployed  personnel.    Each  deploying  commander  or  team  chief  will  assemble  and  brief  all deploying  personnel  prior  to  departure  on  mission  objective,  operating  environment  and individual preparation required for deployment.  Those who cannot be personally briefed will be informed sufficiently  prior to  departure to  accomplish  any items  needed for preparation.  Planning  will  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  operating  environment,  mission  requirements and CRF support requirements as follows: (T-2) 3.2.8.1.  Operating environment. 3.2.8.1.1.

This  chapter  provides  basic  guidance  to  execute  CRF  operations  and  specific guidance  for  CRGs  executing  the  Open  the  Airbase  FM  1.    Open  the  base  operations  can  be divided  into  six  phases:  AT  Actions,  CRG  Main  Body  Arrival  Actions,  Mission  Execution, Transitions,  Forward/Re-deployment  and  Reconstitution.  Reference  AFTTP  3-1.1,  General Planning  and  Employment  Considerations,  in  conjunction  with  this  chapter  when  executing deployed operations. 4.2.  Reports for CRF Operations.  At a minimum, all reports will be handled as “For Official Use Only” (FOUO) IAW guidance provided in IAW AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC), MAJCOM  and  local  directives  as  appropriate  (including  MAJCOM,  base  and  unit  Critical Information Lists) in order to protect sensitive and critical information. (T-3) 4.2.1.  On-Station  Report.  CRFs  will  submit  an  initial  verbal  on-station  report  to  the controlling  agency  within  30  minutes  of  arrival  (60  minutes  for  airborne  insertion).    Send written  on-station  report  when  time  permits.    Submit  a  revised  on-station  report  as  soon  as CRFs  are  prepared  to  begin  operations.    This  report  is  critical  to  ensure  the  controlling agency  can  begin  directing  global  mobility  missions  into  the  deployed  location.    Identify limiting factors to mission execution.  See Attachment A3.1 for example report format and refer  to  AFI  10-206,  Operational  Reporting,  for  most  current  instructions  and  format requirements. (T-3) 4.2.2.  Situation  reports  (SITREPs).    Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the  controlling  agency, SITREPs will be sent by CRFs NLT than 0800Z daily and reflect current data as of 0600Z. OPORDs, Special Instructions (SPINS) or CONOPs may direct different reporting times and formats  for  the  daily  SITREP.    These  formats  and  times  will  be  adhered  to  only  with concurrence of the controlling agency.  The SITREP will include limiting factors to mission execution,  location  workload,  threat  environment,  airfield  capability,  equipment  status  and personnel  availability.  It  will  also  contain  any  medical,  legal  or  diplomatic  problems  or changes in the host base/force and deployed force working relationship.  See Attachment 3.2. for  example  format  and  refer  to  AFI  10-206  for  most  current  instructions  and  format requirements.  Reports will be sequentially numbered starting with 001. (T-3) 4.2.3.  Send  a  Deployed  Personnel  &  Equipment  (DP&E)  report  to  the  controlling  agency and info copy to the AFFOR/A1 within 24 hours of arrival at the deployed location.  Update this  report  when  manpower  and  equipment  changes  occur  or  when  requested  by  the controlling  agency.    Sequentially  number  the  reports.  See  Attachment  3.3.  for  example format and AFI 10-206 for most current instructions and format requirements. (T-3) 4.2.4.  Submit  OPREPs  IAW  theater  and  MAJCOM  directives,  SPINS  and  AFI  10-206. Submit  initial  Pinnacle  Nucflash  reports  within  5  minutes  of  event  or  incident  or  when known and submit initial Pinnacle/Beeline reports within 15 minutes of event or incident or when known.  If initial report is verbal, submit a hard copy within 1 hour of event or incident or when known. Send complete reports as soon as possible. (T-2) 4.2.5.  Provide AARs to the controlling agency IAW MAJCOM guidance.  The AAR should contain a summary of the contingency, exercise or operational mission supported and a brief AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   33  description  of  the  concept  of  operations,  CRF  roles  and  responsibilities,  airlift  volume  and reliability  statistics,  problem  areas  and  lessons  learned.  In  each  area  where  problems  are encountered,  the  problem  should  be  described,  together  with  causes,  impact,  and solutions/recommended  solutions.  Specific  facts  and  information  are  needed  to  help  solve problems  and  prevent  future  forces  from  repeating  the  same  mistakes.    Units  will  (when applicable)  enter  AARs  into  the  Joint  Lesson  Learned  Information  System  (JLLIS). MAJCOMs will direct specific formats required for JLLIS.  See Attachment A3.5 for AAR example. (T-3) 4.3.  CRGs  Executing  the  Open  the  Airbase  Force  Module  (FM1)  and  other  CRF Operations.  The  following  paragraphs  describe  actions  normally  required  to  accomplish  CRG FM1 operations; depending upon the existing or planned support infrastructure at the operating location, some of the following actions are also required to accomplish other CRF (i.e., CRE and CRT)  operations.    Not  all  CRFs  are  assigned  all  of  the  following  capabilities  and  may  require augmentation. 4.3.1.  AT  Actions.    ATs  are  the  lead  element  for  the  CRG  and  are  required  to  conduct  an initial  airfield  assessment  within  24  hours  of  arrival  at  the  deployed  airfield.    Assessments will  address  runways,  ramps,  FP,  communications,  facilities,  ARFF,  base  support  and beddown as a minimum and will provide a recommendation on the suitability of further flight operations in support of (ISO) the planned operation. (CRG only) The AT or CRF ADVON will: (T-2) 4.3.1.1.  Prior  to  arrival,  if  able,  establish  contact  with  the  Director,  Mobility  Forces (DIRMOBFOR)  (if  assigned),  theater  planners,  seizure  force,  non-governmental agencies, host base and/or host nation personnel to obtain updates. 4.3.1.2.  Upon  arrival  make  contact  with  seizure  force,  US  Agency  for  International Development,  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency,  non-governmental  agencies, host  base  or  host  nation  personnel,  identify  responsibilities,  coordinate  for  potential operating and beddown locations for CRF and any follow-on forces. 4.3.1.3.

JA will provide legal advice as required on all matters listed in paragraph 2.6.13.11. (T-3) 4.3.4.  Transitions.  As CRFs are normally intended to deploy for no longer than 60 days, the CRF  commander  or  team  chief  should  initiate  transition  planning  as  soon  as  practical  after arrival at the deployed location.  The supported CCDR must immediately begin sourcing the appropriate  follow-on  force.    CRFs  must  be  ready  to  move  from  the  deployed  location  to either  another  forward  location,  an  intermediate  staging  base  (ISB)  or  to  home  station  to reconstitute  the  base-opening  capability  as  quickly  as  possible.    As  the  Open  the  Airbase phase  draws  down,  the  CRG  commander  must  look  at  the  deployed  forces  and  determine which  functional  areas  can  be  reduced  or  eliminated.    Functions  such  as  maintenance, materiel management and aerial port are directly related to airflow requirements and should only  be  decreased  in  proportion  to  a  sustained  reduction  in  airflow.    To  expedite  the transition  process,  synchronization  and  hand-off  with  follow-on  forces  must  begin immediately.    CRF  commanders  will  brief  incoming  follow-on  or  sustainment  forces commanders  on  assumption  of  the  responsibilities  currently  assumed  by  the  CRF.    See Attachment 5 for recommended considerations. (T-3) 4.3.5.  Redeployment  and  Forward  Deployment.    CRF  commanders  and  team  chiefs  will ensure orderly phase-out of operational capability and CRF redeployment. (T-3) 4.3.5.1.  Redeployment Plans.  Requirements and proposed load plans for the roll-up and redeployment  of  CRFs  will  be  forwarded  to  the  controlling  agency  as  soon  as  possible after  arrival  at  the  deployed  location.    The  validation  process  in  the  Joint  Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) takes up to 21 days for airlift and 45 days for sealift, which drives the timeline for the redeployment plan.  This plan should be updated as required. Reports will be sequentially numbered starting with 001. (T-3)   44  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 4.3.5.2.  CRFs will closely coordinate with their controlling agency to ensure no lapse in mission coverage during redeployment or forward deployment of forces.  No forces will redeploy  or  forward  deploy  without  the  concurrence  of  the  CRF  commander  or  team chief and the controlling agency. (T-3) 4.3.5.3.  CRF  commanders,  team  chiefs  and/or  their  designated  representatives  should personally  meet  with  key  host  officials  to  resolve  any  final  problems  or  unfinished business.   All  borrowed or joint-use equipment  must be returned in  a clean, serviceable condition  and  operations  areas  must  be  cleaned  and  restored  to  their  original  or  better condition.    All  financial  obligations  of  the  US  government  must  be  paid  or  satisfactory arrangements made to ensure that obligations will be taken care of in an appropriate and timely  manner.    CRFs  must  comply  with  host  nation  diplomatic  and  security requirements during roll-up. (T-3) 4.3.5.4.  The CRF commander or team chief is responsible and accountable for ensuring that  all  equipment  and  personnel  depart  the  deployed  location  with  valid  shipping  or travel  arrangements  to  home  station  or  follow-on  tasking  locations.    If  individuals  are detained  for  legal  or  diplomatic  reasons  or  equipment  seized  or  impounded  by  the  host nation, contact the controlling agency and/or AMD for guidance. (T-3) 4.3.5.4.1.  CRF equipment is not normally transferred to theater or follow-on forces.  Coordination  with  the  controlling  agency,  assigned  MAJCOM/A3  and  unit  chain  of command must be completed before any CRF equipment is left behind or transferred to  theater  or  follow-on  forces.      All  transfer  authorizations  must  be  received  and approved  through  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  FAM(s).    Additionally,  theater  or follow-on forces must be authorized to accept and be fully qualified on the equipment to  be  transferred.    A  complete  inventory  listing  quantity  and  serial  numbers  of equipment  shall  be  completed,  a  signed  receipt  will  be  completed  and  home  station equipment accounts will be updated before a funding transfer takes place per AFI 23-101,  Air  Force  Materiel  Management,  Section  5D  and  AFMAN  23-122,  Materiel Management Procedures, Section 5D. (T-3) 4.3.5.4.2.  IAW  AFI  23-101  and  AFMAN  23-122,  if  OPCON  of  a  CRF  should transfer  to  another  CCDR,  transfer  of  resources  can  occur  120  days  after  the equipment enters the theater if CRFs are CHOPed.  Deployed equipment  custodians or supply personnel should ensure appropriate documentation is completed. 4.3.5.5.  If part or all of the CRFs are tasked to forward deploy, the CRF commander will submit all requests for information (RFI) on the forward deployment tasking through the controlling  agency.    CRF  commanders  will  submit  complete  listings  of  their  equipment and  personnel  status,  estimated  airlift  requirement,  a  Manpower  and  Materiel  (M&M) request  for  the  new  tasking  and  CRF-limiting  factors  to  the  controlling  agency.    CRFs will submit a list  of supplies required to  reconstitute their equipment  to  full operational capacity before forward deploying. (T-3) 4.3.5.6.  The CRF commander or designated representative will ensure a detailed listing of contaminated equipment and vehicles is provided to the controlling agency for review prior  to  developing  the  redeployment  plan.    Regardless  of  the  level  of  decontamination sustained,  residual  contaminates  (undetectable  with  currently  fielded  detectors)  may remain.  Controlling agency authorization to airlift this cargo is required. (T-3) AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   45  4.3.6.  Reconstitution.    CRFs  will  reconstitute  personnel  and  equipment  quickly  to  accept future taskings. (T-3) 4.3.6.1.  Units  will  develop  procedures  to  reconstitute  their  UTC’s  to  full  operational capacity within 72 hours of return to home station. (T-3) 4.3.6.2.  Reconstitution will be accomplished during normal duty hours to the maximum extent practical. (T-3) 4.3.6.3.  U nits will report any UTC capability that cannot be brought to full operational capacity or replaced within the 72 hour timeframe to their assigned MAJCOM FAM. (T-3) 4.3.6.4.  AARs  will  be  completed  and  submitted  IAW  para  4.2.5.  A  copy  of  the  report will be placed in  a consolidated library for mission planning reference.  See attachment A3.5. for example format. (T-3) 4.3.6.5.  Lessons Learned.  Units will manage a lessons learned program which will: (T-3) 4.3.6.5.1.  Analyze exercises, inspections, evaluations, and AARs to determine if any trends  are  developing  that  would  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  readiness  or effectiveness. 4.3.6.5.2.  Identify best practices for accomplishing CRF missions. 4.3.6.5.3.  Track progress of changes implemented to programs in response to trends or lessons learned. 4.3.6.5.4.  Lessons  learned  meetings  will  be  conducted  as  required  with  unit instructors  and  evaluators.    Information  should  also  be  shared  with  the  CRF community.   46  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 Chapter 5 TRAINING 5.1.  General.  This  chapter  prescribes  basic  policy  and  guidance  for  training  to  ensure consistency  in  capability  between  all  CRFs  and  establishes  minimum  specific  training proficiency requirements for CRF personnel.  The overarching objective of the training program is  to  develop  and  maintain  a  high  state  of  mission  readiness  for  immediate  and  effective employment  in  exercises,  contingencies  and  Humanitarian  Assistance/Disaster  Relief  (HA/DR) operations. 5.1.1.  The two major types of training addressed in this instruction are CRF mission training and CFETP training governed by AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training.  CRF mission training is CRF  qualification-specific  training.  CFETP  training  is  non-CRF  specific  AFSC  skills training.

Therefore,  unit  commanders  may  define  which  of  the  following programs are applicable for their forces: (T-3) 6.3.1.  R&C  Program.    The  R&C  program  places  primary  responsibility  for  unit  training, upgrade and certification on the unit commander.  Unit supervisory involvement is critical to ensure the unit commander has all available information to make the best decisions possible for  maintaining  unit  capability.    Frequency  and  composition  of  R&C  boards  will  be determined  by  the  unit  commander.    See  Attachment  4.4.  for  an  example  of  R&C  board minutes. 6.3.1.1.  The review portion of the R&C program provides commander oversight of unit training.    This  portion  of  the  R&C  program  addresses  the  adequacy  of  training  for substandard  performance,  in-unit  upgrades,  qualifications  and  re-qualifications,  as required. AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   65  6.3.1.2.  The  certification  portion  of  the  R&C  program  formally  completes  the  mission certification  process.    This  portion  provides  commander  oversight  through  formal documentation of mission qualification or other specialized training. 6.3.1.2.1.  R&C boards will certify completion of training and evaluations for initial upgrade or requalification IAW Table 6.1. 6.3.1.2.2.  All  personnel  will  be  certified  upon  completion  of  CAT  I  training  as outlined in paragraph 5.5. before being assigned to a deployable UTC. 6.3.1.2.3.

Units  will  maintain  a  Letter  of  X’s,  or  equivalent  database, documenting  global  mobility  certifications  and  special  qualifications  for  unit  personnel.  Information  will  be  updated  and  a  certified  copy  will  be  provided  to  the  appropriate Stan/Eval personnel, on a recurring basis or as updates are required (to be determined by the Chief of the Stan Eval program). 6.3.2.1.  The unit commander’s signature (may be digital) certifies the Letter of X’s. 6.3.2.2.  Units  will  indicate  an  individual’s  certification  or  qualification  by  placing  an “X” in the appropriate column. Instructor or Trainer certification is indicated with an “I,” evaluator certification is indicated by an “E”. 6.3.2.2.1.  All  assigned  personnel  will  be  listed  on  the  database  with  the  applicable qualifications in Table 6.1.  Not all items will apply to all personnel or units. 6.3.2.2.2.  Commanders  may  add  additional  qualifications  to  their  Letter  of  X’s  at their discretion. 6.3.3.  Stan/Eval  Testing.    The  testing  program  will  be  designed  to  assess  members’ knowledge  of  USAF,  MAJCOM  and  commander  SIIs,  pre-mission  planning  duties,  the deployment process and emergency actions as required. 6.3.3.1.  CRE  commanders,  CRE  operations  officers,  CRT  Chiefs  and  CSE  Chiefs  will successfully complete an open book evaluation before being certified in their respective duty position.  Successful completion is defined as a grade of 80% or higher. 6.3.3.2.  Unit commanders may direct other mission-related testing. 6.3.3.3.  Stan/Eval  functions  will  maintain  at  least  two  versions  of  each  test  with questions derived from a master question file (MQF).  MQF sources include AFI 10-401, AFI  31-101,  AFI  31-201,  Security  Forces  Standards  and  Procedures,  AMC  Global Mobility Checklists, AMC Global Mobility QRCs, Master Read File, IDP and the FCG.  Tests and MQF will be reviewed by unit Stan/Eval annually for accuracy and currency.  MAJCOMs  will  provide  unit  MQF  products  to  HQ  AMC/A3CM  upon  request  for community standardization review purposes. 6.3.3.4.  All tests will assess knowledge of current SIIs, deciphering tasking documents, gathering  user  and  mission  requirements,  acquiring  transportation  for  personnel  and equipment,  gathering  information  on  mission  location,  FP  considerations  and  planning, AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   67  acquiring country, theater and special area clearances and resolving problems in mission execution. 6.3.3.5.  CRE commanders and CRT chiefs will be tested on knowledge of CR doctrine, OPREP reporting, QRCs, airfield suitability, theater C2 systems, reporting requirements, aircrew stage management, finance and contracting responsibilities, legal considerations when  resolving  personnel  and  host  nation  issues,  and  sister  service  supporting  and supported organizations and capabilities. 6.3.3.6.  CRE  operations  officers  will  be  tested  on  knowledge  of  CR  doctrine,  OPREP reporting,  QRCs,  airfield  suitability,  theater  C2  systems,  reporting  requirements  and aircrew stage management. 6.4.  Evaluations.  (T-3) 6.4.1.  Administration.    The  evaluation  program  is  designed  to  verify  successful  training completion  and  that  individuals  are  ready  to  conduct  operations  unsupervised.    All evaluations  will  be  conducted  by  personnel  certified  as  evaluators  in  the  CJQS  area  being evaluated.    Evaluations  will  be  recorded  on  a  Letter  of  Evaluation  and  Certification  and certified  by  the  unit  commander  at  the  R&C  board.    See  Attachment  A4.1.  for  format example. 6.4.2.  Evaluation Requirements. 6.4.2.1.  Completion  of  the  following  CJQSs  requires  evaluations  prior  to  unit commander  certification:  CRE  commander,  CRE  operations  officer,  CRT  chief  and ATT/CLPT. 6.4.2.2.  Commanders may direct a requirement for an evaluation before certification for other duty-positions, including instructor or evaluator qualifications. 6.4.2.3.  Certification  of  an  individual  requiring  an  evaluation  without  completion  of  an evaluation is not authorized. 6.4.3.  Types of Evaluations. 6.4.3.1.  Mission  Evaluations.    All  members  will  successfully  complete  a  mission qualification  evaluation  upon  completion  of  any  CJQS  as  outlined  in  paragraph  6.5.  Some mission evaluations require successful completion of an open book examination as defined  in  this  chapter.    Record  this  evaluation  on  a  Letter  of  Evaluation  and Certification. 6.4.3.2.  No-Notice  Evaluations.    Unit  commanders  may  direct  evaluations  at  any  time.  Record this evaluation on a separate Letter of Evaluation and Certification. 6.4.3.3.  Requalification Evaluations (RQ). 6.4.3.3.1.  Individuals previously qualified in CR operations will be requalified IAW Table 5.1. 6.4.3.3.2.  The  unit  commander  will  determine the  member  requires  a requalification  evaluation  after  a  decertification.    If  required,  the  evaluation  will  be recorded on a separate Letter of Evaluation and Certification. if   68  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 6.4.3.3.3.  If the member does not require a requalification evaluation, the commander will  certify  the  member  as  requalified  on  a  separate  Letter  of  Evaluation  and Certification. 6.4.3.4.  Spot  Evaluations.    Unit  commander  may  direct  evaluations  targeting  specific areas  but  not  all  aspects  of  a  mission.    These  evaluations  shall  be  identified  as  Spot Evaluations and recorded on a separate Letter of Evaluation and Certification. 6.4.4.  Evaluation Grading Policies.  When evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area  may  be  verbally  evaluated.  Evaluators  will  make  every  effort  to  evaluate  all  required areas during the evaluation before resorting to this provision.  If an alternate method is used to  complete  the  evaluation,  document  in  the  comments  portion  of  the  Letter  of  Evaluation and Certification. 6.4.5.  Evaluation  Grading  System.    A  two-tiered  grading  system  is  used  to  evaluate  and document  performance  for  CR  duty  position  qualifications  listed  in  para  6.5.    Individual scores  are  recorded  for  examinations  while  areas/sub-areas  of  performance  are  individually graded  against  established  evaluation  criteria.    Performance  less  than  fully  qualified  is documented.  An  overall  qualification  level  is  determined  from  the  compilation  of  these individual scores and/or grades. 6.4.5.1.  Area and Sub-area Grades.  In the absence of criteria from USAF or MAJCOM directives, Stan/Eval functions will establish areas and sub-areas to be evaluated and the appropriate  grading  criteria  for  those  areas  and  sub-areas.    Areas  will  have  a  two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system.  The overall area grade will be the lowest of any sub-area grade awarded. 6.4.5.1.1.  Qualified  (Q).    Q  is  the  desired  level  of  performance.    The  examinee demonstrated a satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed duties within the prescribed tolerances and accomplished the assigned mission. 6.4.5.1.2.  Qualified Minus (Q-). Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the evaluator.  Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize safety. 6.4.5.1.3.  Unqualified  (U).    Assign  a  U  area  grade  for  any  breach  of  discipline, performance  outside  allowable  parameters  or  deviations  from  prescribed  procedures or tolerances that adversely affected mission accomplishment or compromised safety.  An  examinee  receiving  an  area  grade  of  U  normally  requires  additional  training.  When,  in  the  judgment  of  the  evaluator,  additional  training  will  not  constructively improve examinee’s performance, it is  not  required.  In this case, the evaluator must thoroughly  debrief  the  examinee.    This  does  not  apply  to  Critical  Areas  on  the evaluation form. 6.4.5.2.  Critical  Areas.   Critical  areas require  adequate  accomplishment  by the member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives.  Critical areas are graded either Q or U. 6.4.5.2.1.  Critical  areas  are  identified  by  shading  of  the  Q-  block  on  the  evaluation checklist. AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   69  6.4.5.2.2.  At  a  minimum,  safety,  risk  management  (RM)  and  judgment  are considered critical areas for all CRF mission evaluations. 6.4.5.3.  Qualification Levels.  Overall evaluation performance is graded by qualification levels as follows: 6.4.5.3.1.  Qualification  Level  1  (Q1).   The  member  demonstrated  desired performance  and  knowledge  of  procedures,  equipment  and  directives  within tolerances  specified  in  the  grading  criteria.    This  will  be  awarded  when  no discrepancies were noted and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if: 6.4.5.3.1.1.  The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any area(s) or sub-area(s). 6.4.5.3.1.2.  In the judgment of the evaluator, none of the discrepancies preclude awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1. 6.4.5.3.1.3.  All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the debrief. 6.4.5.3.2.  Qualification  Level  2  (Q2).    The  member  demonstrated  the  ability  to perform duties safely, but: 6.4.5.3.2.1.  One or more areas or sub-areas required additional training. 6.4.5.3.2.2.  A non-critical area or sub-area grade of U was awarded. 6.4.5.3.2.3.  In  the  judgment  of  the  evaluator,  there  is  justification  based  on performance in one or several areas or sub-areas. 6.4.5.3.3.  Qualification  Level  3  (Q3).    The  member  demonstrated  an  unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge. 6.4.5.3.3.1.  An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q3 for the evaluation. 6.4.5.3.3.2.  An  overall  Q3  can  be  awarded  if,  in  the  judgment  of  the  evaluator, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas or sub-areas. 6.4.6.  Conduct of Evaluations. 6.4.6.1.  Evaluators will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, requirements of the  evaluation  and  all  applicable  evaluation  criteria.    Evaluators  will  then  evaluate  the examinee  in  each  graded  area  or  sub-area.    For  example,  evaluation  checklists  for CRE/CC, CRE Operations Officer and CRT Chief, see attachments A4.6. – A4.8. 6.4.6.2.  Evaluators should not evaluate personnel they are rated by; for example, a flight commander  should  not  give  his  or  her  squadron  commander  an  evaluation  or  have recommended for evaluation.  Deviations will be approved, in writing, by the examinee’s commander and the Chief of Stan/Eval. 6.4.6.3.  An  evaluation  will  not  be  changed  to  a  training  mission  to  avoid  documenting substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.   70  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 6.4.6.4.  Early termination of an evaluation (an incomplete evaluation) for any reason will be clearly documented on a 623A with a course of action recommended to complete the evaluation. 6.4.6.5.  The judgment of the evaluator and the guidance provided in this instruction will be the determining factors in assigning an overall qualification level.  The evaluator will thoroughly  debrief  the  examinee  and  critique  all  aspects  of  the  evaluation.    During  the critique, the evaluator will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, and any  additional  training  required.    The  evaluator  will  debrief  the  examinee’s  supervisor when any grade below Q1 is awarded or the evaluation is determined to be incomplete. 6.4.6.6.  Reevaluations  will  be  administered  by  an  evaluator  other  than  the  one  who administered the original unsatisfactory evaluation.  Deviations must be approved by the examinee’s commander and the Chief of Stan/Eval. 6.4.7.  Unsatisfactory Performance. 6.4.7.1.  The  evaluator  will  recommend  additional  training  requirements  to  the  unit commander. Required additional training will not be accomplished on the same mission. 6.4.7.2.  The evaluator will immediately correct breaches of safety during an evaluation. 6.4.7.3.  Evaluators  observing  unsatisfactory  performance  by  a  team  member  other  than the examinee will correct the member and provide feedback, if warranted. 6.4.7.4.  Commanders will direct  reevaluation  if, in  the opinion of the evaluator and the commander, the unsatisfactory performance warrants not certifying the individual in the evaluated duty position.  Required items for reevaluation will be determined by the unit commander  after  considering  the  evaluator’s  recommendations.    Reevaluations  may  be completed at home station and will be completed within 60 days of the date of the failed evaluation for active duty component unit personnel and within 90 days of the date of the failed evaluation for ARC unit personnel. 6.4.8.  Incomplete  Evaluation.    Evaluators  will  make  every  effort  to  prevent  an  incomplete evaluation from occurring.  It is possible that circumstances beyond their control may result in  an  incomplete  evaluation.    The  evaluator  will  take  every  action  possible  to  complete  as many items as possible during the evaluation. 6.4.8.1.  The evaluator will evaluate all items accomplished and document on the Letter of  Evaluation  and  Certification  those  items  required  to  complete  the  evaluation.    Any critical  item  graded  unsatisfactory  will  require  a  complete  reevaluation.    A  Letter  of Evaluation  and  Certification  will  be  completed  to  document  the  failed  evaluation  and  a separate Letter of Evaluation and Certification will be completed for the reevaluation. 6.4.8.2.  If possible, the evaluator for the incomplete evaluation should be the same one used  to  complete  the  evaluation.    If  this  is  not  possible,  the  evaluator  completing  the evaluation  will  completely  review  the  incomplete  evaluation  Letter  of  Evaluation  and Certification to ensure all items will be accomplished. 6.4.9.  ATCALS  Evaluations.    Deployable  ATCALS  evaluations  will  be  conducted  by  the unit’s Quality Assurance personnel IAW MPTO 00-33A-1001. AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   71  6.5.  Letter  of  Evaluation  and  Certification  Completion  and  Management.  Use  a  Letter of Evaluation and Certification to record and to certify member qualification as demonstrated in all evaluations.  See Attachment A4.1. for format example. (T-3) 6.5.1.  Identify examinee’s name, grade and organization. 6.5.2.  Identify the duty position for which the evaluation was given. 6.5.3.  Mission descriptions will be annotated and should be of sufficient detail to verify the significant required areas for the evaluation were accomplished.  Mission descriptions should outline  the  details  of  the  evaluation  stating  type,  location,  dates  and  specific  mission  data.  Mission  data  includes  such  information  as  number  of  personnel  on  mission,  number  of aircraft worked, and amount of cargo, passengers and medevacs processed. 6.5.3.1.  If  two  or  more  TDYs  or  events  are  required  to  complete  an  evaluation,  the evaluator completing the evaluation signs the Letter of Evaluation and Certification. 6.5.3.2.  If  more  than  one  evaluator  was  involved  in  administering  the  evaluation, evaluators  other  than  the  one  signing  will  enter  remarks  describing  those  parts  of  the evaluation  they  evaluated  and  sign  a  signature  block  immediately  adjacent  to  their remarks. 6.5.4.  Reviewing  and  Approving  Officers.    Reviewing  officers  ensure  all  requisites  of  the evaluation were met and the evaluation profile, home station and TDY or deployment phases were  adequate  to  justify  the  qualification  level  assigned  by  the  evaluator.    The  approving officer awards the duty position certification to the examinee. 6.5.4.1.  The reviewing officer will be the squadron operations officer, at a minimum. 6.5.4.2.  For  evaluations  where  the  operations  officer  is  being  evaluated,  the  reviewing and approving officer will be the squadron commander. 6.5.4.3.  The approving officer will be the squadron commander or higher. 6.5.4.4.  For  evaluations  where  the  squadron  commander  is  being  evaluated,  the reviewing and approving officer will be the group commander. 6.5.4.5.  For  certifications  where  the  group  commander  is  being  certified,  the  reviewing and approving officer will be the wing commander. 6.5.4.6.  The  reviewing  and  approving  officers  will  ensure  recommended  additional training is adequate to correct the noted deficiencies. 6.5.4.7.  If  a  reviewing  or  approving  officer  does  not  agree  with  the  evaluator's  overall rating,  the  overall  grade  will  not  be  changed.    The  reviewing  or  approving  officer  will mark “Do Not Concur” or “Do Not Certify” as appropriate, and will annotate comments above his or her signature block. 6.5.5.  File  Letters  of  Evaluation  and  Certification  and  Decertification  Letters  in  the member’s training folder. 6.5.5.1.  Decertification Letters are prepared IAW guidelines in Attachment A4.2. 6.6.  CRE  Commander  Evaluation  Profile.  All  CRE/CC  evaluations  will  assess  examinee’s pre-deployment,  employment  (will  be  planned  with  at  least  one  actual  aircraft),  redeployment   72  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 and post deployment actions.  See Attachment A4.6. for CRE Commander Evaluation Checklist.  In  addition,  the  examinee  will  oversee  and  be  able  to  perform  all  of  the  items  on  the  CRE Operations Officer Evaluation Checklist as requested by the evaluator.  This evaluation profile is developed for a basic CRE (aerial port, C2 and aircraft maintenance) so additional items should be added as applicable to ensure the examinee is capable of accomplishing the unit mission (for example,  a  unit  with  the  JTF-PO  mission  should  add  items  to  show  understanding  of  Base Operating  Support,  differing  threat  environments  that  can  drive  complex  Base  Defense  Plans, environmental concerns associated with beddown, etc.). (T-3) 6.7.  CRE Operations Officer Evaluation Profile.  All CRE operations officer evaluations will assess  examinee’s  pre-deployment,  employment  (will  be  planned  with  at  least  one  actual aircraft), redeployment and post deployment actions.  See Attachment A4.7. for CRE Operations Officer Evaluation Checklist.  This evaluation profile is developed for a basic CRE (aerial port, C2  and  aircraft  maintenance)  so  additional  items  should  be  added  as  applicable  to  ensure  the examinee  is  capable  of  accomplishing  the  unit’s  assigned  mission  (e.g.,  understanding  of  Base Operating  Support,  differing  threat  environments  that  can  drive  complex  Base  Defense  Plans, environmental concerns associated with beddown, etc.). (T-3) 6.8.  CRT  Chief  Evaluation  Profile.  All  CRT  chief  evaluations  will  assess  examinee’s  pre-deployment,  employment  (will  be  planned  with  at  least  one  actual  aircraft),  redeployment  and post deployment actions.  See Attachment A4.8. for CRT Chief Evaluation Checklist. (T-3) 6.9.  Other Duty Positions.  Units may develop profiles for duty positions requiring evaluations for certification if no profile is established in USAF or MAJCOM instructions.  Units will submit evaluation profiles to their MAJCOM A3 for approval. (T-3) AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   73  Chapter 7 AIRFIELD SURVEY PROGRAM 7.1.  Purpose.  This chapter defines the Airfield Survey Program, establishes responsibilities and develops  the  procedures  used  to  request,  task,  conduct  and  document  airfield  surveys.    It  also establishes authority to conduct airfield surveys. 7.2.  General.  Airlift,  tanker,  contract  carrier  and  Civil  Reserve  Air  Fleet  (CRAF)  aircraft operate throughout the world at  airfields which must be certified as suitable for specific USAF aircraft  operations.    The  suitability  assessment  of  airfields  is  based  in  part  on  information provided by airfield surveys, when available. CRF assessment and survey teams, in conjunction with functional area experts, are responsible for conducting airfield surveys throughout the world and  will  document  airfield  data  on  the  AMC  FORM  174.    The  Survey  Tool  for  Employment Planning (STEP) may be used to augment AMC FORM 174 requirements.  Survey data will be made available through the airfield suitability program administered by HQ AMC as USAF lead command for mobility operations. (T-2) 7.3.  Responsibilities. 7.3.1.  HQ AMC/A3 is responsible for managing the airfield survey program and determining airfield suitability for all mobility aircraft. 7.3.2.  MAJCOM  A2  Analysis  Division  is  responsible  for  providing  detailed  imagery  with sufficient information to identify dimensions of hard surfaces and potential obstacles, hazards or limiting factors affecting mobility aircraft operations. 7.3.3.  HQ  AMC/A3A  Airfield  Operations  Division  is  the  OPR  for  determining  airfield suitability  for  mobility  aircraft  operations,  updating  and  maintaining  the  AMC  Airfield Database  (AFD)  contained  in  GDSS,  and  is  the  only  authority  for  official  mobility  airfield suitability.  Duties include researching available and applicable resources such as host nation aeronautical  information  publication  (AIP)  data,  pavement  reports,  airfield  surveys,  and flight information publications (FLIP) to determine airfield suitability for aircraft operations; processing  completed  surveys  from  ASTs;  updating  the  AFD;  providing  consultation  to USTRANSCOM  and  other  organizations’  planners  regarding  feedback  and/or  information necessary for a complete airfield suitability assessment; and determining whether a particular airport is suitable for specific mobility aircraft. 7.3.4.  HQ AMC/A3C C2/Expeditionary Operations Division  is  responsible for establishing policy, procedures and standards to conduct airfield surveys and AST training. 7.3.5.  HQ  AMC/A4R  Logistics  Readiness  Division for  managing expeditionary site planning for AMC which supports the wartime deliberate planning process IAW  AFI10-404,  Base  Support  And  Expeditionary  (BAS&E)  Site  Planning.    It  establishes standards and procedures for use in the automated airfield site survey tools, integrating HQ AMC  and  USTRANSCOM  logistics  multi-user  environments  and  arranging  the  storage  of Expeditionary Site Plan (ESP) data. responsible is 7.3.6.  MAJCOM  A7  is  responsible  for  providing  policy,  engineer  recommendations  and guidance pertaining to pavement evaluations consistent with established USAF criteria on the   74  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 capabilities  and  limitations  of  airfield  surfaces,  to  include  structural  capacity,  surface conditions and MOG calculations. 7.3.7.  CRF unit commanders with assigned airfield survey and/or assessment capability are responsible for managing, training, equipping and quality control of the unit airfield survey program and will appoint an airfield survey program manager (1C7X1, 13M3X or 32E3G) to administer  the  program,  ensure  survey  team  chiefs  and  members  are  properly  trained  and certified and provide quality control of the final airfield survey reports. (T-2) 7.4.  Airfield Survey Tasking Procedures. 7.4.1.  Request  for Airfield  Surveys. Requests for airfield capability assessments  may come from, but are not limited to, the following sources: 7.4.1.1.  AOCs 7.4.1.2.  Planners 7.4.1.3.  MAJCOM A3s 7.4.1.4.  Accident investigation boards 7.4.1.5.  Federal agencies (e.g., State Department) 7.4.1.6.  United States Embassies 7.4.1.7.  Intelligence community 7.4.2.  With  the  exceptions  of  USPACOM  and  USEUCOM,  requestors  without  organic airfield  survey  capability  shall  forward  the  airfield  survey  requests  to  the  combatant command responsible for the airfield for validation prior to submission to USTRANSCOM.  The combatant command will forward valid airfield surveys requests to the USTRANSCOM Deployment and Distribution Operations Center (DDOC) via email using the airfield survey worksheet  contained  in  Attachment  3.    Upon  receipt  of  the  airfield  survey  request worksheet,  the  applicable  USTRANSCOM  DDOC  Regional  Branch  will  review  for  equity and  accuracy  and  then  forward  to  HQ  AMC  (A2A,  A3A,  A3C,  A4R  and  A7O)  and  18 AF/A3 via *Logbook Newsgroup for feasibility recommendation.  HQ AMC/A3 will provide a  coordinated  HQ  AMC  and  18  AF/A3  feasibility  recommendation  to  the  applicable USTRANSCOM  regional  branch.    The  feasibility  recommendation  will  state  whether  an airfield survey is required and supportable, and if not provide an alternate course(s) of action.  USTRANSCOM will notify the combatant command if the survey request will be supported and  will  task  18  AF/A3  to  execute  all  supported  airfield  survey  requests.    Requestors originating within USPACOM and USEUCOM shall forward the airfield survey requests to USPACOM PDDOC and USEUCOM EDDOCs for validation and sourcing of organic CRF assets. 7.4.3.  ASTs may conduct unit funded airfield surveys and/or updates as required for training and  will  inform  their  assigned  controlling  agency  prior  to  survey  teams  departing  home station.  Training will not be conducted in a designated combat zone. (T-3) 7.4.4.  The tasked units and functional experts will conduct the survey and publish the results on an AMC FORM 174 or approved data base, within five duty days of the requested survey completion  date.    If  results  are  needed  prior  to  five  days,  the  essential  information  will  be provided  by  email,  message,  telephone,  facsimile  or  other  expeditious  means.    Airfield AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   75  survey final products provided by CRFs are maintained by HQ AMC/A3 in the GDSS AFD.  To  recommend  immediate  changes  to  protected  GDSS  airfield  suitability  information, contact the HQ AMC Airfield Help Desk at Airfield.Helpdesk@us.af.mil or DSN 779-3112 or DSN FAX 576-2702.  Note:  HQ AMC/A22 maintains classified surveys. (T-3) 7.5.  Accomplishment of Surveys. 7.5.1.  Airfield  surveys  are  valid  for  three  years.  Surveys  over  three  years  old  will  be maintained for archive purposes only.  Generally, survey data should be updated every two years  or  whenever  significant  changes  have  occurred  to  the  airport  or  the  operating environment.    If  no  updates  are  made  within  three  years,  the  entire  survey  should  be  re-accomplished.   Since surveys can be  costly in  terms of funding and manpower,  comments regarding the importance and immediate need for the airfield data should be included. 7.5.2.  For each operation with airfield survey or assessment capability, the CRF commander or  team  chief  is  responsible  for  updating  the  survey  for  each  deployment  location  or certifying that the current survey is still accurate.  In addition, information must be updated in the GDSS Airfield Database.  Minor updates to the AMC FORM 174 may be provided by email,  message  or  letter  to  the  HQ  AMC  Airfield  Help  Desk.    If  major  changes  have occurred, or if the existing AMC FORM 174 is inadequate, a new report is required.  Airfield survey status will be included in deployment AARs. (T-3) 7.5.3.  When personnel cannot perform complete surveys due to restrictions imposed by local authorities, especially foreign governments, team members should attempt to gather as much information  as  permitted.    The  CRF  commander  or  team  chief  will  indicate  on  page  2, Section V, in the summary section of the AMC FORM 174 any limitations encountered (e.g., “limited survey due to restricted parking ramp access; all parking ramp, taxiway and runway data are host nation-provided”). (T-3) 7.6.  Documentation.  AMC FORM 174. Part I, Airfield Data, provides specific information on airfield capabilities to physically handle air mobility aircraft. Part II, Airfield Support, documents facilities to support air mobility operations.  ASTs, in conjunction with functional experts, may be  tasked  to  accomplish  part  or  all  of  the  survey,  depending  on  the  proposed  operation.    All checklist items will be completed or marked “N/A” when appropriate to ensure survey areas are properly identified and not  overlooked during AMC suitability analysis.   The AST may use an HQ AMC/A3C-approved electronic version of the airfield survey checklist.  Completed surveys will be emailed to the HQ AMC Airfield Help Desk.  Each unit conducting a survey will retain a copy for backup and archive purposes until superseded by a newer survey. (T-3) 7.6.1.  Optional documentation using USAF standard Survey Tool for Employment Planning (STEP).  STEP is intended to provide deliberate planning level base capabilities information.  Specific  on-hand  infrastructure  and  potential  maximum  capacity  projections  are  also reviewed.  STEP will provide site survey members a hand-held, automated checklist that will allow  one  time  data  entry.    AST  members  will  be  given  permission  to  update  specific chapters when and if required. 7.7.  Quality of Airfield Surveys.  The AMC FORM 174 must be completed in as much detail as possible.  The following minimum elements will be included: (T-3) 7.7.1.  Top priorities are  runway, taxiway and parking apron measurements, weight  bearing capacity (WBC) values, pavement condition and obstacle information.  Obstacle information   76  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 must  include  location,  height  and  distance  from  runway  or  taxiway  centerline  and  edge  of apron.  Document each obstacle only once with reference to the nearest runway approach end or taxiway/apron edge as appropriate.  For each taxiway and apron indicate whether lighting is  available.    Data  provided  by  the  location’s  Airfield  Manager  (or  equivalent)  should  be verified for accuracy.  If not verified, annotate data as such. 7.7.2.  A final summary reflecting MOG capabilities by type aircraft, special cautions and/or restrictions,  and  additional  assessments  of  capabilities  that  would  help  mission  and  CRF planners  determine  aircraft  and  support  capabilities  and  requirements  at  the  airfield.    The final summary should answer the questions of who, what, where and how much tanker and air  mobility  support  would  be  needed  at  the  location  to  run  a  two  shift  operation  with  the most  demanding  MOG  listed.    Note:  The  team  chief  does  not  make  a  suitability determination,  but  instead  makes  recommendations  as  to  the  capability  of  the  airfield  to support deployed operations.  Recommendations should match the information gathered. 7.7.3.  Measurements  reported  in  feet  measured  to  the  nearest  inch.    Convert  meters  to  feet using 3.281 feet per meter as the conversion factor. 7.7.4.  Attachments  such  as  airfield  diagrams,  digital  photographs,  parking  plan  diagrams, taxi routes, hazardous cargo areas, area maps, city maps, road maps, local checklists, phone numbers,  policies  and  restrictions  are  essential  addendums.    Provide  template  diagrams  of MOG and parking configurations.  Highlight hazardous areas, emergency jettison areas and warning  areas.    Identify  crash,  fire  rescue  capability,  if  any.    Include  locally  produced Standard  Instrument  Departures  (SID)  and  other  airfield  handouts.    Point  out  key  facilities such  as  the  fire  department,  fuels,  in-flight  kitchen,  weather  facility,  motor  pool,  billeting, transient alert, suitable  CRF operating areas,  emergency  water sources and commonly  used marshaling yards.  Editorial content that will not fit in the spaces available on the form may be attached in a Microsoft® Word document. 7.8.  Airfield Survey Database.  AMC FORM 174 is used to update the AMC Airfield Database in GDSS.  Survey team chiefs should also review the database prior to deploying on the airfield survey.  Notify HQ AMC/A3AS of any discrepancies noted in the database. 7.9.  Pilot  Unit  Responsibilities.  Pilot  units  are  responsible  for  improving  the  quality  of  the airfield survey capability by soliciting new ideas and evaluating them. U nit commanders, flight chiefs  and  personnel  conducting  or  compiling  airfield  surveys  are  encouraged  to  submit recommendations  for  improvement  of  the  7E1AM  and  7E1AP  UTCs  to  the  pilot  units.    Pilot units  should  consolidate  and  coordinate  suggestions  and  comments  for  UTCs  and  submit program  recommendations  to  HQ  AMC/A3CM  for  consideration.    Areas  for  improvement include, but are not limited to, content of the survey, written guides for survey teams, procedures and training criteria. AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   77  Chapter 8 GLOBAL MOBILITY C2/BARE BASE BEDDOWN MAINTENANCE PROGRAM 8.1.  Purpose.  The Global  Mobility C2/bare base beddown maintenance program  encompasses all  personnel  and  equipment  assigned  to  a  CRF  unit  for  the  purpose  of  providing communications and bare base beddown support for 7E1XX series UTCs.  This includes line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight voice and data communications systems and operators; automated C2  systems  and  system  administrators;  and  power  generation,  climate  control  equipment, mechanics  and  technicians.    This  chapter  provides  an  explanation  of  the  relationship  between established  USAF  maintenance  practices,  MAJCOM  guidance  and  the  unique  global  mobility communications  and  bare  base  beddown  mission;  only  topics  not  found  in  higher  echelon publications shall be addressed.  In instances where this chapter conflicts with other USAF-level or  higher  echelon  publications,  those  publications  take  precedence.    Conflicts  between  this chapter and existing higher echelon guidance, regardless of circumstance, should be identified to HQ AMC/A3C for resolution. 8.2.  General.  A  CRF  unit  is  considered  a  “mobility-only”  unit.  Communications,  bare  base beddown equipment and personnel are assigned solely to support the unit’s ability to perform its assigned mobility mission. 8.2.1.  Organization.    While  at  home  station,  communications  and  bare  base  beddown maintenance  personnel  should  be  organized  and  staffed  in  the  most  streamlined  manner possible  to  eliminate  parallel  levels  of  supervision  and  management.    Personnel  utilization should  be  technician-oriented  to  maximize  home  station  productivity  with  a  focus  on deployment readiness. 8.2.2.  Funding.  Commanders  should  ensure  their  communications  and  bare  base  beddown maintenance  program  is  properly  equipped  and  funded  to  perform  all  authorized organizational  and  limited  intermediate  level  repair  on  assigned  communications  and  bare base beddown systems, expandable shelters and unit-assigned test equipment. 8.2.3.  Communications  Guidance.    Contingency  response  units  will  use  AFI  33-150, Management  of  Cyberspace  Support  Activities,  as  the  governing  directive  for  all Communications-Electronic  (C-E)  maintenance  activities  and  consider  it  primary  source documentation  for  all  localized  C-E  maintenance  practices  and  maintenance  management policies. (T-3) 8.2.4.  Bare  Base  Beddown  and  Electrical  Power  Production  Guidance.  Units  will  use  AFI 32-1063,  Electric  Power  Systems,  or  32-series  publications  as  the  governing  directive  and primary  source  documentation  for  maintenance  activities  involving  7E1XX  UTC  support equipment  such  as  tactical  generators,  ECUs,  and  power  distribution  panels.    In  the  event bare  base  beddown  maintenance  management  policies  conflict  with  AFI  33-150  or  higher echelon guidance, those publications shall take precedence unless such a default will pose a danger  to  personnel  or  assigned  equipment.    Report  such  conflicts  to  HQ  AMC/A3C immediately for resolution. (T-3) 8.3.  CRF-Unique  Formal  Training.  HQ  AMC/A3  will  ensure  that  CRF-unique  formal training  programs  are  available  and  adequate  to  provide  the  skills  necessary  to  operate  and maintain assigned equipment.   78  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 8.3.1.  The  USAF  EC  is  the  primary  formal  training  provider  for  communications  and  bare base  beddown  personnel.    The  USAF  EC  maintains  a  training  facility  and  qualified instructors to train CRF personnel on communications and bare base beddown equipment in a controlled environment. 8.3.2.  Commercial  training.    Commanders  may  wish  to  leverage  commercial  training opportunities to broaden the expertise of their assigned personnel.  Commercial courses are considered  supplemental  training  opportunities  and  do  not  eliminate  the  requirement  for personnel  to  attend  established  formal  training  courses  or  complete  mandatory  training requirements for the assigned communications and bare base beddown duty position. 8.3.3.  USAF EC Course Development Process.  When requested by the USAF EC, CRF unit commanders  shall  make  every  attempt  to  provide  seasoned  communications  and  bare  base beddown  personnel  to  represent  the  unit  and  serve  as  SMEs  for  both  initial  and  revision levels of Instructional Systems Development (ISD) at USAF EC expense. (T-3) 8.4.  Local Modification of Communications and Bare Base Beddown Equipment.  Units are not authorized to alter, modify, adjust, enhance or in any way change a communications and bare base  beddown  system,  subsystem  or  component  in  a  manner  that  results  in  that  equipment’s inability  to  match  appearance  or  performance  specifications  outlined  within  its  corresponding USAF T.O., manufacturer-issued operating or owner’s manual, or other such publication without written  approval  from  MAJCOM  or  higher  echelon  approval  authority.    All  assigned communications and bare base beddown equipment  shall remain standardized to  the maximum extent possible in order to ensure successful interoperability, sourcing and tasking of inter-CRF communications and bare base beddown assets. (T-3) 8.5.  Mobility Readiness Spares Package.  Units will maintain 50 percent (or one MRSP if only one  7E1XX  UTC  assigned)  of  each  type  of  non-airborne  MRSP  at  home  station  and  ready  to meet deployment response times.  A 7E1XX non-airborne MRSP is not the property of the CRF; it is owned by the host base mission support group or squadron and is signed out to the CRF for use  during  deployments.  Until  a  component  is  extracted  from  the  MRSP,  the  unit  will  not compromise the inventory control seal unless required for shipment and customs inspection.  If the  seal  is  compromised,  the  unit  will  notify  the  Logistics  Readiness  Squadron  as  soon  as possible.  While an MRSP is on loan to the CRF, the unit will cooperate with base supply and allow  them  to  maintain  control  and  accountability  of  each  MRSP.    The  CRF  will  honor  base supply  requests  to  conduct  scheduled  inventories  or  other  inspections  as  deemed  necessary  by the  Logistics  Readiness  Squadron.    When  tasked  to  deploy,  the  CRF  will  contact  the  Logistics Readiness  Squadron,  notify  them  the  MRSP  is  in  deployment  status  and  provide  an  estimated return  date  (with  subsequent  updates  to  firm  the  estimate).    Upon  return  from  deployment,  the CRF  will  follow  established  base  supply  directives  to  restore  and  replenish  the  MRSP  to  pre-deployment condition without a cost incurred by the Logistics Readiness Squadron.  Base supply may  pull  back  items  for  AMC  Mission  Capable  Parts  (MICAP)  or  mission  essential  priorities from other units, but will order and replace these items immediately. (T-3)  TOD D.

Base  Security  Zone  (BSZ).    The  BSZ  is  that  area  from  which  the  enemy  can  launch  an attack  against  the  personnel  and  resources  located  on  or  aircraft  approaching/departing the base.  The Air Force term is similar to, but not synonymous with, the base boundary as defined  in  JP  3—10.    The  base  commander  is  responsible  for  identifying  the  BSZ  and coordinating with the host nation or area commander to align the BSZ with the base boundary.  If the  base  boundary  does  not  include  all  of  the  terrain  of  the  BSZ,  the  base  commander  is  still responsible for either mitigating (through coordination with the area commander or host nation) or accepting the risks of enemy attack from the area outside the base boundary.  The BSZ is not a   94  AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015 Joint  term  and  should  only  be  used  within  Air  Force  communication  channels.  (AFPD  31-1, Integrated Defense) Building  Partnerships  (BP).—The  ability  to  set  the  conditions  for  interaction  with  partner, competitor  or  adversary  leaders,  military  forces,  or  relevant  populations  by  developing  and presenting  information  and  conducting  activities  to  affect  their  perceptions,  will,  behavior,  and capabilities (AMC  Air  Mobility System Building Partnerships Concept of Employment, v.3.4, 2 Aug 2010).

Command  Job  Qualification  Standard  (CJQS).—Comprehensive  task  list  common  to  all persons serving in the duty position, which describe a particular job type or duty position. Contingency  Response  Force  (CRF).—Refers to generic CR teams during mission execution.  A  CRF  may  encompass  anything  from  the  smallest  contingency  support  element  up  to  a  full contingency response group. For the purposes of this AFI, when the term “CRF Commander” is used, it is referring to the following leadership: CRG/CC or CRE/CC.  For the purposes of this AFI, when the term “CRF Team Chief” is used, it is referring to the following leadership: CRT, AST or CSE team chief. Contingency  Response  Group  (CRG).    CRGs  are  designed  to  be  first  responders  for opening  airbases  or  for  expeditionary  missions.    These  units  will  bridge  the  gap  between the seizure forces and the follow—on combat/expeditionary combat support forces.  CRGs are critical to the Air Force’s ability to rapidly deploy U.S. military forces and initiate air operations of any type in minimal time at any base or location around the globe.  CRGs may also provide C2, aerial port services, quick turn maintenance, FP and various airbase support capabilities for the Global Mobility mission.  The CRG CONOP and this instruction describe CRG operations.  HQ AMC/A3C is the functional manager for the CRGs. Contingency  Response  Element  (CRE).    A  provisional,  deployed  AMC  organization established  at  fixed,  en  route,  and  deployed  locations  where  AMC  operational  support  is non—existent or insufficient.

The CRE may also be AFI10-202  14 JULY 2015   95  composed of contingency support elements from various units and deploys in support of Special Assignment  Airlift  Mission  (SAAM),  Joint  Airborne/Air  Transportability  Training  (JA/ATT), tanker support, and contingency and emergency relief missions on both planned and “no notice” basis.  Since CREs are deployed primarily to  support AMC’s global  air  mobility mission, they will normally remain under the OPCON of AFTRANS. Contingency  Response  Team  (CRT).    Performs  the  same  function  as  a  CRE,  but  on  a smaller  scale.  CRTs  are  normally  led  by  and  enlisted  7—level  member  certified  as  a  CRT Chief. Contingency  Response  Wing  (CRW).    The  Air  Forces  global  reach  crisis  response  force.  The CRW is a home station organization that rapidly deploys tailorable, multi—role, multi-skilled, expeditionary mobility teams, organized to quickly assess and effectively open forward contingency  airbases  and  conduct  air  mobility  support  operations  anywhere  in  the  world.  The CRW ensures mission-ready airfield assessment teams, airfield operations, C2, aerial port, quick-turn aircraft maintenance, weather, intelligence, ATC, security forces, finance, fuels, supply, and contracting personnel are available to project and sustain combat forces worldwide. Contingency Support Element (CSE).  CSEs are a small scale standalone entity consisting of personnel and equipment to make up a deployed contingency support capability without C2 (e.g., aerial port joint inspection,  contingency load planning team, in—transit visibility, etc). Director of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR).—The DIRMOBFOR is a senior mobility officer who is familiar with the area of responsibility and possesses extensive background in air mobility operations.  The DIRMOBFOR exercises coordinating authority between the AOC, TACC and the joint movement center to facilitate resolution of air mobility issues.  The DIRMOBFOR may be  sourced  from  within  the  GCC's  organizations  or  USTRANSCOM.  Normally,  the DIRMOBFOR  is  attached  to  the  COMAFFOR‘s  special  staff  and  should  be  given  appropriate liaison  authority.  The DIRMOBFOR provides advice to  the AMD on air mobility matters that should be responsive to the timing and tempo of AOC operations.  The AMD remains under the control of the AOC commander who manages the execution of operations for the COMAFFOR. Force Health Protection (FHP).—FHP is a strategy that uses preventive health techniques and emerging technologies in environmental surveillance and combat medicine to protect all service members  before,  during  and  after  deployment.    It  is  designed  to  improve  the  health  of  service members,  prepare  them  for  deployment,  prevent  casualties  and  promptly  treat  injuries  or illnesses that do occur. the  airfield Geodetic/ATCALS  Survey.—A  survey  providing  geodetic  coordinates  of infrastructure (e.g., runway & NAVIAD coordinates/elevations) used in TERPS development of TPA. Global  Mobility  Forces.    Generic  term  referring  to  “deployed”  personnel  and  equipment from  any  of  the  following  organizations:  ALCF,  AMS  (USAFE—  AFAFRICA/PACAF), CRG, CRW, GMRS, GMS.

Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC).—The JFACC derives authority from the JFC  who  has  authority  to  exercise  OPCON,  assign  missions,  direct  coordination  among subordinate  commanders,  redirect  and  organize  forces  to  ensure  unity  of  effort  in  the accomplishment  of  the  overall  mission.  The  JFC  will  normally  designate  a  JFACC.    The JFACC’s  responsibilities  will  normally  be  assigned  by  the  JFC  (normally  these  would  include, but  not  be  limited  to,  planning,  coordination,  allocation,  and  tasking  based  on  the  JFC’s apportionment decision).  Using the JFC’s guidance and authority, and in conjunction with other Service component commanders and other assigned or supporting commanders, the JFACC will recommend to the JFC apportionment of air sorties to various missions or geographic areas. Minimum  Lighting.—Minimum  lighting  is  defined  as  conditions  requiring  the  use  of  night vision  devices  (NVDs)  to  enhance  existing  light  to  a  level  in  which  ground  crew  can  support operations.
