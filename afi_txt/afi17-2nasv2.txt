SEEs  will  use  the  grading  policies  contained  in  AFI  17-202V2  and  the  evaluation criteria  in  this  instruction  for  conducting  all  AFSPC  and  AFSPC-oversight  units’  weapon system performance and Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). All evaluations assume a stable platform and normal operating conditions. (T-3) 1.4.2.  Squadron  will  design  and  maintain  evaluation  profiles  for  each  NAS  CMR  position. These  profiles,  approved  by  the  Operations  Group  (OG)  Stan/Eval  office  (OGV),  should outline the minimum number and type of events to be performed/observed in order to satisfy a complete evaluation. Evaluation profiles will incorporate requirements set in the applicable grading criteria and reflect the primary unit tasking. (T-3) 1.4.3.  All evaluations fall under the Qualification (QUAL), Mission (MSN) or Spot (SPOT) categories listed in AFI 17-202V2. For specific details on updating the AF Form 4418, refer to unit Operating Instructions. (T-3) 4 AFI17-2NASV2  10 FEBRUARY 2017 1.4.3.1.  Schedule all evaluation activity on one sortie to the greatest extent possible. All performance phase requirements should be accomplished during a simulated sortie. (T-3) 1.4.3.2.  During all evaluations, any events observed by the evaluator may be  evaluated. If additional training is required for areas outside of the scheduled evaluation, document the training required under the appropriate area on the AF Form 4418. (T-3) 1.4.3.3.  Written requisites and the grading criteria for various evaluations can be found at a  higher  classification.  For  copies  of  this  material,  requestors  must  contact  the  unit Security Office. 1.4.3.4.  Unit  examiners  may  give  evaluations  outside  of  their  organization  to  include administering  evaluations  between  AFSPC,  AFRC  and  ANG  provided  written agreements/understandings  between  the  affected  organizations  are  in-place.  Written agreements/understandings shall be reviewed and updated annually. (T-2) 1.4.4.  Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in the grading, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective  action and such deviations  do not  jeopardize safety or the mission. Cumulative deviations will be considered when determining the overall grade. The SEE will state the examinee’s overall rating, review with the examinee the area grades assigned,  thoroughly  critique  specific  deviations,  and  recommend/assign  any  required additional training. (T-3) 1.4.5.  Use evaluators as instructors for any phase of training for which they are qualified to capitalize on their expertise and experience. SEEs will not evaluate students with whom they have  instructed  50%  of  the  qualification/upgrade  training  or  those  they  recommend  for qualification/upgrade  evaluation  without  Squadron  (SQ)/CC  approval.  Additionally,  SEEs will  not  evaluate  direct  supervisors  or  personal  on  their  assigned  crew  without  SQ/CC approval. (T-3) 1.4.6.  All  crewmembers  for  the  mission/sortie  (to  include  students,  instructors,  examinees, and  evaluators)  will  participate  in  and  adhere  to  all  required  mission  planning,  mission briefing, mission execution, and mission debriefing requirements. (T-3) 1.5.  General Evaluation Requirements. 1.5.1.  Publications  Check.  The  squadron  Mission  Management  office  will  list  all  required publications for employment of the NAS. (T-3) 1.5.2.  Written Examinations: 1.5.2.1.  The  written  examination  will  be  accomplished  prior  to  the  mission/sortie performance phase unless in conjunction with a No-Notice (N/N) QUAL. (T-3) 1.5.3.  Emergency  Action  Procedures  (EAP).  Every  Qualification  evaluation  which  updates an  expiration  date  will  include  an  EAP.  EAPs  will  evaluate  the  crewmember’s  knowledge and/or performance of emergency procedures, to include use of emergency equipment. (T-3) 1.5.4.  Qualification  (QUAL)  Evaluations.  These  evaluations  measure  a  crewmember’s ability to meet grading areas listed in unit Operating Instructions in accordance with (IAW) AFI  17-202V2  and  weapon  system-specific  guidance.  When  practical,  QUAL  evaluations should be combined with Instructor evaluations, as applicable for the crew position. (T-3) AFI17-2NASV2  10 FEBRUARY 2017 5 1.5.5.  Mission  (MSN)  Evaluations.  IAW  AFI  17-202V2  and  weapon  system-specific guidance, the requirement for a separate MSN evaluation may be combined with the QUAL evaluation. Mission certifications will be IAW AFI 17-202 Vol 1, AFI 17-2.NAS Vol 1, and all applicable supplements and will be documented in the appropriate training folder. (T-3) 1.5.5.1.  For cybercrew members who maintain multiple mission certifications, recurring evaluations  need  only  evaluate  the  primary  mission  events  as  long  as  currency  is maintained in all other required training events. (T-3) 1.5.6.  Instructor Evaluations. Grading areas for these evaluations are listed in unit Operating Instructions and must meet all requirements from AFI 17-202V2 and weapon system-specific guidance. (T-3) 1.5.7.  SEE  Objectivity  Evaluations.    Grading  areas  for  these  evaluations  are  listed  in  unit Operating  Instructions  and  must  meet  all  requirements  from  AFI  17-202V2  and  weapon system-specific guidance. (T-3) 1.5.8.  No-Notice  Evaluations.  The  Operations  Group  Commander  (OG/CC)  will  determine no-notice evaluation procedures/goals. (T-3) 1.6.  Grading  Instructions.  Standards  and  performance  parameters  are  contained  in  AFI  17-202V2 and this instruction. A three-level grading system is used for most areas; however a "Q-" grade will not be indicated under critical areas. (T-3) 1.6.1.  Critical Area/Subarea. Critical areas are events that require adequate accomplishment by the examinee in order to successfully and safely achieve the mission/sortie objectives and complete  the  evaluation.  These  events,  if  not  adequately  accomplished  could  result  in mission failure, endanger human life, or cause serious injury or death. Additionally, critical areas/subareas  apply  to  time-sensitive  tasks  or  tasks  that  must  be  accomplished  as expeditiously  as  possible  without  any  intervening  lower  priority  actions  that  would,  in  the normal  sequence  of  events,  adversely  affect  task  performance/outcome.  If  an  examinee receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be "Q-3." Critical areas are identified by "(C)" following the applicable area title. (T-3) 1.6.2.  Major  Area/Subarea.  Major  areas  are  events  or  tasks  deemed  integral  to  the performance of other tasks and required to sustain acceptable weapon system operations and mission execution. If an examinee receives a "U" grade in a non-critical area then the overall grade awarded will be no higher than "Q-2." An examinee receiving a "Q-" grade in a non-critical  area  or  areas  may  still  receive  a  "Q-1"  overall  grade  at  evaluator  discretion.  An overall "Q-3" can be awarded if, in the judgment of the SEE, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas. Major areas are identified by "(M)" following the applicable area title. (T-3) 1.6.3.  Minor Area/Subarea. Minor areas are rudimentary or simple tasks related to weapons system  operations  that  by  themselves  have  little  or  no  impact  on  mission  execution.  Minor areas are identified by "(m)" following the applicable area title. (T-3) 1.6.4.  If an examinee receives  a  "U"  grade in  a  non-critical  (major or minor) area then the overall grade awarded will be no higher than "Q-2." An examinee receiving a "Q-" grade in a non-critical area or areas may still receive a "Q-1" overall grade at evaluator discretion. An 6 AFI17-2NASV2  10 FEBRUARY 2017 overall "Q-3" can be awarded if, in the judgment of the SEE, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas. (T-3) 1.6.5.  The SEE must  exercise judgment  when the wording of  areas is  subjective and when specific situations are not covered. (T-3) 1.6.6.  Evaluator  judgment  will  be  the  final  determining  factor  in  deciding  the  overall qualification level. (T-3) Table 1.1.  Crew Position/Upgrade Evaluation Requirements (T-3).
