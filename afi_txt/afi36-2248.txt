Evaluate and prioritize SIMCERT deficiencies and discrepancies as requested by the 29TSS.5.5. SIMCERT Certification, Decertification, Recertification, and Reporting:5.5.1. Initial Certification.   New as well as existing ATDs undergoing hardware or software modi-fications require initial cer tification.  Initial certification verifies  and documents a Training ValueCode (TVC) for each training event that the new or modified device meets.   Additionally, if the ATDis to be used for MAJCOM 11-series flying training events, each event must receive a Training ValueCode (TVC) 1 to be creditable.  Software block updates and hardware modifications will normally beinitially certified on the first representative ATD installation after Air Force acceptance testing is com-plete.  Certification of subsequent devices receiving the exact same modification may be conducted bythe units or by the 29 TSS, depending on the complexity of the modification and the previous certifi-cation results, as approved by the 29 TSS.  All ot her initial SIMCERTs will be conducted by the 29TSS SIMCERT team or 29 TSS designated augmentees.5.5.2. Recurring Certification.   Recurring certification ensures the training device continues to per-form to the initial cer tification standards.  Annual recur ring certification is on a  calendar year cycleIAW the MAJCOM approved master schedule and the appropriate master plan.5.5.3. Decertification.   Assignment of a TVC of 4 decer tifies that event for aircrew trai ning untilcorrection of  the discrepancy.  SIMCERT personnel will then recertify that event.  Decertificationconsists of deleting training tasks from the list  of tasks for which the training device ha s been certi-fied.5.5.4. Recertification.   Recertification consists of testing of the decertified tasks and any oth eraffected tasks.
