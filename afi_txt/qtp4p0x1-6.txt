OBJECTIVE     Controlled Substance Management     PAGES 3 – 24                                2     INTRODUCTION 1.  This Qualification Training Package (QTP) was developed to enhance and standardize on-the-job  training  for  4P0X1  personnel.    As  a  trainer,  the  QTPs  provide  teachable  elements  of  task breakdowns.  The teachable elements will assist in guiding the trainee towards independent task performance, proficiency, and serve as an evaluation tool for trainers/certifiers. 2.    Review  the  volume(s)  of  the  Career  Development  Course(s)  (CDCs)  and  identify  which module(s) of the QTP is needed for the trainee’s job position or upgrade skill-level training.  The QTP training for each module should be accomplished in the order which most closely mirrors the area in which the trainee is working.  Items in column 2 of the Pharmacy Job Qualification Standard (JQS)/Specialty Training Standard (STS) marked with a 5 or 7 are core tasks for the 4P career field.  Additional proficiency training may be required for these tasks at the supervisor’s discretion.  3.  Ensure the trainee reviews the training references in each module prior to attempting any task or QTP evaluation.  Review the performance checklist and training objective with the trainee.  If the trainee has questions about the objective, clarify the desired outcome/results of performance, demonstration or completion of the task.  Remember the objective of each QTP is to standardize training  and  allow  sufficient  time  for  the  trainee  to  learn  each  task  thoroughly  to  be  able  to perform the task independently.   4.  When the trainee has received sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on the objective, follow the evaluation instructions.  The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate each task  objective.    When  the  trainee  successfully  demonstrates  and  accomplishes  the  objective, document  the  task  completion  appropriately  in  the  member’s  Air  Force  Training  Record (AFTR). 5.    The  QTP  task  completion  is  to  be  annotated  as  a  623A  comment  in  the  trainee’s  AFTR.  NOTE:  The individual checklists and final evaluations are not filed in each member’s user files. 6.  If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas needing further instruction.  Conduct feedback for each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in the member’s AFTR.  The trainee will be re-evaluated until the objective is met. 7.  If a task being trained requires third party certification by a certifier/certifying official, the trainer ensures trainee is qualified to perform the task independently.  The trainee will then be evaluated by certifier/certifying official.  Tasks requiring certification are identified in column 2 of  JQS  with  a  number  sign  (#).    The  certifier/certifying  official  will  ensure  that  a  trainer  has signed off the task in the trainer column prior to signing off the task in the certifier column in AFTR.  3  8.    Tasks  associated  with  a  QTP  are  identified  in  column  4D  of  the  STS.    The  QTPs  are  a necessary tool for standardizing task qualifications for upgrade training or job position training.  Such  standardization  benefits  the  JQS  training  concept  throughout  a  member’s  career.    These documents may also be used in assessing/certifying pharmacy technicians upon arrival at a new duty station. 9.  Feedback is a vital and important part of improving our educational process for pharmacy technicians.    Your  first  hand  expertise  is  valued  and  your  feedback  is  highly  encouraged  to ensure we have the most up-to-date information and training possible.   Trainees should direct all inquiries to their immediate supervisor.                                   4   SUBJECT AREA:  Controlled Substances Management  TASK NAME(S):  Procedures: Adding new drug to CHCS; New Issue Entry; Decrement from Controlled  Inventory;  Add  to  Controlled  Inventory;  Adjust  to  Inventory;  Complete  RX Transaction;  Return  RX  Transaction;  Remove  RX  Transaction;  Cancel  a  Prescription; Discontinue a Prescription  JQS/STS REFERENCE(S):  8.4.1.; 8.4.2.; 8.4.3.; 8.4.4.; 8.4.5.; 8.4.6.; 8.4.6.1.
