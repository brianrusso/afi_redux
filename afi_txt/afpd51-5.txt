Compliance with claims policy will be measured in two areas: Time to adjudicate claims andamount paid versus amount claimed.A1.1.1. Time To Adjudicate Claims. The policies to expeditiously investigate and process claims,to promptly pay claims, and to timely assert claims will be measured by determining the percentage ofpersonnel claims processed within 10 days, with an Air Force goal of 80 percent.  The Claims Admin-istrative Management Program (CAMP) will produce a percentage figure for personnel claims pro-cessed within 10 days by base, NAF, MAJCOM, and Air Force-wide.  Figures will be chartedannually for the preceding 2 fiscal years and quarterly for the present fiscal year (figure A1.1).A1.1.2. Amount Paid Versus Amount Claimed. The policy that personnel will be compensated forthe fair market value of their property (lost, stolen, or destroyed) incident to service will be measuredby the calculation by CAMP of the percentage of the dollar amount of personnel transportation claimspaid during the fiscal year divided by the dollar amount of personnel transportation claims claimedduring the fiscal year.  Figures will be charted annually for the preceding 2 fiscal years and quarterlyfor the present fiscal year.  These figures will be compared against the Air Force 15-year mean for thispercentage with variation limits defined as one standard deviation above and below that mean (figureA1.2).A1.1.3. Legal Assistance and Preventive Law.  The percentage of personnel tasked for deploymentwho are briefed on their personal legal needs and receive mission-related legal assistance will beassessed on an annual basis (figure A1.3).5Figure A1.1.
