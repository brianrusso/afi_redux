Doctrine:  Provides  fundamental  principles  by  which  military  forces  guide  their  action  in support of national objectives. Air Force Doctrine Annex 3-51, Electronic Warfare Operations, defines electronic warfare (EW) as military action involving the use of the electromagnetic (EM) and directed energy (DE) to control the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) or to attack the enemy. 1.1.1.  The EMS is divided into three portions: 1.1.1.1.  Radio  Frequency  (RF)  used  by  communications  systems  such  as  radios, cellphones, WIFI wireless networking technology and data links, radars such as airborne intercept, air defense or navigation and millimeter-wave systems. 1.1.2.  Electro-Optic  (EO)  which  includes  infrared  (IR),  visible  light,  and  ultraviolet  (UV) sub-divisions, used by flares or infrared countermeasures systems or lasers. 1.1.3.  Ray which includes gamma rays, X-Rays, etc. 1.2.  Three  Major  Components  of  EW.  Electronic  Attack  (EA),  Electronic  Protection  (EP), and Electronic Warfare Support (ES). 1.2.1.  EA  involves  the  use  of  electromagnetic  energy,  DE,  or  anti-radiation  weapons  to attack personnel, facilities, or equipment.  The primary effects achieved by EA are deception, disruption, denial, degradation and destruction.  Creating precise EA effects will also require use  of  a  battle  management  function.    This  includes  spectrum  management  to  ensure electromagnetic  spectrum  deconfliction  in  multiple  dimensions  (e.g.  time,  altitude  and distance). 1.2.1.1.  EA includes any actions taken to prevent or reduce an enemy's effective use of the  EM  spectrum.    Techniques  include  jamming,  electromagnetic  deception,  or  direct attack of an enemy's electronic capabilities through the employment of weapons that use either electromagnetic energy or DE (e.g. lasers, radio frequency, high power microwave [HPM]  weapons,  and  particle  beams)  as  their  primary  disruptive  or  destructive mechanism. 1.2.1.2.  Examples  of  EA  systems  include:  Jammers  onboard  the  EC-130H,  COMPASS CALL,  F-16CJ  with  High-Speed  Anti-Radiation  Missiles  (HARMs),  chaff,  flares,  self-protection jamming systems, Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM), active towed decoys, and counter remote/radio controlled improvised explosive device (RCIED) systems. 1.2.2.  EP  involves  means  taken  to  protect  personnel,  facilities,  and  equipment  from  the effects of friendly or enemy employment of EA or other EM spectrum capabilities (such as an  electromagnetic  pulse  [EMP])  that  have  the  potential  to  degrade,  neutralize,  or  destroy friendly  combat  capability.    Examples  of  EP  include:  frequency/pulse  repetition  frequency (RF/PRF) agility, or laser eye protection (LEP). 1.2.3.  ES involves actions tasked by, or under direct control of, an operational commander to search  for,  intercept,  identify,  and  locate  sources  of  intentional  and  unintentional  radiated 6 AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 electromagnetic energy for the purpose of immediate threat recognition, targeting, planning, and conduct of future operations.  Examples of ES systems include: radar and laser warning receivers  (RWR/LWR),  the  HARM  targeting  system,  sensors  forward  capabilities,  Rapid Attack Identification, Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS), GPS jammer geo-location systems or the Battlefield Laser Detection System (BLADES). 1.3.  Doctrinal Tenets.  EW employs the following doctrinal tenets: 1.3.1.  Control.  Achieved  by  means  of  effective  management  and  coordination  of  friendly EW  systems  that  protect  friendly  use  of  and  deny  adversary  access  to  key  areas  of  the electromagnetic spectrum.   Electronic Warfare  Battle Management (EWBM) is  an example of an EW function that could be used to improve control of EW resources. 1.3.2.  Exploit.  To  exploit  is  to  use  the  EM  spectrum  to  the  advantage  of  friendly  forces.  Friendly forces can use deception, disruption, denial, degradation and destruction in varying degrees to impede the adversary’s decision loop.  For instance, one may use electromagnetic deception to convey misleading information to an enemy or use an enemy’s electromagnetic emissions to locate and identify the enemy. 1.3.3.  Enhance.  Enhancers  are  those  intangibles  that  allow  EW  to  function  as  a  force multiplier, from self-protection to operational attack, thus greatly improving the likelihood of mission success on multiple levels of conflict.  The primary example of an EW enhancer is the training function. 1.3.4.  The  tenets  are  used  by  EA,  EP  and  ES  to  produce  the  effects  of  detection,  denial, disruption,  deception  and  destruction  in  varying  degrees  to  enhance  overall  mission objectives. 1.4.  EW’s  primary  functions  in  air  operations  are  to  :  a)  support  air  campaigns  through counter-IADS;  b)  support  Suppression  of  Enemy  Air  Defenses  (SEAD);  c)  disrupt  military  C2 nodes; and d) disrupt non-IADS systems.  EW supports operations such as offensive counterair and defensive counterair as described in AFDD 3-01, Counterair Operations, as well as SEAD.  In  fact,  EW  assets  are  frequently  the  most  vital  to  any  effective  operation  to  suppress  enemy command and control (C2), integrated air defense systems (IADS), and other significant military capabilities  utilizing  the  EMS.    Not  only  are  friendly  EW  capabilities  critical,  enemy  EW operations, if left unhindered, could have devastating effects on friendly C2 systems.  Early and persistent efforts should be aimed at defeating enemy EW capabilities. 1.5.  EW  :  Is  evolving  due  to  technological  advances  and  an  increasing  reliance  on  the  EMS within military and civilian sectors. 1.5.1.  While  EW  retains  its  traditional  role  in  counterair,  it  intersects  or  supports  other military  capabilities  such  as  spectrum  management,  irregular  warfare  (IW),  navigation warfare (NAVWAR) and information, cyberspace, and space operations. 1.5.1.1.  Joint Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (JEMSO) are the coordinated efforts of  EW  and  joint  electromagnetic  spectrum  management  operations  to  exploit,  attack, protect, and manage the electromagnetic environment (EME). 1.5.1.2.  During  IW, EW can influence adversary and/or friendly population in an effort to win popular support. AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 7 1.5.1.3.  Information  Operations  (IO)  is,  “the  integrated  employment,  during  military operations, of information-related capabilities in concert with other lines of operation to influence,  disrupt,  corrupt,  or  usurp  the  decision-making  of  adversaries  and  potential adversaries  while  protecting  our  own”  (JP  3-13).    EW  contributes  to  IO  by  using offensive and defensive tactics to shape, disrupt and exploit adversarial used of the EMS while protecting friendly freedom of action.  As an information-related capability (IRC), EW can stand alone in a traditional function, or can enable, support, and enhance its sister IRCs.  Proper execution of EW activities is critical when supporting other IRCs such as Offensive  Cyberspace  Operations  (OCO),  Military  Information  Support  Operations (MISO)  or  military  deception  (Ref  to  Information  Operations,  AFDD  3-13).  The operational  level  continues  to  be  the  optimal  place  for  the  synchronization  of  IRC activities  (Ref  to  Attachment  2,  USAF  EW  Support  to  Joint  Task  Forces).    Due  to  the complementary nature of and potential synergistic effects of EW and computer network operations,  each  must  be  coordinated.    EW  capabilities  may  permit  use  of  the electromagnetic  spectrum  as  a  maneuver  space  for  cyberspace  operations.    EW capabilities  may  serve  as  a  means  of  accessing  otherwise  inaccessible  networks  to conduct cyberspace operations; presenting new opportunities for offensive action as well as the need for defensive preparations. 1.5.2.  As  our  recognition  of  EW  capability  intersections  with  other  areas  (i.e.  cyberspace, information  and  space  operations)  grows,  our  need  to  address  the  growing  list  of  networks using commercial technologies grows also.  Emerging non-IADS targets include non-military leadership  networks,  commercial/media  networks,  communications  networks,  positioning, navigation,  timing  networks,  and  others  as  directed  by  a  combatant  commander  (CCDR).  EW  targeting  must  comply  with  applicable  rules  of  engagement  and  the  law  of  armed conflict. 8 AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 Chapter 2 ORGANIZATIONS, ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Introduction  to  EW  Training.  This  chapter  provides  a  broad  overview  of  basic  to advanced  levels  of  EW  training  accomplished  in  the  classroom,  in-flight  as  a  single  ship  and during large force exercises. Proficiency in Air Force EW operations begins with having quality training programs. Training programs must have attainable objectives that are specific, relevant, and  necessary.  They  must  address  full-spectrum  operations  and  use  the  full  range  of  training devices, local training operations, and exercises to hone individual skill sets. 3.1.1.  Proficiency in Air Force EW operations begins with having quality training programs.  Training programs must have attainable objectives that are specific, relevant, and necessary.  They must address full-spectrum operations and use the full range of training devices, local training operations, and exercises to hone individual skill sets. 3.2.  Levels  of EW Training.  Basic, senior, continuation, and advanced, levels of EW training will correspond to requirements at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare. This training will integrate both space and cyber capabilities as they relate to EW. 3.2.1.  Basic  Level  Training:   Air Education and  Training Command (AETC) has oversight for  conducting  basic  EW  training.    The  primary  method  for  qualification  will  be  the completion  of  the  appropriate  formal  training  course  listed  in  the  Education  and  Training Course Announcement (ETCA). 3.2.2.  Senior  Level  Training:    AETC  will  continue  to  provide  an  upper-level  program  that focuses on the integration of full-spectrum IO and Cyber capabilities into the campaign plan. 3.2.3.  Continuation Training:  MAJCOMs will define both individual and crew EW training requirements across all skill levels. 3.2.3.1.  For rated individuals (EWO AFSC) continuation training will be daily, weekly, or quarterly for all personnel assigned to wing/squadron levels.  Training will be outlined in each aircraft platform’s respective 11-series Air Force instructions. 3.2.3.2.  Individuals  holding  an  “E”  prefix  and  used  to  fill  a  EW-related  Request  for Forces (RFF) from  the acquisition, engineering, test  and evaluation,  communications or intelligence communities will be mission ready IAW HAF, MAJCOM or Numbered Air Force (NAF) guidance prior to deployment. 3.2.4.  Advanced  Level  Training:    The  CAF,  in  coordination  with  AETC,  has  oversight  for advanced  EW  training  above  the  unit  level  to  provide  an  in-depth  knowledge  of  national assets, EA targeting, and joint/combined operations necessary to equip the commander with integrated EW capabilities in an effort to meet operational objectives.  NOTE: Hands-on, in depth  graduate  level  engineering  courses  are  available  to  EW  acquisition  and  engineering professionals  through  the  EW  T&E  University,  operated  and  maintained  by  the  771TS/412 EWG, Edwards AFB, CA.  EW testing requires an extensive understanding of threat systems, threat  modes,  range  assets,  and  various  EW  systems  under  test.    Engineers  need  to understand  the  importance  of  emerging  threats,  proliferation,  threat  laydowns,  and  threat functionality  to  better  develop  effective  test  methodology.    EW  T&E  U  provides  classified course  offerings  that  are  not  available  to  the  general  public.    The  courses  are  intended  to AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 19 provide  an  array  of  EW  knowledge  to  beginner  engineers  as  well  as  build,  develop,  and maintain EW engineering expertise for those more experienced professionals. 3.3.  Coalition  operations.  Coalition  operations  create  unique  challenges  on  the  battlefield. Therefore  the  entire  Air  Force  EW  community  will  maintain  awareness  of  foreign  system capabilities to determine their interoperability within a coalition environment. 3.4.  EW  Exercises.  The  culmination  of  EW  effectiveness  and  integration  is  best  evaluated during  exercises  and  will  address  Force  Application  (FA)  and  Force  Protection  (FP)  Tactics, Techniques,  and  Procedures  (TTP)  to  measure  how  well  specific  EW  capabilities  support  Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) requirements. 3.4.1.  Exercises can take on many levels of sophistication ranging from unit-level exercises to  AEF  preparation.    Whenever  possible,  the  57th  Adversary  Tactics  Group  and  similar opposing force (OPFOR) organizations will be incorporated to emulate adversary EW from ground, air, space, or cyberspace.  Exercise scenario developers must take into account EW targets  and  effects  in  the  battlespace  since  non-kinetic  attacks  are  challenging  to  integrate into scripts. 3.4.2.  Large force exercises (e.g., Red, Blue, Green and Cyber Flags) will incorporate both offensive and defensive EA activities.  SERENE BYTE reprogramming activities should be considered  for  inclusion  during  all  large  force  exercises.    Where  possible,  activities  should include other services and allied partners to fully exploit joint/combined operational training opportunities. 3.5.  Training Requirements.  Organizations employing EW resources should regularly analyze their EW training and their associated enablers to modify or establish new training requirements as needed. MAJCOMs will assess the quality of EW training and identify any gaps or shortfalls. 20 AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 Chapter 4 MATERIEL DEVELOPMENT, SUSTAINMENT & READINESS 4.1.  Development.  Title  10  United  States  Code  (USC)  statutory  responsibilities  outline  Air Force  functions  of  “organize,  train  and  equip.”  The  equip  function  includes  activities  such  as acquisition,  maintenance,  and  repair  of  military  equipment.  The  Joint  Capabilities  Integration and  Development  System  (JCIDS)  is  used  to  determine  the  requirement  for  and  support  of  the acquisition of a materiel EW solution to a validated capability gap. JCIDS is a key component of the  Capabilities-Based  Planning  (CBP)  process  and  operates  hand-in-hand  with  the  Planning, Programming,  Budgeting  and  Execution  (PPBE)  process.  The  guidance  contained  in  this document  does  NOT  take  precedence  over  that  found  in  AFI  10-601  when  validating  EW requirements.  In  addition,  information  from  this  document  will  be  used  in  concert  with  the guidance found in AFI 10-604, Capabilities-Based Planning, and AFI 63-101/20-101. 4.1.1.  The Air Force defines its core duties and responsibilities into thirteen core functions to be  used  across  the  DOTMLPF  spectrum.  The  core  functions  are:  Air  Superiority  (AS), Global  Persistent  Attack  (GPA),  Education  and  Training  (ET),  Personnel  Recovery  (PR), Command  and  Control  (C2),  Global  Integrated  ISR  (GIISR),  Nuclear  Deterrence  (ND), Space  Superiority  (SS),  Cyber  Superiority  (CS),  Special  Operations  (SO),  Rapid  Global Mobility (GPM), Agile Combat Support (ACS), and Building Partnerships (BP). MAJCOMs will  develop  requirements  for,  acquire,  field,  operate  and  sustain  EW  capabilities  and  EW-related systems that achieve desired effects in order to control the electromagnetic spectrum in support of the core functions. 4.1.1.1.  The  Air  Force  defines  its  core  duties  and  responsibilities  into  thirteen  core functions  to  be  used  across  the  DOTMLPF  spectrum.  The  core  functions  are:    Air Superiority  (AS),  Global  Persistent  Attack  (GPA),  Education  and  Training  (ET), Personnel  Recovery  (PR),  Command  and  Control  (C2),  Global  Integrated  ISR  (GIISR), Nuclear  Deterrence  (ND),  Space  Superiority  (SS),  Cyber  Superiority  (CS),  Special Operations  (SO),  Rapid  Global  Mobility  (GPM),  Agile  Combat  Support  (ACS),  and Building  Partnerships  (BP).    MAJCOMs  will  develop  requirements  for,  acquire,  field, operate  and  sustain  EW-related  systems  that  achieve  desired  effects  in  order  to  control the electromagnetic spectrum in support of the core functions. 4.1.2.  Developers,  operators,  planners,  or  Subject  Matter  Experts  (SMEs)  involved  with developing  new  EW  systems  must  understand  the  EME  to  ensure  fielded  systems  can achieve  desired  effects  and  to  prevent  undesired  effects  from  occurring.    These  fielded capabilities  must  be  deconflicted  with  other  capabilities  being  employed  in  or  across  the entire battlespace to prevent fratricide within the EMS. 4.1.3.  Test and evaluation relies on support from the acquisition and exploitation activities of the Air Force FMP to provide data on the technical and operational vulnerabilities of foreign systems. 4.1.3.1.  EW-related  testing  must  occur  in  the  most  operationally  representative  and relevant environment practical.  Therefore, the Air Force FMP will provide representative systems  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.    AFMC  test  and  evaluation  organizations provide threat representative EW systems when FMP assets are not available. AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 21 4.1.3.2.  A systematic understanding of the concept of threat employment, capability, and proliferation  is  necessary  to  determine  the  priority  for  acquisition  of  new  adversary systems  or  upgrades  to  older  systems.    Conclusions  obtained  from  the  FMP/Foreign Materiel  Exploitation  (FME)  will  be  incorporated  into  the  appropriate  target  and  threat analysis  documents.    During  resource  prioritization,  consideration  will  be  given  to  the exploitation  of  non-IADS  emitters,  when  appropriate,  in  addition  to  traditional  IADS emitters. 4.2.  Sustainment.  This  section  provides  guidance  to  agencies  charged  with  EW  sustainment efforts related to EWIR and test & evaluation associated with EW systems. 4.2.1.  EWIR is a systematic process designed to  increase aircrew survivability and mission success  while  operating  in  an  environment  characterized  by  friendly,  neutral,  and  hostile systems  that  use  the  EMS.   EWIR  provides  the  Commander,  Air  Force  Forces (COMAFFOR),  Joint  Force  Air  Component  Commander  (JFACC)  or  Combined  Force  Air Component  Commander  (CFACC)  as  well  as  units  a  timely  and  accurate  means  to  detect, identify  and  respond  to  electromagnetic  emissions.    EWIR  functions  within  the  scope  of electronic  warfare  (EW)  are  governed  by  AFI  10-703,  Electronic  Warfare  Integrated Reprogramming. 4.2.2.  Testing of EW related mission data software changes, minor system software changes, and minor hardware changes must be conducted in accordance with the processes outlined in AFI  99-103  and  AFI  33-580.    When  performing  EA  in  the  US  and  Canada  for  testing, training, and/or exercises, users will comply with CJCSM 3212.02C.  Spectrum-related data shall be collected and administered in accordance with DoDI 8320.05. 4.3.  Readiness.  Lead  MAJCOMs  are  charged  with  the  responsibility  of  conducting  readiness assessments of EW systems associated with their weapons platforms on at least an annual basis.  Assessments will also be conducted on support equipment and training devices. 4.3.1.  AFLCMC  and  the  Air  Force  Sustainment  Center  having  EW  self-protection (Defensive EA) systems within their portfolio will coordinate with the respective MAJCOM requirements  communities  on  state  of  health  reports  identifying  key  system  shortfalls,  gaps or  future  trends.    These  reports  will  be  forwarded  onto  AF/A2C,  A2D,  A2R,  A3O,  A4L, A5R, or A5X for follow-on Air Staff actions. 4.3.2.  MAJCOMs  will  establish  readiness  standards  for  EW  systems  based  on  their operational  requirements  to  ensure  sufficient  numbers  of  fully  mission  capable  systems  are available to meet operational commitments. 4.3.3.  Wing-level  and  below  unit  commanders  will  report  readiness  in  the  Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) in accordance with AFI 10-201. (T-0). 4.3.3.1.  COMBAT  SHIELD  will  be  the  lead  AF  EWAP  and  will  be  responsible  for coordinating  with  all  MAJCOM-specific  EWAP  programs.    The  COMBAT  SHIELD program  will  be  prepared  to  support  all  MAJCOMs  by  offering  airframe-specific  EW readiness assessments as required by ACC. 4.3.3.2.  Fighter and bomber aircraft unit commanders will conduct EW system readiness assessments  using  the  COMBAT  SHIELD  program.  Other  aircraft  types  should  model 22 AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 their readiness assessments after the COMBAT SHIELD example whenever possible. (T-2) 4.3.3.3.  Visiting assessment teams, similar to those used by COMBAT SHIELD, should be used to the maximum extent possible. 4.3.4.  Units  should  take  advantage  of  all  opportunities  to  exercise  their  respective  systems and support equipment to determine operational status. 4.3.5.  IG  programs  will  evaluate  and  report  the  readiness  of  unit  EW  systems,  associated maintenance equipment, and associated training devices. AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 23 Chapter 5 LEADERSHIP & EDUCATION 5.1.  EW Strategy.  The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) provides the strategic vision for EW. This is articulated in the USAF EW Roadmap/EW Vision 2030 (EV2030) as a robust suite of capabilities to enable control of the EMS to assure freedom of operation and primary effects in and  through  all  domains  which  include  air,  space,  cyberspace,  land  and  maritime.  The  EW Roadmap is delineated into three phases: Near-term, Mid-term and Far-term. For each phase, the roadmap specifies actionable steps organized by DOTMLPF. These actionable steps deliberately map  to  desired  end  states  in  four  distinct  EW  capability  areas:  Airborne  Electronic  Attack (AEA), Self-Protection (survivability), DE and EW Battle Management/Support, all of which are derived from the Joint Capability Areas (JCAs) and Air Force Core Functions. 5.2.  Air  Force  EV2030  Report  Card.  AF/A5R,  via  the  EW  SAG,  will  provide  an  annual “Report  Card”  to  AF/A5/8  assessing  progress  against  each  EV2030  milestone.  HAF  is responsible for updating this document and coordinating those changes with the MAJCOMs. 5.3.  EW  Advisory  Group  (EWAG).  This  the  Air  Force  corporate  body  for  facilitating effective integrated management of AF EW across DOTMLPF.  It is responsible with ensuring the  most  effective  and  efficient  utilization  of  materiel  capabilities,  including  requirements refinement  and  endorsement,  technology  and  system  development,  procurement  and  fielding, sustainment/upgrading, and eventual retirement (AF EWAG Charter, Oct 2010). 5.3.1.  EW  Senior  Advisory  Group  (EW  SAG).  Membership  in  this  organization,  which  is co-chaired  by  HQ  AFMC/A2/5  and  AF/A5R,  is  comprised  of  General  Officer/SES stakeholders  from  the  HAF,  ARC  and  MAJCOMs.    The  EW  SAG  shall  meet  at  least annually  in  order  to  support  the  PPBE  process.    It  sets  the  objectives  and  provides recommendations to the SECAF and CSAF. 5.3.2.  EW  Technical  Advisory  Group  (EW  TAG).  Co-chaired  by  AFLCMC/XZI  and AF/A5RE, the EW TAG shall meet  at  least  semi-annually and serves as the focal  point for coordination  and  collaboration  for  achieving  EWAG  objectives,  provides  direction  and oversight  to  any  EW  integrated  product  teams  (IPT),  and  makes  recommendations  to  the SAG.  Membership consists of senior representatives at the O-6 level or civilian equivalents from the HAF, ARC, MAJCOMs, and other vested organizations (i.e., NSA, Sister Services, J-39, etc.).  Leadership from the AF Reprogramming Centers (AFI 10-703) are key members of this group. 5.4.  Electronic Warfare  (EW)  Test  and  Evaluation  (T&E)  Consortium.  The AF EW T&E Consortium works Test and Evaluation efforts through the AF EWAG and AF/TE.  Chaired by AF/TE, the AF EW T&E Consortium membership consists of senior representatives at the O-6 level  or  civilian  equivalents  from  the  MAJCOMs  and  test  organizations  with  an  interest  in  the test and evaluation of EW systems.  The EW T&E Consortium is the AF agent for coordinating EW  T&E  activities  including  1)  recommending  lead  test  organizations,  2)  prioritizing  test facility  use  and  modernization,  3)  standardizing  test  practices,  and  4)  reducing  duplication  and increasing efficiencies and effectiveness. 24 AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 Chapter 6 PERSONNEL 6.1.  Expertise  and  Readiness.  This  chapter  provides  guidance  concerning  specialized manning,  readiness,  proficiency  and  expertise  to  increase  the  Air  Force’s  ability  to  maximize each component of EW operations. 6.1.1.  Air  Force  EW  personnel  must  be  ready  to  operate  at  the  strategic,  operational,  and tactical levels of warfare.  Maintaining a professional fighting force requires personnel with in-depth  knowledge  of  their  EW  specialty  and  an  awareness  of  other  IRCs.    Career progression  should  facilitate  development  of  this  expertise  and  familiarization  of  these disciplines within individual career paths.  This knowledge and experience will be tracked so personnel are readily identifiable for additional training opportunities or assignments. 6.1.2.  The primary method for identifying and tracking rated EW expertise (Air Force wide) is  the  Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC).    Individuals  not  in  possession  of  an  Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) AFSC but having critical EW expertise will be distinguished via an “E” prefix to  their primary  AFSC.  To  ensure adequate  expertise is  available the following tasks will be accomplished: 6.1.2.1.  Air  Force  MAJCOM  A3  (operations)  divisions  will  identify  which  non-EWO AFSC  officer  positions  require  specialized  EW  knowledge  and  experience  to  their  A1 (manpower)  counterparts.    These  positions  include  but  are  not  limited  to  pilots, navigators,  and  operators  (cyberwarfare  and  space  control  expertise),  along  with  EW-related platform maintenance, intelligence, engineering, and acquisitions personnel. 6.1.2.2.  The  HAF  Director  of  Operations  (AF/A3O)  has  oversight  for  “E  prefix” management including recruiting, training, assignments, and career development studies or  reports.    Contact  your  local  manpower  office  to  obtain  details  on  the  current  Unit Manning Document (UMD) with “E” prefixes attached to MAJCOM authorized AFSCs. 6.1.3.  Commands  will  manage  their  respective  EW  force  structure  to  ensure  their organizations have available resources for all documented UMD positions. 6.1.4.  Personnel readiness demands that properly trained and qualified individuals are placed where  they  are  most  needed.  Commands  utilizing  Special  Experience  Identifiers  to  fill IO/IRC  career  force  billets  will  also  ensure  their  EW  experts  are  easily  identifiable  and distinct  from  those  with  Offensive  Cyber  Operations,  Space  Operations  or  Military Information  Support  Operations  proficiency  in  order  to  meet  Air  Force  operational  tasks IAW AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning: Air & Space Expeditionary Force. 6.2.  MAJCOMs  will  :  Assess (operations, maintenance/logistics, intelligence, and associated support staffs) and forward this information to AF/A3O for follow-on action.  In turn, HAF directorates will do the following: their  EW  manpower requirements 6.2.1.  AF/A3O  will  assess  authorized  billets  against  MAJCOM  requirements  and  fill positions requiring EW expertise. 6.2.2.  AF/A1M will determine the number of authorizations earned, correct grades and skill levels based on man-hour and work load factors. AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 25 Chapter 7 FACILITIES 7.1.  Types  of  Facilities.  EW  operators,  maintainers,  engineers  and  analysts  require  different types  of  facilities  to  provide  operational  EW  capability  to  the  warfighter.  Facilities  including laboratories  for  development  and  sustainment,  installed  systems  test  facilities,  test  &  training ranges and associated instrumentation are needed to test, train and prepare for combat operations. 7.1.1.  EW laboratories, ranges, and associated instrumentation support the EW development, demonstration,  T&E  and  sustainment  efforts  needed  to  successfully  operate  in  a  congested and  contested  EMOE.    These  EW  facilities  maintain  the  ability  to  generate  up-to-date red/gray/blue/white signals in order to accurately simulate the congested and contested EME of anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) environments.  They include: 7.1.1.1.  Anechoic  RF  Test  Facilities:  The  Air  Force  Test  Center  (AFTC)  operates anechoic  RF  facilities  with  a  broad  range  of  capabilities.  They  support  the  research, developmental  and  operational  test  communities,  industry  and  U.S  allied  foreign militaries  (partner  nations)  in  the  execution  of  EW  and  other  RF  test  requirements.  Anechoic  facilities  are  used  to  absorb  RF  energy  to  reduce  the  electromagnetic reflections.  This, in turn, simulates free-space (airborne) environments within acceptable limitations  based  on  frequency  and  the  size  of  the  facility  and  the  test  article  (system-under-test).  The quiet RF environment allows for MIL-STD electromagnetic interference and  compatibility  (EMI/C)  testing  on  various  EW  systems  and  other  avionics.  Additionally,  anechoic  facilities  allow  testing  in  a  highly  secure  and  controlled environment. 7.1.2.  The  Benefield  Anechoic  Facility  (BAF)  at  Edwards  AFB  supports  installed  systems testing  for  avionics  test  programs  requiring  a  large,  shielded  chamber  with  RF  absorption capability that simulates free space.  The BAF provides the capability to: 7.1.2.1.  Investigate  and  evaluate  anomalies  associated  with  EW  systems,  avionics, tactical missiles and their host platforms. 7.1.2.2.  Accommodate  tactical-sized,  (single  or  multiple),  or  large  vehicles  that  can  be operated in  a controlled  EME with  emitters on and sensors stimulated while RF signals are recorded and analyzed. 7.1.2.3.  Generate  RF  signals  with  a  wide  variety  of  characteristics,  simulating red/gray/blue/white surface-based, sea-based, and airborne systems. 7.1.2.4.  Produce  combination  of  signals  and  control  functions  emulating  a  wide  variety of test conditions. 7.1.2.5.  Generate conditions that are not available on outdoor ranges from the aspect of signal density, pulse density and number of simultaneous types. 7.1.2.6.  Have the  capabilities  for  real-time  and  post-test  RF  signal  parameter measurement, instrument display recording, data analysis and test coordination, as well as providing the data for signal verification 26 AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 7.1.3.  The  Joint  Preflight  Integration  of  Munitions  and  Electronic  Systems  (J-PRIMES) facility at Eglin AFB provides an environment to facilitate testing air-to-air and air-to-surface munitions and electronics systems on fighter-sized aircraft and land vehicles prior to open air testing.  Jointly the J-PRIMES and the BAF facilities will provide complementary anechoic chamber capabilities to effectively test and field  RF-centric systems  and other avionics that must operate in a dense or high power electromagnetic environment.  AFTC will work with program  offices  to  determine  which  combination  of  anechoic  chamber  test  capabilities  can best  support  test  requirements  based  on  technical  requirements,  location,  and  schedule availability. 7.1.4.  The  Electronic  Warfare  Aviation  Integration  Support  Facility  (EWAISF)  at  Robins AFB,  Georgia  and  mission  data  (MD)  development  labs  at  Eglin  AFB,  Florida  and  Robins AFB are equipped and maintained to support the reprogramming process IAW AFI 10-703. 7.1.5.  The Digital  Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) Mission  Simulation  Laboratory (MSL)  will  provide  a  verified  and  validated  mission-level  simulation  of  integrated  air defense systems.  It provides the ability to model/test the effects of a variety of EW systems on the IADS, from end to end, within an operationally representative scenario not available elsewhere  in  size  and  density.    Its  strength  lies  in  the  ability  to  accurately  model  the  air picture development to make it a relevant tool for providing answers for both the tester and the trainer for system and tactics effectiveness. 7.1.6.  The Multi-Spectral  Test  &  Training Environment (MSTTE) will provide a multi-use threat  EW  capability  supporting  open-air  and  component-in-the-loop  (CITL)  testing  and training  on  the  Eglin  Test  and  Training  Complex  (ETTC).    MSTTE  consists  of  a  suite  of fully instrumented threat air defense systems operated across the Eglin ranges.  There are 13 primary threats that support multiple programs.  A few additional systems are dedicated for and funded by specific customers.  The primary purpose of the MSTTE systems is to support open-air  testing.    The  systems  are  also  available  to  provide  EW  training  for  aircrews.  MSTTE also provided the capability to support open-air CITL testing using a tower complex, the Electronic Systems Test Facility (ESTF).  This enables testing/developing EW algorithms and techniques.  The location of the MSTTE assets provides a unique synergism with other test capabilities on Eglin, creating an integrated precision measurement capability. 7.1.7.  Hardware-in-the-loop  (HITL)  facilities  include  the  Guided  Weapons  Evaluation Facility  (GWEF)  at  Eglin  AFB.    The  GWEF  will  support  testing  of  domestic  munitions systems  and  in  its  EW  role,  will  provide  infrared  countermeasure  (IRCM)  HITL  testing  to evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  countermeasure  systems  to  defeat  electro-optical  and  infrared threat  missiles.   In order to  provide effectiveness evaluations,  the GWEF will maintain and operate  validated  HITL  simulations  employing  actual  threats  against  simulated  targets emitting  in  the  optical  band  of  the  threat  missile.    These  simulations  allow  thousands  of simulated  engagements  under  varying  aircraft  operating  conditions  to  determine  if  flares, directed  energy,  or  laser  countermeasures  are  effective  in  defeating  threat  missile  guidance systems. 7.2.  Test & Training Ranges.  The Air Force test and training range infrastructure: 7.2.1.  Provides  open-air  operation  in  support  of  air-to-air  and  air-to-ground  weapons DT/OT&E for DoD, non-DoD and commercial customers. AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 27 7.2.2.  Includes  mission  scheduling,  test  &  training  resources,  test  operations,  and  test analysis  in  support  of  weapons  and  command,  control,  communications,  computers,  and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) test programs. 7.2.3.  Supports MAJCOM EW investment and modernization efforts. 7.3.  MAJCOM Responsibilities.  MAJCOMs will: 7.3.1.  Acquire, maintain and sufficiently fund T&E facilities such as Integrated System Test Facilities  (ISTF),  like  those  at  Arnold,  Edwards  and  Eglin  Air  Force  Bases  and  mission simulation  laboratories  at  Arnold,  Edwards,  Eglin,  Holloman  and  Kirtland  Air  Force  Bases which  provide  key  T&E  capabilities  to  ensure  EW  programs  meet  validated  operational requirements.  Conducting EW testing in  these facilities enables the identification of issues prior to open air testing, and reduces the expensive and time-consuming “fly-fix-fly” process.  These facilities support: 7.3.1.1.  EW range test and training operations. 7.3.1.2.  Anechoic radio frequency test facilities for antenna tests, installed systems tests, and RF interoperability/compatibility tests. 7.3.1.3.  Building and maintaining live-virtual-constructive (L-V-C) EW operations. 7.3.1.4.  Operation  of  HITL  capabilities  to  support  evaluation  of  aircraft  self-protection systems  against  ground  and  airborne  threat  missile  systems,  ISR  systems,  and  radar systems.  An example of this capability exists at Edwards AFB in the Integrated Facility for Avionics Systems Test (IFAST). 7.3.1.5.  Operation of HITL capabilities to support evaluation of guidance, navigation and geo-location systems in threat-representative NAVWAR environments such as the 746th Test Squadron’s Navigation Test and Evaluation Laboratory (NavTEL). 7.3.2.  Ensure  a  T&E  process  is  incorporated  into  each  acquisition  program’s  Test  and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), which documents the overall structure and objectives of the T&E  program.    The  objective  is  to  identify  overall  T&E  activities  to  be  performed  by  the government and system contractors.  This will guide the development of specific test events and  direct  the  integration  and  utilization  of  AF  ground  test  facilities  into  these  events. MAJCOMs  will  ensure  the  TEMP  documents  the  T&E  schedule  and  test  resource requirements.    All  Air  Force  EW  test  activities  will  utilize  AF  test  facilities  for  applicable tests if possible.  If an EW ground test requirement cannot be met with the use of an existing AF ground test facility, it will be documented in the TEMP T&E schedule and will require a waiver from AF/TE.  BURTON M.

Cyberspace—A  global  domain  within  the  information  environment  consisting  of  the interdependent  network  of  information  technology  infrastructures,  including  the  Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers. Electromagnetic  pulse (EMP)—Is the generation and radiation in a transmission medium of a very narrow and very high-amplitude pulse of electromagnetic noise. The term is associated with the high-level pulse because of a nuclear detonation and with an intentionally generated narrow, high-amplitude pulse for EA applications.  In nuclear detonations, the EMP signal consists of a continuous spectrum with most of its energy distributed throughout the low frequency band of 3 to 30 kHz. Electronic Warfare (EW)—Any military action involving the use of electromagnetic (EM) and directed  energy  (DE)  to  control  the  EM  spectrum  or  to  attack  the  enemy.  The  three  major subdivisions  within  EW  are:  electronic  attack  (EA),  electronic  protection  (EP),  and  electronic warfare support (ES). 34 AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 Electronic  Warfare  Coordination  Authority  (EWCA)—The  Joint  Force  Commander  (JFC) designee for the coordination of all Electronic Warfare activities within the theater of operations. Electronic Warfare Coordination Cell (EWCC)—A specialized portion of the Air Operations Center  (AOC)  dedicated  to  achieving  a  commander’s  EW  related  objectives  for  the electromagnetic spectrum. Electronic  Warfare  Integrated  Reprogramming  (EWIR)—A  systematic  process  for operational commanders to respond to a dynamic threat environment.  It gives all Air Force units a  timely  and  accurate  means  to  respond  to  expected  and  unexpected  electronic  emissions, changes  in  air  defense  tactics,  and  unique  mission  requirements.    These  EWIR  responsibilities include  procedures  for  changes  in  tactics,  employment  guidance,  electronic  warfare  (EW) equipment  (software/hardware),  aircrew  training  and  training  devices  (i.e.  threat  simulators, threat emitters) and other support systems. Information  Operations—“The integrated  employment,  during  military  operations,  of information-related  capabilities  in  concert  with  other  lines  of  operation    to  influence,  disrupt, corrupt or usurp the decision-making of potential adversaries while protecting our own.” (JP 1-02) Information operations (IO) are the integrated employment of the capabilities of influence operations, electronic warfare operations, and network warfare operations, in concert with specified integrated control enablers, to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own. (AFDD 3-13) (Italicized definition applies only to the Air Force) Interoperability—The ability of systems, units or forces to provide data, information, materiel, and  Services  to  and  accept  the  same  from  other  systems,  units  or  forces  and  to  use  the  data, information, materiel and Services so exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together.  NSS and ITS interoperability include both the technical exchange of information and the end-to-end  operational  effectiveness  of information  as  required  for  mission accomplishment. that  exchanged Joint  Capabilities  Integration  and  Development  System  (JCIDS)—A Joint concepts-centric process  that  supports  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  and  the  JROC  in  identifying,  assessing,  and prioritizing  joint  military  capability  needs  and  identifying  integrated  DOTMLPF  solutions (materiel  and  non-materiel)  to  fill  those  needs  within  the  DoD  CBP  process.    Additionally, JCIDS  is  a  key  element  in  the  Chairman's  effort  to  realize  the  initiatives  directed  in  the Transformation Planning Guidance. Materiel  Solution—A  defense  acquisition  program  (non-developmental,  modification  of existing systems, or new program) that satisfies identified operator capabilities. Network  Operations  (NetOps)—The  integrated  planning  and  employment  of  military capabilities to provide the friendly net environment needed to plan, control and execute military operations and conduct Service functions. NetOps provides operational planning and control.  It involves  time-critical,  operational-level  decisions  that  direct  configuration  changes  and information routing.  NetOps risk management and command and control decisions are based on a  fused  assessment  of  intelligence,  ongoing  operations,  commander’s  intent,  blue  and  gray situation,  net  health,  and  net  security.    NetOps  provides  the  three  operational  elements  of AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 35 information  assurance,  network/system  management,  and management.  Also called NetOps. information  dissemination Offensive  Cyberspace  Operations—Cyberspace  operations  intended  to  project  power  by  the application of force in or through cyberspace. Also called OCO. Operational  Test  and  Evaluation  (OT&E)—Testing  and  evaluation  conducted  in  as  realistic an  operational  environment  as  possible  to  estimate  the  prospective  system’s  operational effectiveness  and  operational  suitability.  In  addition,  OT&E  provides information  on organization, personnel requirements, doctrine, and tactics.  Within the Air Force, the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC), conducts OT&E. Proficiency—Estimate used during capability analysis that answers the question “How well do we perform a given task (miles, minutes, percent, etc.)?”  Together, proficiency and sufficiency ratings will be used to determine overall health and risk of a capability to achieve an effect. RAMPOD—Operational  R&M  Assessment  System  supports  all  facets  of  maintaining,  testing, integrating,  and  evaluating  changes  to  field  data  collection  software  programs  (RCS).    These programs currently support the ALQ-131/184/188 EA Pods, ALE-40/45/47 chaff/flare systems. Spectrum  Management—Involves  planning,  coordinating,  and  managing  use  of  the  EM spectrum  through  operational,  engineering,  and  administrative  procedures.    Its  objective  is  to enable electronic systems to perform their functions in the intended environment without causing or suffering unacceptable interference. Sponsor—Domain  owner  responsible  for  all  common  documentation,  periodic  reporting,  and funding actions required for supporting the capabilities, development, and acquisition process for a specific capability proposal. Sufficiency—Estimate  used  during  capability  analysis  that  answers  the  question  “Do  we  have enough  (troops,  aircraft,  supplies,  etc.)?”   Together,  sufficiency  and  proficiency  ratings  will  be used to determine overall health and risk of a capability to achieve an effect. User—An  operational  command  or  agency  that  receives  or  will  receive  benefit  from  the acquired system.  Combatant Commanders and their Service component commands are the users.  There may be more than one user for a system.  Because the Service component commands are required  to  organize,  equip,  and  train  forces  for  the  Combatant  Commanders,  they  are  seen  as users of systems.  The Chiefs of the Services and heads of other DOD components are validation and approval authorities and are not viewed as users.  36 AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 Attachment 2 USAF EW SUPPORT TO JOINT TASK FORCES A2.1.  This attachment provides  : Service guidelines to commanders concerning Air Force EW during contingency operations.  As always, JCS guidance takes precedence over the information provided in this attachment. IRAQI  FREEDOM A2.2.  Operations and  ENDURING  FREEDOM (OEF):  Demonstrated  why  the  Air  Force  needs  a  fully  trained  core  of  EWCC  experts  to coordinate  and  execute  operational  EW  activities  to  meet  Joint  Force  Commander  (JFC) objectives. (OIF) A2.2.1.  The EWCC will work closely with the Joint Force Commander’s Electronic Warfare Staff  (JCEWS)  or  component  equivalents  (as  designated  by  the  lead  service)  to  provide SMEs on USAF EW capabilities. A2.2.2.  It  will  coordinate  as  appropriate  with  the  CAOC  plans/operations  divisions,  IO, Space,  Intel,  Battlefield  Coordination Detachment  (BCD), J-6, or other cells as required by its assigned JFC function(s). A2.3.  Air Force EWCC manning will be fully integrated. A2.3.1.  The  Chief  of  the  EWCC  will  be  a  senior  Air  Force  EWO  and  designated  by  the appropriate component commander.  This designated individual will be the CAOC EW focal point  to  ensure  proper  coordination  within  the  IO  Cell  and  other  Specialty  Teams.    As  a minimum,  the  Chief  will  be  cleared  and  briefed  into  Special  Technical  Operations  (STO); and strong consideration should be given to COAL WARFIGHTER (CW) in-brief.  All other EWCC personnel will be cleared to TS/SCI. A2.3.2.  Manning  levels  must  be  commensurate  with  the  scale  of  EW  operations  being conducted.  In order to function correctly, liaison links must be established with supporting commands  as  well  as  EW  specialists  from  correlating  capabilities  and  other  employed  EW elements. A2.3.3.  The  EWCC  will  be  the  Air  Force’s  primary  agency  for  the  deconfliction  of intentional  EM  emissions  across  Services  and  other  Coalition  partners  participating  in  the Joint Operational Construct. A2.3.4.  Inside  the  War  Fighting  HQ  (WFHQ),  the  EWCC  will  provide  critical  Air  Force SMEs on the following items.   AFI10-706  14 MAY 2014 37 Figure A2.1.  EWCC Provide Critical Air Force SMEs on the following items Deliberate/Crisis Action Planning CONPLAN/OPLAN TET/Strategy - Air Operations Directive (AOD) Master Air Attack Plan (MAAP) - Air Tasking Order (ATO) EW Spins - Rules of Engagement (ROE) Joint Restricted Frequency List (JRFL) Jamming Control Authority (JCA) EWBM Activities as directed by the JFC Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming (EWIR) in respective AORs  A2.4.  The  Air  Force  EWCC  :  can  be  called  upon  to  act  as  the  joint  force  commander’s mechanism  for  coordinating  and  executing  EW  operations  within  a  theatre  of  operations including  those  involving  a  Combined  Joint  Task  Force  (CJTF).    Responsibilities  include  EW planning,  coordination/monitoring,  source  of  advice,  line-of-fire  deconfliction,  as  well  as  the traditional  EA  activities  normally  reserved  for  offensive  air  operations  and  defensive  activities associated with the FP mission. A2.5.  In  order  to  synchronize  combat  operations  :  Constant  liaison  with  the  ground maneuver,  intelligence,  and  communications  staffs/elements  is  essential  for  the  EM  spectrum environment. A2.5.1.  The EWCC must be located in a secure area for the handling and storage of sensitive intelligence  material,  within  close  proximity  to  component  IO  Staff,  Operations,  Space, Intelligence (MASINT/SIGINT) and Communications Interface Shelter (CIS) staff cells. A2.5.2.  Elements of the EWCC must be an integral part of a NAF headquarters/Component Staff  during  peacetime  to  enable  OPLAN  development,  exercise  planning  and  conducting effective EW training. A2.6.  All  operational  analyses  revealing  EW  gaps,  shortfalls,  and  benchmark  best practices  will  be:  Documented  as  lessons  learned  and  will  be  incorporated  into  the  Air  Force Advanced  Lessons  Management  System located  at http://www.a9.hq.smil.mil/a9l/, no later than 48 hours after observation occurrence.
