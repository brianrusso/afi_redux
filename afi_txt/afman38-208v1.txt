Philosophy. The Manpower and Organization (M&O) function has four core competencies: (1)Requirements Determination, (2) Program Allocation and Control, (3) Organizational Structure, and (4)Performance Management. These four competencies form the basis for all M&O activities. Specificsregarding the core competencies can be found in their applicable Air Force Instructions (AFIs) as refer-enced below. 1.1.1.  Requirements Determination. M&O personnel assist Air Force commanders and functionalmanagers at all levels in mission accomplishment by objectively quantifying manpower requirementsfor the distribution of Air Force manpower resources. Key services of this competency include peace-time manpower standards development, wartime manpower requirements, and competitive sourcingand privatization actions. Integral in any manpower requirements determination effort is a review of afunction’s processes with the goal of making process improvements as described in Chapter 3. Addi-tional concepts and performance guidance regarding this competency are provided in AFI 38-203,Commercial Activities Program, and AFI 38-205, Manpower and Quality Readiness and ContingencyManagement. Roles and responsibilities are outlined in AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Require-ments. 1.1.2.  Manpower Program Allocation and Control. Concepts and performance guidance are providedin AFI 38-201; AFI 38-202, Air Force Management Headquarters and Headquarters Support Activi-ties; and AFI 38-204, Programming USAF Manpower. 1.1.3.  Organizational Structure. Concepts and performance guidance are provided in AFPD 38-1, Organization, and AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. 1.1.4.  Performance Management. Concepts and performance guidance are provided in AFI 90-1102,Performance Management. This competency uses various tools and techniques found in AFMAN38-208, Volume 1, Air Force Management Engineering Program (MEP ) - Processes; AFMAN38-208 Volume 2, Air Force Management Engineering Program (MEP) - Quantification Tools; andAFI 90-553, Standardizing Action Workout Improvements. 1.2.  Purpose of the Management Engineering Program (MEP). The Air Force MEP provides thefoundation for executing all M&O core competencies and helps Air Force commanders and functionalmanagers improve productivity through the use of performance improvement techniques and procedures.The MEP provides the framework for developing Air Force Manpower Standards (AFMSs), com-mand-unique manpower standards, and providing products and services. 1.2.1.  Team Approach. MEP and functional personnel build cohesive teams to reach study objectivesand achieve productivity improvement goals. Formal study contracts outline specific study objectivesand responsibilities for all team members to work together to meet those objectives. 1.2.2.  MEP Methodology. MEP methodology is built on state-of-the-art performance improvementtechniques. 1.2.2.1.  Performance improvement takes a systematic look at an organization to identify pro-cesses for potential improvement. Outcomes, outputs (products and services), processes, capitalequipment, facility layout, customers, and suppliers are identified as part of a process improve-AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20027ment analysis. The project team collects data to analyze and improve these processes to meetfuture requirements. Tools and techniques described in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, are used asappropriate for the study. 1.2.2.2.  The Seven-Phase Approach to Requirements Determination studies as described in Sec-tion 3B-Section 3G of this volume may be applicable for use in all four core competency contextswhere improvement in performance is desired. 1.2.3.  MEP Organization. 1.2.3.1.  HQ USAF/XP gives program direction through related policy. The Air Force Manpowerand Innovation Agency (AFMIA) develops tools and techniques to carry out policy and furnishesMEP customer-related technical support. 1.2.3.2.  M&Os at all levels will implement the MEP. 1.3.  Scheduling Policy.  1.3.1.  Air Force and major command (MAJCOM) offices of primary responsibility (OPR) will con-tinually evaluate their functions to determine the need to update a study. This includes processchanges, opportunities for process improvement, organization and mission changes, as well as indica-tors from Air Force management information systems. 1.3.2.  HQ USAF/XP approves all Air Force-level process oriented review exemptions. 1.3.3.  M&O and functional personnel will partner with the appropriate OPR to accomplish perfor-mance improvement projects. 1.3.4.  MAJCOMs perform improvement projects for MAJCOM-unique functions. 1.3.5.  Air Staff functional managers, in partnership with AFMIA, will brief the Air Force CorporateStructure on the results of their zero-based reviews to include prioritization of their workloads andoptions for sourcing any unfunded requirement. MAJCOMs will use their own corporate structuresfor their command-unique areas. 1.3.6.  Air Force will retain any savings from the Air Force-wide reviews to source new AirForce-wide initiatives as determined through the Air Force Corporate Structure. MAJCOMs willretain all savings from their command-unique reviews to use as the MAJCOM Corporate Structuredeems necessary. 1.3.7.  AFMIA will publish all resultant active duty Air Force and MAJCOM-unique manpower stan-dards. Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command will continue to publish reserve manpower stan-dards. Reference this volume for publishing guidelines. 1.4.  Documentation Requirements. This publication contains examples and formats of various docu-mentation requirements. These are referenced in the applicable section. 8AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Chapter 2  INTRODUCTION TO CONSULTANT SERVICES 2.1.  Purpose of Consultant Services. The MEP offers consultant services to unit commanders at all lev-els of command and to functional managers at headquarters level. Commanders and functional managersmay request consultant services to help solve an existing or potential problem or get general informationor advice about manpower management issues. 2.2.  Definition of Consultant Services. Consultant services direct manpower and management engi-neering expertise toward problem resolution, effective resource usage, or mission performance improve-ments. These services may include brief consultation with management, or a more in-depth consultationrequiring a study contract and report. Unit commanders at all levels of command and functional managersat headquarters level may request consultant services. For description of possible tools and techniquesthat could be used for a study, reference AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2. 2.3.  Consultant Services Requirements.  2.3.1.  Consultant Requirements. There are no specific requirements for brief consultations. However,for in-depth studies, the following requirements apply: 2.3.1.1.  The Management Engineer (ME) consultant and client form a study partnership. Theycooperate in all special study activities to include study planning, data collection, analysis, andimplementation. 2.3.1.2.  The client has final authority to accept or reject the completed study recommendations. 2.3.1.3.  The ME helps the client with the implementation of recommendations and conducts fol-low-up visits to help evaluate results. 2.3.1.4.  The ME is responsible for study confidentiality and may only release study results anddocuments with the client's permission. 2.3.1.5.  The ME must evaluate study feasibility before agreeing to study the function. Considerthe following when evaluating feasibility: 2.3.1.5.1.  Does the client need assistance to complete the management engineering project? Can the study goals and objectives be modified to still aid in process improvement? 2.3.1.5.2.  Can a one-time, economical, and relatively short-term analysis solve a problem? Isan objective, impartial viewpoint needed to give a fresh approach to a difficult problem? 2.3.1.5.3.  Has the client tried but cannot define or solve the problem? 2.3.1.5.4.  The ME consultant and client coordinate with the installation labor relations officialregarding requirements of local collective bargaining agreements when any members repre-sented by a union may be impacted by the consulting process or by recommendations of thestudy. 2.3.1.6.  DON'T do a study if the MEP consultant believes the sole purpose is to: 2.3.1.6.1.  Justify predetermined manpower increases or decreases. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200292.3.1.6.2.  Expect the consultant to make a line management decision for the client. 2.3.2.  Documentation Requirements. Consultant service products objectively state analysis resultsand help the commander, manager, or supervisor decide alternative courses of action. 2.3.2.1.  Formal reports are not required for brief consultations. Exercise customer-oriented judg-ment to decide the effort and detail required to satisfy the client's needs. 2.3.2.2.  An in-depth, formal study may have three written parts: 2.3.2.2.1.  Consultant Study Contract (Figure 2.1.). This written agreement constitutes a studycontract between the MEP consultant and the client. This contract forms the basis for mutualresponsibilities and potential follow-on study activities. 2.3.2.2.2.  Consultant Study Final Report (Figure 2.2.). The MEP consultant documents studyfindings in the study final report. 2.3.2.2.3.  Consultant Study Abstract (Figure 2.3.). When approved for distribution by the cli-ent, the primary purpose of the study abstract is crosstell (internal benchmarking). Its use isbased on the potential applicability of identified improvements to other similar sites or func-tions. Consider study abstract crosstell to MAJCOM M&Os and functional counterparts, MEPadministrators, and other pertinent Air Force organizations. If the MEP consultant and clientdecide there’s no applicable potential for other sites or functions, or if the outcome of the spe-cial study was converted to an approved manpower standard or variance (see paragraph 3.27.),the study abstract isn’t required. 10AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Figure 2.1.

The ultimate goal of organizational performance is mission accomplishment.Resource requirements reflected in a manpower standard should be based on an organization and processdesigns which most effectively and efficiently accomplishes the mission. Improving mission effective-ness while maintaining or improving efficiency should be the goal of any modification to a function’s cur-rent organizational or process design. Efficiency does not necessarily mean decreasing resources, butrather improving the return on the resources used. 3.2.  Contexts for Using the Seven-Phase Approach. The approach described below is useful in anycontext for process improvement. It ensures that an organization is designed effectively and efficientlybefore building a manpower standard. For example, the Assessment step in AFI 90-1102 may identifythat an organization is not meeting performance standards. Using the Seven-Phase Approach is a methodan organization can use to identify and improve problem areas and processes that can be incorporated intothe planning portion of the performance management cycle, outlined in AFI 90-1102. 3.3.  Seven-Phase Performance Improvement Approach.  Improving performance requires both plan-ning and execution. The Seven-Phase Approach is a guideline designed to be flexible and adaptable toorganizational needs and study scope and not meant to be a restrictive and inflexible checklist. Theapproach provides the structure to increase the chance of successful implementation of process improve-ments. The phases represent fundamental elements to address no matter what scope the performanceimprovement effort takes. It should be used as a guide, tailored to fit the scope and intent of the project athand. Various tools and techniques to assist in these improvement efforts are listed in AFMAN 38-208,Volume 2, which may be modified as appropriate for the project requirements. Volume 2 is not all inclu-sive of the available improvement tools a ME may use. 3.3.1.  The “Five Fronts” to Consider. For organizational change efforts to be effective, they generallymust include some redesign and/or coordination on five “Fronts” (see Figure 3.1.). These are organi-zational areas that interrelate and should be considered. The figure shown illustrates these Fronts. Achange in one Front may require actions or changes in another Front. For example, changing a processmay also require some training or retraining (People Front); the process improvement may affect howtechnology is used (Technology Front); or the process design may require updates to regulations (Pol-icy, Legislation, Regulation Front). 14AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Figure 3.1.  The Five Fronts. 3.3.1.1.  Organization/People. The human resource asset is the key element for the future viabilityand growth of the organization in a continuously learning environment. As processes are rede-signed or other changes are made, a focus should remain on the worker who must be enabled withappropriate knowledge, skills, experiences and tools, empowered to learn and act, and rewardedbased on the organization’s values and measures. 3.3.1.2.  Technology. This crucial enabling factor allows compression of cycle/lead time and dis-tance, broader access to information and knowledge assets, and eliminates barriers between cus-tomers and suppliers. 3.3.1.3.  Policies, Legislation and Regulations. Changing existing policies, regulations, and legis-lation may be required for new processes. 3.3.1.4.  Physical Infrastructure. The physical facilities, equipment and tools should be designed tosupport and maximize changes in workflow, information technology, and human resources. 3.3.1.5.  Process. The flow of work and information into, through, and out of the organizationmust be redesigned, overcoming the constraints of traditional functions or boundaries. 3.3.2.  Spectrum of Performance Improvement. Figure 3.2. illustrates scope of possible improvementefforts. Understanding the scope of a project is critical for performing the subsequent project phases. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200215Figure 3.2.  Spectrum of Performance Improvement Scope. Locking on to a specific location on the chart, however, is not as important as understanding the uniqueissues to consider for each phase of a project being performed. The scope may be adjusted as the projectprogresses, requiring new things to be considered and emphasized. 3.3.2.1.  Axes. As the scope of the organization involved (bottom axis) in the improvement effortincreases from simple issues through activities and sub-processes to the entire organization, so toodoes the impact on the organizational mission (left axis). Typically, increased organizationalscope is associated with more data collection and analysis as more processes are involved.Increased mission impact scope (left axis) is associated with the need for more coordination andcommunication since more separate units and levels may be involved. Of course, each project mayhave unique effort, analysis, and coordination requirements, which need to be considered by theproject team. 3.3.2.2.  Continuum Line (Wedge). The range of improvement efforts is reflected by a continuumversus discreet points in order to reduce the tendency to get overly focused on the semantics of one16AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002type of improvement effort over another. For example, “reengineering” is a term which has beenmisused in industry and the government in recent years. Since so many perceptions and inconsis-tent definitions exist for this type of improvement effort, having a separate discreet item labeled“reengineering” only promotes the problem. A continuum allows one to define the project in aflexible manner, based on the desired outcomes, without having to wrestle with confusing orrestrictive labels. 3.3.2.3.  The spectrum is divided into three ranges (micro, mid-level, and macro) to represent theincreasing levels of scope and mission impact for improvement projects. Traditional types ofimprovement efforts such as Action Work Outs, Functional Process Improvements, and Reengi-neering, etc., may fall into one of these ranges, but exceptions to where such efforts fall may exist,based on a project’s requirements. Again, try to avoid labeling a project as one range-type oranother (the range titles are used in this document to simply assist in describing the approach). 3.3.2.4.  The three ranges are described below, and refer to projects that would fall on the contin-uum line. The continuum line is used simply as a central position that aids in describing theapproach. You will notice that typically, the recommended activities for each range will build onone another, from micro to macro. This emphasizes the fact that the fundamental concept of eachphase is important in any project, but the level of effort associated with the activities (communica-tion, coordination, data collection, analysis, etc.) will often increase with scope (represented bythe wedge on the chart). 3.3.2.4.1.  Micro. These efforts often reflect minor tuning of an activity or process. They canbe considered almost “surgical” improvement efforts, focused on a very small organizationalscope. Coordination, communication, and time to accomplish such efforts are typically lowerthan the other ranges. Cost may still be high here, especially if technology changes areinvolved. 3.3.2.4.2.  Mid-level. Typically, more processes are being examined, or the level of detail isincreased. Data gathering and analysis may also be more important, as the impact on the orga-nization becomes more critical. Improvement gains in this type of effort typically have signif-icant impact on the mission, but the scope of the improvement may be restricted to a functionor department. 3.3.2.4.3.  Macro. This represents a more holistic improvement in the organization, oftenfocused on dramatic results. The coordination, communication, and time requirements can besubstantial at this level with a focus on improving processes across functions and typicalboundaries. Because this type of effort results in profound changes in the organization, theneed for leadership commitment and a well-defined and communicated compelling case forchange is paramount in a macro improvement effort. 3.3.2.5.  Case for Change. Across the spectrum of improvement opportunities, a compelling casefor change remains a constant requirement. Considering the human element that exists at all levelsand scopes of the organizations, defining and articulating the case for change is a fundamentalingredient for successful implementation. The message or case for change should convincinglyaddress one or both of the following questions: 3.3.2.5.1.  “What will it get me if I change?” This is a “pull” type of motivation which mustpresent something of interest to the target audience. Change is often a scary and painful pro-AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200217cess, whether it is changing familiar work processes, learning a new software program, or quit-ting smoking. The change will occur and take hold only if the outcome is truly desired. 3.3.2.5.2.  “What will it cost me if I do not change?” This is often referred to as a “burningplatform,” providing a convincing “push” argument that staying the same is not a reasonablealternative. “Warfighters will start dying,” “Our career field will be outsourced or eliminated,”or “You will be fired” are pretty compelling reasons to jump from the platform. Of course, thecase for change needs to appeal to those in the organization impacted by the effort. 3.3.2.5.3.  Having the answers to these questions articulated early on in the process is criticalto obtaining buy in and momentum, no matter what the project. 3.3.2.6.  Increase in Scope. As the scope of the improvement effort progresses from smaller tolarger (on the chart in Figure 3.2.), communication, coordination, level of effort, and often, timeand project costs also increase, as represented by the wedge. 3.3.3.  Seven-Phase Requirements Determination. The seven phases are Project Definition, Planning,As-Is, Opportunity Research, To-Be, Coordination & Approval, and Implementation. Often, severalphases occur simultaneously, and in some cases, in different orders. However, some phases must pre-cede others. For example, Project Definition and Planning must always be in place before Implemen-tation occurs. No matter what the scope of the improvement effort, all seven “phases” will be presentto some degree. Some may happen almost instantaneously, and some phases may be accomplishedconcurrently, but any improvement effort requires each phase to be addressed. 3.3.3.1.  For most functional studies, the focus of the study effort should be in the OpportunityResearch and To-Be phases. This emphasis on the future helps ensure the study, when completed,defines the manpower requirements for the future rather than the past. Although estimating themanpower impact of future process changes may be a challenging endeavor, it is the most criticalpart of the study. Not only is this where change opportunities exist, but it provides a future base-line requirement for the function under study. 3.3.3.2.  Each phase is addressed in more detail in the following sections. Section 3B—Project Definition--Phase 1 3.4.  General Concepts. Secure commitment from the unit commander or functional manager who issponsoring the project. This sponsor should be the one who has the authority to approve changes andshould represent the highest appropriate level in the organization. The project sponsor must be committedand must articulate why the change must occur, who should participate in the change effort, who will beaffected by the change, and what the change is expected to bring about. This phase answers the questions,“What are we changing for?” and “What does success look like?” These answers will clarify the projectobjectives for all involved in the effort. Scope is also defined in this phase, clarifying what will and willnot be included in this study (e.g., joint resources, particular Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC), and tech-nologies, etc.), and the level of mission focus (Air Force-wide, base level, etc.). Based on the understand-ing of the scope, the M&O personnel assisting with the effort can determine the project team compositionnecessary to best help the organization. The project team should conduct familiarization research on theorganization, gather available data early on in this phase, and may conduct familiarization visits to seehow the organization does its job. 18AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.5.  Scope Activity Descriptions.  3.5.1.  Micro. Improvement on a focused portion of a local organization may require project definitionin a very informal manner. For an extreme example, if the project is simply redesigning a three-personcubicle, the sponsor may be on a very low level that can authorize cubicle changes. That person muststill have an idea of why the change is needed and what the objectives of the project are (What shouldimprove if the change works?). The scope will be very narrow, but still needs to be understood andcommunicated. Even for a small effort, an unclear project definition can result in wasted effort, frus-tration, and possibly no improvement. 3.5.2.  Mid-level. The fundamental questions addressed in the micro scale are still pertinent, but iden-tifying the sponsor and clarifying the purpose, scope, and case for change become more challenging.In addition to the sponsor, other stakeholders may need to provide their input into defining the project.Interviews are useful in collecting this information and understanding limitations/risks to the project.Familiarizing sponsors on the Seven-Phase Approach allows them to understand and anticipate theeffort associated with a project as they currently envision it. A case for change may be formally docu-mented to serve as a motivating vehicle for those who will be assigned to work the project. The scopeassociated with a mid-level project may require the M&O consulting team to do some preliminaryfamiliarization research on the process or organization. Understanding the language, resources, andoperations of the organization will prove helpful in facilitating even small groups. Site visits, missiondirectives, current manpower standards, AFIs, Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statements,unit type codes (UTCs), and web sites are valuable sources of initial information. 3.5.3.  Macro. A macro project generally requires the sponsor to be in a senior-level leadership posi-tion (e.g., functional leader). Because this type of project may encompass multiple processes to beimpacted Air Force-wide, sponsor commitment and a compelling case for change become even morecritical. The study team’s role is to have the sponsor articulate the case, vision, and objectives andagree to be a relentless champion for the effort. If several senior leaders (e.g., for a cross-functionalproject) are involved, a workshop may be an approach to capture this information and address anyrisks or concerns. Educating the sponsor(s) on the Seven-Phase Approach is also necessary as a pre-view for the type of effort they are going to sponsor. Due to the large scope and the resourcesinvolved, developing a plan to minimize or address project risks is also a valuable step in this phase.Prior to and following sponsor meeting(s), the M&O team should do familiarization research on theorganization. Section 3C—Project Planning--Phase 2 3.6.  General Concepts.  The extent of the planning will vary by study type, objectives, and functionalcomplexity. Develop a clear and comprehensive road map to guide the accomplishment of the project.Establish a plan for how to progress, milestones that must be reached, deliverables that must be created,and how to communicate critical information. Teams are often formed to perform and review the projectprogress. The key participants of such teams must understand what their roles are and how they will needto participate. 3.7.  Planning Considerations.  AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002193.7.1.  Study Objectives. Base objectives on the client’s needs and then determine the type and extentof the study to accomplish these objectives. The project team (M&O and client participants) mustensure all objectives are realistic and attainable. 3.7.2.  Responsibilities. Define responsibilities of functional and M&O team members. Identify M&Oand functional contact points at higher headquarters that will coordinate on study products and assistin resolving study issues, if required. 3.7.3.  Data Availability and Accessibility. Determine what data is needed. You may need to breakgenerally stated objectives into specific tasks. Identify specific outputs. Determine if the data is avail-able to meet output-related study objectives. Determine data availability and accessibility by review-ing functional publications, discussions with functional experts, previous manpower standards, etc.Data security classification impacts data accessibility. Clearly state in the study contract conditionsgoverning availability of data. 3.8.  Research Methodology. The primary drivers of research methodology are data requirements andcustomer timeliness and accuracy needs. Research methodology impacts study effectiveness and effi-ciency. Following are some research methods and sources. 3.8.1.  Documentation Review. Review appropriate documentation and records to become familiarwith the client organization’s mission, organizational structure, and operating procedures. This infor-mation will be useful in future phases and will allow the consulting team to understand the dialogueand data that may emerge in workshops. In addition, some of the data collected will assist the projectteam in performing manpower calculations when/if appropriate in the project. Ensure functional guid-ance is realistic and consistent with peacetime and wartime scenarios and operational concepts. Somepossible research source examples follow: 3.8.1.1.  Organizational policy and guidance (AFI 38-101) and organization charts. 3.8.1.2.  Web sites/organizational home pages. 3.8.1.3.  Functional publications (local, command or Air Force). 3.8.1.4.  Mission Directive publications (AFPD 10-series). 3.8.1.5.  Strategic plans/performance plans. 3.8.1.6.  Unit Manpower Documents (UMD). 3.8.1.7.  Process Oriented Descriptions (to include resources by process, if available) within appli-cable manpower standards. 3.8.1.8.  Applicable operations and contingency plans. 3.8.1.9.  Reports--MEP studies (productivity reports, cost comparison studies), effectiveness(Staff Assistance) evaluations, etc. 3.8.1.10.  Management inspections. 3.8.1.11.  Chief of Staff Survey results. 3.8.1.12.  On-the-Job training records and other specialty training material. 3.8.1.13.  Position Descriptions. 3.8.1.14.  Management information systems. 20AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.8.1.15.  Facility layout. 3.8.1.16.  Equipment/Technology (systems used, degree of standardization, etc.) listed on the Cus-todial Authorized/Custodial Receipt Listing (CA/CRL)/Automated Data Processing Equipmentaccounts, etc. 3.8.1.17.  Organizational chart 3.8.1.18.  The Organization’s Mission Essential Task List 3.8.1.19.  Unit histories 3.8.1.20.  Applicable USAF technical orders, work center records and inspection checklists 3.8.1.21.  Occupational measurement reports 3.8.1.22.  UTC Manpower Detail and Mission Capability Statement 3.8.1.23.  USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP) 3.8.1.24.  Performance Measures in use 3.8.2.  Personal Interviews. Primary objectives are to collect information on what and how work isdone, workload, operating procedures and to involve work center personnel by asking for their ideas.Interviews can also be used to gather customer requirements and obtain leadership perspectives for thefuture and the project. 3.8.2.1.  Interview Approach. Provide an agenda (time, subject, and material). Keep interviewsinformal but follow the organizational structure by starting with the target audience (work centersupervisor, project sponsor, customer, etc.). Some suggested sources are: 3.8.2.1.1.  Chief enlisted manager and 9-skill level superintendent for broad career field infor-mation and current career field issues; technical familiarity with lower level tasks and proce-dures may not be current. 3.8.2.1.2.  The 7-skill level NCO for the best technical information. 3.8.2.1.3.  The 5-skill level airman or NCO for the best information about how tasks are cur-rently accomplished within shops or offices. 3.8.2.1.4.  The 3-skill level apprentice for labor-intensive work and extra work details. The 3-level can often present an unbiased opinion from the perspective of “fresh eyes”. 3.8.2.2.  Individual vs Group Interviews--Advantages and Disadvantages. 3.8.2.2.1.  Individual interviews take more time but yield more data. Focus questions on a spe-cific individual without having other group members waiting. No individual overshadowsother group members. A potential disadvantage is conflicting information that must be recon-ciled. 3.8.2.2.2.  Group interviews are more effective when time is limited or there is disagreementamong group members. Group interviews normally result in a consensus and help membersrecall additional tasks. Disadvantage: Group think (group follows strongest leader at inter-view.) 3.8.3.  On-Site Observations. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002213.8.3.1.  Consider visiting a cross-section of locations with the functional representative. Attendexercises and deployments. Discuss findings with the functional OPR and verify findings withlocal managers and supervisors. Screen suggestions for potential use. 3.8.3.2.  Use on-site observations to: 3.8.3.2.1.  Identify processes, working relationships, and physical arrangements for improve-ment. 3.8.3.2.2.  Increase understanding of procedures and data obtained. 3.8.3.2.3.  Obtain information on work environment and worker productivity (idleness, workdistribution, team discipline, cleanliness, work layout, excessive standards of living, short sus-penses). 3.8.3.3.  When conducting on-site observations: 3.8.3.3.1.  Look closely at high volume of work. People work harder when watched, orunusual operating conditions may exist. 3.8.3.3.2.  Avoid biases. Do not let general impressions bias facts and findings. 3.8.3.3.3.  Avoid prolonged observations. It disturbs people and reduces their willingness tohelp. 3.8.4.  Questionnaires. A questionnaire is a quick and inexpensive tool to gather information whenthere is not enough time to interview personnel or potential interviewees at other locations. Developquestions as follows: 3.8.4.1.  Determine information needed. 3.8.4.2.  Ask direct, specific questions. Phrase questions so answers are easy, short, and concise.Use preprinted response formats when possible. 3.8.4.3.  Avoid emotional connotations. Do not influence answers with phrasing. 3.8.4.4.  Avoid manpower jargon. Direct the questionnaire to the audience’s ability and knowl-edge. 3.8.4.5.  Place questions in logical sequence for ease of response and analysis. 3.8.4.6.  Avoid asking attitude or opinion questions. If this is necessary, comply with AFI36-2601, Air Force Personnel Survey Program. 3.8.5.  Unit Manning Personnel Roster (UMPR). Collect assigned strength information from theUMPR. Also check with work center supervisor(s) to gather information on other full time/part timeborrowed or loaned personnel. 3.9.  Scheduling. The scope of the study will impact study completion time and scheduling. Following isone way to approach the scheduling activity: 3.9.1.  Estimate the time needed for various study activities. 3.9.2.  Identify the most effective order to accomplish tasks and which tasks can be done simulta-neously. 22AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.9.3.  Estimate the total study time by summing activity/task times; include time for report prepara-tion and staffing. 3.9.4.  Prepare a list of major milestones and completion dates (data collection, analysis, workshops,report preparation, key briefings, staffing, etc.). 3.9.5.  As required, prepare a detailed schedule identifying tasks, responsible team member, estimatedcompletion date, and task procedures. 3.10.  Study Alternative. Consider adapting an existing study or at least utilizing the information from anexisting study. Some possibilities are: 3.10.1.  Use information from previous manpower standards. 3.10.2.  Use other DoD or federal agency standards. Use private sector job standards. 3.10.3.  Use any portion of existing manpower standards that apply to the function under study. 3.10.4.  Consider the level of M&O community involvement. Projects which cut across units, bases,MAJCOMs, etc., should include and identify applicable M&O units as an audience in the Communi-cation Plan (see Figure 3.3. for an example). Depending on the project, they may be utilized for datacollection, validation, or to educate functional clients on how to perform certain project-related activ-ities. As a result, the appropriate M&O personnel should be kept informed of upcoming projects,timelines, and taskings that may impact them and their units. A Data Collection Plan (see Figure 3.4.for an example) assists with this effort. 3.10.5.  Consider the following client organization’s characteristics when planning. 3.10.5.1.  Complexity and Size. Large, complex functions require more planning, research, andstudy effort; consider cost and coverage needs. 3.10.5.2.  Stability. Studies of dynamic functions undergoing frequent reorganizations, changes inworkload, and shifts in responsibilities could be costly and long term. In these functions, considershort-term, low-cost studies. For standards development studies, also consider future maintenanceof the standard. 3.10.5.3.  Degree of Standardization in Organization, Procedures, Equipment, and Layout. Con-sider the level of standardization to determine measurement methods. For example, in a man-power standard development project, work sampling is appropriate for very standardizedfunctions, but very costly. Consider the level of effort and return on the effort when choosing mea-surement methods. 3.10.5.4.  External mandates. Consider legislative, Office of the Secretary Defense, Federal Avia-tion Administration and other mandates which limit scope of change. 3.11.  Scope Activity Descriptions.  3.11.1.  Micro. The overall method for communicating and participating in the project may be a func-tion of preexisting systems, such as weekly staff meetings, natural work groups, and preformed teams.However informal the planning, the participants must still understand the objective and goals of theproject as well as their roles and responsibilities. Simply letting participants know how much of theirtime they are expected to devote to the project can greatly clarify involvement. Some amount of datacollection will likely be necessary for any project and a plan to identify what data needs to beAFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200223obtained, where it exists, who is the OPR, and the timeline for collecting the data should be under-stood. Some methods to consider for collecting the data are surveys, workshops, existing documents,and databases. 3.11.2.  Mid-level. As the organizational and impact scope increase, so does the necessity for havinga plan to clarify “who will do what by when.” With expansion in project scope, the associated increasein data collection, analysis, communication, coordination, and necessary buy-in often requires sepa-rate plans to be developed. A communication plan can greatly improve the information flow to appro-priate audiences and ensure that no group is left out of the loop. Similarly, a data collection plan cantake proactive steps to identify what information will be needed during the project and who will beresponsible for collecting it. Finally, a project plan serves as a roadmap to help the team anticipateplanning events, and evaluate progress (or lack thereof). There are a number of commercial softwareprograms that can facilitate project planning. The project team may find it useful to also establish aMemorandum of Agreement (MOA) (see Figure 3.5. for an MOA format). 3.11.3.  Macro. For a larger-scoped project, often teams will be formed at different levels of control.Specifically, the project team would need to be formed, as well as the actual project team dedicated toworking the project from the partnered organization. Other smaller Issue, Process, or Tiger teams canbe identified, as opportunities emerge. Finally, there may be a need for an executive steering commit-tee to be formed, representing the project sponsor (as the chair, possibly) and key decision-makingpersonnel from across the organization such as MAJCOM or Air Staff functional managers. Thiscommittee would make senior decisions, be briefed on project status, and ensure buy-in at the seniorlevel across the organization. Each of these teams should understand its respective charter, the projectobjective(s), their participation responsibilities, and the Seven-Phase Approach. Depending on thescope and objectives of the project, certain subject matter experts (SMEs) will need to be identified assecondary/advisory team members (such as legal, Air Force Personnel Center, personnel, etc.) whowill participate when appropriate. A macro-level study often requires more formal planning for theproject, data collection, and/or communication, depending on the specific project objectives. Moredetail may be added to the project, data collection, and communication plans. Project-planning soft-ware or a standard spreadsheet may facilitate documenting the formal plan. A macro-scoped project,due to its often-heavy coordination and data collection burden, will probably benefit from a formal-ized MOA between the project team and the functional OPR. 3.12.  Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The MOA does a number of things for those involved in astudy or improvement initiative. It primarily specifies the purpose of the project and the responsibilities ofthe main participants. It is advisable to staff an MOA through the function’s chain of command and theM&O chain of command and have it signed by the senior partners; i.e., Air Staff or MAJCOM functionalOPR, AFMIA/CC, etc. A signed MOA ensures senior leadership approval and support of the project. 24AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Figure 3.3.

General Concepts. Identify the organization’s current state through analysis of “What do youdo?”, “Who is it done for?”, “How do you do it?”, “What does it cost to do it?”, and “How well do you doit?”. Answering all of these questions may be outside the interest of your respective project, but under-stand that the information associated with each one can prove very useful in later phases. As-Is data col-lection should be done at the highest possible level of analysis while still being able to answer theappropriate questions. The process of defining the As-Is state will identify worthwhile target processes forimprovements, uncover improvement opportunities within those processes and help focus opportunityresearch in Phase 4 (e.g., comparative analysis, benchmarking). Without the baseline provided by theAs-Is analysis, it becomes impossible to know if any organizational/process changes are truly better thanthe original state. For example, manpower changes associated with process redesign can only be quanti-fied if the initial manpower for the process is established. Collection of As-Is data can be done using themeasurement techniques outlined in volume 2 of this publication. Following are several specific consid-erations regarding each of the key As-Is question areas: 3.13.1.  What do you do? Regardless of the scope of the project, understanding the ultimate missionand outcome(s) of the target organization is a critical initial step in defining the current state. This willserve as the anchor to help identify additional information (e.g., “What products/services provideTHESE outcomes?”, “Who are the customers of these products and services [which deliver those out-comes]?”, “What processes create the products and services for these customers [who needs these out-comes]?”, etc). 3.13.1.1.  The project team must identify the appropriate sources of this initial information (e.g.,published plans, guidance, interviews, and workshops). Outputs and processes performed are alsouseful details to capture with regard to the “What do you do?” question. Often, current manpowerstandards, specifically the process oriented description (POD) statements, serve as a source forinitial process lists. If a current standard does not exist, or current processes are not defined in thestandard, a POD may need to be developed. POD development is discussed in paragraph 3.22. ofthis publication. 3.13.1.2.  An initial analysis of the process list considers whether it is truly directed by some guid-ance or higher level strategy. It is valuable in the As-Is phase to understand what you are doing,but it is also insightful to compare that to what you are required to do. The distinction may reflectdirected versus inferred/assumed work. The remaining nondirected work must be challenged andmay be an immediate source of work savings. The assumed work can be measured (see paragraph3.13.4.) to reflect workload and man-hours associated with work not mandated by the Departmentof Defense, Air Force, or MAJCOM. If assumed work processes are eliminated, the result wouldbe that the organization would have more time and possibly people to dedicate to doing the man-dated job. Having some idea of the recuperated workload may be considered worth the effort ofmeasuring the assumed workload. 3.13.2.  Who is it done for? Identifying the customer group(s) is valuable for several reasons. First, bydistinguishing these groups, you identify the sources of information on gathering current process per-formance (see paragraph 3.13.5.). Secondly, it establishes a baseline for current customers who can becompared to the future customers and the requirements that they will have for the To-Be products/ser-vices. Finally, by truly clarifying “Who uses this product/service,” or “Who demands this outcome?”certain perspectives/stakeholders may be included in the future design process that may have other-30AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002wise been ignored. This question identifies who currently has an opinion about your current perfor-mance and may dictate how good you need to be in the future. This is especially important when“level of service” is a major workload driver (e.g. requirements to serve a customer within one minutevs. 15 minutes at a commissary checkout would influence the manpower requirement). 3.13.3.  How do you do it? The process can be listed or flowed out at an appropriate level of detail toidentify redundancy, wasted time, unnecessary steps, under/over-utilized people, etc. Process flow orprocess mapping diagramming techniques are discussed in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, and reflectjust one of many ways to capture this information. In addition, organizational charts, physical layouts,etc. may be useful in painting a clear picture on how efficiently/inefficiently the products/services arebeing produced for the customers. Ideally, this activity should be performed on processes after theprocesses have been prioritized and selected for improvement based on established criteria. 3.13.4.  What does it cost to do it? Of particular interest here is identifying the current manpower,equipment, and supply costs associated with performing the organization’s mission and processes.Ultimately, this will serve as the baseline to which the To-Be state’s manpower will be compared. Asa result, the project team must identify the level of detail in which resources must be identified. Forexample, will the Air Force Corporate Board approving the To-Be state want to have the costs/sav-ings/new requirements broken out by processes? If so, having a by-process breakdown of currentresource costs may be necessary. On the other hand, if the project sponsor or project team feels thatonly high-evel resource data will be necessary for the leadership body to compare (total current autho-rized manpower), then the data collection may simply come from the current manpower standard orthe currently documented funded and unfunded authorizations on the UMD. Consideration also needsto be given regarding other resource costs. For example, should facility and equipment costs be cap-tured, and if so, is it necessary to break them out by processes? Activity-Based Costing is one usefultool for assigning resource costs to tasks and outputs (cost objects). Knowing resource costs at a highlevel is also useful for prioritizing processes, so that you can identify which processes are worthimproving. Typically, processes that are important to the mission consume most of the resources(manpower, dollars, etc.) and warrant the effort of collecting and analyzing data, doing opportunityresearch and redesigning. Below are some benefits and drawbacks associated with differentapproaches to As-Is manpower cost analysis. 3.13.4.1.  Detailed (low-level) Manpower Costing by Process. This represents the most accuratetime and cost-intensive data collection method. Process frequencies and per accomplishmenttimes (PATs) are collected in some forum, such as actual field measurement or from workshopinput, to identify the manpower cost associated with the process. If existing manpower documentshave this information broken out by processes, some time can be saved. Additional informationmay be gathered regarding the process as well. For example, crew size, required skill level,required grade level, and workload factors (WLF) may be identified as current process measuresof interest. The main benefits of this approach are: sound data is available for prioritizing/selectingwhich processes should be improved, the data is useful for comparing process costs when doingcomparative analysis and benchmarking with other organizations, and it lays the groundwork forthe To-Be manpower standard. The drawbacks are as follows: it is time intensive and processesare costed out even though they may ultimately be determined not worthwhile or have room toimprove (after prioritization). Data collection in workshops or from the field can be automated,possibly reducing project time for this level of cost data collection. One valuable technique is toutilize a “GroupWare” platform, where workshop participants can submit data using computerslinked to a common server. Many participants can enter workload estimates simultaneously, andAFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200231the computer can integrate the information almost immediately. The validity of the data dependson the quality of the data submitted by the participants. Very dissimilar estimates of common pro-cess workload can be addressed in the meeting, leading to consensus or a requirement for a man-power site visit.  3.13.4.2.  High-Level Manpower Costing by Process. Each process is assigned a cost based on theestimate of total resources associated with it. This estimate can be collected in a workshop envi-ronment with SMEs or using other techniques. The total resources for the organization can bemultiplied by the percent estimate to arrive at a manpower per process cost estimate, useful forprioritizing and selecting worthwhile processes to improve. The selected processes can then becosted out to more detail as described in paragraph 3.13.4.1., if appropriate, for the study. Benefitsinclude: less time required, data is still available for prioritizing/selecting processes, detailed cost-ing is only performed on worthwhile processes, and some degree of cost data is available for com-parative analysis and benchmarking. Remember that the current authorized manpower is areflection of both direct and indirect workload. The indirect workload is separate from what theprocess being estimated requires, and should be subtracted out of the authorized total prior to com-parison. For example, if the current authorized manpower for 5 processes was 100, some of that100 is a reflection of indirect work, and should be subtracted out prior to estimating the relativeworkload to accomplish each individual process. The manpower associated with the indirect workwill be reflected in a Standard Indirect Allowed Man-hour (SIAM) equation (See AFMAN38-208, Volume 2), and therefore should be subtracted out of the total authorized manpower inorder to isolate the direct workload. 3.13.4.3.  High-Level Manpower Costing for Organization/Work center(s). Some project teamsand sponsors may wish to only evaluate bottom-line manpower for the organization or work cen-ter(s) in the As-Is phase. This would be represented by the manpower requirements (funded andunfunded) documented on the UMD. Benefits include minimal time involved with costing As-Ismanpower costs. Drawbacks include: no costs broken down by process making As-Is versusTo-Be process cost comparison impossible; no cost data to prioritize and select processes toimprove; and no data to compare process costs in comparative analysis. 3.13.4.4.  Reach-back Costing Option. If a high-level costing option is used, an opportunity stillexists to create detailed As-Is cost data at a later time in the project. In a reactive approach theproject team can elect to wait until improvement recommendations are identified (for the To-Bestate), but prior to implementation, to measure the As-Is process(es) which changed. This mini-mizes measurement and still allows comparison of As-Is and To-Be costs. 3.13.5.  How Well Do You Do It? This is the effectiveness dimension, which cannot be ignored. Veryfew Air Force organizations have a formal approach to capture this information, but this performanceinformation identifies improvement opportunities and ultimately provides insight into effectiveness ofthe improvement effort. As-Is process performance may be available in inspection reports, cycle timedata, customer complaints, rework, on-time work, and other performance measures. In addition, sincethe customer defines what is and is not good performance, collecting performance information fromthe customer is ideal. Surveys, focus group interviews, individual interviews, field measurement orworkshops are some methods for capturing such data. Current performance may be a useful criterionto use when prioritizing and selecting processes to improve. For example, a high resource cost, andhigh value (to the Air Force or the organization) process may initially not appear to be a worthwhiletarget for improvement. Only by understanding that the current performance level is below par does32AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002this process become a necessary target for improvement. Likewise, if performance is outstanding,then the opportunity for improvement might be considered less beneficial. 3.14.  Scope Activity Descriptions. In many project scenarios, a prioritization of processes/steps/issuesbased on some criteria are performed so that only viable processes/steps/issues are targeted for improve-ment. It may become obvious at this time that lower priority processes, for example, may not provideenough return on the investment of time and resources to warrant improving. As a result, it may be onlythrough the collecting and analyzing of As-Is data that the scope of the project is adjusted down. A projectmay initially be perceived as a macro-scope effort, but only after profiling, prioritizing, and selectingimprovement targets does it become clear that the scope is more focused than originally thought. It is justas possible, however, that the objectives of the project may require a broadening of the scope, once theAs-Is picture becomes clearer. For any project scope, the sponsor or project team decides on what level ofdata collection and analysis is appropriate. Workshop data collection is a common technique for thisphase, re-emphasizing the importance of knowledgeable and representative participant selection. 3.14.1.  Micro. This type of project identifies a focused target for improvement. The data collectionburden is somewhat lower than a larger scoped project because only data on a single process needs tobe collected. The “What, For Whom, How, How Much, and How Well” questions can also be col-lected relatively quickly by engaging SMEs and appropriate sources of data, typically from the localorganization. For example, customers can be identified and interviewed or surveyed relatively easilyin a micro-scoped project. If manpower requirement determination is of interest, the level of detail fordata collection will depend on the sponsor interest. Even for smaller scoped projects, automated datacollection can serve as a useful tool in collecting cost data, customer inputs, mapping, and perhapseven simulation of the process. If validation of data is necessary, the fact that the improvement effortis localized should require a relatively manageable coordination task. Appropriate approving authori-ties at all levels should be kept informed, as should be outlined in the Communications Plan. The FiveFronts described in paragraph 3.3.1. should be considered when trying to understand all possible fac-tors effecting even a local and focused process. 3.14.2.  Mid-level. By definition, this type of project scope includes more processes or a larger pieceof the organization, but typically has limited processes identified allowing each process to be evalu-ated. The target processes may cut across several work centers or MAJCOMs, requiring a larger coor-dination and communication effort in order to collect data and gain buy-in. The processes of interestmay have been selected based on an obvious need for improvement, large resources associated withconducting the processes, or they may be the result of a prioritization and selection of key processesfrom a larger initial process list. Whatever the origin, the target processes need to be run through theremaining As-Is questions. Gathering valid cost data (manpower, equipment, supplies, [ABC is atechnique that uses the cost data] etc.), regulations which identify the mandated processes, customerinputs, and current performance measures at this scope will require more coordination and input fromthe functional community it impacts. Workshops, field measurement, internet research, site visits, andsurveys are some methods of collecting such information. Collect as much of this data as possible dur-ing the familiarization phase of the project and present it to the project team or sponsor for validation.In addition to gathering and analyzing the data, the processes should be mapped out at the appropriatelevel of detail to uncover process inefficiencies, and to assist in future manpower determinant compar-isons. Some time should also be taken by the project team to consider the Five Fronts relative to theprocesses under consideration. This approach can identify constraints, As-Is organizational architec-ture, technology standardization, and people-related issues such as training status and utilization. TheAFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200233outcome of the data collection and analysis outlined above should provide a useful and insightfulAs-Is picture of the organization and the improvement-worthy processes. 3.14.3.  Macro. Creating an As-Is picture of an organization in a macro scope project may requiresome information to be organized. By definition, this type of project scope includes multiple pro-cesses of the organization, has a large Air Force impact (crossing several MAJCOM(s)s, a wholefunction, multiple functions, or the whole Air Force), and may necessitate prioritization of processes.To accomplish this, a list of current processes is generated (typically from a POD in the current man-power standard), possibly reflecting mandated and assumed work processes in addition to the PODlist. If no current list of processes exists, a POD will need to be generated using tools and techniqueslike brainstorming, or current directive documents. Often, taking a step back to identify the true cur-rent mission and objectives for the organization can prove useful in establishing a point from whichthe customers, outputs, and processes can be identified. Such information can come from missionstatements, strategic plans, organizational documents, directives, senior leadership input, etc. Criteriafor prioritization of processes should be defined (e.g., manpower resources dedicated to the process,mission criticality, current performance “gap” [i.e., problem processes], etc). If necessary, these crite-ria can be weighted differently to reflect their respective importance. Each process can then be ratedrelative to the different criteria, and weighted total ratings for each process will reflect the prioritiza-tion. Based on the time availability and interest of the study, an important exercise may be to prioritizethe process list while it includes assumed work. If a criterion for prioritization is manpower cost to dothe process, and an assumed work process is identified as consuming a lot of resources, this may beimportant information to present to senior leadership. If time or interest does not permit the evaluationand improvement of all processes, the top processes from the prioritized list can be selected for theproject. The selected processes are then mapped. Some time should also be taken by the project teamto consider the Five Fronts relative to the processes under consideration. This approach can identifyconstraints, As-Is organizational architecture, technology standardization, and people-related issuessuch as training status and utilization. Often, in a macro-scoped project, the Policy Front can be a sig-nificant contributor to process inefficiency and may require consideration of modifying policy in theTo-Be state. The outcome of the data collection and analysis outlined above should provide a usefuland insightful As-Is picture of the organization and the improvement-worthy processes. 3.15.  Quick Wins.  During this phase, obvious improvement opportunities often emerge which wouldrequire minimal effort and coordination to implement. These “quick wins” improvements can be as sim-ple as deleting an obviously redundant step in a process, eliminating the production of a report which noone uses, introducing a coordination step to eliminate unnecessary miscommunication, or using a moreappropriate tool in a process. Such decisions can immediately improve operations and serve a great pur-pose in establishing or maintaining momentum for the project. In the context of change management,even simple, minor changes which eliminate unnecessary work send out a message that this project reallyintends to make things better, thus improving the likelihood of buy-in from the field-level workers. Evenminor changes such as these should still be documented and carried forward to the To-Be phase and finalreport. Section 3E—Opportunity Research--Phase 4 3.16.  General Concepts.  The Opportunity Research Phase is simply about identifying appropriatechanges. Two things have to happen. First, we have to answer the questions, “What is the environment(current and/or future), and what are the requirements in that environment?” The environmental scan34AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002addresses these by identifying trends, restrictions, boundaries, developments, etc., that will impact theorganization or process. The project team as a whole can do this scan or specific processes or dimensionsof the environment can be assigned to subgroups to focus on. This information is then run through the “fil-ter” of, “So what does all this mean to the organization/process we want to change?” The outcome of thisanalysis is an identification of areas where changes need to happen. Second, the project team or subgrouphas to figure out where the changes should come from and what they should be. Some improvement ideasmay be obvious or intuitive. Other appropriate changes are not so obvious. Innovative thinking oftenrequires looking outside the organization at how others are handling similar requirements, processes,activities, etc. If improvement ideas are only developed from within, the organization runs the risk of sim-ply recreating its As-Is state or missing a real opportunity to see what others have figured out. This is thepurpose of the Research step in this phase. Comparison and benchmark organizations are identified,researched, and analyzed to generate possible improvement ideas which will meet current and/or futurerequirements. Figure 3.6. provides an overview of this phase, with the “focus” path being defined by theintent of the project. Two main dimensions make up Opportunity Research: Environmental Scanning andthe eventual Researching for Opportunities. Figure 3.6.  Opportunity Research Diagram. Figure 3.6. represents where to look for those improvement opportunities that will be based on the focus(current, future, combination) of the project. Table 3.1. outlines how the different focus results in a differ-ent level of analysis regarding how broad the scan should be, then an environmental scan would need tobe conducted to articulate just what IS the future environment. In this case, the environmental scan wouldidentify future customer requirements, trends and other potential factors which will define the operatingenvironment of the To-Be organization. Opportunity research targets organizations that are currentlyAFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200235excelling at those things (e.g., competencies, processes, and activities) the project organization must per-form in the future. A combination focus is also possible (represented by the dashed line), with short-termimprovement research targets being identified for immediate improvements, and other targets beingresearched for longer-term initiatives aimed at handling future requirements. A type of concurrent envi-ronmental scan (current and future customer requirements, factors) would happen in this scenario toaddress both process improvements that address what needs to get done and those things that WILL needto get done. A more detailed description of Environmental Scan and Researching for Opportunities arepresented in Table 3.1. Table 3.1.

The primary issues to address in this phase are, “What’s happening cur-rently?” What’s coming?”, and “What does it mean to this organization/process?” The first two ques-tions constitute gaining situational awareness relative to the organization or process of interest. The36AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002last question is critical, because without it, the exercise is simply research without application.Depending on the project, it may be necessary to scan the environment for possible factors, technolo-gies, or trends affecting the current or future organization/process or may affect the future organiza-tion/process. The environment can be broken out in many different ways, as described below inFigure 3.7. Within each environmental dimension, often societal, economic, political, technological,or other aspects can be investigated. Often, a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT)analysis is a useful way to understand what all this information means to the process or organization.Using a facilitated exercise, the workshop participants (or subgroup members) analyze the strengths,weaknesses, opportunities, and threats for the organization in light of the environmental informationcollected. This is the “So what?” or “What does it mean to us?” application, which is so critical foridentifying improvement options. Figure 3.7.  Dimensions of the Environment. The project team can investigate the future environment for the organization across environmentaldimensions (like the ones above), or teams/subgroups/individuals can be assigned specific processesto evaluate against these dimensions. Another approach is to have subgroups focus on scanning onedimension’s impact on all relevant processes. Finally, the group or subgroups can be tasked to evalu-ate a single or multiple “Aspects to consider” within each dimension or across all the dimensions. Thespecific dimensions are described below: 3.16.1.1.  Macro Environment. This is a world-wide view; it evaluates relevant issues in society atlarge. Typical sources might be the internet, Cable News Network (CNN), Early Bird, long-rangeplanning documents, Defense Technical Info Center homepage, etc. 3.16.1.2.  Industry Environment. This identifies relevant issues in organizations with similar mis-sion, customer, product, or service. Typical sources include defense industry journals, internet,newspapers, Early Bird, USAF Strategic Plan, etc. 3.16.1.3.  Customer Environment. This provides insight into demographics, segments, trends, pat-terns, and requirements. If information is gathered directly from the customer, this can be a pow-AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200237erful and insightful source. Any customer information (recommendations, future requirements,etc.) collected in the As-Is can be very useful at this point. Other ways to gather this informationcan be through surveys, focus groups, workshops, internet, magazines, General Accounting Officereports, internet sites, customer strategic plans, etc. 3.16.2.  Strengths- Weaknesses- Opportunities- Threats (SWOT) Analysis. By examining internalstrengths, the project team can discover untapped potential. Examining internal weaknesses, theproject team can identify gaps in performance, vulnerabilities, and erroneous assumptions about theirexisting strategies. The external opportunities and threats are the positive and negative characteristicsof the external environment. Using information gathered from available sources, study teams canidentify opportunities for improvement and assess threats to determine the organization’s ability todefend against them. Using the information gathered in the As-Is analysis and the EnvironmentalScan, some analysis has to be performed to understand what it means to build the To-Be state. What-ever approach is taken to do SWOT analysis, some consideration should be given for the differentdimensions of each aspect of the environment. The outcome of this activity is a list of things to exploitor overcome in order to excel in the future environment. Several Approaches can be taken. 3.16.2.1.  The team as a whole can create lists of Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats forthe whole organization (or processes under consideration) using tools like flip charts, grease-boards, or electronic groupware. This would focus on all of the dimensions, and would considerany appropriate aspects for the processes. 3.16.2.2.  Subgroups can focus on a single dimension of the environments, considering any appro-priate aspects of information that may be useful (for example, group 2 might be assigned the com-petitive dimension of the environment). They would consider things like technological, politicaland societal trends to create a SWOT for that dimension. The subgroups would then out-brief eachother to create a master SWOT for the whole organization that collectively addresses all aspects ofthe environment. 3.16.2.3.  Subgroups can focus on a single aspect to consider (for example, group 2 could focus onjust TECHNOLOGY), and would identify SWOT issues across all of the environmental dimen-sions and processes. 3.16.2.4.  Subgroups can be assigned the responsibility of generating one piece of the SWOT (forexample, group 2 might focus just on THREATS). They would need to be familiar with the Envi-ronmental Scan information across all of the different environmental dimensions. The subgroupswould then out-brief to compile their master SWOT analysis. 3.16.2.5.  Subgroups (or individuals) can be assigned specific processes to evaluate against theenvironmental information. The master SWOT would then simply be the sum of the SWOTs forthe different processes (plus any issues which may obviously cut across processes). 3.16.2.6.  Use any other approach which evaluates the organization or its processes relative to theenvironmental scan information. 3.16.3.  Researching for Opportunities. Whether the focus is current or future, the research activity ofOpportunity Research is where the new ideas for improvement come from. The SWOT analysis hasidentified the gap between current and future. It identifies where you are strong, where you are weak,and what realistic performance levels are. Finally, by evaluating how/how well others perform similartasks, processes, or outcomes, new methods for improved performance may become clear. 38AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.16.3.1.  There are basically two types of researches: Primary and Secondary. 3.16.3.1.1.  Primary Research is the practice of searching for information about a particularsubject using direct sources, which include (but are not limited to) making direct contact withthe potential partner using e-mail, telephone surveys, mail/fax surveys, and face-to-face inter-views. The Internet/World Wide Web (WWW) contains a number of information sources andcontacts relevant to best practices and benchmarking. 3.16.3.1.2.  Secondary Research is the practice of searching for information about a particularsubject using indirect sources, which include (but are not limited to) using books, newspapers,journals, etc. The Internet/WWW contains a number of information sources and contacts rele-vant to best practices and benchmarking. 3.16.3.2.  Three activities take place in the Research for Opportunities step: Identify benchmarktargets, perform comparative analysis, and perform benchmarking research (or some less formalinformation gathering). 3.16.3.2.1.  Identify benchmark targets. Target organizations or processes are selected becausethey either do well what you need to do now, or they do well what you will need to do. Eitherway, some aspect of “what” they do should be similar, but it does not need to be identical. Tar-gets can come from inside or outside the project organization. An obvious first source for tar-gets should be from a best practices clearinghouse to possibly locate the current outstandingperformers in the same process (to compare “apples to apples”). See AFMIA’s home page,and click on Best Practices, for assistance. This is called functionally picking a target. Othertargets may be less directly related, sharing similar type outcomes or components of the pro-cess. For example, an aircraft maintenance department identified that the future environmentwill require faster turn around time on their planes. They selected a top Indy pit crew to evalu-ate and benchmark. Another example of a generic or outcome-based comparison was the BirdAircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) program. The project members identified that this is a crisisresponse type process that needs to be improved. They evaluated who currently does crisisresponse well, and selected a top-ranked fire department as the benchmark target. The idea offorward-positioning equipment was just one valuable improvement option that came out ofthis generic target selection. Often the most dramatic results come from selecting a target thatis very different from the project organization. 3.17.  Comparative Analysis. This step evaluates the performance difference and the magnitude of thatdifference between the project organization (process) and the target. Let’s say that the BASH processidentified the fire department as a target because they were top performers in a similar crisis responsefield. Comparative analysis would identify that the fire department can respond to a crisis and be on sitein three minutes. Here is where As-Is performance measurement becomes important. Proper As-Is defini-tion ensures that you have data for comparison. “How much better is three minutes than your organiza-tion’s performance?” The less information that is known about the As-Is performance or resources, theharder a comparison will be. It can be dangerous to make an improvement recommendation without thisinformation. For example, if the benchmarking target organization can respond in three minutes on a cer-tain process, and the project organization can respond in three minutes, it may appear that no improve-ment opportunity exists. But if it takes the target organization half of the manpower to respond in that timethan the project organization does, there is great opportunity for adopting improvements. Unless ofcourse, the project organization does not know how many manpower resources the response processAFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200239takes. Comparative analysis uncovers performance gaps between how the project organization and thetarget organization are performing. 3.18.  Benchmarking. If comparative analysis answers “How much?” of a difference exists between theproject organization and the target, then benchmarking answers “How do they achieve that much perfor-mance?” It focuses on the actual task or process accomplishment, and uncovers possible techniques, tools,or approaches which can help the project organization improve. Benchmarking is the process of findingand adapting best practices to improve organizational performance. True benchmarking is a formal pro-cess of partnering and sharing information. For this type of information gathering, there is a formal bench-marking code of conduct and a formal approach to conducting a benchmarking study. Formalbenchmarking studies often provide outstanding information, but can be time consuming and labor inten-sive, which may be unreasonable for your particular study. For less formal investigative research, otherapproaches can be used. Informal benchmarking can result from site visits (“industrial tourism”), televi-sion/media, previous experiences, or other sources. The goal of both formal and informal benchmarkingis to uncover the approaches which may be adapted (not adopted) to fit and improve the project organiza-tion. Seldom, if ever, will a best practice approach or improvement idea uncovered during this researchtransition smoothly into another organization. The ultimate recommendations that come from Opportu-nity Research will be either to maintain the status quo of the processor or do one of the following: 3.18.1.  Improve. This typically results from a redesign of the process. The improvement can be any-where from minor to dramatic, even requiring the process to be designed from scratch. An improve-ment recommendation can cut across many functions or departments, or it can simply change how asingle unit completes the process. Whatever the degree of change being proposed, the process ownersshould be critically involved in designing the improvement recommendations. Typical improvementrecommendations are multi-skilling workers, eliminating redundancies, inserting technology to auto-mate or assist process steps (e.g., a grocery clerk using a scanner), modifying the processes to flowmore smoothly, gearing the process more for the customer, removing unnecessary layers of manage-ment, or modifying unnecessarily restrictive policies. Of course, there are limitless other ways toimprove processes. Notice that some of these improvements may cut across many processes, func-tions, or departments. Consider the interrelationship of the five fronts when developing improvementideas. Changes in technology, for instance, may require changes or improvements in training. Someimprovement ideas may require relatively little coordination or implementation time. Such “quickwins” are opportunities for immediate improvement in current processes that may build organiza-tional momentum for change. Throughout all the project phases and activities, the teams will collectsuggestions for changes. These may range from relatively simple improvement ideas to more complexopportunities. Implementing “quick wins” is a way to show immediate results from the project and tobuild momentum by actually beginning to change things while the project is in progress. Team mem-bers should be alert for opportunities for immediate process improvement as they gather data in work-shops, interviews, and through quantitative analysis. Potential “quick wins” should be documentedwhen identified, including benefits, timing, cost and any additional research assigned to design teamor extended team members. Analysis at this point need not be rigorous. Criteria for “quick wins” willhelp qualify ideas as they arise (e.g., cost under $10,000 and take less than 30 to 60 days to imple-ment). These criteria will vary based on the size of the organization and the scope of the project. Com-mon “quick wins” include elimination of low value activities or activities that are no longer necessary,such as multi-part forms, administrative reports that are no longer relevant, or services that are nolonger demanded. It may be helpful to provide a common format to document and track “quick wins”or other short term opportunities. One sample format is shown below: 40AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Figure 3.8.  Example of a Quick Win Plan. Quick Win PlanExample Quick Win Title:                                         OPR: Action: Benefit:                                                     Impact: Start Date:                                         Finish Date: Quick Win Cost:                                       Issues: 3.18.2.  Eliminate. In some projects, a process, subprocess, or activity is identified as somethingwhich may be outside the mission of the organization, is unnecessary, or will not be needed in thefuture environment. In these cases, the proposal to eliminate the process or activity may be appropri-ate. For example, one agency was still spending resources to generate a report which was not used byanyone. The process to create this report was eliminated. Another example may be for a function oragency to eliminate conducting an annual conference. Opportunity research may have identified amore cost-effective method for disseminating information (if that outcome is still desired). 3.18.2.1.  If a detailed costing strategy was used in the As-Is phase then savings associated witheliminating the performance of a process or activity can be clearly estimated. If manpower costsand facility costs were defined for a process and that process is eliminated, the cost savings shouldbe relatively easy to determine. If a more high level As-Is costing strategy was used, then thisinformation can still be attained, but will require detailed costing analysis at this time (seeReach-Back Costing in the As-Is Phase, paragraph 3.13.4.4.). 3.18.2.2.  Elimination of any process or activity can have impacts on other functions or depart-ments, which may rely on, or be involved with that process. Whenever elimination is recom-mended, generate a list of customers and stakeholders of the eliminated process or activity.Coordinate and communicate this change with them. In addition, consider the Five Fronts wheneliminating anything. Will it impact training, technology, career progression, policy/guidance,facilities, etc? 3.18.2.3.  Many organizations confuse improving performance with shifting responsibilitybecause it eases workload. Perhaps in the As-Is or Environmental Scanning phases, it becameobvious that an organization’s mission does not require it to do something it currently does. Theresulting suggestion may be to transfer the work to another organization or function, or to out-source the work. 3.18.2.4.  Transferring the work requires coordination and buy-in from the organization assumingresponsibility. The ultimate decision-making authority for the To-Be will ask whether this assum-AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200241ing organization agrees with the proposal to shift the work to them. If not, the proposal will likelybe disapproved until agreement is reached. Manpower issues also will exist based on the autho-rized manpower assigned to that workload. As the workload shifts, so too should the authorizedmanpower. 3.18.2.5.  If outsourced, legal restrictions will need to be followed. Again, customers and stake-holders must be contacted to ensure that the contracted service meets their requirements. One wayto accomplish this is to have customer and/or stakeholders present when drafting the SOW, or atleast give them an opportunity to review the requirements. It is the customer’s responsibility todraft the SOW and have manpower and contracting assistance. 3.19.  Options Package. Whatever the proposed solutions, they should be documented and presented in away that is useful and rigorous for the sponsor(s) to make a decision. If possible, costs and benefits shouldbe described for the proposed changes and improvements. In some cases, the project sponsors may wishto select from several options or scenarios. Ideally, this should have been articulated by the sponsor dur-ing the Project Definition or Planning Phases, so that the project team or subgroups could have collectedinformation and researched with this context in mind. Some possible scenarios are listed below: 3.19.1.  Best Case/ Most Likely/Least Likely. It may be a reflection of the future environment beingeither friendly or nonfriendly to the organization/function. Figure 3.9.  Prepare Options Scenarios Example.                                                    Prepare Options                                             (May be scenario-based) Best Case   - Decentralize all operations   - Eliminate Key Process 1   - Combine Key Processes 2 & 4 Most Likely   - Streamline all key processes with new computer technology Least Likely   - Benchmark key process 1   - Streamline key processes 2,3,4 3.19.2.  Low Cost/ High Cost/ Middle of Road. The groups may develop different proposals or com-binations of proposals based on how restrictive the budget is. 3.19.3.  Future Scenario1/Future Scenario2. It may be specifically defined by the sponsor (“I want oneoption that assumes that air expeditionary forces are in place, and another that assumes it is not.”) orcan be developed from the Environmental Scan. 42AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Figure 3.10.  Future Environment(s) Options Example.                                               Prepare Options         (May be several options for one or more future environments) If future environment is “X”   - Decentralize all operations   - Eliminate Key Process 1   - Combine Key Processes 2 & 4  If future environment is “Y”, choose 1   - Streamline all key processes with new computer technology   - Benchmark key process 1   - Streamline key processes 2,3,4 3.19.4.  Single option. The sponsor may simply leave the design up to the Project Team, and onlyrequire a single solution be presented. This may be an option if the Sponsor had a clear vision of whatthe To-Be organization should look like, and the project team was simply tasked with proposingHOW it should get there. 3.19.5.  Multiple Options. The sponsor may want several options to pick from. This may be one of thescenarios listed above, or he or she may have some other criteria for defining the option categories. 3.19.6.  Menu listing. This may simply be a prioritized list of improvement proposals which the spon-sor can select to design the To-Be state he or she wants developed. 3.19.7.  Each proposal may be presented with the cost/benefit/timeline described, such as in the exam-ple in Figure 3.11. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200243Figure 3.11.  To-Be Options/Initiatives Example.                                                 “TO BE” OPTIONS/INITIATIVES                                                                     FAC XXXX TITLE: (title of initiative) CURRENT METHOD:  (Describe in detail the current method so senior leadership understands current method) PROPOSED METHOD:  (Describe in enough detail the proposed method in relation to the current method, so senior leadership can visualize the potential ramifications) SCOPE:   (Indicate the applicability, i.e., multi-command, AEF, fighter wings, etc.) BENEFITS:  (Describe in detail the savings in process times, customer times, or level of service, etc., to include an actual or notional impact AF-wide,  Indicate the specific POD process number and title) RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER INITIATIVES:  (Self-explanatory) OPTIONS:  (Other option to be considered in relation to this one, separate sheet attached) COSTS:  (Estimated costs of implementing option.  Describe in detail) DISCUSSION: (Describe in detail below the pros, cons, cost benefits, benchmarking info, etc) PRO: (Indicate any savings referencing a revised POD/PAT/FREQ) CON: RECOMMENDATION:  (Recommendation of workshop representatives and for which option) MAJCOM POSITION:ATTACHMENTS:  (Attach a current POD and a revised POD.  Highlight areas of change) 3.19.8.  The option(s) selected by the project sponsor will provide the direction and strategy for theTo-Be organization. Detail and action groups will be formed to “add flesh” to the selected option. Anydetailed manpower savings are reflected in the To-Be scenario and briefed to the Air Force CorporateBoard. 3.19.8.1.  The MO study analyst’s role includes an “honest broker” responsibility for identifyingto Air Force senior leadership options to improve effective and efficient use of manpowerresources. 44AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.19.8.2.  In those cases where the sponsor is unwilling to pursue what otherwise appears to theMO analyst as a viable option, this should be internally documented for presentation separate fromthe sponsor’s position. 3.19.9.  Micro. Simply because the scope of this type of project is “small” does not mean that theopportunity research phase needs to be insignificant. Even for projects that focus on one process (oractivity) and have a local impact, the environment (current or future) for that process still needs to beunderstood. Perform environmental scanning in either a team or subgroups to collect informationabout trends, factors, limitations, requirements, etc., which the To-Be design will need to address.Conduct a SWOT analysis to identify and understand the impact these environmental factors willhave on the target process. Identify targets to research for improvement ideas. Internet, publications,interviews, site visits, past experience, and obvious intuitive improvements may be ways to generateideas. The improvements options (improve, eliminate, divest) may or may not need to be formallydocumented for approval, based on the requirements of the study. The more coordination andapproval required for the improvements, the more useful a formally documented options package willbe. Implement, but still document any “quick wins” identified along the way. 3.19.10.  Mid-level. As the number of processes, amount of the overall organization, and/or the levelof impact to the Air Force increases, so too may the detail in the Opportunity Research. More com-plex, cross-functional or cross-departmental issues or processes may require a deeper analysis of envi-ronmental issues, as well as more formalized benchmarking and information gathering. As researchincreases in formality, it becomes more critical to have useful, detailed cost and performance informa-tion available for comparison with a “target” benchmark. For example, if the environmental scan hasindicated that Just-In-Time training will be necessary in the future, and you have selected the “best inclass” organization at such training, comparative analysis will be difficult if you do not know the costor method you currently use for providing your training. How much better are they than you are? Howdifferently do they perform the process? This is important to know in order to adapt their method (vsadopting) to fit your context. More traditional benchmarking techniques may be necessary inMid-Level projects, as will the formality of documentation of the improvement options. The numberof improvement options and the method of presentation (scenarios, list of ideas, etc.) should be dis-cussed and dictated by the project sponsor. Because of the wider impact to other Air Force organiza-tions or a larger number of organizational processes being impacted, the Five Fronts need to beconsidered to identify indirect impacts or related issues arising from any changes. 3.19.11.  Macro. In an organization-wide (holistic) project, larger, more global factors will come intoplay in the environmental scanning step. Also, coordination and communication requirements willincrease, emphasizing the usefulness in having stakeholders and other impacted organizationsinvolved in the options development. This may be as simple as reviewing the proposals, or may be tothe level of participating in the workshops or activities. For example, if the project scope is across anentire Air Force function, having appropriate process owners from across the MAJCOMs participatein workshops, analysis, research, or idea development increases the chance of buy-in and expands thepool of perspectives from which to draw new ideas. The outcome documents and findings from theEnvironmental Scan and SWOT analysis should be coordinated for review and feedback to all appro-priate stakeholders. For larger projects such as this, it is often useful to assign processes or dimensionsof the organization (i.e., training and technology) to subgroups. These groups can environmentallyscan, perform SWOT analysis, and research their respective area of interest. Of course, some crossflow of information will need to occur to ensure that each subgroup is aware of the assumptions andfindings of other subgroups. Surveys, interviews, site visits, and formal/informal benchmarking tech-AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200245niques may all be used to different levels to the project. Project timeline and resources will dictate theappropriate level of research. Final consideration to the Five Fronts should be given across all of therecommendations in order to address any issues that impact other organizational areas, policies, pro-grams, or other recommendations. Once research is complete, the improvement recommendations canbe consolidated and coordinated for final review prior to presenting them to the sponsor. Consideringthe scope of the study, all improvement recommendations (including “quick wins”) should be for-mally documented. The number of improvement options and the method of presentation (scenarios,list of ideas, etc.) should be discussed with and dictated by the project sponsor. Section 3F—To-Be Process Development--Phase 5 3.20.  General Concepts.  The outputs of the previous phase are improvement recommendations/optionspresented to the project sponsor for some decision. Based on the intent and scope of the project, costs andbenefits associated with each option or recommendation will likely be presented. The project sponsor(s)must make some decision as to which options should be developed into a detailed improvement plan to bepresented to the ultimate decision making authority. These selected process designs, short/long-term ini-tiatives, or changes to current operations should satisfy the criteria for project success stated by the spon-sor(s) in the Project Definition phase. When developed, the new design should also satisfy the customerrequirements in the current or future environment. If necessary for the project, the resources needed toaccomplish the newly designed processes (or tasks or activities) should be identified. Functional mea-sures, which will be used to evaluate the “strength” of this new design, should also be designed. 3.21.  Selection of Improvement Options.  The project sponsor(s) should have criteria selected forobjectively evaluating the proposed options. The criteria may have been identified in the Project Defini-tion Phase. Other criteria may be costly to implement, expected benefit to the organization, likelihood ofsupport from the boss, probability of implementing within a certain period of time, or any other rating heor she thinks is useful. It is sometimes useful to group the options for selection. For example, creating cat-egories for short/mid/long-term implementation may allow the sponsor to more easily select or prioritizewithin those categories. In some cases, the sponsors may consider the criteria to be weighted differently.If the number of improvement options is high, if the criteria are weighted differently, or if a number ofsponsors have to be involved in selection, decision-making software (groupware) can serve as a valuabletool for speeding up the evaluation and selection process. If no such software is available, have the spon-sor(s) rate each option on each criteria on a scale of 1 to 10. When creating a rating scale, having the ratersclearly understand, “What does a 1, 5 and 10 mean” becomes critically important to ensure consistency ofratings. Take the time to do this right, or the ratings will be meaningless. Notice in the following examplehow the prioritization order changes when the “Support” criteria was weighted twice as much as the othercriteria. Selection of an option or a collection of improvement proposals/initiatives constitutes a definitionof the strategy for the To-Be organization. The sponsor defines the direction, and the project teamassumes the responsibility of creating the detailed plan for bringing it to life. This plan will be coordinatedand presented to the final decision making authority for approval. 46AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Figure 3.12.  Example of a Prioritization/Rating Matrix Prioritization/Rating Matrix Example Criteria Options Low Cost Ease of Implementation 1 2 3 8 6 4 9 4 8                          (2x) Support Total                           (8)  4                                      (25)       21                                     (14) 7                                (24)      17                                   (16)   8                                 (28) 20  NOTE: This assumes the criteria are weighed equally. If they are not weighted equally (see the values inparentheses), multiply the value in each cell by the weighting for that criteria and total. 3.21.1.  Creation of To-Be Design. Assuming that some changes will be accomplished, the projectteam (often referred to as Design Team(s) in this phase) must understand the performance and processgap between what currently exists and what will need to exist in the To-Be state. To build the To-Bedesign, team members will be required to re-familiarize themselves with the As-Is information toidentify limitations, resources, and the current organization. 3.21.2.  Create To-Be Process/Activity Design. Using the information from opportunity research orimprovement ideas that became obvious during the As-Is mapping of the processes, develop new pro-cess models. Many software programs exist to simulate process flow. This tool can serve as an out-standing method for performing “What if” scenarios. The As-Is data can be used as the baseline. ThenTo-Be improvement changes can be inserted into the model to evaluate the impact of changes onthings like cycle time, manpower requirements, customer wait (queue) times, productivity, etc. Testsites of different process designs can also be set up to provide a more real world simulation of the pro-posed changes. 3.21.2.1.  During the creation of the To-Be state, critical attention needs to be paid to ensure thatappropriate stakeholders and subject matter experts are involved. Lack of MAJCOM and/or unionrepresentation, for example, can cripple or halt the progress of a project of any size. Severalschools of thought exist as to who should be involved in designing the new processes. One recom-mends that the ultimate process owners should design the system they will have to live with.Another argues that having new, more “novice” participants can provide more innovative designs,since they are less likely to be biased by past designs and paradigms. A good rule of thumb is totry to involve a little of both. Have process owners and stakeholders involved, since they knowbest the conditions and restrictions in which the new process will have to perform. Also includeAFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200247customers and outside “fresh eyes” to question any old school assumptions which may emerge,and to more easily provide an “outside the box” perspective. Perhaps representatives from one ofthe benchmark target organizations can participate to provide lessons learned or quick fixes todesign problems that may arise. 3.21.2.2.  Remember to resist the urge to “adopt” techniques or tools identified in the OpportunityResearch phase. No two organizations are the same. Simply introducing telecommuting, peer rat-ings, team-based design, technology insertion, decentralized decision-making or many otherimprovements without considering the unique cultural in the receiving organization can lead tofailure. To re-emphasize: Adapt, don’t adopt opportunity research findings. 3.21.2.3.  Divesting or eliminating processes, activities, or steps in the To-Be design is often not assimple as just making the changes. For projects that impact other organizations or departments,some coordination will need to take place to ensure that these changes do not negatively impactstakeholders. If, for example, the Air Force Corporate Board will be the approving authority of theproposed To-Be design, coordination and agreement between impacted agencies may need to bedemonstrated. Some eliminated activities may be internal or obvious enough to not require suchcoordination. 3.21.3.  Define Interaction of Change Initiatives Across the Five Fronts. Whether the change proposalis a process change, elimination/divestiture of activities, or an initiative that cuts across a number ofprocesses, other areas of the organization will likely be impacted. The interrelation of facilities, poli-cies/guidance, technology, personnel, and process factors needs to be addressed to identify what sup-port factors, for example, will need to change as a result of a process modification. Perhaps careerdevelopment courses (CDC) will need to be revised, new software will be required, just-in-time train-ing will be introduced, and recruitment criteria will need to be adjusted to support a process change. Aworkshop environment may be an ideal place to list such supporting requirements relative to eachchange proposal. A timeline with OPRs and completion dates can be created to help manage theseactivities. It should be obvious how important proper workshop planning becomes in order to ensurerepresentation by appropriate stakeholders and subject matter experts. Union representation may be avery important stakeholder to have involved in this process, when appropriate. 3.21.3.1.  Define New System Requirements. The more detail that can be added to the To-Be orga-nization, the better. Have the Design Team(s) specify skill levels necessary to perform the newactivities or processes. They should also document any software or technology requirements forthe To-Be design. This will assist in establishing the cost of the new system, and will facilitateprocurement and implementation. 3.21.3.2.  Workload Resource Impacts. Any changes to processes/activities will likely impactworkload, and ultimately the manpower authorized to the organization. Typically, if the processchanges are significant, establishing the manpower costs becomes harder. The more mid/long-term the proposed changes/initiatives, the more difficult it becomes to objectively measurethe manpower savings/costs. The proposed manpower requirement becomes “notional,” andshould be based on realistic estimates developed from either a simulation model (see paragraph3.28.3.6.), practical experience, or from opportunity research. 3.21.3.3.  Other Costs. Other resource costs (facilities, technology, etc.) may also be of interest tounderstand and present the To-Be design costs. ABC provides one method for documenting andassigning such costs to process activities. 48AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.21.3.4.  Changes in Manpower Requirements. Define the changes in manpower requirementsresulting from the improvement recommendations. This delta would be based on the To-Be esti-mate minus the As-Is manpower required to perform the event. If detailed As-Is manpower data isavailable, this process will be easier. If none exists or the Team did a higher level costingapproach, then more detailed As-Is manpower data may need to be collected at this time. If neces-sary a formal “notional manpower standard” may need to be developed to outline for the finalapproving authority the processes which will be performed in the future and the manpower “cost”associated with that service. Some political consideration should be made for how to present anycosts or savings. For example, there will often be a transition period when implementing theTo-Be design, during which any manpower savings offered for the To-Be design would not beavailable. If the authorizations are taken off the UMD(s) when the proposed savings are presented,the organization will be without necessary manpower during the transition period. A phasedapproach to adjusting manpower or other resources maybe safer and a more realistic way to ensurethat an organization is able to survive the transition. As discussed, many aspects associated withthe change must be considered to develop the best transition plan, not least of which is the impacton the people (both military and civilian) who would be affected by the change. Some improve-ment recommendations, on the other hand, may lend themselves to immediate adjustment inresources. The sponsor, supported by the study team, briefs the To-Be proposal to the Air ForceCorporate Structure and makes the appropriate recommendation. 3.21.4.  Document New Design. The new design should be documented in a manner that is appropri-ate for the project. Larger projects will require a more formal proposal and plan to be developed forcoordination and approval. Extremely small projects may only require a briefing and verbal approval.Just as in the Project Definition and Planning Phases, it was important that everyone understood thecase for change, scope of the project, and roles/responsibilities. Now it is critical that everyone under-stands how the To-Be organization is being proposed to work. A concept of operations often servesthis purpose, outlining the organizational layout, process designs, and roles and responsibilities of theworkers in the newly proposed process. It defines “Who does what to whom,” and can be as detailedas is reasonable for the project. A simulation model may also serve as a way of articulating the newdesign. 3.21.4.1.  If of interest to the sponsor or the decision making authority, the Implementation Plancan also be developed at this time, outlining key initiatives, actions, OPRs, completion dates, andan overall timeline. As was stated earlier, since the To-Be state does not exist yet, and the To-Bedesign was based to some degree on speculation and assumption, a phased implementationapproach may be appropriate to allow for appropriate adjustments during implementation. Pilottest sites or incremental implementation can serve as this type of “Proof of Concept.” In somecases, there will be recruitment or budgeting lag or a learning curve, which this type of phasedapproach can absorb. 3.21.4.2.  Create measures for evaluating the To-Be organization. So often, organizations do nothave a well-designed measurement program. Measures and metrics frequently exist which provideno real information, and are simply being collected because, “We’ve always measured it.” Thisphase allows the perfect opportunity for an organization to articulate “What must go right” inorder for the organization to survive and be successful. This may be broken down into dimensionsof performance such as “Mission”/“Customer” (effectiveness), “Processes” (efficiency), “Peo-ple,” “Finances,” etc. The sponsor can articulate goals as to what has to happen in each of thesedimensions. Measures are then identified which would give proof of whether or not the goals wereAFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200249being reached. Finally, some method of collection, calculation, data storage, frequency, display,and communication of these measures would need to be defined, with an OPR for each measure.A wealth of performance measurement literature and approaches exists which can help in thedevelopment of such a measurement system. Such measures help future leaders make fact-baseddecisions regarding the “health” of their organization or process. 3.21.5.  Micro. Even a narrow-scoped process requires the sponsor to make a decision about the strat-egy for the To-Be. Considering the breadth of impact is relatively small, and the coordination/approval requirement is lower, deciding and moving forward with the selected option(s) is stream-lined. The To-Be design, whether it is a process or activity, may be created “on the fly” by testing dif-ferent proposed solutions. For example, an Action Work Out can be considered a Micro-scopedproject. This technique conducts the Opportunity Research and To-Be design almost simultaneouslyby physically testing new physical or process designs for improvement as the ideas emerge. In someprojects, the improvement ideas or initiatives may require more planning or design, necessitatingflowcharting, simulation, or other formal design techniques. Even single process or activity improve-ments can significantly impact other factors of the organization, so evaluation of the Five Fronts maystill be appropriate. Due to the reduced coordination/approval requirement, documentation of the newdesign and the resource impacts (manpower, facilities, etc.) may not need to be formally presented tothe ultimate decision maker. If unsure, it is always better to err on the side of too much documentationand justification for proposals. If appropriate, manpower changes may be captured as a variance, if thechange is not Air Force-wide. An implementation plan may also be informal, still ensuring that allimpacted parties understand the proposal, design, and roles/responsibilities in the To-Be design. Pro-cess and activity measures can easily be developed and defined to ensure they are collected and dis-played in a useful manner. 3.21.6.  Mid-level. The To-Be design may impact more organizations and stakeholders, so buy-in forthe new design is more critical. Upon selecting the strategy (option or collection of improvement ini-tiatives), the project sponsor will articulate what the To-Be vision of the organization is. This will pro-vide some clarity on what the Design Teams should develop, and will provide boundaries on how theTo-Be data should be presented for approval by the decision-making authority. Change initiativesshould be assigned to the Design Team or Teams for development. The team(s) may wish to conductworkshops to create new designs or propose the plan to eliminate/divest selected activities. If appro-priate, the new organizational structure should be defined, processes should be flowcharted or mod-eled, and resource impacts should be estimated. Encourage stakeholders to participate or reviewdesign ideas for buy-in and innovation purposes. If technology insertion is involved, requirements forthat technology should be defined. The Five Fronts should be formally considered for each improve-ment idea, with a final review of issues, which may cut across a number of processes. If the projectspans across many departments, bases, MAJCOMs, etc., ensure that assumptions and design propos-als are being communicated as appropriate. As more processes and initiatives are impacted by change,there will likely be a manpower impact. A mid-level scoped project may require the ultimate approv-ing authority to be more senior, thus requiring more detailed data on cost. If the costing detail from theAs-Is Phase was very high level, it may be necessary to measure in more detail the As-Is cost now thatthe improvement targets have been identified. This will allow for more sound estimates of To-Becosts. Improvement initiatives can be described by their implementation time (e.g., short term/longterm improvements). Longer-term improvements will require more notional estimates of both costsand benefits, and may require a phased implementation. A more formal Concept of Operations andImplementation Plan will likely be necessary to ensure that the wider scope of the organization50AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002impacted by the changes understands the proposals and their responsibilities in the To-Be state.Finally, with input from the sponsor, the Design Team can define and develop the performance mea-sures which will measure the health of the To-Be organization. Dimensions of performance can bedefined, as described above, and performance goals regarding “What must happen” in the respectivedimension can be articulated. Process owners are often great participants in the activity of identifyingthe few measures which demonstrate accomplishment of the goals. 3.21.7.  Macro. High coordination/communication will require the change initiatives to be more for-mally documented. Even “quick wins” should be captured, especially if they impact other processesor will be expected to be implemented at other locations. The project sponsor(s) will still need toestablish criteria for selecting options or change initiatives. Due to the larger scope, they may wish toorganize the change proposals into short-term/mid-term/long-term activities, to allow the ultimatedecision-making authority to consider the budgeting cycle and a phased implementation. Themacro-scoped project also impacts a greater portion of the organization which increases the impor-tance of having representatives from all appropriate areas of the organization participate in the DesignTeams. These experts will provide valuable data for estimating firm and notional manpower, support,and other appropriate costs associated with the changes. ABC and simulation modeling are valuabletechniques for rigorously creating such information. The process/activity/initiative designs must con-sider the Five Fronts, since a project of this scale will likely have a ripple effect and impact many pro-cesses and organizations for every change that is made. Large, organizational proposals, such aschanges to career field progression, modification of policy and guidance, and standardization ofequipment will likely emerge, and must be addressed and managed. The Concept of Operations andImplementation Plan should also be developed with appropriate representation from across the appro-priate divisions, functions, MAJCOMs, departments, etc. Buy-in is critical to moving the proposedTo-Be design forward. The sponsor should have an idea of the necessary format, concerns, partici-pants, and time frame which will increase the likelihood of approval by the ultimate decision-makingauthority. Finally, the Design Team should take the time to identify the Performance Measures bywhich the To-Be organization can be monitored. These measures would be separate from measuressimply depicting the progress of implementation. The measures developed for the To-Be organizationshould be a “Scorecard” by which the To-Be leaders can monitor how well the organization is doingwhat needs to be done in order to accomplish its “mission.” If the project organization has MissionEssential Tasks, some of these measures should directly reflect the Performance Measures it identifiedfor the “Assess” phase of Functional Management. Other measures may also be necessary to monitorthe internal efficiency of the organization outside what the Performance Management frameworkrequires. 3.22.  Process Oriented Description (POD) Development.  3.22.1.  General Concepts. The POD is a full description of processes that are the responsibility of thework center. A process is a series of value-added actions that bring about an end or result. If a PODdoes not exist, develop one from process analysis worksheets, mission statements, and/or the applica-ble directives that govern the function and define work requirements. The POD is the basic buildingblock of a standard and is written to facilitate work measurement and data analysis and computations.Functional characteristics, such as complexity, stability, and degree of standardization influence thelevel of POD detail, the selection of the measurement approach, and the ultimate maintenance of thestandard. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002513.22.2.  Definition of Work Center Process Steps. Make sure POD content reflects only mis-sion-essential processes assigned to the work center being studied that are governed by a MAJCOMdirective or higher. Omit assumed or inferred workload. Inferred work is work that is the responsibil-ity of another work center or function. Assumed work is considered nice-to-do but is not necessary towork center productivity. Inferred and assumed work are not given manpower credit to the work cen-ter under study. To build a good POD, develop an accurate and understandable definition for each pro-cess step. 3.22.2.1.  A process is a discrete segment of work activities that represents a composite of meth-ods, procedures, and techniques needed to accomplish one unit of work activity (output). It is aprocedure with a definitive input and output product. This facilitates price identification andexamination of various levels of service options. A process involves worker interaction with suchthings as equipment, material, other people, and information. In most instances, the performanceof a process by a worker has a definite beginning and end. 3.22.2.2.  A process definition may only need a short phrase (for example, repairs carburetor), orit may need a breakout of the process into several steps (for example, disassembles carburetor,replaces part, reassembles carburetor, and inspects carburetor). Factors that influence the degreeof definition detail needed are: 3.22.3.  The Nature of the Activity. 3.22.3.1.  A detailed process definition is suitable when an operation is highly repetitive and a spe-cific sequence of steps must be followed. 3.22.3.2.  A less detailed listing of a process is suitable when a process can be done in a variety ofways. For example, management, research, and problem-solving activities may follow differentsteps each time they are done; therefore, they can only be described in general terms. 3.22.3.3.  Structure processes so they are independent and mutually exclusive of each other andhave definite beginning and ending points. 3.22.4.  The work measurement method selected: 3.22.4.1.  A measurement method such as operational audit usually needs processes defined at thestep level to ensure accuracy of data. 3.22.4.2.  For work sampling, the sampling level dictates the degree of detail needed. If samplingis done at the process level, a listing of step titles or a grouping of the steps in sentence format mayprovide enough detail for measurement. 3.22.4.3.  In all cases, clearly write process definitions in enough detail so the measuring techni-cian can easily identify when an activity occurs during measurement. 3.22.4.4.  Setting up the correct process definition detail is a repetitive procedure requiring themanpower and organizational technician to use good judgment and common sense. Each workcenter produces different definition requirements that must be addressed to obtain accurate data.During this procedure, remember: 3.22.4.4.1.  Steps made purposely broad to cover as much work as possible can increase inter-pretation problems, cause inaccurate measurement, and hinder data analysis. 52AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.22.4.4.2.  Steps that do not accurately reflect duties and responsibilities increase the chancefor inaccurate measurement. 3.22.4.4.3.  Steps that are too detailed may result in an indiscernible sequence of events. 3.22.5.  Classifying Work Center Activities. When analyzing individual work center activities, decideif they are productive, nonavailable, assumed work, or not allowed. Use Table 3.2. to do this analysis. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200253Table 3.2.  How To Classify Work.I.

Include steps required to satisfy all currency requirements. Consider the steps credited in the SIAM or MAF. If travel is required to accomplish a direct process, establish a step in the process for travel. If travel is required to do two or more steps in the same direct process, establish a separate step for each time travel is performed (see note 1). Establish a process called "Management" that contains those steps necessary to support subordinate work centers.  Consider tasks credited in the SIAM for OA studies. Credit this work to the direct process done. Consider tasks credited in the SIAM for OA studies. Consider as nonproductive unless used in conjunction with rule 6 or 7. Consider tasks credited in the SIAM for OA studies. Give no credit because this is considered loaned time. 10 Cleanup 11 NOTES: 1. Ensure credit for travel is not double-counted in the steps or processes identified. When the modular equation or process oriented approach is used, split travel between the appropriate modules or processes. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002552. Indirect tasks can be reflected as both direct or indirect in Management or overhead work centers. However, when documented as direct work, the processes reflect steps to support personnel in subordinate work centers while the indirect categories reflect steps to support people inside the overhead work center. Ensure that direct processes are written clearly and do not duplicate indirect work described in AFMS 00AA. 3. There may be other duties performed by work center personnel, e.g., snow/ice removal, that may or may not be creditable to the work center. In all cases, use the decision logic table (Table 3.2.) to determine how this work should be classified. 3.22.6.  Nonavailable Work Center Activities. 3.22.6.1.  When identifying and defining processes done in a work center, there are activities thatare directed, approved, or recognized by the Air Force that makes people unavailable for assignedprimary processes. Since these activities have an impact on all work centers, they have been mea-sured Air Force-wide and subtracted from each person’s assigned time to produce the man-houravailability factors (MAF). MAFs are listed in AFI 38-201. 3.22.6.2.  The major groupings of nonavailable activities for military personnel are leave, perma-nent change of station (PCS)-related, medical, organizational duties, education and training, andmiscellaneous. Specific definitions of each follow: 3.22.6.2.1.  Leave. This refers to an approved absence from work or duty for a specified periodof time. It does not include leave taken in conjunction with a PCS move or convalescent leave.Personnel on leave in conjunction with a PCS move are assigned against authorizations in theAir Force Transient Account. 3.22.6.2.2.

The major groupings of nonavailable activities for civil-ian personnel are leave and training. 3.22.6.2.5.6.1.  Leave. This refers to an approved absence from work or duty for aspecified period of time. This includes annual leave, sick leave, and special absences. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002573.22.6.2.5.6.1.1.  Annual Leave. Employees are granted leave to allow time off forvacations and for personal and emergency purposes. 3.22.6.2.5.6.1.2.  Sick Leave. Sick leave is a qualified right of the employee andmay be used only for the following absences: (1) when incapacitated for perfor-mance of duty by sickness, injury, pregnancy, or illness resulting from immuniza-tions or vaccinations; (2) for medical, dental, or optical examinations or treatment;and (3) to participate in drug or alcohol counseling programs. Additionally, theFamily Friendly Leave Act allows sick leave to be used to care for a family mem-ber with an illness, injury, or a dental, medical, or optical examination/treatmentand to make arrangements for or to attend the funeral of a family member. 3.22.6.2.5.6.1.3.  Special Absences. These include absences during normal dutyhours that are administratively authorized without loss of pay and without chargeto leave. These absences are described in a minimum of two publications: 3.22.6.2.5.6.1.3.1.  AFI 36-701, Labor Management Relations. 3.22.6.2.5.6.1.3.2.  Federal Personnel Manual, Supplement 990-2, Sub-chapter11, Excused Absences. 3.22.6.2.5.6.2.  Training. Includes time for formal and recurring training. 3.22.6.2.5.6.2.1.  Formal Training. This includes all formal classroom training ofeight hours duration or longer that is recorded on an individual’s master personnelrecord. It excludes OJT, but includes courses given on base that meet the formaleight-hour criteria. 3.22.6.2.5.6.2.2.  Recurring Training. This includes any training that is of an ancil-lary or mandatory nature required to ensure Air Force civilian personnel possess anadequate blend of both general and technical knowledge and capabilities. Someexamples of recurring training are operations security (OPSEC), communicationssecurity (COMSEC), base orientation briefings, and supervisor's safety training. 3.22.6.2.5.7.  Operational Audit. Nonavailable activities are not measured during an oper-ational audit (OA) study because they are accounted for in the MAFs. Work samplingaccounts for all man-hours including nonavailable activities; however, the resulting non-available man-hours are subtracted and not used in the man-hour equation. 3.22.6.2.5.8.  POD. Nonavailable activities are not put in the POD. 3.22.6.2.5.9.  Additional Information. For more information about nonavailable activitiesaddressed in the MAF, see copies of military and civilian man-hour availability studiesdistributed to all manpower organizations by AFMIA. 3.22.7.  Preparation of the POD. 3.22.7.1.  Clearly state process titles and accurately describe the steps that are grouped underthem. Use a noun form or an adjective and a noun form (for example, management, minor mainte-nance, officer classification, record processing). Make the process titles descriptive and easilyidentifiable. 58AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.22.7.2.  State step titles in a single unit form with verbs in third person singular. Processes willbe described at the step level only (e.g., 1.1., 1.2., 2.3., etc.). In work sampling measurement, pro-cesses will be described to the level necessary for accurate measurement. In either case, eachdefinitive step of the process, from the beginning (input) to the end (output), will be described inthe sequence that it occurs in the process. This increases the chances of getting accurate unit timesand frequencies at the time of measurement. Titles that are vague or written in plural form increasethe chance of error in the associated unit time values and may make later analysis of data harder.The same step title may be used in different processes. For example, "Reviews UMD" could be astep in processing a manpower authorization change request or in the process of applying a man-power standard. Examples of acceptable and unacceptable step titles are listed below. ACCEPTABLE                        UNACCEPTABLE Types letterInspects facilityAttends meetingPrepares Report No. 1Repairs pumpTakes sample Type letters  Perform inspections  Attend meetings  Prepare reports  Repair pumps  Take samples 3.22.7.3.  Including an indirect statement in the POD is optional. If it is included, use the followingstatement: INDIRECT: Indirect work involves those tasks that are not readily identifiable with thework center’s specific product or service. The major categories of standard indirect work are:Administers Civilian, Officer, and Enlisted Personnel; Directs Work Center Activity; ProvidesAdministrative Support; Prepares for and Conducts/Attends Meeting; Administers Training; Man-ages Supplies; Maintains Equipment; and Performs Cleanup. See AFMS 00AA, Standard IndirectDescription. 3.22.7.4.  Format the POD using the AFMIA home page, Air Force Manpower Standards, TechGuidance and Forms, Air Force Manpower Standards Publishing Guide.

The standard workload factor (WLF) is the factor selected to predict afunction’s manpower requirement for various workload volumes. Selection of the WLF begins withthe identification of potential workload factors (PWLF) during study planning and measurementactivities. The identification of PWLFs begins with work unit (WU) identification. WUs are the quan-tifiable outputs of work activities or processes, e.g., an engine repaired. The selected WLF may be aWU, if its volume is not controlled by the function (external WLF), e.g., square feet of floor spacemaintained. The WLF will also be programmable, or must describe workload not under the control ofthe function being studied. Programmable workload factors include (1) base population, (2) numberof authorized aircraft, space based systems supported, or vehicles supported, (3) mission designseries, (4) flying hours, and (5) students. Obtain waivers to these criteria from HQ USAF/XPM. 3.23.2.  Identifying Work Units (WUs). Study the functional structure to identify significant processesand the output products or units of production. The main purpose of this step is to set the stage forpicking PWLFs. 3.23.2.1.  Where feasible, identify work units for each defined work activity or process that allowsa good look at like-activity time variances during analysis and computations. 3.23.2.2.  To be of maximum utility, work units should be: 3.23.2.2.1.  Directly related to the time and effort spent on the associated activity. 3.23.2.2.2.  Economical and convenient to report and use. 3.23.2.2.3.  Mutually exclusive, so that no item is counted under more than one work unit. 3.23.2.2.4.  Open to audit, so that the accuracy of a work count is readily verified through set-ting up a work count system or through existing internal work measurement programs or man-agement information systems. 3.23.2.2.5.  Readily understood by those who plan, schedule, and control the work. 3.23.2.2.6.  Readily identifiable when seen produced. 62AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.23.2.2.7.  Individually standardized in terms of the procedures needed for accomplishment. 3.23.2.3.  Depending on the established or intended use of the work unit, each of the aboveattributes assumes a varying degree of importance. The most important characteristic of a workunit is that it must define a specific amount of work. Vague work unit titles should be avoided. 3.23.2.4.  WUs can be used as WLFs in ratio type standards and are normally reserved for singlelocation or small population standards. They are not used in standards unless they are programma-ble, or not under control of the function (external WLF). 3.23.3.  Identifying Potential Workload Factors. An ideal workload factor has two significantattributes: 3.23.3.1.  It relates to manpower requirements to the extent that any change in the value of the fac-tor produces a corresponding change in the man-hours needed to do the work. 3.23.3.2.  The value of the factor can be predicted for future time periods to make the standard use-ful as a forecasting tool. 3.23.4.  Relatability and Predictability. The relative importance of these two attributes –relatabilityand predictability - can be debated. But, if a stated manpower requirement is based on a workload fac-tor that does not relate to that requirement, then a standard manpower relationship does not exist. As aresult, standard predictability and credibility are undermined. 3.23.5.  Identifying Relatability and Predictability. Identify the predictability of a factor by studyingthe available program information. Relatability presents a more difficult problem because accuratedata for correlation analysis is rarely available this early in the study. For this reason, the best work-load factors are normally identified only after measurement. The selection problem is compounded bythe relationship that often exists between accuracy and programmability. With a highly finite, pre-cisely defined unit, there is a high probability of correlation, but the chance of predicting the futureworkload volume is usually small. As the definition of the unit is broadened, the chance of accuratelypredicting the future volume increases, but the chances of getting an acceptable degree of correlationgoes down. 3.23.6.  Determining Relationships. The problem in determining relationships between workload andman-hours is less where there are existing resource management systems, output measurement pro-grams, or management information systems. This information can help M&O personnel select work-load factors. 3.23.7.  Procedures for Identifying Potential Workload Factors. Workload factors should be bothaccurate and programmable. Factors that are also used for programming are preferred over those thatare not. If there is a significant difference in relatability, do not give up accuracy for programmabilityin setting the basic standard. When it is needed, a separate equation can be built for programming themanpower requirements. Identify potential workload factors for measurement using these procedures: 3.23.7.1.  First, identify WUs not controlled by the function. 3.23.7.2.  Second, from these WUs, identify those that are associated with major manpower con-suming activities or processes. 3.23.7.3.  Third, identify factors that are not WUs, e.g., base population. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002633.23.7.4.  Finally, eliminate factors that are not readily identifiable or easily counted. Counts of thePWLFs and other WUs can be made during familiarization or measurement. 3.23.8.  Use Accurate Terms. Use terms that give actual experience, and not programmable workload,when making the final list of PWLFs. For example, use assigned strength (not authorized strength) forpopulation factors; and hours flown (not hours programmed) for flying hour factors; or munitionsstored, not storage capacity. Get actual workload experience for both man-hours and workloads to seeif a true relationship exists. 3.23.9.  Get the following information for each PWLF picked through the above process. The sameformat applies to work units. 3.23.9.1.  Title. Identify briefly what is to be counted. Use singular form--i.e., "A VehicleRepaired"--not "Vehicles repaired." 3.23.9.2.  Definition. Define, in precise terms, the count and tell what is to be included in orexcluded from the count. Vague definitions are not acceptable. For example, if "PopulationServed" is the workload factor, it must be clear whether the count includes tenants, on-base popu-lation, off-base population, transients, Reserves, National Guard, Individual Mobilization Aug-mentees, etc. 3.23.9.3.  Source and Method of Count. Identify the source from which the count is to be obtained.This includes the report number and title and column number or title. Include the date or edition ofthe report since the format of the source might change. 3.23.9.4.  Rationale. Include the reasons for selecting work units or workload factors. Tell howand why the selected work units or workload factors are expected to relate to the measuredman-hours. 3.23.9.5.  Method of Verification. Identify the source used to verify the data included in the pri-mary source of count. This includes multiples of sources used to derive the cumulative count doc-umented in the primary source. 3.23.10.  Program Terminology. After selecting the standard WLF in later study phases, revise thepreceding to show program terminology when pertinent. For example: 3.23.10.1.  Build Manpower Standards Using Actual Workload Factor Counts. Manpower stan-dards using actual measured man-hours must be built on actual workload factor counts, e.g.,assigned personnel or assigned vehicles, not authorized or required quantities. Authorizations orrequirements do not produce work and are not logically relatable to actual measured man-hours. 3.23.10.2.  If the selected workload factor title is "A Student Trained in the Manpower & Organi-zation Course," the workload factor title for the standard might be "A Student Programmed to beTrained in the Manpower & Organization Course." 3.23.10.3.  If the selected workload factor title is "A Person Assigned to Base Supply," the work-load factor title for the standard might be "A Base Supply Person Required After Application ofBase Supply Manpower Standards," or "A Base Supply Authorization." Do not revise workloadfactor titles based on population to Requirements in the UMD, since they may include activereserve forces, individual mobilization augmentees, and authorizations earned as a result ofhost-tenant support agreements. 3.23.11.  Planning a Work Count System: 64AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.23.11.1.  Make a list of WUs and PWLFs needed for a work count. 3.23.11.2.  Find out which of those items are adequately reported by existing management report-ing or information systems. 3.23.11.3.  See if the existing instructions are being followed IAW with functional OPR directives.Local compliance with reporting instructions is essential if using existing systems. 3.23.11.4.  See whether or not the items needed are reported in defined form and for compatibletime periods. If the reported information differs only slightly from what is needed, consider work-ing with the OPR to decide if it is more economical to change the existing report or redefine theitems reported. Do not set up additional systems unless it is essential to standards development. 3.23.11.5.  Use the following to get usable and accurate work counts: 3.23.11.5.1.  Show clearly what is a unit of count. 3.23.11.5.2.  Set up the source of count, or the point in a process, at which a unit of countresults. 3.23.11.5.3.  Make sure that the length of count reporting is compatible with, or adjustable to,the measurement period’s anticipated length. This is especially important if the work samplingmethod is used. 3.23.11.5.4.  Set up safeguards that minimize the possibility of a duplicated or missed count.An example is a random external audit of the workload reports. 3.23.11.5.5.  When possible, have the work count procedures call for a minimum of six monthshistorical data. This historical information is of value later in the computation phase when rep-resentativeness of the measurement period is evaluated. 3.23.12.  Potential Equivalent Workload Factors. Consider the use of equivalent WLFs if they are suit-able for the work center. 3.23.12.1.  An equivalent WLF is used to get a count for similar work that has different per accom-plishment times (PAT). For example, the WLF "vehicle maintained" may have equivalents forpreventative maintenance on a sedan or on a truck. 3.23.12.2.  When this kind of WLF is used, a baseline output is valued at one, (in this case thesedan is given a 1.0) and the other outputs are valued in relation to this baseline (for example, thetruck could be given a 1.2). 3.23.12.3.  The total WLF count is obtained by adding all equivalents (for example, (10 X 1.0) +(5 X 1.2) = 16.0). 3.23.12.4.  Identify potential equivalent WLFs early in a study. Then design data collection toallow validation of equivalent values. Work measurement results should support relative values.In the vehicle example, measurement data shows 20 percent more man-hours needed to service atruck than a sedan. Remember, the time value in your measurement (PAT) must be the same for allvehicles used in the equivalent, and it must be equal to the baseline output (in this case the sedan).This is necessary because you are adjusting the workload factor value to compensate for the differ-ences in time needed to service the sedan and the truck. 3.24.  Measurement Design.  AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002653.24.1.  General Concepts. Measurement design is a coordinated effort needing full participation andteamwork from all levels. Once you’ve selected your measurement approach you can begin to preparefor measurement. There are many different techniques available for collecting data. However, thereare really only two approaches: (1) workshop measurement and (2) field measurement. Regardless ofthe approach selected, some form of study plan is required. A workshop approach may require a lessdetailed one, but will require an extensive familiarization package for the workshop attendees. On theother hand, field measurement will require a very detailed study plan because persons other thanproject team members (for example, manpower technicians at other locations) may be conducting theactual data collection or measurement. 3.24.2.  Major Activities. Following are some major design activities. Depending on the approach,some or all may be required. 3.24.2.1.  Briefing study background and planned approach with functional OPR. 3.24.2.2.  Identifying project team members from M&O and functional communities. 3.24.2.3.  Conducting a comprehensive review of work processes and activities. Identifyingimprovement initiatives and work outputs. 3.24.2.4.  Identifying potential variances (mission, technological, or environmental). 3.24.2.5.  Identifying test measurement or preworkshop visit locations. 3.24.2.6.  Briefing local OPRs at test measurement or preworkshop visit sites on study back-ground, approach and needs, and collecting data. 3.24.2.7.  Developing the final detailed study plan to include data collection instructions. 3.24.2.8.  Notifying the Chief, Civilian Personnel Flight to inform union officials of studyprogress, if the study involves civilian positions or processes. 3.24.3.  Measurement Plan and Input Team Measurement Instructions. 3.24.3.1.  Part One - Measurement Plan. 3.24.3.1.1.  Field measurement will be the exception. If the project team chooses thisapproach, instead of conducting a workshop, they must develop a formal measurement plan. Ifthey developed the study plan, they may use the process described below for measurementplan development (see Figure 3.14.). 3.24.3.1.2.  The project team should conduct a test measurement to determine the validity ofthe test measurement plan. After test measurement, the project team updates the measurementdesign based on test measurement results. Part One of the study plan becomes Part One of themeasurement plan. The team sends it to the input teams and affected MAJCOMs. (NLT twoweeks before work measurement). 3.24.3.2.  Part Two - Input Team Measurement Instructions. The measurement instructions andPOD in this part represent the heart of the measurement plan. Section A of the measurement planis general information, which is common to all work centers being measured. The remaining sec-tions contain specific measurement instructions for each work center. For example, if three workcenters are being measured, include sections B, C, and D (one for each). If measuring only one,don’t divide Part Two into sections; however, include each applicable topic shown in Figure 3.14. 66AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.24.3.2.1.  Section A - General Information. Give clear and concise measurement instructionsto input teams. Do not merely repeat information from this manual. Tell them how to measurethe function. 3.24.3.2.1.1.  Work Sampling. Address familiarization sampling, backlogged work, bor-rowed and loaned man-hours, start and stop days for sampling, usable sampling daysneeded, stratified-by-hour or random-by-day sampling, sampling lunch, nonavailabletime, nonproductive time and special processes, treatment of travel, indirect categories,absences from the work area, work not done during the sampling period, assumed orinferred work, collocated work centers, shifts or sections having fewer than five peopleassigned, sampling days falling outside control limits, and supplementary measurementmethod used and the processes or steps that will be measured by this method.

Operational Audit (OA). State the technique to measure frequencies andper-accomplishment times. Relate frequencies to work unit counts where possible. Aninterview worksheet may be used for collecting OA data instead of a preprinted AF Form1040, Operational Audit Data (see AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2). If used, interview work-sheets should include information necessary for the input teams to collect and verify data,and for the study or input team to input data directly into the computer. Furnish benchmarktimes and data ranges when available. 3.24.3.2.1.3.  Workload Data Collection. Include only general workload collection instruc-tions that pertain to all work centers being measured in this section. Put specific workloadcollection instructions in Attachment 1 to the measurement plan. 3.24.3.2.1.4.  Standard Indirect Allowed Man-hours (SIAM). State which SIAM task timevalues will be used for operational audits and indicate which indirect tasks will be mea-sured. Instruct field measurement sites to use the measurement instructions furnished inAFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, for measuring these indirect tasks. 3.24.3.2.1.5.  Strength Data. State the need for current or historical authorized andassigned strength data. This data may be needed for a potential workload factor (PWLF) ina work center, for comparison against measured requirements, or analyzing changingworkload. See paragraph 3.23. for further information regarding PWLFs. 3.24.3.2.1.6.  Skill and Grade Instructions. List the data necessary for the project team todo skill and grade analysis for completion of the manpower table. Tell the input teams tocollect skill and grade data for inclusion in the measurement report. 3.24.3.2.2.  Section B - Specific Information (by Work Center). This section is for each spe-cific work center. For example, if three work centers are being measured, include a section B,C, and D (one for each). 3.24.3.2.2.1.  POD. Prepare PODs according to instructions in paragraph 3.22. 3.24.3.2.2.2.  Statement of Conditions (SOC). The SOC paragraph describes, in generalterms, conditions which bear on development or application of the manpower standard.The SOC will later be used in preparation of the manpower standard. Include key assump-tions and major decisions on modes of operation not described in the POD. It is also thebaseline against which potential variances are analyzed. The SOC in the standard describesthe general conditions that are incorporated into the standard. Some condition classeswhich could impact a work center are: 3.24.3.2.2.2.1.  Climatic Conditions. This condition covers those naturally occurringatmospheric conditions that affect the work. For example, extreme temperatures mayaffect the work, by snowfall, or by the corrosive effect of rain and humidity. 3.24.3.2.2.2.2.  Physical Layout of Facilities. This condition highlights facility layoutsituations that affect the work. Among the items looked at are the degree of consolida-tion of the work center and how the work is affected by the organization of people,equipment, and workflow. 3.24.3.2.2.2.3.  Physical Condition of Facilities. This condition describes physical con-ditions of the facilities that affect work. While all work centers are indirectly affectedby conditions in this class, you will find that some work centers such as laboratories,68AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002computer rooms, etc., can be directly affected by them. It is only to such cases that thiscondition class applies, e.g., age of facilities, quality of facilities, controllable workcenter environment. Do things like heating, air conditioning, and lighting affect thework? 3.24.3.2.2.2.4.  Nonautomated tools and equipment. This condition covers specifictools and equipment, except for automated equipment or computers that are critical todoing the work. 3.24.3.2.2.2.5.  Automated Capabilities. This condition deals with automated equip-ment that has replaced or enhanced manual ways of doing work. 3.24.3.2.2.2.6.  Directed Performance Standards. This condition covers situationswhere how often work is done or how long it takes to do the work is directed by MAJ-COM or HQ USAF regulation or policy. It includes where a given level of manpoweris set up independent of work volume. 3.24.3.2.2.2.7.  Wartime Conditions. This condition covers wartime conditions thataffect work. For example, a need to wear special protective gear during nuclear, bio-logical, or chemical attack might increase the amount of time needed to do work oraffect how, or how often, some tasks are done. 3.24.3.2.2.3.  Determining Applicability. Once you have identified the kinds of conditionsthat affect the work in each condition class, you will decide whether each of these condi-tions applies to every location or only to some of the locations. 3.24.3.2.2.4.  Work Measurement Instructions. Describe specific work measurementinstructions peculiar to each work center in these sections. Do not repeat the general mea-surement instructions in Section A. 3.24.3.3.  Part Three - Measurement Report Format and Instructions: 3.24.3.3.1.  Tailor the content of the measurement report to the needs of the study. Limit themeasurement report to minimum essential data. Furnish a table of contents listing the data col-lection forms, work measurement forms, skill and grade data, etc. 3.24.3.3.2.  Specify data submission by the most expedient means. Maximize the use ofe-mail. Include email addresses for the study team. Set suspense dates as the latest day infor-mation must be sent. 3.24.3.4.  Part Four - Bibliography and Glossary. 3.24.3.4.1.  List functional publications that form the basis for functional mission require-ments. 3.24.3.4.2.  The input technician is not expected to be intimately familiar with unique func-tional terms and acronyms. Therefore, check the POD and identify terms and acronyms thatmust be defined in the glossary. List terms in alphabetical order. 3.24.3.5.  Attachments to the Plan. 3.24.3.5.1.  List all potential WLFs needing data collection. State the title, definition, source ofcount, and rationale for each potential WLF. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002693.24.3.5.1.1.  Title. Identify briefly what to count. Use singular form, i.e., "A VehicleRepaired", not "Vehicles Repaired." 3.24.3.5.1.2.  Definition. Define the count in precise terms and tell what to include orexclude from the count. Vague definitions are not acceptable. For example, if "PopulationServed" is a potential workload factor, it must be clear whether the count includes tenants,on-base population, off-base population, transients, etc. 3.24.3.5.1.3.  Source and Method of Count. Identify the source from which the count is tobe obtained. Be sure to include all information which could be used in identifying where,when, and what data is to be collected. Make sure the instructions will achieve the desiredresults by testing them. Tell how to record data when the count is zero or nonavailable. 3.24.3.5.1.4.  Rationale. Include the reasons for selecting work units or workload factors.Tell how and why the selected work units or workload factors are expected to relate to themeasured man-hours. 3.24.3.5.1.5.  Method of Verification. Identify the source used to verify the data includedin the primary source of count. This includes multiple sources used to derive the cumula-tive count documented in the primary source. 3.25.  Work Measurement.  3.25.1.  Major Activities. Following are some potential major measurement activities. Depending onyour approach, some or all may be required. 3.25.1.1.  Briefing the work center personnel about the measurement and the need for their partic-ipation. 3.25.1.2.  Measuring work and collecting workload data according to measurement instructionsfor the basic standard. Also, measuring and collecting data for any variances. 3.25.1.3.  Examining measurement results to make sure measured and collected data are accurateand show work center requirements. 3.25.1.4.  Briefing measurement report findings to base functional OPR. 3.25.1.5.  Coordinating the measurement report findings with the MAJCOM OPR. 3.25.2.  Measurement Approach. 3.25.2.1.  The study team needs to select the most suitable approach for obtaining the minimumessential data to be used to compute manpower requirements. The goal should be to use the leastexpensive approach that will produce acceptably valid and representative data within the shortesttime. This will pave the way to cooperatively produce quality manpower standard tools in a moreresponsive time, at a significantly lower cost. 3.25.2.2.  The study team must first decide if it is necessary, or even possible to use work measure-ment techniques to get all or part of the needed data. Work measurement costs time, money, andkeeps everyone involved from doing alternative work. Carefully consider the decision to use workmeasurement. Development of a functional model (AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2) may be anacceptable and economical approach when work measurement is not deemed necessary or possi-ble. 70AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.25.2.3.  Work measurement techniques may be used through field measurement, workshops orboth. Both approaches have pros and cons. Generally, workshop measurement has been accept-able to both functional and manpower communities because it has been shown to produce qualityproducts with less cost and time. Many work measurement methods work very effectively andefficiently when done in a properly constituted and well-run workshop. A combination of coremodeling, flow and process charting and operational audit can be successfully done by workshopto develop a MEO, the associated manpower standards and level of service options. Some limitedfield measurement can be used to validate workshop products. The key to developing qualityproducts at minimal cost is to have the full participation of the pertinent functional and manpowerrepresentatives at every stage, including the workshop. Staffing, as well, should be expedited to asuccessful and more timely conclusion. Field measurement very often incurs the greatest overallcosts, takes the longest time and frequently encounters prolonged staffing. Consequently, caremust be taken to select the correct approach, use the right tools and show their benefits and rele-vance to the functional representatives. Again, it must be a mutual decision to balance the cost andvalue added by the different measurement options. 3.25.3.  Work Measurement Locations. Use the following if on-site measurement is necessary: 3.25.3.1.  Select representative locations for work measurement and data collection. If test mea-surement will be used, select the test measurement site. If the workshop OA measurementapproach is used, be sure the workshop participants are "representative" of the locations or units towhich the subsequent standard will apply. 3.25.3.2.  Select a sample of these locations to make sure data will incorporate high, medium, andlow workload volumes and represent work center conditions. The number of locations included inthe measurement depends on the size of the population. Table 3.4. gives suggested sample sizesfor the population to be covered by the standard. Avoid additional locations since the extra timeand cost usually only delay the study effort. Table 3.4.  Minimum Number of Locations. RULE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B If the total number of locations in the population is then the minimum number of locations to be used in a standard study is 1 - 3 4 - 6 7 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 21 22 - 33 34 - 63 64 - 100 101 - more all 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10% of total 3.25.3.3.  Omit locations scheduled for a cost comparison study during the same period. Also omitlocations where the function remained in-house as a result of a cost comparison study. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002713.25.3.4.  Get OPR concurrence on the type of locations needed (mission, geographic area, size,etc.) rather than limiting the need to specific bases. 3.25.3.5.  Coordinate with the respective MAJCOM headquarters to find the earliest date inputteams would be available to participate. See AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, for definition of inputteam. Based on this date, set the measurement start date for the study. Other factors affecting thisdate are: 3.25.3.5.1.  The time needed by the study team to complete measurement design. 3.25.3.5.2.  Changes planned for the work center. Make sure the functional OPR understandsthe impact any changes in work center tasks or workload factors have on study findings. Ifchanges are major and unavoidable, delay the start date for the study. 3.25.4.  Staffing Needs. Consider coordination, staffing, and approval needs as defined in the studycontract. In functions with decentralized management and control, increased involvement at lowerechelons is necessary. The project team must know the coordination role of each level in the func-tional community in order to plan the associated milestones. 3.25.5.  Standard Development Workshop. If used, the project team leader should be the facilitator orarrange to have a qualified facilitator for the workshop and the functional point of contact (POC) aschairperson. The chairperson makes sure the workshop is conducted in a professional manner andobjectives are met. 3.25.6.  Workload Collection. 3.25.6.1.  The project team identifies workload collection needs. They include data collectioninstructions in the familiarization package when requesting functional representatives bring datato the workshop. For field measurements, the project team collects historical workload volume forthe period specified. They also start a collection system to accurately capture the historical andcurrent workload when such a system does not exist. Report workload data on a general-purposeform or comparable computerized format. 3.25.6.2.  Data collection starts at the direction of the project team and continues until told to stop.Collection continues until enough data is available for standard application. 3.25.6.3.  The project team decides whether to revise an existing reporting system or institute anew report. After data analysis and computations, a functional report control symbol (RCS) isassigned for workload data reporting. If the OPR must set up a new RCS report, the project teamwill furnish help to ensure the new report gives adequate information for workload data reporting. 3.25.7.  Field Measurement. Field measurement sites conduct measurement according to the methodand instructions specified by the study team. Notify the project team immediately if difficulties areencountered or work requirements are identified which are not in the POD and have not been identi-fied for variance development. Inaccurate data results from failure to follow the instructions or frommaking assumptions when the instructions do not cover a given situation. Measure and document con-troversial steps separately until the issue is resolved. Special measurement considerations follow. 3.25.7.1.  Personal, Fatigue, and Delay Allowances. When using work sampling or good operatortiming, the normal time to do an operation does not include allowances for the workers’ personalneeds, rest, or work interruptions that are beyond the workers’ control. These measurement meth-ods and techniques are based on statistical accuracy and are designed to measure the amount of72AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002time associated with the process or step. In these cases, apply allowances to find the allowed time.Allowances are classified as personal, fatigue, and unavoidable delay. Instructions for computingallowances are in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2. Generally, the project team identifies the relevantallowances and includes them in the measurement plan. 3.25.7.2.  Indirect Work. The primary means of crediting indirect work for operational audit stud-ies is by using SIAMs. AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, furnishes details on SIAMs. 3.25.7.3.  Pace Rating. When using work sampling, the consultant compares the observed pace ofthe worker to the normal pace at which the work would be done. This comparison and associatedadjustment of step times is called pace rating and is designed to account for varying experienceand skill levels within the work center. Instructions for pace rating are in AFMAN 38-208, Vol-ume 2. 3.25.7.4.  On-Call Time: 3.25.7.4.1.  On-call time is a period of time an off-duty worker is available at a prearrangedoff-duty location and can be reached by telephone or other means. 3.25.7.4.2.  When authorized work is required and cannot be held over to the next duty day,credit the work center with the productive time expended and the travel time needed to get tothe job site and return to the off-duty location. 3.25.7.4.3.  Examples of on-call time are: a photographer who periodically is needed to takephotos after duty hours; a maintenance journeyman needed infrequently to repair or replace acritical item of equipment; or an information officer who responds to local press inquirieswhen notified. 3.25.7.4.4.  Off-duty time spent waiting for a call is not measured or included in manpowerstandards. 3.25.7.5.  Borrowed Time and Loaned Time. 3.25.7.5.1.  Borrowed time is time provided by personnel authorized and assigned to anotherwork center but used to do productive work within the work center being studied. Include bor-rowed man-hours under the pertinent process or step. 3.25.7.5.2.  Loaned time is time expended by work center personnel to do work which is theresponsibility of another work center. Do not include loaned man-hours in the loaning workcenters’ manpower standard. 3.25.7.6.  Overtime Credit. Uncompensated overtime credit is the productive time spent in excessof regularly scheduled duty hours. This time must be used to do productive work and cannot becaused by nonproductive activities or offset by compensatory time. For civilians, include only thatovertime which is documented according to the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) supplement990-2 and AFI 36-802. For military personnel, document and thoroughly analyze the need forovertime. Ask the supervisor to validate overtime. If overtime is a normal occurrence, visit thework center during overtime periods and observe the work in progress. Identify the backlog driv-ing the overtime work. Include validated overtime as part of the relevant process or step time. 3.25.7.7.  Idle Time. This includes time spent by a worker in an avoidable delay status, doingunnecessary work, or doing work not job related. Measure idle time only during work samplingand never include it in the manpower standard. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002733.25.7.8.  Standby Time. This is time spent in a ready status awaiting work when work is unavail-able (for example, the time a taxi driver waits to be dispatched). Include standby time only whenit is essential to do the mission and when no other work (direct or indirect) can be done. 3.25.7.9.  Nonavailable Time. This is time work center personnel spend participating in activitiesdirected, recognized, or approved by the Air Force which render them unavailable for assignedprimary duties. The major groupings of nonavailable activities are leave, PCS-related, medical,organizational duties, education and training, military equal opportunity, and miscellaneous (seeparagraph 3.22.6.). 3.25.7.9.1.  Measure nonavailable activities only with work sampling. Work sampling mustaccount for all man-hours. Do not include nonavailable time in the allowed man-hours used toconstruct the manpower standard. 3.25.7.9.2.  Nonavailable activities measured Air Force wide are shown in the MAF publishedin AFI 38-201. Do not include these in the POD. 3.25.8.  Workshop Measurement. 3.25.8.1.  General Concepts. Use of a workshop setting provides a valuable tool regardless of thestudy product. A workshop provides a non-threatening environment in which both the M&O teamand the customer can exchange ideas or information. 3.25.8.2.  Workshop Definition. A workshop is defined as a scheduled meeting with a predefinedagenda, with a minimum of one representative from the M&O study team, and one functional rep-resentative. 3.25.8.3.  Workshop Purpose. Use the workshop to define a process or conduct measurement. Inmost cases the workshop attendees are familiar with the processes and can be brought to a consen-sus on the information of interest. If the workshop OA measurement approach is used, be sure theworkshop participants are representative of the locations or units to which the information willapply. The functional OPR makes the final determination on workshop composition but mustassure the project team that proper representation is provided. 3.25.8.3.1.  When the To-Be design for the organization is developed, present it to a group offunctional representatives. This will allow ideas to be discussed by the experts in a non-threat-ening atmosphere. 3.25.8.3.2.  Also use the workshop to present the overall plan of attack to a group of functionalrepresentatives. If there are any potential problems in data collection methods or sources, theycan be identified during the workshop. 3.25.8.4.  Workshop Procedures. 3.25.8.4.1.  Define Purpose of the Workshop. Before you can conduct or even plan a work-shop, you must know the purpose or ultimate goal. Develop the workshop’s objectives; howmany processes need to be measured, do frequencies and benchmark times need to be col-lected, how many work centers are there, and what is the scope of the study. 3.25.8.4.2.  Determine Location of the Workshop. When selecting the workshop location, con-sider cost, availability of facilities, and the project team location. Schedule the workshop at acentralized location to reduce the overall travel costs. Conducting the workshop at the studyteam’s base will also expedite the process. 74AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.25.8.4.3.  Determine Who Should Attend. Considering the purpose of the workshop, youneed to determine who should attend. Considering study scope and contract objectives, decidewho should attend the workshop to include the functional representatives. For example, an AirForce study would need a participant from each MAJCOM who has the authority to speak forthe MAJCOM. Also needed is a base-level expert who has recent hands-on experience in thework center. The senior functional manager should hand-pick the study participants. It isimperative the right people are selected for the success of the workshop. Always ensure com-plete representation while trying to minimize the number of participants. If the purpose is topresent ideas for a reengineering study, and/or to gain MAJCOM support, request a strongcontingent of MAJCOM-level personnel. 3.25.8.4.3.1.  If the purpose is to conduct workshop measurement, request personnel withrecent work center experience. 3.25.8.4.3.2.  If the purpose of the workshop includes developing a standard with wartimeapplication, make sure personnel with a readiness background or personnel who haverecently participated in contingency operations or exercises attend. 3.25.8.4.3.3.  A general rule of thumb is that a good mix of officer, enlisted, and civilianpersonnel is beneficial. Each brings a different set of values to the workshop. Presentingcriteria for attendee selection (to the function, MAJCOM, etc.) may be helpful to reducethe risk of nonqualified participants attending just because they are available. 3.25.8.4.4.  Schedule Workshop. Estimate how much time it will take to meet the objectives.Prepare a plan or schedule of those processes to measure and their order of measurement. Con-sider both the study needs and the needs of the attendees when scheduling the workshop. Ifthere are conflicts with other events (major exercises, inspections, etc.), the attendees may beforced to cancel or send a replacement that does not necessarily meet the needs of the work-shop. 3.25.8.4.5.  Prepare and Distribute Preworkshop Information Package. Send an informationpackage to each attendee. Make the materials as personalized as possible (addressed by nameand possibly with some specific information the attendee requested). Also include in the pack-age base and local area information, a workshop agenda, travel instructions (if appropriate),and any other information that will contribute to the success of the workshop. Identify infor-mation/data the participants will be expected to bring to the workshop, and provide informa-tion that can be read before the event, thus saving workshop time. If possible and appropriate,collect inputs from participants prior to the workshop on information the group will be respon-sible for responding to. 3.25.8.4.6.  Ensure Facilities Are Ready. As part of the workshop planning, make sure that allequipment is available at the workshop location. Give consideration to a room layout thatgives the appearance that all attendees are equal. 3.25.8.4.7.  Conduct the Workshop. There are many different ways to conduct a measurementworkshop, and here are just a few ideas or suggestions: 3.25.8.4.7.1.  Ensure all participants know the purpose of the workshop and what their spe-cific responsibilities entail. Prepare briefings or short lesson plans to teach participants thebasic concepts of the tools and techniques you intend to employ. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002753.25.8.4.7.2.  If the workshop focus is manpower estimates (frequencies, per accomplish-ment times) consider the following issues: 3.25.8.4.7.2.1.  Ensure each participant knows exactly what’s included in each processstep before determining a time for it. Clarify any outstanding issues. Reaffirm to themthat you are soliciting unbiased, data-oriented estimates. 3.25.8.4.7.2.2.  Give each participant a vote or opportunity to give their per accom-plishment times and activity frequencies for a process. To the maximum extent possi-ble, use time estimates and frequencies from validated man-hour and workloadcollection systems. If you’re doing an Air Force-wide study, you might want to haveonly one vote per MAJCOM (with the base representatives within a MAJCOM decid-ing on an average time for the MAJCOM) or each location can give individual timesand frequencies. Decide how to record the data before the workshop. Regardless of themanner selected, you must make sure the times provided are kept confidential until allrepresentatives have given their estimates. This prevents attendees from influencingeach other. This is important because it’s the primary means for you to determine vari-ation from representative to representative. This variation is an indicator of areas forefficiencies, or perhaps, unique needs for variance development. Individual times arethe preferred method if you are going to regress the data and build a statistical man-power standard. MAJCOM average times are preferred if you’re going to build a man-power standard with work unit ratio equations. 3.25.8.4.7.2.3.  Ensure that the workshop participants are giving you average times perprocess step, not the worst case scenario or ideal scenario. Be prepared to calculateweighted step averages and show the workshop participants how to do this. 3.25.8.4.7.2.4.  Ensure the workshop participants prove or validate their step times andfrequencies, if necessary, during the workshop. 3.25.8.4.7.2.5.  Tell the workshop participants how their step times and frequencieswill be used to prepare a manpower standard, and give them an example of what thestandard will look like. 3.25.8.4.7.2.6.  Reconcile the measurement data, if possible during the workshop, withthe senior functional manager. 3.25.8.4.7.2.7.  Attempt to gain consensus and agreement on inputs before the end ofthe workshop. This will increase the chance of buy-in and coordination during laterparts of the project. 3.25.8.4.8.  Follow up on Workshop Results. The personnel who attend a workshop have avested interest in the results. This will be especially true if base-level representatives attend theworkshop. Send each participant a summary of the workshop results. Ask the participants tocritique the workshop. 3.25.8.4.9.  Benefits of Workshop Measurement. The major benefit of using workshop mea-surement is that it reduces the study measurement time. It also eliminates the need for anextensive measurement plan, data adjustments, and data errors since they can be handled dur-ing the workshop. 76AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.25.8.4.9.1.  Workshop attendees can identify and quantify (if wanted) MAJCOM vari-ances. This action delivers a more complete manpower picture. 3.25.8.4.9.2.  Having the functional representatives involved from the start drasticallyreduces the staffing of the study final report. 3.25.8.4.9.3.  By utilizing a workshop environment for measurement with our functionalcustomers, we are attempting to build a team with an improved teamwork attitude andapproach. This should create a synergistic, cooperative environment for the rest of thestudy. 3.25.8.4.10.  Drawbacks of Workshop Measurement. The major drawback is the TDY costsand scheduling difficulties associated with a workshop. This will impact the number of peopleattending a workshop. 3.25.9.  Field Measurement. 3.25.9.1.  General Concepts. While workshop measurement involves bringing together expertsfrom several different sites to do a "centralized" measurement, field measurement is just the oppo-site. The project team writes a measurement plan. This plan incorporates the manpower and per-formance improvement initiatives for measurement. The plan is then sent out to a representativesample of locations to conduct measurements using the prescribed measurement technique(s).Like the workshop measurement, the objective of field measurement is to gather informationabout the work center or function. This information or data is then transferred back to the projectteam for consolidation with the other inputs. The field measurement approach may use a numberof measurement techniques. 3.25.9.2.  Field-Level Input Team Activities. 3.25.9.2.1.  Each input team and the local functional representative should consider the follow-ing before beginning measurement: 3.25.9.2.2.  The input team must become familiar with the work center mission, the POD, themeasurement technique, and any local peculiarities so that they can accurately convey findingsto the study team. 3.25.9.2.3.  The functional representative must ensure the M&O consultant (team) is providedaccess to necessary information and that all pertinent information is included in the measure-ment findings. Also, the local functional representatives are an ideal source for identifyingadditional efficiencies that may impact the existing organization and its processes. 3.25.9.3.  Benefits of Field Measurement. 3.25.9.3.1.  The field teams are able to do follow-on data review once analysis begins. Withthe workshop method, once the participants leave, it may be difficult to get the consensus of allattendees on issues raised during limited test measurement. 3.25.9.3.2.  Scheduling becomes less of an issue, as there is little or no TDY travel involved.This means the functional representatives are still in their work centers and are able to controlits activities while helping provide measurement data. 3.25.9.3.3.  The field-level M&O project team would have access to all levels of the workforce to get a very detailed assessment of the work center’s activities. This is an advantageAFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200277over the workshop method that limits the number of functional personnel attending due tospace and monetary considerations. 3.25.9.4.  Drawbacks of Field Measurement. The major drawback to using field measurement isthe increased study measurement time. Due to the number of personnel involved, the probabilityfor data errors (corrections and adjustments) increases, further slowing the process, and introducesmore variation into the data. When using “same eyes” measurement approach, the cost of perform-ing measurement due to TDY is significantly increased. 3.25.10.  Data Examination. The examination and analysis of input data is an integral part of data col-lection and is done by the input team when they are used. Improper examination results in incorrectdata being used for standards development. AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, shows some procedures foreffective data analysis. Basically, the analyst should: 3.25.10.1.  Compare data with known or expected values. 3.25.10.1.1.  Compare measured and collected data with performance standards, directedrequirements, and benchmark values included in the measurement plan. 3.25.10.1.2.  Compare historical workload volume with workload observed during data collec-tion. 3.25.10.1.3.  Compare historical workload volume with the workload (frequencies) obtainedduring measurement. 3.25.10.1.4.  Compare measured man-hours (on a daily basis) with assigned man-hours. 3.25.10.1.5.  Compare workload factor volumes. Compare workload factors either directly orby a ratio relationship. For example, the ratio of aircrew members to aircraft should be predict-able and relatively stable. 3.25.10.2.  Investigate when comparisons yield unreasonable or illogical results. This investiga-tion may lead to a need for re-measurement. Identify situations which logically support apparentdata inconsistencies. Submit rationale for inconsistencies to the study team. 3.25.11.  Data Transmission. The project team should identify the most cost effective data transmis-sion and require its use. 3.25.12.  Review and Coordination. The M&O function coordinates measurement report findings withthe functional community as specified in the MOA. 3.26.  Data Analysis and Computation.  3.26.1.  General Concepts. This section introduces data analysis and computation into the normal flowof standards development activities. It covers general steps on how to conduct data analysis. AFMAN38-208, Volume 2, covers specific procedures. 3.26.2.  Data Analysis and Computation Instructions. Variations in measurement data from the inputlocations or from a workshop measurement are expected. Conduct a systematic data analysis to sepa-rate valid variations from incorrect measurements and make sure inaccurate man-hours are notincluded in computing the manpower model. 3.26.2.1.  Every analysis technique will not apply in all situations. Evaluate measurement datausing comparative arrays, scattergrams, etc. 78AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.26.2.2.  Do not include or exclude measurement data based on arbitrary statistical limits (e.g.,outside two standard deviations of the mean). Evaluate each suspect data point further before mak-ing a final decision on disposition. There is no valid statistical substitute for logical analysis andexamination of the reasons for data variation. If a data point is excluded or adjusted for modelcomputations, document the reason for the exclusion or adjustment. Furnish specific rationale forwhy the standard should apply to a location excluded from computations. 3.26.2.3.  When SIAMs are used for a function, analyze only direct man-hour data. 3.26.2.4.  Do not make arbitrary adjustments to measured data. The project team must coordinateany adjustment with the input team who, in turn, must coordinate the adjustment with the baseOPR. Coordinate adjustments based on functional policy with the functional OPR. Document alladjustments in the data analysis and computations summary and audit trail (backup file) of thestudy report. Audit trails of all corrections, including computational errors and rounding differ-ences, are kept in the study teams’ backup file but are not documented in the study report. 3.27.  Manpower Standard Variances.  3.27.1.  Manpower standard variances are adjuncts to Air Force or command manpower standards andare identified as either positive or negative; variances adjust requirements by either adding or subtract-ing from core manpower as determined by reason of mission, technical, or environmentally uniquereasons. Variances address work that is not accomplished at all locations where the standard appliesand allow for manpower adjustments. They also address location conditions that are significantly dif-ferent from the conditions that the standard covers. Variances increase or decrease requirements IAWvalidated unique needs of a command or location. Variances should be identified during POD devel-opment, measurement plan development/review, and As-Is workshop validation. Any variance identi-fied after this point runs the risk of not receiving man-hour credit during standards implementation. 3.27.2.  The following are examples of possible location-specific differences from documented stan-dardization: 3.27.2.1.  Mission differences. This variance type adds or subtracts man-hours to a location forrequired work not addressed in the core POD (positive) or required work identified in the corePOD but not performed (negative). 3.27.2.2.  Environmental differences. This variance has a similar effect on work center require-ments as a mission variance. However, it accounts for differences in operating conditions otherthan those used to develop the core standard (e.g., snow removal/deicing of aircraft, effects of salt(near ocean) on corrosion control, effects of geographical separation on travel, etc.). 3.27.2.3.  Technological differences. This variance also affects work center requirements; how-ever, it accounts for differences in operating technology (e.g., automated versus nonautomated,special equipment, etc.). An example of a negative technological variance is documenting theman-hour impact (new equipment saved enough man-hours to subtract one authorization at appli-cable location) resulting from implementation of a Fast Payback Capital Investment Program(FASCAP) project. 3.27.3.  When a variance exists at more than four locations, the manpower standard developmentproject team may use a modular equation to adjust the core standard. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002793.27.4.  When a variance is applicable to more than one MAJCOM, it is considered an inherent part ofthe Air Force standard development process. When a variance is only applicable to one MAJCOM,the MAJCOM has the responsibility to develop it. 3.27.5.  In an Air Force standard development effort, MAJCOMs are first given the opportunity toidentify variances during coordination of the process oriented description, measurement plan reviewor in As-Is validation workshop. When a M&O office identifies a potential variance it completes anAF Form 1068, Work Center Analysis Record and sends it to its MAJCOM for review. If the MAJ-COM supports the variance, it sends the AF Form 1068 to the Air Force functional OPR, who con-firms whether the variance is covered in an Air Force core standard and applicability to anotherMAJCOM. If the variance is only applicable to the requesting MAJCOM, the M&O office commentson its merit and tells the MAJCOM whether or not to proceed with variance development. If applica-ble to more than one MAJCOM, AFMIA develops the variance and sends the results to the Air StaffOPR for approval. Instructions for completing an AF Form 1068 are in Table 3.5. If additional help isrequired, contact your parent MAJCOM. Table 3.5.  How To Prepare AF Form 1068, Work Center Analysis Record.BOX 1 2 3 4 5 6A 6B 6C 6D 6E 6F Enter A Grade, name, organization, and duty phone (include DSN number) of individual performing analysis. Grade, name, organization, and duty phone (include DSN number) of functional OPR contact. The work center title and FAC for the specific work center being addressed. The name of the installation and the command where the comments apply. Only one base is put on each form. If there are command-wide variations, put them on one form and only put the MAJCOM title in this block. The date the form is completed. Consecutive numbers for each variance. Appropriate cross-reference to the process, step, or paragraph in the POD for each variance. Each variance title as a separate entry beginning with the impact of the variance (positive or negative) and its type (i.e., mission, environmental, or technological). Complete supporting explanation for each entry. Include the source (e.g., instruction, policy letter, etc.) that is generating the variance. The estimated monthly man-hour impact associated with each positive variance. This column is left blank when identifying possible negative variances. Specific comments on the disposition of each entry as determined by the MAJCOM, AFMIA, or Study Team. AFMIA or Project team confirms if entry is in the AFMS or has merit. 3.27.5.1.  Variances currently valid with the old standard must also be documented and forwardedwith the Reengineering Final Report for review. Failure to do this could inadvertently result in therescinding of old variances. 3.27.5.2.  Variances are forwarded to MAJCOM for staffing, coordination, and concurrence. If theMAJCOM concurs, development of a variance will coincide with the measurement phase of thecore standard. Some variances may require rework as a result of decisions made by the reengineer-ing team during measurement and computation. 80AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.27.5.3.  During normal reviews of published standards, it is possible things may have changedresulting in a need for an update to the standard. New variances identified during a standardsreview will be documented and forwarded to the applicable OPR, Air Staff, or MAJCOM for dis-position. Each installation MO with their functional OPR will be responsible for coordinating thepotential variance at their base. 3.27.6.  Positive Variance Development. 3.27.6.1.  By definition, processes outlined for positive variances must not be in the core POD.MAJCOM or higher headquarters policy or publication must direct these added activities. 3.27.6.2.  DELETED. 3.27.6.2.1.  DELETED. 3.27.6.2.2.  DELETED. 3.27.6.2.3.  DELETED. 3.27.6.2.4.  DELETED. 3.27.6.2.5.  DELETED. 3.27.6.3.  Man-hour credit can be given for these activities in support of mobility, deployment, orwar plan exercises. 3.27.6.3.1.  Developing mobility and work center tasking plans. 3.27.6.3.2.  Maintaining a day-to-day mobility capability according to the mobility and workcenter tasking plans. Some of these activities include: 3.27.6.3.2.1.  Periodically taking inventory of mobility containers. 3.27.6.3.2.2.  Removing and replacing materials in mobility containers. 3.27.6.3.2.3.  Inspecting mobility equipment containers and equipment for proper identifi-cation and serviceability. 3.27.6.3.2.4.  Maintaining the mobility status of personnel and equipment. 3.27.6.3.3.  Work accomplished during exercises by assigned work center personnel is theresponsibility of the work center but only occurs because an exercise took place. An exampleis the reporting to, and signing in at, the mobility processing line by work center personnel.This may also be work that occurs on a day-to-day basis in the normal work center area, buthas significant frequency increases caused by exercise workload. In this case, define workactivity in sufficient detail to discriminate between normal work center requirements and exer-cise work center requirements. This ensures activity frequencies for the variance are not dupli-cated in the categories of the basic standard. 3.27.6.3.4.  Work done in an exercise by assigned work center personnel that is a responsibil-ity of the function (two-digit functional account code) but not a peacetime responsibility ofany specific work center within the function. An example of this is when a vehicle mainte-nance craftsman within AETC performs aerial port duties in support of a deployment exercise.Make sure this work is not a responsibility of another work center. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002813.27.6.3.5.

Use SIAMs to credit a work center for indirect man-hours associated with a positivevariance. The following instructions allow credit for indirect personnel-generated man-hours for apositive variance: 3.27.6.8.1.  Step 1. Measure the direct man-hours associated with the variance. For example,let's assume the added direct man-hours are 206.47. 3.27.6.8.2.  Step 2. Convert the direct man-hours to manpower. In our example: 206.47/ (151.5 x 1.077) = 1.265 3.27.6.8.3.  Step 3. Decide whether the fractional manpower derived in the previous step is tobe a civilian, officer, or enlisted requirement. 3.27.6.8.4.  Step 4. Use an activity frequency of 1.265 (step 2) to find the number of personnelgenerated (PG) man-hours. Add to the measured direct variance man-hours. 3.27.6.8.5.  Indirect fixed tasks. These will not be credited to variances since, by definition, thefixed man-hours will not change. 3.27.6.9.  DELETED. 82Table 3.7.  DELETED. Table 3.8.  DELETED. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.27.7.  Negative Variance Development. The form a negative variance man-hour equation takesdepends on the nature of the work not being done. 3.27.7.1.  Often, the excluded work is best represented as a percentage of the total man-hours forthe work center. In this case, calculate the percentage of excluded man-hours to total work centermeasured man-hours for each measurement location excluding the work. Then analyze these per-centages using the data examination techniques in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2. Compute the meanpercentage value and use it to build a negative variance man-hour equation in the form of Y = bX,where b equals the percentage value and where X equals the total work center man-hours fromapplying the work center determinant at a base covered by the variance. 3.27.7.2.  Other times, when excluded work does not change as other variables or factors change,display the variance equation as a constant (in terms of man-hours or whole manpower). 3.27.8.  Format Guidance. Format the variance using the AFMIA home page, Air Force ManpowerStandards, Tech Guidance and Forms, Air Force Manpower Standards Publishing Guide. 3.28.  Future Manpower Requirements Determination.  3.28.1.  The manpower standard development process identifies a work center’s man-hour to work-load relationship and quantifies manpower requirements for Air Force functional activities. Use theresulting standard as a tool for the accurate distribution and use of Air Force manpower resources. Thefunctional area manager at either Air Force or MAJCOM level can initiate a manpower standarddevelopment study. Some reasons for a study include: 3.28.1.1.  Major changes in policy, mission, equipment, technology, organization, or work envi-ronment invalidates the existing standard. 3.28.1.2.  Performance measures system feedback data shows the standard is no longer valid. 3.28.1.3.  Changes in workload volume may show the standard no longer accurately predicts man-power requirements. 3.28.2.  Manpower Standard. 3.28.2.1.  Manpower standards may be applicable to peacetime, contingency operations, or both.Standards development varies from study to study. All functions or work centers do not lendthemselves to the same method of determining requirements, meaning all standards are not devel-oped using the same tool(s) and technique(s). 3.28.2.2.  Manpower standard variances address work that is not included in the core manpowerstandard. These differences may result in increases or decreases to core manpower requirements(see paragraph 3.27.) 3.28.3.  Manpower Standard Development Concepts. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002833.28.3.1.  Manpower standards are based on the concept that like work center operations are effi-cient and standardized throughout the Air Force or MAJCOM. 3.28.3.2.  A single location measurement can be considered for application or adoption at all likelocations, however it is not the preferred method. 3.28.3.3.  Base measurement and computation procedures on average monthly man-hour andworkload requirements. 3.28.3.4.  The Air Force develops manpower standards that apply primarily to peacetime environ-ments. However, because of the uncertainty involved with addressing a war time scenario, refer tothe applicable functional manager for guidance. 3.28.3.5.  Commercial activities present special opportunities to develop and maintain manpowerstandards. Changes to manpower occur when an activity remains in-house after a cost study.These activities do not remain static simply because a cost study has been conducted. Developmanpower and workload relationships to allow for and to document these changes as follows: 3.28.3.5.1.  Use direct labor projected in the in-house cost estimate and the workload specifiedin the performance work statement (PWS) to develop these relationships in the form of a man-power equation. The equation may be applicable to multiple locations having the same perfor-mance requirements or may be developed for a single location. 3.28.3.5.2.  Use the PWS as the basis for a POD to reflect the process steps involved and thelevel of performance expected. 3.28.3.5.3.  Once an equation is developed, changes in manpower requirements should resultonly from changes in workload, procedures, responsibilities, quality required, etc., thatdirectly affect the PWS. For example, the manpower community uses the same test to reviewincreases as the contracting officer uses if the activity goes contract and the contractorattempts to increase prices. 3.28.3.6.  Simulation Data Requirements. 3.28.3.6.1.  Types Of Studies. Using simulation is a viable option when determining require-ments. There are three distinct methods currently verifiable that can be used. 3.28.3.6.2.  Single Point Application. The simulation is built and run for a single location. 3.28.3.6.3.  Input Points To An Equation. The sample location’s inputs are used to drive indi-vidual simulation runs and the output is plotted for total man-hours. 3.28.3.6.4.  Programmable Model. The equation is developed using traditional techniques. Aratio equation or correlation and regression is used to determine an appropriate arrival stream.The output of the simulation run is used to determine the direct man-hours applicable to thefunction. Appropriate SIAM and other man-hours are then accumulated to determine therequirement. 3.28.3.6.5.  Data Reporting Requirements. 841. 2. 3 4 5 6 7 8 AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Resource Rules Process Cycle time Interarrival time Run Length and Replications Warm-up Period Residuals Acceptable Levels of Resource Utilization Assumption List What resources (manpower) perform what processes/tasks within the model by skill level or other approved qualifications Method used to determine one cycle of each process and any variation introduced (identifying methodology and rational) Identify method used to determine frequency of occurrences and any variation introduced (Identifying methodology and rational) Identify the run length of the model and conversion methodology to a monthly timeframe.

The information in the following paragraphs represents the min-imum essential formatting requirements. Any other information deemed "value added" may beincluded. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002873.29.4.1.  Heading. The FAC is preceded by "AFMS" for Air Force manpower standards. 3.29.4.1.1.  When two manpower standards exist for the same work center under two differentorganizational structures, add an alphabetical prefix to the number. 3.29.4.1.2.  To identify a standard that applies to wartime only, add the prefix "W" to the num-ber. 3.29.4.2.  Title. For the title use the appropriate designation (flight, section, or element) to identifythe standard MAJCOM or base unique manpower standards, add the appropriate MAJCOM desig-nation or base name after the title. For example, "Security Operations Flight, Ramstein." 3.29.4.3.  Mission Statement, Responsibility Statement, Authority, and Applicability. Combinethese elements to form the purpose paragraph, which is the first paragraph of the manuscript: 3.29.4.3.1.  Mission Statement. Prepare a brief, concise statement of the mission objectives forthe function under study. Try to limit this statement to five typed lines. 3.29.4.3.2.  Responsibility Statement. This is a series of broad statements that define the mis-sion support capabilities of each subordinate element. These statements should encompass themajor processes or work activities performed in support of the flight. If a flight has no subor-dinate elements, the responsibility statement is not required. 3.29.4.3.3.  Authority. Cite appropriate functional and management engineering sources thatsupport the manpower standard and its development. 3.29.4.3.4.  Applicability. Include a statement that identifies the environment in which thefunction operates (peacetime/wartime). Additionally, specifically address the following: 3.29.4.3.4.1.  Furnish an applicability statement by MAJCOM, organizational elements,weapon system, etc., as pertinent. Specify the locations where the standard applies or doesnot apply, whichever is less. Also identify any limitations that restrict when and how themanpower standard can be used. 3.29.4.3.4.2.  Identify specific applicability to the Air National Guard and Air ForceReserve units programmed to be gained by active force MAJCOMs and FOAs. 3.29.4.3.4.3.  State that bases undergoing AFI 38-203 cost comparison studies will beexempt from standard application. Also state that standards do not apply to locations thathave completed cost comparisons. For objective flight standards, the above statements areonly applicable if the entire flight is undergoing or has undergone an AFI 38-203 cost com-parison study. If an element within a flight is undergoing or has undergone an AFI 38-203cost comparison study, a mission variance must be developed to account for theseman-hours. See Figure 3.17. for an example of application instructions for a cost compar-ison mission variance. 88AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Figure 3.17.  Example Application Instructions for a Cost Comparison Mission Variance.APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR A-76 COST COMPARISON POSITIONS 1. NEGATIVE MISSION VARIANCE. Develop a negative mission variance to reduce the core process man-hours for those processes that have undergone an A-76 Cost Comparison and have been contracted-out or remained in-house. 1.1. STEP 1. Determine the core process man-hours that were cost compared by identifying the cost compared processes listed in the Process Analysis Summary. For example, assume that BITC was cost compared in the IM Flight. The process "Manage Official Mail" is the only process performed by BITC. This process equates to 386.00 core man-hours (2.40 fractional manpower). 1.2. STEP 2. Determine total flight core process man-hours. In the IM Flight, the total flight core man-hours equate to 2978.50. 1.3. STEP 3. Determine the percentage of the cost compared process to the total flight core process man-hours. In this example, it equates to 12.95%  (386.00/2978.50). This step is necessary because the cost compared process man-hours are imbedded in the core +/- manpower equation (Y = 18.54  + (population supported - 3,000) * 0.003056). 1.4. STEP 4. Apply the core +/- manpower equation (Y = 18.54  +  (population supported - 3,000) * 0.003056). For example, assume that the population at your location is 5,000. This equates to 24.65 fractional manpower requirements. 1.5. STEP 5. Determine the negative variance manpower (man-hours) by multiplying the fractional manpower result in Step 4, by the cost compared process percentage in step 3. For example, 24.65 * 12.95% = 3.19. 2. POSITIVE MISSION VARIANCE. Develop a positive mission variance to account for the inclusion of the in-house or contracted-out manpower required to perform the processes IAW the A-76 Cost Comparison Performance Work Statement (PWS) and the Most Efficient Organization (MEO). 2.1. REMAINED IN-HOUSE. If the processes underwent competitive sourcing (an A-76 cost comparison or a direct conversion), and remained in-house, update the UMD to reflect the manpower earned in the MEO and code these civilian authorizations with an MES code of “S” and the appropriate reason code (RSC).  Develop a positive variance, which contains an equation that is responsive to future PWS changes in workload, procedures, responsibilities, and quality required, etc.  Note:  With a direct conversion, the MEO is the “as is operation” which may also change based on future PWS changes in workload, procedures, responsibilities, and quality required, etc.  AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002892.2. CONTRACTED-OUT. If the processes underwent competitive sourcing (an A-76 cost comparison or a direct conversion) and is contracted-out, update the UMD manpower requirement to reflect the contract manpower equivalents (CMEs) earned in the MEO.  Enter a manpower type attribute of “CME” category attribute of “CIV” and civilian employment category of “CEC 80” on UMD.  Develop a positive variance, which contains an equation that is responsive to future PWS changes in workload, procedures, responsibilities, and quality required, etc.  Note:  With a direct conversion, the MEO is the “as is operation” which may also change based on future PWS workload changes, procedures, responsibilities, and quality required, etc. NOTE:  When applicable, the variance should also address the number of civilian Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAEs) that were earned as result of contracting out the processes.  Although all QAEs shall be addressed in the variance, only whole manpower can be added to the core standard.  Partial QAEs (.5) or their associated man-hours cannot be added to the application results. 3.29.4.4.  Standard Data. 3.29.4.4.1.  Approval Date. This will remain blank in the study report. 3.29.4.4.2.  Man-hour Data Source. Enter workshop measurement, work sampling, operationalaudit technique, or other development method. Identify relevant policy or publications forstandards developed without work measurement. For a standard developed by the functionalmodel method, include the statement "Historical Documents - Functional Model." 3.29.4.4.3.  Man-hour Equation. State the equation in terms of man-hours unless it representsconstant manpower. If it represents constant manpower, state the equation in terms of wholemanpower requirements and identify the requirements as a manpower value. For example, Y =1 (Constant Manpower). If there is more than one equation, include a subparagraph for each.If no equation exists, so state, and document the method for determining manpower require-ments (e.g., "See manpower matrix"). 3.29.4.4.4.  Workload Factor (WLF). 3.29.4.4.4.1.  Title. Enter the complete WLF title. If there is more than one WLF, includea subparagraph for each title and state applicability (for example, peacetime, wartime, orspecific applicability when modular equations are used). For overhead work centers usingsubordinate work center requirements as the WLF, use the title: Required Man-hours inSubordinate Work Centers after Application of the Basic Standard. 3.29.4.4.4.2.  Definition. Use enough detail to ensure complete understanding of the WLF.If there is more than one WLF, include a subparagraph for each definition. For overheadwork centers that use "man-hours in subordinate work centers" as the WLF, use the WLFdefinition, "The total number of required man-hours in (identify the subordinate work cen-ters) as a result of standard application." When the data being collected is classified, addthese statements after the WLF definition: "This data, when collected, is classified. Markand safeguard according to AFI 31-401." 3.29.4.4.4.3.  Source. Identify the exact source including RCS number, section, line num-ber, or column for each workload factor. If there is more than one WLF, include a subpara-graph for each source. If needed, place instructions in this paragraph on how to count the90AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002WLF volume before using it in the standard man-hour equation. For overhead work cen-ters that use man-hours in subordinate work centers as the WLF, use this source: "Standardapplication results for the work centers listed in the definition." If any of these do not havea manpower standard, add the sentence: "For (list those work centers that do not have man-power standards), use the authorizations shown in the unit manpower document (UMD) asthe required manpower." Convert these authorizations (do not use fractional manpowerranges) to man-hours by multiplying by the proper MAF. 3.29.4.4.5.  Points of Contact. Enter the office symbol of the manpower and functional repre-sentatives. 3.29.4.5.  Application Instructions. 3.29.4.5.1.  Give general and specific standard application instructions, computations, use ofextrapolation limits, aggregation, and use of fractional manpower. 3.29.4.5.2.  Include any special instructions on how to use WLF data in the man-hour equation(if appropriate). 3.29.4.5.3.  Describe the steps to determine any core plus/minus, or variance man-hours (man-power) if appropriate. 3.29.4.5.4.  Include, if relevant, instructions for substituting grades, AFSCs, and civilianauthorizations; the treatment of contractual workload; and any pertinent aircrew position iden-tifiers. 3.29.4.5.5.  For a manpower standard based on prior application of standards in subordinatework centers, give instructions including the specific standards and sequence of application. 3.29.4.5.6.  Develop a clear, concise statement in the application instructions specifying anyother work centers whose fractional requirement can be aggregated with this work centers’fractional requirement before rounding to whole requirements. For example, the statementshould read: "Fractional manpower requirements resulting from the application of this stan-dard will be aggregated with the fractional requirements for FACs XXXX, XXXX, etc. Aggre-gation will be done according to procedures in AFI 38-201." 3.29.4.6.  Statement of Conditions (SOC). The purpose of the SOC is to document general condi-tions in the work center which impact manpower requirements. It describes those significant initi-atives incorporated into the standard. Use the SOC in the measurement plan and comments fromthe measurement reports to build the SOC for the standard. Provide a general accounting of thebaseline operating environment conditions under which the work centers’ manpower was com-puted. 3.29.4.7.  Functional Description or Process Oriented Description. Include as an attachment to themanuscript, a copy of the process or work-activity for each work center covered by the standard.Make sure the POD complies with instructions in paragraph 3.22. of this volume. For standardsdeveloped by directed requirement, staffing pattern, position manning, or functional model, adetailed POD may be replaced by a functional description. 3.29.4.8.  Standard Manpower Table. 3.29.4.8.1.  Include as an attachment to the manuscript an AF Form 1113, Standard Man-power Table, or manpower matrix for each flight or work center. It should encompass theAFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 200291whole manpower required (by AFSC and grade) for all possible combinations within theapplicability range (e.g., core plus or minus and all variances not specifying a fixed require-ment). Develop skills and grades for each manpower increment between the extrapolation lim-its on the manpower table. Complete the manpower table according to instructions in Table3.9. Use as many pages as necessary to display the standard’s manpower extrapolation range.If a manpower matrix is used instead of the AF Form 1113, ensure that the same data isreported. Contact AFMIA for approval of all comparable forms and manpower matrices priorto finalizing the AFMS. 3.29.4.8.2.  When a colonel requirement or position is identified, the project team verifiesOPR justification by complying with procedures outlined in AFI 38-201. 3.29.4.8.3.  Show rated specialty requirements only if the processes described in the POD areclearly associated with the skills described in AFI 36-2105 for the rated specialty. 3.29.4.8.4.  Use instructions in AFMAN 38-208, Volume 2, to identify AFSC, skill level, andgrade requirements for standards. 3.29.4.8.5.  The manpower table or matrix always shows military specialties and skill levels.Military grades are shown when a military and civilian mix exists. An exception is allowed tothis rule if the work center is an all-civilian work center with a military manager. Use theabbreviation CIV under the grade column only when the work center is all civilians. The civil-ian personnel classification office identifies the suitable civilian grades. 3.29.4.9.  Variances. Include as an attachment to the manuscript a copy of all approved variances.Complete the following for each variance: 3.29.4.9.1.  Variance Title. Provide a short title for each variance. Precede the title with theapplication (positive or negative) and the appropriate variance category (mission, environmen-tal, or technological). For example, "Positive Mission Variance for Contract Quality Assur-ance Evaluation." 3.29.4.9.2.  Applicability. Provide a detailed applicability statement (e.g., unique to a specificlocation, command, etc.). 3.29.4.9.3.  Impact. Provide the man-hour (followed by the fractional manpower in parenthe-ses) impact associated with the variance. Also include a breakout of the impact to the levelprovided in the definition (e.g., down to step level). If the variance is negative, make sure theimpact is shown as a negative value. Include any workload data collection (title, definition,and source of count) and specific application instructions, when appropriate. 92AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Table 3.9.

The valid man-hour data range for this Standard. Boundaries are the lower and upper man-hour extrapolation values. For a standard that yields a constant manpower requirement, enter the words, "Constant Manpower." When a parabola or ratio equation form is used for the standard, specify the upper limit for the workload. Do this by putting the message "(Upper Workload Value = XXX)" under the man-hour range. When the standard contains more than one equation enter See paragraph 5 "Application Instructions" in this block. Enter the man-hour data and upper workload, if applicable, in paragraph 5 of the AFMS cover page. All Air Force Specialty (AFS) titles required in the work center at any requirement level within the applicability range. Use the titles in AFMANs 36-2105 and 36-2108 to identify both military and civilian requirements. Titles must also reflect any prefix or suffix shown in the AFSC column. List officers first, then airmen. Group titles by career area/career progression group, and within career specialty list in order of descending AFSC. Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) that corresponds to the specialty title. List both title and AFSC in descending order of AFSC within career area. When the primary function of the work center is not administration, list administration specialties after all others. For a military requirement, the grade associated with the specified AFSC based on the policy of two grades per skill level for enlisted requirements. For example: A 7-level will be either a TSgt on MSgt. If any of the manpower requirements are military, treat all requirements as military. When all requirements are civilian, enter "CIV" next to the corresponding AFSC. MAJCOM can replace "CIV" with the appropriate civilian grades in the manpower title. Prior to exercising this option, review AFI 38-201 for policy guidance. Within AFSC, list grades in descending order. Show all grades below SRA as A1C, and show both 1st and 2d lieutenants as LT. Use standard data codes, for example, CMS instead of CMSGT. Appropriate distribution of whole manpower requirements by AFSC and grade for each level of requirements within the range bounded by the lower and upper extrapolation limits. To insure that all levels of manpower are covered on the manpower table, consider all of the MAFs that apply, then: (1) The smallest number of people shown on the table is the number required for the largest applicable MAF at the lower extrapolation limit. (2) The largest number of people shown on the table is the number required for the smallest applicable MAF at the upper extrapolation limit. The total requirement for AFSCs and grades in the column. The first and last total will reflect the manpower associated with the extrapolation range. 3.29.4.10.  Process Analysis Summary. Include, as attachment 4 to the cover page, a process anal-ysis summary. List each process (using the POD process number) by priority, from highest to low-est (highest being listed first). Include the process time (in man-hours and minutes), the projectedworkload volume (for standards with fixed core manpower), and the resulting fractional man-power (for standards with fixed core manpower). AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002933.29.4.11.

Trial Impact Application.  3.30.1.  General Concepts. Once a manpower standard or variance has been developed, the next stepis to apply the standard. This accomplishes two objectives. It validates that the standard or variancecaptures all mission-essential workload and predicts what the manpower impact could be if the stan-dard is approved for implementation. Application results are used to brief senior staff and are filed forhistorical purposes. The process consists of three basic steps: workload factor collection and valida-tion; manpower standard trial application; and documenting what the predicted manpower impactwould be if the standard is implemented. 3.30.2.  Workload Values for Peacetime Application of Standards. Collect the workload factors iden-tified in the manpower standard or variance. The baseline quarter for a trial impact application is thefourth quarter of the fiscal year in which implementation is scheduled. Since the trial impact applica-tion only addresses one fiscal quarter, make sure the workload levels represent the average monthlylevel of work present in the quarter. Look at historical monthly data to set up existing workload char-acteristics (for example, relatively stable levels or increasing and decreasing trends). Assure the his-torical workload counts are verified. To analyze this historical data: 3.30.2.1.  Get at least one full cycle of WLF data. 3.30.2.1.1.  For WLFs that have been routinely reported in the past and have not had a defini-tion change, get two to three years of historical data (based on availability). The more dataused in the analysis, the more confidence the average WLF value inspires. 3.30.2.1.2.  Less than a full cycle of data may be all that is available. If so, use caution in mak-ing assumptions about the relevance of averages or trends based on this limited data. 3.30.2.2.  Construct a control chart for each WLF. Plot each month of data and use the mean of alldata points as the centerline. The upper and lower control limits equal two standard deviations ofthis mean. 3.30.2.3.  Study the control charts. This activity requires the use of common sense, logic, andresearch abilities. 3.30.2.3.1.  First, look at the control chart to pinpoint possible outlying months of data. To findthe reasons for these workload levels, research past records and discuss this data with the func-tional OPR. 3.30.2.3.1.1.  If these months are not representative of the work center and the craftsmanunderstands the reasons why they are different (for example, incorrect reporting), excludethem and reconstruct the control chart. 3.30.2.3.1.2.  If the values for these months are in error and a corrected value can be accu-rately documented and supported, adjust the values for these months and reconstruct thecontrol chart. 3.30.2.3.1.3.  If no explanations can be found for the outlying months, assume the data cor-rect. 3.30.2.3.2.  If research shows that an extraordinary situation existed that caused most of thehistorical data for a work center to be nonrepresentative, then adjust reported workload data tomore accurately show the workload levels. After this has been done, give a full explanation ofthe situation and how adjusted workload values were computed. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002973.30.2.4.  Make conclusions about the WLF data. The craftsman looks at the control chart to seehow the points are distributed about the mean after validating the data. 3.30.2.4.1.  If points are evenly distributed about the mean, this shows relative workload sta-bility. When logic supports this conclusion, use the mean as the workload value. 3.30.2.4.2.  If the points show a steadily increasing or decreasing trend, this may show aslowly evolving change in work center workload. 3.30.2.4.2.1.  If thorough research can show that this trend will continue at the same rate,get the workload value by averaging only the last three months of data. 3.30.2.4.2.2.  If the trend appears to have leveled off for the last three months at a higher orlower level, use that level as the workload value. 3.30.2.5.  Document results of the historical workload analysis. Each base included in the trialimpact application will document its data as directed by the study team. 3.30.3.  Work Center Manpower Requirements. 3.30.3.1.  Once workload values are collected and verified for the baseline fiscal quarter, use thisworkload in the standard man-hour equation to find work center manpower requirements. 3.30.3.2.  As part of the work center trial application, include the military and civilian mix. Usemilitary essentiality as the prime consideration for setting up this mix. AFI 38-204 states the basicpolicy for identifying when manpower must be military and when it can be civilian. Since theresults of the trial impact application show the unconstrained manpower requirements of a workcenter, do not consider current funding ceilings when determining this mix. If application of themilitary essentiality criteria would dictate a change in this ratio, there is no need to keep an exist-ing ratio between military and civilian manpower. However, if the trial impact application is beingdone by the study team, use existing ratios or HQ USAF guidance as a guide for estimating howincreases or decreases in work center manpower requirements impact the military and civilianmix. 3.30.3.3.  Some work centers may have part of their workload done by contract personnel. Makean adjustment for the contracted work since standard application results in manpower require-ments for in-house personnel. Make this adjustment by subtracting a contract manpower equiva-lent value from the standard application man-hours. See Figure 3.17. 3.30.3.3.1.  Contract manpower equivalents are the number of equivalent man-hours requiredif the contracted workload was done in-house. 3.30.3.3.2.  Get contract manpower equivalent man-hours by multiplying the contract man-power equivalents shown in the UMD by the pertinent normal workweek civilian MAF. 3.30.4.  Work Center Impact. Ensure the trial impact application includes all bases where the standardapplies. 3.30.5.  Documenting the Impact Application. The project team files trial application data compiledfor each base as backup data. The project team assembles the documentation from the trial impactapplication into sections, one for each standard applied. Within each section, there are two parts: thetrial impact application summaries and the explanation of changes. 98AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.30.5.1.  Trial Impact Application Summary. The trial impact application summary for an AirForce standard consists of a summary for the overall Air Force and a summary for each MAJ-COM. For Air Force standards and variances, MAJCOMs furnish AFMIA the trial impact sum-mary for each of their bases. MAJCOMs include: 3.30.5.1.1.  Total authorizations for peacetime studies. Use the manpower data system, Cur-rent Requirement Authorization Table (less individual mobilization augmentation authoriza-tions). To obtain total authorizations for wartime studies, use the manpower data system,Current Requirement Authorization Table and the Current Requirement Guard and ReserveTable. 3.30.5.1.2.  Workload counts used to price out the basic standard and a list of approved vari-ances used to compute total man-hours. 3.30.5.2.  Explanation of Changes. This is a narrative description of the overall impact the stan-dard has on the work center. Comment on each of these. 3.30.5.2.1.  What caused the overall increases or decreases in manpower requirement totals:increased workload, new work, decreased workload, productivity improvements, or policychanges? 3.30.5.2.2.  What does the standard buy in terms of additional capability for the Air Force andwhat would be the result if the standard were not implemented. For example, if a new standardin function XXXX is not funded, it may prevent the function from being able to meet wartimerequirements for critical skills and force the continued use of nonappropriated fund civilians inthe work center. 3.30.6.  Staffing for Approval. Once all trial applications are assembled, then an overall effect ofimplementing the standard can be presented to the applicable MAJCOM and Air Staff offices. Theresult will be either approval or disapproval for the actual implementation and application of the stan-dard or variance. Section 3G—Coordination And Approval--Phase 6 3.31.  General Concepts. A vital link to any improvement process is coordination. Any improvementaction(s) could possibly impact another functional area or areas. Although the action may improve yourprocess, it could be detrimental to someone else’s process, i.e., degrading someone’s wartime capability. 3.31.1.  Coordination Objectives. Three objectives must be met during this phase: (1) Articulate whatmust be done to effectively staff and coordinate change proposals up to and through the Air ForceCorporate Structure to obtain senior Air Force leadership approval. (2) Categorize and define changesof new process designs, goals, and objectives to achieve envisioned end-state. (3) Show clear linkageto Air Force core competencies and demonstrate operationalized quality. 3.31.2.  Project Partner Draft/Revise Strategic Plan. 3.31.2.1.  Goals and objectives necessary to bring about the envisioned state must be developedand completed. 3.31.2.2.  Objectives should be measurable and have timelines for translation into action plans. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002993.31.2.3.  Goals and objectives must clearly communicate to leadership, stakeholders, and projectpartners what has to take place in order to bring about the change to the envisioned state. 3.31.3.  Staff Results. 3.31.3.1.  Start at the earliest stages of reengineering. 3.31.3.2.  The Communication Plan developed in Phase 1 and updated throughout each subse-quent phase should provide the material necessary to assemble the briefings. 3.31.3.3.  Continue to reinforce what has previously been staffed—demonstrate progress andresolve to achieve end state. 3.31.3.4.  Involve all stakeholders which gives the advantage of knowing their positions/ideas andnurturing buy-in. This should also include other functions affected by changes made in the processmethods, e.g., AF/SC for communication changes, AF/LE for equipment or transportation, AF/DPfor personnel or training, etc. 3.31.4.  Refine Options. 3.31.4.1.  Changes recommended/directed at each level of briefing must be incorporated, if appro-priate. 3.31.4.2.  A thorough After Action Review should be completed after briefing each echelon ofcommand and appropriate revisions made prior to proceeding to the next level. 3.31.5.  Refine Resource Management Requirements. Based on analysis data compiled throughoutprevious phases, all resource management data should be refined to reflect the most accurate informa-tion. 3.31.6.  Present Options to MAJCOMs. The Business Case Analysis, along with the results of optionsanalysis and recommendations made at previous briefings, should be presented to senior MAJCOMleadership for their concurrence or approval if it is a MAJCOM study. 3.31.7.  Present Option(s)/Recommendations(s) to Corporate Air Force Leaders. Staff results of previ-ous briefings through the chain of command and with other Air Force functionals, if necessary, andobtain approval from the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS). 3.31.8.  Communicate Decision to Stakeholders: 3.31.8.1.  Once approval has been obtained from the corporate leadership of the Air Force, thedecision should be transmitted to all concerned members. 3.31.8.2.  Use all available communication means. 3.31.8.3.  The Air Force Public Affairs department can be a helpful partner and provide assistancein the dissemination of the information. 3.31.9.  All functional managers will seek corporate structure review and approval for required fund-ing levels upon completion of the Seven-Phase Approach review of their processes. Per the AnnualPlanning and Programming Guidance, Air Staff functional managers, in partnership with AFMIA orapplicable MAJCOM/XPM (for MAJCOM studies), will brief AFCS on the results of their efforts.The following paragraphs state the purpose and make-up of the AFSC. Figure 3.21. depicts the orga-nizational structure of the AFCS. 100AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.32.  The Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS). This portion addresses the details to provide anin-depth understanding of the key players, organization, relationships, and processes of the AFCS. Figure 3.21.  The Air Force Corporate Structure. 3.32.1.  Panels. The five Mission and nine Mission Support Panels (see Figure 3.20.) are the AirForce centers of expertise for their areas, and they are the first level of corporate deliberation in theAFCS. The primary purpose of the Panels is to support the resource allocation program. The Panelsserve as the initial point of entry for issues from the Program Element Monitor, Integrated ProcessTeams (IPTs), MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs which require corporate review. The applicable panelwill normally be the initial entry into the AFCS for MAJCOM-unique requirements/reengineeredstudies. 3.32.2.  The Air Force Group (AFG). The AFG provides senior-level resolution of resource allocationand other issues prior to Air Force Board (AFB) review and is normally the level Air Force manpowerstudy results will enter the AFCS process. The AFG develops the overall integrated Air Force pro-gram for submission to the AFB. The AFG reviews issues submitted by the Program Objective Mem-AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002101orandum Panels and IPT and forwards significant issues to the AFB. The AFG is the first level of thecorporate structure that integrates Air Force mission areas into a balanced Air Force program. TheAFG Chair presents the integrated program to the AFB for refinement. The HQ USAF/XPP Deputychairs the AFG. AFG membership includes Colonel/civilian equivalent membership from the samefunctional areas as the AFB. Figure 3.22. depicts the members of the AFG.

The AFG is the entry point to bring proposals and issues into the AFCS for review. Tocome to the AFG, either a Panel Chair or AFG member must normally sponsor an issue. Againthis is the level most Air Force studies will enter the Corporate Process. 3.32.2.2.  The AFG oversees all programming activities enroute to the AFB. It receives informa-tion briefings needed to analyze programs and develop alternatives and forwards significant andcritical issues for AFB/AFC review and deliberation. The AFG provides Panels and IPTs withfeedback and guidance on their activities. The AFG meets at the discretion of the AFG Chair forthe following purposes: 3.32.2.2.1.  Review program options for compliance with Air Force guidance. 3.32.2.2.2.  Validate cost. 3.32.2.2.3.  Schedule and completeness of program options. 3.32.2.2.4.  Develop new options as needed. 3.32.2.2.5.  Entertain new initiatives to meet core competencies or requirements. 3.32.2.2.6.  Receive briefings as necessary to make informed decisions on Air Force programs. 3.32.3.  The AFB. The AFB provides flag-level (2-star and civilian equivalent) review of resourceallocation and other issues. The AFB reviews issues submitted by the AFG. The AFB directs the focusof the AFG in resolving issues and refines AFG-developed integrated programs for submission to theAFC. Topics brought before the AFB should be limited to important matters requiring corporate con-sideration and resolution. The AFB is chaired by HQ USAF/XPP except for purposes of budget for-mulation and execution. Figure 3.23. depicts the AFB members. Figure 3.23.  The Air Force Board.

The AFC provides DCS and Assistant Secretariat level andselected Directorate level cross-functional review of resource allocation and other issues. The AFCreviews and evaluates programs and issues, guides corporate processes, coordinates functional inter-ests, and tasks the other members of the AFCS. It is the final AFCS body and makes recommendationsto the CSAF and SECDEF. The AFC chair is the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff (AF/CV). Figure 3.24.depicts the two-digit members of the AFC.

The IPTs comprise the multifunctional working-levelinfrastructure and information network that supports both the AFCS as well as the functional staff.IPTs bring together functional expertise into a cross-functional team as the single point of contact fora specific program, process, or issue that requires corporate review. IPTs develop and recommendoptions for a designated program, process, or issue based on corporate guidance. IPTs apply func-tional expertise to corporate problems, maintain a knowledge base of the issues, and advise functionalchain issues/resolution options as they develop. The ultimate goals of IPTs in the AFCS are toimprove communication across the staff, develop a “single face” or POC for our customers, and insti-tutionalize a corporate approach to decision making throughout the Air Force. Section 3H—Implementation—Phase 7 3.33.  General Concepts. How does one implement a new process or processes? There is no text bookanswer. Several things impact implementation, including money. Does the new process require newequipment (which spawns new training)? If new equipment is involved, it will have to be budgeted for.Implementing the new process will take time. This phase is the longest of the seven to complete. All theaffected players, i.e., employees, customers, and stakeholders, must go through the initial growing painsof adjusting to the new process. The following are steps towards implementation: 3.33.1.  Implementation Objectives. 3.33.1.1.  Functional is postured to implement change. 3.33.1.2.  Functional recognizes importance of continuous communication on implementation. 3.33.1.3.  Functional has effective performance measures in place. 3.33.1.4.  Develop manpower determinant for new processes. 3.33.2.  Posture Project team to Implement. AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20021033.33.2.1.  This activity will require the consultation team to provide advice, fine tune processesand costs, and recommend sources to address implementation issues. 3.33.2.2.  Actions may vary from coordination to personnel actions, facilities, training, timelines,reorganization actions, budget, technological integration, future processes, resources, etc. 3.33.3.  Extend or Revise Communication Plan. 3.33.3.1.  Helps satisfy people’s need to understand what expectations are. 3.33.3.2.  Feedback helps prevent bottlenecks. 3.33.3.3.  Communicates changes for contingencies. 3.33.4.  Institutionalize Performance Measures. 3.33.4.1.  Product or service oriented/customer focused. 3.33.4.2.  Standards and stretch goals established. 3.33.4.3.  Reporting and feedback mechanisms in place. 3.33.5.  Finalize/Update Manpower Standard(s)/Variance(s). 3.33.5.1.  Process oriented. 3.33.5.2.  Rooted in mission essential task lists. 3.33.5.3.  Programmable workload factor? 3.33.6.  Share Results/Benchmarks. Provide project results throughout the Air Force and the lessonslearned database (best practices database). 3.33.7.  Be Prepared for Counter-implementation Tactics. 3.33.7.1.  Passive resistance (verbal agreement but with no action) 3.33.7.2.  Diverting promised resources away from the project. 3.33.7.3.  Cooperating, but with the wrong information. 3.33.7.4.  Exaggerating minor technical issues. 3.33.7.5.  Not showing up for meetings. 3.33.7.6.  Spreading rumors. 3.34.  Plan to Implement.  After going through the time-consuming process of improving your func-tion’s activities, you would expect the function to run smoother, demand fewer resources, and allow youto provide world-class service to your customers. After all you did go out to the “Best in Class” organiza-tions in government and the private sector and model the way their processes were designed. So, shouldnot your function be world-class? Maybe not! 3.34.1.  Even though you have followed all of the steps of the Seven-Phase Approach and you havereally improved your processes, there may be a problem achieving savings or gaining the efficienciesyou were expecting. 3.34.2.  One of the biggest reasons why some process improvement projects do not achieve the levelof success the organization expects deals with the issue of organization culture. You can have the104AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002most efficient process in the world, on paper or in a model, and still not have a “world-class” opera-tion. We must remember that people have to execute the plans, perform the activities, and provide theinterface to the customer. If you have left out of the improvement process a plan on how to change thebehavior of the human resource, your project will not succeed. 3.34.3.  Culture change does not come only as a result of a change in the system. It comes as a resultof consistent (incremental) change in the way a person feels about that system. Human beings mustsee that there is less pain and more pleasure (benefit) associated with the changing with than notchanging. 3.34.4.  When an organization is planning a change of any kind that will affect the day-to-day activi-ties of people, the relationship between pain (emotional cost) and pleasure (benefit to the individual)in a person’s mind must be considered. Human beings are stimulated (or held back) based on theirassociation of personal benefit or personal cost to a change in their environment. As a person is facedwith change, he will evaluate or question whether or not making the change will cost a great deal inemotional stability or provide a great deal of personal benefit. It is this relationship that determinesreal, lasting change in a person. 3.34.5.  Before we go any further, let’s define what we mean by pain and pleasure in the context oforganizational culture. Everything we as human beings do in our daily lives is based on two things:our avoidance of pain or our quest for pleasure. What do we mean? Pain is the feeling of dread a per-son feels when faced with a new situation. Pleasure, on the other hand, is the benefit or sense ofaccomplishment, satisfaction, contentment, or happiness a person feels as a result of being in the situ-ation they are in. 3.35.  Reactions to Change.  3.35.1.  Shock. Once a change has been announced, usually the first reaction people have is to meetthe change with a sense of shock. They ask themselves, “Where did this come from?”, “What is goingon?”, “I did not know anything about this!”, or “This is not what I agreed to!” 3.35.2.  Anger. After you have gotten over the shock of the new situation, most people, if they viewthe change as a negative impact on their personal situation, become very angry. Many times they willbegin a process of looking for the person or persons to blame. They may begin to talk about the newsituation in very negative terms, such as, “It will not work!” or I’m not going to support this!” Thisanger, if not addressed, may lead to some people trying to sabotage the change process. 3.35.3.  Denial. This phase is a little harder to define. Many people, depending on their basic valuesand beliefs, go directly from anger to the fourth phase, acceptance. However, there are a significantnumber of people who go through a denial phase, so it is necessary to show you what to look for. Aperson going through this phase will make up excuses why he should not be held accountable for any-thing that goes wrong with the organization as a result of the change. For example, he may make theexcuse, “The change will never work because I have not been directly involved with the solution!” or“Do not blame me if it does not work!” These attempts to disassociate himself or herself from the newsituation often cause the person to alienate himself or herself from the group. 3.35.4.  Acceptance. Only after a person gets through the first phases can he/she truly begin to acceptthe change that is taking place. Once the person has accepted the change as real and that it is going tohappen, he/she begins to rationalize their role in the new situation. It is extremely important for you toAFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002105understand that people will go through each of these phases, in varying degrees, as they transitionfrom the old way of doing business to the new. How we manage this transition period is the key. 3.35.5.  What can we do to manage this transition? Change cannot be accomplished without the com-mitment and involvement of the organization’s leaders. We have talked about how important leader-ship is in the Seven-Phase Approach. As we transition from an old way of doing business to a newway of doing business, leadership becomes the glue that will hold the organization together. Let’slook at the role a leader should play during the change process. Leaders must have an assured (andunwaiverable) way of thinking about change. 3.35.5.1.  They should have a “model” that will guide analysis of the situation and help them toformulate the process of change to be implemented. Leaders must have clear goals. 3.35.5.2.  They must have a clear idea of what results the change will generate. 3.35.5.2.1.  Leaders should initiate change at the point where they have the most control andcan make reliable predictions about the consequences of their actions. 3.35.5.2.2.  Leaders should recognize that change in any one part of the situation affects thewhole. 3.35.5.2.3.  They must be alert for unanticipated consequences of their actions. 3.35.5.3.  The most important task of a leader is creating the climate that is conducive to thechange being attempted. An emotional atmosphere in which people feel that the leader is empa-thetic and nonjudgmental toward the employees and their needs is a climate in which people willbe more open about their needs and a climate in which people will be more open about their feel-ings and resistance. 3.35.6.  Implementation Strategies. Change is itself a process and must be treated as such. An organi-zation cannot expect people to change the way they have done things for years overnight. Change isnot something that should be taken lightly. It is complex and, if managed properly, can be very bene-ficial to the employees and the organization as a whole. 3.35.6.1.  Proper management of the transition of people through the process of change is criticalto the success of the new system. There are three aspects to the transition of people throughchange. 3.35.6.1.1.  Discontinuation of the old way of doing business. The first aspect of the transitionis the discontinuation of the old way of doing business. This sounds simple, but it is not. It isduring this part of the transition that many of the reactions to the change are experienced. Sohow do you get people to give up the old way? 3.35.6.1.1.1.  Identify who is losing what. 3.35.6.1.1.2.  Accept the reality and importance of subjective losses. 3.35.6.1.1.3.  Don’t be surprised at overreaction. 3.35.6.1.1.4.  Acknowledge losses openly and sympathetically. 3.35.6.1.1.5.  Expect and accept signs of grieving. Do everything possible to restore peo-ple’s sense of having some control over their situation. 3.35.6.1.1.6.  Compensate for losses. 106AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20023.35.6.1.1.7.  Give people information-- over and over again. 3.35.6.1.1.8.  Define what is over and what isn’t. 3.35.6.1.1.9.  Avoid dragging it out -- whatever must end, must end. 3.35.6.1.2.  Migration. Migration is the in-between part of the transition. You have let go ofthe old way but you have not quite gotten to the point of fully grasping the new way. It is likebeing on a trapeze. As you let go of the first trapeze there is a moment before the other trapezegets to you. It is during that time that you have nothing to hold on to. It is also during that timethat many questions may go through the trapeze artist’s mind, things like, “ Was this a wisething to do?” or “Will I be able to catch the other trapeze?” This can be a very difficult time,yet it can be a very innovative and creative time. Some things to look for: 3.35.6.1.2.1.  Anxiety/absenteeism/old weaknesses and wounds emerge. 3.35.6.1.2.2.  People are overloaded; systems are unreliable; signals get mixed. 3.35.6.1.2.3.  Teamwork is undermined; people take sides; old way/new way. 3.35.6.1.2.4.  Organizations and people are vulnerable to attacks from outside--defensesare weakened. 3.35.6.1.2.5.  The way to get through this phase is to: 3.35.6.1.2.5.1.  Recognize this behavior is “normal” and expected. 3.35.6.1.2.5.2.  Create temporary systems or ways to deal with this period. 3.35.6.1.2.5.3.  Protect your people. 3.35.6.1.2.5.4.  Review policies and regulations. Make sure they are flexible enough todeal with the changes taking place. 3.35.6.1.2.5.5.  Strengthen and encourage intra-group connections. 3.35.6.1.2.5.6.  Communicate, keep the people informed. Be open and honest about theaffects of changes being made. 3.35.6.1.3.  Starting the new way of doing business. 3.35.6.1.3.1.  This part of the transition is very important in that it is here that you solidifythe changes the organization has made. It is here that lasting change takes place. How do Ireinforce this new beginning? 3.35.6.1.3.1.1.  Be consistent. Be careful of conflicting messages. Walk the talk. 3.35.6.1.3.1.2.  Ensure quick success. 3.35.6.1.3.1.3.  Symbolize the new identity. 3.35.6.1.3.1.4.  Celebrate the success. 3.35.6.1.3.2.  Each of these ideas can be used to reinforce the new behaviors, thus, rein-forcing the new processes or ways of doing business. 3.35.6.1.3.3.  These are only a few ideas on how to manage the transition of change in yourorganization. It is important to note that there are many schools of thought on this subjectAFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002107but all have a common theme--open and honest communication is essential throughout thetransition. Section 3I—Man-hour Credit for Deployment Participation.3.36.  General Concepts.  Deployment of forces in support of Operational Plans, Aerospace Expedition-ary Forces, Military Operations Other Than War, exercises and training events are activities generallyaccepted for participation credit. 3.36.1.  Work centers participating in these activities can only receive man-hour credit for participa-tion in deployments meeting all of the listed criteria: 3.36.1.1.  Are directed by MAJCOM or higher headquarters. 3.36.1.2.  Are not categorized as in-lieu-of (ILO) forces. When the traditional force provider forthe requested force or capability cannot fill the requirement a request to the Air Force is initiatedand a sourcing solution is developed if applicable. These taskings are identified as ILOs. 3.36.1.3.  Require only a part of the total number of work center personnel to take part. (An exam-ple of this is when only three people in a 20-person work center deploy.) 3.36.1.4.  Participating personnel are on official Contingency, Exercise, or Deployment (CED)orders and away from the normal work center area for a period exceeding 20 continuous days.This eliminates sporadic, short-term deployments such as Top Dollar, Eagle Flag, Readiness Chal-lenge, area of responsibility (AOR) site visits, etc. that do not place an undue stress on the workcenter. 3.36.1.5.  Do not result in the rotating of personnel between the normal work center area and adeployment site that is permanently manned by the work center. Account for this workload in thecore POD. 3.36.1.6.  Demonstrate and document a recurring need. Historical participation data for the mostrecent 10 completed AEF rotations is needed to build confidence that the workload is constant. 3.36.1.7.  Functions not covered under the Logistics Composite Model (LCOM) may be consid-ered when computing deployment participation man-hours. Exclude contingency response func-tions whose peacetime mission is solely to train and prepare for their contingency missions.Coordinate with the functional area manager (FAM) to determine if this is applicable to the func-tion under study. See Table 3.10. for a listing of applicable functions . 108AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Table 3.10.

Exclude contingency response functions whose peacetime mission is solely to train and prepare for their contingencymissions.   AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 20021093.36.2.  Calculate deployment participation man-hour credit using Table 3.11. 3.36.2.1.  The computed man-hours account for individuals on official CED orders participating inthe deployment and gives applicable credit for the man-hours lost by the work center. 3.36.2.2.  Source of count for deployment data is the Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning andExecution Segment (DCAPES) Deployed Personnel History Database. To normalize the rota-tional fluctuations occurring with each AEF pair and across the AEF cycle, obtain deployed his-tory data equal to 10-completed AEF rotations. This will account for a minimum of two cycles.Note: Contact AFMA/MASR if DCAPES is not available at your location. 3.36.2.3.  Do not include days for personnel deployed along with, and assigned to, their own homestation’s equipment i.e. fire protection vehicles, aerospace ground equipment (AGE), etc. Thehome-station workload associated to the equipment is deployed from the work center along withthe support personnel. Coordinate with the FAM to determine if this is applicable to the AFSCunder study. 3.36.2.4.  Do not include post-deployment rest days. Rest days are given based on mission needsand are not mandatory. 3.36.2.5.  In addition, work center personnel in a non-deployment status are expected to work atthe wartime surge conditions, when necessary, to offset temporary (20 continuous days or less )deployment impact. 110AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002Table 3.11.

Must annotate the  number of ILO records removed in  CMS Final Report (Part III) (when applicable) Compute the total number of deployed-days for each deployment record (one deployed-day equals one person deployed for one day).  In Excel, subtract DEPT_DATE from TDY_RETURN_DATE.  Do not include days for personnel deployed along with, and assigned to, their own home station’s equipment i.e. fire protection vehicles, AGE equipment, etc. Remove all records with 20 continuous deployed-days or less. Compute the man-hours lost from the work center.  Multiply the deployed-days from step 7 by the daily man-hour constant of 5.29.  (Note 1)  For Fire Protection Flight only, the daily man-hour constant is 9.100. (Note 2). Compute the average monthly man-hours for a function’s deployment participation by dividing the man-hour total found in step 8 by the number of months for which data is reported (Step 1). 10  Add monthly man-hours to CMS to determine total manpower requirements. 5 6 7 8 9 NOTES:1. This  constant  reflects  the  military  peacetime  MAF  times  the  overload  factor  (149.6  X  1.077)  divided  by  the  averagemonthly calendar days (30.44). 2. For Fire Protection Flight only, the daily man-hour constant is 9.100 (277/30.44).  AFMAN38-208V1   29 MARCH 2002111Chapter 4  SEVEN-PHASE APPROACH CRITERIA DELIVERABLES 4.1.  General Concepts.  This criteria is developed as a means to support the assumptions/conclusions inthe validation process regardless of who performs the study, (e.g., In-house or Contractor). It is an advan-tage to use the criteria as a guide when performing projects using the Seven-Phase Approach. 4.2.  The Criteria. Each of the areas listed below should be addressed in a study project. The detailrequired is dependent upon the complexity and scope of the project, and deliverable products may com-bine areas as deemed appropriate for each study. If the project does not include/cover an element, anattempt should be made to explain why the element was not addressed and the impact of its absence on theoverall reengineering effort. Forward rationale for non-inclusion to HQ USAF/XPMR, with info copy toAFMIA/MIR. Figure 4.1.  Seven-Phase Criteria 1. CASE FOR ACTION  1.1. Issues driving project  1.2. Assumptions  1.3.

Comparative Analysis.—Evaluating performance difference and the magnitude of the differencebetween the project organization and the goal or target that’s trying to be achieved. Customers.—Anyone for whom an organization or individual provides goods or services. Environmental Scan.—Looking for possible factors, technologies, or trends affecting the current orfuture organization/process or may affect the future organization/process. Five Fronts.—Organizational areas that interrelate and must be considered during any improvementproject: organization/people, technology, policies, physical infrastructure, and the process. Input.—Products and/or services received from suppliers in order to perform a process. Key Process.—The major system level that supports the mission and satisfies major customerrequirements. Macro.—A more holistic improvement effort often focusing on dramatic results. Micro.—Improvement efforts focused on a small organizational scope. Mid-level.—Improvement efforts involving more processes, may be restrictive to a function or adepartment. Mission.—The reason for an organization’s existence. Primary Research.—Searching for information about a particular item using direct sources by makingdirect contact with the source. Process.—Linked activities with the purpose of producing a product or service for a customer. Typicallyinvolves a combination of people, machines, tools, techniques and materials in a systemic series of stepsor actions. Quick Win.—Minor improvement options implemented without little or no coordination. Can be done inthe As-Is phase. Secondary Research.—Searching for information about a particular subject using indirect sources suchas books, newspapers, World Wide Web, etc. Seven-Phase Approach.—A guideline designed to be flexible and adaptable to organizational needs andstudy scope and not meant to be a restrictive and inflexible checklist. SWOT Analysis.—Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. By examining strengths, a projectteam can discover untapped potential. By examining weaknesses, a project team can identify gaps inperformance, vulnerabilities, and erroneous assumptions about their existing strategies. Strengths (whatare we good at) and weaknesses (what are we not good at) are internal factors affecting a unit. Theexternal opportunities and threats are the positive and negative characteristics of the externalenvironment. Examples: Strength: Competitive Advantage; Weakness: Reduced Workforce;Opportunities: Increased taskings; Threat: Loss of primary mission.
