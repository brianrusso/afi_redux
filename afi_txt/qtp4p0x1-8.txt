Holland TABLE OF CONTENTS                                  PAGES   3 - 11  MODULE  OBJECTIVE   1.                Prepare Cost/Workload Reports       INTRODUCTION  1.  This Qualification Training Package (QTP) was developed to enhance and standardize on-the-job  training  for  4P0X1  personnel.    As  a  trainer,  the  QTPs  provide  teachable elements of task breakdowns.  The teachable elements will assist in guiding the trainee towards independent task performance, proficiency, and serve as an evaluation tool for trainers/certifiers.  2.    Review  the  volume(s)  of  the  Career  Development  Course(s)  (CDC)  and  identify which module(s) of the QTP is needed for the trainee’s job position or upgrade skill-level training.  The QTP training for each module should be accomplished in the order which most closely mirrors the area in which the trainee is working.  Items in column 2 of the Pharmacy Job Qualification Standard (JQS)/Specialty Training Standard  (STS) marked with a 5 or 7 are core tasks for the 4P career field.  Additional proficiency training may be required for these tasks at the supervisor’s discretion.   3.  Ensure the trainee reviews the training references in each module prior to attempting any  task  or  QTP  evaluation.    Review  the  performance  checklist  and  training  objective with  the  trainee.    If  the  trainee  has  questions  about  the  objective,  clarify  the  desired outcome/results of performance, demonstration or completion of the task.  Remember the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task independently.    4.  When the trainee has received sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on the objective, follow the evaluation instructions.  The performance checklist must be used as you  evaluate  each  task  objective.    When  the  trainee  successfully  demonstrates  and accomplishes the objective, document the task completion appropriately in the member’s Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  5.  The QTP task completion is to be annotated in the trainee’s electronic training record.  NOTE:  The individual checklists and final evaluations are not filed in each member’s user files.  6.    If  the  trainee  does  not  accomplish  the  objective,  review  the  areas  needing  further instruction.    Conduct  feedback  for  each  module  with  the  trainee,  and  document appropriately in the member’s Air Force Training Record.  As the trainer, once you are satisfied  the  trainee  is  ready  to  perform  the  task,  he/she  will  be  re-evaluated  until  the objective is met.  7.  If a task being trained requires third party certification by a task certifier/certifying official, the trainer ensures trainee is qualified to perform the task independently.  The trainee will then be evaluated by certifier/certifying official.  Tasks requiring certification are identified in column 2 of JQS with a number sign (#).  The certifier/certifying official will  ensure  documentation  in  column  3E  of  the  JQS.  The  certifier  will  ensure  that  a trainer’s signature is documented prior to signing off on the task in AFTR.  8.  Tasks associated with a QTP are identified in column 4D of the STS.  The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing task qualifications for upgrade training or job position training.  Such standardization benefits the JQS training concept throughout a member’s career.  These documents may also be used in assessing/certifying pharmacy technicians upon arrival at a new duty station.  9.    Feedback  is  a  vital  and  important  part  of  improving  our  educational  process  for pharmacy  technicians.    Your  first  hand  expertise  is  valued  and  feedback  highly encouraged  ensuring  we  have  the  most  up-to-date  information  and  training  possible.   Please direct all inquiries to:  your immediate supervisor.                                            SUBJECT AREA:  Pharmacy Administration  TASK NAME(S):  Prepare Workload Reports, Report of Patients, and Cost Reports  CFETP/STS REFERENCE(S):  9.6; 9.7  EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:   1.
