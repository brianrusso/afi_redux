This  AFI  provides  implementation  guidance,  and  establishes  responsibilities  to safely,  securely,  and  effectively  conduct  aircraft  nuclear  operations.    In  carrying  out  aircraft nuclear operations, the Air Force:  1.1.1.  Provides a credible operational nuclear capability by promoting a professional culture of excellence in accountability, rigorous self-assessment, and uncompromising standards. 1.1.2.  Organizes,  trains,  and  equips  bomber,  fighter,  reconnaissance,  mobility,  and  air refueling  forces  for  nuclear  combat  operations  to  support  combatant  command  (COCOM) missions  and  requirements,  to  include  exercise  participation  in  accordance  with  the  DoD Exercise Program. 1.1.3.  Conforms  to  COCOM  unique  organizational  structures  when  under  functional command  to  facilitate  alert  posture  and  centralized  nuclear  command  and  control  (NC2). This force structure is explained in figure 1.1. Figure 1.1.  Presentation of Air Force Nuclear Forces Supporting USSTRATCOM and USEUCOM (Generated)  1.2.  Mission.
