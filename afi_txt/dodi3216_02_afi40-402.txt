PURPOSE.  This Instruction reissues DoD Directive (DoDD) 3216.02 (Reference (a)) as a DoD Instruction in accordance with the authority in DoDD 5134.01 (Reference (b)) to establish policy and assign responsibilities for the protection of human subjects in DoD-supported programs to implement part 219 of title 32, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) (also known and hereinafter referred to as “the Common Rule” (Reference (c)). DoD text appears in regular font and Air Force text appears in bold font in accordance with AFI 33-360.   2.  APPLICABILITY  a.  This Instruction applies to: (1)  OSD, the Military Departments, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities, and all other organizational entities within the Department of Defense (hereinafter referred to collectively as the “DoD Components”). (a) (Added)(AF) This instruction applies to the U. S. Air Force (AF), which, for the purposes of this Instruction, includes the Air Reserves Components (encompassing the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve).    (2)  All DoD-conducted or -supported research involving human subjects as defined in the Glossary.  All such activities must include both systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge AND involve a living individual about whom an investigator conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual or about whom identifiable private information is obtained.  All activities meeting both of these conditions will hereinafter be referred to as “research involving human subjects” in this Instruction.         DODI3216.02_AFI40-402 10 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    4 (3)  Activities such as research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) that meet the definition of research involving human subjects (as defined in the Glossary), as well as clinical investigations or medical activities regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in parts 50, 56, 312, 600, and 812 of title 21, CFR (Reference (d)). a.  All research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by the Department b.  Certain categories of human subjects in research are recognized as vulnerable populations,   b.  Applicability is not dependent upon the budget activities funding the research, the mission of the DoD organization conducting or supporting the research, the security classification of the research, the location of the research in the United States or a foreign country, or whether the research is conducted or supported under a program that is not considered research for other purposes.   3.  DEFINITIONS.  See Glossary.   4.  POLICY.  It is DoD policy that:    of Defense shall comply with part 219 of Reference (c), which incorporates the ethical principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice, as codified in page 23192 of the Federal Register (also known as “The Belmont Report” (Reference (e)).   groups, or individuals and are afforded additional protections as specified in section 7 of Enclosure 3 of this Instruction.   generally prohibited by section 1520a of title 50, United States Code (U.S.C.) (Reference (f)), subject to possible exceptions for research for prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes.   d.  DoD-appropriated funds shall not be used to support research involving a human being as an experimental subject, as defined in this Instruction, without the prior informed consent of the experimental subject or in accordance with section 980 of title 10, U.S.C. (Reference (g)) and this Instruction (see section 9 of Enclosure 3 of this Instruction for details).  The definitions of research involving a human being as an experimental subject and research involving human subjects are different; see the Glossary for an explanation.   e.  Research involving human subjects covered under this Instruction shall also comply with applicable Federal and State laws and regulations.  When the research is conducted outside of the United States, it must also comply with applicable requirements of the foreign country and its national laws and requirements.  In the event of an unresolved conflict between this Instruction, including its references, and other applicable laws and requirements such that compliance with both is impossible, the requirements most protective of the human subjects shall be followed.  When there is an unresolved conflict, DoD Components shall consult with legal counsel and seek guidance from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)). c.  Research involving human subjects for testing of chemical or biological warfare agents is  5                                                                    DODI3216.02_AFI40-402 10 SEPTEMBER 2014    5.

Activities for Which an Institution is Required to Have a Federal Assurance.  Any institution engaged in non-exempt research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by the Department of Defense shall have a Federal assurance consistent with section 219.103 of Reference (c) and acceptable to the funding agency.         DODI3216.02_AFI40-402 10 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    26  (1)  A DoD institution engaged in non-exempt research involving human subjects shall  have a DoD assurance of compliance.  Additionally, a DoD institution shall have an HHS assurance when engaged in non-exempt research involving human subjects funded by HHS (unless HHS will accept a DoD assurance).  When conducting HHS-funded research involving human subjects, the DoD institution must follow this Instruction and any additional HHS requirements.  (a) (Added)(AF)  The institution should be defined in the DoD assurance at the  most senior level possible to ensure appropriate command-level oversight to allow IO/AIO awareness of the institution’s HRPP and research activities.  If an institution is defined to include groups outside the authority of the IO, the IO shall establish a memorandum of agreement with the outside entity.

If the institution does not have a Federal assurance, the institution must provide either a DoD assurance to the DoD Component supporting the research or a Federal wide assurance to HHS, Office for Human Research Protections.  Alternatively, if the institution does not have a Federal assurance, the researcher may use an Individual Investigator Agreement to associate with an institution having a Federal assurance and thus fulfill the requirement of conducting non-exempt research involving human subjects under an approved Federal assurance.  In summary, all researchers conducting non-exempt research involving human subjects must be covered either directly under their institution’s Federal assurance or indirectly using an Individual Investigator Agreement.

(T-0: OASD(R&E) approved policy)   b.  Activities for Which an Institution is not Required to Have a Federal Assurance     (1)  An institution is not required to have a Federal assurance if its personnel only  conduct research that does not involve human subjects or the research involving human subjects meets at least one of the exemption criteria in section 219.101(b) of Reference (c).     (2)  An institution that is only providing resources to support research involving human subjects (see Glossary definition of DoD-supported research involving human subjects) is not required to have a Federal assurance unless its involvement also meets the definition of being engaged in non-exempt research involving human subjects.  When a DoD institution passes resources to another institution that will not be engaged in research, but will only transfer the resources to a third institution that will engage in research involving human subjects, the pass through institution is not required to have a Federal assurance.  The institution engaged in non-exempt research involving human subjects must have a Federal assurance.         (3)  An institution is not required to have a Federal assurance if it is collaborating in a (a)  Specific tasks that do not involve research involving human subjects; or (b)  Specific tasks that do not include the collection or handling of identifiable data or  research protocol that is non-exempt research involving human subjects and the institution’s role in the collaborative research is limited to any of the following:     specimens.  Research in which the human subjects’ data or specimens are coded and the institution is prevented from having access to the code are considered non-identifiable for the purpose of this subparagraph.     conducts only exempt research involving human subjects or supports research involving human subjects must have an HRPP approved by its DoD Component that includes relevant policies and procedures to ensure compliance with this Instruction.

The IRB may approve a research protocol contingent upon its approval by other organizations (e.g., required reviews can be conducted in parallel).   (6)  An IRB, in accordance with part 219 of Reference (c), shall approve all non-exempt research involving human subjects before any activities that involve human subjects can begin.  An official cannot approve research that has been disapproved by the IRB in accordance with part 219 of Reference (c) (i.e., an IRB disapproval of a protocol cannot be overturned).  The IRB must provide oversight of the ongoing research and review such research at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year.

ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR HUMAN SUBJECTS.  In addition to the requirements of part 219 of Reference (c), additional safeguards described in this section shall be provided for human subjects in all DoD-conducted research involving human subjects who may be considered vulnerable due to their association with groups or populations specifically defined by Federal regulations in subparts B-D of Reference (h) and this Instruction.  Similarly, as provided in Reference (n) or Parts 22 (Appendix B) and 37 (Appendix D) of Reference (c), such additional safeguards shall also be provided in comparable DoD-supported research involving human subjects.  For purposes of this Instruction, actions authorizing or requiring any action by an official of HHS about any requirements of subparts B-D of Reference (h) shall be under the authority of the ASD(R&E).  Investigators, IRBs, IOs, and DoD Component personnel reviewing research protocols shall consider the need for appropriate similar safeguards for other vulnerable populations, such as:  research involving human subjects and investigators in supervisor-subordinate relationships, human subjects with decisional or mental impairments, human subjects with a physical disability, or any other kind of human subjects in circumstances that may warrant provision of additional protections.  As appropriate, qualified individuals (e.g., research monitors, ombudsmen, advocates) may be appointed to perform oversight functions or assist the human subjects.          DODI3216.02_AFI40-402 10 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    38        b.

Otherwise, the IRB Chair shall require that all research interactions and interventions with the prisoner-subject (including obtaining identifiable private information) cease until the convened IRB can review this request to approve a change in the research protocol.     (c)  The convened IRB, upon receipt of notification that a previously enrolled human subject has become a prisoner, shall promptly re-review the research protocol to ensure that the rights and wellbeing of the human subject, now a prisoner, are not in jeopardy.  The IRB should consult with a subject matter expert having the expertise of a prisoner representative if the IRB reviewing the research protocol does not have a prisoner representative.  If the prisoner-subject can continue to consent to participate and is capable of meeting the research protocol requirements, the terms of the prisoner-subject’s confinement does not inhibit the ethical conduct of the research, and there are no other significant issues preventing the research involving human subjects from continuing as approved, the convened IRB may approve a change in the study to allow this prisoner-subject to continue to participate in the research.  This approval is limited to the individual prisoner-subject and does not allow recruitment of prisoners as subjects.          DODI3216.02_AFI40-402 10 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    40        c.

Additionally, the research monitor may be identified by an investigator or appointed by an IRB or IO for research involving human subjects determined to involve minimal risk.  There may be more than one research monitor (e.g., if different skills or experiences are necessary).  The monitor may be an ombudsman or a member of the data safety monitoring board.   or concerns about the research.  The research monitor may perform oversight functions (e.g., observe recruitment, enrollment procedures, and the consent process for individuals, groups or units; oversee study interventions and interactions; review monitoring plans and UPIRTSO reports; and oversee data matching, data collection, and analysis) and report their observations and findings to the IRB or a designated official.

PROTECTING HUMAN SUBJECTS FROM MEDICAL EXPENSES IF INJURED   a.  DoD-Supported Research Involving Human Subjects.  All non-exempt research involving human subjects shall, at a minimum, meet the requirement of section 219.116(a)(6) of Reference (c).  The Common Rule does not require payment or reimbursement of medical expenses, provision of medical care, or compensation for research-related injuries.   establish procedures to protect human subjects from medical expenses (not otherwise provided or reimbursed) that are the direct result of participation in DoD-conducted non-exempt research involving human subjects that involves more than minimal risk.  Such procedures may consist of utilizing the Secretarial Designee program as described by section 108.4(i) of Reference (c) during the period of the human subject’s involvement in the research, which may be extended further upon the approval of the USD(P&R).  DoD Components may supplement this Secretarial Designee procedure with additional procedures consistent with applicable authority.  This requirement does not apply when the Department of Defense is supporting the research but is not engaged in the non-exempt research involving human subjects (i.e., when the non-exempt research involving human subjects is performed solely by non-DoD institutions).       procedures comparable to those required by paragraph 10.b. of this section to protect human subjects from medical expenses (not otherwise provided or reimbursed) that are the direct result of participation in non-exempt research involving human subjects and that are a direct result of research activities performed by DoD personnel.  This does not apply to expenses resulting from the injury due to actions performed by the non-DoD institution(s).     collaborating institution and the Department of Defense does not have the primary involvement, the DoD Components are not required to have procedures to protect human subjects from medical expenses.  For this purpose the determination of primary involvement shall be based on consideration of the type and portion of the DoD involvement in the collaborative research (e.g., research staff, human subjects, facilities, equipment, IRB, and all other assets).   that of the non-DoD institution, the Head of the OSD or DoD Component may waive this requirement to have procedures to protect human subjects from medical expenses.

Disclosure or use of classified information must comply with the requirements of  49                                                                   DODI3216.02_AFI40-402 10 SEPTEMBER 2014  d.  (Added)(AF)  All proposals to use authority under CIPSEA or a Certificate of of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes shall be used exclusively for statistical purposes, and may not be disclosed in identifiable form for any other purpose, except with the informed consent of the respondent.  Use of this authority is subject to the requirements of sections 512 and 523-525 of Reference (k) and of Reference (l).   c.  Certificate of Confidentiality.  A DoD Component or a contractor, grantee, or other non-Federal entity conducting DoD-supported research involving human subjects may request from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Department of HHS a Certificate of Confidentiality pursuant to section 241(d) of Reference (j).  Such a Certificate of Confidentiality authorizes persons engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research related to mission areas of the NIH to protect the privacy of human subjects of sensitive research against compulsory disclosure in any Federal, State, or local judicial, administrative, or legislative proceeding to identify human subjects.  Issuance of any Certificate of Confidentiality is at NIH’s discretion and is subject to the requirement of section 241(d) of Reference (j) and any other NIH guidelines.     Confidentiality must be coordinated with AFMSA/SGE-C prior to implementation.  (T-0: OASD(R&E) approved policy)   15.  RECORD KEEPING   or -supported research involving human subjects to retain records for at least 3 years after the completion of the research.
