In addition to the terms and definitions found in Attachment 1; AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program, defines other terms used in this Instruction. 2.  Air Force Goal. 2.1.  The Air Force goal with respect to Unauthorized Launch, Threat Mitigation, and Launch Action Studies is to ensure compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) nuclear weapon system  surety  standards.    The  Air  Force  studies  each  nuclear  weapon  system  to  determine vulnerabilities  to  an  Unauthorized  Launch  (UL)  and  to  pinpoint  countermeasures  to  UL threats.    These  measures  implement  the  DoD  nuclear  weapon  System  surety  standard requiring each military service to provide positive measures to prevent the deliberate UL of a nuclear weapon. 3.  Purpose. 3.1.  Unauthorized  Launch  Studies  (ULS).    Unauthorized  Launch  Studies  are  conducted  to identify vulnerable areas in a system that an agent or agents could exploit in a covert or overt fashion,  with  or  without  authorized  access,  and  to  bypass  the  nuclear  safety  and  security features of a nuclear weapon system.  These vulnerabilities could allow the UL of a missile using its own propulsion and guidance subsystems or the UL of a nuclear loaded aircraft and the  unauthorized  release/launch  of  a  nuclear  weapon.    The  ULS  report  becomes  a  source document  that  can  be  used  to  develop  a  technical  nuclear  safety  analysis  (TNSA),  and  to assess  the  adequacy  of  the  system  safety  design,  system  modification,  or  system  security features.  The TNSA supports safety studies and helps develop nuclear weapon system safety rules  according  to  AFI  91-102,  Nuclear  Weapon  System  Safety  Studies,  Operational  Safety Reviews, and Safety Rules.  Failure to prepare a satisfactory ULS report may delay weapon   4  AFI91-106  30 JUNE 2015 system  deployment  or  modification  or  may  allow  nuclear  weapon  system  vulnerabilities  to remain unmitigated. 3.2.  Launch Activation Path (LAP).  The LAP is a system model that describes actions and processes  associated  with  weapon  system  authorization  and  launch  functions,  including  the flow  of  energy  and  information  to  affect  a  launch/release.   Many  such  descriptions  may  be needed for a single ULS or TMP.  LAPs are examined to determine the relationship between weapon  system  authorization  and  launch/release  critical  functions,  and  weapon  system components.  Based on the LAP, identify weapon system components that are likely targets for attack.  LAP findings are used to determine if a LAS should be completed. 3.3.  Life  Cycle  Flow.    The  life  cycle  flow  is  a  system  model  that  illustrates  the  flow  of equipment  through  its  life  cycle  phases.    Each  item  of  equipment  that  appears  in  a  LAP should  have  a  life  cycle  flow  prepared.    Examine  all  life  cycle  flows  to  identify  likely locations and times for attack. 3.4.  Threat  Mitigation  Program  (TMP).    The  goals  of  a  TMP  are  to  identify  potential mitigators and determine which potential mitigators most effectively reduce the overall risk to  nuclear  surety  due  to  the  identified  vulnerabilities.    This  effort  can  support  the development  of  recommended  Operational  Certification  (OPCERT)  and  Decertification (DECERT)  procedures  for  recommended  operational  critical  components.    This  effort  can also  support  the  Nuclear  Weapons  System  Surety  Group’s  (NWSSG)  recommendations  for new  Weapon  System  Safety  Rules  (WSSR),  technical  or  operational  modifications  to  the nuclear weapons system. 3.5.  Launch Action Study (LAS).  A LAS is a limited-scope study or series of studies that a full-scale development (FSD) contractor or Air Force agency completes.  The LAS identifies how vulnerabilities that FSD systems or components introduced into weapon systems could be  exploited.    The  study  analyzes  these  threats  without  adding  or  relying  on  mitigating external  factors  of  the  analyzed  component.    It  also  identifies  a  potential  list  of  critical components requiring certification. 3.6.  Launch  Action  Basic  Event  (LABE).    A  LABE  is  a  unique  attack  against  a  specific weapon system component or subsystem component or subsystem that contributes to an UL.  It is  the  lowest level  at which  technical  feasibility  (including  development,  integration,  and implementation) and completion without intervention can be assessed.

Perform a semiannual validation, with AFSEC/SEW, of the master UL personnel file to ensure “M” codes have been placed on appropriate personnel.  (T-1) Section C—Conducting Studies and Preparing Reports 13.  Conducting an Unauthorized Launch Study. 13.1.  Assessing  Vulnerabilities.  The ULS requires an analysis and a report.  The analysis must  be  conducted  in  parallel  with  the  design  and  development  effort  to  recognize  and minimize the vulnerability to UL before weapon system production or modification.  Use the LASs as the starting point of the analysis.  Begin no later than the preliminary design review to provide sufficient information to the ULS team for early UL vulnerability assessment.  For both  hardware  and  software  modifications,  the  final  ULS  report  must  arrive  in  time  to support  the  engineering  evaluation  according  to  AFI  91-103,  Air  Force  Nuclear  Safety Design  Certification  Program,  or  the  TNSA  according  to  AFI  91-102.    Apply  the  access guidelines outlined in Paragraph 17 of this instruction. 13.2.  Contracting for Preparation, Conduct and Reporting of Studies. 13.2.1.  The implementing  command can  contract for a ULS or  TMP, including a LAS.  If  contracted,  a  ULWG  must  provide  technical  oversight  and  incremental  review  of  the ULS and TMP work products.  The contracting agency can serve as technical advisors to the ULWG. 13.2.2.  The implementing command will not divulge previous ULSs, TMPs, analyses, or data  to  prospective  bidders.    When  soliciting  for  a  contractor  to  perform  the  study,  the prime  contractor  and  the  major  subcontractors  or  suppliers  of  a  system,  subsystem  or component  that  will  be  the  subject  of  or  implicated  in  or  by  a  study  cannot  serve  as  a contractor,  subcontractor  or  consultant  with  respect  to  the  study  IAW  AFSEC/SEW direction. 13.2.3.  After  being  awarded  the  contract,  the  contractor  can  usually  access  and  use existing  ULSs  and  TMPs  in  performance  of  the  contract.    When  restrictions  on  access and use to such ULSs and TMPs are imposed by the government, or are a result of a third party’s  proprietary  information,  a  contractor’s  access  and  use  shall  be  subject  to appropriate nondisclosure agreements and other appropriate restrictions to protect against their unauthorized use and disclosure. AFI91-106  30 JUNE 2015   9  13.2.4.  The  contractor  must  comply  with  all  classification,  access,  and  control requirements  IAW  this  instruction,  applicable  Security  Classification  Guides  (SCG), DoD security guidance, and Air Force security guidance. (T-0) 13.2.5.  The  implementing  command  ensures  that  the  ULS,  TMP,  and  LAS  meet  the applicable requirements of this instruction and that contracts are administered so that any ULS, TMP, or LAS prepared by a contractor does the same.  (T-0) 13.2.6.  If  a  contractor  performs  the  ULS  or  TMP,  a  team  of  Air  Force  civilian  and military  personnel  will  provide  current  operations  and  maintenance  expertise  to  the contractor team. 13.3.  Preparing a ULS Report.  Use the following outline to prepare the final ULS report: 13.3.1.  Introduction.    Identify  the  ULS  scope  and  purpose,  including  assumptions, ground rules, methodologies, limitations, and applicable documents. 13.3.2.  Executive  Summary. methodology, findings, conclusions and recommendations.   Provide  a top-level  description  of  background, 13.3.3.  Weapon System Description.  Provide a limited description that is complete and accurate  enough  to  support  the  ULS  being  conducted.  For  an  addendum  report,  further limit  the  description  to  the  specific  portion  of  the  weapon  system  being  modified  or analyzed. 13.3.4.  Analysis. requirements.   Provide  UL  scenarios,  applicable  procedures,  and  security 13.4.  Report Development and Production Timeline. 13.4.1.  Provide completed preliminary/final ULS reports to AFSEC/SEW. 13.4.2.  Provide  ULS  reports  within  AFSEC/SEW  established  timelines  to  support  the development  of  TNSAs  for  NWSSG  studies  and/or  to  support  certification  need  dates. Certification need dates which drive timelines are established in applicable Certification Requirements Plans as delineated in AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification. 14.  Conducting a TMP. 14.1.  Purpose of the TMP.  The TMP defines, develops, evaluates and applies potential ULS risk mitigation techniques, procedures and requirements against the vulnerabilities identified in the ULS. 14.2.  The  goal  of  the  TMP  is  to  reduce  the  overall  risk  of  any  UL  category.    When  the calculated UL risk is high enough for concern, the PM impacted (ICBM, B-52, B-2, F-15, F-16,  F-35,  or  PA-200),  using  the  assessment  in  the  TMP,  will  recommend  mitigators  in  the form  of  modifications  to  specific  equipment  and/or  system  procedural  changes.    Most  of these  mitigators  are  derived  from  the  ULS  recommendations.    Determination  of  mitigator effects in the identified weapon system vulnerabilities supports the selection of the most cost-effective solutions for risk reduction.  This is typically accomplished through a cost-benefit analysis. 14.3.  The TMP approach for mitigator selection in evaluating mitigator effects, determining procedures,  modifications,  etc.,  to  enact  risk  reduction  is  an  optimization  process  using  the   10  AFI91-106  30 JUNE 2015 ULS results and database program to perform the necessary evaluations.  Mitigation options are  considered  for  risk  reduction  by  evaluating  their  impact  on  a  scenario’s  overall unmitigated risk value, and comparing  that  value to  the mitigated risk value.  Selecting the mitigators to use is a complex process, requiring consideration of the consequences, cost in resources (dollars and manpower), program impacts, etc.  The TMP determines and arranges the mitigator selection data for use by program risk managers. 14.4.  While total mitigation  of a threat remains rarely feasible or  economically  reasonable, various means are developed for threat reduction.  By developing and evaluating several such mitigation methods, risk managers can select mitigators based on their own set of parameters, such as cost-effectiveness, operational impact, etc.  Supportive data from ULS updates allow the  evaluation  of  more  sophisticated  nuclear  certification  procedures  to  further  reduce  the threat,  and  development  of  system  design  modification  concepts  to  be  considered  during future modifications of the weapon system, support equipment, hardware, and software. 14.5.  The  nuclear  certification  process,  as  defined  in  AFI  63-125  and AFI  91-103,  reviews and ensures each phase of a weapon system’s life cycle is conducted to enhance the nuclear surety  integrity  of  the  weapon  system.    Addition  of  a  new  mitigator  to  the  weapon  system would  impact  the  nuclear  certification  process,  potentially  requiring  changes  to  the operational and nuclear certification procedures, test equipment, etc.  Any changes must be assessed, evaluated, and integrated into the nuclear certification process so as not to degrade its overall weapon system nuclear surety.  Recommended changes to any test equipment used to certify operational critical components must be documented and provided to the ULS/TMP Working Group and SSC members for coordination and approval. 14.6.  Once  a  mitigator  is  selected,  it  must  be  designed,  built  and  implemented  into  the weapon  system.    Decisions  on  which  mitigator(s)  to  implement,  actual  implementation  of mitigation  techniques  and  nuclear  certification  procedure  changes  will  be  funded  by  a separate PM effort. 14.7.  Preparing a TMP Report.  Use the following outline to prepare the TMP final report. 14.7.1.  Introduction.    Identify  the  TMP  scope  and  purpose,  including  assumptions, ground  rules,  terms,  methodologies,  limitations,  and  applicable  source  and  reference documents. 14.7.2.  Executive  Summary.    Present  a  top-level  view  of  the  entire  TMP.    Include  a discussion on how the TMP is related to the ULS final report findings, conclusions, and recommendations. 14.7.3.  Methodology.  Discuss the approach used to identify potential mitigators and to analyze their benefits, effectiveness, and costs. 14.7.4.  Mitigation Concepts.  Describe each potential mitigator that was analyzed during the TMP. 14.7.5.  Benefit,  Effectiveness,  and  Cost.    Present  an  analysis  of  each  potential mitigator’s contribution to increased weapon system nuclear surety. 14.7.5.1.  Make an estimate of financial and personnel costs. 14.7.5.2.  Make adjustments to the technical feasibility (TF) and completion without intervention (CWI) factors for the relevant scenarios and then re-rank the scenarios. AFI91-106  30 JUNE 2015   11  14.7.6.  Recommendations.    Present  a  prioritized  list  of  the  most  effective  and  efficient mitigators,  including  an  updated  list  of  candidate  operational  critical  components. Recommend measures, such as system redesign or procedural changes. 14.8.  Report  Development  and  Production  Timelines  will  be  completed  as  directed  by AFSEC/SEW. 14.9.  Conduct TMP Studies in accordance with AFSEC/SEW UL Studies Procedures Guide. Section D—Study Report Controls 15.  Information Controls and Safeguards. 15.1.  Classify  all  information  in  accordance  with  this  instruction,  applicable  Security Classification Guides (SCG), DoD security guidance, and Air Force security guidance. 15.2.  ULS, TMP, and LAS Final Documents. 15.2.1.  AFSEC/SEW  controls  the  distribution  of  ULS,  TMP,  and  LAS  documentation. All commands or agencies must obtain prior approval from AFSEC/SEW for document distribution; e.g. ULS or TMP reports, briefings, other source data. 15.2.2.  The  implementing  command  that  performs  or  contracts  for  the  LAS,  ULS,  or TMP maintains the master copy and all pertinent data; e.g., briefings, other source data.  (T-1) 15.2.3.  AFSEC/SEW determines the number of copies to produce and defines the agency distribution list. Section E—Access Responsibility and Authority 16.  Management Responsibility. 16.1.  Sensitive Material.  ULS and TMP reports are extremely sensitive, and because access to  this  data  limits  a  service  member’s  choice  of  assignments  (see  Section  F),  it  must  be managed  responsibly.    This  is  particularly  important  in  operational  MAJCOMs  and combatant commands (CCMDs). 16.2.  MAJCOM and CCMD Obligations.  Operational commands: 16.2.1.  Request personnel access to ULS and TMP information on a need-to-know basis, keeping in mind that access to requested materials will require an Assignment Limitation Code that will restrict future assignments due to the nature of the material being accessed. 16.2.2.  If the need exists, ensure wing commanders or designated representatives (O-6 or above) receive a summary of UL risks.  Limit the ULS and TMP information received to the information they need to understand the specific threats they must recognize, and the actions they must take to counter those threats. 17.  Access  Authority.  Individuals  who  require  access  to  ULS  must  be  briefed  into  the  Air Force Special Access Program (SAP) that protects the specific details of the studies.   12  AFI91-106  30 JUNE 2015 17.1.  SAF/AAZ  has  designated  AFSEC/SEW  as  one  Access  Approving  Authority  by memorandum,  dated  24  October  2011.    HQ  AFSEC/SEW  will  maintain  a  master  list  of personnel who have had access to UL information. 17.2.  Approved  access  granting  officials  must  inform  the  individual  of  future  assignment limitations  and  have  the  individual  sign  the  Assignment  Limitation  letter  (Attachment  2), before access to information is granted.  (T-1) Section F—Assignment Limitations 18.  Extent of Limitations. 18.1.  Assignment Limitations.  Assignment limitations apply to all military who have been briefed into or had access to the AF UL Special Access Program.  To limit assignments: 18.1.1.  Enter assignment limitation codes or statements in the personnel records of each military member according to Paragraph 19.1.3.  (T-1) 18.1.2.  Do  not  use  this  assignment  limitation  code  for  any  other  circumstances  that require restrictions on duties with nuclear weapons systems.  (T-0) 18.1.3.  Keep a permanent record of their access to ensure that the assignment limitation remains for military members (T-1) 18.1.4.  Prohibit  anyone  who  accessed  the  AF  UL  Special  Access  Program  (including government  contract  personnel)  from  being  part  of  a  Two-Person  Concept  team controlling,  operating,  or  maintaining  an  assembled  weapon  system  or  an  OPCERT component.    This  includes  positive  control  (PC)  document  custodian  or  handler  duties.  (T-0) 18.1.5.  Direct  all  questions  on AFSEC/SEW or AFPC/CDN. the  applicability  of  assignment limitations to 18.2.  Permanency of Limitations.  Assignment limitations are permanent.  On a case-by-case basis, an individual can submit a waiver request to AFSEC/SEW through command channels. 18.3.  Non-Precluding.    A  person  having  assignment  limitations  can  perform  supervisory duties  over individuals in the identified positions if those supervisory duties  do not include participating as a Two-Person Concept team member. 19.  Notification Responsibilities. 19.1.  Responsibilities of Access-Granting Officials. 19.1.1.  Notify individuals of their assignment limitations before they are briefed into or are  granted  access  to  the  AF  UL  Special  Access  Program.    Individuals  may  choose  to decline  access,  without  prejudice,  if  they  want  certain  duties  that  would  otherwise  be denied.  Access is granted and limitations imposed when the individual accepts.  (T-1) 19.1.2.  Notify individuals in writing (see Attachment 2 for sample letter) of assignment limitations before they are granted initial access to the AF UL Special Access Program.  When  unsure  whether  or  not  an individual  has  an  assignment  limitation  on  file,  contact AFSEC/SEW.  The acceptance letter:  (T-1) 19.1.2.1.  Gives the individual's name, grade, and Social Security Number (SSN). AFI91-106  30 JUNE 2015   13  19.1.2.2.  Refers to this Instruction as authority for the assignment limitation. 19.1.3.  Access-Granting  Official  sends to AFSEC/SEW.  For military personnel, AFSEC/SEW will provide AFPC/CDN the letter to ensure it is filed in ARMS and an Assignment Limitation Code "M" is updated in the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS). final  signed  acceptance the letter 19.1.4.  Inform  individuals  granted  access  to  the  AF  UL  Special  Access  Program  they must stay in contact with their applicable assignment authority (AFPC, Deputy Chief of Staff,  Manpower,  Personnel  &  Services,  General  Officer  Management  (AF/DPG), Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  Manpower,  Personnel  &  Services,  Colonel  Management (AF/DPO),  or  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  Manpower,  Personnel  &  Services,  Chief  Master Sergeant Management (AF/DPE)) to determine future assignment eligibility.  (T-1) 19.1.5.  Inform  individual  that  to  decline  the  permanent  assignment  limitation  means access  to  UL  information  is  not  granted  and  the  individual's  supervisor  will  be  notified immediately.
