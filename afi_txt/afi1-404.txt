Overview.  This chapter provides guidance for conducting ESSs, preparing BSPs and ESPs.  It also provides guidance for using BaS&E to gather ESS, BSP, and BSI data. 2.2.  BSP Planning Products. 2.2.1.  BSP.  A BSP is primarily developed for main operating bases or collocated operating bases with a permanent AF presence. BSPs are prepared in two parts: 2.2.1.1.  BSP  Part  I.    The  BSP  Part  I  identifies  resources  and  capabilities  at  a  FOL  by functional area. 2.2.1.2.  BSP  Part  II.    The  BSP  Part  II  allocates  BSP  Part  I  resources  and  identifies LIMFACs  and/or  shortfalls  to  support  a  specific  OPLAN.    Part  II  development  is normally  synchronized  to  support  the  adaptive  planning  cycle  and  publication  of supporting plans.  Planning documents include: 2.2.1.2.1.  Supported/supporting OPLANs and Concept Plans (CONPLANs). 2.2.1.2.2.  Time Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDDs) including all-service data. 2.2.1.2.3.  Wartime Aircraft Activity Report (WAAR). 2.2.1.2.4.  War Reserve Materiel (WRM) authorization documents. 2.2.1.2.5.  Contingency in place requirements. 2.2.2.  ESPs are prepared for locations without a permanent AF presence and contain only the minimum data necessary to make initial bed down decisions. 2.2.3.  AFNORTH  BSI  report  is  used  to  support  of  civil  authorities  and  Department  of Defense forces. 2.2.4.  The  FDMs  will  use  the  BSP  Catalog  located  on  the  BaS&E  SharePoint  site; https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-LG-00-17/default.aspx, to  develop  their portion of the  BSP.  (T-1).  Note:  BaS&E is the mandatory AF system of record for all BSP, ESP, and BSI data collection,  storage,  and  access  and  can  be  used  in  support  of  the  CCDR  decision-making process. 2.3.  BSP Planning Cycle. 2.3.1.  All installations will maintain a BSP Part 1.  (T-1). 2.3.2.  C-MAJCOMs/C-NAFs  will  identify  subordinate  installations  required  to  maintain  a BSP Part II. 2.3.3.  Units  will  review,  update,  and  revise  BSP/ESPs  Parts  I  and  II  biennially,  in conjunction with TPFDD updates (Part II only), or when there has been significant change in the unit's support posture.  (T-1). 2.3.4.  Units required to provide BSI checklist data, will update their BSI and associated BSP Part I data biennially.  (T-0).  Note:  Recommend the FDM use the BSP Catalog/BSP, Part I AFI10-404  27 AUGUST 2015   9  BSI located on cross-reference and site; https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-LG-00-17/default.aspx,    as  a  guide  when  developing  their BSP, Part I. SharePoint the BaS&E 2.4.  BSP  Committee  (BSPC).  The primary  function of the BSPC is  to support  BSP and ESP preparation and database maintenance activities.  The BSPC will: 2.4.1.  Be chaired by the installation commander (or equivalent).  (T-1). 2.4.2.  Include the following primary members: 2.4.2.1.  Wing staff organizations. (T-1). 2.4.2.2.  Group commanders.  (T-1). 2.4.2.3.  Unit and tenant unit commanders.  (T-1). 2.4.3.  Disseminate information and establish timelines and requirements.  (T-1). 2.4.4.  Consider recommended changes and inputs received from transiting and/or employing units for possible incorporation into the BSP to include tenant unit requirements.  (T-1). 2.4.5.  De-conflict resource requirements requests.  (T-1). 2.4.6.  Validate  and  prioritize LIMFACs/shortfalls for submission to HHQ.  (T-1). installation  force  deployment,  reception,  employment 2.5.  The BSP Working Group (BSPWG) will: 2.5.1.  Oversee the status of the installation’s BSP and ESP.  (T-1). 2.5.2.  Ensure the installation SM chairs the BSPWG.  (T-1). 2.5.3.  Ensure FDMs and selected subject matter experts are the primary BSPWG members.  (T-1). 2.6.  BSP Conference. 2.6.1.  A  BSP  planning  conference  should  be  conducted  at  the  planned  operating  base attended  to  provide  deploying  units  an  opportunity  to  conduct  a  site  survey  in  conjunction with the BSP conference. 2.6.2.  The  host  unit,  HHQ,  and  deploying,  unit  representatives  will  attend  the  BSP conference.  (T-1). 2.7.  Plan  Titles.  The  publishing  organization  will  use  standardized  BSP  and  ESP  titles  that include the base/site name, location, and approval date.  (T-1). 2.8.  Security Classification. 2.8.1.  BSP Part I is normally unclassified and marked "For Official Use Only". 2.8.2.  BSP Part II is normally classified based at the same level as the OPLAN it supports.      10  AFI10-404  27 AUGUST 2015 2.9.  Plan Approval. 2.9.1.  The wing/installation  commander or equivalent  will approve the BSP and/or ESP by signing a locally-developed certification letter.  (T-1). 2.9.2.  The  MAJCOM  or  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF  will  identify  approval  authority  if  no wing/installation commander is authorized or available to approve the BSP/ESP. 2.9.3.

General.  Site  surveys  are  an  integral  part  of  the  expeditionary  site  planning  process.  Information  gathered  during  a  survey  on  a  site‘s  resources  and  capabilities  are  captured  in  the BSP Part I, and an analysis of the information facilitates resource allocation in BSP Part II of the plan. 3.2.  Concept. 3.2.1.  Site surveys are accomplished during contingency and crisis action planning. In both circumstances enough information is collected to avoid the need for repeat visits. 3.2.2.  ESSs are conducted during the contingency planning to identify data related to the site used to assess the suitability of a location for any Mission-Design Series (MDS). 3.2.3.  Contingency site surveys are conducted during crisis action planning to identify data pertinent to the success of a given operation. 3.2.4.  BaS&E  is  the  mandatory  system  for  conducting  site  surveys.    A  full  site  survey  is required in order to write the BSP and/or ESP. 3.2.4.1.  A  full  site  survey  or  BSP  consists  of  all  site  survey  information  arranged  into separate functional chapters residing in the ESP and Quick Reaction Survey (QRS). 3.2.4.2.  The QRS only opens mandatory chapters when time is critical.  Surveys viewed or authorized for checkout in QRS mode contain all bed-down capability assessment data elements. 3.2.5.  Additionally, only mission critical  data elements are  active for data entry.  Elements that are not time critical are disabled or "grayed out." 3.2.6.  Bed down sites.  An ESS is conducted at planned operating locations and possible bed down sites identified by the CCDR during the site selection process. 3.2.6.1.  C-MAJCOM/A4s  and  C-NAFs  will  identify  which  locations  within  their  AOR are likely candidates for conducting contingency operations. 3.2.6.2.  Locations are determined from  theater  engagement plans, CCDR’s staff inputs, intelligence information and other authoritative data sources. (SSMO) 3.2.7.  MAJCOM  Approval.    MAJCOM/A4  or  equivalent  will  appoint  a  Site  Survey Management  Office team development/coordination for sites that affect contingency and humanitarian relief operations in their AOR.  These include but are not limited to: threat assessments, pavement evaluation, airfield  suitability  assessment,  pre-deployment  site  surveys,  landing  zone/drop  zone assessment,  and  bed  down  assessments.    Note:      If  required,  the  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF  is responsible for obtaining country clearance prior to an ESS. to  provide  oversight  and  assist  site  survey     12  AFI10-404  27 AUGUST 2015 3.3.  The  Expeditionary  Site  Survey  Process  (ESSP).  The  ESSP  is  composed  of  three interactive processes: 3.3.1.  Site  Selection  Process.    Air  component  staffs  will  work  with  CCDRs  and  AMC planners to assess FOL suitability based on mission requirements. 3.3.2.  Data Collection Process.  There are three data collection phases: 3.3.2.1.  Pre-Site  Survey  Phase.    During  the  pre-site  survey  phase,  SMEs  research  the selected  FOL  by  reviewing  prior  surveys,  BSP  expeditionary  site  plans,  common installation  pictures,  maps  and  imagery  of  the  location.    SMEs  may  contact  the  air component and CCMD country teams for information and assistance, if necessary. 3.3.2.2.  Site Survey Phase.  During the site survey phase, the site team is deployed to the FOL  to  conduct  the  actual  site  survey.    The  site  survey  team  will  use  the    BaS&E checklists to collect information. 3.3.2.3.  Post-Site Survey Phase.  During the post-site survey phase, SMEs do an in-depth feasibility assessment of the site survey data to identify the FOL’s suitability for current and/or future missions. 3.3.3.  Data Storage and Access Process:  The AF ESSP Program Manager (AF/A4LX) will ensure  databases  duplication  is  minimized  by  sharing  databases  to  the  maximum  extent possible. 3.3.4.  MAJCOM/A3 staff will review site survey team’s FOL survey data and either approve or disapprove the site for current or future operations. 3.4.  Site Survey Team. 3.4.1.  The site survey team will include functional area SMEs from the lead wing or major deploying units, as required. 3.4.2.  Site  survey  team  members  will  be  trained  to  and  use  the  BaS&E  application  to  the maximum extent possible. 3.4.3.  The  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF  with  operational  responsibility  at  the  proposed  and/or planned forward operating location will invite other MAJCOM representatives, as required. AFI10-404  27 AUGUST 2015   13   Figure 3.1.

Expeditionary  site  survey  team  (ESST).    The  ESST  is  responsible  for  production  of basic essential data related to the site including threat assessment, airfield suitability survey, pavements evaluation, and bed down assessment.  The ESST utilizes this data to complete an ESP that can be used to assess the suitability of a location for any MDS. 3.5.2.  Contingency Site Survey Team (CSST).  The CSST will be mission specific and will focus  on  the  data  that  is  pertinent  to  the  success  of  the  given  operation  utilizing  a  specific MDS. 3.5.2.1.  A  CSST  will  typically  contain  a  smaller  number  of  members  and  work  on  a specific timeline. 3.5.2.2.  Production of an ESP is not a requirement for a CSST. It is at the C-MAJCOM’s discretion  whether  or  not  to  have  the  CSST  produce  an  ESP  during  a  contingency  site survey. 3.5.2.3.  CSSTs are groups of highly qualified individuals who have a high level working knowledge of the ESSP and its deliverables.   14  AFI10-404  27 AUGUST 2015 3.5.2.4.  The  CSST  will  conduct  detailed  analysis  of  the  information  available  on  the site/country  and  determine  what  additional  information  is  required  to  successfully execute the anticipated assigned mission. 3.5.2.5.  CSSTs collect data for a specific mission and/or FOL.  A follow-on team will be tasked to produce the BSP at a later date.  JOHN B.

Base Support and Expeditionary (BaS&E)—A NIPRNET/SIPRNET- based suite of standard systems  tools  that  enables  automated,  employment-driven,  agile  combat  support  planning. BaS&E  supports  the  expeditionary  site  planning  process  by  accurately  and  rapidly    identifying  resources    and    combat    support    requirements    at    potential    employment  locations,  providing bed  down  capability  analysis  and  LIMFAC  identification,  and  facilitating  force  tailoring decisions to reduce the overall deployment footprint. BaS&E consists of three components that are mandated for use when they are available at all levels of command. Base  Support  Installation  (BSI)—A  DoD  Service  or  agency  installation  within  the  United States and its territories tasked to serve as a base for military forces engaged in either homeland defense or defense support of civil authorities. Base  Support  Plan  (BSP)—Primarily  developed  for  locations  with  a  permanent  AF  presence, and  is  fully  developed  by  the  collaborative  planning  efforts  of  many  functional  experts  with  a deliberate planning time line. Base  Support  Planning  Committee  (BSPC)—A  planning  body  chaired  by  the  installation commander  (or  equivalent)  to  facilitate  the  development  of  the  BSP  (normally  comprised  of senior level leadership). The BSPC serves as the focal point for plan development and reports to the  commander  on  the  status  of  plans.    It  integrates  the  numerous  base-level  requirements  and functional support actions to present a coordinated overview of activity in the. Concept  Plan  (CONPLAN)—An  operation  plan  in  an  abbreviated  format  that  may  require considerable  expansion  or  alteration  to  convert  it  into  a  complete  operation  plan  or  operation order. Expeditionary  Site  Plans  (ESP)—ESPs  are  chiefly  associated  with  locations  without  a permanent  AF  presence  and  will  contain  only  the  minimum  data  necessary  to  make  initial  bed down decisions.  ESPs will be developed in short time frames to meet contingency needs without full  staffing  or  coordination.    It  is  the  installation  level  or  site  plan  to  support  unified  and specified  command  wartime  operations  plans,  as  well  as  MAJCOM  supporting  plans.    It  cuts across all functional support areas in a consolidated view of installation missions, requirements, capabilities,  and  limitations  to  plan  for  actions  and  resources  supporting  war  or  contingency operations, including deployment, post-deployment, and employment activities (as appropriate). Forward  Operating  Location  (FOL)—An airfield  used to  support tactical  operations without establishing full support facilities. The base may be used for an extended time period.  Support by  a  main  operating  base  will  be  required  to  provide  backup  support  for  a  forward  operating base.  Referred to as a forward operating base in Joint Publication 3-09.3. Functional  Data  Manager  (FDM)—The  FDM  manages  assigned  chapter  data.    They  are  site specific  and  coordinate  with  like  units  on  the  installation.

GeoBase enables geospatial analysis and the integration into business processes of USAF  missions,  installations,  and  facilities.    GeoBase  is  comprised  of  four  unique  decision support  environments:  Garrison  GeoBase,  Expeditionary  GeoBase,  GeoReach,  and  Strategic GeoBase. Limiting  Factor  (LIMFAC)—A  factor  or  condition  that,  either  temporarily  or  permanently, impedes mission accomplishment. (Joint Pub 1-02)  (Has a critical negative impact on the ability of a unit to perform its wartime mission, and require the aid of higher headquarters to resolve). Used in this publication for clarity. Main  Operating  Base  (MOB)—A  facility  outside  the  United  States  and  US  territories  with permanently  stationed  operating  forces  and  robust  infrastructure.    Main  operating  bases  are characterized  by  command  and  control  structures,  enduring  family  support  facilities,  and strengthened FP measures. Operation  Plan  (OPLAN)—1.  Any  plan  for  the  conduct  of  military  operations  prepared  in response to actual and potential contingencies.  2.  A complete and detailed joint plan containing a  full  description  of  the  concept  of  operations,  all  annexes  applicable  to  the  plan,  and  a  time-phased force and deployment data. Shortfall  (SF)—The  lack  of  forces,  equipment,  personnel,  materiel,  or  capability,  reflected  as the difference between the resources identified as a plan requirement and those apportioned to a CCDR  for  planning,  that  would  adversely  affect  the  command’s  ability  to  accomplish  its mission. Site  Survey—Physical  location  survey  to  gather  data  to  support  a  planned  or  possible contingency operation. Site  Manager  (SM)—The  Site  Manager  is  the  individual  assigned  to  the  LRS/Plans  and Integration  or  equivalent  organization  who  manages  the  site  review.  The  SM  manages  the FDM‘s permissions/access. This roll is applicable on both NIPRNet and SIPRNet versions of the application. Time  Phased  Force  and  Deployment  Data  (TPFDD)—The  time-phased  force  data,  non-unit cargo  and  personnel  data,  and  movement  data  for  the  operation  plan  or  operation  order  or ongoing rotation of forces. Wartime  Aircraft  Activity  Report  (WAAR)—Extracts  of  the  USAF  War  and  Mobilization Plan, Volume 4 (WMP-4), Wartime Aircraft  Activity (WAA) that  lists the aircraft activities of approved war plans for a specified airfield or assault strip.
