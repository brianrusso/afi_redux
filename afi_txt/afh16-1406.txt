Therefore, it is the policy of the U.S. Government to allow foreign investment consistent with the national security interest.  A company is considered to be operating under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) whenever a foreign interest has the power, direct or indirect, whether or not exercised, and whether or not exercisable through the ownership of the U.S. Company’s securities, by contractual arrangements or other means, to direct  or  decide  matters  affecting  the  management  or  operations  of  that  company  in  a  manner which may result in unauthorized access to classified or proscribed information (TOP SECRET (TS),  Communications  Security  (COMSEC),  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  (SCI), Special Access Programs (SAP) and Restricted Data (RD) or that which may adversely affect the performance of classified contracts and require a National Interest Determination (NID).  NID is  required when a U.S. company is owned or controlled by a foreign commercial firm or company  cleared  by  the  Defense  Security  Service  (DSS)  under  a  Special  Security  Agreement (SSA) and access to proscribed information is required by a U.S. government contract.  Proscribed information is defined by the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), paragraph 2-303 (Reference C): Proscribed Information                        Cognizant Security Authority TOP SECRET                                                Original Classification Authority (OCA) Restricted Data                                    Department of Energy (DOE) COMSEC                                                 National Security Agency (NSA) Sensitive Compartmented Information          Office of the Director of National   Special Access Program                         SAF/AAZ Intelligence  The  requirement  for  a  NID  applies  to  new  contracts,  including  pre-contract  activities  in  which access  to  proscribed  information  is  required,  and  to  existing  contracts,  when  contractors  are acquired by foreign interests and an SSA is the proposed FOCI mitigation method.  According to the NISPOM, the NID can be program, project or contract specific. A separate NID is not required for each contract under a program or project.    3  AFH16-1406   13 FEBRUARY 2017  Policy: Paragraphs 2-303C(2) of the NISPOM, 28 February 2006, to include Change 2, 18 May 2016, and Enclosure  3,  Paragraph  3a  of  DoDM  5220.22-V3,  “National  Industrial  Security  Program:  Procedures for Government Activities Relating to FOCI”, 17 April 2014, AFI 16-1406, “Air Force Industrial  Security  Program”,  25  August  2015,  Per  direction  of  the  Director  of  National Intelligence (DNI) SCI Cognizant Security Authority, and DTM 15-002, “Policy Guidance for the Processing of an NID in Connection with FOCI”, 25 February 2016 contain clarifications to policy regarding NIDs.   Proscribed classified or intelligence information: (TOP SECRET (TS), SAP, RD, COMSEC and SCI)  is  referred  throughout  this  handbook  as  “proscribed  information.”    The  Government Contracting Activity (GCA) requests a NID to determine that release of proscribed information to the  company  not  harm  the  national  security  interests  of  the  United  States.    It  is  the  Program Manager  (PM),  Program  Executive  Officer  (PEO)/Technical  Executive  Officer  (TEO)  who oversees the preparation of the NID; it is never the responsibility of the contractor. Per direction of  the  SCI  Cognizant  Security  Authority,  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence (ODNI) may waive the ineligibility for access to SCI of a contractor organization if a review of the circumstances shows a need to grant access is in the government interest (Ref. Chapter 5).  Roles: The GCA team consists of the PM, Contracting Officer (CO), and others as applicable.  The GCA prepares the NID justification and Staff Summary Sheet (eSSS), ensures the NID includes: Name of Company, Address, CAGE Code, Contract Number, or Program Name, or Project Name, and sends  the  request  package  to  the  PEO  for  signature.  For  non-SAP  and  non-SCI  NIDs  after  the PEO/TEO signs, the package and is sent to the supporting SSO who will forward to the MAJCOM SSO.  The  PEO  is  responsible  for  directing  assigned  major  system  and  non-major  system  acquisition programs. The PEO/TEO makes the determination for a NID and oversees the preparation. The TEO plans and executes the Air Force Science & Technology budget and portfolio in accordance with guidance provided by SAF/AQ for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/CC).  Duties are similar to the PEO.  The TEO makes the determination of the need for a NID for an AFRL contract/program and oversees the preparation.  SAF/AAZ: Analyzes all non-SCI Air Force NIDs, makes final approval, sends determination back 3.5. to the originator, and notifies DSS of concurrence/non-concurrence of non-SCI AF NIDs. AF/A2Z: Validates Air Force TS/SCI NIDs, makes NID approval recommendation and sends the determination back to the originator. The Defense Security Service (DSS): Is responsible for coordinating outside agency NID requests for COMSEC, RD and SCI.   AFH16-1406   13 FEBRUARY 2017 30-day Process: 4.1. For assistance with SAP and SCI NID processing, contact the following offices at: Collateral servicing CIP, MAJCOM/IP, or SAF/AAZX  SCI – AF-CSA: 202-767-1726, 1724 DSN: 297-1726, 1724 SAP - SAF/AAZX: 703-697-3212. DSN: 227-3212                                          5  AFH16-1406   13 FEBRUARY 2017  Chapter 1 BACKGROUND  1.1.   NID Process. NID is mandatory when a company under an SSA FOCI mitigation instrument, and requires access to proscribed information (SAP, releasable by SAF/AAZ; TS, releasable by the owning Original Classification Authority (OCA); RD, releasable by Cognizant Security Authority, Department of Energy; SCI, releasable by Cognizant Security Authority, ODNI and COMSEC, releasable by the Cognizant Security Authority, the National Security Agency (NSA)).  NIDs may be requested for programs, projects, or specific contracts. If a NID is program or project-specific, a separate NID for individual contracts or task orders under the specified program or project is not required.  1.1.2. A new NID request is not needed if a new task/delivery order is issued to continue the performance of the work (no changes in requirements, or change in scope) under a contract with an approved NID.  NOTE: In the event a new task/delivery order requiring access to any proscribed information for scope of work which was not part of the original contract, a new NID request is to be submitted. 1.1.3. Release of TS is to be coordinated by the GCA prior to requests for approval by Control Agencies of SCI, RD and COMSEC.  If DSS has proposed a TS NID on behalf of the Air Force, the OCA renders a decision within 30-days of receipt of the proposed NID (IAW, AFI 16-1406, AFI 16-701, DOD 5220.22R). The GCA's NID specifies that if access to proscribed information is  required  to  complete  pre-contract  award  actions  or  to  perform  on  a  new  contract,  the  GCA determines if release of the information is consistent with national security interest. (32 CFR Part 2004.22  [202(a)].  The  approved  NID  is  to  be  forwarded  to  DSS  by  the  GCA  (or  designated representative) IAW National NISPOM and Change 1 to DTM 15-002, “Policy Guidance for the Processing of NIDS in Connection with FOCI”, effective February 24, 2016. 1.1.4. The requirement for the NID(s) applies equally to new contracts issued to companies already cleared under a SSA with existing contracts or when cleared companies are acquired or re-acquired by a foreign interest. The GCA approves release of its TOP SECRET information to DSS 1.1.5. (dss.quantico.dss-ipp.mbx.nid@mail.mil) for coordination with the Control Agencies. (See Attachment #4 and 8, NID Request Template). The GCA is responsible for the preparation of the NID request as outlined in AFI 16-1406 for TS, Restricted Data (RD), COMSEC, and AFI 16-701 for SCI.  A separate NID letter request is required for each category of proscribed information as indicated on the proposed/signed contract’s DD Form 254.    AFH16-1406   13 FEBRUARY 2017 If a change in condition (such as a change in ownership, indebtedness, foreign 1.1.6. intelligence threat or loss of Facility Clearance) justifies certain adjustments to the security terms under which a company is operating, DSS may employ a different FOCI mitigation method.  The CSA should coordinate any proposed changes in FOCI mitigation with the relevant MAJCOM and HQ USAF office. 1.1.7. advised by the GCA that the NID not be issued. DSS implements a company's FOCI mitigation agreement without delay, unless NIDs for SAPs remain internal to USAF SAP channels only.  DSS is carved out of all 1.1.8 SAP security responsibilities and GCAs do not use the DSS NID Processing Center for SAP NIDs.   The GCA is responsible for the preparation of the SAP NID request as outlined in AFI 16-701, Attachment 4 and this handbook.  Processing a SAP NID request is further explained in Chapter 3. 1.1.9. If the (SAP) NID decision is not provided within 30 days, the CSA shall intercede to request  the  GCA  to  provide  a  decision.  In  such  instances,  the  GCA,  in  addition  to  formally notifying the CSA of the special circumstances will provide the CSA or its designee with updates at 30-day intervals. The CSA, or its designee, in turn, provides the contractor with updates at 30-day intervals until the NID decision is made.  (32 CFR 2004.22(c)(4)(iii) says: “(iii) If the NID decision is not provided within 30 days, per §2004.22(c)(4)(i), or 60 days, per §2004.22(c)(4)(ii), the CSA shall intercede to request the GCA to provide a decision. In such instances, the GCA, in addition to formally notifying the CSA of the special circumstances, per §2004.22(c)(1)(iii)). 1.1.10. The DSS’s NID Processing Center is responsible for coordinating outside agency NID requests for COMSEC, RD and SCI.  The GCA prepares the NID request letter for the appropriate agencies for each category that is listed on the proposed DD-254. 1.1.11. The required signatures for all NID request(s)/coordination approval(s) are: 1.1.11.1.  The PM, GCA, PEO/TEO  1.1.11.2.  The  Controlling  Agency’s  Approval  Authority;  each  Chapter  lists  the  coordinating agencies for the type of proscribed information required. 1.1.11.3.  The request should provide as much clarity as possible concerning the type of data and scope that is being provided.  This is to be done through the appropriate secure channels for the protection of national security interest. 1.1.11.4.  The Final Approval Authority for all NIDs is SAF/AAZ except for SCI NIDs which is ODNI. 7  AFH16-1406   13 FEBRUARY 2017  It is recommended that the GCA contact their servicing Industrial Security Office for 1.1.12. collateral NID processing questions, supporting SSO for SCI NID processing questions, and supporting PSO for SAP NID processing questions. 1.2. SCI Process. 1. It is the responsibility of the PM to work with the applicable GCA, PEO/TEO, COR and support the Special Security Officer (SSO) to ensure all applicable information and documentation is included in the NID package before it is sent to HQ AF/A2Z- CSA (AF-CSA) for coordination.  The supporting SSO submits the completed package to AF-CSA via electronic means.  When sending the completed package to AF-CSA ensure each attachment to the NID package is a separate file on the e-mail and the title adequately identifies the document.  After validation and approval, the AF-CSA forwards the package back to the MAJCOM SSO.  The SSO sends the package to the GCA, who will send it to the DSS for processing to ODNI for approval.  1.2.1. At a minimum, the NID package typically consist of the following documentation:  1) Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO) Memo; 2) PM Memo; 3) Current NID Justification Memo; 4) GCA Memo to include an AF IMT 1768, eSSS signed by the GCA; 5) PEO/TEO NID Request Memo; 6) Prime Contract current DD Form 254; 7) Subcontractor current DD Form 254 (if applicable); 8) Copy of Company SSA (DSS) certification, showing the SSA has been reviewed and meets all criteria; 9) Current DSS Industrial Security Review (conducted within the last year).    1.2.2. Ensure the memos are in the correct order as stated in this paragraph. The request should provide as much clarity as possible concerning the type of data and scope that is being provided. This is to be done through the appropriate secure channels for the protection of national security interest.

The  letter  lists  the FOCI  Company’s  location  (address),  CAGE  code,  and  contract  number  in  the  subject line.  The body of the letter provides background and justification to the GCA.  Include whether the proposed contract is part of an existing program or project.  The justification is to address and explain how the FOCI contractor’s product or service is crucial or is the sole available source to the AF.    17 AFH16-1406   13 FEBRUARY 2017  5.1.2.3. Address why access to SCI is required and who can have access to the material.  Include  the  national  security  interest(s)  involved  and  way(s)  in  which  the  release  of information  is  consistent  with  those  national  interests.    The  why,  how,  and  national security can be addressed in the NID Justification Memo.  Also, the letter is to verify that the FOCI mitigation has met all the conditions specified in the NISPOM, DoDM 5220.22, Volume 3, and ODANS 07-12 as documented in the SSA.  Ensure the SSA and current DD Form 254 are attached to the letter.  A Sample Program Manager NID letter can be found at Attachment 1. 5.1.2.4. NID Justification Memo  (DSS).  The PM prepares  a NID Justification Memo using the current DSS format addressing the need for the NID.  The current DSS NID Justification Memo can be found at Attachment 2. 5.1.2.5. GCA eSSS.  The GCA receives/reviews the PM’s letter along with the SSA and current  DD  Form  254.   The  GCA  reviews,  coordinates,  and  recommends approval/disapproval  and  forwards  applicable  information  to  the  PEO/TEO  for  final approval or disapproval with processing the NID request.   5.1.2.6. The GCA NID request should include the name of the company, address, CAGE code,  contract  number,  project  or  program  name,  specific  category  of  Proscribed  SCI Information being authorized for release, and a sentence stating whether the release of the Proscribed SCI Information to the company can harm the national security interests of the United States.  A sample GCA eSSS can be found at Attachment 3. 5.1.2.7. PEO/TEO letter. The PEO/TEO makes final recommendation for approval/disapproval for the NID. A sample NID letter can be found at Attachment 4 5.1.2.8.  The Program Manager forwards the complete package: 1.) PM letter; 2.) NID Justification Memo; 3.) GCA memo; 4.) GCA eSSS; 5.) PEO/TEO letter; 6.) Company SSA and certify that the SSA has been reviewed and meets all criteria; 7.) Prime Contract current DD Form 254; 8.) Subcontractor DD Form 254 (if applicable)), NOTE:  the DD 254 is to have a contract start and end date; 9.) Current DSS Industrial Security Review (conducted within the last year) to the supporting SSO for further dissemination; 10.) and (if required) local CI Threat Assessment on the contractor or subcontractor.  DO NOT forward the package directly to Air Staff.   5.1.2.9. The supporting SSO reviews the complete NID justification package to ensure required safeguards are in place, the DSS Industrial Security Program Review is current, current DD Form 254, etc., before transmitting to the SIO.  If the Program Manager requires assistance in obtaining a copy of the latest SSA or DSS Industrial Security Program Review, the PM requests assistance from the supporting SSO for these documents.    AFH16-1406   13 FEBRUARY 2017 5.1.2.10. The SSO electronically transmits the completed package the MAJCOM SSO who will in-turn forward to HQ AF/A2Z-CSA for processing.  Again, ensure each attachment to the NID package is a separate file on the e-mail and the title adequately identifies the document.    5.1.2.11. After validation of the request, HQ AF/A2Z-CSA sends the package back to the MAJCOM SSO via electronic means.  The SSO provides the package to the GCA, who forwards it to DSS.  5.1.2.12. DSS sends the package to the ODNI for approval/disapproval.     5.2. Follow-on  Contract:    When  a  follow-on  contract  is  awarded,  the  Program  Manager  needs  to provide  the  supporting  SSO  a  copy  of  the  new  DD  254  and  previous  NID  approval.    ODNI validates it is a follow-on contract and issues approval based on those documents.  5.3. Program NIDs:  Only one NID request/approval is required for a program NID; however, a DD Form 254 (to include where the work is being performed) along with the program NID approval is required to be submitted for each contract under the program level NID to include any new contracts.  5.4. Annual SCI Review: The supporting SSO ensures an annual review of the company’s eligibility for continued SCI access is completed.  The review verifies by the organization continues to have measures in place that preclude foreign interests from gaining access to SCI.  Annually (NLT 1 April) the GCA and/or supporting SSO will notify the MAJCOM SSO who will in-turn notify AF/A2Z-CSA immediately.    5.4.1.  Annual  Reporting:  The  annual  report  addresses  the  following:   1)  name  of company/contract number; 2) validate the NID is still required; 3) provide a copy of the current (within the year) Industrial Security Review performed by DSS, and; 4) validate the SSA is still current (within 5 years).  5.4.2.  The MAJCOM SSO provides A2Z with a copy of the latest DSS review when submitting the  annual  report.    DSS  annually  certifies  a  favorable  review  to  the  appropriate  GCA  and supporting SSO. More frequent reviews of an organization’s eligibility for continued SCI access may be required if changes occur that could enable foreign interests to control or influence the management or operations of the organization to the extent that it would endanger the security of SCI or SCI activities.     19 AFH16-1406   13 FEBRUARY 2017  5.4.3.  Any and all cases of doubt about an organization’s eligibility and desire to safeguard SCI against  foreign  access  can  be  resolved  in  favor  of  national  security  and  the  SCI  access authorization(s)  is  revoked.    The  GCA  and/or  MAJCOM  SSO  notifies  AF/A2Z-CSA immediately  of  any  changes  to  the  organization’s  security  posture  that  could  affect  the organization’s eligibility and desire to safeguard SCI against foreign access, or if DSS revokes the facility security clearance (FCL).  5.5. Office of the Director for National Intelligence (ODNI) Authority. The ODNI may waive the ineligibility for access to SCI of a contractor organization if a review of the circumstances shows a need to grant access, and it can be determined that:   5.5.1. Currently, FOCI mitigation does not involve countries hostile to the United States.  5.5.2.  Indebtedness to foreign interests does not exceed five percent of the organization’s current assets.  5.5.3.  Information disclosed regarding securities held in “nominee shares” or “street names” reveals no indication of adverse FOCI.  5.5.4.  The contractor organization’s income from foreign interests does not exceed 5 percent of the organization’s current assets. 5.5.5.  Foreign interests do not have the right to control or influence the election, appointment, or tenure of a contractor organization’s managing officials.  If there is an actual or potential element of FOCI of a contractor organization, measures are to be taken by the contractor organization to preclude foreign interests from gaining access to SCI.  5.5.6. These security safeguards are to be developed, approved, and implemented to ensure that SCI is not disclosed to unauthorized personnel.  These measures may include a resolution of the board of directors establishing procedures to preclude access, voting trust agreements, proxy agreements, SSA, agreements, and visitation agreements.  The required SSA imposes substantial industrial security and export control measures within an institutionalized set of corporate practices and procedures and should satisfy the safeguard requirements.          AFH16-1406   13 FEBRUARY 2017   Chapter 6  COLLATERAL NID PROCESS FOR RD INFORMATION (SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED ON THE OUTSIDE AGENCY POLICIES)  Recommending Authority:  Department of Energy (DoE) (approval authority remains with SAF/AAZ)  6.1. 60 day Process.

What is a NID?  A determination that release of proscribed information to a foreign owned company cannot harm the national security interests of the United States.    2.  What is Proscribed Information?  DoDM 5220, 22V3 National Industrial Security Program: Proscribed for Government Activities Relating to Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI), April 17, 2014, defines proscribed information as Top Secret, COMSEC, excluding controlled cryptographic items when un-keyed or utilized with unclassified keys, Restricted Data (RD), Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or Special Access Program (SAP) information.  3.  Who is responsible for preparing the NID?  The GCA makes the decision to request a National Interest Determination upon review of the company’s Special Security Agreement, and justification from the PM and PEO/TEO.  The GCA submits the NID request for prime and subcontracts.  4.  How do I know if a company has entered into a SSA with DSS?  Review the company’s facility security clearance record in the Defense Security Service (DSS) Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).  Special Security Agreements are listed under the Special Considerations field.  Call the DSS Customer Service 1-888-282-7682 to assist with this process.  5.  Where do I obtain a copy of the company’s Special Security Agreement that is required as part of the justification package?  DSS FOCI Operations Division at (703) 325-9167 or focihq@dss.mil.  The DSS Field Office servicing the company also maintains a copy.  6.  How long is a Special Security Agreement (SSA) valid?  SSAs are valid for 5-10 years (depending on the agreement) and remain valid during the review cycle and issuance of an updated SSA by Defense Security Service.  In addition, companies operating under an SSA, Voting Trust Agreement, Proxy Agreement, or Security Control Agreement submit a compliance report annually to DSS to address and resolve any issues.  7.  What’s the timeline for NID approvals?  According to:  DoDM 5220.22-V3, AFI 16-1406, and AFI 16-701 the proscribed information Approving Authority provides NID decisions to the GCA/GCO) as follows:  - Within 30-days for proscribed TS & SAP - Within 60-days for RD, COMSEC & SCI  The requesting unit tracks the package through the coordination process to ensure the established timelines and mission requirements are met.    AFH16-1406   13 FEBRUARY 2017 8.  If the PEO/TEO denied proceeding with the NID request, now what?  The GCA provides a copy of the PEO/TEO’s decision with the completed NID package to the relevant MAJCOM Information Protection (IP) office or Program Security Officer (PSO) and SAF/AAZ.  SAF/AAZ notifies DSS.  The GCA and PM should assess contract impact and develop a course of action with SAF/AAZ and DSS.  9.  Do the NIDs need to be approved prior to contract award?  Yes, final approval is required prior to contract award.  Reference:  DoDM 5220.22-V3.  10.  In the case of a US company getting bought out during the performance of a contract, can the contractor still have access to Proscribed Information once the US owned company is acquired by the foreign interest?  Access to proscribed Air Force information continues for existing government contracts (who still have a valid SSA mitigation in place) at the time of the buyout, while the NID is being processed.  If the NID is denied, then access to Air Force proscribed information is to be terminated.  The PM and Air Force GCA would then assess the contractual mission impact and develop a course of action.  11.  Can subcontractors have access prior to the Prime’s approval for a NID?  No.  When accessing Air Force proscribed information under the contract (prime or subcontractor) the approval of the NID is to be in place prior to granting access.  12.  The NID was approved by the appropriate authority, what is the next step?  Upon receipt of decision from approving authority, the GCA provides a copy of entire package to PM.  The GCA maintains the approval with the contract file. The contractor is authorized access to proscribed information. If denied, provide a copy to assess contract impact, and develop a course of action.  SAF/AAZ notifies DSS.                    43 AFH16-1406   13 FEBRUARY 2017  References  a.
