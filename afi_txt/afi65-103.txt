Administrative Orders. These instructions establish procedures and provide guidance for prepara-tion, issue, numbering, funding, authentication, distribution and maintenance of special orders authoriz-ing temporary duty and emergency leave travel of Air Force personnel.1.2.  General Information and Explanation of Terms:1.2.1.  Temporary Duty (TDY) Actions. TDY is defined in JFTR, appendix A, and JTR, C4451.Temporary duty at any one location is limited to not more than 179 days.  Exceptions must be specif-ically authorized by the Secretary of the Air Force.  Route waiver requests through the local militarypersonnel flight (MPF).  JTR/JFTR references preceded by a "C" refer only to civilians and those witha "U" to military.1.2.2.  Authentication. The process that makes an administrative order official.  Authentication takesplace when the signatures of the approving official (AO) and the fund certifying official and the travelorder number are placed on the travel order.1.2.3.  Effective Date. The date orders go into effect; usually the date shown for travel to begin. 1.2.4.  Authority to Publish Orders. In accordance with (IAW) AFI 37-128, commanders down toand including squadron level may publish orders.  Commanders below squadron (detachment orflight) level may publish TDY orders when a higher level commander specifically authorizes them todo so.  A commander may publish orders that are not within his or her jurisdiction only if the propercommander approves.  Hospitals and aeromedical staging units may publish orders on patients whoare members of any Air Force activity but must give copies to the patient's parent organization.  Addi-tionally, the commander or order office of primary responsibility (OPR) may delegate orders-publish-ing authority.1.2.5.  Orders Approving Official (AO). The competent authority who determines the need for anorder, requests its publication, justifies special authorizations, and approves claims for reimbursingitems not authorized in the order or which require administrative approval (the AO will not be thetraveler). This official must sign manually prepared orders or requests for composed orders.  He or sheneed not sign computer generated orders as long as the automated system is certified by the DefenseFinance and Accounting Service (DFAS). 1.2.6.  Heading. For the publishing headquarters, include DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE;complete unit designation; Major Air Command (MAJCOM) of assignment, abbreviated in parenthe-ses; mailing address; type and number of the order; and the date order is published.  Do not postdateor predate.  On form orders, type the designation of the publishing headquarters in upper case letters.On composed orders, letterhead stationery without caption may be used.  See Figure 1.1. for example.1.2.7.  Body. Write a separate paragraph for each action directed.  List all persons or activities affectedby the same action in the same paragraph.  Number paragraphs when more than one is used and divideinto subparagraphs when needed.1.2.8.  Close. The elements of the close may include the fund citation, required distribution, unit des-ignation, AO signature and title, order number and issue date. AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 200551.2.8.1.  This section also includes address and facsimile information for other DoD agencies/Ser-vices when the travel voucher must be forwarded to those agencies/Services for settlement.  Con-tact your local Financial Services Office (FSO) Travel Section for guidance when using anotherDoD component’s funds.1.2.9.  Numbering and Dating Administrative Orders. Each order must be dated. Number in order,starting with number one for each fiscal year (FY).  The servicing FSO will determine whether ordersare numbered centrally by the FSO or decentralized to the units.  If orders are unit numbered, the FSOwill determine what numbering prefix is used.  The order number will include type of order, specialorder (S.O.), series (T), and numerical designation.  Cite, above the heading of the first order of a year,the number of the last order published the previous year.1.2.10.  Citing Authority for Publication. An authority must be cited in all travel orders.1.2.11.  Forms for Orders. Compose an order when a form can not be used but include requiredinformation. Computer generated orders may vary from format established for composed orders orform orders after which they are patterned as long as all required data are included.1.2.12.  Series of Special Orders. Use Table 2.1, AFI 37-128, when assigning a series of specialorders to specific actions.1.2.13.  Information Required To Identify Personnel.1.2.13.1.  Grade, Name and Social Security Number (SSN).1.2.13.1.1.  Write name and grade in upper case letters, except as noted in paragraph 1.2.13.4.1.2.13.1.2.  For composed orders, the first time a name is used state grade or title, first name,middle initial, last name and SSN. Subsequent use will include only grade or title and lastname.1.2.13.1.3.  If the person is retired include the word "Retired."1.2.13.1.4.  Omit the SSN for individuals who do not have one, such as foreign nationals,exchange officers, etc.1.2.13.1.5.  When many individuals are on an order (for example, orders directing units to per-form TDY), make a machine roster and photocopy it on the order.1.2.13.1.6.  The order containing all the names and SSNs will not be given to the travelers;instead, a copy of the order with SSNs blanked will be provided to the travelers.  Upon usingthe order, each traveler will fill in his or her SSN.  The order containing all the names andSSNs will be used for official purposes only, i.e. FSO for funds obligation and lodging officeto verify and track customers.1.2.13.2.  Unit and MAJCOM of Assignment. Show each individual’s unit, MAJCOM, andassignment address.  When a composed order is published by the unit state only "this headquarters(HQ)" or "this unit" in the body of the order.  1.2.13.3.  Departmental Status and Component. In orders for military personnel not in the AirForce, include the departmental status and component, in addition to grade, name, and servicenumber or SSN.  For example, CAPT MARK HESS 000-00-0000, DA (INF)" or "SQ LEADERJAMES W FEARS, 5167, Royal Air Force."6AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 20051.2.13.4.  Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) Agents.

On  allforms and composed travel orders, after the name include the position title and precedence prioritydistinguished visitor (DV) code assigned to the traveler.  For example: "SES-3 Deputy Director,Material Management (OC-ALC) (DV-6)."1.2.14.  Verbal Orders. Do not issue verbal orders unless absolutely necessary.  Verbal orders areauthorized only when time or error prevents written orders from being published in advance of travel.Verbal orders must be confirmed (in writing) as soon as possible.  Include in the written order the dateand by whom the verbal order was issued and a statement why written orders were not issued earlier.For example, "The verbal orders of the commander on (date) are confirmed; circumstances preventedwritten orders in advance."  On form orders this can be included in the remarks block.  When an orderis published by an organization that authenticates orders for several units (host and tenant situations),include the unit issuing the verbal order.1.2.14.1.  Variations in itinerary will not be included when publishing orders after travel is com-pleted.  Instead, include  specific dates and travel locations. Confirmatory travel orders mustinclude the following statement:  "Submit a travel voucher within 5 workdays after receipt oforder (if travel is completed before orders are published) or after travel completion (if orders arepublished before travel is completed)."  An example of a composed travel order body follows:The verbal orders of the Cmdr, HQ AFMC, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 1 Jun 97, directing CAPTDAVID F SMITH, 123-45-6789, HQ AFMC/IGA, this stn, to proceed on 1 Jun 97 fromWright-Patterson AFB OH to Edwards AFB CA on TDY for approximately 5 days to performtests in connection with aircraft stress testing and to return to Wright-Patterson AFB OH, are con-firmed.  Circumstances prevented written orders in advance.  (SITE VISIT) TDN.  Submit a travelvoucher within 5 workdays after orders receipt.1.2.14.2.  A DD form 1610 may be used for a confirmatory order.

Rescind an order when some action has been taken on the published order, such as aGovernment Transportation Request. Revoke an order when no action occurs against the originalorder.  To amend, rescind, or revoke an order, use AF Form 973, Request and Authorization forChanges of Administrative Orders, or a composed order if AF Form 973 is not practical. Publishamendments, rescissions, and revocations in the same series as the original order.  Do not use blanketstatements such as “Previous orders are rescinded” or "This order supersedes all previously publishedorders."1.2.15.1.  Who May Publish. An order may be amended, rescinded, or revoked by the organiza-tion that published the original order.  Exception: Hospitals and aeromedical staging units maypublish orders on patients who are members of any Air Force activity, but must provide copies tothe patient's parent organization.1.2.15.2.

Such expenses are claimed on the voucher and approved by the AO signa-ture on the DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher.  (The traveler should obtain AOapproval prior to incurring expenses not previously authorized.)  Refer to FMR, Volume 9,paragraph 020204.B.1.2.15.4.4.

Sample Amended Order.AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 20059Instructions for Preparing AF Form 973.NOTE: Rescind an order when some action has been taken on the published order, such as traveladvance, Government Transportation Request (GTR), etc.  Revoke an order when no action occurredagainst the original order.  Amend an order to change data in it.  If the order is being revoked only as itpertains to some, but not all, individuals in the basic order type the words "IN PART" after you mark the"Revoked" block.  This is not necessary if it is already preprinted on the form.Items 1A through C, 8, and 11 through 16 are self explanatory.Item 2--Include all previous amendments.Item 3--(Relating to TDY).  Include original TDY action.Item 4--(Identification of Individual to Whom Change Action Pertains).  Do not use this form if the orig-inal order pertained to the appointment of a board or committee; use a composed order.  When an amend-ment applies to everyone listed on the basic order, use the statement, "same as basic order" instead of repeating names on the amending order.Item 5A--(Amendment).

When to Rescind an Order. Rescind an order when it is no longer needed:  for exam-ple, if an individual has blanket or repeated travel orders and goes PCS, completes a project, or hasa change in duty assignment.  1.2.15.6.  When to Revoke an Order. Revoke an order before it has gone into effect.  The AOdetermines when to revoke "T" series travel orders and notifies the office that published the orderby memorandum.  The AO will rescind the order with an AF Form 973, if travelers made prepara-tory travel expenses.  Officials may use a letter to cancel TDY orders and deobligate funds pertain-ing to TDY orders. When using a letter, the subject will include the number and date of the orderbeing revoked, e.g. "Revocation of S.O. T-1234, dated May 15, 1997.”  Include in the body of theletter the traveler's name, SSN, organization, and rationale for travel cancellation. The requestingofficial must sign and date the letter.1.2.15.7.  Retroactive amendments to increase or decrease the amount of money due the travelermust be fully justified (24 Comp Gen 439).  Written requests for such amendments must clearlyshow the original order was unclear, incomplete, or lacked necessary information.  Orders publish-ing agencies should look carefully at requests for such amendment to ensure the amendment and10AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 2005the reasons given agree with this Comptroller General decision.  Circumstances permitting anamendment to authorize additional payment are so rare that claims based on them are seldomallowed.  Instead, the travel claim with amended orders should be submitted to the GeneralAccounting Office through DFAS, with a statement of facts and circumstances.  A written amend-ment confirming a verbal order is not included in this category provided the verbal order wasissued on or before the effective date of the directed change.1.2.15.8.  If an order is revoked or rescinded and replaced immediately by a new order from thesame organization, the new order may also announce the revocation or rescission.  In the remarkssection of form orders, add the statement in uppercase letters:  "THIS ORDER REVOKES ORRESCINDS (ORDER NUMBER AND DATE.)"  In composed orders, make this statement the lastparagraph.1.2.15.9.  When an order is revoked, it no longer exists as an official document.  Once rescinded,although still an official document, it no longer can be used.  Do not revoke a revocation or rescis-sion; instead publish a new order.1.2.16.  Corrected Copies:1.2.16.1.  Publish a corrected copy of an order only to correct an error in the publishing headquar-ters, travel order number, or date.  For example enter "CORRECTED COPY-DESTROY ALLOTHER T-12345, dtd 5 Oct 97" (cite incorrect number and date) at the top of the corrected copy.Use the same heading and close used on the original composed or form order, correcting onlythose portions requiring correction.  Double underscore the corrected portion.  Distribute the sameas original order.  See paragraphs 1.2.15.3. and 1.2.15.4. for criteria to amend orders.1.2.17.  True Copies. You may reproduce any order or portion of it, as a true copy or a true extractcopy. Include the same heading and close as the original composed or form order, and the statement"A TRUE COPY" or "A TRUE EXTRACT COPY."  In a true extract copy, include only therequired information.  For example, if a paragraph is on several individuals, include only the name ofthe one for whom you need a copy.  Use asterisks to indicate omitted material. Individuals authorizedto authenticate orders according to paragraph 1.2.2., may authenticate true copies or true extract cop-ies.1.2.18.  Printed Information on Reverse of Orders. You may print information on the reverse ofspecial orders to make the job simpler.  Suggested order back is at Figure 2.2.1.2.19.  Record Copies-Maintenance, Disposition, Retrieval, and Review. For information on:length of orders and continuation lines, paper size, margins, and numbering refer to AFI 37-128. Disposition instruc-tions may be found in AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities.1.2.20.  Orders Distribution. For general information see AFI 37-128.  In addition, those unitsauthorized to publish travel orders must ensure a copy of each travel order is forwarded to the FSOwithin one duty day of the date published.  Faxed copies are allowed.1.2.21.  Orders Reproduction. Orders reproduction is the responsibility of the unit issuing theorders.  1.2.22.  Maximum Time Periods for TDY. Active duty Air Force  personnel are not placed onfunded TDY (including travel time to and from) at any one location for more than 179 days.  Refer toAFI65-103   5 AUGUST 200511AFI 36-2110, Assignments,  for waiver criteria or contact your MPF.  Temporary duty to attendcourses of instruction must not exceed 20 weeks (not counting travel time to and from) at any onelocation. Holidays or periods when classes are suspended do not serve to extend course duration (53Comp Gen 218).  Reserve components are limited to 20 weeks TDY without a waiver (referenceJFTR U7150 A.4.).  1.2.23.  Attendants and Escorts. Authorized types of orders that may be published for attendantsand escorts vary on a case-by-case.  For more information see Table 1.1. and contact your local FSO.1.2.24.  Forms to be Used for TDY. Use a DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for TDYTravel of DoD Personnel, when practical, to publish TDY orders.  See the general example in Figure2.1. and specific examples in Figure 2.1. and Figure 2.2..  DoD personnel include civilian employees,military members, and military retirees. Use either a DD Form 1610 or a composed order for blanket,permissive and repeated TDY orders. AF Form 972, Request and Authorization for Emergency LeaveTravel, will be used for funded emergency leave of military members and accompanying dependents.Use an AF Form 937, Request and Authorization for Dependent(s) Travel, when dependents travelalone.1.2.25.

Qualifications. Commanders must ensure their AOs are of sufficient rank and training to makesound decisions about the TDY mission.  The AO is an individual having the capability to validateTDY requirements and approve/disapprove travel requirements for mission accomplishment.2.1.2.  Determine the need for TDY. Temporary duty is conducted to meet mission requirementsonly.  Do not permit travel when a letter, telephone, message, or less expensive means will do.  Keepthe number of people who must travel to a minimum; for example, never allow two or more personsto travel when one person can do the job.  Determine if personnel near the temporary duty station cando the job.  Combine missions to carry out multipurpose results, thereby cutting unnecessary trips,number of persons traveling, places to be visited, variations in itineraries, and length of trips.  Keeppersonnel participation at conferences, meetings, and seminars to a minimum when travel is at gov-ernment expense (including nonappropriated funds) and does not relate directly to the accomplish-ment of the mission (refer to DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, for official travel not atgovernment expense). Review and reauthorize, if needed, blanket and repeated travel orders.  Ensuretravel is kept to the minimum necessary to carry out command or unit mission.  Screen requests forforeign travel to keep U.S. attendance at foreign conferences to minimum.  If possible, use U.S. per-sonnel located at or near the conference site, and assure compliance with the DoD Foreign ClearanceGuide before travel begins.  Coordinate local transportation requirements when sponsoring meetingsand conferences to keep costs at an absolute minimum, including reducing the need for rental cars. 2.1.2.1.  For off-base lodging, require the traveler to coordinate with the commercial activity todetermine if the location is tax exempt and if so, the forms and actions required to gain the neces-sary tax exemption.  The traveler will take advantage of the tax exemption where ever allowed tohelp reduce TDY costs.2.1.2.2.  When the AO has written permission to cite funds from another organization, the AOrelies upon the funding organization for guidance relevant to special authorizations and mealdirection (refer to paragraph 3.2. and Attachment 2).  2.1.3.  Modes of Transportation. Government travel will not be procured from a travel agency otherthan the TMO/CTO. Direct government procured transportation except:2.1.3.1.  When a specific mode of travel, for example, military air is directed in the order.2.1.3.2.  For limited instances of travel abroad.2.1.3.3.  When using a privately owned conveyance (POC).  Travelers should be permitted to usea POC if they desire and the mission does not require travel by another mode.2.1.4.  Other Information for Orders Approving Officials (AOs).   Provide written authorizationfor persons to escort or  handcarry classified information.2.1.4.1.  Approve requests to handcarry classified information according to AFI 31-401, Manag-ing the Information Security Program.AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 2005152.1.4.2.  Ensure civilian contractor plants and Air Force plant representatives office (AFPRO) arenotified before travel is made to those type of organizations.2.1.4.3.  Take full responsibility special authorization approvals.2.1.4.4.  Determine meal direction for travelers billeted on a military installation or when mealsare provided in a conference registration.  See item 16, Figure 2.1. and Figure 2.2. and Attach-ment 2.  Refer to AFI 34-602, Government Quarters and Dining Facilities, to determine mealavailability on Air Force installations.  Until confirmed  otherwise, presume meals are availableon Army, Navy, and Marine installations.2.1.4.5.  Ensure each travel authorization contains a statement indicating whether the traveler isauthorized to purchase transportation tickets using a centrally billed account (CBA) or an individ-ually billed account (IBA). 2.1.5.  FSO Travel Advance Eligibility Statements. Include a travel advance payment statement asprescribed by Figure 2.1., item 16y. This requirement is the result of the DoD Standard TravelAdvance Policy.  The Policy specifies the travel advance payable based on the eligibility of personnelfor a government contractor-issued travel charge card.  The travel advance will be based on the traveladvance statement (specified by Figure 2.1., item 16y). If the order does not contain a travel advancestatement, payment by FSOs SHALL NOT BE MADE UNLESS AN AMENDED TRAVELORDER IS PUBLISHED.  Note:  A travel advance is not authorized except when the mission limitsATM availability, advance conference fees are required for non-Air Force sponsored meetings and/orconferences as addressed in AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, paragraph 4.42,the member has applied for a government travel charge card and the card has not arrived (proof ofapplication required before advance is made), or when the traveler’s card was withdrawn for cause.2.1.5.1.  For TDYs over 30 days, the FSO will provide alternative pay methods for cardholders.For TDYs longer than 30 days the following two alternative pay services will normally be pro-vided to the traveler:2.1.5.1.1.  Compute an advance based on the orders and EFT the advance to the travelers bankaccount the day the trip starts.  This method requires only one transaction and the traveler willhave the money in his or her checking account to pay the government travel charge card bill ontime.  It is the travelers’s responsibility to contact the government travel charge card 1-800number to determine the amount owed.2.1.5.1.2.  Compute the advance based on the orders and suspend an EFT payment to be madeautomatically every 30 days for the length of the trip.  This method will reduce the totalamount of cash advances but will require additional transactions.2.1.5.2.  Fund estimates are always required on TDY orders when self-type (local) funding iscited.2.1.5.3.  At the discretion of the local FSO, Fund Summary Record and Program Summary Recordaddresses may be entered on TDY travel requests.2.1.6.  TDY to High Threat Areas. Annotate TDY orders when travel is to designated high threatareas to reflect compliance with the DoD Travel Security Policy. Refer to the DoD Foreign ClearanceGuide, contact the local Antiterrorism Representative, or OSI Detachment to determine current highthreat areas.  The policy requires individuals to travel by AMC air or AMC charter to the maximumextent possible, receive briefings on availability and use of fee passports by the local passport agent,16AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 2005and receive terrorist threat briefings and suggested personal travel precautions by designated localofficials prior to travel.2.1.6.1.  Military members must, and civilians and dependents may, familiarize themselves withAFI 36-2209, Survival and Code of Conduct Training, for training and education measures nec-essary to support the Code of Conduct.2.1.6.2.  In addition, atch the Antiterrorism Travel Order Coversheet (AFVA 208-3) to the TDYorders before giving to the traveler.2.1.7.  Travel Order Personnel Tempo (PersTempo) Codes.   Include, in the “Remarks” block ofthe order, the appropriate “Travel Order PersTempo Code” and corresponding definition title listed inTable 2.1.  This code is used in the voucher settlement process to flow information back to the person-nel system.  Additional information on the Duty Status Codes that fall under each “Travel Order Per-sTempo Code” can be found in AFI 36-2134.  A travel voucher supported by an order that does nothave a “Travel Order PersTempo Code” will be processed as an “Q” Travel Order PersTempo Codeduring settlement.  This travel will not accumulate for the payment of high-deployment (BurdensomeTempo) pay.AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 2005Table 2.1.

Example of a Composed Blanket Travel Order: COL  MARALIN  C  DEWEY,123-45-6789, this HQ, will proceed at such  times as may be necessary during the period 1 Oct 97to 30 Sept 98, both dates inclusive, from Wash DC to any point within continental limits of theU.S. on TDY in connection with duty as Director of Administration; and upon completion of eachmission will return to Wash DC. (Speech or Presentation).  Since your per diem is based on theavailability of billeting and mess, when TDY to military installations contact the base billetingofficer to see if they are available.  Government meals are directed.  Accept no promotional items,for example, gifts, bonus tickets, etc. (Cite the proper accounting classification and customer iden-tification code.)  Items 1 and 2b through 5 on reverse apply.  Authority AFI 36-2110.2.3.3.  Endorsement to Blanket TDY orders. Special authorizations (paragraph 3.2.) requiring writ-ten justification will not be included in the basic order.  These authorizations, when required for a spe-cific trip, must be added by endorsement to the original order and signed by the AO.  Maintain anddispose of any written justification IAW AFI 37-128.  In addition, air movement designators, portreporting instructions, excess baggage, foreign flag carrier certificates, ordinary leave, and overseasarea clearance may be added by endorsement.  When circumstances of a specific trip require the trav-eler to obtain a travel advance payment, the blanket travel order must be endorsed with the appropriatetravel advance payment statement prescribed by Figure 2.1., item 16y and signed by the AO.2.3.4.  BTO Review. The installation FSO will review BTOs annually, normally when organizationsare preparing new orders for the FY.  Review will ensure orders are administratively correct.  Also, theFSO must ensure BTO criteria are met and make a recommendation through the appropriate chain ofcommand to the AO for approval/disapproval of the BTO.  Additionally, MAJCOM-FOA/DRU/FMwill make BTOs an item of interest during staff assistance visits and inspector general inspections.2.3.5.  BTO Travel Advance. Cash advance requirements while in a travel status will be met byusing ATMs.  FSOs will only issue travel advance payments when circumstances of a specific tripnegate the use of the government travel charge card.  In this instance, the BTO must be endorsed withthe appropriate travel advance payment statement prescribed by Figure 2.1., item 16y.30AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 2005Figure 2.3.  Sample Blanket Travel Order.AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 200531Instructions for Blanket Travel Orders.Blanket orders differ from other orders because they can be used over and over again for an extended period.  They are intended for people whose official duties require frequent travel with little advance notice.  Below are some differences from routine orders.Item 9.  Purpose for which this order was approved.  If the traveler goes TDY for a purpose other than indicated, a separate one-time routine order must be issued.  For example, Colonel Twinkle is selected to sit on a promotion board at Randolph AFB.  Since this travel does not relate to normal Air Combat Com-mand activities, a separate order must be prepared.  When selecting the type and category of travel, select the ones that best fit the majority of the trips likely to be taken.Item 10a.  This item is left blank.Item 10b.  Instead of a single date like on a routine TDY order, put in the note earlier than (NET) and the not later than (NLT) dates.  This represents the period the order can be used.  As in routine orders, a 7 day window before and after the proceed O/A date applies.  You can make the order good for any period of time, for example, a month, a quarter, etc., as long as the date and travel does not run into the next FY.Item 11.  Variations are never allowed on a blanket order.  In the “TO” portion of the itinerary specify the geographic limitations where travel is authorized.Item 12.  Usually this item will be blank unless only one mode will satisfy all trips to be taken.  Never mark the block for more advantageous to the government as it would be a special authorization and must be added by endorsement.Item 16.  In general, except for the first statement in this order, put in the same information as in routine orders.  One difference is that if the traveler will procure his or her own transportation or will use a POC as not more advantageous to the government, the cost provided by the TMO for commercial transporta-tion has to be added by endorsement.  Billeting and mess may vary since the traveler may go to other than military installations conducting varying missions.  Include the meal's statement contained in Figure 2.1., item 16a (all three options).  The traveler will inform the AO which item applied after the fact and the AO will circle and sign the correct choice before the traveler files the travel voucher. SUGGESTED REVERSE OF BLANKET TRAVEL ORDER (NOTE:  Only items indicated in remarks (item 16) of the order apply.)1.  Before traveling, comply with the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide for clearance, passport, and immuni-zation requirements.2.  Member is cleared for access to classified material up to and including (a) SECRET (b) TOP SECRET.3.  Within overseas area of TDY, travel by military and commercial aircraft, commercial rail, and bus is authorized.4.  Before traveling outside CONUS by AMC scheduled aircraft, include in these orders a statement that the member will report to APOE NLT 1 1/2 hours before scheduled departure time, flight number, and departure time assigned by TMO.  The local priority issuing agency provides return information.5.  Each of the following is authorized when this order is endorsed for a specific trip by an authorized offi-cial, making the specific authorization(s) applicable:a.  Travel by privately owned conveyance authorized.  This mode of transportation determined more advantageous to the government.32AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 2005b.  Hire of special conveyance (as specified in the endorsement) for use within area of TDY station determined more advantageous to the government.6.  The following statement will be used when order is endorsed for a specific trip by an authorized offi-cial after it has been approved by the Secretary of the Air Force:  "Travel is authorized by first class com-mercial air during the period (dates) per approval of Secretary of the Air Force (date approved)."7.a) All government meals are available and directed. b) Partial government meals are available and directed.c) Government meals are not available or directed.____________________2.4.  Repeated TDY Orders. Repeated TDY orders allow any necessary number of separate round tripsfrom the permanent duty station (to and from), or between specified locations.  Each separate journey mayrequire stopover for duty at one or more places before returning to the permanent duty station (PDS).Travel must not be solely between place of duty and lodging/home.  Normally, government meals aredirected until adjusted by the AO after the TDY.2.4.1.  Special Instructions. "Specified locations" means the TDY locations must be listed in theorder. Do not authorize variations in itinerary in repeated orders. If the number of trips for a periodwill be exceeded, amend the repeated order or publish separate orders for the excess trips.  RepeatedTDY orders continue in effect until expiration or rescission.  Repeated TDY orders are only effectiveduring one FY and will not be used for any one trip in excess of 179 days.  If a trip goes into a new FY,publish a second order to cover that portion.  They may be endorsed as described in paragraph 2.5.  Ifrepeated orders are required for the same people in the next FY, publish new orders.  The fund certifi-cation official must initial the request for orders, indicating funds are available and the accountingclassification code is accurate.  No funding codes are used on repeated transportation authorizationseven when they are for space required nonreimbursable travel.2.4.2.  Authority for Publication. Repeated TDY orders may be published by any commanderauthorized to publish travel orders.  These orders require the same general information prescribed inFigure 2.1.  In addition, include the effective and expiration dates of the order and specify the numberof round trip journeys that may be taken.  See Figure 2.4. for a sample repeated travel order.AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 200533Figure 2.4.

Who May Endorse. Orders must be endorsed by the AO who issued the original order, or alower echelon when authorized by a higher headquarters (for example, OSI district offices).  Com-manders of aeromedical staging units may endorse patient travel orders when the change is directedby the Armed Services Medical Regulating Officer (ASMRO).  Copies of the endorsement must befurnished to the order originator, organization of original destination, and gaining medical facility.2.5.2.  How To Endorse. Endorse composed orders below the body or on the reverse if space is notavailable.  Do form orders on the composed orders below the body or on the reverse if space is notavailable.  Do form orders on the reverse if possible or use a separate page.

Permissive or No Expense to Government Orders. Permissive orders allow members to be awayfrom their PDS without being charged leave.  There is no reimbursement for travel.  Most permissivetravel for military  members will be done on an AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization. However,in some cases, a DD Form 1610 or a composed order is used.  To determine if a travel order must be usedsee AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, and JFTR, paragraph U7650.2.6.1.  Operation Bootstrap TDY. See AFI 36-2306, The Education Services Program.  For Boot-strap, permissive in conjunction with PCS or TDY, or travel involving reimbursement from a nonap-propriated fund, continue to use the DD Form 1610.  Include the same general information as anyTDY, except you must specify number of days, including travel time.  Include the following state-ments:  “Submit a no-pay travel voucher within 5 workdays after completion of travel.  Travel permit-ted by this order does not entitle traveler to expenses or travel or per diem. Individual is on authorizedabsence from duty traveling at personal expense and eligible for military furlough fare discounts.Absence in excess to number of days authorized is chargeable to leave.”  Include the opening andclosing of the term (or terms) involved.  Furnish a copy of the orders to the proper FSO.  See samplepermissive order at Figure 2.5.2.6.2.  Permissive Orders - Military Personnel. Authority AFI 36-3003 (JFTR, paragraph U7650).Military personnel traveling on permissive TDY orders are permitted space available travel byDoD-owned or controlled aircraft. NOTE: Permissive TDY for house-hunting terminates upon acceptance of housing and further absencefrom duty is charged as leave. 38AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 20052.6.3.  Travel at No Expense to Government-Civilian Personnel. Authority    JTR,  paragraphC6250.  When an employee agrees to pay his or her own expense, if travel at government expense isnot authorized, for attendance at a meeting of a technical, professional, scientific, or other similarorganization and it has been determined the employee will be in a duty status, issue a permissiveTDYorder.  The order must state travel is at the employee's request.2.6.4.  When Order Not Used. The traveler's supervisor or competent authority must verify the trav-eler's signed statement that travel was not performed.  Send the statement and a copy of the order tothe proper FSO.  There is no need to revoke the order since funds are not involved.2.6.5.  Travel by POV. This mode may be authorized as a convenience to the traveler if it will notincrease the total cost to the government.  An example would be a member traveling to a permissiveTDY station (in a nonpay travel status) during a time in which he or she would not usually be sched-uled for duty.2.7.  NATO Travel Orders. These orders are to be used only for military personnel movement, their per-sonal baggage, individual weapons, and official documents.  Use AF Form 1631, NATO Travel Order,or a composed order.

Special Instructions. The NATO travel order must be printed in English and French.  Includeadditional languages if required under national agreements.  You may print it on the reverse of thebasic order if practical.2.7.2.1.  The NATO travel order should be used for both individual and group travel.  If more thanone person is traveling, list them by rank, name, SSN, and unit on the face or reverse of the orderor on a separate sheet of paper.2.7.2.2.  The NATO travel order is numbered with the same number as the individual's basic travelorder.  Give one or more copies to the traveler.  You need not make more copies for file, record, orother purposes, unless the MAJCOM requires it.2.7.2.3.  You must complete paragraphs 1 and 2 of these orders.  Only use paragraphs 3 and 4when necessary.2.7.2.4.  You may reproduce and fill them in as required.2.7.2.5.  When frequent travel is required, you may publish the NATO travel order for a periodcorresponding to a basic blanket or repeated order.2.7.2.6.  NATO orders will be prepared when destination is classified.  Destination will not beshown in item #2 of the basic order.AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 2005392.8.  Partnership for Peace (PFP) Countries. To travel in PFP countries, Air Force members are onlyrequired to posess a DD Form 1610 and a valid identification card.

Sample NATO Travel Order.AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 200541Chapter 3  GENERAL GUIDANCE3.1.  Separate Orders Involving Travel. When a single Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC)number applies to a group of individuals traveling on TDY, include the number in the accounting classifi-cation.  If a single RC/CC number does not apply, prepare a separate order for each person, or place thenumber after each name, for example:  "MAJ W J SMITH, 000-00-0000."  RC/CC 100314.”  Indicate theomission of the RC/CC in the accounting classification by using brackets, for example, "57*3400 30*4312 (xxxxxx)  409 503700" and include a statement in the body of the composed orders, or in the"Remarks" item of form orders "RC/CC number is indicated after each traveler's name."3.2.  Special Authorizations. A special authorization is something that adds to the cost of normal traveland will only be requested when needed to accomplish the mission.  When travel cannot be made by nor-mal transportation modes, or when special authorizations are required to carry out travel, comply with therestrictions in the following paragraphs.3.2.1.  Statement for Orders. To indicate special authorizations desired and that a cost analysis hasbeen accomplished, the following statement must be included in the "remarks" section of the order:"Special authorization(s) for (rental cars, use of privately owned conveyance, excess baggage, etc.) is/are required for mission accomplishment.  The cost of the special authorization(s) has been reviewedand is justified as more advantageous to the government or necessary for mission accomplishment."The AO or commander's signature in the AO section of the order indicates actual approval of the spe-cial authorization.3.2.2.  Justifications. Justifications for special authorizations must be based on advantage to the gov-ernment.  Convenience to the traveler is never a reason for approving a special authorization.  Factorsto be considered in determining if special authorizations are an advantage to the government, includebut are not limited to:3.2.2.1.  Requirements of the mission assignment.3.2.2.2.  Availability of all types of transportation modes and effect on productive time related tothe travel time involved.3.2.2.3.  Need to transport additional baggage, tools, or equipment.3.2.2.4.  Location of places of temporary duty in relation to location of lodging and meal facilitiesand availability of transportation between these points.3.2.2.5.  Total cost to the government (includes per diem, lost work time, salary of civilianemployees, and actual transportation).3.2.2.6.  Duty locality in relation to traffic conditions, routing, and weather.3.2.2.7.  Overall cost advantage when there are accompanying passengers under official travelorders in the same privately owned conveyance.3.2.2.8.  Documentation (letters, messages, etc.) used to justify a special authorization is consid-ered background material and will be maintained and disposed of according to AFI 37-128.42AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 20053.2.2.9.  If a special authorization does not apply to all travelers, the order must state to whom itapplies.3.3.  Nonuse of Government Facilities:3.3.1.  MAJCOM Supplements. MAJCOM supplements to this AFI may include specific circum-stances where commanders may issue adverse effect statements covering duty requirements that donot permit use of government facilities.3.3.2.  Nonuse of Government Facilities. Before orders are published, the traveler or project officermust request and obtain approval for nonuse of government facilities if billeting is available on theTDY installation.3.3.3.  Authorizing Officials. Wing or group commanders may authorize nonuse of governmentfacilities, in individual cases, when conditions justify it, but the commander at the TDY location doesnot agree to issue an impracticability statement.  This authority must be issued with care.  Letterrequest must cite this subparagraph and also state the impracticality condition.  If known in advanceof the TDY, the authorization will be included in the TDY order using the statement in 3.3.5. below.3.3.4.  Statement of Adverse Effect -- Nonuse of Government Facilities. If a traveler finds govern-ment facilities cannot be used without adversely affecting the mission, the AO signs the DD Form1351 approving the change if appropriate.  For simple changes in meal direction (see Attachment 2and Figure 2.1.) the approval is done on the order back.  For exercises, the exercise commander (orequivalent, such as team leader) is provides a memorandum to the AO indicating circumstances pro-hibiting use of government facilities.  If appropriate, the AO signs the DD Form 1351 approving thechange.  For FSO documentation requirements as a basis for payment of increased per diem, retainsupporting documents as background material.3.3.5.  Nonuse Statement. If it is known in advance that use of government quarters would adverselyaffect mission performance, use the following statement in the TDY order:  "Use of government quar-ters will adversely affect (the mission) (performance of duties) (at     ), or (for the period    )."  If uniqueor specialized billeting requirements exist, orders will include a statement to that effect.3.3.6.  AETC and AFIT Fund Citations. AETC and AFIT authorizes other organizations to citetheir funds in orders.  This covers only normal allowances.  If special authorizations are needed, theAO must get approval before putting them in the order IAW AFCAT 36-2223.3.3.7.  Special Conveyances AFI 24-101:3.3.7.1.  Motor vehicle. When a motor vehicle is rented for the exclusive use of one or more per-sons, it is a special conveyance. Select the rental service permitting the mission to be carried out atlowest overall cost.  Traffic management officers (TMO), Commercial Travel Office (CTO) orScheduled Airline Traffic Offices (SATO) will make arrangements for travelers.  See AFI 24-101for procedures. 3.3.7.2.  Statements for Authorizing Special Authorizations in Orders. Special authorizationsmust be authorized in the TDY order.  Following are examples of statements used: 3.3.7.2.1.  "Hire of special conveyance for use within area of TDY station authorized as moreadvantageous to the government."AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 2005433.3.7.2.2.  "Hire of special conveyance authorized as more advantageous to the government."Use this statement when use is not restricted to the area of the TDY station; for example, it isin a remote area where adequate common carrier transportation is not available.3.3.7.2.3.  When variations in itinerary are authorized or there is more than one TDY point,indicate the actual location (or locations) where special conveyance will be used.  For exam-ple: "Hire of special conveyance within area of (location of TDY) authorized as more advan-tageous to the government."3.3.7.3.  The AO should ensure traveler is briefed on specific guidance concerning rental vehicles(see AFI 24-101).3.3.8.  Fly-It-Yourself Aircraft. Fly-it-yourself aircraft must be authorized in orders as a special con-veyance. Persons who use fly-it-yourself aircraft for personal convenience need not have special con-veyance authorized in orders.3.3.8.1.  In orders for fly-it-yourself aircraft if a special conveyance is to be hired, include:  "Hireof fly-it-yourself aircraft as a special conveyance authorized between______ and _______ asmore advantageous to the government."3.3.8.2.  Include in the order "Contact your TMO who is required to arrange for the hire offly-it-yourself aircraft." (JFTR, paragraph U3415B, and JTR, paragraph C2102.2).NOTE: AOs do not authorize private aircraft to carry passengers, unless the pilot has a commercialpilot's license (AFI 24-101) or a private pilot's license and are also instrument rated.  This requirementdoes not apply to Aero Club aircraft.3.3.9.  Extra Fare Train (AFI 24-101). Statement for orders:  "Travel is authorized by extra faretrain."3.3.10.  Privately Owned Conveyance (Including Privately Owned Aircraft) Ad vantageous tothe Government (JFTR, paragraph U3305 and JTR paragraph C2151).  Statement for orders:"POC.  This mode has been determined more advantageous."3.3.11.  First Class Air Accommodations (JFTR, paragraph U3125 and JTR, para graphC2204).  Statement for orders:  "Travel is authorized by first class commercial air per approval of Sec-retary of the Air Force."NOTE: When first class evening fares do not cost more than normal day coach fares, they do not requirea special authorization.3.3.12.  Commercial Air to and From CONUS (AFI 24-101). Statement for orders:  "Travel autho-rized by commercial air per approval of  ______     ."  3.3.13.  Travel Within and Around Duty Station (JTR, Paragraph U3500 and C2400).    State-ment for orders: "Reimbursement of transportation expenses necessarily incurred in the conduct ofofficial business in and around a temporary duty station is authorized."3.3.14.  Excess Accompanied Baggage Allowance Authorization.3.3.14.1.  When excess accompanied baggage allowance has been approved, include in travelorders:  “___ pieces excess accompanied baggage authorized according to AFI 24-101."3.3.14.2.  To authorize excess accompanied baggage for dependents traveling by AMC aircraft,include:  "     pieces excess accompanied baggage authorized for each dependent, according to AFI44AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 200524-101."  For travel by AMC aircraft, excess accompanied baggage must be stated only in pieces.For travel by commercial air, the excess accompanied baggage must be stated in terms of poundsand pieces, depending on the carrier's allowance as determined by TMO.  For travel by othermodes, see AFI 24-101.3.3.15.  Shipment of Household Goods (HHG) Under Military TDY Orders.

If travelers personally arrange and pay for tran-soceanic travel, they may not be reimbursed unless it is authorized in their orders.  A special authori-zation must be approved.  The "letter request" will first be routed through TMO and approved by thetraveler’s squadron commander.  Approval authority will not be further delegated. State on the orders:"Traveler authorized to personally procure transoceanic transportation."3.4.  Variations in Itinerary. This permits omission of travel to a place (or places) stated in a travelorder; changes in the order of travel to places shown; and travel to places not shown. It is not used in placeof adequate advance planning nor is it interpreted as granting blanket travel authorization.  It is permittedonly when essential to the success of the mission.3.4.1.  When Variations are not Authorized.  3.4.1.1.  Do not use variations because of probable flight changes caused by weather, mechanicalfailure, or requirement to remain overnight at other than duty points.  3.4.1.2.  When purpose of TDY is to attend a technical, scientific or professional meeting. 3.4.1.3.  When purpose of TDY is to attend a school or course of instruction, except when unspec-ified field trips or flight training outline or AFCAT 36-2223.  3.4.1.4.  On a PCS order, except in TDY enroute.  3.4.1.5.  In an amendment to an order after travel is completed (see paragraph 1.2.14.1.).NOTE: Variations in overseas travel do not exempt requirements for foreign area clearances.3.5.  Classified Orders. You can often avoid classification with careful wording, especially in duty to beperformed. For example, if the purpose is to inspect a piece of classified ordnance, the order may read:"To inspect ordnance material."  This statement gives the purpose as official Air Force business, but doesnot identify the classified equipment being inspected.  Also, to avoid classifying an order if TDY is at aclassified location.  Include the name of a nearby location in the itinerary if the rate of per diem is thesame and authorize variations in itinerary. When an order must be classified, mark and handle it accordingto AFI 34-401.  You may also make extract copies using asterisks in place of the classified data.  Whenpresenting orders to unofficial agencies such as rental car companies, hotels, etc., it is permissible todelete or obliterate certain data such as grade, position, title, security clearance, and purpose of travel.Although this data in itself is not classified, it may be sensitive in the wrong hands.NOTE: In using a nearby location, ensure you do not inadvertently identify classified data; e.g., the the-ater of operations, if classified, or other classified or security related data associated with deploymentoperations.  Always check the latest security classification guidance to ensure you are not disclosing clas-sified information when completing the orders.AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 200545Chapter 4  CIVILIAN TRAVEL, TRANSPORTATION AUTHORIZATIONS,  DEPENDENT TRAVEL, INVITATIONAL TRAVEL, EMERGENCY LEAVE, AND SUBPOENA TRAVEL4.1.  Civilian Travel Orders. DD Form 1610 is used for DoD civilian travel.  In rare cases where it is notpractical to use printed forms, you may compose orders. Instructions for completing these forms are inJTR, paragraph C3150 and in Figure 2.1.4.2.  Transportation Authorizations.

On 1 Oct 96, a change to the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) and Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) introduced the PPD rate as an additional means of determining meal reimbursement for TDY travelers.  It occurred in conjunction with a scheduled reduction in surcharge rate assessed in military dining facilities and a determination that most dining facilities are open to all TDY travelers, officers and civilians included, as listed in AFI 34-602. PPD was created:  a.  To coincide with a surcharge reduction in military dining facilities, reducing the cost from $18.15 to $7.00 per day.b.  To bring parity between officer and enlisted per diem.c.  Remove cumbersome meal counting for determining per diem.2.  Previously, TDY travelers were either reimbursed for meals at the government meal rate, at the locality rate; or at a meal-by-meal rate. Meal-by-meal rate was replaced by PPD which is a “middle rate” of per diem designed to adequately reimburse members who eat one or two meals in a government dining facil-ity.  It is computed by adding the locality (meal) rate to government (meal) rate and dividing by two. Note:  Travel days are still computed using 75% of the locality rate no matter dining hall availability or meal direction.3.  The AO decides which per diem is applicable.  The AO marries meal availability in AFI 34-602 with mission requirements to determine which rate applies: locality, PPD, or government rate.  Rank or posi-tion is not a determination of per diem since the new procedures apply to both officers and enlisted per-sonnel. 4.  The AO must select one of three options listed on all travel orders:a.  All government meals are available and directed.b.  Partial government meals are available and directed.c.  Government meals are not available or directed.5.  If the traveler finds out meal availability has changed or the mission didn’t allow consuming meals in the dining hall as directed by the AO, the AO may make changes to the orders after the fact to reimburse the traveler at a higher rate.  The AO makes changes, if warranted, based upon a reasonable request by the traveler.  See Figure 2.1. for guidance on making changes to orders after the fact. Some (but not all) fac-tors that may necessitate a change:a. Billeting availability changes and the traveler must be billeted off base.  In this instance, the FSO automatically pays the locality rate and no annotation is required by the AO or traveler.  Nonavail-ability information is required.b.  Dining hall hours/availability were different than originally understood.c.  Mission required abnormal work hours.d.  Eating at the dining hall was too difficult given distance and transportation considerations. 6.  If the AO fails to make the mandatory meal determination on the travel orders, the FSO may send the orders back for correction if that task may be completed before travel occurs.  If the AO fails to make a AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 200565meal determination and the orders aren’t corrected before travel occurs, the locality rate applies unless a meal was provided with a conference and that fact was not known before travel.  The FSO will confer with the AO if meal direction does not appear in blanket travel orders.  7.  If a military member is lodged off-base, the AO may not direct use of the government mess and the member receives the full locality rate. However, the military member may consume meals in the dining hall without a reduction in per diem even if allowed the locality rate.  No stigma is attached to the military member for eating in dining halls although not directed to do so.8.  Civilians may not be required to eat in a military dining facility but may eat in dining facilities if they wish.  Their per diem is reduced to the PPD rate or the government rate if they consume meals in a gov-ernment mess and they must claim the meals on their travel voucher.9. Both civilians and military are subject to lower per diem, as applicable, if meals are provided in con-junction with a conference, exercise, or deployment.  If all three meals are provided, the incidental rate applies.10. Military are paid PPD for travel less than 10 hours and meal(s) are claimed (excluding the $2 CONUS, or $3.50 OCONUS incidental expenses).  The “occasional meal” has been replaced by PPD.  75% of the locality rate is paid for TDYs over 10 hours. Civilians are not paid for meals when the TDY is less than 12 hours.11. If not contacted before the TDY, government mess is considered available at other services’ installa-tions.  12.  For blanket orders, the AO directs government meals and then adjusts, as necessary after the TDY as in other travel.  This policy is IAW per diem committee guidance to only increase entitlements after the fact, never decrease.  13.  PPD rules apply to Contingency/Exercise/Mobility (CEM) and flight orders. The OpPlan for the par-ticular exercise states what reporting instructions will be used as far as availability of quarters and mess.14.  Open mess availability does not directly effect PPD computation except in some OCONUS locations where the locality rate is reduced. Refer to Appendix B, Footnote 2, JFTR.15.  Box lunches are considered a meal in a government mess.  (The issue usually only arises when the all meals available rate is directed or under field conditions). However, according to U4125, “box lunches, in-flight meals and rations furnished by the government on a military aircraft are not considered to be a government mess for per diem computation purposes.”  If the box lunch is consumed in the air, it doesn’t count for per diem purposes.  If the box lunch is consumed on the ground, it counts for per diem purposes.66AFI65-103   5 AUGUST 2005Attachment 3 TEXT OF IC 2001-1IC 2001-1 to AFI 65-103 (Temporary Duty Order)1 FEBRUARY 2001SUMMARY OF REVISIONSThis revision: Modifies the DD Form 1610, Jan 01, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD Personnel (Figure 2.1., Figure 2.3., Figure 2.4., Figure 2.5. and para. 1.2.14.2.).1.2.14.2.
