The Prime RIBS program is designed to: 2.1.1.  Organize, train, and equip Services forces that can deploy quickly to provide food service,lodging, fitness, recreation, laundry, mortuary affairs, NAF resale activities, and protocol in support ofworldwide contingency operations. 2.1.2.  Develop and maintain a highly skilled in-place force of civilians and IMAs to support homestation sustaining requirements as prescribed in Air Force doctrine and the WMP. 2.1.3.  Maintain highly skilled ARC Services forces to augment active duty forces during wartimeoperations and peacetime contingencies. 2.2.  Scope. Whether assigned to deployable Prime RIBS teams, associated UTCs or in-place wartime/contingency duties at CONUS or overseas installations, the Prime RIBS team uses all Services militarypersonnel in AFSCs 34MX, 3MOX1, and specified civilian personnel. All military personnel assigned toServices are postured on a UTC and therefore have a wartime/contingency Services combat support mis-sion. As such, they should not be tasked to perform non-Services contingency duties for functional areasother than Prime RIBS, RED HORSE, air control squadrons, or port mortuary support. 2.2.1.  Wartime duties fall into the following categories: Strategic Mission Support, HomelandDefense, inter-theater deployable, intra-theater deployable, overseas in-place, and CONUS sustain-ment. Except for Strategic Mission Support requirements identified in Services DOC statements,deployment requirements supersede all other staffing needs. 2.2.2.  Services forces are identified on standard Air Force Prime RIBS UTCs. Prime RIBS UTCsbelong in the Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) system under the alphanumericseries LW. Mission capability statements and manpower force element listings for each UTC are con-tained in the Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) of the MEFPAK system. A logisticsdetail (LOGDET) for each UTC is maintained in the Logistics Force Packaging System (LOGFOR). 2.2.3.  Prime RIBS UTCs are fully integrated into the Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) ForceModule (FM) UTC concept. 2.2.3.1.  FMs are a combination of standard, functionally aligned, UTCs, combined to create aspecific capability. AETF FMs also may include smaller force modules that combine standardfunctionally aligned UTCs to create a specific capability; e.g., the Services Learning ResourceCenter (LRC) combines standard functional UTCs from Services, Education and Communica-tions. Primary AETF FMs include: 2.2.3.1.1.  Open-the-Airbase. A small FM designed to open initial capability; e.g., Tanker Air-lift Control Element (TALCE). 2.2.3.1.2.  Command and Control. A small FM with management elements from all majorfunctional areas, such as a Services LWRR3 UTC. 2.2.3.1.3.  Establish-the-Airbase. A large FM responsible to prepare the beddown to receiveweapon systems. This FM brings in Services life-sustaining support for food service, lodging,mortuary affairs, and laundry. AFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 2006172.2.3.1.4.  Generate-the-Mission. Brings the weapon system(s) or primary mission in; e.g.,fighters, tankers. 2.2.3.1.5.  Operate-the-Airbase. Expands initial life-sustaining functions and brings quality oflife functions in such as fitness, recreation, and resale activities. 2.2.3.2.  Services has its own series of FMs sized to support a range of beddown populations fromsmall site support to Wing-sized deployments. 2.2.4.  Active duty Prime RIBS teams must be available for worldwide deployment within 22 hoursafter initial notice. ARC teams must be available for deployment within 28 hours after initial notice.Prime RIBS teams must deploy with team kits as specified in the applicable LOGDET. 2.2.5.  Home station sustaining mission requirements and base recovery actions are met by usingassigned IMAs, civilian personnel, contract expansion, civilian over hires, NAF-T MOA, and aug-menting forces from the ARC, with MAJCOM approval. 2.2.6.  Augmentation requirements of the active duty force may be supported by using ARC personnel(through the MAJCOM MPA man-day program). 2.2.6.1.  Per diem and travel funding is the responsibility of the organization requesting the sup-port. 2.2.7.  Subsistence Concepts. The wartime subsistence policy for each theater of operation isdescribed in WMP I, Annex GG, Appendix 1, and Annex E, Logistics. To rotate WRM stocks, the useof operational rations to support the following may be authorized by the Services Commander/Direc-tor in coordination with the base WRM officer. (Requisition must be submitted for replacement ofWRM stocks utilized as soon as possible.) 2.2.7.1.  During base exercises to include ground support and flight meals for exercise partici-pants. 2.2.7.2.  For field training exercises. 2.2.7.3.  For disaster and humanitarian purposes (e.g., flood, earthquake, major accidents, etc.). 2.2.7.4.  For any deployments that depart the installation in less than 48 hours. 2.2.8.  Deployed Prime RIBS personnel operate NAF resale operations. 2.2.9.  Coordinate use of civilian employees and contracted personnel in business and financial oper-ations in rear area support during regional contingencies, declared national emergencies, base recov-ery, or disaster relief operations, with MAJCOM. 2.2.9.1.  AFI 36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Work Force, governs the deployment of civil-ians. 2.2.9.2.  The Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP) is used to provide MAJCOMsan option for the relief or augmentation of Services forces employed in a noncombatant, forwarddeployed environment. Contracts stipulate that the contractor may provide, as required, the per-sonnel, equipment, materials, services, travel and other means necessary to provide a rapid world-wide planning and deployment capability. Initial response will ordinarily be assigned to militaryforces. As these forces establish a base(s) of operations and if extended activities are likely tooccur, sustainment of operations through contract augmentation is a potential resource option.Additionally, contracts may be considered to fulfill home station contingency requirements. 18AFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 20062.3.  Adaptive Planning. The Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC) is developing AdaptivePlanning to replace crisis action and contingency planning processes with a single, responsive, flexibleplanning and execution process. This single process will yield contingency and crisis action plans. Ser-vices readiness planners assigned to air component commanders are required to develop OPlans and Con-ceptual plans using standard UTCs. Planners use the standardized Services requirements process for inputinto the TPFDD. Planners also create documented annexes to conceptual plans and OPlans. 2.3.1.  The AEFC nominates UTC sourcing to the supporting MAJCOMs. 2.3.2.  MAJCOM Services Readiness FAMs must provide sourcing for Prime RIBS teams to supporttheater OPlans. 2.3.3.  MAJCOMs guide bases on developing deployment, force reception, beddown, and redeploy-ment plans to meet their Prime RIBS mission requirements. 2.3.4.  Crisis Action Planning. Plans executed in support of contingency and humanitarian operationswhere there is no existing deliberate operational plan or conceptual plan (with or without TPFDD). 2.3.4.1.  Component Services planners develop crisis action plan requirements. 2.3.4.2.  The AEFC nominates UTCs to respective MAJCOMs to support Component UTCrequirements. 2.4.  Base Level Planning. An understanding of MAJCOM and component plans is necessary to developbase and unit plans. Services units develop in-garrison expeditionary site plan, disaster preparednessplans, non-combatant evacuation plans, support agreements, and memorandums of understanding andagreement. Base level planning also includes all local plans, checklists, and Services Unit Control Centeroperations. 2.4.1.  Units must develop local checklists or OIs to outline Services actions and procedures to supportbase OPlans and contingency situations. These should include mobility deployments, major accidentresponse, natural disaster response (including emergency sheltering of off-base civilians), terroristattack response, Force Protection Condition changes, Chemical, Biological, Radiation, Nuclear, andHigh Yield Explosive (CBRNE) attacks, reception and beddown of incoming forces, and non-combat-ant evacuation. 2.4.2.  Services Control Center (SCC)/ Unit Control Center (UCC). Units must establish a SCC withthe capability for command and control (C2) of unit resources for response to actual or exercise situa-tions. Control centers must have clear, concise, and complete checklists and status boards for C2 ofthe types of situations listed in paragraph 2.4.1. They should be located in a specifically designatedarea, be ready for immediate operation, have base and local area maps (including current base gridmap), and have adequate communications systems (and back ups). 2.4.3.  Deployed SCC. Squadrons with deployment missions must have checklists, status boards andC2 systems prepared to deploy and operate a SCC at a FOL. Deployable checklists and status boardsshould include beddown planning, all field Services operations and combat support functions, majoraccident response, mortuary/mass casualty, base attack response, and Ability to Survive and Operate(ATSO) actions. The squadron must track status of critical assets, resources, and capabilities toinclude: personnel, facilities, lodging bed spaces (by type and location), vehicles, communicationssystems, and essential equipment and supplies (including cooking and refrigeration equipment,rations, and mortuary supplies). (NOTE: Deployable checklists and status boards should be “opsAFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 200619tested” and fine-tuned during local and MAJCOM exercises and inspections). See Attachment 2, Ser-vices Upward Reporting Data Elements. 2.5.  UTC Posturing.  2.5.1.  Commanders are ultimately responsible for determining home station support requirements.The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) has made it clear that the installation deployment missionhas priority over the home station mission sustainment. MAJCOM Services Readiness FAMs areresponsible for determining their installations’ UTC posture based on AF/ILV Readiness FAM UTCposturing rules in this instruction and Services FAM guidance located on the AEFC Online web site athttps://aefcenter.acc.af.mil/aes/aes.asp. Services UTC posturing rules are maintained on the AirForce Services Agency web site. The Master UTC list should be used to track all military personnelassigned to the Services Squadron/Division. 2.5.2.  All Services funded military authorizations must be postured on UTCs. 2.5.2.1.  MAJCOM Services Readiness FAMs will posture 90%, or more, of their installations’funded military authorizations on standard Prime RIBS deployable UTCs in accordance withparagraphs 2.5.6. and 2.5.7. MAJCOMs will work with their installation Services Commanders/Division Chiefs to implement home station military workload mitigation plans to maximizedeployable capability during surge operations. Mitigation plans should include contractual sup-port, contingency nonappropriated fund instrumentality memorandums of agreement(NAFI-MOAs), civilian over hires, delay of non-essential training and exercises and lastly areduction in facilities and/or service. 2.5.2.2.  The remaining funded military authorizations should be placed onto Associated (A)UTCs. A-UTCs are not deployable as a “team”, but are used to hold personnel that may bedeployed when a member of a deployable UTC is not available. Individuals on an A-UTC will bepostured on a LWZZZ UTC. 2.5.3.  Services units support an AEF two-hit strategy. The AEFC, in coordination with the MAJCOMand Air Staff Services Readiness FAMs, determines which AEFs each Services unit will support.Approximately one-half of the Squadrons’/Divisions’ UTCs are aligned in one AEF and the other halfof the UTCs are aligned against a second AEF. The two AEFs should be the same AEFs the wing istasked to support to keep Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) aligned across the wing to enhancetraining. 2.5.4.  Information on Specialty UTCs and all LWR-series UTCs are available in the Prime RIBSManager’s Guide, Services Master UTC Document. 2.5.5.  UTC Coding. All UTCs must be coded in the UTC Availability System to provide visibility ofthe UTCs available for taskings. Table 2.1. explains UTC codes. 20AFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 2006Table 2.1.  UTC Codes. Code   Description  DWS   Available for deployment during the full spectrum of requirements  Code   Description  AWS   Available for deployment during the full spectrum of requirements; must be postured onto standard UTCs to deploy  DWX   Available to deploy during wartime surge, not normally available for peacetime AEF rotations  AWX   Available during wartime surge, not normally available for peacetime AEF rotations  DXS   Available for AEF rotations during assigned cycle, may be available during contingency surge if the unit’s total tasking has not exceeded the number of “DW*”-coded UTCs  AXS   Available for AEF rotations during assigned cycle, may be available during contingency surge if the unit’s total tasking has not exceeded the number of “DW*”-coded UTCs  DXX  Not authorized for Services UTCs DPS Services standard UTC that is required in-place during contingencies; however, may be used for peacetime AEF rotations DPX Services standard UTC that is required in-place at all times APX AXX  Not authorized for Services UTCs APS Services associate UTC that is required in-place during contingencies; however, the personnel may be used for peacetime AEF rotations on standard UTCs Services associate UTC that is required in-place at all times.  This code is typically used to identify LWZZZ UTCs postured at short tour locations; i.e., Korea and MUNNS NOTE: The total number of “DW*”-coded UTCs postured across all AEF rotations equals the maximumnumber of UTCs that can deploy at one time during wartime surge. The second digit “W” does not applyto a specific UTC record. Any UTC of the same type, without regard to its AEF alignment, and availabil-ity code can deploy as long as the total number of UTCs, of the same type, do not exceed the total numbercoded “DW*”. 2.5.5.1.  Standard UTC coding process. Standard UTC coding is a two-step process. 2.5.5.1.1.  Step one: The UTC coding’s second digit (“W”, “P” or ”X”) determines the maxi-mum number of Services UTCs available to deploy at one time in support of surge operationsand/or war/contingency. Second digit UTC coding assumes all deployable war fighting capa-bility is committed and only sustainment and training directly supporting the conflict will con-tinue. Deployable capability from all AEFs may be required; therefore, the total of “DW*”coded UTCs is the maximum number of military that a unit may have simultaneouslydeployed at one time. Unless a UTC is needed at home station to directly provide or supportwar fighting capability, it should be coded “DW*”. At least 80% of the funded military autho-rizations should be coded “DW” leaving no more than 20% of the military authorizationscoded “DX” or “DP” to support the home-station mission. War fighting commands (PACAF,USAFE) with in-garrison generation missions may exceed the 20% “DX” coded UTCs ruleafter coordination/approval from AF/ILV. The MAJCOM Services Readiness FAM, in coordi-nation with the Services Commander/Division Chief, must determine the minimum number ofAFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 200621military personnel required to support the home-station sustainment mission during surgeoperations based on military workload mitigation plans as discussed in paragraph 2.5.2.1.. Thegoal is to “DW” code all standard Prime RIBS UTCs; however, once contracts andNAF-MOAs are considered, if there are insufficient military members to support thehome-station mission, some UTCs may be coded “X” or “P” in the second character of theUTC code (up to 20% of the funded military authorizations). Capability in associated UTCsshould be used to meet home station requirements before withholding a standard UTC.(NOTE: A Surge operation is defined as a UTC tasking level above what is available at a sus-tainable steady state level across two AEFs. A functional area may be at a surge level of task-ing without a war if there is insufficient depth in the AEF pair coded “D*S”.) 2.5.5.1.2.  Step two: The third character of the UTC availability code (UTC code) is either “S”or “X”. It reflects whether or not the UTC is available for peacetime AEF rotation taskings.(Peacetime AEF rotations do not refer to an operation like Operation Enduring Freedom(OEF) but to a level of support that can be maintained at a sustained level from one AEF rota-tion to the next.) 100% of Services Wing-level UTCs should be assigned an “S” in the thirdcharacter reflecting the UTC may be tasked during its aligned AEF rotation. Above the WingUTCs may be coded “X” in the third character; i.e., DWX for standard deployable UTCs orAWX for Associated UTCs. 2.5.6.  Posture Rules. 2.5.6.1.  At least 90% of funded military authorizations will be postured on D*S coded UTCs. 2.5.6.2.  If possible, no more than 10% of funded military authorizations will be postured onA-UTCs and coded A*S. 2.5.6.3.  The AEF two-hit strategy will not task more than one-half of D*S- and A*S-coded UTCs,or 50%, of the military authorizations at one time. 50% of the military authorizations will be avail-able for home-station sustainment support during normal AEF rotations. 2.5.6.4.  80%, or more, of funded military authorizations will be postured on DW-coded UTCs(i.e., 80% of military authorizations may deploy under worst-case surge operations). 2.5.6.5.  20% of funded military authorizations will be postured on DX* or DP* coded UTCs if theWing’s deployment mitigation plan does not meet expected home station sustainment support lev-els (i.e., the wartime/contingency minimum stay-home requirement--it assumes no AEF rota-tions). 2.5.6.6.  One-half of personnel assigned to A-UTCs will be apportioned to each of the wing’s twoprimary AEFs to provide AEF predictability for UTC alternates. 2.5.6.7.  DP*/AP* coding may be used only for MAJCOM approved in-place units; e.g., MUNNS,Missile Chefs, and overseas short tour locations that could become a contingency location (Osan,Kunsan, etc). DP* coding should not be used to designate CONUS home station sustainmentrequirements. CONUS home station sustainment UTCs should be coded DXS. 2.5.7.  Posturing Priority. UTCs will be postured in the following order: 2.5.7.1.  Lead capability: LWRRA, LWRRB (3 each), LWRR3, and LWRR9. 2.5.7.2.  Follow capability: LWRRB (2 each), LWRR4 or LWRR5. 22AFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 20062.5.7.3.  Once one Lead and one Follow capability are postured, and if sufficient authorizationsexist, posture one additional LWRRA UTC. Repeat Follow capabilities until 90% of funded mili-tary authorizations are postured on D_S coded UTCs. 2.5.7.4.  The remaining 10% of funded military authorizations should be postured on two or moreLWZZZ UTCs, one-half in each of the Wing’s two AEFs. 2.5.7.5.  OCONUS MAJCOMs will posture their in-place requirements using either Services stan-dard UTCs coded DP_ or on LWZZZ coded AP_ and aligned into their respective AEF Enablerlibrary. Example: Short tour locations such as Osan AB, Korea: LWZZZ should reflect the totalfunded military authorizations in the Services squadron, coded APX in AEF Enabler libraryE-ROK. 2.5.8.  UTC Posturing/Coding Example. 2.5.8.1.  Services Squadron/Division military funded authorizations = 85. 2.5.8.2.  Minimum military required to support home-station during contingency operations(increased taskings above “steady state”) = 17. (20% of the funded military authoriza-tions--assumes Food Services contracts and contingency NAF-MOAs used). 2.5.8.3.  Minimum military required to support home-station during steady-state rotations = 42. Figure 2.1.  UTC Posturing Example. AEF-2 AEF-6 LWRRA-9 LWRRB-9 LWRRB-9 LWRRB-9 LWRR3-3 LWRR9-3 LWZZZ-3 DWS (42) 75 DW (88%) DWS (33) AXS (3) 45 10 DX/AX (12%) D/A_S = 100% DXS (5) AXS (2) 40 LWRRB-9 LWRR4-2 LWRRB-9 LWRRB-9 LWRR8-1* LWRR9-3 LWRR2-5 LWZZZ-2 *NOTE: This represents SVS position; consult LWRR8 MISCAP for additional AFSCs’ 2.5.8.4.  94% of the Squadron is postured on deployable UTCs; 6% is postured on A-UTCs. 2.5.8.5.  88% of the squadron is postured on DW_ and/or AW_ UTCs, which represent the maxi-mum number of simultaneously deployable positions. 2.5.8.6.  A-UTCs are balanced between each of two AEFs and hold 6% of the squadron’s authori-zations. 2.5.8.7.  During AEF Normal Operations, approximately 50% of the funded military authoriza-tions may deploy; therefore, approximately 50% of personnel are available to support home sta-tion. AFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 2006232.5.8.8.  During surge operations/war or contingencies (increased taskings)—up to 80% may betasked (all DW_ coded UTCs). (The total number of UTCs deployed during surge cannot exceedthe number of “DW_” postured across all AEF pairs. If the LWRRB UTC coded DXS in AEF 6 isdeployed when a contingency begins that requires the max number of LWRRB UTCs to bedeployed, one of the LWRRB UTCs coded DWS in AEF 2 will not be available to deploy. Only 5LWRRB UTCs are coded “DW” from across both AEFs, therefore no more than 5 can deploysimultaneously.) 2.5.8.9.  Refer to the Prime RIBS Manager’s Guide, Master UTC Document at https://www-r.afsv.af.mil/RD/prime.htm, for UTC posturing examples. 24AFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 2006Chapter 3   EDUCATION AND TRAINING 3.1.  General. All Services military personnel are required to participate in Prime RIBS training, toinclude: Home Station Training (HST), Services Combat Training (SCT), and Specialty Training basedon UTC assignment. Prime RIBS training covers the full range of activities demanded in a contingencyenvironment. Requirements are outlined in the Services Career Field Education and Training Plan(CFETP), the HST/SCT Training Matrix (Table 3.2. and Table 3.3.), and all ancillary training requiredfor deployment and SORTS reporting. 3.1.1.  All Services IMAs will be trained in wartime positions during annual tours and inactive dutytraining periods. 3.1.2.  All Services military personnel must graduate from SCT through the Services Academy(3-level), AFIT SVS101, or a certified SCT site. 3.2.  Home Station Training (HST). Effective HST is critical to provide deployed commanders withfully qualified Prime RIBS team members capable of accomplishing the wide variety of Services’deployed responsibilities. Prime RIBS team members must be trained and ready for deployment to aus-tere, bare base locations with limited or no facilities and transition to sustained operations. HST shouldchallenge Prime RIBS team members to improve their individual and UTC team capabilities for deployedoperations. All Services military personnel assigned at Wing level, will successfully complete HST everyAEF Cycle. 3.2.1.  HST consists of Tier 1 and Tier 2. Tier 1 applies to Lieutenants, 3- and 5-skill level enlisted per-sonnel, and all cross-trainees. Tier 2 applies to 7-skill level and above enlisted personnel and Captainsand above. HST consists of all topics listed in Table 3.2. Home Station Training Requirements. TheHST objectives can be found in the Plan of Instruction (POI) provided on the Air Force ServicesAgency’s web page: https://www.r.afsv.af.mil/ed/Readinesstrain.htm#HST 3.2.2.  HST consists of computer-based training enhancements, self-study guides, classroom educa-tion, hands-on equipment training, duty specific training based on UTC assignment and ancillarytraining such as weapons qualification, Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical warfare defense training,and Self-aid Buddy Care. (NOTE: IMAs will complete initial ancillary training and receive applicableTier level training based on their grade. 3.2.2.1.  HST instructors should attend either the AF Trainers Course or the Classroom Instruc-tor’s Course (CIC). 3.2.2.2.  Services Education and Training manager, along with Prime RIBS manager, will identifytraining resources and coordinate training support for HST. HST instructors must use comprehen-sive lesson plans, training aids, and student handouts to conduct training. HST materials, devel-oped by AFSVA, will be used; however, may be tailored locally to add additional trainingelements. HST must meet criteria published in the lesson plans and objectives by AFSVA. 3.2.2.3.  Services units must equip themselves with authorized HST assets IAW Allowance Stan-dard 429, Part M, Prime RIBS Training Equipment. AFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 2006253.2.3.  The primary wartime job for IMAs, upon mobilization, will be to assume command and controlof essential Services activities at the home station. HST for IMAs will be accomplished on anas-needed basis; however, IMAs will be trained and certified before using any field equipment. 3.2.4.  Attendance at SCT does not replace AEF cycle HST requirements. 3.2.5.  At a minimum, 30 % of personnel postured on LWRRA, LWRRB, and LWRR2, must betrained on specialized vehicles listed in Table 4, SORTS Reportable Training, Vehicle Operations sec-tion. Manual transmission training will also be accomplished if available on installation. 3.2.6.  At a minimum, personnel postured on LWRRA and LWRRB assigned to the 45D1 food ser-vice/ration support FAC should receive phase I quality assurance training. 3.3.  Services Combat Training (SCT). All deployable UTCs at Wing level are required to attend SCT.Associate UTCs assigned to units with deployable UTCs are required to attend SCT as team alternates.Associate UTCs not assigned to units with deployable UTCs are not required to attend SCT (Command-ers/Directors have the option to send their personnel to SCT if desired). The following policy provides theroadmap for complying with the CSAF vision and guidance contained in AFI 10-401. It also providesdirection for implementing SCT course curriculum, and scheduling. UTCs are coded as deployable orrequired to remain in place. UTCs coded as deployable are used to support deployment taskings. DW_coded deployable UTCs show the maximum simultaneous deployment capability of a unit when contin-gency requirements require surge, including “reach forward” into additional AEFs to meet wartime task-ings. Deployable UTCs may be available in any rotation during surge operations. Associate UTCs(typically AWS or AXS-coded) are a holding place for personnel that could be deployable but do not fitinto standard deployable UTCs. 3.3.1.  Deployable UTCs (DWS, DWX, or DXS) LWRRA, LWRRB, LWRR2, LWRR3, LWRR4,LWRR5, LWRR8 and LWRR9, are required to attend SCT and should be scheduled during the 90-180day window prior to their AEF deployment cycle (see Figure 3.1.). During increased contingencytaskings, there may be a need to project SCT training dates prior to the 90-180 day window in antici-pation of AEFC “reaching forward” to task upcoming UTCs prior to their scheduled AEF deploymentwindow based on combatant command deployment requirements. The required training frequency isevery AEF cycle for active duty lead teams (LWRRA, LWRR3 in ACC, AMC, AFSOC, PACAF andUSAFE) and every other AEF cycle for active duty follow on teams and ARC forces. If a UTC cannotbe scheduled for SCT during their scheduled training window, they will coordinate with their MAJ-COM training manager to ensure training is scheduled at the earliest possible time. 3.3.2.  All personnel assigned to Wing level deployable UTCs will attend SCT as a complete UTC/team, if possible. Commanders new to the Services career field must attend SCT within 6 months ofappointment. Individual UTC members are exempt if they have attended training within the last 12months prior to their scheduled training date. (Exceptions to this rule are ARC forces assigned toUTCs who will attend training based on their AEF deployment cycle.) 26AFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 2006Figure 3.1.  Services Combat Training Window. 3.3.3.  Personnel not postured on a deployable UTC, but assigned as an alternate, on an associate UTC(i.e., LWZZZ), will be identified to MAJCOM training managers to be scheduled to attend trainingwith their unit if space is available. If space isn’t available, they will be scheduled to attend SCT dur-ing any available class where there is an opening. Scheduling for personnel on the LWZZZ UTC willbe handled on a case-by-case basis. 3.3.4.  For SORTS measurement, a unit commander may temporarily waive overdue HST and SCT fordeployed personnel, but for no longer than 30 days after they return to home station. 3.3.5.  Unit commanders may request (through their MAJCOM/SV to AF/ILV) SCT credit be given toindividuals who set up and use BEAR WRM assets and deployable Prime RIBS equipment in a realworld contingency/war or exercise deployments (i.e., for beddown operations, not sustainment/steady-state operations). 3.3.6.  Individuals assigned to UTCs postured to support AEF Enabler packages (not assigned to oneof the 10 AEFs) will be scheduled for training on a rotational basis, the same as AEF scheduled UTCs.Individuals are as follows: 3.3.6.1.  Those in a PCS status will be required to attend SCT during their scheduled training win-dow up to 60 days prior to PCS. 3.3.6.2.  Those PCSing from an in place UTC base/assignment to a deployable UTC base/assign-ment will be scheduled for SCT within 120 days of the new assignment. (Exception: If the UTCAFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 200627the individual is assigned to is scheduled to attend SCT within 12 months of the new member’sarrival, then the individual should attend SCT as part of the team). 3.3.7.  Home Station Duty Specific SCT Training. 3.3.7.1.  Deployable UTCs will be scheduled to attend SCT using the “team training” concept.Teams will deploy as an entire UTC and will receive in-depth training in the functional area theyare assigned to on their UTC. 3.3.7.2.  Students will be assessed as a team. Instructors will evaluate using the minimum stan-dards evaluation checklist provided by HQ AFSVA. Each team and/or individual will receiveadditional training when necessary. 3.3.7.3.  MAJCOMs will be responsible for sending the SCT site manager a listing of personnel,by UTC and duty position, NLT 14 days prior to each class start date. 3.4.  HST and SCT Curriculum. Table 3.2. and Table 3.3. itemize the curriculum for HST and SCTbased on current home station duty assignment. Table 3.1.  Home Station Training (HST) Requirements.

See paragraph 2.5. for additional posturing policy. Specialty UTCsattend readiness training relevant to OPlan taskings with the same frequency indicated in paragraphs3.3.1. and 3.3.2., with the exception of Mortuary Affairs dedicated teams (LWRR6, LWRR7, LWRRM,LWRRN — see paragraph 3.5.1.). Specialty team training consists of classroom and hands-on trainingheld at an Air Force centralized school, training site, or at the intended wartime operating location. Recur-ring SCT may be necessary depending on the wartime mission the Prime RIBS UTC is required to exe-cute. MAJCOM Services functional area managers assign specialty team taskings to their respective unitsand gained ARC units. 3.5.1.  Port Mortuary teams. These teams, to include disposition and in-place personnel, attend train-ing at the Dover AFB, DE port mortuary every other AEF cycle. 3.5.1.1.  Port Mortuary personnel who work in a real-world mass fatality incident at a port mortu-ary will receive credit for their training requirement. Copy of orders will be the source documentto reflect participation in a real-world mass fatality incident. 3.5.1.2.  Port Mortuary personnel will complete initial ancillary training, then again as required byMAJCOM or on a just-in-time basis. 3.5.1.3.  Port Mortuary personnel are required to receive the HST Tier 1 to maintain familiarityand currency in Services wartime tasks. 3.5.2.  LWRRH Teams. All LWRRH (command staff augmentation) UTC members must attend theContingency Wartime Planners Course (CWPC), and HST to maintain familiarity and currency inServices wartime tasks. The officer members must attend the AFIT SVS 485, Services Combat Sup-port Course. The enlisted members must attend the Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execu-AFI10-214   27 FEBRUARY 200631tion Segment (DCAPES) course.
