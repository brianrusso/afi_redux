Purpose.  The AF EM capability is employed alone or as part of an AF, Joint, Interagency, or  Coalition  Force,  to  support  Combatant  Commanders  and  AF  objectives.  This  Manual primarily  focuses  on  guidance  and  procedures  for  the  EM  Section  of  the  R&EM  Flight  to manage and execute the installation EM (IEM) program. 1.2.  Structure. 1.2.1.  The  active  duty  R&EM  Flight  (Figure  1.1)  supports  the  Base  Civil  Engineer  (BCE) by managing both the Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF)  program and the EM program. Where manning allows, 3/5-level Airmen should be placed in Operations/Logistics as  responders.  7-level  personnel  should  fill  the  Plans  and  Training  positions.  The Expeditionary  Engineering  Section  should  be  crossed-manned  with  non-3E9  Air  Force Specialty  (AFS)  personnel  from  within  the  Civil  Engineer  (CE)  Squadron  (CES)  as  3E9 personnel  maintain  the  installation  EM  response  capability  within  the  EM  Section.  Some R&EM Flights have reserve Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) positions assigned to the  flight.  Careful,  deliberate  planning  and  forecasting  is  needed  to  utilize  assigned  IMAs properly. Figure 1.1.  Notional Readiness & Emergency Management Flight Structure. Note: AFIMSC Detachment EM Program Managers determine the best structure for the civilianized offices/flights.   1.2.2.  The  Expeditionary  Engineering  Section  sustains  unit  readiness  through  organization, training, and equipping of unit personnel to accomplish contingency operations.  8 AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 1.2.3.  The EM Section supports a cross-functional EM program that integrates preparedness through prevention, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation activities in an all-hazards physical  threat  environment  to  help  commanders  maintain  and  restore  mission  capability. The EM Section has a planning, management, and emergency response component within the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS). 1.2.4.  Reserve flights on active duty installations are postured with one or two full-time Air Reserve  Technicians  (ART)  positions.  The  ARTs  manage  the  requirements  needed  for  the monthly unit training assembly and are responsible for coordination with the host for all host tenant support required according to AFI 10-2501. (T-2). 1.2.4.1.  The flight may also have traditional reservists postured according to the 4FPW-series unit type codes (UTCs) assigned and UTC skill level requirements. 1.2.4.2.  Reserve  personnel's  primary  duty  is  to  train  to  meet  the  mission  capability statement requirements. 1.2.5.  At  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  host  installations  and  stations,  an  EM  Office  is established  under  the  BCE  for  the  home  station  Emergency  Management—program management,  training,  response,  and  evaluation  functions.  The  EM  Office  is  composed  of full-time civilians. 1.3.  EM Missions.  As stated in AFI 10-2501, the primary missions of the AF EM program are to  save  lives;  minimize  the  loss  or  degradation  of  resources;  and  continue,  sustain,  and  restore operational capability in an all-hazards environment at AF installations worldwide. The R&EM Flight  leadership  establishes  processes  to  accomplish  these  missions  by  transforming  the Commander’s  priorities  and  expectations  into  actions  complementing  core  EM  mission  sets. These EM missions are planning, preparedness, and response: 1.3.1.  Effective planning within the EM Section relies on thorough integration of emergency plans  at  all  levels  of  the  organization.  EM  facilitates  the  development  of  the  installation emergency  management  plan  (IEMP)  10-2,  focuses  on  resource  and  risk  management planning, and has situational awareness of all other contingency plans on the installation. 1.3.2.  Department  of  Defense  Instruction  (DODI)  6055.17,  DOD  Installation  Emergency Management  (IEM)  Program,  identifies  the  following  as  preparedness  activities:  risk management;  prevention  planning  establishing  interim  and  long-term  actions  to  reduce and/or  eliminate  identified  hazards  and/or  threats  to  the  installation;  mitigation  planning establishing interim and long-term actions to reduce the impact of hazards and/or threats that cannot  be  eliminated;  training;  exercises;  interagency  coordination;  and  equipping  response forces. Specifically, preparedness activities need to include training and education, exercises, personnel  qualifications,  equipment  certification,  and  the  integration  of  planning  and procedures. 1.3.3.  Response operations involve providing direct support to the Incident Commander (IC) during  natural  events,  human-caused  events  (accidental  and  intentional)  or  technologically caused  events.  EM  operations  primarily  involve  providing  support  in  the  Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Control Center,  CE  Unit  Control  Center  (UCC),  or  on-scene  as  required.  During  CBRN  responses, support,  and  integration  into  the  Incident  Command  System  (ICS)  involves  more  tactical operations such as specialized detection and contamination control support.  AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 9 1.3.4.  The scope of services is divided into two categories to distinguish between the AF EM program  management  and  EM/CBRN  Emergency  Response  Services.  Each  R&EM  Flight prepares to deliver core services and infrequently demanded services that may be provided if resources permit (non-core services). 1.3.4.1.  EM core services are capabilities accomplished in support of the Air Force EM program for the installation commander. The major planning, preparing, and responding services associated with accomplishing these services are defined in Table 1.1 Table 1.1.  Major Core Services Tasks. Planning Preparedness Response Developing the IEMP 10-2 and managing the EM Working Group (EMWG), the Integrated Risk Management Program (IRMP) to include the Risk Management Process (Criticality, Hazard, Capabilities, and Vulnerability Assessments), and Unit EM Program Administration. EM Planning and Management Capability Standards are defined in Attachment 4. EM Education and Training (CBRN Defense Survival Skills, Disaster Response Force (DRF) Training), EM Flight Training, Be Ready Campaign, and Flight Response Equipment Management. EM Preparedness Capability Standards are defined in Attachment 5. Home Station: Managing the EOC, EOC Manager, staffing Emergency Support Function (ESF 5), operating the CBRN Control Center, Support IC, ICS Operation Section Specialized Team (e.g., Task Forces and Strike Teams), and CBRN Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Decontamination (Mounted/Dismounted/CBRN Detection Array). EM Response Capability Standards are defined in Attachment 6. Contingency Operations: EOC Manager, ESF 5, CBRN Control Center (Plume Modeling/CBRN Warning and Reporting/CBRN Command and Control(C2)), CBRN Reconnaissance and Surveillance (Mounted/Dismounted/CBRN Detection Array), CBRN Decontamination Operations. 1.3.4.2.  Non-core services include providing membership  to  the Wing  Inspection Team (WIT),  developing  exercise  input  according  to  Homeland  Security  Exercise  and Evaluation  Program  (HSEEP),  providing  input  to  Memorandums  of  Understanding (MOUs)/Memorandums  of  Agreement  (MOAs)  and  other  base  plans,  conducting Hazardous  Material  (HAZMAT)  decontamination,  providing  recommendations  to Incident  Action  Plans  (IAP),  provide  C2  Vehicle  Operations,  providing  input  into  after action  reports  and  recovery  plans,  collecting  and  observing  weather  data,  and recommending shelter options. 1.3.4.2.1.  Flights may accomplish non-core services if resources permit. 1.3.4.2.2.  Commanders  may  provide  additional  unit-funded  resources  to  enable  the flight  to  accomplish  more  of  these  non-core  services  when  flight  resources  are exhausted.    10 AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 1.3.4.3.  Major assumptions associated with completing core and non-core services are as follows: 1.3.4.3.1.  All response personnel are physically capable of functioning in Individual Protective  Equipment  (IPE)/Personal  Protective  Equipment  (PPE)  for  extended periods in adverse weather conditions. 1.3.4.3.2.  Only one major incident occurs at a time. 1.3.4.3.3.  CBRN hazards include Toxic Industrial Materials, which encompass Toxic Industrial  Chemical,  Toxic  Industrial  Biological,  and  Toxic  Industrial  Radiological materials according to AFI 10-2501. 1.3.4.3.4.  All  EM  personnel  will  coordinate  training  requirements  with  the  Fire Emergency  Services  (FES)  and  utilize  FES  training  criteria  to  complete  annual HAZMAT  Technician  refresher  training  consisting  of  Installation  Explosive  Safety and  HAZMAT  criteria  outlined  according  to  National  Fire  Protection  Association (NFPA)  472,  Standard to  Hazardous Materials/Weapons of Mass Destruction Incidents. (T-0). for  Competence  of  Responders 1.3.4.3.5.  Installations without organic response capabilities have established proper mutual support agreements to satisfy required services. 1.3.4.3.6.  Required response equipment is available and properly maintained. 1.3.4.3.7.  For  specific  concentrated  chlorine  decontamination  solutions  use  Army Technical  Publication  (ATP)  3-11.32,  Multi-Service  Tactics,  Techniques,  and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Passive Defense. 1.3.5.  Emergency Response Capability (ERC) identifies the capability-level using available personnel, equipment, vehicles, and training. The ERC can be affected by the lack of trained and  certified  personnel,  equipment  out-of-service,  and  the  capability  to  meet  established standards.  Note:  Once  developed,  the  ERC  levels  for  personnel,  equipment,  vehicles,  and training  can  be  found  on  the  Automated  Civil  Engineers  System  –  Personnel  Readiness (ACES-PR) SharePoint site. 1.3.5.1.  ERC  is  expressed  as  Full  Level  of  Service  (FLS),  Limited  Level  of  Service (LLS), Critical Level of Service (CLS), and Inadequate Level of Service (ILS). 1.3.5.1.1.  FLS  capability  describes  all  authorized  resources  as  available  for emergency response with appropriate training, certification, and/or appointment. FLS provides sufficient service for quick response and sustained operations. During FLS, all R&EM capabilities will be accomplished when responding to incidents. (T-3) 1.3.5.1.2.  LLS capability is less than FLS, but greater than CLS. Sufficient capability is  provided  for  conducting  core  services;  however  there  is  an  increased  risk  that multiple core capabilities may not be successful when simultaneous accomplishment is  required  (i.e.,  two  core  services,  such  as  completing  EOC  management  and executing  CBRN  Reconnaissance  and  Surveillance  operations,  spanning  multiple operational periods).    AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 11 1.3.5.1.2.1.  LLS may result from unfunded or unfilled manpower authorizations, deployments,  leaves,  vehicle  impairments,  equipment  shortages,  or  other temporary  conditions.  Because  of  these  variable  factors,  the  AF  considers operating at LLS to be a normal day-to-day situation. 1.3.5.1.2.2.  While  in  LLS,  during  an  incident  response,  the  EOC  Director  or  IC allocates  resources  according  to  local  risk  factors  with  the  goal  of  providing  the highest  feasible  level  of  service  during  higher  risk  periods,  while  reducing services  when  the  risk  is  lower.  Thus  during  high-risk  periods  resources  are focused to provide most core services. During the low risk periods, resources are reduced,  resulting  in  cross-staffing  and  multi-tasking  of  emergency  responders, thus diminishing the probability of accomplishing required core services fully. 1.3.5.1.3.  CLS  exists  when  EM  personnel  are  not  available  to  respond  to  an emergency. Upon arrival, the IC determines the appropriate actions to be taken based on their initial evaluation of the situation. Successful outcomes can only be expected when  the  incident  can  be  quickly  mitigated.  When  operating  at  this  level  of  service there  is  an  increased  risk/loss  potential  due  to  limited  resources.  Due  to  exhaustion and  resource  limitations,  CLS  cannot  be  sustained  for  more  than  one  operational period.  Operating  at  the  CLS  level  requires  Unit  Command  coordination  of  a  Risk Management plan using the IRMP. (T-1). 1.3.5.1.4.  ILS exists when core services cannot be accomplished. When operating at ILS, a Risk Management plan is required to be built and coordinated with the BCE, installation commander, and AFIMSC Detachment. (T-2). 1.4.  EM  Section  Responsibilities.  The  EM  Section,  under  the  host  organization  BCE,  is  the single focal point for the EM program on the installation. It is the installation commander’s OPR for  EM  program  execution.  The  section  is  comparable  to  off-base  Office  of  Emergency Management  (OEM)  counterparts.  As  such,  the  installation  Emergency  Manager  assigned according  to  AFI  10-2501  will  ensure  the  execution  of  the  IEM  program  through  the establishment of core EM mission sets. (T-1). A tenant Air Reserve Component (ARC) R&EM Flight  is  responsible  for  requirements  in  this  Manual  specific  to  the  R&EM  Flight.  It  is  not responsible for  IEM program  management requirements. For Joint Base installations where the sister  service  is  responsible  for  the  EM  program,  Air  Force  EM  Sections  are  the  key  EM representative  for  the  senior  AF  authority.  This  position  performs  duties  necessary  to  properly train  and  educate  Airmen  about  AF-specific  requirements  (e.g.,  CBRN  passive  defense  (PD)). The EM Section will: 1.4.1.  Gain  the  greatest  value  from  manpower  and  financial  resources  used  to  execute  the IEM  program.  Ensure  program  responsibilities  are  consistent  with  commander’s  mission priorities. (T-1). 1.4.2.  Analyze and recommend changes in equipment maintenance, training, administrative, tactics,  techniques,  procedures,  and  concepts  of  operation  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of existing capabilities. Up-channel recommended changes to the AFIMSC Detachment. (T-1). 1.4.3.  Meet all training and equipment requirements to respond to incidents using AFIMS as defined  in  AFI  10-2501  and  AFMAN  10-2502,  Air  Force  Incident  Management  System (AFIMS) Standards and Procedures. (T-1).  12 AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 1.5.  Expeditionary  Engineering  Section  Responsibilities.  The  Expeditionary  Engineering Section will: 1.5.1.  Ensure the resources and training required to undertake a unit's wartime mission(s) are consistent  with  tasked  Designed  Operational  Capability  Statement  and  unit  commander's priorities. (T-1). 1.5.2.  Accomplish  program  requirements  in  accordance  with  AFI  10-210  (T-1),  and  Air Force  Pamphlet  (AFPAM)  10-219,  Volume  8,  Prime  Base  Engineer  Emergency  Force (BEEF) Management. 1.6.

AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary (BAS&E) Site Planning, Attachment 13,  CBRN  Defense  Operations  provides  specific  guidance.  As  a  minimum,  consider  the following:  mission  and  threat  assessments,  maps,  host  nation  (HN)  EM  or  CBRN capabilities,  facility  plans,  and  point  of  contact  (POC).  Information  may  also  be  obtained from expeditionary site plans for deployed locations. 2.2.3.  For information not available through the above-mentioned sources, initiate a Request for Information (RFI) to the local intelligence squadron. RFIs should be specific, outline the need for the information and are often classified. 2.2.4.  Access to intelligence information requires access to SIPRNET and proper clearance. All  Active  Duty  EM  personnel  will  have  a  SIPRNET  account  and  maintain  the  account  in accordance  with  local  procedures.  (T-1).  Note:    In  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  R&EM Flights,  EM  Section  leadership  determines  the  necessity  for  a  “Drill  Status”  Guardsman  to maintain an individual SIPRNET account. Section 2B—Security 2.3.  Physical Security Requirements. 2.3.1.  Protecting  information  is  critical  to  mission  accomplishment.  The  R&EM  Flight typically  maintains  classified  or  sensitive  information  necessary  for  the  flight  or  CES  to manage the EM and Prime BEEF programs as well as CBRN defense activities. 2.3.2.  All flight personnel need to be familiar with AFI 16-1404, Air ForceictectInformation Security Program, specifically  as it pertains  to  handling, storing,  generating or transporting classified information. 2.3.3.  Most R&EM Flights maintain classified containers for the unit, and may have to grant access to the safe to unit personnel outside the flight. According to AFI 16-1404, personnel who  have  authorized  possession,  knowledge,  or  control  of  classified  information  grant individuals  access  to  classified  information  when  required  for  mission  essential  needs  and when the individual has the appropriate clearance and a need to know the information.  AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 19 Section 2C—Safety Programs 2.4.  Ground Safety Programs.  R&EM Flights may be required to participate in, and therefore should  be  familiar  with,  the  following  health  and  safety  programs.  Document  training  on  AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, for every flight member, as prescribed by AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction. 2.4.1.  Environmental Management System, Hazardous Communications Program. 2.4.2.  Respiratory  Protection  Program  (as  outlined  in  AFI  48-137,  Respiratory  Protection Program). 2.4.3.  Blood Borne Pathogen Program. 2.4.4.  Laser Safety Program.

Augmentation means using people in other than their assigned Career AFSC duties. After BCEs exhaust their military personnel resource pool, recommend they look within their organization to see if there are skilled and/or trained Department of the Air Force (DAF) civilian members who can perform the duty before seeking assistance from other organizations through the ARB. 2. Consider local needs and conditions when determining augmentation requirements. Augmentation requirements are used primarily to support temporary, short-term workload surges during wartime, contingency, natural disaster, and exercise situations. 3. R&EM Flights using augmentees decide appropriate duties and train the augmentees to perform those duties. The augmented unit tracks all required training. 4. Augmented flights should fund for required training, necessary equipment, uniform items (rain gear, cold weather gear, etc.), and safety gear (steel-toed boots, leather work gloves, reflective belts, etc.). 5. Before DAF civilian employees are used for augmentation duties, all legal, regulatory, and bargaining agreement stipulations are followed closely. 6. Collocated ARC units may be used to fill known augmentee requirements. Close coordination and scheduling with the ARC units is required to ensure availability of personnel and funding to meet the augmentation needs. 7. All 3E9X1 personnel are classified as emergency responders and should not be assigned to any type of augmentee duties conflicting with their emergency response duties. 3.2.9.4.  Establish local logistics requirements, budget, and procure equipment specific to the EMST mission for EMST personnel responding to incidents. 3.2.9.5.  EMST  tasks  for  additional  support  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  CCS, ESF-5,  CBRN  Control  Center,  ICP  operations,  EOC  administration,  and  other  EM support duties.  AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 25 Section 3B—EM Training 3.3.  IEM Training and Education Objectives.

Logistics  Objectives.  This  chapter  provides  the  EM  Logistics  equipment  management information.  The  specific  equipment  inventory  varies  depending  on  the  installation  mission, location,  function,  size,  and  specific  threat.  AFCEC,  MAJCOMS,  and  AFIMSC  Detachments ensure  baseline  and  supplemental  equipment  requirements  and  guidance  are  provided  to  the installation R&EM Flight to support incident response and training. 4.2.  Equipment  Inventory  Process.  Effective  inventory  management  is  key  to  logistics.  For fiscal  responsibility,  efficiency  and  preparedness  in  a  crisis  it  is  important  to  know  what equipment is available, what equipment is needed, and all equipment is in operational condition. A  simple  inventory  management  process  includes  four  basic  steps:  determining  requirements; accounting for equipment on-hand; maintaining the equipment available; and actively addressing the shortfalls and overages. The process is shown in Figure 4.1 Figure 4.1.  Sample Flight Equipment Inventory Management Process. 4.2.1.  Identify Requirements. 4.2.1.1.  Know what equipment is needed to meet the mission. Know what equipment is on the UTCs and how it is used to meet the mission. Identify equipment items needed to support  the  home  station  mission,  including  IEMP  10-2  contingency  operations, classroom  training,  “Be  Ready”  campaign  materials,  installation  CBRN  response equipment,  weapons  and  munitions,  warehouse  equipment,  war  reserve  material, administrative supplies, communications equipment for both office and response use, and exercise support equipment.   AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 31 4.2.1.2.  Review  each  mission  set  listed  throughout  this  Manual  and  determine  the equipment needed to accomplish each activity. 4.2.1.3.  Integrate  logistics  processes  between  the  EM  Section  and  Expeditionary Engineering Section to gain efficiencies and eliminate redundancies. 4.2.2.  Inventory On-Hand Items. 4.2.2.1.  Establish accountability for all UTC and high-value non-UTC assets to include; commercial  off-the-shelf  items,  non-UTC  equipment  valued  over  $1000  and  any  other assets requiring recurring maintenance and sustainment by the R&EM Flight. 4.2.2.2.  R&EM  Flight  will  establish  an  annual  inventory  schedule  to  identify  and properly  manage  shelf  life  items  according  to  DOD  4140-27-M,  Shelf-Life  Item Management  Manual.  This  inventory  is  used  to  forecast  equipment  needs  during  the Program Objective Memorandum process. Document inventory results in ACES-PR. (T-1). 4.2.2.3.  R&EM  Flight  will  conduct  an  inventory  of  all  assigned  flight  response equipment  annually.  This  includes,  but  not  limited  to  PPE  (Self-Contained  Breathing Apparatus,  Level  A  Suits,  testing  systems,  etc.)  and  detection  equipment  (ADM-300s, JCADs, MultiRAEs, HAPSITE-ER, etc.). (T-1). 4.2.3.  Maintain equipment. 4.2.3.1.  Maintain  equipment  and  supplies  according  to  T.O.s,  applicable  guidance,  or AFIMSC  Detachment  guidance.  Determine  equipment  required  for  local  response  and maintain the equipment in an operationally ready status. Ready status is equipment used for response at a moment’s notice. 4.2.3.2.  Label  IPE  maintained  in  the  flight  for  training  use  only  according  to  the applicable equipment T.O. Store “Training Only” equipment separately from operational or dual-purpose equipment. 4.2.3.3.  Identify  items  in  the  inventory  requiring  periodic  inspections  and  calibrations. Establish  a  flight  inspection  and  calibration  program  according  to  T.O.  00-20-14,  Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Program. Stagger equipment calibration dates  so  sufficient  assets  are  available  for  immediate  response;  plan  for  lead  times  and backlogs.  Use  AFTO  Form  244,  Industrial/Support  Equipment  Record  to  maintain records of inspections. 4.2.3.4.  Joint  Deficiency  Reporting  System  (JDRS)  is  a  cross-service  web  enabled automated  tracking  system  designed  to  initiate,  process  and  track  equipment  deficiency reports  from  the  installation  through  the  investigation  process.  If  a  flight  receives  a defective or deficient piece of equipment through the federal acquisition system, log on to www.JDRS.mil and initiate a deficiency report. 4.2.3.5.  Joint  Acquisition  CBRN  Knowledge  System  (JACKS)  is  a  web-based  DOD knowledge management system for information related to the acquisition and support of CBRN  defense  products.  JACKS  provides  detailed  search  capability  to  include  CBRN equipment  specifications  and  standards;  equipment  fact  sheets;  shelf  life  information; advisory messages; new equipment training; and contact information.  32 AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 4.2.3.6.  Review  EM-related  allowance  standards  and  equipment  supply listings (ESLs)regularly  to  determine  if  authorizations  for  accountable  equipment  items  have been  added,  deleted,  or  changed.  The  primary  EM-related  allowance  standards  459  and 016 are located at https://earms2.wpafb.af.mil/sites/asrs/home.asp. 4.2.3.7.  Coordinate with the Operations Element to prepare checklists after equipment is received.  Checklists  should  tell  how,  where,  and  who  uses  the  equipment,  especially CBRN detection, identification, and monitoring equipment. 4.2.3.8.  Update  ACES-PR  to  provide  Resources  Readiness  reportable  and  AEF Reporting Tool reportable equipment statistics to the unit Prime BEEF Program Manager for reporting.  Note:  R&EM  Flight  personnel  must  update ACES-PR regularly to  ensure accurate  and  timely  equipment  status  reporting.  This  update  includes,  but  is  not  limited to, types of equipment, national stock numbers or identification numbers, nomenclature, condition  codes,  expiration  dates,  manufacturer  dates,  shelf  life  dates,  quantities, overages, shortages, etc. (T-1). 4.2.4.  Plan to obtain delta. 4.2.4.1.  Determine the difference between requirements and inventory. The result is the delta,  which  may  be  shortages  or  overages.  Establish  and  maintain  an  R-14  and  R-15 according to local LRS equipment account procedures. 4.2.4.2.  Identify  shortages  to  flight  leadership  for  funding.  Update  shortages  in  ACES-PR. 4.2.4.3.  For  equipment  overages,  contact  AFIMSC  Detachments  for  disposition instructions. Dispose of non-CBRN overages through redistribution to other units, turn-in to LRS or turn-in to Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services. 4.3.  EM Personnel Response Bags.  EM personnel may be required to respond to the scene of a major accident or other incidents with little or no notice. Responding can place EM technicians in  austere environments  with  minimum  time to  transition  from  working in a climate-controlled office to responding outside during inhospitable conditions. Therefore, personnel must maintain a  response  bag  (T-1).  Table  4.1  provides  a  recommended  list  of  items  for  EM  and  EMST personnel.  Further,  develop  the  personnel  response  bag  inventory  (locally)  based  on environments, hazards, and missions. Table 4.1.  Recommended EM Personnel Response Bags. Recommended Items Sunscreen Utility knife Flashlight and extra batteries Insect repellant Individual Hydration Pack/Canteen Bottled Water – 3 day supply Administrative supplies Coveralls Work gloves Dust masks Safety Glasses Sleeping bag and sleeping mat All-Purpose Environmental Clothing System—waterproof jacket and pants or Improved Rain Suit or poncho Mess kit, Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) - 3 day supply (see note below) Note: Common items such as MREs, water, sleeping bags and mats do not have to be  AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 33 maintained at the flight at all times. However, the flight develops a plan to ensure these items can be obtained and issued quickly. The R&EM Flight Chief or Superintendent determines when these items are obtained and issued. Recommended Items 4.4.  Response  Vehicles  and  Trailers.  Perform  and  document  emergency response vehicles/trailers inspections and operations checks according to the unit’s established standards. Table  4.2  outlines  the  minimum  trailer  requirements  for  the  transport  of  the  4F9WM  UTC equipment  package.  Existing  trailers  exceeding  these  requirements  can  be  used  with  an appropriate Prime Mover vehicle until replacements are obtained. Allowance standards 010 (AF Vehicles)  and  012  (Contract  Vehicles)  provide  detailed  information  of  vehicles  authorized  for R&EM Flights.

Planning Objectives, Roles, and Responsibilities. 5.1.1.  Planning  Objectives.  EM  planning  for  the  protection  of  personnel  encompasses  all military,  DOD,  and  HN  civilians,  contractors,  dependents,  and  guests  including  those geographically  separated  units  (GSU)  and  off  base  facilities  supported  by  the  installation. Planning also addresses resources and activities for installation units to prepare for, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards specific to the installation. This includes special events such as air shows, distinguished visitors, and installation ceremonies. 5.1.2.  Roles and Responsibilities: 5.1.2.1.  The BCE typically assigns the R&EM Flight as the CE plans representative. 5.1.2.2.  The EM Planning Element serves as the OPR for CBRN PD and CM planning. Ensure this process involves all installation stakeholders. (T-3). Table 5.1 provides a list, not all-inclusive, of typical installation plans of interest to the EM program: Table 5.1.

Effective Emergency Management Planning. 5.2.1.  An effective planning process achieves the following: 5.2.1.1.  Addresses  all  incidents  probable  to  affect  the  installation,  including  recurring and/or  planned  special  events.  Planning  covers  all  aspects  of  emergency  preparedness, response, recovery and addresses mitigation concerns as well. 5.2.1.2.  Integrates all response agencies and entities into a single seamless system from the  ICP,  through  EOCs  and  UCCs.  Utilize  an  all-hazards  approach  and  be  flexible enough with sufficient flexibility to apply in all emergencies, even unforeseen incidents. 5.2.1.3.  Should be risk-based. 5.2.1.4.  Addresses a public information system. 5.2.1.5.  Determines all personnel requiring training for the job(s) they perform. 5.2.1.6.  Emphasizes communications interoperability and redundancy.  AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 37 5.2.1.7.  Integrates decision points at critical junctions to ensure commander’s intent and priorities are met. 5.2.2.  Emergency  planning  is  not  a  one-time  event;  rather,  a  continual  cycle  of  planning, training,  exercising,  and  revision  takes  place  throughout  the  phases  of  the  emergency management cycle. 5.3.  All-Hazards Approach.  EM planning focus is about an all-hazards approach applicable to the threats at the installation identified through a comprehensive risk assessment. This approach encompasses  terrorist  attacks,  major  disasters,  and  all  other  natural  or  man-made  emergencies, including those defined in DODI 6055.17, warranting action to protect the life, property, health, and  safety  of  military  members,  dependents,  civilians  at  risk,  and  minimize  any  disruptions  of installation  operations.  All-hazards  planning  focus  is  on  developing  capabilities  critical  to preparedness for a full spectrum of emergencies or disasters. 5.3.1.  All-hazards planning includes many actions and processes taken during an emergency and  can  develop  a  generalized  framework  to  respond,  regardless  of  the  situation  (e.g.,  ice storm, hurricane, or resupplying a hospital). 5.3.2.  This  approach  recognizes  all  emergencies  can  cause  similar  problems  and  many response actions to emergencies are generic (e.g., power outages, casualty management, C2). There  is  also  recognition  and  anticipation  that  one  emergency  may  cause  others.  Presently, the  approach  recognizes  many  risks  require  specific  prevention,  response,  and  recovery measures. 5.4.  Emergency Planning Process.  Emergency Managers use the emergency planning process with the IRMP when planning during the preparedness phase. Figure 5.1 depicts the steps in the planning process.  At each step, EM planners consider the impact  of the decisions made during training, exercises, equipment selection, and other requirements. Figure 5.1.  Planning Process.   38 AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 5.4.1.  Step  1.  Form  a  collaborative  planning  team  (e.g.,  EMWG's  AHRPT).  A  team  best performs  operational  planning.  Using  a  team  or  group  approach  helps  organizations  define the role they play during an operation. 5.4.1.1.  Consider  establishing  a  core  team  consisting  of  planners  from  the  following units: 5.4.1.1.1.  First  and  Emergency  Responders  (FES,  SFS,  Medical  Group  to  include Public Health and Bioenvironmental Engineers, and EM, etc.) 5.4.1.1.2.  Civil Engineer (e.g., planners with engineering, environmental, operations, natural resources backgrounds). 5.4.1.1.3.  Force  Support  Squadron  (e.g.,  planners  with  services,  mortuary  affairs, etc., backgrounds). 5.4.1.1.4.  Functional  expertise is  required  during  specific  portions  of  plan development  (e.g.,  Safety,  Communications,  Public  Affairs,  Local  Emergency Planning Committees). 5.4.2.  Step  2.  Understand  the  situation.  Researching  and  analyzing  information  about potential hazards and threats facing the installation brings specificity to the planning process. Understanding  the  situation  includes  identifying  the  threats  and  hazards  and  assessing  risk. The  All-Hazard  Response  Planning  process  in  AFMAN  10-2502  specifically  outlines  the criticality, hazard, vulnerability, and capability assessments. 5.4.3.  Step  3.  Determine  goals  and  objectives  using  information  from  the  hazard  profile developed as part of the IRMP. The planning team considers how the hazard or threat would evolve  on  the  installation  and  what  defines  a  successful  operation.  Starting  with  a  given intensity for the hazard or threat, the team imagines an event’s development from prevention and protection efforts, through initial  warning  (if available) to  its impact  on the installation and  surrounding  jurisdiction  (as  identified  through  analysis)  and  its  generation  of  specific consequences  (e.g.,  collapsed  buildings,  loss  of  critical  services  or  infrastructure,  death, injury, or displacement). 5.4.4.  Step  4.  Develop  the  plan.  Plan  development  includes  developing  and  analyzing courses of actions, identifying resources, and identifying information and intelligence needs. 5.4.4.1.  Developing  and  analyzing  courses  of  action  involves    generating,  comparing, and selecting possible solutions for achieving the goals and objectives identified in Step 3.  The  same  scenarios  used  during  problem  identification  are  used  to  develop  potential courses  of  action.  For  example,  some  courses  of  action  can  be  developed  requiring  a significant  initial  action  (such  as  hardening  a  facility)  or  creation  of  an  on-going procedure  (such  as  checking  identity  cards).  Planners  consider  installation  needs, demands, goals, and objectives to develop several response alternatives. 5.4.4.2.  Identify  Resources.  Once  courses  of  action  are  selected,  the  planning  team identifies resources needed to accomplish tasks. 5.4.5.  Step  5.  Prepare,  review,  and  approve  the  plan.  The  planning  team  develops  a  rough draft of the basic plan, functional or hazard annexes, or other parts of the plan as appropriate. As  the  planning  team  works  through  successive  drafts,  the  members  add  necessary  tables,  AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 39 charts, and other graphics. A final draft is prepared and coordinated to organizations having responsibilities for implementing the plan to obtain their comments. 5.4.5.1.  The following criteria are commonly used to help in the review of the plan: 5.4.5.1.1.  Adequacy—determining if the plan can accomplish the assigned mission. 5.4.5.1.2.  Feasibility—determining  if  the  installation  can  accomplish  the  assigned mission and critical tasks by using available resources within the time contemplated by the plan. 5.4.5.1.3.  Acceptability—determining  if  it  meets  senior  leaders  approval  based  on cost and statutory guidance. 5.4.5.1.4.  Completeness—determining  if  the  plan  incorporates  all  tasks  to  be accomplished and all required capabilities. 5.4.6.  Step  6.  Implement  and  maintain  the  plan.  Exercising  the  plan  and  evaluating  its effectiveness  involves  using  training,  exercises,  and  analyzing  actual  incidents  or  events  to determine  whether  the  goals,  objectives,  decisions,  actions,  and  timing  outlined  in  the  plan led  to  a  successful  response.  After  an  incident  or  event  such  as  those  listed  below,  the planning team reviews and updates the plan: 5.4.6.1.  Natural disaster. 5.4.6.2.  A major accident/incident. 5.4.6.3.  A formal update of planning guidance and standards. 5.4.6.4.  Change in senior leadership. 5.4.6.5.  Major exercises. 5.4.6.6.  Airshow. 5.5.  Unit Implementation Instructions. 5.5.1.  Organizations  may  develop  several  types  of  implementation  instructions  including Operating Instructions, Operating Guides, Standard Operating Procedures, QRCs, etc. 5.5.2.  Implementation  checklists  to  the  IEMP  10-2  must  be  reviewed  and  approved  by  the unit  commander  annually.  (T-0).  They  require  R&EM  Flight  coordination  when  the  IEMP 10-2  is  revised.  Review  implementing  instructions  during  unit  PRs.  Look  for  the  following elements when reviewing the implementing instructions: 5.5.2.1.  Step-by-step instructions for carrying out specific responsibilities. 5.5.2.2.  Resources needed to perform the task. 5.5.2.3.  Standards to which the task is performed. 5.5.2.4.  Information contradicting the IEMP 10-2. 5.6.  Support and Mutual Aid Agreements. 5.6.1.  It  is  essential  the  EM  planning  process  include  a  thorough  understanding  of  the agreements  in  place  at  the  installation.  For  instance,  MOAs  and  MOUs  are  used  to  define areas of broad agreement between two or more parties.  40 AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 5.6.1.1.  MOAs  are  memorandums  defining  general  areas  of  conditional  agreement between two or more parties (e.g., one party agrees to provide support if the other party provides the materials). 5.6.1.2.  MOUs are memorandums defining general areas of understanding between two or more parties. MOUs explain the intended actions of each party; however, these actions are not dependent on the actions of the other party (e.g., does not require reimbursement or other support from receiver). 5.6.2.  Typically, installations have entered into earlier mutual assistance agreements (mutual aid)  with  the  local  community  in  the  areas  of  firefighting,  medical  evacuation  and/or  other areas  as  appropriate.  For  situations  where  the  requested  support  falls  within  the  MAA,  the installation responds based on the agreement. 5.7.

Information  Management  Tasks.  If  the  flight  does  not  have  an  assigned  Information Management specialist, flight leadership assigns tasks as necessary. 6.2.  File  Plan.  Establish  and  maintain  a  flight  file  plan  according  to  AFRIMS—include electronic  files.  Develop  a  vital  records  plan  according  to  AFMAN  33-363.  The  plan  is  a description  of  records  vital  to  continue  operations.  Designate  only  those  record  series  or electronic information systems (or portions of them) most critical to emergency operations. As a minimum,  designate  the  IEMP  10-2  and  EOC  implementation  instructions  as  vital  records  and maintain  a  back-up  copy  on  the  respective  MAJCOM  electronic  file  plan  to  meet  the  off-site storage requirement. 6.3.  Standard  Publications.  Maintain  standard  AF  publications,  such  as  AFIs,  AFMANs, MAJCOM  supplements,  installation  instructions  and  supplements,  related  plans,  and  other publications  according  to  AFI  33-360.  AF  publications  are  available  on  the  AF  Electronic Publishing web site at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. 6.4.  Operating  Guides.  Develop,  maintain,  and  schedule  annual  review  of  EM  operating guides. Table 6.1 lists recommended EM Operating Guides or topics that can be combined into continuity procedures.   Table 6.1.

Social  media  applications  may  be  used  to  disseminate  EM  information  to  the installation general populace. 6.5.2.1.  Before  creating  an  official  social  media  page,  contact  the  installation  public affairs  office  to  determine  all  local  guidance  and  ensure  compliance  with  AFI  35-113, Internal  Information,  Section  15  (Social  Media)  and  AFI  35-107,  Public  Web Communications,  provides  guidance  for  demonstrating  the  need  to  have  a  social  media presence. (T-1). 6.5.2.2.  Information  on  social  media  sites  must  not  be  sensitive  in  nature,  as  all  social media platforms are open to the public. (T-1). Section 6C—Installation  “Be Ready” Awareness Campaign 6.6.  Purpose.  In support of requirements identified in DODI 6055.17 and AFI 10-2501, the AF established  the  AF  "Be  Ready"  Awareness  Campaign.  The  campaign  meets  EM  educational requirements by taking the following actions: 6.6.1.  Providing  emergency  managers  a  standardized  method  to  disseminate  information spanning  major  topic  areas:  basic  planning,  natural  disasters,  man-made  events,  and  after  a disaster. 6.6.2.  Enhancing the emergency manager’s ability to publicize their installation’s emergency management program in a professional and affordable manner. 6.6.3.  Marketing the capabilities of the AF EM program. It is designed to bring customers to the R&EM Flight as the recognized emergency management experts on the installation. 6.7.  Process.  Setting  up  an  effective  installation  “Be  Ready”  awareness  campaign  process requires the following steps: 6.7.1.  Target the hazards identified in the installation's Hazard Assessment.  44 AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 6.7.2.  Determine  what  existing  products  are  available  to  support  the  installation’s  local awareness campaign. 6.7.2.1.  Use the AF  EM “Be Ready” Awareness Campaign Product  Catalog to  identify products. The link to the catalog is available on the AFCEC’s R&EM SharePoint site and provides a consolidated list of products and description of products. 6.7.2.2.  AFCEC/CXR centrally  manages the ordering, funding  and  printing of products and  coordinates  with  the  Government  Printing  Office  (GPO)  as  the  single  product-ordering source.  Using  GPO institutionalizes and standardizes formatting  across the AF and  reduces  overall  cost  per  item  delivered.  AFCEC/CXR  periodically  conducts  a  bulk print ordering period. This allows an installation to order products shown in the catalog. 6.7.3.  Determine  the  type  and  quantity  of  products  needed  to  support  a  local  awareness campaign adequately. Quantities should be based on population, lifespan of the products, and planned need (e.g., training, exercises, and inspections). 6.7.4.  Consider stock and overstock concerns. 6.7.5.  Create  an  execution  plan  for  the  campaign.  Consider  opportunities  to  maximize outreach (e.g., September is National Preparedness Month). When planning the installation's campaign  include  significant  program  messaging  leading  up  to  and  during  the  month  of September. 6.7.5.1.  Use  local  sources  such  as  social  media,  television,  radio,  installation  public websites,  commander's  calls,  newspapers,  and  installation  marquees.    Flights  may  also use the AFCEC/CXR-developed solutions in conjunction with the above. 6.7.5.2.  Continuously  look  for  opportunities  to  market  your  awareness  message  to  the installation  community.  Examples  include  booths  at  the  Exchange  or  Chapel  and interaction with the installation's Public Affairs office. 6.7.6.  Evaluate  the  campaign’s  effectiveness.  For  example,  analyze  trends  by  determining any increases/decreases in the following areas: 6.7.6.1.  Customers approaching the flight to request information. 6.7.6.2.  Calls and e-mails with inquiries. 6.7.6.3.  Visits to the social media and installation’s public websites. 6.7.6.4.  Requests for briefings at commander’s call or other similar functions. 6.7.6.5.  Observations or strengths identified during local exercises. 6.7.7.  R&EM Flights will submit an After Action Report that captures installation initiatives and  accomplishments  in  promoting  National  Preparedness  Month.  (T-1).    Provide  the information  requested  in  Attachment  7  and  submit  to  AF/A4C  through  AFIMSC  for inclusion in the Air Force's annual report to OUSD(P). 6.7.7.1.  AFIMSC  will  review  the  submissions  and  nominate  up  to  seven  bases  to AF/A4C for special recognition by the OUSD(P). Nominations are due to AF/A4C NLT 30 October (concurrent with R&EM Flight questionnaires).  AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 45 Section 6D—Communications 6.8.  Home Station Land Mobile Radio Requirements.  In addition to a dedicated EM net, EM Sections  should  have  access  to  a  minimum  of  the  following  radio  nets:  airfield  control  tower, fire/crash,  CE,  Security  Forces  (SF),  and  Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal  (EOD).  If  the  EM Section does not have a dedicated EM net, work with the Installation Spectrum Manager (ISM). R&EM Flights coordinate Land Mobile Radio requirements with the Communications Squadron to plan radio systems upgrades. 6.8.1.  Contractors must submit frequency requests in direct support of AF contracts through the AF representative (normally the ISM when on an AF base) to the MAJCOM or AFIMSC Detachment responsible for administering the contract. (T-3). 6.8.2.  Under  emergency  conditions,  several  government  agencies  (e.g.,  FEMA  operations) may operate on, or near, frequencies assigned to AF organizations. When this occurs, one of the  involved  agencies  should  coordinate  with  the  affected  AF  organization  to  arrange frequency sharing during the emergency. AF units cooperate fully during emergencies unless frequency sharing would jeopardize mission-essential operations. 6.9.  Secondary  Crash  Network  (SCN).  Requirements  for  the  EM  Section’s  secondary  crash net  are  outlined  in  AFI  13-204  Volume  3,  Airfield  Operations  Procedures  and  Programs  and identify  minimum  requirements  for  agencies  to  be  added  to  the  SCN.  Typically,  the  SCN  is activated only for the situations outlined in AFI 13-204 Volume 3. The EM Section establishes processes when SCN activates. 6.10.  Additional information management and communication resources are available in  Table 6.3 Table 6.3.  Additional Information Management and Communication Resources.

Unit  Level  EM  Program.  Based on the installation's CCIP, ensure each unit assigned or attached to the installation has a practical, realistic EM program that ensures a unit can prepare to respond and recover from various hazards/threats facing the installation. 7.2.  Unit  EM  Program  Scoping  Factors.  Not  every  unit  EM  program  has  the  same requirements.  The  requirements  should  be  tailored  based  on  the  unit’s  mission  and  EM responsibilities.  The  EMWG  should  approve  the  scope  or  depth  of  each  unit  EM  program. Consider factors such as the unit’s size, mission, IEMP 10-2 responsibilities, and UTC taskings. The EM Section may need to adjust scoping at deployed locations. 7.3.  Unit  EM  Program  Tiers.  Consider  dividing  EM  programs  into  two  tiers  as  shown  in Table  7.1  The  purpose  is  to  identify  EM  programs  having  a  more  direct  impact  on  the  DRF. Units meeting the majority of the qualifications listed determine the respective tier. Table 7.1.  Unit EM Program Tiers. Qualifications Primary EM Program Requirements UNIT EM PROGRAMS TIER I - Directly supports the DRF by - Appoint primary and alternate Unit EM providing membership to Representative   -- Crisis Action Team (CAT)   -- EOC   -- First Responders   -- Emergency Responders   -- DRF specialized teams - UCC whose primary role is direct recovery actions with counterparts represented in the EOC - Unit deployment commitments - CBRN Defense Survival Skills   Training - Ensure unit is organized, trained, equipped to respond to emergencies and disasters - Prepare and submit unit EM report - Conduct two semi-annual self-assessments - Receive EM Program Review from R&EM Flight according to the CCIP - Maintain an EM information program - ACES Unit Scheduler TIER II - Indirect DRF support - None, or minimal deployment - Appoint Unit POC - Provide appropriate program orientation requirements - Limited UCC responsibilities (e.g., training to the POC and senior leadership or personnel personnel accountability only) - Receive unit EM Program Review on - Maintain unit supporting checklists to request of unit commander IEMP 10-2 - Participate in exercises when directed - Maintain an EM information program  AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 47 UNIT EM PROGRAMS Notes: 1. The SFS provides a clear example of a Tier I program. SFS directly supports the DRF because it is represented in the EOC and they have First/Emergency Responders; response/recovery teams (e.g., military working dog team); critical unit control center activities; and large mobility commitments 2. A tenant organization (e.g., Army Air Force Exchange Service, Recruiting squadron) located on the installation does not directly support the DRF—needs to ensure personnel can respond to incidents on the installation. This could be one example of a Tier II program or consolidated under the responsibility of a Tier I program such as the Force Support Squadron 7.3.1.  Consolidate  unit  EM  programs  when  it  makes  sense  to  do  so.  For  example,  the Wing  Staff  is  usually  comprised  of  Finance,  Legal,  etc  and,  therefore,  it  may  not  be practical for every wing staff agency to have a separate unit EM program. 7.4.  Unit  EM  Report.  The  Unit  EM  Report  is  a  tool  EM  Sections  can  use  to  manage  the program effectively.  It summarize the status of a unit’s EM program and, with proper signatures, can replace the need for independent appointment letters. Therefore, the data collected should be of significant value and easily justified. 7.4.1.  Collect  Unit  EM  Reports  quarterly.  The  EMWG  can  determine  a  more  stringent frequency. Table 7.2 outlines areas used in a Unit EM Report for Tier 1 units.  Note: ANG and Reserve units may submit reports semi-annually if the EMWG determines a necessity. Table 7.2.

Unit EM Report 7.5.  Unit  Appointment  Letters.  Appointment  letters  serve  as  a  confirmation  of  a  unit commander’s delegation of responsibilities to appropriate personnel. 7.5.1.  When opportunities exist and with appropriate coordination, the Unit EM Report may serve as both the program accountability actions and appointment of personnel. 7.5.2.  When  not  combined  with  the  Unit  EM  Report,  units  should  develop  a  standardized method for ensuring commanders appoint personnel. 7.6.  Unit  EM  Representatives.  R&EM Flight maintains contact with unit EM representatives and emphasizes the responsibility to meet AFI 10-2501 requirements for unit commanders. The flight develops a method for distributing information; tracking and scheduling other EM program related  training;  performing  recurring  EM  Representative  training;  and  coordinating  plans, checklists, or other administrative documents through the units. Members from the EM Section serve as the primary and alternate unit EM representatives for the CES. 7.7.  Unit EM Continuity Plan.  The unit EM program focuses primarily on protecting the lives of  unit  members  and  protecting  unit  resources.  The  R&EM  Flight  ensures  unit  EM  program representatives  are  familiar  with  their  unit’s  mission  and  relationship  to  the  installation  EM program by assisting unit EM representatives in maintaining a unit EM continuity plan. The unit EM  continuity  plan  outlines  the  program  and  identifies  offices  of  primary  responsibilities  for planning,  training,  and  exercises.  It  also  lists  all  supported  units  included  in  the  program.  See Attachment 3, Example Unit EM Continuity Plan. 7.8.  EM Program Documentation.

Purpose.  This chapter provides the guidance and procedures for installation-level Unit EM PRs. It directs a self-assessment for the R&EM Flight and each installation unit. The installation CCIP is a commander’s tool to help units support the AF, MAJCOM, AFIMSC Detachment, and installation programs. 9.2.  Emergency Management Program Review Guidance. 9.2.1.  The objective of the unit EM PR is to enhance the organization’s ability to execute its assigned mission by providing a method to ensure EM programs comply with directives and evaluate/correct problem areas in accordance with the CCIP. 9.2.2.  PRs use CCIP report formats,  requirements for  formal  replies,  routing,  and suspense dates for tracking and correcting deficiencies within established CCIP guidance. 9.2.4.  R&EM Flights must program funding for travel expenses associated with conducting PRs on GSUs. 9.3.  Self-Assessment Communicator (SAC). 9.3.1.  The SAC is used for Unit EM PRs and IG Assessments, and Unit EM representatives use  the  SAC  to  perform  self-assessments  according  to  the  installation’s  CCIP.  The  SAC  is located on the IG MICT website at https://mict.us.af.mil/MyMICTView.aspx. 9.3.1.1.  Highlighting  program  critical  and  non-critical  items  through  the  EMWG provides focus for a unit EM representative’s efforts and increases trend analysis value. 9.3.2.  Unit  EM  representatives  track  open  deficiencies  until  closed.  Units  with  open  items will develop a plan and establish an estimated completion date to resolve the deficiency. (T-3). Section 9B—Self-Assessment 9.4.  Self-Assessment.  The R&EM Flight may have a requirement to conduct a self-assessment of their programs for the unit commander or for the CCIP. 9.4.1.  Coordinate  unit  self-assessment  with  the  appointed  CE  unit  self-assessment  monitor and conduct according to AFI 90-201. 9.4.2.  Elevate deficiencies beyond the capability of the R&EM Flight to the CE commander. Section 9C—Exercise Support and Planning 9.5.  Exercise Support.  The regular evaluation of EM capabilities is vital  regardless of whether the  EM  program  is  part  of  the  installation  exercise  program.  This  includes  coordinating  cross-functional drills with other base agencies.  54 AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 9.5.1.  HSEEP  is  a  capabilities  and  performance  based  exercise  program  providing  a standardized  policy,  methodology,  and  terminology  for  exercise  design,  development, conduct,  evaluation,  and  improvement  planning.  DODI  6055.17  states  the  installation exercise  evaluation  teams  be  staffed  with  SMEs  in  EM  who  are  familiar  with  the  HSEEP, Volume  III.  Although  the  responsibilities  of  the  installation  exercise  program  do  not  align with the R&EM Flight, it is important for essential EM personnel to understand and use key HSEEP aspects. 9.5.2.  EM  personnel  involved  in  exercise  planning  should  attend  an  HSEEP  Training Course.  An  HSEEP  Training  Course  is  an  intermediate-level  training  course  incorporating exercise guidance and best practices from the HSEEP Volumes. 9.6.  Exercise Planning Process.  The R&EM Flight supports the installation CCIP by providing evaluators and training as requested by the WIT. They work with the installation WIT as SMEs in the development of "Executing the Mission" exercises according to AFI 90-201. The CES has a team of exercise evaluators to test and evaluate CE capabilities (e.g., utility repairs, firefighting operations, EM/CBRN R&S). 9.6.1.  The  following  steps  facilitate  developing  and  tracking  unit  exercise  objectives  in accordance with AFI 90-201 and the CCIP. 9.6.1.1.  Step  1  defines  the  capabilities  to  evaluate.  Before  providing  the  installation exercise  objectives  for  scheduled  exercises,  know  the  CE  capabilities  prioritized  for evaluation by the BCE.. In broader terms, one should identify capabilities to evaluate, CE OPRs,  and  the  type  of  exercise  best  suited  to  the  specific  evaluation.  Table  9.1  shows sample exercise capabilities. Table 9.1.  Sample Exercise Capabilities. Step 1–Determine Capabilities To Be Tested Type of Exercise CE OPR Major Accident Natural Disaster Executing the Mission Active CBRN Response Manage EOC Provide Aircraft Rescue Activate/Operate CE UCC Provide Spill Response Emergency Utility Repair CEX CEX CEF CEO CEA CEO  X X X X X  X  X   X X X X X X Terrorist Use of WMD X X      9.6.1.2.  Step  2  identifies  the  critical  tasks  associated  with  each  identified  capability. Knowing what actions need evaluating for each capability keeps focus on the evaluation. If these tasks are not already identified, document the tasks before the evaluation. Table 9.2 shows sample critical exercise tasks.  AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 55 Table 9.2.  Sample Critical Exercise Tasks. Step 2— Identify Critical Tasks Coordinate WMD Response with FES/BE Contingency Response Plan Adequacy Employ EM Emergency Response Vehicle to the scene to support IC Expedient Facility Repairs OPR Task 1 Task 2 Task 3 Task 4 Task 5 CE Exercise Capability Integrate into the IC planning cell CEX Activate CE UCC CEO Make initial contact CEX Establish plan to identify WMD Execute applicable CE tasks Conduct pre-op check Determine entry to identify hazard Perform Resource Management Ensure correct inventory Initiate recovery plan Inform ESF 5     Employ vehicle safely to site Properly setup on-scene Perform Site Assessment CEO Conduct Safety Assessment Isolate damaged utilities Identify Resources   9.6.1.3.  Step  3  tailors  specific,  measurable,  attainable,  realistic,  and  task-oriented (SMART)  objectives  for  each  exercise.  The  objectives  should  identify  the  conditions, actions required, and standards to be met. Table 9.3 shows sample SMART objectives. Table 9.3.  Sample SMART Objectives. Exercise SMART Objective Exercise OPR  Terrorist Use of WMD  CEX CEX CEF   Step 3—Objectives CE Exercise Capability Coordinate WMD Response with FES/BE Employ EM Emergency Response Vehicle to Support IC Firefighting / Rescue Operations   At the request of the IC, integrate into the ICP planning cell to develop an IAP using tenants from the IEMP 10-2 within the operational period Given the activation of the EOC during a contingency/disaster, employ the EM emergency response vehicle at the request of the IC or Operations Superintendent within the operational period At the request of the IC, perform Firefighting and Rescue operations as part of the Operations Section according to applicable NFPA standards, local procedures, and FES checklists within the operational period 56 AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 9.6.1.4.  Step 4 identifies the trends from the objectives. The installation exercise office should  have  an  established  process  to  track  discrepancies.  However,  it  is  important  for unit  exercise  planners  to  have  visibility  on  how  well  CE  met  exercise  objectives. Analyzing  CE  exercise  trends  and  any  changing  conditions  can  be  used  to  determine  if the evaluation needs to be repeated in future exercises. Table 9.4 shows sample exercise trend objectives. Table 9.4.  Trend The Exercise Objectives.

The purpose of this attachment is to assist flights with the development of a comprehensive  capabilities  based  training  plan.  While  this  attachment  standardizes  IHT  across the  career  field,  it  allows  flights  to  customize  training  plans  to  fit  the  specific  needs  and  site requirements of each installation and MAJCOM/AFIMSC Detachment. A2.1.1.  Proficiency training provides an opportunity for all EM personnel, whether they are active  duty,  guard,  reserve,  or  civilian,  to  update  and  maintain  their  technical  and professional  skills.  When  accomplished  correctly,  proficiency  training  provides  returns  on investment  training,  higher  productivity,  better  teamwork,  improved  quality,  increased initiative, enhanced motivation, and an imaginative approach to the job, inspiring innovation and creative problem solving. A2.2.  Research.  The  starting  point  for  an  effective  IHT  program  is  reviewing  publications containing career field training requirements such as the CFETP, AF Form 1098, AFQTPs, and AFI 10-210. Focus the training program on local requirements: mission, local threats, and duty specific  training,  and  acknowledge/identify  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  within  the  R&EM Flight. A2.2.1.  The 3E9X1 CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document identifying the life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum requirements for the 3E9X1 EM specialty. Use these requirements as a starting point to form a robust IHT program. A2.2.2.  AF  Form  1098  identifies  additional  EM  proficiency  task  requirements  for maintaining qualification in the individual’s duty position. 1098s are established by the CFM, AFIMSC  Detachment  EM  Program  Manager,  or  Unit  Level  FAM  and  lays  out  task requirements for maintaining the designated proficiency training. A2.2.3.  AFQTPs  are  instructional  packages,  either  paper  or  web-based,  that  aid  in qualification, in a duty position, program, or on a piece of equipment. AFQTPs can greatly enhance  the  flight’s  IHT  program  by  providing  standardized  training  materials  used throughout the career field. A2.2.4.  AFI 10-210 governs the Prime BEEF program. Within this guidance, 3E9X1 Home Station  Training  requirements  are  identified  by  topic,  frequency,  and  training  source.  This reference is a valuable source to locate the core Prime BEEF wartime/contingency standards Emergency Managers need to focus on. A2.3.  Identify  the Workload. Once training requirements are identified, determine how much time is needed annually to accomplish the training. This depends on the recurring items, concepts needing more time for review, and how much time is needed to perform a practical application. A2.3.1.  Based  on  this,  develop  an  IHT  schedule  to  meet  the  established objectives.  Assign instructors  based  on  flight  personnel  knowledge,  skills,  and  ability.  Coordinate  joint  and cross-functional  training  with  outside  agencies.  Obtain  annual  and  monthly  training schedules  from  the  following  agencies:  FES,  EOD,  BE,  SF,  ARC  units  on  the  installation, and local EM Offices and response agencies. Combining EM proficiency training with these  AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 69 other agencies  can aid  in the development  and validation of cross-functional  checklists and cohesive  response  processes,  which  increases  confidence  and  interoperability.  Table  A2.1 provides  examples  of  combined  training  activities.  Provide  the  final  training  schedule  to EMST  members,  FES,  ARC  EM,  and  BE  personnel  who  may  benefit  from  participating  in the training. Table A2.1.  Example Combined Training Activities. Participate with FES during HAZMAT training/exercises Integrate into EOD/SF Night Vision Goggle classes Sample analysis exercises with BE Participate and use the EM emergency response vehicle during local exercises and/or SF/EOD response exercises During EOD robot operations, provide CBRN detection equipment for suspected CBRN threat and participate in Improvised Explosive Device or HAZMAT response exercises Coordinate with SF and Office of Special Investigations for scene preservation, evidence handling, and chain of custody procedures to  react A2.3.2.  Proficiency  training  enhances  flight  personnel’s  ability  to  perform  wartime  duties. Consider  manning,  mission  needs,  competing  squadron,  and  installation  activities.  Ensure flexibility like  natural  disasters,  exercises, mobilizations, and accidents/incidents. It is time to implement when the schedule is built and approved. The goal is to set aside at least one day each week to focus on IHT schedule items. Use  the  report  located  on  AFCEC’s  R&EM  Flight  SharePoint  site  to  project  IHT  and  have the unit commander sign for approval. to  unforeseen  circumstances A2.4.  Identify Training Sources. Proficiency training may be in-residence, exportable, or OJT. Exercises  and  annual  CE  bivouacs  provide  additional  venues  for  EM  proficiency  training. Valuable training also occurs on a daily basis through everyday interactions with other on or off-base  agencies  and  captures  this  training  in  the  training  records.  Examples  are  staff  meetings, Prime  BEEF  days,  conferences,  exercises,  TDYs,  and  real-world  responses.  IHT,  upgrade training,  and  outside  training  experiences  work  hand-in-hand  in  the  development  of  the knowledge, skills, and abilities of flight members. A2.4.1.  EM  Personnel  will  set  aside  proficiency  training  time  to  effectively  respond  and manage  capabilities  within  the  flight.  Flight  leadership  is  encouraged  to  attend  training  as much as possible or attend on a topic specific basis. (T-1). A2.4.2.  All  EM  personnel  require  a  standardized  common  knowledge  and  skill  set  that  is interoperable  across  the  enterprise.  This  attachment  outlines  the  best  way  to  achieve  those results. A2.5.  Training  Scenarios.  Functional  drills  provide  an  opportunity  to  stay  current  on capabilities and improve proficiency in a risk free environment. Scenarios reinforce and improve the  knowledge,  skills,  and  abilities  reviewed  during  in-house  training.  The  goal  is  to  allow personnel to formulate plans, select and use equipment, manage personnel, and direct operations to respond to a situation before there is an actual need.    70 AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 A2.5.1.  Trainers establish and define training objectives and standards to all flight members before  the  start  of  each  drill.  Each  drill  should  include  demonstration  of  notification procedures,  equipment  selection/load-out,  response,  safety  briefing,  command  and  control, proper use of PPE, research, and after-action and situational reports. A2.5.2.  When  possible,  conduct  drills  with  other  response  agencies.  This  reinforces  roles and  responsibilities  relating  to  combined  efforts,  resources,  and  team  dynamics.  Consider weekends  and  non-duty  hours  for  conducting  joint  training/exercises  as  these  times  are detached  from  flying  operations  or  other  daily  activities  that  limits  participation  from  units such as SFS or FES. A2.5.3.  STS items can be accomplished during specific training events. STS line items can be employed differently and used multiple times depending on the scenario type. A2.6.  IHT  Tool.  To  facilitate  training,  flights  may  use  the  workbook-based  tool  designed  by AFCEC/CXR  to  assist  EM  flights  with  determining,  facilitating,  and  scheduling  training requirements.  The  tool  is  formatted  using  a  series  of  tabbed  spreadsheets  to  include  AF Form1098, Prime BEEF, and additional training requirements. An integrated schedule generator populates requirements and displays upcoming training requirements. This tool is located on the R&EM Flight SharePoint.   AFMAN32-1007  20 APRIL 2016 71 Attachment 3 EXAMPLE UNIT EM CONTINUITY PLAN A3.1.
