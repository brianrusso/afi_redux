This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document  that  identifies  the  legal  scope  of  practice  within  the  Air  Force  medical  Service,  lifecycle education/training  requirements,  training  support  resources,  and  minimum  requirements  for  this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects  of  career  field  training.  The  clear  expectation  is  that  surgical  service  specialty  personnel  be utilized to the full extent of their knowledge/task certification. NOTE:  Civilians/contract personnel occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training. 2.  Initial skills  training requirements  were identified  during the Surgical Services Specialty Training Requirements  Team  (STRT)  meeting  held  28  January  –  1  February  2013  at  Fort  Sam  Houston,  TX and subsequent table-top/teleconference Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) conducted on 6 August 2013.  The decision to  train specific tasks  and knowledge items in the initial  skills  course is based  on  a  review  of  Occupational  Survey  Report  data,  Training  Requirements  Analysis  data,  and 4N1X1 subject-matter expert (SME) input. 3.  The CFETP consists of two parts.  Formal course developers and field supervisors use both parts of  the plan to manage, plan and control training within the career field. 3.1.  Part  I  contains  five  sections  that  provide  information  necessary  for  overall  management  of the  specialty. 3.1.1.  Section A, General Information explains how everyone will use the plan. 3.1.2.  Section B, Career Field Progression and Information identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path. 3.1.3.  Section  C,  Skill  Level  Training  Requirements  associates  each  level  with  specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other). 3.1.4.  Section D, Resource Constraints lists deficiencies in resources needed to accomplish the training mission.  Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities. 3.1.5.  Section E, Transitional Training Guide:  N/A 1             3.2.  Part  II  contains  six  sections.    At  the  unit  level,  supervisors  and  trainers  use  Part  II  to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. 3.2.1.  Section  A,  Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS)  includes  duties,  tasks,  technical references  to  support  training,  Air  Education  and  Training  Command  (AETC)  conducted training, wartime course, core  task, and correspondence course requirements. 3.2.2.  Section  B,  Course  Objective  List  identifies  the  training standards  supervisors  will  use  to determine if airmen satisfy training requirements. 3.2.3.  Section  C,  Support  Materials  identifies  available  support  materials;  an  example  is  a qualification training package (QTP), which may be developed to  support proficiency training.  These  packages are available on the official Air  Force Publications Electronic Master Catalog of Training Documents along with the CFETP (www.e-publishing.af.mil). 3.2.4.  Section D, Training Course Index is a tool that supervisors can use to determine the resources available to support training (both mandatory and optional courses). 3.2.5.  Section  E,  MAJCOM-Unique  Requirements  identifies  requirements  supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. 3.2.6.  Section F,  Documentation  and Training  provides guidance on documentation of training  (medical specific) and enlisted training record.  NOTE:  Reference the most current Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) for specialty descriptions. 4.  Using  guidance  provided  in  the  CFETP  will  ensure  individuals  in  this  specialty  receive effective and  efficient training at the appropriate points in their careers.  This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and  conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.                  2    Abbreviations/Terms Explained  Advanced Training (AT).

Purpose of the CFETP. 1.1.  This  CFETP  provides  information  necessary  for  AFCFM,  MFMs,  commanders,  training managers,  supervisors,  and  trainers  to  plan,  develop,  manage,  and  conduct  an  effective  career field  training  program.    This  plan  outlines  the  training  that  individuals  in  this  AFS  should receive  in  order  to  develop  and  progress  throughout  their  career.    It  identifies  initial  skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.    1.2.  Initial skills training is the AFS-specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force, or upon  retraining into this  specialty,  for award of the 3-skill level.  Normally,  this training is conducted by AETC at the 937th Training Group (937 TRG), Fort Sam Houston, TX.  Initial skills training also refers to the training an individual receives when either entering into an AFSC  sub-specialty  (shred)  training  as  a  non-prior  service  trainee  or  lateral  training  by  a 4N151/71.  Upon successful completion of specialty  course, all 4N1X1 personnel will become 3-levels.   1.3.  Non-prior  service  students  will  be  upgraded  to  5-skill  level  upon  completion  of  CDCs 4N151A  (N)  and  4N151B  (O),  completion  of  required  task  training  and  12  months’  time  in upgrade training.  SrA and  SSgt 4N151s retraining into the  surgical specialties 4N1X1 B/C/D will  be  placed  in  training  status  code  (TSC)  F  for  9  months  and  then  upgraded  to  the  5-skill level.  After award of 5-level, SrA must receive a line number for  promotion to SSgt, be entered into TSC C for 12 months and complete the 4N171 CDC for award of the 7-skill level.   1.4.  SSgt and TSgt 4N171 retraining into the surgical  specialties 4N1X1 B/C/D will be placed in TSC F for 9 months and then awarded the 5-skill level.  After award of 5-level they will be entered  into  TSC  G  for  6  months  for award  of  the 7-skill  level.    Lateral  retraining into  either shred  regardless  of  rank  and  skill  level  will  result  in  a  24-month  Specialty  Knowledge  Test (SKT) exemption.   1.5.  Upgrade  training  identifies  the  mandatory  courses  (resident  and  correspondence),  and task qualification  requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is  actual  hands-on  task  performance  training  designed  to  qualify an  airman  in  a  specific  duty position.  This training  occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to  provide  the  performance  skills/knowledge  required  to  do  the  job.    Advanced  training  is formal specialty  training used for selected Airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either  in-residence  or  exportable  advanced  training  courses,  or  OJT,  provided  to  personnel  to increase  their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.   1.6.  The CFETP has several  purposes: 1.6.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.    Also,  it  is  used  to  help  supervisors  identify  training  at  the  appropriate  point  in  an individual's career. 1.6.2.  Identifies  task  and  knowledge  training  requirements  and  generally  describes  "scope  of practice" in the Surgical Service Specialty, and recommends training/education throughout each phase of an individual's career. 7   1.6.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method employed.   1.6.4.  Identifies  major  resource  constraints  which  impact  full  implementation  of  the desired career field training process.   2.  Use of the CFETP.         2.1.  The  CFETP  will  be  used  by  the  AFCFM,  MFMs  and  supervisors  at  all  levels  to  ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty. 2.2.  AETC  training  personnel  will  develop/revise  formal  resident,  non-resident,  field  and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the  CFETP.    They  will  also  work  with  the  AFCFM  to  develop  acquisition  strategies  for obtaining  resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.3.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the mandatory initial,  upgrade, and proficiency  requirements  outlined  in  the  CFETP.    Identified  requirements  can  be  satisfied  by OJT,  resident training,  non-resident  (exportable)  training,  contract  training,  or  read-ahead modules.  MAJCOM-developed  training  to  support  this  AFSC  must  be  identified  for  inclusion into this plan. 2.4.  QTPs are developed by the AFCFM, IAW AFI 36-2201. 2.5.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 2.6.  Coordination  and  Approval  of  the  CFETP.    The  AFCFM  is  the  approval  authority.  MAJCOM representatives and  AETC training  personnel will identify needs and  coordinate on the  career  field  training  requirements.    The  AETC  training  manager  for  this  specialty  will initiate  an  annual  review  of  this  document  by  AETC  and  MFMs  to  ensure  currency  and accuracy.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate  duplicate training.                  8             Section B - Career Progression and Information 1.  Specialty Description. 1.1.

Skill and Career Progression. 2.1.1. Career Field Path.  Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent  skill  level  play  an  important  role  in  the  Air  Force's  ability  to  accomplish  its mission.  It is essential that  everyone involved in training do his/her part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective  training program IAW AFI 36-2201.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure  each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in his/her career.    The  following  narrative  and  the  AFSC  4N1X1  career  field  flow  charts  identify  the training career path, and defines the training required in an individual's career.  2.2.    Apprentice  (3)  Level.    Upon  completion  of  initial  skills  training,  a  trainee  will  work with  a  trainer  to  enhance  knowledge  and  skills.    He/she  will  enroll  in  and  complete  the CDCs,  and  initiate  task  qualification  training in  STS  core  tasks  and  all  STS  tasks  assigned for the duty position.  Once task certified, a trainee may perform the task unsupervised. 2.3.    Journeyman  (5)  Level.    Once  upgraded  to  the  5-skill  level,  journeymen  will  enter  into continuation  training  to  broaden  their  experience  base.    Individuals  will  attend  the  Airman Leadership School (ALS) at the appropriate point of their enlistment.  Five-skill levels may be considered for appointment as  training certifiers after promotion to SSgt.  Also after award of the 5-skill level, first-term airmen in their CAREERS window, and career airmen, may apply for lateral  retraining  into  one  of  the  surgical  sub-specialties  [Urology  (4N1X1B),  Orthopedics (4N1X1C), or Otolaryngology (4N1X1D)].  Five-level individuals may be assigned in various positions  in  Anesthesia,  Surgery,  SPD,  Supply,  surgical  specialty  clinics,  and  other  areas relating  to  Surgical  Services.  They  are  also  encouraged  to  start  working  on  their  continuing education toward a CCAF degree in Surgical Services Technology.  2.3.1.  EXCEPTION TO POLICY: 2.3.1.1.  First-term Airmen 4N151 may apply for lateral retraining prior to  their normal window if they have served a minimum of 24 months of their enlistment for entry into the 4N1X1B, 4N1X1C, and 4N1X1D shreds of their AFSC only. 12        2.3.1.2.    If  a  member  is  stationed  overseas  they  must  have  a  date  eligible  for  return  from overseas  (DEROS)  or  be  willing  to  extend  DEROS  out  to  12  months  after  the  class graduation date or member has an indefinite DEROS  and will serve 12 months after course graduation.  2.3.1.3.  AFSC shreds are considered proficient in the basic AFSC, and may be used in either the shred or basic AFSC.  Example:  An individual’s primary AFSC is 4N151D.  Because this AFSC is authorized to be used within the shred, the individual is considered qualified to work in  either  AFSC  4N151  or  4N151D.    However,  while  a  4N151  may  temporarily  work  in  a specialty  clinic  the  individual  will  not  be  awarded  a  shred  until  all  formal  course/training requirements for the award of the shred is completed.  2.3.2.  4N131B/C/D.    Upon  selection  for  lateral  retraining,  the  trainee  will  attend  the  in-residence  course. Upon completion of initial skills training, a trainee will work with a trainer to enhance  knowledge and skills.  The trainer will initiate task qualification training in STS core tasks  and  all  STS  tasks  assigned  for  the  duty  position.    Once  task  certified,  a  trainee  may perform  the  task  unsupervised.    Five-skill-level  journeymen  will  also  enter  into  continuation training to broaden their  experience base.  Those holding the 5-skill level may be assigned in various positions in their specialty and related  areas. 2.4.  Craftsman  (7)  Level.  A  craftsman  can  expect  to  fill  positions  such  as  various Noncommissioned  Officer  In  Charge  (NCOIC)  staff  positions  in  Surgical  Services,  SPD, clinics, and any other requirement  specified in the AFECD.  Continuation training is available and  should  be used  based  on the  individual's  particular  training needs.  Those  holding  the  7-skill  level  should  take  courses  to  obtain  added  knowledge  on  management  of  resources  and personnel. To assume the rank of MSgt, individuals must be graduates of the Noncommissioned Officer Academy (NCOA).  Continued academic education is encouraged.  2.5.    Superintendent  (9)  Level.    A superintendent  can  expect  to  fill  various  supervisory and management  positions.  Additional training in  the  areas  of  budget,  manpower,  resources,  and personnel  management  should  be  pursued  though  continuing  education.  Additional  higher education and completion of courses outside of the career AFSC are also recommended.  2.6.  Air Force Career Field Manager (Medical).  Per AFI 44-104, the CFM serves as enlisted consultant to the Air Force Surgeon General for all AFSC-related matters.  In addition, enlisted CFMs  have  primary  responsibilities  as  defined  in  AFI  36-2201,  AFI  36-2101,  Classifying Military  Personnel  (Officers  and  Enlisted),  and  the  AFECD,  AFI  36-2640,  Total  Force Development, and AFI 41-106.      3.  Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to  encompass  the  entire  spectrum  of  training  requirements  for  the  4N1X1X  career  field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy  must  be  apparent  and  affordable  to  reduce  duplication  of  training  and  eliminate  a disjointed approach to training.  Decisions were made as to the content of the CFETP during the Surgical  Service  STRT  held  28  January  –  1  February  2013  at  Fort  Sam  Houston,  TX  and  the table-top U&TW conducted on 6 August 2013. 3.1.  Initial Skills Training.   Initial skills course content (3-skill level) will be revised to provide training needed to prepare graduates for Surgical Service Specialty positions.  13    3.2.  Upgrade Training.  The current CDC used for journeyman  and craftsman training will be revised.  3.3.  STS Changes.  Core tasks and other requirements for 5- and 7-skill levels were established.   4.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).   4.1.  Enrollment.

This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC resident classes beginning August 2015. 2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Attachment 4, Air Force Training Program Career Field Education and Training, this STS: 2.1.  Lists in column 1 of attachments 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are the most common tasks knowledge and technical references (TRs) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill levels. TRs  in  the  source  summary  are  commercial  publications  or  other  service  publications  that  are essential  for  OJT  and  mission  accomplishment  and  are  referenced  by  title  throughout  the  STS.  The  unit  OJT  section  will  consolidate  the  requirements  for  the  unit  they  support  and  order publications through the medical group/clinic library activity. 2.2.  Uses the numbers 5  or  7 in  column 2 of  attachments 2, 3, 5, 7  and 9,  to  identify core tasks required  for  upgrade  to  the  5-and  7-skill  levels  respectively  in  the  surgical  service  apprentice specialty.    Personnel  must  be  trained  on  appropriate  core  and  duty  tasks  to  complete  upgrade training.  Not  all  tasks  require  third  party  certification.    The  symbol  “^”  in  column  2 identifies critical tasks.  These are the only tasks that require third party certification. 2.3.  Certification.  Column 3 of attachments 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9, is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge t raining requirements.  Use automated training management systems, if available, to document technician qualifications.  Task certification must show a certification or completion date.  NOTE:  Trainers must (1) possess a 4N1XX AFSC or DoD equivalent; (2) be qualified on the tasks they will train; (3) be recommended by their supervisor; and (4) have completed the Air Force  Training Course  (AFTC).    Certifiers  must  (1)  be  at  least  a  SSgt  or  civilian  equivalent;  (2) possess  a  minimum  of  5-skill  level;  (3)  have  completed  the  AFTC;  and  (4)  be  trained  and/or certified  on  tasks  they  will  certify.    The  certification  official  must  be  someone  other  than  the trainer.    Licensed/credentialed  healthcare  providers  may  substitute  as  trainers  and/or  certifiers without attending the AFTC.   If the trainer is a licensed/credentialed provider, they may serve as both the trainer and certifier. 2.4.  Column 4 of attachments 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9, shows formal training, correspondence course and QTP requirements.  It also shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the trainee as a result of training on the task and career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.  For a list of QTP volume numbers and titles, refer to Section C.  NOTE:  Training codes in columns 4B and  4C  reflected  for  5  and  7-skill  levels  indicate  the  information  provided  in  the  CDCs.  These codes are not intended to reflect the level required to satisfy OJT upgrade requirements.  2.5.  Contains  qualitative  requirements.  Attachment  1  contains  the  proficiency  code  key  used  to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by the resident training courses. 2.6.  Is used to document tasks when placed in the Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  Refer to  AFI  36-2201  for  further  guidance  on  documentation,  transcribing,  certification, decertification, and recertification. 2.7.  Is used as a performance standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the “Go” level. “Go” means  the  individual  can  perform  the  task  without  assistance  and  meets  local  demands  for 26                      accuracy,  timeliness,  and  correct  use  of  procedures  (“Go”  level  equates  to  “3c”  in  the  STS proficiency code key). 2.8.  Is  a  guide  for  development  of  promotion  tests  used  in  the  Weighted  Airman  Promotion System (WAPS).  SKT is developed at the AETC Occupational Analysis Division, by SNCOs with extensive practical experience  in their  career field.  The test samples  knowledge  of STS  subject-matter  areas  judged  by  test  development  team  members  as  most  appropriate  for  promotion  to higher  grades.  Questions  are  based  upon  study  references  listed  in  the  Enlisted  Promotion References and Requirements Catalog.  WAPS is not applicable to the ANG or ARC. 3.  Recommendations. 3.1.

Upon  completion  of  Surgical  Service  Apprentice  Course  –  Phase  I  and  Surgical  Service Apprentice - Phase II, all Surgical Service Apprentices will be assigned to an active duty hospital  for a  period  of  60  days  to  acquire  proficiency  in  performing  tasks  for  their  skill  level.    Qualification training  must  be  accomplished  in  conjunction  with  Phase  II  training.    The  apprentice  should  be assigned  to  a  surgical  suite  and  SPD.    Active  duty  personnel  should  ensure  that  appropriate experiences and supervision are provided to assist the apprentice  in gaining the desired confidence and proficiency on all core tasks for the specialty.  2.2.1.2.    To  ensure  continuity  between  resident  and  clinical  training,  the  apprentice  will  forward  a copy  of  his/her  technical  school  certificate,  AF  Form  1256,  to  the  Guard  unit  of  assignment.  The Guard unit of assignment will then initiate upgrade action using AF Form 2096 to award the  3-skill level and enter the apprentice in the appropriate TSC “B” or “F”.  OPR:  ANGRC/SGN, 3500 Fetchet Ave., Andrews AFB, MD 20331-5157, DSN: 278-8303.  3.  ARC RSV (Sustainment Training).  Personnel in the 3-skill level must complete all core tasks identified  in  the  STS  prior  to  5-  level  upgrade.    QTPs  have  been  developed  to  standardize  and correspond with the RSVs.  RSVs  can be accomplished at active duty MTFs, Expeditionary Medical Support  (commonly  referred  to  as  EMEDs)  and  the  Center  for  the  Sustainment  of  Trauma  and Readiness Skills (commonly referred to as CSTARS).  Section F – Documentation of Training (Medical Specific)    Part 1:  AFTR  1.    AFTR  Purpose.  An  enterprise-wide  custom  training  management  system  designed  to  replace the paper-based training records  (previously called the Enlisted Training and Competency  Folder).  It has been mandated for use by all enlisted career fields within the AFMS to document all training actions and competency-related issues.  2.  AFTR components managed by the supervisor are:  2.1.    Master  Task  List  (MTL).    The  MTL  is  a  comprehensive  list  containing  100%  of  all  tasks performed within a work center.  The MTL consists of the current STS, AF Form 623 Parts  II and III, AF Forms 797 and 1098 tasks, and tasks required to meet deployment and/or UTC  requirements.  2.2.  Master Training Plan (MTP).  The MTP employs a strategy for ensuring the completion of  all work center job requirements by using an MTL and serves as a guide for supervisors, trainers,  and certifiers  to  ensure  that  personnel  are trained  in  an  effective  and  efficient  manner to  meet  training and  mission  requirements.    The  MTP  will  include  when  tasks  on  the  MTL  should  be  trained (priority/milestones),  how  they  will  be  trained  (resources/method),  and  approximately  how  long  it should  take  to  train  on  individual  tasks  or  set  of  tasks.    Refer  to  AFI  36-2201  for  guidance  in developing the MTP.    56    2.3.    Duty  Task  List  (DTL).    The  DTL  is  a  list  of  all  tasks  required  for  a  given  duty  position.       The  supervisor creates the DTL by selecting tasks from the MTL.  2.4.  Individual Training Record (ITR).  All training is documented in the ITR by way of AFTR. This is the electronic version of the former Enlisted Training and Competency Folder.  The ITR is made up  of  the  AF  Form  623  Parts  I,  II and  III;  AF  Forms  623a,  797, 803  and  1098;  and  JQS.  This record is automatically populated based upon the duty  position the individual is assigned to. All enlisted personnel (CMSgt and below) with a medical  AFSC will have an active ITR within AFTR.    Refer  to  AFI  36-2201  for  guidance  in  documenting  training  on  the  various  forms contained within the ITR.  2.5.  QTPs required to perform peacetime/wartime duties.  2.5.1.  Required for all tasks identified in the CFETP that requires completion of a QTP before upgrade.  2.5.2.    Required  for  all  tasks  not  listed  in  the  CFETP  and/or  identified  by  the  duty  section  or facility as a high-risk procedure or task.  NOTE:  Tasks included in the CFETP have already been reviewed.  Those identified as high risk usually have a QTP.  Other tasks in the CFETP  do not require QTPs.  NOTE:  The 4N1X1X AFCFM serves as the initial point of contact for QTP development, and  may delegate this responsibility to the MFM.  3.  AFTR provides the capability to upload training-related documents into an ITR.  The  following documents (as applicable) will be uploaded into every 4N1X1X ITR:  3.1.   Current BLS Card.  3.2.   AF Form 2096.  3.3.   AETC Form 156, Student Training Report (Remove IAW AFI 36-2201).  3.4.   CDC Enrollment Cards (Remove IAW AFI  36-2201).  3.5.   AF Form 34, Field Score Sheet (Remove IAW AFI 36-2201).  3.6.  Course Examination Scorecard (Remove IAW AFI 36-2201).  4.  Guidance for AFMS-required ITR documentation also includes, but is not limited to, AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program Management, AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management; AFI 44-110, Medical Quality Operations; and AFI 46-101, Nursing Services and Operations.  57      Job description/performance standards for each work center duty position. Part 2:  Work Center Training Binder  5.  Initial  (work  center  orientation/supervisor  initial  evaluation)  and  ongoing  (competency verification) training is vital to the successful mission of any organization.  To ensure all initial and  ongoing  work  center  training  meets  required  standards,  each  work  center  will  maintain  a training binder (electronic or hard copy).  This training binder will be utilized by supervisors and trainers and will be set up in the following order:  5.1.  Work center description.  This includes daily work center mission, responsibilities, and any age-range of patients cared for in this work center.  5.2.   Work  center training monitor  appointment  letter  identifying primary,  alternate,  and  the individual’s  roles and responsibilities.  5.3.  Roster identifying work center trainer(s)/certifier(s).  5.4.  5.5.    Current  CFETP  and  associated  change(s)  as  found  on  Air  Force  E-Publishing  for  each AFSC  assigned  to  the  work  center.    NOTE:    It  may  be  helpful  to  create/maintain  a  training binder  for each AFSC.  5.6.  Copy of the MTP, as found in AFTR, for each work center.  This will include the STS, 797s, 1098s, 623 II, and 623 III.  5.7.  Copies of all QTPs and/or ISD checklist(s) used during orientation and/or location(s) of any training plans/evaluation tools used to validate trainee qualifications.  5.8.  Work center orientation checklist. In addition to the minimum requirements stated in AFI 36-2201, include timelines (milestones) for each task identified.  5.9.  AF  Form  623a  sample  entry  of  supervisor  initial  evaluation  of  trainee  qualifications. Minimum information required in the statement can be found in AFI 36-2201.  This evaluation must  also  include  full  review  of  the  MTP  for  trainee’s  duty  position,  revalidation  of qualification(s)  and  timelines  (milestones)  for  items  that  require  further  validation  and/or training.  5.10.  AF Form 623a sample entry of annual job description/performance standards review.              58
