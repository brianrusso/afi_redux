General.  This  Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  provides  flight  examiners  and  aircrews  with procedures and evaluation criteria/tolerances to be used during flight evaluations as specified in AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.  Specific areas for evaluation are prescribed  to  ensure  an  accurate  assessment  of  the  proficiency  and  capabilities  of  aircrews.  Evaluators  use  this  AFI  when  conducting  aircrew  evaluations.    Instructors  use  this  AFI  when preparing aircrews for qualification. 1.2.  Applicability.  This AFI is applicable to all individuals operating KC-135 aircraft.  Copies should be available to all aircrew members. 1.3.  Key Words and Definitions. 1.3.1.  “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.3.2.  “Should” accomplishment. is  used to indicate  a  preferred,  but  not  mandatory,  method  of 1.3.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.4.  “Note” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential to emphasize. 1.4.  Deviations  and  Waivers.  Directive  guidance  (will,  shall,  must,  etc.)  throughout  this regulation  are tiered  IAW AFI 33-360, Publications  and Forms Management. For examples of tiered  waivers,  see  AFI  33-360.  Director,  MAJCOM/A3  is  waiver  authority  for  MAJCOM supplements  to  this  instruction.    MAJCOM/A3s  will  forward  a  copy  of  approved  long-term waivers, to  this instruction, to  HQ AMC/A3VK for follow-on action.  Do not  deviate from  the policies  and  guidance  in  this  AFI,  except  for  safety  or  when  necessary  to  protect  the  crew  or aircraft  from  a  situation  not  covered  by  this  AFI  and  immediate  action  is  required.    Report deviations or exceptions without waiver through channels to MAJCOM Stan/Eval function who in turn, notifies HQ AMC/A3V for follow-on action, if necessary. 1.4.1.  Waiver  Process.  Coordination  through  HQ  AFFSA/XOF  (hqaffsa.xof@us.af.mil)  is required for the initiation of Tier 0 and 1 waivers and is recommended prior to initiation of Tier 2 and 3 waivers. HQ AFFSA/XOF will provide only written waivers; verbal waivers are not authorized. 1.4.1.1.  Tier 0:  Annotated by “(T-0)”. Determined by respective non-AF authority (e.g. Congress, White House, Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, etc.). The waiver authority is external to AF. 1.4.1.1.1.  HQ AFFSA/XOF will be contacted to initiate Tier 0 waivers. Following a MAJCOM/CC  (delegable  no  lower  than  MAJCOM/A3)  request,  HQ  AFFSA/XOF will  request  AFI  Certifying  Official  approval  for  a  Tier  0  waiver  after  concurrence from  the  external  agency  (i.e.  an  Exemption  to  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations (CFRs) granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator). Tier 0 waiver renewal requests will only be accepted from MAJCOM Stan/Eval. 6 AFI11-2KC-135V2  4 AUGUST 2017 1.4.1.1.2.  Tier  0  guidance  may  include  FAA  guidance  from  the  CFRs  or  guidance from the ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices. 1.4.1.2.  Tier 1: Annotated by “(T-1)”. Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders or the USAF  strongly  at  risk  of  mission  or  program  failure,  death,  injury,  legal  jeopardy  or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. 1.4.1.2.1.  HQ  AFFSA/XOF  will  initiate  Tier  1  waivers.  Following  a  MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower than MAJCOM/A3) request, HQ AFFSA/XOF will request AFI Certifying Official concurrence. Tier 1 waiver renewal requests will only be accepted from MAJCOM Stan/Eval. 1.4.1.2.2.  Tier  1  includes  guidance  that  lends  to  standardization  across  all  USAF wings and platforms. 1.4.1.3.  Tier 2: Annotated by “(T-2)”. Non-compliance may degrade mission or program effectiveness  or  efficiency  and  has  potential  to  create  moderate  risk  of  mission  or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste, or abuse. 1.4.1.3.1.  MAJCOM  Stan/Eval  will  initiate  Tier  2  waivers  and  will  request MAJCOM/CC  (delegable  no  lower  than  MAJCOM/A3)  approval  for  all  Tier  2 waivers. Tier 2 waivers only apply within the approving MAJCOM. 1.4.1.3.2.  Tier  2  guidance  includes  instruction  that  lends  to  standardization  across MAJCOM-specific  wings  and  platforms.  Once  approved,  MAJCOM  Stan/Eval  will send an informational copy to HQ AFFSA/XOF within 5 duty days. 1.4.1.4.  Tier  3:  Annotated  by  “(T-3)”.  Non-compliance  may  limit  mission  or  program effectiveness or efficiency and has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste, or abuse. 1.4.1.4.1.  Wing commanders, delegable no lower than operations group commanders or equivalent, will initiate and approve Tier 3 waiver requests. Once approved, wings will send an informational copy to MAJCOM Stan/Eval and HQ AFFSA/XOF within 5 duty days. 1.4.1.4.2.  Tier  3  guidance  includes  instruction  that  is  limited  to  wing-  and  location specified rules that do not affect AF-level standardization. 1.4.2.  For  the  purposes  of  this  instruction,  flying  MAJCOMS  are:  ACC,  AETC,  AFDW, AFGSC, AFMC, AFRC, AFSOC, AMC, DIA, NGB, PACAF, and USAFE. Commander Air Force  forces  (COMAFFORs)  in  the  grade  of  O-8  or  higher  in  Combatant  Commands (CCMDs)  are  considered  MAJCOM  commanders  only  for  forces  under  their  operational control. 1.5.  Supplements.  This  AFI  is  a  basic  directive.    Each  user  MAJCOM  may  supplement  this AFI according to AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Procedures.  MAJCOMs may specify unique evaluation items in their appropriate supplement.  Supplements cannot be less restrictive than the provisions of this AFI or the appropriate flight manual (T-1). 1.5.1.  Supplement  Coordination  Process.  Forward  MAJCOM/A3  approved  supplements, with attached AF Form 673, Request to Issue Publication, to lead command (HQ AMC/A3) for review.  HQ AMC/A3 will provide a recommendation and forward to  HQ USAF/A3TF AFI11-2KC-135V2  4 AUGUST 2017 7 for approval (according to AFPD 11-2) (T-2).Use the following OPR's email and/or physical address: AMC.A3VK.org@us.af.mil; HQ AMC/A3V, 402 Scott Dr., Unit 3A1, Scott AFB IL, 62225-5302.

Unit commanders may provide copies for all aircrew members and associated support personnel. 1.7.  Improvement  Recommendations.  Send  comments  and  suggested  improvements  to  this instruction on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, via the HQ AMC 847 Central  website   Routing procedures of the AF Form 847 for all Regular Air Force, Air Force  Reserve and Air National Guard  Units  will  be  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  AFI  11-215,  Flight  Manual  Procedures,  and MAJCOM supplement and AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management (T-1). (https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/amcedc/SitePages/847  Central). 1.8.  Evaluations.  This  instruction  establishes  standardized  instrument  (INSTM),  qualification (QUAL), mission (MSN), SPOT, and instructor (INSTR) evaluation criteria.  It also establishes the  areas/subareas  necessary  for  the  successful  completion  of  evaluations,  and  which  required areas/subareas are considered critical and/or non-critical. 1.9.  Evaluation Requirements  .  Accomplish combined evaluations whenever practical.  Crew Resource Management (CRM) skills will be evaluated on all evaluations (T-2).  KC-135 aircrew members  will  complete  the  following  evaluations  (except  SPOT  evaluations),  at  17-month frequency according to AFI 11-202V2, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement (T-2).  Units collocated  with  an  operational  simulator  facility  will  conduct  boom  operator  EPE  in  the  boom simulator  (T-2).  Units  will  conduct  pilot  INSTM  and  QUAL  flight  evaluations  in  the  flight simulator  (T-2).    The  OG/CC  is  the  waiver  authority  for  conducting  boom  operator  EPE  and INSTM/QUAL evaluations in the aircraft due to simulator availability (T-2).  Forward approved waivers to AMC/A3VK through AFRC/A3V and NGB/A3O.  In addition, document waivers in standardization and evaluation board (SEB) minutes (T-2).  Units without co-located simulators may elect to send crews to simulator locations to perform INSTM/QUAL evaluations. 1.9.1.  Instrument  (INSTM)  Evaluation.  All  KC-135  pilots  will  successfully  complete  a periodic instrument  evaluation  including an open-book, written instrument  examination and an instrument simulator or flight evaluation (T-2). 1.9.2.  Qualification  (QUAL)  Evaluation.  All  KC-135  crewmembers  will  successfully complete a periodic qualification evaluation  including the requisite open-book, closed-book and  Boldface  written  examinations,  emergency  procedures  evaluation  (EPE),  publications check,  and  a  simulator  or  flight  evaluation  (T-2).    In  addition  to  these  requirements, navigators  will  also  complete  an  open-book  written  instrument  examination  in  conjunction with all QUAL evaluations (T-2). 8 AFI11-2KC-135V2  4 AUGUST 2017 1.9.2.1.  Boom Operator EPE will be conducted in the Boom Operator Simulator System (BOSS)/Boom  Operator  Weapon  System  Trainer  (BOWST)  for  collocated  units  (T-2).  Evaluations will be conducted by an Air Force Flight Examiner (T-2). 1.9.3.  Mission  (MSN)  Evaluations.  The  KC-135  primary  mission  is  tanker  air  to  air refueling.    See  crew  position  chapters  for  additional  mission  evaluations.  All  KC-135 crewmembers  will  complete  a  mission  evaluation  as  required  in  AFI  11-202V2  and MAJCOM  SUP  (T-2).    Except  as  noted  in  the  following  crew  position  chapters,  all crewmembers will be evaluated in designated areas/subareas required in the performance of a single operational or training sortie to successfully complete the MSN evaluation (T-2). 1.9.3.1.  All  primary  crewmembers  must  be  mission  qualified  in  each  specific  mission prior to performing any maneuvers associated with that mission (example: A receiver air to  air  refueling  qualified  aircraft  commander  will  not  perform  any  receiver  air  to  air refueling  if  the  other  primary  pilot  does  not  have  a  receiver  air  to  air  refueling  mission qualification) (T-1). Exception: Crewmembers not qualified in the specific mission may perform maneuvers under the supervision of a mission qualified instructor. Refer to AFI 11-2KC-135V3,  KC-135  Operations  Procedures,  to  determine  whether  instructor supervision is required to be direct or indirect for the specific maneuver. 1.9.4.  Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations.  To initially qualify as an instructor in the KC-135, crewmembers  will  successfully  complete  an  initial  instructor  qualification  course  and evaluation (T-1).  Subsequently, aircrew members designated as instructors will be evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations (T-1).  Individuals may accomplish a  QUAL,  INSTM,  or  MSN  evaluation  in  conjunction  with  initial  INSTR  evaluation  if  all required items  of the respective evaluation  are accomplished.  Refer to  the specific aircrew chapter for requirements. 1.9.5.  SPOT  Evaluations.  A  SPOT  evaluation  is  an  evaluation  not  intended  to  satisfy  the requirements of a periodic (e.g., INSTM, QUAL, MSN) evaluation.  SPOT evaluations have no  specific  requisites  or  requirements  unless  specified  in  this  AFI  or  MAJCOM/Unit supplement.    See  AFI  11-202V2  for  options  to  convert  a  SPOT  evaluation  to  meet requirements of a periodic evaluation. 1.9.6.  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluations  (EPE).  See AFI 11-202V2 and the following: Evaluate  MSN  specific  emergency  procedures  and  system  knowledge  during  MSN evaluations.    A  single  EPE  may  be  used  for  separate  evaluations  (e.g.  a  MSN  and INSTM/QUAL  eval)  but  the  combined  EPE  must  be  of  a  scope  and  duration  to  cover required  areas  and  must  be  within  the  requisite  zone  for  each  evaluation.    Refer  to  the specific aircrew chapter for requirements and the following: 1.9.6.1.  Units will develop EPE program requirements (topics, special interests, etc.) and publish  in  unit  supplements  (T-2).    The  EPE  will  include  areas  commensurate  with  the examinee’s  level  of  training,  qualification  (e.g.  initial,  line,  instructor,  evaluator)  or  as specified  in  AFI  11-202V2  and  MAJCOM  Supplement  (T-2).    Units  may  utilize  EPs demonstrated  during  simulator  evaluations  to  fulfill  this  requirement.    Collocated  units with a BOSS/BOWST will conduct the EPE in the WST (T-2). AFI11-2KC-135V2  4 AUGUST 2017 9 1.9.6.2.  Examinees  may  use  publications  that  are  normally  available  in-flight.    The examinee must be able to recite all Boldface items from memory and provide the initial actions of selected emergency procedures that would not allow time for reference (T-2). 1.9.6.3.  Examinees  receiving  an  overall  EPE  grade  of  unqualified  will  be  placed  in supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed (T-2).   Examinees  receiving  an  overall  EPE  grade  of  unqualified  because  of unsatisfactory  Boldface  procedures will not  be permitted to  fly in  their aircrew position until  a  successful  re-evaluation  is  accomplished  (T-2).    Accomplish  additional  training IAW AFI 11-202V2. 1.9.7.  Evaluation Prefixes/Unique MSN Suffixes.  Use AFI 11-202V2 evaluation prefixes for  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification,  and  AF  Form  942,  Record  of Evaluation.    Utilize  “Cargo”  or  “ARR”  (air  refueling  receiver)  parenthetical  (e.g.  MSN (Cargo), MSN  (ARR),  MSN (ARRIP)) to  distinguish  unique MSN  evaluations in  the flight phase section of the AF Form 8 and AF Form 942 (T-2).  The first entry of the AF Form 8, Examiners Remarks, A. Mission Description will describe the circumstances for any required evaluation prefix or unique mission suffix (T-2). 1.9.8.  Manual  Gear  Extension  and  Manual  Flap  Lowering.  Mandatory on all navigator initial  mission  and  initial  instructor  evaluations  (T-2).    Mandatory  on  all  boom  operator initial qualification and initial instructor evaluations (T-2).  For initial qualification and initial mission  evaluations,  flap  lowering  should  be  evaluated  in-flight  but  at  the  discretion  of  the evaluator may be accomplished on the ground. 1.10.  Grading Policies  . 1.10.1.  Use  the  grading  criteria  in  this  instruction  in  conjunction  with  AFI  11-202V2  to grade areas/subareas accomplished during an evaluation (T-2). 1.10.2.  When  in-flight  or  simulator  evaluation  of  a  required  area  is  not  possible,  the  area may be verbally evaluated.  Flight examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas/subareas via flight, simulator or static training tools before resorting to this provision, to  include  scheduling  an  evaluation  completion  sortie/simulator  (T-2).  When  a  verbal evaluation  is  used,  the  evaluator  will  identify  the  area  or  items  within  the  area  that  were verbally evaluated on AF Form 8 as an examiner remark (following the mission description) (T-2). 1.10.2.1.  For pilots  only, if the flight  manual  recommends a specific airspeed range for performance  of  a  maneuver,  the  flight  examiner  will  apply  the  grading  criteria  to  the upper and lower limits of that range (T-2). 1.10.2.2.  Flight  examiners  will  use  sound  judgment  in  the  application  of  the  grading criteria in this instruction to determine the final grade (T-2). 1.11.  Grading System.  Refer to AFI 11-202V2. 1.12.  Conduct of Evaluations. 1.12.1.  Flight  examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct,  purpose, requirements of  the  evaluation,  and  all  applicable  evaluation  criteria  (T-2).    Flight  examiners  will  then evaluate the examinee in each graded area/subarea (T-2). 10 AFI11-2KC-135V2  4 AUGUST 2017 1.12.1.1.  Flight  examiners  will  normally  not  evaluate  personnel  they  have  primarily trained, their effectiveness/performance reports (A). recommended evaluation, or  who render for upgrade 1.12.1.2.  Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any crew position/seat which will best enable the flight examiner to observe the examinee’s performance.  As a last resort, evaluator pilots may conduct evaluations when scheduled as  primary  aircrew  members  and  in  this  case  will  perform  all  duties  required  of  that position (e.g., mandatory advisory calls, etc.). 1.12.2.  Note  discrepancies  and  deviations  from  prescribed  tolerances  and  performance criteria  during  the  evaluation  (T-2).    Compare  the  examinee’s  performance  with  the tolerances provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each area (T-2). 1.12.2.1.  An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting substandard  performance,  nor  will  a  training  mission  be  changed  to  an  evaluation  after crew brief time unless to facilitate a SPOT evaluation. (T-2). 1.12.2.2.  The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202V2, and this instruction will be the determining  factors in assigning an overall grade (T-2).  The flight  examiner  will  thoroughly  critique  all  aspects  of  the  flight  (T-2).    During  the critique,  the  flight  examiner  will  review  the  examinee’s  overall  rating,  specific deviations, area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required (T-2). 1.12.2.3.  In the event  of unsatisfactory performance, the flight  examiner  will determine additional  training  requirements  and  restrictions,  whether  critical  or  non-critical  (T-2).  Normally,  additional  training  should  not  be  accomplished  on  the  same  flight  (T-3).  Exception:    Additional  training  on  the  same  flight  is  allowed  when,  in  the  evaluator’s judgment, unique situations presenting valuable training opportunities (e.g., thunderstorm avoidance,  crosswind  landings)  exist.    This  option  requires  utmost  flight  examiner discretion  and  judicious  application.    When  used,  the  examinee  must  be  informed  of when the additional training begins and ends (T-2). 1.12.2.4.  When  evaluations  are  less  than  Q-1  performance,  the  flight  examiner  will debrief the examinee and examinee’s commander or designated representative (T-2). 1.12.3.  A  certified  simulator/training  device  will  be  used  to  accomplish  additional  training and  re-checks  when  available  and  when  criteria  to  be  graded  can  be  realistically accomplished in the device (T-2). 1.12.4.  The flight examiner who administered the original evaluation will not administer the recheck, unless there is  no other option available to ensure timely completion of evaluation (T-2). 1.13.  Unsatisfactory  Performance  -  NOTE:  This  paragraph  is  for  reference  only  and  may duplicate  information  in  AFI  11-202V2,  allowing  the  evaluator  a  single-source  instruction  to conduct the evaluation. When a conflict occurs, use AFI 11-202V2. 1.13.1.  Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline. When an examinee jeopardizes  safety  of  flight,  the  evaluator  may  assume  the  duties  of  that  aircrew  member. AFI11-2KC-135V2  4 AUGUST 2017 11 This  does  not  mean  the  flight  examiner  must  assume  the  examinee’s  position  any  time unsatisfactory performance is observed. 1.13.2.  Conduct  a  thorough  pre-mission  briefing  and  post-mission  debriefing  to  the examinee and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation. 1.13.3.  Assign  a  qualification  level  of  “Q-3”  for  unsatisfactory  performance  in  any  critical area/sub-area or if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties. 1.13.4.  Immediately  notify  the  examinee’s  Squadron  Commander/Operations  Officer  and Flight Commander, if available, when less than Q-1 performance is observed. 1.13.5.  Unsatisfactory  performance  in  a  non-critical  area/subarea  will  result  in  no  higher than a qualification level “Q-2.” 1.13.6.  Annotate in the Examiner Remarks on the Form 8 what the cause of the discrepancy was,  what  recommended  retraining  is  required,  and  what  actions  are  required  to  regain qualification (flight or ground recheck, written examination, etc). 1.13.7.  Flight examiners observing unsatisfactory performance by a crewmember other than the examinee (including one in a different crew position) will comply with the requirements in AFI 11-202V2. 1.14.  Use  of  AF  Form  3862,  Aircrew  Evaluation  Worksheet.    Units  (normally  OGV)  will overprint  AF  Form  3862  (or  PEX/GTIMS  equivalent),  using  the  examples  at  Attachment  2, Attachment 3, or Attachment 4, to use as an evaluation worksheet (T-2).  Copy each title, area number  and  text  (in  the  order  illustrated)  to  the  appropriate  blocks.    Units  may  add  special interest  items  and/or  local  evaluation  requirements.    Use  the  worksheet  to  ensure  all  required areas are evaluated.  File the examiner-signed worksheet or draft copy of the AF Form 8 in the aircrew  member’s  Flight  Evaluation  Folder  (FEF)  immediately  after  the  flight  evaluation  as  a temporary record of the evaluation results (T-2).  Maintain until the finished AF Form 8 is added to the FEF, then discard. 1.14.1.  Trends.  Record  performance  data  for  tracking  aircrew  trends  (T-2).    Performance information is required only for major areas; units may optionally record information for sub-areas  (example:  a  40  flap  landing  followed  by  a  touch-and-go  can  be  recorded  under  the major  area  of  “Landings”  or  can  optionally  be  recorded  under  both  “Normal  Landing”  and “Touch-and-Go”). 1.15.  Aircrew  Testing.  For  all testing  requirements  are prerequisites.  For  all  other  evaluations,  testing  requirements  are  requisites.  See  specific  testing requirements in AFI 11-202V2 and include the following: initial  and  RQ  evaluations, 1.15.1.  Secure  Question  Bank  (SQB,  or  PEX/GTIMS  equivalent).  Each  unit  will maintain a SQB from which Open Book and  Instructor Open Book (if used by unit) exams will be derived (T-2).  The unit SQB may be a single question bank (containing all questions for  all  crewmembers)  or  may  be  separate  question  banks  (separate  question  banks  for  each crew  position,  mission,  and/or  aircraft  type;  there  may  also  be  classified  and  unclassified SQBs). As a minimum, SQB questions will be drawn from appropriate information contained in FCIF Volumes I, II, III, and IV (per AFI 11-202 Volume 2); however, questions may come from  any  source  deemed  pertinent  to  the  operation  of  unit  aircraft  and  performance  of  the assigned mission (T-2). 12 AFI11-2KC-135V2  4 AUGUST 2017 1.15.2.  Open  Book  Exam  (Open  Book).  The  open  book  examination  will  consist  of  a minimum of 40 questions from the SQB (T-2). 1.15.3.  Closed  Book  (Closed  Book).  The closed book exam will consist of a minimum of 20 questions derived from the MAJCOM-produced Master Question File (MQF) (T-2).  All crewmembers  with  Boldface  responsibilities  will  complete  a  Boldface  exam  in  conjunction with the closed book examination (T-2). 1.15.4.  Instrument  Exam.  Pilots  and  navigators  only,  see  AFI  11-202V2  instrument requirements. 1.15.5.  Instructor Open Book.  Units may maintain a separate SQB for instructors. 1.16.  Typical KC-135 Evaluation Profile. 1.16.1.  Units determine a flight evaluation profile to maximize successful completion of all evaluation requirements on a single in-flight mission.  A typical profile may include takeoff, cruise, rendezvous, air to air refueling (AAR), and transition when pilot QUAL and INSTM portions are to be accomplished in-flight along with the MSN evaluation.   Aircrew training simulator  (ATS)  profiles  will  be  used  for  accomplishment  of  simulator  evaluations  (T-2).  Flight  examiners  may  alter  the  order  of  maneuver  accomplishment  and  may  request  to  see additional  maneuvers.  Once  an  evaluation  begins,  it  should  not  be  terminated  until  the evaluation debrief except for emergencies, at the evaluator’s discretion. 1.17.  Senior Officer Requirements  .  See AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training. AFI11-2KC-135V2  4 AUGUST 2017 13 Chapter 2 PILOT EVALUATIONS 2.1.  General.  This  chapter  standardizes  initial,  periodic,  and  re-qualification  evaluations, including the requirements for instrument, qualification, mission, and instructor pilot evaluations. 2.1.1.  Events that are accomplished during ATS portion of the evaluation are not required to be evaluated again (e.g. if a non-precision approach is flown during a one engine inoperative approach and landing, it does not have to be re-accomplished during the instrument phase of the  check  ride);  however  a  landing  will  be  accomplished  in  flight  in  conjunction  with  the MSN  evaluation  (T-2).    Events  accomplished  during  the  conduct  of  a  normal  MSN  check profile are not required to be reaccomplished during the INSTM or QUAL check. 2.1.2.  Examiner pilots will utilize the standard ATS evaluation profile (T-2).  Ceiling for all simulator evaluations will be set no lower than 200 feet above the lowest compatible circling approach  minimums  (T-2).    Visibility  will  be  set  no  lower  than  1  mile  above  the  lowest compatible  circling  approach  minimums  (T-2).    Crosswinds  for  simulator  evaluations  will not be greater than 10 knots (T-2). 2.2.  Instrument  Evaluations  (Initial,  Periodic  and  Re-qualifications).  KC-135  instrument evaluations  should  be  combined  with  a  qualification  evaluation.    Include  all  items  under GENERAL and INSTRUMENT. 2.3.  Qualification Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification).  KC-135 qualification evaluations should be combined with instrument evaluation.  Include all areas under GENERAL, and  QUALIFICATION.    The  OG/CC  is  the  waiver  authority  for  conducting  INST/QUAL evaluations  in  the  aircraft  due  to  simulator  availability.  Forward  approved  waivers  to MAJCOM/A3V and document waivers in unit SEB minutes (T-2). 2.3.1.  FP (senior officer), FP (  flight qualified mission ready MPD pilot), MP (mission pilot),  IP  (instructor  pilot).    Evaluate  FP  and  MP  on  at  least  one  landing  in  both  left  and right seats (T-2). IPs may receive all periodic evaluations in either seat, but are not required to  be  evaluated  in  both.    If  an  IP  evaluation  takes  place  in  the  right  seat,  taxi  and  full-stop braking do not need to be evaluated. 2.3.2.  Senior  Officer  and  Flight  Training  Level  E  (FTL-E)  Basic  Qualification.  Senior Officer  and  FTL-E  initial,  periodic  and  re-qualification  evaluations  include  will  a  takeoff, precision approach, non-precision approach, VFR pattern, go-around, and a landing. Area 16, engine out operations and Area 28, circling approach are not required.  Entire QUAL/INSTM evaluation will be conducted in simulator IAW para 1.9 for collocated units (T-2). 2.3.2.1.  Conduct an EPE in a random selection of Boldface procedures. 2.3.2.2.  Testing requirements.  Initial, periodic and re-qualification evaluations include the following requisites (T-2): 2.3.2.2.1.  Instrument exam. 2.3.2.2.2.  KC-135 Open book test. 2.3.2.2.3.  KC-135 Closed book test. 14 AFI11-2KC-135V2  4 AUGUST 2017 2.3.2.2.4.  Boldface exam. 2.3.2.3.  Annotate AF Form 8 crew position as “FP”, type of evaluation is QUAL/INSTM and  include  an  expiration  date.    Add  the  following  restriction  in  the  remarks:  “RESTRICTION:    This  evaluation  permits  operating  the  aircraft  from  a  primary  crew position only under direct supervision of an instructor pilot during all critical-phases-of-flight.” 2.3.2.4.  SOC  graduates  and  FTL-E  pilots  must  complete  a  MSN,  INST,  and  QUAL evaluation to gain full mission ready status.  See AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 1 for training requirements. 2.4.  Mission Evaluations  (Initial, Periodic, and Re-qualifications).  Mission evaluations will be flown IAW current tactics, unit taskings, and theater Area of Responsibility scenarios (T-2).  Scenarios that represent unit Designated Operational Capability (DOC) or OPLAN taskings and current  AEF  requirements  satisfy  the  requirements  of  this  evaluation.  Evaluations  may  be conducted  during  exercises,  deployments,  or  contingency  operations;  however,  units  should apply operational risk management principles to the scheduling of the evaluation. 2.4.1.  Include all areas under GENERAL and MISSION (Tanker AAR) (T-2).  Rendezvous is  required  (T-2).    Receiver  must  maintain  the  contact  position  (minimum  duration determined  by  evaluator)  but  an  actual  offload  is  not  required.    Autopilot-off  AAR  is required on at least one contact (minimum duration determined by evaluator) (T-2). 2.4.2.  Pilots can be evaluated in either seat and will be evaluated on AAR and a breakaway. Breakaway  may  be  evaluated  as  either  the  pilot  flying  or  the  pilot  monitoring  (T-2).    Each pilot will be graded based on procedures applicable to their crew position (T-2).  Breakaway procedures  can  be  evaluated  with  receiver  not  in  contact,  but  within  the  AAR  envelope.  Each evaluatee must perform a landing (T-2). 2.5.  Additional Qualification/Mission Evaluations. 2.5.1.  Receiver  AAR.  Include all areas under GENERAL and MISSION (Receiver AAR).  For  initial/re-qualification  evaluations,  rendezvous  or  closure  from  a  minimum  of  1  NM  is required.    Initial  and  re-qualification  pilots  will  demonstrate  15  minutes  of  contact  time within  a  30-minute  period  of  arriving  in  the  astern  position  (T-2).    Evaluate  aircraft commanders  in  left  seat  (T-2).    Evaluate  instructors  in  either  seat.    During  periodic evaluations,  pilots  will  perform  10  minutes  of  contact  time  within  a  20-minute  period  of arriving  in  the  astern  position  (T-2).    Evaluate  limits  demonstrations  for  instructor  pilots, inadvertent disconnect tolerances and breakaway procedures (T-2).  Conduct a portion of the evaluation  with  tanker  autopilot  off.    Annotate  “Receiver  AAR  Qualified”  in  the  remarks section. 2.5.1.1.  Annotate AF  Form 8 as “INIT MSN (ARR)” for initial  and “MSN (ARR)” for recurring  receiver  AAR  evaluations.  Annotate  the  AF  Form  8  with  “INIT  MSN (ARRIP)”  for  initial  receiver  AAR  instructor  evaluations.    Subsequent  recurring  MSN evaluations for air refueling instructor pilots will be annotated as “MSN (ARR)” (T-2). 2.5.2.  Operational  Mission  Evaluation  (OME).  An  OME  is  a  flight  evaluation  given  to prospective aircraft commanders prior to aircraft commander certification.  The profile must be balanced between mission availability and the imperative to not delay aircraft commander AFI11-2KC-135V2  4 AUGUST 2017 15 certification.  The evaluation profile is at the discretion of the operations group commander as  defined  locally.    With  OG/CC  or  equivalent  approval,  a  full  qualification/instrument and/or  mission  evaluation  administered  just  prior  to  aircraft  commander  certification  may satisfy this requirement.  If a qualification/instrument and/or mission evaluation is used, the focus for the evaluation shall be on decision making and CRM (T-2). 2.5.2.1.  Documentation.  If  documenting  an  OME  on  the  AF  Form  8,  use  the  “SPOT” evaluation  and  include  the  following  comment  in  the  remarks  section,  “This  OME  was conducted in conjunction with aircraft commander certification.” 2.5.2.2.  If  this  evaluation  is  intended  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  a  periodic qualification/instrument and/or mission evaluation, comply with the requirements in AFI 11-202V2 and this AFI (T-2).  Annotate with “INIT” prefix and include the remark “This evaluation was conducted in conjunction with aircraft commander certification.” 2.6.  Instructor Evaluation.  Flight examiners will place particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and provide timely, effective and corrective action (T-2).  At a minimum, demonstrate and instruct a variety of approaches. Note: 1.  Pilots who desire to realign  their  INSTM/QUAL/MSN  evaluation  during  the  initial  instructor  evaluation  will complete  (demonstrate)  all  required  areas/subareas in  GENERAL,  QUALIFICATION, MISSION  (Tanker  AAR),  INSTRUCTOR,  and  complete  all  required  requisite  written examinations  (T-2).  Note:  2.    For  Receiver  AAR  by  an  instructor  pilot,  limited  inadvertent disconnects are permissible during a boom limits demonstration and will not be counted against the  instructor  pilot  examinee  at  the  examiner’s  discretion  (T-2).  Note:    3.    Initial  instructor evaluations combined with a QUAL or MSN evaluation that results in a Q3 requires successful completion  of  the  failed  QUAL  or  MSN  evaluation  before  attempting  another  INIT  INSTR evaluation (T-2). 2.6.1.  Conduct  initial  or  requalification  instructor  evaluations  with  a  qualified  pilot occupying  the  other  seat  (T-2).    Initial  instructor  evaluations  are  to  be  conducted  in  the simulator whenever possible and may be completed in the traffic pattern. When conducted in the aircraft, initial  instructor examinees will occupy the right  seat  and a qualified instructor (or evaluator) will sit in the other seat for IP-only maneuvers and demos (T-2). 2.6.2.  Administer  periodic  instructor  evaluations  in  conjunction  with  INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation.    Include  all  areas  under  GENERAL,  QUALIFICATION,  MISSION  (Tanker AAR), MISSION (Receiver AAR) (if applicable), INSTRUMENT, and INSTRUCTOR. 2.7.  Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE).  Unit determines EPE requirements.  EPE will normally be conducted in certified simulator in conjunction with INSTM/QUAL evaluation (T-2).    One-on-one  discussions  or  on-aircraft  evaluation  methods  may  be  utilized  when  certified simulator is not available to conduct the EPE.  The EPE should cover a cross section of aircraft systems.    Examinees  should  be  able  to  demonstrate  an  understanding  of  aircraft  systems  in emergency  scenarios.    Include  situations  during  takeoff/climb-out,  cruise,  and  approach  to landing phases.  The EPE may also include emergency egress, aircrew flight equipment  (AFE), and FCIF and/or special interest identified EPE topics. 2.8.  Pilot Grading Criteria. 2.8.1.
