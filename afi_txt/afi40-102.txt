Ban  on  smoking  in  POVs  if  children  under  age  14  has  been  removed.    MDG  CCs  may require  tobacco  cessation  class  attendance  as  a  requirement  for  issuing  of  tobacco  cessation medications  if  the  CC  certifies  that  class  availability  does  not  create  a  barrier  to  potential attendees.  OPR is changed to AF/SG3/5P.  Family and Unaccompanied housing responsibilities have been moved under Civil Engineering, although authority to designate housing tobacco free is placed under the installation CC.  Additional information regarding DTAs, their requirements and maintenance has been added under CE and Installation Commander responsibilities and the definition  of  DTAs.    FSS/CC  is  identified  as  having  primary  responsibility  to  work  with bargaining unit civilian employees. AFI40-102  4 MARCH 2015 3 Chapter 1 TOBACCO FREE LIVING PROGRAM OVERVIEW 1.1.  Background.  Tobacco use is  the leading cause of preventable death in  the United States. Tobacco  use  degrades  Air  Force  readiness,  health,  and  leads  to  preventable  health  care  costs.  The  Air  Force  discourages  the  use  of  all  tobacco  products.  Commanders  and  leaders  should promote Tobacco Free Living in  accordance with the Department of Defense’s membership on the National Prevention Council and commitment to advance the National Prevention Strategy. 1.2.  Definition.  Tobacco  includes  all  products  that  may  be  configured  to  deliver  nicotine, including  but  not  limited  to,  cigars;  cigarettes;  electronic  cigarettes  (e-cigarettes);  stem  pipes; water  pipes;  hookahs;  vaporizers;  smokeless  products  that  are  chewed,  dipped,  sniffed,  or “vaped”; and any other nicotine delivery system that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines as a tobacco product.  NOTE:  The definition of tobacco does not include FDA-approved prescription or over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy 4 AFI40-102  4 MARCH 2015 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.
