Overview.  The  Air  Force  (AF)  uses  electronic  communications  systems  such  as telephones,  cellular  phones,  radios,  pagers,  computers,  computer  networks,  internet-based capabilities  (IbC)  such  as  blogs,  web-sites,  social  networking  sites,  etc.,  and  other  wired  or wireless  electronic  devices  to  conduct  day-to-day  official  business.    Adversaries  can  easily monitor  these  systems  to  gather  information  regarding  military  capabilities,  limitations, intentions, and activities. Electronic System Security Assessment (ESSA) provides commanders with an assessment as to the type and amount of information traversing Department of Defense (DOD) electronic communication systems that is at risk to adversary collection and exploitation. ESSA products can be used to evaluate personnel compliance with Information, Personnel, and Industrial  Security  practices;  Communications  Security  (COMSEC)  and  Cybersecurity procedures,  and  the  implementation  of  Military  Deception,  and  Operations  Security  (OPSEC) activities.  ESSA  products  are  also  used  to  support  other  security  operations,  activities,  and programs to enhance force protection, and focus training requirements. 1.2.  Purpose.  The Air Force conducts ESSAs using the CDA WS to support OPSEC analysis of protection  measures  for  AF  Core  Functions.    ESSA  monitoring  involves  the  collection  and analysis of information transmitted via DOD electronic communication systems.  These systems can include radios, wired or wireless telephones, and computer networks.  ESSA products help commanders  evaluate  their  organization's  Information,  Personnel  and  Industrial  Security practices; COMSEC, Wing Cybersecurity office, and OPSEC posture by determining the amount and type of information available to adversary collection entities. 1.2.1.  The  AF  monitors,  collects,  and  analyzes  information  from  DOD  electronic communications systems to determine if any critical or classified information transmitted via unsecured  and  unprotected  systems  could  adversely  affect  US  (and  allied/coalition) operations. 1.2.2.  CDA operations are an integral part of AF OPSEC, Information Operations (IO), and Red  Teaming.  It  is  a  very  effective  tool  to  identify  real  world  problems  that  can  adversely affect the warfighter’s effectiveness. During assessments, items such as stereotyped patterns or  administrative,  technical,  and  physical  security  procedures  routinely  surface  as  possible sources of intelligence losses. 1.3.  CDA  Authority.  Headquarters  Air  Force  Space  Command  (HQ  AFSPC)  CDA  elements (including  its  gained  or  associated  reserve  units)  are  the  only  AF  organizations  authorized  to conduct  CDA  activities.    These  activities  are  accomplished  within  certain  legal  parameters utilizing  authorized  tools  to  monitor,  collect,  and  transfer  telecommunication  data  for  analysis.  They perform CDA activities in a manner that satisfies the legitimate needs of the AF to provide OPSEC assessments while protecting the legal rights and civil  liberties of those persons whose communications are subject to CDA monitoring. 1.3.1.  The  authority  to  monitor  AF  networks  in  the  course  of  network  defense  is  derived from the service provider exceptions to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 USC 2111(2)(a)(i)  and  18  USC  3121(b)(1);  the  2008  National  Security  Presidential  Directive-54/Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive-23  (NSPD-54/HSPD-23),  which  directed AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 5 initiatives  to  monitor  Federal  information  systems  for  network  security  purposes;  the National  Defense  Authorization  Act  (NDAA)  Section  931,  codified  as  a  note  to  10  USC 2223,  NDAA  2012,  Section  953;  Department  of  Defense  Directive  (DODD)  O-8530.1, Computer Network Defense, and DOD Instruction (DODI) 8500.01, Cybersecurity. 1.3.2.  CDA  Missions:  The  CDA  WS  currently  conducts  three  separate  missions:  Active Indicator Monitoring (AIM) in support of cyberspace network defense and ESSA in support of OPSEC mission sets and Cyberspace Operations Risk Assessment (CORA) in support of Cybersecurity.  1.3.2.1.  AIM  –  Protect  the  Air  Force,  DOD  and  government  networks.    AIM  missions identify and report disclosed information that could be used to gain authorized access to compromise Air Force Networks and devices.  AIM tools include, but are not limed to e-mail and  IbC. 1.3.2.2.  ESSA-  Protect  information  pertaining  to  Air  Force,  DOD  and  government operations,  capabilities,  and  resources.    ESSA  missions  identify  and  report  disclosed information  that  could  be  used  to  compromise  missions,  gain  access  to  sensitive capabilities, and deny knowledge of critical resources.  ESSA utilizes the following tools: telephony,  e-mail,  IbC,  radio  frequency  (RF),  and  web  risk  assessment  (WRA).  Authority  is  derived  from  DODI  8560.01,  Communications  Security  (COMSEC) Monitoring and Information Assurance (IA) Readiness Testing. 1.3.2.3.  CORA - Mitigate the effects of lost Air Force, DOD and government operations, capabilities,  and  resources.   CORA  missions  analyze  potential  and  confirmed compromised  data  from  adversary  exfiltration  or  friendly  transmission  outside  of  U.S. Government control, with the objective of determining the associated impact to Air Force operations and technology resulting from the data loss.  CORA applies OPSEC principles and  processes  in  the  conduct  of  responsive  and  systematic  analysis  of  the  content  of compromised data leaving the AFIN.  While there are other similar capabilities analyzing compromised computers and networks, they are focused on methods, techniques, system vulnerability identification, and the identification or attribution of an adversary.  CORA is  a contributor to the overall  Information  Damage Assessment  (IDA) process  based on evidence  that  data  was  or  potentially  exfiltrated  from  an  AF  system  due  to  adversaries’ cyber  activities.    When  conducting  CORA  missions  CDA  units  are  not  monitoring  or collecting any information from the AFIN.  CORA is focused on the nature and content of the compromised information itself, and the potential impact of its loss within the final IDA  product.    CORA  capabilities  assist  information  owners  in  determining  the operational  risk  and  impact  of  compromised  information.    CORA  utilizes  the  following tools: e-mail,  IbC and Data at Rest.  Authority is derived from AFI 10-1701, Command and Control (C2) for Cyberspace Operations. 6 AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 Figure 1.1.  Cyberspace Defense Analysis Mission Breakdown. 1.3.3.  The  AF  conducts  continuous  monitoring  that  can  be  tasked  and  focused  to  defend specific  information  via  Information  Defense  Priorities.  Information  Defense  Priorities  can be based on Air  Force organizations, mission sets, capabilities, weapon systems, platforms, or any other significant categorization of Air Force owned information.  1.3.3.1.  All  organization  OPSEC  Program  Managers  (OPSEC  PM)  will  supply  CDA units  with  Information  Defense  Priorities  through  their  major  command  (MAJCOM)  or direct  reporting  unit  (DRU)  OPSEC  PM  for  inclusion  in  the  continuous  monitoring mission.  (T-1). 1.3.3.2.  OPSEC  PMs  and  members  of  the  AF  OPSEC  Support  Team  (AF  OST)  can request  a  Focused  Look  Assessment  through  their  MAJCOM,  DRU,  or  field  operating agency  (FOA)  OPSEC  PM  that  includes  any  number  of  Information  Defense  Priorities specific  to  a  single  Air  Force  core  function,  organization,  mission  set,  capability,  or weapon  system.  A  Focused  Look  Assessment  can  cover  multiple  organizations, installations, or locations. 1.3.3.3.  Organization  requested  Focused  Look  Assessments  are  submitted  by  the Headquarters  AF  (HAF),  AF  OST,  MAJCOM,  DRU,  or  FOA  OPSEC  PM  to  the  624th Operations  Center  (OC).    Most  CDA  activities  are  provided  at  no  cost  to  the  assessed organization.    However,  if  the  assessed  organization’s  requires  a  mode  of  monitoring (e.g., RF, ref para. 1.3.4.4 and 3.5.) requiring physical proximity or requests an in-person mission  out-brief,  the  requesting  organization  must  fund  the  travel  of  the  CDA  team performing  the  ESSA  mission.    Refer  to  paragraph  3.1  for  further  details.  Monitoring resources  can  be  adjusted  during  exercises,  crises,  contingencies,  and  conflicts.  The monitoring  and  subsequent  assessing  of  data  are  designed  to  thoroughly  examine communications  systems  procedures  associated  with  a  specific  weapons  system, operation,  or  activity,  and  document  their  vulnerability  to  hostile  intelligence  collection and exploitation. These assessments are also  conducted to  provide information  and data into  the  OPSEC  risk  analysis  process,  gauge  the  overall  effectiveness  of  a  program  or operation, and to support cybersecurity objectives. AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 7 1.3.4.  The following ESSA monitoring capabilities are available to a commander and the AF OST: 1.3.4.1.  Telephony – The monitoring and assessment of AF unclassified voice networks which if exploited by adversaries, can negatively impact AF operations. 1.3.4.2.  Email  Communications  –  The  monitoring  and  assessment  of  unclassified  AF email  traffic  entering  or  exiting  the  AFIN  which  if  exploited  by  adversaries,  can negatively impact AF operations. 1.3.4.3.  IbC  –  The  monitoring  and  assessment  of  unencrypted  SMTP  and  HTTP communications  that  either  enter  or  leave  the  AF  Gateway  architecture.  NOTE:  CDA units  only  “monitor”  the  web  sessions  that  transverse  the  AFIN  and  not  the  IbC  sites themselves.    IbCs  include  collaborative  tools  such  as  social  networking  sites  (SNS), social  media,  user-generated  content,  social  software,  e-mail,  instant  messaging,  and discussion forums (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, Google Apps, etc.). 1.3.4.4.  Radio Frequency (RF) Communications – The monitoring and assessment of AF communications within the VHF, UHF, FM, HF, and SHF frequency bands (e.g., mobile phones,  land  mobile  radios,  wireless  local  area  networks)  which  if  exploited  by adversaries, can negatively impact AF operations. 1.3.4.5.  Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA) –The analysis of compromised data from adversary exfiltration or friendly transmission outside of U.S. Government control, with  the  objective  of  determining  the  associated  impact  to  Air  Force  operations  and technology resulting from the data loss. CORA applies OPSEC principles and processes in the conduct of responsive and systematic analysis of the content of compromised data leaving  the  AFIN.  While  there  are  other  similar  capabilities  analyzing  compromised computers and networks, they are focused on methods, techniques, system  vulnerability identification,  and  the  identification  or  attribution  of  an  adversary.    CORA  is  a contributor  to  the  overall  IDA  process.    It  is  focused  on  the  nature  and  content  of  the compromised information itself, and the potential impact of its loss within the final IDA product. CORA capabilities assist information owners in determining the operational risk and impact of compromised information. 1.3.4.5.1.  CORA is a specific assessment that can be generated by user request, as a 624 OC directed follow-on tasking after compromised data is discovered or as a near real-time assessment to support mission assurance or information damage assessment. 1.3.4.5.2.  Reports  generated  as  a  result  of  a  CORA  tasking  are  not  subject  to  the limiting  instructions  of  other  ESSA  reports.    CORA  reports  may  be  used  for subsequent reports, such as Foreign Intelligence or Counterintelligence bulletins. 1.3.4.6.  WRA  –  The  assessment  of  information  posted  on  AF  unclassified,  owned, leased, or operated public and private web sites in order to minimize exploitation of AF information by adversaries that can negatively impact AF operations. 1.4.  Notice  and  Consent.  Although  not  a  part  of  the  CDA  WS,  notice  and  consent  is  a  legal requirement before monitoring can be conducted, and is therefore integrated into this instruction. All authorized users of communications systems and devices must receive notice that monitoring is  conducted  and  use  of  the  system  or  device  constitutes  consent  to  monitoring.  All  DOD 8 AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 electronic  communication  systems  are  subject  to  monitoring  for  authorized  purposes  as prescribed by DODI 8560.01, Communications Security (COMSEC) Monitoring and Information Assurance (IA) Readiness Testing, DODD 5205.02, Operations Security (OPSEC) Program, and AFI 33-200, Information Assurance (IA) Management. 1.4.1.

Classify  and  mark  ESSA  products  according  to  security  classification  guides,  DOD Manual  (DODM)  5200.01,  Volumes  2  and  4,  Information  Security  Program;  Marking  and Control  Unclassified  Information,  and  current  policy  and  guidance.    Contact  the  unit  security manager  to  receive  Derivative  Classification  training  prior  to  marking  any  document.    This training is required IAW Presidential Executive Order 13526, Part 2 – Derivative Classification, Section 2.1. 2.4.  Types  of  ESSA  Products.  There  are  two  basic  types  of  ESSA  products,  consisting  of reports and transcripts. Paragraphs 2.4.1 through 2.4.2 of this instruction describe exceptions to the  restrictions  on  the  dissemination  and  retention  of  ESSA  products.    In  the  circumstances described  in  those  exceptions,  the  resulting  notifications  are  not  ESSA  products  and  operators should follow the procedures in Paragraph 3.2 and other applicable regulations. 2.4.1.  Reports.  ESSA  reports  provide  operational  commanders  with  near  real-time  reports of  classified  or  critical  information  disclosures  that  may  adversely  affect  U.S.  (and allied/coalition) operations.  Reporting formats should be tailored to meet the circumstances of the ESSA and the individual needs of the customer.  Operational commanders should use these  reports  for  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  OPSEC  countermeasures,  and  developing measures to diminish the value of disclosed information.  They may also use these reports to identify  and  focus  training  requirements  and  to  justify  developing  and  funding  corrective actions.  ESSA reports include; information protection alerts (IPA), immediate reports trend reports,  and  summary  reports.  ESSA  reports  are  provided  to  all  organizations  effected whether the ESSA is a part of continuous monitoring or a Focused Look Assessment.  ESSA AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 21 products are sent to those organizations that are impacted by the information disclosure, data loss,  or  vulnerability  trend.    (T-1).    At  a  minimum,  a  copy  of  all  sanitized  ESSA  products will  be  sent  to  the  HHQ  OPSEC  PM  of  all  the  affected  organizations  and  the  Air  Force OPSEC Support Element (OSE) when the disclosing organization is scheduled for an OPSEC external  assessment.    (T-1).    Reports  should  not  supply  sufficient  data  to  identify  an individual to  those elements   Reports may include short quotes, extracts,  or sanitized email attachments as needed to clarify information, but not entire reproductions of communications  Trend  and  summary  reports  will  include  applicable  threat  information.    Specific  limited exceptions  for  authorized  distribution  and  use  of  products  with  attribution  are  provided  in 3.2.  (T-1). 2.4.1.1.  An IPA is  a shortened reporting format used to notify the customer of possible disclosures  upon  discovery  during  an  ongoing  assessment.    These  reports  may  contain information of value to hostile intelligence services, unclassified critical  information, or information pertaining to the movement of high level distinguished visitors (DV).  IPAs are ESSA products and should not be used to satisfy notification requirements for events that require full attribution as outlined in paragraph 3.2.2 through 3.2.7 of this instruction.  2.4.1.2.  An  immediate  report  provides  time-critical  information,  force  protection information,  compromises  of  classified  information,  and/or  mission  critical  information during exercise and real world operations. 2.4.1.3.  Trend reports are issued at varying intervals e.g., whenever analysis uncovers a significant  trend  of  damage  and/or  vulnerabilities.    These  reports  may  summarize  and analyze damage and/or vulnerabilities covered in previous ESSA reports, CORA damage assessments, or OPSEC indicators in aggregate that uncover larger vulnerabilities.  Trend reports  may  be  labeled  as  ESSA,  but  may  contain  information  from  ESSA-derived  as-well-as non-ESSA-derived sources.  In cases where ESSA-derived information is cited in this  report,  it  must  be  properly  labeled  as  “ESSA-derived”  information  and  adhere  to other handling requirements identified in section 2.3, 3.2, and 3.3 of this instruction. 2.4.1.4.  Summary  reports  are  used  to  review  all  information  gathered  following  a completed  organization  requested  Focused  Look  Assessment.  The  summary  report reviews all information put at risk or compromised and all information in aggregate used during the risk and damage assessments. This report is typically issued with 60 calendar days  after  the  assessment  is  completed.  Summary  reports  may  be  labeled  as  ESSA,  but may  contain  information  from  ESSA-derived  information  as-well-as  non-ESSA-derived sources.  In  cases  where  ESSA-derived  information  is  cited  in  this  report,  it  must  be properly  labeled  as  “ESSA-derived”  information  and  adhere  to  other  handling requirements identified in sections 2.3, 3.2 and 3.3 of this instruction. 2.4.2.  ESSA  Transcripts.  There are two types of transcripts, sanitized and un-sanitized. A transcript  can  be  part  or  all  of  a  verbatim  reproduction  of  an  assessed  communication  and may include certain identifying information (sanitized vs. un-sanitized). It may also contain transcriber’s  comments  or  remarks  to  clarify  or  enhance  understanding  of  the  information presented. 2.4.2.1.  Sanitized  transcripts are  furnished upon  request  of an organization. A sanitized transcript is a true representation of a communication, but will not contain PII, including sensitive  PII,  or  information  that  could  reasonably  identify  individuals  (names,  ranks, 22 AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 specific duty positions, etc.).  (T-1). Sanitized transcripts are typically requested when a report reveals critical information disclosures that do not meet the criteria from sections 2.3. or 3.2.1. through 3.2.6 of this instruction. transcripts  are true  and  complete representation  of  a 2.4.2.2.  Un-sanitized communication(s).  They  are  generated  whenever  criteria  are  met  from  sections  2.3  (as defined by the 67 CW/CC) or 3.2.1 through 3.2.5 of this instruction.  When the criteria in any of paragraphs 3.2.1 through 3.2.5 are met, un-sanitized transcript may be attached to or  included  in  other  reports  to  streamline  notifications  when  possible.    An  organization may  request  an  un-sanitized  transcript  if  they  believe  the  communication  meets  the criteria  in  paragraph  3.3.  An  un-sanitized  transcript  includes  both  the  sending  and receiving  communicator’s information  (if available).  This  type of transcript is  the final product of the attribution process described in section 3.3 of this instruction. 2.4.2.3.  Transcripts.    Classify  all  transcripts  (sanitized  or  un-sanitized)  according  to content.    All  markings  for  both  classified  and  unclassified  transcripts  must  be  IAW DODM 5200.01, Volumes 2 and 4, Information Security Program; Marking and Control Unclassified Information.  (T-1). AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 23 Chapter 3 ESSA ATTRIBUTION AND UNIQUE REPORTING 3.1.  Release  of  ESSA  Information.  Identifying  information  may  be  released  as  provided  in Paragraph  3.2  of  this  instruction.    In  all  other  cases,  do  not  release  information  that  could reasonably  identify  individuals  in  assessed  offices,  flights,  or  sections,  such  as  titles,  names, ranks,  complete  phone  numbers,  complete  e-mail  addresses,  etc.    Office  symbols  may  be released  if  the  release  of  the  office  symbol  does  not  provide  sufficient  data  to  identify  an individual.  At a minimum, include the three letter office of the offending organization.  As long as  the  information  in  a  product  does  not  identify  specific  individuals  as  the  source  of  the disclosure, a product may contain names, titles, or ranks when it is an integral part of the possible disclosure. 3.2.  Use  and  Control  of  ESSA  Products;  Situational  Guidance.  This  section  describes  the use and control of ESSA products.  It also contains specific situational guidance. 3.2.1.  Emergency  Situations.  This  section  will  apply  if  information  threatening  death, serious bodily harm, significant or intentional compromise of classified information, or major loss of property is obtained during an ESSA assessment.  (T-3). 3.2.1.1.  Immediately report this information, as appropriate, to the military commander, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), US law enforcement agency having jurisdiction  of  the  effected  organization,  or  other  agency  as  necessary  to  resolve  the emergency. 3.2.1.2.  Use the most expeditious means of reporting that provides full security. 3.2.1.3.  Complete identifying data may be released. 3.2.1.4.  This is not ESSA information; therefore, this data does not appear in any ESSA product. 3.2.1.5.  Immediate  action  may  be  taken  by  appropriate  authorities  to  address  the emergency situation. 3.2.1.6.  Until properly reported, the emergency situation has priority. Resources may be re-assigned and other assessment missions may be suspended or delayed as necessary. 3.2.1.7.  Within 24 hours of initial reporting, notify 67 CW/JA by message. 3.2.2.  Criminal, Foreign Intelligence, and Counterintelligence Information.  Information incidentally  acquired  during  ESSA  activities  that  directly  relates  to  criminal,  foreign intelligence, and counterintelligence information will be reported as follows: (T-1): 3.2.2.1.  Immediately report this information to the unit commander and AFOSI. 3.2.2.2.  Complete identifying data may be released. 3.2.2.3.  Although derived from ESSA activity, this data is not be included in any ESSA product. 24 AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 3.2.2.4.  Within  24 hours of initial  reporting, notify 67 CW/JA by message.  67 CW/JA will  promptly  provide  a  legal  review  of  the  report  to  be  forwarded  via  command  JA channels to AF/JAO and SAF/GCI.  (T-1).  3.2.3.  Classified  Information.  This  paragraph  will  apply  for  reporting  purposes  only.    If information  revealing  a  compromise  or  continuing  threat  of  a  compromise  of  classified information is obtained during the assessment, follow the reporting guidance within AFI 31-401,  Information  Security  Program  Management.   If  found  within  an  assessed communication also: 3.2.3.1.  Release only the minimum amount of data necessary to ensure prompt remedial action. Within the report briefly, summarize what was sent and its classification. 3.2.3.2.  If  an  attachment  is  present,  it  may  also  be  sent  using  secure  means  to  the appropriate  information  protection  office,  OPSEC  PM  for  evaluation.    The  information protection office is the first level of management for classified information. 3.2.3.3.  Release  full  header  information  (to,  from  and  cc  lines  or  sending/receiving addresses; dates/times; and subject  line) or account  information  (enclave,  username  and password)  to  the  appropriate  commander,  network  control  officials,  information protection  office,  OPSEC  PM  to  facilitate  the  positive  identification,  containment,  and remediation of compromised data or account from the network or information system. 3.2.4.  DV  Movements.  The  following  information,  if  encountered  during  an  assessment, must  be  properly  reported  IAW  AFI  71-101,  Volume  2,  Protective  Service  Matters,  and included in an ESSA product: 3.2.4.1.  High-level DV movements, such as the President, Vice President, foreign heads of state or foreign ambassadors.  Reportable data also includes information pertaining to specific  dangerous  situations  and/or  a  threat,  plan,  or  attempt  to  physically  harm  or kidnap  certain  individuals,  as  described  in  AFI  71-101V2,  Attachment  3.    Report  this information to the local AFOSI detachment of the CDA unit conducting the assessment, who  in-turn  reports  this  information  to  the  local  AFOSI  detachment  at  the  assessed location. 3.2.4.2.  Derivatively  classify  products  utilizing  the  applicable  security  classification guide or source document. Specific itineraries may carry a higher classification based on trip  sensitivity.  For  information  regarding  classification,  guides  contact  the  information protection office. 3.2.5.  Vulnerabilities  to  Unclassified  Government  Owned/Leased  Networks  and/or Databases.    If  vulnerabilities  to  unclassified  government  owned  or  leased  networks  or databases  are  discovered  in  the  course  of  an  ESSA  assessment,  immediately  release  full header  information  (to,  from  and  cc  lines  or  sending/receiving  addresses;  dates/  times;  and subject line) to the appropriate commander, network control officials, information protection offices, OPSEC PM to facilitate the positive identification, containment, and remediation of compromised  data  or  account  from  the  network  or  information  system.  Vulnerabilities  are defined as a release of user credentials  of government owned or operated systems,  network topology  data,  compromises  of  PII,  or  other  information  that  may  allow  an  adversary  to attack or exploit AF networks.   EXCEPTION:    Communications to and from various help AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 25 desks or Cybersecurity offices to report and resolve network or systems issues are not to be reported.  3.2.6.  Reportable Breach of PII.  Breaches of PII must be reported as directed in AFI 33-332,  The  Air  Force  Privacy  Program  and  Civil  Liberties  Program,  paragraph  9.3.    A reportable  breach  is  identifying  information  specific  to  an  individual  that  has  been  sent unencrypted from or to an AFIN account to or from a commercial server in violation of AF policy.    In  such  cases,  report  the  names  of  all  parties  involved  in  the  potential  breach,  the facts, and the circumstances around the potential breach to the appropriate HHQ Privacy Act PM, OPSEC PM Office, and/or US-CERT, as the situation requires. 3.2.7.  Commanders  seeking  an  unsanitized  transcript  which  does  not  fall  within  the parameters above may request one from 67 CW/CC, with a copy to 67JA.  The request must explain the need for the unsanitized product, including how the proposed use would fit within the limitations of NTISSD 600 and DODI 8560.01, COMSEC Monitoring and IA Readiness Testing, paragraph 4.1.  The 67CW/ JA in consultation with 24AF/JA will review the request and unsanitized ESSA product and they will make a recommendation to 67 CW/CC whether the request is consistent with the NTISSD and the DODI.  If 67 CW/CC recommends release of  the  transcript,  the  analysis  and  his  recommendation  will  be  forwarded  to  SAF/GC  via AFSPC/A3 and JA, for SAF/GC  approval.    (T-3).  Except  as provided in paragraph 3.2, of this  instruction  unsanitized  ESSA  transcripts  may  not  be  released  without  approval  from SAF/GC. 3.3.  Assessment  Preparation.  When  CDA  teams  conducting  ESSA  missions  are  unable  to conduct an assessment via remote operations the CDA teams may need to deploy to the tasked assessed  location.    The  CDA  team  may  require  assistance  from  the  assessed  organization  well before the actual start date of the ESSA assessment mission.  The assessed organizations OPSEC PM  will  interface  with  the  CDA  team  conducting  the  ESSA  mission  and  other  base  agencies.  (T-2).  The following are typical actions needed to prepare for an assessment: 3.3.1.  Gain familiarity with ESSA objectives and methods. 3.3.2.  Ensure senior leadership is advised of ESSA activities. 3.3.3.  Provide security classification guides.  3.3.4.  Upon request, provide operational orders, phone books, plans, operating instructions, or other mission related documents. 3.3.5.  For telephone monitoring,  generate an initial  list  of phone numbers, along  with  their associated flight, office, division symbol or abbreviation to be assessed (approximately 125-200).  Use sound judgment in the creation of the list. Functions, flights, offices, or sections should  be  considered  for  assessment  based  on  roles  or  contribution  to  the  mission  or operation.    Medical  facilities,  legal  and  defense  counsel  offices,  and  chapels/chaplains  will not be selected for assessment.  (T-0). 3.3.6.  Determine  SIPRNET  product  distribution  listing  (who),  product  delivery  time  and frequency (when/how often), and pass to the assessment team. 3.4.  Team Travel and Funding.  When teams are unable to conduct ESSA missions via remote operations,  the  teams  may  need  to  deploy  to  the  assessed  location.    If  the  CDA  team  has  to conduct an ESSA mission at the assessed organization’s location due to lack of technology, it is 26 AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 the responsibility of the CDA unit to fund the CDA team’s travel.  If the assessed organization requests an ESSA mission on location, it is the responsibility of the assessed organization to fund the travel of the CDA assessment team.  (Note: The 624 OC determines if a lack of technology is responsible for team deployment.  The assessed unit may appeal to 67 CW/CC or AFSPC/CC if they disagree with the 624 OC’s decision.)  The following are specific to an on-site assessment, and supplement the actions listed above: 3.4.1.  Coordinate a work area and secure storage facility for the CDA team performing the ESSA mission. 3.4.2.  Assist the team with arrangements for billeting, transportation, and messing. 3.4.3.  Provide necessary technical information when requested, such as frequencies, system specifications, circuit listings, and critical nodes. 3.4.4.  Ensure  administrative  communication  capabilities  are  available  to  teams  for operational  or  administrative  support.    Arrange  specialized  communications  support  as needed to meet mission requirements. 3.5.  Quality Control (QC).  QC is an integral part of accomplishing and managing the mission and is necessary to ensure all aspects of ESSA operations are the most professional possible.  QC checks  identify  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  training  processes,  ensures  customers  receive professional and quality products, and serves as a feedback tool through trends analysis to share training strengths and correct training deficiencies.  AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 27 Chapter 4 NOTICE AND CONSENT PROCEDURES 4.1.  Notification.  Users of DOD electronic communications devices  are  to  be notified the use of those devices constitutes consent to monitoring.

The  signed forms  will  be  retained  by  the  organizational  Cybersecurity  office  or  designated representative until six months after the user no longer requires access to the system.  (T-0). 4.5.2.3.  If  the  system  is  not  capable  of  complying  with  paragraph  4.5.2.1,  a  DD  Form 2056 must be affixed on all computer monitors and video display screens. 4.6.  Private or Intranet Web Home pages.  Prominently display the exact notice and consent banner specified in Attachment 2 of this instruction on the first page of all private and intranet web home pages (to include SharePoint sites); the banner is  not required  on subsequent  pages. Hyperlinks  to  the  notice  and  consent  statement  do  not  meet  the  requirement  as  it  pertains  to private/intranet  web  pages.    Banner  pop-ups  are  authorized  ONLY  when  access  to  the  page requires  the  user  to  press  a  key/button,  thereby  demonstrating  acceptance  of  the  banner provisions. 4.6.1.  Notice and consent requirements do not apply to public web pages. 4.6.2.  Applications.  The DOD Banner/User Agreement policy memorandum only applies to DOD information systems, not applications.  If an information system is configured such that first  access  is  through  an  application,  then  the  notice  and  consent  banner  is  required  or  the information system will need to be configured to present the notice and consent banner prior to accessing any applications. 4.7.  Portable  Electronic  Devices  (PED).  A  PED  is  any  non-stationary  electronic  apparatus with  the  capability  of  recording,  storing,  and/or  transmitting  information  (e.g.  text  pagers,  cell phones, smartphones, tablets, satellite phones, and hand-held radios/land mobile radios (LMRs)).  Refer to AFMAN 33-282, for more information on PEDs.  These devices, excluding LMRs and PEDs  identified  in  paragraph  4.7.1.1  of  this  instruction,  must  comply  with  the  requirements  in paragraph 4.5 of this instruction to the extent technically possible.. 4.7.1.  All  PED  users  must  sign  an  AF  Form  4433,  US  Air  Force  Unclassified  Wireless Mobile Devise  User Agreement.   LMR users are exempt from  this requirement if the  LMR has a DD Form 2056 attached to it.  The signed form will be retained by the organizational AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 29 Cybersecurity  office  or  designated  representative  for  a  minimum  of  six  months  after  the device has been returned to the issuing office.  (T-1).  4.7.2.  PEDs  and  LMRs  that  cannot  display  the  abbreviated  Notice  and  Consent  banner requirement  must  have  a  DD  Form  2506  attached,  unless  the  organization  commander  has Force Protection and/or OPSEC concerns based on the local operating environment IAW AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC), or unless the PED/LMR is too small to accommodate a DD Form 2506.  Small locally generated DD Forms 2056 are authorized if necessary to fit on a PED or LMR.  If Force Protection/OPSEC concerns preclude use of a DD Form 2506, then members issued an LMR must sign and AF Form 4433.  4.8.  Other Information Technology.  Any telecommunication devices not otherwise referenced in this chapter must have a signed AF Form 4433 or AF Form 4394 on file.  The signed forms will be retained by the Organizational Cybersecurity office or the designated representative for a minimum of six months after the device has been returned to the issuing office.  (T-1). 4.9.  Optional  Notice  and  Consent  Awareness  Methods.  Optional  methods  are  not  to  be included in  notice and consent  packages.

Correspondence  from  the  base  or  facility  commander,  addressing  notice  and  consent provisions, to all assigned organizations for dissemination to unit personnel. 4.9.2.  Addressing  notice  and  consent  provisions  to  newcomers  during  in-processing, periodic OPSEC awareness briefings, and commander’s calls. 4.9.3.  Using  base  bulletins,  base  newspapers,  E-mails,  web  pages,  and  similar  publications on a periodic basis. 4.9.4.  Incorporating  notice  and  consent  provisions  in  operating  procedures,  instructions, information  system  security  rules  of  behavior  or  acceptable  use  guidance,  etc.,  that  are periodically reviewed by users. 4.9.5.  Any  other  actions  deemed  appropriate  by  the  base  or  facility  commander  or  the commander’s  designee  to  make  sure  DOD  electronic  communications  systems  users  are aware that using these systems and devices constitutes consent to electronic communications monitoring. 4.10.  Notice  and  Consent  Certification  Process.  This  section  describes  the  biennial certification,  by  SAF/GC,  that  users  of  AF  electronic  communication  systems  are  provided legally  sufficient  notice  that  use  of  those  systems  constitutes  consent  to  monitoring  for  all authorized purposes. This process ensures SAF/GC reviews and provides written approval of Air Force  electronic  communications  monitoring  and  cybersecurity  readiness  testing  procedures, training  processes,  and  user  notification  procedures  on  a  biennial  basis,  as  mandated  by  DODI 8560.01. 4.10.1.  HQ AFSPC/A2/3/6, initiates the Biennial Notification Process by sending out a task message to the MAJCOM, DRU, and FOAs with the certification schedule. 30 AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 4.10.2.  24 AF will release annual Cyberspace Tasking Orders (CTO) mandating compliance with the use of Department of Defense (DOD) Standard Notice and Consent Banner and User Agreement statements.  (T-1). 4.10.3.  The  Wing  Cybersecurity  office  will  at  a  minimum,  complete  and  document  the actions outlined in this instruction.  (T-1).  4.10.3.1.  Prepare  a  detailed  summary  of  the  previous  24-month  notice  and  consent actions  following  standards  described  in  this  guidance.    The  Wing  Cybersecurity  office sends  this  summary  to  the  installation  SJA  by  15  April  of  each  even-numbered  fiscal year.  The template for the summary letter is provided in Attachment 4 of this instruction. 4.10.3.1.1.  The  Notice  and  Consent  Checklist  Attachment  5,  is  provided  to  assist with  completing  the  notice  and  consent  summary  package  and  determining  which attachments are required to be included. 4.10.3.1.2.  The  Wing  Cybersecurity  office  should  ensure  FOA,  DRU,  GSU,  and tenant  packages  are  in  compliance  before  host  package  is  submitted.    Note  that attachments and summary letters for FOAs, DRUs, GSUs, and tenants should not be included in the package. List all GSU, FOA, DRU, and other tenants in paragraph #1 of the Notice and Consent Memorandum. 4.10.3.1.3.  Only submit summary packages electronically as a single PDF document with either “wet” ink or digital common access card (CAC) enabled signatures for all required endorsements. 4.10.3.2.  Summary letters covering more than one physical installation (example: remote Air  Base  as  a  GSU)  must  clearly  identify  each  installation  in  paragraph  1  of  this instruction.  FOAs, DRUs, and tenants will be addressed per the following:  (T-1).  4.10.3.2.1.  FOAs  and  DRUs  located  on  a  host  base  report  their  notice  and  consent compliance through the host Wing Cybersecurity office. 4.10.3.2.2.  FOAs  and  DRUs  not  located  on  a  host  base  report  their  notice  and consent compliance as a Wing Cybersecurity office. 4.10.3.2.3.  All  other  tenant  wings  or  organizations  report  their  notice  and  consent compliance through the host installation Wing Cybersecurity office. 4.10.4.  The Installation SJA reviews the summary and attached documentation and provides written review (see Attachment 4 of this instruction for SJA 1st endorsement format).  This SJA  review  should  ensure  the  actions  taken  are  sufficient  to  establish  compliance  with  the requirements  of  this  instruction.    The  summary  and  its  attachments  should  clearly demonstrate users of DOD electronic communication or information systems know such use constitutes  consent  to  monitoring.    If  the  SJA  determines  the  documentation  is  deficient  in any of the requirements, the package will be returned for corrective action.  If the package is determined to be legally sufficient, the Wing Cybersecurity office includes the SJA’s written determination  as  part  of  the  certification  package.    Upon  endorsement,  the  installation  SJA will  forward  the  summary  back  to  the  Wing  Cybersecurity  office  for  their  tracking  and submission to the MAJCOM or DRU SJA for endorsement.  Final submissions to MAJCOM and DRU SJA must occur NLT 1 May of each even-numbered fiscal year. AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 31 4.10.5.  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA  /A6,  in  coordination  with  HQ  AFSPC/A2/3/6,  ensures subordinate bases and installations adhere to established procedures and timelines within this guidance  as  well  as  respond  to  all  summary  report  requests  for  correction  or  clarification within 14 duty days. 4.10.5.1.  Validates  bases/wing/FOA/tenant  units  identified  in  the  precious  SAF/GC certification memo are correct, providing updates to AFSPC/A2/3/6 as needed. 4.10.5.2.  Ensures  AFSPC/A2/3/6  has  current  contacts  for  each  Wing  Cybersecurity office. 4.10.6.  MAJCOM/DRU/FOA/ SJA reviews the summary, attached documentation for legal compliance,  and  provides  a  written  review  (see  Attachment  4  of  this  instruction  for MAJCOM  SJA  2nd  endorsement  format).    If  the  MAJCOM  SJA  determines  the documentation  is  deficient  in  any  of  the  requirements,  the  package  will  be  returned  to  the Wing Cybersecurity office for corrective action.   If the package is  determined to  be legally sufficient,  the  MAJCOM  SJA’s  written  determination  becomes  part  of  the  certification package.  The MAJCOM SJA returns the package to the Wing Cybersecurity office. 4.10.7.  Following host base wing or communications commander signature, installation SJA endorsement and MAJCOM or DRU/SJA endorsement, the Wing Cybersecurity office sends the  installation  summary  package,  with  supporting  documentation,  as  a  single  PDF  file  for review  to  HQ  AFSPC/A2/3/6  no  later  than  15  May  of  each  even-numbered  fiscal  year.  Additionally,  Wing  Cybersecurity  office  will  send  an  informational  copy  of  only  the summary letter to the MAJCOM and DRU/A6.  (T-2). 4.10.8.  HQ  AFSPC/JA  ensures  all  AF  facilities  submit  inputs  in  order  to  receive  biennial certification  according  to  Table  4.1,  Notice  and  Consent  Certification  Schedule.  HQ AFSPC/A2/3/6  reviews  all  summary  packages  for  required  content  and  correct  format. Packages  requiring  corrections  and/or  clarifications  are  returned  to  the  responsible  Wing Cybersecurity office. Packages that are determined to be complete and in the correct format are forwarded to HQ AFSPC/JA for final endorsement before submission to SAF/GC. 4.10.9.  Any  deficiencies  noted  by  HQ  AFSPC/JA  are  returned  to  the  responsible  Wing Cybersecurity  office  for  correction.    When  necessary  for  compliance,  coordination  through the  MAJCOM  Cybersecurity  office  is  required  to  ensure  installation  Wing  Cybersecurity offices  understand  and  accomplish  necessary  correction  actions.    Once  corrected,  HQ AFSPC/JA will endorse  all summary  packages and submit electronically  to  SAF/GC  by 15 July of each even-numbered fiscal year.  (T-1). 4.10.10.  SAF/GC  certifies  that  there  has  been  sufficient  notice  that  the  use  of  DOD electronic communication systems constitutes consent to monitoring.  If SAF/GC determines the summary package contains insufficient evidence to establish full compliance with notice of  monitoring  requirements,  the  summary  is  returned  for  further  corrective  action  prior  to certification. Once all base summary reports contain legally sufficient actions for notice and consent, SAF/GC returns a certification listing to HQ AFSPC/A2/3/6 by 1 September of each even-numbered  fiscal  year  listing  all  installations  approved  for  authorized  monitoring activities.  Upon receipt of the certification listing, HQ AFSPC/A2/3/6 forward copies to an authorized monitoring agency as prescribed by DODI 8560.01.

By  signing  this  document  you  acknowledge  and  consent  that  when  you  access Department of Defense (DOD) information systems: A3.2.  You  are  accessing  a  U.  S.  Government  (USG)  information  system  (IS)  (which includes  any  device  attached  to  this  information  system)  that  is  provided  for  U.S.  Government authorized use only. A3.3.  You consent to the following conditions: A3.4.  The  U.  S.  Government  routinely  intercepts  and  monitors  communications  on  this information  system  for  purposes testing, communications  security  (COMSEC)  monitoring,  network  operations  and  defense,  personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations. including,  but  not limited to,  penetration A3.5.  At  any  time,  the  U.  S.  Government  may  inspect  and  seize  data  stored  on  this information  system.  Communications  using,  or  data  stored  on,  this  information  system  are  not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any U.S. Government-authorized purpose. A3.6.  This  information  system  includes  security  measures  (e.g.,  authentication  and  access controls) to protect U.S. Government interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy. A3.7.  Notwithstanding the above, using an information system does not constitute consent to personnel  misconduct,  law  enforcement,  or  counterintelligence  investigative  searching  or monitoring of the content of privileged communications or data (including work product) that are related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants.  Under  these  circumstances,  such  communications  and  work  product  are  private  and confidential, as further explained below: A3.8.  Nothing in this User Agreement shall be interpreted to limit the user's consent to, or in any  other  way  restrict  or  affect,  any  U.S.  Government  actions  for  purposes  of  network administration, operation, protection, or defense,  or for communications security. This  includes all communications. A3.9.  The  user  consents  to  interception/capture  and  seizure  of  ALL  communications  and data  for  any  authorized  purpose  (including  personnel  misconduct,  law  enforcement,  or counterintelligence  investigation).  However,  consent  to  interception/capture  or  seizure  of communications  and  data  is  not  consent  to  the  use  of  privileged  communications  or  data  for personnel  misconduct,  law  enforcement,  or  counterintelligence  investigation  against  any  party and does not negate any applicable privilege or confidentiality that otherwise applies. A3.10.  Whether  any  particular  communication  or  data  qualifies  for  the  protection  of  a privilege, or is covered by a duty of confidentiality, is determined in accordance with established legal standards and DOD direction. Users are strongly encouraged to seek personal legal counsel on such matters prior to using an information system if the user intends to rely on the protections of a privilege or confidentiality. AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 41 A3.11.  Users should take reasonable steps to identify such communications or data that the user  asserts  are  protected  by  any  such  privilege  or  confidentiality.  However,  the  user's identification  or  assertion  of  a  privilege  or  confidentiality  is  not  sufficient  to  create  such protection where none exists under established legal standards and DOD policy direction. A3.12.  A  user's  failure  to  take  reasonable  steps  to  identify  such  communications  or  data  as privileged  or  confidential  does  not  waive  the  privilege  or  confidentiality  if  such  protections otherwise exist under established legal standards and DOD direction. However, in such cases, the U.S. Government is authorized to take reasonable actions to identify such communication or data as being subject to a privilege or confidentiality, and such actions do not negate any applicable privilege or confidentiality. A3.13.  These conditions preserve the confidentiality of the communication or data, and the legal  protections  regarding  the  use  and  disclosure  of  privileged  information,  and  thus  such communications and data are private and  confidential. Further, the U.S.  Government  shall take all reasonable measures to protect the content of captured/seized privileged communications and data to ensure they are appropriately protected. A3.14.  In  cases  when  the  user  has  consented  to  content  searching  or  monitoring  of communications  or  data  for  personnel  misconduct,  law  enforcement,  or  counterintelligence investigative  searching,  (i.e.,  for  all  communications  and  data  other than  privileged communications  or  data  that  are  related  to  personal  representation  or  services  by  attorneys, psychotherapists,  or  clergy,  and  their  assistants),  the  U.S.  Government  may,  solely  at  its discretion and in accordance with DOD direction, elect to apply a privilege or other restriction on the U.S. Government's otherwise-authorized use or disclosure of such information. A3.15.  All  of  the  above  conditions  apply  regardless  of  whether  the  access  or  use  of  an Information  system  includes  the  display  of  a  Notice  and  Consent  Banner  ("banner").  When  a banner is used, the banner functions to remind the user of the conditions that are set forth in this user  agreement,  regardless  of  whether  the  banner  describes  these  conditions  in  full  detail  or provides  a  summary  of  such  conditions,  and  regardless  of  whether  the  banner  expressly references this user agreement.  42 AFI10-712  17 DECEMBER 2015 NOTICE AND CONSENT MEMORANDUM WITH 1ST AND 2ND IND Attachment 4 Figure A4.1.
