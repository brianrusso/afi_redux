         MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs MEMORANDUM FOR  DISTRIBUTION C   FROM:  HQ USAF/A4    SUBJECT:  Air Force Guidance Memorandum 2017-01 to AFI 31-105, Air Force Corrections System    1030 Air Force Pentagon   Washington, DC  20330-1420 By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this in an Air Force Guidance Memorandum immediately changing AFI 31-105, Air Force Corrections System. Compliance with this Memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.  All waiver requests from complying with requirements from Air Force policy must be submitted through the chain of command to the OPR, AF/A4S, for due consideration.  Current guidance in AFI 31-105 remains in effect with the following changes:     AFI31-105_AFGM2017-01 28 JUNE 2017   Attachment 19 Added to Table of Contents: Attachment 19, LIMITING THE USE OF RESTRICTIVE HOUSING Change paragraph 1.2.2.2. to read: Support Agreements (SA), Contracts, and Memorandums of Agreement (MOA). Any circumstance that would cause an anticipated incarceration at a location other than the parent installation necessitates a written SA (with a Federal or DoD entity); contract (with a non-federal government or a civilian entity); or MOA under the authority of 10 USC 956 and DoDD 1325.04. (See DoDI 4000.19, Support Agreements, 25 Apr 2013, for additional information.) (T-0) Reasons for an installation to have a SA/contract/MOA in effect include, but are not limited to, the lack of an organic correctional facility; natural disaster preparedness should organic facility become unusable; or lack of bed space (temporary high population, gender mix of the confinees, special needs of the confinee, etc.). Coordinate emergency and unusual circumstances that would preclude the ability to properly execute a SA/contract/MOA with Air Force Security Forces Center, Confinement and Corrections Directorate (AFSFC/FC), for assistance. If possible, AFSFC/FC assists in placement and transfer of confinees not covered by existing SA, contract, or MOA. The parent installation still retains responsibility to secure appropriate facilities via SA, contract, or MOA. When       desiring to establish a SA with a sister Service facility, route through AFSFC/FC, who in-turn pre-coordinates with that Service's Correctional HQs. (T-1) Change paragraph to read 1.3.12.: The DFC appoints a commissioned officer, in writing, as the confinement officer. This position is usually the unit Operations Officer/S3. DFC may appoint a DAF civilian GS-0083-11 or higher if AD SF officer manpower is absent or very limited. Confinement NCO (no lower than an E-4) is operationally responsible to the confinement officer. (T-1) Change paragraph 2.4.1. to read: Staff members who do not possess a high degree of maturity and emotional stability are generally unsuccessful in a corrections environment. The DFC is highly encouraged not to assign staff members who are less than an E-4 and do not hold a 5-skill level. DFC may assign DAF civilian GS-0083-5 or higher to subordinate or leadership positions in the facility, using the same training requirements as required for AD staff. Consult with Civilian Personnel Office as necessary before assigning. (T-1) Change paragraph 2.6.1.2. to read: Units design staff training programs unique to their confinement situation (organic or non-organic facility) to ensure all personnel assigned duties associated with confinement are fully trained. As a minimum include training and subsequent critical duty STAN-EVALS for staff assigned to a facility on: custody, escort procedures, proper use of restraining devices, suicide prevention, administrative management, VWAP, management/observation/administration of medication calls, sex offender registration/notification requirements, sexual abuse prevention/detection/reporting with PREA, Restrictive Housing (RH) policies IAW the Department of Justice (DoJ) and DoD guidance regarding juveniles and RH timelines contained in this instruction. Ensure training is current in safety, Self-Aid/Buddy Care, Adult CPR, and use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED). (T-1) Change paragraph 2.6.2. to read: Initial and recurring corrections staff training programs. Units with organic facilities complete paragraphs 2.6.2.1. to 2.6.2.22., as a minimum. Units without an organic facility complete paragraphs 2.6.2.3. to 2.6.2.18., as a minimum. DoD and Federal confinement/corrections standards require refresher training be accomplished at least every two years, however, passing a confinement STAN-EVAL resets the two year time requirement. (T-0) Paragraph 2.6.2.19. added: Special Quarters. Staff should know and understand the types of special quarters and their requirements contained in this instruction. (T-0) Paragraph 2.6.2.20. added: Restrictive Housing (RH) policies. National correctional reform efforts gave rise to the publication of a Restrictive Housing Report and Recommendations. This report set forth policy recommendations for the DoJ Federal correctional system, as well as guiding principles for all US correctional agencies. In turn, this resulted in a Presidential Memorandum for limiting the use of RH in the federal government. The memorandum directed implementation of the policy recommendations contained in the Report concerning use of RH within the Federal Government. The     guidance provided in this instruction implements the DoJ “guiding principles” (as detailed in Attachment 19) within the AFCS regarding juveniles and RH timelines. (T-0) Paragraph 2.6.2.21. added: Complete confinement staff training on signs of Mental Health Decompensation/deterioration based on reliable scientific evidence per the DoJ’s guiding principles and ensure training is documented. (T-0) Use AFSFC SMARTNet to review the training concerning Mental Health Decompensation/deterioration. Since every situation can present unique challenges consult with a qualified military medical/MH provider for questions/concerns. (T-1) Paragraph 2.6.2.22. added: Complete confinement staff training on Young Brain Development and Appropriate De-escalation Tactics based on reliable scientific evidence per the DoJ’s guiding principles and ensure training is documented. (T-0) Use AFSFC SMARTNet to review the training concerning Young Brain Development and Appropriate De-escalation tactics. Since every situation can present unique challenges consult with a qualified military medical/MH provider for questions/concerns. (T-1) Change paragraph 3.1.4.1. to read: The examining medical officer (doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician’s assistant) documents medical history, validates the member's current list of medication needed during confinement, as well as the presence of cuts, bruises, or unusual marks, etc., on Standard Form (SF) 600, Chronological Record of Medical Care or computer generated equivalent. Additionally, the examining medical officer tests for communicable diseases, including HIV (see paragraph 2.8.2), Tuberculosis (TB), Hepatitis B and C, and conducts urinalysis screening for illegal drug and narcotics use. For female confinees, administer a pregnancy test with the results annotated in her SF 600 or computer generated equivalent. The medical staff ensures all tested results are immediately provided to the appropriate military CF commander/officer/NCO (or civilian jail administrator) so the confinement staff may take appropriate health measures and take precautions for bio hazard actions for spilled bodily fluids and other safety considerations. Further, the examining medical officer completes a visual inspection of all body cavities to prevent the introduction of contraband into the facility. If there is probable cause for the introduction of contraband (beyond a frisk search and personal property search – see paragraphs 2.6.2.12.3. and 8.5.2. for additional information on searching) the confinement officer or DFC notifies the examining medical officer to complete a cavity inspection (this does not preclude the medical officer from conducting a cavity inspection, without probably cause, if they deem it medically necessary). Included on the SF 600 is the examining medical officer’s assessment of confinee's ability to self-medicate while in the confinement facility. Finally, the examining medical officer determines the confinee’s "fitness" for confinement recommendation on DD Form 2707, Confinement Order, which is filed in the confinees CTF. Mental and physical conditions are immediately discussed between the examining medical officer and confinement officer or NCO so that appropriate safeguards can be implemented, if necessary. (T-0) Change paragraph 3.1.4.2. to read: If the confinee displays irrational or inappropriate behavior which is symptomatic of mental disturbance or Serious Mental Illness (SMI),     consult a medical or mental health practitioner immediately for disposition. If the confinee displays the effects of hallucinatory substance, place the confinee in appropriate medical/mental health facility until such time as they are detoxified and medically/mentally certified “fit” for confinement. (T-1) Change paragraph 5.3. to read: In the AFCS, a confinee’s status is immediately determined as either pretrial or post-trial. (T-0) Change paragraph 5.4. to read: This is a method of calculation to categorize a confinee’s risk for violence, non-compliance, self-harm, or escape. (T-0) This risk is not “static” and can “fluctuate” depending upon the confinee’s individual thought processing of circumstances, e.g., social, mental, physical, or their legal circumstances, etc. Therefore caution should be used to ensure the CF staff’s classifications are current via the observed and perceived intent of the confinee and reviewed when appropriate. Classification actions should be done with the understanding that causal (by cause) influences could come from either inside or outside of the facility. Upon placement into confinement a period of observation by the staff is necessary to ensure the confinee has acclimated to their new situation and surroundings. This is true for pretrial detainees and newly adjudged post-trial inmates including any confinee who is a newly arrived transfer. This time is known as the acclimation period and is further explained in paragraph 5.4.5. for pretrial detainees, paragraph 5.4.6. for post-trial inmates and paragraph 5.4.7. for newly arrived transferred confinees. Immediately following the acclimation period, the staff completes the confinee’s initial custody classification. NOTE: Refer to Table 8.2 in Chapter 8 for more information on custody requirements. Paragraph 5.4.5. added:  Pretrial detainees are immediately classified as maximum custody for 72 hours or first duty day (whichever is later). This time is their acclimation period. (T-1) Paragraph 5.4.5.1. added:  Upon incarceration of the pretrial detainee, schedule a MH evaluation to be conducted as soon as possible following the end of the acclimation period. Within 24 hours following completion of the acclimation period use DoDI 1325.07, Appendix 1 to Enclosure 2, Offense Severity Scale, to produce the severity points to determine the custody classification as either medium or maximum (the DD Form 2711, Mar 2013 version in block 7, incorrectly reads “medium-in” when it should read “medium”). In making the confinee’s appropriate custody classification all facts and circumstances are to be considered, including, but not limited to: the alleged offenses, history of violence and prior criminal history, history of escape and flight risk, outstanding detainers or warrants, institutional disciplinary history (if applicable), substance abuse, stability factors (e.g. age, employment, residence, family ties), as well as physical and any previous mental health evaluation(s). Once the MH report is received, the CF staff considers all available data/observations/MH report(s) and then reviews the initial custody classification to prepare the DD Form 2711-1, Mar 2013, Custody Reclassification, with the goal being to have the reclassification review accomplished by the first duty following receipt of the MH report. When pretrial detainees reclassify to a reduced risk classification, the DFC notifies the SJA and the commander who ordered the pretrial confinement. (T-1) When in-processing pretrial detainees, ensure documentation of the DD Form 2710, Prisoner Background Summary, is completed unless one is already on file. The DFC documents the decision and reasons in the confinee’s CTF. (T-0) The MH evaluation report is a medical treatment necessity as well as a useful tool for classifications thus needs to be delivered to the DFC as soon as possible. (T-1) NOTE: During the acclimation period be keenly aware to observe behavior of the pretrial detainee for indicators of risk, especially those who have the potential to receive lengthy sentences. Often a sense of desperation (suicide/escape) or violent outbursts can develop. Paragraph 5.4.5.2. added: Do not co-mingle maximum custody pretrial detainees with other confinees. (T-1) Paragraph 5.4.6.: Post-trial inmates, are classified as maximum custody for 72 hours or first duty day (whichever is later). This time is their acclimation period. Within 24 hours following completion of the acclimation period use DD Form 2711 (the DD Form 2711, Mar 2013 version in block 7, incorrectly reads “medium-in” when it should read “medium”) to determine the confinee’s custody classification and schedule a MH evaluation to be conducted as soon as possible following the end of the acclimation period. When previously and continually held as a pretrial detainee the confinement officer considers accomplishing a new DD Form 2711 upon adjudication since a guilty finding and a sentence can effect behavior and create a new sense of desperation. (T-1) When in-processing post-trial inmates, ensure the DD Form 2710, Prisoner Background Summary, is completed unless one is already on file. (T-0) NOTE: During the acclimation period be keenly aware to observe behavior of the post-trial inmate for indicators of risk, especially those who have lengthy sentences. Often a sense of desperation (suicide/escape) or violent outbursts can develop. Paragraph 5.4.7. added: Newly arrived transferred confinees are classified as maximum custody for 72 hours or first duty day (whichever is later). This time is their acclimation period. Similar to MH evaluations for pre-and post-trial confinees schedule a MH evaluation unless one is on file. Use DD Form 2711-1 to determine possible custody reclassification. However for any transferred confinees the confinement officer may, using known previous data, e.g. incarceration history, etc., reduce acclimation period. (T-1) Change paragraph 5.5.2. to read: Co-mingling of officer and enlisted. Although the DoD no longer requires post-trial separation of former officers from former enlisted, Level I facility staffs may still face unique challenges. DFCs should consider the following issues when determining if separate quarters are advantageous for the mission: previously in the staff's chain-of-command, previous personal familiarity with the staff, and other interpersonal associations. Regardless of current pretrial rank or post-trial previous rank, confinees do not hold positions of authority nor supervise any confinees. Properly engaging and deciding these factors preserves the safety and security of the     facility, as well as limits any negative effects concerning the morale/welfare and good order/discipline of the installation. If a transfer is desired, contact AFSFC/FCT. (T-1) Change paragraph 5.5.4. to read: Special Quarters. For the purposes of widest understanding, the term special quarters refers generally to the categories of: Administrative Segregation (A-Seg), Disciplinary Segregation (D-Seg), or voluntary and involuntary Protective Custody (PC). Special quarters doesn’t equal Restrictive Housing (RH) unless the confinee is housed involving three basic elements (see Attachment 19 for RH definition). (T-0) NOTE: General Population commonly refers to those not housed in special quarters or RH. Paragraph 5.5.4.1. added: Administrative Segregation (commonly called “A-Seg”) is the term used to indicate separation from general population for acclimation or separation for a non-disciplinary situation. A-Seg requires the staff to annotate cell checks (not to exceed 15 minutes) as determined by confinement officer, on DD Form 503, Health Assessment Certification for Segregation. Annotate the DD Form 509, Inspection Record of Segregation or computer generated equivalent. (T-0) On the first subsequent duty day after expiration of the reason for A-Seg, the DFC, or SNCO or above designee in their absence, formally (face-to-face) advises the confinee of any decision and reasons to continue the confinee’s segregation beyond the initial reason as well as what measures the confinee needs to take to move out of A-Seg. The DFC documents the decision, reasons, and measures needed to move from A-Seg in the confinee’s CTF. (T-1) NOTE 1: See DoDI 1325.07, Enclosure 2, Paragraph 10 for additional medical requirements and segregation timeline requirements, as well as AFI 31-105, Attachment 19 for additional information on RH. NOTE 2: While in A-Seg, the confinement officer determines the type of cell furnishings (if any) to be removed for safety and security. NOTE 3: See Attachment 19 for additional information on RH. Paragraph 5.5.4.1.1. added: It is prudent to keep the use of these restrictions to a minimum, thus periodic case reviews are beneficial to the confinee and the facility. After the initial A-Seg is complete, confinees are afforded the same programs, i.e., work outlets and privileges (dayroom and recreation) as general population. It may be necessary to design a schedule to separately use the same resources. All confinees in A-Seg are afforded the same cell furnishings as those not segregated, after the initial A-Seg is complete. If housed in A-Seg, no matter the reason, results in the confinee locked down a vast majority of the day, typically 22-hours or more, see Attachment 19, Limiting the Use of Restrictive Housing. (T-1) NOTE 1: See DoDI 1325.07, Enclosure 2, Paragraph 10 for additional medical requirements and segregation timeline requirements, as well as AFI 31-105, Attachment 19 for additional information on RH. NOTE 2: The time period for this restriction should not normally exceed 30 days (contact AFSFC/FCT for resolution assistance and potential transfer options).     Paragraph  5.5.4.2. added: Disciplinary Segregation (commonly called “D-Seg”) is appropriate when the confinee’s presence in general population poses a danger to the confinee, staff, other confinees, or the public. It may be used immediately after a serious rules violation in which the confinement officer determines it is in the best interest of safety and facility operations while awaiting a formal D&A Bd hearing and/or as a result of a recommended disciplinary action from the D&A Bd. Ensure DD Form 2712, Prisoner Evaluation is used to document a violation of facility rules and policies. In making this determination, the DFC or designee considers and approves the use of D-Seg if the seriousness of the alleged offense(s) includes; if the offense(s) involved violence, attempted escape, posed a threat to facility safety by encouraging others to engage in such misconduct, or for preserving the integrity of the investigation and maintenance of good order and discipline. The confinement officer or designee determines when the temporary removal of furnishings is necessary to prevent injury or property damage. Annotate the DD Form 509, Inspection Record of Segregation or computer generated equivalent and annotate cell checks determined by confinement officer (NTE 15 minutes) on the DD Form 503, Health Assessment Certification for Segregation. If the housing in D-Seg, results in the confinee locked down a vast majority of the day, typically 22-hours or more, see Attachment 19, Limiting the Use of Restrictive Housing. (T-1) Paragraph 5.5.4.3. added: Protective Custody (commonly called “PC”). Confinees who require protection whether voluntary (confinee’s request) or involuntary (staff imposed) for the prevention of injury by others or to others, e.g., confinee’s prior cooperation with law enforcement or CF staff, adjudicated sex offenses, known gang affiliations, etc. Annotate the DD Form 509, Inspection Record of Segregation or computer generated equivalent and annotate cell checks determined by confinement officer (NTE 15 minutes) on the DD Form 503, Health Assessment Certification for Segregation. Generally, confinees who require protective custody should not be placed in RH. The confinement officer, to the extent feasible, develops strategies for safely housing these situations without using restrictive housing. For example, when a confinee faces a legitimate threat from another confinee, the confinement NCO/Officer should seek alternative housing (transferring either the abuser or the victim to another MCF) or use PC for the victim and ensure the conditions are comparable to general population. If the housing in PC (voluntary or involuntary), results in the confinee locked down a vast majority of the day, typically 22-hours or more, see Attachment 19, Limiting the Use of Restrictive Housing. (T-1) Change paragraph 5.5.5. to read: Restrictive Housing (RH). On 1 Mar 2016, a Presidential Memorandum for Limiting the Use of Restrictive Housing by the Federal Government was signed. In response, the DoJ issued Guiding Principles, i.e., best practices for correctional facilities. The goal is to design a system that is fair and consistent for confinees, regardless of status or custody classification, which allows confinees to be housed in the least restrictive housing necessary to ensure their own safety, as well as the safety of staff, other confinees, and the public. Reference Attachment 19 for the implementation of Limiting Restrictive Housing requirements. (T-0)           Renumber paragraph 5.5.5.1. to paragraph 5.5.6.1. Paragraph 5.11.1. added: NOTE 3: Confinement staff should avoid releasing confinees directly from RH to the community unless doing so would endanger the confinee or other confinees and staff. The goal is to release confinees from general population to the community. See Attachment A19.4. Paragraph 5.12.1. added: Additional Reporting Requirements. Facilities annually report RH and PREA data on separate document to accompany the submission of the DD Form 2720, Annual Confinement Report. Submit previous year’s data NLT 15 Jan to AFSFC/FC: Paragraph 5.12.1.2. added: System Wide Data Regarding Restrictive Housing. Data is collected, via instructions located on the SMARTNet, includes the incidence and prevalence of RH. This includes the total number of confinees in each type of A-Seg, RH recidivism rates (i.e., intra-facility), and the average length of stay. This annual (calendar year) consolidated information is to be publicly available on an AF public Web site. It includes demographic information for confinees, including race, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, and age, to the extent that the collection and publication of such information complies with all applicable laws. (T-0) Paragraph 5.12.1.3. added: Confinee Data for Restrictive Housing. This data allows confinement facilities to track individual confinees throughout their confinement period. This enables facilities to determine whether, how often, and how long a particular confinee has been placed in segregation, including the confinee changes in status (e.g., from A-Seg pending investigation to D-Seg). This information is to be made available to CF staff, to the extent consistent with applicable law (LE sensitive and privacy act), as a way to identify correctional and rehabilitative strategies to treat disruptive confinees. Follow RH data collection and reporting methods listed on the AFSFC SMARTNet. This data is not released publicly. (T-0) There are some situations that are not reported as RH, e.g., Initial A-Seg, etc. Paragraph 5.12.1.4. added: Confinement Staff Training Data for Restrictive Housing. Until a corrections database is available to provide annual reporting of staff training, CF staffs should annually maintain all confinement training that facilitate implementation of an early intervention system. The system is a management tool that promotes supervisory awareness and helps leadership identify trends, to revise local policy as needed, and deploy additional staff training where necessary. This information is not released publicly. (T-0) Paragraph 5.12.1.5. added: Annual PREA Report. Complete and send the PREA Annual Report to AFSFC/FC. See the AFSFC SMARTNet for report template. (T-0) Paragraph 5.12.1.6. added: PREA Staffing Plan. The DFC conducts an annual review of the staffing plan, which includes (but not limited) to the following: manpower, CCTV coverage, Facility capacity, and policy of documented on-duty/off-duty higher level         unannounced supervisory visits. DFC includes this information in a brief signed letter and sends to AFSFC/FC. See the AFSFC SMARTNet for report template. (T-0) Change paragraph 6.3.4. to read: Confinees receive the same food service locally available to active duty personnel on a meal card. Confinement staff provide confinees a safe, secure, and humane environment whether they are housed in general population or special quarters. The denial of food, water, and latrine breaks is prohibited. (T-0) DELETE NOTE at paragraph 7.2.2. Paragraph 7.2.2.1. added: Completely fill out the DD Form 2791. When completing the form for all four agency copies, use the local LE agency address in block 8. For block 9, if the member isn’t releasing directly to their local address, located in block 4, then annotate the parent Unit/MPF/FSS the SO was released to for out-processing. In addition, use Attachment 15, Sex Offender Registration Notification Cover Letter, as a template and provide to each of the agencies in addition to the DD Form 2791. (T-0) Change paragraph 7.2.3. to read: Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) and Military Sex Offender Reporting Act of 2015 (MSORA). Paragraph 7.2.3.1. added: SORNA. Pursuant to 42 USC §16901, et. al., the CF staff notifies appropriate federal and state authorities of all cases involving the release (from the military or from confinement) of court-martialed military members convicted of sexually violent offenses and/or sex offenses against victims who were minors (persons under the age of 16 years). (T-0) Paragraph 7.2.3.2. added: MSORA. Pursuant to 42 USC § 16928a, the CF staff is required to notify the jurisdiction the sex offender releases to, which in turn provides the notification to the DoJ National Sex Offender Registry and the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website (NSOPW), to comply with the SECDEF requirement to inform the Attorney General (AG) of persons required to register as a sex offender. Additionally, MSORA requires confinement facilities to notify the originating AFOSI Det of the SO’s release. (T-0) Change paragraph 7.2.7.3. to read: Sex Offender Registration. CF staff completes no later than 2 weeks prior to the offender’s release date from confinement (administratively, 4 weeks prior is the preferred time) or immediately upon sentencing when there is no post trial confinement, to ensure timely receipt by the agencies as identified on the DD Form 2791. Send a separate copy to each agency on the DD Form 2791 and also include a copy of the offenders Report of Result of Trial or CMO. Preferred method of sending for SORNA participating jurisdictions is to send via SORNA Exchange Portal and print read receipt page. Secondary method is to send in US Mail via Certified Mail/Return Receipt Requested (CM/RRR) and suspense the CM/RRR (PS Form 3811) for 14 days CONUS or 30 days for OCONUS to ensure notification. Attach proof of receipt to the CF’s file copy of the DD Form 2791 and place it in the offenders file. Document unreturned receipts, follow up and make reasonable attempts to locate the unreturned receipt. Contact AFSFC/FC for further instructions if attempts fail. The purpose is for the military to notify the agencies listed below of the offender’s specific crime by identifying/explaining the guilty findings in the Charges/Specifications and providing a copy of the Report of Result of Trial or CMO so the gaining civilian jurisdiction may properly determine their registration requirements due to the nature and circumstances surrounding the crime(s) committed. (T-0) Change paragraph 7.2.7.3.4. to read: Federal law enforcement. Comply with paragraph 7.2.6. to obtain passwords and account access. Then complete notification via DoJ SORNA Exchange Portal https://portal.nsopr.gov. If portal is down, alternate method is to mail the DD Form 2791 to: US Marshal Service, SOIB, NSOTC, CM4, 11th floor, Washington DC 20530-1000. Attn: Military Liaison. Email questions/confirm mailing to: IOD.NSOTC@usdoj.gov (unable to encrypt email). Contact AFSFC/FC if phone number is needed. (T-0) Paragraph 7.2.7.3.10. added:  International Travel by Sex Offenders. In accordance with Public Law 114-119, known as International Megan’s Law to Prevent Child Exploitation and Other Sexual Crimes through Advanced Notification of Traveling Sex Offenders and SORNA Sec 6, SO’s are required to inform their residence jurisdictions (e.g., local civilian LE agency) of intended travel OCONUS at least 21-days in advance of OCONUS travel. Further, registrants must inform their residence jurisdictions if they intend to reside, be employed, or attend school outside of the United States. Service members convicted of sex offenses are required to comply with these reporting requirements. If the confinement NCO is aware of intended OCONUS travel upon release from AF confinement, ensure the appropriate state registry and the USMS-NSOTC are informed of the type of travel (business or personal) and duration of their stay. (T-0) Change paragraph 9.2. to read: Administrative or Disciplinary Segregation Actions. Use segregation to enforce discipline standards, prevent injury, provide for observation, or maintain health. A-seg is used for newly arrived confinees to allow staff observation and the confinee to acclimate to their new situation (see paragraph 5.5.4.1. and 5.5.4.2. for time lines.) A-seg also includes temporary medical situations (e.g., flu, limbs with casts, etc.) and provides a secure setting for isolation. Additionally, A-seg includes protective custody or may include those awaiting results from D&A Bd. D-seg is for rules violation(s) and used to affect behavior modifications. Staff keeps all segregated confinees under close supervision, conducting checks, as required for the particular classifications, health or suicide checks, throughout the 24-hour day. The DFC, or SNCO or above designee in their absence, conducts daily documented blotter visits to confinees in D-seg. Do not mix administrative and disciplinary segregation confinees. Keep protective custody confinees away from all other confinees. Segregation based solely on sexual orientation is prohibited, unless as a result of a legal decree/settlement/court order. (T-0) NOTE: See DoDI 1325.07, Enclosure 2, Paragraph 10, for additional medical requirements and segregation timeline requirements. Change paragraph 9.2.2. to read: When a confinee is transferred to segregation for either administrative or disciplinary reasons, health care personnel are to be informed     immediately and provide assessment and review as indicated by the protocols established by the facility’s health authority (MTF). Thereafter, medical personnel are to visit the confinee in segregation at least once every day to observe the confinee’s health and the sanitary conditions of the segregation. Medical personnel document their visits and are to immediately inform the DFC of any unhealthful, unsafe, or unsanitary conditions, environmental and fire safety. The DFC is responsible for taking immediate action to correct any noted problem or unhealthful condition.

RH is defined when any of the special quarters categories involves the following three basic elements: 1) confinee removal from general population (voluntary or involuntary); 2) confinee placed/housed in a cell or locked room/bay (alone or with another confinee); and 3) confinee is unable to leave the cell or locked room/bay for a vast majority of the day, typically 22-hours or more. A confinee held in RH is offered medical support, mental health support as well as interaction with others, as appropriate. (T-0) NOTE: A lack of manpower is not considered a valid reason to keep a confinee in their cell over 22 hours a day. All instances of RH use require tracking and annual reporting. A19.1.1. RH is limited to those circumstances when objective evidence indicates a confinee poses a direct threat to safety of persons or a clear threat to safe and secure CF operations. (T-0) A19.1.2. In each instance, CF staffs are to clearly articulate and document the specific reason(s) for a confinee’s placement and retention in RH. Use the tracking method available on the AFSFC SMARTNet link to document all confinee RH record entries. The reason(s) and duration for use of RH is to be supported by objective-based rationale and factual statements. Confinees remain in RH no longer than necessary to address the specific reason(s) for their placement. (T-0) A19.1.3. Only use RH to serve a specific correctional purpose. When authorizing the use of RH, ensure to include the entries that clearly articulate the purpose(s) and circumstances. (T-0) A19.1.4. Document RH entries within the tracking method listed on the AFSFC SMARTNet. Also, document in confinees CTF and appropriate Desk Blotter per paragraph 3.3. (T-0) NOTE: RH confinee data is reported to AFSFC/FC annually (see paragraph 5.12.1.2.) A19.2. A confinee’s initial and ongoing placement in RH is to be reviewed regularly (i.e., no less than every 30 days) by the DFC, Confinement Officer, Medical Officer, and Mental Health provider. (T-0) NOTE: See DoDI 1325.07, Enclosure 2 Paragraph 10.e. for detailed information. A19.3. For every confinee in RH, the CF staff immediately develops a plan to return the confinee to general population as soon as practically possible. For confinees housed in RH for longer than 30 days or subject to elements of paragraph A19.1., the CF staff develops a written “step-down plan” as a supplement to the mental health provider’s “special handling letter” for returning the confinee to less restrictive conditions, including return to general population, as promptly as possible. The contents of both documents are to be shared with the confinee, unless doing so would jeopardize the safety of the confinee, staff, other confinees, or the general public. (T-0) A19.4. End-of-Term Placement. Absent a compelling reason, confinees are not released from RH directly to the community. When behavior shows positive modification, return to general population in sufficient time to allow re-acclimation prior to pending release date. A19.4.1. During the final 180-days of a confinee’s projected release from confinement, CF Staffs make every effort to avoid placing the confinee in RH; particularly, under conditions expressed in paragraph A19.1. If a confinee is housed in segregation 180-days out from the end of their projected release date, CF Staff consider releasing the confinee to a less restrictive housing if this can be done without endangering the safety of the confinee, staff, other confinees, or the public. If segregation becomes necessary during this timeframe, ensure re-entry programming is completed to prepare the confinee for return to the community. (T-0) A19.5. D-Seg RH. CF Staffs adhere to specific published policies, per this AFI, to determine conditions confinees can be placed in segregation in response to an alleged disciplinary violation; both during investigative stage and after an administrative finding of guilt. (T-0) A19.5.1. CF Staffs confer with prosecutors and other law enforcement officials to ensure confinees who engage in serious criminal activity are held accountable and face criminal prosecution. (T-0) A19.6. Pre-Adjudication (Pending Investigation) Use of A-Seg/D-Seg. While a confinee is pending an investigation for misconduct, do not place in Seg unless paragraph 5.5.4. is met. Craft policy and training requirements to carefully ensure this principle is not overly interpreted to permit the imposition of RH for infrequent, lower level misconduct. (T-0) A19.6.1. A confinee’s initial placement in Seg, pending an investigation, is to be reviewed by the DFC or designee, NTE 24 hours or next duty day (whichever occurs later). (T-0) A19.6.2. Time confinees spend in Seg, pending an investigation, is to be credited towards the term they ultimately serve in D-Seg for that offense. Absent compelling circumstances, such as a pending criminal investigation, do not keep confinees in Seg pending investigation for a period of time longer than the maximum term of D-Seg permitted for the most serious charged offense per this AFI (refer to D&A Bd Disciplinary Actions under appropriate Category Offense). (T-0)        NOTE: The disciplinary investigation is completed as expeditiously as possible (NTE 7 business days, unless for cause) extensions are approved by the DFC or designee. A19.6.3. A confinee who demonstrates good behavior during A-Seg pending investigation is considered by the DFC (with consultation as appropriate by the Corrections Officer, Medical Officer, and Mental Health provider) for release back to the general population while awaiting their disciplinary hearing (i.e., D&A Bd). Similarly, if a confinee is ultimately adjudicated guilty, the confinee’s good behavior is to be given due consideration when determining the appropriate administrative disciplinary action. (T-0) A19.7. Post-Adjudication (Disciplinary Segregation). DFCs use RH only as necessary and only after other available sanctions or management actions are insufficient to serve the corrective nature of punishment. Not all infractions of disciplinary rules require RH. (T-0) A19.7.1. Disciplinary sanctions, regardless if it involves a period of segregation, are to be applied in a fair, firm and consistent manner, and only after due process as codified in Defense and AF Instructions. (T-0) A19.7.2. Reference the violations and recommended actions (see paragraph 9.1.5.) for maximum penalties for each level of offense. These penalties include alternatives to placement in RH. The penalties are based on the seriousness of the offense(s). Use of RH is generally for offenses involving violence, attempted escape, or posing a threat to good order and discipline by encouraging others to engage in such misconduct. Adherence to policy and training is to be crafted carefully to ensure this principle is not overly interpreted to permit the imposition of RH for infrequent, lower level misconduct. (T-0) A19.7.3. A confinee is administratively given a term of D-Seg only after DFC approves the D&A Bd recommendations to impose Seg. Conduct the D&A Bd per paragraph 9.1. (T-0) A19.7.4. When a disciplinary hearing officer has concerns which could negatively affect rehabilitation or is confronted with a confinee who demonstrates symptoms of mental illness, the D&A Bd refers the confinee to a qualified Mental Health provider for input concerning impact on rehabilitation and/or competency to participate in the D&A Bd. Consider the impact mental illness may have on their responsibility for the charged behavior and information about any known mitigating factors in regard to the alleged behavior. Give due consideration to certain types of sanctions (e.g., placement in D-Seg, loss of visits, loss of phone calls, or other privileges, etc.) because they could interfere with confinee’s rehabilitative treatment plan. Disciplinary hearing officers take into account the clinical findings and recommendations when deciding what, if any, sanctions to recommend. These actions are documented on the DD Form 2714, Prisoner Disciplinary Report/Action. (T-0) A19.7.5. Ordinarily, administrative disciplinary actions for offenses that arise out of the same episode are served concurrently (i.e., run at the same time). (T-0)                 A19.7.6. To incentivize conduct that enhances institutional safety and security, confinees who demonstrate good behavior and compliance to requirements during D-Seg should be given consideration for early release from RH. (T-0) A19.8. Protective Custody (PC). Generally, confinees who require PC are not to be placed in RH. When a confinee faces a legitimate threat from other confinees, CF staff seeks alternative housing by transferring the threatened confinee to another MCF or to a safe housing location (cell/Bay) with conditions comparable to those of general populations. (T-0) A19.8.1. There are two exceptions: A19.8.1.1. When the confinee poses extraordinary security risks that even an applicable general population is insufficient to ensure the confinee’s safety and the safety of staff, other confinees, and the general public. In such cases, the confinee may be housed in RH. The confinee’s placement is to be reviewed regularly to monitor any medical or mental health deterioration and to determine whether the extraordinary security risks have subsided. (T-0) A19.8.1.2. During a brief investigative period while correctional staff attempt to verify the need for PC or while the confinee is awaiting transfer to another facility. (T-0) A19.8.2. When necessary to transfer a confinee to another MCF for PC reasons, consult with AFSFC/FC for assistance. When possible, AFSFC/FC considers the release residence when determining a transfer location when the confinee requests to be housed close to family. (T-0) A19.8.3. CFs track and document the most common reasons confinees request PC (e.g., prior cooperation with law enforcement, conviction of sex offense, gang affiliation, sex, or gender identification, etc.) to develop strategies for safely housing these confinees outside of RH. (T-0) A19.9. Preventative Segregation. Confinees in RH can be placed in A-Seg for preventative measures (i.e., suicide watch) when the DFC determines no other form of housing can ensure the confinee’s safety and the safety of staff, other confinees, and the public. The determination is to be guided by clearly articulated reasons and documented in the CTF and other data-systems as directed, i.e., RH data tools, CORMIS or SFMIS Corrections Module. Confinees in the AFCS (i.e., Level I CFs) are not normally placed in long-term/extended RH, i.e., more than 30-days. Consult AFSFC/FC for guidance in situations exceeding this period. (T-1) A19.9.1. The DFC or in their absence, a designee, documents their daily RH reviews/visits with confinees in the appropriate Desk Blotter. These observation visits assist management to facilitate a transition back to general population as soon as it is safe to do so. If it is determined confinees housed in RH are unable to be transitioned back to general          population (due to safety reasons) within 30-days, consult AFSFC/FC for further guidance. (T-0) A19.10. Conditions of Confinement. Design the CF’s RH plan of the day to allow confinees, regardless of status or category, no less than 2 hours outside of their cell, unless for cause. CF staff seeks ways to increase this 2 hour minimum amount of out-of-cell time and when possible to offer enhanced in-cell opportunities. Out-of-cell time counts when used for recreation, education, clinically appropriate treatment therapies, skill-building, and social interaction with staff and other confinees (if other confinees are of the same status/custody classification as the RH confinee, unless otherwise prohibited by medical/MH provider or in Paragraph 5.3 of this AFI). These authorized opportunities should be documented on the confinee’s special handling letter (provided by the medical/MH provider). (T-0) A19.10.1. CF staffs provide confinees in RH out-of-cell, confidential psychological assessment visits whenever possible to ensure patient privacy and to eliminate treatment barriers. (T-0) A19.10.2. The denial of basic human needs such as food, water, and latrine breaks are never to be used as punishment, whether alone or in conjunction with the use of RH. (T-0) A19.11. Confinees With Serious Mental Illness (SMI). Prior to placement in RH (or when that is infeasible, as soon as possible but no later than first duty day after placement) a Mental Health provider, in collaboration with CF staff, promptly screens available medical records to determine whether the confinee has a previous history of SMI or is at risk of developing SMI. (T-0) A19.11.1. In disciplinary circumstances, a lack of responsibility for the misconduct due to mental illness or mitigating factors related to the mental illness do not contraindicate D-Seg unless a credentialed Mental Health provider determines the following: A19.11.1.1. Such temporary placement is not inappropriate (contraindicated). (T-0) A19.11.1.2. The confinee is not a suicide risk. (T-0) A19.11.1.3. The confinee does not have active psychotic symptoms. (T-0) A19.11.2. Confinees who were screened for and determined to have SMI are not to be placed in RH. The DFC or designee coordinates with qualified Mental Health provider to advocate that confinees with SMI are diverted and placed in a clinically appropriate alternative form of housing, such as a secure mental health facility or other residential psychological treatment program provided by the nearest medical center (per existing agreements), or transferred to a confinement facility capable of managing such confinees. Certain confinees requiring long-term psychiatric treatment may be transferred to a Federal psychiatric treatment facility, IAW Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Art 76b. (T-0) NOTE 1: Unless already covered in an existing agreement, the DFC ensures a Support Agreement, Contract, or Memorandum of Agreement is established to provide mental health services (including RH guidelines in this instruction) with the nearest military mental health clinic or a contract with the nearest civilian medical or mental health clinic. NOTE 2: Consult with the SJA to initiate a new updated DD Form 2707, Confinement Order, when medical/mental health determines the confinee is no longer “fit” for confinement. A19.11.3. If an immediate and serious danger is present and there is no reasonable alternative until the SMI confinee is transferred to a medical facility or other treatment center, the CF ensures the following: (T-0) A19.11.3.1. Multiple times per day, correctional staff, trained in identifying signs of mental health decompensation/deterioration, are to conduct visits of the confinee in RH; (T-0) A19.11.3.2. At least once per day, a medical or mental health provider is to conduct rounds of confinees in RH; (T-0) A19.11.3.3. The staff also makes reasonable efforts to provide confinees with in-cell and out-of-cell mental health recommended activities as well as unstructured out-of-cell time consideration to the extent possible (e.g., weighing confinee’s behavior risk with the number of other confinees and staff ratio) while ensuring the safety of the confinee, other confinees, and staff; (T-0) A19.11.3.4. If at any point a confinee shows signs of psychological (mental) deterioration while in RH, the confinee is to be immediately evaluated by the Mental Health provider. At the conclusion of this review, mental health staff update the confinee’s mental health status to the DFC or designee who determines whether to increase cell checks or have direct supervision of the confinee until transferred. (T-0) A19.12. Juveniles (Under 18 years old). In the rare situation a military member under the age of 18 is confined, use the following processes: A19.12.1. Juveniles are not to be placed in RH. (T-0) A19.12.2. In response to behavior that poses a serious and immediate risk of physical harm to any person, separate the juvenile from others briefly (NTE 24 hours). This is designed to be a “cool down” period, and done only in consultation with a Mental Health provider. (T-0) A19.13. Young Adults (Age 18-24). CF staff are required to receive initial and continuation training (every 2 years) on young adult brain development, and appropriate de-escalation tactics. (T-0) Upon approval of DoD’s formal training methods/material concerning Young (18-24 year old) Brain Development it will be posted on the AFSFC                  SMARTNet. Until posted, consult with the local military medical and mental health providers for information on the subject. (T-1) A19.13.1. CFs incorporate developmentally responsive procedures and practices for young adults, as resources allow. (T-0) NOTE: Those confinees who are young adults with sentences over 90-days remaining upon arrival at a higher level DoD MCF, should be transferred as long as bed-space is available. A19.14. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex (LGBTI) and Gender Nonconforming. The Prison Rape Elimination Act national standards apply. Confinees who are LGBTI or whose appearance or manner does not conform to traditional gender expectations are not placed in RH solely on the basis of identification or gender status. (T-0) A19.14.1. When a confinee who is LGBTI or gender nonconforming faces a legitimate threat from other confinees, the confinement NCO consults with the confinement officer for approval for alternative housing. Conditions are to be comparable to those of general population housing to the fullest extent possible. (T-0) A19.14.2. Correctional staff can sometimes avoid the unnecessary use of RH for PC reasons by making different classification or housing assignments. In deciding whether to assign a transgender or intersex confinee to a facility or program for male or female confinees, the DFC or confinement officer considers on a case-by-case basis whether a placement would ensure the confinee’s health and safety, giving consideration to the confinee. (T-0) A19.15. Pregnant and Post-Partum Confinees. Female confinees who are pregnant, who are post-partum, who recently had a miscarriage, or who recently had a terminated pregnancy are not placed in RH. (See paragraph 5.8.4. for addition considerations.) (T-0) A19.15.1. When a female confinee who is pregnant, is post-partum, recently had a miscarriage, or recently had a terminated pregnancy poses a serious and immediate risk of physical harm to self or others, separate the confinee from others NTE 24 hours and conduct suicide watch if appropriate. This is designed to be a “cool down” period, and done only in consultation with a Medical Officer and Mental Health provider. If behavior does not improve after the cool down period, i.e., serious and immediate risk of physical harm to self or others continues, then consult with Multidisciplinary Treatment Team and notify AFSFC/FC. (T-0) A19.16. Confinees with Medical Needs. All confinees in RH are to receive unfettered access to appropriate medical care, including prescribed medications and emergency medical care. A19.16.1. When the CF lacks the capacity to provide appropriate medical care to a confinee in RH, the Confinement NCO coordinates with mental health and the local leadership to send the confinee to a local medical facility or appropriate local jail for pretrial detainees (normally) and inmates with sentences under 120-days. For inmates with sentences over 120-days, the confinement NCO may send AFSFC/FC a Transfer Request. The Director, AF Confinement and Corrections designates an appropriate MCF after consulting with the AFCS Director, Clinical Services on housing locations to receive necessary medical treatment. (T-0) A19.17. Data Collection and Transparency. CF staff collect and input data about several aspects of their use of RH via the method listed on the AFSFC SMARTNet. Though specifically, for facility and agency reporting purposes, the “restrictive housing” definition used in this instruction are to be used. See paragraph 5.12.1. (T-1)   A19.18. RH Training. The confinement officer is responsible to ensure staff training/documentation is completed on signs of Mental Health Decompensation/deterioration, as well as, on Young Brain Development and Appropriate De-escalation Tactics (refer to paragraphs 2.6.2.21. and 2.6.2.22.) (T-1)   The guidance in this Memorandum becomes void after 1 year has elapsed from the date of this Memorandum, or upon incorporation by interim change to, or a rewrite of AFI 31-105, Air Force Corrections System, whichever is earlier.

Program Policy and Purpose.  The Air Force Corrections System (AFCS) provides quality confinement  and  rehabilitation  services.  The  primary  system  recipients  are  pretrial  detainees pending  a  court-martial  and  post-trial  inmates  serving  a  court-martial  sentence  to  confinement. (Hereafter,  pretrial  detainees  and  post-trial  inmates  are  collectively  referred  to  as  confinees unless an exact confinement status indication is necessary.) The AFCS ensures a secure, humane, and  productive  environment  for  confinees  and  staff.  All  confinees  receive  fair  and  humane treatment  according  to  laws,  instructions,  and  directives  consistent  with  custody  requirements. The AFCS provides opportunities for confinee education, training and rehabilitation. Those not retained for further military service have the opportunity to return to society as a responsible and productive  citizen.  The  AFCS  is  committed  to  ensuring  that  confinees,  crime  victims,  and witnesses are afforded all the rights and privileges to which they are entitled under law. Further, the AFCS is committed to ensuring the prevention, detection, response and elimination of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, and all other types of violence against confinees. The AFCS creates a system of management to ensure all applicable requirements are met. 1.2.  Program  Guidelines.  The AFCS is based upon a corrective rather than punitive basis for post-trial inmates. It  requires positive programs to preserve and strengthen an inmate’s dignity. Inmates receive sentences to  confinement as punishment not  for punishment. Pretrial  detainees are  confined  pursuant  to  a  pretrial  confinement  order.  This  AFI  implements  and  complements DoDI  1325.07,  Administration  of  Military  Correctional  Facilities  and  Clemency  and  Parole Authority, and DoDD 1325.04, Confinement of Military Prisoners and Administration of Military Correctional  Programs  and  Facilities.  The  AFI  defers  to  the  DoDI  and  DoDD  if  necessary  to resolve  any  narrative  differences,  but  the  AFI  may  increase  the  compliance  requirements  from the DoDI and DoDD. 1.2.1.  Post-trial inmates serve sentences of confinement under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Pretrial confinement is not punishment; rather, it is to prevent harm and/or eliminate  flight  risk  while  awaiting  trial.  Pretrial  detainees  found  guilty  are  credited  with their time served. (T-0) 1.2.2.  Confinees  in  DoD  or  non-DoD  facilities  are  subject  to  that  facility’s  legally  applied rules  or  directives  including  conduct,  administrative  discipline,  uniforms,  procedures  and treatment. (T-0) 1.2.2.1.  If  a  Military  Confinement  Facility  is  not  reasonably  available,  the  installation commander may authorize confinees to be placed into civilian facilities used or approved by  the  US  Marshals  Service  (USMS).  If  such  a  facility  is  not  reasonably  available,  a military confinee may be transferred to a facility accredited by the American Correctional Association (ACA) or a facility accredited by the State in which the confinee is located. Only use/contract with those non-military facilities that are Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) compliant or actively seeking PREA compliance. If immediate USMS assistance is required after hours, contact the USMS Command Center at 1-800-336-0102. (T-0) 1.2.2.2.  Support Agreements (SA) and Contracts. Any circumstance that would cause an anticipated  incarceration  at  a  location  other  than  the  parent  installation  necessitates  a AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 9 written SA (with a Federal or DoD entity) or contract (with a non-federal government or a  civilian  entity)  to  ensure  promised  services  and  payments  are  rendered  IAW  AFI  25-201,  Intra-Service,  Intra-Agency,  and  Inter-Agency  Support  Agreements  Procedures. Reasons for an installation to have a SA/contracts in effect include, but are not limited to, the lack of an organic  correctional  facility;  natural  disaster preparedness  should organic facility become unusable; or lack of bed space (temporary high population, gender mix of the  confinees,  special  needs  of  the  confinee,  etc.).  Coordinate  emergency  and  unusual circumstances that would preclude the ability to properly execute a SA/contract with Air Force  Security  Forces  Center,  Corrections  Division  (AFSFC/SFC),  for  assistance.  If possible, AFSFC/SFC assists with placement and transfer of confinees not covered by an existing  SA  or  contracts.  The  parent  installation  still  retains  responsibility  to  secure appropriate  facilities  via  SA  or  contract.  When  desiring  to  establish  a  SA  with  a  sister Service  facility,  route  through  AFSFC/SFC,  who  in-turn  pre-coordinates  with  that Service’s Correctional HQs. (T-1) 1.2.2.2.1.  Possible solutions for housing confinees in  prioritized order: organic base facility,  other  DoD  facilities,  and  then  civilian  governmental  operated  facilities.  No member  of  the  armed  forces  may  be  placed  in  confinement  with  foreign  nationals whom are not members of the armed forces (IAW Article 12, UCMJ) as well as not punishing pretrial detainees except for the need to confine (IAW Article 13, UCMJ). For safety and security, separate both high profile and military unique charged (e.g., espionage,  etc.)  confinees,  when  using  non-military  facilities,  from  the  general population. Confinees are subject to that facility’s instructions/policies (i.e., conduct, administrative discipline, etc.), unless specifically waived in the SA. (T-0)  1.2.2.2.1.1.  NOTE  1:  See paragraph 5.5 for additional information on quarter’s assignments. 1.2.2.2.2.  All  SA  or  contracts  must  be  in  writing  and  should  detail  responsibilities and services IAW AFI 25-201. AFSFC/SFC provides review, guidance and approval for  all  SAs  to  ensure  confinement  and  treatment  standards.  Provide  copy  of installation’s most current SA or contract to AFSFC/SFC, 1517 Billy Mitchell Blvd, JBSA Lackland TX  78236-0119 (DSN FAX: 945-5411). (T-0) 1.2.2.2.2.1.  SA  or  Contract  standards  to  be  negotiated  include,  but  are  not  be limited to; separation of pretrial detainees from post-trial inmates to the maximum extent possible, separation of offenders charged with or committed minor offenses from offenders charged with or committed serious offenses (as determined by the DFC to the maximum extent possible), facility condition and cleanliness. Ensure compliance with paragraph 1.2.2.1. (T-0) 1.2.2.2.2.2.  SA or contracts negotiations should ensure accessibility to confinees by unit, legal, medical, and chaplain personnel, etc., and the ability of the facility to temporarily release and/or re-confine as needed. Ensure the meals provided are sufficient  in  quality,  quantity  and  can  meet  special  dietary  requirements  (e.g., religious, medical, etc.). (T-1) Ensure obligation for the provider to comply with Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and allow for compliance monitoring by the installation. (T-0) 10 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 1.2.2.2.3.  Normally, all transfers internal to the AFCS are approved and facilitated by AFSFC/SFC,  unless  using  a  previously  AFSFC/SFC  coordinated/approved  SA  or contract. (T-1) 1.2.2.2.3.1.  EXCEPTION:  When conducting transfers under a preapproved SA or contract for a high profile confinee (due to notoriety of the offense or previous rank/position)  notify  AFSFC/SFC  whose  expertise  can  provide  planning assistance with these type missions. local  Memorandum  or  Operating  Instructions  with  base 1.2.2.2.4.  Establish installation  support  agencies, i.e.,  Chaplain,  Services  (dining  facility),  and Medical/Mental Health Services, to maintain consistency of support service(s) for the facility,  especially  when  Confinement  Facilities  (CFs)  may  require  assistance  above the  normal  level  of  service.  Housing  confinees  off-base  does  not  eliminate  an installation’s responsibility for medical/social services, rehabilitation, etc. (T-1) 1.2.2.2.5.  The  parent  unit’s  financial  responsibility  for  transferring  a  confinee  is  to use Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds for costs associated with housing and escort(s). Transfers into the AFCS are paid by PCS ID code E (CONUS) and code J (OCONUS). (T-0) 1.2.3.  Do not use correctional personnel or facilities for AFI 31-208, Remotivation Program (ne:  Correctional  Custody).  Do  not  allow  Remotivation  Program  Correctees  to  have  direct contact with AFCS confinees. (T-1) 1.2.4.  The  installation  commander  may  approve,  on  a  case-by-case  emergency  basis, temporary  use  of  their  CFs  to  house  transient  confinees  under  the  control  of  civilian  law enforcement officers. Consult with the SJA beforehand. (T-3) 1.2.4.1.  Do not use military personnel as guards for the transients or transient guards for military confinees. Do not mix military confinees with these transients. Consult with the local SJA to ensure conditions do not violate Articles 12 and 13, UCMJ before allowing emergency civilian use. (T-0) 1.2.5.  The DoD and AFCS consist of three levels of facilities: Level I, Level II and Level III. See Attachment 1 for definitions. 1.3.  Corrections System Responsibilities: 1.3.1.  HQ USAF/A4S establishes policy for the AFCS. 1.3.2.  HQ AFDW/CC, JB Andrews MD, is the General Courts-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA)  for  inmates  assigned  (including  those  on  appellate  leave)  to  AFSFC/SFC.  This also includes all AF parolees and those on Mandatory Supervised Release. (T-1) 1.3.3.  AFSFC/CC  commands  the  Corrections  Division  and  the  associated  corrections Detachments and  Operating  Locations (OL).  Unless  delegated to the Vice Commander, the AFSFC/CC  also  establishes  warrants  issued  by  the  AF  Clemency  and  Parole  Board (AFC&PB) by authorizing transmittal into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). 1.3.4.  AFSFC/SFC  is  the  single  OPR  for  confinee  management  and  oversight  of  AFCS. Responsibilities  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  correctional  program  development,  training standards  and  guidance,  bed  space  management,  confinee  classification  criteria,  confinee AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 11 transfers, and compliance with Federal Statutes, as well as DoD and AF directives regarding corrections.  To  meet  these  responsibilities,  AFSFC/SFC  is  authorized  to  direct  local  unit compliance with applicable instructions as necessary to meet the stated goals and objectives of DoDD 1325.04, DoDI 1325.07, and this Instruction. 1.3.4.1.  Duties/responsibilities of AFSFC/SFC: 1.3.4.1.1.  Implements  and  oversees  the  AFCS  worldwide  and  approves  all  waivers unless otherwise delegated in this Instruction. 1.3.4.1.2.  Responsible  for  pay  and  personnel  matters  concerning  AF  confinees  or appellants  gained  by  AFSFC/SFC.  The  Director,  AF  Corrections,  is  the  AFSFC commander’s designated representative on any AFSFC confinee personnel or military pay  action  requiring  a  designated  representative  signature  and  is  the  AFSFC commander’s  designated  representative  signature  involving  cancellation  of  parole violation warrants after return to military control. 1.3.4.1.3.  Responsible  for  all  sister  Service  correctional  liaisons  within  the  DoD correctional system. (ref: paragraph 1.2.2.2. for SA guidance and restrictions.) 1.3.4.1.4.  Coordinates, directs,  and approves  all  AF confinee  transfers in  and out  of confinement or correctional facilities, to include all transfers between AF facilities or transfers  into  DoD  Facilities,  unless  there  is  an  AFSFC/SFC  coordinated/approved SA  or  contract.  NOTE:  The  PBD  720  directed  streamlining  of  many  processes. Confinement/corrections  experienced the  elimination  of  MAJCOM/SFs  from notification and involvement with routine issues including transfer messages. 1.3.4.1.5.  Maintains  administrative  records  for  those  on  parole  or  Mandatory Supervised  Release  (MSR),  when  administratively  assigned  to  AFSFC/SFC.  As appropriate,  coordinates  issues  regarding  the  parolee  with  the  last  assigned corrections facility or last assigned permanent duty station. While individuals are on parole/MSR  or  appellate  review,  they  remain  the  operational  responsibility  of  the losing  parent  unit  (unit  which  sought  the  court-martial)  for  items  such  as;  Line  of Duty  Determinations,  casualty  reporting,  and  family  assistance.  (See  current  AFPC PGMs on Appellate Leave Responsibilities.) (T-1) 1.3.4.1.6.

(T-0) 1.3.4.2.  Designated  as  the  AF  Central  Repository  (CR)  for  the  AF  Victim/Witness Assistance Program (AF VWAP). AFSFC/SFC serves as a clearinghouse of information on confinee status and collects and reports data on the delivery of the victim and witness 12 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 assistance program, including notification of confinee status changes IAW DoDD 1030.1, Victim  and  Witness  Assistance,  paragraph  5.3.3.  and  AFI  51-201,  Administration  of Military Justice, paragraph 7. 1.3.4.2.1.  To  fulfill  these  functions,  AFSFC/SFC  designates  a  Central  Repository Responsible  Official  (CRRO)  for  AF  VWAP  notifications.  However,  the  Judge Advocate General (TJAG) remains the AF’s Responsible Official (RO) for managing the overall AF VWAP. 1.3.4.2.2.  Scope of responsibilities for the CRRO includes: 1.3.4.2.2.1.  Receives  a  post-trial  copy  of  DD  Form  2704,  Victim/Witness Certification  and  Election  Concerning  Inmate  Status,  from  the  SJA,  indicating whether  the  victim/witness  elects  notification  IAW  DoDI  1030.2,  Victim  and Witness Procedures, paragraph 6.4.2., and AFI 51-201, Chapter 7. (T-0) 1.3.4.2.2.2.  Files the DD Form 2704 in  AFSFC/SFC's CR for all inmates and is retained by the inmate’s last name alphabetically by year court-martialed. 1.3.4.2.2.3.

If  this  option  is  unavailable, victim(s)/witness(es) may write the CR at AFSFC/SFC, 1517 Billy Mitchell Blvd, JBSA Lackland, TX  78236-0119. Once written requests are received, the CRRO updates victim/witness notification data by changing election status and attaching written requests to the filed copy of the form. If circumstances warrant immediate notification  after legal  office, victim(s)/witness(es) may contact the CRRO at 1-877-273-3098, extension 5607, or email: afsfc.sfcv@us.af.mil. failed  attempts to  contact the  base 1.3.4.2.2.6.

The  AF  Corrections,  Chief,  Clinical  Services,  for  the  AFCS  is  assigned  to  AFSFC Detachment 2. 1.3.5.1.  Provides  oversight  for  rehabilitation,  evaluation,  treatment,  and  professional recommendations  with  regard  to  selection  and  use  of  confinee  programs  within  the AFCS. (T-1) 1.3.5.2.  Serves  as  a  focal  point  for  behavioral  health  services  and  pre-release  programs within the AFCS and for consultation with others (i.e., Area Defense Counsel, Judiciary, AFC&PB) concerning these services. (T-1) 1.3.5.3.  Serves  as  liaison  with  AF  rehabilitation  staff  assignments  and  credentialing agencies. AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 13 1.3.5.4.  Develops and implements, in coordination with AFSFC/SFC, training, treatment, and transition requirements and programs for AF Level I CFs. (T-1) 1.3.6.  Commanders  of  AFSFC  Detachment  1,  US  Disciplinary  Barracks,  Ft  Leavenworth KS,  and  Detachment  2,  Naval  Consolidated  Brig,  Marine  Corps  Air  Station  Miramar  CA, and  their  AF  staffs  are  responsible  for  the  welfare  and  administration  of  confinees incarcerated  at  their  respective  locations.  The  commanders  also  support  behavioral  health programs,  education/vocational  testing,  and  security  as  required  by  the  support  agreement. NOTE:  For  the  purpose  of  this  instruction,  detachment  commanders  have  the  same responsibilities  and  authority  as  described  for  the  installation  Defense  Force  Commander (DFC)  concerning  correctional  decisions.  Host  service  (Army,  Navy)  specific  equivalent programs already in place at those institutions satisfy the requirements of this instruction. 1.3.7.  The  Executive  Secretary  of  the  AFC&PB,  or  designee,  chairs  the  Board  and announces  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SAF)  on  clemency,  parole, restoration to duty, and reenlistment coding of those adjudicated by a courts-martial. 1.3.8.  The Director, AF Corrections (AFSFC/SFC), is a voting member of the AFC&PB. 1.3.9.  The  Chief,  Clemency,  Corrections,  and  Officer  Review  (AFLOA/JAJR),  advises AFSFC/SFC on legal matters concerning corrections and rehabilitation issues and is a voting member of the AFC&PB. 1.3.9.1.  The installation SJA provides the installation DFC and confinement officer with legal  interpretation,  guidance  on  confinement  matters,  and  information  concerning  the offenses. 1.3.10.  Installation  commanders  maintain  the  capability  to  house  pretrial  detainees  and adjudged  inmates  with  sentences  up  to  1  year,  through  organic  confinement  facilities, adjacent  DoD  facilities,  civilian  contracts,  or  a  combination  of  organic,  SA  or  contract derived bed space. (T-1) 1.3.10.1.  The  need  for  a  1  year  capability  is  to  ensure  housing  of  long  term  pretrial detainees and to provide adequate flexibility when there is a waiting list for DoD Level II or III transfers. For post-trial confinements over 120 days, with a punitive discharge, the confinement  NCOs  may  coordinate  with  AFSFC/SFCT  (Inmate  Transfers)  to  seek  a possible space available transfer to a Level II facility. (T-1) 1.3.10.1.1.  NOTE:  History has shown that moving inmates who do not arrive with at least 90 days remaining on their sentence is usually not cost effective. Confinement NCOs with questions should contact AFSFC/SFCT. 1.3.10.2.  Installations  having  an  organic  Confinement  Facility  (including  Holding  and Detention  Cells,  see  paragraphs  2.1.3.  and  2.1.4.  for  definitions)  implement  their confinement programs according to this instruction and ensure adequate O&M funding to comply with all appropriate policies, procedures and standards associated with operation of a confinement facility. (T-0) 1.3.10.2.1.  NOTE  :  Even  though  installations  may  use  civilian  contracts,  there  are certain  requirements  contained  in  this  instruction  which  require  completion  of confinement  NCO  duties  due  to  compliance  with  federal  law  and  DoD/AF 14 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 instructions  for  programs  such  as:  VWAP,  DNA  collections  and  submissions,  Sex Offender registrations and Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) requirements. 1.3.10.3.  Installation commanders already maintain a zero tolerance written standard for sexual abuse, sexual harassment, and all other types of violence by prevention planning and enforcement of appropriate measures within their command. In addition, installation commanders ensure their staffs monitor prevention, detection, and response to allegations for their Confinement Facility. (T-0) 1.3.10.4.  Installation  commanders  ensure  SA  or  contracts  with  another  correctional facility must be coordinated and approved as described in paragraph 1.2.2.2. (T-1) 1.3.11.  Parent unit responsibilities (unit that preferred court-martial charges): 1.3.11.1.  Parent  units  are  responsible  to  provide  for  their  confined  Airmen;  escorts  (if needed by the DFC), escort travel (transfer) orders, uniform items (as required), funding (if necessary), and to assist confined members’ families. Parent unit conducted command visits (by commanders, first sergeants, or a designed unit representative) is to be at least monthly. However, if the confinee is  geographically separated, the parent  unit conducts (and  documents)  at  least  monthly  telephonic  contacts  with  the  confinee  vice  in  person visits.  Upon  AFSFC/SFC’s  personnel  force  gaining  action  the  unit  is  relieved  of  their responsibility except as noted in paragraph 1.3.4.1.5. (T-1) 1.3.11.2.  Use  of  the  confinee’s  parent  unit  personnel  is  authorized  to  augment  SF  in order  to  cover  and  sustain  confinement  operations.  However,  the  detailed  parent  unit personnel  do  not  necessarily  have  to  be  assigned  to  the  Confinement  section.  For example, the DFC can decide to place the detailed parent unit member on another SF post or duty in order to free up a SF member for confinement duties (e.g., this would be most useful in situations when the confined member is in maximum custody). (T-3) 1.3.11.3.  Transportation  of  confinees  to  military  appointments  (e.g.,  medical,  mental health, chaplain, legal, etc.) may require parent unit assistance. The DFC may require this manning  assistance  when  transporting/transferring  to  another  confinement  facility. NOTE:  If  prohibitive  due  to  custody  classification,  thus  requiring  SF  to  conduct  the escort,  the  unit  provides  fund  cite  and  backfill  of  manpower  to  SF  to  accomplish  the transfer. 1.3.11.4.  Properly trained parent unit personnel may escort minimum custody inmates to perform work details inside or outside of the facility. (T-1) 1.3.11.5.  The  parent  unit  commander  is  responsible  for  updating  the  personnel  data system of changes in duty status until the confinee is gained by AFSFC/SFC. Individual circumstances  may  dictate  that  confinees  are  not  gained,  such  as:  no  punitive  discharge ordered,  or  as  determined  by  AFSFC/SFC.  It  is  the  policy  of  AFSFC/SFC  to  aid  the parent unit by assisting in the personnel administration process or doing a personnel force gain when possible and appropriate. (T-1) 1.3.11.6.  The  parent  unit  ensures  a  copy  of  the  AF  Form  2098,  Duty  Status  Change,  is received  for  placement  into  the  Correctional  Treatment  File  (CTF)  at  the  Confinement Facility.  The  parent  unit  also  updates  duty  status  codes  and  processes  through  the  local Force Support Squadron (FSS) and Financial Services Office (FSO). (T-1) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 15 1.3.11.6.1.  NOTE:  See Attachment 2 for CTF list of contents. 1.3.11.7.  The  parent  unit  assists  inmates  with  dependents  when  applying  for  household goods  relocation  using  AFI  36-3020,  Family  Member  Travel,  and  the  Joint  Travel Regulation (JTR). (T-0) 1.3.11.8.  Parent  units  are  responsible  for  the  confinee’s  orders  and  transportation arrangements on transfers. For specific guidance on orders, refer to the appropriate AFPC Personnel Services Delivery Guide (PSDG). (T-1) 1.3.11.9.  Parent unit ensures confinees in non-pay status are provided haircuts and issued Health  and  Comfort  (H&C)  items  according  to  facility  guidelines.  Haircuts  and  H&C items  are  purchased  for  confinees  in  non-pay  status  using  parent  unit  O&M  funds  or provided  as  part  of  the  facility’s  established  stock  purchased  through  installation  O&M funds. (T-1) 1.3.11.10.  Parent unit commanders/First Sergeants or their appointees in the grade of E-7 / GS-9 or higher may visit confinees at any time (official visit). There are no restrictions on official visits as long as they do not interrupt normal facility operations (e.g., meals, medication calls, etc.). (T-1) 1.3.11.11.  The parent unit commander ensures a confinee has all required clothing upon entry into confinement, based upon the facility weather and climate requirements. Unless otherwise  prescribed  in  a  transfer  order,  confinees  arrive  with  the  following  minimum requirements:  one  complete  set  of  service  dress  (with  light  blue  shirt  and  tie/tab),  four complete  sets  of  ABUs,  one  APEX,  one  pair  of  boots,  one  pair  of  low  quarter  shoes, appropriate  belts,  headgear,  undergarments,  socks,  and  one  set  of  AF  PTU  (or  Service equivalent) and athletic shoes. Shower shoes are optional. The confinement NCO stores excess items not needed for daily use (e.g., Service Dress items including tie/tab and low quarter  shoes).  The  parent  unit  provides  missing  or  unserviceable  items  prior  to confinement or transfer. (T-1) 1.3.11.12.  The parent unit assists in the disposition of unauthorized personal property in concert with the inmate’s preferences, as appropriate. Corrections staff members use AF Form 807, Receipt-Inmate’s Personal Property, to document personal property and file in CTF. (T-1) 1.3.11.13.  Prior  to  transfer,  the  losing  commander  provides  documents  relating  to security clearance suspension or withdrawal for inclusion in the CTF. (T-0) 1.3.11.14.  The parent  unit ensures appropriate dependent  ID  cards  are issued according to  AFI  36-3026  (I),  Identification  Cards  for  Members  of  the  Uniformed  Services,  Their Eligible  Family  Members,  and  Other  Eligible  Personnel.  Dependent  ID  cards  may possibly be confiscated depending upon the orders of the courts-martial. (T-1) 1.3.11.15.  Parent unit responsibilities concerning transfers are discussed at a pre-transfer conference  arranged  by  the  confinement  officer/NCO  with  the  confinee  and  their commander, or appointed representative, to explain the requirements of the transfer and resolve  the  disposition  of  property  and  funds.  The  pre-transfer  conference  discussion includes  the  following  parent  unit  responsibilities:  NOTE:  Geographically  separated parent units may attend via telephone conference line. (T-0) 16 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 1.3.11.15.1.  The  parent  unit  assists  in  document  preparation  as  necessary  for command  sponsored  dependent  travel  authorization  on  ERD  (Early  Return  of Dependents)  orders  for  CONUS  (JTR  U5240-F;  1-6)/OCONUS  (JTR  U5900-D,  2h, 1-9) travel. (T-0) 1.3.11.15.2.  Command  sponsored  dependents  may  ship  household  goods  CONUS (JTR  U5370-H;  1-2)  OCONUS  (U5900,  D2h8;  Note  1:  ICW  early  return  of dependents). (T-0) 1.3.11.15.3.  Parent unit ensures shipment of household goods for single and divorced members  is  conducted  IAW  the  most  current  JTR  to  determine  entitlements  to ship/store household goods and personal property at government expense. (T-0) 1.3.11.15.4.  The parent unit ensures installation out-processing is completed prior to the transfer, as  well as  receives  and discusses  clothing and  administrative checklists from confinement officer/NCO. (T-0) 1.3.11.15.5.  The  parent  unit  provides  resources  (funding  and  escort  support) consistent  with  custody  classification  and  security  requirements.  All  confinees  are escorted, regardless of previous status/rank. (T-0) 1.3.11.16.  Parent  unit’s  personnel  office  is  responsible  for  submitting  the  proper documentation to the FSO to place member on excess leave (appellate leave). (T-1) 1.3.11.17.  Ensure government transportation is provided in accordance with JTR. (T-0) 1.3.11.18.  For  ease  of  administration,  the  installation  commander  may  wish  to consolidate  any  or  all  issues  concerning  funding  from  the  squadron  level  to  the installation level. (T-3) 1.3.12.  The  DFC  appoints  a  commissioned  officer,  in  writing,  as  the  confinement  officer. This  position  is  usually  the  unit  Operations  Officer/S3.  The  confinement  NCO  is operationally responsible to the confinement officer and no lower than an E-4. (T-1) 1.3.12.1.  NOTE:  Due  to  the  complexity  of  compliance  criteria  associated  with confinement operations and management highly recommend the confinement NCO be at least an E-5 or E-5 select. 1.3.12.1.1.  The  DFC  ensures  compliance  with  the  corrections  system  guidelines  in this instruction. They may restore all or part of previously forfeited or withheld Good Conduct  Time  (GCT),  Earned  Time  (ET),  or  Special  Acts  Abatement  (SAA), including time withheld or forfeited at other facilities, as applicable. (T-0) 1.3.12.2.  The  DFC  reports  all  allegations  of  sexual  abuse  or  sexual  harassment associated with the confinement facility to the Air Force Office of Special  Investigation (AFOSI). The AFOSI determines if the case falls under the current Air Force purview for investigation.  If  the  AFOSI  declines,  then  the  Security  Forces  Investigation  (SFI)  staff works the case(s). Should the DFC become aware of sexual abuse or sexual harassment at another  confinement  facility  they  follow  notification  procedures  listed  in  paragraph 2.6.2.16. (T-0) 1.3.12.2.1.  The DFC designates a facility PREA compliance manager with sufficient time and authority to coordinate the facilities efforts to comply under PREA. (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 17 1.3.12.2.1.1.  NOTE  1:  Suggest  STAN-EVAL  staff  member  (not  NCOIC)  is  in the best position for this designation. 1.3.12.2.1.2.  NOTE 2:  The facility level PREA compliance manager follows the administrative lead of the Air Force level PREA compliance coordinator in order to share information and effort to ensure satisfactory inspection compliance. 1.3.12.2.2.  The DFC ensures a Sexual Abuse Incident Review is conducted upon the completion of the law enforcement investigation, unless the investigation determines the report to be unfounded. DFC uses the information from this review to improve the effectiveness  of  the  confinement  facility’s  prevention,  detection,  and  response policies,  practices,  and  training.  To  provide  timely  staff  reaction  and  response ordinarily this review should begin no later than 30 days after the incident is reported and  include  input  from  supervisors,  investigators,  and  medical  and  mental  health practitioners.  Consider  if  demographics  were  relevant  motives.  Provide  report  and recommendations  to  the  DFC  for  approval.  Forward  DFC  decisions  to  the  AF  level PREA  compliance  coordinator  who  shares  approved  recommendations  and justifications  for  non-approved  recommendations  for  AF,  and  possibly  DoD  wide, cross flow. (T-0) 1.3.12.2.2.1.  NOTE:  Suggest  DFC  appoints  STAN-EVAL  NCOIC  (who  is  not the PREA compliance manager) to conduct review. 1.3.12.2.3.  The DFC, or designated SNCO or above on non-duty days, conducts daily documented visits to confinees in disciplinary segregation. (T-0) 1.3.13.  The  confinement  officer  ensures  proper  custody,  control,  administration,  and correctional treatment using this instruction, DoDI 1325.07, DoDD 1325.04, and applicable laws. The confinement officer develops an operating instruction (OI) to ensure uniform daily operation of the facility. The OI should be sufficiently detailed to assist staff in completing assigned  tasks.  Further,  include  actions  for  response  to  incidents  of  sexual  abuse  such  as; separating  of  belligerents,  separating  abusers  and  victims,  as  well  as,  manner/method  of notifying, investigators, medical/mental health practitioners, and facility leadership.(T-0) 1.3.13.1.  The confinement officer ensures procedures are established for those who elect to protect their rights of under the Victims and Witnesses Assistance Program via use of the DD Form 2704. (T-0) 1.3.13.2.  The  confinement  officer  establishes  an  issue  stock  of  H&C  items.  (See Attachment  3  for  listing  of  H&C  items.)  As  a  minimum,  provide  items  for  personal hygiene.  Confinees  in  a  non-pay  status  are  provided  H&C  items  and  haircuts  at government  expense.  (See  paragraph  1.3.11.9.)  Confinees  in  a  pay  status  are  charged against their pay accounts or from their personal funds for items and haircuts.

The confinement officer, after consultation with SJA, releases pretrial detainees upon  written  order  of  an  authorized  official  (i.e.,  confining  official),  to  a  representative from their parent unit. (T-0) 18 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 1.3.13.3.1.  NOTE:  Refer  to  Chapter  5  of  this  instruction  for  more  detailed information. 1.3.13.4.  The  confinement  officer  provides  a  cash  donation  not  to  exceed  $25,  IAW DoDI  7000.14-R,  Financial  Management  Regulation,  Volume  7A,  Chapter  35,  Table 35-11  (Military  Pay  Policy  and  Procedures  Active  Duty  and  Reserve  Pay),  for  inmates released upon expiration of sentence with a punitive discharge (regardless if the discharge is  executed  or  not),  or  on  parole/MSR  or  appellate  review  leave.  The  DoDI  allows  this gratuity only for inmates who were enlisted. There is  no gratuity  for inmates who were officers. (T-0) 1.3.13.5.  The  confinement  officer  ensures  a  list  of  rules  (Facility  Rules  Book)  is provided (and receipted) to each confinee which includes as a minimum: information on the complaint system; procedures for how to request official calls or visits with a defense attorney,  chaplain,  First  Sergeant,  etc.;  prescribed  visitation  hours;  H&C  requisition procedures;  sick  call  procedures;  anticipated  daily/weekend/holiday  schedules;  list  of facility  offenses  (rules  violations)  and,  discipline  and  control  measures;  and  other information  deemed  necessary.  Rules  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum  necessary  and  be positive in nature. Confinees are not to be tested on this information. (T-0) 1.3.13.5.1.  NOTE:  See Attachment 4 for list of Facility Offenses. 1.3.14.  Confinee  is  responsible  for  their  travel  expenses,  including  escorts,  related  for approved Emergency Parole (EP). Number of escorts is determined by custody classification. Refer to paragraph 12.23 for more details on EP. (T-1) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 19 Chapter 2 FACILITY FUNCTIONS AND CONFINEE MANAGEMENT 2.1.  Managing  Confinement  Facilities  and  Holding/Detention  Cell  Operations  :  For  the purposes of this instruction, all AF confinement facilities (excluding holding and detention cells) conduct reporting IAW DIBRS/NIBRS case reporting and the DoD Annual Confinement Report. All  AF  confinement  facilities  (including  holding  and  detention  cells)  are  considered  Level  I facilities  for  compliance  of  all  other  administrative,  training,  operational  reasons  including Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). (T-0) 2.1.1.  Establishing,  Closing,  or  Changing  Designation  of  Confinement  Facilities  or  Cells. Because  of  the  joint  nature  of  military  confinement/corrections,  any  installation  changes  in status (confinement facility or detention cells), or renovations of an existing facility or cell, must be coordinated/approved by AFSFC/SFC. This is to maintain single manager oversight and if necessary, present as appropriate to the DoD Corrections Council or to OUSD (P&R), as appropriate, for approval. Send requests to AFSFC/SFC, 1517 Billy Mitchell Blvd, JBSA Lackland TX 78236-0119; or email: all.afsfc.sfc@us.af.mil. (T-0) 2.1.1.1.  When  establishing  a  facility,  designing  or  re-designing  cell  capability,  contact AFSFC/SFC  for  expertise  and  guidance.  AFSFC/SFC  has  access  to  the  American Correctional Association’s Planning and Design Guides with subsequent editions and can assist  in  coordination  with  the  AF  Civil  Engineering  Center’s  Building  Information Modeling  (BIM)  standard  for  SF  infrastructure  to  ensure  it  meets  the  most  current correctional guidelines for incarceration. (T-0) 2.1.1.2.  Closing  Installation  Confinement  Facilities.  For  facilities  that  routinely  house multi-Service confinees, the closure request is staffed IAW DoDD 1325.04, through the chain up to OUSD (P&R) for a decision. The DoDD requires requests be made 60-days in advance in order to properly coordinate and decide (include 30-days additional time so it may be staffed inside the AF before going to DoD). (T-0)  2.1.1.3.  For  facilities  that  do  not  routinely  house  multi-Service  confinees  the  closure request  is  staffed  from  the  installation  through  their  chain  to  AFSFC/SFC  for  a recommendation and then up to the DCS level (AF/A4, DCS Logistics, Installations and Mission Support) for a decision. (T-1) 2.1.1.3.1.  NOTE  : However, for example, if severe storm damage causes occupancy issues;  the  wellbeing  of  confinees/staff  is  paramount.  Closure  may  be  necessary  in advance  of  coordination/notification.  In  these  unique  situations,  AFSFC/SFC  will seek to expedite the process. 2.1.1.4.  As part of the staffing process to the DCS, it may be necessary for AFSFC/SFC to  present  it  to  the  DoD  Corrections  Council  for  a  recommendation  because  of  the interconnectivity of all levels of DoD corrections facilities. Requests to close an existing facility,  except  situations involving  safety,  security,  health,  and  wellbeing  of confinee/staff, or emergency conditions, should be well reasoned. At a minimum, either circumstance (multi-Service or single Service facility) should be staffed to AFSFC/SFC for comment at least 90 days before a decision is desired. (T-1) 20 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 2.1.1.4.1.  NOTE  : However, for example, if severe storm damage causes occupancy issues;  the  wellbeing  of  confinees/staff  is  paramount.  Closure  may  be  necessary  in advance  of  coordination/notification.  In  these  unique  situations,  AFSFC/SFC  will seek to expedite the process. 2.1.2.  Confinement Facility (CF). A CF provides the following (as a minimum): one or more beds  with  toilet/sink  in  cell,  segregation  cell(s),  a  day  room,  shower,  recreation  yard, washer/dryer within the secure area of the operation, an administrative room, storage  room, and means to prevent escape. (T-0) 2.1.2.1.  NOTE:  DoDI 1325.07 requires Level I Facilities to have a minimum of 5% of segregation  cells.  Due  to  the  fact  that  Level  I  Facilities  often  include  confinees  of  both genders,  AFSFC/SFC  highly  recommends  at  least  two  cells  be  able  to  be  converted  to meet segregation standards. When segregation needs are not required, it is permissible (if physically possible on short notice) to convert the cell back to non-segregation standard and vice versa. 2.1.3.  Holding  Cell  designation.  A  cell  not  equipped  with  a  toilet/sink,  but  the  fixtures  are available in the building under escort, is considered a Holding Cell. Optimally, this cell holds individuals  up enforcement operations/investigations.  The  DFC  can  for  good  cause,  after  consultation  with  the  SJA, extend  the  8-hour  time  limit.  This  cell  is  a  temporary  solution  and  should  never  exceed  24 hours.  Specifications  for  this  cell  are  the  same  as  a  CF  cell,  minus  the  fixtures  and  the laundry/shower, day room, and recreation yard as part of the physical plant. (T-1) to  8-hours.  Normally, support these cells law 2.1.3.1.  NOTE:  Do  not  co-mingle  in  any  manner  pretrial  detainees  with  post-trial inmates or with  individuals  detained for law enforcement processing (i.e., DUI  suspect, etc.). 2.1.4.  Detention  Cell  designation.  A  cell  equipped  with  a  toilet/sink  is  considered  a Detention  Cell.  Optimally,  this  cell  holds  individuals  for  up  to  72-hours.  Normally,  these cells are used as a staging location for pretrial detainees or post-trial inmates while awaiting transfer  to  an  appropriate  confinement/correctional  facility.  The  lack  of  a  collocated laundry/shower and recreation yard make this more than a temporary solution but less than a permanent solution. The DFC can for good cause, after consultation with the SJA, extend the time  limit  to  the  absolute  minimum  time  necessary  to  facilitate  the  earliest  opportunity  for transfer. Specifications for this cell are the same as a CF cell, minus the laundry/shower, day room,  and  recreation  yard  as  part  of  the  physical  plant.  The  DFC  ensures  non-athletic recreation  and  hygiene  arrangements  are  made  (e.g.,  use  of  another  appropriate  facility  for showers/laundry), even if manpower intensive. (T-1) 2.1.5.  Closing Detention or Holding Cells. To close a detention or holding cell, first consult with AFSFC/SFC to determine possible effects on the DoD community  (T-1) and then seek approval as determined by the installation chain of command. 2.2.  Confinement  Facility  (CF)  Requirements.  New construction or modification  of existing structures  for  incarceration  purposes  will  be  based  upon  approved  designs  IAW  applicable federal  building  codes  for  penal  institutions.  NOTE:  For  new  construction,  build  CFs  vice detention  and  holding  cells  because  while  construction  cost  is  nearly  identical,  the  costs  for operations and manpower is almost always lower with CFs. (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 21 2.2.1.  New  AF  CFs  should  be  located  away  from  (as  determined  by  the  DFC)  installation perimeter  fences,  childcare  facilities/schools,  public  thoroughfares,  gates,  swimming  pools, base exchanges, theaters, family housing, Airmen billets, service clubs, open messes, foliage or wooded areas, active flight lines, or firing ranges. (T-3) 2.3.  Confinement Staff. 2.3.1.  Know  and  adhere  to  use-of-force  policies  established  in  applicable  DoD  and  AF directives.  Include  policy  application  and  training  of  special  restraint  devices  unique  to confinement in local training in concert with the SF unit training branch. (T-0) 2.3.2.  Act  in  accordance  with  all  the  requirements  of  the  UCMJ  and  observe  the constitutional aspects  of  behavior  by confinement/corrections  staff  members  merit  special  emphasis  and  the  DFC  immediately reviews any violations: (T-0) individuals.  The rights  of following 2.3.2.1.  Personal  dignity  of  all  individuals  is  to  be  observed  and  any  act  or  work assignment that demeans, degrades, humiliates, or serves only to embarrass a confinee is expressly prohibited. (T-0) 2.3.2.2.  Striking or laying hands upon confinees is prohibited by staff members except in self-defense,  to  prevent  serious  injury  to  self  or  others,  to  prevent  serious  damage  to property,  to  effect  an  authorized  search,  or  to  quell  a  disturbance.  In  such  cases,  the amount of force used will be the minimum amount necessary to bring the situation under control. (T-0) 2.3.2.3.  Physical  abuse,  hazing,  use  of  unnecessary  force,  and  any  form  of  corporal punishment by a staff member are prohibited. (T-0) 2.3.2.3.1.  Using  provoking  speech,  inflammatory  profanity,  in-your-face  yelling,  or purposeful demeaning language is prohibited. (T-0) 2.3.2.3.1.1.  NOTE:  Such language and staff behavior is counter-productive in a corrections environment. Being  a firm  staff member  does not  equal  a combative staff  attitude.  Choose  words  and  delivery  of  language  to  maintain  order  and discipline. Say what you mean and mean what you say, calmly. 2.3.2.4.  Staff  members  are  prohibited  from  bartering,  giving,  or  selling  any  item  or service to confinees and are prohibited from permitting others to conduct such activities. (T-0) 2.3.2.5.  Staff members are prohibited from extending privileges, favored assignments, or information  to  individual  confinees  that  are  not  similarly  available  to  all  in  the  same custody classification/status. (T-0) 2.3.2.6.  Staff  members  are  prohibited  from  using  their  official  position  to  establish  or maintain social contacts or relationships with confinees, their families, or friends. (T-0) 2.3.2.7.  Staff members are prohibited from releasing information on individual confinees without the authorization of the confinement officer. (T-0) 2.3.2.8.  Staff  members  who  set  high  personal  standards  of  appearance  and  military bearing generally have better behaved confinees. Be fair, firm, and consistent. 22 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 2.3.2.9.  Staff  members  are  prohibited  from  fraternizing  with  confinees  or  engaging  in sexual  acts/contact  of  any  kind.  These  restrictions  do  not  prohibit  all  contact,  such  as exchange of routine social pleasantries between confinees and staff members. (T-0) 2.3.2.9.1.  Confinees  cannot  consent  to  sexual  acts/contact  of  any  kind  with  staff members, nor  can confinees consent  to  sexual  acts/contact  of any  kind  with  another confinee. (T-0) 2.3.2.9.2.  Staff  members  are  required  to  enforce  the  prohibition  against  confinees having sexual acts/contact of any kind with other confinees. (T-0) 2.3.2.9.3.  Invasion  of  privacy  of  a  confinee  showering  or  performing  bodily functions  by  staff,  unrelated  to  official  duties,  or  any  form  of  voyeurism  by  staff  is prohibited. Such viewing incidental to routine cell checks is considered official duty. Initial or subsequent strip searches for cause are considered official duties. If related to maintaining constant observation under suicide watch use same gender staff. (T-0) 2.3.2.9.4.  Staff may not search or physically examine a confinee under PREA for the sole  purpose  of  determining  gender.  If  in  question,  use  established  medical  or personnel records for answer or, seek determination from a medical practitioner. (T-0) 2.3.2.10.  Sexual  abuse  and  harassment  are  prohibited.  This  behavior  interferes  with individual  performance  and  creates  an  intimidating,  hostile,  and  offensive  environment. Whether  a  detainee,  inmate,  or  staff  member;  sexual  abuse  and  harassment  denies  the individual respect and dignity. It is contrary to the mission. (T-0) 2.3.3.  Ensure  accessibility  to  training,  treatment,  and  transition  programs  to  promote opportunities for rehabilitating inmates for their post-trial return to society or return to duty. Providing  meaningful  work  and  opportunities  for  personal  improvement  is  the  keystone  to successful CF operations. (T-0) 2.4.  Staff Manpower and Qualifications.  Unless otherwise directed by higher headquarters or appropriate  documents  affecting  manpower  (e.g.,  Program  Action  Directives,  etc.)  staffing  for installation  confinement  (Level  I)  facilities  is  documented  in  an  AF-approved  manpower standard.  Each  SF  unit  earns  a  Confinement  Program  billet  in  accordance  with  the  SF Capabilities-based  Manpower  Standard,  CMS  43SXXX.  MAJCOMS  may  determine  additional staffing  requirements  for  Level  I  facilities.  AFSFC  determines  AF  manpower  (i.e.,  staff) assigned to Level II and Level III facilities. (T-1) 2.4.1.  Staff members who do not  possess a high degree of maturity and  emotional stability are generally unsuccessful in a corrections environment. The DFC is highly encouraged not to assign staff members who are less than an E-4 and do not hold a 5-skill level. 2.4.1.1.  Historically, confinees who were formally of a higher rank attempt to  use their years of AF knowledge to their benefit over less experienced staff members. Prevention is  best  when  DFCs  are  highly  selective  of  staff  members  seeking  those  who  are emotionally and intellectually mature. 2.4.1.2.  For personnel to work as confinement staff members or augmentees, IAW DoDI 1325.07, they must, 1) possess a high degree of maturity and emotional stability, and 2) have no civilian felony convictions or court-martial convictions for any offense for which AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 23 a maximum authorized sentence to confinement exceeds 1 year, whether or not adjudged to be in excess of 1 year. (T-0) 2.4.1.2.1.  Confinement  staff  members,  escorts  or  augmentees  cannot  have  an  active Unfavorable  Information  File  (UIF)  (T-1)  Additionally,  they  must  self-disclose  any information that involves legal misconduct to the facility’s supervisory chain. (T-0) 2.4.1.2.2.  Personnel  other  than  3P0X1,  used  to  supervise,  escort,  and/or  guard confinees  must  be  properly  trained  (and  documented)  in  the  following  areas  as  a minimum:  frisk  search,  vehicle  search  (as  it  relates  to  transportation  of  confinees) cuffing, release and escort procedures, including actions for travel routes, escape, and illness. (T-1) 2.4.1.2.3.  If Level I confinement staff are tasked with additional duties not in support of the facility, those duties should not  degrade or otherwise compromise  security of the facility. (T-1) 2.4.1.3.  When  determining  staffing  manpower,  staff  of  the  opposite  gender  may supervise  or  guard  confinees’  activities  in  the  facility.  However,  pursuant  to  42  USC §§15601-15609,  aka  Prison  Rape  Elimination  Act  (PREA),  this  arrangement  must  not result in undue viewing or invasion of confinee privacy (e.g., hygiene, dressing, etc.), or viewing  of  the  breasts,  buttocks,  or  genitalia,  except  in  exigent  circumstances  or  when such  viewing  is  incidental  to  routine  cell  checks.  Strip  and  frisk  searches  of  confinees must be conducted by same gender staff except in exigent circumstances. Cavity searches of anal or genital openings will be done by a medical practitioner. NOTE: The Air Force considers undue viewing of the opposite gender to include viewing on CCTV monitors. Since CCTV is not authorized in the shower or toilet areas, the intention of the Air Force is that CCTV use in segregation or suicide watch cells will be monitored by same gender staff.  (If  the  cell  can  be  converted  from  segregation  cell  to  general  population  cell,  the camera lens must be capped.) (T-0) 2.4.1.3.1.  Under  PREA,  DFC  conducts  an  annual  review  of  the  staffing  plan (manpower), CCTV plan, and policy of documented (blotter) on-duty/off-duty higher level unannounced supervisory visits. DFC includes this information in a brief signed letter along with the Annual Confinement Report.(T-0) 2.4.1.4.  Any  qualified  3P0X1  (usually  personnel  assigned  to  flight)  trained  in  escort procedures may be used as an escort outside the facility. Use a same gender escort. (T-0) 2.4.1.4.1.  When  two  or  more  escorts  are  required,  due  to  custody  classification  or number of confinees, at least one escort must be the same gender. (T-0) 2.4.1.4.2.  If an emergency situation occurs in the facility or during an escort mission, e.g., involving escape or a life or death medical situation; the first action is to resolve the  situation,  the  second  action  is  to  ensure  proper  staff/escort  gender  requirements. (T-0) 2.5.  Incident  Reporting.  Incident reports include, but  are not  limited to:  allegations of sexual harassment,  allegations  of  abuse  (sexual  or  otherwise),  disturbances  with  injury  or  significant property damage, escape, or death of a confinee. (T-0)  24 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 2.5.1.  As soon as the situation permits, the confinement officer or NCO reports any serious or significant incidents to their chain of command, up to and including AFSFC/SFC. During non-duty  hours,  notify  the  AFSFC/OPS  Center  at  1-877-273-3098.  In  turn,  AFSFC/SFC ensures AFSFC/CC and the appropriate chain is notified. (T-1) 2.5.1.1.  Sexual  assault  or  sexual  harassment  allegations  will  be  referred  for  criminal investigation  to  AFOSI  or  another  criminal  investigative  agency  as  AFOSI  determines and  are  not  considered  administrative  investigations.  The  facility  separates  accuser  and accused pending resolution. (T-1) 2.5.1.1.1.  Following  sexual  crime  protocol,  the  investigating  agency  provides confinee  with  access  as  appropriate  to  a  forensic  medical  examination  preformed, where possible, by a Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner (SAFE) or a Sexual Assault Nurse  Examiner  (SANE),  as  part  of  evidence  gathering.  If  SAFE  or  SANE examinations  are  not  possible,  then  document  the  effort  and  obtain  other  qualified medical practitioner(s) for evidence gathering. Ensure sexual abuse, rape crisis victim advocate  and/or  mental  health  care  access  options,  as  appropriate,  are  made  readily available and that support protocols are followed. Sexual abuse confinee victims are informed  by  the  facility  of  the  result  of  the  investigation  either;  substantiated, unsubstantiated, or unfounded and document all notifications in the CTF. (T-0) 2.5.1.1.2.  If  a  staff  member  is  the  accused  (unless  the  allegation  is  unfounded)  the facility  informs  the  accuser  when;  the  staff  member  is  no  longer  posted  in  the confinement  facility  or  housing  unit  (AFSFC  facilities  are  not  sub-divided  into housing  units  which  is  more  common  at  larger  facilities),  and/or  a  charge  is  made against  the  staff  member  relative  to  this  sexual  abuse  allegation  and  documents  all notifications in the CTF. (T-0) 2.5.1.1.3.  If another confinee is the accused the facility informs the accuser when the accused  has  been  charged  and  results  of  the  trial  relative  to  this  sexual  abuse allegation. The facility’s obligation to report this information under PREA terminates if the accused is transferred/released from the facility. (T-0) is to  report it to independently  responsible 2.5.1.2.  Grievance  reporting  by  confinees.  Ensure  the  Facilities  Rules  Book  instructs confinees  how  to  report  grievances.  Confinees  may  tell  a  staff  member  verbally,  or signed  or  anonymously  in  writing.  (The  staff  member  receiving  a  grievance  from  a confinee the  proper  office  for review/investigation  with  all  sexual  abuse  and  sexual  harassment  grievances  being initially  referred  to  AFOSI.)  Confinees  may  use  their  privileged  communication (telephone/mail)  options  as  one  method.  They  may  also  use  in  person  communication with legal, pastoral or medical staff during scheduled appointments. However, to reduce delays and still maintain privacy, additional methods are  necessary. Facilities will make available  a  direct  dial  only  non-recorded/monitored  phone  (suggest  placing  in  the  day room). As a minimum link this phone to the installation SAPRO, the DoD Safe Helpline (1-877-995-5247),  installation  Chaplain,  ADC  and  local  time/weather  recording.  (Other direct lines can be added as locally deemed necessary.) The object is to provide discreet multiple  authorized  direct  connections  so  that  an  observer  cannot  assume  to  whom  the call is being placed. In cases of reporting sexual abuse or sexual harassment the response AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 25 time  is  paramount.  NOTE:  Occasionally  test  (determine  frequency  conditions  locally) each line on the direct phone and logging the tests in the blotter. (T-0). 2.5.1.2.1.  Staff also accepts reports from third parties. A third party report cannot go forward unless the suspected abused/harassed confinee agrees to pursue the grievance (this prevents repeated erroneous allegations made to purposefully distract the staff). (T-0) 2.5.1.2.2.  Should it be determined (via investigation) confinees have filed grievances (including sexual abuse or sexual harassment under PREA) in bad faith, the facility is authorized to consider administrative discipline (see discipline and adjustment board). (T-0) 2.5.2.  Disciplinary  actions  taken  for  any  staff  member  are  IAW  Air  Force  policy,  DoD policy, military law and the UCMJ. (T-0) 2.5.3.  Promptly forward all incident reports, investigation reports and sexual abuse incident reviews  to  AFSFC/SFC  to  provide  the  data  necessary  to  complete  various  Air  Force  level annual reports for the Department of Justice, e.g., the Survey of Sexual Violence, et.al. (T-0) 2.5.4.  For  AFSFC/SFC  to  communicate  immediate  information,  it  benefits  CFs  to  obtain  a facility  workflow  email  address  (check  with  your  Communications  Squadron)  in  the following  suggested  format:  basenameconfinement@basename.af.mil.  Individual  facility staffs  change  over  time  however,  use  of  an  org  email  address  to  ensures  communications link. AFSFC also has org email addresses which are referenced in the appropriate paragraphs of the instruction. (T-3) 2.6.  Level  I  Staff  Training  Requirements.  Minimal required Level  I staff training standards, for the Air Force, as per DoDI 1325.07, Enclosure 2, Paragraph 14.a.(1). (T-0) 2.6.1.  Confinement  officers  and  confinement  NCOs,  with  or  without  organic  facilities, establish  a  structured  training  program  in  conjunction  with  the  SF  unit  training  section tailored to meet the local mission needs. 2.6.1.1.  Installations  with  or  without  confinement  facilities  designate  confinement  staff positions  as  critical  duty  and  Airmen  are  certified  upon  satisfactorily  completing  a confinement Duty Position Evaluation (DPE) by STAN-EVAL. (T-1) training/DPE is  still  necessary 2.6.1.1.1.  NOTE:  Even  if  the  installation  doesn’t  have  an  organic  confinement facility,  staff to  properly  conduct  post-trial documentations.  Further,  staffing  and  training/DPE  the  appropriate  number  of  male and female transfer team personnel is  necessary in order to  conduct  armed/unarmed transfer missions to appropriate facilities. For example, installations without a facility are likely to conduct a higher number of local/non-local transfer missions and should take notice to be proficient in those administrative and physical aspects. See AFM 31-127,  Security  Forces  Armed/Unarmed  Transfer  Team  Procedures  for  additional information. 2.6.1.2.  Units  design  staff  training  programs  unique  to  their  confinement  situation (organic  or  non-organic  facility)  to  ensure  all  personnel  assigned  duties  associated  with confinement  are  fully  trained.  As  a  minimum  include  training  and  subsequent  STAN-EVALS  for  staff  assigned  to  a  facility  on;  custody,  escort  procedures,  proper  use  of 26 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 suicide  prevention, administrative  management,  VWAP, restraining  devices, management/observation/administration offender registration/notification  requirements,  and  sexual  abuse  prevention/detection/reporting. Ensure training is current in safety, Self-Aid/Buddy Care, Adult CPR, and use of AED. (T-1) sex of  medication calls, 2.6.1.3.  Trainers document and maintain entries in Air Force Training Records (AFTR) system. For others, including 3P0X1 personnel performing escort duties, ensure training covers the areas as stated in paragraph 2.4.1.2. (T-1) 2.6.1.4.  Confinement  NCOs  possess  or  must  complete  one  of  the  following  courses within 6 months of duty assignment: the AF Corrections Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL),  any  Service’s  in-residence  or  correspondence  corrections  course  (i.e.,  Navy Corrections  course);  or  complete  an  American  Correctional  Association  (ACA) Correctional Officer correspondence course for guards. (T-0) 2.6.1.4.1.  NOTE:  It  is  highly  recommended  all  personnel  performing  correctional duties  be  afforded  the  opportunity  to  complete  continuation  training  (i.e.,  ACA Correctional Officer/Supervisor/Mid-Manager correspondence courses, etc.). 2.6.2.  Initial  and  recurring  corrections  staff  training  programs.  Units  with  organic  facilities complete  paragraphs  2.6.2.1.  to  2.6.2.18.,  as  a  minimum.  Units  without  an  organic  facility complete  paragraphs  2.  2.6.2.3. to  2.6.2.18.,  as  a  minimum.  DoD  and  Federal confinement/corrections  standards  require  refresher  training  be  accomplished  at  least  every two  years,  however,  passing  a  confinement  STAN-EVAL  resets  the  two  year  time requirement. (T-0) 2.6.2.1.  Know  the  mission,  purpose,  and  objective  of  the  facility  as  prescribed  in  the facility OI. (T-0) 2.6.2.2.  Know  emergency  action  plans  for  fire,  natural  disaster,  escapes,  disturbances, injuries, or illness. (T-0) 2.6.2.2.1.  NOTE:  See Attachment 5 for a template list of emergency actions. 2.6.2.3.  Thorough  familiarity  with  the  rules  of  detainee/inmate  conduct,  discipline  and control measures available to the staff (paragraph 8.7.), and the rationale for the rules. (T-0) 2.6.2.4.  Understand suicide prevention. Detailed suicide prevention plans should address each  of  the  following:  training,  identification,  communication,  intervention,  reporting, follow-up, and review. (T-0) 2.6.2.5.  Understand the staff/confinee professional relationship. (T-0) 2.6.2.6.  Know use of force and weapons restrictions. (T-0) 2.6.2.7.  Know escort responsibilities and custody classification requirements. (T-0) 2.6.2.8.  Know  administration,  to  include  Privacy  Act  confidentiality  of  confinee information. (T-0) 2.6.2.9.  Understand  the  general  function  and  relationship  of  referral  agencies  to  the confinement mission (i.e., legal, clinic, mental health, finance, etc.). (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 27 2.6.2.10.  Know Victim/Witness, DNA, and sex offender requirements. (T-0) 2.6.2.11.  Know evidence and property handling. (T-0) 2.6.2.12.  Know Area, Vehicle, and Person Searches as related to confinement. 2.6.2.12.1.  Area  Searches.  Concentric  circle  (spiral)  search  is  often  used  in  rooms, buildings,  and  small  outdoor  areas.  Perform  this  search  by  proceeding  in  ever widening  or  ever  narrowing  circles,  in  a  systematic  clockwise  or  counterclockwise manner.  NOTE:  For  additional  information  see  the  most  current  SF  Career Development Course (CDCs) on searching. (T-1) 2.6.2.12.1.1.  Area Searches are most often used for the cell, the day room or any other  common  access  room  such  as:  the  shower  area  or  recreational  yard. Concentrate the searches looking for items that are usually small and may initially appear as harmless. Look under desks, tables, and mattresses. Look in vents. Look at tops of doors, including the door jam. Include visual inspection of common use items  such  as;  removing  the  caps  of  shaving  cream  or  inspecting  the  battery compartment  of  a  Day  Room  television  remote.  Leafing  through  magazines  or books  (including  religious  books  which  are  to  be  treated  with  respect)  upside down looking for hidden papers or other contraband. Items in this type of search may  be;  handwritten  notes,  currency  (paper  or  coin),  tools  (including  eating utensils), weapons (e.g., razor embedded into the plastic of a toothbrush, comb or brush) or anything that is out of place in a confinement environment. Search the visitation  room  before  and  after  any  visitation,  even  non-threatening  visits  such as; command, legal or chaplain. Visits can be dangerous if the confinee can find a weapon  to  use  beforehand  or,  if  the  official  visitor  should  accidently  leave  or misplace an item upon departure. If anything suspicious is found, on any search, notify  the  on-call  SF  Investigator  for  assistance  in  securing  the  evidence  and  to begin investigation to determine identity of “owner” and item’s source. (T-1) 2.6.2.12.2.  Vehicle  Searches  of  the  seat  location(s)  to  be  used  by  a  confinee  are necessary  before  and  after  transportation.  This  prevents  the  access  to  contraband previously  left  in  the  vehicle  (e.g.,  SF  member’s  personal  pocket  knife  accidently fallen out of a pocket) and ensures removal of any contraband left behind or disposed of by the confinee. (T-1) 2.6.2.12.2.1.  NOTE:  For  additional  information  see  the  most  current  SF  CDCs on searching. 2.6.2.12.3.  Person Searches. Use the technique most relevant to the situation at hand; either  a  standing  or  prone  search.  Person  Searches  are  necessary  to  prevent  the removal of items  from  the facility or the introduction of contraband into the facility by  use  of  a  frisk  search.  Use  same  gender  for  frisk  searches  unless  in  exigent circumstances.  Even  in  same  gender  frisk  search,  it  is  a  safety  best  practice  to  have another  same  gender  person  to  observe.  Only  medical  authorities  can  conduct invasive  body  cavity  searches;  however,  staff  can  request  to  view  into  an  open  the mouth, e.g., prevent hiding something or to ensure a pill was swallowed. NOTE: For additional information see the most current SF CDCs on searching. However, PREA standards are usually more strict than SF standards, use the stricter standard. (T-0) 28 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 2.6.2.12.3.1.  Person  Searches  are  always  conducted  when  confinees  depart  the facility  and  conducted  when  confinees  return  to  the  facility  if  the  confinee  has been  escorted  by  someone  other  than  a  SF  member.  Recommend  conducting random  person  searches  upon  return  to  the  facility  even  when  the  escort  was entirely performed by a SF member. The person being searched keeps all clothing on except cold weather gear and hats. (Search cold weather gear as well.) Check under  hats  and  check  long  hair  on  females.  For  all  during  the  frisk;  physically check  waistbands,  groin  areas  and  sides  of  boots  looking  for  contraband.  Also inspect  any  materials  (e.g.,  leaf  through  notebooks  looking  for  contraband).  For females  during  the  frisk;  physically  check  the  bra  straps  and  the  space  between the bra cups. (T-0) 2.6.2.13.  Know  Cardio-Pulmonary  Resuscitation  (CPR),  First  Aid  procedures,  and disposal of contaminated First Aid materials. (T-0) 2.6.2.14.  Know process for decontaminating material, cells, and other spaces when blood or other bodily fluids are present. AFSFC/SFCT has a video series on Personal Protective Equipment  (PPE)  available.  Also,  see  AFI  31-118,  Security  Forces  Standards  and Procedures, Attachment 5, Blood Borne Pathogen Exposure Control Plans. (T-1) 2.6.2.15.  Training includes measures to protect against HIV transmission, including first aid protection measures. Design the training to preclude rumors, correct misinformation, calm fears, and provide current factual information. Contact military public health office regularly to update information. (T-0) 2.6.2.16.  Training  on  Sexual  Assault  Prevention  and  Response  Awareness  includes; detection,  response,  and  proper  reporting.  Further,  the  staff  member  who  becomes personally  aware of a sexual  abuse, sexual harassment  or a retaliation  against confinees or staff that made such reports, or receives a grievance from a confinee, is independently responsible  to  report  it  to  the  proper  office  for  review/investigation.  (Exception:  if  the staff  becomes  aware  of  an  unreported  incident  which  occurred  at  another  confinement facility then notify the DFC. The DFC determines as soon as possible but, no later than 72-hours, to either, 1) notify the head of the other facility of the allegation or, 2) notify the  appropriate  investigating  agency.  In  either  case,  document  the  notification,  as appropriate.) Instruct staff how to assist confinee(s) in gaining access to care and support services.  If  staff  believes  a  confinee  is  subject  to  a  substantial  risk  of  imminent  sexual abuse, take immediate action to protect the confinee. Further, once staff has reported this to  the  proper  investigating  office  they  do  not  disclose,  other  than  to  the  official  extent necessary, any of this information except when necessary to make decisions concerning treatment, investigation and other security and management decisions. (T-0) 2.6.2.16.1.  NOTE:  Follow  the  Air  Force’s  established  procedures  on  protection against  retaliation  against  those  who  report  (in  good  faith)  violations  under  this paragraph. 2.6.2.17.  Non-3P0XX personnel performing duties in any capacity (i.e., guard or escort) are trained using criteria from this chapter for that particular duty position with training documentation  signed  or  e-signed.  Maintain  this  documentation  via  computerized spreadsheet,  log,  or  general-purpose  form  at  the  facility  to  prove  training  currency,  as AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 29 necessary. Maintain  IAW Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). (T-0) 2.6.2.18.  Local  lesson  plans  should  be  developed  for  each  above  subject  of  instruction. AFSFC/SFC  has  training  videos  with  lesson  plans  and  testing  material,  which  may  be loaned  to  units.  The  videos  are  available  online  via  AFSFC/SFC  website.  Ensure  to document in appropriate training records. (T-0) 2.7.  Management  of  Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  (HIV)  Positive  Confinees.  A confinee’s HIV positive status is not solely a consideration for transfer unless deemed necessary by medical authorities. Confinement officers ensure gaining unit is aware of HIV positive status. Confinement  officers  do  not  separate  those  who  are  HIV  positive  from  the  general  confinee population  based  solely  on  HIV  status.  Confinement  officers  also  consider  the  following  when planning for HIV positive confinees. (T-0) 2.7.1.  Follow  medical  authority  requirements  for  special  handling  of  contaminated laundry/linen. (T-0) 2.7.2.  Toilet and shower facilities are no different from those used by other confinees. (T-0) 2.7.3.  Food service sanitation provisions are no different from those used by other confinees. (T-0) 2.8.  Assessment and Treatment of HIV Positive Confinees.  Medical staffs test HIV negative confinees  in  accordance  with  current  prescribed  medical  standards.  Medical  authorities determine post exposure actions. (T-0) 2.8.1.  All  incidents  which  could  result  in  transmission  of  an  infectious disease  (i.e.,  sexual contact, tattooing, intravenous drug use, or body-fluid-to-body-fluid transfer), automatically require  immediate  HIV  testing  of  participants  unless  all  participants  are  HIV  positive. Medical  authorities  immediately  monitor/test  as  necessary  all  HIV  negative  confinee  and confinement staff involved in an incident if one or more participants are HIV positive. (T-0) 2.8.2.  HIV test results are not for public dissemination. As a minimum, medical authorities notify the parent unit commander, installation DFC, and confinement officer of HIV positive test results. Only inform confinement staff members designated by the confinement officer as having  a  need  to  know  those  confinees  who  are  HIV  positive.  Confinement  staffs  do  not annotate  HIV  status  in  the  Correctional  Treatment  File  (CTF)  or  other  records  unless  the confinement officer, as advised by legal and medical authorities, directs the entry. Disclosure of  HIV  status  for  official  purposes  should  only  be  discussed  with  command,  confinement, medical, and dental personnel. (T-0) 2.8.3.  The  confinement  officer  may  request  HIV  testing  of  any  confinee  at  any  time, provided there is a legitimate penal interest due to close communal living conditions. (T-1) 2.8.4.  If  escorts  for medical  purposes are  required, then the parent  unit provides escorts.  If parent  unit  escorts  are  prohibitive  due  to  custody  classification  requirements,  the  parent provides in-kind support (funds/manpower) to cover security forces escorts. (T-1) 2.9.  Confinee  Training.  Upon  inprocessing,  ensure  confinees  are  comprehensively  briefed  on emergency  procedures  (fire,  severe  weather,  etc.),  zero  tolerance  policy  on  sexual  abuse  and sexual  harassment  and  any  other  local  items  deemed  necessary.  Document  these  actions  in  the CTF. Immediately follow up these briefings with handouts or incorporate the briefed information 30 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 in the confinee’s Facility Rules Book. Include information on how confinees can report incidents or suspicions of sexual abuse or sexual harassment. Instruct confinees that sexual abuse or sexual harassment reports under PREA are either unrestricted reports or an anonymous report which is different  than  other  active  duty  reporting  guidelines.  Place  appropriate  emergency  procedure instructions in poster or map format (follow local safety guidelines for size of posters or maps) visible  to  the  confinees  (suggest  day  room)  as  well  as,  detection  and  reporting  of  sexual  abuse and  sexual  harassment  information  in  poster  format  (min  8x10  letter  size)  (suggest  day  room). (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 31 Chapter 3 ADMINISTRATION 3.1.  Admission  Procedures.  Confinement  Officer  establishes  policies  and  procedures  for  the admission  of  confinees  in  the  Operating  Instruction.  At  a  minimum,  these  procedures  include: determine  the  detainee/inmate  is  legally  confined,  thorough  search  of  the  individual  and possessions,  disposition  of  personal  property,  photographing,  fingerprinting,  DNA  collection, identification of marks/scars/tattoos, determine custody classifications via DD Form 2711, Initial Custody  Classification,  recording/entry  of  bio  data,  issue  H&C  items  (if  applicable),  conduct  a National  Crime  Information  Center  (NCIC)/National  Law  Enforcement  Telecommunications System (NLETS) inquiry checking for wants/warrants and sex offender information, and provide written  facility  rulebook  which  contains  as  a  minimum  the  facility  rules  and  formal  complaint process.  Processing  includes  a  brief  verbal  synopsis  of  facility  rules  and  an  interview  by  the confinement  officer  or  NCO.  Also,  if  a  ‘fit  for  confinement’  physical  has  not  been  completed, ensure it is completed within 24-hours or the next duty day. NOTE: The CFs responsibility for the collection of DNA is found in 10 USC §1565 and 42 USC §14135a. See paragraph 7.3 and Attachment 7 of this AFI for additional instructions and information. (T-0) 3.1.1.  Facility Rules Book. The confinee signs for and maintains a copy of the facility rules book until departure. (T-0) 3.1.2.  When opposite gender staff enters a cell area, they must announce their presence. (T-0) 3.1.3.  In-processing  includes:  photographing  and  fingerprinting,  search  of  the  confinee’s property  (including  clothing  being  worn),  receipt  for  property,  strip  search  of  the  person (removal  of  clothing)  to  permit  visual  inspection  of  breasts,  buttocks  and  genitalia  and  to annotate scars/marks/tattoos. Pursuant to 42 USC §§15601-15609, the same gender conducts strip  and  frisk  searches  of  confinees  except  in  exigent  circumstances.  All  opposite  gender searches must be documented in the SF Blotter and the Confinement Blotter (see paragraph 8.5.).  Cavity  searches  of  anal  or  genital  openings  will  be  done  by  a  medical  practitioner. NOTE: If during the initial interview, the interviewer determines a confinee needs medical or  behavioral  health  care,  contact  the  medical  or  behavioral  health  clinic  immediately  for assistance. (T-0) 3.1.3.1.  Within  72-hours  of  inprocessing,  screen  the  confinee  for  risk  of  sexual victimization and abusiveness using Attachment 6. This is meant to assist in determining potential risk “to become” a victim or “to become” an abuser. Screen (personally ask) the confinee  using  the  questionnaire  located  on  the  AFSFC  Corrections  website  (website usage  ensures  PREA  screening  questions  are  current  with  legal  requirements).  Take  no disciplinary  action  for  failure  to  cooperate  with  the  assessment,  specifically  questions involving;  sexual  orientation,  self-identified  gender,  previous  sexual  victim,  or  their perception of vulnerability. When necessary for staff assessment, obtain other screening answers  by  researching  personnel  records  and/or  criminal  records,  and  by  mere observation (e.g., size, body build, etc.). (T-0) 3.1.3.1.1.  If  the  staff  determines  the  confinee  has,  1)  experienced  prior  sexual victimization  in  a  previous  confinement  facility,  or  in  an  institution  or  in  the 32 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 community or, 2) has previously perpetrated sexual abuse in a previous confinement facility,  or  in  an  institution  or  in  the  community  then  offer  to  schedule  a  follow  up meeting  (to  occur  within  14  days  of  the  initial  screening)  with  a  medical  or  mental health practitioner. Place the screening document and note the acceptance/declination of  the  offer  in  the  CTF.  Subsequently,  include  in  the  CTF  the  medical  or  mental health and security/management decisions for housing, work outlets and programs. (T-0) recommendations practitioner plans, relative to treatment 3.1.3.1.2.  If  sexual  victimization  in  the  community  was  not  self-identified  in  the  at risk screening but, discovered by the medical or mental health practitioner they must seek  informed  consent  from  the  confinee,  if  over  18  years  of  age,  for  the  release  of that information to the confinement staff. NOTE: PREA requires the above notice for those over 18 years of age. Obviously, very few military members are in the Service under 18, however with  parental approval  enlistment could  occur  at  age 17  – if this situation  occurs,  it  is  most  likely  at  Lackland  AFB  or  a  technical  training  location. Informed consent is not needed by the treatment staff to report this information to the confinement staff per PREA. (T-0) 3.1.3.2.  When  the  staff  believes  the  confinee  has  adjusted  to  placement  in  a  confined setting, using the same questions and methods, conduct the screening again however, do not  exceed  30  days  from  inprocessing.  Reassess  as  necessary,  when  additional information  is  received  or  an  abusive  or  victimization  situation  occurs  or  is  believed possible. Place the screening document in the CTF. (T-0) 3.1.3.3.  Uses  for  the  screening  information.  The  goal  is  to  make  decisions  to  keep potential  victims  from  potential  abusers.  The  Confinement  NCOIC  makes  individual determinations on the best manner to ensure safety for those at risk concerning housing, work  outlets,  etc.  Conversely,  do  not  use  this  information  to  separate  groups  of individuals (where no risk of harm or abuse exists) based solely on sexual orientation or self-identified gender unless under a legal order. (T-0) 3.1.4.  Initial Confinement Physical Examination. This determination is made as a result of a health record check and physical examination by a medical officer. The examining medical officer  certifies  "fitness"  for  confinement  on  the  confinement  order  within  24-hours  after entry into confinement or next duty day for processing on weekends or holidays. Fitness for confinement  is  not  synonymous  with  fitness  for  arduous  duty.  However,  the  examining official  should specify physical limitations to  full duty performance in  writing or provide  a copy  of  the  individual's  current  AF  Form  469,  Duty  Limiting  Condition  Report.  If  the examining medical officer determines the person is "not fit" for confinement, the person will be admitted to a medical treatment facility (see paragraph 5.7.) or placed in a CF capable of caring  for  the  member's  medical  condition.  The  confinement  examination,  at  a  minimum, includes a medical and behavioral health records review (including immunization currency), a physical examination, appropriate laboratory screening, and medication reconciliation. (T-0) 3.1.4.1.  The  examining  medical  officer  documents for  confinement recommendation on DD Form 2707, Confinement Order. Additionally, document history, physical,  and  annotate  the  presence  of  cuts,  bruises,  or  unusual  marks  on  a  SF  600, Chronological Record of Medical Care, or similar form. The medical officer validates the fitness AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 33 member's  current  medication  list  for  the  confinement  facility.  The  medical  officer  tests for  communicable  diseases,  including  HIV,  Tuberculosis  (TB),  Hepatitis  B  and  C,  and conduct  urinalysis  screening  for  illegal  drug  and  narcotics  use.  The  medical  officer inspects all body cavities to prevent the introduction of contraband into the facility. The DD Form 2707 is filed in the CTF with all of the documented results, except HIV result, which  is  annotated  in  the  medical  treatment  file.  Mental  and  physical  conditions  are immediately discussed between the examining official and confinement Officer or NCO so  that  appropriate  safeguards  can  be  implemented,  if  necessary.  Female  confinees  are administered a pregnancy test, with results annotated on the confinement order and in the medical  treatment  record.  Finally,  the  medical  officer  renders  an  assessment  of  the confinee’s ability to self-medicate while in the confinement facility. (T-0) 3.1.4.1.1.  NOTE:  See paragraph 2.8.2., the medical staff documents HIV test results in  the  confinee's  medical  records.  Ensure  results  are  immediately  provided  to  either the military CF commander/officer/NCO so the staff may take appropriate safety/bio hazard measures for spilled bodily fluids. the  confinee  displays irrational  or 3.1.4.2.  If is symptomatic  of  mental  disturbance,  consult  a  medical  or  mental  health  practitioner immediately  for  disposition.  If  the  confinee  displays  the  effects  of  hallucinatory substance, place the confinee in appropriate medical/mental health facility until such time as they are detoxified and medically/mentally certified fit for confinement. (T-1) inappropriate  behavior  which 3.1.4.3.  Urinalysis testing is required as an inspection for contraband, pursuant to MCM, Part  III,  Section  III,  MRE  313(b).  Testing  is  conducted  under  the  AF  Drug  Testing Program,  category  MO  (medical  drug  test),  IAW  AFI  44-120,  Drug  Abuse  Testing Program. (T-0) 3.1.5.  Seek  to  segregate  new  detainees/inmates  from  others  during  initial  processing  and administration.  Confinees,  including  pretrial  Officer  and  NCO  detainees,  do  not  exercise command or supervisory authority over other persons. (T-0) 3.1.5.1.  NOTE:  It is not inappropriate to refer to a pretrial detainee by rank and name; however, avoid calling an officer detainee Sir or Ma’am. 3.1.6.  Fingerprint  Cards.  When  initially  processed  by  an  AF  confinement  facility,  the  staff completes  two  originals  of  the  FD-249,  Arrest  and  Institution  Card  (or  its  electronic equivalent),  attaches  a  photograph  to  the  form  for  all  confinees  in-processed  on  a  military confinement  order  (whether  housed  on  military  installation  or  via  a  local  contract  with civilian facility). For all post-trial inmates, submit their electronic fingerprints to the Criminal Justice  Information  Services  Division  (CJIS),  IAW  AFI  31-118,  SF  Standards  and Procedures. Since the  FBI  only  accepts  electronic  fingerprints, consult SF Investigations for  local  procedures  for  submitting  fingerprints  to  the  FBI-CJIS,  as  it  requires  electronic submission equipment. File a copy of the fingerprints in the confinees CTF. NOTE: Do not submit inmate fingerprints to FBI on the same system used for security clearances. (T-0) 3.1.6.1.  Upon  receipt  of  CA’s  action  in  which  the  adjudged  sentence  is  set  aside, remitted, or overturned, accomplish FBI Form R-84, Final Disposition Report. Mail one copy  to:  FBI,  CJIS  Division  (Criminal  Justice  Information  Services  Division),  1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg WV 26306 and maintain a copy in the CTF. (T-0) 34 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 3.1.6.2.  If  an  inmate  with  a  FD-249  on  file  escapes,  complete  two  originals  of  the  FBI Form I-12, Flash/Cancellation Notice, in addition to reporting requirements referenced in paragraph  3.7.  Upon  recapture,  complete  another  set  of  FBI  Form  I-12.  For  both situations,  forward  one  form  to  the  FBI  CJIS  Division,  1000  Custer  Hollow  Road, Clarksburg WV 26306, file the other in the CTF. (T-0) 3.1.6.3.  If  an  inmate  with  a  FD-249  on  file  dies,  immediately  notify  the  FBI  CJIS Division,  1000  Custer  Hollow  Road,  Clarksburg  WV  26306,  of  the  death  by  letter. Include postmortem fingerprints for humanitarian purposes only. (T-0) 3.1.6.3.1.  In cases of an inmate (or parolee or appellant) death the commander is not required to send a condolence letter to the next of kin. 3.1.6.4.  Order  FBI  forms from  the  FBI, Criminal  Justice  Information Services Division (CJIS), Attn: LSU, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg WV 26306 or (304) 625-3983; for questions or training materials, call (304) 625-2000. (T-0) 3.1.7.  DD  Form  506,  Daily  Strength  Record  of  Confinees.  Record  arrival/departure  of pretrial  detainees  and  post-trial  inmates.  Report  the  following:  entries  into  confinement; when there  are changes  in  custody  classification  or status; releases;  gains; losses;  transfers; and death. A new report is not necessary if there is no change from day to day. Accomplish a new report only when changes occur. (T-0) 3.1.8.  SFMIS  Entries.  Security  Forces  Management  Information  System  (SFMIS)  provides database tracking (confinee status, sex offender registration, DNA collection, VWAP) in real time,  visible  to  MAJCOMs  and  AFSFC.  Enter  confinee  information  into  Defense Information-Based  Reporting  System/National Incident-Based  Reporting  System (DIBRS/NIBRS), IAW AFI 31-203. (T-1) 3.1.9.  DD Form 515,  Roster of Prisoners, supplements DD Form 506.  If confinement is  to be served off-base in a civilian facility, follow locally established tracking procedures. As a minimum, the confinement NCO maintains facility contact and provides parent unit liaison, as needed, through release. (T-1) 3.2.  Correctional  Treatment  File  (CTF)  .  Establish  a  CTF  for  each  pretrial  detainee  and adjudged  inmate  during  in-processing  and  actively  maintain  it  during  incarceration.  Confinees are not allowed access nor may they receive information from any CTFs. (T-0) 3.2.1.  At a minimum, the CTF includes the confinee’s records outlined in the sub-paragraphs below  and  any  requirements  for  counseling,  special  training,  employment  records,  and/or personal  problems  that  may  affect  treatment.  The  correctional  officer  may  include  other documents as necessary. (T-0)  3.2.1.1.  NOTE:  A  six-part  folder  is  usually  the  most  efficient  way  to  keep  this information compartmentalized. 3.2.2.  DD  Form  2707,  Confinement  Order.  All  pretrial  detainees  and  post-trial  inmates  are required to have a DD Form 2707 completed prior to incarceration. (T-0) 3.2.3.  DD  Form  2718,  Prisoner  Release  Order,  is  used  as  authority  to  release  a  confinee from  confinement.  The  DFC  or  designated  representative  with  release  authority  may authenticate DD Form 2718 in cases when a pretrial detainee is acquitted or their charges are withdrawn,  or  when  a  post-trial  inmate  has  completed  their  sentence  or  been  paroled.  The AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 35 DD Form 2718 is not used when transferring to another confinement location, as orders are sufficient authority for accomplishing transfers. (T-0) 3.2.3.1.  NOTE:  Temporary release is done using DD Form 2708, Receipt for Inmate or Detained Person. 3.2.4.  Complete DD Form 2710, Prisoner Background Summary. (T-0) 3.2.5.  Complete DD Form 504, Request and Receipt for Health and Comfort Supplies. (T-0) 3.2.6.  Complete DD Form 2714, Prisoner Disciplinary Report, as necessary. (T-0) 3.2.7.  Complete DD Form 509, Inspection Record of Prisoner in Segregation. (T-0) 3.2.8.  Complete DD Form 510, Prisoner Request. (T-0) 3.2.9.  Complete  DD  Form  2715,  Clemency/Parole  Submission.  Inmates  may  consult  their area defense counsel or attorney prior to completing their request. (T-0) 3.2.10.  Use DD Form 2715-2, Prisoner Summary Data, to record changes in status: progress during  confinement,  psychiatric  or  behavioral  health  evaluations,  and  parole  officer recommendations. (T-0) 3.2.11.  Use  DD  Form  2719,  Continuation  Sheet,  to  continue  information  from  DD  Forms 2710-1,  Inmate  Sentence  Information;  2715;  2715-1,  Disposition  Board  Recommendation; and 2715-2. (T-0) 3.2.12.  Complete DD Form 2711. (T-0) 3.2.13.  The  parent  unit  updates  confinee  duty  status  codes  and  processes  the  form  through the  local  FSS  and  FSO.  Ensure  Confinement  NCOs  receive  a  copy  of  the  AF  Form  2098, which places the confinee in the proper duty status. Place the form into the CTF. Reference AFI 36-2134, Air Force Duty Status Program for procedures. (T-1) 3.2.14.  The CTF folder needs to be properly marked/identified if there are participants under VWAP  (i.e.,  “CASE  HAS  VWAP  PARTICIPANTS”,  or  another  appropriate  jacket  cover annotation). Separately file completed VWAP forms from the CTF in files, by inmate name, clearly  marked,  “CONTAINS  VICTIM  OR  WITNESS  INFORMATION”  and  “Do  Not Release to  Inmate.” Place completed VWAP  forms  in  a secure  file location, with  restricted access (i.e., VWAP monitor, confinement officer, etc.). (T-0) 3.2.15.  When  a  detainee/inmate  transfers,  the  losing  facility  keeps  copies  of  documents closing the Personal Deposit Fund (PDF); a copy of the AF Form 330,  Record Transmittal, listing all transferred items (including the CTF); and a copy of the DD Form 2708,  Receipt for Pre-Trial/Post Trial Prisoner or Detained Person. (T-0) 3.3.  Desk  Blotters  .  Security  Forces  Desk  Blotter  is  used  to  record  all  confinee  in-  and  out-processing,  daily  arrivals/departures  of  confinees  with  destination  locations/reason/names  of escorts,  contraband  searches/finds,  escapes,  injuries,  deaths,  D-cell  and  H-cell  activity  for investigation  or  law  enforcement  process  purposes,  as  well  as,  staff  names  conducting  an opposite gender search and reason. Initial blotter entries for newly arrived confinees include time of  confinement  with  name,  rank,  organization,  home  station  and  reason  (pretrial  or  post-trial).The  DFC  may  decide  to  maintain  an  additional  Confinement  Blotter  in  the  facility  thus saving the SF Desk Blotter from the detailed routine daily chronological confinement events. If a 36 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 separate  Confinement  Blotter  is  the  DFC’s  preference  it  supplements  the  SF  Desk  Blotter  by separately recording; reveille/retreat, PT, staff-on-duty, medication call, custody status changes, rec  call,  meals,  mail  call,  visitation  call  with  visitor  names/times,  and  staff  names  conducting same  gender  search  and  reason.  If  the  Confinement  Blotter  option  is  not  used,  include  all  the above  entry  information  in  the  SF  Desk  Blotter.  Use  same  archive  disposition  instructions  for Confinement Blotter as SF Blotter. (T-0) 3.3.1.  Staff  ensures  record  management  within  the  facility  and  adheres  to  policy  and procedures, as well as acts in accordance with AF Records Information Management System (AFRIMS).  Reference  records  disposition  instructions  in  AFRIMS,  Records  Disposition Schedule, Table 31-2. (T-1) 3.4.  Disposition  and  Release  of  Confinee  Records.  The  establishment,  use,  and  content  of confinee  records;  right  to  privacy;  secure  placement  and  preservation  of  records;  and  schedule for archiving and destroying of inactive confinee is a collective key administrative requirement to ensure proper continuity and safety of all. (T-0) 3.4.1.  Release of Inmate Records. To the maximum extent possible, confinement staff needs to protect process information involved in corrections (i.e., VWAP, Sex Offender), clemency and parole, restoration, and reenlistment in the release of records requested.  Ensure release of  information  is  in  accordance  with  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  and/or  the Privacy  Act  (PA).  Consult  DoD  5400.7-R_AFMAN  33-302,  Freedom  of  Information  Act Program,  and  AFI  33-332,  AF  Privacy  and  Civil  Liberties  Program,  for  FOIA/PA procedures concerning release or denial of information. (T-0) 3.4.2.  The AF has an exemption under the Privacy Act for all corrections and rehabilitation records.  See  32  CFR  §806b.30  (1998)  and  5  USC  §552a(j)(2)(West  1996)  concerning  this exemption. Cite both as the reason for not releasing exempt information. (T-0) 3.4.3.  Confinement  staff  members  work  with  the  FOIA  officer  to  determine  releasability under FOIA of information in corrections and rehabilitation records and identify exemptions. Typically,  evaluations  and  recommendations  are  usually  exempt  under  5  USC  §552(b)(5). (T-0) 3.4.4.  When pretrial detainees are released from confinement due to not guilty findings from Courts-Martial  or  if  charges  were  dismissed  and  when  post-trial  inmates  complete confinement  sentences  at  Level  I  and  are  returned  to  their  unit  of  assignment  or  placed  on appellate leave, the CTF remains at the facility. The facility is responsible for the disposition of the CTF, IAW AFRIMS, Records Disposition Schedule. Confinees are not allowed access to VWAP or CTF files since these files are FOIA and PA exempt. Also, safeguard and apply appropriate restrictions on access to confinee medical treatment files. (T-0) 3.4.5.  When  transferred,  either  temporarily  or  permanently,  to  another  military  facility,  the escort  hand  delivers  the  CTF  and  medical  record.  If  transferred  to  a  non-military  federal facility or a civilian facility, the CTF and medical record remains with unit overseeing the SA or contract. Do not allow confinee access to the CTF. (T-0) 3.4.6.  CTFs  are  privileged  and  are  to  be  safeguarded  from  theft,  compromise,  and unauthorized disclosure. These files are used, among other purposes, for parole and clemency recommendations and determinations. The CTF is considered part of law enforcement files. (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 37 3.4.7.  All  files  maintenance  and  disposition  of  records  are  IAW  AFRIMS,  Records Disposition Schedule, Table 31-2. (T-0) 3.5.  Clothing  and  personal  property.  Confinement  officers  authorize  possession  of  personal property.  The  confinement  staff  inspects  and  inventories  all  personal  property  brought  to  the facility  by  the  confinee.  Confinees  and  parent  units  are  responsible  for  disposition  of unauthorized  personal  property.  Confinement  staff  members  use  AF  Form  807  to  document personal  property  and  file  the  form  in  the  CTF.  The  confinement  staff  strictly  and  uniformly enforces removal of unauthorized and contraband items. All items which could be used to inflict injury  are  seized.  The  confinement  officer’s  decision  is  not  subject  to  confinee  or  parent  unit appeal. (T-0) 3.5.1.  Clothing. Pretrial detainees and post-trial inmates confined in the AFCS (i.e., Level I CFs)  wear  the  ABU  uniform  or  other  Service  equivalent.  Distinctive  uniforms  are  only authorized on a case-by-case basis for those detainees/inmates posing a danger to the public or an escape risk and then only after coordination and approval from AFSFC/SFC. Approval may  be  requested  via  e-mail  or  telephone.  Because  an  individual  determined  to  be appropriate  for  the  request  of  a  distinctive  uniform  may  not  actually  be  appropriate  for confinement at a base jail, AFSFC/SFC’s involvement helps navigate potential issues to find appropriate resolution. (T-1) 3.5.1.1.  NOTE:  Refer to paragraph 1.2., for the AFCS philosophy. Placing detainees or inmates in distinctive clothing, especially those with short sentences, for relatively minor crimes  only  draws  attention  to  their  status.  This  has  been  proven  to  be  detrimental  to rehabilitative  efforts  as  it  further  ostracizes  them  from  society.  It  is  not  appropriate  to physically  draw  attention  to  confinees  for  the  purpose  of  “deterrence”  to  others,  to “remind” them of their status, or in any manner that would subject them to ridicule or be degrading. Distinctive or modified uniform or uniform components are not approved for entire  AFCS  facility  population.  Facilities  may  utilize  locally  designed/procured identification card badges or vendor available prison type identification wrist bands (i.e., using  a  word  and  barcode  system  to  identify  name,  custody  classification/status,  photo, etc.,)  which  facilitates  tracking/logging  of  movement  with  use  of  a  barcode  reader. Installation O&M funds are used to purchase distinctive uniforms approved for wear by AFSFC. As stated in  Chapter 1, AF confinees housed in sister Service facilities follow their rules. 3.5.2.  Pretrial  detainee  clothing.  Military  members  in  pretrial  status  are  not  convicted  of  a crime  and  will  continue  to  wear  the  ABU  (utility)  uniform  with  authorized  rank  insignia, badges, patches, devices, etc. If it is determined by the DFC that a pretrial detainee poses a threat risk beyond the reasons for pretrial confinement (harm to self/others, flight risk, etc.), a distinctive uniform (if approved by AFSFC/SFC) may be used IAW MCM, Part II, Chap. 3, Rules 304 and 305. Pretrial distinctive uniforms will have the following items as a minimum: cloth USAF and name tapes and cloth rank insignia (or air crew style name patch). (T-0) 3.5.2.1.  NOTE 1  : At risk pretrial detainees wear distinctive uniforms different in color from  at  risk  post-trial  inmates  (recommend  at  risk  pretrial  detainees  wear  orange jumpsuits).  If  qualified/privileged  Mental  Health  provider  determines  that  safety  or suicide  is  an  issue,  place  into  jumpsuit  immediately  and  back  brief  AFSFC/SFC  on  the next  duty  day.  For  routine  requests,  e-mail:  afsfc.sfct.inmate@us.af.mil,  include 38 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 confinee’s  name,  justification,  and  length  of  time  needed.  For  urgent  (non-duty  hours) assistance, call 1-877-273-3098 for AFSFC/SFC assistance. 3.5.2.2.  NOTE  2:  Except  for  court  appearances,  SF  members  placed  in  pretrial confinement will not wear the SF identification badge or beret. 3.5.3.  Post-trial  inmate  clothing.  Individuals  in  this  status  are  still  military  members; however, they are not afforded many of the privileges of military members and they wear the ABU (utility) uniform with only the cloth USAF and name tapes. If it is determined by the DFC that a post-trial inmate poses a threat risk beyond the reasons for confinement (harm to self/others, flight risk, etc.), a distinctive uniform (if approved by AFSFC/SFC) may be used IAW MCM, Part II, Chap. 3, Rules 304 and 305. Post-trial distinctive uniforms will have the following  items  as  a  minimum:  cloth  USAF  and  name  tapes  with  NO  rank  insignia  (or  air crew style name patch). (T-0) 3.5.3.1.  NOTE 1  : At risk post-trial inmates wear distinctive uniforms different in color from  at  risk  pretrial  detainees  (recommend  at  risk  post-trial  inmates  wear  white  or  blue jumpsuits,  be  consistent  within  the  facility  for  color  choice).  If  qualified/privileged Mental Health provider determines that safety or suicide is an issue, place into jumpsuit immediately  and  back  brief  AFSFC/SFC  on  the  next  duty  day.  For  routine  requests,  e-mail:  afsfc.sfct.inmate@us.af.mil,  include  confinee’s  name,  justification,  and  length  of time needed. For urgent assistance, call 1-877-273-3098 to forward to AFSFC/SFC staff after hours. 3.5.3.2.  NOTE  2:  Post-trial  enlisted  inmates  who  are  not  reduced  to  Airman  Basic,  or for inmates who are a former officer, no rank insignia will be worn during the period of confinement.  This  aspect  is  for  the  administrative  purpose  of  confinee  population management  and  control  and  is  not  to  be  viewed  as  a  form  of  “punishment”. EXCEPTION:  Post-trial  inmates  will  wear  grade  insignia  and  authorized  function badges and devices only on service dress uniform for court proceedings/hearings. 3.6.  Funds and Valuables.  In accordance with DoDI 1325.07, Enclosure 2, Paragraph 8a-b, the Services  determine  how  to  manage  the  personal  deposit  fund  (PDF)  concerning  authorizations and  reasonable  limitations.  The  PDF  is  designed  to  have  all  confinee  funds  in  one  banking account with the individual’s funds tracked separately by the custodian. It is essential to balance the bank total against the end of day deposits/withdraws from the individual confinees. Ensure a confinee’s  funds  balance  is  presented  to  the  confinee  upon  release  or  to  the  escort  team  to provide to the gaining facility, if the confinee is permanently transferred. Receipt any deposit or withdrawal action with one copy given to the confinee, one copy to the CFT and the original for the master file in the custodian’s office. The PDF is for confinees to purchase their H&C items, as  well  as  other  confinee  expenditures  (e.g.,  dependent  support,  educational  material,  attorney fees, payment of debts, and restitution to victims, etc.). The DFC may authorize larger one time unique  deposits  in  an  amount  intended  to  be  immediately  disbursed,  i.e.,  to  make  interim mortgage payment, pay legal fees, make restitution, etc., pending legal resolution (via Power of Attorney, for example) of the confinee’s financial obligations to another party of  the confinee’s choosing. It is the intent of the AF that the majority of deposit and withdraw actions by confinees be used for individual purchase of H&C items. NOTE 1: While some PDF form titles created by DoD indicate, “inmate” and/or “prisoner”, while not exact in current terminology consider each to refer to a person who is confined. NOTE 2: See Attachment 8 for sample template.  (T-1) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 39 3.6.1.  The PDF account is best managed when the total amounts are relatively small. Unless uniquely  authorized  by  the  DFC,  per  paragraph  3.6.,  the  PDF  custodian  limits  individual confinee total deposits on hand to be less than $200.00 in US currency or equivalent at any one  time.  Instruct  the  confinee  to  designate  to  whom,  or  to  which  bank,  they  wish  excess funds to be disbursed. (T-1) 3.6.2.  The  DFC  appoints  by  letter,  a  primary  and  two  alternate  PDF  custodians,  providing copies to  the servicing bank and FSO, as needed. The custodian deposits  confinee personal funds into the PDF. The custodian may use on or off base banking facilities, charging bank fees and costs to the installation O&M fund. The custodian maintains the PDF account using the guidelines below: (T-1) 3.6.2.1.  The  custodian  or  alternate,  balances  the  PDF  each  duty  day.  Quarterly,  the DFC’s rater appoints a disinterested party, unassociated with the PDF in the grade of E-7 or above or civilian equivalent, to audit the PDF and provide those results directly to the DFC’s rater. (T-1) 3.6.2.2.  Changes of custodian/alternates require transfer of PDF accountability. Use the certificate at Attachment 9 to document the custodian change. (T-1) 3.6.2.2.1.  NOTE:  Attempt to coincide custodian changes with the quarterly audits to enhance accountability. 3.6.2.3.  Secure cash, checks, vouchers, and receipts properly. (T-1) 3.6.2.4.  Use AF Form 1387, Receipt-Inmate’s Personal Deposit Fund, to receipt for all funds  (negotiable  instruments).  Provide  the  confinee  a  copy  of  the  AF  Form  1387  as  a receipt and  file the duplicate  copy with the AF  Form 1388,  Summary  Receipt  Voucher-Inmate’s Personal Deposit Fund. (T-1) 3.6.2.4.1.  Deposit  only  checks  from  government/military  accounts,  PDF  custodian checks,  money  orders,  cashier  checks,  (or  cash  as  related  to  initial  confinement  in-processing).  The  only  cash  allowed  to  be  deposited  into  the  PDF  is  any  cash  being held  by a pretrial  detainee or immediate post-trial  inmate during initial  confinement in-processing.  For  any  non-US  currency  or  instruments,  the  servicing  bank determines the exchange rates. Custodian deposits cash in the servicing bank as soon as possible. (T-1) 3.6.2.4.2.  Do not accept payroll deposits to the account. (T-1) 3.6.2.5.  Use  AF  Form  1388  to  total  daily  receipts  and  assign  a  voucher  number  to  the form  (e.g.,  AXX-01).  XX  indicates  the  last  two  digits  of  the  current  year;  and  01 indicates the first  voucher of the  year, add a number for each subsequent  voucher. This procedure applies to AF Forms 1391 and 1393. (T-1) 3.6.2.5.1.  Use DD Form 504, to process H&C purchase requests. (T-1) 3.6.2.5.2.  Use AF Form 1390, Withdrawal Request-Inmate’s Personal Deposit Fund, to make purchase requests or forward money. (T-1) 3.6.2.5.3.  Use AF Form 1391, Group Purchase Voucher-Inmate’s Personal Deposit Fund, for requests involving more than one confinee. Assign voucher numbers  (e.g., BXX-01) in the same manner as AF Form 1388. (T-1) 40 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 3.6.2.5.4.  Use  AF  Form  1392,  Summary  Disbursement  Voucher-Inmate’s  Personal Deposit Fund, to list all checks drawn from the PDF. (T-1) 3.6.2.5.5.  Use AF Form 1393, Petty Cash Voucher-Inmate’s Personal Deposit Fund, for  locally  authorized  expenditures.  Assign  voucher  numbers  (e.g.,  CXX-01)  in  the same manner as the AF Forms 1388 and 1391. (T-1) 3.6.2.5.6.  .  Use  AF  Form  1398,  Daily  Status-Inmate’s  Personal  Deposit  Fund,  to record confinee’s daily PDF balances. (T-1) 3.6.2.5.7.  Stamp  all  checks  written  from  PDF  account  as  "Void  after  (30,  60,  90 days)" as locally determined appropriate. (T-1) 3.6.2.5.7.1.  NOTE:  The least amount of time possible is generally best to reduce number of outstanding checks. 3.6.3.  Maintain appropriate copies of requests and vouchers in the confinee’s CTF. Maintain the  master  copies  in  the  facility.  Individual  PDF  records  may  be  destroyed  along  with  the CTF. Master copies, including bank statements,  are maintained in  the facility for two CYs, and then destroyed. (T-1) 3.6.4.  Occasionally,  the  ledger  needs  to  be  cleared  of  abandoned  checks.  Consult  with  the installation FSO for disposition  of funds when  confinees or payees have  not  cashed  checks within 181 days past the void after date of the check. AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 41 Chapter 4 FACILITY CRITERIA 4.1.  AFCS Facilities.  Level I CFs include cells for general population and segregation. Refer to paragraph 2.1.-2.2. for differences between CFs and holding/detention operations. 4.1.1.  Standards for cells and other areas in the CF. The facility design must include escape prevention,  as  well  as  safety  and  emergency  evacuation.  Confinement  cells  have  as  a minimum: hot/cold running water, toilet, HVAC, lighting, an elevated (off the floor) sleeping surface in the cells. Within the CF secured perimeter it must have showers, washer/dryer, day room, interview/visitation room, staff admin/storage, and recreation area. (T-0) 4.1.1.1.  Cell design standard. 4.1.1.1.1.  Facilities  which  routinely  house  the  confinee  in  their  cell/room  for  less than 10-hours a day, not including sleep time, are to be a minimum of 72 square feet of space (35 square feet of which must be unencumbered) per single occupancy cells and  72  square  feet  of  space  per  occupant  (25  square  feet  of  which  must  be unencumbered  per  person)  in  multiple  occupancy  cells/rooms.  Minimum  ceiling height of 8 feet. (T-0) 4.1.1.1.2.  Facilities  which  routinely  house  the  confinee  in  their  cell/room  for  more than 10-hours a day, not including sleep time, are to be a minimum of 80 square feet of space (35 square feet of which must be unencumbered) per single occupancy cells and  80  square  feet  of  space  per  occupant  (25  square  feet  of  which  must  be unencumbered  per  person)  in  multiple  occupancy  cells/rooms.  Minimum  ceiling height of 8 feet. (T-0) 4.1.1.1.2.1.  NOTE  1:  From  time  to  time  incidents  or  temporary  staffing challenges  may  necessitate  cell  occupancies  of  more  than  10-hours  a  day.  To ensure future mission flexibility and to avoid noncompliance issues, plan for any new construction or modification to meet the 80 square feet requirement. 4.1.1.2.  Segregation  cells  (Administrative/Disciplinary)  are  located  so  physical  contact with  other  segregated  or  non-segregated  confinees  is  impossible  and  minimize  the possibility  of  escape  and  self-inflicted  injury.  Installations  utilizing  a  contract  with  off-base civilian facilities will comply with paragraph 4.1.2. for division by housing. (T-0) 4.1.1.3.  For dormitory style CFs built prior to 1 Jan 1997, design the space allotment on the basis of 72 square feet per confinee computed on a net room area that includes open aisle but excludes latrines, closed corridors, and utility space. Dormitory style CFs were not authorized to be built after 1 Jan 1997. (T-0) 4.1.1.4.  When conditions prevent the use of standard space allocation during temporary periods  of  increased  populations,  provide  50  square  feet  per  confinee.  Installation commanders may approve operations under the reduced space allocation rule for up to 60 days.  Installation  should  contact  AFSFC/SFC  for  assistance  in  transfers  to  reduce population.  Only  AFSFC/SFC  may  approve  emergency  minimum  space  allocation  for periods over 60 days. (T-1) 42 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 4.1.1.5.  Ensure dayrooms provide a minimum of 40 square feet per confinee allowed to use the room at any one time. Dayrooms and/or recreation rooms will contain at least 100 square feet. (T-0) 4.1.1.6.  Ensure  CFs  comply  with  all  applicable  standards  and  codes,  to  include: construction, fire safety, etc. (T-0) 4.1.2.  Ensure  division  of  confinee  housing  is  by  status  (pretrial/post-trial),  custody classification, and  gender. Confinees not  segregated for  cause or in  maximum  custody  may share dayroom and recreation yard times, when directly supervised by staff. (T-0) 4.1.3.  Ensure  provisions  for  reasonable  comfort  consistent  with  good  order  and  discipline. (T-1) 4.1.4.  Endeavor to make administrative areas separate from security functions. (T-3) 4.1.5.  Provide secure storage space for personal property. (T-0) 4.1.6.  Provide H&C items storage area. (T-0) 4.1.7.  Provide secure janitorial supply storage area. (T-0) 4.1.8.  Provide  a  visiting  area  with  controlled  entry  and  exit  that  allows  for  private conversation and has storage space for visitors’ personal property, i.e., coats, handbags, etc. (T-1) 4.1.9.  Provide dayrooms with space for reading, writing and table games. CFs can fulfill this requirement by having access to a room/area outside the cell. (T-0) 4.2.  Safety,  Security,  Fire  Prevention,  and  Comfort  Measures.  The  confinement  officer determines  the  level/frequency  of  extra-curricular  self-inspections  and  safety  drills  through written  policy  and  procedure.  Coordinate  with  appropriate  agencies  to  assist  in  facility compliance with safety, security, and fire prevention standards. Use the following guidelines: 4.2.1.  The  facility  (building)  manager  develops  written  policy  in  concert  with  appropriate functional experts, with the approval of the confinement officer, IAW host requirements, for ground and fire safety, as well as security inspections. The confinement officer reviews fire safety  policies  and  procedures  with  a  qualified  CES inspector  during  scheduled reviews/inspections. (T-1) 4.2.2.  The confinement officer appoints in writing a confinement staff member or the facility manager to conduct weekly security, safety, fire prevention, and sanitation inspections. Seek expertise  or  training  from  qualified  sources  as  necessary  (fire  inspector,  installation  safety office, etc.). (T-1) 4.2.2.1.  NOTE:  Local or State fire codes must be strictly adhered to in order to ensure the safety and well-being of confinees and staff. In the event local and/or state codes are not applicable, the requirements of the National Fire Protection Association (i.e., NFPA 101) Life Safety Code apply. 4.2.3.  Weekly security inspections should include checking all bars, locks, windows, walls, floors, vent covers, glass panels, access  plates, protective screens, doors, devices, and other areas within the secured environment to ensure they are fully operational (list can be tailored to  local  needs).  Emergency  keys  should  be  checked  at  least  quarterly  to  ensure  they  are  in AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 43 working order. Identify defective security equipment for repair or replacement immediately. (T-1) 4.2.4.  Fire  Prevention  and  Protection/Emergency  Evacuation  Plans  include  but  are  not limited  to  the  following:  provisions  for  an  adequate  fire  protection  service;  system  of  fire inspection and testing of equipment at intervals approved by the authority having jurisdiction (NTE  at  least  quarterly)  following  the  compensatory  measure  for  procedures  stated  for waivers, variances, and  exceptions on fire systems; annual  inspections by  local  or state  fire officials  or  other  qualified  person  or  at  intervals  approved  by  the  authority  having jurisdiction; availability of fire protection equipment at appropriate locations throughout the facility. (T-1) 4.2.4.1.  Follow  local  base  or  code  compliance  if  Noncombustible  Storage/Disposal Containers are required. (T-1) 4.2.4.2.  Fire  Safety  Inspections.  Reference  AFI  32-2001,  Fire  Emergency  Services Program. Conduct necessary and required facility fire prevention inspections. (T-1) 4.2.4.3.  Evacuation Drills. Confinement officer ensures emergency plans for evacuation of  personnel,  control  of  fire,  and  salvage  of  property  are  prepared  and  tested.  Conduct evacuation drills at irregular times IAW with host requirements, but at least monthly, and record in  the blotter. Confinees are not  normally moved from  the controlled area of the CF during fire (evacuation) drills. Locally devised plans are the best method. Whenever possible, use the fenced recreation yard as the primary evacuation point. (T-1) 4.2.4.4.  Automatic  Sprinkler  Systems.  Use  local  and  transmitted  water  flow  alarms  for automatic sprinkler systems. Annunciate transmittal alarms at continuously attended duty desks (in addition to the fire dispatch). Consult local requirements. (T-1) 4.2.4.5.  Automatic  Fire  Alarm  Systems.  Install  automatic  fire  alarm  systems  for  the protection of life and critical material, especially in combustible confinement facilities, if automatic sprinkler protection is not feasible. Follow appropriate local codes. (T-1) 4.2.4.6.  Smoke  Detectors.  Hard-wired  detectors  are  the  best  solution  in  corrections.  If battery  powered  detectors  are  used,  conduct  operational  checks  as  required  by  code  or unit manufacturer. (T-1) 4.2.5.  Security  and  Physical  Barriers  to  control  public  entry  into  CF  and  prevent  escape. Stand-alone facilities (not attached or collocated with LE Desk/BDOC) require single-fenced perimeter  which  is  at  least  8-foot-high,  9-guage  steel  wire,  chain-link  fence  fabric,  with  3-strand barbed wire mounted on an inward 45-degree angle. Secure fence fabric at the bottom. Ensure gates are wide enough to permit entry for appropriate emergency vehicles. (T-0) 4.2.5.1.  Augmented  Security.  When  possible,  use  Closed  Circuit  Television  (CCTV)  to augment  internal  and  external  security.  Recording  is  necessary  to  identify,  investigate, and  protect  staff  and  confinees  after  the  fact.  Follow  CCTV  monitoring  under  PREA requirements, e.g., to eliminate blind spots where staff or confinees may be isolated. (T-0)  There  are  additional  requirements  under  PREA.  Follow  the  requirements  of  PREA Resource Center’s Checklists available on AFSFC website under Corrections.  NOTE 1: CCTV does not replace staff, it augments.  NOTE  2: Digital recording is preferred over video tape recording. NOTE 3: See paragraph 2.4.1.3. for additional AF guidance. 44 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 4.2.5.1.1.  Ensure CCTV does not invade confinee privacy (i.e., do not place in cells, toilet,  or  shower  areas)  unless  suicidal  or  violent  behavior  dictates  otherwise.  Keep CCTV  monitors  from  public  view.  Ensure  opposite  gender  staff  cannot  view monitors.  Follow  guidelines  for  cross  gender  viewing  under  PREA.  (T-0)  See paragraph 2.4.1.3. for additional AF guidance. 4.2.5.1.1.1.  NOTE  1:  There  are  additional  requirements  under  PREA.  Follow the  requirements  of  PREA  Resource  Checklists  available  on  AFSFC  website under Corrections. 4.2.5.1.2.  Do not have opposite gender staff physically monitor confinee latrine and shower areas. (T-0) 4.2.5.1.3.  Facilities may use IDS systems, where applicable. (T-2) 4.2.6.  Locks and Keys. Use appropriate hardware (jail/prison) to secure cells. Do not secure cells  with  padlocks.  Keep  all  keys  in  a  secure  location  and  establish  issue/return/inventory procedures. (T-0) 4.2.7.  Duplicate  facility  entry  keys  must  be  immediately  available  for  emergencies.  Ensure procedures  are  covered  in  emergency  plans.  Locate  duplicates  near  the  facility  vice  in LED/BDOCs across the base. Consider use of Knox Boxes ™ Ensure these keys are included in quarterly function checks. NOTE: These locked boxes work best when secured outside the facility but still under visual observation by a post/sentry/camera, etc. Select location so it is quickly accessible by Fire Dept and/or SF Flight Chief. (T-0) 4.2.7.1.  Electronic  locks  must  have  a  manual  backup.  Monitor  control  panels  on  a  24-hour  basis.  Ensure  electronic  panels  contain  an  emergency  "group  release"  for  cell  or room doors. (T-0) 4.2.8.  Interior  and  exterior  lighting.  New  construction  after  1  Jan  2003  requires  day  rooms and cells with access to natural light. Consult AFSFC/SFC for current American Correctional Association (ACA) guidance. (T-0) 4.2.8.1.  Cells, rooms, and personal hygiene areas must provide adequate lighting. (T-0) 4.2.8.2.  Provide adequate exterior lighting for security and safety. (T-0) 4.2.8.3.  If  interior  lights  are  not  jail/prison  type,  install  wire  mesh  covering  or  safety glass  for  lighting  fixtures  in  confinee  access  areas.  If  old  light  receptacles  need  to  be replaced, use jail/prison type. (T-0) 4.2.8.4.  Provide  battery  powered  emergency  lights  to  illuminate  facility  interior  during power outages. (T-0) 4.2.8.5.  Indoor  Temperatures.  Indoor  temperatures  are  best  prescribed  locally  and maintained at appropriate summer and winter comfort zones similar to non-CFs on base. CF  air  circulation  is  at  least  10  cubic  feet  of  outside  or  re-circulated,  filtered  air  per minute per occupant for confinee cells, control stations, and common areas built prior to Aug  2002.  Facility  additions,  renovations,  or  new  construction  after  Aug  2002,  must provide  at  least  15  cubic  feet  of  outside  or  re-circulated  filtered  air  per  minute.  In  no cases  should  the  air  quantity  be  less  than  five  cubic  feet  per  minute  per  person. AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 45 Regardless  of  facility  construction  date,  triennial  HVAC  surveys  are  necessary. Coordinate with Bio-environmental flight or Civil Engineers for assistance. (T-1) 4.2.8.6.  Noise  Levels.  External  noise  levels  are  to  be  similar  to  levels  in  Airmen dormitories areas. (T-2) 4.2.8.7.  Plumbing  Standards.  Conventional  porcelain  wash  basins  and  toilets,  without water tanks, are appropriate in standard cells or areas. Provide metal, round-edged toilets and  washbasins  in  segregation  cells  equipped  with  self-closing  tamper-proof  valves, index buttons, soap dish, drinking bubbler, and overflow. (T-1) 4.2.8.7.1.  Individual cells have one toilet and one wash basin. (T-1) 4.2.8.7.2.  Dormitory  type  facilities  have  a  minimum  ratio  of:  two  toilets  and  one wash basin for every eight males, and two toilets and one wash basin for every four females,  available on  a  24-hour basis. Urinals  may  be substituted for up  to  one half the toilets in male facilities. (T-1) 4.2.8.7.3.  Built-in shower stalls: A ratio of one shower stall for every eight confinees. Showers  must  have  concealed  and  tamper-proof  supply  fittings,  surface  mounted fixed  jail/prison  type  showerhead,  and  tamper-proof  hot  and  cold  water  valves.  To avoid  injury  from  hot  water,  thermostatically  control  shower  water  temperatures between 100 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit. (T-1) 4.2.8.8.  Sanitation.  Maintain  a  high  standard  of  sanitation.  Inform  confinees  of responsibilities  to  carry  out  daily  routines  necessary  in  keeping  facility  clean  and  neat. Failure by a confinee to maintain a clearly understood standard may be addressed by the Discipline and Adjustments Board (D&A Bd). (T-1) 4.3.  Prohibited Security Measures.  Confinement officers ensure enforcement of the following prohibitions during both the design and operation of the confinement/corrections facility. (T-0) 4.3.1.  Do not use electrically charged fences or wires. (T-0) 4.3.2.  Do  not  house  non-confinees  in  the  facility.  (This  is  not  a  billeting  room  or  a  First Sergeant courtesy dorm room.) (T-0) 4.3.3.  Do not divide visiting areas by any type of barrier. (T-1) 4.3.4.  Do  not  use  "black-out"  cells  (i.e.,  do  not  prevent  proper  level  of  natural/electrical light). (T-0) 4.3.5.  Do not guard confinees with canine teams. Patrol dogs may be used to assist in escape searches and disturbances. Detector dogs may be used to conduct facility contraband checks. (T-0) 4.3.6.  Do not use chemicals (other than riot control agents). (T-0) 4.3.7.  Do  not  use  firearms  to  guard  pretrial  detainees  and  post-trial  inmates,  except  as required outside of the facility while under escort. (T-0) 4.3.8.  Do  not  use  restraining  devices  (e.g.,  leg  irons)  during  employment  to  create  “chain gangs”. (T-0) 46 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 4.3.9.  Do  not  secure  (restrain)  confinees  to  fixed  objects  or  vehicle  interior/exteriors. However, when behavior appropriate, securing to a prison model mobile “restraint” chair is approved for only as long as necessary to move the confinee or awaiting treatment by mental health or medical personnel. (T-0) 4.3.10.  Do not abandon confinees. Maintain 24/7 coverage. (T-0) 4.3.11.  Due to security reasons, confinees are exempt from Physical Training testing during their confinement. Upon release (and if returned to the active force) confinees are given the appropriate  amount  of  time  IAW  their  Service’s  current  testing  guidance  to  be  ready.  The prohibition  in  this  situation  is  because  run  testing  is  done  on  a  track.  Confinees  cannot  be released to run on a track either to maintain conditioning or to take the test. (T-1) 4.3.11.1.  The  prohibition  on  track  use  does  not  prohibit  the  use  of  cardio  equipment  in the CF to maintain basic (non-testable) fitness. (T-1) 4.3.11.2.  For  safety  reasons  free  weights  are  prohibited  in  the  CF  due  to  ability  to  be used as a weapon. A weight “contained” system (e.g., universal gym) may be used. (T-1) 4.4.  Furnishings.  Ensure  one  sleeping  surface  for  each  person.  The  surface  consists  of  a mattress at least 12 inches off the floor; a writing surface and proximate area to sit (required only if confinee is inside more than 10-hours per day); storage space for personal items; and place to suspend  clothes.  Provide  sufficient  furnishings,  consistent  with  confinee  custody  levels,  in  day rooms so every occupant has a seat at one time. (T-0) 4.5.  Equipment.  Staff ensures the following are available/provided (T-1): 4.5.1.  Office equipment to support the administrative function. (T-3) 4.5.2.  Janitorial  supplies  for  use  in  the  facility.  Supplies  (e.g.,  cleansers,  cleaning  powders and liquids or any items clearly marked with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and/or Material  Safety  Data  Sheets  (MSDS)  labels),  are  to  be  secured  and  used  under  close supervision.  Whenever  possible,  try  using  alternative  non-caustic  cleaning  agents  such  as vinegar. (T-1) 4.5.3.  Serviceable  tools  for  approved  confinee  work  projects.  (Develop  an  accountability system.) (T-1) 4.5.4.  A  two-way  intercom  system  (required  for  collocated  cells,  i.e.,  adjacent  to LED/BDOC). (T-0) 4.5.5.  Sufficient  recreational  and  day  room  equipment  such  as  TVs  and/or  radios,  library. (T-1) 4.5.6.  Religious supplies and literature as provided or approved by the installation chaplain. (T-1) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 47 Chapter 5 FACILITY MANAGEMENT 5.1.  Facility Management.  The management of AFCS confinees is a delicate and complex task which  requires  fair,  firm,  and  consistent  leadership  skills  of  Confinement  NCOs  and  staffs.  In most  instances,  AF  CFs  operated  with  one  primary  and  one  alternate  NCO.  Depending  upon facility  size,  MAJCOMs  may  supplement  manpower,  vice  primary  use  of  on-duty  flights  to conduct visitation, deliver meals, provide escorts for base appointments, etc. Confinement NCOs duties are more than a “jailer.” For those installations without facilities, the Confinement NCO is the installation liaison and is responsible for the legal and proper disposition of confinees at other facilities.  The  Confinement  NCO  ensures  all  required  forms  and  database  entries  (i.e.,  SFMIS, NCIC, DIBRs, etc.) are completed by the appropriate authorities in order to build and maintain the required records. Sentencing may add additional requirements to process, e.g., VWAP, Sex Offender Registration/Notification, and DNA collection. The Confinement NCO establishes and maintains  communication  with  confinees,  as  well  as  provides  for  their  safety  and  the  safety  of others. The Confinement NCO provides availability to correctional/rehabilitation programs. The Confinement  NCO  computes  sentences  and  the  Confinement  Officer  audits  the  sentence computations.  The  Confinement  NCO  ensures  all  confinees  have  the  same  access  to  available programming as appropriate for their confinement status, custody classification, etc. (T-0) 5.1.1.  Confinee Status. An individual awaiting the filing of charges, disposition of charges, or trial by court-martial is a pretrial detainee. Subsequent to the sentence being announced in open court, but not yet approved by the CA, the confinee's status is adjudged and becomes a post-trial  inmate.  A  post-trial  inmate  becomes  sentenced  when  the  CA  approves  the  final order. (T-0) 5.1.1.1.  Pretrial. The DD Form 2707, directs pretrial confinement. As part of the process also  complete  AF  Form  444,  Advisement  of  Rights  Upon  Pretrial  Confinement.  Ensure the detainee has the opportunity to review/acknowledge the advisement on the AF Form 444. If the detainee refuses to acknowledge/sign, then annotate the refusal in the provided block.  The  briefing  official  (usually  the  unit  representative  affecting  the  confinement) oversees  completion  of  AF  Form  444  with  the  detainee,  which  is  then  witnessed  by  a confinement/corrections staff member. (Whether the detainee acknowledged or refused to acknowledge  their  rights  on  the  form,  provide  a  copy  of  the  completed  form  to  the detainee  or  when  appropriate  to  their  defense  counsel.)  For  additional  information  on pretrial confinement, see Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM) 304 and 305. When releasing a pretrial  detainee,  the  confinement  officer  consults  with  the  SJA  to  ensure  coordination prior  to  accepting/enforcing  a  DD  Form  2718  release  order  from  an  authorized  official (i.e.,  confining  official).  After  consultation  with  the  SJA  and  if  the  documents  are  in order, release the detainee to a representative from their parent unit. (T-0) 5.1.1.1.1.  NOTE:  DoDD  1325.04,  paragraph  4.7.,  pretrial  detainees  of  any  Service may be placed into a military CF nearest to the court-martial proceedings on a non-reimbursable  basis.  However,  a  prior  negotiated  support  agreement  between  the Services  (or to  codify  agreed  upon installations reimbursements  (staffing, to  appointments,  etc.)  for  detainee incarceration. involved) transportation is  encouraged 48 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 5.1.1.2.  Post-trial. For post-trial inmates, complete DD Form 2707, for each inmate. An authorized  commissioned,  warrant,  or  noncommissioned  officer  may  sign  the  DD  Form 2707,  authorizing  confinement,  see  Articles  9(b)  and  11(a)  of  the  UCMJ  and  MCM, RCM 1101. (T-0) 5.1.2.  In  rare  circumstances installation  commanders,  particularly  from  OCONUS installations  may  temporarily  detain  US  civilians  or  allied  military  members  in  AFCS facilities pending their release to competent authorities. The detention must meet local, host-tenant, or Status of Forces Agreements. Do not cohabitate, co-mingle, or otherwise integrate civilians  or  allied  military  members  with  US  military  members.  The  detainment  of  any person  not  subject  to  the  UCMJ  requires  SJA  coordination  (e.g.,  emergency  or  natural disaster assistance, US Government employees overseas, etc.). (T-0) 5.1.3.  Post-trial  inmates  of  other  Services  (Army,  Navy,  Marines,  or  Coast  Guard)  may  be incarcerated  in  AFCS  facilities,  IAW  DoD  directives  and  other  appropriate  inter-service support agreements. (T-0) 5.1.4.  Confinees  of  other  Services  incarcerated  in  AFCS  facilities  are  subject  to  the procedures  contained  in  this  instruction,  except  as  directed  by  AFSFC/SFC.  It  has  been reciprocally  agreed  among  the  Services  and  placed  in  DoDI  1325.07  that  the  host institutional facility rules apply. (T-0) 5.2.  Confinement  Locations.  All  AF  detainees/inmates  are  confined  within  the  AF  or  DoD corrections  system  according  to  policies  and  procedures  set  forth  in  DoDI  1325.07,  DoDD 1325.04,  and  this  instruction.  See  paragraph  2.1.  for  time  lengths  for  each  configuration. Throughout the AF, there are several housing configurations/confinement capabilities still in use: 5.2.1.  Confinees are housed in a designated on-base CF (1 or more beds). 5.2.2.  Confinees are temporarily housed in a holding cell. 5.2.3.  Confinees are temporarily housed in a detention cell. 5.2.4.  Civilian  Facilities.  When  there  is  no  confinement  on-base  or  circumstances  exist requiring  some/all  confinees  be  housed  off-base,  the  best  practice  is  to  do  so  via  contract. Conduct confinement processing actions prior to the need for off base incarceration. Ensure confinees receive the civilian facility’s  rulebook along with information on military contact procedures to communicate with First Sergeant, Chaplain, IG, legal, etc. Monitor confinees’ welfare  and  safety  while  in  the  civilian  facility.  The  confinement  POC  provides  liaison  for the  installation  to  the  civilian  facility.  Even  if  organic  capability  exists  on  base,  pre-negotiating  a  contract  with  the  local  jurisdiction  will  make  it  ready  for  use  should  an emergent  situation  arise  (overcrowding,  gender  population  mix).  NOTE:  AFSFC  highly recommends separating co-conspirators whether pre- or post-trial).  (T-1) 5.2.4.1.  When housing off-base, ensure to the maximum extent possible that the military confinee is separated from illegal aliens/foreign nationals (reference Art. 12, UCMJ) and not comingled with civilians (or other military) with the opposite pre- or post-trial status (reference Art 13, UCMJ). (T-0) 5.2.5.  Temporary  on  base  housing  option.  When  space  is  not  readily  available,  while awaiting  a  transfer  to  a  more  permanent  housing  solution,  consider  on-base  confinement using a guarded dorm/billeting room. This should be a pre-planned option. Ensure the room AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 49 is  sanitized,  by  removing  all  excess  furniture,  lamps/phones  (cords),  paintings,  etc.  Post guards  (IAW  custody  classification)  as  appropriate  to  prevent  escape  (covering  doors  and windows). Use special post instructions, portable radio and/or cell phone according to local guidance. This option is likely to be manpower intensive reinforcing the temporary nature of its use. Do not use this temporary method for identified suicide risk confinees. (T-1) 5.2.6.  Pretrial Detainees: Under most situations, pre-trial detainees are housed on or nearby the installation. AFSFC/SFC approves deviations from local place of confinement and directs detainee transfers as appropriate. (T-0) 5.2.7.  Post-trial (Male) Inmates with a sentence over 10 years, including sentences of death: Male  inmates  (officer,  enlisted,  or  cadet)  under  these  sentences  are  housed  at  the  US Disciplinary  Barracks  (USDB),  Ft  Leavenworth  KS,  or  as  determined  by  the  Director,  AF Corrections  (per  Army  Instructions,  sentences  must  be  at  least  10  years  and  one  day  upon arrival  at  the  USDB).  Requests  for  housing  inmates  in  other  Army  corrections  facilities require  AFSFC/SFC  to  coordinate  and  obtain  approval  from  Army  Corrections  Command 48-hours prior to transfer. (T-0) 5.2.8.  Post-trial (Male) Inmates with a sentence greater than one year but less than 10 years: Male inmates (officer, enlisted, or cadet) with sentences of more than one year but less than 10  years  normally  serve  their  sentences  at  a  Level  II  facility  or  as  determined  by AFSFC/SFC. (T-0) 5.2.8.1.  It is often possible to move male inmates with less than a one year sentence to a Level  II  Facility,  if  bed  space  is  available  and  the  inmate  arrives  with  at  least  90  days remaining until Minimum Release Date (MRD). Check with AFSFC/SFC for assistance. (T-0) 5.2.8.2.  For  planning  purposes,  normally,  male  inmates  with  appropriate  Level  II sentence  lengths  can  be  arranged  to  be  moved  within  30  days  of  receipt  of  the  courts-martial order (CMO). 5.2.9.  Post-trial  (Female):  Female  inmates  (officer,  enlisted,  or  cadet)  under  sentence  of death  or  with  a  sentence  of  more  than  90  days  remaining  until  MRD  usually  serve  their sentences at the Naval Consolidated Brig Miramar CA, or as determined by AFSFC/SFC. (T-0) 5.2.9.1.  For  planning  purposes,  normally,  female  inmates  with  appropriate  Level  II sentence lengths can be arranged to be moved within 30 days of receipt of the CMO. 5.2.10.  In  rare  circumstances,  confinees  in  previously  high-profile  positions  (e.g.,  senior leadership)  in  pretrial  or  post-trial  status  may  present  a  unique  housing  problem.  The  DFC should  coordinate  with  AFSFC/SFC  for  guidance/assistance  and  possible  acceleration  of post-trial transfer. (T-1) 5.3.  Confinee  Status.  In  the  AFCS,  a  confinee’s  status  is  immediately  determined  as  either pretrial  or  post-trial.  Pretrial  detainees  are  automatically  classified  as  maximum  custody classification. (T-0) 5.3.1.  NOTE:  The need to incarcerate a pretrial detainee means presence of a flight risk or a risk to harm self/others and therefore is graded as maximum custody. 50 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 5.4.  Initial  Confinee  Custody  Classifications.  When inprocessing a post-trial inmate use DD Form 2710  and DD Form  2711. For initial  custody  classifications, the  confinement officer  and NCO  use  DoDI  1325.07,  Appendix  1  to  Enclosure  2,  Offense  Severity  Scale,  to  produce  the severity points to determine the initial custody classification as either medium or maximum (the DD Form 2711, Mar 2013 version in block 7, incorrectly reads “medium-in” when it should read “medium”).  Initial  consideration  is  primarily  focused  on  seriousness  of  the  offense,  history  of violence,  history  of  escape,  outstanding  detainers  or  warrants,  substance  abuse,  as  well  as physical and mental health evaluation(s). Be aware that lengthy sentences or recently adjudicated sentences  of  any  length  often  result  in  a  sense  of  desperation  (suicide/escape).  For  post-trial inmates,  the  DFC  may  decide  to  increase  or  decrease  an  initial  custody  classification  by documenting  their  rationale  in  block  8b  of  the  DD  Form  2711,  using  consideration  of  stability factors (e.g., age, residence, employment history, family ties) and any history of past civilian or military criminal record. NOTE: Refer to Chapter 8 for custody reclassifications (adjustments). (T-0) 5.4.1.  Maximum  Custody.  Possess  serious  significant  risk  of  escape  or  harm  to  self/others. Demonstrates  behavior  disruptive  (noncompliant)  to  the  operation  of  the  facility.  Avoid removing from the facility except in emergencies or unusual circumstances. Assign quarters to ensure maximum control and supervision. Unless a D&A Bd modified their privileges, a maximum  custody  confinee  has  the  same  dayroom  and  recreation  yard  privileges  as  those classified as minimum and medium; however, do not co-mingle maximum custody confinees with other confinees, regardless of custody classification. (T-1) 5.4.1.1.  NOTE:  Conduct  these  privileges  at  opposite  times,  e.g.,  maximum  custody confinee  could  be  at  rec  call  while  other  lower  custody  confinees  are  in  day  room  and vice  versa.  It  is  obviously  manpower  intensive  to  observe  and  secure  multiple  custody levels simultaneously, use parent unit augmentation as necessary. 5.4.2.  Medium  Custody.  Possess  moderate  risk  of  escape  or  harm  toward  self/others.  Has shown  adjustment  to  confinement  and  controlled  institutional  living.  If  authorized  by  the DFC,  may  be  assigned  work  details  outside  the  facility  under  continuous  escort  and supervision. 5.4.3.  Minimum Custody. Possess minimal risk of escape or harm to self/others. Has shown successful  adjustment  to  confinement  and  controlled  institutional  living.  Considered  to  be sufficiently dependable. If authorized by the DFC, may be assigned work details outside the facility under minimal supervision. 5.4.4.  Installation  Custody  or  Trustee.  The  AFCS  does  not  use  this  custody  classification. The  DoD  designed  this  custody  classification  for  inmates  who  have  demonstrated  years  of exceptional conduct and behavior throughout their incarceration (usually in Level III). (T-1) 5.5.  Quarters  Assignment.  Assigning  quarters  is  based  upon  division  by  gender,  status, custody classification, and housing category. Separate by gender, then by pre- or post-trial status, and  then  by  custody  classification  (maximum  from  minimum/medium),  then  by  housing category.  The  housing  categories  used  by  AFCS  are  general  population,  administrative segregation  (including  medical  issues/recuperation),  and  disciplinary  segregation.  NOTE  1: Same  gender  post-trial  inmates  in  general  population  with  custody  classifications  of  minimum and medium may be mixed in quarters assignments. NOTE 2: There are additional requirements AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 51 under  PREA.  Follow  the  requirements  of  PREA  Resource  Checklists  available  on  AFSFC website under Corrections. (T-0) 5.5.1.  Facility sections designated for housing female confinees are  required to  provide for separation  by  sight  and  sound  of  berthing  and  personal  hygiene  areas  from  male  confinees and vice versa. (T-0) 5.5.1.1.  NOTE  1:  Mixed gender post-trial  inmates who have custody  classifications of minimum  and  medium  may  share  meals/dayroom/recreation  yard  privileges,  provided there is sufficient direct staff supervision. 5.5.1.2.  NOTE  2:  There  are  additional  requirements  under  PREA.  Follow  the requirements  of  PREA  Resource  Checklists  available  on  AFSFC  website  under Corrections. 5.5.1.3.  NOTE  3:  The  AF  regards  sound  separation  in  berthing  and  hygiene  areas  as necessary  to  prevent  any  cross  gender  communication  which  is  at  or  below  a  normal conversation level.  Sounds louder than this are likely able to  be intercepted by the staff and thus reported. 5.5.2.  Officer  and  enlisted  separation.  Although  the  DoD  no  longer  requires  post-trial separation of former officers from former enlisted, Level I facility staffs may still face unique challenges. DFCs should consider the following issues when determining if separate quarters are  advantageous  for  the  mission:  previously  in  the  staff’s  chain-of-command,  previous personal  familiarity  with  the  staff,  and  other  interpersonal  associations.  Regardless  of  post-trial  inmate’s  previous  rank,  they  do  not  hold  positions  of  authority  nor  supervise  any confinees. Properly engaging and deciding these factors preserves the safety and security of the  facility,  as  well  as  limits  any  negative  effects  concerning  the  morale/welfare  and  good order/discipline of the installation. Remember, pretrial detainees (whether officer or enlisted) are considered maximum custody and thus not mingled with others. 5.5.3.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible  house  pretrial  detainees  in  cells  or  berthing  areas separated by sight and sound from post-trial inmates. (T-1) 5.5.4.  Disciplinary  Segregation  Category.  Disciplinary  segregation  is  a  formal  disciplinary punishment  measure  causing  separation  from  the  general  population.  Placement  may  be immediately  after  a  serious  behavior  or  rules  violation  which  the  Confinement  Officer determines  is  in  the  best  interest  of  safety  and  facility  operations  while  awaiting  a  formal D&A Bd hearing and/or placement as a result of a recommended disciplinary action from the D&A Bd. (T-0) 5.5.5.  Administrative  Segregation  Category.  Upon  arrival,  place  new  confinees in administrative  segregation  at  a  minimum  for  the  first  24-hours.  This  allows  time  for  staff observation  and  confinee  acclamation.  After  the  initial  24-hours,  confinement  officer conducts a review of the new arrival(s) to determine removal of administrative segregation or continuation for additional 48-hours (up to72-hours). On the first subsequent duty day after 72-hours  expired,  the  DFC,  or  designee  in  their  absence,  verbally  (face  to  face)  formally advises  the  confinee  of  any  decision  and  reasons  to  continue  initial  administrative segregation  beyond  the  initial  in-processing  period.  (Document  the  reasons  and  decision  in the  CTF).  Other  than  initial  arrival,  additional  administrative  segregation  reasons  may include:  protective  custody  (voluntary  or  involuntary),  prevention  of  injury  by  others, 52 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 pending an investigation, behavioral observation, or for medical reasons.  Frequently review these  cases  in  an  effort  to  keep  the  use  of  these  restrictions  to  a  minimum.  Confinees involuntarily  placed  in  administrative  segregation  are  afforded  the  same  programs,  work outlets,  privileges  as  the  general  population  and  this  involuntarily  period  should  not ordinarily  exceed  a  period  of  30  days  without  the  confinee’s  consent  (contact  AFSFC/SFC for transfer options and resolution assistance.) All confinees in administrative segregation are afforded  the  same  cell  furnishings  as  those  not  segregated.  The  confinement  officer  or designee determines when temporary removal of furnishings is necessary to prevent injury or property damage. Administratively segregation confinees are afforded the same dayroom and recreational  privileges  as  those  in  general  population,  e.g.,  it  may  be  necessary  to  design  a schedule  to  separately  use  the  same  resources.  NOTE:  See  DoDI  1325.07,  Enclosure  2, Paragraph 10 for additional medical requirements and segregation timeline requirements.(T-0) 5.5.5.1.  Maximum  custody  confinees  individually  perform  proportional  in-facility housekeeping  of  common  areas  (dayroom,  latrine,  laundry,  etc.).  Follow  appropriate security measures. (T-1) 5.5.6.  Within  the  facility,  medium  and  minimum  custody  confinees  may  share  meals, recreation, and housekeeping of common areas (dayroom, latrine, laundry, etc.) at the same time. Ensure appropriate levels of supervision are per the highest custody classification.  (T-1) 5.5.7.  Death Sentence Inmates (DSI). All DSIs are always maximum custody and are placed in  administrative  segregation  until  transferred  to  Level  III.  Contact  AFSFC/SFC  for procedures  and  coordination  with  the  Army  concerning  death  sentence  transfers  as commercial  airlines  will  not  transport.  (Historically,  MilAir  has  been  used  to  transport.) Segregate DSIs from the remainder of the population at  all times. Do not allow them to  be commingled with any non-DSI inmates in housing, recreation, and mealtime while awaiting transfer  to  Level  III.  The  SECAF,  IAW  DoDD  1325.04.,  paragraph  5.3.7.,  for  DSIs  under their charge, is responsible to provide oversight, management, and resources for executions. This involves a Service wide response effort including, support from Air Force level JA, SG, PA, A1, and A4. Specific guidelines will be coordinated within the AF, and separately with the Army, as determined for each case after the President signs the Death Warrant. (T-0) 5.5.8.  Long-term military corrections facilities are the only authorized place to confine DSIs. During times of war, the SECAF may designate other facilities for such confinements. (T-0) 5.6.  Sentence  Computation  and  Abatement.  The  accurate  computation  of  sentences  ensures proper  administration.  It  is  also  an  essential  element  in  protecting  inmate  legal  rights.  The confinement  NCO  computes  sentences  by  determining  good  conduct  time  (GCT),  earned  time (ET),  and  special  acts  abatement  (SAA).  For  sentences  adjudged  on  26  Jul  2004  or  before, contact  the  USDB  or  AFSFC/SFC  where  copies  of  the  AFJI  31-215,  Armed  Forces  Joint Instruction,  Military  Sentences  to  Confinement,  dated  1964  are  maintained  for  those  under  its jurisdiction.  For  sentences  adjudged  on  27  Jul  2004  or  after,  IAW  DoDI  1325.07,  use  DoD 1325.7-M, DoD Sentence Computation, Chapter 2, to calculate sentences. In either case, use the DD  Form  2710-1,  Inmate  Sentence  Information,  or  a  computer-generated  equivalent  to  show math  work  on  sentence  calculations.  NOTE:  The  paragraphs  contained  in  5.6.1.  –  5.6.8.1.4. AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 53 below provide a quick reference to the format. For more in depth information, refer to the DoDI and DoDM which take precedence. (T-1) 5.6.1.  The confinement start date (CSD). The adjudged court-martial date marks the CSD. If an inmate served pretrial confinement for the offense(s) for which the sentence was imposed, the  CSD  is  to  be  administratively  adjusted  to  reflect  the  time  spent  in  pretrial  confinement and any additional pretrial confinement credit ordered by the military judge, or granted later by the CA or an appellate court. Compute and determine the maximum release date (MxRD) and  project  a  minimum  release  date  (MRD)  using  all  anticipated  GCT.  For  inmates  with sentences  of  one  year  or  more,  determine  the  disposition  board  due  date  and  parole  and clemency eligibility date. (T-0) 5.6.2.  Eligibility for GCT. It is awarded to inmates serving a sentence imposed by a court-martial for a definite term of confinement. NOTE: Time served at a civilian facility under a SA or contract is still calculated under military GCT rules. Do not use civilian facility rules for this calculation. (T-1) 5.6.2.1.  Pretrial  detainees  earn  GCT  for  confinement  served,  but  it  is  held  in  abeyance and awarded if an adjudged sentence to confinement is ordered. Calculate GCT Credit for all pretrial time served. (T-0) 5.6.2.2.  GCT is not awarded to inmates with a life, life without parole, or death sentence. The  GCT  is  earned  but,  held  in  abeyance  and  awarded  if  the  sentence  is  reduced  to  a determinate length. (T-0) 5.6.2.3.  Rate  of  earning.  GCT  is  awarded  at  a  rate  of  5  days  for  each  month  of confinement,  and  for  that  portion  of  any  sentence  to  confinement  not  expressed  in  full years and months (1 day for each 6-day portion of a month, see Table 5.1.), regardless of sentence or multiple sentence length. (T-0)  5.6.2.3.1.  Calculating  GCT.  Use  the  sentence  length  and  apply  the  following formula: number of years x 12 + number of months = total months, then take the total months x GCT rate + partial month credit = eligible GCT for sentence length. (T-0) 5.6.2.3.1.1.  For sentences expressed in days, use the calendar method to precisely convert the sentence length to years, months, and days. (T-0) 5.6.2.3.1.2.  For  sentences  expressed  in  days  that  are  less  than  31  days,  use  the partial earnings chart, Table 5.1., to determine the total GCT. (T-0)   54 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 Table 5.1.  Partial Month Rate of Earning Table. Number of Days  GCT  Number of Days GCT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30/31 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5.6.2.3.1.3.  Sentences  expressed  in  days  at  31  days  or  greater,  apply  the following example: a sentence of confinement for 40 days is adjudged on 6 Dec 2004. Calculation is to subtract the adjudged date from the unadjusted maximum release  date  (UMxRD).  Utilize  DoD  1325.7-M  for  sentence  expiration  tables  to calculate the UMxRD. (T-0) Table 5.2.  Expiration Tables to Calculate the UMxRD. YYYY MM DD     Expiration Table  Adjudged on       2004    12    06 +               40    Sentence UMxRD   2005    01    15 38327 +    40 38367 5.6.2.3.1.3.1.  The forty-day sentence computes to 1 month and 9 days. Table 5.3.  Forty-Day Sentence Calculation  UMxRD Adjudged on    YYYY MM DD   2005    01    15 - 2004    12    06                 1      9 5.6.2.3.1.4.  During subtraction, if it becomes necessary to borrow from a column (depicted  below),  care  should  be  taken  to  borrow  the  correct  amount.  When borrowing  from  years  to  add  to  months,  simply  subtract  one  year  from  the  year column and add 12 months to the month column. (T-0)   AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 55 Table 5.4.  Example: Subtract 31 Oct 2004 from 31 Jan 2005. YYYY MM DD  YYYY MM DD     YYYY MM DD   2005   01   31 - 2004  10    31    2005    01   31        -1 +12           2004    13   31  2004   13   31 -2004   10   31  0000   03   00 5.6.2.3.1.5.  When borrowing from the month column to add to the days column, the  specific  number  of  days  for  the  previous  month  will  be  used.  Example: subtract 2 Oct 2004 from 1 Dec 2004. Because there are 30 days in Nov, 30 days were added to the day column and one month subtracted from the month column. (T-0) Table 5.5.  Borrowing From the Month Column to Add to the Days Column. YYYY MM DD  YYYY MM DD  YYYY MM DD  2004   12    01 -2004   10   02    2004    11   31  2004    12    01               -1 +30        -2004   10    02  2004    11    31  0000    01   29 5.6.2.3.1.5.1.  Example:  subtract  30  Jan  2005  from  25  Mar  2005.  Because there  are  29  days  in  a  February  leap  year,  29  days  were  added  to  the  day column. Table 5.6.  Example: Subtract 30 Jan 2005 from 25 Mar 2005 YYYY MM DD     YYYY MM DD  YYYY MM DD  2005    02    54  2005    03    25 -2005    01    30 -2005    01    30  0000    01    24  2005    03    25              -1 +29   2005    02    54 5.6.2.3.1.5.2.  When  borrowing  both  from  months  and  years,  borrow  from months first, then years. Example: subtract 15 Dec 2004 from 2 Apr 2005. Table 5.7.  Borrowing Both from Months and Years  YYYY MM DD  YYYY MM DD  2005    04    02   2005    04    02              -1   +31  -2004    12    15       2005    03    33  YYYY MM DD  YYYY  MM  DD  2005    03    33       -1 +12    00  2004    15    33  2004    15    33 -2004    12    15   0000    03    18 5.6.2.3.1.6.  To determine the number of days required to place in the day column, you must subtract one month from the month column and then carry the number days  (i.e.,  28,  29,  30,  31)  equal  to  the  calendar  month  in  which  you  subtracted. For  example,  since  there  are  31  days  in  March,  31  days  were  added  to  the  day column and one month was subtracted. Then 12 months were added to the month column and one year subtracted from the year column. (T-0) 5.6.2.3.1.7.  When  borrowing  a  month,  it  may  be  necessary  to  adjust  the  year column.  In  this  example,  December  is  in  a  previous  year,  the  year  column  was adjusted  to  reflect  that  year.  There  are  31  days  in  December,  so  31  days  were 56 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 added to the day column. (T-0) Table 5.8.  Calendar Day Example.

Administration.  DFCs  should  ensure  personnel  responsible  for computation  of  sentence  expiration  dates  are  well  prepared  for  the  task.  The primary purpose being to ensure inmates are not held in confinement beyond their proper release date nor released before that date. (T-0) 5.6.2.3.1.8.1.  Calculate  an  anticipated  release  date  at  the  beginning  of  the sentence based upon the GCT that could be earned for the entire period of the sentence or sentences. GCT reduces an inmate’s release date on a day-for-day basis. (T-0) 5.6.2.3.1.8.2.  If a sentence to  confinement is later reduced either by the CA, Appellate  Court,  or  due  to  a  grant  of  clemency,  then  the  release  date  is recomputed  based  upon  the  new  sentence.  Inmates  whose  original  sentences were  computed  under  AFJI  31-215  (superseded)  and  whose  retrial  or rehearing  sentence  was  adjudged  on  27  Jul  2004  or  after,  retain  all  GCT earned up to the date the sentence or conviction was set aside. After the retrial or  rehearing  sentence  is  adjudged,  GCT  is  earned  in  accordance  with  DoDI 1325.07  and  DOD  1325.7-M.  Reference  DoD  1325.7-M,  paragraphs  c2.8.1. and  c2.8.2.,  for  further  computation  instructions  using  applicable  adjudged dates. (T-0) 5.6.2.3.1.8.3.  A  parolee  or  supervised to confinement earns GCT at  the rate applicable to  the sentence in  effect  at  the time of the violation of parole or supervised release. (T-0) release  violator returned 5.6.3.  Earned time (ET). ET is only awarded when overall work or rehabilitation evaluations are  average  or  higher  on  military  affiliated  work  or  military  conducted  rehabilitation  or treatment. A maximum of 5 days ET per month may be awarded within the work program’s component  of  ET  and  a  maximum  of  3  days  ET  per  month  may  be  awarded  within  the rehabilitation or treatment program’s component of ET for a total of 8 days. Inmates whom do  not  enroll,  maintain  progress,  or  complete  available  offense-related  rehabilitation  or maintenance  programs  cannot  be  awarded  ET.  Inmates  on  a  waiting  list  for  an  offense-related  rehabilitation  or  maintenance  program  are  awarded  for  that  program  once participation  begins.  NOTE:  Under  appropriate  supervision,  working  at  a  job  outlet  or working base details qualifies as a work program. (T-0) 5.6.3.1.  Inmates confined in military CFs shall be subject to the ET rules of the confining facility regardless of their military service affiliation. (T-0) 5.6.3.2.  Eligibility.  Inmates  serving  a  sentence  imposed  by  courts-martial  for  a  definite term of confinement are eligible to earn ET. (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 57 5.6.3.2.1.  Pretrial detainees are ineligible for ET. (T-0) 5.6.3.2.2.  Inmates  with  a  life  or  death  sentence  can  earn  ET,  but  such  abatement  is held in abeyance and only awarded if the sentence is reduced to a determinate length. (T-0) 5.6.3.2.3.  Rate of earning. Eligible inmates may be awarded up to 8 days per month ET for participation  and graded effort in  authorized components. With 5 days GCT, and possible 8 days for work, rehabilitation/education programs make for a maximum possible of 13 days earned per month. Example: for this illustration, compute Inmate Smith’s  sentence  on  31  Jan  2005  to  allow  ET  abatement  to  be  included.  Scenario: Inmate  Smith  was  adjudged  on  6  Dec  2004  at  Kunsan  AB  ROK  with  a  180-day sentence. Smith’s sentence was computed on 30 Apr 2005. Smith’s UMxRD is 4 Jun 2005,  making  Smith’s  MxRD  3 Jun  2005.  Smith’s  GCT  for  180-day  sentence  is  30 days at a rate of 5 days per month for 6 months or 4 May 2005. Smith was transferred (crossed the international dateline) from Kunsan AB, ROK to CONUS, causing a day to be subtracted, so the Adjusted Maximum Release Date (AMxRD) is 3 May 2005. Smith  has  participated  in  work  programs  and  fulfilled  requirements  to  earn  5  days during the fourth month (inmates cannot earn ET during last 30 days of their sentence to allow for final computations) of sentence, but did not participate in rehabilitation or education programs. (T-0) 5.6.3.2.3.1.  NOTE  : Ensure one day is credited in all calculations (Consult DoD 1325.7-M,  paragraph  c2.1.4).  Crossing  the  international  dateline  (IDL)  may require  a  modification  to  an  inmate’s  sentence  when  transferring  depending  on route traveled (consult DoD 1325.7-M, paragraph c2.3.).

AFSFC/SFC  delegates  DFC’s  the  authority  to  determine  the  activities eligible  for  ET  at  the  facility.  Publish  the  activities  list  and  make  available  to  all inmates. (T-0) 5.6.3.2.5.  Inmates may participate in activities during a given month that make them eligible  for  more  than  8  days  ET,  but  only  a  maximum  of  8  days  ET  may  be awarded per month. (T-0) 58 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 5.6.3.2.6.  Incremental and proportional rates are authorized when an inmate engages in an approved activity for a portion of a month. Awards are in full days, no fractions. (T-0) 5.6.3.2.7.  ET  is  not  to  be  awarded  within  30  days  of  the  scheduled  confinement release  date  to  allow  out-  processing  and  travel  arrangements  for  a  specific  date. Adjust MRD (factoring in granted or forfeited ET) monthly. File a copy of DD Form 2710-1, in the CTF. (T-0) 5.6.3.2.8.  ET administration. ET is recorded separately from GCT. Such records are entered  into  the  Security  Forces  Management  Information  System  (SFMIS)  or  an automated equivalent. (T-0) 5.6.3.2.9.  When calculating an inmate’s anticipated release date, do not count ET that “potentially could” be earned during the sentence. (T-0) 5.6.3.2.10.  Recommendations for award of ET is made by the confinement NCO or confinement officer for the DFC to approve, in full or in part, with justifications for disapproved times. (T-0) 5.6.3.2.11.  ET  is  awarded,  within  authorized  limits,  through  evaluation  of  the separate  ET  program  components.  Evaluation  of  each  component  is  documented  on AF Form 4454, Earned Time and Special Acts Abatement Worksheet, or an automated equivalent  at  monthly  intervals.  This  time  reduces  a  release  date  on  a  day-for-day basis.  Counsel  inmates  on  their  performance  during  the  monthly  review  period  and inform them of ET awarded by the DFC. (T-1) 5.6.3.3.  All  post-trial  inmates  in  a  CF,  unless  precluded  from  doing  so  because  of  a security,  disciplinary,  medical,  or  other  reason  determined  appropriate  by  the  DFC, should be engaged in useful employment under appropriate supervision. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.1.  Inmates  are  employed  in  maintenance,  support,  or  vocational  training activities  that  provide  work  of  a  useful,  constructive  nature,  consistent  with  their custody  classification,  physical/mental  condition,  behavior,  confining  offense, sentence,  status,  previous  training,  individual  confinement  requirements,  and installation/facility needs. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.2.  Inmates,  not  engaged  in  prescribed  rehabilitation,  training,  or  counseling perform  the  balance  of  a  full  day’s  work  schedule  in  useful,  constructive  work. Attending prescribed rehabilitation, training, or counseling classes does not limit the authority of DFCs to direct extra work during emergencies, prevent the assignment of necessary  details  that  normally  encompass  weekends,  or  prevent  volunteering  for extra work. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.2.1.  NOTE:  See paragraph 11.1 for additional information on work week schedules. 5.6.3.3.3.  Reception, orientation, and pre-release processing qualify as work. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.4.  Offense-related  or  other  rehabilitation  programs.  ET  is  awarded  by conscientiously participating (i.e., progressing) in programs. To the maximum extent possible, ET programs address problems associated with an inmate’s criminal activity AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 59 or  behavior.  Reference  paragraph  11.3,  training,  treatment,  transition  program (TTTP). (T-0) 5.6.3.3.5.  Education. ET is awarded for civilian education, including, but not limited to, vocational education sequences, general equivalency diplomas, or post-secondary degrees or credits if the conferring institution has been accredited/recognized by the US Department of Education. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.6.  Participation  in  non-traditional  sources  of  educational  credit  (e.g.,  CLEP, DANTES,  ACT,  and  military  education)  may  qualify  for  award  of  ET  when authorized by the DFC. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.7.  Time  spent  obtaining  a  certificate,  license,  diploma,  degree,  or  post-secondary credits is  generally in  addition to the normal workweek for which ET for work  can  be  earned,  unless  such  coursework  is  related  to  vocational  training  and education. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.8.  ET may be awarded for coursework performed by correspondence. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.9.  Once an education objective is achieved, additional ET is not awarded for that objective. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.10.  To be eligible for higher education ET, the objectives must be identified in writing and pre-authorized by the DFC. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.11.  Self-Improvement  and  Personal  Growth.  ET  is  awarded  for  self-improvement and personal growth programs that have been identified in writing and pre-authorized by the DFC. (T-0) 5.6.3.3.12.  Support Activities. ET is awarded for participation in support activities, to include  community  service  programs,  special  projects,  and  work  assignments supportive  of  institutional  goals  or  missions,  volunteer  work,  and  for  extraordinary achievements that do not rise to the level of awards for special acts abatement. (T-0) 5.6.4.  Special  Acts  Abatement  (SAA).  SAA  is  a  deduction  from  an  inmate’s  release  date earned extraordinary humanitarianism, institutional/community support deemed appropriate by the DFC. (T-0) heroism, specific for a act of or 5.6.4.1.  SAA  Eligibility.  Inmates  serving  a  sentence  imposed  by  a  court-martial  for  a definite term of confinement are eligible for SAA. (T-0) 5.6.4.1.1.  For inmates  with approved findings of guilty for  an offense that occurred on/after  1  Oct  2004,  the  award  of  SAA  is  conditioned  on  the  inmate  submitting  an acceptable release plan and fully cooperating in all other respects with MSR policy of DoDI 1325.07. (T-0) 5.6.4.1.2.  Pretrial detainees are not eligible for SAA. (T-0) 5.6.4.1.3.  Inmates  with  life,  life  without  parole,  or  death  sentences  may  earn  SAA, but  such  abatement  is  held  in  abeyance  and  awarded  if  the  sentence  is  reduced  to  a determinate sentence length. (T-0) 5.6.4.2.  Rate of Earning. DFCs authorize a maximum of 2 days of SAA per month for a  period  not  to  exceed  12  months  for  a  single  special  act.  At  no  time  can  an  inmate 60 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 receive  more  than  2  days  of  SAA  per  month;  additional  special  acts  may  extend  the period of abatement, not the rate of earning. (T-0) 5.6.4.3.  Administration. SAA reduces release date on a day-for-day basis as earned. (T-0) 5.6.5.  Monthly abatement  limits.  Limit the total amount of all types of  abatement  of GCT, ET, and SAA awarded for any one month not to exceed 15 days. (T-0) 5.6.6.  Acknowledgment  of  Conditional  Award  of  Abatements.  During  in-processing, inmates  who  have  an  approved  finding  of  guilty,  for  an  offense  that  occurred  after  1  Oct 2004,  acknowledge  in  writing  that  the  award  of  GCT,  ET,  or  SAA  is  conditioned  on submitting  an  acceptable  release  plan  and  fully  cooperating  in  all  other  respects  with  the MSR  policy  of  DoDI  1325.07.  The  acknowledgement  should  also  state  that  if  the  DFC determines  that  this  condition  has  not  been  met,  deductions  from  the  release  date  for conditionally awarded GCT, ET, or SAA will be voided. (T-0) 5.6.7.  Forfeiture  and  restoration  of  abatements.  As  a  consequence  of  violations  of institutional rules or the uniform code of military justice award credits may be forfeited. The DFC (or any future military CF commander) may restore the credit awards as a management tool to encourage compliance. (T-0) 5.6.7.1.  Confinement facilities use a D&A Bd for forfeitures. (T-0) 5.6.7.2.  Only abatement that has actually been earned before or on the date of a violation is  subject  to  forfeiture.  GCT subtracted from the release date, but  not  yet  earned, is  not subject to forfeiture. (T-0) 5.6.7.3.  Order of forfeiture, generally GCT will be forfeited prior to forfeiture of ET, and ET will be forfeited prior to forfeiture of SAA. (T-0) 5.6.7.4.  Sentences that have expired with allowance for GCT, ET, and SAA may not be revived for the purpose of forfeiting GCT, ET, and SAA earned thereon. (T-0) 5.6.7.4.1.  NOTE:  This  “expired”  situation  is  more  common  for  those  serving consecutive courts-martial sentences to confinement. 5.6.7.5.  Earned GCT for pretrial detainees is subject to forfeiture in the same manner as post-trial inmates; however, hold forfeitures in abeyance until a sentence to confinement begins. (T-0) 5.6.8.  Delivery of Promulgating Order. The confinement officer or designated representative will read the approved sentence to an inmate upon receipt of the inmate’s court-martial order (CA’s  approved  final  order)  promulgating  the  sentence  and  any  order  of  remission, suspension, or vacation.  The inmate will acknowledge that the order was read by  signing  a statement containing the date of acknowledgement and the name and grade of the person that read  the  order.  Place  the  signed  order  in  the  CTF.  If  an  inmate  refuses  to  sign,  the confinement  officer  or  a  designated  representative  will  annotate  accordingly.  Any administrative corrections to the final orders received by the facility after the inmate is placed on excess leave will be mailed, return receipt requested, to the member's leave address. (T-0) 5.7.  Confinement  Facility  (CF)  Assessments  by  Military  Treatment  Facility  (MTF)  and Medical  Liaison  Officer  Appointments.  The  local  MTF  and  CF  develop  a  Memorandum  of AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 61 Agreement  (MOA)  between  the  two  units  to  define  roles  and  responsibilities  to  assure  quality medical care, oversight, and effective communication flow. The MOA at a minimum, addresses effective processes related to: medical and mental health appointments, limitations of confinees, physical profiles of confinees, medication handling and disposal procedures, emergency medical response  procedures,  and  24-hr  points  of  contact.  The  local  MTF  Commander  appoints  in writing,  a  qualified  provider  and  alternate  to  serve  additional  duty  as  Medical  Liaison  Officers (MLO)  with  the  CF.  The  MLO  coordinates  medical  care  for  confinees  and  promotes  mutual dialogue between the CF and MTF to ensure healthcare quality, access, and safety for confinees. Each confinee will have a plan of medical care documented for the duration of their confinement. NOTE: The confinement NCO can provide rosters of confinees (as applicable) to the designated Primary  Care  Management  (PCM)  team  to  assist  in  proactive  confinee  care  processes  and continued communication between units. (T-1) 5.7.1.  Security  and  Administering  of  Medication  and  Medication  Devices  (e.g.,  syringes, needles,  etc.).  Under  higher  medical  headquarters’  guidance  and  local  MTF  pharmacy assistance, the confinement officer develops staff procedures that address: ordering, receipt, storage,  security,  inventory,  accountability,  return,  administration,  and  distribution  of medication  and  medication  devices.  For  hospital  accreditation  and  inspection  purposes,  Air Force  Medical  Operations  Agency  (AFMOA)  requires  a  MTF  pharmacy  technician  in  a  7-skill  level  or  above  train  confinement  staff,  as  appropriate,  in  the  proper  security/storage, handling,  disposal,  and  administration  of  medications  and  medication  devices  for  use  by confinees. Document this training in the staff member’s Air Force Training Records utilizing the AF Form 623a and the AF Form 797. All medication and medication devices will only be administered or distributed in accordance with the healthcare provider’s medical order. (T-1) 5.7.2.  As  part  of  the  pre-Court-Martial  physical  assessment,  the  MTF  designated  care provider  determines  whether  or  not  the  confinee  can  take/use  prescribed  medication  by  an observed  self-administered  process.  The  screening  healthcare  provider  ensures  only medications  required  during  confinement  are  prescribed  for  confinee  by  conducting  a rigorous medication reconciliation process prior to confinement. (T-1) 5.7.2.1.  NOTE:  When  notified  of  a  scheduled/pending  court  martial  it  is  beneficial  to all parties (CF, MTF and the accused) to conduct a health assessment of the accused prior to the trial date. If a finding of guilty is returned by the court, this preparation will assist the medical officer when conducting the post-trial’s fit for confinement physical. 5.7.3.  The MTF ensures there is an assessment of capability to safely provide medical care support  for  the  confinee  within  the  confinement  facility.  If  on  site  medical  supervision  is required for medication administration, or other ongoing medical care, consider moving to a Level II facility or civilian CF that has organic medical support. (T-1) 5.7.4.  Confinement  NCOs,  or  other  trained  confinement  staff,  provide  inventory  control  of prescribed  medications  and  medication  devices,  as  well  as  observe  and  document  confinee medication compliance with the label instructions. 5.7.5.  Maintain  prescribed  confinee  medications  in  a  secure  double  locked  location  (e.g., store  in  a  locked  container  inside  a  dedicated  medical  locked  cabinet).  Medications  or medication devices no longer required will be returned to the MTF for disposal. (T-1) 62 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 5.7.6.  When confinees transfer to another facility, the escorts will transport medications and medication  devices  to  the  receiving  facility  to  be  receipted  for  by  appropriate  confinement staff. (T-0) 5.7.7.  The MTF pharmacy should be consulted for appropriate packaging of medications to ensure  streamlined  inventory  control  and  limited  quantities  are  dispensed.  For  tablets  and capsules, use unit dose packaging (blister packs) whenever possible. (T-3) 5.7.8.  Controlled medications (Schedules II-V) will be maintained by the confinement staff on an AF Form 579, Controlled Substance Register. The AF Form 579 maintained at the CF will be accounted for during the monthly disinterested inventory process as outlined in AFI 41-209,  Medical  Logistics  Support.  The  pharmacy  staff  trains  confinement  staff  on  proper maintenance and documentation of the AF Form 579. Trained confinement staff will observe and  document  confinee  Controlled  Substance  (Schedule  II-V)  compliance  based  upon  the healthcare provider’s instructions. (T-0) 5.7.8.1.  NOTE:  Due  to  the  complex  inventory  requirement,  care  providers  are encouraged to consider non-Schedule medications whenever medically possible. 5.7.9.  Medication  Log.  Maintain  a  separate  log  on  each  confinee,  even  if  no  medications were issued. The log includes confinee’s name, date originally confined, date/time of issue, the  issuing  official’s  printed  name.  Additionally,  the  issuing  staff  member  annotates medication name, number of pills/dose issued, and ending count. (T-1) 5.7.10.  When  the  confinee  transfers  or  is  released,  place  completed  medication  logs  in  the CTF, or no later than time of transfer or release. (T-1) 5.7.11.  Seek healthcare  provider instructions when a  confinee is  released for disposition  of any remaining medications or medication devices (return to MTF or provide to the released person). (T-1) 5.7.12.  Over-the-counter  (OTCs)  medications  (e.g.,  Tylenol™,  aspirin,  etc.)  may  only  be administered or distributed in accordance with a health care provider’s order. (T-1) 5.8.  Hospitalized  Confinees.  The  MTF  medical  officer  on  duty  is  responsible  for  all urgent/emergency confinee medical matters. The confinement officer is responsible for custody and control matters. (T-0) 5.8.1.  The  confinement  officer  provides  the  hospital  commander  a  brief  history  of  the confinee’s conduct and custody classification. (T-1) 5.8.2.  Confinees  do  not  receive  per  diem  or  other  TDY  allowances  if/when  travel  status  is necessary  for  hospitalization.  When  projecting  for  TDY  hospitalization,  the  parent installation confinement officer: 5.8.2.1.  Informs the TDY installation DFC of the projected hospitalization. (T-1) 5.8.2.2.  Provides the necessary transfer information. (T-1) 5.8.2.3.  Establishes the confinee’s custody classification with the TDY installation DFC. (T-0) 5.8.3.  The  inmate’s  parent  unit  provides  escort  and  guard  personnel  when  required, consistent with custody classification and security requirements. (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 63 5.8.4.  Confinees who are pregnant. Confinement officers and NCOs consult with MTF staff for  the  care  and  management  of  pregnant  confinees.  Pregnancy  does  not  preclude confinement as long as appropriate prenatal care is provided and there is a medical treatment facility near the confinement facility, which can provide for labor, delivery, and management of  obstetrics.  Medical  officers  determine  the  time  when  the  prohibition  for  post  pregnancy waist/leg and behind the back hand restraints is rescinded. (T-0) 5.8.4.1.  Placing  the  newborn.  Arrangement  for  placement  for  any  child  born  while  the mother is  in  custody should  be made as soon as  possible after the pregnancy is known, but no later than the seventh month of pregnancy. It is the responsibility of the expecting mother  to  decide  on  care  arrangements  for  the  child.  Alternatives  include  placing  the child with  relatives, in  a foster home, or for adoption. Confinement personnel  assist  the expectant  mother  in  making  arrangements  to  confer  with  legal  and  family  support services.  Infants  must  be  moved  to  the  placement  location  directly  from  the  hospital.  If the mother refuses or is unable to make arrangements, the DFC coordinates with SJA and civil authorities for temporary foster care, including the Personnel Office if the child is to retain military dependent benefits without the sponsor present. The person designated to provide temporary care must come to the hospital to receive the child. (T-0) 5.8.4.1.1.  Following  an  uncomplicated  delivery,  the  normal  period  of  reduced activity is 6 weeks. The examining medical officer determines reduced activities and profile. (T-0) 5.8.4.1.2.  All  non-medical  care  expenses  involved  are  the  responsibility  of  the confinee. (T-0) 5.8.4.1.3.  If pregnancy  of a confinee presents  special or unique situations, it should be  noted  that  they  may  request  deferment  of  the  sentence  to  confinement  in accordance with RCM 1101(c). (T-0) 5.8.4.2.  Elective Abortion. A confinee considering elective abortion will be permitted to discuss the matter with medical staff and, if desired, with a chaplain or other counselor. Other  than  offering  the  services  of  a  counselor,  medical  practitioner,  mental  health practitioner,  or  a  chaplain,  facility  personnel  will  not  attempt  to  influence  a  confinee’s desires regarding abortion. (T-0) 5.8.4.2.1.  Use  of  appropriated  funds  to  perform  abortions  in  DoD  facilities  is prohibited by 10 USC §1093. There are limited exceptions, consult with appropriate legal and medical personnel for further guidance. (T-0) 5.8.4.2.2.  If a confinee desires to seek an abortion, she must submit a written request to the confinement officer. Unless the abortion meets a legal and medical exception, the  abortion  must  be  funded  by  the  confinee  and,  unless  exempted  for  a  military treatment  facility,  be  arranged  through  a  civilian  facility.  Consult  with  legal  and medical  personnel  for  current  medical  and  funding  requirements.  Maintain  custody and  control  during  pre-procedure  visits  to  the  location  where  the  abortion  is  to  be performed  and  any  subsequent  follow-up  care.  Following  an  abortion  at  a  civilian medical  facility,  the  confinee  should  be  examined  by  a  military  or  government employed  contract  physician  to  determine  additional  treatment  and  follow-up  care. (T-0) 64 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 5.8.4.2.3.  Following  an  abortion,  a  period  of  reduced  activity  is  normal.  For  an uncomplicated  abortion,  the  time  length  is  normally  about  72-hours.  The  examining medical officer will determine reduced activities and profile. (T-0) 5.8.4.2.4.  Postoperative counseling is to be made available, if desired. (T-0) 5.8.4.3.  Custody  and  control  during  pregnancy.  Pregnancy  care  (prenatal,  childbirth, miscarriage or abortion) is a sensitive medical and emotional undertaking. When deciding appropriate  custody  control  needs  at  the  hospital  take  the  entire  situation  into  account, e.g. times of medical incapacitation (which reduce harm or flight risks) and that the use of  restraints  during  childbirth  is  rarely  necessary  and  often  involves  high  medical  risk therefore,  it  should  be  considered  only  in  extreme  circumstances  under  medical  advice with  the  causality  well  documented.  Physical  control  prohibitions  during  pregnancy  or pregnancy recovery are; the use of leg restraints, waist restraints and handcuffing behind the back. Compensate for the lack of physical restraints by locally determining increased supervision during movements. (T-1) 5.9.  Public  Affairs.  Access  by  the  public  to  AFCS  facilities  is  upon  the  approval  of  the installation  commander  and  should  be  limited  to  those  in  the  community  with  legitimate correctional  concerns  (pastoral,  civil  leaders,  etc.).  Care  should  be  taken  to  avoid  criticism, defamation, embarrassment, and mental anguish to detainees/inmates confined within the facility resulting from visit and tour policies. 5.9.1.  Videotaping  and  photographing  confinees  is  not  permitted  except  in  support  of medical  documentation,  for  official  identification/investigative  purposes  (i.e.,  criminal activities, such as disturbances, forced cell moves, etc.), or IAW AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies  and  Procedures.  If  the  confinee  consents  to  a  photo/video,  other  than  for  official identification or investigative purposes, they must sign a consent statement. (T-1) 5.9.2.  Photographing  inside  an  AFCS  facility  is  not  permitted  unless  authorized  by  the confinement  officer  or  as  an  exception  to  policy  when  the  stated  purpose  justifies  such action. When photography is authorized, it will not include: (T-1) 5.9.2.1.  Scenes including confinees who are identifiable. 5.9.2.2.  Scenes depicting confinee under custodial control. 5.9.2.3.  Use of restraining devices. 5.9.2.4.  Any of the physical  plant that may show vulnerabilities (except  as For Official Use Only). 5.9.3.  All  requests for media (either on or off  base) interviews (face-to-face, on camera, or telephonic) with military detainees/inmates are not authorized unless a determination is made that  such  interview  or  communication  serves  a  legitimate  public  interest  or  is  in  the  best interest of the military. The request for interviews and communications are approved by the installation  commander.  The  PA,  DFC,  and  SJA  provide  their  installation  commander  with sufficient background information in order to make an informed decision. Interviews may not compromise the security procedures established by the confinement facility. (T-0) 5.9.4.  Written  material  prepared  by  detainees/inmates  for  publication  must  be  submitted  to the  confinement  officer  or  delegated  representative  for  review  prior  to  release.  In  addition, AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 65 such material is subject to national security and policy review by PA under the provisions of AFI 35-101. (T-1) 5.10.  Alien  Notification.  When  military  members  who  are  non-US  citizens  are  placed  into confinement upon sentencing, forward the CA’s final order (including confinement location) to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement IAW DoDI 1325.07, Chapter 2. (T-0) 5.11.  Release  From  Confinement.  Conduct  pre-release  conference  between  the  confinement staff, confinee, and parent unit. Scheduled releases from confinement are a two-step process.  It begins with a pre-release conference and ends with an actual release. 5.11.1.  The DFC coordinates release of inmates with installation commander and parent unit commander  when  inmates  complete  their  sentences  to  confinement,  or  are  approved  by  the AFC&PB for release on parole. The CA directs  inmates to  be placed on  excess  leave upon completion  of  confinement  (reference  AFI  51-201).  The  confinement  officer  or  NCO  pre-coordinates  with  base  legal  and  personnel  staffs  to  determine  any  outstanding  issues.  The confinement  officer, inmate’s  unit  commander  or  designated representative, conducts a pre-release conference with the inmate at least 3 duty days before release. Items of discussion usually include transportation and personnel processing actions. (T-1) the  presence  of in 5.11.1.1.  NOTE  1:  When the parent unit commander or designated  representatives  are geographically  separated,  the  confinement  staff  provides  them  with  a  memorandum  for record of the conference details. 5.11.1.2.  NOTE  2:  The  confinement  officer,  after  consultation  with  the  SJA,  releases pretrial detainees upon written order of an authorized official (i.e., confining official) to a representative from their parent unit. 5.11.2.  Use  DD  Form  2718  to  authorize  release  from  post-trial  confinement.  If  there  is  a valid  legal  detainer  from  a  civilian  jurisdiction,  notify  the  jurisdiction  of  the  release date/time.  If  there  is  no  valid  legal  detainer,  the  inmates  are  offered,  if  appropriate, transportation off base to the servicing civilian airport, bus terminal, or train station. If a non-military  affiliated  person  will  pick  them  up  by  car,  deliver  the  inmate  to  the  base  Visitor Reception  Center,  or  locally  determined  suitable  (near  the  gate)  off  base  location.  The inmates are released on their own recognizance. (T-1) 5.11.3.  The parent unit is responsible for submitting the proper documentation, i.e., AF Form 2098,  to  FSO  to  place  member  on  excess  leave.  Timely  coordination  between  the confinement  facility,  unit  commander,  SJA,  and  the  FSO  is  necessary  to  ensure  prompt release from confinement and proper entitlement (if any) of military pay and allowances. Be aware  that  the  court  may  have  ordered  pay  for  family  members  (often  if  they  were  the victims of the adjudged sponsor/member). (T-1) 5.11.3.1.  NOTE:  As appropriate, ensure the SJA initiates the application for transitional compensation and provides it to the FSS for processing. 5.11.4.  Confinees  approved  for  release  on  parole/MSR  are  reassigned  to  an  AFSFC/SFC PAS  Code.  The  permanent  duty  station  is  designated  by  AFSFC/SFC.  If  an  inmate  is approved for parole/MSR while confined in an AF Level I facility, coordinate the release to community supervision with AFSFC/SFC. (T-1) 66 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 5.11.5.  A discharge or dismissal will not be executed until appellate review is completed and discharge  or  dismissal  has  been  ordered  executed  (Final  Order).  Those  awaiting  appellate review  of  an  unsuspended  punitive  discharge,  which  have  already  completed  their confinement,  may  be  involuntarily  placed  on  excess  leave  by  direction  of  the  CA  IAW Article 76a, UCMJ and AFI 51-201. (T-0) 5.11.5.1.  NOTE:  When  legal  reviews  are  completed,  AF  Form  100,  Request  and Authorization  for  Separation,  and  DD  Form  214,  Certificate  of  Release  or  Discharge from Active Duty, are executed and copies furnished to the member. 5.11.6.  When released on parole/MSR before the Final Order for discharge or dismissal. The Unit  First  Sergeant,  or  designee,  ensures  leave,  pending  completion  of  appellate  review  is processed.  The  inmate's  unit  also  ensures  inmates/dependents  are  issued  armed  forces identification card(s) with an expiration date of 300 days from date of release. Confinement NCOs ensure DD Form 2717, Department of Defense Voluntary/Involuntary Appellate Leave Action,  or  comparable  document  is  prepared  prior  to  confinement  release  date.  Military benefits associated with appellate leave cease when the Service Discharge is executed. (This does not mean discharge from confinement. Contact AFSFC/SFC for additional information, if needed.) (T-0) 5.11.6.1.  Excess  Leave  Actions  when  released  without  parole/MSR  before  the  Final Order  for  discharge  or  dismissal.

As a minimum, the following guidelines apply: 6.1.1.  H&C items for post-trial inmates in non-pay status (pretrial detainees are normally in a pay status) are issued according to facility guidelines and may be procured in several ways. Items are purchased using parent unit O&M funds, or the confinement officer establishes an issue  stock  of  items,  purchased  through  installation  O&M  funds.  (See  Attachment  3  for listing  of  H&C  items.)  As  a  minimum,  provide  items  for  personal  hygiene.  The  guidance found  in  AFI  36-2903,  Dress  and  Personal  Appearance  of  Air  Force  Personnel,  applies  to confinees as well.) Additional guidance is found in DoDI 1325.07. (T-0) 6.1.2.  Transfer  confinees  with  their  H&C  items  by  agreement  with  the  gaining  facility, which should include amounts deemed adequate for a 7-day period. (T-1) 6.1.3.  Maintain  an  emergency  stock  of  issue  H&C  items.  Suggest  asking  local  Medical  or Services units if they have any expendables (soap, shampoo, razors, etc.) that could be given to confinement NCO to maintain for emergency issue. (T-3) 6.2.  Correspondence  and  Visitation  .  DFC  may  limit  correspondence  and  visiting  privileges for  a  confinee  based  upon  the  protection  of  public  safety,  an  institution’s  schedule,  space, institutional order and security, or under advice of care providers as part of a medical or mental health treatment plan. NOTE: See DoDI 1325.07 for additional information. (T-0) 6.2.1.  Correspondence and visits with family members should normally be approved unless the security needs of the facility, the treatment program of the confinee, or the circumstances of  the  offense  committed  warrant  limitations  or  disapproval,  i.e.  contact  with  victims  or witnesses. (T-0) 6.2.1.1.  For  the  protection,  health,  safety,  and  welfare  of  the  victims  and  witnesses, correspondence  and  visits  with  victims  or  witnesses  will  ordinarily  not  be  permitted.  If the victim or witness is an immediate family member, the correspondence or visit may be approved  in  advance  by  the  DFC  upon  consultation  with  SJA  or  AFSFC/SFC.  Victims and witnesses include, but are not limited to, those persons listed on the DD Form 2704 or  named  in  any  specification  which  resulted  in  a  finding  of  guilty  and  has  not  been discussed  upon  appellate  review.  A  confinee  may  not  request  or  cause  a  third  party  to contact a victim or witness without the advance approval of the DFC. (T-0) 6.2.1.2.  Correspondence  with  a  confinee  in  another  correctional  facility  will  not  be permitted unless such individual is an immediate family member and the correspondence is approved in advance by the DFC and the military commander or warden of the other facility. (T-0) 6.2.1.3.  Confinees  are  not  permitted  to  conduct  a  business  while  incarcerated,  but  may initiate correspondence necessary to protect their legitimate personal property and funds held  at  time  of  incarceration.  This  doesn’t  apply  to  those  seeking  employment  upon sentence completion or for parole plan submission. (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 69 6.2.1.4.  Document disapprovals of correspondence and visitor requests as permanent part of CTF. (T-0) 6.2.2.  Correspondence by mail refers to use of US Postal Service or Official Military Mail. Outgoing  mail  should  have  no  markings  in  the  return  address,  which  indicate  the  sender’s confinement  status,  past  or  present.  Confinement  NCOs  determine  the  template  for  return addresses (T-2)  Confinee  use  of  electronic correspondence (e.g., e-mail, cell phone, etc.) is not authorized. (T-0) installation  procedures. IAW local 6.2.2.1.  Non-privileged  mail  (incoming  and  outgoing)  may  be  opened  to  ensure  that money, stamps, personal property, and valuables are brought under the control of the CF and  that  the  confinee  does  not  receive/distribute  contraband.  The  confinement  officer limits  the  scope  of  the  inspection  of  correspondence  to  that  reasonably  necessary  to control property, prevent receipt of contraband, and otherwise provide for the safety and security of the facility and the community. (T-0) 6.2.2.2.  Privileged mail (incoming) may be opened only in the presence of the confinee. Military or civilian attorneys of  record must mark “Privileged Mail” on the front  of the envelope for it to be considered privileged mail. If privileged mail is opened, it is only to ensure it does not contain contraband and a cursory visual scan that it appears to be legal documents/communications. (T-0) 6.2.2.3.  Do  not  place  restrictions  on  the  number  of  letters  to  and  from  authorized correspondents,  except  as  necessary  to  maintain  security  and  control,  or  to  prevent unreasonable  or  excessive  individual  use  of  outgoing  mail  privileges.  Restrictions  or limitations on correspondence privileges must be approved by the DFC and stated in the Facility Rules Book. (T-0) 6.2.2.4.  Forward confinee letters containing accusations, charges, or complaints through proper channels to the official who has the authority to correct the complaint or alleged wrong.  Forward  petitions  or  writs  for  release  to  the  proper  authority  (consult  with  the SJA). (T-0) 6.2.2.5.  Confinees  may  receive  non-privileged  packages  and  articles  other  than correspondence,  under  reasonable  terms,  conditions,  and  limitations  approved  by  the DFC. This local policy must be clearly stated in the Facility Rules Book. Packages must be fully inspected and may not contain dangerous objects (DFC determines on a case by case basis), or food, liquid, medicines, electronics, stamps, monies, or other negotiables. Books  and  magazines  titles  must  be  approved  (no  pornographic  or  inflammatory material)  by  the  DFC  in  advance  and  those  approved  publications  must  arrive  directly from the publisher. (T-0) 6.2.2.6.  Confinees  are  provided  reasonable  postage  as  an  H&C  item,  as  per  DoDI 1325.07.  Postage  for  those  in  a  non-pay  status  may  be  purchased  from  appropriated funds.  Those  in  a  non-pay  status  may  also  be  provided  paper/envelopes  for  personal outgoing  mail.  Those  in  a  pay  status  may  purchase  their  own  postage  using  personal funds.  Ensure  stamps  do  not  become  a  negotiable  currency  among  the  confinees  by accounting  for  number  of  stamps  purchased  and  used.  Use  DD  Form  499,  Prisoner’s Mail  and  Correspondence  Record,  to  account  for  postage  and  control  authorized correspondence. (T-0) 70 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 6.2.2.7.  Material  is  prohibited  which  violates  US  Postal Service  regulations  or  contains pornography,  obscenity,  blackmail,  contraband,  or  threats.  (Obscenity  is  defined  as writings  or  pictures/drawings,  that  taken  as  a  whole  under  contemporary  community standards,  are  offensive  because  they  depict  sexual  conduct  in  a  patently  offensive  way and taken as a whole lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.) Material advocating  criminal  activities,  violence,  racial,  or  ethnic  unrest  is  also  prohibited. Additionally,  mail  is  prohibited  which  contain  the  following:  material  pertaining  to gambling  or  lotteries,  codes,  or  plans  for  activities  in  violation  of  CF  rules  or  the  law; solicitations for gifts or money; solicitations for pen pals; or any other materials that fail to conform with these guidelines or those of the US Postal Service. (T-0) 6.2.2.8.  Only correspondence (incoming and outgoing) written in English is authorized, unless  otherwise  verified  that  the  confinee  is  unable  or  that  the  addressee  would  be unable to understand English. In these instances, obtain a fluent interpreter to screen or as a  minimum  consider  the  criminal  sophistication  of  the  confinee  and  the  relationship  of the  correspondent  when  deciding  whether  foreign  language  correspondence  should  be permitted. Consult with the SJA as necessary. (T-3) 6.2.3.  Confinees are allowed reasonable opportunities to make telephone calls at no expense to the Government. DFC may limit number/length of telephone calls made by confinees and approve  telephone  use  schedules.  Calls  may  be  monitored.  Calls  may  be  recorded  upon consultation  with  SJA.  NOTE:  Correspondence  by  telephone  means  a  hard  wired commercial or government instrument. (T-0) 6.2.3.1.  Notice must be provided to confinees that calls are subject to monitoring and/or recording. (T-0) 6.2.3.1.1.  NOTE:  Best practice is to place notice both near or on the instrument and in the Facility Rules Book. 6.2.3.2.  Best practice method for staff and confinee is for confinee to purchase a “1-800” calling  card  commercially  available  at  the  Base  Exchanges.  Or,  the  confinee  may  in-process with a calling card from a vendor of their choice or a card may be provided to the confinee  from  family  or  friend  via  the  parent  unit.  The  staff  stores  calling  cards  IAW local procedures to prevent it from becoming a negotiable currency among the confinees. (T-2) 6.2.3.3.  CFs  provide  a  telephone  that  is  not  monitored  for  calls  made  to  attorneys  of record  or  clergyman.  Calls  to  non-government  attorneys  or  non-government  clergyman are to be at no expense to the government. (T-0) 6.2.3.4.  Allow  only  incoming  calls  from  attorneys  of  record,  commander,  or  first sergeant.  In  addition,  allow  confinees  to  receive  emergency  telephone  calls  (after verification),  through  the  confinement  staff,  if  a  death  or  serious  illness  occurs  in  the confinee’s immediate family. Offer and provide access for assistance to contact Chaplain or qualified/privileged Mental Health provider, if requested. (T-0) 6.2.4.  Visitation. Document visits to maintain a record of visitors, times/dates, and confinee visited. Access by the public to AFCS facilities is limited to authorized tours and visits. Care should  be  taken  to  avoid  criticism  or  embarrassment  of  the  confinees.  NOTE:  Use  locally AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 71 devised  visitor  log  (hardcopy  or  computerized).  Determine  files  management  actions  and timelines necessary to maintain for possible future Law Enforcement use. (T-0) 6.2.4.1.  Confinement  officer  establishes  the  visiting  schedule  and  ensures  visits  are supervised. (T-1) 6.2.4.2.  Normally,  visitor  searches  are  limited  to  checks  of  their  person  with  a  metal detection  device  and  physical  checks  of  handbags  and  parcels,  before  entering  the facility. The DFC or designated representative (E-7 or above) has discretion to discretely request  physical  frisk  searches  of  visitors  when  deemed  appropriate.  In  the  SF  and/or Confinement  Blotters  log  the  reason/result  of  the  frisk  search  with  the  names  of  the visitor and the same gender searcher. (T-1) 6.2.4.3.  Secure  all  visitors'  hand  carried  items  during  a  visit  IAW  local  procedures. Ideally, the storage area should have lockers with individual keys that the visitor can keep during the period of visit. (T-2) 6.2.4.4.  The confinement officer or NCO determines if a confinee is authorized a contact or non-contact visitation. Non-contact visitation may be authorized in those instances of substantiated risks. Contact visitation is limited to a short embrace at the beginning and at the termination of the visit. (T-1) 6.2.4.5.  Official  Visits.  Parent  unit  commanders  or  their  appointees  in  the  grade  of  E-7/GS-9  or  above  may  visit  confinees  at  any  time.  There  are  no  restrictions  on  official visits  as  long  as  they  do  not  interrupt  normal  facility  operations.  If  possible,  provide separate  visiting  areas  for  privileged  communication  visits  (attorneys,  chaplains,  etc.). Maximum and medium custody confinee visits take place in a secure area within the CF. Visits  with  minimum  custody  confinees  may  take  place  outside  the  facility  (i.e.,  in  the recreation yard or an adjacent picnic area) but only under supervision. (T-1) 6.2.4.6.  Authorized  Visits.  Normally  visitation  is  on  weekend  and  Federal  holiday afternoons.  However,  the  confinement  officer  may  grant  exceptions  to  permit  a  visit during  weekdays.  For  instance,  when  a  visitor  travels  a  long  distance,  or  when  such  a visit appears advisable for other reasons. The maximum number of visitors per confinee is four persons per visit. (T-1) 6.2.4.6.1.  NOTE:  Best practice indicates that 1300-1500 is the most opportune time for visits as it has the least impact on facility schedules for meals, house cleaning, etc. 6.2.4.7.  Inspect visiting rooms/areas for contraband before and after each visiting period. Conduct  a  frisk  search  of  confinees  before  and  after  visits.  These  searches  should  take place out of sight of visitors. (T-1) 6.2.4.8.  Post  flyers  visible  to  facility  visitors  on  “how  third  parties  can  report”  sexual abuse  or  sexual  harassment  on  behalf  of  a  confinee.  List  numbers/names  of  such organizations, e.g., DoD Safe Line, SAPRO or any other beneficial information. (T-0) 6.3.  Support  Services.  Confinees  receive  services  from  base  support  agencies  in  much  the same  manner  as  active  duty  military.  Custody  classification  or  local  requirements  determine level or extent of service. (T-0) 72 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 6.3.1.  Confinees  receive  the  same  medical,  dental,  and  mental  health  care  as  active  duty persons, to include emergency services. Care also includes substance abuse/drug and alcohol education. (T-0) 6.3.2.  SJA  provides  legal  assistance  to  confinees  on  personal  civil  legal  matters  IAW  AFI 51-504, Legal Assistance, Notary, and Preventive Law Programs. Confinees seeking advice on  criminal  matters  should  consult  the  area  defense  counsel  or  their  appellate  defense counsel. (T-0) 6.3.3.  Religious  and  spiritual  activities  should  be  designed  to  accommodate  a  variety  of religions  IAW  DoDI  1300.17,  Accommodation  of  Religious  Practices  Within  the  Military Services.  Authorized  religious  activities  in  the  CF  include  worship  services,  sacramental ministry,  pastoral  counseling,  religious  education,  spiritual  growth,  prayer,  and  meditation. Confinees  should  be  afforded  opportunities  to  participate  in  religious  activities,  consistent with  available  resources  and  the  need  to  maintain  good  order  and  discipline.  However, confinees are not required to attend religious meetings or services. For the safety and security of confinees and staff, religious practices that include alcoholic or controlled substances are prohibited. (T-0) 6.3.3.1.  Subject  to  their  particular  assigned  custody  and  control  requirements,  provided resources  are  available,  confinees  may  attend  services  at  the  installation  chapel. Confinees may be permitted to  wear  a non-utility  service uniform to  attend. Parent  unit personnel may be used to support this activity. (T-2) 6.3.3.2.  While conducting in-processing or cell searches, treat  religious  items  with  care and respect. The installation staff chaplain appoints a chaplain staff representative as the facility POC. (T-1) 6.3.4.  Confinees receive the same food service available to active duty personnel on a meal card. (T-2) 6.3.4.1.  Confinees in segregation receive meals in their quarters. (T-1) 6.3.4.2.

The confinement officer or NCO ensures availability of washers and dryers. Confinees in a non-pay status are provided laundry cleaning materials using O&M funds. (T-0) 6.3.6.  The  confinement  officer/NCO  arranges  barber  and  beautician  service,  to  maintain confinee hair standards per AFI 36-2903, with the Base Exchange or other contract service. Confinees in a pay status pay for this service. Use O&M funds to pay for services received by those in a non-pay status. (T-0) 6.3.7.  Tobacco  Use.  CFs  are  tobacco-free.  Make  tobacco  cessation  treatment  available  to confinees who use tobacco. Reference AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air Force. (T-1) 6.3.8.  Confinee  Finances.  The  FSO  maintains  pay  records  unless  otherwise  directed  by AFSFC/SFC. When confinees go on excess leave, AFSFC/SFC becomes their FSO. (T-1) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 73 6.3.9.  Confinee  Marriages.  If  a  marriage  is  sought,  advise  the  confinee  of  the  associated requirements while confined e.g., no family attendance, no reception, no conjugal visit, etc. For further guidance, see Attachment 10. (T-1) 6.4.  Complaints.  Complaints fall into one of three categories: Confinement Complaints, Chain-of-Command Complaints, and Inspector General (IG) Complaints. CFs should ensure complaint procedures are stated in the Facility Rules Book. (T-0) 6.4.1.  Confinement complaints. Confinees who have general complaints against confinement operations,  procedures,  or  against  a  staff  member,  use  the  complaint  system  of  the  facility housing  them.  Initiate  the  complaint  process  by  submitting  the  DD  510  to  the  confinement NCO,  or  other  designated  representative.  The  confinement  NCO  will  in  turn  provide  the complaint  to  the  appropriate  person/office,  track  response  for  the  DFC,  and  provide  the response  to  the  complainant.  If  the  complaint  is  against  the  confinement  officer,  NCO,  or DFC, the confinee may use any available communication, i.e., inform their ADC, their parent unit leadership during a command visit, or use the IG system. (T-0) 6.4.2.  Chain-of-command  complaints.  Confinees  who  have  a  parent  unit/host  installation complaint submit a DD Form 510, through the confinement NCO, who in turn provides it to the parent unit First Sgt/Commander for action. (T-0) 6.4.3.  Inspector General Complaints. Confinees  of any Service housed in  an AFCS facility may  submit  complaints  using  the  AF  complaint  system.  Procedures  are  based  upon  the confinement location. (T-0) 6.4.4.  Confinees  housed  in  other  service  CFs  may  file  complaints  about  facility  operations through that facility’s/Service’s complaint system. (T-0) 6.4.4.1.  NOTE  : Confinees at AFSFC/Corrections Detachments or Operating Locations may  provide  a  copy  of  the  complaint  to  AFSFC/SFC,  1517  Billy  Mitchell  Blvd,  JBSA Lackland TX 78236-0119, for AF situational awareness to the problem. 74 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 Chapter 7 VICTIM WITNESS, SEX OFFENDER, AND DNA REQUIREMENTS 7.1.  Victim/Witness  Assistance  Program.  The  AF  Victim  and  Witness  Assistance  Program (VWAP) is implemented by the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, the Crime Victims’ Rights  Act  (18  USC  §3771),  DoDD  1030.1,  Victim  and  Witness  Assistance,  and  DoDI  1030.2, Victim and Witness Assistance Procedures, and is prescribed by AFI 51-201 and this instruction. AFI 51-201, designates the AF Security Forces Center, AF Corrections Division, as the AF CR for the VWAP. (T-0) 7.1.1.  Local Responsible Official (LRO). AFI 51-201 identifies the LRO as the installation commander who is responsible for identifying victims and witnesses of crimes and providing VWAP  services. This  function is  then normally delegated to  the SJA who selects  a  VWAP coordinator to manage the program and be responsible for training. The VWAP coordinator may also serve as a victim liaison. Liaisons are appointed by the LRO or delegate, to assist a victim during the military justice process. (T-0) 7.1.2.  For  all  courts-martial  resulting  in  confinement,  even  without  a  Victim  or  Witness identified  or  whether  victims/witnesses  elect  not  to  receive  notifications,  the  responsible government  Trial  Counsel  or  Designee  (TC/D)  completes  DD  Form  2704,  Victim/Witness Certification  and  Election  Concerning  Prisoner  Status,  and  provides  a  copy  to  the  local confinement  facility.  The  TC/D  informs  victims  and  witnesses,  if  any,  of  their  right  to notifications.  The  victim  or  witness  makes  their  “election  preference”  by  initialing  the  DD Form 2704, on whether they elect or do not elect to receive notifications. (T-0) 7.1.2.1.  The  TC/D  provides  a  copy  of  the  DD  Form  2704  to  the  Manager,  AF  Central Repository at, AFSFC/SFCV, 1517 Billy Mitchell Blvd, JBSA Lackland TX 78236-0119 or via encrypted email to: afsfc.sfcv@us.af.mil. (T-0) 7.1.2.2.  It  is  the  victims’  and  witnesses’  responsibility  to  notify  the  AF  CR  of  any changes  in  their  address  or  telephone  number  once  the  TC/D  completes  the  DD  Form 2704. When a change request is received, the AF CR will in turn provide the change to the CF and originating SJA. (T-0) 7.1.2.2.1.  NOTE:  It  is  often easier for the victim/witness to  contact  the originating SJA  (a  person  or  office  with  whom  they  are  familiar)  to  assist  them  in  preparing requests to update contact information or to change their original notification election decision which will then be forwarded to the AF CR. 7.1.3.  Establishing  the  Program.  Every  SF  unit  located  on  an  installation  that  conducts courts-martial,  with  or  without  a  confinement  facility,  establishes  a  Victim/Witness Assistance  Program  (VWAP).  This  provides  continuity  for  VWAP  notification  processes, even when the military member is confined in a civilian facility for the military. All inmates (who receive a sentence to confinement) have a DD Form 2704 in order to determine victim or  witness  notification  requirements.  Facilities  follow  up  with  the  SJA  until  the  form  is obtained. For those who elect to participate, the confinement officer ensures procedures are established  to  protect  the  rights  of  victims  and  witnesses.  These  procedures  apply  to  other Service  confinees  who  are  confined  in  an  AF  facility.  NOTE:  For  the  purposes  of  this AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 75 instruction,  the  facility  VWAP  monitor  is  also  the  Sex  Offender  Notification  Program monitor. (T-0) 7.1.3.1.  The  confinement  officer  appoints  the  VWAP  monitor  in  writing  (normally,  the facility confinement NCO). The facility VWAP monitor must understand the importance of  this  program  and  be  sensitive  to  the  needs  of  the  victims/witnesses  (i.e.,  treat  with compassion). (T-0) 7.1.3.2.  Victim’s Rights. The VWAP monitor must be aware of, and accord, the victim’s Art  6b,  UCMJ,  rights.  These  rights  include:  NOTE:  Consult  with  the  SJA  if  any questions. 7.1.3.2.1.  To be “reasonably protected” from the accused. (T-0) 7.1.3.2.2.  To  notice  of  confinement  hearings,  court-martial  proceedings,  public proceedings  of  the  clemency  and  parole  board,  and  the  release  or  escape  of  the accused. (T-0) 7.1.3.2.3.  To  be  present  at  such  hearings  unless  the  judge  or  investigating  officer determines  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  the  victim’s  testimony  would  be materially altered by hearing other testimony. (T-0) 7.1.3.2.4.  To  be  reasonably  heard  at  confinement  hearings,  sentencing  hearings  and the clemency and parole board. (T-0) 7.1.3.2.5.  To  be  reasonably  able  to  confer  with  government  counsel  in  these proceedings. (T-0) 7.1.3.2.6.  To restitution. (T-0) 7.1.3.2.7.  To proceedings free from unreasonable delay. (T-0) 7.1.3.2.8.  To  be  treated  with  fairness  and  with  respect  for  the  victim’s  dignity  and privacy. (T-0) 7.1.3.3.  VWAP  monitors  victim/witness  information  with  strict  confidentiality.  The identity (i.e., contact information) of a crime victim/witness will not be disclosed to the inmate  or  any  unauthorized  third  party,  as  determined  by  the  confinement  officer  and VWAP monitor. All requests for notification from victims/witnesses remain confidential. The  VWAP  monitor  is  the  principal  facility  point  of  contact  to  report  any  complaint  of inmate  harassment  or  threat  toward  a  victim/witness.  The  VWAP  monitor  reports  all complaints  to  the  confinement  officer  for  further  investigation  and  possible  disciplinary action. In virtually all reported cases of contact, the commander of the inmate orders the inmate  to  cease  communications  with  the  victim  or  witness.  The  confinement  officer establishes  internal  controls  to  keep  information  submitted  by  victims  and  witnesses confidential and prevents unauthorized access to associated files. These procedures apply to inmates of other Services confined in an AFCS facility. (T-0) 7.1.3.3.1.  VWAP Training. Unit confinement staff receives periodic training, at least annually, on VWAP and confinement staff responsibilities. Contact the DFC and the VWAP  Local  Responsible  Official  (LRO)  at  the  legal  office  for  development  and accomplishment of the training. (T-0) 76 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 7.1.4.  Victim/Witness  Protection.  Any  time  a  victim/witness  is  believed  to  be  in  danger, render  all  assistance  possible  (within  jurisdictional  limits)  to  get  protection  for  them. Assistance may range from advising the victim/witness to contact local law enforcement, to the  confinement  officer  or  designee  personally  advising  law  enforcement  agencies  about danger in the victim’s/witness’ jurisdiction. Military authorities should handle protection for victims/witnesses  within  military  jurisdiction.  Notify  AF  Office  of  Special  Investigations (AFOSI) in  cases involving AF inmates. Advise  inmates they are not to  make contact  with any victim/witness of their confining offense either directly or through a third party without the  permission  of  the  victim/witness.  This  prohibition  includes  contact  via  telephone  calls, visits, written letters, or e-mail. Inmates desiring to communicate with a victim/witness may submit  a  request  to  the  confinement  officer.  The  VWAP  monitor  communicates  with  the victim/witness to determine whether contact is desired. This requirement applies to all cases regardless of whether the victim/witness has elected to participate in this program. (T-0) 7.1.5.  Post-trial  VWAP  Notification  Procedures.  When  a  victim  or  witness  has  requested notification  of  changes  in  confinee  status  on  the  DD  Form  2704,  the  VWAP  monitor completes  a  DD  Form  2705,  Victim/Witness  Notification  of  Prisoner  Status,  to  notify  the victim  or  witness,  IAW  the  below  status  change  notification,  Not  To  Exceed  (NTE)  the timeframe  in  Table  7.1.  Also  complete  the  appropriate  notification  cover  letter  on  unit letterhead  (See  Attachments  12,  13,  and  14)  and  attach  the  DD  Form  2705.  Make notifications  in  the  prescribed  timeframe  or  as  soon  as  possible  upon  receipt  of  outside agency notifications which have exceeded the NTE timeframe. Annotate all notifications on the Victim/Witness Notification Record (Attachment 14), or similar document and file by the accused’s last name, with all other VWAP documents. Send all correspondence by certified mail,  Return  Receipt  Requested  (RRR).  Attach  all  certified  registered  return  receipts  to  the facility copy of the DD Form 2705 and place in the facility VWAP monitors adjunct VWAP file. (T-0) Table 7.1.  Notification Procedures.

Attach a completed DD  Form  2705  to  the  initial  enrollment  letter.  Additionally,  provide  the  victims  and witnesses of the initial Clemency and Parole, Parole Eligibility dates, if applicable. (T-0) 7.1.5.2.  Notice  of  Clemency/Parole  Hearing.  Notify  victims/witnesses  IAW  Table  7.1. (see  Attachment  12)  held  by  the  appropriate  Military  Service  C&PB.  Advise victims/witnesses  of  their  right  to  make  a  personal  appearance  at  their  expense  at  the AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 77 clemency/parole  hearing  and  of  their  right  to  submit  statements  to  the  Service  C&PB regarding the impact the crime has had on their lives. (T-0) 7.1.5.2.1.  The  date  an  inmate  is  eligible  for  an  AFC&PB  hearing  is  based  upon guidance in  DoDI 1325.07. The guarantee of a hearing  does not  guarantee a release decision. The notification of a pending hearing date allows the victim or witness with an  opportunity,  if  so  desired,  to  present  material  for  consideration  by  the  board. Victims  are  also  entitled  to  provide  input  to  the  facility’s  disposition  board  (a  local board conducted in order to provide the AFC&PB with sufficient detail on behavior, rehabilitation, etc., and provide a recommendation).

When charges are withdrawn (post-trial) and there are victim/witness  notifications where the withdrawn charges results in  no confinement, or  the  remaining  charge(s)  do  not  have  victims/witnesses  associated,  make  a  final notification  of  release.  If  the  charges  are  pending  for  a  rehearing,  make  appropriate notifications upon the result of the hearing. (T-0) 7.1.5.4.2.  Pretrial Detainees. If a military magistrate determines a detainee should be released  from  pre-trial  confinement,  the  VWAP  monitor  immediately  notifies  the victim(s). The VWAP monitor also confers with the SJA to determine if notification of any witnesses would be prudent as a courtesy. (T-0) 7.1.5.4.2.1.  NOTE  :  Do  not  delay  contacting  victims  or  witnesses.  Seek assistance from appropriate law enforcement agency investigators or from SJA’s VWAP coordinator or Trial Counsels as they have usually established a working relationship with the victims and or witnesses. 7.1.5.5.  Escape  (and  subsequent  return  to  custody).  Notify  victims  and  witnesses  by telephone  as  soon  as  possible  (NTE  24-hours)  after  discovery  of  an  escape  by  an adjudged  inmate.  Victims  and  witnesses  will  be  re-notified  by  telephone  upon  the inmate’s  return  to  confinement.  Provide  this  information  to  the  AF  CR,  by  the  most expeditious  means  (e-mail  or  telephone).  The  telephone  notification  is  followed  up  in writing via DD Form 2705 and Attachment 13. (T-0) 7.1.5.5.1.  NOTE:  See paragraph 8.8 for additional information on escapees. 7.1.5.6.

Verify  authenticity, if  questioned,  contact  AFSFC/SFC.  Complete notifications  via  DD  Form  2705  and  Attachment  13.  For  EP,  Victims/witnesses  are normally notified by telephone due to a lack of time prior to release which is followed up in writing via DD Form 2705 and Attachment 13. (T-0) 7.1.5.6.1.  NOTE:  For additional EP requirements, see paragraph 12.23. 7.1.5.7.  Death. Notify the victim or witness within 10 days of the death of an inmate via DD Form 2705 and Attachment 13. (T-0) 7.1.6.  Monthly  Reports.  Each  installation  housing  confinees  in  their  facility  or  housing confinees in a civilian facility off-base for the government on a Confinement Order, submits an  AF  Form  4289,  Monthly  Confinement  Report  and  Victim/Witness  Activity  Concerning Inmate  Status,  to  AFSFC/SFC  by  the  fifth  of  the  following  month.  NOTE:  Reports  are AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 79 required whether or not anyone was confined for the report month. If no one was confined, a letter format in lieu of the form is acceptable. Each report is completed by the confinement NCO/POC and approved by the confinement officer’s name and  signature. Reports are sent digitally signed/encrypted via email  to:  afsfc.sfcv@us.af.mil or faxed to Commercial (210) 925-5411 or DSN 945-5411. (T-0) 7.1.6.1.  This  activity  report  collects  pertinent  confinement  data  which  AFSFC  uses  to complete  DD  Form  2720,  Annual  Confinement  Report,  and  DD  Form  2706,  Annual Report on Victim and Witness Assistance for HQ AFLOA, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness), and the Department of Justice (DoJ). (T-0) 7.1.6.2.  Complete  AF  Form  4289  by  listing  all  confinees  housed  via  a  DD  Form  2707 (on-base and/or off-base) during report period in  Columns I-VIII (for pretrial  detainees, annotate  the  pretrial  start  date  in  Column  VIII).  Inmates  with  VWAP  notification requirements will be identified by completing Columns VIII-XII. Indicate the number of days  the  confinee  was  confined  in  Column  VI  by  using  the  appropriate  on-base  and/or off-base  block  for  the  report  month.  If  both  locations  are  used,  annotate  the  inclusive dates  at  each  location  in  the  remarks  section  after  the  inmate’s  name.  If  the  pretrial detainee is adjudged, add the individual on additional row and complete two rows for the confinee  based  upon  both  pre  and  post-trial  status.  If  the  inmate  has  sex  offender notification  requirements,  annotate  accordingly.  Entries  pertaining  to  the  number  of victims are annotated in the (V) column, witnesses in the (W) column for the following: number  informed  of  rights  (i.e.,  the  total  number  on  the  DD  Form  2704  by  V/  W category),  number  elected  notification  (i.e., indicated  “yes”  by victim/witness).  Based  upon  sentence  length  and  required  notifications,  during  months notifications  were  made,  also  indicate  the  status  change  (reason  code).  The  form  self calculates  the  total  number  notified  (DD  Forms  2705  sent)  based  upon  the  number  of status  changes  and  the  number  of  victims/witnesses.  Annotate  the  numeric  code  to indicate how the notification was made. Use the number 1 for telephone or 2 for written) followed by the reason code(s) for the inmate status change(s). Report each inmate who does not have a DD Form 2704 on file each month. (T-0) total  number 7.1.7.  Victim  or  Witness  (V/W)  Change  Request.  If  the  facility  VWAP  monitor  receives updated contact information (address/phone number/email) directly from a victim or witness who was enrolled in the notification program, forward the information to the AF CR. Within five working days of receiving the request, the AF CR processes the updated information and ensures  the  CF  housing  the  inmate  obtains  the  updated  contact  information.  When  the concerned  inmate  is  assigned  to  another  branch  of  service,  the  AF  CR  forwards  to  the appropriate Service CR. Refer victims/witnesses who have case questions concerning matters other  than  CF  VWAP  notifications  to  the  appropriate  legal  office.  NOTE:  If  the  facility receives  a  request  directly  from  an  individual  identifying  themselves  as  a  crime  victim  or witness  who  wasn’t  enrolled  in  the  VWAP  notification  program  by  trial  counsel  (via  DD Form 2704), refer the individual to the appropriate legal office (i.e., responsible for the court-martial of the accused) to determine if the individual is to be added to the DD Form 2704. If that  option  isn’t  available  (i.e.,  legal  office  no  longer  exists),  the  VWAP  monitor  should contact the AF CR for assistance. (T-0) 7.1.7.1.  There are two types of disenrollment of requests, V/W disenrollment request and facility disenrollment request. 80 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 7.1.7.1.1.  Victim/ Witness  Disenrollment  Request.  A victim or witness may  request disenrollment  from  the  VWAP  notification  program  by  writing  the  confinement facility  where  the  inmate  is  housed  or  to  the  inmate’s  Service  CR.  Forward  all disenrollment  requests  made  directly  to  the  confinement  facility  to  the  AF  CR. Should inmates be assigned to another branch of service, the AF CR forwards to the appropriate Service CR. (T-0) 7.1.7.1.2.  Facility  Disenrollment  Request.  Prior  to  requesting  V/W  disenrollment, ensure at  least  three failed attempts to  contact,  at  least  once by Certified Mail if the address  is  CONUS,  are  documented,  prior  to  the  VWAP  monitor  requesting disenrollment. Further, if the VWAP monitor’s mail or telephonic attempts to contact a  V/W  are  unsuccessful,  contact  the  SJA  for  additional  assistance.  If  all  attempts  to locate are still unsuccessful, the VWAP monitor provides a MFR (no specific format) to the AF CR, including all actions taken to locate the victim or witness, and request disenrollment  from  the  VWAP  notification  program.  For  inmates  assigned  to  other branches of service, the AF CR forwards requests to the appropriate Service CR and provides  the  forwarding  facility  confirmation  of  receipt  of  the  request.  V/W’s removed due to this request are placed in inactive status. (T-0) 7.1.7.2.  Central Repository. The AF CR approves/disapproves all disenrollment requests for  victim(s)/witness(es)  of  AF  courts-martialed  inmates  within  five  working  days  of receiving the request. The CR processes the updated information and ensures the VWAP monitor  at  the  CF  housing  the  inmate  obtains  the  updated  contact  information.  The VWAP  monitor  updates  the  CFs  file  copy  of  the  DD  Form  2704  based  on  the  CR memorandum by removing their names from active VWAP participation and placing the names in inactive status. (T-0) 7.1.8.  VWAP Files Management. 7.1.8.1.  Correctional  Treatment  Files  (CTFs).  Annotate  inmate  CTFs  which  include victims or witnesses with notification requirements for VWAP program identification on the folder jackets for easy identification. (T-1) 7.1.8.1.1.  NOTE:  For "VICTIM/WITNESS  NOTIFICATION(S) REQUIRED"  or  “VW”  in  one-inch  high  labels  and  highlight  the  file  ID  label  to immediately identify inmates with participants. example: 7.1.8.2.  VWAP  Notification  Record.  The  VWAP  Monitor  maintains  a  separate  adjunct file. File under the inmate’s last name, by calendar year. Each file contains the following documents when notifications are required: DD Form 2704, DD Form 2705, cover letters, and  victim/witness  notification  logs.  Document  all  contacts  with  a  victim  or  witness  on the DD Form 2705. Annotate the date, time, method of contact (phone, mail, e-mail, or in person), telephone number/address used, staff name, and reasons/outcome. Do not allow the inmate access to VWAP information. (T-0) 7.1.8.3.  PA and  FOIA Requests.  If a Privacy Act of 1974 or a Freedom  of  Information Act (FOIA) request is received then refer to the System of Records Notice (F 031 AF SF A) to determine any exemptions under 5 USC §552a (j)(2) and (DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302). (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 81 7.1.8.4.  Disposition  of VWAP  Notification  Records.  VWAP  monitors  add  VWAP  files to their file maintenance and disposition plans. Establish facility VWAP files or binders and  mark  “DO  NOT  RELEASE  TO  INMATE”  and  “Exempt  from  Freedom  of Information  Act  and  Privacy  Act  Release”.  Maintain  these  records  on  all  inmates assigned  IAW  AF  Records  Disposition  Schedule  (RDS)  located  in  AF  Records Information Management System (AFRIMS), Table 31-2, Correction Records. (T-0) 7.1.8.5.  Staging of files. After release from sentence, seal VWAP files and all associated documents  (e.g.,  VWAP  notification  logs,  etc.)  in  a  separate  manila  envelope.  Identify files as “inactive” with US vs. name of the accused. Clearly label the envelopes, “Exempt from Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Release”. (T-0) 7.1.9.  Reporting  Requirements.  The  AF  CR  tracks  statistics  reported  by  each  installation (i.e.,  AF  Form  4289)  to  consolidate  and  submit  DD  Form  2706,  Annual  Report  on  Victim and  Witness  Assistance  (items  4  &  5),  to  AFLOA/JAJM  who  in-turn  submits  to  the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Attention Legal Policy Office. The data is reported  by  15  Feb  for  the  preceding  calendar  year  quantifying  the  assistance  provided  to victims and witnesses of crime. (T-0) 7.2.  Crimes  Against  Children  and  Sexually  Violent  Offender  Registration  under  Federal Law. 7.2.1.  General Provision. If the member has been convicted of a sexually violent offense or certain  offenses  against  a  minor,  the  AF  is  required  to  provide  notice  to  federal,  state,  and local  officials  prior  to  the  offender’s  release  from  confinement,  and  the  member  may  be required  to  register  as  sex  offender  under  individual  state  laws.  See  the  Jacob  Wetterling Crimes  Against  Children  and  Sexually  Violent  Offender  Registration  Act  (1994);  Megan’s Law  (1996);  the  Final  Guidelines  for  the  Jacob  Wetterling  Crimes  Against  Children  and Sexually  Violent  Offender  Registration  Act;  Pam  Lyncher  Sex  Offender  Tracking  and Identification Act (1996); Jacob Wetterling Improvements Act (1997); Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act (1998); and Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (2006). The  Acts  are  available  at  the  United  States  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  website http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/smart/legislation.htm. (T-0) 7.2.2.  Compliance  with  Federal/State  Laws.  The  confinement  officer  ensures  compliance with federal/state laws by notifying the appropriate law enforcement and sex offender (SO) registration officials using DD Form 2791, Notice of Release/Acknowledgement of Convicted Sex  Offender  Registration  Requirements.  Additionally,  the  confinement  officer  obtains  the offender’s written acknowledgement of these registration responsibilities. (T-0) 7.2.2.1.  NOTE:  See Attachment 15 for sample template. 7.2.3.  Sex  Offender  Registration  and  Notification  Act  (SORNA).  Pursuant  to  42  USC §16901, et.  al.,  the confinement staff notifies appropriate federal  and state authorities of all cases  involving  the  release  (from  the  military  or  from  confinement)  of  court-martialed military members convicted of sexually violent offenses and/or sex offenses against victims who were minors (persons under the age of 16 years). (T-0) 7.2.4.  Responsibilities.  With  SJA  assistance,  the  confinement  NCO  screens  for  prior  SO criteria  offenses  (civilian  or  military)  via  applicable  files  or  sources,  i.e.,  Computerized 82 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 Criminal  History  (CCH).  Inquire  with  AFLOA  to  screen  the  AMJMS  database  for  prior military CMO with SO conviction(s). (T-0) 7.2.4.1.  Should  a  previous  SO  conviction  be  found  in  the  data  base  search,  locate  the appropriate  civilian  or  military  SO  registration  form(s)  and  provide  notice  of  this subsequent  SO  conviction  to  the  agencies  involved  in  previous  conviction(s)  (i.e.,  DD Form  2791  or  civ  equivalent).  OCONUS  installations  should  coordinate  with  AFSFC when  they  lack  NCIC/NLETS  capability  for  further  instructions  on  completing  an NCIC/NLETS query. (T-0) 7.2.4.2.  If a previous SO conviction is located on the accused, search the individual’s SO history  for  any  for  previous  VWAP  data.  Obtain  the  names  and  contact  information  of victims  and/or  witnesses  via  appropriate  agency  (i.e.,  the  jurisdiction  VWAP  form)  to contact  the  previous  victims/witnesses  of  the  re-confinement  via  DD  Form  2705  (if applicable).  If the member was  convicted in  the  military, contact  the CR for assistance. (T-0) 7.2.5.  Before  releasing  a  member  convicted  of  an  offense  requiring  SO  processing  (IAW DoDI  1325.07,  Appendix  4  of  Enclosure  2),  at  a  general  or  special  court-martial,  the  DFC provides  written  notice  of  the  sex  offender  release  (registration/notification)  to  the  LE agencies  listed  in  paragraph  7.2.7.4.  Additionally,  it  should  be  noted  SO  registration requirements  vary  by  state  and  may  be  triggered  by  offenses  not  listed  in  DoDI  1325.07. Therefore,  a  member  convicted  of  an  offense  that  does  or  does  not  trigger  sex  offender notification  requirement  may  nonetheless  be  required  or  not  required  to  register  as  a  sex offender under that states law. When in doubt if a particular offense must be reported, consult the installation SJA. (T-0) 7.2.6.  The  confinement  NCO  notifies  the  following  four  agencies:  the  State  Attorney General,  Local  Law  Enforcement,  the  State  Sex  Offender  Registration  Official  where  the offender intends to reside, and the USMS National Sex Offender Targeting Center (NSOTC). To  accomplish  notification  and  follow  up,  the  confinement  NCO  establishes  a  password-protected account by emailing the DoJ SORNA Exchange Portal at AWA-Request@iir.com using  your  confinement  organizational  email  account  address.  Once  the  account  is established it is used to conduct registration and gather information. See paragraphs 7.2.7.4.1. –  7.2.7.4.4.  for  additional  information.  Each  facility  ensures  notifications  are  completed  as required by this instruction, DoD guidance, and Federal Statutes. Attach a copy of Report of Result of Trial, to the DD Form 2791, prior to sending to the four agencies. (T-0) 7.2.6.1.  Convictions  without  confinement.  When  a  member  is  convicted  of  an  offense that triggers the sex offender registration requirements and confinement  was not  part of the  adjudged  punishment  (or  sufficient  pretrial  or  illegal  pretrial  confinement  credit completely  offsets  the  term  of  confinement  imposed  at  trial),  the  SJA  notifies  the confinement officer in writing within 24-hours of the conviction. Upon notification of the conviction  by  SJA,  the  corrections  officer  (or  if  designated,  the  VWAP/SOR  Monitor) notifies  the  four  agencies  immediately  (see  paragraph  7.2.7.4.  for  additional  agency information), not to exceed 24-hours as outlined below. (T-0) 7.2.7.  Procedure.  In  cases  where  notification  is  required,  the  confinement  staff  at  the offender’s  confined  location  (regardless  of  the  offender’s  branch  of  Service)  does  the following: AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 83 7.2.7.1.  Inform  the  offender  prior  to  final  release  they  are  subject  to  a  registration requirement as a sex offender in any state in which they reside, are employed, carry on a vocation, or are a student. (T-0) 7.2.7.2.  Use  DD  Form  2791,  to  obtain  offender’s  written  acknowledgment  of  the foregoing notification. Also obtain from offender and include on the form their intended residing  address  upon  release  from  confinement  or  upon  completion  of  a  court-martial resulting in  a conviction  of a triggering offense.  A confinement staff member witnesses offender’s signature. If offender refuses to sign, contact the SJA for assistance, but  as a minimum complete a MFR outlining refusal and attach to DD Form 2791. (T-0) 7.2.7.2.1.  Inmates convicted of sex offenses must be notified of available community treatment  programs  prior  to  release.  Inmates  are  to  be  provided  information  on community  treatment  programs  available  in  the  community  in  which  they  intend  to reside.  This  requirement  applies  whether  or  not  the  inmate  participated  in  sex offender  programs  while  incarcerated.  Releasing  inmates  convicted  of  sex  offenses poses a unique risk to the community at large. This is one reason why extensive sex offender  treatment  programs  have  been  instituted  at  Level  II  and  III  correctional facilities. This notification is intended to supplement these programs and ensure that all inmates convicted of sex offenses are aware of local treatment opportunities before release, whether they  were adjudged or sentenced for sex offense(s)  against  either a minor or an adult. (T-0) 7.2.7.2.1.1.  NOTE:  Inmates  transferred  to  another  correctional  facility  or released  to  a  detainer  do  not  need  to  be  provided  this  information  at  the  losing confinement/corrections location. 7.2.7.2.2.  Prior  to  release,  the  confinement  NCO  ensures  all  qualifying  inmates receive  the  Notification  of  Community  Treatment  Programs  (see  Attachment  16). Include  the  name,  address,  and  telephone  number  of  the  treatment  agency.  Other information  may  include  the  length  and  cost  of  treatment,  as  well  as  the  modality used. A minimum of one treatment source should be provided. A copy of the form is to  be  filed  in  the  inmate’s  CTF.  If  released  on  parole,  a  copy  is  forwarded  to  the parole officer. (T-0) 7.2.7.2.2.1.  z  NOTE:  To  determine  available  resources  there  are  two  points  of contact; the confinement NCO can, 1) email the Association for the Treatment of Sexual  Abusers  at,  http://www.atsa.com/request-referral  or,  2)  contact  the office  of  AFSFC  Det  2,  AF  Corrections,  Chief,  Clinical  Services,  at  DSN  267-7155. 7.2.7.3.  Registration. No later than 2 weeks prior to the offender’s final release date from confinement  (in  order  to  ensure  receipt  at  least  5  days  prior  to  the  offender’s  release date),  complete  and  send  separately  addressed  copies  of  DD  Form  2791  and  a  copy  of their  Report  of  Result  of  Trial  or  CMO,  via  certified  mail,  return  receipt  requested  (or when possible via encrypted email with read receipt). Suspense the return receipt request (PS  Form  3811)  for  14  days  CONUS  or  30  days  for  OCONUS  to  ensure  notification. Once  the  receipt  is  returned,  attach  it  to  the  DD  Form  2791  and  place  it  in  the  facility adjunct file. Ensure all return receipts are returned. Document unreturned receipts, follow up  and  make  reasonable  attempts  to  locate  the  unreturned  receipt.  Contact  AFSFC/SFC 84 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 for further instructions if all attempts fail. The military notifies the below agencies of the offender’s  sexual  offense  via  DD  Form  2791,  specifically  identifying/explaining  the convicted article(s) and attaching their Report of Result of Trial or CMO in order for the gaining  jurisdiction  to  determine  registration  requirements  due  to  the  nature  and circumstances surrounding the crime(s) committed. (T-0) 7.2.7.3.1.  State  law  enforcement.  Notify  the  State’s  law  enforcement  agency  where offender plans to reside. This is the usually the State/Territory Attorney General, use the  DoJ  National  Sex  Offender  Public  Website:  www.nsopw.gov  to  obtain  the mailing address for the specific state law enforcement. (T-0) 7.2.7.3.2.  Local  Law  Enforcement.  Notify  the  local  law  enforcement  agency  where the  offender  plans  to  reside.  Typically  this  is  the  offices  of  either  the  municipality chief of police or the county sheriff where the offender plans to reside. If assistance in identifying  the  appropriate  agency  is  required  in  situations  involving  multiple jurisdictions  with  overlapping  authority,  use  the  DoJ  National  Sex  Offender  Public Website:  www.nsopw.gov  to  obtain  the  mailing  address  for  the  specific  local  law enforcement.

Contact  AFSFC/SFC  if  a phone number is needed. (T-0) 7.2.7.3.5.  Service Record. The VWAP/SOR monitor provides AFSFC/SFCV the four agency  copies  of  DD  Form  2791  and  receipt  confirmation  (e.g.,  CM/RRR)  of  the local LE agency notification for convicted SO (any branch of Service) released to the community (with or without confinement). Send copies by either US Mail (1517 Billy Mitchell  Blvd,  JBSA  Lackland  TX  78236-0119),  or  via  e-mail  (digitally signed/encrypted) to  afsfc.sfcv@us.af.mil  for their placement in  the SO’s branch of service  permanent  Service  record.  For  AF  members,  the  they  are  placed  in  the Automated  Records  Management  System  (ARMS)  maintained  by  AFPC.  Contact AFSFC/SFC for assistance with unusual situations or circumstances of convicted sex offenders. (T-0) 7.2.7.3.6.  Correctional  Treatment  File.  Once  the  VWAP/SOR  receives  each  of  the four  LE  Agency  receipt  confirmations,  file  one  copy  of  each  in  the  sex  offender’s CTF.  If  the  SO  was  not  confined,  place  a  copy  in  the  facility  sex  offender  file  and provide the local LE agency copy to the offender. (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 85 7.2.7.3.7.  Paroled Sex Offenders. In cases where inmate is to be released on parole, provide  the  supervising  US  Probation  Officer  (USPO)  a  copy  of  inmate’s  (SO’s) written acknowledgment and copies of DD Forms 2791. (T-0) 7.2.7.3.8.  When  CAs  suspend  a  sentence  to  confinement  adjudged  by  court-martial but  the  sex  offense  guilty  finding  remains,  then  the  member’s  release  from confinement  triggers  the  above-described  notice  requirements  and  the  confinement officer  complies  with  procedures  detailed  in  paragraph  7.2.1.,  as  applicable.  In  the event  the CA’s suspension is  subsequently vacated and member is  required to  serve their sentence to confinement, the notification requirements are to be re-accomplished before inmate is again released from confinement. (T-0) 7.2.7.3.9.  If a subsequent court on appeal removes the guilty finding(s) for triggering sex  offense(s)  then  the  original  military  law  enforcement  jurisdiction  removes (expunges)  all  the  agency  notifications,  DNA  collections  and  other  appropriate registration actions in regard to sex offense criminal history. (T-0) 7.2.7.3.9.1.  NOTE:  Seek additional guidance from the SJA and AFSFC/SFC for removal procedures. 7.2.8.  Adam  Walsh  Act  Protection  and  Safety  Act  of  2006.  For  staff  information  this  act modified  covered  jurisdictions,  established  uniform  and  comprehensive  sex  offender registration  and  notification  requirements,  established  new  programs  designed  to  combat crimes  against  children,  expanded  sex  offender  registries,  ensures  sex  offenders  are  held accountable  for  their  crimes,  prevents  child  pornography,  makes  the  internet  safer  for children  through  authorizing  Project  Safe  Childhood,  and  established  42  USC  §16945  Sex Offender  Sentencing  Monitoring,  Apprehending,  Registering,  and  Tracking  (SMART) Office. SORNA administers national standards for sex offender registration and notification, which  provides  technical  assistance  for  sex  offender  registration  and  notification  measures for the protection of the public from sexual abuse or exploitation. 7.2.8.1.  Include  sex  offender  requirements  in  facility  operating  instructions  and  self-inspection checklists. Inspect each facility sex offender registration/notification program as  a  minimum,  every  3  years.  This  can  be  accomplished  during  MAJCOM/IG  or  Staff Assistance  Visits  using  AFSFC/SFC  provided  criteria.  Inspections  include,  as  a minimum, identification of all sex offenders convicted of a criteria sex offense during the past 12 months. Conduct a review of the sex offender notification files to verify each PS Form 3811, Domestic Return Receipt, was received (i.e., stapled to or filed with the DD Form 2705) or verify the DD Form 2705 was suspensed for 14 days CONUS or 30 days for  OCONUS  to  ensure  the  notification  (DD  Form  2791,  Notice  of  Release/ Acknowledgement of Convicted Sex Offender Registration Requirements) is received by each agency. (T-0) 7.2.8.2.  To  comply  with  Registered  Sex  Offender  (RSO)  requirements  the  confinement officer  may  delegate  the  above  victim/witness  and  sex  offender  release  notification responsibilities to a subordinate officer or noncommissioned officer. 7.2.8.3.  Convictions  by  Host  Country.  Service  members,  military  dependents,  DoD Contractors,  and  DoD  Civilians  can  be  convicted  of  a  sex  offense  outside  normal channels  by  the  host  nation  while  assigned  overseas.  When  compliance  with  these  sex 86 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 offender provisions is required by the aforementioned individuals, the SJA will notify the appropriate  individuals  in  order  for  the  DD  Form  2791  (or  equivalent  document)  upon release from the host nation. Provide the DD Form 2791 and supporting court decisional documents to federal, state, and local law enforcement as directed. (T-0) 7.3.  Compliance with Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Collection under Federal Law. 7.3.1.  General  Provision.  DNA  collection  is  required  when:  a  person  subject  to  the  UCMJ has been apprehended  for an  offense  which makes DNA collection mandatory;  fingerprints are  taken  in  conjunction  with  an  investigation  for  offenses  listed  in  DoDI  5505.11, Fingerprint  Card  and  Final  Disposition  Report  Submission  Requirements,  after  completion of  the  72-hours  commander’s  memorandum  approving  continued  pretrial  confinement;  and upon  an  accused’s  entry  into  confinement  as  a  result  of  a  general  or  special  court-martial conviction. It also requires collection where an investigator concludes there is probable cause that  the  subject  committed  the  offense  (such  as  a  confinee  violating  the  UCMJ  while confined),  and  when  charges  are  preferred  IAW  DoDI  5505.14,  Deoxyribonucleic  Acid (DNA) Collection Requirements for Criminal Investigations.

(T-0) 7.3.1.2.  Conviction.  If  an  accused  is  convicted  of  any  offense  at  a  general  or  special court-martial  and  the  Report  of  Result  of  Trial  document  indicates  “DNA  Processing Required” in the Sentence block, ensure collection. Annotate promulgating orders (Court-Martial  Orders)  in  boldface  type  on  the  first  page,  “DNA  Processing  Required  10  USC §1565 and 42 USC §14135(a)”. (T-0) 7.3.2.  Confinement  Procedure.  Depending  on  the  nature  of  the  charges,  DNA  could  have been  collected  during  the  investigation  by  the  investigative  agency  (reference  DNA collection in AFI 51-201). If the court-martial order requires DNA collection, determine first if the responsible investigative agency collected and submitted the DNA to USACIL. Consult with the SJA if questions. (T-0) 7.3.2.1.  If  DNA  wasn’t  collected  or  isn’t  able  to  be  verified,  the  confinement  staff complies with collection requirements if SF Investigations was responsible for the case. If  AFOSI  was  responsible,  make  contact  asking  AFOSI  to  accomplish  collection, complete  a  MFR  and  place  in  the  CTF.  Follow  up  to  ensure  submission  was  made  to USACIL.

Minimum of two SF 88 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 escorts with one armed 8.1.1.  Confinee  “counts”  verify  the  population.  As  a  minimum,  conduct  confinee  counts  at shift change, during sleeping hours (irregular checks), during work hours, or when confinees are  away  from  the  facility  (by  radio,  telephone,  or  in  person)  to  ensure  accountability  on  a 24-hour basis. (T-0) 8.1.2.  Normally, do not wake confinees to accomplish counts during sleeping hours, except during emergencies such as fire or immediate counts due to an escape. (T-0) 8.1.3.  Post-trial  Custody  Reclassification  (Adjustments).  Custody  classification  up-grades immediately  for  safety  or  cause.  Use  DD  Form  2711-1,  Custody can  be  done Reclassification,  to  document  the  reasons  and  place  completed  form  and  other  relevant information in the CTF. After a period of observation, generally 2 weeks to ensure behavior modification, the Confinement Officer may recommend a custody classification down-grade to  the  DFC.  Base  down-grade  decisions  on  completion  of  the  DD  Form  2711-1  and  place completed  form  and  other  relevant  information  in  the  CTF.  For  post-trial  inmates  in maximum  custody,  reconsider  at  a  minimum  of  every  2  weeks  if  a  maximum  custody classification is still necessary by using the DD Form 2711-1 and place completed form and other relevant information in the CTF. NOTE: Refer to Chapter 5 for initial classifications.  (T-0) 8.1.3.1.  Table 8.2. illustrates behavior characteristics typical of post-trial reclassification considerations.  Use  this  table  to  assist  in  documenting  administrative  factors  from  DD Form 2711-1, block 4. This list is not all inclusive and is meant as a guideline. Table 8.2.  Post-Trial Reclassification Considerations.  MAXIMUM  Conduct indicates intention/ Risk of Escape high probability of escape exists, history of escape, or escape attempts. Specialized training (e.g., Escape & Evasion skills). MEDIUM Conduct indicates probability of escape exists. Violence Recent or historical demonstration of violence or threats. Active member of gang/group advocating violence or recent assault on staff. Limited history of violent behavior involving weapons but not recent. MINIMUM  No history of escape or attempts. No history of violent behavior or threats. Mental/Emotional Highly unpredictable, history of serious mental instability, or extremely violent outbursts. Recent suicide gestures or attempts. Stable personality, minor emotional disorders. Past history of suicide gestures or attempts but not recent. Stable personality and no record of suicide gesture or attempts. 8.2.  Escort  Planning  for  Installation/Local  Area  Movements. The confinement officer/staff ensures  compliance  with  prescribed  security  requirements  based  upon  custody  classification. When transporting confinees, the vehicle driver is not counted as an escort. Escorts and drivers AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 89 may be either military or DoD civilians. Ensure non-SF staff escorts are trained IAW paragraph 8.3. and document training. (T-0) 8.2.1.  When  confinees  are  removed  from  the  facility  for  appointments,  etc.,  use  SF  and confinement blotter entries to  record time, date, location(s), and  escort/driver names. When using  non-SF  staff  for  escorting,  use  DD  Form  2708  to  document  proper  chain  of  custody. Confinement  staff  briefs  Non-SF  escorts  on  Use  of  Force  and  Rules  of  Engagement. Document in the SF and confinement blotters. (T-0) 8.2.2.  When  escorting  multiple  confinees  with  mixed  custody  classifications,  follow  escort procedures  for  the  highest  classification.  When  using  non-SF  staff  for  escorting,  use  DD Form 2708 to document proper chain of custody. (T-0) 8.3.  Escort  Requirements for Installation/Local Area Escort Movements. SF and parent unit personnel must be careful not to assign escort duty to any person who may sympathize with the confinee (i.e., a friend/neighbor or previous co-worker, etc.). The Confinement Officer or NCO determines appropriate escort ranks for the mission;  however, as a minimum,  when parent  unit personnel  are  used,  the  escort(s)  must  be  at  least  an  E-5  (or  GS  equivalent).  NOTE:  Rank restrictions  do  not  apply  to  SF  personnel  conducting  local  area  movements  (escorts)  or  while supervising confinees. Document escort training for all non-SF staff and file in the Confinement NCOs office. Trainer/trainee sign/date and list training items; maintain memo(s), as needed. If an incident  occurs,  it  must  be  shown  that  the  escort  was  fully  trained  and  aware  of  the  mission actions/requirements. (T-1) 8.3.1.  Maximum Custody. Each will be escorted with two personnel, one of which must be an armed SF member. Use approved restraining devices, e.g., handcuffs, Hoffman Cuffs™, belly chain/belt, and leg irons as appropriate. (T-1) 8.3.2.  Medium Custody. When escorted by parent unit personnel, the ratio is one escort per confinee. When escorted by SF, the ratio is one per two confinees. Use approved restraining devices, e.g., handcuffs, Hoffman Cuffs™, belly chain/belt, and leg irons as appropriate. (T-1) 8.3.3.  Minimum Custody. When escorted by parent unit personnel, the ratio is one escort per four confinees. When escorted by SF, the ratio is one per eight confinees. Local procedures must be established for escorts of these inmates while away from the facility. Inmates in this custody  classification  may  be  signed  out  for  work  details.  Escorts  should  consider  carrying handcuffs in case use is necessary. (T-1) 8.3.4.  Movement  Requirements.  Confinees  are  escorted  at  all  times  when  away  from  the facility.  Escorts  maintain  positive  control  over  the  confinee  and  their  movements/actions. Confinement  staff  provides  training  to  parent  unit  escorts  on  security  requirements.  This training must be thorough as the greatest escape opportunity exists while a confinee is away from  the  facility.  (T-1)  An  assigned  trainer  should  emphasize  the  following  escort responsibilities as a minimum: 8.3.4.1.  Responsibilities for the safety and welfare of the confinee and the public. (T-1) 8.3.4.2.  The  custody  classifications  (related  requirements)  and  any  special  instructions such as controlling and administering prescribed medication. (T-1) 90 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 8.3.4.3.  Detailed instructions for unplanned or emergency situations such as unexpected delays during transfer, escape, or attempted escape and medical emergencies. (T-1) 8.3.4.4.  How and when to use restraint device(s). (T-1) 8.3.4.5.  Reporting  instructions  (including  required  documents,  i.e.,  chain-of-custody receipts) at the final destination (if any). (T-1) 8.3.4.6.  Disposition of the confinee’s property (in cases involving transfers). (T-2) 8.3.4.7.  For  installation/local  escort  missions  the  DFC  determines  when  it  may  be situationally appropriate for escorts, whom are military, to wear civilian clothes vice the uniform of the day. 8.3.5.  Escorts  should  never  allow  a  confinee  to  leave  their  control  before  properly relinquishing control to  competent authority such as the confinee’s attorney or confinement staff. (T-0) 8.3.5.1.  One means of maintaining constant control is with restraining devices. 8.3.5.2.  Confinement  officers  determine  devices  required  while  confinee  is  away  from the facility (locally). 8.3.6.  Confinement  staff  trains  escorts  on  proper  use  of  restraining  devices  and  escape prevention  measures.  Escorts  should  never  allow  confinees  to  lag  behind  or  leave  the immediate area of the escort. This situation gives an advantage to the confinee if escape is on their  mind.  Visual  contact,  coupled  with  the  ability  to  achieve  immediate  physical  contact, will deter most escape attempts. (T-1) 8.3.6.1.  Escorts are trained to a minimum standard set by the confinement officer. (T-1) At a minimum, the following training will be covered: 8.3.6.1.1.  Custody Classifications; (T-1) 8.3.6.1.2.  Handcuffing and Searching Techniques; (T-1) 8.3.6.1.3.  Restraint Devices; (T-1) 8.3.6.1.4.  Blood Borne Pathogens; (T-1) 8.3.6.1.5.  DD Form 2708; (T-1) 8.3.6.1.6.  Detainee/Inmate Custody and Control; (T-1) 8.3.6.1.7.  Use of Force Training; (T-1) 8.3.6.1.8.  First Aid/CPR certified; (T-1) 8.3.6.1.9.  Emergency  procedures  including;  health/injury,  escape  (attempted  or successful),  stops  (authorized  and  unauthorized),  and  proper  safety  for  weather conditions. (T-1) 8.3.7.  Unless  it  degrades  security,  unrestrained  confinees  are  not  denied  the  privilege  of rendering a proper military hand salute when appropriate. (T-3) 8.4.  Contraband Control.  Local operating instructions specify what items confinees can have in their possession. Anything else, or any amounts in excess of what is prescribed, is considered contraband.  The  confinement  staff  prohibits  items  which  threaten  the  safety  or  security  of  the AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 91 facility,  staff,  and  confinee  population,  or  are  prohibited  by  law  or  directives.  List  acceptable items in the Facility Rules Book. Control contraband through close supervision and unannounced searches. (T-0) 8.4.1.  Confinees  are  prohibited  from  connecting  to  the  internet  and  possessing  mobile phones. Nor may they possess devices that can connect to the internet. All communication to others  outside  the  facility  is  in  person  (official  visits  or  monitored  visitation),  hard  wire telephone (monitored/recorded if not privileged communication), or written (subject to staff review if not privileged communication). (T-0) 8.4.1.1.  NOTE:  Confinees  may  use  standalone  computers  to  compile  parole  packages, resumes  for  employment,  etc.;  however,  since  all  material  written  is  on  a  government computer there is no expectation of privacy. 8.5.  Confinee  Body  Searches.  Staff  members  do  not  conduct  opposite  gender  frisk  or  strip searches  on  confinees  except  in  exigent  circumstances.  Opposite  gender  searches  must  be properly  documented  (see  paragraph  3.3.).  Use  military  trained  search  techniques.  NOTE: Recommend  using  puncture  resistant  latex  protective  gloves  during  searches  of  persons  and clothing to protect against bodily fluid pathogens. Follow the basic rules below: (T-0) 8.5.1.  Conduct  frisk  searches  for  contraband  or  weapons  anytime  the  confinee  leaves  or returns  to  the  facility,  before  and  after  visitations,  and  as  determined  by  the  confinement officer or NCO. (T-1) 8.5.1.1.  NOTE:  It  is  a  best  practice  to  have  a  second  observer  for  any  frisk  or  strip search whether routine or exigent, if possible. 8.5.2.  Conduct complete searches as part of confinement in-processing and as determined by the confinement officer or NCO. This search involves removing and checking all jewelry and clothing from the confinee, combing out hair, checking underarms, between fingers and toes, and foot soles. Check under any bandages or tape unless removal could inflict further injury. While same gender confinement staff may visually check body openings and orifices, they do not use any type of probe or other device to check these areas. With the exception of a visual only inspection of an open mouth, only medical practitioner may physically examine interior body openings. If the searcher has suspicions, direct the unclothed confinee to momentarily squat  –  this  action  usually  causes  anything  hidden  in  the  genital  area  or  butt  crack  to  be visible. The person placing the confinee into confinement (usually, an escort, first sergeant, or commander) should remain at the facility at least until the search is complete. This allows the  confinement  staff  to  return  any  contraband  for  disposition.  Following  the  initial confinement  search,  have  the  confinee  shower  and  then  issue  clean,  previously  searched clothing. (T-0) 8.5.3.  Conduct  random  searches  of  cells/bays  and  areas  of  the  facility.  Remove  confinees from  view  of  the  cell/bay  area  to  be  searched.  Search  all  interior  and  exterior  areas  of  the facility. Search interior areas for contraband at irregular intervals. The amount of contraband found  during  these  searches  largely  determines  the  frequency  of  such  searches.  Large amounts  of  contraband  should  result  in  more  frequent  searches.  Search  all  visiting  areas before and after visitation. Search doorways, recreation areas, and outside areas at irregular intervals. Handle property carefully and document it. (T-1) 92 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 8.6.  Emergency  Plans.  Confinement  officers  and  NCOs  ensure  emergency  plans  for  their facility are prepared and tested. Specific actions are dependent upon local conditions and nature of  the  emergency.  As  a  minimum,  plans  include:  emergency  evacuations  (fire/structural damage),  response  to  disturbances  and  disorders,  hostage  situations,  bomb  threats,  natural disasters, medical emergency response, power failures, apprehension of escapees, and forced cell moves/extractions.  Plans  must  focus  on  control  and  safety  of  confinees/staff  and  include primary/alternate assembly locations. Coordinate plans with appropriate installation agencies, as required,  and  tailor  to  local  needs.  (T-1)  Additionally,  the  confinement  officer  or  NCO  is responsible to: 8.6.1.  Post evacuation routes in the facility. Ensure supporting checklists, evacuation maps, special  instructions,  and  other  appropriate  documentation  are  available  at  the  facility,  law enforcement desk, BDOC, or other posted locations as appropriate/determined by Installation Safety Office. (T-1) 8.6.2.  Train  personnel  assigned  to  the  facility  or  responsible  for  the  confinee  population  in implementing  the  emergency  plans.  Test  and  document  emergency  plans  as  determined locally. (T-1) to  situations  requiring individual 8.6.3.  Develop  plans  to  establish,  train,  equip,  and  supervise  a  forced  cell  move  team  to respond team employment may include refusal  to  enter/exit a cell or other location or  any  other situation requiring  use  of  physical  force  to  subdue  or  move  a  confinee.  Do  not  confuse  forced  cell move situations with multiple confinee unrest situations. Forced Cell Move lesson plans are available  from  the  AFSFC  website  or  AFSFC/Det  1  AF  Liaison,  US  Disciplinary  Barracks (USDB), 1301 N. Warehouse Rd, Ft Leavenworth KS 66027-2304. (T-1) interventions.  Situations  requiring 8.7.  Weapons and Other Means of Force.  Confinement staff members must use the minimum force necessary to control an individual or situation. In addition to AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, other requirements may apply to use of force; consult with unit training  section.  Whenever  possible,  videotape  all  actions  involving  use  of  force  within  the confinement  environment.  The  recording  could  protect  both  the  staff  and  the  confinees  should the  need  arise,  secure/store  as  appropriate  if  recording  is  needed  for  evidence,  otherwise  copy over  or  destroy.  NOTE:  Do  not  allow  routine  use  of  law  enforcement  body  cameras  in  the facility.  If  available,  use  during  a  disturbance  or  a  forced  cell  move,  etc.,  as  this  will  aid  in documenting staff actions. (T-1) 8.7.1.  Armed  escort  for  supervision  of  medium  or  minimum  custody  is  usually  not necessary.  However,  if  the  escort’s/supervisor’s  duty  routinely  requires  a  weapon  (i.e.,  law enforcement desk sergeant or a law enforcement patrol), there is no need to dis-arm for short or routine escorts. (T-2) 8.7.2.  Never routinely carry weapons or non-lethal devices e.g., firearm, club/baton, Ortho-Chlorobenzylidene Malonitrile (CS) gas, Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) pepper spray, or electro muscular  incapacitation  device  such  as  a  TASER  X26  ™,  etc.,  into  the  CF  except  in emergency situations, as directed by the DFC. (T-0) 8.7.3.  Use  decisive  action  to  quell  disturbances.  Chemical  irritants  or  high-pressure  water may be used in extreme situations, but only under the order of the DFC or higher authority. For example, if CS gas is the preferred method, ensure there is an adequate number of trained AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 93 personnel  and  a  supply  of  CS  gas  and  gas  masks  are  available.  (T-1)  Minimum  force methods include: 8.7.3.1.  Unarmed  Restraint  Techniques.  Unarmed  restraint  techniques  are  effective  for self-defense, to prevent escape, to prevent injury, prevent damage to property, or to quell a disturbance. To control or move uncooperative confinees, get help from confinement or other SF staff to preclude the need to strike or inflict bodily injury. (T-1) 8.7.3.2.  Non-lethal equipment/methods and additional personnel. A show of force (staff and  equipment)  demonstrates  the  means  to  which  the  authorities  will  resort  to get/maintain control. Only demonstrate what you are willing to use. If the disturbance has not reached the state of overt violence (lives and facility security are not in danger), the DFC  or  designee  should  consider  making  an  attempt  to  reason  (not  negotiate)  with leaders  of  the  disturbance  prior  to  further  application  of  force.  (T-1)  To  quell  the disturbance consider: 8.7.3.2.1.  Informing  leaders  of  the  disturbance  that  forces,  equipment,  and  facilities are available to  reestablish control and continuing the disorder would be futile. This action is not the same as bargaining or making concessions. (T-1) 8.7.3.2.2.  Issuing  an  order  to  personnel  engaged  in  the  disturbance  to  end  their actions (this is more effective if the force is present when the order is issued). (T-1) 8.7.3.2.3.  When  instructions  are  not  met  with  compliance,  immediately  apply incrementally  stronger  measures  of  force  to  contain  the  situation.  Do  not  bluff. Showing  you  mean  what  you  say  usually  prevents  the  need  to  continue  escalation, thus keeping the force necessary to the minimum. (T-1) 8.7.3.2.4.  Employing civil disturbance control formations. The DFC may direct using civil disturbance control teams and tactics. In order to quell a disturbance and restore peaceful  operations,  ensure  SF  personnel  are  proficient  in  these  tactics  and formations. (T-1) 8.7.3.2.5.  The DFC may authorize the use of military working dogs (MWDs) as part of a show of force team to augment facility control measures during disorders. First, if  methods  for  regaining/establishing  control  included  use  of  CS  gas  or  OC  pepper spray  consider  the  remnant  after  effects  of  the  chemicals  on  an  unprotected  canine before the in-facility use of a MWD team. When using MWD(s) for control,  ensure the  canine  remains  on  a  short  lease  (unleased  MWDs  could  be lured  into  a  cell  and locked by confinees during  a disturbance). The  DFC may also  authorize MWDs for routine facility searches for contraband. (T-1) 8.7.4.  Firearms.  DFCs  may  approve  using  firearms  only  when  all  other  means  of  restoring order  have  failed.  ONLY  THE  GRAVEST  AND  MOST  UNUSUAL  SITUATION REQUIRES  THE  USE  OF  FIREPOWER.  (T-0)  For  the  safety  of  staff  members  and confinees, the following rules apply: 8.7.4.1.  Armed  escorts  for  maximum  custody  confinees  should  carry  a  weapon  best suited to the existing conditions. In selecting type of weapon, consider confinee’s attitude and  conduct,  training  of  the  supervisors,  population  density  of  the  area,  proximity  of explosives  or  flammable  materials,  numbers  of  supervisors  available,  the  skills  of  the 94 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 confinee  (Survival,  Evasion,  Resistance,  and  Escape  (SERE),  Special  Forces,  Para-Rescue, Ranger, SEAL, etc.) and any other pertinent local factors. (T-1) 8.7.4.2.  Hospitalized  maximum  custody  confinee  should  be  in  a  secure  ward  when available.  When  secure  wards  are  not  available,  coordinate  with  local  law  enforcement for assistance. AF guards/escorts in hospitals carry handguns, unless expressly prohibited by  local  law,  or  as  determined  by  the  DFC,  depending  on  confinee’s  condition  after hospital admittance. Contact AFSFC/SFC for guidance. (T-1) 8.7.4.3.  The use of a firearm must be in compliance with AFI 31-117. (T-1) 8.8.  Escape of Pretrial Detainee or  Post-trial  Inmate.  For the purposes of apprehension and return  to  military  control,  an  escapee  is:  1)  any  person  who  is  absent  from  custody  or confinement; or, 2) if paroled is in material non-compliance with the Conditions of Parole (CoP) and the AFC&PB has an ordered a warrant to be issued; or, 3) fails to return as directed. (T-1) 8.8.1.  In  cases  of  confinees  who  are  members  of  other  Services,  notify  AFSFC/SFCT  for assistance in cross-Service notification and other cross-Service requirements. (T-1) 8.8.2.  If a detainee or inmate escapes, the confinement staff immediately prepares DD Form 553,  Deserter/Absentee  Wanted  by  the  Armed  Forces,  and  distributes  the  form  pursuant  to the provisions of AFI 36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence. In addition, the DFC, installation  commander,  or  designated representative  directly  and  expeditiously communicates with the civilian police agencies nearest to the installation, an escapee’s home of  record,  home  of  spouse,  etc.,  and  other  logical  sources  requesting  assistance  in apprehending. (T-1) Additionally the confinement officer or NCO: 8.8.2.1.  Notifies their chain up to and including MAJCOM/A4S and AFSFC/SFC. (T-1) 8.8.2.2.  Ensures VWAP notifications are made. (T-0) 8.8.2.3.  Completes AF Form 807 to inventory escapee’s property and personal effects as soon as possible after escape. (T-1) 8.8.2.4.  Ensures  escapees  who  are  not  captured  within  90  days  are  dropped  from confinement  accountability  rolls;  however,  retain  the  CTF  at  the  facility.  Return  any personal property to the parent unit for disposition. Turn funds over to the servicing FSO, which holds the funds until the confinee is returned to military control. Make the check payable to the servicing FSO or as directed. (T-1) 8.8.2.5.  Prepares  a  lessons  learned  report  and  forwards  to  AFSFC  within  30  days  of escape. (T-1) 8.8.3.  When  an  escapee  is  located  in  the  custody  of  civil  authorities,  place  a  detainer  (in coordination with SJA) with the civil authorities for return of the escapee to military control. The  nearest  AF  installation  SF  unit  is  responsible  for  returning  the  escapee  to  military control.  For  travel  expenditures  used  to  return  absentees,  deserters,  and  escapees,  reference AFI 65-601Vl, Budget Guidance and Procedures, paragraph 12.7. Complete DD Form 616, Report of Return of Absentee, and distribute per instructions in AFI 36-2911. (T-1) 8.8.4.  Once  escapee  is  returned  to  military  control,  conduct  a  medical  examination  for communicable or contagious diseases. Test for HIV, TB, Hep-B, pregnancy (as applicable), and drugs within 24-hours of the return. (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 95 8.8.5.  If  a  confinee  escapes  during  a  transfer,  the  transferring  (losing)  installation  is responsible  for  the  procedures  indicated  above,  as  well  as  telephonic  notifications  and reporting procedures, unless otherwise directed by AFSFC/SFC. (T-1) 8.8.6.  Have  SFI  or  AFOSI  conduct  investigation  of  escapes  and  major  disturbances,  as appropriate. (T-1) 8.9.  Suicide  Prevention.  Confinement  officers  consult  with  medical  authorities  to  determine when  a  suicide  watch  is  necessary  to  prevent  injury.  The  confinement  officer  develops procedures  to  ensure  the  safety  of  identified  suicidal  confines,  as  well  as  ensure  all  confined spaces  in  the  facility  prevent  easy  access/ability  to  commit  suicide  (e.g.,  no  place  to  attach  a noose,  no  plastic  bags  large  enough  to  cover  the  head  for  suffocation,  no  storage  of  harmful cleaning fluids in cell area, accurate control of medications, etc.). Seek a medical review of the mental and physical well-being of identified suicidal confinees at a minimum of every 24-hours. A medical authority should determine when suicide watch is removed. The DFC, or designated SNCO  or  above  on  non-duty  days,  conducts  a  daily  documented  visit  to  confinees  on  suicide watch. (T-1) 8.9.1.  Suicide watch cells may not contain anything a confinee may use to self-inflict injury. Items to be considered for removal may include belts, safety razors, removable or breakable hard plastics or metal objects (including bed parts), or glass. (T-1) 8.9.1.1.  Ensure  suicide  watch  cells  have  hard  deck  ceilings  and  walls/fixtures  that prevent hanging. (T-1) 8.9.1.2.  Confinement officer ensures the CF has a cut-down tool readily available should an  attempted  hanging  be  discovered.  To  obtain  a  suitable  tool,  research  available  law enforcement  and  prison  equipment  catalogs  to  select  an  appropriate  tool  for  that particular CF. The confinement officer ensures procedures for its use are developed and staff  members  are  familiar  with  its  use.  The  best  method  involves  at  least  two  staff members  –  one  to  cut  and  one  to  catch.  Every  situation  is  different.  First  priority  is lifesaving  after the alarm  is  sounded.  If only one staff member is  readily  available  - do not delay the cut while waiting for a second. (T-1) 8.9.2.  Confinement  staff/escorts  conduct  frequent  (not  to  exceed  15  minutes)  randomly spaced cell checks for those on suicide watch. The confinement officer determines if active constant  CCTV  monitoring  of  suicide  watch  is  sufficient  instead  of  15-minute  physical checks. Regardless of the manner used, staff/escort records checks on a DD Form 509. (T-0) 8.9.2.1.  NOTE  1:  Use  of  CCTV  does  not  eliminate  the  benefits  of  random  physical checks. 8.9.2.2.  NOTE 2:  Maintain CCTV recordings (with proper markings) only if needed for evidence. Store/secure as appropriate. 8.9.3.  Confinement  officer  ensures  only  same  gender  staff  monitors  CCTV  and  conducts physical checks of suicidal confinees. (T-0) 8.9.4.  Confinement  officer  in  consultation  with  SJA  and  medical  authorities  may  consider moving long term suicidal confinees to mental health care facilities (i.e., 24-medical staff and locked wards). (T-1) 96 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 8.10.  First  Responder.  Life  and  safety  are  primary  responsibilities.  Prioritize  lifesaving  first. Once  life  threatening  circumstances  are  addressed  conduct  appropriate  policing  actions  for prevention  of  escalation  (e.g.,  separate  the  sides  of  a  fight/disturbance  or  sexual  abuse,  etc.), preservation of evidence, and priority.

D&A Bds are established to recommend to the DFC whether disciplinary action should be taken against a confinee for misconduct, rules violations,  or  behavioral  adjustment  problems.  The  DD  Form  2714,  Prisoner  Disciplinary Report/Action, is used to report confinee infractions of rules and regulations. (T-0) 9.1.1.  The D&A Bd is appointed by the DFC and is composed of three disinterested military members  and  chaired  by  an  E-7  or  above.  Board  members  may  not  be  from  the  SF  unit  or from  the  confinee’s  parent  unit.  (T-1)  A  confinee  is  given  notice  of  a  D&A  Bd  and  given reasonable opportunity to prepare a written and/or oral statement for the board based on the indicated  offense(s).  Notice  includes  reminding  the  confine  of  the  minimum  and  maximum possible  disciplinary  actions  if  determined  to  be  at  fault  for  the  indicated  offense  category (see paragraph 9.1.5.). The board reviews the evidence and confinee’s statement. If the board finds fault it makes disciplinary recommendations to the DFC with the goal being to use the least  amount  of  disciplinary  action  necessary  to  positively  modify  the  confinee’s  behavior. The  board’s  recommendation  is  not  binding  on  the  DFC,  per  DoDI  1325.07,  paragraph 10.g.(1). However, if the DFC disagrees with the board’s recommendation, written notice is provided  to  the  confinee  with  reasons  for  the  decision.  As  part  of  the  decision  process,  the DFC  considers  if  the  confinee’s  documented  mental  health  fitness  (mental  disabilities  or mental  illness)  contributed  to  the  behavior  in  question.  Only  the  DFC,  or  acting  DFC,  can impose/remove disciplinary actions. (T-0) 9.1.2.  The D&A Bd is authorized to recommend and the DFC is authorized to impose one or more  disciplinary  measures  on  a  confinee  under  their  jurisdiction  for  misconduct  or infraction of regulations, including: 9.1.2.1.  Reprimand or warning. (T-0) 9.1.2.2.  Loss of one or more privileges, or restrictions on movement or activities. (T-0) 9.1.2.3.  Extra duty. (T-0) 9.1.2.4.  Decrease of custody  classification.  (Change to  a more restrictive classification) (T-0) 9.1.2.5.  Forfeiture or suspension of earned GCT, earned time (ET) abatement, or special acts abatement (SAA). (T-0) 9.1.2.6.  Disciplinary segregation with a recommended time limit. (T-0) 9.1.2.7.  Restitution for damages or loss of property belonging to the facility or persons. (T-0) 9.1.3.  A suspension period of any disciplinary measure may not exceed 6 months. (T-0) 9.1.4.  The  DFC  may  restore  any  action  imposed  as  a  disciplinary  measure,  including suspended or forfeited earned GCT, ET, or SAA from any prior commander or activity. (T-0 98 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 9.1.5.  Following  are  possible  violations  and  recommended  actions.  Ensure  the  rulebook clearly establishes acceptable and unacceptable behavior.

Other recommendations considering extenuating circumstances and the violation 9.2.  Administrative  or  Disciplinary  Segregation  Actions  .  Segregation  is  used  to;  enforce discipline standards, prevent injury, provide for observation, or maintain health. Administrative segregation  is  used  for  newly  arrived  confinees  to  allow  staff  observation  and  the  confinee  to acclimate to their new situation (see paragraph 5.5.5. for time lines.) Administrative segregation includes  situations  involving  temporary  medical  situations  (flu,  limbs  with  casts,  etc.)  and provides  a  secure  setting  for  isolation.  Administrative  segregation  also  includes  protective 102 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 custody  or  may  include  when  awaiting  results  from  D&A  Bd.  Disciplinary  segregation  is  for rules violation(s) and used to affect behavior modifications. Staff keeps all segregated confinees under  close  supervision,  conducting  frequent  checks  throughout  the  24-hour  day.  The  DFC,  or designated SNCO or above on non-duty days, conducts daily documented visits to confinees in disciplinary segregation. Do not mix administrative and disciplinary segregation confinees. Keep protective  custody  confinees  away  from  all  other  confinees.  Segregation  of  confinees  based solely on sexual orientation is prohibited, unless as a result of a legal decree/settlement or court order.  NOTE:  See  DoDI  1325.07,  Enclosure  2,  Paragraph  10,  for  additional  medical requirements and segregation timeline requirements. (T-0) 9.2.1.  For  administrative  segregation  (not  including  medical  reasons)  or  protective  custody segregation, if DFC decides to continue segregation past 72-hours, the D&A Bd will review on  the  seventh  day  after  segregation  begins  and  every  7  days  thereafter  to  determine  to continue  to  recommend  segregation.  After  2  months,  if  continuation  is  still  warranted,  the D&A Bd reviews every 30 days. NOTE: See DoDI 1325.07, Enclosure 2, Paragraph 10, for additional medical requirements and segregation timeline requirements. (T-0) 9.2.1.1.  For  medical  segregation,  keep  the  confinee  in  this  form  of  segregation  if  the ability to protect themselves in a disturbance or the ability to evacuate in an emergency is limited  (e.g.,  medical  ordered  bed  rest  for  the  flu  or  use  of  crutches).  Not  only  are confinees  with  prescribed  medical  aids,  such  as  crutches,  physically  hindered  but crutches introduce a weapon into the general population that could be used by this or any other confinee as a weapon, thus the need to segregate.(T-0) 9.2.1.2.  If a confinee infraction or behavior is so severe it is believed to be detrimental to the  good order of the facility, the confinee may  be placed in administrative segregation awaiting  the  D&A  Bd  to  consider  their  case.  However,  placement  into  administrative segregation is not a prerequisite to be considered for disciplinary segregation. 9.2.1.3.  For administrative segregations occurring after the initial incarceration, the DFC convenes the D&A Bd as soon as practical, do not allow extended delays. 9.2.1.3.1.  NOTE:  See  DoDI  1325.07,  Enclosure  2,  Paragraph  10,  for  additional medical requirements and segregation timeline requirements. 9.2.2.  When a confinee is transferred to segregation for either administrative or disciplinary reasons,  health  care  personnel  are  to  be  informed  immediately  and  provide  assessment  and review  as  indicated  by  the  protocols  established  by  the  facility’s  health  authority  (MTF). Thereafter, medical personnel are to visit the confinee in segregation at least once every day to  observe  the  confinee’s  health  and  the  sanitary  conditions  of  the  segregation.  Medical personnel document their visits and are to immediately inform the DFC of any unhealthful, unsafe, or unsanitary conditions. DFC ensures immediate and appropriate action is taken to correct any noted problem or unhealthful condition. 9.2.2.1.  NOTE:  See  DoDI  1325.07,  Enclosure  2,  Paragraph  10,  for  additional  medical requirements and segregation timeline requirements. 9.2.3.  Continuous  confinement  after  30  days  in  any  form  of  segregation  or  protective custody requires the review and approval of the DFC. Continuous segregation after 30 days also  requires  a  qualified/privileged  Mental  Health  provider  to  personally  interview  and prepare  a  written  report  on  any  confinee  remaining  in  segregation  over  30  days.  If AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 103 segregation  continues,  a  mental  health  assessment  by  a  qualified/privileged  Mental  Health provider  is  made  at  least  every  3  months  from  the  segregation  placement  date  –  or  more frequently,  if  prescribed  by  the  MTF  commander.  Confinement  staff  records  medical evaluation  visits  on  DD  Form  509,  as  well  as  the  SF  and  confinement  blotters  with  care provider’s name/rank and visit duration. (T-0) 9.2.3.1.  NOTE:  See  DoDI  1325.07,  Enclosure  2,  Paragraph  10,  for  addition  medical requirements and segregation timeline requirements. 9.2.4.  Temporary  Removal  of  Cell  Furnishings.  The  control  of  property  and  temporary removal  of  furniture  requires  approval  from  the  DFC.  Confinees  in  segregation  are  to  be provided adequate clothing and sleeping accommodations with sufficient bedding, and when requested  by  the  confine,  religious  books  and  other  self-improvement  books  and  guides,  as appropriate.  These  items  can  also  be  removed  at  the  discretion  of  the  DFC  when  the temporary removal of these items is necessary to prevent damage to property or injury to the confinee  or  others.  If  the  confinee  shows  sufficient  destructive  behavior  or  tendencies, contact the MTF to consider medical sedation and/or placement in a more secure facility or locked medical ward. Contact AFSFC/SFC if further instructions are needed. (T-0) 104 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 Chapter 10 DETAINEE/INMATE TRANSFERS 10.1.  Pre-Transfer  Requirements.  Transfer  approvals  for  all  confinees  within  the  AFCS  are made by AFSFC/SFCT, except those transfers within the guidelines of previously AFSFC/SFC coordinated  and  approved  SA  or  contracts.  Determine  if  confinee  is  to  remain  local  or  if  a transfer request is needed. See AFM 31-127 for additional information. NOTE: Historically, the vast  majority  of  pretrial  detainees  do  not  move  from  the  local  area;  however,  if  it  becomes necessary, ensure decision has support of the SJA and contact AFSFC/SFC for assistance. (T-1) 10.1.1.  Parent units are responsible for the inmate's orders and transportation arrangements. The  confinement  staff  and  parent  unit  select  preferred  request  date(s)  for  transfer.  The confinement NCO provides the date requested to AFSFC/SFCT which has up to 5 duty days to respond. Ensure sufficient lead time is built into the requested date. (T-1) 10.1.1.1.  NOTE:  Historically,  a  10  duty  day  lead  time  works  best  to  allow  for  travel ticketing, etc. 10.1.2.  Prior  to  transfer,  the  confinement  staff  conducts  a  pre-transfer  conference  with  the inmate (see paragraph 10.2.) (T-0) 10.1.3.  The inmate’s original CTF accompanies the inmate and is hand-carried by the escort. (T-1) 10.1.4.  Ensure the parent unit provides documents relating to security clearance suspension or withdrawal for inclusion in the CTF. (T-1) 10.1.5.  Ensure  the  parent  unit  provides  a  copy  of  the  promulgating  order  (court-martial order)  as  soon  as  it  is  published  (forward  to  AFSFC/SFCT)  to  assist  in  determining reassignment action. (T-1) 10.1.5.1.  Inmates without an adjudged discharge administratively remain assigned to the parent unit. (See current AFPC PGMs on Appellate Leave Responsibilities.) (T-1) 10.1.6.  Prior to  transfer, make  all necessary victim/witness notifications and ensure all DD Forms 2704 and 2705 are sealed in a separate envelope and placed with the CTF. (T-0) 10.1.7.  Determine  if,  at  the  time  of  transfer,  medical  recertification  of  fitness  for confinement is required. A break of confinement, for periods over 24-hours, requires a new physical  examination.  Examinations  may  be  requested  for  shorter  periods  of  break  when circumstances  indicate  cause.  Confinees  transferred  between  facilities  normally  do  not require a new medical certification unless deemed appropriate by either the receiving facility (check with receiving facility before departing). (T-0) 10.1.7.1.  The  medical  officer  annotates  the  recertification  in  the  health  record  or computer generated form, for inmates with confinement interruptions. Escorts ensure this document is readily accessible upon arrival. (T-0) 10.1.7.2.  Confinees  determined  by  a  qualified/privileged  Mental  Health  provider  to  be mentally  unstable  are  to  be  segregated  from  other  confinees.  The  MTF  determines whether a medical attendant should accompany the escort. If the confinee requires special AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 105 medical  attention,  consider  transferring  through  medical  channels.  Provide  escorts  IAW custody requirements. (T-0) 10.1.8.  Ensure  VWAP  and  sex  offender  notifications  have  been  accomplished  (i.e.,  ensure DD Form 2791 was placed in the member’s UPRG/CTF/facility files). (T-0) 10.2.  Pre-Transfer  Conference.  The inmate’s  commander  or  appointed representative,  and  confinement  officer  attend  the  conference  to  explain  the  purpose  of  the transfer and resolve the disposition of property and funds. (T-1) The confinement officer or unit representative, as appropriate: inmate, the 10.2.1.  Confinement office schedules the conference just prior to  transfer. Ensure adequate time  is  provided  for  the  inmate  to  accomplish  any  personal  actions  prior  to  transfer.  For safety reasons, neither the inmate nor anyone without a need to know is to be informed of the exact date and time for transfer. (T-1) 10.2.2.  Parent unit advises the inmate of dependent travel and shipping entitlements. 10.2.2.1.  Single  and  divorced  members  without  dependents,  need  to  refer  to  the  most current JTR to determine entitlements. (T-0) 10.2.2.2.  CONUS inmates with authorized dependents use JTR para U5370-H;1-2. (T-0) 10.2.2.3.  OCONUS  inmates  with  or  without  dependents  coming  from  an  overseas location (their previous assignment) may ship household goods to the home of record or designated place according to JTR para U5900-D, 2h, 1-9. (T-0) 10.2.2.4.  Personal property or household goods do not accompany inmate to the gaining facility. (T-0) 10.2.3.  Confiscate  inmate  and  dependent  Armed  Forces  identification  cards.  Place  the inmate’s Armed Forces identification card in the CTF prior to transfer. The inmate’s parent unit  issues  dependents  new  cards  according  to  AFI  36-3026  (I),  Identification  Cards  for Members  of  the  Uniformed  Services,  Their  Eligible  Family  Members  and  Other  Eligible Personnel. (T-1) 10.2.4.  The  time  just  before  transfer  may  be  a  period  of  emotional  turmoil  for  the  inmate; consideration  should  be  given  to  increased  checks  or  changing  inmate’s  custody classification, if warranted. (T-1) 10.3.  Confinement Officer’s Transfer Responsibilities  . The confinement officer ensures unit escorts are trained and ensures at least one escort is of the same gender as the inmate. (T-0) Brief escorts on: 10.3.1.  Mode  of  transportation  and  security  requirements  based  on  inmate’s  custody classification. (T-1) 10.3.2.  Procedures  and  arrangements  for  delays  or  stopovers  and  delivery;  procedures  for inmate illness, escape, or injury; and procedures for uncontrollable or unstable inmates. (T-1) 10.3.3.  Inmate clothing and equipment requirements and receipt of inmate’s property. (T-0) 10.3.4.  Expected  escort  performance,  conduct,  and  compliance  with  AF  appearance standards. (T-1) 106 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 10.3.5.  Receipt requirements for medically transferred inmates. (T-0) 10.3.6.  Need for several blank DD Forms 2708 and their use. (T-1) 10.3.7.  Escort responsibilities as outlined in paragraph 8.3. (T-1) 10.4.  Transfer  of  Confinees.  Installations  unable  to  confine  pretrial  detainees  should  contact AFSFC/SFCT.  The  CAs  designate  confinement  for  court-martialed  (convicted)  offenders according to AFI 51-201. Inmates serving confinement sentences under AF control and have the minimum length necessary to obtain offense related rehabilitation, usually transfer to a Level II or  III  facility  so  they  can  capitalize  on  treatment  programs.  In  order  to  keep  track  of  all  AF inmate  transfers,  AFSFC/SFC  directs  these  transfers.  Many  situations  can  be  solved  early  if AFSFC/SFCT is involved especially in the trial preparation stages, in case the result of trial is a conviction. If the confinement officer has questions, contact AFSFC/SFCT directly. (T-1) 10.4.1.  Post-trial  inmates  may  be  transferred  at  the  direction  of  AFSFC/SFC  to  the appropriate  level  facility  following  their  court-martial.  Normally,  inmates  are  housed  in  a Level I facility while pending CA action unless circumstances warrant immediate transfer or delay  in  transfer.  Post-trial  inmates  in  Level  I  CFs,  normally  should  have  90-days  or  more confinement remaining on their sentence for a transfer to be cost effective. Justify deviations from  these  minimum  time  requirements  in  the  transfer  request  so  AFSFC/SFC  may successfully seek approval from appropriate Level II Service HQs. (T-1) 10.4.2.  To  initiate  a  transfer  of  an  AF  inmate,  the  confinement  officer  or  NCO  sends  a transfer  request  message  via  Microsoft  Outlook  Email  (encrypted/digital  signature)  to AFSFC/SFC:  afsfc.sfct@us.af.mil.  To  ensure  coordination  of  this  transfer,  send  a  copy  to the inmate’s unit, SJA, CA, and MAJCOM/A4S. Use the message format in Attachment 17 to  request  transfers.  Justify  requests  for  immediate  or  delay  in  transfer  in  paragraph  14. Compute  clemency,  parole,  and  minimum  and  maximum  release  dates  according  to  DoD 1325.7-M,  DoD  Sentence  Computation.  In  addition  to  the  message,  fax/e-mail  copy  of  the following:  DD  Form  2707,  DD  Form  2707-1  or  computer  generated  form  (or,  AF  Form 1359, until rescinded), DD FM 2704, Victim/Witness Certification and Election Concerning Inmate Status, and if applicable, the Pretrial Agreement to AFSFC/SFCT. (T-1) 10.4.3.  Housing inmates in Army correctional facilities requires a SA. AFSFC/SFC approves all  other  transfers  to  Army  facilities  after  coordination  with  HQ  Department  of  the  Army, Provost Marshal General (PMG), Army Corrections Command. (T-0) 10.4.4.  When notified of a pending court-martial, where bed space in the Level I CF or local support facilities is not available, pre-coordinate a request for immediate transfer. Provisions for an immediate transfer after the court-martial is considered individually. (T-1) 10.4.5.  AFSFC/SFC  responds  within  5  duty  days  of  receiving  transfer  requests.  Approval messages  are  sent  to  the  confinement  facility,  parent  unit,  FSS,  SJA,  CA,  Comptroller  Sq, and AFPC. (T-1) 10.5.  Out-Processing and Assigning Transfer Escorts.  The parent unit is responsible to out-process the inmate from the installation. When the transfer of an inmate has been requested and is  approved  for  continued  confinement  at  a  Level  II  facility  or  higher,  the  inmate’s  parent  unit commander  provides  escort  personnel  consistent  with  custody  classification  and  security requirements  unless  it  is  locally  determined  that  SF  escort  is  the  better  option.  The  inmate’s AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 107 parent  unit  under  provisions  in  AFI  65-601V1,  Budget  Guidance  and  Procedures,  paragraph 10.2.1., provides funding of escorts. (T-1) Escorts are assigned under the following criteria: 10.5.1.  All  inmates  are  escorted,  regardless  of  previous  rank/status.  SF  will  conduct  the escort  and the parent unit provides the  funding when SF  escorts  are required due to  safety, maximum  custody,  or  the  commercial  airline  requires  law  enforcement  escort.  Otherwise, parent unit provides the escorts. (T-1) 10.5.2.  Transfer escorts from the parent unit must be at least an E-5/DoD civilian equivalent. Security  Forces  escorts  in  the  grade  of  E-4/DoD  civilian  equivalent  or  higher  may  be  a transfer escort. (T-1) 10.5.3.  Never assign escorts who may sympathize with or are biased against the inmate. (T-1) 10.5.4.  An  escort  must be  the  same  gender  as  the  inmate;  however,  if  assigning  more  than one escort at least one must be the same gender. (T-0) 10.5.5.  When transferring by vehicle, parent unit provides driver and escorts (if not locally determined, the driver and escorts should be SF). (T-1) 10.5.6.  Preventive  measures  should  be  taken  to  protect  escorts  against  blood  borne pathogens (e.g., carrying latex gloves and disposal bags). (T-1) 10.6.  Confinement  Staff  Actions.  Upon  receipt  of  transfer  approval  message,  the  assigned escort makes telephonic contact with the AF liaison or gaining facility staff to obtain information on local travel conditions and to coordinate a pick up detail or escort accommodations. Verify all required documents are in the CTF and the inmate has all clothing and H&C items required for the facility. Ensure inmates arrive with documentation, which clearly indicates their legal status and sentence as imposed by a military court (or as modified by subsequent CA action). Include copies of DD Form 2707, deferment orders, accurate documentation of pretrial confinement, and documentation  relative  to  any  emotional  or  behavioral  problems.  NOTE:  Include  a  record  of trial (if required by AFMAN 51-203, Records of Trial, and when available). (T-0) 10.6.1.  When  classifying  inmates  for  transfer  to  a  Level  III  facility,  as  required  by  DoDI 1325.07,  forward  the  Report  of  Investigation  (no  exceptions)  IAW  with  AFOSI  71-121, Processing and Reporting Investigative Matters, to: Commandant, United States Disciplinary Barracks, Director of Inmate Administration, 1301 N. Warehouse Road, Ft Leavenworth KS 66027-2304. (T-0) 10.6.2.  Once travel arrangements have been made, the confinement officer/NCO requesting transfer sends an itinerary message to AFSFC/SFC and the gaining CF NLT 72-hours prior to the  inmate’s  departure.  Confinement  staff  ensures  escort  selection  is  based  upon  custody classification.  Include  the  inmate’s  name,  parent  unit,  estimated  departure  date  and  time, mode of travel (airline and flight number, government vehicle, etc.) and grade and name of escorts. (T-1) 10.6.3.  The  inmate’s  parent  unit  ensures  MilPDS  records  are  updated  prior  to  the  transfer. Escorts  do  not  hand-carry  the  Unit  Personnel  Records  Group  (UPRG)  to  the  designated confinement facility. (T-1) 10.6.3.1.  The inmate’s  FSS forwards the  UPRG and a current  records review report on individual duty within 15-days after transfer, to AFSFC/SFCP, 1517 Billy Mitchell Blvd, 108 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 JBSA  Lackland  TX  78236-0119.  After  the  inmate  arrives  at  the  gaining  facility, AFSFC/SFCP updates e-ARMS data. (T-1) 10.6.3.2.  Prior to the transfer, the inmate’s MTF will provide the escorts with a complete copy of the Service Treatment Record (STR). The MTF mails the original STR to: 59th Medical  Wing,  Wilford  Hall  Ambulatory  Surgical  Center,  ATTENTION:  Outpatient Medical  Records  Dept,  2200  Bergquist  Drive  Suite  1,  JB  San  Antonio-Lackland  TX 78236-9908. (T-1) 10.6.3.2.1.  NOTE:  For  additional  information  pertaining  to  medical  records  for those placed in Confinee or Appellate Review Leave status; see AFI 41-210, Tricare Operations and Patient Administration Functions, Paragraph 5.7.3. 10.6.4.  Inmates  are  transferred  with  permanent  change  of  station  (PCS)  orders.  When transfers  are  completed  prior  to  CA  action,  ensure  orders  reflect  PCS  without  permanent change of assignment (PCA). (T-1) 10.7.  Determining  AFSFC/SFC  Gain  of  Inmates.  AFSFC/SFC  cannot  gain  AF  inmates  (to relinquish the unit and base of the inmate) until the Court Martial Convening Authority (CMCA) completes  the  action.  Additionally,  the  inmate  must  have  received  a  punitive  discharge  and normally have 120 days remaining before parole or expiration of sentence. Inmates not receiving a punitive discharge upon completion of confinement are returned to the parent unit. However, given  the  time  available,  should  the  parent  unit  (wing)  administratively  discharge  the  inmate prior  to  release  from  confinement,  the  inmate  does  not  need  to  return  to  the  unit  upon  release from  confinement  if  proceeding  on  parole  or  expiration  of  sentence.  For  specific  guidance  on orders, refer to the appropriate AFPC PSDG. (T-1) 10.7.1.  Level  I  facilities  notify  AFSFC/SFC  at  least  10  duty  days  prior  to  the  requested action date to facilitate processing of all pertinent documents. Prior to AFSFC/SFC gaining an inmate, all required clothing and administrative items must be complete. (T-1) 10.8.  Transfers  From  OCONUS.  When  transferring  an  adjudged  inmate  from  overseas, accomplish the following actions prior to arrival at a CONUS location: 10.8.1.  When the sentence to confinement has not expired and either, 1) a punitive discharge is  pending,  or  2)  no  discharge  is  pending,  then  the  overseas  commander  should  seek  to ensure  the  inmate  is  transferred  with  at  least  90  days  or  more  remaining  on  their  sentence. Historically, transferring with less than 90 days remaining creates unique administrative and fiscal  challenges  in  locating  an  available  short  term  CONUS  bed  space;  however,  given sufficient  time,  AFSFC/SFC  may  be  able  to  secure  a  CONUS  bed  space.  In  both  of  these situations, after the inmate arrives at the CONUS facility and if not otherwise prohibited in personnel  instructions,  AFSFC/SFCP  begins  the  process  to  force  gain  the  individual’s records from the parent unit. (T-1) 10.8.1.1.  NOTE:  Specific  personnel  actions  are  contained  in  AFPC’s  most  current PSDG. 10.8.2.  When  the  inmate  completes  confinement  overseas  and  is  awaiting  completion  of appellate  review  and  subsequent  execution  of  an  approved  punitive  discharge,  the  overseas commander  places  the  member  on  required  excess  leave  IAW  AFI  51-201  and  returns  the former inmate to Home of Record or other location as appropriate/authorized. (T-1) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 109 10.9.  Confinee  Movement  Aboard  Commercial  Aircraft  .  The  Transportation  Security Administration  (TSA)  provides  guidance  for  transporting  military  confinees  IAW  Code  for Federal Regulations. Refer to AFMAN 31-127, Security Forces Armed/Unarmed Transfer Team Procedures. Additional requirements are necessary when flying armed, e.g., movement of high-risk (maximum) confinee. AFMAN 31-127 details the TSA’s requirements for Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) Flying Armed. (T-0) 10.10.  Confinee Movement Aboard Military Aircraft.  Refer to AFMAN 31-127 for transfers conducted using military aircraft. 10.11.  Confinee  Movement  Aboard  Ground  Transportation.  Use  appropriate  number  of escorts for the custody classification. The driver does not count as an escort.  (T-0)  In addition, escorts: 10.11.1.  Use government or government rented vehicles. (T-0) 10.11.2.  When using restraints, do not restrain confinee to the vehicle except for proper use of seat belts. (T-0) 10.11.3.  Limit  stops  to  those  needed  for  rest,  fuel,  and  emergencies.  Escorts  do  not  let confinees influence the selection of a stop location as it could be a ruse for an escape attempt. (T-0) 10.12.  Transfer  Escort  Responsibilities.  Escorts  monitor  the  appearance  and  conduct  of confinees.  Restrain  the  hands  (handcuffs  or  Hoffman  Cuffs  ™,  as  appropriate).  Avoid  crowds and actions that cause public attention. Escorts/confinees wear appropriate attire for the situation (uniform or civilian clothes) as directed by the DFC. Escorts/confinees do not consume alcohol during the transfer. (T-0) 10.13.  Appearance  of  Confinees  as  Defendants  and  Witnesses  at  Civil  or  Military Proceedings. 10.13.1.  Defendant/Witness in Civil proceedings. Regarding the appearance of confinees as a  defendant  or  witness  in  legal  proceedings  in  which  the  US  Federal  Government  does  not have a vested interest, the temporary custody release of a confinee from the facility requires prior  approval.  Facilities  should  cooperate  to  the  extent  practicable  with  civil  authorities  in the  appearance  of  confinees  as  defendants  or  witnesses.  If  the  confinee  remains  local, approval  is  obtained  from  the  DFC  after  coordination  with  SJA.  Confinees  should  not  be released from the control of the Department of the Air Force without coordination with SJA and a retainer issued to and accepted by the civil authorities. Costs of transportation, housing, meals, and H&C items are the responsibility of the requesting civil authorities and identified in  a  memorandum.  If  the  confinee  does  not  remain  locally;  consult  with  SJA  and  contact AFSFC/SFC. (T-1) 10.13.1.1.  A formal request (written memorandum) for temporary release/custody by the requesting  agency  of  the  above  provisions  is  required.  The  local  SJA  reviews  and forwards  recommendations  to  AFSFC/SFC  to  approve/arrange  for  temporary  custody, especially  involving  non-local  movement.  If  the  confinee  has  been  gained  by AFSFC/SFC, the legal review is done by AFDW/JA. (T-1) 10.13.2.  Defendant/Witness in Military proceedings. If a confinee’s presence is required as a defendant or witness in a court-martial, or other military legal proceeding, and the confinee 110 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 has not transferred, the SJA coordinates the appearance with the local confinement officer. If the  confinee  has  transferred  to  another  facility  (no  longer  local),  SJA  coordination  is  by memorandum  with  AFSFC/SFC.  The  memorandum  should  include,  but  is  not  limited  to: fund cites to cover the cost of transportation, temporary confinement location and funds for housing (if required), specific dates required (consider additional pretrial preparation time if needed), meals for confinees and accompanying escorts, and H&C items (as required). Refer to AFI 51-201, Table 6.1. for funding guidelines. (T-1) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 111 Chapter 11 REHABILITATION SERVICES 11.1.  Required Level I Programs.  Participation in daily activities which promote regular work assignments,  offense  related  rehabilitation,  physical  fitness,  and  formal  education/training (including  self-improvement)  increases  usefulness,  prevents  idleness,  and  aids  in  alleviating custody problems while preparing for release and successful community reentry. Participation in programs should be based upon facility resources and needs, as well as confinee’s needs in terms of  status,  custody,  capability,  and  motivation  for  successful  adjustment  and  preparation  for release.  The  time  spent  in  work  assignments,  rehabilitation,  and  education/training  should approximate  the  work  day  in  the  community.  NOTE:  Due  to  security  and  transportation requirements,  it  is  usually  difficult  to  accommodate  a  full  8-hour  work  day.  Setting  a  32-hour work  week  as  a  goal  is  realistic  given  the  extra  admin  time  needed  for  processing,  including transportation  to/from  mid-day  meal  and  individual  searches  upon  return  to  the  facility.  The purpose is to keep inmates active in work, education, and rehabilitation efforts. 11.1.1.  Work  Programs/Job  Outlets.  Confinement  officers  set  up  local  inmate  work programs  that  are  consistent  with  custody  level  and  civilian  employment  potential  to  the fullest extent practicable. Inmates should perform duties or services that contribute to the AF mission, as well as the inmate's rehabilitation. Use DD Form 2712,  Prisoner Evaluation, to record the work assignments and performance. (T-0) 11.1.1.1.  The  confinement  staff  assigns  tasks  which  confinees  may  perform.  When assigning work to inmates: 11.1.1.2.  Do not assign work to pretrial detainees. They should perform  house-cleaning tasks along with post-trial inmates in their cell, bay, or dormitory. They may volunteer, in writing,  for  work  assignments  which  may  or  may  not  be  commensurate  with  their rank/grade. (T-0) 11.1.1.3.  Inmates should work in a job outlet (during normal duty hours) commensurate with their custody classification. When possible, assignments should focus on using their military skill or obtaining and learning a skill the inmate may use upon release. This does not preclude periodically assigning inmates to details such as base litter patrol. When the DFC  approves,  inmates  in  minimum  custody  classification  may  work  within  their  Air Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC).  Inmates  with  special  skills  (e.g.,  mechanic,  electrician, carpenter,  etc.)  should  receive  work  assignments  to  put  their  skills  to  productive  use under  appropriate  supervision.  Brief  escorts  and  work  outlet  supervisors  on  escort procedures  and  restrictions  to  inmate  employment.  Document  the  initial  briefing  and receive written acknowledgment from work outlet supervisors and escorts. (T-0) 11.1.1.4.  Consider confinees in an on-duty status, except for periods of mandatory sleep, meals,  visitation,  periods  as  determined  by  a  medical  officer,  and  during  periods  of voluntary  religious  observations  as  determined  by  confinement  officer  in  coordination with installation chaplain. (T-1) 11.1.2.  Prohibit the following types of confinee employment: 11.1.2.1.  Operating a vehicle, including forklifts, tugs, front end loaders, etc. (T-0) 112 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 11.1.2.2.  Handling classified material, medical or behavioral health records, personal or official  mail,  personal  property,  funds,  or  sensitive  files.  This  includes  For  Official  use Only (FOUO) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) documents. (T-0) 11.1.2.3.  Working  with  hazardous  materials,  such  as  drugs,  intoxicants,  firearms,  or munitions. (T-0) 11.1.2.4.  Providing personal services or working in an authoritative capacity over others. (T-0) 11.1.2.5.  Labor  which  is  inherently  more  hazardous  than  that  required  of  active  duty personnel,  violates  civilian  labor  contracts,  or  under  the  supervision  of  a  non-DoD foreign national. (T-0) 11.1.2.6.  Labor  which  permits  close  association  with  opposite  gender,  unless  closely supervised. (T-0) 11.1.2.7.  Labor which may bring financial gain to inmates or the confinement staff, may bring criticism to the US military, or violates DoD standards of conduct. (T-0) 11.1.2.8.  Performing  work  details  outside  the  facility  on  Sundays  and  federal  holidays unless the inmate(s) volunteer in writing. Non-Christians who practice their religion and non-religious individuals will share in the Sunday and federal holiday exception, or will be reasonably accommodated when practical. (T-0) 11.1.2.9.  Work details within close proximity of schools, day/childcare, or like facilities, as  reasonably  determined  by  the  DFC  considering  confining  offenses  and  installation’s physical layout. (T-1) 11.2.  Correctional Treatment Programs.  Rehabilitation, education, and training programs are equal in importance to work assignments. (T-0) 11.2.1.  As available, ensure access to: 11.2.1.1.  Mental Health counseling. (T-0) 11.2.1.2.  Drug and alcohol counseling (if diagnosed or offense related). (T-0) 11.2.1.3.  Self-growth  groups,  e.g.,  AA  and  NA.  If  groups  are  unavailable  on  base,  the confinement officer should attempt to arrange visits by facilitators, if needed. (T-0) 11.2.1.4.  Pre-release counseling, including preparation of parole plans, if parole eligible. (T-0) 11.2.1.5.  Academic  Instruction.  Those  with  serious  reading  and/or  writing  deficiencies are offered the opportunity to pursue AF sponsored remedial training, if available locally. Adult basic education is designed to contribute to the inmates' social adjustment. (T-0) 11.2.1.6.  Religious  programs.  Confinees  are  permitted  to  worship  and  participate  in religious  activities  according  to  their  faiths,  subject  to  their  particular  custody requirements.  If  attending  worship  outside  the  facility  is  impractical  due  to  escort requirements,  work  with  the  base  chaplain’s  office  to  bring  ministry  to  the  facility. Confinees are not required to attend religious meetings or services. (T-0) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 113 11.3.  Training,  Treatment,  and  Transition  Program  (TTTP).  Confinement  staff  ensures AFSFC/SFC  TTTP  materials,  identified  in  the  TTTP  Resource  Guide,  are  made  available  to those who voluntarily elect to participate, even if housed off base. The TTTP Resource Guide is available https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/sfc-correctionsdivision.html TTTP is designed to provide information and resources for the Level I confinement  staff  to  better  assist  in  rehabilitation  and  successful  transition  back  to  the community. The confinement staff does not act as mental health counselors. (T-1) corrections the on website at 11.3.1.  Use  DD  Form  2712  to  document  weekly  progress  and  to  determine  eligibility  for Earned  Time  (ET).  Refer  to  DoDI  1325.07.,  Enclosure  2,  Appendix  3,  for  rates  and requirements. Confinement officers determine amount of ET awarded. (T-0) 11.3.1.1.  NOTE:  When  completing  the  DD  Form  2712  for  TTTP  evaluation,  the purpose is “other”. In Section 1, Attitude & Traits, complete “Initiative” and “Interest in Facility  Treatment  Program”  on  a  weekly  basis.  All  other  areas  pertain  to  the  inmate’s general  conduct  while  confined.  Section  2,  Work  Performance,  is  not  to  be  used  for TTTP  evaluation,  but  can  be  completed  for  participation  in  work  assignments  and combined with TTTP and general conduct evaluations. 11.4.  Education.  Encourage  further  civilian  and  military  education  by  allowing  base  level participation  in  self-study  courses  and  correspondence  courses,  as  practicable.  Successful completion  of  these  courses  counts  for  ET.  Refer  to  DoDI  1325.07.,  Enclosure  2,  Appendix  3, for rates and requirements. (T-0) 11.5.  Physical  Exercise  and  Recreation.  Historically,  the  majority  of  facility  disorders  are planned or instigated during extended periods of un-programmed time. It is with this in mind the facility  provides,  as  an  integral  part  of  the  correctional  treatment  program,  recreational  and welfare  activities  which  are  intended  to  constructively  occupy  time  and  fill  the  gaps  between scheduled  details,  training,  and  administrative  activities.  This  does  not  prohibit  schedules  from including free time; a full schedule should include free time. Recreation also helps relieve stress brought on by living in confinement. (T-0) 11.5.1.  Physical Exercise. Confinement officers ensure at least one hour of physical training, three times a week. For safety, security, and to prevent access to contraband, the staff closely supervises  team  sports  and  individual  activities.  Facilities  that  do  not  have  their  own recreation  yards  need  to  coordinate  with  the  services  commander  for  use  of  installation fitness  centers.  Ensure  adequate  escorts  are  available  according  to  custody  classifications. Only treadmills may be used for “running activities”. (T-0) including  an  organized 11.5.1.1.  NOTE:  Confinement  NCOs  should  consider calisthenics and cardio routine as part of a scheduled daily activities. Physical activity is an important stress relief in confinement and has shown to reduce disturbances and thus improves safety. 11.5.2.  Recreation.  Activities  are  effective  in  preventing  periods  of  idleness  and  boredom among  the  population.  Include  scheduled  periods  to  allow  for  reading,  table  games, television, and radio. Segregated confinees are allotted the same amount of recreation time as general population confinees. (T-0) 11.5.2.1.  NOTE:  Schedule  staggered  recreation  times  to  maintain  order  and  discipline within the facility. 114 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 11.5.3.  Dayroom  and  Television  Area.  Furnishings  should  be  comparable  to  those  in squadron dayrooms. Television and/or radios should be available. Provide tables and chairs for  table  games.  The  staff  monitors  television  or  radio  program  selection  to  limit violence/language/nudity. (T-0) 11.5.4.  Recreational  Reading  Area.  Screen/approve  reading  material  prior  to  facility introduction in order to prevent violence or nudity themed material. (T-0) 11.5.4.1.  NOTE:  Those in pay status are allowed to purchase approved reading material (i.e.,  hometown  newspaper,  local  newspaper,  or  magazines)  with  their  personal  funds. Reading  material  by  mail  must  arrive  from  the  publisher/supplier  (not  mailed  from  an individual) or be purchased directly from a vendor, such as the Base Exchange. AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 115 Chapter 12 CLEMENCY AND PAROLE 12.1.  Process.  As  per  DoDI  1325.07  and  DoDD  1325.04,  the  clemency  and  parole  process  is used  to  consider  eligible  inmates  for  clemency  (sentence  reduction)  or  community  supervision (parole  or  mandatory  supervised  release  (MSR)).  It  is  not  a  forum  for  inmates  to  appeal sentences or convictions. 12.2.  The  Disposition  Board.  As  necessary,  each  facility  establishes  a  disposition  board  to make  recommendations  for  confinee  clemency,  parole,  and  mandatory  supervised  release (MSR).  Parole,  clemency,  and  MSR  requests  are  forwarded  along  with  the  disposition  board’s recommendation  through  the  DFC  to  the  appropriate  Service  clemency  and  parole  board.  This three  member  board  is  historically  best  composed  of  those  above  the  chain  of  the  confinement staff,  but  still  close  enough  to  be  familiar  with  the  operations  of  the  mission  (e.g.,  consider Confinement Officer, SF Manager, SF Superintendents, etc.). To create consensus and fairness, the  DFC  may  use  the  Disposition  Board  to  review  and  recommend  changes  to  custody classifications,  work  and  quarters  assignments  and  treatment  program  or  training  assignments. NOTE: A Disposition Board is not the same as a D&A Bd (see paragraph 9.1.1. for D&A Bds). For  additional  information  on  disposition  board  procedures  concerning  clemency,  parole  and restoration matters see paragraphs 12.2 – 12.7. (T-0) 12.2.1.  Unless  the  board  is  waived  in  writing  by  the  inmate,  this  board  provides recommendations to the AFC&PB for: 12.2.2.  Clemency  in  the  form  of  suspension  or  remission  of  any  part/amount  of  the unexecuted  part  of  any  sentence,  including  all  uncollected  forfeitures  other  than  a  sentence approved by the President. (T-0) 12.2.3.  Parole, Restoration, or Return-to-Duty when requested by eligible inmates. (T-0) 12.2.4.  MSR. (T-0) 12.3.  Disposition  Board  Authority.  For  Level  I  Facilities,  the  confinement  officer  ensures  a disposition  board  convenes  for  clemency  and  parole  eligible  inmates.  For  Level  II  and  III Facilities, the facility boards and board procedures are administered through the facility’s Parole and Release Section. (T-0) 12.4.  Scheduling  Disposition  Boards.  Convene  disposition  boards  after  CA  action  however, time  restraints  may  require  convening  of  the  board  before  CA  action.  Schedule  disposition boards to ensure timely AFC&PB receipt of the recommendations. (T-1) 12.4.1.  The  AFC&PB  may  grant  or  disapprove  facility  or  inmate  requests  for  special consideration,  e.g.,  earlier  or  out-of-cycle  consideration.  Cases  given  out-of-cycle consideration do not affect an inmate’s annual consideration date. 12.5.  Disposition  Board  Case  File  Preparation  at  AF  Level  I  Confinement  Facilities.  The confinement  officer  or  NCO  assist  eligible  inmates  in  preparing  their  package  (e.g.,  providing paper,  addresses,  access  to  ADC,  if  requested,  etc.)  unless  eligibility  is  specifically  waived  or postponed by the inmate in writing. The following items are forwarded to the AFC&PB: 116 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 12.5.1.  Disposition board recommendations. Submit in typewritten form, including rationale for both majority and minority recommendations. (T-1) 12.5.2.  Inmate  Disposition  Board  Brief.  Contains  pertinent  information  about  the  inmate's court-martial, background and confinement data. (T-1) For example: name, age, nature of the offenses, sentence, date sentenced, pretrial confinement (if any), parent unit name, summary of behavior and rehabilitation effort, discipline and any other factors deemed appropriate. 12.5.3.  Inmate's parole, clemency and restoration request/statement. (T-1) 12.5.4.  Inmate's personal letter (optional). (T-1) 12.5.5.  Inmate's Tender of Residence Statement. (T-1) 12.5.6.

If  victim  impact  statements  were  submitted,  ensure  attachment  and  inclusion  in the disposition board case file. (T-0) inmate’s 12.6.  Disposition  Board  Considerations.  A  disposition  board  considers offense(s),  attitude,  aptitude,  adaptability  to  confinement,  record  of  performance  during confinement,  rehabilitation  efforts,  rehabilitation  potential  and  potential  for  further  military service  or  adjustment  to  the  civilian  life.  Disposition  Board  proceedings  are  not  open  to  the public,  victims,  or  witnesses. for approval/disapproval of parole, MSR, clemency, or restoration to duty, consider the following as applicable: recommendation (T-0)  When the formulating a 12.6.1.

Disposition  Board  Procedures  at  AF  Level  I  Confinement  Facilities.  Confinement staff  and  other  officials  may  not  release  recommendations  to  inmates.  The  following  is  the sequence  of  events  for  a  disposition  board  at  AF  facilities.  NOTE:  See  paragraph  9.1.2.  for board composition. (T-1) 12.7.1.  The disposition is held no earlier than 60 days and no later than 30 days before the inmate’s parole eligibility date. (T-1) 12.7.2.  The board members review the inmate’s case file (available for review at the facility) at  least  24-hours  prior  to  the  board  meeting.  The  board  members  review  the  package  and formulate their questions for the inmate prior to the board. (T-1) 12.7.3.  The chairperson convenes the board. The inmate reports to the chairperson and either requests or declines any  of the following:  parole, clemency,  and/or restoration to  duty. The inmate is  allowed to  present  documentation. Questions from  the board are to  be relevant  to the  inmate's  request.  After  questioning  is  completed,  the  chairperson  allows  the  inmate  an opportunity to make a closing statement for the board’s consideration. (T-1) 12.7.3.1.  NOTE:  Additional  information  on  best  practices  can  be  obtained  by contacting AFSFC/SFC. 12.7.4.  The  board  votes  and  makes  the  results  available  for  the  DFC  to  provide  comments (the  vote  is  not  provided  to  the  inmate).  The  DFC  cannot  alter  the  vote  and  only  provides comments  for  the  AFC&PB’s  consideration.  The  results  and  documents  provided  by  the inmate, including an inmate’s written waiver if the proceeding is declined, are processed and electronically  forwarded  to  the  AFC&PB  email  org  box  address;  usaf.pentagon.saf-mr.mbx.saf-mrbp-cpb@mail.mil  for  review  and  action.  Additionally,  forward  a  courtesy copy of the complete board package via mail or email to the inmate’s CA via the SJA. (T-1) 12.8.  Facility  Disposition  Boards  at  DoD  Level  II  and  III  Corrections  Facilities.  Through DoDIs  and  Inter-Service  Support  Agreements  the  Level  II  or  III  facilities  convene  disposition boards for eligible AF inmates and forward results directly to the AFC&PB for final disposition. The AFC&PB sends a copy of the results to both the facility commander and AFSFC/SFC. 12.9.  Air  Force  Clemency  and  Parole  Board.  The  AFC&PB  makes  decisions  on  clemency, reenlistment  eligibility,  transfer  to  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons  (FBOP),  parole,  MSR, restoration and Return-to-Duty on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force. 118 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 12.9.1.  The  Director,  Air  Force  Review  Boards  Agency  appoints  members  to  the  board  on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force. The AFC&PB meets at the direction of the Chair of the AFC&PB. As a minimum, the board consists of the Director of the Secretary of the Air Force  Personnel  Council  (SAFPC),  a  representative  from  AFLOA/JAJR, a  Judge  Advocate representative  assigned  to  Air  Force  Review  Boards  Agency,  a  representative  from AFSFC/SFC  and  the  Chair.  The  Executive  Secretary  of  the  AFC&PB  is  the  Chair.  The Deputy Director of the SAFPC serves on the board in the absence of the Director of SAFPC; and the Deputy  Executive Secretary of the AFC&PB serves on the board in  the absence of the Chair of the AFC&PB. 12.9.2.  The AFC&PB Chair or Deputy Executive Secretary authenticates the official entries into Department of the Air Force records and provides written notice of approved actions as necessary. 12.9.3.  The AFC&PB Chair or Deputy Executive Secretary maintains liaison with the Judge Advocate  General  of  the  Air  Force,  Director  of  Security  Forces,  the  Departments  of  the Army  and  Navy  C&PBs,  the  FBOP,  the  US  Parole  Commission  and  the  Administrative Office of the US District Courts. 12.9.4.  The  AFC&PB  executes  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force’s  clemency  authority established under Title 10 USC § 953. The board may suspend or remit all or any part of an unexecuted  sentence  under  Article  74(a)  of  the  UCMJ,  including  changing  a  dishonorable discharge to a bad conduct discharge. There is no right of appeal from a clemency decision of the  Board.  Upon  favorable  consideration  of  a  RTD  application  by  the  AFC&PB,  the discharge  is  upgraded  to  honorable  to  allow  reenlistment,  or  to  general  under  honorable conditions, without reenlistment eligibility. (See Attachment 18) 12.9.5.  The  AFC&PB  considers  eligible  inmates,  to  include  those  in  federal  and  state facilities, to: 12.9.5.1.  Adjust  significant  disparities  in  approved  sentences,  to  affect  uniformity  for similar offenses and similar offenders, as far as possible and otherwise modify approved sentences  consistent  with  good  order  and  discipline  and  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Air Force, society and the inmate. 12.9.5.2.  Release eligible inmates in military corrections facilities to parole or MSR. 12.9.5.3.  Determine reenlistment eligibility (Title 10 USC §§ 951, 953 and 954). 12.9.5.4.  Recommend  to  the  Secretary  substitution  of  an  administrative  discharge  for  a punitive discharge or dismissal under Article 74(b), UCMJ. 12.9.5.5.  Approve transfer of inmates to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP). 12.9.6.  AFC&PB  proceedings  are  not  open  to  the  public.  Although  individuals  being considered  by  the  AFC&PB  are  not  authorized  to  make  a  personal  appearance  before  the Board, the Board considers any written, audio, or video material sent by or on behalf of the inmate. Others, such as family members, friends, professional associates or attorneys, may at no  expense  to  the  Government,  appear  on  behalf  of  an  individual  being  considered  for clemency or parole. Additionally, victims, the victim’s family and representatives may also appear at no expense to the Government, to present information concerning the impact of the confining  offenses  on  the  victim  or  the  victim’s  family.  The  AFC&PB  retains  absolute AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 119 authority to determine who may be permitted to appear, to limit the time of any presentation before the AFC&PB,  and to  ensure the orderly nature of the  proceedings. Additionally, the Board  considers  any  written,  audio,  or  video  material  sent  by  or  on  behalf  of  victims, witnesses and other interested individuals. 12.9.7.  The  Chair  or  any  other  authorized  representative  of  the  AFC&PB  may  initiate discussions  and  correspondence  with  inmates,  victims  and  individuals  in  law  enforcement, the correctional institutions, or probation and parole fields to assist the Board in carrying out its responsibilities. 12.9.8.  The AFC&PB develops and recommends uniform policies with respect to clemency, parole,  and  MSR.  These  policies  become  effective  when  implemented  by  the  Chair  or designee. 12.10.  Clemency and Parole/Mandatory Supervised Release (MSR) Considerations.  Along with recommendations from the disposition board, AFSFC/SFC, confinement/corrections facility commanders and the appropriate CA, the AFC&PB considers the following for clemency, parole and Mandatory Supervised Release (MSR): 12.10.1.  Nature, circumstance and impact of offense(s) on the victim(s). (T-0) 12.10.2.  Inmate's military, civilian and confinement records, including custody level attained and participation in rehabilitation programs. (T-0) 12.10.3.  Inmate's  personal  characteristics  (age,  education,  civilian,  personal  support  system and psychological profile). (T-0) 12.10.4.  Protection and welfare of society. (T-0) 12.10.5.  The need for good order and discipline and deterrent effect of a decision. (T-0) 12.10.6.  Inmate's combat and/or overseas records. (T-0) 12.10.7.  Inmate's  insight  into  wrongfulness  of  offense(s)  and  demonstrated  sense  of responsibility. (T-0) 12.10.8.  The feasibility of a proposed supervised release plan. (T-0) 12.10.9.  Inmate's efforts to make restitution to the victim. (T-0) 12.11.  Eligibility  for  Clemency  (Sentence  Reduction,  Restoration,  Reenlistment  and/or Return-to-Duty).  After CA action, upon request, the AFC&PB may consider clemency actions for inmates and former inmates still under parole or supervision. (T-0) 12.11.1.  The  AFC&PB  considers  clemency,  restoration  and  reenlistment  actions  according to standards and procedures in DoDI 1325.07. (See Attachment 18) 12.11.2.  The AFC&PB considers out-of-cycle clemency requests, for cause. 12.11.3.  Those  inmates  sentenced  to  death  do  not  have  their  cases  reviewed  by  the AFC&PB. 12.12.  Announcement of Clemency Results.  Confinement officers promptly notify inmates of the AFC&PB’s decision. The confinement officer notifies the Board immediately if an inmate’s conduct  has  significantly  changed,  or  if  there  is  other  relevant  information  the  Board  should consider. (T-0) 120 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 12.13.  Eligibility  for  Parole.  Unless  waived  in  writing,  the  AFC&PB  considers  inmates  for release  on  parole  when  they  first  become  eligible  and  annually  thereafter.  The  Board  or  a confinement/corrections  facility  commander  may  advance  an  inmate’s  parole  eligibility  date  or order an out-of-cycle disposition board. Inmates may make special requests for advancement of parole  eligibility  or  an  out-of-cycle  disposition  board  to  the  confinement/corrections  facility commander. (T-0) 12.13.1.  Unless directed otherwise by the AFC&PB, inmates are eligible for parole when the inmate  has  an  approved  unsuspended  sentence,  1)  to  a  punitive  discharge  or  dismissal,  an approved administrative discharge, or is either retired or approved for retirement and 2) the unsuspended  sentence  or  aggregate  sentence  to  confinement  is  12  months  or  more  and  the inmate has served one-third of the term of confinement, but in no case less than 6 months; or after  having  served  10  years  of  a  sentence  to  confinement  for  30  years  or  more,  or  after having  served  20  years  of  a  sentence  to  confinement  for  life,  but  not  a  sentence  of confinement for life without eligibility for parole. 12.13.2.  The  AFC&PB  normally  does  not  consider  inmates  whose  parole  was  revoked  for parole violations and returned to confinement until the inmate serves 12-months confinement after return to confinement. 12.13.3.  An  inmate  with  an  approved  sentence  to  death  or  confinement  for  life  without eligibility for parole is not eligible for parole. 12.13.4.  The AFC&PB considers inmates, if otherwise eligible for parole in accordance with paragraph 12.13.1., with an approved sentence including confinement for 12 months or more and a fine with a provision for further confinement if the fine is not paid, for parole based on the  approved  sentence  to  confinement  and  without  regard  to  that  confinement  made contingent upon failure to pay the fine. 12.13.5.  The  AFC&PB  considers  inmates  with  an  approved  sentence  including  a  fine  with no confinement, but with a provision for confinement if the fine is not paid, for parole upon the inmate’s imprisonment for not paying the fine, if otherwise eligible, in accordance with paragraph 12.13.1. 12.13.6.  When computing eligibility for parole date, do not factor GCT and ET. 12.13.7.  The  AFC&PB  can  waive  any  of  the  above  eligibility  requirements,  except  those relating to inmates with  an approved sentence to confinement for life without eligibility for parole or with an approved sentence to death. 12.14.  Objectives of Parole.  The objectives of parole are: 12.14.1.  Assisting  the  inmate  through  supervision  and  guidance  in  making  the  transition from a controlled environment to life in the community. 12.14.2.  Making  available a focal  point through  which community services may contribute to the inmate’s positive social adjustment. 12.14.3.  Protecting unsupervised release. the  community  and the inmate  from  stresses  associated  with AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 121 12.15.  Parole/Mandatory Supervised  Release  (MSR)  Preparation Assistance.  Confinement officers appoint an individual to provide the following assistance to inmates. The appointee must have no direct connection with the individual inmate’s prosecution. (T-0) 12.15.1.  The appointee advises inmate of requirements and eligibility criteria for parole and MSR.  The  appointee  assists  them  in  developing  an  acceptable  supervision  plan  (either  a parole  plan  or  an  inmate’s  plan  for  MSR)  and  if  applicable  a  restitution  plan.  Lastly,  upon completion of the plan, the appointee verifies the inmate’s plans. (T-0) 12.15.2.  The  appointee  interviews  inmate  and  formulates  a  recommendation  to  the disposition  board  on  DD  Form  2715-1.  The  recommendation  is  based  on  the  merits  of  the inmate’s  parole  plan  and  suitability  for  parole.  The  appointee  recommends  any  specific conditions  for  parole;  e.g.,  involvement  in  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  or  Narcotics Anonymous  (NA)  sessions,  community-based  behavioral  health  or  substance  abuse rehabilitation programs and urinalysis testing. (T-0) 12.15.3.  Once  parole  is  approved,  the  appointee  contacts  the  Parole  Branch  at  the  MCF  to determine the US Probation Office nearest the inmate’s residence while on parole. (T-0) 12.15.3.1.  The  appointee  contacts  designated  US  Probation  Office  to  relinquish responsibility of the inmate. (T-0) 12.15.3.2.  The appointee forwards a copy of inmate’s supervision plan and parole/MSR certificate  with  attachments  to  the  designated  US  Probation  Office  to  coordinate  an inmate’s supervision plan. (T-0) 12.16.  Conditions  for  Release  on  Parole/MSR.  The  AFC&PB  paroles  inmates  when  it  is consistent  with  the  ends  of  justice  and  as  soon  as  inmates  demonstrate  they  can  assume  the responsibilities  of  productive,  law-abiding  citizens.  Parole  is  not  a  means  to  manage  inmate populations.  Prior  to  release  on  parole,  inmates  must  have  an  approved  supervision  plan  and agree in writing to abide by the plan and the conditions of supervision. 12.16.1.  The  inmate’s  plan  includes  where  and  with  whom  the  inmate  will  live. Additionally, it includes the full address, county or parish, telephone number and relationship of  and  written  acknowledgment  by  the  person  with  whom  the  parolee  will  live.  The  plan must include the names and relationships of all residents in the household and birth dates of all residents under the age of 18. 12.16.2.  Ensure the plan includes employment information except in the case of a medically disabled inmate. The inmate can meet this requirement by presenting written proof of  either guaranteed employment, an offer of effective assistance to obtain employment, or acceptance to  a  bona  fide  educational  or  vocational  program.  Employment  in  a  family  member’s household  or  an  offer  of  employment  assistance  by  a  family  member  is  normally  not acceptable. 12.16.3.  If  the  inmate’s  crime  involved  pecuniary  (financial)  loss  by  a  victim  consider including appropriate restitution guidance in the supervision plan. 12.16.4.  The  AFC&PB  establishes  and  subsequently  modifies  any  conditions  for  release  it considers reasonable and appropriate. The Board may also  grant parole up to the expiration of full sentence. 122 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 12.17.  Announcement  of Parole  Results.  The AFC&PB immediately forwards its decision to the  commander  of  the  facility  housing  the  inmate.  The  commander  ensures  the  inmate acknowledges  the  appropriate  section  (i.e.,  parole  approval  or  parole  denial)  and  signs  the  DD Form  2716,  Parole  Acknowledgement  Letter.  When  the  Board  denies  parole,  its  decision includes the reason for denial. When the Board  approves parole, the decision  package includes the DD Form 2716-1, Department of Defense Certificate of Supervised Release. Before notifying the inmate of the results, the confinement officer notifies the Board immediately if the inmate’s conduct  significantly  changed  or  there  is  other  relevant  information  that  the  Board  should consider. 12.18.  Appeal  of  Parole  Denial.  Inmates  denied  parole  may  appeal  through  the  facility commander  or  designee  within  30  days  of  receiving  written  notification  of  denial.  The  inmate should submit new or additional information not previously considered. The facility commander or  designee  verifies  the  accuracy  of  inmate’s  statement  and  provides  input  as  to  whether  the factors  justify  changing  the  AFC&PB's  decision.  The  facility  commander  or  designee electronically  forwards  the  inmate’s  appeal  and  the  board  case  file  to:  usaf.pentagon.saf-mr.mbx.saf-mrbp-cpb@mail.mil for final  decision  by the Director,  Air Force Review Boards Agency. Inmates receive no further appeals. 12.19.  Parole  Processing.  The confinement officer or facility  commander releases inmates on parole, in coordination with appropriate US Probation Office, as specified on DD Form 2716-1. Inmate  misconduct  after  parole  approval  may  delay  or  preclude  release.  Promptly  notify  the AFC&PB of the reason for delay and make a recommendation for further delays or rescission of parole, if necessary. (T-0) 12.19.1.  Upon  approval  of  parole,  the  Chair  or  designee  prepares  DD  Form  2716-1,  and forwards  it  with  the  notification  of  parole  approval,  to  the  confinement  officer  having custody of the inmate. (T-0) 12.19.2.  Confinement  officers  responsible  for  Level  I  facilities  notify  AFSFC/SFC  on pending parole releases to ensure proper coordination is completed including Victim/Witness notifications. (T-0) 12.19.2.1.  The inmate signs all copies of the parole certificate acknowledging receipt and understanding  of  the  contents.  The  certificate,  which  serves  as  a  release  order,  also contains any special conditions or limits to parole. (T-0) 12.19.2.2.  The confinement/corrections facility distributes the original DD Form 2716-1 to the USDB Parole Office, the first copy to the inmate, the second copy to the designated US Probation Officer, the third copy to the AFC&PB and the fourth is placed in the CTF. (T-0) 12.19.3.  If discharge is complete, the confinement officer gives AF Form 100 and DD Form 214 to the inmate before release on parole. (T-0) 12.19.4.  Inmates  released  on  parole,  if  qualified,  receive  the  same  gratuities  as  inmates released from confinement. (T-0) 12.19.5.  A medical practitioner gives parolees a physical examination according to AFI 48-123,  Medical  Examination  and  Medical  Standards.  This  physical  examination  suffices  for AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 123 the  discharge  physical  for  those  inmates  undergoing  appellate  review  and  not  previously discharged. (T-0) 12.19.6.  Individuals released on parole are directly responsible to the assigned US Probation Officer and to the AFC&PB. (T-0) 12.19.7.  The  parolee  may  not  travel  outside  the  parole  limits  without  prior  approval.  The parole  limits  include  the  geographical  areas  in  which  an  inmate  resides.  Unless  otherwise directed  by  the  AFC&PB,  the  parolee's  movement  is  to  be  prescribed  by  the  probation officer, who may extend or further restrict the parole limits as required for the adjustment and supervision of the parolee. However, the parolee must obtain prior approval of the AFC&PB, through the probation officer, for an absence from the parole limits for more than 20 days or for any travel outside of the United States. The probation officer should advise the AFC&PB of any such requests. 12.19.8.  Upon  receipt  of  AFP&PB’s  parole  approval,  the  confinement  staff  contacts inmate’s  servicing  FSS  (if  not  gained  by  AFSFC/SFC)  and  provides  a  copy  of  the  letter approving parole. AFSFC/SFC provides specific actions for completing PCS orders and for releasing the inmate. The prepared DD Form 2716-1 serves as the release order. NOTE: Do Not complete DD Form 2718, Prisoner Release Order. (T-0) 12.19.8.1.  Ensure  all  VWAP  and  Sex  Offender  notifications/registration,  if  applicable, have been made prior to release. (T-0) 12.19.8.2.  Consult  AFSFC/SFCP  to  determine  parolee  eligibility  to  be  reassigned  to AFSFC/SFC. (T-0) 12.19.8.3.  The AFC&PB considers parolees for clemency. The clemency review package must include the assigned US Probation Officer’s report on the parolee’s adjustment. (T-0) 12.20.  Parole Termination.  Expiration of the term of confinement ends parole. 12.20.1.  If  a  parolee's  punitive  discharge  has  been  executed  or  the  parolee  is  eligible  and approved to retire at the end of the parolee’s service of confinement, then at the completion of the full term of confinement, the parolee is released from supervision. 12.20.2.  If a parolee’s sentence to confinement  expires before appellate review is  complete and before execution of  a discharge or retirement,  the parolee is  placed on excess  leave by the servicing FSS. (T-0) 12.21.  Parole Suspension.  When the AFC&PB receives information that the parolee may have violated one or more conditions of parole, the Board Chair, or designee, immediately determines whether  to  suspend  parole.  If  also  considered  necessary  to  assure  the  presence  of  the  parolee, pending  a  determination  of  the  parolee’s  status,  or  when  the  parolee  presents  a  flight  risk  or substantial  threat  to  public  safety,  the  Chair  or  designee  may  direct  the  parolee  be  taken  into custody.  The  Chair  or  designee  advises  the  AFC&PB  of  the  action  taken  as  soon  as  possible. Transportation  costs  incident  to  return  to  military  custody  under  these  conditions  are  borne  by the government. (T-0) 12.22.  Parole  Revocation  (Parole  Violation  Warrants).  The  AFC&PB,  revokes  parole according to standards and procedures in DoDI 1325.07. 124 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 12.22.1.  The  AFC&PB  consider  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  officer  or  panel conducting  the  parole  violation  hearing.  The  AFC&PB  makes  a  decision  to  revoke  parole based  on  the  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  the  parolee  violated  a  condition  of  parole and  that  the  violation  warrants  parole  revocation.  In  determining  whether  the  violation warrants the revocation of parole, the Board should consider the factors set forth in paragraph 12.10. as well as the impact  the revocation creates on the parolee and the parolee’s family. (T-0) 12.22.2.  After  conducting  a  supervision  violation  hearing  (SVH),  the  officer  or  panel immediately  forwards  a  summary  of  the  proceedings  to  the  AFC&PB.  If  the  AFC&PB revokes parole and does not immediately re-parole the parolee and the parolee is confined in a  civilian  institution,  the  AFC&PB  initiates  action  to  lodge  a  detainer  with  civilian authorities.  If  the  parolee  is  at  large  in  the  district  of  the  violation,  pending  decision  on revocation, the AFC&PB initiates action to return the parolee to military control. (T-0) 12.22.3.  When the AFC&PB suspends or revokes parole, the AFC&PB may order a warrant for the parolee’s return to military custody. The AFC&PB furnishes a copy of its decision to order a warrant to AFSFC/SFC so a warrant may be prepared for the AFSFC/CC’s signature. AFSFC/SFC  completes  DD  Form  553-1,  Parole/Mandatory  Supervised  Release  (MSR) Violator Wanted by the Armed Forces. The warrant is entered into NCIC. In cases of parole revocation,  AFC&PB  furnishes  an  information  copy  to  AFLOA/JAJM.  When  a  parole violator is located in the custody of civil authorities, AFSFC/SFC places a detainer with civil authorities  for  return  of  the  inmate  to  military  control.  The  nearest  Air  Force  Installation Security  Forces  unit,  as  determined  by  AFSFC/SFC,  is  responsible  for  returning  AF  parole violators  to  military  control.  AFSFC/SFC  arranges  subsequent  movement(s)  for  the completion  of  any  remaining  period  of  confinement.  For  the  purposes  of  return  to  military custody  AF  parole  violators,  including  violators  on  Mandatory  Supervised  Release,  are considered  deserters.  NOTE:  See  paragraph  8.8.3.  for  additional  information  on  return  of absentees, deserters, and escapees. (T-1) 12.22.3.1.  AFSFC/SFC also completes FBI Form I-12 (as necessary) on a parolee whose apprehension is desired. Check the “wanted for” box and give the reason for the notice. Completing the form does not mean the FBI moves to initiate an arrest. It merely notifies AFSFC/SFC of arrests coming to the attention of the FBI Identification Division. 12.22.3.2.  Upon  return  to  military  custody,  the  AFSFC/SFC  cancels  the  NCIC  warrant by completing DD Form 616 and ensuring cancellation of active warrant. If FBI Form I-12 was completed, the “Wanted” notice is cancelled by completing the applicable portion and submitting it to HQ AFOSI for submission to the FBI. 12.22.3.3.  AFSFC/SFC  secures  the  fund  site  for  returning  parole  violators  to  military custody.  The  facility  returned  is  normally  the  facility  which  released  on  parole/MSR. AFSFC/SFC  directs/coordinates  with  appropriate  military/civilian  agencies  to  affect  the return. 12.22.3.4.  At  AFSFC/SFC’s  direction,  the  nearest  Air  Force  installation  security  forces provides  escorts  for  return  of  the  parole/MSR  violator  to  military  control.  For  this purpose, parole/MSR violators are considered in escape status. (T-1) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 125 12.23.  Emergency  Parole  (EP)  .  DFCs may  authorize, in  consultation  with  their SJA, EP for inmates  who  require  a  home  visit  for  extreme  emergency  circumstances.  The  death(s)  of  an inmate’s family member(s), or the birth of a child(ren), for example, are not normally considered extreme  circumstances.  An  extreme  emergency  circumstance  is  normally  one  in  which  the inmate’s  physical  presence  is  deemed  necessary  to  save  the  life  of  another,  e.g.,  an  organ donation/bone marrow donation. Verify the emergency with agencies such as the American Red Cross,  or  by  direct  consultation  with  medical  professionals  requesting  the  inmate’s  presence. Prior  determination  must  be  made  to  verify  circumstances  exist  that  justify  such  special  action and  that  such  action  is  consistent  with  correctional  requirements  and  public  safety.  Ensure security  is  maintained  when  the  inmate  is  hospitalized  overnight  following  a  medical  donation procedure.  If  a  non-hospitalized  overnight  stay  is  required,  the  inmate  may  only  reside  in  a military confinement  facility or  an approved civilian facility (see paragraph 1.2.2.1. for facility approval).  Due  to  the  urgent  nature  of  EP  make  initial  victim/witness  notification(s) telephonically followed up by the usual written notification(s). DFCs authorize EP for as long as deemed necessary, but normally should not exceed seven days or a period considered medically necessary.  Time  on  EP  counts  as  confinement  time  served.  Unless  the  sentence  expires  during EP, inmates return to confinement. The US Government must not incur financial responsibility for  any  inmate  expenses  during  an  EP  situation  unless  it  is  lifesaving  in  nature,  otherwise  all travel and subsistence expenses of the inmate and escorts (escort number determined by custody classification)  is  borne  by  the  inmate.  For  life  saving  instances,  the  inmates’  parent  unit  is responsible for funding. (T-1) 12.23.1.  NOTE:  If a similar situation exists for a pretrial detainee, consult with the SJA and the  commander  who  ordered  pretrial  confinement.  Since  a  detainee  is  not  adjudicated  a decision is necessary to either release from pretrial confinement or conduct an escort mission under maximum custody guidelines. 12.24.  Mandatory  Supervised  Release  (MSR)  Eligibility.  Mandatory  supervision  applies  to inmates  not  approved  for  parole,  and  whose  approved  finding  of  guilty  included  at  least  one offense that occurred on or after August 17, 2001. The AFC&PB normally places the following inmates, who are not paroled, under MSR on their minimum release dates: an inmate convicted of  a  violent  offense  or  a  sex  offense  (see  sex  offense  list  at  Appendix  4  to  Enclosure  2,  DoDI 1325.07), an inmate with an approved sentence to  confinement of 3  years or greater, and other inmates  deemed  appropriate  for  mandatory  supervision  by  the  confinement/corrections  facility commander  and  the  AFC&PB.  There  is  no  right  of  appeal  of  the  AFC&PB’s  MSR  decision. However,  inmates  who  have  been  notified  of  their  selection  for  MSR  may  request,  in  writing, that  the  AFC&PB  reconsider  the  MSR  decision  or  modify  the  conditions  of  MSR  through  the Military  Confinement  Facility  commander  to  the  AFC&PB  within  30  calendar  days  of notification  of  the  selection.  Inmates  placed  on  MSR  are  deemed  to  be  on  parole  until  the expiration  of  their  sentence  to  confinement.  The  AFC&PB  provides  corrections  staff  with guidance  on  implementing  the  procedures  detailed  in  DoDI  1325.07.  The  AFC&PB  considers inmates released on MSR for clemency 12 months after release and annually thereafter until the sentence expires.  JOHN B.

Maintain liaison with USACIL. A7.1.1.2.  Maintain  copies  of  all  AF  initial  promulgating  (court-martial)  orders containing  an annotation that DNA processing is  required,  regardless  of  where or if the member is confined. A7.1.1.3.  When  requested,  assist  USACIL  in  reconciling  why  a  DNA  sample  for  a particular AF member has not  been received at  the lab for analysis (i.e., in  cases where USACIL has received an annotated initial promulgating order reflecting conviction of a "qualifying military offense" but no corresponding sample). This includes contacting the facility  at  which  the  member  is  confined  and  ascertaining  the  status  of  the  DNA collection  requirement.  If  the  member  is  not  in  confinement  at  the  time  the  request  is received,  this  will  require  contacting  the  CA's  staff  judge  advocate  for  assistance  in ascertaining the status of the DNA collection requirement. A7.1.2.  Air Force Correctional Facility Responsibilities: A7.1.2.1.  Contact  USACIL  at  DSN  797-7258  or  COMM  (404)  469-7258  or  email  at usarmy.gillem.dfsc.mbx.codis@mail.mil  using  your  confinement  organizational  email account to obtain kits. A7.1.2.2.  Determine if any inmates confined at their facilities on or after 19 June 2001, regardless  of service affiliation, have a conviction of a "qualifying military offense" for which initial action has been taken by the convening authority. Ascertain the existence of a "qualifying military offense" by examining the initial court-martial promulgating orders published  for  each  inmate.  DNA  samples  are  not  collected  upon  conviction  of  a qualifying offense, but upon CA action approving the member’s sentence. A7.1.2.2.1.  Promulgating orders published  on and after 19 Jun 2001 (IAW AFI 51-201)  are  annotated  in  bold  print  at  the  top  of  the  first  page  if  the  inmate  has  been convicted  of  a  qualifying  military  offense:  "DNA  Processing  Required.  10  USC. §1565 and 42 USC §14135a". A7.1.2.2.2.  Promulgating  orders  published  prior  to  19  Jun  2001  will  not  be annotated. When in doubt, consult with your local SJA. A7.1.2.3.  For each inmate identified with a conviction of a "qualifying military offense," ensure a DNA sample is promptly collected and sent to USACIL. Confirm with AFOSI and  SFS/SFI  that  a  sample  was  collected.  If  not,  use  USACIL  DNA  collection  kits, including  the  instructions  contained  in  these  kits,  for  processing  DNA  collection.  If  an inmate  refuses  to  cooperate  in  providing  a  DNA  sample,  contact  AFSFC/SFC  for guidance. A7.1.2.4.  Document DNA processing in each inmate's confinement records. If an inmate is subsequently transferred to another correctional facility after a DNA sample has been sent to USACIL, ensure paperwork reflecting DNA processing is included with the other AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 155 documentation provided to the gaining correctional facility. If the inmate is transferred to another  correctional  facility  before  a  required  DNA  sample  can  be  obtained,  notify  the receiving  facility  that  DNA  processing  requirements  must  still  be  accomplished  for  the transferred inmate. A7.1.2.5.  If  an  inmate  must  be  released  from  confinement  before  collection  of  a  DNA sample  is  possible  (i.e.,  USACIL  kits  are  unavailable),  immediately  notify  SJA  of  the CA.  The  SJA  will  notify  appropriate  agencies  to  ensure  DNA  processing  is accomplished. A7.1.2.6.  Monitor  kit  expiration  dates.  When  supplies  are  low,  request  additional  kits from USACIL. A7.1.2.7.  When members did not receive confinement or are no longer in confinement, provide full assistance to commanders who are responsible for ensuring a DNA sample is collected,  when  the  initial  promulgating  order  is  published.  Assist  such  commanders regardless  of  service  affiliation.  This  includes  completing  items  1-6  and  8  on  the USACIL  collection  card,  witnessing  local  medical  personnel  draw  the  blood,  and complete  item  7  on  the  USACIL  collection  card  and  mailing  the  DNA  sample  to USACIL. A7.1.2.7.1.  For installations that do not operate a correctional facility, SF personnel should  assist  local  commanders  in  fulfilling  their  DNA  processing  responsibilities, including assistance as described in paragraph A7.1.2.7 above. A7.1.2.7.2.  Coordinate with SJA and owning commanders to develop procedures to deal  with  inmates  on  appellate  leave  who  refused  to  comply  with  requirements following notification.  156 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 Attachment 8 SAMPLE - PERSONAL DEPOSIT FUND ACTIVITY REPORT Figure A8.1.

Provide correctional facilities guidelines for the marriages of confinees. The DFC shall approve a confinee's request to marry except where a legal restriction to the marriage exists, or where the proposed marriage presents a threat to the security or good order  of  the  facility,  or  to  the  protection  of  the  public.  The  DFC  may  approve  the  use  of  the facility for the marriage ceremony. If a marriage ceremony poses a threat to the security or good order  of  the  facility,  the  DFC  may  disapprove  a  marriage  ceremony  in  the  facility  after coordination/guidance from the SJA for an alternate means (i.e., most states recognize a marriage ceremony performed over speaker phones or a proxy marriage via  affidavit of absent  applicant for  marriage  license).  Any  decision  to  disapprove  a  request  to  marry  must  first  be  coordinated with the SJA. A10.2.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVE. The expected result of this program: Confinee marriages will be  requested,  approved,  and  conducted  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws,  rules,  and regulations. A10.3.  PROCEDURES. Procedures specified in this Program Statement apply to all AF pretrial detainees and post-trial inmates. A10.4.  AUTHORITY TO APPROVE A MARRIAGE. The DFC may approve the marriage of confinees in an AF facility. This authority may not be delegated below the level of Acting DFC. A10.5.  ELIGIBILITY TO MARRY. A confinee's request to marry shall be approved provided: A10.5.1.  The confinee and intended spouse are legally eligible to marry. If overseas, check Host Nation requirements. A10.5.2.  The confinee is mentally competent; A10.5.3.  The  intended  spouse  has  verified,  ordinarily  in  writing,  an  intention  to  marry  the confinee; and A10.5.4.  The marriage poses no threat to facility security or good order, or to the protection of  the  public.  Staff    reviews  the  marriage  request  to  ensure  it  is  not  made  to  circumvent existing visiting policy, thereby posing a threat to facility security or good order. A10.6.  APPLICATION TO MARRY. A10.6.1.  A  confinee  in  an  AF  confinement/corrections  facility  who  wants  to  get  married submits a DD Form 510, to the confinement NCO. Requirements vary by facility according to country (international) or State law. Obtain the requirements from nearest city courthouse or  foreign  consulate.  The  confinement  NCO  evaluates  the  request  based  upon  the  criteria identified in paragraph A10.7. The confinement NCO submits a written report of the findings and  makes  a  recommendation  to  the  DFC  for  a  final  decision.  Seek  SJA  assistance  as necessary. The intended spouse must obtain needed documents. A10.6.1.1.  Information on the confinee's legal eligibility to marry is determined through conversation  with  the  confinee  and  by  reviewing  the  Correction  Treatment  File  (CTF). Indication  of  a  present  or  prior  marriage,  including  a  common-law  marriage,  requires written  verification  that  the  marriage  is  legally  dissolved.  The  status  of  a  common-law AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 159 marriage  and  its  dissolution,  are  determined  under  the  law.  Refer  questions  on  a confinee's legal eligibility to marry to the SJA. A10.6.1.2.  Information  on  a  confinee's  mental  competence  may  be  obtained  by reviewing  behavioral  health  reports  prepared  on  the  confinee  prior  to  and/or  during  the present  period  of  confinement.  A  mental  competency  examination  should  not  be conducted specifically to determine the confinee's mental competence to marry. A10.6.1.3.  The  confinement  NCO  should  contact  and  request  a  written  statement  from the intended spouse, to  verify that party's interest in marrying. An intended spouse who requests  additional  information  about  the  confinee  from  the  confinement  NCO  is  to  be advised to discuss these issues with the confinee, or, if preferred, to write the ADC. A10.6.1.4.  The confinement NCO assesses whether the marriage poses a threat to facility security  or  good  order,  or  to  public  protection.  As  part  of  the  review,  the  confinement NCO consults with the confinement officer for their assessment. A10.6.2.  The DFC notifies the confinee in writing whether the confinee's request to marry is approved or disapproved. Place a copy of this notification  in the confinee's CTF. When the DFCs  decision  is  to  disapprove  the  confinee's  request,  the  notification  to  the  confinee includes a statement of reason(s) for that action. The DFC also advises the confinee that the decision may be appealed to the installation commander, who will have final authority. A10.7.  SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. A10.7.1.  Detainers  and  Pending  Charges.  Marriage  requests  from  confinees  who  have  a detainer and/or a pending charge shall be coordinated with the SJA to assess the legal effects of the marriage on those actions. A10.8.  MARRIAGE CEREMONY IN THE FACILITY. A10.8.1.  The DFC may approve the use of the facility for a short simple marriage ceremony. If a marriage ceremony poses a threat to the security or good order of the facility, the DFC may disapprove a marriage ceremony in the facility. The DFC may not delegate the authority to  approve  or  to  disapprove  a  marriage  ceremony  in  the  facility  below  the  level  of  Acting DFC. A marriage ceremony in the facility cannot be denied because it may inconvenience the facility. Ordinarily, if there is concern about facility security or good order, the matter can be resolved by controlling the place, time, and number of participants for the ceremony, or by placing  conditions  or  restrictions  on  the  ceremony.  When  the  DFC  approves  a  confinee's application  to  marry,  but  intends  to  deny  the  use  of  facility  for  the  marriage  ceremony,  the DFC documents the reasons for this disapproval and consults the SJA for other options (i.e., conduct the ceremony over speakerphones or conduct the marriage by proxy via a completed affidavit of absent applicant for marriage license). A10.8.2.  Expenses  for  a  marriage  ceremony  in  the  facility  are  paid  by  the  confinee,  the confinee's  intended  spouse,  the  confinee's  family,  or  other  appropriate  source  and  must  be determined  in  advance  and  approved  by  the  DFC.  The  DFC  may  not  permit  appropriated funds to be used for the marriage ceremony. A10.8.2.1.  The  marriage  ceremony  may  be  performed  by  any  military  chaplain, community clergy, or by a justice of the peace. The installation chaplain confirms that a 160 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 community person requested to perform the marriage ceremony is either a member of the clergy or a justice of the peace, in good standing. A10.8.2.2.  Because  of  ecclesiastical  constraints,  chaplains  may  decline  to  perform  the marriage  ceremony.  Upon  request  of  the  confinee,  the  chaplain  assists  the  confinee  in preparing  for  an  approved  marriage;  for  example,  by  providing,  or  arranging  for  a confinee to receive prenuptial marriage counseling. A10.8.3.  The  DFC  ensures  the  marriage  ceremony  be  a  short  private  ceremony  conducted without media publicity and without a best man or maid of honor. There will not be visiting time  between  the  couple  after  the  ceremony  unless  a  situation,  i.e.,  sign  legal  documents, warrants approval from the DFC. There are no conjugal visits. DFC notifies the appropriate MAJCOM  and  AFSFC/SFC  of  the  proposed  marriage  of  a  confinee  whose  marriage  might attract national attention, or significant local or regional attention. A10.9.  FACILITY SUPPLEMENT. Each DFC develops a facility Supplement establishing local procedures  to  implement  this  Program  Statement.  It  should  include,  but  not  be  limited  to, information on the local marriage laws and processing procedures (for example, marriage license requirements,  blood  tests).  Also  note  the  military  member’s  responsibility  to  complete  all requirements  in  arranging  for  the  military  identification  card  and  DEERS  and  Tri-Care enrollment.  AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 161 Attachment 11 SAMPLE – INITIAL VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION COVER LETTER Figure A11.1.

Air  Force  Return-to-Duty  (RTD).  The  Air  Force  maintains  a  service  unique  RTD system  (reference  10  USC  §§  951,  953).  The  system  offers  selected  court-martialed  enlisted personnel,  with  exceptional  potential,  the  opportunity  for  clemency  action  concerning  the characterization of their discharges and possible return to  duty. The goal  for the applicant  is  to prove that their successful rehabilitation is worthy to be considered for reenlistment in the Armed Services. A18.2.  Eligibility. A18.2.1.  Except  as  indicated  in  paragraph  A18.5.3.,  applicants  must  be  court-martialed enlisted  personnel  who  cannot  have  an  executed  discharge  or  be  retirement  eligible  on  the date of the application. (T-1) A18.2.2.  Applicants may not have a civilian or military conviction record of sex offenses or violent offenses. (T-1) A18.2.3.  Applicants  must  accept  responsibility  for their  crime(s)  and  must  have demonstrated  a  strong  and  serious  desire  to  change  negative  attitudes  and  behaviors,  as evidenced  by  their  post-trial  rehabilitation,  treatment  reports  and  volunteer  community service/employment efforts for those already released from confinement. (T-1) A18.2.4.  Applicants  must  have  had  an  otherwise  positive  record  of  military  training, experience, and performance. (T-1) A18.2.5.  At  time  of  application  the  applicants  must  be  worldwide  duty  qualified  as determined by medical authorities. (T-1) A18.2.6.  Applicants must have favorable personality characteristics as established by a post-trial  psycho-social  mental  health  evaluation.  The  mental  health  evaluation  summary  must support  a  reasonable  expectation  of  successful  life  skills  and  duty  performance.  The applicant’s  assigned  military  treatment  facility  (MTF)  (or  the  closest  MTF,  as  arranged  by the  assigned  MTF  if  the  geographic  separation  is  too  great)  shall  conduct  a  mental  health evaluation  by  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker,  psychologist,  or  psychiatrist.  CARE PROVIDERS: The following characteristics have been found valuable to successful RTD as candidate attributes; ability to accept constructive criticism, team orientation, dependability, assertiveness, motivation for change, adequate stress tolerance, at least average  intelligence, and  good  interpersonal  skills.  The  following  characteristics  have  been  found  to  be  less desirable  RTD  candidate  attributes:  patterns  of  poor  judgment,  patterns  of  impulsivity, history  of  violent  behavior  or  serious  psychological  problems  (bipolar  disorder,  recurrent major  depression,  any  psychotic  disorder,  diagnosed  personality  disorder),  conflict avoidance, and lack of initiative. (T-1) A18.3.  Application Process.  The applicant, with assistance from their defense counsel, submits a  letter  and  attachments  (no  specific  format)  to  the  Convening  Authority  (CA)  or  The  Judge Advocate  General  (TJAG)  requesting  a  recommendation  for  RTD.  (The  applicant  can  apply  to either  the  CA  or  TJAG,  but  not  both.)  The  defense  counsel  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 171 application,  with  either  the  CA  or  TJAG  recommendation  attachment,  is  forwarded  to  the  AF Clemency and Parole Board (AFC&PB). (T-1) A18.3.1.  The defense counsel’s assistance is  similar to  routine post trial  clemency  requests intended for the CA or TJAG; however, for the purposes of an application to RTD, specific concentration should concern: post trial rehabilitation and treatment, past duty performance, awards,  and  redemption  value  to  the  AF  and  society  in  general.  The  package  may  include letters  of  recommendation  from  military  supervisors  and  superiors,  as  well  as  letters  from religious  and  civil  leaders  (e.g.,  former  civilian  employers,  educators,  heads  of  volunteer organizations, etc.). The letter should state that the applicant  admits their guilt and presents their  past  performance  records  (military  and  incarceration  behavior  and  treatment  records) for review. The letter should state that the CA or TJAG and those in the decision chain up to and  including  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  are  authorized  to  view  medical  and  mental health  records.  If  confinement  was  approved,  the  letter  should  include  minimum  and maximum  release  dates,  as  well  as  an  attached  copy  of  the  DD  Form  2710-1,  Inmate Sentence Computation. Note to defense counsel: While the applicant is responsible to obtain as much of the supporting documentation  as possible on their own, some of the documents may  be  in  possession  of  the  confinement/corrections  staff  or  CA’s  Staff  Judge  Advocate. Upon request, those offices should provide those documents, not otherwise forbidden due to security or privacy issues, for inclusion in the application. If the applicant cannot reasonably obtain  documents  from  the  government  which  are  required  for  the  application,  defense counsel’s assistance may be necessary. (T-1) A18.3.2.  Except as provided in paragraph A18.5.1, the application is submitted after the CA has  taken  action  and  no  sooner  than  the  60th  day  following  the  date  of  the  applicant’s adjudged  sentence  and  no  later  than  one  year  after  their  adjudged  sentence.  The  AFC&PB cannot act on any application until the CA has taken action in the case. The AFC&PB may decide to waive the application time limits for good cause. (T-1) A18.3.3.  The  applicant  can  reapply  once  during  the  one  year  period  after  their  sentence  is adjudged, but only if significant change has occurred that was not previously considered by the AFC&PB. (Significant change means, for example, an outstanding confinement record or subsequent strong rehabilitation success.) (T-1) A18.3.4.  Once  started,  the  applicant  can  withdraw  their  request  at  any  time  during  the process  by  providing  the  CA  or  TJAG  and  the  AFC&PB  written  notice  via  their  defense counsel. (T-1) A18.3.5.  If  there  was  an  adjudged  sentence  to  confinement;  the  application  must  include  a letter  of  evaluation  from  the  confinement  facility.  This  letter  should  briefly  explain  the applicant’s  overall  behavior  as  determined  by  the  staff.  The  letter  can  come  from  any supervisory staff member no lower than the Confinement NCOIC, and can be supplemented by  the  Confinement  Officer.  The  DFC  includes  an  indorsement  briefly  explaining concurrence  or  non-concurrence.  The  letter  is  provided  to  their  defense  counsel.  To  avert agitation among the population the staff’s written indorsement is not provided directly to the inmate to prevent inadvertent sharing of the letter. (T-1) A18.3.6.  The  CA  or  TJAG  provides  a  concur  or  non-concur  recommendation  to  the application package within 30 days of receipt from the defense counsel and returns it to the 172 AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 defense  counsel mr.mbx.saf-mrbp-cpb@mail.mil . to  electronically  forward  to the  AFC&PB  at:  usaf.pentagon.saf-A18.4.  Rehabilitation.  The  applicant’s  record  while  in  confinement,  if  confinement  was adjudged, is an important tool for the decision team to consider. How completion of mandatory rehabilitation and treatment is characterized, as well as characterization of the number and types of voluntary rehabilitation and treatment, are essential for RTD consideration. (T-1) A18.4.1.  The  applicant  must  explain  negative  incidents  documented  while  in  confinement, e.g., respond to behavioral notations such as: malingers, quibbles, uses of passive resistance during treatment, receipt of excessive disciplinary reports, or receipt of facility Disciplinary and Adjustment Board findings. If so, the applicant should explain how it was mitigated. (T-1) A18.4.2.  For  applicants  who  received  either  no  sentence  to  confinement  or  less  than  a  six month  sentence  to  confinement,  the  applicant  should  provide  as  much  extracurricular voluntary program attendance (e.g., AA), self-improvement (e.g., education courses), and/or volunteer  community  service  as  possible.  Also  important  will  be  results  of  a  potential candidate’s  civilian  employment  while  on  appellate  leave  (e.g.,  timely  attendance, productiveness and restitution payment plan, if appropriate). (T-1) A18.4.3.  For  applicants  who  were  confined  in  a  non-military  facility  (usually  downtown), rehabilitative  opportunities  are  likely  limited;  therefore,  request  the  base  confinement  NCO to provide the appropriate Training, Treatment and Transition Program workbooks which are available  to  all  Level  I  confinees.  Successful  completion  of  the  workbooks  can  be  used  to help  support the  applicant’s  request  for  RTD.  For  scheduled  appointments  with qualified/privileged Mental Health provider bring workbooks and associated progress reports in order to assist the care provider with the on-going assessment and treatment effort. (T-1) A18.5.  Consideration  Process.  The  AFC&PB  reviews  the  submitted  package  and  makes  its decision  based  upon  historical  comparison  of  past  RTD  packages,  applicant’s  demonstrated redemptive quality(ies), as well as rehabilitation and treatment successes. A18.5.1.  For  approved  sentences  to  confinement  without  a  punitive  discharge,  AFC&PB approval prevents the discharge authority from executing an administrative discharge action that has been initiated, allowing the AFC&PB to retain the member on active duty or upgrade to  a  General  Discharge  or  an  Honorable  Discharge.  For  those  applicants  receiving  an Honorable  Discharge  from  the  AFC&PB,  the  coding  on  the  DD  Form  214,  Certificate  of Release  or  Discharge  from  Active  Duty,  shall  reflect  that  the  applicant  is  reenlistment eligible. See AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force and use reenlistment Code 2D per Table 5.2. (T-1) A18.5.1.1.  In  cases  where  a  punitive  discharge  was  not  adjudged,  the  applicant  may immediately submit an application to the CA or TJAG after action by the CA, provided notice of an administrative discharge action has been initiated against the applicant. (T-1) A18.5.2.  For  approved  sentences  with  or  without  confinement  and  an  unexecuted  punitive discharge,  AFC&PB  approval  orders  the  upgrade  of  the  characterization  to  a  General Discharge  or  an  Honorable  Discharge.  For  those  applicants  receiving  an  Honorable Discharge from the AFC&PB, the coding on the DD Form 214 shall reflect that the applicant is reenlistment eligible. (T-1) AFI31-105  15 JUNE 2015 173 A18.5.2.1.  NOTE:  Pending change to AFI 36-2606, Table 5.1.; reenlistment Code 1S is hereby  created.  The  Code  1S  reads,  Airmen  who  were  sentenced  by  court-martial  to dishonorable  or  bad  conduct  discharge  (with  or  without  confinement)  and  approved through the AFC&PB for return to active status or reentry into service. (T-1) A18.5.3.  With applicant approval, in cases when the member’s ETS  has expired or will do so during the decision process, HQ AFPC orders an extension of sufficient length to cover a period until such time as the final AFC&PB decision is made. A18.5.4.  In all actions for this application, the decision of the AFC&PB is final and cannot be appealed. However, when the decision of the AFC&PB grants any relief to the applicant, the  AFC&PB’s  decision  does  not  become  final  until  SAF/MR  and  the  Secretary  of  the  Air Force are provided with notice of the proposed decision and have been given an opportunity to transfer the matter to their level for decision.
