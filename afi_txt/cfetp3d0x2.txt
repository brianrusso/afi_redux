The changing Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) and Air and Space Expeditionary Aerospace Forces (AEF) environments require vision, preparation, and attention to ensure people have the right skills and tools to deliver the C4I capabilities and the support required by the warfighter in meeting the Air Force mission of today and the vision of the future.  Declining resources, expanding diversity of mission, and ever-changing technologies in the Air Force are impacting the availability of our most valuable resource--people.  These factors will continue to exist in the future, making it essential for the workforce to be effectively and efficiently trained to perform duties within each skill level of an Air Force Specialty (AFS).  To meet the challenges of tomorrow, the Air Force must place a greater emphasis on career field training.  This Cyber Systems Operations Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive core training document that identifies life-cycle training/education requirements, support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the 3D0X2 specialty.  The plan is a "training road map" for the career field.  It provides personnel a clear career path to success and makes career field training identifiable, measurable, and budget defensible. 2.  IMPORTANT:  This CFETP is not a stand-alone document.  It must be used in conjunction with the 3DXXX Cyberspace Support (Common Core) CFETP, which outlines tasks and courses shared by other 3D specialties.  Together, the 3DXXX and 3D0X2 CFETPs provide comprehensive career field guidance and training for members of the AFSC 3D0X2. 3.  The CFETP documents the career field training program and consists of two parts.  Management uses both parts in conjunction with Training Business Area (TBA) to plan, manage and control training within the career field.  NOTE:  Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training. 3.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training and other); Section D indicates resource constraints (e.g., funds, manpower, equipment, facilities); and Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 3.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, Training References (TRs) to support training, AETC-conducted training, wartime course and core task and correspondence course requirements.  Section B contains the Course Objectives List (COL) and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements.  Section C identifies available support materials (e.g., Qualification Training Packages (QTPs), which may be developed to support proficiency training).  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training, included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Section E identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements supervisors can use to 4 determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. 4.  Use of the guidance provided in this CFETP provides the foundation for effective and efficient training for individuals in this career field at the appropriate points in their careers.  This plan enables the Air Force to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.   5  Abbreviations/Terms Explained This section provides a common understanding of the terms that apply to the Cyber Systems Operations Career Field and Education Training Plan.

These tasks are only for those career fields that still need them applied to their schoolhouse tasks.  12  Section A - General Information 1.  Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP, when used in conjunction with the 3DXXX Cyberspace Support CFETP, provides the information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training those individuals in AFSC 3D0X2 should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their careers.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  This training is provided by the 336th Training Squadron (TRS) at Keesler AFB, MS.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, Career Development Course (CDC) completion and correspondence courses required for award of the 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some of which are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, develop, manage, and conduct a career field training program.  Also, ensures that established training is provided at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends training throughout each phase of an individual's career. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of the training, and provides the training medium. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field training program. 2.  Use of the CFETP.  The CFETP is maintained by the 3D0XX Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), SAF/CIO A6SF.  MAJCOM FMs and AETC review the plan annually to ensure currency and accuracy and forward recommended changes to the AFCFM.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they determine whether duplicate training exists and take steps to eliminate/prevent duplicate efforts.  Career field training managers at all levels use the plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training program is available for each individual in the career ladder. 2.1.  AETC training personnel develop/revise formal resident and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in the STS.  They also develop procurement and acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MAJCOM FMs ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial skill and upgrade requirements.  They also identify the needed AFJQSs/AFQTPs to document unique upgrade and continuation training requirements.  Requirements are satisfied through OJT, 13  resident training, contract training, or exportable courseware/courses.  MAJCOM developed training to support this AFSC must be included into this plan. 2.3.  81 TRSS/TSQ Qualification Training Flight (Q-Flight) personnel develop training packages (AFJQSs/AFQTPs) based on requests submitted by the MAJCOMs and according to the priorities assigned by the AFCFM. 2.4.  Unit level training managers and supervisors manage and control progression through the career field by ensuring individuals complete the mandatory training requirements for upgrade specified in this plan and supplemented by their MAJCOM.  The list of courses in Part II is used as a reference for planning continuation or career enhancement training. 2.5.  Submit recommended CFETP corrections to the 81 TRSS Q-Flight Customer Service Desk at 81 TRSS/TSQS, 601 D Street, Keesler AFB MS 39534-2235 or call DSN 597-3343.  To contact electronically send email to: qflight.customer.service@us.af.mil. 2.6.  Submit recommended CFETP additions/deletions through your MAJCOM Functional Manager. 3.  Coordination and Approval of the CFETP.  The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AETC training manager initiates an annual review of this document by AETC and MAJCOM functional managers to ensure the CFETP’s currency and accuracy by using the list of courses in Part II to eliminate duplicate training.  14  Section B - Career Field Progression and Information 4.

The training listed in this plan is specific to the AFSC 3D0X2 and must be used in conjunction with the common core training identified in the 3DXXX CFETP.  Mandatory requirements for upgrade training to each skill level are covered in Section C. 6.  Training Decisions.  This CFETP was developed to encapsulate an entire spectrum of training requirements for the Cyber Systems Operations career field, using a building block approach (simple to complex).  Included in this spectrum is the strategy of when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. 6.1.  Proficiency Training.  This training is job qualification for an assigned duty position.  Additional qualification training becomes necessary when personnel transfer to another duty position, the unit mission changes, a new personnel program comes on board, or any time changes in techniques or procedures occur.  17  6.1.1.  Dashed tasks are available in TBA for individual training plans (ITP) in the event an Airman performs the tasks. 6.1.2.  The 81 TRSS/TSQ (Q-Flight) develops AFJQSs/AFQTPs to support tasks relating to Cyber Operations and Systems, functions, and duties.  Completion of AFJQSs/AFQTPs is mandatory by duty position for personnel in upgrade or qualification training. 6.2.  Seven-Level Upgrade Training Requirements:  Completion of the E6ACW3DX7X 01AA Cyberspace Career Advancement Course is mandatory. 6.3.  Nine-Level training requirements.  Completion of E6ACW3DX9X 00AA Cyberspace Superintendent Course is mandatory. 7.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Academic Programs.  Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of basic military training.  CCAF provides the opportunity for all enlisted members to obtain an Associate in Applied Science degree.  In order to be awarded the degree must be completed before the student separates from the Air Force, retires, or is commissioned as an officer.  In addition to its associate’s degree program, CCAF offers the following: 7.1.  CCAF Instructor Certification.  The College offers the CCAF Instructor Certification to instructors teaching full time in a CCAF affiliated school.  To qualify, instructors must complete a 3 semester hour Instructor Methodology course, a 12 semester hour Teaching Internship, have one year teaching experience from date of Teaching Internship completion, hold an associate or higher degree, complete at least 1,000 hours of documented practical experience teaching a CCAF course(s), and be recommended by their commander/commandant. 7.2.  The Information System Technology (0IYY) program applies to the 3D0X2 career field. 7.2.1.  Degree Requirements:  Individuals must hold the 5-skill level at the time of program completion.

General Education (15 semester hours):  Courses must meet the criteria for application of courses to the General Education requirement and be in agreement with the definitions of applicable General Education subjects/courses as outlined in the CCAF General Catalog. 7.2.6.  General Education Mobile (GEM):  GEM is a partnership between CCAF and civilian academic institutions to offer general education courses to meet CCAF A.A.S. degree requirements.  Courses are offered via distance learning which reduces CCAF educational impact of deployments, PCS and family commitments. 7.2.7.  Program Elective (15 semester hours):  Courses applying to technical education, LMMS or general education requirements; natural science courses meeting general education requirement application criteria; foreign language credit earned at Defense Language Institute or through the Defense Language Proficiency Test; maximum 9 Semester Hours of CCAF degree-applicable technical course credit otherwise not applicable to program of enrollment. 7.3.  See the current CCAF General Catalog for details regarding the Associates of Applied Science in Computer Science Technology.  The catalog is available at your education office or from http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/. 7.4.  Additional off-duty education is highly encourage, but is a personal choice that is encouraged for all.  Individuals desiring to become an AETC instructor should be actively pursuing an associate degree.  A degreed faculty is necessary to maintain CCAF’s accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.  19 8.  Career Field Path.

(Example: b and 1b) **  A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.  (-)  This mark is used alone in Proficiency Codes Course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources. NOTE:  All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime. (-)   When this code is used in the Core & Wartime Tasks Column it indicates that the qualification is a local determination.

Measurement.  Each objective is indicated as follows:  W indicates task or subject knowledge, which is measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check, and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a progress check. 5.  Standard.  The standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 6.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. Section C - Support Materials 7.
