Purpose.    This  publication  establishes  tailored  processes  for  the  system  planning,  design, acquisition,  deployment,  operations,  maintenance,  and  modernization  of  DBS,  as  defined  in DoDI  5000.02,  and  assigns  tailored  responsibilities  and  procedures  for  meeting  DoDI  5000.02 and  AFI  63-101/20-101  requirements.    This  manual  is  focused  on  guidance  for  the  acquisition and  sustainment  of  DBS  resulting  from  the  documentation  of  requirements  defined  IAW AFMAN 33-402 and can be used as a guideline and for tailoring IAW statute and sound business practice.    1.2.  Applicability.    This  manual  applies  to  the  acquisition  management  of  DBS  from  the Materiel  Development  Decision  (MDD)  to  Disposal.    All  members  of  the  acquisition  and sustainment community should use this guidance in partnership with higher level guidance cited, other Air Force Directive Guidance, and the Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG).  All DBS programs are Acquisition Category (ACAT) programs and this manual is applicable throughout the  program  life  cycle  including  the  Operations  and  Support  Phase  to  Disposal.    All  DBS programs  under  Major  Automated  Information  System  (MAIS)  thresholds  shall  be  managed under  the  appropriate  Air  Force  Program  Executive  Officer  (PEO).  The  PEO  shall  act  as Milestone  Decision  Authority  (MDA)  unless  otherwise  directed.  The  Functional  Sponsor  shall use the PEO Portfolio Assignment Process for assignment to the appropriate PEO.  1.2.1.  This manual is applicable to DBS under the Air Force Service Acquisition Executive (SAE)  oversight  (ACAT  IAC  /  ACAT  III)  and  AF  PEO  control.    DBS  meeting  the  MAIS threshold  or  designated  special  interest  or  subject  to  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense (OSD)  oversight  shall  meet  the  requirements  of  DoDI  5000.02  and  may  not  implement  the tailored procedures specified within this AFMAN without the consent of the OSD Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), but may use this AFMAN for guidance.  1.2.2.  Regardless  of  ACAT,  where  there  is  a  clear  conflict  between  approved  courses  of action  and  where  policy/guidance  does  not  allow  for  tailoring  of  acquisition  processes,  the programmatic chain of authority shall request waivers from the appropriate office.   1.3.  Background.   This AFMAN and the tailored processes within were written to help deliver capability  quickly;  it  recognizes  that  Information  Technology  (IT)  requires  frequent  upgrades, requirements may need to be reprioritized, and new opportunities may emerge.  The goal of this AFMAN  is  to  enable  the  acquisition  and  deployment  of  viable  DBS  capabilities  to  match  the speed  at  which  they  are  needed  by  the  user.    This  AFMAN  streamlines  standard  processes, decision milestones, and information requirements to achieve quicker, more responsive programs to  deliver  capability  quickly  and  efficiently.    The  following  key  tenets  contribute  to  achieving this goal:  1.3.1.  Early  and  continuing  user  and  PEO/Program  Manager  (PM)  involvement.    The Functional  Sponsor,  on  behalf  of  the  user,  needs  to  ensure  that  the  PM  or  Development Planning  (DP)  for  the  PEO  is  involved  in  the  early  upfront  technical  and  lifecycle requirements definition to ensure clearly defined functional requirements are passed onto the developers  of  the  materiel  solution.    Additionally,  the  PM  needs  to  ensure  Functional Sponsor  continuing  involvement  to  facilitate  design  tradeoffs  and  to  better  align  end  user 6 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 follow-on  requirements  and  impacts  across  the  Doctrine,  Organization,  Training,  Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P) spectrum.  These tradeoffs may include  training  plans,  operational  procedures,  personnel  skills,  information  security,  and facility maintenance.  Engagement during the design and build process can allow for greater efficiency, with  some level  of  requirements sequencing, tradeoffs, or Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) presented design decisions to deliver, operate, and sustain the capability.  1.3.2.  Rapidly  deliver  capability  incrementally.    The  PM  needs  to  consider  approaches which deliver increased capability over time, recognizing up-front the users’ need for future capability  improvements.    To  ensure  this  approach  is  viable,  the  PM  will  work  with  the Functional Sponsor to define capability improvements that can deliver useful and supportable operational  capabilities  that  can  be  developed,  tested,  produced,  deployed,  and  sustained.  The PM should consider the agile framework to provide almost continuous feedback to help refine the deployment of the capability.  To the extent practical, incremental transformation plans  and  incremental  DBS  capability  delivery  requirements  should  be  identified  in  the Sponsor’s Implementation Plans and Bounded User Requirements.   1.3.3.  Tailor acquisition to meet user requirements based on risk.  The objective is to bring the  right  information  and  people  to  the  point  of  decision-making  while  reducing  non-value added  work.    This  tenet  is  based  on  the  need  for  decisions  to  be  focused  on  delivering capabilities with the most efficient cost and schedule given the risks. Decisions should not be based  on  non-value  added  or  standard  documentation,  if  that  is  counter  to  the  appropriate level  of  risk  for  the  capability.    This  is  supported  by  utilizing  portfolio  approaches (documented in Chapter 3) and identifying the appropriate documentation vice relying on a standard  checklist.    The  PM  should  leverage  information  developed  as  part  of  the requirements process.  1.3.4.  Be  outcome  oriented.    The  Functional  Sponsor  identifies  outcomes  that  improve effectiveness  (e.g.,  help  improve  the  quality  of  the  user’s  performance)  and/or  efficiency (e.g.,  enable  the  user  to  perform  more  quickly  or  accomplish  the  same  performance  with fewer  resources)  as  compared  to  the  user’s  current  level  of  performance.    Improved performance,  both  in  terms  of  effectiveness  and  efficiency,  is  captured  through  high-level performance measures.  If a materiel solution is necessary, performance measures related to the  materiel  solution  should  be  quantitative  and  testable,  support  the  definition  of  specific performance  requirements  for  the  materiel  solution,  and  inform  the  test  and  evaluation planning  and  assessment  of  the  capability.    The  PM  should  expect  and  require  clear performance  measures  from  the  Functional  Sponsor  that  can  be  linked  to  the  acquisition requirements  that  must  be  satisfied.    Understanding  what  the  target  goal  is  and  measuring capability  performance  against  the  target  goal  provides  verification  the  capability  is functioning as expected and the end user’s problem is solved or needs are met.   1.4.  Key DBS Tailoring Concepts.  1.4.1.  Agility in Acquisition.  Tailoring, Delegation of Decision Authority, and the Portfolio Approach  help  support  Agility  in  Acquisition  by  setting  up  constructs  to  allow  PEOs  and PMs to effectively field capabilities in shorter timeframes.  With reduced documentation and portfolio  level  processes  defined  in  this  AFMAN,  programs  can  limit  the  amount  of approvals needed to deploy and gain approval.    AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 7 1.4.2.  Tailoring.    Tailoring  provides  the  ability  to  integrate,  consolidate,  incorporate,  and streamline  strategies,  oversight,  reviews,  decision  levels,  documentation,  and  information.  The  purpose  is  to  streamline  the  acquisition  program  to  the  maximum  extent  possible, consistent with  risk, in  order to  deliver a  capability most efficiently and effectively. MDAs will promote maximum flexibility in tailoring programs under their oversight to fit particular conditions  of  that  program,  consistent  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  and  the  time sensitivity  of  the  capability  need.    MDAs  and  PMs  will  tailor  within  the  scope  of  the applicable  statute  or  regulation  and  eliminate  non-value  added  tasks  whenever  possible.  MDAs  shall  not  waive  requirements  when  the  waiver  authority  resides  outside  MDA authority. Waiver authority, other than those explicitly defined, belongs to the publication or requirement  owner.  A  waiver  is  an  expressed  or  written  statement  to  relinquish  or  provide exceptions to specific statutory or regulatory requirement.  1.4.3.  Delegate  Decision  Authority.    Decision  authority  should  be  delegated  when appropriate and when properly documented.  The MDA should assign responsibilities to the lowest appropriate and permissible statutory and regulatory level. This approach strengthens accountability,  reduces  bureaucracy,  and  accelerates  positive  outcomes.    This  AFMAN allows  the  MDA  to  delegate  multiple  decision  points  and  documentation  approvals  to strengthen this approach.  1.4.4.  Portfolio Approach.  Portfolio management processes should be used, where available, from the AF Chief Information Officer (CIO), the PEO, and the Functional Sponsor.    1.4.4.1.  The  CIO  process  for  Portfolio  Management  (PfM)  leverages  industry  best practices to implement a capability based mission/business process and a scenario driven approach to align IT applications to securely meet Mission Area needs.  The process will provide  application/infrastructure  investment  alignment  to  develop  and  maintain  an integrated  risk-controlled  portfolio  of  programs  and  initiatives  for  the  effective  and efficient  delivery  of  materiel  solutions  in  support  of  mission  capability.    PfM  will leverage  a  Capital  Planning  and  Investment  Control  (CPIC)  process  that  links  to  and supports budget formulation and execution.  1.4.4.2.  The PEO should focus on a portfolio approach in respect to process development and shared risk among the programs within the portfolio by proactively applying lessons learned and benefitting from work conducted on one program informing the development of  the  next  program.    The  PEO  should  standardize  process  application  among  the programs  and  provide  shared  resources  (tools,  techniques,  manpower)  to  apply  against multiple  programs.    This  portfolio  approach  also  reduces  documentation  workload  by completing some requirements at the portfolio level one time vice multiple times for each individual program.  1.4.4.3.  The Functional Sponsor supported by the PEO should review their requirements to  match  to  the  acquisition  efforts  already  in  place  by  accelerating,  delaying,  or reallocating known requirements as acquisition opportunities present themselves.  8 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  2.1.

The  PM  supports  the  Functional  Portfolio Manager  to  follow  the  process  as  defined  per  applicable  OSD  DBC  DBS  Investment Management  guidance  and  AF  DCMO  DBS  Investment  Management  guidance  to  achieve certification on Priority and Covered DBS.  3.1.1.  The requirements satisfied by the OEP are codified in 10 USC §2222.  The Functional Portfolio Manager may  be required to  address  new requirements  arising  from  the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Chief Management Officer (OSD DCMO) or the Air Force DCMO.  3.1.2.  General OEP Guidance.  Along with the Service OEPs, the Air Force DCMO, as the PCA on Air Force Priority DBS and Certification Authority on Air Force Covered DBS, will provide  a  single  memorandum  asserting  compliance  with  Business  Enterprise  Architecture (BEA) and compliance with the guidelines for Business Process Reengineering (BPR).  The OEP  certification  requests  must  comply  with  laws,  regulations,  and  policy,  such  as  the Clinger-Cohen Act.  The PCA submits the Portfolio Certification Request (PCR) to the OSD DCMO to formally assert the need for all systems requiring certification.  3.2.  Required DBS Processes.  3.2.1.  Service Development and Delivery Process (SDDP).  SDDP, documented in AFMAN 33-402,  ensures  the  Functional  Sponsor  considers  all  possible  Doctrine,  Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities, and Policy (DOTMLPF-P)  solutions  to  the  end  user’s  need/problem,  enables  successful  implementation  of  IT investments  and  ensures  IT  capabilities  are  not  acquired  unnecessarily.    The  end  user problems are driven by a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency in the execution of AF  mission  processes.  These  processes  include  the  business  processes  associated  with logistics,  personnel,  finance,  acquisition  and  business  operations.    AFMAN  33-402  is required  prior  to  a  DBS  undergoing  a  development  or  modernization  effort  that  adds capabilities that are outside the scope of the current problem statement.  AFMAN 33-402 is required whenever the following conditions apply:  3.2.1.1.  Development of a new mission capability;  3.2.1.2.  Modernization  of  an  existing  capability  that  adds  or  modifies  the  functional capability of the existing system;  3.2.1.3.  Organizational restructuring or alignment resulting in process re-engineering that affects the supporting systems; or  3.2.1.4.  When an existing capability is extended to a new user base.  3.2.2.  Clinger-Cohen  Act  (CCA) Compliance.  DBS programs  are required to  comply  with CCA as documented in AFMAN 33-407, Air Force Clinger-Cohen Act  (CCA) Compliance Guide.    Prior  to  every  milestone  decision  starting  with  MS  A  and  contract  award,  the  PM shall  ensure  that  the  required  documentation  is  available  to  ensure  CCA  compliance.    All AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 13 DBS  programs  are  required  to  submit  a  completed  CCA  compliance  table  and  supporting documentation to the AF CIO IAW AFMAN 33-407.  3.2.3.  Business Process Reengineering (BPR).  BPR is required for all DBS systems and is done IAW processes laid out in AFMAN 33-402.  BPR is a comprehensive process requiring a  change  in  the  fundamental  way  business  processes  are  performed.    Business  Process Reengineering/Process Reengineering identifies unnecessary activities, eliminates them, and wherever  possible,  automates  manual  procedures.    This  may  include  eliminating  non-value added process steps, consolidating separate functional tasks into end-to-end cross-functional processes,  and  integrating  business  functions  as  much  as  possible  to  improve  business operations  and  to  achieve  the  desired  outcome(s).  To  the  greatest  extent possible,  PMs  and acquisition  teams  should  acquire  those  materiel  solutions  that  enable  the  functional’s  re-engineered  processes,  but  processes  may  also  need  to  be  revised  based  on  the  features presented  by  the  materiel  solution  to  ensure  that  customization  of  the  materiel  solution  is limited as much as possible.  The business processes inherent in the materiel solution should be  adopted,  not  adapted,  by  the  organization  implementing  the  product.    This  means  the organization changes its processes to accommodate the materiel solution not vice versa.  PMs and  Functional  Sponsors  should  work  together  to  update  any  BPR  documentation  when presented with opportunities to take advantage of materiel solution features that may diverge from the requirements developed before a solution was acquired.  3.3.  Defense Business System Tailored Framework.    This framework (Figure 3.1) is the Air Force  tailored  DoDI  5000.02  model  suggested  for  use  by  DBS  programs.    The  model  takes advantage of work conducted during the requirements process to streamline the early stages and focuses  on  utilizing  a  common  infrastructure  and  standards  to  simplify  sustainment  of  DBS.  This  model  combines  the  MS  A  and  B  decision  point  based  upon  the  work  conducted  in partnership with the Functional Sponsor during the requirements process.  MS A may be added back  in  to  limit  risk  at  the  discretion  of  the  MDA.    Note:    DoDI  5000.02  defines  the requirements  and  timing  for  reaching  IOC  within  5  years  and  the  determination  of  what constitutes IOC.  “This model is distinguished from the previous model by the rapid delivery of capability  through  multiple  acquisition  increments,  each  of  which  provides  part  of  the  overall required  program  capability.  Each  increment  may  have  several  limited  deployments;  each deployment will result from a specific build and provide the user with a mature and tested sub-element  of the overall incremental  capability. Several  builds and deployments will typically be necessary to satisfy approved requirements for an increment of capability. The identification and development  of  technical  solutions  necessary  for  follow-on  capability  increments  have  some degree  of  concurrency,  allowing  subsequent  increments  to  be  initiated  and  executed  more rapidly.”  (DoDI 5000.02, 7 January 2015)   14 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 Figure 3.1.  Tailored DBS Life Cycle Management Model.   3.4.  AFMAN  33-402  and  DBS  Acquisition  AFMAN  relationship.    The  first  three  steps  of AFMAN  33-402  relate  to  the  acquisition  process  defined  in  this  DBS  Acquisition  AFMAN similar  to  the  way  that  JCIDS  relates  to  the  acquisition  process  defined  in  DoDI  5000.02.  AFMAN  33-402  starts  the  process  for  the  development  of  new  capabilities  by  defining  the Functional Sponsor defined business level requirements in a Problem Statement and then works in  conjunction  with  the  acquisition  process  to  refine  the  requirements  for  a  materiel  solution.  The  Functional  Sponsor  and  the  PM  then  continue  to  work  together  refining  the  requirement which  results  in  an  updated  Problem  Statement  and  Bounded  User  Requirement  (BUR)  which supports development  of the System Requirements  Document (SRD)  as part of the hand-off to the  acquisition  process  defined  in  this  AFMAN.    Activities  in  AFMAN  33-402  after  Step  3 support the development of the materiel solution by ensuring DOT_LPF-P elements required to operate  and  sustain  the  materiel  solution  are  available  at  time  of  deployment  to  support  the solution throughout its lifecycle.  Note:  Complete SRD IAW AFI 63-101/20-101    3.4.1.  AFMAN 33-402 and DBS Acquisition AFMAN alignment.  AFMAN 33-402 and the DBS  Acquisition  AFMAN  steps  align  per  Figure  3.2.    Basic  alignment  tenets  can  be described as follows:  (1) MDD is aligned with the beginning of Step 3 of AFMAN 33-402 but  must  occur  prior  to  COA  Evaluation;  (2)  Development  RFP  occurs  after  Step  3  of AFMAN  33-402,  after  delivery  of  the  Bounded  User  Requirements  (BUR)  and  after  the updated  Problem  Statement  is  approved;  and  (3)  After  delivery  of  the  BUR,  the  updated Problem Statement, and completion of the SRD, AFMAN 33-402 is focused on DOT_LPF-P planning and execution not the development of the Materiel Solution.   AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 15 Figure 3.2.  AFMAN 63-144 and AFMAN 33-402 Alignment.   3.5.  Portfolio and Program Approach.    DBS should be delivered using a portfolio approach. The portfolio approach enables some of the common acquisition processes and documents to be built  and  maintained  at  the  portfolio  level  and  applied  to  multiple  programs.    A  program  can implement all aspects of the portfolio approach or create annexes/alterations appropriate for that program.   The PEO will determine and document  the portfolio processes  (can be one portfolio process  per  PEO  or  can  be  split  into  multiple  processes  for  different  programs  to  implement), allowing  programs  to  document  only  the  differences  between  the  approved  portfolio  processes and  implementation  requirements  at  the  program  level.    The  PEO  will  utilize  shared  resources including  tools,  techniques,  and  manpower  to  reduce  cost  and  ensure  standard  application.  Example:    The  PEO-level  portfolio  risk  management  plan  will  identify  the  processes  used  to determine  program  risks  and  mitigation  strategies.    The  program  specific  information  shall  be documented  per  PEO  direction  and  will  identify  the  program  specific  risks  and  mitigation  but will not have to define a separate process.  The portfolio risk management plan would relieve a program of developing a stand-alone risk management plan.    3.5.1.  Portfolio Documents.  Portfolio documents, when implemented, will be prepared and approved  at  the  PEO  level.    The  documents  will  be  focused  on  acquisition  process documentation that describes shared processes to be used by all or some of the programs in a PEO portfolio.  Portions of the documents that require specific program information will be documented  per  PEO  direction  for  the  program.    The  specific  program  information  will  be provided  for  MDA  approval  when  required.    Programs  will  identify  the  specific  Portfolio Documents being used.  PEOs may have multiple sets of portfolio level documents. Table 3.1 identifies candidate portfolio documents.  Table 3.1.  Portfolio Documents.

Use the Cyber Capstone Threat Assessment.  Acquisition Intelligence products and services can be provided through the supporting Senior Intelligence Officer Unique Program Information shall be documented per PEO direction and included for MDA decisions when required. DBS programs on the OSD oversight list or USD(AT&L) designated special interest programs require a standalone TEMP approved by DOT&E and/or DASD(DT&E). Unique Program Information shall be documented per PEO direction and included for MDA decisions when required. 3.5.2.  Program  Documents.    Program  documents  are  prepared  at  the  program  level  and approved as identified in Table 3.2.  Program documents are required for each program even if a Portfolio document strategy is being implemented; however, appropriate tailoring should be  considered  including  combining  documents,  streamlining  information  requirements,  and waiving  documents  with  approval  of  the  designated  waiver  authority.    All  tailoring  and AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 17 waiving  considerations  should  be  documented  in  the  Acquisition  Strategy.    For  follow-on modifications  and  increments,  programs  should  update  the  original  program  documentation versus completing new documentation.  Table 3.2 identifies program documents.

Purpose.    The  activities  performed  and  the  documentation  required  in  the  DBS  Problem Statement will be used in lieu of JCIDS capability requirements documents. Business Capability Definition precedes the MDD, and is designed to assess the business problem, identify required business  process  re-engineering,  and  inform  development  of  the  Initial  Problem  Statement (PRM).  The work conducted during this phase is primarily the responsibility of the Functional Sponsor and will result in a thorough understanding of the problem, need, or gap at a root cause level,  the  successful  identification  of  the  desired  outcome,  and  the  completion  of  a  clearly-defined, scoped,  and  approved  Initial Problem Statement (PRM)  along  with  other DOT_LPF-P actions.  The  execution  of  this  phase  results  in  process-derived  solutions  across  the  entire DOTMLPF-P spectrum.  The initial activity focuses on defining the end user problem in detail, transforming  business  or  mission  processes,  and  identifying  a  set  of  potential  DOTMLPF-P actions  to  address  the  need  or  problem.    It  is  conceivable  an  effort  would  terminate  when  a Sponsor selects an identified non-materiel solution that would resolve the original user problem. Termination would still be considered a success, as user needs may be fulfilled with non-materiel solutions.  4.2.  Phase  Activities  and  Considerations.    Activities  during  this  phase  will  result  in  the successful  completion  of  the  work  required  to  complete  a  MDD  and  be  conducted  by  the Functional  Sponsor  utilizing  AFMAN  33-402.    The  work  conducted  during  this  phase  aligns with steps 1, 2, and the beginning of Step 3 of AFMAN 33-402.  A general sequence of activity for phase activities is contained in Figure 4.1.   Figure 4.1.  BCD Phase Activities.   AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 23 4.2.1.  Acquisition Support.  Acquisition support during Step 2 and the beginning of Step 3 of AFMAN 33-402 can be provided by Development Planning (DP) or by a PM.  Development planning  activities  provide:  market  research  on  products  and  services  identifying  realm  of possible;  enterprise  architecture;  architecture  tools;  business  model  traceability;  facilitate mission  threads;  technical  considerations;  and  initial  cost  and  schedule  estimates  to  meet MDD  requirements.    Note:    As  the  Functional  Sponsor  is  executing  AFMAN  33-402  to identify  Mission  Processes  to  deliver  DOTMLPF-P  Capabilities  they  should  identify  if acquisition  support  is  needed.    The  acquisition  organization  will  provide  a  proposal  for  the effort  and  funding  required  for  accomplishing  the  work.  Contact  the  AFPEO/BES Acquisition Support Office (AFLCMC/HID) for acquisition support (ASO@us.af.mil).   4.2.2.  Materiel Solution.  The Functional Sponsor will determine whether a materiel solution may be required to solve the problem.  Assuming the Functional Sponsor’s course of action may consist of a materiel solution; they with acquisition support (DP or PM) will determine what areas to analyze post-MDD and make the determination as to the appropriate solution mix (materiel and non-materiel) that will achieve the defined outcomes.  If the requirement may  result  in  the  acquisition  of  a  materiel  solution,  the  analysis  and  selection  will  also support  an  MDD  and  selection  of  the  preferred  alternative  post-MDD.    The  Functional Sponsor with  acquisition support (DP or PM) will  then begin  preparation  of the documents required for a MDD.  4.2.3.  Problem  Statement  Approval.    Problem  Statement  should  be  created  using  the  latest DBC approved template.  Problem Statement should reuse contents from approved AFMAN 33-402  documents  (ex:  PRM  from  AFMAN  33-402  Step  1).   Functional  Sponsor  approved Problem  Statement  will  be  coordinated  by  the  ESWG  and  approved  by  AF  DCMO  for Covered DBS or approved by OSD DBC for Priority DBS.  Work conducted IAW AFMAN 33-402 will inform the development of the Problem Statement required by DoDI 5000.02.    4.2.4.  MDD preparation.    4.2.4.1.  PEO  Portfolio  Assignment.    The  Functional  Sponsor  shall  inform  SAF/AQ  of the  potential  program.  Information  provided  contains  proposed  program  description, estimated dollar value, funding status, and anticipated ACAT. With input from AFMC or AFSPC, SAF/AQ  will assign the effort  to  a PEO and include  confirmation  of proposed ACAT  level  and  MDA  authority.    Send  PEO  Portfolio  Assignment  requests  to SAF/AQXE (usaf.pentagon.saf-aq.mbx.saf-aqxe--enterprise-execution-wkflw@mail.mil).   4.2.4.2.  MDD Documentation.  The Functional Sponsor with acquisition support (DP or PM) will utilize artifacts developed using AFMAN 33-402 to prepare the documentation required  for  an  MDD.    The  documentation  required  for  an  MDD  is  listed  in  Table  4.1. Note: Approval authority for documentation is contained in Section 3.4.  Table 4.1.  MDD Documentation.  Document Problem Statement Responsible Activity Functional Sponsor Notes: Results of activities in this phase are summarized in the Problem Statement by the Functional Sponsor. This summarization should provide 24 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 AoA Study Guidance and Plan Functional Sponsor and MDA Affordability Analysis Functional Sponsor decision makers with the essential information about the business need to make an informed decision supporting the IRB Problem Statement Review and Approval. At this point the Problem Statement includes the PRM. AoA Study Plan should take into account the objectives and corresponding measures developed during BCD as well as the results of the initial BPR, as these will provide valuable input to how each alternative will be evaluated.  These plans will be presented at MDD for approval by the MDA.  Refer to DoDI 5000.02 for AoA requirements. The purpose of affordability analysis is to avoid starting or continuing programs that cannot be produced and supported within reasonable expectations for future budgets. Affordability analysis is used to ensure capability requirements prioritization and cost tradeoffs occur as early as possible in program planning and throughout the program’s life cycle.Affordability Analysis should involve the domain programming, resource planning, requirements, portfolio management, and acquisition communities and will yield tentative cost goals at MDD Refer to DoDI 5000.02 for specific requirements 4.3.  MDD.    The  AoA  Study  Guidance  and  Study  Plan,  along  with  the  approved  Problem Statement,  will  be  reviewed  by  the  MDA  at  the  MDD.    Normally  the  information  required  to conduct  a  MDD  is  developed  by  the  beginning  of  AFMAN  33-402  step  3  prior  to  COA evaluation.    This  decision  directs  execution  of  the  AoA  including  expected  timelines,  and authorizes  the  acquiring  activity  to  conduct  the  next  phase.    MDD  initiates  the  exploration  of possible materiel  solutions and does not  define a specific materiel  solution  for implementation.  The decision starts the transition from requirements to acquisition which is continued post-MDD.  4.3.1.  MDD Exit.  Upon completion of the MDD, the MDA shall sign an ADM documenting entry into the next phase.  The ADM will also document if the MDA has determined that any document  that  was  considered  “as  needed”  (see  Table  3.3)  is  now  required,  otherwise  the document will be treated as not required.  The ADM will also identify the PM for the effort.  Note:  At this point Acquisition Support normally begins the transition from DP activity to activities conducted by a Program Office; however, program office support should gradually ramp up while supporting the AoA to a more substantial presence to meet the requirements of  the Development RFP.    4.3.2.  Acquisition  Master  List.  The  PM  shall  ensure  that  the  program  is  listed  on  the Acquisition Master List, in accordance with AFI 63-101/20-101.  AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 25 Chapter 5 MATERIEL SOLUTION ANALYSIS AND RISK REDUCTION (MDD TO MS A/B)  5.1.  Purpose.    To  assess  potential  materiel  solutions  and  develop  the  strategy  to  acquire  any potential  materiel  solution,  this  phase  translates  validated  capability  gaps  into  system-specific requirements including cybersecurity protections.  This phase also reduces risk to a point that the decision to contract can be made with confidence.  MS A and B can often be combined due to the  fact  that  most  DBS  rely  on  existing  or  commercial  technologies  utilizing  shared infrastructure,  existing  support  processes,  and  market  research  and  design  work  conducted  as part of the requirements process.  MS A may be added back in to address risk at the discretion of the MDA.  The expected outcomes and outputs for the phase are summarized in Table 5.1.  Table 5.1.  Phase Expected Outcomes and Outputs.

Phase  Activities  and  Considerations.    Activities  during  this  phase  will  result  in  the successful  completion  of  the  work  required  to  complete  a  MS  A/B.    The  activities  during  this phase  are  the  responsibility  of  the  PM  and  the  Functional  Sponsor  and  are  focused  on  the implementation of a materiel solution in the form of IT capabilities and assessing the probability of  success  of  the  implementation  against  performance  measures  identified  as  part  of  the  end user’s need/problem statement.    A general sequence for phase activities is contained in Figure. 5.1.  26 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 Figure 5.1.  Materiel Solution Analysis and Risk Reduction Activities.   5.2.1.  Portfolio Processes Determination.  The PM shall determine the portfolio processes as defined  in  the  portfolio  documentation  identified  in  Table  3.1  that  the  program  will  follow for execution of the program and document per PEO direction.  5.2.2.  Materiel Solution Analysis.  The Functional Sponsor will lead an effort to describe the needed  requirements  to  achieve  the  high-level  outcomes  and  business  outcomes  defined  in the Problem Statement.  A framework of outcomes must ensure continuity between the high level  objectives and program  outcomes, and provide the basis for developing more specific system-level  requirements  to  be  tested  during  execution.    This  effort  will  take  place  from MDD  to  the  Problem  Statement  Approval  and  will  be  done  in  conjunction  with  the  PM  to determine feasibility and requirements for each alternative.  This additional information will result in an updated Problem Statement (PRM/BRM/DOTMLPF-P Implementation Plan) and the BUR certified by the AF DCMO.  Analysis of the materiel alternatives will consider all possible  approaches  to  implementation,  including  web  services,  traditional  systems  and COTS/GOTS software, including modernization (adding new capability) of legacy systems, and  leverage  reusable  components  as  much  as  possible.    Additionally,  alternatives  must  be weighed against technical maturity to ensure the alternative is sufficiently mature enough to integrate  into  a  system.  Alternatives  must  also  consider  requirements  associated  with  the management of data associated with the system and interfaces.  5.2.2.1.  Analysis  of  Alternatives  (AoA).    The  Functional  Sponsor  with  the  PM  will conduct  an  AoA  to  compare  the  business  capability,  performance  potential,  operational effectiveness, cost, and risks of a number of potential alternative solutions to address the problem  identified  in  the  Problem  Statement.    The  AoA  Study  Guide  and  Plan,  as approved by the MDA, is used to conduct the AoA.  The Functional Sponsor with the PM shall leverage and align the COA evaluation completed in AFMAN 33-402 to complete the AoA.  Each alternative must be evaluated in terms of the initial set of IT requirements AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 27 and  information  assets  that  address  the  high  level  outcomes,  business  processes,  and measures in the Problem Statement and how well it supports the “to-be” state as defined by  the  initial  BPR.    Additionally,  it  will  focus  on  identification  and  analysis  of alternatives: measures of effectiveness; key trades between cost and capability; total life cycle cost, including sustainment; schedule; concepts of operations; and overall risk. The AoA will be informed by affordability analysis, cost analysis, sustainment considerations, early systems  engineering  and design analyses, cybersecurity, test considerations, threat projections,  and  market  research.  The  results  will  be  summarized  in  the  Acquisition Strategy  and  the  results  of  the  AoA  shall  be  approved  IAW,  DoDI  5000.02,  and  this publication.    5.2.2.2.  Market  Research.  One  of  the  purposes  of  market  research  is  to  determine whether there are products that meet the defined requirements, if existing product could be  modified  to  meet  requirements,  if  existing  government  owned  solutions  will  meet requirements, or if they could meet requirements modified to a reasonable extent.  Reuse of  existing  solutions  will  reduce  implementation  cost  and  time,  simplifies  the  technical implementation  of the  programmatic implementation.    Market  Research  is  also  used  to  determine  a  competitive  environment and  small  business  capability.    Appropriate  market  research  includes  thorough,  data driven  research  identifying  small  business  capabilities  and  expected  small  business participation levels such as RFIs and surveys.  Market research will feed the AoA study plan and the results of the AoA.  solution,  and the  materiel simplifies 5.2.2.3.  Selection  of  Preferred  Alternative.    The  Functional  Sponsor  with  the  PM  shall select  the  best-value  alternative  in  terms  of  cost,  best  fit  for  providing  the  desired business  capability,  mission-risk,  performance,  support,  and  for  satisfying the requirement as defined in the Problem Statement.  After an alternative has been selected as a result of the AoA, the Functional Sponsor along with the PM will identify when the previously  generated  “to  be”  processes  will  be  modified  to  accommodate  the  preferred alternative.    The selection of the preferred alternative will be used to update the Problem Statement (PRM/BRM/DOTMLPF-P Implementation Plan) and the BUR certified by the AF DCMO approval.  Note:  Refer to DoDI 5000.02 for requirement to reach IOC within 5 years of MS A or selection of preferred alternative.  5.2.2.4.  Materiel Solution Refinement.  Prior to contracting for the materiel solution the PM  in  conjunction  with  the  Functional  Sponsor  will  take  the  requirements  identified  in the updated Problem Statement (PRM/BRM/DOTMLPF-P Implementation Plan) and the BUR  certified  by  the  AF  DCMO  and  derive  them  into  requirements  captured  in  the System  Requirement  Document  (SRD).    Note:    If  the  preferred  alternative  is  an  IT Service then refer to AFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services for the requirements applicable to  IT  Services.    If  the  preferred  alternative  involves  the  procurement  of  commodities (such as COTS software), and does not involve development or modification activities of a new  capability, the acquisition should be considered for exemption  to  the Acquisition Master  List  (AML)  IAW  AFI  63-101.    If  the  preferred  alternative  is  a  non-materiel solution  or  materiel  alternative  that  does  not  require  program  office  support  then  the decision may be made to stand-down program office support.   5.2.3.  Capability  Build  Strategies.    To  provide  best-value  to  the  DoD  and  deliver  planned business  capabilities  to  the  user  within  desired  Functional  Sponsor  defined  deployment 28 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 schedule, the PM and Functional Sponsor should properly scope and allocate the delivery of planned  business  capabilities  (i.e.,  program  outcomes)  for  the  program.    The  deployable capability  should  also  tie  to  benefits  and/or  specific  performance  measures  or  outcomes.  This approach provides the PM and Functional Sponsor with the ability to deliver high-value business  capabilities  and  flexibility  to  reduce  overall  program  risk  by  creating  more manageable units of work.    5.2.3.1.  Working with the Functional Sponsor the PM will consider an initial capability with basic, militarily useful functionality and a flexible, extensible architecture followed by  architecture builds  scoped to  rapidly deliver  new capability.    Ensure increments or builds  are  scaled  to  be  obtainable  with  an  appropriate  period  of  time  at  an  appropriate cost.  A user requirement(s) can be satisfied by multiple increments with each increment delivering a subset of useful capability or one increment comprised of multiple builds to meet the user requirement(s).   5.2.3.2.  The  PM  needs  to  keep  track  of  cumulative  cost  of  increments  as  they  may eventually exceed the MAIS threshold (even if each increment is at the ACAT III level).  Additionally, if a MAIS has multiple increments, they are all considered MAIS regardless of dollar value.  Reference DoDI 5000.02 for more information.  5.2.3.3.  The  PM  will  ensure  that  the  program  is  structured  so  that  the  program  is  not overwhelmed  with  frequent  milestone  or  deployment  decision  points  and  associated approval reviews.  Multiple activities or build phases may be approved at MS B or later decision points subject to adequate planning, well-defined exit criteria, and demonstrated progress.   However,  each increment should be sufficiently long to  deliver a meaningful capability  increase over  the previous increment.    It  is  important to  avoid the superficial appearance  of  speed  by  ensuring  each  increment  provides  a  militarily  useful  and supportable operational capability.  5.2.4.  Architecture.    The  PM  in  conjunction  with  the  Functional  Sponsor  will  develop  the necessary  architectures  that  align  with  the  Air  Force  Enterprise  Architecture  and  DoD Business  Enterprise  Architecture  (BEA)  to  meet  the  requirements  for  MS  A/B.    Alignment with  the  Business  Enterprise  Architecture  (BEA)  should  begin  as  part  of  the  requirements process and extend into the development of the materiel solution.  The architecture products include  the  program’s  system  as  well  as  its  potential  interfaces  and/or  impacts  to  external systems.    For  systems  that  will  directly  support  and/or  serve  as  an  accountable  property system of record, the PM shall ensure that system requirements comply with DoDI 5000.64, Accountability and Management of DoD Equipment  and Other Accountable Property.  The architectures  must  be  included  in  the  Information  Support  Plan  for  Development  RFP Release; approved at Milestone B.  The PM shall follow the policies and procedures detailed in AFI 33-401, Air Force Architecting.  5.2.5.  Infrastructure  and  Network  Requirements.    Initial  planning  begins  as  support  for  the AoA  to  determine  the  Infrastructure  and  Network  requirements  of  a  number  of  potential alternative  solutions.    Once  the  preferred  alternative  is  selected  the  PM  and  the  Functional Sponsor  will  develop  requirements  that  will  drive  appropriate  and  affordable  infrastructure service  solutions  for  the  selected  program.    The  PM  will  leverage  enterprise  services  and existing  infrastructures  in  order  to  identify  technical  requirements  for  the  materiel  solution.  Technical  requirements  can  be  informed  by  use  cases  and  information  exchange AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 29 environments  that  need  to  interface  with  the  materiel  solution,  and  thus  place  requirements on  the  materiel  solution  implementation.    These  requirements  will  be  refined  into implementable  requirements  for  the  Development  RFP  and  other  providers.    The  PM  shall ensure  that  the  processes  in  AFI  33-115,  Air  Force  Information  Technology  (IT)  Service Management,  are  followed.   The  PM  shall  work  with  PEO  Command,  Control, Communications,  Intelligence  &  Networks  (C3I&N),  who  manages  the  implementation baseline of the AF Network, to determine infrastructure and network capabilities.    5.2.5.1.  Common Computing Environment (CCE).  All new and modernizing (changing configuration  baseline)  IT  applications  shall  utilize  the  Air  Force  CCE.    The  CCE  is provisioned  by  the  PEO  C3I&N  Managed  Services  Office  (MSO).    The  MSO  has established a set of baseline-driven platform and infrastructure services in both physical and virtual hosting environments.  PMs shall follow the processes defined in AFI 33-115 to utilize the CCE.  5.2.5.2.  Enterprise  Software.    The  PM  should  assess  the  DoD  Enterprise  Software Initiative  (DoD  ESI),  Federal  Strategic  Sourcing  Initiative  procurement  vehicles,  and Defense Component-level Enterprise Software Licenses when procuring commercial IT.  Note:  The PM must obtain funds for initial start-up expenses, licenses, servers, and first year of maintenance out of program dollars.  5.2.5.3.  Data  Center  Consolidation.    If  a  PM  intends  to  obligate  funds  for  data  servers, data centers, or the information  systems  technology used therein,  he or she must obtain prior approval from the DoD CIO. The request must be approved by the Air Force CIO.  The PM shall submit requirements for required approvals of data servers and associated IT  using  the  processes  described  in  AFI  33-150,  Management  of  Cyberspace  Support Activities.  5.2.5.4.  Cloud Computing.  PEO C3I&N will act as a technical center to ensure that an application meets the technical requirements to move to a cloud.  PEO C3I&N will assist AF acquisition programs to define requirements and capabilities that can be implemented utilizing  DoD  approved  cloud  offerings.    The  DoD  CIO  released  a  Cloud  Computing Security Requirements Guide (SRG) which outlines the minimum security requirements for the Department when using commercial and internal cloud services.  Refer to AFI 33-115 for more information on cloud computing requirements.  5.2.5.5.  Interoperability.    The  PM  shall  ensure  that  interoperability  certification  is achieved  in  accordance  with  DoD  Instruction  8330.01,  Interoperability  of  Information Technology (IT), Including National Security Systems (NSS) and AFGM2015-33-03, Air Force  Interoperability  &  Supportability of  IT/NSS..   Interoperability considerations will be  documented  in  the  Information  Support  Plan  (ISP),  and  test  requirements  will  be coordinated  with  the  appropriate  agency  (CIO  for  AF,  Joint  Interoperability  Test Command  (JITC)  for  Joint  requirements).Test  considerations  will  be  included  in  test planning  and documented in  the Acquisition Strategy.   Business system  interoperability between business systems in different functional areas should be assessed.  Programs are required to incorporate funding to execute interoperability certification tests by the JITC in their funding profiles in accordance with DoDI 8330.01 and AFGM2015-33-03.  5.2.5.6.  IT  System  Registration.    The  Functional  Sponsor,  Portfolio  Manager,  and  PM shall  ensure  that  the  program  is  registered  in  EITDR  and  eMASS  per  AFI  33-141,  Air 30 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 Force  Information  Technology  Portfolio  Management  and  IT  Investment  Review  and AFI 33-210, Air Force Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Program (AFCAP).   5.2.6.  Cybersecurity.  Initial cybersecurity planning supports the AoA by defining the initial security  considerations,  but  once  the  preferred  solution  is  selected,  the  PM  in  conjunction with  the  Functional  Sponsor  shall  identify  the  cybersecurity  requirements  for  the  program.  This  will  include  implementing  the  processes  detailed  in  the  portfolio  processes,  the cybersecurity  strategy,  determining  the  type  of  Information  Technology,  categorizing  the system,  adversary  cyber  threat  inputs,  identifying  the  system-specific  controls  required  per the Risk Management Framework (RMF), and identifying other cybersecurity considerations.  Cybersecurity  requirements  will  be  captured  in  the  relevant  requirements  and  acquisition documentation and the development RFP.  The PM shall obtain System Owner concurrence that  system  cybersecurity requirements  are  consistent  with  stakeholder requirements.  technical 5.2.6.1.  Risk  Management  Framework  (RMF).    The  PM  in  conjunction  with  the Functional  Sponsor  shall  implement  RMF  to  include  the  system  categorization, continuous monitoring strategy, initial security control selection, and the agreed to list of artifacts  supporting  the  RMF  process.    RMF  activities  should  be  initiated  as  early  as possible in the DoD acquisition process to increase security and decrease cost and build upon  the  Security  Reference  Model  defined  as  part  of  AFMAN  33-402.    The  PM  must ensure the planning and execution of all RMF activities are aligned, integrated with, and supportive  of  the  system  acquisition  process.    The  RMF  shall  be  implemented  in accordance  with  DoDI  8510.01,  Risk  Management  Framework  (RMF)  for  DoD Information  Technology  (IT),  and  AFI  33-210.    For  more  information  on  integrating RMF  reference, the Cybersecurity  Risk  Management  Framework  (RMF)  into  the  System  Acquisition Lifecycle.  the  DoD  Program  Manager’s  Guidebook  for  Integrating 5.2.6.2.  Data  Protection.    PMs  in  conjunction  with  the  Functional  Sponsor  of  AF  DBS systems (including those supported through contracts with external sources) that collect, maintain,  use,  or  disseminate  data  must  protect  against  disclosure  to  non-approved sources while meeting the organization’s record keeping needs.  Unclassified Controlled Technical Information will be protected IAW DFARS 204.73 and AFI 61-204.  5.2.6.3.  Privacy.    The  PM  in  conjunction  with  the  Functional  Sponsor  shall  ensure privacy requirements and risk management controls are identified that protect privacy act and personally identifiable information in accordance with DoD 5400.11-R, DoD Privacy Program and AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program.  5.2.7.  Program  Protection  Planning.    Initial  planning  for  program  protection  begins  as support  for  the  AoA  by  defining  the  initial  program  protection  considerations  and  builds upon the Security Reference Model defined as part of AFMAN 33-402.  Once the preferred solution  is  selected,  the  PM  shall  identify  the  program  protection  requirements  for  the program.    The  PM  will  implement  the  portfolio-level  processes  and  methodologies  and define  program-specific  information  including  critical  program  information,  software assurance, and implement Trusted Systems and Network procedures.  Program-specific items shall be documented.  Refer to AFPAM 63-113, Program Protection Planning for Life Cycle Management,  DoDI  5200.44,  Protection  of  Mission  Critical  Functions  to  Achieve  Trusted AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 31 Systems  and  Networks  (TSN),  and  DoDI  5200.39,  Critical  Program  Information  (CPI) Identification and Protection Within Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) for more information.  5.2.7.1.  Software  Assurance  (SwA).    The  PM  shall  identify  how  software  will  be designed and tested to assure protection of critical functionality, identify how software of unknown  pedigree  (i.e.,  software  from  sources  buried  in  the  supply  chain)  will  be protected and tested/vetted, and define the software assurance countermeasures that will be implemented.    5.2.7.2.  Trusted  Systems  and  Networks  (TSN).    The  PM  shall  implement  TSN requirements  IAW  DoDI  5200.44,  if  the  system  is  determined  to  be  NSS,  has  a  high impact  to  loss  of  confidentiality,  integrity  or  availability,  or  other  DoD  information systems that the SAE or CIO determines to be critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions.    5.2.7.3.  Acquisition Intelligence Support.  Acquisition Intelligence products and services can be provided through the supporting Senior Intelligence Officer. Refer to AFI 63-101 for more information.    The  PM  shall  implement  the  portfolio-level  processes  and 5.2.8.  Test  Planning. methodologies  defined  in  the  Portfolio  TEMP  and  define  program  specific  information including the system critical  technical  parameters (CTP) and evaluation  framework prior to development  of  the  materiel  solution.        Program-specific  information  will  be  documented and shall identify the necessary plans needed to confirm the system’s technical requirements to  include  cybersecurity.   The  portfolio  process  should  identify  shared  resources, organizations, processes, and evaluation approaches that are not program specific.  Refer to AFI 99-103 for more information on test planning and execution.  Note:  DBS programs on OSD oversight require a standalone TEMP.  5.2.8.1.  Critical  Technical  Parameters.    The  PM  shall  ensure  CTPs  are  measurable  and testable,  traceable  to  key  system  requirements  and  architectures,  and  help  the  PM translate CTPs into system requirements for development and integration.  CTPs measure critical  system  characteristics  that,  when  achieved,  enable  the  attainment  of  desired operational  performance  capabilities.    While  not  user  requirements,  CTPs  are  technical measures  derived  from  desired  user  capabilities.    CTPs  must  reflect  the  system’s definition  and  design  for  key  elements  and  should  be  correlated  to  Critical  Operational Issues  (COI)  and  OT&E  test  objectives  (i.e.,  Measures  of  Effectiveness  (MOE), Measures of Suitability (MOS), and Measures of Performance (MOP).  5.2.8.2.  Development  Evaluation  Framework.    The  PM  shall  develop  a  development evaluation framework that shows the correlation between the Critical Operational Issues (COI), key requirements (Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and Key System Attributes (KSA), key test measures (CTPs, MOEs, MOSs, and MOPs), planned test methods, and test resources, facilities, or infrastructure needs.  5.2.9.  Product Support.  Product support planning begins with the AoA which describes the notional  high-level  product  support  and  maintenance  concepts  to  be  used  for  a  number  of potential alternative solutions.  Once the preferred solution has been selected these concepts are expanded into a strategy for the entire program based on the technology and acquisition 32 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 approach.  The PM in conjunction with the Functional Sponsor shall implement the portfolio-level  processes  and  methodologies  and  define  program-specific  information  including requirements;  system  performance  indicators  or  other  key  drivers  and  key  supportability requirements  included  in  the  system  and  design  specifications.    Portfolio  methodologies should  include  assessments;  support  strategy;  performance-based  agreements;  key  metrics, the  view  of  sustainment  contracts,  and  the  major  product  support  elements  and plan/agreement  for  acquiring  and  deployment  the  preferred  solution.    These  activities  will inform  the  topics  addressed  in  product  support  planning.    Product  support  activities  and requirements are further documented in Chapter 7.  5.2.9.1.  Cyber  Product  Support  Considerations.    The  PM  shall  ensure  that  product support planning is sufficient for the system to implement all actions required by Cyber C2  orders  directing  NetOps  Services  (e.g.  Vulnerability  Management)  and  report compliance/non-compliance  according  to  the  orders  and  applicable  methods  and procedures for NetOps Services.  5.2.9.2.  Product Support BCA.  When applicable, the PM will conduct a Product Support BCA in accordance with AFI 63-101/20-101.  5.2.10.  Funding and Cost Estimating.  Once the alternative is selected, the PM will prepare a Funding  Profile  that  documents  the  proposed  overall  strategy  for  funding  the  program.  Defining  a  Funding  Profile  is  essential  for  ensuring  program  stability  over  its  planned lifecycle and for providing a disciplined approach for PMs to execute their programs within cost  and  available  funding.    The  Functional  Sponsor  is  ultimately  responsible  for  ensuring that  funding  is  identified  and  obtained.    The  Functional  Sponsor  is  also  responsible  for ensuring funds are certified IAW 10 USC 2222.  5.2.10.1.  Cost Estimates.  A Program Office Estimate (POE) is required for all DBS and shall be completed annually with the concurrence of the life cycle management, nuclear warfare, and sustainment center (if required) financial management cost organization.  If the  DBS  is  an  ACAT  IA  program,  the  PM  shall  also  prepare  a  Cost  Analysis Requirements Description in accordance with DoDI 5000.02, DoDI 5000.73, and AFI 65-508,  and  support Independent  Cost  Estimate  and Service/Component  Cost  Position.    ACAT  I  DBS  programs  are  required  to  submit  a Service/Component Cost Position for CCA.  All other DBS programs submit a Life Cycle Cost  Estimate for CCA.   Refer to  AFI 65-508, Cost  Analysis Guidance and Procedures for details.    the  development  of the 5.2.10.2.  Economic Analysis.  The PM shall conduct an economic analysis in accordance with AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis.  5.2.11.  Problem Statement Update and Approval.  Once the preferred alternative is selected, the  Functional  Sponsor  will  update  the  Problem  Statement  (PRM/BRM/DOTMLPF-P Implementation Plan) and the BUR certified by the AF DCMO. This action will precede the Development  RFP  Release  Decision  Point  and  provides  a  basis  for  preliminary  activities supporting the Development RFP that will occur prior to Milestone B unless waived by the MDA.    5.3.  Development  RFP  Development  and  Decision.    The  PM  should  finish  assessing infrastructure  and  network,  cybersecurity,  program  protection,  test,  and  product  support AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 33 requirements for the program and refine them into technical requirements for the RFP.  The RFP shall be informed by the updated Acquisition Strategy and must convey a clear understanding of the government’s needs to industry.   5.3.1.  Network  Centric  Solutions  (NETCENTS).    The  NETCENTS  contracts  are  the mandatory  source  for  all  AF  units  purchasing  IT  products  and  solutions  that  fall  under  the scope of the NETCENTS contract, guidance for PMs is contained in AFI 63-101/20-101.   5.3.2.  Information  Technology  Asset  Management.    The  PM  should  review  AFMAN  33-153, Information Technology Asset Management (ITAM), for requirements on IT Hardware and  Software  Asset  Management,  including  accounting,  ordering,  and  mandatory  use contract vehicles associated with IT assets.   5.3.3.  Development RFP Release Decision Point.  This decision point authorizes the release of the RFP(s) for the next phase.  The purpose is to have the MDA review and approve the Acquisition  Strategy  and  authorize  the  release  of  the  RFP(s)  so  evaluation  can  begin  while the  remaining  activities  are  being  completed.    The  documentation  required  for  the Development  RFP  Release  Decision  Point  is  listed  in  Table  5.2.    Note:  Approval  authority for documentation is contained in Section 1.4 and MS A/B documentation drafts are required for the Development RFP release decision.  Table 5.2.  Development RFP Documentation.  Document Acquisition Strategy Draft RFP Responsible Activity Program Manager Program Manager Analysis of Alternatives Problem Statement Functional Sponsor Functional Sponsor Notes: The Acquisition Strategy is approved by the MDA at each milestone or relevant decision point The content in the RFP is organized in such a manner to clearly define the scope of products and services for the Increment and allow the Government to effectively evaluate proposals. The PM leads the development of the SRD.  The requirements from the BUR are captured in the SRD for inclusion in the RFP. Refer to DoDI 5000.02 for AoA requirements. Once the preferred alternative is selected, the Functional Sponsor will update the Problem Statement (PRM/BRM/DOTMLPF-P Implementation Plan) and the BUR certified by the AF DCMO 5.3.4.  Development  RFP  Release  Decision  Point  Exit.    Decisions  resulting  from  the Development RFP Release Decision Point will be documented in an ADM.  The ADM will document specific criteria required for Milestone A/B approval including needed test actions, affordability requirements, and funding requirements.  5.4.  MS  A/B.   This  milestone  provides  authorization  to  enter  into  Development  and Deployment  and  to  award  contracts  for  Development  and  Deployment.  It  also  commits  the required  investment  resources  to  the  program.  Many  requirements  for  this  milestone  should  be 34 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 satisfied by the Development RFP Release Decision  Point;  however, if any significant  changes have  occurred,  or  if  additional  information  not  available  at  the  Development  RFP  Release Decision  Point  could  impact  this  decision,  it  must  be  provided  at  the  Milestone  A/B.  The documentation  required  for  MS  A/B  is  listed  in  Table  5.3.    Note:  Approval  authority  for documentation is contained in Section 1.4.  The Development RFP draft documentation shall be finalized  for  this  decision  point.    Every  program  will  identify  the  tailoring  from  the  required Portfolio Documents in  Table 3.1.  All  programs  should review the documentation identified in Table 3.2 and 3.3 for applicability.  Table 5.3.  MS A/B Documentation.

Purpose.    This  phase  demonstrates  that  the  materiel  solution  for  the  increment  has  been designed,  configured,  developed,  and  tested  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  approved Acquisition Strategy, and to limit risk by providing the capability to a limited number of users or providing the user with a mature and tested (sub-element of the overall incremental) capability.  OT&E shall determine the operational effectiveness and suitability of the system.  The expected outcomes and outputs for the phase are summarized in Table 6.1.  Table 6.1.  Phase Expected Outcomes and Outputs.  Expected Outcomes and Outputs 1)  Completion of developmental testing with the appropriate Test Agency / Organization according to the pre-established procedures identified in the Portfolio TEMP.  Demonstrating that the capability or increment of capability has been designed, configured, developed, and tested in accordance with the test plan and the MS A/B ADM.Note:  DBS programs on OSD oversight require a standalone TEMP 2)  Completion of operational testing resulting in an operationally tested capability that meets the MDA-approved schedule and that includes capabilities that are secure, suitable, operationally useful, and accepted by the user.  All programs that result in a FDD or limited deployment decision require an appropriate type of operational testing supported by sufficient independent evaluation to inform that decision. 3)  Making preparations for sustaining the capability (continuing product support planning begun in previous phases) 4)  Integrating the DOT_LPF-P aspects of the solution, as appropriate 5)  Authority to Operate the system IAW AFI 33-210 and DoDI 8510.01 6)  The Functional Sponsor’s declaration of Initial Operational Capability (IOC).Note:IOC criteria will be provided by the Functional Sponsor and documented in the APB at MS A/B 6.2.  Phase  Activities  and  Considerations.    Activities  during  this  phase  will  result  in  the successful completion of the work required to reach Full Deployment.  The activities during this phase are the shared responsibility of the PM and the Functional Sponsor.  A general sequence for phase activities is contained in Figure. 6.1.  AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 37 Figure 6.1.  Development and Deployment Activities.   6.2.1.  Test Execution.  The test community shall test and evaluate the delivered capability to determine if it adheres to  the outcomes defined and documented.  The test planning for the program  shall  consider  all  aspects  of  the  system  requirements  to  include  security, interoperability, as well as performance.  Prior to conducting test activities refer to AFI 33-210 to ensure proper cybersecurity authorizations have been attained.  6.2.1.1.  For MAIS, developmental testing shall be conducted in accordance with the test plan, as documented, and approved by the DASD(DT&E).  Operational  testing shall be conducted in accordance with the Operational Test Plan approved by the DOT&E.  6.2.1.2.  For  ACAT  III  programs,  testing  may  be  conducted  using  the  processes  and procedures, resources, and methodologies described in the Portfolio Test and Evaluation Master Plan.  The PM should identify how those processes will be used to execute testing to assess the CTPs.    6.2.1.3.  For  IT  with  joint,  multinational,  and  interagency  interoperability  requirements,  PMs  must  coordinate  with  JITC  in  the  review  of  IT  developmental  and  operational  test plans  to  gain  as  much  interoperability  test  data  from  those  events  as  possible. Coordination  is  accomplished  through  the  Air  Force  Interoperability  Steering  Group (ISG) Representative.  6.2.2.  Limited  Deployment.    A  Limited  Deployment  Decision  may  be  conducted  for  each build  within  an  increment  of  capability.    Each  increment  may  have  several  limited deployments; each deployment will result from a specific build and provide the user with a mature  and  tested  sub-element  of  the  overall  incremental  capability.  Several  builds  and deployments will typically be necessary to satisfy approved requirements for an increment of capability. The PM and Functional Sponsor can make Limited Deployment Decisions if the delegation of authority is documented and approved by the MDA in the MS A/B ADM.  38 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 6.2.2.1.  Limited Deploment Decision CCA Review.  The PM can bundle all the Limited Deployment Decision CCA reviews into one CCA review in consultation with SAF/A6.  This  means  that  if  the  program  has  a  stable  schedule  and  plans  for  multiple  Limited Deployment  Decisions,  the  PM  can  submit  one  CCA  review  package  that  will  be reviewed for all identified Limited Deployment Decisions.    6.2.2.2.  Limited  Deployment  Operational  Testing.    Limited  Deployments  must  be supported  by  the  appropriate  level  of  OT&E.  DBS  may  utilize  an  Operational  Utility Evaluation  or  Operational  Assessment  IAW  AFI  99-103  for  their  Limited  Deployment events.    OUEs  may  be  used  to  support  operational  decisions  (e.g.,  deploying  a  system with  less  than  full  capability,  to  include  but  not  limited  to  integrated  testing  of  releases and increments of IT capabilities).  6.2.2.3.  Limited  Deployment  Decisions  for  Software-intensive  programs.    Limited Deployments  that  have  joint  interfaces  will  be  assessed  for  interoperability  test assessments (vice) certifications by the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC). This coordination will be accomplished through the Air Force Interoperability Steering Group (ISG) Representative.  6.2.3.  DOT_LPF-P Execution.  The Functional Sponsor in parallel with the PM deployment of the materiel solution ensures the DOT_LPF-P elements are completed to complement the deployment schedule.    6.2.4.  Operational Testing.  The PM will manage the program to ensure system readiness for OT&E and that OT&E will provide sufficient data to assess system operational effectiveness, suitability, and survivability.  Functional Sponsor, informed by dedicated operational testing results  and  DOT&E  recommendations  (for  DBS  on  the  OT&E  oversight  list),  will  verify capability requirements are met prior to the Full Deployment Decision.  The PM will track, evaluate, and take appropriate actions to resolve deficiency reports (DR).  For DBS that have a  dedicated  phase  of  OT&E  supporting  a  deployment  decision,  an  OT&E  readiness certification  will  be  conducted  IAW  AFMAN  63-119  and  AFI  99-103.    Once  capability requirements have been verified, the PM will move towards Full Deployment.    6.2.5.  Product Support Implementation.  The PM shall ensure that lifecycle support is ready to  implement  as it was defined in  planning documents for the program  and update the  Life Cycle  Sustainment  Plan  (LCSP)  program  unique  factors.  Refer  to  AFI  63-101/20-101  for product support considerations.  6.2.5.1.  The PM works with  end-users to  ensure they are appropriately trained in  using the  materiel  solution  and  that  issues  are  identified  and  addressed  expediently  prior  to reaching IOC.  6.2.5.2.  The PM shall ensure that the program has the necessary resources, funding, and capability  to  implement  information  assurance  and  program  protection  requirements throughout the program life cycle.  This includes having a structure in place to re-accredit the system according to the Risk Management Framework and update the system to meet new technical standards and protocols.  6.3.  Full Deployment  Decision (FDD).    The MDA will conduct a review to assess the results of OT&E and Limited Deployment, and determine whether or not to approve proceeding to Full Deployment.  Continuing into Full Deployment requires acceptable performance and reliability, AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 39 and  the  establishment  of  adequate  sustainment  and  support  systems.    The  Functional  Sponsor should  ensure  all  elements  of  the  solution  described  in  the  Problem  Statement,  BUR,  and Acquisition  Strategy  are  ready  to  be  implemented  in  the  operational  environment.    The documentation  required  for  FDD  is  listed  in  Table  6.2.    Note:  approval  authority  for documentation  is  contained  in  Table  3.1-4.    ACAT  I  programs  may  require  additional documentation  identified  in  Table  3.2.    Every  program  will  identify  the  tailoring  from  the required  Portfolio  Documents  in  Table  3.1.    All  programs  should  review  the  documentation identified in Table 3.2 and 3.3 for applicability.  Table 6.2.  FDD Documentation.  Document Portfolio Documents Acquisition Strategy Responsible Activity PEO/Program Manager Program Manager Clinger-Cohen Act (CCA) Compliance Cybersecurity Strategy Economic Analysis Program Manager Program Manager Program Manager Information Support Plan DBC Certification PIR Plan Program Manager Functional Sponsor Functional Sponsor / Program Manager Notes: Every program will identify the tailoring from the required Portfolio Documents in Table 3.1. The Acquisition Strategy is approved by the MDA at each milestone or relevant decision point. Procedures are contained in AFMAN 33-407 Programs should document security levels of the program.  Refer to DoDI 5000.02, DoDI 8500.01, and AFI 33-210 for more information Procedures and Applicability are in AFI 65-501 and AFMAN 65-506.  SAF/FMC has developed a tailored Economic Analysis to assist smaller DBS programs Procedures are documented in AFGM 2015-33-03, DoDI 5000.02, and DoDI 8330.01 Approval memorandum to obligate funds Requirements are contained in AFI 63-101/20-101 and AFMAN 33-407 6.3.1.  FDD  Exit.    The  decision  to  proceed  into  full  deployment  will  be  documented  in  an ADM.   40 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 Chapter 7 FULL DEPLOYMENT AND OPERATIONS AND SUSTAINMENT  7.1.  Purpose.    This  phase  brings  together  training  with  technical  support  to  implement  the capability to the entire user community described in the Acquisition Strategy in order to maintain materiel  readiness,  provide  operational  support  (e.g.,  help  desk),  monitor  performance,  and sustain the capability in the most cost-effective manner possible over its total lifecycle. The end of  this  phase  is  reached  with  the  disposal  of  the  capability  when  it  has  reached  the  end  of  its useful life. The expected outcomes and outputs for the phase are summarized in Table 7.1.  Table 7.1.  Phase Expected Outcomes and Outputs.  Expected Outcomes and Outputs 1)  Functional Sponsor schedules and conducts a Post Implementation review 2)  Support to users, until disposal of the capability 3)  Requirements inputs for next increment that may impact the Acquisition Strategy 4)  Implementation of required configuration changes and technical orders to maintain capability and maintain the technical baseline 5)  Updates to program processes including product support, systems engineering, program protection, and cybersecurity 6)  Maintaining the systems ATO IAW the Risk Management Framework 7)  Testing activities required for programs in sustainment undergoing modification as part of each program’s lifecycle. 7.2.  Phase  Activities  and  Considerations.    Activities  during  this  phase  will  result  in  the remaining production or deployment of the product leading to Full Deployment.   Activities will ensure the program meets materiel readiness and operational support performance requirements and sustains  the system  in  the most cost-effective manner over its total  lifecycle. The planning for  this  phase  shall  have  begun  prior  to  Dev  RFP  and  will  have  been  updated  continuously throughout the programs useful life.  AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 41 Figure 7.1.  Deployment and Operations and Sustainment Activities.   7.2.1.  Full  Deployment.    The  Functional  Sponsor  declares  Full  Deployment  (FD)  when  all capability requirements are in place.  7.2.2.  Performance Measures and Lessons Learned.  As the system is deployed, the PM and Functional Sponsor should pay attention to the performance measures during deployment, as these  should  be  an  indicator  of  potential  issues  and  will  inform  successive  increments.  Additionally, the PM and Functional Sponsor should document lessons learned to understand what  worked  and  what  did  not  regarding  the  solution’s  quality  and  performance.    PEOs should collect the lessons learned to apply to future efforts, these lessons can result in general program improvement, reduced risk, increased probability of future successes, and reduce the potential for future failures.   7.2.3.  Post  Implementation Reviews (PIR).  PIRs report the degree to  which DOTMLPF-P changes  have  achieved  the  established  measures  of  effectiveness  and  efficiencies  for  the desired  capability;  evaluate  systems  and  increments  to  ensure  positive  ROI  and  decide whether  continuation,  modification,  or  termination  of  the  systems  is  necessary  to  meet mission requirements; and document lessons learned from the PIR. If the PIR overlaps with Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation, the sponsor should coordinate planning of both events for efficiency.  PIRs should be submitted to the AF CIO for approval.  Results of the PIR shall be reported to SAF/MG.  7.2.4.  Configuration Control.  The PM shall maintain configuration control of the system by complying with the portfolio processes dictated in the portfolio SEP.  The portfolio processes shall identify enterprise-level activities including the strategy, configuration process, boards, and tools that allow the program to integrate across multiple increments and projects on the program  and  external  systems.    Automated  tools  can  be  utilized  that  allow  continuous integration  and  testing,  but  should  not  dictate  unnecessary  complexity  in  the  configuration process.    Just  like  any  program,  the  PM  should  ensure  structure  and  rigor  when  managing 42 AFMAN63-144  31 MARCH 2016 changes  to  baselines,  designs,  engineering,  and  program  documentation.    The  PM  is responsible for maintaining all project documentation in the required registries.  7.2.5.  Cybersecurity Management.  After the system is approved and fielded for operational use, effectiveness of the program’s cybersecurity capabilities is monitored in accordance with the AO approved system-level continuous monitoring strategy.  The system-level continuous monitoring strategy must maintain conformance to all applicable published DoD enterprise-level  or  Air  Force  continuous  monitoring  strategies.    Any  change  to  the  system,  its environment  (to  include  adversary  cyber  threat),  or  its  use  has  the  potential  to  increase  or decrease  risk;  therefore,  a  cybersecurity  risk  assessment  is  necessary  to  determine  the  risk level  associated  with  changes.   Results  of  continuous  monitoring  and  subsequent  cybersecurity  risk  assessments  may  necessitate  changes  to  the  system  to  mitigate  newly identified, and unacceptable risk; therefore, the PM must update the Cybersecurity Strategy and indicate in  the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) how and when those changes will  be  implemented.  The  PM  may  need  to  coordinate  with  organizations  outside  the (Program Management Office) PMO to ensure actions identified in the POA&M are feasible and are ultimately implemented to the satisfaction of the user, program office and authorizing official.  Refer to DoDI 8510.01, AFI 33-210, and AFPAM 63-113 for more information.   7.2.6.  Product  Support.    Product  support  management  for  DBS  includes  executing  the processes  identified  in  the  portfolio  LCSP  and  any  program  unique  factors  to  the  program.  This  should  address  the  required  help  desk  support,  IT  support  contracts,  license managements, configuration management processes, and other sustainment activities that are captured in the Product Support Elements.  7.2.7.  Maintenance  Actions.    The  correction  of  discovered  faults,  keeping  a  computer program usable in a changed software environment, or improving its processing performance or  maintainability  without  adding  new  capability  should  be  done  IAW  the  portfolio processes.  7.2.8.  Modifications.  Functional Sponsor requirements that add new capability, change the functional  baseline,  or  significantly  increase  capability  will  be  documented  in  a  new  or updated  Problem  Statement  per  AFMAN  33-402.    Major  modifications  may  necessitate  a new  AFMAN  33-402  cycle  with  a  re-engineering  of  the  business  processes.    Permanent modifications  are  normally  ACAT  programs  and  should  comply  with  guidance  in  this AFMAN.  7.3.  FD and O&S Exit.   The PM and Functional Sponsor should consider the requirements to retain/transfer data, dispose of equipment, and privacy information IAW with portfolio processes to dispose of the system.
