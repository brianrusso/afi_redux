QTP4Y0X2-5 05 May 2016 DENTAL LABORATORY SPECIALTY Volume 5. Medical Material 381st Training Squadron 2931 Harney Road Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 INTRODUCTION Volume 5, Medical Material, Qualification Training Package (QTP) contains modules on issue and turn-in of supplies and equipment, maintaining stock levels, storing dangerous and flammable items, storing and turning-in disposable items for destruction, and aiding in preparation of budget and financial requirements.  This QTP is designed to enhance 5- and 7-skill level on-the-job training (OJT) of dental laboratory personnel.  Training references listed in each module may be used to compliment training.  All QTPs are intended to be used by trainees, trainers, supervisors, and task certifiers.  Before initiating any training you should review your responsibilities as a supervisor/trainer for conducting OJT per AFI 36-2201, Chapter 6, Air Force Training Program On-The-Job Training Administration.   QTPs are instructional packages designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field training.  Once you begin upgrade training you are required to use the QTPs.  QTPs provide continuity to the trainee’s upgrade training and are divided into the following volumes:  1) General Dental Laboratory Experience; 2) Fixed Prosthodontics; 3) Treatment and Orthodontic Appliances, Complete and Removable Dental Prostheses; 4) Dental Laboratory Administration; 5) Medical Material; and 6) Supervision and Training.  The QTP modules were designed to assistyou in preparing for and conducting training.  Each module segments the major tasks into teachable elements.  Your goal is to provide enough training and guidance so trainees can do all task related steps, without assistance and produce an appliance or prosthesis that meets local requirements and fabrication standards for speed and accuracy.  QTPs also aid OJT task certifiers in evaluating the trainee’s demonstrated performance.  If you have local training requirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop “steps in performance” and “performance checklists” that support and standardize those tasks.   When you are satisfied the trainee meets standards, as prescribed in the QTP performance checklist, you must document each task completion in the QTP tab.  If a person is being recertified on a task that is supported by a QTP you must use that module to complete the recertification process.  Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then, evaluating performance.  Your local steps in performance may vary from the method listed in the QTP module.  If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to the first half of each module, (i.e. steps in task performance); however, the “performance checklist” is considered a standard and cannot be altered.  You may train each QTP volume/module in any sequence; however, when conducting training use an organized and methodical approach.  This will reduce your training time and enhance your efforts. 2 Introduction_________________________________________________________________ii For effective use of this QTP, conduct training in the following manner: 1. Review the procedures in each module with the trainee.2. Direct the trainee to review the training references listed to prepare for taskperformance.3. Review the steps in task performance with the trainee, allowing enough time toadequately train each step (some modules may take longer to teach).4. Evaluate the trainee’s work at each critical step using the performance checklistat this point will be helpful.5. Evaluate the trainee’s performance and provide feedback on any area forimprovement.6. Finally, when the trainee has successfully completed the task you mustdocument the STS.  It the trainee does not accomplish the module, conductfollow-up instruction until the trainee successfully completes the task.The QTP project goal of the 381st Training Squadron, Fort Sam Houston TX, is to publish a useable document for trainers and trainees.  You are encouraged to write-in changes or revisions to the QTPs.  A corrections/improvements letter is located on the last page of each QTP volume.  You may choose to call in your recommendations to DSN 420-1950 or FAX DSN/Commercial 420-1950 or (210) 808-1950 or email the author at daniel.stellabotte.mil@mail.mil.
