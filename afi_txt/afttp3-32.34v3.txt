Overview.  Force  Protection  (FP)  is  critical  to  the  Air  Force’s  ability  to perform  its  worldwide  mission  and  is  a  top  priority  for  commanders.  It  is  a fundamental principle of military operations as a way of ensuring survivability of  forces.  Commanders  at  all  levels  are  responsible  for  protecting  Air  Force people and warfighting resources. However, all Airmen are also responsible for FP  and  need  to  be  prepared,  trained,  and  equipped  to  protect  and  defend operations and assets. This publication provides guidance to civil engineers (CE) on implementing FP measures in the expeditionary environment.  Many of the references listed throughout this publication are For Official Use Only (FOUO) publications. CE planners maintain copies of these publications and ensure they are available throughout all phases of expeditionary operations.    1.2.  Scope.  The  information  in  this  AFTTP  relates  to  tactics,  techniques,  and procedures (TTPs) used by civil engineers in supporting precepts outlined in Air Force  Doctrine  Annex  (AFDA)  3-34,  Engineer  Operations.  It  also  supports implementation of Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness, and AFI 10-210, Prime BEEF Program.   1.3.  Force  Protection  Defined.  Joint  Publication  (JP)  1-02,  Department  of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, defines FP as “Preventive measures  taken  to  mitigate  hostile  actions  against  Department  of  Defense personnel  (to  include  family  members),  resources,  facilities,  and  critical information.” Force protection does not include actions to defeat the enemy or protect  against  accidents,  weather  or  disease.  By  comparison,  North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) doctrine explains that the operational environment “may  have  no  discernable  front-line  or  rear  area  and  an  adversary  may  be expected  to  target  Allied  vulnerabilities  anywhere  with  a  wide  range  of capabilities.”  Consequently,  NATO  includes  all  operations  and  activities  as potential vulnerabilities under FP. The AF definition of FP covers natural and manmade threats. In Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-245, Antiterrorism (AT), the definition includes an “integrated approach that requires actions to both defeat the enemy and protect against hazards such as accidents, weather, disease, and natural disasters.” The complete definitions are shown in Attachment 1.                                                                         7  1.4. Force Protection Doctrine. For  much of its existence, the  Air Force  has been able to rely on the US Army when necessary, for standoff security. In fact, in  1985  the  Chiefs  of  Staff  of  the  Air  Force  and  Army  signed  Joint  Security Agreement  8  which  specified  that  the  Army  would  provide  ground  defense outside  the  perimeter  of  Air  Force  bases.  However,  several  subsequent  joint exercises, as well as experience in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, showed  this  arrangement  was  impractical.  The  formal  agreement  remained  in effect  until  2005,  at  which  time  Joint  Publication  3-10,  Joint  Security Operations  in  Theater,  codified  that  the  Air  Force  would  defend  its  own  air bases.   1.4.1. Additionally, for most of the Cold War Air Force doctrine was primarily based on the expectation that expeditionary bases would be located in a rear area where  the  threat  would  be  greatly  reduced.  In  reality,  during  recent  conflicts (especially in Iraq and Afghanistan) many bases were located in urban areas and the perimeter of the base represented the line of contact with the enemy.   1.4.2. Air Force Doctrine Annex (AFDA) 3-10, Force Protection, states that FP is achieved through the successful execution of three related but distinct lines of effort:  integrated  defense,  emergency  management,  and  the  critical  asset  risk management  program  (formerly  known  as  the  critical  infrastructure  program [CIP]).  These  lines  of  effort  are  reviewed  in  the  following  paragraphs.  The purpose is to integrate these  capabilities and achieve  the desired FP effects of detect,  deter,  preempt,  negate,  and  mitigate.  AFDA  3-10  also  states  that  the specific  and  pivotal  role  of  civil  engineers  is  to  “design  physical  security improvements, provide planning, training, and response capabilities to deal with FP-related  incidents,  and  provide  explosive  ordnance  disposal  capabilities.”  It describes three levels of FP threat (Table 1.1). Keep in mind that these threats may not occur in any specific sequence or may not even appear to be related.   Table 1.1. Force Protection Threat Levels.  Level I Threats: Include enemy agents, sympathizers, partisans, and terrorists whose primary missions include espionage, sabotage, and subversion. Level II Threats: Small-scale tactical forces conducting unconventional or hit and  run  attacks;  may  include  significant  standoff  weapons  such  as  mortars,  8 rockets, and rocket propelled grenades.  Level  III  Threats:  Large  ground  operations;  airborne,  heliborne,  and amphibious  operations;  air  and  missile  attacks  with  little  warning;  operations having the capability of projecting combat power by air, land, and sea anywhere into the operational area.  1.5.  Integrated  Defense  (ID).  Effective  ID  helps  ensure  effective  FP.  As mentioned earlier, ID is an AF-wide responsibility and is conducted worldwide, from  mature  theaters  to  austere  regions.  Regardless  of  location,  forces conducting  ID  employ  the  basic  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  (TTPs)  as those  employed  at  home  station  during  day-to-day  operations.  As  specific threats to base personnel and resources evolve, ID forces adjust TTPs to counter the threat. Adjustments to operating procedures are based on the specific threat to operations; the dynamics of operating in an international environment or the way ID efforts collaborate with joint, combined, civilian, and host nation forces. ID is discussed in broader detail in Chapter 5. For additional information on ID see AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.  1.6.  Emergency  Management  (EM).  The  protection  of  AF  personnel  and resources  on  AF  installations  is  essential  to  ensure  successful  AF  operations. The AF EM Program addresses activities across the all-hazards physical threat environment  at  Continental  United  States  (CONUS)  and  Outside  Continental United  States  (OCONUS)  home  station  or  expeditionary  locations  to  support overall  FP.  The  primary  mission  of  the  AF  EM  Program  is  to  save  lives; minimize the loss or degradation of resources; and continue, sustain, and restore operational  capability  in  an  all-hazards  physical  threat  environment  at  AF installations worldwide. The ancillary missions are to support homeland defense and  civil  support  operations  and  to  provide  support  to  civil  and  host  nation authorities according to DOD directives and through the appropriate combatant command (CCMD).  1.6.1.  Air  Force  Incident  Management  System  (AFIMS).  EM  supports protection  of  personnel  and  resources  through  integration  of  installation preparedness,  response,  and  recovery  programs  aimed  toward  reducing  the impact  of  these  events  on  the  installation;  prepares  for  risks  that  cannot  be eliminated; and prescribes actions required to deal with consequences of actual events  and  to  recover  from  those  events  using  AFIMS.  See  AFI  10-2501,  Air                                  9 Force  Emergency  Management  (EM)  Program  Planning  and  Operations  for more information on the IEM program.  1.7.  Critical  Asset  Risk  Management  (CARM)  Program.  Operations  in support  of  the  National  Military  Strategy  are  dependent  on  globally  linked physical and cyber infrastructures (US and  foreign, public  and private  sector). CARM  interconnects infrastructures,  while improving capabilities and  mission effectiveness,  also  decreasing  vulnerabilities  due  to  potential  human  error failures  during  natural  disasters  or  intentional  attack.  The  mission  of  the  AF CARM  Program  is  to  enhance  risk  management  decision-making  and  ensure that  AF  critical  infrastructure  is  available  to  support  CCMD  and  AF  mission requirements in an all-threat and all-hazard environment. This risk management approach supports AF prioritization of scarce resources, focusing on the greatest risk  based  on  assessed  criticality,  vulnerability,  threats,  and  hazards.  For additional  information  on  the  critical  infrastructure  program,  see  Air  Force Policy  Directive  (AFPD)  10-24,  Air  Force  Critical  Infrastructure  Program (CIP).  1.8.  Force  Protection  Effects.  FP  effects  are  designed  to  prevent  attacks  on DOD assets and interests and minimize the effect of attacks. It is unrealistic to assume  every  DOD  asset  can  be  protected.  For  this  reason,  plans  and preparations to recover  from  an attack are focused on enabling the  mission to continue  and  restoring  confidence  within  the  unit  and  throughout  the  local population. FP efforts conserve the AF’s fighting potential by safeguarding its forces and mission capability through achievement of predetermined effects. In all  circumstances,  commanders  tailor  resources  and  capabilities  to  achieve,  at minimum, the following FP effects:  1.8.1. Deter. Develop measures to discourage adversarial actions by creating the perception  of  the  existence  of  a  credible  threat  of  unacceptable  counteraction. Potential  adversaries  must  perceive  the  AF  has  the  capability  to  conduct  and sustain  offensive  and  defensive  operations.  Measures  civil  engineers  can  take include  placing  barriers  and  roadblocks,  strategically  locating  assets,  and ensuring sufficient standoff to reduce the chances of an attack.  1.8.2. Detect. Develop measures to identify the presence of an object or an event of  possible  military  interest,  whether  a  threat  or  hazard.  Detection  may  arise                                       10 through civil engineer reconnaissance and observation of the operational area or through deductions made following an analysis of the operational area.  1.8.3.  Preempt.  Once  evidence  indicating  an  imminent  enemy  attack  is determined, rapid actions are initiated to respond and establish or gain a position of advantage to eliminate the threat. Essential to effective preemptive operations is  an  accurate  estimation  of  adversary’s  capabilities  and  vulnerabilities.  All available intelligence and counterintelligence resources, including civil engineer reconnaissance,  are  used  to  determine  enemy  capabilities,  intentions,  and probable courses of action. This also includes emergency management planning and training.   1.8.4.  Negate.  Measures  taken  to  render  a  threat  or  hazard  incapable  of interfering  with  AF  operations.  This  includes  the  effective  employment  of coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive  measures and  measures to counteract hazards. For example, civil engineers designing and constructing security  improvements,  protective  shelters,  fighting  positions,  obstacles,  and revetments as well as EOD capabilities.   1.8.5. Mitigate. If actions to negate are unsuccessful employ the full range of active  and  passive  measures  such  as  civil  engineers  supporting  hardening  and sidewall protection to lessen the impact of terrorist events against DOD assets.  1.9.  Force  Protection  Condition  (FPCON)  System.  The  FPCON  system standardizes identification and recommended preventive actions and responses to  terrorist  threats  against  US  personnel  and  facilities  Table  1.2.  FPCON measures are actions taken to deter and/or prevent terrorists from conducting an attack. FPCON measures assimilate facilities, equipment, trained personnel, and procedures into a comprehensive effort designed to provide optimal protection to personnel and assets and are tailored to a specific site. FPCONs are not to be confused with threat levels. Threat levels are the result of threat assessments and are used to assist in determining local FPCONs. The objective is to ensure an integrated approach to terrorist threats. AFI 10-245 contains FPCON measures that civil engineers may have to implement during increased FPCON levels.                                       11 Table 1.2. Force Protection Conditions.  Normal–A general global threat of possible terrorist activity exists and warrants a routine security posture. At a minimum, access control will be conducted at all DOD installations and facilities. Alpha–Increased general threat of possible terrorist activity against personnel or facilities, the nature and extent of which are unpredictable, and circumstances do not justify full implementation of FPCON BRAVO measures. However, it may be necessary to implement certain measures from higher FPCON measures resulting from intelligence received or as a deterrent. Measures taken under this FPCON are capable of being maintained indefinitely. Bravo–Increased or more predictable threat of terrorist activity exists. Sustaining BRAVO measures for a prolonged period may affect operational capability and military-civil relationships with local authorities. Charlie–This condition applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely. Prolonged implementation of CHARLIE measures may create hardship and affect the activities of the unit and its personnel. Delta–Applies in the immediate area where a terrorist attack has occurred or when intelligence has been received that terrorist action against a specific location or person is imminent. Normally, this FPCON is declared as a localized condition. FPCON DELTA measures are not intended to be sustained for an extended duration.  1.10.  Terrorist  Threat  Levels.  Terrorist  threat  levels  reflect  an  intelligence assessment  of  threats  against  US  personnel  and  interests  in  foreign  countries. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) sets the DOD terrorism threat level in a particular  country,  region,  or  locale.  It  is  based  on  continuous  intelligence analysis  of  several  factors  such  as  a  terrorist  group’s  existence,  operational capability,  intentions,  activity,  and  the  operational  environment.  Combatant commanders  (CCDR)  also  set  terrorist  threat  levels  for  specific  personnel, family  members,  units,  and  installations  within  their  areas  of  responsibility (AOR) using definitions established by the DIA. Terrorist threat levels are not to be  confused  with  FPCONs  that  affect  the  local  security  posture.  Threat  level assessments  are  provided  to  senior  leaders  to  help  determine  local  FPCONs. Terrorist  threat  levels  are  also  not  to  be  confused  with  threat  conditions associated  with  the  National  Homeland  Security  Advisory  System.  Table  1.2                  12 describes the different threat levels and combination of factors used to determine each threat level.  Table 1.3. Determining Terrorist Threat Levels.  Low–No group is detected or the group's activity is non-threatening. Moderate–Terrorists are present but there are no indications of anti-US activity. The operating environment favors the host nation/US. Significant–Anti-U.S.  terrorists  are  present  and  attack  personnel  as  their preferred method of operation or a group uses large casualty-producing attacks as  their  preferred  method  but  has  limited  operational  activity.  The  operating environment is neutral. High–Anti-U.S.  terrorists  are  operationally  active  and  use  large  casualty- producing  attacks  as  their  method  of  operations.  There  is  a  substantial  DOD presence and the operating environment favors the terrorist. An incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely. Additional sources of information on terrorist threat levels include AFI 10-245.  1.11.  Training.  Training  is  essential  to  establishing  effective  FP.    The  key  to effective  FP is awareness that is sustained and reinforced from initial entry to termination  of  DOD  service.  More  specifically,  AT  training  is  integrated  into training  for  all  AF  personnel  as  required  and  when  deemed  appropriate  by commanders with AT responsibility. To enable commanders to make the most effective  decisions  possible,  personnel  at  all  organizational  levels  receive  AT training.  All  personnel  are  aware  of  basic  personal  protective  measures  and specific threats for the areas they operate in, and receive specialized training for their  duty  position.  AFI  10-245  specifies  minimum  AT  training  requirements and the current AT training for AF personnel consists of the four levels shown in Figure 1.1.                                    13 Figure 1.1.  Antiterrorism Training Concept.    Level I training is available on the DOD Antiterrorism website located at https://jkodirect.jten.mil. As part of the Annual Total Force Awareness Training, the Force  Protection (ZZ133079) course is available on the Advanced Distributed Learning System site at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/kc/rso/login/adls_login.asp. Refer to AFI 10-245 to obtain training sources for levels II through IV. Table 1.3 defines the four AT levels of training.  Table 1.4. Antiterrorism Training Levels.  Level I AT Awareness Training Level  I  training  is  provided  annually  to  all  AF  personnel  with  requisite knowledge necessary to remain vigilant for possible terrorist actions and enable employment  of  the  AT  TTP  as  outlined  in  AFI  10-245,  to  include  every  AF Service member, civilian employee, and local national or other country national in a direct-hire status by the  DOD, regardless of grade or position. Introduces terrorism and terrorism operations such as personal protective measures, terrorist surveillance  techniques,  improvised  explosive  devices  (IED),  and  kidnapping and hostage survival tactics. Level II Antiterrorism Officer/Antiterrorism Representative Training Level  II  training  is  a  resident  course  designed  to  prepare  officers  and  Non-Commissioned Officers who have at least two years AT experience to serve as Antiterrorism Officer (ATO). Unit level Antiterrorism Representatives (ATRs) unable to secure in-residence training will complete the AT Level II Refresher  14 Training  (within  180  days)  until  they  are  able  to  attend  the  AT  Level  II  in-residence  course.  For  both  ATOs  and  ATRs,  Level  II  refresher  training  is completed once every three years to maintain qualification. Level III Pre-Command AT Training Level III training provides prospective squadron, group, and wing commanders and civilian equivalent positions at the O5/O6 level with requisite knowledge to direct and supervise an AT Program. Group/Wing commanders receive the training through Group/Wing commander pre-command courses. Follow on training may be conducted at the installation-level as a refresher or supplement to briefings offered in commander courses. Level IV AT Executive Seminar Level IV seminar provides DOD senior military and civilian executive leadership with requisite knowledge to enable development of AT program policies and facilitate oversight of AT programs at the operational and strategic levels. Wing and group commanders and other command and staff officers in the grades O-6 through O-8 and civilian equivalent/senior executive service civilian employees may attend.           15 Chapter 2  CIVIL ENGINEER ROLE IN FORCE PROTECTION AND ANTITERRORISM  2.1.  Overview.  Combating  unconventional  and  asymmetrical  threats  within DOD  encompasses  antiterrorism  (AT),  terrorism  consequence  management (TCM),  and  intelligence  support  (IS).  The  intent  is  to  oppose  terrorism throughout  the  entire  threat  spectrum,  including  terrorist  use  of  chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) materials and explosive hazard (EH) devices. AT is  defensive measures taken to reduce vulnerability of individuals and property to terrorist acts; CT is offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, and  respond  to  terrorism;  TCM  is  preparation  for  and  response  to  the consequences of a terrorist incident/event; and IS is collection and dissemination of  terrorism-related  information.    AF  civil  engineers  are  relied  upon  to implement AT and CT measures, such as fence and berm construction shown in Figure 2.1, particularly in expeditionary environments where the threat level is high due to ongoing military operations.  Figure 2.1. Berm Construction in Afghanistan.   2.2.  Antiterrorism  (AT).  As  stated  earlier,  AT  is  not  to  be  used  as  a synonymous term with FP. Rather; AT is a sub-element of combating terrorism, which is a subset of the broader FP concept. The AT program  is a collective, proactive effort focused on detecting and preventing terrorist attacks, preparing to defend against attacks, and responding to consequences of terrorist incidents.                               16 In  the  expeditionary  environment,  three  key  areas  where  civil  engineers contribute  significantly  to  AT  are:  (1)  ensuring  sufficient  standoff  between identified threats and personnel and critical facilities, (2) perimeter security, and (3) mitigation of blast and fragmentation effects through facility hardening and other  means.  Civil  engineers  contribute  to  overall  AT  efforts  in  several  ways, including  ensuring  effective  standoff,  placing  barriers,  and  assisting  security forces to establish a defense in-depth capability (layered defense). These types of efforts provide additional deterrence and increase time for security forces to respond in the event of an attack. Reference JP 3-07.2 and AFI 10-245 for additional details on AT standards and procedures.  2.3.  Risk  Management.  Risk  management  is  the  process  of  identifying, assessing,  and  controlling  risks  arising  from  operational  factors  and  making decisions that balance possible adverse outcomes with mission benefits (Figure 2.2). The decision-making process is called a risk assessment. Risk assessments provide  commanders  with  a  method  to  assist  in  making  resource  allocation decisions  designed  to  protect  personnel  and  assets  from  possible  threats  in  a resource-constrained  environment.  The  risk  assessment  is  based  upon  three critical  components:  threat,  criticality,  and  vulnerability  assessments.  It  is conducted after completing all other assessments.  Any plan that does not start with  these  assessments  may  be  too  reactive  and  result  in  wasted  efforts  and resources. The key role of civil engineers in these three components is discussed later  in  this  chapter.  Once  vulnerabilities  are  identified,  commanders  manage risk  by  developing  strategies incidents,  employing countermeasures,  and  mitigating  the  effects  and  developing  plans  to  recover from terrorist incidents. Civil engineers participating in the development of AT plans also participate in risk assessments. The information collected during the risk  assessment  is  critical  to  developing  effective  FP  plans.  For  more information on risk management, refer to AFI 10-245 and AFI 31-101.  to  deter terrorist                                  17 Figure 2.2. Antiterrorism Risk Management Process.    2.3.1 Threat Assessment. The threat assessment is the process used to conduct an analysis and develop an evaluation of a potential threat consistent  with the Integrated Defense Risk Management Process (IDRMP) outlined in AFI 31-101. It  identifies  the  full  range  of  known  or  estimated  threat  capabilities,  including the  use  or  threat  of  CBRN  and  EH.  It  is  usually  conducted  by  intelligence personnel;  however  Air  Force  Office  of  Special  Investigations  (AFOSI)  is  the AF agency responsible  for preparing  specific threat assessments.  All available information  concerning  enemy  activities  is  analyzed  to  determine  if  personnel and/or critical assets might be targeted. The analysis includes factors such as a terrorist group’s capability, intentions, TTPs, history, probable course of action, and targeting as well as the security environment within which friendly forces operate.  The  DOD  Antiterrorism  Officer  (ATO)  Guide  (FOUO)  contains guidance  on  conducting  threat  assessments.  AFI  10-245  also  contains  limited threat  assessment  guidance.  Note:  Civil  engineer  squadrons,  through  the Emergency Management Working Group, develop and publish an All-Hazards Threat Assessment as part of the All-Hazards Risk Management Process.     2.3.1.1.  Identifying  the  Threat.  Along  with  security  forces,  civil  engineers generally have primary responsibility for preparing a design basis threat (DBT),                         18 the  specific threat  helps which  describes  threats  in  specific  terms.  The  DBT  is  established  for  each installation  to  identify  and  evaluate  the  types  of  aggressors  (i.e.,  terrorists, saboteurs, spies, extremist protestors, criminals, etc.) and the types of weapons, tools, and explosives likely to be used in an attack or an attempt to compromise a  military  asset.  It  is  a  critical  component  for  engineering  projects  and renovations. The threat identification also includes tactics likely to be used, such as stationary or  moving vehicle bombs, airborne or  waterborne contamination, bomb delivery via mail or supply shipments, forced or covert entry, standoff or ballistic  weapons,  visual  surveillance,  acoustic  eavesdropping,  and  insider compromise.  Identifying in  determining  asset vulnerability. This information can  then be used by civil engineers  to develop and implement protective measures to counter the specified threat.   2.3.1.2.  Planning  for  the  Threat. The  threat  level  assigned  to  the  country  or region  where  a  unit  may  be  deploying  helps  to  plan  protective  measures throughout  all  phases  of  deployments,  including  pre-deployment,  initial beddown, sustainment, and redeployment. Upon notification of deployment, unit commanders immediately contact their servicing AFOSI detachment and request a counterintelligence threat assessment. Again, civil engineers are familiar with FP  governing  directives  and  can  support  operations  by  serving  on  the installation planning team responsible for preparing the DBT. For DBT planning (UFCs)  4-010-01,  DOD  Minimum purposes,  Unified  Facility  Criteria Antiterrorism  Standards  For  Buildings;  4-020-01,  DOD  Security  Engineering Facility Planning Manual; and 4-010-02, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standoff Distances for Buildings (FOUO), contain detailed information on expeditionary site layout and protective measures designed to mitigate the effects of attacks on expeditionary and temporary structures as well as permanent structures.   2.3.2. Criticality Assessment. The criticality assessment identifies the relative criticality of assets based upon  mission criticality, impact  on national defense, replaceability  and  monetary  value.  An  asset  is  anything  of  value,  including people,  information,  equipment,  facilities  and  infrastructure.  Assets  can  also extend to more general or intangible items, such as operations, systems, strategic advantage, morale, and reputation. The primary objectives in the effective asset criticality  assessment  are  to  identify  key  assets,  determine  whether  critical functions  can  be  duplicated,  and  the  resources  required  for  duplication  and determine priority of response. The commander appoints a team to conduct the                                       19 assessment,  taking  into  consideration  all  of  the  factors  mentioned  above,  and produces  a  prioritized  list  of  critical  assets.  Civil  engineers  are  part  of  the assessment team and provide significant input into this process, especially since the assessments also examine reconstitution of infrastructure and base support. Areas encompassing multiple critical assets are referred to as critical areas. AFI 10-245 and AFI 31-101 provide additional detailed information on conducting criticality assessments.  2.3.3. Vulnerability Assessment. Terrorists conduct surveillance of US assets to  look  for  weaknesses  in  FP  measures  and  security  procedures  that  provide opportunities to attack targets at their greatest vulnerability. Vulnerabilities are gaps  in  protection  for  key  assets.  They  are  identified  by  considering  tactics associated with certain threats and levels of protection designed to defeat these tactics. Vulnerabilities may involve inadequacies in intrusion detection systems (IDSs)  and  barriers,  inadequate  standoff  distances,  and  building  construction that cannot resist explosive effects at the established  standoff distance. Where vulnerabilities  are  identified,  protective  measures  are  implemented  to  counter them. A vulnerability assessment (VA) is an evaluation of the site to determine if key assets are provided the appropriate level of protection. When a specific threat  has  been  identified  higher  levels  of  protection  are  provided;  when  a specific threat has not been identified, minimum standards are applied. During the  VA,  the  terrorist  threat,  including  likely  tactics,  is  analyzed  to  determine what assets are vulnerable to attack by what means. Civil engineers are usually the lead for conducting an annual VA. Local VA team composition depends on the  threat,  but  generally  includes  a  structural  or  infrastructure  engineer, emergency  management  specialist,  and  EOD  specialist.  AFI  10-245  contains guidance on conducting VAs. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency  website, located  at  http://www.dtra.mil/,  also  contains  helpful information  for conducting VAs.  2.4. Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAMs). RAMs are random, multiple security measures that consistently change the look of a site's FP posture. RAMs introduce  unpredictability  into  the  site's  overall  FP  program  and  alter  the external  appearance  of  FP  patterns.  Randomly  selecting  and  implementing FPCON measures without a set pattern, either in terms of the measures selected, time,  place,  or  other  variables,  frustrates  surveillance  attempts  by  terrorists.  It becomes harder for them to predict certain actions or discern patterns or routines                                       20 that  may  reveal  vulnerabilities.  RAM  also  provides  training  and  increases  FP awareness  for  site  personnel  by  varying  routine  operations.  It  helps  identify which  measures  the  installation’s  infrastructure  is  more  capable  of  sustaining and  those  that  unduly  stress  resources.  Other  FP  measures  not  normally associated  with  FPCONs  (e.g.,  locally  developed,  site-specific)  can  also  be employed randomly to supplement the basic FPCON measures already in place. Civil  engineer  operations  can  increase  RAM  visibility  and  effectiveness  in confusing enemy surveillance attempts and planning. A list of baseline FPCON measures can be found in AFI 10-245. These measures are exercised regularly and associated plans are adjusted to correct any inadequacies.                 21 Chapter 3  FORCE PROTECTION PLANNING  3.1. Overview. FP planning is conducted throughout all phases of contingencies. Key aspects of FP planning involving civil engineers include site selection and site  layout.  Expeditionary  sites  and  bases  are  positioned  where  they  offer commanders  the  best  means  for  projecting  and  sustaining  air  power.  But  also positioned  where  the  terrain  is  favorable  to  engineering,  construction,  and environmental  considerations.  When  possible,  engineers  conduct  a  pre-site survey  to  learn  as  much  as  possible  about  the  deployed  location  or  region (Figure  3.1).  The  survey  can  be  used  to  develop  relationships,  perform inventories, and take measurements. A pre-site survey assists in determining the equipment, tools, and materials required to implement protective measures at the deployed location. Once deployed, some items may be difficult if not impossible to obtain. To effectively address the requirements of both site selection and site layout, civil engineers are familiar with UFCs that address FP and AT standards. This  chapter  covers  civil  engineer  FP  planning,  site  selection,  site  layout,  and the  criteria  established  to  ensure  minimum  AT  standards  are  met  while conducting  these  activities.  Guidance  on  attaining  higher  levels  of  protection when deemed necessary by commanders is also covered.  Figure 3.1. Force Protection Pre-Site Survey in Iraq.  3.2.  Force  Protection  Plan.  The  FP  plan  consists  of  specific  anti-threat  and antiterrorism  measures  developed  to  protect  personnel,  facilities,  and  critical                                22 in  planning  force  protection assets  to  include,  but  not  limited  to,  threat  assessments,  threat  levels, vulnerability assessments, criticality assessments, risk assessments, and FPCON measures.  Important  factors in  deployed environments include the availability of existing facilities, the types of structures in which people live and work, existing natural and manmade features, types and quantities of indigenous construction materials, available real estate, and layout of utilities and other base infrastructure.   3.2.1. The commander typically establishes an Antiterrorism Working Group to develop the base FP plan. Civil engineers on the working group usually focus on the physical security and integrated defense (ID) aspects of the plan. The plan includes elements that contribute to ID and the protection of key assets such as site  layout,  barrier  placement,  berm  construction,  security  lighting,  backup power, water source protection, expedient hardening, and terrain modification.  3.2.2.  Absolute  protection  against  enemy  or  terrorist  activities  is  not  possible. Therefore, protective plans and procedures are based on the threat identified by intelligence  personnel.  Considering  the  threat,  protective  measures  strike  a reasonable balance between protection required, mission requirements, available manpower, and available resources.  3.2.3.  The  FP  Plan  itself  is  not  an  end  state.  The  plan  is  a  living  document constantly  reviewed  and  revised  as  threats,  resource  requirements,  and innovations  cause  changes  in  FP  tactics.  Civil  engineers  are  prepared  to  offer observations  and  innovations  that  counter  and  mitigate  terrorist  threats  and increase force protection.  3.3. Resource Constraints. Resources needed to implement FP plans include, but  not  limited  to,  time,  manpower,  materials,  equipment,  and  funding. Resources may be committed to FP at any time during threat, vulnerability, or criticality assessments. When applicable, resource commitment may be delayed until all assessments are complete, including risk assessment.   3.3.1. Commanders typically use risk management to allocate resources towards assets  most  vulnerable  to  the  identified  threat  and  would  have  the  most damaging  effect  on  mission.  Although  FP  is  inherently  a  top  priority  for  all commanders,  limited  resources  under  certain  circumstances  and  during  some                                       23 stages  of  deployment  may  cause  risks  to  become  unacceptable  from  a  civil engineer perspective.  3.3.2.  Civil  engineers  are  persistent  in  efforts  to  obtain  required  resources  to implement  FP  measures  required  to  counter  identified  threats.  Most  efforts  to obtain FP resources are performed before deploying and reassessed immediately upon arrival at the deployment location.  3.4. Site Selection. Civil engineers participate in the pre-site survey and learn as much  as  possible  about  the  region.  Selecting  a  site  suitable  to  beddown  the expected population, weapon systems, support equipment, and other assets are considered along with the need for standoff.  3.4.1. Expeditionary and temporary structures are typically composed of metal, fabric, or wood frames and rigid walls which generally make them impractical to  harden  or  retrofit.  This  makes  establishing  proper  standoff  distance  the primary  approach  to  FP  in  the  expeditionary  environment.  Unfortunately,  this also drives the need for selecting large beddown sites.  3.4.2.  Sufficient  space  for  dispersal  of  certain  functions  and  equipment  is planned  so  that  commanders  have  flexibility  to  increase  beddown  population and standoff distances, if required in response to threats.  3.4.3. Upon arrival to the deployed site, develop a list of equipment, tools, and materials needed to immediately implement protective measures.  3.5. Site Layout. Site layout is an extremely important process in FP planning. If site layout is not well thought out, it may be very manpower exhaustive and costly  to  rearrange  assets  once  they  are  in  place.  Site  layout  is  based  largely upon the known threat to personnel, mission-critical assets, support facilities and equipment from each likely enemy tactic (i.e., standoff weapons, vehicle bombs, etc.). Key civil engineer planning aspects include standoff distances, orientation of  facilities,  layout  of  roads,  layering  of  defense  tactics,  sidewall  protection, facility resources, compartmentalization of assets, and locations of physical barriers, entry control points  (ECP),  observation  posts,  defensive  fighting  positions  and  personnel bunkers. Chapter 4 covers these areas in more detail. Attachment 2 also contains techniques, hardening dispersal of critical                                       24 FP elements to consider during site selection and site layout and can be used as a quick  reference  checklist;  this  list  is  not  all-inclusive.  While  conducting  site selection  and  site  layout  functions,  use  available  geographical  information system  (GIS)  tools  to  enhance  survivability  efforts  and  ensure  minimum  AT standards  are  met.  Every  deployment  is  unique  and  therefore  presents  unique challenges.  The  following  paragraphs  highlight  some  important  site  layout planning factors.  3.5.1.  Maximize  Standoff  Distance.  Putting  maximum  distance  between personnel,  critical  assets  and  potential  threats  is  generally  the  easiest,  most economical  and  most  effective  FP  strategy.  Maximizing  distance  provides flexibility  to  attain  higher  levels  of  protection  to  counter  threats.  Maximum standoff  distances  are  defined  in  UFC  4-010-01.  Standoff  distances  differ  for bases  and  camps  with  controlled  perimeters  and  those  without  controlled perimeters.  If  a  controlled  perimeter  does  not  exist,  standoff  distances  usually are  greater.  When  recommended  standoff  distances  cannot  be  achieved, structures  are  analyzed  by  an  engineer  experienced  in  blast  resistant  design. Install recommended hardening to mitigate potential blast effects.  3.5.2.  Provide  Effective  Building  Layout.  Effective  building  layout  and orientation can significantly limit terrorist surveillance capabilities and targeting opportunities.  This  is  particularly  important  when  areas  directly  outside  an installation are not under the installation's control. Ensure that the main entrance to a facility/structure does not face the perimeter or other uncontrolled vantage points with direct lines of sight. Structures can also be oriented in a manner that may  reduce  effects  from  explosive  hazards.  Chapter  4  covers  this  subject  in more detail.  3.5.3.  Provide  Effective  Road  Layout.  Although  roads  are  often  designed  to minimize travel time from one place to another, caution is taken when planning roads. Roads that provide straight line access to key facilities and other critical assets allow a vehicle to gain the speed necessary to breach protective barriers or crash  through  facilities.  Roads  are  generally  designed  to  limit  the  maximum speed a vehicle can attain before the driver loses control or draws attention from security  personnel.  Designing  sharp  curves  or  using  barriers  to  create  a serpentine layout that force drivers to negotiate a series of sharp turns can limit vehicle approach speed. Vehicle operators attempting to leave the road in order                                       25 (PDC)  website (USACE)  Protective  Design  Center to gain  speed towards a potential target increase the chance of early detection and response. Roads approaching key facilities are made parallel to the facilities versus a perpendicular approach. Barriers, trees, and other obstacles can reduce a driver’s ability to leave roads or to have a direct path to the facility from the road.  3.6. Unified Facilities Criteria. This section focuses on UFCs which prescribe FP standards for new, existing, temporary, and expeditionary structures. These publications  can  be  located  at  the  Whole  Building  Design  Guide  website  at http://dod.wbdg.org and may also be downloaded from the US Army Corps of Engineers at https://pdc.usace.army.mil.  3.6.1. Standards. Minimum DOD AT standards for new and existing inhabited facilities and expeditionary and temporary structures are outlined in UFC 4-010-01. These standards are intended to minimize the possibility of mass casualties in facilities where no known terrorist activity currently exists. Graphic Training Aid  (GTA)  90-01-011,  Joint  Forward  Operations  Base  (JFOB)  Protection Handbook,  provides  standards  for  expeditionary  structures  where  a  terrorist threat exists. Since it would be cost-prohibitive to design facilities that address every conceivable threat, the  standards are designed to provide an appropriate level of protection for all personnel at a reasonable cost. Each DOD component may set more stringent AT building standards to meet the specific threats in its AOR.  Air  Forces  Central,  Air  Forces  Southern,  United  States  Air  Forces  in Europe,  and  Pacific  Air  Forces  have  supplemental  instructions  regarding  FP construction  standards.  Contact  the  theater-level  A4C  planner  for  more information.  Refer  to  UFC  4-020-01  when  developing  cost  estimates  for expeditionary  construction  and  where  more  stringent  local  standards  apply  for detailed descriptions of the levels of protection.  3.6.2. Levels of Protection. Levels of protection relate to the degree to which assets (i.e., personnel, facilities, equipment, etc.) are protected based on known and  specified  threats  such  as  vehicle-borne  improvised  explosive  devices (VBIEDs),  rockets,  artillery  and  mortars.  The  primary  strategy  to  achieve  an appropriate  level  of  protection  is  to  maximize  available  standoff  to  keep potential  or  known  threats  as  far  away  from  personnel,  inhabited  facilities, equipment and other critical assets as possible. However, if space is inadequate                                       26 to  achieve  appropriate  standoff  distances,  hardening  and  blast  mitigation techniques are applied to achieve an acceptable level of protection based on the asset's  criticality  and  the  threat.  Primary  gathering  facilities  (i.e.,  dining facilities,  billeting,  recreation  facilities,  etc.)  are  hardened,  if  practicable,  or provided  some  type  of  blast  and  fragmentation  protection,  including  overhead cover and compartmentalization Unless adequate planning is done to obtain the needed  space  to  achieve  appropriate  standoff  for  expeditionary  assets  in  high-threat  environments,  personnel  can  be  highly  vulnerable  to  an  attack.  This potential  vulnerability  drives  the  need  for  larger  sites.  In  addition,  hardened structures, such as bunkers and foxholes with overhead cover, can be provided in the immediate proximity of all areas where personnel live and work (Figure 3.2).  Figure 3.2. Protective Shelters at a FOB in Afghanistan.     Selecting levels of protection for all key and critical assets involves a tradeoff for acceptable levels of risk. UFC 4-010-01 defines the different standards for new  and  existing  buildings  and  expeditionary  or  temporary  structures,  and contains qualitative descriptions of potential damage to buildings and structures at different levels of protection. Detailed quantitative descriptions of the levels of protection can be found in UFC 4-020-02FA, Security Engineering: Concept Design (FOUO).  3.6.3.  Standoff  Distances.  The  primary  objective  of  design  and  site  layout strategy is to keep potential threats as far away from personnel and critical assets                             27 as possible. Due to the type of construction, standoff distances differ for new or existing buildings and expeditionary or temporary structures.  3.6.3.1. New and Existing Buildings. Standoff distances for new and existing buildings are defined in Table B-1 and illustrated in Figures B-1 through B-4 of UFC  4-010-01.  The  standards  were  developed  for  a  wide  range  of conventionally  constructed  buildings.  Distances  listed  under  the  “Minimum Standoff Distance” column of Table B-1 are provided except where not possible. The  UFC  further  states  that  lesser  standoff  distances  may  be  allowed  where required level of protection can be shown through analysis or can be achieved through  building  hardening  or  other  mitigating  construction  or  retrofit.  The applicable explosive weights indicated in the table may be obtained from UFC 4-010-02.  3.6.3.2.  Expeditionary  and  Temporary  Structures.  Standoff  distances  for expeditionary and temporary structures are defined in Table D-1 of UFC 4-010-01 and illustrated in Figure 3.3 below. These standoff distances were developed for Small and Medium Shelters and Southeast Asia (SEA) Huts. The applicable explosive weights indicated in the UFC table are obtained from UFC 4-010-02. An  asterisk  “*”  in  Figure  3.3  indicates  the  standoff  distance  varies  by construction  and  category  of  construction.  An  analysis  of  the  structure  by  an engineer  experienced  in  blast-resistant  design  is  required.  Hardening  can  be applied  as  necessary  to  mitigate  effects  of  explosives  indicated.  If  the  CCDR determines  a  higher  level  of  protection  than  is  specified  in  UFC  4-010-01  is required, based on a known threat and an analysis of vulnerability and criticality assessments, refer to UFC 4-020-01 for methods of achieving higher levels of protection.                                28 Figure 3.3. Standoff Distances and Separation for Expeditionary and Temporary Structures.               29 Chapter 4  PHYSICAL SECURITY  4.1.  Overview.  A  key  element  of  FP  is  physical  security.  Physical  security programs are designed for prevention and provide the means to counter threats when preventive measures are ignored or bypassed. DOD 5200.08-R, Physical Security  Program,  defines  physical  security  as  active  and  passive  measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to personnel, equipment, installations, information,  and  to  safeguard  them  against  espionage,  sabotage,  terrorism, damage and criminal activity. This chapter provides guidance and considerations for implementing physical protective measures designed to eliminate threats or mitigate the effects of an attack against personnel and critical resources. In the absence of a specific threat, the minimum DOD AT standards in UFC 4-010-01 are applied.  4.2. Aspects of Physical Security. Physical security is built on the foundation that  baseline  security  and  preparedness  postures  are  established  based  on  the local  threat,  site-specific  vulnerabilities,  identification  of  critical  assets,  and employment  of  available  resources.  Physical  security  focuses  on  physical measures  and  procedures  designed  to  safeguard  assets  from  likely  aggressors. As  discussed  earlier,  plans  for  implementing  these  physical  security  measures begin far in advance of the deployment (including site selection and site layout planning)  and  continue  throughout  all  phases  of  the  deployment,  including initial  beddown,  sustainment,  and  redeployment.  Key  physical  security  tasks include  the  implementation  of  protective  measures  designed  to  stop  potential aggressors and mitigate the impact of an attack on personnel and other critical resources.  This  requires,  among  many  other  things,  that  security  personnel  be capable of detecting and identifying an aggressor as far in advance of an attack as possible. Civil engineers team with security forces to design and implement physical  security  measures  that  provide  this  early  detection  capability.  Two broad areas of physical security include perimeter security and internal security. This chapter focuses primarily on these two aspects of physical security.  4.3. Perimeter Security. One of the most important FP tasks during the initial stages of deployment and beddown is establishing perimeter security. Working with security forces, civil engineers help establish a continuous physical barrier                                       30 which  clearly  defines  the  physical  limits  of  the  site,  to  prevent  unauthorized access.  Figure  4.1  illustrates  key  aspects  of  perimeter  security.  This  involves constructing  fences,  placing  concertina  wire,  installing  perimeter  lighting, constructing  berms  and  ditches,  placing  barriers,  and  assisting  with  the installation  of  security  cameras.  Also  key  is  ensuring  backup  power  source  is available  in  the  event  systems  requiring  power  are  disrupted  by  intentional  or unintentional  damage.  In  addition,  clear  zones  beyond  the  perimeter  are  kept free  of  weeds,  rubbish,  or  other  material  capable  of  offering  concealment  or assistance to an intruder attempting to penetrate perimeter security. Also, secure utility ducts, drainage culverts, concrete trenches, and storm drains originating from outside the perimeter by using screens and grates. Locks can be installed on  manhole  covers.  Intrusion  detection  sensors  may  be  used  along  with surveillance  equipment  to  provide  greater  security.  The  next  few  paragraphs discuss  how  physical  security  may  be  employed the  expeditionary environment.  Figure 4.1. Perimeter Security Measures.  in  4.3.1.  Barriers.  One  of  the  most  important  aspects  of  establishing  effective physical security is the ability to employ barriers. Barriers are used to maintain standoff  distances,  establish  boundaries,  limit  and  control  pedestrian  and vehicular flow and access, channel movement in certain directions and to certain points,  obstruct  line-of-sight  views  from  outside  the  perimeter,  protect  key                            31 facilities and mission-critical assets, and compartmentalize areas within primary gathering  buildings.  Civil  engineers  are  largely  responsible  for  employing barriers as part of the physical security element of FP. Refer to UFC 4-022-02, Selection  and  Application  of  Vehicle  Barriers,  for  design,  selection  and application of active and passive vehicles barriers.   4.3.1.1. Barrier Plan. Developing and implementing a barrier plan is a critical FP  function  for  civil  engineers. The  barrier  plan  outlines  exactly  how  barriers will  be  employed  continuously  or  during  periods  of  heightened  alert.  A prioritized list of key facilities and critical assets to be protected forms the basis for  the  plan.  This  list  is  usually  developed  during  the  various  assessments: threat,  vulnerability,  criticality,  and  risk  assessments.  The  barrier  plan summarizes  the  number  and  types  of  barriers  employed  as  well  as  additional requirements, employment locations, if and where barriers will be prepositioned, their  intended  purpose  (i.e.,  traffic  control,  perimeter  security,  etc.),  and resources  and  equipment  needed  to  move  or  relocate  and  install  the  barriers when  needed  (i.e.,  anchors,  cables,  forklift,  trailer,  etc.).  Civil  engineers  work closely  with  security  forces  to  identify  resources  needed  to  adequately  protect key  facilities  and  assets.  Some  installations  may  preposition  key  assets  and employ them upon heightened alert or during periods of increased threat. In the expeditionary  environment,  limited  resources  may  not  allow  for  maintaining barriers  in  storage  or  prepositioned  status  for  heightened  alert.  Barriers  may need  to  be  continuously  employed  to  provide  protection  in  high-threat environments. This determination is  made on site.  A dedicated barrier team is appointed, trained, and exercised regularly.  4.3.1.2. Types of Barriers. There are many barrier designs that can be used for a  variety  of  purposes  (e.g.,  pedestrians,  vehicles,  weapons,  etc.)  and  various types of structures and natural features that may be used as barriers (e.g., trees, mountains, water, wood, concrete, etc.). Barriers are categorized as either active (containing moving parts) or passive (non-moving parts). It is important not to confuse the different types of barriers available with the purpose for which the barrier is being used or can be used. For example, some barriers may be used to mitigate the effects of blast and/or fragmentation in the event of an attack and may  sometimes  be  referred  to  as  blast  or  fragmentation  barriers.  These  are passive-type  barriers.  A  variety  of  passive  barriers  may  be  found  in  the expeditionary environment (e.g., Bitburg barrier, Jersey barrier, Alaska barrier,                                       32 T-barrier,  bastions,  etc.).  Some  active  barriers  commonly  found  in  the expeditionary environment include portable tire shredders and arm barrier gates. Barriers  can  be  further  characterized  as  moveable  (may  require  heavy equipment),  fixed  (permanently  installed),  or  portable.  Portable  barriers  are normally used temporarily until either a moveable or fixed barrier system can be employed. The following paragraphs further explain the types of barriers and the purposes for which they are commonly used.  4.3.1.2.1. Active Barriers. Active barriers are either electronically controlled or manually  operated  to  allow  or  restrict  access.  Examples  include  barricades, retractable  bollards,  beams,  gates,  and  tire  shredders.  Active  barriers  are normally  employed  at  entry  and  exit  points  to  the  site  or  at  the  entrance  to  a critical  facility  with  a  controlled  perimeter.  From  a  safety  standpoint,  active vehicle barriers are capable of causing serious injury or death, even when used for  their  intended  purpose.  This  can  be  caused  by  equipment  malfunction, inadvertent activation, or operator error. If using these types of barriers, make sure  there  are  signs  in  place  to  alert  vehicles  to  their  presence  (i.e.,  warning signs,  lights,  bright  colors,  etc.).  In  addition,  these  types  of  barriers  include backup  power,  emergency  cutoff  switches,  and  adequate  lighting.  Figure  4.2 through Figure  4.7  shows  examples  of  active  barriers  that  can  be  used  in  the expeditionary environment.  Figure 4.2. Portable Barrier.                                Figure 4.3. Wedge (Drum) Barrier.  33  Figure 4.4. Retractable Bollards.   Figure 4.5. Lift Plate Barricade System.                    Figure 4.6. Sliding Gate.  34  Figure 4.7. Tire Shredder.     4.3.1.2.2.  Passive  Barriers.  Passive  barriers  have  no  moving  parts  and  are designed  to  absorb  energy  upon  impact  and  transfer  that  energy  into  the foundation.  Examples  include  portable  or  permanent  concrete  structures, concrete  bollards,  posts,  guardrails,  ditches,  and  reinforced  fences.  Passive barriers along the perimeter or interior fence line are designed to allow little or no  penetration,  especially  if  the  available  standoff  distance  is  limited.  Passive barriers  are  commonly  found  in  the  expeditionary  environment,  particularly  if the contingency operation is  of a limited duration. Figure 4.8 through Figure 4.13 shows examples of passive barriers that may be used in the expeditionary environment.  For  additional  details  on  different  types  of  barriers,  refer  to  Air Force  Handbook  (AFH)  10-222,  Volume  14,  Guide  to  Fighting  Positions, Shelters, Obstacles, and Revetments; and the JFOB Protection Handbook. The JFOB  handbook  may  be  accessed  on  the  United  States  Army  Central  Army Registry  (CAR)  website.  To  obtain  a  copy  of  the  handbook  from  the  CAR website requires a Common Access Card at the following link.                         35 https://rdl.train.army.mil/catalog/go/100.ATSC/0BEF6011-E36F-4F1E-8965-5DB0931D9010-1300684489163.

Sand Bags.   Figure 4.13. Barriers.     4.3.2.  Perimeter  Fences.  Fences  are  used  to  define  the  boundary  of  a  site  or structure, direct and control the flow of traffic, and establish clear zones. They                  37 are  also  used  in  conjunction  with  security  lighting,  IDSs,  closed  circuit television,  and  other  means  of  integrating  security.  Chain  link  fences  are antipersonnel  barriers.  They  are  cost-effective,  usually  readily  available,  and provide a moderate degree of protection. Chain link fences are more effective if reinforced with cable or topped with outriggers and concertina wire, razor wire, or multiple strands of barbed wire, as shown in Figure 4.14. Since most fences can be easily penetrated by a  moving  vehicle, they are not considered vehicle barriers and can resist impact only if reinforced by barriers capable of absorbing the  impact  of  moving  vehicles.  For  additional  details  on  security  fencing, reference  Military  Handbook  (MIL-HDBK)-1013/10,  Design  Guidelines  for Security  Fencing,  Gates,  Barriers,  and  Guard  Facilities;  and  UFC  4-022-03, Security Fences and Gates.  Figure 4.14. Perimeter Fences and Barriers.    4.3.3. Utility Openings. Large utility openings, such as drainage pipes, culverts, vents, and ducts can provide an intruder with a means of entry or exit across a site’s perimeter without triggering an alarm. These types of openings can also be used to conceal weapons or plant explosives. For these reasons, the number of culverts and other drainage pipes crossing a site’s perimeter are minimized. The DOD defines man-passable openings as having a minimum of 96 square inches with the least dimension equal to or greater than 6 inches can be protected by securely fastened, welded bar grilles shown in Figure 4.15. AF criteria specify that the minimum opening is 6.4” inches. As an alternative, these structures can be  composed  of  multiple  pipes  with  diameters  of  10  inches  or  less.  Multiple pipes  of  this  diameter  may  also  be  placed  and  secured  in  the  inflow  end  of  a drainage culvert to prevent intrusion into the area. If grilles or pipes are installed                               38 in  culverts  or  other  drainage  structures,  ensure  corrective  action  is  taken  to compensate  for  the  diminished  flow  capacity  and  increased  maintenance required. In addition, secure all manhole covers that could be accessed and used to cross the site’s perimeter. For detailed information on securing these types of structures,  refer  to  UFC  4-020-03FA,  Security  Engineering:  Final  Design (FOUO) and AFI 31-101. This document is FOUO and can be downloaded from the USACE’s PDC website at https://pdc.usace.army.mil.  Figure 4.15. Grille Installed on Drainage Culvert.    4.3.4.  Entry  Control  Facility  (ECF).  The  ECF  is  a  physical  boundary controlling vehicle access at the perimeter of the site. Some guidance may also refer  to  these  boundaries  as  access  control  points.  The  ECF  is  a  security checkpoint at or outside the secured perimeter of an installation that allows for sufficient standoff from the perimeter to protected facilities and critical assets. Security  personnel  use  the  ECF  to  control  vehicle  access  to  the  site  using various  methods  such  as  guard  shacks,  vehicle  barriers,  and  inspection  points shown in Figure 4.16. Civil engineers team with security forces in determining the location and layout for ECFs and other structures needed to control vehicle access  to  the  site.  These  determinations  are  based  on  a  threat  intelligence assessment.                            39 Figure 4.16. Typical Entry Control Facility.  Site   4.3.4.1.  Location.  ECFs  are  located  to  provide  maximum  standoff  distance between  the  ECF  and  critical  facilities  and  equipment.  Minimum  standoff distances are outlined in UFCs 4-010-01 and 4-010-02. The CCDR may increase these distances based on the known threat for a particular area. Always refer to the specific operational order to determine if prescribed standoff distances are more stringent than those outlined in UFCs.  4.3.4.2.  Layout.  The  main  ECF  is  subdivided  into  zones  and  allow  enough queue space to prevent obstructing traffic on main roads by vehicles waiting to enter the site as shown in Figure 4.17. ECF zones consist of an approach zone, access zone, response zone, and safety zone. The approach zone is located at the interface  between  public  roads  and  the  site.  Access  zones  comprise  the  main portion of the ECF. This is where guard facilities and vehicle inspection areas are located. Response zones extend beyond access zones to the final barrier or entry point. This is usually where security forces sets up an overwatch tower as a  final  denial  point  for  vehicles  attempting  to  gain  unauthorized  entry. Overwatch  towers  are  hardened  firing  positions  that  provide  coverage  for vehicle  entry,  exit,  and  search  areas.  The  safety  zones  include  all  techniques (fences, barriers, etc.) used to maintain an acceptable standoff distance between the ECF and critical assets. Vehicles approaching the site are channeled through a maze of barriers that force drivers to decrease their rate of speed. Vehicles are                           40 channeled into search pits to allow security personnel to search for and detect explosives.  Search  pits  are  separated  from  local  traffic  by  security  fences  and vehicle barriers and located outside the minimum prescribed standoff distance. Civil  engineers  work  closely  with  security  and  intelligence  personnel  in designing and siting vehicle search pits. Separate points of access to the site are established  for  commercial  trucks  and  delivery  vehicles,  outside  the  standoff distance, where they can be searched prior to gaining access. Detailed guidance for  constructing  ECFs  can  be  found  in  UFC  4-022-01,  Security  Engineering: Entry Control Facilities/Access Control Points.              41   Figure 4.17. Entry Control Facility Zones.       4.3.4.3.  ECF  Barriers.  ECF  barriers  are  designed  to  maintain  control.  They address  the  counter-mobility  aspect  of  FP  (preventing  unauthorized  vehicles   42 from entering the site) and are set up to channel vehicles and pedestrians into or away  from  certain  areas.  The  ECF  is  the  point  at  which  vehicles  are  either cleared  or  rejected  from  accessing  the  site  and  are  strictly  controlled.  ECF barriers  define  boundaries  and  provide  security  personnel  with  a  visual assessment  of  a  driver’s  intent  as  a  vehicle  passes  through  certain  zones  and reacts  to  barriers  employed  to  control  path,  speed,  and  direction.  CE  places barriers along main roads leading to the site from public roads, to establish an approach zone and throughout the rest of the ECF to maintain control during the clearing  process.  Barriers  are  anchored  to  the  surface  and/or  cabled  together (Figure 4.18) to provide increased resistance to penetration attempts. To slow speeds  of  approaching  vehicles,  place  barriers  in  a  manner  that  produces  a serpentine  path  that  drivers  negotiate  to  reach  the  entry  point.  Desired  speeds can be controlled by placing barriers at certain distances apart. For example, to allow a maximum speed of 15 mph, place barriers 30 feet apart in an alternating pattern as depicted in Figure 4.19. Creating 90-degree turns also forces drivers to  reduce  speeds.  A  vehicle  leaving  these  paths  draws  attention  and  alerts security personnel of a possible attempt to evade clearance procedures and gain unauthorized access to the site.  Figure 4.18. Jersey Barriers Cabled Together.                             43 Figure 4.19. Barriers Used to Form Serpentine Path.    4.3.5. Berms and Ditches. Berms and ditches can be constructed around the site perimeter to slow or prevent vehicles from penetrating the restricted boundary as illustrated in Figure 4.20. Triangular ditches and hillside cuts are relatively easy to  construct  and  are  very  effective  against  a  wide  range  of  vehicles.  Side  hill cuts are variations of the triangular ditch adapted to side hill locations and have the  same  advantages  and  limitations.  A  trapezoidal  ditch  requires  more construction time but is more effective in stopping a vehicle. With this type of construction, a vehicle can be trapped when the front end falls into the ditch and the  undercarriage  is  hung  up  on  the  leading  edge  of  the  ditch.  For  additional information on constructing berms and ditches, reference AFH 10-222, Volume 14.                    Figure 4.20. Berms and Ditches. 44   4.3.6.  Lighting  and  Sensors.  Security  lighting  allows  personnel  to  observe areas  around  the  perimeter,  at  ECPs,  and  throughout  the  site  during  hours  of darkness without exposing themselves. It is best to use lighting that produces a glare  upon  individuals  approaching  a  perimeter  but  does  not  illuminate  and expose  security  personnel,  guard  houses,  or  observation  posts.  Avoid  glare lighting  if  it  causes  traffic  hazards.  Different  types  of  terrain  and  surfaces required  to  be  illuminated  can  be  analyzed  to  determine  the  brightness  of security lighting needed to ensure personnel can observe all areas in and around the site and as far outside the perimeter as possible. The site commander may require some areas to be void of lighting during certain times or at all times to prevent  illuminating  a  potential  target.  To  be  more  effective,  security  lighting may be combined with an intrusion detection system as shown in Figure 4.21. Numerous  types  of  IDSs  are  currently  being  used  in  the  expeditionary environment  (microwave,  passive  infrared,  active  infrared,  seismic,  magnetic, motion  detectors,  closed  circuit  television,  etc.).  Certain  factors  determine  the type  of  system  to  install,  including  site  location,  terrain,  weather,  manpower available  for  monitoring,  etc.  Regardless  of  the  type  of  lighting  or  IDS  used, provide  emergency  backup  power.  For  more  information  on  security  lighting and  IDSs,  refer  to  the  Illuminating  Engineering  Society  of  North  America (IESNA)  HB-9,  Lighting  Handbook:  IESNA  G-1-03,  Guide  for  Security                         45 Lighting  for  People,  Property,  and  Public  Spaces:  and  UFC  4-021-02, Electronic Security Systems and AFI 31-101.  Figure 4.21. Security Lighting and Intrusion Detection System.    4.3.7.  Obscuration  Screens.  Perimeter  obscuration  screens  are  used  to  block direct lines of sight to sensitive areas or facilities from outside the perimeter in an effort to reduce targeting opportunities from direct fire weapons. This can be done in various ways using trees, dense vegetation, chain link fences with slats, wooden fences, camouflage netting, earth berms, etc. Obscuration screens do not provide protection against direct fire weapons. Another type of screen, referred to as a pre-detonation screen, may be used for protection against these types of weapons. Pre-detonation screens are covered later in this chapter. Install facility obscuration  screens on the  side of  facilities  facing the perimeter of the site to reduce  exposure.  Obscuration  screens  as  shown  in  Figure  4.22  can  also  be placed  on  perimeter  fences  to  block  lines  of  sight  into  the  site.  When  using obscuration screens, make sure personnel inside the site or facility are still able to see outside and observe any suspicious activities.                         46 Figure 4.22. Obscuration Screen on Perimeter Fence.    4.3.8. Observation Posts, Guard Towers, and Defensive Fighting Positions. Civil  engineers  work  closely  with  security  forces  personnel  in  siting  and constructing  hardened  structures  to  be  used  for  observation,  overwatch,  and defensive fighting as shown in Figure 4.23. Some of the construction planning factors to be considered include: location, terrain, height, maximum number of personnel  each  structure  is  required  to  support,  level  of  hardening,  number  of gun  ports,  heating,  ventilation,  and  air  conditioning  requirements,  plumbing requirements,  lighting,  electronic  surveillance  and  communications  equipment requirements,  etc.  These  structures  are  placed  at  least  30  feet  inside  the perimeter of the site and provide a clear view of the inner and outer clear zones and perimeter fence line. For details on constructing guard towers, observation posts, defensive fighting positions, and bunkers, reference the JFOB Protection Handbook referred to earlier and AFH 10-222, Volume 14. Detailed drawings and construction information for these types of structures can also be obtained by  contacting  the  USACE  Engineer  Research  and  Development  Center  at urocusace@us.army.mil and requesting the Theater Construction Management System (TCMS) software.                                      47 Figure 4.23. Observation Posts, Guard Towers, and Defensive Fighting Positions.    4.3.9.  Barriers.  Earth-filled  container  barriers  (also  called  bastions)  are commonly used in the expeditionary environment to construct various types of structures and sidewall protection. These containers come in various sizes and all have national stock numbers assigned; see Table 4.1 and Figure 4.24.  Table 4.1. Barrier Container Sizes and National Stock Numbers.

Internal Security. The focus on internal security, from a CE perspective, such generally dispersal, involves compartmentalization, revetment  construction,  bunker  construction,  and protection of utilities to name a few (Figure 4.25). Existing facilities used in the expeditionary  environment  may  need  to  be  hardened  to  provide  an  acceptable level  of  protection  from  rockets,  artillery,  and  mortars.  In  addition, expeditionary structures, bunkers, observation posts, and fighting positions are constructed to support ID objectives as covered in Chapter 5. The following are basic  concepts  and  techniques  that  may  be  used  to  provide  protection  for existing and expeditionary structures. Refer to the JFOB Protection Handbook for additional FP construction details and options.                    Figure 4.25. Internal Security Measures.  49   4.4.1. Mass Notification Systems (MNS). MNS provide immediate notification to  personnel  during  emergencies.  The  system  relays  information  regarding FPCONs,  imminent  threats,  attacks  in  progress,  etc.,  and  directs  personnel  to take certain response actions  (e.g., take cover, evacuate, etc.). Civil engineers, especially  Fire  Emergency  Services  and  EM,  work  closely  with  security  and communications  personnel  to  install  and  maintain  a  MNS  with  primary  and backup  power.  Details  on  MNS  can  be  found  in  UFC  4-021-01,  Design  and O&M:  Mass  Notification  Systems.  Although  there  are  many  different  systems available, in  expeditionary environments,  shown  in  Figure  4.26.This  system  is  generally  not  suitable  for notifying personnel working or residing in permanent structures since the voice messages  may  be  unintelligible.  In  these  instances,  civil  engineers  work  with security and communications personnel to develop alternative ways of providing mass notification.  Figure 4.26. Mass Notification System.  the  Giant  Voice  system is typically  used                           50 4.4.2.  Facilities.  Achieving  appropriate  levels  of  protection  for  facilities  most commonly  used  in  the  expeditionary  environment,  such  as  Small  Shelter Systems as shown in Figure 4.27 can be very difficult. This is why standoff is particularly  important  in  expeditionary  environments.  Personnel  may  be abnormally vulnerable to certain threats during the initial stages of a deployment when  the  site  is  still  somewhat  austere,  resources  are  limited,  and  access  to permanently  constructed  facilities  has  not  yet  been  negotiated.  If  US  forces occupy existing permanent facilities offered by the host nation, civil engineers may need to apply the standards outlined in UFC 4-010-01 for new and existing buildings.  Where  more  stringent  local  standards  apply,  or  where  local commanders dictate additional measures as a result of specific terrorist threats, these standards may be supplemented to achieve higher levels of protection. If increased levels of protection are warranted, detailed descriptions may be found in UFC 4-020-01. Also refer to AFH 10-2401, Vehicle Bomb Mitigation Guide (VBMG) (FOUO), for recommendations on increasing protection against vehicle bombs.  Both  publications  may  be  accessed  on  the  USACE  website  at https://pdc.usace.army.mil.  Follow  the  application  instructions  to  obtain  a userid and password. The following paragraphs present techniques that may be used to  mitigate  effects  of blast/fragmentation on facilities in the expeditionary environment.  Figure 4.27. Expeditionary Structures.  in  conjunction  with  standoff  distances                             51 4.4.2.1. Orientation. Buildings and structures may be oriented in a manner to help  reduce  effects  of  blast  on  the  structure.  Tests  have  shown  that  structures oriented  with the smaller dimension of the structure facing the direction of an anticipated blast (e.g., perimeter fence, ECP, etc.) receive less damage than with the larger dimension facing the direction of an anticipated blast. Also, tests with vehicle bombs have shown that the primary blast field from the explosion tends to be outwards from both sides of the vehicle, while the primary fragmentation field tends to travel more to the front and rear of the vehicle, as shown in Figure 4.28.  For  more  details  on  vehicle  bombs  and  their  effects  on  all  types  of structures,  including  expeditionary  structures,  refer  to  AFH  10-2401.  That handbook also provides safe standoff distances to defeat and mitigate the effects of vehicle bombs. This information may be used to determine how best to orient facilities during site setup. If possible, doors and windows are faced in a manner that does not provide a direct line of sight from outside the perimeter. If this is not  possible,  cover  the  windows  and  consider  using  obscuration  screening  to block visual access to the facility or structure.  Figure 4.28. Blast and Fragmentation Hazard Zones.   4.4.2.2.  Clustering  and  Dispersal.  Making  the  determination  to  cluster  or disperse  assets  can  be  based  on  several  factors.  Because  each  tactic  has  both positive  and  negative  aspects,  the  planner  strikes  a  careful  balance  between efficiency and survivability, with emphasis on survivability. Grouping high-risk                            52 activities  and  concentrating  personnel  and  critical  functions  in  a  cluster  may provide opportunities to maximize standoff distances, reduce the perimeter area, minimize access points, and create defensible space. Conversely, asset dispersal is  often  necessary  due  to  the  difficulty  of  hardening  most  temporary  and expeditionary structures. Dispersal is a form of passive defense that may be used to lessen the possibility of numerous critical assets being damaged or destroyed in a single attack. This effort would be used in addition to other measures such as  standoff  distance,  revetments,  screening,  and  barriers.  Asset  dispersal  may have  an  isolating  effect  that  reduces  effectiveness  of  existing  security provisions, increases complexity of emergency response, and creates more space to  defend.  The  tradeoff  between  dispersing  assets  (past  the  minimum  standoff distance)  and  grouping  them  is  analyzed.  This  is  a  risk  management  decision made  by  the  site  commander  using results  of  threat  assessments,  vulnerability assessments,  criticality  assessments,  and  recommendations  from  intelligence personnel,  security  forces,  civil  engineers,  and  other  members  of  the  staff. Regardless of where priority assets are located, CE provides physical protection based  on  the  threat.  Reference  AFH  10-222,  Volume  1,  Civil  Engineer  Bare Base Development, for additional information on facility dispersal options.  4.4.2.3.  Hardening.  Hardening  temporary  and  expeditionary  structures  can  be difficult or impractical because these structures are designed to be mobile. These structures  offer  limited  protection  from  threats  when  compared  to  permanent facilities.  Some  degree  of  protection  may  be  achieved  by  hardening  the structures perimeter. Figure 4.29 is an example of a compacted soil berm used to protect a structure. Other earth-filled barriers such as concertainer walls and sandbags  may  also  be  employed to  protect  expeditionary  structures. Fragmentation  barriers  provide  some  degree  of  protection  from  impacting primary and secondary debris. These barriers work extremely well for fragment protection;  however,  they  do  not  reduce  blast  damage  significantly  for conventional and expeditionary structures. Concrete barriers of sufficient height may  be  effective  in  stopping  primary  debris.  However,  barriers  may  also become  secondary  debris  hazards  (debris  from  the  barrier  itself)  in  the immediate  area  of  an  explosion,  causing  additional  damage  to  the  asset  being protected. AFH 10-222, Volume 14 contains information on specific  materials and techniques that may be used to harden facilities and other assets.                                        Figure 4.29. Compacted Soil Revetment.   53   4.4.2.4.  Windows.  Windows  are  usually  the  weakest  part  of  a  structure.  Glass fragments  caused  by  blasts  may  result  in  significant  injuries.  Although expeditionary  structures  usually  do  not  contain  glass  windows,  host-nation facilities  occupied  by  US  forces  may  in  fact  contain  glass  windows.  When possible, windows can be covered using plywood or other protective material. If not possible, other methods may be used to reduce hazards from broken glass. Installation of fragment-retention film (Figure 4.30) is a plastic (polyester) sheet of film adhered to the glass with special adhesive. This modification helps keep glass fragments together preventing them from causing severe injury and possibly death. Heavy drapes or a “catcher bar” (metal bar installed across the window) may help prevent large piece(s) of glass being held together by the retention film from  flying  through  the  room  and  causing  blunt  trauma  injury.  Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 1110-3-501, Windows Retrofit Using Fragment Retention Film  with  Catcher  Bar  System,  contains  details  on  retrofitting  windows  using fragment retention film. A trained engineer analyzes several factors (i.e., potential charge  weight,  standoff  distance,  size  of  glass  pane,  thickness  and  type  of window glass, attachment of the pane to the window frame, and attachment of the frame  to  the  structure)  to  determine  if  windows  can  be  properly  retrofitted. Protective film in the expeditionary environment is a last resort. As stated earlier, it is preferable to cover windows with plywood or other protective material.                             Figure 4.30. Fragmentation Retention Film.  54  its  capability to  generate  fragmented  projectiles, 4.4.2.5.  Compartmentalization.  Compartmentalization  (Figure  4.31)  is  a technique used to reduce casualties in highly populated facilities, such as dining and recreation facilities. It involves a series of interconnected walls designed to divide large areas into smaller protected areas to limit casualties from impacts of rockets, artillery, and mortars. Since the primary threat of a fragmenting weapon is the  objective  of compartmentalization  is  to  contain  these  fragmentation  effects.  Tests  and analyses have also shown that significant blast hazard do not generally extend beyond  the  compartment  in  which  the  weapon  detonates.  In  addition  to compartmentalization,  fragmentation  barriers  are  constructed  around the facility’s  exterior  to  mitigate  blast  and  fragmentation  from  near  misses.  The minimum  height  for  interior  walls  and  exterior  walls  is  5  feet  and  8  feet, respectively.  Figure 4.31. Example of Compartmentalization.   4.4.2.6. Pre-detonation Screens. Pre-detonation screens are structures built and placed in front of assets to cause anti-tank rounds to detonate before reaching its intended  target  (Figure  4.32).  Pre-detonation  screens  may  consist  of  wood                           55 fences, chain-link fencing, expanded metal mesh, or heavy woven-fiber fabric. Wood fences may be constructed of wood slats or plywood panels a minimum of 3/8-inch (9.4 mm) thick. If made of slats, spacing is no more than 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) apart. Spaces in metal fabric screens are 2 inches (50 mm) by 2 inches (50 mm)  maximum and fabric a  minimum of 9 gauge (3.8 mm).  A direct fire weapon striking a pre-detonation screen either detonates on impact or is dudded. The residual effects of a pre-detonated round on a building are more severe than the  effects  of  a  dudded  round.  After  pre-detonation,  the  weapon’s  jet  and  the spent rocket engine from the rocket-propelled grenade continue past the screen. The screen is located away from the  wall at a standoff distance appropriate to the wall construction. For most materials, this is a minimum of 40 feet (10 m). However, it is best to consult UFC 4-020-03FA for details on construction and standoff distances for pre-detonation screens.  Figure 4.32. Pre-Detonation Screening.    4.4.3. Revetments.  Revetments are simply  walls  used to  reduce the effects of blast  or  fragmentation  on  facilities  and  equipment  resulting  from  near  miss rockets, artillery, and mortars. They are used to protect parked aircraft or other high-value resources. These  structures are also referred to  as  fragmentation or blast  walls.  Revetments  may  be  constructed  of  different  materials  and configured  in  multiple  ways  for  multiple  purposes  as  shown  in  Figure  4.33. Engineers  identify  revetment  requirements  through  their  servicing  logistics function and theater CE staff. Refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 14 for construction                            56 details  and  an  overview  of  the  different  types  of  revetments.  The  JFOB Protection Handbook also contains revetment information.  Figure 4.33. Revetments.    4.4.4. Personnel Protective Shelters. In the event of an attack or when attacks are imminent,  personnel  quickly  evacuate  expeditionary-type  structures. Hardened protective shelters (bunkers) with overhead protection (Figure 4.34) are  constructed  strategically  throughout  the  site,  particularly  near  primary gathering  buildings  and  where  large  numbers  of  personnel  live  and  work. Shelters  provide  protection  against  direct  and  indirect  weapons  fire.  Sidewall barriers  may  be  constructed  using  sandbags,  earth-filled  container  structures, earth-filled  wire  mesh  bastions,  or  concrete  walls.  Sidewalls  need  to  be  thick enough to resist direct fire weapons or a near miss from an indirect fire weapon. Covers are made capable of supporting the dead weight from sandbags or earth-filled  containers.  Only  bunker  designs  approved  by  the  USACE’s  Engineer Research Development Center are constructed. Pre-detonation screens can also be placed above the shelter to cause a weapon to detonate upon impact, thereby reducing  the  effects  upon  the  bunker.  Detailed  information  on  personnel protective  shelters  can  be  found  in  the  JFOB  Protection  Handbook;  AFH  10-222, Volume 14; the USACE’s website; and the TCMS software.                            Figure 4.34. Personnel Protective Shelter.  57    4.4.5.  Utilities.  Vulnerability  assessments  usually  assess  the  potential  for aggressors to damage, destroy, or tamper with site utilities, particularly at those sites where utility lines cross the site perimeter. In addition to screening, sealing, and  securing  utility  lines  to  prevent  unauthorized  access  engineers  focus  on providing  redundant  utility  service,  eliminating  vulnerabilities  identified  in relation to the threat, and securing all utility production and distribution systems.  4.4.5.1.  Electrical  Power.  Power  plants  (Figure  4.35)  are  one  of  the  most critical assets  in the expeditionary environment. Protect power plant resources with (entanglements), camouflage,  and  berming.  Depending  upon  the  population  and  size  of  the installation,  power  plant  dispersal  (having  two  or  more  plants  established  and interconnected)  may  be  an  option  to  ensure  some  degree  of  power  generation redundancy  after  an  attack.  Also,  power  distribution  cables  are  buried  12-18 inches  and  spaced  at  least  6  inches  apart.  Position  mobile  electrical  power generators near critical facilities and assets they support and harden them against attack.  For  details  on  power  plant  installation,  see  AFH  10-222,  Volume  5, Guide to Contingency Electrical Power System Installation.  revetments,  barriers,  concertina  or  barbed  wire                           58 Figure 4.35. Expeditionary Power Plant at Camp Victory, Iraq.    4.4.5.2. Water Production and Supply. Water sources, water purification and distribution equipment, and water supplies are kept under constant surveillance and  tested  frequently  for  contamination.  Water  transfer  pipes  may  be  tapped under pressure providing aggressors the opportunity to introduce contaminants into  the  water  supply.  Civil  engineers  work  closely  with  Bioenvironmental Engineering,  Public  Health, and  Safety  personnel  to  ensure  water  supplies  are protected  from  intentional  or  unintentional  contamination.  Water  sources  are guarded, water production equipment reveted, and water lines buried at the first opportunity (Figure 4.36). Roving patrols establish surveillance points to alert personnel  to  the  possibility  of  tampering.  An  emergency  response  plan  is developed  in  the  event  the  water  supply  is  contaminated.  The  plan  includes  a map  indicating  the  location  of  all  potential  water  sources,  water  production equipment,  water  storage  areas,  and  alternative  approaches  to  supplying  safe water  (e.g.,  boiling,  special treatment,  alternative  water  supply  points, procedures  for  having  bottled  water  brought  in  from  other  sources,  etc.).  For further specific guidance on CE responsibilities related to FP of water sources and establishing and maintaining a potable water production capability refer to AFMAN  10-246,  Food  and  Water  Protection  Program;  Air  Force  Pamphlet (AFPAM)  10-219,  Volume  5,  Bare  Base  Conceptual  Planning;  and  AFMAN 48-138_IP, Sanitary Control and Surveillance of Field Water Supplies.                             Figure 4.36. Burying Utility Lines.  59   4.4.6. Camouflage and Concealment. Camouflage and concealment are tactics used to enhance FP. Use whatever natural or artificial materials are available to hide, blend, and disguise potential military targets. The key to camouflage is to alter the appearance of the asset being protected in a manner where it becomes part  of  the  natural  background.  Natural  cover  could  include  materials  such  as trees,  brush,  grass,  leaves,  rocks  or  boulders.  When  using  natural  cover  for concealment, be careful not to disturb the look of the natural surroundings. Use materials commonly found in the area where an asset is to be concealed. Also, natural  cover,  such  as  brush  and  leaves,  need  to  be  changed  whenever  its appearance  no  longer  looks  natural  and  begins  to  change  from  that  of  its surroundings. Artificial cover could include burlap or netting applied to critical assets as shown in Figure 4.37. Military assets can also be painted in a manner so  that  the  asset  blends  in  with  the  surrounding  area.  Camouflaging  and concealing assets in a desert  environment can be challenging. In the end, it  is creativity  and  ingenuity  that  lead  to  effective  disguises.  Camouflage  and concealment tactics are used after hardening and cover are applied to the assets to be protected. Refer to AFH 10-222, Volume 10, Civil Engineer Camouflage, Concealment, and Deception Measures, for more information.                           60 Figure 4.37. Camouflage Netting Being Applied.    4.4.7.  Contract  Support.  Once  hostilities  subside  and  initial  beddown  phase moves  towards  sustainment,  contract  support  is  available  to  implement  and sustain  base  support  operations  (Figure  4.38).  This  capability  allows  military forces to focus more exclusively on achieving military objectives. The Air Force Contract  Augmentation  Program  (AFCAP)  is  a  contingency  contract  vehicle established as a force multiplier option to augment CE and services capabilities during  worldwide  contingency  planning  and  deployment  operations.  AFCAP may provide construction support at overseas locations and can support recovery operations  after  natural  disasters,  accidents,  or  terrorist  attacks.  The  Navy’s Global  Contingency  Construction  and  Global  Contingency  Services  contracts are  designed  to  provide  worldwide  construction  and  engineering  services  in response to  natural disasters,  military conflicts,  humanitarian assistance, and a wide range of military operations unrelated to conflicts. The US Army Materiel Command  (USAMC)  support  contract,  Logistics  Contract  Augmentation Program or LOGCAP, provides engineering, construction, and general logistic services.  USAMC  is  supported  by  USACE  for  engineering  and  construction contract  management  and  by  the  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency  for logistic  services  contract  administration.  Contact  the  Major  Command  Civil Engineer or Air Force Civil Engineer Center for contract support assistance.                            61 Figure 4.38. LOGCAP Power Support at Camp Taji, Iraq.                  62 Chapter 5  INTEGRATED DEFENSE   5.1. Overview. Integrated Defense (ID) is the integration of active and passive, offensive  and  defensive  capabilities,  to  mitigate  potential  risks  and  defeat adversary threats to  AF operations.  ID employs a  number of capabilities in a variety of ways to produce desired effects in the base defense battle space.  This includes  the  base  boundary,  base  security  zone,  and  the  base  perimeter.    This strategy  leverages  assigned  resources  against  adaptive  threats  to  protect resources  and  personnel.  This  chapter  outlines  actions  civil  engineers  take  to support effective application of the ID concept.  5.2. Integrated Defense Concept. One of the most vital capabilities a base has to counter threats, especially in an expeditionary environment, is the ability to apply an ID concept (Figure 5.1).  Civil engineers are trained to be familiar with the  FP  terminology  that  describes  the  defense  battlespace  of  the  base,  both inside and outside the wire. AFH 31-109, Integrated Defense in Expeditionary Environments, describes the base perimeter as basically the fenced area of the base. It shows the physical and legal demarcation of the installation, that only authorized  personnel  may  occupy,  and  is  usually  made  obvious  to  the  general public so inadvertent penetration is avoided. The base boundary (BB) is the line that  delineates  the  surface  area  of  the  base  for  the  purpose  of  facilitating coordination  and  deconfliction  of  operations  between  adjacent  (and  usually friendly) units. It includes key terrain that is secured through active control by security forces or coordination with host nation forces. The base security zone (BSZ) is an AF unique term used to describe the area outside the base perimeter from which base personnel, resources, or aircraft approaching/departing the base may be vulnerable to standoff threats (e.g.  mortars, rockets, and  man portable aerial defense systems).                                    63 Figure 5.1. AF Integrated Defense Concept.    5.2.1. Actions and Effects. Essential actions and effects of the ID concept are those  deemed  critical  to  successful  planning,  programing,  and  combat  support operations execution. Successful ID effects depend on the prevailing threat, the operating environment, friendly forces available, rules of engagement, and other factors that characterize the battlespace. ID is planned and executed based upon the estimated threat (or combination of threats) and operating environment, and is approved by the Installation Commander.  5.2.2.  Integrated  Defense  Risk  Management  Process  (IDRMP).  The analytical tool used to achieve ID is the IDRMP, for the Installation Commander to manage risks based upon the association of the criticality of assigned assets and  infrastructure,  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  threat  and  the  respective vulnerabilities to those assets. ID is employed at all garrisons and expeditionary locations.  5.3.  Desired  ID  Effects.  Conducting  ID  is  accomplished  by  achieving  nine desired effects. These effects are:  anticipate, deter, detect, assess, warn, defeat, delay,  defend,  and  recover  from  threats  or  hostile  actions  to  resources.  ID measures  ensure  that  unauthorized  access  to  resources  is  denied  before  their seizure, loss, damage or destruction. AFI 31-101, defines the desired ID effects toolkit.                           64  5.3.1. Anticipation. Anticipating the enemy is the critical first step Anticipation involves determining options, intentions, and actions an adversary might take, to intelligently  prepare  the  operational  environment  in  order  to  respond.  Civil engineers  employ  and  implement  FP  measures  during  site  layout  and  site buildup  based  on  the  threat  identified  by  the  intelligence  community;  not  just threats in general.  5.3.2.  Deterrence.  The  goal  of  deterrence  is  to  discourage  adversaries  from taking  offensive  action  by  making  the  consequences  for  their  actions  clear.  In addition to consistent execution of RAMs, civil engineers support deterrence by employing obstacles and barriers, hardening facilities, and posting warning signs shown in Table 5.2 to make adversaries understand that a successful attack is unlikely.  Table 5.1. Threat Deterrence.  Base Boundary and Base Security Zone Deter  threat  activity  through  active  community  policing  (e.g.,  Eagle  Eyes Program),  boundary  and  internal  circulation  control,  controlled  area  marking, prudent physical security measures. Installation Perimeters Deter  threats  by  presenting  a  strong,  professional,  perceptively  impenetrable physical  boundary  free  of  foliage  or  objects  (e.g.,  trees)  that  might  allow surreptitious access. Installation Entry Control Points threats  by  presenting  predictably  stringent  screening  TTP  and Deter unpredictable searches of vehicles/persons entering installations. Physical Security Requirements Deter threat actions through the use of warning signs, barriers, fencing; make the threat’s goal too costly and risky.  5.3.3. Detection. Detection can be enhanced by employing TTPs that allow us to become aware of an enemy's covert attempts. Several ways to enhance detection include  the  use  of  electronic  surveillance  systems,  security  lighting,  chemical, biological,  radiological,  and  nuclear  detection  equipment,  and  alarm  systems. Also, constructing elevated observation posts provides security personnel with a                         65 clear view of all areas on the site and the surrounding clear zone, see Table 5.2. In  addition,  routine  checks  of  critical  equipment  such  as  power  and  water production  equipment,  storage  and  distribution  equipment,  and  the  like  are conducted to quickly uncover any evidence of tampering.  Table 5.2. Threat Detection.  Base Boundary and Base Security Zone Detect threats through the use of lighting, IDS, early warning systems (EWS), closed-circuit television, etc. Installation Perimeters threats’  attempts Detect to  exploit  perimeters  by  establishing  well-lit, sufficiently observed physical boundaries. Thorough discussion of detection is in AFH 31-109. Installation Entry Control Points Detect threats by proper ID vetting, vehicle searches, and sentries’ cognizance for threat surveillance. Physical Security Requirements Detect  threats  in  time  to  respond  appropriately  through  use  of  lighting,  IDS, EWS,  vegetation  control  (clear  zones),  physical  security  checks,  host nation/exterior community networking, robust Eagle Eyes Program integration, listening posts, observation posts, internal circulation controls, RAMs, etc.  5.3.4. Assessment. As stated in Chapter 2, an assessment of the critical assets, threat  and  vulnerability  is  conducted  to  calculate  the  overall  risk  (risk assessment)  to  determine  how  best  to  employ  defensive  measures.  These assessments are conducted by a group of subject matter experts (SME), such as the  local  Threat  Working  Group  (TWG).  This  assessment  helps  develop strategies  leveraging  finite  resources  against  adaptive  threats  to  protect  assets. Otherwise,  time  and  material  could  be  wasted  in  an  effort  to  provide  total protection for every asset, which is not practical.  5.3.5.  Warn.  Warn  friendly  forces  of  adversary  activity  primarily  through  the IDS  and  EWS.  Additional  systems  such  as  mass  notification,  radio,  public address,  commander’s  access  channels,  voice,  hand  and  arm  signals,  cellular telephones, instant messenger, short message system texting, etc., also provide warning.                                                      66  5.3.6. Defeat. Defeat threats through appropriate, timely, progressive application of force; using a layered application of barriers, obstacles, technology, physical security measures and forces (defense-in-depth). Integration of steel cabling or other  barriers;  reinforce  physical  boundaries  which  aides  defeating  penetrative VBIED threats. Additional defeat techniques are discussed in AFH 31-109.  5.3.7. Delay. Forcing a delay in an adversary's actions increases the risks for the adversary  and  provides  security  personnel  time  to  react  and  respond.  Tactical guidance states that delay cannot be achieved unless there is depth to ID. The obstacles and elements of security are employed in layers, forcing the adversary to breach several layers of defense (active and passive) to reach a certain target as shown in Table 5.3. The concept of defense in depth does not rely on a single failure point, but rather employs different types of defenses and redundancies to ensure a nearly impenetrable perimeter. Early identification of a threat increases the capability to quickly make a determination of intent and neutralize the threat by applying multiple defensive measures. An example of layered defense would be the ECF zone concept covered in Chapter 4. The ECF is laid out in zones, where security personnel perform different functions. As vehicles move through the zones (approach, access, response, etc.), certain security measures are taken. An attempt to breach the ECF would be immediately noticeable and would give security personnel time to detect and react to the attempt and employ a range of measures  to  stop  the  vehicle,  using  the  appropriate  level  of  force  up  to  and including deadly force if necessary in the response zone. Civil engineers work closely  with  intelligence  and  security  personnel  to  determine  how  best  to establish a layered defense and employ the techniques covered in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.  Table 5.3. Threat Delay.  Base Boundary and Base Security Zone Delay adversaries using a layers application of barriers, obstacles, technology, physical security measures, and forces (defense-in-depth). Installation Perimeters Delay  threats  in  order  to  increase  likelihood  of  detection  and  allow  friendly forces to respond as needed. Delaying techniques are further discussed in AFH 31-109.  67 Delay adversaries until additional friendly forces can be massed to defeat them. Installation Entry Control Points Physical Security Requirements Delay  the  threat’s  access  to  facilities,  assets,  and  areas  through  the  use  of fencing, barriers, locks, and hasps.  5.3.8.  Defend.  Defend  assets  through  threat-and  effects-based  planning  and analysis  that  integrate  all  friendly  forces  into  a  single,  comprehensive  plan. Integrate all  friendly forces into the defense plan and ensure all personnel are trained  and  qualified  on  arming,  rules  of  engagement,  use  of  force,  and expeditionary skills. Perimeter defense is critical to defending the installation by integrating with other perimeter defense forces.  5.3.9. Recover. After an enemy withdraws or has been defeated recovery from adversarial  events  is  applied  through  effective  command  and  control,  and executing  the  installation  emergency  management  plan  10-2.

A physical boundary will be considered as a sufficient means to channel vehicles to the access control points. At a minimum, access control at a controlled perimeter requires the demonstrated capability to search  for  and  detect  explosives.  Where  the  controlled  perimeter  includes  a shoreline and there is no defined perimeter beyond the shoreline, the boundary will be at the mean high water mark. Counterintelligence—Information gathered and activities conducted to protect against  espionage,  other  intelligence  activities,  sabotage,  or  assassinations conducted by or on behalf of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign organizations,  foreign  persons,  or  international  terrorist  activities.

(AFI 10-245) Giant  Voice  System—A  system  typically  installed  as  a  base-wide  system  to provide  a  siren  signal  and  pre-recorded  and  live  voice  messages.  It  is  most useful  for  providing  mass  notification  for  personnel  in  outdoor  areas, expeditionary structures, and temporary buildings. It is generally not suitable for mass notification to personnel in permanent structures because of the difficulty in achieving acceptable intelligibility of voice messages. Improvised  Explosive  Device  (IED)—A  device  placed  or  fabricated    in  an improvised    manner  incorporating  destructive,  lethal,  noxious,  pyrotechnic,  or incendiary  chemicals  designed  to    destroy,  incapacitate,  harass,    or  distract.  It may  incorporate  military  stores,  but  is  normally  devised  from  nonmilitary components. Also called IED. (JP 1-02) Inhabited Building—Buildings or portions of buildings routinely occupied by 11 or more DOD personnel and  with a population density  of greater than one person per 40 gross square meters (430 gross square feet). This density generally                                      75 through  observation, excludes industrial, maintenance, and storage facilities, except for more densely populated  portions  of  those  buildings,  such  as  administrative  areas.  The inhabited  building  designation  also  applies  to  expeditionary  and  temporary structures with similar population densities. (UFC 4-010-01) Integrated  Defense—The  integration  of  multidisciplinary  active  and  passive, offensive  and  defensive  capabilities,  employed  to  mitigate  potential  risks  and defeat adversary threats to AF operations. (AFI 31-101) Intelligence—1.)

(AFI 10-245 & AFI 31-101) Internal Security—Measures used to protect personnel or assets located on the interior of the base. Level of Protection—The degree to which an asset is protected against injury or damage. This would include personnel and equipment. Levels of protection can be defined as low, medium, or high. For a low level of protection, the structure would be near collapse, a medium level of protection would result in a damaged but repairable structure, and a high level of protection would cause superficial damage to the structure. Selecting the level of protection means trading-off an acceptable level of risk. Mass Notification System—A system that provides real-time information to all building occupants or personnel in the immediate vicinity of the building during emergency situations. Obscuration Screen—A physical structure or some other element used to block the line of sight to a potential target.

Physical  Security—That  part  of  security  concerned  with  physical  measures designed to safeguard personnel; to prevent unauthorized access to equipment,                                     76 installations, material, and documents; and to safeguard them against espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft. (JP 3-0)  Pre-detonation  Screen—A  structure  designed  to  protect  a  critical  asset  by causing  a  weapon  to  detonate  prior  to  hitting  the  primary  target,  causing  its effect to dissipate in the distance between the screen and the target. Primary Gathering Building—Inhabited buildings routinely occupied by 50 or more DOD personnel. This designation applies to the entire portion of a building that  meets  the  population  density  requirements  for  an  inhabited  building.  For example, an inhabited portion of the building that has an area within it with 50 or  more  personnel  is  a  primary  gathering  building  for  the  entire  inhabited portion of the building. The primary gathering building designation also applies to  expeditionary  and  temporary  structures  with  similar  populations  and population  densities  and  to  family  housing  with  13  or  more  family  units  per building, regardless of population or population density. Random Antiterrorism Measures—Random,  multiple  security  measures  that consistently  change  the  look  of  a  site's  force  protection  posture  and  introduce uncertainty  into  the  site's  overall  force  protection  program.  These  measures make it difficult for terrorists to predict actions or discern patterns or routines. Risk Management—The process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks arising  from  operational  factors  and  making  decisions  that  balance  risk  costs with mission benefits. Also called RM. See also risk. (JP 3-0) Standoff  Distance—A  distance  maintained  between  a  building  or  portion thereof and the potential location for an explosive detonation. Temporary  Structures—Structures  erected  with  an  expected  occupancy  of three years or less.

Terrorism—The unlawful use of violence or threat of violence, often motivated by  religious,  political,  or  other  ideological  beliefs,  to  instill  fear  and  coerce governments or societies in pursuit of goals that are usually political. See also antiterrorism;  combating  terrorism;  counterterrorism;  force  protection condition.  (JP  3-07.2).  The  calculated  use  of  unlawful  violence  or  threat  of unlawful  violence  to  inculcate  fear;  intended  to  coerce  or  to  intimidate                                     77 governments  or  societies  in  the  pursuit  of  goals  that  are  generally  political, religious, or ideological. (AFI 10-245) Terrorist—An individual who commits an act or acts of violence or threatens violence in pursuit of political, religious, or ideological objectives. (AFI 10-245) Terrorism Threat Level (TTL)—An intelligence threat assessment of the level of terrorist threat faced by U.S. personnel and interests. The assessment is based on a continuous intelligence analysis of a minimum of four elements: terrorist group  operational  capability,  intentions,  activity  and  operational  environment. There  are  four  threat  levels:  LOW,  MODERATE,  SIGNIFICANT  and  HIGH. Threat levels must not be confused with FPCONs. Threat-level assessments are provided  to  senior  leaders  to  assist  them  in  determining  the  appropriate  local FPCON. (AFI 10-245) Terrorist  Group—Any  number  of  terrorists  who  assemble  together,  have  a unifying relationship, or are organized for the purpose of committing an act or acts of  violence or threatens  violence in pursuit of their political, religious, or ideological objectives. (AFI 10-245) Terrorist Threat Level—A DOD intelligence threat assessment of the level of terrorist  threat  faced  by  US  personnel  and  interests  in  a  foreign  country;  the levels are expressed as LOW, MODERATE, SIGNIFICANT, and HIGH. (JP 3-07.2) Threat  Assessment—In  antiterrorism,  examining  the  capabilities,  intentions, and activities, past and present, of terrorist organizations as well as the security environment  within  which  friendly  forces  operate  to  determine  the  level  of threat. Also called TA. (JP 3-07.2) Vulnerability—1. The susceptibility of a nation or military force to any action by any means through which its war potential or combat effectiveness may be reduced  or  its  will  to  fight  diminished.  (JP  1-02)    In  AT,  a  situation  or circumstance which, if left unchanged, may result in the loss of life or damage to mission-essential  resources.  It  includes  the  characteristics  of  an  installation, system,  asset,  application,  or  its  dependencies  that  could  cause  it  to  suffer  a degradation or loss (incapacity to perform its designated function) as a result of having been subjected to a certain level of threat or hazard. (AFI 10-245) Vulnerability  Assessment—A  DOD,  command,  or  unit-level  evaluation (assessment) to determine the vulnerability of an installation, unit, exercise, port, ship,  residence,  facility,  or  other  site  to  a  terrorist  attack.  Identifies  areas  of                                     78 improvement to withstand, mitigate, or deter acts of violence or terrorism. Also called VA. (JP 3-07.2)      79 Attachment 2  SITE SELECTION AND LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS to  A2.1.  Site  Selection.  It  may  not  be  possible  to  select  sites  that  meet  all requirements  needed implement  effective  force  protection  measures; nevertheless, a list of considerations can be developed and used during the site selection  process.  Keep  the  following  force  protection  considerations  in  mind when selecting beddown sites:  A2.1.1. Consider the threat throughout the entire site selection process.  A2.1.2. Consider minimum AT standards established by DOD and whether the site supports or inhibits efforts to attain and maintain AT standards.  A2.1.3.  Consider  force  protection  standards  established  by  the  CCDR  and whether  the  site  supports  or  inhibits  efforts  to  attain  and  maintain  these standards.  A2.1.4.  Select  a  site  that  provides  the  opportunity  to  maximize  standoff distances.  A2.1.5. Select beddown areas that are away from public roads and uncontrolled areas.  A2.1.6.  Avoid  areas  where  terrain  features  provide  adversaries  with  too  many vantage points.  A2.1.7. Avoid areas that do not provide sufficient standoff distances.  A2.1.8.  Consider  future  need  for  additional  space  to  support  a  population increase.  A2.1.9.  Consider  future  need  to  increase  standoff  distances  as  a  result  of increased threat levels.                                       80 A2.1.10.  Consider  space  needed  for  protective  construction  (i.e.,  bunkers, overwatch towers, defensive fighting positions, revetments, sidewall protection, blast and fragmentation barriers, vehicle barriers, perimeter barriers, etc.).  A2.1.11. Consider the need to establish a defense-in-depth posture for integrated base defense.  A2.1.12. Consider adjacent land use and direct lines of sight or access to the site.  A2.1.13. Consider the need to modify terrain outside the established perimeter to provide clear zones and eliminate potential hiding places.  A2.1.14. Consider support needed from the local area (i.e., utilities, sanitation, indigenous  materials,  equipment,  etc.)  and  how  this  impacts  force  protection efforts.  A2.1.15. Consider site elevation to deny advantage for potential aggressors (i.e., lines of sight, targeting opportunities, etc.).  A2.1.16.  Consider  retrofits  of  existing  facilities  to  meet  minimum  local  AT standards.  A2.1.17. Evaluate potential use of existing roads to enhance FP efforts.  A2.1.18. Consider the need to establish separate ECPs for delivery vehicles.  A2.1.19. Consider the need for vehicle queue space and search pits.  A2.1.20. Consider the need to disperse key facilities and critical assets.  A2.1.21.  Select  a  site  that  lends  itself  to  establishing  an  effective  controlled perimeter.  A2.1.22. Consider the need to bury utility lines.  A2.1.23. Consider the need to orient facilities to avoid direct line of sight from the perimeter.                                       81  A2.1.24. Consider the need to position high-value facilities and assets near the center of the site.  A2.2. Site Layout. Key elements to consider during site layout include standoff distances,  layered  security,  number  and  location  of  ECPs,  redundant  utilities, protection  of  all  key  assets,  ammunition  storage,  hazardous  material  and hazardous  waste  storage,  and  protective  shelters  throughout  the  site.  Maintain maps  that  indicate,  in  detail,  where  every  asset  will  be  placed  and  where  all protective  construction  (i.e.,  revetments,  bunkers,  etc.)  will  take  place.  Also consider the following elements during site layout.  A2.2.1. Use the threat assessment when determining how best to site facilities in relation to existing roads and the controlled perimeter.  A2.2.2.  Consider  minimum  AT  standards  established  by  DOD  when  siting facilities and critical assets.  A2.2.3. Consider force protection standards established by CCDRs when siting facilities and critical assets.  A2.2.4.  Maximize  standoff  distance  between  the  controlled  perimeter  and inhabited buildings and other key assets.  A2.2.5.  Limit  ECPs  to  an  absolute  minimum,  and  establish  a  separate  entry control  points  for  trucks  and  delivery  vehicles  at  an  appreciable  standoff distance from inhabited facilities and other key assets.  A2.2.6.  Consider  terrain,  elevation,  and  available  space  when  siting  the  ECF. Include  space  for  approach  zones,  access  zones,  and  response  zones,  queue space; parking space, and space for vehicle search pits. Use AFH 10-2401 and UFC 4-022-01 as guidance for ECF layout.  A.2.2.7.  Clear  dense  vegetation  around  the  perimeter  that  may  be  used  by adversaries to camouflage or conceal themselves while conducting surveillance, attempting to gain access to the site, or targeting priority assets.                                        82 A2.2.8.  Avoid  straight-line  roads  or  roads  that  are  perpendicular  to  critical facilities or assets.  A2.2.9. Construct berms and ditches to enhance perimeter security.  A2.2.10.  Avoid  siting  structures  and  critical  equipment  in  areas  where  terrain offers  vantage  points  from  which  adversaries  might  target  facilities  and  other critical assets.  A2.2.11. Site key  facilities and critical assets towards the center of the site to attain maximum standoff distance from the perimeter.  A2.2.12. Provide redundant utility systems and bury all utility lines.  A2.2.13. If the threat  warrants, disperse facilities and key  assets  to reduce the possibility of collateral damage to multiple assets from a single attack.  A2.2.14. If key assets can be better protected if clustered and FP resources are available to increase their level of protection, consider this option.  A2.2.15.  Orient  facilities  in  a  manner  that  reduces  a  direct  line  of  sight  from outside the perimeter and in a manner that limits the amount of damage from a blast (the end of a facility faces the area of the potential blast versus the sides facing the area of the potential blast).  A2.2.16.  Compartmentalize  primary  gathering  facilities  to  limit  damage  and injuries from fragmenting weapons in the event of an attack.  A2.2.17.  Determine  appropriate  areas  to  site  revetments  and  other  protective structures  (blast/fragmentation  walls)  (e.g.,  critical  assets  and  key  primary gathering facilities, etc.).  A2.2.18.  Site  facilities  that  receive  bulk  deliveries  and  other  structures  more vulnerable to an attack (e.g., industrial areas, hazardous waste/hazardous storage areas,  refuse  collection  areas,  etc.)  in  areas  away  from  the  main  inhabited portion of the site. These areas still need to be secured.                                        83 A2.2.19. Assist security personnel in constructing layers of defense to support the ID effort.  A2.2.20. Ensure parking areas are constructed to provide the minimum standoff distance from facilities as determined by DOD standards or the CCDR.  A2.2.21.  Select  areas  for  siting  trash  containers  at  least  10m/33ft  away  from facilities and other key assets.  A2.2.22. Site personnel bunkers strategically throughout the site (particularly in highly populated areas) to provide shelter in the event of an attack.  A2.2.23. Site MNS components in areas so that voice notification may be heard throughout the entire site.  A2.2.24. Outline a plan to apply hardening, camouflage, and concealment to all key facilities and critical assets once sited.  A2.2.25.  Outline  a  plan  to  construct  obscuration  screens  and  pre-detonation screens, and install window film application to lessen the severity of damage to key facilities/assets in the event of an attack.
