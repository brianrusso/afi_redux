Applicability  .    This  AFI  applies  to  Regular  Air  Force  (RegAF),  civilian,  Air  National Guard  (ANG)  and  AF  Reserve  (AFR)  personnel  assigned  to  positions  where  security  work,  as defined by the Office of Personnel  Management’s Security Administration (occupational  series 0080) classification standards, is performed as a primary duty (50 percent or more). 1.2.  Overarching  Policy.  It is AF policy to validate the security technical knowledge level of personnel  in  positions  where  security  is  a  primary  duty  through  the  use  of  the  Department  of Defense (DoD) Security Professional Education Development (SPēD) Certification Program. 1.2.1.  The  DoD  SPēD  Certification  Program  is  a  condition  of  employment  for  all  indexed AF employees performing security work as a primary duty as described in para 1.1. 1.2.2.  This  certification  requirement  applies  to  security  employees  hired  or  placed  in  AF indexed positions on or after 14 March 2016.  Incumbent employees assigned on or before 13 March 2016 are not required to participate in the DoD SPēD Certification Program. 1.3.  Program  Characteristics  .    The  SPēD  Certification  Program  is  part  of  a  holistic  DoD effort to professionalize the security workforce. 1.3.1.  The SPēD Certification Program serves as a valid and reliable indicator of employee mastery of facts, concepts, and principles the DoD community deems critical to successfully perform  functions,  implement  programs,  and  pursue  missions  necessary  to  manage  risks  to protect DoD assets. 1.3.2.  The DoD SPēD Certification Program will: 1.3.2.1.  Promote  a  common  and  shared  understanding  of  DoD  security  functional  tasks and the knowledge and skills associated with the competencies required to perform those tasks. 1.3.2.2.  Promote  an  interoperable  and  interchangeable  DoD  security  professional workforce by establishing a uniform process of assessing knowledge and skills. 1.3.2.3.  Establish formal and documented processes for assessing and evaluating whether personnel within the security workforce have acquired the knowledge and skills required to perform assigned security tasks. 1.3.2.4.  Incentivize  long-term  employee  professional  development,  education,  and training  through  a  cyclical  certification  maintenance  process  helping  to  maintain employee technical proficiency and policy knowledge. 1.3.2.5.  Develop  a  workforce  of  certified  security  professionals  capable  of  providing sound  policy-based  guidance  and  support  to  AF  commanders,  directors,  managers, supervisors and leaders. 1.4.  Program  Management.  The DoD SPēD Certification Program is a third party, nationally accredited  workforce  certification  developed  by  and  for  the  DoD  security  community.  The primary  governance  functions  are:  the  accreditation  body,  conferral  authority,  executive  agent, AFI 36-2645  2 FEBRUARY 2017 5 certification  governance  board,  DoD  program  management  office  and  Component  program management office. 1.4.1.

(T-1) 10 AFI 36-2645  2 FEBRUARY 2017 2.9.2.  Should a civilian employee be permanently reassigned via RPA to an indexed CPD or SCPD  (or  equivalent  core  personnel  document)  on  or  after  the  AF  SPēD  program implementation date the employee is required to fulfill all DoD SPēD Certification Program related conditions. (T-1) 2.9.3.  In instances where the employee is assigned to a position requiring more than two (2) SPēD Certifications, the employee will have an extra year per certification to meet program requirements.  For  example:    employee  must  obtain  two  of  the  indexed  SPēD  Certifications within  the  standard  two  year  compliance  window  and  the  additional  certification  may  be obtained during the third year of employment without adverse action or waiver request. (T-1) 2.9.3.1.  AF shall not index more than three DoD SPēD Certifications to any position. (T-1) 2.9.4.  DoD SPēD Certification Program Renewal Standards: 2.9.4.1.  Only  one  certification  maintenance  expiration  date  will  exist  for  each certification holder. (T-0) 2.9.4.2.  All  newly-conferred  certification  holders,  i.e.,  those  who  attain  a  certification after July 1, 2015 will have a static certification expiration date based on conferral date.  Renewal will be calculated as “conferral date + 2 years.” (T-0) 2.9.4.3.  All existing certification holders with more than one certification will have one static  certification  expiration  date  based  on  most  recent  expiration  date.  Renewal  cycle will be calculated as “most recently acquired certification expiration date + 2 years.” (T-0) 2.9.4.4.  A  certification  holder  must  submit  a  certification  renewal  form  prior  to  their expiration date to fulfill certification maintenance requirements. (T-0) 2.9.4.5.  A  certification  holder  is  responsible  for  entering  100  PDUs  of  professional development activities that meet the current maintenance guidelines and categories. (T-0) 2.9.4.6.  A certification holder must accrue 100 PDUs within two years from their static conferral date to successfully meet the professional development requirement. (T-0) 2.9.4.7.  At  least  50  of  the  100  PDUs  must  be  acquired  through  approved  professional development  activities  focusing  on  topic  areas  related  to  security.  The  remaining  PDUs can  be  non-aligned  with  security;  however,  they  must  satisfy  one  or  more  of  the professional development categories identified in Table 4 of this instruction.  (T-0) 2.9.4.8.  If the certification holder has more than one certification and 100 PDUs cannot be achieved by professional development activities, the certification holder must achieve a  passing  score  on  the  most  recently  conferred  certification.  Applies  to  SFPC,  SAPPC, SPIPC, and PSC. (T-0) 2.9.4.8.1.  ISOC  and  SPSC  expirations  are  tied  to  SFPC  and  don’t  have  to  be independently maintained. (T-0) 2.9.4.8.2.  A  certification  holder  will  be  eligible  to  retest  180  days  prior  to  their expiration date. The certification renewal eligibility to retest form will not be visible to  the  certification  holder  before  this  period  is  reached.  A  certification  holder  will AFI 36-2645  2 FEBRUARY 2017 11 only be able to retest their most recently conferred, certification for maintenance. (T-0) 2.9.4.9.  A certification holder who does not accrue 100 PDUs or successfully retests by their biennial renewal date will have their certification status changed to “expired.” One “expired” certification will put all other certifications into “expired” status.  (T-0) 2.9.4.10.  AF General Officers and their civilian equivalents shall not be indexed to DoD SPēD certifications. (T-1) 2.9.4.11.  Refer  to  the  SPēD  Certification  Program  Candidate  Handbook  for  additional guidance concerning SPēD certification maintenance requirements. 2.10.

All requests must be formatted IAW AFH 33-337, The Tongue and Quill.  (T-1) 2.10.3.  The AF security CFT will evaluate and forward appeals to the appropriate office for action  and/or  review  based  on  policy  established  by  the  SPēD  Certification  Program Handbook,  DoD  3305.13-M,  DoD  Security  Accreditation  and  Certification  and  this instruction.  (T-1) 2.10.3.1.  The  Security  CFT  shall  conduct  a  comprehensive  review  of  all  waiver  and appeal requests prior to employee’s completion of Deployment/Medical Leave/Extension Form  located  within  the  My  SPēD  Certification  site.    Contact  the  AF  security  CFT  at afpc.security.cft@us.af.mil for additional guidance. (T-1) 12 AFI 36-2645  2 FEBRUARY 2017 Chapter 3 CERTIFICATION TESTING 3.1.  Base  Education  ‘testing”  and  Testing  Centers.  The  vast  majority  of  DoD  SPēD Certification  Program  assessment  delivery  will  be  conducted  through  contracted  commercial vendors.    AF  base  education  centers  will  only  be  utilized  on  a  case-by-case  basis  after coordination between the indexed employee, AF test center, AF Security CFT and DSS/CDSE. 3.1.1.
