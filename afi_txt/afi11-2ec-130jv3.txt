Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI except when  the  situation  demands  immediate  action  to  ensure  safety.    Although  this  publication provides  guidance  for  aircraft  operations  under  most  circumstances,  it  is  not  a  substitute  for sound  judgment.    When  it  is  necessary  to  protect  the  crew  and  aircraft  from  a  situation  not covered by this instruction and when immediate action is required, the Pilot in Command (PIC) has ultimate authority and responsibility for the course of action to be taken.  Report deviations, AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   13  without  waiver,  through  channels  to  HQ  AFSOC/A3  within  48  hours,  followed  by  a  written report,  if  requested.    Unless  otherwise  indicated,  HQ  AFSOC/A3  is  the  waiver  authority  for operational  procedure  requirements  contained  in  this  volume.    Request  waivers  through Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) and MAJCOM channels.  (T-2) 1.4.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. 1.4.1.1.  “Tier 0”  (T-0) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority. 1.4.1.2.  “Tier 1”  (T-1) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance may  put  airman,  mission,  or  program  strongly  at  risk,  and  may  only  be  waived  by  the MAJCOM/CC  or  delegate  with  concurrence  of  publication  approver.    When  multiple MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate. 1.4.1.2.1.  HQ AFFSA/XOF will initiate Tier 1 waivers.  Following a MAJCOM/CC (delegable no lower than MAJCOM/A3) request, HQ AFFSA/XOF will request AFI Certifying  Official  approval.    Tier  1  waiver  renewal  requests  will  only  be  accepted from MAJCOM Stan/Eval and approved by the HQ AFFSA/CC. 1.4.1.3.  “Tier  2”    (T-2)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  potentially  put the  mission  at  risk  or  potentially  degrade  the  mission  or  program,  and  may  only  be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate. 1.4.1.4.  “Tier 3”  (T-3) requirements are reserved for requirements that non-compliance has  a  remote  risk  of  mission  failure,  and  may  be  waived  by  the  Wing/CC  but  no  lower than the OG/CC. 1.4.2.  AFSOC/A3 may delegate this authority to Commander Special Operations Air Forces (COMAFSOF) for operationally assigned SOF forces during contingency operations.  If HQ AFSOC/A3 chooses to delegate waiver authority, it will be done in writing and will specify which portions of this instruction may be waived by the COMAFSOF. 1.4.2.1.

The AFSOC C2 system is based on the principles of centralized monitoring and decentralized  control  and  execution.    The  result  is  a  C2  mechanism  which  keeps  the  AFSOC Commander (CC) informed of the  current  status  of AFSOC forces while enabling the Wing or Group Commander to exercise control over day-to-day operations.  This chapter contains Tier 1 requirements in the administrative control and state active duty sections; Tier 2 requirements in general,  operational  control,  waiver  and  approval  authority,  administrative  control,  mission monitoring,  designation  of  COMASOF,    mission  commander,  pilot  in  command,  airborne mission commander, deputy mission commander, and mission clearance decision sections.  (T2) 2.2.  Operational  Control  (OPCON).  IAW  USSOCOM  Directive  10-1,  COMAFSOC exercises command authority consistent with assignment of OPCON over all active and reserve Air  Force  SOF  stationed  in  the  CONUS,  to  include  Air  National  Guard  (Training  Oversight (TOS)  only  IAW  JP  1).    OCONUS  forces  are  apportioned  OPCON  IAW  the  Global  Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG), normally to the CCDR of the theater in which they  reside.    The  CCDR  will  normally  delegate  OPCON  to  the  Theater  Special  Operations Command  (TSOC)  for  that  theater.    In  practice,  responsibility  for  planning  and  executing AFSOC missions is routinely delegated to the Wing or Group Commander.  The Wing or Group Commander,  in  turn,  exercises  control  of  non-close-hold  missions  through  the  command  post supporting the wing or group.  In the event that assigned forces undergo a Change in Operational Control (CHOP), responsibility for mission monitoring passes from the wing or group C2 facility to the gaining command.  Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent Operational Plan, Operational  Order, or deployment or execution order.  When ANG aircrews operate in a status other than Title 10, the members’ state governor, typically through delineated authorities to their appointed  Adjutant  General  (TAG),  will  control  aircrews  when  executing  Continental  United States  (CONUS)  Domestic  Operations  (DOMOP)  missions.    The  ANG  Command  Center  may serve as the reporting agency for ANG aircraft supporting ANG missions.  (T-2) 2.3.  Waiver and Approval Authorities.  (T-2) 2.3.1.  Wg/CCs or equivalent hold waiver/approval authority for items normally authorized at or below wing level when their forces are employed in: 2.3.1.1.  Deployments. 2.3.1.2.  Air Apportionment Allocation Conference taskings. 2.3.1.3.  Joint Air Apportionment Allocation Conference (JAAAC) taskings. 2.3.1.4.  Joint  Combined  Exchange  Training  (JCET)/Counter  Narcotics  Training missions. 2.3.1.5.  Other  specified  missions  as  tasked  via  the  SOF  Air  Tasking  Order  (ATO)  in SOF applications. 2.3.1.6.  CONUS  and  Outside  CONUS  (OCONUS)  forces  depart  a  TSOC/Joint  Special Operations  Air  Component  (JSOAC)  Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR)  enroute  to  United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM) AOR. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   15  2.3.1.7.  Air Reserve Component (ARC) forces (under Title 10). 2.3.1.8.  Depart  home  station  for  AFSOC-directed  contingencies/deployments/exercises (under Title 10). 2.3.2.  Operational waivers will be coordinated through Stan/Eval channels.  Waiver requests will  normally  be  the  responsibility  of  the  C2  agency  with  the  operational  control  of  the mission. 2.3.3.  Wg/CC  OPCON  terminates  when  forces  enter  a  TSOC/JSOAC  AOR  and  picks  up when forces exit a TSOC/JSOAC AOR. 2.4.  ANG Forces OPCON/Administrative Control (ADCON). 2.4.1.  OPCON (Title 10).  When 193rd SOW forces are mobilized,  AFSOC will normally exercise  command  authority  consistent  with  assignment  of  OPCON  over  those  forces  until they are transferred with a specified command relationship of OPCON (CHOPed) to another Combatant  Command.  Deploying ANG members will be assigned to  201 Mission Support Squadron,  Air  National  Guard  Readiness  Center  (ANGRC),  Andrews  AFB,  MD  for ADCON, while COMAFSOC will retain specified ADCON IAW with the Memorandum of Agreement  between  the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania,  the  National  Guard  Bureau,  and AFSOC.  COMAFSOC will transfer specified ADCON authorities to the Commander of Air Force  Forces  (COMAFFOR)  of  the  gaining  CCMD  IAW  established  Memoranda  of Agreement.  (T-1) 2.4.2.  Control  under  USC  Title  32.    The  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  (PA)  Governor controls PA ANG forces, typically through the appointed TAG, when executing missions in Title 32 status.  PA ANG Title 32 status extends to those members who are in PA Excepted State  Technician  status  and  Inactive  Duty  Status  (Rescheduled)  Unit  Training  Assemblies (UTA) or Additional Flight Training Periods (AFTP).  Authority over forces made available to  another  state  may  be  transferred  to  that  state’s  governor  IAW  agreements  between  the states.  PA ANG members operating in Title 32 status are subject to the PA Code of Military Justice (PCMJ).  Members may be gained into Title 10 status at any time. 2.5.  Mission  Monitoring.  The  AFSOC  Operations  Center  monitors  all  off-station  AFSOC aircraft  via  Theater  Battle  Management  Core  Systems  (TBMCS)  –  Execution  Status  and Monitoring (ESTAT), the Global Decision Support System (GDSS2), Theater Situation Reports, and aircrew Deployed Status Reports (DSR).  Aircraft equipped with Blue Force Tracker (BFT) devices  are  tracked  near  real  time  via  the  Common  Operating  Picture  (COP).    Inputs  to  these various tracking tools are provided by the C2 agency with OPCON.  (T-2) 2.5.1.  PIC or mission commander flight reporting duties:  (T-3) 2.5.1.1.  Stations With MAF C2 Agency.  Aircrews will provide a  “Thirty Minute” Out Call.    Transmit  a  UHF  or  VHF  arrival  advisory  to  the  destination  C2  agency approximately  30  minutes  prior  to  arrival.    Provide  Estimated  Time  in  Blocks  (ETB).  Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in  GDSS2  when  applicable.    Additionally,  aircrews  must  keep  their  controlling  C2 agency  appraised  of  all  actual  takeoff  and  landing  times,  projected  takeoff  times,  and other related information within 30 minutes after landing.  (T-3)   16  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 2.5.1.2.  Stations  Without  MAF  C2  Agency.    Transmit  mission  data  (arrival,  departure, and advisory messages) to the controlling C2 agency, within 30 minutes after landing, by any  means  available.    (Preference  in  the  following  order:    Defense  Switched  Network (DSN)/  commercial  telephone,  high  frequency  (HF)  phone  patch,  Iridium  Phone).    For critical C2 communications (i.e., aircraft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc.), voice communications are the primary method.  (T-3) 2.5.1.3.  Provide controlling C2 agency with daily DSR.

In the event of an emergency or weather related divert or reroute, the PIC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible. 2.11.1.1.  The  controlling  agency  directing  the  diversion  or  rerouting  is  responsible  for ensuring destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft and aircrew. 2.11.1.2.  The PIC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitations that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission. 2.11.2.  When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling agency will ensure the PIC is provided existing and forecasted weather for the alternate.  If the planned alternate is unsuitable upon arrival at destination, the controlling agency will advise the PIC of other suitable alternates. 2.12.  Civilian  Law  Enforcement  Support.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  Department  of  Defense  to cooperate  with  civilian  law  enforcement  officials  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable.    AFI 10801, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA), incorporates the appropriate directive and   20  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 provides uniform policies and procedures service members must follow when supporting federal, state,  and  local  civilian  law  enforcement  agencies.    It  establishes  specific  limitations  and restrictions on the use of Air Force personnel, equipment, facilities, and services by civilian law enforcement  organizations.    Report  all  requests  for  assistance  and  coordinate  all  requests  from civilian law enforcement authorities through the appropriate C2 channels. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   21  Chapter 3 AIRCREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 3.1.  Aircrew Qualification.  Each person assigned as a primary crew member must be qualified or in training for qualification in that crew position, mission and Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft.  This chapter contains Tier 2 requirements in the aircrew qualification, interfly, intrafly and alert duty sections. (T-2)  Tier 3 in the crew complement section.  (T-3) 3.1.1.  Basic  aircraft  qualification  (F  coded)  crew  members  (i.e.,  FP  and  FL)  may  perform primary  crew  duties  on  any  non-contingency  sortie  (including  unilateral  training,  joint training and exercises) when receiving mission qualification training or evaluations, and only while  under  the  supervision  of  a  qualified  instructor  or  flight  examiner  in  their  respective crew position. 3.1.2.  Basic mission capable (M coded) crew members (i.e., MP, MW, MK, and ML) may perform primary crew duties on any unilateral training mission.  For other missions, the unit commander  must  determine  the  readiness  of  each  basic  mission  capable  crew  member  to perform primary crew duties for specific mission tasking. 3.1.3.  Non-current or unqualified (U coded) pilots (i.e., UP) may perform crew duties only on designated training or evaluation missions under the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner pilot. 3.1.4.  Other  non-current  or  U-coded  crew  members  (i.e.,  UP,  UW,  UL,  and  UK)  may perform duties in their primary crew position on any sortie when under direct supervision of a  qualified  instructor  or  flight  examiner  in  their  respective  crew  position.    In  this  case,  the student  crew  member  and  the  instructor  or  flight  examiner  fulfills  the  requirement  for  one primary  position  as  specified  in  Table  3.1  with  the  exception  of  UK.    In  this  case,  one instructor or flight examiner may supervise more than one UK. 3.1.5.  Senior  staff  pilots  or  O-coded  pilots  (OP)  who  have  completed  a  Senior  Staff Familiarization course will occupy the left pilot seat only and be under direct Instructor Pilot (IP) supervision.  These individuals will log OP  for Flight  Authorization Duty Code on the Air  Force  Technical  Order  (AFTO)  Form  781,  ARMS  Aircrew/Mission  Flight  Data Document.  Refer to Paragraph 9.12 for additional restrictions. 3.1.6.  A Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) is an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) qualified crew  member.    A  WSO  may  be  qualified  as  either  an  air-land  Combat  Systems  Officer (CSO) and Mission Crew Commander (MCC) or a tactical airdrop CSO.  A CSO or WSO is required per Table 3.1.  A tactical airdrop qualified WSO or CSO is required for all airdrop and low level operations. 3.2.  EC-130J  (Super  J)  Crew  Complement.  The  EC-130J  (Super  J)  crew  complement  is specified in Table 3.1.  Unit commanders may authorize reduced crew complements as noted in the  table.    The  waiver  authority  for  any  additional  crew  complement  reductions,  down  to  the minimum  crew  complement  specified  in  the  aircraft  flight  manual,  is  the  group  commander  or COMAFSOF.  (T-3) 3.2.1.  Augmented crews are required for missions planned to take longer than a basic Flight Duty  Period  (FDP).    Augmenting  aircrew  members  must  be  current,  qualified,  and  mission   22  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 capable  IAW  AFI  11-2EC-130J,  Vol  1,  EC-130J  Aircrew  Training.    In  those  situations requiring augmentation, the crew must be augmented from the start of the duty period. 3.2.2.  With  the  exception  of  the  Combat  Mission  Sortie  (CMS),  all  events  accomplished with a reduced crew complement can be logged as long as the applicable event criteria in AFI 112EC130, Vol 1, are met.

AC:    Both  AC  must  be  qualified  in  all  phases  of  the  mission  to  be  accomplished.  Transfer of PIC duties between qualified AC will be briefed to the crew. 2.  CSO:  Either a CSO or air-land WSO will occupy the CSO crew position as noted.  A CSO  or  air-land  WSO  is  not  required  for  Functional  Check  Flight,  airlift,  or  pilot proficiency  sorties.    For  augmented  aircrew,  the  operations  group  commander  (OG/CC) (or  designated (TAC) CSO(s)/Airland WSO(s) required depending on mission profile and complexity.  (T-3) representative)  will  determine the  number  of tactical 3.  Loadmaster:  Two loadmasters are required if more than 40 passengers are scheduled to  be  carried  (except  during  unit  moves  or  contingencies).    Both  crew  members  must remain in the cargo compartment, one forward and one aft for takeoffs and landings. 4    At  squadron  commander  (Sq/CC)  discretion,  an  IL  and  student  fulfills  the  two loadmaster  requirement  to  drop  unilateral  training  heavy  equipment  loads  without Electronic Parachute Jettison System (EPJS). 5    Only  one  loadmaster  is  required  for  tactical  missions  if  any  of  the  situations  below apply: a)  Personnel or door bundle (less than 100 lbs) drops using only one paratroop door. b)  High altitude (up to  13,000 feet mean sea level (MSL)) non-static line personnel are dropped from the ramp and door or, only one paratroop door is opened. c)  CDS airdrops, including Tri-Wall Aerial Delivery System (TRIADS). d)  Dropping only Standard Airdrop Training Bundles (SATBs). e)  A no-drop (dry pass) is planned. f)  Unilateral heavy equipment training loads utilizing the EPJS. 3.3.  Additional  Crew  members  (ACM).  See  AFI  11-401,  Aviation  Management,  MAJCOM Supplement. 3.4.  Interfly.  Interfly  is  the  exchange  and/or  substitution  of  aircrew  members  and/or  aircraft between  MAJCOMs  to  accomplish  flying  missions.    Normally,  interfly  should  be  limited  to specific  operations/tests,  exercises,  or  special  circumstances.    Reference  AFI  11-401,  Aviation Management, and MAJCOM Supplement.  (T-2) 3.4.1.  HQ  AFSOC/A4RX  and  National  Guard  Bureau  (NGB)/A4MY  maintains  current Memorandum  of  Agreements  (MOA)  between  AFSOC,  AFRC,  ANG,  Air  Force  Material Command (AFMC), Air Education Training Command (AETC), and Air Combat Command (ACC) for interfly using AFSOC assigned aircraft.  Unless specified in the MOA: 3.4.1.1.  Aircraft ownership will not be transferred. 3.4.1.2.

A  flight  and  ground  mishap  reporting  responsibility  will  be  handled  IAW  AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. 3.4.2.  Waiver Authority. 3.4.2.1.  With a valid MOA IAW AFI 11-401, group commander or COMAFSOF is the approval authority for interfly on AFSOC aircraft under their control. 3.4.2.2.  No  MOA/Expired  MOA.    The  interfly  of  aircrew  members  from  different MAJCOMs or the interfly of active duty and ANG aircrews require approval from each MAJCOM/A3 and the NGB/A3, as applicable. 3.4.2.3.  Contingency  operations  must  be  approved  by  HQ  AFSOC/A3,  the  respective MAJCOM/A3, and NGB/A3. 3.4.3.  Aircrew members assigned to the USAF Weapons School (USAFWS) are authorized to participate in orientation flights in AFSOC aircraft operated by crews from 14th Weapons Squadron (WPS). 3.4.4.  Aircrew  members  assigned  to  the  USAFWS  are  authorized  to  occupy  duty  positions on  AFSOC  aircraft  operated  by  14  WPS.    Crew  members  must  be  under  instructor supervision if not current and qualified in the MDS. 3.4.4.1.  The  above  authorizations  are  extended  to  senior  leadership  in  the  USAFWS chain of command. 3.4.4.2.  Flights conducted under the above provisions will be within the normal syllabi. 3.5.  Intrafly.  Intrafly  is  the  exchange  and/or  substitution  of  aircrew  members  from  separate units  under  the  same  MAJCOM  to  accomplish  flying  missions.    Normally,  intrafly  should  be used only to relieve qualified manpower shortfalls.  (T-2) 3.5.1.  The Group Commander possessing the aircraft or COMAFSOF is approval authority for intrafly between units. 3.5.2.  As  a  minimum,  crews  will  be  qualified  in  the  MDS-aircraft  and  model,  as  well  as systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft and/or mission. 3.5.3.

EC-130J aircrews flying C130J aircraft will follow AFI 11-2EC-130J, Vol 1, Vol 2, EC-130J Evaluation Criteria and the applicable TO for the MDS. 3.6.  Orientation  Flights  and  Incentive  Flights.  Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   25  3.7.  Alert Duty.  Alert personnel are those required to be on duty for the prompt execution of a mission.    Alert  crews  will  be  readily  available  in  a  location  that  allows  the  crew  to  meet  the required  time  to  launch  from  notification.    Suitable  facilities  include  adequate  sleeping accommodations for the entire crew.  Publish flight authorizations for the alert crew to cover the entire alert tour.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules, and MAJCOM Supplement for alert procedures.  (T-2) 3.8.  Flight Duty Period and Crew Rest Restrictions.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 3, General Flight Rules, and MAJCOM Supplement. 3.8.1.  Crew  Chiefs/MEP.    The  crew  chief  is  responsible  to  the  Aircraft  Commander.    The aircraft  commander  will  determine  how  long  the  Crew  Chief  /MEP  can  safely  perform aircraft recovery actions.  The Crew Chief/MEP must have the opportunity to sleep 8 hours uninterrupted  within  each  24  hour  period,  reference  AFI  21-101,  Aircraft  and  Equipment Maintenance Management Policy for additional guidance. 3.9.  Counter-Fatigue  Management  Program.  See AFI 11-202, Vol 3,  General  Flight Rules, and MAJCOM Supplement.   26  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Chapter 4 AIRCRAFT OPERATING GUIDLELINES AND RESTRICTIONS 4.1.  Objective.  The  objective  of  the  aircraft  maintenance  team  is  to  provide  an  aircraft  for launch with all equipment operational Fully Mission Capable (FMC).  However, under specific circumstances,  some  missions  can  be  safely  operated  without  all  equipment  being  operational.  The  final  responsibility  regarding  equipment  required  for  a  mission  rests  with  the  PIC.    If  one crew accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that crew, or a different crew, to accept subsequent operations with the  same  item  or  system  inoperative.    When  the  PIC  considers  an  item  essential,  designate  the component  Mission  Essential  (ME)  on  the  AFTO  Form  781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and Work  Document,  and  the  item  will  be  repaired  or  replaced  prior  to  departure.    This  chapter contains Tier 2 requirements in sections relating to MEL, waiver protocol, landing gear system, and soft panel operations.  Tables 4.3 Communications, 4.5 Equipment, 4.6 Fire Protection, 4.7 Flight Controls, 4.11 Indicating/Recording System,  4.13 Lights, 4.14 Navigation, 4.15 Oxygen, 4.17 System Integration and Display, and 4.19 Doors contain Tier 2 requirements as well.  Tier 3 requirements are contained in the one-time flight section as well as Table 4.21 Powerplant. 4.2.  Policy.  This chapter provides guidance on how to operate with degraded equipment.  If the PIC  elects  to  operate  with  degraded  equipment  or  aircraft  system(s),  coordinate  mission requirements  (i.e.,  revised  departure  times,  fuel  requirements,  maintenance  requirements,  etc.), prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact follow-on missions. 4.3.  Minimum  Equipment  List  (MEL)  Policy.  The MEL is  a pre-launch document that lists the  minimum  equipment/systems  to  operate  the  aircraft  prior  to  takeoff.    It  is  impractical  to prepare  a  list  that  would  anticipate  all  possible  combinations  of  equipment  malfunctions  and contingent  circumstances.  Consider equipment/systems with  no listed  exceptions as  grounding items.  (T-2) 4.3.1.  The  PIC  shall  account  for  the  possibility  of  additional  failures  during  continued operation with inoperative systems or components.  The MEL is not intended for continued operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative. 4.3.2.  All  emergency  equipment  will  be  installed  unless  specifically  exempted  by  mission requirements/directives. 4.3.3.  PIC  operating  with  waiver(s)  for  degraded  equipment  shall  coordinate  mission requirements (revised departure times, fuel requirements, and maintenance requirements). 4.3.4.  If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC may deviate.  Report deviations (without waiver) to OG/CC within 48 hours, if requested. 4.4.  Waiver  Protocol.  Waivers to operate with  degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-case basis.  (T-2) 4.4.1.  MAJCOM/A3  is  the  MEL  waiver  authority  for  mission  continuation.    Initiate  the request with MAJCOM C2 agency. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   27  4.4.1.1.  While on ANG directed missions, NGB/A3 delegates MEL  waiver authority to the Unit OG/CC (or equivalent). 4.4.2.  The waiver request will include: 4.4.2.1.  Reason for the request. 4.4.2.2.  Individual crew member qualifications. 4.4.2.3.  Mission leg(s) requiring the waiver. 4.5.  Technical Assistance Service.  The PIC may request (at any time in the decision process) technical  support  and  additional  assistance  from  their  home  unit,  MAJCOM  staff,  and maintenance representatives. 4.6.  One-Time  Flights.  An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to a repair station.    Refer  to  TO  00-20-1,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance  Inspection,  Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. 4.6.1.  One-time  flight  approval  authority  is  OG/CC  or  equivalent-level  commander  with OPCON  for  MEL  listed  items.    The  193  SOW  Maintenance  Group  (MXG)/CC  (or designated official), the  senior maintenance officer, or the on-site chief of an AFMC repair team must first authorize the release.  The PIC concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.  (T-3) 4.6.1.1.  Any  One-time  flight  request  not  listed  in  the  MEL  additionally  requires MAJCOM/A3 approval.  (T-2) 4.7.  Fuel  System.  The  primary  concern  with  inoperative  fuel  boost  pumps  or  quantity indicators is fuel balance and wing loading.  Degraded operation is permissible, however, flight crews  must  consider  potentially  trapped  fuel  and  decreased  range  should  further  degradation occur.    The  MEL,  included  in  Table  4.8  along  with  the  following  paragraphs,  provides guidelines for degraded fuel system operations under most circumstances. 4.7.1.  In-flight, fuel will not be transferred into or out of a main fuel tank with an inoperative indicator or its symmetrical tank except the following: 4.7.1.1.  Fuel transfer into a main tank with an inoperative indicator may be accomplished during  contingency  or  emergency  fuel  need  situations.    All  transfers,  under  these conditions, require more than one crew member to monitor and coordinate the transfer. 4.7.1.2.  A reliable source of known quantity transferred must be available.  This source can be either the internal aircraft operating fuel quantity indicators or in-flight refueling tanker fuel on load data. 4.7.1.2.1.  Begin  crossfeed  operation  when  the  symmetrically  opposite  quantity indicator has decreased to 1,500 pounds (inboards) and 2,500 pounds (outboards). 4.7.1.3.  Engine  out  training  using  the  engine  corresponding  to  the  inoperative  indicator or its symmetrically opposite will not be conducted during tank to engine operation. 4.7.1.4.  Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow. 4.7.1.5.  Plan to land with a minimum of 6,000 pounds calculated main tank fuel.   28  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 4.7.1.6.  When  an  external  tank  indicator  is  inoperative  and  the  tank  cannot  be  visually checked empty due to foam modification, comply with the following prior to flight: 4.7.1.6.1.  Check  pressure  with  each  pump  in  the  external  tank.    If  no  pressure  is obtained, the tank is verified empty. 4.7.1.6.2.  If  pressure  is  obtained,  ground  transfer  the  fuel  from  the  external  tank.  Defuel the external tank if unable to ground transfer. 4.7.1.6.3.  When unable to verify an external tank is empty prior to engine start, place the tank on cross-feed until no pressure is obtained.  This will be completed prior to takeoff. 4.7.1.6.4.  Maintain  symmetrical  tanks  within  1,000  pounds  at  all  times.    If  small amounts (4,000 pounds or less) must be transferred, then transfer up to 1,000 pounds into  the  tank  with  the  inoperative  indicator  followed  by  an  equal  amount  into  the tank(s) with operative indicator(s).  If large amounts of fuel must be transferred, then transfer  1,000  pounds  into  the  tank  with  the  inoperative  indicator,  then  up  to  2,000 pounds  as  needed  into  the  tank(s)  with  the  operative  indicators,  then  up  to  1,000 pounds  as  needed  into  the  tank  with  the  inoperative  indicator  to  bring  all  tanks symmetrical,  or  continue  up  to  2,000  pounds  as  needed,  repeating  the  cycle  until desired fuel quantity and balance is achieved in applicable tanks. 4.8.  Landing  Gear  System.  If  a  landing  gear  system  or  position  indicator  malfunction  is encountered, only a full  stop  landing will be made.  The discrepancy  will be corrected prior to the  next  flight.    Exception:    If  repair  capability  does  not  exist  and  a  positive  determination  is made that further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be flown  to  a  destination  where  repair  capability  exists  provided  the  gear  is  not  moved  from  the down and locked position.  Required en route stops are authorized.  (T-2) 4.9.  Navigation  Systems.  Refer  to  the  navigation  systems  performance  requirements  as outlined  in  Table  4.14,  Chapter  11  of  this  instruction,  and  applicable  sections  of  the  Flight Information Planning document for the route structures and intended areas of operation. 4.10.  Soft Panel Operations. 4.10.1.  For  partial  or  complete  hard  panel  failures,  aircrews  may  revert  to  soft  panel operations.  Normally, if a soft panel is selected due to hard panel failure, it should be used for the remainder of the flight.  Doing so will mitigate the hazards associated with restoring hard  panel  functionality  for  an  item  when  the  mission  computer  commanded-state  is unknown. the  ENGINE  SHUTDOWN  and  BEFORE  LEAVING AIRPLANE checklists after the aircraft is parked will ensure the soft panel retains control of the  particular  item  throughout  shutdown.    In  all  cases,  PIC  must  consider  the  increased workload associated with using soft panels.   Accomplishing 4.10.2.  Hard panel failures may be the result of a physical failure or loss of communication with the mission computer (MC), an aircraft reboot may recover hard panel functionality.  To determine  if  hard  panel  functionality  can  be  regained,  the  following  procedures  must  be followed in sequential order: 4.10.2.1.  Completely  power  down  when  accomplishing  the  BEFORE  LEAVING AIRPLANE checklist. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   29  4.10.2.2.  Complete all checklist items in the POWER UP checklist.  Do not proceed past the  POWER  UP  checklist  until  it  can  be  determined  if  the  hard  panel  has  recovered.  Depending  on  the  system  effected  (such  as  APU,  bleed  air,  landing  gear,  etc.),  do  not apply bleed air or hydraulics until hard panel functionality can be determined. 4.10.2.3.  To  determine  if  a  hard  panel  has  recovered,  ensure  hard  panel  and  soft  panel selections/settings are identical.   Press  the Line Select  Key (LSK) to  turn the soft panel OFF.  If a Communication/Navigation/Identification (CNI) “Check (CHK) HARD PNL” or  a  referenced  hard  panel  fault  Advisory  Caution  and  Warning  System  (ACAWS) message  (i.e.,  “APU  PNL  FAULT”,  “DEF  SYS  PNL  FAULT”,  etc.)  does  not  appear, press the “VERIFY OFF LSK”.  If feasible, check hard panel functionality. 4.10.2.4.  If  a  CNI  “CHK  HARD  PNL”  or  a  referenced  hard  panel  fault  ACAWS message  appears,  the  hard  panel  has  not  recovered.    The  “CHK  HARD  PNL”  message indicates there is a mismatch between the soft panel and hard panel commands to the MC independent  of  physical  switch  positions.    Referenced  hard  panel  fault  messages  are selfexplanatory. 4.10.2.5.  If it is determined that the hard panel has not recovered, at the PIC‘s discretion, the  mission  may  continue  to  a  station  supporting  a  repair  capability,  including  en  route stops.  Do not reselect the hard panel.  If a flight must continue under the control of two or more soft panels, a waiver is required.  (T-2) 4.10.3.  After  returning  to  home  station  or  repair  facility  with  a  hard  panel  malfunction, aircrews  will  shut  down  and  turn  the  aircraft  over  to  logistics  personnel  for  required maintenance  actions.    Annotate  that  soft  panel  operation  is  selected  in  the  aircraft maintenance forms with a thorough description of the equipment failure/discrepancy.  (T-2) 4.11.  MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. 4.11.1.  Installed – Number of components or systems installed. 4.11.1.1.  In some cases, a component can be controlled from either a hard panel or from a soft panel.  Similarly, some indications can be viewed  on either a hard panel or a soft panel.    Since  switch  functions  (or  indications)  may  be  duplicated  on  each  of  the  three Communication/Navigation/Identification  Management  Unit  (CNI-MU)  displays,  the number  of  switches  (or  indications)  installed  may  not  always  be  clear.    To  clarify  this condition,  switches  (or  indications)  are  listed  as  ‘1’  in  the  installed  column  even  when they are duplicated on a soft panel. 4.11.1.2.  Although the indications on each pilot’s Heads Down Displays (HDD) can be repeated  on  more  than  one  HDD,  repetitions  of  data  in  excess  of  one  per  pilot  are  not relevant  for  flight  and  are  not  counted  in  this  MEL.    In  general,  the  flight  deck  is designed  to  provide  one  set  of  data  for  the  pilot  and  one  set  of  data  for  the  copilot  (in addition  to  the  standby  instruments).    Thus,  for  most  HDD  indications,  the  number installed is listed as ‘2’ one for each pilot. 4.11.2.  Required – The minimum number (quantity) of items required for operation provided the conditions specified in the remarks or exception column are met. 4.11.2.1.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  when  the  item  is  a  switch  (or  indication)  which  is duplicated on a soft panel, the number required for dispatch may be satisfied by either the   30  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 hard  panel  switch  (or  indication)  or  by  the  switch  (indication)  on  one  of  the  associated soft panels.  For HDD indications, the number required is ‘2’ if both pilots must have an indication, ‘1’ if only one pilot must have an indication and ‘0’ if neither pilot is required to have the indication.  For essential flight data (heading, altitude, airspeed, attitude and when required, navigation data), the pilot‘s and copilot‘s displays must have independent sources. 4.11.3.  Remarks and Exceptions.  Some technical information and procedures are contained in this column.  This is not all-inclusive; crew members shall refer to the flight manual and other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.  Note:  Common sense and good judgment  must  be  used  by  all  when  determining  minimum  equipment  requirements,  to preclude  adverse  operational  impact  or  excessive  maintenance  support  requirements.

Two  types  of equipment are of major concern: 5.7.10.1.1.  Electronic  medical  equipment  produces  Electro-magnetic  Interference (EMI)  which  is  commonly  beyond  the  limits  specified  by  Military  Standard  (STD) 461A  and  462,  and  therefore  can  interfere  with  aircraft  communication  and navigational equipment. 5.7.10.1.2.  Therapeutic  oxygen  systems  present  an  increased  hazard  of  fire  or explosion.    A  potential  hazard  is  the  inadvertent  disruption  of  the  cylinder  neck, manifold,  or  regulator  resulting  in  explosion  and  propulsion  of  the  container  or accessories. 5.7.10.2.  For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions:  (T-3) 5.7.10.2.1.  Medical  personnel  must  inform  the  PIC  when  nonstandard  electronic medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft.  (T-3) AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   89  5.7.10.2.2.  The  PIC  must  be  informed  of  the  anticipated  period  of  use  of  the equipment during the mission.  (T-3) 5.7.10.2.3.  The PIC must be alert  for any interference with aircraft communications or navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment.  (T-3) 5.7.10.2.4.  When  continuous  use  of  the  equipment  is  required  throughout  the duration  of  the  mission,  flight  must  be  restricted  to  VFR  conditions.    (T-3)  Furthermore,  exercise  additional  caution  on  night  VFR  missions  to  ensure  there  are no adverse effects on navigational equipment.  (T-3) 5.7.10.3.  For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions: 5.7.10.3.1.  All  compressed  oxygen  equipment  with  exposed,  unprotected  cylinder neck,  manifold,  or  regulator  must  be  completely  secured  from  all  movement  in  its longitudinal and lateral axis.  (T-3) 5.7.10.3.2.  Medical  personnel  must  continually  monitor  the  operation  of  the equipment to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.  (T-3) 5.7.10.4.  Mission  Impaired  Capability/Awaiting  Parts  (MICAP),  Very  Very  Important Parts  (VVIP),  sensitive  cargo,  courier  materials,  and  registered  mail  moving  within  the normal  airlift  system  are  receipted  at  the  on  and  offload  stations  using  the  air  cargo manifest.    For  unit  moves  operated  in  accordance  with  Defense  Transportation Regulation (DTR), Part III, Mobility, classified or sensitive cargo movement is normally manifested utilizing the DD Form 2130-2, Cargo Manifest or similar automated product such  as  Computer  Aided  Load  Manifesting  (CALM)  or  Automated  Air  Load  Planning System  (AALPS),  and  will  normally  be  accompanied  by  a  unit  courier.    However,  if classified/sensitive unit cargo is offered without an accompanying courier, the DD Form 1907. 5.7.10.4.1.  Defense  Courier  Service  (DCS)  couriers  coordinating  with  the  PIC  are authorized to designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crew members on military aircraft  as  couriers  to  escort  and  safeguard  courier  material  when  other  qualified personnel  are  not  available.    Qualified  passengers,  if  carried,  are  designated  before designating crew members.  The following restrictions apply: 5.7.10.4.1.1.  Primary  crew  members  will  not  be  designated  couriers  without  the consent of the PIC.  (T-3) 5.7.10.4.1.2.  Crew members on aircraft scheduled to make an extended en route stop at a location where DCS couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated as couriers.  (T-3) 5.7.10.4.2.  During  stops  at  en  route  locations  supported  by  DCS  stations,  DCS couriers are required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.  (T-3) 5.7.10.4.2.1.  During unscheduled en route stops crew members may place courier material  in  temporary  custody  of  the  following  agencies  in  descending  order  of priority. 5.7.10.4.2.1.1.

(T-2) 5.7.10.4.4.  Life  or  death  urgency  shipments  consist  of  biological  or  other  medical supplies  of  such  urgency  that  human  life  is  dependent  upon  immediate  receipt.  Shipments  will  be  manifested  separately  and  the  manifest  annotated  with  the  words LIFE  OR  DEATH  URGENCY.    All  shipments  will  be  handled  on  a  hand-to-hand receipt  basis,  using  either  the  air  cargo  manifest  or  the  DD  Form  1907,  for  unit moves.    The  PIC  will  be  briefed  on  the  urgency  of  the  shipment  and  be  made  the custodian during flight.  (T-3) 5.7.11.  Border Clearance. 5.7.11.1.  Normal Operations: 5.7.11.1.1.  Border  Clearance  Responsibility.    The  responsibility  will  be  IAW  the applicable Foreign Clearance Guide and AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo. 5.7.11.1.2.  PIC  Responsibility.    Border  clearance  is  the  responsibility  of  the  PIC, although  many  of  the  duties  have  been  assigned  to  ground  personnel  and  to  the loadmaster.  (T-3)  The PIC will ensure:  (T-3) 5.7.11.1.3.  Crew members and passengers possess current passports and valid visas, if required.  (T-3) 5.7.11.1.4.  Crew members and passengers have current shot records or certificates of immunization.  (T-3) 5.7.11.1.5.  Cargo entry documents are in proper order.  (T-3) 5.7.11.1.6.  Departure  or  arrival  to  the  US  is  through  a  port  of  entry  where  border clearance can be obtained.  (T-3) 5.7.11.1.7.  Border  clearance  for  aircraft  cargo,  passengers,  crew  and  baggage,  if required,  is  obtained  before  takeoff  to  a  foreign  area,  or  after  arrival  from  a  foreign area.  (T-3) 5.7.11.1.8.  Aircraft  spraying  is  accomplished,  if  required  (see  Paragraph  5.7.17).  (T-3) 5.7.11.1.9.  En  route  to  the  US,  the  loadmaster  has  distributed  personal  customs declarations  to  all  passengers  and  crew  members;  has  briefed  passengers  and  crew AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   91  members  on  customs  regulations;  and  has  prepared  and  compiled  necessary  border clearance forms for the PIC’s signature.  (T-3) 5.7.11.1.10.  En  route  to  the  US,  the  base  of  intended  landing  is  notified  of  any change in ETA, to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.  (T-3) 5.7.11.1.11.  A  Permit  to  Proceed  is  obtained  when  the  mission  requires  an  aircraft, which has landed in the US for customs clearance, to proceed to another US base to obtain border clearance.  The permit delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers, and  crew  until  arrival  at  the  offload  station,  saving  intermediate  offloading  and reloading normally required for  customs inspection.  The Permit  to  Proceed is  valid only to the airport of next landing, where the border clearance must be completed, or a  new  permit  obtained.    Do  not  make  intermediate  stops  unless  required  by  an emergency situation, or directed by AFSOC or NGB.  (T-3) 5.7.11.1.12.  When  an  aircraft  lands  for  a  US  border  clearance,  a  US  Customs representative normally meets the aircraft to obtain the required documents.  Do not deplane  passengers  or  crew  members,  except  a  scanner,  unless  necessary  for  safety.  (T-3)    Do  not  unload  until  approved  by  customs  and  agriculture  personnel  or  their designated representatives.  (T-3)  This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US  and  all  subsequent  landings  until  crew,  passengers,  and  cargo  complete  final border clearance. 5.7.11.2.  Exercise and Contingency Operations. 5.7.11.2.1.  General.  Certain missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit,  require  special  procedures  to  expedite  compliance  with  customs,  public  health, immigration,  and  agricultural  requirements.    A  joint  memorandum  of  understanding establishes procedures and waivers. 5.7.11.2.2.  Implementation.    Traffic  and  border  clearing  agencies  implement  all  or part of the agreement as necessary for each operation.  Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the CONUS on-load or offload base instead of the normal port of entry, or at the foreign on-load or offload base. 5.7.12.  US Customs Procedures. 5.7.12.1.  Outbound.  No requirements. 5.7.12.2.  Inbound.  Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival. 5.7.12.2.1.

Proceed  directly  from  the  aircraft  to  Customs,  Immigration,  or  Agricultural inspection for processing when required by the inspector. 5.7.14.3.  US military aircraft are sovereign territory.  When cleared to overfly or land in foreign territory, it is US policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges and  immunities  which  customarily  are  accorded  to  warships.    These  privileges  and immunities include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and  taxation,  immunity  from  search,  seizure,  and  inspections  (including  customs  and safety inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel,  equipment,  or  cargo  on  board.    The  PIC  will  not  authorize  search,  seizure, inspection  or  similar  exercises  of  jurisdiction  enumerated  above  by  foreign  authorities except  by  direction  of  HQ  USAF  or  the  American  Embassy  in  the  country  concerned.

If  requested  to  submit  to  these  actions,  the  PIC  and  crew  will deny  access  to  the  aircraft  and  seek  aid  from  the  senior  AFSOC  (or  other  USAF) representative  in  the  US  Embassy  or  Consulate  within  the  host  nation.    (T-2)  Customs  or  other  officials  will  be  informed  of  the  above  policy  and  requested  to confirm their request through their own government and with US Department of State AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   93  representatives.  If necessary, the crew will seal the aircraft, enter into crew rest, and departure intentions will be canceled until resolution of the matter by the appropriate authority.   Inform C2 authorities by the fastest available means should this situation occur.  (T3) 5.7.14.3.2.  When  confronted  with  a  search  request  by  foreign  authorities,  aircrews should consider the following procedures: 5.7.14.3.2.1.  In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement to the foreign  officials  that  the  aircraft  is  sovereign  and  not  subject  to  search  without consent  of  HQ  USAF  or  the  chief  of  mission  in  the  country  concerned.    This should  be  clearly  conveyed  in  a  polite  manner  so  as  not  to  offend  foreign authorities  that  may  honestly,  but  mistakenly,  believe  they  have  authority  to search USAF aircraft. 5.7.14.3.2.2.  If  foreign  authorities  insist  on  conducting  a  search,  the  PIC  must negotiate  to  delay  the  search  until  contact  is  made  with  HQ  USAF  or  the appropriate  embassy.    The  PIC  should  unequivocally  state  that  they  have  no authority to consent to the search and that they must relay the host nation request to these agencies for decision.  The PIC should then notify these agencies of the request  by  the  most  expeditious  means  available.    Thereafter,  the  PIC  should follow instructions provided by the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF. 5.7.14.3.2.3.  If  foreign  officials  refuse  to  desist  in  their  search  request,  the  PIC should indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so. 5.7.14.3.2.4.  If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that they protest the course of action being pursued and that they intend to notify both the appropriate American Embassy  and  HQ  USAF  of  the  foreign  action.    The  PIC  should  then  allow  the foreign  agents  onboard  the  aircraft,  without  physical  resistance,  and  thereafter report the incident to HQ USAF and appropriate embassy, as soon as possible. 5.7.14.3.3.  In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo  or  equipment.    These  instructions  and  applicable  provisions  of  classified supplements to the FCG should be followed, where applicable. 5.7.15.  Military Customs Pre-Clearance Inspection Program: 5.7.15.1.  The  military  customs  program  outlined  in  Defense  Travel  Regulation  (DTR) 4500.9-R  Part  5,  Chapter  506,  was  developed  to  assist  the  DoD  and  other  US Government agencies in the control of narcotics, contraband, and prohibited agricultural products, and to expedite entry of DoD personnel and material into the customs territory of the United States. 5.7.15.2.  Military Customs Inspectors will accomplish this inspection immediately prior to departure and may conduct more than one preclearance inspection on CONUS-bound aircraft.    When  security  considerations  necessitate  deviation  from  this  policy,  mission   94  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 planners  must  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  agency  to  ensure  the  mission  is  not jeopardized. 5.7.16.  Insect and Pest Control (Aircraft Spraying). 5.7.16.1.  The  PIC  will  ensure  required  spraying  is  accomplished  (if  applicable),  and certify the spraying on required forms.  (T-3) 5.7.16.2.  Aerosol normally is dispersed at a flow rate of 10 seconds per 1,000 cubic feet.  Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed.  Do not spray any plastic surface or allow the spray to wet it.  (T-3) 5.7.16.3.  Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other similar spaces.  (T-3) 5.7.16.4.  Spray  the  cabin,  cockpit,  and  other  spaces  accessible  from  within  the  aircraft after the crew is on board and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and ventilation openings.    (T-3)      CAUTION:    If  the  insecticide  label  directs  disembarkation  after  use, spray  prior  to  boarding  crew  or  passengers.    (T-3)    Close  all  doors  and  hatches  for  10 minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on board. 5.7.16.5.  Spray for 50 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being transited.  (T-3) 5.7.16.5.1.  When  spraying  is  required,  use  insecticide,  aerosol  d-phenothrin-2 percent,  National  Stock  Number  (NSN)  6840-01-067-6674  (or  equivalent),  to  spray the aircraft.  Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying.  (T-3) 5.7.16.6.  When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the aircraft in-flight, notify the destination  CCC,  base  operations,  or  airport  manager  of  the  situation  before  landing  so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.  (T-3) 5.7.16.7.  Upon  arrival,  do  not  open  cargo  doors  or  hatches  except  to  enplane  officials inspecting the aircraft for insect or rodent infestation.  Do not on-load or offload until the inspection  is  satisfactorily  completed.    (T-3)    This  procedure  may  be  altered  to  satisfy mission or local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager. 5.7.17.  Ordnance  Procedures.    Conduct  the  following  procedures  after  the  live  firing  of chaff/flares or the crew suspects aircraft battle damage:  (T-3) 5.7.17.1.  After landing, taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location to check for hung ordnance.  (T-3) 5.7.17.2.  The loadmaster or another qualified crew member will de-plane the aircraft and check all chaff/flare dispensers for hung ordnance or damage.  (T-3)  Note:  ALE-47 flare squibs that fail to fire are not considered hung ordnance. 5.7.17.3.  If hung ordnance is  found, identified by  a protruding or partially  ejected  flare cartridge,  the  aircraft  will  remain  in  a  de-arm  area  until  Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal (EOD) personnel meet the aircraft.  (T-3)  The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area until EOD personnel can clear all hung ordnance.  (T-3) 5.7.17.4.  If hung ordnance is not found, the aircraft can proceed to the parking location. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   95  5.7.18.  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Programs.    BASH  programs  are centralized  unit  efforts  that  provide  information  cross-feed,  hazard  identification,  and  a consolidated  course  of  action.    As  a  minimum,  unit  commanders  must  implement  the following procedures:  (T-3) 5.7.18.1.  Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.  (T-3) 5.7.18.1.1.  Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.  (T-3) 5.7.18.1.2.  Bird  Watch  Condition  Moderate  -  Initial  takeoffs  and  final  landings allowed only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity.  (T-3)  Local IFR/VFR traffic pattern activity is prohibited. 5.7.18.1.3.  Bird Watch  Condition  Severe  - All  takeoffs  and landings are prohibited.  Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent.  (T-3)  Parent MAJCOM/A3 waiver is  required  to  operate  at  airfields  not  controlled  by  the  Mobility  Air  Forces  (MAF).  (T-2) 5.7.18.2.  Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of migratory bird activity.   Schedulers shall make every effort  to  not schedule takeoffs, landings, and low-levels from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the Phase II period.  (T-3)  Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR Supplement along with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions. 5.7.18.3.  When  operating  at  airfields  where  no  BASH  program  exists,  a  PIC  has  the authority to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2 authority. 5.7.18.4.  Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike.  (T-3)  The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM)  on  HQ  AFSC/SEF  website  contains  BASH  information  including  regionalized CONUS  bird  migration  patterns,  Portable  Flight  Planning  System  (PFPS)  software overlay,  and  the  latest  news.    The  Avian  Hazard  Advisory  System  (AHAS)  website  is another source for real time bird hazard information.  See AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, for additional information. 5.7.18.5.  Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit, or as practicable, to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel.  Bird strike damage  cannot  be  accurately  assessed  in-flight,  and  undetected  damage  may  result  in  a complex airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can make reliable damage assessments. 5.7.19.  Functional Check Flights and Acceptance Check Flights (ACF).  FCF and ACF will be accomplished IAW TO 1-1-300, Functional Check Flights and Maintenance Operational Checks,  TO  1C-130J-6CF-1,  Acceptance  or  Functional  Check  Flight  Procedures,  and  AFI 21101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management.  Crews should only perform tasks or functions  contained in  specific technical  order  guidance.    If requested to  perform  a non-standard function, PICs should contact their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies. 5.7.19.1.  FCF Restrictions.  See TO 1-1-300 and AFI 21-101.   96  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 5.7.19.1.1.  The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program.  Publish additional guidance in local supplement to this instruction.  (T-3)  The OG/CC may authorize a partial FCF to  check only  those systems  disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or modification. 5.7.19.1.2.  Conduct  check  flights  within  the  designated  check  flight  airspace  of  the base  from  which  the  flight  was  launched  except  when  the  flight  must  be  conducted under specific conditions, not compatible with local conditions  and area restrictions.  (T-3) 5.7.19.1.3.  The  decision  to  approve  a  combined  FCF  and  ferry  flight  is  the responsibility of the HQ AFSOC/A3.  (T-2) 5.7.19.1.4.  The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF crew members.    (T-3)    The  OG/CC,  or  deployed  equivalent,  may  authorize  temporary waivers to FCF aircrew qualification when operationally necessary.  The OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM assessment for that specific FCF flight.  (T-3) 5.7.19.1.5.  Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC.  Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) may authorize a flight  under a combination of VMC and  IMC.  Begin  the flight  in  VMC.    If the aircraft and  all systems  are operating properly, the crew may proceed IFR through IMC to VFR on Top for the altitude phase of the flight.  (T-3) 5.7.19.1.6.  If  a  malfunction  occurs  during  a  FCF,  the  Maintenance  Group Commander (MXG/CC) may subsequently release the aircraft for flight providing the malfunction  is  not  related  to  the  condition  generating  the  FCF,  and  the  original condition operationally checked normal.  (T-3) 5.7.19.1.7.  Only  FCF  crews  shall  perform  high-speed  taxi  checks.    Perform  checks IAW  the  flight  manual  and  maintenance  technical  orders.    Prepare  the  aircraft  with minimum fuel necessary to accomplish the check to limit brake/tire wear, (ensure fuel on  board  will  permit  a  safe  return  to  base  should  the  aircraft  unexpectedly  become airborne) and turn on the anti-skid system.  The PIC will calculate takeoff data for the highest  speed  planned  and  ensure  runway  available  allows  sufficient  stopping distance for existing conditions without exceeding normal brake energy limits.  (T-2) AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   97  Chapter 6 AIRLAND OPERATIONS 6.1.  Aircraft  Maximum  Gross  Weight  Policy.  Normally  the  aircraft  gross  weight  will  not exceed 164,000 pounds for all EC-130J.  Waiver authority for operations above those specified and up to 175,000 pounds is the MAJCOM/A3.  (T-2)  Reference Chapter 9 for additional gross weight limitations associated with aircrew training. 6.2.  Checklists.  Aircrews  must  be  familiar  with  notes,  warnings,  and  cautions  without  direct reference to TO.  (T-3) 6.2.1.  The  only  pages  (or  inserts)  authorized  in  checklist  binders  are  C-130  series  TO aircrew  checklists,  AFSOC  approved  checklists,  briefing  guides,  and  unit  approved information  guides.  Units  may  construct  locally  approved  in-flight  guides  using  AF  Form 4124, Flight Crew Information Guide. 6.2.2.  Any personal notes on checklists, briefings, or information guides must be current and written in pencil.  (T-3) 6.3.  Duty  Station.  One  of  the  pilots  may  be  out  of  their  seat  for  brief  periods  to  meet physiological needs.  (T-3)  With both pilots in their seats, the PIC may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station in accordance with Controlled Cockpit Rest guidance in AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  All other crew positions are authorized rest periods with approval from the  PIC  and  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3.    Only  one  pilot  may  be  absent  from  their duty station at a time.  (T-3)  All aircrew members will notify the PIC prior to departing assigned primary duty station.  (T-3) 6.4.  Flight  Deck  Entry.  PICs  may  authorize  passengers  and  observers  access  to  the  flight station  during  takeoff,  climb,  en-route,  air  refueling,  descent,  and  landing  only  if  seats  with seatbelts are available.  Passengers and observers will not be permitted access to the flight deck crew  positions  regardless  of  availability    (T-3)    During  takeoff  and  landing,  observers  will  be seated  in  a  seat  approved  for  use  during  takeoff  and  landing  with  appropriate  safety  belts  and shoulder harnesses fastened.  (T-3)  In all cases, sufficient oxygen sources must be available to meet the requirements of AFI 11-202, Vol 3, applicable supplement. 6.5.  Takeoff and Landing Policy. 6.5.1.  The  PIC  will  occupy  the  left  seat  for  all  takeoffs  and  landings.    (T-3)    A  certified Instructor Pilot may act as PIC from either seat. 6.5.2.  The left seat pilot will land during aircraft emergencies.  (T-3)  A certified Instructor Pilot may takeoff or land from either seat under any condition. 6.5.3.  A MP or FP may take off and land from either seat. 6.5.4.  A MP will takeoff/land from the left seat under the following conditions:  (T-3) 6.5.4.1.  During maximum effort or substandard airfield operations.  (T-3) 6.5.4.2.  Pilots in “Instructor Pilot” upgrade training may take off and land from the right seat  under  the  supervision  of  an  Instructor  Pilot  during  maximum  effort  or  substandard airfield operations.  (T-3)   98  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 6.5.4.3.  During  missions  operating  in  areas  of  hostile  activity.    For  units  operating  in defined combat zones, OG/CC or deployed Mission Commander may authorize landings from the right seat at specific airfields.  (T-3) 6.5.4.4.  At airfields  that require any waiver approval.    Exception:  Non-DoD approach waivers.  (T-3) 6.5.4.5.  At  certification  airfields  specified  in  the  HQ  Air  Mobility  Command  Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) via GDSS.  (T-3) 6.5.4.6.  PICs  who  possess  less  than  100  hours  in  command  in  the  C-130  aircraft  since initial  upgrade will make all takeoffs and landings when the right  seat  is occupied by  a Copilot (CP) or FP under any of the following conditions  (T-2): 6.5.4.6.1.  Ceiling/visibility less than 300 feet and/or RVR 40 (3/4 sm visibility).  (T-2) 6.5.4.6.2.  RCR less than 12.  (T-2) 6.5.4.6.3.  Crosswind component greater than 15 knots.  (T-2) 6.5.4.7.  Pilots may takeoff and land utilizing NVD without a CSO on board the aircraft provided they are not required for mission events. 6.6.  Copilot  Landing  Policy.  Except as specified in Paragraph 6.5, and provided no patients or DV4 or higher are on board, copilots may takeoff or land: 6.6.1.  From either seat if an instructor pilot or evaluator pilot occupies the other seat. 6.6.2.  Current  and  qualified  co-pilots  may  accomplish  NVG  takeoffs  and  landings  (non-maximum effort) from the right seat provided the pilot occupying the left seat is current and qualified for NVG takeoffs and landings. 6.7.  Landing Gear and Flap Operation. 6.7.1.  The  PM  will  operate  the  landing  gear,  landing,  and  taxi  lights.    (T-3)    Actuate  the landing gear only after the command of the PF  (T-3)  Prior to actuation of the landing gear, the PM will acknowledge the command by repeating it.  (T-3) 6.7.2.  PM operate the flaps only after the command of the PF  (T-3)  Prior to operating the flaps, acknowledge the PF command by repeating it.  (T-3) 6.8.  Use  of  Outside  Observers.  Available  crew  members  will  assist  in  clearing  during  taxi operations, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL as crew duties permit.  (T-3) 6.9.  Seat  Belts.  Crew  members  occupying  the  Pilot  (P)  and  CP  positions  will  have  seat  belts fastened  from  engine  start  through  shutdown,  except  as  outlined  in  Paragraph  6.3  and  the following:  (T-3) 6.9.1.  All  occupants  will  be  seated  with  their  seat  belts  fastened  during  taxi,  takeoff,  and landing  unless  crew  duties  dictate  otherwise.    Exception:    Evaluators,  instructors,  mission commanders,  crew  members  performing  scanner  duties,  outside  observers  during  taxi, loadmasters  and  medical  personnel  performing  required  duties;  however,  those  individuals will  have  a  designated  seat  (spot  for  combat  loading  procedures)  and  required  restraint available.  (T-3) AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   99  6.9.2.  Provide a safety belt for all occupants over 2 years of age.  Occupants will fasten seat belts securely when turbulence is encountered or anticipated, or in areas of forecast clear air turbulence.  (T-3) 6.9.3.  Floor  loading  is  authorized  to  support  dedicated  unconventional  forces  and  foreign counterparts  during  operations,  exercises,  and  training.    This  procedure  will  not  be  used  in lieu  of  providing  normal  seating  when  available.    Exception:    Group  commander (COMAFSOF  for  contingency  operations)  may  authorize  Rapid  Infil/Exfil  procedures  and floor loading with non-SOF personnel.  (T-3) 6.9.4.  While  performing  scanner  duties,  loadmasters  or  authorized  scanners,  may  use  the paratroop  door  seats  (non-crashworthy)  during  combat,  contingency  missions,  or  while participating in training missions.  Loadmasters or authorized scanners using paratroop door seats  (non-crashworthy)  will  restrain  themselves  by  use  of  the  riggers  belt  and  retention lanyard and will have an assigned seat. 6.10.  Aircraft  Lighting.  For  non-tactical  operations  refer  to  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  and  AFSOC supplement.  Use landing lights at night in unlighted areas.  Use taxi lights in-flight any time the landing gear is extended unless reflections cause pilot distractions. 6.10.1.  NVG  Lighting.    Follow  the  exterior  lighting  guidance  outlined  in  AFTTP 33.E/MC130J  for  all  NVG  training  situations.    Lights-out  (or  Covert  Lighting)  operations during peacetime will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3 and AFSOC supplement. 6.10.2.  Cargo  compartment  lighting  will  be  dictated  by  the  tactical  situation  and  will  be coordinated  between  the  mission  commander/PIC  and  loadmaster(s).    (T-3)    Cargo compartment  emergencies  may  require  overt  lighting  on  full  bright.    The  nature  of  the emergency and the tactical situation will dictate what level of lighting is  used, and whether the loadmaster continues the use of NVGs. 6.11.  Portable Electronic Devices.  Refer to AFI 11-202, Vol 3, and MAJCOM Supp.  A listing of AFSOC approved portable electronic devices is maintained by HQ AFSOC/A3V. 6.12.  Advisory Calls.  The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight director and autopilot mode selections, and mode transitions, (e.g., “Autopilot engaged”, “Altitude Hold”, “Autothrottles”, “Nav-Capture”, etc.) and/or when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures.  (T-3)  The PM will make all advisory calls except those designated for other crew members.  (T-3)  Mandatory advisory calls are as follows.  (T-3) Table 6.1.  Takeoff. PHASE OF FLIGHT Takeoff – prior to Refusal Speed At Refusal Speed  At Rotation Speed PF    PM “Reject” 1 “Go” 2 “Rotate” Note 1.  Prior to Refusal Speed, any crew member noting a safety of flight condition/malfunction will state “Reject” and give a brief description of the malfunction.   100  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Note 2.  If refusal speed equals takeoff speed, “Go” is not required. Table 6.2.  Climb Out and Descent.

With weather at CAT 1 minimums on a CAT 1 ILS, the pilot may only see the initial portion of the Approach Lighting System (ALS).  The pilot may continue to 100 HAT but may AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   101  not descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the ALS as a reference unless the red termination bars or the red side row bars are also visible and identifiable. 6.12.1.  Deviations: 6.12.1.1.  The PM will inform the PF when heading or airspeed deviations are observed, or when altitude is more than 100 feet from the desired and no attempt is being made to correct the deviation.  (T-3) 6.12.1.2.  Any  crew  member  seeing  a  deviation  of  200  feet  altitude  or  10  knots  in airspeed,  or  a  potential  terrain  or  obstruction  problem,  will  immediately  notify  the  PF.  (T-3)  Deviations from prescribed procedures will also be announced.  (T-3) 6.13.  Stabilized  Approach  Philosophy.  Unstable  approaches  are  primary  contributors  to numerous  military  and  civilian  mishaps.    Stabilized  approaches  are  essential  for  the  safe operation  of  aircraft  and  are  mandatory.    This  criteria  defines  specific  parameters  that  mitigate the risk during this critical phase of flight.  This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate corrective actions to stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters. 6.13.1.  The following criteria apply to all non-tactical approaches:  (T-3) 6.13.1.1.  At FAF/glide slope (GS) intercept (IMC): 6.13.1.1.1.  Airspeed  is  -10/+20  knots  of  computed  approach  speed  for  aircraft configuration. 6.13.1.1.2.  Aircraft is in a landing configuration. 6.13.1.1.3.  Sink rate is no greater than 1500 feet per minute (FPM). 6.13.1.1.4.  All briefings and checklists are complete. 6.13.1.1.5.  If these criteria are not met by FAF/GS (IMC), the PM will announce the deviation. 6.13.1.2.  At minimums (IMC)/1 mile final (VMC): 6.13.1.2.1.  Airspeed  is  -10/+10  knots  of  computed  approach  speed  for  aircraft configuration. 6.13.1.2.2.  Aircraft is in a landing configuration. 6.13.1.2.3.  Sink rate is no greater 1,000 FPM. 6.13.1.2.4.  If these criteria are not met by minimums (IMC)/1 mile final (VMC) for all non-tactical approaches, the PM will announce "Go-Around."  (T-3)  The PF will execute a missed approach.  (T-3)  Note:  Tactical approaches/VFR patterns the PF is required to brief the maneuver parameters prior to execution.  (T-3) 6.14.  Wind  Limitations.  Maximum  crosswind  limits  are  in  accordance  with  aircraft  TO limitations.  Remain within the “Recommended” or “Caution” areas of the crosswind charts for normal takeoffs and landings.  All maximum effort operations and simulated engine out landings must  fall  within  the  “Recommended”  area  unless  otherwise  approved  by  the  Group Commander/COMAFSOF (for contingency operations).  (T-3)   102  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 6.15.  Runway  Condition  Reading  (RCR)  and  Runway  Surface  Condition  (RSC).  The performance  charts  used  to  determine  braking  action  are  based  on  concrete  runways.    The runway  surface  should  be  considered  wet  when  water  on  the  runway  causes  a  reflective  glare.  The  RCR  values  for  the  following  runway  surfaces  in  Table  6.5  are  estimates  based  on operational experience and should be used only as a guide. Table 6.5.  RCR Values for other than Concrete Surfaces.

Limit  EC-130J  operations  into  and  out  of  slush  or  water  covered  runways  to  a covering of one inch.  (T-3)  This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10  is  equal  to  one  inch  of  slush  or  water.    Performance  data  where  more  than  one  inch  of slush or water is present may not be accurate. 6.16.  Wake  Turbulence  Avoidance.  Adhere  to  aircraft  wake  turbulence  avoidance  and separation criteria contained in DoD FLIP planning (General Planning Chapter 5). 6.17.  Landing  Zone  (LZ)  Markings.  LZ  markings  may  vary  depending  upon  the  supporting agency  (refer  to  AFI  13-217,  Drop  Zone  and  Landing  Zone  Operations).    The  markings  to  be used  must  be  firmly  established  during  mission  planning  and  included  in  the  aircrew  briefing.  (T-3) 6.18.  Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting Requirements (ARFF).  ARFF requirements at nonUSAF active flying bases are as follows: 6.18.1.  Up to four takeoffs and landings within 7 consecutive days may be accomplished at a LZ or airfield without ARFF.  This is an airfield restriction.  Each Unit should track totals at airfields under their control.   If totals  are not  tracked at  airfields owned/controlled by other agencies, Wing/Group current operations will track to ensure the restriction is not exceeded for assigned aircraft.  (T-3) 6.18.2.  For more frequent operations at an LZ or airfield, refer to AFPAM 32-2004, Aircraft Fire  Protection  for  Exercises  and  Contingency  Response  Operations,  to  calculate  ARFF requirements.    Note:    Non-USAF  ARFF  vehicles  may  be  used  if  the  agent  and  pumping capabilities are equivalent. 6.18.3.  Waivers  to  the  ARFF  requirements  will  be  considered  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Required information for waiver request can be found in AFPAM 32-2004.  (T-2) 6.19.  Crew Resource Management (CRM). 6.19.1.  “Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crew members.  The use of "Time Out" will: 6.19.1.1.  Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   103  6.19.1.2.  Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs. 6.19.1.3.  Notify  all  crew  members  when  someone  sees  the  aircraft  or  crew  departing from  established  guidelines, is  simply uncomfortable with the developing conditions. the  briefed  scenario,  or that  someone 6.19.2.  As  soon  as  possible  after  a  "Time  Out"  has  been  called,  the  aircrew  will  take  the following actions:  (T-3) 6.19.2.1.  Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft and ensure terrain clearance.  (T-3) 6.19.2.2.  The initiating crew member will voice their concerns to the crew.  (T-3) 6.19.2.3.  The  PIC  will  provide  all  other  crew  members  with  the  opportunity  to  voice inputs relative to the stated concerns.  (T-3) 6.19.2.4.  After  considering  all  inputs,  the  PIC  will  direct  the  aircrew  to  continue  the current course of action or direct a new course of action.  (T-3) 6.19.3.  Fuel  Panel.   The fuel  panel  is  considered a “verification panel”.  The PM/LM/CSO should advise the PF before operating the panel (i.e., priming, cross-feeding, tank-to-engine, transferring, non-standard configurations, and dumping)  After completing the task, the PM should verify the panel is set correctly.  To facilitate this coordination, pilots should plan to make  changes  to  the  fuel  panel  during  periods  of  low  workload  such  as  before  taxi  and during cruise segments. 6.19.4.  Critical Action Coordination. 6.19.4.1.  Flight  critical/irreversible  actions  should  always  be  confirmed  by  two  crew members.    These  actions  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  pulling  the  engine  fire  handle, placing  the  engine  start  switch  to  stop,  moving  a  propeller  control  switch  to  feather, discharging agent, and dumping fuel.  The crew member performing the action points to the affected switch/handle and verbally seeks confirmation from a second crew member (i.e., “CONFIRM NUMBER  ONE”).  The crew  member confirming the  action looks at the affected switch/handle and acknowledges (i.e.,  “NUMBER ONE CONFIRMED”). 6.19.4.2.  Once the fire handle is pulled, the ACAWS messages indicating the shutdown condition/situation  may  disappear.    Verifying  and  verbally  confirming  associated  ACAWS  messages  prior  to  engine  shutdown  will  assist  the  aircrew  to  determine  if  the engine can be restarted if a greater emergency arises. 6.20.  Automation.  Aircraft  automation  will  not  command  crew  actions.    The  automated systems will recommend/perform actions and the crew will determine/verify the proper course of action. 6.20.1.  The PF will determine the most desirable level  of  automation for  a  given situation.  (T3) 6.20.2.  If the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS)/Flight Director provides unexpected commands to the flight controls, the PF will revert to lower levels of automation or manual flight as necessary before attempting to resolve system problems.  (T-3) 6.20.3.  Crews will follow the guidance below, except for cruise flight (above 10,000 ft):  (T-3)   104  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 6.20.3.1.  The PF will fly the aircraft and maintain a dedicated head-up lookout.  If the PF intends to be head-down, aircraft control shall be transferred to the PM, who will remain head-up.  (T-3) 6.20.3.2.  Any crew member that observes both  pilots head-down at the same time shall alert the PF without delay.  (T-3) 6.20.3.3.  If  the  PM  must  divert  attention  away  from  normal  clearing  and  monitoring duties  for  an  extended  period  of  time,  the  PM  will  state  “Head-Down”.    (T-3)    The  PF will  verbally  acknowledge  this  call.    (T-3)    The  PM  will  verbalize  “Head-Up”  after completion of duties.  (T3)  The PF will then update the PM on current status as required.  (T-3) 6.20.4.  A closed loop system of entering data and verifying the correct data is entered before allowing the aircraft automation to perform a function is critically important.  Regardless of who initiates the action, the other pilot/CSO must verify the data and both pilots will monitor the aircraft for the appropriate response.  (T-3) 6.20.4.1.  Table  6  6  and  Table  6.7  provide  standard  actions  for  both  pilots  during Automated and Manual flight. 6.20.4.2.  Automated  flight  is  defined  as  the  autopilot  fully  engaged  and  coupled  to  the flight  director.    Use  auto-throttles  as  desired.      CAUTION:    If  the  auto-throttles  are disengaged  for  sustained  descents  during  automatic  flight,  it  is  possible  that  Altitude Capture may occur with the power levers at or near Flight Idle and result in an approach to stall condition. 6.20.4.3.  Manual Flight is defined as the PF providing manual input to the flight controls or autopilot.  Use auto-throttles as desired. Table 6.6.  Automated Flight.

CSO will be primary for this function if on board. 6.21.  Ground  Collision  Avoidance  System  (GCAS)  /  Terrain  Awareness  and  Warning System (TAWS). 6.21.1.  When a GCAS TERRAIN or TAWS TERRAIN / OBSTACLE AHEAD alert occurs and terrain/obstacle clearance cannot be assured visually, immediately change the flight path   106  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 (within 3 to 5 seconds) by initiating a takeoff power climb.  (T-3)  Continue the climb until a safe altitude is reached or until exiting the alert envelope.  (T-3)  With terrain and obstacles clearly in sight, the PF will call terrain/obstacle in sight, state intentions and visually remain clear of terrain/obstacles.  (T-3)  If the situation degrades and a GCAS PULL UP or TAWS TERRAIN  /  OBSTACLE  PULL  UP  alert  occurs,  immediately  execute  the  Wind Shear/GCAS/TAWS alert recovery in the flight manual.   WARNING:  Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the low-altitude warning. 6.21.2.  In  TACTICAL  mode,  several  GCAS  alert  envelopes  are  modified  to  allow  for maneuvering in close proximity to terrain.  Normally, this mode is most suitable for modified contour flight and VFR low-altitude arrivals but, at the AC‘s discretion, may be used for any tactical operation. 6.22.  Radar Altimeter. 6.22.1.  Instrument Approaches. 6.22.1.1.  Precision Approaches. 6.22.1.1.1.  Set RAD ALT reference to HAT minus 50 feet.  (T-3) 6.22.1.1.2.  CAT II ILS.  Set published Radar Altimeter minimums.  (T-3) 6.22.1.2.  Non-Precision  Approaches.    Setting  the  RAD  ALT  as  prescribed  below  is meant  to  adequately  alert  the  crew  to  an  unsafe  terrain  clearance  condition  (Altitude-Altitude)  in  the  absence  of  a  Minimums-Minimums  alert.    Setting  the  RAD  ALT  to  a higher  setting  than  prescribed  may  result  in  premature/unexpected  Altitude-Altitude advisories and prevent the GCAS Minimums alert. 6.22.1.2.1.  Straight-In  Approaches.    Normally  set  RAD  ALT  reference  to  250  feet (minimum setting). 6.22.1.2.2.  Circling  Approaches.    Normally  set  RAD  ALT  reference  to  300  feet (minimum setting). 6.22.1.3.  When  established  on  a  published  approach  in  IMC,  or  at  night  when  terrain clearance  cannot  be  assured,  and  an  Altitude-Altitude  special  alert  is  heard,  initiate  an immediate  Go-Around.    (T-3)    Once  terrain  clearance  is  confirmed,  resume  normal operations.    In  day  VMC,  the  aircrew  will  evaluate  the  alert  and  determine  the appropriate course of action (continue the approach or go-around).  (T-3) 6.23.  Runway  and  Taxiway  Requirements.  Use  normal  takeoff  and  landing  procedures whenever  practical.    (T-3)    Normally,  takeoffs  will  be  initiated  from  the  beginning  of  the approved usable portion of the runway.   Intersection  takeoffs may be made at  the discretion of the  PIC  provided  the  operating  environment  (i.e.,  gross  weight,  obstructions,  climb  criteria, weather, etc.) allows for a safe takeoff and departure.  Do not use runways less than 3,000 feet during peace-time Normal and Max Effort Operations.  (T-3)  Minimum runway width is 80 feet (60  feet  for  max  effort).    Minimum  taxiway  width  is  30  feet.    The  MAJCOM/A3  may  waive runway length & taxiway/runway width requirements.  (T-2)  CNI TOLD computations must be based on the runway remaining.  (T-3)  For mission accomplishment, if approach end overruns are available and stressed or authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   107  6.23.1.  Use of wheel brakes:  Any time wheel brakes are used on landing rollout greater than that  defined  in  the  Dash  1  as  a  “partial  brake  landing”,  the  PIC  will  ensure  the  BRAKE COOLING CHARTS  (Dash 1-1) time constraints are  complied with.   (T-3)  Brake  cooling times  may  be  disregarded  if  the  runway  available  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  Critical  Field Length (CFL)/  Adjusted  Minimum  Field  Length  Maximum  Effort  Take  Off (AMFLMETO)/Minimum  Field  Length  Maximum  Effort  Take  Off  (MFLMETO)  using  an RCR of 2.  For operational missions, the squadron/mission commander may waive both the brake cooling times and CFL/AMFLMETO/MFLMETO.  (T-3) 6.23.2.  Normal Operations: 6.23.2.1.  Takeoff.  Minimum runway length is critical field length. 6.23.2.2.  Normal  takeoffs  shall  not  be  made  when  refusal  speed  is  less  than  ground minimum control speed (Vmcg).  In this condition the PIC will either:  (T-3) 6.23.2.2.1.  Download cargo or fuel.  (T-3) 6.23.2.2.2.  Wait until weather conditions improve.  (T-3) 6.23.2.2.3.  Use maximum effort procedures.  (T-3) 6.23.2.3.  Three-Engine Takeoffs.  An actual engine-out takeoff requires HQ AFSOC/A3 (COMAFSOF for contingency operations) waiver.  (T-2) 6.23.2.4.  The  minimum  runway  required  for  normal  landings  is  the  charted  landing distance  over  50  foot  obstacle  with  outboard  engines  in  high  speed  ground  idle  and inboard engines in max reverse (2 OB HGI; 2 IB REV in the Performance Manual), and maximum anti-skid braking. 6.23.2.4.1.  If  runway  length  available  for  landing  is  less  than  required  by  the previous criteria,  crews may use landing  ground roll plus  1,500 feet  when approved by the squadron commander.  In this case, ensure the landing touchdown is in the first 500 feet of the runway. 6.23.2.5.  Touch  and  Go  landings.    Minimum  runway  length  is  listed  in  Table  6.8  for touch and go landings. 6.23.3.  Short Field Operations. 6.23.3.1.  Use Maximum Effort  procedures when conditions  (runway dimensions and/or obstacles)  or  directives  require  their  use.    Runway  widths  less  than  80  feet  require  a maximum  effort  qualified crew (i.e., 10,000 foot runway that  is  65 feet  wide requires a maximum  effort  qualified  crew).    All  maximum  effort  operations  must  fall  in  the “Recommended”  area  of  the  wind  limitations  charts  unless  otherwise  approved  by  the Squadron Commander.  (T-3) 6.23.3.2.  Use  of  non-hard  surfaced  runways  or  taxiways  requires  Group  Commander (COMAFSOF for contingency operations) approval.  Note:  Make an AFTO 781A entry when landings to non-hard surfaced runways are accomplished.  (T-3) 6.23.3.3.  Maximum Effort Takeoff.  Max effort qualified Aircraft Commanders will use maximum effort takeoff procedures if available runway length is less than CFL.   108  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 6.23.3.4.  Runway  length.   Max  effort  qualified  Aircraft  Commanders  may  use MFLMETO  with  Squadron  Commander  or  COMAFSOF  approval  if  mission  necessity dictates.    Aircrew  will  use  AMFLMETO  when  runway  length  is  available.    (T-3)    WARNING:  Aircraft performance and obstacle clearance is predicated on obtaining and then  maintaining  max  effort  obstacle  clearance  speed  as  quickly  as  possible.    Aircraft performance  below  obstacle  clearance  speed  may  not  allow  safe  clearance  of  obstacles.  Note:  When obstacles are a factor, use actual Maximum Effort Rotation Speed (VRmax) and  climb  out  at  Maximum  Effort  Obstacle  Clearance  speed.    (T-3)    MAX  EFF  Max Gross  weight  displayed  on  Takeoff  Page  3/4  (Wedge  Obstacles)  &  Takeoff  Page  4/4 (Point  Obstacles)  are  only  valid  for  the  Max  Effort  Predicted  Climb-Out  flight  profile.  Because  the  Performance  Manual  does  not  contain  an  Adjusted  Max  Effort  Climb-Out profile,  aircrews  cannot  evaluate  the  obstacle  clearance  data  (i.e.,  Maximum  Adjusted Max  Effort  Takeoff  Gross  Weights  limited  by  a  Gradient  or  an  Obstacle).    Note:  Simulated obstacle clearance height will not exceed 50 feet.  (T-3) 6.23.3.5.  Acceleration Check Time.  An acceleration check time is required when refusal speed  is  less  than  rotation  speed.    (T-3)    An  Acceleration  Time  Check  should  also  be computed when, in the opinion of the AC, a critical condition exists (heavy gross weight (GW), high pressure altitude (PA), obstacles, RSC, etc.). 6.23.3.6.  Minimum rotation speed is Adjusted Maximum Effort Rotation Speed (VRmax).  Exception:    Squadron  Commander  or  COMAFSOF  may  approve  the  use  of  VRmax  if mission necessity dictates.  (T-3) 6.23.4.  Maximum  Effort  Landing:    Use  maximum  effort  landing  procedures  whenever  the runway  available  for  landing  is  less  than  that  required  for  a  normal  landing.    Plan  the touchdown within the first 500 feet of usable runway.  (T-3) 6.23.4.1.  Minimum  runway  length  for  maximum  effort  landing  is  maximum  effort landing  ground roll plus  500 feet.    If the zone is unmarked, minimum  runway length  is maximum  effort  ground  roll  plus  1,000  feet.    Group  Commanders  (COMAFSOF  for contingency operations) may approve unmarked 500 foot zones.  (T-3) 6.23.4.1.1.  Always  compute  landing  performance  with  2  engines  in  reverse,  2 engines   Group  Commanders (COMAFSOF  for  contingency  operations)  may  approve  the  use  of  all  4  in  reverse.

MAJCOM/A3 may waive runway length/width and taxiway width requirements.  (T-2)   2.  Use maximum effort takeoff procedures if available runway length is less than CFL. 3.    Minimum  runway  length  for  maximum  effort  operations  is  the  ADJUSTED  MFLMETO.  Squadron  Commander  may  approve  the  use  of  MFLMETO  not  corrected  for  minimum controllable airspeed (VMCA) and VMU3 if mission necessity dictates. 4.    Minimum runway required for normal landings is the charted landing distance over 50 foot obstacle with outboard engines in HSGI and inboard engines in max reverse.  RVR less than 40 (3/4  mile)  –  add  1,000  feet.    RVR  equal  to  or  greater  than  40  (3/4  mile)  –  add  500  feet.    If runway length available for landing is less than required by the previous criteria, crews may use landing  ground  roll  plus  1,500  feet  when  approved  by  the  squadron  commander.    In  this  case, you must ensure the landing touchdown is in the first 500 feet of the runway. 5.    Use  maximum  effort  landing  procedures  whenever  the  runway  available  for  landing  is  less than that required for a normal landing with outboard engines in high speed ground idle (HSGI) and inboard engines in Max Reverse (2OB HGI; 2IB REV in the performance manual) and max anti-skid braking.  Plan the touchdown within the first 500 feet of usable runway. 6.  Minimum runway length using max effort procedures is ground roll plus 500 feet if a 500 foot touchdown  zone  is  clearly  marked  on  the  runway.    If  the  touchdown  zone  is  greater  than  500 feet, or unmarked, minimum runway length is ground roll plus 1,000 feet.  7.    LZ  markings  may  vary  depending  upon  the  supporting  agency  (refer  to  AFI  13-217,  Drop Zone  and  Landing  Zone Operations).    Markings  being  used  will  be  established  during  mission planning and included in the aircrew briefing. 8.  On non-marked (AMP-4) runways, a go-around point will be identified to all crew members prior to execution. 6.24.  Airfield Requirements. 6.24.1.  On runways partially covered with snow or ice, takeoff computations will be based on the reported RSC or RCR for the cleared portion of the runway.  A minimum of 40 feet either side of centerline should be cleared (30 feet for maximum effort operations).  If 40 feet   110  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 either  side  of  centerline  is  not  cleared  (30  feet  for  max  effort  ops),  computations  will  be based on the non-cleared portion.  (T-2) 6.24.2.  Aircraft  Taxi  and  Taxi  Obstruction  Clearance  Criteria  and  Foreign  Object  Damage (FOD) Avoidance. 6.24.2.1.  Do  not  taxi  an  aircraft  within  25  feet  of  obstructions  without  wing  walkers monitoring  the  clearance  between  aircraft  and  obstruction.    (T-3)    With  wing  walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 feet.  (T-3)  Exception:  IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations  and  Movement  on  the  Ground,  aircraft  may  taxi  into  or  out  of  a  marked parking  spot  without  marshallers/wing  walkers  at  home  station  along  fixed  taxi  lines which have been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any permanent obstruction.    Adjacent  aircraft  are  considered  a  permanent  obstruction  provided  the aircraft is parked properly in its designated spot and not moving.  AGE and vehicles are considered  a  permanent  obstruction  provided  it  is  parked  entirely  within  a  designated area.  Areas will be designated by permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another suitable means. 6.24.2.2.  When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers.  (T-3)  If wing walkers  are  unavailable,  the  PIC  will  deplane  one  or  more  crew  members  to  maintain obstruction  clearance  and  provide  marshaling  using  AFI  11-218  signals.    Use  wing walkers,  deplaned  crew  members,  or  a  crew  member  on  interphone  positioned  at  the paratroop door(s) or ramp to act as an observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways.  During  night  taxi  operations,  marshallers  and  wing  walkers  will  have  an  illuminated wand  in  each  hand.    Observers  should  be  in  a  position  to  see  wing  walkers  at  all  times (through door or windows) and communicate with the pilot. 6.24.2.3.  Pilots  must  ensure  clearance  of  any  known  obstructions  that  penetrate  the shaded area in Figure 6.1.  (T-3) AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   111  Figure 6.1.  Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria.  6.24.2.4.  FOD Avoidance.  Make every effort to minimize the potential for FOD.  Crews should: 6.24.2.4.1.  Carefully  review  airfield  layout  during  mission  planning.    Be  familiar with taxi routes, turn requirements, and areas for potential FOD.  (T-3) 6.24.2.4.2.  Use  Low-Speed  Ground  Idle  when  practical.    Minimize  power  settings during all taxi operations.  (T-3) 6.24.2.5.  Reverse Taxi:  The PIC will coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals to be used with  the loadmaster and marshaller (when available).  (T-3)  Prior to  commencing reverse operations:  (T-3) 6.24.2.5.1.  Secure  all  cargo  and  ensure  all  passengers  are  seated  with  seatbelts fastened.  (T-3) 6.24.2.5.2.  Open  the  cargo  door  and  lower  the  ramp  to  approximately  12  inches above horizontal.  (T-3) 6.24.2.5.3.  The loadmaster will position himself on the aircraft ramp to direct reverse taxi, report any hazards, and to provide the pilot  with timely interphone instructions on turns, distance remaining, conditions of the maneuvering area, and stopping point.  (T-3) 6.24.2.5.4.  If four or more loading ramps or three canary slides are installed, at least one will be removed to allow unobstructed vision from the cargo ramp while backing.  (T-3) 6.24.2.6.  Do  not  taxi  within  25  feet  of  an  obstacle  nor  stop  less  than  25  feet  from  an obstruction even if using a wing walker.  (T-3)   112  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 6.24.2.7.  During  night  reverse taxi  operations, the pilot  and loadmaster  will ensure that the visibility in the taxi area is sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations.  (T-3) 6.24.3.  Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria.  (T-3) 6.24.3.1.  PICs  will  not  make  an  approach  or  landing  into  an  airfield  requiring certification  by  the  ASRR  unless  they  have  previously  operated  into  that  airfield  as  a pilot, copilot, or observer and reviewed the airfield certification briefing and audiovisual program within the time periods allotted by the ASRR. 6.24.3.2.  An airfield is considered suitable for C-130 operations when: 6.24.3.3.  No  obstructions  penetrate  into  the  shaded  area  of  Figure  6.2.    This  ensures obstruction clearance only if the aircraft is maintained within 35 feet of runway centerline and the angle of bank does not exceed 5°. 6.24.3.4.  When  an  obstruction  penetrates  the  shaded  area  of  Figure  6.2,  specific approval  by  the  Group  Commander/COMAFSOF  (for  contingency  operations)  is required  and  the  PIC  must  be  advised  of  the  height  and  location  of  the  obstruction,  as well as specific procedures to avoid the obstacle (i.e., landing beyond the obstacle).  (T-3) Figure 6.2.  Takeoff and Landing Clearance Criteria. 6.24.4.  Arresting Cables. 6.24.4.1.  Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include recessed cables).  If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower to have the cable inspected.  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   113  6.24.4.2.  Do  not  takeoff  or  land  over  an  approach  end  cable  that  has  been  reported  as slack, loose, or improperly rigged by Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS), or ATC. 6.24.4.3.  Operations  are  authorized  on  runways  where  BAK-12  systems  are  installed, with  an  eight  point  cable  tie-down  system,  without  regard  to  the  Dash-One  Caution.  When operating from runways equipped with other types of systems, or if it is unknown if  the  BAK-12  system  includes  eight  point  tie-downs,  aircrews  should  recognize  the increased risk of damage to the aircraft. 6.25.  Three-Engine Takeoffs.  Actual engine-out takeoffs require MAJCOM/A3 (COMAFSOF for contingency operations) waiver.  (T-3) 6.26.  Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces.  Aircrews should not attempt to recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto surfaces that are not suitable for taxi.  Ground crews using appropriate  equipment  will  normally  recover  the  aircraft.    Aircrews  may  recover  the  aircraft  at austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the PIC is sure there is no aircraft damage and the surface will support the aircraft. 6.27.  Engines  Running  Onload  or  Offload  (ERO).  Do  not  use  ERO  procedures  when explosive  cargo  (hazard  class  1.1-1.4)  is  involved  unless  authorized  by  the  Joint  Airborne/Air Transportability  Training  (JA/ATT)  or  exercise  operation  order  or  contingency  air  tasking orders.  Exception:  Small arms ammunition hazard class 1.4S may be on/offloaded using ERO procedures  providing  the  total  NEW  does  not  exceed  airfield  restrictions  at  the  assigned on/offload location. 6.27.1.  The  ERO  procedures  in  this  paragraph  may  be  used  for  any  mix  of  personnel  or cargo.  The aft cargo door and ramp is preferred when more than 10 passengers are involved.  The  PIC  will  assess  prevailing  weather,  lighting  and  parking  location  to  ensure  safe operations.  (T-3) 6.27.2.  General Procedures: 6.27.2.1.  The PIC will brief crew members on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing specific crew member duties.  (T-3) 6.27.2.2.  The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone and radio.  (T-3) 6.27.2.3.  Operate engines in ground idle (low speed, if applicable).  (T-3)  If conditions warrant, open air deflector doors and lower flaps to further reduce propeller blast. 6.27.2.4.  Turn wing leading edge lights on during night EROs.  (T-3)  Taxi lights may be used at the discretion of the pilot. 6.27.2.5.  Complete  passenger  and  cargo  manifests,  crew  lists  and  DD  Form  365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F, for the subsequent sortie.  Note:  DD Form 365-4 is not required for the subsequent sortie if the aircraft will depart empty. 6.27.2.6.  Resume  taxi  after  the  LM  has  verbally  acknowledged  the  aircraft  is  ready  to taxi.  (T3) 6.27.2.7.  Do  not  onload  or  offload  through  two  different  doors  simultaneously.   WARNING:  Due to the hazards involved (i.e., propeller blast, proximity to engines and   114  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 propellers, lack of paratroop door steps, etc.), only hand transferable items of cargo may be on/offloaded through the paratroop doors during EROs. 6.27.3.  Personnel onload and offload through the crew entrance door.  (T-3) 6.27.3.1.  The pilot will give clearance to open the crew entrance door.  (T-3) 6.27.3.2.  During  on/offload,  station  a  crew  member  (normally  the  LM)  on  interphone (cord held taut) approximately 25 ft and at a 45-degree angle from the aircraft axis.  (T-3) 6.27.3.3.  Brief deplaning personnel to remain forward of the interphone cord.  (T-3) 6.27.4.  Personnel or cargo on/offload through the aft cargo door and ramp.  (T-3) 6.27.4.1.  After the  aircraft has slowed to  taxi  speed, the  LM may  remove all tie-downs except  one  forward  and  one  aft  restraint.    Remove  remaining  restraints  only  after  the aircraft is stopped and vehicle drivers are in place.  (T-3)  Drivers will not release vehicle parking brakes until all restraints are removed and cleared to proceed by the LM.  (T-3) 6.27.4.2.  Upon clearance from  the pilot,  open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp  to horizontal.  (T-3) 6.27.4.3.  The  LM  will  direct  all  on/offload  operations  using  pre-briefed  signals.    (T-3)  Passengers will be escorted by a crew member when enplaning or deplaning.  (T-3) 6.27.4.4.  Other  qualified  LM  may  direct  the  operation,  if  available,  but  the  crew loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   115  Chapter 7 AIRCRAFT SECURITY 7.1.  General.  This chapter provides guidance for aircraft security on ground and in-flight.  This security  priority  designation  applies  to  operational  aircraft,  wherever  they  are  located, worldwide.    Some  aircraft  contain  equipment  and  documents  that  require  protection  per  DoD 5200.1, Vol 1-4, and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. 7.2.  Procedures.  The  PIC  is  ultimately  responsible  for  the  security  of  their  aircraft  when located  away  from  US  military  installations.    AFJI  31-102,  Physical  Security,  covers  security arrangements when US Air Force aircraft are located on other DoD installations.  Arrangements must be made to protect the aircraft during crew rest status at non-US protected locations.  If US military  security  forces  are  not  available,  the  US  embassy  assigned  to  that  country  must  be consulted to ensure security arrangements are made.  For missions involving a planning agency, the  agency  must  coordinate  with  the  PIC  to  ensure  the  planned  security  measures  conform  to mission  requirements.    The  amount  of  security  required  will  vary,  depending  on  location  and ground time.  (T-2) 7.2.1.  For  non-permissive  or  uncertain  environments,  airfield  and  LZ  security  is  the responsibility of the agency requesting the airlift.  Crew will work with the agency requesting the airlift to ensure security meets the requirement for the mission.  (T-3) 7.2.2.  For  permissive  environments,  PIC  will  receive  a  threat  assessment  and  force protection  capability  evaluation  briefing  at  home  station  prior  to  departure  and  receive updates  enroute,  if  required.    (T-3)    When  landing  at  DoD  component  installation,  the installation commander is responsible to provide adequate security for the aircraft.  The PIC will determine if security is adequate.  (T-3)  For planed overnight stops located at non-US military installations overseas and civilian airfields mission planners will work with SF, Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) Special Mission Branch (SMB) and the Threat Working  group  (TWG)  to  identify  when  security  and/or  Counter  Intelligence/Force Protection  measures  (CI/FP)  are  recommended  to  support  exercises,  training  missions, contingency operations and small/large scale deployments.  Normally the minimum members of the threat working group will be Security Forces, Intelligence, OSI and Medical.  Planning agencies  will  follow  guidance  in  AFSOCI  31-100,  Special  Operations  Security  Forces Deployment Planning and Operations.  (T2) 7.2.2.1.  Aircrew  surveillance.    If  the  aircraft  is  not  remaining  overnight,  aircrews  are capable  of  maintaining  appropriate  aircraft  security.    The  PIC  will  direct  armed  crew members  to  remain  with  the  aircraft  and  maintain  surveillance  of  aircraft  entrances  and activities in the aircraft vicinity.  (T-2) 7.2.2.2.  Area Patrol.  Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include back-up  response  forces.    If  local  authorities  request  payment  for  this  service,  use  AF Form 15, USAF Invoice. 7.2.2.3.  Departure  without  Crew  Rest.    If  local  security  forces  are  unacceptable  or unavailable,  the  PIC  may  waive  Flight  Duty  Period  restrictions  and  depart  as  soon  as possible for a destination with adequate force protection.  If unable to depart the location due to system malfunction, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability.    116  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 In  no  case,  will  the  entire  crew  leave  the  aircraft  unattended.    (T-3)    Crew  rest requirements  will  be  subordinate  to  aircraft  security  when  the  airframe  may  be  at  risk.  (T-3)  The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft protection  and  crew  rest  until  relief  is  available.    PIC  will  coordinate  through  home station channels to acquire additional security.  (T2) 7.2.3.  Tailored Security Measures. Standard physical security measures may be impractical at  times  due  to  mission,  terrain,  climate,  sociopolitical  sensitivities,  or  other  factors.    For example,  some  countries  don't  allow  armed  security  personnel.    On  other  deployments,  the mission  may  rely  on  maintaining  a  low  profile  and  attracting  as  little  attention  as  possible.  At  such  locations,  tailor  security  measures  to  meet  unique  requirements  when  necessary.  Plan  IAW  AFSOCI  31100,  Special  Operations  Security  Forces  Deployment  Planning  and Operations.    The  mission  commander  (MC)  must  approve  tailored  security  at  deployed locations  and  the  respective  Air  Operations  Center  (AOC)  must  be  notified  as  soon  as possible.    (T-3)    As  a  minimum,  lock  aircraft  entry  points  and  hatches.    (T-3)    If  it  is  not possible  to  lock  aircraft,  secure  aircraft  entry  points  and  hatches  in  a  manner  to  indicate unauthorized  entry,  i.e.,  taping  hatch  release  handles  or  using  seals.    Contact  with  US Embassy personnel is required at locations where security agreements are not in existence. 7.2.4.  Ground  Security  Teams.    Ground  security  teams  may  be  considered  to  guard  the aircraft for planned overnight stops.  Teams may travel in MEP status and are responsible to the PIC at all times.  The PIC will ensure security team members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress, and passenger briefings, as appropriate.  (T-3)  The squadron commander is the  final  approval  authority  for  the  need  of  ground  security  teams  for  their  aircraft  and authority may be delegated no lower than the PIC.  (T-3) 7.2.4.1.  Ground  security  teams  will  comply  with  AFMAN  24-204(I)  at  all  times  when carrying weapons, ammo and equipment onboard the aircraft. 7.2.4.2.  Due  to  the  sensitivity  of  weapons  in  foreign  countries,  ground  security  teams will keep their weapons  inside the aircraft and out  of sight of  foreign nationals, even if the FCG allows them to be carried outside the aircraft.  If a destination requires weapons be carried outside the aircraft, the controlling MAJCOM must approve such action prior to deployment.  (T-2) 7.2.5.  Unauthorized  entry.    If,  in  the  PIC’s  judgment,  the  aircraft  needs  to  be  locked  and sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry: 7.2.5.1.  Use the aircraft lock.  Note:  The aircraft should be locked during all off-station missions remaining overnight.  (T-3) 7.2.5.2.  If the aircraft lock is unavailable, secure the hatches and doors in a manner that will  indicate  unauthorized  entry.    For  example,  tape  inside  hatch  release  handles  to  the airframe, so that entry pulls the tape loose.  Close and seal the main crew entrance door or left troop door using a metal boxcar seal or other controllable device to identify forced entry.  Wipe the immediate area around the seal clean to help investigate forced entry.  If the  seals  are  damaged  or  have  been  tampered  with,  notify  the  appropriate  local authorities, the controlling agency, and inspect the aircraft thoroughly.  (T-3) 7.2.5.3.  Coordinate  with  the  local  base  operations  representative  on  procedures  for servicing the aircraft while the crew is away.  If a padlock is used, the key or combination AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   117  will  be  left  with  base  operations  or  the  representative  for  servicing  and  maintenance personnel.  (T-3) 7.2.6.  Security  awareness  is  crucial  to  effective  mission  accomplishment.    Aircrews  must always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.  During pre-flight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel-wells,  air  conditioning  compartments,  and  cargo  compartment  for  unauthorized  packages, personnel,  or  other  unfamiliar  devices.    (T-3)    Report  any  suspicious  items  to  host  security forces.    (T-3)    Aircrews  will  maintain  a  heightened  security  posture  throughout  all  pre-takeoff activities.  (T-3) 7.3.  AFSOC  SOF-Fly  Away  Security  Teams (FAST)  and  Aircraft  Security Recommendation  Matrix.  AFSOCI  31-100  has  outlined  planning  processes  and  provided  a matrix to aid the TWG in making a force protection recommendation.  Planning agencies and the TWG will use this matrix to help assess the risk to parked aircraft in a permissive environment.  This  matrix  will  be  used  for  planned  overnight  stops  at  non-US  military  installations  overseas and  civilian  airfields.    The  squadron  commander  or  mission  commander  is  the  final  approval authority for aircraft security issues.  (T-3)  Authority may be delegated no lower than the PIC.  (T-3)  Exception:  For unscheduled or emergency landings at unplanned airfields, the PIC will assess the aircraft security situation.  (T-3)  If the aircrew is not  capable of providing adequate security,  the  PIC  will  request/coordinate  security  through  available  channels  (US  Embassy  or United  States  Defense  Attaché  Office  (USDAO))  and  notify  the  respective  AOC  as  soon  as possible.  (T-3)   Note:  Normally, additional security for the aircraft is not required at military installation within a NATO country or US civilian airfields approved by the FAA/Transportation Security Agency (TSA). 7.4.  Protective  Standards  for  Aircraft  Carrying  Distinguished  Visitors.  This  paragraph applies specifically to aircraft transporting DV Code 4 or above.  PIC are responsible for aircraft security at en route stops.  (T-3) 7.4.1.  DoD Installations.  Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure times.  Request continuous security surveillance during the entire ground time.  (T-3)  If the installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available.  (T-3) 7.4.2.  Non-DoD  Installations.    Contact  the  airport  manager  or  installation  commander  to arrange  for  force  protection.    (T-3)    If  available  security  is  inadequate,  purchase  additional security using AF Form 15. 7.5.  Arming of Crew members.  Crew Members will be armed IAW with AFI 31-117, Arming and  Use  of  Force  by  Air  Force  Personnel,  and  AFMAN  31-229,  USAF  Weapons  Handling Manual.    When  directed,  at  least  one  crew  member  each  from  the  flight  deck  and  cargo compartment will carry weapons. 7.5.1.  Issue.  Before departing home station, authorized crew members will obtain weapons, ammunition,  lock,  and  key.    (T-3)    Crew  members  must  present  a  current  AF  Form  523, USAF  Authorization  to  Bear  Firearms,  to  be  issued  a  weapon.    Crew  members  will  be reissued the same weapon until  the mission terminates at  home station.  (T-3)   If an  armed crew member must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member, using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.   118  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 7.5.2.  Loading  and  Transfer  of  Weapons.    Load  and  unload  weapons  at  approved  clearing barrels/facilities  if  available.    (T-3)    To  transfer  a  loaded  weapon  to  another  crew  member, place the weapon on a flat surface.  (T-3)  Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.  (T-3) 7.5.3.  Wearing of Weapons.  Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the identity of armed crew members.  (T-3)  Do not wear weapons off the flight line, except to and  from  the  unit  operations  center,  armories,  and  other  facilities  associated  with  aircrew activities  such  as  base  operations,  fleet  service,  cargo  or  passenger  terminals,  flight  line cafeterias, snack bars, etc.  (T-3) 7.5.4.  Weapons Storage.  Crew members will be armed before beginning preflight or on-load duties.    (T-3)    When  no  passengers  are  on  board  and  after  a  satisfactory  stowaway  check, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight.  If no gun box is available retain weapon for the duration of the flight.  Crew members will rearm before landing.  (T-3)  Weapons need not be unloaded before being placed in the gun box. 7.5.5.  Crew  Rest.    During  crew  rest,  store  weapons  in  the  most  secure  facility  available, normally  the  base  armory.    If  a  weapons  storage  facility  is  unavailable  or  the  country prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box. 7.5.5.1.  Aircraft  without  a  Gun  Box.    If  an  aircraft  without  a  gun  box  must  remain overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the nearest  acceptable  facility.    Acceptable  storage  facilities  are  US  or  Allied  military services  armories  US  National  Guard  and  Reserve  armories,  and  US  civil  law enforcement  armories.    If  none  of  these  are  available,  or  the  PIC  believes  weapons security may be compromised, crew members may secure their weapons in their quarters, one  crew  member  will  remain  with  the  weapons  at  all  times.    In  this  case,  turn  the ammunition over to the PIC.  (T-3) 7.6.  General  Anti-Hijacking Guidance.  Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist an  aircraft  hijacking  attempt,  resistance  may  vary  from  dissuasion,  to  direct  physical confrontation,  including  the  use  of  deadly  force.    Due  to  the  sensitive  nature  of  anti-hijacking procedures,  crew  members  should  reference  AFI  13-207,  Preventing  and  Resisting  Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) For Official Use Only (FOUO) and the FIH for specific guidance.  Aircrews will  not  release  any  information  concerning  those  procedures  or  hijacking  attempts.    Anti-hijacking  is  a  crew  duty  performed  exclusively  by  aircrew  personnel.    The  hijacking  of  an AFSOC  aircraft  could  create  a  serious  international  incident  and  jeopardize  the  safety  of passengers  and  property.    An  aircraft  is  most  vulnerable  when  the  crew  is  on  board  and  the aircraft  is  ready  for  flight.    Hijackers  cannot  be  dealt  with  as  ordinary  criminals.    Some  are mentally  disturbed,  emotionally  unstable  individuals  for  whom  the  threat  of  death  is  not  a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime.  Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and property.  Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the problem. 7.6.1.  Acceptance  of  Passengers.    The  host  station  passenger  processing  and  manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections.  Do not board passengers unless the PIC is fully  satisfied  with  these  inspections.    (T-3)    Exception:    Supporting/supported  forces  may be anti-hijack inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   119  7.6.1.1.  Aeromedical Procedures.  Military medical facility commanders are responsible for the anti-hijacking inspection of patients.   When patients  are delivered to  the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure. 7.6.1.2.  Contingency  and  exercise  movements.    During  contingencies  in  support  of combat operations and exercises involving the movement of large numbers of personnel, the supported unit should manifest passengers and perform anti-hijacking inspections. 7.6.2.  Arms  and  Ammunition.    Passengers  (including  MEP)  will  not  carry  weapons  and/or ammunition  on  their  person  or  in  hand-carried  baggage  on  board  an  aircraft.    Exception:  Special  Agents/Guards  of  the  Secret  Service  or  State  Department,  and  other  individuals specifically authorized to carry weapons with coordination of the PIC.  In all cases, the crew will be aware of location of weapons and ammunition.  (T-3) 7.6.2.1.  If individuals must  clear their weapons  before boarding the aircraft, and  access to clearing barrel/facilities is limited, as a minimum, direct them to: 7.6.2.1.1.  Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or personnel before un-holstering/un-slinging their weapons.  (T-3) 7.6.2.1.2.  Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.  (T-3) 7.6.2.2.  Troops and deadhead crew members will not retain custody of ammunition on an aircraft  but  will  turn  it in  to  the  troop  commander  or  PIC.    Exception:   During  combat operations,  troops  may  carry  unloaded  weapons  and  ammunition  on  board  the  aircraft.  When  the  tactical  situation  dictates,  personnel  who  will  engage  an  enemy  force immediately  upon  deplaning  at  the  objective  may  carry  loaded  weapons  aboard  the aircraft at the discretion of the troop commander/team leader, with the PIC’s concurrence.  Weapons will not be breached until clear of the aircraft.  (T-3) 7.7.  Specific  Anti-Hijacking  Guidance.  It  is  imperative  that  all  crew  members  are  familiar with  the  ground  and  in-flight  resistance  actions,  covert  communications  and  forced  penetration of unfriendly airspace procedures in AFI 13-207 and the FIH.  In the event of a hijacking, crew members  must  act  immediately  and  resourcefully,  without  instruction,  in  order  to  counter  the attacker successfully.   120  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Chapter 8 OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS 8.1.  General.  This  chapter  contains  a  description  of  applicable  reports  and  forms.    For assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, unit, or local flight safety officer. 8.2.  AF  Form  457,  USAF  Hazard  Report.  Refer  to  AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air  Force  Mishap Prevention  Program.    The  USAF  hazard  reporting  system  provides  a  means  for  Air  Force personnel  to  alert  supervisors  and  commanders  to  hazardous  conditions  requiring  prompt corrective  action.    A  hazard  is  any  condition,  act,  or  circumstance  that  jeopardizes  or  may jeopardize  the  health  and  well-being  of  personnel,  or  which  may  result  in  loss,  damage,  or destruction of any weapons system, equipment, facility, or material resource. 8.3.  AF  Form  651,  Hazardous  Air  Traffic  Report.  Refer  to  AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air  Force Mishap Prevention Program, Attachment 3. 8.3.1.  The  Air  Force  HATR  program  provides  a  means  for  personnel  to  report  all  near midair  collisions  and  alleged  hazardous  air  traffic  conditions.    Use  information  in  HATR reports only for mishap prevention. 8.3.2.  Procedures: 8.3.2.1.  Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g.,  center,  FSS,  control  tower,  or  aeronautical  radio  station),  and  give  the  following information as appropriate: 8.3.2.1.1.  Identification or call sign. 8.3.2.1.2.  Time and place (radial/DME, position relative to the airfield, etc.). 8.3.2.1.3.  Altitude or flight level. 8.3.2.1.4.  Description of the other aircraft or vehicle. 8.3.2.1.5.  Include  a  verbal  statement  as  soon  as  possible  after  occurrence  that  a written  HATR  report  will  be  filed  upon  landing.    Note:    ATC  agencies  (e.g.,  FAA, etc.) must know if an official report is being filed. 8.3.2.2.  File the HATR as soon as possible (within 24 hours) using any available means of  communication.    Normally,  it  should  be  filed  at  the  base  operations  office  at  the landing  airport.    If  this  is  impractical  and  if  communications  permit,  notify  the  safety office of the Air Force base where the condition occurred, the safety office at the home station, or as prescribed by the overseas MAJCOM.  In any case, provide the safety office with  all  available  information  needed  to  prepare  AF  Form  651,  Hazardous  Air  Traffic Report.    Turn  in  a  completed  copy  of  AF  Form  651  to  the  wing/group  safety  office.  Note:    HATR  reports  are  not  privileged  information  and  may  be  released  outside  the USAF. 8.3.3.  Individuals  submitting  a  HATR  are  granted  immunity  from  disciplinary  action provided: 8.3.3.1.  Their violation was not deliberate. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   121  8.3.3.2.

Instructor/Flight Examiner Briefings.  Before all training/evaluation missions, the PIC or instructors/flight  examiners  will  brief  their  crew  on  the  training/evaluation  requirements, objectives, planned profiles, and seat changes.  (T-3) 9.3.  Debriefing.  Review and assess overall training performed.  Each student or crew member should thoroughly understand what training has been accomplished.  All required documentation should be completed as expeditiously as possible. 9.4.  Simulated Emergency Flight Procedure(s) (EP). 9.4.1.  Simulate EP (engine shutdown, placing switches in other than their normal positions, or  an  abnormal  configuration  such  as  no  flap  landings  or  simulated  engine  failure)  only during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is in  one of the pilot seats.  (T-3)   Instructor pilot candidates who occupy  a pilot  seat  and are under  the  supervision  of  a  flight  examiner  pilot,  not  in  a  pilot  seat,  may  practice  simulated emergency  procedures  during  initial  or  requalification  upgrade  evaluations.    Preface  all simulated emergencies with the word "simulated" and terminate simulated emergencies if an actual emergency arises.  (T-3) 9.4.1.1.  Do  not  conduct  simulated  engine-out  training  when  a  fuel  indication  system failure exists. 9.4.2.  One  power  lever  may  be  retarded  to  FLIGHT  IDLE  at  not  less  than  VMCA1  (one-engine inoperative, out of ground effect) not less than 300 feet AGL. 9.4.3.  Turns into the simulated inoperative engine should be minimized.  Such turns require a  higher  degree  of  pilot  skill  than  with  actual  inoperative  engines  and  must  be  smooth  and coordinated.     WARNING:  Improper rudder or power application can lead to an immediate out-of-control condition where recovery may not be possible. 9.4.4.  Simulated  EPs  are  prohibited  with  passengers  on  board  unless  such  personnel  are required for mission accomplishment, such as FCF and test missions.  Limit personnel to the absolute minimum required. 9.4.5.  Conduct  simulated  EPs  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  Chapter  5,  and  this instruction.  Use a  realistic EP  scenario and do not  compound  EP.    Limit simulated EPs to noncritical  phases  of  flight  when  possible.    Notify  the  controlling  agency  if  a  nonstandard traffic pattern or pattern requiring special sequencing is anticipated.  (T-3) 9.5.  Maneuver Restrictions.

Touch-and-go  landings  are  normally  performed  at  flight  idle.    Brief  the  crew  if performing a ground idle touch-and-go landing.  Do not perform no-flap ground idle touch-and-go landings. 9.6.4.  Touch-and-go landings are not authorized when normal wake turbulence criteria is not met  or  when  intercepting  or  crossing  the  flight  path  of  a  large  multi-engine  jet  during approach or landing. 9.6.5.  Minimum runway length for 50% flap flight idle touch-and-go landings is 5,000 feet.  (T3)  Minimum runway length for all other touch-and-go landings is 6,000 feet.  (T-3) 9.7.  Stop-and-Go Landings. 9.7.1.  Authorized only on EC-130J (SJ) designated training, evaluation, or currency missions.  Any EC-130J qualified pilot may perform stop-and-go landings if: 9.7.1.1.  The  crosswind  component  corrected  for  RCR  is  within  the  recommended  zone of the landing crosswind chart.  Ceiling and visibility must be at least 300 feet and 3/4-mile or 300 feet and RVR 40.   130  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 9.7.1.2.  Minimum braking is used to stop. 9.7.1.3.  The runway remaining for takeoff is greater than CFL. 9.7.2.  Stop-and-Go Landings are not authorized: 9.7.2.1.  In conjunction with no-flap landings. 9.7.2.2.  When  normal  wake  turbulence  criteria  is  not  met,  or  when  intercepting  or crossing the flight path of a large multi-engine jet during approach or landing. 9.8.  Maximum Effort. 9.8.1.  Minimum  runway  length  is  3,000  feet  or  IAW  Paragraph  5.24.2  and  5.24.3, whichever is greater. 9.8.2.  Takeoff  speed  will  be  Adjusted  Max  Effort  Rotation  Speed  (AMAX).

Landing  Restrictions  with  Airdrop  Loads.  Pilot  proficiency/multiple/assault  landings will  not  be  accomplished  with  non-unilateral  airdrop  loads  onboard  the  aircraft  (i.e.,  Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC), Bike Bundles, and Rigging Alternate Method Zodiac (RAMZ) in order to prevent damage to actual loads.  (T-3)  If landings are accomplished with training loads (i.e., SATB, 55 gallon drum CDS loads, concrete blocks) on the aircraft, the loadmaster will re-inspect the load prior to airdrop.  (T-3)  If any damage is noted on the honeycomb, skid board, ties,  lashings,  etc.,  the  load  will  be  returned  to  Aerial  Delivery.    (T-3)    Training  loads  may remain  onboard  during  assault  landings  and  may  be  dropped  after  they  are  re-inspected  by  the loadmaster prior to the airdrop.  The intent is not to negatively impact training, but at the same time, minimize assault landings with training loads on board. 9.11.  Simulated  Instrument  Flight.  Simulated  instrument  flight  may  be  flown  and  logged without use of a vision-restricting device.  The use of a hood or other artificial vision-restricting device for any phase of flight is prohibited. 9.12.  Air-to-Air  Refueling  Training  Restrictions.  During  training  missions  the  override signal amplifier will not be used.  (T-3) AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   131  9.13.  Senior  Staff  Officers  Policy.  Senior  staff  members  (pilots  only)  or  O-coded  pilots  who have  completed  the  C-130J  Senior  Staff  Familiarization  course  will  occupy  the  left  pilot  seat only and be under direct IP supervision.  (T-3)  Pilots flying under indoctrination status will not control the aircraft during:  (T-3) 9.13.1.  Takeoff, landing, or instrument approaches when the weather is below 1500/3.  (T-3) 9.13.2.  In-Flight Refueling (receiver only).  (T-3) 9.13.3.  Tactical Low-Level.  (T-3) 9.13.4.  In-flight emergencies (actual or simulated).  (T-3)   132  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Chapter 10 LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 10.1.  General. 10.1.1.  EC-130J  flying  units  will  develop  a  supplement  to  this  chapter  for  local  operating procedures, as applicable to this instruction. 10.1.2.  The  supplement  should  not  duplicate  and  will  not  be  less  restrictive  than  the provisions  of  this  or  any  other  publication  without  prior  authorization  from  the  appropriate MAJCOM.  (T2) 10.1.3.  The supplement will be distributed to the MAJCOM, as applicable. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   133  Chapter 11 NAVIGATION PROCEDURES 11.1.  General. 11.1.1.  Definitions and Terminology. 11.1.1.1.  Category I (CAT I) Route.  Any route that does not meet the requirements of a CAT II route, including tactical navigation and overwater routes. 11.1.1.2.  Category  II  (CAT  II)  Route.    Any  route  on  which  the  position  of  the  aircraft can  be  accurately  determined  by  the  overhead  crossing  of  a  radio  aid  (NDB,  VOR)  or intersection  of  at  least  two  radio  aid  radials  (VOR,  TACAN)  or  one  radial  (VOR, TACAN) and one DME at least once each hour. 11.1.1.3.  Controlling  Navigation  Solution.    The  controlling  EGI  (INAV)  navigation solution  the  mission  computer  is  using  for  en  route  navigation.    The  SHIP  SOLN, selected via the NAV SELECT page of the AMU, determines which will be used to steer the aircraft either manually or with the autopilot. 11.1.1.4.  First  Suitable Airfield (FSAF) and  Last  Suitable Airfield (LSAF).  Utilized in the equal time point (ETP) calculation.  These are represented as the―First Nearest and the―Last  Nearest  airports  in  the ETP  calculation in  the PROGRESS pages of the CNI.  They  are  airports  closest  to  the  coast  out  and  coast  in  waypoints  that  meet  applicable criteria  for  C-130J  operations.    Forecast  weather  for  the  FSAF  and  LSAF  must  meet destination weather minimum filing requirements. 11.1.1.5.  Equal  Time  Point  (ETP).    Geographic  point  along  the  route  from  which  the flight time to the FSAF or the LSAF is equal. 11.1.1.6.  Required Navigation Performance (RNP).  RNP accuracy standards require an aircraft  to  remain  within  a  specific  number  of  nautical  miles  of  its  cleared  course centerline for 95% of the duration of the flight.  The associated track containment limit is twice the RNP value and represents the maximum limit of protected airspace.  Airspace where RNP is applied is considered special qualification airspace.  Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas.  RNP airspace is being  incorporated  around  the  world  to  increase  air  traffic  capacity  by  decreasing separation requirements between routes.  Refer to FLIP Area Planning publications/charts to determine RNP airspace. 11.1.1.7.  Minimum  Navigation  Performance  Specifications  (MNPS)  Airspace.    MNPS airspace exists in both the North Atlantic Region (NAT) and certain Canadian portions of the  North  American  Region.    Refer  to  FLIP  Area  Planning  publications/charts  to determine  MNPS  airspace.    The  C-130J  must  comply  with  all  MNPS  equipment requirements when flying within the lateral dimensions of this airspace.  Aircraft meeting the  North  Atlantic  MNPS  requirements  also  meet  the  Canadian  MNPS  requirements.  Aircraft  entering  MNPS  airspace  are  required  to  have  two  Long  Range  Navigation Systems (LRNS) capable of staying within 12.6 nm of cleared track for 95% of the flight.  Gross  navigation  errors  are  those  that  exceed  24  nm  from  track  center  line.    Prior  to entering  MNPS  airspace,  both  INSs  must  be  fully  operational  to  meet  the  MNPS   134  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 requirement  of  having  two  fully  serviceable  LRNSs.    In  order  to  signify  that  a  flight  is approved to  operate in  NAT MNPS airspace, the letter―X will be inserted within item 10 of the DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan. 11.1.1.8.  NAT  Tracks.    Contained  within  the  North  Atlantic  MNPS  airspace  is  an organized track system (NAT Tracks) between FL 285 and FL 420 to optimize air traffic flow  between  the  North  American  and  European  continents.    NAT  tracks  are  designed based on meteorological data and are updated twice daily.  When flying over the North Atlantic, crews should obtain a copy of the North Atlantic Tracks (NAT tracks) valid for their coast out time from the DoD NOTAM internet site. 11.1.1.9.  Reduced  Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  Airspace.    This  airspace requires special certification and exists to increase airspace capacity, safely, by reducing vertical separation from 2,000’ to 1,000’ between suitably equipped aircraft.  RVSM has been  implemented  in  the  CONUS,  Europe,  Africa,  and  Middle  East.    RVSM  airspace typically extends from FL 290 through FL 410.  Consult AP/1 and AP/2 for locations and lateral and vertical dimensions of this airspace. 11.2.  Mission Planning Procedures. 11.2.1.  Mission/Route  Planning.    Aircrew  will  normally  accomplish  and  verify  mission planning while in a flight planning facility/base operations; the data is then loaded manually (or via the data transfer card) into the CNI.  Pilots will also calculate and verify the required ramp fuel load.  (T-3) 11.2.2.1.  When  practical,  aircrew  will  plan  the  most  direct  routing  possible  or  utilize wind optimized CFP routing to enhance fuel conservation. 11.2.2.2.  Computer  Flight  Plan  (CFP).    Optimized  routing  with  applied  forecast  winds can  be  obtained  from  advanced  computer  flight  plan  (ACFP)  (USAF)  or  optimum  path routing system  (OPARS) United States  Navy  (USN).  ACFP 4.0 can produce  a .rte file that PFPS can recognize and open.  Use initial ATC cruise ceiling for the enroute altitude when not restricted by fuel temperature freezing limits.  (T-3)  Update actual flight level winds using the N-PFPS WX utility if necessary.  (T-3) 11.2.2.3.  Verify the CFP for route definition and accuracy, paying particular attention to adherence with over flight clearances.  (T-3) 11.2.2.4.  Refer to Chapter 12 to accomplish fuel planning. 11.2.3.  Equal Time Point (ETP) Computations. 11.2.3.1.  Refer  to  Chapter  12  for  ETP  Computations.    The  ETP  provides  crews  a  tool for  recovery  airfield  decision-making  when  in-flight  emergencies  occur.   ETP computations  are  required  on  CAT  I  routes  when  the  total  time  between  the  LSAF  and FSAF is  5 hours or more.  (T-3)  ETPs must be annotated and plotted on the MPC and MFP  prior  to  the  coast-out  waypoint.    (T-3)    Computer  programs  which  use  similar algorithms as the manual computation may be used.  Enter ETP information into the CNI PROGRESS  page  during  preflight.    CNI-computed  ETPs  only  become  accurate  upon reaching the PERF CRUISE altitude.  CNI-computed ETPs can be obtained for different airspeeds (i.e., 260 KTAS for a 3-engine scenario). AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   135  11.2.3.2.  The blocks provided on top of the C130J PFPS CFP should be used to record information needed by the CNI to compute an ETP.  These blocks and provided formulas also serve as a worksheet for crews to do the manual ETP computation.  The ACFP flight plan has information  on  the bottom  of the flight  plan for manual  ETP  calculations (See Figure  11.3  and  Figure  11.4  for  sample  CFP).    If  using  the  computer  programs  or  the CNI,  annotate  applicable  information  on  the  Master  Flight  Plan  (MFP).    If  the  CNI  is used, annotate―CNI in the master flight plan blocks for which the CNI does not present a number. 11.2.3.3.  To compute a manual ETP: 11.2.3.3.1.  Identify  and  record  the  LSAF,  coast-out  point,  approximate  midpoint  of the  CAT  I  portion,  coast-in  point,  and  FSAF.    The  coast-out  point,  approximate midpoint,  and  coast-in  point  are  actual  waypoints  on  the  flight  plan.    The  coast-out point for ETP purposes must occur after initial level-off.  (T-3) 11.2.3.3.2.  Determine and record the distance from the LSAF to the FSAF (entering the two airfields and approximate midpoint into PFPS is an easy way to do this).  (T-3) 11.2.3.3.3.  Determine  and  record  the  average  groundspeed  (GS)  for  the  first-half (coast-out to midpoint) and second-half (midpoint to coast-in) of the CAT I portion.  (T-3)    Divide  the  respective  en-route  distance  by  the  en-route  time  to/from  the midpoint to determine accurate average GS. 11.2.3.3.4.  Calculate  a  wind  factor  (WF1  &  WF2)  for  each  half  by  subtracting  the flight-planned average TAS from the averaged GS.  (T-3)  If a tailwind is experienced the WF will be positive.  If a headwind is experienced the WF will be negative. 11.2.3.3.5.  Use  the  provided  formulas  to  compute  the  time  it  takes  to  fly  from  the ETP to the FSAF.  (T-3)  Use this time and the second-half-averaged GS to calculate a  distance  from  the  FSAF  that  the  ETP  occurs.    Note:    The  ETP  will  always  occur upwind of the geographic midpoint.  Refer to Table 11.1. Table 11.1.  ETP. TIME in hours (ETP-FSAF) = DISTANCE (LSAF-FSAF) (WF2 – WF1) + 2TAS DISTANCE (ETP-FSAF) = TIME (ETP-FSAF) * GS (2nd half) 11.2.3.3.6.  The  INDEX  FROM/TO  and  PROGRESS  pages  may  also  be  utilized  in flight to update times and distances to diversion  bases along the route of flight.  An accurate GS must be entered in order to obtain correct ETE calculations. 11.3.  Master Flight Plan and Master Plotting Chart. 11.3.1.  One CFP and one plotting chart will be used as master copies for each flight utilizing CAT I procedures.  Both will be labeled―MASTER COPY‖ and will be referred to as MFP and Master Plotting Chart (MPC).   136  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 11.3.2.  MFP Usage.  The MFP is normally maintained by the CSO or PM but should be kept readily available to both pilots.  It will be used to record the following in flight: 11.3.2.1.  All ATC clearances and changes to clearances. 11.3.2.2.  The  wind,  temperature,  altitude,  fuels  remaining,  and  the  bearing/range between  the  INAV  solutions  over  waypoints  bordering  and  within  CAT  I  Navigation airspace. 11.3.2.3.  Any loss or degraded navigation/avionics equipment. 11.3.2.4.  Compass deviation checks. 11.3.2.5.  Oceanic Navigation Accuracy Check. 11.3.3.  MFP Symbology.  Use the following symbology to ensure that both pilots/CSO can easily  determine  which  waypoints  have  been  programmed  into  the  CNI-MU,  which programmed  waypoints  have  been  verified,  and  which  waypoints  have  been  transitioned  in flight. 11.3.3.1.  Place  a  check-mark  next  to  the  waypoint  to  signify  the  waypoint  has  been entered into the CNI-MU and the course and distance have been verified. 11.3.3.2.  Circle  the  check-mark  to  signify  the  coordinates,  course  and  distance  in  the CNI-MU have been verified by another crew member. 11.3.3.3.  Draw one diagonal line through the circled check-mark to signify the waypoint has  been  passed,  reported,  and  all  applicable  annotations  associated  with  waypoint passage have been completed. 11.3.3.4.  Cross the first  diagonal  line with  another to  signify that the aircraft‘s position has  been  plotted  on  the  MPC  approximately  60  nm  (10  to  15  minutes  depending  on groundspeed) after waypoint passage. 11.3.4.  MPC Usage.  The use of a plotting chart is required on every route requiring CAT I Navigation.  (T-3)  Use an appropriate Jet Navigation Chart-High Altitude (JNCA) or higher chart  with  Lambert  Conformal  Conic  (LCC)  projection.    (T-3)    During  mission  planning, draw  the  course  line  representing  the  planned  route  of  flight  on  the  MPC  and  highlight  the associated suitable emergency airfields, A/R abort bases and associated divert airfields, ETP, LSAF  and  FSAF.    (T-3)    The  PIC  will  verify  this  information  and  annotate  the  chart  with his/her signature, date, and mission number/call sign.  (T-3)  During flight, 10 to 15 minutes (depending on groundspeed) after each CAT I waypoint, the PM/CSO will mark position and then  plot  the  INS-only  position  on  the  MPC  (using  a  dot  surrounded  by  a  triangle)  and annotate the marked time and position coordinates adjacent to the plot.  (T-3)  The PM/CSO should  compare  the  plotted  point  to  the  course  line.    This  procedure  confirms  that  the navigation system is steering the airplane to the correct waypoint. 11.4.  Pre-Flight Procedures. 11.4.1.  Pre-flight procedures must include a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time check and resynchronization of the aircraft master clock, if necessary.  (T-3)  Aircraft clock errors resulting in position report time errors can lead to an erosion of actual longitudinal separation between  aircraft.    Acceptable  time  standards  that  can  be  used  include  GPS  (corrected  to AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   137  UTC),  Naval  Observatory  Master  Clock  (DSN  762-1401/1069  or  560-6742),  and  WWV (2500, 5000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 kHz). 11.4.2.  Pre-Flight  Communications  Check.    A  pre-flight  check  of  the  SATCOM  (if equipped) and HF radios should be made to a suitable agency (operating authority, command post or ATC).  At least one HF radio must be confirmed operational prior to coast out or the mission must be terminated.  (T-3) 11.4.3.  Navigation  Initialization  and  Solutions.    Both  the  AUTONAV  and  manual  gyro compass  (GC)  alignment  of  the  INSs  result  in  the  required  navigation  performance  needed for  RNP  RNAV  operation.    The  GPS  positions  may  be  used  as  initial  positions  as  long  as they  agree  within  one-tenth  of  one  minute.    If  GPS  is  not  available,  use  precision  parking coordinates  or,  as  a  last  resort,  obtain  coordinates  from  an  airfield  diagram  published  in  an approved  instrument  approach  book.    This  position  must  be  checked  and  verified  by  both pilots and recorded on the MFP.  (T-3)   In 11.4.4.  Communication/Navigation/Identification  Management  System  (CNI-MS). addition to Chapter 5 requirements, when configuring for CAT I operations, both pilots will verify that the INAV Position Alert 1 is set to 4.0 miles and INAV Position Alert 2 is set to 8.0  miles  on  the  CNI  PROGRESS  page.    (T-3)    This  will  generate  an  INAV  POS DIFFERENCE  Advisory  at  4.0  miles  and  an  INAV  POS  MISCOMPARE  Caution  at  8.0 miles. 11.4.5.  Loading the Route of Flight.  Because CAT I routes usually involve the manual input of waypoints not found in the database, and often require aircraft maximum range capability, it is critical that both pilots and CSO work in sequence and independently to  enter accurate route-of-flight data.  It is not sufficient for one crew member to simply observe another crew member entering the data.  The following steps will be completed by the pilots and CSO:  (T-3) 11.4.5.1.  The CSO or one of the pilots will:  (T-3) 11.4.5.1.1.  Load  the  route  of  flight  directly  from  the  filed  flight  plan,  MFP  or  data transfer card into the CNI and verify both the magnetic course and the leg distance for each waypoint with the MFP.  (T-3)  Loading the route directly from the filed flight plan  may  minimize  pilot/controller  clearance  loop  (misinterpretation)  errors.    Label waypoints so they can be readily identified for subsequent position reporting.  (T-3)  If the courses differ by  more than 2° or the distances differ by more than 2 nm,  the pilot  will  resolve  the  discrepancy  prior  to  flight.    Completion  of  this  step  will  be annotated with a check-mark next to the waypoint.  (T-3) 11.4.5.1.2.  Using  the  LEGS  pages,  insert  the  forecast  winds  (if  available)  at  each waypoint.  (T3) 11.4.5.1.3.  Verify the total distance to the destination on the CNI PROGRESS page.  (T-3)    Any  significant  disparity  (more  than  25  nm  to  allow  for  SIDs/Standard Terminal Arrival Route(s) (STAR) and approaches) in the total distance between the CNI and MFP will require a recheck of the ramp position and waypoint coordinates.   138  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 11.4.5.2.  The  other  pilot  or  CSO  will  verify  the  waypoint  coordinates  and  course  and distance information from the opposite side CNI to the MFP.  (T-3)  Completion of this step will be annotated with the check-mark being circled on the MFP.  (T-3) 11.4.5.3.  If  the  planned  route  of  flight  is  a  stored  route  or  one  loaded  during  a  data transfer,  verification  of  waypoint  coordinates  must  still  be  accomplished  by  both pilots/CSO in the same manner.  (T-3) 11.5.  CAT I Navigation Procedures. 11.5.1.  This  section  provides  general  procedures  and  guidance  for  the  operation  of navigation  systems  on  CAT  I  routes.    For  navigation  system  requirements,  consider  all oceanic  airspace  as  MNPS  airspace.    Specific  procedures  for  RNP  RNAV  airspace  are addressed in subsequent sections. 11.5.2.  Refer to Chapter  4 for the navigation Minimum Equipment  List (MEL) for CAT I and RNP RNAV operations. 11.5.3.  Navigation System Accuracy Checks. 11.5.3.1.  Ground.  After leaving the ramp, perform the INS/INAV groundspeed check by stopping  the  aircraft  and  checking  each  pilot‘s  groundspeed  on  the  CNI-MU  or HDD/HUD.    Groundspeeds  in  excess  of  1  knot  while  the  aircraft  is  stationary  may indicate a faulty INS.  (T3) 11.5.3.2.  Airborne.    Determine  INAV  position  accuracy  by  comparing  it  to  en  route NAVAID.  (T-3) 11.5.3.3.  Compass Deviation Check.  Perform a compass deviation check using both INS and  the  standby  compass  prior  to  entering  CAT  I  airspace.    (T-3)    Perform  subsequent checks  after  heading  changes  of  30°  (or  greater)  or  every  3  hours.    (T-3)    Record  the deviation in the appropriate block of the MFP.  (T-3)  Apply this correction to headings to  be  flown  whenever  it  is  necessary  to  use  the  standby  compass  as  the  sole  source  for navigation.  (T-3) 11.5.3.4.  Oceanic Navigation Accuracy Check.  Prior to coast-out, evaluate/compare the accuracy of all navigation solutions.  (T-3)  In the event of discrepancies, greater than 4 nm,  the  crew  should  investigate  the  cause  and  determine  if  CAT  I  flight  is  feasible.  Record this gross error check in the appropriate block of the MFP.  (T-3)  If a pure INS position is determined to be more than 4 miles in error, an in-flight alignment (IFA) may be  accomplished  provided  sufficient  time  is  available  prior  to  entering  RNP  RNAV  or oceanic airspace.  If coast-out is made at a radial/DME fix, the appropriate radial should be  selected  on  the  non-active  CDI  as  a  further  check  that  the  navigation  system  is tracking to the fix. 11.5.4.  Communications.  In addition to guidance in Chapter  5, crews will accomplish the following:  (T-3) 11.5.4.1.  Emergency Frequency Monitoring.  In the interest of safety during oceanic and remote  area  operations  (100  nm  offshore),  flights  should  maintain  a  listening  watch  on 121.5 and 243.0 MHz and the VHF common frequency.  (T-3) AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   139  11.5.4.2.  BIU Backup.  Ensure that one of the pilots place their transmission switch to an HF radio so that the crew can transmit on HF in case of BIU Backup.  (T-3)  The other pilot should select VHF 2 for the same reason.  VHF 1 will be available on the Get Home Control and crew can attempt to relay transmissions to other aircraft on 121.5 until within VHF range of ATC. 11.5.5.  Oceanic Clearance:  If not received before take-off, the oceanic clearance should be obtained prior to the boundary of oceanic airspace IAW FLIP. 11.5.5.1.  The clearance will be recorded on the MFP, and reviewed by both pilots/CSO.  (T-3)   If the oceanic clearance received is  different  from  the planned clearance, use the following procedures:  (T-3) 11.5.5.1.1.  Record  the  new  route  on  the  MFP  to  include  applicable  updates  to  ETP data.  (T-3) 11.5.5.1.2.  Enter  the  new  waypoints  into  the  CNI  in  accordance  with  the  pre-flight procedures in this chapter.  (T-3) 11.5.5.1.3.  Ensure  fuel  will  still  be  sufficient  to  arrive  at  the  destination  waypoint with required reserves.  (T-3) 11.5.5.1.4.  Mark out the old plotted track and draw the revised plot on the MPC.  (T-3) 11.5.5.1.5.  In no case should this process simultaneously engage the attention of both pilots during flight.  (T-3) 11.5.6.  Approaching Coast-Out.  Prior to coast-out and outside of RNP RNAV airspace it is permissible and recommended to use the EGI or GPS (INAV source in AUTO mode) as the INAV  solution  for  both  CNI-SP  if  NAVAID  are  available  for  monitoring.    Prior  to  losing NAVAID reception, the INAV solution that is not the controlling solution must be placed to INS.    (T-3)    This  ensures  there  is  constant  comparison  of  the  controlling  solution  to  an independent  INS  solution.    Beginning  at  the  coast-out  waypoint  and  continuing  through coast-in,  CNI-MU  bearing/range  between  INAV  solutions  should  be  recorded  at  each waypoint to provide a running record of INS drift relative to the controlling solution. 11.5.7.  IFF.    Reset  Mode  3A  code  to  2000,  30  minutes  after  entering  Category  I  airspace.  (T-3) 11.5.8.  MFP and MPC Procedures. 11.5.8.1.  After  takeoff,  record  the  takeoff  time  in  the  Actual  Time  of  Arrival  (ATA) block  of  the  departure  airfield  on  the  MFP.    (T-3)    As  soon  as  practical  after  takeoff, determine  a  revised  Estimated  Time  of  Arrival  (ETA)  for  each  line  of  the  MFP  using flight-planned leg times and the actual departure time.  (T-3) 11.5.8.2.  Prior  to  waypoint  transition,  check  the  MFP  magnetic  course  and  distance  to the next waypoint against the CNI-MU.  (T-3)  The courses should be within 2º and the distances should agree within approximately 2 nm.  Check and verify that the subsequent waypoint is properly programmed.  (T-3)  Update ETA to the next two waypoints.  (T-3) 11.5.8.3.  Overhead  the  waypoint,  confirm  the  ATA  and  determine  the  minutes ahead/behind  by  comparing  it  to  the  ETA.    (T-3)    Record  the  CNI-MU  bearing/range   140  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 between  INAV  solutions  to  provide  a  running  record  of  INS  drift  relative  to  the controlling  solution.    (T-3)    Record  the  actual  fuel  remaining  above  the  flight-planned continuation  fuel  and  write  the  difference  between  continuation  fuel  and  actual  fuel remaining in the EXCESS block of the MPF.  (T-3)  See the in-flight fuel management section of Chapter 12 for additional guidance and definitions. 11.5.8.4.  Immediately after waypoint passage, and as soon as the aircraft has intercepted its new course, confirm that the aircraft is outbound on its flight planned magnetic course to the next waypoint and record the bearing/range between INAV solutions found on the INAV 1/3 page.  (T-3) 11.5.8.5.  Record the actual in-flight conditions (altitude, wind, and static air temperature (SAT)) above the forecast  conditions  on the next line of the MFP.  (T-3)  Update these conditions as well as fuel flow as needed on the PERF CRUISE and LEGS pages in the CNI-MU.  (T-3) 11.5.8.6.  If required, complete a position report to the controlling agency in accordance with FIH procedures.  The layout of the CNI PROGRESS page supports the format of the position  report;  however,  ensure  that  ETAs  passed  to  the  controlling  agency  match  the ETAs on the MFP.  (T-3)  This will enable the pilots to determine if an ETA has changed from what was previously reported.  If an ETA changes by more than 3 minutes, notify the controlling agency. 11.5.8.7.  Draw a diagonal line through the waypoint on the MFP to indicate it has been passed,  reported,  and  all  applicable  annotations  associated  with  waypoint  passage  have been completed.  (T-3) 11.5.8.8.  Approximately  60  nm  (10  to  15  minutes  depending  on  groundspeed)  after waypoint  passage,  MARK  the  aircraft  position  and  plot  the  INS-only  position  on  the MPC.  (T-3)  Record the mark time and position coordinates next to the plot.  (T-3)  If the plotted position is not within 2 nm of the course center-line, check waypoint coordinates for  accuracy,  ensure  the  autopilot  is  tracking  correctly  in  NAV  mode,  re-check  the accuracy of the charted course-line, and re-check that the position was plotted correctly.  (T-3) 11.5.8.9.  Cross  the  first  diagonal  on  the  MFP  to  indicate  that  the  aircraft  position  has been plotted.  (T-3) 11.5.8.10.  When the frequency of waypoints along CAT I route segments is greater than one every thirty minutes, full-line entries and plotting can be limited to a minimum of one every hour.  Full-line entries with the corresponding position plot are required for every waypoint involving a change of heading over 20°.  (T-3) 11.5.9.  Routine Monitoring. 11.5.9.1.  Because  of the altitude/steering modes, regular checks of correct engagement with the navigation system should be made. the  autopilot  disconnecting  from the  possibility  of 11.5.9.2.  Crews  should  monitor  aircraft  performance  and  outside  parameters,  suspect potential problem areas, and review the performance manual if the following conditions are encountered: AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   141  11.5.9.2.1.  The fuel remaining is less that the planned continuation fuel. 11.5.9.2.2.  Any Low Calculated Fuel CNI-MU advisory. 11.5.9.2.3.  ATA at any MFP fix is off by more than ± 5 minutes. 11.5.9.2.4.  SAT differs by more than ± 5º C from flight planned. 11.5.9.2.5.  Actual winds differ by more than 30º or 15 knots from flight-planned. 11.5.9.2.6.  Any Ahead/Behind Time more than 10% of total planned en route time to that point. 11.5.9.2.7.  Hazardous meteorological conditions. 11.5.10.  Approaching  Landfall.   Use the  radar to help  identify the  coast-in  position.  (T-3)  When the aircraft is approaching the first landfall NAVAID, tune and identify the navigation facility and crosscheck the aircraft position.  (T-3)  If coast-in is made at a radial/DME fix, the  appropriate  radial  should  be  selected  on  the  non-active  CDI  as  a  further  check  that  the navigation system is tracking according to the current clearance.  Once NAVAID reception is assured and flight is not being conducted in RNP RNAV airspace, all INAV solutions can be returned  to  AUTO.    If  entering  BRNAV  airspace,  AUTOTUNE  the  NAVAIDS,  select INS/RAD  as  the  controlling  solution,  and  place  the  other  INAV  solution  in  AUTO.    (T-3)  Revert to CAT II procedures.  (T-3)  Reset POS ALERT and IFF Mode 3 as appropriate.  (T-3) 11.6.  Special Certification Airspace Requirements and Procedures. 11.6.1.  The  GPS  currently  installed  in  the  C-130J  navigation  suite  does  not  meet  FAA certification requirements for IFR navigation.  AFI 11-202, Vol 3, allows the GPS to be used as a mission enhancement system for en route instrument navigation, if it is used to update a self-contained navigation system, such  as  INS  or  mission computer, and is checked  against other approved sources (in this case an RNP-10 certified INS).  Therefore, on CAT II routes (not  including  operations  in  BRNAV  airspace),  the  EGI  or  GPS  can  be  used  as  the controlling  solution  for  en  route  instrument  navigation  if  NAVAIDs  are  available  for monitoring.  The NAVAIDs must be operational and actively monitored.  (T-3)  If deviations are observed, crews should revert to navigation via ground based NAVAIDs.  For operations over  CAT  I  routes  (not  including  operations  in  RNP-10  airspace),  the  EGI  or  GPS  can  be used  as  the  controlling  solution  providing  the  pilot  can  monitor  its  performance  using  the offside  INS  as  an  independent  navigation  source.    The  EGI  or  GPS  cannot  be  used  as  the controlling solution in BRNAV or RNP-10 airspace, even when using INS as the sole input source for the EGI. 11.6.2.  The C-130J is certified for RNP-10 and Basic RNAV (BRNAV)/RNP-5 airspace, but with operational time restrictions.  These certifications are based on raw INS data. 11.6.2.1.  RNP-10  airspace  requires  a  track  keeping  accuracy  of  10  nm  for  95%  of  the flight.    The  track  containment  limit  is  20  nm.    The  C-130J  navigation  system  has  been certified to meet the requirements of RNP-10 airspace for up to 10 hours from the time the  controlling  INS  was  commanded  to  the  NAV  mode.    The  pure  INS  solution  is  the only  certified  navigation  solution  for  flying  in  this  airspace.    Annotate  the  letter―R  in Block 10 of the DD Form 1801 or appropriate block of the ICAO flight plan to indicate RNP-10 certification.   142  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 11.6.2.2.  BRNAV/RNP-5 airspace requires a track keeping accuracy of 5 nm for 95% of the flight.  The track containment limit is 10 nm.  Minimum equipment to operate in this airspace is one INS capable of updates.  The INS/RAD or INS-only solution will be the controlling INAV solution in this airspace.  The INS/RAD solution can be used without time  restrictions  if  the  solution  is  being  updated  from  NAVAIDs.    If  the  NAVAIDs become unreliable, either through radio failure or denial, the INS-only solution will still maintain  BRNAV  accuracy  for  2.6  hours  from  the  time  the  controlling  INS  was commanded to the NAV mode.  If needed, an in-flight alignment may be used to restart the  time-in-NAV  of  an  INS  prior  to  entry  into  this  airspace.    INS/RAD  or  INS-only solution will be selected prior to entering BRNAV airspace.  The AUTOTUNE function of the CNI-MS must be enabled.  (T-3)  BRNAV airspace currently exists throughout the European  Region.    Because  BRNAV  airspace  exists  only  where  NAVAID  reception  is available, CAT I procedures are not required.  Annotate the letter―R in Block 10 of the DD  Form  1801  or  appropriate  block  of  the  ICAO  flight  plan  to  indicate  BRNAV certification. 11.6.3.  Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum Airspace.  Airspace where RVSM is applied is considered special qualification airspace.  Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas.  (T-3)  Pilots will refer to FLIP AP/2 and the following for RVSM requirements: 11.6.3.1.  Both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and the transponder, must be fully operational.  (T-3)  The AC will request a new clearance to avoid this airspace should any of this equipment fail.  (T-3) 11.6.3.2.  Have  the  autopilot  engaged  during  level  cruise,  except  when  circumstances such as the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.  (T-3) 11.6.3.3.  Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out.  (T-3)  Record readings of both altimeters.  (T-3) 11.6.3.4.  Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.  (T-3) 11.6.3.5.  Limit  climb  and  descent  rates  to  1,000  feet  per  minute  when  operating  near other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.  (T-3) 11.6.3.6.  Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.  (T-3) 11.6.3.7.  Document  in  the  aircraft  forms  malfunctions  or  failures  of  RVSM  required equipment.  (T-3) 11.7.  Navigation Malfunctions and Failures. 11.7.1.  Should INAV solutions noticeably separate and exceed 8 nm, determine and use the INS  solution  considered  most  accurate  by  evaluating  both  INS  using  available  radio  aids, ground mapping radar, and GPS.  Highest validity should be given to positions referenced via radar.  Next highest validity should be given to positions derived via radio aid fixing.  When left  to  determine  most  probable  position  (MPP)  via  navigation  solution  comparisons,  two agreeing INS positions are more valid than two agreeing GPSs; and two agreeing GPSs and one agreeing INS indicate a probable INS problem.  Consider INS-radar/NAVAID, INS-INS, AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   143  and  INS-GPS  position  comparisons  that  are  less  than  4  nm  difference  to  be  valid  and  in agreement.   Once the most accurate  INS  is  determined, select it as the controlling solution.  Update ETAs to ATC if required. 11.7.2.  Situations  may  arise  when  crews  cannot  identify  the  faulty  navigation  system  by simple  comparison  of  positions  between  navigation  solutions.    Fly  the  aircraft  halfway between  the  disagreeing  INS  solutions.    Plot  both  CNI-SP  solutions  at  least  once  every  30 minutes on the MPC, labeling the pilot CNI-SP navigation solution MPP1 and the co-pilot’s MPP2.    Continue  to  evaluate  outputs  from  each  INS  and  try  to  use  plotted  position information to identify adverse trends. 11.7.3.  Malfunctions and failures in MNPS airspace: 11.7.3.1.  Crews  experiencing  deterioration  or  failure  of  navigation  equipment  that reduces  the  capability  to  comply  with  MNPS  prior  to  MNPS  entry  will  return  to  a suitable airfield with a maintenance repair facility. 11.7.3.2.  Crews experiencing deterioration or failure of navigation equipment after entry into MNPS airspace should immediately report the malfunction to the controlling agency and  subsequent  agencies  throughout  the  route  of  flight.    Once  the  aircraft  has  entered oceanic  airspace, the PIC should continue to  operate the aircraft in  accordance with  the Oceanic  Clearance  already  received,  appreciating  that  the  reliability  of  the  total navigation  system  has  been  significantly  reduced.    The  PIC  should  also  prepare  a proposal to ATC with respect to the prevailing circumstances and consult with ATC as to the most suitable action. 11.7.3.3.  If an aircraft in MNPS airspace is unable to continue flight in accordance with its ATC clearance for reasons such as severe turbulence, aircraft performance problems, or pressurization failure, a revised clearance should  be obtained  as soon  as possible.   If unable  to  obtain  a  new  clearance,  offset  30  nm  from  the  assigned  route  by  turning  90° from track and maintain altitude if possible.  Once offset 30 nm, climb or descend to an altitude which differs from those normally used by 500 ft. 11.7.4.  Malfunctions and failures in RNP-10 or BRNAV airspace: 11.7.4.1.  Aircraft unable to maintain RNP-10 or BRNAV RNAV tolerances must advise controlling agency immediately and take appropriate coordinated action.   144  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Figure 11.1.

A  fuel  plan  is  required  for  all  flights  except  local  area  flights  with  established standard  fuel  loads.    (T-3)    The  Computer  Flight  Planning  Software  (CFPS)  Computer  Flight Plan (CFP) and TO 1C-130J-1-1 are the primary method of fuel planning.  All preflight planning must  be  verified  with  aircraft  MC  performance  prior  to  departure.    (T-3)    Missions  should  be planned at altitudes, routes, and airspeeds to minimize fuel usage. 12.1.1.  EC-130J Management.  All EC-130J flight operations will use fuel planning and en route fuel management procedures.  (T-3) 12.1.2.  Forms.  This chapter contains instructions for completion of the fuel planning and in-flight fuel management sections of the AF Form  4138,  EC-130 Flight Plan and Navigation Log,  AF  Form  4139,  Special  Operations  C-130  CS  In-Flight  Refueling  Worksheet,  and  AF Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log.  CFP forms may be used in lieu of fuel planning portion of the AF Form 4138 or AF Form 70; using formats approved by the unit Stan/Eval. 12.1.3.  CFPS.    The  CSO  and/or  pilots  will  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  CFP  and  should complete  an  AF  Form  4138,  AF  Form  4139,  or  AF  Form  70  to  verify  all  fuel  and  reserve requirements prior to flight.  (T-3)  Calculate cruise fuel using Range Summary data.  (T-3)  Note:    The  flight  planning  computer  configuration  is  approved  by  AFSOC  and  the  Special Operations  Mission  Planning  Office.    Uncertified,  untested,  or  beta  versions  of  developing software will not be used for actual mission planning.  (T-2)   (T-3) 12.1.4.  Overhead Requirements.  Crews will always flight plan to overhead destination at the final  en  route  cruise  altitude.   Unless  specified  otherwise,  overhead  the destination/AAR  abort  airfield  is  defined  as  a  terminal  NAVAID/fix  within  25  nm  of  or overhead the destination/AAR abort airfield.  For fuel planning purposes, this will preclude adding  approach  fuel  when  an  en  route  descent  is  planned  and  flown.    When  planning  to initiate  a  complete  approach  from  overhead  destination  at  cruise  altitude,  a  700-pound approach  fuel  entry  is  required  per  Figure  12.1,  AF  Form  4138  and  AF  Form  4139,  Fuel Load Components. 12.1.5.  ATC  Cruise  Ceiling.    Use  TO  1-C-130J-1-1,  4  engine,  normal  bleed  ATC  Cruise Ceiling  charts  to  determine  the  cruise  altitude  ceiling  for  computer-generated  flight  plans.  Note:    Use  initial  ATC  cruise  ceiling  for  the  en  route  altitude  unless  restricted  by  fuel freezing limitations.  (T-3)  See TO 1C-130(E)J-1 for fuel temperature freezing limitations. 12.1.6.  Fuel Reserves.  Calculate fuel reserves IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3, using Terminal Fuel Flow (TFF). 12.1.7.  Planning Factors. 12.1.7.1.  Use  fuel  planning  factors  as  outlined  in  Figure  12.1,  AF  Form  4138  and  AF Form 4139, Fuel Load Components, to calculate and/or verify fuel loads. 12.1.7.2.  Wing  Relieving  Fuel.    Additional  fuel  kept  in  the  main  tanks  intended  to counter  wing  bending  moments  and  keep  the  aircraft  within  flight  manual  weight limitations.   152  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 12.1.7.2.1.  Calculate Wing Relieving Fuel using the flight manual weight limitations chart  for  the  aircraft‘s  planned  cargo  load.    (T-3)    Enter  the  chart  with  the  aircraft empty weight and cargo weight, and then read across to determine the fuel required to remain  within  limits.    Add  enough  Wing  Relieving  Fuel,  if  required,  to  ensure  that Recovery Fuel does not fall below the fuel required to remain within limits. 12.1.7.2.2.  All missions flying low-level will initially takeoff with main tanks full to reduce the effects of wing up-bending and increase the center wing box service life.  (T-3)    Reduced  takeoff  fuel  in  the  main  tanks  can  decrease  the  center  wing  box service life as much as 47%. 12.2.  Alternate and In-Flight Refueling Abort Fuel Planning. 12.2.1.  Destination Alternate Selection and Fuel Planning Requirements.  When an alternate is required, EC-130J aircrews will plan to be overhead the destination airfield with sufficient fuel to proceed to the furthest alternate, hold at the alternate accomplish a descent/approach and land with a minimum of 4,000 pounds.  (T-3)  Note:  Ensure alternates are entered on the last en route cruise line prior to your destination.  (T-2) 12.2.1.1.  When  only  one  alternate  is  required,  use  the  closest  suitable  airfield  meeting mission requirements (such as special requirements for hazmat or patients) and AFI 11-202, Vol 3, weather criteria. 12.2.1.2.  If two alternates are required, use the two closest suitable airfields meeting AFI 11202, Vol 3, weather criteria and fuel plan to the more distant of the two. 12.2.1.3.  When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields are preferred if within 75 nm of destination. 12.2.2.  In-Flight  Refueling  Abort  Base  Fuel  Planning  Requirements.    All  route  segments, which  include  an  in-flight  refueling,  should  be  planned  with  sufficient  fuel  onboard  to  fly from the departure airfield or previous End Air Refueling point (EAR) to an EAR point, and if  required,  divert  so  as  to  arrive  overhead  the  abort  airfield  with  sufficient  fuel  to  hold, accomplish  a  descent/approach  and  land  with  a  minimum  of  4,000  pounds  of  fuel  (IAW Figure  12.1,  AF  Form  4138  and  AF  Form  4139,  Fuel  Load  Components,  requirements) without receiving an on-load.  Note:  Air refueling divert entries and fuel on-loads should be entered in the EAR waypoint line. 12.2.3.  Destination Alternate or In-Flight Refueling Abort Planning Factors.  Normally, the destination  alternate  or  in-flight  refueling  abort  profile  is  based  on  direct  routing  at  260 KTAS at 10,000 feet for alternates within 200 nm of the destination airfield/EAR point, and FL  210  or  FL  220  at  Long  Range  Cruise  (LRC)  speed  for  alternates  beyond  200  nm.  Calculate alternate/abort fuel by using the divert (DVT) feature of CFPS.  (T-3)  The divert fuel  will  not  be  calculated  into  the  fuel  plan,  but  will  be  printed  on  the  CFP  with  the calculated fuel required.  (T3) 12.2.3.1.  Identified extra fuel will be added for the following:  (T-3) 12.2.3.1.1.  When fuel availability is limited or not available at en route stops. 12.2.3.1.2.  For known holding delays in excess of standard. 12.2.3.1.3.  For anticipated off course weather avoidance or air traffic control vectors. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   153  12.2.3.1.4.  Known or forecast icing. 12.2.3.1.5.  Insufficient NAVAIDS at destination. 12.2.3.1.6.  Pressurization loss with passengers onboard. 12.3.  Computer  Flight  Planned  Fuel  Analysis.  AF  Form  4138  fuel  analysis  blocks  may  be reproduced in the computer flight plan printed format.  Additionally, AF Form 4138, AF Form 4139, and AF Form 70 fuel analysis may be accomplished using en route fuel and terminal fuel flow  data  derived  from  computer  generated  flight  plans.    Note:    When  fuel  analysis  is accomplished using a computer flight planning system, use the fuel flow from the last applicable route  segment  for  calculations  requiring  a  terminal  fuel  flow  value  as  outlined  in  Figure  12.1, AF Form 4138 and AF Form 4139, Fuel Load Components. 12.3.1.  Computer  generated  fuel  planning.    With  the  exception  of  those  items  explained  in this  paragraph,  all  items  required  for  computer  generated  fuel  analysis  are  explained  in  the Fuel Load Components chart as outlined in Figure 12.1, AF Form 4138 and AF Form 4139, Fuel Load Components. 12.3.1.1.  Cruise  profiles.    To  ensure  the  accuracy  of  computer  generated  fuel  analysis, CFPs  must  include  accurate  route,  altitude,  airspeed,  wind,  temperature  deviation,  drag index, fuel load and aircraft gross weight information.  (T-3) 12.3.1.2.

When the mission does not include in-flight refueling, crews will perform fuel  analysis  using  the  top  portion  of  the  approved  CFPS  Flight  and  Fuel  Plan  (without  AAR) (193  SOW  Form  4138).    When  an  in-flight  refueling  (single  or  double  A/R)  is  planned,  crews will  use  the  AF  Form  4139  in  conjunction  with  the  approved  CFPS  Flight  and  Fuel  Plan  (193 SOW SINGLE/DOUBLE A/R Form 4138) to perform the fuel analysis.  With the exception of those items explained in this chapter, all items required for computer generated Form 4138 fuel analysis are explained in the Fuel Load Components chart as outlined in Figure 12.1, AF Form 4138 and AF Form 4139, Fuel Load Components. 12.5.  Fuel  Analysis  (without  AAR)  (193  SOW  4138).  See  Figure  12.2 and  Figure 12.3, for an example of a CFPS Flight and Fuel Analysis (without AAR) (193 SOW 4138) from CYYT to EGUN. 12.5.1.

Note:  If 10% of your total flight time exceeds 45 minutes  (i.e.,  48  minutes),  use  45  minutes.    If  10%  of  your  total  flight  time  is  less  than  20 minutes (i.e., 15 minutes), use 20 minutes. 12.5.3.  ALTERNATE (Block 3).  Plan alternate fuel using CFPS generated fuel data for the desired altitude and airspeed profile or calculate using TFF procedures. 12.5.4.  APPROACH  (Block  4).    Normally  enter  0.0  lbs  when  an  en  route  descent  will  be accomplished at the destination.  When planning to accomplish an approach from overhead destination at a cruise or intermediate altitude, a 700-pound approach fuel entry is required.  Refer to Paragraph 12.1.5 for additional information.  Note:  The Approach (APCH) feature in  CFPS  will  be  used  to  enter  the  required  holding  fuel  (2,000  or  3,500  lbs)  on  the  final destination line of the CFPS flight plan; not for entering the approach fuel (0.0 or 700 lbs). 12.5.5.

This  volume  establishes  procedures  for  AFSOC  Direct  Support  Operator(s) (DSO)  for  employment  of  EC-130J  aircraft.    In  addition  to  the  duties  listed  in  applicable technical  orders,  directives,  and  this  instruction,  the  PIC  may  assign  other  duties  as  necessary.  The DSO is primarily responsible for providing inputs to enhance aircrew situational awareness.  Refer to AFSOCI 11-2DSO, Vol 1-3. 16.2.  Mission Planning Factors. 16.2.1.  Mission Planning.  Detailed information on mission planning can be found in AFTTP 31.General  Planning  (S).    General  Planning  and  Employment  Considerations,  AFTTP 31.Threat  Guide  (S).    Threat  Reference  Guide  and  Considerations,  AFTTP  3-1.E/MC130J, Tactical  Employment  E/MC-130J  (S)    and  AFTTP  3-3.E/MC-130J,  Combat  Aircraft Fundamentals E/MC-130J (U). 16.2.2.  The  DSO,  after  coordinating  with  the  supporting  analyst  and  other  appropriate agencies,  will  conduct  mission  planning  with  the  aircrew  of  all  combat  mission  scenarios.  (T-3)  The DSO will brief expected scenario inputs based on the analytical data, as required.  (T-3) 16.2.3.  The  DSO  is  responsible  for  coordinating  with  all  appropriate  agencies  to  obtain  all required or anticipated mission planning, professional, and SILENT Shield equipment for the duration of the flight/deployment.  (T-3)  The DSO will ensure all equipment is inventoried and inspected prior to flight/deployment.  (T-3) 16.3.  Preflight/In-Flight Responsibilities.  The DSO will:  (T-3) 16.3.1.  Brief  the  crew  on  the  Joint  Threat  Warning  System  (JTWS)  configuration  and anticipated inputs.  (T-3) 16.3.2.  Ensure the crew is aware of JTWS capabilities and limitations, as well as operational security considerations.  (T-3) 16.3.3.  Monitor  situational  awareness  information  and  relay  pertinent  information  to  the crew.  (T-3) 16.3.4.  Advise the crew of any change in the status of mission equipment.  (T-3) 16.3.5.  The  DSO  is  responsible  for  knowing  approximate  aircraft  location,  altitude,  and intentions at all times.  (T-3) 16.4.  Communications  Procedures.  When  missions  require  the  DSO  to  communicate,  they will obtain proper frequencies, time hack, schedules, and call signs prior to flight.  Depending on the nature of the mission and the communications, the DSO will keep the crew updated on any pertinent information and will coordinate with the PIC for authorization to transmit.  (T-3)  On EC130J  aircraft,  the  DSO  will  coordinate  with  the  crew  during  mission  planning  regarding interphone connectivity.  (T-3) 16.5.  Post Mission.  In addition to appropriate debriefs, the DSO will also ensure:  (T-3)   186  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 16.5.1.  Equipment write-ups are passed on to maintenance.  (T-3) 16.5.2.  Post mission Technical Summary inputs are provided to the supporting analyst.  (T-3) 16.5.3.  Provide information to their units summarizing mission events, as required.  (T-3) 16.6.  Augmentation.  Some contingency operations may require operators from other units, or in some cases, non-aircrew personnel to provide tactical crypto logic support.  In these cases, a mission-ready  instructor-qualified  DSO  will  fly  as  primary  DSO,  and  be  responsible  for  DSO inputs. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   187  Chapter 17 TACTICAL EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURES 17.1.  General.  This chapter describes the specific equipment requirements, training restrictions, and  regulatory  guidance  for  employment  procedures  for  the  EC-130J.    It  is  not  a  stand-alone reference  and  should  be  used  in  conjunction  with  AFTTP  3-3.E/MC-130J.

If aircraft do not possess the minimum equipment listed, they are restricted to flying MSA. 2.  Either Map or Mono-Pulse Ground Mode (MGM) mode must be operational. 3.  If the Low Power Color Radar (APN-241) is inoperable, crews may fly NVG LL (VMC) over flat and rolling (non-mountainous) terrain. 4.  Operable  Low Power Color Radar (APN-241) not required with EGI FOM 2 or better. 5.  Minimum of 1 x EGI navigation solution required for mission computer-directed airdrops (FOM 4 or greater requires an update). 17.7.  Mission Planning.  All pilots and CSOs will conduct a route study prior to any low-level operations.  (T-3)  The route study will emphasize NVG limitations and performance factors and their impact on terrain and obstacle clearance.  (T-3) 17.7.1.  En  Route  Planning.    Crews  should  fly  tactical  missions  at  the  highest  altitude commensurate  with  the  threat(s)  environment.    During  training,  greater  weather  or  altitude minimums may be dictated by FLIP, ICAO procedures, or training considerations. 17.7.2.  Mountainous terrain is defined in AFI 11-202, Vol 3. 17.7.3.  Threat  analysis.    Refer  to  AFTTP  3-1,  General  Planning  and  AFTTP  3-1,    Threat Guide for in-depth information of threat system capabilities and limitations, as well as threat employment techniques. 17.7.4.  Mission employment.  Refer to AFTTP 3-1/3 E/MC-130J for detailed information on EC130J tactical techniques and procedures. 17.7.5.  Chart requirements.  Planned low-level routes will be drawn on a 1:500,000 (TPC) or larger scale chart.  (T-3)  Use a 1:250,000 (JOG) or larger scale chart for the objective area, unless not available or of an inferior quality to a TPC.  (T-3)  Every effort must be made to minimize  chart  clutter.    If  electronic  charts  are  used,  a  backup  paper  chart,  prepared  IAW chart  requirements,  must  be  immediately  available  for  each  crew  member  using  electronic charts.  (T3)             WARNING:  Aeronautical charts do not depict man-made obstacles less than  200  feet  AGL  or  a  change  in  terrain  until  it  exceeds  the  chart  contour  interval.    The worst situation would occur if a 199-foot tower sat on terrain with an elevation just below the next higher contour.  For a 1:500,000 (TPC) with a contour interval of 500 feet, this results in an uncharted obstacle existing 698 feet above charted terrain.  Additionally, the highest spot elevation on  any  given leg may not be the highest  terrain  as in  the case  of  gradually  rising elevations.  Planners must ensure accurate terrain analysis evaluates both spot elevations and the  highest  contour  level.    (T-3)                      CAUTION:    Some  charts  may  depict  terrain  and obstacle  altitudes  in  meters  versus  feet  (e.g.,  JOG  and  TLM  charts  in  some  areas  of  the world).      Note:  If an NVG route (any terrain condition) has been planned using a JOG and elevations and altitudes are verified, the route may be flown with reference to a TPC.   190  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Figure 17.1.  Inherent Chart Error.  17.7.5.1.  Color  copies  and  laminated  charts  are  acceptable  provided  the  contour  and contrast  remain  intact  and  the  chart  is  used  for  preflight  route  study  and  the  flight.    If laminated  charts  are  used,  the  crew  will  ensure  that  the  laminate  does  not  degrade  the quality or readability of the chart and that all data remains intact.  (T-3) 17.7.5.2.  The chart series, scale, and edition will be annotated on the chart.  (T-3)  The current Chart Updating Manual (CHUM) review date will also be annotated on the chart.  (T-3) 17.7.5.3.  Place the emergency safe altitude (ESA) in  bold numbers on the chart.   (T-3)  When multiple ESAs are used, or when strip charts are used, the ESA will be annotated on  each  chart  segment.    (T-3)    Place  a  double  box  around  the  obstacle  or  terrain  that defines each ESA.  (T-3) 17.7.5.4.  For each leg, place a box around the obstacle or terrain that defines the MSA. MSA, magnetic course, and leg distance will be annotated on the chart for each leg.   (T-3) 17.7.5.5.  Operational Advisory Arrows are optional on pilot charts. 17.7.5.6.  When transitioning from one chart to another, allow a sufficient route overlap. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   191  17.7.5.7.  The pilot  and  copilot  may  share a single low-level chart during flight.    If this option  is  used,  both  the  pilot  and  copilot  must  participate  in  pre-mission  route  analysis using the single chart.  (T-3) 17.7.5.8.  Order  of  Battle.    In  an  exercise  or  actual  combat  situation,  it  is  required  to depict  threat  information  directly  on  the  navigational  route  chart.    (T-3)    Inclusion  of threat  capabilities  may  classify  the  chart.    Note:    Classify  charts  depending  on information sources and methods used to obtain this data (required only if classification is Confidential or higher). 17.7.5.9.  Start  climb  points  will  be  computed  during  planning,  annotated  on  all  charts, and briefed during route study for all significant climbs when there is a terrain differential of 1,500 feet or greater over 3 nm or less.  (T-3)  Operating at high density altitudes may yield  even  less  performance.    Assume  the  aircraft  will  be  at  the  lowest  possible  point within the corridor and compute climbs from there. 17.8.  Preparation for NVG Operations. 17.8.1.  Required Equipment.  (T-3) 17.8.1.1.  NVGs.    Each  crew  member  will  preflight  their  NVGs  prior  to  flight.    (T-3)  Due  to  the  HUD  illumination,  F4949G-series  or  newer  generation  NVGs  are  required.  (T-3)  The PIC must ensure there is one spare set of pre-flighted NVGs.  (T-3)  When the mission requires the loadmasters to use NVGs, a spare set will be available for their use.  (T-3) 17.8.1.1.1.  Required  NVG  Visual  Acuity.    Aircrew  will  use  an  approved  testing device.  (T-3)  The Hoffman ANV-20/20 tester minimum visual acuity for high-light resolution is 20/30, low-light is 20/35.  (T-3)  If prescribed acuity is not obtained, the NVGs  must  be  verified  by  AFE  personnel.    (T-3)    If  the  NVGs  pass,  they  are acceptable for flight. 17.8.1.2.  NVG  Compatible  Light  Source.    Each  crew  member  must  ensure  they  have  a NVG compatible light source.  (T-3) 17.8.1.3.  Ensure exterior lights are set IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3. 17.8.1.4.  Aircraft black out kit.  (T-3) 17.9.  Low-Level  Operations.  WARNING:    The  CSO  or  PM  must  continually  keep  the  PF apprised  of  flight  progress  and  anticipated  terrain  elevations,  obstructions,  climb  points,  and descent points.  (T-3) 17.9.1.  Emergency  Safe  Altitude.    ESA  is  an  altitude  that  will  provide  positive  terrain clearance in IMC during situations that require the exiting of the low-level environment.  To compute ESA, add 1,000 feet  (2,000 feet  in  mountainous terrain) to  the  highest  obstacle or terrain feature within 10 nm of route centerline or intended flight path (whichever is greater), rounded to the next 100-foot increment.  (T-3)  Use of area ESAs is recommended whenever possible;  however,  a  single  ESA  is  sufficient  when  there  are  no  significant  changes  in topography.  ESA will be annotated on all flight charts.  (T-3) 17.9.2.  Minimum  Safe  Altitude  (MSA).    MSA  is  an  initial  VFR  altitude  that  provides additional  terrain  and  obstacle  clearance  while  the  aircrew  analyzes  situations  that  require   192  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 interruption  of  low-level  operations  (route  disorientation  and  equipment  malfunctions  or when  either  pilot  must  leave  the  seat  during  low-level  operations,  etc.).    Plan  MSA  at  an indicated  altitude  of  500  feet  above  the  highest  obstruction  to  flight  (man-made  obstacle, terrain  feature,  or  spot  elevation),  or  400  feet  plus  one  chart  contour  interval  above  the highest  depicted  terrain  contour,  whichever  is  highest,  within  3  nm  of  route  centerline  to include turn radius.  (T-3)  An MSA will be computed for each leg, route segment, or entire low-level route.  (T-3)  See Figure 17.2. 17.9.3.  Route Planning.  Low-level flights will be planned using tactical corridors.  Tactical corridors should be planned as wide as possible, to provide maximum situational awareness and flexibility.  The standard width  for  a tactical corridor is  3 nm.   Tactical  corridor width can vary from 1 nm minimum either side of centerline, to as wide as desired (10 nm either side  is  the  max  recommended).    Corridors  do  not  have  to  be  symmetrical,  but  must  be annotated  when  different  from  the  standard.    (T-3)    As  a  rule  of  thumb,  tactical  corridors should be wide over flat terrain and narrow in mountainous terrain. Figure 17.2.  Minimum Safe Altitude.  17.9.4.  Low-Level Weather Requirements.  In accordance with AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  During training  operations,  higher  weather  or  altitude  minimums  may  be  dictated  by  FLIP,  ICAO procedures,  or  training  considerations.    Higher  minimum  visibility  may  be  required  to identify and clear obstacles. 17.9.5.  Missions  planned  when  the  lunar  illumination  is  forecast  to  be  less  than  .8 millilux/10%  effective  illumination  during  the  mission  require  an  additional  level  of  ORM.  (T-3)    The  squadron  CC/DO  or  designated  representative  will  be  made  aware  of  the  ORM AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   193  assessment  and  risk  mitigation  conducted  for  missions  planned  to  be  flown  in  low illumination conditions.  (T3) 17.9.6.  Low-Level Altitudes. 17.9.6.1.  Day  VMC  Low-Level  Altitude.    Fly  no  lower  than  300  feet  AGL  modified contour altitude above the terrain using visual references and radar altimeter.  (T-3) 17.9.6.1.1.  In  addition  to  restrictions  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  specific  country  or theater of operations publications, and FLIP area planning, routes will not be planned or flown below 500 feet AGL unless:  host nation rules specifically allow such VFR operations, routes or training areas have been environmentally assessed and surveyed for 300-foot AGL operations.  Note:  This restriction does not apply to one-time-use routes.    Consult  FLIP  AP/1B  for  published  Military  Training  Route  (MTR) restrictions. 17.9.6.2.  NVG  Low-Level  Altitude.    The  minimum  altitude  is  300  foot  AGL  (non-mountainous) and 500 foot AGL (mountainous terrain).  (T-2)  Higher altitudes should be flown if terrain-masked. 17.9.6.3.  Non-NVG  Low-Level  Altitude.    Fly  no  lower  than  Minimum  Safe  Altitude.  (T-2)  Fly with reference to the pressure altimeter, using the radar altimeter as a backup. 17.9.6.4.  Man-Made  Obstacles.    All  man-made  obstacles  must  be  avoided  by  1  nm laterally, or 500 feet vertically, unless visually identified.  (T-3)  This applies for both day and  night  flights,  and  also  includes  obstacles  outside  of  the  planned  tactical  corridor.  Note:  If the planned altitude for a leg is more than 500 feet above a man-made obstacle, this obstacle is not a factor.  When flying at 500 feet AGL or below, all obstacles are a factor. 17.9.6.5.  IMC  Low-Level  Altitude.    Fly  no  lower  than  1,000  feet  (2,000  feet  in mountainous  terrain)  above  the  highest  obstruction  to  flight  (man-made  obstruction, terrain  feature,  or  spot  elevation)  within  5  nm  of  route  centerline.    (T-2)    Round  this altitude to the next 100-foot increment. 17.9.6.5.1.  Minimum  altitudes  for  IFR  operations  within  published  MTRs  in  US sovereign airspace will be the computed leg MSA unless a higher altitude is required by FLIP AP/1B. 17.9.6.5.2.  Flying portions of planned flights in IMC may be necessary to accomplish mission  objectives;  however,  due  to  aircraft  equipment  limitations,  operational employment in a low-level environment should be considered a last resort.  The PIC and  CSO  must  consider  the  terrain  and  the  accuracy  of  the  altimeter  setting  before IMC profiles are attempted.  (T-3) 17.9.7.  Climb to MSA when either pilot must leave the seat or loses NVGs during low-level flight.  (T-3)  Exception:  If performing a planned seat swap for training with an instructor pilot in the seat, climb to a safe altitude. 17.9.8.  Altimeter  settings.    Use  the  best  available  altimeter  setting.    (T-3)    It  is  vital  that aircrews accurately update all altimeters prior to  low-level/objective areas.  When a current local altimeter setting is not available, or a reliable altimeter update (ALT UPDATE) cannot be accomplished, use the lowest forecast altimeter setting.  (T-3)   194  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 17.9.8.1.  An  ALT  UPDATE  derived  aircraft  altimeter  setting  should  only  be  used outside ATC controlled environments.  An ALT UPDATE should be performed prior to all airdrops or landings.  Obtain an ALT UPDATE as close to the objective area and as near  the  objective  altitude  as  possible.    Use  sound  judgment  when  updating  aircraft altimeters and cross-check elevations and new settings with all available information. 17.9.8.1.1.  If a valid GPS position is available (FOM 2 or better), the PM will update the  aircraft  altimeter  setting  to  equal  the  GPS  altitude  once  established  on  drop altitude (for airdrops) or the final ingress altitude (for SCA).  (T-3)  For SCA ingress altitudes  greater  than  1,000  above  the  threshold  elevation,  use  the  forecasted  lowest altimeter setting.  (T-3) 17.9.8.1.2.  If  a  valid  GPS  altitude  is  unavailable  (FOM  3  or  greater),  the  CSO  will update the pressure altimeter by recording the current altimeter setting, AGL altitude from  the  radar  altimeter,  and  the  MSL  altitude  from  the  pressure  altimeter  over  a known elevation and  computing a new setting or use the minimum  altimeter setting for the objective area.  (T-3)  This works well when flying over a body of  water, or flat  terrain.    Ensure  that  the  radar  altimeter  is  fully  operational  and  use  sound judgment when updating aircraft altimeters.  (T-3)     WARNING:  Obtaining an ALT UPDATE  at  a  significantly  higher  or  lower  altitude  than  the  target  can  induce substantial altimeter error.  Use extreme caution when updating the pressure altimeter to a higher setting, as lower absolute altitudes will result.  (T-3) 17.9.8.1.3.  Apply  cold  weather  altimeter  corrections  to  any  non-GPS  derived barometric  altitude  (MSA,  ESA,  reference  altitude,  drop  altitude,  SCA  backup altitudes,  SCA  minimums,  etc.),  used  during  low-level  operations  when  the  outside air temperature is below 32o F/0o C.  (T-3) 17.10.  Low-Level Emergency Procedures. 17.10.1.  Crew  Disorientation.    Threat  permitting,  when  a  crew  becomes  disoriented  on  a low-level mission, start a climb to ESA.  (T-3)  Continue the climb until the ESA is reached or a positive fix is obtained.  (T-3)  After obtaining a positive fix, descend and resume low-level operations.  (T-3)  The CSO/PM will cross-check timing and adjust as necessary.  (T-3) 17.10.2.  Spatial  Disorientation.    The  PM  will  be  ready  to  immediately  take  control  of  the aircraft if the flying pilot  experiences spatial  disorientation.  (T-3)  Start a climb  to  at least MSA until the pilot experiencing the problem is ready to resume PF duties.  (T-3) 17.10.3.  Inoperative  NVGs.    In  the  event  of  an  NVG  malfunction,  start  a  climb  to  at  least MSA until the pilot experiencing the problem is ready to resume their duties.  (T-3) 17.10.4.  Aircraft  System  Failure.    Begin  a  climb  to  MSA  when  a  known  or  suspected malfunction prevents continued safe low-level operations.  (T-3) 17.10.5.  Emergency Climb.  Consider this procedure in cases of (but not limited to):  certain equipment  malfunctions,  spatial  disorientation,  inadvertent  weather  penetration,  critically low  aircraft  altitude  and/or  airspeed,  and/or  loss  of  situational  awareness  during  low-level operations.  Any crew member may initiate this procedure by stating “Emergency Climb.”  If required/called  for,  execute  the  procedure  as  soon  as  possible.    (T-3)    Table  17.2  lists  the steps for the Emergency Climb procedure. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   195  Table 17.2.  Emergency Climb Procedure  (T-3). 1.  Announce “emergency climb” to the crew over interphone. 2.  Execute the 1C-130(E)J-1 Wind Shear Procedures. 3.  Close ramp and door (if open). 4.    Turn  away  (with  consideration  for  stall  margin)  from  terrain  if  feasible.    If  not  possible, climb straight ahead for the maximum climb angle. 5.  The PM will monitor and call airspeed as appropriate.  Pilots must monitor stall caret. 6.  The CSO will state an MSA or ESA as appropriate, monitor terrain (via radar,  chart,  etc.) and “clear of terrain” when above all critical terrain. 7.  When clear of all terrain, adjust pitch, power, and airspeed for a normal climb out and level off. WARNING:  If impact with terrain is imminent, use 100% flaps, 10 knots above the stall caret and crash the aircraft straight ahead. 17.11.  Radar Altimeter Usage. 17.11.1.  Set  radar  altimeter  no  lower  than  20%  below  the  planned  en  route  altitude.    (T-3)  Depending on required altitude profile, illumination, and proficiency, a higher radar altimeter setting may be appropriate. 17.11.2.  The  PF  will  make  an  immediate  correction  any  time  the  system  provides  an “altitude” annunciation.  (T-3)  Note:  Regardless of the radar altimeter setting  you use, do not wait for an annunciation to begin a correction. 17.12.  Defensive Maneuvers and Equipment. 17.12.1.  Practice Combat Maneuvers.  All crew members will be pre-briefed and advised of the time period/portion of the flight when practice threat maneuvers will be executed.  (T-3)  Crew  coordination  is  essential  in  avoiding  injury  to  crew  members  during  practice  threat maneuvers. 17.12.2.  Expendables/ECM  Training.    Conduct  all  expendables  training  IAW  CJCSM 3212.02C,  Performing  Electronic  Attack  In  The  United  States  And  Canada  For  Tests, Training,  And  Exercises,  AFI  11214,  Air  Operations  Rules  and  Procedures,  AFI  10706, Electronic  Warfare  (EW)  Operations,  AFI  13212,  Range  Planning  and  Operations,  and applicable  host  nation  directives.    Dispense  only  when  approved  by  the  controlling  agency IAW  agency  procedures  and  restrictions.    When  over  open-water,  do  not  drop  expendables below  500  feet  AGL  or  within  3    nm  of  any  surface  vessel,  platform,  or  landmass.    (T-3)    WARNING:    Practicing  defensive  threat  maneuvering  does  not  constitute  authority  to deviate from limitations in the flight manual or this instruction. 17.13.  Degraded  Systems  Training  (DST).  DST  is  used  to  prepare  crews  to  accomplish  the mission  simulating  certain  pieces  of  equipment  inoperative  (or  intentionally  turned  off  for emission  control).    On  non-local  routes,  designate  leg  segments  during  the  route  brief.    (T-3)  The following restrictions and procedures are designed to maximize training and safety.  (T-3) 17.13.1.  Restrictions:  (T-3)   196  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 17.13.1.1.  Visibility must be 5 sm in mountainous terrain.  (T-3) 17.13.1.2.  One radar altimeter must be operational.  (T-3) 17.13.1.3.  Mission  instructor  or  evaluator  must  be  in  either  the  pilot  or  CSO  position.  (T-3) 17.13.1.4.  One  HDD  at  any  crew  position  must  be  selected  and  monitored  by  an instructor (P/CSO) for DST of the navigation system.  (T-3) 17.13.1.5.  PICs will brief the following items:  (T-3) 17.13.1.5.1.  Equipment simulated inoperative.  (T-3) 17.13.1.5.2.  Aircrew coordination.  (T-3) 17.13.1.5.3.  Disorientation and emergency procedures.  (T-3) 17.14.  Self-Contained Approach(s) (SCA). 17.14.1.  Planning. 17.14.1.1.  SCA  procedures  may  be  used  for  approaches  to  conventional  airfields  and assault zones, and for either overt or NVG airland operations.  Comply with local ATC restrictions and host nation agreements, as appropriate. 17.14.2.  En  Route  Altitude.    The  altitude  profile  may  consist  of  MSL  altitudes,  NVG altitudes, or any combination.  In all cases, an MSL altitude profile will be planned. 17.14.3.  Weather minimums. 17.14.3.1.  SCA  must  be  conducted  in  VMC  unless  HQ  MAJCOM/A3V  (or  delegated approval  authority)  approves  IMC  operations.    (T-2)    If  approved,  IMC  SCA  weather minimums will be no lower than 300 feet and 1.  (T2) 17.14.4.  Minimum  Descent  Altitude.    To  compute  MDA  for  VMC  operations,  add  a minimum of 100 feet to the Touchdown Zone Elevation (TDZE).  (T-3)  For approved IMC SCA operations, add a minimum of 300 feet to the TDZE.  (T-3) 17.14.5.  Missed Approach Point (MAP).  The MAP is at zero distance to go on the mission computer or as required for obstacle clearance on the SCA plate at MDA. 17.14.6.  A  full  SCA  Plate  for  landing  runway  is  required.    (T-2)    Construct  an  approach plate  for  the  landing  runway  using  the  AF  Form  4118,  Self-Contained  Approach  (SCA) Planning  Form,  computer  Approach  Planning  Tool  (APT),  or  an  OGV  approved  planning form. 17.14.7.  Approach Path and Glideslope Construction.  Plan IMC SCAs with a 3° glideslope from  en  route  altitude  unless  terrain  or  obstructions  dictate  a  different  glideslope.    (T-3)  Avoid  using  glideslopes  greater  than  5°.    (T-3)    Plan  initial  VMC  SCA  glideslopes commensurate  with  terrain,  obstructions,  threat,  and  aircraft  limitations.    (T-3)    Plan  to intercept a 3° glideslope at or before the MDA.  (T-3) 17.14.8.  Chart Preparation.  Use the largest scale chart available from 10 nm inbound.  (T-3)  A 1:50,000 chart is preferred, but in no case will it be larger than 1:250,000.  Select position and altimeter update points and brief the position to the crew during route study.  (T-3)  Chart construction  will  be  IAW  this  chapter  and  include  the  following  additional  items:    The  IP, AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   197  slowdown  points,  descent  point,  and  the  missed  approach,  departure,  and  go-around  paths.  Ensure update points for the mission computer  and altimeter are  annotated.   It  is  of utmost importance to have sufficient, reliable position and altitude update points prior to the IP and final run-in. 17.15.  SCA Template Construction. 17.15.1.  Use  the  most  current  sources  for  topographic  point  obstruction,  and  airfield information.    (T-3)    Consider  using  radar  reflectors,  radar  beacons,  or  existing  airfield NAVAIDS to increase the reliability of the approach. 17.15.2.  En Route Altitude.  In all cases, an MSL altitude profile will be planned.  (T-3) 17.15.3.  Obstacle  Clearance.    The  location  of  terrain  and  obstructions  will  dictate  the glideslope  and  altitude  profile  used.    (T-3)    Use  the  following  procedures  to  analyze obstacles:  (T-3) 17.15.4.  Straight-In  SCA.    Draw  the  horizontal  obstacle  clearance  template,  depicted  in Figure 17.3 on a 1:250,000 or larger scale chart, if available.  (T-3)  The template begins 0.3 nm  either  side  of  LZ  centerline  at  the  touchdown  point,  extending  outward  to  1  nm  either side of centerline at 3 nm from the touchdown point.  The template will encompass all terrain 1 nm either side of centerline from the planned descent point extending to 1 nm beyond the planned descent point (For example, a 3.2 nm planned descent point requires a 4.2 nm long template).  If the planned descent point is less than 2 nm from the touchdown zone, then the standard  3  nm  template  will  not  require  extension.    Refer  to  Figure  17.4,  SCA  Horizontal Obstruction Template.  Note:  These are minimum distances and may be increased.  Consider such factors as the availability of radar or EO/IR targets, recent NAVAID performance, and time of last computer update.   198  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Figure 17.3.  SCA Horizontal Obstruction Clearance Template.  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   199  Figure 17.4.  Turning SCA Horizontal Obstruction Clearance Template (Note:  Not to scale)  (1of 2).    200  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Figure 17.5.  Turning SCA Horizontal Obstruction Clearance Template (Note  Not to scale) (2 of 2).  17.15.5.  Turning  and  Circling  SCA.    The  obstacle  template  for  a  turning  or  circling  SCA consists of a modified version of the straight-in template.  Draw the turning SCA horizontal obstacle clearance template, depicted in  Figure 17.5, on a 1:250,000 or larger scale chart if available.  (T-3)  Draw the straight-in portion of the SCA template as if planning a straight-in SCA.    Select  the  feeder  distance  where  the  aircraft  will  intercept  runway  centerline.    From the pre- planned radius intercepting the feeder distance draw an inner and outer corridor.  For the outer corridor, draw a concentric circle with radius 1.0 nm greater than the planned radius of turn.   For the inner corridor, draw a  concentric circle  with  a radius  1.0 nm  less than the planned radius of turn.  Connect the inner and outer corridors with a line that is perpendicular AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   201  to  the  approach  path  at  the  point  1  nm  prior  to  glideslope  intercept.    When  the  glideslope intercept occurs prior to intercepting the turning path, draw lines parallel  to the offset course tangent  to  the  outer  and  inner  corridors.    When  using  a  large  radius  with  a  short  feeder distance,  draw  a  tangent  line  from  the  inner  corridor  to  the  template  0.3  nm  abeam  the runway.  See Figure 17.2 example B.  (T-3) Figure 17.6.  Critical Obstacle Chart.  17.15.6.  Significant  and  critical  obstacles.    Using  current  large-scale  charts,  airfield diagrams, airfield sketches, approach plates, and imagery, locate significant obstacles within the  boundary  of  the  horizontal  template.    Significant  obstacles  are  those  within  300  feet  of the desired glideslope.  Determine the HAT for each obstacle by subtracting TDZE from the MSL  elevation  of  the  obstacle.    For  each  obstacle,  plot  the  along-course  distance  from touchdown  and  HAT  on  the  critical  obstacle  graph  as  shown  in  Figure  17.6,  Critical Obstacle Chart.  An obstacle is considered critical if it falls above the reference line for the planned glideslope or its extension along the depicted baseline.  (T-3) 17.15.7.  For each critical obstacle identified, preplan and brief a specific means of avoidance to be used during the approach.  (T-3)  The following examples may be used separately or in combination: 17.15.7.1.  Use  a  steeper  glideslope.    Glideslopes  exceeding  4°  should  be  carefully considered due to the high rate of descent required.   202  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 17.15.7.2.  Move the touchdown point further down the runway. 17.15.7.3.  Increase MDA. 17.15.7.4.  Establish  an  intermediate  step-down  altitude  above  the  MDA  at  which  the aircraft will level off until positive separation from the obstacle is assured. 17.15.7.5.  Change  the  approach  to  the  opposite  end  of  the  runway,  to  a  crossing  runway, parallel runway, etc. 17.15.8.  SCA Vertical Template Construction.  Starting at the touchdown zone, construct a glideslope using the desired gradient (feet/nm) to a point along the final approach course (or transition  path,  if  applicable)  where  it  intercepts  the  planned  approach  altitude  (refer  to Figure 17.5).  Annotate the glideslope MSL and AGL altitudes for each 0.5 nm distance-to-go increment out to the planned descent point.  (T-3) Figure 17.7.  SCA Vertical Template. 17.15.9.  Draw the relative position of each critical obstacle on the template and annotate its distance-to-go, distance abeam final course centerline, and height (AGL and MSL). 17.15.10.  Missed Approach and Departure.  For planning, allow a minimum of 0.3 nm along track error and 0.3 nm cross-track error at the MAP.  Assume IMC when choosing the missed approach/departure flight path.  Construct a horizontal obstacle clearance template beginning at the MAP and incorporating the planned missed approach/departure flight path.  Use TDZE  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   203  as the MSL start point for the missed approach.  If the terrain along this flight path (including the above errors) rises at a rate greater than 200 feet/nm, refer to the performance manual to verify  that  three-engine  climb  out  will  clear  terrain.    Use  the  three-engine  climb  angle  in place of glideslope (refer to Figure 17.8 formula below).  (T-3) Figure 17.8.  Angle of Climb (Chart). Angle of Climb  =  Rate of Climb (ft/min)      x    ground speed (knots) 17.15.11.  The  horizontal  obstacle  clearance  template  for  climb  out  extends  from  the approach end of the runway out to 1.0 nm past level off at the initial escape en route altitude.  The lateral limits of the climb out template are the same as for the straight-in approach. 17.15.12.  If  any  critical  obstacles  are  identified,  consider  using  turns  during  climb  out  to avoid  them.    Ensure  that  the  three-engine  climb  path  provides  sufficient  clearance  from obstacles and terrain along the flight path. 17.16.  Approach Execution. 17.16.1.  The  Infil/Exfil checklist  is  recommended for all SCA, with  both pilots  monitoring system/CSO  guidance.    When  the  mission,  local  ATC  restrictions,  and  host  nation agreements  allow  use  of  covert  lights,  mark  the  runway  as  depicted  in  AFI  13-217,  Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. 17.16.1.1.  General.  Depending on the type of landing, the pilot will select either overt or covert  lighting.    If  the  PF  requires  lights  to  acquire  the  LZ  he  may  call  for  “wing  tip lights”, “taxi lights”, or “landing lights”.  Each pilot will ensure both NVG batteries are operational during the Infil/Exfil checklist.  (T-3) 17.16.1.2.  Instrument approaches using Infil/Exfil checklist.  When the tactical situation dictates flying an instrument approach while utilizing the Infil/Exfil checklist, ensure all briefing items from the approach checklist are covered.  Note:  During NVG operations, an NVG landing qualified pilot (non-instructor) may takeoff and land from the right seat provided  an  NVG  landing  qualified  pilot  is  in  the  left  seat  and  normal  (non-assault) procedures  are  used.    In  this  case,  either  pilot  may  fly  the  SCA,  with  the  other  pilot accomplishing the landing and subsequent takeoff.  Refer to Chapter 9 for touch-and- go restrictions.    Instructor  pilots  may  fly  both  the  SCA  and  landing  for  demonstration purposes.  During day operations or overt night operations to lit runways, either pilot may fly the SCA and landing. 17.16.2.  Aircraft  lighting  will  be  as  briefed/directed  by  ground  parties  for  authentication purposes.  The use of covert lighting will be thoroughly briefed in respect to threat, runway environment and authentication procedures. 17.17.  SCA and INFIL/EXFIL Crew Actions.  Note:  Use the following procedures regardless of  whether  the  INFIL/EXFIL  or  APPROACH  and  normal  BEFORE  LANDING  checklists  are used.  (T-3) 17.17.1.  Required warnings and calls. 17.17.1.1.  “20  minute  warning”,  “10  minute  warning”;  “30  seconds  to  slowdown”; “slowdown”;  distance  call  at  “2  nm”  (from  the  landing  zone);  “begin  decent”;  “missed   204  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 approach point” (if other than approach end of runway); and “100 ft”, “50 ft”, “25 ft” and “10  ft”  above  touchdown.    Additionally,  the  CSO  will  update  the  pilots  on  course, distance-to-go,  and  glide  path  profile  every  1  nm  until  3  nm  to  go,  then  every  1/2  nm until the “minimums” call.  (T-3) 17.17.1.2.  The  PF  will  determine  and  brief  what  additional  time  warnings  (with  user coordination) and calls are required for the mission to  be flown.  The PF and CSO will brief the SCA using the appropriate aircrew mission briefing guide.  (T-3) 17.17.2.  The  PM  will  determine  the  most  accurate  altimeter  setting  for  the  LZ  using  all available  sources  including  GPS,  weather  forecasts,  ground  station  reporting  and  altitude calibration, as available.  The PF and CSO will confirm what  altimeter setting will be used for the landing.  (T3) 17.17.3.  The PM will back up the flying pilot on the displays and confirm terrain clearance using  all  available  means  possible.    Both  the  PF  and  PM  will  clear  for  obstacles  and  other traffic.  (T-3) 17.17.4.  At the Initial Point (IP). 17.17.4.1.  The CSO will verify final course guidance accuracy.  (T-3) 17.17.4.2.  The CSO will confirm LZ alignment with the APN-241 (LPCR) and give final headings as required.  (T-3) 17.17.4.3.  Maintain en route profile until descent for landing.  (T-3) 17.17.5.  Slowdown Procedures. 17.17.5.1.  Slowdown should be initiated approximately 3 nm prior to the planned glide slope intercept point.  The CSO should initiate the slowdown. 17.17.5.2.  Slowdown  points  will  be  planned  and  briefed  for  tactical  approaches.    (T-3)  Pilots should initiate their own slowdowns for overhead and downwind approaches. 17.17.5.3.  Initiate  the  Before  Landing  Checklist  at  the  Slowdown  call.    Slow  to prebriefed speed at this planned point.  Ensure 100 percent flaps (if used) are set prior to reaching threshold speed.  (T-3) 17.17.5.4.  Do  not  slow  to  threshold  speed  until  established  on  final  for  both  straight-in and  turning  SCAs.    For  turning  SCAs,  maintain  approach  speed  in  the  turn.    (T-3)    WARNING:    The  obstacle  clearance  procedures  in  this  chapter  are  not  applicable  to NVG  operations  conducted  in  a  visual  pattern.    The  pilot  must  maintain  visual  contact with the LZ and with surrounding terrain in order to execute a successful approach. 17.17.6.  Glide slope Intercept. 17.17.6.1.  The pilot flying will begin descent upon CSO direction or following the flight director cue (IPRA) unless  directed otherwise by the CSO.  (T-3)      WARNING:  The pilot  monitoring  and  CSO  must  closely  monitor  radar  altimeters  to  ensure  accuracy  of altimeter settings to prevent inadvertently flying below planned AGL minimums.  (T-3) 17.17.6.2.  At glide slope intercept, the CSO will state “Begin Descent” and should repeat the desired initial descent angle.  The CSO will monitor course and glide slope deviation using  a  PFD  display.    Report  deviations  greater  than  50  ft  vertically,  or  50  yards AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   205  horizontally, along with an advisory as to whether the aircraft is correcting to, paralleling, or diverging from course/glide path.  (T-3) 17.17.7.  Setting  Radar  Altimeters.    Radar  altimeters  should  be  set  no  lower  than  50  feet below decision height or height above touchdown.  (T-3) 17.17.8.  Set the MDA in the Ref Set panel. 17.17.9.  Descent.    Do  not  descend  below  MDA  until  the  LZ  environment  is  identified visually and confirmed by both pilots.  Whoever identifies the LZ first will call out “ZONE IN SIGHT”, and any discrepancies noted (i.e., any lights out, etc.).  The other pilot will then confirm the zone and call out its clock position, then cross-check the alignment for the proper heading.    (T-3)    WARNING:    Use  of  a  5°  glide  slope  can  cause  descent  rates  in  excess  of 1,000  feet  per  minute.    WARNING:    In  no  case  will  a  descent  below  300  feet  AGL  be initiated prior to 2 nm to touchdown. 17.17.10.  The CSO will use the APN-241 (LPCR) to  verify  the runway  has been correctly identified after completing the final position update.  (T-3) 17.17.11.  After  Landing.    Note:    During  INFIL/EXFIL  procedures,  the  pilot  may  pre-brief the opening of the ramp  and door upon reversing of the engines.  Opening of the ramp and door initiates the “On The Runway Checklist”.  (T-3) 17.17.11.1.  The copilot and CSO will assist the pilot in locating the offload/onload point and clearing for other aircraft and obstructions once taxi speed is reached.  (T-3) 17.17.11.2.  Use  overt/covert  taxi  and  landing  lights  to  the  minimum  extent  required  to maintain visual references.  (T-3) 17.17.12.  Takeoff. 17.17.12.1.  The “On The Runway Checklist” for INFIL/EXFIL is automatically initiated when the pilot clears the ramp and door.  Complete the “On The Runway Checklist” prior to takeoff.  (T-3) 17.17.13.  Go-Around and Departure Procedures. 17.17.13.1.  For SCA’s and tactical operations, when executing a go-around or departure, the  CSO  will  state:    “100”,  “200”,  “300”  feet  then  direct  an  initial  heading/course  and altitude.    During  a  go-around  initiate  the  Go-around  Checklist.    (T-3)          CAUTION:  Pilots  are  more  susceptible  to  spatial  disorientation  during  NVG  go-arounds  and departures. 17.17.13.2.  If  an  immediate  approach  and  landing  are  not  feasible  complete  the  After Takeoff Checklist.  (T-3) 17.17.14.  Loss of NVGs: 17.17.14.1.  Before  Landing.   If the pilot  or copilot  loses use of their NVGs inside of 1 nm, perform a go-around.  (T-3) 17.17.14.2.  After  Takeoff.    The  PF  should  transfer  aircraft  control  and  continue  the climb to enroute altitude.   206  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 17.17.14.3.  On  the  Ground.    The  PF  will  determine  whether  to  continue  the  landing rollout or takeoff roll as applicable.  (T-3)  The PM should be prepared to turn on overt lighting at the direction of the PIC in case of NVG failure during takeoff or landing roll. 17.18.  Random Tactical Approaches. 17.18.1.  Tactical Random Approaches.  MP(s), without a low level qualified crew, will fly no  lower  than  MSA  outside  the  aerodrome  protected  circling  airspace.    (T-3)    Within  the protected circling airspace, fly no lower than appropriate category circling MDA/HAA.  (T-3) 17.18.2.  Minimum  Intermediate  Altitude.    Defined  as  300  feet  above  the  highest  obstacle within 2 nm either side of course centerline.  It may extend to no more than 20 nm from the objective (LZ/DZ) and no less than 1nm prior to the planned level off point.  This altitude is used  in  conjunction  with  the  Drop  High  and  Approach  High  profiles.    Lateral  defensive maneuvers should be minimized do the proximity of higher terrain 2 nm from centerline. 17.18.3.  EC-130J Minimum Altitude.  Defined as 500 feet above the highest obstacle within 1 nm either side of course centerline rounded up to the next hundred feet of altitude.  It may extend to no more than 10 nm from the objective (LZ/DZ) and no less than 1 nm prior to the planned level off point and will extend 1 nm past the objective (LZ/DZ).  When operating at this  altitude  crews  should  only  exercise  vertical  defensive  maneuvers  until  at  or  above  the Minimum Intermediate Altitude. 17.19.  Airdrop Operations. 17.19.1.  Airdrop General. 17.19.1.1.  Each CSO performing an airdrop will compute a CARP/HARP.  (T-3) 17.19.1.1.1.  The  CSO  will  plot  and  brief  the  CARP/HARP  location  on  a drop  zone mosaic.  Drop  Zone  mosaic  will  be  annotated  with  run-in  course,  CARP/HARP location,  load  type/weight/chute,  visual  references  (as  required),  red  light  location, 10-second  location,  ballistic  winds,  drop  safety  box,  escape/racetrack,  and  all  other requirements outlined in AFI 11-231. 17.19.1.2.  Airdrops will normally be system directed drops backed up by the pilots and CSO. 17.19.1.3.  Airdrops  may  be  conducted  in  IMC  and  VMC.    For  detailed  information  on DZ sizes, markings, types, and weather and wind limits, refer to AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations.  For information on aerial delivery airspeeds and altitudes, refer to AFI 11-231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures. 17.19.1.4.  Airdrop Kits.  The loadmaster will refer to Loadmaster Procedures Chapter of this regulation. 17.19.1.5.  Specific  in-flight  visual  signals,  verbal  signals,  and  interphone  procedures between the jumpmaster and loadmaster are coordinated during the jumpmaster briefing. 17.19.1.6.  Required Navigation Accuracy.  The navigation accuracy required for a given mission  will  vary  depending  on  the  type  of  mission  and  other  considerations.    For airdrops,  to  provide  an  early  indication  of  degraded  navigation  accuracy,  set  the  POS ALERT(s)  at  0.03  nm  (~  55  yards;  FOM  2)  and  0.05  nm  (~  110  yards;  FOM  4).  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   207  Normally,  airdrop  accuracy  requirements  (300  yd  Computed  Air  Probability)  are  met  if the ship solution FOM is less than or equal to 4 and no POS ALERTs are indicated.  If these  conditions  are  not  met,  further  action  (radar  or  visual  cross-check/update)  is necessary to verify/improve navigation accuracy prior to performing airdrops. 17.19.1.7.  Minimum  en  route  time  from  takeoff  to  time  over  release  point  will  be sufficient  to  safely accomplish  all required checklists.  For airdrop involving personnel, the jumpmaster must approve en route time of less than 25 minutes. 17.19.1.8.  Jumpmaster  directed  (JMD)  Directed  Procedures.    JMD  personnel  airdrops require Group/CC approval.  (T-3)  For JMD drops, the jumpmasters’ parent service/user accepts all responsibility for the accuracy of the drop plus any potential injury/damage to equipment.  Note:  For HARP operations if jumpmaster’s solution falls within the CNI-MU drive circle then the airdrop is not considered a jumpmaster directed airdrop.  CNI-MU  safety  factor  will  not  exceed  80%,  and  approach/safety  factor  will  be  not  less  than 1,000 feet.  (T-3) 17.19.1.8.1.  During  JMD,  the  jumpmaster  determines  the  release  point  (RP) mathematically or by wind drift indicator.  The jumpmaster directs the aircraft to the RP using steering commands to the aircrew.  CSOs will accomplish CARP or HARP calculations  to  back  up  the  computations  and  in-flight  directions  given  by  the jumpmaster.  (T-3)  The following conditions apply:  (T-3) 17.19.1.8.2.  Prior  to  completing  the  Run-In  checks,  the  loadmaster  permits  the jumpmaster access to the door to begin "spotting procedures".  The slowdown should be  adjusted  to  allow  the  jumpmaster  to  begin  spotting  procedures  not  less  than  two minutes out.  The jumpmaster visually relays steering signals to the loadmaster, who verbally relays these signals to the pilot.  The jumpmaster may spot from the aircraft ramp or a paratroop door. 17.19.1.8.3.  Upon entering the leading edge of the updated  LAR (or  as  coordinated with  the  Jumpmaster),  the  PM  turns  on  the  green  light  to  indicate  clearance  for  the jumpmaster to make a final decision as to the exact exit point.  Jumpers may exit on the  jumpmaster’s  direction  while  the  green  light  is  illuminated.    The  red  light  is turned on at the end of the CSO’s computed usable DZ distance (or green light time IAW  AFI  13-217,  AFSOC  Supp)  or  when  the  last  jumper  or  load  exits,  whichever occurs first.  No jumpers should exit after the red light is turned on. 17.19.1.8.4.  JMD releases will not be mixed with any other type of airdrop method, i.e., general  mobile radio service (GMRS), verbally initiated release system  (VIRS), or standard CARP drops.  (T-3)  If JMD drop procedures are called for, the crew will follow the jumpmaster’s instructions, while adhering to normal safety concerns.  (T-3)  Should the crew believe the drop would occur outside of safe parameters, they will call “no drop” and ensure the red light is illuminated. 17.19.2.  Airdrop Planning. 17.19.2.1.  Crews  will  not  perform  airdrops  using  parachutes  for  which  AFI  11-231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures, does not list ballistics unless the user provides ballistic data or K factor that has been verified by HQ AFSOC/A3V.  This does not apply   208  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 to  formal  test  missions  where  the  purpose  of  the  test  is  to  derive  ballistic  data  for  a specific load.  (T-2) 17.19.2.2.  The PIC and the CSO will review the DZ survey during mission planning.  (T-3) 17.19.2.3.  When airdropping military free fall (MFF) personnel, coordinate the following with  the  jumpmaster:  forecast  local  altimeter  setting  at  the  planned  drop  zone;  en  route flying  time  from  takeoff  to  airdrop,  and  jumpmaster’s  plan  to  calculate  and  set  the cypress automatic actuation device (AAD), if used.  (T-3) 17.19.2.4.  Oxygen requirements will be per AFI 11-409, High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support Program, and AFI 11-202, Vol 3. 17.19.3.  Airdrop Communications Procedures. 17.19.3.1.  During airdrop, after acknowledgement of the 20minute warning and donning of the helmet, loadmasters may clear off interphone, with the PIC approval, to facilitate movement  around  large  platforms  or  CDS  loads.    The  CSO  will  accomplish  the  brief associated  with  the  20minute  warning.    (T-3)    After  completing  the  required  20minute checklist  items,  the  primary  loadmaster  will  remain  on  interphone  throughout  the remainder of the airdrop.  (T-3) 17.19.3.2.  Training  Operations.    Radio  transmissions  with  the  DZ  are  limited  to  those required  for  safety  of  flight  considerations  or  factors  affecting  airborne  force employment.    (T-3)    This  includes  ATC  directions,  range  clearance,  unsafe  surface conditions or mission changes.  When the mission dictates radio silence, transmission of wind information and range or drop clearance is not required.  Radio silence procedures will be coordinated prior to mission execution.  (T-3) 17.19.3.3.  Drop clearance is normally inherent with mission clearance to unmanned DZ.  The  aircrew  observing  the  proper  briefed  authentication  confirms  drop  clearance  in VMC. 17.19.3.4.  In IMC, drop clearance is confirmed via radio call or beacon acquisition. 17.19.3.5.  In  VMC,  a  no-drop  or  mission  cancellation  is  communicated by  the  absence of  prebriefed  markings  (visual  or  electronic),  jumbled  block  letter,  observation  of  the block letter X, or red smoke, light, or flare or as briefed.  In IMC, a no-drop or mission cancellation  is  communicated  by  an  authenticated  radio  transmission  or  absence  of  the beacon. 17.19.3.6.  During  flight  for  an  MFF  airdrop,  the  jumpmaster  will  receive  an  update  of the local altimeter setting for the planned drop zone (if available) from the aircrew at the 10 minute warning.  (T-3)  The jumpmaster will reconfirm this setting with the aircrew.  (T-3) 17.19.4.  Ramp and Door and Paratroop Door Operations. 17.19.4.1.  Clearance to Open.  The PF may direct ramp and door opening anytime after the  sixminute  advisory  for  personnel  drops  or  as  mission  dictates  for  non-personnel drops.  Consider added drag, power available, climb requirements, built up areas, airdrop rigging,  and  the  possibility  of  dropped  objects  when  the  door  is  opened.      WARNING:  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   209  Do  not  open  the  ramp  and  door  to  accomplish  SATB/simulated  airdrops  with  loads rigged with an extraction parachute in the bomb rack.  If the actual airdrop loads cannot be  dropped,  the  extraction  parachute  will  be  removed  from  the  bomb  rack  and  secured forward of the load.  (T-3) 17.19.4.2.  Loadmaster-Jumpmaster  Control.    When  the  aircraft  is  in  its  final  airdrop configuration, the primary loadmaster may relinquish control of the paratroop doors/ramp and  door  to  the  jumpmaster  (no  later  than  2  minutes  prior  for  JMD  drops).    The loadmasters will then take a position on the cargo ramp  in  such a manner as to  provide maximum maneuverability for jumpmasters and safety personnel to perform their duties.  (T-3)    For  ramp  and  cargo  door  exits,  the  loadmaster(s)  will  take  a  position  to  prevent interference  with  exiting  jumpers.    (T-3)    Upon  seeing  the  red  light  illuminate,  the primary  loadmaster  will  notify  the  jumpmasters  or  safety  personnel  of  the  red  light condition.  (T-3)  The loadmaster will take no further action to stop any of the remaining parachutists.  (T-3)  The loadmasters will count (if possible) any parachutists that exit the aircraft after the red light has illuminated.  Control of the paratroop doors/ramp and door will  revert  back  to  the  loadmasters  after  all  parachutists  have  exited  or  remaining parachutists  have  been  stopped  by  the  jumpmaster  or  safety  and  cleared  from  the  door area.    (T3)    For  multiple  passes  (racetracks),  after  assuming  control  of  the  paratroop doors/ramp  and door from  the jumpmaster, the loadmasters will maintain control of the doors until completion of subsequent checklists.  (T-3)    WARNING:  During personnel airdrops, the loadmasters will not position themselves directly under the aft anchor cable supports (A-Frame, FS 737).  (T-3)    WARNING:  Ensure all personnel aft of FS 737 are secured to the aircraft or have a static line connected prior to opening the ramp and door.  (T-3)  HALO/ HAHO personnel must be configured and ready to jump.  (T-3) 17.19.4.3.  Multiple Passes (Racetracks).  When performing multiple equipment airdrops across the same DZ, all airdrop checklists will be accomplished.  (T-3)  When performing multiple  personnel  drops  across  the  same  DZ,  checklists  may  resume  at  the  6  minute warning assuming no airdrop parameters or aircraft configuration changes are made from the  previous  drop.    Ensure  the  loadmaster  has  adequate  time  to  complete  all  checklist items before the drop.  (T-3)  Exception:  During non JMD (pilot directed) airdrops, the checklist  may  be  initiated  at  a  point  commensurate  with  the  available  time  and  type  of drop.    This  will  be  coordinated  at  the  Pilot-Loadmaster/Jumpmaster/Troop  Commander Briefing.  When airdrop  parameters or aircraft configuration changes are  made between drops, all checklists will be accomplished.  (T-3)  Airdrop time advisories and checklists may be compressed, except for the one minute warning.  Doors may remain open at the discretion of the PF. 17.19.4.4.  Tailgate Drops.  The following restrictions apply:  (T-3) 17.19.4.4.1.  Rig both anchor cables and both static line retrievers prior to takeoff (if applicable).  (T-3) 17.19.4.4.2.  Use one anchor cable for each pass and limit each pass to a maximum of 20 static lines.  (T-3) 17.19.4.4.3.  Use the opposite anchor cable if another pass is required.  (T-3)   210  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 17.19.4.4.4.  Retrieve static lines and deployment bags prior to  each additional pass.  (T-3) 17.19.5.  Airdrop Execution. 17.19.5.1.  System/Visual Airdrops.  The primary method for aerial delivery is automatic release at the computer derived release point.  (T-3)  Visual Airdrops are not authorized (does not apply to JMD airdrops).  (T-3) 17.19.5.2.  CSOs  will  update  the  jumpmaster  in-flight  on  actual  wind  information  and any changes to the crew’s preflight computed CARP/HARP location.  The crew will also update  the  jumpmaster  with  the  local  altimeter  setting  for  the  planned  drop  zone  (if available) at the 10minute warning.  The jumpmaster will reconfirm this setting with the aircrew.   (T-3) 17.19.5.3.  Approved computer-aided (CARP and HARP) programs may be used, but the CSO must verify the results. 17.19.5.4.  The CSO will verify the actual number and type of parachutes, load weights, sequence  of  delivery,  and  position  of  loads  in  the  aircraft.    (T-3)    Recalculate CARP/HARP  if  actual  conditions  differ  from  the  preplanned  configuration.    (T-3)     WARNING:  Military CYPRES AADs require both a descent below 1,500 feet AGL and 115  feet  per  second  (6900  vvi)  descent  rate  threshold  before  it  will  deploy  the  reserve parachute.  Jumpmasters will program the CYPRES in flight if en route time exceeds one hour  to  the  drop  zone,  and  require  an  accurate  local  altimeter  setting  to  do  so.    A programmed  altimeter  setting  significantly  different  from  the  actual  local  altimeter  can result in unintended deployment of the reserve canopy or failure to deploy when needed, endangering MFF personnel.  Use of auto-pressurization can also cause activation of the CYPRES AAD just after take-off in certain situations. 17.19.5.5.  Safety Device.  Provide safety personnel with parachutes carried on board the aircraft.  (T-3)  They may use a restraint harness at their discretion, if available.  Provide a  restraint  harness  to  other  personnel  required  to  be  mobile  in  the  cargo  compartment.  (T-3) 17.19.5.6.  A  DD  Form  1748,  Joint  Airdrop  Inspection  Record,  will  be  accomplished prior to  all equipment  airdrops.  Completion, retention, and disposition of the form  will be  in  accordance  with  the  Air  Force  Joint  Instruction  (AFJI)  13-210,  Joint  Airdrop Inspection  Records,  Malfunction/Incident  Investigations,  and  Activity  Reporting,  as supplemented.    Exception:    A-7A  and  A-21  containers  rigged  for  door  bundles.    The aerial delivery unit supporting movement of equipment and supplies will ensure current publications are available to the loadmaster to ensure standardization of joint inspections.  (T-3)    Aerial  delivery  units  supporting  AFSOC  unilateral  airdrop  training  will  provide copies of required publications.  (T-3) 17.19.5.7.  In-Flight  Rigging  Procedures.    In-flight  rigging  is  a  safe  procedure  if accomplished  under  a  controlled  situation.    Accomplish  in-flight  rigging  only  when  the safety  of  the  personnel  required  to  be  mobile  in  the  cargo  compartment  is  not jeopardized.    (T-3)    The  aircraft  may  have  to  change  altitude.    Use  the  following procedures on airdrop missions that require in-flight rigging:  (T-3) AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   211  17.19.5.7.1.  Two  loadmasters  are  required,  except  for  SATB.    At  least  one loadmaster will remain on interphone at all times.  (T-3) 17.19.5.7.2.  The use of the pendulum release system is optional for SATBs. 17.19.5.7.3.  Make  an  in-flight  check  of  the  rigged  items  using  the  DD  Form  1748, Joint Airdrop Inspection Record. 17.19.5.8.  Airspeed adjustments should be completed prior to slowdown.   WARNING:  For personnel airdrops, the pilot must be aware of paratroopers standing in the back and avoid drastic pitch, bank and power changes after the Six Minute Advisory.  (T-3)  Use of auto throttles may cause drastic speed changes resulting in an unstable platform. 17.19.5.9.  For paratroop door drops.  The PM opens the air deflector doors upon slowing below  150  knots  indicated  air  speed  (KIAS).    Once  air  deflector  doors  are  called  open, this automatically clears the LM to open the paratroop doors. 17.19.6.  IMC Drop. 17.19.6.1.  Drop Altitude.  Plan minimum IMC drop altitudes at MSA or as specified in AFI 11231, Computed Air Release Point Procedures, whichever is higher. 17.19.6.2.  As  defined  in  Federal  Aviation  Regulation  (FAR)  Exemption  4371L operations must be conducted at 500 feet above the highest obstacles within 3 nm of the course to be flown over mountainous or other areas.  (T-1)  Note:  Crews may segment drop corridor MSAs as mission requirements dictate. 17.19.6.2.1.  DZ Entry Point.  The point where an aircraft may safely begin  descent from IFR en route altitude or a segmented altitude to IMC drop altitude. 17.19.6.2.2.  DZ  Exit  Point.    A  fixed  point  on  the  DZ  escape  flight  path  centerline where  each  aircraft  will  be  at  minimum  IFR  en  route  altitude.    (T-3)    Normally, calculate the exit point based on a 1,000 feet per minute (FPM) climb at 140 KIAS.  (T-3)    Analyze  3-engine  climb  performance  and  ensure  obstacle  clearance  at  pre-airdrop  gross  weight.    (T-3)    If  unable  to  clear  all  obstacles  on  3engines,  adjust  the DZ  exit  point  based  on  3-engine  climb  capability.    (T-3)    This  point  will  be  a minimum  of  4  nm  track  distance  from  the  trailing  edge  of  the  DZ.    (T-3)    WARNING:    Analyze  pre-drop  gross  weight  to  determine  if  obstructions  can  be cleared on 3engines from DZ entry through DZ exit.  (T-3)  If obstructions cannot be cleared  reduce  aircraft  gross  weight,  revise  run-in  and/or  escape  course,  or  increase drop altitude. 17.19.7.  No-Drop Decisions. 17.19.7.1.  Prior  to  the  1  minute  warning  (2  min  for  high  altitude  combination  drops), notify the PIC when any condition exists that could jeopardize a safe drop.  (T-3) 17.19.7.2.  After the 1 minute warning (2 min for high altitude combination drops), any crew member observing a condition that would jeopardize a safe drop will transmit "No-drop" on the interphone.  (T-3) 17.19.7.3.  For  heavy  equipment  (HE)  airdrops  any  multifunction  control  display (MFCD)  ACAWS  occurring  after  the  1  minute  warning  time  advisory,  the  loadmaster will call a “Nodrop”.  (T-3)   212  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 17.19.7.4.  A “No-drop” will be called if all checklists through the 1 minute warning are not completed prior to the “Standby Drogue” advisory for HE towplate drops or by the “5 Second” call for all other drops.  (T-3) 17.19.7.4.1.  The  PM,  CSO,  and  LM  will  acknowledge  the  "No-drop"  call.    (T-3)  The  PM  will  place  the  Computer  Drop  switch  to  “Manual”  to  prevent  automatic release  of  the  load.    The  PF  will  immediately  instruct  the  crew  to  follow  the appropriate procedures.  (T-3) 17.19.7.4.2.  If a no-drop is called after the load restraint is removed and a racetrack is not planned, reapply the load restraint.  (T-3) 17.19.7.5.  Stopping  a  drop  in  progress.    Any  crew  member  recognizing  an  unsafe condition during an airdrop will state "red light".  (T-3)  The PM will turn on the red light to signal the airdrop termination.  (T-3) 17.19.7.6.  On personnel airdrops where surface winds are unknown, (such as unmanned DZs) advise the jumpmaster and Army airborne mission commander when drop altitude winds  exceed  30  knots  (KTS).    (T-3)    In  this  instance,  the  decision  to  drop  is  at  user's discretion. 17.19.8.  Departure from DZ (Escape).  The CSO will call “red light” at the expiration of the “green  light”  time.    (T-3)    When  the  LM  calls  “bags  in”,  immediately  begin  the  escape maneuver.    (T-3)    Do  not  exceed  140  KIAS  until  the  static  lines  are  retrieved  to  preclude entanglement.  (T-3)  During combat, static lines that cannot be retrieved will be cut so that doors can be closed.  (T-3)  Close all doors, raise flaps, and accelerate to en route airspeed.  (T3)    It  is  imperative  that  the  aircraft  be  configured  for  high  speed  evasive  maneuvers.  Therefore, after the static lines have been retrieved or cut, the doors and air deflectors closed, and  flaps  raised,  the  remainder  of  the  post-drop  checklist  may  be  deferred  to  a  more convenient time while returning to the recovery base.    WARNING:  Coordination between the  PF  and  Loadmaster  should  be  accomplished  prior  to  the  airdrop  to  prevent  injury  of aircrew in the back of the aircraft once the power levers are advanced to max power for the escape. 17.19.9.  Static Line Retrieval.  Loadmasters should allow a few moments for static lines to wrap together before retrieving static lines.  Designated aircrew members will retrieve static lines as soon as possible after parachutist or bundle exit is completed or exiting is suspended.  (T-3)  During combat, static lines that cannot be retrieved will be cut so doors can be closed.  (T-3)  If the static line retriever fails, static lines will be manually retrieved using a tie-down strap as follows.  (T-3)  Note:  A maximum of ten static lines may be retrieved manually per paratroop door.  (T-3)  A maximum of 20 static lines per cable may be retrieved with a static line retriever winch.  (T-3) 17.19.9.1.  Static Line Retriever alternate recovery procedures: 17.19.9.2.  The following procedures will be used when the Static Line Retrieval System is unavailable.  (T-3) 17.19.9.2.1.  Paratroop Door. 17.19.9.2.1.1.  Secure the hook end of a cargo strap to a point far enough forward in the cargo compartment to allow static lines to completely enter the aircraft.  (T-AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   213  3) 17.19.9.2.1.2.  Insert the other end of the cargo strap from the bottom up, making a "U" around the static lines.  (T-3) 17.19.9.2.1.3.  Pull  the  strap  forward  to  retrieve  the  static  lines  into  the  aircraft.  (T-3)  Loadmasters may require assistance to pull the strap forward. 17.19.9.2.2.  Ramp and Door. 17.19.9.2.2.1.  If  the  static  line  retriever  fails  following  a  combination/tailgate drop, use the Prusik Knot as described below.  (T-3)  Refer to Figure 17.9, Prusik Knot. 17.19.9.2.2.2.  Take a 30 inch piece of 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord that is tied in a loop.  (T-3)  Loop the cord around the static line retriever cable as shown in the figure.  (T-3)  Use a minimum of three wraps around the retriever cable to ensure locking of the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord.  (T-3) 17.19.9.2.2.3.  Pull to tighten the knot around the retriever winch cable to prevent slipping.  (T3)  Attach the hook end of a 5,000 pound strap into the loop's end and pull in the static lines.  (T-3)  The 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord will remain locked in place under tension.  (T-3) 17.19.9.2.2.4.  More than one 1/2 -inch tubular nylon cord may be attached to the winch  cable  using  the  Prusik  Knot  to  facilitate  static  line  retrieval.    The  Prusik Knot may be adjusted up or down the cable as required.  The knot will not slip as long  as  it  is  wrapped  tightly  with  a  minimum  of  three  turns  (more  wraps  equal more friction), and tension is applied. 17.19.9.2.2.5.  To  prevent  cutting  the  1/2-inch  tubular  nylon  cord  with  the  hook on  the  5,000  pound  strap,  a  carabineer  may  be  attached  to  the  1/2-inch  tubular nylon cord loop and the hook attached to carabineer.   214  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Figure 17.9.  Prusik Knot.  17.19.10.  Airdrop  Malfunction  and  Emergencies.    Specific  emergency  procedures  for  each type  airdrop  are  located  in  the  TO  1C-130(E)J-1  checklists  or  the  appropriate  MAJCOM approved  guidance.    After  all  appropriate  emergency  actions  are  complete,  accomplish  the Completion  of  Drop  (COD)  checklist.    (T-3)    Note:    Prior  to  stations  time,  the  pilot  will ensure all crew members have reviewed the emergency procedures for the proposed airdrop.  (T-3)  The aircrew will conduct detailed emergency briefings.  (T-3)  Loadmasters will brief visual and verbal signals and establish coordinated tasks for their crew position prior to the first airdrop warning.  (T-3) 17.19.11.  Combination  Drops.    Combination  drops  are  when  parachutists  exit  after  the airdrop load.  The item requiring the highest altitude will determine the drop altitude.  (T-3) 17.19.11.1.  Restrictions.    A  maximum  of  20  personnel  static  lines may  be  deployed  on each pass and only one anchor cable will be used for these static lines.  (T-3)  Static lines AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   215  for  equipment  will  be  attached  to  opposite  anchor  cables  and  must  be  rigged  for breakaway.  (T-3)  Exception:  When airdrop loads are rigged with pilot chutes packed in T-10 bags, they will be attached to the same anchor cable as personnel.  (T-3)  Maximum static lines per cable are 20.  (T-3)  Static lines will be retrieved after each pass. 17.19.11.2.  Procedures.    In  addition  to  the  equipment  CARP,  the  CSO  will  compute  a personnel  CARP  down  track  from  the  equipment  release  point  using  the  computed  exit time for the equipment drop as the interval between the equipment and personnel CARP.  (T-3)  Use the same airspeed and altitude as for the equipment for this computation.  (T-3)    If  the  computed  release  point  will  result  in  any  jumper  landing  within  150  yards  of any  boundary  of  the  DZ,  inform  the  jumpmaster.    (T-3)    Release  the  equipment  at  the equipment CARP, followed by the parachutists when the door is clear.  (T-3)  Exception:  For door and ramp bundles, use release points as specified in Paragraph 17.19.17.2.3. 17.19.12.  Low-Altitude Airdrops.  For detailed information, refer to AFTTP 3-3.E/MC-130J.  Refer to the expanded checklist for normal and emergency airdrop procedures. 17.19.13.  Personnel Drops. 17.19.13.1.  Aircraft Configuration.  The loadmaster will ensure the configuration of the anchor cables and seats are consistent with the number of personnel to be airdropped.  (T-3)  During aircraft preflight,  the loadmaster will ensure that all seats  have a serviceable retaining  strap  attached.    (T-3)    Fit  seats  without  a  serviceable  retaining  strap  with  a suitable length of type III nylon, premeasured for sufficient length to secure the seat in a raised position to the seat back support frame.  (T-3)  For single pass drops, ensure that parachutists have secured all seats (as required) and no part of the seat protrudes into the aisle.  (T-3)  On multiple passes, the number of parachutists to be dropped on that pass determines the number of seats raised.  (T-3)  Troop seats will be raised and secured, or lowered,  as  required,  by  personnel  under  the  supervision  and  instruction  of  the loadmaster.  (T-3)  Floor loading is authorized in accordance with Chapter 6. 17.19.13.2.  Aircraft Emergency During Personnel Airdrop.  When an aircraft emergency occurs  during  or  after  the  time  the  parachutists  stand  and  hookup,  the  following procedures will apply:  (T-3) 17.19.13.2.1.  Under  acceptable  conditions  when  parachutists’  bailout  is  required, maintain  an  acceptable  altitude  and  attitude  for  the  parachutists  to  evacuate  the aircraft.    (T-3)    The  minimum  acceptable  altitude  is  as  briefed.    (T-3)    If  the  jump airspeed will be in excess of 150 KIAS/Knots Calibrated Air Speed (KCAS), advise the parachutists of the airspeed and altitude.  (T-3)  Order evacuation of the aircraft by giving the pre-briefed bailout emergency signals.  (T-3) 17.19.13.2.1.1.  Minimum emergency bail-out altitude for free-fall parachutists is 2,000 feet AGL.  (T-3) 17.19.13.2.2.  When conditions are not acceptable for parachutists’ bailout or a drop is aborted for other reasons, the following procedures apply:  (T-3) 17.19.13.2.2.1.  The  red  light  will  be  turned  "ON"  and  will  remain  on  until  exit doors are closed.  (T-3) 17.19.13.2.2.2.  The  PF  will  advise  the  loadmaster,  who  in  turn  will  advise  the   216  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 jumpmaster  to  have  the  parachutists  unhook,  take  their  seats,  and  fasten  safety belts.  (T-3) 17.19.14.  Container Delivery System.  Container delivery system is designed to airdrop A-22/A-23,  A-7,  A-21,  double  A-22/A-23  containers  and  loads  rigged  on  combat  expendable platforms.  The weight of each container and type parachute used should be IAW  TO 13C7-series/Field Manual 10-501 and USSOCOM 350-series rigging manuals. 17.19.14.1.  CDS  rigging  procedures.    Utilize  rigging  procedures  outlined  in    TO 1C130J9.    The  following  describes  the  types  of  CDS  releases  that  may  be  used  on AFSOC EC130J aircraft. 17.19.14.2.  Normal  System  Release.    A  normal  system  release  utilizes  the  static  line retriever and guillotine knife to cut/release the CDS gate.  When using this method, the loadmaster  may  assist  the  release  by  pulling  down  sharply  on  the  static  line  retriever winch cable. 17.19.14.3.  Manual Gate Cut.  A manual gate cut is defined as using a knife or V blade type knife to cut/release the CDS gate for all single stick container drops.  Loads rigged with  type  XXVI/VIII  nylon  not  exceeding  5,000  may  be  manually  cut  using  these procedures. 17.19.14.4.  Combat Cut.  A combat cut is defined as using a knife or V blade type knife to cut the CDS gate regardless of amount, weight, and configuration of CDS on board.  It is  used  only  when  authorized  as  part  of  specific  exercise  operations  order  or  plan, contingencies, or by COMAFSOF.  (T-3) 17.19.15.  CDS/CRRC/RAMZ  Specific  Procedures:          WARNING:    The  aircraft  tends  to pitch up as the load exits the aircraft.  This pitch must be anticipated and controlled to allow no more than 2 or 3°additional pitch.  (T-3)  Do not  over control to  the point that negative gravity G forces are encountered.  (T-3) 17.19.15.1.  Escape.  Departing the DZ, set flaps to 50%, accelerate to en route airspeed, climb or descend as briefed and perform the completion of drop checklist.  (T-3)  Flaps may be called up at the discretion of the PF in lieu of going to 50%. 17.19.15.2.  Combat  Rubber  Raiding  Craft  Drop.    CRRCs  may  be  dropped  in  a  stacked configuration  allowing  up  to  four  CRRCs  to  be  dropped  on  a  single  pass.    One  CRRC platform  can  be  dropped  using  the  standard  CDS  or  container  recovery  system  (CRS) checklist.    When  two  CRRC  platforms  are  dropped  on  a  single  pass,  use  the  CDS checklist.  (T-3)  Two CRRC platforms with up to 18 personnel or one CRRC platform with  up to  19 personnel  can be airdropped on one pass.   Rigged  IAW TO 13C7-51.   If aircraft  gross  weight  exceeds  120,000  pounds,  use  140  KIAS/KCAS  CDS/CRS  flap setting chart.  (T-3)  Exception:  For combination drops above 120,000 pounds use 130 KIAS/KCAS and 130 KCAS flap setting chart.  (T-3) 17.19.15.2.1.  Emergency Procedures.  Use CDS airdrop emergency procedures. 17.19.15.2.2.  Training and Exercises.  One or more recovery boats will be in position to recover platforms, parachutes, and personnel.  (T-3)  The boat should be displaced 400 yards or more from the DZ axis.  The CSO or PM can confirm the release point and offset distance visually or by using radar returns. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   217  17.19.15.2.3.  DZ Axis.  If possible, the DZ axis will be into the drop altitude wind (± 30°)  when  the  wind  is  5  knots  or  greater.    The  jumpmaster  will  be  advised  if  this cannot be done. 17.19.15.2.4.  Backup  Drop  Platform.    The  raiding  party  exits  when  the  pilot  chute deploys.  In operational employments, a second platform may be carried as a backup in  case  the  main  chute  fails  following  pilot  chute  deployment.    Backup  platform release  point  and  aircrew  or  raiding  party  communication  and  procedures  will  be coordinated prior to the mission.  Procedures and tactics will also be coordinated for airdrop of a second platform and party, if applicable. 17.19.15.2.5.  The following will apply when dropping two CRRC platforms on one pass:  (T-3) 17.19.15.2.5.1.  The forward release gate must be manually cut by the loadmaster.  (T-3) 17.19.15.2.5.2.  The second loadmaster must be positioned in  the paratroop door prior to completion of the ten-minute warning.  (T-3) 17.19.15.2.5.3.  NVG are required for the airdrop of two CRRC platforms on one pass at night.  (T-3) 17.19.15.3.  Rigging Alternate Method Zodiac.  The RAMZ consists of a deflated Zodiac F470  combat  rubber  raiding  craft.    The  RAMZ  engine  is  configured  in  a  plywood  box and secured in a standard A-22 container using two T-10 parachutes.  When rigged, the RAMZ package weighs between 600 and 1,000 pounds. 17.19.15.3.1.  Emergency Procedures.  Follow either the CDS emergency procedures or fouled parachutist procedures. 17.19.15.3.2.  Aircraft  Preparation.    Aircraft  preparation  will  be  in  accordance  with 1C-130J-9.    The  RAMZ  package  will  be  delivered  rigged  and  prepared  for  loading.  The  loadmaster  is  responsible  for  aircraft  rigging,  attaching  the  static  line,  and securing  the  package.    (T-3)    When  the  bundle  is  used  in  conjunction  with  SAR operations, it is not uncommon for the Special Tactics Squadron (STS) or Pararescue Jumper (PJ) team to require the flexibility to determine method of deployment (static line  or  MFF)  after  they  determine  weather  conditions  at  the  recovery  site.    In  this case,  the  loadmaster  should  prepare  the  aircraft  to  allow  for  either  option  and complete  all  bundle  rigging  with  the  exception  of  static  line  attachment.    In-flight prior  to  the  20  minute  warning,  the  team  along  with  the  crew  will  determine  the method of deployment.  (T3)  At this point, the loadmaster will attach the static line to the  appropriate  anchor  cable  and  comply  with  In-Flight  Rigging  Procedures.    (T-3)  The  package  is  rigged  and  dropped  using  normal  CDS  combination  procedures,  or rigged on the ramp using ramp bundle procedures. 17.19.15.3.3.  Deployment.    Checklist  items  up  to  and  including  the  six-minute advisory  may  be  accomplished  prior  to  identifying  the  target.    Accomplish  the slowdown using normal slowdown procedures.  (T-3) 17.19.15.3.4.  DZ  Axis.    If  possible,  the  DZ  axis  will  be  into  the  wind  (±  30°)  for MFF  drops  if  drop  altitude  wind  is  5  knots  or  greater.    The  jumpmaster  will  be   218  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 advised when this cannot be complied with.  Release for static line deployments can be either into the wind or downwind. 17.19.15.3.5.  Release  Point.    The  CSO  determines  the  release  point.    (T-3)    If  the bundle is rigged using ramp bundle procedures the loadmaster will manually cut the RAMZ  bundle  loose  which  will  signal  the  jumpers  they  are  clear  to  jump.    (T-3)  MFF  jumpers  will  exit  approximately  6  seconds  after  load  release.    Static  line jumpers  will  exit  immediately  after  the  load  release.    (T-3)        WARNING:    MFF jumpers will not exit until RAMZ static lines have been retrieved.  (T-3) 17.19.16.  Heavy  Equipment  Drops  (HE).    Only  equipment  rigged  in  accordance  with  TO 13C7 series and Field Manual 10-500 series or USSOCOM 350-series rigging manuals will be  airdropped.    Nonstandard  equipment  and  loads  require  specific  instructions  and  waivers from HQ AFSOC/A3V prior to airdrop.  (T-2) 17.19.17.  Door Bundle.  A7A or A-21 containers weighing up to 500 pounds are referred to as door bundles and may be dropped through the paratroop door or ramp and door using the personnel airdrop checklist.  Door bundles may be dropped independently or in conjunction with  personnel.    Bundle  airdrops  are  limited  to  one  bundle  per  paratroop  door.    When dropped  with  personnel,  the  bundle  will  be  the  first  object  to  exit  the  aircraft.    (T-3)    The maximum bundle size in inches is 66 (height) x 48 (width) x 30 (length) for paratroop door loads.  (T-3)  Joint airdrop inspection (JAI) is not required for door bundles. 17.19.17.1.  Paratroop  Doors  (Personnel  Checklist).    Remove  restraint  and  position  the bundle in the paratroop doors prior to completion of the Run-In checklist.  (T-3)  Ensure door bundles are not equipped with breakaway static lines.  (T-3) 17.19.17.2.  Ramp and Door: 17.19.17.2.1.  Door  Bundle  (Personnel  Checklist).    Door  bundles  dropped  off  the ramp  and  door  will  be  equipped  with  breakaway  static  lines  in  accordance  with  TO 13C7-1-11, or with parachutes packed in T-10 bags.  Door bundles dropped from the ramp and door that exceed the weight or dimensions specified in Paragraph 17.19.17 will be equipped with a skid board compatible with the intermediate roller conveyors. 17.19.17.2.2.  Ramp Bundle (Personnel or CDS Checklist).  Load dimensions will be in accordance with above referenced directives.  The total rigged weight  of the load will not exceed 2,335 lbs.  Ramp bundles will be rigged in accordance with TO 13C7-1-11, Field Manual 10-500, and USSOCOM 350-series directives and dropped as on-the-ramp  loads.    Remove  vertical  and  aft  restraint  at  the  10-minute  warning.    (T-3)  Remove forward restraint prior to the completion of the Run-In checklist.  (T-3)  The loads will be released by the loadmaster and may be followed by parachutists.  (T-3)  These  procedures  can  be  accomplished  from  either  side  of  the  cargo  ramp  or  from centerline.  Specific aircraft preparations and rigging procedures are contained in TO 1C-130J-9. 17.19.17.2.3.  Release  Point.    When  door/ramp  bundles  are  dropped  with  personnel, compute a personnel CARP.  (T-3)  Compute an additional CARP for the door bundle and plot the vectors from  the personnel  release  point to  ensure it will impact  within the  DZ  boundaries.    (T-3)    Release  the  bundle  at  the  personnel  CARP,  followed  by the  parachutists  when  the  door  is  clear.    (T-3)    An  alternate  procedure  is  to  add  the AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   219  exit time of the bundle to the personnel  CARP, and release the bundle at  this point, followed by the jumpers.   If this method is  used, the crew must coordinate with  the user to ensure the load lands at the desired location.  When a door bundle is the only object being dropped, base the release on the CARP for the bundle.  (T-3) 17.19.17.3.  Only equipment rigged in accordance with TO 13C7-series and Field Manual 10500  series  or  USSOCOM  350-series  rigging  manuals,  properly  marked  with  accurate weights and shipper’s declarations will be airdropped.  Nonstandard equipment and loads require specific instructions and waivers from HQ AFSOC/A3V.  (T-2) 17.19.18.  Joint Precision Airdrop System Procedures. 17.19.18.1.  The  term  JPADS  refers  to  GPS-guided  equipment,  Improved  Container Delivery  System  (I-CDS)  and  MFF  airdrops  that  utilize  the  JPADS  Mission  Planner (JPADS-MP) system. 17.19.18.2.  JPADS  Restrictions.    Wind  data  derived  from  the  JPADS  four  dimensional wind  model  is  suitable  for  mission  use,  but  the  JPADS-MP  does  not  calculate  MFF HARP correctly.  AFSOC crews will not use JPADS-MP as the sole source for personnel MFF HARP calculations until authorized.  (T-3)  Aircrews will use sound judgment and evaluate  the  dropsonde  derived  winds,  forecasted  winds,  and  preflight  HARP  location before conducting MFF operations.  (T-3) 17.19.18.3.  JPADS  certified  aircrews  are  authorized  to  use  the  JPADS-MP  laptop  and software (a stand-alone system) to calculate release points for JPADS operations. 17.19.18.3.1.  MFF airdrops only, aircrews can input dropsonde collected winds into onboard airdrop systems, utilize the Air Force Weather Agency forecast/model during mission planning, and incorporate dropsonde collected winds when calculating HARP in AFSOC approved airdrop planning software for personnel. 17.19.18.3.2.  The  collected  winds  may  be  entered  into  the  wind/temperature summary  layer  for  use  in  HARP  calculation.    Note:    JPADS  winds  are  collected  in magnetic  or  true  so  winds  may  require  conversion  to  true  before  entry  into  mission computers. 17.19.18.4.  JPADS  certified  crews  are  authorized  JPADS  airdrop  operations  in  VMC and  IMC  above  3,000  feet  AGL  without  the  use  of  a  Radar  Beacon  or  Ground  Radar Aerial Delivery System (GRADS). 17.19.18.5.  Drop zone size criteria during contingency operations are at the discretion of the user.  Ultimately, the user accepts responsibility for the accuracy and the condition of these airdrop loads. 17.19.18.6.  The  planned  release  point  for  actual  JPADS  training  airdrops  must  be executed within the lateral and vertical limits of a restricted area.  (T-3) 17.19.18.7.  During the dropsonde release, use of  zero flaps at  speeds between 170–180 KIAS  is  required to  preclude dropsonde tail  strikes.   (T-3)   Loadmasters  should release the dropsondes from the corners of the cargo ramp.   220  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 17.19.18.8.  Surface  Wind  Limits.    Surface  wind  limitations  are  unrestricted  for dropsonde operations, 18 knots for Firefly, Screamer, and Dragonfly and as published for all other parachutes. 17.19.18.9.  Altitude Restrictions.  (T-3) 17.19.18.9.1.  I-CDS/JPADS:  Maximum altitude 25,000 ft MSL.  (T-3) 17.19.18.9.2.  SCREAMER minimum drop altitude is 8,000 ft AGL.  (T-3) 17.19.18.9.3.  FIREFLY minimum drop altitude is 5,000 ft AGL.  (T-3) 17.19.18.9.4.  Dropsonde minimum drop altitude is 3,000 ft AGL.  (T-3) 17.19.18.10.  For all training drops the dropsonde will be planned to land in the intended impact/drop  area  using  the  release  point  determined  by  the  JPADS-MP.    (T-3)    The planned release point will be programmed in the CNI-MU into the mission computer as a normal (non-drop) leg.  (T-3)  Aircraft position will be confirmed either by GPS with a Figure(s) of Merit (FOM) of 3 or better or via aircraft sensor updates.  (T-3) 17.19.18.11.  Equipment  Drops.    CSO  will  program  the  planned  release  point  into  the mission computer as a normal (non-drop) leg.  (T-3)  Aircraft position will be confirmed either by GPS with a FOM of 3 or better or via aircraft sensor updates.  (T-3)  For non-GPS  guided  drops  CSOs  will  validate  the  JPADS-MP  release  point  via  normal  CARP procedures.  (T-3) 17.19.18.11.1.  A  drop  leg  may  be  used  with  SONDE  derived  winds  for  unguided JPADS  equipment  drops  where  parachute  ballistic  data  is  listed  in  accordance  with AFI 11-231, Computed  Air Release Point Procedures.  Aircrew will ensure that the aircraft  calculated  release  point  falls  within  the  JPADS  mission  planner  calculated LAR.  (T-3) 17.19.19.  Low  Cost  Aerial  Delivery  System  (LCADS):    The  Low  Cost  Aerial  Delivery System  is  a  one-time  use,  stand-alone  airdrop  system  consisting  of  a  modular  suite  of  low cost airdrop items, and be comprised of parachutes, containers, platforms, and other air items configured for low-velocity, high-velocity, and free fall-drop aerial delivery of loads. 17.19.20.  Low Cost Aerial Delivery System-Low Velocity (LCADS-LV).  Use CDS airdrop checklists and flap settings.  (T-3) 17.19.20.1.  LCADS-LV  Ballistics.    LCADS-LV  will  be  dropped  using  the  ballistics IAW  AFI  11-231  or  published  Air  Transportability  Test  Loading  Agency  (ATTLA) memorandum.    Exit  times  will  be  IAW  AFI  11-231,  Computed  Air  Release  Point Procedures. 17.19.20.1.1.  Drop  Zone  Size.    The  drop  zone  size  will  be  IAW  AFI  13-217,  Drop Zone  and  Landing  Zone  Operations.    The  minimum  reliable  drop  altitude  is  1,000 feet  AGL  (drops  below  800  feet  AGL  pose  a  significant  risk  of  failure  or  damage).  The  maximum  drop  altitude  is  13,000  feet  MSL  (drops  above  10,000  feet  MSL  are restricted to a maximum of 1,700 lbs suspended weight).  (T-3) 17.19.20.2.  Low  Cost  Aerial  Delivery  System-High  Velocity  (LCADS-HV).    Use  CDS airdrop checklists and flap settings.  (T-3) AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   221  17.19.20.2.1.  LCADS-HV  is  not  authorized  for  training  use.    LCADS-HV  is authorized  for  contingency  missions  and  developmental/Developmental  Test  and Evaluation/(OT&E) missions. 17.19.20.2.2.  For  JPADS  qualified  crews,  LCADS-HV  is  currently  included  in  the JPADS  mission  planner.    When  using  the  JPADS  mission  planner  to  compute  an  I-CDS  release  point  and  utilizing  LCADS-HV  parachutes,  ensure  the  chute  type selected is “LCADSHV”.  (T-3) 17.19.20.2.3.  Minimum reliable drop altitude is 3,000 feet AGL.  IAW AFI 13-217, Paragraph  2.3,  drop  altitudes  below  3,000  AGL  may  be  required  due  to contingency/wartime  operations.    If  supported  and  supporting  forces  commanders require a drop altitude lower than 3,000 feet AGL, the drop altitude will be no lower than  1,800  feet  AGL.    (T-3)    This  absolute  minimum  drop  altitude  is  based  on historical success rates and recommendations by ballistics experts at NATICK. 17.19.20.2.4.  Maximum drop altitude is 25,000 feet MSL.  (T-3) 17.19.20.3.  Low Cost Aerial Delivery System-Low-Altitude (LCLA).  Use CDS airdrop checklists and 50% flap setting.  (T-3) 17.19.20.3.1.  LCLA  is  one  of  the  Army's  low  cost  airdrop  systems.    LCLA  was designed  to  provide  very  low-altitude  aerial  resupply  using  small  fixed  wing  and rotary wing aircraft.  LCLA is similar to the low cost airdrop system in that it is new low  cost  equipment,  but  LCLA  does  not  have  the  same  airdrop  parameters  as  low velocity  (LCADS-LV)  or  high  velocity  (LCADS-HV).    LCLA  was  designed  to provide  very  low-altitude  (150  -  300  feet  AGL)  aerial  resupply  using  small  fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft.  LCLA parachutes are compatible with A-7A/Low cost polypropylene straps, and A-21  containers.   Containers may  be  rigged with  a single parachute or with clusters of up to three parachutes. 17.19.20.3.2.  Aircrews  are  authorized  to  conduct  LCLA  airdrops  during  exercises, unilateral training, and contingency operations. 17.19.20.3.3.  All AFSOC C-130J variants will conduct LCLA airdrops at 130 KIAS using  personnel/container  ramp  load  checklist  procedures.    (T-3)    (Exceptions:    1.  Use 50% flaps for all LCLA drops.  (T-2)  Position anchor cable stops at FS 803.  (T-3) 17.19.20.3.4.  Surface  wind  limits  for  LCLA  drops  is  18  KTS.   Surface  wind  above this limit is at the discretion of supported unit commander. 17.19.20.3.5.  LCLA  drop  altitude  will  be  no  lower  than  150  feet  AGL  during  the day.    (T-3)    The  minimum  night  drop  altitude  is  300  feet.    (T-3)    Descent  to  drop altitude  will  begin  no  earlier  than  the  IP.    Situation  permitting,  notify  the  user  if airdropping above the expected LCLA altitude range (150-300 feet AGL). 17.19.20.3.6.  If the ramp cannot accommodate the number or weight of bundles to be dropped in one pass, rig and drop from the cargo floor using standard CDS checklists and rigging procedures.  (T-3)  Use the LCLA ballistic data from section 4A with the CDS exit times listed in AFI 11231.  Manual gate release is authorized. 17.20.  Receiver Air-to-Air Refueling.  Conduct IAW TO 1C-130(E)J-1 and ATP-56(B).   222  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 17.20.1.  Communication.    Unless  directed  otherwise  by  a  specific  exercise  operations order/plan, or during contingencies, communication capability between tankers and receivers will be maintained during all normal rendezvous and air refueling operations.  (T-3)  Voice transmissions  will  be  IAW  the  emission  control option  used.        CAUTION:    Air  refueling operations will not be conducted when radio communications capability between the tanker and receiver is lost, except during emergency fuel situation.  (T-3)  If radio communications are  lost,  or  unreadable  between  the  boom  operator  and  receiver  pilot,  contacts  will  not  be attempted.  (T-3) 17.20.2.  Use  manual  boom  latching  procedures  only  during  fuel  emergencies  and contingency operations.  (T-3)  Exception:  Manual boom latching procedures are authorized for all refueling operations with the KC-10 if the tanker's independent disconnect system is operational. 17.20.3.  Altitude Reservations (ALTRV).  Whenever practical, refueling operations are done on  tracks  or  anchor  areas  published  in  the  DoD  FLIP.    ALTRVs  are  used  when  certain missions  or  operational  considerations  may  require  air  refueling  operations  in  areas  not published in FLIP.  For specific ALTRV procedures, refer to FLIP and FAA Special Military Operations 7610.4H, 3. 17.20.4.  Special  Operations  Air  Refueling  (SOAR)  Procedures. 33.E/MC130J for specific procedures.   Refer  to  AFTTP AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   223  Chapter 18 LEAFLET AIRDROP 18.1.  General.  Leaflet airdrops are accomplished in both hostile and permissive environments. 18.2.  Mission  Description.  Mission  requirements  vary  widely  depending  on  the  volume  of leaflets  airdropped,  leaflet  packaging,  and  the  altitude  of  the  airdrop.    Loads  will  normally  not exceed 25,000 pounds.  Drop altitudes may vary from 500 ft AGL to the aircraft service ceiling.  Leaflet  drops  require  the  movement  of  boxes  of  various  weights  from  throughout  the  cargo compartment via intermediate rollers (if required) to the ramp area for dispersal off the ramp.  If specific  mission  requirements  dictate  deviation  from  information  contained  in  this  publication, modify procedures to  meet  specific requirements.   Note:  All  airdrops conducted above FL250 require a waiver to AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  Long duration high altitude drops will require the aircraft remain open.  Consider outside air temperature and clothing requirements prior to step.  (T-2) 18.3.  Equipment.  In  addition  to  normal  aircraft  equipment,  the  following  items  may  be required to perform leaflet drops: 18.3.1.  Parachutes  or  restraining  harnesses  must  be  available  for  use  by  all  personnel working in the cargo compartment.  (T-3)  Normally six are required. 18.3.2.  A portable oxygen console with a minimum of four regulators and output hoses with sufficient length to reach throughout the entire cargo compartment must be available for high altitude airdrops (above 10,000 feet). 18.3.3.  An  interval  timer  is  desirable  (alternating  red  and  green  jump  lights  may  serve  for sequencing the drops). 18.4.  Aircraft  Configuration.  Determine  if  leaflets  are  floor  loaded  (on  aircraft  dual  rail intermediate conveyors) or are configured on pallets.  Based on how the leaflets are prepared and the volume of leaflets to airdrop, there are several possible configurations. 18.4.1.  Palletized Loads.  Preload large volumes of leaflets on pallets and load as palletized cargo.    Resources  permitting,  this  is  the  recommended  procedure  for  large  volumes  of leaflets. 18.4.1.1.  Use modified pallets with warehouse rollers attached to the top of the pallets in two sticks. 18.4.1.2.  Stack  the  leaflet  boxes  on  the  pallets  in  two  sticks  and  secure  them  to  the pallets before loading aircraft. 18.4.1.3.  In addition to the modified pallets, provide a bridge to span the gap between the last floor pallet and the ramp pallet. 18.4.1.3.1.  Construct the bridge so the rollers on it are the same height as the rollers on top of the pallets when loaded on the aircraft dual rails (EC-130J). 18.4.1.3.2.  Install  the  bridge  after  the  ramp  is  lowered  to  the  airdrop  position  and before completion of the slowdown or 3-minute checklist.   224  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 18.4.2.  Floor  Loads.    Leaflets  may  also  be  loaded  directly  on  the  aircraft  intermediate conveyors,  if  available.    Employ  this  procedure  for  smaller  loads  of  leaflets  or  when  the equipment mentioned above is not available. 18.4.2.1.  Individual boxes have to be hand loaded and each group of boxes individually secured using aircraft tie-down equipment. 18.4.2.2.  Configure the aircraft IAW the applicable volume and addenda. 18.4.2.2.1.  Recommend  the  intermediate  conveyors  be  moved  inboard  to  the  high speed configuration if size of the load permits. 18.4.2.2.2.  If the intermediate conveyors must remain in the outboard configuration, exercise care during loading to ensure the individual boxes contact two intermediate rollers.    The  boxes  may  not  roll  or  may  be  damaged  if  loaded  on  only  one  roller conveyor. 18.4.2.2.2.1.  If  the  intermediate  conveyors  must  remain  in  the  outboard configuration,  consider  using  CDS  skid  boards  or  sheets  of  plywood  as  skids under the leaflet boxes. 18.4.2.2.2.2.  If  using  this  option,  secure  each  skid  of  leaflets  individually  using aircraft tie-down equipment. 18.4.2.2.2.3.  Drift each skid back to the ramp hinge during the airdrop, exercising caution not to let the skid board exit the aircraft. 18.4.2.2.2.4.  Secure  the  empty  skids  against  the  side  wall  until  the  airdrop  is completed. 18.5.  Preparation for Loading.  Complete applicable portions of the appropriate TO 1C-130J-9 checklists as follows: 18.5.1.  Cargo Loading Preparation. 18.5.2.  Cargo Loading (Palletized/Floor Load). 18.5.3.  General Airplane Preparation for Ramp and Door Airdrop/Extraction. 18.5.4.  Anchor Cables.  Rig one anchor cable on each side of the aircraft. 18.5.4.1.  Attach the aft latch of each anchor cable to the inboard U-bolt on the aft anchor cable support on each side of the airplane. 18.5.4.2.  Position  the anchor cable stops to  the very forward or  aft end of the cable, or remove and stow the stops, unless they are used as stops for the restraint harness restraint strap. 18.5.4.3.  Attach  the  forward  latch  to  the  center  U-bolts  on  the  forward  anchor  cable support. 18.5.4.3.1.  If the center U-bolts are not  accessible because of aircraft configuration, attach the forward latch to the outboard U-bolts. 18.5.4.3.2.  If  connecting  the  forward  latch  to  the  outboard  U-bolts,  leave  additional slack in the cable to allow anchor cable installation in the outboard location on the A-frame during the airdrop. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   225  18.5.4.3.3.  Lower  the  center  anchor  cable  supports  and  lock  them  in  the  vertical position with  the tubular supports.  Do not  connect  the anchor  cable to  the A-frame during  rigging.    The  cable  may  block  the  cargo  door  from  properly  opening  and closing. 18.5.4.3.4.  The  aft  anchor  cable  support  arm  micro  switches  should  be  isolated  so that the cargo ramp will operate with the anchor cables lowered. 18.5.4.3.4.1.  Isolate  the  micro  switches  by  securing  them  back  with  1/4-inch cotton webbing or gutted Type III nylon. 18.5.4.3.4.2.  Test the ramp for operation with the micro switches secured and the anchor cables lowered to ensure the ties were properly installed. 18.5.5.  Static  Line  Retrievers.    Suspend  oxygen  hoses  from  static  line  retriever  cables  for high altitude missions (not required if airdropping below 10,000 feet MSL). 18.5.5.1.  Unwind static line retriever cable(s). 18.5.5.2.  Install quick disconnects on the aft end of cable(s). 18.5.5.3.  Secure the quick disconnects to the inboard side of the A-frame with two turns of  1/4inch  cotton  webbing.    Make  this  tie  approximately  18  inches  above  the  anchor cable  attaching  point.    If  the  static  line  retriever  is  inadvertently  rewound,  the  tie  will break and will prevent damage to the A-frame or static line retriever. 18.5.5.4.  Remove all slack from static line retriever cables. 18.5.6.  Oxygen  Hoses  and  Interphone  Cord.    Tape  or  tie  extended  oxygen  hoses  and interphone  cords  together  and  suspend  from  static  line  retriever  cables  with  G-13  clevis  or suitable substitute. 18.5.6.1.  Ensure that approximately 12 G-13 clevises or suitable substitutes are available to tie oxygen hoses to the static line retriever cable(s). 18.5.6.2.  Recommend the kicker use the oxygen regulator and interphone cord aft of the left paratroop door.  Route the cord and hose up and over the overhead structural beams, and  back  down  next  to  the  overhead  ADS  release.    This  technique  keeps  the  hose  and cord off the floor preventing them from  becoming tangled or damaged.   It also  keeps it out of the kicker's way while kicking boxes and retrieving static lines. 18.6.  Securing Boxes.  Secure five boxes on the ramp for airdrop.  If loading preloaded pallets, two sticks of five boxes each, are secured on the ramp pallet. 18.7.  Connecting Static Lines.  Connect static lines to the anchor cable aft of the A-frame. 18.8.  Restraint  Strapping.  Place a single length of Type III nylon, as final restraint, over the stick of boxes.  The cargo restraint strap over the boxes on the ramp is removed at the 1-minute warning.  The Type III nylon final restraint is cut at the release point.   226  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Figure 18.1.  Leaflet Box Rigging Procedures. 18.9.  Leaflet  Box  Rigging  Procedures.  Rigging  boxes dissemination. for  high-altitude  static line  18.9.1.  Using a punch, cut four holes approximately 2 1/2 inches by 3/4 inches as indicated in Figure  21.1.   If a punch is not available, a knife can be used.  When using a punch, the box  must  first  be  placed  upon  an  object  slightly  deeper  and  smaller  than  the  box  so  that  a hard surface is provided when striking the punch. 18.9.2.  Cut through the box from one hole to another as illustrated in Figure 21.1. 18.9.3.  Place  a  2-inch  wide  length  of  webbing  through  the  holes.    The  length  of  webbing depends upon the size of the box, but must be long enough to tie after the box has been filled with leaflets. 18.9.4.  Place a 3 or 4-inch strip of masking tape over the 2-inch wide webbing. 18.9.5.  Cut all four corners of the box from the top to about 3/4  of the way down (or less). 18.9.6.  Again  using  masking  tape,  tape  one  strip  up  the  cut  portion  and  two  across,  as illustrated. 18.9.7.  After filling the box with leaflets, tie the two strips of webbing. 18.9.8.  Attach  one  end  of  the  static  line  to  the  webbing  ties.    The  length  of  the  static  line depends upon the type of aircraft, but it is normally about 15 feet long.  The box is rolled out AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   227  of  the  aircraft  and  as  the  container  comes  to  the  end  of  the  static  line,  the  sides  of  the  box split.  In effect, it is turned inside out.  The leaflets fall away followed by the empty box. 18.9.9.  This  is  one  method,  and  may  not  be  the  method  suited  for  your  mission.    Other variations do exist; however, this is the most universal and least complex. 18.10.  Preparation  for  Airdrop.  After  takeoff,  take  the  following  actions  before  starting  the leaflet airdrop checklist. 18.10.1.  Tape all ramp control panel switches, except the auxiliary pump and ramp switch. 18.10.2.  Lower  anchor  cables  and  connect  them  to  the  outboard  side  of  the  anchor  cable supports. 18.10.3.  Safety tie the aft anchor cable support micro switches. 18.10.4.  Position/don emergency equipment and survival gear. 18.10.5.  Begin Leaflet Airdrop checklist. 18.11.  Aircrew  Procedures.  Under  normal  circumstances  the  crew  required  for  leaflet operations consists of a tactical crew plus two Physiological Technician(s) (PT) (for high altitude airdrops) and three additional crew members to act as feeders.  The senior loadmaster will assign specific positions for activity in the cargo compartment.  (T-3) 18.11.1.  Drop  Configuration/Maneuvering.    Base  configuration  on  desired  coverage  and airframe  airspeed  limitations.    (T-3)    All  personnel  should  be  constantly  aware  of  the possibility of an emergency break upon encountering a threat. 18.11.1.1.  Flaps.  Flaps are normally set at 50% and flap settings should not be changed during  the  drop  unless  the  loadmaster  is  notified.    Note:    At  very  high  altitudes,  the aircraft  may  not  be  able  to  maintain  drop  airspeed  with  50%  flaps.    Under  these conditions, use an intermediate flap setting that allows for aircraft performance and also produces an acceptable deck angle for the drop.  A flap setting near 20% gives the best aircraft wing performance while providing high rudder boost for controllability. 18.12.  Static Lines.  To increase speed of closing the ramp if a hostile threat is detected and to prevent damage to the aircraft, the static lines should be stowed after each box goes out.  Do this if the interval between boxes permits safe operation.  Static lines may be cut in an emergency.   228  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Chapter 19 SEARCH AND RESCUE PROCEDURES 19.1.  General.  Most searches are part of an effort to save life; therefore, make every effort to complete  the  search  as  rapidly  and  efficiently  as  possible.    A  thorough  scan  of  the  search  area and accurate navigation significantly increase the probability of detection.  Reactions to sightings must  be  timely  and  accurate.    This  section  outlines  operational  procedures  for  conducting effective  searches  in  the  C-130  aircraft.    Refer  to  the  International  Aeronautical  and  Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) Volumes I/II for additional information. 19.1.1.  Search  and  Rescue  Satellite-Aided  Tracking  (SARSAT).  SARSAT  is  an international satellite system for SAR.  It consists of a constellation of seven satellites in low earth orbit, 5 geostationary satellites and a network of earth stations, which provide distress alert  and  location  information  to  appropriate  rescue  authorities  anywhere  in  the  world  for users in distress.  The SARSAT satellites detect beacons broadcasting on 406.025 Megahertz (MHz).    The  current  SARSAT  system  consists  of  64  Local  User  Terminals  (LUT)  and  26 Mission  Control  Centers  in  32  countries,  including  12  in  the  United  States.    SARSAT coverage  on  406  MHz  is  world-wide.    The  Rescue  Coordination  Center  (RCC)  at  Langley AFB,  VA,  maintains  one  deployable  LUT  (camper  sized,  air  transportable  van)  to  provide contingency coverage. Table 19.1.

Search Altitude (Table 19  7).  Select an optimum search altitude based upon the object of  search,  weather  in  the  search  area,  electronic  or  visual  location  aids  used,  and  any  other known factor, which  would  affect  the search  altitude.  Generally, the lower the search altitude, the  better  the  chance  of  seeing  an  object,  provided  the  altitude  is  not  so  low  that  the  aircraft speed  becomes  detrimental.    During  preliminary  searches,  the  altitude  will  be  higher  to  detect possible signals at greater distances. 19.3.  Search Procedures. 19.3.1.  Rescue  missions  often  involve  commitment  based  upon  calculated  risks.    Give  full consideration to all safety factors.  (T-3)  Timely reaction to all search missions is essential to the safety of personnel or equipment.  Do not jeopardize safety by inadequate preparation or short cuts to expedite takeoff, or arrival at search areas.  Aircrews will comply with all other applicable technical orders and Air Force Instructions, which govern their duties:  (T-2) 19.3.1.1.  Accomplish  complete  pre-departure  flight  planning  except  for  scramble missions.    (T3)    On  scramble  missions,  complete  essential  flight  planning  prior  to  and shortly after takeoff.  (T3) 19.3.1.2.  Use in-flight procedures in accordance with the appropriate theater of operation flight regulations.  (T3) 19.3.1.2.1.  Aircraft  will  maintain  vertical  and  horizontal  separation  in  the  search area.  (T3)  This is critical when several aircraft are searching within close proximity. Table 19.7.

Discuss  the  preparation  of  flares,  sea  dyes,  and  smoke  signals  for deployment with the loadmaster.  (T3) 19.3.2.3.6.  Discuss the preparation of personnel and equipment for airborne delivery with  the  loadmaster  and  pararescuemen.    (T3)    Ensure  all  crew  members  are thoroughly  familiar  with  the  checklists  to  be  used  for  various  airborne  delivery options.  (T3) 19.3.2.4.  The  PIC  will  coordinate  crew  member  activities  during  prosecution  of  the search by:  (T3) 19.3.2.4.1.  Ensuring  completion  of  the  Search  Checklist  prior  to  commencing  any low-level search.  (T3) 19.3.2.4.2.  Alerting  the  scanners  to  begin  scanning  when  approaching  the  search area.  (T3) 19.3.2.4.3.  Directing crew members to put on their LPUs prior to  descending below 2,000 feet overwater.  (T3) 19.3.2.4.4.  Checking with crew members to  ensure all equipment  and personnel  are ready for action in the event of a sighting.  (T3) 19.3.2.4.5.  Making  periodic  checks  of  fuel  remaining  to  ensure  sufficient  fuel remains for return to home station.  (T3) AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   233  19.3.2.5.  Report  all  deviations  from  assigned  search  procedures  to  the  on-scene commander or mission commander.  (T3) 19.3.2.6.  Thoroughly  investigate  sightings  and  report  findings  immediately.    Initiate recovery  action  or  assistance  when  the  survivors  are  located  and  inform  appropriate agencies of the progress.  (T3) 19.3.2.7.  The CSO will:  (T3) 19.3.2.7.1.  Maintain an accurate record of area searched.  (T3) 19.3.2.7.2.  Direct the aircraft to ensure proper coverage of the search area.  (T3) 19.3.2.7.3.  Continually  cross-check  headings,  drift,  time,  airspeed,  and  altitude  to maintain the best possible search coverage.  (T3) 19.3.2.7.4.  Use  a  large-scale  chart  when  searching  over  land  to  ensure  terrain  and obstacle clearance.  Use a search pattern graph as a suitable reference while searching overwater.  (T3) 19.3.2.7.5.  Record sighting information on log and plot position on navigation chart.  (T3) 19.3.2.7.6.  Monitor equipment during radar and electronic searches.  (T3) 19.3.2.7.7.  Debrief  controlling  agency  with  an  accurate  depiction  of  any  areas searched.  (T3) 19.3.2.7.8.  When other aircraft are involved, track and assign search areas for other aircraft.  (T3) 19.3.2.8.  The  PIC  will  insure  radio  communications  are  maintained  with  other  search aircraft and the controlling agency.  (T3) 19.3.2.9.  The  loadmaster  will  assume  supervision  of  the  scanners  and  will  schedule rotation and rest periods.  Scanners should be rotated every 30 to 45 minutes of scanning and rested after two hours, if enough scanners are available.  (T3) 19.3.2.10.  All crew members will assist with the scanning duties when possible.  (T3) 19.3.2.11.  When a search is completed with negative results, consider searching the area again.  Normally, position subsequent search legs between or 45° to the previous search legs.  This procedure, in effect, results in smaller track spacing. 19.3.3.  In the search area:  (T3) 19.3.3.1.  Descend to search altitude (Table 19.7).  (T3) 19.3.3.2.  Have  CSO  obtain  the  wind  at  search  altitude    (T3)    o  visually  cover  the  area thoroughly,  slow  the  airspeed  during  search  patterns  (refer  to  the  Aircraft  Performance Manual).  (T3) 19.3.3.3.  Notify ATC of arrival on scene and estimated endurance.  (T3) 19.3.3.4.  Vector other aircraft to the scene.  (T3) 19.3.3.5.  Use radar (some life rafts carry reflectors).  (T3)   234  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 19.3.3.6.  Assume  on-scene  command  until  relieved  by  another  duly  appointed  SAR aircraft.  (T3)  As other aircraft arrive, do the following:  (T3) 19.3.3.6.1.  Establish contact on channels other than Guard.  (T3) 19.3.3.6.2.  Obtain aircraft type identification, endurance, and rescue capability.  (T3) 19.3.3.6.3.  Assign  altimeter  setting,  frequencies,  search  areas,  patterns,  and  altitude separation.  (T3) 19.3.3.7.  If leaving the search area because of lack of fuel, assign another aircraft as on-scene commander.  (T3) 19.3.4.  Determine  an  accurate  wind  prior  to  and  throughout  the  search.    (T3)    Use  Table 19.9 to estimate wind velocity near the surface. 19.3.5.  When  flying  search  patterns,  turns  must  be  accurate  and  uniform  as  possible.    The following procedures are provided to assist the aircrew in making precise turns: 19.3.5.1.  Fly the aircraft on autopilot when possible. 19.3.5.2.  Prior  to  starting  the  pattern,  the  CSO  will  brief  the  crew  on  the  direction  and rate of turn and the turn command procedure used. 19.3.5.3.  Normally, all turns are standard rate (3° per second) unless track spacing is less in  distance  than  the  diameter  of  a  standard  turn  at  a  given  speed.    In  this  situation, continue turn to 180° and adjust turn rate as required to remain within the pattern. Table 19.8.  Sector Search Pattern Computation.

If survivors are in life jackets, make attempts as soon as possible to furnish them with life rafts or other survival equipment and signaling devices. 19.3.5.5.  Direct  potential  rescue  or  recovery  vessels  and  other  aircraft  to  the  scene  by radio  or  visual  signals.    Radio  and  visual  signals  you  may  use  to  direct  a  vessel  to  the scene to include: 19.3.5.6.  Radio message to the vessel. 19.3.5.6.1.  ADF to take bearings on a vessel's Low Frequency or Medium Frequency (MF) transmissions.   236  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 19.3.5.6.2.

Pyrotechnic flares. 19.3.5.6.7.  When radio communications are not possible, establish self-identification, then indicate location of the target by: 19.3.5.6.7.1.  Circling the vessel at least once at low-altitude. 19.3.5.6.7.2.  Flying across the bow of the vessel at least once, and rocking wings at the same time. 19.3.5.6.7.3.  Sending  a  message  by  signal  light  or  dropping  a  message,  if possible. 19.3.5.6.7.4.  Heading  in  the  direction  of  the  target.    Repeat  this  procedure  until the vessel acknowledges by following the aircraft, or indicates that it is unable to comply  by  hoisting  the  International  Flag,  November  (the  International  Flag, November,  is  a  blue  and  white  checkerboard).    Crossing  the  wake  of  the  vessel close  astern  at  a  low-altitude  means  that  the  service  of  the  vessel  to  which  the signal is directed is no longer required. 19.3.5.7.  In daytime, use any of the following means to inform survivors they have been sighted: 19.3.5.7.1.  Fly low over survivors with landing lights on. 19.3.5.7.2.  Blink a signal light in the direction of survivors. 19.3.5.7.3.  Drop two marker signals a few seconds apart. 19.3.5.8.  Aircrews sighting survivors at night should: 19.3.5.8.1.  Mark  the  position  by  dropping  marker  smoke  or  strobe  lights  with floatation collars. 19.3.5.8.2.  Request assistance from other search aircraft or ships. 19.3.5.8.2.1.  If a rescue vessel arrives in the area, direct it to the scene by giving the target position in relation to the float light.  Drop parachute flares to assist the rescue or recovery vessel in sighting the target. 19.3.5.8.2.2.  If  the  objective  has  not  been  located,  but  its  position  is  fairly  well established, drop two strobe lights or datum marker buoys to outline the limits of the  search  area,  the  most  probable  position  of  target  being  halfway  between  the lights.  Start the search from one light to the other, dropping parachute flares for illumination. 19.3.5.8.2.3.  If no surface vessel is available, but two aircraft are on-scene, have one aircraft fly over the area at 3,000 feet dropping flares at 2 or 3-mile intervals.  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   237  Station the other aircraft 3 miles behind the illuminating aircraft, slightly upwind at 500 feet to search. 19.4.  Departing Search Area. 19.4.1.  Notify  ATC  and  the  appropriate  SAR  agency  on-scene,  SAR  aircraft,  Rescue Coordination Center, etc.  (T3) 19.4.2.  If  other  search  aircraft  have  not  arrived,  reconfirm  position,  and  advise  survivors when further assistance will arrive, if known.  (T3) 19.5.  Rescue  Airdrops.  Rescue  airdrops  of  rescue  equipment  allow  rapid  deployment  of  Sea Rescue  Kits,  pyrotechnics,  emergency  equipment,  etc.,  in  an  unplanned  and  rapidly  changing environment.    An  example  would  be  dropping  a  Sea  Rescue  Kit  to  a  helicopter  that  ditched during  helicopter  air  refueling.    Specific  patterns  are  Sea  Rescue  Kit  deployments  and  Para-bundle and Freefall equipment drops. 19.5.1.  The pilot will always brief the pattern and delivery to be flown.  (T3) 19.5.1.1.  As  a  minimum,  brief  the  type  of  equipment  to  be  delivered,  delivery  method (pattern shape, relationship to wind, etc.), altitudes, airspeeds, commands to be used, and required actions for malfunctions.  (T3) 19.5.2.  Sea  Rescue  Kit  Deployment.    The  Sea  Rescue  Kit  is  designed  to  meet  conditions, which require aerial delivery of emergency floatation and survival gear.  The kit is dropped free-fall  and  abeam  during  a  crosswind  pass  over  the  target.    When  correctly  dropped,  a straight line is formed on the water with an inflated raft at each end.  After delivery, the two rafts  with  their  high  freeboard  will  begin  to  drift  downwind  until  retarded  by  the  partially submerged supply containers.  Thus, when the kit is properly deployed, wind conditions will cause the kit to form a "U", partially encircling the target. 19.5.2.1.  Surface wind will affect the kit and target in varying amounts in proportion to the  area  exposed  above  the  water  and  displacement  below  the  water.    The  kit  will  drift faster  than  nearly  all-seagoing  vessels  (outboards,  cabin  cruisers,  trawlers,  heavy displacement deep draft vessels, and 1 man life rafts) but slower than a 6, 7, or 20-man raft.  If a kit drifts faster, it will be delivered upwind.  If the target drifts faster, the kit will be delivered downwind.  When the surface wind is less than 15 knots, the delivery pass will be offset approximately 50 feet.  (T3)  Distance will be increased 25 feet for each 10 knots in excess of the 15-knot base.  (T3)  Exception:  Downwind kit drops will always be offset approximately 50 feet.  (T3)  Do not correct for wind.  (T3) 19.5.2.2.  When deploying a Sea Rescue Kit in high winds, the kit may be deployed with the rafts deflated to improve drop accuracy.  See  Paragraph 19.11.2 for special rigging instructions. 19.5.2.3.  Pyrotechnics  may  be  useful  in  determining  wind  strength  and  direction,  and maintaining pattern orientation. 19.5.2.4.  Standard Sea Rescue Kit Pattern Procedures (Figure 19.10). 19.5.2.4.1.  Maneuver  the  aircraft  onto  a  flight  path  that  is  crosswind  and approximately 50 feet from the target on the side opposite to that of the intended kit delivery.  (T3)  Maintain drop altitude and airspeed.  (T3)   238  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Figure 19.2.  Standard Sea Rescue Kit Pattern.  19.5.2.4.2.  When abeam the target, begin the count (use seconds).  Two seconds past the target, release a smoke marker (if available).  The PF will count over interphone, "One thousand one, one thousand drop".  On the command of "drop", the loadmaster will manually launch a smoke marker.  (T3) 19.5.2.4.3.  Maintain  heading  for  10  seconds  and  drop  second  timing  signal  (if available).  Turn 45° to the right and hold that heading for 15 seconds.  Make a 180° left-hand standard rate turn.  Adjust turn to final so as to pass upwind or downwind of the target (as required for the delivery).  Distance will vary with the type of target and wind  velocity.    Rolling  out,  the  pilot  will  notify  the  crew:    "30  seconds  to  target".  (T3) 19.5.2.4.4.  Approximately  10  seconds  from  the  smoke  marker,  the  pilot  will  notify crew:    "10  seconds".    Just  prior  to  abeam  the  smoke  marker,  the  PF  will  command "Ready", and then abeam the marker, "Drop".  (T3)   Note:  Aircraft without marker signals should fly the pattern as described and attempt to drop the kit 4 seconds prior to the target. 19.5.2.5.  CSO Assistance for Sea Rescue Kits.  The CSO can assist the pilot by the use of onboard systems.  The CSO will advise the pilot when the aircraft approaches the final delivery track. 19.5.2.5.1.  The CSO should set up the CNI-MU as follows:  (T3) 19.5.2.5.1.1.  During  the  flight  plan  programming  portion  of  the  preflight,  the CSO should load two dummy waypoints that will later serve as the IP and target.  (The target will be the location of the survivor or position to which the kit will be delivered.).    Note:    This  step  will  save  time  in-flight  by  eliminating  the  need  to AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   239  modify the flight plan sequence. 19.5.2.5.1.2.  As the aircraft flies over the target on the initial pass, the CSO will mark  this  position  and  store  it.    (T3)    The  wind  (e.g.,  180/015)  should  be  noted and recorded at  this time.  The onboard system  will allow the CSO to direct  the pilot perpendicular to the wind on the final run-in to the target. 19.5.2.5.1.3.  Go  to  the  plan  page.    (T3)    Call  up  the  dummy  waypoint  that  was initially designated the target  and re-designate it as the mark point (stored target position).  Verify this waypoint.  (T3) 19.5.2.5.1.4.  Go to the preceding waypoint and re-designate it as the mark point.  (T3) 19.5.2.5.1.5.  Define an IP using a range and bearing from the original mark point and  save  it  as  the  waypoint  prior  to  the  target.    (T3)    Use  a  bearing  that  is  the reciprocal of the desired run-in heading (e.g., 090/270°) and a range of 5 to 10 nm and verify.  (T3)  The pilot must confirm the final run-in heading before the CSO can load the bearing.  (T3)  Note:  Keep in mind that the target will drift.  This is basically  a  visual  maneuver;  the  navigation  systems  are  used  as  a  backup.    The pilot should make every attempt to keep the target in sight. 19.5.2.5.1.6.  The pilot will use the system to help maintain situational awareness and  line  up  on  the  target  for  the  delivery  pass.    During  the  run-in,  the  pilot  will offset upwind or downwind as necessary (see Paragraph 19.10.2.1).  (T3) 19.5.3.  Para-Bundle and Freefall Deployment: 19.5.3.1.  When practical, use a racetrack pattern with the drop heading into the wind for equipment  drops.    However,  circumstances  may  dictate  a  modified  pattern.    Equipment may  be  dropped  from  the  paratroop  doors  or  the  aft  cargo  door  and  ramp.    The  first bundle dropped is, in effect, a spotter bundle.  Therefore, it should be the least critical to the  survivors.    Water  deliveries  must  consider  wind,  drift,  and  sea  state.    (T3)    WARNING:  The delivery of  equipment,  no matter how vital,  must never endanger the lives of the receivers.  (T3) 19.5.3.2.  Equipment deliveries to land drop zones should be planned to impact within 50 yards of the target.   Water deliveries should be planned to  impact  within 5  yards of the target  or  within  a  45  sector  centered  on  the  drift  line  for  100  yards.    In  any  case, deliveries should never be in excess of 5 yards up-drift of the target. 19.5.3.3.  Pilot  Procedures.    Pilots  are  responsible  for  determining  the  mode  of deployment;  drop  location,  and  type  pattern  to  be  flown.    (T3)    They  must  ensure  the loadmaster is aware of the desired point of impact (PI).  (T3)  When the situation permits, the pilot will make an observation pass over the drop zone.  Final freefall altitude will be no lower than 150 feet  AGL.  (T3)   Final para-bundle altitude should be no lower than 300  feet  AGL.    Minimum  altitude  for  all  night  airdrops  is  500  feet  AGL.    (T3)   WARNING:  Keep turns below 300 feet AGL to a minimum.  (T3) 19.5.3.3.1.  Aircraft  altitude,  attitude,  course,  and  airspeed  should  be  established  by 30 seconds to  target  and no later than 10 seconds to  target.   The pilot  will keep the crew apprised of their position in the pattern.  (T3)  As a minimum, on final the pilot   240  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 will state "30 seconds to target", then "10 seconds".  (T3)  Once the loadmaster spots the target, he will state, "Target in sight" and provide the pilot with course corrections if time permits.  (T3) 19.5.3.4.  Loadmaster  Procedures.    Loadmasters  must  understand  the  location  of  the desired  PI.    (T3)    When  looking  for  the  target,  the  loadmaster  will  use  either  paratroop door.  (T3)  If the PI is difficult to spot, ask the pilot to give a countdown to the PI on the run in. 19.5.3.4.1.  The loadmaster will hook up the restraint harness as described in Chapter 6.  (T3)  The jump platform will be extended and the air deflector doors opened.  (T3)  The loadmaster may align the aircraft for the airdrop by sighting down the edge of the jump  platform  to  the  drop  zone  and  steering  the  aircraft  with  standard  calls  of “Steady”, “Right, (number of) degrees”, or “Left, (number of) degrees”.  Note:  If the loadmaster places their head on the jump platform to sight and align the aircraft, they should place their head toward the forward edge for para-bundle airdrops, and move their head aft for freefall airdrops and to compensate for higher altitudes. 19.5.3.4.2.  Bundle  dimensions  for  paratroop  door  drops,  including  the  parachute, must  not  exceed  48  by  30  by  66  inches.    (T3)    Bundles  in  excess  of  100  pounds require  a  second  pusher  and  those  between  350-500  pounds  require  two  additional pushers.    (T3)    For  equipment  to  be  delivered  from  the  paratroop  door,  attach  the static line (if used) to tie-down ring 26-B or 26-F.  (T3)  Secure equipment until it is ready for delivery.  (T3) 19.5.3.4.3.  If equipment cannot be delivered from the paratroop door, the loadmaster may  prepare  and  position  the  equipment  on  the  ramp  for  delivery,  and  use  another thoroughly  briefed  crew  member  to  release  the  equipment.    The  equipment  will  be secured until ready for delivery.  (T3)  For equipment to be delivered from the ramp, attach the static line (if used) to a tie-down ring in row 30.  (T3) 19.5.3.4.4.  The loadmaster will normally spot the target 8 seconds prior to the release point, and give the preparatory command  "Ready"  and the deployment command of "Drop".  After each delivery, the loadmaster will report status of drop (load clear or status) and impact point whenever possible. 19.5.3.5.  Equipment  Delivery  in  Forested  Areas.    Due  to  the  possibility  of  equipment hang  up  in  trees,  consideration  should  be  given  to  attaching  drop  lines  to  equipment intended to  be delivered by parachute.  The drop line needs to  be long enough to  allow the chute to hang up in treetops, and still permit ground forces to recover the equipment.  In addition to the drop lines now in use by units (local design and manufacture), consider the possibility of using equipment already maintained on the aircraft, such as Sea Rescue Kit  buoyant  rope  (210  feet  long).    Drop  lines  will  be  secured  to  the  parachute  riser snaps/connectors and equipment package "D/V rings" with carabiners or equivalent.  (T3)  The  drop  line  will  be  assembled  into  accordion  "S"  folds,  secured  with  retainer  bands, and attached to  the equipment  package.  (T3)   Note:  Final approach altitude should be adjusted to compensate for tree height, but never less than 150 feet above the treetops. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   241  19.5.3.6.  Pattern  for  Night  Aerial  Delivery.    NVGs  may  be  used  for  night  operations.  Aircrews will accomplish the Combat Entry checklist to configure the aircraft for NVG operations.  (T3) 19.5.3.7.  Night  Delivery.    Equipment  to  be  delivered  at  night  will  have  marker  lights attached.    (T3)    For  water  drops,  attach  the  light  by  securing  a  double  5-foot  length  of type III nylon (550/cord) to the marker light, then attach the other end to the equipment.  (T3)    Stabilize  the  light  to  the  equipment  with  type  number  5  cord.    (T3)    Pass  the parachute  static  line  under  the  type  number  5  cord  to  ensure  light  breakaway  when deployed.  (T3)  For land drops, chemlites are recommended.  Attach chemlites securely to prevent detachment. 19.6.  Sea Rescue Kit. 19.6.1.  The Sea Rescue Kit consists of five bundles: 19.6.1.1.  The two end bundles (1 and 5) contain either a 6, 7, or 20 man raft.  Bundles 2 and 4 contain emergency radios and bundle 3 contains medical gear. 19.6.1.2.  The total weight of all five bundles is 232 lbs for a MA-1 kit and 311 lbs for a MA-2 kit. 19.6.1.3.  Each bundle is connected by 210 feet of buoyant rope. 19.6.1.4.  The kit is deployed manually off the cargo ramp. 19.6.2.  Rigging Sequence. 19.6.2.1.  Rigging sequence will be as shown in Figure 19.11.  (T3) 19.6.2.2.  During  in-flight  rigging,  the  cargo  ramp  and  door  will  remain  closed.    (T3)  Attach a tie-down strap across the kit to prevent movement.  (T3) 19.6.2.3.  Unsnap the inflation lanyard protection flap of container #1 (raft), marked 1 of 5  and  leave  open.    (T3)    Remove  enough  lanyard  from  the  retaining  loops  to  allow  the snap fastener (yellow) to be fastened to ramp tie-down fitting 30F.  (T3) 19.6.2.4.  Remove  enough  buoyant  rope  from  container  #1  to  allow  the  rope  fastener (red) to be connected to the D-ring (red) of container #2, marked 2 of 5.  (T3) 19.6.2.5.  Remove  enough  buoyant  rope  from  container  #2  to  allow  the  rope  fastener (green) to be connected to the D-ring (green) of the container #3, marked 3 of 5.  (T3) 19.6.2.6.  Remove  enough  buoyant  rope  from  container  #3  to  allow  the  snap  fastener (blue) to be connected to the D-ring (blue) of container #4, marked 4 of 5.  (T3) 19.6.2.7.  Remove enough buoyant rope from container #4 to allow the rope snap fastener (white) to be connected to the lanyard loop of container #5, marked 5 of 5.  (T3) 19.6.2.8.  Unsnap  the  inflation  lanyard  protector  flap  on  container  #5  and  leave  open.  (T3)    Remove  enough  lanyard  from  the  retaining  loops  to  allow  the  snap  fastener (yellow) to be fastened to the ramp tie-down ring 30B.  (T3)  Note:  In high winds, the kit may  be deployed with  the rafts deflated to  improve drop  accuracy.   If this  procedure is necessary,  the  life  raft  inflation  lanyard  should be  shortened  and  red  streamers  attached with  the  words  "PULL  TO  INFLATE"  on  the  streamers  to  facilitate  inflation  by  the   242  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 survivors.  Detailed kit assembly, operation, and service instructions are contained in TO 14S-1-102-21,  Organizational  Maintenance  Instruction  with  Parts  Breakdown,  Multi-Place  Life  Raft  &  Preservers,  LPU-6/P,  LPU-10/P,  LPU-3/P,  MB-1,  A-A-50652  Life Preservers, MA1,MA-2 Sea Rescue Kits, and LRU-1/P, P-2B, 20-Man VPLR, and 25 Man Life Raft Assembly. 19.6.3.  Rigging of Lights on Sea Rescue Kits for Night Airdrops: 19.6.3.1.  Lights  are  attached  to  containers  1,  3,  and  5  (Refer  to  Figure  19.12  for procedures).  The  loadmaster  will  inspect  the  lights  for  proper  function  prior  to installation.  (T3) 19.6.4.  Airdropping a Sea Rescue Kit in Support of SAR: 19.6.4.1.  Aircrews will use the Search Checklist.  (T3) 19.6.4.2.  The loadmaster will deploy the kit manually when the pilot states "Drop".  (T3)  Note:  When delivering the Sea Rescue Kit manually, the loadmaster will deliver all kits starting with the number 1 container.  (T3)  The desired interval is 0.7 seconds between the  containers,  and  all  five  containers  must  be  delivered  within  3.3  seconds  to  prevent line breakage and/or damage to the kit. 19.6.4.3.  Any delay by the loadmaster after the pilot states "Drop" might cause the kit to land long. 19.6.4.4.  The  loadmaster  will  use  a  restraint  harness  with  the  lifeline  attached  to  a  tie-down  ring  no  further  aft  than  FS  737,  or  anchor  cable  with  an  anchor  cable  stop positioned  at  FS  737.    (T3)    The  restraint  harness  lifeline  will  be  adjusted  to  allow movement  to  FS  835.    Note:    The  loadmaster  will  ensure  all  checklist  items  are completed,  maintain  control  of  bundles,  monitor,  and  re-rig  any  loose  straps/static  lines or equipment that may come undone due to wind blast.

General. launching pyrotechnics.  Refer to TO 11A10-24-7, TO 11A10-26-7, TO 11A10-27-7, and TO 11A10-28-7.   This  section  provides information in  preparation  for 19.7.2.  Hazards.    In  general,  pyrotechnics  contain  materials  of  a  hazardous  nature.    Even though each of the ingredients in a pyrotechnic composition may be relatively stable within   244  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 itself, it may react with one or more of the other materials to cause deterioration and create an even greater hazard.  Pyrotechnics are more dangerous than many other types of ammunition because  they  are  more  easily  activated.    These  items  should  not  be  handled  roughly  or exposed to moisture.  When subjected to fire, most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat. 19.7.2.1.  Toxic Hazards.  Many chemicals used in pyrotechnic devices are poisonous if taken  internally.    This  also  applies  to  the  residues  of  burned  pyrotechnics.    From  an inhalation standpoint, the products of pyrotechnic devices and smoke generators present a serious problem.  Although most of the smoke and fumes given off by pyrotechnics are considered non-toxic, heavy concentrations in closely confined spaces are dangerous and may be lethal, for they reduce the amount of available oxygen in the air. 19.7.3.  Handling.  Besides the hazardous basic compositions, pyrotechnics contain sensitive elements such as fuses, friction compositions, and primers.  Pyrotechnics should be handled with  care  and  protected  against  moisture,  shock,  friction,  or  heat.    Care  should  be  taken  to avoid  premature  ignition  or  damage  that  may  cause  failure  when  fired.    Boxes  containing pyrotechnics  should  not  be  dropped  or  thrown.    Protective  or  safety  devices  should  not  be removed until just before use.  Care should be taken to avoid damage to fiber cases and rip cords  located  outside  the  casing  of  flares.    Pyrotechnics  should  be  handled  so  as  to  avoid denting or deforming the barrel or case.  Do not use pyrotechnics that are dented, deformed, cracked, broken, or have signs of advanced rust, looped closing, or have shipping covers with an  illegible  lot  number,  manufacture  date,  or  other  required  identifying  information.  Pyrotechnics  will  be  handled  only  under  the  supervision  of  mission  qualified  aircrew  or  an AFE instructor .  (T3)  Most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat; therefore, personnel should be  adequately  prepared  to  handle  an  emergency  situation  (e.g.,  heat  resistant  gloves  and broom). 19.7.4.  Storage.  Units that have a requirement for storing pyrotechnics will obtain a license from the host base.  (T3) 19.7.5.  Issue  Procedures.    Pyrotechnics  that  have  been  issued  for  training  purposes  will  be marked  in  bold  capital  letters  with  the  word  TRAINING.    (T3)    These  pyrotechnics  will always be stored separately from operational stock within storage areas.  (T3) 19.7.6.  Safety.    All  of  the  pyrotechnics  described  contain  combustible  chemicals  which, when  ignited,  generate  a  flame  or  smoke  (or  combination  of  both)  for  a  broad  variety  of purposes.    These  purposes  include  visual  signaling,  area  or  target  illumination,  and  point marking.  Most are intended to burn with intense heat. 19.7.6.1.  Initiation  Mechanism.    Pyrotechnic  devices  normally  are  equipped  with  some type of safety pin, lock, or tape designed to prevent accidental activation of the initiation mechanism.    Any  pyrotechnic  which  shows  sign  of  damage  to  safety  features  is considered  unserviceable  and  must  be  carefully  segregated  for  prompt  disposition  by Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD).  (T3) 19.7.6.2.  Accidental Initiation.  If a pyrotechnic device should be accidentally ignited, in all  cases  its  functioning  will  result  in  a  fire  hazard.    The  gases  generated  by  this combustion could present a serious toxic hazard.  Signaling devices containing propellant charges create an extremely dangerous missile hazard if accidentally ignited. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   245  19.7.6.3.  Fighting  Pyrotechnic  Fires.   Pyrotechnic  compositions  characteristically contain  their  own  oxidants,  and  therefore  do  not  depend  upon  atmospheric  oxygen  for combustion.  For this reason, excluding air from a pyrotechnic fire usually is ineffective.  Many  pyrotechnic  mixtures,  particularly  illuminating  flare  compositions,  burn  with intense heat up to 4,500° F.  Normally, available extinguishers are of little or no value in fires of this kind, and in addition, may produce toxic or poisonous gases. 19.7.6.4.  Safe Altitudes and Distances.  Flares not entirely burned out and cooled when they land may ignite combustible material.  Safe altitudes and distances depend upon the burning  time,  rate  of  descent,  and  drift  of  the  flare.    Such  factors  will  be  considered  in determining minimum altitudes and distances of release.  Signal flares are also a potential fire hazard when the parachute fails to support the signal properly.    CAUTION:  Flares will not be launched over areas subject to fire except in an extreme emergency.  (T3)  If such  an  emergency  exists,  flares  should  be  dropped  from  sufficient  altitude  to  allow complete burnout before hitting the surface. 19.7.6.5.  Reporting  Instructions.    Prepare  instructions  for  mishaps,  accidents,  and incidents  in  accordance  with  AFI  91-204,  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports.    Prepare unsatisfactory  reports  in  accordance  with  TO  00-35D-54,  USAF  Deficiency  Reporting and Investigating System. 19.7.7.  Pyrotechnics Launching: 19.7.7.1.  Personnel  launching  pyrotechnics  through  open  doors  or  hatches  will  wear  a restraint harness or parachute, and will have armored or heat resistant gloves and a broom or  wood  stick  readily  available  in  case  of  fire.    (T3)    Wearing  nomex  gloves  when deploying  pyrotechnics  is  recommended.    When  manually  launching  parachute  flares from  the  aircraft,  only  the  cargo  ramp  will  be  opened  unless  the  mission  dictates otherwise.  (T3)  (This is to assist in eliminating pyrotechnics missile hazard). 19.7.7.2.  The  aircraft  will  be  prepared  for  flare  jettison  prior  to  handling  any pyrotechnic.    (T3)    Only  the  cargo  ramp  will  be  opened  unless  mission  requirements dictate otherwise.   All  parachute flares hand-launched from  the ramp  will use a 10-foot lanyard (Refer to Figure  19.13).  (T3)  The flare will be hand-launched upon command of the PIC or designated crew member.  (T3)    CAUTION:  Personnel launching flares will  ensure  the  lanyard  system  is  clear  of  extremities  and  equipment  before  launching.  (T3)  Excess lanyard should be accordion folded and held against the body of the flare or taped with paper tape. 19.7.8.  Pyrotechnics Description and Operation: 19.7.8.1.  LUU-2/B, 2A/B; Flare, Aircraft Parachute: 19.7.8.1.1.  Description.  The LUU-2/B, 2A/B is an air-launched parachute flare.  It is 36  inches  long,  4.875  inches  in  diameter  and  rated  as  providing  2-million candlepower illumination for approximately 300 seconds (5 minutes).  Some uses are illumination of areas for crash landing, ditching, landing, target, dropping of supplies, hovering of rescue aircraft, etc. 19.7.8.1.2.  Operation.  Remove the flare from shipping container and set desired feet of  fall  in  flare  timer  end  cap.    A  setting  of  500  feet  represents  a  time  delay  of  6.3   246  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 seconds.    A  launch  altitude  of  3,000  feet  AGL  is  recommended  and  will  provide  a light at 2,500 feet AGL.  The flare descends approximately 2,500 feet during burning and will burn out and dump at ground level.  The snap hook in the lanyard package of the  flare  shipping  container  may  be  used  for  the  flare  attaching  end.    The  10-foot lanyard secured to a tie-down ring near the aft end of the ramp will be attached to the lanyard or to the timer dial knob.  Upon launch signal, toss the flare overboard from the rear of the ramp, or floor jettison port with ignition end out first (ignition end is opposite from the timer end cap).   A force of 30 to 35 pounds is required to extract the timer dial knob and drogue cover strip.  The knob and cover strip will remain with the static line.  Retrieve the static line and remove the timer dial knob from the snap hook.  Stow the timer dial knob until mission is over; then dispose of all residue. 19.7.8.2.  LUU-4B; Flare, Aircraft Parachute: 19.7.8.2.1.  Description.  The LUU-4/B is an air launched parachute flare.  It is 25.5 inches long, 4.875 inches in diameter, and rated as providing 1.6-million candlepower illumination  for  approximately  180  seconds  (3  minutes).    Uses  are  the  same  as  the LUU-2/B, 2A/B. 19.7.8.2.2.  Operation.  The flare altitude should be planned so as that burnout occurs approximately  300  feet  AGL  over  water  and  higher  over  land.    Recommend maximum  deployment  airspeed  of  200  KIAS/KCAS  due  to  possible  failure  of  the parachute system.  Manual launch procedures are the same as LUU-2/B procedures. 19.7.8.3.  LUU-2/B, LUU-2A/B, LUU-4/B Emergency Procedures: 19.7.8.3.1.  Premature  timer  release/ignition  in  aircraft  or  storage  container:    Nylon cord  -  Cut;  Container  -  Taped;  Pilot  -  Notified.              WARNING:    In  the  event  the timer  end  cap  is  separated  from  the  flare,  do  not  pull  on  the  nylon  cord  or  the parachute.    An  approximate  50-pound  pull  on  one  of  the  suspension  cables  of  the parachute will cause the flare to ignite.  Return the flare to the shipping container and turn flare over to EOD at mission completion.  (T3) 19.7.8.3.2.  Pre-Ignition  of  Flare:    Jettison  flare  or  container  immediately;  Pilot-notified.  (T3)  WARNING:  In the event of flare ignition, an attempt will be made to jettison the flare.  (T3)  In event of candle ignition, intense light, heat, and lethal gas will be experienced.  Adequate respiratory, eye, and hand protection will be sought as soon as emergency permits.  Flare suppression will be attempted as a last resort.  (T3) 19.7.8.3.3.  Flare breakaway fails to release:  Static line - Cut; Pilot - Notified.  (T3)    WARNING:    Packaged  aircraft  parachute  flares  dropped  in  excess  of  3  feet  or unpackaged flares dropped in excess of 1 foot shall be considered unserviceable. 19.7.8.4.  MK-6 MOD 3; Signal, Smoke, and Illumination, Aircraft: 19.7.8.4.1.  Description.  This signal marker provides long burning (approximately 40 minutes)  surface  smoke  and  illumination  for  day  or  night  use.    It  is  used  to  mark sightings at sea, make sea evaluations, marking a sea lane for night water landing, and to  simulate  targets  for  the  firing  of  weapons.    It  may  be  used  to  provide  smoke  on land surfaces if a fire hazard does not exist. AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   247  19.7.8.4.2.  Operation.    Prior  to  launching  the  signal  marker,  remove  the  adhesive tape covering the pull ring.  (T3)     WARNING:  The smoke signal has a 90 second ignition delay and must be launched immediately after the igniter has been actuated.  (T3)            WARNING:    Packaged  signal  markers  dropped  in  excess  of  10  feet  or unpackaged signals dropped in excess of 5 feet shall be considered unserviceable, and reported to OO-ALC/MMWR, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5609.  (T3)      WARNING:  Do not prepare more than 2 marks at a time, and do not remove more than 4 marks at a time  from  the  storage  container  in-flight.    (T3)            Note:    Do  not  remove  the  four square  patches  of  adhesive  tape  covering  the  metal  caps  in  the  holes  from  which flame  and  smoke  issue  after  ignition  of  the  candle.    (T3)    At  the  time  the  signal  is launched, the pull-type igniter is actuated by hand. 19.7.8.5.  MK-25 MOD 3; Marker, Location Marine: 19.7.8.5.1.  Description.    This  marker  was  designed  for  day  or  night  use  for  all surface reference point  marking purposes that call for smoke and flame  in  the 13 to 18 minute range. 19.7.8.5.2.  Operation.    To  activate  the  marker,  the  base  plate  must  be  rotated  from the safe to the armed position to allow the battery cavity ports to be opened.  Open the ports  by  pressing  the  two  brass-colored  port  plugs  into  the  battery  cavity  using  the thumb and forefinger.  A one-pound force is required for plug removal.  This device is considered to be a sealed unit until either or both base plugs have been pushed in.     WARNING:  The MK-25 must not be returned to storage with the base plugs pushed in.  (T3)  The nose end of this marker must be kept out of line with the body or with other personnel at all times.  (T3)  If marker is initiated, the nose plug is expelled with considerable force creating a missile hazard. 19.7.8.5.3.  Special Precautions.  This marker may be converted for use in fresh water by  adding  1/2  or  3/4  ounces  of  table  salt  or  two  salt  tablets  through  the  base  plugs.      WARNING:  Converted markers must be used after adding salt.  (T3)  They must not be returned to storage.  (T3)  If not used, they must be jettisoned in flight, over water.  (T3)       CAUTION:  Be sure salt is not exposed to moisture before and during the conversion  process,  as  moist  salt  may  cause  marker  to  ignite.    (T3)          CAUTION:  Packaged flares dropped in excess of 6 feet or unpackaged flares dropped in excess of 3  feet  shall  be  considered  unserviceable.    (T3)    Report  to  OO-ALC/MMWR,  Hill AFB, UT 840565609.  (T3)     Note:  Converted markers will not perform as reliably in fresh water as unconverted markers in seawater.   248  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 Figure 19.5.  Rescue Lanyard.   TOD D.

Self-propelled  vehicles  must  have  drivers  in  place  with brakes  set  prior  to  removing  restraints.    (T3)    Exception:    All  restraints  will  remain  on helicopters except for the tail boom until the aircraft has come to a complete stop.  (T3) A2.2.9.  Do  not  position  the  cargo  ramp  below  horizontal  until  the  aircraft  comes  to  a complete  stop  at  the  offload  point.    (T3)    For  areas  where  ground  threats  or  mission requirements  dictate  minimum  time  on  the  ground,  the  loadmaster  and  the  PIC  will  brief  a countdown for movement of the ramp below horizontal.  (T3)  Caution must be exercised to ensure the ramp does not contact the ground before the aircraft stops.  (T3) A2.2.10.  Do  not  deploy  canary  slides/ground  loading  ramps  until  the  ramp  is  positioned below horizontal and the aircraft has stopped. A2.2.11.  Clearance to offload:  A loadmaster will be positioned on the vehicle driver’s side of the cargo ramp and raise both arms to signal clearance to offload.  (T3)  The loadmaster will drop both arms to signal vehicle drivers to halt offload operations.  (T3) A2.2.12.  Offload vehicles and personnel as trained during statics.  (T3) A2.2.13.  Clear  a  stalled  vehicle  immediately  to  the  aircraft  right  (engines  3  and  4)  or  as static  trained  to  allow  the  offload  to  continue.    (T3)    Note:    If  a  time  delay  occurs  before onloading/departure, turn off all (NVIS)/NVG lighting and raise the ramp approximately 12 inches to allow the aircraft to be taxied in the event of an emergency.  (T3) A2.3.  Onload Operations. A2.3.1.  A loadmaster will remain on headset at all times (normally the left side loadmaster).  (T3) A2.3.2.

(T3)  Once the ramp and door are closed and locked, the cargo compartment (NVIS)/NVG lights may be turned to the maximum setting (if required).  After all cargo and personnel restraint is checked, the loadmaster will advise the crew “SECURE”.  (T3) A2.3.9.  Rapid  Infiltration/Exfiltration.    Rapids  are  a  tactical  method  of  onloading  or offloading  dedicated  unconventional  and  SOF  Forces.    Spring-loaded,  latch-activated, folding  ramps  (canary  slides),  or  ground  loading  ramps  are  used  to  offload  and  onload vehicles,  personnel,  and  H-6  series  helicopters  in  minimal  time.    Selection  of  the onload/offload  point  and  aircraft  orientation  impacts  total  ground  times.    Extensive  pre-mission planning/static load training may be required for large or complex loads.  Exception:  Group  commander/COMAFSOF  (for  contingency  operations)  may  authorize  Rapid Infil/Exfil  procedures  and  floor  loading  with  non-  SOF  personnel  to  meet  unit  training requirements.  (T-3) A2.3.10.  The loadmaster will notify the onboard user of the one-minute warning.  (T3) A2.3.11.  When the CSO calls 100 ft, the loadmaster will notify the onboard user, "Prepare To Land".  (T3) A2.3.12.  After Touchdown. A2.3.13.  During  the  initial  Infil/Exfil  brief,  the  pilot  may  prebrief  the  opening  of  the  ramp and door upon  reversing of the  engines.  When there is  a delay in the offload/onload or an extended  ground  time  is  anticipated,  raise  the  ramp  approximately  12  inches  above  the ground so the aircraft can taxi in the event of an emergency.  (T3)  Refer to Rapid Infiltration Procedures.  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   283  Attachment 3 COMBAT OFFLOAD PROCEDURES A3.1.  The method of combat offload will be determined by the aircrew based on the conditions at the offload site.  (T3) A3.2.  Cargo pallets, airdrop platforms, and CDS containers can be offloaded without damage to the  aircraft  with  the  cargo  ramp  in  the  horizontal  position.    Use  the  following  methods  for combat offload operations.  (T3) A3.2.1.  Method  A.    Use  this  method  to  offload  single,  multiple,  ramp  or  married  pallets, airdrop platforms, and CDS containers.  (T3)  Pallets, platforms, or CDS may be offloaded in a train like fashion or one-by-one as the situation dictates.  Note:  When quickly offloading fragile  items  (such  as  computers),  loadmasters  may  lower  the  ramp  to  a  position approximately 18 inches above the ground to lessen the chances of damage.  As a technique, loadmasters  can  restrain  the  load  with  a  drift  strap  while  the  pilot  slowly  taxis  from underneath the load.     WARNING:  Many explosive items have specific "drop" criteria that, if  exceeded,  render  the  item  useless  or  dangerous  to  the  user.    With  the exception  of  small arms  ammunition  (hazard  class  and  division  1.4),  explosives  and  munitions  shall  not  be combat  offloaded  without  approval  of  MAJCOM/A3.    (T2)    Exception:    Explosives  and munitions rigged for airdrop may be combat offloaded without MAJCOM/A3 approval.  (T3)  CAUTION:    A  taxiway  or  ramp  at  least  500  feet  long  is  required;  however,  1,000  feet  is desired  to  provide  a  margin  of  safety.    (T3)    When  pallets,  platforms,  or  containers  are offloaded one at a time, use a longer taxiway based on the number to be offloaded.  (T-2). A3.2.1.1.  Single or double/triple married pallets may be offloaded, without ballast, using this method provided their weight does not exceed 12,000 pounds, and the height of the pallets fall within cargo height jettison limit in section III of the flight manual or Chapter 5 of the cargo loading manual. A3.2.1.2.  Airdrop  rigged  platforms  up  to  24  feet  in  length  may  be  offloaded,  without ballast, using this method provided their weight  does not exceed 12,000 pounds.   Note:  Single  or  married  pallets  and  airdrop  rigged  platforms  over  12,000  pounds  may  be offloaded  using  this  method,  provided  ballast  or  cargo  equal  to  the  difference  between 12,000 pounds and the weight of the pallets or platforms (to be offloaded) remains in C through  F  compartments  during  offload.    Example:    A  17,000  pound  married  pallet  or airdrop  platform  requires  5,000  pounds  of  ballast  or  cargo  to  remain  in  C  through  F compartments during the offload.  (T3) A3.2.1.3.  CDS  bundles  may  be  combat  offloaded  using  this  method.    The  static  line retriever  or  manual  gate  cut  can  be  used  as  required.    With  the  Centerline  Vertical Restraint  (CVR),  offload  must  be  accomplished  one  side  at  a  time  if  the  total  bundle weight  exceeds  12,000  pounds.    Non-CVR  single  stick  may  be  offloaded  if  the  total weight is less than 12,000 pounds.  Without the CVR, if the total weight of the bundles exceeds  12,000  pounds,  bundles  should  be  restrained  in  groups  of  four  or  less  and offloaded one group at a time.  For the unplanned combat offload of non-CVR bundles, restrain the bundles as described above.  (T3)  Perform an initial offload via the static line retriever, and on sequential offload remove aft restraint before clearing the pilot to taxi.  (T3)    Consider  the  slope  of  the  offload  site,  which  may  cause  bundles  to  roll  aft  upon   284  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015 removal  of  restraint.        CAUTION:    When  using  method  "A"  on  excessively  rough, sharply undulating, or battle- damaged surfaces, damage to the aircraft ramp may occur.  Reducing forward taxi speed on these surfaces will reduce aircraft oscillation.  The PIC must  determine  if  the  offload  area  will  permit  the  offload  operation  to  be  conducted without damage to the aircraft or equipment.  (T3) A3.2.2.  Method B.  Use this method to offload married pallets that do not fit the category for method A or for which no ballast is available for married pallets weighing between 12,000 to 15,000 pounds.  (T3)  Use four serviceable steel 55-gallon drums under each pallet to be offloaded.  (T3)  The correct number of steel drums needed to complete this type of offload must be available at the offload site or must accompany the load when conditions at the offload site are unknown.  (T3)    WARNING:  The maximum weight for pallets to be offloaded across the ramp at any one time when using method B is 15,000 lbs.  (T3)     WARNING:  Do not use method B for airdrop-rigged platforms to prevent binding the platform under the vertical restraint rails.  (T3) A3.2.3.  Aircrew Procedures: A3.2.3.1.  Prior to commencing combat offload operations, the pilot will brief each crew member  on  the  method  to  be  used.    Specific  procedures  are  in  the  expanded  checklist.  (T3) A3.2.3.2.  All  crew  members  participating  in  the  offload  will  refer  to  the  checklist.  Report any problem to the pilot immediately.  (T3) A3.2.3.3.  If  other  individuals  must  be  aboard  to  assist  the  crew  in  an  unusual circumstance, give them a thorough safety and procedures briefing for the entire offload sequence.  (T3) A3.2.3.4.  The loadmaster will maintain constant interphone contact with the PIC and is the  only  crew  member  authorized  to  operate  the  dual  rail  locks  during  combat  offload operations.  (T3)     WARNING:  During the entire offload operation, no one is permitted behind or beside the load unless the loadmaster checks that all rail locks are locked and engaged  in  the  pallet  detents  or  secures'  each  pallet  to  aircraft  tie-down  rings  to  ensure positive aft restraint.  (T3)  AFI11-2EC-130JV3  8 APRIL 2015   285  Attachment 4 ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS OPERATOR DUTIES A4.1.  General.
