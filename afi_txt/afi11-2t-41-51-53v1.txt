(T-2). 1.6.  Pilot Utilization: 1.6.1.  Commanders will ensure assigned pilots fill only authorized positions as listed in unit manpower documents (UMD) and that pilot status is properly designated.  (T-2).  The overall objective is for pilots to perform only operations-related duties.  Supervisors may assign pilots to  valid,  short-term  tasks  (escort  officer,  flying  evaluation  board  member,  mishap  board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of pilot tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience. 1.6.2.  Duties  required  by  various  publications  that  may  be  assigned  to  aircrew  position indicator  (API)-1  pilots  are  quality  assurance  evaluator,  programmer,  flying  safety  officer, SOF,  mobility  contingency  plans  officer,  training  (except  ARMS  duties),  flight  equipment officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations.  API-1s will not be attached to wing staffs or hold wing staff positions unless total wing pilot API-1 and API-6 manning is 100 percent or better.  (T-2).  Commanders will ensure wing staff pilots (API-6s) perform duties justified in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and authorized in the UMD.  (T-2). 1.7.  Functional Check Flight (FCF) Program.

The squadron commander certifies aircrew training and certification items appropriate for the unit’s missions on a monthly Letter of Xs according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1.  See Attachment 2 of this instruction for a sample Letter of Xs.  (T-2).  Note: The squadron DO may accomplish the monthly review and certify the Letter of Xs if the squadron commander is not available. 1.13.  Fuel Conservation.  It is the responsibility of all aircrew to conserve fuel to the maximum extent possible. Individual crewmembers and supervisors at all levels will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization is considered throughout all phases of  mission  planning  and  execution.  Once  the  objectives  of  training  are  complete,  sorties  are terminated at the earliest opportunity. Adherence to average sortie duration is not the driving factor of whether to land the aircraft or continue the mission. 12 AFI11-2T-41-51-53V1  9 JUNE 2017 Chapter 2 INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT) 2.1.  General: 2.1.1.  This chapter outlines the IQT program.  On completion of the program, pilots will be qualified in accordance with (IAW) AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-41-51-53, Volume 2, T-41, T-51, and T-53 Evaluation Criteria, as first pilots (FP).  Note: Only one combined evaluation is required when pilots complete MQT in conjunction with IQT. 2.1.2.  Except  in  unusual  circumstances,  commanders  will  ensure  aircrew  members undergoing qualification (initial and mission) training receive ground and flight instruction with  a  minimum  of  interruption,  and  complete  training  within  the  time  specified  by  the syllabus.  (T-2).  Individuals will be dedicated to training and should not be utilized for in-unit jobs or other duties until the completion of training.  When individuals fail to complete training within the specified time limit, units will notify the group commander of the individual’s name and grade, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.  (T-2). 2.1.3.  Completion of IQT qualifies the pilot to act as pilot in command (PIC) of the aircraft under day visual flight rules (VFR). 2.2.  Prerequisites.  Before  entering  qualification  training,  each  aircrew  member  must  comply with  the  appropriate  formal  course  training  prerequisites  prescribed  in  education  and  training course  announcements  (ETCA)  available  at  https:\\etca.randolph.af.mil.    In  addition,  all personnel maintaining flying status will meet the physical examination and training requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, before flying.  (T-2). 2.2.1.  USAFA cadets entering training for T-41  or T-51 qualification must hold at least a Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA) private  pilot  certificate  with  an  airplane single- engine land rating and at least an FAA third-class medical certificate. 2.2.2.  Civilian pilots must meet the requirements of AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and hold  at  least  an  FAA  third-class  medical  certificate  and  a  flight  instructor  certificate  with airplane and single-engine ratings.  (Exception: Former military pilots need not hold a flight instructor certificate if they maintain an instructor pilot qualification IAW AFI 11-2T-41-51-53, Volume 2.) 2.3.  Ground  Training.  Commanders  will  ensure  ground  training  follows  the  formal  course syllabus flow.  (T-2).  For in-unit qualification training, commanders will obtain and use current formal school courseware, if available.  (T-2). 2.4.  Flying Training. 2.4.1.  Pilots in IQT will fly under direct IP supervision until they complete the qualification evaluation.  (T-2). 2.4.2.  At a minimum, IQT requires formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks. 2.4.3.  Additional  training  due  to  student  non-progression  is  only  available  within  the constraints of the formal course syllabus. AFI11-2T-41-51-53V1  9 JUNE 2017 13 2.4.4.  Pilots  may  satisfy  MQT  and  specialized  training  requirements  during  IQT  if  the appropriate IP is available and the formal course training allows. 2.5.  Basic Aircraft Requalification Training  .  Units will follow the requalification guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and paragraph 4.5.2.1. 2.6.  Conversion and Difference Qualifications.  Conversion qualification follows the guidance in this chapter and the formal course qualification syllabus.  Difference training is authorized for qualification when the pilot is qualified in any single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft and will be qualified in another.  The formal course syllabus identifies the minimum difference training.  No other difference training is authorized. 2.7.  Multiple Qualifications.  Qualification in more than one mission  design series (MDS) is authorized IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1.  (Note: Multiple qualifications are not authorized for general  officers.)    Multiple  qualifications  require  completion  of  IQT  or  difference  training  as specified in this chapter.  Note: Difference qualification is authorized in paragraph 2.6. 2.8.  Senior Officer Qualification.  Comply with the guidance provided in AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. 2.9.  Flight  Surgeon  (FS)  Qualification.  FS  ground  and  flying  training  is  IAW  AFI  11-202, Volume 1. 2.9.1.  For flying training, upon completion of ground training, an FS is qualified to occupy any seat when an IP or flight trainer (FT) is at the controls.  An FS will not operate the controls unless a rated IP is at the controls and the FS will not fly during critical phases of flight.    (T-2). 14 AFI11-2T-41-51-53V1  9 JUNE 2017 Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT) 3.1.  General.  MQT upgrades qualified aircrew to MR status as an IP.  For rated pilots and civilian pilots, MQT is normally conducted in conjunction with IQT (Chapter 2).  At the completion of MQT, the squadron commander certifies the pilot as an MR IP. 3.2.  Prerequisites. 3.2.1.  Completion of IQT, unless conducted in conjunction with MQT. 3.2.2.  Before entering MQT, each aircrew member must comply with the appropriate formal course training syllabus and AFI 11-202, Volume 1, prerequisites. (T-1). 3.3.  Ground Training.  Units will maintain lesson plans for MQT ground training.  (T-2).  When MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, minimum ground training will consist of the IP ground training required by the formal course training syllabus. 3.4.  Flying Training.  When aircrew MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, complete the instructional sorties required by the formal course instructor syllabus.  Accomplish at least three sorties in the right seat under the supervision of an upgrade IP. 3.5.  Training Completion.  Aircrew must complete MQT within the training time prescribed in the formal course syllabus.  (T-2).  Aircrew will concentrate on their training and should not be assigned to other duties while they are in training status.  The FTG commander is waiver authority for training time extensions.  Units will document this waiver in the individual’s training record.  (T-2).  Units may consider MQT complete after successful completion of a mission evaluation. 3.6.  Documentation.  Document MQT in the individual’s training record.  (T-2). 3.7.  Sorties.  When MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, units will log MQT sorties as missions support sorties.  (T-2).  MQT sorties and events may be used to meet the sortie and event requirements for the upgrade pilot during the training cycle in which they are flown. 3.8.  Loss  of  Instructor  (IP)  Qualification.  Failure  of  a  mission  evaluation,  a  commander-directed downgrade, or failure to perform instructor duties according to paragraph 3.10 results in the  loss  of  instructor  qualification.  To  regain  qualification,  aircrew  must,  at  a  minimum, successfully complete a mission evaluation according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-41-51-53, Volume 2. 3.9.  Loss of MR/BAQ Status: 3.9.1.  Pilots will be placed in non-mission ready (NMR)/non basic aircraft qualification (N-BAQ) status if they: 3.9.1.1.  Fail any flight evaluation.  To regain MR/BAQ status, pilots must successfully reaccomplish the failed flight evaluation according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-41-51-53, Volume 2.  (T-2) 3.9.1.2.  Fail  a  ground  requisite  qualification  or  boldface  examination.    (T-2)    (Note: Failure of a monthly boldface exam does not require decertification if the exam is retaken and passed before the next flight.)  To regain MR/BAQ status, pilots must successfully reaccomplish the failed exam. (T-2) AFI11-2T-41-51-53V1  9 JUNE 2017 15 3.9.1.3.  Fail to complete minimum requirements IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1.  To regain MR/BAQ status, pilots must successfully complete the required event. 3.9.2.  IPs may retain MR status for loss of currency that does not affect aircraft qualification or failure to accomplish annual and semiannual flying requirements, however, will not instruct or fly the deficient events according to the restrictions and guidance of AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and this instruction.  (T-2) 3.9.3.  While NMR, pilots will not accomplish instructor duties (ground or flight).  (T-2) 3.9.4.  While N-BAQ, pilots will not act as pilot-in-command of T-41, T-51, or T-53 aircraft.  (T-1) 3.10.  Instructor  Requalification.  The  following  provides  criteria  for  requalifying  instructors who have not performed T-41, T-51 and T-53 instructor flying duties for: 3.10.1.  A  Period  Up  to  225  Days.  The  individual  is  placed  in  supervised  status  and  at  a minimum: 3.10.1.1.  Pilots must fly ID sorties with current and qualified experienced IPs until all expired currencies are updated.  (T-2).  Refer to paragraph 4.3.5 and Table 4.2. 3.10.2.  A Period of 226 Days to 2 Years.  The individual may complete a locally generated upgrade at the discretion of the FTG commander.  Commanders will develop an individual upgrade program taking into account the individual’s previous experience and currency.  (T-2).  Highly experienced instructors will conduct the flying training.  A mission evaluation is completed for requalification. (T-2).  The unit will send an information copy of the approved training program to AETC/A3V.  (T-2). 3.10.2.1.  Items  successfully  accomplished  during  the  course  of  requalification  training may be used to establish initial dates for individual currency requirements in Table 4.3.  This includes items accomplished during requalification evaluations.  Commanders will ensure items that are not accomplished are flown and updated with a current and qualified instructor of like qualified crew position prior to designating the individual as MR.  (T-2). 3.10.3.  A  Period  of  2  to  5  Years.  The  individual  will  complete  an  appropriate  instructor requalification program. (T-2). 3.10.4.  More Than 5 Years.  The individual will complete the appropriate PIT or MAJCOM A3-approved syllabus. (T-2). 16 AFI11-2T-41-51-53V1  9 JUNE 2017 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT) 4.1.  General.  This chapter outlines the minimum training considered necessary to maintain a viable T-41, T-51 and T-53 aircrew corps to meet mission demands.  Judicious scheduling of CT is necessary to develop aircrew and ensure training standardization.  Sufficient flying hours are included in the annual FHP to allow every qualified aircrew member to accomplish all events and currencies listed in this chapter.  Squadron commanders will ensure the squadron FHP is managed to afford all aircrews ample opportunity to complete required CT. (T-2). 4.1.1.  Units may direct additional training in a supplement to this AFI. 4.1.2.  Units will track all ground and flying training requirements in ARMS.  (Refer to ETCA for ancillary training.)  (T-2). 4.2.  Training Cycle.  Semi-annual CT training cycles are: 1 January to 30 June and 1 July to 31 December.  Semiannual requirements are reviewed at the end of each cycle. 4.3.  CT Administration. 4.3.1.  CT Meetings.  Squadron commanders will direct and supervise quarterly CT meetings for aircrew members.  (T-2).  The purpose of these meetings is to discuss standardization, safety, mission-related topics, and to increase general knowledge among all pilots.  A CRM topic or scenario will be discussed in each CT meeting referring to CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290.  (T-2). 4.3.2.  IP  Meetings.  Commanders  will  direct  and  supervise  quarterly  IP  meetings.    (T-2).  Commanders  will  use  these  meetings  to  discuss  standardization,  instructional  techniques, grading practices, and recent trends.  They may be combined with CT meetings if all topics are adequately covered. 4.3.3.  Attendance.  Commanders will make attendance at CT and IP meetings mandatory.  (T-2).  Squadron commanders determine the conditions that will excuse attendance.  (T-2).  The unit will determine a method to track attendance as part of the go/no-go process for flight.  (T-2).  Individuals not available for CT or IP meetings will read the meeting minutes or be briefed by an operations supervisor before their next flight.  (T-2). 4.3.4.  Requirements.  Minimum  requirements  are  identified  in  this  chapter,  but  units  will direct  additional  training  in  a  supplement  to  this  instruction  as  necessary  for  individual requirements.  (T-2). 4.3.4.1.  ID  Sorties.    ID  sorties  provide  an  opportunity  for  instructors  to  enhance  their mission effectiveness and improve student performance.  While these sorties provide for flying  skills  improvement,  update  currency,  and  allow  for  accomplishment  of  events required by this chapter, the purposes of ID sorties are to develop the unit’s instructors and standardize training.  An ID sortie allows experienced instructors to pass on successful techniques and methods to less experienced instructors beyond formal training.  The buddy IP (BIP) program’s sponsor sorties and ID sorties allow inexperienced IPs to learn and refine techniques while flying with more experienced IPs. AFI11-2T-41-51-53V1  9 JUNE 2017 17 4.3.5.  Prorating End-of-Cycle Requirements.  At the end of the training cycle, the squadron commander may prorate training requirements according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, for aircrew members who were not available for flying duties. 4.3.5.1.  Commanders  will  prorate  only  to  adjust  for  genuine  circumstances  of  training nonavailability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies.  (T-2). 4.3.5.2.  Base prorating  on consecutive days of  nonflying in the training cycle (applies separately for each period of nonflying).  Commanders will use the prorating allowance in Table  4.1  to  determine  the  number  of  months  to  be  prorated  based  on  each  period  of consecutive days of nonflying.  (T-2). 4.3.5.3.  Commanders  will  restart  the  individual’s  training  cycle  at  a  prorated  share following IQT completion, if IQT is reaccomplished.  (T-2). 4.3.5.4.  Commanders will round off prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 1/2 to the next lower whole number, but do not prorate any requirement below 1.  (T-2). 4.3.5.5.  Commanders  will  ensure  for  prorating  purposes,  newly  assigned  or  converted aircrew and aircrew achieving qualification after the 15th of the month should be in CT on the 1st day of the following month.  (T-2).  Commanders will ensure events and sorties for the remainder of the training cycle are prorated.  (T-2). 4.3.5.6.  Commanders will not consider annual leave as non-availability.   Commanders may consider periods of cadet non-enrollment and extended periods of adverse weather or periods when the aircraft are not available for normal use (which preclude the unit from flying more than 15 days in a month) as non-availability.  (T-2). 4.3.6.  Failure to Complete Annual and Semiannual CT Requirements: 4.3.6.1.  Pilots who fail to complete semi-annual training requirements according to Table 4.3 will not fly in the new training cycle until a review is completed to determine the cause of the deficiency and if the pilot requires any additional training in the new training cycle.  (T-2).  If an IP fails to complete an ID sortie, then additional training must include the delinquent ID sortie prior to performing instructor duties.  (T-2). 4.3.6.2.  The FTG commander (or the AETC/A3V for an AETC FE) is the reviewer and waiver authority.  The reviewer should consider the type and magnitude of the deficiency and the pilot’s experience level to determine if additional training, increased supervision, or  a  waiver  to  the  previous  training  cycle  requirements  is  warranted.    Document  this waiver, with justification, in the individual’s training record.  (T-2). 4.3.6.3.  Refer to AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, for guidance on aviation service suspension. 4.3.7.  Multiple Qualification Requirements.  Pilots qualified in more than one unit-assigned aircraft will accomplish the maximum number of total sorties and events required (based on experience level) for the training cycle with at least one sortie in each aircraft every training cycle.  (T-2).  Credit ID sorties flown in either aircraft toward the ID sortie requirements of Table  4.4.    Pilots  qualified  in  other  than  unit-assigned  aircraft  will  complete  all  of  the requirements and maintain all of the currencies required by this chapter.  (T-2). 18 AFI11-2T-41-51-53V1  9 JUNE 2017 4.4.  Ground  Training  Requirements.  Initial  ground  training  accomplished  during  IQT  and MQT may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.  AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and Table 4.1 establish aircrew ground training requirements. For ground training prescribed by other AFIs, units must refer to those AFIs for the latest requirement.  (T-2). Table 4.1.  Pilot Ground Training Requirements.

Required before the first flight of the month. An unsatisfactory boldface exam results in grounding until successful reaccomplishment.  2.  Review each emergency procedure outlined in Section III of the aircraft flight manual with a qualified IP.  Preferably accomplish SEPT one on one.  However, small, flight- sized groups are allowed so all members can participate to the fullest extent and share equal time responding to emergency situations.  Teaching SEPT may satisfy semiannual SEPT requirement for the IP who administers the training.  SEPT may also be accomplished in a static aircraft, or in a cockpit trainer. 3.  Aircrew noncurrent for water survival training are limited to over-water operations to remain within gliding distance of land. 4.  AETC instructors who are overdue for the event is NMR and cannot fly with students until currency is regained. AFI11-2T-41-51-53V1  9 JUNE 2017 19 4.5.  Flying  Training  Requirements.  All  aircrew  will  maintain  currency  requirements  as applicable in Table 4.2 and sortie/event requirements in Table 4.3  (T-2).  The FTG/CC (or the AETC/A3V  for  an  AETC  flight  examiner)  will  be  waiver  authority  for  individual  aircrew requirements.    (T-2).    Document  waivers,  including  justification,  in  the  individual’s  training record.  (T-2).  For the purposes of flying training requirements, qualified (FP) USAFA Flying Team cadets will follow the BAQ requirements in Table 4.2 and Table 4.3. Table 4.2.  Pilot Currency Requirements.  4.5.1.  Restrictions.  Aircrew will not fly sorties, events, mission, and currency items in which they are not qualified, current, and certified.  (T-2). 4.5.2.  Currency and Recurrency.  Unless otherwise restricted, aircrew may log currencies during any sortie or mission if the maneuver or item is demonstrated.  Noncurrent aircrew members will not perform that sortie, mission, or event except for the purpose of regaining currency.    (T-2).    Unless  otherwise  specified,  supervisory  requirements  pertaining  to 20 AFI11-2T-41-51-53V1  9 JUNE 2017 recurrency will be satisfied in the flight position that offers best control of the mission, as determined by the squadron commander.  (T-2). 4.5.2.1.  Landing Currency.  Log a landing when performing any normal, no-flap, or full-flap (in the T-41 or T-51) landing.  (T-2).  A landing accomplished in any unit-assigned aircraft satisfies the landing event and currency requirement. Landing currency is necessary to  maintain  basic  aircraft  qualification.    Loss  of  landing  currency  exceeding  30  days requires the following action.  (Note: Timing starts from the last landing.): 4.5.2.1.1.  For  31  days through  90  Days  (inexperienced)  or  46  days through  90 days.  Pilots will regain landing currency by accomplishing three successful landings, including one each at no-flap and full-flap settings (if qualified in the T-41 or T-51), under the supervision of a current IP.  (T-2). 4.5.2.1.2.  For  91  to  135  Days.  Same  as  paragraph  4.5.2.1.1,  plus  an  instructor-supervised emergency procedure session (normal and emergency procedures). 4.5.2.1.3.  For 136 to 225 Days.  Same as paragraph 4.5.2.1.2, plus an IP-supervised ID sortie, qualification written examinations, and an emergency procedure evaluation (EPE).  AF Form 8 documentation is not required. 4.5.2.1.4.  For 226 Days to 39 Months at the End of a Nonflying Assignment or 51 Months at the End of any Active Flying Assignment.  Same as paragraph 4.5.2.1.3, plus a locally administered requalification program approved by the FTG commander, to include a qualification evaluation.  The unit will send an information copy of the approved training program to AETC/A3V.  (T-2).  For greater periods of time, see AFI 11-202, Volume 1.  (T-2). 4.5.2.2.  Simulated Forced Landing Currency.  If SFL currency is lost, aircrew will not fly without an SFL-current IP on board until currency is regained.  (T-2).  Currency may be regained by flying an SFL from high or low key with an SFL-current IP. 4.5.3.  Semiannual  Sortie/Event  Requirements.    Table  4.3  establishes  the  minimum semiannual sortie/event requirements for all qualified pilots.  Any pilot not meeting currency requirements will not perform the sortie or event except under the supervision of an IP.  (T-2).  (Exception: Flying team cadets who are noncurrent for a NIFA event may regain that currency with any certified flight trainer.)  Refer to Attachment 4 for guidance on logging sorties and events for currency and recurrency. AFI11-2T-41-51-53V1  9 JUNE 2017 21 Table 4.3.  Pilot Semi-Annual Sortie and Event Requirements.  22 AFI11-2T-41-51-53V1  9 JUNE 2017 Chapter 5 SPECIALIZED TRAINING 5.1.  General: 5.1.1.  Specialized  training  programs  upgrade  qualified  aircrew  members  to  navigation certified, mountain flying certified, instructor pilot, or other specialized mission skills.  Units may  tailor  other  than  formal  course  training  programs  for  all  crewmembers  based  on experience, currency, documented performance, and formal training. 5.1.2.  The squadron commander will approve entry into all specialized training programs and certify pilots following training completion.  (T-2).  Except where noted below, certifications for specialized training in any unit-assigned aircraft is valid for all unit-assigned aircraft. 5.1.3.  Except where a formal course is required, specific training guidance, procedures, policy, and requirements for specialized training are described in locally-developed syllabi.
