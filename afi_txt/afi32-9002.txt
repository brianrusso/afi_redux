Possible  effects  on  current  or  proposed  privatized  housing  (e.g.  if  the municipality  has  additional  tax(es)  or  regulatory  compliance  obligations  that  the  county may pass on to AF or residents in privatized housing under privatized housing contracts). 12 AFI32-9002  3 AUGUST 2017 3.2.2.7.  Possible effects on concessionaires or contractors (i.e., whether the municipality imposes  additional  taxes  (income,  sales,  gross  receipts,  utility,  property,  general employment or franchise taxes) or other costs (licensing and permitting fees) other than the county, and whether, under contract, these costs may be passed on to the AF). 3.2.2.8.

If  the  proposal  includes  (or  reasonably  could  include  in  the  future)  area(s) outside the installation, current zoning of such area(s) and an explanation of whether the proposed annexation may cause changes to the permitted land use in such area(s). 3.2.2.12.  Possible  adverse  effects  on  the  Installation  or  Installation  personnel  from municipal taxation, licensing, or other actions.  Note:  Special attention should be given to  the  potential  for  storm  water  fees  imposed  by  the  annexation  authority,  or  any  other State or local authority, under Section 313(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1323(c). 3.2.2.13.

The  litigation  review  from  AFLOA/JACE  and  the  annexation and evaluation report from the BCE will be combined at AFCEC/CIT and forwarded to SAF/IEI.  The  decision  on  whether  or  not  to  protest  a  proposed  annexation  will  be  made  by  SAF/IEI.  AFCEC/CIT has the responsibility to notify AFLOA/JACE of SAF/IEI’s determination.  (T-0). AFI32-9002  3 AUGUST 2017 13 Chapter 4 FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE JURISDICTION 4.1.  Federal Legislative Jurisdiction.  Does not apply to foreign holdings. 4.1.1.  The  RPO/REO  is  responsible  to  know  the  legislative  jurisdiction(s)  within  the installation boundary and retain documentation with maps in the land record file.    (T-1). 4.1.2.  Federal  legislative  jurisdiction  is  the  power  of  the  federal  government  to  pass  and enforce laws on matters that are ordinarily reserved for the States, such as crime prevention and enforcement and family laws.  It may also affect taxation and municipal services. 4.1.3.  Regardless  of  legislative  jurisdiction,  the  federal  government  has  many  powers  and immunities  in  federal  land  areas  (i.e.,  exemption  from  property  taxes,  Uniform  Code  of Military Justice (UCMJ) authority, etc.). 4.1.4.  In  most  cases,  the  State  continues  to  hold  the  right  to  serve  State  civil  or  criminal process (e.g., subpoena rights, warrant processes, etc.). 4.2.  Types of Federal Legislative Jurisdiction. 4.2.1.  Proprietorial  (or  Proprietary).    The  Federal  government  has  acquired  some  right  or title to  an area in  a State (fee simple, lease, easement, etc.) but  has not  obtained any of the State's  authority  to  legislate  over  the  area.    The  State  retains  all  jurisdiction  for  crime prevention  and  enforcement  (other  than  UCMJ  violations),  family  laws,  and  certain metropolitan services. 4.2.1.1.  This is the preferred jurisdiction unless the Federal government requires another jurisdiction to carry out the assigned mission. 4.2.2.  Partial.  The State grants the Federal government some of its authority to legislate but reserves the right to exercise, alone or with the Federal government, some authority beyond the right to serve criminal process in the area (for example, the right to tax private property).  The cession documentation will contain the reservations made by the State. 4.2.3.  Concurrent.  The State grants the Federal  government legislative jurisdiction over an area but has reserved to itself the right to exercise the same authority at the same time as long as  the  State  does  not  interfere  with  the  federal  mission.    This  may  be  the  preferred jurisdiction for a non-contiguous installation housing area, as one example.  This jurisdiction also currently exists in Alaska because of the special provisions in the Alaska Statehood Act. 4.2.4.  Exclusive.  The State grants all of the State's authority to the Federal government in an area.  Only Congress has authority to legislate in this area, and the Federal government has the  responsibility  for  law  enforcement  and  municipal  services  (trash  removal,  road maintenance, fire protection, etc.).  The right to vote or have access to State courts is limited by this jurisdiction. 4.3.  Changing Federal Legislative Jurisdiction. 4.3.1.  Each  State  has  its  own  unique  process  for  ceding  and  retroceding  legislative jurisdiction. 14 AFI32-9002  3 AUGUST 2017 4.3.1.1.  When  federal  legislative  jurisdiction  is  required  over  property  where  there  is none  (proprietorial),  the  government  must  request  the  state  cede  (give)  its  powers  over the  property  to  the  federal  government.    (T-0).    Reference  40  USC  §  3112,  Federal Jurisdiction 4.3.1.2.  Changing  federal  legislative  jurisdiction  from  exclusive  to  another  jurisdiction requires  the  government  to  request  the  state  retrocede  (take  back)  some  or  all  of  its powers  over  the  property.      Reference  10  USC  §  2683,  Relinquishment  of  Legislative Jurisdiction 4.3.2.  To  request  change  in  jurisdiction,  Installation  Commander  is  responsible  to  submit request  and  support  documentation  to  AFCEC/CIT  to  staff  through  SAF/IEI  to  State Governor for action.  (T-0). 4.3.2.1.  ANG  Installation  Commander  is  responsible  to  submit  request  and  support documentation to NGB.  NGB will submit to AFCEC/CIT for further processing.  (T-0). 4.3.3.  After state grants jurisdiction change, RPO/REO is responsible to ensure notification of  change  is  provided  to  local  US  Attorney  and  the  US  Department  of  Justice,  Criminal Division, Policy and Statutory Enforcement Unit, Office of Enforcement Operation.  (T-1). AFI32-9002  3 AUGUST 2017 15 Chapter 5 REAL PROPERTY INTERESTS IN FOREIGN NATIONS 5.1.  Responsibilities.  To  the  extent  they  do  not  contradict  the  Status  of  Forces  Agreement (SOFA) or respective bilateral agreement governing the property, the responsibilities in Chapter 1 apply to all AF real property interests held in foreign nations.  (T-0). 5.2.  Land  Management.  Chapter  2  requirements  apply  to  Installations  and  sites  in  foreign nations with the following exceptions: 5.2.1.  Installation boundary surveys will: 5.2.1.1.  Be IAW the SOFA, or respective bilateral agreement, in a nationally recognized format,  performed  by  a  surveyor  certified  by  a  national  surveying  organization  or meeting nationally accepted standards, whichever is greater, or by a surveyor certified in the US.  (T-0). 5.2.1.2.  A  copy  of  the  installation  boundary  survey  will  be  filed  with  local  authorities IAW the SOFA or respective bilateral agreement, or lacking these, with the appropriate local authorities.  This also applies to surveys for easement and lease ingrants with terms greater than 20 years.  (T-0). 5.2.2.  Annual  boundary  inspections  are  required.    Encroachments  discovered  during  an annual  boundary  inspection  will  be  resolved  IAW  the  SOFA  or  respective  bilateral agreement governing the property.  (T-0). 5.2.3.  Real  property  determined  excess  to  DoD  needs  will  be  reported  excess  IAW  DoDI 4165.69,  Realignment  of  DoD  Sites  Overseas,  CJCSI  2300.02J,  Coordination  of  Overseas Force  Structure  Changes  and  Host-Nation  Notification,  CJCSI  2300.03D,  Realignment  Of Overseas  Sites;  AFI  10-504,  Overseas  Force  Structure  Changes  and  Host  Nation Notification, the SOFA or respective bilateral  agreement  and in  coordination with  the State Department.  (T-0). 5.2.4.  When  considering  vacating  leased  property,  take  prompt  action  to  relocate  AF  and DoD activities in leased building space into DoD consigned Host Nation installation, and to dispose of excess leaseholds IAW the SOFA, or respective bilateral agreement.  (T-0). 5.2.5.  Outgranting property will be done to the extent allowable by the SOFA or respective bilateral  agreement.    Applications  for  outgrants  affecting  land  or  water  uses  in  the  coastal zone will be processed IAW the SOFA, or respective bilateral agreement.  Where the SOFA, or respective bilateral agreement, and this AFI are not in agreement, the SOFA or respective bilateral agreement shall prevail.  (T-0). 5.3.  Managing  Real  Property  Facilities.  Chapter  2  requirements  apply  to  installations  and sites in foreign nations with the following exceptions: 5.3.1.  Follow  the  SOFA  or  respective  bilateral  agreement  guidance  for  submitting environmental documentation.   In addition  to  the environmental documents  required by the SOFA  or  respective  bilateral  agreement,  an  Environmental  Baseline  Survey  (EBS)  will  be required  IAW  32-7066,  Environmental  Baseline  Surveys  in  Real  Property  Transactions.    (T-0). AFI32-9002  3 AUGUST 2017 5.3.2.  Annual  outgrant  compliance  inspections  are  required.    Follow  the  guidance  in  the SOFA  or  respective  bilateral  agreement  in  resolving  encroachments.    Where  the  SOFA  or respective  bilateral  agreement  and  this  AFI  are  not  in  agreement,  the  SOFA  or  respective bilateral agreement will prevail.

Property ownership does not change; however, taxation and municipal services (trash removal, fire and police protection services, schools, etc.)  may change. Boundary Survey—A study made by a certified surveyor to define or to redefine the perimeter (boundary  line)  of  the  installation  property  or  to  obtain  data  for  constructing  a  map  or  plat showing a boundary line. Caretaker—The continued security and maintenance of a vacant facility or facilities scheduled for disposal or demolition so as not to deteriorate the facility further than normal wear and tear. Changed  Use—A  change  in  the  use  of  a  facility  or  part  of  a  facility  that  does  not  need conversion; such a change in use exceeds one year. Continental United States (CONUS)—United States territory, including the adjacent territorial waters, located within the North American Continent between Canada and Mexico. Conversion—For  purposes  of  this  instruction  only,  a  structural  alteration  of  a  real  property facility to provide for a use other than the one it was originally designed (or later converted) for, thereby making the original or converted AF design obsolete. Excess  Property—Any  property  under  the  control  of  any  Federal  executive  agency  that  is  not required for the agency’s needs or the discharge of its responsibilities, as determined by the head of the agency pursuant to 40 U.S.C. § 483. Facility—In  this  AFI,  facility  refers  to  any  real  property  (structure,  building,  or  linear  asset  to include any non-equity asset) that is not bare land. Fair Market Value—The amount in cash, or on terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which the  property  would  be  sold  by  an  owner  willing,  but  not  obligated  to  sell,  to  a  purchaser  who desires, but is not obligated, to buy.

In determining need, consider the purpose to be served, the problem to be solved, and the end to be achieved.  A requirement does not necessarily identify or describe the needed property; it states why the property is needed, and how the property is to be used. Remaining Economic Life—The value to the government in terms of time.  (Such value ceases when  the  property  becomes  unsuitable  or  uneconomical  for  its  designed  use  because  of depreciation or obsolescence.) Substitute  Real  Property—Property that can serve or is  economically suited to  the use of the property  it  replaces.    (When  determining  the  practicality  of  substituting  real  property,  consider value, suitability, cost of operation and maintenance, and physical condition.) Temporary  Changed  Use—A change in  the use of a facility or part of a facility, in effect  for three years or less.  Modifications must be clearly reversible to previous configuration. Underutilized  Property—An  entire  property  or  portion  of  a  property  that  is  not  occupied  or used  for  current  program  purposes  of  the  accountable  agency  or  property  that  is  occupied  in caretaker status  only.
