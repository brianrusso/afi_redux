The format  has  changed  to  improve  clarity  and  organization  in  the  Directive.    Additionally,  former paragraphs 10, 11, 12, and former Attachment 1, (including Figures A1.1. and A1.2.) have been deleted  in  accordance  with  the  requirement  in  AFPD  90-1,  Policy  Formulation,  to  remove metrics from Policy Directives.  Former Attachment 3 has been deleted.  Former Attachment 2 is now Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Documents. 1.  Overview.  Law  and  policy  regulate  the  activities  that  Air  Force  personnel  may  undertake.  As such, installation commanders must be informed of the legal bases for restricting activities of individuals in order to maintain good order and discipline.  Commanders must also be aware of their responsibilities for complaints made under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  This  directive  establishes policies related to  prohibited activities on Air  Force  reservations;  the prosecution  of  civilian  criminal  offenses  committed  on  Air  Force  installations;  and  the  timely and equitable consideration of Article 138, UCMJ complaints.  This Directive does not address grievances  from  non-bargaining  civilian  employees  or  from  employees  represented  by  an exclusively recognized union, both of which are addressed in AFPD 36-7, Employee and Labor-Management Relations. 2.  Policy.  It is Air Force policy to:   2  AFPD51-9  30 JULY 2015 2.1.  Prohibit  any  person  holding  any  office  of  profit  or  trust  under  the  United  States  from accepting gifts of more than minimal value from foreign governments without the consent of the Congress.  Air Force military and civilian personnel (including experts and consultants) and  their  spouses  and  dependents  may  only  accept  gifts  from  foreign  governments  as authorized by Title 5, United States Code (USC), Section 7342, and according to instructions implementing this Directive. 2.2.  Maintain  political  neutrality.    Air  Force  members  on  active  duty  (10  U.S.C.  §  101), including  members  of  the  Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard,  must  not  engage  in political activities on or off duty that are prohibited by Federal law or DoD regulations.  Air Force  civilian  political  activity  is  governed  by  the  Hatch  Act,  5.  U.S.C.  §§  7321-7326,  as well as by criminal statutes found at 18 U.S.C. §§ 601-610. 2.3.  Prohibit demonstrations or other activities within an Air Force installation which could interfere  with  or  prevent  the  orderly  accomplishment  of  the  installation  mission,  or  which present a clear danger to loyalty, discipline, or the morale of members of the Armed Forces. 2.4.  Ensure all Air Force personnel comply with the provisions of 10 U.S.C. § 976 and DoDI 1354.01  regarding  collective  bargaining  and  labor-management  negotiations  between members of the Air Force and their military and civilian superiors. 2.5.  Seek  trial  in  U.S.  district  court  or  U.S.  magistrate  court,  according  to  the  Federal  law and instructions implementing this Directive, for civilians who commit offenses in violation of  federal  law  on  United  States  Air  Force  reservations  where  the  United  States  has  either exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. 2.6.  Ensure Air Force commanders act on Article 138, UCMJ, complaints submitted by Air Force  members;  grant  redress  where  warranted;  and    process  such  complaints  according  to  instructions  implementing  this  Directive.    Article  138,  UCMJ,  rights,  policies,  and procedures  apply  only  to  Air  Force  members  who  are  subject  to  the  UCMJ  at  the  time  the alleged offending action was taken. 3.  Roles and Responsibilities. 3.1.  Air  Force  commanders  are  responsible  for  maintaining  good  order  and  discipline.  Under  certain  circumstances,  this  may  necessitate  restricting  the  activities  and  access  of individuals.    Before  implementing  such  restrictions,  commanders  should  consult  with  their servicing Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). 3.2.  The  Judge  Advocate  General  (TJAG),  Headquarters  U.S.  Air  Force  (AF/JA),  shall  be responsible for interpreting this directive and its implementing instructions. 3.3.  The  Office  of  the  Air  Force  General  Counsel  (SAF/GC)  is  responsible  for  providing legal  advice  related  to  the  Hatch  Act.    SAF/GC  shall  be  responsible  for  interpreting  the applicability  of  5  USC  §§  7321-7326  and  criminal  statutes  at  18  USC  §§  601-610  to  Air Force employees.   AFPD51-9  30 JULY 2015   3  3.4.  Installation SJAs shall be responsible for providing advice and counsel to commanders regarding  the  legal  bases  for  a  particular  restriction  and  to  ensure  an  appropriate  balance between individual civil liberties and good order and discipline on an installation.
