When money or negotiable instruments are offered, advise theprospective donor to retain custody until official acceptance of the gift.

If an authorized officer later determines that the gift cannot beaccepted, refund the money or value of the negotiable instruments upon endorsement to the prospectivedonor. The Air Force will not pay interest on money or the value of negotiable instruments returned to aprospective donor according to this instruction. If the Air Force assumes custody of gifts other thanmoney or negotiable instruments, inform the donor in writing that the Air Force cannot assume responsi-bility for any loss or damage to the gift before it is officially accepted.

Authorized persons below the Secretarial level, as provided in paragraphs 1.3. through 1.6., are also authorized to accept conditional gifts. When in doubt that the value of the gift, or the cost of accepting and maintaining it, is within limits permitting acceptance below the Secretarial level, the person receiving the gift offer will process the offer to the Secretarial level. The person who accepts a gift below secretarial level will submit a copy of the letter accepting the gift to the appropriate functional activities. See paragraph 3.11.3.10.6. Summarize the item’s significance to the Air Force. Include the recommendation of the installa-tion commander (or equivalent) transmitting the offer (and any intermediate commander’s coordination) for acceptance or rejection.30AFI51-601   26 NOVEMBER 2003IC 2003-L TO AFI 51-601, GIFTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCEAttachment 7 26 NOVEMBER 2003 SUMMARY OF REVISIONS This interim change (IC) 2003-l changes the OPR responsible for receiving and distributing gifts to: 1) persons in overseas commands, and 2) military personnel or employees of more than one MAJCOM. 5.3.1. Gifts offered to the Air Force for distribution to Air Force members and employees must be accepted or rejected by the Secretary of the Air Force, or designee, in compliance with the provisions of paragraphs 1.1. through 1.6. of this instruction. The total value of the gift will be used to determine the authority for accepting or rejecting gifts processed under this Chapter. (For example, if the total value of a gift is less than $50,000, the commander of a major command (or his delegee), the commander of a field operating agency, or the commander of an Air Force medical treatment facility may accept or reject the gift, regardless of the cost of items to be distributed to individual personnel or employees.) Note: Before accepting proposed gifts that would be distri-buted under the procedures of paragraph 5.3.4., below, coor-dinate with the Commander, Air Force Services Agency, in order to determine whether acceptance would be in the best interest of the Air Force. 5.3.4. After acceptance, the Commander, Air Force Services Agency is designated to receive gifts from persons or organizations in the United States for distribution to overseas commands, and for CONUS dis-tribution when gifts are intended for military personnel or employees of more than one MAJCOM. The Commander, Air Force Services Agency is also responsible for determining the method of distribution. 5.5.1.1. Gifts for Distribution in the CONUS. The distribution point or points designated by the receiv-ing commander or Commander, Air Force Services Agency. 5.5.1.2. Gifts for Distribution in Overseas Commands. The port of embarkation or other coastal activ-ity designated by the Commander, Air Force Services Agency, or to the point designated by the receiving overseas commander.
