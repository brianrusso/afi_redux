General.  Those  who  use  this  instruction  should  bear  in  mind  that  an  infinite  number  of variations  are  available  and  that  the  cargo  compartment  configurations  listed  here  are  the  most typical  encountered  day-to-day.   This  instruction  establishes  basic  cargo  compartment configuration, standard equipment, and equipment locations aboard EC/MC-130J aircraft, minus any  electronic  modifications  installed  that  affect  weight  and  balance.    Some  EC/MC-130J aircraft have additional equipment installed that may affect configuring the aircraft as listed.  For operational planning purposes, each configuration has an average time annotated and number of personnel  to  configure  the  airplane.    The  times  quoted  are  approximate  figures  and  are configuration  times  only.    They  do  not  include  de-configuration  times.    For  example, reconfiguring from a P-1 configuration, 84 sidewall and center-aisle seats to a C-1 configuration (clean  floor)  requires  more  than  one-half  hour  for  one  person,  which  is  the  time  allocated  to configure a C-1 configuration. 1.2.  Waivers.  Waiver  authority  for  the  contents  of  this  document  is  AF/A3O.    IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  the  MAJCOM/A3  is  the  waiver  authority  for  operational  procedure  requirements.  Waiver  requests  should  be  submitted  through  MAJCOM  Standardization  and  Evaluation channels to the A3.  As applicable, MAJCOM/A3 will forward requests to AF/A3O, with an info copy to AF/A3OI. 1.2.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. 1.2.1.1.  “Tier 0”  (T-0) requirement is external to the Air Force and consequence of non-compliance is determined by respective non-AF authority.  Requests for waivers must be processed through command channels to publication OPR for consideration. 1.2.1.2.  “Tier  1”    (T-1)  non-compliance  puts  Airmen,  commanders,  or  the  USAF strongly  at  risk  of  mission  or  program  failure,  death,  injury,  legal  jeopardy  or unacceptable, fraud, waste or abuse. Waiver authority is the MAJCOM/CC (Delegable no lower  than  the  MAJCOM  Director)  with  concurrence  of  the  publication’s  Approving Official. 1.2.1.3.  “Tier  2”    (T-2)  non-compliance  may  degrade  mission  or  program  effectiveness or  efficiency  and  has  potential  to  create  moderate  risk  of  mission  or  program  failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable, fraud, waste or abuse.  Waiver authority is the MAJCOM/CC (Delegable no lower than the MAJCOM Director). 1.2.1.4.  “Tier  3”    (T-3)  non-compliance  may  limit  mission  or  program  effectiveness  or efficiency  and  has  a  relatively  remote  potential  to  create  risk  of  mission  or  program failure,  death,  injury,  legal  jeopardy  or  unacceptable,  fraud,  waste  or  abuse.    Waiver authority is the Wing/CC (Delegable no lower than Group/CC or equivalent). 1.3.  Roles  and  Responsibilities.  Operational  plans  must  consider  the  most  appropriate configuration that satisfies mission requirements and permits the minimum amount of variations and  man-hours  to  change.    USAF  units  performing  services  on  EC/MC-130J  aircraft  (i.e., maintenance,  aerial  port,  and  aircrew  flight  equipment)  are  responsible  for  configuring  the aircraft  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  this  instruction  and  as  outlined  in  mission  directives,  to   6  AFI11-2EC-MC-130JV3_ADDA-A  28 JULY 2015 include  equipment  stowage/installation  IAW  the  configuration  and  equipment  tables.    Aircrew Flight  Equipment  (AFE)  personnel  will  ensure  all  life  support  equipment  is  positioned  on  the aircraft  to  meet  mission  requirements  IAW  Table  1.1.    Maintenance  personnel  will  ensure  all required  and  mission  specific  equipment  is  positioned  aboard  the  aircraft  to  meet  mission requirements  IAW  Tables  2.1  and  2.2.  Some equipment  listed in  Table  2.2 is  roll-on/roll-off equipment controlled by unit designated personnel.  Before home station departure, maintenance personnel are responsible for configuring the aircraft (including modifications) to meet mission requirements  IAW  Figures  3.1  thru  3.21.    For  the  CP-2  through  CP-5  configurations,  the sidewall  seats  will  be  stowed  to  facilitate  preflight  of  the  Enhanced  Cargo  Handling  System (ECHS)  rails  and  then  lowered  by  aircrew  with  maintenance  assistance.    After  departure  from home  station, the  aircrew  will  accomplish  all  configurations  with  assistance  by maintenance/aerial  port  personnel  if  available.    During  preflight,  aircrew  will  ensure  required mission equipment has been provided and is properly installed.  When the aircraft configuration is not completed prior to aircrew show time, the loadmaster will assist in the completion of the configuration,  after  accomplishing  required  predeparture  duties  (i.e.,  preflight,  loading,  etc.).  Loadmasters have overall responsibility for configuration management and proper installation of equipment on the aircraft. 1.4.  Standard Configuration Codes.  Use the following codes when referring to EC/MC-130J cargo compartment configurations. 1.4.1.  AE – Aeromedical Evacuation. 1.4.2.  C – Cargo. 1.4.3.  CP – Cargo and Passengers. 1.4.4.  LP – PSYOP. 1.4.5.  P – Passengers. 1.4.6.  RAPID – Infil/Exfil Equipment or Personnel. 1.4.7.  TAC – Tactical Airdrop Cargo. 1.4.8.  TAP – Tactical Airdrop Paratroop. 1.5.  Modifications.  Configuration  codes  of  this  instruction  may  require  modifications  for  a specific  mission.    Each  modification  must  be  carefully  evaluated  prior  to  mission  operation  to ensure maximum flight safety and aircraft equipment compatibility.  Each mission directive will identify  basic  configuration  codes  and  modifications  to  satisfy  mission  requirements.    For example,  an  aeromedical  evacuation  mission  may  require  more  litters  than  available  in configuration  AE-1.    Consult  appropriate  configuration  charts  to  determine  where  the  desired additional  litters  can  be  installed  and  which  seats  must  be  removed.    Indicate  in  the  mission directive,  by  position  (left  or  right,  and  number)  which  seats  are  deleted  and  (by  alphabetical position) litter tier provisions are installed.  Example:  Configuration AE-1(Mod), remove seats 12, 13, 14, and 15 left and right, install litter tier provisions C and D. 1.6.  Weight and Balance. 1.6.1.  Configuration  equipment  and  necessary  supply  changes  affect  aircraft  weight  and balance.  To standardize equipment quantities and location, items shown in Table 2.1 will be included  in  the  aircraft  basic  weight  and  remain  on  the  aircraft  except  for  maintenance, AFI11-2EC-MC-130JV3_ADDA-A  28 JULY 2015   7  inspection,  and  when  directed  by  this  instruction.    Equipment  listed  in  Tables  1.1  and  2.2 will  be  added  as  necessary  when  computing  the  weight  and  balance  and  entered  in Communications/Navigation/Identification-Management Unit (CNI-MU) and references 5, 6, or  7  of  DD  Form  365-4,  Weight  and  Balance  Clearance  Form  F-Transport/Tactical.    The loadmaster will enter the weight contained in the required equipment table for the applicable configuration in the CNI-MU and when preparing the DD Form 365-4.  Adjustments will be made when the actual onboard weight of these items vary from the data shown.  Add aircraft armor to  the Chart C, to include partial or full installation.   If changes in configuration are done  off  station  and  MX  personnel  are  not  available  to  update  the  chart  C  account  for changes  in  armor  on    (Table  4.3)  the  DD  Form  365-4  if  armor  is  installed  on  the  aircraft.  Paratroop  door  armor  moments  need  to  be  recalculated  when  armor  is  repositioned.  DD Form 365-4 will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5 of this instruction. 1.6.2.  When a configuration change that removes items listed in Table 2.1 is accomplished at a Forward Operating Location (FOL) and no Quality Assurance (QA) Branch weight and balance authority is deployed to the location, maintenance personnel will put an information note  in  the  Air  Force  Technical  Order  (AFTO) Form  781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and Work Document, indicating the weight, fuselage station and moment of any equipment added or removed.  The loadmaster will add or subtract the listed weight and moment from the last entry  in  the  DD  Form  365-3, Basic  Weight and  Balance Record, Chart  C-Basic.  Annotate the  new  weight  and  moment  in  Block  1  of  DD Form  365-4.    Configuration  changes accomplished  at  home  station  require  a  QA  update  to  the  DD  Form  365-3,  Chart  C.  Exception:    Minor  equipment  changes  after  crew  reporting  may  be  annotated  on  the DD Form 3654 by the loadmaster. 1.7.  Distribution.  Commanders are responsible for bringing this publication to the attention of all  affected  personnel.    At  least  one  copy  (paper  or  electronic)  will  be  maintained  in  the  unit operations section.  It will be readily accessible to operations and aircrew personnel.  Additional distribution will be as follows:  (T-2) 1.7.1.  Staff  Operations, all levels. 1.7.2.  All levels of aircrew standardization offices. 1.7.3.  Command posts/operation centers. 1.7.4.

HQ AFSOC/A3V  will  forward  changes  to  AF/A3O  with  an  information  copy  to AF/A3OI for final approval prior to implementation. 1.10.  Aircrew  Life  Support  Equipment  Configuration.  EC/MC-130J aircraft are configured with  standard  quantities  of  Aircrew  Life  Support  Equipment  (ALSE)  IAW  this  instruction.  Configure aircraft as listed in Table 1.1.  During aircraft contingency/deployment generations, it is imperative that aircraft deploy with the full complement of ALSE.  This equipment must be at forward operating locations to allow maximum mission flexibility when aircraft are away from home station.  In the event installed ALSE inspection dates expire while the aircraft is on alert status or away from the operating location, place these items in the AFTO Form 781A on a red dash  until  the  aircraft  goes  off  alert  or  returns  to  the  operating  location.    When  the  aircraft  is released  from  alert  or  returns  to  the  operating  location,  upgrade  to  a  Red  X  IAW  Technical Order(s)  TO  00-20-1,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance  Inspection,  Documentation,  Policies, and Procedures. 1.10.1.  Aircraft  Transfer  Requirements.    When  transferring  aircraft;  position  ALSE  IAW permanent  transfer  configuration.    Losing  unit  will  contact  the  gaining  organization’s  AFE section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records.  The gaining  organization  will  conduct  an  acceptance  inspection  and  forward  a  copy  of discrepancies,  to  include  any  equipment  shortages,  to  their  respective  Major  Command (MAJCOM)  IAW  TO 00201.    Without  documented  coordination  and  approval,  do  not transfer  aircraft with  less than the required equipment.  The losing organization must make up any shortages from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.  (T-2) 1.10.2.  ALSE  Stowage  Bins  and  Racks.    Handle  ALSE  with  care  to  avoid  damage  to  the equipment.    ALSE  will  always  be  placed  in  the  stowage  bins,  unless  stowed  elsewhere  for aircraft CG limitations.  The primary purpose of all life support stowage bins and racks are for ALSE.  Oil, hydraulic fluid or other liquids will not be placed in the stowage bins.  (T-2) 1.10.3.  The  unit  or  service  being  airdropped  will  furnish  the  required  number  of  life preservers for airdrop of personnel over or near bodies of water.  Wear of flotation devices will be in accordance with this instruction and user service directives. Table 1.1.  Aircraft Installed Aircrew Life Support Equipment Configuration.

General.  This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configuration in floor plan format and  weight,  location,  and  moment  data  for  associated  required  equipment.    The  following configurations  apply  to  the  MC-130J  and  the  slick  EC-130J.    Exception:    EC-130J  with electronic modification packages installed. 3.2.  Configuration.  Although basic configuration modifications are authorized to meet special requirements, the following factors shall be considered: 3.2.1.  Single  sidewall  seats  shall  not  be  used  unless  connected  to  a  double  sidewall  seat (except for specific configurations). 3.2.2.  Passengers/ambulatory  patients  may  not  be  seated  closer  than  30  inches  in  front  of palletized, netted cargo or cargo secure with straps.  This does not apply to cargo restrained by chains/chain  bridle assemblies.  When palletized or non-palletized cargo is  secured with aircraft tie-down chains, the 30-inch spacing is not required.    Exception:  Always maintain the 30-inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying litters.  (T-2) 3.2.3.  Normal  spacing  for  paratroopers  is  24  inches;  however,  spacing  will  be  as  mission dictates.  Aircraft without accommodations for 24-inch spacing may be configured in 20-inch spacing. 3.2.4.  Cargo  height  in  pallet  position  two  may  be  restricted  if  overhead  equipment  rack(s) protrude into the cargo area.  This restriction will be 76 inches and will begin at the inboard side of the cargo handling system rails and extend inboard 12 inches.  This restriction could be on either or both sides of the aircraft. 3.2.5.  For  flight,  the  aircraft  ramp’s  cargo  weight  limit  is  5,000  pounds  of  floor  loaded  or palletized  cargo  in  pallet  position  six  (to  include  the  weight  of  pallet  and  nets).    See TO 1C130(M)J-9  or  TO 1C130J-9  for  other  restrictions.    Note:    The  addition  of  aircraft defensive systems, armor, and other modifications may result in an empty/light aircraft out of center of gravity (CG) limits.  Move equipment as required to remain within TO 1C130(M)J-1, MC-130J Flight Manual, or TO 1C130(E)J-1, EC-130J Flight Manual, limits as required.  Weight for this equipment is in Table 4.3 and 4.4. 3.2.6.  This chapter’s drawings are not drawn precisely to scale with respect to actual aircraft locations. 3.2.7.  A  20-inch  clear  area  is  required  on  the  forward  right  side  of  a  ramp  pallet  to  allow access to aft latrine facilities.  A safety aisle is required in pallet positions three, four, and six.  (Paragraph 4.2.3, Figure 4.1).  (T-2) 3.2.8.  Trashcans, other than integral containers, may be carried. 3.2.9.  Seats 1 and 2, left side will be stowed to allow unrestricted flight deck/crew entrance door access when the seats are not needed to accomplish a specific mission. AFI11-2EC-MC-130JV3_ADDA-A  28 JULY 2015   19  3.2.10.  Configuration  seat  totals  include  seats  designated  for  loadmasters.   If  the Loadmaster/Scanner Restraint System seats are installed, the red seats immediately forward of the paratroop doors will not be available for use. 3.2.11.  ECHS lock/seat stanchion locations are provided in Table 4.5. to their installation. litter tiers  adjacent 3.2.12.  Aeromedical  evacuation  (AE)  configurations.    Medical  Crew  Directors  (MCD)  and Charge  Medical  Technician  (CMT)  will  determine  final  litter  equipment  configuration  and Aeromedical  Evacuation  Crew  Member  (AECM)  seating.    AECM  seat  locations  may  vary based on patient/cabin observation requirements.  Overhead equipment racks, missile defense system modifications, and secure voice communication systems will decrease litter capacity in to  six  seats  are  required  for AECM/loadmaster(s) depending on crew complement.  Seats are numbered for identification from  front  to  rear  and  will  be  referred  to  as  seat  1-left,  or  seat  1-right,  etc.    Litter  tiers  are identified  alphabetically  and  litter  spaces  identified  numerically  from  lowest  (1)  to  highest (5).  On litter tier configuration illustrations, the number in parentheses indicates total litters per tier.  Roller conveyers will be stowed where litters and seats are rigged.  AE equipment, which may be secured in unused seats if floor space is limited, may reduce seat availability.  Portable  Therapeutic  Liquid  Oxygen  (PTLOX)  shall  be  stowed  in  a  location  to  prevent contact  with  fuels  or  hydraulic  fluids.    Note:    Five  portable  oxygen  bottles/PBE  will  be available for AE personnel on AE configurations.  (T2)   Up 3.2.13.  Aircraft protective armor will be added as needed into the Chart C, or, if QA is not available,  maintenance personnel will annotate a Note in the AFTO 781A with actual weight and moment installed.  Aircraft armor will not be floor loaded loose.  For all flights it must be  installed  at  its  designated  location.    Exception:  for  operational  requirements  individual pieces  of  armor  may  be  moved  for  specific  mission  requirements,  but  will  be  re-installed after the need to remove it is no longer present (example – paratroop door armor removed to facilitate a personnel airdrop).  (T-2) 3.2.14.  Some aircraft may be nose heavy due to armor installation and other modifications.  Actual amount of passengers/litter patients/paratroopers/cargo allowed onboard may vary as determined by aircraft center of gravity limitations. 3.2.15.  When  seating  passengers  next  to  cargo,  consideration  should  be  given  to  cargo (palletized/rolling  stock)  size  and  adequate  passenger  legroom.    For  cargo  width  up  to  76 inches, passengers may be seated on both sides.  For widths 77-96 inches, passengers may be seated on one side if the cargo is offset to one side laterally.  For widths 97 inches or greater, no passengers will be seated next to the cargo.  For cargo positioned within the wheel-well area:  Cargo width up to 52 inches, passengers may be seated on both sides; for widths 53-72 inches, passengers may be seated on one side of cargo if offset; and for widths 73 inches and greater, no passengers will be seated in the wheel-well.  (T-2) 3.3.  Troop Life Preserver.  If paratroopers are jumping near or over large bodies of water, the service  being  airdropped  will  furnish  required  life  preservers.    However,  life  preservers,  as indicated  in  applicable  configurations,  will  still  be  provided  as  required  to  cover  emergency ditching operations. 3.4.  Crew/Passenger/Troop  Drinking  Water.  Each  basic  configuration  provides  for  an adequate  amount of  drinking water.  For example, a two-gallon water container will always be   20  AFI11-2EC-MC-130JV3_ADDA-A  28 JULY 2015 provided;  and  for  missions  requiring  more  water  in  accordance  with  Table  5.3,  additional containers  are  available.    Table  5.3  is  provided  to  assist  in  determining  water  quantities. However, the table is not provided as an absolute requirement and should not be used to  cause mission delay or refusal to airlift passengers.  At no time will a mission be flown with no water on board.  Note:  When deploying to an austere environment or locations where a potable water source is unavailable, ensure a sufficient amount of water is onboard to complete the mission. 3.5.

This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning. 4.2.  Emergency  Exits  and  Safety  Aisles.  Load  aircraft  in  such  a  manner  that  the  following emergency exits and safety aisles are available: 4.2.1.  Equipment  will  not  be  positioned  in  a  manner  that  obstructs  the  side  emergency escape hatches.  An obstruction is any equipment that prevents the effective means of rapid evacuation.    Litters  and  seats  erected  across  an  emergency  exit  are  not  considered  to  be  an obstruction. 4.2.2.  One  unobstructed  emergency  exit  will  be  available  for  each  20  passengers/troops (This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for egress).  (T-2) 4.2.3.  When passengers are being airlifted, an unobstructed aisle way will be maintained in the wheel-well to provide access to emergency exits.  In the wheel-well area, the aisle way will be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft and will  begin  at  the  cargo  floor  or  Cargo  Handling  System  (CHS)  outboard  frame.    Tie-down equipment  (463L  nets,  straps,  chains,  and  devices)  shall  not  normally  be  considered  an obstruction.  The CHS outboard frame provides  8 inches of the 14-inch requirement on the main cargo floor (Figure 4.1).  In the ramp area, the aisle way will be a minimum of 8 inches beginning at the outboard edge of the CHS outboard frame.  The aisle way should normally be on the left side of the aircraft.  If the aisle way is placed on the right side of the aircraft, then clearance to the right side of the aircraft must be maintained.  Additionally, access to aft latrine facilities requires a 20-inch clear area on the forward right side of cargo loaded on the ramp.    During  combat/contingency  operations  aisle  ways  must  be  maintained  to  the maximum extent possible to provide access to all emergency exits.  If a minimum aisle way of 14-inches cannot be maintained in the wheel  well, one unobstructed emergency exit will be available for every 20 combat troops.  (T-2) 4.2.4.  If  the  aisle  way  requirement  in  Paragraph  4.2.3  cannot  be  achieved  on  missions carrying  crew  only  or  Mission  Essential  Personnel  (MEP)  authorized  by  operations order/plan  or  Director,  Mobility  Forces  (DIRMOBFOR),  then  an  aisle  way  will  be maintained in the wheel-well area that provides a minimum of 14 inches between the outer edge  of the floor/pallet/platform  or  a  minimum  of  30  inches  between  the  outer  edge  of  cargo  and  the aircraft  beginning  no  higher  than  60  inches  above  the  floor/pallet/platform.

The loadmaster is responsible for entering weight and balance data into the CNI-MU Wt and Bal pages, and transferring that information onto the DD Form 365-4, Form-F.  This  can  either  be  accomplished  manually  or  electronically  utilizing  the  Automated  Form  F (AFF) program and printer.  Instructions for use of the AFF program can be found in the C-130 AFF training guide. 5.2.  Load  Planning.  The  cargo  load  must  be  planned  so  the  center  of  gravity  of  the  loaded aircraft  will  be  within  the  specified  forward  and  aft  limits  for  any  given  operating  condition. Consideration  must  also  be  given  to  offload  sequence,  aircraft  limitations,  and  emergency jettisoning.    Math  charts  contained  in  TO  1C-130(M)J-5-1,  or  1C-130J-5-1,  Basic  Weight Checklist and TO 1C-130(M)J-5-2, or 1C-130J-5-2, Loading Data Manual, are tools, which may be  used  for  load  planning.    When  the  fuel  load  is  unknown,  load  plan  for  a  20-22  percent  of Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC) zero fuel. 5.3.  General  Instructions.  These  instructions  apply  to  Transport  Form  F  using  simplified moments.  Copy the information from the CNI-MU weight and balance pages onto the Form F, plus  the  heading  information.    A  copy  of  the  completed  DD  Form  365-4,  Form  F,  shall  be attached to the flight plan, or given to the controlling ground agency, quality assurance, transient alert, maintenance, etc.  (T-2) 5.3.1.  DD  Form  365-4  Heading.    Enter  date,  mission  number,  aircraft  type,  serial  number, departure and destination station (name or International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) identifier), home station of aircraft, and pilot's rank and last name. 5.3.2.  Limitations  Column.    Enter  the  appropriate  weight  and  CG  limits  for  the  planned mission using the following criteria:  The maximum gross weight and center of gravity limits specified  in  TO  1C-130(M)J-1  or  TO  1C-130(E)J-1  will  not  be  exceeded.    Gross  weights may also  be limited by  operating conditions; i.e., obstacle clearance, rate of climb,  weather conditions,  altitude,  runway/taxiway  bearing  capacity,  or  any  other  published  restrictions.  The  pilot  will  inform  the  loadmaster  of  any  gross  weight  restrictions  prior  to  mission planning so an accurate Allowable Cabin Load (ACL) may be obtained. 5.3.2.1.  Takeoff.  Unless other restrictions are imposed, use 164,000 pounds for takeoff. 5.3.2.2.  Landing.  Unless other landing restrictions such as maximum effort landings are imposed,  use  164,000  pounds.    Subtract  operating  weight  plus  estimated  landing  fuel (references  9  and  23).    Refer  to  the  TO  1C-130(M)J-1  and  TO 1C130(E)J-1  for  assault landing limitations. 5.3.2.3.  Limiting Wing  Fuel.   The CNI-MU is  the primary method to  compute limiting wing fuel.  The limiting wing fuel chart in TO 1C-130(M)J-1 or 1C-130(E)J-1, is based on a 2.5 G maneuver load factor with indicated airspeed restrictions outlined in area "C" of the flight manual limitation charts.  Specific mission requirements exceeding area "C" limitations  must  be  computed  using  the  appropriate  flight  manual  weight  limitation charts.   50  AFI11-2EC-MC-130JV3_ADDA-A  28 JULY 2015 5.3.3.  Permissible  CG  Takeoff  and  Landing.    Compute  the  forward  and  aft  CG  limitations using  the  CG  table  in  the  appropriate  TO  1C-130(M)J-5-2  or  1C130J52.    Leave  the  block entitled "Permissible CG Zero Fuel Wt" blank. 5.3.4.  Signature Blocks: 5.3.4.1.  Computed by:  Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate. 5.3.4.2.  Weight and Balance Authority:  Leave blank. 5.3.4.3.  Pilot:  Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate.  Note:  In the remarks section, enter a total takeoff fuel weight to the nearest 100 pounds and moments using the CNIMU.  Note:  During engine running onloads or when planned ground times require, a combined load Center of Balance (C/B) may be used if a validated load plan is presented, and the aircraft is loaded per the load plan. 5.3.5.  Compute and enter zero fuel weight and zero fuel moment by zeroing out the Takeoff and Landing Fuels on the fuel page.  Return to the main weight and balance page to calculate the Takeoff and Landing Zero Fuel Weight.  After calculations have been entered, return to the  fuel  page  and  return  the  fuel  to  its  original  state.    Zero  fuel  percent  of  MAC  is  not required, but may be helpful when targeting a 20-22 zero fuel percent of MAC. 5.3.5.1.  Reference  22.    If  required,  subtract  airdrop  load  weight  and  moment  from reference  21  or  changes  in  corrections  column  and  enter  as  adjusted  zero  fuel weight/moment  on  the  first  blank  line  in  reference  22.    First  blank  line  title  will  read, “ADJ ZFW/M”. 5.3.5.2.  Use the following criteria to compute fuel burn off when flight plan fuel weights are not available. 5.3.5.2.1.  4,000 Pounds Per Hour (PPH) - normal flight at altitude. 5.3.5.2.2.  5,000 PPH - first hour of flight (climb out) or low-level. 5.3.5.3.  Copy the information from the data entered in the CNI-MU Weight and Balance pages and handwrite, type, or computer generate a copy of the DD Form 365-4. Table 5.1.
