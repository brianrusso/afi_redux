PALACE Teams fund other training that USAF formal schools do not sponsor but formpart of the T&D plan.2.20.1.2. The organization in which the PAQ intern or fellow receives training may also fundtraining that the T&D plan doesn't require.2.20.1.3. For USAF formal schools, PALACE Teams prepare a RIP, Allocation of TrainingQuota (QUOTA1), which notifies the PAQ intern's or fellow's servicing CPF of the scheduledtraining and the appropriate fund citation.2.20.1.4. The PALACE Team provides the fund citation by message for AFCPMC-funded train-ing.2.20.2. Requirements. During the annual training survey, PALACE Teams:•Identify  requirements  in  the  Training  Management  System  (TMS)  by  using  the  TrainingRequest Quota Indicator (TRQI) at AFCPMC.• Request waivers as necessary.•Schedule AFCPMC-funded courses that the TMS does not cover, if the courses are part of theT&D plan.2.20.3. Quotas. As PALACE Teams receive quotas, they allocate them through the TMS by theName-Sub-Allocation process and provide information and fund citations by message to the servicingCPF training office when needed.2.20.3.1. The servicing CPF training office obtains and processes DD Form 1556, Request,Authorization, Agreement, Certification of Training and Reimbursement, when PALACETeams allocate the quotas.132.20.4. Extension Course Institute (ECI) and Correspondence Courses. The supervisor and ser-vicing CPF follow local procedures in obtaining these courses, which the PALACE Team funds.2.21. Managing Overtime.2.21.1. Supervisors approve on-site overtime only in unusual situations and after they have exhaustedother alternatives to complete the work.2.21.2. The supervisor requests agreement from the PALACE Team by telephone in advance for theovertime work.2.21.2.1. If the PALACE Team approves, the supervisor submits:• A request for overtime in accordance with local CPF procedures.• AF Form 896, Personnel Loaned or Borrowed by Cost Center, in order to charge theovertime to the appropriate local organization cost center.2.21.2.2. The CPF sends a copy of the approved request to the PALACE Team.2.21.3. AFCPMC does not fund on-site overtime.2.21.4. AFCPMC funds TDY overtime for PAQ interns who must travel during non-duty hours toattend training or if overtime is required for training while at the TDY location.2.21.4.1. The PAQ intern's supervisor submits a request for such overtime in advance on AFForm 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time, throughnormal servicing CPF channels for approval by the PALACE Team.2.21.4.2. The PALACE Team reports the actual overtime hours that interns have worked toAFCPMC/DPOR within 2 weeks following completion of the TDY.2.22. Setting Pay. PAQ interns and fellows entering the Federal service for the first time start in step 1 ofa grade level under the appropriate pay scale for that position.2.22.1. For current Federal employees or those with prior Federal service, CPFs determine the  payrate in accordance with local pay policy and highest-previous-rate rules.2.22.2. Pay retention applies if a selectee's current pay exceeds step 10 of a grade, and no break in ser-vice has occurred.2.23. Performance Management. The Air Force Performance Management Program covers PAQinterns and fellows.2.24. Managing the Probationary Period. The first year of employment serves as the probationaryperiod during which the supervisor closely monitors performance and conduct to determine if the PAQintern or fellow should continue in the program.2.24.1. If poor job performance, scholastic deficiency, poor training progress, or conduct and disci-pline problems appear, the supervisor immediately contacts the servicing CPF Employee-Manage-ment Relations (EMR) or Employee Development (ED) Specialist and the PALACE Team.2.24.2. The supervisor and the EMR or ED Specialist provide counseling to the intern or fellow.142.24.3. If the PAQ intern or fellow fails to respond to the counseling, the supervisor notifies the PAL-ACE Team before separating the PAQ intern or fellow from Air Force employment.2.25. Evaluating Performance.2.25.1. The initial supervisor of record serves as the rating official during the entire training program.EXCEPTION: PAQ interns or fellows who receive reassignments or promotions to another organiza-tion receive a new supervisor of record.2.25.2. The supervisor of record develops a performance plan using the position description and theT&D plan as a reference, and solicits input from the PAQ intern or fellow and other assignment super-visors who will participate during the rating period.2.25.3. After discussing the performance plan with the PAQ intern or fellow, the supervisor of recordprovides copies of the performance plan to the assignment supervisors.2.25.4. The supervisor of record conducts the initial 90-day and annual performance appraisals inaccordance with standard Air Force procedures based on personal observation and input from assign-ment supervisors instructors.2.25.4.1. The second-level supervisor serves as the reviewing official.2.25.5. The supervisor of record follows Air Force procedures when preparing a less than fully suc-cessful performance appraisal and advises the PALACE Team.2.26. Recognizing Successful Performance. Because PAQ interns and fellows receive recommenda-tions for promotion based partly on the quality of their performance, a performance rating of "excellent"or "superior" normally is considered to be adequate recognition.2.26.1. Monetary awards are not usually warranted.2.26.1.1. If a supervisor considers a monetary award to be appropriate, the local activity recom-mending the award:• Must provide the funds.• Get approval from local management and the PALACE Team.2.27. Placing PAQ Interns. Management  promotes or reassigns a PAQ intern to a permanent, locallyfunded position, normally within the same MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU in which the training occurred uponcompletion of training.2.27.1. Management may place interns up to 12 months before the scheduled training completiondate, if the intern meets all the training and regulatory requirements.2.27.1.1. Management must coordinate such actions in advance with the PALACE Team and, ifapplicable, with the gaining and losing CPFs and MAJCOMs, FOAs, or DRUs.2.27.2. The PALACE Team gives the PAQ intern the placement offer in writing when a PCS actionis involved.2.27.2.1. If the PAQ intern is within 90 days of completing training or  management has extendedthe training period until identifying a locally funded position, the placement offer letter must15inform the intern that declining the offer will result in separation from Air Force employment inaccordance with the mobility agreement signed when the offer of employment was accepted.2.27.2.2. When necessary, the PALACE Team notifies the CPF to begin separation action.Section 2D—Internal Reviews and Evaluations2.28. Purpose and Scope. AFCPMC/DPC and DPO conduct an annual review of the program to deter-mine program effectiveness through feedback from MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, CPFs, supervisors, PAL-ACE Teams, recruiters, PAQ interns and fellows, and AFCPMC/DPOR.16Chapter 3COPPER CAP3.1. General. The COPPER CAP program is an intern program designed to develop well-qualified,high-potential, and highly motivated individuals to occupy full performance level positions in the con-tracting career field.3.1.1.

AFPOA funds first-duty-station travel to high-cost areas, such as to Andrews AFB, MD;Hanscom AFB, MA; and Los Angeles AFB, CA.3.2.3. AFPOA funds management-initiated permanent changes of station (PCS).3.2.4. All COPPER CAP positions are assigned Functional Account Code (FAC) 1259.  Note: Themanpower authorization documents identify COPPER CAP positions as separate and distinct fromany other centrally funded positions. 3.3. Allocating Positions. The Policy Council Chair allocates positions to the MAJCOM functionalmanagers, who assure installations fill the positions with high-quality individuals.  MAJCOMs in turnallocate their positions to their installations.3.3.1. MAJCOM functional managers issue directives in enough detail to operate an effective pro-gram that provides appropriate training and final placement for each intern.3.4. Structure. COPPER CAP consists of basic and advanced phases, depending on the needs of theMAJCOMs.173.4.1. Basic Phase. The entry level for the basic phase begins at GS-05 or GS-07. The target graderanges from GS-09 to GS-12, as determined by the MAJCOM.  The minimum training period is nor-mally three years.  EXCEPTIONS: The minimum training period is two years if the entry level isGS-07 and the target position is GS-09.  The maximum training period is five years when the entrylevel is GS-05 and the target position is GS-12.3.4.2. Advanced Phase. Positions in the advanced phase concentrate on developing future managersor specialized skills.  Entry level for the advanced phase begins at the GS-09 or GS-11 level.  The tar-get grade may be either GS-11 or GS-12, depending upon the length of training (1 to 2 years).  Themaximum training period for a GS-12 is one year.3.4.2.1. Extension beyond the maximum training period requires Policy Council Chair approval.3.5. Recruiting Candidates. Potential candidates should be highly qualified, well-motivated personswho have demonstrated, through their academic background and/or their job experience, the aptitude andcapability to develop into successful civilian contracting leaders.3.5.1. The servicing Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF) classifies the Position Descriptions (PDs) foreach grade level .3.5.1.1. The selecting official submits a written request to the PALACE Team to fill a vacantCOPPER CAP position.  The selecting official  coordinates the request through the MAJCOM andformally advises whether the basic or advanced level is being requested.  The package to the PAL-ACE TEAM includes:• Copy of  the Intern Training Plan (ITP).••PDs for the applicable grade levels involved.SF 52, Request for Personnel Action, for each vacancy.3.5.2. Basic Phase. With approval of the PALACE Team, functional managers may fill basic phasepositions from either external or internal sources.3.5.2.1. External Recruitment. Selecting officials may use one of two external recruitmentoptions:  the Outstanding Scholar Program or the OPM Administrative Careers With America(ACWA) examination.3.5.2.1.1. Outstanding Scholar Program. Graduates and candidates for graduation from anaccredited college or university with a 3.45 or higher undergraduate grade point average (on a4.0 scale), or a ranking in the upper 10 percent of their college or major university subdivision;e.g., School of Business or School Of Arts and Sciences, are eligible under the provisions ofthe Outstanding Scholar program.3.5.2.1.1.1. The PALACE Team conducts on-campus recruiting under the provisions ofthe Outstanding Scholar program.  Alternately, the PALACE Team may authorize a select-ing official to conduct on-campus recruiting at a local educational institution under specialcircumstances.3.5.2.1.1.2. The PALACE Team refers eligible candidate(s) for placement.3.5.2.1.2. OPM Administrative Careers With America (ACWA) Examination. A f t e rapproval of the PALACE Team, the selecting official may request a certificate of eligible can-18didates directly from the Staffing Service Center Examining Office, Office of Personnel Man-agement, PO Box 9035, Macon GA 31297-6899.3.5.2.1.2.1. The selecting official notifies the PALACE Team of the selection made.  ThePALACE Team makes an offer to the candidate named by the selecting official.3.5.2.2. Internal Recruitment. The selecting official may hire qualified individuals using estab-lished local merit promotion procedures and a Promotion Evaluation Plan  (PEP) approved by thePALACE Team.3.5.2.2.1. In addition to the documents required in 3.5.1.1.paragraph 3.5.1.1. above, theselecting official submits a proposed Promotion Evaluation Pattern ( PEP) for approval by thePALACE Team.3.5.2.2.2. The selecting official notifies the PALACE  Team of the selection made prior tomaking an offer.3.5.3. Advanced Phase. The selecting official must obtain MAJCOM and Policy Council approvalto fill a COPPER CAP vacancy through the advanced phase intern program.3.5.3.1. All eligible, qualified, and interested Air Force employees may compete for advancedphase COPPER CAP positions.3.5.3.2. The PALACE Team issues an Air Force-wide announcement for a vacancy in response toa request for a certificate of  candidates for an advanced COPPER CAP position.3.5.3.3. The PALACE Team issues a certificate to the selecting official (SO) upon receivingapplications from interested candidates responding to the announcement.  The PALACE Teamprepares the certificate in accordance with an approved rating and ranking plan.3.5.3.4. The selecting official makes a selection and returns the certificate within 30 calendardays.  The selecting official makes the offer to the candidate in accordance with any selectionguidance procedures provided.3.6. Conditions of Employment. The intern executes a Conditions of Employment Agreement  at thetime an offer of employment is made, but no later than at the time of appointment. This  agreement is fur-nished by the PALACE Team.3.6.1. The servicing CPF ensures a copy of this agreement is provided to the PALACE Team afterexecution by all parties.3.6.2. Under the Conditions of Employment Agreement ( Attachment 1), the intern agrees to bemobile, to pursue the basic training objectives and activities in the ITP, and to obtain any requiredsecurity clearances.3.6.3. Interns who fail to relocate when necessary may  be separated from Air Force employment (seeparagraph 3.12.).3.7. Security. Unless an organization specifies otherwise, entry-level trainee positions are noncriticaland nonsensitive.3.7.1. The appropriate security clearance must be obtained if an intern requires access to classifiedinformation on a regular or recurring basis.193.7.2. Interns who fail to satisfy the requirements for a security clearance may be separated from AirForce employment (see paragraph 3.12.).3.8. Training. Because training is crucial to the development of COPPER CAP interns,  MAJCOMsmust carefully develop ITPs reflecting appropriate rotational on-the-job training (OJT) assignments.  Theintern, servicing CPF, organization COPPER CAP intern monitor (intern monitor), supervisor, and PAL-ACE Team receive copies of the ITP.  The CPF files a copy of the ITP in the intern’s Official PersonnelFile (OPF).  MAJCOMs keep copies of each ITP and review them periodically for currency.  MAJCOMsdistribute changes or new plans according to the same procedures.3.8.1. The PALACE Team reviews each ITP for conformity with the appropriate master developmentplan (MDP).  The intern monitor, supervisor, and intern use the ITP to identify formal trainingrequirements for the intern, to measure intern performance against the performance plan, and to serveas a guide to career development and progression.  The supervisor reviews the ITP with the intern atleast annually during the annual performance appraisal.3.8.2. The  intern monitor or supervisor identifies all formal schooling set forth in the ITP in theRequired Training Area (RTA) of the Career Enhancement Plan (CEP).  The supervisor consults theITP during the annual training survey to identify formal school requirements for the year.  The internmonitor reports any difficulties in obtaining necessary formal school quotas to the MAJCOM COP-PER CAP intern monitor.3.8.3. Supervisors will follow the rotational assignments and OJT requirements set forth in the ITP.Some flexibility in assignments based on mission requirements is acceptable; however, supervisorsmust immediately report significant deviations from the ITP to the MAJCOM  COPPER CAP internmonitor and to the PALACE Team.3.8.4. MAJCOMs track intern progress according to the ITP and ensure documentation of all com-pleted training on the ITP.3.9. Appraisals and Evaluations. COPPER CAP interns receive initial 90-day appraisals, quarterlyevaluations (semiannual after the first year), and annual appraisals.3.9.1. Initial 90-Day Appraisal. Using AF Form 860, Civilian Performance and PromotionAppraisal - Performance Plan, and input from the immediate supervisor, the supervisor of recordconducts an initial 90-day appraisal by completing AF Form 860A, Civilian Performance and Pro-motion Appraisal - Performance Rating.  The supervisor of record sends a copy of the intern’s AFForm 860A to AFCPMC/DPCQ.3.9.2. Annual Appraisals. Using AF Form 860 and input from rotational immediate supervisors, thesupervisor of record conducts an annual appraisal by completing AF Form 860A.  Note: Theappraisal period  is from 1 July through 30 June of each year. The supervisor of record sends a copyof the intern’s AF Form 860A to AFCPMC/DPCQ.3.9.3. Periodic Evaluations. The intern and the supervisor submit evaluations to AFCPMC/DPCQon a quarterly basis during the first year, and semiannually thereafter.3.9.3.1. Interns provide these periodic evaluations of their training program directly to AFCPMC/DPCQ.  The PALACE Team provides the format.203.9.3.2. Supervisors provide these periodic evaluations to the PALACE Team using aDCPDS-generated Report on Individual Personnel (RIP).  Supervisors evaluate intern perfor-mance and the adequacy of the ITP.  Supervisors may make changes to the ITP at this time.  ThePALACE Team, servicing CPF, and intern receive copies of the completed evaluation.3.10. Promotions. Promotions are based on meeting the time-in-grade requirement, satisfactory or betterperformance on the job, successful progress as prescribed in the ITP, and a recommendation by the super-visor of record.3.10.1. The servicing CPF submits a PD for the next higher grade level and career promotion (CAR-PRO) RIP to the supervisor of record at least 90 days before the intern is eligible for promotion.  Thesupervisor of record completes the CARPRO RIP and returns it to the servicing CPF.3.10.2. When the intern has met all promotion requirements, the supervisor of record sends a copy ofthe SF 50, Notification of Personnel Action, and a signed copy of the CARPRO RIP to AFCPMC/DPCQ.3.10.3. When the intern has not met all promotion requirements, the supervisor of record consultswith the servicing CPF Employee Management Relations (EMR) or Employee Development (ED)Specialist to take appropriate action.3.10.4. The supervisor notifies the PALACE Team when the intern has not met all promotion require-ments.  This notification must be given no later than 120 days before the promotion is scheduled.  Thesupervisor sends a copy of all supporting documentation to AFCPMC/DPCQ.  The supervisor submitsAF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief, entries, quarterly reports, and annual appraisals withthe documentation.3.10.5. If an opportunity period to improve performance was granted, and the intern fails to improveto at least the fully successful performance level, the supervisor of record will initiate action toremove the intern from the program (see paragraph 3.12.).3.11. Overtime. Supervisors approve on-site overtime only in unusual situations and after they haveexhausted all other alternatives to complete the work.  The policies and procedures regarding overtime asprescribed for the PAQ intern program in Chapter 2, paragraph 2.21. of this Instruction apply to theCOPPER CAP intern program.3.12. Counseling and Terminations. The supervisor of record will use the first year of employment inthe intern program to determine if the intern should continue in the program.  The supervisor closely mon-itors the intern’s progress in the training program and performance under the ITP and determines, beforethe end of the first year, if such progress and performance are satisfactory.3.12.1. If an intern is not performing to the required program and ITP standards or exhibits behaviorrequiring corrective action, the supervisor of record is responsible for counseling the intern.  Thesupervisor of record will involve the EMR or ED Specialist as required.3.12.2. The supervisor of record documents problems on AF Form 971.3.12.3. If the intern fails to respond to counseling, the supervisor of record notifies the PALACETeam before separating the intern from Air Force employment.213.12.3.1. The Air Force may separate an intern who fails to receive a required security clearance,who fails to perform satisfactorily under the ITP, who fails to progress through the training pro-gram satisfactorily, or who fails to relocate when necessary under the Mobility Agreement.3.13. Conversions to Permanent Positions. MAJCOMs place  interns onto permanent, locally-fundedpositions.  MAJCOMs identify a permanent, locally-funded position for interns within six months of theintern’s projected graduation date.  The MAJCOM COPPER CAP intern monitor first places those internsclosest to or past their projected graduation dates.3.13.1. MAJCOMs who anticipate placement problems notify the PALACE Team at least 120 daysbefore the projected graduation date, or as soon as they become aware of the problem.  MAJCOMsmay request a program extension for an intern not to exceed six months from the projected graduationdate.3.13.1.1. MAJCOMs must formally justify a request for extension of a training program.  If a per-manent, locally-funded position is not available at the training location, the Air Force may exer-cise the Mobility Agreement.3.13.2. MAJCOMs may request approval for early placement from AFCPMC/DPCQ if the intern hascompleted all training objectives (that is, all formal courses and OJT rotational assignments), hasreached the target grade, and is within six months of the projected graduation date.3.13.2.1. The supervisor of record prepares an SF 52 to assign the intern to a permanent,locally-funded position.  The supervisor provides AFCPMC/DPCQ with a copy of the SF 50assigning the intern to the permanent, locally-funded position.3.13.3. The PALACE Team issues AF 3518, USAF Civilian Intern Program Certificate of Com-pletion, to all interns who successfully complete training.  The PALACE Team issues the certificatesof completion to the MAJCOMs for presentation at an appropriate ceremony by the senior field func-tional official.22Chapter 4PALACE KNIGHT4.1. General. PALACE Knight (PKN) is an Air Force-wide, centrally-funded trainee program adminis-tered by the Air Force Civilian Personnel Management Center (AFCPMC), through the Scientists andEngineer Career Program (SECP), at Randolph AFB TX.  The  PKN staff includes a program administra-tor, who operates the program, and two personnel assistants for program support.4.2. Purpose. PKN aims to increase the doctoral level of scientist and engineering personnel throughoutthe Air Force, particularly in the laboratory environment.  The Air Force meets this objective by recruitingtop-quality technical talent and offering a combination of graduate education and work experience.4.2.1. Managing Positions. AFPOA/AFCPMC administers and manages PKN authorizations.  Thedistribution of authorizations may vary each year depending upon changes in mission, projected man-power increases or reductions, skill requirements, funding constraints, and other operational consider-ations.  Although PKN is an Air Force-wide program, laboratories with the greatest need for advanceddegrees receive priority.  MAJCOMs submit all requests to participate through the SECP (AFCPMC/DPCW), to the Air Force Chief Scientists and Technical Director Panel for review and approval.  Thepanel consists of chief scientists and technical directors from participating MAJCOMs.  The panelensures that distribution of spaces are fair across the Air Force.4.2.2. Funding. AFPOA funds PKN positions for salary and moving expenses, relative to training,for 7 years or until completion of the Ph.D., whichever comes first.  HQ Air Force Materiel Commandfunds academic costs (tuition, books, and fees) for all participants within the command.  SECP fundsacademic costs for participants from other MAJCOMs.4.2.3. Types of Positions. The Air Force sets up PKN positions in the scientific and engineeringcareer fields.  Positions are in the competitive service and the Air Force fills them at the GS-07 orGS-09 level with a target grade of GS-13.  Upon completing the Ph.D. and meeting time-in-graderequirements, participants may be promoted into a locally funded GS-13 target position.4.3. Program Definition.4.3.1. PKN entry level GS-07 allows bachelor of science graduates and current master of science can-didates to proceed directly to an Air Force-funded advanced studies program for a 12- to 18-monthperiod.  Advanced studies are continuous and not interrupted by a work period.  Students  pursuingadvanced studies must complete degree requirements within 18 months from the time of employment.After completing degree requirements, students relocate to the home base twelve to thirty months ofwork experience..  After this segment of training is completed, they return to the same university orone that the Air Force has determined is in its best interest for additional (Ph.D.) training.  Participantscomplete this phase of training within 3 years.4.3.1.1. PKN combined M.S. and Ph.D. entry level GS-07 allows  bachelor degree graduates tobegin the program by working at least one year in the home base before enrolling. After the workexperience, the participant proceeds to a university with an established four year M.S. and Ph.D.program.  Participants use this option mainly in the scientific fields in which colleges and univer-sities don’t normally grant a master’s degree.234.3.1.2. SENIOR Knight program entry level GS-9 allows individuals with completed master’sdegrees or Ph.D. studies in progress to be selected.  Selectees with a completed master’s degreebegin with work experience in the home base for at least one year.  After one year or more, partic-ipants proceed to a university to begin Ph.D. studies.  Participants may spend one to three years inadvanced studies, depending on the academic status of the participant at the time of employment.Selectees currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program may continue pursuing  studies.4.3.1.3. Regardless of past academic and work experience, selecting officials may not hire:••PKN selectees at any higher grade than a GS-07.SENIOR Knight selectees above the GS-09 level.4.4. Selecting Candidates.4.4.1. A team of  personnel from participating organizations and led by a SECP representativerecruits candidates primarily through college recruitment during the fall only.  Each year the PKNstaff targets a certain number of nonminority universities as well as an equal number of minority uni-versities for on-campus visits.  Air Force laboratories and organizations  conduct  independent recruit-ment at universities having unique academic disciplines or  those where Air Force research is beingaccomplished.  The PKN staff  sends applications to nonrecruited schools and makes them availablethrough the placement office and departments.4.4.2. Only US citizens able to obtain and maintain security clearances may be selected. Baccalaure-ate applicants must be within six months of graduation and have applied to or been accepted by anaccredited university for graduate studies.  Applicants with completed Master of Science degrees ormaster's or Ph.D. studies in progress may also apply.  The Air Force seeks at least a 3.25 Grade PointAverage (on a 4.0 scale) in undergraduate studies.  Candidates must take the Graduate Record Exam-ination (GRE).  The Air Force seeks at least a combined score (verbal and quantitative) of 1000.  Cur-rent Ph.D. candidates (not precandidates) who have not previously taken the GRE do not need to doso.4.4.3. Applicants must submit a completed SF 171, Application for Federal Employment, all col-lege transcripts (may be unofficial at the time of application), GRE results, and,  if applicable, DDForm 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.  Selecting officials contact fac-ulty members whom the applicant identifies on the SF 171 as references, regarding the Ph.D. potentialof the applicant.  PKN staff rates applicants as eligible or ineligible according to current OPM instruc-tions and procedures, and refers eligible applicants to the primary and secondary laboratory identifiedon the SF 171 for on-site interviewing.4.4.4. Selecting officials recommend applicants for selection according to evidence of ability, includ-ing:  academic records, GRE scores, faculty recommendations,  and academic specialty in the majorfield of study for an M.S. or Ph.D.  A panel of scientists and engineers review applications and recom-mend selection based on individual laboratory or organization needs.  The Chief Scientist of the AirForce grants final approval for selection.  The PKN staff notifies  applicants by letter of selection ornonselection.4.5. Employment.244.5.1. Participants enter the program as Air Force civilian employees and must comply with the rulesand regulations of civil service employment.  Each participant is assigned a mentor and a supervisorwithin their organization.4.5.2. Before entering duty, applicants read and sign an agreement as a condition of employment.This agreement states that the applicant:• Must complete training as outlined in a structured training and development plan.• Continue employment with the Air Force for three times the length of the total training period.• Be able to secure and maintain an appropriate security clearance.• Be geographically mobile.Participants also agree that the selection of the university or college for advanced studies and coursework takes place in coordination with their mentor or supervisor and is in the best interests of the AirForce.4.5.3. Employment in the program begins on the day before classes start at the university, or, if theparticipant is beginning the program with work experience, on the first day of work at an Air Forcebase.4.5.4. Participants do not receive promotion to the GS-13 level until after they have received thePh.D., satisfied regulatory  requirements, and the  supervisor, in coordination with the mentor, recom-mends the promotion.  The supervisor outlines performance and training requirements in a formaltraining and development plan.4.5.5. The Air Force pays for designated first-duty-station travel from the selectee's residence at thetime of selection to their first duty station or place of assignment (university).  The CPF servicing theorganization prepares travel orders  and advises the selectee of allowances for current and  futuretravel.4.6. Training.4.6.1. General. Participants follow a structured training plan that outlines work/study progressionand requirements.  Participants receive training from a major university.  The PKN staff documents alltraining and obligated time (payback for training) on DD Form 1556, Request, Authorization,Agreement, Certification of Training, and Reimbursement.4.6.2. Training and Development Plans. The supervisor of record works with the assigned mentorto prepare the training and development plan for the PKN participant.  The supervisor and mentordevelop training plans for each grade level and incorporate, if appropriate, both the academic periodand the work period.  The training plan outlines work or study progression and requirements andexpectations that the Air Force will use with performance plans, appraisals, and evaluations.  Mentorsor supervisors discuss training and development plans with participants before or at the time theyenter on duty.4.6.3. Selecting Schools for Advanced Studies. Part of the preselection process includes the univer-sity or college to which the applicant has applied or been accepted.  Applicants must have applied orbeen accepted to an accredited university, recognized in the field of the specialty they are pursuing,before applying for the PKN.   In turn, the applicant's specialty field must relate to the Air Force posi-tion being filled. In selecting an applicant, the selection board must approve the school to which the25applicant has applied or been accepted.  Failure to gain acceptance into the university designated onthe offer letter may result in termination from the program.  The selection board may select an appli-cant contingent on acceptance into a particular school.  The selection of the school must be in the bestinterests of the Air Force.  B.S. applicants planning to enroll in a continuous M.S. or Ph.D. programmust begin work before enrolling and thus delay advanced studies for one year.4.6.4. Education Plan. Participants must provide an education plan prior to enrolling in graduatestudies.  Each participant lists all courses for each semester or quarter from the beginning of enroll-ment to the completion of degree requirements based on available course information.  The educationplan also indicates a projected degree completion date.  The participant coordinates this date with thefaculty advisor and mentor.  The PKN staff uses the date to obligate funds for salaries and academiccosts.4.6.5. Course Load. Participants schedule a full course load for each academic  term.  For regularterms, 12 semester hours or the equivalent is considered a full load.  Studies will be continuous andnot interrupted with a work period until after the participant meets each degree requirement.  There-fore, participants must use the summer terms as fully as possible in order to keep their program lengthto a minimum.  For the summer terms, participants must carry at least 3 hours in a 5-week term, 6hours in an 8-week term, or 12 hours in a full summer session.  If the university does not providerequired courses during the summer term(s), the mentor  works with the faculty advisor to assignresearch or special projects during this time period.  If this is not possible, the mentor, together withappropriate management officials, may consider having the participant relocate to the home base dur-ing the summer to do research or gain work experience.  Participants follow the full course loadrequirement even though the university may require less.  Participants must receive approval for anydeviation to the above in advance.4.6.6. Research. Most advanced academic degree programs require research.  Where an optionexists, participants select the research option.  If research is selected, careful planning is essential.Participants must consider and coordinate with the assigned mentor the selection of an advisor and thecommittee, availability of data and research facilities, and other pertinent factors.  Participants supple-ment research when required courses do not fulfill the academic load requirement rather than registerfor nonrequired courses.  Participants may also use summer terms for research when required coursesare not available.  However, the total number of research credits scheduled should not exceed the min-imum number of credits that the institution requires for award of the degree.  Once participants havemet all course requirements, they do not need to register for a full load of formal research credits, aslong as the  total program is not lengthened and the research is full-time.  If the research is notfull-time, mentors may require the participant to take electives that have been determined to benefitthe program.  Participants must carefully check university policies  on continuous registration, num-ber of research "credits" required for the degree sought, availability of university facilities (library,computers, etc.) to students not formally registered, and coordinate with their mentors before choos-ing not to register for a term or registering for a reduced load.4.6.7. Selection of Courses. Participants schedule required and core courses as early as possible.Research credits may be used to fulfill the academic load requirement once course requirements arecompleted.  If participants enroll in a non-thesis program or cannot meet the full load requirement fora particular term, they may select designated electives within the academic major with advisor ormentor approval.  Participants do not schedule nonrequired courses just to satisfy the full load require-ment.  Participants follow their mentor’s guidance in planning their academic programs.264.6.8. Audit/Retake Courses. Participants may audit courses, or retake courses for which they havepreviously received credit with the approval of the mentor and upon the recommendation of the aca-demic advisor.  However, they must take such courses in addition to the minimum course load.  Par-ticipants pay for audits or courses they retake.4.6.9. Course Changes. When they anticipate a course change, participants contact their mentor forapproval.  Participants who drop, add, or change a course to audit without approval of their mentormay have to pay for the course.  The Air Force and the participant set up the obligation of paymentwhen they implement DD Form 1556 before enrollment.  By deviating from the initial planned courseof study without approval,  participants are obligating Government funds without authorization andrisk disciplinary action.4.6.10. Grade Reports. Participants submit grade reports to the PKN staff and their mentors at theend of each term.  For documentation purposes and calculation of the service commitment, partici-pants must submit a final transcript indicating award of a degree to the PKN staff  30 days  after theyhave met degree requirements.  Participants pay all costs related to grade reports and transcripts.4.6.11. Academic Recognition. Participants receiving recognition for outstanding academicachievement or election to membership in honorary fraternities or societies notify their mentors.  Ifthe recognition includes monetary award, the participant must request, by letter to the PKN staff,  per-mission to accept the compensation.  This request includes copies of documents that clearly describethe intent and value of the compensation and a statement from the participant indicating how the com-pensation will be used.  In no case may the participant accept and use compensation without approval.Participants are encouraged to partake in such activities when academic programs permit.4.6.12. Academic Difficulties. If participants encounter academic difficulty, they must consult withtheir advisor or professors, seek the aid of other students, or hire a private tutor (at the participant’sexpense).  Above all, participants must advise their mentor whose goal it is to ensure  they success-fully complete their programs and who will work with them to help alleviate difficult situations.4.6.13. Academic Probation. Supervisors and/or faculty  place participants on probation when theyfail to meet minimum academic standards as outlined in their training and development plan or uni-versity requirements.  This action represents a warning that failure to improve may result in removalfrom the PKN.4.6.14. Clearance of Articles and Speeches. Participants must get permission from their mentorsbefore releasing material for publication or oral presentation (books, magazine articles, technicalpapers, news releases, speeches, etc.).4.6.15. Patent Applications. The Air Force encourages inventive talent while aiming to protect therights of both the Government and the inventor.  Participants considering patent application consultwith their mentor or supervisor concerning their rights, responsibilities, and applicable procedures.4.6.16. Attendance at Conferences and Seminars. Employees on full-time training may take partin activities and meetings of nongovernmental associations, to include technical, scientific, and pro-fessional societies.  Funding and approval authorities differ depending on the purpose of the meeting.Supervisors may use government funds when the purpose for attendance clearly meets a trainingobjectives.  If travel at Government expense is not authorized and the employee agrees to travel at hisor her own expense, supervisors decide whether to carry the employee in a duty status (if attendanceis in the interest of the Air Force).  In that situation, supervisors issue permissive TDY orders.  Theseorders allow individuals to be away from their permanent duty station without being charged leave.  If27attendance is solely for the purpose of representing the university, the participant gets approval fromthe supervisor to attend.  If the supervisor approves, the university or the participant pays for allexpenses connected to the meeting.  For time and attendance purposes, supervisors record the partici-pant as being on annual leave or LWOP, as appropriate.4.6.17. Tuition and Required Fee Payment. Participants provide information relating to tuition andrequired fee costs to the PKN staff.  The university bursar’s office, upon authorization, bills the AirForce directly for these charges.  Required fees are fees that are applicable to all students pursuing thesame or a similar curriculum.  The Air Force does not pay fees such as waiverable health fees, parkingfees, charges for personal services (food, housing, laundry, utilities, and telephone), or school sup-plies.  Telephone calls to the home organization are not reimbursable; nor are collect calls permissible.Participants must get advance approval for fees that the university does not identify in the universitybulletin and does not bill through the bursar’s office, but which a department imposes, and are uniqueto that department or the university.  The Air Force doesn’t pay for thesis and dissertation fees orrelated costs for typing, binding, microfilming, using computers, etc.4.6.18. Textbook Allowances. The Air Force reimburses participants for required textbooks.  Partic-ipants submit SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business, whichincludes copies of all textbook receipts, signed by the vendor.4.6.19. Contributions. Participants in the PKN are not eligible to receive any contributions, awards,grants, fellowships, assistantships, or payments in connection with this training.4.6.20. Degree Completion Dates. In nonresearch master’s programs, the completion date is nor-mally the last day of final examinations of the term during which the student completes all degreerequirements.  In doctoral and thesis master’s programs, the completion date is normally the date thestudent submits the thesis or dissertation in final approved form.  Participants coordinate exceptionswith their mentors (such as in the case of a dissertation being completed away from school in compli-ance with university requirements and the participant’s training and development plan).  Participantsmust notify the PKN staff 60 days in advance of the completion date so that they may prepare the par-ticipant’s travel orders back to the home base.4.6.21. Academic Extensions. The Air Force uses the degree completion date on the participant’seducation plan to obligate funds for academic costs, salaries, and moving expenses.  The participant,mentor, and supervisor must ensure the participant can meet degree completion dates on or before thedesignated time frame.  The participant justifies in writing, requests for an extension beyond the dateon the education plan to the mentor and supervisor 90 days before the previous approved date.  If thementor and supervisor approve, they send the request through the laboratory chief scientist and com-mander to HQ AFMC/ST and HQ AF/ST for agreement.  Recent limitations on funding make itunlikely that any request for extension will be approved.  Therefore, failure to complete degreerequirements in the time designated by contract  may result in placing the individual in a leave withoutpay (LWOP) status until the individual meets the degree requirements.4.7.

Air Force Civilian Intern and Cooperative Fellowship Programs offer excellent education, training, promotions, and enhanced opportunities to pursue career goals after completion of required training.  Career opportunities, generally speaking, are much better than those extended to other employ-ees because Air Force trainee programs are designed to produce employees who will be future civilian Air Force leaders.  Therefore, the Air Force trainee programs require each selected individual to sign a mobil-ity agreement.a.  Management must be able to assign the best qualified civilian employees to meet critical manning needs for key managerial positions, or to provide employees with exposure to a variety of work experi-ences to complete their development for assumption of future senior level positions.  Therefore, during your career with the Air Force, you may be required to accept assignments to other positions at the same or higher grades, including assignment to different geographic locations.  Normally, these moves will be at government expense.b.  Consideration will be given to your geographic and assignment preferences upon completion of your training, but they cannot always be guaranteed.  Your agreement to relocate when necessary remains in effect until the effective date of placement in a position following completion of training.  Failure to relocate when necessary is cause for separation from Air Force employment.  During your training pro-gram, you may only receive consideration for other Air Force positions having a higher target grade than your current position.2.  You will be required to complete your training program and meet the objectives of your training plan, unless prevented for reasons beyond your control.  The training plan can be modified by appropriate Air Force management officials at any time to meet the needs of the Air Force.  Failure to make satisfactory progress in the training program is cause for removal from the program and may result in separation from Air Force employment.3.  Many trainee positions, and most management positions, require a security clearance.  If your position requires a security clearance and you are unable to be granted or maintain the appropriate clearance, you may be separated from Air Force employment.I UNDERSTAND THE PRECEDING REQUIREMENTS ON GEOGRAPHIC MOBILITY, TRAINING COMPLETION, AND SECURITY CLEARANCE, AND AGREE TO THEM AS CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT._____________________________________               _____________EMPLOYEE                                                                           DATECIVILIAN PERSONNEL REPRESENTATIVE                      DATE31
