The fact that another Service or the forces of another country have adopted the weapon or  cyber  capability  may  be  considered  in  determining  the  legality  of  such  weapon  or  cyber capability,  but  such  fact  shall  not  be  binding  for  purposes  of  any  legal  review  conducted under this Instruction. AFI51-402  27 July 2011 3.3.  Legal  issues  associated  with  employment  are  beyond  the  scope  of  a  weapon  or  cyber capability legal review.  As part of a targeting analysis, the unit or individual employing the weapon  or  the  cyber  capability  must  ensure  that  their  actions  comply  with  domestic  and international law, including LOAC.   4   RICHARD C.
