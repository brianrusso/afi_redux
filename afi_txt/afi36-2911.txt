When Unauthorized Absence (UA) Begins and Ends.  It is incumbent on the commander, first sergeant, and supervisor to investigate a member’s absence to determine whether or not the absence  is  voluntary  or  involuntary.    An  unauthorized  absence  begins  when  an  Airman voluntarily absences themselves from where they are ordered or otherwise required to be present.  An  unauthorized  absence  ends  when  the  absentee  or  deserter  returns  to  military  control.    An unauthorized absence of 24 hours or less is classified as “failure to go”.  Note: If the commander determines  the  member’s  absence  may  be  involuntary,  contact  the  force  support  squadron Casualty  Assistance  Representative  (CAR)  immediately  for  possible  Duty  Status  Whereabouts Unknown (DUSTWUN) reporting IAW AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services. 1.4.1.  When to classify as AWOL.  An unauthorized absence of more than 24 hours and less than  30  days  which  the  commander  has  determined  is  voluntary  is  classified  as  “absence without leave” or AWOL (UCMJ, Article 86).  Example:  Amn Doe is required to be at work at 0730 on Monday but fails to report.  Amn Doe’s supervisor, first sergeant, and commander investigate his absence and the commander determines the absence to be voluntary.  After 24 hours of unauthorized absence (0730 on Tuesday), the Commander will immediately report Amn Doe as AWOL with an effective date and time of Monday at 0730. 1.4.2.  When  to  classify  as  a  Deserter.    A  member  who  has  been  AWOL  for  more  than  30 consecutive days will be classified as a deserter (UCMJ, Article 85).  Example: Amn Doe has been  AWOL  since  1  Jan  2013.    He  remains  AWOL  through  2400  on  the  30th  consecutive day and his status is changed to Deserter on the 31st day (10th day during times of National Emergency or war declared by the President or Congress) with an effective date and time of 31  January  2013  at  0001.    Note:  An  absentee  does  not  have  to  be  placed  in  AWOL  status prior  to  being  classified  as  a  Deserter  status  if  the  member  is  absent  without  authority, regardless of the length of the absence, and meets any of the eligibility criteria listed below. AFI36-2911  14 OCTOBER 2016 9 1.4.2.1.  The commander has determined that the member remains absent from his or her unit, organization, or place of duty with no intention of returning. 1.4.2.2.  Is  under  the  duty  or  travel  restrictions  that  DoDM  5210.01-R/AFI  31-501, Personnel Security Program Management imposes. 1.4.2.3.  Has  had  access  in  the  past  12  months  to  Top  Secret  information  or  other classified information that requires special access authority (see paragraph 2.3.7).  Note:  Do  not  classify  a  person  who  appears  to  be  a  casualty  as  a  deserter  solely  because  the person has had access to classified material described herein. 1.4.2.4.  Has  gone  to,  or  stayed  in,  a  foreign  country  and,  while  there,  has  asked  for  or taken  any  type  of  asylum  or  resident  permit  from  that  country  or  its  governmental agencies. 1.4.2.5.  Has  action  pending  on  a  previous  unauthorized  absence  that  has  not  been completed. 1.4.2.6.  Is an escaped prisoner. 1.4.2.7.  Is  under  investigation  for  violating  the  UCMJ  as  listed  in  Attachment  2  or against whom charges for any offense have been referred to a General Court-Martial. 1.4.2.8.  Is believed likely to commit violent acts, or may harm themselves or the general public. 1.4.2.9.  AFPC/DPFC has determined member is a deserter. 10 AFI36-2911  14 OCTOBER 2016 Chapter 2 REPORTING UNAUTHORIZED ABSENCES 2.1.  Reporting  Responsibilities.  Unauthorized  absences  must  be  reported  immediately.  Supervisors  must  promptly  notify  the  chain  of  command  of  all  unauthorized  absences.    Unit commanders have the primary responsibility to determine the cause of absence and to find and return the individual to military control. 2.2.  Duty  Status  Reporting.  The CMS is  used to report all Duty Status Changes  requests for AWOL and Deserter as well as when the member is returned to military control (i.e., Present for Duty, confinement,  etc).  Specific processing  guidelines can be found in  the Personnel Service Delivery Guide – Duty Status Change Application Actions (AWOL, Deserter, and Confinement) on the AFPC myPers webpage. 2.2.1.  A new Duty Status Change request in CMS is required for each Duty Status Change (e.g., one CMS case to place the member in AWOL status; a second CMS case to return the member Present for Duty). 2.2.2.  In order to  expedite apprehension of absentees as well as ensure timely MilPDS  and DFAS  updates,  CSS/MPS  and  CCs  will  initiate  the  Duty  Status  Change  request  in  CMS within 1 duty day of the CC’s conclusion of the member’s voluntary absence.  (T-1) The date the CMS case is initiated is considered the date of the CC’s determination of status regardless of the effective date of the member’s AWOL/Deserter status date. 2.2.3.  Only  a  G-series  commander  may  sign/approve  the  Duty  Status  Change  request  in CMS.  If the member’s commander is unavailable to sign due to TDY, deployment, or leave, the  section  commander  (if  on  G-series  orders)  or  next  level  G-series  commander  may sign/approve in their place. 2.3.  Unit Commander Actions: 2.3.1.  Investigates  the  absence  looking  for  any  indication  that  the  absence  results  from  an involuntary  casualty  rather  than  desertion  or  unauthorized  absence.  (T-1)  The  member’s welfare is of highest concern.  In such situations, refer to AFI 36-3002 and consult the CAR to determine if DUSTWUN may be appropriate. (T-1) 2.3.1.1.  If the airman's absence is determined to  be voluntary and absence is more than 24  hours,  consult  the  JA  and  SFS  as  needed  and  immediately  notify  the  CSS  (if applicable) and MPS Force Management Office to initiate a Duty Status Change request in CMS for AWOL or Deserter.  (T-1) 2.3.1.2.  Upon receipt of the Duty Status Change Request, logs into CMS to approve the duty  status  change  and  refer  CMS  case  to  AWOL/Deserter  Program  Manager (AFPC/DPFCM). (T-1) 2.3.1.3.  Promptly  notifies  all  those  who  may  need  to  know  about  the  absence:  for example,  senior  leadership;  local  JA;  unit  and  MPS  Strength  Accounting  Duty  Status Program  Managers;  security  forces;  local  AFOSI  field  unit;  servicing  financial  services office (FSO); postal service center or unit mailroom of the absentee’s organization; and Base Exchange. AFI36-2911  14 OCTOBER 2016 11 2.3.1.4.  For  Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC)  inactive  members,  commanders  contact ANGSC/MPP (for ANGUS members), or HQ AFRC/A1K (for AFR members), and ask for  instructions.    For  ANG  record  types  AG/BG,  after  updating  the  duty  status,  no transaction  flows  from  MilPDS  to  Financial  Services  Office  to  update  the  member’s Master Military Pay Account (MMPA). 2.3.2.  Unit  Commander's  72-Hour  Status  Report  (Figure  2.1).    When  a  member  has  been absent for 72-hours, the commander reports information related to the member’s absence and status of investigation to local leadership and AFPC/DPFCM.  The unit commander ensures a copy of the letter is sent to AFPC/DPFCM and the installation’s chief of security forces.  (T-1) The 72-hours begins the first day of the member’s absence.  The report includes, but is not limited to: 2.3.2.1.  All  relevant  information  on  the  case;  for  example,  the  absentee's  duty  status when  the  unauthorized  absence  began,  the  leave  address  if  the  absentee  was  on  leave, and/or  the  gaining  unit  and  leave  address  for  delay  en  route  if  the  absentee  was  being reassigned. 2.3.2.2.  List of all actions taken to locate the absentee, including actions taken on leads.  If absentee reporting was delayed, provide an explanation of reason for delay.  Example: Amn Doe did not report to his duty station at 0730 on 1 Jan 14.  The commander was not made aware of his absence until 3 Jan 14 when the absentee was reported AWOL.  The 72-hour  report  states  that  the  absentee’s  supervisor  was  on  48  hour  quarters  and  didn’t become aware of Amn Doe’s absence until they returned to duty on 3 Jan 14. 2.3.2.3.  Whether  the  absentee  faces  pending  administrative  discharge  action  or  action under the UCMJ. 2.3.2.4.  All previous unauthorized absences and their disposition. 2.3.2.5.  A statement that AFI 36-3002 specifically in regard to Duty Status-Whereabouts Unknown (DUSTWUN), has been considered and is not applicable.  If in doubt, contact the MPS or AFPC/DPFCM for guidance. 2.3.2.6.  The facts, in detail, if the absentee is wanted for another offense(s). 2.3.2.7.  If  the  unit  commander  requests  FBI  assistance  in  finding  the  absentee,  the commander coordinates with the local AFOSI field unit and explains why FBI assistance is  requested.  Note:  AFOSI is  the only  AF  agency  to coordinate criminal  investigations with the FBI. 2.3.3.  Next-of-Kin Letter (Figures 2.2 through 2.5).  The unit commander writes a Next-of-Kin Letter (Figures 2.2 through 2.5) to family members and payees of allotments (e.g. former spouse receiving alimony or child support allotments) about the unauthorized absence. (T-1) The letters are sent to family members and other individuals who receive allotments living in foreign countries as well as US residents.  The unit commander sends a copy of the letter(s) to AFPC/DPFCM.  The member’s virtual Record of Emergency Data (vRED) may be used to identify next-of-kin.  Contact the FSO to determine payee of allotments. 2.3.3.1.  Send the letter(s) at the earliest of the following times: 2.3.3.1.1.  When evidence shows the absentee planned or spoke to others of a plan to leave without authorization. 12 AFI36-2911  14 OCTOBER 2016 2.3.3.1.2.

Apprehension  Procedures.  Commanders  start the  case  and  begin apprehension  efforts  as  soon  as  an  unauthorized  absence  occurs.  (T-0)  These  efforts  not  only assist return absentees to the military sooner, they also deter others from unauthorized absence. investigating 3.2.  Who Has Authority To Apprehend: 3.2.1.  Military  law  enforcement  personnel  and  commissioned,  warrant,  petty,  and  non-commissioned  officers  may  apprehend  absentees  and  deserters.    See  Article  7,  UCMJ,  and Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM) 302(b)(1) and 302(b)(2).   Commanders  should consult  the local JA and SFS concerning apprehension authority. 3.2.2.  Civil officers authorized to arrest offenders under federal and state laws may arrest a deserter and deliver the offender into the custody of the Armed Forces (see  Article 8 of the UCMJ and the RCM 302[b][3]).  These officers may also  arrest  absentees at  the request  of military or federal authorities. 3.2.3.  United States authorities may arrest absentees and deserters in foreign countries only: 3.2.3.1.  When an international agreement with the country authorizes it. 3.2.3.2.  Under  an  agreement  with  appropriate  local  authorities  that  does  not  violate  an existing international agreement. 3.2.3.3.  In  these  cases,  carefully  consider  and  consult  with  the  servicing  JA  about possible international implications and adverse foreign relations. 3.2.3.4.  If apprehension is impossible, or in any case of unclear apprehension authority, report  the  facts  to  HQ  USAF/JAO  at  DSN  225-9631  or  703-695-9631  to  expedite submission to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs for resolution. 3.3.  Notice of Air Force Deserters to Civil Authorities: 3.3.1.  Within  the  Jurisdiction  of  the  United  States.    The  unit  commander,  working  with security  forces  and  the  MPS,  if  needed,  promptly  sends  DD  Form  553  for  a  member administratively  classified  as  a  deserter  to  Armed  Forces  and  civilian  law  enforcement agencies most likely to help apprehend the absentee. 3.3.1.1.  AFPC/DPFCM sends notices to AFOSI ICON and to the Department of State in certain cases (i.e., those in which others know or strongly suspect the absentee has gone to a foreign country). 3.3.2.  Outside the Jurisdiction of the United States.  MAJCOMs act as needed respecting the primacy  of  international  agreements  to  secure  cooperation  in  apprehending  absentee  and/or deserted members.   AFI36-2911  14 OCTOBER 2016 27 3.4.  Investigations,  Apprehension,  and  Cooperation  with  Civilian  Law  Enforcement Authorities: 3.4.1.  Unit  commanders  work  closely  with  local  security  forces  and  AFOSI  field  units  to pursue  every  avenue  possible  to  locate  and  ensure  the  apprehension  of  absentees.    Leads developed  as  to  the  location  of  absentees  shall  be  conveyed  as  expeditiously  as  possible  to appropriate civilian law enforcement authorities who shall be asked to assist in the return of such persons to military control. 3.4.2.  In  cases  where  the  member  has  been  dropped  from  unit  rolls,  AFPC/DPFCM  and AFOSI ICON work together to resolve the case.  AFOSI ICON and local field units establish liaison and maintain a level of coordination with civilian law enforcement agencies necessary to encourage active participation in apprehension efforts.  AFPC/DPFCM provides any leads to  AFOSI ICON for further pursuit. (T-1) 3.4.3.  Absentees  detained  by  civilian  law  enforcement  authorities.    In  some  cases, AFPC/DPFCM  and/or  AFOSI  ICON  may  be  the  first  Air  Force  agencies  contacted  by civilian law enforcement authorities regarding the apprehension of an Air Force absentee. If AFPC/DPFCM  is  the  first  agency  contacted,  they  will  notify  AFOSI  ICON  (if  a  deserter) and: (T-1) 3.4.3.1.  Contact the nearest AF installation SFS within 1 duty day of the apprehension to expedite the absentee’s return to military control.  The SFS coordinates with civilian law enforcement  as  well  as  other  military  law  enforcement,  as  necessary,  to  expedite  the absentee’s return to the closest military installation with appropriate facilities. (T-1) 3.4.3.2.  For  member’s  absent  for  less  than  1  year,  AFPC/DPFCM  contacts  the  unit commander  within  1  duty  day  of  the  apprehension  in  order  to  coordinate  with  security forces to expedite the absentee’s return to military control. 3.4.4.  Civilian  law  enforcement  authorities  arrest  and  hold  absentees  to  assist  military departments.  The commander of the installation nearest where the absentee is being detained is responsible for taking custody of the absentee from civilian law enforcement authorities. 3.4.5.  Do  not  ask  civilian  law  enforcement  authorities  to  hold  absentees  longer  than necessary.    Make  every  attempt  to  pick  up  absentees  within  48  hours  after  civilian  law enforcement authorities agree to their release.  Consult with the JA if clarification is needed. 3.4.6.  If foreign authorities hold the absentee, consult with the JA before acting. 3.4.7.  When  a  Service  picks  up  absentees  from  civilian  law  enforcement  authorities anywhere  in  the  continental  United  States  (CONUS),  they  pick  up  all  such  individuals  at once, regardless of each member's military Service. 3.4.7.1.  Take absentees or deserters to the nearest military installation having facilities to process them. 3.4.7.2.  Inter-Service  agreements  will  be  used  to  facilitate  the  transfer  of  custody  of absentees and deserters of all Military Services. 3.4.8.  If the military Service cannot  pick up  all absentees or deserters held,  they  notify the other Services of the remaining individuals before leaving the confinement facility.  28 AFI36-2911  14 OCTOBER 2016 3.5.  Rewards and Reimbursements: 3.5.1.  Any  authorized  communication,  oral  or  written,  from  a  military  or  federal  law enforcement official or agency, requesting active cooperation in  apprehending or delivering to  military  control  an  absentee  or  deserter  wanted  by  a  military  department  constitutes  the basis for a reward.  After this communication, the Air Force rewards or reimburses (but not both) persons or agencies apprehending, detaining or delivering absentees, deserters, escaped military  prisoners,  or  parole  violators  to  military  control  under  an  Air  Force  Centrally Managed Allotment (CMA) Account.  If a non-Air Force military absentee/deserter/escapee is  brought  to  an  Air  Force  installation  and  a  reward  or  reimbursement  is  due,  the apprehendee’s parent military department Military Personnel Pay Account pays, not the Air Force CMA. 3.5.1.1.  Payment  of  a  reward  shall  not  exceed  that  named  in  10  USC  Section  956.  Contact  the  base  FSO  for  specific  guidance.    (Reference  AFI  65-601,  Volume  1, paragraph 12.7.5 and JTR Chapter 7). 3.5.2.  To request reward or reimbursement, persons or agencies must submit DD Form 553 to the FSO where the deserter is returned to Air Force control.  The remarks section of DD Form  553  must  include  the  name,  address  and  phone  number  for  the  persons  or  agencies requesting reward or reimbursement. (T-0) AFI36-2911  14 OCTOBER 2016 29 Chapter 4 ACTIONS TAKEN WHEN AN ABSENTEE RETURNS TO MILITARY CONTROL 4.1.  Notice  of  Return  to  Military  Control.  The  unit  CSS,  MPS,  or  commander  at  the  Air Force installation taking initial control of the absentee must notify AFPC/DPFCM immediately of the apprehension. (T-1) 4.1.1.  IAW AFI 31-205, AF Corrections System, paragraph 1.3.10.  Installation commanders maintain the capability to house pretrial detainees and adjudged inmates with sentences up to 1  year,  through  organic  confinement  facilities  (CF),  adjacent  DoD  facilities,  civilian contracts,  or  a  combination  of  organic,  Support  Agreement,  or  contract  derived  bed  space.  (T-1) 4.2.  Where Absentees Return to Military Control: 4.2.1.  At any military installation staffed by active duty personnel, immediately transfer an individual  to  the  nearest  installation  of  the  individual's  branch  of  military  Service  that  has facilities  to  process  absentees.    Military  authorities  will  take  absentees  and  deserters  being detained  temporarily  in  the  hands  of  civil  authorities  into  custody  within  48  hours  after receiving notification of the absentee’s or deserter’s place of detention. (T-1) 4.2.2.  In  foreign  countries,  military  attachés,  the  chief  of  the  Military  Assistance  Advisory Group  (MAAG),  or  similar  organizations,  may  not  help  an  absentee  who  asks  to  return  to military  control  unless  the  US  is  directly  responsible  for  the  individual's  presence  in  the country. 4.2.2.1.  Generally,  these  organizations  advise  such  absentees  to  report,  at  their  own expense, to a proper US military installation in the US or overseas. 4.2.2.2.  Unless absentees are citizens of the country in which US assistance is requested, they must be reported to the country’s proper authorities with a view toward deportation. 4.2.2.3.  If  the  individual  leaves  or  is  deported  from  the  foreign  country,  the  military attaché  or  chief  of  the  MAAG  arranges  for  the  individual's  custody  upon  arriving  in  a territory where US military officers have arresting authority. 4.2.3.  In  the  absence  of  other  specific  arrangements  among  military  Service  commands, when  one  of  the  military  Services  makes  a  pickup  of  absentees  and  deserters  from  civil authorities anywhere in the continental United States, all such individuals, regardless of their military  Service,  shall  be  picked  up  at  the  same  time  and  delivered  to  the  nearest  military installation  having  facilities  to  process  absentees  or  deserters.    When  such  a  multi-Service pickup  is  not  possible,  the  military  authority  making  a  limited  pickup  notifies  the  military Service(s)  of  the  individuals  remaining  in  civilian  custody,  preferably  before  leaving  the civilian confinement facility. 4.3.  Defining an Absentee’s Return to Military Control.  An absentee in the hands of civilian law  enforcement  authorities  is  no  longer  considered  to  be  at  large  when  Air  Force  authorities lodge  a  detainer  with  civil  authorities.    A  detainer  is  a  written  or  verbal  request  to  hold  the member for Air Force authorities when his or her presence is no longer required by civilian law 30 AFI36-2911  14 OCTOBER 2016 enforcement  authorities.    The  detainer  ensures  civilian  law  enforcement  authorities  inform military authorities when they are ready to release the absentee. 4.3.1.  An absentee’s return to military control occurs at the date and hour that: 4.3.1.1.  An  absentee  surrenders  to,  is  delivered  to,  or  is  apprehended  by  military authorities. 4.3.1.2.  A  civilian  law  enforcement  authority  informs  the  military  that  it  holds  the absentee for some reason other than the military's request. 4.3.1.3.  An absentee otherwise comes under the control of military personnel. 4.4.  Disposition of Absentee Returned to Military Control: 4.4.1.  Absentees  gone for less than 1  year are returned to  the unit they  were assigned to  at the time of their unauthorized absence. 4.4.2.  Members absent for 1 year or more are transferred to the nearest Air Force installation with facilities  to handle the case. 4.4.3.  For members in a PCS status, refer to table 4.1. 4.4.4.  In  some  cases,  the  rules  outlined  above  (paragraph  4.4.1  through  4.4.3)  may  not  be appropriate.    Under  these  circumstances,  contact  AFPC/DPFCM  for  further  guidance  and determination of unit of assignment. 4.4.5.  The  detaining  unit  contacts  AFPC/DPFCM  to  make  notification  of  the  return  of  a deserter to military control. 4.4.6.  For deserters requiring escort, do not release the deserter except to identified escort(s).  See paragraph 4.5 for escort delineation. 4.4.7.  For deserters who do not require escorts, the detaining security forces unit will issue a DD Form 460, Provisional Pass, and the member will travel to their duty station.(T-1) 4.4.8.  IAW  AFI  65-601,Volume  1,  paragraph  12.7.4,  the  Air  Force  may  furnish  military personnel who are in an absent-without-leave, desertion, or escaped-military-prisoner status (under  apprehension)  the  necessary  transportation  and  meal  tickets  to  return  to  their  duty station  or  as  determined  in  paragraph  4.4.1  through  4.4.4.  (T-1)  Contact  the  local  FSO  for specific guidance. 4.4.8.1.  The travel and expenses of the apprehended member are funded by the Military Personnel CMA account.  The base FSO provides the necessary CMA. 4.4.9.  The detaining unit  processes  a one-way TDY order or memorandum  for the deserter IAW AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders, table 2.1 and the Joint Travel Regulation.  In the Remarks section (Block 16), type the following statement:  “Member is a deserter returned to military control.” (T-1) 4.5.  Escorts.  The  action  unit  commander  coordinates  with  security  forces  to  determine  if absentees  need  escorts.    Use  security  forces  escorts  only  when  an  armed  escort  is  needed  as determined by the installation chief, Security Forces.  Prisoners not considered being a threat to themselves or the general public can be escorted by unarmed personnel such as supervisors and AFI36-2911  14 OCTOBER 2016 31 first sergeants.  The commander authorizes escorts for members detained outside their country of assignment only after consulting the servicing JA. 4.5.1.  Generally, use escorts if the member: 4.5.1.1.  Escaped from prison. 4.5.1.2.  Has been charged with other serious offenses. 4.5.1.3.  Was apprehended by civil authorities. 4.5.1.4.  Is a repeat offender. 4.5.1.5.  Has a history of disciplinary infractions. 4.5.2.  To ensure the absentee’s prompt return, on-duty escorts must not take leave or delay en-route. (T-1) 4.5.3.  Transportation and travel expenses for Air Force personnel acting as guards or escorts of Air Force or other Military Service absentees, deserters or escaped military prisoners are provided IAW AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 12.7 and 12.8.

MPS forwards the medical and dental records to local military treatment facility for filing. (T-1) 4.6.6.  Financial  Service  Office  will  coordinate  with  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting Service to have member’s Master Military Pay Account updated accordingly. 4.7.  Commander’s Determination.  The action unit commander: 4.7.1.  Takes responsibility for disposition of unauthorized absence. 4.7.2.  Reviews  case  circumstances  and  consults  with  JA  to  determine  if  the  absence  was avoidable or unavoidable. 4.7.3.  A commander who finds that an absence was: 4.7.3.1.  Avoidable,  consults  with  JA  and  takes  appropriate  disciplinary  action  as warranted. 4.7.3.2.  Unavoidable, excuses the absence.  The period of absence does not count as lost time to be made good.  Charge it to leave if not authorized for another reason (ref: AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program).  A new HR type PPA AWOL/Deserter CMS case is required to revoke the unauthorized absence report.  (T-3)  Examples of excused absences not charged to leave include, but are not limited to: 4.7.3.2.1.  When a member's lack of mental capacity causes the absence. 4.7.3.2.2.  When civilian law enforcement authorities hold, try and acquit a member. 4.7.4.
