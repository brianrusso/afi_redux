The ever-changing Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) environment requires vision, preparation, and attention to ensure people have the right skills and tools to deliver the capabilities and the support required by the war fighter in meeting the Air Force (AF) mission of today and vision of the future.  Declining resources, expanding mission diversity, and new technologies in the AF are impacting the readiness of our most valuable resource--people.  These factors will continue to exist in the future, making it essential for the workforce to be effectively and efficiently trained to perform duties within each skill level of an Air Force Specialty (AFS).  To meet the challenges of tomorrow, the AF must place a greater emphasis on career field training today.  2.  The BE CFETP is a comprehensive core training document that identifies life-cycle training and education requirements, support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the 4B0X1 specialty.  The plan is a "training road map" for the career field, providing personnel with a clear career path to success and makes career field training identifiable, measureable and budget defensible.  The CFETP provides personnel with a defined career path and instills rigor in all aspects of career field training.  It consists of two parts; supervisors use both parts to plan, manage, and control 4B0X1 training.  NOTE:  Civilians occupying BE positions may use Part II to support duty position qualification training. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall specialty management.   2.1.1.  Section A explains how everyone will use this plan.   2.1.2.  Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and defines the career field path.   2.1.3.  Section C associates each skill level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, experience).   2.1.4.  Section D identifies resource constraints and impacts.   2.1.5.  Section E identifies transitional training for Staff Sergeant (SSgt) through Master Sergeant (MSgt).   2.2.  Part  II provides a comprehensive list of training courses and standards available to support career field training requirements.  There are six sections to Part II:  Specialty Training Standard (STS), Course Objectives List (COL), On-The-Job (OJT) Support Material, Training Course Index and Civilian Certifications, MAJCOM-Unique Requirements, and Documentation of Training (Air Force Medical Service (AFMS)-specific section).  2.2.1.  Section A contains the most current version of the STS.  The revised STS identifies 3-, 5- and 7-skill level training requirements and indicates tasks determined as “core” tasks.  The STS also includes duties, tasks, technical references (TRs), the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM)-conducted training, wartime emergency “surge” training curriculum, and correspondence course requirements.   5 2.2.2.  Section B contains the COL.  Supervisors use this list to determine the scope of training Airmen receive from these courses.   2.2.3.  Section C identifies available OJT support materials, e.g. AF Qualification Training Packages (QTPs), which are developed to support proficiency training.   2.2.4.  Section D contains the training course index, list of mandatory courses, field training, and a variety of Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) courses used to support training within the 4B0X1 career field.  Supervisors use this index to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  2.2.5.  Section E identifies MAJCOM-Unique Requirements.   2.2.6.  Section F is specific to AFMS AFSs.  It describes the master training plan (MTP) and training documentation. 2.3.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overarching developmental goals specified in this CFETP.        3.  Use of the guidance provided in this CFETP provides the foundation for effective and efficient training of individuals in the 4B0X1 career field at the appropriate points in their career.   6 Part I, Section A – General Information 1.  CFETP Purpose.  The CFETP provides information necessary for the 4B0X1 AF Career Field Manager (AFCFM), 4B0X1 MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs), Commanders (CCs), Unit Training Managers (UTMs), supervisors, trainers and the USAFSAM Force Development Division (OED) to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field education and training program.  The plan outlines training for 4B0X1 Airmen and will assure development to progress and succeed in the career field.  The plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, proficiency, and continuation training.     1.1.  The USAFSAM provides 4B0X1-specific initial skills training upon an individual’s entry into the career field.  The USAFSAM awards the 3-skill level to BE Apprentice (BEA) course graduates. 1.2.  Upgrade training (UGT) identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, Career Development Course (CDC) completion, correspondence course completion, and minimum experience required to award the 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels.   1.3.  Qualification and/or job proficiency training (along with job experience) is hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training can occur both during and after the UGT process.  It provides the performance skills and knowledge training required to do the job.   1.4.  Advanced training is formal course training that provides individuals who are qualified in one or more positions of their specialty with additional skills and knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field.  Training is for selected career airmen at the advanced level of their AFS. 1.5.  Position qualification training is designed to qualify an Airman in a specific position.  This training occurs after UGT.  1.6.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or OJT, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.   1.7.  Continuation training is additional advanced training exceeding the minimum UGT requirements with emphasis on present or future duty assignments.  1.8.  The CFETP has several purposes, some of which are:  1.8.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, develop, manage, and conduct a career field training program.  Also, ensures that established training is provided at the appropriate point in an individual's career.  1.8.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends training throughout each phase of an individual's career.  1.8.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of the training, and provides the training medium.  1.8.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field training program.   7 2.  CFETP Use.  The CFETP is maintained and certified by the 4B0X1 AFCFM.  The USAFSAM/OED staff and MFMs review the plan annually to ensure currency and accuracy.  The 4B0X1 AFSC Training Manager at the USAFSAM/OED is delegated action officer authority to facilitate CFETP maintenance.  Career field training managers at all levels use the plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training program is available for each individual in the career ladder. 2.1.  The USAFSAM/OED staff develop and revise formal resident, nonresident, field, and exportable training based on requirements established during Utilization and Training Workshops (U&TWs) and documented in Part II of this CFETP.  They also develop procurement and acquisition strategies to obtain resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  4B0X1 MFMs in coordination with the MAJCOM SGPB ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial skill, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.   2.2.1.  4B0X1 MFMs in coordination with the MAJCOM SGPB also identify the needed AF Job Qualification Standards (AFJQSs)/AFQTPs to document unique UGT and continuation training requirements.  Requirements are satisfied through OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courseware/courses.  MFMs will identify MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFS for inclusion in this plan, and the training must not duplicate available training resources. 2.3.  The USAFSAM/OED develops the AFJQS and AFQTPs based on requests submitted by the MAJCOMs and according to the priorities assigned and approved by the 4B0X1 AFCFM. 2.4.  Unit-level enlisted specialty training (EST) managers and supervisors manage and control progression through the career field by ensuring individuals complete the mandatory training requirements for skill upgrade specified in this plan and MAJCOM supplemental training requirements.  The list of courses in Part II is used as a reference for planning continuation, supplemental, or career enhancement training. 2.5.  Individual 4B0X1 Airman will complete mandatory EST requirements specified in this plan to include respective UGT and continuation training plus associated third party certifications. 2.6.  Scope of Practice/Responsibility.  Total force BE enlisted personnel may be asked to perform tasks beyond their normal training and scope of practice and responsibility.  Scope of practice and responsibility is outlined in terms of this CFETP and is defined as the extent or range of subject knowledge, task knowledge, and task performance that BE personnel apply in the performance of duty at the appropriate skill level.     2.6.1.  When the Medical Group (MDG) leadership team validates requirements to utilize 4B0X1 Airmen to perform clinical or non-clinical tasks outside their scope of practice (i.e. another primary AFS’ mission space for which an AFS is organized, equipped and trained to execute), the organization must request approval for scope of practice/responsibility waiver.  Scope of practice/responsibility waivers, in this context, should not be confused with utilization of human capital for Unit/CC approved and validated short-term manpower support to efforts commonly referred to as ‘details’ or projects.  In accordance with (IAW) AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), “Commander and Supervisor shall:  Assign personnel to authorized positions consistent with requirements, Airman’s grade, and skill/qualification level.”  “The Military Personnel Section may authorize using airman through Senior Master Sergeant (SMSgt) outside their Control AFSC (CAFSC) up to 130 days in any 12 month period.”  However, to negate any career regression, the basis for an airman’s prolonged assignment outside of the normal career progression pattern must be limited and rotational.    8 Typically, details and projects should not exceed 130 days in duration unless member is part of official AEF or special authorized tasking (i.e. AEF center validated Third Country National duty tasking).  Procedures to request a scope of practice/responsibility waiver are outlined in AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations, and also highlighted in the following paragraphs 2.6.2. – 2.6.5.: 2.6.2.  The utilization of total force 4B0X1 technicians for extended scope of practice must meet three (3) criteria:  2.6.2.1.  The expanded scope of practice/responsibility of the task must be mission essential.  2.6.2.2.  The member must be trained and certified for the expanded scope by a competent and certified trainer and the training must be documented.  Training requirements must meet the standards established in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. 2.6.2.3.  The expanded role is restricted solely to military mission performance and it requires annual review and approval.   2.6.3.  The AFCFM is the final waiver authority for enlisted scope of practice/responsibility waivers.  Prior coordination is recommended as the matter may be avoided with proper chain of command notification of mission and resourcing needs and changes.  When requesting the scope of practice/responsibility waivers for 4B0X1, the enlisted waiver routing process is as follows: 2.6.3.1.  Scope of practice/responsibility waivers are required to authorize the use of 4B0X1 personnel in performance of 4N0X1-related tasks along with other medical (4X) AFSCs’ CFETP-listed tasks.  For example, in the case of waiver requests to perform 4N0X1-related tasks, route the scope of practice/responsibility waiver as follows:  BE Flight (BEF) CC, Squadron CC, Military Treatment Facility (MTF) 4B Functional Manager (FM) and 4N FM, SGP, SGN, SGH (SGN, SGH only required for waivers to perform 4N0X1 tasks), MTF CC, MAJCOM SGPB/SGP/SG, HAF SG3P (Attention:  4B0X1 AFCFM). 2.6.3.2.  Special authorization is required to use 4B0X1 personnel in performance of installation and unit specialized teams other than the BE Response Team.  Other specialized teams formed to support emergency response operations becomes a team member’s primary duty during response, exercises and training events.  BE team members should not be assigned conflicting emergency duties such as tasking and assigning 4B0X1 Airmen for resource augmentation duty (READY).  IAW AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations, “Emergency Responder duties have priority over other assigned duties.  Emergency Responders are not assigned as augmentees or to additional duties that will conflict with their emergency duties.”  As emergency responders, committing or double tasking BE Team Emergency Response members for READY, or any other augmentee role outside the scope of preventive medicine emergency response role puts the BE Response Team, MTF and its medical specialized teams at risk for degraded or mission failure under primary installation Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) incident and response force activities.  Unit CCs and supervisors of specialized emergency response team members must understand that when unit specialized teams are recalled, that team’s duties become the member’s primary duty.  Double tasking should be avoided, be approved by the chain of command, be noted in the Medical Readiness Council minutes, as well as elevated to the MAJCOM SGPB and SGP for situational awareness.  Unlike work details that are not tied to emergency, disaster or Medical Counter (MC)-CBRN response requirements (i.e. wing honor guard details), BE personnel must be capable of being recalled back to the primary mission space and to execute Primary AFSC (PAFSC) mission or expeditionary medical requirements as planned and programmed for during contingencies.     9 2.6.4.  Waiver requests will include the following:  2.6.4.1.  Rationale for expanding practice to include what human capital, location/host MTF. 2.6.4.2.  Specific task(s) to be added and the rationale for expanding practice.  2.6.4.3.  Task checklist/algorithm.  2.6.4.4.  Training plan, protocol(s), and references.  2.6.4.5.  Procedures for competency validation/certification/periodic certification.  2.6.4.6.  Plan for obtaining and sustaining competency for expanded practice. 2.6.5.  All waiver requests must be resubmitted annually for re-verification and approval. 2.6.6.  In all cases, training and periodic requirement, knowledge and skill certifications are formally certified on AF IMT 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS or AF IMT 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, and maintained in the individual’s electronic Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  Training references for all tasks beyond any individual’s scope of practice/responsibility or the CFETP will be maintained in the duty section where these tasks are performed.  2.6.7.  BE Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Status.  Total force BE are permanent AF medical non-combatant assets engaged in the identification, quantification and the control of CBRN/Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH) threats in support of Department of Defense (DoD) Force Health Protection & Readiness (FHP&R).  Therefore, 4B0X1 forces are governed by the "special rules governing the conduct of medical personnel on the battlefield" IAW Geneva Conventions and LOAC, whether in-garrison or in a deployed unit type code (UTC) status.  A scope of practice/responsibility waiver is not required for 4B0X1 support of MC-CBRN operations.  The 4B0X1s work closely with Joint Force combatant personnel and the Line of the AF (LAF) to collect, analyze, and communicate CBRN/OEH threat assessment (HTA)/health risk assessment (HRA) data.  Combatant Unit/CCs can and will use information developed in the HTA/HRA process to support overall threat assessment and risk management decision-making.  3.  CFETP Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority for any official change(s) made to the CFETP.  The 4B0X1 AFSC Training Manager officially initiates and coordinates the annual CFETP review and reports deficiencies to the AFCFM at least 45 days before the anniversary date of the CFETP IAW AFI 36-2201.  Annual CFETP review between the USAFSAM/OED and appointed MAJCOM representatives (typically appointed 4B0X1 MFMs in coordination with MAJCOM/SGPB) is accomplished to ensure currency and accuracy and to eliminate any duplicate training.  Deficiencies that may adversely impact the AFS or mission must be identified immediately using official memorandum of record coordinated with the MAJCOM SGPB.       10 Part I, Section B - Career Progression and Information 4.  Specialty Description.  BE performs, directs, and manages the technical aspects of military OEH risk management (OEH-RM).  The scope of work includes anticipating, recognizing, evaluating, and controlling exposure(s) to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats in addition to other physical hazards like directed energy (DE), thermal stress, and hazardous noise as well as human factors (HFs) such as ergonomic stressors.  The operating environment includes both garrison and deployed settings, at the tactical through strategic levels, across the full range of military operations.  Roles include, but are not limited to, nuclear enterprise (NE) support and incident response, installation and mission support, bare base bed-down and recurrent site assessment, anti-terrorism and force protection (AT/FP), humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), partnership building, and consequence management.  Deliverables include routine and emergency exposure sampling, analysis, and monitoring; qualitative and quantitative HRAs; health risk communication; and exposure informatics.  Exposure data for all media including air, water, soil, surface, and human-systems interfaces feed the DoD health surveillance system.  BE personnel lead the implementation of health-related federal mandates from the President of the United States, DoD, US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), operations orders, and status of forces agreements.  Accessions and force development center on required aptitude, behavior, knowledge and skills in physical and life Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM). 4.1.  Specialty Summary.

BE Vision.  Optimize combat capabilities by preventing casualties and enhancing performance in home station and deployed environments through full spectrum threat and hazard identification and health risk assessments.  4.5.  The BE Capabilities.  The BE career field provides CCs (home station and combatant) with expeditionary MC-CBRN capabilities, a critical part of the Aerospace Medicine Enterprise’s (AME’s) four (4) effects-based mission areas and the six (6) major Aerospace Medicine programs.  The AME effects-based mission areas are promote and sustain a healthy and fit force; prevent illness and injury; restore health; and optimize and sustain human performance.  The BEE mission-enabling capabilities and legacy of proven direct LAF and “operator” level support is one that the SECAF and CSAF recognize as the AFMS ‘trusted care, anywhere,’ and as critical to the AF “to fly, fight, and win” mission.   4.5.1.  The five (5) BE Capabilities are: 4.5.1.1.  Provide health surveillance:  Health surveillance capability promotes force generation through sampling, identification, quantification, assessment, risk communication, control, and documentation of potential exposures. 4.5.1.2.

Skill/Career Progression.  Adequate training is essential to timely progression of personnel from apprentice to the superintendent skill levels and training also plays an important role in the AF’s ability to accomplish its mission.  Everyone involved in training must do their part to plan, manage, and conduct effective training programs.  Following the guidance provided in this part of the CFETP and the BE Career Path table will ensure individuals receive required training at appropriate points in their careers.   13 Airmen should also review career progression information tailored to their grade and AFSC in the “Career Path Tool” accessible through the AF Portal and later discussed in paragraph 9.1.  NOTE:  Additional mandatory requirements for UGT to each skill level are covered in Part I, Section C of this CFETP.  5.1.  Apprentice/3-Skill Level.  Initial skills training in the 4B0X1 AFS consists of the tasks and knowledge training provided at the USAFSAM’s BEA in-residence course.  Individuals must successfully complete career field basic principles and fundamentals through technical training and task demonstrations, and also be recommended for advancement to the apprentice level by the BEA course supervisor.  The decision to train specific tasks and knowledge items in the BEA course is based on a review of the Occupational Analysis Report (OAR), training requirements analysis (TRA) data, and input from 4B0X1 subject matter experts (SMEs).  The STS, Section A Part II of the CFETP, identifies these task and knowledge training requirements.  5.1.1.  Individual Studies.  Apprentices should begin and strive to complete requirements for the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Associate of Applied Science (AAS) BE Technology degree.  Authorization must be granted by the members’ supervisor to enroll in off-duty college education, which must not interfere or delay progress in adapting to the USAF military requirements and achieving occupational proficiency.  For more information regarding the CCAF degree program, reference Part I, Section B – Career Progression and Information. 5.2.  Journeyman/5-Skill Level.  Upgrade training to the 5-skill level in this specialty starts immediately after assignment to the duty position as an apprentice/3-skill level.   5.2.1.  Upgrade Requirements.  Specific knowledge, education, training, experience, other requirements along with, training resources plus implementation of journeyman training requirements are found in the correlating specialty qualification tables found in Part I, Section C – Skill Level Training Requirements.  In this specialty, UGT to the 5-skill level consists of successfully completing the following requirements:   5.2.1.1  OJT.  A minimum of 12 months of OJT (9 months for those in retraining status) is required.  Five (5) skill level UGT periods over 24 month’s duration is considered excessive (36 months for Air National Guard (ANG) only).  (AFI 36-2201, paragraph 6.3.1.9.7.)   5.2.1.2.  Task Qualification.  All core tasks, specified by a five (5) in column two (2) of the STS, and assigned duty position must be complete.   5.2.1.3.  AFJQS/AFQTP.

Upgrade training to the 7-skill level starts on the first day of the promotion cycle once selected for promotion to the rank of SSgt.  In the case of SSgt retrainees, UGT starts upon award of the 5-skill level.   5.3.1.  UGT Requirements:  Specific knowledge, education, training, experience, other requirements along with training sources and resources plus implementation of journeyman training requirements are found in the correlating specialty qualification tables found Part I, Section C – Skill Level Training Requirements.  In this specialty, UGT to the 7-skill level consists of successfully completing the following requirements:    5.3.1.1.  OJT:  A minimum of 12 months of OJT (6 months for those in retraining status) is required.  Seven (7) skill level UGT periods over 24 months in duration is considered excessive (36 months for ANG only).  (AFI 36-2201, paragraph 6.5.2.1.7.) 5.3.1.2.  Task Qualification:  All core tasks as specified by a seven (7) in column two (2) of the STS, and assigned duty tasks must be complete. 15 5.3.1.3.  AFJQS/AFQTP.   Successful qualification in all critical task and/or equipment at assigned location by duty positions is required.  Third party task certifications are required for all core tasks using AFQTPs.  Once task certified, performance of that task may be accomplished without supervision.   5.3.1.4.  Advanced Training.  Upon completion of requirements in paragraphs 5.3.1 – 5.3.1.3., journeyman seeking 7-skill level upgrade qualification are required to attend the USAFSAM BE Occupational Health Measurements (OHM) course.  Completion of this course is mandatory for upgrade to the 7-skill level.  (Not waiverable) 5.3.1.5.  Approval Authority:  Must be recommended by the supervisor and formally approved by the commander for skill level upgrade.  The UTM assists the supervisor and CCs in this process as specified in AFI 36-2201. 5.3.2.  Proficiency Training:  Once upgraded to the 7-skill level, a craftsman maintains  competency by completing all continuation and proficiency training required or specified by command and/or local policies.  AF proficiency training and certification requirements for 4B0X1s are detailed in paragraph 7.5, and the periodic task training and certification requirements are identified in six (6) separate AF IMT 1098s.  The AF IMT 1098s are located on the BE Functional Area of the AF Portal at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/browse.do?programId=t330D98A14855F40F01486B121BA40660&channelPageId=s2D8EB9D6408E0AD001414B3FCEDF1549.  A 4B071 is expected to fulfill various supervisory, management, and leadership positions such as NCOIC of an element, flight, or larger functional program area with many interrelated and interdependent multi-faceted task challenges.  Craftsman must develop a strong understanding of “why” duties and tasks are executed to expand the knowledge and occupational leadership competencies needed to advance technical skills to highest levels while immersing and garnering the knowledge of the organization’s business practices and rules needed to manage change and operational health risk management priorities while concurrently developing others’ skills. 5.3.2.1.  Developmental and Continuing Education.  Completion of relevant USAFSAM BE advanced training courses is highly recommended upon assignment as an element leader or a large functional area program manager.  BE Craftsman may also increase their breadth and depth of technical skills, management, and leadership experience in the full-spectrum of BE duties and operational program areas by serving in additional duty institutional roles and deploying.  These opportunities assist BE Craftsman to expand their exposure to the AFMS organizational business practices and gain an understanding of the business aspects of the military health system which is required for career development and succession as an AF medic.  The BE Advanced Workshop (BEAW) is also an important part of development.  This workshop offers attendees the most up-to-date and relevant work requirements applicable to current and future BE business and operating business practices.  Prior to promotion to Master Sergeant (MSgt), craftsmen will be selected to attend the USAF NCO Academy (NCOA) or may have the opportunity to attend a Sister Service Academy; see AFI 36-2301 for specific EPME requirements and timelines.  As an expected career progression milestone and to strengthen BE occupational competencies, craftsmen should strive to complete the AAS in BE Technology degree.  Furthering education which leads to the award of a 4B0X1-relevant bachelor’s degree is highly encouraged upon CCAF degree graduation.  For more information on relevant BE bachelor degree programs, refer to paragraph 8.4.     16 5.3.3.  DSD.  SSgt, Technical Sergeants (TSgts), and MSgts who achieve the craftsman /7-skill level are eligible for DSD vectoring (as indicated by specified pay grade):  USAFSAM Technical Training Instructor (E5-E8), Career Assistance Advisor (CAA) (E7-E8), Military Training Instructor (MTI) (E6-E7), Military Training Leader (MTL) (E5-E8), USAFA Military Training (AMT) (E6-E7), Airman & Family Readiness Center (A&FRC) NCO (E6-E8), First Sergeant (entry as E7), USAF Honor Guard, Recruiter (NCO positions only), Recruiter (E5-E7) and EPME Instructor (E5-E8).   5.3.3.1.  With the exception of the USAFSAM Technical Training Instructor (T4B0X1), which is both an occupational and institutional career broadening opportunity, DSDs identified with a special duty identifier (SDI) (i.e. CAA, MTI, MTL, A&FRC NCO, First Sergeant, USAF Honor Guard, Recruiter, and EPME instructor) are considered institutional career-broadening and experience opportunities.  With the exception of the enlisted serving as T4B0X1 Instructor, enlisted members are expected to return to the original CAFSC after serving 3 or 4 years in a DSD with SDI.  Waivers to extend past the normal tour length in SDI are made by exception and based on the needs of the AF and best interest of the Airman’s developmental needs.   5.3.3.2. Special Duty Assignments (Cross-Flow).  First-term and career 4B0X1 Airmen possessing the listed qualifications in the AFPC Assignment Management System (AMS) (URL:  https://afas.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AMSNET/default.aspx) listed Equal Plus job advertisement may apply for advertised special duty positions, and further align personal and professional goals with the needs of the AF.  Special duty assignments may be core AFSC-validated special duty positions or validated special duty positions open to cross-flow AFSCs (such as certain liaison or embassy duty positions, dormitory leader duty that may require duty AFSC change to a temporary but new SDI).  Approval is based on manpower levels for applicants’ rank, or projected rank, and the overall health of the career field.  Airman’s skill level award must correlate with rank requirements at the time of application.   5.3.3.3.  KDPs – CAFSC Specific (TSgt-MSgt).

Duty titles for personnel working in this specialty are governed by AFI 36-2618, Enlisted Force Structure, and based on rank, skill level, and actual duty position as specified on the Unit Manning Document (UMD).  Enlisted personnel will have a duty title that most accurately reflects their day-to-day duties (i.e. Ground Safety Technician, CAA, and Dedicated Crew Chief).  When published, duty titles specified in functional directives will be utilized.  6.1.  Authorized Duty Titles.  Authorized duty titles shall not be confused with additional duties such as ‘program monitor’ or ‘program manager.’  Appointed additional duties and responsibilities are subordinate to the day-to-day duties and BE operational execution requirements for which the position is authorized, funded, and filled.  Those additional duty appointments are expected to follow a standard developmental building block approach detailed in this CFETP.  BE personnel must focus their attention on achieving competence demonstrated through performance throughout the continuum of learning (CoL) (i.e. education, training, and experience); focus on this CFETP expressed minimum CoL requirements rather than focusing on the duty title.  As such, and when properly utilized/applied, the following duty titles provide clear understanding of the institutional and occupational experience needed for career progression and succession counseling, mentoring, developmental education, and duty vectoring for future duty assignments by all parties concerned (individual, supervisor, CCs).  Additional transparency is gained because the entire 4B0X1 career field is aligned to a common operating practice that meets the people and mission resourcing needs and prepares more than one qualified and eligible candidate for developmental opportunities.  6.1.1.  Personnel in the 4B0X1 AFS are restricted to one (1) duty title; instances where personnel hold two (2) significant duties (i.e. NCOIC, CBRN Readiness/Response and Environmental Health, etc.), the duty title reflected should be the ‘primary’ position (i.e. where more than 50% of the member’s time is spent performing).  (AFI 36-2618, paragraph 7.2)   6.1.2.  The authorized enlisted duty titles for 4B0X1s performing specific functional requirements and their explanations are as follows: 6.1.2.1.  Bioenvironmental Engineering Apprentice:  Instances where a 4B031 trainee is attending the in residence USAFSAM BEA Course and/or when primarily serving in initial unit of assignment positions to fulfill upgrade upon arrival to their first duty station.   6.1.2.2.  Bioenvironmental Engineering Journeyman:  Instances where a 4B051 operates in PAFSC authorized positions usually located in the tactical operational level of a flight or an element or team within the flight.   6.1.2.3.  Bioenvironmental Engineering Craftsman:  Instances where a 4B071 operates in their PAFSC and the authorized position is located in the tactical operational level of a flight or an element or team within the flight.   6.1.3.  NCOIC:  Use of the NCOIC title must be strictly limited.  The NCOIC title is reserved exclusively for NCOs.  In the BE career field, the authorized NCOIC duties titles are determined by the individual’s designated duty position of responsibility and are as follows.  NOTE:  The Assistant NCOIC title is not authorized for use. 6.1.3.1.  NCOIC, Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight.  Instances where a NCO is responsible for managing the BEF (with more than >1 staff personnel assigned) the title, NCOIC, Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight, is appropriate. 21 6.1.3.2.  NCOIC, [Element].  Instances where more than one personnel is assigned to an element, the title “NCOIC, XXXX Element” is appropriate.  Primarily, career field opportunities to serve as NCOIC of an element exists at the large BE tactical operations units.  The element leader positions institutionalized in BE tactical/operational/strategic levels expand breadth and depth of occupational experience leveraging resources and teams effecting OH/IH, EH, Radiation/Nuclear Health and Safety, and MC-CBRN operational mission space.  Typically, the NCOIC, [Element] is responsible for related programs/tasks being executed by others and for enlisted staff development in the area of oversight.  Spending the right amount of time, at the right time, for the right Airmen is critical when building BE enlisted leaders equipped to deal with the myriad of challenges in the BE occupation and AF at all levels.  BE enlisted leaders should expand their competencies in targeted BE operational areas.  Not all BE enlisted members’ career assignments permit NCOIC, [Element] as primary position duty titles; however, that should not stop any enlisted member from being a leader at their rank and expanding competencies in the aforementioned BE mission spaces and in practicing/demonstrating the institutional competencies valued in the AF.  These duty positions and respective titles are not intended to add another layer of back office supervisors.  Rather, the positions align with efficient mainstream operational execution requirements, responsibilities, and duties executed in a manner that support the proper building block approach to staff development while getting the mission done.  Experiencing the right amount of time leveraging resources and demonstrating leadership capabilities leading teams and executing mission requirements is required.  The following functional areas duty positions and titles are authorized.  6.1.3.2.1.  NCOIC, Occupational Health(OH)/Industrial Hygiene (IH) Operations Element.  Instances where the NCO is responsible for overseeing, supervising and executing OEH routine and non-routine special IH surveillance programs (i.e. the OH programs with interoperating IH  surveillance program management and execution requirements).  OH/IH program activities and tasks are central to OEH exposure informatics and foundational to development of BE enlisted OH/IH competencies.  The element NCOIC is typically the next in rank order to serve as the BEF Chief. 6.1.3.2.2.  NCOIC, Readiness Plans and Operations Element.  Instances where the NCO typically oversees CBRN Readiness and Response Operations and associated emergency management plans and programs requirements.  Readiness Plans and Operational requirements generally include the logistics readiness functions associated with in-garrison and UTC organizational, equipment/supply reconstitution and training requirements plus lessons learned  (i.e. Quantitative Fit-Testing Program  (QNFT), vehicle operations, land mobile radio and network control). 6.1.3.2.3.  NCOIC, Radiation and Nuclear Health/Safety Operations Element.  Instances where the NCO is responsible for supervising and executing routine and non-routine radiation and nuclear health and safety programs.  Radiation and Nuclear Health requirements, activities, and tasks central to OEH exposure informatics and foundational to development of BE enlisted competencies in radiological plus nuclear health and safety programs (i.e. associated with  medical/dental x-ray, non-destructive inspections, large vehicle inspections, DE/LASERs, electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation, INRAD, nuclear/radioactive material shipments, and occupational worker/fetal protection dose monitoring and investigations/reporting and ILERs).  Additionally, this member typically oversees the radiological and nuclear aspects of the installation as the appointed installation radiation safety officer (IRSO) (primary or alternate).      22 6.1.3.2.4.  NCOIC, Environmental Health Operations Element.  Instances where the NCO is responsible for supervising and executing routine and non-routine environmental health (EH) programs.  EH activities and tasks central to OEH exposure informatics and foundational to development BE enlisted competencies in the subject of EH programs are drinking water quality, field water sanitation, water vulnerability assessments, and emergency response plans and programs associated with installation drinking water supply.   6.1.4.  Flight Chief, Bioenvironmental Engineering.  An instance where a SNCO is responsible for managing the BEF, the title, Flight Chief, Bioenvironmental Engineering, is appropriate. 6.1.5.  Superintendent, Bioenvironmental Engineering.  The title Superintendent is strictly limited for us by SMSgts/4B091s.  Typically, Superintendent/4B091s serve at the larger operational flights/MTFs and/or at the AF Materiel Command (AFMC) Air Logistics Centers.  Superintendent/4B091s are expected to fill the role of Unit CC appointed 4B0X1 FM for the MTF.  Exception:  MSgts who fill a 4B091 position based on the UMD may use the title Superintendent.  MSgts and below filling validated MSgt and below positions will NOT use the title Superintendent. 6.1.5.3.  Squadron Superintendent, [FILL IN] Aerospace Medicine Squadron.  Used by SNCOs who are the SEL of a squadron (i.e. Squadron Superintendent, 18th Aerospace Medicine Squadron).  Only SNCOs will hold the duty title of Squadron Superintendent. 6.1.6.  Manager, [FILL IN] Bioenvironmental Engineering.  SNCOs appointed as functional area managers may use the title Manager, [FILL IN] Bioenvironmental Engineering.  Manager positions are considered KDPs in the BE Functional Advisory Council for eDTs and limited to the following UMD authorizations. 6.1.7.  Chief Master Sergeants (CMSgts):  There are seven (7) 4B000 CMSgt positions authorized as of FY 2014:  (1) HQ AFMSA (DHHQ), Falls Church VA; (2) USAFSAM/OE, WPAFB, OH; (3) 673 AMDS, JB Elmendorf-Rich, AK; (4) 633 AMDS, JB Langley-Eustis, VA; (5) 87 AMDS, JB McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, NJ; (6) 60 AMDS, Travis AFB, CA; and (7) 559 MDOS, JB San Antonio-Lackland, TX.   6.1.7.1.  Manager, Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight.  CMSgt 4B000s may use the title, Manager, [FILL IN] Flight.  A SMSgt/4B000 assigned to a CMSgt billet may also use this Manager title.  Although authorized, this duty title is rarely used.  Currently, all 4B0 CEMs positions are strategic enlisted leader positions that are at least dual-hatted positions requiring >50% utilization leading broader and larger sized organizations in addition to the flight.   6.1.7.2.  Squadron Superintendent.  Used for CMSgts and occasionally a SMSgt or MSgt, who is the SEL of a squadron. 7.  Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach to develop the force in the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 4B0X1 career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  Initial skills and UGT requirements were reviewed, updated, and expanded during the 4B0X1 U&TW held 30 January – 3 February 2012 at USAFSAM.  The decision to train specific tasks and knowledge items in the initial skills course is based on 2010 occupational survey report (OSR) data, TRA data, and input from 4B0X1 SMEs.  Task and knowledge training requirements are identified in the STS (Part II, Section A of this CFETP).  The following training decisions were made during the U&TW: 23 7.1.  The STS was reviewed and updated to include:  multiple line items were added, and multiple items were assigned higher proficiency codes to eliminate skill gaps identified during site visits, gap analyses, and U&TW SME feedback.   7.2.  Initial (3-level) Skills Training.  The U&TW team changed tasks and proficiency codes in the 3-level course column to reflect the career field’s desire to increase the amount of hands-on training received by the students.  The U&TW added, deleted and modified course line items using OSR as the guiding criteria.   7.3.  5-skill level UGT Requirements.  The U&TW team revised the 5-skill level OJT and CDC columns to align and increase proficiency in the subjects and tasks introduced in initial skills training.  Third party certifications remain required for all core 5-skill level tasks. 7.4.  7-skill level UGT requirements:  The U&TW revised the 7-skill level OJT and CDC columns to align and increase proficiency in the subjects and tasks introduced in initial skills training.  Third party certifications remain required for all core 7-skill level tasks. 7.4.1.  The U&TW team added multiple tasks and increased multiple proficiency codes in the 7-skill level OJT column. 7.4.2.  Advanced Training Courses:  The U&TW resulted in major rewrites in advance training course along with validating two advanced training course needs as requirements.  Requirements met the AFMS’ Force Development Panel resulting in approval to rewrite and build utilizing resources currently programmed for within the BE portfolio at USAFSAM.  This drove shifting in-residence knowledge requirements to other respective supplemental training venues (i.e. CDCs and OJT, proficiency training and DL).  Access the Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) website through the AF Portal at https://www.my.af.mil/etcacourses/ for course catalog, availability, eligibility requirements, and schedules.   7.4.2.1.  Occupational Health Measurements (OHM):  The BE Site Assessment (BESA) Part I (ADL) and Part II (in-resident) courses were replaced by the OHM course.  The OHM course provides critical advanced occupational HRA training and the prerequisite required for 7-skill level award.   7.4.2.2.  Environmental Health Measurements (EHM):  The newly added EHM course, directed by the 2012 enlisted U&TW, provides critical advanced environmental HRA training.  This course is not required for UGT.  7.4.2.3.  Bioenvironmental Engineering Readiness and Deployed Skills (BERDS):  The new BERDS course replaces the Bioenvironmental Engineering Emergency Management Response (BEEMR) Part I (ADL) and Part II (in-resident) courses.  The BERDS course provides training on critical skills necessary for deployments and Home Station Medical Response (HSMR), and is designed to eliminate readiness and deployment skills gaps that were identified during the 2012 U&TW.  The BERDS course is identified as an advanced course in the STS (Part II, Section A of this CFETP).  This course is not required for UGT. 7.4.2.4.  Bioenvironmental Engineering Nuclear Enterprise and Radiation (BENER):  The BENER course provides training on critical skills necessary to eliminate radiation skills gaps identified in the 2011 Radiation Skills Capability Gap Analysis and the 2012 U&TW.  The BENER course has been identified as an advanced course on the STS (Part II, Section A of this CFETP).  This course is not required for UGT, however, attendance is required within six (6) months of assignment as either a primary or an alternate AF Radiation Assessment Team (AFRAT) UTC member.   24 7.5.  Proficiency Training.  BE Total Force must be fully capable of performing mission critical tasks in support of expeditionary operations and the BE career field needs a critical skills sustainment framework that better supports common operating practices and proficiency training expectation.  As such, 3rd Party certifications were voted in on all core tasks and use of AFQTP mandated.  More proficiency training is needed with a standard required level of performance within the constraints of competing demands for a BEF’s time.  Budget and time constrain any skills sustainment framework.  The fiscal forecast is that budgets will shrink across the FY16-19 Future Years Defense Program and program managers will seek ways to cut costs.  Historically, the TDY for training budget is one the first funding lines to be decremented.  Therefore, representatives agreed to priority focus on central development of standardized supplemental training tools that include the right balance of OJT, proficiency training, continuation training, as well as certification via participation in USAFSAM Proficiency Analysis Testing (PAT) to maintain currency/qualification in special tasks and positions is required.  This preserves the ability to conduct training and refresher training by a sequestered force and allows apportionment of limited training dollars towards a limited number of mission critical formal and advanced training courses.  This resourcing strategy reinforces flight leader accountability for supplemental training while defending formal courses necessary for training that cannot be accomplished at an air base. 8.  CCAF.  CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel serving in specific AF occupational specialties.  The college is the largest multi-campus community college in the world and is regionally accredited through Air University (AU) by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award AAS degrees.  Upon completion of basic military training (BMT) and assignment to an AF career field, all enlisted personnel are automatically registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to obtain an AAS degree.  In order to be awarded, degree requirements must be successfully completed before the student separates from the AF, retires, or is commissioned as an officer.  See the CCAF website for details regarding the AAS degree programs at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/. 8.1.  CCAF Degree Requirements.

NOTE:  Physical education credit awarded for BMT not resident credit. 8.2.  Professional Certifications.  Certifications assist the professional development of our Airmen by broadening their knowledge and skills.  Additionally, specific certifications may  award collegiate credit by CCAF and civilian colleges, saving time and AF tuition assistance (TA) funds.  It also helps Airmen to better prepare for transition to civilian life.   To learn more about professional certifications and certification programs offered by CCAF, visit http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/certifications.asp.  In addition to its associate degree program, CCAF offers the following certification programs and resources:   27 8.2.1.  CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC) Program.  CCAF offers the three-tiered CIC Program for qualified instructors teaching at CCAF affiliated schools who have demonstrated a high level of professional accomplishment.  The CIC is a professional credential that recognizes the instructor's extensive faculty development training, education and qualification required to teach a CCAF course, and formally acknowledges the instructor's practical teaching experience. 8.2.2.  CCAF Instructional System Development (ISD) Certification Program.  CCAF offers the ISD Certification Program for qualified curriculum developers and managers who are formally assigned at CCAF affiliated schools to develop and manage CCAF collegiate courses.  The ISD Certification is a professional credential that recognizes the curriculum developer’s or manager’s extensive training, education, qualifications and experience required to develop and manage CCAF courses.  The certification also recognizes the individual’s ISD qualifications and experience in planning, developing, implementing and managing instructional systems. 8.2.2.1.  Vectored Airmen candidates selected for a DSD assignment as an AFSC Instructor (TB0X1) must possess, as a minimum, a CCAF AAS degree in BE Technology or they must be actively pursuing and be within 1 year (i.e. 12 SHs) of completion.  A degreed USAFSAM faculty is necessary in order to maintain accreditation through the SACS. 8.2.3.  CCAF Professional Manager Certification (PMC).  CCAF offers the PMC Program for qualified AF NCOs.  The PMC is a professional credential awarded by CCAF that formally recognizes an individual’s advanced level of education and experience in leadership and management, as well as professional accomplishments.  The program provides a structured professional development track that supplements the EPME and CFETP. 8.2.4.  AF Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL).  The AF COOL program replaced the CCAF Credentialing and Education Research Tool (CERT).  The AF COOL provides a research tool designed to increase an Airman’s awareness of national professional credentialing and CCAF education opportunities available for all AF occupational specialties.  The AF COOL also provides information on specific occupational specialties, civilian occupational equivalencies, CCAF degree programs, AFSC-related national professional credentials, credentialing agencies, and professional organizations.  The AF COOL contains a variety of information about credentialing and licensing and can be used to assist Airmen to: 8.2.4.1.  Get background information about civilian licensure and certification in general and specific information on individual credentials including eligibility requirements and resources to prepare for an exam. 8.2.4.2.  Identify licenses and certifications relevant to a particular AFSC. 8.2.4.3.  Fill gaps between AF training/experience & civilian credentialing requirements. 8.2.4.4.  Acquire information on funding opportunities to pay for credentialing exams and fees.  8.2.4.5.  Learn about available resources that can help acquire civilian job credentials. 8.2.5.  AFI 41-104, Professional Board and National Certification Examinations. Implements AFPD 41-1, Health Care Programs and Resources, and provides requirements and procedures for applying to take professional board or national certification examinations for medical enlisted personnel.  Specialty certifications that require periodic recertification examinations with annual educational curricula as part of the recertification process, during the interval between examinations, may be reimbursed associated costs and expenses.  It is important to check the AFI and local policies prior to committing to and incurring any costs.  Finally, some certifications require the payment of 28 annual or recurring membership fees which may be the sole responsibility of the member to pay.  It is critical to make informed decisions about certification examinations and their requirements. 8.2.5.1.  The following list provides the current and approved certifying agencies for 4B0X1 enlisted members.  The list is maintained in the AFMS Knowledge Exchange (Kx) at: https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx5/AFMedicalCorps/Pages/AFI-41-104-List-of-Certifying-Agencies.aspx.  The list is also referenced in AFI 41-104, the source document for AFMS national certifications and examinations for medical enlisted personnel.  Table 1.  BE Approved Certifying Agencies Certifying Agency Certification/Examination Title BE Approved Certifying Agencies American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH) ABIH Board of Certified Safety Professionals National Registry of Radiation Protection Technologists National Registry of Environmental Professionals National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) NOTE:  Asterisk (*) identifies those certification required for an AFSC or duty position. Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) Occupational Health and Safety Technologist (OHST) Certified Safety Professional (CSP) Nationally Registered Radiation Protection Technologist Registered Environmental Manager (REM) *HAZMAT Operations Certification  8.3.  Other Certifications.  A variety of State level certifications exist in areas such as asbestos, lead based paint and drinking water analysis.  Some certifications are Federal or State requirements governing the certification of BE personnel and certain operator functions. 8.4.  Off-Duty Education/Undergraduate and Graduate Degree Programs.  Additional off-duty education is a personal choice for all qualifying Airmen.  The AF is committed to education and offers a number of financial assistance programs to help our Airmen at all levels with education.  After earning a CCAF AAS Degree in BE Technology, both Airmen and the AF benefit when enlisted members pursue relevant undergraduate degrees in approved civilian universities during off-duty time.  Establishing an individual transition plan (ITP) for the enlistment period for developmental education is advised.  Doing so creates a career-ready military and provides service members, from the start of their military careers, a continuous opportunity to prepare for career readiness success.  For more information on the various enlisted education benefits and enlisted commissioning programs available in the USAF, visit the official USAF website, specifically review the ‘Enlisted Education’ section located at:  http://www.airforce.com/benefits/enlisted-education/ 8.4.1.  Education - ITP.  The ITP is the framework for success in any education objective and goal.  Framework planning to set and achieve realistic educational goals based upon individual need, helps provide the clear map of the transitional milestones that occur while serving in and beyond a tour of duty in the USAF.  In doing this, individual actions and activities associated with the ITP become clearly organized and individuals are more capable to visualize and associate activities into manageable and achievable tasks and milestones.  When the educational aspects of an ITP are created, proactive and productive modification may occur at any time in response to change in circumstance.  In addition, supervisors, mentors/sponsors and counselors are better able to support achievement of goals with the information required to assist and knowledge empower individuals to make informed decisions.  Find out more information from local A&FRC and Base Education Offices.  Assistance is available through college education counselors and by attending the Transition Goals, Plans, Success (GPS) Education Workshop hosted on most AF or JB locations, or accessed/taken on-line via the “Accessing Higher Education Course” designed to guide individuals through the variety of decisions involved in choosing a degree completion program, college 29 institution, and funding, as well as completing the admissions process.  After completing this program, individuals will be prepared to develop a customized plan for a successful transition to a higher education institution.  (URL:  http://jko.jten.mil/courses/tap/TGPS%20Standalone%20Training/start.html)  8.4.2.  Relevant BE Undergraduate Programs.  In addition to the CCAF program, BE Airmen may pursue opportunities to use their TA benefit towards earning an undergraduate or graduate degree through a civilian university.  Universities offer a variety of degree programs and sometimes finding a degree program relevant to the BE career field may be challenging.   Relevant degree programs in Biology, Industrial Hygiene, Chemistry, Physics, Health Physics, and Engineering may be used for 4B0-to-43E requirements while engineering sciences, engineering technology, and homeland defense are useful to further developmental education related to the BE career field.  When selecting a degree program, it is important to know the accreditation for which the college or university has been awarded.  Accreditation assures quality based on a defined nationally endorsed standard or guidelines.  In turn, accreditation makes it more likely the curriculum will assist graduates’ preparedness to enter into (or advance) in the profession of choice.  However, it is not a guarantee for transferring credits, achieving dreams, finding a great post military service job, or making lots of money (though some or all of these things may happen).  For core educational requirements in math and science, taking courses with laboratories offered at local brick-and-mortar universities should be used and then the remaining education may be accomplished through on-line or hybrid studies.   8.4.3.  Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).  ABET is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization that accredits college and university programs in the disciplines of applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology.  ABET is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and is valued in the BE profession; as well as valued as a requirement in meeting academic standards for ‘4B0-to 43E Accession Program’ candidacy/consideration.  ABET accredits programs at many levels; therefore, look for programs at the full engineering (Engineering Accreditation Commission) level not the technology, computing or applied science level.  When researching engineering degrees, most of the program titles end in the word ‘engineering.’  NOTE:  To search accredited programs meeting the ABET Accreditation Criteria that are in effect at the time of specified review, visit the www.abet.org site or specifically search the ABET Accredited Search tool option located at:  http://main.abet.org/aps/Accreditedprogramsearch.aspx. 8.5.  Enlisted-to-AF Institute of Technology (AFIT) (E2A) Program.  The E2A program is a unique element of enlisted professional development.  In conjunction with other training and education programs, resident AF Institute of Technology (AFIT)-sponsored science, engineering, and management graduate degree opportunities further develop a NCO’s technical education and skills.  Ultimately, this program provides enhanced combat capability for diverse career fields with positions requiring a higher degree of education.  This opportunity is one of many that comprise deliberate force development, and therefore members should expect a permanent change of station (PCS) upon graduation to fill duty positions coded for the respective advanced academic degree.  Post-graduation duty assignments are directed through the AFPC/DPAA, and AFPC/DPAO FMs in coordination with AFCFMs.   8.5.1.  BE personnel may be academically eligible to apply for admission to one of three graduate programs offered by the Graduate School of Engineering and Management at the AFIT (AFIT/EN):  Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction, Environmental Engineering and Science, or Industrial Hygiene. 30 8.5.2.  The E2A selection board typically convenes in the month of February, and academic year application deadlines and milestones are centered around that date.  In general, interested applicants are advised to seek counsel and to work with supervisors, mentors, and academic advisors to coordinate and to submit completed admission package requirements in anticipation of submission deadlines.  Selections are based on the member’s record as well as the return on investment for the AF.  8.5.3.  Interested applicants are encouraged to visit the AFIT/EN website at www.afit.edu/en/admission or contact an admissions counselor at:  http://www.afit.edu/en/admissions/contact.cfm?contact=admissions or DSN 785-6234 extension 3184 for assistance.  In addition, 4B0X1s may contact the two (2) AFIT School of Engineering and Management professors by dialing (937) 255-3636, option 4 for ”Departments”, then option 3 for the Department of Systems and Engineering Management (ENV).  Ask for the Director of the degree program being considered or by web http://www.afit.edu/ENV/.  BE AFIT Faculty AF biographies can be accessed here on the BE Functional area of the AF Portal: https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/browse.do?programId=t88B4F00B42E99C6901437CA4EA360A70&channelPageId=s2D8EB9D6408E0AD001414B3FCEDF1549 8.6.  4B0-to-43E Accession Program.  The 4B0-to-43E Accession Program offers active duty (AD) BE enlisted personnel the opportunity to apply for a commission as an AF BE Officer.  Applications are accepted when there are available accession quotas and the applicant competes favorably with individual academic, experience, and performance records plus the requirements for application submission and consideration for the BE accession board are met.   8.6.1.

The Language Enabled Airman Program (LEAP).  The LEAP is a career-spanning program to sustain, enhance and utilize the existing language skills of general purpose force Airmen.  The objective of LEAP is cross-culturally competent leaders across all AF specialties with working level foreign language proficiency – leaders that can meet AF global mission requirements.  LEAP is a volunteer program open to officers and enlisted Airmen in most AFSCs.  To become a participant in LEAP, Airmen must already possess moderate to high levels of proficiency in a foreign language specified on the AF Strategic Language List.  LEAP is managed by the Air Force Culture and Language Center, part of AU’s Spaatz Center at Maxwell AFB, AL.  For more information, visit www.culture.af.mil. 8.7.1.  International Health Specialist (IHS).  Teaming with the IHS professionals fits well with the BE occupation given our broad spectrum of joint health risk management (JHRM) capabilities delivered in global occupational, environmental, radiological and nuclear as well as emergency and deployed operating spaces. The IHS experience strengthens individual institutional competencies, BE occupational competencies and makes both the unit and individual a global asset that may be leveraged when needed.  BE craftsman who possess the highest level of demonstrated proficiency and mastery of the occupational and institutionally- valued competencies, and who possess foreign language and cultural communication skills make excellent candidates to support this diverse and challenging global health engagement opportunity.  The IHS works closely with U.S. embassy personnel to coordinate U.S. military support, interagency HADR and health care infrastructure development.  Additional opportunities exist to broaden experiences through the IHS professional program through the defense attaché, courier, and embassy SDI positions.  8.8.  Air Force Virtual Education Center (AFVEC).  Airmen may access multiple CCAF self-service options via the AFVEC application on the AF Portal or via the AU CCAF website at http://www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/catalog/2008cat/deg_req_two.htm or refer to the CCAF General Catalog for specific degree requirements.   8.9.  Base Education Office.  In addition to serving as the point of contact for distance learning (DL) and as the focal point for the CCAF and AU’s Associate-to-Baccalaureate Cooperative, the Base Education Office assists members obtaining transcripts from other colleges and junior colleges for submission to the CCAF.  Counseling is provided to members on classes that are required to receive CCAF degree, as well as counseling on professional certifications.  Please visit the Base Education Office for education questions and serve as a liaison to education. 9.  Career Field Path.

Flat Career Path Pyramid  USAF Bioenvironmental Engineering  NOTE:  TIS based on AF 2013 promotion rates 9.1.  Career Path Tool (CPT).  The CPT provides a clear picture of the BE enlisted career field and the key developmental and leadership building opportunities within it such as:  core BE functional developmental areas, key BE roles, KLPs/KDPs, and opportunities for progressive movement in the career field and the USAF.  Using the CPT, in conjunction with the CFETP and other support tools/resources, empowers the BE enlisted force to identify with current functional roles and/or current institutional roles.  Additionally, using the CPT helps Airmen understand how that role fits in the AF, the AFMS, and the career field force development pathway.  The CPT assists Airman with establishing individual career readiness goals by helping them understand where they are now versus where they want to be in the future.     9.1.1.  The CPT may be used for a variety of purposes.  For individual use, these five key steps are suggested as a starting point: 9.1.1.1.  Identify current role on the CPT and how role fits in the AF, AFMS, and BE function. 9.1.1.2.  Investigate career options and career goals. 35 9.1.1.3.  Identify ultimate career goals, career path, and the knowledge, skills and abilities  required to achieve goals. 9.1.1.4.  Identify opportunities for development which will provide for career progression.  9.1.1.5.  Identify opportunities for development, professional or otherwise. 9.2.  The CPT may be accessed here on the AF Portal:  https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/contentView.do?contentType=EDITORIAL&contentId=c2D8EB9D6408E0AD00141846ADD7C1CBD&channelPageId=s6925EC134EE60FB5E044080020E329A9&programId=t2D8EB9D6408E0AD001418465A93F1CBC 9.3.  Mentorship.  Mentorship is a critical component of the AF's Force Development construct.  Mentorship is normally a relationship in which a person with greater experience and wisdom guides another person to develop both personally and professionally and is designed to prepare Airmen for increased responsibilities.  9.3.1.  Mentoring Benefits:  There are several benefits to a mentoring relationship, to include receiving further professional career development, enhancing capacity to translate core values and strategies into productive actions, and increasing mastery of the institutional and occupational competencies.  Enlisted members are encouraged to engage in building and maintaining a productive relationship with a mentor.  A logical choice for a mentor is a supervisor.  While the immediate supervisor should be a logical choice for a professional mentor, they may not always be the best one.  Should the immediate supervisor not be a good fit, Airmen might instead look for a professional mentor a couple of levels higher up the career ladder.  This person may be a BE enlisted, commissioned officer or civilian, or work in a completely different AFSC.  If interested in a BE mentor, review the AF biographies of many BE SELs here on the AF Portal in the BE Functional Area:  https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s2D8EB9D6408E0AD001414B3FCEDF1549&command=function&parentCategoryId=s2D8EB9D6408E0AD001414B3FCEDF1549 9.4.  Military Life Cycle Transition Assistance Plan (TAP):  The key to a successful transition is career readiness planning, which requires a carefully thought out ITP incorporated into the entire span of a service member’s career.  In the past, transition and preparation for the civilian workforce occurred late in a service member’s time in the military – near the point of separation.  Under this new program, these concepts will be incorporated earlier to ensure that the counseling, assessments, and access to resources to build skills or credentials occur at earlier stages of a service member’s military tenure.  The ITP provides a framework to achieve realistic career goals based upon an assessment of personal and family needs as well as unique skills, knowledge, experience, interests and abilities.  Airmen create and maintain their ITP with assistance from supervisors, mentors, and other advisors.  The ITP coincides with the Transition GPS outcome-based curriculum and provides a means to discover and explore individual skills and interests which may lead to potential post-transition career paths.  The ITP helps Airmen identify critical activities associated with transition and will assist through the process of organizing transition into manageable tasks.  The ITP also helps Airmen to establish a timeline for completing all required activities prior to separation – it is a living document and can be modified at any time.  The ITP is the individual Airman specific road map for attaining employment, education, technical training, and entrepreneurial objectives and can help make a successful transition to civilian life.  To develop a successful career ready ITP, consider the following critical elements depicted in Figure 3 in your planning process:   36 Figure 3.  Military Life Cycle TAP with Career Readiness Standards  37 Figure 4.  Enlisted Force Development Plan:  AFSC 4B0X1.  For correlation to the career ready ITP pictured in Figure 3, the following graphic depicts military career progression and succession.  Understanding how the two figures relate to ITP are solid discussion points to incorporate into mentorship sessions for both progress and success in and out of the USAF.   10.  Occupational Badges.  AF members are highly encouraged to wear their current occupational badge on all uniform combinations.  After meeting certain criterion, 4B0X1 Airmen are authorized to wear the medical enlisted corp occupational badge.  A maximum of two (2) occupational badges may be worn.  When wearing two (2) occupational badges, wear the one (1) representing the current career field (regardless of level earned) in the top position.  Exception:  Chaplains and aeronautical badges are always worn in the top position when wearing two (2) occupational badges.  If authorized, place the second occupational badge in top position and centered ½ inch above the first one.  Display the first or sole occupational badge centered ½ inch above the top row of ribbons or above the left pocket if not (reference AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel).   38 10.1.  Basic – A BEAs wears the basic medical enlisted corp badge after graduating technical school:     10.2.  Senior - A BE Craftsman wears the senior medical enlisted corp badge after attaining a 7-skill level:       10.3.  Master – A BE Craftsman (must be a MSgt) wears the master medical enlisted corp badge after 5 years in specialty from award of the 7-skill level:       11.  Table 3.  Manning.

Journeyman Level Training Requirements (4B051):  Airmen in UGT are expected to exclusively practice OEH risk surveillance activities to learn and develop through experience in executing task orders that require routine practice with and varied application of equipment in sample analytical planning and related data collection.  It is critical that BE journeyman exact standards of performance associated with data collection that is central to informing Force Health Protection decisions and range from sample collection and analysis, quantifying noise, chemical, radiological/nuclear, HFs (ergonomics) levels and associating exposures to humans and the environment.  13.2.1.  Journeyman Specialty Qualification (4B051).  Qualified on all 4B031 knowledge and task qualification requirements are mandatory.  Certification at the journeyman level indicates the ‘skilled’ capability to carry out a restricted number of work tasks in the BE occupation.  Tasks carried out are part of the complete portfolio of work for a ‘skilled’ 4B071 craftsman, but restricted in scope.  The scope is restricted because journeymen operate at a restricted level until they obtain sufficient experience to be fully aware of the implications of their task/work activities and the interdependencies between those work activities and the mission enabling capabilities being supported.  Since OJT requirements follow a rank-order proceeding from the simple to the more complicated tasks, focus on learning and doing the required tasks that strengthen, broaden and demonstrate mastering competencies constituting the enterprise skill level for apprentice seeking journeyman skill certification.  The 4B0X1 Airman’s immediate supervisor manages the member’s 5-skill level UGT curriculum to include CDC enrollment, fulfillment of OJT requirements, and continuation plus proficiency training requirements.   13.2.1.1.  Journeyman Specialty Qualification (4B051) 4B051 Knowledge -BE aspects of medical readiness. -OEH risk assessments. -IH principles. -Basic and applied mathematics. -Nuclear and Radiological health and safety principles. -Basic chemistry, physics, and computer hardware/software operations desirable. -Requirements are the same as for the 3-skill level (listed in paragraph 13.1.1.). 4B051 Education 4B051 Training -The STS (Part II, Section A of this CFETP) identifies all the core tasks required for skill level upgrade qualification and other duty position tasks identified by supervisor. -Completion of the 4B051 CDC.  -Completion of applicable AFJQSs/AFQTPs. -Desirable:  Training in computer operations, OEH risk assessment and regulating directives. 41 4B051 Experience -Verified USAFSAM 4B031 award and associated task knowledge qualifications. -Broaden and master journeyman technician skills by serving directly under a qualified 4B071 or higher skill level qualified BE member.  Typical task assignments at the entry level include, but are not limited to, initially participating as a team member and helper/assistant in all technical tasks of BE program execution requirements.  Helper roles increase breadth and depth of experience learning events and enhance the fundamental application and critical thinking skills required to certify foundational core competencies needed to succeed in the 4B0X1 AFSC.  Once certified and competent, supervisors expand individual’s responsibility to tasks requiring less supervision and oversight.    OEH/IH  Radiological and Nuclear Health and Safety  Water Quality/Sanitation  BE Emergency Response Team   Activities associated with incidents of natural and manmade disasters. -Concentration in exposure data collection with routine/non-routine special surveys that are part of larger overarching and full spectrum preventative medicine program areas and OHRM.   Execute the Thermo-Luminescent Dosimeter (TLD) program (i.e. exchange, enroll & remove personnel) and monitor results.   Conduct Respiratory Protection (RP) Program qualitative & QNFT and training of enrolled members, to include gas masks.  Execute sample analytical plans:  collect air (breathing zone/ambient air), water, soil and material (bulk/ambient environmental) samples for a variety of contaminants using a variety of field portable, as well as sensitive analytical laboratory instruments.  Assess and collect data on physical hazards such as noise, thermal stress, ionizing/EMF/DE radiation, ergonomics and HFs.    Assess hazard controls (engineering (industrial ventilation) etc.), personal protective equipment (PPE) (RP, etc.), administrative controls (regulated area controls, etc.).  Collect, analyze & record drinking water system samples; maintain drinking water equipment and laboratory standard methods of analysis  Prepare field laboratory media+ collection supplies/equipment; pre/post equipment calibration   Package & ship samples; maintain chain of custody & regulatory compliant sample registry  Record, receive and process sample results; record operating conditions + data measurements.  Maintain drinking water laboratories IAW Federal/State/Host Nation Federal Governing Stds  Maintain, use, and calibrate precision test equipment such as the HAPSITE, plus the maintain supplies, reagents, calibration gas and sensors associated with each piece of test equipment.   Maintain individual knowledge and skill proficiency on precision analytical equipment and direct reading instrumentation (DRI) used in special surveys.    Monitor/execute BE Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory & Medical Equipment Repair Center requirements.   Perform informatics & document workplace/community environment conditions/measures; associate data with exposure groups’ health risk in the ILER of the DOEHRS; contribute to DoD Registries.

AF BE Portal Groups  and Functional Area, BE Linked In, BE Facebook, etc. 13.3.  Craftsman Level Training Requirements (4B071):  Effective UGT includes both cognitive learning (thinking skills or the attainment of knowledge) and hands-on experience on a variety of tasks under a given skill.  For example, performing ventilation surveys could mean anything from completing a simple periodic face velocity or static pressure check to an initial or baseline survey on a complicated multi-duct, multi-hood system with a variety of instruments, including a liquid manometer.  A craftsman would be expected to have experience in completing both simple and technically demanding tasks alike. 13.3.1.  Craftsman Specialty Qualification.  All 4B051 knowledge and task proficiency qualifications; in addition to, certification at the 7-skill level indicates the ‘skilled’ capability to carry out an unrestricted and full spectrum activities in the BE occupation.  The scope of work is unrestricted as a craftsman is in command of the vocational autonomy to assess and to be fully aware of all the implications of their task/work activities in relation to possible interdependencies between different work activities/functions and mission enabling capabilities.  OJT requirements follow a progression of skills order, from simple to complex.  Since OJT requirements follow a rank-order of proceeding from the simple to the more complicated tasks, focus on learning and doing the required tasks that strengthen and broaden the scope of competencies and constitute an area of skill requirements mastered by journeyman seeking craftsman skill certification. 13.3.1.1.

BE Total Force Proficiency Training and Periodic Core Task Certification.  Our BE total force development strategy should render sustained individual knowledge and proficiency levels IAW enterprise objective knowledge and performance standards.  BE Airmen, whether in-garrison, deployed, or a member of an high performance expeditionary UTC team mission, BE Airman operate in a complex environment with operational team responsibilities and accountability to the career field, AME, AFMS, and the LAF (AFI 36-2640, Executing Total Force Development).  Training is vital to competence and confidence in proficiently executing core and mission essential tasks (METs) central to BE mission-enabling capabilities.  Proficiency training accomplished as specified in this section fills the knowledge and proficiency gaps that build on baseline knowledge or proficiency gained from the initial skills training, OJT, UGT, and position/task qualification training.  In BE operational environments, the work “setting” rapidly changes from industrial, environmental, radiological/nuclear, and readiness response/contingency operating spaces.  The cross-cutting fundamentals associated with individuals’ competencies and proficiency applying critical knowledge and executing critical tasks in greatly different operational settings remain core.  As such, certain core tasks require periodic proficiency recertification and may require a certain level of ‘refresher’/proficiency, and/or continuation training based on locally-determined training needs assessments or the outcome of the standardized recertification.     46 14.1.  Special Task Certification and Recurring Training.  The AFCFM-directed special task certification requirements are centralized as home station training (HST) (i.e. in-service training) requirements.  The execution of the HST training requirements is decentralized; however, the certification of the 5-, 7- and 9- skill level is expected to be accomplished at the required time and frequency (when specified).  Recurring training execution requirements to support the special task certifications are recommended as part of the local annual HST plan.  Periodic refresher training and/or continuation training should supplement the HST plans as well as the proficiency and continuation training requirements that develop ready BE enlisted Airman skills and the leadership competencies required for various future operating environments and assignments.  Special task certification and recurring training specified in this context is not the sole source of training and certifying on individual’s currency, proficiency, and competency.  It is not intended to capture all core tasks requirements for 5-, 7- and 9- skill levels nor is the minimum periodic frequency proficiency the maximum allowed by the local leadership team.  Therefore, this framework identifies cross-cutting individual tasks critical to mission essential task list (METL) performance requirements, empowers local flight CCs to determine which individual Airman are current based on day-to-day operations assessed against the same proficiency qualification standard outlined in the AFQTPs.  The list of task certification and training requirements are not lengthy if the operational concept-to-METL-to-BE readiness skills/knowledge nesting methodology is applied in business as usual in the home station.  Smart planning and incorporation of developmental needs into existing requirements at the air base is prudent.   14.1.1.  AF IMT 1098.  The AFCFM directed requirements are established in the AF IMT 1098s.  The AF IMT 1098s are broken down into six categories based on requirements and are listed in the table below.  The forms may be found on the AF Portal BE Functional Area. Table 4.  AFCFM-Directed Special Task Certification and Recurring Training  AF IMT 1098: Established Mandatory for: Remarks: by: BE Equipment Certification AFCFM 4B051 & 4B071 Total Force  Sets minimum task qualification standard HAPSITE Recurring AFCFM 4B051 & 4B071 Total Force Sets additional randomized core tasks Training + Periodic Task Certification certifications above minimum standard; includes individual proficiency via local level 3rd Party certification BE MET Operational AFCFM 4B051, 4B071 & 4B091 Sets additional tasks above minimum Requirements Total Force standard BE Pre-Deployment Task AFCFM 4B0X1 “D” Coded – Tasked Sets additional tasks certification and Certification Deployers (NLT 120 days training above minimum and prior to deployment) MAJCOM standards USAFSAM PAT - AFCFM 4B051, 4B071 & 4B091 Sets additional tasks above minimum (Individual-Proficiency Analysis Testing (I-PAT) 3rd Party Certification) Total Force standard; includes individual proficiency via USAFSAM 3rd Party Proficiency Analytic Testing certification AF Radiation Assessment AFCFM Primary + Alternate 4B0X1 Sets additional tasks certification and Team Certification Assigned AFRAT UTC training above minimum standards Members  14.1.2.  Certification.  The larger overarching and complex matter of defining BE requirements and capabilities and associating the method of validating knowledge and skills with the multiple verification platforms must be addressed and balanced.  The continuous system designed for formal 47 needs assessment is implemented with Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and Facilities and foundational to the CoL objectives  (AFDD 1-1, Leadership and Force Development).  Once upgraded to the 5- and the 7- skill levels, BE forces must sustain proficiency and qualifications, as well as continue to deliberately develop for future duty positions.  With a combination of engagements in ‘doing’ or ‘practicing’ the tasks that demonstrate proper knowledge, skill proficiency is sustained and kept current and coupled with supplemental training, self-study, and deliberate work assignments based on staff needs assessment, Airmen are deliberately developed for current and new mission requirements at hand.  Doing this helps prepare and to develop Airmen with future assignments in mind; whether, the assignment is to replace a departing BE staff member, fulfill an upcoming AEF tasking, or PCS to a different location.  As defined in AFI 44-119, “Competency is demonstrated by performance in a designated setting, consistent with established standards of performance that are determined by the work setting and the individual’s role in that setting.”  Without a clear standard, the “proficient” or “non-proficient” rating is subjective from evaluator to evaluator and based on evaluator’s knowledge level.  To remove variance associated with the evaluator’s standard of performance and what is “proficient” and what is “non-proficient”, each trainer and certifier must utilize the AFQTPs and ensure the standards of performance are upheld.  In order to successfully assess individual skill level proficiency in BE, 3rd party task certifications via use of the AFQTPs or via USAFSAM PAT Program participation is required for certain core and MET.  In addition to the AFQTP specifications, the 3rd party certifications must be accomplished by and documented in accordance with AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, para 6.7.3., “Task Certifier Qualifications and Responsibilities” and documented using the 4B0X1 AFQTP Documentation Record.  14.1.3.  Decertification and Recertification:  The AFCFM-directed special task certification requirements are designated core tasks from the STS and/or foundational to individual competencies needed in support of UTC METs.  When a supervisor determines an Airman is unqualified on a task previously certified for in their duty position, the supervisor deletes certification when using the automated AFTR system.  Appropriate remarks pertaining to the reason for decertification are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, or automated version.  Begin recertification (if required) following procedures in AFI 36-2201, paragraph 6.9.6.1.3.  Taking a proactive approach, with all parties’ engaged in the AF Training Program, training managers and supervisors support proper staff development and training needs before a 3rd Party Certification is scheduled to occur.  Doing this may assist in avoiding unnecessary decertification and may continue to boost the confidence and willingness in members’ competencies to expand to greater challenges. 14.2.  BE HST Calendar:  A ‘BE HST Calendar’ is posted under the ‘Training’ section of the AF Portal BE Functional Area along with the accompanying AF IMT 1098s for trainees’, trainers, certifiers, supervisors and training managers’ use.  The calendar provides special task requirements contained in Table 3, AFCFM-Directed Special Task Certification and Recurring Training (reference CFETP paragraph 14.1.1.)  The training resources and currency platforms described are the proficiency training and currency platforms permitted for use to meet skill level standards of proficiency.  Actual work done and performance measured IAW AFQTP standards (real world work done, exercise events with recorded/measured objectives, USAFSAM advanced training course, and USAFSAM 3rd Party Certifications obtained via successful advanced training course completion or successful participation in the USAFSAM PAT Program may be accounted for proficiency training and certification in most cases.  NOTE:  Many of the tasks are existing operational requirements that provide BE enlisted Airmen the opportunity to get the mission done while demonstrating and gaining proficiency with proper oversight.  Proficiency will be assessed using the respective 48 AFQTPs for all periodic requirements that are STS listed core tasks or will be accomplished through USAFSAM PAT Program participation.   14.2.  BE RSV Tool.  This DL course is required for BE enlisted personnel returning from DSD or from serving outside the functional account code (FAC) 5311 for more than 365 days.  Course completion is required within 60 days of reintegration into a BE Flight or into 4B0X1 AFSC UMD authorization.  The RSV Tool addresses critical knowledge and skills through tailored application based scenarios.  The scenarios are designed to examine and to verify proficiency focusing on the individual’s currency and proficiency in selected STS line items.  When used in this capacity, the tool’s results are non-retribution.  Feedback from the RSV Tool provides the supervisor with an assessment of an individual’s knowledge level, as well as highlights areas requiring proficiency training attention in order to fully and successfully reintegrate Airmen into the role of BE after extended time away from the tasks and work practices.  Reference the chart located in Part II, Section C, paragraph 7.7 for DL course information. Part I, Section D - Resource Constraints 15.  Purpose.  This section identifies known resource constraints that preclude optimal/desired training from being developed or conducted, including information such as cost and manpower.  This section also includes narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training.  In addition, this section includes actions required, office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates.  Resource constraints will be, as a minimum, reviewed and updated annually.   16.  Reporting Job Proficiency Training Constraints - Units/MAJCOMS.   16.1.  Supervisors should report known resource constraints, that prevent personnel from completing the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan, to their unit EST manager.  The authority for requesting waivers is AFI 36-2101. 16.2.  In the report, provide a brief description of the resource constraints which adversely affect the training program and include the impact this constraint has or will have on training.  Identify the specific STS line item and task code(s) affected.  Also, provide a brief description of the resource needs to resolve the problem, including expenses, the corrective actions taken or to be taken, and the estimated completion date. 16.3.  If the constraint may be resolved at the local level, the report will be coordinated with the senior 4B0X1, and if the impact affects unit war skill requirements, the group CC.  If the constraint needs MAJCOM support, forward the report through your MDG/CC to the 4B0X1 MFM.  Constraints that cannot be resolved at the unit or MAJCOM level, or have a long term estimated completion date, must be forwarded to the 4B0X1 AFCFM as a request for waiver or deferment of CFETP requirements.      49 Part I, Section E - Transitional Training Guide.  There is currently no transition training requirement.  This area is reserved.  BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE     OFFICIAL                    THOMAS W. TRAVIS Lieutenant General, USAF, MC, CFC Surgeon General   50 Part II, Section A - STS 1.  Implementation.  This STS is used for technical training provided by the USAFSAM/OED for the initial skills BEA training course, implemented in May 2014, as well as for the USAFSAM BE advanced training courses offered and listed in Table 7.1.  Prescribed 5-skill level CDCs plus the 5- and 7-skill level AFQTPs are projected for publishing and implementation in November 2014.   2.  Purpose.  The STS is a guide for the development of promotion tests used in the WAPS.  SKTs are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by SNCOs with extensive practical experience in the career field.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the EPRRC.  Individual responsibilities are detailed in Chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System.  NOTE:  WAPS is not applicable to the ANG or Air Force Reserve Command.  IAW AFI 36-2201, this STS accomplishes the following: 2.1.  Lists Career Field Tasks.  Column 1 lists task line number and most common tasks, knowledge, and TRs necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 4B0X1 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9- skill level specialty, as described in the AFECD which can be accessed via the “myPers” website:  https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/7504/p/8,10/c/1363. 2.1.2.  Lists Core Tasks.  Column 2 identifies Core Tasks for specialty-wide training by either a (5 or 7) for the respective 5- and 7-skill level upgrade trainee.  Personnel in UGT to the 5-skill level must be trained and certified on all tasks annotated with a “5”.  Personnel in UGT to the 7-skill level must be trained and certified on all tasks annotated with a “7”.  Third party certification is required for certification and evaluation of any identified core tasks utilizing corresponding task’s AFQTPs located in the “AF e-Publishing” via the AF Portal.  In addition to the AFQTP specifications, the third-party certifications must be accomplished by and documented in accordance with AFI 36-2201, paragraph 6.7.3., “Task Certifier Qualifications and Responsibilities” and documented using the 4B0X1 AFQTP Documentation Record. 2.1.3.  Lists Wartime Tasks.  Column 2 also identifies AFSC specific contingency/wartime tasks with a “W” annotation.  Wartime tasks for the 5-, 7-, and 9- skill level indicate independent critical occupational knowledge and performance skills required to employ UTC’s war-fighting METLs.  The UTC METLs are critical tasks needed to deliver capabilities for combatant CCs to win the fight in contingency/wartime operating spaces.  The wartime tasks are identified by an analysis of the METLs associated with common BE UTCs (i.e. Prevention and Aerospace Medicine, Global Reach Laydown, Medical Nuclear Biological, Chemical Team, Special Operations Forces, Medical Augmentation, and AFRAT).  Individual wartime tasks essential to the success of the war-fighting mission are considered as “critical tasks.” Those critical tasks further identified as unique to the deployed environment (i.e. no garrison equivalent or conducted differently), not covered in approved supplemental training platforms, and/or highly valued skills that are perishable if not practiced as employed to meet combatant commander support requirements are identified in the AF IMT 1098.  Supervisors use the series of AF IMT 1098 provided in AFTR to document selected tasks requiring recurring training or evaluation at the minimum frequency specified by this CFETP.  The MAJCOM directives or local directives may identify additional tasks contained in the CFETP requiring special certification, recurring training, or evaluation.  This form may be overprinted and filed in the AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder.  For tasks requiring certification this form should remain in the training record until superseded or no longer required. 2.4.  Provides Certification for OJT.  Columns 3A through E provide space for documenting the initiation and completion of UGT.  51 2.5.  Shows Formal Training and Correspondence Course Requirements.  Qualitative requirements are described on page 54 which provides an area for trainee identification and a description of the AF Proficiency Code Key.  2.5.1.  3-Level Course Requirements.  Column 4A shows the task/subject knowledge and task performance proficiency levels attendees of the BEA Course will be trained in.  Graduates of the course are expected to perform the tasks and have the subject knowledge to the proficiency listed in the STS. 2.5.2.  5-Level OJT Requirements.  Column 4B shows task performance proficiency levels individuals in 5-level OJT are expected to achieve and perform. 2.5.3.  5-Level CDC Requirements.  Column 4B shows the task/subject knowledge proficiency levels graduates of the 4B0X1 Journeyman (4B051) CDC will be trained to.  Graduates of the course are expected to have the subject/task knowledge to the proficiency level listed in the STS. 2.5.4.  7-Level OJT Requirements.  Column 4C shows the task/subject knowledge levels and task performance proficiency levels individuals in 7-level OJT are expected to achieve and perform.   2.5.5.  Advanced Technical Course Requirements.  Column 4D shows the task/subject knowledge levels and task performance proficiency levels attendees of 4B0X1 advanced technical courses will be trained in.  USAFSAM provides graduates of advanced technical courses with a training report indicating by line item which task/subject knowledge and task performance proficiency levels were taught.  Advanced course graduates are expected to perform the tasks and have task/subject knowledge at the proficiency levels listed in the STS. 2.6.  Qualitative Requirements.  Page 54 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of subject/task knowledge and task performance level provided by in-residence training, CDCs, and OJT.   2.7.  AFJQS.  Used for OJT when placed in the Enlisted Training and Competency Folder and used according to AFI 36-2201.  When used as a AFJQS, the following requirements apply:  2.7.1.  Documentation.  Training documentation will be accomplished in AFTR accessible from the AF Portal via the Advanced Distributed Learning System (ADLS).  As a minimum, complete the following columns in Part II of the CFETP:  Start Date, Complete Date, Trainee’s Initials, and Trainer’s Initials.  An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the 4B0X1 AFCFM.  NOTE:  The 4B0X1 AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for the AFS. 2.8.  EPRRC.  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the Air Education & Training Command (AETC) Airman Advancement Division by SNCO SMEs with extensive practical experience in their AFS.  The SKT portion of the samples knowledge of the STS subject matter areas judged to be most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the most current EPRRC located on the AF Portal (URL: http://cdc.aetc.af.mil/apex/f?p=300:9:316441373675226).  Individual responsibilities are in Chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605.     52 3.  Recommendations.

Location USAFSAM AFRRI - USUHS Part II, Section F - Documentation of Training (AFMS-specific section) 11.  Development of a Work Center Training Plan and Enlisted Training & Competency Folder.   11.1.  Work Center Training Plan.  The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines and examples of proper documentation for the many electronic forms used in training of all enlisted medical personnel.  Training documentation helps to assess readiness capability, individual strengths and weaknesses.  It also aids compliance with all Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, The Joint Commission, Commanders Inspection Program, and Unit Effectiveness Inspections requirements.  The AFTR is accessible from the ADLS via the AF Portal.  Refer to your UTM for the current policies and guidance on training documentation. 82 11.1.1.  MTP. 11.1.1.1.  A MTP is a reference guide developed for each section that includes all facets of training for individuals assigned.  It is used as a reference source for the type of training and training documentation that occurs with each assigned member.  The MTP is used to standardize training and provide trainers, trainees, supervisors, and NCOICs an overview of the training process for the duty section.  Training managers will incorporate the MTP into AFTR. 11.1.1.2.  The MTP is an overview of training for the duty section, and should include all information involved in the training process for the duty section.  Training will vary from section to section and person to person; however, certain documents will be a standard requirement for all MTPs. They are listed below: 11.1.1.3.  Master Task List (MTL).  The MTL identifies all day-to-day mission (duty position) requirements, core tasks, local and contingency tasks, and additional duties performed by work center personnel.  11.1.1.4.  Current CFETP or AFJQS (if available). 11.1.2.3.  Locally developed AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS, which is now accessible in AFTR. 11.1.1.5.  Milestones for tasks and CDC completion (identify the projected time frame the trainee will complete their core tasks and each set of CDCs as required). 11.1.1.6.  Unit-Specific Orientation Checklist. 11.1.1.7.  Job descriptions and performance standards. 11.1.1.8.  Required AFQTPs. 11.1.2.  4B0X1 MTP Templates.  Established to provide a standardized 4B0X1 OJT program, qualification, and certification standards, 4B0X1 MTP templates have been developed by the USAFSAM/OED staff for 5 and 7-skill levels.  The plans outline the minimum mandatory training requirements (i.e. core tasks) for 4B0X1 Airmen in UGT and will assist with development to progress and succeed in the 4B0X1 career field.   11.1.2.1.  Divided into four (4) quarters, the 4B0X1 MTPs are based on the minimum 12-month OJT requirement.  Because the cross-trainee minimum UGT is six months, the first and second quarters can be combined as can the third and fourth quarters (NOTE:  The listed quarter requirements as shown in the MTPs are flexible based on topic).   11.1.2.2.   The MTPs are mandatory for use during UGT and periodic certification and are accessible through the BE Functional Area of the AF Portal.  A waiver must be submitted and approved by the 4B0X1 AFCFM for those flights unable to complete the MTP requirements (via your MFM).  11.2.  AFTR Documentation. 11.2.1.  AFTR serves as the single, automated repository for all medical EST.  Consult the most current AFTR training message for detailed instructions regarding automated training documentation requirements. 11.2.2.  Use the automated AFTR to document all training.  NOTE:  An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM.  The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for the career field.  Templates for BE specific training events are available for use via the AF Portal BE functional area.  Refer to your UTM for any additional policies and guidance on training documentation. 83 11.2.3.  The USAFSAM will initiate AFTR records upon enrollment of all students into the BEA Course.  Students and staff review and sign entries when required.  Additionally, the USAFSAM uploads training progress documentation and upon graduation, forwards the AFTR record to the gaining base. 11.2.4.  Transcribing a new or revised CFETP.  The 4B0X1 AFCFM provides transcription instructions to the AFTR program manager and field users.  This process is seamless to the field user as all existing trainee records are automatically and electronically transcribed. 11.2.5.  Decertification and Recertification.  IAW AFI 36-2201, when an Airman is found to be unqualified on a certified task, the supervisor shall delete the previous AFTR documented certification.  Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623A, explaining the reason for decertification.  The Airman is recertified using the normal certification process and AFTR is updated. 84 Abbreviations/Acronyms A1C – Airman First Class AAS – Associate of Applied Science AB – Airman Basic or Air Base ABET – Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology AD – Active Duty ADL – Advanced Distributed Learning AEF – Air and Space Expeditionary Force AF – Air Force AFCFM – Air Force Career Field Manager AFCLC – Air Force Culture and Language Center AF COOL – Air Force Credentialing Opportunities On-Line AFDW – Air Force District of Washington AFECD – Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory AFI – Air Force Instruction AFIT – Air Force Institute of Technology AFMOA – Air Force Medical Operations Agency AFMS – Air Force Medical Service AFMSA – Air Force Medical Support Agency AFOCD – Air Force Officer Classification Directory AFOTEC – Air Force Operational Test & Evaluation Center AFPC – Air Force Personnel Center AFPD – Air Force Policy Directive AFRAT – Air Force Radiation Assessment Team  A&FRC – Airman & Family Readiness Center AFQTP – Air Force Qualification Training Package AFRL – Air Force Research Laboratory AFRRI – Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute AFS – Air Force Specialty AFSC – Air Force Specialty Code AFTR – Air Force Training Record AFVEC – Air Force Virtual Education Center AIHA – American Industrial Hygiene Association 85 ALC – Air Logistics Center AMDS – Aerospace Medicine Squadron AME – Aerospace Medicine Enterprise ANG – Air National Guard AREC – Anticipate, Recognize, Evaluate, Control AT/FP – Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection AU – Air University BE – Bioenvironmental Engineering (formal acronym for official documents) BEA – Bioenvironmental Engineering Apprentice BEAW – Bioenvironmental Engineering Advanced Workshop BEE – Bioenvironmental Engineering (i.e. ‘branding’ the career field, its functions, people, logo and trademark) BEF – Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight BEO – Bioenvironmental Engineering Officer BET – Bioenvironmental Engineering Technician (i.e. BE enlisted) BMT – Basic Military Training BSC – Biomedical Service Corp CAA – Career Assistance Advisor CAFSC – Control Air Force Specialty Code C4ISR -

The POEMS are the official DoD approved documents that summarize health risks and associated medical implications resulting from occupational and environmental health (OEH) exposures identified at deployment sites over a period of time.  A standardized template for the POEMS for deployment sites has been created and concurred upon by the Joint Environmental Surveillance Work Group (JESWG).  Specifically, POEMS describe the types of exposure hazards (e.g., airborne pollutants, water pollutants, infectious disease, noise, heat/cold), summarize site data/information collected, and provide an assessment of the significance of any known or potential short term (during deployment) and long-term (post deployment) health risks to the personnel population deployed to the site.  In general, POEMS should reflect data and information collected from a year or more time at a site in order to adequately evaluate potential risks from long term exposures.  The primary audience of the POEMS is military force health protection personnel and health care providers.  To the extent that the available data allows, the POEMS describes the general ambient conditions at the deployment site and surrounding area, and characterizes the risks at the population-level.  While useful to inform providers and others of potential health effects and associated medical implications, it does not represent an individual exposure profile.  Actual individual exposures and specific resulting health effects depend on many variables and should be addressed in individual medical records by providers as appropriate at the time of an evaluation of a unique exposure.  The intent of POEMS is to satisfy the need for such population-level health surveillance information to be available, should 100 service personnel have OEH exposure-related concerns.
