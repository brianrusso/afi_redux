It is DoD policy to:   a. Recognize that IW is as strategically important as traditional warfare.  Many of the capabilities and skills required for IW are applicable to traditional warfare, but their role in IW can be proportionally greater than in traditional warfare.  b. Improve DoD proficiency for IW, which also enhances its conduct of stability operations.  Stability operations are a core U.S. military mission that the Department of Defense shall be prepared to conduct across the full range of military operations in accordance with DoD Directive 3000.05 (Reference (b)).   c. Conduct IW independently of, or in combination with, traditional warfare.    (1) IW can include a variety of steady-state and surge DoD activities and operations:  counterterrorism; unconventional warfare; foreign internal defense; counterinsurgency; and stability operations that, in the context of IW, involve establishing or re-establishing order in a fragile state.  (2) While these activities may occur across the full range of military operations, the balance or primary focus of operations gives a campaign its predominant character.   d. Explicitly integrate concepts and capabilities relevant to IW across all DoD activities including doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF); policy; analysis; exercises; experiments; and applicable strategies and plans.  e. Maintain capabilities and capacity so that the Department of Defense is as effective in IW as it is in traditional warfare in order to ensure that, when directed, the Department can:  (1) Identify and prevent or defeat irregular threats from state and non-state actors across operational areas and environments.    (2) Extend U.S. reach into denied areas and uncertain environments by operating with and through indigenous foreign forces.  (3) Train, advise, and assist foreign security forces and partners at the ministerial, service, and tactical levels to ensure security in their sovereign territory or to contribute forces to operations elsewhere.  (4) Through direct or indirect means, and on a large scale when required, support a foreign government or population threatened by irregular adversaries.     (5) Create a safe, secure environment in fragile states and, if required, provide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure restoration, and humanitarian relief.  (6) To meet Combatant Commander (CCDR) objectives, conduct other related activities abroad, including:  strategic communication; information, psychological, civil-military, intelligence, and counterintelligence operations; and support to law enforcement.     3 DoDD 3000.07, December 1, 2008 f. Establish mechanisms and authorities to increase DoD effectiveness in operating with and through foreign security partners.  g. Establish and sustain manpower authorizations, personnel policies, and organizational structures to provide sufficient capacity and expertise in both the DoD civilian workforce and Military Services to conduct activities in support of IW.    h. Synchronize appropriate DoD IW-related activities with the efforts of other U.S. Government agencies, foreign security partners, and selected international organizations by supporting:  (1) Collaborative policies, plans, and procedures, including collaborative training and exercises that promote interoperability, for steady-state and surge activities.   (2) Integrated civilian-military teams for steady-state and surge activities, and lead them if civilians are unable.  (3) Information strategies and operations to neutralize adversary propaganda and promote U.S. strategic interests.  (4) Exchange programs and rotational assignments that build DoD understanding of the functions and structures of other relevant organizations.   (5) Efforts to enhance information sharing, as appropriate, to increase situational awareness of irregular challenges.  i. Develop investment strategy guidance to address capability and capacity for IW-related activities and operations.    4.  RESPONSIBILITIES. See Enclosure.  5. RELEASABILITY.

SECRETARIES OF THE MILITARY DEPARTMENTSDepartments shall:    . The Secretaries of the Military a. Maintain military capabilities and track the capacity and proficiency of the Military Services to meet CCDR IW-related requirements in accordance with strategic guidance documents.  (1) (Added)(AF)   The Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans, and Requirements (AF/A3/5) shall ensure the U.S. Air Force (AF) shall continue to develop and maintain kinetic and non-kinetic, flexible capabilities, organizational structures, and processes to allow for rapid fielding and adaptability of systems and trained personnel to meet validated AF, U.S., and international partners’ IW-related requirements.  IW favors indirect and asymmetric approaches.  Where insurgencies or other threats have been allowed to mature and our partners can no longer contend with them alone, Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power provide the necessary options to defend U.S. interests in direct methods.  The AF/A3/5 shall prepare for such direct and indirect employment of the AF. (2)  (Added)(AF ) The direct application of air, space and cyber capabilities to IW requires evolution of operating concepts; tactics, techniques, and procedures; and command and control structures.  It also requires the addition of new material capabilities for the USAF toolkit, especially capabilities that can be effectively shared with partner nations. The long timelines for weapons development and the fielding of advanced capabilities must be significantly shortened.  The Air Force must adapt more quickly than the enemy. Therefore, the AF/A3/5 must enhance the adaptive nature of Air Force capabilities while creating additional capabilities for the indirect approach.  The AF/A3/5 must strike the right balance between conflict prevention via the indirect approach and costly reactive intervention, primarily through the direct approach.  Further, AF/A3/5 shall investigate and include joint and industry solutions to ensure training capacity is available to support weapon system procurement in accordance with legally established authority.  (3)  (Added)(AF)   The Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1), in coordination with the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR), shall track AF personnel capacity and proficiency in IW-related requirements, including foreign language, regional expertise, experience/expertise in assessing, training, advising, and assisting foreign security forces, and experience as part of OCONUS, forward-based general purpose forces (GPF).    As Executive Agent, the AF/A1, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR), shall maintain sufficient English language training capacity for partner nation personnel to support Geographic Combatant Command (GCC) Theater Campaign Plan (TCP) requirements.  Additionally, AF/A1 will ensure key overseas positions are manned within embassy country teams and GCC staff. b. Maintain scalable organizations to train and advise foreign security forces and security institutions (unilaterally or as part of civilian-military teams) in permissive and uncertain environments.   (1)  (Added)(AF)  U.S. strategy primarily employs an indirect approach through continued development and sustainment of relationships with partner nations (PNs) and strengthening coalitions.  The AF shall continue to develop, sustain, and expand 9                                                           ENCLOSURE DoDD 3000.07, December 1, 2008 relationships with partner nations.  By capitalizing on the global community of like-minded and similarly trained and equipped airmen,   the AF shall strive for regional solutions and strengthen relationships with partner Air Forces in order to build stronger coalitions that can stand against those state and non-state actors who strive to disrupt global security.  This includes traditional partners and developing nations which may have no air force, but aspire to or share U.S. values and interests.  Building the security capabilities and capacity of PN security forces and institutions focuses on preventing/deterring conflict by working with and through allied and coalition partners, and by better integration with civilian agencies and organizations.  By assisting foreign air forces in developing their organic airpower and support capabilities, Airmen can create an environment where mutual benefit and security can exist.  The broad capabilities supporting this indirect approach fall within the Building Partnerships (BP) Joint Capability Area and its component, Building Partner Capacity (BPC).  While relevant across the full range of military operations, BP and BPC are especially crucial in IW.  BP and BPC efforts shall develop capabilities with and through those nations which do not have those skills and capacity or in which the basic capability exists but requires enhancements and/or depth. (2)  (Added)(AF)  The AF/A3/5 shall ensure the AF maintains sufficient personnel and force structure in scalable organizations for presentation in Component Major Commands (C-MAJCOMs) and Component Numbered Air Forces (C-NAFs) to support GCC BP and BPC requirements.  These organizations shall sustain permanent GPF combat and advisory capabilities to meet steady-state, protracted requirements for permissive and uncertain IW environments and have the required capability and capacity to assess, train, advise, assist, and equip PN air forces.  These GPF capabilities complement existing special operations forces (SOF) advisory capabilities and enhance AF overall capabilities within the BP Joint Capability Area.  These AF GPF shall possess the ability to provide indirect means involving assessing, training, educating, advising and assisting foreign security forces, when authorized by law, within existing forward-based OCONUS and contingency response forces.  GPF must be prepared to participate in long term activities and post conflict stability operations necessary to build partner capacity and shape the environment.  To meet these full spectrum advisory requirements the AF/A3/5 shall evaluate and leverage the capabilities resident in overseas-based GPF, the Total Force, and the National Guard Bureau’s State Partnership Plan (SPP).  (3)  (Added)(AF)   AF/A3/5 formulates policy supporting IW.  AF/A3/5 determines operational requirements, capabilities and training necessary to support national security objectives and military strategy relevant to IW.   The AF/A3/5 shall be responsible for:   (a)  (Added)(AF)   The Air Force IW Strategy and ensuring its agreement with the Air Force Global Partnership Strategy.  (b)  (Added)(AF)   Defining AF organizational, training, and material requirements relevant to the IW environment, especially those Title 10 United States Code (USC) activities providing direct support involving combat. (c)  (Added)(AF)   Providing the representative to the BP Joint Functional Capabilities Board (FCB) (IAW CJCSI 3137.01D). 10                                                           ENCLOSURE DoDD 3000.07, December 1, 2008 (d)  (Added)(AF)   Ensuring IW-relevant planning is included within the AF Campaign Support Plan, the global posture, operations-to-operations/airman-to-airman talks programs, unified command plan reviews, and bilateral and multilateral exercises.   (4)  Added)(AF) The Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force, International Affairs (SAF/IA), in coordination with AF/A3/5, shall periodically review and adjust personnel training processes, procedures, and methodologies to optimize existing AF capacity to train international partners, as authorized by applicable statutes.  (5) (Added)(AF)   SAF/IA, in coordination with the GCCs with and through their C-MAJCOMS and C-NAFs and with the Service Core Function Lead Integrators, shall provide oversight and guidance on building international relationships, partner capacity, and interoperable capabilities that facilitate the successful employment of our joint and coalition expeditionary air, space, and cyberspace forces conducting global operations.  SAF/IA also provides oversight and guidance for international policy and programs supporting national security objectives through politico-military affairs, security assistance programs, technology and information disclosure, education and training, cooperative research and development, and attaché affairs.  SAF/IA shall be responsible for:   (a) (Added)(AF)   The overall strategy of building partnerships as expressed in the Air Force Global Partnership Strategy and ensuring its congruence with the AF IW Strategy. (b) (Added)(AF)   Overall advocacy—as the Building Partnerships Joint Capability Area Portfolio Manager—for all Building Partnerships capabilities to support Unified CCDRs’ activities in all operating environments to include IW. (c) (Added)(AF)   All equipping activities for foreign nations. (d)  (Added)(AF)   International participation in AF Exercises (excluding Component Command/component exercises). (6) (Added)(AF)   Air Combat Command (ACC) in conjunction with the C-MAJCOMS and C-NAFs, Air Mobility Command (AMC),  and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), in coordination with SAF/IA and AF/A3/5, shall create an air advisor institutional capability within the GPF, which will preserve the experience derived from efforts to stand up PN air forces.  The air advisor capability shall provide education and training to GPF air advisors and maintain a curriculum to develop air advisor expertise for forces across combatant commands.  This GPF advisory capability shall include education and training programs for the employment of advisors to assess, train/educate, advise, and assist partners in the development and application of their aviation resources and meet their needs in foreign internal defense (FID), security force assistance (SFA), counterinsurgency (COIN), global health engagement, stability, or counter-terrorism operations.   (7)  (Added)(AF)   Forward-based forces overseas within C-MAJCOMS and C-NAFs shall perform their day-to-day BP mission and follow the guidance of their CCDR. c. Maintain expeditionary units organized, trained, and equipped that, when directed, are able to provide civil security, restore essential government function, repair key infrastructure necessary to government function and to sustain human life, and reform or rebuild indigenous 11                                                           ENCLOSURE security institutions until indigenous, international, or U.S. civilian personnel can do so.   DoDD 3000.07, December 1, 2008 (1) (Added)(AF)  Integrated air, space, and cyberspace capabilities contribute critical support to PN and coalition ground forces to provide civil security, restore essential government function, repair key infrastructure necessary to government function and sustainment of human life, and reform or rebuild indigenous security institutions.  AF contributions to the joint, interagency, and coalition team include, but are not limited to:  mobility, ISR, theater command and control, precision strike, close air support, information operations (particularly, electronic warfare and military information support to operations), electronic warfare, agile combat support (ACS), show of force, aeromedical evacuation, military information support operations, airbase construction and opening, computer network defense, computer network attack, precision navigation, and strategic communication.  The AF/A3/5 shall ensure the AF maintains units organized, trained and equipped to present these capabilities as part of properly trained, forward-based OCONUS GPF units, contingency response forces (CRFs), air expeditionary GPF units, or in the NGB’s SPP unit forces, scaled or task-organized to meet CCDRs’ requests for forces.  The AF/A3/5 shall confirm the AF provides these capabilities through continuous planning, preparation, execution, and assessment for IW within AF joint or coalition components.    (Added)(AF)   The Deputy Chief of Staff  for Logistics, Installations & Mission Support (AF/A4/7) shall ensure Airmen leverage the ACS skill set to provide linguistic support, regional and cultural expertise, education, medical support, legal advice, civil engineering, public affairs, political-military support, and security training.   (2) (3) (Added)(AF) AETC and AMC shall ensure CRFs are trained to conduct ACS BP activities.  While the primary missions of CRF are airbase opening and USTRANSCOM’s Joint Task Force-Port Opening, the BP mission shall have distinct but complementary objectives.  The CRF BP mission set shall build habitual relationships with PNs.  Aligning CRF geographically will allow units to build an enduring relationship while growing in the cultures and languages of its region.  As with all their GPF units, PACAF and USAFE CRFs are geographically aligned for BP missions to their respective theaters.  AMC Contingency Response Wings (CRWs) shall meet regional objectives and be aligned with USSOUTHCOM and USAFRICOM.  Even though geographically aligned, CRWs shall maintain transferrable BP skills in order to support GCC or C-MAJCOMs and C-NAFs, as necessary.  Air National Guard CRFs are aligned in accordance with their state’s alignment under the NGB’s SPP.  The ANG shall have primary responsibility to integrate AF efforts into the NGB SPP.  Once tasked to fill a BP requirement, CRF shall coordinate directly with the C-MAJCOM or C-NAF leading the BP activity and ensure BP activities are carried out consistent with the law.    d. Ensure curricula in individual and unit training programs and Military Department schools prepare personnel for IW. Ensure all Service schools develop appropriate education and training programs and courses, reflecting joint and Military Department IW-relevant doctrine.  (1) (Added)(AF)  AETC, AMC, and ACC in conjunction with the C-MAJCOMs  and C-NAFs, shall train Airmen to operate in the irregular environment and ensure professional military education curricula at all levels includes AF contributions, lessons learned, and best practices in IW.  AETC shall ensure curricula in individual and unit training programs prepare Airmen for IW and schools develop appropriate education and 12                                                           ENCLOSURE training programs and courses in accordance with joint and AF IW doctrine, and educate AF operational planners to best apply air, space, and cyberspace power across the full range of military operations including IW.
