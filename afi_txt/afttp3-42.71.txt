Purpose.  This publication provides general operational and planning guidance on Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS) and Air Force Theater Hospital (AFTH) capabilities.  These capabilities are designed to support Air Expeditionary Forces (AEFs) during major combat, contingency, humanitarian assistance (HA), disaster relief (DR), defense support of civil authorities (DSCA), and stability operations.  This publication provides a source document for developing standardized policies, operating procedures, training programs, and allowance standards (AS).  Operation plans (OPLANs) and regional guidance provide more specific information that amplify and tailor the guidance contained in this publication.   1.2.  Background.  In September 1999, the United States Air Force Surgeon General (USAF/SG) approved the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the EMEDS/AFTH.  Since then, EMEDS has been the main deployable ground medical asset for a variety of contingency operations.  1.2.1.  Early Development.  In February 1998, the 366th Medical Group at Mountain Home Air Force Base (AFB) developed a requirements-based medical package to support Operation DESERT SCORPION.  This 24-person assemblage consisted of two squadron medical elements (SMEs), a mobile field surgical team (MFST), a critical care air transport team (CCATT), as well as dental, medical command and control (C2), and preventive medicine personnel.  It served as the basis for the current EMEDS concept.  1.2.2.  Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF).  In late 2001, using the EMEDS configuration, the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) was among the first functional areas to deploy to Southwest Asia in support of OEF.  The AFMS reengineered its tents, medical equipment, and supply packages in a continuing effort to reduce the EMEDS footprint and improve response timelines.  By 2002, the EMEDS+25 configuration was one-third the weight and size of the typical 25-bed Air Transportable Hospital (ATH) of the Gulf War era.  In January 2007, the Air Force assumed operational control (OPCON) of the U.S. Army combat support hospital at Bagram Airfield and began operating the newly opened Craig Joint Theater Hospital that spring.  The 50-bed facility includes a four-bed trauma bay, three operating rooms, and a dental clinic and is one of the most advanced hospital facilities in the theater.  1.2.3.  Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF).  From March 2003 to December 2011, EMEDS capabilities were deployed to multiple locations in support of OIF.  In 2004, the Air Force assumed operational control of the trauma care mission at Joint Base Balad from the U.S. Army.  The AFTH at Balad was a Role 3 trauma center and served as the theater’s surgical trauma hub.  In 2007, operations moved from an Army tent hospital to a new, approximately 100,000 square-foot facility with 20 critical care beds, 40 medical ward beds, and 8 operating tables.  The Air Force operated the AFTH at Balad until November 2011.   6  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 1.2.4.  Support for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR).  In 2005, the Secretary of the Air Force directed the USAF/SG’s Office to organize a medical-centric capability to respond to global disasters and humanitarian crises.  The Humanitarian Relief Operation – Operational Capability Package (HUMRO-OCP), which included EMEDS, contingency response group (CRG), and base operating support (BOS) components, was approved in 2006 and exercised in 2008 in Pacific Lifeline.  In October 2009, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) deployed a tailored version to support earthquake relief efforts in Padang, Indonesia.  In January and March 2010, tailored EMEDS+10 packages were deployed to support earthquake relief efforts in Haiti and Chile.  1.2.5.  Current Initiatives.  Based on lessons learned from operations in Indonesia, Haiti, and Chile, EMEDS capabilities have been reengineered to better support the full range of military operations and improve operational timelines.  Validated through rigorous testing during a force development evaluation in February 2011 and exercises in Trinidad and Peru, the EMEDS Health Response Team (HRT) replaces EMEDS Basic as the first increment of EMEDS capability.  EMEDS HRT adds a specialty care module that includes internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN), and pediatrics.  It adds international health specialist (IHS) support.  Pharmacy and radiology manning from the EMEDS+10 shifts to EMEDS HRT.  New quick-erect shelters significantly decrease setup time and can connect to the existing Alaska small shelter system.  Packaging improvements include a man-portable, functionally packed supply system, prioritized load plans, standardized packing lists, and secure, weather-proof containers.  See Attachment 20 for more information on the transition plan.  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  7 Chapter 2  CAPABILITIES  2.1.  Mission.  EMEDS and AFTH packages provide individual bed-down and theater-level medical services for deployed forces or select population groups.  The primary mission is to provide forward stabilization, resuscitative care, primary care, dental services, and force health protection and prepare casualties for evacuation to the next level of care.  The modular and scalable design allows the Air Force to deploy medical capabilities ranging from small teams that provide highly skilled medical care for a limited number of casualties to a large medical system that can provide specialized care to a population at risk (PAR) over 6,500.  EMEDS capabilities are grouped into distinct medical support packages that provide an incremental buildup of capability:  EMEDS HRT, EMEDS+10, and EMEDS+25.  AFTHs are built by adding medical specialty and augmentation unit type codes (UTCs) to an EMEDS+25 foundation.  See Attachments 2-3 for more information on EMEDS and AFTH UTC build-up.  2.2.  Scope of Care.  EMEDS facilities and AFTHs provide essential care, deferring definitive care as dictated by the theater medical CONOPS.  Deployed medical facilities normally do not provide reconstructive surgery or rehabilitative services.  2.3.  Assumptions.  Mission capabilities and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are based on the following assumptions:    Transportation is available to move personnel, equipment, and supplies.   Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) or BOS is available.  See Chapter 6 for more information on ECS/BOS requirements.  In combat operations, the PAR consists of the military population, emergency essential civilians and contractors, additive forces, and mobilization augmentees on base and excludes local nationals.  In HA/DR and stability operations, patient throughput projections are based on estimated injury and regional disease rates.   Deployed medical forces cannot depend on host-nation medical support.   The supported U.S. military population has received pre-deployment medical screening, prophylaxis, immunizations, Self-Aid and Buddy Care (SABC) training, and applicable reporting instructions.   Military personnel are either returned to duty or evacuated in accordance with (IAW) theater policy.  During HA/DR and stability operations, medical personnel will coordinate movement of civilian patients with host nation and local hospitals.   Members will deploy with, or have pre-positioned, adequate chemical warfare defense ensembles (CWDE) IAW reporting instructions.         8  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 2.4.  EMEDS Health Response Team (HRT).  EMEDS HRT is the first increment of EMEDS capability.  It can stabilize and hold four patients (three of which can be critical) for 24 hours.  Designed for rapid mobility and efficient setup, EMEDS HRT can deploy within 24 hours of notification, establish emergency room (ER) capability within 2 hours, operating room capability within 4 hours, and critical care capability within 6 hours.  It can reach full operational capability (FOC) within 12 hours of arrival.  Its primary goal is to stabilize patients and prepare them for movement to the next level of care.  Patient evacuation within 24 hours is critical to mission success.  EMEDS HRT is designed to support the early phases of military operations and requires reinforcement of personnel and equipment for operations longer than 10 days.  It includes specialized personnel and equipment UTCs that can be tailored in or out, depending on the mission.  EMEDS HRT is a Role 2 medical facility as defined in JP 4-02, Health Service Support.  2.4.1.  Combat Operations.  EMEDS HRT supports a PAR up to 3,000 and generally deploys with medical C2 and support services, surgical and critical care, flight medicine, dental, bioenvironmental engineering (BE), and public health support.  The initial equipment package provides an estimated 10 days of supplies, depending on patient volume.  2.4.2.  HA/DR and Stability Operations.  Medical support focuses on estimated throughput and is not linked to a PAR.  EMEDS HRT can triage and treat 350 patients per day with a surge capacity of 500.  The preexisting health status of the affected population and the scope and severity of the event will impact patient throughput and supply duration.  Due to anticipated high patient volumes, the estimate for initial supply duration is 5 days.  EMEDS HRT generally deploys with medical C2 and support services, surgical and critical care, primary care, dental, BE, public health, IHS, and specialty care support (OB/GYN, pediatrics, internal medicine).  2.4.3.  Personnel UTCs.  EMEDS HRT provides a maximum of 40 personnel organized in the following personnel UTCs.  See Table 2-1 for the manpower detail.  2.4.3.1.  FFEP1, Critical Care Team.  FFEP1 provides internal medicine and emergency medicine personnel to stabilize and prepare patients for movement to the next level of care.  The team can stabilize and maintain four patients (three of which can be critical) for 24 hours.  2.4.3.2.  FFEP2, EMEDS C2 and Administration Team.  FFEP2 provides medical C2, administration, logistics, and information systems support.  The team is led by a corps-neutral medical service colonel who functions as the EMEDS commander and a medical treatment facility (MTF) group superintendent who serves as the supervisor.  The health services management craftsman provides communications and information systems support and must be special experience identifier (SEI) 260 qualified.  2.4.3.3.  FFEP6, Nursing and Ancillary Support Team.  FFEP6 provides nursing personnel to support forward stabilization and holding.

FFMFS provides emergency medicine, general surgery, orthopedic, and operating room personnel to establish rapid-response resuscitative surgery and emergency medical support.  This team is equipped to operate in locations forward of established healthcare support systems and is the primary disaster medical capability for EMEDS.  FFMFS can provide resuscitative trauma surgery, advanced trauma life support (ATLS), and emergency medical care for 10 casualties requiring surgical intervention or for 20 non-operative resuscitations.  2.4.3.7.  FFP01, Specialty Care Augmentation Team.  FFP01 provides limited internal medicine, OB/GYN, and pediatric capability.  Note:  This UTC is operation dependent and typically supports HA/DR and stability operations.  2.4.3.8.  FFPCM, Primary Care Team, or FFDAB, Flight Medicine Team.  FFPCM provides medical support personnel to establish primary care for patients with routine and urgent conditions.  FFDAB substitutes for FFPCM if flight medicine service is required (e.g., for combat operations).  At least one aerospace medical service technician must be immunizations backup technician (IBT) qualified.  FFPCM and FFDAB usually deploy to an EMEDS facility; however, they can function as a stand-alone capability with the addition of FFLGE, Air Transportable Clinic (ATC).  See the Air Combat Command Concept of Operations for the Air Transportable Clinic (ATC), for more information.  2.4.3.9.  FFPM1, Preventive and Aerospace Medicine (PAM) Team 1.  FFPM1 provides initial public health and occupational and environmental health (OEH) assessment, surveillance, intervention, and abatement.  The team provides medical support planning and input into the layout of base facilities and operations.

The EMEDS+25 equipment package adds an ultrasonic cleaner and an additional sink.  24  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 Chapter 3  OPERATIONS  3.1.  EMEDS Unit Type Code (UTC) Posturing.  EMEDS UTCs are postured against units in the Unit Type Code Availability (UTA) database and Medical Resource Letter (MRL).  EMEDS equipment and facility infrastructure packages may be pre-positioned in theater based on requirements from geographic Combatant Commanders (CCDRs) and the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR).   3.2.  Deployment Planning.  Planners consider a number of factors, including pre-positioned materiel, host nation support agreements, contingency contracts, and acquisition cross-service agreements, in planning deployments and tailoring unit-level personnel and equipment requirements.  Time-phased force deployment data (TPFDD) is built by the air component and flowed through the MAJCOMs to the wing plans and operations centers for action.  3.3.  Deployment.  Upon receipt of an alert, prepare to deploy, warning order (WARNORD), or other notification from higher headquarters, the medical readiness office should conduct a pre-deployment conference and review key documents and responsibilities with the deploying EMEDS commander and UTC team chiefs.  This information may include the deployment order (DEPORD), TPFDD data, pre-deployment training requirements, force protection threats, and intelligence reports.  Deploying personnel should follow the pre-deployment requirements in AFI 10-403 and AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program Management.  3.3.1.  EMEDS Commander Pre-Deployment Tasks.  The EMEDS commander is responsible for ensuring that all deploying personnel and equipment meet the tasking requirements defined by the supported command.  The following paragraphs provide general guidelines on pre-deployment activities for EMEDS commanders.  3.3.1.1.  Establish Lines of Communication.  Meet with deploying EMEDS team members who are stationed with you and contact as many of the others as possible, using secure communication methods as necessary.  Consider setting up an email group and recall roster to keep the team informed and help build rapport.  Document events, key resources, contact information, and other useful reference materials for continuity records.  3.3.1.2.  Establish Command Structure.  Identify key leaders and establish a command structure.  If possible, draft an organizational chart, disseminate to staff members, and post prominently.  Medical personnel at the deployed location may be under separate chains of command and have missions that require the cooperation of personnel under different commanders.  For example, Air Mobility Command (AMC) medical and aeromedical evacuation (AE) personnel supporting AMC missions remain under the command of the Director of Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR).   AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  25 3.3.1.3.  Review Pre-Deployment Documentation.  Review pre-deployment documents, such as the WARNORD, operation order (OPORD), DEPORD, reporting instructions, and intelligence briefings.  Review personnel rosters and cargo lists.  3.3.1.4.  Conduct Personnel Assessment.  Work closely with the medical readiness office and Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO) to verify that all assigned personnel are eligible for deployment and meet mission training, pre-deployment health screening, and immunization requirements.  3.3.1.5.  Gather Information on Destination.  The AFFOR/SG staff can provide current medical and environmental intelligence on the deployed location.  Contact communications, intelligence, logistics, and security force units for information about the services and capabilities available.  If available, obtain base support plans and area maps.  Public health staff can provide information on local health threats.  IHS staff can provide information about the regional health structure, cultural considerations, language cards with common medical phrases and international symbols, and points of contact for the U.S. embassy, host nation military, and non-governmental agencies.  3.3.1.6.  Review Deployment Schedules.  The Deployment Control Center (DCC) will publish a deployment schedule of events (DSOE) to prepare units, personnel, and cargo to meet required delivery dates in theater.  Due to size, deployment sequence, or availability, units may be split and have to travel separately.  In this event, the senior line officer or enlisted member in the chalk will be appointed the troop commander.  This person is usually not a medical officer.  The EMEDS commander should check with the medical readiness office for information on personnel chalks, troop commanders, and transportation schedules.  Personnel and equipment might deploy separately (e.g., if equipment is not collocated with the deploying unit or when personnel are travelling by commercial air).  3.3.1.7.  Coordinate Required ECS/BOS.  Ensure that ECS/BOS needs are coordinated with the appropriate agencies before deployment.  To the extent possible, coordinate with supplying units in advance to exchange contact information, communicate arrival times, and negotiate support.   3.3.2.  Provider Credentialing.  To expedite privileging action, deploying medical units should provide an interfacility credentials transfer brief (ICTB) at least 15 days before the unit’s arrival date when possible.  Some host nations may require copies of various credentials such as licenses or Basic Life Support (BLS) or ACLS certification.  All clinical providers should have a copy of their ICTB and current privilege list.  3.3.3.  Equipment and Cargo.  UTC team chiefs should assess the deployability of assigned equipment UTCs with medical logistics personnel and identify shortfalls.  Deploying EMEDS commanders should ensure an adequate number of personnel are qualified in pallet build-up and cargo handling procedures (to include hazardous and protected cargo) to serve as cargo increment monitors during deployment and redeployment IAW AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement of Air Force Cargo, even if equipment is not collocated with the  26  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 team.  Note:  Most CONUS-based EMEDS equipment is stored at consolidated storage and deployment centers (CSDCs) and is not collocated with the EMEDS teams.  3.3.3.1.  Hazardous Cargo.  EMEDS cargo includes compressed gases and other hazardous materials.  Trained hazardous material personnel are responsible for preparing hazardous material for shipment IAW Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9-R, AFMAN 24-204_IP, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, and host nation requirements.  EMEDS commanders should ensure an adequate number of EMEDS personnel are appointed and trained as packers, handlers, inspectors, and certifying officials.    3.3.3.2.  Controlled Cargo.  EMEDS cargo includes restricted and controlled narcotics that require special control and security as prescribed by law.  A controlled medical item custodian should witness and verify the packaging of medically controlled items.  At the deployed location, controlled items must be stored in locked rooms or containers and managed IAW AFI 41-209.   3.3.3.3.  Munitions.  Units must assign primary and alternate weapons and ammunition couriers to ensure the security and accountability of small arms munitions during transit IAW AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management.  3.3.3.4.  Classified Material.  Classified material must be packaged, marked, safeguarded, and transported IAW DODM 5200.01,Volume 1, DOD Information Security Program: Overview, Classification, and Declassification, and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.  Units must assign appropriately cleared and trained couriers to accompany classified material.  3.3.3.5.  Equipment Management.  The health services administrator and medical materiel personnel should coordinate with AFFOR staff before deployment to formalize resupply and equipment repair channels.  They should track outbound equipment UTCs, and upon arrival at the bed-down location, verify that all equipment has arrived.  3.4.  Employment.  During the initial phase of employment, priorities are to establish medical C2, provide limited clinical services, perform public health and OEH assessments, and provide input into site selection.  FOC is established when the EMEDS infrastructure and clinical functions are in place.  3.4.1.  EMEDS Commander Initial Activities.  The following actions are critical to the mission’s success and should occur within the first 48 hours of arrival.  These actions are typically performed concurrently and are not listed in order of importance.  3.4.1.1.  Assess Existing Medical Capability.  Determine what level of health care and health care facilities already exist at the location.  Determine which EMEDS components, other ground medical UTCs, and AE resources are in place and the timeline for arrival of  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  27 additional support.  Determine what medical resources are available from other services and coalition forces.  3.4.1.2.  Recommend Site Location.  If necessary, find a location to house immediate clinical care (e.g., tent, building of opportunity).  In coordination with civil engineers (CEs) and BE, recommend a proposed MTF site to the Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) or Air Expeditionary Group (AEG) commander.  Consider security (central location), flight-line access, accessibility to the patient population, proximity to environmental hazards (flight-line noise, sewage plant, power and communication lines), orientation to wind and weather patterns, and terrain.  Identify areas for mass casualty triage, patient decontamination, contagious casualty management, and an alternate medical facility.  Be prepared to relocate as the base expands.  Consider alternate sites and have a relocation plan in place.  3.4.1.3.  Secure Essential Services.  Work with ECS/BOS to obtain food, water, shelter, and transportation for the medical staff.  Secure power for the medical facility.  If necessary, secure temporary refrigeration for medications, immunizations, and other medical supplies that require temperature control until the medical facility is set up.  3.4.1.4.  Establish Medical C2.  Identify the local and theater chain of command and establish contact with leadership.  Brief the AEW/AEG commander on medical assets and capability and determine the AEW/AEG commander’s expectations for health service support.  Garner support for force health protection measures to maintain the health of deployed forces.  3.4.1.5.  Determine Force Protection Condition and Security Threat.  Consult with the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), intelligence, security forces, and CE to assess the security threat and obtain information on the current force protection condition, alarm signals and responses, shelter locations and procedures, and personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements (mask, chemical gear, etc.).   3.4.1.6.  Account for Equipment and Supplies.  Ensure that supplies and equipment required to establish medical capability have arrived.  Pallets may be repacked during transit to maximize space, so packing lists on the outside of pallets may not reflect the actual contents.  Medical logistics personnel are responsible for storing and safeguarding equipment and supplies.  3.4.1.7.  Establish Communications Capability.  Identify voice and data connectivity requirements and relay needs to base communications.  Request support to establish Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) access.  3.4.1.8.  Report Arrival.  Contact the AFFOR/SG to report your arrival, current medical capability, limiting factors (LIMFACs), and shortfalls.  This should be accomplished automatically with your first situation report (SITREP).   28  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 3.4.1.9.  Establish Contact with Squadron Medical Elements (SMEs).  SMEs belong to operational squadrons but can integrate into medical operations as appropriate for mission and manning considerations.  Meet with the local flying unit commanders to determine their medical support needs and a C2 mechanism for coordinating medical services between SMEs and the deployed medical unit.  3.4.1.10.  Evaluate External Care Options.  Determine the referral pattern for patients who require a higher level of care.  Consult the AFFOR/SG’s office or U.S. Embassy for information on local medical care options and patient movement policy.  Consult the Patient Movement Requirements Center (PMRC) to clarify procedures on patient movement requests.  Determine availability and access to medical support services in the area of responsibility (AOR) (such as ancillary services, supplies) to augment services not available at the EMEDS facility.  IHS personnel can help assess local capabilities.  3.4.1.11.  Assess Need for Specialty UTCs.  The threat or mission may require support from additional specialty UTCs.  Forward recommendations and concerns to the theater AFFOR/SG.  3.4.2.  Public Health and OEH Assessments.  Upon arrival, the PAM team conducts initial public health and OEH assessments and provides input on site selection.  The public health officer and BE should participate in the Threat Working Group to ensure threats and vulnerabilities are adequately addressed and corrective actions are identified and implemented.  Once FOC is established, the PAM team is responsible for providing ongoing surveillance, including weekly and monthly disease and injury reports, entomology, and OEH site assessments (OEHSA).  3.4.3.  Reporting Requirements.  All operational reports should be submitted IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, and specific CCDR, Joint Force Commander (JFC), and COMAFFOR requirements.  After-action reports and lessons learned should be submitted IAW AFI 10-204, Participation in Joint and National Exercises, and AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned Program.  3.4.4.  Patient Movement.  Casualties are typically reported for evacuation from EMEDS to the next appropriate level of care when they are not expected to return to duty within the timeframe prescribed in the theater evacuation policy.  EMEDS patients who are transferred or evacuated are transported with their medical records, personal effects, and medically essential items.  The attending physician initiates the process to evacuate patients, and the assigned flight surgeon provides the validation for movement IAW AFI 41-307, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Considerations and Standards of Care, and AFI 11-2AEV3, Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Operations Procedures.  3.4.4.1.  Evacuation Processing.  Patient movement requests are submitted to the PMRC through the Transportation Command Regulating and Command and Control Evacuation System (TRAC2ES).  The PMRC is responsible for validating patient movement requests and for managing and coordinating the patient movement process.   AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  29 3.4.4.2.  Patient Movement Items (PMI).  PMI are the medical equipment and durable supplies required to support patients during evacuation.  When patient medical supplies and PMI are coordinated with the AE system in advance, most items can be provided from the AE staging base.  Without advance coordination, the originating facility is responsible for providing these items.  3.4.4.3.  Patient Movement Documentation.  The attending physician is responsible for ensuring that all necessary forms are completed IAW AFI 41-307.  These forms may include DD Form 602, Patient Evacuation Tag, or AF Form 3899, Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Record.  3.4.5.  Mortuary Affairs.  Should a death occur, medical personnel must coordinate with mortuary affairs IAW AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, and local procedures.   3.4.6.  Care for Enemy Prisoners of War (EPW).  If EPWs are treated at an EMEDS facility, coordinate with security forces or equivalent authority to provide armed guards for prisoners.  See AFI 31-304_IP, Enemy Prisoners of War, Retained Personnel, Civilian Internees and Other Detainees, for guidance.  3.4.7.  Care for Civilians and Non-U.S. Personnel.  If a local national is injured or becomes ill as a direct result of U.S. Government operations in the area, the theater CCDR has approval authority to allow treatment at an EMEDS facility.  Treatment is IAW State Department guidance, standardized treaties, and agreements with coalition forces.  The patient is not charged for this humanitarian service.  Any local commander may authorize the transport of a patient to the nearest suitable MTF when civilian facilities are not available.  EMEDS may be deployed to support HA/DR operations in which civilians and non-U.S. personnel are part of the supported population.  See Chapter 11 for more information.  3.4.8.  Patient Safety.  EMEDS commanders must appoint a patient safety manager to oversee the facility’s patient safety program IAW DOD 6025.13-R, Military Health System (MHS) Clinical Quality Assurance (CQA) Program Regulation, and AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations.  One of the clinical nurses typically performs this function.  The patient safety manager should complete the patient safety manager training for deployers before deployment.  All clinical and administrative personnel should be educated about the DOD patient safety program and National Patient Safety Goals (NPSG) for hospitals.  Patient safety guidelines for EMEDS facilities are available in the Air Force Deployed Patient Safety Program Guide on the AFMS Knowledge Exchange (KX) Clinical Quality Management (CQM) Patient Safety site.  3.4.9.  Documenting Patient Care.  Medical personnel must document the care provided to patients treated at an EMEDS facility IAW DODI 6490.03, Deployment Health, and AFI 41-210, Tricare Operations and Patient Administration Functions.  The Theater Medical Information Program – Air Force (TMIP-AF) provides the electronic system of record for documenting patient care and OEH exposure data.  Medical documentation created outside of TMIP-AF should be integrated into the member’s permanent health record within 30 days of return to home station.  See Chapter 5 for more information about TMIP-AF.  See Chapter 11  30  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 for more information on medical documentation for civilians and non-U.S. personnel during HA/DR operations.   3.4.10.  Maintenance and Disposition of Records.  Records associated with EMEDS operations must be maintained and disposed of IAW AFPD 33-3, Information Management, AFMAN 33-363, and AFI 33-364, Records Disposition – Procedures and Responsibilities.  Patient medical records must be managed IAW AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Program, and AFI 41-210.  Medical personnel must comply with Public Law 93-579 (as amended) Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 104-191 (as amended) Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, Freedom of Information Act, Drug Abuse and Treatment Act, and Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse amendments.  3.4.11.  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Incidents.  EMEDS may deploy with CP based on mission requirements and threat assessments.  CP-EMEDS allows medical care to continue inside the hospital for a maximum of 72 hours post exposure.  In a contaminated environment, medical care at EMEDS facilities without CP is limited to those functions that can be performed while wearing individual protective equipment (IPE).  EMEDS personnel must be familiar with the CBRN passive defense and consequence management procedures outlined in AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, and AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Environment.  FM 4-02.7/MCRP 4-11.1F/NTTP 4-02.7/AFTTP 3-42.3, Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Health Service Support in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Environment, provides guidelines on medical operations.  3.4.11.1.  Patient Decontamination.  The patient decontamination team (FFGLB) and equipment package (FFGLC) deploy with CP-EMEDS to CBRN threat environments.  The team is responsible for decontaminating patients before entry into the CP-EMEDS facility.  See AFTTP 3-42.33, Expeditionary Medical Decontamination Team, (available on the AFMS KX at https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx3/Doctrine/Pages/home.aspx) for patient decontamination procedures.  At EMEDS facilities where FFGLB and FFGLC are not employed, expedient decontamination is limited to soap and water.  3.4.11.2.  Equipment Decontamination.  Operational decontamination of equipment, ECUs, generators, and shelters depends on the contaminating agent involved and the availability of replacement equipment.  Decontamination may not be practical for some equipment (e.g., uncoated painted equipment).  3.4.12.  Contagious Casualty Management.  During a contagious disease outbreak or biological event, the EMEDS commander should work with the AEW/AEG commander to acquire additional space for housing contagious casualties.  It is imperative that contagious casualties remain isolated from the uninfected or non-contagious population.  EMEDS staff should use separate triage locations for potentially contagious patients to reduce potential exposure.  In the event of a large-scale contagious casualty incident, the EMEDS commander should contact the AFFOR/SG immediately to request additional resources to contain and manage contagious patients.  The EMEDS facility should be prepared to support a contagious  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  31 casualty incident without support from the patient movement system.  See AFTTP 3-42.22, Contagious Casualty Management, (available on the AFMS KX at https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx3/Doctrine/Pages/home.aspx) for more information.  3.5.  EMEDS Redeployment.  The EMEDS commander must actively participate in redeployment planning.  Plans for a time-phased reduction in medical services should be consistent with the deactivation of the deployed location, change in mission, or change in the threat scenario.  Normally, EMEDS personnel and equipment depart with the bulk of the AEF.  The EMEDS HRT, or a portion thereof, remains to provide emergency medical and surgical capability.  EMEDS personnel are responsible for disassembling the EMEDS infrastructure and providing loading assistance.  Medical logistics personnel are responsible for load plans and shipping manifests IAW theater and host nation requirements.  Equipment and supplies should be decontaminated IAW theater policy and applicable U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines.  Items not suitable for redeployment (such as pharmaceuticals, blood and biological waste, and sterile supplies) should be appropriately redirected within the theater or disposed of.  Most items can be redeployed.  The shipment, disposal, or storage of biological and chemical agents is at the direction of the AFFOR/SG.  32  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 Chapter 4  COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) RELATIONSHIPS  4.1.  Command and Control (C2) of Medical Teams.  To support Air Force expeditionary and global engagement requirements, Line of the Air Force (LAF) and medical leadership must ensure C2 infrastructures are in place, understood, and executable.  The chain of command for expeditionary medical units is through the LAF.  Deploying personnel should receive a chain of command briefing before deployment.  4.2.  ACC/SG Responsibility.  As the MRA, ACC/SG has overall responsibility for EMEDS tactical doctrine.  ACC/SG serves as the medical consultant for EMEDS operations, providing technical guidance and planning.  4.3.  Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) Structure.  Air Force elements deployed in an expeditionary role are designated as an AETF under the command of the COMAFFOR, as shown in Figure 4-1.  The supported COMAFFOR retains administrative control (ADCON) of assigned and attached Air Force forces IAW Air Force Doctrine Volume 1, Basic Doctrine.  EMEDS teams normally operate under the local direction of the deployed expeditionary unit commander (usually the EMEDS or AFTH commander).  See Air Force Doctrine Volume 1 and Air Force Doctrine Annex 4-02, Medical Operations, for more information on C2 structure.  Figure 4.1.  Notional AETF Structure under a Joint Task Force.  JFC COMAFFOR Special Staff (includes AFFOR/SG) A-Staff   AEW Expeditionary Medical Group Expeditionary Operations Group Provides guidance  Commands   4.3.1.  Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR).  The COMAFFOR serves as the single voice air commander to the JFC.  The COMAFFOR is responsible for all Air Force forces assigned or attached to the air component in joint or multinational operations.  The COMAFFOR employs and sustains assigned and attached Air Force forces in theater.  4.3.2.  Air Force Forces Surgeon (AFFOR/SG).  The AFFOR/SG, a corps-neutral medical service officer usually at the rank of colonel, is a member of the COMAFFOR special staff and is the director of Air Force health service operations.  The AFFOR/SG is responsible for   AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  33 overall health resources management and provides information on health surveillance, risk assessments, sustainment, and other force health protection issues. The AFFOR/SG does not exercise command authority or direct control over medical forces but provides policy, planning, coordination, and oversight to the COMAFFOR.  4.3.3.  Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW).  An AEW normally is composed of the wing command element and two or more expeditionary groups.  Figure 4-2 depicts a notional AEW structure.  The AEW commander has ADCON of all assigned AEW assets.  Medical support elements fall under the Expeditionary Medical Group (EMDG).  The EMDG commander controls fixed MTFs, EMEDS facilities, AFTHs, ATCs, and En Route Patient Staging System (ERPSS) facilities.  AE assets and SMEs fall under the Expeditionary Operations Group (EOG).   Figure 4.2.  AEW Structure.   4.3.4.  Expeditionary Medical Group (EMDG) Commander.  The EMDG commander is designated on G-series orders specifically for the deployment and is accountable to the AEW/AEG commander.  The EMDG commander is responsible for all installation medical services, including oversight and integration of non-EMEDS medics into a consolidated installation medical support and disaster response program.  The EMDG commander communicates and coordinates with the AFFOR/SG on theater medical support issues and with other joint medical units at the location.    34  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 4.4.  Joint and Multinational Operations.  C2 of medical operations in joint, multinational, or United Nations (UN) operations is often defined in the warning, execution, or operations order.  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  35 Chapter 5  COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS  5.1.  EMEDS Communications Equipment.  EMEDS communications equipment includes DOD-approved radios and computer systems.  ACC/SG determines the requirements for EMEDS IM/IT assets in partnership with ACC/A6, the TMIP-AF Program Management Office, and the Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) Manager (AFMOA/SGALW).  Responsibilities and processes for acquisition, maintenance, and configuration management of deployable IM/IT assets are outlined in the Integrated Logistics Support Plan (ILSP) for United States Air Force Medical Equipment War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT).  The CCDR is responsible for all associated upgrades and sustainment costs and for ensuring that maintenance releases are applied to the EMEDS footprint once deployed.  5.1.1.  Radios.  EMEDS equipment includes Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) compliant wideband and multiband land mobile radios (LMRs).  These radios are interoperable with existing DOD radio systems and joint networking waveforms, supporting secure voice, data, and video communication over mobile, ad-hoc internet protocol (IP) based networks.  They support line of sight (LOS) and beyond line of sight (BLOS) communications such as convoy, ambulance to airfield operations, AE and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) units, security, and local C2 networks.  Radios are allocated IAW the AS and operational specific requirements.  These assets support communications during deployment and redeployment phases and in austere environments where an established communications infrastructure may not be available.  As common user communications availability becomes available, reliance on these organic radios is reduced.  Communication planners must coordinate frequency allocation requirements through the appropriate installation, MAJCOM, or theater channels to ensure all radiating equipment is spectrum certified and frequency supportable IAW AFI 33-580, Spectrum Management.  Radio frequencies used in operations outside the United States and its territories must be approved through the appropriate theater CCDR.  5.1.2.  Computer Systems.  The ILS Manager, with support from the TMIP-AF Program Office and deploying units, is responsible for ensuring that all EMEDS communication and computer systems scheduled for deployment are current and compliant with deployed force information system naming conventions and information assurance (IA) requirements.  All hardware solutions must be consistent with published theater minimum hardware standards.  5.2.  Network Operations.  Network Operations and Security Centers (NOSCs) at the theater level are responsible for ensuring the theater’s operational and support systems remain fully capable.  EMEDS facilities rely on deployed Network Control Centers (NCCs) for core network administration, network management, and IA services at the local level.  Access to Air Force network resources and information systems is IAW AFI 33-115V1, Network Operations (NETOPS), and AFI 33-115V2, Licensing Network Users and Certifying Network Professionals.  See Attachments 17-19 for notional local area network (LAN) configurations for EMEDS HRT, EMEDS+10, and EMEDS+25.  IT systems and networks require certification and accreditation IAW AFI 33-210, Air Force Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Program (AFCAP).   36  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 5.3.  Help Desk Support.  The TMIP-AF help desk, Maxwell AFB, Gunter Annex, AL provides configuration control, technical, and help-desk support for AFMS UTCs.

Information Awareness (IA) Policy.  EMEDS personnel must understand and follow IA procedures, to include communications security (COMSEC) and computer security (COMPUSEC), IAW AFI 33-200, Information Assurance (IA) Management, AFMAN 33-282, Computer Security (COMPUSEC), and associated Air Force IA guidance.  Deploying EMEDS personnel must have current Air Force IA certification.  38  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 Chapter 6  INTEGRATION AND INTEROPERABILITY  6.1.  Integration and Interoperability with Other Systems.  Deployed medical personnel in a theater or area of operation may support elements of an AEF, components of the AE system, joint medical counterparts, Special Operations Forces (SOF) medical components, and other federal and civilian agencies.  In some instances, theater planners may request medical support for bed-down locations not associated with a typical AEF or ECS/BOS infrastructure.  6.2.  Expeditionary Combat Support/Base Operating Support (ECS/BOS) Requirements.  EMEDS assets deploy with limited organic capability and require ECS/BOS.  ECS/BOS requirements include (but are not limited to) billeting, messing and other consumable materials, power, water, ice, latrines, showers, laundry, waste management, exterior lighting, transportation (to include ambulances and general purpose vehicles), fuels, vehicle maintenance, equipment maintenance, general supplies, contracting, information and communications systems support, mortuary affairs, public affairs, chaplain, linguist, personnel and vehicle decontamination, and security.  ECS/BOS services for EMEDS facilities and personnel will be provided using the host base’s capabilities, deployable bare base systems, and contracted civilian support.  ECS/BOS requirements for HA/DR and stability operations are tailored to the mission.  See Attachment 8 for quantified estimates on required support.   6.2.1.  Civil Engineer (CE) Support.  CE support is required to assist with shelter and equipment siting, shelter setup, and to connect the EMEDS facility to the base infrastructure.  EMEDS personnel and civil engineers will install and connect electrical power utilities, ECUs, and waste and water management utility systems, as appropriate.  EMEDS facilities rely on CE forces for facility maintenance and maintenance of non-medical equipment (e.g., generators and ECUs).  Servicing and repair of non-medical equipment beyond the scope of CE’s capabilities may be contracted out.  See Attachments 9-12 for recommended EMEDS layout configurations.  6.2.2.  Billeting, Food, and Personal Hygiene Provisions.  ECS/BOS for billeting, meals, showers, and latrines for EMEDS personnel should be commensurate with that provided for all deployed personnel.  6.2.3.  Communications and Information Systems Support.  EMEDS does not deploy with the communication infrastructure needed for independent operation.  EMEDS facilities rely on the host base’s communication units for support.  EMEDS deploys with radios, STEs, and computers.  EMEDS equipment does not include telephones or cryptographic controlled items (CCI) for STEs.  6.2.4.  Equipment Movement.  Base personnel will assist with moving and positioning EMEDS equipment at the deployed location.  6.2.5.  Ice and Water.  Potable water (bottled/bulk), ice, and dry ice are normally obtained on a contract basis.  Depending on the operation, a reverse osmosis water purification unit  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  39 (ROWPU) may be deployed.  Public health and BE personnel must be involved in the procurement or in-house treatment of potable water and ice.  6.2.6. Fire Emergency Services (FES).  FES should be provided commensurate with that provided for other deployed personnel and resources.  6.2.7.  Laundry.  Laundry support is normally obtained on a contract basis but may be provided by ECS/BOS services.  6.2.8.  Oxygen.  EMEDS HRT includes mobile oxygen storage tanks (MOST), which provide a finite oxygen capability.  Medically approved oxygen and other gases may be obtained on a contract basis for EMEDS facilities without the ability to generate their own supply.  A DOGS unit is deployed at the EMEDS+10 level and above.  6.2.9.  Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL).  Fuel for vehicles, generators, and other equipment is normally obtained on a contract basis along with other base requirements.  6.2.10.  Power.  Base electrical power systems provide primary power generation.  The EMEDS commander, in consultation with biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs) or CE, ensures that power is rationed appropriately.  EMEDS+10 and above include generators, which are intended for initial operating capability and emergency backup power only.  ECS/BOS provides ground power equipment specialists to connect EMEDS power distribution panels (PDPs) to commercial or base power.  See Attachments 13-16 for recommended power grid configurations.  6.2.11.  Transportation Support.  EMEDS relies on ECS/BOS for access to vehicles for patient, personnel, and equipment movement and vehicle maintenance.  These vehicles are base transportation assets and might not be permanently assigned to the EMEDS facility.  Note:  Ambulances typically are not deployed at the EMEDS HRT level.  6.2.12.  Waste Disposal.  Medical and other waste disposal services will normally be obtained on a contract basis or will be provided as part of other base waste disposal services.   40  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 Chapter 7  SECURITY AND FORCE PROTECTION  7.1.  Security Roles and Responsibilities.  Medical personnel and equipment are non-combatant assets as defined by the Geneva Conventions and the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).  Medical personnel and WRM assemblages are protected IAW AFI 31-101.  Local security measures are outlined in the Integrated Defense Plan.  EMEDS commanders are responsible for ensuring security measures are in place to protect patients and personnel at the EMEDS facility.  Any training required for these duties (to include augmentation detail) should be requested from in-place security forces as part of pre-deployment mobility training.  EMEDS personnel are responsible for following personal protection measures outlined in AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism (AT), AOR security briefings, established force protection requirements, and other guidance.  The EMEDS commander or appointed representative should be a member of the Integrated Defense Council.  7.2.  Medical Convoy Protection.  The EMEDS commander should coordinate with the defense force commander for tactical security element (TSE) support for medical convoys outside the base perimeter and to local host-nation medical facilities.  7.3.  Operations Security (OPSEC).  EMEDS staff must protect mission-critical information (to include medical or casualty information) IAW CCDR OPSEC policy and AFI 10-701, Operations Security (OPSEC).  Classified information must be transmitted by secure means and protected IAW AFI 31-401.  SITREPs, medical surveillance, site locations, and compiled patient data are examples of information that may be classified.  7.4.  Security of Weapons and Ammunition.  EMEDS personnel may maintain issued weapons and ammunition when authorized by the EMEDS facility commander at the direction of the AEW/AEG commander.  All weapons and ammunition must be secured IAW AFI 31-101, AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual, and local procedures.  A weapons clearing barrel should be placed outside the EMEDS facility’s main entrance when threats require personnel to carry loaded weapons.  With the exception of security forces responding to a request for assistance, personnel should not be allowed to enter the EMEDS facility with a loaded weapon.  Patients’ weapons and ammunition should be transferred immediately to a member of their unit.  The EMEDS facility may temporarily store the weapons until the patient’s unit or AEW/AEG armory can accept responsibility.  Weapons should be properly cleared and secured in a locked container.  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  41 Chapter 8  TRAINING  8.1.  Medical Readiness Training Requirements.  Medical personnel assigned to EMEDS UTCs must complete individual, deployment, and unit training requirements IAW AFI 41-106.  Examples include Readiness Skills Verification Program (RSVP), CBRNE emergency preparedness and response, and clinical AFSC training.  Completion of all medical readiness training and equivalency training must be documented in the Medical Readiness Decision Support System (MRDSS).  Theater-unique training requirements will be identified in deployment reporting instructions, line remarks, or (for domestic CBRN response missions) the Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS).  8.2.  EMEDS Unit Type Code (UTC) Training.  Personnel assigned to EMEDS UTCs are required to complete EMEDS deployment training IAW AFI 41-106 and MRA guidance.  Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring that all EMEDS-assigned medical personnel receive the appropriate training.  UTC team integrity should be maintained to the maximum extent possible.  8.2.1.  Formal Training.  The EMEDS HRT formal course provides field operational training in EMEDS setup and pack out, deployed operations, equipment proficiency, and doctrine and is designed to promote team performance, cohesion, and cross-functionality.  The curriculum includes training in CP-EMEDS.  The EMEDS HRT formal course satisfies the field training requirements prescribed in AFI 41-106.   8.2.2.  UTC Sustainment Training.  UTC sustainment training occurs between formal course attendance cycles and provides team training in the skills and knowledge a UTC must possess to fulfill mission essential tasks (METs).  UTC sustainment training credit may be granted for participation in MET-driven exercises, operational readiness exercises (OREs), local exercises, and joint exercises.  Contact the ACC/SGX training branch for information on MRA-approved sustainment training exercises.  8.2.3.  Mission Essential Task Lists (METLs).  METLs are designed to help assess, measure, and report a unit’s ability to perform its mission.  Personnel assigned to an EMEDS UTC are expected to be proficient in the EMEDS Core METLs, as well as their UTC-specific METLs.  Core METLs and UTC-specific METLs are available on the ACC/SG MEFPAK Playbook.  8.3.  Joint Operations Medical Managers Course (JOMMC).  The JOMMC familiarizes and develops senior healthcare personnel to serve as JTF surgeons and staff members.  Completion of the JOMMC or equivalent course is highly recommended for EMEDS commanders and deputy commanders.  This course is offered through the Defense Medical Readiness Training Institute (DMRTI) at Ft. Sam Houston in San Antonio, TX.  8.4.  Vehicle Operation Training.  Operators of material handling equipment, ambulances, and other government motor vehicles must have a government driver’s license and appropriate  42  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 certification IAW AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations.  EMEDS facilities require multiple qualified drivers to provide 24/7 coverage.  8.5.  Weapons Training.  Weapons training requirements are outlined in AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, and AFI 41-106.  The theater CCDR may levy additional requirements, which are generally specified in the operation’s execution order (EXORD) or reporting instructions.  See the Weapons and Munitions Forecasting Table for AFMS UTCs on the AFMS Medical Readiness site for more information.  8.6.  Communications and Information Systems Training.  Specific training in the proper use of EMEDS communications and information systems is required.  See Chapter 5 for more information on EMEDS communications systems.  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  43 Chapter 9  LOGISTICS  9.1.  Expeditionary Medical Logistics (EML) System.  The EML system provides time-definite resupply of materiel by synchronizing the flow of materiel, information, and funds from initial unit request to delivery.  It links all partners in a complex supply chain (e.g., vendors, depots, carriers, third-party logisticians, and information managers).  The EML system uses a pull process for resupply and a repair-and-return process for medical equipment maintenance to minimize inventory and airlift requirements.  Within the EML system, a sustaining base is the materiel lifeline for deployed medical units.  The sustaining base augments the deployed medical unit’s limited logistical capability by assuming the bulk of the supply chain’s administrative, sourcing, and tracking functions.  The AFFOR/SG, in coordination with the Air Force Medical Logistics Operations Center (AFMLOC), determines the sustaining base.  In a mature theater, a Theater Lead Agent for Medical Materiel (TLAMM) element may be linked to the combatant commands, JTF/SG, AFFOR/SG, deployed medical units, sustaining base, and AFMLOC.  When a TLAMM is established, it becomes the deployed unit’s primary point of contact for materiel and equipment support in theater.  EMEDS relies heavily on rapid global mobility, a robust EML or Single Integrated Medical Logistics Management (SIMLM) system, and reliable reach-back communications capability.  See AFTTP 3-42.8, Expeditionary Medical Logistics (EML) System, for more information.  9.2.  Supplies and Equipment.  Initial deployments include 30 days of supplies (the initial 10-day equipment package and two resupply packages).  UTC team chiefs should coordinate subsequent resupply through the medical logistics function at the deployed location.  9.2.1.  Initial Equipment.  Table 9-1 lists the initial equipment UTCs and corresponding AS for each EMEDS increment.  The AS lists the equipment and supplies included in the equipment package.  UTC team chiefs should be aware of the contents of their equipment packages before deployment and should contact their medical logistics office for assistance with reviewing their AS.  Table 9.1.

Medical Equipment Maintenance and Repair.  BMETs provide routine maintenance and repair of medical equipment at the deployed location.  Medical equipment deemed broken beyond the medical facility’s ability to repair should be sent to the regional Medical Equipment Repair Center (MERC) or the manufacturer.  Some MERCs are designated Loan Repair & Return Centers (LRRC).  The LRRC loans some specialized equipment to augment a deployed location’s capability when equipment cannot be repaired locally.  9.4.  Equipment Upgrades and Modernization.  Changes to the EMEDS assemblage may result from technology advances and lessons learned feedback.  MRAs typically budget and plan for major equipment reviews every 3-5 years.  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  45 Chapter 10  DOMESTIC CIVIL SUPPORT  10.1.  Purpose.  This chapter covers the unique responsibilities and operational requirements of EMEDS UTCs allocated to support DSCA operations under the National Response Framework (NRF).  10.2.  Mission.  The Commander, United States Northern Command (CDRUSNORTHCOM) and the Commander, United States Pacific Command (CDRUSPACOM) assist civil authorities in responding to significant or catastrophic disasters or emergencies within the domestic portion of their respective AORs when directed by the President or Secretary of Defense.  Note:  United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) provides domestic civil support for Hawaii and Pacific territories.  Operational instructions and command relationships are defined in the EXORD.  10.2.1.  Natural Disasters and Emergencies.  Upon direction by higher headquarters, EMEDS components will deploy to support DSCA operations following a national disaster or emergency.  The primary mission is to provide rapid, initial medical response and help restore vital medical services.  EMEDS assists the medical relief efforts of domestic civilian relief agencies.  The military’s role in these operations is intended to be limited in scope and duration.  The typical mission duration for EMEDS personnel is less than 30 days.  While the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of Homeland Security is the lead in domestic response, DOD military personnel operate under a military chain of command.  C2 typically resides under a joint force command structure where the EMEDS commander reports through a line chain of command or through the joint force surgeon.  Specific C2 of medical operations is defined in the WARNORD, EXORD, or OPORD.  See JP 3-28, Defense Support of Civil Authorities, and JP 4-02 for more information on health service support in joint civil support operations.  10.2.2.  CBRN Response.  The DOD provides domestic CBRN response (a specialized form of DSCA) through the CBRN Response Enterprise.  The CBRN Response Enterprise is a dedicated, scalable military CBRN response capability that consists of state and federal military response forces, as shown in Figure 10-1.  Federal military response forces consist of the Defense CBRN Response Force (DCRF) and Command and Control CBRN Response Elements (C2CRE A and B) and are allocated to United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM).  EMEDS UTCs allocated to the mission support the DCRF.  Additional medical support for the C2CREs is handled through a request for forces process.  The federal military response uses graduated CBRN response posture levels (CRPLs) to maintain response capabilities at an alert posture commensurate with a credible threat or in anticipation of potential required deployment.  USNORTHCOM oversees planning and management of the CBRN Response Enterprise’s DOD components in conjunction with the National Guard Bureau (NGB), USPACOM, United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), and other service branches.  See the USNORTHCOM Concept Plan (CONPLAN) 3500, Civil Support, for more information and CRPL timelines.   46  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 Figure 10.1.  CBRN Response Enterprise.

Command Relationships.  Upon arrival in the operations area, EMEDS personnel allocated to the CBRN Response Enterprise are under the OPCON of the joint forces commander appointed by CDRUSNORTHCOM or CDRUSPACOM.  The COMAFFOR retains ADCON over EMEDS personnel through the AEW/AEG commander.  10.2.2.2.  Training.  USNORTHCOM, USPACOM, and NGB jointly oversee the CBRN Response Enterprise training program.  DCRF and C2CRE training, exercises, and evaluations are conducted IAW the Joint Mission Essential Tasks (JMETs) and Joint Mission Essential Task List (JMETLs).  The DCRF and C2CRE conduct confirmatory exercises annually and participate in select FEMA regional exercises.  Joint training plans, schedules, and training records are maintained in the Joint Training Management Information System (JTIMS).  10.3.  EMEDS Operations.

Specific UTCs are identified in the TPFDD.  10.3.1.  ECS/BOS Requirements.  EMEDS deploys with limited organic capability and requires ECS/BOS.  See Chapter 6 for more information.  Historically, Air Force ground medical support for domestic civil support missions has been built on an augmented EMEDS+10 or EMEDS+25 platform.  See Attachment 8 for baseline ECS/BOS requirements.  10.3.2.  Medical Reports and Communication.  All medical reports should be submitted IAW AFI 10-206 and specific guidance from the CCDR and JFC.  10.3.3.  Patient Movement.  All categories of DOD and American citizen patients (routine, urgent, priority, and contingency) requiring patient movement by fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft during CONUS DR operations will be reported to the appropriate PMRC.   10.3.4.  Medical Logistics Support.  A SIMLM designated by the CCDR provides the medical logistics support for DSCA operations.  The SIMLM relies on a TLAMM to obtain and distribute Class VIII medical materiel.  If the TLAMM is not fully operational, does not stock the required items, or the sustainment supply chain is disrupted, medical logisticians may reach back to the sustaining base.  A DOD activity address code (DODAAC) is required to submit resupply requirements and create delivery and billing addresses.  See JP 4-02 and AFTTP 3-42.8 for more information on the EML system and Chapter 9 for more information on EMEDS logistics support.  48  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 Chapter 11  HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND DISASTER RELIEF (HA/DR) OPERATIONS  11.1.  Purpose.  This chapter details the planning factors, operational considerations, and other factors unique to EMEDS foreign HA/DR operations.  11.2.  Mission.  Upon direction by higher headquarters, EMEDS and associated ECS/BOS components will deploy to support foreign HA/DR operations.  The primary mission is to provide rapid, initial medical response and help restore vital medical services.  EMEDS augments the medical relief efforts of partner nations, intergovernmental agencies, and civilian relief agencies.  The military’s role in these operations is intended to be limited in scope and duration.  The typical mission duration for EMEDS personnel is less than 30 days.  Figure 11-1 shows a notional EMEDS response timeline.  Figure 11.1.  Notional EMEDS Response.  11.3.  Operational Assumptions.  EMEDS response is based on the following assumptions about the operational environment:    Civilian authorities are in control of their government and the operational environment.    U.S. forces are not responsible for host nation patient movement, including rotary wing or ground evacuation.   EMEDS may be deployed in austere conditions with limited logistical support.  ECS/BOS will be required if EMEDS is not collocated with ECS/BOS components at the airhead/runway.   U.S. forces will be self-billeted.      AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  49   Food, potable water, electrical power, and fuel may not be locally available.  U.S. forces will bring their own capability.  If applicable, the host nation has airfield control, and the runway will be available to U.S. forces.   Material handling equipment (MHE) is not available.   Transportation from the airhead to the site (if not collocated) is not available in theater.   Local communication systems are not available within the area of operations.  The operating site will require communications setup and maintenance support.   A Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) or appropriate diplomatic notes will exist.         Humanitarian Assistance Survey Teams (HAST), IHS, and Defense Institute for Medical Operations (DIMO) resources may be employed.   11.4.  Medical Planning Factors.  The supported population may include U.S. and partner nation forces, personnel from governmental agencies and non-government organizations (NGOs), and local nationals.  Medical rules of engagement (ROE) should define the scope and level of care, types of patients who will be treated, plans for moving stabilized patients to the next level of care, patient referral policies, and other medical considerations.  JP 3-29, Foreign Humanitarian Assistance, and JP 4-02 provide joint planning guidance.  11.4.1.  Interorganizational Coordination.  Participants may include U.S. and coalition military forces; U.S., state, or host nation government agencies; multinational partners; and private sector relief organizations.  EMEDS personnel should understand the key organizations involved and their interrelationships, roles, and responsibilities, as well as formal coordination requirements, ROE, and reporting instructions.  11.4.2.  Humanitarian Assistance Survey Team (HAST) Participation.  The JFC may deploy a HAST to assess the situation and determine the appropriate response.  The HAST should include a medical representative.  An IHS representative from the regional health specialist team (FFHSR) may be tasked with this role.  See AFI 44-162 for more information on IHS employment.  11.4.3.  Cultural and Language Considerations.  Cultural and language barriers may be an issue in providing medical triage and care.  Medical providers may have limited access to effective interpreters.  MAJCOMs and Component Numbered Air Forces (CNAFs) should consider basic language and cultural orientation for the medical staff before deployment.   11.4.4.  Public Affairs Guidance.  EMEDS commanders should be provided with public affairs guidance on theater and CCDR strategic themes and messages before departure from home station, if possible.  All assigned personnel should follow active public affairs guidance.  Communication on EMEDS capabilities should be realistic and specific.  For  50  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 example, the AFMS is not organized, trained, equipped, or mobilized to treat medical conditions that require extended hospitalization or prolonged nursing care.  11.4.5.  Patient Care Documentation and Records Disposition.  Patient care documentation requirements for non-U.S. personnel (e.g., NGO personnel, partner nation forces) treated at an EMEDS facility is IAW State Department guidance, standardized treaties, and partner nation agreements.  Patient care documentation and records disposition requirements for local nationals should be negotiated with the host nation.  This documentation is typically paper-based so it can be shared with the host nation.  11.4.6.  World Health Organization (WHO) Materiel.  The EMEDS AS is designed to provide care for a predominately healthy active duty population and may not be appropriate for the host nation patient population.  Providers should ensure that treatment options can be sustained locally.  In emergent situations where there is no time to identify the regional availability of standard medications and supplies, medics and planners can use the WHO’s recommended Essential Medicines List and Interagency Emergency Health Kit for guidance.  11.4.7.  ECS/BOS Requirements.  ECS/BOS requirements depend on operational conditions and mission directives.  ECS/BOS requirements typically include airfield operations, security forces, CE, power production, transportation, and logistics support.  The U.S. military is responsible for EMEDS site security and the protection of EMEDS personnel and equipment on and off site.  A host nation may provide security augmentation or impose limitations on security operations outside the EMEDS area, as determined by agreements between the host nation and U.S. forces.  Additional ECS/BOS requirements may include political advisory, judge advocate, civil affairs, linguist, and chaplain support.  Attachment 8 provides the baseline ECS/BOS support requirements for EMEDS facilities.  11.5.  Command Relationships.  The State Department or the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance (OFDA) within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the U.S. government lead in foreign response.  DOD military personnel operate under a military chain of command regardless of the lead agency.  C2 typically resides under a joint force command structure where the EMEDS commander reports through a line chain of command or through the joint force surgeon.  Specific C2 of medical operations is defined in the WARNORD, EXORD, or OPORD.  11.6.  Standard of Care.  Medics should apply U.S. medical standards when treating American forces.  The medical ROE define the scope of care and triage guidelines for host nation patients based on the situation, other available health support capabilities, patient movement capabilities, and the host nation’s request for support.  Medical interventions typically are limited to procedures and therapies that are low risk, can be performed quickly, require limited follow-up, and do not undermine the host nation medical system.  11.7.  Patient Movement.  EMEDS may be employed with an ERPSS facility that can facilitate the intra-country movement of host nation patients.  Due to Secretarial Designee status requirements, OCONUS host nation patients are not typically entered into the AE system for movement outside their nation.    AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014  51 11.8.  Interoperability with Host Nation and Partner Providers.  Healthcare professionals and volunteers from the host nation or other partner may assist EMEDS personnel in providing health support if they meet mutually agreed upon requirements for proof of credentials.  11.9.  Blood Supply.  Blood products are generally used for the direct support of military forces supporting the mission.  EMEDS facilities should use DOD sourced or DOD collected blood products.  If supply or resupply is not available from DOD sources, consult the AJBPO for direction.  Blood policies for host nation patients should be IAW the medical ROE.   11.10.  Property Donation.  Serviceable medical equipment and supplies (Class VIII A medical materiel) may be made available to the host nation or NGOs IAW CCDR policy and direction.  Property donations typically require coordination with logistics personnel, public affairs, legal, and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Requests for property should be forwarded to the DOD for approval and funding authorization.  Transfer and distribution of the property is the responsibility of the State Department IAW Title 10 United States Code (USC), Section 2557.  Donated equipment or materiel should be appropriate and interoperable with host nation standards, maintainable by host nation capabilities and resources, and have a measurable positive impact on host nation health capacity.

EMEDS HRT Transition.  The EMEDS HRT transition primarily involves improvements to the existing manpower and equipment packaging.  FFHR1 consolidates the EMEDS Basic equipment UTCs: FFEE1, EMEDS Equipment, and FFEE8, Expanded Capability and Infrastructure Module (ECIM).  EMEDS HRT features a new quick-erect shelter system, new weather-proof storage containers, and a more efficient pack out system.  It includes one additional tent for a total of five tents.  This change was driven by a validated need for more space to accommodate logistics functions and the additional personnel.  Existing specialty care UTCs were tailored to create a new specialty care module that provides internal medicine, OB/GYN, and pediatric care.  Pharmacy and radiology manning from EMEDS+10 were shifted to EMEDS HRT and IHS support was added.  A strategic review of all EMEDS UTCs is planned for fiscal year (FY) 2014.  During this review, the entire capability will be reviewed and modernized.  A20.2.  Equipment Migration.  The equipment migration is budgeted to start in FY 2012 with estimated completion in FY 2015.  An initial 10 EMEDS HRT equipment packages are funded for FY 2012.  Funding for the remaining equipment packages is in the outlying years.  Based on analysis of readiness requirements and risk assessments, the AFMS decided to reduce the overall inventory from 42 sets to 36 starting in 2012.  Table A20-1 shows the migration timeline.  Table A20.1.  Inventory Migration Timeline.  Fiscal Year FFEE1/FFEE8 Inventory FFHR1 Inventory Inventory Migration Timeline 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 42 26 26 13 0 0 10 10 23 36  A20.3.  Open Issues.  The following are known issues associated with the migration.    No CP infrastructure is available for the Utilis quick-erect shelters purchased for FFHR1.  EMEDS HRT will deploy with FFEE1 and FFEE8 (which include the Alaska small shelter system) and EMEDS Basic CP equipment if CP is needed.   With 10 FFHR1 equipment packages in the initial inventory through FY 2013, continued use of the EMEDS Basic equipment package may be required.    The EMEDS Basic equipment package has only four tents.  Space will be an issue if the specialty care team needs to deploy to this setting.    88  AFTTP3-42.71  27 AUGUST 2014 A20.4.  Alternate Configuration.  Setup and configuration of the Alaska small shelter system can add up to 12 hours to the EMEDS FOC timelines, as shown in Table A20-2.  Figure A20-1 shows the recommended layout for an EMEDS four-tent configuration using the EMEDS Basic equipment package.  Figures A20-2 through A20-3 show the recommended configuration for EMEDS+10 and EMEDS+25 facilities built on an EMEDS Basic foundation.  Table A20.2.
