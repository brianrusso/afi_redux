Basic Authority 1.1.1.  The term ‘Coronet’ denotes movement of air assets (Air Force Doctrine Document 1-02,  Air  Force  Glossary).    For  the  purpose  of  this  instruction,  Coronet  identifies  aircraft movements that are operating under ACC AOS Movement Control (MOCON), and typically have  a  transoceanic  leg,  transit  the  Mediterranean  Sea,  or  transit  between  Alaska  and CONUS.    ACC  AOS  exercises  MOCON  for  all  ACC  AOS  Coronet  missions  as  defined  in section 1.3. 1.1.2.  The  ACC  AOS  communicates  directly  with  major  commands  (MAJCOMs),  other services,  Department  of  State,  embassies,  and  foreign  governments  to  move  aircraft  in accordance  with  (IAW)  this  instruction.   If  foreign  governments  or  international organizations  are  involved,  refer  to  AFMAN  16-101,  International  Affairs  and  Security Assistance Management. 1.1.3.  Wavier Authority.  Unless otherwise directed in this AFI, the waiver authority for the contents of this instruction is  HQ ACC/A3.   Night  landings must be approved by  aircraft’s parent MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent (ANG: NGB/A3).  Waiver authority for the 14-day pre-transoceanic  flight  requirement  is  the  aircraft’s  owning  operations  group  commander (OG/CC) or equivalent (See Attachment 2). 1.1.3.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk. 1.1.3.1.1.  “Tier  0”    (T-0)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance is determined and waived by respective non-Air Force authority. 1.1.3.1.2.  “Tier  1”    (T-1)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance  may  put  airman,  mission,  or  program  strongly  at  risk,  and  may  only  be waived  by  the  MAJCOM/CC  or  delegate  with  concurrence  of  publication  approver.  When multiple MAJCOMs are affected, then T-1 is appropriate. 1.1.3.1.3.  “Tier 2”  (T-2) requirements are reserved for requirements that potentially put the mission at risk or potentially degrade the mission or program, and may only be waived by the MAJCOM/CC or delegate. 1.1.3.1.4.  “Tier  3”    (T-3)  requirements  are  reserved  for  requirements  that  non-compliance has a remote risk of mission failure, and may be waived by the Wing/CC but no lower than the OG/CC. 1.2.  Request for Support. 1.2.1.  All Coronet requests should be submitted to the ACC AOS no later than the end of the 3rd week of each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul and Oct) to schedule services in the following quarter.  Organizations requesting Coronet support will send requests to ACC AOS (see  Attachment 3).  (T-2)    Units  must  provide  mission  details  (e.  g.  dates,  itinerary,  and  number/type  of receivers).    Once  the  initial  request  has  been  submitted,  changes  to  these  mission  details could jeopardize tanker/mission support.   6  AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015 1.2.1.1.  Units  requesting  dual  role  support  (i.e.  units  requesting  cargo  movement  on tankers  supporting  the  movement  of  combat  aircraft)  must  submit  their  requests  using Joint  Operations  Planning  and  Execution  System  (JOPES)  (for  Contingency  and  JCS Sponsored Exercises) or as a special assignment airlift mission (SAAM) request  (for all other mission types).  SAAM requests have significant lead time requirements and must be submitted IAW AMCI 11-206, Mobility Force Management.  See note in Attachment 3. (T-2) 1.2.2.  Foreign governments requesting Coronet support must have either: an authorized and funded USAF or USN Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case or an authorized Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA)/Implementing Arrangement (IA).  ACC AOS is unable to  begin  planning  for  a  foreign  government’s  Coronet  request  until  ACC/IAS  and AMC/FMFFS  have  verified  the  FMS  Case/ACSA/IA  can  be  used.    For  ACSAs/IAs, ACC/IAS  will  coordinate  with  ACC/A4RXP  and  AMC/FMFFS  will  coordinate  with USTRANSCOM/JA/J3. 1.2.2.1.  When  foreign  governments  request  services  though  a  USAF  FMS  case, ACC/IAS  will  verify  the  case  has  a  line  that  provides  reimbursement  to  ACC  AOS  for fighter planning and execution of aircraft ferry support services.  If tanker/airlift support is  required  AMC/FMFFS  will  verify  the  case  has  a  line  to  reimburse  AMC  for  their support. 1.2.2.2.  When  foreign  governments  request  services  though  ACSA/IAs,  ACC/A4RXP will  be  responsible  for  executing  the  IA  for  ACC  AOS  services.    ACC/IAS  will  advise A4RXP  on  amounts   AMC/FMFFS  will  coordinate  with USTRANSCOM/JA/J3 when an ACSA/IA is to be used for tanker support. to  be  charged. 1.2.2.3.  Authorized use of USN FMS case funds must be coordinated with an appropriate USN line manager or OPR. 1.3.  Scope of Control. 1.3.1.  MOCON is the authority to initiate and terminate flights and direct or vary itineraries while enroute.  ACC AOS exercises MOCON for all ACC AOS Coronet missions.  The ACC AOS exercises MOCON of aircrews from 24 hours before the first scheduled takeoff through landing  at  the  final  destination.    ACC  AOS  exercises  MOCON  of  aircraft  from  takeoff through landing at final destination.  Aircrews require ACC AOS approval prior to leaving a mission  when  the  aircraft  have  not  been  delivered  to  their  final  scheduled  destination (NOTE: The ACC AOS exercises MOCON of Air Force Reserve and ANG aircrew members only when they are in  active status under Title 10 of the United States Code to execute the Coronet, but no earlier than 24 hours before the first scheduled takeoff.) 1.3.1.1.  Air spares remain under the ACC AOS MOCON from takeoff until first landing. 1.3.1.2.  For Air Force Reserve and ANG aircrew.  The ACC AOS exercises MOCON of aircrews when they  enter Title 10 status to  execute the mission, but  will start  no earlier than 24 hours before the first scheduled takeoff through landing at the final destination. 1.3.2.  If a unit desires to assume MOCON of aircraft from the ACC AOS prior to delivery to their  final  scheduled  destination,  the  unit  must  provide  a  written/e-mail  acceptance  of MOCON signed by the unit’s OG/CC or equivalent (Attachment 4). (T-2) AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015   7  Chapter 2 AIR MOBILITY COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  618  AOC  (TACC).  618  AOC  (TACC)  is  responsible  for  tanker  support  for  all  Coronet missions. 2.2.  Tanker  Escort  Requirements.  Tankers  are  required  to  escort  receivers  on  transoceanic legs until  receivers  can  maintain two-way  radio  communications with  air traffic control (ATC) and navigate to  their destination or divert  base.  For mid-ocean rendezvous, tankers will escort receivers until the receivers have confirmed two-way radio communications and either positive radar or visual contact with joining tankers. 2.3.  Fighter  Aircraft  Monitor  (FAM).  In  the  event  that  a  FAM  is  on  board  an  escorting tanker, 618 AOC (TACC) will ensure coordination for the availability of equipment (e.g. headset and microphone) to enable the FAM to communicate with escorted fighters. 2.4.  Search  and  Rescue  (SAR).  In the event of a downed or ditched receiver, the lead tanker will  coordinate  with  ATC,  618  AOC  (TACC),  etc.  to  notify  the  nearest  SAR  assets.    Tankers should  provide  cover  as  long  as  fuel  reserves  allow,  while  remaining  receivers  proceed  to  the nearest  acceptable  divert  base  (unescorted,  if  necessary)  or  continue  the  mission  with  the remaining tankers.  618 AOC (TACC) will be prepared to coordinate initial SAR efforts and then assist appropriate personnel recovery efforts. 2.5.  Extended  Operations  (ETOPS).  If an ETOPS fuel  requirement is specified in  the ATO, 618  AOC  (TACC)  will  ensure  the  ETOPS  fuel  and  tanker  escort  is  available  to  support  an engine-out fighter divert. 2.6.  Co-located  Departures.  When  the  receiver  aircraft  and  tankers  are  co-located  at  an airfield, 618 AOC (TACC) will ensure an additional 1,000 lbs of fuel per receiver is available on the first air refueling to account for fuel burned during initial rendezvous.  Otherwise, 618 AOC (TACC) should expect that the tankers will need to take off before the fighters.   8  AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 3 ACC AOS RESPONSIBILITIES 3.1.  ACC  AOS  Coordination.  The  ACC  AOS  will  coordinate  specific  Coronet  requirements with  deploying  units,  provide  refueling  requirements  to  618  AOC  (TACC),  coordinate diplomatic clearances for DoD registered Combat Air Forces (CAF) aircraft, coordinate altitude reservations  (ALTRV),  produce  Controlling  Mission  Weather  Products  (CMWP),  file  the  CAF aircraft  flight  plan,  control  Coronet  launches,  monitor  enroute  and  divert  airfield  weather,  and track the status of all Coronet aircraft. (T-2) 3.2.  Delivery Control Officers (DCOs) Responsibilities.  DCOs will: 3.2.1.  Create,  validate,  and  submit  flight  plan  to  the  appropriate  Air  Traffic  Service  (ATS) agencies including appropriate DOD Base Operations Offices.  DCOs, in  coordination with the  Flight  Lead/PIC  have  the  authority  to  file,  amend,  or  cancel  flight  plans.    DCOs  shall ensure  individual  ATC  addresses  are  included  for  all  Operational  Air  Traffic  (OAT) segments. (T-2) 3.2.2.  Brief  and  provide  aircrews  with  a  flight  plan,  route  overview,  missed  refueling  base (MRB) plan, air refueling plan, any applicable ALTRV, and other details required to safely execute the mission. (T-2) 3.2.3.  Be responsible for making a launch “Go” decision.  The DCO will ensure appropriate coordination with the ACC AOS Mission Control Center (MCC), flight leads, and 618 AOC (TACC) representatives. (T-2) 3.2.3.1.  The DCO, flight leads, tanker aircraft commander (AC) and 618 AOC (TACC) representatives can make a “No-Go” decision.  However, a “No-Go” decision will not be made until two hours prior to the no later than takeoff time for the fighters without prior coordination  with  ACC  AOS/CC  (or  designated  representative)  and  618  AOC/XOZ (Senior). 3.2.4.  Maintain an accurate accounting of all primary and spare aircrew/aircraft. 3.3.  DCO Training and Stan/Eval.  The ACC AOS will maintain a DCO training program and the  ACC  AOS/CC  or  designated  representative  will  ensure  the  periodic  assessment  of  DCOs executing a Coronet mission. (T-2) AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015   9  Chapter 4 DEPLOYING UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES 4.1.  Administrative  Control.  Unit  commanders  retain  administrative  control  of  their  aircraft and aircrews during Coronet movements. 4.2.  Assuming  MOCON.  If a unit desires to assume MOCON of aircraft from  the ACC AOS prior  to  delivery  to  their  final  scheduled  destination,  the  unit  must  provide  a  written/e-mail acceptance of MOCON signed by the unit’s OG/CC or equivalent (see Attachment 4). (T-2) 4.3.  Aircrew  Leaving  Missions.  Aircrews  require  ACC  AOS  approval  prior  to  leaving  a mission when the aircraft have not been delivered to their final scheduled destination. 4.4.  Range  Orientation/Familiarization.  Units  desiring  to  perform  a  range  orientation  / familiarization  enroute  to  an  exercise  such  as  RED  FLAG,  must  pre-coordinate  for  the  proper assumption  of  MOCON  and  specify  the  point  at  which  MOCON  will  be  assumed  by  the  unit.  No additional tanker assets will be provided for the range orientation and the unit is responsible for coordinating all range requirements. (T-2) 4.5.  DUAL Role and ESTA Request.  Requests to move cargo and passengers (DUAL ROLE and/or  ESTA)  will  be  submitted  by  the  deploying  unit  through  established  logistics/MAJCOM validator  channels.    Units  will  submit  their  requests  using  JOPES  (for  Contingency  and  JCS Sponsored Exercises) or as a SAAM request (for all other mission types).  SAAM requests have significant  lead  time  requirements  and  must  be  submitted  IAW  AMCI  11-206.    See  note  in Attachment 3.  Units should reference their Coronet mission number on all requests. (T-2) 4.6.  Crew Rest and Aircrew fatigue. 4.6.1.  Crew rest  and flight  duty period  (FDP) limitations for USAF aircrews  are  IAW AFI 11-202,  Volume  3,  General  Flight  Rules.    Other  Services  and  foreign  air  forces  will  use applicable directives if more restrictive than guidance below. 4.6.1.1.  All aircrew must be afforded the opportunity for at least 8 hours of continuous, uninterrupted rest during the 12 hours immediately prior to the mission show time. 4.6.1.2.  FDP  calculations  will  assume  at  least  an  additional  20  minutes  for  arrival  and ground operations prior to engine shutdown. 4.6.2.  Units  should  consider  the  effects  of  jet  lag  and  the  stresses  of  flights  longer  than  8 hours.  Units should consider coordinating for a flight surgeon to brief aircrew on the stresses involved in extended flights and discuss how diet, fluid intake, rest, sedatives/stimulants, and alcohol can affect fatigue and jet lag. 4.6.3.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  deploying  unit  to  coordinate  and  obtain  permission  for sedative/stimulant use. 4.7.  Aircraft  configuration.  Units  will  configure  aircraft  with  the  maximum  number  of external  fuel  tanks  consistent  with  safe  and  efficient  MRB  planning  and  operational requirements.  Do not add items to the configuration to reduce airlift requirements.  Immediately coordinate any changes to aircraft configurations specified in the Air Tasking Order (ATO) with   10  AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015 ACC AOS.  Changes may require a new flight profile and could change tanker requirements that could jeopardize tanker/mission support. (T-2) 4.7.1.  Deployments  are  normally  conducted under peacetime rules and procedures, without carriage of live ordnance, expendables (i.e. chaff/flares), or a hot/armed gun.  Units require ACC/A3  approval  to  carry  these  stores  on  Coronet  missions.    A  request  to  carry  live ordnance should consider the following: 4.7.1.1.  Political considerations/sensitivities. 4.7.1.2.  Increased lead time for diplomatic clearances. 4.7.1.3.  Security, safety, and storage considerations. 4.7.1.4.  Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Munitions personnel requirements 4.7.1.5.  Increased tanker requirements due to increased gross weights/reduced fuel loads and higher drag indices. 4.7.1.6.  Utilization of civilian airfields for MRBs. 4.7.1.7.  Complications for maintenance actions on divert/broken aircraft. 4.8.  Aircraft Equipment. 4.8.1.  Equip aircraft IAW published directives and the ATO.  Ensure necessary  navigation, communication, and air refueling systems are operational. 4.8.2.  Ensure all inspections will remain current through delivery. (T-2) 4.8.3.  Units will equip aircrews with  aircrew flight  equipment  (AFE) according to  AFI 11-202, Volume 3 or equivalent. (T-2) 4.8.4.  Each  aircraft  should  be  flown  within  14  days  of  a  transoceanic  leg  in  the  planned Coronet  fuel  configuration  to  ensure  applicable  aircraft  systems  and  equipment  work properly. 4.9.  Aircrew Requirements. 4.9.1.  Aircrews under ACC AOS MOCON must be at least Basic Mission Capable (BMC) and qualified in  air refueling operations IAW AFI 11-2 MDS-specific volumes, ATP-56(B) Air to Air Refueling, or similar directives for the USN, USMC, etc.  (T-2) 4.9.1.1.  Training  is  prohibited  on  Coronet  movements  unless  specifically  approved  by the ACC AOS/CC.  Do not expect approval of training which increases fuel requirements or decreases the probability of a successful/on-time movement. 4.9.2.  Units  should  schedule  pilots  with  the  following  qualifications  to  increase  odds  of  a successful launch: 4.9.2.1.  Two-ship formation:  one two-ship fight lead (or equivalent). 4.9.2.2.  Three-ship  formation:    one  four-ship  and  one  two-ship  flight  lead  (or equivalent). 4.9.2.3.  Four-ship formation:  two four-ship flight leads (or equivalent). AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015   11  4.9.2.4.  Five  or  six-ship  formations:    two  four-ship  and  one  two-ship  fight  lead  (or equivalent). 4.9.3.  The  deploying  unit  must  provide  documentation  identifying  aircrew  selection  and qualifications NLT 14 days prior to scheduled departure.  Acceptable documentation can be either  a  Letter  of  X’s  or  aircrew  qualification  letter  (see  Attachment  5)  signed  by  an authorized official.  If an aircrew substitution is required, any additional travel costs are the responsibility of the deploying unit. (T-2) 4.9.4.  Foreign Clearance Guide Requirements.  DOD aircrews flying into foreign countries must review and comply with the applicable portions of both the classified and unclassified portions of the FCG concerning personnel diplomatic clearance requirements such as NATO orders,  passport,  visa,  ID,  uniform,  customs  and  immigration,  force  protection,  ancillary training,  and  immunization  requirements.    Non-DOD  aircrews  (e.g.  Foreign,  contract,  etc.) are required to obtain their own personnel and aircraft diplomatic clearances. (T-2) 4.9.5.  TDY/Flight  authorizations.    Units  will  publish  aircrew  TDY  orders  and  flight authorizations.    TDY  orders  will  include  any  special  statements  required  by  the  Foreign Clearance  Guide  (FCG).    (Note:  All  ANG  personnel  supporting  combat  aircraft  deliveries outside the United States must deploy in Title 10 status). (T-2) 4.10.  Mission Planning Considerations. 4.10.1.  Units  under  ACC  AOS  MOCON  will  operate  IAW  the  applicable  flight  manuals, instructions,  and  limits  specified  by  the  MAJCOM  or  its  equivalent,  whichever  is  more restrictive. (T-2) 4.10.1.1.  Units  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  any  weather  requirements that are more restrictive than AFI 11-202 Vol. 3 and AFI 11-207, and should provide the DCO with those requirements. (T-2) 4.10.2.  Inflight  refueling for air spare(s) is  not  planned  and the flight  profile may preclude air spare recovery at home station. 4.10.3.  Tail hook equipped aircraft planning to land at a destination or use an MRB with less than  8,000  feet  of  runway  and  without  a  compatible  arresting  system,  require  specific approval  of  the  OG/CC  or  equivalent.    For  ANG,  approval  is  the  air  operations  officer, OG/CC or higher. 4.10.4.  Night Landings: ACC AOS mission are normally planned to arrive at least one hour prior  to  sunset.    Units  desiring  to  land  at  night  due  to  operational  factors  such  as  circadian rhythm  disruption  should  seek  approval  by  MAJCOM/A3  or  equivalent  (ANG:  NGB/A3).  Approvals  should  be  requested  early  in  the  planning  process  to  avoid  departure  timing changes that could jeopardize tanker/mission support. 4.10.5.  Fighter Aircraft Monitors (FAMs):  When flying on an escorting tanker, FAMs (after coordination with 618 AOC (TACC)) must report to the tanker departure base and attend the mission briefing.  FAMs will contact  the DCO  for briefings on mission aspects  and launch decisions.  FAMs must carry appropriate aircraft flight manuals and checklists, and they will wear appropriate flight clothing when reporting for duty.  618 AOC (TACC) will ensure the availability of equipment (e.g. headset and microphone) to enable the FAM to communicate with escorted fighters. (T-2)   12  AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015 4.10.6.  Single-Ship Transoceanic flights:  Require approval by MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent (ANG: NGB/A3).  If approved, a Fighter Aircraft Monitor (FAM) qualified IAW paragraph 4.10.5 must be onboard the tanker unless the single-ship aircraft is a multi-seat aircraft with at least two qualified aircrew onboard. (T-2) 4.11.  Flight Lead/Aircraft Commander Responsibilities.  The flight lead/aircraft commander ensures the proper conduct of aircrews on ACC AOS missions: 4.11.1.  Ensures aircrews have all the appropriate Flight Information Publications (FLIP) for the entire mission and are familiar with instrument approach procedures for their destination, alternates,  and  all  planned  MRB.    DOD  units  are  responsible  for  obtaining  approval  to  fly non-DOD approaches. 4.11.2.  Briefs aircrews on any items pertaining to the mission that were not covered by the DCO. 4.11.3.  Ensures missions are flown as briefed by the DCO and contacts the Mission Control Center to relay departure/arrival times and aircraft status. 4.11.4.  Ensures all aircrews have proper life support equipment and coordinates storage for life support and classified equipment at each enroute stop. 4.11.5.  Ensures  all  documents  required  by  customs,  agriculture,  immigration,  or  military authority are completed. 4.11.6.

Land  single-ship  to  a  full  stop  from  an  instrument  approach  or  VFR  traffic pattern. 4.11.9.3.  Do not land in formation except in an emergency. 4.11.10.  Aircraft Divert and Abort Procedures 4.11.10.1.  Diverts:  I  f  the  landing  occurs  outside  of  U.S.  controlled  areas,  aircrews should request assistance from the nearest military attaché or diplomatic representative. 4.11.10.2.  Aborts 4.11.10.2.1.  Ground  Aborts:  Single  aircraft  ground  aborts  must  be  approved  by  the DCO in coordination with the MCC.  The decision will be based on several factors to include follow-on tanker availability, unit requirements, follow on transoceanic legs, etc.  Consideration will be given to delaying the entire mission. 4.11.10.2.2.  Air  Aborts:  Flight  leads  must  consider  single-ship  Coronet  restrictions for  transoceanic  legs  when  making  any  decisions  regarding  a  single-ship  air  abort.    AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015   13  NOTE:  Flight demonstrations, maneuvers, events or fly-bys are prohibited on ACC AOS moves. 4.12.  Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. 4.12.1.  In the event of a downed or ditched receiver, the lead tanker will coordinate with Air Traffic  Control,  618  AOC  (TACC),  etc  to  notify  the  nearest  SAR  assets.    Tankers  will provide cover as long as fuel reserves allow, while remaining receivers proceed to the nearest acceptable divert base (unescorted, if necessary) or continue the mission with the remaining tankers. 4.13.  Enroute Maintenance Support. 4.13.1.  Aircrews will notify the MCC of all maintenance issues and aircraft status changes. (T-2) 4.13.2.  Units will coordinate plans for any FCF/confidence flights with the DCO. 4.13.3.  The parent  MAJCOM, or equivalent,  funds all logistic expenses. IAW AFI 65-601, Volume  1  the  MAJCOM,  or  equivalent,  provides  the  maintenance  personnel,  equipment, supplies, and transportation required to repair the aircraft.  Transient aircraft maintenance and documentation  procedures  outlined  in  T.O.  00-20-5,  Aerospace  Vehicle  Inspection  and Documentation,  will  be  adhered  to  at  all  times.    Owning  units  are  encouraged  to  solicit maintenance  support  from  the  nearest  location.              NOTE:  When  FMS  aircraft  need maintenance enroute, aircrew will notify the MCC, who will advise the Security Assistance Program Manager (SAPM). 4.13.4.  If  local  weather,  host  nation  restrictions  and  mission  schedule  permits,  aircraft experiencing an enroute delay should be flown within 14 days of the next transoceanic leg.   14  AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 5 PLANNING AND EXECUTION 5.1.  Planning and Execution Criteria. 5.1.1.  ACC  AOS  missions  are  planned  and  executed  according  to  the  criteria  outlined  in Table 5.1. Table 5.1.  Planning and Execution Criteria.   Maximum Receivers  Standard Planning Launch Decision Criteria Criteria NOTES 6 per tanker 6 per tanker Landing                                        (Without Night Landing approval)   After Sunrise  Before Sunset NLT 15 minutes prior to EECT Cell Intervals Destination Fuel Reserves 30 minutes  ≥ 15 minutes  60 minutes   ≥ 55 minutes (OCONUS) ≥ 40 minutes (CONUS)   1, 3 1, 2 1, 4 1, 4 1, 4 40 minutes MRB Fuel Reserves Destination Alternate Fuel Reserves NOTES: 1.  ACC  AOS/CC  (or  designated  representative)  must  approve  any  deviation  less than  the  standard  planning  criteria,  but  no  less  than  the  launch  decision minimums.  ≥ 20 minutes 20 minutes  ≥ 35 minutes 2.  The  DCO,  Flight  Lead,  and  Tanker  Mission  Commanders  must  agree  to  any cell  interval  less  than  25  minutes.  ALTRV  restrictions,  onboard  sensor capabilities (Radar, TCAS, etc), Coronet complexity, inter-cell communications capability,  and  weather  must  be  considered  for  any  cell  spacing  less  than  30 minutes.  3.  EECT = End of Evening Civil Twilight   4.  Fuel reserves calculations will be based on maximum endurance performance at 10,000 feet  MSL.  These calculations do not  include fuel  for  an approach and missed approach at the destination. (see paragraph 6.3.2)  5.1.2.  When  the  receiver  aircraft  and  tankers  are  co-located  at  an  airfield,  receiver  aircraft will  normally  take  off  first  if  weather  and  airspace  permit.    Additionally,  the  tanker  must have the required extra tanker fuel available to support a rendezvous.  (See paragraph 2.6). 5.1.3.  When  a  tanker  accompanies  the  flight  to  a  destination  the  tanker  should  land  last  if conditions permit. AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015   15  5.2.  Launch Decisions.  The DCO is responsible for making a launch “Go” decision.  The DCO will ensure appropriate coordination with the ACC AOS Mission Control Center (MCC), flight leads, and 618 AOC (TACC) representatives. (T-2) 5.3.  Aircrew Briefings.  All aircrew departing on a Coronet mission must receive a Mission and Final  briefing.    These  briefings  are  normally  done  face-to-face  by  the  DCO.    The  mission briefing is normally presented the day before mission launch but may be accomplished prior to the final briefing on launch day if agreed to by deploying unit. 5.3.1.  Mission  Briefing:    Provides  aircrews  with  ACC  AOS  guidelines  governing  Coronet missions  as  well  as  mission  details  for  the  leg  to  be  flown.    Aircrews  unable  to  attend  the briefing will be required to receive it before flying on a Coronet mission. 5.3.2.  Final  Briefing:    The  Final  Briefing  provides  updates  and  covers  any  last  minute mission  changes.    It  is  normally  given  two  hours,  but  will  start  no  less  that  1+30  hours, before launch.   16  AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 6 WEATHER CRITERIA FOR ACC AOS MOVES 6.1.  DCO Compliance.  DCO will ensure compliance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3 and AFI 11-207 weather requirements or any more restrictive guidance provided by the unit. (T-2) 6.2.  Alternate  Required.  A  destination  alternate  is  required  for  all  ACC  AOS  missions, regardless  of  forecast  weather.    Exception:  For  remote  or  island  destinations,  the  weather forecast  must  be  equal  to  or  better  than  the  weather  requirements  for  an  alternate  airfield.  Consider  an  airfield  to  be  a  remote  or  island  destination  when  its  unique  geographic  location offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within two (2) hours flying time.  (Example: Lajes is not typically an island destination since other airfields are within two hours flying time). 6.3.  Weather Minimums. 6.3.1.  Takeoff Minimums are the most restrictive of the following: 6.3.1.1.  Lowest compatible published approach/landing minimums for departure base. 6.3.1.2.  The  most  restrictive  pilot  weather  (PWC)  category  in  the  flight,  or  IAW  with applicable service directives. 6.3.2.  Destination Filing Minimums.  Except for TEMPO conditions for thunderstorms and snow/rain showers, the worst forecasted prevailing weather conditions for an airport (ETA ±1 hour) must meet or exceed: 6.3.2.1.  CIG/VIS 500 feet and 1 ½ SM or lowest compatible published approach/landing minimums whichever is greater. 6.3.2.2.  The most restrictive PWC in the flight. 6.3.2.3.  For remote or island destinations - CIG/VIS 1,000 feet and 2 miles, or 500 feet and  1  mile  above  the  lowest  compatible  published  approach/landing  minimums, whichever  is  greater.    Exceptions  for  TEMPO  conditions  do  not  apply.  (Reference paragraph 6.2) 6.3.3.  Destination Alternate Minimums.  Except for TEMPO conditions for thunderstorms and  snow/rain  showers,  the  worst  forecasted  prevailing  weather  conditions  for  an  alternate airport (ETA ±1 hour) must meet or exceed: 6.3.3.1.  With  a  Compatible  Published  Instrument  Approach  Procedure:  A  ceiling  of  at least 500 ft. above the lowest compatible approach/landing minima and a visibility of at least 2 SM or published visibility minima whichever is greater. 6.3.3.2.  Without  a  Published  or  Compatible  Instrument  Approach  Procedure.    Forecast weather  for  the  ETA  (±1  hour)  must  permit  a  VFR  descent  from  the  Minimum  IFR Altitude (MIA) to a VFR approach and landing. 6.3.3.3.  If  radar  is  required  for  the  only  suitable  approach  at  the  alternate,  weather requirements  at  the  alternate  are  the  same  as  for  an  alternate  without  a  published approach procedure. AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015   17  6.3.3.4.  The  TEMPO  condition  for  thunderstorms  and  snow/rain  showers  is  no  lower than  the  most  restrictive  of  the  following:  (CIG/VIS)  500ft  and  1  ½  SM,  the  most restrictive PWC, or the lowest compatible published landing minimums. 6.3.4.  Missed  Refueling  Base  (MRB)  Minimums.  Except  for  TEMPO  conditions  for thunderstorms and snow/rain showers, the worst forecasted prevailing weather conditions for an MRB (ETA ±1 hour) must meet or exceed: 6.3.4.1.  Cloud ceiling and visibility (CIG/VIS) must be at least 1,000 feet and 2 miles, or 500 feet and 1 mile above the lowest compatible published landing minimums, whichever is greater. 6.3.4.2.  Without a published landing minimum, forecast weather for the ETA (±1 hour) must permit a VFR descent from the MIA to a VFR approach and landing. 6.3.4.3.  The  TEMPO  conditions  for  thunderstorms  and  snow/rain  showers  is  no  lower than  the  most  restrictive  of  the  following:  (CIG/VIS)  500ft  and  1  ½  miles,  the  most restrictive PWC, or the lowest compatible published landing minimums. 6.4.  Runway  Condition  Reading  (RCR).  Runway  Condition  Reading  (RCR)  limits  are  IAW MDS/MAJCOM or equivalent guidance. 6.5.  Crosswind Limits.  Runway crosswind limitations are IAW MDS/MAJCOM or equivalent guidance. 6.6.  Wind  and  Sea  State  Restrictions.  Normal  Wind  and  Sea  State  Restrictions  for  Ejection Seat Aircraft do not apply to ACC AOS missions.  However, forecast Wind and Sea State should still be considered when making launch decisions.   18  AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 7 FOREIGN MILITARY SALES DELIVERIES 7.1.  Non-DOD  customers.  Non-DOD  customers  (e.g.  Foreign,  contract,  etc.)  must  obtain diplomatic  clearances  for  their  personnel  and  aircraft  through  their  appropriate  channels.  Foreign  customers  must  also  request  U.S.  aircraft  landing  authorization  numbers  (ALAN)  for their  aircraft  through  their  embassy  using  US  Department  of  State’s  Diplomatic  Clearance Application System (DCAS). (T-2) 7.2.  Foreign Aircrew Observer.  Foreign aircrew observer participation in US/DOD registered aircraft must follow the  guidance in  AFMAN 16-101 and requires ACC/A3 approval.    Foreign governments  must  request  permission  for  their  foreign  aircrew  observer  participation  on  ACC AOS  ferry  flights  through  SAF/IA  then  to  ACC  AOS/CC.   Submit  these requests  to  SAF/IA  a minimum of 60 days before the departure date and include information on the pilots as indicated in Attachment 6. (T-2) 7.3.  Aircrews  flying  DOD  registered  aircraft.  Aircrews  flying  DOD  registered  aircraft  with unique  avionics  configurations  require  familiarization  training  prior  to  the  first  delivery  flight.  USAF acceptance pilots familiar with the avionics configuration will determine the appropriate training requirements and will work closely with the ACC AOS to task only the most qualified pilots (similar block and engines, etc.) for FMS deliveries. (T-2) 7.4.  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS).  For  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  missions,  the agency/organization  with  ownership  of  the  aircraft  is  responsible  for  requesting  any  waivers required for their specific FMS move and will provide them to  the ACC AOS no later than 14 days  before  the  launch.    If  aircrews  are  from  a  different  agency/organization,  applicable  unit leadership (OG/CC or equivalent) should coordinate on any waiver requests. (T-2) AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015   19  Chapter 8 FUNDING AND ACCOUNTING 8.1.  Funding  and  Accounting.  Funding  responsibilities  are  IAW  AFI  65-601,  Volume  I, Budget  Guidance  and  Procedures.    Flying  time  is  reported  IAW  AFI  21-103,  Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting. 8.1.1.  DCO travel expenses are the responsibility of the deploying unit or the Tasking HHQ.  Tasked  unit/HHQ  will  provide  the  DCO  a  fund  cite  letter  or  Cross-Organization  Funding (DTS: “Cross Org LOA”) authorization NLT 14 days prior to mission launch.  Also send this fund cite information by message/E-mail/Fax to the ACC AOS/RA. (T-2) 8.1.2.  PDM/Aircraft  Transfers:    DCO  and  aircrew  funding  instructions  will  be  included  in the ATO.  Aircrews will forward a copy of their completed travel voucher to ACC AOS/RA (Resource Advisor) within 10 days of receipt of payment. (T-2) 8.1.3.

An  ATO  is directive in nature. Controlling  Mission  Execution  Forecast  (CMEF)—The  time-phased  route  weather  forecast issued  by  ACC  AOS/AOSW  for  all  Coronet  missions.    This  controlled  forecast  is  the  official forecast for all aircraft involved. Coronet—Movement of air assets, usually fighter aircraft, in support of contingencies, rotations, exercises, or aircraft movements for logistics purposes. (AFDD 1-2) Detail Planner—A TACC-assigned detail mission planner (AMC counterpart to the ACC AOS DCO)  who  coordinates  with  all  other  tanker  planning  agencies,  ensures  all  supporting  tankers have  required  mission  material,  adequate  tanker  supervision,  and  support  at  all  enroute  staging bases. Fighter  Aircraft  Monitor  (FAM)—An  aircrew  member  who  provides  emergency  assistance and  advice  to  the  receiver  crews.    The  FAM  must  be  qualified  in  the  type  of  aircraft  being moved. Foreign Military Sales—(Working this with AOS/XP) Missed  Refueling  Base  (MRB)—A  base  selected  for  recovery  of  an  aircraft  in  case  an  air refueling is missed or unsuccessful. Minimum  IFR  Altitude  (MIA)—The  lowest  safe  altitude  permitted  to  be  flown  under  IFR.  Normally, this is the lowest published IFR altitude (i.e. MEA, MOCA, OROCA, or ORTCA) for a given area, not including any portion of an IAP. Reference AFI 11-202 Vol 3 para 8.13. Movement Control (MOCON)—The authority to initiate and terminate flights and to direct or vary  itineraries  while  enroute.    MOCON  does  not  imply  the  assumption  of  operational  control (OPCON) or administrative control (ADCON). Transoceanic—A  flight  is  considered  transoceanic  if  it  crosses  a  body  of  water  that  extends beyond the ATC communication or navigation capabilities of the fighter/attack aircraft.  AFI11-207  31 MARCH 2015   23  Attachment 2 DETERMINING WHEN APPROVAL AUTHORITY CHANGES  A2.1.  The following guidance is  intended to  provide clarification for the appropriate source of waivers/approvals when units are enroute to/from a deployment. A2.2.  The command that is responsible for the aircraft (not the aircrew) is the determinant factor for deciding the appropriate waiver/approval authority. A2.3.  Owning/Home  Station  commands  retain  waiver/approval  authorities  when  units  are moved  (vs.  deployed)  for  exercise  purposes  where  only  TACON  is  gained.    Additionally, transient  forces  do  not  usually  come  under  the  authority  of  a  CCDR  solely  by  their  movement across operational area boundaries, unless otherwise directed by appropriate authority. A2.4.  MAJCOM/A3  Level  Waiver/Approvals: station MAJCOM/A3 will be the authority  for MAJCOM/A3 level  waivers/approvals  until  the aircraft lands  within  the  deployed  AOR.    The  home  station  MAJCOM/A3  resumes  authority  for waivers/approvals for the first leg that departs the deployed AOR, unless otherwise directed by the deployment order.   An  aircraft's  owning/home A2.5.  WG/OG  Waiver/Approval  Levels:    An  aircraft’s  owning/home  station  will  be  the authority for WG/OG level waivers/approvals until the aircraft arrive at the final destination of the  deployment.    The  aircraft’s  owning/home  station  regains  authority  for  WG/OG  level waivers/approvals  for  the  first  leg  of  the  redeployment  from  the  deployed  location,  unless otherwise directed by the deployment order.
