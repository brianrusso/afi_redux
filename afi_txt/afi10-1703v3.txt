CMR  requirements  may  apply  to  additional  personnel  at  selected  units  at  the direction of AF Space Command (AFSPC)/A3. (T-2)   Major  Commands (MAJCOMs)/Numbered  Air Forces 1.3.  Supplements. (NAF)/Wings/Groups/Squadrons  may  supplement  this  instruction  to  provide  specific guidance  to  their  aligned  units  in  accordance  with  AFI  33-360.  The  Headquarters  AF Directorates  of  Cyberspace  Operations  and  Warfighting  Integration  (A3C/A6C)  and Cyberspace Strategy and Policy (AF/A6S) will review and coordinate on all supplements to this  instruction.  Air  Reserve  Components  (ARC)  will  provide  a  copy  of  any  approved supplement to AF/A3C/A6C, AF/A6S, and AFSPC/A3. 1.4.  Real-Time Operations & Innovation (RTOI). RTOI projects are operational rather than acquisition-related  activities.  The  RTOI  construct  enables  the  USAF  to  generate  tools  and tactics in response to critical cyber needs at the fastest possible pace. 1.4.1.  RTOI  activities  are  specifically  intended  to  satisfy  urgent  and  short-term operational needs in response to: 1.4.1.1.  Cyber Incidents/Events Category 0 thru 9, as outlined in the Chairman of the Joint  Chief  of  Staff  (CJCS)  Instruction  6510.01F,  Information  Assurance  (IA)  and Support  to  Computer Network Defense (CND), and CJCS Manual  6510.01B, Cyber Incident Handling Program. Emergent threats and opportunities as determined by 24 AF/CC. 1.4.1.2.  Newly  discovered  critical  vulnerabilities  not  currently  mitigated  within  the Air Force Enterprise network or capable of remediation by other means. 1.4.1.3.  Critical cyberspace operational needs (both defensive and offensive), which 24  AF/CC  has  been  tasked  to  fulfill  or  which  have  been  identified  through  the conduct of daily operations. 1.4.2.  RTOI  complements  the  traditional  acquisition  framework,  providing  responsive technical solutions to urgent cyber needs which cannot be fulfilled by Rapid Acquisition (RA) or  Foundational Acquisition methods.  It  is  not  intended to  circumvent  normalized operational  and  acquisition  processes  through  informal  relationships  among  the  United States  Cyber  Command,  the  Armed  Forces,  the  National  Security  Agency,  and  the Defense  Information  Services  Agency.    HQ  AFSPC  will  develop  specific  policy  for quick-reaction processes otherwise available for the rapid fielding of capabilities. (T-2) 1.5.  Crew  Responsibility.  In  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives,  this  instruction prescribes operations procedures for cyberspace weapons systems under most circumstances, but it is not a substitute for sound judgment or common sense, . As a general rule, except as noted in paragraph 3.5.1. or in guidance that states an action “must” or “shall” be carried out, AFI10-1703V3  6 MAY 2015   3  operations or procedures not specifically addressed in this instruction may be accomplished if they  enhance  safe,  effective  mission  accomplishment  and  are  approved  for  execution  by appropriate command authorities. 1.6.  Waivers.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  AFSPC/A3I  is  the  waiver  authority  for  this instruction; this authority may be delegated to the wing commander level within AFSPC, but no lower. 1.6.1.  Waiver requests which must be approved by HQ AFSPC/A3I will be appropriately classified and submitted in memo or message format to the 24 AF Operations Directorate (24  AF/A3/5)  via  channels  appropriate  to  the  level  of  classification;  classified  requests should  be  submitted  to  24af.a3@lackland.af.smil.mil,  with  copies  to  HQ  AFSPC/A3I (afspc.a3i.wf@afspc.af.smil.mil)  and  HQ  USAF/A3C/A6C  (usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6c-a3c-workflow@mail.mil).  24AF/A3/5  will recommend  approval  or disapproval;  approved  waiver  requests  will  be  forwarded  to  AFSPC/A3I  for  final approval.  Each waiver request will include, at a minimum, the following information: 1.6.1.1.  The specific requirement to which the waiver request responds. 1.6.1.2.  Full justification/rationale for the waiver request. 1.6.1.3.  The proposed waiver expiration date/time. 1.6.2.  Approved waivers are valid for a maximum of one year from the effective date. 1.6.3.  ARC  units  will  forward  waiver  requests  which  cannot  be  granted  at  the  wing commander  level  through  command  channels  to  the  applicable  MAJCOM  Operations Division (e.g., ANG/A3C or AFRC/A3), for approval. Approved waivers are valid for a maximum  of one  year from the effective date.  Provide information  copies of approved waivers to AF/A3C/A6C, AFSPC/A3, and the ARC MAJCOM OPRs. 1.7.  Changes  and  Clarifications.    The  HQ  AF  Director  of  Cyberspace  Strategy  and  Policy (AF/A6S) has overall authority for administration of this instruction. through 1.7.1.  Recommend changes to this publication using AF Form 847. Coordinate and route AF  Forms  847 to  AFSPC/A3I, afspc.a3i.workflow@us.af.mil,  which  will  forward  approved  change  proposals  to AF/A6SS,  1480  Air  Force  Pentagon,  Washington,  DC,  20330-1480  (or  via  electronic message usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.a6s-workflow@mail.mil), for final review and approval. the  unit’s  chain  of  command to AF/A6S Workflow, 1.7.2.  Process  requests  for  clarification  via  memorandum  or  message  to  AFSPC/A3I through 24  AF/A3/5,  24af.a3@us.af.mil. 24 AF  will provide the NAF position prior to forwarding. 1.7.2.1.  If a clarification request was initiated by telephone, the submitting unit will follow up in writing within one working day. (T-3) 1.7.2.2.  AFSPC/A3I  will  route  the  response  back  to  the  requestor  through  24 AF/A3/5.     4  AFI10-1703V3  6 MAY 2015 2.  Mission Planning. 2.1.  Responsibility. Individual crews, unit operations, and intelligence functions jointly share responsibility for mission planning. The crew commander/senior crew member is ultimately responsible  for  all  aspects  of  mission  planning  to  include  complying  with  command guidance.  Unit  commanders  may  establish  weapon  system  specific  mission  planning requirements but  will ensure an appropriate level of mission planning is  conducted prior to each mission. (T-1) 2.2.  Procedures.  Effective mission accomplishment requires thorough mission planning and preparation. Failures in execution often result from poor mission preparation, therefore units will  conduct  thorough  planning  prior  to  every  mission.  General  mission  planning considerations  are addressed in  AFTTP  3-1, General  Planning,  and CWO specific planning consideration  can  be  found  in  AFTTP  3-1,  Cyber  Warfare  Operations,  or  other  weapon system  specific  AFTTP  3-1  volumes.  While  not  directive,  these  manuals  are  useful  in ensuring adequate mission planning and employment. (T-1) 2.2.1.  Units  will  accomplish  sufficient  planning to  ensure  successful  mission accomplishment  for  all  phases  of  operations.  The  mission  commander/senior  crew member  will  use  the  Plan-Brief-Execute-Debrief  (PBED)  process  for  mission  planning. At  a  minimum,  mission  planning  will  include  mission  objectives,  expected  threats (identity  and  counter-tactics),  weapons  delivery,  cancel/abort/rollback  criteria  and/or contingency  plans,  Rules  of  Engagement  (ROE),  Risk  Management  (RM),  lessons learned and applicable Special Instructions (SPINS). (T-2) 2.2.2.  Unit  staff  will  provide  crews  sufficient  time  and  resources  to  accomplish  crew mission  planning  and  mission  briefing.  Mission  planning  must  be  accomplished  by members  who  understand  the  capabilities  and  limitations  of  their  weapon  system,  in  a realistic  training  and/or  mission  rehearsal  environment.  Unit  staff  will  ensure  other activities, such as recurring academic training, training device periods, additional duties, etc., do not  interfere with time allotted for mission planning and crew mission  briefing. The  crew  commander/senior  crew  member  is  ultimately  responsible  for  the  proper conduct of mission planning and must ensure sufficient time and materials are available to effectively plan the mission. (T-2) 2.2.3.  Crew  substitutions  require  approval  by  unit  operations  officer  or  higher.  Crew substitutions  may  be  made  as  long  as  the  substitute  crewmember  is  thoroughly  briefed and understands all aspects of the mission. (T-3) 2.3.  Crew  Mission  Planning.  Detailed  crew  mission  planning  helps  ensure  mission objectives are understood by all crew members and an effective plan is developed to achieve those objectives. In preparation for and prior to each sortie, crews will take tactical objectives provided  by  higher  headquarters  organizations  through  tasking  orders  and  create  tactical tasks for execution in the next sortie. 2.3.1.  All  crew  members  must  be  present  during  shift  change  or  sortie  briefing  unless specifically  excused  by  the  squadron  operations  officer  or  higher  authority.  The  crew commander/senior  crew  member  will  direct  detailed  mission  planning,  including procedures  to  employ.  Crew  commander/senior  crew  member  will  review  all  crew  and crewmember  training  requirements  and  currency  data  to  the  maximum  extent  possible; AFI10-1703V3  6 MAY 2015   5  review  crew  and  weapon  system  restrictions  for  each  activity  planned  and  plan  an alternate  mission/activity  in  the  event  equipment  failure  prevents  accomplishing  the primary mission. (T-3) 2.3.2.  The  crew  commander/senior  crew  member  is  ultimately  responsible  for  ensuring the  adequacy  and  completeness  of  all  mission  data  and  resources  and  must  make  risk determinations  to  cancel  or  abort  missions.  The  crew  commander/senior  crew  member must ensure crew substitutions are  made in time for the substitute crewmember(s) to be thoroughly briefed and familiar with the applicable mission data available and to rehearse with the rest of the crew in realistic range/training facilities, as required. (T-2) 2.4.  Weapons and Tactics. Weapons and Tactics personnel will support the employment of current/effective  TTPs, the  planning/briefing/execution/debriefing  of  missions,  and development of lessons learned. (T-2) 2.5.  Intelligence  and  Threat  Study.  During  mission  planning,  crews  will  receive  a  current intelligence briefing which will include detailed briefings on current adversary activity, threat type and capabilities. Crews will also review applicable TTPs and implement in accordance with mission requirements. (T-2) 3.  Normal Operations. 3.1.  Crew Logs. The crew log is the official record of events that occur during a crew shift or sortie  (live  or  simulated).  The  purpose  of  the  log  is  to  maintain  an  accurate  and  detailed record  of  all  significant  events,  including  any  deviations  from  guidance  in  this  Instruction pertaining to operations occurring during each crew shift. Of primary importance are events that  may  result  in  subsequent  investigations.  At  a  minimum,  crew  logs  will  include identification of on-duty personnel, major operational activities, significant communications, major system degradations and other abnormal system responses. Maintain crew logs for one year to provide historical reference for mission operations. (T-3) 3.2.  Crew Information File (CIF). The CIF provides information essential to the conduct of normal  operations  and  response  to  emergency  conditions.  The  CIF  centralizes  significant, time-sensitive  issues  and  ensures  procedures  are  disseminated  to  operations  personnel.  All crew  members  are  required  to  review  the  CIF  and  acknowledge  completion  prior  to beginning  crew  duties.  Refer  to  AFI  10-1703,  Volume  1,  Cybercrew  Training,  for information on the structure and content of the CIF. (T-3) 3.3.  Crew Shift/Mission Briefing. A successful mission briefing covers objectives tasked by higher  headquarters,  assigns  tactical  tasks  to  achieve  those  objectives,  and  ensures  all  crew members understand the plan. 3.3.1.  The  crew  commander/senior  crew  member  will  conduct  a  crew  mission  briefing and rehearsals as necessary for all missions. When rehearsals confirm mission feasibility, the  responsible  commander  approves  the  mission  plan  and  authorizes  execution.  Crews will practice, mission plan and modify operational details according to rehearsal results. (T-3) 3.3.2.  A  crew  member  excused  from  the  mission  briefing,  or  substituted  following  the briefing, must receive a detailed briefing from the crew commander/senior crew member   6  AFI10-1703V3  6 MAY 2015 and  be  afforded  an  opportunity  to  rehearse  his/her  role  with  other  crewmembers,  as required. (T-3) 3.4.  Shift/Mission  Debriefing.  The  crew  commander/senior  crew  member  will  lead  a thorough mission debrief for every mission. The mission debrief will cover the following at a minimum: whether tasks and objectives were met, lessons learned, and learning points. (T-3) 3.5.  Checklists, Local Procedures, and Crew Aids. 3.5.1.  Crew  members  will  strictly  adhere  to  all  checklists  in  a  technical  order  (TO),  all unit generated checklists or other higher headquarters (HHQ) directives. (T-2) 3.5.2.  24 AF/A3 will generate guidance to cover actions not addressed in a TO or other directives. (T-2) 3.5.3.  Units may develop local procedures specific to their mission when operations fall outside existing TOs and HHQ guidance. Local procedures will not be used to re-create or consolidate existing technical data or HHQ guidance. (T-3) 3.5.4.  Crew members may develop local crew aids such as charts, question banks, guides or  other  visual  aids  and  processes  to  bolster  proficiency,  enhance  changeover  briefings and to ensure comprehensive tasks are completed correctly.  However, these aids will not override  or  be  used  in  lieu  of  TOs  and  other  directives.  The  squadron  commander  will review  and  recommend  approval/disapproval  of  all  locally  developed  crew  aids.  Local crew aids will be approved by the Group commander or his/her designee. (T-3) 3.5.5.  Briefing  Guides.  Units  will  develop  local  briefing  guides  to  ensure  all  necessary items  are  covered  prior  to  each  mission.  Group-level  Stan/Eval,  or  designated  stan/eval entity, will determine minimum requirements for these guides and ensure standardization. (T-3) 3.5.5.1.  Guides will contain procedural guidance addressing mission accomplishment with abnormal/degraded/inoperative equipment. (T-3) 3.5.5.2.  Guides will contain other information deemed necessary by individual units, i.e., local training procedures, and procedures for notifying maintenance personnel of equipment discrepancies. (T-3) 4.  Operational  Tests  and  Exercises.  Exercising,  testing  and  evaluating  the  crew  force  is necessary  to  maintain  proficiency;  however,  exercises  and  tests  also  provide  important  data needed to validate the operation of the weapon system. (T-3) 4.1.  During  an  exercise  or  test,  crewmembers  will  and  follow  established  operating procedures, AFIs, and governing publications with the understanding that exercise and tests are  an  avenue  to  try  new  TTPs  and  capabilities.  RM  should  be  performed  at  all  levels  to mitigate any risk. (T-3) 4.2.  Exercises and tests will not jeopardize real-world missions. Real-world emergencies or priorities  may  require  a  crew test  or  exercise.  The  crew commander/senior  crew  member  will  coordinate  with  the  unit  commander  or  operations officer  and  all  other  participating  agencies  to  cancel,  postpone  or  withdraw  from  a  test  or exercise.  (T-3)  When  priority  actions  are  complete,  the  crew  may  be  permitted  to  resume participation as approved by appropriate authorities. to  withdraw  from  a AFI10-1703V3  6 MAY 2015   7  5.  Crew Force Management. 5.1.  Crew  Rest,  Fatigue  Management  and  Duty  Limitations.  This  section  prescribes mandatory  crew  rest  and  maximum  duty  periods  (DP)  for  all  personnel  who  operate  AF cyberspace  weapon  systems.  Basic  guidance  for  fatigue  management  strategies  and  waiver authority procedures are also addressed. (T-3) 5.1.1.  The normal crew DP should not exceed 12 hours. (T-3) the commander, the authorized  by appropriate  group 5.1.2.  When crew commander/senior  crew  member  may  extend  the  maximum  DP  up  to  two  hours  to compensate for unplanned mission delays, provided the mission requirements justify the increased  risk.  Extended  DP  must  be  annotated  in  the  mission  log,  at  a  minimum detailing  authorizing  official  (i.e.,  group  commander  or  designated  representative)  and crew members affected. Mission or environmental needs requiring longer than a 14 hour DP require wing commander approval (may be delegated to OG/CC or equivalent). (T-3) 5.1.3.  Regardless  of  authorized  DP,  the  crew  commander/senior  crew  member  will restrict  duty  time,  extend  crew  rest  periods,  notify  squadron  leadership  to  generate alternate crews, or terminate a mission if safety may be compromised by fatigue factors. (T-3) 5.1.4.  DP  begins  when  a  crew  member  reports  for  a  mission/sortie,  briefing,  or  other official duty and ends with the completion of the mission debrief. (T-3) 5.1.5.  The  crew  rest  period  is  a  10-hour  non-duty  period  before  the  DP  begins.  Its purpose  is  to  ensure  the  crew  member  is  adequately  rested  before  performing  a cyberspace  mission  or  mission-related  duties.  Crew  rest  is  free  time,  and  includes  time for meals, transportation and the opportunity for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. (T-3) 5.1.6.  Crew rest is compulsory for any crew member prior to performing any crew duty on any cyber weapon system. (T-3) 5.1.7.  Each  crew  member  is  individually  responsible  to  ensure  he  or  she  obtains sufficient rest during crew rest periods. (T-3) 5.1.8.  Any  official  business  or  duty  that  requires  the  active  participation  of  a  crew member,  not  during  the  DP,  interrupts  the  crew  rest  period.  This  includes  official business conducted via telephone or other electronic means. If crew rest is interrupted so that  the  individual  cannot  get  an  opportunity  for  at  least  eight  hours  of  uninterrupted sleep,  the  individual  must  be  afforded  the  opportunity  for  at  least  eight  more  hours  of uninterrupted  sleep  plus  reasonable  time  to  dress,  eat,  travel,  etc.  Intentional  crew  rest interruptions  shall  only  be  made  under  the  most  exceptional  circumstances.  The individual must consider unofficial interruptions so that the intent of this section is met. If crew rest is interrupted, individuals will inform a supervisor and remove themselves from the mission schedule, when necessary. (T-3) 5.1.9.  Exceptions to the 10-Hour Minimum Crew Rest Period. For continuous operations when  basic  crew  DPs  are  greater  than  12  but  less  than  14  hours,  subsequent  crew  rest may be reduced proportionally to a minimum of 10 hours to maintain a 24-hour work/rest schedule. (T-3)   8  AFI10-1703V3  6 MAY 2015 5.1.10.  Continuous operations is defined as two or more consecutive DPs of at least 12 hours duration separated by minimum crew rest. (T-3) 5.1.11.  The 10-hour crew rest exception shall only be used to keep crews in 24hour clock cycles, not for scheduling convenience and will not be sustained for more than 72 hours. (T-3) 5.1.12.  Any  reduction  from  10  hours  crew  rest  requires  pre-coordination  for transportation,  meals  and  quarters  as  necessary  so  crewmembers  are  provided  an opportunity for at least eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. (T-3) 5.1.13.  Crew  members  will  not  perform  cyberspace  mission  duties  within  12  hours  of consuming alcohol or other intoxicating substances, or while impaired by its after effects. (T-3) 5.2.  Crew Scheduling. Crew scheduling will be accomplished in  accordance with crew rest limitations provided in this guidance. (T-3) 5.2.1.  Maintain crew integrity to the maximum extent possible. 5.2.2.  Units  should  attempt  to  provide  all  crewmembers  a  stable  schedule  using  a standard rotation for 24/7 crews to the maximum extent possible. 5.2.3.  Operations  Scheduling.  Operations  schedulers  will  publish,  post  and  monitor schedules  for  the  crew  force  and  initiate  changes  to  the  schedules  based  on  tracking  of qualifications,  certifications,  restrictions  and  other  factors  as  required  to  meet  mission objectives. (T-3) 5.2.3.1.  Operations  schedulers  will  make  schedule  change  notifications  within  24 hours  for  changes  that  take  effect  within  the  next  72  hours.  Make  notifications  as soon as practical  after the change is  official, but  not  later than 12 hours prior to  the scheduled event time. (T-3) 6.  Operations  Review  Board  (ORB).  MAJCOMs/NAFs  will  establish  an  ORB  process  for conducting  investigations  to  determine  the  cause  of  any  mission  failures  or  significant  events, including  abnormal  system  responses  or  trends.  If  the  initial  analysis  reveals  the  incident  is outside the purview of the affected Wing, then the parent MAJCOM may request ORB support from  HQ  AFSPC.  In  cases  where  the  responsible  organization  does  not  have  the  required expertise,  the  MAJCOM  can  request  that  expertise  through  HQ  AFSPC.  Exceptions  can  be worked  on  a  case  by  case  basis  through  MAJCOM  to  MAJCOM  interaction,  with  appropriate support from all interested parties. Examples of circumstances requiring an ORB include: Major system  degradation,  indications  of  erroneous  system  response/procedures  with  significant mission  impact  and  significant  events  where  the  cause  cannot  be  determined  by  initial assessment or when corrective action is beyond minimal retraining or minor procedural changes. A  significant,  abnormal  system  response  may  include  major  hardware  or  software  anomalies, safety violations, or security deficiencies.  TOD D.

(JP 6-0) Sortie.—  A  cyber  sortie  (combat  or  training)  constitutes  the  actions  an  individual  cyberspace force package takes to  accomplish a tasked mission.  The base unit for a sortie is a cyberspace force package.  A cyberspace force package completes a single sortie when it comes “off station” or the tactical commander declares a “knock it off”.  Missions may require multiple cyberspace force  packages  to  conduct  multiple  sorties  in  order  to  accomplish  mission  objectives. (TASKORD 14-005)
